Her tips on reading people, and on learning from FBI journals, are, in my humble opinion, inspired. And of course, for us guys, it doesn't hurt that she's gorgeous.

919096,A2XGFPVV6P815H,B000A2UBNY,J. Rubino,"[65, 68]","With the huge number of new products hitting the market and a couple of marginal offerings from other name players I was not sure what to expect... Wow! This DVD is very good and has more advanced material than ""any"" other DVD currently on the market. I was blown away by the amount and specific kind of material here. Her section on reading and profiling players is phenomenal, beyond anything I have read or seen elsewhere. The amount of information and the detail of this section is by itself worth much more than the cost of the DVD. I would venture to say there will be a huge buzz in the poker world when word gets out of what is in this DVD. The pros are sure to be upset that she has given away trade secrets.If there are any minuses they are very small. Several times she jumps back and forth between limit and no limit holdem causing mild confusion but once you've watched it the second or third time you don't even notice. The only thing that really bothered me at all was her statement that poker is not gambling but investing. That may be true for professionals but the average player does not yet play or think at that level so a statement like that is a little misguided in my opinion. If a player can lose their money, it is still gambling.She reveals so much more advanced material than any of the other DVDs that I have bought that purely from a value standpoint it is worth much more than any of the other DVDs. Despite my pet peeves I still give it 5 stars; it is so far beyond my expectations of both material and price. This is by far the ""single"" best poker product(book or video) I've bought this year. I think the producers don't realize the value here and could easily have asked for twice as much money.  Get it as soon as possible. I promise you will love it.",5,it will blow you away...,1132444800,"11 20, 2005",2005,1787,"['huge', 'number', 'new', 'products', 'hitting', 'market', 'couple', 'marginal', 'offerings', 'other', 'name', 'players', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'Wow', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'more', 'advanced', 'material', 'other', 'DVD', 'currently', 'market', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'amount', 'specific', 'kind', 'material', 'here', 'section', 'reading', 'profiling', 'players', 'phenomenal', 'anything', 'have', 'read', 'seen', 'elsewhere', 'amount', 'information', 'detail', 'section', 'worth', 'much', 'more', 'cost', 'DVD', 'would', 'venture', 'say', 'will', 'be', 'huge', 'buzz', 'poker', 'world', 'when', 'word', 'what', 'DVD', 'pros', 'are', 'sure', 'be', 'upset', 'given', 'away', 'trade', 'secrets.If', 'are', 'minuses', 'are', 'very', 'small', 'Several', 'times', 'back', 'forth', 'limit', 'limit', 'holdem', 'causing', 'mild', 'confusion', 'once', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'second', 'third', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'bothered', 'was', 'statement', 'poker', 'not', 'gambling', 'investing', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'professionals', 'average', 'player', 'not', 'yet', 'play', 'think', 'level', 'so', 'statement', 'little', 'misguided', 'opinion', 'player', 'can', 'lose', 'money', 'still', 'gambling.She', 'reveals', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'advanced', 'material', 'other', 'DVDs', 'have', 'bought', 'purely', 'value', 'standpoint', 'worth', 'much', 'more', 'other', 'DVDs', 'pet', 'peeves', 'still', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'so', 'far', 'expectations', 'material', 'price', 'far', 'single', 'best', 'poker', 'product', 'book', 'video', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'year', 'think', 'producers', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'value', 'here', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'asked', 'twice', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'Get', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'promise', 'will', 'love']",Annie Duke's Advanced Texas Hold 'Em Secrets: How to Beat the Big Boys
919097,A2VZA7NZR75G3T,B000A2UBNY,Kevin O'Mahoney,"[1, 2]","Production is pretty poor; it's just Duke sitting at a poker table with a deck of cards. She's serious about poker and watching her explain poker is never fun.  That said, there were more than a few gold nuggets here that have improved my game: slow playing a dry board, physical tells to watch for, how to play against a very aggressive opponent, how to disguise your betting patterns, etc.  If you're fairly new to poker, this is a very good purchase. And if you know the game well, you'll still pick up some good info.  The portion on tells was very revealing; in fact, when I selected a jury recently for a trial I observed many tells of the potential jurors based on what Duke described on this DVD.  Duke is, no doubt, an incredible poker player.

919098,A2FSEGZDAONS2U,B000A2UBNY,Movie Madman,"[35, 35]","This DVD is pretty good, but the reviews I had read led me to believe I was really going to get an amazing batch of pro secrets. The DVD is good and she does tell some things that you probably haven't heard anywhere else. I am speaking specifically about her ideas she got from her conversations with the FBI and her tips on how to deal with a maniac at the table. I really thought those two areas were exceptional. It always seems like common sense after you hear it, but she really does clear a lot of things up and does a good job of providing a lot of information.A few downsides to mention: She discusses a lot about tells and sizing up an opponent. I only play online, so this stuff didn't help me. Also, when she discusses a tell, she performs it herself as she talks about it. When Lederer discussed tells in his DVD, he had actors play them out in a scenario, which I thought was both entertaining and more helpful to remember. The DVD never leaves a poker table with her just talking--which decreases the desire to watch it a lot of times. Had she ventured into the casino a few times to show a hand or something to change things up a little, I think it would have been better. Basically, the DVD gets a little boring after watching it a time or two.Wrapping up this review, you have Annie Duke sharing her thoughts on how to take care of business at the poker table. It might not be the most entertaining DVD you ever buy, but there is some good information on the DVD. Definitely worth the price to have a pro player give up 90 minutes of their time. If you only play poker online, you can skip this one and wait for her online poker DVD. It should be a better choice. If you play some live poker, I think you'll definitely want to know the information on this DVD. It could really make you more dangerous at the tables.",4,"One of the better poker DVDs, just a little boring",1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,1832,"['DVD', 'pretty', 'good', 'reviews', 'had', 'read', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'get', 'amazing', 'batch', 'pro', 'secrets', 'DVD', 'good', 'tell', 'things', 'probably', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'anywhere', 'else', 'am', 'speaking', 'specifically', 'ideas', 'got', 'conversations', 'FBI', 'tips', 'how', 'deal', 'maniac', 'table', 'really', 'thought', 'two', 'areas', 'were', 'exceptional', 'always', 'common', 'sense', 'hear', 'really', 'clear', 'lot', 'things', 'up', 'good', 'job', 'providing', 'lot', 'information.A', 'few', 'downsides', 'mention', 'lot', 'tells', 'sizing', 'up', 'opponent', 'only', 'play', 'online', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'Also', 'when', 'tell', 'When', 'Lederer', 'discussed', 'tells', 'DVD', 'had', 'actors', 'play', 'out', 'scenario', 'thought', 'was', 'entertaining', 'more', 'helpful', 'remember', 'DVD', 'never', 'poker', 'table', 'just', 'talking', 'desire', 'watch', 'lot', 'times', 'Had', 'ventured', 'casino', 'few', 'times', 'show', 'hand', 'something', 'change', 'things', 'up', 'little', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Basically', 'DVD', 'little', 'boring', 'watching', 'time', 'two.Wrapping', 'up', 'review', 'have', 'Annie', 'Duke', 'sharing', 'thoughts', 'how', 'take', 'care', 'business', 'poker', 'table', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'entertaining', 'DVD', 'ever', 'buy', 'good', 'information', 'DVD', 'Definitely', 'price', 'have', 'pro', 'player', 'give', 'up', '90', 'minutes', 'time', 'only', 'play', 'poker', 'online', 'can', 'skip', 'one', 'wait', 'online', 'poker', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'better', 'choice', 'play', 'live', 'poker', 'think', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'want', 'know', 'information', 'DVD', 'could', 'really', 'make', 'more', 'dangerous', 'tables']",Annie Duke's Advanced Texas Hold 'Em Secrets: How to Beat the Big Boys
