I can say that this little story about a day in the life of this family, and especially the mother, does have a certain charm to it.  And the acting is very well done.But here is the thing that really turned me off:  This day is very hectic.  My, my.  All the things the mother has to do in this day.  What a busy, almost intolerable day.  My. my.  Of course, most of us have to do all that stuff, and still go to work.  We get up at 4:30 every morning, do EVERYTHING this mother has to do, put in 8 serious hours, commute, trust our children to daycare, come home, clean, cook, shop, be cheerful....Some people think that is a choice.  But for most of us, it isn't.  It is just the reality of needing a paycheck.  So, this movie just didn't click with me.

1296033,A3M4C2VDWYJSSA,B002VRNJFI,Compusurge,"[20, 25]","Greenwhich Village, NY (specifically the west village) provides the backdrop for this totally fun romantic comedy about a mom who has to plan out one crazy, yet typical mom-day that in this instance includes tonight's 6 year b-day party, but also includes protecting her car, saving her bike, getting the right goodie-bags, befriending her friend (Minnie Driver)and of course writing her blog about being a mom. Whew....Uma Thurman, in a role so entirely different than anything she's done before, plays 'mom' and is fantastic! Her relationship with her husband (Anthony Edwards) seem quite real-life in that he wants to be of help but hey... he is a man, right? There IS a bit of magic between them indeed and while it might not be on the scale of ""Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan"" (yet), it peeks through nonetheless and proves itself by the end of the film in a scene sure to win you over entirely. I could envision the two together in more films going forward...Minnie Driver plays the perfect supporting role as 'insightful best friend' and while the movie runs along a somewhat predictable course at times, it also provides some very nice surprises and follows that formula that always wins while laying in some interesting insights into what it's like to be a mom. I can see the mommy-blogs launching new discussions for sure and a plethora of subjects. OK OK... I realize that I am not a mom, but I am married to one...If you enjoy films like Moonstruck, Sleepless in Seattle, Mask, You've Got Mail and so on, Motherhood is a likely winner for you.",5,totally fun / totally entertaining...

1296035,A1V7RL4ODXXWDM,B002VRNJFI,"Jennifer Bogart ""@ Quiverfullfamily.com""","[1, 4]","As a mommy blogger (although often an AWOL one during this pregnancy and move), I could easily sympathize with the plight of Uma Thurman's character Eliza in Motherhood.  Children to raise, household responsibilities, trying to find some time to write (throw in homeschooling and home business, and yes - it's a full plate.)However, despite some similarities in our lives I found myself disliking Eliza.  She complains all the time, even though her husband helps with the children and much of her day actually isn't spent with them.  She does come to some sense of contentment with her life, but then is `delivered' from some of her family responsibilities so that she can spend more time writing (while someone else cares for her children.)Sigh.  Isn't this so reflective of modern motherhood?  Moms who always feel that they need to escape from their little ones in order to pursue their own goals and fulfillment? Don't get me wrong, I too love to write, and time needs to be spent developing our gifts.  We do need to be careful to harmonize this with our job as moms however, and not forever be trying to escape maternal responsibilities (trust me, that strategy just doesn't work!)Another point against Motherhood is that you can't watch it with your children.  Despite the child-friendly DVD cover and mainly appropriate content there was a scene that completely took me by surprise that includes a very sexual conversation and ongoing references to that conversation.  If you are like me, films that can't be watched in a family setting just don't make it out of the box and into the disc player - the time I have available to watch DVDs is just too limited.So, unfortunately this mommy blogger was disappointed in a film that held the promise of both laughter and camaraderie.",2,Not Family Friendly,1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,1785,"['mommy', 'blogger', 'often', 'AWOL', 'one', 'pregnancy', 'move', 'could', 'easily', 'sympathize', 'plight', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'character', 'Eliza', 'Motherhood', 'Children', 'raise', 'household', 'responsibilities', 'trying', 'find', 'time', 'write', 'throw', 'homeschooling', 'home', 'business', 'yes', 'full', 'plate', 'However', 'similarities', 'lives', 'found', 'disliking', 'Eliza', 'time', 'even', 'husband', 'children', 'much', 'day', 'actually', ""n't"", 'spent', 'come', 'sense', 'contentment', 'life', 'then', 'delivered', 'family', 'responsibilities', 'can', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'writing', 'someone', 'else', 'children.', 'Sigh', ""n't"", 'so', 'reflective', 'modern', 'motherhood', 'Moms', 'who', 'always', 'feel', 'need', 'escape', 'little', 'ones', 'order', 'pursue', 'own', 'goals', 'fulfillment', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'too', 'love', 'write', 'time', 'needs', 'be', 'spent', 'developing', 'gifts', 'do', 'be', 'careful', 'harmonize', 'job', 'moms', 'however', 'not', 'forever', 'be', 'trying', 'escape', 'maternal', 'responsibilities', 'trust', 'strategy', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'point', 'Motherhood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'children', 'child-friendly', 'DVD', 'cover', 'mainly', 'appropriate', 'content', 'was', 'scene', 'completely', 'took', 'surprise', 'very', 'sexual', 'conversation', 'ongoing', 'references', 'conversation', 'are', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'watched', 'family', 'setting', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'box', 'disc', 'player', 'time', 'have', 'available', 'watch', 'DVDs', 'just', 'too', 'limited.So', 'unfortunately', 'mommy', 'blogger', 'was', 'disappointed', 'film', 'held', 'promise', 'laughter', 'camaraderie']",Motherhood

That is to say a young woman who lives in an upscale part of town (in this case, Greenwich Village), has a hoard of New Age-y mom friends who obsess over the ins-and-outs of successful childrearing, and herself hosts a blog dedicated to - what else? - how to survive the rigors of young motherhood without sacrificing one's identity as a woman, as a wife and as an individual.  It's a battle that Eliza seems to be losing at the moment, but at least she's giving it the old college try.Written and directed by Katherine Dieckmann, this seriocomic tale takes place on the day before Eliza's oldest child is to turn six.  Filled with mixed emotions at the event and saddled with a husband (Anthony Edwards) who seems more focused on his own needs than those of his wife, Eliza struggles with arranging a birthday party, dodging parking tickets, coping with a studio-shoot on her street, looking out for her elderly neighbor, and raising a toddler - all while trying to carve out a little time for herself to write and to do all the things adults (those without children, at least) normally do in the course of their days.Dieckmann's screenplay is filled with both poignancy and humor as it deftly explores the life of this harried mother.  Uma Thurman, in a tour-de-force performance, captures both the manic energy and utter exhaustion of the nonstop merry-go-round that her character finds herself riding on; and she is fully supported by Edwards as her husband, Minnie Driver as her closest girlfriend, and Arjun Fupta (""Nurse Jackie"") as a sexy delivery boy who, for a brief moment at least, allows Eliza to let her hair down a bit and to see the heart of the vibrant, sexy, carefree woman that still beats beneath all the motherly obsessions and concerns.Although it's ultimately a bit too slight in the drama department for it to rise much above the level of a bemusing curiosity, ""Motherhood"" still has some valid insights to make about its subject.",3,slight but often perceptive look at harried motherhood,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,2059,"['***1/2Eliza', 'Welsh', 'what', 'one', 'characters', 'Motherhood', 'refers', 'derisively', 'urban', 'mom', 'say', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'upscale', 'part', 'town', 'case', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'hoard', 'New', 'Age-y', 'mom', 'friends', 'who', 'obsess', 'ins-and-outs', 'successful', 'childrearing', 'blog', 'dedicated', 'what', 'else', 'how', 'survive', 'rigors', 'young', 'motherhood', 'sacrificing', 'one', 'identity', 'woman', 'wife', 'individual', 'battle', 'Eliza', 'be', 'losing', 'moment', 'least', 'giving', 'old', 'college', 'try.Written', 'directed', 'Katherine', 'Dieckmann', 'seriocomic', 'tale', 'place', 'day', 'Eliza', 'oldest', 'child', 'turn', 'six', 'Filled', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'event', 'saddled', 'husband', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'who', 'more', 'focused', 'own', 'needs', 'wife', 'Eliza', 'arranging', 'birthday', 'party', 'dodging', 'parking', 'tickets', 'coping', 'studio-shoot', 'street', 'looking', 'out', 'elderly', 'neighbor', 'raising', 'toddler', 'trying', 'carve', 'out', 'little', 'time', 'herself', 'write', 'do', 'things', 'adults', 'children', 'least', 'normally', 'do', 'course', 'days.Dieckmann', 'screenplay', 'filled', 'poignancy', 'humor', 'deftly', 'life', 'harried', 'mother', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'manic', 'energy', 'utter', 'exhaustion', 'nonstop', 'merry-go-round', 'character', 'riding', 'fully', 'supported', 'Edwards', 'husband', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'closest', 'girlfriend', 'Arjun', 'Fupta', 'Nurse', 'Jackie', 'sexy', 'delivery', 'boy', 'who', 'brief', 'moment', 'least', 'Eliza', 'let', 'hair', 'down', 'bit', 'see', 'heart', 'vibrant', 'sexy', 'carefree', 'woman', 'still', 'motherly', 'obsessions', 'concerns.Although', 'ultimately', 'bit', 'too', 'slight', 'drama', 'department', 'rise', 'much', 'level', 'bemusing', 'curiosity', 'Motherhood', 'still', 'valid', 'insights', 'make', 'subject']",Motherhood
