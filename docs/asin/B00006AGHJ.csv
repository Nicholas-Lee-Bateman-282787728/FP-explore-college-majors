I had to fight back tears in certain areas of the film!-That's how much emotion this movie brings (perhaps due to the storyline and because I'm a Mom). I agree that the sensitive preschoolers should wait a year or two to view this one.  Nothing really bad - perhaps just scary for a young one.I enjoyed the fact that the horses didn't ""speak english"" but winnied & neighed and communicated with each other in their own way.  Sort of lets the viewer decide what they are really saying to each other.  The narration tells you all you need to know - the rest is left to your own imagination.My kids thoroughly enjoyed it and wanted to talk about it when it was over!  We have added it to our own library of movies & they request to watch it at least once every other week.Good movie! Great story!

There were only about 10 people inside, and the trailers have already been playing for close to half an hour.  Then I checked to make sure there were children.  There were, ok, so I sat myself down.The nice thing about this film was that the creators didn't find the need to have speaking horses.  In fact, with the exception of Spirit's heart, only men do the talking.  The story is a recounting of Spirit's first adventure in the Old West and his first encounter with humans.  His adventure to discover what a campfire was led him away from his pack.  Spirit tells of the hardships he had to endure and the friends and enemies he made along the way in his quest to be reunited with his group (the Cimarron).I must say, it wasn't bad.  There were several touching moments that put me on the verge of tears.  I'm not sure what the target audience age range should be.  I saw 3-8 year olds who had no idea what was going on, and didn't seem to enjoy the film much.  I guess they were expecting talking horses.  The only adults there were the parents of the children.  I saw no teenagers in the theater.  It's a shame.  This film was enjoyable and it does deal with certain issues like family values, friendship, loyalty and bravery.If you're up for a heart-warming animated story, the kind Disney ""used"" to make (forgive my sarcasm, I don't know what possessed them to create Lilo and Stitch, the upcoming Disney feature), then by all means watch this film.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 2 (there really isn't much talking going on)E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a - I should hope not)A (Action) - 3 (a stubborn horse can get into some pretty good action)P (Plot) - 3 (it's a simple plot kids will understand)",5,Too bad more people don't watch it...,1022716800,"05 30, 2002",2002,1806,"['When', 'first', 'entered', 'theater', 'thought', 'was', 'wrong', 'show', 'were', 'only', 'about', '10', 'people', 'trailers', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'playing', 'close', 'hour', 'Then', 'checked', 'make', 'sure', 'were', 'children', 'were', 'ok', 'sat', 'down.The', 'nice', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'creators', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'need', 'have', 'speaking', 'horses', 'fact', 'exception', 'Spirit', 'heart', 'only', 'men', 'do', 'talking', 'story', 'recounting', 'Spirit', 'first', 'adventure', 'Old', 'West', 'first', 'encounter', 'humans', 'adventure', 'discover', 'what', 'campfire', 'was', 'led', 'away', 'pack', 'Spirit', 'tells', 'hardships', 'had', 'endure', 'friends', 'enemies', 'made', 'way', 'quest', 'be', 'reunited', 'group', 'Cimarron', '.I', 'must', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'were', 'several', 'touching', 'moments', 'put', 'verge', 'tears', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'target', 'audience', 'age', 'range', 'should', 'be', 'saw', '3-8', 'year', 'olds', 'who', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'enjoy', 'film', 'much', 'guess', 'were', 'expecting', 'talking', 'horses', 'only', 'adults', 'were', 'parents', 'children', 'saw', 'teenagers', 'theater', 'shame', 'film', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'deal', 'certain', 'issues', 'family', 'values', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'bravery.If', ""'re"", 'up', 'heart-warming', 'animated', 'story', 'kind', 'Disney', 'used', 'make', 'forgive', 'sarcasm', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'possessed', 'create', 'Lilo', 'Stitch', 'upcoming', 'Disney', 'feature', 'then', 'means', 'watch', 'film.LEAP', 'rating', '5', '============================L', 'Language', '2', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'talking', 'going', 'E', 'Erotica', '0', 'n/a', 'should', 'hope', 'not', 'A', 'Action', '3', 'stubborn', 'horse', 'can', 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'action', 'P', 'Plot', '3', 'simple', 'plot', 'kids', 'will', 'understand']",N/A

Beverly""","[0, 2]","The animation, stunning landscapes, beautiful skies and amazingly well done water sequences makes this movie a joy to watch.  The animators get a 5 plus for the very beautiful job they did in this film.The problem I have with this movie is the bit unconventional way that the story is told.  The main character, Spirit, does not have any talking dialogue with the other characters, rather he narrates throughout the movie.  He does make horse noises and gestures to other animals and to some of the human characters, and while these bits of sign language, body language and horse sounds are easily understood by the adult audience, I don't think they are as captivating to the younger viewers as simple dialogue could have been.The animators did a wonderful job in conveying information through facial gestures and body language, and like the Sea Witch says in The Little Mermaid &quot;never under estimate the power of &quot;body language&quot;&quot; it is true that a ton of information is conveyed.  However, in movies such as The Little Mermaid the other characters continued to dialogue so that some of the story is still be told by a seagull, a crab and others.  In this movie the interactions between Spirit and the beautiful mare he meets are limited because they never actually speak to each other, in fact Spirit never actually &quot;talks&quot; to anyone except to  the audience as a narrator.I think the makers of Spirit took a big gamble when deciding to limit the dialogue to the couple of human characters in this movie, which in fact isn't much dialogue, because most of the talking is in monologue form and really simply mirrors Spirits narration.  I applaud the artistic achievement in this film, but I also recognize that many of the younger viewers are going to be a little left behind while watching and may not be as engaged as they might have.There are some interesting bonus features on the DVD, and a young girl or boy interested in drawing animated characters should enjoy the clips on drawing an horse.  I give a recommendation on this one  to anyone enjoying well drawn animation and to the age group of probably 7 to 11 (give or take) assuming those children enjoy horses.",3,Unconventional but very artistic,1038355200,"11 27, 2002",2002,2201,"['animation', 'stunning', 'landscapes', 'beautiful', 'skies', 'amazingly', 'well', 'done', 'water', 'sequences', 'movie', 'joy', 'watch', 'animators', 'get', '5', 'plus', 'very', 'beautiful', 'job', 'did', 'film.The', 'problem', 'have', 'movie', 'bit', 'unconventional', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'main', 'character', 'Spirit', 'not', 'have', 'talking', 'dialogue', 'other', 'characters', 'rather', 'movie', 'make', 'horse', 'noises', 'gestures', 'other', 'animals', 'human', 'characters', 'bits', 'sign', 'language', 'body', 'language', 'horse', 'sounds', 'are', 'easily', 'understood', 'adult', 'audience', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'captivating', 'younger', 'viewers', 'simple', 'dialogue', 'could', 'have', 'been.The', 'animators', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'conveying', 'information', 'facial', 'gestures', 'body', 'language', 'Sea', 'Witch', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'quot', 'never', 'estimate', 'power', 'quot', 'body', 'language', 'quot', 'quot', 'true', 'ton', 'information', 'conveyed', 'However', 'movies', 'such', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'other', 'characters', 'continued', 'dialogue', 'so', 'story', 'still', 'be', 'told', 'seagull', 'crab', 'others', 'movie', 'interactions', 'Spirit', 'beautiful', 'mare', 'are', 'limited', 'never', 'actually', 'speak', 'other', 'fact', 'Spirit', 'never', 'actually', 'quot', 'talks', 'quot', 'anyone', 'audience', 'narrator.I', 'think', 'makers', 'Spirit', 'took', 'big', 'gamble', 'when', 'deciding', 'limit', 'dialogue', 'couple', 'human', 'characters', 'movie', 'fact', ""n't"", 'much', 'dialogue', 'most', 'talking', 'monologue', 'form', 'really', 'simply', 'mirrors', 'Spirits', 'narration', 'applaud', 'artistic', 'achievement', 'film', 'also', 'recognize', 'many', 'younger', 'viewers', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'little', 'left', 'watching', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'engaged', 'might', 'have.There', 'are', 'interesting', 'bonus', 'features', 'DVD', 'young', 'girl', 'boy', 'interested', 'drawing', 'animated', 'characters', 'should', 'enjoy', 'clips', 'drawing', 'horse', 'give', 'recommendation', 'one', 'anyone', 'enjoying', 'well', 'drawn', 'animation', 'age', 'group', 'probably', '7', '11', 'give', 'take', 'assuming', 'children', 'enjoy', 'horses']",N/A

A horse towing a train? That explodes?). But Spirit has one of the best film scores of all time. That's right, you heard me. I said ALL TIME.This is one of Hans Zimmer's finest scores, and Brian Adams's masterpiece. The songs here are moving, badass, endlessly repeatable, and brilliant. Matt Damon and James Cromwell are excellent in their voicework, and Spirit and the Colonel are still some of my favourite animated characters from my childhood. That *nod of respect at the end always moves me to inner tears.One thing that really irks me, though, is the way the horses ""talk"". They speak and enunciate exactly how humans would, except instead of speaking they neigh and chuff. This is fine when you're a kid, but when you get older it gets annoying and childish. And the racial depictions are a bit simple.But hey, enough about cons. This is an amazing cartoon, far better than the CGI crassness like Shrek 4 and The Smurfs that kids watch now. Spirit's visuals are stunning. The landscape should be walking out of a Sergio Leone film or a John Wayne movie. The songs probably germinated from Chuck Norris's iPod.

First, the soundtrack, and second, the unveiled hippy revisionism of the plot.The full horror of the soundtrack cannot be described in words.  You simply have to hear it to believe it, and then, of course, it is too late.  Take my warning... better to imagine the rasping of fingernails across blackboards or the repetitive thump of a basketball in the neighbor's driveway at 2 am.  Bryan Adams manages to craft a sonic enema the likes of which have fortunately been limited.  If the DVD had some way to turn him off and just hear the dialog, it would jump at least to the tolerable level.  Abandon hope, all ye who listen.Secondly, the plot reeks of California new-age aquarius revival.  Let's see... the Native Americans live as one with nature in a perpetually blissful environment, communing with all around them in the embrace of the Great Manatee (or Manitou, or whatever).  The wild horses (Native themselves, because in this tale they were definately not introduced by the Conquistadors) also live at one with nature, with only snakes as their enemy.  Playful buffalo dance and frolic in the everlasting spring of a ""new world"" (why it is ""new"" to the Natives is beyond me, but I suppose ""It's a new day, it's an old world"" was confusing to poor Bryan).And then all is sullied by the intrusion of the portly, cowardly, clumsy and mean spirited White Male Oppressor, dressed in a cavalry outfit for good measure.The rest of the plot is predictable - Horse + Indian Brave battle sinister Custeresque Cavalry Nemesis.  They also manage to prevent the transcontinental railroad from despoiling the virgin land (which leaves some explaining to do - but why let history interfere?)  The only plot twist that disturbes this luddite/pagan fantasy is when Evil Custer-Man has an unexpected Change Of Heart.Anyway, the political undertones are to be expected from DreamWorks (or Disney, for that matter), so at least I knew what I was getting.  I can take the time to explain to my daughter about left-wing propoganda.  What I will never be able to explain away is Bryan Adams.  I think to myself - ""If only I had read the cover!  If only I knew Bryan Adams wrote the soundtrack!""  And yet, this is delusion.  For I would have told myself ""So it's Bryan Adams... it can't be that bad.""Yes it can.

709417,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B00006AGHJ,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[6, 9]","""The story I am about to tell you cannot be found in any history book...""The opening words of Spirit, stallion of the Cimmaron, set the tone for a beautiful journey through a wild, Western America of 140 years ago.Spirit is a young mustang stallion who is defined by his swift grace and freedom to run along the Great Plains and canyons.  He is captured and enslaved by Calvary troops at a local fort, where the Captain is determined to break him into a trophy riding horse.  Through an unexpected partnership with a Dakota brave, who is also a fellow prisoner there, Spirit escapes, only to be returned to captivity among the Native Americans.  But there he meets Rain, a mare that challenges him to care about others beyond his herd - including the ""two-feet"" who wants not to break him, but to claim friendship.This film was like a cool drink of spring water among the soda pop offerings in feature animation of the last few years:  simple, refreshing, and perfectly necessary.  Instead of the usual wisecracking banter that has come to dominate this genre (and, oddly, is way over the heads of the intended younger audience), we follow the story with a simple narrative provided by Spirit's voice, which is never actually spoken in the film's dialog.  The horses all communicate with natural equine noises of whinnying, neighing, snorts, etc. and through easily readable facial expressions and body language.  In this way, Spirit's struggle to reconcile his desire for freedom verses newfound love is heartbreakingly obvious to us.  And Spirit himself is transformed into a metaphor for pure joy during a gallop.Don't worry, SSotC is no slouch when it comes to action (it is amazing to me that the film's artists could so seamlessly combine the several adrenaline-packed chase sequences through such realistic - and gorgeous - scenery).  I knew it had passed the ""boy-friendly"" litmus test when my four-year-old son was inspired to jump up and run circles around the coffee table shouting ""Run Horses, run!"" The animation itself is neither overly cartoony nor tediously detailed, but elegant and convincing for both action and emotion.SSotC is destined to become a family favorite because it really does have something for every member of the family to appreciate; drama, thrills, and a celebration of our shared American heritage.",5,A wild and beautiful adventure film for the whole family,1038700800,"12 1, 2002",2002,2335,"['story', 'am', 'tell', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'history', 'book', 'opening', 'words', 'Spirit', 'stallion', 'Cimmaron', 'set', 'tone', 'beautiful', 'journey', 'wild', 'Western', 'America', '140', 'years', 'ago.Spirit', 'young', 'mustang', 'stallion', 'who', 'defined', 'swift', 'grace', 'freedom', 'run', 'along', 'Great', 'Plains', 'canyons', 'captured', 'enslaved', 'Calvary', 'troops', 'local', 'fort', 'where', 'Captain', 'determined', 'break', 'trophy', 'riding', 'horse', 'unexpected', 'partnership', 'Dakota', 'brave', 'who', 'also', 'fellow', 'prisoner', 'there', 'Spirit', 'only', 'be', 'returned', 'captivity', 'Native', 'Americans', 'there', 'Rain', 'mare', 'care', 'others', 'herd', 'including', 'two-feet', 'who', 'not', 'break', 'claim', 'friendship.This', 'film', 'was', 'cool', 'drink', 'spring', 'water', 'soda', 'pop', 'offerings', 'feature', 'animation', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'simple', 'refreshing', 'perfectly', 'necessary', 'Instead', 'usual', 'wisecracking', 'banter', 'come', 'dominate', 'genre', 'oddly', 'way', 'heads', 'intended', 'younger', 'audience', 'follow', 'story', 'simple', 'narrative', 'provided', 'Spirit', 'voice', 'never', 'actually', 'spoken', 'film', 'dialog', 'horses', 'communicate', 'natural', 'equine', 'noises', 'whinnying', 'neighing', 'snorts', 'etc', 'easily', 'readable', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'language', 'way', 'Spirit', 'struggle', 'reconcile', 'desire', 'freedom', 'verses', 'love', 'heartbreakingly', 'obvious', 'Spirit', 'transformed', 'metaphor', 'pure', 'joy', 'gallop.Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'SSotC', 'slouch', 'when', 'action', 'amazing', 'film', 'artists', 'could', 'so', 'seamlessly', 'combine', 'several', 'adrenaline-packed', 'chase', 'sequences', 'such', 'realistic', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'knew', 'had', 'passed', 'boy-friendly', 'litmus', 'test', 'when', 'four-year-old', 'son', 'was', 'inspired', 'jump', 'up', 'run', 'circles', 'coffee', 'table', 'shouting', 'Run', 'Horses', 'run', 'animation', 'overly', 'cartoony', 'tediously', 'detailed', 'elegant', 'convincing', 'action', 'emotion.SSotC', 'destined', 'become', 'family', 'favorite', 'really', 'have', 'something', 'member', 'family', 'appreciate', 'drama', 'thrills', 'celebration', 'shared', 'American', 'heritage']",N/A

My daughter is one with them all, and this is one of her favorite films. Probably everyone who loves horses will love this film.Spirit is a splendid stallion, his story set in Colorado about 150 years or so ago. He is a magnificent creature, the proverbial horse who will not be broken. Captured by US Army soldiers and coveted by an Indian brave, Spirit compromises his otherwise uncompromising character long enough to be freed from the Army encampment and meet Rain, a paint who becomes his other passion, second only to his freedom.The most interesting thing about this film is that, unlike almost any other animated feature, the animals do not speak. Actor Matt Damon does the voiceover, speaking Spirit's thoughts for us, but otherwise only the humans have voices. Another noticeable item is the Bryan Adams soundtrack, a pop/rock set that, like Adams himself, is always adequate without ever making any attempt at originality.At the forefront, of course, is the animation itself. Some unusual techniques are employed here, most memorably the scenes where the film is drawn as if it were live action filmed in a helicopter flyover. Really a striking effect. The detail achieved here, such as the rippling muscles under healthy horseflesh, is often outstanding.Ultimately I'm not overwhelmed with the greatness of this movie because of several things. The Adams songs are one thing, and the cliched story line is another. Kids won't care about that and will love the film intensely in spite of them. But an explanation is needed also, due to the heavy-handed /all white men bad, all red men good/ racist tones that are implicit in the conflict over who gets to be friends with Spirit and his clan. Sure, there have been past abuses, but reverse racism is not the answer. With this one serious misgiving, it's quite a glorious film.",4,"For horse lovers everywhere, with an explanation",1090627200,"07 24, 2004",2004,1906,"['Most', 'girls', 'love', 'horses', 'Many', 'boys', 'do', 'too', 'So', 'do', 'quite', 'few', 'grownups', 'daughter', 'one', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'Probably', 'everyone', 'who', 'horses', 'will', 'love', 'film.Spirit', 'splendid', 'stallion', 'story', 'set', 'Colorado', '150', 'years', 'so', 'ago', 'magnificent', 'creature', 'proverbial', 'horse', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'broken', 'Captured', 'US', 'Army', 'soldiers', 'coveted', 'Indian', 'brave', 'Spirit', 'otherwise', 'uncompromising', 'character', 'long', 'enough', 'be', 'freed', 'Army', 'encampment', 'meet', 'Rain', 'paint', 'who', 'other', 'passion', 'second', 'only', 'freedom.The', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'film', 'almost', 'other', 'animated', 'feature', 'animals', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'Actor', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'voiceover', 'speaking', 'Spirit', 'thoughts', 'otherwise', 'only', 'humans', 'have', 'voices', 'noticeable', 'item', 'Bryan', 'Adams', 'soundtrack', 'pop/rock', 'set', 'Adams', 'always', 'adequate', 'ever', 'making', 'attempt', 'forefront', 'course', 'animation', 'unusual', 'techniques', 'are', 'employed', 'here', 'most', 'memorably', 'scenes', 'where', 'film', 'drawn', 'were', 'live', 'action', 'filmed', 'helicopter', 'flyover', 'Really', 'striking', 'effect', 'detail', 'achieved', 'here', 'such', 'rippling', 'muscles', 'healthy', 'horseflesh', 'often', 'outstanding.Ultimately', ""'m"", 'not', 'overwhelmed', 'greatness', 'movie', 'several', 'things', 'Adams', 'songs', 'are', 'one', 'thing', 'cliched', 'story', 'line', 'Kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'will', 'love', 'film', 'intensely', 'spite', 'explanation', 'needed', 'also', 'due', 'heavy-handed', '/all', 'white', 'men', 'bad', 'red', 'men', 'good/', 'racist', 'tones', 'are', 'implicit', 'conflict', 'who', 'be', 'friends', 'Spirit', 'clan', 'Sure', 'have', 'been', 'past', 'abuses', 'reverse', 'racism', 'not', 'answer', 'one', 'serious', 'misgiving', 'quite', 'glorious', 'film']",N/A

However, I do realize that music tastes between people vary greatly, so it might work for you. I do want to clarify, too, that much of the theme music, aside from the actual singing parts, was beautiful and majestic and matched the big, wide-open west depicted in the film. I previewed it before I allowed my horse loving daughter watch it. I was afraid the mentions of ""animal cruelty"" per other reviewers would be too much for her to bear. She is very sensitive, especially when it involves horses.  I think the only thing the captivity did of the main character/horse is prove his rightful name...Spirit who cannot be broken.  My daughter and I found that section of the film comical in some parts as Spirit proved his independence.  Nobody was going to break him.  Personally, I loved that the animals didn't actually speak to one another. It made the horses seem more real, and I know my daughter loved that part of it, too. They were able to communicate, and the audience could clearly tell what the horse was trying to say.  We had fun trying to vocalize the horses' thoughts as we watched the film together.

Both my 3 year old son and 5 year old daughter just can't get enough of it.  I got it at first because so many movies out there are ""girl"" oriented and I wanted something for my son to watch that was a little ""rough and tumble"" but didn't include violence.  This one does have a female horse that Spirit comes to care for, but no gushy love stuff.  I also really appreciate that the animals don't talk, though you hear Spirit's thoughts as narrative.The gist of the movie is that Spirit is a wild stallion captured by Union forces while they are building the first railroad track across the country.  Through sheer will he escapes (with some help from a captured Native American man).  He then is captured by his Native American tribe who treat him kindly, but Spirit will not let himself be broken.  Out of respect for his spirit (pun intended), the Native American man lets him go free.  Unfortunately, the Union soldiers attack and, after some (kind of sad) adventure, Spirit is once again captured by the soldiers.  The Native American man sets out to free his ""friend""...but arrives a little late.  Spirit has escaped again, but does need the man's help to survive his escape.  In the end, the Native American man brings him home where Spirit finds the mare he thought had died after the attack. Spirit is overjoyed to not only find her safe but that her ""two legged"" is willing to let her go with him back to the Cimarron herd.  (Actually, she could have gone earlier but wouldn't go because her ""two legged"" needed her.)  In the end, Spirit never gives in to letting the ""two legged"" ride him, but they part with friendship, dignity and respect on both sides.I have to say, I think I love this movie more than the kids!  I fully expected Spirit to let himself be ridden as a show of friendship at the end, but he still doesn't.  This is my favorite part I suppose, the moral that even if you care deeply for someone it is important never to compromise your principles no matter what they may wish you to do.Just so you know, there is some shooting when the soldiers attack, but all you see are the Native Americans running, no blood or anything really scary.  There are two scenes where the Captain point blank attempts to shoot first Spirit (the gun is knocked away as it shoots by the Native American man) and then the Native American Man (Spirit knocks the gun away as it shoots), but no one is shown hurt by gunfire.  These scenes started some interesting conversations with my 5 year old about how Native Americans were treated when ""we"" took over this land.",5,My kids love this movie,1189468800,"09 11, 2007",2007,2677,"['rent', '95', '%', 'kid', 'movies', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'just', 'had', 'come', 'Amazon', 'buy', '3', 'year', 'old', 'son', '5', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'got', 'first', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'are', 'girl', 'oriented', 'wanted', 'something', 'son', 'watch', 'was', 'little', 'rough', 'tumble', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'violence', 'one', 'have', 'female', 'horse', 'Spirit', 'care', 'gushy', 'love', 'stuff', 'also', 'really', 'appreciate', 'animals', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'hear', 'Spirit', 'thoughts', 'narrative.The', 'gist', 'movie', 'Spirit', 'wild', 'stallion', 'captured', 'Union', 'forces', 'are', 'building', 'first', 'railroad', 'track', 'country', 'sheer', 'will', 'escapes', 'help', 'captured', 'Native', 'American', 'man', 'then', 'captured', 'Native', 'American', 'tribe', 'who', 'treat', 'kindly', 'Spirit', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'be', 'broken', 'respect', 'spirit', 'pun', 'intended', 'Native', 'American', 'man', 'go', 'free', 'Unfortunately', 'Union', 'soldiers', 'attack', 'kind', 'sad', 'adventure', 'Spirit', 'once', 'again', 'captured', 'soldiers', 'Native', 'American', 'man', 'out', 'free', 'friend', 'little', 'late', 'Spirit', 'escaped', 'again', 'need', 'man', 'help', 'survive', 'escape', 'end', 'Native', 'American', 'man', 'home', 'where', 'Spirit', 'mare', 'thought', 'had', 'died', 'attack', 'Spirit', 'overjoyed', 'not', 'only', 'find', 'safe', 'two', 'legged', 'willing', 'let', 'go', 'back', 'Cimarron', 'herd', 'Actually', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'earlier', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'two', 'legged', 'needed', 'end', 'Spirit', 'never', 'letting', 'two', 'legged', 'ride', 'part', 'friendship', 'dignity', 'respect', 'sides.I', 'have', 'say', 'think', 'love', 'movie', 'more', 'kids', 'fully', 'expected', 'Spirit', 'let', 'be', 'ridden', 'show', 'friendship', 'end', 'still', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'part', 'suppose', 'moral', 'even', 'care', 'deeply', 'someone', 'important', 'never', 'compromise', 'principles', 'matter', 'what', 'may', 'wish', 'do.Just', 'so', 'know', 'shooting', 'when', 'soldiers', 'attack', 'see', 'are', 'Native', 'Americans', 'running', 'blood', 'anything', 'really', 'scary', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'where', 'Captain', 'point', 'blank', 'attempts', 'shoot', 'first', 'Spirit', 'gun', 'knocked', 'away', 'Native', 'American', 'man', 'then', 'Native', 'American', 'Man', 'Spirit', 'gun', 'away', 'one', 'shown', 'hurt', 'gunfire', 'scenes', 'started', 'interesting', 'conversations', '5', 'year', 'old', 'how', 'Native', 'Americans', 'were', 'treated', 'when', 'took', 'land']",N/A

Not only was the animation beautiful, and the music fantastic, it had an important message about how cruel humans can be to animals, and that a little kindness to an animal, can benifit both human and beast. Even though the indians used ropes and tried to ride Spirit, they were kind and loving to him,especially the boy, who understands his need for freedom, and eventually sets him free. One reviewer referred to this movie as &quot;smaltz&quot; which I strongly disagree. I don't know how a person that negative can like any animated movie. They aren't supposed to be entirely realistic. They are supposed to have strong characters, and teach valuable lessons about life. I feel sorry for that person. He/she misses the point entirely. And the first reviewer liked the movie, but said it was foolish and childish to like movies with talking animals. I disagree, they are again &quot;make believe&quot; and meant primarily for children. Adults can enjoy them too. They just have to be open-minded and let their inner child out. I never lost mine, and I'm not ashamed. But in the case of this movie, dialogue between the animals wasn't necessary, because their emotions were  expressed so obviously through the context of the story, expressions and movements, not to mention, the lyrics of all those great Bryan Adams songs. Perhaps this would've worked with &quot;The Lion King&quot; and &quot;Dinosaur&quot; too, but that's just not the Disney style, and it doesn't make me like those movies any less. Those are both favorites in my home. You have to judge each movie on it's own merits, and not compare it to others. This is one great movie, and I plan to add it to my collection. Even very young children can sympathize with Spirit's plight, and admire his courage. Great job, Dreamworks.

No, he won't be tamed - and his courage has taken him to rescue Little Creek a fellow Lakota brave who has also fallen prey. Spirit falls in love with a filly mare the brave owns.The animated feature is essentially an adventure of the old West - an uplifting celebration on one's freedom and independence. It aims to be earnest - so slapsticks and barrels of jokes are casted away, where instead Matt Damon voices Spirit's thoughts sparsely and the story unfolds through eight ballads penned by Bryan Adams which unfortunately maroons the movie into oversentimentality.Yet the ride is a pleasure indeed - with rich production and fascinating visuals that remains reassuring old-fashioned. It is an ingenious mix of 2D and 3D drawings to enhance the sweeping landscapes and the vivid portrayal of the horses. Children will indulge in the comical expressions of the horses; while adults will be enthralled by the train wreck sequence where the locomotive rolls down the hill and combust into flames.Spirit stays rooted to its political correctness. The white man who aims to conquer Spirit is none other than the cavalry colonel (James Cromwell). His virulence also endangers the livelihood of the Native Indians and the other horses.

Here spirit is treated cruelly because he won't be ""broken in"" (let some one ride him.) meanwhile he meets little creek, and Indian prisoner.

709451,A2MRZPTMYFADUV,B00006AGHJ,Frodo,"[0, 0]","""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" is one of the most beautful animated films I've ever seen, and in some ways this non-disney produced film actually out-Disneys DISNEY!Based on an old Indian legend, Spirit is the majestic stallion of the Cimarron Herd. The story unfolds in the time shortly before the War on Independence in North America. When the handsome buckskin is snatched from his home by humans, a journey begins for Spirit to find his way back. However, along the way he befriends Little Creek a spontanious young Indian and falls for Rain, a stunning skewbald mare. Soon, Spirit realises that he is torn between to worlds and chasing one dream will mean sacrafising another.Before I saw this movie, I definately had my doubts, mainly because in my eyes Disney animation is the best and there is simply nobody who can beat them. However, on this occasion I had to admit there were times when I was actually COMPARING ""Spirit"" to Disney films. That's a major first for me!The movie is very original in several areas. Firstly, unlike  ANY animated film that I can think of, the main character doesn't speak, but conveys his inner thoughts and emotions through an occasional voice over (Matt Damon) and musical ballads by Bryan Adams. Believe it or, this unusual method was even more affective than the common way and added to the movie's greatness.In addition to the music, the score by Hans Zimmer (""The Lion King"") is absolutley beautiful! The many melodies are incredibly clever and you can listen to it without ever getting board - you might even cry a bit! Bryan Adams' songs are very beautiful and support the weight of the film evenly and cleverly. All the songs are catchy and emotional, as they ultimately capture what Spirit feels and thinks. My favourite song is the inspiring and swooning ""Sound the Bugal"".I was also highly impressed by Spirit and the horses' animation. As none of the horses' actually spoke (except for their neighing), eyebrows (which horses DONT usually have!) were used to such effectiveness that you really could understand exactly what was going through the animals head. It has also been proven that horses are the hardest animals to animate because of their complex bone structure and the way they move. This hurdle was conquered with revolutionary computer effects and by mimicking real-live horses through cameras (very similar to how stunt horses were created in ""Lord of the Rings""). So in that sense, the specail effects were very well done.In conclusion, ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" is a breath-taking, epic feature that I enjoyed immensly. Do not be put off by the fact that it is not a Disney film, because this film is every bit as brilliant as classics like ""The Lion King"". For horse-lovers, you will absolutley die over this film. Even for non-horse-lovers, this is still a beautiful film with a powerful message for everybody - that friendship and love will always get you though hard times.

Here we seethis ""good"" wild mustang captured by the ""evil"" whitemilitary man (shades of the Vietnam era!).  By chancealso an Indian (oops, I meant to say ""native American""-butwait, I was born in the US too, so does this make mea ""native American"" even though I am not an Indian?)is also captured by the evil white military man.The mustang decides to escape and he also helpsthe Indian to escape.  Now, this leads to severalproblems in the story.  First, the evil, white militaryman who wants to break in the mustang has to ""break him"" so thathe will be a docile horse.  But, on the other hand, Indianswho wanted to ride horses also had to break wild mustangs.So from the mustang's point of view, there should be nodifference between the white man and the Indian, but inorder to push this pro-Third World ideology, the Indianis shown to be preferable to the white man, for no apparentreason other than the fact that he isn't white.  The second problem is: what did the Indiansdo when they rode horses on the Great Plains?  They didn't justdo it for fun.  They hunted buffaloes (acutally, bisons), andfought wars, not just against the ""evil"" white men but alsoagainst other Indian tribes.  Now we are getting into severalproblem areas.  First of all, the film tells us that it is badto capture wild mustangs, but suddenly we now realize thatit is okay to kill Buffaloes. Isn't that ""speciesism""? That is, we are telling the story only from the point of view of the horse, but what about the poor Buffalo who is a victim of aggression by both the horse and the Indian?  And, as I pointedout before, the white man is shown to be ""bad"" because he is a soldier, and yet the Indians also fought, although they didn't wear Western-style uniforms.Finally, there is a scene near the beginning where Spirit, the wild mustang, protects a couple of young colts from a prowling cougar.  Although Spirit succeeds in driving the cougar off, the cougar is left hungry.  Doesn't he have a right to eat as well as the Indian who uses the horse to hunt buffaloes?

While the animation is professional, the plot and especially the music is excrutiatingly contrived and summarily uninspired. As soon as I heard the voiceover by Matt Damon, with its portrayal of an idyllic (and unrealistic) West, I knew we were in trouble, but it was the raspy singing of Brian Adams accompanying the playful antics of the young Spirit that moved this film from the category of being not just a bad idea, but simply bad.Perhaps a young child might be enthralled by this movie, able to ignore the inane lyrics and the predictable story. The animators did their anatomical and behavioral research, and the horses actually act like their live counterparts, for the most part. They rely a little too much on the eyes (portrayed slightly enlarged and with much more white around the eye, which is simply wrong) and the mouth (seeing the colt smile grated on me as much as Adams' voice), rather than trusting the body language. And, sure, they don't have the animals speak, but there's that narration that undercuts the whole point of not ascribing human communication to the horses.We had successfully avoided this at the theater, but Jill received it as a gift and we thought, &quot;well, how bad can it be?&quot; It's that bad.

In all honesty, that's scarcely a blow for realism in full-length cartoons, since the they're still pretty anthropomorphized.  They give each other all-too-human looks of affection, sorrow or jubilation.  And of course, Matt Damon's voice over lets the viewer know just what the stallion is really thinking.  So in that sense, they may as well be talking horse sense to each other.Still this is an impressive work of animation.  Children should love it and parents will likely not be bored.  The blend of computer generated and hand-drawn techniques seems to be pointing the way to the future of the art of animation--and it looks pretty darn good.Of course, the story is something of a PC-fantasy.  Neither the wild horses nor the American Indians fared quite so well historically as they do in the film.  In fairness, however, the movie doesn't actually indicate that Spirit's victory is any more than a temporary one, and it would almost be mean-spirited and too much to ask of a young audience to have the film end on a more somber note.

A leader by birth, the movie tells the tale of his first encounter with humans, a journey that will change his life forever.Narrated by Matt Damon as the voice of the mustang, one thing you'll notice immediately is the lack of dialogues, there weren't a lot of speaking parts in this film, and I applaud Dreamworks for taking such an unique approach.  Due to this fact, the animators took great pains to humanize the horses, giving them emotions and personalities such as curiosity, pride and humor.  For this reason alone, it might be hard for smaller children to sit through the entire movie, especially ones that have a short attention span.As always the animation is top notch, something we have all come to expect of Dreamworks.  The portrayal of the beasts were very realistic, it was exhilirating to see them in action, galloping through the fields and leaping over cliffs, they were simply breath taking.  Another thing worth noting is the fantastic soundtrack, with a score by Hans Zimmer and vocal music performed by Bryan Adams, I thought they were very appropriate and easy to listen to with some great lyrics.I admit to having misgivings on seeing a film about horses, and even though I found Spirit to have a mediocre story and a predicatble plot, I was nevertheless pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the experience.  It lacks the humor of Shrek, and the charm of Chicken Run, but Spirit is a worthy addition in the Dreamwork's growing list of animated pictures.

The animation is superb -- I love the way they have Spirit rearing while the rest of the herd gallops swiftly past him, and the wind blows his hair about in a very realistic way. The music is terrific, and the horses move and sound like real horses. This is a great film to watch if you enjoy seeing pictures of beautiful wild horses running free in green meadows. The opening scene, where you follow the flight of an eagle through the American west -- is breathtaking.Spirit's story is riveting and heart-warming -- his saga keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end of the movie. One of the saddest scenes is when he's captured by the cowboys who turn him over to an army general (the voice, oddly enough, belongs to the same guy who played the gentle farmer in ""Babe."") The general treats Spirit cruelly by depriving him of food and water for three days in the hot sun, hoping to break his spirit, which he fails to do. But then Spirit escapes with the help of a new friend, Little Creek, a kind and considerate Indian brave. Little Creek's horse, Rain is a spirited and charming paint mare. At first she and Spirit have a clash of wills, but later they develop a strong bond. Spirit is kidnapped again during an army raid on the Indian camp, but he escapes and meets up with Little Creek, and they return together to what is left of the camp. I love the ending of the film, when Spirit and Rain run back to Spirit's herd and are standing together on top of a hill with the wind blowing their hair.Delightful as the film is, however, there is a note of warning: The horses in this film do not talk, but communicate by neighing, snorting and whinnying. If listening to these natural horse sounds for an hour or so drives you crazy, you might want to steer clear of this film. I've spent a lot of time around horses, so I know what these various sounds mean, but other people might not. However, I think it's an unusual -- and refreshing -- approach to an animated film.This is one incredible movie!

709464,A193A7T1E8CUTB,B00006AGHJ,John F. Frederick,"[2, 2]","The only rival to Bambi.Simple, pure, beautiful story, a poetic portrayal, of the meaning of `spirit.'Wild horse, leader of a herd, separated from its mother in its defense, but who, never giving up, escapes its captors and returns home with a mate.Visually beautiful animation combining hand drawn characters with computer generated backgrounds. Masterfully expressive movements, effectively combining the natural body language of horses with human facial expressions. Sacrifices nothing either to the ideology of having computers do everything or to the ideology of having computers do nothing; it lets the artists' eyes be the judge-and with no meager result. It sets the standard for all future animation.Though the horses do not speak, story line is meaningfully enhanced by contrasting the culture of western expansionists with the culture of the Lakota Sioux; shows the treatment of the horse in the different cultures. Cavalry Colonel was going to shoot Spirit after failing to tame it; Lakota brave sets Spirit free after the same failure. Treats of the conflict respectfully, not making the Lakota out to be ""savages""--neither base nor ""noble."" Spirit lets the Lakota brave ride him in an exceptional moment during a common struggle; the Colonel, witnessing this, learns to respect both and sets both free--though giving no indication that he intends to quit the Cavalry. The horse in the end simply transcends both cultures as it returns to its home, where--as it was explained in the beginning--the wild horses knew no ""separation between earth and sky.""Incredibly beautiful.  While the music was not per se my favorite variety, it all but makes me a fan of the genre; the lyrics are very meaningful and it is remarkably well blended into the story on multiple levels--having the right balance between humor, sorrow--and joy.A few memorable lines from the lyrics:`remember who you are'`can't come uninvited'`it's to you that I will always return...'",5,'if you can't catch a wave then you're never going to ride it',1163203200,"11 11, 2006",2006,1961,"['only', 'rival', 'Bambi.Simple', 'pure', 'beautiful', 'story', 'poetic', 'portrayal', 'meaning', 'spirit', ""'Wild"", 'horse', 'leader', 'herd', 'separated', 'mother', 'defense', 'who', 'never', 'giving', 'up', 'captors', 'returns', 'home', 'mate.Visually', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'combining', 'hand', 'drawn', 'characters', 'computer', 'generated', 'backgrounds', 'Masterfully', 'expressive', 'movements', 'effectively', 'combining', 'natural', 'body', 'language', 'horses', 'human', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Sacrifices', 'nothing', 'either', 'ideology', 'having', 'computers', 'do', 'everything', 'ideology', 'having', 'computers', 'do', 'nothing', 'artists', 'eyes', 'be', 'judge-and', 'meager', 'result', 'standard', 'future', 'horses', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'story', 'line', 'meaningfully', 'enhanced', 'contrasting', 'culture', 'western', 'expansionists', 'culture', 'Lakota', 'Sioux', 'treatment', 'horse', 'different', 'cultures', 'Cavalry', 'Colonel', 'was', 'going', 'shoot', 'Spirit', 'failing', 'tame', 'Lakota', 'brave', 'sets', 'Spirit', 'free', 'same', 'failure', 'Treats', 'conflict', 'respectfully', 'not', 'making', 'Lakota', 'out', 'be', 'savages', 'base', 'noble', 'Spirit', 'Lakota', 'brave', 'ride', 'exceptional', 'moment', 'common', 'struggle', 'Colonel', 'witnessing', 'respect', 'sets', 'free', 'giving', 'indication', 'quit', 'Cavalry', 'horse', 'end', 'simply', 'cultures', 'home', 'where', 'was', 'explained', 'beginning', 'wild', 'horses', 'knew', 'separation', 'earth', 'sky', 'Incredibly', 'beautiful', 'music', 'was', 'not', 'se', 'favorite', 'variety', 'fan', 'genre', 'lyrics', 'are', 'very', 'meaningful', 'remarkably', 'well', 'blended', 'story', 'multiple', 'levels', 'having', 'right', 'balance', 'humor', 'sorrow', 'joy.A', 'few', 'memorable', 'lines', 'lyrics', 'remember', 'who', 'are', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'uninvited', 'will', 'always', 'return']",N/A

Another reviewer writes, ""there's the 'Kind Smart Native Americans' and the 'Bad Stupid White Men.' I mean, all throughout the movie, when the Indian boy got hurt, it was obviously meant to be a matter of concern. But when on the white men got hurt it was supposed to be funny"".The Native Indians are especially in tune with horses, at least. America's critic, Pulitzer prise winner Roger Ebert, may have seen this film. When he reviewed the film Avatar he wrote, ""The Na'vi survive on this planet by knowing it well, living in harmony with nature, and being wise about the creatures they share it with. In this and countless other ways they resemble Native Americans. Like them, they tame another species to carry them around--not horses, but graceful flying dragon-like creatures"".My problem isn't with inaccuracies in this animated film; the Spirit, if I may say, of the film travels counter to reality. Horses are native to North America, yes. Native Americans hunted them to extinction. Others are at least partially useful for they reintroduced them to the New World for the wise natives to play with once again. Lets be fair. Others have done things too.

It was also one of my favorite early Dreamworks animated 2D movie. ('Prince of Egypt' and the unfortunately flawed 'El Dorado' are a couple others that impressed me.)The film is strong on characters and their motivations. Both the animals and their human antagonists really are the movie's strength. They are not only well-defined, believable, and appealing, but also their conflicts seem real and it carries the story well to its exciting and well-plotted conclusion (the audience I sat with when I saw it in the theater in its original release  really locked into this film).However, the choice of artistic design on some of the characters in this film leaves much to be desired. Better design of the human figures in particular would have given this movie a five star from this viewer.The early 3D animation mixed into the 2D was somewhat annoying at times. Fortunately, not much time is spent with the film's early obvious less-than-compatible 3D visual intrusion into the 2D world.'Spirit' is a great family picture as well as good action/adventure movie that can be enjoyed by anyone looking for a real gem that was missed by audiences in its original theatrical release.",4,In Case You Missed It,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,1504,"['One', 'Dreamworks', 'Studio', 'underrated', '2D', 'animated', 'films', ""'Spirit"", 'Stallion', 'Cimarron', 'great', 'story', 'well-timed', 'drama', 'comedy.Although', 'largely', 'unknown', 'unseen', 'most', 'audiences', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'film', 'became', 'one', 'own', 'personal', 'favorite', 'unknown', 'animated', 'drama/action', 'picture', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'favorite', 'early', 'Dreamworks', 'animated', '2D', 'movie', ""'Prince"", 'Egypt', 'unfortunately', 'flawed', ""'El"", 'Dorado', 'are', 'couple', 'others', 'impressed', 'film', 'strong', 'characters', 'motivations', 'animals', 'human', 'antagonists', 'really', 'are', 'movie', 'strength', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'well-defined', 'believable', 'appealing', 'also', 'conflicts', 'seem', 'real', 'story', 'well', 'exciting', 'well-plotted', 'conclusion', 'audience', 'sat', 'when', 'saw', 'theater', 'original', 'release', 'really', 'locked', 'film', '.However', 'choice', 'artistic', 'design', 'characters', 'film', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'Better', 'design', 'human', 'figures', 'particular', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'five', 'star', 'viewer.The', 'early', '3D', 'animation', 'mixed', '2D', 'was', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'times', 'Fortunately', 'not', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'film', 'early', 'obvious', 'less-than-compatible', '3D', 'visual', 'intrusion', '2D', 'world', 'great', 'family', 'picture', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'action/adventure', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'anyone', 'looking', 'real', 'gem', 'was', 'missed', 'audiences', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release']",N/A

Bernabo,"[1, 2]","The opening sequence of &quot;Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron,&quot; in which an eagle flies across the grand vistas of the American West until we catch up with the herd of wild mustangs in which the title character lives was used quite effectively as the trailer for this film, in much the same manner as was done with the computer animated film &quot;Dinosaur.&quot;  The comparison is particularly apt because when I saw &quot;Dinosaur&quot; I was disappointed that all of the characters talked; I thought we would be seeing the equivalent of a prehistoric Disney nature film.  In contrast, I was pleasantly surprised that Spirit and the other horses in this animated Dreamworks film did not talk.  There is narration on Spirit's behalf by Matt Damon, but the music of Han Zimmer and the songs of Bryan Adams serve as the horse's voice as well.Overall, I think the filmmakers more than rise to the challenge of telling a story without talking animals.  This is not a cute cartoon in the grand Disney tradition and &quot;Spirit&quot; is much the better for it, with the expressiveness of Spirit's face exceeding anything you have seen before.  The story is set in the Old West and tells the story of Spirit, a wild mustang stallion who comes into contact with humans: first cowboys, then the U.S. cavalry, and then Indians.  Each group thinks they can tame the wild stallion, but they underestimate their opponent (just branding the horse proves to be an insurmountable obstacle).  Eventually Spirit learns to distinguish between the heavy handed colonel (voiced by James Cromwell) and the young brave Little Creek (voiced by Daniel Studi).Yes, Spirit emerges through these adventures as something of a super horse, constantly doing the impossible, but holding animated films to the standard of reality is hardly appropriate.  Spirit symbolizes the imperative of freedom and as such ultimately earns the respect of the mere humans in his story.  The result is not a great animated film, but certainly a very good one that should appeal to adults as well as children, and since the film only runs 83 minutes long it should not tax either age group that much.",4,"Finally, a pretty good animated film without talking animals",1055548800,"06 14, 2003",2003,2160,"['opening', 'sequence', 'quot', 'Spirit', 'Stallion', 'Cimarron', 'quot', 'eagle', 'flies', 'grand', 'vistas', 'American', 'West', 'catch', 'up', 'herd', 'wild', 'mustangs', 'title', 'character', 'lives', 'was', 'used', 'quite', 'effectively', 'trailer', 'film', 'much', 'same', 'manner', 'was', 'done', 'computer', 'animated', 'film', 'quot', 'Dinosaur.', 'quot', 'comparison', 'particularly', 'apt', 'when', 'saw', 'quot', 'Dinosaur', 'quot', 'was', 'disappointed', 'characters', 'talked', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'seeing', 'equivalent', 'prehistoric', 'Disney', 'nature', 'film', 'contrast', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Spirit', 'other', 'horses', 'animated', 'Dreamworks', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'talk', 'narration', 'Spirit', 'behalf', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'music', 'Han', 'Zimmer', 'songs', 'Bryan', 'Adams', 'serve', 'horse', 'voice', 'well.Overall', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'more', 'rise', 'challenge', 'telling', 'story', 'talking', 'animals', 'not', 'cute', 'cartoon', 'grand', 'Disney', 'tradition', 'quot', 'Spirit', 'quot', 'much', 'better', 'expressiveness', 'Spirit', 'face', 'exceeding', 'anything', 'have', 'seen', 'story', 'set', 'Old', 'West', 'story', 'Spirit', 'wild', 'mustang', 'stallion', 'who', 'contact', 'humans', 'first', 'then', 'U.S.', 'cavalry', 'then', 'Indians', 'group', 'can', 'tame', 'wild', 'stallion', 'underestimate', 'opponent', 'just', 'branding', 'horse', 'be', 'insurmountable', 'obstacle', 'Eventually', 'Spirit', 'distinguish', 'heavy', 'handed', 'colonel', 'voiced', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'young', 'brave', 'Little', 'Creek', 'voiced', 'Daniel', 'Studi', '.Yes', 'Spirit', 'adventures', 'something', 'super', 'horse', 'constantly', 'doing', 'impossible', 'holding', 'animated', 'films', 'standard', 'reality', 'hardly', 'appropriate', 'Spirit', 'imperative', 'freedom', 'such', 'ultimately', 'respect', 'mere', 'humans', 'story', 'result', 'not', 'great', 'animated', 'film', 'certainly', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'should', 'appeal', 'adults', 'as', 'well', 'children', 'film', 'only', '83', 'minutes', 'long', 'should', 'not', 'tax', 'either', 'age', 'group', 'much']",N/A

Inspiring and filled with moral lessons, the movie exposes the animal's point of view before the men's sometimes egotistic decisions.The best lesson is the demonstration of Spirit's unbreakable will, whose heart and integrity are worthy of admiration and respect, even from his enemies, to hold on so blindly to his values and beliefs.",3,Untamed Heart,1118966400,"06 17, 2005",2005,1533,"['Wild', 'West', 'spirit', 'more', 'alive', 'ever', 'thanks', 'animated', 'feature', 'Spirit.This', 'movie', 'story', 'gorgeous', 'thoroughbred', 'untamed', 'energetic', 'brave', 'days', 'leader', 'are', 'abruptly', 'interrupted', 'when', 'American', 'army', 'soldiers', 'capture', 'him.Even', 'best', 'worst', 'efforts', 'tough', 'colonel', 'tame', 'spirit', 'horse', 'yield', 'will', 'before', 'humans', 'eventually', 'rescued', 'young', 'Lakota', 'boy', 'called', 'Little', 'Creek.In', 'tribe', 'Spirit', 'bigger', 'liberties', 'meets', 'Rain', 'beautiful', 'pinto', 'mare', 'not', 'humans', 'are', 'cruel', 'men.But', 'Spirit', 'fate', 'darkened', 'again', 'when', 'threatening', 'white', 'man', 'use', 'infamous', 'are', 'enough', 'emotions', 'Spirit', 'film', 'simple', 'animation', 'filled', 'beautiful', 'landscapes', 'views', 'virgin', 'West.Curiously', 'none', 'animals', 'talk', 'Spirit', 'who', 'double', 'duty', 'star', 'narrator', 'not', 'mute', 'film', 'various', 'songs', 'identify', 'moments', 'specific', 'situations.With', 'epic', 'proportions', 'Spirit', 'virtuous', 'feature', 'nature', 'tries', 'make', 'consider', 'terrible', 'adversities', 'many', 'times', 'confront', 'Inspiring', 'filled', 'moral', 'lessons', 'movie', 'animal', 'point', 'view', 'men', 'sometimes', 'egotistic', 'decisions.The', 'best', 'lesson', 'demonstration', 'Spirit', 'unbreakable', 'will', 'heart', 'integrity', 'are', 'worthy', 'admiration', 'respect', 'even', 'enemies', 'hold', 'so', 'blindly', 'values', 'beliefs']",N/A

But here is a animated wonder that can stand with those films  &quot;Spirit&quot; is full of captivating visuals, textured characters and a well-composed, if somewhat conventional story.  But what really stands out about this movie is the fluency of the images that pass by on the screen.  It is the images that tell the story of the film, and there may be a grand total of less than 200 lines of dialouge, mostly spoken from the many fleeting human characters that populate the story.  And that is something Disney hasn't tried since &quot;Fantasia.&quot;Spirit (whose thoughts are voiced by Matt Damon, no talking animals here) is a Stallion born and bred on the virgin plains of the American frontier in the mid 19th century.  He is a member of a herd, which roams the plains wantonly going where they please, away from the influences of man.  But Spiritis taken by American Army troops when he inspects their camp out of curiousity.  His first obstacle is winning his freedom from the iron fisted hands of American Army horse trainers, who are coldly stern to their aquasitions.  Also along the way, Spirit meets workers on the Transcontinental railroad, and a Lakota Souix boy whom he grows to love.  But above all, Spirit hopes to return to his herdIt is amazing the work Dreamworks has done to combine traditional hand drawings with computer generated images.  Though sometimes choppy in their execution of this art, Dreamworks animators  mostly combine the two well.  Spirit's chase away from potential captors in a canyon is a perfect example, as is Spirit dashing away from a runaway locomotive.One final thing:  You don't have to bea horse lover to appreciate the film, even though the whole film is set around a touchy horse!  The sprawling landscapes will arrest you, and the story will keep you in your seat the whole running time, which is less than an hour and a half.

I suppose animation and computer graphics helps along the way.I had high apple pie in the sky hopes for this movie.  I remember when it came out, it garnered all sorts of good reviews and truly sounded promising as an all-ages family fare offering.  I was disappointed though.  Since we have a two-year old movies we see these days have to be off the G-rated versions.  Of course there are the R-movies to be watched after everyone is in bed but the problem is everyone is in bed including Mom and Dad...so I expect a lot out of my Disney/Pixar/Dreamworks fare these days.  Spirit did not deliver.The movies true strength was the beautiful sweeping animation with Eagles flying horses running and these truly emotive expressive horse faces that told of dialogue in the absence of words.  The story-line was overly simplified, devoid of nuances, and oh so PC.  It reminded me of ""Little Bear,"" in that regards.  The plot I found lacking for the most part but had just enough drama to keep you watching.Overall I wouldn't say Spirit was a bad movie, but I wouldn't say it was all that stellar either.  I think horse-lovers and buffs of all things Wild West will get a kick out of Spirit...I'm still not sure where the Cimarron is.

Instead, it tells a story from an all-too-familiar, all-too-human perspective: That of a cross between radical multiculturalism and animal rights fanaticism. And so, we have morally superior horses, and evil humans who seek to break the horses' spirits. But not all humans are evil: The Indian is one with nature, loves horses, and frolics with Spirit, as if he too were a horse. It is the Evil White Male, who hates horses, imprisons them, and is a danger to nature. (And yet, Spirit's voice is done by Evil White Male, Matt Damon!) The movie makers' desire to impugn white men (or their flat-out ignorance) goes so far as to depict a cowboy roping Spirit's leg. Wranglers don't try to rope a horse's leg. If a wrangler even COULD rope a horse's leg without the rope slipping to the ground, it would break the horse's leg, requiring that the horse be shot.And the animation is as one-dimensional as the storytelling. Look at the water, when Spirit is in the river. Blank. Compare that to the water in Walt Disney's 1940 Pinocchio; it's full of reflected images. Note too the crude animation when the horses are running together. This ain't Pixar. This is just racist, propagandistic dreck, that didn't fool my three-year-old for a second!

You know a film is great when your kids immediately grab their toy animals and start playing Spirit and Rain right after the film is over.  My five and three year olds had no problem with the film's alleged intensity.  And with all due respect to the other reviews here-reviews are always subjective anyway-I felt Bryan Adams was the perfect choice.  His songs fit Spirit's thinking and ties Zimmer's score together emotionally quite well.  Mr. Thomas's review claims there is a &quot;big dose of political correctness.&quot;  Any educated person will be relieved to know that what Mr. Thomas deems as &quot;dose[s] of [pc]&quot; are merely honest portrayals of native people and soldier culture.  If it's &quot;pc&quot; to portray a native person as a decent human being and the Lakota's horse culture for the highly evolved civilization that it was, well then, so be it.  This sort of demonizing cultural accuracy as &quot;political correctness&quot; nonsense just needs to stop, it's the 21st century already. If anything was distracting for me as an adult, it was the frequent geography snafus-the Cimarron is in northeastern New Mexico but the soldiers continuously talk about Nebraska and Utah (an impossibly wide range) and the Little Creek's Lakota village is located in Yosemite Valley... NOT (The Miwok lived there not the Lakota).  There really is no good dramatic reason to mess around with details like that.  My only gripe with the DVD widescreen edition is that the DVDROM games don't work on Mac OSX (must we all be slaves to inferior Gates'ware?).

With it's engaging storyline and fitting musical score, this is an inspiring tale of the little pony that could, or I shall I say, did.In the beginning we me Spirit, the free to roam stallion of the west. We fall in love with him as we see breif encounters of his early life as comes into power as the leader of the heard. Very quickyly see his first encounter with humans, wich then leads to his captivity. The rest of the movie follows his slow coming friendship with an indian brave, as he regains his freedom and finds his heard.The elements that I enjoy most about this movie would have to be the developement of spirit's character, and the greatly enjoyable music. Not only was the music fitting to the emotions and plot of the story, but in and of it's self a work of art. The way they gave human behavior to an animated horse is beyond me. Exept for him narrating, you really got to know spirit's personality throughout the movie.Though I greatly enjoy this movie, there are some elements that I didn't really enjoy.

709510,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00006AGHJ,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[1, 1]","Spirit is more of a celebration of art, animation, nature and freedom than a fulfilling story. If you love movies for their artistic qualities, you will be in horse heaven.The ""Tradigital"" type animation is a blending of hand drawn traditional and computer animation. The combination produces spectacular results. I loved the scene where Spirit and the mare are swimming in the lily pond.The treatment of the stallion did have some cruel elements, but for the most part, Spirit does basically run free and is happy. Spirit also gives the humans a bit of a tossing about, so all seems fair in that regard and he seems to get his revenge.What I did worry about was that children would think that anyone who owns horses treats them cruelly. Which is not the case. The horse is treated cruelly by the Calvary. However, one wonders if when breaking in a wild horse, it would have been done any differently in reality. From what I've seen in regular films, it could be worse.I was trying to figure out the double meanings in the story because I felt it could not just be about a horse. Was this a fight for artistic expression without rules or a fight for individual freedom or a fight against the system? There seems to be a strong element of rebellion expressed by Spirit which is not normally seen in most animation that I've seen. Perhaps they were just emphasizing the feisty nature of a stallion.This movie seems to have been an experiment as none of the animals talk. Spirit doesn't talk and in this story and narration is by Matt Damon. Bryan Adams sings all the song and the words reveal Spirit's thoughts. So, for once you have to actually listen to the words of the songs to know what the main character is thinking. I like Bryan Adams voice, so enjoyed the movie for that element.Otherwise, I really think this movie needed a beautiful Native American princess to brighten up the movie.If you are in love with animation and want to take a visual journey through the West, this is gorgeous beyond all belief. I can only compare it to Princess Mononoke in regards to the scenery.The waterfall alone is worth the price of the DVD. I mean, they really did spend a great deal of time on making the animation absolutely perfect. I wish they would have spent a bit more time on the plot and included some women (ok, so there is a mare) as main characters in the story.The storyboards, animation details and ""learning to draw"" activities add an extra element and if you want to find out more about animation, they provide an fascinating behind-the-scenes look at making an animated movie.~The Rebecca Review",4,Artistic Focus,1046908800,"03 6, 2003",2003,2605,"['Spirit', 'more', 'celebration', 'art', 'animation', 'nature', 'freedom', 'fulfilling', 'story', 'love', 'movies', 'artistic', 'qualities', 'will', 'be', 'horse', 'heaven.The', 'Tradigital', 'type', 'animation', 'blending', 'hand', 'drawn', 'traditional', 'computer', 'animation', 'combination', 'spectacular', 'results', 'loved', 'scene', 'where', 'Spirit', 'mare', 'are', 'swimming', 'lily', 'pond.The', 'treatment', 'stallion', 'did', 'have', 'cruel', 'elements', 'most', 'part', 'Spirit', 'basically', 'run', 'free', 'happy', 'Spirit', 'also', 'humans', 'bit', 'tossing', 'about', 'fair', 'regard', 'get', 'revenge.What', 'did', 'worry', 'about', 'was', 'children', 'would', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'horses', 'cruelly', 'Which', 'not', 'case', 'horse', 'treated', 'cruelly', 'Calvary', 'However', 'one', 'wonders', 'when', 'breaking', 'wild', 'horse', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'differently', 'reality', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'regular', 'films', 'could', 'be', 'worse.I', 'was', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'double', 'meanings', 'story', 'felt', 'could', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'horse', 'Was', 'fight', 'artistic', 'expression', 'rules', 'fight', 'individual', 'freedom', 'fight', 'system', 'be', 'strong', 'element', 'rebellion', 'expressed', 'Spirit', 'not', 'normally', 'seen', 'most', 'animation', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'just', 'emphasizing', 'feisty', 'nature', 'stallion.This', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'experiment', 'none', 'animals', 'talk', 'Spirit', ""n't"", 'talk', 'story', 'narration', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Bryan', 'Adams', 'song', 'words', 'reveal', 'Spirit', 'thoughts', 'So', 'once', 'have', 'actually', 'listen', 'words', 'songs', 'know', 'what', 'main', 'character', 'thinking', 'like', 'Bryan', 'Adams', 'voice', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'element.Otherwise', 'really', 'think', 'movie', 'needed', 'beautiful', 'Native', 'American', 'princess', 'brighten', 'up', 'movie.If', 'are', 'love', 'animation', 'want', 'take', 'visual', 'journey', 'West', 'gorgeous', 'belief', 'can', 'only', 'compare', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'regards', 'scenery.The', 'waterfall', 'alone', 'price', 'DVD', 'mean', 'really', 'did', 'spend', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'making', 'animation', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'spent', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'plot', 'included', 'women', 'ok', 'mare', 'main', 'characters', 'story.The', 'storyboards', 'animation', 'details', 'learning', 'draw', 'activities', 'add', 'extra', 'element', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'animation', 'provide', 'fascinating', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'making', 'animated', 'movie.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

709513,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00006AGHJ,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 9]","""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" breaks with tradition a bit by having its animal characters be less anthropomorphic in nature than is customary in most feature length animated films.  Indeed, except for an occasional voiceover on the part of the main character, the horses in this film never speak (only the human characters do).  In many ways, one respects this effort to keep the film more true to life, but the decision to take this approach ultimately ends up ruining the film for the adult audience (not being a five-year-old myself, I will not endeavor to say one way or the other how this film will play with that member of the audience).  For a film aimed at children, it is striking to discover just how humorless most of ""Spirit"" turns out to be.  There are no singing teakettles or furry little wiseacres to provide the comic relief we often need to get us through some of these films.  Without the wit that made ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Shrek"" as much fun for adults as they were for kids, ""Spirit"" leaves its adult audience high and dry, stuck with a story that is as old as the hills, with nothing but a few good action scenes to keep us from falling asleep.The problem is that, when the main character is essentially unable to communicate with anyone else directly - having to rely almost exclusively on soulful glances to convey all his emotions - the conflict and drama of the story tend to dry up.  And the conflict itself is so simplistic that one wonders if the filmmakers expect their audience ever to have seen a movie before (for many in its young audience, this may well be the case).  We're introduced to Spirit and the rest of his herd living free and undisturbed in the great Far West, when into the picture come the evil, dastardly white settlers who want only to corral the horses and use them as beasts of burden (I hate to quibble over historical realities here, but weren't horses extinct on the North American continent until the Europeans brought them back over?).  Of course, even though the whites are all uniformly brutish in their treatment of the horses, the Native Americans are portrayed as loving and respectful towards Spirit and his brethren and spiritually at one with them.  The PC meter runs dangerously high at times in this film.In terms of animation, ""Spirit"" has a certain elegance in its backgrounds and colors, and its action scenes are executed with a fine fluidity and flair.  The first fifteen minutes or so, before the arrival of the humans, offers promise that the film will take flight as a charming adventure tale.  When the men make their appearance, however, the movie becomes confined and static, with Spirit having to endure hardships, for what feels like ages, tied to a post.  After that, the film never recovers that sense of wide-ranging openness it has at the beginning.There isn't much else to say about ""Spirit,"" except, perhaps, to note that the Hans Zimmer score (crooned by the lugubrious Bryan Adams) is both maudlin and undistinguished.  ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" may be fine for horse-loving children under the age of eight.  The rest of us, however, might prefer to find an animated film that engages both the mind and the funny bone and leave ""Spirit"" for the kiddies.",2,spiritless saga,1038096000,"11 24, 2002",2002,3253,"['Spirit', 'Stallion', 'Cimarron', 'breaks', 'tradition', 'bit', 'having', 'animal', 'characters', 'be', 'less', 'anthropomorphic', 'nature', 'customary', 'most', 'feature', 'length', 'animated', 'films', 'Indeed', 'occasional', 'voiceover', 'part', 'main', 'character', 'horses', 'film', 'never', 'speak', 'only', 'human', 'characters', 'do', 'many', 'ways', 'one', 'effort', 'keep', 'film', 'more', 'true', 'life', 'decision', 'take', 'approach', 'ultimately', 'up', 'ruining', 'film', 'adult', 'audience', 'not', 'being', 'five-year-old', 'myself', 'will', 'not', 'endeavor', 'say', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'how', 'film', 'will', 'play', 'member', 'audience', 'film', 'aimed', 'children', 'striking', 'discover', 'just', 'how', 'humorless', 'most', 'Spirit', 'out', 'be', 'are', 'singing', 'teakettles', 'furry', 'little', 'wiseacres', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'often', 'need', 'get', 'films', 'wit', 'made', 'Toy', 'Story', '2', 'Shrek', 'much', 'fun', 'adults', 'were', 'kids', 'Spirit', 'adult', 'audience', 'high', 'dry', 'stuck', 'story', 'as', 'old', 'hills', 'nothing', 'few', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'keep', 'falling', 'asleep.The', 'problem', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'essentially', 'unable', 'communicate', 'anyone', 'else', 'directly', 'having', 'rely', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'soulful', 'glances', 'convey', 'emotions', 'conflict', 'drama', 'story', 'tend', 'dry', 'up', 'conflict', 'so', 'simplistic', 'one', 'wonders', 'filmmakers', 'expect', 'audience', 'ever', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'many', 'young', 'audience', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'case', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Spirit', 'rest', 'herd', 'living', 'free', 'undisturbed', 'great', 'Far', 'West', 'when', 'picture', 'come', 'evil', 'dastardly', 'white', 'settlers', 'who', 'want', 'only', 'corral', 'horses', 'use', 'beasts', 'burden', 'hate', 'quibble', 'over', 'historical', 'realities', 'here', 'were', ""n't"", 'horses', 'extinct', 'North', 'American', 'continent', 'Europeans', 'brought', 'back', 'course', 'even', 'whites', 'are', 'uniformly', 'brutish', 'treatment', 'horses', 'Native', 'Americans', 'are', 'portrayed', 'loving', 'respectful', 'towards', 'Spirit', 'brethren', 'spiritually', 'one', 'PC', 'meter', 'dangerously', 'high', 'times', 'film.In', 'terms', 'animation', 'Spirit', 'certain', 'elegance', 'backgrounds', 'colors', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'executed', 'fine', 'fluidity', 'flair', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'so', 'arrival', 'humans', 'offers', 'promise', 'film', 'will', 'take', 'flight', 'charming', 'adventure', 'tale', 'When', 'men', 'make', 'appearance', 'however', 'movie', 'confined', 'static', 'Spirit', 'having', 'endure', 'hardships', 'what', 'feels', 'ages', 'tied', 'post', 'film', 'never', 'sense', 'wide-ranging', 'openness', 'beginning.There', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'say', 'Spirit', 'perhaps', 'note', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'score', 'crooned', 'lugubrious', 'Bryan', 'Adams', 'maudlin', 'undistinguished', 'Spirit', 'Stallion', 'Cimarron', 'may', 'be', 'fine', 'horse-loving', 'children', 'age', 'eight', 'rest', 'however', 'might', 'prefer', 'find', 'animated', 'film', 'mind', 'funny', 'bone', 'leave', 'Spirit', 'kiddies']",N/A

In doing so, the filmmakers conveyed onto film the same feel that exists in the work of the great Western artists, like Frederic Remington, Charles Russell, and Frank Tenney Johnson. It's familiar and refreshing at the same time, but the really amazing feat is that of the horsey heroes. Their faces are rather stylized (horses don't have eyebrows, folks!) and their eyes have been made with human-like sclera showing to help facilitate a range of expressions, but as someone who knows horses very well, I was continually amazed and delighted by the accuracy of the horse's movements in all gaits, and even swimming and rolling. It's breathtaking.The DVD's additional release material includes audio commentary from directors Lorna Cook and Kelly Asbury, plus a bonus short ""Learn to Draw Spirit with James Baxter"", and a featurette ""Film Music with Bryan Adams"". There is also the obligatory film-to-storyboard comparison, and an interactive game called ""Make-A-Movie Studio"", which I could not get to work... I guess you have to be about nine years old to figure out some of the more complicated features.Staci Layne Wilson",5,It's got the spirit!,1104969600,"01 6, 2005",2005,1713,"['Old', 'West', 'adventure', 'saucy', 'dun-colored', 'Mustang', 'stallion', 'birth', 'plains', 'Cimarron', 'capture', 'U.S.', 'Cavalry', 'escape', 'friendly', 'foray', 'life', 'native', 'American', 'brave', 'Little', 'Creek', 'Little', 'Creek', 'prized', 'pinto', 'mare', 'Rain', 'Rain', 'Spirit', 'fall', 'forelock', 'fetlocks', 'other', 'unstoppable', 'forces', 'drive', 'apart.The', 'hands-on', 'painterly', 'look', 'traditional', 'animation', 'instead', 'popular', 'CGI', 'computer', 'generated', 'imagery', 'was', 'used', 'Shrek', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'have', 'been', 'significant', 'choice', 'doing', 'so', 'filmmakers', 'conveyed', 'film', 'same', 'feel', 'work', 'great', 'Western', 'artists', 'Frederic', 'Remington', 'Charles', 'Russell', 'Frank', 'Tenney', 'Johnson', 'familiar', 'refreshing', 'same', 'time', 'really', 'amazing', 'feat', 'horsey', 'heroes', 'are', 'rather', 'stylized', 'horses', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'eyebrows', 'folks', 'eyes', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'human-like', 'sclera', 'showing', 'help', 'facilitate', 'range', 'expressions', 'someone', 'who', 'horses', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'continually', 'amazed', 'delighted', 'accuracy', 'horse', 'movements', 'gaits', 'even', 'swimming', 'rolling', 'breathtaking.The', 'DVD', 'additional', 'release', 'material', 'audio', 'commentary', 'directors', 'Lorna', 'Cook', 'Kelly', 'Asbury', 'bonus', 'short', 'Learn', 'Draw', 'Spirit', 'James', 'Baxter', 'featurette', 'Film', 'Music', 'Bryan', 'Adams', 'also', 'obligatory', 'film-to-storyboard', 'comparison', 'interactive', 'game', 'called', 'Make-A-Movie', 'Studio', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'work', 'guess', 'have', 'be', 'nine', 'years', 'old', 'figure', 'out', 'more', 'complicated', 'features.Staci', 'Layne', 'Wilson']",N/A

In real life, animals don't sing, talk or dance. This is a story of a wild horse named Spirit. Plus you have 15 songs in this movie pefromed by Bryan Adams, which includes a duet he does that plays over the end credits. As the movie opens, a colt is born, and it grows into a horse named Spirit (I guess). The movie is narratored by Matt Damon. When Spirit is older, a army comes to his home land and captures him and takes him to a ranch, where he is tired by an soldier to ride him, which lands him tied to a post, where his ordered not to have food or water for 3 days.

The animation was truly great.  The sweeping vistas of the West and the scenes of the galloping mustangs were everything I expected and more.  I also liked the creative and interesting way the creators used the body language, facial expressions and non-verbal vocalizations of the horses rather than human speech to convey conversation. I think kids will enjoy this for the most part, but there is a lot of trauma for the hero mustang to get through. I thought that Bryan Adams soundtrack detracted from and intruded on the movie. The lyrics were corny and the 80s sound of the music made a discordant note each time it surfaced. There were several awful cliches that I'd prefer not to see anywhere, least of all in a children's film. We see a female brown and white pinto using her feminine wiles to tame the rugged wild mustang. (We know she's a hotty because of the long blonde mane, forelock and tail, the big blue eyes and the coquettish postures and facial expressions.) He can't escape her charms and he gives up his ""masculine"" freedom for her. When the Native American hero character first comes on the screen he is dragged up to the post commander at the fort who says something to the effect of, ""Not as tall as the Cheyennes, not as fine of bone as the Crow...a Lakota."" If that isn't bad enough, pretty much everything else concerning Native Americans is either exaggerated or false or cliche. I won't reveal the ending because it would spoil the story but I will say that it is totally absurd and paints a very untrue resolution to the ""taming"" of the West. This movie is after all, a children's movie and so of course I didn't expect realism or anything like it, but falsity is another matter. The action sequences were all completely and totally impossible which would be okay for a truly cartoonish plot, but this is portrayed as semi-realistic, quasi-historical.
