While I am not very athletic, I am able to exercise to this video & keep up.  It is so much fun & so relaxing.  I am not allowed to do the weights on the arm exercises, but I do follow along without holding the bottles. Ikeep the aerobic very low impact with no running, jumping, & bouncing, nor do I do quick turns & yet the workout is effective & doable. I enjoy the aerobic portion; however, I do my own floor exercises that I know that I can safely do.  Most importantly I am loosing some weight, toning up, & feeling healthier.  The music is good from the 50's & 60's.  Richard does cue you in to your next move.  He is pleasant on this DVD & only says just enough so as not to be distracting or annoying.  Thank you Richard & the gang for a job well done.

1156890,A2QYV7LL3OCXJ,B0017HEYGG,R Helen,"[0, 0]","I think this is probably my favourite of the ""Sweatin'"" videos because it is the best all around workout. Not only do you have the fun cardio dance routines, but you get some strength training and floor work, as well. None of the other videos do this, unfortunately. If I had one complaint with Richard's videos, it would be that he doesn't put enough focus on these areas (especially strength training). But ""Sweatin' 2"" has great new songs (we move from the prom to Pop's diner this time) and the dance steps are just as easy. Again, as I said in my other reviews, you have to take the time to learn them first, but it is worth it once you do! If you liked ""Sweatin' 1,"" then you will also love this.
