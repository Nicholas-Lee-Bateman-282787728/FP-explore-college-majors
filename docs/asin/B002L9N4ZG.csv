While I appreciate the anger of people over the release/nonrelease of the different seasons, etc. I didn't read the feedback to learn about how upset people were.  I wanted to know what episodes were on this particular DVD.  So here they are:  Fear Not (Wayne, played by Randy Travis, deals with his brother Joey's growing fear) The Feather (a con man comes to town to exploit the miracle that occurred and encounters real Angels sent by God) An Angel on the Roof (three truckers are led by a light to an Inn, where it suddenly seems like the first Christmas) and It Came Upon a Midnight Clear, which is my personal favorite, although I love all these episodes.  This one has Monica trying to calm Joey (Wayne's mentally-challenged younger brother) when Wayne is caught in a blizzard.  She tells him of the Christmas she spent with Mark Twain.  I was thinking of these great Touched By an Angel Christmas episodes one day and thought, ""Somebody ought to make a DVD of just those episodes, so people could watch them at Christmas.""  And I checked Amazon and found that they had.  I'm sorry that the big fans of TBAA haven't been able to get the DVD's of the show that they want in the way they want, but I'm thrilled that they did this collection.

We loved that a Christian show could capture the attention of the young and the old without being preachy or overly dramatic. And we loved the idea that the God the world has forgotten (and whom we often think has forgotten us) was so present in the lives of each of His people.It's been years since I've seen Touched By An Angel and I've longed to watch the series again so when I discovered they had a holiday collection, I decided to purchase a copy for my holiday collection.The collection only contains 4 of the 9 seasons and is priced at $14, which I think is a little steep but I won't complain too much because I actually enjoyed the four episodes on the disc.There's Fear Not.An older brother (Wayne) is left to care for his mentally-challenged brother (named Joey) and has grown both weary and bitter about the whole experience. But when the angels appear to help Joey deal with the death of his friend, Wayne discovers hope.Then there's The Feather.The day after Christmas Wayne is beginning to doubt the hope he experienced the night before, but when his conman of a brother shows up and tries to take the town of its hard-earned money, the angels make another appearance and help Wayne put things right, while still keeping the respect of the townspeople.Then there's An Angel On A Rooftop.This was probably my favorite of the four. God orchestrates the meeting of a bitter old man and his ex lover's granddaughter. The meeting softens the man's heart and gives him a second chance at life.Finally, there's It Came Upon A Midnight Clear.To be honest, I'm not sure why the angels had to return to see Joey and Wayne, but return they did. Wayne leaves Joey home alone while he runs an errand, but when he gets into a car accident, Joey is left home to fear the worst. To help Joey pass the time, Monica tells Joey the story of Mark Twain's heartbreak and loss and his newfound hope.",4,Nice collection,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,1991,"['When', 'Touched', 'Angel', 'aired', 'television', 'kids', 'tried', 'best', 'never', 'miss', 'episodes', 'loved', 'Christian', 'show', 'could', 'capture', 'attention', 'young', 'old', 'being', 'preachy', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'loved', 'idea', 'God', 'world', 'forgotten', 'whom', 'often', 'think', 'forgotten', 'was', 'so', 'present', 'lives', 'people.It', 'been', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Touched', 'Angel', ""'ve"", 'longed', 'watch', 'series', 'again', 'when', 'discovered', 'had', 'holiday', 'collection', 'decided', 'purchase', 'copy', 'holiday', 'collection.The', 'collection', 'only', '4', '9', 'seasons', 'priced', '14', 'think', 'little', 'steep', 'wo', ""n't"", 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'four', 'episodes', 'disc.There', 'Fear', 'Not.An', 'older', 'brother', 'Wayne', 'left', 'care', 'mentally-challenged', 'brother', 'named', 'Joey', 'grown', 'weary', 'bitter', 'whole', 'experience', 'when', 'angels', 'appear', 'help', 'Joey', 'deal', 'death', 'friend', 'Wayne', 'hope.Then', 'Feather.The', 'day', 'Christmas', 'Wayne', 'beginning', 'doubt', 'hope', 'experienced', 'night', 'when', 'conman', 'brother', 'up', 'tries', 'take', 'town', 'hard-earned', 'money', 'angels', 'make', 'appearance', 'help', 'Wayne', 'put', 'things', 'right', 'still', 'keeping', 'respect', 'townspeople.Then', 'Angel', 'A', 'Rooftop.This', 'was', 'probably', 'favorite', 'four', 'God', 'meeting', 'bitter', 'old', 'man', 'ex', 'lover', 'granddaughter', 'meeting', 'man', 'heart', 'second', 'chance', 'life.Finally', 'Came', 'A', 'Midnight', 'Clear.To', 'be', 'honest', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'angels', 'had', 'return', 'see', 'Joey', 'Wayne', 'return', 'did', 'Wayne', 'Joey', 'home', 'alone', 'errand', 'when', 'car', 'accident', 'Joey', 'left', 'home', 'fear', 'worst', 'help', 'Joey', 'pass', 'time', 'Monica', 'Joey', 'story', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'heartbreak', 'loss', 'newfound', 'hope']",N/A
