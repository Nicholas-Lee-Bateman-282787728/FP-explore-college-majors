321152,A21XVS00AIENLX,6302572088,"G. Jennings ""G. J.""","[36, 37]","I've always been a fan of Patrick Swayze, and this is his best role to date.  Om Puri, another brilliant actor, went from Indian movie star to International Superstar beautifully acting out the part of a humble yet dignified Rickshaw driver.  And any movie that has Om Puri starring in it is sure to be a classic.This is a wonderful tale about two separate lives who cross paths in the Calcutta slums.  One is about Hasari Pal who moves his family from his village in search of work in the city to pay off the money-lenders and to make enough money for his daughter's marriage dowry.  The other is about a disillusioned American surgeon, Max Lowe, who quits his practice after a patient dies on his operating table.  He runs away to India for some soul searching.The trip is no so easy affair when Max gets mugged and Hasari brings him to a free clinic being run by an Irish Nurse in the slums.  While still trying to come to grips with his own demons, Max begins to involve himself with the clinic and its neighbors, soon coming face to face with the oppressive ""godfather"" of the community. Max encourages the neighbors to stand up for themeselves.  Hasari, whose livlihood depends on the godfather, is reluctant to protest until events begin to spin out of control.  Before long, a humble quiet rickshaw driver becomes the town hero.What I like most about this movie is that Om Puri is the central character, not Patrick Swayze. It is almost too easy make the western foreigner save the day.  Patrick Swayze does a brilliant job depicting this balance by allowing his character's hot-blooded, American nature to boil to the surface.  In instances where Max is directly involved, the situation only becomes worse, and Max realizes his rough and tumble ways are only short-lived producing little effect.  So Max inspires the townspeople to unite against the godfather, and they learn on their own that they can make a difference.City of Joy has always been at the top of my list as one of my favorite films.

Swayze's character is kind of annoying, especially at the start of the film, and certain lines seem kind of trite and silly . . . saying that he came to India for ""enlightenment"" was kind of daft and predictable, and of course, the meolodrama with regards to Swayze's character I think was a bit much . . . I don't think you need to have a special reason or event that occurs in your life to make you question things or look for answers to some of life's problems . . . still, the movie did a good job of presenting the inhabitants of Kolkata with dignity and sympathy . . . they were fully human and not caricatures, which was good. Om Puri does an outstanding job here. I wish that Shabana Azmi, an excellent actress herself, would have been given a bigegr role instead of playing the typically quiet and meek India wife, though. The brutality anmd dehumanisation of living in a slum in an overpopulated city was not sugar-coated either, but at the same time many of the people in the slums were portrayed with respect, and their attitude does give a substantial glimemr of hope instead of implying that all humans are ""out for themselves"" as the main character seems to think.

321156,A13TLQ1EQBWJ7U,6302572088,Johnny Na,"[38, 49]","I read the book, have seen the movie and have visited Kolkata.  I'm troubled by the book and the movie.  I felt the book trivialized poverty and made a sentimental treatment of it.  This is because it was viewed through the eyes of a Catholic priest and he was taking voluntary poverty.  Poverty is another matter when you have children, live in bone crushing poverty and have fewer choices available to you.  (Yet Kolkata is a city of miracles in that the poorest can often find a place and a way to survive there.)I don't think the movie came close to showing the culture of Kolkata's poor.  It was very much a westernized gloss and it definitely pulled punches.  Consider just one important cultural element: India has many great musicians who have produced centuries of beautiful music.  But this film sticks us with an entirely western score.I am in love with this region and so was drawn to read the book and see the film.  But if you want to see a film about this part of the world, see anything by Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen or Shyam Benegal.In particular, Satyajit Ray - Apu Trilogy or Two Daughters.

Yes, I too occasionally took rickshaws, once even pulled the rickshaw wallah myself, thereby averting a disastrous hang-over. I did some shopping in Barrah Bazaar right near Howrah Bridge, etc. etc.Yeah, there IS real poverty in Calcutta. And crowding beyond your wildest nightmares.First, I found it ironic that the film company tore down the set once the film was done. It would have provided better living quarters than those of many people I personally knew in Calcutta.Aside from that, yes Om Puri was great. And I think Art Malik, the nasty guy who's father was the &quot;godfather,&quot; and who I first saw in &quot;The Jewel in the Crown,&quot; superb series, was excellent too. And some of the other actors, lepers, etc., were outstanding, given their limited market. (Not a whole lot of lepers in other Patrick Swazey flims...errrrr, films....)OK, it was a cute story. I've seen it now three times--so far--to remind me of the bizarre place I lived and of which I still occasionally have nightmares. But Swazey's lectures to Puri's character, &quot;stand up and fight,&quot; was far, far more &quot;Western&quot; than I ran across in Calcutta. I don't want to bust anyone's multi-cultural bubble but that's simply fact.So, for a Western audience it's credible. But in reality it's a fairy tale. &quot;And they all lived happily ever after.&quot;Yeah, I wish life worked that way. But it doesn't very often.Kept in the fairy tale context, it's a cute story.

321174,AV5G37VFE5NVD,6302572088,Tom Benton,"[2, 3]","In Roland Joffe's CITY OF JOY, Patrick Swayze portrays an American surgeon who loses a young patient.  Unable to accept this loss, he quits his job and travels to India on a journey of self-discovery.  Shortly after arriving there, he is mugged.  Luckily for him, a poor Indian man (Om Puri) finds Swayze and takes him to the ""City of Joy"" - a small medical center and haven for the poor and the ill.  While Puri struggles to find work and provide for his family, Swayze finds himself becoming more and more fond of the ""City"" and its people.Adapted from Dominique LaPierre's novel, CITY OF JOY is particularly enjoyable because the film is as much about Puri's troubled character as it is American star Swayze's character.  The harsh environment which the Indian people live in is presented in all its disturbing glory.  I can't help but wonder, though, if this is truly what India is like, or whether this is just a play on America's perception of India.  From what I've heard, this is a little of both.The film's big problem is that with its often depressing true storyline and absence of anything really new, there's little to draw the casual moviegoer to CITY OF JOY.  Roland Joffe, who did a great job on THE MISSION, brings the same sort of harsh realism to this film; unfortunately, the peerless Ennio Morricone, who also did a great job scoring THE MISSION, provides one of his weakest and least memorable scores.  Swayze is an interesting casting choice, delivering a fine performance as ""Max Lowe"" (how's that for contradiction?); the finest performance, however, comes from Om Puri, who is simply flawless as Hasari Pal.  Those looking for a realistic and moving drama may be interested in this film, but there's little for Average Joe Moviegoer to appreciate.",3,"JOY is well-made, but offers nothing new",1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,1772,"['Roland', 'Joffe', 'CITY', 'OF', 'JOY', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'American', 'surgeon', 'who', 'young', 'patient', 'Unable', 'accept', 'loss', 'job', 'travels', 'India', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'Shortly', 'arriving', 'there', 'mugged', 'Luckily', 'poor', 'Indian', 'man', 'Om', 'Puri', 'Swayze', 'City', 'Joy', 'small', 'medical', 'center', 'haven', 'poor', 'ill', 'Puri', 'find', 'work', 'provide', 'family', 'Swayze', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'fond', 'City', 'people.Adapted', 'Dominique', 'LaPierre', 'novel', 'CITY', 'OF', 'JOY', 'particularly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'Puri', 'troubled', 'character', 'American', 'star', 'Swayze', 'character', 'harsh', 'environment', 'Indian', 'people', 'live', 'presented', 'disturbing', 'glory', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'though', 'truly', 'what', 'India', 'just', 'play', 'America', 'perception', 'India', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'little', 'both.The', 'film', 'big', 'problem', 'often', 'depressing', 'true', 'storyline', 'absence', 'anything', 'really', 'new', 'little', 'draw', 'casual', 'moviegoer', 'CITY', 'OF', 'JOY', 'Roland', 'Joffe', 'who', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'MISSION', 'same', 'sort', 'harsh', 'realism', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'peerless', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'scoring', 'THE', 'MISSION', 'one', 'weakest', 'least', 'memorable', 'scores', 'Swayze', 'interesting', 'casting', 'choice', 'delivering', 'fine', 'performance', 'Max', 'Lowe', 'how', 'contradiction', 'finest', 'performance', 'however', 'Om', 'Puri', 'who', 'simply', 'flawless', 'Hasari', 'Pal', 'looking', 'realistic', 'moving', 'drama', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'film', 'little', 'Average', 'Joe', 'Moviegoer', 'appreciate']",N/A

321176,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6302572088,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","""City of Joy"" has a lot going for it: A great director (""The Killing Fields,"" ""The Mission (Two-Disc Special Edition)""), a great cast (Patrick Swayze, Om Puri) and outstanding locations/sets (Calcutta). It's a worthwhile film with a lot of good and it's clear that 2008's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" borrowed from it, but it's not a standout picture. Why? Because great films take you into the world of the characters to the point that you forget you're watching a movie. While I think ""City of joy"" is a very worthwhile film, it failed to do this for me. Too often I was conscious of the fact that I was watching actors in a movie. Another problem is that the story jumped around without a good sense of flow. For instance, near the end with about 25 minutes left, the story jumps to the monsoon storms and the salvation of someone, which takes a few minutes; it then jumps right back into the main story. If you had gotten up to go to the kitchen you'd have missed it. Bad flow.Regardless, this is a film that can have a positive effect on your life. Suddenly, your life doesn't seem too bad and you find yourself exceedingly grateful for your lot in life. I literally wept through parts of the first half, which is a sign of a worthwhile film, even though it's a mixed bag.This one needed more time & effort to develop, but sometimes filmmakers pull the plug prematurely to just ""get the job done,"" and it shows.The film runs 132 minutes.",3,Life in a Calcuttan ghetto,1352160000,"11 6, 2012",2012,1435,"['City', 'Joy', 'lot', 'going', 'great', 'director', 'Killing', 'Fields', 'Mission', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'great', 'cast', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Om', 'Puri', 'outstanding', 'locations/sets', 'Calcutta', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'lot', 'good', 'clear', '2008', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'borrowed', 'not', 'standout', 'picture', 'Why', 'great', 'films', 'take', 'world', 'characters', 'point', 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie', 'think', 'City', 'joy', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'failed', 'do', 'Too', 'often', 'was', 'conscious', 'fact', 'was', 'watching', 'actors', 'movie', 'problem', 'story', 'jumped', 'good', 'sense', 'flow', 'instance', 'end', '25', 'minutes', 'left', 'story', 'jumps', 'monsoon', 'storms', 'salvation', 'someone', 'few', 'minutes', 'then', 'right', 'back', 'main', 'story', 'had', 'gotten', 'up', 'go', 'kitchen', ""'d"", 'have', 'missed', 'Bad', 'flow.Regardless', 'film', 'can', 'have', 'positive', 'effect', 'life', 'Suddenly', 'life', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'bad', 'find', 'exceedingly', 'grateful', 'lot', 'life', 'literally', 'wept', 'parts', 'first', 'half', 'sign', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'even', 'mixed', 'bag.This', 'one', 'needed', 'more', 'time', 'effort', 'develop', 'sometimes', 'filmmakers', 'pull', 'plug', 'prematurely', 'just', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'shows.The', 'film', 'runs', '132', 'minutes']",N/A
