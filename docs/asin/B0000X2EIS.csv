Instead it's just a slightly different take on the whole ""take no crap and shoot 'em up"" western style.It's about four cowgirls who get revenge after one of their sisters had been killed.  Each of the four cowgirls are distinctly different from the next- one of them is a master of knife throwing for instance.I can't bring myself to really hate Gang of Roses I'm afraid.  The movie contains some pretty good shooting segments (granted, it's nothing that thousands of other westerns hadn't done already and done *better*) but it's just... entertaining.

You may remember him as the guy who kept screaming ""I'ma dead him deader than dead!"" I guess this movie is funny in that it is so awful. It's like watching ""Cabin Boy"", only it's meant to be serious (I think?). Ok, so you've got a band of outlaw cowgirls or whatever who apparently used to rob banks. The group consists of actress Marie Matiko (don't hurt yourself, I'd never heard of her either), LisaRaye and ""Ebony"" from ""Player's Club"", a Lil' Kim who keeps blowing on her guns (do I really need to make a joke about this?), and somehow Stacy Dash was even duped into being in this movie. Also in the movie, there's Bobby Brown with an eye patch...actually there are quite a few people throughout this movie with eye patches, I'm not sure what the deal is with that but you could have a drinking game while watching this movie and drink every time you see an eye patch. Then there is Macy Gray... I don't get her part at all. Oh yeah, there is also a brief cameo from Mario Van Peebles that makes no sense whatsoever. The dialog is atrocious, the outlaw chicks look like they are shooting a video for a Nelly remake of Kool Moe Dee's ""Wild, Wild West"". The plot, if you can call it that, is just flat out stupid. Still, I could not take my eyes off this movie.

Were blacks getting served in bars in the 19th century? Our ancestors couldn't even get served in the 1960s, but I guess it was different in the West. They had relaxers back then too.

Zwick,"[10, 16]","""Gang of Roses"" is the kind of boneheaded travesty that would have given the boys over at ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000"" something really delicious to sink their teeth into.  How we would have howled at the skewering quips and devastating one-liners they would have come up with as they ripped this masterpiece of idiocy to shreds.  Alas, as they are no longer around to lighten the load in cases such as this one, we are left to suffer through ""Gang of Roses"" entirely on our own.  The movie has been tagged as the first ""hip-hop Western,"" which means, apparently, that it features a largely African-American cast in full Western regalia, backed up by modern dance tunes playing on the soundtrack.  Ostensibly set on the 1890's frontier, the film tells the story of a band of former female bank robbers - four black and one Chinese - who come out of retirement to avenge the death of a sister of one of them at the hands of a roving band of killers.Although admirable in theory, the idea of a virtually all-black Western makes about as much sense as an all-white version of ""A Raisin in the Sun"" or ""The Color Purple."" But, even apart from that, the film is so badly written, directed and acted that the whole thing begins to play like one long bad joke, like a distended Saturday Night Live sketch or Amateur Night at the Bijou.  I've seen junior high class projects that were more professional and cinematically accomplished than this embarrassing mess.  Completely at a loss as to how to play this material, the filmmakers settle for lame brained anachronisms, with lines like ""Why you gotta be all that?"" serving as the hallmark of the movie's attempts at authenticity.I'm sure ""Gang of Roses"" will eventually find its way into the Hall of Fame for unspeakably terrible movies, for it is a true classic of cinematic badness.

I wish Mike, Crow And Tom Servo were still around. Gang of Roses would be perfect viewing on the Satellite of Love. This movie ranks up there with Wild Wild Wild, World of Batwoman and Manos the Hands of Fate as prime MST3K material.A gang of cowgirls is out to get buried treasure in the old west. There's the plot ripped straight from Mario Van Peebles' ""Posse"". Sadly this film lacks any of the historical context and story of Van Peebles film or its attention to detail. (Van Peebles actually makes a cameo here, but I actually think they just cut a small scene of ""Posse"" out and spliced it in. If you look closely the frames don't even match up with the rest of the movie.) Maybe the Gang of Roses needs to start running again. Trial lawyers are soon to be on their trail.Gang of Roses has so many blaring historical errors that it comes off as a campy farce instead of a serious western. The gang is a group of three ""sassy"" sistas and one Asian woman. That's right, sassy independent black women and a ""down"" Chinese woman complete with cornrows in the 1890s old west. These women are real trailblazers, because they made a whole lot more progress than Elizabeth Cady Staton, Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman and Lucreita Mott did in the same time period. These sistas and Chinese woman were actual hard-core feminists in a period when the movement of women's suffrage was just getting started. Someone needs to tell these women they don't even have the right to own property or vote yet.If the jackass executive who greenlit this project took the time to read an elementary school history book before filming of this move started, they would have taken the pages of this screenplay and flushed them down the toilet. Then they would have sent the writer of said script back to elementary school to finish their education. Maybe this time the kindergarten dropout would actually graduate grade school before starting work on another silly psuedo-feminist screenplay. The details in this movie do not fit in any historical film about the 1890's save for Westerns made in Bizarro World like this one. In the 1890's there were never:Perfectly arched eyebrows, manicured hands. Oh yeah, let's not forget the make-up that stays perfect in one hundred degree Texas heat.Clean, oiled braids and perfectly styled hair and weaves. Only on Bizarro World are there hair salons available for black women to get their kitchen cleaned up when Madame C.J. Walker hasn't been born to invent the straightening comb yet.No White people for miles except for one man who is sheriff of a predominantly black town. Last time I checked a history book the United States was at least 70% White in the 1890s.Women wearing leather pants. Women wearing pants and men not ridiculing them for it. Women wearing leather pants period. In the 1890's most women wore ankle-length skirts and dresses. Only one woman is know to frequently wear pants in the West during this period and that was the legendary ""Calamity"" Jane Canary. Even though it was part of her unique style, other cowboys of the period often scrutinized her.LisaRaye's white leather costume staying white even though she sleeps in the desert. Hey, why is she wearing a white leather costume in the old west if she wants to blend in? White is a color that makes you a BIG easy target if you're an ""outlaw"" in the dusty old west. Oh well, this is Bizarro World where women wear pants. White is like black here.LisaRaye being a knife thrower who wears a white leather outfit. Like she'd stand a chance wearing white in a room full of guys carrying revolvers with throwing knives.LisaRaye having more knives than a Ginsu factory. I guess She called in the last thirty minutes of the infomercial and got the bonus paring knife set and a set of Ginsu's s great teak knives too.Women in the 1890's wearing low-cut midriff bearing shirts. In this conservative era showing some shoulder and a little too much ankle got you branded as ""loose"". But this is Bizarro World where people from over a hundred years ago still dress like the women of today.The Chinese cowgirl. Eh, this is the 1890's. Most Chinese women who immigrated to America during this period were extremely conservative in their dress and mannerisms. They didn't wear outfits with bare midriffs and cornrow hairstyles, nor did they act so aggressively.The map. For a secret map depicting a secret location, just about everyone had a copy of it.Macy Gray's part. See reason above. I'm still scratching my head about this one.The final frames of the film. What was the purpose of the black guy on the horse?The acting in this movie is some of the worst I've seen since Dolemite. Only Stacey Dash and the asian actress perform well. LisaRaye tries her best, but the material is just too campy for a serious actress like her to make work. (I'm still figuring out why she's on All of Us, she sticks out like a sore thumb in that awful sitcom) Lil' Kim is just Lil Kim hip-hop diva here. Bobby Brown's acting is so bad I realize he needs his Gumby haircut, genie pants, and dancers to ever give a good performance again. Macy Gray should just stick to records.Unless you're looking to have a MST3K party with your friends and you need a film to rip, avoid this Lifetime Television for Bizarro Women pseudo feminist claptrap.",1,This western is is more like Plan 9 from the O.K.

788620,A2UVJD6OOLKEBR,B0000X2EIS,yaremar,"[3, 3]","With this cast and this concept, GANG OF ROSES had me intrigued. I must confess that I actually went out of my way to check out the results...proof positive that I have way too much time on my hands.During the late 1890s, five female bank robbers-four African Americans (Monica Calhoun, Lil' Kim, Stacey Dash, LisaRaye) and one Asian (Marie Matiko)-comprise the ""Rose Gang."" After committing 27 robberies within a five-year period, they split up and vanish without a trace. But when Calhoun's sister is brutally murdered, the ladies reunite to clean up a small town under siege.You'd think that a movie featuring Bobby Brown as a snarling, eye-patched villain and a cameo by THE LOVE BOAT's Ted Lange (as a bartender, no less!) wouldn't take things too seriously, but aside from a few wisecracks from Lil' Kim (the littlest outlaw with the biggest pistolas), GANG OF ROSES is deadly earnest in nearly every department. Apparently writer-director Jean Claude LaMarre (who also appears, ineffectually, as Lil' Kim's love interest) sincerely wanted to make the Great Revisionist Western, and if the film isn't a complete failure, a lighter hand and a breezier pace would have helped tremendously. Because the script wears its solemnity squarely on its sleeve, it's difficult to pass judgment on the performances; many competent cast members dutifully deliver their dialogue on the same one-note level, and Lil' Kim handles her acting chores with the same aplomb that was evident in her Old Navy commercials. (It may be interesting, however, to see how she'd fare in a comedic role.)Ultimately, GANG OF ROSES is what it is: an ineffectual piece of filmmaking for the terminally curious.
