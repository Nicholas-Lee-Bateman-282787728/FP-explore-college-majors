Nick was an anomaly as he was not the usual tall Westerner depicted in many other popular series and he was a rebel figuratively and literally, on and off the screen. On screen, he was Johnny Yuma, a Confederate veteran of the War between the States having served in the 3rd Texas cavalry. His father was a sheriff of Mason City, killed by a ruthless gang that had moved in. It was up to Johnny to rout the villains, and then, finding no strings to his life, chose to leave, to &#34;find himself&#34;.

He runs into a lot of former Confederate soldiers who are still struggling with the issues of defeat and is able to help them out of harmful situations and psychologically as well.  The plots all have very unique twists to them and are well written.  The lead actor portraying Johnny Yuma, is a good actor, but his Ukrainian heritage shows through, which is okay, but it doesn't fit the part of an ex-Confederate soldier.  So sometimes he isn't believable in the part.  And many episodes are rather dark and include either no women at all, or a woman who doesn't have a line in the show.

He wasn't still fighting ""the War"" but his own war trying to fit back into a world where chaos prevailed, never starting a fight but never backing down.  Though his Southern Texas pride was always on the surface at a glance - his uniform - he didn't flaunt it but didn't hide it.  Made in a time when America still believed in justice and that an honest man would prevail.  (The only thing I missed from the original series was Johnny Cash singing the theme song, deleted here due to copyrights.  It can be found on you tube.)",5,Wonderful old series -  My favorite,1395360000,"03 21, 2014",2014,632,"['What', 'wonderful', 'example', 'courage', 'honor', 'was', 'Always', 'just', 'humble', 'chivalrous', 'couragous', 'was', ""n't"", 'still', 'fighting', 'War', 'own', 'war', 'trying', 'fit', 'back', 'world', 'where', 'chaos', 'prevailed', 'never', 'starting', 'fight', 'never', 'backing', 'down', 'Southern', 'Texas', 'pride', 'was', 'always', 'surface', 'glance', 'uniform', 'did', ""n't"", 'flaunt', 'did', ""n't"", 'hide', 'Made', 'time', 'when', 'America', 'still', 'believed', 'justice', 'honest', 'man', 'would', 'prevail', 'only', 'thing', 'missed', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'singing', 'theme', 'song', 'deleted', 'here', 'due', 'copyrights', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'tube']",The Rebel-Johnny Yuma-TV SERIES-3 DVD SET-30 Episodes-Starring Nick Adams
