I love the two part wedding episode at the end of the season where Carla and Turk finally get hitched. Some great guest stars in that season, Tara Reid, Michael J. Fox, Scott Foley, Tom Cavanagh, and Freddy Rodriguez who is funny as hell as Carla's When Harry Met Sally obsessed brother. Scrubs is still going strong in its six season, I am so glad this show never get pulled, I am sure this show has a lot of loyal fans. Brilliantly created by Bill Lawrence, Scrubs will keep you laughing for hours. I love the weird relationship between J.D. and Elliott, will they or won't they become a committed couple was finally answered in the final episode of the season.

971495,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000EBGFPY,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[5, 9]","NBC is sitting on a show that they don't know what to do with. Scrubs just finished its fifth season, and will be back for season 6, though they just can't seem to promote it right. The show does have a very loyal fanbase that is big enough to keep the show going, but not big enough for the show to actually excel. For the first time ever, the show was nominated for a Best Comedy Series Emmy and star Zach Braff was up for Best Actor in a Comedy, both of which lost. Also, it is unlikely that the fan base has grown significantly since it began; I joined late, as I'm sure isn't uncommon, but I don't know of any time when viewership went up considerably. Anyway, despite all that, Scrubs remains one of the best comedies on television (possibly the best now that Arrested Development has been cancelled).The third season began shortly after season 2 finished. Dr. Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke) is still a little down from the mistreatment she received from Dr. Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins), and just when she feels that she can't sink any lower, Sean (Scott Foley), an ex-boyfriend, shows up with a new girl. This prompts Elliot to reinvent herself. On the outside, she becomes a sexy new person, as opposed to the mousy young doctor we saw in the first two years. Though on the inside, she is still insecure, she just hides it better. Meanwhile, Turk (Donald Faison) and Carla (Judy Reyes) are still preparing for their wedding, which causes Carla to grow crazier with each passing day. Rounding out the group of young doctors, J.D. (Braff) finds himself smitten with Elliot again... right after she gets back together with Sean. He eventually settles for Danni Sullivan (Tara Reid), the sister-in-law of his mentor Dr. Cox (John C. McGinley). At first, she is a little spacey, but she eventually turns out to be a crazy party-girl (much like Tara Reid).  Their relationship starts off well, but J.D. soon learns that she isn't as sweet as she originally came off to be, and his thoughts about Elliot ultimately doom their time together.The older doctors have their stories as well.  Dr. Cox is getting along better with his wife Jordan (Christa Miller), and his son begins to grow on him, but when a young female surgeon comes along, his sites are set on her.  Furthermore, his more human side is shown with the tragic death of a character that weighs heavily on him.  While Cox is normally an acerbic jerk, a softer side began to show up in season 2, and it is further developed in these episodes.  Dr. Kelso, usually an evil penny-pincher, actually shows that he has a good side underneath his layers of hatred, sarcasm, and contempt.  The last regular character is neither a doctor nor a nurse; he is The Janitor (Neil Flynn), a creepy man who takes pleasure in tormenting J.D. and Turk while he secretly wants the attention of Elliot (or, as he calls her, Blonde Doctor).  This year, J.D. and Turk are actually able to get a few shots in against the Janitor, as his ideas for getting the best of them begin to wear thin (this isn't due to poor writing; the characters tell him that he is becoming more of a nuisance than an enemy).Other returning characters include Todd (Robert Maschio), a lewd surgeon, Ted the lawyer (Sam Lloyd), who is perpetually depressed due to Kelso's (and sometimes Cox's) constant put-downs, and Nurse Laverne Roberts (Aloma Wright), the queen of gossip at Sacred Heart.  Guest stars this year include numerous Spin City regulars (Bill Lawrence also worked on Spin City), including Michael J. Fox as a doctor with obsessive compulsive disorder.  Other guests include Nicole Sullivan (who was a regular on Bill Lawrence's animated Clone High) and Brendan Fraser returning to roles they had previously played, Eric Estrada as himself, and even Larry ""The Soup Nazi"" Thomas, playing himself (and he gets very annoyed when J.D. asks him about his role as the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld).This year saw the show become a little more serialized than it had been in the previous two seasons.  While the show has always drawn on plotlines from previous episodes (unlike most sitcoms, which uses a more episodic format to allow new viewers to jump on at any point), this year began to have season-long plots.  While I really like that the storylines carry over, it did show that a few episodes were aired out of production order (Elliot's boyfriend Sean left for New Zealand early on in the season, only to return at the end, however, midway through his trip, he magically reappeared in one episode, only to be gone the next).  Still, despite these minor continuity errors, the serialization is, in my opinion, only an improvement to an already great show.The bonus features are pretty much standard by now; we get commentaries, deleted scenes, alternate lines (though in this set, it seems more like deleted dialogue as opposed to alternate improvisations of a joke), and a few featurettes.Some standout episodes include ""My Screw-Up"", which is widely considered to be one of the series' best.  While Scrubs has always had a knack for switching very quickly from comedy to drama without missing a beat, it has never been done better than in this episode.  Another good entry is ""My Butterfly"", which shows how one minor event can lead to two very different courses of action.  Every episode is good, but I will admit that a few of them seemed weaker than normal.  The good news is that a weak Scrubs episode is still much better than many of the best episodes of other shows, but overall, this is the ""worst"" season of the first three.Still, this is a great season of television that will surely entertain you for hours.  Scrubs is definitely a great show that seems to be able to maintain its quality as the years go on.  This is definitely a great purchase.",5,Scrub Up Again With the Doctors of Sacred Heart,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,5773,"['NBC', 'sitting', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'Scrubs',

971498,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B000EBGFPY,Brett Corkins,"[1, 2]","Scrubs continues it's trek onward from it's humble beginnings in the third season. The first season revolved around everything from JD coping with being a doctor, to Turk and Carla beginning their relationship, to JD and Elliot's crazy relationship. Season two continued from there and even expanding upon it. JD and Elliot hooked up again. Turk and Carla became even more close. Dr. Cox even gets thrown in the mix a lot more with the storyline of him getting back with Jordan. That brings us to season three. Following up on two tremendous season isn't easy and they, in my opinion, succumb to the pressure somewhat. Of the three seasons released on DVD so far, this season is my least favorite.Never fear though. Season three still has plenty of laughs, plenty of guest appearances (Michael J. Fox will probably go down as my favorite), and you get to know the entire cast even more. All these things make for a memorable season, but in some cases they seem to have backed themselves into a corner. There's more than a fair share of laughs along the way, be it the janitor becoming a security guard, Cox dealing with his child, Turk and Carla basically becoming one person (funnier than it sounds), Elliot's rekindling flame of season one's Sean, and JD's continued troubles of being a doctor/lover. Everything is funny, just a notch below seasons one and two.Overall, yes, this could've been better (episode wise, extras are amazing as always), but I'm still happy with what we've been given. The cliffhanger is a good one and I look forward to seeing even more scenarios continued in season four's DVD release.",5,Not the best season but still gets the job done,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,1615,"['Scrubs', 'trek', 'onward', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'third', 'season', 'first', 'season', 'revolved', 'everything', 'JD', 'coping', 'being', 'doctor', 'Turk', 'Carla', 'beginning', 'relationship', 'JD', 'Elliot', 'crazy', 'relationship', 'Season', 'two', 'continued', 'even', 'expanding', 'JD', 'Elliot', 'hooked', 'up', 'again', 'Turk', 'Carla', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'close', 'Dr.', 'Cox', 'even', 'thrown', 'mix', 'lot', 'more', 'storyline', 'getting', 'back', 'Jordan', 'season', 'three', 'Following', 'up', 'two', 'tremendous', 'season', ""n't"", 'easy', 'opinion', 'succumb', 'pressure', 'somewhat', 'three', 'seasons', 'released', 'DVD', 'so', 'far', 'season', 'least', 'favorite.Never', 'fear', 'Season', 'three', 'still', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'plenty', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'will', 'probably', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'favorite', 'get', 'know', 'entire', 'cast', 'even', 'more', 'things', 'make', 'memorable', 'season', 'cases', 'seem', 'have', 'backed', 'corner', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'laughs', 'way', 'be', 'janitor', 'becoming', 'security', 'guard', 'Cox', 'dealing', 'child', 'Turk', 'Carla', 'basically', 'becoming', 'one', 'person', 'funnier', 'Elliot', 'rekindling', 'flame', 'season', 'one', 'Sean', 'JD', 'continued', 'troubles', 'being', 'doctor/lover', 'Everything', 'funny', 'just', 'notch', 'seasons', 'one', 'two.Overall', 'yes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'episode', 'wise', 'extras', 'are', 'amazing', 'always', ""'m"", 'still', 'happy', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'cliffhanger', 'good', 'one', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'even', 'more', 'scenarios', 'continued', 'season', 'four', 'DVD', 'release']",N/A
971499,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000EBGFPY,calvinnme,"[1, 1]","In season three, the show has become very comfortable with itself, sporting its unique brand of comedy that includes sight gags, one-liners, slapstick comedy, and of course J.D.'s daydreams, like a well-known trademark. The entire effort comes together to make it one of the finest comedies on the air today. This year, the show makes more room for subplots that focus on the members of the cast other than J.D. This season, Turk and Carla are planning their wedding, Dr. Cox is trying to figure out if it is love or disdain or a combination of both that he feels for his family, and Elliot has begun to truly grow as a person since her father pulled the monetary rug out from underneath her the previous season. She increasingly stands on her own two feet this season without needing an emotional crutch of any kind.Although dramatic episodes are present in this season, the atmosphere of the show is lighter with more outrageous buffoonery such as the janitor's roof-top toilet that he uses as a thinking cap, if you'll pardon the mixed metaphors. Thus, when you do hit upon a serious dramatic show during this season, it hits hard due to the contrast with what is an overall mischievous mood. For example, in ""My Fifteen Seconds"", whose title comes from the average time that a doctor spends with a patient in a hospital, J.D.and Cox are focused on the medical issue of a young woman who has been poisoned, not really listening to the sad personal details of her life that she has been telling them. They finally give up and say they don't know how it happened, but tell her she will recover. Only as they leave the hospital together does it hit them - the woman has poisoned herself. They then go back in to give her the attention she obviously has been clamoring for.""My Screw Up"" is another serious episode, and one in which you are likely to be totally confused until the end. Jordan's brother Ben - a two year cancer survivor - comes for a visit. On top of being his brother-in-law, Ben is a close friend of Dr. Cox, which is a club with few members. Apparently, an elderly patient that Cox leaves in J.D.'s care unexpectedly goes into cardiac arrest and dies. Inexplicably, Cox rides J.D about this death for the rest of the episode. Then Cox refuses to leave the hospital because ""when he's not here people die"" - apparently referring to J.D.s patient. Only at the end do we discover the meaning behind Cox's strange behavior. This episode features perhaps McGinley's finest performance on Scrubs, and there are many to choose from. Although J.D. plays a minor role in this episode, the way he asks one key question to Cox at the end - ""Where do you think we are?"" is worthy of a supporting role award in itself. This episode just doesn't just break your heart, it rips the still-beating organ from your chest.As with almost all of the ""Spin City"" alumni, Michael J. Fox finally puts in an appearance. But rather than just give him a placeholder role, the writers dare to have Fox's character parallel his own life struggle as he portrays a doctor who is suffering from a chronic condition - obsessive-compulsive disorder - that interferes with his career. Although he is able to upstage Cox at every turn with his knowledge of medicine, the simple act of prepping for surgery is his biggest challenge because he just can't stop washing his hands. Great performance by Fox on playing a role that had to hit close to home on so many levels. This is truly another great and highly recommended season of ""Scrubs"".",5,Scrubs matures as a sitcom yet maintains its high quality,1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,3520,"['season', 'three', 'show', 'become', 'very', 'comfortable', 'sporting', 'unique', 'brand', 'comedy', 'sight', 'gags', 'one-liners', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'course', 'J.D', 'daydreams', 'well-known', 'trademark', 'entire', 'effort', 'together', 'make', 'one', 'finest', 'comedies', 'air', 'today', 'year', 'show', 'more', 'room', 'subplots', 'focus', 'members', 'cast', 'other', 'J.D', 'season', 'Turk', 'Carla', 'are', 'planning', 'wedding', 'Dr.', 'Cox', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'love', 'disdain', 'combination', 'family', 'Elliot', 'begun', 'truly', 'grow', 'person', 'father', 'pulled', 'monetary', 'rug', 'previous', 'season', 'increasingly', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'season', 'needing', 'emotional', 'crutch', 'kind.Although', 'dramatic', 'episodes', 'are', 'present', 'season', 'atmosphere', 'show', 'lighter', 'more', 'outrageous', 'buffoonery', 'such', 'janitor', 'roof-top', 'toilet', 'thinking', 'cap', ""'ll"", 'pardon', 'mixed', 'metaphors', 'Thus', 'when', 'do', 'hit', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'show', 'season', 'hard', 'due', 'contrast', 'what', 'overall', 'mischievous', 'mood', 'example', 'Fifteen', 'Seconds', 'title', 'average', 'time', 'doctor', 'patient', 'hospital', 'J.D.and', 'Cox', 'are', 'focused', 'medical', 'issue', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'poisoned', 'not', 'really', 'listening', 'sad', 'personal', 'details', 'life', 'been', 'telling', 'finally', 'give', 'up', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'happened', 'tell', 'will', 'recover', 'Only', 'leave', 'hospital', 'together', 'hit', 'woman', 'poisoned', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'give', 'attention', 'obviously', 'been', 'clamoring', 'Screw', 'Up', 'serious', 'episode', 'one', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'totally', 'confused', 'end', 'Jordan', 'brother', 'Ben', 'two', 'year', 'cancer', 'survivor', 'visit', 'top', 'being', 'brother-in-law', 'Ben', 'close', 'friend', 'Dr.', 'Cox', 'club', 'few', 'members', 'Apparently', 'elderly', 'patient', 'Cox', 'J.D', 'care', 'unexpectedly', 'cardiac', 'arrest', 'dies', 'Inexplicably', 'Cox', 'J.D', 'death', 'rest', 'episode', 'Then', 'Cox', 'leave', 'hospital', 'when', 'not', 'here', 'people', 'die', 'apparently', 'referring', 'J.D.s', 'patient', 'Only', 'end', 'do', 'discover', 'meaning', 'Cox', 'strange', 'behavior', 'episode', 'perhaps', 'McGinley', 'finest', 'performance', 'Scrubs', 'are', 'many', 'choose', 'J.D', 'minor', 'role', 'episode', 'way', 'one', 'key', 'question', 'Cox', 'end', 'Where', 'do', 'think', 'are', 'worthy', 'supporting', 'role', 'award', 'episode', 'just', ""n't"", 'just', 'break', 'heart', 'still-beating', 'organ', 'chest.As', 'almost', 'Spin', 'City', 'alumni', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'finally', 'appearance', 'rather', 'just', 'give', 'placeholder', 'role', 'writers', 'dare', 'have', 'Fox', 'character', 'parallel', 'own', 'life', 'struggle', 'doctor', 'who', 'suffering', 'chronic', 'condition', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'disorder', 'career', 'able', 'upstage', 'Cox', 'turn', 'knowledge', 'medicine', 'simple', 'act', 'prepping', 'surgery', 'biggest', 'challenge', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'washing', 'hands', 'Great', 'performance', 'Fox', 'playing', 'role', 'had', 'hit', 'close', 'home', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'truly', 'great', 'highly', 'recommended', 'season', 'Scrubs']",N/A

The only disappointment comes feature wise, ironically from the extremely high bar that Scrubs set when setting the higher benchmark which no other TV shows have yet matched by the way, for TV season DVD disc sets with the initial and second series sets.  There are a lot less bonus features in the Third Season DVD set and the director/actor commentaries have disappeared completely, which is a great shame as they were extremely entertaining, informative and a great insight into both the show and the personalities of the Scrubs' actors. Hopefully these will return for the forth season.The 22 episodes that made up the third season are all classics with the return of guest star Brendan Fraser in a Sixth Sense style episode, along with great actors like Michael J Fox making their first guest appearance.  In fact one of the bonus features, Long-Term Residents, talks about how they always wanted Michael J Fox to come on the show but he was never well enough for the first two seasons and that Brendan Fraser wanted to return but be dead.  Other great features include Don't Try This at Home which explains which stunts the actors did and which ones had stunt men/women.  Those wanting a more intimate view into the personalities of their favourite actors will be pleased with What up Dawg? where we get to meet the dogs of each star that they bring to the set each day.

I usually won't buy TV shows on DVD let alone TV shows I have already seen but I was more than willing to buy the third season of Scrubs (I also bought Seasons 1 and 2 and I highly recommend them as well).This show kills me.  If it's not one thing it's another thing that makes me laugh.  What I really like about the show is that for all of it's pratfalls and yes I will use the word...zaniness...it's got a great big heart that you can't help but love.  The show can go (on a dime mind you) from roariously funny to heartbreakingly sincere and you can only conclude that this is due to talented writers and talented actors.  There literally are episodes that by the time you have wiped your tears from laughing, you find that you're tearing up from the show's honest observations of life and the suffering we all must endure to be happy.In this 3rd season, Scrubs takes a little bit of more serious tone and develops most of the characters more but nonetheless still delivers the goods: a lot of laughs and a lot of heart.  This season contains one of the best episodes this sitcom has ever filmed and it's almost worth the price of these DVD's alone.  I also think Sarah Chalke (who plays Elliot Reid) really found her character here in this season.  She is hilarious.But really they all are.  While some characters may be more funny than others, each one of the characters gets a chance to shine at one point or another and each is funny in his or her own right.  The cast is hilarious but they are also quite deft at bringing a lot of sincerity and humanity to the show's wonderful messages.

971511,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000EBGFPY,Kaya Savas,"[4, 4]","REVIEW: Scrubs is one of my favorite shows on television. I knew it was something special from the very first episode. It has a certain charisma that is rarely found in any other television show. Each of the characters are unique with completely different personalities that counter each other to create perfect comedic situations. You have J.D and Dr. Cox, J.D and Janitor, Dr. Cox and Dr. Kelso, Dr. Kelso and Ted, Elliot and Carla, Carla and Dr. Cox, Dr. Cox and Jordan, I mean the list goes on. All these characters balance and counter each other perfectly. They play off each other, and it also helps that the show's writing is absolutely perfect. In my opinion, Season 3 is the best season of the show thus far, though the current season right now is rivaling it. In Season 3 the characters come into full bloom, and the actors are all comfortable playing them. The set comes with all 22 episodes spread on 3 discs. The writing is more involving, you have tons of storylines between each of them. Every episode feels fresh. The reason why Scrubs is so special is that the lessons learned by the characters in the show relate to real life experiences that we all have had. The audience has so much to relate to, and can identify with at least one character if not two. We all know a Dr. Cox in our life, we've all had insecure friends like Elliot. The characters are fleshed out to perfection. The season also had some amazing guest stars. The best being Michael J. Fox's appearance on two episodes in the season, which are two more examples of episodes being emotionally involving. The show is also the only show I know that can switch tone from comedy to drama instantly and still work. I am not ashamed to say that there have been several Scrubs episodes that were so moving that they brought me to tears. Season 3 has one of my favorite episodes of the series, and that is the one guest starring Brendan Fraser. Not only was it laugh out funny, but extremely touching and sad. Scrubs is the best comedy on television right now, and I was appalled at how NBC just shoved it aside this past season. They pulled it from the fall schedule and moved it to be a mid-season filler incase any other new shows failed to make it. Hopefully, in the case that Scrubs doesn't make it with NBC then ABC will take it since it is a Disney show.VIDEO: If you own the first two seasons then you probably know what to expect. Scrubs is one of the few shows that is still shot in the 4:3 aspect ratio and not in high definition or widescreen. The picture is good though, but not as sharp as other shows that are on right now. It's no different than watching when it's on TV.AUDIO: The Season 1 DVD had a 2.0 mix, and they brought 5.1 with the second season. Season 3 has a Dolby Digital 5.1 mix that is greatly appreciated, not so much for the dialogue but for the great music used at the ends of most episodes. Since the show is dialogue based, it doesn't really utilize the surround speakers. However, the 5.1 mix is good for spreading around hospital noises like machines that are whirring, beeps, typing, and all other typical ambient noises.SPECIAL FEATURES: Those who bought the first two seasons know that the Scrubs seasons are plentiful when it comes to entertaining bonus features. Buena Vista as a whole is great when it comes to TV series on DVD. I own the first season of LOST and that too had great bonus features, Scrubs Season 3 is no different. We have a smorgasbord of great featurettes and hilarious deleted scenes and out-takes. The thing is that with every season so far all the bonus features are fresh and original. No repeat of the same kind of featurette over and over through the seasons. On this set you'll find some great stuff behind Elliot and The Todd, and a look at the guest stars of the season. You also have two commentaries, which are pretty fun to listen to.BOTTOM LINE: A great DVD for a great season of a great show. Scrubs remains to be that breath of fresh air that I look forward to every week. Hopefully we will get a few more seasons before the show decides to end, because as of now it show's no signs of running out of steam. Every episode is refreshing and original, chock-full of great dialogue and great acting.",5,"Scrubs, A Show That Is Funny & Emotionally Moving.

Even now, five years later, the storylines are still fresh and original (although some of the slapstick aspects get reduced, reused, and recycled over and over again, like the hospital barbershop quartet). Scrubs is so different than other plastic sitcoms out there with their fake laugh tracks and completely unfunny storylines.

The actors all are completely believable even in the most over-the-top fantasy or pratfall sequence.  The guest stars hit all the right notes, mostly playing themselves, or playing an homage to their characters from TV land. But Michael J Fox and Brendan Fraser, who played recurring characters, were particular standouts this season. At least partly due to their roles, Season Three has more depth and emotion than prior seasons, but never skimps on the comedy.I try to never miss a show, but I still want all the DVD's.  You can watch the shows over and over, and find some new hilarious line in a McGinley monologue, or something previously unnoticed in the background, like Turk being run over in heavy traffic....

My American Girl, (10/2/03)A run-in with her old flame Sean and an accident in her new car leads Elliot to the realization that nothing good has happened to her in the three years that she has been at Sacred Heart. This realization drives her to take drastic measures, including a complete makeover, both inside and out, in an attempt to change her luck. Meanwhile, JD gets stuck with a patient whose diagnosis he can't quite pin down, and when Dr. Cox denies him any assistance, he looks to Carla and Turk to help him out. While Dr. Cox is busy not helping J.D., he takes the time to make amends with Dr. Kelso.48. My Journey (10/10/03)J.D. is feeling left out of his friendship with Turk, and gets hurt when Turk is scared of opening up to him.

My White Whale (10/23/03)Finding difficulties training his interns, J.D. asks to Elliot for some help. She tells J.D about Sean, who gave Elliot great tips based on his dolphin training that fit perfectly for her interns. Dr. Cox finds the ideal pediatrician for his son: Dr. Norris, who acts and looks just like him. However, Dr. Cox is quick to find a problem with him once Jack develops a cough that scares both him and Jordan.50. My Lucky Night (10/30/03)Sean is a bit surprised and disturbed to learn about Elliot and JD's history together, but it turns out his anger is really a cover up for the fact that his six months long trip and he doesn't want Elliot to explode. Dr. Cox. is forced to swallow his pride and actually ask for help when he decides to throw his hat in the ring for the Residency Director position at the hospital. Carla picks up an extra shift as a surgical nurse, which allows her to spend the day working alongside with Turk, to his great annoyance.51. My Brother, Where Art thou? (11/6/03)Dan decides to stay with J.D. for a while after their mom's new fianc&eacute; kicks him out, but after spending some quality time with him at the hospital, Dan isn't sure if he likes the cynical person his little brother has become.

My Advice to you (11/13/03)A chance meeting in the elevator sparks a new friendship between J.D. and the mysterious Danni whose ongoing dialogue about her ex forces J.D. to talk about his feelings for Elliot. Carla's brother Marco comes to visit, but he still hasn't forgiven Turk for mistaking him for a valet at their mother's funeral. Unfortunately, Turk can't even apologize because Marco can't speak anything but Spanish. At the hospital, Dr. Cox relishes his new job promotion but is surprised when J.D. doesn't follow his lead in contradicting Dr. Kelso's orders.53.

My Dirty Secret (12/11/03)Elliot's feeling uncomfortable using clinical terms for her patient's private parts - a result of a repressed childhood and an accidental orgasm she inflicted on a patient during a pelvic exam - so Carla tries to teach her how to say ""vagina"" and ""penis"" without blushing.

My Porcelain God (2/17/04)Elliot finds herself perplexed over a simple procedure that leaves her questioning her career path.

My Moment of Un-Truth (3/30/04)JD must keep a secret when Carla's ""what-if"" guy asks her out on a date. Meanwhile, on the other side of the argument, Carla hounds Turk for checking out other women. Elliot is also on the spot as Dr. Cox and Dr. Kelso both advise her not to give her patient drugs as they suspect he is an addict faking pain.64. His Story II (4/6/04)Turk has to confront a young patient of his when he accidentally cuts a nerve and the boy (who happens to be a concert pianist) loses use of one of his hands.

My Choosiest Choice of All (4/20/04)JD hooks up with Danni again after Sean returns, but he can't forget about his passionate night with Elliot. Meanwhile, Perry realizes he might actually have a crush on the one doctor he loathes.66. My Fault (4/22/04)Elliot asks Sean to move in with her, which only adds to JD's problems. Turk is unsure why Dr. Miller's attitude towards him has changed, until he finds out Carla un-invited her from their wedding. Kelso outrages Dr. Cox when he announces that Sacred Heart will begin doing full body scans, starting with an ever present hypocondriac patient who wants any freebies he can get.67.

971521,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000EBGFPY,Robert Moore,"[10, 12]","Why it is taking so long to bring out this great show on DVD is a mystery to me, but thank god they are finally doing it.  Let's just hope that they don't dawdle on Seasons Four and Five.Although SCRUBS was a quality show from the very beginning, Season Three stands out for the quality both of the individual episodes and the manner in which they developed the various story arcs.  All the nutty and frequently surreal humor is still there and the show doesn't skimp at all on laughs, but it does an increasingly good job of going into issues surrounding understanding the behavior of central characters.  Although the focus on one level is the impending marriage of Turk and Carla, much time is spent on the pathology of JD's relationships, not exclusively but primarily the one between him and Elliot.  The result of this is that all the characters are far less one dimensional and cartoonish than in most comedies.More and more various shows rely on prominent guest stars during sweeps and few shows can top SCRUBS in this regard.  Scott Foley plays Elliot's Season Three boyfriend.  Though he was in an earlier season, we didn't learn then that he is a marine biologist, and their relationship is put on hold for most of the year when he goes to New Zealand for a research project.  Not to be outdone, the show provides for many episodes a girlfriend in the person of the lovely Tara Reid.  Brendan Frasier reprises his role as Jordan's happy-go-lucky brother Ben, while Michael J. Fox has a wonderful appearance as a brilliant doctor/surgeon with severe OCD.  And how about that priest who looks like George Takei, Mr. Sulu from STAR TREK?  Played, of course, by George Takei.And then there is JD and Elliot.  It really is difficult to over praise the job that Zach Braff does in this series.  He has to strike the right balance between being a nerdy loser and puppy dog who dotes on every word and token of praise by his mentor Dr. Cox, while still managing to be convincing as a competent doctor.  Fortunately he almost always hits the right tone.  Sarah Chalke as Elliot is adorable as can be, despite being a complete hottie managing to project a nerdy girl with confidence issues.  In Season Three she decides to become more her own person, and takes on a somewhat aggressive new look, with a hair-do that is just a bit over-the-top, with hair falling over her heavily rouged eyes.  To be honest, it isn't a look that becomes her, but the extremity was intentional, one that she tones down slightly after a run in with Kelso.  Although having a boyfriend (Scott Foley's Sean) keeps her unavailable most of the season, there is still a reprisal of things with JD at the end of the season.  This is, perhaps, the lone false note of the season.  It is a dilemma widely known as the David and Maddie syndrome.  Though MOONLIGHTING had a long tease between the two lead characters that fans adored through the show's first three seasons, once they got together, most of the tension dissipated and the ratings crashed.  Since then, all shows, whether comedies or dramas, have striven to keep potential romantic partners apart than have them get together.  Although JD and Elliot have had several sexual encounters, in the first two seasons they were convinced that although close friends and great sexual partners, they didn't have the right make up to be romantically involved.  The end of Season Three sees JD declaring his love for Elliot, Elliot dumping her boyfriend to be with JD, and then JD instantly losing interest in her romantically as soon as she comes to him.  My own feeling is that they had at this point milked this too often.  I would have liked to see the two be a couple and have Bill Lawrence and his writers work to overcome the curse of David and Maddie.  There are, of course, more seasons to come, but this seemed to me the right place to deal with the issue.Nonetheless, this was a great season indeed.  Everything is clicking from new variations in JD's battle with The Janitor (who he discovers once had a small part in THE FUGITIVE, Neil Flynn, who plays The Janitor, having been in that film as a cop) to a new assertiveness by staff legal advisor Ted to a host of new ways to high-five by the Todd.  The great news is that Seasons Four and Five are also great.  If only they will get around to bringing them out in a timely fashion.  This is a great show, but frankly studios do their shows a disservice by not having all previous seasons out on DVD.  Fans can create new fans by sharing DVDs.  I'm always sharing my copies of ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT and VERONICA MARS and BUFFY and FARSCAPE to people who are about to become of those shows.  Right now it is harder to do that with SCRUBS with so few seasons available.",5,"Finally, Season Three of one of TVs finest shows",1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,4752,"['Why', 'taking', 'so', 'long', 'bring', 'out', 'great', 'show', 'DVD', 'mystery', 'thank', 'god', 'are', 'finally', 'doing', 'Let', 'just', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'dawdle', 'Seasons', 'Four', 'Five.Although', 'SCRUBS', 'was', 'quality', 'show', 'very', 'beginning', 'Season', 'Three', 'out', 'quality', 'individual', 'episodes', 'manner', 'developed', 'various', 'story', 'arcs', 'nutty', 'frequently', 'surreal', 'humor', 'still', 'show', ""n't"", 'skimp', 'laughs', 'increasingly', 'good', 'job', 'going', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'understanding', 'behavior', 'central', 'characters', 'focus', 'one', 'level', 'impending', 'marriage', 'Turk', 'Carla', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'pathology', 'JD', 'relationships', 'not', 'exclusively', 'primarily', 'one', 'Elliot', 'result', 'characters', 'are', 'far', 'less', 'one', 'dimensional', 'cartoonish', 'most', 'comedies.More', 'more', 'various', 'shows', 'rely', 'prominent', 'guest', 'stars', 'sweeps', 'few', 'shows', 'can', 'top', 'SCRUBS', 'regard', 'Scott', 'Foley', 'Elliot', 'Season', 'Three', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'earlier', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'learn', 'then', 'marine', 'biologist', 'relationship', 'put', 'hold', 'most', 'year', 'when', 'New', 'Zealand', 'research', 'project', 'Not', 'be', 'outdone', 'show', 'many', 'episodes', 'girlfriend', 'person', 'lovely', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'Brendan', 'Frasier', 'role', 'Jordan', 'happy-go-lucky', 'brother', 'Ben', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'wonderful', 'appearance', 'brilliant', 'doctor/surgeon', 'severe', 'OCD', 'how', 'priest', 'who', 'George', 'Takei', 'Mr.', 'Sulu', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'Played', 'course', 'George', 'Takei.And', 'then', 'JD', 'Elliot', 'really', 'difficult', 'praise', 'job', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'series', 'strike', 'right', 'balance', 'being', 'nerdy', 'loser', 'puppy', 'dog', 'who', 'word', 'token', 'praise', 'mentor', 'Dr.', 'Cox', 'still', 'managing', 'be', 'convincing', 'competent', 'doctor', 'Fortunately', 'almost', 'always', 'right', 'tone', 'Sarah', 'Chalke', 'Elliot', 'adorable', 'can', 'be', 'being', 'complete', 'hottie', 'managing', 'project', 'nerdy', 'girl', 'confidence', 'issues', 'Season', 'Three', 'become', 'more', 'own', 'person', 'somewhat', 'aggressive', 'new', 'look', 'hair-do', 'just', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'hair', 'falling', 'heavily', 'rouged', 'eyes', 'be', 'honest', ""n't"", 'look', 'extremity', 'was', 'intentional', 'one', 'down', 'slightly', 'run', 'Kelso', 'having', 'boyfriend', 'Scott', 'Foley', 'Sean', 'unavailable', 'most', 'season', 'still', 'reprisal', 'things', 'JD', 'end', 'season', 'perhaps', 'lone', 'false', 'note', 'season', 'dilemma', 'widely', 'known', 'David', 'Maddie', 'syndrome', 'MOONLIGHTING', 'had', 'long', 'tease', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'fans', 'adored', 'show', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'once', 'got', 'together', 'most', 'tension', 'dissipated', 'ratings', 'crashed', 'then', 'shows', 'comedies', 'dramas', 'have', 'striven', 'keep', 'potential', 'romantic', 'partners', 'apart', 'have', 'get', 'together', 'JD', 'Elliot', 'have', 'had', 'several', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'convinced', 'close', 'friends', 'great', 'sexual', 'partners', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'right', 'make', 'up', 'be', 'romantically', 'involved', 'end', 'Season', 'Three', 'JD', 'declaring', 'love', 'Elliot', 'Elliot', 'dumping', 'boyfriend', 'be', 'JD', 'then', 'JD', 'instantly', 'losing', 'interest', 'romantically', 'as', 'soon', 'own', 'feeling', 'had', 'point', 'milked', 'too', 'often', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'two', 'be', 'couple', 'have', 'Bill', 'Lawrence', 'writers', 'work', 'overcome', 'curse', 'David', 'Maddie', 'are', 'course', 'more', 'seasons', 'come', 'seemed', 'right', 'place', 'deal', 'issue.Nonetheless', 'was', 'great', 'season', 'indeed', 'Everything', 'clicking', 'new', 'variations', 'JD', 'battle', 'Janitor', 'who', 'once', 'had', 'small', 'part', 'THE', 'FUGITIVE', 'Neil', 'Flynn', 'who', 'Janitor', 'having', 'been', 'film', 'cop', 'new', 'assertiveness', 'staff', 'legal', 'advisor', 'Ted', 'host', 'new', 'ways', 'high-five', 'Todd', 'great', 'news', 'Seasons', 'Four', 'Five', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'only', 'will', 'get', 'bringing', 'out', 'timely', 'fashion', 'great', 'show', 'frankly', 'studios', 'do', 'shows', 'disservice', 'not', 'having', 'previous', 'seasons', 'out', 'DVD', 'Fans', 'can', 'create', 'new', 'fans', 'sharing', 'DVDs', ""'m"", 'always', 'sharing', 'copies', 'ARRESTED', 'DEVELOPMENT', 'VERONICA', 'MARS', 'BUFFY', 'FARSCAPE', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'become', 'shows', 'Right', 'now', 'harder', 'do', 'SCRUBS', 'so', 'few', 'seasons', 'available']",N/A
