1158138,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B0017XAD5Q,Artist & Author,"[3, 5]","To appreciate this movie, one has to have a fairly good working knowledge of how the human mind works.  Nearly the whole movie is narrated by the 'Dungeon Girl' because the real story doesn't take place at a remote farm, but in her mind.  Many reviewers have failed to realize that this is really a story about the psychology of why a young girl, kidnapped and held by a mysterious man, would stay with him for so long when she seemed to have ample opportunity to escape.  In a nutshell, she was a girl from a family where she was more of an inconvenience or bother than a loved member of the family.  So, when she is kidnapped, she senses that this is a man who wants her for herself - he doesn't touch her sexually - and for the first time in her life she felt appreciated, if not loved.My one complaint about the movie, moving it down one star, is that we are not made privy to the kidnapper psychological motive for kidnapping the girl.  He probably felt inadequate with adult women, in a sense still being a psychologically a young boy.  It is very difficult to depict the human mind in a visual medium like a movie, but the director does a very good job of it by using various movie techniques that many might find unusual.  If you don't understand the human mind, this movie might be over your head.  If you do, it is a great chance to put what you think you know to use trying to make sense of the story.",4,A Very Psychological Movie,1226966400,"11 18, 2008",2008,1412,"['appreciate', 'movie', 'one', 'have', 'fairly', 'good', 'working', 'knowledge', 'how', 'human', 'mind', 'works', 'Nearly', 'whole', 'movie', 'narrated', ""'Dungeon"", 'Girl', 'real', 'story', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'remote', 'farm', 'mind', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'failed', 'realize', 'really', 'story', 'psychology', 'why', 'young', 'girl', 'kidnapped', 'held', 'mysterious', 'man', 'would', 'stay', 'so', 'long', 'when', 'seemed', 'have', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'escape', 'nutshell', 'was', 'girl', 'family', 'where', 'was', 'more', 'inconvenience', 'bother', 'loved', 'member', 'family', 'So', 'when', 'kidnapped', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'touch', 'sexually', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'felt', 'appreciated', 'not', 'loved.My', 'one', 'complaint', 'movie', 'moving', 'down', 'one', 'star', 'are', 'not', 'made', 'privy', 'kidnapper', 'psychological', 'motive', 'kidnapping', 'girl', 'probably', 'felt', 'inadequate', 'adult', 'women', 'sense', 'still', 'being', 'psychologically', 'young', 'boy', 'very', 'difficult', 'depict', 'human', 'mind', 'visual', 'medium', 'movie', 'director', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'using', 'various', 'movie', 'techniques', 'many', 'might', 'find', 'unusual', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'human', 'mind', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'head', 'do', 'great', 'chance', 'put', 'what', 'think', 'know', 'use', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'story']",Dungeon Girl

He seemed to be obsessed with witches, I don't know if it was a metaphor for a woman's power over men in general or him in particular.

It was theStockholm Syndrome of course but the way the two main characters justoften engaged in a staring match was curiously effective (unless youhave the attention span of a gnat) if you paid attention. Theentire relationship between the captor and captive was fascinating. Itdid not follow type. It presented complex characters.The most salient point is that the man does NOT rape the girl.
