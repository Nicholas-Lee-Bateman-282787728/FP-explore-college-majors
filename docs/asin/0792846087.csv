155022,AQUU8S55JGY2H,0792846087,Aco,"[2, 2]","Haunting, bleak, somber, grey, tragic, morose, repressed. All these describe Interiors. And this Woody Allen made right after Annie Hall! The story, expanded upon throughout the rest of these reviews, is about a family struggling with each other after the matriarch has a nervous breakdown. The children, three sisters (echoing ""Cries and Whispers"" and Chekov?), their significant others, and their father all debate what of their lives and history and mother and each other. Interiors is a moving film, not funny, not even light, save for Maureen Stapleton, the only character with any positive energy, whose vitality is echoed in her red, pink and kalidescopic clothing. But Interiors is a great examination and an up-close creation of a family's struggles within itself and how each individuals issues shapes the family. The set designs, in very muted tones, the clothing, the lack of music, the darkness, and the harsh and gorgeous beach photography all enhance the story.The DVD has no features, except the usual language modifications, wide-screen/standard option and trailer.Recommended for those interested in Allen's darker side and/or Ingmar Bergman-like/Scandanavian aesthetic.",4,Another side from Allen,1102291200,"12 6, 2004",2004,1188,"['Haunting', 'bleak', 'somber', 'grey', 'tragic', 'morose', 'repressed', 'describe', 'Interiors', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'made', 'right', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'story', 'expanded', 'rest', 'reviews', 'family', 'struggling', 'other', 'matriarch', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'children', 'three', 'sisters', 'echoing', 'Cries', 'Whispers', 'Chekov', 'significant', 'others', 'father', 'debate', 'what', 'lives', 'history', 'mother', 'other', 'Interiors', 'moving', 'film', 'not', 'funny', 'not', 'even', 'light', 'save', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'only', 'character', 'positive', 'energy', 'vitality', 'echoed', 'red', 'pink', 'kalidescopic', 'clothing', 'Interiors', 'great', 'examination', 'up-close', 'creation', 'family', 'struggles', 'how', 'individuals', 'issues', 'shapes', 'family', 'set', 'designs', 'very', 'muted', 'tones', 'clothing', 'lack', 'music', 'darkness', 'harsh', 'gorgeous', 'beach', 'photography', 'enhance', 'story.The', 'DVD', 'features', 'usual', 'language', 'modifications', 'wide-screen/standard', 'option', 'trailer.Recommended', 'interested', 'Allen', 'darker', 'side', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman-like/Scandanavian', 'aesthetic']",N/A
155023,A23L2BR07AOBG1,0792846087,alex bushman,"[4, 4]","Who knows what this film is truly trying to communicate universally, but what it showed to me was it's feelings about multiple perspectives and how some people remember how things were because of something that was said, or happened, and another feels a certain way because of how things currently are.This film also makes a sad statement about psychaitry, I feel, in it's relation to humanity. The family is irreparably damaged because they way they communicate to one another has become cold, detached, and impersonal in the worst ways. Everyone needs someone to talk to when they need to sort something out mentally and part of the reason these people are messed up is they have no one to talk to except the shrinks, or they simply hold it inside, and I'm not sure which one is better: to have your truth told to you and it possibly being false, or to deny the feelings that are dying to get out. People become damaged when they don't know how to constructively understand what is going on and most times all they need is someone to talk to in order to become illuminated about what's going on, or the conversation puts them in a state to understand things honestly. That anyone has to pay someone to listen to them sort out their problems  and/or come up with a hypothesis is pathetic. This should be a free service that is compassionately given amongst friends and family and if everyone got that the topic of this movie wouldn't exist.This movie is devastating for its quiet ambience and frail, brilliant, performances.  My evening was darkly settled as the credits rolled by without the music I had become accustomed to in other Allen films.  I was surprised by the overall downbeat nature of this film, but I got the idea of what it was right at the beginning.  Having seen some of his half-serious films made me wonder what a completely serious film by him would be like and with this film, I have my answer.  In some ways, I think Woody Allen understands drama better than most directors alive today and that's because he has such a deep understanding of comedy.  The story is bleak, but it definitely sparked a deep conversation afterward.  I love that he made this film, I just don't love it, but I highly respect it and regard it as one of his best and most important films within his body of work.",5,Such an engaging film about mental instability,1186444800,"08 7, 2007",2007,2311,"['Who', 'what', 'film', 'truly', 'trying', 'communicate', 'universally', 'what', 'showed', 'was', 'feelings', 'multiple', 'perspectives', 'how', 'people', 'remember', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'something', 'was', 'said', 'happened', 'feels', 'certain', 'way', 'how', 'things', 'currently', 'are.This', 'film', 'also', 'sad', 'statement', 'psychaitry', 'feel', 'relation', 'humanity', 'family', 'irreparably', 'damaged', 'way', 'communicate', 'one', 'become', 'cold', 'detached', 'impersonal', 'worst', 'ways', 'Everyone', 'someone', 'talk', 'when', 'need', 'sort', 'something', 'mentally', 'part', 'reason', 'people', 'are', 'messed', 'up', 'have', 'one', 'talk', 'shrinks', 'simply', 'hold', 'inside', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'one', 'better', 'have', 'truth', 'told', 'possibly', 'being', 'false', 'deny', 'feelings', 'are', 'dying', 'get', 'out', 'People', 'become', 'damaged', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'constructively', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'most', 'times', 'need', 'someone', 'talk', 'order', 'become', 'illuminated', 'what', 'going', 'conversation', 'state', 'understand', 'things', 'honestly', 'anyone', 'pay', 'someone', 'listen', 'sort', 'out', 'problems', 'and/or', 'come', 'up', 'hypothesis', 'pathetic', 'should', 'be', 'free', 'service', 'compassionately', 'given', 'amongst', 'friends', 'family', 'everyone', 'got', 'topic', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'exist.This', 'movie', 'devastating', 'quiet', 'ambience', 'frail', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'evening', 'was', 'darkly', 'settled', 'credits', 'rolled', 'music', 'had', 'become', 'accustomed', 'other', 'Allen', 'films', 'was', 'surprised', 'overall', 'downbeat', 'nature', 'film', 'got', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'right', 'beginning', 'Having', 'seen', 'half-serious', 'films', 'made', 'wonder', 'what', 'completely', 'serious', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'have', 'answer', 'ways', 'think', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'drama', 'better', 'most', 'directors', 'alive', 'today', 'deep', 'understanding', 'comedy', 'story', 'bleak', 'definitely', 'sparked', 'deep', 'conversation', 'afterward', 'love', 'made', 'film', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'highly', 'respect', 'regard', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'important', 'films', 'body', 'work']",N/A
155024,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,0792846087,Alex Udvary,"[8, 9]","Woody Allen's follow up to his Academy Award winning film &quot;Annie Hall&quot; was his first drama, and a real disappointment when first released. But, dispite the unwarm reception it received from the American public &quot;Interiors&quot; went on to earn several Academy Award nominataions including; &quot;Best Director&quot;, &quot;Best Screenplay&quot;, and &quot;Best Actress&quot; (Geraldine Page). I avoided watching this film due to awful word-of mouth. The funny thing is I own a copy of this film for 4 years and never was once tempted to watch it, that is untill a few days ago. &quot;Interiors&quot; I now feel is a true masterpiece, but, of course it has it's share of faults, which I will get to later.The main reason I enjoy this story, which is mainly about a family crumbling, is because I can connect with the characters. I love movies about hard, grim subjects, especially ones that deal with families, as you can tell I'm just a load of laughs to be around lol. Allen managed to create some very interresting characters. I really loved watching Mary Beth Hurt, who plays I believe the middle child of three sisters, Joey. Joey, as Renata (Diane Keaton) puts it, has all the personal problems of an artist, but, none of the talent. Joey yearns to be able to express the feelings she has inside, but doesn't know how to express them. She is one of the most interesting characters I've seen in a while. You can't help but feel for her. I enjoyed the little bit we see of Flyn, the youngest sister played by Kristen Griffith, she is what I would call the &quot;black sheep&quot; of the family. She's a daytime soap opera actress, who gets mixed up with drugs and drinking. She also seems &quot;lost&quot; and it looks as if she will never find her direction. I just wish Allen would of find some way to make her a stronger character. I kept wanting to know more about her. Finally, of course when you have a talent like E.G. Marshall in a movie, you can expect him to bring something special with him. His just perfect as Arthur, the husband and father who is going through a mild depression.Now the faults. The dialogue seems stiff. No one in this movie talks the way &quot;real&quot; people talk. I didn't like Diane Keaton in this movie very much. I think it's the worst character Allen has ever written for her, and I say this because, I didn't find her to be likeable. When we think back to movies like &quot;Sleeper&quot;, &quot;Manhattan&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Annie Hall&quot; she was always likeable in them. I found her character to be rather bland. But, I must admit, she does have one great scene where she and her husband, Frederick (Richard Jordon) get into an agrument. That scene is just full of emotion. It reminds me of Ingmar Bergman's &quot;Scenes From A Marriage&quot;. It reaches that same level of intensity. The character Mike, played by Sam Waterson is rather bland as well. There was nothing really there for him. But, don't worry Allen would later give him a much better role in &quot;Crime and Misdemeanors&quot; as a blind rabbi. Maureen Stapleton seems like she's having fun with her role, and she does a fine job, only problem, again, Allen didn't give her a big enough part. By the time she enters the movie, you have about 30-40 minutes till the film ends. Woody has been quoted saying, if he could remake this film he would have introduced her much earlier into the film. For those who don't like Allen's &quot;European&quot; films, stay far away. As I was watching this film I could almost picture the characters dialogue appearing as subtitles. Everyone is under the impression that this film is Allen's answer to Bergman's &quot;Autumn Sonta&quot;, well you couldn't be more wrong. True, both films were released in the same year. If you want to see Allen's version of &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; watch &quot;September&quot;, but beware. As &quot;September&quot; is a much weaker film than this. Infact I consider it to be Allen's worst. There is one scene I feel I have to mention before ending my review. There's a scene where Joey (Mary Beth Hurt) finds out she's going to have a baby. She doesn't want a child right now, but Mike (Sam Waterson) thinks it might be a good idea for them to have a baby and get married. In the next scene, Joey wakes up before Mike and just starts to watch him sleep. She then leans over and starts to wake him up with her kisses, it's the most touching scene in this entire film. Which is really a &quot;cold&quot; film that shows no passion at all. This marked a wonderful try to do a straight drama by Allen, I really enjoyed this film. And I hope others will too!",4,The &quot;Interiors&quot; of lost souls,1001894400,"10 1, 2001",2001,4654,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'follow', 'up', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'film', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'was', 'first', 'drama', 'real', 'disappointment', 'when', 'first', 'released', 'dispite', 'unwarm', 'reception', 'received', 'American', 'public', 'quot', 'Interiors', 'quot', 'went', 'earn', 'several', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominataions', 'including', 'quot', 'Best', 'Director', 'quot', 'quot', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'quot', 'quot', 'Best', 'Actress', 'quot', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'avoided', 'watching', 'film', 'due', 'awful', 'word-of', 'mouth', 'funny', 'thing', 'own', 'copy', 'film', '4', 'years', 'never', 'was', 'once', 'tempted', 'watch', 'untill', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'quot', 'Interiors', 'quot', 'now', 'feel', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'course', 'share', 'faults', 'will', 'get', 'later.The', 'main', 'reason', 'enjoy', 'story', 'mainly', 'family', 'crumbling', 'can', 'connect', 'characters', 'love', 'movies', 'hard', 'grim', 'subjects', 'especially', 'ones', 'deal', 'families', 'can', 'tell', ""'m"", 'just', 'load', 'laughs', 'be', 'lol', 'Allen', 'managed', 'create', 'very', 'interresting', 'characters', 'really', 'loved', 'watching', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'Hurt', 'who', 'believe', 'middle', 'child', 'three', 'sisters', 'Joey', 'Joey', 'Renata', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'personal', 'problems', 'artist', 'none', 'talent', 'Joey', 'be', 'able', 'express', 'feelings', 'inside', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'express', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'enjoyed', 'little', 'bit', 'see', 'Flyn', 'youngest', 'sister', 'played', 'Kristen', 'Griffith', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'quot', 'black', 'sheep', 'quot', 'family', 'daytime', 'soap', 'opera', 'actress', 'who', 'mixed', 'up', 'drugs', 'drinking', 'also', 'quot', 'lost', 'quot', 'will', 'never', 'find', 'direction', 'just', 'wish', 'Allen', 'would', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'stronger', 'character', 'kept', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'Finally', 'course', 'when', 'have', 'talent', 'E.G', 'Marshall', 'movie', 'can', 'expect', 'bring', 'something', 'special', 'just', 'perfect', 'Arthur', 'husband', 'father', 'who', 'going', 'mild', 'faults', 'dialogue', 'stiff', 'one', 'movie', 'way', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'people', 'talk', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'think', 'worst', 'character', 'Allen', 'ever', 'written', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'likeable', 'When', 'think', 'back', 'movies', 'quot', 'Sleeper', 'quot', 'quot', 'Manhattan', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'was', 'always', 'likeable', 'found', 'character', 'be', 'rather', 'bland', 'must', 'admit', 'have', 'one', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'husband', 'Frederick', 'Richard', 'Jordon', 'get', 'agrument', 'scene', 'just', 'full', 'emotion', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'quot', 'Scenes', 'A', 'Marriage', 'quot', 'same', 'level', 'intensity', 'character', 'Mike', 'played', 'Sam', 'Waterson', 'rather', 'bland', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'nothing', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'Allen', 'would', 'later', 'give', 'much', 'better', 'role', 'quot', 'Crime', 'Misdemeanors', 'quot', 'blind', 'rabbi', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'having', 'fun', 'role', 'fine', 'job', 'only', 'problem', 'again', 'Allen', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'big', 'enough', 'part', 'time', 'movie', 'have', '30-40', 'minutes', 'film', 'Woody', 'been', 'quoted', 'saying', 'could', 'remake', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'introduced', 'much', 'earlier', 'film', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Allen', 'quot', 'European', 'quot', 'films', 'stay', 'far', 'away', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'could', 'almost', 'picture', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'appearing', 'subtitles', 'Everyone', 'impression', 'film', 'Allen', 'answer', 'Bergman', 'quot', 'Autumn', 'Sonta', 'quot', 'well', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'wrong', 'True', 'films', 'were', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'want', 'see', 'Allen', 'version', 'quot', 'Autumn', 'Sonata', 'quot', 'watch', 'quot', 'September', 'quot', 'beware', 'quot', 'September', 'quot', 'much', 'weaker', 'film', 'Infact', 'consider', 'be', 'Allen', 'worst', 'one', 'scene', 'feel', 'have', 'mention', 'ending', 'review', 'scene', 'where', 'Joey', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'Hurt', 'out', 'going', 'have', 'baby', ""n't"", 'want', 'child', 'right', 'now', 'Mike', 'Sam', 'Waterson', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'have', 'baby', 'get', 'married', 'next', 'scene', 'Joey', 'up', 'Mike', 'just', 'starts', 'watch', 'sleep', 'then', 'starts', 'wake', 'up', 'kisses', 'most', 'touching', 'scene', 'entire', 'film', 'Which', 'really', 'quot', 'cold', 'quot', 'film', 'passion', 'marked', 'wonderful', 'try', 'do', 'straight', 'drama', 'Allen', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'hope', 'others', 'will', 'too']",N/A

155026,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792846087,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","With hushed tones and pale pallets, `Interiors' is not your average Woody Allen film.  It is not an uproarious comedy or a humorous social commentary.  It is far from a satire and it doesn't star the director.  He isn't even in a single scene.  That said, this is certainly one of Allen's best films, a complete homage to his inspiration and directorial idol, Swedish born Ingmar Bergman.If you are familiar with Bergman's work, you will see his influence heavy on this film.The film centers around a family that is thrown into disarray when they are forced to take sides.  Arthur, the patriarch, decides that, now that his children are grown and out of the house, he is going to separate from his wife, Eve.  His daughters, notably Joey and Renata, are instantly affected.  Eve is not an easy woman to get along with, but she is their mother and they love her and want her happiness, and her loneliness is killing them.  Arthur flourishes, even going as far as to take up with a vivacious woman named Pearl.  Still, the split has done its damage, and each new development continues to eat away at this family in surprising ways.For me, `Interiors' is a film about embracing life.  I hate to make film comparisons, but one thing that struck me strongly was the use of color here.  It reminded me of `Pleasantville'.  The reason being that, in that said film, color was used to express someone finally connecting with their human emotions, breaking away from conformed society and being themselves.  In `Interiors', color is used sparsely.  Everyone dresses in muted tones, the walls are barren and simple and any decoration is earthy and plain.  In the opening sequence Eve gushes all over a simple, plain, earthy colored vase that she sees as something spectacular.  For me, this lack of color represented the family's lack of emotional growth.  Everyone within the family was haunted by their own family problems and emotionally stunted interactions that they repelled more than embraced their life.  The character of Pearl sticks out like a sore thumb, not only because she is so different, but because she corrupts the stagnant beauty of every scene with her smudge of color, whether it be a bright red dress or a sheer pink nightgown.  She represents a woman who knows herself and who isn't afraid to live her life.  She isn't hiding behind her talent or her knowledge or her opinions.  She isn't sheltered because of her issues with family.  She doesn't try to vie for attention she doesn't feel she receives enough.  She isn't trying to find herself amidst expectations that are far too high.She loves herself and those around her and it bleeds all over the pale interiors of this dysfunctional family's lives.With dramatic tension bursting at every seam, this film needed a strong cast to carry it to the next level.  From Mary Beth Hurt and Diane Keaton to E.G. Marshall and Geraldine Page to the luminous Maureen Stapleton, this cast is fantastic.  One of the best ensembles of the 70's and certainly one of the best ensembles in any Woody Allen film, and that's saying a lot since his films often contain stellar acting ensembles.  Diane Keaton and Maureen Stapleton definatily take top honors for me.  If Keaton hadn't won the year before (for `Annie Hall') I'm almost positive she would have been nominated for, and won for this performance.  Maureen Stapleton was nominated (she lost, sadly) and she is probably my favorite performance in the film.  Her vivacious personality is on full display, and the way she fearlessly battles wits with a family who deems her unworthy is stunning.  Her delightful presence is haunted by her newfound family, and the way she allows their words to subtly hurt her (the dancing scene) is just so moving.If you have not seen this film yet are a huge fan of Woody's comedies, I warn you that this is not typical Woody.  If you are a fan of cinema at its finest, darkly moving and poignant and artistic, then I strongly recommend this film.  Some have balked him, saying that this is far too influenced by Bergman.  I don't fault him his inspirations.  Bergman was a masterful director, and he has directed some of the best films of all time.  Woody Allen certainly has his own distinct voice, and he has directed some of the best films of all time.`Interiors' should make them BOTH proud.",5,A different side to an artistic genius...,1269820800,"03 29, 2010",2010,4335,"['hushed', 'tones', 'pale', 'pallets', 'Interiors', 'not', 'average', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'not', 'uproarious', 'comedy', 'humorous', 'social', 'commentary', 'far', 'satire', ""n't"", 'star', 'director', ""n't"", 'even', 'single', 'scene', 'said', 'certainly', 'one', 'Allen', 'best', 'films', 'complete', 'homage', 'inspiration', 'directorial', 'idol', 'Swedish', 'born', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman.If', 'are', 'familiar', 'Bergman', 'work', 'will', 'see', 'influence', 'heavy', 'film.The', 'film', 'centers', 'family', 'thrown', 'disarray', 'when', 'are', 'forced', 'take', 'sides', 'Arthur', 'patriarch', 'now', 'children', 'are', 'grown', 'house', 'going', 'separate', 'wife', 'Eve', 'daughters', 'notably', 'Joey', 'Renata', 'are', 'instantly', 'affected', 'Eve', 'not', 'easy', 'woman', 'get', 'mother', 'love', 'want', 'happiness', 'loneliness', 'killing', 'Arthur', 'flourishes', 'even', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'take', 'up', 'vivacious', 'woman', 'named', 'Pearl', 'Still', 'split', 'done', 'damage', 'new', 'development', 'eat', 'away', 'family', 'surprising', 'ways.For', 'Interiors', 'film', 'embracing', 'life', 'hate', 'make', 'film', 'comparisons', 'one', 'thing', 'struck', 'strongly', 'was', 'use', 'color', 'here', 'reminded', 'Pleasantville', 'reason', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'color', 'was', 'used', 'express', 'someone', 'finally', 'connecting', 'human', 'emotions', 'breaking', 'away', 'conformed', 'society', 'being', 'Interiors', 'color', 'used', 'sparsely', 'Everyone', 'muted', 'tones', 'walls', 'are', 'barren', 'simple', 'decoration', 'earthy', 'plain', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Eve', 'simple', 'plain', 'earthy', 'colored', 'vase', 'something', 'spectacular', 'lack', 'color', 'represented', 'family', 'lack', 'emotional', 'growth', 'Everyone', 'family', 'was', 'haunted', 'own', 'family', 'problems', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'interactions', 'repelled', 'more', 'embraced', 'life', 'character', 'Pearl', 'sticks', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'not', 'only', 'so', 'different', 'stagnant', 'beauty', 'scene', 'smudge', 'color', 'be', 'bright', 'red', 'dress', 'sheer', 'pink', 'nightgown', 'woman', 'who', 'who', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'live', 'life', ""n't"", 'hiding', 'talent', 'knowledge', 'opinions', ""n't"", 'sheltered', 'issues', 'family', ""n't"", 'try', 'vie', 'attention', ""n't"", 'feel', 'enough', ""n't"", 'trying', 'find', 'amidst', 'expectations', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'high.She', 'pale', 'interiors', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'lives.With', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'bursting', 'seam', 'film', 'needed', 'strong', 'cast', 'carry', 'next', 'level', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'Hurt', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'E.G', 'Marshall', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'luminous', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'One', 'best', 'ensembles', '70', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'ensembles', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'saying', 'lot', 'films', 'often', 'contain', 'stellar', 'acting', 'ensembles', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'definatily', 'take', 'top', 'honors', 'Keaton', 'had', ""n't"", 'won', 'year', 'Annie', 'Hall', ""'m"", 'almost', 'positive', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'won', 'performance', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'was', 'nominated', 'lost', 'sadly', 'probably', 'favorite', 'performance', 'film', 'vivacious', 'personality', 'full', 'display', 'way', 'fearlessly', 'wits', 'family', 'who', 'unworthy', 'stunning', 'delightful', 'presence', 'haunted', 'newfound', 'family', 'way', 'words', 'subtly', 'hurt', 'dancing', 'scene', 'just', 'so', 'moving.If', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'yet', 'are', 'huge', 'fan', 'Woody', 'comedies', 'warn', 'not', 'typical', 'Woody', 'are', 'fan', 'cinema', 'finest', 'darkly', 'moving', 'poignant', 'artistic', 'then', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'film', 'have', 'balked', 'saying', 'far', 'too', 'influenced', 'Bergman', 'do', ""n't"", 'fault', 'inspirations', 'Bergman', 'was', 'masterful', 'director', 'directed', 'best', 'films', 'time', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'certainly', 'own', 'distinct', 'voice', 'directed', 'best', 'films', 'time.', 'Interiors', 'should', 'make', 'proud']",N/A

It certainly gave rise to the entire popular and critical hubbub about preferring his earlier, `funny' movies; an attitude Allen parodies himself in `Stardust Memories'.In spite of the fact that I can detect not one hint of a joke in `Interiors', this does not mean Allen has abandoned his core subjects of sex, death, creative freeze-up, parents, and relationships between partners. Diane Keaton, for example, plays a character almost identical to her role in `Manhattan', a New York literary figure. In `Manhattan', she is a successful book editor. In `Interiors', she is a successful poet married to a less successful novelist and teacher, very similar to the character played by Michael Murphy in `Manhattan', to whom she plays mistress. One of the many little subplots which spills over into sexual misdirection is Keaton's husband, played by Richard Jordan, virtually raping Keaton's actress sister, played by Kristin Griffith.The story is incredibly spare. Aside from two suicides and the rape, practically nothing happens other than dialogue. Unlike so many of Allen's other movies, even the location is anonymous. While a keen eye will spot some unobvious New York City scenes and the suburban locations are not hard to assume to be Long Island, `New York' manages to stay out of this movie as a character. The very spare set decoration is an essential part of this story, as part of the sense of the title, `Interiors', comes from the occupation of the central character played by Geraldine Page, whose role is the mother of three daughters (Keaton, Hurt, Griffith) and the wife of a lawyer played by E.G. Marshall. Marshall's character creates the basic situation driving the movie when he announces he has decided he needs to live alone, apart from his wife.Of course, the movie would be incredibly shallow if the whole story was about living in bare white Manhattan co-ops and equally spare Long Island beach houses. The relations between the eight star roles are certainly enough to spin all sorts of symbolism meaning this, that, but I will try to keep speculation to a minimum.While the parents separation and Page's suicides are the external forces driving the story, the `interiors' story seems to be the fact that with the possible exception of Maureen Stapleton, Marshall's post-separation girlfriend, not one of the characters interact with any of their family members with any empathy or feeling until the suicides precipitate an external need for action. Stapleton's difference from the other characters stands out in that she is the only lead character who is not part of this family of highly disconnected people.I am hard pressed to think of any playwright or filmmaker with whom to compare this work. It is totally free of the kind of energy common to most American filmmakers, who, except for my other hero director, Stanley Kubrick, seem to be uncomfortable if more than ten seconds goes by without strong words or action showing up on the screen. It is also totally free of the kind of obvious imagery we see from Bergman or Fellini. We may not know to what they are alluding, but we are darn sure they have hidden a message somewhere in those wild strawberries or that giant fish. The closest I can come may be some of the plays of Eugene O'Neill and Tennessee Williams. I am less familiar with Ibsen, but I suspect there may be some influence from that quarter as well.If for no other reason, this movie is a delight to see the workings of such a great ensemble cast perform together. This is by far the youngest appearance I recall seeing of Sam Waterston and we probably see far too little of Marshall, Stapleton, Page, and Keaton in really serious work.Other reviewers have amply commented on the great skill and beauty of the cinematography. I will interject a small concern that some of the scenes were a bit too dark, not that anything but the dialogue was very important in most scenes.This is a very hard movie to recommend. While Allen has done other movies with very serious themes such as `The Purple Rose of Cairo', `Crimes and Misdemeanors', `September' and `Husbands and Wives', this movie is about as far from his center of gravity based on humor as you can possibly imagine. Therefore, if you are simply amused by his movies, you may want to take a pass on `Interiors'. On the other hand, if you like the way Allen treats his core subjects, you should really see this movie at least once. For died in the wool Allen fans, you probably need to watch it about once every two years to see what new insights it gives on Allen's art.",5,Important Landmark in Allen's Body of

This is all brought to a head when the father (E.G.

155030,A3J2CGLKCCPSBE,0792846087,Bragan Thomas,"[5, 9]","Woody Allen's &quot;Bergman&quot; film, INTERIORS is, to say the least, a peculiar viewing experience.  It is a deeply-felt, superbly-acted film which nearly collapses under the weight of its own pretensions, saved only by the astonishing performances and brilliant photography.  The plot revolves around three daughters, Renanta, Joey and Flyn, and their relationship to their mother, Eve.  Eve is a highly-strung woman whose life is destroyed when her husband (E.G. Marshall) blithely throws her away after decades of marriage.  Eve, whose perfectionism is ultimately blamed for everyone else's problems, is a materialistic decorator who uses objects as talismans to secure her grip on a world which grows increasingly hostile to her as the film progresses.  Eve is seen as &quot;perfect&quot; by her family, but it is this delusion on the part of those around her that destroys her.  Eve is treated by everyone around her as an object that nobody wants, an image impossible to live up to.  Wrapped up in their own competitiveness and selfish concerns, her daughters pay little attention to her cries for help, and barely seem to see her as a real person.  Indeed, Eve is finally driven to suicide not only by her ex-husband's remarriage, but by the hostility of her middle daughter, Joey, who (in a devastating monologue) reveals that she has hated her for years.  Neither Joey nor Renata - both domineering, unstable and emotionally cold - realize just how much they resemble Eve, and it seems that their own marriages are in trouble for similar reasons.  The main character of the film is really Joey, a brilliant but frustrated woman who feels trapped between her &quot;perfect&quot; mother and her sisters, one talented (Renata), and the other beautiful (Flyn), and who would like to be an artist but doesn't have the talent.  Joey is also Daddy's favorite daughter, which causes still further resentment between her and Renata (the youngest daughter, free-spirited and coke-snorting, hardly appears in the film, and when she does it is obviously meant to contrast the vapidity of the &quot;L.A.&quot; lifestyle to the &quot;seriousness&quot; of the east coast).  This fragile network of relationships comes apart on one fateful night in East Hampton, when Daddy marries Pearl, a none-too-bright, rather vulgar Jewish widow at the family house.  A fight breaks out at the reception, and everyone proceeds to get very drunk.  Renata's husband nearly rapes Flyn, and Eve crashes the party only to be mocked and vilified by her own child.  Eve kills herself by walking into the Atlantic Ocean just outside.  Joey nearly dies trying to save her, but is pulled from the water and resuscitated by Pearl, whom she had insulted earlier in the evening.  This sequence is AWESOME.  Exquisitely shot and edited (at the moment Eve dies, Renata and Flyn open their eyes from a sound sleep), the only sound is the unending BOOM of the waves against the shore.  In this one scene, the film works as the deep &quot;cinematic art&quot; that Allen was trying so hard to create.  Everything that INTERIORS does well is summed up in this moment.  That said, the film is at times unbearably pretentious (Best Unintentionally Funny Line: Joey about Pearl: &quot;She's a VULGARIAN!&quot; - Oh my!!) and emotionally one-sided: these people seem not to have had a single happy moment in their lives, despite their fashionable wardrobes, successful careers, and expensive Manhattan and Long Island real estate.  I'm sure the whole thing is supposed to be a dissection of the emotional underpinnings of WASP-culture, but scene after scene is so overwritten that the whole thing becomes unbelievably ponderous.  Maureen Stapleton livens things up a bit and the vibrant-but-dumb Pearl, but even her character (a trashy yenta) is a cliche (Pearl wears bright red all the time and talks about food a lot - WOW, she must be the symbol of Jewish vitality versus WASP restraint - what an original idea, Woody!).  The film also has a certain high-70's &quot;Me-decade&quot; quality, (as evinced by such lines as &quot;I'm sick of your needs and insecurities!  I have my own problems!&quot;) which again pushes it towards the unintentionally comical.  Still, the graceful, intense acting saves the whole thing.  Despite its pretensions (the last shot defines the term, &quot;arty&quot;) and self-consciousness, INTERIORS still packs an emotional punch if you happen to be an East Coast intellectual type.  If you aren't, much of the dialogue will leave you stranded.  See this film for the performances and the often-exquisite compositions.  Whatever else it may be, INTERIORS is unique within the American cinema, an experiment that hasn't been repeated.",4,A Harrowing Study of &quot;Family Values!&quot;,986688000,"04 8, 2001",2001,4726,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'quot', 'Bergman', 'quot', 'film', 'INTERIORS', 'say', 'least', 'peculiar', 'viewing', 'experience', 'deeply-felt', 'superbly-acted', 'film', 'nearly', 'weight', 'own', 'pretensions', 'saved', 'only', 'astonishing', 'performances', 'brilliant', 'photography', 'plot', 'around', 'three', 'daughters', 'Renanta', 'Joey', 'Flyn', 'relationship', 'mother', 'Eve', 'Eve', 'highly-strung', 'woman', 'life', 'destroyed', 'when', 'husband', 'E.G', 'Marshall', 'blithely', 'away', 'decades', 'marriage', 'Eve', 'perfectionism', 'ultimately', 'blamed', 'everyone', 'else', 'problems', 'materialistic', 'decorator', 'who', 'objects', 'talismans', 'secure', 'grip', 'world', 'increasingly', 'hostile', 'film', 'Eve', 'seen', 'quot', 'perfect', 'quot', 'family', 'delusion', 'part', 'Eve', 'treated', 'everyone', 'around', 'object', 'nobody', 'image', 'impossible', 'live', 'up', 'Wrapped', 'up', 'own', 'competitiveness', 'selfish', 'concerns', 'daughters', 'pay', 'little', 'attention', 'cries', 'help', 'barely', 'seem', 'see', 'real', 'person', 'Indeed', 'Eve', 'finally', 'driven', 'suicide', 'not', 'only', 'ex-husband', 'remarriage', 'hostility', 'middle', 'daughter', 'Joey', 'who', 'devastating', 'monologue', 'hated', 'years', 'Joey', 'Renata', 'domineering', 'unstable', 'emotionally', 'cold', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'resemble', 'Eve', 'own', 'marriages', 'are', 'trouble', 'similar', 'reasons', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'really', 'Joey', 'brilliant', 'frustrated', 'woman', 'who', 'trapped', 'quot', 'perfect', 'quot', 'sisters', 'one', 'talented', 'Renata', 'other', 'beautiful', 'Flyn', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'artist', ""n't"", 'have', 'talent', 'Joey', 'also', 'Daddy', 'favorite', 'daughter', 'still', 'further', 'resentment', 'Renata', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'free-spirited', 'coke-snorting', 'hardly', 'film', 'when', 'obviously', 'meant', 'contrast', 'vapidity', 'quot', 'L.A.', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'east', 'coast', 'fragile', 'network', 'relationships', 'apart', 'one', 'fateful', 'night', 'East', 'Hampton', 'when', 'Daddy', 'Pearl', 'none-too-bright', 'rather', 'vulgar', 'Jewish', 'widow', 'family', 'house', 'fight', 'out', 'reception', 'everyone', 'proceeds', 'get', 'very', 'drunk', 'Renata', 'husband', 'nearly', 'rapes', 'Flyn', 'Eve', 'party', 'only', 'be', 'mocked', 'vilified', 'own', 'child', 'Eve', 'walking', 'Atlantic', 'Ocean', 'just', 'outside', 'Joey', 'nearly', 'trying', 'save', 'pulled', 'water', 'resuscitated', 'Pearl', 'whom', 'had', 'insulted', 'earlier', 'evening', 'sequence', 'AWESOME', 'Exquisitely', 'shot', 'edited', 'moment', 'Eve', 'Renata', 'Flyn', 'open', 'eyes', 'sound', 'sleep', 'only', 'sound', 'unending', 'BOOM', 'waves', 'shore', 'one', 'scene', 'film', 'deep', 'quot', 'cinematic', 'art', 'quot', 'Allen', 'was', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'create', 'Everything', 'INTERIORS', 'well', 'summed', 'up', 'moment', 'said', 'film', 'times', 'unbearably', 'pretentious', 'Best', 'Unintentionally', 'Funny', 'Line', 'Joey', 'Pearl', 'quot', 'VULGARIAN', 'quot', 'Oh', 'emotionally', 'one-sided', 'people', 'seem', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'single', 'happy', 'moment', 'lives', 'fashionable', 'wardrobes', 'successful', 'careers', 'expensive', 'Manhattan', 'Long', 'Island', 'real', 'estate', ""'m"", 'sure', 'whole', 'thing', 'supposed', 'be', 'dissection', 'emotional', 'underpinnings', 'WASP-culture', 'scene', 'scene', 'so', 'overwritten', 'whole', 'thing', 'unbelievably', 'ponderous', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'vibrant-but-dumb', 'Pearl', 'even', 'character', 'trashy', 'yenta', 'cliche', 'Pearl', 'wears', 'bright', 'red', 'time', 'talks', 'food', 'lot', 'WOW', 'must', 'be', 'symbol', 'Jewish', 'vitality', 'versus', 'WASP', 'restraint', 'what', 'original', 'idea', 'Woody', 'film', 'also', 'certain', 'high-70', 'quot', 'Me-decade', 'quot', 'quality', 'evinced', 'such', 'lines', ""'m"", 'sick', 'needs', 'insecurities', 'have', 'own', 'problems', 'quot', 'again', 'unintentionally', 'comical', 'Still', 'graceful', 'intense', 'acting', 'whole', 'thing', 'pretensions', 'last', 'shot', 'defines', 'term', 'quot', 'quot', 'self-consciousness', 'INTERIORS', 'still', 'emotional', 'punch', 'happen', 'be', 'East', 'Coast', 'intellectual', 'type', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'dialogue', 'will', 'leave', 'stranded', 'See', 'film', 'performances', 'often-exquisite', 'compositions', 'else', 'may', 'be', 'INTERIORS', 'unique', 'American', 'cinema', 'experiment', ""n't"", 'been', 'repeated']",N/A
155031,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,0792846087,California Dreaming,"[2, 2]","Should this film be called &#34;Exteriors&#34; instead?  After all, it shows people in a family who always put up walls and rarely show their emotions.  You rarely if ever get to see into anyone's true psyche here.There was a Woody Allen Marathon going on this weekend, and so I finally was able to watch this film and &#34;Alice&#34; as well, two that I hadn't seen yet.  Looking quickly at the ratings, I saw that most people liked this film better than &#34;Alice,&#34; but I believe that it should have been the other way around.  While this film is dark and moody, &#34;Alice&#34; is actually pretty funny and more entertaining.But returning to the &#34;Exteriors&#34; idea, the name &#34;Interiors&#34; actually does work better for the filmmaker as the word applies to not only people withholding emotions, but also to art and design as well.  More than likely, that is why Mr. Allen chose this name, which was therefore fitting.  (I'm just guessing, but I'll bet that he struggled just naming this picture.)This film is not one that you can honestly say, without being pretentious, that you &#34;like.&#34;  Rather, it is one that you might &#34;appreciate.&#34;  Most of the characters aren't particularly likeable really, outside of perhaps an older female character who is introduced late in the second act from what I remember.  And you may only like her character because she is more likeable than most everyone else.  She is not pretentious, she likes to live her life -- unlike the mother character here -- and she likes everyday things like card tricks and dancing.  She is not an intellectual and, while she's not proud of it, she's not ashamed either.  (The father character is also mostly sympathetic, but he does make a decision at one point that attempts to undermine that sympathy for him, even though you completely understand why he does what he does.)It seemed to me that Mr. Allen was exploring his own psyche here a bit, and the way that he lives his own life.  Surely he's no dummy -- to me he's one of the best filmmakers ever -- and he's surely not poor either.  But is he happy?  Well, if you ever watch him in a documentary, while he's not depressed per se, he seems to wonder himself if his own life has gone in the right direction.  I think that Mr. Allen shouldn't even wonder really, as he's been more than an overachiever.  But my opinion doesn't matter.  What does matter is his own opinion; how he feels on the inside, or his own Interior.I'll give this film a mild recommendation, but like I said, I liked &#34;Alice&#34; a little bit more.

became increasingly important to him to see if he could pull off straight drama.  if he could, his art frontiers would expand greatly. since his greatest talent has always been his writing, it really should have come as no surprise that he could write drama.  ironically, his best comedy would increasingly depend on the contrast and counterweight he provided with his drama. so i always thought this film was a great artistic triumph for him.  seeing it again in 2013, nothing has changed my mind.basically, a wealthy lawyer father with a mentally ill wife and three grown children, divorces the wife and remarries a healthy, robust widow. the mother continues to shatter and the three daughters try to find their own lives apart from their parents' lifelong unhappiness.there are many great performances in this ensemble piece but the world class one is geraldine page's as the shattered ex wife. she is magnificent. she is completely unsympathetic and your most constant wish for her is that she just die.  every detail about her is perfectly rendered.  her entire life is minimalist elegance. her only real interest is interior decor but all she can make is one cold, austere room after another.  she constantly redoes rooms because she is never satisfied with them.  she obsesses about the tiniest details such as the palest and slenderest of vases, the exact right stripping of the hardwood floors, small white lamps by which one can barely see, and an appearance all in black or monotones with hair scraped back into the tighest twist.  she is ugly in so many ways as she tries to

even though he's sixty three.  e.g. marhsall does a fine job with him, especially his ""irrevocable"" speech.  this ridiculous speech, a total lie, sums up his character better than anything else

I'll take ""Annie Hall"" and ""Hollywood Ending"" over ""Husbands and Wives"" and ""Bullets Over Broadway"" any day.  And as far as his dramas go this one is just about as dark as they get.  The story focuses on a family of miserable people who derive joy only from causing more misery within the family.  I liked the way the film was fearless in looking at the way families argue.  I felt many times that I had accidentally wandered into my own living room. . .especially when Eve was causing a scene over the lamp.  It also remained very grounded, at least until the very end.  Allen deals with life's big issues in this film such as death, expectations, and truth.  At times he digs too deep for the sake of the movie, but I will take that concession to get a movie this good.  Of course by saying that I will probably be lampooned in his next film as a nave fool who can't understand why the movie I'm watching doesn't have any explosions.  In this film he takes the obligatory shot at those who only see art for their surface value, and a woman named Pearl is his stand in punching bag.  In the end, Allen teaches us that truth is good, until it morphs into cruelty, and that in the interior of the world we know we can try to protect those we love, but when they run up against the waves of the real world there is nothing we can do.3.75 out of 5",4,Woody Allen does Neil LaBute,1102204800,"12 5, 2004",2004,1430,"['general', 'tend', 'slant', 'towards', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'comedies', 'opposed', 'dramas', ""'ll"", 'take', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Hollywood', 'Ending', 'Husbands', 'Wives', 'Bullets', 'Broadway', 'day', 'as', 'far', 'dramas', 'go', 'one', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'dark', 'get', 'story', 'family', 'miserable', 'people', 'who', 'derive', 'joy', 'only', 'causing', 'more', 'misery', 'family', 'liked', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'fearless', 'looking', 'way', 'families', 'argue', 'felt', 'many', 'times', 'had', 'accidentally', 'wandered', 'own', 'living', 'room', '.especially', 'when', 'Eve', 'was', 'causing', 'scene', 'lamp', 'also', 'remained', 'very', 'grounded', 'least', 'very', 'end', 'Allen', 'deals', 'life', 'big', 'issues', 'film', 'such', 'death', 'expectations', 'truth', 'times', 'too', 'deep', 'sake', 'movie', 'will', 'take', 'concession', 'get', 'movie', 'good', 'course', 'saying', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'lampooned', 'next', 'film', 'nave', 'fool', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'movie', ""'m"", 'watching', ""n't"", 'have', 'explosions', 'film', 'obligatory', 'shot', 'who', 'only', 'see', 'art', 'surface', 'value', 'woman', 'named', 'Pearl', 'stand', 'punching', 'bag', 'end', 'Allen', 'truth', 'good', 'cruelty', 'interior', 'world', 'know', 'can', 'try', 'protect', 'love', 'when', 'run', 'up', 'waves', 'real', 'world', 'nothing', 'can', 'do.3.75', '5']",N/A
155034,A38ZNHOJMXWHR2,0792846087,Christopher Ingalls,"[5, 6]","Woody Allen threw the film world a curveball in 1978 when he released not only his first straight dramatic film, but also the first film he directed that he didn't appear in. Although the film confused and possibly enraged some fans, it holds up today as, in my opinion, one of his most strikingly daring films.It's obvious to anyone watching ""Interiors"" that this is an homage to Allen's favorite director, the great Ingmar Bergman. The quiet, the seriousness, the dysfunction -- it's ""Cries and Whispers"" for the Manhattan intelligentsia. While the film obviously pays tribute to Bergman, it's no mere copy. It has a life and style of its own, mainly due to the performances.The film deals with a wealthy, successful man (E.G. Marshall) who decides to separate from his unstable wife (Geraldine Page). The wife is thrown into depression and suicide attempts. Her three daughters are there to help, but can only do so much. Diane Keaton plays the stable, earthy Renata. Her husband is a failed writer and an alcoholic (played by Richard Jordan). Joey (Mary Beth Hurt) is the neurotic, stuffy, moody one who can't seem to find happiness in any profession she attempts. Her husband is played by Sam Waterston, and he's probably the one normal person in the whole film. The third daughter, Flynn, is played by Kristin Griffith as a TV-movie actress whose films are always panned by her family, both in and out of her presence. Maureen Stapleton plays the role of Pearl, the feisty woman Marshall begins dating soon after his separation. His children are surprised that he wants to remarry so soon, and Joey shows open contempt for his choice of a new wife.This is not ""Bananas,"" ""Sleeper,"" or even ""Annie Hall."" This is Woody Allen showing the dark recesses of family dysfunction. Geraldine Page is simply outstanding as the mentally unstable middle-aged woman. The scene where she ""prepares"" for her first suicide attempt is extremely dark and sad. Her final ""beach"" scene is beautifully shot. The rest of the cast does a great job, but she is head and shoulders above the rest.It's interesting to see Allen stretch out with this style of filmmaking, and I think it works very well. He has obviously studied Bergman's works carefully. This is no mere copy, it's a beautiful homage.The picture quality is good but not excellent for a DVD transfer. And as with all of Allen's discs, there's really not much in the area of extras -- just a trailer.

I saw Woody Allen's INTERIORS more than 20 years ago when it was theatrically released and I never had the opportunity to see it again since then. Well, I must say that the movie stands perfectly the test of time and is far better than the actual psychodramas delivered by Hollywood. There is a simple reason for that. While most of today serious directors and screenwriters use the cinema media only as a way to expose their own neurosis to the audience for a US$ 20 million consultation,  Woody Allen, in his first - serious-  movie, chose to present a universal story that could touch the european viewer as well as the New -York intelligentsia.If one often thinks about Ingmar Berman during the meaningful silences of INTERIORS, the reference to Tschekhov seems to me more relevant. The three sisters staring through the window is obviously a reminiscence of the theatrical play THE THREE SISTERS of the russian writer and one would nearly expect to hear Diane Keaton whisper &quot; Moscow... Moscow... &quot; at this moment. Tschekhov is also present in the cruel little sentences written by an inspired Woody Allen or in the sudden explosions of hate that burst out with an unexpected violence from these so quiet people.Apart from the choice of different subtitles and a trailer, no bonus features with this DVD.

It's the same characters he will later add flesh to in Hannah, Manhattan, and Crimes &amp; Misdemeanors.  Here again, you'll find Upper East siders burdened with their vices: Infidelity, infertility, domineering mothers and alienated artists. The difference is that with Interiors there's not a ounce of humor, and we keep waiting for the punch line -- it's the funniest movie ever made without a single joke.  And when we realize there's no wit, we wait for Allen to deliver some serious insight.  Sometimes they do, as with the mother, who is the fullest idea he's ever had for a character, and sometimes they don't, and the rest of the cast seems like uneven caricitures.  Allen has chose to make a movie begging sympathy for the same people he's systematically satirized throughout his career.  But he doesn't give sympathy himself, the camera is so tight and the shots so sterile that you keep checking your pulse to make sure it's still beating.  Is it right to criticize the filmmaker for doing something different?  The resentment of this film may be directed not towards the movie but towards its creator for being a near hypocrite.  We accept him for making us laugh, but how dare he try to make us feel a different emotion (like pity.)  We love when our artists break new ground but we don't like it when they change.  It makes us feel uneasy because we have to open ourselves up and learn a whole new thing.  Interiors, as you've heard, is a Bergman copy (there's barely a  soundtrack), but it's a well made Bergman copy, and for a lot of us that's enough.  I'd rather a young filmmaker xerox Autumn Sonata than The Big Sleep.  They're both good movies, but you can't take the latter any further than it's already been (you're not supposed to).",3,Interiors,983318400,"02 28, 2001",2001,1851,"[""'re"", 'familiar', 'Woody', 'Allen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'same', 'characters', 'will', 'later', 'add', 'flesh', 'Hannah', 'Manhattan', 'Crimes', 'amp', 'Misdemeanors', 'Here', 'again', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Upper', 'East', 'siders', 'burdened', 'vices', 'Infidelity', 'infertility', 'domineering', 'mothers', 'alienated', 'artists', 'difference', 'Interiors', 'not', 'ounce', 'humor', 'keep', 'waiting', 'punch', 'line', 'funniest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'single', 'joke', 'when', 'realize', 'wit', 'wait', 'Allen', 'deliver', 'serious', 'insight', 'Sometimes', 'do', 'mother', 'who', 'fullest', 'idea', 'ever', 'had', 'character', 'sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'rest', 'cast', 'uneven', 'caricitures', 'Allen', 'chose', 'make', 'movie', 'begging', 'sympathy', 'same', 'people', 'systematically', 'satirized', 'career', ""n't"", 'give', 'sympathy', 'camera', 'so', 'tight', 'shots', 'so', 'sterile', 'keep', 'checking', 'pulse', 'make', 'sure', 'still', 'beating', 'right', 'criticize', 'filmmaker', 'doing', 'something', 'different', 'resentment', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'directed', 'not', 'movie', 'creator', 'being', 'near', 'hypocrite', 'accept', 'making', 'laugh', 'how', 'dare', 'make', 'feel', 'different', 'emotion', 'pity', 'love', 'when', 'artists', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'change', 'feel', 'uneasy', 'have', 'open', 'up', 'learn', 'whole', 'new', 'thing', 'Interiors', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Bergman', 'copy', 'barely', 'soundtrack', 'well', 'made', 'Bergman', 'copy', 'lot', 'enough', ""'d"", 'rather', 'young', 'filmmaker', 'xerox', 'Autumn', 'Sonata', 'Big', 'Sleep', ""'re"", 'good', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'latter', 'further', 'already', 'been', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed']",N/A
155038,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0792846087,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 8]","It's pretty obvious that Woody Allen was so resistant in being confined as a comedy filmmaker that in the throes of his success with the wondrous ""Annie Hall"", he felt a need to make an &uuml;ber-serious drama in the Ingmar Bergman mode. This 1978 Chekhovian family drama is the result, and it is alternately affecting and exasperating. The key problem is that Allen presents such a hermetically sealed world of intellectuals and artistic souls that the interactions among the characters feel pointed and self-conscious. He has obviously since learned that his best films (""Manhattan"", ""Hannah and Her Sisters"") are served most by his particular balance between comedy and drama.The story concerns an upscale New York family reacting to the news that patriarch Arthur wants to leave his psychologically unstable wife Eve just released from a sanitarium. They have three daughters, all of whom are grappling with their own problems. Eldest sister Renata is a successful poet stuck in a volatile marriage to Frederick, a fellow writer whose lack of commercial success has merely heightened his jealousy and paranoia. Middle daughter Joey is Arthur's favorite, but she is unable to figure out what to do with her life, and her constant flailing frustrates everyone around her in spite of the patience of her boyfriend Michael. Youngest daughter Flyn is the beautiful, emotionally isolated one who moved to Hollywood to become a semi-successful actress.They all respond to their mother Eve's neediness in different ways, and the inevitable turning point comes when Arthur finalizes the divorce and remarries, this time to a passionate, fun-loving widow named Pearl. Even though Gordon Willis' beige-dominated cinematography and the frigid, almost-too-perfect art direction by Mel Bourne and Daniel Robert lend the extreme austerity for which Allen seems to be striving, the acting is what makes this film dramatically effective. Mary Beth Hurt gives a brave performance as Joey, capturing all the inadequacy and wounded rejection her character feels. Maureen Stapleton is a breath of fresh air as Pearl, lending an amusing earthiness and colorful indifference when she arrives late in the story.With her severe look, Geraldine Page effectively lends unrelenting, humorless intensity to her heavily mannered portrayal of Eve and turns her character into a hopelessly desperate victim as the story moves toward its conclusion. As Renata, Diane Keaton removes all traces of the lovable Annie Hall but unfortunately comes across as the most contrived, especially when her character cannot help but be patronizing to Frederick and Joey. Richard Jordan plays Frederick in broad strokes that make it difficult to empathize with his plight. Making lesser impressions are Sam Waterson as Michael, Kristin Griffith as Flyn and a surprisingly understated E.G. Marshall as Arthur.

L'hoir,"[5, 5]","When ""Interiors"" was first released it was generally deplored by moviegoers, largely because it did not live up to their expectations of what a Woody Allen film should be: a laugh-out-loud comedy like ""Annie Hall,"" or ""Sleeper."" It was as if Allen should be allowed to make only one kind of film (One might as well complain about Mozart having had the nerve to write the ""Requiem"" after ""The Magic Flute""; or, conversely, Verdi having the effrontery to write ""Falstaff"" after ""Othello."" One wonders whether Shakespeare had the same problem: ""What dost thou mean that thou art writing of a Shrewish Wench from Padua?  Beshrew thy Heart! . . . We want more Titus Andronicus!"").With time and distance, one can appreciate ""Interiors"" for what it is, an intense drama about a family in the process of disintegration. The film is beautifully acted by an ensemble cast that includes Geraldine Page as the  mother, who is so quietly self-effacing that, like a vacuum, she seems to draw the energy out of any room she enters; E.G. Marshall, as a man who has been a good father, but who must now escape the house's stifling atmosphere; the three sisters, Kristin Griffith, who has already escaped to Hollywood and a middling career as an actress; Diane Keaton, who has removed herself to Connecticut--and writer's block; and Marybeth Hurt, the Elektra of the piece, whose love for her father, hatred of her mother, and competitiveness with her writer-sister have come to dominate her life. The static dynamic of this imbalance of power is upset when the father introduces an interloper, beautifully acted by Maureen Stapleton.Some have remarked, not without cause, that Allen has given the husbands of Keaton and Hurt (Richard Jordan and Sam Waterston respectively) the short end of the acting stick; but, I believe, that is his point, which certainly reflects the title of the film, ""Interiors."" The very dysfunction at the core of the family has caused the daughters to exclude themselves not only from each other but also from their respective spouses, who remain outsiders. It is only at the end that the sisters come to recognize and accept their flaws, and consequently find some resolution, as the camera outside the house looking inward at their faces--framed by the window--implies.Woody Allen's ""Interiors"" will not leave you laughing, but it will certainly leave you thinking, perhaps about how quickly time passes in respect to one's family.",5,Bleak House,1220313600,"09 2, 2008",2008,2443,"['When', 'Interiors', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'was', 'generally', 'deplored', 'moviegoers', 'largely', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'what', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'laugh-out-loud', 'comedy', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Sleeper', 'was', 'Allen', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'make', 'only', 'one', 'kind', 'film', 'One', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'complain', 'Mozart', 'having', 'had', 'nerve', 'write', 'Requiem', 'Magic', 'Flute', 'conversely', 'Verdi', 'having', 'effrontery', 'write', 'Falstaff', 'Othello', 'One', 'Shakespeare', 'had', 'same', 'problem', 'What', 'dost', 'thou', 'mean', 'thou', 'art', 'writing', 'Shrewish', 'Wench', 'Padua', 'Beshrew', 'thy', 'Heart', 'want', 'more', 'Titus', 'Andronicus', '.With', 'time', 'distance', 'one', 'can', 'appreciate', 'Interiors', 'what', 'intense', 'drama', 'family', 'process', 'disintegration', 'film', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'mother', 'who', 'so', 'quietly', 'self-effacing', 'vacuum', 'draw', 'energy', 'room', 'E.G', 'Marshall', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'good', 'father', 'who', 'must', 'now', 'escape', 'house', 'stifling', 'atmosphere', 'three', 'sisters', 'Kristin', 'Griffith', 'who', 'already', 'escaped', 'Hollywood', 'middling', 'career', 'actress', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'who', 'removed', 'Connecticut', 'writer', 'block', 'Marybeth', 'Hurt', 'Elektra', 'piece', 'love', 'father', 'hatred', 'mother', 'competitiveness', 'writer-sister', 'have', 'come', 'dominate', 'life', 'static', 'dynamic', 'imbalance', 'power', 'upset', 'when', 'father', 'interloper', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton.Some', 'have', 'remarked', 'not', 'cause', 'Allen', 'given', 'husbands', 'Keaton', 'Hurt', 'Richard', 'Jordan', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'respectively', 'short', 'end', 'acting', 'stick', 'believe', 'point', 'certainly', 'title', 'film', 'Interiors', 'very', 'dysfunction', 'core', 'family', 'caused', 'daughters', 'exclude', 'not', 'only', 'other', 'also', 'respective', 'spouses', 'who', 'remain', 'outsiders', 'only', 'end', 'sisters', 'come', 'recognize', 'accept', 'flaws', 'consequently', 'find', 'resolution', 'camera', 'house', 'looking', 'inward', 'framed', 'window', 'implies.Woody', 'Allen', 'Interiors', 'will', 'not', 'leave', 'laughing', 'will', 'certainly', 'leave', 'thinking', 'perhaps', 'how', 'quickly', 'time', 'passes', 'respect', 'one', 'family']",N/A

""Interiors"" is Allen's dissection of an upper middle class family in crisis. The story is not original. Arthur (E.G. Marshall), the husband of a Long Island interior designer Eve (Geraldine Page), demanding and imperious, and father of their three grown daughters (Diane Keaton, Marybeth Hurt and Kristin Griffith), informs his wife that he wanted a trial separation. She hopes that it is temporary but soon learns that there is another woman involved, (Maureen Stapleton), twice a widow, ""a vulgarian"" who does not belong to the upper class but is full of life, humor, and warmth and whom Arthur wants to marry. More than anything, this movie reminds the most famous shot in Bergman's ""Persona"" - two faces combined in one. You are not sure which features are Liv's and which - Bibi's. With ""Interiors"", it is difficult to say where Bergman ends and Allen begins. I would also compare Allen's first exercise in creating a serious drama to Bergman's attempt in comedy, ""All these women"". Both masters tried to do something different from what they were expected by the critics and their audience and both did not achieve a success. I respect Allen's homage to Bergman's work but I think he is much more interesting when he combines drama and comedy in his films. I admire his ability to create the movies that are subtle and cruel, darker than dark and self-ironic, profound and touchingly poignant, deadly serious and incredibly funny - at the same time.

In this time of video art and digital manipulation of images, both in real time and in fixed entities, INTERIORS exemplifies the finest in what film can achieve.  Without manipulation of scenery, without (gratefully) a senses-asaulting musical score, without GIMMICKRY  - here is a film of brilliant writing, stunningly and  beautifully subtle sets and costumes, and acting of the first degree.  The angst so present in our society's family relationships is gently observed and explored and the results are a paean of understated simplicity and pain.  It is difficult to single out any of the outstanding cast as 'best' and that is yet another proof of ensemble acting and directing at a zenith.  Yes, it is unimaginable to leave behind the characters created by Geraldine Page, H.G. Marshall, Diane Keaton, and Maureen Stapleton, but again this is an indicator of how well and cohesive the experience provided by this movie is.I have never been a Woody Allen fan: I find his comedies overwrought, self-absorbed, and frustratingly tedious.

I knew that this film was a drama, a big change from the comedies Woody had previously done.  I always loved Woody's films, many of which contained out and out slapstick comedy.I saw ""Interiors"" again on Blue Ray and realized that the themes Woody has visited in his past films were not so different in ""Interiors.""  Like his comedies, Woody focuses on the creativity, sensitivity, and neuroses of his characters.  Like his earlier, light comedies, one of the themes of ""Interiors"" is the insecurites and severe psychological pain felt, in this case, by the film's mother, in a very intense and heartbreakingly sympathetic performance by the great Geraldine Page.  Ms. Page, Eve, is an interior designer who is also extraordinarily depressed.  Her husband, Arthur, played by E.G. Marshall in a very effective low key performance, can no longer endure his wife's contagious suffering, and decides to separate from her.  Eve's deep emotional problems has also had a serious effect on his three, grown up daughters.  Arthur calls this a temporary move, but one of his daughters, doubts that this is true, but is his first step in finally ending his stultifying marriage.A little later in the film the father introduces his new woman friend to his daughters and their husbands.  Pearl, as played by Maureen Stapleton, is wonderful, and is a complete opposite from Eve.  We learn that Arthur is planning to marry her once his divorce from Eve is completed.  Pearl is an extroverted, very much alive woman who exudes positiveness.  Showing Eve's huge influence, the family apartment is very sparely decorated with very plain colored paint on the walls and pale blue vases. In contrast, Pearl is wearing a bright red dress.  The others are very plainly attired, showing that most of them, except for the youngest sister, Flyn, have been leading repressed lives.  The middle daughter, Joey, refers to Pearl as a vulgarian.I will not give away the film's ending, which is not totally unexpected, but is tragic.  Besides the all around excellent performances of the film's actors, Woody adds a mood of despair as a result of the sparceness of the sets.  It is clear that Woody's direction was influenced a great deal by Ingmar Bergman.  Also, there is no musical background, unusual for a Woody Allen film, except for the dance music at the new couple's wedding.I thoroughly recommend ""Interiors"" to Woody Allen fans, some of whom may have some difficulty accepting his turn to serious drama.",5,Woody Allen's first non-comedy,1376870400,"08 19, 2013",2013,2573,"['remember', 'seeing', 'Interiors', 'first', 'time', '1978', 'movie', 'theater', 'Manhattan', 'knew', 'film', 'was', 'drama', 'big', 'change', 'comedies', 'Woody', 'had', 'previously', 'done', 'always', 'loved', 'Woody', 'films', 'many', 'contained', 'out', 'slapstick', 'comedy.I', 'saw', 'Interiors', 'again', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'realized', 'themes', 'Woody', 'visited', 'past', 'films', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'different', 'Interiors', 'comedies', 'Woody', 'creativity', 'sensitivity', 'neuroses', 'characters', 'earlier', 'light', 'comedies', 'one', 'themes', 'Interiors', 'insecurites', 'severe', 'psychological', 'pain', 'felt', 'case', 'film', 'mother', 'very', 'intense', 'heartbreakingly', 'sympathetic', 'performance', 'great', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'Ms', 'Page', 'Eve', 'interior', 'designer', 'who', 'also', 'extraordinarily', 'depressed', 'husband', 'Arthur', 'played', 'E.G', 'Marshall', 'very', 'effective', 'low', 'key', 'performance', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'endure', 'wife', 'contagious', 'suffering', 'decides', 'separate', 'Eve', 'deep', 'emotional', 'problems', 'also', 'had', 'serious', 'effect', 'three', 'grown', 'up', 'daughters', 'Arthur', 'temporary', 'move', 'one', 'daughters', 'doubts', 'true', 'first', 'step', 'finally', 'ending', 'stultifying', 'marriage.A', 'little', 'later', 'film', 'father', 'new', 'woman', 'friend', 'daughters', 'husbands', 'Pearl', 'played', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'wonderful', 'complete', 'opposite', 'Eve', 'learn', 'Arthur', 'planning', 'marry', 'once', 'divorce', 'Eve', 'completed', 'Pearl', 'extroverted', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'woman', 'who', 'positiveness', 'Showing', 'Eve', 'huge', 'influence', 'family', 'apartment', 'very', 'sparely', 'decorated', 'very', 'plain', 'colored', 'paint', 'walls', 'pale', 'blue', 'vases', 'contrast', 'Pearl', 'wearing', 'bright', 'red', 'dress', 'others', 'are', 'very', 'plainly', 'attired', 'showing', 'most', 'youngest', 'sister', 'Flyn', 'have', 'been', 'leading', 'repressed', 'lives', 'middle', 'daughter', 'Joey', 'refers', 'Pearl', 'vulgarian.I', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'film', 'ending', 'not', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'tragic', 'excellent', 'performances', 'film', 'actors', 'Woody', 'mood', 'despair', 'result', 'sparceness', 'sets', 'clear', 'Woody', 'direction', 'was', 'influenced', 'great', 'deal', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Also', 'musical', 'background', 'unusual', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'dance', 'music', 'new', 'couple', 'wedding.I', 'thoroughly', 'recommend', 'Interiors', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'fans', 'whom', 'may', 'have', 'difficulty', 'accepting', 'turn', 'serious', 'drama']",N/A

155047,A15RB66290XLRH,0792846087,Jessica,"[3, 3]","The starkness and instability in this film are amazing. The tone is sad, somber, and broaches every deep side of ourselves. There's not a single ounce of happiness or light-hearted fun. Faces filled with sadness glance out of windows, their eyes exploring for at least a sign of peace within themselves. Their questions still are not answered at the end of the film, unlike most films. The emotions you recieve are unbelieveable.  On a more basic ground, this film is about a family broken up by the father, who decides to seperate his wife, who has spent time in mental hospitals and still is emotionally fragile. The plot expands from there, with the characters silently struggling to deal with the unexpected absence in the family. It becomes worse when the father decides to marry another woman, a woman who is free-spirited and acts in total contrast with Eve, the mentally-ill mother. Eve becomes delusional and suicidal from there. The three sisters tries to cope in their own ways, but there is always an antagonism surfacing, even though they won't say it out loud.  This film hit me deeply and left me in tears. I love movies with morals, and this one is a perfect example.  For me, the moral was that you cannot have everything answered in your life, much as you want them to be. But it's not the solitary reason why I loved it so much.  It's very unlike Woody Allen's style, whose films are always filled with satire and neurotism, as well as a fun-packed wallop of laughs. I loved this movie because it really showed the characters' dark sides, their inward battles, their frustration of not being able to express to one another, and their inability to make themselves happy, among much more. There is no trace of happiness. The characters rarely smile, but when they do, it's doled out forcefully. Their pain is heartbreakingly evident.  The title, &quot;Interiors&quot; is a perfect title. It matches the mother and daughters. Eve, beyond her power to change things, tries to cope by buying expensive things and rearranging them all around the house so they can look pretty, clean, and available for everyone to look at, in exact opposition to her struggles inward. But the vases and frames she buys are void of color; they are white, like everything else in the house. Not a single thing is out of place, no curtains grace the windows, and everything looks shiny, smooth, and tight. It does not have the mark of a family, but the mark of a person who is about to go over the edge.The daughters are detached from their mother, and from each other. They greet each other with polite hellos and wan smiles. Renata and Joey, the two most developed characters, compete against each other, and they differ in support for Eve-Joey tries to steer her back to the realization that there's no possible chance for a reconciliation, and Renata is the type to shove things under the carpet and try to smooth out the bumps.  The questions we ask will linger to which there's no answer. Everything is as it should be-unanswered. You can feel the tension pressing down on you in the air, your breath shorten and staggen, and marvel at the enormity of this movie. There is no room for a morsel of cheerfulness, but forced smiles and downcast eyes in which silent battles rage behind their placid facades.  I've never been able to forget the very last scene when the three sisters glance out of a window simultaneously and Joey says, &quot;The water's so calm.&quot; and Renata says, &quot;Yes. It's very peaceful.&quot; Words that may seem simple and common, but it's the very antithesis-their struggles with themselves hasn't died. Everything is left suspended in the air, with no coherent and rational answer. Plus, the way Hurt and Keaton said it, with their eyes continually searching..was I the only one who was sobbing my eyes out? I noticed every last detail to this scene and their immense sadness. I could go on all night blabbing about this beautiful film, but I don't think there are any words available for description. I've tried my best. As one of the few seventeen-year-old girls on this planet that likes Woody Allen, this is yet another masterful to add to my collection.

155048,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,0792846087,Kerry Walters,"[7, 10]","Allen has said on several occasions that he doesn't have the stuff to make movies of the same caliber as his Fellini and Bergman, his two cinematic heroes.  Nothing attests to the truth of that self-estimation better than ""Interiors.""  Don't get me wrong.  Mr. Allen has made some excellent films.  ""Zelig"" and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" are two of the best American movies you'll find.  But ""Interiors"" has a ring of inauthenticity to it from the very beginning.  It looks like something that a talented undergraduate film student who worships Bergman would've put together.""Interiors"" apes Bergman in just about every way imaginable:  the absence of a musical score; long shots of faces; silent moments longer than Hollywood convention; soliloquies about death, relationships, and angst; empty room- and landscapes; and characters struggling to reconcile inner and outer lives.  This all works with Bergman.  But in ""Interiors,"" it comes across almost as parody rather than homage.  The final scene in the film, with the three sisters profiled as they gaze out onto an empty ocean, is embarrassingly portentious.  The artistic struggles of Richard Jordan's character are hackneyed.  The actress sister character seems an afterthought never fully developed.  The father figure has no depth (even E.G. Marshall, a great character actor, couldn't quite pull it off).  And the ""interior"" struggles the characters undergo too often seem either contrived (the middle sister's inability to find a creative outlet) or stereotypical (the eldest sister's writer's block).There are, however, two breaths of fresh air in the fim.  Maureen Stapleton's acting is superb, and the dance scene in which she breaks a vase (another piece of heavy-handed symbolism) is masterfully done.  Geraldine Page, an actress I don't normally care for, is brilliant in her portrayal of the psychologically and emotionally broken jilted wife.  And she, unlike so many of the other characters, had good script from which to work.  It's as if all of Allen's creative genius went into the writing of her character.The film is worth seeing, I suppose, because it's an Allen film.

Beautifully photographed by Gordon Willis, with amazing performances (Geraldine Page, Mary Beth Hurt, Maureen Stapleton in particular are brilliant, but everyone is good).

155051,A3664K3GZV3LLY,0792846087,Matthew McWilliams,"[3, 3]","&quot;Interiors&quot; (1978) is Woody Allen's most serious film. His equally intelligent &quot;September&quot; (1987) runs a close second. If you've enjoyed either one make sure you see the other. To fully appreciate  &quot;Interiors&quot;, it is good to note the context in which it was made.  After Allen made the smash-hit &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (to this day  hilarious and heartwarming) he wanted to prove the breadth of his talent  with a film of a totally different tone. Hence &quot;Interiors&quot; was  born and there is certainly nothing much to laugh about here. The colours  are cold and the characters are caustic and critical. That being said, the  film is superbly done. The mother of the household is in internal chaos and  to compensate she makes the interior of her home too perfect for human  touch. We delve deeply into the spiritual interiors of her daughters and  live through their frustrations, resentments and aspirations. Sometimes  it's hard to see them in so much torment. This is a melancholy film where  no-one has little reason to smile and rarely does. But it is a brave,  honest and perceptive work which Allen and his actresses should all be  proud of. An interesting aside is the names Allen has given his characters.  The only character who realy loves life is called &quot;Pearl&quot;. Maybe  the other characters in the film need to find this essence in themselves.  The cool mother is named &quot;Eve&quot;. - ironic as Eve means  &quot;life&quot; and &quot;lively&quot; and the mother is anything but  lively. She is however, like the biblical Eve in that she aspires to make  her home like Eden. The Renata (Keaton) character means &quot;reborn&quot;  which she is through her poetry and detachment from her mother.  &quot;Joey&quot; jumps around from job to job trying to find herself. The  acting, writing and photography are exceptional. This is &quot;Hannah and  Her Sisters&quot; without the laughs but with much more depth. If you are  prepared to accept the total solemnity of it all watch this fascinating  insight into the human condition.",4,An impeccable tapestry.,954633600,"04 2, 2000",2000,2088,"['quot', 'Interiors', 'quot', '1978', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'most', 'serious', 'film', 'equally', 'intelligent', 'quot', 'September', 'quot', '1987', 'close', 'second', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'one', 'make', 'sure', 'see', 'other', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'quot', 'Interiors', 'quot', 'good', 'note', 'context', 'was', 'made', 'Allen', 'made', 'smash-hit', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'day', 'hilarious', 'heartwarming', 'wanted', 'prove', 'breadth', 'talent', 'film', 'totally', 'different', 'tone', 'Hence', 'quot', 'Interiors', 'quot', 'was', 'born', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'much', 'laugh', 'here', 'colours', 'are', 'cold', 'characters', 'are', 'caustic', 'critical', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'superbly', 'done', 'mother', 'household', 'internal', 'chaos', 'compensate', 'interior', 'home', 'too', 'perfect', 'human', 'touch', 'delve', 'deeply', 'spiritual', 'interiors', 'daughters', 'live', 'frustrations', 'resentments', 'aspirations', 'hard', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'torment', 'melancholy', 'film', 'where', 'no-one', 'little', 'reason', 'smile', 'rarely', 'brave', 'honest', 'perceptive', 'work', 'Allen', 'actresses', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'interesting', 'aside', 'names', 'Allen', 'given', 'characters', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'realy', 'loves', 'life', 'called', 'quot', 'Pearl', 'quot', 'Maybe', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'need', 'find', 'essence', 'cool', 'mother', 'named', 'quot', 'Eve', 'quot', 'ironic', 'Eve', 'quot', 'life', 'quot', 'quot', 'lively', 'quot', 'mother', 'anything', 'lively', 'however', 'biblical', 'Eve', 'make', 'home', 'Eden', 'Renata', 'Keaton', 'character', 'quot', 'quot', 'poetry', 'detachment', 'mother', 'quot', 'Joey', 'quot', 'jumps', 'job', 'job', 'trying', 'find', 'acting', 'writing', 'photography', 'are', 'exceptional', 'quot', 'Hannah', 'Her', 'Sisters', 'quot', 'laughs', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'are', 'prepared', 'accept', 'total', 'solemnity', 'watch', 'fascinating', 'insight', 'human', 'condition']",N/A

First, it is a drama and second, it is Allen's tribute to the films of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman.  So, if you are expecting a comedy, it's not.  And if you hate Ingmar Bergman films, then you won't like this film.Eve (Geraldine Page) has three daughters Renata (Diane Keaton), Joey (Mary Beth Hurt) and Flynn (Kristin Griffith).  She suffered ""a breakdown"" when her husband, Arthur (E.G. Marshall), suddenly leaves her.  She now spends her time redecorating her family homes.).Renata is a successful writer who is seeing a therapist due to writers block and is married to a struggling writer, Frederick (Richard Jordan).  Joey is a book editor, her current job in a long line of failures, who is married to a writer, Michael (Sam Waterston).  Flynn has sold out and gone to Hollywood.This is a film about a dysfunctional family trying to unsuccessfully cope with their problems.  The problem is only increased when Arthur decides to get remarried to the non-intellectual Pearl (Maureen Stapleton).This is a very different and very good Woody Allen.

155055,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,0792846087,Randy Keehn,"[1, 1]","I think Woody Allen is the best director currently in the business and I believe his serious-themed movies are the reason.  He excells at making us look at ourselves.  If I'm not mistaken, ""Interiors"" was his first venture into dramatic movies.  For having led the way, this movie is noteworthy.  However, it is also exemplary in helping define the genre of the Woody Allen movie.  It defines the Woody Allen film by showing us what it is not.Woody Allen's greatness is in being able to let us take a critical look at ourselves.  His characters have faults that we share.  Whatever passions that we have fallen prey to, we see them in a new light through Allen's masterful script and direction.  The problem with ""Interiors"" is that most of us could not relate to the problems that the characters in ""Interiors"" have.  Many of them belong under the category of mental illness while others are taken too far to the extreme to be relevant to us.  Woody was on the right track but he was overly influenced by Ingar Bergman.  Allen's own style quickly emerged after this movie and we have been the better for it.Taken in its' own right, ""Interiors"" is an above-average movie.  The acting is excellent and the mood of the movie is very tense in a somber manner.

The sisters are all very much different from each other. Joey [played by Mary Beth Hurt in a performace that makes me want to gag.] is the sister who can not find herself, even though we're told she has so many talents. You just feel like smaking her and saying, ""Hey, there's people who have it a lot rougher than you out in the world."" The two best things about this film are Geraldine Page and Maureen Stapleton, who were both nominated for Oscars. Stapleton plays the fathers new love interest who isn't like by the whole family, but ends up winning them over. Page brilliantly plays the fragile and distraught mother who is on the verge of suicide. The ending scenes are unavoidable as the story progresses. A great film to watch if your a fan of Allen's or Bergman's. It's also a great film to watch if your a fan of Geraldine Pages.5 1978 ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS:BEST ACTRESS-GERALDINE PAGEBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS-MAUREEN STAPLETONBEST DIRECTOR-WOODY ALLENBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY-WOODY ALLENBEST ART DIRECTION",4,"Not the best Allen film around, but still interesting!",1027728000,"07 27, 2002",2002,1121,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'steps', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'filming', 'falling', 'apart', 'women', 'sisters', 'sisters', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'different', 'other', 'Joey', '[', 'played', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'Hurt', 'performace', 'want', 'gag', ']', 'sister', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'even', ""'re"", 'told', 'so', 'many', 'talents', 'just', 'feel', 'smaking', 'saying', 'Hey', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'lot', 'rougher', 'out', 'world', 'two', 'best', 'things', 'film', 'are', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'who', 'were', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'Stapleton', 'fathers', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'whole', 'family', 'up', 'winning', 'over', 'Page', 'brilliantly', 'fragile', 'distraught', 'mother', 'who', 'verge', 'suicide', 'ending', 'scenes', 'are', 'unavoidable', 'story', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'fan', 'Allen', 'Bergman', 'also', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'fan', 'Geraldine', 'Pages.5', '1978', 'ACADEMY', 'AWARD', 'NOMINATIONS', 'BEST', 'ACTRESS-GERALDINE', 'PAGEBEST', 'SUPPORTING', 'ACTRESS-MAUREEN', 'STAPLETONBEST', 'DIRECTOR-WOODY', 'ALLENBEST', 'ORIGINAL', 'SCREENPLAY-WOODY', 'ALLENBEST', 'ART', 'DIRECTION']",N/A

155061,A1QIL7847ET6HX,0792846087,xxgrendelxx,"[6, 13]","Please understand, I grew up with Woody Allen's films. They were on TV and cable often in the mid to late 1970's. My sibling's and I could perform the dialogue to all his films at will.Yet, when ""Interiors"" was released (I was 9 years old) I was discouraged if not actually disallowed to see it by my folks.Now, there were two catagories that films fell in to earn 'disallowment': the first were films too bizarre and horrific to be seen by a pre-teen. They included at the time ""Eraserhead"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", and ""Alien"", and man, how I wanted to see those films! I did eventually see ""Alien"" via HBO early on but the two former films not until I was in my late twenties (by that time more through inavailability than disallowment).But the second catagory were films too 'adult' in theme and content, films my mother characterised as 'slit-your-wrist flicks', in other words utterly depressing and gloomy. They included ""Interiors"" and ""Ordinary People"" by Robert Redford.I had already been traumatised by the death of ""The Little Prince"" in the film of the same name and by Disney's ""Bambi"" so I never understood what the big deal was - gloom I could handle. Yet, I saw neither Redford's nor Allen's film until last night on TCM.I was expecting a truly heart-wrenching and gut-turning plot and performance. What I receieved was ninety minutes of shrill, obnoxious and empty people bitching at each other until the least likeable died. Redford's film was no eye-opener either, sadly.Not only is there not a single sympathetic character (until the senior girlfriend steps in), but each demeans themselves in the most grotesque fashion until I just didn't care anymore. It eventually became more amusing than any of Allen's comedies (I have a twisted sense of humor and a sadistic streak).Now, I own half of Bergman's films, I understand what Woody was trying to achieve. But I still feel that in the end there just wasn't much said of any empirical importance in ""Interiors"".It seems to me that if one is going to create a story where the principal characters cannibalise each other and obliterate themselves there should be either a) an empirical point made regarding some facet of existence, or b) an element of black humor for the majority of film goers to absorb, that is, the film as cautionary tale. ""b"" doesn't seem to apply here,the film's tone is very serious, and ""a"" is only achieveable if the audience can identify with at least one of the protagonists.I have this same problem with Welles' ""Citizen Kane"": he's not likeable enough to grab my sympathies and he never appears in the film at any other point than the beginning to mourn his lost childhood. It just isn't believable, it comes flying out of nowhere and retreats as quickly leaving at least me saying ""Huh?""But these films are considered classics. Perhaps they have achieved such acclaim because the dark side of banal existence is so rarely explored in American cinema by directors with previous reputations for quality films. Allen has gone on to create a dozen or more great serious films, my favorite being ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"". But this freshman effort has received, both in my personal life and in professionally critical circles, much more credit than it deserves.",1,"Woody, you're killing me!",1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,3252,"['Please', 'understand', 'grew', 'up', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'were', 'TV', 'cable', 'often', 'mid', 'late', '1970', 'sibling', 'could', 'perform', 'dialogue', 'films', 'will.Yet', 'when', 'Interiors', 'was', 'released', 'was', '9', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'discouraged', 'not', 'actually', 'disallowed', 'see', 'folks.Now', 'were', 'two', 'catagories', 'films', 'fell', 'earn', ""'disallowment"", 'first', 'were', 'films', 'too', 'bizarre', 'horrific', 'be', 'seen', 'pre-teen', 'included', 'time', 'Eraserhead', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Alien', 'man', 'how', 'wanted', 'see', 'films', 'did', 'eventually', 'see', 'Alien', 'HBO', 'early', 'two', 'former', 'films', 'not', 'was', 'late', 'twenties', 'time', 'more', 'inavailability', 'disallowment', 'second', 'catagory', 'were', 'films', 'too', ""'adult"", 'theme', 'content', 'films', 'mother', 'characterised', ""'slit-your-wrist"", 'flicks', 'other', 'words', 'utterly', 'depressing', 'gloomy', 'included', 'Interiors', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'Robert', 'Redford.I', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'traumatised', 'death', 'Little', 'Prince', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'Disney', 'Bambi', 'never', 'understood', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'was', 'gloom', 'could', 'handle', 'saw', 'Redford', 'Allen', 'film', 'last', 'night', 'TCM.I', 'was', 'expecting', 'truly', 'heart-wrenching', 'gut-turning', 'plot', 'performance', 'What', 'receieved', 'was', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'shrill', 'obnoxious', 'empty', 'people', 'bitching', 'other', 'least', 'likeable', 'died', 'Redford', 'film', 'was', 'eye-opener', 'either', 'sadly.Not', 'only', 'there', 'not', 'single', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'senior', 'girlfriend', 'steps', 'most', 'grotesque', 'fashion', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'anymore', 'eventually', 'became', 'more', 'amusing', 'Allen', 'comedies', 'have', 'twisted', 'sense', 'humor', 'sadistic', 'streak', '.Now', 'own', 'half', 'Bergman', 'films', 'understand', 'what', 'Woody', 'was', 'trying', 'achieve', 'still', 'feel', 'end', 'there', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'said', 'empirical', 'importance', 'Interiors', '.It', 'one', 'going', 'create', 'story', 'where', 'principal', 'characters', 'cannibalise', 'other', 'obliterate', 'should', 'be', 'empirical', 'point', 'made', 'regarding', 'facet', 'existence', 'b', 'element', 'black', 'humor', 'majority', 'film', 'goers', 'absorb', 'film', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'b', ""n't"", 'seem', 'apply', 'here', 'film', 'tone', 'very', 'serious', 'only', 'achieveable', 'audience', 'can', 'identify', 'least', 'one', 'protagonists.I', 'have', 'same', 'problem', 'Welles', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'not', 'likeable', 'enough', 'grab', 'sympathies', 'never', 'film', 'other', 'point', 'beginning', 'mourn', 'lost', 'childhood', 'just', ""n't"", 'believable', 'flying', 'nowhere', 'retreats', 'quickly', 'leaving', 'least', 'saying', 'Huh', 'films', 'are', 'considered', 'classics', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'achieved', 'such', 'acclaim', 'dark', 'side', 'banal', 'existence', 'so', 'rarely', 'explored', 'American', 'cinema', 'directors', 'previous', 'reputations', 'quality', 'films', 'Allen', 'gone', 'create', 'dozen', 'more', 'great', 'serious', 'films', 'favorite', 'being', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'freshman', 'effort', 'received', 'personal', 'life', 'professionally', 'critical', 'circles', 'much', 'more', 'credit']",N/A
