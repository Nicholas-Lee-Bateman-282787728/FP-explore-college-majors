Besides just being too loud & way too profane, ""The Queens of Comedy"" just wasnt that funny. There was nothing clever or thought-provoking (like ""The Original Kings of Comedy"") about most of the jokes.& I'm sorry but yes I am going to compare the 2 because they are very similar in title, in structure, in content & in set-up. & the ""The Queens of Comedy"" was sort of a sequel & wouldve never happened if it wasn't for ""The Original Kings of Comedy"" being a success in the first place, so how can you not compare the 2?Unfortunately there were way more misses than hits in this one. Toooooo many pointless sex jokes that went a bit far & told more than any person needed or wanted to know. The jokes were either dry, dull & unfunny or shrill, profane & unfunny. By the time Mo'Nique hit the stage w/ her loud-azz, my head was about to explode. She just seemed angry, obnoxious, in a rage, vulgar.....everything but funny. & what was with all the women reffering to themselves & each other as B's??? everything was ""a 'B' this & a 'B' that"". i didnt get that at all, especially coming from 4 sisters who I thought were trying to exude some unity. it was a HUGE step-down from the very funny & talented cast of ""The Orginal Kings of Comedy""!i was thouroughly disapointed by this one & a bit disgusted by the whole thing.

I really enjoy Sommore and Mo'Nique, but this DVD was a let down.  These ladies have no problems discussing just about any topic from spending 5 days in jail, sex, black men, sex, children, sex, marriage, and sex.  You also got some behind the scenes footage, which to me was really not necessary.  I knew better then to compare this to the Kings of Comedy.  I mean why even bother? I knew it would be different, but the titles were similar so I guess that's why people made the comparison.  I have no problem with cussing.  It just seemed extremely excessive, and it was not funny.  That's part of the problem I have with some comics, the use of cussing as a filler to help expand their act.  You don't have to cuss to be funny.  When I could laugh, I enjoyed some of the jokes, but aside of that, it's not gut busting funny.  It's not hysterical.  This was a major, major let down. You do not need to use excessive foul language to be funny!!!",2,Too much cussing takes away from the comedy,1090195200,"07 19, 2004",2004,1033,"['Loud', 'right', 'loud', 'cussing', 'had', 'been', 'wanting', 'see', 'DVD', 'while', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Sommore', ""Mo'Nique"", 'DVD', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'ladies', 'have', 'problems', 'discussing', 'just', 'topic', 'spending', '5', 'days', 'jail', 'sex', 'black', 'men', 'sex', 'children', 'sex', 'marriage', 'sex', 'also', 'got', 'scenes', 'footage', 'was', 'really', 'not', 'necessary', 'knew', 'better', 'then', 'compare', 'Kings', 'Comedy', 'mean', 'why', 'even', 'bother', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'titles', 'were', 'similar', 'so', 'guess', 'why', 'people', 'made', 'comparison', 'have', 'problem', 'cussing', 'just', 'seemed', 'extremely', 'excessive', 'was', 'not', 'funny', 'part', 'problem', 'have', 'comics', 'use', 'cussing', 'filler', 'help', 'expand', 'act', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cuss', 'be', 'funny', 'When', 'could', 'laugh', 'enjoyed', 'jokes', 'aside', 'not', 'gut', 'busting', 'funny', 'not', 'hysterical', 'was', 'major', 'major', 'let', 'down', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'use', 'excessive', 'foul', 'language', 'be', 'funny']",N/A

Maybe I wouldn't have bothered to watch it.When I saw this video coupled with Kings of Comedy as a combo, I was hyped. I went to see the Kings @ the MCI Center in DC and it was all of that. Very entertaning and a whole lot of fun. I loved the King's movie as well. Even having seen a lot of the material at the concert, the movie was great. So when I saw the Queens of Comedy, I am thinking, &quot;Wow, I am going to laugh my heart out.&quot; NOOOOOT. The is a crude, boorish movie. The ladies try and make sex talk funny and do not succeed at all. They come off as comedienne has-beens looking for a cheap laugh. What I found sad was that I have seen all of the ladies work (excl. Ms. Laura) and have been very pleased but this is ridiculous. If there had to be a glimmer (and a small one at that), I would have to give it to Adele and that isn't giving her much. So'more was tired. As a matter of fact, her schtick was so tired, I fell asleep and woke up again for Mo'Nique. I should have continued to sleep.What is an even sadder commentary is that the Kings didn't even resort to the crude humour these broads did. Oh they did their share of cursing and making references to sex but not to the level of tastelessness that these women did. What can I tell you, if you like to hear women talk about their sexcapades @ length and in detail (don't look for humour--there is none), this is your movie. If you want some good, thought out comedy, stick with the Kings.

If nothing else, it shows that the women can be just as raunchy and profane as the fellas. But this DVD lacks much of the sharp-edged wit that made Kings of Comedy such fun. Instead, we have these four ladies (a term I use rather liberally in this review) get onstage and get filthy for the sake of being filthy. Now, I like a little raunch as much as the next guy, but there's very little grace or spark in any of their performances. The concert reaches its nadir when Mo'Nique performs towards the end. I was absolutely stunned to see what a foul brain this rotund beast has.  Somebody get this sister a brillo pad and Ajax to wash that filthy mouth!
