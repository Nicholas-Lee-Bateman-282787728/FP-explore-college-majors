The scenes were so naive that it was laughable. But It is true that I watched in 3 times and I skipped a lot of the scenes so may be there is some plot. The way the actors behave it is as they are in the 19 century of before but I guess that is the way Korean behave in normal life.,2,Probably it is a cultural thing but,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,421,"['was', 'terribleee', 'slow', 'movie', 'sense', 'not', 'moral', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'point', 'story', 'scenes', 'were', 'so', 'naive', 'was', 'laughable', 'true', 'watched', '3', 'times', 'skipped', 'lot', 'scenes', 'so', 'may', 'be', 'plot', 'way', 'actors', 'behave', 'are', '19', 'century', 'guess', 'way', 'Korean', 'behave', 'normal', 'life']",N/A

At first it is cold research, then personal desire to feel another body, then an awakening warmth and pulse, hence her own heart beating.  A woman's exploration of self and identity, not feminist, and without complete liberation.  The female character loses as much as she's gained.  Remarkable award-winning work by director Huh Eun-hee  and late actress Yoo Donh-sook.

However, she badly wants to experience the feeling of sex and lust.  She gets into making porn and falls for her young co-star who falls for her as well- alas, they are not meant to be together.  She sacrifices too much in the end for her experience.I felt like another reviewer- it was a sad story- and I'm a guy- I felt bad for Yoo Dong.  She plays such a sad character who has naughty librarian good looks and is so innocent in the movie even after she is &#34;with&#34; a man.  She's the girl many good guys would love to meet.  It is a slow movie but I couldn't turn it off.  I wanted her to end up happy and fulfilled.I felt so bad at the end that I looked her up on the interweb only to find out that she died of the flu shortly after making this movie- it was released long after her death out of respect.
