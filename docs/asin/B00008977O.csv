While I'm a huge fan of Garth Brooks, George Strait is just as excellent. Unlike Brooks, who was a major showman during his concerts, Strait just gets up there and, without much fanfare, gives a fantastic performance for the audience. It's Captain America without any frills.Thoroughly enjoyable DVD and highly recommended for country music fans.",5,Great country music by a great country artist,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,459,"['When', 'star', 'country', 'music', 'concert', 'horse', 'get', 'sense', ""'re"", 'real', 'country', 'treat', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Garth', 'Brooks', 'George', 'Strait', 'just', 'excellent', 'Brooks', 'who', 'was', 'major', 'showman', 'concerts', 'Strait', 'just', 'up', 'there', 'much', 'fanfare', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'audience', 'Captain', 'America', 'frills.Thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommended', 'country', 'music', 'fans']",George Strait - For the Last Time: Live from the Astrodome

736017,A1THF19PO0LXRD,B00008977O,James Marsh,"[22, 25]","First off, simply the fact that a George Strait concert is available on DVD is very exciting.  I enjoyed every song presented here, and George's performance was excellent.  The video quality of the DVD is good, but not excellent.  I think it must have been shot on video, not film.  The 5.1 audio soundtrack is not very good.  It has way too much crowd noise in the soundtrack, and the fronts don't sound very solid.  You don't get a good sense of vocals in front of you.  They sound a little weak, and lacking in upper range detail.  This was remedied by listening to the 2.0 stereo soundtrack, and putting my receiver in stereo mode.  Much more solid vocals, more powerful and rich sounding.  There is a funny little error with the numbering of the songs on the back.  The numbering is correct up to song 5, but after song 5, track 6 is actually President Bush Sr's. presentation, but it is not counted on the back as being a track.  This means to get to the song listed as being song 6, you have to punch in 7 to actually get to it.  I guess it is song 6, but it is not track 6.  Quirky.  If you have not seen the 1980s VHS tape of a George Strait New Year's Eve show, I highly recommend it.  It is at least as enjoyable as this DVD.",5,"Excellent Performance, Some Flaws in Presentation",1046908800,"03 6, 2003",2003,1236,"['First', 'off', 'simply', 'fact', 'George', 'Strait', 'concert', 'available', 'DVD', 'very', 'exciting', 'enjoyed', 'song', 'presented', 'here', 'George', 'performance', 'was', 'excellent', 'video', 'quality', 'DVD', 'good', 'not', 'excellent', 'think', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'video', 'not', 'film', '5.1', 'audio', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'crowd', 'noise', 'soundtrack', 'fronts', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'very', 'solid', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'good', 'sense', 'vocals', 'front', 'sound', 'little', 'weak', 'lacking', 'upper', 'range', 'detail', 'was', 'remedied', 'listening', '2.0', 'stereo', 'soundtrack', 'putting', 'receiver', 'stereo', 'mode', 'Much', 'more', 'solid', 'vocals', 'more', 'powerful', 'rich', 'sounding', 'funny', 'little', 'error', 'numbering', 'songs', 'back', 'numbering', 'correct', 'song', '5', 'song', '5', 'track', '6', 'actually', 'President', 'Bush', 'Sr', 'presentation', 'not', 'counted', 'back', 'being', 'track', 'get', 'song', 'listed', 'being', 'song', '6', 'have', 'punch', '7', 'actually', 'get', 'guess', 'song', '6', 'not', 'track', '6', 'Quirky', 'have', 'not', 'seen', '1980s', 'VHS', 'tape', 'George', 'Strait', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'show', 'highly', 'recommend', 'least', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'DVD']",George Strait - For the Last Time: Live from the Astrodome

736020,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00008977O,Westley,"[62, 65]","George Strait was given the honor of playing the final concert at the Houston Astrodome in 2002.  He appeared frequently at the Astrodome in the past, so his concert was an emotional occasion for George and his fans.  I've never had the chance to see George in concert, but I really love his music.  Fortunately, this DVD captures him in nice form performing some of his greatest hits.1) Write This Down2) I Can Still Make Cheyenne3) Heartland4) Love Without End, Amen - a real highlight as George dedicates it to former President Bush.5) Check Yes Or No6) The Fireman7) Run8) Murder On Music Row - originally a duet with Alan Jackson, George ably handles it solo.9) The Chair - the crowd really loved this song.10) She'll Leave You With A Smile11) Amarillo By Morning - my all-time favorite George Strait song, and an obvious crowd favorite as well.12) Living and Living Well13) Take Me Back To Tulsa - I wasn't previously familiar with this Texas swing song, which I think was originally recorded by Bob Wills.14) Blue Clear Sky15) The Cowboy Rides Away - a fitting concert endDuring the concert, George mentions that he came down with laryngitis before the concert, and his vocals are sometimes a bit below his normal standard.  However, the opportunity to see George in his only live DVD is well worth the patchy spots.  Former President Bush even presents George with a special award, and George is clearly moved.  Overall, this DVD presents a solid and sometimes emotional concert that is likely to please fans of great, traditional country music.",4,George Live and Strait-Up,1097452800,"10 11, 2004",2004,1553,"['George', 'Strait', 'was', 'given', 'honor', 'playing', 'final', 'concert', 'Houston', 'Astrodome', '2002', 'appeared', 'frequently', 'Astrodome', 'past', 'concert', 'was', 'emotional', 'occasion', 'George', 'fans', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'George', 'concert', 'really', 'love', 'music', 'Fortunately', 'DVD', 'nice', 'form', 'performing', 'greatest', 'hits.1', 'Write', 'Down2', 'Can', 'Still', 'Make', 'Cheyenne3', 'Heartland4', 'Love', 'Without', 'End', 'Amen', 'real', 'highlight', 'George', 'former', 'President', 'Bush.5', 'Check', 'Yes', 'Or', 'No6', 'Fireman7', 'Run8', 'Murder', 'Music', 'Row', 'originally', 'duet', 'Alan', 'Jackson', 'George', 'ably', 'solo.9', 'Chair', 'crowd', 'really', 'loved', 'song.10', ""'ll"", 'Leave', 'A', 'Smile11', 'Amarillo', 'Morning', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'George', 'Strait', 'song', 'obvious', 'crowd', 'favorite', 'well.12', 'Living', 'Living', 'Well13', 'Take', 'Me', 'Back', 'Tulsa', 'was', ""n't"", 'previously', 'familiar', 'Texas', 'swing', 'song', 'think', 'was', 'originally', 'recorded', 'Bob', 'Wills.14', 'Blue', 'Clear', 'Sky15', 'Cowboy', 'Rides', 'Away', 'fitting', 'concert', 'endDuring', 'concert', 'George', 'mentions', 'came', 'down', 'laryngitis', 'concert', 'vocals', 'are', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'normal', 'standard', 'However', 'opportunity', 'see', 'George', 'only', 'live', 'DVD', 'well', 'patchy', 'spots', 'Former', 'President', 'Bush', 'even', 'George', 'special', 'award', 'George', 'clearly', 'moved', 'Overall', 'DVD', 'solid', 'sometimes', 'emotional', 'concert', 'likely', 'please', 'fans', 'great', 'traditional', 'country', 'music']",George Strait - For the Last Time: Live from the Astrodome
