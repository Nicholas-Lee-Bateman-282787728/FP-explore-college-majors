183124,A19UTUEBWKIZFT,1561764442,AKN,"[0, 0]","This man Robert Thurman is so annoying to listen to. In addition he seems to be clueless.He says he studied Buddhism for twenty years before he realized his Buddha knew what he was feeling, meaning that oneness, lack of boundaries between two people. This was a stunning admission, that this took him twenty years, but not a surprising one, given how dense he is about the entire concept of Buddhism. Or maybe it's just that he can't communicate effectively.His constant hand and arm flapping, his glass eye, which, although I appreciate he can't help that he has one, was nonetheless additive to the whole mindless tone of the presentation, and general jerky manner of talking is off putting and doesn't sound to me like someone who has studied Buddhism that long.The glass eye was wide open and staring directly into the camera the entire time,and was very dark, while the other eye was lighter in color, and looking around the room, and squinting. I know how this sounds--insensitive and not politically correct, and yet, it is mentioned here to give an idea of how disappointing this entire presentation was. Along with the slight stutter, stumbling over the words as he reads them from a sheet of paper, the constant flinging of hands and arms, and rambling disconnected generalizations that are completely off the mark, I felt this was a disaster. How odd that someone thought enough of him to hire him as a professor at Columbia!I kept wondering, if indeed he did study Buddhism for decades, what the rest of the Buddhistmonks must have thought of him. To have someone in their midst for that long who is seemingly incapable of getting the most basic concepts, how tolerent they must be!And by studying it does he mean practising it, or just studying it as an observer?I was not feeling for one second as I listened to him that this was someone who graspedthe concepts of Buddhism. He describes Buddha to the rapt young ladies shown smiling at him adoringly in the audience as someone who is ""eternal"", who is ""Godlike"" (big flapping movements of both arms for emphasis. Quick shot of eighteen year old woman with adoring smile.) I can't help but laugh at this. While this isn't the place to try to say what's wrong with this, it is an analogy that is like someone giving a lecture on the coming landing of Curiosity on Mars and describing it as a ""big thing"" as if the audience didn't know that and it's a great explanation of how it works to the uninformed.I had to stop watching this after about half an hour. I couldn't take it any longer than that. I kept hoping for one instant that he would indicate his perception of his subject, but it never happened.",1,Takes indlessness to a new level,1343779200,"08 1, 2012",2012,2667,"['man', 'Robert', 'Thurman', 'so', 'annoying', 'listen', 'addition', 'be', 'clueless.He', 'studied', 'Buddhism', 'twenty', 'years', 'realized', 'Buddha', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'feeling', 'meaning', 'oneness', 'lack', 'boundaries', 'two', 'people', 'was', 'stunning', 'admission', 'took', 'twenty', 'years', 'not', 'surprising', 'one', 'given', 'how', 'dense', 'entire', 'concept', 'Buddhism', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'communicate', 'effectively.His', 'constant', 'hand', 'arm', 'flapping', 'glass', 'eye', 'appreciate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'one', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'additive', 'whole', 'mindless', 'tone', 'presentation', 'general', 'jerky', 'manner', 'talking', 'putting', ""n't"", 'sound', 'someone', 'who', 'studied', 'Buddhism', 'glass', 'eye', 'was', 'wide', 'open', 'staring', 'directly', 'camera', 'entire', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'dark', 'other', 'eye', 'was', 'lighter', 'color', 'looking', 'room', 'squinting', 'know', 'how', 'insensitive', 'not', 'politically', 'correct', 'yet', 'mentioned', 'here', 'give', 'idea', 'how', 'disappointing', 'entire', 'presentation', 'was', 'slight', 'stutter', 'stumbling', 'words', 'sheet', 'paper', 'constant', 'flinging', 'hands', 'arms', 'rambling', 'disconnected', 'generalizations', 'are', 'completely', 'mark', 'felt', 'was', 'disaster', 'How', 'odd', 'someone', 'thought', 'enough', 'hire', 'professor', 'Columbia', 'kept', 'wondering', 'indeed', 'did', 'study', 'Buddhism', 'decades', 'what', 'rest', 'Buddhistmonks', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'have', 'someone', 'midst', 'long', 'who', 'seemingly', 'incapable', 'getting', 'most', 'basic', 'concepts', 'how', 'tolerent', 'must', 'be', 'studying', 'mean', 'practising', 'just', 'studying', 'observer', 'was', 'not', 'feeling', 'one', 'second', 'listened', 'was', 'someone', 'who', 'graspedthe', 'concepts', 'Buddhism', 'Buddha', 'rapt', 'young', 'ladies', 'shown', 'smiling', 'adoringly', 'audience', 'someone', 'who', 'eternal', 'who', 'Godlike', 'big', 'flapping', 'movements', 'arms', 'emphasis', 'Quick', 'shot', 'eighteen', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'adoring', 'smile', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', ""n't"", 'place', 'try', 'say', 'what', 'wrong', 'analogy', 'someone', 'giving', 'lecture', 'coming', 'landing', 'Curiosity', 'Mars', 'describing', 'big', 'thing', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'great', 'explanation', 'how', 'uninformed.I', 'had', 'stop', 'watching', 'hour', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'longer', 'kept', 'hoping', 'one', 'instant', 'would', 'indicate', 'perception', 'subject', 'never', 'happened']",N/A
183125,AFLPMS5K3DZL5,1561764442,calmly,"[9, 17]","This isn't a multimedia presentation. There isn't even a whiteboard. There is some Tibetan art on the walls which are referred to quite infrequently. What you get here is Thurman lecturing, with lots of focus on him. Now and then the audience is shown. At times, the camera lingers on an audience member, usually female, usually young, usually attractive.Thurman talks with his hands, almost always at least one, often both. Once in a while, a hand slips into a pocket, then comes out within ten seconds. Thurman unmistakeably signals in advance (e.g. with a change into a ""silly"" voice) his jokes and some young women respond with giggles. This reminds me a lot of graduate school.So what are you getting with the tapes that a transcript wouldn't give? Well, a chance to see Thurman lecturing, if you've wondered  what he's like. He seemed quite agitated, rather absorbed, somewhat of a character. The contents seemed rather elementary, with the emphasis on the teaching regarding the problems of the self and the related emphasis on reaching out to others, all of course in Buddhist terms.The presentation is not limited to Tibetan Buddhism, which, at any rate, embraces earlier Buddhist teachings. But Thurman appeals to the magic that has been associated with Tibetan Buddhism. One extreme but not isolated example is that, in order to emphasize the power of a Buddha, he claims that if 11 people were locked in a room with only enough air for 10, it would be no problem if one of those people were a Buddha because a Buddha don't need air. Remarkable. I'm not sure what he's aiming at with such statements. Perhaps he feels it is necessary to shake people up a bit to the great potential he believes people have. Hopefully no one suffocates.Science fiction. Virtual reality. Buddhaverses. Infinite this and that. Food fights among enlightened beings each so generous he/she gives away his/her food. Buddhas said to create acres of land frequently. Somehow the theist ""Big Daddy"" is a projection of self-centered people, but unlimited reincarnation is an evolutionary opportunity and doesn't reflect our fear about death. It becomes something of a sermon. In graduate school, the control of grades by professors acted to reduce negative feedback from students and I wonder if Thurman isn't victim of  similar conditions. No one in the audience in these tapes asks a questions, so the giggles and attentive smiles are the key feedback.I wondered whether Thurman is used to dealing only with advanced topics at school and not experienced at giving elementary lectures such as these. Unless watching Thurman is your aim, you may get a great deal more for your money by reading one of Thurman's books - or a book by some other Buddhist writer, many of whom cover key Buddhist themes quite well.",2,Thinking of taking a class with Thurman?,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,2794,"[""n't"", 'multimedia', 'presentation', ""n't"", 'even', 'whiteboard', 'Tibetan', 'art', 'walls', 'are', 'referred', 'quite', 'infrequently', 'What', 'get', 'here', 'Thurman', 'lecturing', 'lots', 'focus', 'Now', 'then', 'audience', 'shown', 'times', 'camera', 'audience', 'member', 'usually', 'female', 'usually', 'young', 'usually', 'attractive.Thurman', 'talks', 'hands', 'almost', 'always', 'least', 'one', 'often', 'Once', 'while', 'hand', 'pocket', 'then', 'out', 'ten', 'seconds', 'Thurman', 'unmistakeably', 'signals', 'advance', 'e.g', 'change', 'silly', 'voice', 'jokes', 'young', 'women', 'respond', 'giggles', 'lot', 'graduate', 'school.So', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'tapes', 'transcript', 'would', ""n't"", 'give', 'Well', 'chance', 'see', 'Thurman', 'lecturing', ""'ve"", 'wondered', 'what', 'seemed', 'quite', 'agitated', 'rather', 'absorbed', 'somewhat', 'character', 'contents', 'seemed', 'rather', 'elementary', 'emphasis', 'teaching', 'regarding', 'problems', 'self', 'related', 'emphasis', 'reaching', 'out', 'others', 'course', 'Buddhist', 'terms.The', 'presentation', 'not', 'limited', 'Tibetan', 'Buddhism', 'rate', 'earlier', 'Buddhist', 'teachings', 'Thurman', 'appeals', 'magic', 'been', 'associated', 'Tibetan', 'Buddhism', 'One', 'extreme', 'not', 'isolated', 'example', 'order', 'emphasize', 'power', 'Buddha', '11', 'people', 'were', 'locked', 'room', 'only', 'enough', 'air', '10', 'would', 'be', 'problem', 'one', 'people', 'were', 'Buddha', 'Buddha', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'air', 'Remarkable', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'aiming', 'such', 'statements', 'Perhaps', 'necessary', 'shake', 'people', 'up', 'bit', 'great', 'potential', 'people', 'have', 'Hopefully', 'one', 'suffocates.Science', 'fiction', 'Virtual', 'reality', 'Buddhaverses', 'Infinite', 'Food', 'fights', 'enlightened', 'beings', 'so', 'generous', 'he/she', 'away', 'his/her', 'food', 'Buddhas', 'said', 'create', 'acres', 'land', 'frequently', 'Somehow', 'theist', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'projection', 'self-centered', 'people', 'unlimited', 'reincarnation', 'evolutionary', 'opportunity', ""n't"", 'reflect', 'fear', 'death', 'something', 'sermon', 'graduate', 'school', 'control', 'grades', 'professors', 'acted', 'reduce', 'negative', 'feedback', 'students', 'wonder', 'Thurman', ""n't"", 'victim', 'similar', 'conditions', 'one', 'audience', 'tapes', 'questions', 'giggles', 'attentive', 'smiles', 'are', 'key', 'feedback.I', 'wondered', 'Thurman', 'used', 'dealing', 'only', 'advanced', 'topics', 'school', 'not', 'experienced', 'giving', 'elementary', 'lectures', 'such', 'watching', 'Thurman', 'aim', 'may', 'get', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'money', 'reading', 'one', 'Thurman', 'books', 'book', 'other', 'Buddhist', 'writer', 'many', 'whom', 'cover', 'key', 'Buddhist', 'themes', 'quite', 'well']",N/A

The Thurman DVD lectures gave me an understanding of Buddhism that I was unable to get from books.  Thurman provided an enthusiasm and transmitted a personal involvement by his tone of voice and mannerisms.  These sorts of things aren't easily communicated by books.I agree with many of the complaints others have cited.  (I especially enjoyed the ""Thinking of Taking a Class with Thurman?"" review.) Why, for example, was there no onscreen text?  It appears that not much effort went into producing the video.Nonetheless I'm grateful for the warmth of Thurman's presentation and for the new perspective that I gained from viewing the lecture - a perspective that I had missed in my readings.",4,Helpful Orientation,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,785,"['broad', 'subject', 'Buddhism', 'get', 'information', 'variety', 'sources', 'Thurman', 'DVD', 'lectures', 'gave', 'understanding', 'Buddhism', 'was', 'unable', 'get', 'books', 'Thurman', 'provided', 'enthusiasm', 'transmitted', 'personal', 'involvement', 'tone', 'voice', 'mannerisms', 'sorts', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'easily', 'communicated', 'books.I', 'agree', 'many', 'complaints', 'others', 'have', 'cited', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'Thinking', 'Taking', 'Class', 'Thurman', 'review', 'Why', 'example', 'was', 'onscreen', 'text', 'not', 'much', 'effort', 'went', 'producing', 'video.Nonetheless', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'warmth', 'Thurman', 'presentation', 'new', 'perspective', 'gained', 'viewing', 'lecture', 'perspective', 'had', 'missed', 'readings']",N/A

Each tape is a lecture given by Robert A. F. Thurman at the Tibet House in New York.  Excepting the occasional shot of the audience, each video is 70 minutes of his lecturing.This is not necessarily a bad thing.  Thurman is an entertaining speaker and does a great job in explaining some of the mystical aspects and philosophy.  He is very good at relating to the audience.  After viewing them, I do feel that I have a better grasp of main tenets.This does not appear to be scripted.  For instance, in tape two, he mentions that he will discuss the Four Noble Truths, the three wheels, and the three vehicles.  He goes in depth on the truths and the first two wheels, but then seems to realize that he is running out of time so rushes through the last four.  There is still good information, but I wished that these last ideas had the same kind of detailed explanation.I would recommend this to anyone wanting to understand more about Buddhism.",4,A good explanation,1016150400,"03 15, 2002",2002,1064,"['series', 'three', 'videotapes', 'cover', 'three', 'aspects', 'Buddhism', 'Buddha', 'Dharma', 'Sangha', 'tape', 'lecture', 'given', 'Robert', 'A.', 'F.', 'Thurman', 'Tibet', 'House', 'New', 'York', 'Excepting', 'occasional', 'shot', 'audience', 'video', '70', 'minutes', 'lecturing.This', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'Thurman', 'entertaining', 'speaker', 'great', 'job', 'explaining', 'mystical', 'aspects', 'philosophy', 'very', 'good', 'relating', 'audience', 'viewing', 'do', 'feel', 'have', 'better', 'grasp', 'main', 'tenets.This', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'scripted', 'instance', 'tape', 'two', 'will', 'discuss', 'Four', 'Noble', 'Truths', 'three', 'wheels', 'three', 'vehicles', 'depth', 'truths', 'first', 'two', 'wheels', 'then', 'realize', 'running', 'time', 'rushes', 'last', 'four', 'still', 'good', 'information', 'wished', 'last', 'ideas', 'had', 'same', 'kind', 'detailed', 'explanation.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'understand', 'more', 'Buddhism']",N/A

The second and third ramble on, punctuated by irrelevances and Thurman sometimes to the consternation of the the audience showing that he knows the jargon in foreign tongues. Also, some of the ideas he presents are contradicted by other 'authorities' I have encountered. No attempt is made at those times to indicate that there are other 'facts' and/or interpretations of the facts.In the second and third lecture he prompts the audience several times for their understanding, which is a sure sign that at ;least subliminally he knows he has lost them. Living in Japan for the last 25 years I have done some investigation of Buddhism and Thurman's ideas are not always acceptable. Finally, he takes pejorative swipes at other religions from time to time. How about showing a little of that Buddhist compassion?Save your money and by one of the good books that are currently available.
