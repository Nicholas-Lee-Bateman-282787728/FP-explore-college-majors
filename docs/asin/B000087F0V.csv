734476,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000087F0V,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[4, 6]","Skins is director Chris Eyre's follow up to the 1997 Native American film Smoke Signals. Like the first film Skins is a comedy drama that has moments, and is a sound film, but could have done a bit more, and often settles into PC preachiness. One would have hoped Eyre would have matured as a filmmaker in the interim. The main character is Rudy Yellow Lodge (Eric Schweig), a reservation cop on the Pine Ridge Reservation for Oglala Sioux in the Black Hills of South Dakota. He is dissatisfied with his job and life, and even more so with his older brother Mogie (Graham Greene), a stereotypical lazy and drunken Indian, who is a source of embarrassment for Rudy. He is also a Vietnam veteran, haunted by that war, and unable to take care of his teenaged son Herby (Noah Watts). After some violence directed against the tribe Rudy snaps and becomes a vigilante, first brutalizing two teenagers responsible for an attack on another boy, and then setting ablaze a local liquor store he blames for the Rez's woes. Unfortunately, Mogie happens to be sleeping off a drinking binge after breaking into the store, and is severely scarred by the fire, which guts into Rudy. While at the hospital for his fire recovery it's discovered that Mogie has a terminal liver disease. Rudy, in his guilt, decides to live out a foolish act of vandalism, once Mogie dies, as a penance.Overall, the film is solid, but there are times when the lighting and set up of scenes feels very amateurish. The story is rather banal, and dull, but Schweig and Greene, as the brothers, almost make up for that, and Greene is that rare actor who can both play a stereotype and subvert it. Schweig, as Rudy, is also very good, although no credible reason for his mental break is given. The scenes of the men's youth is a place where more could have been fleshed out, and a focus on the brothers, and Mogie and his son, would have been far more effective than Rudy's break. There is also a wasted romance between Rudy and Stella, played by the beautiful Michelle Thrush- an actress who can say more in a silent glance than many can in a two minute monologue. Yet, despite these positives, the film is a bit of a dud. Hopefully, in whatever his third project is, Chris Eyre can put all the wonderful little parts, moments, and performances into a tour de force.",2,Disappointing,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,2325,"['Skins', 'director', 'Chris', 'Eyre', 'follow', 'up', '1997', 'Native', 'American', 'film', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'first', 'film', 'Skins', 'comedy', 'drama', 'moments', 'sound', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'bit', 'more', 'often', 'PC', 'preachiness', 'One', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'Eyre', 'would', 'have', 'matured', 'filmmaker', 'interim', 'main', 'character', 'Rudy', 'Yellow', 'Lodge', 'Eric', 'Schweig', 'reservation', 'cop', 'Pine', 'Ridge', 'Reservation', 'Oglala', 'Sioux', 'Black', 'Hills', 'South', 'Dakota', 'dissatisfied', 'job', 'life', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'older', 'brother', 'Mogie', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'stereotypical', 'lazy', 'drunken', 'Indian', 'who', 'source', 'embarrassment', 'Rudy', 'also', 'Vietnam', 'veteran', 'haunted', 'war', 'unable', 'take', 'care', 'teenaged', 'son', 'Herby', 'Noah', 'Watts', 'violence', 'directed', 'tribe', 'Rudy', 'snaps', 'vigilante', 'first', 'brutalizing', 'two', 'teenagers', 'responsible', 'attack', 'boy', 'then', 'setting', 'ablaze', 'local', 'liquor', 'store', 'Rez', 'woes', 'Unfortunately', 'Mogie', 'be', 'sleeping', 'off', 'drinking', 'binge', 'breaking', 'store', 'severely', 'scarred', 'fire', 'Rudy', 'hospital', 'fire', 'recovery', 'discovered', 'Mogie', 'terminal', 'liver', 'disease', 'Rudy', 'guilt', 'live', 'out', 'foolish', 'act', 'vandalism', 'once', 'Mogie', 'dies', 'penance.Overall', 'film', 'solid', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'lighting', 'set', 'up', 'scenes', 'feels', 'very', 'amateurish', 'story', 'rather', 'banal', 'dull', 'Schweig', 'Greene', 'brothers', 'almost', 'make', 'up', 'Greene', 'rare', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'stereotype', 'subvert', 'Schweig', 'Rudy', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'credible', 'reason', 'mental', 'break', 'given', 'scenes', 'men', 'youth', 'place', 'where', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'focus', 'brothers', 'Mogie', 'son', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'Rudy', 'break', 'also', 'wasted', 'romance', 'Rudy', 'Stella', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Michelle', 'Thrush-', 'actress', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'more', 'silent', 'glance', 'many', 'can', 'two', 'minute', 'monologue', 'positives', 'film', 'bit', 'dud', 'Hopefully', 'third', 'project', 'Chris', 'Eyre', 'can', 'put', 'wonderful', 'little', 'parts', 'moments', 'performances', 'tour', 'force']",Skins VHS

734480,ADS5APY1NKTL4,B000087F0V,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[6, 7]","I must have seen this film (at least) four years ago.  I loved it then, and, upon recalling the plot, still appreciate the power and intensity it presented to us, through its depiction of the turbulence and pain of the Plains Indian experience on the ""rez"" (reservation).  Rudy Yellow Lodge (Eric Schweig), a man employed to uphold honor and accountablity, snaps in the face of his brother, Mogie (Graham Greene)'s alcoholism and the desolate existence of his fellow residents.  In defiance, Rudy decides to take part in random acts of violence (beating a white supremacist, destroying a liquor store in a fiery act of arson, fueled by anger).  Though, Rudy's original intention is to take a bold (but violent) stand against the multitudes of injustice laid on the heads and hearts of his Native brothers on sisters, his plan backfires on him.Director Chris Eyre (SMOKE SIGNALS) boldly directs this film and takes us all on a gothic, violent and very disturbing journey down the path of anger, oppression and (attempted) redemption.  I really got a sense of the rage blazing behind the camera (in the director's chair) as I did in the eyes of the actors who so masterfully portrayed such powerful and disturbed characters.  SKINS challenges the stereotype (and stigma) of alcoholism in the Native American community, as well as everyday racism that occurs as easily as breathing in and out.  Eyre's unflinching account of these experiences is beautiful and heartbreaking.  Watch SKINS purely for the reason that not enough people have heard of the film (but ought to).

734484,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B000087F0V,Jeffrey Leach,"[38, 41]","Shortly after receiving my driver's license I decided to take a road trip through Nebraska. At one point in my journey I suddenly noticed Indians everywhere--driving down the road, sitting in parking lots off the state highway, and standing in front of decrepit looking buildings. &quot;What's going on here?&quot; I said to myself, not knowing at the time that I was cruising through the Winnebago reservation in Northern Nebraska. I always tell this story to friends nowadays, especially ones who champion Native American rights, and it never fails to get a laugh. Why? Because they know most of us rarely encounter Indians, let alone spend any time on reservations. Out here in the Midwest, you will still meet Native Americans from time to time outside of reservations. If you live on the East or West Coast of the United States, however, you probably have little interaction with Indians. Oh, you might have seen one on a college campus, or know someone who knows someone who has some &quot;Indian blood&quot; flowing through their veins, but most Americans have only seen Indians in old photographs or on television. In short, we have little idea about the plight of the modern day Native American. That's why a movie like &quot;Skins&quot; is an important piece of cinema that all of us should watch.&quot;Skins&quot; focuses on two brothers living on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota, just down the road from Mount Rushmore. Pine Ridge is the poorest county in the United States, rife with chronic alcoholism, high infant mortality rates, sky-high unemployment, and low life expectancies. It's a rough place to live and raise a family, a fact Pine Ridge police officer Rudy Yellow Lodge learns anew everyday as he deals with murders, assaults, rapes, and other alcohol and poverty induced rampages. When he isn't fulfilling his duties, he's attempting to deal with his alcoholic older brother Mogie, a Vietnam veteran who always likes to stir up some trouble on the reservation. But Rudy has more problems than putting up with his brother. The police officer is sick to his soul about the abhorrent conditions on the reservation, and one day he decides to do something about it. What Yellow Lodge does is perhaps a series of small gestures, merely a drop of remedy in an ocean of social sickness, but he feels it is good for his sanity and good for his people.What Rudy does is turn vigilante. The idea comes to him after he falls and hits his head on a rock while pursuing a fugitive in a murder case. From this point forward, Yellow Lodge wreaks havoc on Lakotas who assault their fellow Lakotas. He beats two youths with a baseball bat, breaking their knees in the process, after he learns about their involvement in a heinous crime. A bigger mission concerns the liquor stores in Whiteclay, Nebraska. Since alcohol sales on the reservation are a big no-no, Indians drive down to Whiteclay to buy their poison. Yellow Lodge rapidly tires of seeing his people buy booze at the stores, so he decides to torch one of the businesses in the middle of the night. Like I said, it's a small gesture that won't mean much in the long run (other stores will open for business in the morning as sure as the sun rises), but taking an extreme action makes Rudy feel good about himself. After all, he's a cop sworn &quot;to serve and protect&quot; his people, and what better way to fulfill this promise than to strike a blow against the individuals who make his people's lives miserable. There's a problem with Rudy's willful actions, though. For one thing, they don't entirely embody Lakota virtues. Also, even the best actions have a tendency to hurt the ones we love, and the results of the fire at the liquor store nearly destroy Rudy Yellow Lodge's life.The performances in &quot;Skins&quot; are excellent. Director Chris Eyre assembled a largely Indian cast for his film, and they all do a good job. Eric Schweig works wonders as the emotionally conflicted Rudy Yellow Lodge. He's so riveting to watch that you immediately feel an empathy with his character even when the guy does some bad things. For the role of Mogie, Eyre cast none other than Graham Greene. A character that is a raging alcoholic with a serious authority problem might not be the easiest role to pull off, but Greene does it with an effortlessness that is startling to watch. Both of these characters move against the backdrop of a reservation clogged with run down houses and shacks, rutted roads, and broken lives. If you think everything is doom and gloom in &quot;Skins,&quot; however, you're wrong. Eyre injects the film with an enormous amount of humor, which might come as a surprise. Many people don't associate Native Americans with a sense of humor because they've seen old black and white photos of stone faced Indians awkwardly posing for the camera. &quot;Skins&quot; shows that Indians use humor in part to cope with their difficulties.It is difficult to watch &quot;Skins&quot; and not feel pity for the residents of Pine Ridge, but Eyre is attempting something more with his picture. Instead of trying to get us to feel sorry for the Lakotas, he wants his audience to know about their problems and how Lakotas live their lives in spite of them. I applaud Chris Eyre for gracing us with this amazingly insightful film about a world far too few of us know about. &quot;Skins&quot; is fascinating, funny, thought provoking, and even--surprise--entertaining.

Warrant ""JPW""","[18, 18]","I recently saw this film and must say that it has become one of my all-time favorite movies, solely for the realisitic portrayal it gives of today's reservations.Contrary to the report given by an earlier reviewer, Pine Ridge is in SOUTH Dakota, not North.  I grew up in South Dakota nearly all my life, and I taught at an Indian school. I saw, sometimes first hand, what the reservation life entailed, and it was depressing.  This movie does a good job of encompassing one of the reservation's most prevalent threats at this time:  alcoholism.I've been a fan of Graham Greene ever since Dances With Wolves, although I don't consider that movie a stellar example of historically accurate film making.For the past few years, I've read about the debate regarding the liquor stores in White Clay,  NE.  Although I realize that those people may be making a tidy profit off the Indians in Pine Ridge, people must realize that alcoholics will drive ANY distance to get their booze -- White Clay and further.  You cannot blame the store owners for providing the booze.  You're blaming the wrong people.For those who don't see the significance of the bear trap scene:  I think it is a statement about the current climate of the reservations, the way native people turn against each other in today's depressing reservations.  The alcoholism has brought in crime and distrust among the people of the reservations, and it's startling to see the decline.I gave this film 4 out of 5 stars only because I found the scenes with the main character (Eric Schweig) having an affair as distracting and not relevant.  It seems to me as if there should have been more to that story, but there wasn't.All in all, I would highly recommend this story to anyone interested in Native American history, or in the history of the United States in general.",4,A very revealing film,1059955200,"08 4, 2003",2003,1826,"['recently', 'saw', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'become', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'solely', 'realisitic', 'portrayal', 'today', 'reservations.Contrary', 'report', 'given', 'earlier', 'reviewer', 'Pine', 'Ridge', 'SOUTH', 'Dakota', 'not', 'North', 'grew', 'up', 'South', 'Dakota', 'nearly', 'life', 'taught', 'Indian', 'school', 'saw', 'sometimes', 'first', 'hand', 'what', 'reservation', 'life', 'entailed', 'was', 'depressing', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'encompassing', 'one', 'reservation', 'most', 'prevalent', 'threats', 'time', 'alcoholism.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'ever', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'movie', 'stellar', 'example', 'historically', 'accurate', 'film', 'making.For', 'past', 'few', 'years', ""'ve"", 'read', 'debate', 'regarding', 'liquor', 'stores', 'White', 'Clay', 'NE', 'realize', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'making', 'tidy', 'profit', 'Indians', 'Pine', 'Ridge', 'people', 'must', 'realize', 'alcoholics', 'will', 'drive', 'ANY', 'distance', 'get', 'booze', 'White', 'Clay', 'further', 'can', 'not', 'blame', 'store', 'owners', 'providing', 'booze', ""'re"", 'blaming', 'wrong', 'people.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'significance', 'bear', 'trap', 'scene', 'think', 'statement', 'current', 'climate', 'reservations', 'way', 'native', 'people', 'turn', 'other', 'today', 'depressing', 'reservations', 'alcoholism', 'brought', 'crime', 'distrust', 'people', 'reservations', 'startling', 'see', 'decline.I', 'gave', 'film', '4', '5', 'stars', 'only', 'found', 'scenes', 'main', 'character', 'Eric', 'Schweig', 'having', 'affair', 'distracting', 'not', 'relevant', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'story', 'there', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'story', 'anyone', 'interested', 'Native', 'American', 'history', 'history', 'United', 'States', 'general']",Skins VHS

Still a fine looking fellow after all these years. Here is where my emotions get tangled - the reservation life. Anger at what's been done to natives and anger at what natives are doing to themselves and the blasted liquor stores. And then, truly angry at my own self-absorption and apathy. All right, that's what bothers me most.This isn't a perfect movie. It skims story lines too frequently and doesn't offer enough food for thought on some of the characters' actions. Yes, Rudy is in an emotional dilemma. He's a decent and responsible person - except for the married lady that's not addressed well or concluded at all, in my opinion. He's feeling disgusted and frustrated by the very people that need him the most, if not for his example of how to live but for the inner strength and resolve that they seem to lack. Stinks to be Rudy. I'm just not sure all this would be enough for him to take up his nightly hobby.Graham ('52) and Schweig ('67) could be brothers but when they're shown as kids, the two are only about 2 years apart.

734490,A7C8W2504P1H2,B000087F0V,Laurie,"[6, 12]","Sorry, but I have to disagree with all these high ratings. I was extremely disappointed with this movie and I am still even a bit depressed by it.The acting is good, the setting is marvelous and the story is real  -- but only real if you're fine with protagonists who represent the lowest common denominator in human moral experience.Rudy Yellow Lodge, the main character, looks like a pretty good guy on the surface. He's a cop. He's intelligent, clean cut, articulate and serious about his work. However, his way of handling his rage is that he goes around at night in blackface and a stocking cap engaged in helpful public services -- breaking some teenager's kneecaps with a baseball bat, torching a liquor store and vandalizing Mt. Rushmore with oil paint. That's the sort of thing he likes to do when he's not busy enabling his alcoholic brother and sleeping with his married girlfriend. What's up with that? I read somewhere that the Sioux are traditionally very family-oriented people, but if this movie was my only source of information, I'd have a very different impression.Not only is Rudy the worst kind of violent criminal -- a cop with no respect for the law -- he's also almost completely remorseless. The kids he sends to the hospital for broken knees confess their actual crime (yes, they murdered someone). All he cares about when he interviews them is: Do they know who messed them up? In other words, do they have ID on him and is he going to jail yet? A brave Lakota warrior in the making.Then, rather than acknowledge to himself that he is creating a lot of pain in people's lives, he attributes many of the tragic consequences of his acts to the contributions of Iktomi, the trickster spirit in Lakota spiritual beliefs. That is because he keeps seeing little spiders. Rudy goes to a sweat lodge to see if he can clear Iktomi out of his life, but do you think that he ever considers, for one minute, changing the hostile and illegal course of his life? Nah.In case you're in doubt about the real theme of this movie, listen closely. It's repeated two or three times and it goes something like this: whatever happens in this life, we have no control. We're completely at the mercy of unseen forces. Right.The clincher is that his brother Mogie, who rarely takes anything seriously, has written Rudy a very long letter on his deathbed, asking him to take good care of his son, because Rudy is the only GOOD role model the kid has. Oh his way back to the Rez, after dumping oil paint on Rushmore, what do you think Rudy sees? It's his 18 year old, handsome nephew trying to thumb a ride out of town! Do you think he turns around, to at least give this kid a lift so he doesn't end up facedown in a ditch somewhere? Heck no! He laughs and drives away!Wow!Even though I totally understand the defacing of Mt. Rushmore, and I  understand the appalling poverty depicted in all its truth in this film, I think the Oglala Sioux were very unfavorably portrayed by Chris Eyre. If I were Native American, I'd be asking Eyre to chose another profession quickly -- or at least another subject! And all this time I thought the Cheyenne and the Sioux got along together very well .... What a rotten movie, and what a disgusting portrayal of sadly overlooked and under-represented minority in this country!For once, how about a movie that depicts GOOD pepole who are also Native? That is what they always used to say about the westerns with whooping hostiles scalping everybody. I never thought I'd have to make that complaint about an N.A. producer filming on a real reservation in the 21st century.

As with the older Powwow Highway and Smoke Signals (also directed by Eyre), two men with opposite personalities grate and grind against each other during the course of a story that informs the viewer of another North America, seldom seen and often forgotten. Graham Greene portrays a war veteran who blunts pain and rage at social ills with alcohol. He plays the role well enough to open a dark pit in the stomach of the viewer who roots for him to get well, but like many family members in similar situations, can only helplessly watch the downward spiral from the sidelines to its heartbreaking conclusion. Eric Schweig portrays the younger brother who stands in for the audience, watching his older brother kill himself softly, then taking vigilante justice against an economic and social system that doesn't care or doesn't mind suffering. At the core of the story is the relationship between the two brothers, how like most siblings they can easily point out each others failings, but at the same time, recognize the best in each other as no outsider can.

The camera brings us into the dilapidated homes and shows us the barren terrain.  And the Director, Chris Eyre, has wisely chosen an all-Native cast.  Don't be fooled by their Anglican sounding names.  They're all Indians, either from America or Canada.The story is about two brothers in their late forties.  One is a cop and the other is a burnt-out alcoholic who sometimes thinks he's still in Vietnam.  Flashbacks show their abusive childhood and their dependence on one another.  The storyline shows us how Eric Schweig, cast as the cop brother, helps his brother over and over again.  Graham Greene is cast as the alcoholic and even though we see him mostly drunk and creating chaos for everyone, get to know him as a real person with hopes and dreams and missteps along the way.We learn about life on the reservation and the history of the massacre at Wounded Knee.  And we also learn why the Mt.  Rushmore carving of the four American presidents is so upsetting to the Indians who see rocks as sacred.  As the story moves along, we see the cop brother become a vigilante and solve a murder investigation.  Later, he sets a liquor store on fire.  When his brother is burned in the fire, the story comes to a pivotal point and we get a glimpse of the unwavering love of the brothers for each other and the sense of family in the entire community.This is a thoughtful movie that's a bit uncomfortable to watch.

Rushmore.  The Wounded Knee Massacre took place nearby and this reservation is more or less emblematic of the suffering of the American Indians (or Native Americans, if that is what you prefer).  The poverty -- discussed in documentary clips and shown in the film's story line -- is mind-boggling.  I found myself wondering how could this be and why isn't someone marching on Washington about this?  Unable to find jobs in this desolate part of the plains, many turn to alcohol, and the alcohol leads to violence and illness.And that is the subject of the film.  There are two main characters -- brothers.  One has become a policeman and more or less has his life together, although he is unmarried and has no children, and he may not be as together as he outwardly seems. The other brother (Graham Greene) is a full-blown non-functioning alcoholic -- a pathetic man in many ways, but also oddly gentle and loved by his family.Both brothers are reacting, each in his own way, to life on the reservation -- not a terrible place in terms of community, but a place with tremendous social problems rooted in poverty, alcoholism, and cultural issues.  Anger is a significant theme throughout the film, but it's a simmering anger, exemplified by caustic comments about Mt. Rushmore -- four white American presidents carved out of the sacred rock of the Black Hills.The acting is amazing and the film is riveting.  Despite the serious subject matter, I wouldn't describe the film as really depressing, in part because of the good humor and the warmth that manages to survive the conditions.This is a film worth owning.",5,This is a movie that will stay with me for a long time,1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,1840,"['Graham', 'Greene', 'amazing', 'actor', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'remember', 'was', 'actor', 'playing', 'part', 'not', 'character', 'himself.This', 'film', 'set', 'Pine', 'Ridge', 'Indian', 'Reservation', 'southern', 'South', 'Dakota', 'Mt', 'Rushmore', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'Massacre', 'took', 'place', 'nearby', 'reservation', 'more', 'less', 'emblematic', 'suffering', 'American', 'Indians', 'Native', 'Americans', 'what', 'prefer', 'poverty', 'discussed', 'documentary', 'clips', 'shown', 'film', 'story', 'line', 'mind-boggling', 'found', 'wondering', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'why', ""n't"", 'someone', 'marching', 'Washington', 'Unable', 'find', 'jobs', 'desolate', 'part', 'plains', 'many', 'turn', 'alcohol', 'alcohol', 'violence', 'illness.And', 'subject', 'film', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'brothers', 'One', 'become', 'policeman', 'more', 'less', 'life', 'together', 'unmarried', 'children', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'together', 'outwardly', 'other', 'brother', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'full-blown', 'non-functioning', 'alcoholic', 'pathetic', 'man', 'many', 'ways', 'also', 'oddly', 'gentle', 'loved', 'family.Both', 'brothers', 'are', 'reacting', 'own', 'way', 'life', 'reservation', 'not', 'terrible', 'place', 'terms', 'community', 'place', 'tremendous', 'social', 'problems', 'rooted', 'poverty', 'alcoholism', 'cultural', 'issues', 'Anger', 'significant', 'theme', 'film', 'simmering', 'anger', 'exemplified', 'caustic', 'comments', 'Mt', 'Rushmore', 'four', 'white', 'American', 'presidents', 'carved', 'sacred', 'rock', 'Black', 'Hills.The', 'acting', 'amazing', 'film', 'riveting', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'would', ""n't"", 'describe', 'film', 'really', 'depressing', 'part', 'good', 'humor', 'warmth', 'survive', 'conditions.This', 'film', 'owning']",Skins VHS

Pine Ridge is in the shadow of Mount Rushmore and Wounded Knee is part of the preserve.  There are no 'set pieces' on this reservation.  Yes, it looks like a Third World Country, because that is precisely what it is.  Listen to the statistics at the front of this movie.The story is old as time.  Two brothers, Mogie (Greene), the fallen warrior didn't come back quite right from Vietnam.  Wounded three times, he spends his time drinking away the memories, but he's still kept his love of family and sense of humor. The younger brother Rudy (Schweig) is a reservation cop and a vigilante. When Rudy tries to help the res by burning a white-owned liquor store on US lands, he ends up accidentally injuring his brother.The story's told with stark detail and empathy by Chris Eyre (Smoke Signals) who is also a Native American--as are most of the cast and crew.  The writer, Adrian C. Lewis, is also a Native American who believed the story needed to be told.Don't stop watching at the end of the film.

734503,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B000087F0V,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[59, 59]","Native American director Chris Eyre has created another excellent film about life on the reservation, told from the Indian point of view. Other reviews here represent the content of the film well, its story line involving two brothers and its social commentary, exposing the impact of poverty and alcoholism on the Lakota Sioux descendants of Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse.The movie, however, provides only a partial view of the book it's based on by Indian writer, Adrian Louis. His novel, ""Skins,"" has enough material for a 10-part miniseries. It immerses the reader in the deeper complexities of its subject matter, exploring the dimensions of its characters more thoroughly (and with darker humor) and conveying a great deal more about life on the reservation, with its compelling mix of Indian and white cultures and the resulting ambiguities, competing world views, and conflicted values. It is significant that Iktomi, the trickster spirit and shape-shifter, is a central theme in both novel and film, for appearance and reality, wisdom and stupidity, pride and shame, love and rage are all in a continuing dance for dominance.Rudy, the Indian cop, portrays these confusing conflicts beautifully, representing both the law in his tribal police uniform and vigilante justice in his blackface and pantyhose mask. The author's book explores other dimensions of Rudy's confusion by letting us learn more about his relationships with women. In the novel he is married and estranged from his wife, and we follow the rocky ups and downs of his growing attraction to his cousin's wife, Stella, while he carries on with other men's wives as well. Afflicted with hypertension, he takes meds that affect his sexual performance, and much of the novel traces the rising and falling cycles of his libido, all of which are unpredictable and seemingly under the spell of Iktomi. Finally, while the film makes clear the love that bonds Rudy to his brother Mogie, the depth of that love comes across more strongly in the novel, as well as the demons that haunt Mogie and produce brotherly conflict.See the movie first, so you can more easily visualize the world that Adrian Louis describes and enjoy the wonderful performances of Eric Schweig and Graham Greene. Then read the book and allow yourself to know this subject and comprehend the Lakota culture more deeply. The ending, involving Mt. Rushmore, which is given an abruptly abbreviated treatment in the movie, will also make a lot more sense.",5,Excellent movie . . . but read the book,1099612800,"11 5, 2004",2004,2487,"['Native', 'American', 'director', 'Chris', 'Eyre', 'created', 'excellent', 'film', 'life', 'reservation', 'told', 'Indian', 'point', 'view', 'Other', 'reviews', 'here', 'represent', 'content', 'film', 'well', 'story', 'line', 'involving', 'two', 'brothers', 'social', 'commentary', 'exposing', 'impact', 'poverty', 'alcoholism', 'Lakota', 'Sioux', 'descendants', 'Sitting', 'Bull', 'Crazy', 'Horse.The', 'movie', 'however', 'only', 'partial', 'view', 'book', 'based', 'Indian', 'writer', 'Adrian', 'Louis', 'novel', 'Skins', 'enough', 'material', '10-part', 'miniseries', 'reader', 'deeper', 'complexities', 'subject', 'matter', 'exploring', 'dimensions', 'characters', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'darker', 'humor', 'conveying', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'life', 'reservation', 'compelling', 'mix', 'Indian', 'white', 'cultures', 'resulting', 'ambiguities', 'competing', 'world', 'views', 'conflicted', 'values', 'significant', 'Iktomi', 'trickster', 'spirit', 'shape-shifter', 'central', 'theme', 'novel', 'film', 'appearance', 'reality', 'wisdom', 'stupidity', 'pride', 'shame', 'love', 'rage', 'are', 'continuing', 'dance', 'dominance.Rudy', 'Indian', 'cop', 'confusing', 'conflicts', 'beautifully', 'representing', 'law', 'tribal', 'police', 'uniform', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'blackface', 'pantyhose', 'mask', 'author', 'book', 'other', 'dimensions', 'Rudy', 'confusion', 'letting', 'learn', 'more', 'relationships', 'women', 'novel', 'married', 'estranged', 'wife', 'follow', 'rocky', 'ups', 'downs', 'growing', 'attraction', 'cousin', 'wife', 'Stella', 'other', 'men', 'wives', 'as', 'well', 'Afflicted', 'hypertension', 'meds', 'affect', 'sexual', 'performance', 'much', 'novel', 'traces', 'rising', 'falling', 'cycles', 'libido', 'are', 'unpredictable', 'seemingly', 'spell', 'Iktomi', 'Finally', 'film', 'clear', 'love', 'bonds', 'Rudy', 'brother', 'Mogie', 'depth', 'love', 'more', 'strongly', 'novel', 'as', 'well', 'demons', 'haunt', 'Mogie', 'produce', 'brotherly', 'conflict.See', 'movie', 'first', 'can', 'more', 'easily', 'visualize', 'world', 'Adrian', 'Louis', 'describes', 'enjoy', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Eric', 'Schweig', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Then', 'read', 'book', 'allow', 'know', 'subject', 'comprehend', 'Lakota', 'culture', 'more', 'deeply', 'ending', 'involving', 'Mt', 'Rushmore', 'given', 'abruptly', 'abbreviated', 'treatment', 'movie', 'will', 'also', 'make', 'lot', 'more', 'sense']",Skins VHS

734505,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000087F0V,Samuel McKewon,"[7, 11]","My thoughts are torn over ""Skins,"" one of the few films to chronicle the sad, wasted lives of Native Americans and the bloody history that has informed the misfortunes of nearly an entire culture.Directed by Chris Eyre, the movie undeniably has powerful scenes, not the least of which is the closing image, which involves a debasement of Mount Rushmore.For me, the lasting image from ""Skins"" is the sight of a local (Gary Farmer) killed by a bear trap set by neighbors. A disbelieving reservation cop (Eric Schwieg) wants an explanation for it -- the bear trap, why nobody answered the obvious calls for help -- and there is none. Not plausible, anyway. So many of the Natives' problems have their roots in something, whether it be a history of abuse or lack of opportunities, but they do not justify much of the mindlessness that has invaded the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.Eyre knows that, and to prove his point he makes that cop, Rudy Yellow Lodge, a vigilante who beats criminals and burns down Nebraska liquor shops in his off hours. His efforts, essentially, are just as fruitless as anything else: The drunks still get drunk, the reservation remains mostly hopeless, and the brutal past cannot be changed.Which brings me to the other side of my thoughts: ""Skins,"" while powerful, is poorly made. The editing, the documentary-style camerawork, some of the acting -- it's simply left wanting. Given the subject matter on the table, the absolute dead-in-the-eye importance of it, it probably sounds like quibbling to criticize production values. Nevertheless, I mention it, because it stands in the way of a better film. You look at ""The Fast Runner,"" an amazing achievement shot on a similar small budget in far harsher conditions, and you get an idea of what ""Skins"" is lacking. ""The Fast Runner"" is a masterpiece film generations will return to. Some have hailed ""Skins"" that way, and it'd be nice if that were true, but the proof isn't on the print.When ""Skins"" does work, it's usually because Graham Greene is onscreen. Greene is Rudy's older brother, Mogie, a relentless-if-remorseful drunk, a failed promise apparently wrecked by a tour in Vietnam. He ambles around the package stores just across the border in Nebraska when he's not working his brother into a frenzy; the fun ends when Rudy torches a liquor store while Mogie's inside trying to left some booze.That happens at the halfway point, and ""Skins"" then shifts into nothingness. The bear trap scene aside, not a lot happens in the movie's final half -- Rudy and Mogie acknowledge the big fire, but never work themselves up over it, while Mogie tries to make peace with his teenage son (Noah Watts). Basically, the last 30 minutes are an elongated ""final days"" sequence for Greene.The final scene is the attention-getter most remember. I admit, it's well-conceived, but the execution of it is amateurish. If you understand editing, you'll wonder why, when the movie's only amazing camera shot is revealed, this shot lasts, at most, two seconds. It aptly sums up ""Skins,"" a movie with a lot to say, and poor visual strategies in which to tell it.",3,A messy movie with a powerfully-packed message,1050537600,"04 17, 2003",2003,3127,"['thoughts', 'are', 'torn', 'Skins', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'chronicle', 'sad', 'wasted', 'lives', 'Native', 'Americans', 'bloody', 'history', 'informed', 'misfortunes', 'nearly', 'entire', 'culture.Directed', 'Chris', 'Eyre', 'movie', 'undeniably', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'not', 'least', 'closing', 'image', 'debasement', 'Mount', 'Rushmore.For', 'lasting', 'image', 'Skins', 'sight', 'local', 'Gary', 'Farmer', 'killed', 'bear', 'trap', 'set', 'neighbors', 'disbelieving', 'reservation', 'cop', 'Eric', 'Schwieg', 'explanation', 'bear', 'trap', 'why', 'nobody', 'answered', 'obvious', 'calls', 'help', 'none', 'Not', 'plausible', 'anyway', 'So', 'many', 'Natives', 'problems', 'have', 'roots', 'something', 'be', 'history', 'abuse', 'lack', 'opportunities', 'do', 'not', 'justify', 'much', 'mindlessness', 'invaded', 'Pine', 'Ridge', 'Reservation', 'South', 'Dakota.Eyre', 'prove', 'point', 'cop', 'Rudy', 'Yellow', 'Lodge', 'vigilante', 'who', 'criminals', 'burns', 'down', 'Nebraska', 'liquor', 'shops', 'off', 'hours', 'efforts', 'essentially', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'fruitless', 'anything', 'else', 'drunks', 'still', 'get', 'drunk', 'reservation', 'mostly', 'hopeless', 'brutal', 'past', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'changed.Which', 'brings', 'other', 'side', 'thoughts', 'Skins', 'powerful', 'poorly', 'made', 'editing', 'documentary-style', 'camerawork', 'acting', 'simply', 'left', 'wanting', 'Given', 'subject', 'matter', 'table', 'absolute', 'dead-in-the-eye', 'importance', 'probably', 'quibbling', 'criticize', 'production', 'values', 'Nevertheless', 'mention', 'way', 'better', 'film', 'look', 'Fast', 'Runner', 'amazing', 'achievement', 'shot', 'similar', 'small', 'budget', 'far', 'harsher', 'conditions', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'Skins', 'lacking', 'Fast', 'Runner', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'generations', 'will', 'return', 'have', 'hailed', 'Skins', 'way', ""'d"", 'be', 'nice', 'were', 'true', 'proof', ""n't"", 'print.When', 'Skins', 'work', 'usually', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'onscreen', 'Greene', 'Rudy', 'older', 'brother', 'Mogie', 'relentless-if-remorseful', 'drunk', 'failed', 'promise', 'apparently', 'wrecked', 'tour', 'Vietnam', 'package', 'stores', 'just', 'border', 'Nebraska', 'when', 'not', 'working', 'brother', 'frenzy', 'fun', 'when', 'Rudy', 'liquor', 'store', 'Mogie', 'inside', 'trying', 'left', 'happens', 'halfway', 'point', 'Skins', 'then', 'nothingness', 'bear', 'trap', 'scene', 'aside', 'not', 'lot', 'movie', 'final', 'half', 'Rudy', 'Mogie', 'acknowledge', 'big', 'fire', 'never', 'work', 'up', 'Mogie', 'make', 'peace', 'teenage', 'son', 'Noah', 'Watts', 'Basically', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'are', 'elongated', 'final', 'days', 'sequence', 'Greene.The', 'final', 'scene', 'attention-getter', 'most', 'remember', 'admit', 'well-conceived', 'execution', 'amateurish', 'understand', 'editing', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'why', 'when', 'movie', 'only', 'amazing', 'camera', 'shot', 'revealed', 'shot', 'most', 'two', 'seconds', 'aptly', 'Skins', 'movie', 'lot', 'say', 'poor', 'visual', 'strategies', 'tell']",Skins VHS
