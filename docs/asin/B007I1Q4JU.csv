Unfortunately, my Dad passed away before I could get this for him on DVD.  All the same, watching this movie brings back memories and I enjoyed it more than I can explain.  I was expecting sub-par quality because I wasn't sure how well this older movie could transfer to DVD.  But, the quality is simply wonderful!  I wasn't able to purchase this in time for my Dad to enjoy, but I do plan on getting another copy for my sister in &#34;tribute&#34; to my Dad, now that I know that this is the real deal.",5,Finally!!,1404259200,"07 2, 2014",2014,591,"['was', 'one', 'Dad', 'favorite', 'movies', 'now', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'VHS', 'Unfortunately', 'Dad', 'passed', 'away', 'could', 'get', 'DVD', 'same', 'watching', 'movie', 'back', 'memories', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'can', 'explain', 'was', 'expecting', 'sub-par', 'quality', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'well', 'older', 'movie', 'could', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'quality', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'purchase', 'time', 'Dad', 'enjoy', 'do', 'plan', 'getting', 'copy', 'sister', '34', 'tribute', '34', 'Dad', 'now', 'know', 'real', 'deal']",Tick...Tick...Tick...

Growing up in the deep south, I could identify with Jim Price character played by Jim Brown. The overall theme throughout the movie was just a guy trying to do his job in a hostile environment with little or no help. The background music was a bit too ""folksy"" for me, but the acting is top-notch by Jim Brown, George Kennedy, and Fredrick March. Listening to March trying to do a southern accent was hilarious. I recorded this movie off my local television station back in the 90's. I was glad to find it was on DVD. The DVD transfer was a good as it could be for a 40+ year old movie. I thought this movie was not as good as ""In The Heat Of The Night"" with Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier, but very well done in any case.",5,Solid entertainment.,1345075200,"08 16, 2012",2012,811,"['remember', 'watching', 'movie', 'theater', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', '70', 'Growing', 'up', 'deep', 'south', 'could', 'identify', 'Jim', 'Price', 'character', 'played', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'overall', 'theme', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'guy', 'trying', 'do', 'job', 'hostile', 'environment', 'little', 'help', 'background', 'music', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'folksy', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'Fredrick', 'March', 'Listening', 'March', 'trying', 'do', 'southern', 'accent', 'was', 'hilarious', 'recorded', 'movie', 'local', 'television', 'station', 'back', '90', 'was', 'glad', 'find', 'was', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'was', 'good', 'could', 'be', '40+', 'year', 'old', 'movie', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Heat', 'Night', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'case']",Tick...Tick...Tick...

This story is one of societal tension in a small Southern town as the changing times of the early 1960's bring about a radical turn of events. The main players are hot headed traditionalist wanting to make trouble against the  cool tempered new leadership in town.  As the plot develops it becomes clear that if people do not come together for the good of the town, things will become very bad for all!
