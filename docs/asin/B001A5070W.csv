The movie addresses hard questions regarding self-image, confidence, and body-issues and how those three things all contribute to one another.

1165171,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B001A5070W,Haunted Flower,"[2, 2]","Disfigured DVD Review1 Disc (2008)""Disfigured"" was written and directed by Glenn Gers and stars Deidra Edwards and Staci Lawrence. Deidra Edwards is Lydia dealing with being fat and Staci Lawrence is Darcy dealing with anorexia and they form an unlikely friendship after Darcy tries to join a Fat Acceptance Group since she believes she is fat. This is a must-see movie for any woman (or man for that matter) who has had any issues with body image.This is a shockingly amazing story coming from a male writer/director. Glenn Gers really captured these women as fully rounded characters in an intimate and real way. He gives equal focus to overweight and underweight people bringing the whole message back to body image and the fact that people need to be comfortable in their own skin before they can change or they will never be happy.The script is very accurate to how women feel about body image and does an excellent job of giving both sides a lot of time and making sure both women get to know the other's problems more closely. Being overweight or underweight both have implications for affecting one's life health-wise, in relationships, at work, and especially how one feels when they are alone. Their friendship and discussions help both of them begin to move toward trying to be healthier people overall without worrying about body image. Anorexia very much is a dark, painful journey that Darcy does a great job explaining emotionally in her face and words, but appears more functional than a real person would be so the viewer has to understand that while she got the emotion dead-on, it really is a lot more painful to watch physically than she could demonstrate without living it. Lydia is actually a healthier person than Darcy though it might not look that way on the outside. She is emotionally stronger and more connected to others and has the capacity to love than Darcy has lost along with all other enthusiasm for life and food.The movie does not leave the viewer with concrete solutions other than women apparently need to get together and talk about body image to learn to accept themselves before they can change themselves (anorexics seeking therapy, fat people committing to better health, etc). The major downfall of the movie is the low budget leading to lots of handheld shaky camera which is occasionally distracting and the lighting sometimes is so bright that it looks like an actress is standing against a white background when they are in a living room with furniture in it. The sound also gets a little hard to hear sometimes.DVD Extras:This DVD is packed full of extras. First off, there is director and cast commentary with Glenn Gers, Deidra Edwards, Staci Lawrence, and Ryan C. Benson which is very informative about background information and facts. There is a Behind-The-Scenes feature showing off Venice Beach starting off with the story of two overweight people wanting to walk and the story developing from that and online message boards drama. It was a challenging film to shoot on the beach with lots of unwanted background noise that had to be weeded out and it was a very hot, humid shoot with lots of ""night"" indoor shots being taken in the daytime with black plastic over windows making it hard on the actors. Unfortunately the interview taken with Staci Lawrence is apparently in a noisy night club or something because it is very difficult to hear her. This entire feature length film was shot in fifteen days!There is a Fat Acceptance and Eating Disorders featurette explaining what actual fat acceptance movements are about and how he took it a bit farther to make an argument. Glenn Gers hosts this portion and recommends a book title ""Rethinking Thin"" as a good source of information and admonishes anyone from thinking anorexia is an attractive idea before jumping to an interview segment between some experts in the field to provide some of the psychology behind the ideas from the film. One group fights for civil rights of fat people and discusses the discrimination in the workplace and elsewhere. They emphasize the movie's message of education and communication for advancement in solving these problems. A ""weight neutral"" perspective is like a foreign language. Exploring anorexia, they brought forth some symptoms that weren't shown in the film that Darcy actually would have been experiencing like coldness, hiding one's body in bulky clothes, and a slowing down of metabolism and energy except during compulsive exercise. Darcy was a very functional anorexic in this movie and her body was shown a lot more for the viewer than actually affected people would have. The experts here vow that it is a disease one can recover from though it is widely believed that isn't the case. It is a very informative and helpful.The outtakes and improvisations are very funny and the deleted scenes were very informative showing more symptoms for Darcy and more of both main characters' childhood history.",5,A huge achievement of nailing the female perspective for women and body image somehow coming from a male writer/director!,1271376000,"04 16, 2010",2010,4958,"['Disfigured',

They succeed to some extent because Darcy does not stop pursuing Lydia. This baffles Lydia at first, but Darcy really needs a friend and the two women eventually realize they have more in common than they would have guessed.I watched this from the point of view of someone who has been borderline anorexic... never enough to get sick, but have definitely had weight issues... currently weigh exactly what I am supposed to (according to those horrible weight charts) and still hate my body. So when I saw this movie on the shelf I had to snatch it up. The film has received some criticism for making Darcy too healthy and they even mention in the special features that if Darcy is appealing to you, you should speak to someone about it. It is true... she is very functional. She has a successful job, is not sick, and is just very thin, not skeletal. Of course, she is ""recovering."" I guess we have to remember that. But there is even a scene where Darcy attends a party, her mom talks her into eating a snack, and Darcy goes to the bathroom and spits it out. I really have to agree that they did NOT make Darcy look sick enough. Or at all. Considering almost everyone else in the cast was overweight, of course if you could choose to look like anyone, you would want to look like Darcy. I think that was a mistake. Lydia is obviously healthier than Darcy. Physically AND mentally. But no one wants to look like her.Despite that, I liked everything about the movie. Although I love special effects, I love when movies are based on acting, plot and real-life situations like this movie. Darcy and Lydia discussed prejudice they have experienced from family and friends and even strangers based solely on how they look and they bonded over that. They tried to help each other learn to eat better. They were not exactly successful. But learning to live a healthy lifestyle can take a lifetime. This was a movie that made you think and I love that.About the sex scene between Lydia and her overweight friend. Yeah, I thought it was gross, but I have also never liked watching sex scenes between skinny people either. They are gross too. It's just a personal preference I guess. It's beyond me why people want to do that in front of a camera. I think movies are better without them. But I do understand that they wanted to make it seem as normal for fat people as for everyone else. It's just too bad they had to.I loved the scene where Darcy and Lydia traded ""concerns"" their families always express for them. Darcy: ""I feel like I'm going to break you!"" Lydia: ""I'm just worried you're going to have a heart attack any day now!"" They had tons of them and they were so funny. Unfortunately, most of this scene ended up in the deleted scenes section, so make sure you don't miss it.",4,Thought provoking.... and sometimes even funny!,1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,2962,"['story', 'Lydia', 'overweight', 'woman', 'Darcy', 'recovering', 'anorexic', 'who', 'meet', 'up', 'chance', 'attempt', 'really', 'hard', 'become', 'friends', 'obvious', 'differences', 'succeed', 'extent', 'Darcy', 'not', 'stop', 'pursuing', 'Lydia', 'Lydia', 'first', 'Darcy', 'really', 'friend', 'two', 'women', 'eventually', 'realize', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'would', 'have', 'guessed.I', 'watched', 'point', 'view', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'borderline', 'anorexic', 'never', 'enough', 'get', 'sick', 'have', 'definitely', 'had', 'weight', 'issues', 'currently', 'weigh', 'exactly', 'what', 'am', 'supposed', 'according', 'horrible', 'weight', 'charts', 'still', 'hate', 'body', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'shelf', 'had', 'snatch', 'up', 'film', 'received', 'criticism', 'making', 'Darcy', 'too', 'healthy', 'even', 'mention', 'special', 'features', 'Darcy', 'appealing', 'should', 'speak', 'someone', 'true', 'very', 'functional', 'successful', 'job', 'not', 'sick', 'just', 'very', 'thin', 'not', 'skeletal', 'course', 'recovering', 'guess', 'have', 'remember', 'even', 'scene', 'where', 'Darcy', 'party', 'mom', 'eating', 'snack', 'Darcy', 'bathroom', 'spits', 'out', 'really', 'have', 'agree', 'did', 'NOT', 'make', 'Darcy', 'look', 'sick', 'enough', 'Considering', 'almost', 'everyone', 'else', 'cast', 'was', 'overweight', 'course', 'could', 'choose', 'look', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'look', 'Darcy', 'think', 'was', 'mistake', 'Lydia', 'obviously', 'healthier', 'Darcy', 'Physically', 'AND', 'mentally', 'one', 'look', 'her.Despite', 'liked', 'everything', 'movie', 'love', 'special', 'effects', 'love', 'when', 'movies', 'are', 'based', 'acting', 'plot', 'real-life', 'situations', 'movie', 'Darcy', 'Lydia', 'discussed', 'prejudice', 'have', 'experienced', 'family', 'friends', 'even', 'strangers', 'based', 'solely', 'how', 'look', 'bonded', 'over', 'tried', 'help', 'other', 'learn', 'eat', 'better', 'were', 'not', 'exactly', 'successful', 'learning', 'live', 'healthy', 'lifestyle', 'can', 'take', 'lifetime', 'was', 'movie', 'made', 'think', 'love', 'sex', 'scene', 'Lydia', 'overweight', 'friend', 'Yeah', 'thought', 'was', 'gross', 'have', 'also', 'never', 'liked', 'watching', 'sex', 'scenes', 'skinny', 'people', 'either', 'are', 'gross', 'too', 'just', 'personal', 'preference', 'guess', 'why', 'people', 'want', 'do', 'front', 'camera', 'think', 'movies', 'are', 'better', 'do', 'understand', 'wanted', 'make', 'seem', 'normal', 'fat', 'people', 'everyone', 'else', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'had', 'to.I', 'loved', 'scene', 'where', 'Darcy', 'Lydia', 'traded', 'concerns', 'families', 'always', 'express', 'Darcy', 'feel', ""'m"", 'going', 'break', 'Lydia', ""'m"", 'just', 'worried', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'heart', 'attack', 'day', 'now', 'had', 'tons', 'were', 'so', 'funny', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'scene', 'ended', 'up', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'section', 'so', 'make', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss']",Disfigured

They are shocked when Darcy, an anorexic-looking woman comes in and asks to join the group because she feels fat, too.  The two lonely women begin a tentative friendship based on their mutual isolation, but their years of rejection may keep them from really being comfortable with each other.The movie starts out looking like a documentary or a reality show, but soon takes a dramatic turn as we get to know spunky, troubled  Lydia and morose Darcy.  Women of all sizes can relate to the pressure to be perfect and the misery of those who compulsively overeat or starve.  The movie does not resolve any issues and there are no magical make-overs,  it just brings an important subject to light and opens it up for discussion.I think the writer/director made the most of his $50K budget, but it still looks like a student film.  The dialogue is sometimes corny and the sound quality is poor as is the photography.  Most of all, the actors, while earnest, were simply not good enough to make me forget I was watching a cheap movie.

There is phenomenal pressure especially on women to stay thin; and of course there are the medical problems that can come with being overweight. In addition, there are medical problems and other issues that are associated with anorexia. Disfigured does a splendid job of showcasing the lives, the everyday struggles, and the emotional roller coaster ride people can go on when they try to come to terms with body image issues, weight, self-esteem, self-acceptance, anger, fear and so much more. The acting is terrific despite the fact that these are not very well known actors; they certainly had me convinced they were real people and not just actors! The plot moves along at a very good pace and I was never once bored. The cinematography is also excellent.When the action starts, we quickly meet the overweight members of a fat acceptance self-help group; they want to change societal attitudes so that there will be less prejudice against overweight people. One afternoon an anorexic woman, Darcy (Staci Lawrence) comes; she truly thinks she is overweight and she wants to join the group. She is quickly voted out except by one member, Lydia (Deidra Edwards) who thinks maybe Darcy should be allowed to join the group.Although she was voted out of the group, Darcy wants to help Lydia advertise her new fat acceptance walking group. Lydia is taken by surprise; she's not sure what to make of Darcy. However, Darcy is very eager to make a friend; and the good natured Lydia makes friends with Darcy. It isn't too long after the walking group starts that Lydia meets Bob (Ryan C. Benson); Lydia and Bob start a ""no strings attached"" affair and it's very interesting to see their relationship develop.Eventually Lydia and Darcy become closer with each woman sincerely trying their best to help the other with weight and body image issues. Darcy stays over at Lydia's place to keep a watchful eye on Lydia so that she won't overeat without being noticed; and Lydia asks Darcy for ""anorexia lessons"" when she becomes involved with Bob. These two women want desperately to help each other confront their deepest psychological fears and demons so that they can get stronger and no longer suffer. All along the way, Lydia and Darcy confront issues including anger, fear and the need to let feelings ""in"" instead of just letting feelings ""out.""Will Lydia and Darcy conquer their demons and gain more control over their weight and body image issues? What about Lydia and Bob--will they stay together or will something eventually cause them to go their separate ways? What about the tension between Darcy and her mother--how will they manage to keep things under control? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!The DVD comes with a plethora of bonus features; and that's terrific. There's an optional running commentary with Staci Lawrence, Deidra Edwards, Ryan C. Benson and director Glenn Gers; three deleted scenes; a ""behind the scenes"" featurette; outtakes and bloopers; a featurette on fat acceptance and eating disorders; the theatrical trailer and more!Disfigured shines as a brilliant film that focuses on incredibly important social and psychological issues regarding body image, weight, self-acceptance, anger and so much more.

There is even a scene where the obese woman announces a fat acceptance walking group to her support group, and she is ridiculed because apparently walking means that you are caving into society's ideals of beauty. I guess being active and eating healthy means you hate yourself, according to those idiots. At times the movie seemed poorly filmed and the dialogue was overdone or overly boring.",2,Didn't like it,1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,625,"['got', 'bored', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'finish', 'ignorance', 'sides', 'fence', 'regards', 'anorexic', 'woman', 'obese', 'woman', 'who', 'understand', 'dont', 'have', 'starve', 'be', 'thin', 'even', 'scene', 'where', 'obese', 'woman', 'fat', 'acceptance', 'walking', 'group', 'support', 'group', 'ridiculed', 'because', 'apparently', 'walking', 'means', 'are', 'caving', 'society', 'ideals', 'beauty', 'guess', 'being', 'active', 'eating', 'healthy', 'means', 'hate', 'according', 'idiots', 'times', 'movie', 'seemed', 'poorly', 'filmed', 'dialogue', 'was', 'overdone', 'overly', 'boring']",Disfigured

The movie uses comedy in a brilliant way to make us laugh and cry at ourselves.  You'll see the ugliness of a society that perpetuates being slim and fit, at any cost, while fearing the so-called curse of being overweight. Overweight people have a right to be angry with society's prejudice toward them.""A survey of persons asked the question of being 100 lbs. overweight for life or losing a hand, which would you choose?; an overwhelming majority chose losing the hand.""As a man watching this movie I was given a lesson in why so many women are so conscious of their weight as well as what makes a woman beautiful at any size. The confidence and realness of the big woman in contrast to the insecurity and emotional detachment from life of the little woman drives the message home perfectly in this movie.This movie forces the viewer to participate in the onscreen dialogue. It makes us aware of our own fears and weaknesses as well as that of our friends and family when it comes to compulsive anything.  More importantly though it shows us how to accept and be happy with our imperfect selves and our imperfect friends.A must see at any weight!",4,Well At Least I'm Not (fill in the blank),1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,1232,"['movie', 'wonderful', 'lesson', 'how', 'hurtful', 'can', 'be', 'ourselves', 'others', 'movie', 'comedy', 'brilliant', 'way', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', ""'ll"", 'see', 'ugliness', 'society', 'being', 'slim', 'fit', 'cost', 'fearing', 'so-called', 'curse', 'being', 'overweight', 'Overweight', 'people', 'have', 'right', 'be', 'angry', 'society', 'prejudice', 'A', 'survey', 'persons', 'asked', 'question', 'being', '100', 'lbs', 'overweight', 'life', 'losing', 'hand', 'would', 'choose', 'overwhelming', 'majority', 'chose', 'losing', 'hand', 'man', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'given', 'lesson', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'women', 'are', 'so', 'conscious', 'weight', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'woman', 'beautiful', 'size', 'confidence', 'realness', 'big', 'woman', 'contrast', 'insecurity', 'emotional', 'detachment', 'life', 'little', 'woman', 'message', 'home', 'perfectly', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'viewer', 'participate', 'onscreen', 'dialogue', 'aware', 'own', 'fears', 'weaknesses', 'as', 'well', 'friends', 'family', 'when', 'compulsive', 'anything', 'More', 'importantly', 'how', 'accept', 'be', 'happy', 'imperfect', 'selves', 'imperfect', 'friends.A', 'must', 'see', 'weight']",Disfigured
