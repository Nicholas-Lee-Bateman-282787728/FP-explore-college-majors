One is hippy, chubby, petite, and tall, so how can the pants fit each girl perfect, who the heck knows? Each of the four girls take turns sharing the good luck pants during summer vacation, each of the girls have different summer plans so the pants will keep them connected somehow. Amber Tamblyn's storyline was the most interesting but the rest of the girl's vacation stories had no depth or personal growth in my opinion.

928288,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B000AM4PEK,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[60, 63]","This is a truly amazing film brought to life by four truly amazing girls-- Alexis Bledel as shy Lena, Amber Tamblyn as rebel Tibby, Blake Lively as fun-loving Bridget, and America Ferrera as writer Carmen. Each girl has a different story to deliver from different parts of the world. Lena's in Greece with her grandparents, Tibby's at home working a dull job at Wallman's, Bridget is at soccer camp in Mexico, and Carmen is visiting her father in South Carolina.Together, they form the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants after discovering that a hot pair of Levi's fits each of their different body types perfectly. They decide that the best thing to do is to share the jeans since they'll be spending the summer apart, wearing them for one week and then mailing them to the next person. Lena gets them first, almost drowning the first day she wears them, only to be rescued by a cute Greek boy, who will no doubt get her out of her shell. Tibby gets them next, who is staying home to work to get money for more camera equipment to make her ""suckumentary."" She meets a vivacious 12 year old named Bailey, a girl who loves life as opposed to Tibby's ""life sucks"" attitude. Carmen then gets the jeans-- she learns that her father (who left her when she was young) is remarrying a woman with two children. She feels like an outcast in a see of blonde Brady Bunchers. Then the jeans head to Bridget. She's still coping with her mother's suicide, and flirts with the off limits soccer coach because it gives her something to do other than be sad.So the jeans travel between each girl throughout the movie, each time getting a new story and opening up new chapters in these girls' lives. This is a wonderful movie. Very well played out and extremely well written, surprisingly so for a film about girl power... it stacks up much better than films like Sleepover or New York Minute, which absolutely stink compared to this rare summer jewel.

But they did it so well that it's unobtrusive.  Also, having four good actresses with distinct personalties helped.My main complaint is the Bridget subplot.

And that is OK with me, I enjoyed the book and I enjoyed the film. To me it felt genuine. We all know that with these movies often times it is the parents who buy the tickets, so the studio feels as though they have to pander to them.  I didn't get that impression with this film. For example, the parents in this film are not slightly flawed goofs who mean the best for their kids. Rather, and more realistically, they are deeply flawed humans who mean the best for themselves. For a good example of a bad movie written by, and for, parents watch ""Sleepover."" I also felt as though the problems they tapped into were real; insufferable step-parents, awful jobs, and loss. As much as we all loved ""Mean Girls"" some of us have bigger problems than fitting in with the Plastics. Of course this film, as with all films has flaws. In this case I would point to a light cheese glaze that coats the entire film. There are way too many tears spilled by the characters and the love interests made me want to gag with their complete lack of chest hair. Also, a certain death bed scene left some of the audience in stitches. Does that mean there is a problem with the film or the audience? I would probably a little bit of much. The character of Lena was damaged by the actress who played her. Not that I have anything against Alexis Bledel, quite the opposite actually. I just felt as though Lena came off as muted. Think about how much better a trip to Greece would have been with Rory Gilmore. So while Bledel might not have had much to do, the rest of the actresses shine. I was especially surprised by the girl who played Bridget. She was the only actress I wasn't familiar with going into this movie and despite looking like a bimbo she shined. I also enjoyed Amber Tamblyn as Tibby. She gave the film some much needed edge. As happy as I was that the red staters lost their Friday night entertainment when ""Joan of Arcadia"" was cancelled, I did feel bad for Tamblyn. I have no doubt though that she will rebound.  And as a final note, my girlfriend LOVED this film, so any guys out there looking to score points I really recommend this film.

It's true, the comparisons between The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants and The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood are unavoidable. Think of the former as a teen version of the latter. Both examine the trials and tribulations of a close-knit group of women who are there for each other through good times and bad (and other cliches). Yes, this movie follows in the proud tradition of Steel Magnolias and Fried Green Tomatoes.It felt like the filmmakers were trying too hard with the Ya-Ya Sisterhood movie, everything felt a little forced but Traveling Pants avoids this by establishing a more natural rhythm right from the get-go and features more engaging and likable characters. Granted, the film follows a fairly predictable arc but does so in an easy-going and enjoyable way. Traveling Pants has a timeless quality with dialogue that is refreshingly free of contemporary slang and refuses to rely heavily on a hip soundtrack that would date it instantly.""Fun on the Set"" features footage of the four leads bonding on the set.

They laugh and talk about what going on during a given scene in this enjoyable extra. It's a shame that they didn't do a complete commentary for the entire movie.""A Conversation with Ann Brashares"" is a nine minute interview with the author of the book that the film is based on.

928298,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000AM4PEK,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 2]","The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is sort of a teen chick flick, but I still wanted to see it.  I have a few sensitive bones in my body, I still feel like a teenager in many ways, I'm a sucker for sentimental notions, and, man oh man, that Alexis Bledel sure is pretty.  And the film has Amber ""Joan of Arcadia"" Tamblyn in it, too.  I certainly wasn't going to let a little thing like testosterone keep me from enjoying this film.This is basically a story about four best friends spending a summer apart and doing a lot of growing up in the process. Oh, it's also about a pair of magical jeans.  Don't get hung up on that, though; if there's one thing this book isn't, it's silly.  It is instead a very rich and meaningful film about each character's maturation and growing understanding of the important things in life.  This is not to say these girls are all ready to put away girlish things; the summer changes each of them, but they're still normal, healthy young people with their whole lives ahead of them - but they will be better able to appreciate the ups and downs their futures surely hold.The girls themselves, lifelong friends, are very different.  Lena (Alexis Bledel) is shy and reserved, Carmen (America Ferrera) is down-to-earth but a little bit of an outsider, Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) is rather negative and rebellious, and Bridget (Blake Lively) is a boy-crazy blonde who looks and acts 25.  On their last day together before parting ways for the summer, the girls discover an amazing pair of jeans that impossibly fits each of their very different bodies perfectly.  The only logical explanation is a magical one, so the girls vow to share the jeans over the summer and report back on the great strokes of luck the jeans will surely bring them.  Lena gets them first because she is on her way across the world to Greece to stay with her grandparents.  From there they go back to Tibby, who is stuck at home working on a documentary in betweens shifts at a retail store.  Then they're off to Carmen in South Carolina, whose visit with her dad turns in to quite an ordeal.  Last up is Bridget, who is attending a soccer camp south of the border.  Each girl expects something wonderful to happen once she slips on the special jeans.  Instead, the jeans seem to do more harm than good.Lena meets a young man who expands her horizons and begins to free of her inhibitions, only to be told to stay away from him.  Tibby finds herself saddled with a younger girl named Bailey (Jenna Boyd) who insinuates herself right into her whole documentary project.  Carmen feels like a total outsider around her dad and the new family he is about to marry into, and Bridget's shameless pursuit of an older boy ends up opening deep hurts she has tried to pretend don't exist.  So much for the magic jeans - but let's not be so hasty.  Seeds have been sown, and each girl eventually does experience a bit of magic that transforms them and, in the end, brings them closer together.This is a story of laughter, tears, and emotional growth.  The film offers up many poignant moments, especially in terms of Tibby's summer experience, and it does a marvelous job of transitioning from one story to the next.  The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is just a real winner, a marvelously impressive film that speaks not only to teenaged girls but to all of us who allow the movie into our hearts and minds.  It deals with some pretty major themes in both straightforward and effectively subtle ways, and all of the girls turn in wonderful performances.  Forget about the magical jeans (they're just a metaphor, you know); this movie is all about real life, friendship, and growing up.  Anyone with a heart should be touched in some way by this film.

(Their moms were all in Lamaze class together.)They have shared hopes, dreams, and now will spend the summer sharing pants. They found a perfect pair of pants that fit both thin and curvy girls somehow. They feel that there is ""magic"" in those pants and good things will happen to those who wear them. They promise to send them to each location (they will go their separate ways for the summer) every few weeks. They even come up with rules about wearing the pants, ""You can't ever say you are fat while wearing the pants. Only the wearer of the pants can take them off."" and so on.Lena goes to Greece to visit family, Bridget goes to soccer camp in Mexico, Carmen goes to South Carolina to visit her father that she hardly ever sees, and Tibby has to stay home and work at Wallmans while making her ""suckumentary.""As they start to wear the pants, things are going wrong: Lena meets the perfect boy, but their grandparents have a feud and she is told not to see him. Bridget meets a boy as well, but he is also her coach and they are not allowed to get involved. Carmen finds that her father is going to be remarried and now he is going to have two stepchildren. They all live together in the suburbs and seem to have the perfect life. Tibby meets a 12 year old who fainted in her store and this girl follows her around while she gives interviews and wants to work for her.Do the pants really have magic in them, or are they just imagining that great things will happen to them while wearing these jeans? One thing stays true: the four friends are there for each other throughout and support one another if things don't go the way they hoped.Of course there are a few sappy parts, some unrealistic, but I did cry genuine tears.

But the title should NOT prevent the general audience from experiencing a truly tender, warm, balanced film about four teenage girlfriends bonded by a magical pair of jeans.There are four stories here, each centered on the summer experiences of the four girls who go off in different directions and discover a lot about themselves and life: Lena (Alexis Bledel) follows family ties to Greece, encountering 'tradition vs love' with Kostas (Michael Rady, a newcomer whose looks and screen presence bode well for a fine career!); Bridget (Blake Lively) finds a balance of love and soccer in Mexico; Carmen (America Ferrera) explores family ties and body image in a new stepmother; Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) works the summer in 'Wallmans' and pursues her passion for documentary filmmaking which just happens to include a real life drama.  So why do these simple tales make a movie?  Each of the girls represents the delicate issues that teenagers encounter as they move into adulthood, and the manner in which director Ken Kwapis intertwines these stories through the common bond of the four girls' friendship works on every level.There is a sense of fresh talent, fresh writing, fresh direction, and sensitive acting that make this movie one to be recommended to a large audience.

While that may work for Renee Zellweger's Bridget Jones character, there is a new way of recording one's daily interactions, and they are as revolutionary, and of such a classic simple design, 'Jurassic Park' DNA experts could never have seen this future event coming. There might come a time when woman will inherit the earth, but until that time the answers we seek to every day questions will not lie in a 'Jumunji' board game...or even in Aladdin's lamp, or an endless supply of Tim Tam's that will never run out.Had it not been for Eve, who ate an apple from The Tree of Knowledge, and God's original plan for all of human kind to venture forth naked and oblivious into the world, we might still not know. Only now has the real truth been uncovered, for the answers can be found in a pair of jeans and so a new era of understand between man and woman must come into play if we are to understand the inner most secrets of the human female mind, and patch up the gapping black holes that allude us in space and distance us from our loved ones. At long last The Gap between man and woman shall be filled.The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants' might be the butt of everyone's jokes, but there is no denying the allure a pair of pants hold for anyone not in on their universal attraction.With genuine admiration for everything the denim jean has to offer the human world, I find it as no surprise one special pair of pants found it not only into stores, but into three books and a feature film with the promise of more in store.In a ever increasing world where the exploits of human teenagers can be found in three servings of pie, and frolicing without pants for most of the duration of the films is quite incredible and all the rage, you'll be sadly mistaken if girls will do the same with such reckless disregard for moral dignity.'The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants' succeeds in cleaning up and removing the sticky residue left by teenage boys in their beds or car seats from numerous past films, and gives boys something else to dream about that wont leave them wet and cold. Yet still willingly at a woman's mercy when having to endure this film to discover the secrets all woman hold within.Apart from an essential changing room scene don't expect any more scantally clad teenagers to occupy the screen. Instead you'll see young woman who revel in the fact that jeans hold a world of possibility and wonder for any boy wanting to get between the girl and her zip. You'd also be even more hard pressed if you came across buttons. This is not just another group of girls you can have your wicked way with, and in so doing previous times before, add another notch to your belt. These girls have feelings so often overlooked by some, who'd sooner whack you with the belt rather then willingly undo it. The ability to say no and be in control of your destiny, is something everyone should grab hold of. It isn't always easy but for those who do, the rewards are worth their weight, and wait, in gold. A very precious carmodity to be valued like one's innocence, and the fact that one day they will find the answer to their questions. Their own personal wants and desires will be fulfilled.A unique blend of the finest young people the film world has to offer as well as some new fresh faces are all racked up and sewn delicatly together into the tough denim of this smart, ultra hip new take on modern teenage life, from a totally new unexpected perspective.Jean pockets can hold any number of essential items, and it is this idea I insist you reach for, like a wallet holding oodles of cash that could take any number of jeans out of the store and into your homes. Not since Mandy Moore's song 'In My Pocket' has a film held so much promise.If I needed to compare 'The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants' to another remarkable book series with one subsequent film, I'd call Ann M. Martin, responsible for 'The Baby-Sitters Club' books into action.This film deserves examination, like a mirror that will reflect upon you, and impress your friends. We all might not want to pose for a camera, and be noticed but no matter what experiences we treasure we all should have a desire to leave an imprint on someone or something.Rip this film's origin to shreds and you'll still have a film of substance, respectable enough to wear out and a DVD that will never go out of fashion.",5,These jeans will never leave your behind!

Blake Lively stars as Bridget, fun-loving, sporty, and boycrazy, while America Ferrera is Carmen, the Puerto Rican writer.This movie is about a group of friends all seperated over the summer and how they grow and learn from their adventures. Lena travels to Greece to visit her grandparents, Carmen visits her father in South Carolina, Bridget runs off to a soccer camp in Mexico, leaving Tibby at home working at Wallman's. But before the girls separate, they find an amazing pair of jeans that miraculously fit each of their bodies. They form a sisterhood and promise to send the jeans to one another over the summer. While Lena finds her first love in magical Greece, Bridget crushes on a camp counselor. Carmen deals with her father's surprise engagement and Tibby makes friends with a young girl named Bailey.This is a story filled with life lessons from death to first love to acceptance with yourself. The girls learn from their mistakes and become more comfortable with themselves. With an amazing cast and a great story line, this film is an unforgettable one.

The Sisterhood of Traveling Pants is one of these cases. Based on the novel by Ann Brashares, the story takes a four tightly-knit 17-year-olds and focuses into the lives of each, presenting, perhaps, the best coming-of-age film of 2005. The concept of a ""pair of pants that binds"" may sound silly, but this playful element juxtaposes the dramas presented throughout the story.For a summer, the foursome is separated, each encountering situations that cause them to mature and change. Although the issues they deal with are a bit clich&eacute;d (family acceptance, terminal illness, losing virginity) the stories are real well-developed and feel genuine. At times, the ""philosophical"" moments of the film come in corny generalizations (""the stars are larger than life"" or ""that old building is so artfully perfect""), but I guess they make sense coming from the mouths of teens. There are beautiful shots in the film, as location plays a huge role in each story--the scenes in Greece are my favorite.The Sisterhood will mostly appeal to gals between the ages of 16 and 20, but older women (and maybe men) will also appreciate it, as it will make them reminisce about their youth.",4,A Memorable Coming-of-Age Film,1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,1275,"['something', 'so', 'catchy', 'irresistible', 'dripping', 'sentimentality', 'when', 'done', 'right', 'Sisterhood', 'Traveling', 'Pants', 'one', 'cases', 'Based', 'novel', 'Ann', 'Brashares', 'story', 'four', 'tightly-knit', '17-year-olds', 'lives', 'presenting', 'perhaps', 'best', 'coming-of-age', 'film', '2005', 'concept', 'pair', 'pants', 'binds', 'may', 'sound', 'silly', 'playful', 'element', 'dramas', 'presented', 'story.For', 'summer', 'foursome', 'separated', 'encountering', 'situations', 'cause', 'mature', 'change', 'issues', 'deal', 'are', 'bit', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'family', 'acceptance', 'terminal', 'illness', 'losing', 'virginity', 'stories', 'are', 'real', 'well-developed', 'feel', 'genuine', 'times', 'philosophical', 'moments', 'film', 'come', 'corny', 'generalizations', 'stars', 'are', 'larger', 'life', 'old', 'building', 'so', 'artfully', 'perfect', 'guess', 'make', 'sense', 'coming', 'mouths', 'teens', 'are', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'film', 'location', 'huge', 'role', 'story', 'scenes', 'Greece', 'are', 'favorite.The', 'Sisterhood', 'will', 'mostly', 'appeal', 'gals', 'ages', '16', '20', 'older', 'women', 'maybe', 'men', 'will', 'also', 'appreciate', 'will', 'make', 'reminisce', 'youth']",N/A
928324,A3LQ06WS0PMWSQ,B000AM4PEK,"Khyraen ""Superintendent, Barlow Christian Aca...","[4, 4]","Oh no!  Why did I ever rent this chick flick?  I mean, it was a pretty good movie over all, but now I remember WHY I don't like chick movies (books, etc.).  These types of media are designed to be sappy in a way that hopefully makes you cry and laugh (or at least smile) and want to hug your best friend.  And, yes, this movie was a success.The Sisterhood starts with a pretty original idea; an idea that one could totally believe teenagers might think of (if one can get past the crazy notion that somehow those pants actually fit all four girls.)  Teen girls and clothes are like peanut butter and jelly, after all.But, the originality slacks off to 50% after that.What isn't original:...the dying little kid story (sorry, this is just done way too often)...the fact that the shy girl finds romance and her voice over the summer...the fact that the beautiful blonde is the overbearing, successful, leader type that always gets what she wants.What is original:...not all the girls have happy endings...the movie attempts to show that teenagers sometimes don't understand what they are feeling or know what they are doing and why (especially when it comes to two subjects, parents and sex) and that...they are prone to act rashly and in ways that may come back to hurt them.I think the Greek rivalry in Lena's family deserved more story time and therefore was abrupt in its resolution.  I found Carmen's story very touching and real and I cried quite a bit with her as she tried to acknowledge and deal with her hurt and anger.All the characters were very different from each other (maybe a bit too different) and they were flawed (which made them more believable.)  However, they were definitely stereo-type characters (the outgoing, sexy, arrogant blonde; the shy, quiet, modest brunette; the rebel with wild hair and piercing who really isn't as `harsh' as you think she is; and the slightly overweight girl who is ""put upon"" by others and has to learn to stand up for herself.)The dialog was aimed more at preteens and teenagers than grown women and I really can't see a man enjoying this film.The shots in Greece were beautiful and almost worth watching the movie just to see.  The beaches are beautiful, the water is inviting, and the contrast of the white, sharp-angled Greek buildings to the surrounding land and sea is awe-inspiring no matter how many times you see it.The Sisterhood showed that teens are better off developing good relationships and open communication with friends AND with their parents.  This, and the fact that the one ""sexual encounter"" was handled in a way to show that teen sex is more complicated than most teen movies would have us to believe (although the resolution to that fell completely flat and unbelievable in this house), give this movie a depth and realism that is much more than one usually finds in anything ""chick"" or ""teen.""  For that reason, it is a good movie to watch with your teen daughter and then talk about.For the fact that this film shows romance as an essential (or normal or expected) element of teen life and that a physical expression of s*xual desires while still in high school is normal and acceptable, and that in the end, the one-night-stand that cost Bridget her v*rginity only caused a couple of days of a sadness, this movie is not recommended for young teens who have not made a personal commitment to purity.All that being said, some of the questions this movie asks are important questions and good discussion starters.  This movie could be a good conversation starter if you watch it with your daughter and then spend some time together afterwards, perhaps over some pie or ice cream, and talk.",4,"A ""Chick Flick"" that Asks Some Important Questions - Not for Everyone",1131408000,"11 8, 2005",2005,3668,"['Oh', 'Why', 'did', 'ever', 'rent', 'chick', 'flick', 'mean', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'now', 'remember', 'WHY', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'chick', 'movies', 'books', 'etc.', 'types', 'media', 'are', 'designed', 'be', 'sappy', 'way', 'hopefully', 'cry', 'laugh', 'least', 'smile', 'want', 'hug', 'best', 'friend', 'yes', 'movie', 'was', 'success.The', 'Sisterhood', 'pretty', 'original', 'idea', 'idea', 'one', 'could', 'totally', 'believe', 'teenagers', 'might', 'think', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'crazy', 'notion', 'somehow', 'pants', 'actually', 'fit', 'four', 'girls', 'Teen', 'girls', 'clothes', 'are', 'peanut', 'butter', 'jelly', 'all.But', 'originality', '50', '%', 'that.What', ""n't"", 'original', 'dying', 'little', 'kid', 'story', 'sorry', 'just', 'done', 'way', 'too', 'often', 'fact', 'shy', 'girl', 'romance', 'voice', 'summer', 'fact', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'overbearing', 'successful', 'leader', 'type', 'always', 'what', 'wants.What', 'original', 'not', 'girls', 'have', 'happy', 'endings', 'movie', 'show', 'teenagers', 'sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'are', 'feeling', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'why', 'especially', 'when', 'two', 'subjects', 'parents', 'sex', 'are', 'prone', 'act', 'rashly', 'ways', 'may', 'come', 'back', 'hurt', 'them.I', 'think', 'Greek', 'rivalry', 'Lena', 'family', 'deserved', 'more', 'story', 'time', 'therefore', 'was', 'abrupt', 'resolution', 'found', 'Carmen', 'story', 'very', 'touching', 'real', 'cried', 'quite', 'bit', 'tried', 'acknowledge', 'deal', 'hurt', 'anger.All', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'maybe', 'bit', 'too', 'different', 'were', 'flawed', 'made', 'more', 'believable', 'However', 'were', 'definitely', 'stereo-type', 'characters', 'outgoing', 'sexy', 'arrogant', 'blonde', 'shy', 'quiet', 'modest', 'brunette', 'rebel', 'wild', 'hair', 'piercing', 'who', 'really', ""n't"", 'harsh', 'think', 'slightly', 'overweight', 'girl', 'who', 'put', 'others', 'learn', 'stand', 'up', 'dialog', 'was', 'aimed', 'more', 'preteens', 'teenagers', 'grown', 'women', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'man', 'enjoying', 'film.The', 'shots', 'Greece', 'were', 'beautiful', 'almost', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'just', 'see', 'beaches', 'are', 'beautiful', 'water', 'inviting', 'contrast', 'white', 'sharp-angled', 'Greek', 'buildings', 'surrounding', 'land', 'sea', 'awe-inspiring', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'see', 'it.The', 'Sisterhood', 'showed', 'teens', 'are', 'better', 'developing', 'good', 'relationships', 'open', 'communication', 'friends', 'parents', 'fact', 'one', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'was', 'handled', 'way', 'show', 'teen', 'sex', 'more', 'complicated', 'most', 'teen', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'resolution', 'fell', 'completely', 'flat', 'unbelievable', 'house', 'give', 'movie', 'depth', 'realism', 'much', 'more', 'one', 'usually', 'anything', 'chick', 'teen', 'reason', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'teen', 'daughter', 'then', 'talk', 'fact', 'film', 'romance', 'essential', 'normal', 'expected', 'element', 'teen', 'life', 'physical', 'expression', 's*xual', 'desires', 'still', 'high', 'school', 'normal', 'acceptable', 'end', 'one-night-stand', 'cost', 'Bridget', 'v*rginity', 'only', 'caused', 'couple', 'days', 'sadness', 'movie', 'not', 'recommended', 'young', 'teens', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'made', 'personal', 'commitment', 'purity.All', 'being', 'said', 'questions', 'movie', 'are', 'important', 'questions', 'good', 'discussion', 'starters', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'conversation', 'starter', 'watch', 'daughter', 'then', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'afterwards', 'perhaps', 'pie', 'ice', 'cream', 'talk']",N/A
928325,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000AM4PEK,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[2, 2]","In past centuries, long before radio, television, and schools were common, oral traditions passed on moral messages and lessons to children through fairy tales.  The fairy tales often ended happily after the protagonist endured a difficult ordeal of some sort, which intended to teach values such as perseverance and compassion among many other characteristics.  These tales brought the listeners stories filled with magic and strange creatures often influenced by the culture from where the story originated.  Director Ken Kawpis, whose name we recognize from shows such as Malcolm in the Middle, The Bernie Mac Show, and The Office, delivers a contemporary adolescent fairy tale, which superficially does not expose any visible magic.  Instead, it is apparent that something mysterious is in the works, as a pair of jeans, profoundly changes the lives of four teenage girls.Mysterious circumstances enter The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants immediately through the four girls' mothers prenatal exercise classes and they all were born within a week.  It is an intriguing opening, as it touches on themes loaded with mythical elements such as birth, friendship between diverse characters, and how they draw upon each other's friendship to find strength.  Their friendship enhances the fairy tale theme, as the number four leaves traces of magical conditions that resemble the notion of four witches, four corners, and four towers of a fortress - a powerful union between the girls.  Maybe, it all is circumstantial, but everything in the story presents itself in a seemingly preplanned manner, which also suggests the workings of a higher power, magic perhaps.A pair of jeans enters their lives, which somehow strengthens their bond, as some mystical force within the pants pulls them together in a time when body image and eating disorders haunt countless numbers of teens around the world.  The jeans magically fit all of the girls even though they have widely (no pun intended) different body types and sizes.  The jeans become the glue that will help these four girls stay in contact over the summer, as they form a sisterhood (much like witches have done according to the legends.)  Through the sisterhood they form a number of rules, which they have to follow including that they are not allowed to wash them, as this would rinse the magic away.Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) is the only girl who remains in their hometown, as she has planned to finish a film that she is filming.  The other three will travel to places far away where they are suppose to meet their extended family, father, and a soccer camp.  The furthest destination away is Santorini, one of the islands in the Greek Archipelago, where Lena (Alexis Bledel) intends to meet her extended family.  The soccer camp is located across the border south of United States where Bridget (Blake Lively) plans on sharpening her athletic skills.  A couple of states removed from home Carmen (America Ferrara) prepares to spend a lengthy summer with her father who she never has spent more than three consecutive days with.  All of these arrangements sound exiting, however, as they all wear the pants for the first week, bad things happen.Even though it sounds like something bad will happen the feeling of Hollywood does not ever exit the story, as the audience will feel the anticipation of a happy ending.  In a sense, the fairy tale theme is a little too heavy, and does never make the story feel too difficult.  Some of this might have to do with the idea that the film never makes any of the situations appear dreadful more than hinting that something bad is about to happen.  Nonetheless, Tibby seems to be the only one that encounters something that feels truly painful, even after the blissful conclusion.The four stories within the film might be adequate for a younger audience, and maybe feel a little too timid for an adult viewer.  However, it is within the idea of a fairy tale where the notion arises that this is a warm and touching tale that is aimed at a younger audience.  The film uses themes such as Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet while also incorporating topics that affect many teens in our Western Society concerning dating, love, and death which helps many adolescents to find some guidance in regards to issues they might be afraid of approaching themselves.  Thus, Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants helps provide a cinematic experience that many youthful viewers will appreciate while also adult viewers can find a way to help themselves understand today's teens.The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants presents an adolescent contemporary fairy tale that depicts a Western perspective of the teen society that often is illustrated on MTV.  Even though it brings forth much of the traditional Hollywood mood, it actually offers some good lessons for a young audience.  However, the film might be a little less appreciated by a more mature audience, as the story feel much too straightforward and two-dimensional.",4,An Adolescent Contemporary Fairy Tale of Good

928329,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000AM4PEK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 1]","I am not now nor have I ever been a teenager girl, so I am necessarily distanced by age and gender from ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.""  The book by Ann Brashares and the two sequels written to date are much beloved by teenage girls and despite the major and minor changes from the original novel (many of which were pointed out to me by my wife, who has read the book and took full advantage of a rare opportunity to inform me about the differences), it seems clear to me the movie has been embraced by them as well.  Consequently, I have decided to take a different tact and consider this 2005 film adaptation by Delia Ephron and Elizabeth Chandler from the parental perspective.  Young girls can tell us how the movie speaks to them, but how does ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" speak to adults?The conceit of the story is that four teenage girls discover a pair of blue jeans that fits each of them perfectly, despite four totally different body types.  Sensing magic at work and facing their first summer apart, the quartet draw up their sisterhood and its list of rules.  The most important is that each girl gets to wear the pants for a week, and then they must send it on to the next girl on the list, including a letter detailing the most important thing that happened while wearing the pants.  Then the girls are scattered to the four winds for their different experiences with the traveling pants, only two of which involve romantic entanglements.Lena (Alexis Bledel) goes to the island of Santorini to visit her Greek grandparents.  While wearing the pants she falls into the Aegean and is rescued by Kostos (Michael Rady).  A shy, sensitive artist who is embarrassed by public displays of affection, Lena is smitten by Kostos, only to discover that their grandparents have a long-standing feud.  Forbidden by her Yai Yai (Maria Konstandarou) to even look at the boy, Lena disobeys and has to appeal to her Papou (George Touliatos) to allow her to experience life.  Being forbidden to love the one you love is a commonplace in teenager drama, going back well beyond ""Romeo & Juliet,"" and it seems the idea that the prohibitions come from non-Americans (whether Europeans as in this case or immigrants as in others, to wit, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"") is becoming standard as well.  This one is done pretty much by the numbers with the beautiful scenery seeking to cover up the fact this one is nothing new and most parents should recognize the idea that telling a young girl ""no"" is not that different from telling her ""yes.""Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) is stuck at home and is spending her summer making a documentary on losers when she is not working put price stickers on items at Wallman's (gee, why does that sound familiar).  Again her wishes she ends up with a 12-year-old assistant, Bailey (Jenna Boyd), and Tibby is the only one who does not see her introduction to Bailey as portending a sad ending.  What I liked here is that they set up Bailey's secretive taping session as being the payoff for this relationship but it proves to be something else and the best evidence in the film of the magic power of the traveling pants.  At the heart of this one of the biggest of life lessons, which is that you have to put your life in perspective and realize there are worst fates than your own.Bridget (Blake Lively) goes off to a soccer camp in Baja and from the facts that she runs away from her mother's funeral and her disappointment that the camp is only for girls we are to deduce that Bridget is, to put it delicately, looking for trouble.  She settles on one of the young coaches, Eric (Mike Vogel) and goes after him with the single-minded sense of determination and intensity that she displays on the soccer field.  Bridget's motivation is really unclear (to those of us who did not read the book at least) and most parents will be somewhat horrified that things are able to go as far as they do here.  The idea here is that the traveling pants help Bridget achieve her goal, although it is being unscathed in the aftermath that I find to be the greater blessing.Carmen (America Ferrera in a strong followup to ""Real Women Have Curves"") travels to Charleston to spend the summer for some quality alone time with her dad, Al (Bradley Whitford), only to get totally blindsided.  I pity the parent who does not look at Al without being horrified by what he is doing to his daughter, especially given his ability to make things worse.  All of the sympathies here are with Carmen as insult is added to injury, and I liked the fact that she goes through a series of minor explosions that build to the big one.  Pretending that your kids are not hurt and angry only makes them more of both, and the requisite happy ending here is small solace to my way of thinking, but I suppose it constitutes a start and I should be able to give a parent the benefit of the doubt.The extras include the usual deleted scenes, a half-baked version of Tibby's documentary, an interview with Brashares, and a ""video commentary"" that has Bledel, Ferrera and Tamblyn sitting down in from of a VCR and a sea of munchies to comment on the film.  Unfortunately they cover only a few key scenes in the film, but we do learn that Bledel did not subject her fair and freckled skin to the sun in Greece and that Tamblyn's dad must have made her watch ""West Side Story"" a whole bunch of times because she observes that the actor playing Kostos reminds her of a young George Chakiris.",4,The sisterhood spends its first summer with the traveling

They were about to split up for the summer and believed that this magical blue jeans will mean some magical moments for them. So they decided to passed it on to each other in hopes that these magical moments will come to all of them. Pretty surreal plot and these magical moments do come, all rather indirectly and initiately totally unawared by those who wore the pants. Its a movie about rites of passage, where these four girls slowly developed into young adults during that summer. It deals with real situations, without any easy solutions that you find in so many popcorn flicks.The movie proves to be well directed, well acted and well scripted. It does have some weaknesses like couple of them college boys trying to linked up with girls who just turned 17 years old. In some parts of our nation, that would result in a SAM charge.

I know I can review this film with a stream of cliche's: A movie about friendship--a coming of age film--a fairytale where everything does not end happily ever after.But this film is so much more. The friendship of these four seventeen-year-old girls began before they were born; their mothers met during an exercise class for pregnant women. Their friendship is deep and supportive; the girls are extremely close and love each other with all their hearts. And these young ladies all do grow up during the summer before their senior year. One finds love and learns to stand up for herself, another is able to mourn for her mother, another is able to tell her parent what is on her mind after keeping everything bottled up while the fourth gal is finally able to open up her heart.  There are catalysts, many of them traumatic, but they all do find their way. And the girls find they can withstand anything if they have each other.Finding a pair of pants that fit all four of these young women--one chubby, one tall and slender, one petite and one average, the girls vow to share these jeans. So, for the summer the jeans travel to Greece, Mexico and points in America all the while, affecting their lives.I loved this little movie. The girls starring in THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS were very convincing. I believed they loved each other. The story was so sweet and is a wonderful movie for all ages.  Oh, and in my first paragraph I stated that this movie did not have the fairytale ending.

I'm not sure actually - I'd never previously heard of the books, or knew anything about the film. I liked the cover of the DVD if you want me to be honest! Hehe.I'm so glad I got the DVD now, as it's a really, really good, although girls, don't expect to watch it with your boyfriends, it's not their kinda film. Bit too soppy, but he'll probs have his eyes on the actresses right the way through!But how good were the actresses? They were amazing! I'd previously only seen America Ferrera (Carmen) in Real Women Have Curves, and I'm so pleased to see that she still has her curves & her booty, and hasn't succumbed to the image that everyone in Hollywood needs to be anorexic. The other actresses were either first timers, or hadn't appeared in anything significant: Amber Tamblyn (Tibby), Alexis Bledel (Lena), and Blake Lively (Bridget). All actresses were simply amazing, and they had brilliant on screen chemistry, you'd quite believe they'd been friends forever.The storyline is simply this: four childhood friends are separated for a whole summer, their first time apart. Now everyone knows what that's like, been there, done that, cried over it etc. They all experience different things - and a lot of firsts are experienced. First loves, first kiss, losing virginity, death, having to deal with parents, and hinting at a possible pregnancy. Some of it really hit home with me (I'm getting old now though), and I could identify with each girls issues in the film. I'm not sure a lot of younger kids would get most of it, you really need to have experienced this stuff, in order to understand the film. Carmen has a lot to deal with, she has an absentee father, who suddenly brings up the subject of a new wife and family, and being a curvier girl than the rest of her friends leads to some outbursts. Lena has to deal with being in a totally different country to her friends, not understanding the language, and having to find out the first guy she claps eyes on, her grandparents hate and forbid her to see. She really comes out, and starts to grow into her body, and dress how she wants to dress. Bridget, the tall blonde, is a very good footballer, and decides to make it her mission on a training session to seduce her coach - which of course is against the rules. She succeeds in getting what she wants, but afterwards, is left feeling empty and dare I say it, used, and there's hints towards a pregnancy. But it doesn't happen. Why did she go all out to seduce him? To cover up the pain of her mother's death. Tibby is stuck at home, while her friends are off exploring, and her story is the most moving. She's stuck doing rubbish work in a store, while trying to earn enough to carry on filming her documentary/suckumentary.

928338,A1C2P5HX5RLPAX,B000AM4PEK,"M. E. Wood ""Content Writer and Reviewer""","[5, 5]","Carmen and her three friends have known and loved one another for as long as they can remember. Their mothers met in prenatal class. There's Bridget a blonde take charge kind of girl. Lena the shy Greek artist. Tibby the rebel-with-a-cause film documentarian. And Carmen, the writer. Carmen is also the narrator of this story that works on the themes of fate, friends, family and self respect.The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants is based on the novel of the same title by Ann Brashares Ann has a whole series dedicated to the friends and the pants. The girls are all 16 and have never been apart. But this year they are all going off in their own directions for the summer. Before they depart they go on one last shopping trip together. For a joke they try on the same pair of jeans Carmen casually pulls from a bin of disorganized clothing. The girls all different shapes and sizes all magically fit into the same pair of jeans.They decide to buy the jeans and share them over the summer as a way of keeping in touch. In a candle celebration where their mothers met they reside over flame, paper and ink and develop the ""Sisterhood Manifesto"" containing rules they all must abide while wearing the pants; like, each girl gets the pants for a week, no picking your nose while wearing the pants, writing a letter about something exciting that happened while wearing the pants and sending it along with the pants to the next girl. They hold hands and chant ""The pants - the sisterhood - the summer. The rest of our lives Together and apart."" then blow out the candles.LENA is played by Alexis Bledel from Gilmore Girls. She travels to Greece with pants in tow to visit her grandparents. Her first time wearing the pants she falls off the dock, the pant leg catches on a piece of metal and she almost drowns. She is saved by gorgeous Greek student Kostas Dounas (Michael Rady) who, she is told by her grandmother, is ruthless and untrustworthy. Lena quickly sends pants off to Tibby with a letter telling her the pants almost killed her. Greece is breathtaking.TIBBY is played by Amber Tamblyn from Joan of Arcadia. Poor Tibby is stuck at home working in Wallman's department store. While on the job a girl collapses and Tibby calls the ambulance. The girl, played by Jenna Boyd, shows up on Tibby's doorstep a few days later because a parcel (containing the pants) was delivered to her door by accident (or was it).CARMENcita is played by America Ferrera from Real Women Have Curves. Carmen visits her dad, played by Bradley Whitford (West Wing), in South Carolina. He hasn't spent more than four days with her since she was ten. She is very excited about having him all to her self for the summer. Instead he surprises her by bringing her to his new home in the suburbs with his blonde beautiful fianc&eacute;e (Nancy Travis) and her two blonde perfect kids.Carmen is the next to get the pants after getting lost in the mail system for a bit. When they arrive she is thrilled. She wears them when she goes for the bridal fitting which is a disaster. The staff and future step mom treat her as if she isn't there or doesn't have ears while they pulls and pinch at the pink satin number that doesn't fit Carmen's luscious Spanish curves. She quickly changes back into the pants and tells them off.BRIDGET is played by newcomer Blake Lively. She travels to Les Campeonas, a sport soccer camp for girls in Baha. Bridget is a showboat, not a team player. She sets her sights on one of the coaches. He's blonde, she's blonde. He's competitive, she's competitive. A perfect match except he's a coach and she's a student and it just isn't allowed. Now if only the pants would arrive so she can get her man.None of the girls think anything other than bad things happened when they wore the pants but the viewer sees otherwise; the pants gave them a voice. Ken Kwapis did an excellent job of directing these young women and their separate stories. It reminded me a lot of If These Walls Could Talk where the women from different eras were connected by the same house.All the girls played their parts excellently but America Ferrera seemed to pave the way with the narrating and her dominate role. She faces similar conflicts in this role as she did in Real Women Have Curves but it isn't the focus of her story line. If you're a fan of any of these women it's well worth seeing.The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants is about being open to new relationships while maintaining ties with the old. It's also about spreading your wings, making your own decisions and standing up for yourself. Basically, it's about becoming an adult except more entertaining. Overall, it has a good message for women no matter what their age. Have your Kleenex handy. Review written by M. E. WoodFeatures:1.

928339,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000AM4PEK,Michael Butts,"[1, 1]","This is the ultimate ""chick"" flick, but that doesn't mean that we redblooded American males can't be entertained by its excellence.  With an intelligent script, tasteful direction and a marvelous cast, SISTERHOOD transcends the usual teen flick and emerges as a smart, witty, poignant and elegant film about the power of friendship and of course those magic denims.  What makes this delightful film so good is its focus on the girls and their friends and families.  Each girl's personality is given time to develop and we feel like we really get to know them.  Amber Tamblyn and Jenna Boyd are superb as the video-hopeful and her young friend, who is dying from leukemia--but no schmaltz or fake tears here--a genuine regard for life is depicted; America Carrera is the overweight girl who goes to spend the summer with her estranged father and finds out he's got a whole new life planned with girlfriend Nancy Travis and her children.  Bradley Whitford is good as the conflicted father.  Blake Lively is the seemingly with it blonde who goes after Mike Vogel, her coach at a summer soccer camp but can't deal with her mother's recent suicide; and Alexis Bledel is wonderful as Lena, who goes off to Greece and falls for hunky Michael Nady, against her grandparents' wishes.  The whole cast works so well that it transcends what could have been a trivial character study, but with the expertise of the writers and the film-makers, TRAVELING PANTS is a surprising wonder!",5,ONE SIZE FITS ALL,1131494400,"11 9, 2005",2005,1470,"['ultimate', 'chick', 'flick', ""n't"", 'mean', 'redblooded', 'American', 'males', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'entertained', 'excellence', 'intelligent', 'script', 'tasteful', 'direction', 'marvelous', 'cast', 'SISTERHOOD', 'usual', 'teen', 'flick', 'smart', 'witty', 'poignant', 'elegant', 'film', 'power', 'friendship', 'course', 'magic', 'denims', 'What', 'delightful', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'focus', 'girls', 'friends', 'families', 'girl', 'personality', 'given', 'time', 'develop', 'feel', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'Jenna', 'Boyd', 'are', 'superb', 'video-hopeful', 'young', 'friend', 'who', 'dying', 'leukemia', 'schmaltz', 'fake', 'tears', 'here', 'genuine', 'regard', 'life', 'depicted', 'America', 'Carrera', 'overweight', 'girl', 'who', 'spend', 'summer', 'estranged', 'father', 'out', 'got', 'whole', 'new', 'life', 'planned', 'girlfriend', 'Nancy', 'Travis', 'children', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'good', 'conflicted', 'father', 'Blake', 'Lively', 'seemingly', 'who', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'coach', 'summer', 'soccer', 'camp', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'mother', 'recent', 'suicide', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'wonderful', 'Lena', 'who', 'Greece', 'hunky', 'Michael', 'Nady', 'grandparents', 'wishes', 'whole', 'cast', 'works', 'so', 'well', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trivial', 'character', 'study', 'expertise', 'writers', 'film-makers', 'TRAVELING', 'PANTS', 'surprising', 'wonder']",N/A
928340,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000AM4PEK,mirasreviews,"[2, 2]","""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" is based on Ann Brashares' novel of four young women whose friendship binds them during their first summer apart. Bridget, Lena, Tibby, and Carmen have been inseparable since infancy and shared everything as children. Now they are 16 years old and about to go their separate ways for the summer. While out shopping one day, the girls find a pair of old jeans that inexplicably fits all their different shapes and sizes perfectly. They take on the jeans as a sort of good luck charm and symbol of their friendship and agree to share them over the course of the summer. Gorgeous, confident Bridget (Blake Lively) goes to soccer camp in Mexico. Demure, conservative Lena (Alexis Bledel) is off to visit her grandparents in Greece. Friendly, dramatic Carmen (America Ferrara) spends the summer with her father in South Carolina. And angsty, cynical Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) stays home and takes a job stocking shelves at a discount superstore while she works on a documentary film project. The jeans go back-and-forth, round-and-round, witnessing the girls' adventures and heartaches.The shape-shifting jeans seemed less of a contrivance to me than the idea that these four women with such disparate personalities and interests would be best friends. That's the artistic license that Anne Brashare has taken with the ""sisterhood"". ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" is part coming-of-age tale, part girlish melodrama. The depiction of the characters is respectful of their independence, emotional lives, and choices. I wondered what a young person's perspective on this film might be, so I thought about whether I would have liked it when I was 16. Frankly, the answer is no. I liked films about ideas, and ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" is a film about emotions. I would have thought it trite and saccharine when I was a teenager. Bridget, Lena, Carmen, and Tibby are not the most sophisticated or smartest young people. Nor are they  the least. It seems author Ann Brashares was aiming at average middle class. I think the girls' behavior is credible for 16-year-olds, in any case. Audiences like to see people onscreen who are a little more sophisticated than themselves, so I expect the film will appeal to pre-teen girls and younger teenagers more than the over-16 set.The DVD (Warner Home Video 2005): Bonus features include 4 featurettes, 8 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, and a theatrical trailer (12  minutes). In ""Fun on the Set"" (4  minutes), director Ken Kwapis and the cast talk about camaraderie on the set. ""Suckumentary"" (7 minutes) is the finished documentary on ""losers"" that Tibby was making in the film. In ""Sisters, Secrets, and the Traveling Pants: A Video Commentary"" (17 minutes), Alexis Bledel, Amber Tamblyn, and America Ferrara comment on 7 selected scenes from the film.

That I knew it'd be a totally fun thing to do with my mother while I was buzzing on booze.  I'm a 24 year old male and I had a great time at this film.  It's fun, it's heartwarming, and at just the right times it brings tears to your eyes.  Is it a cheesy ""chick-flick?""  Yes, I must admit that it is, but at the same time it's almost more than that.  This movie believes in dreams.  It shows that friendship, love, and and believing in yourself are still worth something in this manic world that we live in today.  Of course those thigns aren't worth a darn without Christ, but that's a different story altogether...moving on...This was a fun movie.  Any guy who doesn't think so should at least rent it for an evening.  It'd be a great date flick to get a girl to curl up next to you on a cold night next to the fireplace!  And any girl who wants to curl up next to that special guy should rent it because I promise he'll be in the mood to hold you while the snow falls outside after watching this baby.

The movie tells the story of 4 girls who make a pact to send a pair of pants that magically fits them to each other over the summer.  They are supposed to bring them luck.  What some of them find out, is that rather than bad luck, the pants bring them difficult situations that later bring them resolve with bigger issues in their life.The movie is very choppy and so if you don't like movies that jump abruptly from one girl in Greece to the next in Mexico, etc, then this movie is not for you.I had a major issue with this movie; it was completely cheesy at times that just made the whole movie seem ridiculous to me and my wife.  For example, at the end, one of the girls dog grabs her jeans from her bed and runs out of the house with them several blocks until the dog stops at the man who she met in Mexico.  Just completely ridiculous.  If you don't mind scenes that don't fit real life but fit the vision the director is trying to convey, however cheesy, then you'll like this movie.Lastly, I was very interested that although one of the men the girls met could be charged with statutory rape, the movie never addresses this other than having the girl say, ""I never told you to stop"" or something like that.

It defiantely has everything that a teen movie should have and that alot don't have.The movie starts off with them looking for something to keep them tied together while they are away from each other during the summer. So imagine their suprise when they find a pair of pants that can magically fit them all. As they all start to wear the pants you start to think that they aren't that magical. Lena is the first to get them and while she is wearing them she nearly drowns but luckily she is saved by a guy whom she starts to fall in love with, but their romance can not be because of a fued between their families(very Romeo and Juliet). Then Tibby gets the pants. While having the pants she meets Bailey who passed out on aisle at the place where Tibby works. Soon Bailey is following Tibby around and she finds it very annoying. But when she finds out Bailey has lukemia her perspective on Bailey and the world in general starts to change. After having the pants for a week Tibby sends them to Carmen who is with her father in South Carolina. Carmen thinks the pants can help her and maybe she is right but while wearing them she sees her father with his soon to be new family and breaks the window. The last to have the pants is Bridget. Bridget meets a guy whom she has fallen for but he is a coach at the camp she is at and so they aren't supposed to be together either.Overall the movie is very great.

Case in point: I get this movie, I mean it really hit home with me in a lot of ways (some too personal to divulge in a forum such as this).Of course, it is aimed at younger girls and I hope they take some of it's lessons to heart.  Not the least of which is how tricky and manipulative males can be - boys do love their games don't they?  (Hence the soccer motif, a metaphor of the 'battle of the sexes' as it were.)  We all know that America Ferrera became the unlikely breakout star, going on to massive popularity and acclaim in ""Ugly Betty"".  I won't dwell on it, except to say it is truly gratifying to see a fellow 'big-boned gal' make it in the perpetually thin entertainment industry.  She is stunningly effective in this film, as a young girl struggling with divorced parents and a father that doesn't want to fully accept her due to her ethnicity.  Very touching, you will need tissue nearby.But I can't forgot to mention the sweet work from the other three.  Amber Tamblyn is at first a typical ""emo kid"" - wallowing in teenage angst as she works to create a documentary video about her summer working in a discount drugstore.  It seems like a wasted effort until she strikes up a fascinating friendship with an unhealthy younger girl (played by the truly impressive Jenna Boyd).The other breakout semi-star is Blake Lively (Tamblyn was already established when the movie came out, as was Alexis Bledel of Gilmore Girls).  Ms. Lively is currently featured on the show ""Gossip Girl"".  In the movie, her summer is spent in Mexico at a soccer camp.  She gets in over her head after excessive flirting, basically forcing herself into a premature decision to express herself in a physically intimate manner (tame as I can put it) with a young male soccer player.  I found this segment to be possibly the most heartbreaking, as it brought back some memories I hadn't confronted in a long, long while.  Such is life (though I was not the stunning beauty that Blake so apparently is, God bless her).Speaking of the Gilmore Girl herself, Alexis Bledel, she goes to Italy for the summer - I found this to be rather the weakest plotline (don't shoot me, Alexis fans!).  She has a weird relationship with an Italian 'playa' and basically I just didn't feel any emotional attachment to the whole affair.

928363,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000AM4PEK,Tsuyoshi,"[10, 10]","`Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants' is a sweet and charming film. I am a middle-aged male living in Japan, but I think I know that much. Don't dismiss this well-made film just because it is (or seems) made for a certain group of target audience, perhaps for teenage girls in this case. It is sugar-coated, sure it is, but it contains something different in that.Four girls are not a rare situation for story. About ten years ago we had 'Now and Then' and of course, there is always a classic tale of Alcott. This film, however, has one unique common thread throughout, and that is one pair of jeans worn by four 16-year-old girls living in Maryland. As the film begins, these girls are going to spend summer in four different places - Greece, Mexico, South Carolina, and Maryland (one stays at home) but before doing so, they decide to wear the newly-bought jeans according to the ten rules they made. Just like true sisterhood.But the charms of the film come from the four young talents, Amber Tamblyn, America Ferrera, Blake Lively, and Alexis Bledel. I must say some parts of their characters are clich&eacute;d ones, such as a surly girl Tibby working at supermarket, making a `suckmentary' of the people she thinks are boring; Carmen, who goes to her divorced father who is going to marry again; a soccer player Bridget who flirts with a handsome coach; and timid Lena who finds a love in Greece, and the courage to say what she really thinks. You can say you have heard similar stories told in books and films, and if you do, you would be excused. But at the same time you will find that the four girls are so real and charming in more than one way, not what you call `types' or `stock characters.'But you will prefer one to the others. I find Tibby's character most impressive. She meets an equally surly girl (fantastic Jenna Boyd), self-appointed `assistant' of her documentary film, and their relations are sincerely described. You may call it a tearjerker (because it is), but it is a good one, for which reason they should be praised.As other reviewers say, it is based on the beloved bestselling book, but I confess I haven't read it. Maybe I should, or maybe not. As far as the film is concerned, however, it is sweet and heart-warming, and should be seen by many people, regardless of age and sex.",5,Sweet and Charming Tales Sincerely Told,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,2312,"['Sisterhood', 'Traveling', 'Pants', 'sweet', 'charming', 'film', 'am', 'middle-aged', 'male', 'living', 'Japan', 'think', 'know', 'much', 'Do', ""n't"", 'dismiss', 'well-made', 'film', 'just', 'made', 'certain', 'group', 'target', 'audience', 'perhaps', 'teenage', 'girls', 'case', 'sugar-coated', 'sure', 'something', 'different', 'that.Four', 'girls', 'are', 'not', 'rare', 'situation', 'story', 'ten', 'years', 'had', ""'Now"", 'Then', 'course', 'always', 'classic', 'tale', 'Alcott', 'film', 'however', 'one', 'unique', 'common', 'thread', 'one', 'pair', 'jeans', 'worn', 'four', '16-year-old', 'girls', 'living', 'Maryland', 'film', 'girls', 'are', 'going', 'spend', 'summer', 'four', 'different', 'places', 'Greece', 'Mexico', 'South', 'Carolina', 'Maryland', 'one', 'home', 'doing', 'so', 'decide', 'wear', 'newly-bought', 'jeans', 'according', 'ten', 'rules', 'made', 'Just', 'true', 'sisterhood.But', 'charms', 'film', 'come', 'four', 'young', 'talents', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'America', 'Ferrera', 'Blake', 'Lively', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'must', 'say', 'parts', 'characters', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'ones', 'such', 'surly', 'girl', 'Tibby', 'working', 'supermarket', 'making', 'suckmentary', 'people', 'are', 'boring', 'Carmen', 'who', 'divorced', 'father', 'who', 'going', 'marry', 'again', 'soccer', 'player', 'Bridget', 'who', 'handsome', 'coach', 'timid', 'Lena', 'who', 'love', 'Greece', 'courage', 'say', 'what', 'really', 'can', 'say', 'have', 'heard', 'similar', 'stories', 'told', 'books', 'films', 'do', 'would', 'be', 'excused', 'same', 'time', 'will', 'find', 'four', 'girls', 'are', 'so', 'real', 'charming', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'not', 'what', 'call', 'types', 'stock', 'characters', 'will', 'prefer', 'one', 'others', 'find', 'Tibby', 'character', 'most', 'impressive', 'equally', 'surly', 'girl', 'fantastic', 'Jenna', 'Boyd', 'self-appointed', 'assistant', 'documentary', 'film', 'relations', 'are', 'sincerely', 'described', 'may', 'call', 'tearjerker', 'good', 'one', 'reason', 'should', 'be', 'other', 'reviewers', 'say', 'based', 'beloved', 'bestselling', 'book', 'confess', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Maybe', 'should', 'maybe', 'not', 'As', 'far', 'film', 'concerned', 'however', 'sweet', 'heart-warming', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'many', 'people', 'regardless', 'age', 'sex']",N/A
