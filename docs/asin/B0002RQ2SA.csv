We were so pleased with these DVDs!Years ago, when Thomas was new and before we had any children, we used to see it on TV and think how cute it was.  But by the time we had children, it had changed considerably.  We still like the newer Thomas stories, of course, but nothing compares to the old ones.  My favorite in this set is The Sad Story of Henry because it is just so funny.I highly recommend this set to anyone who is a new or old fan of Thomas.  You will be so glad you have it!",5,Thomas as he was meant to be!,1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,557,"['just', 'got', 'set', 'today', 'have', 'already', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'were', 'so', 'pleased', 'DVDs', 'Years', 'ago', 'when', 'Thomas', 'was', 'new', 'had', 'children', 'used', 'see', 'TV', 'think', 'how', 'cute', 'was', 'time', 'had', 'children', 'had', 'changed', 'considerably', 'still', 'newer', 'Thomas', 'stories', 'course', 'nothing', 'old', 'ones', 'favorite', 'set', 'Sad', 'Story', 'Henry', 'just', 'so', 'funny.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'set', 'anyone', 'who', 'new', 'old', 'fan', 'Thomas', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'glad', 'have']",Thomas The Tank Engine And Friends - The Early Years

Thomas and all his friends are in beautiful color--Gordon, Henry, and more. If you are contemplating giving this as a Christmas gift, the very last episode is Thomas' Christmas Party. Ringo Starr narrates and does a fantastic job. Disc three features some interactive games, stories and activities.",5,Thomas the Tank is great,1258761600,"11 21, 2009",2009,435,"['have', 'little', 'one', 'Thomas', 'Tank', 'three', 'disc', 'set', 'features', '26', 'original', 'episodes', 'beginning', 'series', 'Thomas', 'friends', 'are', 'beautiful', 'color', 'Gordon', 'Henry', 'more', 'are', 'contemplating', 'giving', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'very', 'last', 'episode', 'Thomas', 'Christmas', 'Party', 'Ringo', 'Starr', 'narrates', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Disc', 'three', 'interactive', 'games', 'stories', 'activities']",Thomas The Tank Engine And Friends - The Early Years
843771,A39RL9O9N83W5,B0002RQ2SA,Jill,"[0, 0]","I bought this CD for my two year old who loves Thomas. It has 26 episodes so it will take a long time for him to get to watch it all but I bought used and price was within my price range. As another reviewer stated, they call Sir Topham Hatt, the Fat Controller, so you may not be thrilled with this version or you can just discuss with your child that our culture does not think this name is polite. Some of these episodes are a little darker than the ones that they currently show on television but I find them to be more interesting. I ordered on the 14th and received on the 17th.

843772,A3QTP2CI1BDV0M,B0002RQ2SA,"Jim O'Brien ""JamesMark""","[0, 0]","I would recommend this product for all children ... and all those who are children at heart.This three DVD set contains the first season (26 episodes) of ""Thomas the Tank Engine"" as it was originally broadcast on British television in 1984 ... and it is fun and it is wonderful.The Island of Sodor ... where these wonderful adventures take place ... would undergo some changes in the coming years, but here ... in its first year ... Thomas and his friends are at their innocent best.Ringo Starr is the narrator here, and his charm and good nature fit perfectly with the simple innocence of the stories.  My favorite is ""Thomas & Bertie"" but ""Thomas Goes Fishing"", ""Thomas in Trouble"", and ""Coal"" are good too.Ringo's stint as storyteller lasted only two seasons (sniff), but those 52 episodes are the ones most worth owning.  And after viewing the 26 episodes included here, I am sure you will agree that Thomas is ... a really useful engine.",5,Excellent ...

843774,A3J029KBNG5MNP,B0002RQ2SA,Mr. Bey,"[47, 50]",I already own every episode form the Ringo Starr era on the old videos but I plan on purchasing this DVD. The really funny thing is out of the five Ringo Starr videos made the three that were the best were all stopped being made. Tenders & Turntables is my favorite Thomas video but Thomas Breaks The Rules and Better Late then Never were my other too favorites. I'm really happy this is being made because I know there all a lot of you who never got copies of these great movies and now you are able to see the pure goodness Thomas used to be. I gurantee if you buy this set or the old videos you will want Thomas back to the way it was. If you think the new Thomas movies are good be prepared to be blown away.,5,Now This is What I've Waited For,1101340800,"11 25, 2004",2004,712,"['already', 'own', 'episode', 'form', 'Ringo', 'Starr', 'era', 'old', 'videos', 'plan', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'really', 'funny', 'thing', 'five', 'Ringo', 'Starr', 'videos', 'made', 'three', 'were', 'best', 'were', 'stopped', 'being', 'made', 'Tenders', 'Turntables', 'favorite', 'Thomas', 'video', 'Thomas', 'Breaks', 'Rules', 'Better', 'Late', 'then', 'Never', 'were', 'other', 'too', ""'m"", 'really', 'happy', 'being', 'made', 'know', 'there', 'lot', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'copies', 'great', 'movies', 'now', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'pure', 'goodness', 'Thomas', 'used', 'be', 'gurantee', 'buy', 'set', 'old', 'videos', 'will', 'want', 'Thomas', 'back', 'way', 'was', 'think', 'new', 'Thomas', 'movies', 'are', 'good', 'be', 'prepared', 'be', 'blown', 'away']",Thomas The Tank Engine And Friends - The Early Years
