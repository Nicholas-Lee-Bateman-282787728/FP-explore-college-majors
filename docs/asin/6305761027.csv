It's portrayal of small town wannabees (of a certain ethnic group trying to act like they're part of another ethnic group) is about as accurate as you're going to get. I grew up in the burbs and while the characters may seem like they're exaggerated, from my experience, they're not. No one else had the initiative to make a movie about this absolutely hilarious demographic which is so criminally overlooked in comedies. The acting is just amazing all the way around, the script and language are right on the money. It's just an absolutely hilarious tale of wannabees getting their behinds handed to them and it is done so well.",5,Ingenious!,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,722,"['one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'one', 'favorites', 'portrayal', 'small', 'town', 'wannabees', 'certain', 'ethnic', 'group', 'trying', 'act', ""'re"", 'part', 'ethnic', 'group', 'as', 'accurate', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'grew', 'up', 'burbs', 'characters', 'may', 'seem', ""'re"", 'exaggerated', 'experience', ""'re"", 'not', 'one', 'else', 'had', 'initiative', 'make', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'demographic', 'so', 'criminally', 'overlooked', 'comedies', 'acting', 'just', 'amazing', 'way', 'script', 'language', 'are', 'right', 'money', 'just', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'tale', 'wannabees', 'getting', 'behinds', 'handed', 'done', 'so', 'well']",Whiteboyz VHS

Even she couldn't save this movie.  It was about a group of white but wanna-be black teens who think they should move to Chicago and become pro rappers.  You'd think this idea could be a humorous movie but it wasn't, it was just dumb.  I couldn't tell what was a joke and what was a joke and what wasn't.

It sounded hilarious, so when I saw it advertised for 5 dollars at the store, I figured, &quot;What the heck?&quot;  What I saw was both hilarious and true at the same time, but it had its moments of annoyance.  Basically, it follows the adventures of 3 white kids from Iowa perpetrating the image of a &quot;gangsta&quot;.  They finally go on a road trip to Chicago to the Cabrini Green projects and find out it ain't &quot;all good in the 'hood&quot;.
