480814,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,630584156X,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[3, 3]","I saw this in the early 1980s. I beleive after I saw ""First Blood"" at theater and this as a video store rental, I then realized it came out pre-Stallone version. This version is family friendly as it has hardly anything near violence. Exceptional cast with Dirk Benedict, Linda Blair, Ben Johnson, Matt Clark, and others you will recognize. Mostly comical and plenty of action. It is more like watching the ""Dukes of Hazzard"" than ""First Blood"". I recommend you buy it immediately if you want the DVD as it seems the first editions are about sold out so it may go out of print for awhile since sales haven't been great because this is a sleeper of a movie. I mean that it is not well known, because half the junk coming out on DVD does put me to sleep, this movie is great fun to watch. I ordered my DVD since they only have a few copies left.The story is a Viet Nam vet is travelling by hitchhiking across country. He is wearing his Special Forces jacket from the Army. When he enters a small town he is harassed by some locals looking to pick on someone. In more of a self defence move than a threatening action he beats the bullies up and flee's the town. They chase after him into the woods where he sets traps that slow them down in funny ways rather than the deadly variety in ""First Blood"". Although the Viet Nam war was becoming unpopular back in the late 60s to early 70s, the irony here is small town folks were not the ones that would treat a vet this way. That might have happened in a large city, but this movie implausible or not since ""First Blood"" is definitely implausable, this movie is very entertaining. The DVD quality is excellent and includes a commentary in the way of extras. TAddendum: This DVD has gone out of print. Do not pay more than $15.00 for it. It was selling for about $9.00 or less before it went out of print. Anyone wanting more than around $15-20 is just being excessively greedy. I am sure it will become available again. You may be able to rent it until then.  - C.

A simple story of a Vietnam Vet who comes through town only to get picked on by the local ""good ole boys"" and ends up in a small-scale war with them, it's also humorous.  Linda Blair gives a credible performance as the young widow of another vet whose father is the local rich guy.  Her small son is a doll and the whole movie is one that most anyone in the family would enjoy.  For once, the sheriff in the small town is not the bad guy (although his deputy isn't all that likeable!) and the action is not dependant on murder and mayhem--but lots of stuff gets blown up and there are enough shots fired to please action film lovers.

480817,A5CWA7CNUXLWW,630584156X,"Edward Lindo ""Patriot""","[2, 2]","This movie is one of my all time favorites. I bought it just after it was released and sadly now it is out of print. This movie is loaded with talent. Dirk Bennedict from Battlestar Galactica (The original) and the A-Team. Linda Blair who made a name for herself in the Exorcist. Ben Johnson who played along side John Wayne, as Blair's father in law. Matt Clark who played a stellar comical role as Cecil. Richard Farnsworth as a very sympathetic sheriff. This movie is just fun to watch for any age. Unlike First Blood (which it has been compared to), there is no graphic violence, just a lot of action. Another plus is the Audio Commentary with Bennedict, Blair and the director speaking. The stunts were amazing for a low budget film and the acting was top notch from the stars to the supporting cast down to the extras.

480818,AMTIDEOY4T3G2,630584156X,Grant Allan,"[16, 17]","Just a little spooky, not to mention blatant, when you compare this movie and Sylvester Stallones &quot;First Blood&quot; and realise that &quot;Ruckus&quot; was made 2 years earlier. Unfortunately this movie was not the huge smash hit that &quot;First Blood&quot; was due to studio problems, delayed release and little, if any advertising. However, I am throwing forth a challenge.....watch both these movies today and you will realise that only one of them stood the test of time. Clue for you.....it wasn't &quot;First Blood&quot;. Where this movie is still entertaining, the other seems amateurish at best.The lack of graphic violence in &quot;Ruckus&quot; works in it's favour, with bloodshed impled more-so than filling the screen. Also, the odds are a little more believable, what with one man versus 2 or 3 police officers and a couple of car loads of redneck hoons as opposed to Stallones victory over an entire small cities police force and numerous army divisions. Another thing that works well in Ruckus is the introduction of a female presence, being none other than the scrumptious Linda Blair, and a light romance plot line making it more female friendly. Most girls who would refuse to sit through a Rambo flick wouldn't mind watching this even though there isn't enough romance to make it soppy. You've gotta love a romance played out on dirt bikes :-)The commentary on the DVD is enjoyable also. When the movies maker and lead actor and actress get together, you can feel the sense of fun they had making this movie. They chat about the plot line, budget, competition and good times had by all making this fun little flick.All in all, if you are the sort of person that let's box office takings and talentless movie reviewers make your decisions for you, I recommend you steer clear. If you like making your own decisions and enjoy good, pure entertainment, go for it. A truly fun movie !
