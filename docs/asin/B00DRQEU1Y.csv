1660736,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00DRQEU1Y,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[2, 5]","That's right!  Another serial picture story!  Oh, they're all the rage these days, don't you know?  Why, if Hollywood's version of America is any indication, one could easily come to the conclusion that these United States are just chocked full of serial killers waiting to rise up and strike out at defenseless women everywhere for their constant laughing at the size of men's penises!  For their snubbing us when we asked them out for a dinner and a movie!  For their not being enough like our mothers!  You name it, and no doubt some Hollywood suit envisioned men would kill for it.  And that's the basic problem with SHIVER - as much as I wanted to like it more than I did, it all feels like we've been here before.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)The Gryphon (played like your typical deranged civil servant by John Jarratt) is fascinated with young, beautiful women, especially since one broke his heart by snubbing his request for a date twelve years ago.  Since that time, he's become so enamored with women that he's taken to garroting off their heads and storing them in jars!  However, things take a turn toward the matrimonial when he meets Wendy Allen (the lovely Danielle Harris), his potential next victim who surprisingly turns out to be his intellectual equal.  Instead of killing her, he decides he wants to have her for his very own ... and unless police detective Delgado (Casper Van Dien) can finally catch the guy, the Gryphon just might rule the day!It's hard to find much to say about SHIVER.  Sadly, it's an entirely forgettable affair.  Oh, it entertains well enough while you're watching it, but I suspect it's the kind of thing that'll enjoy a modest reputation on home video - I can already hear video store clerks recommending it in my mind's eye to anyone who asks about a good thriller - and then it'll end up being banished to the shelves where all of the other relatively untouched direct-to-DVD releases wait for rediscovery.  There really aren't all that many problems I could tick off; it's just that it's entirely drenched in equal parts mediocrity as it is blood.  The performances?  Just fine.  The script?  Just fine.  The body count?  Just fine.  All of it is based on the book by Brian Harper ... which I suspect is probably a `just fine' read, too.I will say that I haven't seen that big a chin on Casper Van Dien since Bruce Campbell burst on to the scene.  In the very least, I hope he was paid extra to swing that thing around.SHIVER (2013) is produced by Bandersnatch FilmCo, Cyclone Productions, and Loaded Image Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled through RLJ Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications, the film looks and sounds mostly solid - there are a few scenes early in the picture wherein telephonic and cassette tape (???) dialogue is recorded, and it is a bit difficult to hear, as well as a few sequences where our serial killer whispers to the women before dispatching them.  Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that SHIVER has enjoyed some modest acclaim from the festival circuit: Ms. Harris won Best Actress at the Eerie Horror Film Festival, and the film won Most Shocking at the Crypticon Film Festival as well as being nominated for Best Film at the Burbank International Film Festival.  To my surprise, the disc comes with absolutely no special features, not even a theatrical trailer: that's pretty rare in this day and age.RECOMMENDED.  Sorry to say but SHIVER didn't make me shiver in the slightest.  That isn't to say it doesn't deliver on its premise.  It's a perfectly adequate way to spend about 90 minutes exploring yet one more derivation on the popular serial killer premise.  It's far from perfect, but I've seen vastly less interesting thrillers as well.  Don't expect anything new, and you're likely to feel the same as I.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Image Entertainment and RLJ Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of SHIVER by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,"Oh, Look!

1660737,A20EZJ8Z4F5JB7,B00DRQEU1Y,J. Gregory,"[4, 7]","Well, I guess I can start off by saying that I can call myself one of Danielle Harris' biggest fans and I was waiting to see this movie since 2010!!! And now that I've finally seen it, all I can say is WOW!!!! It was different than any other movie that I've seen before which is good. And seeing Danielle play the role she played,(Wendy Alden) it weird cause it was the first kind of role that I've seen her in that's like a Sidney Prescott role!! Her acting was different, and the Wendy character was very different than anything I've seen her play in every way! Even though this killer is a human, cause I'm not scared of seeing a normal person coming at you or anything but the way the killer was and how good the actor did as the killer, was amazing and ACTUALLY CREEPY!! The whole movie was disturbing. haha! I loved it. I loved it very much and I can't help but give it 5 stars cause it was that good to me. lol! The only thing I could say about it, was that the dialogue was a little off. I mean, the lines seemed sometimes a little silly. But in the end, it was good. I guess I think it was off cause the story is based on the book. And lots of books have interesting and wonderfully over the top dialogue cause it's different than watching a movie cause you're reading the book! But so, I thought Danielle said the lines very well at least. haha! :)And I loved the ending. I was scared there was gonna be a stupid or a weird ending cause the recent movies I've seen, their endings are not satisfying. So, I was very pleased with the end. ;) If you are thinking of watching this movie for any reason like if you love Danielle Harris, WATCH IT!!!!! &lt;3",5,"Wow, Wow And Just Wow!",1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,1661,"['Well', 'guess', 'can', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'can', 'call', 'one', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'biggest', 'fans', 'was', 'waiting', 'see', 'movie', '2010', 'now', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'seen', 'can', 'say', 'WOW', 'was', 'different', 'other', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'good', 'seeing', 'Danielle', 'play', 'role', 'played', 'Wendy', 'Alden', 'weird', 'cause', 'was', 'first', 'kind', 'role', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Sidney', 'Prescott', 'role', 'acting', 'was', 'different', 'Wendy', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'way', 'Even', 'killer', 'human', 'cause', ""'m"", 'not', 'scared', 'seeing', 'normal', 'person', 'coming', 'anything', 'way', 'killer', 'was', 'how', 'good', 'actor', 'did', 'killer', 'was', 'amazing', 'ACTUALLY', 'CREEPY', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'disturbing', 'haha', 'loved', 'loved', 'very', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'cause', 'was', 'good', 'lol', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'say', 'was', 'dialogue', 'was', 'little', 'off', 'mean', 'lines', 'seemed', 'sometimes', 'little', 'silly', 'end', 'was', 'good', 'guess', 'think', 'was', 'off', 'cause', 'story', 'based', 'book', 'lots', 'books', 'have', 'interesting', 'wonderfully', 'top', 'dialogue', 'cause', 'different', 'watching', 'movie', 'cause', ""'re"", 'reading', 'book', 'so', 'thought', 'Danielle', 'said', 'lines', 'very', 'well', 'least', 'haha', 'loved', 'ending', 'was', 'scared', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'stupid', 'weird', 'ending', 'cause', 'recent', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'endings', 'are', 'not', 'satisfying', 'So', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'end', 'are', 'thinking', 'watching', 'movie', 'reason', 'love', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'WATCH', 'IT', 'lt', '3']",Shiver

Despite some of the reviews I've read, this is actually a very good film, despite the budget. Danielle was top notch as usual (though I love her in even the less than stellar films she's done). The story was interesting and thrilling, and the performances were believable. I didn't find much of the film to be scary but it did build suspense very well. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this film to others. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I'd say it's certainly worth a watch.

1660740,A2H7TYN6T4K4MH,B00DRQEU1Y,Scott Solomon,"[3, 5]",Well let me start off saying I really enjoyed Danielle Harris's performance. She did a great job. What surprised me is that Casper and Rae's acting was not very good. Rae's acting was very low energy and almost put me to sleep. What happened to the woman who starred with Arnold way back when when she was full of zest and energy. She made me feel like she didn't even want to be acting in this film. Casper's performance wasn't much better. Totally mis casted in this role. He was nowhere near as good as he was in Starship Troopers. His performance was boring and it appeared to me he didnt really know how a detective should act. Now here's my biggest problem with this film. Whoever casted the serial killer role should have their head examined or better yet quit and go to work selling hamburgers for McDonalds!!!. The actor and I use that term loosely looked like a 70 year old sterno bum that any 15 year old could beat up. He did not look the part and his acting was awful. Why anyone would cast him in this role is beyond me. The film itself was obviousally low budget and really no great surprises. Just something that has been done a million times before and this version was done poorly. I cant believe this got so many good reviews. The only thnig good was Danielle's acting. She really deserves to bbe cast in a big budget film. There is some depth to her acting. If you want to watch this film I'd wait until it comes to red box for $1.30This review is simply my opinion.
