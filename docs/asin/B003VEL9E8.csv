1367161,A16Z7PYQH36IYU,B003VEL9E8,Adam J. Rendall,"[0, 0]","Looking at just the plot, this movie is fairly average.  A sensational interpretation of the Stanford Prison Experiment?  Some pretty cheesy dialogue? A splash of gay panic?  All check. But look at that cast...Forrest Whitaker has the standout performance here.  Take his character from Ghost Dog and replace the glorified samurai ethic with a suppressed semi-sexual desire for dominance, and you have a good starting point for his character here.  A quiet, seemingly good-natured creepiness exudes from him that you rarely see outside public transportation.Adrien Brody, of course, is a great actor.  I've yet to see anything he's acted poorly in.  He gets some boring lines in this movie, but he acts them damn well.And a few bonus points to Fisher Stevens for doing his best 70's Zimbardo impersonation.  Really, both do a really good job of conveying a scientist that has possibly gone a bit nuts.And don't forget the jerk from Easy A, and the bad guy from Crank: High Voltage, and wasn't that guy in Black Snake Moan?  Really, the rest of the cast is just kind of there, but Whitaker and Brody carry a lot of this movie.

The objective is to create a prison like environment in which there are two groups, the prisoners and the guards. Although there are rules but these rules are open to interpretation.

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","The Experiment lives up to its name in more ways than one.It's about a group of people who get paid a large sum of money to pretend to be either prisoners or prison guards.  Which one it is depends on what the assignment paper says.  It turns out Adrien Brody's character becomes the innocent prisoner and Forest Whitaker's character becomes the power-hungry prison guard.While the two sides are taking their respective role, video cameras from above are watching closely the actions of every person in the prison system.That's basically all I really want to say about the storyline because revealing anything more would definitely spoil the movie for everyone.  Just know that there's several moments of power abuse that leads to humiliation, and one scene in particular involves urination and it's totally disgraceful.The Experiment is probably best described as a spin on your typical prison-type storyline.  The storyline concerning a power struggle is obviously the aspect that stands out above everything else.  In all other areas however, this is exactly what you'd expect out of a good suspense- incredibly violent and action-packed, and the acting is really good throughout every single segment.It's a quality film with a different take on an age old storyline that centers around a prison and the mistreatment of others.  The only difference between this film and the others is that the prisoners are actually the innocent ones in this case.

Velasquez,"[2, 2]","What would so-called normal people do if subjected to oppressive conditions, provided that they are well paid for it, and that their actions are safely supervised, as to avoid serious consequences? Well, that is precisely what some behaviorists have done in their research throughout history, sometimes for the good mankind, and sometimes for unsound reasons. ""The Experiment"" partially answers some of the many questions in regards to these matters, providing a shocking and unforgettable look at what can happen inside a prison if conditions get out of hand.Travis (Adrien Brody) is an easy-going fellow who just lost his job at a retirement home. While looking for a new one, he finds an ad in a newspaper which says, ""Subjects wanted for behavioral experiment. Two weeks, no experience necessary. Safe. $1,000 / Day.""  This sounds like a really good opportunity to Travis, an offer he can't refuse. He is easily selected to participate in the experiment, and Dr. Archaleta (Fisher Stevens) informs the chosen group that they would be ""simulating the conditions of life inside a state penitentiary."" They are told, among other things, that some will not have civil rights, that no violence is allowed, and that not following directives will cause their immediate dismissal from the experiment. In addition, individuals who served time in prison are not allowed. Easy... Right?  After all, it is only two-weeks.Travis becomes friends with Barris (Forest Whitaker) before going into confinement. However, once inside the prison, some men are assigned to be prisoners and others are selected to be guards. Travis becomes part of the prisoner group and Barris will be a guard; this would be a true test of their friendship. With time, we realize that among the chosen men, there is an ex-con, a diabetic, and a psychopath. As you can imagine, this is a potentially volatile mix that will definitely compromise the experiment, affecting the behavior of the participants. Add to this that nobody wants to loose the $1,000 bucks per day that they were promised. In the end, one participant asks another, ""You still think we are higher in the evolutionary chain and monkeys?"" You'll have to figure out that one for yourself.""The Experiment"" provides food for thought and great entertainment. You will place yourself in the position of the experiment's participants, and would ask yourself what you would do in any given circumstance.

1367172,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003VEL9E8,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[10, 12]","In 1971, one of the most well-known and controversial psychological experiment's in the United States was conducted by Stanford University Professor Dr. Philip Zimbardo.  The experiment was known as the Stanford prison experiment and 24 undergraduate students participated in mock experiment in which they would play the role of guards and prisoners.  The goal was to promote disorientation, depersonalisation and deindivisualisation.The students playing the guards adapted to their role rather quickly and ended up humiliating, hurting and causing emotional and physical trauma to the students playing the prisoners and Dr. Zimbardo played a passive role and being a scientist and not stopping the experiment until the woman he was dating confronted him for passively allowing unethical acts to be performed under his direct supervision.The experiment lasted only six days and after the study was completed, the Dr. submitted his findings to the U.S. House Committee on Judiciary.Because of his experiment, the findings were quite important but also highly debated.  What made the students playing the guards become abusive and oppressive?  Was it because there were no clear instructions?  Were the guards playing a part of what they felt should be the role of a guard?  And this was within six days of the experiment that all hell broke loose.This experiment was covered in the novel ""Black Box"" by Mario Giordano and the novel would receive a 2001 German adaptation titled ""Das Experiment"".  The film is similar to 1971 the real Stanford Prison Experiment but in this case, the scientists play a passive role in observation of the inhuman and the guards not only become power hungry and oppressive to the prisoners but they go even further by killing.In 2010, the American remake titled ""The Experiment"" which is not necessarily a remake of the German hit film ""Das Experiment"" but inspired by the film and the Stanford Prison Experiment and is directed by ""Prison Break"" TV show writer Paul Scheuring (who also wrote the screenplay adaptation) and a film that will be direct-to-video starring Oscar winners Adrien Brody (""King Kong"", ""The Darjeeling Limited"", ""The Brothers Bloom"", ""Predators"") and Forest Whitaker (""Criminal Minds"", ""Vantage Point"", ""The Shield"", ""The Last King of Scotland"").""The Experiment"" revolves around 26 men who participate in a psychological study in which they can earn $14,000 if they continue to play the role of the prisoner and the guards for two weeks.  The study is done by Dr. Archaleta (played by Fisher Stevens) who is trying to examine how aggressive behavior is played out in an artificial prison setting.VIDEO:""The Experiment"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1) and the picture quality is wonderful.  You can see the detail in the skin of the faces of people, the stubble, the tattoos and anguish on the faces of the characters being oppressed.  The majority of the film is shot indoors but you do see vibrant colors more during Travis' dreams as he imagines Bay in India and we see the colors of the reds really pop.  But for the most part, the majority of the film is shot in a dreary prison set.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Experiment"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and although the majority of the film is dialogue-driven, there are some scenes in which we can hear the prisoners screaming at the guards to people getting beaten up and hit.  Even one scene with a piercing high noise when Travis is apprehended and about to be choked by one of the guards.  Overall, the film presents crisp, clear dialogue and music by Graeme Revell (""Pineapple Express"", ""Days of Wrath"", ""Eleventh Hour"", ""The Forgotten"").SPECIAL FEATURES:Unfortunately, ""The Experiment"" comes with no special features but does have BD-Live capability for those who want to register their Blu-ray for Sony Pictures Home Entertainment points or download trailers.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Experiment"" is a riveting film featuring a wonderful performance by Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker.  Forest Whitaker really does a great job of playing the bible-reading, calm and collected Baris who then changes and becomes this abusive and power hungry man.Both men do carry this film as the performances are needed because unlike ""Das Experiment"" or even the original true experiment that the film is inspired on, director and screenwriter Paul Scheuring unfortunately chooses to focus more on the inhumane practice of the guards as we see them not only become oppressive but also rapist, murders and for the most part, seeing good people turning bad.We know that this was the case in the original Stanford Prison Experiment in 1971 and the film does a great job showing that.  The problem is that they take the doctor and scientists out of the equation.With the real Stanford story, we know about the Dr. and him playing a passive role until he is confronted by his date who has ethical concerns in regards to his experiment and then seeing how he lost control over his own experiment and things gone awry.  In ""Das Experiment"", we see how the guards become oppressive but Dr. and scientist in this film have an integral role in which everything plays out in the end.In ""The Experiment"", we see Dr. Archaleta briefly in the film.  His job is to study the participants who will be playing the police and prisoners but the storyline goes nowhere with it, especially around the character Dr. Archaleta.  Why would this man allow one to be suffering from diabetes and having him grow sick?  Why would the Dr. allow such brutality to happen.  Yes, it happened in the Stanford test and ""Das Experiment"" but there are scientists that have their own reasoning and in this case, it was getting out of hand that murder, rape and other inhumane things were taking place and yet, no one stopped it.The whole chilling experiment was covered well in the film but I felt the storyline was not well-conceived, felt a bit rushed and the ending was not at all satisfying.  ""Das Experiment"" shows the repercussions towards the scientists who have let this experiment grow chaotic, inhumane and deadly and allows the viewer to put a face to the people behind the experiment.  With ""The Experiment"",  I was not satisfied how they chose to end the film and it was simply a lazy way to end the film and destroyed any potential of the film to achieve a thrilling ending like ""Das Experiment"".The Blu-ray release does sport very good picture quality and the dialogue is clear and understandable but for a newer film, was shocked that there were no special features at all.  It would have been wonderful for director/screenwriter Paul Scheuring to explain his thoughts on the making of the film especially the ending via an audio commentary but unfortunately, we are not giving anything extra for the film.  No interviews, no featurettes...nothing.Overall, ""The Experiment"" had so much potential, especially if it was inspired from ""Das Experiment"".  Even if they did a straight copy of the German film in English, viewers would have enjoyed a thrilling ending and a much more understandable plot.  But unfortunately, despite the wonderful performance by Adrian Brody and Forest Whitaker and also the thrilling scenes that involve both men, the film just doesn't give the viewer any satisfying closure  and the Blu-ray release has no special features at all.  So, much potential for this film but unfortunately, this release is best as a rental and not a keeper.",2,Blu-ray: Barebones release....

Quite often, the average individual believes he/she is altruistic and will always place the ideals and aspirations of society above their own. ""The Experiment"" is a mirror image of the human soul that suggests people may not be as magnanimous as they claim.""The Experiment"" is based on the 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment by Dr. Philip Zimbardo (Read Zimbardo's book, ""The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil"").  In Zimbardo's experiment, he showed that people are rule-bound more then they realize. More importantly, when average individuals are given a modicum of power, they tend to usurp the rights and choices of others.  This idea goes farther then the movie.  Look at Bernard Madoff, The Financial and Housing Industry debacle and the latest politician caught in a scandal dealing with the public trust. You think you're better, ""The Experiment"" says you're not.To adopt any concept dealing with human nature, whether it is becoming more magnetic, charismatic, or even diabolical, you have to study and understand human nature at its core.Watch and study ""The Experiment"".

Willard,"[21, 23]","When looking up the new releases here on Amazon, seeing this movie NOT on the few movies listed on the main page was a real mistake in my opinion. I even went to 3 stores looking for this movie and the first 2 had no idea what movie I was requesting and didn't even have it on release day! I saw a trailer for it a few months ago and immediately knew I had to have it.The basic story is: Volunteers will be paid for an experiment where they are put into a simulated prison experience. Stressfull challenges are then introduced throughout the experiment. If any physical attacks are observed between the guards and prisoners, the experiment will end and no one gets paid. We meet Adrian Brody and Forest Whitaker introducing themselves to one another prior to the experiment and we see that these are 2 very different people but there is a mutual respect forming. We then find out, some volunteers will be guards and some will be prisoners.Amazing performances by Adrien Brody, Forest Whitaker, Clifton Collins Jr. and many more supporting roles, will have you sitting on the edge of your seat through the whole movie. It is clear, at the beginning, some volunteers  are going to be trouble and as the movie moves along, power does corrupt even the best of the men but we feel for them because they are told, ""you will not get paid if you do not follow and enforce the rules.""I do NOT agree with Amazon's review that this movie ""never quite grabs hold"". By the end of the movie, I was almost in tears after watching men who respected each other at the beginning, couldn't even look each other in the eye by the end. There isn't much more to say.

1367177,AE5A9FB765HMF,B003VEL9E8,gex144,"[1, 1]","I watched the German original before seeing this remake, so my opinion is probably biased.  But regardless, I strongly felt that this movie falls very short of being as good as the original.  Where to begin?First off: SPOILERS!Starting with the opening credits, that lets me know exactly what I'm in for.  The credits start with showing animals fighting each other. Ok, it sets the mood for something disturbing and unsettling, plus implying the whole ""We're like animals"" theme.  This isn't a subtle movie, a lot of things from the opening credits to several of the last lines in the movie are going to state this.  It doesn't start out too blatant and obvious with its messaging, but trust me, it will become that way.In the original movie our main character was a reporter turned taxi driver who still has connections with his news company.  When he gets a hold of the paper add for the experiment, he figures it's a good way to get a good story and plenty of money to boot to help him with his financial situation.  In this remake, Adrien Brody just plays an ex-psychiatrist who needs money, and discovers the add for the experiment sometime after an anti-war protest rally.  Already you can tell this movie is planning on being about as subtle as the opening credits.Cue to everyone going into the large lecture hall where they are told what the experiment is, a recreation of a prison environment where half the participants will be guards (technically more prisoners than guards, 8-12).  This is where we meet another participant, Forrest Whitaker.  Has this guy ever played a subtle role in his life?  I'm not sure if he has or not, but every scene he's in you can tell he's probably just come from a looney bin, or was born emotionally unstable.  You would think that while conducting their psychological tests and evaluations on each of the participants they would figure out that this guy isn't suited for this experiment, but they decide to let him in anyway.  In the original movie, it seemed like ALL the participants were normal people.  In this movie, it lets you know right off the bat at least 1 of these guys is off their rockers before the test even begins.  First big flaw in the movie logic.And wouldn't ya know it, all the people who seem somewhat emotionally unstable just by looking at them all become the guards.  So within the first 2 days, things start to get a little out of control.  Brody initiates a prison riot when he doesn't want to eat his crappy looking food, and eventually pays for it when the guards drag him from his cell and cuff him half naked to some other place in the open.  Whitaker apparently gets off on this stuff, so you can guess where his character evolves from there.  Soon the guards escalate in their harsh treatment and less fair ways (though to be fair the prisoners occasionally acted like asses too, but in a very mild way compared to how the guards escalate it in the last half of the movie), begin to lose their grip on reality (as do the prisoners), and things start to get out of control.Then comes a twist in the movie where one of Brody's cell mates is revealed to be an ex-prisoner.  Are you s****ing me?  How could the organization running this thing not catch that?  You would think running a background check on these guys would be mandatory.  But nope, he manages to get in on it for the money.  In the original movie, the twist was the cell mate being a member of the air force here undercover to observe all that happens and report when it's all over, which is more believable.  Not so with the American remake.There comes a breaking point where Whitaker whacks a guy on the head with a baton, thereby killing him, and that was when the experiment should have ended.  According to the guy who instructed all of them at the start of the experiment, if any violence is done, the experiment would be over.  Safety is their first concern.  Well, I'd say that would be a good time to let the red light blare and end the whole thing.  But nope, it still continues.  Once Brody gets locked in a cylinder of some sort in a claustrophobic pitch black environment, he notices a camera is in there with him, that the people who organized the experiment anticipated things to escalate this far, thus implying they were willing to let harm come to the participants.  This is where the biggest plot hole comes into the movie.  Just think for a minute.  Can you imagine the repercussions of something like this on the organization?  There would be some serious lawsuits at the very least, damage to the reputation, among other things.  In the original German movie, we saw things from the organization's perspective, to see their logic in escalating things, reasons why they didn't stop things when they should have, reasons that made sense.  In this movie, we don't see another sign of their existence once the experiment starts, just the fact that they're supposed to see everything through the cameras that are all over the complex.In a nutshell, Brody breaks free, lets loose the other prisoners, and big riot begins that results in the guards getting a long waited beat down.  Then the red lights finally turn on, signaling the end of the experiment, resulting in the doors opening and for everyone to realize how foolish they had been ala Lord of the Flies.  You would think there would be a whole squad of cops waiting outside or something for them, but nope, nothing for another hour.  What does come is the same bus that they arrived on to take them away.  What BS.So to summarize, see the original instead.  It's better paced, has better character development, and is more subtle in its themes, letting the viewers learn the themes themselves rather than having it directly told to them.  Speaking of character development, in the original, you not only saw the perspectives from the guards, prisoners, and organization, but also got to know most of the people from all sides very well, which is pretty good for a 2 hour movie, which was my first worry with the remake considering it nearly shaves off 30 minutes of that time.",2,From one who has seen the original.,1304899200,"05 9,

The greatest part of this low budget movie are the actors involved. First is Adrian Brody who will make you believe everything is real and he is a man that stands up for what is right. Second, but never to be understated is Forest Whittiker (hopefully I didn't botch the spelling) who is a heavyweight, fantastic actor who plays a man that was always opressed in life, but now is given the power. The other actors in the cast are dynamite, very believable and do a fantastic job for a movie that is essentially men in a box.Now there are rules to follow for the prison guards... if you don't follow the rules a red light goes on and no one gets their money. There is to be no violence at all. No prisoner may touch a guard. Prisoners must stay in designated areas. Prisoners must eat all food... no matter how nasty it is. So then what happens from there? An oops accidental basketball pass to a guard bangs him in the nose and lays him out. Was that an accident? Does someone need to be punnished? See here's where the talking points come in that you as an audience member can ponder. That is another thing that makes this movie so great. You as a watcher be the judge. It makes you think in good ways while sucking you in.I'm sure you can guess what happens, but what holds this all together is the dynamic of Brody and Forest who both actually start out as aquaintainces that meet before the experiment when they enlist in it. They aren't bffs, but two men that met on the outside are torn apart and rise up to what they were meant to be, which are the two leaders of their groups. If it wasn't for how good the acting is this movie would be nothing special to watch.This is worth everyone's time to watch at least once to ponder what would you do? What is right and what is wrong.

They arrive in a facility and are split into two groups; 6 will act as guards and 20 will act as prisoners in a prison simulation. What we get as the audience is one stunning experiment worth watching.Adrien Brody plays Travis, the leader-like figure for the prisoners, and Forest Whitaker plays Barris, the leader-like figure for the guards. Brody and Whitaker are both spectacular in their roles, and especially liked Whitaker's power hungry roles. The story moves at a very fast pace and focuses on the problems with violence (in life and prison) and emphasizes the change that we can implement as humans; however, it does not preach. It works mostly off of its engaging dialogue and arguements and some violent, disturbing scenes of discipline. The ending was great, as well.Overall, I highly recommend The Experiment; the interesting and engaging story is effectively complimented by brilliant performances from Brody and Whitaker. As of 11/24/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, although I also recommend a purchase.This film has strong violence and blood.

Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker, among a top-grade supporting cast, are two guys who, for their own separate reasons, decide to take a two-week job as either a prisoner or a guard (they don't know which until they get there) at an isolated facility made to resemble a prison where they will be monitored intently by video cameras placed strategically throughout the place. There are some rules that are applied to both prisoner and guard, and these rules only add to the creation of tense and over-the-top situations.Be warned, there are a lot of uncomfortable moments, some blood, and Adrien has to perform a few things as an actor that I would have difficulty doing on or off the camera...as I'm sure almost anyone would.There were a couple of question marks here, like who was making the food and cleaning the eating areas, but other than that, any potential holes in the plot were filled very cleanly and deftly.The mixture of good story, high tension, and great actors make this little surprise of a movie one to put high on your list of flicks to watch in the near future!

There is a reason we use, in our vernacular ""The Angel"" and ""The Devil"" in us. It shows, how, given enough stimulus,our demon self can reign supreme over our concept of self. From a conceptual standpoint, there is nothing new here. As physical animals, our physical preservation is linked with our psychological sense of self and vice versa. So, threat to one triggers conjugal reaction for self-preservation. What is so new about it? The movie has one fatal flaw, and that is about technical aspect of it.(1) The red light was supposed to go on whenever violence takes place. But it seems that the researchers awaited a death and till the end to do so. It does not ""commensurate"" with the premise of the movie, since to the end, the director still wants us to believe it was an experiment, just got a bit extreme.(2) The system set up was such that there was a binding condition to get a certain amount of cash, but the table of power could have been altered easily, since one group outnumbers the other.So, I think the movie was in reality a weak one. But it passes as a yet a decent art work, due to the intense scenes and a sense of optimism.Those who have never accepted the fact that they carry a demon within, the shadow self, are naive; and those who submit to the demon and fail to promote the angel within to march with the demon with necessary solidarity are immature and need grow up further.The concept of the show is unique.

As with mostmovies based on fact, The Experiment closes with a very dramaticfictional finale (perhaps not too far-fetched had the Stanfordtest been allowed to continue).The pacing is steady at 96 minutes, however, they could havetacked on 15 minutes of character development before theirincarceration to help along the latter shock of transformation.The prison setting is dark, unnerving and claustrophobic,helping to give one the sense of being helpless andimprisoned among the actors.

1367196,A1L6V03YBQ8UK0,B003VEL9E8,"Richard Allen ""R. Allen""","[1, 1]","I picked up this movie from a Blockbuster store that was going under for a whole $2 on Blu Ray. Honestly, I didn't even know Adrien Brody was in it, but when I saw that he was, that's when I really gave the movie a try. I loved him in The Pianist and in The Jacket. As the movie got underway, I then saw that Forest Whitaker was in the movie as well. It was then that I felt the movie really had some legs to stand on so I was a little excited.I was let down.The performances by Brody and Whitaker are quite good. Brody plays the role of a peaceful, everyday Joe who answers an ad for a controlled experiment with the promised pay day of $14k. Once there, he meets Whitaker's character who is presented to us as a devout Christian. After some prescreening, both of them, along with several others, are selected to take part in the experiment. Once they arrive at the facility, it is explained to them that they will all be divided into 2 groups: one will be prisoners and the others will be guards. There are a few rules given to the guards as soon as they are getting dressed to start the experiment. Whitaker's character is selected to play a guard while Brody's is to play a prisoner.******SPOILERS AHEAD! STOP READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW SPECIFIC DETAILS!******The concept is laid out cut and dry for us and you can almost immediately tell where this is headed. Still, you find yourself wanting to watch. As the movie progresses though, there is a major plot hole that, in itself, almost does the movie in. A character by the name of Benjy is selected as a prisoner. It is later revealed that Benjy is diabetic. He lies on his application for the project by saying that he controls it with diet when he actually has to take insulin injections. On day two of the experiment, he asks for something to help with his blood sugar levels which are getting low. In most cases, a diabetic with low blood sugar could simply have a decent meal and be just fine. However, instead of simply giving him food, the guards ignore his request and leave him in his weakened state. Being from a family of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, I can assure you if Benjy had not gotten something to eat, he would have been in very serious danger of going into a diabetic coma. From the signs he was displaying, it looked as if he was in dire need of something to eat. Yet, he supposedly goes another full day without eating. He is simply shown laying down in his cell the entire time while the rest of the prisoners go off and have their three meals. Not eating for an entire day can be tough on the average person, but for a diabetic it might as well be a death sentence. Any person with diabetes would have surely succumbed and, at the very least, gone into a coma. Some would have probably died. Later in the film, Benjy ends up getting the insulin he brought with him, but was not allowed to take into the experiment. Having not eaten for an extended period of time, no diabetic would then take insulin as it is used to keep blood sugar levels low. Only if Benjy had been eating should he have taken his insulin. Adrien Brody's character is seen later bringing Benjy a single piece of bread which is not nearly enough for a diabetic to survive on. It is this glaring oversight that, for me, discredits the film as far a believability.Another issue, although smaller, is the set itself. All the participants are supposedly housed in a brick building. During the climax of the film, several prisoners are seen running through a hallway and as they push their hands up against a brick wall, you can actually see the wall wobble. I know you have to suspend disbelief when you watch a film, but the mistakes were so obvious they were hard to ignore.Some of the violence feels very contrived. One of the first disagreements between the guards and the prisoners happens when a prisoner accidentally hits a guard in the face with a basketball. Apologies are given immediately. As a way to punish the prisoner for this, he is asked to do 10 pushups. While the prisoner is a little older, ten pushups seems reasonable and actually very light as far as punishment...yet, he still refuses to do it. From there and through the rest of the movie, the punishments escalate.Brody and Whitaker do turn in very good performances which is why I granted the film the rating that I did. Without their star power and talent, the film is pretty much a throwaway. Clifton Collins, Jr, while not as big a star as Brody and Whitaker, did play the role of a member of the Aryan Brotherhood very well and his performance should also be seen as a bright spot.The rest of the performances felt weak to me. I just couldn't buy some of the others guys in the movie at all. I don't know if it was their performance or if Brody and Whitaker simply outshined them to the point where they came across as first time actors.The transfer to Blu Ray was quite good. The sound quality was there and the picture was clear and crisp on my 48"" HD television. The coloring in certain scenes just shined. I wish more films were transferred as well as this one was.Overall, I can see why the film was a direct to video movie. It really is a shame though. Given the two leads, you'd think they would have had someone fact check more on the writing side. It's not often you get two men who both won Academy Awards into a film together. While some might find the film good, I have to say that it is average at best and the only reason to give it a look is because of the performances turned in by its two stars.2.5 / 5",3,Two Good

1367197,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003VEL9E8,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","The Experiment (Paul T. Scheuring, 2010)As is almost always the case, there is a lot of hooting and hollering on the internet about how The Experiment is yet another crappy American remake of a movie that is much, much better. And in many ways, I tacitly agree with it; Olivier Hirschbiegel's 2001 film Das Experiment got four stars from me and is pretty high up in my Top 1000, while this remake gets two and a half stars. But I feel I kind of need to defend this movie from some of the aggressors, because the arguments I'm seeing...don't make a lot of sense when you compare the two films. But I'm getting ahead of myself.Plot: The Experiment's title makes a good deal more sense to students of recent history when you put the words &#8220;Stanford prison&#8221; in between them. Twenty-six men are chosen from a pool of applicants. They are divided into guards (nine) and prisoners (seventeen) and put into a small, self-contained world meant to resemble a prison...and then the watchers sit back and see how long it takes these people, who were for all intents and purposes equals on the outside, to fall into their roles, with all that conveys. The two groups shake out pretty quickly into their natural orders, with pacifist Travis (Oxygen's Adrian Brody) becoming the de facto leader of the prisoners, and meek office worker Barris (Panic Room's Forest Whitaker) finding himself in the odd position of being the leader of the guards. You know where this is going, but there are other interesting/dramatic/amusing side stories being played out as well.CAUTION: The next paragraph contains spoilers for Hirschbiegel's movie. Be warned.The main argument I keep hearing about how much better the 2001 film is in comparison to this one is that it's closer to what really happened. I'm sorry, folks, but that's sheer, unadulterated bull[censored for Amazon consumption]. Do you really think that daring escape in the climax of the 2001 movie happened that way? (Christina Maslach, upon whom Franka Potente's character was based, did object to the experiment, and it was her intervention that got the experiment shut down, but she did not help bust the prisoners out.) &#8220;Based on a true story&#8221; means exactly that, and the folks who are writing the screenplays are going to change details for dramatic tension. And, given that a decade elapsed between the two films and that they were made in two different cultures, the details the scriptwriters change are going to be different. The particular hidden side we end up seeing to Chase (Easy A's Cam Gigandet) was added because that's a part of the American public consciousness/primal fear; the screenwriters in Germany might not have even had it cross their minds, because it's not the huge bugaboo in Europe that it is an America. If you're going to complain about a movie for working strains of tension inherent to its culture, that's not a problem with the movie.That said, where the movie went was kind of predictable, and in ways I wish it hadn't been. It makes sense in the scope of the film for Scheuring's screenplay to have most of the prisoners be shallow stereotypes, but that doesn't make them any more satisfying (and it also tips his hand as to one character who becomes an unwitting catalyst to the events in the final quarter of the film; it's an ambitious play, but because of the way Scheuring structured his characters, it doesn't have the impact it could have). And, well, the climax, which has taken so much heat...it's obviously drawing from Hirschbiegel rather than actual events, but where Hirschbiegel threw in a curve ball or two (the major one is alluded to above), Scheuring went with the most logical probable outcome, after throwing in one character revelation that made not one damn bit of sense (nor of difference, when it came right down to it), and robbed much of what should have been a fist-pumping satisfactory climax of its rah-rah-rah-ness. (That said, he does set up the denouement, which is quite the depressing anticlimax, and in many ways it's the most effective part of the movie.)I wanted this to be a better movie than it is. But with that said, I rather liked it; any chance Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker get to flex their onscreen muscles is probably going to be worth at least a watch, and neither disappoints here.

An experiment in the human psyche is conducted using a prison setting where one third of the participants are guards and two thirds are inmates. They are divided up according to their interview, part of which we get to see as a way to quickly build character. Adrien Brody is a prisoner. He is the ultra liberal atheists. Forrest Whitaker, a religious fellow who believes in absolute right and wrong becomes one of the guards. The two briefly talk and connect prior to the interview process.The participants are promised a $1,000 dollars a day as long as they follow the rules. Breaking the rules must be dealt with ""commensurately"" and within 30 minutes or else the red light comes on, the experiment is over and no one gets paid. At this point I suspected two things: 1) The red light would never come on no matter what they did and 2)There were some shills within the group. I was wrong about the second one.While one of the rules was ""no violence"" the guards gradually test what constitutes violence. The red light becomes their ""God"" who ""approves"" of their action by inactivity. Forrest Whitaker eventually becomes the leader of the guards, even punishing his own guards who have compassion toward the prisoners. Adrien Brody becomes his rival as the leader of the prisoners.The acting is good. The action is at a good pace.

The guard would not let the guy have anything to bring his sugar up. He should know that could result in a coma and potential death.

The experiment begins and soon confrontations arise, with some of the ""guards"" who take their roles very seriously.This is supposed to be a psychological thriller, but not many actions of the characters are really convincing.

Acting of the leads is just OK, though overacting Forest Whitaker repeating ""Toilet!"" with grimace is unintentionally funny.

As you know, the original German version directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel is inspired by Stanford Prison Experiment, which I believe did not end in this way.Interestingly, for the remake Paul Scheuring has added a new idea to the original storyline: ""a red lamp"" that shows the termination of the experiment. I see the point the filmmakers are trying to make (obedience to the authorities, abuse of power, etc.), but the presence (or absence) of the red light in the film only lessens the credibility of the story, making the whole situation unbelievable.With 'guilty pleasure' written all over it, ""The Experience"" is yet another unnecessary remake.
