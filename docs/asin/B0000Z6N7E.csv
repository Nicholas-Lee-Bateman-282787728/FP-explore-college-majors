789942,A3MFF3HWX2TB60,B0000Z6N7E,DR-J-J,"[5, 5]","First of all, let me address the person concerned for the dogs.  The reviewer said that the father says to ""beat the dogs"" to the son.  That isn't quite accurate.  The father tells the son to ""whip the dog"" referring to giving one disobedient sled dog a correction.  Is that a big difference?  Two things. First, these are sled dogs being trained for racing, not dogs who are pets who just tipped over a vase.  Second, this was in reference to one dog.  The father, in fact, will not sell his dogs to the antagonist in the story because he uses a whip on his dog to motivate them to run faster. The father wants nothing to do with beating dogs to make them run faster. Rather, the scene in question is regarding one dog that will not work like the others.  The line may still be offensive to some, but it does carry a different tone in the entirety of the show.The emphasis in the show is being good to the animals, always caring for them, feeding them before the master gets fed, loving the animals.  True, the line still may be too much if you think that the idea of a sled dog being trained to run is offensive.  And I  understand that. It bothered me a bit, even with the context.  But in context (the son (about 18 years) cries with the thought of correcting this dog in this wa)y... and that is part of the point of growing up for the son.  And that correcting laziness and disobedience, curbing our own desires for the good of others (and the like), are important steps to manhood.  You may still disagree, but there is some context for it.This show is dated.  Most may stumble across this movie because of the popularity of the lead actor (Toby) who is also in the somewhat popular Murdoch Mysteries (6 season thus far). It looks like a made for TV movie of the 80's complete with Avacado (or is it Harvest Gold) appliances, panelled dens, Ski Doos, and 80's attire... and all shot with a video camera, not film.  Some of the acceptable movie subjects of the era show up in the lines.  There is a focus on individuals ""finding themselves"" and romantic connects.... all with the younger brother going ""ewwww!"" with every kiss and romantic interlude. One teen girl hopes the ""new teacher"" being flown in will ""crash"" so as not to have a teacher.  That is a worse line that the one about the dog, in my opinion.  It was meant to be funny, it isn't.  The other problem with kid friendliness is that the romantic connection between Toby and the ""city girlfriend"" is the focal point of the romance in the show (true the father connects with the school teacher, but the kids have more touching, fondling, and the like than the father and teacher.It may also be off-putting that the teen (who is playing a good teen who makes a few bad choices) continues to make incredibly bad choices even later in the show when everyone around him warns him sternly that he is doing wrong. Yes, he suffers for this misdeed, including his father, but then saves an Native American as well as his father, and the bad decision gets lost in the story line. In general (and probably true of 80's made for TV fare) there is very little focus on making wise decisions...it is mostly self-discovery.  Even the father (who is going to lose the family farm) has no plans to keep things financially stable after he wins $6,000 for the race.  But perhaps I am being too picky now for the time of the movie.I give it 4 stars instead of three because I took into account the era it was being made.  It is enjoyable and keeps you guessing about what will happen next.  It is a good movie about a boy growing up, learning to be responsible, and the hard work that it takes to get there. Yes, I wish the father would direct the son a bit better in the process...for instance, not let his 18 year old son have his girlfriend on his bed. But I may be asking too much of Hollywood in the 80's to be this considerate.  After all, even the Partridge family had scenes like this one. Still, if you love dogs and races and growing up to be responsible and family overcoming the odds, this is a great example of that set in the 80's in Canada.",4,"Good movie, not entirely kid appropriate, and definitely dated",1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,4104,"['First', 'let', 'address', 'person', 'concerned', 'dogs', 'reviewer', 'said', 'father', 'beat', 'dogs', 'son', ""n't"", 'quite', 'accurate', 'father', 'son', 'whip', 'dog', 'referring', 'giving', 'one', 'disobedient', 'sled', 'dog', 'correction', 'big', 'difference', 'Two', 'things', 'First', 'are', 'sled', 'dogs', 'being', 'trained', 'racing', 'not', 'dogs', 'who', 'are', 'pets', 'who', 'just', 'tipped', 'over', 'vase', 'Second', 'was', 'reference', 'one', 'dog', 'father', 'fact', 'will', 'not', 'sell', 'dogs', 'antagonist', 'story', 'whip', 'dog', 'motivate', 'run', 'faster', 'father', 'nothing', 'do', 'beating', 'dogs', 'make', 'run', 'faster', 'Rather', 'scene', 'question', 'regarding', 'one', 'dog', 'will', 'not', 'work', 'others', 'line', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'offensive', 'carry', 'different', 'tone', 'entirety', 'show.The', 'emphasis', 'show', 'being', 'good', 'animals', 'always', 'caring', 'feeding', 'master', 'fed', 'loving', 'animals', 'True', 'line', 'still', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'think', 'idea', 'sled', 'dog', 'being', 'trained', 'run', 'offensive', 'understand', 'bothered', 'bit', 'even', 'context', 'context', 'son', '18', 'years', 'cries', 'thought', 'correcting', 'dog', 'wa', 'y', 'part', 'point', 'growing', 'up', 'son', 'correcting', 'laziness', 'disobedience', 'curbing', 'own', 'desires', 'good', 'others', 'like', 'are', 'important', 'steps', 'manhood', 'may', 'still', 'disagree', 'context', 'it.This', 'show', 'dated', 'Most', 'may', 'stumble', 'movie', 'popularity', 'lead', 'actor', 'Toby', 'who', 'also', 'somewhat', 'popular', 'Murdoch', 'Mysteries', '6', 'season', 'thus', 'far', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', '80', 'complete', 'Avacado', 'Harvest', 'Gold', 'appliances', 'panelled', 'dens', 'Ski', 'Doos', '80', 'attire', 'shot', 'video', 'camera', 'not', 'film', 'acceptable', 'movie', 'subjects', 'era', 'show', 'up', 'lines', 'focus', 'individuals', 'finding', 'romantic', 'connects', 'younger', 'brother', 'going', 'ewwww', 'kiss', 'romantic', 'interlude', 'One', 'teen', 'girl', 'new', 'teacher', 'being', 'flown', 'will', 'crash', 'so', 'not', 'have', 'teacher', 'worse', 'line', 'one', 'dog', 'opinion', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'funny', ""n't"", 'other', 'problem', 'kid', 'friendliness', 'romantic', 'connection', 'Toby', 'city', 'girlfriend', 'focal', 'point', 'romance', 'show', 'true', 'father', 'school', 'teacher', 'kids', 'have', 'more', 'touching', 'fondling', 'like', 'father', 'teacher.It', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'off-putting', 'teen', 'who', 'playing', 'good', 'teen', 'who', 'few', 'bad', 'choices', 'make', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'choices', 'even', 'later', 'show', 'when', 'everyone', 'sternly', 'doing', 'wrong', 'Yes', 'misdeed', 'including', 'father', 'then', 'Native', 'American', 'as', 'well', 'father', 'bad', 'decision', 'lost', 'story', 'line', 'general', 'probably', 'true', '80', 'made', 'TV', 'fare', 'very', 'little', 'focus', 'making', 'wise', 'decisions', 'mostly', 'self-discovery', 'Even', 'father', 'who', 'going', 'lose', 'family', 'farm', 'plans', 'keep', 'things', 'financially', 'stable', '6,000', 'race', 'perhaps', 'am', 'being', 'too', 'picky', 'now', 'time', 'movie.I', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'instead', 'three', 'took', 'account', 'era', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'enjoyable', 'guessing', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'good', 'movie', 'boy', 'growing', 'up', 'learning', 'be', 'responsible', 'hard', 'work', 'get', 'there', 'Yes', 'wish', 'father', 'would', 'direct', 'son', 'bit', 'better', 'process', 'instance', 'not', 'let', '18', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'have', 'girlfriend', 'bed', 'may', 'be', 'asking', 'too', 'much', 'Hollywood', '80', 'be', 'considerate', 'even', 'Partridge', 'family', 'had', 'scenes', 'one', 'Still', 'love', 'dogs', 'races', 'growing', 'up', 'be', 'responsible', 'family', 'overcoming', 'odds', 'great', 'example', 'set', '80', 'Canada']",Toby McTeague
