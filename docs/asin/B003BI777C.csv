1335567,A3A48KP40IXF2R,B003BI777C,Darthcasey,"[1, 1]","It's inevitable to compare Live From Tokyo and Live From Shanghai to the first live release, Live From Paris. Anyone that owns or has seen all three will do this. But doing so gives Tokyo and Shanghai undeserved negative feedback. First of all, Live From Paris was thirty minutes longer than either Tokyo or Shanghai. Fans complained about Tokyo that Rachel Brice and Ansuya were absent; well, now Jillian and Sharon Kihara are also absent. Bad news? Sure, if they're the only reason you wanted to watch the show. If, however, you're like I am and notice that Live From Shanghai has the same format as the other two with equally qualified dancers, you'll have no problem enjoying it. For example, on all three DVD's Sonia has the second performance called The Art of the Drum Solo. On Live From Paris, Sonia made it evident why she was allowed the first drum solo improv, although I found her Tokyo performance lackluster-perhaps because I compared it, again, to the one on the Paris DVD. On Live From Shanghai, however, I thought she eclipsed even her Paris performance. She also has a great duet with Moria Chappell. Speaking of Moria Chappell, she could hold her own with any past or present Superstar-or any bellydancer in the world for that matter. As could returning tribal dancer Samantha, who gets her own solo dance (akin to Rachel Brice in Paris and Sharon Kihara in Tokyo), which ranks in the top three of her best dances. She was trained by Rachel Brice and, therefore, her style is similar. Welcome also Sabrina Fox, the newest BDSS. Overall, Live From Paris is the best and it sucks the aforementioned dancers are gone, but so what? Live From Shanghai deserves no negativity.",5,Another Flawless Live Performance,1281830400,"08 15, 2010",2010,1689,"['inevitable', 'compare', 'Live', 'From', 'Tokyo', 'Live', 'From', 'Shanghai', 'first', 'live', 'release', 'Live', 'Paris', 'Anyone', 'seen', 'three', 'will', 'do', 'doing', 'so', 'Tokyo', 'Shanghai', 'undeserved', 'negative', 'feedback', 'First', 'Live', 'Paris', 'was', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'longer', 'Tokyo', 'Shanghai', 'Fans', 'complained', 'Tokyo', 'Rachel', 'Brice', 'Ansuya', 'were', 'absent', 'well', 'now', 'Jillian', 'Sharon', 'Kihara', 'are', 'also', 'absent', 'Bad', 'news', 'Sure', ""'re"", 'only', 'reason', 'wanted', 'watch', 'show', 'however', ""'re"", 'am', 'notice', 'Live', 'Shanghai', 'same', 'format', 'other', 'two', 'equally', 'qualified', 'dancers', ""'ll"", 'have', 'problem', 'enjoying', 'example', 'three', 'DVD', 'Sonia', 'second', 'performance', 'called', 'Art', 'Drum', 'Solo', 'Live', 'From', 'Paris', 'Sonia', 'made', 'evident', 'why', 'was', 'allowed', 'first', 'drum', 'solo', 'improv', 'found', 'Tokyo', 'performance', 'lackluster-perhaps', 'compared', 'again', 'one', 'Paris', 'DVD', 'Live', 'From', 'Shanghai', 'however', 'thought', 'eclipsed', 'even', 'Paris', 'performance', 'also', 'great', 'duet', 'Moria', 'Chappell', 'Speaking', 'Moria', 'Chappell', 'could', 'hold', 'own', 'past', 'present', 'Superstar-or', 'bellydancer', 'world', 'matter', 'could', 'returning', 'tribal', 'dancer', 'Samantha', 'who', 'own', 'solo', 'dance', 'akin', 'Rachel', 'Brice', 'Paris', 'Sharon', 'Kihara', 'Tokyo', 'top', 'three', 'best', 'dances', 'was', 'trained', 'Rachel', 'Brice', 'therefore', 'style', 'similar', 'Welcome', 'also', 'Sabrina', 'Fox', 'newest', 'BDSS', 'Overall', 'Live', 'From', 'Paris', 'best', 'aforementioned', 'dancers', 'are', 'gone', 'so', 'what', 'Live', 'Shanghai', 'negativity']",Art of Bellydance: Live From Shanghai

Accompanying by master percussionist Issam Houshan, the bellydancers put on a show like no other. My personal favourites was the Ballet D'Orient and the South Pacific Bellynesian segments of the DVD. Sonia, Sabah, Colleen and the rest of the bellydancers spared no effort in entertaining the audience in this installment of the BDSS collection. I enjoy this DVD as much I enjoyed the other BDSS editions.

1335569,A1SPAHK3KEKNVP,B003BI777C,"Le Monde ""Le Monde""","[6, 6]","I was hesitant about watching this dvd, because I have not been enthused with the instructional dvd's that BDSS has produced.The beginning performance was extremely boring. There was nothing with this piece that set the BDSS apart from any other dance company. A lot of twirls and whirls, but no real depth to the movement and again boring choreography.The Second performance brought out Issam (Amazing drummer).Who came and interacted with the crowd, then did a piece with Sonia. If you watch his doumbek closely it lights up. Super cute.There were some parts of her performance I liked some I didn't but overall this piece was decent. She played zils :).It looked as if some of her performance was choreograph and some was improvisational,on some parts she was just off.The third performance was tribal.The dancer with the black hair and red flower's dancing looked off.It looked as if they put the best dancers in the front. Overall the performance was okay.The Fourth performance- Beirut Nights.Absolutely boringWheel within a wheel Fifth performance- Love this performance, very creative. The veil work and spinning was excellent.I could not imagine turning for a whole song.Bravo.Sixth performance-New Delhi Dank,It was okay.Fusionista-Simply a weird performance, and not good at all.Odissi Fusion-I love the concept, but the execution was not a hit. There were some extremely cool things in this performance.But their energy level was low and they did not make the routine pop, .Party Drum 2010-brung Issam back out,interacting with the audience again.The drum solo all around sucked outrageously. I mean some of the women honestly looked like the were amateur dancers.Sabrina was pretty decent.Beirut Nights part two-BoringBallet D'orient-Again I liked the concept, but the execution was off.Ya Raitone-Cute routine but boring to watch.The Dude-Excellent performance, you could really see the technique. This was very energetique and engaging.South Pacific BELLYNESIAN-I am a bit disappointed, I thought this performance was going to be exceptional. Not exceptional but good.Tribal solo with Issam again-BoringCairo Nights-boringWayward Farwell-boringWe are one, This secion has a couple of performances.Colorful and unoriginal.I enjoyed the poi performance.The endTo be honest it was hard for me to even keep watching this dvd. I don't want to seem like I am bashing the dancers because I don't want to discredit the hardwork they must without a doubt put into these shows. But this dvd simply put was not good. There was no creativity, no energy, the moves they used were repititious.(smh).There was very little variety among the dancers: I felt like I was watching the same person perform over and over again.There was no emotional depth of interpretation of the music. Some of the stuff looked like it was anything but bellydance.I was bored with pretty much the whole dvd.They incorporated a lot of cultural things. You saw some Indian,some hip hop, some latin,some polynesian a little bit of everything, but I do not think they did justice to the different cultural aspects.",2,Uhmn.....,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,3088,"['was', 'hesitant', 'watching', 'dvd', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'enthused', 'instructional', 'dvd', 'BDSS', 'produced.The', 'beginning', 'performance', 'was', 'extremely', 'boring', 'was', 'nothing', 'piece', 'set', 'BDSS', 'apart', 'other', 'dance', 'company', 'lot', 'twirls', 'whirls', 'real', 'depth', 'movement', 'again', 'boring', 'choreography.The', 'Second', 'performance', 'brought', 'out', 'Issam', 'Amazing', 'drummer', '.Who', 'came', 'interacted', 'crowd', 'then', 'did', 'piece', 'Sonia', 'watch', 'doumbek', 'closely', 'up', 'Super', 'were', 'parts', 'performance', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'overall', 'piece', 'was', 'decent', 'played', 'zils', '.It', 'looked', 'performance', 'was', 'choreograph', 'was', 'improvisational', 'parts', 'was', 'just', 'off.The', 'third', 'performance', 'was', 'tribal.The', 'dancer', 'black', 'hair', 'red', 'flower', 'dancing', 'looked', 'off.It', 'looked', 'put', 'best', 'dancers', 'front', 'performance', 'was', 'okay.The', 'Fourth', 'performance-', 'Beirut', 'Nights.Absolutely', 'boringWheel', 'wheel', 'Fifth', 'performance-', 'Love', 'performance', 'very', 'creative', 'veil', 'work', 'spinning', 'was', 'excellent.I', 'could', 'not', 'imagine', 'turning', 'whole', 'song.Bravo.Sixth', 'performance-New', 'Delhi', 'Dank', 'was', 'okay.Fusionista-Simply', 'weird', 'performance', 'not', 'good', 'all.Odissi', 'Fusion-I', 'concept', 'execution', 'was', 'not', 'hit', 'were', 'extremely', 'cool', 'things', 'performance.But', 'energy', 'level', 'was', 'low', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'routine', 'pop', '.Party', 'Drum', '2010-brung', 'Issam', 'back', 'out', 'interacting', 'audience', 'again.The', 'drum', 'solo', 'sucked', 'outrageously', 'mean', 'women', 'honestly', 'looked', 'were', 'amateur', 'dancers.Sabrina', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent.Beirut', 'Nights', 'part', 'two-BoringBallet', ""D'orient-Again"", 'liked', 'concept', 'execution', 'was', 'off.Ya', 'Raitone-Cute', 'routine', 'boring', 'watch.The', 'Dude-Excellent', 'performance', 'could', 'really', 'see', 'technique', 'was', 'very', 'energetique', 'engaging.South', 'Pacific', 'BELLYNESIAN-I', 'am', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'thought', 'performance', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'exceptional', 'Not', 'exceptional', 'good.Tribal', 'solo', 'Issam', 'again-BoringCairo', 'Nights-boringWayward', 'Farwell-boringWe', 'are', 'one', 'secion', 'couple', 'performances.Colorful', 'unoriginal.I', 'enjoyed', 'poi', 'performance.The', 'endTo', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'hard', 'even', 'keep', 'watching', 'dvd', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'seem', 'am', 'bashing', 'dancers', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'discredit', 'hardwork', 'must', 'doubt', 'put', 'shows', 'dvd', 'simply', 'put', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'was', 'creativity', 'energy', 'moves', 'used', 'were', 'repititious', 'smh', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'variety', 'dancers', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'same', 'person', 'perform', 'again.There', 'was', 'emotional', 'depth', 'interpretation', 'music', 'stuff', 'looked', 'was', 'anything', 'bellydance.I', 'was', 'bored', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'dvd.They', 'incorporated', 'lot', 'cultural', 'things', 'saw', 'Indian', 'hip', 'hop', 'latin', 'polynesian', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'did', 'justice', 'different', 'cultural', 'aspects']",Art of Bellydance: Live From Shanghai

I expected to prefer the traditional Egyptian and AmCab performances, however, I think the tribal numbers were the highlight. The presence of Issam Houshan was delightful, as always.Three performances did fall flat for me. The polynesian number was unexciting, slow and static, completely lacking the dynamic energy that should have infused it. The bellydance-ballet number suffered from awkward moments, or, possible missteps, I honestly couldn't say after one viewing. Then there was ""Ya Raitone."" Think Bellydance meets Reggaeton. I don't consider myself a purist, but this didn't work on any level for me and I'm disappointed it made it into the show. It felt like a rookie error, something that should have been revamped or removed during ""previews.""Those three numbers aside, overall I liked the show. However, the editing and cinematography had an ""amateur-hour"" feel. Almost every wide-shot has a moving jib (camera) on the right side, in some cases obscuring a dancer. It's distracting and annoying AND ironic considering there is precious little footage from that camera included in the final cut. Also, let me not forget the wide-shot with the late-arriving audience member moving across the lower 1/3 of the screen. Talk about quality! That mess aside, there was the dubious decision to sometimes cut away from the dancers during the performance to show a poorly-lit audience, with easily visible empty seats, and less than thrilled attendees. I don't know if the director or the editor is to blame, but someone should hang their head in shame.Bad editing aside,Art of Bellydance: Live From Shanghaimakes for a decent entry into the BDSS universe.

1335572,A2Q543TN0328O1,B003BI777C,"Ramona ""Author of Dynamic Belly Dance""","[0, 0]","The photography on this DVD is first-rate, including close-ups of the dancers so that you see the details of their movements and costuming. All the dances are beautiful, but I especially enjoyed the opening number, in which some of the dancers were using Isis wings. I particularly like Isis wings and thought this group dance was very well-choreographed. Another highlight was when some of the dancers who are usually in the background were featured in short solos with drummer Issam. I thought it was so nice to give these talented dancers a chance for us to see them as soloists, since they are usually dancing in a group choreography.Petite Jamilla is one of my all-time favorite soloists, and she's featured in a multiple-veil dance. I'm so impressed with Petite Jamilla's beautiful spinning, and at the very end of the show she accompanies Issam by playing bagpipes. Sonia is always dressed in beautiful costumes, and the details showed up well on this DVD. She led a group Polynesian fusion dance as well as being featured in solos. The tribal dancers had new and beautiful costumes, and were featured several times in the show. We miss Rachel, but these dancers do a beautiful presentation of tribal fusion.The Shanghai stage has oriental lanterns hanging from the ceiling, they are lovely and add to the setting, and I'm assuming that they were part of the theater in Shanghai, since we didn't see them when we attended the live show when the Superstars were in Atlanta. If you attended one of the ""Art of Bellydance"" Superstars shows while they were on tour, you may notice that this recording is different from what you saw. We noticed that a folkloric group line dance that we saw in Atlanta was not included in the Shanghai show. I think they made good choices about re-organizing and editing the show. The music is very good and the sound quality as well as the photography are excellent. I'm recommending this DVD to my cabaret and tribal fusion dance students.",5,"Beautiful photography, lovely opening number",1278460800,"07 7, 2010",2010,1976,"['photography', 'DVD', 'first-rate', 'including', 'close-ups', 'dancers', 'see', 'details', 'movements', 'costuming', 'dances', 'are', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'opening', 'number', 'dancers', 'were', 'using', 'Isis', 'wings', 'particularly', 'Isis', 'wings', 'thought', 'group', 'dance', 'was', 'very', 'well-choreographed', 'highlight', 'was', 'when', 'dancers', 'who', 'are', 'usually', 'background', 'were', 'featured', 'short', 'solos', 'drummer', 'Issam', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'nice', 'give', 'talented', 'dancers', 'chance', 'see', 'soloists', 'are', 'usually', 'dancing', 'group', 'choreography.Petite', 'Jamilla', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'soloists', 'featured', 'multiple-veil', 'dance', ""'m"", 'so', 'impressed', 'Petite', 'Jamilla', 'beautiful', 'spinning', 'very', 'end', 'show', 'Issam', 'playing', 'bagpipes', 'Sonia', 'always', 'dressed', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'details', 'showed', 'up', 'well', 'DVD', 'led', 'group', 'Polynesian', 'fusion', 'dance', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'featured', 'solos', 'tribal', 'dancers', 'had', 'new', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'were', 'featured', 'several', 'times', 'show', 'miss', 'Rachel', 'dancers', 'do', 'beautiful', 'presentation', 'tribal', 'fusion.The', 'Shanghai', 'stage', 'oriental', 'lanterns', 'hanging', 'ceiling', 'are', 'lovely', 'add', 'setting', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'were', 'part', 'theater', 'Shanghai', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'when', 'attended', 'live', 'show', 'when', 'Superstars', 'were', 'Atlanta', 'attended', 'one', 'Art', 'Bellydance', 'Superstars', 'shows', 'were', 'tour', 'may', 'notice', 'recording', 'different', 'what', 'saw', 'noticed', 'folkloric', 'group', 'line', 'dance', 'saw', 'Atlanta', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'Shanghai', 'show', 'think', 'made', 'good', 'choices', 're-organizing', 'editing', 'show', 'music', 'very', 'good', 'sound', 'quality', 'as', 'well', 'photography', 'are', 'excellent', ""'m"", 'recommending', 'DVD', 'cabaret', 'tribal', 'fusion', 'dance', 'students']",Art of Bellydance: Live From Shanghai
