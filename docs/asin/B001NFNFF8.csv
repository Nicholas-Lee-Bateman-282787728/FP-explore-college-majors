I have become a big Tommy Lee Jones fan over the past few years, and I enjoyed his acting in this murder mystery/ghost whatever it was.... I thought John Goodman was a little on the sloppy side with his portrayal of ""Baby Feet Balboni"" (hilarious mob boss name, btw), Peter Sarsgaard was kind of funny and did an OK job. I was confused by his role in the movie. I mean, I know he helped to move the plot along alot, but he was drunk more than half the time, which was so annoying, and I couldn't understand what he was saying sometimes. Mary Steenburgen was a nice surprise. I think she's a wonderful presence in any film. The rest of the cast was only so-so with their acting, definitely not up to par with Mr. Jones.The story was entertaining despite being confusing, and maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had read the actual book first.

While reading Tin Roof Blowdown, I mentally cast the book as a film.  I said to myself, ""Only Tommy Lee Jones can play this man.""  And, lo and behold, there he is in In The Electric Mist! I never heard of it (it came out in 2008)but found it on Netflix. The film is very interesting with twists and turns throughout. The locale photography is just beautiful. Even the bayou with the twisted trees, black waters and Spanish Moss comes out as lovely as a Vogue photograph.I met John Goodman in '83 when he was an unknown actor here in NYC slowly making a name for himself. He lived around the corner from me in a walk up that was anything but House Beautiful. I told him backstage (my daughter was in the play after his) that he and J.T. Walsh (also in his play) were going to make it big some day. They had enormous talent.  Once they moved out to LA they did hit it big. John was quite slim back in '83, believe it or not, and totally adorable. He had a bartender friend durning that time in '83 named Bruce who also went to LA. Never met him but his last name was Willis.  Wonder what became of him?! Just kidding. John lives in Louisiana now and while I didn't like his character in the film, I enjoyed seeing him chew the scenery like old times.I wish they would film the entire series of James Lee Burke's books with Tommy Lee Jones and use John in a nicer, bigger role next time. I really loved seeing the Louisiana scenery in every frame. I also wonder how long we will be able to see her in her pristine glory before another Katrina wipes her off the face of the map.  And, sadly, that day will come.  Hopefully not in my lifetime.  Buy the movie for the wonderful actors, but especially for Miss Louisiana.

Dave is a man of honor who lives by his own code giving fits to his superiors and absolute grief to the hucksters, thieves, murderers and criminals he has no compunction about hunting down and kicking the living daylights of or dispatching to eternity when appropriate.As to the movie, it is well done by an old master, Travenier, but I probably enjoyed it more than some would, having read all of Burke's Robicheaux books and therefore fully versed on all the backstories of the supporting characters.  Native of New Orleans, John Goodman fits in here perfectly, and the rest of the cast is fine.  The only character missing in this story is Dave's partner Clete, who is even more prone to unexpected violence and trouble-making than Dave.At any rate, as a fan of the books and the characters and having followed the arcs of their lives I thoroughly enjoyed seeing them fleshed out in film.

In all honesty, this was almost exactly how I'd pictured it from reading the books.But a caveat: if you haven't read the books, you're probably not going to enjoy this movie, which is probably why in the USA it was released directly to DVD. Burke's novels are very introspective, which makes for interesting literature, but slow movies. There's plenty of drama, with several murders, corruption, and depravity to spare.

Second, remains of someone killed 40 years ago are found and Robicheaux believes they are of a black man he actually witnessed being shot when he was a teenager.His main suspect in the hooker murders is a mobster played by John Goodman which leads him to another man. Robicheaux knows he must be getting closer to the truth when a bullet meant for him kills a young actress his family has befriended and then someone tries to frame him for another killing.

The cast would be headlined by Tommy Lee Jones including Kelly Macdonald, Peter Sarrsgard and John Goodman and was filmed in the real New Iberia Lousiana. What could go wrong with having a world famous director and a cast like that make a movie? Apparently everything as I never heard of a release date for the movie until it was shat out straight to DVD yesterday. Now I know that pedigree isn't enough to mainline at least a countrywide release but I thought why not an independent release instead. Was the final film that bad that it couldn't have at least a better release. Well to tell the truth its not bad but...Well for one big problem is the lack of any real suspense in the whole movie thats billed as a thriller. They have twists and turns but there wasn't anything that generated interest. I mean sure they incorporate Katrina into the picture, and the actors are decent at what they do. Theres too many plot points that don't wrap up easy and have a hard time fitting together in the first place. I've heard complaints that the movie seemed tailored to readers of the novel but really when theres nothing there thats a bigger problem. I suppose you could say that the whole thing doesn't even really take time developing the characters in interesting ways as well. The actors do what they can but the only one who seemed interesting at least was Kelly Macdonald who was only in a few scenes and was taken out of the picture incredibly too early in a scene too telegraphed. Tavernier sadly also seems to be a problem. I've only seen one other film the straight adapation of Jim Thompson's Pop. 1280 (Corp De Touchon) but He seems more lockstep shooting the script and hoping the actors are good enough to make something of it. There the actors and script were good. Here the actors are good but the script isn't and the film falters.Which is a shame really because the film does occupy its setting like Burkes books do. Theres a lot more local talent on display then actors and the setting of the movie was a beautiful location. Just the movie outside of the scenes where Jones confers with Hood hallucination was what worked. Other than that I found the movie decidedly average. Okay just reading DVDBeaver where apparently there are two cuts of the film, a producers cut which We have here and a better directors cut.The DVD is a sad affair too. The picture on my set suffered from some pixelation despite having good color and a generally sharp picture though the sound was good.

Forty years later he's going to find out who did it and why.Bertrand Tavernier, the director, is going to take us on a journey into bayou Louisiana centered around New Iberia parish where the conditions of life haven't changed much for a lot of people. Along the way we're going to meet all kinds of characters, and this is one of the movie's strengths. Dave may have a good marriage to a strong woman (Mary Steenburgen), but there's also that childhood friend who now is the sociopath Julie ""Baby Feet' Balboni (played with great, vicious style by John Goodman). Feets is back in New Iberia because he's backing a movie being filmed nearby. There are aging good ol' boys and blacks who respect Dave but know when to be cautious. There's his daughter Alafair and even a couple of movie stars, Elrod Sykes (Peter Sarsgard) and Kelly Drummond (Kelly Macdonald). There are bayous thick with mosquitoes and trees heavy with moss. The dialogue is pungent and sounds natural. There's even Confederate General John Bell Hood who Dave finds himself talking to now and then. For most of the time, In the Electric Mist is a moody, sometimes vivid, occasionally violent story that has more to do with characters and relationships than murders.This is Tommy Lee Jones' movie. He's in almost every scene. He provides the occasional narrative. His introspective discussions with Hood give us insights to his conflicts (which some of us may or not feel adds to the story). With all the good things about the movie, though, there are three significant weaknesses. First, Jones is too old for the part. He can play tired, seen-it-all types better than most, but he's noticeably older than almost everyone else in the movie. Second, I'm one of those who could easily do without, in the movie as well as in the book, the Confederate specters providing an excuse for Dave's angst and Hood as an excuse for insights into Dave's soul. For me, this is a just a literary device that comes off as unneeded and awkward. Third, the movie attempts to bring the conclusion together too quickly. The knots get tied, but we have no time to satisfactorily understand a couple of the story threads or to savor the conclusion of a movie whose style and characters gave so much pleasure.Well, we can't always get everything we want. What we do get is darn good. The background to the movie, however, might scare us off. Evidently Tavernier and Jones did not see eye to eye as the movie was being filmed. The American producer took Tavernier's cut, chopped off 15 minutes and released the movie direct to DVD in the United States. The movie was released to theaters worldwide elsewhere with Tavernier's 117 minute cut. I've heard one or two critics say that the U.S. DVD release is hard to follow. No it isn't. There is only one part of the story where some useful motivation was evidently hacked up. I'd certainly like to see Tavernier's version. Just stay alert and you'll have few problems.Bernard Tavernier is one of the best directors around. To get a glimpse of his style and variety, tryCoup du Torchon(1981), a supremely mordant and cynical black comedy;D'Artagnan's Daughter(1994), a flashy costume adventure; andLife and Nothing But(1989), a sad and thoughtful film. Tavernier often used Philippe Noiret in his films; it was a great partnership.We'll let Dave have the last word after he's solved the crimes and confronted one of perpetrators. ""Have you no mercy, sir?"" asks the aging man.""No, sir,"" Dave says. ""No, sir, I don't.""",4,Bertrand Tavernier does just fine with Dave Robicheaux.

Park,"[1, 1]","I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this film- I can often take or leave Tommy Lee Jones, as he so often plays the gruff-yet-philosophical-Southerner type and could almost be accused of the Robin WIlliams syndrome- too many of the same sort of roles (tho Robin has busted right out of that prison with a handful of well-done psycho roles). But I remembered why I essentially enjoy him as an actor, because nobody can do the gruff-yet-philosophical number as well as he.First off, as a Southerner, I was very happy to see some intelligence accorded to the natives. Yeah, there are your usual white trash folk here, but that is a reality- prodigious use of the ""n"" word, lots of beer drinking and fishing, etc- and to pretend that doesn't exist would be false. But I very much enjoyed both Jones' lyrical way of talking as well as Levon Helm's Civil War general- and I won't say much beyond that lest i give it away. Naturally this is based on a novel so I can only say that the screen adaption has made me mightily curious to read the book, as it has a lot of depth and a surprising amount of heart.The one flaw the film had was the perplexing use of people who couldn't act in supporting roles. Some of the local types seemed like they were reading off cue cards, and Buddy Guy, bless him, has plenty enough talent without having to prove that he can act, which i am sad to say, he can't. There was also a little bit of an overdose on the folksy wisdom a time or two, but I found most of the film surprising. I was definitely surprised and it exceeded my expectations.

Tavernier, a big fan of American crime fiction (he previously adapted Jim Thompson'sPop. 1280intoCoup de Torchon - Criterion Collection), jumped at the chance to bring James Lee Burke's bestselling novelIn the Electric Mist with Confederate Deadto the big screen. However, reports surfaced that Tavernier and the film's star, Tommy Lee Jones, did not get along, and the producers were not happy with the director's version. As a result, the version released on DVD in North America is the producers' cut and not Tavernier's.Tavernier does an excellent job capturing the local color of the area in the scenes where protagonist Dave Robicheaux (Tommy Lee Jones) canvases the locals. The entire film was shot on location and this only enhances the authenticity of the story's setting which is rich in atmosphere - also helped by the liberal use of blues and zydeco music. The cinematography has a textured quality to it that really brings out the lushness of the region.The cast is outstanding with Tommy Lee Jones doing his patented gruff yet savvy lawman, Peter Sarsgaard portraying a boozy actor, and John Goodman as a scene-stealing mobster with a genial facade that barely masks a threatening demeanor. The cast is rounded out by fascinating veteran character actors like Mary Steenburgen, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Ned Beatty.Despite the production and post-production problems that plagued the film, this version is engaging and entertaining but one still wonders what Tavernier's original cut is like.Sadly, the only special features are a theatrical trailer but considering the bad blood between director and the producers this is hardly suprising.",4,Not the Director's Cut but Still Very Entertaining,1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,1845,"['Electric', 'Mist', 'marks', 'legendary', 'French', 'filmmaker', 'Bertrand', 'Tavernier', 'first', 'North', 'American-made', 'motion', 'picture', 'based', 'troubles', 'encountered', 'making', 'perhaps', 'last', 'Tavernier', 'big', 'fan', 'American', 'crime', 'fiction', 'previously', 'adapted', 'Jim', ""Thompson'sPop"", '1280intoCoup', 'Torchon', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'jumped', 'chance', 'bring', 'James', 'Lee', 'Burke', 'bestselling', 'Electric', 'Mist', 'Confederate', 'Deadto', 'big', 'screen', 'However', 'reports', 'surfaced', 'Tavernier', 'film', 'star', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'along', 'producers', 'were', 'not', 'happy', 'director', 'version', 'result', 'version', 'released', 'DVD', 'North', 'America', 'producers', 'cut', 'not', ""Tavernier's.Tavernier"", 'excellent', 'job', 'capturing', 'local', 'color', 'area', 'scenes', 'where', 'protagonist', 'Dave', 'Robicheaux', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'locals', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'only', 'authenticity', 'story', 'setting', 'rich', 'atmosphere', 'also', 'helped', 'liberal', 'use', 'blues', 'zydeco', 'music', 'cinematography', 'textured', 'quality', 'really', 'out', 'lushness', 'region.The', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'doing', 'patented', 'gruff', 'yet', 'savvy', 'lawman', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'portraying', 'boozy', 'actor', 'John', 'Goodman', 'scene-stealing', 'mobster', 'genial', 'facade', 'barely', 'threatening', 'demeanor', 'cast', 'rounded', 'out', 'fascinating', 'veteran', 'character', 'actors', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Vince', 'Ned', 'Beatty.Despite', 'production', 'post-production', 'problems', 'plagued', 'film', 'version', 'engaging', 'entertaining', 'one', 'still', 'what', 'Tavernier', 'original', 'cut', 'like.Sadly', 'only', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'considering', 'bad', 'blood', 'director', 'producers', 'hardly', 'suprising']",N/A

Tommy Lee Jones, the absolute perfect actor for a Louisiana policeman. John Goodman, the perfect pig of a criminal. Ned Betty as a slimy owner of a sugar factory. Buddy Guy, my goodness, blues legend BUDDY GUY. The backdrop of the aftermath of Katrina. The list just goes on and on.What went wrong? There's no blues music in this movie, except for one party scene. Why in the world wasn't Buddy Guy used to advantage (he's a horrible actor by the way)? The editing is a terrible mess. There are montages that are perfectly constructed, they leave the viewer guessing or wondering what will happen next. There are some that leave out massive details and expect the viewer to fill in, nice effect when done properly (assumes an intelligent audience). Then there is the bulk of the film, edited straight like a melodrama. The voice over narration works for a time, but the technique gets lost and way under used. It's jarring anytime it returns.The worst part of the film, there's a sort of happily ever after ending to a fairly dark movie. There's no real need to know what each character is doing later in life.What was well done - Tommy Lee Jones. Since he is 95% of the film, he plays his role to perfection and is compelling. The cinematography is mostly very well done (there's a few hand held shots that look like reshoots that were poor at best). The dialog is generally clear.The mystery itself is middle of the road. For murder mysteries to work, there has to be fortelling of who did it. The viewer has to have some kind of clues or chance in a million to figure out the murder. All seems very well in this film, the first murder solution progresses along. Then the old murder and a couple of new ones are added. The mystery starts to make less and less sense. It turns needlessly convoluted forcing the viewer to thin, well just tell me already, I'm tired of trying to figure this out. So once the murder is revealed, it's a major let down.The DVD is sparse, film, preview, plus the theatrical trailer. Rated R, but I have no real good clue why it got an R rating.

1219374,A1M9M032XI1P49,B001NFNFF8,Duane Damon,"[1, 1]","Of the modern mystery authors I've read, James Lee Burke is very possibly the most gifted. At moments his prose soars to near-poetry, his insights into humanity's greatness and smallness are impressive, as are his descriptions of the physical world his characters inhabit. ""In the Electric Mist With Confederate Dead"" is one of my favorite Dave Robicheaux novels, and I was pleased to learn that Tommy Lee Jones was starring in a film version of it. Unfortunately, ""In the Electric Mist,"" as the movie is called, was a little disappoining. The script actually follows the novel very closely, and it was easy to see that Jones, the scriptwriters and director all had an affection (and respect) for the material, which I appreciated. But the movie's faithfulness to the book may have been, I think, part of the problem. There were simply too many characters and scenes in the novel to put into a less than 2-hour film for the finished product to be as effective as it might. Tommy Lee Jones turned in a fine performance as the angst-ridden, but formidable Robicheaux and John Goodman was good as Baby Feet Balboni. (I'd like to have seen more of Mary Steenburgen as Bootsie.) But while many of the scenes worked well, a number of others had an unfinished or glossed-over feel to them -- possibly the result of having to edit a little too heavily to hold down the length of the picture. Despite its flaws, however, ""In the Electric Mist"" was a noble effort at bringing the work of a top-drawer author together with a top-notch actor, and I salute Jones and company for making it happen.

1219383,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B001NFNFF8,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","I've never read any of James Lee Burke's books but he seems to be well thought of and has an avid army of fans. I looked forward to seeing this, partly because of the cast, but also because there has been a pretty good record as of late with studios taking the books of well honed American authors and turning them into films.This is a hit and miss. Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman, Peter Sarsgaard and Mary Steenburgen are only part of a large and well seasoned cast. The director, Bertrand Tavernier is also well seasoned with 33 films to his credit, but somehow this project doesn't hang together.Here's the scoop. Set in Louisiana, Tommy Lee plays a police captain who is ready to bust Sarsgaard, a Hollywood actor in town for a film shoot, on a DUI. To avoid said DUI Peter leads Tommy to an area of the swamp where he spotted a corpse shackled in chains. Even though the body has been dead since the 60s Tommy wants to investigate. Meanwhile, a young prostitute from town is murdered and Tommy wants to make the connection between the two which leads him to investigate all manner of unseemly persons.Nearly every scene in this movie was written and acted extremely well. A lot of really cool things happened in the plotting. Most of the characters, even the secondary ones, had a lot of personality, but it all failed to dovetail. Like the dead guy in chains. He's what started the whole thing off but very little is done in regard to that part of the story. And it didn't build up tension. It kept a generally even keel throughout. This might be truer to how real life is but it doesn't make for exciting movies.This is an imminently watchable film with a lot going for it, but if you're at all like me, you might walk away from it shrugging your shoulders.",3,The Whole is Less Than the Sum of It's Parts,1316822400,"09 24, 2011",2011,1763,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'James', 'Lee', 'Burke', 'books', 'be', 'well', 'thought', 'avid', 'army', 'fans', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'partly', 'cast', 'also', 'been', 'pretty', 'good', 'record', 'late', 'studios', 'taking', 'books', 'well', 'honed', 'American', 'authors', 'turning', 'films.This', 'hit', 'miss', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'are', 'only', 'part', 'large', 'well', 'seasoned', 'cast', 'director', 'Bertrand', 'Tavernier', 'also', 'well', 'seasoned', '33', 'films', 'credit', 'somehow', 'project', ""n't"", 'hang', 'scoop', 'Set', 'Louisiana', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'police', 'captain', 'who', 'ready', 'bust', 'Sarsgaard', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'town', 'film', 'shoot', 'DUI', 'avoid', 'said', 'DUI', 'Peter', 'Tommy', 'area', 'swamp', 'where', 'spotted', 'corpse', 'shackled', 'chains', 'Even', 'body', 'been', 'dead', '60s', 'Tommy', 'investigate', 'Meanwhile', 'young', 'prostitute', 'town', 'murdered', 'Tommy', 'make', 'connection', 'two', 'investigate', 'manner', 'unseemly', 'persons.Nearly', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'acted', 'extremely', 'well', 'lot', 'really', 'cool', 'things', 'happened', 'plotting', 'Most', 'characters', 'even', 'secondary', 'ones', 'had', 'lot', 'personality', 'failed', 'dovetail', 'dead', 'guy', 'chains', 'what', 'started', 'whole', 'thing', 'off', 'very', 'little', 'done', 'regard', 'part', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'build', 'up', 'tension', 'kept', 'generally', 'even', 'keel', 'might', 'be', 'truer', 'how', 'real', 'life', ""n't"", 'make', 'exciting', 'movies.This', 'imminently', 'watchable', 'film', 'lot', 'going', ""'re"", 'might', 'walk', 'away', 'shrugging', 'shoulders']",N/A

But then, he's a dead ringer for author James Burke, no surprise. I find the JLB books ultimately well-crafted but just a mite bit depressing - nobody in them ever seems to grow, and that's the essence of a soul-satisfying flick. What Women Think, for example. Mel Gibson's character is a perfect A.H. the way he treats women. After falling in a bath tub with a hair dryer, he can hear women's thoughts. His heart expands to embrace their realities, and he becomes a better man. Makes us feel good. Ancient sage of East say: Expansion of Awareness Equals Happiness. Nothing like that happens in the JLB books, alas. Dave R remains an irritable though well-intentioned son of a gun whose flaws disappoint us.

Burke isn't a great writer; at times he overwrites and may wax eloquent about an old rocking chair on a porch for far longer than necessary. I suspect he hasn't followed Fitzgerald's dictum's of a writer sometimes having to 'kill his babies,' meaning the most elegant, expressive writing in a book may not fit the book and thus must be expunged to lend integrity to it.  That being said, to take all the inner reflections--both emotional and philosophical--and to be able to interweave them with a rather complex narrative is done well in this movie by laconic dialogue that packs a punch, and includes a good use of voice over to get an insight into the protagonist's perspective of his world--one learned over decades as a citizen/observor and law enforcer. You really should read Burke's books first, even one, just to get a grip on his style as well as to understand the idioloic nature of the Louisiana accent and regionalism.  Now I think Tommy Lee Jones does a good job as the lead, but he's not perfect--perhaps because no one could be perfect for to internalize the complexities of a character who has as many sides to him as Hamlet would require a lot of work, and the script simply does not provide that opportunity.  A novel such as this one deserves a longer treatment. I can't imagine it being shorter than 135 minutes--needed to truly get into the world of the story which is the world of a culture both past and present, and a world of a man seeing his culture devolve into decadence and greed.

Louisiana is strange by definition but the crimes in that place on the bayou are more than strange, they are bizarre, frightening too. The killing of several girls leads to some kind of pervert who provides himself with some kind of absolutely clandestine mission. But his interest is also to work for some white money men who are in business and in many other activities under the table and even under the water, and behind the screen, the big screen of the cinema. Another murder comes up, after vtwenty years or more of rotting in the bayou, a black man who managed to be the lover of the wife of one of these few white business men whose business is shady even if their complexion is rosy. The cop has to go through all kinds of forms of intimidation, right out and right away violence and physical or police pressure. He just goes on to the end. He uses some methods that are not entirely correct but the result is the same: justice, and in this case his justice is justice, though not exactly in a court of justice, rather in the back of justice. The rhythm is also slightly slow. The best part is the haunting vision of some southern confederate general more or less playing hooky with our crime stories. But that's only a touch of naivet&eacute; and superstition. The whole thing is the best American French film, or is it the best French American film, I have seen for a while.

This movie is lifted with almost complete fidelity from his novel and the movie suffers from a stasis in which the plot moves forward not at all or slowly. Tommy Lee Jones acts as if his questionable charisma is all that is needed to make a film work well. The lack of any forward propulsion of the plot in many scenes in the movie is frustrating for the viewer. The first half-hour, which should ""hook"" us into watching the film, is a non-starter: slow and boring. Back to Jones for one final comment: he has acted well in some movies, most particularly No Country For Old Men. But in this film he has a solid and credible context in which to act out his character. It doesn't hurt that this film is very good, largely because it is faithfully based on a novel by the profoundly good novelist Cormac MacCarthy.Ultimately, a movie must be judged by narrative success (a movie is not a static painting or sculpture).

Although I loved the authenticity of the landscape in this film, as well as the actors, especially Tommy Lee Jones, I found myself confused at times, especially in light of the fact that the dead prostitute cases didn't seem to have much to do with the murder in 1965.  At the end, I still didn't understand completely why the women were killed, or, why the African-American man was killed in 1965.  I know it had been implied in a few conversations along the way that he ""messed with a white man's wife,"" but I wish that someone had explained that whole story in more detail.  I also didn't understand why the man killed the prostitutes.  Was he crazy?  Did they know something?  That wasn't made clear.  I'm sure if I had read the book, it would have all made sense.  In any case, the film was definitely entertaining and Jones was great.  There is something purely mystical about the bayous of Louisiana - so rich in history both bad and good, and teaming with character and culture.

Big mistake.  Important characters remain one-dimensional, ancillary crimes remain unsolved and--by the writers/filmmakers, at least--forgotten, and the lead character, Robicheaux, exists on two planes: violence and cynicism.  In the novel, the characters are fully realized, interesting, believable.  But every character in this movie--through  no fault of the actors--seems little more than a plot device.

The director captured the mood, tone, and scenery to the point that one can almost feel the stifling southern humidity in ones lungs while watching this.Robicheaux has problems of his own while trying to investigate and there are many twists and turns, each one seemingly to prohibit his quest of solving these murders.There is a whole local dynamic that further obscures the truth for him. There are cultural misunderstandings, veiled feuds, and southern racial tensions that further impede his progress.Robicheaux also has the problem of the evil mobster, Balboni, to contend with. John Goodman's performance of the epitome of evil in this film practically stole the show for me. This role will remind people of just how talented he is.Due to his dealings with all of the nefariousness and people who do not want him to solve the crimes, one is led through the movie wondering it Robicheaux will make it through without killing more people or being killed himself.I know that the director could have done a better job with the suspense as compared to the book but Tommy Lee Jones' intensity, commanding performance, and the believability of the story pulled me through whatever lapses in script structure and pacing in the movie that were there. I would most strongly recommend this film to anyone who has read the books.

I really did. I found ""In The Electric Mist"" to be a very compelling story - powerful acted and cleverly told. And something of undiscovered gem.Once again Tommy Lee Jones as the haggard and troubled lead - just stuns - his depth and power fill the screen absolutely all of the time. Credit must also go to the uniformly superb supporting cast too (even if in some cases they don't get a lot to do) - John Goodman, Peter Sarsgaard, Mary Steenburgen, Ned Beatty, Kelly MacDonald, Pruitt Taylor-Vince, Justina Machado and even Buddy Guy (the blues guitar player) - all good. And then there's Levon Helm of the famous Americana rock group THE BAND as the ghost of a Confederate General - adding extraordinary old-world gravitas and mystery to the piece.The Blu Ray print is BEAUTIFUL too - even in the dark interiors - but especially in the outdoor swamp shots and town houses. Disappointingly though, there are precious few extras.Bertrand Tavernier's film isn't a masterpiece for sure, and it's perhaps just a little 'too' in love with its own gumbo and Louisiana scenery, but I found it immensely moving in places - and awkwardly real - especially on the core subject of racism and its still lingering malevolent presence (the title of this review is a rumination by one of the characters on that subject when a dead body from 1965 comes back to haunt him).The film reminded me of John Sayles at his best (""Passion Fish"" for instance) - full of heart and great observation - which is high praise indeed...I'd say ignore the so-so reviews and put it high on your rental list.

But somehow it all ends up seeming contrived--like Hollywood's version of Louisiana.Burke's books are complex, involving many, many characters and subplots, and the film tries to include everything.

Based on the James Lee Burke novel ""In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead"", the movie finds Burke's Cajun detective Dave Robicheaux once again hot on the trail of a brutal killer. In addition to dealing with the current killing of a young prostitute, Robicheaux must address troubling memories of a murder he witnessed more than 40 years ago as a boy. Throw in for good measure his daily grapple with alcoholism and bizarre visions of conversations with Civil War Confederate General John Bell Hood, who at best gives convoluted advice. Robicheaux (and the viewer) must decide if General Hood's presence in his life is represented by simple reveries brought on by alcohol, or a very real manifestation of the dead coming back to life in order to right a wrong. The latter assertion seems feasable, when one considers the mystical ethic of rural Louisiana where the story unfolds (focus on the last scene of the film for corroboration). Tommy Lee Jones is brilliant as the troubled, flawed, yet highly effective Robicheaux. One can't think of a better choice of actor.

It's a linear detective story that holds the attention nicely.  Based on the James Lee Burke novel, it offers some of the atmospherics that are the hallmark of Burke's art; it also has some Burkean lines thrown in for good measure.  The casting is (finally) excellent, with Tommy Lee Jones as Dave and other stalwarts like John Goodman, Ned Beatty and the wonderful Buddy Guy.  Those who are unfamiliar with the Robicheaux novels may find themselves struggling to catch up, though there are various exposition points which help fill in the blanks.  The film (like the book) includes scenes in which an LSD-doped Dave begins talking to confederate warriors (here, in particular, John Bell Hood).  This translates to 'magic realism' in the book and here the magic is in Levon Helm's performance as Hood.The Burke novels are so richly textured that the film seems somewhat lean, but it is better to attempt to capture some of the novels' atmosphere than to abandon the attempt.  Jonathan Kellerman has called Burke the Faulkner of crime fiction and here we get a hint of what that means.  The old south and the new converge in a haunted tale in which Dave himself, as a child, played a part.The sets are excellent, particularly the brief post-Katrina glimpse of New Orleans.  Dave's house and bait shop are just as we would imagine them.  So too are the dingy bars on the back roads of New Iberia.  We even get a glimpse of Alafair's three-legged raccoon, Tripod.

Movies have come to Dave Robicheaux's (Tommy Lee Jones) Louisiana parish.  Actors Elrod Sykes (Peter Sarsgaard) and Kelly Drummond (Kelly Macdonald) are filming a Civil War battle epic. Unfortunately, Elrod has a drinking and drug problem.

1219508,A3FWHXSZSTKFIU,B001NFNFF8,Scott Woods,"[4, 5]","This film marks the second time novelist James Lee Burke's Cajun detective Dave Robicheaux has been brought to film, the first being Alec Baldwin's remarkably un-Cajun version in ""Heaven's Prisoners"" back in 1996.  The first film was solid, but it wasn't quite the magic a series needs to launch, nor did it capture critics or audience.  This film doesn't fare much better, but not for the same reasons.James Lee Burke's gift as a writer isn't complex mysteries, but complex characters and a poetic way of describing Louisiana country.  Only one of these gifts (cinematography) tends to resonate well in a film of what we've come to consider ""average"" length.  So things that propel his novels, like Dave's inner monologues, are mostly cast aside and when they do appear they come off as expositional and flat.Another thing that works against these adaptations is their endings, which is not their fault.  Burke's villains are clear, not very mysterious, and the endings are fairly stock.  They work in the book because the book is mostly a character study of its protagonist.  When applied to these films, however, this tact feels anti-climactic.It also bears pointing out that neither of these films features a key fun element: Dave's right-hand man Clet Purcell (a role many Burke fans thought Goodman would be perfect for), which is in keeping with their respective titles, but does lose some of the magic of better books in the series.  Neither of these books reflects the highest moments of the series overall, so they're hard-pressed to launch the films they become into the stratosphere (and in the case of In the Electric Mist, even into US. theaters).  This adapatation is also hurt by a very unlikely source: the Will Patton-read audiobooks.  Patton does such a phenomenal job capturing the tone and characterizations of Burke's world that it's hard not to see Robicheaux as Patton (who I was bucking for Hollywood to hire, but knew it was unlikely).  I kept peeking around the corners, waiting for that perfect gravely voice to lay it all out for me, but it never came.Electric Mist has plain direction and largely feels like an homage and not an interpretation.  The director's (Bertrand Tavernier doing his first U.S. made film) love of American crime novels is no secret, but parts of this film come off as mild fan fiction:  I love me some Buddy guy, but he can't act.  Levon Helm has some pedigree, but never made his bread and butter off of acting either, and in such an understated role here, it shows.  These are vanity choices by a director enamored of American icons, not American acting.  The people in this film that can act are largely being restrained in the name of understated performances.  Even the big bad guy loses a key scene in the book where he takes a shot at Dave (batter up!) and with little else to hang his menace on, John Goodman just comes off like a storm cloud with no rain in it.  I credit the crew with largely sticking to the book and avoiding knee-jerk Hollywood-isms, like trying to explain the ethnicity of Dave's child or back track through half a dozen books for back story.For all intents and purposes you could watch these films back-to-back and get a nice snapshot of Burke's world, even if the characterizations of the lead are vastly different.  It's interesting to see how different the acting is in roles that cross both films. Some of it is better in the first film (Badja Jola as Batist is way more engaging than Walter Breaux, and Hawthorne James is more menacing than any of the villains in Electric Mist).  Jones is a better Dave.  Mix it up and you'd have had a better film all around.There are great movies that could be made of Burke's books.  Putting more surgical directors on the job would be a good place to start; picking the right book is a close second.  Somewhere between the moodiness of the first film and the clean lines of the second is a great adaptation worthy of launching a series.  And at this point, I'm down with Tommy Lee Jones doing it across the board.  He's got the grit and the soul, even if he does slip into typical Tommy Lee Jones stoicism a lot more than Robicheaux might warrant.  Fans of the books should check it out anyway.",3,Somewhere between the first and second films is the right film,1240617600,"04 25, 2009",2009,4222,"['film', 'second', 'time', 'novelist', 'James', 'Lee', 'Burke', 'Cajun', 'detective', 'Dave', 'Robicheaux', 'been', 'brought', 'film', 'first', 'being', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'remarkably', 'un-Cajun', 'version', 'Heaven', 'Prisoners', 'back', '1996', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'solid', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'magic', 'series', 'launch', 'did', 'capture', 'critics', 'audience', 'film', ""n't"", 'fare', 'much', 'better', 'not', 'same', 'reasons.James', 'Lee', 'Burke', 'gift', 'writer', ""n't"", 'complex', 'mysteries', 'complex', 'characters', 'poetic', 'way', 'describing', 'Louisiana', 'country', 'Only', 'one', 'gifts', 'cinematography', 'resonate', 'well', 'film', 'what', ""'ve"", 'come', 'consider', 'average', 'length', 'things', 'propel', 'novels', 'Dave', 'inner', 'monologues', 'are', 'mostly', 'cast', 'aside', 'when', 'do', 'come', 'off', 'expositional', 'flat.Another', 'thing', 'adaptations', 'endings', 'not', 'fault', 'Burke', 'villains', 'are', 'clear', 'not', 'very', 'mysterious', 'endings', 'are', 'fairly', 'stock', 'work', 'book', 'book', 'mostly', 'character', 'study', 'protagonist', 'When', 'applied', 'films', 'however', 'tact', 'feels', 'anti-climactic.It', 'also', 'pointing', 'out', 'films', 'key', 'fun', 'element', 'Dave', 'right-hand', 'man', 'Clet', 'Purcell', 'role', 'many', 'Burke', 'fans', 'thought', 'Goodman', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'keeping', 'respective', 'titles', 'lose', 'magic', 'better', 'books', 'series', 'books', 'highest', 'moments', 'series', 'overall', ""'re"", 'hard-pressed', 'launch', 'films', 'become', 'stratosphere', 'case', 'Electric', 'Mist', 'even', 'US', 'theaters', 'adapatation', 'also', 'hurt', 'very', 'unlikely', 'source', 'Will', 'Patton-read', 'audiobooks', 'Patton', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'capturing', 'tone', 'characterizations', 'Burke', 'world', 'hard', 'not', 'see', 'Robicheaux', 'Patton', 'who', 'was', 'bucking', 'Hollywood', 'hire', 'knew', 'was', 'unlikely', 'kept', 'peeking', 'corners', 'waiting', 'perfect', 'gravely', 'voice', 'lay', 'out', 'never', 'came.Electric', 'Mist', 'plain', 'direction', 'largely', 'feels', 'homage', 'not', 'interpretation', 'director', 'Bertrand', 'Tavernier', 'doing', 'first', 'U.S.', 'made', 'film', 'love', 'American', 'crime', 'novels', 'secret', 'parts', 'film', 'come', 'off', 'mild', 'fan', 'fiction', 'love', 'Buddy', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'Levon', 'Helm', 'pedigree', 'never', 'made', 'bread', 'butter', 'acting', 'such', 'understated', 'role', 'here', 'are', 'vanity', 'choices', 'director', 'enamored', 'American', 'icons', 'not', 'American', 'acting', 'people', 'film', 'can', 'act', 'are', 'largely', 'being', 'restrained', 'name', 'understated', 'performances', 'Even', 'big', 'bad', 'guy', 'key', 'scene', 'book', 'where', 'shot', 'Dave', 'batter', 'up', 'little', 'else', 'hang', 'menace', 'John', 'Goodman', 'just', 'off', 'storm', 'cloud', 'rain', 'credit', 'crew', 'largely', 'sticking', 'book', 'avoiding', 'knee-jerk', 'Hollywood-isms', 'trying', 'explain', 'ethnicity', 'Dave', 'child', 'back', 'track', 'dozen', 'books', 'back', 'story.For', 'intents', 'purposes', 'could', 'watch', 'films', 'back-to-back', 'get', 'nice', 'snapshot', 'Burke', 'world', 'even', 'characterizations', 'lead', 'are', 'vastly', 'different', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'different', 'acting', 'roles', 'cross', 'films', 'better', 'first', 'film', 'Badja', 'Jola', 'Batist', 'way', 'more', 'engaging', 'Walter', 'Breaux', 'Hawthorne', 'James', 'more', 'menacing', 'villains', 'Electric', 'Mist', 'Jones', 'better', 'Dave', 'Mix', 'up', ""'d"", 'have', 'had', 'better', 'film', 'around.There', 'are', 'great', 'movies', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'Burke', 'books', 'Putting', 'more', 'surgical', 'directors', 'job', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'picking', 'right', 'book', 'close', 'second', 'Somewhere', 'moodiness', 'first', 'film', 'clean', 'lines', 'second', 'great', 'adaptation', 'worthy', 'launching', 'series', 'point', ""'m"", 'down', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'doing', 'board', 'got', 'grit', 'soul', 'even', 'slip', 'typical', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'stoicism', 'lot', 'more', 'Robicheaux', 'might', 'warrant', 'Fans', 'books', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'anyway']",N/A

1219510,A2ZGHESQDCI77M,B001NFNFF8,"Shiloh True ""Rabid Reader""","[3, 4]","I consider, 'In The Electric Mist With The Confederate Dead,' released in 1993, some of the best of Burke---and his character, Robicheaux. I had the opportunity to listen to the book, way back then, on tape.  Now this was not the 'usual' audio book.  It was complete with eerie sound effects and so expertly done, that my family camped out in the living room, turned out all the lights and we made an evening out of this extraordinary tale.While I don't believe this movie adaptation, 'In the Electric Mist, holds a candle to that first experience, it still provided a great visit, with characters that I came to love, over a decade and a half ago. It was this previous introduction that turned me on to Burke and destined me to become a loyal, forever fan.I'm not sure why, but I've always rather envisioned Robicheaux's character to look something like the dark, craggy, and grumpy, Kinky Friedman. And in real life, he rather does. However, if given a list of potential actors, I would have placed Tommy Lee Jones on the short list, for some of the same physical characteristics. I was able to completely identify him with the role, although I could have used a tad more accent.Robicheaux is an alcoholic, struggling to stay in remission, with many skeletons in his closet, including witnessing a black man being gunned down in the swamps, many years previously---something he chose to remain silent about.  He can no longer remain in denial, when a member of a filming crew working in the swamps, comes across the bones.  In the midst of this event, grizzly murders of prostitutes begin to take place---murders he would love to pin on his sleazy nemesis, the mobster, played by John Goodman.The character who plays Robicheaux's daughter, Alafair, provides some nail-biting moments toward the end of the movie, as well. To digress, I've always loved the way Burke's real daughter is named Alafair and the way he sets up such a bond between Alafair and Robicheaux, in all of his work. I find this sweet and endearing.As Robicheaux begins his investigations, he has hallucinogenic encounters with a troop of Confederate Soldiers, under the famous John Bell Hood. Hood becomes Robicheaux's ghostly sub-conscience, offering insights into seeking and finding truth---an all knowing wisdom, from the grave.The movie is not high on budget and in some respects, it looks almost like a made for TV drama.  However, they still managed to capture the mysterious Cajun atmosphere, making you feel you might just have to start swatting skeeters. I wish there had been more development of the supernatural aspects---the war, the soldiers.  In the book and audio version, this was hair-raisingly spooky, but not so much in this movie.There were a couple of superficial mentions of Katrina, bringing us more up to the moment with Louisiana, which felt a little out of place, because we were dealing with another place and time, with the original story.

From the word go this had a `made for TV' quality about it, whether it be from the cheap and dated soundtrack or the wooden acting from the townsfolk supporting cast; pretty soon into this film you realise that this isn't going to be ground breaking stuff. Lee Jones is definitely acting by rote here and there is a lack of passion throughout. It doesn't live up to his usual high standards. This had a slow start and little hook or drama and the terrible dialogue made me cringe at numerous times whilst watching. By the time the film ends you are hoping for some kind of twist or shock ending, but instead you get very little coherence between scarce plot lines and not a great deal left of the story that bears any relation to anything else. There is no real motive or back story to the murderers actions and you are left doubting the credibility of the entire film. As you can see there isn't a great deal to commend this film for and to be honest you can miss this and not worry in the slightest.

1219513,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B001NFNFF8,Stephanie De Pue,"[1, 1]","IN THE ELECTRIC MIST, (In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead), (2008). This 102 minute thriller, helmed by the well-thought of French director Bertrand Tavernier, (Round Midnight) centers on characters created by beloved, bestselling American author of crime dramas, James Lee Burke.  The mystery is set in and around New Orleans, Burke's home, French-speaking turf, after the terrible damage inflicted  on the region in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina.  Principally, it tells us of troubled former New Orleans Police Detective Dave Robicheaux, now a deputy sheriff in neighboring Iberia County. The lead part is fully inhabited by veteran Texas-born actor Tommy Lee Jones, (Men In Black,The Fugitive), who might well have been born to play it, as it was created by the Texas Panhandle-born Burke.The stubborn Robichaux, haunted by his service in the Vietnam War, struggling with a drinking problem, is, as ever, ignoring warnings to leave the local messes alone.  He begins to investigate the possible connections between a series of torture murders of local prostitutes, a 1976 lynching that he witnessed 35 years before as a young boy, and Julie `Baby Feet' Balboni, a notorious New Orleans gangster, played by the popular St. Louis-born John Goodman,(The Big Easy). The Southern-born Mary Steenburgen, (Cross Creek), plays Bootsie, the detective's second wife.  Peter Sarsgaard, (Year of the Dog), plays actor Elrod Sykes, filming locally; Kelly Macdonald, (Intermission), is Sykes' girlfriend Kelly Drummond.  Ned Beatty, (Hear My Song) plays local rich man/bad guy Twinky LeMoyne.  Noted American musician Levon Helm plays long-dead General John Bell Hood, a Civil War stalwart who suddenly starts appearing to and chatting with Robicheaux and Sykes.  Noted American bluesman Buddy Guy plays local bluesman Sam `Hogman' Patin.  Director John Sayles plays Michael Goldman, producer of the picture filming locally. Marco Beltrami created the evocative score; Bruno de Keyzer, the cinematography.  The plot sticks recognizably close to Burke's underlying novel of the same name,In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead.Jones nails the part of Burke's detective, giving us a rounded performance that shows the complex nature of the character, violent one minute, tender the next.  He is miles better than Alec Baldwin, who was laughably miscast as the detective in HEAVENS PRISONERS.  And it's not a bad movie.  Yet, my understanding is that, although this film was made for theatrical release, it eventually went directly to DVD, which is probably why I, for one, although I am a Burke fan, never knew of its existence until I was informed of it by my Amazon friends.  I think some major structural problems may have caused that outcome.  Any Burke fan will know the detective's best friend, another former NOPD detective, Clete Purcel, overweight, sunburnt, heavy drinker, violent, everlastingly loyal, also native to NO's Irish Channel. Therefore, any Burke fan who has been to the movies a few times, in seeing the cast list before seeing the picture, will expect that Ned Beatty is playing Purcel.  I did.  But, somehow, the Purcel character isn't there, and Beatty is playing one of the heavies.  Also, Goodman has long been associated with The Big Easy, and it was perfectly reasonable to cast him as the gangster in this gritty film.  But Goodman, I believe, is a popular actor, and I suspect people may be uncomfortable with the way he is here treated.  I was.  Both these misjudgments create a film that's disappointing, but I still enjoyed it, as most Burke fans might.",3,"Not a Bad Movie, But Some Serious Misjudgements",1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,3583,"['IN', 'THE', 'ELECTRIC', 'MIST', 'Electric', 'Mist', 'Confederate', 'Dead', '2008', '102', 'minute', 'thriller', 'helmed', 'well-thought', 'French', 'director', 'Bertrand', 'Tavernier', 'Round', 'Midnight', 'centers', 'characters', 'created', 'beloved', 'bestselling', 'American', 'author', 'crime', 'dramas', 'James', 'Lee', 'Burke', 'mystery', 'set', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Burke', 'home', 'French-speaking', 'turf', 'terrible', 'damage', 'inflicted', 'region', '2005', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'Principally', 'troubled', 'former', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Police', 'Detective', 'Dave', 'Robicheaux', 'now', 'deputy', 'sheriff', 'neighboring', 'Iberia', 'County', 'lead', 'part', 'fully', 'inhabited', 'veteran', 'Texas-born', 'actor', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Men', 'Black', 'Fugitive', 'who', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'play', 'was', 'created', 'Texas', 'Panhandle-born', 'Burke.The', 'stubborn', 'Robichaux', 'haunted', 'service', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'struggling', 'drinking', 'problem', 'ever', 'ignoring', 'warnings', 'leave', 'local', 'messes', 'alone', 'investigate', 'possible', 'connections', 'series', 'torture', 'murders', 'local', 'prostitutes', '1976', 'lynching', 'witnessed', '35', 'years', 'before', 'young', 'boy', 'Julie', 'Baby', 'Feet', 'Balboni', 'notorious', 'New', 'Orleans', 'gangster', 'played', 'popular', 'St.', 'Louis-born', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Big', 'Easy', 'Southern-born', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Cross', 'Creek', 'Bootsie', 'detective', 'second', 'wife', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Year', 'Dog', 'actor', 'Elrod', 'Sykes', 'filming', 'locally', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'Intermission', 'Sykes', 'girlfriend', 'Kelly', 'Drummond', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'Hear', 'My', 'Song', 'local', 'rich', 'man/bad', 'guy', 'Twinky', 'LeMoyne', 'Noted', 'American', 'musician', 'Levon', 'Helm', 'long-dead', 'General', 'John', 'Bell', 'Hood', 'Civil', 'War', 'stalwart', 'who', 'suddenly', 'appearing', 'chatting', 'Robicheaux', 'Sykes', 'Noted', 'American', 'bluesman', 'Buddy', 'Guy', 'local', 'bluesman', 'Sam', 'Hogman', 'Patin', 'Director', 'John', 'Sayles', 'Michael', 'Goldman', 'producer', 'picture', 'filming', 'locally', 'Marco', 'Beltrami', 'created', 'evocative', 'score', 'Bruno', 'de', 'Keyzer', 'cinematography', 'plot', 'recognizably', 'close', 'Burke', 'underlying', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Electric', 'Mist', 'Confederate', 'Dead.Jones', 'part', 'Burke', 'detective', 'giving', 'rounded', 'performance', 'complex', 'nature', 'character', 'violent', 'one', 'minute', 'tender', 'next', 'miles', 'better', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'was', 'laughably', 'miscast', 'detective', 'HEAVENS', 'PRISONERS', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'understanding', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'theatrical', 'release', 'eventually', 'went', 'directly', 'DVD', 'probably', 'why', 'one', 'am', 'Burke', 'fan', 'never', 'knew', 'existence', 'was', 'informed', 'Amazon', 'friends', 'think', 'major', 'structural', 'problems', 'may', 'have', 'caused', 'outcome', 'Burke', 'fan', 'will', 'know', 'detective', 'best', 'friend', 'former', 'NOPD', 'detective', 'Clete', 'Purcel', 'overweight', 'sunburnt', 'heavy', 'drinker', 'violent', 'everlastingly', 'loyal', 'also', 'native', 'NO', 'Irish', 'Channel', 'Therefore', 'Burke', 'fan', 'who', 'been', 'movies', 'few', 'times', 'seeing', 'cast', 'list', 'seeing', 'picture', 'will', 'expect', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'playing', 'Purcel', 'did', 'somehow', 'Purcel', 'character', ""n't"", 'there', 'Beatty', 'playing', 'one', 'heavies', 'Also', 'Goodman', 'long', 'been', 'associated', 'Big', 'Easy', 'was', 'perfectly', 'reasonable', 'cast', 'gangster', 'gritty', 'film', 'Goodman', 'believe', 'popular', 'actor', 'suspect', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'way', 'here', 'treated', 'was', 'Both', 'misjudgments', 'create', 'film', 'disappointing', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'Burke', 'fans', 'might']",N/A

To disclaim, I performed Civil War re-enacting for 8 years with the 5th Texas, and my family name matches the main character; Never have seen Robicheaux/Robechaud in any film. So that aside, I just watched a great Tommie Lee Jones film filled with Civil War history (including a great role by Levon Helm playing John Bell Hood) and modern bayou mystery. Also nice to see the Louisiana area get some film money injected into their economy.Plenty of upset people out there about the loss from the book series to film, but since I had not read any of the books, and I appreciate a film that doesn't spell every character out for you - this made for a solid, low-key suspense crime saga. Yes, there is a plethora of characters that pop in and out, obvious story lines not being conveyed in their entire sequence, and personality traits never explained with TLJ's violent/subdued split angles - but it all made (wholeheartedly) for a rewatchable film. Believable performances all around, and I hope to see them all again in more of these (like the successful Jesse Stone/Tom Selleck series). Nitpicking aside from other posters (Yes - there was Texas Cavalry in the Civil War) and the film being too short (I look forward to the other films being made), I hope people give this film a chance.The BD sound was excellent with the DTS, and some of the pans will test your display refresh rate (several sequences of low angles/pointing up with sky backdrops; vehicles driving along ridges, fan boats skimming along the bayou, etc.). Some of the music mix sounded perfect and the 1080p shows our flawed characters' shortcomings in ways I never imagined, including John Goodman in tight swim trunks.

The Robicheaux character is classic. Love the setting of the bayou, the swamps. that culture and the overhang of the misty murkiness of the atmosphere is brilliant, making everything appear as an illusion, a dream. Most of the really awful stuff happens off screen, the focus is more on the characters; the cast is excellent, Jones is so real and the solving of the crime isn't a cause for celebration, really, more like an opportunity for acceptance of reality as seen through Robicheaux's jaded, soulful eyes.

1219528,A1SB9Z4MSDOC8T,B001NFNFF8,Ulysses7245,"[0, 0]","Interesting adaptation of the James Lee Burke novel by the fine French director Bernard Tavernier, starring Tommy Lee Jones. Main problem is the script, which is fairly incoherent -- but then so was the novel. Most interesting thing about Burke's novels is the interior monologue of the main character, Dave Robicheaux -- the action mainly serves as a catalyst for Robicheaux's commentary. In the movie there's minimal voice-over, which ain't the same. One objection: Robicheaux is slipped some LSD in his iced tea and ends up in the hospital after running his truck into a (shallow) ditch and hallucinating up a storm. The hallucinations, and succeeding flashbacks, involve a philosophical dialogue with a dead Civil War general, who'd fought in the area 100 years before. Sorry, Hollywood: those ain't like any LSD hallucinations I ever experienced -- too clean, to coherent. Tavernier does his best with a weak script (& his work is always worth watching -- see &#34;Round Midnight&#34; as the best example). And Tommy Lee Jones is probably the best Dave Robicheaux we can expect. I had hoped for more, but it appears Burke is as hard to adapt as Richard Stark (Payback, Point Blank, The Outfit).",3,In the Electric Mist,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,1199,"['Interesting', 'adaptation', 'James', 'Lee', 'Burke', 'novel', 'fine', 'French', 'director', 'Bernard', 'Tavernier', 'starring', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Main', 'problem', 'script', 'fairly', 'incoherent', 'then', 'so', 'was', 'novel', 'Most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'Burke', 'novels', 'interior', 'monologue', 'main', 'character', 'Dave', 'Robicheaux', 'action', 'mainly', 'catalyst', 'Robicheaux', 'commentary', 'movie', 'minimal', 'voice-over', 'ai', ""n't"", 'same', 'One', 'objection', 'Robicheaux', 'slipped', 'LSD', 'iced', 'tea', 'up', 'hospital', 'running', 'truck', 'shallow', 'ditch', 'hallucinating', 'up', 'storm', 'hallucinations', 'succeeding', 'flashbacks', 'involve', 'philosophical', 'dialogue', 'dead', 'Civil', 'War', 'general', 'who', ""'d"", 'fought', 'area', '100', 'years', 'before', 'Sorry', 'Hollywood', 'ai', ""n't"", 'LSD', 'hallucinations', 'ever', 'experienced', 'too', 'clean', 'coherent', 'Tavernier', 'best', 'weak', 'script', 'work', 'always', 'worth', 'watching', 'see', '34', 'Round', 'Midnight', '34', 'best', 'example', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'probably', 'best', 'Dave', 'Robicheaux', 'can', 'expect', 'had', 'hoped', 'more', 'Burke', 'as', 'hard', 'adapt', 'Richard', 'Stark', 'Payback', 'Point', 'Blank', 'Outfit']",N/A
