1615164,A1FX6X2GSARAPB,B00AQVMWD6,Merton Sargent,"[0, 0]",Love the Mrs. Brown's Boys DVDs.  I have bought series one and two and enjoy season three just as much.  I like british comedies on PBS and BBC America but this Irish Comedy is like british comedy on steriods.  The language is adult so not for everyone and not for young children.  You have to buy a multi-region DVD player and a plug adapter to use it in the USA.  For me it was well worth the purchase.,5,old dude,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,404,"['Love', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'Boys', 'DVDs', 'have', 'bought', 'series', 'one', 'two', 'enjoy', 'season', 'three', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'british', 'comedies', 'PBS', 'BBC', 'America', 'Irish', 'Comedy', 'british', 'comedy', 'steriods', 'language', 'adult', 'so', 'not', 'everyone', 'not', 'young', 'children', 'have', 'buy', 'multi-region', 'DVD', 'player', 'plug', 'adapter', 'use', 'USA', 'was', 'well', 'purchase']",N/A
