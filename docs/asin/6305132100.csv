450411,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,6305132100,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[1, 1]","Sliding Doors is the 1998 Gwyneth Paltrow vehicle based on the alternate reality theme originally explored in the 1982 Polish film &quot;Blind Chance&quot; and 1998's Run Lola Run.  After viewing some of Paltrow's lesser works I wasn't expecting much with this one, so it pretty much took me by storm.  Paltrow solidifies herself here as an American honorary Brit and interestingly some not so covert swipes are taken at American culture (John Hannah's references to Seinfeld, Baywatch, David Cassidy, etc.)So Paltrow as Helen just misses the tube...and just makes it, and we see both realities play out with interspersed editing.  Where she misses it we see her life seemingly sliding downhill rapidly, whereas where she makes it apparently on the upswing.  She has a boyfriend in Gerry (John Lynch) who's cheating with an intentionally annoying American (yet another swipe at Americans), but catching the tube allows her to meet James (Hannah) who's Scottish humor is contagious, and find out Gerry.  While missing it she has only suspicions of Gerry while she works 2 jobs to support his non-existent novel writing and snowballing of lies about his fidelity.And there is an interesting double-twist ending which I won't devulge, but suffice it to say both realities intersect in interesting ways and it's hinted at that they have some kind of pull on each other; i.e. her missing the tube one has her imagining and regretting not having a better reality (the catching the tube one).

The other Gwyneth misses the underground, and does not catch her philandering boyfriend in delito fragante; her life will continue for a while on a mediocre path.

450424,A3S87ZOPB3UM9N,6305132100,atmj,"[5, 7]","THE ACTING WAS GREAT, THE STORY A BIT ONE SIDED:Gwyneth Paltrow and Jean Tripplehorn do an excellent job pulling off duel roles for the same character in this romantic/comedy/drama. The leading men are equally charming in both their particular ways. (Tongue in cheek here).  The story line is creative as well, but more could have been done a little less extremely.  The characters are very one-sided and could have been more creatively handled.BASIC IDEA, WE ALL WONDER WHAT IF:How many times do we have an opportunity to have an insignificant event play an important point in our life, that we don't even realize the significance.  This was the fundamental thrust in the movie.  Timing.  What forces out there guide (or not) our lives?  How much is chance and how much is destiny? If you believe the director/writer in this story, only one path works.  This was the part I didn't like.BASIC STORY:Gwyneth Paltrow's character is involved with a two timing boyfriend, who's lack of character and overbearing mistress dominate both their lives.  Due to a minor change in timing one version takes Gwyneth's character out of his life.  In the other scenerio, she falls prey to her unconfirmed doubts.  Both of their lives continue and the story ends at another crossroads.  I can't say more without giving it away.  However, I think the director, could have handled it a bit more creatively and even handedly.DARK VERSUS LIGHT:The comedy is dark in some situations as you see how manipulated and domineered Gwyneth's character becomes by her situation, while remaining in the louse of a boyfriend's life.  Ironically, the darker scenario, her hair is dark.  And the lighter (kind of) scenario, her hair is light. In this situation once she gets on with her life with another man, the comedy is light and whimsical.  A bit too obvious however.  The drudge versus the successful working womanHATED SOME OF THE ENDING:The only major flaw I find in the movie is the ending.  This was a bit too much.  Is this the directors punishment for all the strong determined woman out there, who have dumped their louses?  What were you thinking?  Shame on you.It was an interesting movie that was at time a bit predictable at times but enjoyable none the less.  One wonderfully hysterical part of it was the dialogue between Jerry and his (sympathetic?) mate at the bar.  How many louses expect sympathy for their situation.  This guy was for real.

450438,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,6305132100,Christopher Engel,"[4, 7]","*Author's Note: The slang ""chick"" to refer to a woman is not flattering and is in no way meant to be. I doubt any self-respecting woman wants to be called a ""chick"". Having said that, ""chick flick"" doesn't mean it's a film for women, or insinuate that it's a film only women could enjoy. It's a derogatory word for a shallow, superficial film that caters to a female stereotype, similar in tone to ""a real man's film,"" which would indicate that it's deliberately stupid, i.e. designed to appeal to the idiotic male stereotype; an equally-shallow film meant only to attract the men who would actually use that meaningless term for ""a 'real' man"", which is an intentionally-derogatory term for anything that caters to men who would react unfavorably to being called that. Think of literally any film in which women are portrayed as totally ineffectual or in need of protection by a stronger male, or have no role besides being sex objects--they're impossible to count in modern cinema.*The premise here is sound, even if it's been done before. Yes, two seemingly innocuous events can lead your life in totally different directions--it's not like film designed this trope, it's been a philosophical topic since practically the beginning of time. The magnitude of something seemingly small such as missing a train can change one's entire life. The premise is right there without ambiguity. The execution, unfortunately, makes it little more than a chick flick with unlikable, shallow characters, none of which any half-human person can sympathize with.There are some major problems here that deserve mention. First, it takes its initial scenario way too far. Missing the train alone would be enough, but the filmmakers throw in an attempted mugging and a cheating love interest, meeting a new love interest, along with being fired, all in the same day. Really, they just overdo it, for reasons I don't quite understand, because it's not like anyone's missing the point of the film in the first ten minutes. It's like it wants to drive its own message home with poignancy, but in doing so, turns it into a highly unlikely fictional story that just doesn't often happen in real life. Missing a train might make you fail to meet a love interest...OR catch your lover cheating on you...OR ending up in any number of scenarios. But all of these at once? It's just irritating, and makes the whole thing seem trite. The aura reeks of chick flick status, with an ultra-sappy and saccharine atmosphere that never lets up for a second. It's even sappy by chick flick standards, now that I think on it.If you actually find its artificial meaning poignant, then you've been missing out on what philosophers have been talking about for millennia, or somehow haven't figured it out on your own yet that this kind of thing happens. Yeah, it assumes that life isn't deterministic (in other words, that there is only *one possible path* that could happen), and it doesn't follow a lot of rules of reality that are all hypothetical and largely meaningless and inapplicable to real life. What are you supposed to think by the end? ""Man, if only I'd have had french toast instead of a bagel the day my brother had a car accident, it might not have happened."" Well, sure, in reality, that's not exactly untrue, because it can affect just a few seconds that would cause a split-second event not to happen; no collision, since your brother would be a few seconds later with the french toast. We get it. If you want to repeat this message, this film does a poor job of it, with a saccharine atmosphere and seriously lacking acting jobs, as well as some very serious breaks with reality and extremely unlikely scenarios, even for films with premises like these.It's just not possible to like this film unless you can get over its shallow characters, saccharine atmosphere, sappy writing, less-than-convincing acting, and basically just utter nonsense to follow a premise that could work if done right, which this film fails miserably at. It just doesn't add up, and in this film, the events adding up is the entire point. It takes a basic philosophical concept and manages to critically muck it up into less than what it originally was--not a good thing for the concept.My father actually got this film for free from one of his colleagues that liked it, and because I had heard of it and thought the premise was interesting, I decided to throw it in and watch it once. To say the least, I was horridly disappointed with how the premise was pulled off. The writing is awful, the directing is insensible, and no one seems to be trying too hard to make this into the meaningful film someone might have wanted it to be at one point in time. Somewhere along the line (literally), something went terribly wrong, and this film goes into shallow chick flick territory, really fast. Within minutes, you realize this film has no intention of showing you anything beyond its initial ten-minute message that it plays with. After that, it amounts to a romantic wit-fest that doesn't even measure up to Gilmore Girls standards. It all quickly falls apart, and continues to fall apart with every ""twist"" that seem to make less and less sense as they happen, and each scenario as a result of those doors is just too unlikely, even by the standards of the philosophy itself in the real world, to happen as they do here. The result is disastrous, and self-destructs within minutes of the opening credits, before the ashes blow away as the film unfolds into utter nonsense.Don't bother if you don't like chick flicks. You won't find anything else worthwhile here. If you want to explore the philosophy behind it which is only vaguely touched upon here, look up determinism on Wikipedia, along with all the related philosophies involved. Because the message isn't a new thing, you'd at least expect the film to do it justice. It doesn't, and instead opts to settle for being insultingly shallow and stupid on the level of a sitcom with a poorly-written romance subplot that goes nowhere. If you have the choice behind watching this film or not watching it, let the case remain shut. It's more likely to change your life for the better in the time you're not wasting watching it.",1,"Another sappy, shallow ""chick flick"" trying to act intellectual.",1330041600,"02 24,

Gerry is an awesome character, a totally loathsome whining toad that you just love to hate.The two plot versions run in parallel throughout the movie, but due to different hair styles for Helen it is a simple matter to follow along without getting a migrane.  I must warn you that there is a twist at the end that you may not like as it differs from the usual R Comedy formula.Cast performances are really good, Paltrow does a creditable British accent, which is important to me being a Brit. Hannah is great as always and I thought John Lynch was excellent.The thinking part?

450443,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6305132100,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 5]","Two things are essential if you want to watch this movie.  One, you have to like Gwyneth Paltrow, because you're going to see a lot of her; and two, it helps to be a girl.  Since I only half qualify I am not the best audience for this corny, but clever, three-quarters cute, romantic comedy.  Most of it is standard faire: London girl Helen (Paltrow) has to choose between puppy-eyed loser Gerry (John Lynch) and Good Guy James (John Hannah).  Circumstances make the Good Guy look bad while the puppy-eyed loser pouts real well and looks emotionally helpless, so it's tough on our good girl, who's kind of like a Brit Mary Tyler Moore for the nineties.  But &quot;she's gonna find true love.&quot;  Count on it.  It's just that there's an hour and a half of misdirection before she does.Paltrow isn't able to display anything close to her full range here, even though the film amounts to a vehicle for her.  The clever plot idea is to show her life under one set of circumstances (she misses the train and doesn't meet James) and ""a road not taken"" (she catches the train and does meet James) in alternating cuts.  Surprisingly it works fairly well.  To keep us from getting confused, her hair goes short and blonde in one set and long and dark in the other.  I like her better with dark hair.  She looks more glamorous.  I was surprised to notice that back-to-back adoring reviews on Amazon were written by eleven and twelve-year-old girls.  When I think about it, that's kind of nice, since this is a sweet movie and those tough little critics are an appropriate audience (along with me, I guess), and this is an advisory tale about the nature of men, illustrating that you have to be careful about whom you choose when you're following your heart.Most fun in the movie is the dirty deeds done by Lydia, (Jeanne Tripplehorn) Helen's rival for Gerry.  To humiliate working girl Helen she has her deliver sandwiches and then claims she got food poisoning.  To really trash her, Lydia sends her on a phony job interview at her apartment in time to catch her with weasel-willed Gerry while announcing that she's pregnant by same.  Our girl's knees buckle, but she stands tall through all the heart-break.",4,Do you like your Paltrow with light hair or dark?,974073600,"11 13, 2000",2000,2202,"['Two', 'things', 'are', 'essential', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'One', 'have', 'like', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'lot', 'two', 'be', 'girl', 'only', 'half', 'qualify', 'am', 'not', 'best', 'audience', 'corny', 'clever', 'three-quarters', 'cute', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Most', 'standard', 'faire', 'London', 'girl', 'Helen', 'Paltrow', 'choose', 'puppy-eyed', 'loser', 'Gerry', 'John', 'Lynch', 'Good', 'Guy', 'James', 'John', 'Hannah', 'Circumstances', 'make', 'Good', 'Guy', 'look', 'bad', 'puppy-eyed', 'loser', 'pouts', 'real', 'well', 'emotionally', 'helpless', 'tough', 'good', 'girl', 'who', 'kind', 'Brit', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'nineties', 'quot', 'gon', 'find', 'true', 'love.', 'quot', 'Count', 'just', 'hour', 'half', 'misdirection', 'does.Paltrow', ""n't"", 'able', 'display', 'anything', 'close', 'full', 'range', 'here', 'even', 'film', 'amounts', 'vehicle', 'clever', 'plot', 'idea', 'show', 'life', 'one', 'set', 'circumstances', 'train', ""n't"", 'meet', 'James', 'road', 'not', 'taken', 'train', 'meet', 'James', 'alternating', 'cuts', 'Surprisingly', 'fairly', 'well', 'keep', 'getting', 'confused', 'hair', 'short', 'blonde', 'one', 'set', 'long', 'dark', 'other', 'better', 'dark', 'hair', 'more', 'glamorous', 'was', 'surprised', 'notice', 'back-to-back', 'adoring', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'were', 'written', 'eleven', 'twelve-year-old', 'girls', 'When', 'think', 'kind', 'nice', 'sweet', 'movie', 'tough', 'little', 'critics', 'are', 'appropriate', 'audience', 'guess', 'advisory', 'tale', 'nature', 'men', 'illustrating', 'have', 'be', 'careful', 'whom', 'choose', 'when', ""'re"", 'following', 'heart.Most', 'fun', 'movie', 'dirty', 'deeds', 'done', 'Lydia', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'Helen', 'rival', 'Gerry', 'humiliate', 'working', 'girl', 'Helen', 'deliver', 'sandwiches', 'then', 'got', 'food', 'poisoning', 'really', 'trash', 'Lydia', 'phony', 'job', 'interview', 'apartment', 'time', 'catch', 'weasel-willed', 'Gerry', 'announcing', 'pregnant', 'same', 'girl', 'knees', 'buckle', 'tall', 'heart-break']",N/A

Davies referred to /Turn Left/ as Doctor Who's &#34;Sliding Doors Moment&#34;, I have been curious to see this film. Like the Doctor Who episode, the film takes the premise that a small choice can have big repercussions.Directed and written by Peter Howitt from Bread, the bleachpermed beleathered Joey manages to show that he is capable of more than just a one-note comedy performance. While the scripts seems formulaic at times, it nevertheless has patches of realism, and the characters are made engaging and sympathetic.The story takes off when a PR girl/waitress/sandwich girl played by Gwynneth Paltrow misses a train and a few seconds later we see what would have happened had she not missed that train. For the remainder of the movie, we cut between the two different universes, the one in which she caught the train, and the one where she didn't. The script was allegedly very difficult for Bickley to write, as he had to keep track of two storylines and two plots running in parallel, and he seems to have done a pretty good job with this.Gwyneth Paltrow obligingly has a haircut a short way into the film to allow us to distinguish between the two universes. This is the equivalent of Spock's beard in the Star Trek alternate universe. It would have been nice if the two leading men in the film could have had something more to distinguish them, and John Hannah and John Lynch do look alarmingly similar. Maybe Gwyneth just goes for men with menacing eyebrows.This is a British film with a capital &#34;B&#34; as we have Paltrow playing an English woman (and losing her accent quite successfully), Scots John Hannah (star of the Inspector Rubik detective series), and an Irish best mate. Only the lack of a Welsh person prevents our completing the set. The other American star in the film is Jeanne Tripplehorn (whose name makes me think of a triceratops-shaped Swiss mountain) who plays an American, and was no doubt put in to add transatlantic appeal. There is an otherwise illogical reference to the &#34;Jeopardy&#34; American game show which seems to show that the American market was at the forefront of Howitt's mind when the film was made.Lynch's character Jerry also has a jolly cockney best friend, and the two best friends allow the audience to see into the thoughts of the leading characters. A crude device, but it works really well.The London of the film seems very modern (1998), except that fewer people than in reality have mobile 'phones and people are still using Filofaxes. Still, at least the landline use allows the old &#34;1471&#34; trick to be used. The culture of affluence and waste is depicted very accurately, with people buying ready-made sandwiches and eating out every night of the week and drinking expensive alcohol.At the end of the film, there is a surprising twist as we are treated to a close-up of Paltrow's face and the wig-gauze can clearly be seen. So it wasn't a haircut but a wig all along.In this there are lessons for us all. Don't steal alcohol from work. Don't be unfaithful. If you're seeing someone who is attached, use contraception, use the old &#34;141&#34; trick to prevent their wife/girlfriend finding out who called. And above all, watch out when you cross the road.A satisfying and funny film, well worth watching.",4,Surprisingly good!,1401753600,"06 3, 2014",2014,3305,"['Ever', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'referred', '/Turn', 'Left/', 'Doctor', 'Who', '34', 'Sliding', 'Doors', 'Moment', '34', 'have', 'been', 'curious', 'see', 'film', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'episode', 'film', 'premise', 'small', 'choice', 'can', 'have', 'big', 'repercussions.Directed', 'written', 'Peter', 'Howitt', 'Bread', 'bleachpermed', 'beleathered', 'Joey', 'manages', 'show', 'capable', 'more', 'just', 'one-note', 'comedy', 'performance', 'scripts', 'formulaic', 'times', 'nevertheless', 'patches', 'realism', 'characters', 'are', 'made', 'engaging', 'sympathetic.The', 'story', 'off', 'when', 'PR', 'girl/waitress/sandwich', 'girl', 'played', 'Gwynneth', 'Paltrow', 'train', 'few', 'seconds', 'later', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'had', 'not', 'missed', 'train', 'remainder', 'movie', 'cut', 'two', 'different', 'universes', 'one', 'caught', 'train', 'one', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'script', 'was', 'allegedly', 'very', 'difficult', 'Bickley', 'write', 'had', 'keep', 'track', 'two', 'storylines', 'two', 'plots', 'running', 'parallel', 'have', 'done', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'this.Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'obligingly', 'haircut', 'short', 'way', 'film', 'allow', 'distinguish', 'two', 'universes', 'equivalent', 'Spock', 'beard', 'Star', 'Trek', 'alternate', 'universe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'two', 'leading', 'men', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'more', 'distinguish', 'John', 'Hannah', 'John', 'Lynch', 'do', 'look', 'alarmingly', 'similar', 'Maybe', 'Gwyneth', 'just', 'men', 'menacing', 'eyebrows.This', 'British', 'film', 'capital', '34', 'B', '34', 'have', 'Paltrow', 'playing', 'English', 'woman', 'losing', 'accent', 'quite', 'successfully', 'Scots', 'John', 'Hannah', 'star', 'Inspector', 'Rubik', 'detective', 'series', 'Irish', 'best', 'mate', 'Only', 'lack', 'Welsh', 'person', 'completing', 'set', 'other', 'American', 'star', 'film', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'name', 'think', 'triceratops-shaped', 'Swiss', 'mountain', 'who', 'American', 'was', 'doubt', 'put', 'add', 'transatlantic', 'appeal', 'otherwise', 'illogical', 'reference', '34', 'Jeopardy', '34', 'American', 'game', 'show', 'show', 'American', 'market', 'was', 'forefront', 'Howitt', 'mind', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made.Lynch', 'character', 'Jerry', 'also', 'jolly', 'cockney', 'best', 'friend', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'allow', 'audience', 'see', 'thoughts', 'leading', 'characters', 'crude', 'device', 'really', 'well.The', 'London', 'film', 'very', 'modern', '1998', 'fewer', 'people', 'reality', 'have', 'mobile', ""'phones"", 'people', 'are', 'still', 'using', 'Filofaxes', 'Still', 'least', 'landline', 'use', 'old', '34', '1471', '34', 'trick', 'be', 'used', 'culture', 'affluence', 'waste', 'depicted', 'very', 'accurately', 'people', 'buying', 'ready-made', 'sandwiches', 'eating', 'out', 'night', 'week', 'drinking', 'expensive', 'end', 'film', 'surprising', 'twist', 'are', 'treated', 'close-up', 'Paltrow', 'face', 'wig-gauze', 'can', 'clearly', 'be', 'seen', 'was', ""n't"", 'haircut', 'wig', 'along.In', 'are', 'lessons', 'Do', ""n't"", 'steal', 'alcohol', 'work', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'unfaithful', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'someone', 'who', 'attached', 'use', 'contraception', 'use', 'old', '34', '141', '34', 'trick', 'prevent', 'wife/girlfriend', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'called', 'watch', 'out', 'when', 'cross', 'road.A', 'satisfying', 'funny', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
450446,AJDWUMO2AIUB,6305132100,D. Miller,"[0, 0]","To start with, anyone who hasn't seen this movie or doesn't know the premise, the plot line alone is enough to pique interest.Gwyneth Paltrow plays Helen, a PR specialist who starts off her day by getting canned at her job.  Leaving work, she runs to catch a train which she misses, but here is where it gets interesting.  The scene is split in half and for the rest of the movie you follow two scenarios:  what would have happened if she had caught the train, and what happens because she didn't.It's the classic ""What if?"" that we've all wondered about in our own lives from time to time and indeed this film brings out the best of both worlds.  Another question that it takes a sideways look at is ""Would I have been better off if...?""  And I definitely found myself wondering through the film if Helen really would have had a better life if she had caught that train.  Granted, catching the train opens her up to the extreme emotional horror of walking in on her boyfriend in bed with another woman...missing the train spares her that, but which is really the better way to go?  Or maybe everything really does happen for a reason...Paltrow gives a superb performance in each scenario (the two are really quite different due to the drastic events).  Her English accent is charming as always.  Jeanne Tripplehorn (`Til There Was You, The Firm, Waterworld) plays Lydia, the former girlfriend of Helen's all-too-adulterous boyfriend, Gerry.  Truthfully, I thought Tripplehorn did a better-than-average job.  From the past roles I've seen her in, I don't think I expected her to be able to pull off such a witchy part so well.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Another face I was surprised to see was John Hannah (Four Weddings and a Funeral) who plays James, a great-once-you-get-to-know-him character, and Hannah fits it well.  Part of what I enjoyed about watching this film was that Paltrow and Tripplehorn aside, there weren't really any faces or names that I recognized...the plot, directing, and acting carry this film rather than big names and faces.

Movahedpour ""doeadear""","[2, 2]","I truly enjoyed this sweet and unique film from Britain.It is a charming and thoughtful portrayal of a young woman named Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow)who is fired from her job, and finds parallel destiny in the doors of a subway train. It is a story of destiny, and how we can never truly escape what we are meant to do, even if we are going in completely opposite directions.In one version, Helen misses the train, is mugged, goes home to her boyfriend Gerry (John Lynch) who has just finished an afternoon delight with his ex-girlfriend Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn). She then begins a series of menial jobs, unaware that her boyfriend is cheating on her. In the version where she makes the train, she meets the charming James (John Hannah) and returns home to find her boyfriend in the throes of passion with Lydia. She leaves him, moves in with her best friend, starts her own business, and begins a loving relationship with James. We see these two versions, and think we know which direction they are going...but it's destiny, after all, and nothing is quite that simple.Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderful as usual, doing her British accent in between 'Emma' and &quot;Viola&quot;. Her eyes become big as saucers when she is hurt, and she can express more emotion in a twitch of her face than many actresses can with their whole bodies. John Hannah is wonderful as James, the charming, kind, sweet man of most women's dreams, but still with his faults. I wish John Hannah, and this film for that matter, were more successful. I had never watched the film before, I had neglected to rent it many times, because I wasn't completely &quot;aware&quot; of the film. I regret not seeing it sooner.

The Helen with the knowledge of infidelity leaves her cheating boyfriend and finds a rebound guy (John Hannah) to replace him.This rebound relationship is supposed to be perceived as being much healthier than her previous relationship, but I saw them as the same.  Both men lie to Helen and both do so with the belief that lying is a justifiable means to an end.Also, there's a serious hole in this rebound man's story (when he's caught lying) that any sophisticated woman would be wary of, but Helen just accepts his story with hugs and kisses.So, in the end, has Helen really learned her lesson?  I don't think so.Nonetheless, this was a compelling movie to watch.  I found it interesting that even though you have two different stories taking place, you still have the same Helen, with the same hopes and dreams, in both.  So like twins separated at birth, these two Helens wind up chasing after the same dreams despite their very different circumstances.In case you're wondering if you'll be able to tell the two Helens apart, you will because one of the Helens cuts her hair very short and dyes it blonde.Also, instead of showing both stories simultaneously (like splitting the screen in half and showing both stories side-by-side), the stories are blended together instead.For example, there's one scene where both Helens are in the same restaurant, but they're shown sitting at opposite sides of the room...and they're there for different reasons, too.I enjoyed the dry, British humor but not so much the acting.  I wasn't expecting Gwyneth Paltrow to use a British accent, so when she did, I kind of cringed.  Also, I thought her acting came out flat sometimes.For instance, in the scene where she walks in on her boyfriend in bed with another, I expected shock or fury or something, but she just stands there looking bored.  Eventually, she starts hitting him, but it felt like she just did that because the script asked her to.John Hannah (the rebound guy) does a decent acting job, however, his thick Irish/Scottish accent made him difficult to understand at times.John Lynch (the cheating boyfriend) overacts in this movie to the point where it would be obvious to anyone that he's up to no good.Jeanne Tripplehorn, however, gave a good performance as his demanding mistress.This movie is clever in how it seamlessly blends these two stories together (especially the ending), but suffered from mediocre acting and an ending that makes it questionable if Helen's really learned her lesson.",3,"In the end, has Helen really learned her lesson?",1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,2896,"['movie', 'two', 'parallel', 'stories', 'One', 'story', 'Helen', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'catching', 'subway', 'home', 'catching', 'boyfriend', 'John', 'Lynch', 'bed', 'mistress', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'other', 'story', 'shows', 'Helen', 'missing', 'subway', 'coming', 'home', 'mistress', 'already', 'left.The', 'decisions', 'Helen', 'next', 'are', 'based', 'how', 'much', 'knowledge', 'cheating', 'boyfriend', 'Helen', 'knowledge', 'infidelity', 'cheating', 'boyfriend', 'rebound', 'guy', 'John', 'Hannah', 'replace', 'him.This', 'rebound', 'relationship', 'supposed', 'be', 'perceived', 'being', 'much', 'healthier', 'previous', 'relationship', 'saw', 'same', 'men', 'lie', 'Helen', 'do', 'so', 'belief', 'lying', 'justifiable', 'means', 'end.Also', 'serious', 'hole', 'rebound', 'man', 'story', 'when', 'caught', 'lying', 'sophisticated', 'woman', 'would', 'be', 'wary', 'Helen', 'just', 'story', 'hugs', 'kisses.So', 'end', 'Helen', 'really', 'learned', 'lesson', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.Nonetheless', 'was', 'compelling', 'movie', 'watch', 'found', 'interesting', 'even', 'have', 'two', 'different', 'stories', 'taking', 'place', 'still', 'have', 'same', 'Helen', 'same', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'twins', 'separated', 'birth', 'two', 'Helens', 'wind', 'up', 'chasing', 'same', 'dreams', 'very', 'different', 'circumstances.In', 'case', ""'re"", 'wondering', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'two', 'Helens', 'apart', 'will', 'because', 'one', 'Helens', 'hair', 'very', 'short', 'dyes', 'blonde.Also', 'instead', 'showing', 'stories', 'simultaneously', 'splitting', 'screen', 'half', 'showing', 'stories', 'side-by-side', 'stories', 'are', 'blended', 'together', 'instead.For', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Helens', 'are', 'same', 'restaurant', ""'re"", 'shown', 'sitting', 'opposite', 'sides', 'room', ""'re"", 'different', 'reasons', 'enjoyed', 'dry', 'British', 'humor', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'use', 'British', 'accent', 'so', 'when', 'did', 'kind', 'cringed', 'Also', 'thought', 'acting', 'came', 'out', 'flat', 'sometimes.For', 'instance', 'scene', 'where', 'boyfriend', 'bed', 'expected', 'shock', 'fury', 'something', 'just', 'looking', 'bored', 'Eventually', 'hitting', 'felt', 'just', 'did', 'script', 'asked', 'to.John', 'Hannah', 'rebound', 'guy', 'decent', 'acting', 'job', 'however', 'thick', 'Irish/Scottish', 'accent', 'made', 'difficult', 'understand', 'times.John', 'Lynch', 'cheating', 'boyfriend', 'movie', 'point', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'up', 'good.Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'however', 'gave', 'good', 'performance', 'demanding', 'mistress.This', 'movie', 'clever', 'how', 'seamlessly', 'two', 'stories', 'together', 'especially', 'ending', 'suffered', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'ending', 'questionable', 'Helen', 'really', 'learned', 'lesson']",N/A

I know it did me.  I won't rehash the plot again, except to say that the &quot;What if I had ONLY caught that train?&quot; scenario is something we've all experienced and wondered about at one point or another.  London career gal Helen gets to experience both possibilities, with hilarious and touching results.  Ms. Paltrow turns in a winning, subtly nuanced performance in her dual role as Helen-Who-Makes-the-Train, and Helen-Who-Doesn't, making herself likeable enough in both scenarios that we root for her in both 'lives'.  Despite some lapses into superficiality, the script keeps us guessing how things will turn out for Helen--in fact, what appears to be the 'ideal' scenario at first is shown to be not so ideal at all.Two things make this movie worth viewing a second time--the glimpse it provides into the lives of contemporary London 'singletons', which is always intriging to this Anglophile, and John Hannah in the role of James, Helen's love interest in her 'alternative' universe.  First encountered by Helen, and the audience as a persistently chatty fellow passenger on the Tube, he quickly wins Helen's heart, and the audience's with his warm and endearing teddy-bearish decency, his quirky and appealing looks, and The Accent, a Scottish brogue so thick as to be nearly impenetrable at first to Yank ears, but which soon becomes addictive.  'Sliding Doors' is just that much better when Hannah is on-screen, and he and Paltrow make an appealing, if unlikely couple--the Golden Hollywood It-Girl paired with a clownishly attractive regular Joe.  The same formula was used in 'Notting Hill', but unlike the sterile screen pairing of Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant in that film, Paltrow and Hannah do achieve a real, quirky chemistry together that makes the romance believable.Fans of &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; will recognize Hannah--he gives a charmingly different performance here as a romantic leading man.

It is obvious that the British have inherited a lot from their dear Shakespeare. What's more it takes a basket of Britishers to contemplate this sentimental imbroglio of a woman and a man breaking up because of the man's infedility and his inability to assume his second passion from a pure woman's point of view without turning the film into some vengeful proclamation against the sexist nature of the world enslaved by men, the male chauvinistic pigs of today and the fried bacon of tomorrow. And with this light comedy we avoid both the pigs and the bacon. So we get some rather entertaining comedy with a moral : it is up to women to assume their freedom and just grasp it in their own minds for it to become graspable in real life. Slavery is in the mind. The film decides to demultiply the poor girl into at least two beings if not three or four to show how everything revolves around the women's ability to catch an opportunity to be free and to pursue it to its end. Life is a succession of sliding doors in lifts, underground trains and tubes, in the lobby of so many business buildings that you have to learn how to go through them without banging into them or getting squeezed, squelched, squirted and squished between the two sliding leaves, or shouldn't I say leafs, of the door. And here the woman, maybe the women, are becoming pedagogical and exemplary to men and the way one is laminated into oblivion and non-existence, and the other is severely castigated and even slightly whipped into telling the truth. Brilliant in a way even if it is not Romeo and Juliet, but it is definitely better than all the Pretty Women we may have seen and met here and there on some silvery screen.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",5,Brilliant Britishers in comedy garb,1163548800,"11 15, 2006",2006,1948,"['bunch', 'Britishers', 'introduce', 'very', 'black', 'very', 'funny', 'humour', 'love', 'imbroglio', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'schmaltzy', 'sentimentalese', 'obvious', 'British', 'have', 'inherited', 'lot', 'dear', 'Shakespeare', 'What', 'more', 'basket', 'Britishers', 'contemplate', 'sentimental', 'imbroglio', 'woman', 'man', 'breaking', 'up', 'man', 'infedility', 'inability', 'assume', 'second', 'passion', 'pure', 'woman', 'point', 'view', 'turning', 'film', 'vengeful', 'proclamation', 'sexist', 'nature', 'world', 'enslaved', 'men', 'male', 'chauvinistic', 'pigs', 'today', 'fried', 'bacon', 'tomorrow', 'light', 'comedy', 'avoid', 'pigs', 'bacon', 'get', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'comedy', 'moral', 'women', 'assume', 'freedom', 'just', 'grasp', 'own', 'minds', 'become', 'graspable', 'real', 'life', 'Slavery', 'mind', 'film', 'demultiply', 'poor', 'girl', 'least', 'two', 'beings', 'not', 'three', 'four', 'show', 'how', 'everything', 'women', 'ability', 'catch', 'opportunity', 'be', 'free', 'pursue', 'end', 'Life', 'succession', 'sliding', 'doors', 'lifts', 'underground', 'trains', 'tubes', 'lobby', 'so', 'many', 'business', 'buildings', 'have', 'learn', 'how', 'go', 'banging', 'getting', 'squeezed', 'squelched', 'squirted', 'squished', 'two', 'sliding', 'leaves', 'should', ""n't"", 'say', 'leafs', 'door', 'here', 'woman', 'maybe', 'women', 'are', 'becoming', 'pedagogical', 'exemplary', 'men', 'way', 'one', 'laminated', 'oblivion', 'non-existence', 'other', 'severely', 'castigated', 'even', 'slightly', 'whipped', 'telling', 'truth', 'Brilliant', 'way', 'even', 'not', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'definitely', 'better', 'Pretty', 'Women', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'met', 'here', 'there', 'silvery', 'screen.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne']",N/A

Paltrow plays Helen, depressed because she's just been fired from her job, heading into the Underground in London to get the train home. She may or may not make her train, depending on whether or not a toddler gets in her way as she's dashing down the stairs. If she makes the train, she'll be just in time to catch her cheating boyfriend in the act and she'll dump the creep once and for all. If she doesn't, he's off the hook and he'll keep on stringing her along.&quot;Sliding Doors&quot; plays both sides of the story; we see Helen walking in on her boyfriend and his other woman in her own bed; ditching him and the wretched life she leads with him, finding a new job as a publicist and a new love in James, a handsome young man with a secret of his own. Again, we see Helen missing the train, coming home minutes after her boyfriend has gotten his &quot;other&quot; safely out of the flat he shares with Helen (and which, incidentally, Helen is paying the rent on), and continuing her drab &quot;plain Jane&quot; existence working part-time in a sandwich shop. Not until near the movie's end do we find out if Helen missed her train or not.Paltrow is excellent as both halves of Helen, and John Hannah is very good as James. I especially liked Jeanne Tripplehorn as the other woman, Lydia, lonely and vulnerable under all her pseudo-sophistication, who finally takes matters into her own hands when Gerry refuses to fall off either side of the fence.  But the big laugh in this film is John Lynch as Gerry, the no-good louse who cheats on Helen and Lydia while he lives off both of them. Gerry is such a whining creep that his best friend laughs in his face as he relates his tale of woe; he wants it both ways and the world is unfair because he can't have his cake and eat it too.  All we can do is wonder what in the world Helen and Lydia see in this loser. The film ends pretty much predictably but it's fun to watch.

450491,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6305132100,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[91, 101]","I actually passed on seeing &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; several years ago because of a review I read by Roger Ebert. I knew about the basic premise of the film, which is that a character played by Gwyneth Paltrow gets on a subway train and does not get on a subway train. The film goes back and forth between the two plotlines, basically playing out both sides of Robert Frost's two paths diverging in the woods. Ebert's complaint was that taken independently neither of the plotlines was worth watching, which was enough to convince me to see something else.Well, now I have seen &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; and while I agree with Ebert's critique, I want to argue that what is interesting about this film is not the two plotlines but the way they interact. Think of it as two wrongs making a right or the total effect being greater than the sum of the two parts or whatever makes sense to you. Writer-director Peter Howitt makes &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; into more than just a gimmick film. It is not in the class of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; or &quot;Memento,&quot; but it is certainly on a level with &quot;50 First Dates.&quot;Paltrow plays Helen Quilley. One morning she goes off to work, leaving behind her lover, Gerry (John Lynch). As soon as she gets to work she is sacked. On the way home she both catches and misses the subway in a sequences that is rather clumsily staged, but you get the idea. The Helen on the subway gets home in time to catch Gerry in bed with his supposedly ex-lover, Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn). The Helen who misses the subway gets hurt when her purse is stolen and gets home after Lydia has left and therefore knows nothing about the affair.Because of the near mugging Howitt is able to have one Helen look different from the other because of a bandage on her head after the hospital visit. By the time that heals the other Helen, trying to put Gerry behind her, has shortened her hair and bleached in blonde. The other key distinction is that while one Helen is still with Gerry, working two jobs in order to support him while he (does not) write a novel (and does continue to see Lydia), the other is seeing James (John Hannah), a nice man she met on the subway home and who believes the Monty Python line &quot;Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition&quot; helps to put life in perspective (which is certainly true).It seems fairly obvious that both Helens should be with James and leave Gerry far behind, but it seems clear that Howitt is going to work the irony angles as much as possible in this film. It is not so much that these are parallel stories as their are recurring elements of symmetry and at some point I decided that what was going to happen here was that Howitt was going to be able to have his cake and eat it two. This indeed turns out to be the case, but telling you that does not give away the end game.Paltrow is fine in the main role, although why the two main female characters had to be played by American actresses is beyond me. Tripplehorn's character is in the &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; mold, which makes Gerry's inability to choose between Helen and Lydia rather laughable, a fact repeatedly pointed out to him by his friend, Russell (Douglas McFerran) at the bar. Russell has the best lines in the film, calling Gerry &quot;a morality-free zone&quot; and pointing out that his advice will be unappreciated since it is based in reality. Lynch manages to play Gerry so that there is some hope of redemption and we remain open to the idea that things could work out between him and Helen, while we wait for Helen to catch up with our feelings for Hannah's character, who is likeable in a rather surprisingly unpretentious way for such a gabby guy.This is not a brilliant and creative film, but Howitt constructs what I think is a smart story line bouncing back and forth between the lives of the two Helens. There is no profound point to be made in the end beyond the ancient idea that when it comes to the lives of human beings and their attempts to find love in the world the gods tend to look down and laugh. But in a world where so many films are exercises in stupidity and I find myself thinking that what ended up on screen was a first draft that needed some serious work, &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; has all the pieces fit. The other film I have seen by Howitt, &quot;Antitrust,&quot; was also smartly crafted, although in that one somebody else wrote the script. Still, that is not a bad pair of films for viewers who like to have their brains engaged.",4,Peter Howitt's debut film about two divergent life paths,1091059200,"07 29, 2004",2004,4521,"['actually', 'passed', 'seeing', 'quot', 'Sliding', 'Doors', 'quot', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'review', 'read', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'knew', 'basic', 'premise', 'film', 'character', 'played', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'subway', 'train', 'not', 'get', 'subway', 'train', 'film', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'plotlines', 'basically', 'playing', 'out', 'sides', 'Robert', 'Frost', 'two', 'paths', 'diverging', 'woods', 'Ebert', 'complaint', 'was', 'taken', 'independently', 'plotlines', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'was', 'enough', 'convince', 'see', 'something', 'else.Well', 'now', 'have', 'seen', 'quot', 'Sliding', 'Doors', 'quot', 'agree', 'Ebert', 'critique', 'want', 'argue', 'what', 'interesting', 'film', 'not', 'two', 'plotlines', 'way', 'interact', 'Think', 'two', 'wrongs', 'making', 'right', 'total', 'effect', 'being', 'greater', 'sum', 'two', 'parts', 'sense', 'Writer-director', 'Peter', 'Howitt', 'quot', 'Sliding', 'Doors', 'quot', 'more', 'just', 'gimmick', 'film', 'not', 'class', 'quot', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'quot', 'quot', 'Memento', 'quot', 'certainly', 'level', 'quot', '50', 'First', 'Dates.', 'quot', 'Paltrow', 'Helen', 'Quilley', 'One', 'morning', 'work', 'leaving', 'lover', 'Gerry', 'John', 'Lynch', 'As', 'soon', 'work', 'sacked', 'way', 'home', 'catches', 'subway', 'sequences', 'rather', 'clumsily', 'staged', 'get', 'idea', 'Helen', 'subway', 'home', 'time', 'catch', 'Gerry', 'bed', 'supposedly', 'ex-lover', 'Lydia', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'Helen', 'who', 'subway', 'hurt', 'when', 'purse', 'stolen', 'home', 'Lydia', 'left', 'therefore', 'knows', 'nothing', 'affair.Because', 'near', 'mugging', 'Howitt', 'able', 'have', 'one', 'Helen', 'look', 'different', 'other', 'bandage', 'head', 'hospital', 'visit', 'time', 'other', 'Helen', 'trying', 'put', 'Gerry', 'shortened', 'hair', 'bleached', 'blonde', 'other', 'key', 'distinction', 'one', 'Helen', 'still', 'Gerry', 'working', 'two', 'jobs', 'order', 'support', 'not', 'write', 'novel', 'continue', 'see', 'Lydia', 'other', 'seeing', 'James', 'John', 'Hannah', 'nice', 'man', 'met', 'subway', 'home', 'who', 'Monty', 'Python', 'line', 'quot', 'Nobody', 'Spanish', 'Inquisition', 'quot', 'put', 'life', 'perspective', 'certainly', 'true', '.It', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'Helens', 'should', 'be', 'James', 'leave', 'Gerry', 'far', 'clear', 'Howitt', 'going', 'work', 'irony', 'angles', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'parallel', 'stories', 'are', 'recurring', 'elements', 'symmetry', 'point', 'decided', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'here', 'was', 'Howitt', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'cake', 'eat', 'two', 'indeed', 'out', 'be', 'case', 'telling', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'end', 'game.Paltrow', 'fine', 'main', 'role', 'why', 'two', 'main', 'female', 'characters', 'had', 'be', 'played', 'American', 'actresses', 'Tripplehorn', 'character', 'quot', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'quot', 'mold', 'Gerry', 'inability', 'choose', 'Helen', 'Lydia', 'rather', 'laughable', 'fact', 'repeatedly', 'pointed', 'out', 'friend', 'Russell', 'Douglas', 'McFerran', 'bar', 'Russell', 'best', 'lines', 'film', 'calling', 'Gerry', 'quot', 'morality-free', 'zone', 'quot', 'pointing', 'out', 'advice', 'will', 'be', 'unappreciated', 'based', 'reality', 'Lynch', 'play', 'Gerry', 'hope', 'redemption', 'remain', 'open', 'idea', 'things', 'could', 'work', 'out', 'Helen', 'wait', 'Helen', 'catch', 'up', 'feelings', 'Hannah', 'character', 'who', 'likeable', 'rather', 'surprisingly', 'unpretentious', 'way', 'gabby', 'guy.This', 'not', 'brilliant', 'creative', 'film', 'Howitt', 'what', 'think', 'smart', 'story', 'line', 'bouncing', 'back', 'forth', 'lives', 'two', 'Helens', 'profound', 'point', 'be', 'made', 'end', 'ancient', 'idea', 'when', 'lives', 'human', 'beings', 'attempts', 'find', 'love', 'world', 'gods', 'tend', 'look', 'down', 'laugh', 'world', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'are', 'exercises', 'stupidity', 'find', 'thinking', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'screen', 'was', 'first', 'draft', 'needed', 'serious', 'work', 'quot', 'Sliding', 'Doors', 'quot', 'pieces', 'fit', 'other', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'Howitt', 'quot', 'Antitrust', 'quot', 'was', 'also', 'smartly', 'crafted', 'one', 'somebody', 'else', 'wrote', 'script', 'Still', 'not', 'bad', 'pair', 'films', 'viewers', 'who', 'like', 'have', 'brains', 'engaged']",N/A

I know, I know, some people read philosophy or go to therapy.  Me, I watch Sliding Doors.  It's like curling up with tea and a blanket on a cold rainy day.  It's a good ""comfort"" movie.Helen (Paltrow) catches a train, comes home and finds her boyfriend in bed with Lydia (Tripplehorn, who is excellent in this).  Or, she misses the train and doesn't find out.  The movie shows us both scenarios.What's  interesting to me is that I can find sympathy for all the main characters.  Obviously we're supposed to sympathize with Paltrow, but it seems like the director made an effort for us to feel for everyone.  Though there's a lot to dislike about Jerry (her old boyfriend), he does seem caught between the two women (there's a scene with his mate in the bar where his friend says, ""you've told me you're not cut out for infidelity and you wish you hadn't started up again with Lydia,"").  He seems trapped by indecision.  And Tripplehorn, while totally over the top (and more than a little crazy in her actions), really wants Jerry to commit to her.  She seems more frustrated than anything else, and keeps trying to push him to make a decision.  But the movie is absolutely stolen by John Hannah, who plays Paltrow's new love interest.

450503,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,6305132100,Marc Cabir Davis,"[4, 5]","Gwyneth Paltrow has long been one of the few American actresses who can perfectly mimic the British accent. We saw this in `Emma', and we now witness her excelling at this particular talent in `Sliding Doors', one of the most thoughtful English films to come out in the last decade. I first saw this film a few years ago upon initial release, and was both impressed and intrigued by the director's style of film-making. Rarely have there been good films that weave alternating storylines convincingly, and to do it when the characters in both storylines are the same person must have been a task indeed. But on every imaginable level, `Sliding Doors' is a respectable success, moderately successful in some areas and hugely in others.Much of this is due to the presence of Gwyneth Paltrow and John Hannah. I have never really liked Gwyneth in her screen performances (I thought her Oscar should have actually gone to Cate Blanchett), but she managed to endear herself to me in this movie. This is due to the intelligent script and the quaint London setting, I suppose, but is also owed to Gwyneth's smouldering chemistry with the lead actor (little known John Hannah, who was also the gay lover in `Four Weddings and a Funeral'). He has always been a rather reclusive actor and this film remains his only real foray into mainstream cinema as a leading man (he did play Rachel Weisz's brother in `The Mummy' but no one remembered his role there).The story is simple enough. Gwyneth lives with her aspiring writer boyfriend in a downtown apartment. Unbeknowest to her, he is having an affair with an American executive who works in England (played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, who gets all the bitchy lines). One day, after being fired from her job, Gwyn returns home through the metro rail network. The story splits in two here. On one hand we learn of Gwyn's life if she catches the train on time and therefore reaches home in time to find her cheating man in bed with someone else. And on the other, the story deals with what happens if she didn't catch the train and thus reached home late, completely ignorant that her boyfriend's lover has managed to leave before her arrival. This is all brilliant fun, but also soaked in spiritual tones that never get too preachy or boring. A film like this can only work if the leads are convinced of the storyline and the characters they are playing. On those counts, `Sliding Doors' is a resounding success.I particularly liked the way everything came together in the end. Perhaps the message was that you can't cheat destiny or escape from what will eventually happen to you. Luckily for us, the film also suggests that everything that happens to you is good and should be welcomed. I thought this was masterfully brought across. On VHS, this film looks dull as the colors sometimes blend into one another and the sound isn't exactly praiseworthy. Still, it's a worthy buy, as this is the best of British cinema, and is one of those rare gems that don't come by that often.

It's the same when I watch the Mummy movies.Gwyneth is great in this, although shockingly skinny, and she's perfected the English accent (now try a Scottish one dear), which is probably the reason why she's been in quite a few similar movies. (Shakespeare In Love, Emma) It's faultless, although at some points, it does appear as if she's speaking slower, just to make sure she gets it right.The only quibble I have about this movie is the timeline, everything seems to happen really quickly. It can get quite confusing some points. When James & Helen have a milkshake together, he asks her to go to a boat race two weeks on Saturday. Then between the milkshake, and the boat race, he asks to go to dinner with him tonight. Then he encourages her to start her own business, then following the boat race, she offers with that guy's restaurant opening in 6 days, and her business seems to be well on its way. It seems like only a month if that has passed between the milkshake and the opening of the restaurant. Then Gerry phones, and Helen tells her friend that two months ago she wanted to Gerry to show up, and it was James, and now she wants James to phone and Gerry phones. And don't even get me started on the pregnancy thing. It seems like only a wee while passes since she & James sleep together, to her realising her period is late, and doing x amount of pregnancy tests. The pregnancy thing seems to be worst in the timeline aspect of things - it just doesn't seem possible. It would be nice to have a commentary on the DVD (rather than none at all), with the director, to see whether he/she made a balls up with the editing, and really, more time has passed than we're shown.I really didn't like Jeanne Tripplehorn's character in this, until you walked out on Gerry towards the end. I know it's a really nasty thing to say, but in the first shot of her in this, she looks really masculine! I remember the first time I ever saw this, thinking she had a five o'clock shadow, and it still gives me the creeps seeing it now. I don't know whether it's the angle of the shot or what, but she does NOT look feminine at all - yet she does in the rest of the movie. Sometimes I think it's her eyebrows. Am I the only one that's noticed this?This is a great twist on the rom-com fairytale, and really interesting too. But not the least bit confusing as some reviewers have mentioned. I do admit to having a preference to Gwynnie with the longer hair, the short blonde haircut is just a bit too harsh for my liking.

What determines your future: random quirks of fate or the decisions you make?  Sliding Doors explores these possibilities by following two branching paths, one where Helen Quilley (Gwyneth Paltrow) discovers her ex is cheating on her and one where she doesn't.  The divergence between the two realities, accompanied by an audio cue of tinkling chimes, pivots on whether or not she catches a train.There's a reason Helen's returning home early; she's been fired from her ""PR job.""  I put that phrase in air quotes because director Peter Howitt hasn't the slight clue what a PR person actually does.  You see, Helen is an attractive, aloof, hard-drinking gal who supports her live-in boyfriend Gerry (John Lynch) while he writes a book.  She has no contacts to speak of -- after being fired she can't find another ""PR job"" - and has no family of consequence.  We know this because she relies exclusively on her best friend Anna (Zara Turner) when she moves out of her apartment. Even when she's in the hospital no family visits her.  Helen is a cypher, a walking piece of cardboard with a British accent.Her long-suffering boyfriend is so unctuous and passive that he's practically bullied into having an affair with Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn).  Lydia, the other woman, is a raving, sadistic psychopath who isn't above openly taunting her unaware rival for Gerry's affections, which sets off another series of mincing, stuttering dialogues from Gerry. Also, her idea of foreplay is spitting brandy into her boyfriend's mouth. About the only character that reacts appropriately is Gerry's best friend Russell (Douglas McFerran), who finds his life choices hilarious.The other reality turns out a bit better because Helen launches her own PR firm, which consists almost entirely of throwing parties.  She keeps bumping into James (John Hannah), a Scottish bloke that has ""a sense of humor"":  He quotes Monty Python by shouting ""Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!"" even though it's never actually relevant to the conversation.Sliding Doors concludes with, in no particular order, an elderly mother, a restaurant opening, a tearful argument in the rain, a horrible accident, a surprising revelation, and nurses who freely give out information to anybody who asks even if they're not blood relatives.And that's the sum of it: Gwyneth Paltrow with a fake British accent in fake relationships generating fake angst.

Fowler ""ben1283""","[3, 4]","This sweet-natured romantic comedy may be little else but it's got several key ingredients that make it definitely worth a look.  The neat little story has Helen's life split in two, one where she catches the train and gets home to find her boyfriend having an affair, the other where she misses it and continues living with him.Gwyneth Paltrow has never been so endearing (and no-one has ever pulled off a British accent so convincingly), and knows how to play the audience well as we're rooting for her from the very beginning.  She's downtrodden yet resourceful as we see in the two plots.  The slapstick comedy from her husband as he's desperate to keep the affair secret maintains a light air despite more complicated issues that arrive with Helen.  Whilst in the other story Helen meets a nice Irish bloke (Nesbitt), has a new haircut and is generally happy.  Okay, so this isn't anything new but the director manages to run the two stories alongside each other effortlessly and it's so cutely funny that it's hard not to be taken in, especially when all the romantic plots are underlined with an essential humour.

Here's the deal: Gwyneth Paltrow experiences 2 possible outcomes as a result of her attempt to catch a train (the Tube; it's London) home. In one, she catches the train, arrives home hours early, and discovers her live-in boyfriend in bed with another woman. In the 2nd scenario, she misses the train, arrives home a bit later, and finds her boyfriend in the shower but a few things are awry that arouse her suspicion.Really promising idea, and the film carries them both all the way to the conclusion and manages to meld them nicely at the end.The only glitch - well, there were 2, actually - for me was that I had trouble visualizing Paltrow's character seriously falling for the total schmuck/cad/cheating boyfriend and being so undone when the romance faltered. And the other was about an accident scene that occurs very close to the end. It was all filmed so quickly with the 2 scenes occurring simultaneously that just 10 minutes after the film ended, I couldn't remember exactly what had happened in which version.However, that's minor. It's definitely worth watching.

But for some reason I always answer Sliding Doors. It is just so different than any other movie out there and it leaves a lasting impression. It has a Woody Allen feel to it, even if it is set in the UK.The plot-here goes. Our main character,Helen played by Paltrow, is a boring British girl who has a lazy boyfriend and is two timing her with a very cranky lady played by Jeanne Tripplehorn. Well one day Helen has a very bad day at work and rushes to catch the train. The movie then explores 2 very different paths, one where she catches the train and other having missed the train.What happens is pure delight.Her world launches into complete opposities of eachother just by the fact of getting home at a certain time. The movie follows the same women on 2 different roads and all comes down to one of the biggest climaxes you can get. Easily watchable again and again.It really pays homage to thoes who take a chance on life and aren't affraid to realize that they are worth it. Great supporting cast and a good soundtrack. I mean-look at the cover of the dvd itself- one girl has long hair, the other short and stylish. You know it has to be a ride when even her appearance has changed.You may need to be a fan of Gwyneth to really enjoy this movie, also factor in a love of English accents too.

It has a few humorous lines, but no where near slap-stick. It has an interesting plot. If she catches the train her life goes this way, if she misses the train her life goes another way.Paltrow is not the best actress out there and is not the absolute prettiest, but she is also not the worst nor ugliest. Her accent in the movie isn't the best, but not the worst fake accent (dialect) I've ever heard in movies. The characters are believable. The whole day that could change everything is a very bad day for her, but the bad day scenario is not overdone (I've had worst days with several bad events - one after another).I like John Hannah, and I like his character. Once again, he's not the hottest actor, but not the ugliest. He is a pretty good actor and comical.I think too many people get caught up in the shallowness of Hollywood. I love British and Australian movies because the characters are usually believable, not perfect, photo-shopped, airbrushed clones.

In one story, Helen catches the train and arrives home to find her live-in, unemployed, writer boyfriend, Gerry (John Lynch) in bed with his ex-girlfriend Lydia, played by Jeanne Tripplehorn. In the other story, Helen misses the train and arrives back home well after Lydia has left.Though film critic Roger Ebert thought neither story was strong enough by itself to capture the viewer's attention, this observation, while possibly true, is irrelevant.  This film is two part: what happens when you don't find out about a boyfriend's infidelity and what can happen when you do.To easily distinguish between the two Helens, Paltrow's appearance is radically altered.  The Helen who doesn't realize her boyfriend is a cheat keeps her brown hair long and mopes around as a lunch delivery girl, wondering why her boyfriend acts so indifferently toward her.  The other Helen, dramatically lightens and cuts her hair into a pixie, meets a charming single man played by John Hannah and embarks on a career as a freelance event publicist.Without destroying the plot, I will say SLIDING DOORS is the perfect prescription for anyone woman who has a recently gone through a bad break-up.  Proving that living well is the best revenge, SLIDING DOORS is a great choice for a quiet night at home - either alone or with a group of women friends.  But I wonder what the average guy would think of this film.  I would imagine he would feel uncomfortable watching cheater boyfriend Gerry lie his head off and blame Helen when she wonders aloud why their relationship appears to have changed.-- Regina McMenamin",5,A PRESCRIPTION FOR GETTING OVER A BAD BREAK-UP,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,1965,"['recommended', 'film', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'gone', 'bad', 'break-up', 'SLIDING', 'DOORS', 'living', 'well', 'best', 'revenge', 'tale', 'two', 'Helens', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'London', 'publicist', 'who', 'film', 'fired', 'job', 'heads', 'train', 'back', 'home.At', 'point', 'film', 'two', 'stories', 'are', 'simultaneously', 'explored', 'writer/director', 'Peter', 'Howitt', 'one', 'story', 'Helen', 'train', 'home', 'find', 'live-in', 'unemployed', 'writer', 'boyfriend', 'Gerry', 'John', 'Lynch', 'bed', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Lydia', 'played', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'other', 'story', 'Helen', 'train', 'back', 'home', 'well', 'Lydia', 'left.Though', 'film', 'critic', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'thought', 'neither', 'story', 'was', 'strong', 'enough', 'capture', 'viewer', 'attention', 'observation', 'possibly', 'true', 'irrelevant', 'film', 'two', 'part', 'what', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'boyfriend', 'infidelity', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'do.To', 'easily', 'distinguish', 'two', 'Helens', 'Paltrow', 'appearance', 'radically', 'altered', 'Helen', 'who', ""n't"", 'realize', 'boyfriend', 'cheat', 'brown', 'hair', 'long', 'around', 'lunch', 'delivery', 'girl', 'wondering', 'why', 'boyfriend', 'so', 'indifferently', 'other', 'Helen', 'dramatically', 'hair', 'pixie', 'charming', 'single', 'man', 'played', 'John', 'Hannah', 'embarks', 'career', 'freelance', 'event', 'destroying', 'plot', 'will', 'say', 'SLIDING', 'DOORS', 'perfect', 'prescription', 'anyone', 'woman', 'who', 'recently', 'gone', 'bad', 'break-up', 'Proving', 'living', 'well', 'best', 'revenge', 'SLIDING', 'DOORS', 'great', 'choice', 'quiet', 'night', 'home', 'alone', 'group', 'women', 'friends', 'wonder', 'what', 'average', 'guy', 'would', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'imagine', 'would', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'cheater', 'boyfriend', 'Gerry', 'lie', 'head', 'blame', 'Helen', 'when', 'aloud', 'why', 'relationship', 'have', 'changed.', 'Regina', 'McMenamin']",N/A

Yes, it stars Gwyneth Paltrow and at times in the movie, her character, Helen, has got to be somewhat dimwitted about the flakiness of her jittery boyfriend, Gerry.  What makes this film so fascinating is the concept.Helen is your (I suppose) typical Brit, living with her boyfriend Gerry in a cozy flat and doing the 9-5.  On this particular day, as she dashes off to work in a mad Monday morning rush, Gerry slips the phone off the hook and jumps in the shower, preparing for a visit from his former girlfriend/current mistress, Lydia.  Bad enough, but it turns out that Helen is currently the breadwinner of this duo, as Gerry is supposedly hard at work on his first novel.Helen ends up getting fired at work and returns to the tube, to get back home.  This is where the fun starts.  She barely misses the train, leading her to nearly getting mugged on the street, attempting to flag down a cab.  At the same time, we are shown what would have happened had she caught the train.In the first version, she is taken to the hospital and by the time she gets home, Lydia has safely left the apartment and Gerry is in the all clear.  Helen is forced to get a job delivering sandwiches and waiting tables, while Gerry continues working on his book.In the second version, Helen walks in on Gerry and Lydia's tryst and unceremoniously dumps him, moving in with her friend Anna.  She makes the acquaintance of James, an utterly charming businessman played brilliantly by the underrated John Hannah and he convinces her to go out into business for herself and also, to get over Gerry.Without giving too much of the story away, it's interesting how the two very differing paths of version one and two cross each other.  It definitely sends the message that perhaps regardless of which path we may choose, the end result may just be fate.Ms. Paltrow, as always, is lovely and charming as Helen.  John Hannah seems to steal every scene that he is in, as the humorous James - - where can we find a James of our own???John Lynch is perfectly nervous and agitated as the cheating boyfriend and Jeanne Tripplehorn is cattily perfect as the bitchy Lydia.As an additional bonus, the soundtrack is phenomenal!For a fun and interesting take on your average romantic comedy, definitely give ""Sliding Doors"" a try - - you might find, as I have, that it's worth repeated viewings!",5,I Love This Movie!!!,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,2407,"['Sliding', 'Doors', ""n't"", 'typical', 'chick', 'flick', 'Yes', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'times', 'movie', 'character', 'Helen', 'got', 'be', 'somewhat', 'dimwitted', 'flakiness', 'jittery', 'boyfriend', 'Gerry', 'What', 'film', 'so', 'fascinating', 'concept.Helen', 'suppose', 'typical', 'Brit', 'living', 'boyfriend', 'Gerry', 'cozy', 'flat', 'doing', '9-5', 'particular', 'day', 'work', 'mad', 'Monday', 'morning', 'rush', 'Gerry', 'phone', 'hook', 'jumps', 'shower', 'preparing', 'visit', 'former', 'girlfriend/current', 'mistress', 'Lydia', 'Bad', 'enough', 'out', 'Helen', 'currently', 'breadwinner', 'duo', 'Gerry', 'supposedly', 'hard', 'work', 'first', 'novel.Helen', 'up', 'getting', 'fired', 'work', 'returns', 'tube', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'where', 'fun', 'barely', 'train', 'leading', 'nearly', 'getting', 'mugged', 'street', 'attempting', 'flag', 'down', 'cab', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'shown', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'had', 'caught', 'train.In', 'first', 'version', 'taken', 'hospital', 'time', 'home', 'Lydia', 'safely', 'left', 'apartment', 'Gerry', 'clear', 'Helen', 'forced', 'get', 'job', 'delivering', 'sandwiches', 'waiting', 'tables', 'Gerry', 'working', 'book.In', 'second', 'version', 'Helen', 'Gerry', 'Lydia', 'tryst', 'unceremoniously', 'moving', 'friend', 'Anna', 'acquaintance', 'James', 'utterly', 'charming', 'businessman', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'underrated', 'John', 'Hannah', 'go', 'out', 'business', 'herself', 'also', 'get', 'Gerry.Without', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'away', 'interesting', 'how', 'two', 'very', 'differing', 'paths', 'version', 'one', 'two', 'cross', 'other', 'definitely', 'message', 'perhaps', 'regardless', 'path', 'may', 'choose', 'end', 'result', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'fate.Ms', 'Paltrow', 'always', 'lovely', 'charming', 'Helen', 'John', 'Hannah', 'steal', 'scene', 'humorous', 'James', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'James', 'own', 'John', 'Lynch', 'perfectly', 'nervous', 'agitated', 'cheating', 'boyfriend', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'cattily', 'perfect', 'bitchy', 'Lydia.As', 'additional', 'bonus', 'soundtrack', 'phenomenal', 'fun', 'interesting', 'take', 'average', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'definitely', 'give', 'Sliding', 'Doors', 'try', 'might', 'find', 'have', 'worth', 'repeated', 'viewings']",N/A

Schell,"[4, 4]","Once again, we have Gwyneth Paltrow delving into the world of the Brits and sporting an English accent in a story where the director's view seems to be that regardless of the circumstances, fate still plays a vital role  in the final outcome. It is an experiment of the rhetoric &quot;What  if...?&quot;, a splicing of two cells containing scenarios, and their  embryotic outcomes spawning as the film progresses. It begins with our lab  rat (Helen Quilley) leaving her place of employment after she's just been  fired. The cell-dividing begins when she heads for the subway and the two  scenarios are shown consecutively where first she misses the train, and the  second half where she catches it at the last moment. In scenario two, she  arrives home to a cheating boyfriend (a despicable, weak-minded weasel  played convincingly by John Lynch) in mid-coitus with his old lover Lydia,  who is portrayed with amusing fury by Jeanne Tripplehorn. In the previous  scenario, she is forced to walk home after missing the train and is mugged,  taking a trip to the local emergency room and buying time for Gerry (the  cheating boyfriend) to usher Lydia out of the apartment.Where it goes  from there, the scenarios are easily distinguishable. The jilted Helen  packs her bags and moves in with her feisty Irish girlfriend Anna (great  performance by Zara Turner) and cuts her hair, dying it blonde. She then  attaches herself to a new boyfriend with a thick, Scottish accent free of  fabrication named James (great comedic timing on the part of John Hannah).  Both stories have their similarities, which you will see when watching are  the hands of fate working their magic even though the circumstances are  different.I have to give a hand to the writers of this screenplay for  the great one-liners that came out of this movie and the overall snappy wit  of each character. You even have your comedy relief in the form of Gerry's  wisecracking friend Russell, played by Douglas McFerran.This film had a  very good cast and I was intrigued by the premise, but my only problem was  Gwyneth's accent. Yes, she does it better than most, but compared to people  who really did have an English accent, she needs a little more practice  before she can even have Americans fooled. Other than that small detail,  this is a very entertaining and very humorous movie, despite its  surprisingly dour ending.",4,Interesting Look At &quot;What If...&quot;,959040000,"05 23, 2000",2000,2393,"['Once', 'again', 'have', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'delving', 'world', 'Brits', 'sporting', 'English', 'accent', 'story', 'where', 'director', 'view', 'be', 'regardless', 'circumstances', 'fate', 'still', 'vital', 'role', 'final', 'outcome', 'experiment', 'rhetoric', 'quot', 'What', 'quot', 'splicing', 'two', 'cells', 'containing', 'scenarios', 'embryotic', 'outcomes', 'spawning', 'film', 'lab', 'rat', 'Helen', 'Quilley', 'leaving', 'place', 'employment', 'just', 'been', 'fired', 'cell-dividing', 'begins', 'when', 'subway', 'two', 'scenarios', 'are', 'shown', 'consecutively', 'where', 'first', 'train', 'second', 'half', 'where', 'last', 'moment', 'scenario', 'two', 'home', 'cheating', 'boyfriend', 'despicable', 'weak-minded', 'weasel', 'played', 'convincingly', 'John', 'Lynch', 'mid-coitus', 'old', 'lover', 'Lydia', 'who', 'portrayed', 'amusing', 'fury', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'previous', 'scenario', 'forced', 'walk', 'home', 'missing', 'train', 'mugged', 'taking', 'trip', 'local', 'emergency', 'room', 'buying', 'time', 'Gerry', 'cheating', 'boyfriend', 'usher', 'Lydia', 'apartment.Where', 'there', 'scenarios', 'are', 'easily', 'distinguishable', 'jilted', 'Helen', 'bags', 'moves', 'feisty', 'Irish', 'girlfriend', 'Anna', 'great', 'performance', 'Zara', 'Turner', 'hair', 'dying', 'blonde', 'then', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'thick', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'free', 'fabrication', 'named', 'James', 'great', 'comedic', 'timing', 'part', 'John', 'Hannah', 'stories', 'have', 'similarities', 'will', 'see', 'when', 'watching', 'are', 'hands', 'fate', 'working', 'magic', 'even', 'circumstances', 'are', 'different.I', 'have', 'give', 'hand', 'writers', 'screenplay', 'great', 'one-liners', 'came', 'movie', 'overall', 'snappy', 'wit', 'character', 'even', 'have', 'comedy', 'relief', 'form', 'Gerry', 'wisecracking', 'friend', 'Russell', 'played', 'Douglas', 'McFerran.This', 'film', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'cast', 'was', 'intrigued', 'premise', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'Gwyneth', 'accent', 'Yes', 'better', 'most', 'compared', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'did', 'have', 'English', 'accent', 'little', 'more', 'practice', 'can', 'even', 'have', 'Americans', 'fooled', 'Other', 'small', 'detail', 'very', 'entertaining', 'very', 'humorous', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'dour', 'ending']",N/A

Take the life of an average woman and show what happens if she a) misses a train,  gets mugged waiting for a taxi,  and arrives home well after the departure of the woman her boyfriend is cheating with;  and b) catches the train,  is chatted up by an appealing stranger during the ride,  and catches the cheating boyfriend,  thereby freeing her up to start a new life and date the aforementioned stranger.I've read criticisms of the two story lines and of what a difference there is in the two male love interests,  but therein lies the intriguing part of the film.

The blond haired Helen,  who might not otherwise leave Jerry,  is forced into a place where she has to reinvent herself,  but the benefit is finding James,  who everyone can see is much better for her.My main problem with this film is that Lydia,  the ""other woman"",  is such a heinous b**** that you don't really understand Jerry's continued involvement with her.  Had she been a nicer person,  one could better understand his inability to leave her,  but she's so horrid that their shared past isn't enough to account for why he keeps going with her,  especially when he has the sweet and supportive Helen at his side.Quibbling over why two American actors play the two main females is silly,  IMO,  they are both wonderful.  Gwyneth Paltrow is so believeable as an English woman that you if you didn't know she was American,  you'd never be able to tell from this movie.  John Lynch is an Irish actor,  if I'm not mistaken,  why not gripe that they didn't choose an Englishman to play Jerry?  Anyway,  all the characters work,  despite their accents and where the actors started out from.The ending is chaotic and confusing,  but they both lead to the resolution-lest one think that one Helen is home free and the other Helen got the short end of the stick,  this sudden twist takes care of it.  We are led to believe that Helen ends up with true love in spite of it all.  I recommend this movie as a thought-provoking alternative to some of the brain-dead romantic comedies out there.",5,"Smarter than the average ""chick flick""",1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,2316,"['very', 'watchable', 'movie', 'very', 'original', 'premise', 'Take', 'life', 'average', 'woman', 'show', 'what', 'train', 'mugged', 'waiting', 'taxi', 'home', 'well', 'departure', 'woman', 'boyfriend', 'cheating', 'b', 'train', 'chatted', 'up', 'appealing', 'stranger', 'ride', 'cheating', 'boyfriend', 'thereby', 'freeing', 'up', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'date', 'aforementioned', 'stranger.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'criticisms', 'two', 'story', 'lines', 'what', 'difference', 'two', 'male', 'love', 'interests', 'therein', 'intriguing', 'part', 'film', 'brown-haired', 'Helen', ""n't"", 'catch', 'cheater', 'action', 'so', 'reason', 'leave', 'relationship', 'even', 'red', 'flags', 'are', 'raised', 'doubt', 'boyfriend', 'commitment', 'blond', 'haired', 'Helen', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'otherwise', 'leave', 'Jerry', 'forced', 'place', 'where', 'reinvent', 'benefit', 'finding', 'James', 'who', 'everyone', 'can', 'see', 'much', 'better', 'her.My', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'Lydia', 'other', 'woman', 'such', 'heinous', 'b****', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'Jerry', 'continued', 'involvement', 'Had', 'been', 'nicer', 'person', 'one', 'could', 'better', 'understand', 'inability', 'leave', 'so', 'horrid', 'shared', 'past', ""n't"", 'enough', 'account', 'why', 'going', 'especially', 'when', 'sweet', 'supportive', 'Helen', 'side.Quibbling', 'over', 'why', 'two', 'American', 'actors', 'play', 'two', 'main', 'females', 'silly', 'IMO', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'so', 'believeable', 'English', 'woman', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'American', ""'d"", 'never', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'movie', 'John', 'Lynch', 'Irish', 'actor', ""'m"", 'not', 'mistaken', 'why', 'not', 'gripe', 'did', ""n't"", 'choose', 'Englishman', 'play', 'Jerry', 'Anyway', 'characters', 'work', 'accents', 'where', 'actors', 'started', 'out', 'from.The', 'ending', 'chaotic', 'confusing', 'lead', 'resolution-lest', 'one', 'think', 'one', 'Helen', 'home', 'free', 'other', 'Helen', 'got', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'sudden', 'twist', 'care', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'Helen', 'up', 'true', 'love', 'spite', 'recommend', 'movie', 'thought-provoking', 'alternative', 'brain-dead', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'there']",N/A

450559,A342EHO42V2G38,6305132100,"Terran ""Terran""","[21, 28]","Though the reviewers here seem to have a basically high opinion of the film, I found myself bothered by a lot of things.  Mainly the male POV prevalent throughout that two female characters, presumably both intelligent and attractive, would bother wasting themselves on someone who doesn't deserve their time of day:  namely two-timing boyfriend Gerry, who is living with Paltrow's ""Helen"" while she supports him totally as he is supposedly writing a novel.  Right there, immediately the film came to a grinding halt for me.  I already have to think both Helen and the pre-Helen girlfriend who is back in Gerry's life are self-destructive, low self-esteem types who will take any man on a platter that is given up to them:  This Gerry isn't attractive, either physically or emotionally, to explain away his appeal to these women.  And without some blinding charismatic trait of Gerry's to make this plot seem feasible, this means the screenwriter just has a low opinion of females in general.  Or the male lead was badly cast.  Probably a combination of the two.And Helen's second romantic prospect isn't that great at final glance either, as it turns out a very important piece of information about him isn't revealed to Helen until near the end of the film, meaning though we're meant to assume he's her knight in shining armor (she needs rescuing from Gerry, at least the screenwriter gives us that) he can be kind of casual in the honesty department.And Gerry?  In the dual-plot he manages to make both his official and unofficial girlfriends pregnant, meaning he's not likely to be that responsible when it comes to you-know-what.  So he's stupid on top of everything else.My final dissatisfaction with the film is a general disgust with a certain cliche used in films, that the rebound romance is really the romance you've been waiting for.  The cliche evolved probably to give broken-hearted audience members hope for something better, but in real life, a rebound romance is a needful one, and a part of the grieving/separation process, but a rebound romance that turns to an offical partnership, such as marriage, is nearly always doomed to failure.  But here, in this film, in whichever reality, we're seeing Helen necessarily getting her wake up call and ditching Gerry only to fall immediately into a love affair with James, the not-as-honest-and-sweet-as-we-want-to-think-he-is.  But it's understood in Hollywood parlance that Helen and James will live happily-ever-after - because they were fated, you know?For a comedy there were very few laughs, in fact I don't remember any.  So perhaps this film is mistakenly labelled as such.  Otherwise, for nitpickers, Paltrow definitely looks better as a sophisticated blonde than as a casual brunette, and there seems to be an extreme shortage of goodlooking men in England.  We really needed Jude Law in this one in order to make it work.  In fact, the male casting could have been Daniel Craig and Jude Law - either man in either part - and it would have worked a lot better, along with a touchup to the script.Instead of a film, this would have been better as a single episode of a television one hour anthology series.

450566,AEPPGGR3KBXZT,6305132100,vantran@earthlink.net,"[1, 2]","First-time Brit director/writer Peter Howitt has given us an intriguing romantic comedy in Sliding Doors, a movie that explores the fascinating concept of fate, and how trivial matters in our daily encountering could  have far more profound consequences in our lives than we realize. The  movie's humor and wit reminded me most of Four Weddings and a Funeral, my  favorite romantic comedy of all-time. Incidentially, John Hannah, who also  appeared in Four Weddings, plays the love interest of Gwyneth Paltrow. They  have a wonderful screen presence together, with a solid supporting cast to  boost. The script is effective in juggling the two paths of Helen's life,  keeping me caring and guessing till the very end.As with most of  Paramount releases, the DVD is sorely lacking in feature. Given that there  is no extra, I would prefer that the disc would automatically play when  inserted. The default soundtrack of the movie is Pro-Logic, so if you have  a Dolby Digital setup, you would need to make that selection on the menu  each time. The soundtrack options could not be selected during the movie.  With that aside, I am quite pleased with the transfer. The picture is  perfectly matted at approximately 1.85:1. 16x9 enhancement is not available  to widescreen set owners, and while I detest pan and scan format, the movie  would be suitable for those that prefer the format and should be made  available on the unused side. Images are generally sharp, but prone to  graininess at times, mostly on static backgrounds. Also exhibiting are  minor jaggedness on edges and dirt particles on the print. Colors, however,  are striking, with memorable scenes of neon displays inside the small diner  and the picturesque Hammersmith Bridge at night against the twinkling  skyline backdrop. Fleshtones are natural throughout.The Dolby Digital  soundtrack has a good use for the front channels, but little else for the  surrounds. Occassionally, there are realistic effects of pouring rain and  crowd noise, which are the extended mix for the surrounds. The movie does  have a delightful collection of songs from British bands that lend nicely  to the setting. As for the dialogue, I believe that I read once somewhere  that the movie was dubbed on some prints with a friendlier accent for the  American audiences.
