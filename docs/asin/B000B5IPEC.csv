How can you not love both his characters from 'Baby, the Rain Must Fall' and the 'The War Lover' !! Movies from that era are blessed with a lot of very good speaking parts for the characters. both are actors movies.",4,Steve McQueen: A Real Movie Star.,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,374,"['Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'far', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'screen', 'presence', 'subtleties', 'acting', 'How', 'can', 'not', 'love', 'characters', ""'Baby"", 'Rain', 'Must', 'Fall', ""'The"", 'War', 'Lover', 'Movies', 'era', 'are', 'blessed', 'lot', 'very', 'good', 'speaking', 'parts', 'characters', 'are', 'actors', 'movies']",The Steve McQueen Boxed Set: (Baby / the Rain Must Fall / The War Lover)

He had a cool presents (a cool) that few actors can match or come close to matching.  I like Steve McQueen as an actor.  All of his movies have been good.

This is a great deal for the price and each movie comes in their own slim case with artwork. ""Baby, the Rain must Fall"" is in Widescreen (1.85:1) and ""The War Lover"" is in both Wide and Full mode, they are also in B/W and they run for about 102mins each. For ""The War Lover,"" after you select play it will take you to a selection of Widescreen or Full screen, so you can choose what you'd like to see. By the way, I will upload some pictures of the cases. These are two great films and I would recommend these and this set to anyone.
