Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas are explored, and Birthday episodes are a great bonus to this DVD.  My daughter is a huge Caillou fan.  Although his voice is whiney (why!?!), I really do enjoy the stories and lessons from each episode.  I do consider it quality programming, especially for a cartoon.Highly recommend!!",5,Excellent Holiday Collection,1162944000,"11 8, 2006",2006,459,"['Almost', 'top', 'holidays', 'are', 'featured', 'DVD', 'Chanukah', 'Easter', 'was', 'nice', 'have', 'collection', 'one', 'DVD', 'Halloween', 'Thanksgiving', 'Christmas', 'are', 'explored', 'Birthday', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'daughter', 'huge', 'Caillou', 'fan', 'voice', 'whiney', 'why', 'really', 'do', 'enjoy', 'stories', 'lessons', 'episode', 'do', 'consider', 'quality', 'programming', 'especially', 'cartoon.Highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Caillou can be a bit whiny at times, but my 5 year old daughter enjoys him, so that's the main thing.  The holiday and birthday activities were fun to watch and held my child's interest.  I definitely got my money's worth with this DVD.",5,"Great DVD, several episodes",1219449600,"08 23, 2008",2008,411,"['really', 'liked', 'length', 'DVD', 'can', 'entertain', 'quite', 'while', 'necessary', 'separate', 'episodes', 'make', 'finding', 'cut-off', 'point', 'easy', 'what', 'need', 'Caillou', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'whiny', 'times', '5', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'main', 'thing', 'holiday', 'birthday', 'activities', 'were', 'fun', 'watch', 'held', 'child', 'interest', 'definitely', 'got', 'money', 'worth', 'DVD']",N/A

First, there isn't a Halloween episode though there are two sequences with the dancing kids between the cartoons. Frankly, there's a little too much of the puppets AND the dancing kids between the shows. They should stick with one or the other or alternate them and show more cartoons.Overall, it's ok but could be much better if they featured at least two shows per holiday.",3,Needs more ...,1219536000,"08 24, 2008",2008,518,"['kids', 'love', 'Caillou', 'when', 'saw', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'surprise', 'holiday', 'shows', 'Unfortunately', 'lot', 'things', 'missing', 'First', ""n't"", 'Halloween', 'episode', 'are', 'two', 'sequences', 'dancing', 'kids', 'cartoons', 'Frankly', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'puppets', 'dancing', 'kids', 'shows', 'should', 'stick', 'one', 'other', 'alternate', 'show', 'more', 'cartoons.Overall', 'ok', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'featured', 'least', 'two', 'shows', 'holiday']",N/A
715597,A3NXCL9NJTL3TF,B00006G8NS,Target Shopaholic,"[1, 1]","I bought this used for my daughter who just loves Caillou. She's just about 2. Quite frankly, I can find better Caillou videos online and just piece them together into a homemade video. For example, I found a Halloween video called Caillou's Halloween Costume on YT that is far better than the one included in this DVD. Also, there is another one on YT that is titled Caillou Goes Caroling for the Christmas theme. Simply put, there just aren't enough Caillou videos compared to all the extra stuff they throw in this DVD like puppets & dancing/singing kids. A little of that stuff, like every 3rd Caillou video is nice but the ratio feels more like 35% Caillou and 65% filler. Not what I was expecting.Note that there is no description for this DVD either. This is a pretty old DVD so maybe nobody's interested anymore but Caillou seems to be a classic. What's included in this disc is Caillou picking out pumpkins, a Thanksgiving dinner, decorating a Christmas tree, going skiing, Caillou celebrates Leo's birthday and Chinese New Year w/Sara.",2,Not enough Caillou,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,1045,"['bought', 'used', 'daughter', 'who', 'just', 'Caillou', 'just', 'about', '2', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'can', 'find', 'better', 'Caillou', 'videos', 'online', 'just', 'piece', 'together', 'homemade', 'video', 'example', 'found', 'Halloween', 'video', 'called', 'Caillou', 'Halloween', 'Costume', 'YT', 'far', 'better', 'one', 'included', 'DVD', 'Also', 'one', 'YT', 'titled', 'Caillou', 'Goes', 'Caroling', 'Christmas', 'theme', 'Simply', 'put', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Caillou', 'videos', 'compared', 'extra', 'stuff', 'throw', 'DVD', 'puppets', 'dancing/singing', 'kids', 'little', 'stuff', '3rd', 'Caillou', 'video', 'nice', 'ratio', 'more', '35', '%', 'Caillou', '65', '%', 'filler', 'Not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting.Note', 'description', 'DVD', 'either', 'pretty', 'old', 'DVD', 'so', 'maybe', 'nobody', 'interested', 'anymore', 'Caillou', 'be', 'classic', 'What', 'included', 'disc', 'Caillou', 'picking', 'out', 'pumpkins', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'decorating', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'going', 'skiing', 'Caillou', 'Leo', 'birthday', 'Chinese', 'New', 'Year', 'w/Sara']",N/A
