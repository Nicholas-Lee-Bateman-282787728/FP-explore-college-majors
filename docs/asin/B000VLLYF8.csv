The stand-up comedy from the other comedians in the film were great also. I have no complaints and I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is considering it's purchase. It is a must for your Katt Williams library. I hope this helps.

1102933,AD3WV8EHGVKH5,B000VLLYF8,Lady Di,"[1, 2]","Having viewed Pimp Chronicles 1 and the Live set from his hometown in Ohio, I felt he could have done better - LOTS. I'm not using either of those to judge this work by, I'm just showing I've done the research and it just goes like that. He claims to be ""journalist"" of sort and it was apparent one of 2 things happened. Either the newspapers and TV access to the latest possible new material were totally out of reach or someone (people) got to him after PC 1. Reportedly someone from MJ's camp didn't like the jokes in PC 1 too toughly. Possibly leading to the sound of hurt from 'a kid getting his prized gadgets taken away' remarks such as ""...I can say what I want about MJ..."" and ""...I'm only going to talk about my friends now..."" during this set.Also, this was renamed from the original title 'Pimp Chronicles 2' to the title we see here. Maybe with 'American Gangster' the movie, the series and the Jay Z album plus any tossed in the mix 'American' named projects being released about or around the same time, maybe he thought he could fool us. Sorry, not me. I was hoping for better material. After all it is ""2007 in this b****"". There were some new jokes, there was the skits before and after  as well as the comedic showcases of 3 other friends of his. It wasn't necessarily needed, to me. Was this supposed to be IN theaters instead of straight to DVD? Who knows but I will say this in closing. Katt, it's 2008 and if you're preparing another DVD release, please read the newspaper and not just pose with it!!
