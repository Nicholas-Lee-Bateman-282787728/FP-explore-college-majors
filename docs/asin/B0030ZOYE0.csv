I'd been waiting for this to be re-released and ordred it. Amazon did their usual great job of delivery and this was soon in my hands. It's a hoot.The plot concerns a young witch who joins a squadron of girls fighting against an evil enemy called the neuroi. They don't wear trousers for some reason which gives a lot of the fan service. The first few episodes add some descriptive metaphorical flesh to the characters before the main plot kicks in. An evil airforce general wants the witches gone and replaces them with a prototype wonder machine. The predictable chaos ensues and the 501st squadron witches ride to the rescue. Happy ending, bad guys vanquised, etc, etc.When I review things I prefer not to spoil the plot too much, after all why would you then watc h it. This was fun in a light hearted way. The plot has sufficient twists and turns to engage and the character interactions both support the plot and add to it as well. There's some inevitable fan service but nothing too over the top.

Can these young ladies in not so military garb defeat the enemy, or is there someone out there who wants to take them down?Overall it was an enjoyable series, from the beginning to the end.

1316276,A2XYUUR8XKG1E2,B0030ZOYE0,Brian Heyn,"[0, 0]","You can't get away with talking about Strike Witches without talking about the fan service.  It is everywhere, and arguably it is the focus of the show.  I do not mind fan service, but if it certainly not enough to make me watch a show.  Thankfully, GONZO studios realized this and added things like plot, and character development, and exciting battle sequences to the fan service(not to mention a ton of fun historical references).  It is still a fan service show though, with panty shots, nipples, skinship, hinted lesbianism, and plenty of bath scenes.  If those bother you, then this is not the series for you.What makes the show highly entertaining is the humor, which works(in a world where women don't wear pants, watching a woman try and catch a ride by showing her legs, and the driver not even giving her a second glance is hilarious), the overarching storyline set in an alternate history that is actually interesting, characters who are interesting, and most of all, the battle scenes.  The battle scenes are exciting and well animated, and wonderfully creative at times.  Watching the girls fly around with their oversized guns, desperately battling the Neroi is a blast.  The animation is top notch most of the time(though the CG gets a bit varied away at points).Both the Japanese and English voice casts are good, the video quality looked good to my eye, the animation was excellent, the extras almost nonexistant as is usual from Funimation.All in all, a fun if mostly mindless anime series.  Nothing great, nothing that has not been done before, but a very solid release.And one last note.  I mentioned fun historical references in the opening paragraph.  One example(though from the second season and light novels/manga...but the coolest example): Adolfine Galland, the only woman in the series to wear pants.  She is based on Adolf Galland a WW2 German pilot who was notable in part for not wearing pants while he flew, but instead swimming trunks.",4,"Not Just Fan Service, But Fan Service Done Right, With Plot!",1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,1969,"['ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'talking', 'Strike', 'Witches', 'talking', 'fan', 'service', 'everywhere', 'arguably', 'focus', 'show', 'do', 'not', 'mind', 'fan', 'service', 'certainly', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'watch', 'show', 'Thankfully', 'GONZO', 'realized', 'added', 'things', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'exciting', 'battle', 'sequences', 'fan', 'service', 'not', 'mention', 'ton', 'fun', 'historical', 'references', 'still', 'fan', 'service', 'show', 'panty', 'shots', 'nipples', 'skinship', 'hinted', 'lesbianism', 'plenty', 'bath', 'scenes', 'then', 'not', 'series', 'you.What', 'show', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'humor', 'world', 'where', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'wear', 'pants', 'watching', 'woman', 'try', 'catch', 'ride', 'showing', 'legs', 'driver', 'not', 'even', 'giving', 'second', 'glance', 'hilarious', 'overarching', 'storyline', 'set', 'alternate', 'history', 'actually', 'interesting', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'interesting', 'most', 'battle', 'scenes', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'exciting', 'well', 'animated', 'wonderfully', 'creative', 'times', 'Watching', 'girls', 'fly', 'oversized', 'guns', 'desperately', 'battling', 'Neroi', 'blast', 'animation', 'top', 'notch', 'most', 'time', 'CG', 'bit', 'varied', 'away', 'points', '.Both', 'Japanese', 'English', 'voice', 'casts', 'are', 'good', 'video', 'quality', 'looked', 'good', 'eye', 'animation', 'was', 'excellent', 'extras', 'almost', 'nonexistant', 'usual', 'Funimation.All', 'fun', 'mostly', 'mindless', 'anime', 'series', 'Nothing', 'great', 'nothing', 'not', 'been', 'done', 'very', 'solid', 'release.And', 'one', 'last', 'note', 'mentioned', 'fun', 'historical', 'references', 'opening', 'paragraph', 'One', 'example', 'second', 'season', 'light', 'novels/manga', 'coolest', 'example', 'Adolfine', 'Galland', 'only', 'woman', 'series', 'wear', 'pants', 'based', 'Adolf', 'Galland', 'WW2', 'German', 'pilot', 'who', 'was', 'notable', 'part', 'not', 'wearing', 'pants', 'flew', 'instead', 'swimming', 'trunks']",N/A
1316277,A3QO324Z4CUNNO,B0030ZOYE0,"Charles Stuckey ""stuck-fla""","[6, 6]","At first it looks like little more than fan service on a stick. Get past it, this is one of the best stories I've seen in a long time. Character development is good and the story line is engaging and well written. It's not as generic of a storyline as it seemingly starts out either. Due to the ""fan service"" and some adult situations I'd probably not recommend it for children, at least not without adult supervision and having watched it first. On the plus side for parents, there's not a lot of blood and it's handled tastefully (It IS a war, injuries happen).The setting is an alternate world where WWII was preempted due to an alien invasion and the only effective force to fight them is magic. Magic is not commonplace, so witches are recruited from all over the world to fly the ""Striker Units"". (If you look at the case, you'll see one on each leg of the main character). They even have magic propellers keeping the ""WWII"" feel intact. The countries are all renamed to give it a more ""alternate world"" feel, but it's not hard to figure out. I prefer not to give away the storyline in reviews. I will say there is an interesting contrast in the main character, who fights only because she wants to protect as many people as she can. (And at first seems to be an adamant pacifist, which never entirely fades). There is also some interesting character development around why people fight and the effects their reasons have on them. A little simplified, but it is only 12 episodes.LASTLY! This is a DO NOT MISS IT anime for most fans, almost regardless of the type you like.

Funny thing is while wacthing this i really didnt notice the fanservice as much as when i watched Rosario + Vampire. It was ridiculas the way they basically threw a panty shot in almost every seen just to show their panties. Now dont get me wrong i dont mind fanservie so long as it adds some humor but to show panties for the sake of showing them gets old mighty fast.

Hawkins,"[1, 2]","Ordinarily I don't include a plot synopsis with my reviews, but I'm making an exception in this case.In an alternate universe, a group of teenage girls with magical powers--&#34;Strike Witches&#34;--arefighting the Battle of Britain. Instead of Nazis, they are fighting hordes of bloodthirsty alienscalled Neuroi. They do so by means of magical flying gear which is donned like a pair of thigh-highboots--which is apparently the reason they go around bare-legged all the time.Be warned: this anime depicts not panty-shots, but the girls running around in their underwear aspart of their official uniform (horrors!). (One episode becomes a game of &#34;musical panties&#34; whereinone girl misplaces hers, takes another girl's, forcing her to take another's, and so on. It is done forcomic relief from the often rather grim storyline, and is done so whimsically that it is hard toimagine anyone taking offense--at least no one who would be watching at all.) It also contains somebath-house nudity, but Strike Witches is much more than your run-of-the-mill fan-service anime.There is a war going on, with all that implies. There is tragedy and triumph, terror and bravery, selfishnessand self-sacrifice, and above all, a cast of characters one can't help but identify with.

But you have to remember that the storyline of the series and the characters make the series very entertaining to watch and lets be frank anyone who has seen either the trailers or some episodes online can't be shocked or disgruntled on what's in the series itself.  The basic story is you have alien invaders attacking most of the world in a seemingly 1940's era setting and so to defend humanity from these invaders young females are enlisted who have powerful magical abilities to fight these unknown monstrosities,  of course there is more to the series but just is the short basis of the series itself.  The characters themselves are enjoyable enough to watch but there are one or two that are pretty one-dimensional,  meaning you'll have at least the standard rookie fighter who has to find in herself the courage and self determination to rise above her self doubts about her abilities as a strike witch as well as find the real reason for her choices.  The animation and soundtrack are put together rather well though you'll get the standard fan-service shot in about every scene but again that's pretty much expected,  the voice cast for the Japanese and English crew did their characters very well too so no complaints on that part either.  A Little off topic is I saw that there were a couple of naysayers of the series but who apparently never seen it at least that's how it feels,  I'm not saying this series will be for everyone because it won't but if you're shocked on the fan-service than you're about twenty years to late as so many anime has some kind of fan-service and again while there is an overabundance in the series it doesn't take it to the extreme as with a couple of the more darker animes out there...",5,An Enjoyable Action Somewhat Mecha Anime But With A Ton Of Fan Service Too,1311206400,"07 21, 2011",2011,1899,"['whole', 'series', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'might', 'be', 'pushed', 'away', 'one', 'fan', 'service', 'Mostly', 'standard', 'panty', 'shots', 'can', 'times', 'be', 'gratuitous', 'have', 'remember', 'storyline', 'series', 'characters', 'make', 'series', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'lets', 'be', 'frank', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'trailers', 'episodes', 'online', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'shocked', 'disgruntled', 'what', 'series', 'basic', 'story', 'have', 'alien', 'invaders', 'attacking', 'most', 'world', 'seemingly', '1940', 'era', 'setting', 'so', 'defend', 'humanity', 'invaders', 'young', 'females', 'are', 'enlisted', 'who', 'have', 'powerful', 'magical', 'abilities', 'fight', 'unknown', 'monstrosities', 'course', 'more', 'series', 'just', 'short', 'basis', 'series', 'characters', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'watch', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'are', 'pretty', 'one-dimensional', 'meaning', ""'ll"", 'have', 'least', 'standard', 'rookie', 'fighter', 'who', 'find', 'courage', 'determination', 'rise', 'self', 'doubts', 'abilities', 'strike', 'witch', 'as', 'well', 'find', 'real', 'reason', 'choices', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'put', 'together', 'rather', 'well', ""'ll"", 'get', 'standard', 'fan-service', 'shot', 'about', 'scene', 'again', 'pretty', 'much', 'expected', 'voice', 'cast', 'Japanese', 'English', 'crew', 'did', 'characters', 'very', 'well', 'too', 'so', 'no', 'complaints', 'part', 'Little', 'off', 'topic', 'saw', 'were', 'couple', 'naysayers', 'series', 'who', 'apparently', 'never', 'seen', 'least', 'how', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'everyone', 'wo', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'shocked', 'fan-service', ""'re"", 'twenty', 'years', 'late', 'so', 'many', 'anime', 'kind', 'fan-service', 'again', 'overabundance', 'series', ""n't"", 'take', 'extreme', 'couple', 'more', 'darker', 'out', 'there']",N/A
