I disagree with the New Yorker review posted here -- although they are correct when they say Jennifer Aniston is a limited actress, I think she shines by far the brightest in this uneven, annoying ""indie"" flick.  The characters in this movie are so maniacally irritating and unlikeable, I may have to reconsider my usual preference for ""character-driven"" films and move grudgingly toward viewing movies with explosions and car chases.  The script is uneven and unbelievable, featuring people unlike any I have ever met -- and to which I certainly cannot relate.  It takes a few cliche rich, whiny Los Angeleans and tries to make us feel sorry for them when, in truth, they are much easier to despise.  How can anybody care enough about these characters to make this movie worth the emotional investment?

645180,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B00005JP28,A Customer,"[18, 19]","When Olivia (Jennifer Aniston) goes out to dinner with her three long-time best friends, Franny (Joan Cusack), Jane (Frances McDormand) and Christine (Catherine Keener), it always seems as though she's a bit of a fish out of water. Olivia is the only one that is single and lacks enough money and financial security to make her life really comfortable.Her friends sort of know that she is constantly strapped for cash and that she now works as a maid, cleaning the houses of the wealthy Westsiders after she left her career as a schoolteacher because she just ""couldn't handle it any more.""In Friends With Money, the wonderful new movie written and directed by Nicole Holofcener not much happens to Olivia but it doesn't matter because she - as well as well as her friends - are so well defined, funny and interesting. Does the amount of money you have really lead to happiness? Although, Olivier's yuppie friends are rich and the quality of their marriages differ, are their situations that different from Olivier's?While Christine (Keener) and her husband and writing partner David (Jason Isaacs) spar over home renovations, fashion designer Jane (McDormand) has stopped washing her hair and seems to be going through some kind of forties mid-life crisis, wondering whether this is all there is. She spews hate at other drivers and at store managers, but her anger is often aimed at her sexually ambivalent husband Aaron (Simon McBurney) who seems to prefer the company of men to her.The bourgeois comforts of Christine's career success appear to be breaking apart: is it a coincidence that David's petty insults about her weight gain and the neighbours' chilly reaction to their view-blocking annex escalate at the same time? Christine's tensions contrast with the parental bliss shared by her sympathetically affluent chum Franny (Cusak) and her wealthy husband, Matt (Greg Germann) who are about to donate two million dollars to their kid's school, even though the school probably doesn't need it.Obviously, they all have money, but these self-obsessed, hard working people certainly have a lot issues to work through. Yet it is Olivia who seems to anchor the group. She's a wonderfully quirky character who goes from cosmetic counter to cosmetic counter in order to collect enough free samples to keep her complexion looking great. And when Franny hooks her up on a date with her luggish personal fitness instructor (Scott Caan) things don't work out exactly as Olivia planned.The actresses are all phenomenal, the writing is pitch-perfect and the direction is crisp and droll. Poor Olivia - her large-living friends don't quite know what to make of her, or what to do for her. They obviously love her, but are driven to constantly ridicule her lack of ambition and her lack of income. And the fact that she smokes pot and has been carrying on an affair with a married man is a constant source of discomfort for them.Aniston, especially shines, she's absolutely charming and very likable without dominating the film, which divvies up the goods with great equability among its idiosyncratic and often argumentative characters. Friends With Money is such an ""LA"" movie, and Holofcener, to her credit, has really managed to capture all the insecurities, petty quirks and foibles of this very upper-middle class Westside set, in all their self-congratulatory and pretentious grandeur.

645188,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005JP28,B. E Jackson,"[5, 5]","Friends with Money was a pretty good comedy movie with a bit of seriousness and truth thrown in.  It's about all these different couples who talk to each other, and then when the girlfriends and boyfriends (or wives and husbands) leave their friends home (or restaurant or wherever the meeting place was) on the drive home, they criticize their friends and basically talk about them behind their backs.I got the feeling on many occasions that the wives and girlfriends were more concerned with being jealous of each other instead of actually caring about the friendships they've developed with each other.  I think that's part of reality anyway- secretly we do become jealous of our friends when they're able to accomplish something we haven't been able to yet.There's also an important message behind this film- don't take things too seriously or you won't be able to enjoy life.  Of course, the more obvious message is that it really stinks how the world has to constantly revolve around money, but I got more out of this movie than just that.Anyway, the film was really good.

At any rate, I really really really liked this movie.  I enjoyed seeing a representation of four 40-something LA women whose lives are beyond their looks and their appeal to men.  The men in this movie are pretty much narcissistic jerks, and I don't know how fair that is.  OK, so it's Southern California and narcissism is an inescapable part of the landscape, but all the men aren't like that, are they?Frances McDormand plays a dress designer who thinks of herself as ugly, married to what the director called a ""sexually ambivalent"" man.  Ambivalent or not, her husband loves her and he does not falter in this.  He's there for her during what the director calls ""peri-menopause,"" but I found it disappointing that she had to be labeled dysfunctional to justify speaking up and saying things that needed to be said, like ""HEY! I was waiting for that parking space!"" or ""Excuse me, but I've been waiting here and you cannot just cut in line in front of me like that.""  She's dealing with the invisibility of women past their visual prime and she refuses to be ignored.  Now that is feminism at its best, especially in a place where it's all about youth and working a ""look good.""The media has labeled this film a ""chick flick,"" but that's inaccurate.  Chick flicks are about young, shallow females whose lives revolve around boys, clothes, and some post-modern girl's fantasy life.  These are real women living real lives with real issues and struggles. I'm not sure why it's called Friends With Money, because their financial situations range from rich enough to not have to work (but not Bill Gates or movie-star rich) to working class.  Joan Cusack and her husband are the friends with money, and they have enough of it to give millions away.  Money or not, these women are indeed friends.One true thing about this movie is the way they like to sit around and discuss one another's lives, taking stock, rehashing, and predicting.  The good news is they truly do care about and love one another and are there for one another when things are rough.  Forget about the money; these women are friends and have been for years and it's interesting to see how they honestly relate with one another as they struggle through the muck of middle age.

645196,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00005JP28,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[4, 6]","I absolutely loved `Friends with Money'.  The chemistry between the four friends Olivia (Aniston), Franny (Cusack), Jane (McDormand) and Christine (Keener) is absolutely believable and conveys a sense of realism.  It really draws you to the characters and makes you feel for them throughout the film.Now, as much as Jennifer Aniston is considered the star, to me the entire cast is more supporting and they all stand out.  Olivia is the only single friend, and the rest of her friends feel sorry for her for they feel she's alone and lonely, but as the film progresses we see that her friends have just as many if not more problems than she does.  Christine is married to David (Isaacs) who has fallen out of love with her and shows this by his constant lack of concern for her feelings.  Jane is married to Aaron (McBurney) who every else is convinced is gay, and quite frankly there are a few times the viewer may suspect as well, but in the end I think it's pure speculation.  Aaron loves his wife very much and, out of all the significant others involved he is the most understanding and kind.  Jane though is going through a bit of a mid-life-crisis that is making her a bit difficult to deal with.  Franny is married to Matt (Germann), and while they seem to have a close relationship you can see his despise for her friends and this plays heavy into her reaction to them.  He's materialistic, and quite frankly a jerk.  Olivia is struggling to find the right relationship.  She's been involved with married men, and then recently with a complete jerk of a sex-pot named Mike (Caan) and she's feeling lost, but as she watches her friends and their relationships falling apart she realizes that we all have problems, she's not alone, her friends are not perfect (yeah and that money doesn't bring happiness) and that special someone she's been waiting for may be the one person she never expected.The acting across the board is fantastic, especially on the part of Francis McDormand who is brilliant in delivery on a woman on the verge of insanity.

645197,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JP28,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 3]","I'll be honest - I only watched this film because Jennifer Aniston is in it.  Not surprisingly, I had a hard time relating to the film and figuring out how I felt about it.  Early on, I was asking just how many characters are in this movie, as every scene seemed to throw more and more of them at me.  About half-way through, I was questioning my decision to ever introduce myself to these Friends With Money (most of these characters can really be annoying).  Then, somewhere between this point and the end - despite the fact that the film doesn't seem to have much of a point to it - I ended up liking it.  I'm still not sure why.  If the film does have any point at all, it would have to be the fact that money does not buy happiness.  Only a couple of these characters are the least bit happy or content.So we have this group of friends, all of whom are married and wealthy except for Olivia (Jennifer Aniston).  We don't know when the friendship began, but the fact that the other women are significantly older than Olivia seems a little strange to me.  Franny (Joan Cusack) and Matt (Greg Germann) are normal and happy, Christine (Catherine Keener) and her husband are normal and unhappy, and Jane (Frances McDormand) and Aaron (Simon McBurney) are neither normal nor happy - actually, Aaron's happy but Jane is unhappy enough for the both of them.  She's also borderline insane, as whatever midlife crisis she is going through compels her to go days and days and days without washing her hair and keys her up to fly off the handle at any given moment, spewing forth her bitterness at all the jerks and idiots in the world.  Olivia has problems of her own; it's not that she's a maid, it's the fact that she is still hung up on this rascal of a married man who dumped her, has no direction in life, enjoys smoking pot, and is basically just floundering.  She's not helpless by any means, but she is a real mess.  Her friends, naturally enough, think she needs a man.As Friends With Money approached the final turn and headed for the home stretch, I consciously wondered where this story was ultimately going - the answer, of course, is nowhere.  There is no true sense of conclusion to any of the film's sub-plots.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it represents a definite vision on the part of the director.  One could also say it makes sense because all we have really done is step into these characters' lives for a brief time.  We see it all, though - their doubts, their fears, their discontentment and anger, everything.  Jane tends to steal the show with her increasingly grungy appearance and frequent hissy fits, but all of these characters and their many and varied problems will doubtlessly strike many a chord with viewers.  Christine's marital problems are especially relevant to many a married couple today, and I'm sure I'm not the only person in the world who can somewhat identify with Olivia's general malaise and lack of purpose.I really haven't done a good job describing this movie, partly because Friends With Money just doesn't lend itself to easy explanation.

645199,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JP28,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 6]","It's a great treat to see four solid actresses work together in such a naturalistic manner that focuses on the subtlety of their characterizations. At the same time, it's rather frustrating to track their stories as they are presented in such an episodic fashion in the absence of a real storyline. Writer-director Nicole Holofcener is at her best when capturing the camaraderie that develops among women whose friendship is forged by initial similarities in their lifestyles but challenged by their evolving differences. It comes as no surprise that she has directed episodes of ""Sex in the City"" and ""Gilmore Girls"".The movie focuses on four women - Franny, the wealthiest and most happily married, whose chief concern is that her husband spend too much money on their kids; Christine, a screenwriter whose professional success lies in the writing partnership she has with her insensitive husband and whose personal state is as precarious as the renovations they make to their home; Jane, the owner of a thriving, high-end clothing company whose metrosexual husband inadvertently seems to feed into her self-loathing; and the odd one of the bunch, Olivia, a one-time schoolteacher low on both funds and self-esteem and relegated to becoming a maid-for-hire. Olivia is younger than the other three who all feel a different begrudging need to address her personal and financial situation. Olivia's odyssey includes a humiliating relationship with Franny's self-absorbed personal trainer Mike and ultimately a match-up with one of her clients, an unemployed sad-sack named Marty.The acting is the chief draw here, and the stellar cast is headed by a surprisingly assured Jennifer Aniston as Olivia. In her best work since the adulterous store clerk in Miguel Arleta's ""The Good Girl"", she plays her character unapologetically with a beguiling mix of vulnerability and manipulation. We are drawn to her not because she is the star but because she represents the most unpredictable dynamic to the group. As Christine, Catherine Keener, Holofcener's constant muse, is terrifically sharp and frustrating as she desperately tries to cajole her husband out of his indifference, even allowing her house to become a neighborhood eyesore with their self-indulgent additions. With more than her share of showy moments, Frances McDormand is in fighting form as Jane whether tearing down an acquaintance for taking her parking space or melting down for a slight she experiences at Old Navy. Joan Cusack's Franny makes good use of the actress's slightly out-of-kilter personality, though the role seems more like a becalmed counterpoint to the more heated travails of the other friends.The men fare well in decidedly second-tier roles with stand-out work by Simon McBurney as Jane's sexually ambiguous, style-conscious husband Aaron and Scott Caan at his smarmiest as user extraordinaire Mike. I just wish the movie had more of a story to tell and less of a dragging momentum that feels like a piling of details with no real resolution. The realistic tone set forth by Holofcener is filled with so many layers of self-loathing that it starts to feel repetitive and a bit wearing by the end. The charity dinner seems to act as the dramatic climax of the film, but it leaves me wanting more.",3,Smart Performances and Realistic Camaraderie Keep Episodic Story of Self-Loathing Afloat,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,3275,"['great', 'treat', 'see', 'four', 'solid', 'actresses', 'work', 'together', 'such', 'naturalistic', 'manner', 'subtlety', 'characterizations', 'same', 'time', 'rather', 'frustrating', 'track', 'stories', 'are', 'presented', 'such', 'episodic', 'fashion', 'absence', 'real', 'storyline', 'Writer-director', 'Nicole', 'Holofcener', 'best', 'when', 'capturing', 'camaraderie', 'women', 'friendship', 'forged', 'initial', 'similarities', 'lifestyles', 'challenged', 'evolving', 'differences', 'surprise', 'directed', 'episodes', 'Sex', 'City', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', '.The', 'movie', 'four', 'women', 'Franny', 'wealthiest', 'most', 'happily', 'married', 'chief', 'concern', 'husband', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'kids', 'Christine', 'screenwriter', 'professional', 'success', 'writing', 'partnership', 'insensitive', 'husband', 'personal', 'state', 'as', 'precarious', 'renovations', 'make', 'home', 'Jane', 'owner', 'thriving', 'high-end', 'clothing', 'company', 'metrosexual', 'husband', 'inadvertently', 'feed', 'self-loathing', 'odd', 'one', 'bunch', 'Olivia', 'one-time', 'schoolteacher', 'low', 'funds', 'self-esteem', 'relegated', 'becoming', 'maid-for-hire', 'Olivia', 'younger', 'other', 'three', 'who', 'feel', 'different', 'begrudging', 'need', 'address', 'personal', 'financial', 'situation', 'Olivia', 'odyssey', 'humiliating', 'relationship', 'Franny', 'self-absorbed', 'personal', 'trainer', 'Mike', 'ultimately', 'match-up', 'one', 'clients', 'unemployed', 'sad-sack', 'named', 'Marty.The', 'acting', 'chief', 'draw', 'here', 'stellar', 'cast', 'headed', 'surprisingly', 'assured', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Olivia', 'best', 'work', 'adulterous', 'store', 'clerk', 'Miguel', 'Arleta', 'Good', 'Girl', 'character', 'unapologetically', 'beguiling', 'mix', 'vulnerability', 'manipulation', 'are', 'drawn', 'not', 'star', 'most', 'unpredictable', 'dynamic', 'group', 'Christine', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Holofcener', 'constant', 'muse', 'terrifically', 'sharp', 'frustrating', 'desperately', 'cajole', 'husband', 'indifference', 'even', 'allowing', 'house', 'become', 'neighborhood', 'eyesore', 'self-indulgent', 'additions', 'more', 'share', 'showy', 'moments', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'fighting', 'form', 'Jane', 'tearing', 'down', 'acquaintance', 'taking', 'parking', 'space', 'melting', 'down', 'slight', 'Old', 'Navy', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Franny', 'good', 'use', 'actress', 'slightly', 'out-of-kilter', 'personality', 'role', 'more', 'becalmed', 'counterpoint', 'more', 'heated', 'travails', 'other', 'friends.The', 'men', 'fare', 'well', 'decidedly', 'second-tier', 'roles', 'stand-out', 'work', 'Simon', 'McBurney', 'Jane', 'sexually', 'ambiguous', 'style-conscious', 'husband', 'Aaron', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'smarmiest', 'user', 'extraordinaire', 'Mike', 'just', 'wish', 'movie', 'had', 'more', 'story', 'tell', 'less', 'dragging', 'momentum', 'piling', 'details', 'real', 'resolution', 'realistic', 'tone', 'set', 'forth', 'Holofcener', 'filled', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'self-loathing', 'feel', 'repetitive', 'bit', 'wearing', 'end', 'charity', 'dinner', 'act', 'dramatic', 'climax', 'film', 'wanting', 'more']",N/A

645201,A2BPDFR58H9575,B00005JP28,Galina,"[3, 7]","Set in Los Angeles, Nicole Holofcener's third movie (also Walking and Talking,1996 and Lovely & Amazing, 2001)  examines the lives of four women friends who are approaching early middle age: married and financially secure Jane (Frances McDormand), Franny (Joan Cusack) and Christine (Catherine Keener), and their single friend Olivia (Jennifer Aniston). Despite the financial security and families, the wealthy women get so tired, loud, and miserable that broke and single Olivia (Jennifer Anniston) seems a normal person in comparison. Olivia used to be a teacher at one of the prestigious high schools of Santa Monica but she got frustrated with the arrogance and mean jokes from her privileged students. She left teaching and became a maid. Her love life is non-existent and she is a pothead. Becoming a maid did not make her happy as well as money and wealth did not make her friends happy and optimistic either. Olivia's story was the most interesting one, and as it is supposed to be in romantic dramedy, Olivia may meet the right man (or will she?) and even become a friend with money, too.As in many modern independent movies, the characters of ""Friends with Money"" examinine their lives, the insecurities and fears of getting older, the relationships with their spouses, and they often feel sorry for themselves and unfulfilled. Money can't by you love or happiness or feeling of belonging - we all know that and sadly, the movie did not say anything new or original on the old subject. While the acting is uniformly good (and we would not expect something different from the cast like this), the story is weak, the characters are often irritating and not convincing at why exactly they are so unhappy. It applies first to wonderful Frances McDormand's Jane, the very successful clothes designer whose husband loves her and wants another child with her. Jane is obviously suffering from depression to the point that she does not wash her hair for weeks, and we've been reminded about this fact over and over. I feel that it could be an interesting story here but it just went nowhere. Catherine Keener, Nicole Holofcener's regular actress, (they've made three movies together) is lovely and amazing as usual. I love her acting ability, her screen presence, the irony that covers her character's sadness, and disappointments, but she did not help to elevate this movie to above average level. Neither Joan Cusack did, another amazing talent, great combination of comical and compelling. Three excellent actresses did not have much to work with in this material.

645202,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JP28,Grady Harp,"[1, 3]","Nicole Holofcener has a take on everyday life today that relies more on simply dropping in on conversations among diverse friends and allowing those conversations to create a story.  In FRIENDS WITH MONEY she has written and directed a smart film that admirably allows us to sit back and watch some very gifted actors at work.The friends with money include Franny (Joan Cusack) whose main concerns are being a housewife/mother and figuring out how to give money to which charity function and pass spending by her husband Matt (Greg Germann); Christine (Catherine Keener) who is co-writing  a screenplay with husband David (Jason Isaacs) in an act which mirrors deeper problems with their relationship; and Jane (Frances McDormand) who is bitter, refuses to wash her hair, has conflicts with nearly everyone she meets, and is married to a gender vague husband Aaron (Simon McBurney) who loves Jane but also is attracted to men.  The fourth member of the quartet of friends is Olivia (Jennifer Aniston), a sad ex-teacher who makes her living as a maid and is decidedly the friend without money.  The story involves intermittent crises among these couples, with Olivia being the victim role the other three try to correct, first by setting her up with Franny's Personal Trainer Mike (Scott Caan), a manipulative user, then thwarting her requests for a loan to become a personal trainer.  The most unlikely match develops between Olivia's 'cheapskate' employer Marty (Bob Stephenson) who, while unattractive and on the surface is undesirable, happens to be the only happy door that opens for Olivia.The quartet of women selected to portray these friends is one of the happiest surprises of the year: Aniston, McDormand, Keener, and Cusack prove they are some of our best actors on screen today.  And the men are equally fine.  This is a cerebral movie, one that may seem to drag at times because of the intentional lack of a story thread, but it is one this viewer will watch repeatedly because of the timely dialogue and the consummate skill with which it is delivered!

She is the friend with NO money. While on a blind date with a personal trainer, her date sees someone he claims to have known from high school. He spends much of his time talking to this other woman. When Aniston is ready to leave in a huff, he stops her and accompanies her along to her next appointment. When they're finished, he insists on getting a cut because he ""helped"" by dusting a shelf or two. The guy is a creep, and that Aniston goes out with him again and again, and continues to give him part of her hard earned money, says much of her own largely unexplained self hatred.Franny (Cusack) is a wealthy homemaker with an active sex life and a husband who likes to help her spend her money. She's the only one who isn't entirely dysfunctional, but the lack of passion in her husbands voice hints at a deeper darkness.Christine (Keener) barely recognizes her husband's existence, and he returns the favor as consciously as she offers it. Their relationship is the oddest, for they are writers - collaborators - and writing is an intensely personal experience. Collaborating with another person takes extraordinary care and patience. How these two ever did anything together to produce even moderate wealth is beyond belief.Jane (McDormand) is a 43-year-old successful designer who is, according to Christine, married to a gay man. In reality, her husband is just plain Aaron - the effeminate heterosexual. She is, throughout the film, engrossed in rage. One item of note here: their son in the film looks like he might be a product of Jane and Aaron. Too often in films, you'll find a blond haired blue eyed child with parents who have brown hair and mismatched eyes.It's difficult to imagine Jane, Christine, Franny and Olivia ever being friends. The three ""with money"" are all ten or more years older than Aniston in real life, and they look even older. Aniston, at 38, can still pass herself off as being in her 20s, so I was very surprised at the casting decisions. We weren't given any real background on the genesis of their friendships, but three 40-something women don't adopt a 30-something woman and then treat her as if she's been there all along. It was confusing.There's a lot to work with here, but I feel as if much of it was left in the editing room floor, or simply never made it into the script. Why is Olivia consumed with self-hatred? Why is Jane so remarkably depressed, and what is the source of her anger? (She doesn't think Aaron is gay - and neither do we.) What brought Christine and her husband to this point, and how did they ever get anything done?Why are they friends? (That's a question that should be able to be answered simply by observation. I didn't see it.)",3,Not a comedy,1174867200,"03 26, 2007",2007,3069,"['many', 'was', 'not', 'alone', 'finding', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'lacking', 'Frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'once', 'Rather', 'was', 'morbidly', 'intrigued', 'vast', 'dysfunction', 'portrayed', 'characters.Oliva', 'Aniston', 'former', 'teacher', 'turned', 'pot-smoking', 'maid', 'who', 'hung', 'up', 'last', 'relationship', 'two-month', 'fling', 'mildly', 'attractive', 'married', 'man', 'friend', 'money', 'blind', 'date', 'personal', 'trainer', 'date', 'someone', 'have', 'known', 'high', 'school', 'much', 'time', 'talking', 'other', 'woman', 'When', 'Aniston', 'ready', 'leave', 'huff', 'along', 'next', 'appointment', 'When', ""'re"", 'finished', 'getting', 'cut', 'helped', 'dusting', 'shelf', 'two', 'guy', 'creep', 'Aniston', 'out', 'again', 'again', 'give', 'part', 'hard', 'earned', 'money', 'much', 'own', 'largely', 'unexplained', 'self', 'hatred.Franny', 'Cusack', 'wealthy', 'homemaker', 'active', 'sex', 'life', 'husband', 'who', 'help', 'spend', 'money', 'only', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'dysfunctional', 'lack', 'passion', 'husbands', 'voice', 'hints', 'deeper', 'darkness.Christine', 'Keener', 'barely', 'husband', 'existence', 'favor', 'as', 'consciously', 'relationship', 'oddest', 'are', 'writers', 'collaborators', 'writing', 'intensely', 'personal', 'experience', 'Collaborating', 'person', 'extraordinary', 'care', 'patience', 'How', 'two', 'ever', 'did', 'anything', 'together', 'produce', 'even', 'moderate', 'wealth', 'belief.Jane', 'McDormand', '43-year-old', 'successful', 'designer', 'who', 'according', 'Christine', 'married', 'gay', 'man', 'reality', 'husband', 'just', 'plain', 'Aaron', 'effeminate', 'heterosexual', 'film', 'engrossed', 'rage', 'One', 'item', 'note', 'here', 'son', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'product', 'Jane', 'Aaron', 'Too', 'often', 'films', ""'ll"", 'find', 'blond', 'haired', 'blue', 'eyed', 'child', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'brown', 'hair', 'mismatched', 'eyes.It', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'Jane', 'Christine', 'Franny', 'Olivia', 'ever', 'being', 'friends', 'three', 'money', 'are', 'ten', 'more', 'years', 'older', 'Aniston', 'real', 'life', 'look', 'even', 'older', 'Aniston', '38', 'can', 'still', 'pass', 'off', 'being', '20s', 'so', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'casting', 'decisions', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'real', 'background', 'genesis', 'friendships', 'three', '40-something', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'adopt', '30-something', 'woman', 'then', 'treat', 'been', 'there', 'along', 'was', 'lot', 'work', 'here', 'feel', 'much', 'was', 'left', 'editing', 'room', 'floor', 'simply', 'never', 'made', 'script', 'Why', 'Olivia', 'consumed', 'self-hatred', 'Why', 'Jane', 'so', 'remarkably', 'depressed', 'what', 'source', 'anger', ""n't"", 'think', 'Aaron', 'gay', 'neither', 'do', 'What', 'brought', 'Christine', 'husband', 'point', 'how', 'did', 'ever', 'get', 'anything', 'done', 'Why', 'are', 'friends', 'question', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'answered', 'simply', 'observation', 'did', ""n't"", 'see']",N/A

645209,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B00005JP28,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[1, 5]","Friends With Money is exactly what it says in the title.  A story about a group of friends, centered around Jennifer Aniston's character, Olivia.  Though all of her friends have successful careers, Olivia is working as a maid and supplementing her meager income with free samples from department stores and filched items from her clients.  Olivia is the only unsuccessful member of a group of friends made up of three sets of power couples, and she stands out like a sore thumb.  As one friend is quick to point out she is unmarried, a pothead, and a maid.  She neglects to add: a pushover, unmotivated, and lonely.I liked this movie, but I didn't love it like I did Holofcener's previous film Lovely and Amazing.  There was enough star power behind this film including Joan Cusack, Frances McDormand, and Catherine Keener, that I expected a bit more than what I got.  The story was cut apart and pasted together in a way that made it difficult to get to know any of the characters really well and the story seemed unfinished to me.However, I found McDormand's character, a clothing designer who is getting misanthropic in her old age, refreshing in a sea of people who are constantly upbeat and happy.  Her breakdown in an Old Navy store alone is worth watching this movie.  Also, this is the only Aniston film I've seen in awhile where she wasn't playing Rachel again. If you've seen Rumor Has It or Along Came Polly, I think you know what I mean.  Overall, I found Friends With Money humorous, enjoyable, and not a bad way to pass an hour and a half.

Bernabo,"[2, 4]","Watching ""Friends with Money"" turned out to be a disappointment, mainly because my expectations were so high given the quality of the cast.  A movie that brings together Frances McDormand, Joan Cusack, Catherine Keener, and Jennifer Aniston is going to get your attention, and what I was hoping for was something like the first season of ""Desperate Housewives,"" not so much in terms of plot or characters, but simply in terms of having the sort of performances where four actresses are all competing for the same acting awards.  But ""Friends with Money"" is not that kind of movie and the trailer certainly does not suggest the sort of movie you end up seeing.This 2006 movie is about four women who have been friends for pretty much forever.  Jane (McDormand) is in the throes of what might be described as pre-menopausal angst, which has her reading the riot act to people who take her parking spot or place in line at the checkout counter.  Jane is married to Aaron (Simon McBurney) and she might be the only person who does not think Aaron is gay.  Franny (Cusack) is concerned with how much money is being spent on shoes for her growing daughter, which appears to be the most significant event in her life, along with the upcoming charity event (for ALS and not the homeless).  She is married to Matt (Greg Germann), who can explain why growing children need substantial support for their feet.  Christine (Keener) writes screenplays with her husband David (Jason Isaacs) in tag-team fashion, but the fight their characters were having has shifted to their own fight while construction works are building an audition to their house.All of these characters are married and rich, and that makes Olivia (Aniston), who is single and relatively poor, stand out like a sore thumb when they all get together.  Olivia used to teach high school juniors at a school in Santa Monica, but that was not her calling, and now she is working as a maid, although she is thinking about becoming a personal physical therapist.  Olivia still gets to hang out with her friends on fancy occasions, who are worried about her, and with good reason.  When she is not calling the phone of the married man with whom she had a two-month affair and hanging up with his wife answers, she is spending time with Mike (Scott Caan), who tags along with her when she is working and figures he deserves a cut on the money she makes.""Friends With Money"" was written and directed by Nicole Holofcener, who is not able to build upon her previous successes, 1996's ""Walking and Talking"" and 2001's ""Lovely and Amazing,"" both of which starred Keener.  When the credits starting rolling and you realize this is only an 88-minute film, that limitation looms large in trying to put a finger on why this film is not all it should be.  Half of the four women come to significant crossroads, while a third might be close to one if certain implications bear out.  That leaves one woman for whom the lack of crossroads might serve as a contrast to what is happening with the rest.  So there is some sense of having come to a point where the movie can end, but I am still convinced that there should have been more.  Listening to the special features on this DVD you can see how excited these actresses were to play these roles only brings me back to the high expectations I had for this movie in the first place and I cannot help but think that if this had been the pilot for a television series I would think more of it, because that would have the attendant promise of there being more.",3,"A great cast and interesting characters, but the plot does not measure up to them",1157068800,"09 1, 2006",2006,3543,"['Watching', 'Friends', 'Money', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'disappointment', 'mainly', 'expectations', 'were', 'so', 'high', 'given', 'quality', 'cast', 'movie', 'together', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'going', 'get', 'attention', 'what', 'was', 'hoping', 'was', 'something', 'first', 'season', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'terms', 'plot', 'characters', 'simply', 'terms', 'having', 'sort', 'performances', 'where', 'four', 'actresses', 'are', 'competing', 'same', 'acting', 'awards', 'Friends', 'Money', 'not', 'kind', 'movie', 'trailer', 'certainly', 'not', 'suggest', 'sort', 'movie', 'end', 'up', 'seeing.This', '2006', 'movie', 'four', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'pretty', 'much', 'forever', 'Jane', 'McDormand', 'throes', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'described', 'pre-menopausal', 'angst', 'reading', 'riot', 'act', 'people', 'who', 'take', 'parking', 'spot', 'place', 'line', 'checkout', 'counter', 'Jane', 'married', 'Aaron', 'Simon', 'McBurney', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'not', 'think', 'Aaron', 'gay', 'Franny', 'Cusack', 'concerned', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'being', 'spent', 'shoes', 'growing', 'daughter', 'be', 'most', 'significant', 'event', 'life', 'upcoming', 'charity', 'event', 'ALS', 'not', 'homeless', 'married', 'Matt', 'Greg', 'Germann', 'who', 'can', 'explain', 'why', 'growing', 'children', 'need', 'substantial', 'support', 'feet', 'Christine', 'Keener', 'screenplays', 'husband', 'David', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'tag-team', 'fashion', 'fight', 'characters', 'were', 'having', 'shifted', 'own', 'fight', 'construction', 'works', 'are', 'building', 'audition', 'house.All', 'characters', 'are', 'married', 'rich', 'Olivia', 'Aniston', 'who', 'single', 'relatively', 'poor', 'stand', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'when', 'get', 'together', 'Olivia', 'used', 'teach', 'high', 'school', 'juniors', 'school', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'was', 'not', 'calling', 'now', 'working', 'maid', 'thinking', 'becoming', 'personal', 'physical', 'therapist', 'Olivia', 'still', 'hang', 'out', 'friends', 'fancy', 'occasions', 'who', 'are', 'worried', 'good', 'reason', 'When', 'not', 'calling', 'phone', 'married', 'man', 'whom', 'had', 'two-month', 'affair', 'hanging', 'up', 'wife', 'answers', 'spending', 'time', 'Mike', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'who', 'along', 'when', 'working', 'figures', 'cut', 'money', 'Friends', 'Money', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Nicole', 'Holofcener', 'who', 'not', 'able', 'build', 'previous', 'successes', '1996', 'Walking', 'Talking', '2001', 'Lovely', 'Amazing', 'starred', 'Keener', 'When', 'credits', 'starting', 'rolling', 'realize', 'only', '88-minute', 'film', 'limitation', 'large', 'trying', 'put', 'finger', 'why', 'film', 'not', 'should', 'be', 'Half', 'four', 'women', 'come', 'significant', 'crossroads', 'third', 'might', 'be', 'close', 'one', 'certain', 'implications', 'bear', 'out', 'one', 'woman', 'whom', 'lack', 'crossroads', 'might', 'serve', 'contrast', 'what', 'happening', 'rest', 'sense', 'having', 'come', 'point', 'where', 'movie', 'can', 'end', 'am', 'still', 'convinced', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'Listening', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'excited', 'actresses', 'were', 'play', 'roles', 'only', 'back', 'high', 'expectations', 'had', 'movie', 'first', 'place', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'had', 'been', 'pilot', 'television', 'series', 'would', 'think', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'attendant', 'promise', 'being', 'more']",N/A

Jennifer Anniston who won a Golden Globe as Best Actress in a comedy series for ""Friends"" plays Olivia who got so upset teaching rich kids in a private school that she quit to clean people's houses.  She wishes her rich school friends would front her tuition money so she can become a licensed physical trainer, even though she personally hates the gym.  Catherine Keener who had Best Supporting Actress Oscar nominations for ""Being John Malkovich"" & ""Capote,"" does a good job as Christine, a woman who is not loved by her screenwriting partner husband.  As Keener's screen hubby Patrick, John Isaacs from ""Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire"" & ""Peter Pan"" does an excellent job at being an unfeeling jerk.  As they add a second story to their house that wrecks the view for all of their neighbors, we see the conflict between Christine caring about her neighbors and Patrick not caring.  Frances McDormand, the Best Actress Oscar winner for ""Fargo,"" as Jane is a dress designer married to a husband that most of her friends think is gay.  She is severely depressed and refuses to wash her hair.  Simon McBurney as her husband is a bit of a twit, but doesn't particularly seem to be attracted to the series of gay guys who ogle him.  He will soon be seen in ""The Last King of Scotland,"" a picture about Uganda & Idi Amin.  Joan Cusack is wonderful comedienne with two Best Supporting Actress nominations for ""In & Out"" & ""Working Girl.""  She plays Franny, the rich socialite who admits that she wouldn't be a friend with Olivia if she hadn't met her in college.  Her husband Matt is played stoically by Greg German of Ally McBeal fame.  Director Nicole Holofcener has done little to enhance this atrocious screenplay.

645214,A2UJ8CMLTWLVXY,B00005JP28,Leslie Halpern,"[6, 6]","In ""Friends With Money,"" writer-director Nicole Holofcener's third feature film, Jennifer Aniston plays a drab, depressed character without a husband, without a promising future, and (as the title implies) without any money.  The film is promoted as an ensemble piece which includes Catherine Keener, Frances McDormand, and Joan Cusack as three long-time friends of Olivia (Aniston's downtrodden teacher now working as a maid).  However, ""Friends With Money"" begins with Olivia's story, centers around developments in her personal life, and ends with a possibility (rather than a promise) for her future.Christine (Keener) realizes that she and her husband - screenwriting collaborators - don't communicate anymore.  Confronted by her own mortality and a strikingly effeminate husband, fashion designer Jane (McDormand) fears that she's losing control.  On the other hand, Frannie (Cusack) is happily married and independently wealthy, and has no significant worries except the basic inconveniences of daily existence.We get to view these tangled relationships from every angle, and are privy to conversations between the four women, between two of the women gossiping about the others, between the individual couples, between friends and clients,  between friends and lovers (or past/potential lovers), between the men, and various combinations of all of the above.  It may be complicated keeping track, but it's certainly lots of fun.Honestly written and sensitively portrayed, this movie reveals the comedy and drama of modern couples in Los Angeles trying to work things out, but ""Friends With Money"" shares the triumphs and frustrations of middle-aged women everywhere as they come to terms with their social, personal, familial, and sexual status in life.Leslie Halpern, author ofReel Romance: The Lovers' Guide to the 100 Best Date MoviesandDreams on Film: The Cinematic Struggle Between Art and Science.",4,An Interesting Ensemble Piece,1168560000,"01 12, 2007",2007,1911,"['Friends', 'Money', 'writer-director', 'Nicole', 'Holofcener', 'third', 'feature', 'film', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'drab', 'depressed', 'character', 'husband', 'promising', 'future', 'title', 'implies', 'money', 'film', 'promoted', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'three', 'long-time', 'friends', 'Olivia', 'Aniston', 'downtrodden', 'teacher', 'now', 'working', 'maid', 'However', 'Friends', 'Money', 'Olivia', 'story', 'centers', 'developments', 'personal', 'life', 'possibility', 'rather', 'promise', 'future.Christine', 'Keener', 'husband', 'screenwriting', 'collaborators', 'do', ""n't"", 'communicate', 'anymore', 'Confronted', 'own', 'mortality', 'strikingly', 'effeminate', 'husband', 'fashion', 'designer', 'Jane', 'McDormand', 'losing', 'control', 'other', 'hand', 'Frannie', 'Cusack', 'happily', 'married', 'independently', 'wealthy', 'significant', 'worries', 'basic', 'inconveniences', 'daily', 'existence.We', 'get', 'view', 'tangled', 'relationships', 'angle', 'are', 'privy', 'conversations', 'four', 'women', 'two', 'women', 'gossiping', 'others', 'individual', 'couples', 'friends', 'clients', 'friends', 'lovers', 'past/potential', 'lovers', 'men', 'various', 'combinations', 'above', 'may', 'be', 'complicated', 'keeping', 'track', 'certainly', 'lots', 'fun.Honestly', 'written', 'sensitively', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'comedy', 'drama', 'modern', 'couples', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'trying', 'work', 'things', 'out', 'Friends', 'Money', 'shares', 'triumphs', 'frustrations', 'middle-aged', 'women', 'everywhere', 'come', 'terms', 'social', 'personal', 'familial', 'sexual', 'status', 'life.Leslie', 'Halpern', 'author', 'ofReel', 'Romance', 'Lovers', 'Guide', '100', 'Best', 'Date', 'MoviesandDreams', 'Film', 'Cinematic', 'Struggle', 'Between', 'Art', 'Science']",N/A

It's a really nice film - a comedy/drama that is enjoyable and probably much more of a chick flick.  It's only a little under one and a half hours long but it still packs a punch within that time.  I like the settings of LA and the Santa Monica area, it's beautiful and I also think the film works because of the supporting cast.

Typical is a scene where Catherine Keener's character burns herself and her husband doesn't ask if she's okay.

Southern California, recently, seems to be made up of ""have-mores."" as George W. Bush would put it, and have-nots. The have-nots (Jennifer Aniston's role) want to have the good life just as much as the have-mores, hence she collects expensive cosmetic samples from every department store in town because she can't afford to buy the expensive things herself. The have-mores are oblivious to the suffering and lack around them, relying on low-paid workers from Mexico to do their house renovations, care for their kids, and clean their houses. A great scene that reveals this is when one of the have-mores decides it is selfish to renovate her house and steal her neighbor's ocean view, and runs up to tell the Mexican workers to ""stop work. No work, amigos. Go home,"" unconcerned with the fact that they are halfway through the job and most likely need the work.The have-mores are so busy trying to make themselves look good, that they are also oblivious to their own faults and the problems in their marriages.

It wasn't particularly funny (as the trailer led me to believe); in fact it was rather painful at times.  I thought the acting was terrific, though, even from Aniston, who I don't particularly like. (It was the other actresses who brought me in.) I did think some of the writing was spot-on (the blind date scene was priceless) and I think part of what I didn't like was that some of the situations the characters find themselves in mirrored my own life a little too closely and that was why the film bothered me.  I also felt that some of the men's parts were very underwritten and a little thankless. (Particularly Scott Caan and Jason Isaacs, both good actors who deserve better written parts.)  I felt that the whole movie was from the women characters' point of view and I would have liked a little more background on the men and their take on what was going on in the various relationships.  I realize the movie is supposed to focus on the women, but it just felt really unbalanced to me.  (I'm female.)  I thought Frances McDormand was great, but then she always is.  Ditto Catherine Keener.  Overall, I'd recommend this as a rental but with the caveat that it won't appeal to everyone.  It's not a happy film and you probably won't like it if you like movies where everything is tied up neatly at the end.  I think it could have used a rewrite and some fleshing out of some scenes and maybe a little back story on some of the relationships.

I decided to take a chance on her anyway, and needless to say, after almost two hours of the useless ""Friends with Money"", I was left wondering exactly why Aniston even has a film career. What is so special about her? I loved her as Rachel on ""Friends"", but seriously, its as if she plays that very same role here, except with a different name.Anistons' pathetic acting skills are not the only thing wrong with this film. I blame the horrendous script. Whoever wrote the script should give up any dreams of A-List Hollywood stardom. Most of the text looks like its directly from some half-hearted off-Broadway play (and not in a good way). The most stifling and contrived lines are presented to us - only you or I would probably never meet people who speak this way. In his attempt to 'humanize' the L.A wealth-club, the director only succeeds in making them look even more cartoonish and inaccessible.The four women in this story are all self-centered, but in the classic ""Waiting to Exhale"" tradition, we are expected to sympathize with all of them and blame their husbands instead. In fact, I personally thought that all of the male characters were painted very negatively. One woman is supposedly married to a closeted male, and I thought this particular storyline was handled in the most ridiculous possible manner. The woman is on the verge of a nervous breakdown possibly because she suspects her husband is in denial about his sexuality. Only we, the audience, and everyone in the cast is already well aware of his sexuality. The poor woman should have just moved on with her life. Instead, they end the film still together - I don't see how this could have even been possible in the real world unless both people in the relationship were completely in denial and also deranged. Still, this is a movie, and if I can buy rats cooking French nouveau cuisine in ""Ratatouille"", I may as well accept this.Jennifer Anistons' character actually doesn't have much screen time. She looks terrible here, even more dogged than usual, as if she didn't bother taking care of herself anymore. In an attempt to make her life seem 'real', she is placed in some very idiotic situations (her first date, for example), and eventually the guy she ends up with is supposed to warm our heart - only he looks like a serial killer / axe murderer all rolled into one, so when the end credits rolled I was quite worried for the Aniston character.Granted this is not a happy movie. Its not a sad one either. In fact, it is about nothingness. And if the director intended it to be this way, by all means she has done a fantastic job. The worst decision the film crew made was to cast Jennifer Aniston as the lead character. I remember watching ""Derailed"" and so wanted to give Jen another chance, but she let me down there. Here, she is as neurotic and Rachel-y as ever, and it does not do anything for the character.""Friends with Money"" is one of those independent films that you should skip. There are far better independent films out there, more deserving of your consideration and your time. In the meantime, thanks to the filmmakers for opening my eyes to the fact that Jennifer Aniston can and never will be a good actress. As much as I liked her in ""Friends"", this was the final nail in her acting coffin. Watch it to understand what I'm talking about.Two Generous Stars. And I think both of them should go to Joan Cusack who is just luminous. She alone rises above the tepid subject matter, though she gives her character far more personality than a film of this low caliber deserves.",2,The Slow Descent of Jennifer Aniston,1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,3654,"['movie', 'headlining', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'warning', 'enough', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', 'anyway', 'needless', 'say', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'useless', 'Friends', 'Money', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'exactly', 'why', 'Aniston', 'even', 'film', 'career', 'What', 'so', 'special', 'loved', 'Rachel', 'Friends', 'seriously', 'very', 'same', 'role', 'here', 'different', 'name.Anistons', 'pathetic', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'wrong', 'film', 'blame', 'horrendous', 'script', 'wrote', 'script', 'should', 'give', 'up', 'dreams', 'A-List', 'Hollywood', 'stardom', 'Most', 'text', 'directly', 'half-hearted', 'off-Broadway', 'play', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'most', 'stifling', 'contrived', 'lines', 'are', 'presented', 'only', 'would', 'probably', 'never', 'meet', 'people', 'who', 'speak', 'way', 'attempt', ""'humanize"", 'L.A', 'wealth-club', 'director', 'only', 'making', 'look', 'even', 'more', 'cartoonish', 'inaccessible.The', 'four', 'women', 'story', 'are', 'self-centered', 'classic', 'Waiting', 'Exhale', 'tradition', 'are', 'expected', 'sympathize', 'blame', 'husbands', 'instead', 'fact', 'personally', 'thought', 'male', 'characters', 'were', 'painted', 'very', 'negatively', 'One', 'woman', 'supposedly', 'married', 'closeted', 'male', 'thought', 'particular', 'storyline', 'was', 'handled', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'possible', 'manner', 'woman', 'verge', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'possibly', 'husband', 'denial', 'sexuality', 'Only', 'audience', 'everyone', 'cast', 'already', 'well', 'aware', 'sexuality', 'poor', 'woman', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'moved', 'life', 'Instead', 'end', 'film', 'still', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'possible', 'real', 'world', 'people', 'relationship', 'were', 'completely', 'denial', 'also', 'deranged', 'Still', 'movie', 'can', 'buy', 'rats', 'cooking', 'French', 'nouveau', 'cuisine', 'Ratatouille', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'this.Jennifer', 'Anistons', 'character', 'actually', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'terrible', 'here', 'even', 'more', 'dogged', 'usual', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'taking', 'care', 'herself', 'anymore', 'attempt', 'make', 'life', 'seem', ""'real"", 'placed', 'very', 'idiotic', 'situations', 'first', 'date', 'example', 'eventually', 'guy', 'up', 'supposed', 'warm', 'heart', 'only', 'serial', 'killer', '/', 'murderer', 'rolled', 'one', 'so', 'when', 'end', 'rolled', 'was', 'quite', 'worried', 'Aniston', 'character.Granted', 'not', 'happy', 'movie', 'not', 'sad', 'one', 'fact', 'nothingness', 'director', 'intended', 'be', 'way', 'means', 'done', 'fantastic', 'job', 'worst', 'decision', 'film', 'crew', 'made', 'was', 'cast', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'lead', 'character', 'remember', 'watching', 'Derailed', 'so', 'wanted', 'give', 'Jen', 'chance', 'let', 'down', 'there', 'Here', 'neurotic', 'Rachel-y', 'ever', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'character', 'Friends', 'Money', 'one', 'independent', 'films', 'should', 'skip', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'independent', 'films', 'there', 'more', 'deserving', 'consideration', 'time', 'meantime', 'thanks', 'filmmakers', 'opening', 'eyes', 'fact', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'can', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'actress', 'As', 'much', 'liked', 'Friends', 'was', 'final', 'nail', 'acting', 'coffin', 'Watch', 'understand', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'about.Two', 'Generous', 'Stars', 'think', 'should', 'go', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'who', 'just', 'luminous', 'alone', 'rises', 'tepid', 'subject', 'matter', 'character', 'far', 'more', 'personality', 'film', 'low', 'caliber', 'deserves']",N/A

Lots of dialogue.It's good to bring the husbands into the circle, each with their own troubles to deal with. One husband attracts gay men, and everyone seems to think he is gay when he's not; one (played by Jason Isaacs) is trying to keep his relationship with his wife alive, while arguing over petty things; and the other husband is very happy.The ending fails, quite spectacularly, with a very abrupt and inconclusive ending, after a very convenient wrap up of the other characters storylines. The viewer is left feeling rather empty and switching off the DVD player in anger.Joan Cusack plays the same character she plays in every movie, which is very disappointing, it would be nice to see her stretch her wings a bit, but she seems to be stuck in a rut when it comes to choosing scripts.Frances McDormand (Jane) does OK with a role that is very one dimensional - her anger and the reason why she's so angry, is never explained, and the director never bothers to give screen time to penetrating the root of Jane's problems. I thought myself it would be the menopause, having seen my mum go through sort of the same things. Some reviewers have mentioned Jane & her husband's relationship, that they don't seem to have a sex life, but ask any guy if they want to sleep with a woman who was constantly angry, do you think they'd say yes straight away? Her anger results in them not having a love life, but the husband seems unwilling to help her get to the bottom of her problems.Jennifer's character, Olivia, seems to bounce from meaningless relationship to meaningless relationship, from dead end job, to dead end job. Her main relationship that the film focuses on is with a guy who takes money from her from her housecleaning job, and then makes her dress up in a very unsexy maid's outfit, and then takes her to bed. He gets his, she doesn't get hers.The film does focus a lot on relationships, and some of it just doesn't click, like the husband telling his wife she's his best friend, which doesn't seem to ring true. And then there's the meaningless fights, which leads to a seemingly happy couple splitting up. The kids appear briefly, but there is really no point to them being there, and they're not a major part of the film.This is a film that will go nowhere, and will gather dust on your shelves, especially with its sudden ending. Afterwards, it does feel like you've wasted your time, so probably pick up for dead cheap or not all.

In fact, though much of its concerns are humorous, it deals with very serious topics much like those that she dealt with in her previous film ""Lovely and Amazing"" .Once again we are in West Los Angeles among the upwardly mobile with money, Nannies, Housekeepers and men that tend to  lawns and pools.Holofcener, like her East coast counterpart Woody Allen, is part of the scene on which she chooses to comment: she is not an interloper, she is one of them. Holofcener lives and works on the Westside of Los Angeles but she's enough of an artist to step back and objectively survey, comment and analyze all that she sees.""Friends with Money's"" is mainly an Olivia (Jennifer Anniston) concern as she is the house cleaner with friends mostly married and mostly upscale. Jane (a complex and pissed off Frances McDormand), Christine (as a usually conflicted and badly married Catherine Keener) and Franny (a warm hearted Joan Cusack) who are all rich and concerned about Olivia: eager to have her settled down so that they can go on with their lives. All three are alternately self-absorbed, and oblivious to the world around them yet love Olivia enough to care about what happens to her.At her most unglamorous , Anniston makes the most of her role as a woman who is at a loss to make a success of her life: she is both emotionally and socially frozen and her only outlet is her friends...in other words she is lucky to have Jane, Franny and Christine...all of whom support her both emotionally and monetarily.Director Holofcener knows this milieu very well and this transfers to the screen as  compassion and understanding. She does not look down on those she chooses to eviscerate. Instead she steps back and reveals the foibles and fancies of a group of people of whom she feels a deep and thorough understanding. ""Friends with Money"" is a serious, complex and intelligent movie that despite its surface humor is a social and moral comment on par with anything that Woody Allen in his prime has ever committed to film..",4,Amigos,1144368000,"04 7, 2006",2006,2167,"['Contrary', 'what', 'previews', 'trailers', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'Nicole', 'Holofcener', 'third', 'film', 'Friends', 'Money', 'not', 'belly', 'laugh', 'riot', 'fact', 'though', 'much', 'concerns', 'are', 'humorous', 'very', 'serious', 'topics', 'much', 'dealt', 'previous', 'film', 'Lovely', 'Amazing', '.Once', 'again', 'are', 'West', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'upwardly', 'mobile', 'money', 'Nannies', 'Housekeepers', 'men', 'tend', 'lawns', 'pools.Holofcener', 'East', 'coast', 'counterpart', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'part', 'scene', 'comment', 'not', 'interloper', 'one', 'Holofcener', 'Westside', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'enough', 'artist', 'step', 'back', 'objectively', 'survey', 'comment', 'analyze', 'Friends', 'Money', 'mainly', 'Olivia', 'Jennifer', 'Anniston', 'concern', 'house', 'cleaner', 'friends', 'mostly', 'married', 'mostly', 'upscale', 'Jane', 'complex', 'pissed', 'off', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Christine', 'usually', 'conflicted', 'badly', 'married', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Franny', 'warm', 'hearted', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'who', 'are', 'rich', 'concerned', 'Olivia', 'eager', 'have', 'settled', 'down', 'so', 'can', 'go', 'lives', 'three', 'are', 'alternately', 'self-absorbed', 'oblivious', 'world', 'yet', 'love', 'Olivia', 'enough', 'care', 'what', 'her.At', 'most', 'unglamorous', 'Anniston', 'most', 'role', 'woman', 'who', 'loss', 'make', 'success', 'life', 'emotionally', 'socially', 'frozen', 'only', 'outlet', 'friends', 'other', 'words', 'lucky', 'have', 'Jane', 'Franny', 'Christine', 'whom', 'support', 'emotionally', 'monetarily.Director', 'Holofcener', 'milieu', 'very', 'well', 'transfers', 'screen', 'compassion', 'understanding', 'not', 'look', 'down', 'eviscerate', 'Instead', 'back', 'foibles', 'fancies', 'group', 'people', 'whom', 'deep', 'thorough', 'understanding', 'Friends', 'Money', 'serious', 'complex', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'surface', 'humor', 'social', 'moral', 'comment', 'par', 'anything', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'prime', 'ever', 'committed', 'film..']",N/A

In my opinion, this is a good thing!There was a lot of development in the movie, but not much resolution. This can be good or bad depending upon what you are looking for in a movie. I found the ending interesting myself.While the story may not knock your socks off, the portrayal of life in all its complexity just might. This is a movie that will make you think.

I came upon Nicole Holofcener because of her new film, Please Give', which is receiving wonderful reviews, and I wanted to visit all of her films. The characters in her films are so real, it is like we are peeking in through the windows.Jennifer Aniston plays Olivia, a maid. She used to be a teacher in an exclusive school, until the kids started making fun of her. She has friends with money. Jane, played by Frances McDormand, who is an angry byotch, screams at people and is going through some sort of life change. She hasn't washed her hair in weeks, 'you just have to wash it again' she says. And, by the way, she steals every scene she is in. She designs clothes that are overpriced but just wonderful. Christine, played by Catherine Keener, writes screenplays with her husband. They have a difficult relationship to say the least. Franny, played by Joan Cusack, stays at home and is concerned about the amount of money spent on their son's shoes.  All, but Olivia have husbands. Jane's husband is cute and loving but everyone thinks he is Gay, but probably isn't. Christine's husband is the screenwriter, who is less than supportive.  Franny's husband seems the most normal, so we don't know much about him, except he makes a lot of money. The film really centers around Olivia, and this may be one of Jennifer Aniston's best films. She is without glamour, fresh and a pit smoking woman who has no idea who she is or where she is going. Olivia is set up by Jane with Mike a fitness instructor, and, as we soon find out, a louse.  He goes with Olivia and watches her clean house and then expects some financial compensation. Then Olivia meets one of her clients, Marty. He has hired her to clean his house, and he is shy and introverted. But, somehow they strike a chord and we know something will happen. And, as it turns out, they both have, well, issues.The author and director has given us a glimpse into her world. The world of the rich and monied. To have a friend who is a , maid, well it probably is a temporary thing and it is a much needed job, to be a maid. The lives of all of the women are involved and though they are good friends, they are all separate. A world that we can all appreciate from afar. We all wish we had money, but as we learn, money does not buy happiness.A little appreciated film that is a winner.

645237,A3572FTYUQQW3P,B00005JP28,Royce Callaway,"[13, 20]","By way of disclosure I hate the entire deconstructionist movement like the English Patient and this movie is just another example of that genre, which equates to lazy writing and unimaginative plots.This is a movie that has no beginning, no middle, and no end.  It wanders around looking for a plot or a point.  But it does reflect the value system one finds in California in general and Los Angeles in particular.  The movie addresses three marriages and one relationship.  But the people are basically hollow people whose value system rests on material trivialities.  However, this is the value system in LA.  Marriage is not a committment based on love, in fact love isn't even a factor because everyone is focused on themselves.  The typical Hollywood view of life, people, and relationships is that everyone smokes marijuana or takes drugs, this is just a given.  Secondly, people -- even upper class people -- use F**K and S**T for emphasis in lieu of exclamtion points.  Ethnic foods are de rigueur so no one actually eats meat or anything resembling American Food.  Mexican (illegal) labor is OK and money is the only thing that counts.  Of course there is sex which the film shows is best outside of marriage because it doesn't exist within marriage or at least is perfunctory. Infidelity is rampant but no judgements are rendered other than it is typical.  My favorite was that for women life ends at 40 and you are then considered old and unattractive. This is true in Hollywood and this could have been an opportunity to actually make a point but instead the movie raises the issue -- like so many others -- and just moves on.  The only decent person in this film were the latent homosexuals who at least seemed like a decent set of guys and the one was at least trying to make his marriage work.So the film introduces these three couples but never explains anything about them or brings any of the marriages to any sort of a conclusion.  So the viewer is left with a ""who cares"" feeling about these self-absorbed idiots who don't seem to care about each other or even to be connected at any emotional level.  Anniston is not much of an actress to start with and brings nothing to this role other than a level of unbelievability. She takes on a leech and shows no feelings towards him or anyone she comes into contact with, including the guy at the end who is weird and enigmatic.  She doesn't have money so she is an outcast because the only value a person has is in their bank.  So she ends up with the unattractive guy because he is rich or at least maintains that he is, but like everything else in this movie -- there is no conclusion and it ends like it begins -- loose ends with no beginning and no ending.This is a movie that reflects the value system I found when I lived there.  It demonstrates how coarse that California society has become and it demonstrates an almost total lack of writing ability.  I did notice that the reviewers from California liked this movie, but I suspect that is because it reflects their value system and life as they know it.

645238,A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B00005JP28,"Rudy Palma ""The Writing Fiend""","[9, 11]","Once in a while a film with the power to keep viewers thinking long beyond the roll of the credits comes along. Writer/director Nicole Holofcener's ""Friends with Money"" is such a film. The characters are clearly and distinctly cut and their interactions so filled with interesting and psychologically-charged dialogue that it bares richness very rare in film.It's not surprising that it garnered little respect and came and went quickly in the spring of 2006. Mismarketed as a light, comedic chick-flick, it is a strong and grippingly honest look at human nature - not a chick-flick and certainly not a comedy, despite the toothy grins of its stars on the DVD cover.Jennifer Aniston portrays Olivia, leading the way as the token black sheep. Although her friends are affluent, accomplished and happily married (or so it would seem) she is living through a pathetic phase. A former teacher emotionally scarred by her students, she becomes a maid, scrubbing strangers' showers and rifling through their vanities for pricey face creams. So great is this obsession that she spends an afternoon acquiring free samples from department stores, as if to flip her finger at her unenviable economic status.Joan Cusack portrays Franny, the wealthiest of the foursome whose husband Todd, played by Greg Germann, runs through her money like water. Her guilt over her trust fund status seethes beneath the surface of all she does, most especially her heated interactions with Olivia. Franny tries to compensate for her guilt by setting her up with personal trainer Mike, played by Scott Caan, a superficial stack of testosterone who only further serves to deplete Olivia's self-respect.Christine and David, played respectively by Catherine Keener and Jason Isaacs, are constantly at odds with each other. A married couple rife with problems, they dodge their predicament in the form of an addition to their more than adequate home.Meanwhile, Jane, portrayed by the incomparable Frances McDormand, has had as much she can take. Between twentysomethings cutting in line at Old Navy, pushy people stealing parking spots, those who simply don't say ""thank you"" when appropriate, and feeling marginalized as she approaches her mid-40's, the chip on her shoulder has a mind of its own. It doesn't help that her husband Aaron, played by Simon McBurney, comes off as a homosexual simply for being unconventional, most notably his sensitivity and fashion sense.Christine mentions that he is gay at every possible opportunity, which Franny rails against. Eventually she tells Todd that Christine is merely projecting her dissatisfaction with her own marriage onto another to temper her own denial. Later on, Christine asks her son if her shoes are too ""clunky,"" to which he merely shrugs. ""Good boy,"" she says and smiles, as if his having no opinion on shoes means he is, indeed, a boy. Meanwhile, Jane matter-of-factly tells Aaron that the time she realized that all shampoos ""had the same shit in them"" was when she married him, with neither realizing her latent rage.It is these kind of little nuances that make this film so engaging and original - and a missed opportunity at the Oscars.Every nook and cranny of ""Friends With Money"" is downright beautiful in its honesty about human nature. It morals are not derived from its many storylines, which may or may not resolve themselves by the end. Instead, they come in the realization that, like it or not, this is how we all are. Imperfect. Talking behind each others' backs. Unable to cope. Keeping secrets from those we supposedly love and care about. Anyone who can accept this part of themselves will find in ""Friends With Money"" a basic thesis for life itself.Indeed, as Olivia puts it, ""I got problems.""",5,'I Got Problems.',1172707200,"03 1, 2007",2007,3738,"['Once', 'while', 'film', 'power', 'keep', 'viewers', 'thinking', 'long', 'roll', 'credits', 'along', 'Writer/director', 'Nicole', 'Holofcener', 'Friends', 'Money', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'clearly', 'distinctly', 'cut', 'interactions', 'so', 'filled', 'interesting', 'psychologically-charged', 'dialogue', 'richness', 'very', 'rare', 'film.It', 'not', 'surprising', 'garnered', 'little', 'respect', 'came', 'went', 'quickly', 'spring', '2006', 'Mismarketed', 'light', 'comedic', 'chick-flick', 'strong', 'grippingly', 'honest', 'look', 'human', 'nature', 'not', 'chick-flick', 'certainly', 'not', 'comedy', 'toothy', 'grins', 'stars', 'DVD', 'cover.Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'portrays', 'Olivia', 'leading', 'way', 'token', 'black', 'sheep', 'friends', 'are', 'affluent', 'accomplished', 'happily', 'married', 'would', 'seem', 'living', 'pathetic', 'phase', 'former', 'teacher', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'students', 'maid', 'scrubbing', 'strangers', 'showers', 'rifling', 'vanities', 'pricey', 'face', 'creams', 'So', 'great', 'obsession', 'afternoon', 'acquiring', 'free', 'samples', 'department', 'stores', 'flip', 'finger', 'unenviable', 'economic', 'status.Joan', 'Cusack', 'Franny', 'wealthiest', 'foursome', 'husband', 'Todd', 'played', 'Greg', 'Germann', 'money', 'water', 'guilt', 'trust', 'fund', 'status', 'seethes', 'surface', 'most', 'especially', 'heated', 'interactions', 'Olivia', 'Franny', 'compensate', 'guilt', 'setting', 'up', 'personal', 'trainer', 'Mike', 'played', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'superficial', 'stack', 'testosterone', 'who', 'only', 'further', 'serves', 'deplete', 'Olivia', 'self-respect.Christine', 'David', 'played', 'respectively', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'are', 'constantly', 'odds', 'other', 'married', 'couple', 'rife', 'problems', 'dodge', 'predicament', 'form', 'addition', 'more', 'adequate', 'home.Meanwhile', 'Jane', 'portrayed', 'incomparable', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'had', 'much', 'can', 'take', 'Between', 'twentysomethings', 'cutting', 'line', 'Old', 'Navy', 'pushy', 'people', 'stealing', 'parking', 'spots', 'who', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'thank', 'when', 'appropriate', 'feeling', 'marginalized', 'mid-40', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'mind', 'own', ""n't"", 'help', 'husband', 'Aaron', 'played', 'Simon', 'McBurney', 'off', 'homosexual', 'simply', 'being', 'unconventional', 'most', 'notably', 'sensitivity', 'fashion', 'sense.Christine', 'mentions', 'gay', 'possible', 'opportunity', 'Franny', 'Eventually', 'Todd', 'Christine', 'merely', 'projecting', 'dissatisfaction', 'own', 'marriage', 'temper', 'own', 'denial', 'Later', 'Christine', 'son', 'shoes', 'are', 'too', 'clunky', 'merely', 'shrugs', 'Good', 'boy', 'having', 'opinion', 'shoes', 'means', 'indeed', 'boy', 'Meanwhile', 'Jane', 'matter-of-factly', 'Aaron', 'time', 'realized', 'shampoos', 'had', 'same', 'shit', 'was', 'when', 'married', 'realizing', 'latent', 'rage.It', 'kind', 'little', 'nuances', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'engaging', 'original', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'Oscars.Every', 'nook', 'cranny', 'Friends', 'Money', 'downright', 'beautiful', 'honesty', 'human', 'nature', 'morals', 'are', 'not', 'derived', 'many', 'storylines', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'resolve', 'end', 'Instead', 'come', 'realization', 'not', 'how', 'are', 'Imperfect', 'Talking', 'others', 'backs', 'Unable', 'cope', 'Keeping', 'secrets', 'supposedly', 'love', 'care', 'Anyone', 'who', 'can', 'accept', 'part', 'will', 'find', 'Friends', 'Money', 'basic', 'thesis', 'life', 'itself.Indeed', 'Olivia', 'got', 'problems']",N/A

Franny stays at home with her two kids, while her husband (Greg Germann) works. Their relationship is good and their biggest decision is where they should make a large donation. Christine and her husband, David (Jason Isaacs) are screenwriters who work together, argue a lot and have decided to put a second floor extension on their house. Jane is a well-known fashion designer who loves her husband Aaron (Simon McBurney), who everyone thinks is gay. Olivia, on the other hand, cleans people's homes, having quit her job as a teacher at an exclusive school because the kids were making fun of her. She has trouble finding her place in life when all around her; everyone seems to be doing much better.Nicole Holofcener's (""Lovely and Amazing"") new film ""Friends with Money"" has some richly observed moments and some good laughs about adult friendship.Olivia is Jennifer Aniston's best character since ""The Good Girl"". Unmotivated, slightly depressed and confused, Olivia clearly doesn't want a lot of pressure or obligation in her life, working as a maid in various people's homes. After she spends her day cleaning for others, she goes home and pines for the man she once loved, a married man who had an affair with her. Franny fixes her up with Mike (Scott Caan), her trainer, and they begin a relationship which doesn't seem to give Olivia a lot of joy.As we watch Olivia wade through her pot-hazed life, Aniston portrays why this woman would feel this way, giving us a rich portrayal of a woman who doesn't do much. But we get why she would begin a relationship with Mike. We get why she calls her ex-boyfriend every night and hangs up. We understand her feelings of abandonment when she hangs around her once very close friends.Really, with a supporting cast including Catherine Keener, Frances McDormand and Joan Cusack how could the film go wrong? Each is great as a very different friend to Olivia. Frances McDormand is the standout as Jane, the fashion designer who just turned 43 and seems to be experiencing a mid-life crisis. But Keener and Cusack are both very good as well. Each has their personal problems and problems with their relationship, but they are unique enough to be different.There are some truly funny moments, the type of moments Woody Allen used to create for his very similar films. The dates between Olivia (Aniston) and Mike (Caan) are funny, unusual and painful to watch. Jane (McDormand) steals many of the scenes she is in, as she plays a fashion designer who is losing control. Unfortunately, I find myself getting annoyed at many of the same things her character does. I hope I can prevent going off the deep end. I'm getting close, but I hope I can watch stem the tide.""Friends with Money"" depicts a moment in these characters lives.

The issue is first and foremost the friends and not the money - which only heightens the situation and makes it easier to see the gaps that have developed between the friends over the years. I think that although money is always an issue these gaps are not always money-connected but can also be different ways of thinking about life and the ways it should be led.For me it was the everyday, typical situations that make this film so familiar and thus so enjoyable. The ""ungrateful"" parents of another child, who do not even recognize your face after their son has spent hours in your house.....dinners together... analyzing the other guests on the way home. Husband and wife relations, when each one wrapped in its own thoughts... the gossiping circles (what is wrong with other people's life... trying to justify my own)... and above all the very strong loyalty and love that bonds the friends together. Another feeling was that you never really know about someone else even if he is a really close friend.Christine (Catherine Keener) is the first one to mention that Aaron (Simon Mcburney) is gay. It seems that she is the one to realize his true nature when she is in a time of need and finds out that maybe he is more of a man then all of the other husbands. I liked this moment of small understanding or seeing things from a different perspective. I liked the gestures and nuances of behavior between the friends and the couples such as the ""you were the prettiest one there"" between husband and wife.Frances McDormand is always a reason to watch a movie (I think everything she does is Oscar material). The rest of the cast is also great, especially Joan Cusack that manages to deliver a very warm character. Jennifer Aniston is always nice to watch although not in the same caliber and Simon Mcburney stands out among the men characters.",4,You and your friends,1165104000,"12 3, 2006",2006,2107,"['spite', 'something', 'little', 'incoherent', 'not', 'tight', 'enough', 'film', 'messages', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'tremendously', 'can', 'only', 'explain', 'myself', 'main', 'aim', 'was', 'not', 'necessarily', 'deliver', 'complete', 'message', 'capture', 'very', 'familiar', 'situation', 'issue', 'first', 'foremost', 'friends', 'not', 'money', 'only', 'situation', 'easier', 'see', 'gaps', 'have', 'developed', 'friends', 'years', 'think', 'money', 'always', 'issue', 'gaps', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'money-connected', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'different', 'ways', 'thinking', 'life', 'ways', 'should', 'be', 'was', 'everyday', 'typical', 'situations', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'familiar', 'thus', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'ungrateful', 'parents', 'child', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'recognize', 'face', 'son', 'spent', 'hours', 'house', 'together', 'analyzing', 'other', 'guests', 'way', 'home', 'Husband', 'wife', 'relations', 'when', 'one', 'wrapped', 'own', 'thoughts', 'gossiping', 'circles', 'what', 'wrong', 'other', 'people', 'life', 'trying', 'justify', 'own', 'very', 'strong', 'loyalty', 'love', 'bonds', 'friends', 'together', 'feeling', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'someone', 'else', 'even', 'really', 'close', 'friend.Christine', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'first', 'one', 'mention', 'Aaron', 'Simon', 'Mcburney', 'gay', 'one', 'realize', 'true', 'nature', 'when', 'time', 'need', 'out', 'maybe', 'more', 'man', 'then', 'other', 'husbands', 'liked', 'moment', 'small', 'understanding', 'seeing', 'things', 'different', 'perspective', 'liked', 'gestures', 'nuances', 'behavior', 'friends', 'couples', 'such', 'were', 'prettiest', 'one', 'husband', 'wife.Frances', 'McDormand', 'always', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'think', 'everything', 'Oscar', 'material', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'great', 'especially', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'deliver', 'very', 'warm', 'character', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'always', 'nice', 'watch', 'not', 'same', 'caliber', 'Simon', 'Mcburney', 'out', 'men', 'characters']",N/A
