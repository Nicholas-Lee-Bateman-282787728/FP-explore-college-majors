One Piece comes uncut and unedited, redubbed, the way it was supposed to be seen from the good folks at Funimation.This 13 episode set covers the end of the Arlong Ark, plus Logue Town. Luffy battles Fishman Arlong, Nami formally joins the crew, and Buggy returns! There's plenty of action early on, then a lull of fluff episodes, before Luffy's second confrontation with Buggy the Clown. It has been said many times before, One Piece just keeps getting stronger and stronger. Catch this batch of episodes, because pretty soon, One Piece takes off the training wheels and will be blasting across the Grand Line.",5,"If you can only own one long runner, make it this one",1267056000,"02 25, 2010",2010,652,"['Kick', 'weak-ass', '4Kid', 'dub', 'curb', 'One', 'Piece', 'uncut', 'unedited', 'redubbed', 'way', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'seen', 'good', 'folks', 'Funimation.This', '13', 'episode', 'set', 'end', 'Arlong', 'Ark', 'Logue', 'Town', 'Luffy', 'Fishman', 'Arlong', 'Nami', 'formally', 'crew', 'Buggy', 'plenty', 'action', 'early', 'then', 'lull', 'fluff', 'episodes', 'Luffy', 'second', 'confrontation', 'Buggy', 'Clown', 'been', 'said', 'many', 'times', 'One', 'Piece', 'just', 'getting', 'stronger', 'stronger', 'Catch', 'batch', 'episodes', 'pretty', 'soon', 'One', 'Piece', 'training', 'wheels', 'will', 'be', 'blasting', 'Grand', 'Line']","One Piece: Season 1, Fourth Voyage"

1222982,ACTHUAU2A70DF,B001OPQIGK,"M. Sharpless ""NERV""","[5, 7]","After ""Arlong's reign of terror"" the crew of Monkey D. Luffy is at it again in this Fourth Voyage.  What can I say about this awesome show?  It just keeps getting better, and better.  This DVD box set is the same as the others.  14 Episodes of pure fun, and adventure.  Marathon mode and some extra's are included, but not much to talk about.  This box set has episodes 40-53 as described by Amazon, which leads to the only complaint anyone has about this show.  The show is still going strong in Japan, with over 400 episodes.  It's going to take a while for the US to catch up, so one would only hope that Funimation will start to release bigger box sets. The voice acting is superb.  At first Luffy's voice takes you by surprise, but you get use to it and it really does fit his creature.  If you a parent of a young child, than I would suggest that you stay clear of this release and buy the 4Kids version, the 4Kids version is heavily edited but is more suitable for younger children (for instance, Sanji cigarettes are turned into lollypops).  This version is uncut, and contains violence, and cursing.  Overall, this box set has nothing new, but episodes.  It's the same packaging as the others, and continues a great story.  It's worth the money.",5,Here we go again!!,1238457600,"03 31, 2009",2009,1254,"['Arlong', 'reign', 'terror', 'crew', 'Monkey', 'D.', 'Luffy', 'again', 'Fourth', 'Voyage', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'awesome', 'show', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'same', 'others', '14', 'Episodes', 'pure', 'fun', 'adventure', 'Marathon', 'mode', 'extra', 'are', 'included', 'not', 'much', 'talk', 'box', 'set', 'episodes', '40-53', 'described', 'Amazon', 'only', 'complaint', 'anyone', 'show', 'show', 'still', 'going', 'strong', 'Japan', '400', 'episodes', 'going', 'take', 'while', 'US', 'catch', 'up', 'one', 'would', 'only', 'hope', 'Funimation', 'will', 'start', 'release', 'bigger', 'box', 'sets', 'voice', 'acting', 'superb', 'first', 'Luffy', 'voice', 'surprise', 'get', 'use', 'really', 'fit', 'creature', 'parent', 'young', 'child', 'would', 'suggest', 'stay', 'clear', 'release', 'buy', '4Kids', 'version', '4Kids', 'version', 'heavily', 'edited', 'more', 'suitable', 'younger', 'children', 'instance', 'Sanji', 'cigarettes', 'are', 'turned', 'lollypops', 'version', 'uncut', 'violence', 'cursing', 'Overall', 'box', 'set', 'nothing', 'new', 'episodes', 'same', 'packaging', 'others', 'great', 'story', 'money']","One Piece: Season 1, Fourth Voyage"
