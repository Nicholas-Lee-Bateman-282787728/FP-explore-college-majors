First of all, I rather enjoy the ""found footage"" genre, but this one wasn't of said genre. The concept was good, but the script and acting were terrible. Nothing made any sense. SPOILER ALERT! For example, why did the doctor commit suicide? And who assassinated the ""expert""? I'm sorry... I tend to look for the good in any movie, no matter how amateurish, but I just couldn't find any in this atrocity.",1,"A MOVIE SO BAD, THAT I'M GOING TO PAY THE USED CD PLACE TO TAKE IT OFF MY HANDS...",1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,477,"['fellow', 'reviewers', 'were', 'spot-on', 'assessment', 'stinker', 'First', 'rather', 'enjoy', 'found', 'footage', 'genre', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'said', 'genre', 'concept', 'was', 'good', 'script', 'acting', 'were', 'terrible', 'Nothing', 'made', 'sense', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'example', 'why', 'did', 'doctor', 'commit', 'suicide', 'who', 'assassinated', 'expert', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'tend', 'look', 'good', 'movie', 'matter', 'how', 'amateurish', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'atrocity']",Paranormal Asylum

Berman ""Kitty Safe Network""","[2, 3]","First sign this movie is going to be terrible... two guys go out to an old ruined home in the woods, one guy sees an old lady, the first guy  says, why are you freaking out about old ladies?  Second guy doesn't point out the fact that she doesn't exist?  lol... The writing is just that bad... and that's the very first scene, so I have my trusty popcorn and my kitty cat, but it looks like this one is going to be really bad.I love horror films, paranormal films that take place in an asylum so I gave it a shot, I don't mind independent movies, amateur actors, if the story is really good.I was interested in the story being told here, but the problems are many.The script is not very well written, the scenes are poorly utilized, such as when a guy goes to see archives, he doesn't seem to find anything and the whole scene comes off as worthless, adding no depth or tension or reason to the film.Something begins to happen but then just cuts and it's over and no one's that impressed or surprised, which makes no sense.Poorly written characters throughout.No one has any chemistry, the friendship, the girlfriend?  No one has any believable connection or emotion to the relationships they're supposed to be portraying... Laura Gilreath and Aaron Mathias do an alright job with the maddeningly bad script and direction.I love when the half brother is giving Andy s*** about borrowing his boat, and then when we finally see the boat it's a pretty cheap boat with cheap plastic back yard chairs tied together.There's some decent story twists that I enjoyed, such as Mary finding him and getting taken back to the hospital and Aaron pursuing, showing you the movie really could have been better if they had just kept the story more human and not tried to be so ""smart"" with the dialog that really hurt the film.2/10",2,"Not so bad it's good, just bad",1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,1815,"['First', 'sign', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'terrible', 'two', 'guys', 'go', 'out', 'old', 'ruined', 'home', 'woods', 'one', 'guy', 'old', 'lady', 'first', 'guy', 'why', 'are', 'freaking', 'out', 'old', 'ladies', 'Second', 'guy', ""n't"", 'point', 'out', 'fact', ""n't"", 'exist', 'lol', 'writing', 'just', 'bad', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'have', 'trusty', 'popcorn', 'kitty', 'cat', 'one', 'going', 'be', 'really', 'bad.I', 'love', 'horror', 'films', 'paranormal', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'asylum', 'so', 'gave', 'shot', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'independent', 'movies', 'amateur', 'actors', 'story', 'really', 'good.I', 'was', 'interested', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'here', 'problems', 'are', 'many.The', 'script', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'scenes', 'are', 'poorly', 'utilized', 'such', 'when', 'guy', 'see', 'archives', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'anything', 'whole', 'scene', 'off', 'worthless', 'adding', 'depth', 'tension', 'reason', 'film.Something', 'happen', 'then', 'just', 'cuts', 'one', 'impressed', 'surprised', 'sense.Poorly', 'written', 'characters', 'throughout.No', 'one', 'chemistry', 'friendship', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'believable', 'connection', 'emotion', 'relationships', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'portraying', 'Laura', 'Gilreath', 'Aaron', 'Mathias', 'do', 'alright', 'job', 'maddeningly', 'bad', 'script', 'direction.I', 'love', 'when', 'half', 'brother', 'giving', 'Andy', 's***', 'borrowing', 'boat', 'then', 'when', 'finally', 'see', 'boat', 'pretty', 'cheap', 'boat', 'cheap', 'plastic', 'back', 'yard', 'chairs', 'tied', 'decent', 'story', 'twists', 'enjoyed', 'such', 'Mary', 'finding', 'getting', 'taken', 'back', 'hospital', 'Aaron', 'pursuing', 'showing', 'movie', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'just', 'kept', 'story', 'more', 'human', 'not', 'tried', 'be', 'so', 'smart', 'dialog', 'really', 'film.2/10']",Paranormal Asylum

They appear to be conducting paranormal investigation, but also a documentary. Andy's girlfriend Michelle (Laura Gilreath) invites herself into the investigation.The film is NOT a found footage film as most of the movie is professionally done. The first ghost appears 6 minutes into the film and there is no lack of apparitions. The acting of the three main characters was decent, but when you get past that it falls off a cliff with Grace Evans being a laugh.The plot develops complexity with an ending that could have used a little more developing.Worth a rental if you are at a lost for a horror film.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, near sex.
