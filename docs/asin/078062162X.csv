30433,AK2Q7ML2RANDN,078062162X,A. Eby,"[2, 4]","Atom Egoyan has the clearest eye of any director I have ever seen. Watching his masterpiece &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;, 1997's critical darling, is like eavesdropping on the tragic, but REAL, lives of real people. It takes the end credits to remind you you are watching a movie.Ian Holm plays Mitchell Stephens, a well-to-do lawyer drowning in despair as he witnesses his daughter succumb to drugs. When a bus accident occurs in a small Canadian town, killing several children, Stephens travels there, offering his help to the families in suing the bus manufacturer.Sarah Polley plays Nicole, a clear-voiced, sweet-natured girl who becomes paralyzed after surviving the accident.These two actors are breathtaking. Their performances are simple and graceful; you don't get a sense of acting at all. Polley contributed several songs to the soundtrack and her voice can be heard, hauntingly sweet, in the background in many scenes, a reminder of the innocence and loss playing out on screen.Enveloped in the spare Canadian winter landscape, each breath the actors take can be seen and heard. Emotions are not expressed in words so much as in expressions and eyes. The pacing is slow, yes, but it is almost as though time has stopped for these grieving people and they exist in a universe all its own, so the slowness feels appropriate. The isolation is palpable.Watch for an exquisite scene where Holm finds himself sitting next to his daughter's old best friend on an airplane. It is one of the best I have ever seen.&quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; is real.

30437,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,078062162X,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","It's hard to write a review for the film and the film alone, for if you've read the brilliant novel they really mold into one amazing experience.  Both the novel and the film add so many layers and compliment one another so well that I'm almost forced to advise everyone who has seen this film to read the novel and visa-versa.  It's only in that way that you'll get the whole experience.  That's not to say that either is incomplete but that each one is so well-rounded, so well fleshed out and so in tune that it's almost a continuation rather than an adaptation.  That said I'll try and focus mainly on Atom Egoyan's film here but don't get upset it I reference Russell Banks' film adaptation more than once.First I want to point out that Atom Egoyan is a masterful director.  This is the first film of his that I have seen and I'm so impressed that I'm moved to rush to the side of some of his other work.  His style is so calm and relaxed; it perfectly fit the atmosphere of the story.  Some have mentioned this being boring or slow paced.  It's far from boring in my humble opinion, but the slow pacing is essential to the feel of the film.  It helps you to get inside the aftermath of the tragedy by fully understanding the mindset of the town.  If you've read the novel you'll understand better, for Banks' also was able to brilliantly capture that pure unsettling serenity with every page.The story focuses around the small town of Sam Dent after a tragic bus accident leaves 14 children dead, the bus driver, Dolores Driscoll, and a 14 year old student Nichole being two of the only survivors.  The film shifts its focus between a few key characters, Nichole, Mitchell (a lawyer) and Billy Ansel, a widower who lost his two children in the wreck.  The story follows Mitchell as he tries to persuade the town's people to file a negligence suit against the town of Sam Dent.  There are conflicting opinions in regard to the suit, to the money and to the accident as a whole and those opinions are fleshed out so well before us.  Each of these human beings has so much history, so much baggage, yet Egoyan's superb film never gets bogged down.  That is due in large part to his calm and tranquil pace.The acting here is nothing short of spectacular.  The entire cast is so evenly immersed in the very atmosphere Atom expertly crafted that it's hard to really single anyone out but I will make mention of the three main characters and the three brilliant actors who portrayed them.  We'll start with Ian Holm since his character has the most screen time here.  As Mitchell he perfectly captures the essence of this character, his deep-rooted heartache and emotional depravity.  He's closed off to himself due to the immense pain that builds around his heart because of his wayward daughter.  Bruce Greenwood does a superb job as well.  His portrayal of Billy Ansel is so captivating, perfectly grasping every emotion this man possesses.  Surpassing them all though is the performance given by Sarah Polley, who plays the most pivotal character of Nichole.  Her performance is so tender, so tranquil, so effortless that I'm appalled she was denied the Oscar nomination when she deserved to take home the top prize.  Tom McCamus, Alberta Watson, Gabrielle Rose and Caerthan Banks also put in brilliant supporting performances, so I want to make mention of them briefly as well.For some novel and film comparisons...To me the novel excels in really exposing Mitchell Stephens, for the man he really is.  He's troubled by the wayward course his only daughter Zoe has taken and this affects his almost every move.  It's almost as if he's fighting for her with every breath, every case, as if she was his only motive.  I feel that film adaptation excels in really exposing Nichole's character.  That's not to say that Banks doesn't breathe life into the soul he created, but Egoyan's film effortlessly makes her the star, giving her so much substance and character and really fleshing her out in all due subtlety to make her relatable and heartbreaking, the moral center of a tragic accident.  The book brilliantly relates Dolores Driscoll's account of the accident as well as the post-accident life in the small town, her treatment by the town's people before and after.Somewhere where the novel and the film seem to tie or at least both deliver valiantly is in the case of Billy Ansel, the Vietnam-War Vet widower who loved his kids more than anything, the man who was trailing behind the bus waving to his children when he lost his whole world with the sight of a crash.  His story is heartbreaking.  The book though really delivers with its final chapter, something that is not delved into with the film, and it adds a few more layers to both Ansel and Driscoll.  But, speaking of finales, the film takes a different approach, centering more on Nichole's character, with the inclusion of the children's story `The Pied Piper of Hamelin'.  This poem when analyzed really helps flesh out Nichole's character and delivers such a powerful finale I was literally in tears.  So, this is why I can't help but recommend both in the same breath.  They both add so much and deliver so well that you truly must read and then watch or watch and then read to grasp the magic in its entirety.",5,"Utter perfection; calm, subtle and heartbreaking

And so in the limited capacity one has as a dispassionate critic and a student of behavioural finance and economic agency theory, the motivations of each character ring more true than reality (the reality of the Alton, Texas tragedy) and therefore touch upon a new foundational mythos.

30440,A3NO9TSFVL1ZJD,078062162X,Bosco Hoggins,"[1, 10]","As you probably know, this movie explores the loss of children and of childhood.  This theme is manifested in different ways throughout the film, none more clearly than the central plot surrounding the loss of a whole generation of a mountain town's children through a tragic bus accident; beyond that, there are other less obvious explorations as well (both literal and figurative).  The theme has great merit and is absolutely worth contemplating on screen.  As the father of a young child, I could painfully and heartbreakingly relate to some of the characters' grief.  Given that, I have to admit the film was pretty ham-handed and not entirely convincing.  Here are a couple observations that I hope are helpful:(i) ActingActing was fair with some pretty notable exceptions downward.  I realize that his character was a man experiencing unexpressible despair, but the unfortunate truth of the matter is that Ian Holm overacted the central role.  I will grant that he did what he could with a pretty melodramatic script, but I just didn't buy that someone would emote like he does to practical strangers.  I felt kind of hit over the head by his whole ""sleazy lawyer"" routine which was over-the-top and pretty silly for a movie with as serious a theme as this one.Sarah Polley continues to prove to me that she is the most overrated talent in Hollywood, both in front of as well as behind the camera.  I hate to dump on the performance of a 16 year old, but she just monotones her entire role.  I imagine this was probably more a factor of inartful directing than anything else (""OK... The only way we can communicate how traumatized you really are is for you to stare straight-forward and mumble out your lines without any intonation whatsoever.  Otherwise the audiences just aren't going to 'get it'."")Other acting was ok.  I wish the script had given some of the more talented cast members something more to work with.  (""Each child is like a precious berry that I collect in my basket.""  Really?)(ii) Story and Script ****Mild Spoiler Alert****This movie had a great central theme and could have been really powerful and moving.  Instead, the script made it just kind of melodramatic and silly.  The central story about a town recovering from the loss of its children was interesting, but it gets loaded down with really obvious, ham-handed symbols (what was the Pied Piper supposed to represent again?) and a bunch of strangely grafted-on plot strings - one involving adultery, another involving incest, yet another involving an AIDS infected drug addict.  The result was that the movie as a whole seemed unfocused and like the filmmakers were trying to throw a kitchen sink-full of despair at the audience to see if anything would trigger their emotional hot buttons.  In the end, it just felt more manipulative than anything.  This was a real shame because the core of the film really was something (if adequately executed) pretty touching and which could have honestly earned what the filmmakers tried to manipulate their audiences into.(iii) Direction & CinematographyI know that this movie has gotten a lot of pretty substantial accolades for its direction and cinematography.  While there were some interesting things to look at in the film, along with it, there were just so many obvious pan shots and film school tricks that took the focus off the story and tone.  The suspension of disbelief would evaporate every ten minutes or so each time Atom Egoyan cut to a ten second shot of rustic buildings covered by snow or carnival rides silhouetted by twilight.  It is kind of like the strain of modern novel (ahem, Brett Easton Ellis) where you really can't engage in the story because the author keeps injecting his voice into the story to prove how cool he is (or in the case of Mr. Egoyan, how unfathomably artistic he believes himself to be).  In any case, to me (and reasonable people can differ) it seemed like the director kept trying to wave his arms at the audience and shout ""Hey, look at me!""  As a side note, the Coen Brothers do the same thing to much greater effect by introducing a hint of subtly into the convention.ConclusionSo, is The Sweet Hereafter worth purchasing?  While it is certainly not the worst movie I've seen this year (Clash of the Titans, anyone?), it really is not as interesting or moving as its reputation may lead you to believe.

It is a movie in which the plot, a lawyer attempts to make a big civil case out of a tragic school bus accident, is almost incidental.  What matters are the performances, the mood and the spellbinding out of sequence storytelling.  Ian Holm and Sara Polley lead a uniformly excellent cast.  Both are haunted by secret tragedies in their lives that show on their faces more than in their words.  Polley survived the crash, but is paralized and doted upon by the guilt ridden father who had committed incest with her before the accident.  Holm is a man tortured by a manipulative and drug addled daughter who knows how to exploit his emotions to her own ends.  In between, is the sad small Canadian town that lost most of its children to the accident.  All of this sounds bleakly depressing, and yet curiously it is not because of the way the beautiful way the movie is filmed and sequenced.  The use of the &quot;Pied Piper&quot; story as a literary subtext is the kind of unique touch that gives the film its power.Had Hollywood any imagination, &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; would have swept the Oscars the year it was released.

It really does delve down into the dark night of the soul, like the cinematic equivalent of a Sylvia Plath poem. It's a film about loss. Innocence lost, the questionability of ideals and motives. The end of childhood. Yet Egoyan doesn't deliver a totally bleak jeremiad here, either. Human beings are flawed, but they also are capable of growth and wisdom, though both are hard earned.As usual with Egoyan films, nature is at a distance and a remove from human beings and the turmoil brimming over inside them. The beautiful BC vistas are in contrast to the tragic event that occurs. It's a bit like the end of Moby Dick, when the Pequod is smashed and sinks, while the sun smiles down serenely on the calm sea. I think Egoyan's getting at the same thing Melville is, as well. It's an existentialist's way of looking at the universe. If we're looking for a higher power to bail us out, we're out of luck. Our other moral constructs are pretty shaky, as well. We tend to think a little better of ourselves than is often the case.As is also usual, Egoyan assembles an excellent cast, that feed off of each other's honest performances. No wrong notes here. Cinematography also up to the usual high standard. My appreciation for Egoyan's work increases with each new film I see.

Since we know what happens early in the film (save for a few minor details), because of Stevens' reactions and body language, there is little drama in the girl's testimonial lie. Even worse, because we know of the crash, the scene of the actual bus crash has little impact- there is nothing that allows us to feel the terror of the moment because we know it's coming. And the whole focus on guilt and loss turns precious in a monologue Stevens tells his daughter's best friend, about how he nearly had to save his daughter's life by cutting her throat when she was bitten by spiders as a baby. The whole flashback within the flashforward does not work for the lighting and dreaminess is so gauzey, saccharine, and so, `This is the big moment of the film,' that the viewer almost feels embarrassed at Egoyan's cluelessness at the inappropriateness of it all. What Egoyan does is fetishize guilt and loss, not examine it, as he claims in one of the DVD's bonus features. Whether this is because Egoyan is simply too immature to approach the subject, or thought he did and simply failed does not matter. The Sweet Hereafter simply is not that deep of a film, and had it gone a more standard route, it actually would have worked better. Overall, it is that rare film that `gilds the lily' to the point of taking an interesting premise and killing it. Simply put, a tragic subject matter does not automatically make for a deep film. Yes, The Sweet Hereafter does not sink to the depths of Brokeback Mountain nor Crash, but it does not rise to the heights of a film by a master like Ingmar Bergman, Michelangelo Antonioni, nor Yasujiro Ozu.The DVD, put out by New Line Films shows the hour and fifty-six minute long film in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, and has a pretty good commentary track by Egoyan and Banks, although Banks provides little insight, outside of cheering Egoyan on. Egoyan's comments are very hit and miss- praising the aforementioned car wash sequence, and actually telling the viewer that this represents a passage to light. Well, duh! Banks does, however, shine a bit more in a featurette where he and Egoyan discuss the book and film at a university. Then there is a strange feature where each cast member answers two questions, although the videos are part of the actors' filmography feature. There is a Charlie Rose interview segment with Egoyan, which is always well wrought, the poem The Pied Piper Of Hamelin in illustrated mode, Canadian and American film trailers, and an isolated musical score.The Sweet Hereafter is not a bad film- on a scale of 0-100 I'd rank it a passable 70, but that's still light years from being great cinema. Failure or not, there is enough skill in many aspects of this film, especially technically, to make me want to explore other works by Egoyan, however, if this film is any indication, Egoyan may be one of those filmmakers who'd do best to rely on the screenwriting skills of others, for this film's greatest flaws lie in its screenplay (not just in ill wrought scenes but in well written scenes that are placed poorly in the linear structure of the film, and having read the fiction of Russell Banks, I doubt the screenplay's flaws originated with the novel.

30446,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,078062162X,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[4, 4]","`The Sweet Hereafter' may not appear to be sweet, but then again that's all in the eye of the beholder.  It's a very soft-spoken look at the aftereffects of loss and the striving spirit for closure.  The story focuses on a small town after a tragic accident involving a school bus takes the lives of twenty children.  The town has no one to blame, no one to accuse and so they seclude themselves in their own lives and homes in order to deal with the tragedy.  That is until Mitchell (Holm) comes along.  Mitchell is a lawyer battling his own form of loss and is determined to help the people of this town find peace.Mitchell has lost his own daughter Zoe (Banks) to drugs and, as he so heartbreaking puts it, she's dead to him.  With this raw conviction he fights for the children lost in this bus accident, and in a way this is as much his battle as it is for the parents involved.  As he describes his feelings for his daughter, the ones he once had and the ones that now fester (that whole `steaming piss' speech) it is completely and utterly heart wrenching.  It becomes apparent as the film begins to wrap up that Mitchell is doing this for himself, as his own form of closure, as he explains to one father that he has lost his daughter as well, and even after that man has left Mitchell alone in the cold air Mitchell is still talking, still thinking, still dying little by little inside.Mitchell is not the only person effected of explored though...there are at least two others who are touched by the tragedy and the impending lawsuit of which Mitchell promises (or threatens depending on your viewpoint) to bring.One of these is Billy (Greenwood), a young widower of twins who were killed in the accident.  Unlike the rest of the town seeking answers, Billy just wants it to all go away.  He is agitated with not only Mitchell's arrival but even more so with the involvement of his friends.  One of those friends is Sam (McCamus) whose daughter Nicole (Polley) babysat for Billy and was one of the sole survivors of the crash.  Nicole and her father are suffering in other areas as well.  It becomes apparent about halfway through the film the Sam is somewhat of a sexual predator, at least in regards to his daughter, and this has caused a strain on their relationship (of course) but also on the case.It's a bit difficult to decide whether Nicole is distressed over the abuse her father used to inflict on her or if she's distressed for the fact that now that she's in a wheelchair he doesn't pay her that special kind of attention.  Regardless there is a mystery in her eyes that envelopes the entire film and creates a mood that serves the picture well.  The acting in this film is phenomenal and it's a shame that it was ignored completely come Oscar.  Holm, Greenwood and Polley all deserved Oscar recognition for they all enveloped their characters and delivered knockout performances.A common thread throughout the film is Nicole's reciting of `The Pied Piper of Hamelin' which serves as narrative throughout the later half of the film, and when studied it really serves as the moral behind her character.  Maybe it's just my perception but in a way I feel that Nicole wished she herself had died in that crash, for as she recites the later part of the poem when she references the young lame boy who could not follow the piper she reads with this sense of pain, as if she can relate for she was unable to escape the prison of her life.Brilliant film that reaches the heart and exposes the human need for closure and the constant desire to heal from the past.",5,A perfectly woven melodrama of human spirit...,1159833600,"10 3, 2006",2006,3577,"['Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'may', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'sweet', 'then', 'again', 'eye', 'beholder', 'very', 'soft-spoken', 'look', 'aftereffects', 'loss', 'striving', 'spirit', 'closure', 'story', 'small', 'town', 'tragic', 'accident', 'involving', 'school', 'bus', 'lives', 'twenty', 'children', 'town', 'one', 'blame', 'one', 'accuse', 'so', 'seclude', 'own', 'lives', 'homes', 'order', 'deal', 'tragedy', 'Mitchell', 'Holm', 'along', 'Mitchell', 'lawyer', 'battling', 'own', 'form', 'loss', 'determined', 'help', 'people', 'town', 'find', 'peace.Mitchell', 'lost', 'own', 'daughter', 'Zoe', 'Banks', 'drugs', 'so', 'heartbreaking', 'puts', 'dead', 'raw', 'conviction', 'children', 'lost', 'bus', 'accident', 'way', 'as', 'much', 'battle', 'parents', 'involved', 'feelings', 'daughter', 'ones', 'once', 'had', 'ones', 'now', 'fester', 'whole', 'steaming', 'piss', 'speech', 'completely', 'utterly', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'apparent', 'film', 'wrap', 'up', 'Mitchell', 'doing', 'own', 'form', 'closure', 'one', 'father', 'lost', 'daughter', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'man', 'left', 'Mitchell', 'alone', 'cold', 'air', 'Mitchell', 'still', 'talking', 'still', 'thinking', 'still', 'dying', 'little', 'little', 'inside.Mitchell', 'not', 'only', 'person', 'effected', 'explored', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'touched', 'tragedy', 'impending', 'lawsuit', 'Mitchell', 'depending', 'viewpoint', 'bring.One', 'Billy', 'Greenwood', 'young', 'widower', 'twins', 'who', 'were', 'killed', 'accident', 'rest', 'town', 'seeking', 'answers', 'Billy', 'just', 'go', 'away', 'agitated', 'not', 'only', 'Mitchell', 'arrival', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'involvement', 'friends', 'One', 'friends', 'Sam', 'McCamus', 'daughter', 'Nicole', 'Polley', 'babysat', 'Billy', 'was', 'one', 'sole', 'survivors', 'crash', 'Nicole', 'father', 'are', 'suffering', 'other', 'areas', 'well', 'apparent', 'halfway', 'film', 'Sam', 'somewhat', 'sexual', 'predator', 'least', 'regards', 'daughter', 'caused', 'strain', 'relationship', 'course', 'also', 'case.It', 'bit', 'difficult', 'decide', 'Nicole', 'distressed', 'abuse', 'father', 'used', 'inflict', 'distressed', 'fact', 'now', 'wheelchair', ""n't"", 'pay', 'special', 'kind', 'attention', 'Regardless', 'mystery', 'eyes', 'entire', 'film', 'mood', 'picture', 'well', 'acting', 'film', 'phenomenal', 'shame', 'was', 'ignored', 'completely', 'come', 'Oscar', 'Holm', 'Greenwood', 'Polley', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'recognition', 'enveloped', 'characters', 'delivered', 'knockout', 'performances.A', 'common', 'thread', 'film', 'Nicole', 'reciting', 'Pied', 'Piper', 'Hamelin', 'narrative', 'later', 'half', 'film', 'when', 'studied', 'really', 'moral', 'character', 'just', 'perception', 'way', 'feel', 'Nicole', 'wished', 'had', 'died', 'crash', 'later', 'part', 'poem', 'when', 'young', 'lame', 'boy', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'follow', 'piper', 'sense', 'pain', 'can', 'relate', 'was', 'unable', 'escape', 'prison', 'life.Brilliant', 'film', 'heart', 'human', 'need', 'closure', 'constant', 'desire', 'heal', 'past']",N/A

Nicole (Sarah Polley) dreams of being a rock star, and her father lovingly fosters the dream.  He  does everything for her including being her first lover.  And then there is  a bus accident and she ends up in a wheel chair and is told she is lucky,  since many of the other children died.  But she doesn't feel lucky.  She  turns her bitterness toward her father.  She has read Robert Browning's  ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin"" to two of the children who died, and now sees  her father as a piper who has failed her.  The love they had, now in the  light of the loss of her innocence, is seen as a fraud.  And she hates  him.Meanwhile, big city lawyer Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holms) comes to  town with the promise of getting a big settlement for the parents of the  dead and injured children.  He has an axe to grind and that axe is all that  is left of his life.  His sadness is a daughter who is a drug addict who  calls him only for money.  He can never say no, and she can never stop  using him.Billy Ansell lost his wife to cancer and is left with two  young children.  He finds sexual gratification from another man's wife.  When his children are killed he loses his love for her.  The lie that  Nicole finally tells to hurt her father is for him, and symbolizes her  turning from her father outward to another man.Director Atom Egoyan  seems to be saying that people stop loving one another sometimes with  reason, and sometimes without; and that the sadness of life is a failure of  love, that the brutality of life can kill our love.  This is the tragedy of  innocence lost, of our expulsion from the Garden of Eden, forcing us to see  ourselves as naked and morally corrupt.  The cold white mountain slopes  that surround the little northern town remind us of how cold it is in the  world away from childhood.I have always objected to ""the loss of  innocence"" as a falsification of who we are.  We were never innocent: it  only seems so in retrospect.  It is not the fathers who corrupt their  daughters nor the daughters who betray their fathers: it is rather the  species mechanism that drives them apart, sometimes with such brutal force  that all are hurt.  Our expulsion from the Garden of Eden symbolizes our  loss of ignorance, the growth of our neocortex, and our assumption of  consciousness.  Again we were never innocent: we just didn't know what the  hell we were doing or why.  Now we know, except we kid ourselves a  lot.Sarah Polley's performance is so natural, vivid and balanced that I  felt that I knew her as someone in my own life.  The entire cast does a  good job, especially Ian Holm.  Atom Egoyan has a deft touch that is  focused and realistic, never extreme.  He doesn't preach to us and he works  hard to be fair to his characters.  Ultimately, he's a cinematic artist,  and a good one.",5,"Poetic, beautiful and bittersweet",964051200,"07 20, 2000",2000,2943,"['innocence', 'lost', ""n't"", 'just', 'children', 'who', 'lose', 'innocence', 'whole', 'town', 'adults', 'Nicole', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'dreams', 'being', 'rock', 'star', 'father', 'lovingly', 'dream', 'everything', 'including', 'being', 'first', 'lover', 'then', 'bus', 'accident', 'up', 'wheel', 'chair', 'told', 'lucky', 'many', 'other', 'children', 'died', ""n't"", 'feel', 'lucky', 'bitterness', 'father', 'read', 'Robert', 'Browning', 'Pied', 'Piper', 'Hamelin', 'two', 'children', 'who', 'died', 'now', 'father', 'piper', 'who', 'failed', 'love', 'had', 'now', 'light', 'loss', 'innocence', 'seen', 'fraud', 'him.Meanwhile', 'big', 'city', 'lawyer', 'Mitchell', 'Stephens', 'Ian', 'Holms', 'town', 'promise', 'getting', 'big', 'settlement', 'parents', 'dead', 'injured', 'children', 'axe', 'grind', 'axe', 'left', 'life', 'sadness', 'daughter', 'who', 'drug', 'addict', 'who', 'only', 'money', 'can', 'never', 'say', 'no', 'can', 'never', 'stop', 'using', 'him.Billy', 'Ansell', 'lost', 'wife', 'cancer', 'left', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'sexual', 'gratification', 'man', 'wife', 'When', 'children', 'are', 'killed', 'love', 'lie', 'Nicole', 'finally', 'hurt', 'father', 'turning', 'father', 'outward', 'man.Director', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'be', 'saying', 'people', 'stop', 'loving', 'one', 'sometimes', 'reason', 'sometimes', 'sadness', 'life', 'failure', 'love', 'brutality', 'life', 'can', 'kill', 'love', 'tragedy', 'innocence', 'lost', 'expulsion', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'forcing', 'see', 'naked', 'morally', 'corrupt', 'cold', 'white', 'mountain', 'slopes', 'surround', 'little', 'northern', 'town', 'remind', 'how', 'cold', 'world', 'away', 'childhood.I', 'have', 'always', 'objected', 'loss', 'innocence', 'falsification', 'who', 'are', 'were', 'never', 'innocent', 'only', 'so', 'retrospect', 'not', 'fathers', 'who', 'corrupt', 'daughters', 'daughters', 'who', 'betray', 'fathers', 'rather', 'species', 'mechanism', 'apart', 'sometimes', 'such', 'brutal', 'force', 'are', 'hurt', 'expulsion', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'loss', 'ignorance', 'growth', 'neocortex', 'assumption', 'consciousness', 'were', 'never', 'innocent', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'hell', 'were', 'doing', 'why', 'Now', 'know', 'kid', 'lot.Sarah', 'Polley', 'performance', 'so', 'natural', 'vivid', 'balanced', 'felt', 'knew', 'someone', 'own', 'life', 'entire', 'cast', 'good', 'job', 'especially', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'deft', 'touch', 'focused', 'realistic', 'never', 'extreme', ""n't"", 'preach', 'hard', 'be', 'fair', 'characters', 'Ultimately', 'cinematic', 'artist', 'good', 'one']",N/A
30449,A2ZJ2H6DRSPVZ8,078062162X,Diane Stranz,"[0, 0]","I am a non-practising lawyer who studied this haunting film in 1998 at a Continuing Legal Education course.  The Sweet Hereafter was used as an educational film for lawyers precisely because it realistically portrays the harm caused grieving families and communities when unethical members of our profession prey upon grief for the purpose of making money.  The legal profession is the source of much woe in American society; this movie is a must-see for citizens who are concerned about legal tactics which degrade us as a nation, and desire to participate meaningfully in the type of public debates necessary to curb them.I read online yesterday that less than two weeks after the massacre of 20 children and 6 adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, a lawyer named Irv Pinsky has filed a $100 million lawsuit against the school district on behalf of . . .(wait for it!) . . . anonymous Jill Doe, one of the children who SURVIVED (claiming damages for the emotional distress she suffered by hearing cursing, screaming and gunfire over the school intercom).  I was not only shocked and saddened, but also immediately thought of this movie, The Sweet Hereafter.The Sweet Hereafter is an uncannily relevant cautionary tale not only for lawyer Pinsky but to every parent who had a child inside Sandy Hook on December 14, 2012.  I would like to include a reprint of a Comment I left to the news story about Pinsky's suit:This lawyer Irv Pinsky is as shameful as the scammer who created a website in Noah Pozner's name and fraudulently enticed money contributions by claiming the money was going to the Pozner family.  ""Jill Doe""'s parents should be court-ordered to watch Atom Egoyan's haunting 1997 movie The Sweet Hereafter to get a reality-check about the irreparable and fragmenting damage Irv Pinsky has induced them to cause the Newtown community via this lawsuit.In The Sweet Hereafter, a bunch of really decent people lose their children in a freak school bus accident, and the small, close-knit community is thrust into traumatized grief (sound familiar?)  The accident was caused by a combination of icy roads and human error, though no one blames the driver (who is a really sweet woman who loved these kids dearly and herself was severely injured in the crash).  Within a week, though, a lawyer arrives in town who knows how to manipulate grief into greed, and his machinations destroy both community solidarity and the nascent healing process.  First he convinces one family to file suit against the manufacturer of the school bus (i.e., a 'deep pocket') even though the company bears no liability for the crash.  Then he churns emotions, turning 'brother against brother,' by lobbying grief-stricken families to join the suit so it can be upgraded to a class action (since that is how he personally will make a killing).Watching the destructive effects of a fictional lawsuit on a fictional American small town is almost literally painful; yet you do not have to be a rocket scientist to foresee that what was once 'merely' fiction is about to become ACTUAL HISTORICAL REALITY in Newtown, Connecticut, since it is only a matter of time before Irv Pinsky will induce other families to join this suit in a quest to win his own litigation jackpot.Predatory Lawyering needs to recognized as the capital criminal offense it most certainly is (and has always been), amen.  Why do We The People tolerate these types of predators?End of comment.  This movie is a must see for every American citizen.  Yesterday after I wrote that comment I read online that a charter bus in Oregon slid off the road in icy conditions and 9 people were killed.  This second tragedy is even MORE factually relevant to the plot of The Sweet Hereafter:  I hope Oregon citizens will similiarly heed the lessons embedded within this film.

30450,A2SVRQ64PMD8ZD,078062162X,"""elchanco""","[5, 7]","The Sweet Hereafter is a film that is truly original and rightfully won the Grand Prix and International Film Critics Prize at Cannes, which is probably more important than the Director Oscar nomination, because of Cannes' non political approach to selecting it's winners .  It's ideas of tragedy and loss are familiar, but the way in which Egoyan deals with the story is unlike any other.The film is about a tragedy (a school bus accident) that falls upon a small Canadian town in B.C.  First of all, Egoyan manages to capture small town life perfectly.  He shows the various community members as being individual people, rather than just painting a broad stroke of locals from the boonies.The story is taken from Russel Banks' novel, who also wrote Affliction.  There are some significant changes to the book.  Ian Holm, a lawyer, has been made into the center point of the story.  Egoyan has integrated the story of the Pied Piper into the story as well.  Sarah Polley, a survivor of the accident, whose character in the book is full of anger directed towards her sexually abusive father, has a different perspective in the film.  Also, there is a very quick scene of incest between the two that seems to be consensual on both parties, an image that caused some controversy when the film was first released.  The ending of the book also featured a sort of cathartic crash derby that has been compltely removed - a welcome change seeing as how it would be difficult to keep it in the film without altering the overall feel.Ian Holm is a lawyer who isn't even an ambulance chaser because he doesnt have the energy.  He comes to the town to try and represent families who have lost their children and try to bring any sort of suit that would award them damages.  He, like the families also lost one of his children - his daughter.  Except she isn't physically dead.  Her brain may be because she's a drug addict, and Holm's relationship with her provides an interesting subplot that shows the anguish he must feel (although he keeps his emotions hidden from his face) dealing with a case so close to him.Holm's investigation focuses on Sarah Polley, a girl who was crippled by the crash, but not killed.  He needs her to testify to bring more leverage to his case.  Her father Tom McCamus seems to be a good man from the images we see of he and his daughter at a fair and helping her with her music, although the scene in the hayloft(?) suggests otherwise.Bruce Greenwood plays a man who has lost his two children.  He allowed Polley to babysit them prior to their death.  He is the man who is opposed to Holm' efforts and demonstrates this perfectly when he visits Polley's parents  one evening, and when he confronts Holm at the site where the destroyed bus has been taken.Gabrielle Rose plays the bus driver and is very effective.  We can see how much the kids meant to her, how she thought of them as her own, this also makes the concluding testimony particularly relevant to her.  The entire film is summed up at the end when she and Holm meet eyes.Egoyan has kept the interwoven timelines of the book, that may be confusing for viewers who don't pay attention, and made them so that the story never loses its atmosphere.  He also demonstrates his already obvious maturity, by not exploting the crash itself.  He doesn't have sounds of scraping metal or images of bloody children or close ups to shock the viewer.  He placidly shows the bus disappear into the icy waters from a fair distance back, also from the point of view of the sole witness of the actual crash.The film is shot beautifully.  It captures the wintry climate to a spectacular degree.  There are aerial shots that show the openness of the white landscape.  The music is sort of tribal with The Tragically Hip's song Courage the main theme.The film has a measured pace which allows us to fully feel a scene before it jumps to the next.  The acting is superb and understated.",5,sweet hereafter,1010793600,"01 12, 2002",2002,3946,"['Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'film', 'truly', 'original', 'rightfully', 'won', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'International', 'Film', 'Critics', 'Prize', 'Cannes', 'probably', 'more', 'important', 'Director', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Cannes', 'non', 'political', 'approach', 'selecting', 'winners', 'ideas', 'tragedy', 'loss', 'are', 'familiar', 'way', 'Egoyan', 'deals', 'story', 'other.The', 'film', 'tragedy', 'school', 'bus', 'accident', 'small', 'Canadian', 'town', 'B.C', 'First', 'Egoyan', 'capture', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'perfectly', 'various', 'community', 'members', 'being', 'individual', 'people', 'rather', 'just', 'painting', 'broad', 'stroke', 'locals', 'boonies.The', 'story', 'taken', 'Russel', 'Banks', 'novel', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'Affliction', 'are', 'significant', 'changes', 'book', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'lawyer', 'been', 'made', 'center', 'point', 'story', 'Egoyan', 'integrated', 'story', 'Pied', 'Piper', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'survivor', 'accident', 'character', 'book', 'full', 'anger', 'directed', 'sexually', 'abusive', 'father', 'different', 'perspective', 'film', 'Also', 'very', 'quick', 'scene', 'incest', 'two', 'be', 'consensual', 'parties', 'image', 'caused', 'controversy', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'ending', 'book', 'also', 'featured', 'sort', 'cathartic', 'crash', 'derby', 'been', 'compltely', 'removed', 'welcome', 'change', 'seeing', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'keep', 'film', 'altering', 'overall', 'feel.Ian', 'Holm', 'lawyer', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'ambulance', 'chaser', 'have', 'energy', 'town', 'try', 'represent', 'families', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'children', 'try', 'bring', 'sort', 'suit', 'would', 'award', 'damages', 'families', 'also', 'lost', 'one', 'children', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'physically', 'dead', 'brain', 'may', 'be', 'drug', 'addict', 'Holm', 'relationship', 'interesting', 'subplot', 'anguish', 'must', 'feel', 'emotions', 'hidden', 'face', 'dealing', 'case', 'so', 'close', 'him.Holm', 'investigation', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'crippled', 'crash', 'not', 'killed', 'testify', 'bring', 'more', 'leverage', 'case', 'father', 'Tom', 'McCamus', 'be', 'good', 'man', 'images', 'see', 'daughter', 'fair', 'helping', 'music', 'scene', 'hayloft', 'otherwise.Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'two', 'children', 'allowed', 'Polley', 'babysit', 'prior', 'death', 'man', 'who', 'opposed', 'Holm', 'efforts', 'perfectly', 'when', 'Polley', 'parents', 'one', 'evening', 'when', 'Holm', 'site', 'where', 'destroyed', 'bus', 'been', 'taken.Gabrielle', 'Rose', 'bus', 'driver', 'very', 'effective', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'kids', 'meant', 'how', 'thought', 'own', 'also', 'concluding', 'testimony', 'particularly', 'relevant', 'entire', 'film', 'summed', 'up', 'end', 'when', 'Holm', 'meet', 'eyes.Egoyan', 'kept', 'interwoven', 'timelines', 'book', 'may', 'be', 'confusing', 'viewers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'made', 'so', 'story', 'never', 'atmosphere', 'also', 'already', 'obvious', 'maturity', 'not', 'exploting', 'crash', ""n't"", 'have', 'sounds', 'scraping', 'metal', 'images', 'bloody', 'children', 'close', 'ups', 'shock', 'viewer', 'placidly', 'bus', 'disappear', 'icy', 'waters', 'fair', 'distance', 'back', 'also', 'point', 'view', 'sole', 'witness', 'actual', 'crash.The', 'film', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'wintry', 'climate', 'spectacular', 'degree', 'are', 'aerial', 'shots', 'show', 'openness', 'white', 'landscape', 'music', 'sort', 'tribal', 'Tragically', 'Hip', 'song', 'Courage', 'main', 'theme.The', 'film', 'measured', 'pace', 'fully', 'feel', 'scene', 'next', 'acting', 'superb', 'understated']",N/A
30451,A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC,078062162X,Eric J. Anderson,"[3, 3]","Don't watch this if you are subject to becoming depressed by sad movies. The Sweet Hereafter is, however, one of those films that has a dreamlike quality that sucks you in. The art of it is very appealing to me. Some will say it is slow, too quiet, a downer. But I think the emotion of it provides more than enough intensity.The movie is based on a novel which is itself somewhat based on a true story of a small town in Texas where tragically many of the town's children were killed in a schoolbus accident, and ambulance-chasing lawyers descended on the town like a swarm of hungry locusts. The townspeople eventually received hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from a company which may or may not have really been responsible for the accident.The movie takes this premise in a different direction. It focuses on one lawyer who comes to town and interviews witnesses, survivors, and moms and dads who lost their kids. The lawyer himself is going through a vaguely similar personal crisis -- losing his daughter to drugs. Great disruption is bubbling in the town because of the tragedy and the impending, potentially enriching, lawsuit. The ending is a surprise, turning everything upside down for a reason that has nothing to do with the accident, and no one will ever likely know the real reason.What is the movie really about? It is about grief turning to boiling anger, mixed with greed. It is about the secret lives of ordinary people in small towns. It is about how justice can be meted out in strange ways.I saw this several years ago, and then again this week.

30453,ACVNA57PI4DLV,078062162X,Francois Tremblay,"[18, 20]","I am dissapointed by movies, as a general rule. Few movies, even independent ones, dare to speak about anything but the obvious. Some movies have great acting and visual style. Others have a structure that enhance the story and themes, or explore uncommonly profound themes. It's rare that one finds all of these things together in one mind-blowing film.The Sweet Hereafter is one such mindblowing film. It is about a terrible bus accident that kills 15 children, although we only see it from afar, and halfway into the movie - the accident is a pivotal temporal point but not the focus. The focus is on the actions surrounding that accident, and what they tell us. All the while, the story is not told in chronological order, but more or less in thematical order. Past, present and future are shuffled effortlessly, because the accident is our anchor to the story.The story concerns many people, but especially one Mitchell Stephens, played by Ian Holm, as a lawyer hired by the Walkers (one of the victimized families) to start a class action lawsuit. He hops from family to family, from evidence to evidence, in increasingly manipulative attempts to rally town inhabitants to his cause, while the sordid secrets of the community threaten to derail him at every turn. A survivor, Nicole, is now handicapped and holds an important testimony.Ian Holm never had a leading role before this movie. Watching his incredible performance, I want to scream bloody murder. He's perfect. That this guy can't get a leading role is mind-bogglingly insane. The other actors, though less well-known, don't unbalance the movie at all.At first, it seems that the movie is a simple left-right conflict, with the hypocrite and conniving community on one hand, and the profiteering lawyer from the big city on the other hand. And it seems that most critics have interpreted it as such, even taking position for one or the other when no such bias is apparent in the movie. I think that says more about their statist political views than it says about the movie.The subtextual richness of this movie is stunning. Using the story of &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot;, it compares Stephens' cynical crusade to channel the parents' anger, as well as the independence-destroying authority of Nicole's father, to the Pied Piper story. In essence, they are leading people to more disaster, the former social and the latter psychological.Stephens' blatant use of invented narrative to coax parents into joining his case brings up the evil uses of storytelling in our society. We see Stephens' desire to lose himself in his case and the town around him, we assume because of her daughter's drug addiction, masterfully played by Iam Holm. The question of responsibility comes up repeatedly, as people's desire to find a guilty party blinds them to the fact that some things are simply accidents. Some of these themes find great resonance in today's lawsuit frenzies used to undermine capitalism.If there is one thing I find lacking in the movie, it is a lack of moral center. Nicole does provide us with a possibly moral action at the end of the movie, which I will not reveal, but the rest of the movie is very morally bleak from a rational perspective. It is not that I found it depressing, but simply morally bleak. Then again, that is what reality is like - as most people lack such moral center and desire to do good, messes like this one are common.The movie was directed by Atom Egoyan, a Canadian director. I'm not a big fan of his, and I didn't like Exotica, but he has to be good to have a movie like this in him. Perhaps the fact that he didn't create this world has something to do with it. As for the movie being Canadian, it is set in British Columbia, and the most obvious indicator of this is that there is no media circus surrounding the whole affair. But written as a fable-like story, it could be set in a great number of places. It is not the accident itself which resonates with the viewer, or the town, but the truth of the movie.",5,A movie resonant with truth,1068508800,"11 11, 2003",2003,4026,"['am', 'dissapointed', 'movies', 'general', 'rule', 'Few', 'movies', 'even', 'independent', 'ones', 'dare', 'speak', 'anything', 'obvious', 'movies', 'have', 'great', 'acting', 'visual', 'style', 'Others', 'have', 'structure', 'story', 'themes', 'explore', 'uncommonly', 'profound', 'themes', 'rare', 'one', 'things', 'together', 'one', 'mind-blowing', 'film.The', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'one', 'such', 'mindblowing', 'film', 'terrible', 'bus', 'accident', '15', 'children', 'only', 'see', 'afar', 'halfway', 'movie', 'accident', 'pivotal', 'temporal', 'point', 'not', 'focus', 'focus', 'actions', 'surrounding', 'accident', 'what', 'tell', 'while', 'story', 'not', 'told', 'chronological', 'order', 'more', 'less', 'thematical', 'order', 'Past', 'present', 'future', 'are', 'shuffled', 'effortlessly', 'accident', 'anchor', 'story.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'many', 'people', 'especially', 'one', 'Mitchell', 'Stephens', 'played', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'lawyer', 'hired', 'Walkers', 'one', 'victimized', 'families', 'start', 'class', 'action', 'lawsuit', 'family', 'family', 'evidence', 'evidence', 'increasingly', 'manipulative', 'attempts', 'rally', 'town', 'inhabitants', 'cause', 'sordid', 'secrets', 'community', 'threaten', 'derail', 'turn', 'survivor', 'Nicole', 'now', 'handicapped', 'important', 'testimony.Ian', 'Holm', 'never', 'had', 'leading', 'role', 'movie', 'Watching', 'incredible', 'performance', 'want', 'scream', 'bloody', 'murder', 'perfect', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'leading', 'role', 'mind-bogglingly', 'insane', 'other', 'actors', 'though', 'less', 'well-known', 'do', ""n't"", 'unbalance', 'movie', 'all.At', 'first', 'movie', 'simple', 'left-right', 'conflict', 'hypocrite', 'conniving', 'community', 'one', 'hand', 'profiteering', 'lawyer', 'big', 'city', 'other', 'hand', 'most', 'critics', 'have', 'interpreted', 'such', 'even', 'taking', 'position', 'one', 'other', 'when', 'such', 'bias', 'apparent', 'movie', 'think', 'more', 'statist', 'political', 'views', 'movie.The', 'subtextual', 'richness', 'movie', 'stunning', 'Using', 'story', 'quot', 'Pied', 'Piper', 'Hamelin', 'quot', 'Stephens', 'cynical', 'crusade', 'channel', 'parents', 'anger', 'as', 'well', 'independence-destroying', 'authority', 'Nicole', 'father', 'Pied', 'Piper', 'story', 'essence', 'are', 'leading', 'people', 'more', 'disaster', 'former', 'social', 'latter', 'psychological.Stephens', 'blatant', 'use', 'invented', 'narrative', 'coax', 'parents', 'joining', 'case', 'up', 'evil', 'uses', 'storytelling', 'society', 'see', 'Stephens', 'desire', 'lose', 'case', 'town', 'assume', 'daughter', 'drug', 'addiction', 'masterfully', 'played', 'Iam', 'Holm', 'question', 'responsibility', 'up', 'repeatedly', 'people', 'desire', 'find', 'guilty', 'party', 'fact', 'things', 'are', 'simply', 'accidents', 'themes', 'find', 'great', 'resonance', 'today', 'lawsuit', 'frenzies', 'used', 'undermine', 'capitalism.If', 'one', 'thing', 'find', 'lacking', 'movie', 'lack', 'moral', 'center', 'Nicole', 'provide', 'possibly', 'moral', 'action', 'end', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'rest', 'movie', 'very', 'morally', 'bleak', 'rational', 'perspective', 'not', 'found', 'depressing', 'simply', 'morally', 'bleak', 'Then', 'again', 'what', 'reality', 'like', 'most', 'people', 'lack', 'such', 'moral', 'center', 'desire', 'do', 'good', 'messes', 'one', 'are', 'common.The', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'Canadian', 'director', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'did', ""n't"", 'Exotica', 'be', 'good', 'have', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'create', 'world', 'something', 'do', 'movie', 'being', 'Canadian', 'set', 'British', 'Columbia', 'most', 'obvious', 'indicator', 'media', 'circus', 'surrounding', 'whole', 'affair', 'written', 'fable-like', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'set', 'great', 'number', 'places', 'not', 'accident', 'viewer', 'town', 'truth', 'movie']",N/A

30456,A37I6V22T4B6QT,078062162X,Futoshi J. Tomori,"[6, 7]","Director Atom Egoyan has been making movies that resemble philosophical systems:  cold, remote, and impenetrable.  With The Sweet Hereafter, the Armenian-Canadian filmmaker appears to have a change of heart.  When the  camera stares at a bus driver recounting her side of the story, he's going  for some kind of emotional punch there, however slight.  The Sweet  Hereafter concerns the tragedy of a small Canadian town when a school bus  filled with its children fall into a frozen lake.  All but one of them  drown.  And like the ice cracking all around the doomed bus, the narrative  splinters in all directions, backward and forward in time.  Meanwhile for  the parents, the tragedy becomes an unyielding present as they are reminded  of their loss constantly, everyday, henceforth.  The movie is about the  powerful bond parents have for their children; That however estranged they  become of each other, an inexplicable connection, both torturous and  tender, still remains.  There are two competing storytellers in the  movie.  First, there is the narrator, the big city lawyer who has come to  town to solicit clients.  It is his story of love and loss that dominates  and frames the movie.  Next, there's the young adolescent girl who begins  to challenge the lawyer's master narrative.  She is able to captivate a  small crowd with her songs or two youngsters as she reads them a prophetic  fairy tale.  In the pivotal scene of the movie, the young storyteller  takes charge of her life by wrestling away the storytelling prowess of the  lawyer and from her father.  She turns a moment of tragedy into a locus of  personal empowerment.  But then again there is a third storyteller in the  proceedings.  Thefilmmaker  who also appears as the primary, magical  storyteller.  Egoyan cuts up the teenage girl's reading of the Pied Piper  tale into smaller pieces and inserts them into the fragments of past and  present, creating an effct of mysterious thematic resonance.  (Egoyan is a  master of film form.)  While in his last film, Exotica, a moment in the  past fuels the narrative drive of the movie, in The Sweet Hereafter, it is  the present, in the ability of an individual to tell her own tale and thus  lead her own life, that drives the movie's direction.  Both movies are  meditations on loss and lingering effect it has on our lives.  But the  latter movie is also about love, the love we have for our children.  Think  of the movie as a custody battle between the children's biological parents  and their spiritual one.  Tragic theatre, according to Nietzsche, is the  life and soul of a culture as it asks pertinent questions about the values  of the society.  &quot;What happened to our children?&quot;  this movie  seems to be asking.  (This is a relevant question to ask in the wake of the  student killings in Colorado.)  With The Sweet Hereafter, Egoyan has  forgone his pet themes of film on film but none of the skills in presenting  a tale that goes beyond the realm of the explicable:  the nature and limits  of filial love, the burden of guilt when there is no one to blame, and this  obstinate will to live.  Not only is the movie intellectually rigorous and  emotionally honest, but it also reveals the role of the filmmaker as a  magical storyteller, a tribal seer of sorts, interpeting a community's  constellation of desire and despair, dreams and nightmares.",5,Bedtime Story,924912000,"04 24, 1999",1999,3394,"['Director', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'been', 'making', 'movies', 'resemble', 'philosophical', 'systems', 'cold', 'remote', 'impenetrable', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'Armenian-Canadian', 'filmmaker', 'have', 'change', 'heart', 'When', 'camera', 'bus', 'driver', 'recounting', 'side', 'story', 'going', 'kind', 'emotional', 'punch', 'there', 'however', 'slight', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'tragedy', 'small', 'Canadian', 'town', 'when', 'school', 'bus', 'filled', 'children', 'fall', 'frozen', 'lake', 'one', 'drown', 'ice', 'cracking', 'doomed', 'bus', 'narrative', 'splinters', 'directions', 'backward', 'forward', 'time', 'Meanwhile', 'parents', 'tragedy', 'unyielding', 'present', 'are', 'reminded', 'loss', 'constantly', 'everyday', 'henceforth', 'movie', 'powerful', 'bond', 'parents', 'have', 'children', 'however', 'estranged', 'become', 'other', 'inexplicable', 'connection', 'torturous', 'tender', 'still', 'are', 'two', 'competing', 'storytellers', 'movie', 'First', 'narrator', 'big', 'city', 'lawyer', 'who', 'come', 'town', 'solicit', 'clients', 'story', 'love', 'loss', 'movie', 'Next', 'young', 'adolescent', 'girl', 'who', 'challenge', 'lawyer', 'master', 'narrative', 'able', 'captivate', 'small', 'crowd', 'songs', 'two', 'youngsters', 'prophetic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'movie', 'young', 'storyteller', 'charge', 'life', 'wrestling', 'away', 'storytelling', 'prowess', 'lawyer', 'father', 'moment', 'tragedy', 'locus', 'personal', 'empowerment', 'then', 'again', 'third', 'storyteller', 'proceedings', 'Thefilmmaker', 'who', 'also', 'primary', 'magical', 'storyteller', 'Egoyan', 'up', 'teenage', 'girl', 'reading', 'Pied', 'Piper', 'tale', 'smaller', 'pieces', 'inserts', 'fragments', 'past', 'present', 'creating', 'effct', 'mysterious', 'thematic', 'resonance', 'Egoyan', 'master', 'film', 'form', 'last', 'film', 'Exotica', 'moment', 'past', 'fuels', 'narrative', 'drive', 'movie', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'present', 'ability', 'individual', 'tell', 'own', 'tale', 'thus', 'lead', 'own', 'life', 'movie', 'direction', 'movies', 'are', 'meditations', 'loss', 'lingering', 'effect', 'lives', 'latter', 'movie', 'also', 'about', 'love', 'love', 'have', 'children', 'Think', 'movie', 'custody', 'battle', 'children', 'biological', 'parents', 'spiritual', 'one', 'Tragic', 'theatre', 'according', 'Nietzsche', 'life', 'soul', 'culture', 'pertinent', 'questions', 'values', 'society', 'quot', 'What', 'happened', 'children', 'quot', 'movie', 'be', 'asking', 'relevant', 'question', 'ask', 'wake', 'student', 'killings', 'Colorado', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'Egoyan', 'forgone', 'pet', 'themes', 'film', 'film', 'none', 'skills', 'presenting', 'tale', 'realm', 'explicable', 'nature', 'limits', 'filial', 'love', 'burden', 'guilt', 'when', 'one', 'blame', 'obstinate', 'will', 'live', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 'intellectually', 'rigorous', 'emotionally', 'honest', 'also', 'role', 'filmmaker', 'magical', 'storyteller', 'tribal', 'seer', 'sorts', 'interpeting', 'community', 'constellation', 'desire', 'despair', 'dreams', 'nightmares']",N/A

Director Atom Egoyan handles a difficult subject and knows how to develop an interesting and thought-provocking approach.The basic story is about the aftermath of a school bus accident that led to the death of 14 children. An attourney (Ian Holm) then tries to find out who was the responsible for such dramatic and unfortunate incident, looking for clear answers but failing to achieve them.Was it really just an accident? Why did it happen? Was it that surprising and unexpected? These are some of the questions that the lawyer tries to find answers to, so he starts looking for them in the little, calm and peaceful canadian village where the disaster happened.As the lawyer`s quest unfolds, Egoyan shows us his motivations, giving a glipse about his relationship with his drug-addicted daughter that he is unable to help.&quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; is a powerful story about loss and frustration in a world where parents can`t seem to help their children, dreams start to fade and hope is destroyed. But it`s also a story told in a realistic and credible way, avoiding easy melodramatic devices and dramatic overacting. Egoyan doesn`t offer a tearjerker session here, given that his approach is subtle, letting hope and reconstruction unfold.The storytelling techniques are unique, given that the plot development isn`t linear and mixes three different timeframes that are related and co-dependent. The movie also presents an ethereal, hypnotic and dream-like atmosphere, creating a particular and unique feel, although it never loses its realistic elements.

Thy've have just lost 14 of their children in the crash of their school bus which we see in surreal fashion as we're spard the chaos that must hav ben occurring inside.The families are visited by Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm), a lawyer who is attracted to the case because of his ongoing suffering due to a daughter addicted to drugs who calls him collect on his cell phone frequently.  He'd like to channel the townspeople's and his rage with a class-action lawsuit. He is the classic outsider offering a form of salvation whether they want it or not.  His interviews with the families and survivors open up windows into some of the town's relationships and screts that many would like to stay hidden.The most significant schoolbus survivor is Nicole, a teenager now crippled for life. In this movie we see the contrast between the horror of the accident and the average lives of its victims.Mitchell wins the confidence of most of the townspeople as he builds his lawsuit, pumping himself up to win their cooperation, only to sag under the weight of his own personal sadness whenever he leaves them.This troubled lawyer builds his case. &quot;There is no such thing as an accident; somewhere, someone decided to cut a corner,&quot; he rails. Blaming the town, the bus company, and the school board, Stephens presents himself as the one person who knows what is best for the families. When he says, &quot;I will sue for negligence until they bleed,&quot; his own rage is leaking from his heart. When he adds, &quot;Let me direct your rage,&quot; his own rage is joining a class action looking for an outlet. Ian Holm, as always, plays in subtle tones, and toys repeatedly with the unexpected. He is marvelously incapable of creating a stereotypical lawyer.There is no sentimentality to this movie, a real feat considering the subject. Atom Egoyan was after something much deeper, a sense of community, perhaps, or the dreariness of the ordinary. His characters are outsiders moving about the edges of their community. None of them is especially likeable. A viewer looking for engagement with these people is likely to be disappointed; but it is precisely that quality that allows us to think dispassionately about loss and resilience, about moments of bravery summoned from mediocrity. Whenever you think of loss from now on, it's a safe bet that Atom Egoyan's horrific, silent vision of the yellow school bus skidding on the frozen lake will haunt your thoughts.",4,Sad but unforgettable,1010966400,"01 14, 2002",2002,2569,"['ordinary', 'people', 'blindsided', 'disaster', 'affecting', 'entire', 'rural', 'British', 'Columbian', 'town', 'Thy', ""'ve"", 'have', 'just', 'lost', '14', 'children', 'crash', 'school', 'bus', 'see', 'surreal', 'fashion', ""'re"", 'chaos', 'must', 'hav', 'ben', 'occurring', 'inside.The', 'families', 'are', 'visited', 'Mitchell', 'Stephens', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'lawyer', 'who', 'attracted', 'case', 'ongoing', 'suffering', 'due', 'daughter', 'addicted', 'drugs', 'who', 'collect', 'cell', 'phone', 'frequently', ""'d"", 'like', 'channel', 'townspeople', 'rage', 'class-action', 'lawsuit', 'classic', 'outsider', 'offering', 'form', 'salvation', 'want', 'not', 'interviews', 'families', 'survivors', 'open', 'up', 'windows', 'town', 'relationships', 'screts', 'many', 'would', 'like', 'stay', 'hidden.The', 'most', 'significant', 'schoolbus', 'survivor', 'Nicole', 'teenager', 'now', 'crippled', 'life', 'movie', 'see', 'contrast', 'horror', 'accident', 'average', 'lives', 'victims.Mitchell', 'confidence', 'most', 'townspeople', 'lawsuit', 'pumping', 'win', 'cooperation', 'only', 'sag', 'weight', 'own', 'personal', 'sadness', 'whenever', 'them.This', 'troubled', 'lawyer', 'case', 'quot', 'such', 'thing', 'accident', 'somewhere', 'someone', 'decided', 'cut', 'corner', 'quot', 'Blaming', 'town', 'bus', 'company', 'school', 'board', 'Stephens', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'what', 'best', 'families', 'When', 'quot', 'will', 'sue', 'negligence', 'bleed', 'quot', 'own', 'rage', 'leaking', 'heart', 'When', 'quot', 'Let', 'direct', 'rage', 'quot', 'own', 'rage', 'joining', 'class', 'action', 'looking', 'outlet', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'always', 'plays', 'subtle', 'tones', 'repeatedly', 'unexpected', 'marvelously', 'incapable', 'creating', 'stereotypical', 'lawyer.There', 'sentimentality', 'movie', 'real', 'feat', 'considering', 'subject', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'was', 'something', 'much', 'deeper', 'sense', 'community', 'perhaps', 'dreariness', 'ordinary', 'characters', 'are', 'outsiders', 'moving', 'edges', 'community', 'None', 'especially', 'likeable', 'viewer', 'looking', 'engagement', 'people', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'precisely', 'quality', 'think', 'dispassionately', 'loss', 'resilience', 'moments', 'bravery', 'summoned', 'mediocrity', 'Whenever', 'think', 'loss', 'now', 'safe', 'bet', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'horrific', 'silent', 'vision', 'yellow', 'school', 'bus', 'skidding', 'frozen', 'lake', 'will', 'haunt', 'thoughts']",N/A
30463,A1JF8PSY0NPSYY,078062162X,Jeffery K. Matheus,"[16, 18]","What can I say about &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;? Well, without hyperbole, Canadian director Atom Egoyan has basically turned Russel Banks popular novel into one of the most touching and masterfully-crafted films ever made! This is the story of smalltown tragedy in British Columbia. Fourteen schoolchildren are killed in a freak school bus accident, and their families, friends, and neighbors, each devestated in their own way, tries to carry on with their lives. A manipulative laywer (played with stark intensity by Ian Holm) comes to the town to try to organize a class action lawsuit, but the lawyer is carrying some emotional baggage of his own, and Egoyan creates some beautiful plot &quot;counterpoint&quot; by weaving the townpeople's and the lawyers tragedies together. Egoyan takes what COULD have been fodder for another melodramatic Hollywood tearjerker, and turns it into a film of great depth and substance. Egoyan has a wonderfully lyrical sense of film composition, and he masterfully intermixes scenes from the present, with flashbacks to the past, and slowly unviels the the complex lives of his characters (including some even deeper tragedies than the bus accident!) Ever the innovator, Egoyan even manages to blend spoken poetry into the story, as Robert Browning's &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot; is used as a powerfully symbolic conterpoint to the story we are seeing on  screen. The whole cast is quite excellent, but young Canadian actress Sarah Polley (as the pivotal character of Nicole, a would-be rock singer and survivor of the bus crash) just about steals the show! I won't give away one of the film's most surprising plot-points (although some Amazon reviewers have already let the cat out of the bag), but I will just say that Polley's dazed facial expression near the end of the story is a beatiful piece of acting...and speaks volumes more than any big, convoluted Hollywood &quot;comeuppance&quot; scene could ever achieve! &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; is a film that should not be missed by any film buff! I have seen this film at least five times now and I can attest that it only gets better with repeated vieweings, there is simply too much going on underneath the surface of the story to absorb all of it's issues on the first glance. This very &quot;human&quot; film is the complete antithesis of everything that is wrong with the current Hollywood scene, and with this emotionally gripping film, Atom Egoyan has cemented his place among the world's finest filmmakers!",5,Atom Egoyan's beautiful tragedy!

a bus accident, a big city lawyer convinces many of the townsfolk to bring about a negligence suit against whomever is responsible. meanwhile, two years later the same lawyer has to confront his own emotions and history with his addicted daughter while meeting one of her childhood friends on an airplane.rarely does a film with so many critical characters finish successfully. in one way or another some of the characters get left by the wayside in favor of others until they all become a rambled mess the viewer is left scrambling through, growing more frustrated with each moment. but sweet hereafter actually pulls it off. four townsfolk, mitchell, mitchell's daughter, and mitchell's daugherts' childhood friends are all (in varying degrees) crucial to the story, and all are developed as

cinematogaphy, and sweet hereafter most certainly does not. the action takes place in front of and alongside snow-capped moutneain peaks and country roads. it is a majestically beautiful landscape.still, these succeses pale in comparison to the editing. just as kevin smith's movie rely on dialogue, and american beauty relied on cinematography to pull them over fan humps, sweet hereafter uses sound and film editing. by interweaving two different time periods, and two different stories, as well as various voice overs, editing moves the film along--making it watchable. without careful attention to where and when scenes were place, this movie would have very easily failed. the same can be said for the directing. shot scales change precisely when they're meant to, actors appear comfortable and confident, and difficult subject matter is handled easily and calmly.still, the movie is not a smashing success. it is slow-moving, relying on identification with characters and trust in the director (and editor's) ultimate vision to keep the viewer interested. it is also initially a bit confusing, using too little exposition. finally, there is one (not unexplained) but underdeveloped (perhaps even undeveloped) strand of tabboo that gets too little attention paid to it. this is jarring and confusing, and a little disenchanting.still, sweet hereafter is definitly

30469,A34D06JL7LC6MU,078062162X,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 5]","Writer/Director Atom Egoyan ('Where the Truth Lies') presents us here with an adaptation of a novel by Russell Banks that recieved spectacular reviews and was called by some people the best film of 1997. I disagree, I'm a ""As Good As It Gets"" fan...What can I say? Oddly enough, the typical DVD supplier will not have this movie in stock. Oh and also, a lot of people haven't even heard of this movie which is a shame as well. This is a powerful, emotional, and highly entertaining film that, to me, ranks as one of Egoyan's best. Ian Holm ('Lord of War') in the best performance I've seen him in plays Mitchell Stephens, a lawyer who travels to a small rural town somewhere in Canada. This is something that I think viewers shouldn't know about until they start watching the movie, but chances are if you're reading this review...You already know this. The reason Stephens is going into the town is because a school bus accident has claimed a large number of the town's childrens lives. Only two survivors remain; the bus driver Mrs. Driscoll and a young girl named Nicole (Sarah Polley). The film jumps back and forth; To future, past, and present with virtually no warning as to where we're being taken. In fact, there's one point it turns out we don't even know what time slot we're in until the end. Anyway, as far as the plot there's not a lot more to say. Stephens descends upom the town to fill a class action negligence lawsuit and gets most of the towns approval, but there's one character who prefers that the lawsuit be forgotten about. There's also the sub-plot about our protagonists own demons involving his drug addicted daughter Zoe. While my synopsis might not be striking your interest to the effect I'm trying to achieve, I think everyone really needs to see this movie. The performances are so powerful, the dialogue/speeches are so good; The movie's shocking, deep, powerful, and truly...Amazing.

The children have disappeared to The Sweet Hereafter from a school bus accident.Why? How? What could have possibly caused this to happen? As The Pied Piper lead his townschildren away from the harm of the adults, so too these children in rustic Canada have gone on to peace. This is the story of THE SWEET HEREAFTER.Lawyer Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm) comes to this close-knit (almost closed) town to investigate the accident and to offer the promise of financial retribution to the parents of the dead children. What follows is a very slow and methodical look at the secrets that are hidden within the lives of the people. On the outside, everything looks picture perfect; but as this film unfolds we discover, in a very poignant way, the really dark undercurrents that lie beneath the surface of the townspeople who ""always act as a community."" One teenage girl,Nicole (Sarah Polley who just triumphed in her 2006 directorial debut in AWAY FROM HER)is the sole remaining child alive, and she knows the town's secrets. She has a painful one of her own.Does she expose all of those secrets or does she remain mute or lie? As Lawyer Stephens probes into the accident, the dark and deep wounds of his own relationship with his drug-addicted daughter are painfully and gradually brought to the surface.This film has so much to say about children-what they see, hear,observe and know.It grants intellect and wisdom to the characters of children who, though innocents, supposedly, are capable of perceiving adult action and feeling the deep effects of it. The children are the real subjects of this film, and yet they have so little screen time, apart from Nicole, who is the ""left-behind"" lame child who speaks (or may not speak) for all of those who are injured by adult actions. This film is so sly and subtle that to miss one glance or one picture on the wall or one passing remark reduces the entire impact of what this film has to say.Adults have agendas...and children know it!!!!This film is a stinging indictment on adult frivolity and the keen observation of the innocent.This film was especially relevant to my ""wonder years"" as sexual abuse, drunkenness,manipulation and dark secrets were THE major mode of operation in our family.

It portrays a tragic school bus accident and its aftermath.  Set in Canada, the movie features a personal injury attorney who visits the small town to enlist families to file injury claims and wrongful death lawsuits against any deep pocket he can conjure.Preferably, these deep pockets should be some party other than the local School Board, since compensation by the school board has already been paid.  As a result, the attorney fancifully postulates lawsuits against the bus manufacturer, the guard rail company, et cetera.  In fact, why not sue God for allowing snow to fall in creating a slick and icy road surface?Part of my quandary is that, from what (little, admittedly) I know about Canadian liability law, jackpot justice in big jury awards the likes of which we have in United States is very uncommon.  There does not seem to be the lottery mentality in the tort system in Canada as exists in the good old U.S. of A.Ian Holm does a masterful job as the attorney attempting to sign up clients, a process which creates divisions and fissures within the townsfolk, who previously felt a greater sense of community.  It is tempting to dislike the attorney, except when we catch glimpses of his own tormented relationship with his wayward daughter, who periodically calls him from pay-phone booths trying to hit him up for money.

Looney,"[0, 1]","...and I must say I'm much more pleased with Egoyan's conversion of Russell Banks' novel to the screen than I was with his previous effort on William Trevor's FELICIA'S JOURNEY.  This time out, the director has taken fewer liberties with the original - and the changes/additions he has made (most notably the inclusion of Robert Browning's poem `The pied piper of Hamelin' as a metaphor) are respectful to the novel's theme and mood, and very effective.Ian Holm is outstanding as lawyer Mitchell Stephens, coming into a small town in the wake of a tragic school bus accident to try to rally the grieving survivors into a group lawsuit.  The residents are very suspicious of him, leery of his motives - some are resentful and even aggressive towards him, still stinging from their sorrow and loss, feeling a need to lash out at something - anything - in their pain.  He makes a nice target.  Stephens has problems of his own - mainly, a drug-addicted, rebellious daughter who calls him only when she needs money. Trying to balance his personal woes with his career has obviously taken a toll on him, both physically and emotionally.  Dedicated to the task at hand - as he sees his work - he sets about attempting to uncover the facts surrounding the accident.This is where one of the film's central themes comes into play - what exactly is the truth?  As we can see in this case, it depends on who's telling the story.  One of the unique aspects of Banks' original novel - preserved nicely in the screenplay - is the viewing of the events from four different angles.  Each person remembers and sees things in a different way, reflected not only in their position at the time of the accident, but by events and emotions at play within their own lives.  This is shown most poignantly, I think, in the part of the story that deals with Nicole, a high school girl who dreams of becoming a singing star.  Left paralyzed by the accident, she feels that her dreams of her career - and her life - have been shattered.  She reevaluates the relationship she has with her father - and the anger and pain that surfaces find their release in one of the film's most electrifying moments.  Sarah Polley portrays this young woman with sensitivity and skill - she is completely honest and believable in her role.Egoyan's screenplay tells Banks' story well - the film is intelligent and entertaining, and gives the audience much to think about:  the meaning of the `truth' as viewed from different angles, as well as the methods by which humans deal with pain, loss, suffering and love.

30478,A1L43KWWR05PCS,078062162X,Lawyeraau,"[0, 0]","This film is compelling in its storytelling, peeling back layer after layer of human emotion, until all that is left is that which is primal. Beautifully nuanced, if somewhat ponderously slow at times, this film is not for the action oriented viewer. It is a film for the more patient and discerning viewer, the one who will allow the story to unfold in its own good time. It is this viewer who will derive the most enjoyment from this cinematic gem.The story is really several stories that are threaded into one tapestry of events. The main thread involves a school bus accident that resulted in the death of fourteen children in a small British Columia town in Canada. A big, city slicker lawyer, Mitchell Stevens (Ian Holm), waltzes into town on the heels of the tragedy to see if a class action suit, arising out of the bus accident, lies against someone, anyone for huge monetary damages.As Stevens interviews those prospective clients, his own troubles are revealed to the viewer and center around his drug addicted daughter, who deftly manipulates him. Scenes with his daughter, which suggest just how out of control his daughter's life is, correlate nicely to the way the lives of the townspeople have spun out of control since the bus accident that took so many young lives. Stevens is as bereft as the townspeople who have lost their children. The lawyer's feeling of guilt over his daughter's seemingly hopeless condition, miirror the hopelessness felt by the townspeople in light of the overwhelming tragedy that has befallen them.The town has its secrets, however. One of them involves an attractive, and talented teenager, Nichole (Sarah Polley). When the viewer first sees her, with her is a long haired, seemingly supportive and tender man. For some inexplicable reason the viewer may take him for her boyfriend, even though all they are doing is eating ice cream, only to discover that he is actually her father. Like the lawyer, Nichole must contend with a very personal and secret tragedy in her young life.The brief scene that makes clear the true nature of Nichole's relationship with her father is shown in a way that belies its inherent corruption. It seemlessly transitions its way into the film, and the viewer really has to think twice about that which the viewer has just seen, as the setting seems almost romantic, a setting that belies the profound putrescence of the reality of the scene.The threads of the film's story are woven in such a way that time and scene shifts are somewhat abrupt and may seem a little disjointed to the viewer, which has the net effect of keeping the viewer a little off balance. The tenor of the film, however, is set to perfection by Nichole's monotone voice over reading of Robert Browning's lyrical poem, ""The Pied Piper of Hamlin"". Her reading gives the viewer a feeling of alienation and despair. It also leaves the viewer wondering whether the pied piper is an allusion to her father or the lawyer. Watch the film, and you be the judge.Ian Holm, Sarah Polley, and this cast of mostly unknowns, give wonderful performances worthy of note, compelling and moving. The film, as does an onion, has many layers to be peeled back. It is a film to be savored and viewed again and again.

It's a rare work that's so artfully driven and crafted with such heavy emphasis on symbolism that it makes a stark contrast against the hordes of mainstream films made purely for entertainment - and so it's perhaps inevitable that each person will come away with something quite different.I hate to generalize so broadly, but essentially those that are looking to be purely entertained have the least likelihood of enjoying this film. While those that enjoy a bit of meditation with their entertainment, those who get a kick out of reading between the lines, and those who enjoy films from the likes of Bergman and Fellini will probably find themselves robbed of speech for a moment as they watch the credits begin to roll.I admit it took me several viewings before everything began to sink into place for me, but I've come to appreciate this film as one of the most underrated films of last decade.

Atom Egoyan will be remembered for several of his films, but this is the one that everyone will talk about for years to come.  The interwoven themes of loss, hope, grief and redemption are so artfully fused as to defy belief.  The use of time shifts is integral in this fusion and it is done so skillfully that it is close to impossible to think of another film that betters that technique.The story of a devastating tragedy that has killed a number of school children in a bus accident, it also focuses on Mitchell Stevens, the lawyer who has come to the small Canadian town where the accident occurred to assist the grieving parents of the dead children in reclaiming what may be due them financially based on negligence causing the accident.  Yet Stevens has his own agenda, and it is an equally powerful one--the spiritual and physical decay of his daughter, lost to drugs.  Not lost as in dead, but lost as in addicted, beyond help.Were this only a tale of tragedy, it would have nowhere near the impact that it does.  It is much more than that.  It is about what we all can see, if we look hard enough, in our lives that gives us the strength to move beyond what can bring us down.  It is about how we can live past and through the times that shatter our existence.Were this a tale only of the vices that surface here--incest, adultery, lying, pride--it would be an all-too-familiar grocery list of man's sins.  But it is the context in which these sins occur--how the sinners and those sinned against cope with them--that gives this film its astounding power.Now, more than ever, this is a drama that speaks to all of us, and while that may sound cliched, it is nevertheless true.  This is a tale of moral courage--of those who have it, of those who struggle for it, and of those who have lost it.  This is the quality that makes us, more than anything else, what we are.  And what we can be.If I could give this ten stars, I would.

A lawyer, who in a way, has lost his own daughter too, is visiting the town. He tries to persuade the victims' parents, to join in a class action lawsuit.Through his visit, we gradually learn about the people's lonely and sad lives before and after the accident. We also realize how this case is just the outlet of the anger the lawyer feels about his own life.The film is really depressing, but it achieves in that you never feel manipulated. Its director, Atom Egoyan, helped by a superb script, never goes for the easy tears and cheap emotions.As for the cast, Ian Holm, portraying the lawyer, and Sarah Polley (also starring in ""Go!""), who plays a survivor of the accident, stand out. Holm is a revelation in a monologue, describing the incident when his daughter almost died of a spider bite. Polley uses her expressive face and eyes extensively, to reveal all her troubled emotions.Other high points of the film include the excellent music score which follows faithfully the atmosphere, the photography, with the images of the surrounding frozen mountains, providing a successful parallelism with the parents' tortured psyches, and the use of Robert Browning's poem ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin"" as a powerful metaphor.",5,A Genuine Look of Life after Tragedy,1032652800,"09 22, 2002",2002,1559,"['Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'honest', 'realistic', 'movie', 'subtle', 'way', 'strong', 'emotions', 'anger', 'grief', 'end', 'give', 'glimpse', 'hope.It', 'story', 'small', 'town', 'Canada', 'tragic', 'bus', 'accident', 'losing', 'most', 'children', 'result', 'losing', 'much', 'happiness', 'joy', 'lawyer', 'who', 'way', 'lost', 'own', 'daughter', 'too', 'visiting', 'town', 'persuade', 'victims', 'parents', 'join', 'class', 'action', 'visit', 'gradually', 'learn', 'people', 'lonely', 'sad', 'lives', 'accident', 'also', 'realize', 'how', 'case', 'just', 'outlet', 'anger', 'lawyer', 'feels', 'own', 'life.The', 'film', 'really', 'depressing', 'never', 'feel', 'manipulated', 'director', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'helped', 'superb', 'script', 'never', 'easy', 'tears', 'cheap', 'emotions.As', 'cast', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'portraying', 'lawyer', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'also', 'starring', 'Go', 'who', 'survivor', 'accident', 'stand', 'out', 'Holm', 'revelation', 'monologue', 'describing', 'incident', 'when', 'daughter', 'almost', 'died', 'spider', 'bite', 'Polley', 'expressive', 'face', 'eyes', 'extensively', 'reveal', 'troubled', 'emotions.Other', 'high', 'points', 'film', 'include', 'excellent', 'music', 'score', 'faithfully', 'atmosphere', 'photography', 'images', 'surrounding', 'frozen', 'mountains', 'providing', 'successful', 'parallelism', 'parents', 'tortured', 'psyches', 'use', 'Robert', 'Browning', 'poem', 'Pied', 'Piper', 'Hamelin', 'powerful', 'metaphor']",N/A

The movie portrays human beings as they can really be--greedy, confused after a huge tragic loss, in denial of guilt and more. The plot moves along at a good pace and the storyline is absolutely fascinating. Unfortunately, this movie is not for everyone since the plot is rather haunting and dark; this is anything but a family film. The actors do a superb job and the cinematography is excellent.When the action begins, an ambulance chasing lawyer Mitchell Stevens (played by Ian Holm) races up to a small Canadian town after a school bus accident has cost the lives of most of the small town's children. Mitchell approaches the townsfolk to build a huge lawsuit against the people whom he believes he can determine to be guilty for having caused the accident. Perhaps the school bus wasn't regularly maintained--or maybe the manufacturer of the bus used poor quality bolts; Mitchell doesn't care, he just wants a piece of the action.Of course, some embrace the idea of a lawsuit--but yet others want to forget about any trial and they make no bones about it. In particular, look for Tom McCamus who plays Sam Burnell, a father with a dirty secret and Sarah Polley plays Sam's daughter Nicole. While Sam wants the lawsuit to pay medical bills and probably make a buck off this lemon, his daughter Nicole is not so comfortable with this idea. We come to see that so many of the townsfolk have dark secrets of their own; and even the lawyer Mitchell Stevens has a rather troubled relationship with his daughter Zo (played wonderfully by Caerthan Banks). There is also the very emotionally scarred bus driver who survived the accident, Dolores Discolt (Gabrielle Rose), who eventually makes it plain that she doesn't want to be judged in a court of law by a jury made up of people who don't know her at all.As secrets and the rest of the plot unfold, questions arise: Will Dolores change her mind about the lawsuit and want it after all? What about the father of two children who saw the tragedy as he followed the bus in his pickup--will Billy (Bruce Greenwood) ever change his mind and decide a lawsuit is a good idea? And what about Mitchell's own relationship with his daughter Zo--is there any hope for things to get better between the two of them? Keep an eye out for excellent, practically seamless flashbacks and flash forwards that really impress me with just how smoothly they are woven into the film.The DVD comes with a plethora of extras: we get an audio commentary by film director Adam Egoyan; and there is a Charlie Rose interview with Egoyan as well. I especially liked the ""Q & A"" extra with several members of the cast.  We even get some biographies and filmographies, too.All in all, The Sweet Hereafter is an excellent film that I highly recommend. Reserve it for a time when you can handle a heavy film about people and how they can truly be when confronted with a seemingly insurmountable loss.

Oleson,"[1, 2]","While I've not been an enthusiastic fan of director Atom Egoyan's previous efforts (""Exotica,"" ""Chloe,"" ""Adoration"") I admit to being fascinated by his style.  This may be the best film of those I've seen.  Attorney Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm) travels to a small town in a wintered British Columbia.  He is seeking plaintiffs to file a lawsuit following a harrowing accident involving a school bus.  The bus plunged down a steep hill onto a frozen lake.  Unfortunately the ice didn't hold and a dozen or so children perished.  Only a couple survived including the driver and a high school student (Sarah Polley).Stephens has problems beyond making a legal case.  He is constantly called by his adult daughter who is strung out and HIV positive.  Egoyan takes his time developing the characters, all who have lost children in the tragedy.  None are particularly enthusiastic about pursuing legal action but Stephens has a way of bringing out the anger about the loss that he uses to get their agreement.  Billy Ansell (reliable Bruce Greenwood) who lost twins doesn't want to pursue the action.  He wants to collectively support each other ""as they always have"" and not testify against false charges.  Ultimately the movie is a fine character study in behavior.  There are no bad guys, just people trying to live their lives.

30489,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,078062162X,Only-A-Child,"[4, 4]","In ""The Sweet Hereafter"" director Atom Egoyan expands on his view of the free will versus destiny argument. As in his earlier film ""Exotica"", exercise of free will is generally limited to the choice of substitutes. The process of living being simply a process of substitution. We grow out of things and find substitutes for them. We lose something precious but we carry on by finding a substitute. We need something we can't have so we find something that works as a substitute. Sometimes the substitutes are an improvement on the original, sometimes they are a better match with a new stage of life, sometimes they are an imperfect substitute but the best that we can manage, and sometimes (certainly in ""The Sweet Hereafter"") they can become an addictive trap that keep people from moving on.Substitutes that signal an acceptance of the need/opportunity for change are generally positive. The Otto's substitute an adopted child for the son they can't have biologically, Billy's affair with Risa is a substitute for his dead wife and he is a substitute for her inattentive husband. Billy's children substitute Nicole for their absent mother. Delores substitutes the children on her bus for the children she has been unable to have.Not so positive are substitutes that inadequately compensate for the unattainable. Mitchell Stephens serves as a victims' advocate as a substitute for his inability to influence his daughter's self-destructive behavior, his zeal to compensate impairs his basic humanity and good judgement. And the vicarious thrill Sam gets from his daughter's musical career is a substitute for his failure to achieve that kind of success.But the most dysfunctional substitutes in ""The Sweet Hereafter"" are those chosen as a way to ""delay"" acceptance of a change. Sam's incest is a way for him to delay confronting the fact that he is growing old. The initiation of legal action over the accident is not just a way to release anger but a way to delay acceptance of the loss and of having to confront living without the children. Billy has already been through the grieving process and understands that delay is a bad idea.But Egoyan also wants us to understand that while we can freely choose our substitutes, we are subject to random events that are beyond our control. Some of these are accidents, with varying degrees of human complicity; some are just events that happen outside human control. Like those who die on the ""Bridge of San Luis Rey"", there was a randomness about the victims on the school bus. Some survived the accident itself, Jenny stayed home sick that day, and Danny begged to stay home but was placed on the bus by his mother.Stephen's story about rushing his three-year old daughter to the hospital is inserted for a reason. He recalls being willing to do whatever had to be done to save her life. He still feels that way but is powerless to change her downward spiral, and consumed by guilt over his real or imagined contributions to her mental state. He cannot help her so his substitute is to help real and imagined victims.  Symbolized by the broken car wash, Zoe's rejuvenation is impossible, as is his until he accepts what he cannot control and no longer needs to compensate with a substitute. Like Stevens the town must accept what has occurred and learn to live in the strange new childless place that it has become. Look to the movie's title.Foreshadowing occurs when Risa comments to Billy that his following the schoolbus gives his children something to look forward to, just as the two of them look forward to their motel room hook-ups. Sam and Nicole look forward to their rock concert fantesy ""kissy"" sessions by candlelight in the barn. And a community's children are its looking forward factor.Robert Browning's ""The Pied Piper of Hamlin"" - is inserted at various points in the story as a counterpoint for the town's three pipers. 1)Mitchell Stephens has come to rain ruin on this town by seducing the townspeople with the prospect of delaying their acceptance of the tragedy.  2)Sam has seduced his daughter with a fantasy that played upon her desire for his love. But the randomness that made her a ""wheelchair girl"" has also liberated her. 3) Nicole is angry like the Piper and lies to put an end to the possibility of a successful lawsuit. Her lie both implicates and liberates Dolores who otherwise would have continued to live in the town, believing that her neighbors did not hold her responsible for the accident while subjecting herself to the daily reminders of her absent children. Her new job and life in another town is a constructive change and the film's final substitution.Then again, what do I know?

30490,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,078062162X,Patrick L. Randall,"[0, 19]","Perhaps I am a bad person for not being moved by ""The Sweet Hereafter"".  The overwhelming majority of Amazon.com reviewers would seem to indicate this.  The unanimous acclaim heaped upon it by respected film critics would also seem to support that theory.  However, I must stand by my initial reactions to seeing this movie, which have not lessened in the time since.  On some levels, ""The Sweet Hereafter"" just fails to generate any true emotion and empathy for the characters involved in coping with the horrible tragedy of the death of 14 young children in school bus accident.  On other levels, it generates the wrong kinds of emotions when watching how these characters cope with the tragedy while also revealing the dark secrets they held prior to this life-changing event.The story centers on a lawyer (played by Ian Holm) who has journeyed to this small town to capitalize on the grief of the bereaved parents by involving them in a class-action lawsuit against a villain that seems not to exist.  This terrible accident was just that, an accident.  ""The Sweet Hereafter"" follows the lawyer as he coerces the parents to go along with this lawsuit while intercutting scenes dealing with the lawyer's own personal failures as a father and scenes dealing with the clandestine lives of the townspeople.  This would seem to have the makings of a truly powerful film.  Certainly, such respected film critics as Roger Ebert and James Berardinelli see it as such.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't pan out that way for me.  Holm's lawyer seems too cold and distant to truly understand the plight of the townspeople or even that of his own daughter.  I suppose that's the point, but in order to connect with the movie, one needs to connect with him, as he is the central protagonist.  It just doesn't happen here.However, the more I think about this movie, though, the more I believe my disconnect may not be caused by Holm's performance, but rather by the revulsion I felt for inappropriate handling of some truly horrific behaviors.  The first, most obvious, of these is the incest between a young girl named Nicole (who is also central to the story) and here father.  It's hinted at early and then shown as a revolting display of intimacy, complete with candles and romantic setting.  It's set up like a love scene from most romantic movies, not as some dirty, immoral, horrible act by a depraved parent against an unwitting child.  To treat it is as such distracts the viewer from the message that the movie is trying to make.  Then, to barely even tangentially reference this act again can only serve to anger the viewer even more.  There was no reason for this subplot to be in this movie.  It angers me to no end how poorly it was used since they did decide to have it in the movie.  Another area of inappropriateness, which is never touched on at all, is how a set of 'hippie' parents raised there adopted son, Bear, who was one of the children lost in the accident.  Attention to details around their house, which can be seen when the lawyer visits them, reveals some inappropriate photo portraits of their son.  This, coupled with an earlier scene where Bear is being sent off to school with an art project that looks like it was inspired by Robert Mapplethorpe, makes one wonder what kind of dark secrets may lurk in that family's past.  Of course, aside from a painful visit by the lawyer, these characters are never dealt with again.The situation with Bear has seemed to go largely unnoticed by critics and customers alike, but the atrocious predicament of Nicole's life has been cited by many as one of the truly gripping aspects of this film.  She supposedly transitions from a sweet and innocent child before the accident (incest aside) to a bitter and vindictive person afterwards (as she lost use of her legs as a result).  As I watched, I noticed very little difference between the before and after emotions of Nicole.  She was little more withdrawn, which is understandable, but there is none of this gripping emotion in her that other critics seem to have seen.

Atom Egoyan translates it into film in his own style, which is deep, dreamy, filled with symbolism.  He enjoys giving us an ambiguous and confusing sense of time. (His word is ""floaty."")  The only reason I did not give this fine film  five stars is that, for my taste, it's a bit too self-consciously ""poetic."" I found the addition of the Pied Piper a little too cutesy/creepy, but, again, it did suit the mood that he was wanting to create.Likewise, the face of the female lead, Sarah Polly--again, I found her pallor and lack of expression to be abstract to the point of being annoying.  However, again, it suited the vision of the director. I would have liked to see her perk up, after her breakthrough scene at the end....some sort of change in her face seemed definitely in order--maybe a glint of light in her eye, some color in her skin or a new set to her jaw.  What we saw was more of the same, lackluster mask like girl, driving back with her predator father.Their relationship is central to the story and I think it should have been handled less vaporously.  When I first saw them together at the County Fair, I thought the man was her somewhat-older boyfriend.  I missed it when she called him ""daddy"" later in the scene.  Egoyan comments that he wanted that ambiguity but I wonder why.  A little ambiguity goes a long way in my book.What I did like was the originality, the intelligence, of the story and for that we have the novelist to thank.  Thanks are also in order for the great cast, especially Ian Holm, who did a superb job in portraying the character of the big city lawyer, part hustler, part anguished, loving father.It's the vitality of the other characters that grounds the film in some sort of reality, especially the feisty Billy who, although grieving for his wife, certainly has a healthy appreciation for the living ladies, including the pale baby sitter.Also the film is visually appealing, set in the Canadian Rockies in their snowy splendor. The details of the homes are nice, too, and give you something to entertain your eyes while the subject matter sinks into deep cold waters.As dark as the film is in mood and subject matter, there is a transcendent quality to it as the central characters make choices that move them forward in their lives.  This gives a satisfying conclusion that is still suitably subtle.I think that whether a person will enjoy this film or not depends on his personal taste.  Obviously many who wrote here love it enormously; others might have a hard time with the abundance of ""mood.""",4,Poetic rendering of a very good story,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,2642,"['story', 'great', 'thanks', 'doubt', 'novel', 'Russell', 'Banks', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'film', 'own', 'style', 'deep', 'dreamy', 'filled', 'symbolism', 'giving', 'ambiguous', 'confusing', 'sense', 'time', 'word', 'floaty', 'only', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'fine', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'taste', 'bit', 'too', 'self-consciously', 'poetic', 'found', 'addition', 'Pied', 'Piper', 'little', 'too', 'cutesy/creepy', 'again', 'did', 'suit', 'mood', 'was', 'wanting', 'create.Likewise', 'face', 'female', 'lead', 'Sarah', 'Polly', 'again', 'found', 'pallor', 'lack', 'expression', 'be', 'abstract', 'point', 'being', 'annoying', 'However', 'again', 'suited', 'vision', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'perk', 'up', 'breakthrough', 'scene', 'end', '.some', 'sort', 'change', 'face', 'seemed', 'definitely', 'order', 'maybe', 'glint', 'light', 'eye', 'color', 'skin', 'new', 'set', 'jaw', 'What', 'saw', 'was', 'more', 'same', 'lackluster', 'mask', 'girl', 'driving', 'back', 'predator', 'father.Their', 'relationship', 'central', 'story', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'less', 'vaporously', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'together', 'County', 'Fair', 'thought', 'man', 'was', 'somewhat-older', 'boyfriend', 'missed', 'when', 'called', 'daddy', 'later', 'scene', 'Egoyan', 'comments', 'wanted', 'ambiguity', 'wonder', 'why', 'little', 'ambiguity', 'long', 'way', 'book.What', 'did', 'like', 'was', 'originality', 'intelligence', 'story', 'have', 'novelist', 'thank', 'Thanks', 'are', 'also', 'order', 'great', 'cast', 'especially', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'who', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'portraying', 'character', 'big', 'city', 'lawyer', 'part', 'hustler', 'part', 'anguished', 'loving', 'father.It', 'vitality', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'sort', 'reality', 'especially', 'feisty', 'Billy', 'who', 'grieving', 'wife', 'certainly', 'healthy', 'appreciation', 'living', 'ladies', 'including', 'pale', 'baby', 'sitter.Also', 'film', 'visually', 'appealing', 'set', 'Canadian', 'Rockies', 'snowy', 'splendor', 'details', 'homes', 'are', 'nice', 'too', 'give', 'something', 'entertain', 'eyes', 'subject', 'matter', 'sinks', 'deep', 'cold', 'waters.As', 'dark', 'film', 'mood', 'subject', 'matter', 'transcendent', 'quality', 'central', 'characters', 'make', 'choices', 'move', 'forward', 'lives', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'still', 'suitably', 'subtle.I', 'think', 'person', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'not', 'personal', 'taste', 'Obviously', 'many', 'who', 'wrote', 'here', 'love', 'enormously', 'others', 'might', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'abundance', 'mood']",N/A

I was a bit disappointed that the film tended to only use two narratives, which tended to give the story and characters less depth.  One other thing that disturbed me is how the incestual relationship between Nicole and her father is portrayed in an immensely different way than in the novel.  In the novel, the description of the relationship fuels Nicole's anger towards her dad, while the movie's portrayal of the anger never seems to be explained sufficiently.To judge the movie as a movie and not as an adaptation, it is an excellent piece of work.

This film not only covers that aspect of grief, but also a grief for the living ones who sometimes we loose even as they are alive.  Director Atom Egoyan tells this story as a puzzle that shifts from past to present and watching the film takes a lot of concentration because every little piece of the story matters to the movie's ending.  The story is about the school bus accident in which many children die and the entire town is emotionally affected.  Parents are overwhelmed with grief and so are the friends of the young ones who used to be their babysitters and caretakers.  As class action lawsuit attorney is making his way throught the city, he is recruiting parents of the dead children for the pending lawsuit.  It this primarily blue collar town, everyone knows everyone's business, but there are also a few secrets that unveil themselves to the astonishment of the viewer and discretion of the secrets' protagonists.I found movie powerful and moving in describing human emotion that often is so difficult to describe.  We see grief in all its forms: denial, regret, anger, sorrow.  The emotion is so powerful that one cannot be indifferenttowards it.  And as film explores on how do we deal with grief and move with our life afterwards, there are so many ways that different characters approach this issue.

A lawyer, Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm), fighting his own child-related woes, goes to the townspeople in the aftermath of the accident to whip up a case against someone&#8212;the bus company, the department of works, anyone. He is excellent, as most lawyers are, at playing on the anger and outrage of the townspeople, and eventually all of them retain him except one. He is joined in his stand against the lawsuit by a rather odd ally, the only survivor of the crash itself, Nicole (Sarah Polley), who just wants the world to leave her, and her town, alone.There are a lot of good things about this movie. Holm, Polley, and Egoyan vet Tom McCamus (looking his Brad Dourif-est as Polley's father) are all excellent actors, and a number of scenes in the film unfold with a kind of quiet joy that makes absolutely no sense in the general scheme of the tragedy, but at the same time make all the sense in the world. For all that, though, the movie never really coheres in the way it should; the lawyer's daughter is too obvious just a mechanism for his rage, the story's timelines get a bit muddled now and again, etc., but the flaws are minor compared to the strengths. I'd disagree with the vox pop at IMDB, who have placed The Sweet Hereafter in the top 250, but it's certainly not a bad little film.

Holm's character, Stephens, is intriguing and viewers are left to wonder if he was drawn to this case out of greed or to quell his own internal demons.The movie is haunting.

Egoyan incorporates the music of the Tragically Hip (performed both by them, and hauntingly by the film's star Sarah Polley), barren winter imagery, deeply layered characters, and a non-linear story line all to great effect. Probably the most effective scenes in the movie are the times when the landscape is still and the characters just sit. There is the haunting feedback of a discarded guitar, the silent play between Ian Holm and Sarah Polley in their few scenes together, the moment in which the doomed school bus at the story's center hovers tenuously on the ice...Everything has the effect of passing the viewer into a world at once bleak and hopeful, beautiful and disturbing. The ideas behind the film go deeper than just grief and loss, often so deep that they cannot be fully articulated even far down in the viewers soul. It just sits there like a weight on the heart for weeks after viewing and never lets the viewer escape its haunting grip. Sarah Polley and Ian Holm give standout performances, Atom Egoyan confirms the genious sugested at in &quot;Exotica,&quot; and the score is a must-have for any music fan.

30502,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,078062162X,Shashank Tripathi,"[10, 10]","The simple, smooth lives of a small Canadian town nestled in snow-capped peaks of British Columbia are jarred by a schoolbus accident that takes the lives of some kids and brutally hurts others.The film intimately tiptoes into the homes of affected parents, each with their own perspective and mien, but connected by a lawyer from out of town bent upon instigating them to dig deeper into the tragedy's cause and sue those responsible.But what makes this caper special is how deeply we relate to each character in the film. The lawyer for instance (played impeccably by Holm) may come across as a swindling ambulance-chaser at first, but as much as we feel ready to dismiss his callous opportunism we can't because we are privy to his own personal anguish -- it's almost as if his keenness to help the town were driven by his search for an outlet for his own pent-up emotions. There is a lingering subplot about incest in one family, which in  hindsight is pivotal to the film, but there's never a condescending tone about it.In fact, The Sweet Hereafter impetuosly blackballs the idea of revenge or malice in coming to terms with a loss of this nature and scope. Instead it sanely depicts a community caring for itself through mutual healing. Even a lie told delicately and with the right timing can be a much-needed suture on a gaping wound. It's stirring to see how this plays out.If you've seen Exotica, you are familiar with Egoyan's lyrical screenplays. The narrative here is a brilliant riff on the tale of the Pied Piper; it comes on in voiceover at just the right points but manages to signify something different each time. Danna's exotic score lends a sombre yet serene texture to the anxious proceedings. The landscape is repeatedly expressed as a richly sweeping expanse of snowy ground spread beneath low clouds. Naked emotion weighs in on every frame, a welcome change from Hollywoodesque kitsch.In a nutshell, the film has virtually every attribute that an intelligent moviegoer looks for in a film.

30504,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,078062162X,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[7, 15]","Atom Egoyan's ""The Sweet Hereafter,"" is a film I wish I could like more.  I had heard so many wonderful things about the film that I eagerly awaited my opportunity to view it for myself.  Strangely enough, my local video store never bothered to stock it which looking back now might have been an omen of things to come.  I finally did track down a copy to rent in due time and, I'm sad to report, was left with a sense of disappointment when the film ended.""The Sweet Hereafter"" opens with twin tragedies.  In a small Canadian town, a school bus accident has occurred which has left 14 children dead.  Miles away, a lawyer who would become involved in the bus accident receives a phone call from his estranged daughter.  She tells him she is dying.  The lawyer's name is Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm) and he tracks down the parents who lost children in the accident hoping to file a class action lawsuit against the bus company.  Stephens is driven to represent the townspeople partly because that is what he does in life and partly to distract him from the situation with his daughter.  The town becomes divided over whether to pursue the lawsuit.  Eventually, everything comes down to the testimony of one of the accident's survivors.  Her name is Nicole (Sarah Polley) and what she says ensures that there will be no winners.Egoyan's film is as much a commentary on survivor's guilt as it is about the dark secrets a town can hold even though everything appears proper on the outside.  It is a film about heartbreak and facades and how life can be so unfair.  Yet, the film feels distant.  While the various story arcs are well-defined and acted, I found it difficult to become immersed in the world I was watching.  The film felt too muted and devoid of an emotional spark.  While the hardships experienced by the characters in the film made for emotional drama, the film itself was less successful in generating strong emotional responses.  The only instance where a truly-wrenching feeling swelled up in me was toward the end when the driver of the ill-fated bus is painfully reminded of the accident through a chance encounter.It may be that an Atom Egoyan film is an acquired taste that I unfortunately have not developed.  Yet, I will give credit where credit is due by saying that Ian Holm and Sarah Polley should have received more recognition for their star turns.  Watching Polly in particular makes one wonder why she is not currently being offered more high-profile work.  Her performance here and in Doug Liman's ""Go"" (1999) have been flawless.  Here's hoping that Hollywood will see fit to make more productive use of her talents.",2,"""You leave the people of this town alone!""",1045958400,"02 23, 2003",2003,2646,"['Atom', 'Egoyan', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'film', 'wish', 'could', 'like', 'more', 'had', 'heard', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'things', 'film', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'opportunity', 'view', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'never', 'bothered', 'stock', 'looking', 'back', 'now', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'omen', 'things', 'come', 'finally', 'did', 'track', 'down', 'copy', 'rent', 'due', 'time', ""'m"", 'sad', 'report', 'was', 'left', 'sense', 'disappointment', 'when', 'film', 'ended', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'twin', 'tragedies', 'small', 'Canadian', 'town', 'school', 'bus', 'accident', 'occurred', 'left', '14', 'children', 'dead', 'Miles', 'away', 'lawyer', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'involved', 'bus', 'accident', 'phone', 'call', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'dying', 'lawyer', 'name', 'Mitchell', 'Stephens', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'down', 'parents', 'who', 'lost', 'children', 'accident', 'hoping', 'file', 'class', 'action', 'lawsuit', 'bus', 'company', 'Stephens', 'driven', 'represent', 'townspeople', 'partly', 'what', 'life', 'partly', 'distract', 'situation', 'daughter', 'town', 'divided', 'pursue', 'lawsuit', 'Eventually', 'everything', 'down', 'testimony', 'one', 'accident', 'survivors', 'name', 'Nicole', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'winners.Egoyan', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'commentary', 'survivor', 'guilt', 'dark', 'secrets', 'town', 'can', 'hold', 'even', 'everything', 'proper', 'outside', 'film', 'heartbreak', 'facades', 'how', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'unfair', 'film', 'feels', 'distant', 'various', 'story', 'arcs', 'are', 'well-defined', 'acted', 'found', 'difficult', 'become', 'immersed', 'world', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'felt', 'too', 'muted', 'devoid', 'emotional', 'spark', 'hardships', 'experienced', 'characters', 'film', 'made', 'emotional', 'drama', 'film', 'was', 'less', 'successful', 'generating', 'strong', 'emotional', 'responses', 'only', 'instance', 'where', 'truly-wrenching', 'feeling', 'swelled', 'up', 'was', 'end', 'when', 'driver', 'ill-fated', 'bus', 'painfully', 'reminded', 'accident', 'chance', 'encounter.It', 'may', 'be', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'film', 'acquired', 'taste', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'not', 'developed', 'will', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'saying', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'more', 'recognition', 'star', 'Watching', 'Polly', 'particular', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'not', 'currently', 'being', 'offered', 'more', 'high-profile', 'work', 'performance', 'here', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'Go', '1999', 'have', 'been', 'flawless', 'Here', 'hoping', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'see', 'fit', 'make', 'more', 'productive', 'use', 'talents']",N/A

Maybe a 4 3/5 stars film--way up there, but not finally on the par with the perfect 5's. With all it's snow and similar music and bittersweet pace and subtle ironies, I couldn't help comparing it to ""Fargo"" as I watched it, but whereas ""Fargo"" (one of the perfect 5's) rode along on elements of comedy and absurdity along with all the horrors, ""Sweet Hereafter"" has nothing comic about it, but is able to tell a serious story of pain while craftily avoiding the pathetic.  Egoyan uses many cinematic devices which are very similar to the Coen brothers, and like them, exudes a remarkable confidence while traversing other unfamiliar cinematic territories. At times, this movie also has the flavor of ""Twin Peaks""--a small town, some of whose members have despairing sexual secrets, wracked by sudden tragedy, but again, this movie remains straight, without ""Twin Peak's"" droll gloss, but rather, with only hard, open-eyed viewing.  The performances are brilliant.  It's hard to take your eyes off Ian Holm. His purposes and his dilemmas are rivetting. I find it interesting how so many reviewers, including the professional reviewers, so quickly and off-handedly condemn his character as a parasite. I didn't see him that way at all. That's a sadly simplistic interpretation of a very complex character, and an all-too readily available stereotype, and a condescendantly flippant dismissal of a whole profession. These reviewers aren't paying attention. This character deserves much more respect and Ian Holm does a wonderful job of filling him out and pasting his conflicts for all to see.  The same can be said for Sarah Polley and her character. She is a delight to watch. Between the dialogue, in the most subtle non-verbal expressions she is able to externalize her character's internal rip tides with devastating effect. It's some amazing self-contained acting. Then, not to forget all the other actors and everyone else involved in this film's production, it has to be said that all the elements in this film, technical and artistic and professional, are superb.But all in all, I was not completely satisfied. Being the father of a much beloved daughter, I held on to the end awaiting some kind of epiphany about the parent-child relationship--something to eternally digest this film with--and felt like the film was right there ready to offer it up, but somehow it slipped away, and I never got that ""something""--intellectual, emotional, or both--which could be ultimately solid enough to come away with and stand on and use to say that this is a great amongst greats, but it is definitely very very very very very extremely good.",5,One minor major detail...,1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,2721,"['want', 'say', 'great', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'perfectly', 'great', 'Maybe', '4', '3/5', 'stars', 'film', 'way', 'there', 'not', 'finally', 'par', 'perfect', '5', 'snow', 'similar', 'music', 'bittersweet', 'pace', 'subtle', 'ironies', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'comparing', 'Fargo', 'watched', 'Fargo', 'one', 'perfect', '5', 'rode', 'elements', 'comedy', 'absurdity', 'horrors', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'nothing', 'comic', 'able', 'tell', 'serious', 'story', 'pain', 'craftily', 'avoiding', 'pathetic', 'Egoyan', 'many', 'cinematic', 'devices', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'remarkable', 'confidence', 'traversing', 'other', 'unfamiliar', 'cinematic', 'territories', 'times', 'movie', 'also', 'flavor', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'small', 'town', 'members', 'have', 'despairing', 'sexual', 'secrets', 'wracked', 'sudden', 'tragedy', 'again', 'movie', 'straight', 'Twin', 'Peak', 'droll', 'gloss', 'rather', 'only', 'hard', 'open-eyed', 'viewing', 'performances', 'are', 'brilliant', 'hard', 'take', 'eyes', 'off', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'purposes', 'dilemmas', 'are', 'rivetting', 'find', 'interesting', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'including', 'professional', 'reviewers', 'so', 'quickly', 'off-handedly', 'condemn', 'character', 'parasite', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'way', 'sadly', 'simplistic', 'interpretation', 'very', 'complex', 'character', 'all-too', 'readily', 'available', 'stereotype', 'condescendantly', 'flippant', 'dismissal', 'whole', 'profession', 'reviewers', 'are', ""n't"", 'paying', 'attention', 'character', 'much', 'more', 'respect', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'wonderful', 'job', 'filling', 'pasting', 'conflicts', 'see', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'character', 'delight', 'watch', 'dialogue', 'most', 'subtle', 'non-verbal', 'expressions', 'able', 'externalize', 'character', 'internal', 'rip', 'tides', 'devastating', 'effect', 'amazing', 'self-contained', 'acting', 'Then', 'not', 'forget', 'other', 'actors', 'everyone', 'else', 'involved', 'film', 'production', 'be', 'said', 'elements', 'film', 'technical', 'artistic', 'professional', 'are', 'superb.But', 'was', 'not', 'completely', 'satisfied', 'Being', 'father', 'much', 'beloved', 'daughter', 'held', 'end', 'awaiting', 'kind', 'epiphany', 'parent-child', 'relationship', 'something', 'eternally', 'digest', 'film', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'right', 'there', 'ready', 'offer', 'up', 'somehow', 'slipped', 'away', 'never', 'got', 'something', 'intellectual', 'emotional', 'could', 'be', 'ultimately', 'solid', 'enough', 'come', 'away', 'stand', 'use', 'say', 'great', 'amongst', 'greats', 'definitely', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'extremely', 'good']",N/A

Unconsciously the subject matter may have affected their judgments. Here was a film about a very delicate subject--the death of innocent children. The characters in the film (parents of the deceased children) were all shattered. It was as if criticizing the film was akin to criticizing these parents as well as any parent who had experienced such a tragic loss. But from the point of view of effective drama, the film is virtually a complete failure. Very little of it rings true at all.Except for some very nice cinematography and an affecting musical score, 'The Sweet Hereafter' plods along at a snail's pace. The director's intent is to display the range of emotions these parents felt in the aftermath of losing their children. But what is so profound about focusing on such grief? The main character, a negligence lawyer, goes around the town convincing the parents to join in a class action lawsuit against the unspecified person or situation which caused the terrible accident. Most of the parents he sees agree to join the lawsuit (a lot of these scenes with the parents are drawn out and could have been easily condensed). The lawyer finally encounters one man who gives him a hard time. This is perhaps the most dramatic conflict that comes up during the film. But this one towns person's opposition to joining the lawsuit is completely vague. Why is he so against joining the lawsuit? Why is so angry at the lawyer? Because he feels the lawyer is profiting at the expense of the townspeople? Even so, is it really believable that he doesn't want to get to the bottom of what happened as opposed to simply dropping the whole case?The ending of the film is even more unbelievable. The negligence lawyer never seems to have a definitive plan to try the case. He alludes to various factors that caused the accident, such as a faulty guard rail or a defective bolt inside the bus. A real negligence lawyer would never have taken such a huge case in the first place without feeling that he could be successful. It almost seems like he thinks that he uncover the 'truth' during the discovery process. A real lawyer would have already had some tangible evidence (already uncovered) that would have convinced him to go forward. Furthermore, when the young survivor lies in her deposition, stating that the bus driver was driving too fast, the seemingly smart lawyer folds up like a deck of cards and decides not to cross-examine her. A real lawyer could have made mince-meat of her but he chooses to quit the case and leave all his clients in the lurch. In real life he probably would have been hauled in front of an ethics board.And why does the young survivor decide to lie in the end? Why does she lie knowing that she is accusing the innocent bus driver? Why does she want to case to 'go away'? Is it that she's so traumatized by the accident that she simply wants to forget about it? Everything is left so open and vague in this film that we never understand any of the characters' motivations.Lastly, there's a lot of lame talk (mostly over the phone) between the lawyer and his drug-addicted, rebellious daughter. Seemingly there's supposed to be some kind of parallel between the lawyer's personal angst and the angst of the townspeople (this is the lawyer's defense when that one townspeople berates him before the climactic deposition scene). All this conflict between the lawyer and the daughter is gratuitous and simply does not work cinematically. We hardly ever see those two characters together and their conflict is basically a separate story which has no real place in this film.The Sweet Hereafter basically lacks substance. It congratulates itself for displaying the raw emotion of grief but lacks a central antagonist to engage us. An examination of grief in itself is not enough to sustain an entire story. Whenever conflicts do arise in this film, they are episodic, unclearly motivated and for the most part, lacking the ring of truth. If you're strictly into atmosphere and mood, this is the film for you. But if you're looking for a strong story arc with convincing conflicts, you will not find it in 'The Sweet Hereafter'.",2,The Sweet Hereafter of Bogus Film Criticism,1237507200,"03 20, 2009",2009,4424,"['Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'concerns', 'tragic', 'effect', 'school', 'bus', 'crash', 'townspeople', 'rural', 'town', 'Many', 'critics', 'were', 'afraid', 'judge', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'placed', 'pedestal', 'where', 'declared', 'film', 'limits', 'kind', 'real', 'criticism', 'Unconsciously', 'subject', 'matter', 'may', 'have', 'affected', 'judgments', 'Here', 'was', 'film', 'very', 'delicate', 'subject', 'death', 'innocent', 'children', 'characters', 'film', 'parents', 'deceased', 'children', 'were', 'shattered', 'was', 'criticizing', 'film', 'was', 'akin', 'criticizing', 'parents', 'as', 'well', 'parent', 'who', 'had', 'experienced', 'tragic', 'loss', 'point', 'view', 'effective', 'drama', 'film', 'virtually', 'complete', 'failure', 'Very', 'little', 'true', 'all.Except', 'very', 'nice', 'cinematography', 'affecting', 'musical', 'score', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'plods', 'snail', 'pace', 'director', 'intent', 'display', 'range', 'emotions', 'parents', 'felt', 'aftermath', 'losing', 'children', 'what', 'so', 'profound', 'focusing', 'such', 'grief', 'main', 'character', 'negligence', 'lawyer', 'town', 'convincing', 'parents', 'join', 'class', 'action', 'lawsuit', 'unspecified', 'person', 'situation', 'caused', 'terrible', 'accident', 'Most', 'parents', 'agree', 'join', 'lawsuit', 'lot', 'scenes', 'parents', 'are', 'drawn', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'condensed', 'lawyer', 'finally', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'hard', 'time', 'perhaps', 'most', 'dramatic', 'conflict', 'up', 'film', 'one', 'person', 'opposition', 'joining', 'lawsuit', 'completely', 'vague', 'Why', 'so', 'joining', 'lawsuit', 'Why', 'so', 'angry', 'lawyer', 'lawyer', 'profiting', 'expense', 'townspeople', 'Even', 'so', 'really', 'believable', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'bottom', 'what', 'happened', 'opposed', 'simply', 'dropping', 'whole', 'case', 'ending', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'negligence', 'lawyer', 'never', 'have', 'definitive', 'plan', 'try', 'case', 'various', 'factors', 'caused', 'accident', 'such', 'faulty', 'guard', 'rail', 'defective', 'bolt', 'bus', 'real', 'negligence', 'lawyer', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'taken', 'huge', 'case', 'first', 'place', 'feeling', 'could', 'be', 'successful', 'almost', ""'truth"", 'discovery', 'process', 'real', 'lawyer', 'would', 'have', 'already', 'had', 'tangible', 'evidence', 'already', 'uncovered', 'would', 'have', 'convinced', 'go', 'forward', 'Furthermore', 'when', 'young', 'survivor', 'deposition', 'stating', 'bus', 'driver', 'was', 'driving', 'too', 'fast', 'seemingly', 'smart', 'lawyer', 'up', 'deck', 'cards', 'not', 'cross-examine', 'real', 'lawyer', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'mince-meat', 'quit', 'case', 'leave', 'clients', 'lurch', 'real', 'life', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hauled', 'front', 'ethics', 'board.And', 'why', 'young', 'survivor', 'decide', 'lie', 'end', 'Why', 'lie', 'knowing', 'accusing', 'innocent', 'bus', 'driver', 'Why', 'want', 'case', ""'go"", 'away', 'so', 'traumatized', 'accident', 'simply', 'forget', 'Everything', 'left', 'so', 'open', 'vague', 'film', 'never', 'understand', 'characters', 'motivations.Lastly', 'lot', 'lame', 'talk', 'mostly', 'phone', 'lawyer', 'drug-addicted', 'rebellious', 'daughter', 'Seemingly', 'supposed', 'be', 'kind', 'parallel', 'lawyer', 'personal', 'angst', 'angst', 'townspeople', 'lawyer', 'defense', 'when', 'one', 'townspeople', 'climactic', 'deposition', 'scene', 'conflict', 'lawyer', 'daughter', 'gratuitous', 'simply', 'not', 'work', 'cinematically', 'hardly', 'ever', 'see', 'two', 'characters', 'together', 'conflict', 'basically', 'separate', 'story', 'real', 'place', 'film.The', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'basically', 'substance', 'displaying', 'raw', 'emotion', 'grief', 'central', 'antagonist', 'engage', 'examination', 'grief', 'not', 'enough', 'sustain', 'entire', 'story', 'Whenever', 'conflicts', 'do', 'arise', 'film', 'are', 'episodic', 'unclearly', 'motivated', 'most', 'part', 'lacking', 'ring', 'truth', ""'re"", 'strictly', 'atmosphere', 'mood', 'film', ""'re"", 'looking', 'strong', 'story', 'arc', 'convincing', 'conflicts', 'will', 'not', 'find', ""'The"", 'Sweet', 'Hereafter']",N/A

But that benighted Canadian town, which seems to have a cloud  permanently ansconced above it, is made so palpably and painfully real,  that you feel as if you spent a week there one night.  Everyone is wounded  by the deaths of those school children.  No one is spared, not even the  ambulance-chasing lawyer who becomes an unwitting dupe for the girl who  survives the accident, but who alone finds she must lie in order to bring  an end to the painful proceedings.  Her relationship with her father is all  the more bizarre because it is presented so matter-of-factly.  But Ian  Holm's own torment, from a drug-addicted daughter who is always calling him  from the fringes of her self-made hell, is a brilliant counterpoint to the  litany of loss that Egoyan enacts.  I thought the references to The Pied  Piper of Hamelin were a tad repetetive, but it's a tiny flaw in an  overpowering film.",4,Iam Holm's Triumph,967248000,"08 26, 2000",2000,978,"['was', 'complete', 'surprise', ""'ve"", 'never', 'much', 'cared', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'benighted', 'Canadian', 'town', 'have', 'cloud', 'permanently', 'ansconced', 'made', 'so', 'palpably', 'painfully', 'real', 'feel', 'spent', 'week', 'there', 'one', 'night', 'Everyone', 'wounded', 'deaths', 'school', 'children', 'one', 'spared', 'not', 'even', 'ambulance-chasing', 'lawyer', 'who', 'unwitting', 'dupe', 'girl', 'who', 'accident', 'who', 'alone', 'must', 'lie', 'order', 'bring', 'end', 'painful', 'proceedings', 'relationship', 'father', 'more', 'bizarre', 'presented', 'so', 'matter-of-factly', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'own', 'torment', 'drug-addicted', 'daughter', 'who', 'always', 'calling', 'fringes', 'self-made', 'hell', 'brilliant', 'counterpoint', 'litany', 'loss', 'Egoyan', 'thought', 'references', 'Pied', 'Piper', 'Hamelin', 'were', 'tad', 'repetetive', 'tiny', 'flaw', 'overpowering', 'film']",N/A
