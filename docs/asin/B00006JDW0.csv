What kinds of World Heavyweight champions and undefeated prison champions don't know how to play defense?  Now granted a real boxing fight between two greats may be a bit long and boring or last all of 30 seconds.  I just didn't think the fight was all that great.As for the movie, great story idea, but seemed like there should have been more to it.  I believe Snipes' character was meant to look like the silent bad-a$$ loner, but he came across as a weirdo.  I found myself cheering for the &quot;Iceman&quot; from the get go.  Plus, I'm pretty sure that if he weren't a paper champion (which he wasn't portrayed as) he would have produced a shellacking on Monroe inside of the first couple of minutes.  I actually liked the film for a testosterone-filled action flic, but the ending just didn't grab me and make me cheer for the tooth-pick architect.I recommend this as a rental maybe once, but it's definitley not a classic.",3,A bit disappointing.,1041206400,"12 30, 2002",2002,1035,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'movies', 'critics', 'have', 'watched', 'final', 'fight', 'scene', 'was', 'left', 'wanting', 'What', 'World', 'Heavyweight', 'champions', 'undefeated', 'prison', 'champions', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'play', 'defense', 'Now', 'real', 'boxing', 'fight', 'two', 'greats', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'long', 'boring', 'last', '30', 'seconds', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'fight', 'was', 'great.As', 'movie', 'great', 'story', 'idea', 'seemed', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'believe', 'Snipes', 'character', 'was', 'meant', 'look', 'silent', 'bad-a', 'loner', 'came', 'across', 'weirdo', 'found', 'cheering', 'quot', 'Iceman', 'quot', 'get', 'go', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'were', ""n't"", 'paper', 'champion', 'was', ""n't"", 'portrayed', 'would', 'have', 'produced', 'shellacking', 'Monroe', 'first', 'couple', 'minutes', 'actually', 'liked', 'film', 'testosterone-filled', 'action', 'flic', 'ending', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'grab', 'make', 'cheer', 'tooth-pick', 'architect.I', 'recommend', 'rental', 'maybe', 'once', 'definitley', 'not', 'classic']",Undisputed
718355,A1MIJKZQ1MIRBM,B00006JDW0,C. Law,"[0, 2]","Wesley Snipes stars as the boxing champ of Sweetwater Prison whose title and manhood are put at jeopardy when the true heavyweight champion (played by Ving Rhames) lands in the cellblock for the rape of a showgirl (Rose Rollins).I enjoyed UNDISPUTED for the first thirty minutes or so but after that I became lost. I was looking for deeper character development than I ever got. We get to know Ving Rhames character the most (mainly because he's a replica of Mike Tyson) and he's the antagonist. We get introduced to several supporting characters (Wes Studi, Fisher Stevens, Peter Falk, Michael Rooker, Jon Seda) here and there for whatever reason. However, they're all a prison clich&eacute;.The character we never get to know, oddly, is the hero, played by Wesley Snipes. We can only assume that Snipes is the hero because of his sensitive hobby of making houses out of toothpicks. Other than that, Snipes has only about twenty lines. It's weird. Rhames even though billed second has far more screen time than Snipes.I can't help but feel that this film lost it in the editing room. Somehow this movie feels like half a movie. Like important parts have been chopped away. I just can't imagine writers Walter Hill and David Giler (ALIEN), or any writers for that matter, writing a script with such a non-dimensional lead character.While action film veteran Walter Hill (48 HOURS; LAST MAN STANDING) has learned some stylish new tricks to filmmaking, they're not enough to save his latest effort.

It looked like a potential action blockbuster with two pretty decent actors in Wesley and Ving playing opposite each other.  I really, really wanted to like it.Guess I can't get everything I want.Ving is the World Champion boxer imprisoned for raping a woman.  In the prison we find that there is an underground boxing world run by the guards and an old mobster.  The champion in this world is Wesley.  Naturally the movie builds to the final conflict between the two.The movie was, at best, bad.  I kept watching hoping to see something emerge from this mess and it didn't.  The plot, or what little there was, was pure cliche and a bad one at that.  Neither actor really invested anything in the characters, both of which were also pure cliche.

718362,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00006JDW0,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","So, no, this isn't Jane Austen's UNDISPUTED. This is Walter Hill at the helm and he brings his own brand of taut urban grit to the film. UNDISPUTED is a prison drama, a boxing movie, and a character study. It's peopled by hardened characters you probably won't want to hang out with, except in the confines of cinema.It's exciting times at the Sweetwater correctional facility, up in the Mojave Desert, and specifically for the California State Inter-Prison Boxing Program. George ""Iceman"" Chambers (Rhames), the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world, just pulled a Mike Tyson and now comes to Sweetwater to serve out his sentence. The Iceman, new rooster in the crib, promptly learns that the prison system already boasts its own undisputed champeen, Monroe Hutchen (Snipes), a onetime ring prospect sentenced to life ten years ago, and without parole. Hutchen's boxing record also renders him undefeated. This doesn't sit too well with the Iceman, and dude is quick to challenge Hutchen for his place in the pecking order. Stoking the situation is a shambling old mobster, a bigtime boxing fan, who schemes to pit these two hard dudes against each other. And there's your movie.Iceman wasn't that far wrong when he said that ""People love a guy who can fight."" I'm a diehard boxing fan, so UNDISPUTED caught my attention when it came out. UNDISPUTED is lean and economical; it doesn't waste time getting down to business. And I appreciate it not only for its intense character play but also for its occasional referencing of old school pugilists (Joe Louis, Jack Dempsey, Rocky Marciano, etc.). Walter Hill, director of some of my favorite action films (The Warriors (The Ultimate Director's Cut),48 Hours,Streets of Fire,Trespass), has a knack for drawing out the brawny fan joy in a guy. In UNDISPUTED, he gradually builds things up for the inevitable fighty fight. More of a drama, not a lot of sustained action, other than Iceman and Hutchen's respective matches at the start of the film (to establish their fighting creds) and then the big crunching bout at the end. In between is plenty of prison politics and mind games, posturing and quick bursts of aggresiveness, mostly perpetrated by the Iceman, all of which scenes are quite fascinating.Wesley Snipes gets top billing but has the less showy role. Even though the introspective, solitary Monroe Hutchen is the prohibitive protagonist, he doesn't come across as the classic hero type. Recalling that Monroe Hutchen was convicted of murder, I guess we eye him as the protagonist mainly because he exudes a calm, nonaggresive demeanor and because he's seen as the underdog (the Iceman outweighs him by a bunch). Ving Rhames, early on tapped as the volatile big bad, actually gets more screen time than Snipes. I like that the Iceman isn't the typical dumb heavy; he demonstrates a certain cunning, as he negotiates with or unleashes violence on the Sweetwater denizens. The Iceman realizes that his fellow inmates continually look to test him. That he's so willing to start shiznit isn't as indicative of his innate brutality as much as it is a course of action he feels he has to take to survive in penitentiary. Rhames' two encounters with Snipes (the cafeteria and shower scenes) before the bout are memorable and fraught with tension.So, yeah, a menacing Ving Rhames and a resolute Wesley Snipes drive the film. But there's a peppering of interesting supporting characters, with Fisher Stevens, Michael Rooker, and Jon Seda all getting chewy bit parts. But none of those are more colorful than Mendy Ripstein, that aged gangster convicted of tax evasion, played with wicked elan by Peter Falk. Allow me to inject my favorite quote from Falk's character: ""#@%$!!"" I've never seen the elderly cuss so much as Peter Falk. He drops so many F-bombs in one scene that I couldn't help crumbling with laughter. Not that I rub elbows with mobsters, but I thought Falk was quite convincing as an old wiseguy with clout. When the warden threatens to derail the upcoming bout, Ripstein tells his peeps: ""You know the drill. You help him... or you hurt him"" That's a cool line.*** SPOILER in this paragraph *** If I remember my boxing urban legend correctly, rumor was that, years ago, the retired Sugar Ray Leonard was contemplating a comeback but first wanted to test himself. He fought a closed doors match with someone and got his whatsis soundly beaten. Naturally, Sugar Ray denies this ever happening. UNDISPUTED shares something of that flavor. Snipes and Rhames put on a good tussle, both in tremendous shape and athletic enough to pull off the boxing thing. Snipes himself trained with renowned boxing trainer Emanuel Steward in prep for this role. And, while Snipes may be underweight in this bout, you have to be totally new to movies if you can't pick out the winner. At the end, the undisputed champion is the one still reigning in stir, while the other fella gets released from prison and regains his heavyweight crown. Except that, nowadays, he's also busy killing this rumor about how he got his whatsis handed to him, that one time behind bars.",4,"""People play baseball.

I kept expecting that the director would throw some kind of twist in there somewhere, but it never came.And there's another problem. You really don't feel for any of these characters. You couldn't care less what happens to any of them. Rhames' character steals the show, but never really gets the audience to hate him(a villain's job) because whether or not he committed a crime is questionable and his only other fault seems to be a big ego. Snipes'(supposedly the movie's hero) is seen even less than Rhames and even less sympathy is built for him because it is obvious that he did commit murder and all he ever does is sit around by himself in silence. This is what you call 0 character development. If the filmmakers were trying to build a Rocky-like charisma and audience appeal for the guy, they failed miserably.

718378,AYXC0BI77LVIT,B00006JDW0,Philipgstekel,"[1, 1]","Back in the 1940-1950s, boxing movies were a dime a dozen.  Often, they were done on a low budget or what they called back then ""B"" movies.There was a formula to boxing movies: it was corrupt and an innocent victim usually the boxer himself ending up either in jail or fighting to save his life at the expense of gangsters who fixed fights in order to make money.  Sometimes, the boxer would be caught in a love triangle between two women: A good girl who had his best interests at heart; and the bad girl who was beautiful, sultry and toyed with the fighters affections usually at the behest of the gangster.  In the end, a moral was taught and the fighter came out OK in the end.  In short, boxing was a metaphor for life:  someone who with will and determination triumphed over adversity and lived to see a better day.Fast forward now to 2002.  Times have changed and the formula has changed with it.  The boxing movie of today has to have edge, attitude but underlying the basic theme, the metaphor or life still applies.We have in Ving Rhames, somewhat of a Sonny Liston character toughened to the point that nothing affects him and he  won't be intimidated.  Success in the ring hasn't softened him one bit.On the other end, we have Wesley Snipes; a fighter of great promise only to have everything cut short because of murder.  Snipe's character too is toughened because of bitterness over what could have been and instead of riches and fame, he has to settle for being the ""baddest man in the prison system"".I'm not going to give away the whole scenario here but if you are a boxing fan and that includes collecting boxing movies, then this movie is a MUST.  It's well done and the production values are good and the fight scenes are realistic and believeable.Peter Falk who is the ""boxing historian"" of the prison sets the rules NOT using Marquis de Queensbury rules.

Here you see Wesley Snipes as 'Champ of the prison boxing' (for 10 years) Monroe Hutchen, and Ving Rhames as 'the real Champ' or George 'Iceman' Chambers, who is convicted for rape charge.  But some say they don't need two champs, so they decide it by fighting.So they fight, but not so soon.  A veteran prisoner named Ripstein (excellent Peter Falk, spitting out so many F-words) steps in, who truly loves the art of boxing, and he wants them to fight there, in the prison in the middle of the desert.  Surrounding the three main characters are Michael Rooker, Wes Studi, Jon Seda, Fisher Stevens, and Master P as special guest.The story is so simple, but the point is not that part.  If you are looking for &quot;48 Hours&quot; it's not here.  Hill and co-writer David Glier opted for creating realistic characters instead of actions, so what you see first is not the names of the actors, but those of the characters.  They do not talk much about themselves, unlike many films of the genre, but you get to know them through the dialogues, uttered by well-chosen actors who can really act.&quot;Undisputed&quot; belongs to the genre (prison film); however, it never shows unnecessary digression in the short course of story, and Hill wants that way (see how Michael Rooker's character slyly refers to the genre itself).  It is not about a hero and a villain, it's about men's pride and dignity, and on that score it succeeds.",4,"Prison, Boxing, and Men's Pride; Peter Falk Is Standout",1074384000,"01 18, 2004",2004,1580,"['quot', 'Undisputed', 'quot', 'Walter', 'Hill', 'film', 'well-drawn', 'characters', 'simple', 'premise', 'machismo', 'especially', 'last', 'thing', 'Here', 'see', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', ""'Champ"", 'prison', 'boxing', '10', 'years', 'Monroe', 'Hutchen', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'real', 'Champ', 'George', ""'Iceman"", 'Chambers', 'who', 'convicted', 'rape', 'charge', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'two', 'champs', 'decide', 'fighting.So', 'fight', 'not', 'so', 'soon', 'veteran', 'prisoner', 'named', 'Ripstein', 'excellent', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'spitting', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'F-words', 'steps', 'who', 'truly', 'art', 'boxing', 'fight', 'there', 'prison', 'middle', 'desert', 'Surrounding', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'Wes', 'Studi', 'Jon', 'Seda', 'Fisher', 'Stevens', 'Master', 'P', 'special', 'guest.The', 'story', 'so', 'simple', 'point', 'not', 'part', 'are', 'looking', 'quot', '48', 'Hours', 'quot', 'not', 'here', 'Hill', 'co-writer', 'David', 'Glier', 'opted', 'creating', 'realistic', 'characters', 'instead', 'actions', 'what', 'see', 'first', 'not', 'names', 'actors', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'talk', 'much', 'many', 'films', 'genre', 'get', 'know', 'dialogues', 'uttered', 'well-chosen', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'really', 'act.', 'quot', 'Undisputed', 'quot', 'genre', 'prison', 'film', 'however', 'never', 'unnecessary', 'digression', 'short', 'course', 'story', 'Hill', 'way', 'see', 'how', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'character', 'slyly', 'refers', 'genre', 'not', 'hero', 'villain', 'men', 'pride', 'dignity', 'score']",Undisputed
