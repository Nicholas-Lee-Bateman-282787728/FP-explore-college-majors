One day, the bullying goes too far and he endures his final beating. Now a new face is in town, ready to exact Michael's revenge. His name is Killjoy and he thinks murder is a laughing matter. In Killjoy 2, a group of at-risk youth are on their way to the wilderness for some much-need rehabilitation when their van breaks down and they find themselves in the home of a voodoo woman, Killjoy's spirit is summoned and we get more killer clown action. Killjoy 3 has a group of college students accidentally opening the portal to Killjoy's demon realm. Now trapped in Killjoy's strange funhouse world, they must team up to survive and end Killjoy's reign of terror once and for all.Despite what people have to say about this series, I actually enjoyed the heck out of it. This collection is a definite must-have for fans of Charles Band's features(Full Moon Pictures, Big City Pictures). I guess what I love most about the movies is Killjoy is never the same in every movie(unlike other horror movie icons). Even though he's played by two different actors(Angeles Vargas, Trent Haaga), you never quite know what to expect when watching the movies.",4,The Midnight Horror Collection: Killjoy Triple Feature......,1333584000,"04 5, 2012",2012,1260,"['Killjoy', 'story', 'Michael', 'reserved', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'outcast', 'peers', 'One', 'day', 'bullying', 'too', 'far', 'final', 'beating', 'Now', 'new', 'face', 'town', 'ready', 'exact', 'Michael', 'revenge', 'name', 'Killjoy', 'murder', 'laughing', 'matter', 'Killjoy', '2', 'group', 'at-risk', 'youth', 'are', 'way', 'wilderness', 'much-need', 'rehabilitation', 'when', 'van', 'breaks', 'down', 'find', 'home', 'voodoo', 'woman', 'Killjoy', 'spirit', 'summoned', 'get', 'more', 'killer', 'clown', 'action', 'Killjoy', '3', 'group', 'college', 'students', 'accidentally', 'opening', 'portal', 'Killjoy', 'demon', 'realm', 'Now', 'trapped', 'Killjoy', 'strange', 'funhouse', 'world', 'must', 'team', 'up', 'survive', 'end', 'Killjoy', 'reign', 'terror', 'once', 'all.Despite', 'what', 'people', 'have', 'say', 'series', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'heck', 'collection', 'definite', 'must-have', 'fans', 'Charles', 'Band', 'features', 'Full', 'Moon', 'Pictures', 'Big', 'City', 'Pictures', 'guess', 'what', 'love', 'most', 'movies', 'Killjoy', 'never', 'same', 'movie', 'other', 'horror', 'movie', 'icons', 'Even', 'played', 'two', 'different', 'actors', 'Angeles', 'Vargas', 'Trent', 'Haaga', 'never', 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'watching', 'movies']",Killjoy / Killjoy 2 / Killjoy 3
