1461315,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B005HVWVZE,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 2]","Jay Chou is a talented, chart-topping singer/musician from Taiwan.Known in America for his role as Kato in the 2011 film ""The Green Hornet"", most of Jay Chou's previous films were films that I guess many people can call them ""growth"" films.  A musician turned actor who grows with each film.  Beginning with his starring role in ""Initial D"", starring with two powerhouse talent in ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" with Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li but to create more ""growth"" films with ""Kung Fu Dunk"" (2008), followed by ""The Treasure Hunter"" (2009).And now, ""The Treasure Hunter"" receives its Blu-ray and DVD release in America courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment.VIDEO:""The Treasure Hunter"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  The picture quality is quite warm and sports plenty of detail during the daytime, cooler colors during the night time.  Detail is very well-done as we can see the detail around the treasure relics, to the detail of the cool special effects featured in the film.  Black levels are deep and overall, picture quality for the film is very good.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Treasure Hunter"" is presented in Dolby TrueHD 2.0 Mandarin and English.  I was surprised that this film was only a 2.0 mix but for the most part, the front channels definitely get a lot of work in showcasing the many sound effects during the intense action sequences of the film.  From windstorms, to shrieks by possessed characters and more!It's important to note that I did not listen to the English dub track as I prefer to watch Asian films in their original language.  With that being said, despite not liking English dialogue for Asian cinema, FUNimation Entertainment is well-known for their English dubs and doing a great work with them, so if you prefer English dubs instead of reading English subtitles, you do have that option.SPECIAL FEATURES""The Treasure Hunter"" comes with the following special feature:Original Trailer - (2:08) Original theatrical trailer for ""The Treasure Hunter"".EXTRAS:""The Treasure Hunter"" comes with a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:Another collaboration between Taiwan filmmaker Chu Yen-ping (""The King of Comics"", ""Kung Fu Dunk"") and music artist/actor Jay Chou plus popular Hong Kong action choreographer Ching Siu-tung (""A Chinese Ghost Story"" and ""Swordsman"" films), ""The Treasure Hunter"" was an interesting action film that tried to incorporate too much.First, as mentioned earlier, this is a ""growth"" film for Jay Chou.  As a singer, he wanted to improve his acting, so he did a few popcorn action films, one was ""Kung Fu Dunk"" and the other was this film ""The Treasure Hunter"".  Needless to say, these two films are not the best, and while they are both flashy in different ways, they are primarily popcorn action films with a popular singer as the main star.And while these two Chu Yen-ping films are good starting blocks for Jay Chou's acting and are literally stylish action films, while ""Kung Fu Dunk"" tried to capture the feel of ""Shaolin Soccer"" (which it failed to accomplish), ""The Treasure Hunter"" tries to be a martial arts Indiana Jones-style film with more plot holes than holes in Swiss cheese.One thing that we know of the film is that Jay Chou plays a treasure hunter that returns the treasure back to their owners.  We know there is sexual attraction between treasure hunter Qiao Fei and his mentor's daughter Lan Ting.The problem of the film is that it introduces a lot of things to the film that make no sense.  From the hoard of attacking warriors on the dune and they happen to be stuck inside a diner, its reminiscent of the American film ""Legion"" but what is their purpose, we don't know.  It seems that the film tried to incorporate one large action chase scene for action-sake, with nothing impacting the storyline.Before the attack by the dune warriors, we see a soldier attacking Qiao Fei, but what is his purpose in the film?  Why even give this non-essential character a closeup.And then all of a sudden, the film tries to become a zombie/vampire like film when Pork Chop's employees start eating flowers that have grown from a dead corpse, thus making him to a zombie with super abilities.And while it was one thing to introduce these supernatural beasts or whatever they are, we are introduced to a storyline that revolves around a woman named Dao-Dao and the Desert Eagle, which plays an impact to the story in the beginning and about Qiao Fei's past.  But the brief interaction with Desert Eagle is so short that you wonder why the writer chose to introduce it to the storyline.Unfortunately, as much as the film does look cool in terms of its warm colorized look and the visual effects, especially the fight choreography, the film was disappointing.And what makes it even worse is that the film that Yen-ping Chu and Jay Chou did before this, was also the same.  Full of style, cool fight choreography but a storyline that tried to add to much but got nowhere.The Blu-ray release is also ""OK"".  While the picture quality is very good, we are only given a Dolby TrueHD 2.0 soundtrack (Mandarin and in English) and for special features, just a single trailer.Needless to say, Jay Chou fans are going to watch this film because it features Jay Chou.  But the film didn't do well in Taiwan and was a box office failure.  But since Jay Chou has become internationally well-known because of his work on ""The Green Hornet"", the collaboration between him and Yen-ping Chu for their second film together is another mess.It's unfortunate because I respect Jay Chou as a fan of his music and I have been supportive of his growth as an actor, even when he first starred in ""Initial D"", but his two films with Yen-ping Chu may give him that acting experience but unfortunately they are bad films.  Again, these films were made before ""The Green Hornet"", so hopefully, he gets better film roles to star in.""The Treasure Hunter"" is more eye-candy and a popcorn action-film with an anemic, kitschy storyline that is too confusing to be any good.",2,Blu-ray: Definitely not one of Jay Chou's better films...,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,6004,"['Jay', 'Chou', 'talented', 'chart-topping',

1461316,AYG1U47VFZ165,B005HVWVZE,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[2, 4]","Conflict, conflict, conflict.  At the heart of every great story, there is a conflict.  Sometimes, this is a conflict between characters.  Sometimes, it's a conflict between opposing points of view.  Still other times the conflict can be internalized, wherein one character struggles against all odds to achieve a sort of personal best or mythic destiny.  Whatever shape the conflict comes in, some version of it is necessary to push a plot forward - to move characters thematically from Point A to Point B, to force situations to develop organically within the needs of the story.  What you get when you don't really have a pronounced or identifiable conflict is ... well ... what you get oft times is a film like THE TREASURE HUNTER, the kind of picture that there's absolutely nothing wrong with but still feels more than a bit shallow in the development department.For a film less than two hours, TREASURE HUNTER feels surprisingly empty, thin, and lifeless ... which it absolutely shouldn't because there are so many elements up on the screen shared with so many other pictures.  It's one part INDIANA JONES; it's another part ROMANCING THE STONE; it's a few parts of the LARA CROFT movies; and it's a few parts of THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS.  In fact, I could probably take the time to come up with dozens of other influences that come into play with a feature like TREASURE HUNTER, and they would all end up being on a list of pretty solidly produced action films.  They'd be summer blockbuster.  They'd be secret surprise sleeper films.  They'd be anything and everything you could want in a cookie-cutter slam-bang adventure.What's it missing?  Just about everything else needed to make it all mix together successfully.The story feels culled together somewhat from several scripts, and, as best as I could mash it out, a disgraced archaeologist's daughter (played by the wholesome looking Lan Ting) seeks to defend her father's lost legacy.  When it's clear that she knows more than she lets on, the men involved in her father's disappearance kidnap her and speed her off to the desert in search of ... what else ... treasure!  However, these deserts are guarded by a kinda/sorta spiritual knight (played with understated toughness - most likely because he was hidden under so many layers of clothing! - by Jay Chou) - complete with the obligatory martial arts.  Before you know it, he and she join forces in race against the villains to uncover the secret treasure and ... well, I think you get the point.However, the film's central plot hinges on a series of flashbacks that detail the secret history that links these assorted characters together into a single film, and, once we know all that there is to know, it's just not all that interesting.  There's a hook here ... a bit of a surprise there ... but, in the end, nothing pulls the viewer into the action to the point where you genuinely want to CARE about it all.  Chou never really musters any significant charisma to carry the weight of an action film on his shoulders, and Ting never really musters any chemistry opposite her leading man.  For a film steeped in its own magical, mysterious mythology, TREASURE feels mostly lost of any real treasures, and I found that a bit off-putting.  I wanted to like the film far more than what I did, but it never asked me to.This is not to say TREASURE HUNTER is a bad picture.  By any stretch of the imagination, it isn't.  In fact, one could make a strong argument that it's a very good picture.  The production qualities are solid.  The performances certainly appear to be on-the-mark for what was written.  The action set pieces are interesting and very well staged.  It's just that nothing here really pushes the boundaries of what audiences have come to expect from motion pictures.  When you can get a film like this every other weekend at the cineplexes, then something more is needed to elevate one film above the others.  If not, then ... well ... then, like I said, you've left with TREASURE HUNTER.  It's something that feels like it was produced by a studio production system - with its heart and soul removed and left possibly on the cutting room floor where it does no one any good.In the interest of disclosure, I'm happy to say that the folks at FUNimation provided me with an advance copy of the film in order to complete this review.",2,Some Treasures Are Better Left Buried A Few Thousand Years,1321315200,"11 15, 2011",2011,4369,"['Conflict', 'conflict', 'conflict', 'heart', 'great', 'story', 'conflict', 'Sometimes', 'conflict', 'characters', 'Sometimes', 'conflict', 'opposing', 'points', 'view', 'Still', 'other', 'times', 'conflict', 'can', 'be', 'internalized', 'wherein', 'one', 'character', 'odds', 'achieve', 'sort', 'personal', 'best', 'mythic', 'destiny', 'shape', 'conflict', 'version', 'necessary', 'push', 'plot', 'forward', 'move', 'characters', 'thematically', 'Point', 'Point', 'B', 'force', 'situations', 'develop', 'organically', 'needs', 'story', 'What', 'get', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'pronounced', 'identifiable', 'conflict', 'well', 'what', 'get', 'oft', 'times', 'film', 'TREASURE', 'HUNTER', 'kind', 'picture', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'still', 'more', 'bit', 'shallow', 'development', 'film', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'TREASURE', 'HUNTER', 'feels', 'surprisingly', 'empty', 'thin', 'lifeless', 'absolutely', 'should', ""n't"", 'are', 'so', 'many', 'elements', 'up', 'screen', 'shared', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'pictures', 'one', 'part', 'INDIANA', 'JONES', 'part', 'THE', 'STONE', 'few', 'parts', 'LARA', 'CROFT', 'movies', 'few', 'parts', 'THE', 'MUMMY', 'THE', 'MUMMY', 'RETURNS', 'fact', 'could', 'probably', 'take', 'time', 'come', 'up', 'dozens', 'other', 'influences', 'come', 'play', 'feature', 'TREASURE', 'HUNTER', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'list', 'pretty', 'solidly', 'produced', 'action', 'films', ""'d"", 'be', 'summer', 'blockbuster', ""'d"", 'be', 'secret', 'surprise', 'sleeper', 'films', ""'d"", 'be', 'anything', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'cookie-cutter', 'slam-bang', 'adventure.What', 'missing', 'Just', 'everything', 'else', 'needed', 'make', 'mix', 'together', 'successfully.The', 'story', 'feels', 'culled', 'together', 'somewhat', 'several', 'scripts', 'as', 'best', 'could', 'mash', 'out', 'disgraced', 'archaeologist', 'daughter', 'played', 'wholesome', 'looking', 'Lan', 'Ting', 'defend', 'father', 'lost', 'legacy', 'When', 'clear', 'more', 'men', 'involved', 'father', 'disappearance', 'kidnap', 'speed', 'off', 'desert', 'search', 'what', 'else', 'treasure', 'However', 'deserts', 'are', 'guarded', 'kinda/sorta', 'spiritual', 'knight', 'played', 'understated', 'toughness', 'most', 'likely', 'was', 'hidden', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'clothing', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'complete', 'obligatory', 'martial', 'arts', 'know', 'join', 'forces', 'race', 'villains', 'uncover', 'secret', 'treasure', 'well', 'think', 'get', 'point.However', 'film', 'central', 'plot', 'hinges', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'detail', 'secret', 'history', 'assorted', 'characters', 'together', 'single', 'film', 'once', 'know', 'know', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'hook', 'here', 'bit', 'surprise', 'there', 'end', 'nothing', 'viewer', 'action', 'point', 'where', 'genuinely', 'want', 'CARE', 'Chou', 'never', 'really', 'significant', 'charisma', 'carry', 'weight', 'action', 'film', 'shoulders', 'Ting', 'never', 'really', 'chemistry', 'leading', 'man', 'film', 'steeped', 'own', 'magical', 'mysterious', 'mythology', 'TREASURE', 'mostly', 'lost', 'real', 'treasures', 'found', 'bit', 'off-putting', 'wanted', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'what', 'did', 'never', 'asked', 'to.This', 'not', 'say', 'TREASURE', 'HUNTER', 'bad', 'picture', 'stretch', 'imagination', ""n't"", 'fact', 'one', 'could', 'make', 'strong', 'argument', 'very', 'good', 'picture', 'production', 'qualities', 'are', 'solid', 'performances', 'certainly', 'appear', 'be', 'on-the-mark', 'what', 'was', 'written', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'interesting', 'very', 'well', 'staged', 'just', 'nothing', 'here', 'really', 'boundaries', 'what', 'audiences', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'motion', 'pictures', 'When', 'can', 'get', 'film', 'other', 'weekend', 'cineplexes', 'then', 'something', 'more', 'needed', 'elevate', 'one', 'film', 'others', 'not', 'then', 'well', 'then', 'said', ""'ve"", 'left', 'TREASURE', 'HUNTER', 'something', 'was', 'produced', 'studio', 'production', 'system', 'heart', 'soul', 'removed', 'left', 'possibly', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'where', 'one', 'interest', 'disclosure', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'folks', 'FUNimation', 'provided', 'advance', 'copy', 'film', 'order', 'complete', 'review']",Treasure Hunter
