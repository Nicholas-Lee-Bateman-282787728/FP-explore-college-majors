However, what does a stars selfishness offer their friends and others - maybe at least some respect.  What can the star and/or the new friend do for you to make you a better person.  Looking into ones life may help some of you who thing you are a star - at home, school, or wherever see how you are treating others around you.  Do they love you, fear you, jealous of you, or hurtful and mean?  This move was awesome with the way the handled the subject.
