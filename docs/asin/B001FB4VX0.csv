Some of the characters seem shallow (I know more than they usually are) and the parents have no control over these kids but the episodes get stronger towards the end of the season. Actually my favorite episode this season was the '80s flashback of Lily as a teen featuring Brittany Snow, that was awesome and creative. Leighton Meester is a hoot, her comic timing is impeccable and when she lets herself be vulnerable - it's pure magic! Blake Lively's character was kinda cool when she played a witcher version of Serena, she was more real that way than the whole doe-eyed sympathetic teen. The fashion is to die for, the music is fresh, and the off-color jokes work really well, I just wish this show wasn't so calculated and wooden.

Logan ""Missy""","[0, 0]","While GG's second season is filled with scandal, secrets, and surprises at every turn -- in some ways it loses some of the spark and originality that the first season embodied so effortlessly. The on again/off again romances between several couples on the show become redundant and tiresome. And new love interests are brought in for the main characters far too frequently. These new love interests are cast out just as quickly as they're brought in. They don't stay long enough to make an impression, nor does the viewer actually care about their relationships with the main characters. That may be my biggest quarrel with season 2. Relationships start and stop too abruptly; at the drop of a dime -- making most relationships on the show seem meaningless.However, season 2 brings us some memorable moments as well. We witness the death of a legendary character and the baring it has on the other characters. Several characters undergo significant growth and development as well; namely Blair, Jenny, Chuck, and Lily. There are defining moments and big reveals that may keep you guessing and wondering what will happen next. Season 2 nears the end of the high school era for our characters as well. They wrap up their senior year and prepare for college. And we journey with the characters as they experience those memorable high school milestones; college visits, prom, graduation -- but they experience them with a scandalous Upper East Side twist.All in all, season 2 is solid and certainly worth the watch. While it may be repetitive at times, and lack the excitement and imagination of season 1, the second season has some memorable moments and manages to be just entertaining enough to keep the viewer interested.",3,An okay season -- 3 1/2 Stars,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,1720,"['GG', 'second', 'season', 'filled', 'scandal', 'secrets', 'surprises', 'turn', 'ways', 'spark', 'originality', 'first', 'season', 'embodied', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'again/off', 'again', 'romances', 'several', 'couples', 'show', 'become', 'redundant', 'tiresome', 'new', 'love', 'interests', 'are', 'brought', 'main', 'characters', 'far', 'too', 'frequently', 'new', 'love', 'interests', 'are', 'cast', 'out', 'just', 'as', 'quickly', ""'re"", 'brought', 'do', ""n't"", 'stay', 'long', 'enough', 'make', 'impression', 'viewer', 'actually', 'care', 'relationships', 'main', 'characters', 'may', 'be', 'biggest', 'quarrel', 'season', '2', 'Relationships', 'start', 'stop', 'too', 'abruptly', 'drop', 'dime', 'making', 'most', 'relationships', 'show', 'seem', 'meaningless.However', 'season', '2', 'brings', 'memorable', 'moments', 'well', 'witness', 'death', 'legendary', 'character', 'baring', 'other', 'characters', 'Several', 'characters', 'undergo', 'significant', 'growth', 'development', 'as', 'well', 'namely', 'Blair', 'Jenny', 'Chuck', 'Lily', 'are', 'defining', 'moments', 'big', 'reveals', 'may', 'keep', 'guessing', 'wondering', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'Season', '2', 'end', 'high', 'school', 'era', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'wrap', 'up', 'senior', 'year', 'prepare', 'college', 'journey', 'characters', 'experience', 'memorable', 'high', 'school', 'milestones', 'college', 'visits', 'prom', 'graduation', 'experience', 'scandalous', 'Upper', 'East', 'Side', 'twist.All', 'season', '2', 'solid', 'certainly', 'watch', 'may', 'be', 'repetitive', 'times', 'lack', 'excitement', 'imagination', 'season', '1', 'second', 'season', 'memorable', 'moments', 'manages', 'be', 'just', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'keep', 'viewer', 'interested']",N/A

1188362,A211TYB51TIZ6Q,B001FB4VX0,"J. McQueen ""Anti-Charisma""","[2, 3]","Season 2 was better than Season 1. Substantially better. With this having been said, I believe that the series isn't living up to its potential.The fictional couple of Blair and Chuck is the most intriguing teenage couple that I have seen on television since the cast of ""My So Called Life"" years ago. The two of them chew up the scenery and make other pairings (Dan and Serena, for example) look pretty vanilla in comparision.With that having been said, the Season could have been better.We learn that Nate Archibald is the scion of political royalty in New York. Despite the disgrace that befell his father, Nate's grandfather is pushing him toward becoming a power player. With his looks, charms and pedigree, the grandfather believes that Nate could be a political and social juggernaut -- and he's probably right. The grandfather initially see Blair as an ally who can help him further his plans for Nate. So much could have been done with this plot and it simply wasn't;  and this was truly a shame!This was the show's chance to really dig into the social pressure that come from powerful parents' expectations of their children and the romantic and platonic relationship sacrifices that come with these sometimes crushing expectations. Instead, the writers reduces this conflict to Nate deciding between going to Yale (where connection guaranteed his admission) and NYU (in which Nate got into on his own merit). How trivial!Gossip Girl has the potential to be as big as the original Beverly Hills 90210, but it has to have the courage to allow its best characters to shine and to really take a deeper approach to showcasing the challenges its cast faces.  -- ""You know you love me.

1188365,A16QODENBJVUI1,B001FB4VX0,Robert Moore,"[40, 49]","I'm probably going to be in a minority here, but more and more I became unhappy with GOSSIP GIRL in its second season.  It isn't the characters.  The show has a nice ensemble cast, nearly all of them nicely acted by the performers portraying them.To explain why I have been increasingly discontent with the show, I need to call attention to one of the reasons I have enjoyed Josh Schwartz's two other shows.  Both THE O.C. and CHUCK are character based serials.  Both tell stories about how characters change and evolve over multiple episodes.  For instance, a conflict between Summer and Seth on THE O.C. might develop and get resolved over a 14 or 15 episode arc.  Story arcs for any of the major characters would extend over whole seasons.  Much the same is true with CHUCK.  The friendship between Chuck and Casey, for instance, took pretty much two full seasons to develop.Now, contrast this with GOSSIP GIRL.  More and more GOSSIP GIRL has become a show for viewers with attention deficit disorder.  My guess is that the main inspiration for the increasingly shorter and shorter story arcs is the CW.  This isn't the kind of change in a show that producers like to make.  I blame the CW.  Basically networks hate story arcs.  They absolutely abhor shows have complex story arcs that extend over 7 or 8 or 9 episodes.  This tension has been a part of prime time television ever since HILL STREET BLUES popularized story arcs on American television.  But the network decreed that there could be only six separate arcs at a time, that preferably no arc would extend beyond six weeks, and at least one arc would be resolve each week.Dedicated fans of shows generally love story arcs.  Shows like BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, LOST, BREAKING BAD, TRUE BLOOD, DOLLHOUSE, THE GILMORE GIRLS, VERONICA MARS, and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA get fanatical fans in large part because of the complexity of the stories.  Networks hate the complex arcs because while the stories are thrilling for the ongoing fans, potential new fans can find the complexity of the stories too intimidating.  The pattern for most such shows is a general loss of viewership as the shows go along.  If you didn't get into LOST at the beginning, it is tough to jump in later.Along the way -- that is, between 1981 and the present -- TV developed some alternatives that for casual TV viewers are ideals, but that for serious TV viewers felt regressive.  The network that has almost completely embraced these alternative is CBS, which is almost fully committed to procedurals, whether medical, legal, or criminal.  These shows do not have arcs.  Each episode tells a self-contained story.  All the conflict introduced in each episode is resolved in that episode.  There is no character development.  In a way, nothing ever happens on those shows.  Jerry Orbach's character on LAW AND ORDER was the same on the last day of his very, very, very long run on the show as on the very first day.Which brings us to GOSSIP GIRL.  Season One of GOSSIP GIRL more or less focused on long story arcs.  Dan and Serena's relationship developed over much of the season.  Blair and Nate's relationship ended very, very slowly and her relationship with Chuck developed even more slowly.  This made for good TV and for very satisfying viewing.Season Two of GOSSIP GIRL, however, almost completely abandoned the long story arc.  What would have been major romantic arcs in Season One were completed in two or three episodes.  We frequently saw a character meet a new romantic interest, have that relationship dealt with in a couple of episodes, and then ended.  If you take any character on the show and map their story over the course of the year, they went through a large number of changes.  The pace of the show was dizzying.  And increasingly unsatisfying.  The show repeatedly proved that more is sometimes less.By the end of Season Two, I was on the fence about whether to continue watching it.  I still am.  By the end of Season Two I was so irritated by what I knew was going to be merely a two or three episode arc that I could barely make myself watch it.  The show became trivial.  If something happened between Nate and Blair, you knew that two more episodes might see a complete reversal.  Any relationship between any two characters was rendered almost meaningless.  I knew that nothing that happened on the show would hold true for more than a couple of episodes.  Contrast this with Seth and Summer's relationship on THE O.C.  One reason that it was compelling was that while they went through their ups and downs, they managed to stick together for several years.Is there any hope for GOSSIP GIRL?  I'm doubtful at this point.  Although the ratings for the show were atrocious, it scored high in the demographic that the CW is targeting as its main viewer base:  young girls.  But more and more it ceased being a show that could also appeal to adults.  The WB build much of its base on shows that appealed both to teens and adults, shows like BUFFY, THE GILMORE GIRLS, and FELICITY.  But if it continues to avoid long story arcs, the viewership for GOSSIP GIRL is going to be increasingly that of people who only like very short story arcs.  I'm not optimistic.  This is too bad, because they have some good, likable characters.  I would like to be given stories concerning them about which I could be interested.",3,Great characters but increasing narrative problems threaten the future of the show,1245456000,"06 20,

Casanova ""*~SiL~*""","[2, 6]","After watching season one over and over again i can wait any longer to do the same with season two, this show's great, i find it really entertaining. Even though some people made valid critics about this season im happy with the result, i actually like the mess and short stories, like random lovers, unexplained situations because i think that makes the show seem more real, they are young people finishing high school when you are young you go from one thing to another in a matter of days( or minutes), to me watching the problems of a couple 1-2-3... episodes it's boring, i like changes/new characters/drama and this season has a lot of it. Blair and Chuck story was the best one, it seemed like they weren't going to make it but they did at the mere end.I miss Dan and Serena but i liked Dan having an affair with a professor( i didnt think he would do something like that) and Serena with Eric and then hooking up with her friend's boyfriend, that was so S.Jenny's wild side and then growing up and finding her truth identity.Nate having an affair with a married older woman, Kissing jenny,breaking up with Vanessa( yay!).Georginas come back.Lily and Rufus story( the lost son, the back to the 80's, the wedding plans)Blair and Marcus,hooking up Carter ending up with Nate again, and finally Chuck... thats what i call a season!!!Cant wait for season 3!!XOXO",5,Best show ever!,1248220800,"07 22, 2009",2009,1365,"['watching', 'season', 'one', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'i', 'can', 'wait', 'longer', 'do', 'same', 'season', 'two', 'show', 'great', 'i', 'find', 'really', 'entertaining', 'Even', 'people', 'made', 'valid', 'critics', 'season', 'happy', 'result', 'i', 'actually', 'mess', 'short', 'stories', 'random', 'lovers', 'unexplained', 'situations', 'i', 'think', 'show', 'seem', 'more', 'real', 'are', 'young', 'people', 'finishing', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'are', 'young', 'go', 'one', 'thing', 'matter', 'days', 'minutes', 'watching', 'problems', 'couple', '1-2-3', 'boring', 'i', 'changes/new', 'characters/drama', 'season', 'lot', 'Blair', 'Chuck', 'story', 'was', 'best', 'one', 'seemed', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'make', 'did', 'mere', 'end.I', 'miss', 'Dan', 'Serena', 'i', 'liked', 'Dan', 'having', 'affair', 'professor', 'i', 'didnt', 'think', 'would', 'do', 'something', 'Serena', 'Eric', 'then', 'hooking', 'up', 'friend', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'so', 'S.Jenny', 'wild', 'side', 'then', 'growing', 'up', 'finding', 'truth', 'identity.Nate', 'having', 'affair', 'married', 'older', 'woman', 'Kissing', 'jenny', 'breaking', 'up', 'Vanessa', 'yay', 'come', 'back.Lily', 'Rufus', 'story', 'lost', 'son', 'back', '80', 'wedding', 'plans', 'Blair', 'Marcus', 'hooking', 'up', 'Carter', 'ending', 'up', 'Nate', 'again', 'finally', 'Chuck', 'what', 'i', 'call', 'season', 'Cant', 'wait', 'season', '3', 'XOXO']",N/A
