135595,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,0792833759,AbeStreet,"[1, 1]","This story has been with me in one form or another since I was a toddler. I grew up reading Walter Farley's books. I began as a toddler with the Little Black Pony stories and The Big Black Horse, which is a scaled down version of The Black Stallion. The Big Black Horse deals with the portion of the story that takes place on the boat and then moves to the island that Alec and the Black were stranded on. It ends with their rescue. As a pre-teen and young teenager I read almost all the Black Stallion books that had been written up to that point at time, the late 70's and early 80's. When I heard that a film was being written I was so very excited. However when I first saw the film I was disappointed. It was no fault of the film makers but rather a fault of my own imagination. After having read so many of the Black Stallion books I had created my own ideas of what everyone, everyplace, and everything should look like. This is one of the great things about reading, each reader creates their own unique images. The movie in many ways was at a disadvantage, in no way could it satisfy the thousand of fans who had been reading the books for nearly four decades. Anyway, I thought the film moved a little slow and while sticking fairly close to the book failed to capture my interest like the books did.Jump ahead 25 years and I have a new take. I recently purchased the DVD. I figured what the heck, it's reasonably priced and I did like the story. As I watched the film as an adult I found that I really enjoyed it in a way I hadn't as a child. The movie lets the images tell the story, no need for narration or long drawn out dialogue . The sets are really well done and I never sensed that any portion of the film was made on a studio back lot. The story moves at a good pace and is not drawn out too long. The casting was very well done. Micky Rooney was great as the old jockey turned trainer, Henry Dailey. African American screen legend Clarence Muse did well in the role of Snoe. Muse was 90 years old when the film was made and died just before the film was released. This was really a well put together movie. I would suggest that you watch it when you're not busy doing something else at the same time. If you are able to sit down and allow yourself to focus your attention on the film you'll find yourself really drawn into the story. I can pretty much guarantee you'll find yourself cheering during the race at the end of the movie. The final race and the part of the story that takes place on the island are my two favorite parts of the movie.Lastly, as for the DVD, I don't know who the DVD manufacturers thought they were fooling when they called this a ""widescreen release""? Instead of releasing the true widescreen version they simply stretched the pan & scan version and added black bars to the bottom and top of the picture. I would suggest you, for those who are able, shrink the image and watch it in normal pan & scan mode. It is better viewed in this aspect ratio than the stretched version the DVD manufacturers would have you watch.",4,Faithful to the original story!,1109721600,"03 2, 2005",2005,3066,"['story', 'been', 'one', 'form', 'was', 'toddler', 'grew', 'up', 'reading', 'Walter', 'Farley', 'books', 'began', 'toddler', 'Little', 'Black', 'Pony', 'stories', 'Big', 'Black', 'Horse', 'scaled', 'down', 'version', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'Big', 'Black', 'Horse', 'deals', 'portion', 'story', 'place', 'boat', 'then', 'moves', 'island', 'Alec', 'Black', 'were', 'stranded', 'rescue', 'pre-teen', 'young', 'teenager', 'read', 'almost', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'books', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'up', 'point', 'time', 'late', '70', 'early', '80', 'When', 'heard', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'written', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'excited', 'However', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', 'fault', 'film', 'makers', 'rather', 'fault', 'own', 'imagination', 'having', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'books', 'had', 'created', 'own', 'ideas', 'what', 'everyone', 'everyplace', 'everything', 'should', 'look', 'one', 'great', 'things', 'reading', 'reader', 'own', 'unique', 'images', 'movie', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'disadvantage', 'way', 'could', 'satisfy', 'thousand', 'fans', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'reading', 'books', 'nearly', 'four', 'decades', 'Anyway', 'thought', 'film', 'moved', 'little', 'slow', 'sticking', 'fairly', 'close', 'book', 'failed', 'capture', 'interest', 'books', 'did.Jump', 'ahead', '25', 'years', 'have', 'new', 'take', 'recently', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'figured', 'what', 'heck', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'did', 'story', 'watched', 'film', 'adult', 'found', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'had', ""n't"", 'child', 'movie', 'images', 'tell', 'story', 'need', 'narration', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'dialogue', 'sets', 'are', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'never', 'sensed', 'portion', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'studio', 'back', 'lot', 'story', 'moves', 'good', 'pace', 'not', 'drawn', 'out', 'too', 'long', 'casting', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Micky', 'Rooney', 'was', 'great', 'old', 'jockey', 'turned', 'trainer', 'Henry', 'Dailey', 'African', 'American', 'screen', 'legend', 'Clarence', 'Muse', 'did', 'well', 'role', 'Snoe', 'Muse', 'was', '90', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'died', 'just', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'together', 'movie', 'would', 'suggest', 'watch', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'busy', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'able', 'sit', 'down', 'allow', 'focus', 'attention', 'film', ""'ll"", 'find', 'really', 'story', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'find', 'cheering', 'race', 'end', 'movie', 'final', 'race', 'part', 'story', 'place', 'island', 'are', 'two', 'favorite', 'parts', 'movie.Lastly', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'DVD', 'manufacturers', 'thought', 'were', 'fooling', 'when', 'called', 'widescreen', 'release', 'Instead', 'releasing', 'true', 'widescreen', 'version', 'simply', 'stretched', 'pan', 'scan', 'version', 'added', 'black', 'bars', 'bottom', 'top', 'picture', 'would', 'suggest', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'shrink', 'image', 'watch', 'normal', 'pan', 'scan', 'mode', 'better', 'viewed', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'stretched', 'version', 'DVD', 'manufacturers', 'would', 'have', 'watch']",N/A

135599,A1IQVBGOYVEFBI,0792833759,Allan Brain,"[2, 2]","I first saw this movie over twenty years ago, on the big screen at one of the local theatres.  It reminded me then of the kinds of movies I loved as a child, full of adventure, but also full of emotions that haunt the world of childhood--loneliness, wonder, hope, admiration.  All of these are in this movie, especially in the brilliant first half, depicting a boy who has the cruelest adventure imaginable, but also an awakening to a new world of natural beauty and another kind of adventure.  The first hour of this movie, with a shipwreck,  a young boy, the only survivor, other than a fierce and wild horse who somehow bonds with him, is beautiful and moving almost beyond belief.The second half is a more traditional thriller, as the horse becomes a champion race horse, is almost formulaic, but it is done so well that what might be called &quot;manipulation&quot; is not heavy-handed or noticeable in the way that it is in most movies made in the last decade.  And having Mickey Rooney in a starring role as the horse trainer is a special treat for those of us who remember him in the movies of the '50s.This is a movie that you can watch with your kids, or with your parents, and everyone will enjoy it.I bought the DVD version for some friends' kids who I knew had never seen this movie--they have seen everything from the last ten years, mostly a lot of junk.

135609,A2WLZD9BY669HY,0792833759,Candace Scott,"[4, 5]","What a beautiful motion picture this is. Not only it is gorgeously photographed, it is quite simply breathtaking in many respects. Though many people will feel the film is too slowly paced, it's never plodding, just leisurely. The opening boat sequence is directed and photographed so perfectly that it boggles the mind. Those who think that James Cameron's special effects during the sinking of &quot;Titanic&quot; are anything special need to see the boat sink in this piece. There's no comparison.There is a 45 minute sequence on the island with Kelly Reno and the stallion. This is only portion of the film which does lag just a trifle. There's no dialogue and the tender love that grows between boy and horse is very deliberately filmed. It does seem improbable that the boy could survive alone on the island with only a pocket knife, but you have to just accept the dubious and revel in the lush photography and understated elegance.Ther performances are uniformly superb. Kelly Reno is excellent as the boy, but the film ultimately belongs to Mickey Rooney, a naturally charasmatic and gifted actor who never appears to be acting. He steals the film because he's always brilliant and his character is enigmatic and made interesting because Rooney is playing him.

135610,A1IZ5TJ1SKOT8Y,0792833759,Cannucklehead Film Addict,"[2, 2]","The beauty of Caroll Ballard's first feature film is that it never gets a step wrong &#8211; nothing is over-extended, nothing is too short, everything is perfectly judged and beautifully assembled. This is a film in three parts, essentially. First, the boy and the horse on the island; second, the boy and the horse training; and third, the big race. In all three parts, most of the story is told without dialogue, or rather, the dialogue you hear is not really essential to seeing the story unfold in front of you visually. In any event, most of the dialogue occurs in the middle section of the film, the training sequences, and again, it's not essential to understanding the story. The race sequence was, in 1982, the most exciting and visceral horse race ever put on film, and it still is absolutely spell-binding and thrilling. Since 1982, of course, we've been shown &#34;Seabiscuit,&#34; with its many horse races, but the latter film owes a lot to this one, in fact, I would go so far as to say that the makers of &#34;Seabiscuit&#34; probably prepared by watching this one many many times over, so they could get it right. I love this film, and I have since I first saw it (when it came out), and it occurred to me then that a film which can save one of its most stunning shots &#8211; the boy and the horse on the beach, a rainbow behind them; and a real rainbow, not a CGI rainbow &#8211; for the final credit role, was a film which had beauties galore and to spare; how many film-makers can take a marvellous shot like that and essentially toss it away? Answer: only those film-makers who know their craft inside and out, and who know that picture and story are the thing, not just picture, not just story. Incidentally, the film was shot by ace cinematographer (and sometime director) Caleb Deschanel, whose work you should look up on IMDb; he's been around for a while, and he is one of the best photographers currently working.As to the blu-ray, the transfer is good, but if I had to guess, I would say that it has been transferred from a print, rather than the OCN, and while the colours and contrast mostly look good, it's also quite clear that the image has been artificially sharpened; in some of the island sequences where there is a moderate amount of backlighting, you can clearly see EE haloes around both boy and horse. This might have been done to &#34;correct&#34; the inherent softness that comes from using a source that's at least one generation away from the original negative. Even so, this is superior to the DVD transfer, and has pretty good sound as well. Small tip: watch this in a darkened room. Why? The early scenes, the ship sinking, and so on, take place at night, and the images for this sequence were always dark. In a lighter room, where your eyes are not dark-adjusted, you will have a hard time making out what's going on, whereas in a darkened room, it's easier to make things out.This is a film that recaptures the elation and energy of youth, when you feel that anything is possible.",5,Brilliant film,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,3031,"['beauty', 'Caroll', 'Ballard', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'never', 'step', 'wrong', '8211', 'nothing', 'over-extended', 'nothing', 'too', 'short', 'everything', 'perfectly', 'judged', 'beautifully', 'assembled', 'film', 'three', 'parts', 'essentially', 'First', 'boy', 'horse', 'island', 'second', 'boy', 'horse', 'training', 'third', 'big', 'race', 'three', 'parts', 'most', 'story', 'told', 'dialogue', 'rather', 'dialogue', 'hear', 'not', 'really', 'essential', 'seeing', 'story', 'unfold', 'front', 'visually', 'event', 'most', 'dialogue', 'middle', 'section', 'film', 'training', 'sequences', 'again', 'not', 'essential', 'understanding', 'story', 'race', 'sequence', 'was', '1982', 'most', 'exciting', 'visceral', 'horse', 'race', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'still', 'absolutely', 'spell-binding', 'thrilling', '1982', 'course', ""'ve"", 'been', 'shown', '34', 'Seabiscuit', '34', 'many', 'horse', 'races', 'latter', 'film', 'lot', 'one', 'fact', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'makers', '34', 'Seabiscuit', '34', 'probably', 'prepared', 'watching', 'one', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'could', 'get', 'right', 'love', 'film', 'have', 'first', 'saw', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'occurred', 'then', 'film', 'can', 'save', 'one', 'most', 'stunning', 'shots', '8211', 'boy', 'horse', 'beach', 'rainbow', 'real', 'rainbow', 'not', 'CGI', 'rainbow', '8211', 'final', 'credit', 'role', 'was', 'film', 'had', 'beauties', 'galore', 'spare', 'how', 'many', 'film-makers', 'can', 'take', 'marvellous', 'shot', 'essentially', 'toss', 'away', 'Answer', 'only', 'film-makers', 'who', 'know', 'craft', 'inside', 'who', 'know', 'picture', 'story', 'are', 'thing', 'not', 'just', 'picture', 'not', 'just', 'story', 'Incidentally', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'ace', 'cinematographer', 'sometime', 'director', 'Caleb', 'Deschanel', 'work', 'should', 'look', 'up', 'IMDb', 'been', 'while', 'one', 'best', 'photographers', 'currently', 'working.As', 'blu-ray', 'transfer', 'good', 'had', 'guess', 'would', 'say', 'been', 'transferred', 'print', 'rather', 'OCN', 'colours', 'contrast', 'mostly', 'look', 'good', 'also', 'quite', 'clear', 'image', 'been', 'artificially', 'sharpened', 'island', 'where', 'moderate', 'amount', 'backlighting', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'EE', 'haloes', 'boy', 'horse', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'done', '34', 'correct', '34', 'inherent', 'softness', 'using', 'source', 'least', 'one', 'generation', 'away', 'original', 'negative', 'Even', 'so', 'superior', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'pretty', 'good', 'sound', 'well', 'Small', 'tip', 'watch', 'darkened', 'room', 'Why', 'early', 'scenes', 'ship', 'sinking', 'so', 'take', 'place', 'night', 'images', 'sequence', 'were', 'always', 'dark', 'lighter', 'room', 'where', 'eyes', 'are', 'not', 'dark-adjusted', 'will', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'making', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'whereas', 'darkened', 'room', 'easier', 'make', 'things', 'film', 'elation', 'energy', 'youth', 'when', 'feel', 'anything', 'possible']",N/A

This relationship begins at a point when the boy loses his father in the trackless wilderness of the sea.As the plot develops, the story is also about the relationship that develops between the boy and a middle-aged, erstwhile fine jockey.The general theme here is about relationships between friends, this wild-and-human one, and also the relationship of a young boy with a father mentor.  Also, I would say,the theme is about how the relationships in the movie enable a process in which the training of wild life-energies become channeled into ""winning forces"" within the context of civilization, but this is only an implicit theme, it is not spelled out.The way that Francis Ford Coppola does this movie, it is an almost meditative poem for the senses of sound and sight while also being a heartwarming story about likable characters.  Plus there is the focal point of the fearful magnetism (like that of Blake's ""Tiger, tiger, burning bright...."") of this stunning, amazing, beautiful creature of wild nature, the stallion.  --If the horse that played the part wasn't really wild, he was a very good actor.There's very little dialogue in the film.  One feels noticeably, I think, how slowly the plot moves as it proceeds toward the boy's meeting with the horse trainer which doesn't get going until  after about an hour into the story.  Then, the action picks up and moves faster until the climactic race, with its tension-producing complications, at the end.I think this is a movie that might bore quite a few children and young people, despite a passing interest they might have in the boy and the horse.  However, I could be wrong.  I like the movie as an adult, but I can feature myself having liked it as a child, too.  There may be various children who would like the movie at various levels of appreciation.  Generally speaking, I'd say the movie would be BEST appreciated by those adults who have developed keener senses of aesthetics and fairly refined sensibilities.  It IS an outstanding and beautiful movie, so it should be watched with patient expectations by those who WILL appreciate it and who will probably remember it happily.I was a little irritated with the way the boy's mother was portrayed.  A very pretty and not unlikeable lady about whom there was a sense of eros (and poutiness?) that didn't seem to have any reason for being in the story...  (Her prettiness and the ""prettiness"" of the town and other non-wilderness scenery reminded me very much of a typical Hallmark movie in which the appearance of sets and characters is somewhat sentimentalized.  The strategy of using this mode was probably that it is an appropriate one in this particular movie as a way of presenting a beautiful and idealized sort of setting for a children's story which is a clean and innocent story with somewhat sentimental, heart-moving intentions--very lovely, really.)",5,"Wild wonder, aesthetically beautiful, at times a meditative poem of sight and sound.",1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,3024,"['story', 'relationship', 'boy', 'violently', 'wild', 'desert', 'stallion', 'been', 'presumably', 'captured', 'Arabia', 'relationship', 'point', 'when', 'boy', 'father', 'trackless', 'wilderness', 'sea.As', 'plot', 'story', 'also', 'relationship', 'boy', 'middle-aged', 'erstwhile', 'fine', 'jockey.The', 'general', 'theme', 'here', 'relationships', 'friends', 'wild-and-human', 'one', 'also', 'relationship', 'young', 'boy', 'father', 'mentor', 'Also', 'would', 'say', 'theme', 'how', 'relationships', 'movie', 'enable', 'process', 'training', 'wild', 'life-energies', 'become', 'channeled', 'winning', 'forces', 'context', 'civilization', 'only', 'implicit', 'theme', 'not', 'spelled', 'out.The', 'way', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'movie', 'almost', 'meditative', 'poem', 'senses', 'sound', 'sight', 'also', 'being', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'likable', 'characters', 'focal', 'point', 'fearful', 'magnetism', 'Blake', 'Tiger', 'tiger', 'burning', 'bright', 'stunning', 'amazing', 'beautiful', 'creature', 'wild', 'nature', 'stallion', 'horse', 'played', 'part', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'wild', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'actor.There', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'film', 'One', 'noticeably', 'think', 'how', 'slowly', 'plot', 'boy', 'meeting', 'horse', 'trainer', ""n't"", 'get', 'going', 'hour', 'story', 'Then', 'action', 'up', 'moves', 'faster', 'climactic', 'race', 'tension-producing', 'complications', 'end.I', 'think', 'movie', 'might', 'bore', 'quite', 'few', 'children', 'young', 'people', 'passing', 'interest', 'might', 'have', 'boy', 'horse', 'However', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'movie', 'adult', 'can', 'feature', 'having', 'liked', 'child', 'too', 'may', 'be', 'various', 'children', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'movie', 'various', 'levels', 'appreciation', 'Generally', 'speaking', ""'d"", 'say', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'BEST', 'appreciated', 'adults', 'who', 'have', 'developed', 'keener', 'senses', 'aesthetics', 'fairly', 'refined', 'sensibilities', 'outstanding', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'patient', 'expectations', 'who', 'WILL', 'appreciate', 'who', 'will', 'probably', 'remember', 'was', 'little', 'irritated', 'way', 'boy', 'mother', 'was', 'portrayed', 'very', 'pretty', 'not', 'unlikeable', 'lady', 'whom', 'was', 'sense', 'eros', 'poutiness', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'reason', 'being', 'story', 'prettiness', 'prettiness', 'town', 'other', 'non-wilderness', 'scenery', 'reminded', 'very', 'much', 'typical', 'Hallmark', 'movie', 'appearance', 'sets', 'characters', 'somewhat', 'sentimentalized', 'strategy', 'using', 'mode', 'was', 'probably', 'appropriate', 'one', 'particular', 'movie', 'way', 'presenting', 'beautiful', 'idealized', 'sort', 'setting', 'children', 'story', 'clean', 'innocent', 'story', 'somewhat', 'sentimental', 'heart-moving', 'intentions', 'very', 'lovely', 'really']",N/A

And as has been mentioned, it makes the character of Alec Ramsey much younger than he was in the original book.  Homeward bound on an ocean liner with his father from an  unspecified journey in 1946, he is entranced by a fighting black stallion being trasnported aboard the ship by a group of Arabs.  When the liner is wrecked, he helps the horse escape its stall, then grabs hold of its trailing ties to save himself in the churning waters.  He awakens on a rocky island, where he soon finds that his only company is the horse.  After ""the Black"" kills a cobra menacing him, the two become friends and playmates: soon Alec is riding bareback down the beach by day, pillowing his head on the horse's side by night.  Rescued by Portuguese fishermen and returned to the US, they fall in with former race trainer Henry Dailey, who confirms the Black's true speed, arranges for a racing columnist to see him in action, and prepares them to take part in a three-way match race with the country's two greatest racers.Reno's biography gives his age as 13 at the time of release, but he looks closer to 10.  The child of ranchers, he had been riding most of his life, and almost certainly did all his own horseback sequences (definitely the bareback ones on the island, which were probably the hardest).  (IMDB lists the chief trainer as Bud Reno, possibly his father or older brother.)  There's an almost mystical quality to the island sequences, and several memorable scenes, including Alec's father playing poker with a motley group of passengers (who put down stakes as strangely assorted as themselves), the Black's infuriated response to the incursion of a garbage collector on the Ramsey back yard where he's been temporarily lodged, his frantic gallop through the streets of the commercial district, and, of course, the racing scenes--from Belmont during a pouring nighttime rain, when the Black is invisible and your only hint of his presence is the distant rhythm of his hooves, to Santa Anita during the match race.  The music might have been more majestic (I can't help wondering what Goldsmith would have done with it), and the pace isn't for everyone.

135621,A31ELTOVZM5JHR,0792833759,C. Rothlind,"[2, 2]","What I love about this film is how it listens to itself. Accoustically and visually.The balance of ambient and diegetic sounds feels perfect and always serves to deepen the experiences being presented rather than telling us how to feel about them. The sensitivity to acoustic nuances feels positively Asian, while the music itself covers a wide spectrum of styles. There is fanfare at the ca. 31st minute mark as the stallion looks down from the cliff and the boy gazes up; and again at the 42nd mark to celebrate the apotheosis of the boy-horse unification, but it soon fades out to the ambient sound of the ocean. As the boy teases the stallion with a hand-full of seaweed all we hear are little wooden taps. To their frolicking in the waves we hear the breathless beating of bongo drum, which gives way to a ruminative harp as the boy buries his face in the horses mane before the setting sun. Then the real stroke of genius: diegetic scoring is silenced as we hear only the surge of the surf, the sun on the horizon partially hidden behind clouds.Touches like that that had me intently absorbed in the film. Carroll Baker's sensitive direction and Deschanel's stunning visuals cast a hypnotic spell. Sublime images, evocative-discrete scoring, and off-beat orchestration create a cinematic state-of-grace.Baker takes his material seriously without freighting it with undue symbolism.During the horse race all we hear is the thundering of hooves and an occasional cheer from the crowd. No hysterical calling of the proceedings, an almost unheard of omission. Eventually, as the tide begins to turn, a gentle drone obtrudes to draw us away from the moment to a distanced perspective while scenes of their original ocean-side carousing are woven in. The actual award ceremony is discretely telescoped as anti-climax so the film can get back, over the ending credits, to the numinous core of the story: the idyllic communion of a boy and his balletic stallion in a mytho-poetic realm beyond civilization.",5,Mytho-poetic sublimity for the child in us all,1348012800,"09 19, 2012",2012,2004,"['What', 'love', 'film', 'how', 'Accoustically', 'visually.The', 'balance', 'ambient', 'diegetic', 'sounds', 'feels', 'perfect', 'always', 'serves', 'deepen', 'experiences', 'being', 'presented', 'rather', 'telling', 'how', 'feel', 'sensitivity', 'acoustic', 'nuances', 'feels', 'positively', 'Asian', 'music', 'wide', 'spectrum', 'styles', 'fanfare', 'ca', '31st', 'minute', 'mark', 'stallion', 'down', 'cliff', 'boy', 'up', 'again', '42nd', 'mark', 'celebrate', 'apotheosis', 'boy-horse', 'unification', 'soon', 'out', 'ambient', 'sound', 'ocean', 'boy', 'stallion', 'hand-full', 'seaweed', 'hear', 'are', 'little', 'wooden', 'taps', 'frolicking', 'waves', 'hear', 'breathless', 'beating', 'bongo', 'drum', 'way', 'ruminative', 'harp', 'boy', 'face', 'horses', 'mane', 'setting', 'sun', 'Then', 'real', 'stroke', 'genius', 'diegetic', 'scoring', 'silenced', 'hear', 'only', 'surge', 'surf', 'sun', 'horizon', 'partially', 'hidden', 'clouds.Touches', 'had', 'intently', 'absorbed', 'film', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'sensitive', 'direction', 'Deschanel', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'cast', 'hypnotic', 'spell', 'Sublime', 'images', 'evocative-discrete', 'scoring', 'off-beat', 'orchestration', 'create', 'cinematic', 'state-of-grace.Baker', 'material', 'seriously', 'freighting', 'undue', 'symbolism.During', 'horse', 'race', 'hear', 'thundering', 'hooves', 'occasional', 'cheer', 'crowd', 'hysterical', 'calling', 'proceedings', 'almost', 'unheard', 'omission', 'Eventually', 'tide', 'turn', 'gentle', 'drone', 'draw', 'away', 'moment', 'distanced', 'perspective', 'scenes', 'original', 'ocean-side', 'carousing', 'are', 'woven', 'actual', 'award', 'ceremony', 'discretely', 'telescoped', 'anti-climax', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'ending', 'credits', 'numinous', 'core', 'story', 'idyllic', 'communion', 'boy', 'balletic', 'stallion', 'mytho-poetic', 'realm', 'civilization']",N/A

Both Ballard and Deschanel (and Mathiessen) excelled at capturing all the beauty and action inherent in the story.  And as a long-time fan of the series (I started reading it when I was 6--yes ""The Black Stallion"", not ""Little Black Pony""--I was glad the producers followed the book.  I would have wished Alec was portrayed by someone slightly older (he's a teenager in the book),but Kelly Reno did fine.  All in all, I agree with all the superlative reviews the original film received.  However...The transfer to DVD is atrocious.  Yes, the 'widescreen format' is NOT truly widescreen but a stretched anamorfic which is very noticeable.  But more egregious...WHERE IS THE COLOR CORRECTION!!?

The Black, played by Cass-Ole, was magnificent, and the island scenes were spectacular. The race scene at the end was good, too. However, I don't like the fact that Alec's father died, when in the books, he's alive throught the entire series. Alec was also a little bit older in the original story, which would have made some parts of this film a little more effective.In the scene were Alec and the Black are rescued from the island, there's some things in this segment that that don't make sense unless you read the book. For example, when the Black is being hauled up in the sling, it's kind of bizarre that a wild stallion submits willingly to being lifted up out of the water by a band around his stomach - he literally just dangles there, to the point where it doesn't seem either real or believeable. In the book, he puts up quite a fight. And the boat doesn't look very big -- how do they make room for the Black if the boat wasn't intended for carrying livestock? Also, how does Alec manage to get through customs with the Black when he has no way to prove ownership? The scenes simply cut from the Black being hoisted up on the ship to Alec's homecoming.Notice, too, that Alec's mother immediately lets Alec keep the Black in their backyard, without any discussion of how they're going to be able to care for him. A horse is not like a dog or cat -- they're expensive animals to care for, and a decision to keep one shouldn't be taken lightly.I would call this an OK film, but not one that I'm terribly excited to see again.

Frederick,"[2, 2]","So runs the great, symbolic--even prophetic--advice, albeit incidentally given by a father to his son, shortly before the father's unexpected death, in the form of a story about Alexander the Great.The son is a 10 year old boy who will go on to tame a wild horse after both boy and horse become castaways together on a deserted island.Though with very little dialogue, these first 45 minutes of the film are simply awesome; they set a precedent which is very hard to follow.  In short: the son lives up to his father's advice while on the island, with the result of even saving the life both of himself and of the horse; along the way, giving his all, the boy also realizes a union with nature which can perhaps and might best be described as creation--or at least the horse--becoming the boy's surrogate father. Or rather, the horse becomes both mother and father--as the boy struggles to ""come of age""--for the boy is separated from both parents and can't quite be sure of the fate of either (and frightfully, of himself).  The boy and the horse form a deep, irreplaceable bond.  The methods the boy adopts to tame and ride the wild and unruly horse, are gentle, ingenious, beautiful, and frankly, believable.  His first ride is a cinematic depiction of what psychologist Abraham Maslow called, a 'peak experience.'The recurring combination of believability and beauty makes the film very moving.  It is helpful, but not necessary, to know at least something about horses--how they can be trained without the use of tack, for example--or how horses hate snakes.  No doubt there were those involved in making the film who knew horses very well.  The special delight here is to see what happens between the boy and horse when finally, for the first time, alone, for the boy's initial encounter with the wild horse, while on the ship, was interrupted by the horse's captors--and was limited by all the expected constraints of a playful boy exploring (and bumping into) civilization--as well as, particularly, of a wild, uncontrollable and powerful horse resisting its captors on the confines of a ship at sea.Upon his rescue and return to civilization, the boy soon realizes that this ""ownership"" he attained of the horse while on the island is called into question--as are his somewhat asocial coping skills he developed while living on the island.  The boy thus shifts his attention to finding the place of the horse in the world and thus his own place at the same time.  This takes the form of training the horse as a racehorse--and himself as a jockey--with the help of a new found friend.  What eventually happens offers explanation as to why those people on the ship were taking such trouble to transport the unruly horse in the first place.Great supporting performances by Teri Garr as the boy's mother, and a crusty Mickey Rooney as the new found friend.The transition from the island to civilization is a bit jolting to the audience; at moments it even feels like a different film; but it is done with suitable humor, and merely replicates in the audience the same experience as the boy.In the end, the boy succeeds in being ""alone"" with his horse while being ""in civilization"" at the same time.  The film comes full circle; the closing credits have some of the most beautiful scenes in the movie.A very inspiring, very moving and very beautiful film.  A must see for anyone who likes horses, nature--or even people; about as close to a religious experience you can expect from a movie...at least for a movie that is not religious...",5,"'if you can ride that horse, you can have that horse'",1205107200,"03 10, 2008",2008,3541,"['So', 'great', 'symbolic', 'even', 'prophetic', 'advice', 'incidentally', 'given', 'father', 'son', 'shortly', 'father', 'unexpected', 'death', 'form', 'story', 'Alexander', 'Great.The', 'son', '10', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'will', 'go', 'tame', 'wild', 'horse', 'boy', 'horse', 'become', 'together', 'deserted', 'island.Though', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'simply', 'awesome', 'set', 'precedent', 'very', 'hard', 'follow', 'short', 'son', 'up', 'father', 'advice', 'island', 'result', 'even', 'saving', 'life', 'horse', 'way', 'giving', 'boy', 'also', 'union', 'nature', 'can', 'perhaps', 'might', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'creation', 'least', 'horse', 'becoming', 'boy', 'surrogate', 'father', 'rather', 'horse', 'mother', 'father', 'boy', 'come', 'age', 'boy', 'separated', 'parents', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'be', 'sure', 'fate', 'frightfully', 'boy', 'horse', 'form', 'deep', 'irreplaceable', 'bond', 'methods', 'boy', 'tame', 'ride', 'wild', 'unruly', 'horse', 'are', 'gentle', 'ingenious', 'beautiful', 'frankly', 'believable', 'first', 'ride', 'cinematic', 'depiction', 'what', 'psychologist', 'Abraham', 'Maslow', 'called', ""'peak"", 'experience', ""'The"", 'recurring', 'combination', 'believability', 'beauty', 'film', 'very', 'moving', 'helpful', 'not', 'necessary', 'know', 'least', 'something', 'horses', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'trained', 'use', 'tack', 'example', 'how', 'horses', 'hate', 'snakes', 'doubt', 'were', 'involved', 'making', 'film', 'who', 'knew', 'horses', 'very', 'well', 'special', 'delight', 'here', 'see', 'what', 'boy', 'horse', 'when', 'finally', 'first', 'time', 'alone', 'boy', 'initial', 'encounter', 'wild', 'horse', 'ship', 'was', 'interrupted', 'horse', 'captors', 'was', 'limited', 'expected', 'constraints', 'playful', 'boy', 'exploring', 'bumping', 'civilization', 'as', 'well', 'particularly', 'wild', 'uncontrollable', 'powerful', 'horse', 'resisting', 'captors', 'confines', 'ship', 'rescue', 'return', 'civilization', 'boy', 'soon', 'ownership', 'attained', 'horse', 'island', 'called', 'question', 'are', 'somewhat', 'asocial', 'coping', 'skills', 'developed', 'living', 'island', 'boy', 'thus', 'shifts', 'attention', 'finding', 'place', 'horse', 'world', 'thus', 'own', 'place', 'same', 'time', 'form', 'training', 'horse', 'racehorse', 'jockey', 'help', 'new', 'found', 'friend', 'What', 'eventually', 'offers', 'explanation', 'why', 'people', 'ship', 'were', 'taking', 'such', 'trouble', 'transport', 'unruly', 'horse', 'first', 'place.Great', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'boy', 'mother', 'crusty', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'new', 'found', 'friend.The', 'transition', 'island', 'civilization', 'bit', 'jolting', 'audience', 'moments', 'even', 'different', 'film', 'done', 'suitable', 'humor', 'merely', 'replicates', 'audience', 'same', 'experience', 'boy.In', 'end', 'boy', 'being', 'alone', 'horse', 'being', 'civilization', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'full', 'circle', 'closing', 'credits', 'have', 'most', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'movie.A', 'very', 'inspiring', 'very', 'moving', 'very', 'beautiful', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'who', 'horses', 'nature', 'even', 'people', 'about', 'close', 'religious', 'experience', 'can', 'expect', 'movie', 'least', 'movie', 'not', 'religious']",N/A

Of course this time around I was struck by the scene where young Alec (Kelly Reno) asks old Henry Dailey (Mickey Rooney) if there are any jockeys good enough to ride the Black (Cass-Ole), and he tells the boy about George Woolf, ""The Ice Man.""  I am sure everybody who has seen ""Seabiscuit,"" a strong possibility since we are talking about another great movie about a horse, made the same connection and looked at the match race that the Mystery Horse is added to at the end of this 1979 film in a different light.  I was also struck by the irony that Mickey Rooney, who was always the perfect size for a jockey, is in two of the greatest horse movies of all time (the other being ""National Velvet"" if for some reason you need to be told that bit of cinematic history), and in both he watches some kids ride to glory.  Rooney was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for this role and no doubt his performance jogged the memory of the Academy enough that three years later he was given his honorary Oscar for his lifetime achievement in films.Alce is traveling on a ship with his father (Hoyt Axton) and the wide-eyed boy tacks in the exotic passengers, the high-stakes poker game his father spends all his time playing, and, most of all, the wild and beautiful black horse in the cargo hold.  The boy has been sneaking the horse sugar cubes and when the ship is sunk by a storm, the horse rescues Alex and the two end up on lonely beach.  There Alex, with all the time in the world, tames the horse and rides him up and down the shore, his arms flung wild in the joy of racing throw the sand and water.  When the boy and his black stallion are rescued, they return home, and Alec meet Henry, a former trainer, who soon realizes what the boy already knows.  This horse is something special and so is this movie.Most every one agrees that this is a beautiful film, and a lot of the credit goes to director Carroll Ballard (who also made ""Fly Away Home"") and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel (who, surprisingly, was not nominated for an Oscar for his work here but has been since then for ""The Right Stuff,"" ""The Natural,"" ""Fly Away Home,"" and ""The Patriot"").  But I have to wonder how much of the credit also goes to Melissa Mathison & Jeanne Rosenberg and William D. Wittliff (I love how they do writing credits in films) who adapted Walter Farley's novel.  Maybe they are not the ones who stripped a lot of the dialogue away, but whoever did contributed to the powerful effect this film has on viewers because there are so many key scenes where you do not have to listen to words and can just let your eyes feast on the images.  The boy racing his horse along the shore, watching the starting point on the race track at night in the rain why waiting for the Black to complete a lap, and, of course, the big match race at the end, where thundering down the home stretch the boy, the horse, and the viewer are literally transported back to the beach where they became one.My pet theory remains, that most people truly fall in love with one horse in their lifetime.

135658,AQDI602797FSF,0792833759,Maigray,"[58, 61]","It is with great pleasure I can tell you that I have sat through nearly every horse movie ever made - and that ""The Black Stallion"" is still the best one I have ever seen.Every aspect of the film is superlative; the casting, the acting, the adaptation to screenplay, the music, the sounds, the editing, the characterization and most especially, the cinematography.  But the real genius of the film lies in director Carroll Ballard's exquisite ability to render his main character, namely the black stallion himself, on the screen.Since I have experience with horses I am obviously very aware of how films use their equine actors.  Errors are immediately apparent.  This film does not have any.  Every time a horse is onscreen, characterization in action and expression is perfect.Credit, of course, goes to trainer Corky Randall, and also to the decision to cast Kelly Reno and Mickey Rooney, horsemen themselves, into the human roles.Tremendous credit also goes out to the filmmakers for making the effort to secure animals who would fit the role so well - actual black arabian stallions.  Most would not have gone to the trouble, preferring to work with geldings, or with any breed of horse with the necessary color and training to make the role.  Just look to other notable horse films, like Black Beauty, The Horse Whisperer and SeaBiscuit, to see how the horse is changed to fit the film.One of the best examples of the film's genius with the horses is the scene in which Alec and ""The Black"" first become friends.  The film shows the stallion who played that portion of the scene retreating each time the boy walks toward him, then advancing each time he walks away.  By degrees of advance and retreat is Alec finally able to get close to the horse.Such behavior mimics a horse's natural response perfectly.  But it is not simply how it was it was choreographed; it is how the horse plays the part.  The animal does not tamely walk forward and backwards -  he displays a spirit and impatience of a gorgeously trained animal being put through a difficult series of steps; obedient but with powerful character.  On film, this highly charged personality mimics perfectly the anxiety and anger of a wild stallion trying to cope with coming close to a being he regards with suspicion.Trivia for those interested; Cass-Ole, the stallion to whom lead credit was given, actually had 4 white socks and the star.  In the close shots, you can see the white under the makeup.  It was Cass Ole and Kelly Reno who did most actual scenes, such as galloping without bridle and saddle down the beach.  Most films use doubles for such scenes.Fae-Jur, the main double, was also a black stallion; it is rumored he was not even a true black, but a grey who had to be dyed extensively to play the role.  He is said to have done many of the ""wild"" scenes, when no rider was required.The film gets my highest recommendation for both adults and children.  Some may be frustrated by the artistic slant of the story - it rolls past like a dream, especially the island sequences.  Children who have read the book may be disappointed by any changes they perceive in the story.  But the film is a a masterpiece of storytelling - for children or otherwise.",5,The Best Horse Movie Ever Made,1081209600,"04 6, 2004",2004,3231,"['great', 'pleasure', 'can', 'tell', 'have', 'sat', 'nearly', 'horse', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'still', 'best', 'one', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.Every', 'aspect', 'film', 'superlative', 'casting', 'acting', 'adaptation', 'screenplay', 'music', 'sounds', 'editing', 'characterization', 'most', 'especially', 'cinematography', 'real', 'genius', 'film', 'director', 'Carroll', 'Ballard', 'exquisite', 'ability', 'render', 'main', 'character', 'namely', 'black', 'stallion', 'screen.Since', 'have', 'experience', 'horses', 'am', 'obviously', 'very', 'aware', 'how', 'films', 'use', 'equine', 'actors', 'Errors', 'are', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'Every', 'time', 'horse', 'onscreen', 'characterization', 'action', 'expression', 'perfect.Credit', 'course', 'trainer', 'Corky', 'Randall', 'also', 'decision', 'cast', 'Kelly', 'Reno', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'horsemen', 'human', 'roles.Tremendous', 'credit', 'also', 'out', 'filmmakers', 'making', 'effort', 'secure', 'animals', 'who', 'would', 'fit', 'role', 'so', 'well', 'actual', 'black', 'arabian', 'stallions', 'Most', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'gone', 'trouble', 'preferring', 'work', 'geldings', 'breed', 'horse', 'necessary', 'color', 'training', 'make', 'role', 'Just', 'look', 'other', 'notable', 'horse', 'films', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'Horse', 'Whisperer', 'SeaBiscuit', 'see', 'how', 'horse', 'changed', 'fit', 'film.One', 'best', 'examples', 'film', 'genius', 'horses', 'scene', 'Alec', 'Black', 'first', 'become', 'friends', 'film', 'stallion', 'who', 'played', 'portion', 'scene', 'retreating', 'time', 'boy', 'walks', 'then', 'advancing', 'time', 'away', 'degrees', 'advance', 'retreat', 'Alec', 'finally', 'able', 'get', 'close', 'horse.Such', 'behavior', 'mimics', 'horse', 'natural', 'response', 'perfectly', 'not', 'simply', 'how', 'was', 'was', 'choreographed', 'how', 'horse', 'part', 'animal', 'not', 'tamely', 'walk', 'forward', 'backwards', 'spirit', 'impatience', 'gorgeously', 'trained', 'animal', 'being', 'put', 'difficult', 'series', 'steps', 'obedient', 'powerful', 'character', 'film', 'highly', 'charged', 'personality', 'mimics', 'perfectly', 'anxiety', 'anger', 'wild', 'stallion', 'trying', 'cope', 'coming', 'close', 'being', 'suspicion.Trivia', 'interested', 'Cass-Ole', 'stallion', 'whom', 'lead', 'credit', 'was', 'given', 'actually', 'had', '4', 'white', 'socks', 'star', 'close', 'shots', 'can', 'see', 'white', 'makeup', 'was', 'Cass', 'Ole', 'Kelly', 'Reno', 'who', 'did', 'most', 'actual', 'scenes', 'such', 'galloping', 'bridle', 'saddle', 'down', 'beach', 'Most', 'films', 'use', 'doubles', 'such', 'scenes.Fae-Jur', 'main', 'double', 'was', 'also', 'black', 'stallion', 'rumored', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'true', 'black', 'grey', 'who', 'had', 'be', 'dyed', 'extensively', 'play', 'role', 'said', 'have', 'done', 'many', 'wild', 'scenes', 'when', 'rider', 'was', 'required.The', 'film', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'adults', 'children', 'may', 'be', 'frustrated', 'artistic', 'slant', 'story', 'dream', 'especially', 'island', 'sequences', 'Children', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'changes', 'perceive', 'story', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'storytelling', 'children', 'otherwise']",N/A

I was afraid to see this movie when it came out for fear that it would defile those memories.Years later I bought the DVD for my son to watch. The first viewing left me a little cold, I have to admit, even though I loved the look of the film and the development of the relationship between the shipwrecked boy, Alec Ramsey, and the gorgeous Arabian horse, ""The Black."" The basic elements of the book were there: A shipwrecked boy and wild horse land on a desert island. The boy figures out how to survive and gather food for the horse and himself, and the wild horse learns to trust Alec. The boy and horse are rescued. The boy and a trainer get the horse ready for a match race against two of the greatest horses of the day. But otherwise the film seemed to deviate a great deal: In the book, Alec is a teenager rather than a young boy, Alec's father is not lost in the shipwreck, the episode where The Black escapes and runs through town wreaking havoc does not occur, and the trainer, Henry, does not have a dark back story. Those are just some examples.So I went back and read Walter Farley's novel, hoping that I would enjoy it as much as I still enjoy some books I loved as a child, like the ""Little House"" series and ""Charlotte's Web."" Farley wrote ""The Black Stallion"" while still an undergraduate at Columbia so he should be cut some slack, but the gosh-bang-gee-whiz writing style and clunky dialogue were painful. The book struck me as plain ridiculous--and I still read a lot of horse books so it's not like I've outgrown the subject matter.Reading the book again vastly improved my appreciation for the movie--they made art out of hack writing. I still like the first part of the movie better than the second half, because the second half is beyond my capacity to suspend my disbelief. But it's a beautiful film, one you can watch repeatedly, like listening to a favorite album.Parent warning: The shipwreck scene may frighten younger children.",4,Lovely Horse Story--Much Better Than the Book,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,2056,"['many', 'viewers', 'read', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'books', 'over', 'girl', 'loved', 'most', 'was', 'afraid', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'fear', 'would', 'defile', 'memories.Years', 'later', 'bought', 'DVD', 'son', 'watch', 'first', 'viewing', 'left', 'little', 'cold', 'have', 'admit', 'even', 'loved', 'look', 'film', 'development', 'relationship', 'shipwrecked', 'boy', 'Alec', 'Ramsey', 'gorgeous', 'Arabian', 'horse', 'Black', 'basic', 'elements', 'book', 'were', 'there', 'shipwrecked', 'boy', 'wild', 'horse', 'land', 'desert', 'island', 'boy', 'out', 'how', 'survive', 'gather', 'food', 'horse', 'wild', 'horse', 'learns', 'trust', 'Alec', 'boy', 'horse', 'are', 'rescued', 'boy', 'trainer', 'get', 'horse', 'ready', 'match', 'race', 'two', 'greatest', 'horses', 'day', 'otherwise', 'film', 'seemed', 'deviate', 'great', 'deal', 'book', 'Alec', 'teenager', 'rather', 'young', 'boy', 'Alec', 'father', 'not', 'lost', 'shipwreck', 'episode', 'where', 'Black', 'escapes', 'town', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'not', 'occur', 'trainer', 'Henry', 'not', 'have', 'dark', 'back', 'story', 'are', 'just', 'examples.So', 'went', 'back', 'read', 'Walter', 'Farley', 'novel', 'hoping', 'would', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'still', 'enjoy', 'books', 'loved', 'child', 'Little', 'House', 'series', 'Charlotte', 'Web', 'Farley', 'wrote', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'still', 'undergraduate', 'Columbia', 'should', 'be', 'cut', 'slack', 'gosh-bang-gee-whiz', 'writing', 'style', 'clunky', 'dialogue', 'were', 'painful', 'book', 'struck', 'plain', 'ridiculous', 'still', 'read', 'lot', 'horse', 'books', 'not', ""'ve"", 'outgrown', 'subject', 'matter.Reading', 'book', 'again', 'vastly', 'improved', 'appreciation', 'movie', 'made', 'art', 'hack', 'writing', 'still', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'better', 'second', 'half', 'second', 'half', 'capacity', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'beautiful', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'listening', 'favorite', 'album.Parent', 'warning', 'shipwreck', 'scene', 'may', 'frighten', 'younger', 'children']",N/A

I bought the DVD when it first came out, and was so disappointed by the poor picture quality.  The film is so beautifully photographed and the DVD release just was not up to snuff.  I was VERY unhappy.  But because it was the only way to get a copy of the film for the longest time, I just accepted the fact that this was as good as it was going to get.  So when I saw a blu-ray disc of the film being offered on Amazon, I immediately decided to buy it.  I'm not sorry that I did!  Finally, a disc that does justice to the glorious cinematography.

135667,A3RINLIDX74QLP,0792833759,"Monika ""equestrienne_23""","[7, 8]","The story of ""The Black Stallion"" first appeared in 1941, the first of a series by Walter Farley, and has become a staple in children's literature. In 1979 the classic book was adapted to the screen and since then the movie has endeared itself to the hearts of horse lovers almost as much as the book. It tells the story of Alec Ramsay (Kelly Reno) and his partnership with a remarkable horse, referred to only as the Black. While returning from a trip to India, Alec's ship is wrecked in a storm, leaving he and the Black as the only survivors, washed up on a small, deserted island. The two must struggle to survive on the barren island, and during this time Alec takes it upon himself to win the trust of the wild stallion. As the days pass, a strong bond is formed between boy and horse.At last the two are rescued, and the story takes a different turn. Back home, Alec teams up with former racehorse trainer Henry Dailey (Mickey Rooney), who recognizes the Black's potential for speed and agrees to help train him in hopes of eventually racing him. But the Black has no registration papers, and is therefore not eligible to enter official races. Nevertheless, boy and man refuse to give up and Dailey comes up with a plan. At this time the racing world is abuzz about an upcoming match race between two champions, each touted as the best in the country, but who have never run against each other. If Dailey can convince the owners of these horses to allow the Black to run in the match, then perhaps the Black will have his chance to prove himself.Though the movie is good, it does not live up to the book. The backbone of the story is still there, but some inexplicable plot changes were made that neither improve the story nor aid its adaptation to film. Perhaps most obvious is the fact that the Alec of the movie is much younger than the Alec of the book. Child actor Kelly Reno was 13 when he played the roll, but looks even younger. We are not given a specific age for the movie Alec, which leaves the impression that he's probably in his latter years of elementary school. The Alec of the book was supposed to be in high school. The other major change is the fact that, in the movie, Alec's father is killed in the shipwreck. In the book, Alec was traveling alone and both his parents are there to greet him when he gets home.The other changes are more minor. The knife Alec receives from his father before the shipwreck was, in the book, a gift from his uncle in India. The Bucephalus figure did not exist at all. The movie introduces us to Henry Dailey by making him look like a would-be thief when he captures and hides the Black after the horse escapes from Alec's yard. In the book Alec was already acquainted with the Daileys and approaches them himself, asking to stable the Black in their barn. The movie also fails to convey a true sense of the story's timeline. Alec and the Black were trapped on the island for 19 days, but in the movie it seems less than a week. We don't see much of the struggle against starvation preceding their rescue. Also, in the book, Alec and Henry spend months preparing the Black to race, but the movie makes the process appear much more accelerated.Nevertheless, taken as a movie in itself, ""The Black Stallion"" is a success. The story, albeit changed, is a good one, and is conveyed very well. The cinematography is beautiful, and the sequence on the island is absolutely breathtaking. With very little dialogue in this early part of the film, we are left to concentrate on the physical beauty of the Black and the dance of wills between the two as their relationship develops and grows. The Black, played by Arabian stallion Cass Ole, is one of the most charismatic equine characters ever to grace the screen. His interactions with Alec on the island are mesmerizing. The only part of the film that really equals this early sequence in its captivation of the viewer is the thrilling race scene at the end.The human casting decisions were also well made. Despite the incongruity in Alec's age from book to movie, for the sake of the movie Kelly Reno was an excellent choice. Reno was chosen largely for his riding ability, having been around horses from a young age. It is not often that you find a child who can ride a stallion bareback at top speed and look entirely at ease. I do wish that they'd dyed his hair red, to match the book Alec, but this is a minor quibble. Mickey Rooney, also a horseman, does an admirable job as Dailey. The scenes in which he coaches Alec on riding feel particularly genuine and are very satisfying to watch. The entire supporting cast comes through as well, and I cannot think of a single weak spot.The DVD itself is minorly disappointing. The only ""Special Feature"" is the theatrical trailer, nothing else. The paper insert does provide a little background on the production, but I would much rather have seen a featurette on the process. I'm sure even after all these years they could have dug up enough material to put together a nice ""making-of"" bit. I hope that someday a special edition might be released with such a feature included. In the mean time, if you're interested in learning more, there is plenty of information to be had at the Black Stallion website ([...] which covers all the books and each of the movies based on them. Overall, I'd still recommend purchasing ""The Black Stallion"" as an addition to your DVD collection, as it's a very good film for any horse lover, child or adult.",4,Decent adaptation of Farley's

135681,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,0792833759,Ranny Levy,"[1, 1]","This film is very appealing to the eye, inspirational, and touching. Alec Ramsey (Kelly Reno) is on a ship with his father and a very wild black Arabian stallion, which Alec calls Black. A terrible storm happens and only he and Black survive. They end up on a small island and Alec befriends Black. Some travelers stumble across the island and bring them to England, where retired horse trainer, Henry Dailey (Mickey Rooney) helps Alec train Black.I like this film because of the cinematography and the plot. This is a beautiful story and there are a lot of scenes with great angles and close ups which catch my eye.  Black is a very pretty, strong and fast horse. The acting is very believable and I can sometimes feel their emotions. My favorite character is Alex because he is able to earn the trust of Black and this is very hard to do.My favorite scene is when Alec is tries to get Black to like him so he gives him some food and after that he puts some food in his hand and then walks around the beach of the island to get the horse to follow him.  After a while this turns into a game.  If Black follows Alec then he will get some food.Carroll Ballard directs ""The Black Stallion"" while Melissa Mathison along with Jeanne Rosenberg writes the screen play.  Other actors in this film are Clarence Muse (Snoe), Hoyt Axton (Alec's Father), and Ed McNamara (Jake).  A message in this film is that you can become friends with any person or any animal and it doesn't matter if you're young or old.  Also, everything that happens, happens for a reason.I recommend, ""The Black Stallion"" for ages 7 to 14. Younger ages may be scared at some of the scenes, but if they are watching with this family, it may not be too scary. Of course, if you are a horse lover, this film is for you and you can add this to your collection. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars. Some of the scenes are a little too short and has too little details, but even with that, this is still a great family film.

Alec dubs him The Black (played by Cass Ol&eacute;, a former champion show horse) and gradually wins the horse's trust, forging a relationship that will affect both of them forever. When Alec and The Black are finally rescued and go home together, they meet ex-jockey Henry Dailey (Mickey Rooney), who is convinced the pair should race. With the help of Henry and his aged white gelding, Napoleon (played by Junior, who had previously starred in National Lampoon's Animal House as Trooper, Niedermeyer's ill-fated horse), their training lands them in the winner's circle.

135689,A1LTJCQGRPTOTD,0792833759,STEPHEN T. McCARTHY,"[1, 3]","You don't want to miss out on this wonderful family film about a boy and his dog. The fact that Caleb Deschanel was not even nominated - huh? - a horse? Oh, yes, of course! A horse. A wonderful family film about a boy and his horse.The fact that Caleb Deschanel was not even nominated for an Oscar for his extraordinary cinematography in THE BLACK STALLION goes to prove what a dog and pony show the Academy Award presentations really are. (Dang! How'd that little dog sneak back in here again?) Deschanel's poetic work in this film belongs in an elite class which also includes KOYAANISQATSI and ONE FROM THE HEART.Kelly Reno's work also belongs in an elite class of highly developed performances by child actors, which also includes Bobs Watson in ON BORROWED TIME, and Haley Joel Osment in THE SIXTH SENSE.But what I really want to focus on with this review is something that only my fellow reviewer Candace Scott seemed to fully appreciate and noted in her July 3, 2003 assessment: I was fortunate enough to have been given the opportunity to do a little (VERY little) professional acting in the late l970s and early '80s. It was a craft that I took very seriously and studied for many years. Having learned a bit about it, I wish to say that MICKEY ROONEY's naturalistic performance in this movie is one of the finest ever filmed! I watch THE BLACK STALLION every couple of years and end up slack-jawed every time!In acting there is something known as ""False Notes"", and these occur when a performer falls out of character and/or plays to the camera or audience. Even the greatest of thespians are guilty of committing False Notes in every performance. MICKEY's performance as horse trainer Henry Dailey may be the only PERFECT performance I have ever seen. Does it seem like he just isn't doing much? Does it seem like he's hardly even acting? EXACTLY!!! The viewer simply can't catch him ""acting"", and that's the whole point! His actions, his reactions, and his speech patterns are so organic to the character he's playing that he really ISN'T acting - he's BEING!  He's Henry Dailey IN THE MOMENT!  He may have played a False Note for a brief moment in the scene where he reassures Alec who sits on the car bumper in the rain-soaked night. Maybe. MAYBE! It's arguable. I've seen many an extraordinary performance in my (nearly) 45 years, but this one is really something special. There are many excellent reasons to see this film, but Mickey is the best of them. At least for me.I suppose I should mention the movie's one notable flaw even though it is of such little consequence: The editing in the horse race always disturbs me a little. As they cut from the long establishing shot to the thundering hooves, and then back to the long shot, it leaves the false impression that The Black's position changes in the field of horses a few times.  (As if he's closed on the leader, and then fallen back again.) But c'mon, are we gonna let a little detail like that spoil such an overall artistic success for us? No way!

135695,A1ZET26EBTHA0X,0792833759,Vidiwell100,"[1, 1]","I remember this movie fondly from my childhood. Even if you're not a big fan of horses, you'll love this movie. It's one of those movies that you keep hoping will show one day on channels like AMC or TMC, but it never does, and you wonder why. Because the movie is well done, well acted and has so many interesting levels. It covers a father and son's close relationship and then the tragic loss of it, Alec's bond with The Black when Alec needed a friend the most, and making Alec's father's story of Alexander's horse truly come to life, as well as giving a forgotten trainer back the passion of his past career. The story is minimalistic as is the dialog, which sets a wondrous, slightly mystical-like mood of the film, from the beginning on the ship as Alec snoops around giving The Black sugar cubes (hilarious when The Black's mouth pops out from the port hole and vacuums them up ), when Alec and The Black learn to trust each other on the desolate island they are marooned on together to the end when the two round the track to close in on the other jockeys. This movie is a true gem in the history of films based around horses and horse racing and is a perfect film for the whole family, so children can watch it and you don't have to worry, for fear of profanity and bad behavior. Terri Garr is sort of a set piece in this and doesn't have many lines to express her feelings having thought that her son was dead, but she does well with what she's given. Mickey Rooney, being in real life from around the era (1946) in which this period piece is set, does great in playing the ""rough around the edges"" gentle former winning trainer, and Kelly Reno does a very good job, as the central Human character here who gets a lot of face time. Hoyt Axton (the father from Gremlins) as Alec's father does a great job too and is noticeably gone too soon. Strangely, this movie seems to have disappeared into a bit of obscurity, and isn't heralded these days with the likes of Black Beauty, Seabiscuit, Flicka etc. I could only find this DVD online. I haven't seen ""The Black Stallion Returns"" in a while and don't remember is it is as good as this, but I plan on buying it also.",5,"Even if you don't love horses, you'll love the movie.",1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,2176,"['remember', 'movie', 'fondly', 'childhood', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'horses', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie', 'one', 'movies', 'keep', 'hoping', 'will', 'show', 'one', 'day', 'channels', 'AMC', 'TMC', 'never', 'wonder', 'why', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'acted', 'so', 'many', 'interesting', 'levels', 'father', 'son', 'close', 'relationship', 'then', 'tragic', 'loss', 'Alec', 'bond', 'Black', 'when', 'Alec', 'needed', 'friend', 'most', 'making', 'Alec', 'father', 'story', 'Alexander', 'horse', 'truly', 'come', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'forgotten', 'trainer', 'back', 'passion', 'past', 'career', 'story', 'minimalistic', 'dialog', 'wondrous', 'slightly', 'mystical-like', 'mood', 'film', 'beginning', 'ship', 'Alec', 'snoops', 'giving', 'Black', 'sugar', 'cubes', 'hilarious', 'when', 'Black', 'mouth', 'out', 'port', 'hole', 'vacuums', 'up', 'when', 'Alec', 'Black', 'learn', 'trust', 'other', 'desolate', 'island', 'are', 'marooned', 'together', 'end', 'when', 'two', 'round', 'track', 'close', 'other', 'jockeys', 'movie', 'true', 'gem', 'history', 'films', 'based', 'horses', 'horse', 'racing', 'perfect', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'children', 'can', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'fear', 'profanity', 'bad', 'behavior', 'Terri', 'Garr', 'sort', 'set', 'piece', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'lines', 'express', 'feelings', 'having', 'thought', 'son', 'was', 'dead', 'well', 'what', 'given', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'being', 'real', 'life', 'era', '1946', 'period', 'piece', 'set', 'great', 'playing', 'rough', 'edges', 'gentle', 'former', 'winning', 'trainer', 'Kelly', 'Reno', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'central', 'Human', 'character', 'here', 'who', 'lot', 'face', 'time', 'Hoyt', 'Axton', 'father', 'Gremlins', 'Alec', 'father', 'great', 'job', 'too', 'noticeably', 'gone', 'too', 'soon', 'Strangely', 'movie', 'have', 'disappeared', 'bit', 'obscurity', ""n't"", 'heralded', 'days', 'likes', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'Seabiscuit', 'Flicka', 'etc', 'could', 'only', 'find', 'DVD', 'online', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'Returns', 'while', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'as', 'good', 'plan', 'buying', 'also']",N/A
135696,A1C80B497LCYKA,0792833759,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[3, 3]","There is no film more perfectly innocent or pure than this film. There is nothing offensive or defiling about it. It is almost like visiting Eden, and is, in my opinion, what every film should be.In spite of these remarkable qualities, there are other things about this film that are equally remarkable. For example, the horse that played the Black Stallion - Cass Ole - wasn't really black, and had to go through makeup each day. Kelly Reno, who plays Alec Ramsey, the boy the Black saves, and who rides him to fame and glory, had never acted before and does his own stunts. Corky Randall, the horse's trainer, was the son of Glenn Randall, Sr., who trained the horses for Ben-Hur. Carroll Ballard, director for the film, had never directed a feature film before, but was a talented cinematographer. His other best known film is Never Cry Wolf (1983).This is one of Mickey Rooney's best performances as the ex-jockey who trains Alec to race, and he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Thirty-four years earlier, he trained Elizabeth Taylor's character, Velvet, to ride in National Velvet - also one of his most memorable performances. Teri Garr is good as Mrs. Ramsey, Alec's mother; and Clarence Muse is wonderful as Snoe, an old black man who befriends Alec and advises him to keep the Black wild. Of course, he doesn't, and, because of it, we're treated to one of the best racing scenes in film history.The wedding of visuals and music make this one of the most beautiful films ever made, with Caleb Deschanel taking credit for the photography, for which he was nominated for various awards and won both the LA Film Critics and National Film Critics Awards. There is just enough dialogue to move the story along; but most of it is told through the gorgeous visuals. A stirring original music score by Carmine Coppola supports the cinematography perfectly, for which she, too, was nominated for various awards, including Golden Globe, and won the LA Film Critics Award. Robert Dalva was nominated for the Oscar for Best Film Editing. Francis Ford Coppola (Godfather) was executive producer.For story and acting, National Velvet is probably the best horse movie ever made. But this is the most beautiful. It is pure beauty, as idyllic and innocent as the island on which the Black and Alec form their relationship. It is the kind of movie that makes you wish you were Alec, racing along the shore with his arms in the air, as free as a bird, on the back of his best friend, the most beautiful stallion in the world. That is what it's like to be totally alive.Waitsel Smith",5,"MOST BEAUTIFUL OF HORSE MOVIES - PURE, IDYLLIC, INNOCENT",1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,2592,"['film', 'more', 'perfectly', 'innocent', 'pure', 'film', 'nothing', 'offensive', 'defiling', 'almost', 'visiting', 'Eden', 'opinion', 'what', 'film', 'should', 'be.In', 'spite', 'remarkable', 'qualities', 'are', 'other', 'things', 'film', 'are', 'equally', 'remarkable', 'example', 'horse', 'played', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'Cass', 'Ole', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'black', 'had', 'go', 'makeup', 'day', 'Kelly', 'Reno', 'who', 'Alec', 'Ramsey', 'boy', 'Black', 'saves', 'who', 'fame', 'glory', 'had', 'never', 'acted', 'own', 'stunts', 'Corky', 'Randall', 'horse', 'trainer', 'was', 'son', 'Glenn', 'Randall', 'Sr.', 'who', 'trained', 'horses', 'Ben-Hur', 'Carroll', 'Ballard', 'director', 'film', 'had', 'never', 'directed', 'feature', 'film', 'was', 'talented', 'cinematographer', 'other', 'best', 'known', 'film', 'Never', 'Cry', 'Wolf', '1983', '.This', 'one', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'best', 'performances', 'ex-jockey', 'who', 'Alec', 'race', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Thirty-four', 'years', 'earlier', 'trained', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'character', 'Velvet', 'ride', 'National', 'Velvet', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'good', 'Mrs.', 'Ramsey', 'Alec', 'mother', 'Clarence', 'Muse', 'wonderful', 'Snoe', 'old', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'Alec', 'keep', 'Black', 'wild', 'course', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'treated', 'one', 'best', 'racing', 'scenes', 'film', 'history.The', 'wedding', 'visuals', 'music', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Caleb', 'Deschanel', 'taking', 'credit', 'photography', 'was', 'nominated', 'various', 'awards', 'won', 'LA', 'Film', 'Critics', 'National', 'Film', 'Critics', 'Awards', 'just', 'enough', 'dialogue', 'move', 'story', 'most', 'told', 'gorgeous', 'visuals', 'stirring', 'original', 'music', 'score', 'Carmine', 'Coppola', 'cinematography', 'perfectly', 'too', 'was', 'nominated', 'various', 'awards', 'including', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'won', 'LA', 'Film', 'Critics', 'Award', 'Robert', 'Dalva', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Film', 'Editing', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Godfather', 'was', 'executive', 'producer.For', 'story', 'acting', 'National', 'Velvet', 'probably', 'best', 'horse', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'most', 'beautiful', 'pure', 'beauty', 'idyllic', 'innocent', 'island', 'Black', 'Alec', 'form', 'relationship', 'kind', 'movie', 'wish', 'were', 'Alec', 'racing', 'shore', 'arms', 'air', 'as', 'free', 'bird', 'back', 'best', 'friend', 'most', 'beautiful', 'stallion', 'world', 'what', 'be', 'totally', 'alive.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A
