576758,A1GQQFTPA23Z1O,B00005AAF4,Dave,"[57, 59]","I'm so glad this classic is finally getting a dvd release! While it doesn't have the large-scale battle scenes of The Longest Day, it nevertheless remains one of my all-time favorite WW2 films. Jeffrey Hunter gives one of his best performances as George Tweed, a U.S. Navy sailor trapped on the island of Guam after the Japanese invade in Dec. 1941. There are four other sailors with him, but they are killed off one by one until only Tweed is left to fend for himself. That is, until he discovers the friendly natives, who continually risk their lives (& in some cases give their lives)to protect him from the Japanese occupation troops. He is continually on the move, however, because the Japanese are always trying to catch him.

576767,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00005AAF4,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I liked this film, even if it has some weaknesses. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.Two precisions first:- to my best knowledge, this film is available only on Region 1 NTSC DVDs; therefore it will NOT PLAY on European (Region 2) equipment- in the past this film was also known under an alternate title - &#34;Island Escape&#34;This film is based on the true story of a US Navy sailor, George Ray Tweed, who avoided capture when Japanese landed on Guam on 10 December 1941 and thanks to the help of local Chamorro population remained in hiding to 10 July 1944, when he was rescued by an American destroyer. He described his adventures in the book &#34;Robinson Crusoe, USN&#34; (see my rview of it) published in 1945 and this film is based on this account. The story  was however considerably changed:- real George Ray Tweed was already 39 and was married with children in 1941 (his family was evacuated from Guam before Japanese invasion); in this film he is 32, which made it possible to Jeffrey Hunter (36 in 1962, but looking younger) to play him; in the film his family status is also never mentioned and we are left to belief that he is single, which allowed for a kind of romance with a Chamorro girl Josephina Cruz (Barbara Perez, a Philippino actress) - in real life no such thing happened)- a part of the film happens in a leper colony - in reality, to my best knowledge, no such place existed on Guam since XIX century; also, it seems that there is no scorpions on Guam (or at least there wasn't during the WWII - now, with all those invasive species God only knows...)- the importance and especially circulation of &#34;Guam's Eagle&#34;, a clandestine information bulletin Tweed produced and distributed when hiding, was somehow upgraded for the needs of the film- there are also some episodes added to make the story more dramatic and more interesting, one of them including Tweed's &#34;dog tags&#34; - but I cannot give away too much of the plotThe one thing that really hurt a lot of Guam's people about this film, that NOT EVEN ONE real Chamorro ever appears in it - this film was shot on Philippines and actors playing Chamorros are in fact Philippino people. For that reason, Chamorro characters never speak chamorro language - they speak tagalog (main native language of Philippines) instead.Unlike what DVD cover suggests, this film hardly contains any action or fighting scenes - but it doesn't really hurt it, as this is a film about hiding and avoiding capture (followed by torture and certain death), not about fighting.All this being said, this film remains a good watch, an atypical war movie, in which fighting war is a background noise, but all other wartime hardships are very real.&#34;No man is an island' shows very well how much good will and heroism from unarmed and vulnerable civilians it takes to save the life of just one hunted man, when this man is on the run from an occupying force serving a totalitarian, merciless militaristic regime. Not only Chamorros but even some of Japanese American people living on Guam helped Tweed, directly or undirectly and in real life at least three of his helpers died a horriblre screaming death in torture dungeons of Japanese military or Kempeitai, a secret special police which was Japanese equivalent of Gestapo...I liked this film and I will keep my DVD for future viewings.

576773,A1JEFESGLIS076,B00005AAF4,rsoonsa,"[8, 17]","Jeffrey Hunter plays the part of George Tweed, the redoubtable U.S. Navy radioman who survived in hiding on Guam, during the Japanese occupation of that island, with the assistance of many Guamanians who willingly turned their lives upside-down to protect him. Hunter is woefully miscast; devout Antonio Antero, the Chamorro who was Tweed's principal benefactor during his ordeal, was convinced of his Christian duty to assist the American due to the latter's appearance: gaunt and dirty with long hair and sullied clothing, akin to Christ before the crucifixion, but Hunter is obviously well-nourished with his hair style never disturbed, and with barely a nod by his demeanor to his taxing situation. Tweed, as the sole American survivor of the invasion, was a totem to the people native to Guam that the United States was still there, but this fact was overlooked in this production. Although Tweed was hidden within a cave in the island's southeast, a popular tourist attraction today, the scenario places him atop a mountain where he would be in plain view of enemy aircraft, a serious miscue in light of the fact that much of the occupiers' activity was revolving about attempts at his capture. Tweed cleverly repaired a damaged radio and typewriter and through skillful use of both helped to offset Japanese propaganda concerning the true progress of the war; however, this is touched on but briefly and in a distorted fashion, at that. Although obviously designed as packaged Hollywood entertainment, the screen story appears jejune when one recalls that many died to preserve the safety of the real-life Tweed. Filmed in the Philippines with largely local performers, NO MAN IS AN ISLAND flags from consistently poor production characteristics, which tend to jar the viewer's sensibilities. Not surprisingly, the acting is variable, with Marshall Thompson being wasted, and Hunter swallowing many of his lines as well as being uncomfortably saddled with a vapid love interest. Since the script does not delineate a point of view, and there is scant in the way of direction, we are left with one cliche-ridden scene after another. Some potentially engaging sub-plots, in particular one formed from the plight of Japanese-Americans remaining on Guam during the occupation, are only grazed fragments here. Talented Basil Wrangell does his best at editing this affair, but his cachet is finally defeated as the movie flounders forward to its hackneyed conclusion.",2,Second-rate treatment of a noble adventure.,1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,2468,"['Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'part', 'George', 'Tweed', 'redoubtable', 'U.S.', 'Navy', 'radioman', 'who', 'survived', 'hiding', 'Guam', 'Japanese', 'occupation', 'island', 'assistance', 'many', 'Guamanians', 'who', 'willingly', 'turned', 'lives', 'upside-down', 'protect', 'Hunter', 'woefully', 'miscast', 'devout', 'Antonio', 'Antero', 'Chamorro', 'who', 'was', 'Tweed', 'principal', 'benefactor', 'ordeal', 'was', 'convinced', 'Christian', 'duty', 'assist', 'American', 'due', 'latter', 'appearance', 'gaunt', 'dirty', 'long', 'hair', 'sullied', 'clothing', 'akin', 'Christ', 'crucifixion', 'Hunter', 'obviously', 'well-nourished', 'hair', 'style', 'never', 'disturbed', 'barely', 'nod', 'demeanor', 'taxing', 'situation', 'Tweed', 'sole', 'American', 'survivor', 'invasion', 'was', 'totem', 'people', 'native', 'Guam', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'still', 'there', 'fact', 'was', 'overlooked', 'production', 'Tweed', 'was', 'hidden', 'cave', 'island', 'southeast', 'popular', 'tourist', 'attraction', 'today', 'scenario', 'atop', 'mountain', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'plain', 'view', 'enemy', 'aircraft', 'serious', 'miscue', 'light', 'fact', 'much', 'occupiers', 'activity', 'was', 'revolving', 'attempts', 'capture', 'Tweed', 'cleverly', 'repaired', 'damaged', 'radio', 'typewriter', 'skillful', 'use', 'helped', 'offset', 'Japanese', 'propaganda', 'concerning', 'true', 'progress', 'war', 'however', 'touched', 'briefly', 'distorted', 'fashion', 'obviously', 'designed', 'packaged', 'Hollywood', 'entertainment', 'screen', 'story', 'jejune', 'when', 'one', 'many', 'died', 'preserve', 'safety', 'real-life', 'Tweed', 'Filmed', 'Philippines', 'largely', 'local', 'performers', 'NO', 'MAN', 'AN', 'ISLAND', 'flags', 'consistently', 'poor', 'production', 'characteristics', 'tend', 'jar', 'viewer', 'sensibilities', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'acting', 'variable', 'Marshall', 'Thompson', 'being', 'wasted', 'Hunter', 'swallowing', 'many', 'lines', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'uncomfortably', 'saddled', 'vapid', 'love', 'interest', 'script', 'not', 'delineate', 'point', 'view', 'scant', 'way', 'direction', 'are', 'left', 'one', 'cliche-ridden', 'scene', 'potentially', 'engaging', 'sub-plots', 'particular', 'one', 'formed', 'plight', 'Japanese-Americans', 'remaining', 'Guam', 'occupation', 'are', 'only', 'grazed', 'fragments', 'here', 'Talented', 'Basil', 'Wrangell', 'best', 'editing', 'affair', 'cachet', 'finally', 'defeated', 'movie', 'flounders', 'forward', 'hackneyed', 'conclusion']",No Man Is An Island VHS

The film credits at the end of the film said it was filmed in the Philipines, so that probably explains the odd combination of language.
