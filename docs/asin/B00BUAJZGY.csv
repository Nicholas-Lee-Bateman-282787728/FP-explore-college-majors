AT is a one in a million hit thats just so unique. but regular show proves that these days any cartoon on CN can be good with enough effort and you dont have to be the most creative genius to make a good cartoon! ever since more standard like what use to be on CN in the 2000's have been made. sure theres only 4 or 5 good cartoons but only them are aired! plus the next batch of shows look promising(spread the word about lakewood plaza turbo! its a pilot that hasnt been greenlit yet! its so amazing and CN needs to know people want it as a full show like what happened with steven universe and clarence. btw those two shows are confirmed for 2013! but LPT is an 80's style street fighter/dbz comedy/action cartoon! if that sounds awsome but your worried its not good go search the pilot!) anyways more on regular show. it follows a formula but its not reperitive in the least! every episode starts off like any normal day and turns into over the top adventure! and they are all so creative and different! also the characters and voice acting are great! there are so many funny and quotable lines! and im sure this set will fit any collectors needs!,5,CN's comeback show,1373673600,"07 13, 2013",2013,1506,"['regular', 'show', 'just', 'good', 'cartoon', 'whats', 'even', 'more', 'important', 'what', 'did', 'restored', 'faith', 'CN', 'network', 'sure', 'adventure', 'time', 'posterchild', 'CN', 'loved', 'many', 'cool', 'unique', 'show', 'i', 'find', 'episodes', 'boring', 'also', 'songs', 'sung', 'characters', 'can', 'come', 'off', 'cheesy', 'personally', 'i', 'do', 'enjoy', 'songs', 'AT', 'one', 'million', 'hit', 'thats', 'just', 'so', 'unique', 'regular', 'show', 'days', 'cartoon', 'CN', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'effort', 'dont', 'have', 'be', 'most', 'creative', 'genius', 'make', 'good', 'cartoon', 'ever', 'more', 'standard', 'what', 'use', 'be', 'CN', '2000', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'sure', 'only', '4', '5', 'good', 'cartoons', 'only', 'are', 'aired', 'next', 'batch', 'shows', 'look', 'promising', 'spread', 'word', 'lakewood', 'plaza', 'turbo', 'pilot', 'been', 'greenlit', 'yet', 'amazing', 'CN', 'know', 'people', 'want', 'full', 'show', 'what', 'happened', 'steven', 'universe', 'clarence', 'btw', 'two', 'shows', 'are', 'confirmed', '2013', 'LPT', '80', 'style', 'street', 'fighter/dbz', 'comedy/action', 'cartoon', 'awsome', 'worried', 'not', 'good', 'go', 'search', 'pilot', 'more', 'regular', 'show', 'formula', 'not', 'reperitive', 'least', 'episode', 'normal', 'day', 'top', 'adventure', 'are', 'so', 'creative', 'different', 'also', 'characters', 'voice', 'acting', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'funny', 'quotable', 'lines', 'im', 'sure', 'set', 'will', 'fit', 'collectors']",Regular Show: Season 1 & Season 2
1639062,A4Q6F1RGQ2WWM,B00BUAJZGY,Jimmy,"[0, 0]","I stumbled across this show one day and could not believe how much I enjoyed it. It's not the raunchy, over the top humor of Family Guy, South Park or even the Simpsons but its not totally childish or kid based. All of the characters are great and the episodes are short and sweet. The episodes almost always have some supernatural/over the top insanity and the humor ranges from things like masculine workouts, video games, binge eating, and bosses with anger issues. Its also great to have on if you just want something on in the background while you're hanging out with friends and want to occasionally pay attention to it and get a few laughs. If you're into animation or comedy at all then this is definitely worth a buy. For some reason Season 3 is not available on Blu Ray yet but this set is.",5,ADULTS and KIDS will love this show!,1403827200,"06 27, 2014",2014,800,"['stumbled', 'show', 'one', 'day', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'raunchy', 'top', 'humor', 'Family', 'Guy', 'South', 'Park', 'even', 'Simpsons', 'not', 'totally', 'childish', 'kid', 'based', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'episodes', 'are', 'short', 'sweet', 'episodes', 'almost', 'always', 'have', 'supernatural/over', 'top', 'insanity', 'humor', 'things', 'masculine', 'workouts', 'video', 'games', 'binge', 'eating', 'bosses', 'anger', 'issues', 'also', 'great', 'have', 'just', 'want', 'something', 'background', ""'re"", 'hanging', 'out', 'friends', 'want', 'occasionally', 'pay', 'attention', 'get', 'few', 'laughs', ""'re"", 'animation', 'comedy', 'then', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buy', 'reason', 'Season', '3', 'not', 'available', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'yet', 'set']",Regular Show: Season 1 & Season 2

1639065,ARAWVCUZQ6X4Q,B00BUAJZGY,King Me,"[1, 2]","I think this show is hilarious! But instead of the several excellent audio options listed on the box, this set only comes with dolby digital stereo. I had read that info in another review and really couldn't believe it. I considered canceling my order, but I really do like the show so I let it ride hoping that I wouldn't notice. Unfortunately, while having only stereo sound on a blu-ray set couldn't totally ruin this release of Regular Show, it did noticeably damage it. Regular Show sounds better in the HD broadcast on tv than on this release, so I do feel cheated. I had skipped the earlier dvd releases that were just compilations, hoping that they would release entire seasons and was thrilled to see TWO seasons on blu-ray. But now Cartoon Network DID manage to cheat me on this set. And with one of their BEST shows! Every disc release of Regular Show has been a cheat or a disappointment in some way, which is shameful. I blame only the people involved in how the discs would be created and released, and none of those involved in the creation of the clever and hilarious Regular Show itself. I, and anyone else who bought this set, should receive replacement blu-rays that DO have the audio options that were printed on the package. CBS sent out replacements of a few faulty discs on their Star Trek: The Next Generation Season 3 set, and Cartoon Network now needs to replace the faulty Regular Show discs.So, to sum up: Regular Show is excellent and incredibly funny, but Cartoon Network has again fumbled the discs that they chose to try to sell. I hope it was just a simple mistake on their part. If so, then send out replacement discs and they have a near-perfect release of a great show. If it was intentional, then again, send out replacement discs and don't pull that kind of nonsense again.",4,"Great show, but big cheat on audio",1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,1811,"['think', 'show', 'hilarious', 'instead', 'several', 'excellent', 'audio', 'options', 'listed', 'box', 'set', 'only', 'dolby', 'digital', 'stereo', 'had', 'read', 'info', 'review', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'considered', 'canceling', 'order', 'really', 'do', 'show', 'so', 'let', 'ride', 'hoping', 'would', ""n't"", 'notice', 'Unfortunately', 'having', 'only', 'stereo', 'sound', 'blu-ray', 'set', 'could', ""n't"", 'totally', 'ruin', 'release', 'Regular', 'Show', 'did', 'noticeably', 'damage', 'Regular', 'Show', 'better', 'HD', 'broadcast', 'tv', 'release', 'do', 'feel', 'cheated', 'had', 'skipped', 'earlier', 'dvd', 'releases', 'were', 'just', 'compilations', 'hoping', 'would', 'release', 'entire', 'seasons', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'TWO', 'seasons', 'blu-ray', 'now', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'DID', 'manage', 'cheat', 'set', 'one', 'BEST', 'Every', 'disc', 'release', 'Regular', 'Show', 'been', 'cheat', 'disappointment', 'way', 'shameful', 'blame', 'only', 'people', 'involved', 'how', 'discs', 'would', 'be', 'created', 'released', 'none', 'involved', 'creation', 'clever', 'hilarious', 'Regular', 'Show', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'bought', 'set', 'should', 'receive', 'replacement', 'blu-rays', 'DO', 'have', 'audio', 'options', 'were', 'printed', 'package', 'CBS', 'sent', 'out', 'replacements', 'few', 'faulty', 'discs', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Season', '3', 'set', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'now', 'replace', 'faulty', 'Regular', 'Show', 'discs.So', 'sum', 'up', 'Regular', 'Show', 'excellent', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'again', 'fumbled', 'discs', 'chose', 'try', 'sell', 'hope', 'was', 'just', 'simple', 'mistake', 'part', 'so', 'then', 'send', 'out', 'replacement', 'discs', 'have', 'near-perfect', 'release', 'great', 'show', 'was', 'intentional', 'then', 'again', 'send', 'out', 'replacement', 'discs', 'do', ""n't"", 'pull', 'kind', 'nonsense', 'again']",Regular Show: Season 1 & Season 2

It has pleanty of extras, a little weird to see Mordecai's voice, J. G. Quintel, speak since he doesn't talk any different than when he does Mordecai.The packaging is a little on the plain side, I'll admit, but really I don't care.  I rip these and put them on a box that plugs into my TV and watch them that way.  I don't keep the case on a shelf like a trophy to brag about the media I bought.  The case goes in a box into a closet with the discs in them so I never fault a DVD/Bluray set for shoddy cases.  As long as they protect the discs in shipment I could care less.Some of the words have been changed, don't know what ones, I know 'Pissed' has been changed to 'Ticked' but that is really the only thing that took away a star.  It doesn't bug me that much but I am a little upset when audio is changed in any kind of media just to make it more kid friendly.So yeah, I'd recommend the Bluray since it is such high quality.
