This is a way of life most people simply do not experience.Here's the scoop. Son Hayes (Michael Shannon) works on a fish farm. His wife has left him because he lost some money when his card counting ""method"" of gambling didn't quite work out. His one brother lives in a tent in Son's yard. His other brother lives in a van. They go to their estranged father's funeral. Said father left them with ""a hateful mother,"" married again and started another family. Son speaks some mean words at the funeral that begins a small feud. The feud escalates out of hand and deaths occur. Will this keep going or will cool heads prevail?This is a deliberately paced film. It IS slow but it's supposed to be. You need to pace yourself when you work in an oven. Everyone talks slow but with a certain directness. Few words are wasted here. It would be easy to call these folks white trash but that would be one dimensional. Yes. They don't live like most do. Yes one of their friends, who cooks meth, just burned down his house and injured himself. But they work, pay their bills and care for one another and aren't as judgmental as you might think. They aren't ugly, mean-spirited people (aside, maybe, from their mom). Son, who is the oldest of the brothers, seems to be the smartest. He is testing and honing his card counting method and has an even head. But each incidence of violence begs for a retaliatory response and even he starts to get caught up in it. I found myself hoping this wouldn't play to its logical end. But he does get to realize the true, underlying reason he so dislikes the other family and how this got the ball rolling in the first place.This is a well shot movie. Great respect is shown to landscape. Yes the town is eerily quiet but this is a depressed area. There isn't a lot of bustle. The music and sound design are exceptional. They underscore the action well. All the acting goes from good to great and much of the dialogue is good and well measured.

""Shotgun Stories"" offers evidence to the contrary. It's a real film, with real human emotion, with believable characters, story and setting. Nothing rings false. That is so monumentally rare in global cinema that it makes me proud that the film is American. And this is no flag-waiver fare. As a matter of fact it is politically opinionless. The concerns of a small inter-familial war can most definitely be symbolic of certain recent larger conflicts, but only on a universal level, in that all violence escalates from a certain point, and that start when viewed in hindsight is usually petty, but the damage unrepairable.The camera work is marvelous, the cast led by Michael Shannon is impeccable, and film is quietly moving. It's a true throwback to the maverick 1970s. The DVD even has the Lucero score on an isolated track, which I've let run in the background a few times while tending to household chores.

1154026,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0016MJ6I8,mirasreviews,"[2, 3]","In ""Shotgun Stories"", writer/director Jeff Nichols places a story of resentment and revenge in rural Arkansas. Three close-knit brothers attend the funeral of their father, who had stopped drinking, become religious, and started a new family after years of abusing his first family. The eldest brother, simply named Son (Michael Shannon), lets loose his hatred for his father at the funeral, setting off a feud with the four sons of his father's second family. Middle brother Boy (Douglas Ligon) is trepidatious about the escalating violence. Youngest brother Kid (Barlow Jacobs) is affable but intensely loyal. When the eldest of the second family's sons, Cleaman (Michael Abbott, Jr.), tries to head off the conflict, Son just can't let go of his bitterness and shame.A feud unfolds slowly and quietly in America's heartland. The brothers' mounting anger explodes in violence against an eerily uneventful background. There is a very nice score written in part by the director's brother Ben Nichols, which is used sparingly, allowing the isolated and measured quality of life to sink in. The success of this film is due to that tone, which the actors uphold admirably with unsentimental and unself-conscious performances. The feud results partly because some of the brothers are more like their father than they would like to admit, but perhaps even more because they have nothing to do. There is little distraction from the past's sins and the present anger. Films of family feuds are hardly new, but ""Shotgun Stories"" strikes an interesting note.The DVD (Liberation 2008): Bonus features include a Photo Gallery with a slide show of production stills, a theatrical trailer (2 min), and 2 audio options for viewing the film. You have the option of watching or listening to the film with only the music sound track, no dialogue or other sounds. There is definitely some good music in ""Shotgun Stories"", but it's too intermittent to make this option practical. There is also a fairly constant audio commentary by writer/director Jeff Nichols, in which he talks about filming in Arkansas, casting, the actors, the locations, cinematography, story, and his inspirations for various aspects of the film.

I think the film makers do an excellent job of fleshing out a character in his environment.Life is tough and without much future for this guy who would like better. His proud, tough stoic, independent character is adaptive. But this guy is not a hero as in the cowboy films of my youth. He is a tragic figure in my eyes because of the ways in which he holds in his feelings until they come out in ways that just dig him in deeper. Reason does not go very far in resolving things in this town in Arkansas -- but you get the feeling it could but they just don't see that path as something they could trust.Call it ignorance? -- I am not sure it is so simple. Life is not so easy there. He is a sad product of his environment. You can maybe understand his mother's bitterness and how this rubbed off on her boys and the tragic consequences, but we are not told what SHE suffered through and what made her bitter and hateful. And how much of  her husband's nastiness had been having to live with HER. We are left to wonder, but the film gives us a rich enough taste of life there to do some serious wondering. Was the nasty mother a product too of her environment? Elemental fighting, revenge, stand-offs are the most obvious ways to deal with feuds and grudges and they seem to work -- until they get out of hand. Then wham.

1154028,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B0016MJ6I8,Richard B. Schwartz,"[5, 8]","I just returned from Ebertfest.  Shotgun stories was my second favorite film, with first place going to von Sternberg's silent classic, Underworld.  With an academy-award winning script by Ben Hecht and superb acting from Clive Brook, Evelyn Brent and George Bancroft this is, to say the least, stiff competition.  Shotgun Stories is a small movie by a first-time director working on a small budget.  Nevertheless, it is a superb piece of work.  Set in Arkansas it is the story of a feud between two families who share a common father.  The director is Jeff Nichols.  Remember that name; you will be hearing it again and again.  This little film, which Nichols also wrote, is beautifully shot, beautifully acted, and fully realized.  I would not change a word or a moment of screen time.  Michael Shannon's acting is particularly memorable, but every member of the cast is excellent.  The plot is starkly simple.  A man dies.  The children from his first marriage come to the funeral, where the man is mourned by the wife and children of his second family.  One speaks briefly and then spits on his coffin.  An old feud is rekindled.  Violence follows, violence that is, ultimately, muted by the deep but barely-stated emotions of the brothers from the first family and the women who love them.

1154031,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B0016MJ6I8,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[12, 12]","First-time director Jeff Nichols managed to create this amazing minimalist film on a shoestring budget. I was impressed with how so much was told but at times hardly anything was happening. A worthy independent with a big-budget production feel to it.The cast was all recruited from nearby regions, including Michael Shannon, who gave a stellar performance as the lead brother. He is one of those actors where so much is said just by their minimal facial expressions. There are only a couple of familiar faces in the cast, otherwise this was an independent film all the way, but you would not know with the excellent acting by everyone.The film takes place (and is filmed) in Arkansas, including areas in and around Keo, England and Little Rock. My HD comment goes to the massive amounts of landscapes and topography that are shown throughout the film. The widescreen ratio beautifully displayed rural Arkansas farms, sunsets, and small town decay; the best I have see in a southern movie in years. I would love to see this artwork in Blu.The story is about three brothers living a simple existence, two work at a fish farm while the third moonlights as part-time teacher. Their bland lives are scattered with normal wants, including one who wants to get married, another wants to maintain a relationship with his son while dealing with his gambling and familial separations, and the last brother just ekes out a living from his van while coaching middle school kids in basketball. Their lives are shattered with violence when their estranged father dies and they decide to attend his funeral. A feud erupts between the dad's newer family and theirs as they all try to cope with their spite and hatred of each other.The story develops slowly but it reflects the pace of life there so eloquently. The script and scenes seemed so accurate of that lifestyle, including a sequence where the main characters run an extension cord into their home's backyard, connect it to an residential AC unit and set it on a picnic bench to keep cool while drinking beer. In another scene the van brother runs a hot-wired cord from his vehicle's motor to a blender so he can make drinks. Lots of these local subtleties that make for a worthwhile film that deserves to be seen. The soundtrack has some great cuts of local bands and is scored with a beautiful sounding instrument that is described in the commentary.The DVD has a brief photo mantage, a director's commentary, and a music only track of the film.
