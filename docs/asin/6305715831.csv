474034,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6305715831,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","This surreal adaptation of the Kurt Vonnegut novel hasn't a single sane person in it!Willis is the suicidal high-profile owner of a Midland City car dealership who seeks the meaning of life when he doesn't have a pistol barrel in his mouth. Hershey is his zoned-out-on-TV wife, Haas their fey and glittery lounge lizard organist son.Willis is having an affair with Headly, an oversexed secretary who's only in it for money: she wants to borrow from him the capital needed to open a fried chicken franchise. Nolte is Bruce's conservatively dressed sales manager who feels guilty about wearing women's lingerie at home. Epps is the recently paroled prisoner with a name similar to Willis'; he takes up residence in a purple car on Willis' lot, a place he calls ""Fairyland.""Finney is a spacey, philsophizing sci-fi author whose stories only appeared in cheap-o 1950s skin mags. Campbell is the eccentric millionaire who thinks Finney's the greatest writer of all time; he invites the reclusive author to Midland City for an honorarium.One of the the most underappreciated movies of all time. I love everything about it, especially Martin Denny's Exotica cocktail music (remember ""Quiet Village""?).(An ANNIE V.

474035,AHZJ4KTYBQ5KP,6305715831,Avrohom Leichtling,"[2, 2]","Certain of the films Bruce Willis has appeared in definitely cross the line between tongue-in-cheek and out and out surrealism, in the sense of Salvatore Dali or Heironymous Bosch. The most well known of these is certainly ""The Fifth Element"" - a wonderfully droll comedy of ultimate destruction! It is only recently that I encountered ""Breakfast of Champions"" as a film although I had been through Kurt Vonnegut's novel previously. There is the tired argument about how film adaptations of literary works are either too literal or too liberal. Film making is not novel writing, and even though the latter may be based on the former, it has to stand on its own merits irrespective of its origins. In this case, however loose the adaptation of the novel, the film works on so many levels. The clue, of course, if the title which, for those of you old enough to remember, was the advertising phrase for the breakfast cereal, Wheaties. That's enough of a clue - the crass fantasy world of television advertising, the brittle surface veneer covering a maelstrom of emotional angst, the absurd juxtapositions, the reversal of character where the seemingly crazy loner becomes the hero, the tragic ending where release brings resolution in the mental hospital lockup for one character, and death by dissolution into the running fantasy notion of paradise for the other. The ending of the film is terribly jarring - even if you expect it. Insanity is like that, I guess.For my money, it's a brilliant bit of film making. Perhaps the most jarring part of the illusion is Willis with a head of hair and thin, steel framed glasses!This is not one for people who can only think in linear fashion - no fantasy, especially surrealism, operates that way. Too many people complained, for example about the third ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" - it was too complex, went in too many directions, had too much detail. Nonsense. Too much of our pop culture is single tracked hip-hop sterile. Just as in music there are more meters than 2 or 3, so too in literature, the visual arts and in cinema as well.Bravo.

But, one of my kids brought the film home, so I bit that bullet and sat down and watched it.You've read enough reviews by now to get some gist of the story, so I won't go into that again, except to say that it has to do with the madness that results from living a completely amoral and unfulfilling existence. Vonnegut is, I believe, primarily a philosopher and a very funny man who has the rare talent of pulling all of life's absurdities into some kind of focus. It is true that his books do not translate well to the screen because it is his dialogue that is so important and this is generally excluded. However. Breakfast of Champions, however much it could not remain completely faithful to the book, stands as a work of art in its own right. It is very Terry Gilliam in its approach and over-all strangeness, including the plethora of eccentric characters; the cinematography is superb and the acting is brilliant. If you like Gilliam and cult films and David Lynch, you'll probably enjoy this film. If, on the other hand, you tend more towards Speilberg, you will probably find the film an incomprehensible mess. I absolutely do not agree with those who off-handedly bashed the film to pieces as there was a great deal of thought and even love put into this film, and the fact that some find it incomprehensible does not mean that it isn't, only that they are incapable of understanding and appreciating it.",4,An unexpected surprise,1019606400,"04 24, 2002",2002,1590,"['have', 'forgone', 'watching', 'film', 'now', 'due', 'very', 'bad', 'reviews', 'fear', 'seeing', 'one', 'favourite', 'authors', 'pulverized', 'travesty', 'one', 'great', 'works', 'one', 'kids', 'brought', 'film', 'home', 'so', 'bit', 'bullet', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'it.You', ""'ve"", 'read', 'enough', 'reviews', 'now', 'get', 'gist', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'again', 'say', 'do', 'madness', 'results', 'living', 'completely', 'amoral', 'unfulfilling', 'existence', 'Vonnegut', 'believe', 'primarily', 'philosopher', 'very', 'funny', 'man', 'who', 'rare', 'talent', 'pulling', 'life', 'absurdities', 'kind', 'focus', 'true', 'books', 'do', 'not', 'translate', 'well', 'screen', 'dialogue', 'so', 'important', 'generally', 'excluded', 'However', 'Breakfast', 'Champions', 'however', 'much', 'could', 'not', 'remain', 'completely', 'faithful', 'book', 'work', 'art', 'own', 'right', 'very', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'approach', 'over-all', 'strangeness', 'including', 'plethora', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'cinematography', 'superb', 'acting', 'brilliant', 'like', 'Gilliam', 'cult', 'films', 'David', 'Lynch', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'tend', 'more', 'towards', 'Speilberg', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'film', 'incomprehensible', 'mess', 'absolutely', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'who', 'off-handedly', 'bashed', 'film', 'pieces', 'was', 'great', 'deal', 'thought', 'even', 'love', 'put', 'film', 'fact', 'find', 'incomprehensible', 'not', 'mean', ""n't"", 'only', 'are', 'incapable', 'understanding', 'appreciating']",Breakfast of Champions VHS

Barry, for instance. in the book, he ended up resembling a Chinaman by a quirk of Nature, and that's why he's taken to dressing like one. in the film the character is portrayed by Buck Henry, who looks about as Oriental as Pamela Anderson, so it was a sizable goof to incorporate the character's sartorial eccentricity.

(how can the co-creator of GET SMART possibly go wrong?) it's just that without the Chinese-like features, draping him in Chinese wardrobe is just weird and distracting.another stumbling block is the character of Wayne Hoobler, the ex-con who assumes he was meant to work with Dwayne Hoover or they wouldn't have such similar names. the film seems unsure just what to do with the character. his frequent blathering about his ""Fairyland"" fantasy (as opposed to keeping it a secret for fear of embarassment, as in the book) seems to be the one thing he was given to do. his journey in the book has a certain poignancy, but said journey translates rather clumsily to film.the film makes several such desperate attempts to invoke elements of the book that there really isn't adequate room for, and which it doesn't really need anyway. why for instance, do we need to know that Dwayne Hoover was adopted? in the book, it's to set up a subplot about how the ""Sacred Miracle Cave,"" local tourist attraction Dwayne co-owns with his stepbrothers, has become contaminated with toxic waste and has to be closed down and fumigated. this is basically yet another crisis with which to nudge Dwayne that much closer to ""the edge,"" but cinema can build up to his ultimate suceptibility to panic without such incidental premables, and that's the way it should. so establishing Dawyne's adoption is a loose end, one of many that result in an overall lack of focus.and then there's the fact that Dwayne's ultimate rampage is toned down considerably. he wreaks sufficient havoc that we get to see him arrested, but the much narrower trail of carange in his path, to say nothing of not getting to see him lose everything in subsequent lawsuits (as in the book), is frankly an anticlimax on SO many levels. the basic story is the countdown to when Dwayne finally ""snaps,"" but he doesn't ""snap"" quite enough.so what was it then, you ask? how does a film manage to trandscend such severe weaknesses? what saving grace could possibly be powerful enough to take a film with this much working against it and actually raise it (albeit only about an inch or so) above the level of mediocrity that threatened to engulf it?well in this case, it's Albert Finney's masterful protrail of Vonnegut's signature character, aging literary failure Kilgore Trout. it will be remembered that Trout found his way into quite a few of Vonnegut's novels, including his most revered, SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE, but the closest he came to being a ""main"" character was in BREAKFAST. i've heard it's probably his most popular novel, and i hereby hazard a guess that this is the reason why.90% of when the film misfires is due to it's overemphasis on the comparatively bland character of Dwayne Hoover. Trout was never mentioned in any of the advertising campaign, and isn't even now on the videobox itself. maybe they figured that Kilgore Trout doesn't do as much, whereas Dwayne has a handful of problems to organize. i can see how that might work in theory, but in the application Finney is the one who steals the show!Bruce Willis is miscast, but on the whole a pretty good cast makes the best of what they're given to work with. Barbara Hershey makes an interestingly quirky character out of Dwayne's addled wife, which is no mean feat considered than in Vonnegut's version she had died before the story even began. Glenne Headley's secretary/mistress, like most of Headley's characters, manages to seem loopy without coming off as a complete flibertigibbet. and Nick Nolte displays a knack for broad comedy that you never would've suspected.one interesting new angle from director Alan Rupdolph is his take on commericals and how they impact our lives. Celia Hoover in particular tends to get her philosophical comfort from ""mottos"" which had in fact been designed to sell things. it's only fitting, given the the book's title had been an advertising slogan.when ya get right down to it, though, it is Finney who makes-or-breaks the production. he makes Trout into everything Vonnegut designed his as and more. he may not be the one and only worthy element of the film, but it is Finney (in my opinion, anyway) who lends the quality that renders the film worth at least one viewing. it is Finney's contribution which makes the film worth mentioning and recommending, albeit at a more modest level than, say, THE GODFATHER or STAR WARS.in short, the film is amusing enough to transcend at least some of it's weaknesses. BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS should've been so much more...but it COULD'VE been so much LESS.",4,A Love Of Vonnegut Prompts Forgiveness.

474046,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,6305715831,Michael Crane,"[19, 27]","You know, some books were never meant for the world of film.  Despite how popular and well loved they may be by everyone, that doesn't mean it'll make a successful movie.  &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; is a perfect example of this.  While it proves to be a masterpiece in the written form, it ends up being one lousy film that tries so hard to be funny and fails almost every time.The movie follows the basic premise of the book, but adds and changes things around (which I understand, because most of the stuff in that book wouldn't be able to translate on film--hence, why it should've never been done in the first place).  Dwayne Hoover is a car dealer that everybody loves and trusts.  Dwayne Hoover, is also losing his mind.  From his pill-popping wife to his cross-dressing business buddy, Dwayne is losing his grip on reality on a daily basis.  Soon, he will meet a sci-fi writer that nobody has ever heard of (except for one deranged fan), Kilgore Trout.  Their meeting will be the final straw for Dwayne and chaos will be the aftermath.What made the book so funny in the first place was the actual commentary by Vonnegut as the overall narrator.  It wasn't necessarily funny only because of the characters and their actions, but mainly because of Kurt Vonnegut's voice.  Of course, they have to do away with the narration in order to have it work on film.  The problem is, however, it doesn't work.  It feels like a bad imitation of &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.&quot;  It's rarely funny nor is it strange, it's just plain annoying.  The only way this film will be understood by others is if they have read the book ahead of time.  And even if they've done that, they'll only end up being more ticked off at the debauchery that is the movie, &quot;Breakfast of Champions.&quot;  I wasn't expecting a dead-on adaptation, just something to do the book some kind of justice.  Sorry to say, this film does no such thing.The DVD has almost no special features, and for the first time ever--I could care less.  In fact, I'd be even more ticked off if this DVD had tons of special features while other great movies have &quot;doodley-squat&quot; for special features.&quot;Breakfast of Champions,&quot; while a literary masterpiece, is a &quot;fabulously well-to-do&quot; dud as a movie.  I can't even recommend this to people who haven't read the book, as they'll most likely despise it since they will have no idea what is going on.  This movie is living proof that some timeless literary classics were never meant for the big screen.  I think Vonnegut would agree with that.  In fact, with all of the rants he does on entertainment, TV, and short attention spans, it wouldn't surprise me if Vonnegut structured the book to be un-filmable on purpose.  Avoid it and stick to the book, if you want my honest opinion. -Michael Crane",1,...And Cut,1082160000,"04 17, 2004",2004,2846,"['know', 'books', 'were', 'never', 'meant', 'world', 'film', 'how', 'popular', 'well', 'loved', 'may', 'be', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'ll"", 'make', 'successful', 'movie', 'quot', 'Breakfast', 'Champions', 'quot', 'perfect', 'example', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'written', 'form', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'lousy', 'film', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'almost', 'time.The', 'movie', 'basic', 'premise', 'book', 'changes', 'things', 'understand', 'most', 'stuff', 'book', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'translate', 'film', 'hence', 'why', 'should', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'done', 'first', 'place', 'Dwayne', 'Hoover', 'car', 'dealer', 'everybody', 'loves', 'trusts', 'Dwayne', 'Hoover', 'also', 'losing', 'mind', 'pill-popping', 'wife', 'cross-dressing', 'business', 'buddy', 'Dwayne', 'losing', 'grip', 'reality', 'daily', 'basis', 'Soon', 'will', 'meet', 'sci-fi', 'writer', 'nobody', 'ever', 'heard', 'one', 'deranged', 'fan', 'Kilgore', 'Trout', 'meeting', 'will', 'be', 'final', 'straw', 'Dwayne', 'chaos', 'will', 'be', 'aftermath.What', 'made', 'book', 'so', 'funny', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'actual', 'commentary', 'Vonnegut', 'overall', 'narrator', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'funny', 'only', 'characters', 'actions', 'mainly', 'Kurt', 'Vonnegut', 'voice', 'course', 'have', 'do', 'away', 'narration', 'order', 'have', 'work', 'film', 'problem', 'however', ""n't"", 'work', 'bad', 'imitation', 'quot', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'Las', 'Vegas.', 'quot', 'rarely', 'funny', 'strange', 'just', 'plain', 'annoying', 'only', 'way', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'understood', 'others', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'ahead', 'time', 'even', ""'ve"", 'done', ""'ll"", 'only', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'more', 'ticked', 'off', 'debauchery', 'movie', 'quot', 'Breakfast', 'Champions.', 'quot', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'dead-on', 'adaptation', 'just', 'something', 'do', 'book', 'kind', 'justice', 'Sorry', 'say', 'film', 'such', 'thing.The', 'DVD', 'almost', 'special', 'features', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'fact', ""'d"", 'be', 'even', 'more', 'ticked', 'off', 'DVD', 'had', 'tons', 'special', 'features', 'other', 'great', 'movies', 'have', 'quot', 'doodley-squat', 'quot', 'special', 'features.', 'quot', 'Breakfast', 'Champions', 'quot', 'literary', 'masterpiece', 'quot', 'fabulously', 'well-to-do', 'quot', 'dud', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'despise', 'will', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'movie', 'living', 'proof', 'timeless', 'literary', 'classics', 'were', 'never', 'meant', 'big', 'screen', 'think', 'Vonnegut', 'would', 'agree', 'fact', 'rants', 'entertainment', 'TV', 'short', 'attention', 'spans', 'would', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'Vonnegut', 'structured', 'book', 'be', 'un-filmable', 'purpose', 'Avoid', 'stick', 'book', 'want', 'honest', 'opinion', '-Michael', 'Crane']",Breakfast of Champions VHS

The characters are cartoon personifications  of annoying people, and the setting is generally a middle-America, strip  mall-saturated, consumer-ish nightmare. Just bringing the audience up to  speed on the story environment is difficult to visually represent within  the timeframe of an average movie.The acting is done well, especially  Albert Finney as Kilgore Trout, Vonnegut's alter ego that appears in many  of his books. Bruce Willis does an adequate job as Dwayne Hoover as does  Barbara Hershey as his wife, but the story didn't allow us understand them  enough. Once again, putting a Vonnegut book to film and making it complete  within 2 hours is, in my opinion, an impossible task.But unlike most  similar book-to-movie transitions, ""Breakfast of Champions"" holds true to  the book, so much that it falls short of conveying the roles and  motivations of the characters and circumstances.

Bruce Willis (who's great in his role) stars as a man who is loosing his grip on reality and his wife, who's just as weird, played by Barabara Hershey. The films starts out with Bruce Willis about to commit suicide (which he tries continually throughout the film)and we see how messed up he is. Then we are introduced to a man named Harry played by Nick Nolte, a cross dressing psycho, who's free time consists of nothing but sex with his girlfriend, played by Kathy Griffin (who I don't care for). Then we are introduced to an old fluff writer, played wonderfully by Albert Finney. After all the characters are oddly introduced. We get to know them quit well. By the end of the movie everyone has gone crazy, and it makes you feel quite crazy too. Though hilarious and crazy, this film has some good points. The very end is just like &quot;Wow&quot;, so...it DID have a point. All in all, a great film, I'll never forget. Also stars Glenne Headly, Owen Wilson, Buck Henry and Omar Epps. (WARNING: This movie does have a very violent and grotutus (spelling) sex scene. One of the most explicite I've ever seen. Very disturbing, so just watch out for that!

Mainstream comedy viewers would tuck tail and run from a film like this, while the Vonnegut fans will(and do) hate it because of the plot changes and missing elements from the book.  So I guess that just leaves that small number of folks who like far out and bizarre comedies.  Now, I personally don't like comedies just for the fact that they're odd, but I do have a fascination in seeing high profile actors doing things we hardly ever see them do.  This came out at the right time coz Willis was hot from that Armageddon pile of sludge.Breakfast of Champions is one of those films based on an ""unfilmable"" novel.  We've seen this before in movies like Naked Lunch(mixed reviews from critics and Burroughs fans) and American Psycho(actually got favorable reviews).  Doing Vonnegut is difficult coz his work is made for the book format due to his quirky and unique narration style.  Naturally with a movie you pretty much lose that.  One of the best things about Breakfast of Champions(the book) is that Vonnegut was the narrator and let the reader know that he was.  He even puts himself in the story as a character! This is all lost in the film.Plus there are indeed changes made to the story which seem totally unnecessary and certainly don't add to or clarify the story in any way.  I can definitely see why Vonnegut fans did not like this movie.  However, and I'm only guessing here, I think Vonnegut himself might have liked the offbeat and wacky tone of this movie.  He does have a cameo in it as well.Many folks have gone into the plot, so I won't waste too much time on that, but here's a little rundown:  Duane Hoover(Bruce Willis) is a car salesman-a local celebrity everybody loves as though he were a movie star.  He's going crazy.  He doesn't know who he is or what his purpose is in life and he's off the deep end.  He deals with a cross dressing salesman(Nick Nolte), a crazy fan who may want to take his place(Omar Epps), a pill popping wife(Barbara Hershey), and a son who is just about the worst lounge singer you've ever heard(Lucas Haas).  Hoover thinks he might find some answers in Kilgore Trout(a reoccurring character in Vonnegut's novels), a failed Sci-Fi writer who has been invited to Hoover's town as part of an art festival.That's really about it.  The style of the movie is fast paced , cartoony, hallucinatory, and zany.  Everybody in this movie acts insane, especially Nolte and Epps.  Though the two films are quite different, I'd compare this movie to Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas as far as the tone and visuals go.  I realize that this isn't a great adaptation of a great novel, and that everyone hated it.  I do have to admit however ,judging strictly as a movie, I though it was pretty damn funny.  It doesn't all work, but some of it is quite clever and just so odd that it's hilarious.  Of course not everyone will agree with that, but humor is a very personalized thing.  I think Nolte steals the show.  I have never seen him act so crazy before and it's a trip to see him like that.  Epps would be a close second for the same reasons.  Albert Finney makes a good Kilgore Trout and Willis is passable enough as Hoover.  He definitely has his moments too!Watch at your own risk, coz this one is different to say the least.",4,"Yes, I Did Like This Movie",1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,3337,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'intended', 'audience', 'was', 'Breakfast', 'Champions', 'Mainstream', 'comedy', 'viewers', 'would', 'tuck', 'tail', 'run', 'film', 'Vonnegut', 'fans', 'will', 'do', 'hate', 'plot', 'changes', 'missing', 'elements', 'book', 'guess', 'just', 'small', 'number', 'folks', 'who', 'like', 'far', 'out', 'bizarre', 'comedies', 'Now', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'comedies', 'just', 'fact', ""'re"", 'odd', 'do', 'have', 'fascination', 'seeing', 'high', 'profile', 'actors', 'doing', 'things', 'hardly', 'ever', 'see', 'do', 'came', 'out', 'right', 'time', 'coz', 'Willis', 'was', 'hot', 'Armageddon', 'pile', 'sludge.Breakfast', 'Champions', 'one', 'films', 'based', 'unfilmable', 'novel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'Naked', 'Lunch', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'critics', 'Burroughs', 'fans', 'American', 'Psycho', 'actually', 'got', 'favorable', 'reviews', 'Doing', 'Vonnegut', 'difficult', 'coz', 'work', 'made', 'book', 'format', 'due', 'quirky', 'unique', 'narration', 'style', 'Naturally', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'lose', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'Breakfast', 'Champions', 'book', 'Vonnegut', 'was', 'narrator', 'let', 'reader', 'know', 'was', 'even', 'story', 'character', 'lost', 'film.Plus', 'are', 'indeed', 'changes', 'made', 'story', 'seem', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'clarify', 'story', 'way', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'why', 'Vonnegut', 'fans', 'did', 'not', 'movie', 'However', ""'m"", 'only', 'guessing', 'here', 'think', 'Vonnegut', 'might', 'have', 'liked', 'offbeat', 'wacky', 'tone', 'movie', 'have', 'cameo', 'well.Many', 'folks', 'have', 'gone', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'here', 'little', 'rundown', 'Duane', 'Hoover', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'car', 'salesman-a', 'local', 'celebrity', 'everybody', 'were', 'movie', 'star', 'going', 'crazy', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'what', 'purpose', 'life', 'deep', 'end', 'cross', 'dressing', 'salesman', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'crazy', 'fan', 'who', 'may', 'want', 'take', 'place', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'pill', 'popping', 'wife', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'son', 'who', 'just', 'worst', 'lounge', 'singer', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'Lucas', 'Haas', 'might', 'find', 'answers', 'Kilgore', 'Trout', 'reoccurring', 'character', 'Vonnegut', 'novels', 'failed', 'Sci-Fi', 'writer', 'who', 'been', 'invited', 'Hoover', 'town', 'part', 'art', 'festival.That', 'really', 'style', 'movie', 'fast', 'paced', 'cartoony', 'hallucinatory', 'zany', 'Everybody', 'movie', 'insane', 'especially', 'Nolte', 'Epps', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'quite', 'different', ""'d"", 'compare', 'movie', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'as', 'far', 'tone', 'visuals', 'go', 'realize', ""n't"", 'great', 'adaptation', 'great', 'novel', 'everyone', 'hated', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'however', 'judging', 'strictly', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'damn', 'funny', ""n't"", 'work', 'quite', 'clever', 'just', 'so', 'odd', 'hilarious', 'course', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'agree', 'humor', 'very', 'personalized', 'thing', 'think', 'Nolte', 'show', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'act', 'so', 'crazy', 'trip', 'see', 'Epps', 'would', 'be', 'close', 'second', 'same', 'reasons', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'good', 'Kilgore', 'Trout', 'Willis', 'passable', 'enough', 'Hoover', 'definitely', 'moments', 'too', 'Watch', 'own', 'risk', 'coz', 'one', 'different', 'say', 'least']",Breakfast of Champions VHS
