This movie also stars Andy Garcia(When A Man Loves a Woman,Desperate Measures) and Mariel Hemingway(Bad Moon). Of course there is a cat and mouse game between the killer,reporter and the police. This movie is prefect for a hot summer night as it takes place during the summer! The Mean Seaon is rated R for swearing and violence.The DVD is Ok, The only thing you get with the DVD is the trailer. I wish MGM would add more features on this such as a behind the scenes,cast bios, other MGM movies the stars have been in like &quot;Winter People&quot; with Kurt Russell, delated scenes etc.  Only buy this movie if you like this kind of thriller and can live with the features!",3,"A suspenseful movie,patheric DVD,no extras just the trailer!",995155200,"07 15, 2001",2001,820,"['movie', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Maimi', 'news', 'reporter', 'who', 'public', 'mouth', 'piece', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'times', 'movie', 'also', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'When', 'Man', 'Woman', 'Desperate', 'Measures', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'Bad', 'Moon', 'course', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'killer', 'reporter', 'police', 'movie', 'prefect', 'hot', 'summer', 'night', 'place', 'summer', 'Mean', 'Seaon', 'rated', 'R', 'swearing', 'violence.The', 'DVD', 'Ok', 'only', 'thing', 'get', 'DVD', 'trailer', 'wish', 'MGM', 'would', 'add', 'more', 'features', 'such', 'scenes', 'cast', 'bios', 'other', 'MGM', 'movies', 'stars', 'have', 'been', 'quot', 'Winter', 'People', 'quot', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'delated', 'scenes', 'etc', 'Only', 'buy', 'movie', 'like', 'kind', 'thriller', 'can', 'live', 'features']",N/A

574812,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B000059TGB,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","I've read ""How to Write a Selling Screenplay"" a couple of times, a how-to book written by Christopher Keane.  Besides using a verb as an adjective in the title (I wouldn't normally complain, but he is a writer and so hopefully he thought long and hard first before making that awkward choice), and besides the fact that it's a little too upbeat and optimistic for my tastes, it's actually a pretty decent read.  It discusses the ins and outs of the film business -- what American audiences want, and perhaps more important still, what directors and producers demand, from screenplays -- and what steps that a wannabe screenwriter must take if he wants to become rich and famous.  At least not ignored.The book argues that one of the requirements of a screenplay is that the movie opens with the protagonist being at a crossroads in his life; he must be facing the biggest challenge ever.  And the audience will either love or hate that protagonist not necessarily based upon the ending, but rather what steps he takes to get out of his predicament.  Most people will probably nod their heads and say, ""Sounds good to me,"" and then go back to munching that overly-salted-and-artery-clogging-butter-overloaded popcorn.But the problem is, if you use the above rule, and you write a screenplay about a guy like Kurt Russell -- a reporter named Malcolm Anderson for a Miami newspaper that is involved in a dialog with a serial killer -- it is almost necessary that things get overly personal for our protagonist.  (Spoiler Alert:  Jump to the next paragraph if you haven't yet seen this film, not that I'm recommending watching it myself.)  What does this mean?  Well, of course it means that the wife of Malcolm must become a target for the serial killer (ugh).  You've seen this a thousand times before, and you'll see it a thousand times again (sigh).  And then you see him rushing to save the day, by leaving his car parked running at a train crossing (really?), running on foot after that (ouch), and then jumping from one side of a drawbridge that is in the middle of opening to the other side, and just hanging on that other side for dear life (you are kidding, right?).  Wow.  This all feels like script changes last-minute to please some producer in Hollywood that wants to keep getting paychecks.  (End spoiler alert.)You can blame filmmakers for doing these things, but in reality, I'll blame the American public.  After all, Americans eat this stuff up -- just like that popcorn we discussed above -- which means they pay tickets for films with these rehashed plot elements.  Filmmakers don't do volunteer work in general -- it costs lots of money to make movies, and if they want to continue making films, they have to keep pumping out crowd pleasers to fund the next bad project -- and so those filmmakers continue writing the same basic script over and over and over.  So, I blame you, you wretched American audience!To be fair, this film isn't completely wretched itself as it starts out strong, and I was actually tempted to give this a very weak 4 rating.  But I just couldn't do it without selling my soul.  Even though I believe that the acting is actually pretty good, and even though I believe that the cast is fairly strong, I just believe that rarely can a group of even the most talented actors make up for a screenplay that was doomed to be a derivative mess by unraveling towards the end.A couple of minor points of interest for me here.  1.  I believe that this film was influenced by the Zodiac Killer.  He had a dialog with a newspaper in San Francisco, like here, although the Zodiac only wrote letters to that newspaper I think.  Supposedly he did phone a psychiatrist on live TV once, although many people believe that it was a hoax.  2.  There is a shot of a stadium here, and at first I thought that it was Joe Robbie, or whatever it's called nowadays after a million name changes.  But peeking at the year the film released, and peeking at when ground was broken at Joe Robbie -- it was about the same time in 1985 -- it might have been a shot of the Orange Bowl.  Anyone know?But anyways, I would argue that Americans should demand more originality from film.  Until this happens, filmmakers will continue pumping out mediocre work that could have been really good.",3,Demand More!,1392249600,"02 13, 2014",2014,4297,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'How', 'Write', 'Selling', 'Screenplay', 'couple', 'times', 'how-to', 'book', 'written', 'Christopher', 'Keane', 'using', 'verb', 'adjective', 'title', 'would', ""n't"", 'normally', 'complain', 'writer', 'so', 'hopefully', 'thought', 'long', 'hard', 'first', 'making', 'awkward', 'choice', 'fact', 'little', 'too', 'upbeat', 'optimistic', 'tastes', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'read', 'ins', 'outs', 'film', 'business', 'what', 'American', 'audiences', 'want', 'perhaps', 'more', 'important', 'still', 'what', 'directors', 'producers', 'demand', 'screenplays', 'what', 'wannabe', 'screenwriter', 'must', 'take', 'become', 'rich', 'famous', 'least', 'not', 'ignored.The', 'book', 'one', 'requirements', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'protagonist', 'being', 'crossroads', 'life', 'must', 'be', 'facing', 'biggest', 'challenge', 'ever', 'audience', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'protagonist', 'not', 'necessarily', 'based', 'ending', 'rather', 'what', 'get', 'predicament', 'Most', 'people', 'will', 'probably', 'nod', 'heads', 'say', 'good', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'munching', 'overly-salted-and-artery-clogging-butter-overloaded', 'popcorn.But', 'problem', 'use', 'above', 'rule', 'write', 'screenplay', 'guy', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'reporter', 'named', 'Malcolm', 'Anderson', 'Miami', 'newspaper', 'involved', 'dialog', 'serial', 'killer', 'almost', 'necessary', 'things', 'get', 'overly', 'personal', 'protagonist', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'Jump', 'next', 'paragraph', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'film', 'not', ""'m"", 'recommending', 'watching', 'What', 'mean', 'Well', 'course', 'wife', 'Malcolm', 'must', 'become', 'target', 'serial', 'killer', 'ugh', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thousand', 'times', ""'ll"", 'see', 'thousand', 'times', 'again', 'sigh', 'then', 'see', 'rushing', 'save', 'day', 'leaving', 'car', 'parked', 'running', 'train', 'crossing', 'really', 'running', 'foot', 'ouch', 'then', 'jumping', 'one', 'side', 'drawbridge', 'middle', 'opening', 'other', 'side', 'just', 'hanging', 'other', 'side', 'dear', 'life', 'are', 'kidding', 'right', 'Wow', 'feels', 'script', 'changes', 'last-minute', 'please', 'producer', 'Hollywood', 'keep', 'getting', 'paychecks', 'End', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'can', 'blame', 'filmmakers', 'doing', 'things', 'reality', ""'ll"", 'blame', 'American', 'public', 'Americans', 'eat', 'stuff', 'up', 'just', 'popcorn', 'discussed', 'pay', 'tickets', 'films', 'rehashed', 'plot', 'elements', 'Filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'volunteer', 'work', 'general', 'lots', 'money', 'make', 'movies', 'want', 'continue', 'making', 'films', 'have', 'keep', 'pumping', 'out', 'crowd', 'pleasers', 'fund', 'next', 'bad', 'project', 'so', 'filmmakers', 'continue', 'writing', 'same', 'basic', 'script', 'over', 'So', 'blame', 'wretched', 'American', 'audience', 'be', 'fair', 'film', ""n't"", 'completely', 'wretched', 'out', 'strong', 'was', 'actually', 'tempted', 'give', 'very', 'weak', '4', 'rating', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'selling', 'soul', 'Even', 'believe', 'acting', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'even', 'believe', 'cast', 'fairly', 'strong', 'just', 'believe', 'rarely', 'can', 'group', 'even', 'most', 'talented', 'actors', 'make', 'up', 'screenplay', 'was', 'doomed', 'be', 'derivative', 'mess', 'unraveling', 'end.A', 'couple', 'minor', 'points', 'interest', 'here', '1', 'believe', 'film', 'was', 'influenced', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'had', 'dialog', 'newspaper', 'San', 'Francisco', 'here', 'Zodiac', 'only', 'wrote', 'letters', 'newspaper', 'think', 'Supposedly', 'did', 'phone', 'psychiatrist', 'live', 'TV', 'once', 'many', 'people', 'believe', 'was', 'hoax', '2', 'shot', 'stadium', 'here', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'Joe', 'Robbie', 'whatever', 'called', 'nowadays', 'million', 'name', 'changes', 'peeking', 'year', 'film', 'released', 'peeking', 'when', 'ground', 'was', 'broken', 'Joe', 'Robbie', 'was', 'same', 'time', '1985', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'Orange', 'Bowl', 'Anyone', 'know', 'would', 'argue', 'Americans', 'should', 'demand', 'more', 'originality', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'will', 'continue', 'pumping', 'out', 'mediocre', 'work', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'good']",N/A

He begrudgingly gets assigned a murder case that ends up turning into a serial murder case.  Mariel Hemingway portrays his girlfriend.  Her role in the film is largely unnecessary until the last third of the film.  Hemingway isn't a bad actress, but I must confess I've never seen any alure to her - she looks like a 14 year old boy, not a woman.The film maintains excellent attention to detail and superb suspense throughout.  My complaint with the film is simple:  A murder mystery/thriller should answer questions it poses.  Mean Season does not.Why is the killer doing what he is doing?  What is his motive?  We are provided what seem to be the reasons for the murders, but are later told that the scenario was a red herring provided by the killer.  So were his reasons the real ones or part of the whole red herring ploy?  We aren't told.  In reality many criminals don't actually have legitimate motives - but in films of this nature, it is a requirement.I can't say that I didn't enjoy this film - because I did.

574823,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B000059TGB,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","The Mean Season(released Feb/85)is a look back at Kurt Russell in his salad days,enjoying what would become the biggest years of his popularity.I wish it were otherwise as Kurt has done some fine work since that time,but I think he is more choosier nowadays of what he takes,keeping to about one project a year.Along side Kurt in this nice thriller is Mariel Hemingway as his girlfriend,Richard Jordan as the killer,a young Andy Garcia as a cop,and many other assorted good supporting members.The plot finds Kurt as a burned out reporter with the Miami Herald,who lives with his girlfriend teacher Mariel.Both are wanting a change of scenery and plan to soon move away from the Miami area altogether.Just as Kurt finally gets up the will to leave he gets an assignment to cover a girls murder.He does so but soon gets a call from the killer himself.He's out to kill five people and he wants Kurt to listen to him and be his conduit to the media.Kurt faithfully,but with increasing frustration,follows along,as person after person gets killed as per the killers messages.Finally a lead comes up which takes Kurts to a trailer park.A man who lives there gives Kurt a lead on who the killer is,by name.It turns out,afterwards,it was false and Kurt actually had a meeting with the killer himself.As time progresses the killer becomes frustrated with Kurt,believing that Kurt is now getting more of the media attention that he should be getting.Victim four comes and goes,and Russell and the police finally get a solid lead on their man.However the killer has kidnapped Kurt's girlfriend,who it looks like is about to become victim five.The lead takes them to the swamps and they finally catch up with him.The killer briefly has Kurt and the cops pinned down but a shot rings through the underbrush and a dead body is found.It appears the killer has taken his own life and Kurt's girlfriend is found safe and sound.The two are back home one evening making plans,and glad the events of the past while are finally behind them.As they are talking the killer appears,very much alive and loaded for bear.Kurt and the killer struggle and Kurt gets the upper hand by obtaining the killer's own gun.Kurt has the weapon pointed at him,but the killer doesn't believe he will shoot.The killer walks slowly closer and Kurt has no choice but to take him down.The film ends as Kurt and his wife sit in a far off deserted newspaper room,of which he is now the managing editor.The film slowly builds its premise,as the killer gets bolder,more murders pile up and Kurt's frustration and relationship breakdown reach the boiling point.Richard Jordan does a wonderful job in his portrayal of the crazed killer;very menacing when needed and with a terribly sick but calculating bent thrown in for good measure.Mariel supports Kurt the best she can and Kurt plays it right down the middle with the right emotions at the right times.Well done all around.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include just the trailer.All in all a very nice trip down memory lane with this 80s thriller starring Russell and company.The plot is well played out,with some nice twists and turns,and the tension builds from beginning to end.Recommended.",4,3 1/2-4 stars-A nice 80s
