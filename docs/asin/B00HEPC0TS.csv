If you read the opening credits, you'll find that Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay and produced the film.  If I had his address, I'd personally write him to ask for my money back.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because of Statham.  Decent fight scenes but that's it.  If you watched it, and liked it, ask yourself, would a former undercover policeman travel with numerous file boxes containing info about his cases and secret identities?

1688108,A3BMUBUC1N77U8,B00HEPC0TS,ahoffoss,"[21, 31]","Let me start by saying that Jason Statham and James Franco are two of my favorite actors.  That alone is good enough to merit at least 4 stars before I even see the movie!  The fact that this was written by Sylvester Stallone might turn a few people off.  I mean, let's be honest,...he's not exactly known lately for his uber quality in movies!  HOWEVER, this one is FANTASTIC!!!!*******WARNING,.....If you continue to read I might spoil the movie (although I will try to leave as much out as possible)!*******The movie begins with Phil Broker (Jason Statham) as an undercover officer who has worked his way into the role of a leading man in a biker gang known as the ""Outcasts"".  These guys are heavy hitters in the drug trade and he has set the stage for the DEA to make the big bust.  Things go slightly wrong and the leader of the gang, Danny T (Chuck Zito) is captured while his son dies in a police shootout.  Danny T, of course, blames Brocker for the death of his son after seeing that he IS, in fact, an undercover officer.The movie then skips ahead some time in the future (we'll say a year, give or take?).  Broker and his daughter, Maddy (Izabela Vidovic) now live in Northern Louisiana. (his wife has since passed away)  While attending school, a bully steals Maddy's hat and is quickly beaten down after she gives him, what she calls, ""his two warnings"".  This results in Broker getting called to school along with the bully's parents, Cassie (Kate Bosworth) and Jimmy Klum (Marcus Hester) being called in as well.At this point, I'd like to take the time to explain just how underrated an actress I think Kate Bosworth is.  She can go from a beautiful college student (21), to this movie, playing a cracked out looking, piece of trash and pull it off flawlessly!  That's a total compliment, just to make sure.  And props to the makeup crew for being able to transform a woman like Kate into this mess and be completely believable.  Back to the review......Cassie basically goes NUTS on Broker and demands an apology, to which Broker has none.  While leaving, she forces Jimmy to confront Broker, to absolutely no avail.  After they get home and Cassie belittles Jimmy, she calls on her brother, Gator (James Franco) to help straighten out the situation.  At this point, we've seen what type of person Gator is from an earlier scene in the movie (that was ridiculously AWESOME, by the way).  Gator sends two guys to help Broker with his supposed ""attitude"" only to have Broker straighten those guys out as well.  (Again,...AWESOME!)  Here we see the sheriff (Clancy Brown,....better known as CAPTAIN HADLEY from 'The Shawshank Redemption') pulling over Broker and having another ""friendly"" chat.  Broker decides to make piece after discovering his house was broken into (at which point, Gater discovers Broker's former identity) and heads to talk to Cassie and Jimmy.  He apologized, but doesn't realize that it's too late for them all since Gator is now intent on telling Danny T, he knows where his former ""friend"" is.  Gator sends Sheryl (Winona Rider) to talk with Danny's lawyer and set up a deal that will allow Gator complete distribution for the drugs he creates.  Danny T sends his best man, Cyrus (Frank Grillo) to deal with the whole situation.  Afterwards, Cyrus and crew refuse Gators offer an force Sheryl to tell them where Broker is.  Things go wrong at Broker's house and Maddy gets taken by Sheryl.  Gator is far from pleased that she'd bring a ""witness"" back and is about to put a stop to the situation when Cassie and Jimmy show up to talk.  While discovering what is going on, Cassie inadvertently ignites a trap that Broker had set earlier on, leaving Gator without drug organization.In the final scene, we find Broker (being the complete badass that he is) going to the jail to personally deliver a message for Danny T.All in all, if you want a great action movie, then this is the one for you!  Great acting and story all around!

Unfortunately when his daughter defends herself against the town bully whose uncle happens to be the towns drug lord Gator Bodine played by James Franco, life becomes just a little more complicated. He tries to keep the peace going as far as apologizing for any misunderstanding but the bully's mother won't let it go. Once Gator learns who Broker is he calls on his sleazy girlfriend played by Winona Ryder to help him get rid of Broker. What they didn't count on was Broker's old enemy coming for him as well and when his daughter's life is endangered, Broker uses his considerable skill to protect her and his friends. The movie did get a bit slow and if you are a Statham fan, you will not be used to him being so tame as he tries to keep the peace.

1688161,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00HEPC0TS,David Baldwin,"[1, 2]","Let me preface my review by saying I'm a huge Jason Statham fan who has followed his career path since he debuted in 1998 in Guy Ritchie's ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" and anticipate each new film of his with baited breath.  This film is not on par with his other efforts from last year, ""Parker"" and ""Redemption"".  This is not to suggest that Statham is not trying to extend himself as an actor  because he demonstrates terrific range particularly in the tender scenes he shares with the young actress playing his daughter.  It's just that this film is so clich&eacute;d and predictable.  There's nothing wrong with formula if it works but Sylvester Stallone's script is so rife with convention that a sense of deja vu starts to permeate the proceedings.  James Franco as the meth dealer appears to be sleepwalking through this one seemingly effected by being in every other film last year and taking too many film classes.  The most interesting thing about his character is his name, Gator Bodine, which suggests Burt Reynolds and Max Baer, Jr.  Winona Ryder is completely clueless as Franco's white trash girlfriend.  The best supporting performance is offered up by Kate Bosworth as Franco's drug addict sister.  A thought.  Statham has established himself as a reliable box office draw here and internationally.

1688185,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00HEPC0TS,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","How is it that Jason Statham has such a hard time getting good roles? People like him. He's about as good an action star as his contemporaries. Even this outing, while marginally better than some of his other films, falls short.Here's the scoop. Statham plays a DEA agent who retires after a particularly nasty, violent sting and moves with his daughter to northern Louisiana where he hopes to live a quiet life. Fat chance. of that happening. It seems Meth is a big deal in those parts and events conspire to draw him into a situation he was trying to leave behind.Sylvester Stallone wrote the script which was based on a novel. I haven't read the source so I don't know how far the script strayed, but it just wasn't that good. Things start off really well. The opening, partially failed sting. The switch to the more peaceful setting, as we watch his young daughter turn the tables on the bully, play well. But then things head south. The set-up to get the heat turned up held too much coincidence for my liking. That Winona Ryder agreed to such a small, sketchy role was curious. I kept figuring her part would escalate as the movie progressed. That it didn't helped to drag things down. I'm not a huge James Franco fan but this is about as good as I've seen him. Jason Statham didn't move out of his comfort zone but we really don't want/expect him to. There are some other established actors throughout that do well with what they're given.Director Gary Fleder did a decent job here. Nice attention is paid to the locations and he draws some good performances out of people. I also liked Mark Isham's music score. It added flavor without making itself too conspicuous. To me this failed at the script level. The longer it ran the worse it got.

I _will_ watch a movie just cause I saw his canon-ball head with a 5 o'clock shadow on the box. Say what you will, but I'm a fan. That said. He appeared in a goodly number of bad movies. War, Crank, Parker... Something like Snatch and Two smoking barrels were (so far) the highlights of his career -- come on, Jason. If that's highlights, you can and should do better. This flick here isn't as bad as War (or Crank or Parker), but it's not great either. Compared to Snatch, it isn't as juicy and has no humour.It starts rather well, actually, with a good amount of valid, non-laughable drama, and (of course) a strong dose of the trademark buttkicking and gunfire (no letdowns on that side). The movie develops well till about a half of it: dialog  and acting are good, and all's very energetic. The cast is ""strong"", and they do as good a job as you expect from them. In an interesting twist, two actresses (Ryder and Bosworth) who usually provide the eye-candy content, here are made up into meth junkies and look awful. I saw Ryder in the titles and could not see where she was on screen. Bosworth, for her part, does a fantastic job portraying a revolting [c-word] on methadone, dirty and ugly; she's so good, you wanna kick her in the teeth. Not that it's important, of course, but these two usual sex kittens are in very unusual roles here. So far so good, but good things would not abide, and towards the middle of the movie things worsen: a goodly number of plot holes appear, the flick becomes predictable (both ""in general"" predictable and ""like 30-secs"" predictable), and people start to shriek like in a bad horror movie. The trend continues, and toward the end the whole affair degenerates into Steven-Segal fare, with the terrifying punisher Stathom going around ripping them all another one, and there being no shadow of doubt that he will succeed, and -- despite a most satisfying, Shakespearean-scale EPIC bloodbath at the end -- the movie becomes boring. Oh yeah, this is, perhaps, unsurprising because of who wrote the script -- Stallone. Yup. The Rambo dramaturgy rears its head.The PC content is present but kept within reasonable limits: only one minority member amongst the main group; he (naturally) is a severely positive, heroic personage; all bad guys are dirty-blond white men (and women), aka ""rednecks"", etc. ""Diversity"" goals' addressed and met, an ideologically naive viewer will come out with a vague distrust of the white species, to which, he will feel, darker minorities are (also vaguely) preferable. But, again, this social-engineering factor is very light here; compared with what _usually_ takes place in Hollywood productions it's almost not worth mentioning.The bottom line: entertaining but forgettable, the flick is slightely above the ""only tolerable"" mark, and is acceptable fare for Statham fans. The rest ought to be careful: this is, emphatically, not Masterpiece Theatre. As a frame of reference, think Straw Dogs (the remake) not Flying over Cuckoo's Nest or 8 1/2. You will _not_ wake up a changed man next day because of having watched Homefront. But neither will you be kicking yourself, though -- provided what you expect is a large helping of bone-crunching and head-butting action by Jason Statham accompanied with severe words of retributive wisdom, delivered in his raspy, slightly accented voice as a stern sendoff to the bad guys when he's about to start them on their WELL DESERVED (haha!) trip to the Land of Shadows.

Set in the smarmy swamplands of the Bayou, a location that adds immensely to the atmosphere of the drama, this is a film that for some reason was overlooked in the theaters (likely a timing release problem). It is full of fine ideas and is brought to life by a very strong cast of well known and not so well known but very competent actors: with Jason Statham at the helm we can be assured it will be a action packed brutal survey of crime and its manifestations.Phil Broker Jason Statham is a former DEA agent who has gone through a crisis after his action against a biker gang went horribly wrong and it cost the life of his boss' son. He is recently widowed and is left with a 9-year-old daughter, Maddy (Izabela Vidovic), and deciding to step out of the dangerous life of a NARC agent he moves to his deceased wife's quit town for Maddy's sake. Maddy draws attention when she has a confrontation with the school bully (Austin Craig) whose parents (Marcus Hester and Kate Bosworth - in a surprisingly fine role) cause trouble setting into motion a series of events that ends in his direct confrontation with the local Meth drug lord Gator (James Franco - excellent!) whose addicted sister happens to be Kate Bosworth. Broker's past history with the biker gang also enters the arena, making matters more complex. But he has a mission in his mind to protect his daughter and he is ready to pay any cost that it demands, despite the fact that the local sheriff (Clancy Brown) is in cahoots with the Meth gang. One of Gator's kind, Cyrus (Frank Grillo) and his girlfriend, the sleazy Sheryl (Winona Rider), are brought into the picture to kill Broker, a kidnapping takes place and an attack on Gator's Meth lab ends in a whale of a combustion that only lights up the surprising final scenes.Yes, this is a rather grisly film about a disturbing subject, but the performances by Statham, Franco, Bosworth, Ryder, Vidovic, Susan Hetch as the school psychologist and love interest, and Grillo are excellent and the supporting cast is rich in terrifying characters portrayed by a fine supporting cast.

He clearly is NOT a run-of-the-mill local yokel in the small Southern hamlet where he and his daughter have settled.* Izabela Vidovic (Lots of TV) is his daughter Maddy, who, miracle of miracles, does NOT trip and fall when being chased, is resourceful and clever, and knows how to stick up for herself.* James Franco (&#34;Oz the Great and Powerful&#34;) is Gator, a down- home bad boy with a hi-tech meth lab that will be his ticket to the big time.* Kate Bosworth (&#34;Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!&#34;) is his sister, furious over that playground incident and dead set on revenge.* Wynona Ryder (&#34;The Iceman&#34;) is Sheryl Mott, a foul-mouthed barmaid; she delivers a file to a powerful man who needs it then she watches the whole violent catastrophe unfold.This has a richly deserved R rating, so expect lots of profanity, broken bones and torture, many intervals of gunfire and drug use along with some highly satisfying blowie uppie stuff.

1688236,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00HEPC0TS,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Over the years, my strategy with Jason Statham films has changed drastically from &#8220;I need to see this&#8221; to &#8220;I&#8217;ll just wait for the movie to be released on DVD/Blu-Ray.&#8221; Although I&#8217;ve always loved the dramatic tension Statham brings to his violent action-thrillers, the movies themselves have become very hit or miss over the past two or three years. This resulted in me being pleasantly surprised with his last film, Redemption, and I found myself singing a similar tune after watching his latest thriller, Homefront. With a solid cast, a surprisingly tender story, and some intense action sequences, Homefront proves itself to be a worthy addition to any fan of Statham&#8217;s work.Phil Broker (Statham) is an ex-DEA agent and ex-soldier. After the passing of his wife, Broker and his daughter, Maddy (Izabela Vidovic), move to Minnesota, where they plan to start fresh. Unfortunately, after Maddy puts the school bully in his place, his parents get furious, and his mother, Cassie (Kate Bosworth), contacts her brother and drug trafficker, Gator (James Franco). What begins as a small family feud soon escalates into more as Broker&#8217;s past demons come back to haunt him, and in their wake is a stream of death and destruction. With a young daughter to think about, Broker must confront these demons while avoiding unnecessary harm to those around him.Although it may not be intentional, a major part of the story revolves around family, and learning to let go of minor differences. From the moment he steps into his new life, Broker is told by multiple people&#8212;including Sheriff Keith Rodrigue (Clancy Brown) and Tito (Omar Benson Miller), Broker&#8217;s friend from work&#8212;that people in town hold grudges. With the loss of his wife, Broker just wants to have a normal, comfortable living with his daughter, but this family and their grudges make his transition difficult. Originally, Gator has nothing against Broker because he doesn&#8217;t know who he is, but he feels obligated to help his sister. I found that this aspect of the narrative provides some unique insight into the human psyche and how we chose to justify our actions.The premise, while simple, manages to make itself so enjoyable because it attempts to bring a more humane element to these extremely violent situations. Similar to Redemption, the narrative never feels like a flimsy set-up used to create just another action film; there are personal differences that manage to get out of hand, and both parties are acting out due to their very different feelings towards their families. Broker is looking out for his family while Gator is acting out because of his. Their motives are different, and this is shown in the way they handle themselves individually and when they&#8217;re together on-screen.Still, a Statham flick wouldn&#8217;t be a Statham flick without some crazy action sequences and some equally crazy schemes, and Homefront isn&#8217;t lacking in either category. Whether Broker is taking down dudes at the gas station, or plotting on Gator&#8217;s safe house, Homefront is intense, it&#8217;s thrilling, and it&#8217;s a pure adrenaline rush. Part of this is accomplished through some extremely eerie music, which was composed by Mark Isham, but Homefront also manages to have some surprisingly solid cinematography, as well. The shaky cam that seems to plague 99% of all action movies is all but absent in here, and if this annoyance was present, I didn&#8217;t notice it. The fight scenes may not have broken new ground, but they were essentially more or less what we&#8217;ve grown to love from Statham.Finally, the performances, while not a major standout of the film, are strong when they needed to be, but they could have been better. Statham himself has characters like Broker down to a science, so he didn&#8217;t really bring anything new to the table. He did excel in certain scenes, but it was more or less the same old same old, unfortunately. Similarly, Izabela Vidovic wasn&#8217;t too impressive either. She managed to pull off a decent Statham impression, but the further you got in the story, the more generic her character became. The real accomplishment, for me, was Mr. James Franco. From his very first scene until the rolling of the credits, Franco was this intimidating, menacing badass, and it was so fun to watch. Every once in a while Franco receives a role that truly exemplifies his ability as an actor, and Gator is one of those roles.Overall Score: 7.9/10 - As an action-thriller, Homefront never breaks any new ground, but that doesn&#8217;t stop it from being a complete blast from start to finish. The somewhat personal narrative is woven perfectly with the action sequences, which allows the film to progress at a nice pace, and its length feels perfect for the story they are trying to tell. There were certain areas that could have been improved, but for what it is, Homefront is worth the time if you&#8217;re a fan of Statham&#8217;s work, or if you want to see James Franco give a stellar performance as Gator.",4,7.9/10 - A fun ride with some surprising depth,1395014400,"03 17, 2014",2014,5137,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.Over', 'years', 'strategy',

While the plot of ex-military/police retired in an out-of-the-way locale who runs into trouble from the past is not new, director Gary Fleder invests the characters in Sylvester Stallone's screenplay with depth and propels the pacing from start to finish.  The star Jason Statham turns in one of his best performances as the widower who loves his daughter and is making a new life for them.  Perhaps the surprise of the movie is Kate Bosworth who has the distinction of having been nominated as Best Actress for a Saturn Award (Science Fiction Academy) and as Worst Actress for a Razzie Award for the same film as Lois Lane in Superman Returns (2006).  She veritably steals the film.  As Cassie Bodine Klum, she is a spitfire tigress bent on backwoods retribution.  She spews insults at everyone in her way.  It is an edgy, last-nerve performance worth the price of the film.  Marcus Hester who plays the supporting role of Cassie's (Bosworth) husband, Jimmy Klum, also turns in a great performance as the backwoods husband who is both bully and coward.  Child actor Austin Craig has a great spin as the chubby bully who picks a fight with the wrong girl on the playground that ignites the fuse of action that follows.  Izabela Vidovic as Statham's daughter Maddy shows range and is a charming presence that warms the film.  James Franco does another bad guy role (reference Spider-Man 3) and combines a lethal smile with a stunning lack of character.  Rachelle Lefevre (Twilight/Under the Dome) adds some romantic potential for Statham.  Omar Benson Miller who was on CSI Miami does a great job as the handyman and loyal friend to Statham.  The deleted scenes on the DVD are interesting to show the director's choices on the final ending edit.  With such a strong cast doing top-level work, Fleder keeps the bar high and lifts this action-packed drama above the cut.

1688290,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00HEPC0TS,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","This Sylvester Stallone scripted mess takes action star Jason Statham on a familiar path as a former DEA agent resettling in his late wife's rural Louisiana homeland.  Phil Broker (Statham) becomes disillusioned when his fellow agents gun down an already shot son of a drug kingpin.  Broker had infiltrated the gang and had set up the bust.  Sitting at home hoping her daddy would come back, I guess, was Broker's 10 year old daughter Maddy (Izabela Vidovic).Broker decides to pull the plug on his career and retire(?)to Louisiana redneck country.  He buys and nice little house off a remote road so that Maddy can ride her horse and fish in a pond.  Well, wouldn't you know, the little town is flush with methamphetamine dealers and the big fish in this little pond is a guy named Gator Bodine (stop laughing).  Gator (James Franco) has the usual cadre of numbskulls working for him.  He's also the supplier to his `Twiggy'-thin tweaker sister, Cassie played by a you-have-to-look-twice Kate Bosworth.When Maddy pummels a bully in the playground, Broker is threatened by the boy's parents who just happened to be Cassie and her Neanderthal hubby Jimmy (Marcus Hester).  That doesn't go so well for Jimmy, so now Broker is a marked man for revenge.  But Broker is no ordinary bloke.  He's...well, he's Jason Statham.  So how do you think this is all going to go down?  Yep, you're right.  Even when Gator calls in the cavalry - a score of biker goons - they are no match for our hero.Don't get me wrong, I actually like Jason Statham and I love to see him kick evil-doer butt, but come on.  Give the guy something to work with.  Finally, I got a chuckle out of seeing poor Winona Ryder play a strung out biker slut and sometime Gator plaything.  Brother.  I suspect this film will have some appeal to Statham fans, no matter how bad the movie is, so watch it, if you must, on Blu ray.The video is in 1080p resolution and has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The transfer is pretty impressive.  Colors are warm and slightly muted for most of the scenes.  Skintone appear accurate.  You can see minimal variation, scene to scene.  A very nice picture.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is excellent.  You might want to watch your volume from the opening scene.  It is very loud and it shut down my not quite warmed up amp trying to save my speakers.  The movie isn't all shootouts and bar fights however.  There are quiet moments between Broker and Maddy that are clear and distinct.  The surrounds are often brought into play, especially during the action sequences.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, Spanish and French.  Extras are few; some deleted scenes, an extended ending and a promo.",2,(BLU RAY REVIEW) Jason Statham can't save this poorly scripted flick,1405900800,"07 21, 2014",2014,2688,"['Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'scripted', 'mess', 'action', 'star', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'familiar', 'path', 'former', 'DEA', 'agent', 'resettling', 'late', 'wife', 'rural', 'Louisiana', 'homeland', 'Phil', 'Broker', 'Statham', 'becomes', 'disillusioned', 'when', 'fellow', 'agents', 'gun', 'down', 'already', 'shot', 'son', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'Broker', 'had', 'infiltrated', 'gang', 'had', 'set', 'up', 'bust', 'Sitting', 'home', 'hoping', 'daddy', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'guess', 'was', 'Broker', '10', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Maddy', 'Izabela', 'Vidovic', '.Broker', 'pull', 'plug', 'career', 'retire', 'Louisiana', 'redneck', 'country', 'nice', 'little', 'house', 'remote', 'road', 'Maddy', 'can', 'ride', 'horse', 'fish', 'pond', 'Well', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'little', 'town', 'flush', 'methamphetamine', 'dealers', 'big', 'fish', 'little', 'pond', 'guy', 'named', 'Gator', 'Bodine', 'stop', 'laughing', 'Gator', 'James', 'Franco', 'usual', 'cadre', 'numbskulls', 'working', 'also', 'supplier', ""Twiggy'-thin"", 'tweaker', 'sister', 'Cassie', 'played', 'you-have-to-look-twice', 'Kate', 'Bosworth.When', 'Maddy', 'bully', 'playground', 'Broker', 'threatened', 'boy', 'parents', 'who', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'Cassie', 'Neanderthal', 'hubby', 'Jimmy', 'Marcus', 'Hester', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'well', 'Jimmy', 'so', 'now', 'Broker', 'marked', 'man', 'revenge', 'Broker', 'ordinary', 'bloke', 'well', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'So', 'how', 'do', 'think', 'going', 'go', 'down', 'Yep', ""'re"", 'right', 'Even', 'when', 'Gator', 'cavalry', 'score', 'biker', 'goons', 'are', 'match', 'hero.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'actually', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'love', 'see', 'kick', 'evil-doer', 'butt', 'come', 'Give', 'guy', 'something', 'work', 'Finally', 'got', 'chuckle', 'seeing', 'poor', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'play', 'strung', 'out', 'biker', 'slut', 'sometime', 'Gator', 'plaything', 'Brother', 'suspect', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'appeal', 'Statham', 'fans', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'so', 'watch', 'must', 'Blu', 'ray.The', 'video', '1080p', 'resolution', '2.40:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'transfer', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'Colors', 'are', 'warm', 'slightly', 'muted', 'most', 'scenes', 'Skintone', 'appear', 'accurate', 'can', 'see', 'minimal', 'variation', 'scene', 'scene', 'very', 'nice', 'picture', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'excellent', 'might', 'want', 'watch', 'volume', 'opening', 'scene', 'very', 'loud', 'shut', 'down', 'not', 'quite', 'warmed', 'up', 'amp', 'trying', 'save', 'speakers', 'movie', ""n't"", 'shootouts', 'bar', 'fights', 'however', 'are', 'quiet', 'moments', 'Broker', 'Maddy', 'are', 'clear', 'distinct', 'surrounds', 'are', 'often', 'brought', 'play', 'especially', 'action', 'sequences', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'English', 'SDH', 'Spanish', 'French', 'Extras', 'are', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'extended', 'ending', 'promo']",N/A

The drug-baron's son dies in the firing and in true Bollywood style, the drug baron threatens to kill Statham.We then see Statham's daughter in an idyllic, all-American Town confronting a school bully and breaking his nose.

Statham is a former undercover cop trying to escape his past and is a recently widowed father protecting his cute daughter (who knows some wicked hand-to-hand combat moves). Relocated to a remote Louisiana town, Statham is besieged by circumstance with the uncanny reappearance of the bad guys.  A new local bad guy is James Franco, who impressed me with the enormity of his badness glands. He is cooking meth to sell & also supplying his strung-out sister. Enter Ryder, lover of Franco, who just happens to be connected to Statham's former nemesis who is still in jail.Statham's stature is so small that he is barely bigger than his daughter. This combined with his chronic sinus issues makes him a less than credible adversary to big, bad fighting guys. He takes them down - fast - when, in reality, they could lift him off his feet with one arm.I disliked the movie overall due to its hackneyed storyline. When the name of Franco's character, Gator Bodine, was first mentioned, the first thing that popped into my head was Jethro from the Beverly Hillbillies TV show thereby diminishing the fearsomeness of his character by numerous degrees.  I appreciated Franco's versatility as an actor to play a credible bad guy, despite the unfortunate name, and Kate Bosworth does a fantastic job as his strung-out, confrontational sister.

More times than not it seemed like he was going through the motions.But the plot and editing being what it was,nicely glossed over any weaknesses.Winona Ryder plays the drug dealers moll/girlfriend.I didn't even recognize her right off and cannot say I was particularly impressed by her acting at all.Finally I must mention Clancy Brown's nice turn as the town sheriff.Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras,which I thought was somewhat of a cheat.I'm sure there must be some interview material with Mr.Stallone and Statham somewhere that could have been included.All in all a nice dramatic piece.It is full of action and tension and Mr Stallone has written a nice screenplay,tailor made for its star.",4,Nice made-for

We all know that at this point, Jason Statham is the best Action star you could have, but the jury was out on how effect he could be in a more dramatic role. In Home Front, Statham plays a retired undercover D.E.A. agent, who has recently become a single father. He and his daughter have moved from the big city to the small town, which his late wife called home, in the hopes of building a better life. Everything was going as planned until his daughter, stood up to a bully at school, and embarrassed the son of one the towns most influential families. The simple misunderstanding between children quickly escalates into an all out war, which will force Statham to use everything he learned in the D.E.A. to protect his daughter and his new home. Once again, Jason Statham was terrific in this film. It is mind boggling and seems to be impossible, but every film this man does is better than the one before it. He is on a winning streak, the likes of which I have never seen. Statham was terrific, but oddly, he's paired with an actor who doesn't have much experience playing the bad guy and it showed. James Franco plays Gator Bodine, a small time hood and drug trafficker, who goes after Statham with everything he's got, the only problem is, Bodine really isn't that bad a guy. In fact, when Franco starts cursing and playing all tough, it's almost laughable, not to mention the fact that he doesn't have a tenth of the fighting skills that Statham has. Being that this was a big budget film, Written by Sylvester Stallone (Rocky),  Directed by Gary Fleder (Kiss The Girls, Runaway Jury), and starting the best action star in the game (Jason Statham), it's very peculiar that they would choose a bad guy, who is best known as a comedic actor. While the story was great, Franco simply can not match up with Statham at all. Homefront has almost everything you could want in a Thriller, but the lack of a strong, believable opponent, really calls into question just how believable the film is and makes it somewhat predictable.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,2205,"['When', 'combine', 'Action', 'Drama', 'had', 'better', 'have', 'damn', 'good', 'story', 'go', 'along', 'tremendous', 'fight', 'scenes', 'wild', 'chases', 'else', 'get', 'film', 'flat', 'know', 'point', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'best', 'Action', 'star', 'could', 'have', 'jury', 'was', 'out', 'how', 'effect', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'dramatic', 'role', 'Home', 'Front', 'Statham', 'retired', 'undercover', 'D.E.A', 'agent', 'who', 'recently', 'become', 'single', 'father', 'daughter', 'have', 'moved', 'big', 'city', 'small', 'town', 'late', 'wife', 'called', 'home', 'hopes', 'building', 'better', 'life', 'Everything', 'was', 'going', 'planned', 'daughter', 'stood', 'up', 'bully', 'school', 'embarrassed', 'son', 'one', 'towns', 'most', 'influential', 'families', 'simple', 'misunderstanding', 'children', 'quickly', 'out', 'war', 'will', 'force', 'Statham', 'use', 'everything', 'learned', 'D.E.A', 'protect', 'daughter', 'new', 'home', 'Once', 'again', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'was', 'terrific', 'film', 'mind', 'boggling', 'be', 'impossible', 'film', 'man', 'better', 'one', 'winning', 'streak', 'likes', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Statham', 'was', 'terrific', 'oddly', 'paired', 'actor', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'experience', 'playing', 'bad', 'guy', 'showed', 'James', 'Franco', 'Gator', 'Bodine', 'small', 'time', 'hood', 'drug', 'trafficker', 'who', 'Statham', 'everything', 'got', 'only', 'problem', 'Bodine', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'guy', 'fact', 'when', 'Franco', 'cursing', 'playing', 'tough', 'almost', 'laughable', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', ""n't"", 'have', 'tenth', 'fighting', 'skills', 'Statham', 'Being', 'was', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'Written', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Rocky', 'Directed', 'Gary', 'Fleder', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'Runaway', 'Jury', 'starting', 'best', 'action', 'star', 'game', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'very', 'peculiar', 'would', 'choose', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'comedic', 'actor', 'story', 'was', 'great', 'Franco', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'match', 'up', 'Statham', 'Homefront', 'almost', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'Thriller', 'lack', 'strong', 'believable', 'opponent', 'really', 'question', 'just', 'how', 'believable', 'film', 'somewhat', 'predictable']",N/A

1688386,AM7FRM994GYOJ,B00HEPC0TS,Tyler,"[0, 0]","..and he wrote a pretty good one. Jason Statham was great, as always. As a matter of fact I think he continues to become a better actor, far beyond the MMA stylistics he is known for; reminds me of how good he was in Lock, Stock (1998!, so long ago..). To that point, it is clear that writing makes an enormous difference. Statham shows up, regardless of the script, but in this case he was able to shine a bit more brightly - the writing here was quote good. He may well have a great older-gentleman career ahead, ala Michael Caine. Sure, it's a ways off, but with movies like this he serves himself, and his fans quite well.There were some holes here and there, such as the complete absence of an alarm in the house of someone under witsec protection, or a former deep-cover DEA agent trying to live a &#34;normal&#34; life. Overall this movie was solid, including some very, very good acting by Kate Bosworth. Winona Rider turned out some great scenes as well (good to see her, it's been a while). James Franco played his character very well; not being from the deep-south-along-the-bayou myself, I have no idea of accuracy, but he definitely nailed the stereotype. Regarding stereotypes, it was nice to see the sheriff's character fully redeemed at the end*. Early on we were led to believe he was corrupt and would side with the locals, but slowly his true nature revealed (the dumping of the whiskey poured by Franco). Ultimately good triumphed! Also good to see was the commonplace love-story angle placed on the back-burner. The school psychologist seemed likely to have a bigger role, maybe protecting or watching the daughter. Rather than go that way the story stuck to the main plot points; credit due to Stallone, thus the title of this review. Good stuff!*the sheriff's redemption here reminded me of 'First Blood' (1982) - wow, has Stallone had a great career, with the original Rocky from 1976 - also his script, and his huge breakout role. He actually started, so says iMDb, in 1970. That's, well, let's see here, carry the one - that works out to 44-years (and counting)! Wait, is that right?! Despite this review, I am not his biggest fan, not even close. But wow, you have to respect all of the work he has done.",4,Screenplay by Sylvester Stallone...

You've read the other reviews so the plot is somewhat revealed but it doesn't relieve the pressure cooker intensity of this fabulous action thriller.  Directed by Gary Fleder who honed his craft on such up and coming titles as 'KISS THE GIRLS'-1997 and 'RUNAWAY JURY'-2003 piles on the ominous atmosphere with great set pieces. It also helps that he has a great ensemble of actors along for the ride.  James Franco plays his villainous Gator Bodine role as an intelligent misfit surrounded by a den of backwoods denizens under his drug controlled empire unfortunately the great Clancy Brown has very little to do as the sheriff on the take.  Although Jason Statham is front and center , the excellent screenplay by Sylvester Stallone based on a novel by Chuck Logan lets the female roles outshine the proceedings:  Winona Ryder is wonderful as Franco's motorcycle mama partner looking like she just walked off the set of Kurt Sutter's 'SONS OF ANARCHY'; Kate Bosworth emerges as the films scene stealer as Franco's cokehead sister who sets the plot in motion and unfortunately, Rachelle Lefevre who is shining on the Stephen King television hit 'UNDER THE DOME' goes the way of Clancy Brown as having very little to do as a possible love interest for Statham.  It is Jason's show all the way and thankfully the photography by Theo Van De Sande plays up the snap/crackle violence when it erupts. The Blu-ray is presented in a flawless 1080P widescreen transfer  although skimpy on the extras department with a 3 minute(?) behind the scenes blink or you'll miss spot and  a theatrical trailer plus trailers for other Universal releases.

1688395,A2ZHSORK1HHYTT,B00HEPC0TS,Willy D. Reviewer,"[3, 11]","I can't believe I'm the first to give it only One Star.  This film is really not a &#34;thriller&#34; and the &#34;action&#34; scenes are second rate.Here are the surprises in the movie:(1) Sylvester Stallone wrote the script, and was one of the producers, and is personal friends with Jason Statham. So how could this be such a bad movie?  (See below.)(2) The plot holes are big enough to drive a redneck double wide through.  First, Statham is an undercover NARC who decides to go into witness protection in Louisianan?  In a town where everyone is suspicious of all &#34;outsiders&#34;?  And where a major drug operation going on?  Did no one in the DEA do research on this town?Second, Statham buys a fixer-upper, but doesn't have the sense to put video cameras and motion detectors around the property?  With today's high tech, as soon as some one stepped foot on his property his IPad would have buzzed and he would instantly see who it is.  This is a no brainier.Third, who goes off and does not lock their front door?  And not have an internal alarm system with a 160 decibel blaster?  Nope, the bad guy just walks in the open front door and takes his time searching the place.NOW HERE IS THE REALLY BIG PLOT CRAPOLA:  Forth: This NARC (Statham), who is in hiding, has take his files with him! I mean the files that are used in prosecuting the drug lord he busted -- and he also took his undercover file!  Pictures and all!  And guess where they are?  In the basement in cardboard boxes!  That's right, not in a safe, not hidden behind a wall, but right out in the open in the basement.  Of course the bad guy goes through the unlocked top secret boxes and discovers the real identity of Statham.  Duh.(3) Poor Winona Ryder.  She is given first female billing, but she is really third.  What happened to her career?  She must have been desperate for cash to take this role.(4) And what happened to Kate Bosworth?  She is unrecognizable.  She needs to eat a few Big Macs and drink about 6 milk shakes a day.  She is so skinny that she has no breasts.  Maybe that's why she gives a hysterical performance.(5) James Franco plays James Franco -- that's no surprise.  He plays the same person, with different dialog, in every movie.  And it seems he makes about 12 movies a year.  In this movie, you just don't buy the fact that he is a big time -- super dangerous -- drug manufacturer in the redneck south.  He's a small skinny guy that Statham could lightly bitch slap and that would be the end of it.  Very poor casting choice.(6) Jason Statham: If you are looking for the Statham in the Transporter series, he's not here.  There are no great choreographed action scenes where he takes on 6 to 10 bad guys.  He can barely handle 3 out of shape rednecks who have no martial arts skills.  And the ending is just stupid.  No tension, no excitement.

1688401,A1S1BJFTA644TU,B00HEPC0TS,Zalmorion the Fantastic,"[1, 1]","Yes, there are a few flaws, but this movie is entertaining until the very end.  No slow spots.  No corny dialogue.  No forced comedy, like you see in a lot of action flops these days.The daughter is not annoying or stupidly cute--just the opposite!  She is a character worth following.  She's believable, and that is refreshing.  Great new actress.There is a pleasant hint of a love interest between our hero and his kid's psychologist, but no subplot that ruins everything with forced emotions and gratuitous sex just so the writers can create another pawn for the bad guys to kidnap, beat, kill, etc.  That lazy trope is avoided here.  In fact, since a relationship is hinted at, you often wonder if she is a plant for the bad guys.This movie builds and builds and builds!  The tension hikes up logically and tragically.  The action is never over the top.  Every fight is realistic.  Every explosion is inventively induced.The acting is superb.  Statham is an action superhero, of course, but his acting is top notch in this flick.  Frank Grillo and James Franco are two very different villains that get thrown into this mix, making for an exciting and unpredictable plot.  All because of one woman's lack of parenting skills and backwoods ignorance (Kate Bosworth plays the part perfectly).  Grillo is a frightening psycho.  Franco is a thoughtful, almost likable scumbag.The characters change in this movie and/or they are portrayed with just enough depth that they feel realistic.  James Franco plays a more down-to-earth villain who you could definitely run into these days.  His humanity pops in and out of scenes, which is a nice touch.  His sister grows as a person.  Ryder's junkie ho is also teetering on the verge of humanity.  Believably.The flaws?  Well, you might not agree, but . . .1) James Franco vs. Jason Statham.  The final &#34;battle&#34; is kind of a letdown.  You hear so much about Franco's reputation.  It kind of felt like Robin fighting Thor.  Although, again, his character's depth is revealed.2) The accents.  The movie can't decide if Statham's character is from Australia.  It reminds me of when they used to screw up films starring Arnold.  Likewise, Franco loses the southern accent often.  If you are portraying Southerners, keep the proper accent.  Only Statham's character's work buddy and the town sheriff keep it accurate the entire movie.3) Long-haired Statham.  It looks so fake that I am pretty sure any MC would laugh and throw beer kegs at him.  They could have done him up better, grown out a beard, anything!  Keep him bald with a beard.  One tug on that shaggy toupee in a bar brawl and his cover is GONE.4) Chuck Zito.  I am surprised at how much better an actor this guy is becoming.  What few may know is that he is a real deal Hell's Angel with PROBABLY a LOT of criminal experience.  He knocked out Jean Claude Van Damme in a night club.  He is a tough, frightening guy.  Why not use Zito in an epic fight scene!?!  He is a hulk of a guy with a REAL background in violence you and I can only imagine.So . . . SEE THIS MOVIE NOW.  Is it worth buying?  Yeah, if you love Statham or action films with some thought put into them.
