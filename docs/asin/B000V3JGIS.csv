1098407,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000V3JGIS,calvinnme,"[160, 164]","The Addams Family TV show was based on a series of cartoons started back in the 1930's and authored by Charles Addams for the New Yorker. Whether or not Addams intended for there to be some kind of Depression-era message on the idle rich being scary in more ways than one I do not know, but it does seem like that is one of the messages trying to come through all the dark humor. What I do know is that a show this offbeat and creative would never get aired on network TV today, and even if it did, the minute it got successful the network suits would start tinkering with it and ruin it. If you need an example of this phenomena, I point you in the direction of Lost.The Addams' are portrayed as a close knit and happy family - in fact they rarely have contact with outsiders other than the children attending school. They appear completely human, but they eat food that seems completely inedible by any normal human being and they each have their own peculiar qualities that seem beyond those of normal humans such as Uncle Fester's ability to generate electricity. If they do have visitors, they are usually other family members from some remote area who display these same characteristics. The show never explains the origin of the Addams' or their great wealth - that's just part of their intrigue. There are a few episodes here and there that reference  popular culture as it existed then such as ""Lurch the Teenage Idol"" which pokes fun of the early Beatles and similar rock bands of the time. For the most part, though, the show is pretty much timeless and thus is still funny today.all 64 episodes are spread across 9 double-sided discs in this set. Episodes are presented in Full Frame with English, French and Spanish audio and English and Spanish subtitles. The specific list of extra features include:Audio commentary for ""The Addams Family Goes To School"", ""Morticia, The Matchmaker"" and ""Cousin Itt Visits The Addams Family"" featuring cast members Lisa Loring, Ken Weatherwax and Felix Silla with ""The Addams Chronicles"" author Stephen Cox and director Arthur Hiller.Thing and Cousin Itt select scene commentary on ""Thing is Missing"", ""My Son, the Chimp"", ""Cousin Itt and the Vocational Counsellor"", ""My Fair Cousin Itt"" ""Morticia's Dilemma"", ""Ophelia Finds Romance"" and ""Lurch's Little Helper"".Commentary by Steven Cox, author of ""The Addams Chronicles"" on ""Morticia Meets Royalty"" and ""Morticia the Decorator"".Tombstone Trivia on ""Morticia's Romance"" (Part I) and ""Cat Addams"".""You Rang, Mr. Addams"" - featurette""Snap, Snap"" - featurette""The Addams Family Portrait"" featurette including on-camera interviews with John Astin.""Mad About The Addams"" featurette""Guest Star S&eacute;ance"" with Parley Baer, Milton Frome, Vito Scotti, Elizabeth Fraser, Richard Deacon, Sig Ruman, Margaret Hamilton, Elvia Allman, Eddie Quillan and Peter Bonerz.Theme Song KaraokeStill galleries featuring original drawings and photos",5,The quirkiness of this show keeps it funny and timeless,1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,2927,"['Addams', 'Family', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'based', 'series', 'cartoons', 'started', 'back', '1930', 'authored', 'Charles', 'Addams', 'New', 'Yorker', 'Whether', 'not', 'Addams', 'intended', 'be', 'kind', 'Depression-era', 'message', 'idle', 'rich', 'being', 'scary', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'seem', 'one', 'messages', 'trying', 'come', 'dark', 'humor', 'What', 'do', 'know', 'show', 'offbeat', 'creative', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'aired', 'network', 'TV', 'today', 'even', 'did', 'minute', 'got', 'successful', 'network', 'suits', 'would', 'start', 'tinkering', 'ruin', 'need', 'example', 'phenomena', 'point', 'direction', 'Lost.The', 'Addams', 'are', 'portrayed', 'close', 'knit', 'happy', 'family', 'fact', 'rarely', 'have', 'contact', 'outsiders', 'other', 'children', 'attending', 'school', 'appear', 'completely', 'human', 'eat', 'food', 'completely', 'inedible', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'have', 'own', 'peculiar', 'qualities', 'seem', 'normal', 'humans', 'such', 'Uncle', 'Fester', 'ability', 'generate', 'electricity', 'do', 'have', 'visitors', 'are', 'usually', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'remote', 'area', 'who', 'display', 'same', 'characteristics', 'show', 'never', 'origin', 'Addams', 'great', 'wealth', 'just', 'part', 'intrigue', 'are', 'few', 'episodes', 'here', 'there', 'reference', 'popular', 'culture', 'existed', 'then', 'such', 'Lurch', 'Teenage', 'Idol', 'fun', 'early', 'Beatles', 'similar', 'rock', 'bands', 'time', 'most', 'part', 'though', 'show', 'pretty', 'much', 'timeless', 'thus', 'still', 'funny', 'today.all', '64', 'episodes', 'are', 'spread', '9', 'double-sided', 'discs', 'set', 'Episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'Full', 'Frame', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'audio', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'specific', 'list', 'extra', 'features', 'include', 'Audio', 'commentary', 'Addams', 'Family', 'Goes', 'School', 'Morticia', 'Matchmaker', 'Cousin', 'Itt', 'Addams', 'Family', 'featuring', 'cast', 'members', 'Lisa', 'Loring', 'Ken', 'Weatherwax', 'Felix', 'Silla', 'Addams', 'Chronicles', 'author', 'Stephen', 'Cox', 'director', 'Arthur', 'Hiller.Thing', 'Cousin', 'Itt', 'select', 'scene', 'commentary', 'Thing', 'Missing', 'Son', 'Chimp', 'Cousin', 'Itt', 'Vocational', 'Counsellor', 'Fair', 'Cousin', 'Itt', 'Morticia', 'Dilemma', 'Ophelia', 'Finds', 'Romance', 'Lurch', 'Little', 'Helper', '.Commentary', 'Steven', 'Cox', 'author', 'Addams', 'Chronicles', 'Morticia', 'Meets', 'Royalty', 'Morticia', 'Decorator', '.Tombstone', 'Trivia', 'Morticia', 'Romance', 'Part', 'Cat', 'Addams', 'Rang', 'Mr.', 'Addams', 'featurette', 'Snap', 'Snap', 'featurette', 'Addams', 'Family', 'Portrait', 'featurette', 'including', 'on-camera', 'interviews', 'John', 'Astin', 'Mad', 'Addams', 'featurette', 'Guest', 'Star', 'S', 'eacute', 'ance', 'Parley', 'Baer', 'Milton', 'Frome', 'Vito', 'Scotti', 'Elizabeth', 'Fraser', 'Richard', 'Deacon', 'Sig', 'Ruman', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'Elvia', 'Allman', 'Eddie', 'Quillan', 'Peter', 'Bonerz.Theme', 'Song', 'KaraokeStill', 'featuring', 'original', 'drawings', 'photos']",The Addams Family - The Complete Series

Because the viewer is constantly being reminded that what they are watching is funny, the comedy becomes less real and consequently less funny. If The Addams Family had dispensed with its laugh track it would have been much funnier and acclaimed as a great social satire; instead, it's a tolerably amusing old tv show with boorish canned sniggering. The Complete Series doesn't add much to the mix, either. The sound and image is good quality, but there are few worthy extras on the discs: a handful of meandering, pointless commentaries about trivia usually unrelated to the episode in question and, especially, a really bad featurette of supporting players' careers which is ghastly in execution and insulting to the actors.

1098415,A239PPUVV8O0U0,B000V3JGIS,D. A. Reed,"[2, 2]","Note: I meant to put this with my Wonder Woman review but I forgot (regarding if this one posts before that). Instead of reviewing each season of a particular series and feel like I'm repeating myself in terms of praise or criticism, I'll just be reviewing the complete collection and give my thoughts on the series as a whole instead of the individual season releases.The Addams Family has always been one of my favorites, whether it be the movies (except Reunion, I only saw that once and can't really remember much about it), animated incarnations (except the 1973 series which I never saw) or television remakes. And since I was exposed to them first, I prefer them to The Munsters (expect me to make comparisons but remember its only my opinion so don't hate me for it). I'm sure there's people who saw the Addams first and still like the other or vice versa but that's just the way I am (much like my view on Bewitched and Jeannie though both are good).First off, the actors. While there are quite a few episodes that feature the entire family, most episodes feature Gomez, Morticia, Uncle Fester, Lurch, Thing and later Cousin Itt. John Astin, though not Spanish like Raul Julia in the film, plays Gomez with a thirst for life. He's energetic, passionate to his wife (rarely, if never, seen between spouses on television. The only examples of husbands and wives showing emotion to eachother are Lucy & Ricky  and Samantha & Darrin [mainly when Dick York played the role]) and loves his family. Carolyn Jones as Morticia, again displays many of the qualities I see in Astin. Though Morticia is clearly the head of the family and adores her husband (the way she turns Gomez on at the drop of a hat whenever she speaks French astounds me). Jones and Astin had a chemistry that you don't see nowadays. Like York and Montgomery from Bewitched, this is a rare chemistry that is displayed by actors, mainly by actors who aren't married or in a relationship with actor that's playing the significant other is when its most believable. Rarely has it been displayed by actors who were married, such as Lucy and Desi. They were also a more believable couple than Lily and Herman (not saying the actors who played were bad), who suffered from the same thing that other sitcoms with married couples had. I also don't get why the general public feared the Addams family though they looked normal, while the Munsters were at least accepted but people were still scared of them yet were technically the Universal Monsters domesticated. Anyway back to the Addams. Lisa Loring and Ken Weatherwax play Wednesday and Pugsley, not as how they're done nowadays in the films and cartoons, but more or less as a brother and sister who have macabre tastes. A shame that more episodes weren't devoted to them as they're good actors (wow, I can't believe I found child actors that're...good!) but thems the brakes with the labor laws. Jackie Coogan is hilarious as Uncle Fester, making me crack up everytime he says ""I'll shoot 'im in the back!"". Blossom Rock as Grandmama is good in her own right, but like the children, most episodes don't feature her by having the character off-screen doing stuff with the children. Ted Cassidy is funny as Lurch, with his classic line ""You Rang"" along with some great facial expressions. Thing (played by Cassidy or, if Lurch and Thing featured in the same scene, by a production assistant), can equally be funny and surprisingly (for a hand) has more episodes given to him over the children or Mama. And last there's Cousin Itt. He's a walking pile of hair that makes high-pitched sounds more pleasing to the ear than the actual dialog from the Chipmunks. There are a few other relatives or recurring characters (Jones as Morticia's sister Ophelia, Margaret Hamilton as Morticia's mother), Sam Hilliard (who goes from one occupation to another thanks to the family) but they're really not worth mentioning as they rarely show up.The dialog and writing is witty, thanks mainly to Nat Perrin, who had worked with the Marx Bros., making the humor in this a little more sophisticated than The Munsters, in which the comedy always felt forced. Both seasons were consistent in the quality of writing, direction and acting, never straining from what they established with their first episode. Favorite episodes would be the two-part Morticia's Romance (which includes my favorite exchange between Morticia and Gomez), Amnesia in the Addams Family, The Addams Family Meets the Spacemen/VIPS, Happy Birthday Granny Frump and many others. The effects were decent but I don't think there was a big budget in that department. The shot of Gomez's wrecked trains was shot for the first episode then used when needed. A couple other shots might be stock as well but aren't as noticeable. A great series that was canceled before its time. Granted it would've been weird to see it in color but at least they would've been regularly colored when compared to the Munsters' movie(s) (not sure if there were two or not) where everybody was green. But to the show's defense, it and the Addams Family had good ratings before they were yanked off the air and I don't think there's every been a good reason for it either.",5,"Snap,

1098419,A105D0UKK3356E,B000V3JGIS,Dunestar,"[26, 28]","Originally, I knew the Addams Family not from the television series, but from their first animated series.  Many know the Addams Family spawned from drawings and characters created by Charles Addams for the New Yorker.The Addams Family appeared like your average, eccentric rich family.  Except for the fact, they lived in an old mansion containing trapdoors, a lab, torture chamber and dungeon.  Had pets like a live lion, vulture and African Strangler, and a disembodied hand as sort of a relation.Gomez Addams was the cigar-smoking, fencing, always nimble head of the household, while Morticia tended to her garden, fed her plants, and made sure everything ran smoothly in the house.  Next was Lurch, their zombiesque butler who would appear out of nowhere whenever the noose gong was pulled.He'd come in and claim, 'You rang?'  Then you had Uncle Fester, who mysteriously kept an electric charge through his body, had a penchant for explosives, and kept a vulture in the house.  Grandma-ma who loved casting spells, fortune telling, and cooking the occasional spider, snakes and bat-shaped cookies for her grandchildren, Wednesday and Puggsley Addams.Unlike their film counterparts, Wednesday and Puggsley were actually nice kids with some odd habits of having pet spiders and octopi, and liking things like wild gorillas and such.  Wednesday even carried around her headless doll, Marie Antoinette.Besides the standard brood, the Addamses' relations were not exactly normal either:  Grandma Frump (Morticia's mother, played by Margaret Hamilton - aka Wicked Witch of the West) who originally wanted Gomez to marry Morticia's 'flowery' twin sister, Ophelia (played by Carolyn Jones as well).  Then you had Cousin Itt, the dark-glasses, derby-wearing, living hair.Now the strange thing was, overlooking their macabre and gruesome environment, the Addams Family was far from evil or sinister.  They simply viewed things differently than what the average person might view them.For instance, in ""The Addams Family Goes to School,"" Wednesday comes home crying because in 'Grim's Fairly Tales,' she learns things like dragons, witches, and ogres are slain by 'horrible' knights, children, and warriors.  Naturally, Gomez and Morticia go to complain about their children being exposed to such 'violence.'  Reluctantly the school truant complies, stating he'll make certain 'violence will be abolished' in the school.Besides the hilarity though, the Addams Family did demonstrate it was better accepting people for whom they are than to change them.  In ""The Addams Family Meets a Beatnik,""  the family rescue a beatnik who has just crashed his motorcycle on their property.At first, ""Rocky"" reacts to the Addamses as most people would.  Rather than being adversed to Rocky's beatnik behaviour, they become fascinated with his speech and manor.  They even throw him a surprise birthday party as well.  Meanwhile Gomez and Morticia discover Rocky's true identity of being the heir to a business tycoon.  Except what they don't realize is, Rocky and his Dad don't see eye-to-eye on things.It isn't until after the Addams brings them together, Rocky and his Dad learn they have to accept each other for who they are, not what they want them to be.Overall, the timelessness about the Addams Family is they live carefree, and enjoy their way of life, accepting everyone and everything around them.  Even when most people have a hard time accepting them.The collection is great for those who fondly remember Gomez and Morticia, and definitely wonderful for the next generation who might wonder why we loved shows about an odd family living in an old house.Although still creepy and spooky, and altogether ooky, we still love the Addams Family.",5,"Still creepy and spooky, and altogether ooky...",1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,3734,"['Originally', 'knew', 'Addams', 'Family', 'not', 'television', 'series', 'first', 'animated', 'series', 'Many', 'know', 'Addams', 'Family', 'spawned', 'drawings', 'characters', 'created', 'Charles', 'Addams', 'New', 'Yorker.The', 'Addams', 'Family', 'appeared', 'average', 'eccentric', 'rich', 'family', 'fact', 'lived', 'old', 'mansion', 'containing', 'trapdoors', 'lab', 'torture', 'chamber', 'dungeon', 'Had', 'pets', 'live', 'lion', 'vulture', 'African', 'Strangler', 'disembodied', 'hand', 'sort', 'relation.Gomez', 'Addams', 'was', 'cigar-smoking', 'fencing', 'always', 'nimble', 'head', 'household', 'Morticia', 'tended', 'garden', 'fed', 'plants', 'made', 'sure', 'everything', 'ran', 'smoothly', 'house', 'Next', 'was', 'Lurch', 'zombiesque', 'butler', 'who', 'would', 'appear', 'nowhere', 'whenever', 'noose', 'gong', 'was', 'pulled.He', ""'d"", 'come', 'claim', 'rang', 'Then', 'had', 'Uncle', 'Fester', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'kept', 'electric', 'charge', 'body', 'had', 'penchant', 'explosives', 'kept', 'vulture', 'house', 'Grandma-ma', 'who', 'loved', 'casting', 'spells', 'fortune', 'telling', 'cooking', 'occasional', 'spider', 'snakes', 'bat-shaped', 'cookies', 'grandchildren', 'Wednesday', 'Puggsley', 'Addams.Unlike', 'film', 'counterparts', 'Wednesday', 'Puggsley', 'were', 'actually', 'nice', 'kids', 'odd', 'habits', 'having', 'pet', 'spiders', 'octopi', 'liking', 'things', 'wild', 'gorillas', 'such', 'Wednesday', 'even', 'carried', 'headless', 'doll', 'Marie', 'Antoinette.Besides', 'standard', 'brood', 'Addamses', 'relations', 'were', 'not', 'exactly', 'normal', 'Grandma', 'Frump', 'Morticia', 'mother', 'played', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'aka', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'who', 'originally', 'wanted', 'Gomez', 'marry', 'Morticia', ""'flowery"", 'twin', 'sister', 'Ophelia', 'played', 'Carolyn', 'Jones', 'as', 'well', 'Then', 'had', 'Cousin', 'Itt', 'dark-glasses', 'derby-wearing', 'living', 'strange', 'thing', 'was', 'overlooking', 'macabre', 'gruesome', 'environment', 'Addams', 'Family', 'was', 'far', 'evil', 'sinister', 'simply', 'viewed', 'things', 'differently', 'what', 'average', 'person', 'might', 'view', 'them.For', 'instance', 'Addams', 'Family', 'Goes', 'School', 'Wednesday', 'home', 'crying', ""'Grim"", 'Fairly', 'Tales', 'things', 'dragons', 'witches', 'ogres', 'are', 'slain', ""'horrible"", 'knights', 'children', 'warriors', 'Naturally', 'Gomez', 'Morticia', 'go', 'complain', 'children', 'being', 'exposed', 'such', ""'violence"", 'Reluctantly', 'school', 'truant', 'complies', 'stating', ""'ll"", 'make', 'certain', ""'violence"", 'will', 'be', 'abolished', 'school.Besides', 'hilarity', 'Addams', 'Family', 'did', 'demonstrate', 'was', 'better', 'accepting', 'people', 'whom', 'are', 'change', 'Addams', 'Family', 'Beatnik', 'family', 'beatnik', 'who', 'just', 'crashed', 'motorcycle', 'property.At', 'first', 'Rocky', 'reacts', 'Addamses', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'Rather', 'being', 'adversed', 'Rocky', 'beatnik', 'behaviour', 'become', 'fascinated', 'speech', 'manor', 'even', 'throw', 'surprise', 'birthday', 'party', 'as', 'well', 'Meanwhile', 'Gomez', 'Morticia', 'discover', 'Rocky', 'true', 'identity', 'being', 'heir', 'business', 'tycoon', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Rocky', 'Dad', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'eye-to-eye', 'things.It', ""n't"", 'Addams', 'together', 'Rocky', 'Dad', 'learn', 'have', 'accept', 'other', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'want', 'be.Overall', 'timelessness', 'Addams', 'Family', 'live', 'carefree', 'enjoy', 'way', 'life', 'accepting', 'everyone', 'everything', 'around', 'Even', 'when', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'accepting', 'them.The', 'collection', 'great', 'who', 'fondly', 'remember', 'Gomez', 'Morticia', 'definitely', 'wonderful', 'next', 'generation', 'who', 'might', 'wonder', 'why', 'loved', 'shows', 'odd', 'family', 'living', 'old', 'house.Although', 'still', 'creepy', 'spooky', 'altogether', 'ooky', 'still', 'love', 'Addams', 'Family']",The Addams Family - The Complete Series

Creativity is pouring out of the corners here.  Names like Morticia, Pugsley, Wednesday, Lurch, Uncle Fester and Cousin Itt pull the viewer in immediately.  The whole enterprise became more obviously dark with the release of the movies of the 1990's, which I also appreciate.

Some could complain that they are flip side discs, but just stick a cloth in the case if it bothers you.My parents watched this when it started, I enjoyed growing up watching it, and even my 8 year old niece loves it.How could you not love this timeless classic of a deranged and strange family that poke fun at normal living and flip reality around to make it a fun half hour show with true morals and fun zany comedy.The DVD's come complete with all 3 seasons, digitally remastered, subtitles in yellow (important to those who care) and a few bonus features here and there.The Addams Family still hold up well with todays audience both young and old and I can't see why anyone would ever have anything bad to say about one of the all time great comedy series.The bonus features on the first season show a heap of interviews, and behind the scenes stuff, interesting to watch for any fan. The other discs mostly contain an audio commentary here and there, and some silly Audio Commentaries to a scene by Cousin Itt and Thing.I bought the region 1 version cause it is half the price of the Australian release. And I am not at all disappointed with the purchase of this great timeless classic.The only reason I wont give a perfect 5 stars is because it was the perfect opportunity to include the 1977 Halloween (reunion) show they did, and was the only Adams Family of the series in color. Had that have been included, I would have been very happy with the bonus content.",4,dunnuh nuh nut *click* * click*,1196035200,"11 26, 2007",2007,1568,"['whole', 'family', 'been', 'enjoying', 'original', 'Adams', 'Family', 'series.All', '3', 'seasons', 'one', 'box', 'set', 'could', 'complain', 'are', 'flip', 'side', 'discs', 'just', 'stick', 'cloth', 'case', 'you.My', 'parents', 'watched', 'when', 'started', 'enjoyed', 'growing', 'up', 'watching', 'even', '8', 'year', 'old', 'niece', 'it.How', 'could', 'not', 'love', 'timeless', 'classic', 'deranged', 'strange', 'family', 'poke', 'fun', 'normal', 'living', 'flip', 'reality', 'make', 'fun', 'half', 'hour', 'show', 'true', 'morals', 'fun', 'zany', 'comedy.The', 'DVD', 'come', 'complete', '3', 'seasons', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'subtitles', 'yellow', 'important', 'who', 'care', 'few', 'bonus', 'features', 'here', 'there.The', 'Addams', 'Family', 'still', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'todays', 'audience', 'young', 'old', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'ever', 'have', 'anything', 'bad', 'say', 'one', 'time', 'great', 'comedy', 'series.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'heap', 'interviews', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'interesting', 'watch', 'fan', 'other', 'discs', 'mostly', 'contain', 'audio', 'commentary', 'here', 'there', 'silly', 'Audio', 'Commentaries', 'scene', 'Cousin', 'Itt', 'Thing.I', 'bought', 'region', '1', 'version', 'cause', 'price', 'Australian', 'release', 'am', 'not', 'disappointed', 'purchase', 'great', 'timeless', 'classic.The', 'only', 'reason', 'wont', 'give', 'perfect', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'include', '1977', 'Halloween', 'reunion', 'show', 'did', 'was', 'only', 'Adams', 'Family', 'series', 'color', 'Had', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'happy', 'bonus', 'content']",The Addams Family - The Complete Series

We put in the first disc and watched the fist episode.  From that point forward is was basically two months of a chant in chorus: ""Addams Family! Addams Family!""  They watched it straight through and then went through it again and again, perhaps a total of five times. They still won't let me pack it away, they want it readily available.I didn't complain too much, because to my delight I found that this show, like so many from the era, is simple astonishingly good television.  I had enjoyed it as a kid, but I didn't remember it as well as the Munsters (which is also, obviously, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED).  The creativity of this production is just fabulous, and the acting superb.  Lurch is fascinating, with his dead-pan visage, spontaneous appearances and harpsichord playing (backed by the genius Vic Mizzy). The same actor plays ""Thing""--and he says so much with his animated hand movements.  You can't overstate the fundamental brilliance of Thing.  Morticia is as glamourous as the living-dead (or whatever she is) can be.  She is gorgeous, and quite the botanist with her collection of highly cognizant plants. The Addams' life of leisure is quite enviable, as they always use their infinite time at home to fine-tune their various blue-blooded skills, and they prove themselves to be true Renassaince folk. Jackie Coogan's Uncle Fester is out of control. Illuminating light bulbs in his mouth, getting stretched on the rack, he's always up for a good time, and apparently oblivious to pain.  Aleister Crowley, I suspect, would consider this zany character his most cherished legacy. And ""Cousin It""?  Wow, that character almost scares me.  He, or It, I should say, is truly a psychedelic and sophisticated flourish which takes the show into a different realm of bizarre surreality.The real show-stealer is Gomez, played by John Astin.  Good grief, the character he created here is just insanely funny.  He is dynamic, eccentric, suave, outrageous, gallant, compassionate, dapper, forgiving, generous...I could go on with descriptors for an hour.  I've told my wife I really need to become a lot more like Gomez.  He is truly one of the all-time great television characters. I read somewhere that Groucho Marx was used as a reference point for the character, and it makes sense.  John, if you by chance read this, my deepest thanks for all the happiness you have brought to the world.  It must be immensely satisfying knowing that you have brought so many smiles to this planet.The scripts are extremely clever, with both an adult level and a kid's level.  I'm surprised how many of the issues the family deals with are relevant to today's world: turbulance in the stock market; issues with school officials (who disapprove of the kids bringing weapons and dynamite to campus, etc.), taxes, dysfunction in government, etc.In the extras, there is an effort to remind everyone that this show was derived from the comic strip.  That is generous, but I personally think this this show transcends and betters the comic strip in a multitude of ways.  The debt of gratitiude should run to the show, not the other way around.What has happened to our world?  Yeah, global warming, over-population, the economy...but also look at television as a micro-paradigm of societal decay.  I know you will say there have been good shows recently, and there have been (some).  But if you do a side-by-side comparison of, say, some good shows like  The Sopranos, Frazier, Seinfield, and Friends and you compare them with The Wild, Wild West, The Munsters, Addams Family, Batman, Mission Impossible, The Night Gallery, Benny Hill, Leave it to Beaver...one gets the strong impression that creativity is really in decline.  The sheer level of elaboration in the production values alone distinguishes the eras: the sets themselves were works of art.  Television used to go full-out, now it is so frequently about compromise and cost-cutting.  Are ""reality shows"" going to implant the wonderful visions into the minds of kids that these shows did?  Instead, I get a migraine from ""Survivor"" and the like--and even ""American Idol"" has a chaotic, campy aspect which certainly doesn't enrich the world much.But I digress.  The Addams Family is one of life's really good things. For the ten times the price, you would be well rewarded by what you get here. The pictures look great, and the fun is non-stop.

1098473,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000V3JGIS,trebe,"[4, 4]","The darkly humorous cartoons of Charles Addams, were used as the basis for the television series The Addams Family (1964-66) which ran on ABC for two seasons.  Working with the cartoonist, the series creators named the previously unnamed characters, put them together as a family, and came up with the concept of featuring a family with a dark and weird lifestyle.  The after the idealistic portrayals of families in the 50's, a number of wacky variations of domestic life came to prime time.  The Addams Family, The Munsters, Bewitched, and The Beverly Hillbillies, to name a few, were part of this trend.The Addams Family featured John Astin as wealthy Gomez Addams, a lawyer and dabbler in the stock market.  Carolyn Jones is his cultured wife Morticia, whose hobbies include raising carnivorous plants.  Former child star Jackie Coogan is Uncle Fester, a strange fellow who can power a light bulb by sticking it in his mouth.  Blossom Rock (Marie Blake) is Grandmama, a harmless witch.  Ted Cassidy is Lurch, the butler, who entertains the family by playing the harpsichord.  The Addams' children are played by Ken Weatherwax as the adventurous Pugsley, and Lisa Loring as the gloomy Wednesday.  Thing, the disembodied hand in a box, is a most unique character, adapted from a Charles Addams' creation.  Hairy cousin Itt (Felix Silla/Anthony Magro) was a reoccurring character, not created by Addams.  Most of the action, takes place inside or around the Addams' mansion.  With its assortment of strange objects, torture devices, animals, and exotic displays, the residence is almost like another character.Most of the humor is related to the family's eccentric behavior, and strange habits, such as Gomez and Morticia fencing in the living room, Gomez practicing yoga or deliberately crashing electric trains, and the family going out at night to get a moontan.  Some humor involves references to strange things that are never seen, such as dining on yak, Wednesday's pet spiders, Grandmama's alligator wrestling, or Pugsley's fondness for playing with dynamite.The program also has some provocative elements.  One is Gomez's amorous behavior towards Morticia, usually initiated whenever she speaks French.  Kissing the arm is funny, but when overdone, gets weird and creepy.  The program also features torture devices, like the rack, vise, pillory, and bed of nails, as ""therapeutic"" devices to relieve aches and pains.  Despite the goofy elements, with its mature sensibilities, The Addams Family probably plays better to an adult audience.  Producer Nat Perrin wrote for the Marx Brothers, and there is clearly a lot of Groucho Marx in Gomez's personality and mannerisms.Mostly confined to the mansion, and with central characters that don't have jobs, apparently made coming up with fresh ideas a challenge at times.  The Addams' residence becomes the frequent destination of various relatives, and an assortment of visitors.  Although they tried to mix things up, after a while, some of the repetitious gags (trick gate/doorbell, walkthrough by Kitty the lion, the stuffed bear and mounted moose and fish head) no longer have much effect.  To their credit, some of the older gags are replaced with new ones, as the funroom is replaced by things like Gomez using a trampoline, and Morticia plucking on a samisen.Both cool, and vulnerable, Lurch is a terrific character.  Stories featuring him are almost always winners.  Ted Cassidy doesn't say much, but his talent definitely shines through from under the makeup.  Too bad he wasn't featured more than he was.  Fester and Gomez are generally the most animated and quick to act.  Jackie Coogan brings energy to his performance, but Fester also isn't in the spotlight much, and some of the stories featuring him are weak.  Still, the character shows a lot of growth, from a just guy who sticks a light bulb in his mouth.  Gomez is impulsive and involved in many activities that keep the series interesting.  His impetuousness is countered by the more rational Morticia, the anchor who generally keeps things under control.  Morticia has wacky moments, but they are seldom extreme.  Carolyn Jones also appears as Morticia's unbalanced sister Ophelia, a character that allows Jones to shed the tight black dress, and display more eccentric sides of her personality.Appearances by the remaining cast was a little spotty, as Blossom Rock appeared in less than half the episodes.  Minors Ken Weatherwax and Lisa Loring had limited availability, and Pugsley and Wednesday, really aren't around as much as you might think.  Lisa Loring grew up a lot between the two seasons.  Helping to fill in the gaps, Cousin Itt was introduced in Episode 20, and appeared in 24 episodes.  For whatever reasons, the supporting cast wasn't featured as well as they might have been.The Munsters were on the air at exactly the same time period (1964-66), but unlike the Addams the Munsters were not rich.  They frequently left their Mockingbird Lane home, and faced many zany situations and interacted with all kinds of people.  Herman Munster's many activities included bronco riding, pro wrestling, playing for the LA Dodgers, drag racing, and even becoming a pop singer.  Lily, Grampa, Eddie, and Herman, all wore greenish makeup.  Grampa could turn into a bat or a wolf, and concocted magic potions.  Eddie went to school, and Marilyn dated.  While the Addams' were affluent homebodies with macabre tastes, the Munsters were working class with an active lifestyle similar to the average American family.  The approaches taken by the two programs were very different, but with more of an appeal to kids, it's not surprising that The Munsters was more popular.  While the Addams were home, the Munsters were taking on the world.  Strangely although popular, both programs were cancelled after just two seasons.MGM Studios (now in bankruptcy) decided to break the two seasons (64 episodes), into three ""volumes"".  The complete series set is a compilation of the three volumes, on double sided discs.  The episodes are subtitled (handy when foreign languages are spoken).  Cast members Ken Weatherwax, Lisa Loring, and Felix Silla, along with author Stephen Cox, contribute commentary tracks for several episodes, but it would have been nice to hear more from John Austin.  Also included is a featurette recognizing the valuable contributions of composer Vic Mizzy.The Addams Family is a unique comedy with a dark quirky sense of humor.  While successfully making the transformation from a cartoon to a 60's classic, the series doesn't quite reach the potential it could have, though it's still a wacky and fun blast from the past.",4,Charles Addams' cartoons come to life on television...an extended retrospective,1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,6665,"['darkly', 'humorous', 'cartoons', 'Charles', 'Addams', 'were', 'used',
