1220344,A1ZYA1450LWBXF,B001NMT8FW,Amazon Customer,"[22, 22]","Belly dancing is essentially an improvised dance. Certainly you have choreographies, and wonderful ones at that, but what is most remarkable about the dance is that the dancer can come up with skillful moves entirely spontaneously. And she matches the music perfectly while doing so! That's why anyone who's interested enough in this dance wants to be able to interpret the music and really really dance to it with self-expression, emotion and enjoyment. But how on earth do you teach creativity? It's a tough one; which is why most belly dance videos focus wholly on muscle work and combinations and choreographies - but they're at a loss how to figure out teaching improvisation. Some teachers say it can't be taught whatsoever and tell the learner to ""just do it"" or ""listen to the music!""Until now. Nadira Jamal's video, the first on this subject, actually does tackle the challenging area of improvisation. In this first of a three-DVD series, Nadira focuses on Movement Recall, which is what gives most people ""dancer's block"".This video begins with an orientation to improvisation and what the video series will bring. I like that a warm up has been included here because you don't have to stop and turn to another activity. The warm up is adequate for the activity on the video.After you physically warm up, it's time to get the creative side of you going with a session of ""noodling"" or playing with movement. Noodling is a nice fun concept meant to loosen you up and disinhibit you. The exercises Nadira puts you through while noodling make you turn off your inner critic and have fun with movements. Nadira explains the concept in detail, gives its rationale and logic, and demos how she would do it. Then you have a whirl yourself. This isn't just an ice breaker but also leads on to the next set of explanations and exercises.Through a series of exploratory exercises and demos, Nadira next gets you acquainted with your own movement vocabulary and helps you identify your key moves. With each exercise on this video, you find yourself exploring your moves in different ways. The exercises stop you from over-thinking and getting stuck in complex territory. What's really nice is that relatively early beginners can use the few belly dance movements they've learnt and use these exercises to start being creative. The exercises are an excellent way of getting concepts into your head because you're doing something rather than just listening to explanations of what improvisation means, conceptually.More exercises help you take into account timing, transitions, weight changes into your improvisation.The next chunk of exercises is most innovative. It involves arranging your moves into lots of categories. I'm not getting into more detail on this as it would take the fun out of the video. Or sort of spoil the surprise, anyway. Broadly I'd say that instead of creating with individual movements you're now using categories. Now you've moved from fooling around with the alphabets into guided chunks of improvisation! You may, like me, find yourself smiling at this point because the penny has dropped. This is probably the point where you'll be yelling - hey! I'm doin it! And did I forget to say.. it's fun!But the funnest of all exercises is the final one: choreographing the song, Layla. Something I've always wanted to do, by the way. What Nadira does here is to give you different levels of help choreographing this song. She starts backwards - and that's a great tip I'm going to use often - and shows you how to end the song. But moving further back along the song, she leaves chunks out for you to fill in. You work your way right to the beginning of the song. With several repetitions - there you have it! It's really too delightful.Through these exercises, all of which use music from the CD Bellydance for Fortune and Fame by the Mogador Band, pretty scenes fill the screen at points where you have to do stuff on your own with voice cues. The whole video has a wonderful flow and is sort of butter smooth from one end to the other.As it weren't a wonderful enough video already, Nadira leaves you with some thoughts on what else to do - and even more exercises on her Taktaba website. Taktaba, by the way, is thename of Nadira's podcasts. How she's managed to make such easy work of such a difficult subject, I totally don't know.Why do I talk so much! In one word - fantastic.",5,Get over improvisation phobia with this first-ever video instruction on the subject,1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,4405,"['Belly', 'dancing', 'essentially', 'improvised', 'dance', 'Certainly', 'have', 'choreographies', 'wonderful', 'ones', 'what', 'most', 'remarkable', 'dance', 'dancer', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'skillful', 'moves', 'entirely', 'spontaneously', 'music', 'perfectly', 'doing', 'so', 'why', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'enough', 'dance', 'be', 'able', 'interpret', 'music', 'really', 'really', 'dance', 'self-expression', 'emotion', 'enjoyment', 'how', 'earth', 'do', 'teach', 'creativity', 'tough', 'one', 'why', 'most', 'belly', 'dance', 'videos', 'focus', 'wholly', 'muscle', 'work', 'combinations', 'choreographies', ""'re"", 'loss', 'how', 'figure', 'out', 'teaching', 'improvisation', 'teachers', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'taught', 'whatsoever', 'tell', 'learner', 'just', 'do', 'listen', 'music', 'now', 'Nadira', 'Jamal', 'video', 'first', 'subject', 'actually', 'tackle', 'challenging', 'area', 'improvisation', 'first', 'three-DVD', 'series', 'Nadira', 'Movement', 'Recall', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'dancer', 'block', '.This', 'video', 'orientation', 'improvisation', 'what', 'video', 'series', 'will', 'bring', 'like', 'warm', 'up', 'been', 'included', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'stop', 'turn', 'activity', 'warm', 'up', 'adequate', 'activity', 'video.After', 'physically', 'warm', 'up', 'time', 'get', 'creative', 'side', 'going', 'session', 'noodling', 'playing', 'movement', 'Noodling', 'nice', 'fun', 'concept', 'meant', 'loosen', 'up', 'disinhibit', 'exercises', 'Nadira', 'noodling', 'make', 'turn', 'off', 'inner', 'critic', 'have', 'fun', 'movements', 'Nadira', 'concept', 'detail', 'rationale', 'logic', 'demos', 'how', 'would', 'do', 'Then', 'have', 'whirl', ""n't"", 'just', 'ice', 'breaker', 'also', 'next', 'set', 'explanations', 'exercises.Through', 'series', 'exploratory', 'exercises', 'demos', 'Nadira', 'next', 'acquainted', 'own', 'movement', 'vocabulary', 'identify', 'key', 'moves', 'exercise', 'video', 'find', 'exploring', 'moves', 'different', 'ways', 'exercises', 'stop', 'over-thinking', 'getting', 'stuck', 'complex', 'territory', 'What', 'really', 'nice', 'relatively', 'early', 'beginners', 'can', 'use', 'few', 'belly', 'dance', 'movements', ""'ve"", 'learnt', 'use', 'exercises', 'start', 'being', 'creative', 'exercises', 'are', 'excellent', 'way', 'getting', 'concepts', 'head', ""'re"", 'doing', 'something', 'rather', 'just', 'listening', 'explanations', 'what', 'improvisation', 'conceptually.More', 'exercises', 'help', 'take', 'account', 'timing', 'transitions', 'weight', 'changes', 'improvisation.The', 'next', 'chunk', 'exercises', 'most', 'innovative', 'arranging', 'moves', 'lots', 'categories', ""'m"", 'not', 'getting', 'more', 'detail', 'would', 'take', 'fun', 'video', 'sort', 'spoil', 'surprise', 'anyway', 'Broadly', ""'d"", 'say', 'instead', 'creating', 'individual', 'movements', ""'re"", 'now', 'using', 'categories', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'moved', 'fooling', 'around', 'alphabets', 'guided', 'chunks', 'improvisation', 'may', 'find', 'smiling', 'point', 'penny', 'dropped', 'probably', 'point', 'where', ""'ll"", 'be', 'yelling', 'hey', ""'m"", 'doin', 'did', 'forget', 'say..', 'fun', 'funnest', 'exercises', 'final', 'one', 'choreographing', 'song', 'Layla', 'Something', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'do', 'way', 'What', 'Nadira', 'here', 'give', 'different', 'levels', 'help', 'choreographing', 'song', 'backwards', 'great', 'tip', ""'m"", 'going', 'use', 'often', 'how', 'end', 'song', 'moving', 'further', 'back', 'song', 'chunks', 'out', 'fill', 'work', 'way', 'right', 'beginning', 'song', 'several', 'repetitions', 'there', 'have', 'really', 'too', 'delightful.Through', 'exercises', 'use', 'music', 'CD', 'Bellydance', 'Fortune', 'Fame', 'Mogador', 'Band', 'pretty', 'scenes', 'fill', 'screen', 'points', 'where', 'have', 'do', 'stuff', 'own', 'voice', 'cues', 'whole', 'video', 'wonderful', 'flow', 'sort', 'butter', 'smooth', 'one', 'end', 'other.As', 'were', ""n't"", 'wonderful', 'enough', 'video', 'already', 'Nadira', 'thoughts', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'even', 'more', 'exercises', 'Taktaba', 'website', 'Taktaba', 'way', 'thename', 'Nadira', 'podcasts', 'How', 'managed', 'make', 'such', 'easy', 'work', 'such', 'difficult', 'subject', 'totally', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.Why', 'do', 'talk', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'word', 'fantastic']",Improvisation Toolkit Volume 1: Movement Recall

1220346,ANV5AOL3V80S7,B001NMT8FW,jodie,"[1, 1]","I was trying to learn everything at once and had a sea of belly dance mess going on in my head. This dance video helped me narrow it down during practice so that I could acheive beautiful technique, control, relaxation, and muscle memory. In short, I have a better way to practice with amazing results at the end of each session. The three concepts taught in this video that created order and calm in my world are compartmentalizing movements in an associative way so that they are right where I need them, when I need them. Muscle Memory, which changed my practices from being all over the place into two movements, not ten thousand. And finally, transitions. Amazing. It seems obvious. I have always thought of transitions on a bigger scale. Usually when I got stuck choreographing something. But like a picture on a wall in my home, I passed by this concept every day without ever really seeing it. I now have belly dance moves in compartments and I practice transitions between them. So, if you're overwhelemd by the amount of dance movements you are learning and already know, freeze or go into hyperdrive during improv, have those uncomfortable moments of being off balance or getting stuck, Nadira will remove the self made mountains and take you through simple practices that will make all the difference in the world. I would recommend this product to everyone. Students and Teachers. I recommend this product to teachers because, though a teacher or professional may already know and understand these concepts themselves, some students think only in pictures. Movies play in our head with every word a person speaks. Nadira creates a movie for people like us. Once we picture the words and their movements going into a physical compartment, we understand. The world makes sense to us. My figure skating coach use to draw on the ice with markers for me, then she would speak as Nadira does in an associative manner with objects and hand gestures to show shape or angle. I only realized we all had a different way of learning and processing information when I became a college student. As a society, we don't think about it, but everyone has a different way of learning, and this approach makes the difference between total confusion and complete understanding.

1220347,AS11CSPXHH997,B001NMT8FW,Lionel's Grammy,"[10, 10]","I took a chance on this DVD based on Mala Bhargava's review. I have never regretted a single purchase made following her recommendations. This DVD is extraordinary.  I had been losing focus just doing drills and following choreography from the more than 30 belly dance DVD's I own.  Within a minute or two Nadira had me captivated and hopeful that the answer to my lack of direction might be forthcoming. I just followed her instructions, (rather than give the DVD a run-through first) and by the time the DVD was over I knew this DVD was the missing link for me. I went straight to her web-page to find even more wonderful information, and some surprise treats.  I actually made a list placing all of the moves I know in an order in which to make them ""safety moves"".  Today at work, I ""noodled"" in the bathroom stall during my breaks. lol. Thanks to this DVD, I am more inspired to really dig deep into myself to explore this beautiful art form. This production is perfect for anyone who knows the moves, but does not really know how to make them dance.  Well, gotta go now, I don't want to spend any more time online because I would rather be ""noodling"". (You will know what I mean if you buy the DVD). Please do not be put off by the reviewer who said she could not understand what Nadira was saying. She is articulate and easily understood. Her voice sinks into your consciousness and leads you deeper into the exercises with ease.
