622678,A1GN6YDINU5FKZ,B00005JMVQ,"British Boy Toy ""thirty craze""","[13, 15]","We should get one thing out of the way first: Nicholas Roeg's films are not everybody.  Moving on, this is possibly Roeg's best work and essential viewing for any movie lover or fan of great acting.  Released in 1980, this movie was not at all well recieved.  Rank, the film's distributor stalled on the film's release, there was the controversey over an X rating and critics and viewers, at the time, obviously didn't know what to make of it.  Twenty five years later with so many changes in what is accepted in movies today, it might be seen as lighter fare....well, maybe.Nicholas Roeg could easily be passed off as a ""shock director"", but he is a unique talent who makes movies that have so many layers of meaning that it takes more than one viewing, maybe even two to understand what his movies are really about.  The setting is cold war Vienna.  Alex, a famous psychiatrist meets Meleana, an artistic,talented beauty without an occupation.  Their attraction is immediate, their story unfolds through a series of flashbacks.  Roeg makes it clear from the very beginning that the story does not have a happy ending.  It is up to the audience to stay and find out why.Alex appears to be quite normal from the beginning.  He has the high paying job, the renowned reputaion, a glamouras life of high society friends.  Everything about Alex symbolizes control and normalcy.  Later in the film, though, we find that this isn't so.  Alex is may appear like this on the surface, but he is truly an insecure man.Which might be why he is so intrigued of Meleana from the very beginning.  Meleana represents everything that Alex is not and can never be.  Leaning in a hallway at a party, she stops him dead in his tracks by blocking him with her leg.  Her presence is show stopping in the film and it's meant to be.  Meleana is street smart, daring, wise, experienced and most importantly INDEPENDANT.  She doesn't rely on anyone or have any kind of expectaions from anyone.  She is a legitimate free spirit.  Alex may not know it then, but he's drawn to her for more than her beauty.  She fills in all the things he can't or ever hope to.Meleana is not perfect.  As most free spirits are she is somewhat hypocritical, irresponsible and surperficial.  But she doesn't try to hide things.  She does love Alex, but she refuses to let it destroy who she is and what she is about.  Alex, on the other hand, control freak that he is, is determined to change her.  He wants to make Meleana normal, when he can't do that, his sickness starts and it becomes out of control, ending in disaster.This is not just a movie about ""sexual obsession"", as has been touted, but about ""obsession"".  Period.  Roeg is making a very strong case about turning people into objects and not treating them or ""loving"" them as how they truly are.  As Meleana tries to convey to Alex to an embarrassing and painful end, why can't he love her and trust her for who she is?  This begs to question, is Meleana really irresponsible or is she just being who she is, without any promises to anyone?  Is Alex so insecure with himself that he can't accept a person's, god forbid a WOMAN, to be independant?Most of the answers lie in the movie's ending, which is devastating and upsetting.  I venture to guess it's the kind of ending that Alfred Hitchcock would have attempted, if he wasn't worried about the outcome and how it would effect him later in his career.  Though it is not intentional, the film does seems to unravel in a Hitchcock fashion.  And this is something that was definatey overlooked when it was released, overshadowed by all of the controversey.  It is a testatment to Roeg's talent and ability as a filmmaker.  The story unfolds as vital drama but also as a suspenseful thriller.Many eyebrowes were raised i'm sure to the casting of Art Garfunkel.  But this makes perfect sense within the first ten minutes of the film.  Garfunkel, hands down already looks the part:  the receding hairline of goofy hair, the lanky body frame and the effeminate physicality and tone of voice.  Garfunkel also has a boyish innocence that comes across throughout the film.  He is totally in tune with who the character is.  It's a performance that was probably overlooked and underrated.  A very smart choice by the director to choose someone other than an actor expected to fill the part.Alex signifies someone who isn't strong or secure.  But Meleana is attracted to him for these very reasons.  At a restaurant, when Alex becomes upset with Meleana flirting with another man, she tells him, ""you're sexier"", as she throws herself at him.  Meleana is happy with who he is, it's Alex who can't accept himself and lets his insecurity go awry.Theresa Russell is groundbreaking in the role of Meleana.  It is hard to imagine that Russell was only 22 when she played the role.  And it's impossible to think of another actress from that time playing a role like this.  Russell proved herself early in her career playing alongside great 70's icons like Dustin Hoffman and Robert DeNiro.  But Russell was obviously not going to play along by Hollywood's standards of what a beautiful actress should aspire to.  Russell is an intelligent actress and an independant thinker.  These characteristics are brought to the very center of Meleana.  Russell inhabits the character, she's not ""playing"" a character.  It is astonishing to watch her for the time she is onscreen.  At one moment she is fine, in another she is hurt at the very center of her being, in another she experiences a bizarre bipolar episode, putting on clown makeup and throwing bottles onto an empty street at night.  It's hard to remember when an actress took these kind of roles, let alone these kind of chances on the screen.  Unfortunately, Russel's talent was overlooked that year because of the movie's subject matter and controversey.  It's the kind of performance that should be studied by actors and directors alike.The same can be said for Nicholas Roeg.  He is a true original.  Sadly, it seems that slew of other directors, David Lynch comes to mind, would be inspired and later lionized for the road that he paved for them.  Roeg has continued to make films as controversal and important like Bad Timing.  But it is obvious that this is the movie that he should be known for and continue to be seen.",5,Theresa Russell is a tour de force in Roeg's classic film,1170633600,"02 5, 2007",2007,6330,"['should',

622679,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B00005JMVQ,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[2, 2]","Nicholas Roeg used his real life wife, Theresa Russell, as the female love interest in this, his best film. Art Garfunkel plays the male lead, a professor, in that phase of his life when he was acting instead of singing. This film has been compared to LAST TANGO IN PARIS.  Its theme of sexual obsession between an unlikely man and woman is similar.  However, the obsession in LAST TANGO is kicked off by Brando's wife's suicide.  There is no cause in BAD TIMING which similarly explains the man's obsession.  These two come together with wild, animalistic lust and it never seems like there is any more than that.  However, it is apparent that these two are terrible for one another. The film is shot in a jerky fashion (deliberately) with flashes back and forward in time. It produces a very clashing effect.  If the couple were a musical composition, you would judge it/them as atonal and dissonant.  There is not one element of harmony to this couple other than when they animalistically mate.  What does a musician dread as his worst nightmare?  He fears losing his timing.  The timing is bad throughout and thus the affair is always poised on the edge of oblivion, the disharmony threatening to shatter it. Harvey Keitel also plays a police officer in this movie.

622682,A14GFBX4V1Y79W,B00005JMVQ,Donald Gavron,"[4, 5]","""Bad Timing"" is nothing short of brilliant. This overlooked masterpiece from director Nicolas Roeg (""The Man Who Fell to Earth,"" ""Don't Look Now"") is a fascinating study of control and megalomania. Released in 1980, the UK distributor called the movie ""a sick film made by sick people for sick people.""Fans of Roeg's obtuse directing style will be enthralled as he weaves a tangled web of seduction, betrayal, secrecy and sadistic control reminiscent of Bertolucci's ""Last Tango in Paris."" No Marlon Brando, Art Garfunkel is adequate and a bit bland as one half of the doomed couple, as he eventually initiates the events leading to the near tragic ending. The film is told out of sequence, which only adds to the sadness at the core of the story.A young Theresa Russell gives a bravura performance as the troubled Milena, who at first seduces psychologist Alex Linden (played by Garfunkle), then falls victim to his constant surveillance and questioning. Anyone who has been on either side of a relationship like this can identify with the characters and their torment.Told in flashback as Milena is fighting for her life in a hospital operating room, Linden is being questioned by a determined police investigator (wonderfully played by Harvey Keitel), who suspects that Linden may have waited a little too long to call an ambulance for his distressed lover. The ending of the film has the tragic weight of a punch in the gut.Denholm Elliott is also exceptional as Milena's estranged husband, who seems content to offer his wife a safe haven after her indulgences with other men. ""I can't wait for her to get bored with you,"" he tells Linden in a tense phone conversation.""Bad Timing"" matches the classic ""Last Tango in Paris"" in erotic content, and Theresa Russell gives a risky, no-holds-barred performance that will stay with the viewer long after the film is over. She gets under the skin of her character and lays bare all her vulnerabilities, as her love/hate relationship with a man she cannot get away from plumbs the depths of despair.Not for all tastes, ""Bad Timing"" is a grim tour-de-force by a gifted director guiding a powerful actress through a volatile landscape that is somewhere close to emotional hell.",5,"""Bad Timing"" is an Overlooked Masterpiece",1288915200,"11 5, 2010",2010,2222,"['Bad', 'Timing', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'overlooked', 'masterpiece', 'director', 'Nicolas', 'Roeg', 'Man', 'Who', 'Fell', 'Earth', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Now', 'fascinating', 'study', 'control', 'megalomania', 'Released', '1980', 'UK', 'distributor', 'called', 'movie', 'sick', 'film', 'made', 'sick', 'people', 'sick', 'people', 'Fans', 'Roeg', 'obtuse', 'directing', 'style', 'will', 'be', 'enthralled', 'tangled', 'web', 'seduction', 'betrayal', 'secrecy', 'sadistic', 'control', 'reminiscent', 'Bertolucci', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'adequate', 'bit', 'bland', 'one', 'half', 'doomed', 'couple', 'eventually', 'events', 'leading', 'near', 'tragic', 'ending', 'film', 'told', 'sequence', 'only', 'sadness', 'core', 'story.A', 'young', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'bravura', 'performance', 'troubled', 'Milena', 'who', 'first', 'seduces', 'psychologist', 'Alex', 'Linden', 'played', 'Garfunkle', 'then', 'victim', 'constant', 'surveillance', 'questioning', 'Anyone', 'who', 'been', 'side', 'relationship', 'can', 'identify', 'characters', 'torment.Told', 'flashback', 'Milena', 'fighting', 'life', 'hospital', 'operating', 'room', 'Linden', 'being', 'questioned', 'determined', 'police', 'investigator', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'who', 'Linden', 'may', 'have', 'waited', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'call', 'ambulance', 'distressed', 'lover', 'ending', 'film', 'tragic', 'weight', 'punch', 'gut.Denholm', 'Elliott', 'also', 'exceptional', 'Milena', 'estranged', 'husband', 'who', 'content', 'offer', 'wife', 'safe', 'haven', 'indulgences', 'other', 'men', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'bored', 'Linden', 'tense', 'phone', 'conversation', 'Bad', 'Timing', 'classic', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'erotic', 'content', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'risky', 'no-holds-barred', 'performance', 'will', 'stay', 'viewer', 'long', 'film', 'skin', 'character', 'lays', 'bare', 'vulnerabilities', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'man', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'away', 'plumbs', 'depths', 'despair.Not', 'tastes', 'Bad', 'Timing', 'grim', 'tour-de-force', 'gifted', 'director', 'guiding', 'powerful', 'actress', 'volatile', 'landscape', 'somewhere', 'close', 'emotional', 'hell']",Bad Timing

Although he still directs today, his career started, hit its peak, and ended between his first film ""Performance"" and this film. Many people refer to this as Roeg's last great film and it is a great film. Better than ""Performance"" and ""The Man Who Fell to Earth,"" but lacking the brilliance of ""Walkabout"" and ""Don't Look Now."" I've owned this film for nearly a year and have just now watched it and I can't believe I waited this long; This is really a terrific film. Roeg was always a director that played with chronology, but this film's chronology is certainly the most askewed of his other films. The film tells three stories at once, essentially. The first being why Milena Flaherty (Theresa Russell) is in the hospital. The second being the events leading up to her getting there. And the third being the relationship between Milena and Dr. Alex Linden (Art Garfunkel, in a terrific, underrated performance). Harvey Keitel also stars as Inspector Netusil, who's trying to find out exactly what happened the night that Milena wound up in the hospital. The film paints a visually haunting portrait of sexual obsession with powerhouse performances by Garfunkel and Russell. I've heard some reviewers call this film pretentious and it has its moments of pretentious-ness, but it's pretty realistic in my opinion...At least as a portrait of how sexual obsession can drive a person mad.

My thought at the time was that whereas I did not understand why Garfunkel would rather be making movies than record albums with Paul Simon, that the photograph could provide an explanation of sorts.  I did not flash on the that photograph until the appropriate scene in this 1980 film from director Nicolas Roeg popped up.  I checked out the film because it is a Criterion Collection edition and basically I am game for anything they want to put out.""Bad Timing"" begins in a museum in Vienna, Austria where the paintings of Gustav Klimt are contrasted with the Tom Waits song ""Invitation to the Blues,"" while Dr. Alex Linden (Garfunkel) and Milena Flaherty (Russell) check out the paintings and each other.  Then the wailing of a siren makes its presence known and an ambulance is racing down the street while inside Milena is fighting for her life and apologizing to somebody named Stefan, while Alex sits there making sure the paramedic does not look at more than he should.  From those two defining points of this relationship we begin jumping around in terms of both time and place.  Milena took an overdose of pills and called Alex, who called the police.  But Inspector Netusil (Harvey Keitel), who is assigned to the case, does not like what he hears from Alex in the way of answers to his questions.  Netusil's investigation proceeds in a chronological, but the story of Alex and Milena's relationship jumps all over the place until we finally get to the scene that makes everything clear, although only we are privileged to the ultimate truth.There is an infamous comment about ""Bad Timing,"" made at the time it came out by an studio executive in England, that this was ""a sick film made by sick people for sick people"" (it is quoted on one of the bonus features.  Stefan Vognic (Denholm Elliott) is Milena's husband, but she ends up having in intense sexually-charged relationship with Alex, a reserach psychiatrist from New York City who is teaching in Vienna.  He is something of a cold fish and she tends to drink too much and could be something of a manic depressive given the highs and lows she goes through, but it could just be a question of how sober she is at any given time.  A key scene regarding their relationship takes place on some stairs, where she starts ripping off her underwear and taunting Alex to take her then and there, which he does.  I would not say that these two are sick, but what might be an erotic act from the perspective of the viewing does not seem to bring either one of them much pleasure beyond the sexual.There is a curious disconnect between these two characters and I was wondering if this was more because it was the intent of the director or because Garfunkle's acting talent is limited, but then I remembered that I was not able to connect with either of Roeg's most noted earlier films, ""Don't Look Now"" and ""The Man Who Fell to Earth.""  This guy and I are simply on different wavelenghts, besides, while I understand what he sees in her, but her interest in him has to be taken at face value for the story to work.  Even if you agree that these are sick people, there is the question of exactly how they are sick and which one of them is sicker.  But do not worry, that last issue will be clearly settled for you in the end.  As it was, the question of why Milena would try to kill herself over Alex kept running into the solid certainty that he was not worth the effort.  Only when we get to the truth of the matter did this film really command my attention, but what it revealed was hardly heartening or uplifting, and the film's final punch-line only wallows it its view of the world.  The fact that the director ended up marrying his female star also ends up being worrisome food for thought.",3,Nicolas Roeg's 1980 film on a deeply troubled relationship,1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,3939,"['only', 'memory', 'film', 'Bad', 'Timing', 'seeing', 'photograph', 'one', 'annual', 'looks', 'Sex', 'Cinema', 'Playboy', 'totally', 'nude', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'bed', 'thought', 'time', 'was', 'whereas', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'Garfunkel', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'making', 'movies', 'record', 'albums', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'photograph', 'could', 'provide', 'explanation', 'sorts', 'did', 'not', 'flash', 'photograph', 'appropriate', 'scene', '1980', 'film', 'director', 'Nicolas', 'Roeg', 'popped', 'up', 'checked', 'out', 'film', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'edition', 'basically', 'am', 'game', 'anything', 'want', 'put', 'out', 'Bad', 'Timing', 'museum', 'Vienna', 'Austria', 'where', 'paintings', 'Gustav', 'Klimt', 'are', 'contrasted', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'song', 'Invitation', 'Blues', 'Dr.', 'Alex', 'Linden', 'Garfunkel', 'Milena', 'Flaherty', 'Russell', 'check', 'out', 'paintings', 'other', 'Then', 'wailing', 'siren', 'presence', 'known', 'ambulance', 'racing', 'down', 'street', 'inside', 'Milena', 'fighting', 'life', 'apologizing', 'somebody', 'named', 'Stefan', 'Alex', 'making', 'sure', 'paramedic', 'not', 'look', 'more', 'should', 'two', 'defining', 'points', 'relationship', 'begin', 'jumping', 'around', 'terms', 'time', 'place', 'Milena', 'took', 'overdose', 'pills', 'called', 'Alex', 'who', 'called', 'police', 'Inspector', 'Netusil', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'who', 'assigned', 'case', 'not', 'like', 'what', 'Alex', 'way', 'answers', 'questions', 'Netusil', 'investigation', 'proceeds', 'chronological', 'story', 'Alex', 'Milena', 'relationship', 'place', 'finally', 'get', 'scene', 'everything', 'clear', 'only', 'are', 'privileged', 'ultimate', 'truth.There', 'infamous', 'comment', 'Bad', 'Timing', 'made', 'time', 'came', 'out', 'studio', 'executive', 'England', 'was', 'sick', 'film', 'made', 'sick', 'people', 'sick', 'people', 'quoted', 'one', 'bonus', 'features', 'Stefan', 'Vognic', 'Denholm', 'Elliott', 'Milena', 'husband', 'up', 'having', 'intense', 'sexually-charged', 'relationship', 'Alex', 'reserach', 'psychiatrist', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'who', 'teaching', 'Vienna', 'something', 'cold', 'fish', 'drink', 'too', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'something', 'manic', 'depressive', 'given', 'highs', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'question', 'how', 'sober', 'given', 'time', 'key', 'scene', 'regarding', 'relationship', 'place', 'stairs', 'where', 'ripping', 'off', 'underwear', 'taunting', 'Alex', 'take', 'then', 'there', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'two', 'are', 'sick', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'erotic', 'act', 'perspective', 'viewing', 'not', 'seem', 'bring', 'one', 'much', 'pleasure', 'sexual.There', 'curious', 'disconnect', 'two', 'characters', 'was', 'wondering', 'was', 'more', 'was', 'intent', 'director', 'Garfunkle', 'acting', 'talent', 'limited', 'then', 'remembered', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'connect', 'Roeg', 'most', 'noted', 'earlier', 'films', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Now', 'Man', 'Who', 'Fell', 'Earth', 'guy', 'are', 'simply', 'different', 'wavelenghts', 'besides', 'understand', 'what', 'interest', 'be', 'taken', 'face', 'value', 'story', 'work', 'Even', 'agree', 'are', 'sick', 'people', 'question', 'exactly', 'how', 'are', 'sick', 'one', 'sicker', 'do', 'not', 'worry', 'last', 'issue', 'will', 'be', 'clearly', 'settled', 'end', 'was', 'question', 'why', 'Milena', 'would', 'try', 'kill', 'Alex', 'kept', 'running', 'solid', 'certainty', 'was', 'not', 'worth', 'effort', 'Only', 'when', 'get', 'truth', 'matter', 'did', 'film', 'really', 'command', 'attention', 'what', 'revealed', 'was', 'hardly', 'heartening', 'uplifting', 'film', 'final', 'punch-line', 'only', 'view', 'world', 'fact', 'director', 'ended', 'up', 'marrying', 'female', 'star', 'also', 'up', 'being', 'worrisome', 'food', 'thought']",Bad Timing

622695,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00005JMVQ,Trevor Willsmer,"[39, 44]","Seen a quarter of a century on, 'Bad Timing' stands out as one of Nicolas Roeg's most satisfying and complex films and yet it can be one of his hardest to discuss. It's a film I feel a little guilty about writing so little about, but even on a second viewing it's still rather overwhelming. It's interesting how it manages to be so genuinely multi-layered, more like a novel than a film - the way it mixes voyeurism, spying and emotional, psychological and legal investigation (with Keitel's investigation of the suicide scene placing him firmly in scenes as an unseen voyeur through Terry Rawlings typically brilliant editing) is remarkable enough, but the film manages to do so much more besides. And the performances are incredibly brave - how many leading men can you think of who would effectively (and quite deliberately effeminately) play the woman's role during the lovers' initial meeting? Russell in particular shows an astonishing range in what should be an impossible part, making her inability to find decent roles these days even more disappointing.True it falls apart in the last couple of reels when the performances don't quite ring true, but it's still the last great film Nic Roeg made before settling into prolific mediocrity. It's as a brilliantly edited post-mortem into a mutually destructive relationship rather than a police mystery that it really enthralls, even when it doesn't entirely work. Much more impressive than I remembered, it's not a feelgood movie - if anything it's the date movie from hell - but it is a remarkably ambitious and accomplished one.So why is the film so little-known and perhaps even less-seen? Well, that seems to be down to some bad luck and bad timing of its own.In the US it hit censorship problems and in Europe it had major problems with its distribution. It was one of Rank's last full slate of British productions, so should have been guaranteed a circuit release on the Odeon chain in the UK. Unfortunately, the head of Rank Theatres was so disgusted by the film (the Rank Organisation was originally started to make religious films and many of the old guard were still in place in 1980) that he refused to book it into a single one of their theatres - the only Rank film to be so 'honored' (although he wasn't much enamoured of Eagle's Wing either). The second biggest circuit was owned by Rank's biggest rival, EMI, who weren't interested in helping out their balance sheet, so it ended up on Lew Grade's very small Classic chain. Rank's distribution in Europe was no more enthusiastic.(Of course, Roeg's next and most expensive film, Eureka, had even bigger problems, being pulled a couple of weeks after opening due to a libel lawsuit that kept it on the shelf for years. Since then, despite the not really successful brave try with Cold Heaven, he seems to be little more than a director for hire on a slew of disappointing pictures and cable movies.) As a result, it's been very hard to track down since its original release, but it's well worth the effort if you're looking for challenging fare.Criterion's DVD boasts a much better transfer than the UK DVD (which only features a trailer) and a more comprehensive extras package - interviews with Russell, Roeg and producer Jeremy Thomas, stills gallery and 16 deleted scenes. However, the laziness that has crept into some recent Criterion discs is evident in the latter: while 8 of those deleted scenes have no soundtrack, surely it wouldn't have been asking too much of Criterion to have included subtitles for the missing dialogue or at least to have included an introductory caption explaining the scenes? It's an irritating blemish on an otherwise excellent disc.",5,Roeg's last great film: a troubled picture about a troubled romance,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,3689,"['Seen', 'quarter', 'century', ""'Bad"", 'Timing', 'out', 'one', 'Nicolas', 'Roeg', 'most', 'satisfying', 'complex', 'films', 'yet', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'hardest', 'discuss', 'film', 'feel', 'little', 'guilty', 'writing', 'so', 'little', 'even', 'second', 'viewing', 'still', 'rather', 'overwhelming', 'interesting', 'how', 'be', 'so', 'genuinely', 'multi-layered', 'more', 'novel', 'film', 'way', 'voyeurism', 'spying', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'legal', 'investigation', 'Keitel', 'investigation', 'suicide', 'scene', 'placing', 'firmly', 'scenes', 'unseen', 'voyeur', 'Terry', 'Rawlings', 'typically', 'brilliant', 'editing', 'remarkable', 'enough', 'film', 'manages', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'besides', 'performances', 'are', 'incredibly', 'brave', 'how', 'many', 'leading', 'men', 'can', 'think', 'who', 'would', 'effectively', 'quite', 'deliberately', 'effeminately', 'play', 'woman', 'role', 'lovers', 'initial', 'meeting', 'Russell', 'particular', 'shows', 'astonishing', 'range', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'impossible', 'part', 'making', 'inability', 'find', 'decent', 'roles', 'days', 'even', 'more', 'disappointing.True', 'apart', 'last', 'couple', 'reels', 'when', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'ring', 'true', 'still', 'last', 'great', 'film', 'Nic', 'Roeg', 'made', 'settling', 'prolific', 'mediocrity', 'brilliantly', 'edited', 'post-mortem', 'mutually', 'destructive', 'relationship', 'rather', 'police', 'mystery', 'really', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'work', 'Much', 'more', 'impressive', 'remembered', 'not', 'feelgood', 'movie', 'anything', 'date', 'movie', 'hell', 'remarkably', 'ambitious', 'accomplished', 'one.So', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'little-known', 'perhaps', 'even', 'less-seen', 'Well', 'be', 'down', 'bad', 'luck', 'bad', 'timing', 'own.In', 'US', 'hit', 'censorship', 'problems', 'Europe', 'had', 'major', 'problems', 'distribution', 'was', 'one', 'Rank', 'last', 'full', 'slate', 'British', 'productions', 'so', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'guaranteed', 'circuit', 'release', 'Odeon', 'chain', 'UK', 'Unfortunately', 'head', 'Rank', 'Theatres', 'was', 'so', 'disgusted', 'film', 'Rank', 'Organisation', 'was', 'originally', 'started', 'make', 'religious', 'films', 'many', 'old', 'guard', 'were', 'still', 'place', '1980', 'refused', 'book', 'single', 'one', 'theatres', 'only', 'Rank', 'film', 'be', 'so', ""'honored"", 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'enamoured', 'Eagle', 'Wing', 'second', 'biggest', 'circuit', 'was', 'owned', 'Rank', 'biggest', 'rival', 'EMI', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'interested', 'helping', 'out', 'balance', 'sheet', 'ended', 'up', 'Lew', 'Grade', 'very', 'small', 'Classic', 'chain', 'Rank', 'distribution', 'Europe', 'was', 'more', 'enthusiastic', 'course', 'Roeg', 'next', 'most', 'expensive', 'film', 'Eureka', 'had', 'even', 'bigger', 'problems', 'being', 'pulled', 'couple', 'weeks', 'opening', 'due', 'libel', 'lawsuit', 'kept', 'shelf', 'years', 'then', 'not', 'really', 'successful', 'brave', 'try', 'Cold', 'Heaven', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'director', 'hire', 'slew', 'disappointing', 'pictures', 'cable', 'movies', 'result', 'been', 'very', 'hard', 'track', 'down', 'original', 'release', 'well', 'effort', ""'re"", 'looking', 'challenging', 'fare.Criterion', 'DVD', 'much', 'better', 'transfer', 'UK', 'DVD', 'only', 'trailer', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'extras', 'package', 'interviews', 'Russell', 'Roeg', 'producer', 'Jeremy', 'Thomas', 'gallery', '16', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'However', 'laziness', 'crept', 'recent', 'Criterion', 'discs', 'evident', 'latter', '8', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'have', 'soundtrack', 'surely', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'asking', 'too', 'much', 'Criterion', 'have', 'included', 'subtitles', 'missing', 'dialogue', 'least', 'have', 'included', 'introductory', 'caption', 'explaining', 'scenes', 'irritating', 'blemish', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'disc']",Bad Timing
622696,A31D8QKJXU93BT,B00005JMVQ,"Vince Perrin ""Byline""","[15, 35]","Unseen for decades due to censorship and copyright issues, this 1980 film has a legendary status that its DVD debut, from The Criterion Collection, dispels. Time has not been kind to ""Bad Timing"" nor to its staccato editing and sexual frankness. You can't sit through it without losing patience. All of the characters answer questions with questions and are self-absorbed, self-centered and self-analytical; none is in the least engaging save perhaps a detective investigating a suicide. The weird casting includes a photo cameo by its apparent inspiration, Sigmund Freud.A trashy Army brat (Theresa Russell) leaves her husband (the reliable Denholm Elliot), seduces an insufferable American academic (Art Garfunkel), and commits suicide when he resists her emotional blackmail, having sick obsessions of his own. This story, set in Cold War Vienna, is told from the end to the middle and from the middle to the beginning, all at the same time. Director Nicholas Roeg used a similar technique in ""Don't Look Now."" Here it calls attention to itself, which may be a relief. You can admire the artistry without caring about the characters, who behave like people you would rather not know anyway.Even the detective, in an uncharacteristic quiet turn by Harvey Keitel, gets on your nerves (how could he not?) In her first big role, Russell (who later married Roeg) plays a slut given to pouting and hysterics; she articulates every cliche, sinking her performance. Garfunkel is into his irritating character but out of his element. Nymphomania and necrophilia are strange bedfellows here. Big Tobacco will be pleased, however, because everybody lights up in virtually every scene, and so often it's not only noticeable but poignant (all of these characters are doubtless dead by now.)",3,Smoke Gets In Your Eyes,1132358400,"11 19, 2005",2005,1780,"['Unseen', 'decades', 'due', 'censorship', 'copyright', 'issues', '1980', 'film', 'legendary', 'status', 'DVD', 'debut', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'dispels', 'Time', 'not', 'been', 'kind', 'Bad', 'Timing', 'staccato', 'editing', 'sexual', 'frankness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'losing', 'patience', 'characters', 'answer', 'questions', 'questions', 'are', 'self-absorbed', 'self-centered', 'self-analytical', 'none', 'least', 'engaging', 'save', 'perhaps', 'detective', 'investigating', 'suicide', 'weird', 'casting', 'photo', 'cameo', 'apparent', 'inspiration', 'Sigmund', 'Freud.A', 'trashy', 'Army', 'brat', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'husband', 'reliable', 'Denholm', 'Elliot', 'insufferable', 'American', 'academic', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'commits', 'suicide', 'when', 'emotional', 'blackmail', 'having', 'sick', 'obsessions', 'own', 'story', 'set', 'Cold', 'War', 'Vienna', 'told', 'end', 'middle', 'middle', 'beginning', 'same', 'time', 'Director', 'Nicholas', 'Roeg', 'used', 'similar', 'technique', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Now', 'Here', 'attention', 'may', 'be', 'relief', 'can', 'admire', 'artistry', 'caring', 'characters', 'who', 'behave', 'people', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'know', 'anyway.Even', 'detective', 'uncharacteristic', 'quiet', 'turn', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'nerves', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'first', 'big', 'role', 'Russell', 'who', 'later', 'married', 'Roeg', 'slut', 'given', 'pouting', 'hysterics', 'cliche', 'sinking', 'performance', 'Garfunkel', 'irritating', 'character', 'element', 'Nymphomania', 'necrophilia', 'are', 'strange', 'bedfellows', 'here', 'Big', 'Tobacco', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'however', 'everybody', 'up', 'virtually', 'scene', 'so', 'often', 'not', 'only', 'noticeable', 'poignant', 'characters', 'are', 'doubtless', 'dead', 'now']",Bad Timing
622697,A1ET8SZ6FNUH1F,B00005JMVQ,William R. Ray,"[1, 2]","DVD transfer:  Color film is very good to excellent.I have to agree with another reviewer that Art Garfunkel is a long way from acceptable as a leading man, even an actor.  His deadpan style coupled with a rather ""non-hunk"" face and physique fail to project a character sexually obsessed with another.  Theresa Russell carries her part as the flawed woman who thrives on male adoration but once that's achieved she loses interest, moving on to the next man (victim?).  For the most part, the film concerns itself with the relationship between Malena (Russell) and Alex (Garfunkel).  Denholm Elliott (the ""Indiana Jones"" series) plays Malena's husband who still hangs on the to the edges.The story is told in flashback form so it takes a little while to grasp the story.  There are some tough moments in the film which might offend some.  One is where Malena flashes herself at Alex suggesting that the only thing he wants is sex.  Another moment is Alex having sex with Malena when she is dying of an overdose of meds.  (note:  he thinks she is drunk and will come out of it later).  These two scenes were enough to have distributor, Rank, refuse to book the film into any of its theatres.  So, Bad Timing is a rarely seen effort from the past (1980).Recommended for:  Theresa Russell fans or those who wish to see how a personality disorder can destroy a relationship. A 3-star rating may be too high for this DVD but Russell is worth the watch.  NC-17 (rather than the ""R"" presented) is the rating I would use....absolutely no children.",3,Sexual obsession and personality disorders,1299196800,"03 4, 2011",2011,1538,"['DVD', 'transfer', 'Color', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'excellent.I', 'have', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'long', 'way', 'acceptable', 'leading', 'man', 'even', 'actor', 'deadpan', 'style', 'coupled', 'rather', 'non-hunk', 'face', 'physique', 'fail', 'project', 'character', 'sexually', 'obsessed', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'part', 'flawed', 'woman', 'who', 'male', 'adoration', 'once', 'achieved', 'interest', 'moving', 'next', 'man', 'victim', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'concerns', 'relationship', 'Malena', 'Russell', 'Alex', 'Garfunkel', 'Denholm', 'Elliott', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'series', 'Malena', 'husband', 'who', 'still', 'edges.The', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'form', 'little', 'grasp', 'story', 'are', 'tough', 'moments', 'film', 'might', 'offend', 'One', 'where', 'Malena', 'Alex', 'suggesting', 'only', 'thing', 'sex', 'moment', 'Alex', 'having', 'sex', 'Malena', 'when', 'dying', 'overdose', 'meds', 'note', 'drunk', 'will', 'come', 'later', 'two', 'scenes', 'were', 'enough', 'have', 'distributor', 'Rank', 'refuse', 'book', 'film', 'theatres', 'So', 'Bad', 'Timing', 'rarely', 'seen', 'effort', 'past', '1980', '.Recommended', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'fans', 'who', 'wish', 'see', 'how', 'personality', 'disorder', 'can', 'destroy', 'relationship', '3-star', 'rating', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'high', 'DVD', 'Russell', 'watch', 'NC-17', 'rather', 'R', 'presented', 'rating', 'would', 'use', '.absolutely', 'children']",Bad Timing
