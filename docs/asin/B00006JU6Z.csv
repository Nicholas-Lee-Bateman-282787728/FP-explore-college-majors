And so fans of Kari Wuhrer gets to see her do sex scenes in the movie. I think the movie does pretty good keeping you tuned in, in between the nudity, as there is drama and good story. But it is essentially a movie for Kari Wuhrer fans since she is lead actress, lead character, and we get to see her nude.",4,"A Sexy Movie, Erotic Thriller",1266105600,"02 14, 2010",2010,414,"['think', 'movie', 'genre', 'erotic', 'thriller', 'Basicly', 'movie', 'nude', 'scenes', 'so', 'fans', 'Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'see', 'do', 'sex', 'scenes', 'movie', 'think', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'keeping', 'tuned', 'nudity', 'drama', 'good', 'story', 'essentially', 'movie', 'Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'fans', 'lead', 'actress', 'lead', 'character', 'get', 'see', 'nude']",Spider's Web

Why couldnt it of been passion and canoles? The 2 are after a crapload of money, and both become entangled with one another, but can they trust each other. Boring, with way too much bad acting.

I liked the movie though a couple of scenes diddn't make sense, but I laughed at how great the ending was. I think how they got to the point of the plot of the movie, was nebulous at the least. I never thought that's what the movie'd be about. Some scenes of Stephen not liking his father or his father making condescending remarks (Freeloader, loser, good for nothing) would have worked. But set that aside, it's pretty much a good movie. It has trailers on it and that's it. Some of the trailers don't look good, but this one was a keeper, i might buy it even.
