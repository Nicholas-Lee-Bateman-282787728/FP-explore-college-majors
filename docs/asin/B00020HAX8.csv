I just have a hard time accepting David Caruso in the lead role because he is a bona fide crappy actor whose character should be tortured in every film and is in the same league, the Marlon Brando of phony acting, as Brad Dourif. Watching him and Nicolas Cage together in the same frame, there is simply no contest. In a little amount of screen time, Nicolas Cage is really mesmerizing and steals every scene he is in. He is the sole reason why I decided to see the film again. However, I feel he is underutilized as the Little Junior character. He can be much more in a Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth way. Samuel Jackson turns in a good, solid performance. I like to think of Kiss of Death as a Miami Vice reunion of actors who made cameos with, I believe, at least six of them in the film (Ving Rhames, Stanley Tucci, Anthony Heald, Philip Baker Hall, Paul Calderon, and Jay Sanders) appearing in different episodes during the 80's.

I saw the trailer for this, and they had the Chambers Brothers doing ""Time Has Come Today""; to me that's the ultimate freak out song, so I was expecting this to be extremely intense movie. I wasn't disappointed from the acting in the movie as Nicholas Cage and David Cauruso turned in stellar performances. The plot is actually better than the original as Cage plays a real sociopath....especially with the scene where one guy begins groping a dance girl because he was stoned drunk, and Cage gives the impression that he's going to burn the guys hand with a lit cigarette. I had to cover my eyes because of weak stomach, but then made him dance in his underwear I cracked up laughing because it was just too hilarious, and I was still thinking the hand was going to get burned.Well anyway this flick is about a criminal that is trying to stay on the straight and narrow after being left out of prison, but his cousin talks him into one more crime as he's in trouble. However, things do not go well, and the criminal ends up back in jail. His family is torn apart as his wife is killed in a car accident, and it was his cousin's fault. The criminal is released from prison, and is confronted by the police officer played by Samuel L. Jackson who arrested him, and wants him to bring donw the crime family. There's non-stop thrills, and tons of good crime drama here including a classic fight between Cage's and Cauruso's characters. With all the good things I put on here you would think that I would give it 5 stars, but as I said there's one little thing missing, and I sat through the whole movie right down to the credits to hear ""Time Has Come Today"", and it never came.

Stanley Tucci shone as the implacable agent behind the traces of Kilmartin. This is the actor that (in my personal opinion would have reached the peak performance as Gerard Lieutenant in The Fugitive despite the fact Tommy Lee Jones won the Oscar). Tucci has been underestimated by most directors in films like this. Imagine a film with Tucci and  Chezz Palmitieri together in a mob movie. Well there is still time to do it.Nicholas Cage looked extremely overacted, Vig Rhames is far to convince too. These two performances demerit the dramatic balance of the film, pitifully.

820130,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00020HAX8,Stephanie De Pue,"[1, 1]","Kiss of Death.  This stylish 101 minute 1995 crime thriller is based on the same story as the classic 1947 Hollywood  film noir of the same name.  It features an unusually star-laden cast, and, at a cost of $40 million, with returns of $14 million, was not judged a  success.David Caruso plays Jimmy Kilmartin an ex-con, caught red-handed during a heist, who tries to distance himself from his past upon his release and lead an honorable life.  But he reluctantly agrees to help Ronnie Gannon, (Michael Rapaport), his loser cousin, with one last heist that goes wrong.  He refuses to rat out his underworld pals, but turns stoolie after they renege on their promises to him.  Coerced by Frank Zioli, (Stanley Tucci), an ambitious prosecutor, he agrees to play the pawn in a police plot to bring down Little Junior Brown, (Nicholas Cage), a psychotic gangster.  Helen Hunt plays Jimmy's wife Bev; Samuel L. Jackson plays Calvin Hart, an angry cop.  Ving Rhames plays Omar, a psychotic Philadelphia-based mobster.  Philip Baker Hall plays Big Junior Brown; Anthony Heald plays a fed.  Comedienne Anne Meara plays Bev's mother.Not a bad cast, and by and large, well-acted.  As the lead, Caruso was very good at intensity and suffering stoically when receiving filmic punishment.  He was paid $1 M for this gig, which he squeezed in in the hiatus between the first and short-lived second season of the phenomenally successful television show NYPD Blue.  As many viewers will remember, he soon left the TV series in order to pursue a full-time film career, which failed to go anywhere.  He doesn't really carry this picture very well.  (Personally, I've always thought he was just too much of a skinny malink, as we used to say in Brooklyn,  to play substantial roles.)In fact, the acting in the '95 film just doesn't compare to the '47 take.  Richard Widmark nabbed an Oscar for his memorable debut as the sadistic mobster; Victor Mature turned in star-caliber work as the two bit hood.  Brian Donlevy and Coleen Gray added heft.  Both versions were based on a story by Bronxite Eleazar Lipsky.  The '47 screenplay was by the near-legendary team of Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer, directed by Henry Hathaway.  The '95 version was by acclaimed Bronx, New York novelist Richard Price, no slouch at depicting the underworld, directed by the respected Barbet Schroeder.  Both versions well-written and -directed.  They transmit the look of the New York of their times; the less picturesque bits that tourists never see.  The newer is, of course, in color, while the older is in black and white, perhaps more suited to the city.  The newer version also has a lot more profanity, blood and gore, which, I guess, are not to everyone's taste.  Still, it's OK, but I expect demanding viewers had better stick with the original.",3,Demanding Viewers Had Better Stick With the Original,1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,2813,"['Kiss', 'Death', 'stylish', '101', 'minute', '1995', 'crime', 'thriller', 'based', 'same', 'story', 'classic', '1947', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'noir', 'same', 'name', 'unusually', 'star-laden', 'cast', 'cost', '40', 'million', 'returns', '14', 'million', 'was', 'not', 'judged', 'success.David', 'Caruso', 'Jimmy', 'Kilmartin', 'ex-con', 'caught', 'red-handed', 'heist', 'who', 'distance', 'past', 'release', 'lead', 'honorable', 'life', 'reluctantly', 'help', 'Ronnie', 'Gannon', 'Michael', 'Rapaport', 'loser', 'cousin', 'one', 'last', 'heist', 'wrong', 'rat', 'out', 'underworld', 'pals', 'stoolie', 'renege', 'promises', 'Coerced', 'Frank', 'Zioli', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'ambitious', 'prosecutor', 'play', 'pawn', 'police', 'plot', 'bring', 'down', 'Little', 'Junior', 'Brown', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'psychotic', 'gangster', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Jimmy', 'wife', 'Bev', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Calvin', 'Hart', 'angry', 'cop', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'plays', 'Omar', 'psychotic', 'Philadelphia-based', 'mobster', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'Big', 'Junior', 'Brown', 'Anthony', 'Heald', 'fed', 'Comedienne', 'Anne', 'Meara', 'Bev', 'mother.Not', 'bad', 'cast', 'large', 'well-acted', 'lead', 'Caruso', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'intensity', 'suffering', 'stoically', 'when', 'receiving', 'filmic', 'punishment', 'was', 'paid', '1', 'M', 'gig', 'squeezed', 'hiatus', 'first', 'short-lived', 'second', 'season', 'phenomenally', 'successful', 'television', 'show', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'remember', 'soon', 'left', 'TV', 'series', 'order', 'pursue', 'full-time', 'film', 'career', 'failed', 'go', 'anywhere', ""n't"", 'really', 'carry', 'picture', 'very', 'well', 'Personally', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'skinny', 'malink', 'used', 'say', 'Brooklyn', 'play', 'substantial', 'roles', 'fact', 'acting', ""'95"", 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'compare', ""'47"", 'take', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'nabbed', 'Oscar', 'memorable', 'debut', 'sadistic', 'mobster', 'Victor', 'Mature', 'turned', 'star-caliber', 'work', 'two', 'bit', 'hood', 'Brian', 'Donlevy', 'Coleen', 'Gray', 'added', 'heft', 'versions', 'were', 'based', 'story', 'Bronxite', 'Eleazar', 'Lipsky', ""'47"", 'screenplay', 'was', 'near-legendary', 'team', 'Ben', 'Hecht', 'Charles', 'Lederer', 'directed', 'Henry', 'Hathaway', ""'95"", 'version', 'was', 'acclaimed', 'Bronx', 'New', 'York', 'novelist', 'Richard', 'Price', 'slouch', 'depicting', 'underworld', 'directed', 'respected', 'Barbet', 'Schroeder', 'versions', 'well-written', '-directed', 'transmit', 'look', 'New', 'York', 'times', 'less', 'picturesque', 'bits', 'never', 'see', 'newer', 'course', 'color', 'older', 'black', 'white', 'perhaps', 'more', 'suited', 'city', 'newer', 'version', 'also', 'lot', 'more', 'profanity', 'blood', 'gore', 'guess', 'are', 'not', 'everyone', 'taste', 'Still', 'OK', 'expect', 'demanding', 'viewers', 'had', 'better', 'stick', 'original']",N/A
