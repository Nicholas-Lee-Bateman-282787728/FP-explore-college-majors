1660217,A29K6FQJ7PWQ19,B00DP3E2HG,mr. impulse buyer,"[14, 17]","My son has been a fan of Thomas and Friends movies for over two and a half years now (he turned 4 in August).  Each one he has seen brings fun and good life lessons throughout.  This one is really no different.  The movie's description at the top should suffice for what this tale is about.King of The Railway shares many similarities with the other Thomas and Friends movies (which doesn't hurt this most recent film).  Thomas is always learning an important lesson, while those around him witness some of the issues brought up by said lesson.  Gordon and Spencer debate about the ""fastest engine on Sodor."" Percy gets bashful and inquisitive on occasion.  James worries about his paint. Thomas tries to keep a secret that conflicts with making others happy.  Discovering/Seeing a 'new' engine that needs repairing.  All of these themes should be familiar if you've seen any of the previous movies, but nevertheless, play well into this new adaptation.  It's done in a way that doesn't quite seem 'old hat.'The fresh spin on this particular film seems to be a nod towards the usefulness of the elderly.  Stephen, the 'new' broken down engine tells stories of long ago, when he was known as the ""Rocket,"" for his speed.  But because of the strength and speed of today's engines, he has been left behind for quite some time. The Earl of Sodor has a special job for Stephen, but doesn't want to reveal it until the time is right.  So the Earl entrusts Thomas to remain quiet about it until that time comes.  Thomas sees that Stephen really WANTS to be useful, but what use could an ""old, broken down engine"" be put to?  Since it's in his nature to please those around him, Thomas becomes conflicted about his promise to the Earl in wanting to tell Stephen about his intended purpose.  The viewer is also introduced to three other new engines: Conner, Kaitlyn, and Millie, all with small roles of their own.  The rest, you'll have to watch, since I intend to keep this spoiler-free.As far as the quality of the DVD goes, I must admit that this movie is the best picture quality I've seen on a standard DVD.  My wife and I were going to get the Blu Ray version, but it wasn't in stock at the time, and my child had really wanted to watch this movie.  So we picked up the standard version and popped it in the player.  Crisp, bright colors, very little line blurring, and lots of detail filled the screen (with no letterboxing).  The audio is just as nice, blending the background, vocal, and music levels to their appropriate heights.  We found that we didn't have to play with the volume when the trains were talking.Overall, I'd call this a perfect fit for anyone's Thomas Collection (even if some of it seems repetitive).  They visit locations from previous films, along with some cameos from those movies.  You might find that you'll get a kick out of it as much as your kids do.  Mine asked to watch it again the very next day.  Worth the price for the standard DVD, but if Blu Ray is your preference, go for it.  I think there is only a five dollar difference between the two.",5,Freshens up some more of the same...,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,3078,"['son', 'been', 'fan', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'movies', 'two', 'half', 'years', 'now', 'turned', '4', 'August', 'one', 'seen', 'brings', 'fun', 'good', 'life', 'lessons', 'one', 'really', 'different', 'movie', 'description', 'top', 'should', 'suffice', 'what', 'tale', 'about.King', 'Railway', 'shares', 'many', 'similarities', 'other', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'movies', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'most', 'recent', 'film', 'Thomas', 'always', 'learning', 'important', 'lesson', 'witness', 'issues', 'brought', 'up', 'said', 'lesson', 'Gordon', 'Spencer', 'debate', 'fastest', 'engine', 'Sodor', 'Percy', 'bashful', 'inquisitive', 'occasion', 'James', 'paint', 'Thomas', 'keep', 'secret', 'making', 'others', 'happy', 'Discovering/Seeing', ""'new"", 'engine', 'repairing', 'themes', 'should', 'be', 'familiar', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'previous', 'movies', 'nevertheless', 'play', 'well', 'new', 'adaptation', 'done', 'way', ""n't"", 'quite', 'seem', 'hat', 'fresh', 'spin', 'particular', 'film', 'be', 'nod', 'usefulness', 'elderly', 'Stephen', ""'new"", 'broken', 'down', 'engine', 'tells', 'stories', 'long', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'known', 'Rocket', 'speed', 'strength', 'speed', 'today', 'engines', 'been', 'left', 'quite', 'time', 'Earl', 'Sodor', 'special', 'job', 'Stephen', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'time', 'right', 'Earl', 'Thomas', 'remain', 'quiet', 'time', 'Thomas', 'Stephen', 'really', 'WANTS', 'be', 'useful', 'what', 'use', 'could', 'old', 'broken', 'down', 'engine', 'be', 'put', 'nature', 'please', 'Thomas', 'becomes', 'conflicted', 'promise', 'Earl', 'wanting', 'tell', 'Stephen', 'intended', 'purpose', 'viewer', 'also', 'introduced', 'three', 'other', 'new', 'engines', 'Conner', 'Kaitlyn', 'Millie', 'small', 'roles', 'own', 'rest', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'intend', 'keep', 'spoiler-free.As', 'far', 'quality', 'DVD', 'must', 'admit', 'movie', 'best', 'picture', 'quality', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'standard', 'DVD', 'wife', 'were', 'going', 'get', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'was', ""n't"", 'stock', 'time', 'child', 'had', 'really', 'wanted', 'watch', 'movie', 'picked', 'up', 'standard', 'version', 'popped', 'player', 'Crisp', 'bright', 'colors', 'very', 'little', 'line', 'blurring', 'lots', 'detail', 'filled', 'screen', 'letterboxing', 'audio', 'just', 'nice', 'blending', 'background', 'vocal', 'music', 'levels', 'appropriate', 'heights', 'found', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'play', 'volume', 'when', 'trains', 'were', 'talking.Overall', ""'d"", 'call', 'perfect', 'fit', 'anyone', 'Thomas', 'Collection', 'even', 'repetitive', 'visit', 'locations', 'previous', 'films', 'cameos', 'movies', 'might', 'find', ""'ll"", 'get', 'kick', 'as', 'much', 'kids', 'do', 'Mine', 'asked', 'watch', 'again', 'very', 'next', 'day', 'price', 'standard', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'preference', 'go', 'think', 'only', 'five', 'dollar', 'difference', 'two']",N/A

As he's gotten older and his attention span longer, he seems less interested in the regular show that's just around ten minutes long. He has been anxiously awaiting the release of the next Thomas movie that he could really get into so it was a happy day when we got King of the Railway in the mail!After seeing so many Thomas DVD's I am almost as familiar with them as Reed and I noticed some differences in this movie right away. Everything seems to be a bit more modern and updated from the music to the plot to the newly introduced characters. Thomas has been around for a long time so it's refreshing to see it updated every once in a while.I really enjoyed watching this movie with my kids! I always like movies with a good plot and life lessons for my kids. Thomas and his Friends are great examples of working together and solving problems and this movie is no exception.Paige was really into this movie too because of the ""royal"" theme since she in fact thinks she's royalty and the new trains included two new girl engines. We think it's about time some new ladies joined them! Paige has always been into the ""boy"" shows and toys and most of them only have a couple token girl characters so it's always nice when there's new ones she can enjoy as well.In our house Thomas &  Friends: King of the Railway is the true royal event of the year!",5,Royal Event of the Year,1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,1481,"['five', 'year', 'old', 'was', 'train', 'lover', 'practically', 'birth', 'was', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'gotten', 'older', 'attention', 'span', 'longer', 'less', 'interested', 'regular', 'show', 'just', 'around', 'ten', 'minutes', 'long', 'been', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'release', 'next', 'Thomas', 'movie', 'could', 'really', 'get', 'was', 'happy', 'day', 'when', 'got', 'King', 'Railway', 'mail', 'seeing', 'so', 'many', 'Thomas', 'DVD', 'am', 'almost', 'familiar', 'Reed', 'noticed', 'differences', 'movie', 'right', 'away', 'Everything', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'modern', 'updated', 'music', 'plot', 'newly', 'introduced', 'characters', 'Thomas', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'refreshing', 'see', 'updated', 'once', 'while.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'kids', 'always', 'movies', 'good', 'plot', 'life', 'lessons', 'kids', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'are', 'great', 'examples', 'working', 'together', 'solving', 'problems', 'movie', 'exception.Paige', 'was', 'really', 'movie', 'too', 'royal', 'theme', 'fact', 'royalty', 'new', 'trains', 'included', 'two', 'new', 'girl', 'engines', 'think', 'time', 'new', 'ladies', 'joined', 'Paige', 'always', 'been', 'boy', 'shows', 'toys', 'most', 'only', 'have', 'couple', 'token', 'girl', 'characters', 'always', 'nice', 'when', 'new', 'ones', 'can', 'enjoy', 'well.In', 'house', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'King', 'Railway', 'true', 'royal', 'event', 'year']",N/A
