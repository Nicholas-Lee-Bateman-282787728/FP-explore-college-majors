47161,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783219148,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I was never a huge `Flipper' fan.  I didn't watch the television show and I never saw the 1963 film that inspired it.  I do recall seeing this particular movie when I was younger, but I didn't given it a second thought.  As far as deep-sea animal movies I preferred `Jaws', and, well, I did absolutely LOVE `Free Willy', but that's for another discussion.So, anyways, my wife, she's the `Flipper' fan.  She just adores this movie and so the other night she made me watch it with her, and guess what; it was actually quite good.So, for those of you not aware, this is a move about a dolphin who befriends a boy in need of a friend.  Young Sandy Ricks is depressed since his parents recently divorced.  He is longing for some normalcy, but instead his mother decides to ship him off to Coral Key to spend the summer with his crazy Uncle Porter.  Sandy is apposed to it at first, but then he meets Flipper, a friendly dolphin who shows Sandy the meaning of friendship.Throughout the film Sandy not only bonds with Flipper but also with his Uncle, which is something Porter needed as well.  Add to that a young girl who catches Sandy's eye and an evil fisherman who is poisoning the water and you have an adventure suited for the whole family.Sure, `Flipper' is nothing truly special.  It is nothing new or unpredictable.  In fact, you can guess pretty much every upcoming scene long before it appears, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good time; and films like this that are targeted at a family and a young audience are not designed to truly amaze or surprise you.  They are designed to capture the hearts of young ones and their parents, and `Flipper' truly does that.The acting is quite good for a film of this genre, especially from young Frodo; I mean Elijah Wood.  He shows possibly more depth here than I've ever seen him since.  Paul Hogan does a surprisingly fine job as Porter, making his relationship with Sandy seem a lot more real than it could have.But of course this movie is all about the dolphin, and he does steal the show.So, if you are looking for a fun family film that is packed with adventure, humor and a chatty little sea-faring animal than this may just be the film you are looking for.  It's not amazing, but it doesn't have to be.  It is better than average, that's for sure, and with the slew of average films being released today it's nice to find one that is ahead of the pack.",4,Boatloads of fun...,1229472000,"12 17, 2008",2008,2405,"['was', 'never', 'huge', 'Flipper', 'fan', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'television', 'show', 'never', 'saw', '1963', 'film', 'inspired', 'do', 'recall', 'seeing', 'particular', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'did', ""n't"", 'given', 'second', 'thought', 'As', 'far', 'deep-sea', 'animal', 'movies', 'preferred', 'Jaws', 'well', 'did', 'absolutely', 'LOVE', 'Free', 'Willy', 'discussion.So', 'anyways', 'wife', 'Flipper', 'fan', 'just', 'movie', 'so', 'other', 'night', 'made', 'watch', 'guess', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'good.So', 'not', 'aware', 'move', 'dolphin', 'who', 'boy', 'need', 'friend', 'Young', 'Sandy', 'Ricks', 'depressed', 'parents', 'recently', 'divorced', 'longing', 'normalcy', 'instead', 'mother', 'ship', 'off', 'Coral', 'Key', 'spend', 'summer', 'crazy', 'Uncle', 'Porter', 'Sandy', 'apposed', 'first', 'then', 'Flipper', 'friendly', 'dolphin', 'who', 'Sandy', 'meaning', 'friendship.Throughout', 'film', 'Sandy', 'not', 'only', 'bonds', 'Flipper', 'also', 'Uncle', 'something', 'Porter', 'needed', 'as', 'well', 'Add', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'Sandy', 'eye', 'evil', 'fisherman', 'who', 'poisoning', 'water', 'have', 'adventure', 'suited', 'whole', 'family.Sure', 'Flipper', 'nothing', 'truly', 'special', 'nothing', 'new', 'unpredictable', 'fact', 'can', 'guess', 'pretty', 'much', 'upcoming', 'scene', 'long', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'good', 'time', 'films', 'are', 'targeted', 'family', 'young', 'audience', 'are', 'not', 'designed', 'truly', 'amaze', 'surprise', 'are', 'designed', 'capture', 'hearts', 'young', 'ones', 'parents', 'Flipper', 'truly', 'that.The', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'film', 'genre', 'especially', 'young', 'Frodo', 'mean', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'possibly', 'more', 'depth', 'here', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'surprisingly', 'fine', 'job', 'Porter', 'making', 'relationship', 'Sandy', 'seem', 'lot', 'more', 'real', 'could', 'have.But', 'course', 'movie', 'dolphin', 'steal', 'show.So', 'are', 'looking', 'fun', 'family', 'film', 'packed', 'adventure', 'humor', 'chatty', 'little', 'sea-faring', 'animal', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'film', 'are', 'looking', 'not', 'amazing', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'better', 'average', 'sure', 'slew', 'average', 'films', 'being', 'released', 'today', 'nice', 'find', 'one', 'ahead', 'pack']",N/A

It's very cute and quite funny in places, has decent acting and of course the dolphin is simply delightful!Sandy (played by a tender Elijah Wood) is a rebellious teenager from Chicago who is sent to stay with his Uncle (aussie Paul Hogan) over the summer. Thinking there will be NOTHING to do accept fish on a crummy boat for 8 weeks, Sandy finds pleasure out of being difficult and objective. However things take a turn when he saves the life of a friendly and intelligent dolphin, who later on becomes known as Flipper and the two soon develop a strong friendship.Being an Australian, it was great to see an old classic in this movie to bring a little something extra. Elijah Wood did a wonderful job i thought! Best known for his portrayal as Frodo in the ""lord of the rings"" Wood shows real profession at such a young age.And i wont finish without mentioning the beautiful dolphin! Those animals are such a joy to watch because you can really sense that they are smiling! He was simply beautiful! Children are going to love the several sequences in which Flipper dives and plays in the water. Beautiful cinematography!So in conclusion, ""Flipper"" is just wonderfully light and fun escape from heavier films and the other destractions of life. It'll make you wanna jump in the pool and you will laugh in several places.

47169,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,0783219148,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 2]","Not being a fan of '60s TV, I never watched the originalFlipperseries, but there is something that continually draws me to these stories about children with unusual friends, and when there's a dolphin involved, my interest is piqued even more. However, even after a couple viewings, I'm not sure how much I like 1996's ""Flipper"": on a good day, it's a sweet story and a fine vehicle for its lead performers; on a bad day, it's a lightweightFree Willyand feels strangely contained. Either way, it's a fairly typical '90s family movie and, at least, a refreshing adventure from a time when it wasn't uncool to be environmentally conscious.The story: a disconnected teenager named Sandy (Elijah Wood,The Lord of the Rings series) finds a friend in a lost dolphin. As their bond grows, they will need to overcome great odds to save the tranquility of Flipper's ocean home and both of their lives from greedy polluters.It's never explained why Flipper takes such a shine to Sandy in the first place, and Jonathan Banks (Wiseguy) deserves a consolation award for portraying one of the most over-the-top jerk villains I've ever seen as the fisherman who's got it in for Flipper's life, but other than that, the film's writing is fine and the movie has a nice feel-good vibe. Paul Hogan - taking a break from hunting animals inCrocodile Dundee- stands out particularly as the eccentric-but-likeable uncle, and Flipper endears himself by being the best pal Elijah Wood's character probably ever had: not only does he splash around with Sandy in the water and save his life in the end, but he also makes him a lot of money as a dockside attraction and more or less gets him a girlfriend (Jessica Wesson,Casper); if that dolphin's not true & blue, I don't know which is.Apparently, Flipper was played by a combination of real dolphins and animatronics, but I really couldn't tell where one ended and the latter began, so the effects are pretty darn convincing. The Florida Keys setting also looks friendly and pretty authentic (the movie was filmed in the Bahamas), but as aforementioned, the film's scale feels slightly deficient: there are lapses where the sea definitely feels like an aquarium, and I got the feeling that a couple of the vistas were dangerously close to eachother on the shooting location - spitting distance, without much room for the camera to maneuver. Additionally, the story rarely conveys a feeling of legitimate peril or even a particularly strong sense of righteous indignation when it comes to its environment-raping, dolphin-snaring antagonists. In this sense, ""Flipper"" really does wade in the shadow of ""Free Willy"" as the emotional lightweight.Flipper's quite resourceful with his tail, using it to dropkick the villain into the ocean and smack Elijah Wood on the butt, and for some reason, this tidbit amuses me enough to keep the film in my personal collection. I guess I do like it quite a bit, but again, even though I don't know how it holds up against its source material, I can't help but think that it could've stood to be a bit bigger and a bit weightier. Were the movie made in the last decade instead of 1996, the script would've probably received a slightly more mature treatment that could've only improved the end product, but as things stand, this film's probably your best bet for family cinema starring dolphins.

47173,AW9ERFQZBVCO6,0783219148,The Night Falcon,"[6, 7]","I was alive when I saw the original movie released that lead to the TV series starring Luke Halpin and Tommy Norden.  I bought this film simply because I have loved Paul Hogan's work and adore Elijah Wood.  So I took a chance.In merit to this film and its premise, this film's take off of ""Flipper"" shows a more disfunctional family approach to the Ricks family we see in the old 1960's TV series.  Elijah Wood, who plays Sandy in this film, is sent to stay with Ranger Ricks for one summer. You presume Sandy's mother can not take care of him for the summer, while she pays Porter Ricks, played by Paul Hogan; $100 a week to take care of the boy. I don't know who can get by on $100 a week these days let alone in 2003 when this film was made.  Porter Ricks living conditions are quite a far cry from the clean environment and ethics taught in the old 1965 tv series. Since this film is drawing from the original characters created from the 1965 series, it makes sense to make a rough comparison.  This film in other words can not just be judged for its own merits alone, since it draws from the old 60's Tv series in premise.There is no sign of Bud in this film or hint to a sequel that might introduce him and frankly, it was the relationship between Flipper and Bud that made the old 1960's tv series work so well. Tommy Norden was not only a cute kid to watch, but had a fabulous personality as a young actor.The character development in this film needed allot of work, not to mention somekind of decent story line. In the opening, Sandy and Porter Ricks seem distant from each other and don't really seem that much closer by the time it all reaches the end of the film.Flipper appears into this half hazardly via Sandy witnessing some fishermen killing Flipper's mother and, for some reason, Flipper is drawn to Sandy after roaming the oceans with no pod or family.  How he finds Sandy isn't clear either when there is no earthly way a dolphin, as intelligent as Flipper, could have known where Sandy lived.I liked that Flipper tracked Sandy down in his lonliness, but it would have made more sense if Sandy had tried to rescue Flipper from the gunman, who shot Flipper's mother, which caused this bonding to take place, while leaving a clue for the dolphin to find Sandy.  You really have no idea why flipper is drawn to Sandy, other than the fact that Flipper gets lonily, in need of a family, and magically tracks him down.The dolphin in this movie is cute; that goes without saying.  Makes me think of the mechanical dolphin, named Darwin, they used in SeaQuest.I think this film would have had allot more going for it, if they had simply worked to create somekind of story that brings Ricks, Sandy and Flipper together via stuggle and need for each other. It seems the story was trying to do that along the way, but kept missing.Frankly, this story really does not go anywhere and that's ashame. You can read other reviews to get some idea of what the story is about. Otherwise I think the chemistry between Paul Hogan, as an actor, and Elijah Wood, as an actor, could have really worked in this film. They both are excellent actors when it comes down to it. It just seems the whole thing was slapped together with the idea in mind; ""This will sell, everyone loves Flipper"", but we also like a good story or it doesn't work.Also, as long as the character ""Sandy"" was going to be used in this remake, it makes no sense to take away Bud from the family profile; given this film is drawing from the original work of the original film and tv series of the 1960's.Cinematography wise; this film is done well, but I can see why it would have been hard to even make a sequel with this, simply because the story really goes no where or at least in a direction that might even suggest a sequel.I felt very lost at the end when Sandy goes home at summer's end to be with his mom: At least you think it is his mom, even though that isn't made clear in the script.  He's allowed to come back next summer to visit Porter Ricks, but the whole thing just comes apart with this type of ending when you consider the original premise of the Ricks family of the 1960's and that they were a family.  You don't see that happening here, even though the writer is drawing from the old 1960's series.  Too bad.I hate to give anything a number 2 rating.  Can't imagine how anyone could have blown it with something as delightful as Flipper, but this one really isn't worth your money. It's more a rental film or something to pass your time when nothing else is on tv to watch.",2,This chemistry just didn't work for me.,1181174400,"06 7, 2007",2007,4562,"['was', 'alive', 'when', 'saw', 'original', 'movie', 'released', 'lead', 'TV', 'series', 'starring', 'Luke', 'Halpin', 'Tommy', 'Norden', 'bought', 'film', 'simply', 'have', 'loved', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'work', 'adore', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'took', 'chance.In', 'merit', 'film', 'premise', 'film', 'take', 'off', 'Flipper', 'more', 'disfunctional', 'family', 'approach', 'Ricks', 'family', 'see', 'old', '1960', 'TV', 'series', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'who', 'Sandy', 'film', 'sent', 'stay', 'Ranger', 'Ricks', 'one', 'summer', 'presume', 'Sandy', 'mother', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'care', 'summer', 'Porter', 'Ricks', 'played', 'Paul', 'Hogan', '100', 'week', 'take', 'care', 'boy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'can', 'get', '100', 'week', 'days', 'let', 'alone', '2003', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Porter', 'Ricks', 'living', 'conditions', 'are', 'quite', 'far', 'cry', 'clean', 'environment', 'ethics', 'taught', 'old', '1965', 'tv', 'series', 'film', 'drawing', 'original', 'characters', 'created', '1965', 'series', 'sense', 'make', 'rough', 'comparison', 'film', 'other', 'words', 'can', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'judged', 'own', 'merits', 'alone', 'old', '60', 'Tv', 'series', 'premise.There', 'sign', 'Bud', 'film', 'hint', 'sequel', 'might', 'introduce', 'frankly', 'was', 'relationship', 'Flipper', 'Bud', 'made', 'old', '1960', 'tv', 'series', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'Tommy', 'Norden', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'cute', 'kid', 'watch', 'had', 'fabulous', 'personality', 'young', 'actor.The', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'needed', 'allot', 'work', 'not', 'mention', 'somekind', 'decent', 'story', 'line', 'opening', 'Sandy', 'Porter', 'Ricks', 'seem', 'distant', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'much', 'closer', 'time', 'end', 'film.Flipper', 'half', 'hazardly', 'Sandy', 'witnessing', 'fishermen', 'killing', 'Flipper', 'mother', 'reason', 'Flipper', 'drawn', 'Sandy', 'roaming', 'oceans', 'pod', 'family', 'How', 'Sandy', ""n't"", 'clear', 'either', 'when', 'earthly', 'way', 'dolphin', 'as', 'intelligent', 'Flipper', 'could', 'have', 'known', 'where', 'Sandy', 'liked', 'Flipper', 'tracked', 'Sandy', 'down', 'lonliness', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'Sandy', 'had', 'tried', 'rescue', 'Flipper', 'gunman', 'who', 'shot', 'Flipper', 'mother', 'caused', 'bonding', 'take', 'place', 'leaving', 'clue', 'dolphin', 'find', 'Sandy', 'really', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'flipper', 'drawn', 'Sandy', 'other', 'fact', 'Flipper', 'lonily', 'need', 'family', 'magically', 'down.The', 'dolphin', 'movie', 'cute', 'saying', 'Makes', 'think', 'mechanical', 'dolphin', 'named', 'Darwin', 'used', 'SeaQuest.I', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'allot', 'more', 'going', 'had', 'simply', 'worked', 'create', 'somekind', 'story', 'Ricks', 'Sandy', 'Flipper', 'together', 'stuggle', 'need', 'other', 'story', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'way', 'kept', 'missing.Frankly', 'story', 'really', 'not', 'go', 'anywhere', 'ashame', 'can', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'story', 'about', 'Otherwise', 'think', 'chemistry', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'actor', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'worked', 'film', 'are', 'excellent', 'actors', 'when', 'down', 'just', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'slapped', 'together', 'idea', 'mind', 'will', 'sell', 'everyone', 'Flipper', 'also', 'good', 'story', ""n't"", 'work.Also', 'as', 'long', 'character', 'Sandy', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'used', 'remake', 'sense', 'take', 'away', 'Bud', 'family', 'profile', 'given', 'film', 'drawing', 'original', 'work', 'original', 'film', 'tv', 'series', ""1960's.Cinematography"", 'wise', 'film', 'done', 'well', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'even', 'make', 'sequel', 'simply', 'story', 'really', 'where', 'least', 'direction', 'might', 'even', 'suggest', 'sequel.I', 'felt', 'very', 'lost', 'end', 'when', 'Sandy', 'home', 'summer', 'end', 'be', 'mom', 'least', 'think', 'mom', 'even', ""n't"", 'made', 'clear', 'script', 'allowed', 'come', 'back', 'next', 'summer', 'visit', 'Porter', 'Ricks', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'apart', 'type', 'ending', 'when', 'consider', 'original', 'premise', 'Ricks', 'family', '1960', 'were', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'happening', 'here', 'even', 'writer', 'drawing', 'old', '1960', 'series', 'Too', 'bad.I', 'hate', 'give', 'anything', 'number', '2', 'rating', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'blown', 'something', 'as', 'delightful', 'Flipper', 'one', 'really', ""n't"", 'worth', 'money', 'more', 'rental', 'film', 'something', 'pass', 'time', 'when', 'nothing', 'else', 'tv', 'watch']",N/A

47176,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,0783219148,trebe,"[0, 1]","The dolphin Flipper, originally appeared in a film of the same name released in 1963.  A television series called Flipper (1964-67) based on this film, ran for three seasons.  Very loosely based on the 1963 original film, Flipper (1996) seems to be an attempt to appeal to those who might fondly remember the movie or TV show some thirty years later, as well as families with children about ten and below.  As ""Flipper"" was then and probably still is now, the first name that comes to mind when you think about dolphins, it's understandable why a studio backed the project, even though the movie which is firmly aimed at a younger audience, doesn't have a great story to tell.Aside from utilizing a few character names, the movie is a total reboot of the Flipper story.  Porter Ricks (Paul Hogan) is a fisherman in the port town of Coral Key, who is taking care of his nephew Sandy Ricks (Elijah Wood), who has come from Chicago, to stay for the summer.  While out at sea, the Ricks observe Dirk Morgan (Jonathan Banks), a crazy tour operator, shooting at a dolphin with a rifle.  With a little help from Sandy, the dolphin manages to escape.Sandy isn't loving the way his summer is looking, but things change when the dolphin shows up and wants to be friends, and when he meets a young girl named Kim (Jessica Wesson), the dolphin acquires the name ""Flipper"".  Unfortunately there is a law against keeping a dolphin as a pet, and things are apparently slow around Coral Key, as Sheriff Buck Cowan (Isaac Hayes) forcibly removes the dolphin, and releases him out at sea.Flipper manages to find his way back to the Rick's home, but the poor animal is very sick.  Porter's girlfriend Cathy (Chelsea Field) helps to treat the animal, and they soon discover that Flipper has been poisoned.  Dirk Morgan is suspected of dumping toxic wastes at sea, setting the stage for a mildly exciting finish, in this mostly by the numbers adventure/comedy, that isn't too violent or scary for younger children.  In addition, a large hammerhead shark is prowling the area, and not surprisingly there is a confrontation between the shark, and a group of dolphins.The remake of Flipper has a generic kid friendly storyline, and the cast do a good job of delivering the kind of squeaky clean PG movie that was intended.  Elijah Wood isn't exactly the cutest kid, but he does ""troubled and misunderstood"" pretty well.  The film avoids getting overly emotional, as Sandy doesn't display deep feelings for his uncle or Kim.  Paul Hogan (Crocodile Dundee films) familiar in over the top roles, is more restrained here.  Jonathan Banks (Wiseguy) does what he can, but his bad guy role lacks real menace.  Chelsea Field does add a nice spark, but romance is not a priority here.Flipper is harmless family friendly entertainment that pays little homage to the original source material.  It appears to be an attempt to cash in on whatever scant cache was left among fans, and also appeal to parents with younger children.  There are a few cool scenes involving the dolphin, and the setting in the Bahamas is wonderful.  The acting is decent, but the movie is formulaic, and often seems to be going through the motions.",3,Flipper remake seems to be the usual marketing ploy...,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,3189,"['dolphin', 'Flipper', 'originally', 'appeared', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'released', '1963', 'television', 'series', 'called', 'Flipper', '1964-67', 'based', 'film', 'ran', 'three', 'seasons', 'Very', 'loosely', 'based', '1963', 'original', 'film', 'Flipper', '1996', 'be', 'attempt', 'appeal', 'who', 'might', 'fondly', 'remember', 'movie', 'TV', 'show', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'as', 'well', 'families', 'children', 'ten', 'below', 'Flipper', 'was', 'then', 'probably', 'still', 'now', 'first', 'name', 'mind', 'when', 'think', 'dolphins', 'understandable', 'why', 'studio', 'backed', 'project', 'even', 'movie', 'firmly', 'aimed', 'younger', 'audience', ""n't"", 'have', 'great', 'story', 'tell.Aside', 'utilizing', 'few', 'character', 'names', 'movie', 'total', 'reboot', 'Flipper', 'story', 'Porter', 'Ricks', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'fisherman', 'port', 'town', 'Coral', 'Key', 'who', 'taking', 'care', 'nephew', 'Sandy', 'Ricks', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'who', 'come', 'Chicago', 'stay', 'summer', 'out', 'sea', 'Ricks', 'observe', 'Dirk', 'Morgan', 'Jonathan', 'Banks', 'crazy', 'tour', 'operator', 'shooting', 'dolphin', 'rifle', 'little', 'help', 'Sandy', 'dolphin', 'escape.Sandy', ""n't"", 'loving', 'way', 'summer', 'looking', 'things', 'change', 'when', 'dolphin', 'up', 'be', 'friends', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Kim', 'Jessica', 'Wesson', 'dolphin', 'name', 'Flipper', 'Unfortunately', 'law', 'keeping', 'dolphin', 'pet', 'things', 'are', 'apparently', 'slow', 'around', 'Coral', 'Key', 'Sheriff', 'Buck', 'Cowan', 'Isaac', 'Hayes', 'forcibly', 'dolphin', 'out', 'sea.Flipper', 'manages', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'Rick', 'home', 'poor', 'animal', 'very', 'sick', 'Porter', 'girlfriend', 'Cathy', 'Chelsea', 'Field', 'treat', 'animal', 'soon', 'discover', 'Flipper', 'been', 'poisoned', 'Dirk', 'Morgan', 'suspected', 'dumping', 'toxic', 'wastes', 'sea', 'setting', 'stage', 'mildly', 'exciting', 'finish', 'mostly', 'numbers', 'adventure/comedy', ""n't"", 'too', 'violent', 'scary', 'younger', 'children', 'addition', 'large', 'hammerhead', 'shark', 'prowling', 'area', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'confrontation', 'shark', 'group', 'dolphins.The', 'remake', 'Flipper', 'generic', 'kid', 'friendly', 'storyline', 'cast', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'delivering', 'kind', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'PG', 'movie', 'was', 'intended', 'Elijah', 'Wood', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'cutest', 'kid', 'troubled', 'misunderstood', 'pretty', 'well', 'film', 'avoids', 'getting', 'overly', 'emotional', 'Sandy', ""n't"", 'display', 'deep', 'feelings', 'uncle', 'Kim', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'films', 'familiar', 'top', 'roles', 'more', 'restrained', 'here', 'Jonathan', 'Banks', 'Wiseguy', 'what', 'can', 'bad', 'guy', 'role', 'real', 'menace', 'Chelsea', 'Field', 'add', 'nice', 'spark', 'romance', 'not', 'priority', 'here.Flipper', 'harmless', 'family', 'friendly', 'entertainment', 'little', 'homage', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'be', 'attempt', 'cash', 'scant', 'cache', 'was', 'left', 'fans', 'also', 'appeal', 'parents', 'younger', 'children', 'are', 'few', 'cool', 'scenes', 'involving', 'dolphin', 'setting', 'Bahamas', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'decent', 'movie', 'formulaic', 'often', 'be', 'going', 'motions']",N/A
