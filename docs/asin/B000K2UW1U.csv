The quality of the picture is sub-par.  It is blurry.  Obviously no one bothered to clean it up and re-master it.  I have noticed that about the Cheezy Films DVD releases I have so far.  It is great that these B movies are being released to DVD, but the pleasure is marred by the lousy quality.",2,Atlas,1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,427,"['OK', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'sword-and-sandal', 'non-epic', 'Talky', 'color', 'film', 'fine', 'artwork', 'DVD', 'cover', 'great', 'quality', 'picture', 'sub-par', 'blurry', 'Obviously', 'one', 'bothered', 'clean', 'up', 're-master', 'have', 'noticed', 'Cheezy', 'Films', 'DVD', 'have', 'so', 'far', 'great', 'B', 'movies', 'are', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'pleasure', 'marred', 'lousy', 'quality']",N/A

However, I was very disappointed that the movie must have been filmed in wide screen but the dvd version was cropped to full screen, leaving, at many times, a large center space and the actors only shown partally or only one at a time.

1030504,AZX6YRJ2574F8,B000K2UW1U,Remus,"[7, 7]","This movie has a surprisingly literate and witty screenplay, with learned homages to ancient myth and history, and the acting by the three leads is quite strong (Forest as the Olympic wrestler-turned-warrior with a conscience, Morris as the wryly seductive leading lady, and especially Wolff as the scheming tyrant, who plays the role as if he were a charismatic young hoodlum in a 1960s biker movie, with fascinating results). Unfortunately, director Roger Corman was supposed to have 500 Greek soldiers for battle scenes, but only 50 showed up, so the epic ambitions of the movie were subverted by circumstances. Too bad! It's also unfortunate that the dvd crops the widescreen print down to full-screen. But the script and the performances remain, to be appreciated by any viewer with a love of the ancient world and a bit of imagination.",3,Surprisingly literate,1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,841,"['movie', 'surprisingly', 'literate', 'witty', 'screenplay', 'learned', 'homages', 'ancient', 'myth', 'history', 'acting', 'three', 'leads', 'quite', 'strong', 'Forest', 'Olympic', 'wrestler-turned-warrior', 'conscience', 'Morris', 'wryly', 'seductive', 'leading', 'lady', 'especially', 'Wolff', 'scheming', 'tyrant', 'who', 'role', 'were', 'charismatic', 'young', 'hoodlum', '1960s', 'biker', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'results', 'Unfortunately', 'director', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', '500', 'Greek', 'soldiers', 'battle', 'scenes', 'only', '50', 'showed', 'up', 'epic', 'ambitions', 'movie', 'were', 'subverted', 'circumstances', 'Too', 'bad', 'also', 'unfortunate', 'dvd', 'widescreen', 'print', 'down', 'full-screen', 'script', 'performances', 'remain', 'be', 'appreciated', 'viewer', 'love', 'ancient', 'world', 'bit', 'imagination']",N/A
