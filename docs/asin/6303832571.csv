386484,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,6303832571,D. Hartley,"[10, 10]","One of director Spike Lee's earlier, funny films (his debut, actually). A sexy, hip, and fiercely independent young woman (Tracy Camilla Johns) juggles relationships with three men (who are all quite aware of each other's existence). Lee steals his own movie by casting himself as the goofiest and most memorable of the three suitors- ""Mars"", a hilarious trash-talking Brooklyn version of the classic Woody Allen nebbish. Lee milks maximum laughs from the huffing and puffing by the competing paramours, as they each jockey for the alpha position (and makes keen observations about sexist machismo and male vanity along the way). Spike's dad Bill Lee composed a lovely jazz-pop score. Despite being a little rough around the edges (due to low budget constraints) it was still a groundbreaking film in the context of modern independent cinema, and an empowering milestone for an exciting new wave of talented African-American filmmakers who followed in its wake.",4,Please baby please baby please baby please!,1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,961,"['One', 'director', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'earlier', 'funny', 'films', 'debut', 'actually', 'sexy', 'hip', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'young', 'woman', 'Tracy', 'Camilla', 'Johns', 'relationships', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'quite', 'aware', 'other', 'existence', 'Lee', 'own', 'movie', 'casting', 'goofiest', 'most', 'memorable', 'three', 'suitors-', 'Mars', 'hilarious', 'trash-talking', 'Brooklyn', 'version', 'classic', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'nebbish', 'Lee', 'milks', 'maximum', 'laughs', 'huffing', 'puffing', 'competing', 'paramours', 'jockey', 'alpha', 'position', 'keen', 'observations', 'sexist', 'machismo', 'male', 'vanity', 'way', 'Spike', 'dad', 'Bill', 'Lee', 'composed', 'lovely', 'jazz-pop', 'score', 'being', 'little', 'rough', 'edges', 'due', 'low', 'budget', 'constraints', 'was', 'still', 'groundbreaking', 'film', 'context', 'modern', 'independent', 'cinema', 'empowering', 'milestone', 'exciting', 'new', 'wave', 'talented', 'African-American', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'followed', 'wake']",She's Gotta Have It VHS

386486,APVNDUMOTRJ78,6303832571,E. Drake,"[1, 1]","This will be my first review of a Spike Lee film, which happens to be Lee's first film. As I have begun for the Coen Brother's films, It is my goal (as I have the first five films sitting in a stack atop my DVD player) to review all of Lee's films chronologically as I watch them. Therefore, check periodically on my review page.  In regards to this review, believe it or not, this is only the second Spike Lee film I have ever watched, therefore I have little to say about how this film compares to his others.I'll start with the only problem I have with this film:In regards to the Coen Brother's directorial debut, ""Blood Simple"" (which I have reviewed as well), ""She's Gotta Have"" It is way more film schoolish.  I just have a slight bias against any film which gives the slightest impression that the film was for a Master's thesis or something of that nature. But Lee's choice of B&W; surely has a lot to do with this as does the nature of the script.And on to what I liked about the film:As for that script mentioned above, during the entire course of the film, the characters from the film are constantly communicating directly to you (the viewer), telling you their thoughts, concerns and annoyances.As film schoolish as this may be, it adds a wonderful dynamic to the film which calls for a more intimate viewer, where you have no choice but to get involved.This film is noted as a turning point in African-American film, away from the Blaxploitation era. Differing from this era, it is actually more real, more believable and Spike Lee is a brave soul for sharing these wonderful people with us. ""She's Gotta Have It"" brings us into the lives of what seem to be educated African-American living in and out of a very beautiful Brooklyn. I give one thumb up to Lee just for showing us the real Brooklyn and areas.All the things we are accustomed to seeing in African-American films or films that depict African Americans are simply not there. Their apartments are not run-down, they are not struggling with jobs, drugs or violence. All that we are really faced with is a group of four people who are fairly different from each other and are at different moments in their lives. The man who is ready for a real caring/trustworthy relationship, the man who is in need of a wife for reasons of social status, a ""I need a sometimes girlfriend"" man (Lee's hysterical character) and a woman who is playing the field.All in all, this movie is a wonderful character study of Nola Darling (played by Tracy Camilla Johns) who takes on what is most often reserved for men in movies (i.e. sleeping with many partners with little concern for morality.) Here is Lee's twist, and here is what makes this movie great. We see the many shades of a person expressed through her need for three men for three separate reasons: when she needs a laugh, when she needs a shoulder, when she needs a body. For his first film, Spike Lee does a terrific job in showing us how we all are a slightly different person to each person we know.",4,Interesting Twist- Skip to Second Paragraph for Review,1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,3019,"['will', 'be', 'first', 'review', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'film', 'be', 'Lee', 'first', 'film', 'have', 'begun', 'Coen', 'Brother', 'films', 'goal', 'have', 'first', 'five', 'films', 'sitting', 'stack', 'DVD', 'player', 'review', 'Lee', 'films', 'chronologically', 'watch', 'Therefore', 'check', 'periodically', 'review', 'page', 'regards', 'review', 'believe', 'not', 'only', 'second', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'therefore', 'have', 'little', 'say', 'how', 'film', 'others.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'regards', 'Coen', 'Brother', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'have', 'reviewed', 'well', 'Got', 'ta', 'Have', 'way', 'more', 'film', 'schoolish', 'just', 'have', 'slight', 'bias', 'film', 'slightest', 'impression', 'film', 'was', 'Master', 'thesis', 'something', 'nature', 'Lee', 'choice', 'B', 'W', 'surely', 'lot', 'do', 'nature', 'script.And', 'what', 'liked', 'film', 'script', 'mentioned', 'entire', 'course', 'film', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'constantly', 'communicating', 'directly', 'viewer', 'telling', 'thoughts', 'concerns', 'annoyances.As', 'film', 'schoolish', 'may', 'be', 'wonderful', 'dynamic', 'film', 'more', 'intimate', 'viewer', 'where', 'have', 'choice', 'get', 'involved.This', 'film', 'noted', 'turning', 'point', 'African-American', 'film', 'away', 'Blaxploitation', 'era', 'Differing', 'era', 'actually', 'more', 'real', 'more', 'believable', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'brave', 'soul', 'sharing', 'wonderful', 'people', 'Got', 'ta', 'Have', 'lives', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'educated', 'African-American', 'living', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Brooklyn', 'give', 'one', 'thumb', 'up', 'Lee', 'just', 'showing', 'real', 'Brooklyn', 'areas.All', 'things', 'are', 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'African-American', 'films', 'films', 'depict', 'African', 'Americans', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'there', 'apartments', 'are', 'not', 'run-down', 'are', 'not', 'struggling', 'jobs', 'drugs', 'violence', 'are', 'really', 'faced', 'group', 'four', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'fairly', 'different', 'other', 'are', 'different', 'moments', 'lives', 'man', 'who', 'ready', 'real', 'caring/trustworthy', 'relationship', 'man', 'who', 'need', 'wife', 'reasons', 'social', 'status', 'need', 'sometimes', 'girlfriend', 'man', 'Lee', 'hysterical', 'character', 'woman', 'who', 'playing', 'field.All', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'character', 'study', 'Nola', 'Darling', 'played', 'Tracy', 'Camilla', 'Johns', 'who', 'what', 'most', 'often', 'reserved', 'men', 'movies', 'i.e', 'sleeping', 'many', 'partners', 'little', 'concern', 'morality', 'Here', 'Lee', 'twist', 'here', 'what', 'movie', 'great', 'see', 'many', 'shades', 'person', 'expressed', 'need', 'three', 'men', 'three', 'separate', 'reasons', 'when', 'laugh', 'when', 'shoulder', 'when', 'body', 'first', 'film', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'terrific', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'are', 'slightly', 'different', 'person', 'person', 'know']",She's Gotta Have It VHS

This project introduced us to the incomparable Mars Blackman, Spike's oh so charming alter ego. ""She's Gotta Have It"" is a wonderful treatise on the art of love and war from interesting perspectives.  On top of that, it is quite hilarious.It is a refreshing look at a black woman who insists on taking control of her sexuality rather than allowing it to be defined by men.  There are general male observations, general female observations, and specific cultural outlooks on the art of love and war from an African-American perspective.Tracy Camilla Johns, beautifully portraying the wonderfully developed character, Nola Darling, is perfectly cast as the independent black woman who, in her quest to be sexually independent, realizes this is an uphill journey when dealing with men who still have traditional ideas about women and their roles.  She was actively dating more than one man simply because she had adapted the attitude that no one man can provide everything she wanted/needed and furthermore, it was terribly unfair to label her promiscuous for doing so.  Interestingly enough, Nola also found that her own reactions when coming up against the same attitude in men, were amazingly traditional.This was a very well-written statement on the ups and downs of love.  It also introduces us to Law & Order's Divine Epatha Merkerson in a short but pivotal role as a sex therapist.Eeeeeeeeeeeeeexcellent movie!!!",5,On DVD At Long Last!!!! - Loooooooong Overdue!!!!,1197504000,"12 13, 2007",2007,1504,"['When', 'reviewing', 'Spike', 'work', 'down', 'probably', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'project', 'introduced', 'incomparable', 'Mars', 'Blackman', 'Spike', 'oh', 'so', 'charming', 'alter', 'ego', 'Got', 'ta', 'Have', 'wonderful', 'treatise', 'art', 'love', 'war', 'interesting', 'perspectives', 'top', 'quite', 'hilarious.It', 'refreshing', 'look', 'black', 'woman', 'who', 'taking', 'control', 'sexuality', 'rather', 'allowing', 'be', 'defined', 'men', 'are', 'general', 'male', 'observations', 'general', 'female', 'observations', 'specific', 'cultural', 'outlooks', 'art', 'love', 'war', 'African-American', 'perspective.Tracy', 'Camilla', 'Johns', 'beautifully', 'portraying', 'wonderfully', 'developed', 'character', 'Nola', 'Darling', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'independent', 'black', 'woman', 'who', 'quest', 'be', 'sexually', 'independent', 'realizes', 'uphill', 'journey', 'when', 'dealing', 'men', 'who', 'still', 'have', 'traditional', 'ideas', 'women', 'roles', 'was', 'actively', 'dating', 'more', 'one', 'man', 'simply', 'had', 'adapted', 'attitude', 'one', 'man', 'can', 'provide', 'everything', 'wanted/needed', 'furthermore', 'was', 'terribly', 'unfair', 'label', 'promiscuous', 'doing', 'so', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'Nola', 'also', 'found', 'own', 'reactions', 'when', 'coming', 'up', 'same', 'attitude', 'men', 'were', 'amazingly', 'traditional.This', 'was', 'very', 'well-written', 'statement', 'ups', 'downs', 'love', 'also', 'Law', 'Order', 'Divine', 'Epatha', 'Merkerson', 'short', 'pivotal', 'role', 'sex', 'therapist.Eeeeeeeeeeeeeexcellent', 'movie']",She's Gotta Have It VHS

386504,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,6303832571,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[13, 14]","It's been WAYYYY too long, but finally Spike Lee's debut, ""She's Gotta Have It"" has made it to DVD! It has always astounded me that Spike's other films have made it to DVD long before this one, but in January 2008, those of us who are fans of his work will get our wish. The ripple effect of this movie in the twenty-plus years since its release has been an abundance of films made for and by black folks - some of them good, some bad - but the main thing is that ""She's Gotta Have It"" proved that movies starring black actors do indeed have an audience and inspired many others to step out and attempt to make the same impact.In case you may be one of the few who are unaware of the plot behind this deliciously brash and sexy comedy, it focuses on the lead character Nola Darling (Tracy Camilla Johns), a young Brooklyn print artist that has not one, but three lovers, all who feel that they are the right man for her. Nola makes no apologies for the type of woman she is...a virile, independent being who enjoys sex and enjoys giving it to whomever she is dealing with. She makes it known what it is she wants from a man, and the three that she juggles here are all sprung by her charms. She is the inattainable prize of these men who each want to have her to themselves. Of course, as the film progresses, they each are pushing her to make a choice between them, and she is unable to - and wondering just why she has to.Nola's men are as different as day is from night: Jamie (Tommy Hicks), who is sweet, sensitive but possessive; Greer (John Canada Terrell), a narcissistic pretty-boy model who believes the world revolves around him  and the loony offbeat homeboy on a bike, Mars (Spike Lee himself). The three guys represent qualities that Nola would probably like to find in one man, but since she hasn't, she deals with three.Filmed on location in Spike's beloved Brooklyn on a bare-bones budget in 1986 in mostly black and white, this independent gem looks very much like a documentary at times, with characters talking to the camera. It was a very effective method and almost makes you feel like you are looking through a window at this young woman's love life. Some people have been critical of this movie, saying it portrays black women as promiscuous. But truthfully speaking, men have exhibited the same kind of ""loose"" behavior for centuries and they get pats on the back and told that they are ""THE MAN"". In sharp contrast, women get bashed if they live their lives the way Nola does in this film - a true double standard. She brings this up in the movie, and although you may not totally agree with her logic, you have to admit that she is on point.The only real ""negative"" message I can see in ""She's Gotta Have It"" is the fact that this woman has three lovers in the age of AIDS, but aside from that, I have to commend Spike for continuing to make films that show various sides of black life, in either a humorous or serious light (or sometimes both at once) that were not normally shown to the mainstream. His work is essential, inspirational and of great historical value in African-American culture - hell, in AMERICAN culture, period!  Add this movie to your Spike collection if you haven't done so already!Update: Slightly disappointing about the DVD packaging is that there are no extras - no director's commentary, interviews with the cast or outtakes/deleted scenes (although the budget may not allowed for too many of those). These are things I would have liked to see included on the DVD, but I'll take this just the way it is! :)",5,"Finally, the first Spike Lee joint on DVD!",1197417600,"12 12, 2007",2007,3560,"['been', 'WAYYYY', 'too', 'long', 'finally', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'debut', 'Got', 'ta', 'Have', 'made', 'DVD', 'always', 'astounded', 'Spike', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'made', 'DVD', 'long', 'before', 'one', 'January', '2008', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'work', 'will', 'get', 'wish', 'ripple', 'effect', 'movie', 'twenty-plus', 'years', 'release', 'been', 'abundance', 'films', 'made', 'black', 'folks', 'good', 'bad', 'main', 'thing', 'Got', 'ta', 'Have', 'proved', 'movies', 'starring', 'black', 'actors', 'do', 'indeed', 'have', 'audience', 'inspired', 'many', 'others', 'step', 'out', 'attempt', 'make', 'same', 'impact.In', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'are', 'unaware', 'plot', 'deliciously', 'brash', 'sexy', 'comedy', 'lead', 'character', 'Nola', 'Darling', 'Tracy', 'Camilla', 'Johns', 'young', 'Brooklyn', 'print', 'artist', 'not', 'one', 'three', 'lovers', 'who', 'feel', 'are', 'right', 'man', 'Nola', 'apologies', 'type', 'woman', 'virile', 'independent', 'being', 'who', 'sex', 'giving', 'whomever', 'dealing', 'known', 'what', 'man', 'three', 'here', 'are', 'sprung', 'charms', 'inattainable', 'prize', 'men', 'who', 'want', 'have', 'course', 'film', 'are', 'pushing', 'make', 'choice', 'unable', 'wondering', 'just', 'why', 'to.Nola', 'men', 'are', 'as', 'different', 'day', 'night', 'Jamie', 'Tommy', 'Hicks', 'who', 'sweet', 'sensitive', 'possessive', 'Greer', 'John', 'Canada', 'Terrell', 'narcissistic', 'pretty-boy', 'model', 'who', 'world', 'loony', 'offbeat', 'homeboy', 'bike', 'Mars', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'three', 'guys', 'represent', 'qualities', 'Nola', 'would', 'probably', 'find', 'one', 'man', ""n't"", 'three.Filmed', 'location', 'Spike', 'beloved', 'Brooklyn', 'bare-bones', 'budget', '1986', 'mostly', 'black', 'white', 'independent', 'gem', 'very', 'much', 'documentary', 'times', 'characters', 'talking', 'camera', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'method', 'almost', 'feel', 'are', 'looking', 'window', 'young', 'woman', 'love', 'life', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'critical', 'movie', 'saying', 'black', 'women', 'promiscuous', 'truthfully', 'speaking', 'men', 'have', 'exhibited', 'same', 'kind', 'loose', 'behavior', 'centuries', 'get', 'pats', 'back', 'told', 'are', 'MAN', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'women', 'get', 'bashed', 'live', 'lives', 'way', 'Nola', 'film', 'true', 'double', 'standard', 'up', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'totally', 'agree', 'logic', 'have', 'admit', 'point.The', 'only', 'real', 'negative', 'message', 'can', 'see', 'Got', 'ta', 'Have', 'fact', 'woman', 'three', 'lovers', 'age', 'AIDS', 'aside', 'have', 'commend', 'Spike', 'continuing', 'make', 'films', 'show', 'various', 'sides', 'black', 'life', 'humorous', 'serious', 'light', 'sometimes', 'once', 'were', 'not', 'normally', 'shown', 'mainstream', 'work', 'essential', 'inspirational', 'great', 'historical', 'value', 'African-American', 'culture', 'hell', 'AMERICAN', 'culture', 'period', 'Add', 'movie', 'Spike', 'collection', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'so', 'already', 'Update', 'Slightly', 'disappointing', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'are', 'extras', 'director', 'commentary', 'interviews', 'cast', 'outtakes/deleted', 'scenes', 'budget', 'may', 'not', 'allowed', 'too', 'many', 'are', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'included', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'take', 'just', 'way']",She's Gotta Have It VHS
