It's not a smooth line. But both stories are fascinating, and the History Channel does a great job of presenting both.[Pause while I look up something that was not mentioned, and see if I can figure out why.]OK, now I can explain why Cro Magnon was not mentioned. The term is essentially obsolete among anthropologists, since they simply say ""early modern man."" Fine; I'll go with that. This movie agrees with several things I have read or seen, that Neanderthals are NOT our ancestors. They were a branch of the tree that also evolved from Australopithecus, moved into Europe while those remaining in Africa evolved into modern man. Then when modern man migrated into Europe, the well-established Neanderthal could not compete, and died out.The most recent fossil humans were thus Homo erectus, Java man, about 800,000 years ago. Neanderthal had already been discovered, but it seemed to imply that the most defining characteristic of our development was larger and larger brains. And of course the Piltdown Man hoax of 1912 didn't help matters any.Without going into the details, which I would only screw up anyway, let's just say that there are four basic approaches here. One is seeing the scientists in reenactments as they make their discoveries. Another is watching the hominids themselves (also reenactments, of course, but with great makeup and authentic details) as they go about those elements of their lives that go into making humans what we are: Lucy walking erect, Homo Habilis using stone tools, and finally early modern man using language and social organization to defeat the Neanderthals. Then we have modern scientists discussing the development of modern concepts of our family tree as the evidence came to light. Finally, it is all put together in the form of some pretty revealing maps and other graphics.Somehow they manage to put in a good bit of detail and still keep it comprehensible. That's why I gave it five stars",5,"Bravo, History Channel!",1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,2066,"[""'re"", 'following', 'two', 'time', 'lines', 'here', 'actual', 'ancestral', 'history', 'history', 'discoveries', 'revealing', 'history', 'not', 'smooth', 'line', 'stories', 'are', 'fascinating', 'History', 'Channel', 'great', 'job', 'presenting', '[', 'Pause', 'look', 'up', 'something', 'was', 'not', 'mentioned', 'see', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'why', ']', 'OK', 'now', 'can', 'explain', 'why', 'Cro', 'Magnon', 'was', 'not', 'mentioned', 'term', 'essentially', 'obsolete', 'anthropologists', 'simply', 'say', 'early', 'modern', 'man', 'Fine', ""'ll"", 'go', 'movie', 'several', 'things', 'have', 'read', 'seen', 'Neanderthals', 'are', 'NOT', 'ancestors', 'were', 'branch', 'tree', 'also', 'evolved', 'Australopithecus', 'moved', 'Europe', 'remaining', 'Africa', 'evolved', 'modern', 'man', 'Then', 'when', 'modern', 'man', 'migrated', 'Europe', 'well-established', 'Neanderthal', 'could', 'not', 'compete', 'died', 'most', 'recent', 'fossil', 'humans', 'were', 'thus', 'Homo', 'erectus', 'Java', 'man', '800,000', 'years', 'ago', 'Neanderthal', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'discovered', 'seemed', 'imply', 'most', 'defining', 'characteristic', 'development', 'was', 'larger', 'larger', 'brains', 'course', 'Piltdown', 'Man', 'hoax', '1912', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'any.Without', 'going', 'details', 'would', 'only', 'screw', 'up', 'anyway', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'are', 'four', 'basic', 'approaches', 'here', 'One', 'seeing', 'scientists', 'reenactments', 'make', 'discoveries', 'watching', 'hominids', 'also', 'course', 'great', 'makeup', 'authentic', 'details', 'go', 'elements', 'lives', 'go', 'making', 'humans', 'what', 'are', 'Lucy', 'walking', 'erect', 'Homo', 'Habilis', 'using', 'stone', 'tools', 'finally', 'early', 'modern', 'man', 'using', 'language', 'social', 'organization', 'defeat', 'Neanderthals', 'Then', 'have', 'modern', 'scientists', 'discussing', 'development', 'modern', 'concepts', 'family', 'tree', 'evidence', 'came', 'light', 'Finally', 'put', 'together', 'form', 'pretty', 'revealing', 'maps', 'other', 'graphics.Somehow', 'manage', 'put', 'good', 'bit', 'detail', 'still', 'keep', 'comprehensible', 'why', 'gave', 'five', 'stars']",Ape to Man
944103,A90HPVBN7LU1F,B000BKVLA2,Book Hound,"[1, 28]","Other than laying out in a clear and concise manner the names of both the anthropologists and their fossil finds, this DVD falls way short of being a conclusive presentation of the evidence supporting the theory of evolution. Instead it raises more issues than it answers and leaves one with a disturbing feeling of where the scientific community is trying to take us.  Each major archeological find leads to massive speculation of the importance of each fossil, and in the end, nothing seems at all conclusive from a history standpoint for the student. To present such evidence to show the conclusive nature of evolution is simply intellectually dishonest, as the historic record is just too subjective with each find tainted with the selfish motivations of the finding anthropologist. After viewing this DVD, the title's initial premise of where we came from is still open and subject to a wide debate.",1,A intellectually dishonest academic endeavor,1279497600,"07 19, 2010",2010,904,"['Other', 'laying', 'out', 'clear', 'concise', 'manner', 'names', 'anthropologists', 'fossil', 'finds', 'DVD', 'way', 'short', 'being', 'conclusive', 'presentation', 'evidence', 'supporting', 'theory', 'evolution', 'Instead', 'more', 'issues', 'one', 'disturbing', 'feeling', 'where', 'scientific', 'community', 'trying', 'take', 'major', 'archeological', 'find', 'massive', 'speculation', 'importance', 'fossil', 'end', 'nothing', 'conclusive', 'history', 'standpoint', 'student', 'present', 'such', 'evidence', 'show', 'conclusive', 'nature', 'evolution', 'simply', 'intellectually', 'dishonest', 'historic', 'record', 'just', 'too', 'subjective', 'find', 'tainted', 'selfish', 'motivations', 'finding', 'anthropologist', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'title', 'initial', 'premise', 'where', 'came', 'still', 'open', 'subject', 'wide', 'debate']",Ape to Man

While they do a good job of chronicling the discoveries and the scientists involved in the search for our past the theories and answers they sometimes come up with are based less on science and more on the need to gain viewers.For example, showing the Neanderthals being wiped our by early modern man, saying that Neanderthals didn't have art, those are statements designed to shock but have little in the way of fact behind them.  The fossil record shows both groups living side by side in Europe for thousands of years.  If we took thousands of years to kill a group that we outnumbered, outsmarted and outarmed than early modern men were twits.  Tigers would have taken over by now.Also the Neanderthals DID have art.  Now, maybe they were copying us, but copy cats or not, they had a creative enough mind to make art.  Trying to picture them as backwards and less developed than us is only useful to those who want to believe they were so.  Once again, to support the idea that we wiped them out.We are not natural born killers - blaming our genes for actions we did, or did not do, is just a way to get out of the guilt of such things as wars and genocide.  Yes, they happen.  No, you can't blame our DNA.  We were hunted well before we became hunters.  Modern problems are caused by greed, bad planning and self-centered minds - not by some actions by the first humans that may, or may not, have happened.The questions are interesting but the answers are nothing but the same old ones people have been parroting for decades.If this has been made in the 70s it would have been ahead of it's times.
