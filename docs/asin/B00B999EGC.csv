It still had a very good plot and scary atmosphere.  I commend the actors, directors, and the whole film crew, on a job well done.

1623412,A19FZGML2QVUTL,B00B999EGC,Josh Hunt,"[3, 3]","Being that ""President's Day"" is a micro budget film, with an estimated budget of only $5,000, it was a film that I actually liked.A true throwback to real horror, this film has all the great elements that make up a low-budget, gory, cheesy horror flick.With the budget the filmmakers had, I was surprised at how great basically all of the effects were in the movie, mainly because a lot of movies with way bigger budgets attempt to do, but fail badly.Some of the things that I didn't care for was the acting, but that's just me. It seemed that only a couple of the actors in this film could actually act. A lot of it comes out as some of the crappiest acting I've ever seen, but that's just me. There were a few parts where the dialogue as well as the acting was just really cheesy to me. The kind that makes you wonder if it was intended to be that way, or if they writers/actors really thought it was going to be golden.So overall I really enjoyed this film, apart from the acting. It has all the elements that belong in a cheesy, low-budget horror film, and everything was put together nicely.",4,Casting my student vote,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,1096,"['Being', 'President', 'Day', 'micro', 'budget', 'film', 'estimated', 'budget', 'only', '5,000', 'was', 'film', 'actually', 'liked.A', 'true', 'throwback', 'real', 'horror', 'film', 'great', 'elements', 'make', 'up', 'low-budget', 'gory', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'flick.With', 'budget', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'great', 'basically', 'effects', 'were', 'movie', 'mainly', 'lot', 'movies', 'way', 'bigger', 'budgets', 'attempt', 'do', 'fail', 'badly.Some', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'acting', 'just', 'seemed', 'only', 'couple', 'actors', 'film', 'could', 'actually', 'act', 'lot', 'out', 'crappiest', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'just', 'were', 'few', 'parts', 'where', 'dialogue', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'really', 'cheesy', 'kind', 'wonder', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'way', 'writers/actors', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'golden.So', 'overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'apart', 'acting', 'elements', 'belong', 'cheesy', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'film', 'everything', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'nicely']",President's Day

I recall hearing about this 3 years ago and wondered why it had not surfaced. I'm glad it finally did and it was worth the wait.
