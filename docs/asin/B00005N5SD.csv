As Paul Hogan tries to resurrect a dead franchise that really wasn't all that clever or popular in the first place.  Don't get me wrong, I love Paul Hogan, The first Croc was good, he was ok in Almost an angel, he was a straight pimp in Lightning Jack; one of the best comedies of all time.

Paul's previous films to this name are much more inspired in plot, montage, and acting.  In this film, Hogan seems to be along for the ride, and for this I blame the direction and screenwriting which is listless and dull.  Mind you, CD in LA is not a bad film by any means, nor is it memorable.  But there is a sense that Hollywood is merely attempting to cash in on the Dundee character and not use Hogan as the charming, affible actor that he is.Alas, poor Paul Hogan, I knew him well, and miss him in this film.  Was it to pay for Linda Kozlowski's plastic surgery, or has Paul Hogan truly lost his bearings in a foreign land?

666661,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00005N5SD,Charles Ashbacher,"[1, 2]","This movie is an existence proof that the same approach to comedy can be done once too often. In this third movie in the Crocodile Dundee genre, Mick Dundee is transplanted to Los Angeles, where he is once again trying to play the hick in the big city. However, that premise fails, the jokes are predictable and when they are not, they come across as dumb. The scene where Mick and his friend are ordering food at Wendy's is too long and very boring. There is another scene where some Hollywood people find out that Mick is from Australia and then ask him if he knows Mel Gibson. Mick replies that he does and it turns out that he is talking about another Mel Gibson that lives near Walkabout Creek. Given that the movie star Mel Gibson would be well known all throughout Australia, even Mick Dundee would know who he is.Interwoven with all the scenes of hickdom gone astray, Mick's companion Sue is a journalist on the track of crooked studio executives. The villains in this case are not very strong, so they do not provide enough support to overcome the weakness of Mick's role as the continuing dummy. The high points of the movie are the cameos by other celebrities. My favorite was the one by Mike Tyson, where he plays some form of mystic peacenik. The funniest point in the movie was when Mick has his son walk away and then asks the Tyson character to help him up because his legs have locked in the crossed position.This movie is largely forgettable, although Paul Hogan plays the character of Mick Dundee very well; this third time is a dud rather than a charm. Without some other strong supporting theme, such as the evil drug dealers in the second movie, the plot of Mick as transplanted hick is not enough to make an interesting movie.",3,Mick as transplanted hick is used once too often and there is no strong villain to compensate,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,1749,"['movie', 'existence', 'proof', 'same', 'approach', 'comedy', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'once', 'too', 'often', 'third', 'movie', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'genre', 'Mick', 'Dundee', 'transplanted', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'where', 'once', 'again', 'trying', 'play', 'hick', 'big', 'city', 'However', 'premise', 'fails', 'jokes', 'are', 'predictable', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'come', 'dumb', 'scene', 'where', 'Mick', 'friend', 'are', 'ordering', 'food', 'Wendy', 'too', 'long', 'very', 'boring', 'scene', 'where', 'Hollywood', 'people', 'find', 'out', 'Mick', 'Australia', 'then', 'ask', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Mick', 'out', 'talking', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Creek', 'Given', 'movie', 'star', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'known', 'Australia', 'even', 'Mick', 'Dundee', 'would', 'know', 'who', 'is.Interwoven', 'scenes', 'hickdom', 'gone', 'astray', 'Mick', 'companion', 'Sue', 'journalist', 'track', 'crooked', 'studio', 'executives', 'villains', 'case', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'strong', 'do', 'not', 'provide', 'enough', 'support', 'overcome', 'weakness', 'Mick', 'role', 'continuing', 'dummy', 'high', 'points', 'movie', 'are', 'cameos', 'other', 'celebrities', 'favorite', 'was', 'one', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'where', 'form', 'mystic', 'peacenik', 'funniest', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'Mick', 'son', 'walk', 'away', 'then', 'Tyson', 'character', 'help', 'up', 'legs', 'have', 'locked', 'crossed', 'position.This', 'movie', 'largely', 'forgettable', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'character', 'Mick', 'Dundee', 'very', 'well', 'third', 'time', 'dud', 'rather', 'charm', 'other', 'strong', 'supporting', 'theme', 'such', 'evil', 'drug', 'dealers', 'second', 'movie', 'plot', 'Mick', 'transplanted', 'hick', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'interesting', 'movie']",N/A

When we last saw Mick and Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski), they had fled back to the Australian outback, where they succeeded in ending the threat of a Colombian drug trafficker, and Sue, when asked if she was ready to go home, said, ""I *am* home.""  And, apparently, there they stayed, for when we join them in this installment of the franchise, they've made themselves a home near Walkabout Creek and have a nine-year-old son (Serge Cockburn), known as Mikey Charlton because his parents aren't legally married.  When Sue's newspaper-magnate father calls to tell her that the editor of his LA paper has just been killed and he wants her to take over till he can find a replacement, she's reluctant to leave her family, but Mick sensibly points out that there's no reason they can't go too; Mikey, he says, is his grandfather's heir, and someday ""he'll have to choose"" whether he wants to be a newspaperman or an apprentice croc-hunter.  How's he supposed to decide if he doesn't experience *both* lifestyles?  So off to LA they go.  Mick remains the innocent country boy in the big city, but his bush skills prove invaluable when evidence begins to suggest that the defunct editor met his end through human agency and was trying to expose something hinky connected to a small-time film studio run by Arnan Rothman (Jere Burns).  With the help of his buddy Jacko (Alec Wilson), Mick discovers the truth and brings the bad guys to book.

666664,A3N95R1VKWROWF,B00005N5SD,Christopher Schwinger,"[0, 0]","I don't know why this movie was less well received than the earlier two.  I think it's a lot funnier than the earlier two and has enormous appeal for putting together two basic kinds of comedy:  satire of the crazy culture of Los Angeles (and sometimes America as a whole, which of course gets influenced by L.A.), and Mick Dundee's always-funny way of dealing with new situations.  It's hard to describe how funny something is, just like it's hard to describe how good something tastes or how beautiful something looks.  So you'll just have to see it for yourself!  I have seen it over and over and never get tired of it.  It's only rated PG, by the way.  One thing that makes this such a great comedy is that it doesn't have the feel of trying to be unnaturally funny.  It's filled with little incidents in Mick's life in Los Angeles, as he and Sue and their son temporarily live there, with the movie's plot ultimately being a caper he helps solve.  There are some movies where the humor doesn't seem that funny to me, which is kind of embarrassing, but in this, every single joke got a laugh out of me!  (There's even an inside joke which, now living in the area, I understand, where the news broadcaster calls almost 1/4 of an inch of rain a ""downpour"", because rainfall is infrequent.)  My favorite gag is when Mick thinks the lady on the intercom at the drive-through at Wendy's is actually named ""Wendy"".  If there'd be anywhere in America Mick would fit in, it's eclectic Los Angeles, and yet he still manages to stick out like a sore thumb everywhere.  I also like the crazy reactions people have to Mick's personality, and the music, by now-deceased Basil Poledouris.  Plus, the comedy is never sleazy or degrading.  He meets some weirdos, but the humor revolves around his reactions, not them.  That's something hard to find in movies of the last several decades.I have seen quite a lot of movies, and I would put this among my top favorite movies (which are all comedies) with the Disney movies Blackbeard's Ghost, Snowball Express, The Strongest Man in the World, and The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again; What's Up, Doc?; Jean Arthur's The Devil and Miss Jones; Danny Kaye's The Court Jester; and Dick Van Dyke's Never a Dull Moment.",5,I think it's a lot funnier than #'s 1 and 2 - I'd even put it as one of my top 10 favorite movies,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,2247,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'less', 'well', 'received', 'earlier', 'two', 'think', 'lot', 'funnier', 'earlier', 'two', 'enormous', 'appeal', 'putting', 'together', 'two', 'basic', 'kinds', 'comedy', 'satire', 'crazy', 'culture', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'sometimes', 'America', 'whole', 'course', 'influenced', 'L.A.', 'Mick', 'Dundee', 'always-funny', 'way', 'dealing', 'new', 'situations', 'hard', 'describe', 'how', 'funny', 'something', 'just', 'hard', 'describe', 'how', 'good', 'something', 'tastes', 'how', 'beautiful', 'something', 'looks', 'So', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'have', 'seen', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'only', 'rated', 'PG', 'way', 'One', 'thing', 'such', 'great', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'have', 'feel', 'trying', 'be', 'unnaturally', 'funny', 'filled', 'little', 'incidents', 'Mick', 'life', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Sue', 'son', 'temporarily', 'live', 'there', 'movie', 'plot', 'ultimately', 'being', 'caper', 'solve', 'are', 'movies', 'where', 'humor', ""n't"", 'seem', 'funny', 'kind', 'embarrassing', 'single', 'joke', 'got', 'laugh', 'even', 'inside', 'joke', 'now', 'living', 'area', 'understand', 'where', 'news', 'broadcaster', 'almost', '1/4', 'inch', 'rain', 'downpour', 'rainfall', 'infrequent', 'favorite', 'gag', 'when', 'Mick', 'lady', 'intercom', 'drive-through', 'Wendy', 'actually', 'named', 'Wendy', ""'d"", 'be', 'anywhere', 'America', 'Mick', 'would', 'fit', 'eclectic', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'yet', 'still', 'stick', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'everywhere', 'also', 'crazy', 'reactions', 'people', 'have', 'Mick', 'personality', 'music', 'now-deceased', 'Basil', 'Poledouris', 'comedy', 'never', 'sleazy', 'degrading', 'weirdos', 'humor', 'reactions', 'not', 'something', 'hard', 'find', 'movies', 'last', 'several', 'decades.I', 'have', 'seen', 'quite', 'lot', 'movies', 'would', 'put', 'top', 'favorite', 'movies', 'are', 'comedies', 'Disney', 'movies', 'Blackbeard', 'Ghost', 'Snowball', 'Express', 'Strongest', 'Man', 'World', 'Apple', 'Dumpling', 'Gang', 'Rides', 'Again', 'What', 'Up', 'Doc', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'Devil', 'Miss', 'Jones', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'Court', 'Jester', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Never', 'Dull', 'Moment']",N/A

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","My family's favorite film for certain times of the year is CROCODILE DUNDEE (1986) - a beauty and classic Australian/Paul Hogan action and humor. The sequel CROCODILE DUNDEE II (1988) is a tad disappointing but we like it too.CROCODILE DUNDEE IN L.A. (a/k/a/ CROCODILE DUNDEE IN LOS ANGELES, 2001) is a perfect example of why super-late sequels should never, ever be made. I was struggling to think of what to call this ... an ""astroquel"" (astronomic time separation)? Or as is the case with THE LOST BOYS, is it a ""no-quel""? Or is it a ""geriquel"", where we get to see everyone looking 15 years older?In brief, this gentle hour and a half of basically nothing gives us one pleasure: it introduces the charming young Serge Cockburn as Michael Dundee, Jr., a sweet and rather stunning performance. Obviously set in 2001, 13 years after the sequel, we find Crocodile Dundee and his gal, the intrepid Sue Charleton (Linda Kozlowski, husky and boring as ever) living in Walkabout Creek. Business takes them back to L.A., and blah blah blah.Both Kozlowski and Hogan are clearly tired and not very happy to be in this film. Hogan manages laugh-out-loud moments in anything he does, which is true here, but that's about it. You know you have a stinkbomb when your best special walk-on appearance is a fat Paul Rodriguez, whining about the vicious nature of show business.If you are a diehard of Hogan's you may as well get this little-mentioned film. I had NO idea he had made a third CROCODILE DUNDEE and was somewhat glad to see it ... ONCE. Right after this he did the remarkably funny political comedy STRANGE BEDFELLOWS with Michael Caton (see my review) - so clearly Hogan wasn't all that tired. On the other hand, his pal Donk (Steve Rackman) is showing his age, poor fellow.Sorely, sorely missed is the great John Meillon as goofy old Walt, Dundee's best mate and sometime business partner.Looks like Hogan was just tired of the idea of CROCODILE coming back to bite him in the rump.",3,I was famous in the 1980s ya pelican!!,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,1983,"['family', 'favorite', 'film', 'certain', 'times', 'year', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', '1986', 'beauty', 'classic', 'Australian/Paul', 'Hogan', 'action', 'humor', 'sequel', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'II', '1988', 'tad', 'disappointing', 'like', 'too.CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'IN', 'L.A.', 'a/k/a/', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'IN', 'LOS', 'ANGELES', '2001', 'perfect', 'example', 'why', 'super-late', 'sequels', 'should', 'never', 'ever', 'be', 'made', 'was', 'struggling', 'think', 'what', 'call', 'astroquel', 'astronomic', 'time', 'separation', 'case', 'LOST', 'BOYS', 'no-quel', 'geriquel', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'everyone', 'looking', '15', 'years', 'older', 'brief', 'gentle', 'hour', 'half', 'basically', 'nothing', 'one', 'pleasure', 'charming', 'young', 'Serge', 'Cockburn', 'Michael', 'Dundee', 'Jr.', 'sweet', 'rather', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Obviously', 'set', '2001', '13', 'years', 'sequel', 'find', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'gal', 'intrepid', 'Sue', 'Charleton', 'Linda', 'Kozlowski', 'husky', 'boring', 'ever', 'living', 'Walkabout', 'Creek', 'Business', 'back', 'L.A.', 'blah', 'blah', 'Kozlowski', 'Hogan', 'are', 'clearly', 'tired', 'not', 'very', 'happy', 'be', 'film', 'Hogan', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'anything', 'true', 'here', 'know', 'have', 'stinkbomb', 'when', 'best', 'special', 'walk-on', 'appearance', 'fat', 'Paul', 'Rodriguez', 'whining', 'vicious', 'nature', 'show', 'are', 'diehard', 'Hogan', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'little-mentioned', 'film', 'had', 'NO', 'idea', 'had', 'made', 'third', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'was', 'somewhat', 'glad', 'see', 'ONCE', 'Right', 'did', 'remarkably', 'funny', 'political', 'comedy', 'STRANGE', 'BEDFELLOWS', 'Michael', 'Caton', 'see', 'review', 'so', 'clearly', 'Hogan', 'was', ""n't"", 'tired', 'other', 'hand', 'pal', 'Donk', 'Steve', 'Rackman', 'showing', 'age', 'poor', 'fellow.Sorely', 'sorely', 'missed', 'great', 'John', 'Meillon', 'goofy', 'old', 'Walt', 'Dundee', 'best', 'mate', 'sometime', 'business', 'partner.Looks', 'Hogan', 'was', 'just', 'tired', 'idea', 'CROCODILE', 'coming', 'back', 'bite', 'rump']",N/A

666679,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,B00005N5SD,Godly Gadfly,"[1, 4]","The return of Crocodile Dundee for a third movie was greeted with a great deal of applause: hooray for a good old fashioned family friendly comedy.  But is it?Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles features the return of Paul Hogan as Crocodile Dundee, once again starring in his humorous fish-out-of-the-water role.  This time Dundee travels with his common-law-wife and son to Los Angeles, where he helps her uncover a smuggling ring.  The action sequences and climax at the end all have their humour, but the real fun occurs throughout the movie, with Dundee the nave Australian in the big American city.  Most of the humour revolves around cultural differences and pokes fun at American culture and America's own holy grails: the fast food industry, the movie business.  Some of the highlights that come to mind are a scene where Dundee chokes up the expressway while trying to rescue a skunk, the drive-through at Wendys, and the drive-by mugging which backfired.  Added to the cultural jokes are slap stick humor typical of a comedy where the villains are treated to a variety of appropriate punishments.  And the scenes of Australia (with a local aborigine using a mobile phone) are equally charming.  All family friendly so far, although the amount of violence and the tense chase scene involving gun-toting thugs and hungry lions at the end would be frightening for youngsters.Somewhat more disturbing, however, are the oblique and more incidental aspects of the movie.  There are several foul mouthed expressions, and around half a dozen instances of blasphemy.  Is this really necessary?  Apparently so.  But that's not the worst of it.  The movie is filled with sexual innuendoes, with numerous ogling of rear ends and comments like ""nice butt"", and scantily clad babes are abundant - there's a hardly a modestly dressed female to be seen.  The abundant cleavage and short skirts and provocative comments does little to discourage lustful thoughts.  And Mick & Sue's eventual marriage merely serves to make their earlier common-law relationship ""official.""  But to top it off, there are several jokes about homosexuality, including a scene where Dundee and his companion enter a gay cross-dressing bar.  Producers, it seems, are determined to include references to homosexuality, in order to make us desensitized to an immoral lifestyle.  They are already succeeding, as evidenced in the fact that many speak of this movie as ""family friendly all the way.""  Be warned that it's not ""all the way"" family friendly, because although this is a PG movie, by introducing your children to Crocodile Dundee you are introducing them to profanity and immorality in abundance. Even the fact that Dundee takes the law into his own hands by breaking and entering in order nab the villains does little to encourage respect for authority.  Mick Dundee may a better hero than most of Hollywood's offerings, but even he lacks some of the old fashioned morals that America once had.The standards are indeed slipping.  By society's standards, it is a relatively clean movie.  But the standards of today are already so low, that even the cleanest of movies has a great deal of filth lurking underneath.  The waters of Crocodile Dundee may have been declared clean by many, but beware that the crocodiles of immorality are lurking close at hand, ready to nibble away whatever morals your children may have left.",4,One of Hollywood&#65533;s more family friendly comedies &#65533;but flawed,1015372800,"03 6, 2002",2002,3395,"['return', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'third', 'movie', 'was', 'greeted', 'great', 'deal', 'applause', 'hooray', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'family', 'friendly', 'comedy', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'return', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'once', 'again', 'starring', 'humorous', 'fish-out-of-the-water', 'role', 'time', 'Dundee', 'travels', 'common-law-wife', 'son', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'where', 'uncover', 'smuggling', 'ring', 'action', 'sequences', 'climax', 'end', 'have', 'humour', 'real', 'fun', 'movie', 'Dundee', 'nave', 'Australian', 'big', 'American', 'city', 'Most', 'humour', 'cultural', 'differences', 'pokes', 'fun', 'American', 'culture', 'America', 'own', 'holy', 'grails', 'fast', 'food', 'industry', 'movie', 'business', 'highlights', 'come', 'mind', 'are', 'scene', 'where', 'Dundee', 'up', 'expressway', 'trying', 'rescue', 'skunk', 'drive-through', 'Wendys', 'drive-by', 'mugging', 'backfired', 'Added', 'cultural', 'jokes', 'are', 'slap', 'stick', 'humor', 'typical', 'comedy', 'where', 'villains', 'are', 'treated', 'variety', 'appropriate', 'punishments', 'scenes', 'Australia', 'local', 'aborigine', 'using', 'mobile', 'phone', 'are', 'equally', 'charming', 'family', 'friendly', 'so', 'far', 'amount', 'violence', 'tense', 'chase', 'scene', 'involving', 'gun-toting', 'thugs', 'hungry', 'lions', 'end', 'would', 'be', 'frightening', 'youngsters.Somewhat', 'more', 'disturbing', 'however', 'are', 'oblique', 'more', 'incidental', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'several', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'expressions', 'dozen', 'instances', 'blasphemy', 'really', 'necessary', 'Apparently', 'so', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', 'filled', 'sexual', 'innuendoes', 'numerous', 'ogling', 'rear', 'ends', 'comments', 'nice', 'butt', 'scantily', 'clad', 'babes', 'are', 'abundant', 'hardly', 'modestly', 'dressed', 'female', 'be', 'seen', 'abundant', 'cleavage', 'short', 'skirts', 'provocative', 'comments', 'little', 'discourage', 'lustful', 'thoughts', 'Mick', 'Sue', 'eventual', 'marriage', 'merely', 'make', 'earlier', 'common-law', 'relationship', 'official', 'top', 'off', 'are', 'several', 'jokes', 'homosexuality', 'including', 'scene', 'where', 'Dundee', 'companion', 'enter', 'gay', 'cross-dressing', 'bar', 'Producers', 'are', 'determined', 'include', 'references', 'homosexuality', 'order', 'make', 'desensitized', 'immoral', 'lifestyle', 'are', 'already', 'succeeding', 'evidenced', 'fact', 'many', 'speak', 'movie', 'family', 'friendly', 'way', 'Be', 'warned', 'not', 'way', 'family', 'friendly', 'PG', 'movie', 'introducing', 'children', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'are', 'introducing', 'profanity', 'immorality', 'abundance', 'Even', 'fact', 'Dundee', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'breaking', 'entering', 'order', 'villains', 'little', 'encourage', 'respect', 'authority', 'Mick', 'Dundee', 'may', 'better', 'hero', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'offerings', 'even', 'old', 'fashioned', 'morals', 'America', 'once', 'had.The', 'standards', 'are', 'indeed', 'slipping', 'society', 'standards', 'relatively', 'clean', 'movie', 'standards', 'today', 'are', 'already', 'so', 'low', 'even', 'cleanest', 'movies', 'great', 'deal', 'filth', 'lurking', 'underneath', 'waters', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'declared', 'clean', 'many', 'beware', 'crocodiles', 'immorality', 'are', 'lurking', 'close', 'hand', 'ready', 'nibble', 'away', 'morals', 'children', 'may', 'have', 'left']",N/A

So how does the newest (And probably final) film stack up?Overall, okay and nothing much else.The basic plot is that everybodys favorite Australian croc hunter's wife gets a job in hollywood and so, off they go. When they get there, Nick discovers that there is a big conspiracy afoot at one of the studios and sets out to right the wrong. Along the way, his son, his friend Jacko and him go on some interesting adventures in L.A., from looking down from a big skyscraper, blocking up a freeway and in my favorite sequence, take out a bunch of punks who try to steal money.The humor in this movie is mostley Ho-hum, with nothing really standing out (Although the anamatronic anaconda joke works out well) Several of Dunde's friends show up, including his aborigianie friend and his best mate (I forgot his name) The sad part about the movie is that it goes too fast and that nothing really stands out.Still, if you are a fan of the series, this is worth checking out. I personally think it's a charming diversion, and not as bad as the profesional reviews say.The Good: Its a crocidile Dundee movie, Paul hogan and ""Jacko"" do a great job at acting, nice croc sequence near the beginning, nice ending.The bad: Ho hum jokes, dull movie conspiracy that never takes off.And the Ugly: Ultimitly too short",4,Nick's Back!,1003190400,"10 16, 2001",2001,1403,"['Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'pleasent', 'diversion', 'pass', 'time', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'So', 'how', 'newest', 'probably', 'final', 'film', 'stack', 'up', 'Overall', 'okay', 'nothing', 'much', 'basic', 'plot', 'everybodys', 'favorite', 'Australian', 'croc', 'hunter', 'wife', 'job', 'hollywood', 'so', 'go', 'When', 'get', 'there', 'Nick', 'big', 'conspiracy', 'afoot', 'one', 'studios', 'out', 'right', 'wrong', 'way', 'son', 'friend', 'Jacko', 'go', 'interesting', 'adventures', 'L.A.', 'looking', 'down', 'big', 'skyscraper', 'blocking', 'up', 'freeway', 'favorite', 'sequence', 'take', 'out', 'bunch', 'punks', 'who', 'try', 'steal', 'money.The', 'humor', 'movie', 'mostley', 'Ho-hum', 'nothing', 'really', 'standing', 'out', 'anamatronic', 'anaconda', 'joke', 'out', 'well', 'Several', 'Dunde', 'friends', 'show', 'up', 'including', 'aborigianie', 'friend', 'best', 'mate', 'forgot', 'name', 'sad', 'part', 'movie', 'too', 'fast', 'nothing', 'really', 'out.Still', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'personally', 'think', 'charming', 'diversion', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'profesional', 'reviews', 'say.The', 'Good', 'crocidile', 'Dundee', 'movie', 'Paul', 'hogan', 'Jacko', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'acting', 'nice', 'croc', 'sequence', 'beginning', 'nice', 'ending.The', 'bad', 'Ho', 'hum', 'jokes', 'dull', 'movie', 'conspiracy', 'never', 'Ugly', 'Ultimitly', 'too', 'short']",N/A

It's an old premise really, a character out of its element.  But Paul Hogan handled it all with aplomb and a simple charm that made the character enjoyable.Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles tried to recapture the zeitgeist of the previous two episodes, but, hey, everyone is 15 years older from the original Dundee and that aging is very pronounced.  I had to make my way to [...] to see if Gerry Skilton was still playing Nugget, because it didn't seem like him.  I also noticed that Walter (John Meillon) was conspicuously absent, and I found out it was because Meillon passed away in 1989.  More's the pity... but I don't think Walter could have saved this movie.See, this was really sort of a rehash of Dundee coming to America, only this time he brings Sue (Linda Kozlowski), his common-law wife, Mikey (Serge Cockburn), his son, and Jacko (Alec Wilson), a friend and ""nanny"" for Mikey.  There is some humor in Mick driving Jacko around LA and teaching him the ""way"" of all things American.  It's not a forced humor, either, but it still seems somewhat contrived, as if Mick never really ""got"" the USA in the time that he had lived here before.  Even so, that wasn't the weakest part of the movie.I'd have to say that the conflict was the weakest part.  It's where Mick stumbled across an art theft ring in a movie studio and he defeated the bad guys by leading them on a merry chase through several movie sets.  When it was over, I was thinking that he might go back to Australia with the bad guys right behind him to try and track him in the bush.Instead, that was the end of the movie.It lacked the down-under Rambo flavor that the second movie possessed, and it lacked the true fish out of water aspect of the first.  Today, in 2009, with the characters being another 8 years older, I only hope Paul Hogan doesn't attempt a Crocodile Dundee IV.",2,A Serial's Got to Know its Limitations,1255910400,"10 19, 2009",2009,1955,"['[', 'SPOILERS', ']', 'loved', 'Crocodile', 'Dundees', 'II', 'premise', 'was', 'unique', 'interesting', 'action', 'riveting', 'old', 'premise', 'really', 'character', 'element', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'handled', 'aplomb', 'simple', 'charm', 'made', 'character', 'enjoyable.Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'tried', 'recapture', 'zeitgeist', 'previous', 'two', 'episodes', 'hey', 'everyone', '15', 'years', 'older', 'original', 'Dundee', 'aging', 'very', 'pronounced', 'had', 'make', 'way', '[', ']', 'see', 'Gerry', 'Skilton', 'was', 'still', 'playing', 'Nugget', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'also', 'noticed', 'Walter', 'John', 'Meillon', 'was', 'conspicuously', 'absent', 'found', 'was', 'because', 'Meillon', 'passed', 'away', '1989', 'More', 'pity', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Walter', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'movie.See', 'was', 'really', 'sort', 'rehash', 'Dundee', 'coming', 'America', 'only', 'time', 'Sue', 'Linda', 'Kozlowski', 'common-law', 'wife', 'Mikey', 'Serge', 'Cockburn', 'son', 'Jacko', 'Alec', 'Wilson', 'friend', 'nanny', 'Mikey', 'humor', 'Mick', 'driving', 'Jacko', 'LA', 'teaching', 'way', 'things', 'American', 'not', 'forced', 'humor', 'either', 'still', 'somewhat', 'contrived', 'Mick', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'USA', 'time', 'had', 'lived', 'here', 'before', 'Even', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'weakest', 'part', 'movie.I', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'conflict', 'was', 'weakest', 'part', 'where', 'Mick', 'stumbled', 'art', 'theft', 'ring', 'movie', 'studio', 'defeated', 'bad', 'guys', 'leading', 'merry', 'chase', 'several', 'movie', 'sets', 'When', 'was', 'was', 'thinking', 'might', 'go', 'back', 'Australia', 'bad', 'guys', 'right', 'try', 'track', 'bush.Instead', 'was', 'end', 'movie.It', 'lacked', 'down-under', 'Rambo', 'flavor', 'second', 'movie', 'possessed', 'lacked', 'true', 'fish', 'water', 'aspect', 'first', 'Today', '2009', 'characters', 'being', '8', 'years', 'older', 'only', 'hope', 'Paul', 'Hogan', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'IV']",N/A

It's not the terrible movie a lot of people say is though. It's cute, not really a bad movie, not great but nothing to really hate about it.  Paul Hogan is fun and he has some good lines. The plot is bad and it's lacking the musical score that I loved from the original two films. The film needing a villain just wasn't necessary either.Paul Hogan has a lot of chram though. Watching this guy explaining the world of L.A. to his son or his big lug Croc hunting friend is just a delight.

666701,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005N5SD,Reviewer,"[2, 3]","In general, life can be a most trying proposition even in the best of times; and simply negotiating the daily grind can be exasperating for even the most resilient among us.  And that's why it's so refreshing to find respite from the drama of day-to-day living-- a safe haven, if you will-- even if it's only for a couple of hours or so at the movies, which is just what you get with the light-hearted comedy, ""Crocodile Dundee In Los Angeles,"" directed by Simon Wincer.  In this third installment of the ""Dundee"" series, once again starring Paul Hogan as the famed and fearless crocodile hunter, Mick Dundee, we find Mick, his significant other, Sue Charleton (Linda Kozlowski) and their fourth-grade son, Mikey (Serge Cockburn) living in a small hamlet (population 20) in Australia on the cusp of the Outback.  When the editor of Sue's father's West Coast office of his newspaper in America dies suddenly, Mr. Charleton asks his journalist daughter to fill in for a few weeks until he can find a permanent replacement.  So it's off to Los Angeles for Mick, Sue and Mikey, where Sue quickly finds herself involved with the investigation of a shady new movie studio, while Mick gets work there as an extra on their latest production.  There's also plenty of time for Mick and Mikey to explore the terrain of the big city, which is new territory for Mikey, but for Mick-- already a veteran of a trip to New York-- it becomes just one g'day after another, mate.  Which is really what this film is all about.  And it works.It's light fare from the outset, and Wincer does a good job of keeping it all on track and presenting the material in just the right way.  It's casual fun and a lot of laughs, and though there's a lot of sight-gags and physical humor it's never overblown or slapstick, which keeps the rhythm of the film intact and makes the humor flow quite naturally.  In short, Wincer has the formula down for what works here, and he never attempts to make this film anything other than what it is, which makes it easy for the audience to just go with it and enjoy the proceedings.Hogan has a charismatic screen presence, and as Mick he's so laid back that you feel relaxed just watching him.  He makes his character real, and the way he under-reacts to just about any given situation makes the story refreshingly and readily accessible.  Watching this movie is kind of like spending some time with an old friend; it's a fun and pleasant experience, and makes you glad you got together after all these years.  Like the film itself, Hogan never attempts to make Mick anything other than what he is, which is a guy who happens to hunt crocodiles for a living.  And that's an aspect he could easily have tried to play upon, approaching it from the perspective that this is a rather ""odd"" occupation compared to the average guy on the street.  But he doesn't take that route, opting instead to make Mick just another average guy on the street, like the clerk at the store or the mailman.  And it lends credibility to the character, as well as the story, inasmuch as the plot is fairly insignificant in light of the fact that this movie is really about the characters and the way they interact, as opposed to what the storyline is.  It's good work by Hogan, who has created a character who is so likable and real, while Hogan the actor, in retrospect, is destined to be under appreciated for it.  It's one of those instances in which it's too hard to separate the actor from the character, which in essence is a tribute to the quality of Hogan's performance.After being absent from the big screen for some six years, it's good to see Linda Kozlowski back reprising her role of Sue Charlton.  As an actor, she is talented, has an extremely natural screen presence and is absolutely gorgeous; it's a shame she hasn't made more than a half dozen movies or so since ""Dundee II"" in 1988.  Her role here is fairly straightforward, but she plays it so well, and with such facility, that it's the kind of performance that is easily and too often overlooked.  And she plays well opposite Hogan (but then, she should; they're married in real life).  She's a gifted actor, and hopefully we'll see much more of her in the near future; her continued presence would be a real asset to the cinematic community.Serge Cockburn, meanwhile, does a good turn as Mikey; he's a likable youngster with a natural talent that was a definite asset to this film.  Also helping to sell the movie is Alec Wilson, as Jacko, Mick's friend from Australia who follows him to L.A. to join in the fray, and who adds some laughs along the way.The supporting cast includes Jere Burns (Rothman), Jonathan Banks (Milos), Aida Turturro (Jean), Paul Rodriguez (Diego), Kaitlin Hopkins (Miss Mathis), Gerry Skilton (Nugget) and Steve Rackman (Donk).  An entertaining, uplifting comedy, ""Crocodile Dundee In Los Angeles"" is well crafted and delivered, and will make you feel good and put a smile on your face.  There won't be any Oscars here, but it doesn't matter; this is a film that makes life a little brighter-- for awhile anyway-- and that's not such a bad deal in the grand scheme of things.

Absolutely no effort whatsoever has been made: it's in focus and the microphone never creeps into shot as uninteresting things happen in the most uninteresting way possible while the cast are given uninteresting things to say to bulk out the running time to the contractually agreed length, but that's about it for exertion. That the `plot' revolves around a smuggling operation financing a movie studio producing a guaranteed flop third episode in a dead franchise could possibly be seen as a moment of post-modernism, but it's probably just a desperate cry for help from the screenwriters. All the charm and wit of the first (and to a lesser extent the second) film has vanished, taking the characters and goodwill with them: Paul Hogan is starting to look a leathery as the crocs themselves and the most interesting thing about Linda Kozlowski here is trying to pinpoint the plastic surgery through the soft focus filters she's often shot with and work out how much of her disengaged performance is down to boredom and how much to Botox. Both are saddled with characters that simply aren't believable at their age anymore even if they do now have a rather bland son to acknowledge the passing years. She's a primary school play version of a reporter while somehow Mick Dundee seems to have suddenly become a complete simpleton with no memory of all the things he encountered in the first two films in the hope that the audience will find his newfound ignorance funny rather than simply bewildering - it's not even as if his character took a whack to the head in a contrived plot point, it's just plain lazy writing. Things improve slightly to become vaguely watchable in the last half hour, but that's not exactly a recommendation. Belated threequels are usually desperate attempts from faded stars to revive their career and bank balance, but this is so utterly disinterested in doing anything but visiting the cashpoint that it practically qualifies as a non-film.",3,Third time unlucky,1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,2177,"['great', 'comedy', 'should', 'often', 'appear', 'effortless', ""n't"", 'mean', 'word', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'literally', 'one', 'level', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'said', 'be', 'effortless', 'comedy', 'Absolutely', 'effort', 'whatsoever', 'been', 'made', 'focus', 'microphone', 'never', 'shot', 'uninteresting', 'things', 'happen', 'most', 'uninteresting', 'way', 'possible', 'cast', 'are', 'given', 'uninteresting', 'things', 'say', 'bulk', 'out', 'running', 'time', 'contractually', 'agreed', 'length', 'exertion', 'plot', 'revolves', 'smuggling', 'operation', 'financing', 'movie', 'studio', 'producing', 'guaranteed', 'flop', 'third', 'episode', 'dead', 'franchise', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'seen', 'moment', 'post-modernism', 'probably', 'just', 'desperate', 'cry', 'help', 'screenwriters', 'charm', 'wit', 'first', 'lesser', 'extent', 'second', 'film', 'vanished', 'taking', 'characters', 'goodwill', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'starting', 'look', 'leathery', 'crocs', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'Linda', 'Kozlowski', 'here', 'trying', 'pinpoint', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'soft', 'focus', 'filters', 'often', 'shot', 'work', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'disengaged', 'performance', 'down', 'boredom', 'how', 'much', 'Botox', 'are', 'saddled', 'characters', 'simply', 'are', ""n't"", 'believable', 'age', 'anymore', 'even', 'do', 'now', 'have', 'rather', 'bland', 'son', 'acknowledge', 'passing', 'years', 'primary', 'school', 'play', 'version', 'reporter', 'somehow', 'Mick', 'Dundee', 'have', 'suddenly', 'become', 'complete', 'simpleton', 'memory', 'things', 'encountered', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'hope', 'audience', 'will', 'find', 'newfound', 'ignorance', 'funny', 'rather', 'simply', 'bewildering', 'not', 'even', 'character', 'took', 'whack', 'head', 'contrived', 'plot', 'point', 'just', 'plain', 'lazy', 'writing', 'Things', 'improve', 'slightly', 'become', 'vaguely', 'watchable', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'not', 'exactly', 'recommendation', 'Belated', 'threequels', 'are', 'usually', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'faded', 'stars', 'revive', 'career', 'bank', 'balance', 'so', 'utterly', 'disinterested', 'doing', 'anything', 'visiting', 'cashpoint', 'practically', 'non-film']",N/A

The film is funny and family oriented. The plot is more believable than many big budgeted affairs and there is very little violence and no sleaze. The only major drawback about the movie is that it has been thirteen years since the last Crocodile Dundee film. The movie fits well within the trilogy, but since it has been so long since the last movie was in theatres, much of the movie's humor is lost on the audience (there are several references to Mick's character or things that happened previously, something you don't know much about unless you've seen the other films; this is an 80's type comedy with a modern sensibility, but if you've never seen an 80's comedy much of the humor will be lost).
