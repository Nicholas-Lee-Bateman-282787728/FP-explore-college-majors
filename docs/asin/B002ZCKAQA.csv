And yes the graphics were not the best. But if you've seen computer graphics, then you'd say that they look good. As for the deaths, there are many cut scenes that don't basically show you how the people got attacked and murdered by the beast. And the wounds, cut off heads look cheap but not as cheap as in many other low budget movies. It looks unreal but it doesn't look that bad. The acting is actually not bad at all. The witch might some more practice in acting as a witch but as for other characters, I'd say they did good, but could do better. The movie gives away it's own atmosphere. I like the dark fairy tale. I'd say, there are good actors, actresses in here. I like how they've changed the tale.

But, going in, all I ever saw was Estella Warren. But they were right, omigosh, were they right. 2009's Beauty & the Beast: A Dark Tale (a.k.a. Beauty & the Beasts, a.k.a. Beauty & the Beast: A Jumped-Up SKit at the Renaissance Fair - okay, maybe not this second one) is a worthwhile watch only if you're chillin' with your sardonic lads and a kegger or two into your cups. But I should've listened to my homies.This movie opens in the royal chambers of some nondescript castle as relatives of no mean ambition hover like vultures over the death bed of ancient King Maximillian XIII, awaiting the naming of his heir. The expiring king mumbles something about fetching his son, and you see the folks gathered trade nonplussed expressions, because the king's son had died many years ago.Focus now on some nondescript village and into one humble abode. There, the washerwoman's adventurous daughter Belle (Warren) has her latest concoction - essence of oak, oil of pine, camphor leaf - ignite in her face, black smoke pluming in the household (and can you doubt that this accidental smoke bomb will resurface later on?). Off Belle goes to the forest to collect more ingredients, and she promptly runs into monsters.If this is director David Lister's bid for darker twist on the Beauty and the Beast fable, well, he bo11ocksed it up. This is Lister's second stab at Beauty and the Beast, having done a Viking version in 2005 titledBlood of Beasts- and even THAT was better than this. The core plot of this one has the Beast (Victor Parascos) framed for the savage murders of errant villagers. What the locals don't know is that the culprit is a troll conjured up by the comely Lady Helen of Osberg (a theatrical Vanessa Gray) who is reputed to be a foul witch.The Beast himself is a reclusive woodsman and hunter with a mutated countenance. Give Belle credit now for not succumbing to first impressions. Well, yeah, at first she freaks out. But wouldn't you, too? You know the classic story. At least the director keeps faith with that arc. So sit back as Lister tries to spin a tale as old as time except, in his version, Belle flaunts a pair of Botox lips and strolls around in a mini-skirt accented with a brown vinyl corset. Uh, on second thought, verisimilitude be damned, I'm okay with Estella Warren in that inappropriate outfit. Her looking so good in a mini-skirt is what redeems her just-right-for-Syfy acting. I will say that for as much as Belle is victimized here, she has an equal number of scenes in which she handles her business.Of the acting, I'll mention that the best of the lot is Rhett Giles as the ruthless Count Rudolph, and even Giles was reaching. There's no point in savaging the film. Let's leave it at that the screenplay is underdeveloped and amateurish. The CGI is embarrassing and poorly implemented; the troll looks like a pissed-off plucked turkey. Anachronism is the watchword of the day as the cast speaks in very non-medieval dialogue. I did like one rival mockingly calling Count Rudolph ""Rudy."" All these flaws could have been dismissed if only the two leads were able to muster up sparks. Instead, their romance feels very forced and tagged on. And, oh, what the hell, let's do keep on savaging the film. A few take-away notes:- I hope the film crew returned the LARP costumes in time- In the witch's lair Belle grabs a random potion off the witch's worktable to apply to her friend's fatal wound... because it's the smart thing to do- Okay, this one's really nitpicky but I dare you not to snort when the Beast's curse is lifted and he turns into a handsome prince, but so do the Beast's filthy rags shimmer into royal garments- High, high up on the tower rests the witch's lair but not high enough that Belle couldn't casually and accurately lob a smoke bomb into its window",2,cleavage and the Beast,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,3908,"['Will', 'history', 'teach', 'nothing', ""'ve"", 'had', 'cohorts', 'minions', 'try', 'warn', 'off', 'Syfy', 'flick', 'going', 'ever', 'saw', 'was', 'Estella', 'Warren', 'were', 'right', 'omigosh', 'were', 'right', '2009', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Dark', 'Tale', 'a.k.a', 'Beauty', 'Beasts', 'a.k.a', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Jumped-Up', 'SKit', 'Renaissance', 'Fair', 'okay', 'maybe', 'not', 'second', 'one', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'only', ""'re"", 'chillin', 'sardonic', 'lads', 'kegger', 'two', 'cups', 'should', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'homies.This', 'movie', 'royal', 'chambers', 'nondescript', 'castle', 'relatives', 'mean', 'ambition', 'hover', 'vultures', 'death', 'bed', 'ancient', 'King', 'Maximillian', 'XIII', 'awaiting', 'naming', 'heir', 'expiring', 'king', 'mumbles', 'something', 'fetching', 'son', 'see', 'folks', 'gathered', 'trade', 'nonplussed', 'expressions', 'king', 'son', 'had', 'died', 'many', 'years', 'ago.Focus', 'now', 'nondescript', 'village', 'one', 'humble', 'abode', 'washerwoman', 'adventurous', 'daughter', 'Belle', 'Warren', 'latest', 'concoction', 'essence', 'oak', 'oil', 'pine', 'camphor', 'leaf', 'ignite', 'face', 'black', 'smoke', 'pluming', 'household', 'can', 'doubt', 'accidental', 'smoke', 'bomb', 'will', 'resurface', 'later', 'Belle', 'forest', 'collect', 'more', 'ingredients', 'promptly', 'monsters.If', 'director', 'David', 'Lister', 'bid', 'darker', 'twist', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'fable', 'well', 'bo11ocksed', 'up', 'Lister', 'second', 'stab', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'having', 'done', 'Viking', 'version', '2005', 'titledBlood', 'Beasts-', 'even', 'THAT', 'was', 'better', 'core', 'plot', 'one', 'Beast', 'Victor', 'Parascos', 'framed', 'savage', 'murders', 'errant', 'villagers', 'What', 'locals', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'culprit', 'troll', 'conjured', 'up', 'comely', 'Lady', 'Helen', 'Osberg', 'theatrical', 'Vanessa', 'Gray', 'who', 'reputed', 'be', 'foul', 'witch.The', 'Beast', 'reclusive', 'woodsman', 'hunter', 'mutated', 'countenance', 'Give', 'Belle', 'credit', 'now', 'not', 'succumbing', 'first', 'impressions', 'Well', 'yeah', 'first', 'out', 'would', ""n't"", 'too', 'know', 'classic', 'story', 'least', 'director', 'faith', 'arc', 'sit', 'back', 'Lister', 'spin', 'tale', 'as', 'old', 'time', 'version', 'Belle', 'pair', 'Botox', 'lips', 'strolls', 'mini-skirt', 'accented', 'brown', 'vinyl', 'corset', 'Uh', 'second', 'thought', 'verisimilitude', 'be', 'damned', ""'m"", 'okay', 'Estella', 'Warren', 'inappropriate', 'outfit', 'looking', 'so', 'good', 'mini-skirt', 'what', 'just-right-for-Syfy', 'acting', 'will', 'say', 'as', 'much', 'Belle', 'victimized', 'here', 'equal', 'number', 'scenes', 'business.Of', 'acting', ""'ll"", 'mention', 'best', 'lot', 'Rhett', 'Giles', 'ruthless', 'Count', 'Rudolph', 'even', 'Giles', 'was', 'reaching', 'point', 'savaging', 'film', 'Let', 'leave', 'screenplay', 'underdeveloped', 'amateurish', 'CGI', 'embarrassing', 'poorly', 'implemented', 'troll', 'pissed-off', 'plucked', 'turkey', 'Anachronism', 'watchword', 'day', 'cast', 'speaks', 'very', 'non-medieval', 'dialogue', 'did', 'like', 'one', 'rival', 'mockingly', 'calling', 'Count', 'Rudolph', 'Rudy', 'flaws', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dismissed', 'only', 'two', 'leads', 'were', 'able', 'muster', 'up', 'sparks', 'Instead', 'romance', 'feels', 'very', 'forced', 'tagged', 'oh', 'what', 'hell', 'let', 'do', 'keep', 'savaging', 'film', 'few', 'take-away', 'notes', 'hope', 'film', 'crew', 'returned', 'LARP', 'costumes', 'time-', 'witch', 'lair', 'Belle', 'random', 'potion', 'witch', 'worktable', 'apply', 'friend', 'fatal', 'wound', 'smart', 'thing', 'do-', 'Okay', 'one', 'really', 'nitpicky', 'dare', 'not', 'snort', 'when', 'Beast', 'curse', 'lifted', 'handsome', 'prince', 'so', 'do', 'Beast', 'filthy', 'rags', 'shimmer', 'royal', 'garments-', 'High', 'high', 'up', 'tower', 'witch', 'lair', 'not', 'high', 'enough', 'Belle', 'could', ""n't"", 'casually', 'accurately', 'lob', 'smoke', 'bomb', 'window']",N/A

1299470,A6X6LNZO1C3EZ,B002ZCKAQA,J. Munyon,"[2, 3]","Let me address some obvious expectations from the cover art and because of the title.  This DVD does not contain nudity of the actress portraying Belle.  It is also quite far from being appropriate for children.  The story is partially narrated as if this were a fairy tale, but with the violence, gore, and demon-troll conjured up by a sorceress with many potions, powders, candles, daggers, witchcraft of a dark nature, and spite; let's just say this is not a bedtime story.  Rated R, this 2010 film is said to be a suspense / fantasy / thriller starring Estella Warren, Rhett Giles, Victor Parascos, Vanessa Gray, Tony Bellette, Chris Betts, Rachel Binder, Rachel Clark, Gabriella Di Labio, and was filmed in the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia and Warner Bros Movieworld - Pacific Highway, Oxenford, Queensland, Australia.  Directed by David Lister, this 90 minute movie has many versions that besides the USA was also shown in Greece, Lebanon, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, and India and France.  There aren't any pitchfork impalements, and the FX for the beheadings isn't all that impressive.  From what I understand, this was on TV's SyFy channel.  Most fans of the traditional story know there are many, many productions using the name ""Beauty and the Beast,"" my favorites include the 1976 version with George C. Scott, of course the Disney version in 1991, and the 1967 TV series with Ron Perlman as Vincent and Linda Hamilton as Catherine.  Let me be clear, THIS particular DVD presentation is not among that list.  It will take being a seriously enthusiastic fan of the Beauty and the Beast genre to get much out of this DVD version.

1299472,A1WY1U223QB0IB,B002ZCKAQA,"R. Hawk ""Jubal_Early""","[2, 2]","I first found out about this 2011 film the other day browsing at the video rental store and picked it up. I really thought it was pretty good. I would rate it almost on a par with an episode of the TV series Legend of the Seeker, though that series has somewhat better writing and production quality.I think Estella Warren is simply fabulous. She's a bit of a struggling actress from a former career in modeling and if I recall correctly, a history as an athlete from her native Canada... Many good actresses and actors don't have the option of choosing from premium scripts and starring roles like the A list people do, and they must settle for films like this and do the best they can with them.When I saw Estella in the 2001 Mark Wahlberg remake of Planet of the Apes I thought she was great too, but she didn't get much attention or the best role in my opinion, as she was overshadowed by Helena Bonham Carter's character.So Estella's acting may not be on a par with the top actresses of our day, but I think she does a pretty bang up job with what she gets offered, and she just seems to me like a real sweetheart. I'd pretty much watch anything she has a role in just to see her.The story itself has a somewhat unique twist on the Beauty and the Beast theme and they obviously went to some effort to get the ""period"" setting correct in the film with costumes, armor etc, though the special effects and gore might have been a bit off to the taste of many. Overall though the cast did a good job with what they had before them.You have to expect that any movie that doesn't get huge box office attention is probably not going to be something that is extremely moving or deep drama. Just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy this for the fun romp into a twisted fantasy world that it is.And tell me afterwards if you wouldn't want the wench, the trollop, riding on horseback with YOU through the forests searching for the Beast!Among the extras on the DVD are interviews with the cast, and Estella's focuses on the fact that she talks about how most women would like to be the fair maiden in a fantasy world drama, and that's what drew her to the role... That's a good attitude to have for a B film like this, and I can think of no one better to fill such a role than her.",5,"Good, Somewhat Campy Fun",1353456000,"11 21, 2012",2012,2275,"['first', 'found', 'out', '2011', 'film', 'other', 'day', 'browsing', 'video', 'rental', 'store', 'picked', 'up', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'would', 'rate', 'almost', 'par', 'episode', 'TV', 'series', 'Legend', 'Seeker', 'series', 'somewhat', 'better', 'writing', 'production', 'quality.I', 'think', 'Estella', 'Warren', 'simply', 'fabulous', 'bit', 'struggling', 'actress', 'former', 'career', 'modeling', 'recall', 'correctly', 'history', 'athlete', 'native', 'Canada', 'Many', 'good', 'actresses', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'option', 'choosing', 'premium', 'scripts', 'starring', 'roles', 'A', 'list', 'people', 'do', 'must', 'settle', 'films', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'them.When', 'saw', 'Estella', '2001', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'remake', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'too', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'attention', 'best', 'role', 'opinion', 'was', 'overshadowed', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'character.So', 'Estella', 'acting', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'par', 'top', 'actresses', 'day', 'think', 'pretty', 'bang', 'up', 'job', 'what', 'offered', 'just', 'real', 'sweetheart', ""'d"", 'pretty', 'much', 'watch', 'anything', 'role', 'just', 'see', 'her.The', 'story', 'somewhat', 'unique', 'twist', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'theme', 'obviously', 'went', 'effort', 'get', 'period', 'setting', 'correct', 'film', 'costumes', 'armor', 'etc', 'special', 'effects', 'gore', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'taste', 'many', 'Overall', 'cast', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'what', 'had', 'them.You', 'have', 'expect', 'movie', ""n't"", 'get', 'huge', 'box', 'office', 'attention', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'something', 'extremely', 'moving', 'deep', 'drama', 'Just', 'sit', 'back', 'popcorn', 'enjoy', 'fun', 'romp', 'twisted', 'fantasy', 'world', 'tell', 'afterwards', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'wench', 'trollop', 'riding', 'horseback', 'YOU', 'forests', 'searching', 'Beast', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'interviews', 'cast', 'Estella', 'focuses', 'fact', 'how', 'most', 'women', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'fair', 'maiden', 'fantasy', 'world', 'drama', 'what', 'drew', 'role', 'good', 'attitude', 'have', 'B', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'one', 'better', 'fill', 'role']",N/A

It reminded me a lot of the ""Hercules"" and ""Xena"" TV shows, without the witty dialog.  It was a made for TV movie (I think) so I can't be too harsh on the effects, but when someone's head gets cut off and 2 little squirts of blood show up, I mean come on.
