With the talents of the hilarious Bernie Mac and the up and comer Ashton Kutcher, I expected to be rolling on the floor through the whole thing! I hardly laughed at all! The whole movie was ludicrious and looked like a 'Meet the Parents' rip off. It in no way compared to the original that the moved was supposed to be based on 'Guess who's coming to dinner.' The ending especially was awful. It was too syrupy sweet and did not feel true to life. Skip it and rent either the original 'Guess who's coming to dinner' or 'Meet the parents' instead.",3,GUESS WHO? is a LAME comedy,1123372800,"08 7, 2005",2005,605,"['just', 'got', 'done', 'watching', 'Guess', 'Who', 'was', 'disappointed', 'talents', 'hilarious', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'up', 'comer', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'expected', 'be', 'rolling', 'floor', 'whole', 'thing', 'hardly', 'laughed', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'ludicrious', 'looked', ""'Meet"", 'Parents', 'rip', 'way', 'compared', 'original', 'moved', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', ""'Guess"", 'who', 'coming', 'dinner', 'ending', 'especially', 'was', 'awful', 'was', 'too', 'syrupy', 'sweet', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'true', 'life', 'Skip', 'rent', 'original', ""'Guess"", 'who', 'coming', 'dinner', ""'Meet"", 'parents', 'instead']",N/A

The reason that many people here have given negative points is because it deals with the subject which makes many people uncomfortable, but as I said that if you watch this movie with open mind, you will definitely love it. The story is about a black girl (Zoe Saldana) who is in love with a white boy (Ashton Kutcher) and wants to announce their engagement on her parent's 25th marriage anniversary. Her dad (Bernie Mac) won't approve the white guy, not because he is a racist, but also uncomfortable about his daughter's relation with him. The movie is all fun, can be watched with family and as said before will keep everyone laughing.Bernie Mac's character as Percy Jones is awesome, and he the one character you will keep watching the movie for. Ashton Kutcher, is all right and improvement in his acting is evident. Other actors are ok.

910990,ANYRXHDVOVS17,B0009RCPUW,A. Customer,"[3, 8]","Bernie is funny as hell--I can watch him all day.  Ashton is sweet, and bumbling.  Zoe is cute.  Ashton and Zoe make a beautiful couple.  The racist joke-scene is excellent.  The metrosexual stuff is clever, and upon second viewing very funny.The problems (and there are problems) with this movie have been touched on somewhat by the other reviewers, but I shall try to lay them to rest here once and for all by nailing them on the head.First, the film takes the wrong approach to the race issue by modeling ""MEET THE PARENTS"" rather than ""GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER.""  This film should have been less misleadingly named ""MEET THE BLACK PARENTS.""  The chosen approach, as it is, makes parental approval of ""the boy"" the focus of the film, rather than the larger issue of societal approval of ""the interracial union.""  There is a big difference between our cheering for Bernie to accept this sweet, noble kid (and how could he not?) and our applauding of societal change.Second, the film is blatantly dishonest in a manner typical of sitcoms.  As we all know, in order to garner laughs week after week, the sitcom offers a watered-down, ""safe"", toothless reflection of contemporary truth.  Everybody seems to get along.  The problems are always superficial and the main characters can always point to someone off-set as ""the cause of the world's ills.""  There are too few exceptions to this rule--""All in the Family,"" ""The Jeffersons,"" ""Good Times""--and even they become watered down after the first few seasons and start feeling ""safe.""And there is the key to this movie's dishonesty.  We feel safe watching it.  Why is that?  Why do we Americans (with our history) feel safe watching a movie about race?  We do NOT feel safe watching the original ""GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER,"" not at all, despite the genuine humor in it.  We feel safe with this one because we know right up front that the premise is not . . . honest.  It's funny, true, silly as heck, true, but not honest: a successful black man is upset because his daughter has brought home a fiance who is handsome, well-mannered, successful and white.  I'm sorry.  I must have missed something here.  Where is the big problem with THAT?See, for white people this is an issue, but for blacks it is a mere shrug and then dismissal.  The boy is white.  So what.  Most of us have some white in us from way back, if you know what I mean.  Look at how fair skinned some of us are. Look at how fair skinned MOST of us are compared to our brethren straight from Africa.  Oh, every now and then there'll be a snide remark about the boy.  Some jealousy.  Maybe even something a bit stronger.  But for the most part, THAT relationship, as far as African American kin are concerned, will go unnoticed in the course of things.This is not to say that African Americans are not racist.  In many ways African Americans are just as racist as white Americans.  But it is only in the world of TV and movies do black people show THIS PARTICULAR kind of racist sentiment to such a degree that it is worth writing a screenplay about.  Our history tells us that American racism prevented blacks who could afford to from living in neighborhoods with whites of similar earning power.  Our history tells us that American racism prevented blacks from working at jobs they were qualified to do simply because they were not white.  Our history tells us that American racism prevented blacks from attending colleges that they had been accepted into simply because they were not white.  Finally, our history tells us that American racism prevented blacks from marrying people that they were in love with if those people had white skin.  See where I'm going with this?The point is that African Americans, believe it or not, have been fighting since 1865 and then 1968 to live where they could afford to live, to work at jobs they were qualified to hold, to attend colleges that they had been accepted into, and to wed, white or black, those that they had fallen in love with.Do you see the dishonesty now?  Making a movie about a successful black man who does not want his daughter to marry the good, clean, honest man she loves, black or white, is sort of like making a movie about a well educated black man who does not want his bright, gifted child to attend Harvard or Yale or any other top school the child has been accepted into.  ""What?  How dare you turn down your Spellman scholarship for Harvard!  I am so upset with you!""  Well, I'm sure it does happen from time to time, but not often enough to make a fuss (or a big budget movie) about.",4,I like it a little more than I should,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,4578,"['Bernie', 'funny', 'hell', 'can', 'watch', 'day', 'Ashton', 'sweet', 'bumbling', 'Zoe', 'cute', 'Ashton', 'Zoe', 'make', 'beautiful', 'couple', 'racist', 'joke-scene', 'excellent', 'metrosexual', 'stuff', 'clever', 'second', 'viewing', 'very', 'funny.The', 'problems', 'are', 'problems', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'touched', 'somewhat', 'other', 'reviewers', 'shall', 'try', 'lay', 'rest', 'here', 'once', 'nailing', 'head.First', 'film', 'wrong', 'approach', 'race', 'issue', 'modeling', 'MEET', 'THE', 'PARENTS', 'rather', 'GUESS', 'WHO', 'COMING', 'TO', 'DINNER', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'misleadingly', 'named', 'MEET', 'THE', 'BLACK', 'PARENTS', 'chosen', 'approach', 'parental', 'approval', 'boy', 'focus', 'film', 'rather', 'larger', 'issue', 'societal', 'approval', 'interracial', 'union', 'big', 'difference', 'cheering', 'Bernie', 'accept', 'sweet', 'noble', 'kid', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'applauding', 'societal', 'change.Second', 'film', 'blatantly', 'dishonest', 'manner', 'typical', 'sitcoms', 'know', 'order', 'garner', 'laughs', 'week', 'week', 'sitcom', 'watered-down', 'safe', 'toothless', 'reflection', 'contemporary', 'truth', 'Everybody', 'get', 'along', 'problems', 'are', 'always', 'superficial', 'main', 'characters', 'can', 'always', 'point', 'someone', 'off-set', 'cause', 'world', 'ills', 'are', 'too', 'few', 'exceptions', 'rule', 'Family', 'Jeffersons', 'Good', 'Times', 'even', 'become', 'watered', 'down', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'start', 'feeling', 'safe', 'key', 'movie', 'dishonesty', 'feel', 'safe', 'watching', 'Why', 'Why', 'do', 'Americans', 'history', 'feel', 'safe', 'watching', 'movie', 'race', 'do', 'NOT', 'feel', 'safe', 'watching', 'original', 'GUESS', 'WHO', 'COMING', 'TO', 'DINNER', 'not', 'genuine', 'humor', 'feel', 'safe', 'one', 'know', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'premise', 'not', 'honest', 'funny', 'true', 'silly', 'heck', 'true', 'not', 'honest', 'successful', 'black', 'man', 'upset', 'daughter', 'brought', 'home', 'fiance', 'who', 'handsome', 'well-mannered', 'successful', 'white', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'something', 'here', 'Where', 'big', 'problem', 'See', 'white', 'people', 'issue', 'blacks', 'mere', 'shrug', 'then', 'dismissal', 'boy', 'white', 'So', 'what', 'Most', 'have', 'white', 'way', 'back', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Look', 'how', 'fair', 'skinned', 'are', 'Look', 'how', 'fair', 'skinned', 'MOST', 'are', 'compared', 'brethren', 'straight', 'Africa', 'Oh', 'now', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'snide', 'remark', 'boy', 'jealousy', 'Maybe', 'even', 'something', 'bit', 'stronger', 'most', 'part', 'THAT', 'relationship', 'as', 'far', 'African', 'American', 'kin', 'are', 'concerned', 'will', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'course', 'things.This', 'not', 'say', 'African', 'Americans', 'are', 'not', 'racist', 'many', 'ways', 'African', 'Americans', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'racist', 'white', 'Americans', 'only', 'world', 'TV', 'movies', 'do', 'black', 'people', 'show', 'THIS', 'PARTICULAR', 'kind', 'racist', 'sentiment', 'degree', 'worth', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'history', 'American', 'racism', 'prevented', 'blacks', 'who', 'could', 'afford', 'living', 'neighborhoods', 'whites', 'similar', 'earning', 'power', 'history', 'American', 'racism', 'prevented', 'blacks', 'working', 'jobs', 'were', 'qualified', 'do', 'simply', 'were', 'not', 'white', 'history', 'American', 'racism', 'prevented', 'blacks', 'attending', 'colleges', 'had', 'been', 'accepted', 'simply', 'were', 'not', 'white', 'Finally', 'history', 'American', 'racism', 'prevented', 'blacks', 'marrying', 'people', 'were', 'love', 'people', 'had', 'white', 'skin', 'See', 'where', ""'m"", 'going', 'point', 'African', 'Americans', 'believe', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'fighting', '1865', 'then', '1968', 'live', 'where', 'could', 'afford', 'live', 'work', 'jobs', 'were', 'qualified', 'hold', 'attend', 'colleges', 'had', 'been', 'accepted', 'wed', 'white', 'black', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'with.Do', 'see', 'dishonesty', 'now', 'Making', 'movie', 'successful', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'want', 'daughter', 'marry', 'good', 'clean', 'honest', 'man', 'black', 'white', 'sort', 'making', 'movie', 'well', 'educated', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'want', 'bright', 'gifted', 'child', 'attend', 'Harvard', 'Yale', 'other', 'top', 'school', 'child', 'been', 'accepted', 'What', 'How', 'dare', 'turn', 'down', 'Spellman', 'scholarship', 'Harvard', 'am', 'so', 'upset', 'Well', ""'m"", 'sure', 'happen', 'time', 'time', 'not', 'often', 'enough', 'make', 'fuss', 'big', 'budget', 'movie']",N/A

910993,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0009RCPUW,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","There's really nothing new within `Guess Who' but that doesn't make it worth the sit down.  It's pretty much `Meet the Parents' redux without the brilliance that was Robert DeNiro, but it's funny in it's own right and offers enough humor to satisfy the average moviegoer.  It's a comedic remake of the classic film `Guess Who's Coming to Dinner', a film that at the time was pushing boundaries and asking important questions.  Now the issue of race is more a forced discussion topic as apposed to a real problem.  Racism, while it does still exist, is mostly embellished and scrutinized in an unreasonable way and thus becomes more of an annoyance than a real problem.  The point being that there is no real morale center to `Guess Who' despite the point that Bernie Mac's character may be a tad bit racist in his viewpoints.  `Guess Who' is mainly just good ol' fun.When Percy and Marilyn decide to renew their wedding vows after 25 years of marriage they are pleased to find out they are to meet their daughter's boyfriend, but when he turns out to be white Percy is not pleased and becomes determined to find something, anything wrong with Simon in order to ruin his chances with his daughter.  Simon is just trying to make a good impression but nothing he does will ever be good enough.  In the end of course there is some reckoning on the parts of both Percy and Simon and they all become one big happy family, but getting there, while familiar, is still fun.Ashton Kutcher does a fine job of filling in Ben Stiller's shoes.  Notice I will continue to liken `Guess Who' to `Meet the Parents' mainly because they come across in sections to be the same film.  Ashton is funny when he needs to be, convincing, and precisely on point when it comes to Simon.  He may not be the most talented bird in the coop, but he does do this brand of comedy well.  Bernie Mac is also funny, but he can't live up to the award worthy brilliance that was Robert DeNiro.  DeNiro delivered each line so convincingly, so effortlessly hilariously dead-pan while Bernie Mac seems to be overwhelmed at times as if he knows he can't truly stack up.  The rest of the characters are mainly background noise.  Zoe Saldana doesn't have to do anything but be gorgeous, and that she is, and Judith Scott, well she's no Blythe Danner that's for sure.In the end `Guess Who' is worth the watch through.

For instance,on the CBS sitcom THE JEFFERSONS,Tom Willis,a caucasian and his negro wife Helen Douglas Willis. Bernie Mac is Percy Jones,the role portrayed by Sidney Poitier in the original film. At first Percy is initially shocked but welcomes Simon Green(Ashton Kutcher),a caucasian,to the family with open arms. Simon is engaged to Percy's daughter Teresa(Zoe Saldana). Also Percy and his wife Marilyn are renewing their wedding vows on their 25th anniversary. At a family gathering,Simon is telling skin color jokes and everybody laughs until he tells the final,offensive one. Percy and Simon sleep in the same bed for a few nights. Of course,Percy and Marilyn have a big fight just before the big vow renewal,as do Simon and Teresa. Percy and Simon are Wall Street stocktraders,and Simon ends up quitting. But Percy tells that Simon was terminated(""He's broke,unemployed and loves my daughter.""). In the final scene,we see DVD menus of the videotaped vow renewal. I thought this film suddenly broke and I had to navigate with my own player! I also thought if this film was anything like the Jeffersons,I'd enjoy it. And it was somewhat,with a once-mention of ""honky"" by Percy's father. Also,pre-JEFFERSONS,the late Isabel Sanford appeared in the original film. Also get a load of Percy and Simon racing cars. One of Teresa's sisters is named Keshia,probably inspired by the Cosby Show actress Keshia Knight Pulliam.

'Guess Who' however was incredibly predictable and slow moving at times. While there were a lot of ""funny"" parts in the movie, there was nothing in it that I laughed out loud at. The jokes were forced out for the most part, and the actors looked like they were going through the motions. There didn't seem to be much chemistry between the the leading male and female in this. At no point did I feel I was looking at real characters. I just felt I was seeing Bernie Mac playing the role of the father, and Ashton playing the 'boyfriend'.

I hadn't even seen that many previews of the movie. I just heard it was a good film, and I thought I'd check it out.Perhaps if the black love interest in this movie were as 'black' as Sydney Poitier, it would hold a bit more water for me. Once again, though, we black women must battle the eurocentric beauty standard. A white man falls in love with a black woman. Really? I suppose I would have been more intrigued if the woman had kinky hair, wide hips, generous lips and an ethnic nose. This woman looked like a 'europeanized' version of a black woman. I mean, really, make her skin a tad lighter and she could have been white! You wouldn't even have to TOUCH her hair! Forget the fact that the movie wasn't funny, and that I laughed maybe once throughout. Forget the fact that Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher (both of whom I really like) are the leading names in such a watered-down film. I'm talking about the subliminals here. Why would the black father be so uptight about her daughter dating a white guy (notice how he glances around to see what neighbors might be looking when his daughter first steps into the yard with her white boyfriend?) when he lives in what is likely a predominantly white suburb? He's living the life successful white men live every day --- should he even be surprised that his daughter is dating a white man? I have an even harder time believing that, despite this affluent lifestyle the parents lead, we see the wife chucking it up with her very 'black' friends over at her sister's house. You just KNOW that folks like these have got to have some white friends --- so where are THEY in the film??? It all seems to contrived to me, particularly this Cosby-like black fantasy world of affluence and family togetherness. It all feels very made up.

I haven't seen the original but understand it was more of a drama and socially revelant.  The 2005 version shares the plot of a white guy with a black girlfriend coming home to meet the girl's family.  This movie however, is straight comedy, played for laughs.  There could have been some uncomfortable racial situations, but there weren't.I enjoyed this movie a lot.  Kutcher plays Simon, who is dating Theresa and she is black.  She takes him home meet her family without telling her family Simon is white.  Bernie Mac, playing the over protective father Percy, can't believe his daughter is dating a white boy and sets out to make Simon's stay at the house as uncomfortable as possible.  The scenes between Simon and Percy are the best.  Theresa's character takes a back seat in this movie.  She exists because she has too.This is a fun movie that is straight comedy.  There are few moments that try to comment on the problems of interracial relationships, but the movie quickly moves on to another scene of Kutcher or Mac hamming it up from the camera.  Don't hold it against this movie that it is a remake of a classic.  It isn't trying to be better than the original.

Better yet, have you imagined what would happen when you introduced your significant other to your parents? This is the backdrop for this movie, a comedy with some funny moments mixed together with a script that is mostly predictable.This movie is similar to the 1967 classic, ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" and many viewers who enjoyed that movie will want to compare this movie to it. In ""Guess Who"", the same situation is presented, except this time a black woman played by actress Zoe Saldana is bringing home a white man, played by Ashton Kutcher, to meet her parents. Tensions are felt all around, but the person who is most uneasy is Percy Jones, played by actor Bernie Mac. He claims that it doesn't bother him, but he continues to look for ways to break his daughter and her fianc&eacute; up, even though he has always told his kids that they should be color blind and accepting of all people.While Bernie Mack is struggling with his acceptance of his daughter's new boyfriend, he is also trying to plan a party where he and his wife (played by Judith Scott) will renew their wedding vows. Toward the end of the film, his wife gets upset at him and it looks like the party is off. Now, it is up to him to apologize and win back his wife's affections. It is here, at this point, that he realizes how much his wife means to him and how much his daughter means to her boyfriend. This subplot is, again, mostly predictable. But it at least fits into the movie's theme and keeps the movie flowing.Bernie Mack, Zoe Saldana, and Judith Scott are all pretty good in this film and they have a good grip on their respective roles and the personification of their characters. My only reservations are with Ashton Kutcher, who plays the role of Simon Green. His performance seems a little off the mark and the chemistry between him and Zoe Saldana wasn't quite there. Saldana throws her heart into the role, but Kutcher seems like he doesn't rally want to be here.Overall, this film is a good one and it does have some good comedic moments. Its greatest flaws are its predictability and formula- driven script. But I liked it enough to recommend.

Bernie Mac is hilarious as a father who does not take kindly to Ashton Kutcher's bumbly potential son-in-law, and hilarious sparks are ignited all over the place.I believe this movie is highly, HIGHLY original although I will admit it does borrow a little bit from the movie Meet The Parents.  But otherwise it's extremely unique and a comedy classic which is better than old-time movies that had people like Cary Grant and Charlie Chaplin or whatever.  I think Bernie Mac is ridiculously funny, and all you have to do is watch his crazy faces that he makes and you will lose it, I promise you.  If they ever do decide to remake this movie they should think about Sinbad and Sean William Scott, because they're terrific too.I love this movie because it's exactly like real life, and it holds a mirror up to society and shows us that we're all funny like Bernie Mac deep down inside whether we're black, white, red, yellow, or polka-dotted.

Not for Kutcher, of course, who makes Keanu Reeves look like a master thespian, but despite him.  Bernie Mac pretty much carries the movie single-handedly; every scene without him is something of a chore to get through.The premise is very simple.  Percy Jones (Bernie Mac) is quite horrified when his daughter Theresa (Zoe Saldana) brings home her new boyfriend for her parents' twenty-fifth anniversary celebration.  Percy had checked up on our boy Simon Green (Kutcher) and was quite encouraged by his credit report and the fact that he worked for a prestigious investment firm (at least, he did work for a prestigious investment firm - but he quit just before making the trip to meet his prospective in-laws, a fact that no one, including Theresa, knows about yet).  Simon isn't what he was expecting at all, though - not by a long shot.  It has a lot to do with the fact that Simon is white, but let's face it - every father's worst nightmare is the thought of his baby girl bringing Ashton Kutcher home with her.  It's not even completely about race; the boy is just not right in the head, and Percy thinks he's hiding something (which he is).  This father takes extraordinary steps to make sure Simon and his little girl don't get up to any hanky-panky there in his house - and who can blame him for that?  As the days pass, things don't get any better, much comic hilarity ensues (capped off with a round of ethnic jokes told around the dinner table), and there's a big row that temporarily splits up both couples.  Wouldn't it be funny if, just once, a movie didn't go for the pat, obvious ending?  I think it would, but we'll have to wait a little longer to know for sure because Guess Who plays out just as you knew it would.This is a comedy, and it doesn't try to be anything more than that.  Without Bernie Mac, it would have flopped like a fish out of water, but Bernie Mac can make anything funny, even scenes with Ashton Kutcher.  He really ought to get some kind of award for that - maybe a special Oscar for actually making an Ashton Kutcher film funny and enjoyable.",4,"Kutcher's Kutcher, but Bernie Mac makes this entertaining",1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,2254,"['hate', 'admit', 'actually', 'watched', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'movie', 'defense', 'did', 'have', 'very', 'funny', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'much', 'less', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'Not', 'Kutcher', 'course', 'who', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'look', 'master', 'thespian', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'single-handedly', 'scene', 'something', 'chore', 'get', 'through.The', 'premise', 'very', 'simple', 'Percy', 'Jones', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'quite', 'horrified', 'when', 'daughter', 'Theresa', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'home', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'parents', 'twenty-fifth', 'anniversary', 'celebration', 'Percy', 'had', 'checked', 'up', 'boy', 'Simon', 'Green', 'Kutcher', 'was', 'quite', 'encouraged', 'credit', 'report', 'fact', 'worked', 'prestigious', 'investment', 'firm', 'least', 'did', 'work', 'prestigious', 'investment', 'firm', 'quit', 'just', 'making', 'trip', 'meet', 'prospective', 'in-laws', 'fact', 'one', 'including', 'Theresa', 'yet', 'Simon', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'not', 'long', 'shot', 'lot', 'do', 'fact', 'Simon', 'white', 'let', 'face', 'father', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'thought', 'baby', 'girl', 'bringing', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'home', 'not', 'even', 'completely', 'race', 'boy', 'just', 'not', 'right', 'head', 'Percy', 'hiding', 'something', 'father', 'extraordinary', 'steps', 'make', 'sure', 'Simon', 'little', 'girl', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'up', 'hanky-panky', 'house', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'days', 'pass', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'much', 'comic', 'hilarity', 'ensues', 'capped', 'off', 'round', 'ethnic', 'jokes', 'told', 'dinner', 'table', 'big', 'row', 'temporarily', 'up', 'couples', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'funny', 'just', 'once', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'pat', 'obvious', 'ending', 'think', 'would', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'little', 'longer', 'know', 'sure', 'Guess', 'Who', 'out', 'just', 'knew', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'would', 'have', 'flopped', 'fish', 'water', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'can', 'make', 'anything', 'funny', 'even', 'scenes', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'really', 'ought', 'get', 'kind', 'award', 'maybe', 'special', 'Oscar', 'actually', 'making', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'film', 'funny', 'enjoyable']",N/A

This is not a remake of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner""; it does borrow the premise from that Sixties classic of an interracial relationship, and a father having a hard time coming to grips with it.  But aside from that, GUESS WHO stands wonderfully on its own merits--and should be judged accordingly.Bernie Mac as stern and proud papa Percy Jones steals every scene he's in, which is fine with me, as the actor has amazing comedic timing and panache.  Percy and his wife Marilyn (Judith Scott) are celebrating their 25th anniversary by renewing their wedding vows; on top of that, their eldest daughter Theresa (played by a very attractive Zoe Saldana) is bringing her boyfriend home from New York.  Percy just knows his baby girl is in love with a man just like himself:  aggressive, hardnosed, athletic. . .and black.  So when he actually meets his daughter's love interest, a somewhat nerdy guy named Simon (Ashton Kutcher)--a nerdy guy who's white--well, let's just say that's when all the fun starts.And there's plenty of fun in GUESS WHO, as father and boyfriend square off in a battle of wits that had me howling with laughter.

Too bad it has an even smaller fraction of the comic value. This awkward racial comedy is watered down and goofed up, and only Bernie Mac's performance gets a chance to shine. Too bad he wasn't opposite the Wilson brothers.The original 1967 race comedy had a white girl bringing her African-American fiancee home. This time there is a reversal: Percy (Bernie Mac) and wife Marilyn (Judith Scott) are sort-of-eagerly awaiting the arrival of their young daughter Teresa (Zoe Saldana), who is supposed to bring her fiancee there. They expected a nice, financially stable, black man. What they get: A goofy, well-to-do white guy, Simon (Ashton Kutcher).Percy isn't exactly pleased with this, especially after some ""Meet the Parents"" stunts like Simon prancing around in lingerie. He does have to admit that Simon's past career has been ""a thing of beauty,"" but more problems arise when they learn that Simon has actually quit his job recently.I'm not sure why they bill ""Guess Who"" as a remake. It has almost nothing in common with the original -- even the title feels goofily incomplete. (""Guess Who""? Guess who what?) The hot-button race relations are replaced with oddball slapstick. And Sidney Poitier's elegant performance is replaced by... Ashton Kutcher. I think the problems are obvious.But even taken by itself, ""Guess Who"" feels like a race-based version of ""Meet the Parents,"" with the awkward young man meeting his future in-laws, except with an even thinner storyline. Kevin Rodney Sullivan simply doesn't seem to have enough funny scenarios to flesh out a simple storyline, so he fills it in with sitcommish antics and awkward interactions.There is one redeeming factor to this movie -- outside the framework of the 1960s, it displays that racism is not restricted to one race. Unfortunately, it gets mired in scenes like Mac and Kutcher sharing a bed in the basement. It could have had a strong message, but it chickens out.The two leads are a study in opposites. Bernie Mac gives a really fun performance as the father-in-law from hell, and he plays the role with such aplomb that he redeems many a flagging scene. Kutcher, on the other hand, hasn't made a single good career decision since signing onto ""That 70s Show,"" and this isn't going to break the trend. In ""Guess Who,"" he is bland. Very bland. Bland bland bland. Forget white -- he's white bread.""Guess Who"" won't keep you guessing -- this lame comedy is strictly by the numbers. It has the occasional moments of excellence, but besides Mac's performance, it's a bomb that probably has Poitier rolling his eyes.",2,Guess who?

911026,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0009RCPUW,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","To say this movie is not as bad as I was anticipating is actually my way of complimenting director Kevin Rodney Sullivan for his patently inoffensive, occasionally perceptive update of 1967's ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"". Whereas Stanley Kramer's earlier film is often lambasted for deifying its principal character, the esteemed, tragically widowed black doctor portrayed by Sidney Poitier, the race-reversed 2005 film goes the opposite route by making its protagonist, a self-absorbed Wall Street trader named Simon Green, a morally flawed, buffoonish romantic.The conceit of the switch is fine, but the execution is simply not as gutsy as the concept. Consequently it is useless to make any further comparisons between the movies as the former was written as a 1960's social statement at the height of the civil rights movement, while the latter feels like race is being used as a generic plot device for a series of soft-hearted comedy bits similar to those in the ""Meet the Parents/Fockers"" movies. The threadbare plot focuses on Simon, the upwardly mobile boyfriend of Theresa, a free-spirited photographer. Of course, he's white, she's black and they travel to New Jersey to meet her parents, Percy and Marilyn Jones, who are planning a celebration around their 25th anniversary and - color me surprised - don't know Simon is white.What happens thereafter until the inevitable conclusion is relatively inconsequential, as most of the comedy is predictably derivative - the mistaken identity greeting; Percy and Simon having to share a bed (a pale rip-off of the much funnier ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles""); the testosterone-driven go-kart competition gone awry; a sexually questionable party organizer that recalls Martin Short's loopier turn in ""Father of the Bride""; the male-bonding all-nighter between Simon and Percy; and a hen-party of men-bashing women cackling and giving poor advice to Theresa and Marilyn (shades of ""Waiting to Exhale"").An hour into the film, there is a surprisingly provocative dinner scene in which Simon tells a succession of ""black jokes"" at Percy's goading until he inevitably crosses the line to offensiveness. If the rest of the film maintained the edginess of that moment, it could have gained some much-needed resonance. But instead of a thoughtful look at contemporary racism, we have a ""fish out of water"" story that flows downstream. Yet, the movie somehow manages a genuine sense of goodwill by the end, for example, there is a subtle moment when Theresa explains Simon's work situation in surprising detail to her father and then catches herself caring about him before going further.Bernie Mac plays Percy with his trademark comic bluster - hilariously brilliant on TV but here rather constrained by the conventions of his character and the weak-willed script. The female performances help the proceedings considerably - Zoe Saldana is refreshing as Theresa, exuding a Thandie Newton-like quality of dewiness but with greater verve; Judith Scott makes Marilyn the ideal wife and mother - sexy, no-nonsense and sympathetic; and Kellee Stewart makes her moments count as sassy little sister Keisha (she delivers the movie's best line when she first sees Simon: ""Oh my God, are we being audited?""). Unfortunately, like Adam Sandler and Ben Affleck, Ashton Kutcher is part of a generation of actors who suffer from a lack of dramatic gravitas. Although likeable at times, he lacks sufficient depth and texture to carry a movie with a social message, even one as watered-down as the one presented here.The DVD is a fairly standard package that includes Sullivan's thoughtful commentary on an alternate track and a making-of featurette that reflects the actors' vaunted opinions of the movie's intended social message. There are a handful of deleted scenes, which honestly seem as good as what is left in the movie, as well as a disposable goof reel. There are also an inordinate number of previews included, including one for the upcoming film adaptation of ""Rent"" which actually got me excited.",3,Watered-Down Comedy Has Warmth But Lacks Genuine Relevance,1123286400,"08 6, 2005",2005,4044,"['say', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'was', 'anticipating', 'actually', 'way', 'complimenting', 'director', 'Kevin', 'Rodney', 'Sullivan', 'patently', 'inoffensive', 'occasionally', 'perceptive', 'update', '1967', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'Whereas', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'earlier', 'film', 'often', 'lambasted', 'deifying', 'principal', 'character', 'esteemed', 'tragically', 'widowed', 'black', 'doctor', 'portrayed', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'race-reversed', '2005', 'film', 'opposite', 'route', 'making', 'protagonist', 'self-absorbed', 'Wall', 'Street', 'trader', 'named', 'Simon', 'Green', 'morally', 'flawed', 'buffoonish', 'romantic.The', 'conceit', 'switch', 'fine', 'execution', 'simply', 'not', 'as', 'gutsy', 'concept', 'Consequently', 'useless', 'make', 'further', 'comparisons', 'movies', 'former', 'was', 'written', '1960', 'social', 'statement', 'height', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'latter', 'feels', 'race', 'being', 'used', 'generic', 'plot', 'device', 'series', 'soft-hearted', 'comedy', 'bits', 'similar', 'Meet', 'Parents/Fockers', 'movies', 'threadbare', 'plot', 'Simon', 'upwardly', 'mobile', 'boyfriend', 'Theresa', 'free-spirited', 'photographer', 'course', 'white', 'black', 'travel', 'New', 'Jersey', 'meet', 'parents', 'Percy', 'Marilyn', 'Jones', 'who', 'are', 'planning', 'celebration', '25th', 'anniversary', 'color', 'surprised', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Simon', 'white.What', 'thereafter', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'relatively', 'inconsequential', 'most', 'comedy', 'predictably', 'derivative', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'greeting', 'Percy', 'Simon', 'having', 'share', 'bed', 'pale', 'rip-off', 'much', 'funnier', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'testosterone-driven', 'go-kart', 'competition', 'gone', 'awry', 'sexually', 'questionable', 'party', 'organizer', 'Martin', 'Short', 'loopier', 'turn', 'Father', 'Bride', 'male-bonding', 'all-nighter', 'Simon', 'Percy', 'hen-party', 'men-bashing', 'women', 'cackling', 'giving', 'poor', 'advice', 'Theresa', 'Marilyn', 'shades', 'Waiting', 'Exhale', '.An', 'hour', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'provocative', 'dinner', 'scene', 'Simon', 'succession', 'black', 'jokes', 'Percy', 'goading', 'inevitably', 'line', 'offensiveness', 'rest', 'film', 'maintained', 'edginess', 'moment', 'could', 'have', 'gained', 'much-needed', 'resonance', 'instead', 'thoughtful', 'look', 'contemporary', 'racism', 'have', 'fish', 'water', 'story', 'downstream', 'movie', 'somehow', 'genuine', 'sense', 'goodwill', 'end', 'example', 'subtle', 'moment', 'when', 'Theresa', 'Simon', 'work', 'situation', 'surprising', 'detail', 'father', 'then', 'catches', 'caring', 'going', 'further.Bernie', 'Mac', 'Percy', 'trademark', 'comic', 'bluster', 'hilariously', 'brilliant', 'TV', 'here', 'rather', 'constrained', 'conventions', 'character', 'weak-willed', 'script', 'female', 'performances', 'help', 'proceedings', 'considerably', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'refreshing', 'Theresa', 'exuding', 'Thandie', 'Newton-like', 'quality', 'dewiness', 'greater', 'verve', 'Judith', 'Scott', 'Marilyn', 'ideal', 'wife', 'mother', 'sexy', 'no-nonsense', 'sympathetic', 'Kellee', 'Stewart', 'moments', 'count', 'sassy', 'little', 'sister', 'Keisha', 'movie', 'best', 'line', 'when', 'first', 'Simon', 'Oh', 'God', 'are', 'being', 'audited', 'Unfortunately', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'part', 'generation', 'actors', 'who', 'suffer', 'lack', 'dramatic', 'gravitas', 'likeable', 'times', 'sufficient', 'depth', 'texture', 'carry', 'movie', 'social', 'message', 'even', 'one', 'as', 'watered-down', 'one', 'presented', 'here.The', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'standard', 'package', 'Sullivan', 'thoughtful', 'commentary', 'alternate', 'track', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'actors', 'vaunted', 'opinions', 'movie', 'intended', 'social', 'message', 'are', 'handful', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'honestly', 'seem', 'as', 'good', 'what', 'left', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'disposable', 'goof', 'reel', 'are', 'also', 'inordinate', 'number', 'previews', 'included', 'including', 'one', 'upcoming', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Rent', 'actually', 'got', 'excited']",N/A

This time around the proverbial shoe is on the other foot as Ashton Kutcher (a.k.a. Simon Green) tries to finagle his way into the hearts of the Percy Jones Family; patriarch by Mr. Bernie Mac.Simon Green is an upwardly mobile individual, full of potential and possessing the two things that Percy Jones demands in potential suitors for his daughter: (1) an excellent credit report, and (2) a job. Of course, after meeting Simon, Percy realizes that he might have a third requirement. However, unbeknownst to everyone involved, Simon has just quit his job. Simon has joined his fianc&eacute;e, Theresa, on her parent's 25th wedding anniversary; they are planning to use this event to announce their own engagement.Percy Jones resides in an upper income neighborhood, and wants nothing but the best for the little girl. Although, the sight of his future son-in-law does take him back. As in the first film, the mothers are easier to win over. However, Percy is skeptical to say the least. After some very embarrassing circumstances, both Percy and Simon are left without their significant other; this provides the perfect opportunity for them to get to know one another. After a long heart-to-heart conversation, Percy realizes that Simon, though jobless, does love his daughter.The events that follow are corny, but comical. I did enjoy this film.

911047,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B0009RCPUW,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 3]","""Guess Who"" is a two-headed beast.  It's a decent buddy comedy featuring an over-protective father and his goofy, soon-to-be son-in-law.  It's also a mild and somewhat boring romantic comedy.  When the primary characters, Percy Jones(Bernie Mac) and Simon Green(Ashton Kutcher), interact with each other, the film manages to conjure some solid laughs from the viewer.  But when Kutcher and Mac attempt to be romantic with their respective female leads, this flick falls apart.Taking it's main plotline from ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner,"" this film manages to give the viewer a role-reversal in race relations.  I have to admit that it was nice to see the white guy on the receiving end of prejudice in a film.  Remember folks, racists aren't always white.  Mac's character pushes this particular matter to a head at the dinner table, where he makes Kutcher tell some black jokes.  At first, the jokes are relatively tame, cute even, but one joke in particular nudges Mac over the edge, and I personally believe that his reaction was uncalled for in the situation.  To be honest, I've heard plenty of other black jokes that could send anybody, no matter what their color, reeling with anger or embarassment, depending on which end of the spectrum you are on.  The particular joke that Kutcher tells is offensive, but it is no more offensive than any of the previous jokes that he tells.  He is made out to be the bad man, even though he was simply giving Mac what he wanted.As stated before, the film falls flat when romance is thrown into the equation.  Had this film stuck with the buddy comedy routine, it probably would have been much better.  Bernie Mac is much funnier than Percy Jones allows him to be, and Kutcher is just too much of a dolt to be a believable successful and sweet guy.Mildly recommended, though there are much better comedies out there right now.",3,"Reasonably Funny, But The Romance Angle Drags It Down",1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,1871,"['Guess', 'Who', 'two-headed', 'beast', 'decent', 'buddy', 'comedy', 'featuring', 'over-protective', 'father', 'goofy', 'soon-to-be', 'son-in-law', 'also', 'mild', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'When', 'primary', 'characters', 'Percy', 'Jones', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Simon', 'Green', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'interact', 'other', 'film', 'conjure', 'solid', 'laughs', 'viewer', 'when', 'Kutcher', 'Mac', 'attempt', 'be', 'romantic', 'respective', 'female', 'flick', 'apart.Taking', 'main', 'plotline', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'film', 'give', 'viewer', 'role-reversal', 'race', 'relations', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'white', 'guy', 'receiving', 'end', 'prejudice', 'film', 'Remember', 'folks', 'racists', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'white', 'Mac', 'character', 'particular', 'matter', 'head', 'dinner', 'table', 'where', 'Kutcher', 'tell', 'black', 'jokes', 'first', 'jokes', 'are', 'relatively', 'tame', 'cute', 'even', 'one', 'joke', 'particular', 'nudges', 'Mac', 'edge', 'personally', 'believe', 'reaction', 'was', 'uncalled', 'situation', 'be', 'honest', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'plenty', 'other', 'black', 'jokes', 'could', 'send', 'anybody', 'matter', 'what', 'color', 'reeling', 'anger', 'embarassment', 'depending', 'end', 'spectrum', 'are', 'particular', 'joke', 'Kutcher', 'offensive', 'more', 'offensive', 'previous', 'jokes', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'bad', 'man', 'even', 'was', 'simply', 'giving', 'Mac', 'what', 'wanted.As', 'stated', 'film', 'flat', 'when', 'romance', 'thrown', 'equation', 'Had', 'film', 'stuck', 'buddy', 'comedy', 'routine', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'much', 'funnier', 'Percy', 'Jones', 'be', 'Kutcher', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'dolt', 'be', 'believable', 'successful', 'sweet', 'guy.Mildly', 'recommended', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'comedies', 'there', 'right', 'now']",N/A

It is time for the Caucasian, Simon Green (Ashton Kutcher), to visit his future African-American family-in-law for the first time.  Much has changed since 1967 when Sidney Poitier visited Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, yet some of the racial tensions still linger within the society.  Kevin Rodney Sullivan, who some recognize from How Stella Got Her Groove Back (1998), decides to bring comic relief into these racial tensions.The stress of visiting ones future father-in-law can be overwhelming.  On top of this stress, Simon quits his prestigious job at the investment firm JP Oliver, an obvious allusion towards JP Morgan.  In addition, Simon does not inform his fianc&eacute;e Theresa Jones (Zoe Saldana) about his recent unemployment while they plan on telling her parents about their engagement at the parents 25th Wedding Anniversary.  Simon manages the situation very well, a sign that he has a very high stress level.  However, his stress level is about to be tested when he is about to meet Theresa's overly protective father, Percy Jones (Bernie Mac), for the first time.Meanwhile, Percy checks out Simon's credit history, as he is a bank loan officer, and this impresses him.  Percy is also excited about Simon working at JP Oliver, but does not know that he has quit. Bernie Mac, who often comes across a grand character, does a good job here down-playing his strong persona.  This helps the film deliver a better cinematic experience, as the focus is on all the members of the family.The first encounter between Simon and Percy is a scene with mixed identities, which will certainly bring the audience to laughter.  The film continues to play with situational comedy that seems familiar with the comedy on many sitcoms.  Nonetheless, there are moments when the comedy actually elevates beyond sitcom level, and even brings a tear to the eye.  It is important that the audience does not forget the power of laughter, as it can help bring people together.  Sullivan does exactly this with Guess Who where he lets the comedy do the talking while presenting the racial issues.There are several situations in the film where Sullivan presents interesting notions in regards to human differences such as in the cab on the way to Theresa's parents and the night when they have supper together with Theresa's grandfather.  These situations deliver numerous opportunities to further extend to the racial tensions within the society.

911053,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0009RCPUW,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 0]","Granted, it would be easy to dismiss ""Guess Who"" as a tacky flip of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?""  But then no one needs to tell Bernie Mac that he is no Spencer Tracy anymore than the difference had to be brought to Steve Martin's attention when he remade ""Father of the Bride.""  Since he quits his job two minutes into the film Ashton Kutcher's character is not going to be mistaken for the one played by Sidney Poitier, but then the race of Kutcher's character is not held against him.  Judith Scott is not trying to compare to Katharine Hepburn and definitely makes her own impression, but the most fortunate cast member has to be Zo Salda&ntilde;a who was never going to be hurt by comparisons to Katharine Houghton.  More importantly, her character makes the best impression of the bunch, and while this 2005 comedy is about an African-American father trying to deal with the fact his daughter wants to marry a ""white boy,"" do not forget that the viewing audience also has to approve of the couple as well.  Fortunately, Theresa Jones is as much of a catch as her mother, Marilyn, and that at least gives Simon Green and Percy Jones something to agree about--eventually.Director Kevin Rodney Sullivan (""How Stella Got Her Groove Back "") comments that while race is the hook of ""Guess Who,"" that love is the melody.  He is right, and that is what saves this film from turning into a regrettable remake.  The trailer emphasizes the go-cart race between Percy and Simon, but while that seen provides laughs it is relatively unimportant to the central dynamic of the film (just as the cross-dressing scene is unnecessary to add to the inherent tension of the situation).  Yes, Percy is put off that Theresa did not say she was bringing home a white boy, but Percy clearly is not going to be happy with anybody who wants to sleep under his roof and try to sneak around and do who knows exactly what in the middle of the night.  Plus Percy knows that Simon is hiding some things and lying is not a question of race.The screenplay by David Ronn & Jay Scherick and Peter Tolan has a couple of things going for it that allows ""Guess Who"" to move beyond its 1967 ancestor.  First, we are given scenes establishing Simon and Theresa as a couple in love before they show up on daddy's doorstep.  Simon also gets to articulate exactly why he would love someone with whom he clearly has nothing in common.  Consequently, we totally buy the relationship, which has been going on for months and is not something that sprung up during a short vacation.  Second, the reason Theresa has dragged Simon home is because her parents are celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary with a renewal of their vows.  That means Percy has other headaches besides Theresa's boyfriend, and one of the best scenes comes in the film when the boys have each stepped over the line and Marilyn goes to her sister's house, dragging Theresa along, for lots of drinks with her wonderful support group.Most importantly, the best humor in ""Guess Who"" comes from the characters and not their race.  Obviously the key dynamic is between Mac and Kutcher, but Mac has strong rapports with Scott and Salda&ntilde;a as well, which is the respect in which this film is most like ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"" (where Houghton had the advantage of being Hepburn's niece).  The shift from friction to family is predictable in films such as this, but that does not stop it from being effective because I buy the characters and have no trouble rooting for all four of them to reach the requisite happy ending.  In the final analysis, while inspired by an earlier film, ""Guess Who"" carves out its own path and becomes an enjoyable comedy; that is to say, I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would going in, and that is a pleasant surprise given how disappointing so many movies are where the trailer is better than the film.  I am happy to report that is decidedly not the case here.Final note: My most serious quibble with the script comes in the dinner scene where Percy pushes Simon into telling racial jokes.  While the first few jokes are perfect for the situation, I really think that the inevitable point where Simon goes too far is one joke earlier than when the film thinks that it is (and in the joke that goes too far the third part does not fit the other two, plus is obviously untrue just on the basis of the people sitting in the room, so that it is as stupid as it is racist).  Fortunately it is the telling of the jokes and not the jokes themselves that are the point of the scene, so this remains a quibble and not a cause for the reading of the riot act.",4,A remake/reversal  that finds its own ground to stand on,1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,4632,"['Granted', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'Guess', 'Who', 'tacky', 'flip', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'then', 'one', 'tell', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'anymore', 'difference', 'had', 'be', 'brought', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'attention', 'when', 'remade', 'Father', 'Bride', 'job', 'two', 'minutes', 'film', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'character', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'mistaken', 'one', 'played', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'then', 'race', 'Kutcher', 'character', 'not', 'held', 'Judith', 'Scott', 'not', 'trying', 'compare', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'definitely', 'own', 'impression', 'most', 'fortunate', 'cast', 'member', 'be', 'Zo', 'Salda', 'ntilde', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'hurt', 'comparisons', 'Katharine', 'Houghton', 'More', 'importantly', 'character', 'best', 'impression', 'bunch', '2005', 'comedy', 'African-American', 'father', 'trying', 'deal', 'fact', 'daughter', 'marry', 'white', 'boy', 'do', 'not', 'forget', 'viewing', 'audience', 'also', 'approve', 'couple', 'as', 'well', 'Fortunately', 'Theresa', 'Jones', 'as', 'much', 'catch', 'mother', 'Marilyn', 'least', 'Simon', 'Green', 'Percy', 'Jones', 'something', 'agree', 'eventually.Director', 'Kevin', 'Rodney', 'Sullivan', 'How', 'Stella', 'Got', 'Her', 'Groove', 'Back', 'comments', 'race', 'hook', 'Guess', 'Who', 'love', 'melody', 'right', 'what', 'film', 'turning', 'regrettable', 'remake', 'trailer', 'go-cart', 'race', 'Percy', 'Simon', 'seen', 'relatively', 'unimportant', 'central', 'dynamic', 'film', 'just', 'cross-dressing', 'scene', 'unnecessary', 'add', 'inherent', 'tension', 'situation', 'Yes', 'Percy', 'put', 'off', 'Theresa', 'did', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'bringing', 'home', 'white', 'boy', 'Percy', 'clearly', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'happy', 'anybody', 'who', 'sleep', 'roof', 'try', 'sneak', 'do', 'who', 'exactly', 'what', 'middle', 'night', 'Percy', 'Simon', 'hiding', 'things', 'lying', 'not', 'question', 'race.The', 'screenplay', 'David', 'Ronn', 'Jay', 'Scherick', 'Peter', 'Tolan', 'couple', 'things', 'going', 'Guess', 'Who', 'move', '1967', 'ancestor', 'First', 'are', 'given', 'scenes', 'establishing', 'Simon', 'Theresa', 'couple', 'love', 'show', 'up', 'daddy', 'doorstep', 'Simon', 'also', 'articulate', 'exactly', 'why', 'would', 'love', 'someone', 'whom', 'clearly', 'nothing', 'common', 'Consequently', 'totally', 'buy', 'relationship', 'been', 'going', 'months', 'not', 'something', 'sprung', 'up', 'short', 'vacation', 'Second', 'reason', 'Theresa', 'dragged', 'Simon', 'home', 'parents', 'are', 'celebrating', '25th', 'wedding', 'anniversary', 'renewal', 'vows', 'Percy', 'other', 'headaches', 'Theresa', 'boyfriend', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'when', 'boys', 'have', 'stepped', 'line', 'Marilyn', 'sister', 'house', 'dragging', 'Theresa', 'along', 'lots', 'drinks', 'wonderful', 'support', 'group.Most', 'importantly', 'best', 'humor', 'Guess', 'Who', 'characters', 'not', 'race', 'Obviously', 'key', 'dynamic', 'Mac', 'Kutcher', 'Mac', 'strong', 'rapports', 'Scott', 'Salda', 'ntilde', 'as', 'well', 'respect', 'film', 'most', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'where', 'Houghton', 'had', 'advantage', 'being', 'Hepburn', 'niece', 'shift', 'friction', 'family', 'predictable', 'films', 'such', 'not', 'stop', 'being', 'effective', 'buy', 'characters', 'have', 'trouble', 'rooting', 'four', 'reach', 'requisite', 'happy', 'ending', 'final', 'analysis', 'inspired', 'earlier', 'film', 'Guess', 'Who', 'out', 'own', 'path', 'enjoyable', 'comedy', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'going', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'given', 'how', 'disappointing', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'are', 'where', 'trailer', 'better', 'film', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'decidedly', 'not', 'case', 'here.Final', 'note', 'most', 'serious', 'quibble', 'script', 'dinner', 'scene', 'where', 'Percy', 'Simon', 'telling', 'racial', 'jokes', 'first', 'few', 'jokes', 'are', 'perfect', 'situation', 'really', 'think', 'inevitable', 'point', 'where', 'Simon', 'too', 'far', 'one', 'joke', 'earlier', 'when', 'film', 'joke', 'too', 'far', 'third', 'part', 'not', 'fit', 'other', 'two', 'obviously', 'untrue', 'just', 'basis', 'people', 'sitting', 'room', 'as', 'stupid', 'racist', 'Fortunately', 'telling', 'jokes', 'not', 'jokes', 'are', 'point', 'scene', 'quibble', 'not', 'cause', 'reading', 'riot', 'act']",N/A

After being a pleasantly unexpected rental, I was looking forward to watching it. I just did not like it. It was shockingly slow, and my boyfriend kept laughing at stuff that I just couldn't understand what so funny about them. I think I laughed once throughout the whole film, and I don't remember what I laughed at now.I do have a bit of a thing for Ashton Kutcher, but he's way too much of a pretty boy for my liking. He was gorgeous in Butterfly Effect - I disagree with the other reviewer who said that Ashton Kutcher has never made a good career decision, have you seen that film?! (And at an estimated cost of $100,000, digital effects were used to remove Ashton Kutcher's red Kaballah bracelet in every scene in which he appeared. How dumb, rip it off his wrist!) I think it's the whole bearded thing that does it for me, and unkempt hair. (Mind you, beards may be sexy, but stubble rash plays havoc with your skin. But it's worth it.)Bernie Mac was desperately trying to save this film it felt, but it just wasn't happening. And his eyes, boy oh boy, did they gave me the heebie-jeebies. Talk about popping out his head! The rest of the cast seemed to be going through the motions. The lovely Zoe Saldana (also in Get Over It, Pirates Of The Caribbean, and The Terminal) was this film's one saving grace, but even then she seemed to disappear into the background. And the rest of her family, and sister (excluding her mum) played very stereotypical black women that wouldn't be out of place on a Jerry Springer show.I haven't seen Meet The Parents, which has been compared a lot to Guess Who - although apparently better.

In fact, this was a complete rip-off of ""Meet the Parents"" to degree that really surprised me.  The writer of ""Meet the Parents"" should ask for some royalties from ""Guess Who"".  Here are some of the similarities:1) A boyfriend is coming to his girlfriend's parents home and plans to announce an engagement.2) The father immediately dislikes the boyfriend and immediately begins trying to intimidate him.3) The boyfriend begins spinning lies about his past to the parents.4)  The father suspects the lies and dislikes the boyfriend even more.5)  The father discovers something suggesting disturbing sexual practices by the boyfriend.6)  The father is determined to keep the boyfriend from sleeping with his daughter.7)  A wedding (or renewing of vows) is being planned to occur in the parents BACKYARD.8)  Lies are discovered and the boyfriend is driven from the home.  He heads home via a train or a plane.9)  For no apparent reason, the father suddenly changes his mind about the boyfriend and rushes to the train station (airport), where he talks the boyfriend into returning.The racial situations are just for window dressing to throw a smokescreen over the obvious plagerism.Having said all of the above, if plagerism doesn't bother you, you will find a few funny scenes, but nothing special.  Don't expect any significant commentary on race relations in America or any other deeper message.  This is the type of film that is only worth seeing if you can't find anything else that's interesting.  I guess I'm saying that it is better than staring at a blank TV screen and is not terrible, but it's just very average.Ashton Kutcher gives a ""C"" performance and just isn't all that funny.

911081,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0009RCPUW,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 2]","**1/2When it was released in 1967, ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" was acclaimed as a ""breakthrough"" film for its lighthearted, yet serious, depiction of an interracial romance.  In the years since, society has moved so far in the direction of acceptance of so-called ""mixed marriages"" that any remake is bound to feel, at least to some extent, superfluous and anachronistic.  And that is exactly the case with ""Guess Who,"" a 2005 update whose abbreviated title is only the first of the many changes the filmmakers have rung on the Stanley Kramer original.The screenwriters' first alteration involves switching the race roles, so that it is now a black family having to accept a white male as a prospective in-law rather than the other way around.  Bernie Mac assumes the Spencer Tracy role as the father whose world is turned upside down when his beloved daughter brings a Caucasian boyfriend (Ashton Kutcher as a white Sidney Poitier) home to meet the family.  On the distaff side, we have Judith Scott taking over for Katherine Hepburn as the understanding mother and Zoe Saldana replacing Katherine Houghton as the freethinking daughter.Since interracial marriage is no longer the hot-button issue it once was, the filmmakers have been forced to inject a number of other non-race-related plot complications into the mix to develop and maintain the conflict and drama.  Thus, we have Kutcher trying to hide the fact from both his fiance and her family that he has recently quit his high-paying job at a prestigious firm and that he may, in fact, be the target of a securities-and-exchange commission probe.  Indeed, with Kutcher spending most of his time trying to win over his critical and overbearing future father-in-law, ""Guess Who"" feels more like a remake of ""Meet the Parents"" than of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.""The real problem with ""Guess Who"" is that it rarely has the courage of its convictions.  Having decided to tackle a relatively dicey topic, the film too often drops the issue in favor of scenes that wouldn't pass muster even on a third-rate sitcom.  For every scene that is incisive and daring - i.e. Kutcher telling a series of black jokes at the family dinner table - there is another that is pure Hollywood hokum (Mac and Kutcher sleeping in the same bed together, Mac and Kutcher having a go-cart race to determine who has the higher testosterone level and the greater machismo, etc.).All of the performers are fine, especially Mac and Kutcher in the lead roles.  However, they just haven`t been given very sophisticated material to work with here.  ""Guess Who"" might have been a better film had it aimed more for genuine, hard-edged satire and less for lowbrow slapstick and predictable romantic comedy sentimentality.Still, it's been 38 years since ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" first shocked the nation with its in-your-face defiance of miscegenation laws, and the world has since moved on to other issues of social injustice and marital definition.  Which is why, in the year 2005, ""Brokeback Mountain"" was a breakthrough film and ""Guess Who"" was not.",2,"""edgy"" comedy without the edge",1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,3085,"['**1/2When', 'was', 'released', '1967', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'was', 'acclaimed', 'breakthrough', 'film', 'lighthearted', 'yet', 'serious', 'depiction', 'interracial', 'romance', 'years', 'society', 'moved', 'so', 'far', 'direction', 'acceptance', 'so-called', 'mixed', 'marriages', 'remake', 'bound', 'feel', 'least', 'extent', 'superfluous', 'anachronistic', 'exactly', 'case', 'Guess', 'Who', '2005', 'update', 'abbreviated', 'title', 'only', 'first', 'many', 'changes', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'rung', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'screenwriters', 'first', 'alteration', 'switching', 'race', 'roles', 'now', 'black', 'family', 'having', 'accept', 'white', 'male', 'prospective', 'in-law', 'rather', 'other', 'way', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'role', 'father', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'beloved', 'daughter', 'Caucasian', 'boyfriend', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'white', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'home', 'meet', 'family', 'distaff', 'side', 'have', 'Judith', 'Scott', 'taking', 'over', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'understanding', 'mother', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'replacing', 'Katherine', 'Houghton', 'freethinking', 'daughter.Since', 'interracial', 'marriage', 'no', 'longer', 'hot-button', 'issue', 'once', 'was', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'been', 'forced', 'inject', 'number', 'other', 'non-race-related', 'plot', 'complications', 'mix', 'develop', 'maintain', 'conflict', 'drama', 'Thus', 'have', 'Kutcher', 'trying', 'hide', 'fact', 'fiance', 'family', 'recently', 'quit', 'high-paying', 'job', 'prestigious', 'firm', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'target', 'securities-and-exchange', 'commission', 'probe', 'Indeed', 'Kutcher', 'spending', 'most', 'time', 'trying', 'win', 'over', 'critical', 'overbearing', 'future', 'father-in-law', 'Guess', 'Who', 'more', 'remake', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'real', 'problem', 'Guess', 'Who', 'rarely', 'courage', 'convictions', 'Having', 'decided', 'tackle', 'relatively', 'dicey', 'topic', 'film', 'too', 'often', 'issue', 'favor', 'scenes', 'would', ""n't"", 'pass', 'muster', 'even', 'third-rate', 'sitcom', 'scene', 'incisive', 'daring', 'i.e', 'Kutcher', 'telling', 'series', 'black', 'jokes', 'family', 'dinner', 'table', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'hokum', 'Mac', 'Kutcher', 'sleeping', 'same', 'bed', 'together', 'Mac', 'Kutcher', 'having', 'go-cart', 'race', 'determine', 'who', 'higher', 'testosterone', 'level', 'greater', 'machismo', 'etc', '.All', 'performers', 'are', 'fine', 'especially', 'Mac', 'Kutcher', 'lead', 'roles', 'However', 'just', 'haven', 't', 'been', 'given', 'very', 'sophisticated', 'material', 'work', 'here', 'Guess', 'Who', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'aimed', 'more', 'genuine', 'hard-edged', 'satire', 'less', 'lowbrow', 'slapstick', 'predictable', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'sentimentality.Still', 'been', '38', 'years', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'first', 'shocked', 'nation', 'in-your-face', 'defiance', 'miscegenation', 'laws', 'world', 'moved', 'other', 'issues', 'social', 'injustice', 'marital', 'definition', 'Which', 'why', 'year', '2005', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'was', 'breakthrough', 'film', 'Guess', 'Who', 'was', 'not']",N/A

I didn't know it was a spin-off,  nor did I care. But I really like Ashton Kutcher (love brothas, but this is one white man I'd give a chance! Mmph!) and I think he's a great actor.  Bernie Mac makes me nervous though. As a stand-up comic, he's tear jerking funny, but as an actor, I never enjoyed him.

So...I went to see the movie.I was blown away. This movie really did have a great plot.  A young, white man (Ashton) quits his job right before he goes to meet the in-laws.  His girlfriend (""Drumline"" actress Zoe Saldana) hasn't mentioned to her parents that her boyfriend (and secret fiancee) is white, Ashton hasn't mentioned he's now unemployed, and Bernie hasn't...well, Bernie is the crazy, overprotective, hilarious father that we would expect him to be.  I was pleased that his wife wasn't overshadowed in the movie the way I expected her to be, with them redoing their vows and having a second wedding ceremony.Viewers get to see their ultra-entertaining renewal of the vows, Bernie and Ashton try to vibe as father and daughter's boyfriend, black and white culture clashes and similarities, and family comfort.

team.But Some boring drawn out scenes hurt the flow of this movie and hurts it overall.The Plot-""Guess who"" is about a white man named Simon(Kutcher) who works on Wall street and has a black girlfriend named teresa and the couple go to her fathers (who is named Percy(bernie mac) house and spend the weekend because he is renewing his marraige vows with his wife.Little does simon know that Percy is a strict man and tries to discourage simon in various ways while he is at his house and tries to make him look like a liar who is racist.Positives-This movie does have some funny scenes.Here is a look at some-The first meeting between Simon and percy is when Simon and his girlfriend pull up to her fathers driveway and Percy thinks that the Black Taxi cab driver is her boyfriend and Percy makes simon look stupid by telling him ""UHM Sir you can drop the bags inside the livingroom""-Simon and his girlfriend are in the bedroom and simon gets the urge to play around with her red lingerie and he puts it on, gets on his knees on the bed and teresa tries to take it back and then Percy walks in on them.-Simon says he once drove for NASCAR which is a lie and Percy challenges him to a Go-Cart Race which ends very funny.-While Simon is attending dinner with teresa's family Percy urges Simon to say black jokes which starts innocent enough but ends with Percy and his father offended.These are some of the funny scenes of the movie there are more but these are the highlights.Negatives-When the movie is not trying to be funny it's very sappy and annoying.-For example after Simon escapes from the basement(where he was sharing a bed with percy) he goes with teresa to a bridge and start to chat about their past relationships and how much they care for each other, Which lasts about 10 minutes...it's not funny and it feels filler and ruins the flow of the comedy.-percy's wife and simons girlfriend are mad at their men and go to a friends house, again we are hit with another 10 minute not funny scene with just the women chatting about how useless men are.These Scenes dearly mess up this movie and ruin the flow and no you don't get these scenes back to back you get one after a couple of funny scenes and that hurts the pacing of the film.The Ending is another negative of this film as it's been done hundreds and hundreds of times and is so cliche' it's annoying.conclusion-This film has some very funny scenes and again i will say that Mac and Kutcher play off each other very well but some long filler scenes hurt the flow of the movie and it's cliche'

Not so much the movie, as of the DVD itself.This GUESS WHO DVD opens with the usual time-stealers.First, the DVD steals our time by forcing us to sit through two promos before we can get to the main menu.  Then when we think we can finally see GUESS WHO, we're forced to sit through two WARNINGS not to infringe copyright, then two DISCLAIMERS about the audio commentary.Finally, I think I'm going to GUESS WHO.  Only, DVD manufacturing is so poor, the film skips and stalls fifty minutes into the film.  And I can't get to the main menu, because the DVD has disabled that feature.  You see the little stop sign in the corner of your TV as you attempt to return to the menu while watching the film.So I can't go to the menu to try and return to the scene again, to see if the DVD won't skip a second time.  I must remove the DVD and sit through the promos and warnings and disclaimers once again.I was unable to see GUESS WHO beyond fifty minutes.  Too bad, because it seemed an okay film.  But the quesion remains, why do SO MANY DVDs skip and stall?If DVDs are so fragile, why don't CDs and CD-ROMs have this problem?There was a theory in VIDEO magazine in the 1980s that the studios were releasing poor quality VHS tapes because they didn't want consumers to build longterm libraries.  That makes sense.Remember, the studios never wanted to sell their movies, they only wanted to rent tapes to video stores.  It was a series of court cases in the 1970s/80s concerning antitrust, restraint of trade, and fair use in copyright, (such as the Sony Betamax case) that barred the studios from restricting the trade of independent video stores.Yet the studios made a bundle when people built tape libraries.  Another bundle now that people are replacing their fragile tapes with fragile DVDs.I can see why the studios don't want to manufacture decent quality DVDs, lest consumers have permanent movies floating around for decades.  Studios earn nothing on the sale of used DVDs.  Better for them to manufacture fragile DVDs that won't last, so consumers will more easily replace their scratchy DVDs when the next format comes along.I'm really tired of SO MANY rental DVDs skipping and stalling, and SO MANY DVDs having promos I can't bypass.  I wish there was more consumer outrage against these crappy studio practices.I'd give GUESS WHO three stars (based on the first 50 minutes) but must deduct for the (intentionally?) poor manufacturing.",1,poor DVD quality & time-stealing promos ruin a decent film,1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,2479,"['review', 'GUESS', 'WHO', 'DVD', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'DVD', 'itself.This', 'GUESS', 'WHO', 'DVD', 'usual', 'time-stealers.First', 'DVD', 'time', 'forcing', 'sit', 'two', 'promos', 'can', 'get', 'main', 'menu', 'Then', 'when', 'think', 'can', 'finally', 'see', 'GUESS', 'WHO', ""'re"", 'forced', 'sit', 'two', 'WARNINGS', 'not', 'infringe', 'copyright', 'then', 'two', 'DISCLAIMERS', 'audio', 'commentary.Finally', 'think', ""'m"", 'going', 'GUESS', 'WHO', 'Only', 'DVD', 'manufacturing', 'so', 'poor', 'film', 'skips', 'stalls', 'fifty', 'minutes', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'main', 'menu', 'DVD', 'disabled', 'feature', 'see', 'little', 'stop', 'sign', 'corner', 'TV', 'attempt', 'return', 'menu', 'watching', 'film.So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'menu', 'try', 'return', 'scene', 'again', 'see', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'skip', 'second', 'time', 'must', 'remove', 'DVD', 'sit', 'promos', 'warnings', 'disclaimers', 'once', 'again.I', 'was', 'unable', 'see', 'GUESS', 'WHO', 'fifty', 'minutes', 'Too', 'bad', 'seemed', 'okay', 'film', 'quesion', 'why', 'do', 'SO', 'MANY', 'DVDs', 'skip', 'stall', 'DVDs', 'are', 'so', 'fragile', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'CDs', 'CD-ROMs', 'have', 'problem', 'was', 'theory', 'VIDEO', 'magazine', '1980s', 'studios', 'were', 'releasing', 'poor', 'quality', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'consumers', 'build', 'longterm', 'libraries', 'sense.Remember', 'studios', 'never', 'wanted', 'sell', 'movies', 'only', 'wanted', 'rent', 'tapes', 'video', 'stores', 'was', 'series', 'court', 'cases', '1970s/80s', 'concerning', 'antitrust', 'restraint', 'trade', 'fair', 'use', 'copyright', 'such', 'Sony', 'Betamax', 'case', 'barred', 'studios', 'restricting', 'trade', 'independent', 'video', 'stores.Yet', 'studios', 'made', 'bundle', 'when', 'people', 'built', 'tape', 'libraries', 'bundle', 'now', 'people', 'are', 'replacing', 'fragile', 'tapes', 'fragile', 'DVDs.I', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'studios', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'manufacture', 'decent', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'lest', 'consumers', 'have', 'permanent', 'movies', 'floating', 'decades', 'Studios', 'earn', 'nothing', 'sale', 'used', 'DVDs', 'Better', 'manufacture', 'fragile', 'DVDs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'last', 'consumers', 'will', 'more', 'easily', 'replace', 'scratchy', 'DVDs', 'when', 'next', 'format', 'along.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'tired', 'SO', 'MANY', 'rental', 'DVDs', 'skipping', 'stalling', 'SO', 'MANY', 'DVDs', 'having', 'promos', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bypass', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'consumer', 'outrage', 'crappy', 'studio', 'practices.I', ""'d"", 'give', 'GUESS', 'WHO', 'three', 'stars', 'based', 'first', '50', 'minutes', 'must', 'deduct', 'intentionally', 'poor', 'manufacturing']",N/A
911099,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0009RCPUW,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 0]","Simon (Ashton Kutcher) and his girlfriend, Theresa (Zoe Saldana) are going to suburban New Jersey to meet her parents on the weekend of their 25th Anniversary. During the ride there, he learns that she hasn't told her father that he is white. Upon meeting her parents (Bernie Mac and Judith Scott), her father, Percy immediately takes a disliking to him. He doesn't trust him but insists it's not because he is white. Throughout the weekend, events escalate until no one is talking to anyone else and everyone has to look into their hearts and figure out why they love each other.""Guess Who"" is a strange project for Hollywood. Making remakes and `reinterpretations' is nothing new. Hollywood seems to dislike attempts to create anything new, preferring sequels and remakes. Many years ago, musicals were often made from dramas and comedies. Currently, a couple of films are being made of hit Broadway musicals based on comedies. But why make a comedy based on a drama from the late 60s, starring Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn and Sidney Poitier. Cutting edge for its time, ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"" is an interesting film, for the time, but now appears very dated. Presumably, the filmmakers were attracted to the thought of updating the material and mining it for laughs.The `updating' comes from switching the races of all characters. Instead of a white woman taking a black man home to meet her parents, a black woman takes a white man home to meet her parents. This is pretty much the extent of the filmmaker's attempts to update the material. Percy's family lives in a suburban home which could have been lifted out of the original drama. His values are pretty much from the late 60s as well. Before he meets Simon, Percy is excited because he does a credit report on the new boyfriend and learns that he works with a large stock brokerage and has a great future. When he first meets Simon, he doesn't like him because of the color of his skin. Simon and Theresa are given the more modern sensibilities. They are living in a modern loft, she's an artist, they talk a lot about their feelings. There is a single moment in which Theresa tells her father that she and Simon are frequently treated differently by other people. This is pretty much the only attempt to address the modern aspect of two people living in an interracial relationship.All of this would be excusable, I guess, if the film were extremely funny. Instead, the filmmakers seem intent on recycling situations from ""Meet The Parents"", but watering the down until they resemble something more like ""Father of The Bride"". Simon is nervous when he first meets Percy, so naturally he lies about sports. He concocts a ludicrous, and frankly strange, lie about working with Jeff Gordon and NASCAR drivers. You can probably guess where that joke will go. Simon quits his job the day before he goes to meet her parents. Again, you can probably guess where this will lead the action. Percy doesn't trust Simon, so he sleeps with him in a sofa bed in the basement.  Percy doesn't want to dance the tango with his wife at the ceremony and Simon's mom ran a dance studio. I wonder where that will go. The finale is also one of the most forced and contrived I have seen in some time.The filmmakers have relied on cheap sitcom laughs and situations, robbing the film of any depth and any laughs.""Guess Who"" is a mind-numbing diversion, suitable only if you have nothing else to do.",2,Guess What?

When his daughter Theresa brings her new boyfriend, Simon Green, home to meet Percy and his wife Marilyn, he is unaware that Simon has already proposed to Theresa and plans to announce the engagement at Percy and Marilyn's 25th anniversary party. As far as Percy's concerned, no man will ever be good enough for his baby girl and the long line of struggling-artist types Theresa has dated so far has only served to bolster his conviction. So that there are no unpleasant surprises this time around, Percy, a bank loan officer, runs a credit check on Simon. The young man, a successful stockbroker, certainly looks good on paper, and for the first time, Percy is actually looking forward to meeting one of his daughter's boyfriends. However, the young man he has envisioned--a dazzling combination of Denzel Washington, Colin Powell and Tiger Woods--is not who arrives at his doorstep. Percy is aghast and more than a little indignant when his daughter presents her decidedly Caucasian boyfriend. Once he is over his initial shock, Percy begins interrogating Simon about his family history, education, career, and favorite sports. Feeling pressured to impress his prospective father-in-law, Simon boasts of his (nonexistent) past as a NASCAR driver, which only serves to arouse Percy's suspicions. Regardless, Simon's repeated attempts to make a good impression are futile. Percy rebuffs him at every turn and makes it his mission to expose Simon as a fraud and undermine his daughter's new relationship. This movie goes down very smoothly. Its cast is appealing, its script is often clever and imaginative.",5,Guess Who,1262476800,"01 3, 2010",2010,1733,"['Percy', 'Jones', 'great', 'pride', 'knowledge', 'always', 'right', 'especially', 'when', 'welfare', 'family', 'When', 'daughter', 'Theresa', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Simon', 'Green', 'home', 'meet', 'Percy', 'wife', 'Marilyn', 'unaware', 'Simon', 'already', 'proposed', 'Theresa', 'announce', 'engagement', 'Percy', 'Marilyn', '25th', 'anniversary', 'party', 'As', 'far', 'Percy', 'concerned', 'man', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'baby', 'girl', 'long', 'line', 'struggling-artist', 'types', 'Theresa', 'dated', 'so', 'far', 'only', 'served', 'bolster', 'conviction', 'are', 'unpleasant', 'time', 'around', 'Percy', 'bank', 'loan', 'officer', 'credit', 'check', 'Simon', 'young', 'man', 'successful', 'stockbroker', 'certainly', 'good', 'paper', 'first', 'time', 'Percy', 'actually', 'looking', 'forward', 'meeting', 'one', 'daughter', 'boyfriends', 'However', 'young', 'man', 'envisioned', 'dazzling', 'combination', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Colin', 'Powell', 'Tiger', 'Woods', 'not', 'who', 'doorstep', 'Percy', 'aghast', 'more', 'little', 'indignant', 'when', 'daughter', 'decidedly', 'Caucasian', 'boyfriend', 'initial', 'shock', 'Percy', 'interrogating', 'Simon', 'family', 'history', 'education', 'career', 'favorite', 'sports', 'Feeling', 'pressured', 'impress', 'prospective', 'father-in-law', 'Simon', 'nonexistent', 'past', 'NASCAR', 'driver', 'only', 'arouse', 'Percy', 'suspicions', 'Regardless', 'Simon', 'repeated', 'attempts', 'make', 'good', 'impression', 'are', 'futile', 'Percy', 'rebuffs', 'turn', 'mission', 'expose', 'Simon', 'fraud', 'undermine', 'daughter', 'new', 'relationship', 'movie', 'down', 'very', 'smoothly', 'cast', 'appealing', 'script', 'often', 'clever', 'imaginative']",N/A
911103,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0009RCPUW,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","`Guess Who' is not going to make a bold statement about racial consciousness. It is not a Spike Lee film; it is a comedy starring Ashton Kutcher, and that tells you a thing or two about the nature of `Guess Who' a remake of the 1967 Stanley Kramer film. Though it is not very ambitious and original, `Guess Who' is still an amiable and pretty funny comedy with Kutcher, Zoe Saldana, and Bernie Mac. And you know, it is hard not to make a funny comedy with Bernie Mac in it.A nice and charming Afro-American girl Theresa brings her nice boyfriend Simon home to introduce him to her father Percy. Ashton Kutcher is the nice guy, and Zoe Saldana is the nice and charming girl. The film's story starts when always reliable Bernie Mac as Theresa's daddy comes to know that his daughter's boyfriend is a white. And Simon has to confess that he has recently quit (or lost, depending on your perspective) his job.Predictable? Yes, it is. Well, the filmmakers do know that, and they also know that interracial marriage alone is not enough to make a feature film these days. So they added several set-pieces that could be found in `Meet the Parents.' Those episodes are not especially original - like wild go-cart chase scenes between Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher revealing their rivalry - but they are well-acted and certainly funny. Kutcher is always good when doing goofy scenes, and Bernie Mac can be always hilarious without exaggerating his acting.At certain level, the film poses some questions as to the racial barriers between whites and blacks at the black family's dinner scene, in which Kutcher's white character tells racial jokes. The idea is interesting, but the film refuses to push the issue further, and its momentarily serious tone is soon dispersed by the following romantic/comedic mood. Some would find the film's attitudes weak and timid; others find it acceptable, thinking it just a comedy.Though it is not exactly the best comedy in 2005, `Guess Who' is still pleasing and likable comedy thanks to the capable cast. And any film with Bernie Mac is worth our time and money.",3,Just OK Comedy with (Typically) Goofy Ashton Kutcher and (Always) Funny Bernie Mac,1142035200,"03 11, 2006",2006,2090,"['Guess', 'Who', 'not', 'going', 'make', 'bold', 'statement', 'racial', 'consciousness', 'not', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'film', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'thing', 'two', 'nature', 'Guess', 'Who', ""'"", 'remake', '1967', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'ambitious', 'original', 'Guess', 'Who', 'still', 'amiable', 'pretty', 'funny', 'comedy', 'Kutcher', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'know', 'hard', 'not', 'make', 'funny', 'comedy', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'it.A', 'nice', 'charming', 'Afro-American', 'girl', 'Theresa', 'nice', 'boyfriend', 'Simon', 'home', 'introduce', 'father', 'Percy', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'nice', 'guy', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'nice', 'charming', 'girl', 'film', 'story', 'when', 'always', 'reliable', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Theresa', 'daddy', 'know', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'white', 'Simon', 'confess', 'recently', 'quit', 'lost', 'depending', 'perspective', 'job.Predictable', 'Yes', 'Well', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'know', 'also', 'know', 'interracial', 'marriage', 'alone', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'feature', 'film', 'days', 'added', 'several', 'set-pieces', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'especially', 'original', 'wild', 'go-cart', 'chase', 'scenes', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'revealing', 'rivalry', 'are', 'well-acted', 'certainly', 'funny', 'Kutcher', 'always', 'good', 'when', 'doing', 'goofy', 'scenes', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'can', 'be', 'always', 'hilarious', 'exaggerating', 'acting.At', 'certain', 'level', 'film', 'questions', 'racial', 'barriers', 'whites', 'blacks', 'black', 'family', 'dinner', 'scene', 'Kutcher', 'white', 'character', 'tells', 'racial', 'jokes', 'idea', 'interesting', 'film', 'push', 'issue', 'further', 'momentarily', 'serious', 'tone', 'soon', 'dispersed', 'following', 'romantic/comedic', 'mood', 'would', 'find', 'film', 'attitudes', 'weak', 'timid', 'others', 'find', 'acceptable', 'thinking', 'just', 'comedy.Though', 'not', 'exactly', 'best', 'comedy', '2005', 'Guess', 'Who', 'still', 'pleasing', 'likable', 'comedy', 'thanks', 'capable', 'cast', 'film', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'time', 'money']",N/A
