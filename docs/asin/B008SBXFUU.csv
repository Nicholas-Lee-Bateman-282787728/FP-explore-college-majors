1575578,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B008SBXFUU,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[1, 1]","This is the 2011 video of COMPANY, the 1970 Stephen Sondheim musical that on its premiere seemed to many too harsh in its satire of the upper-middle-class thatergoers who formed the core of Broadway's audience (yet went on to win a Tony).  In the intervening fortysome years, through the staying power of its numerous classic songs and a liberalization of what constitutes the ""Broadway Musical,"" COMPANY has become a frequent candidate for local theatrical revivals, concert performances, and big-name reprises like this one.  An eclectic cast was assembled, a surprising number from television, including Christina Hendricks, Stephen Colbert, and Jon Cryer, as well as the more expected Broadway veterans like Martha Plimpton, Craig Bierko and Patti LuPone.  Everyone who knows Sondheim's music has at least a couple of favorite songs from this show, including ""The Little Things You Do Together,"" ""Sorry-Grateful,"" ""Barcelona,"" and ""Marry Me a Little.""  As you might expect, LuPone's savage rendition of ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" was so good it may bring this song so closely linked to Elaine Strich to a new generation.  The very loudest audience cheers, though, went to Katie Finneran for her assured performance of ""Getting Married Today,"" a cross between an extremely chewy and fast-paced patter routine and the kind of personality-breakdown song Sondheim likes (""Mama's Turn"" from GYPSY; ""Live, Laugh, Love"" from FOLLIES).  Finneran maintained grace and humor while advancing the plot and proclaiming herself a candidate for Bellevue, and doing it at breakneck speed.  All in all, though, the consummate performer of the bunch has to be Neil Patrick Harris, who as the much put-upon unmarried Bobby is the center of the show and has the biggest demands made of him in terms of emotional singing and wide-ranging acting.  Is Harris a ""singer who can act"" or an ""actor who can sing""?  Truth be told, he can do anything.Why am I giving this only four stars?  Not for the material or the generally excellent performances, but to borrow a Sondheim-ism ""God is in the details"" and a couple of aspects of this show's presentation seemed to me less than heavenly.  The show was performed at Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall, with the beautifully rich New York Philharmonic behind the show, making for a wide, shallow performance space for the acting of this play with musicians ever in the background.  While camerawork, sound and editing were all anyone could ask for, the audience brought its hometown expectations to the performance, as well, sometimes applauding out of turn or applauding thunderously before a song was quite over.  Fisher Hall is a grand performance space, but these breaches in normal proscenium-stage mode and decorum gave it the feel of a well-upholstered civic center and the DVD the feel of a PBS tribute.  Moreover, the tiny flyer that came in the DVD box offered no real information about the cast other than a little back-patting about how some of its members adjusted their schedules for this one-time offering.  Nonetheless, no Sondheim fan or student of the Broadway musical should miss this version of COMPANY, which was presented with its vintage humor and hairstyles quite intact.  For those who were disappointed by the excerpted, 90-minutes-long 1986 FOLLIES, this COMPANY is played full-out and runs two hours, 25 minutes.",4,Eclectic cast provides bright transcription of classic Sondheim musical,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,3360,"['2011', 'video', 'COMPANY', '1970', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'musical', 'premiere', 'seemed', 'many', 'too', 'harsh', 'satire', 'upper-middle-class', 'thatergoers', 'who', 'formed', 'core', 'Broadway', 'audience', 'yet', 'went', 'win', 'Tony', 'intervening', 'fortysome', 'years', 'staying', 'power', 'numerous', 'classic', 'songs', 'liberalization', 'what', 'Broadway', 'Musical', 'COMPANY', 'become', 'frequent', 'candidate', 'local', 'theatrical', 'revivals', 'concert', 'performances', 'big-name', 'reprises', 'one', 'eclectic', 'cast', 'was', 'assembled', 'surprising', 'number', 'television', 'including', 'Christina', 'Hendricks', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'Jon', 'Cryer', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'expected', 'Broadway', 'veterans', 'Martha', 'Plimpton', 'Craig', 'Bierko', 'Patti', 'LuPone', 'Everyone', 'who', 'Sondheim', 'music', 'least', 'couple', 'favorite', 'songs', 'show', 'including', 'Little', 'Things', 'Do', 'Together', 'Sorry-Grateful', 'Barcelona', 'Marry', 'Me', 'Little', 'might', 'expect', 'LuPone', 'savage', 'rendition', 'Ladies', 'Who', 'Lunch', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'may', 'bring', 'song', 'so', 'closely', 'linked', 'Elaine', 'Strich', 'new', 'generation', 'very', 'loudest', 'audience', 'cheers', 'though', 'went', 'Katie', 'Finneran', 'assured', 'performance', 'Getting', 'Married', 'Today', 'cross', 'extremely', 'chewy', 'fast-paced', 'patter', 'routine', 'kind', 'personality-breakdown', 'song', 'Sondheim', 'Mama', 'Turn', 'GYPSY', 'Live', 'Laugh', 'Love', 'FOLLIES', 'Finneran', 'maintained', 'grace', 'humor', 'advancing', 'plot', 'proclaiming', 'candidate', 'Bellevue', 'doing', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'though', 'consummate', 'performer', 'bunch', 'be', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'who', 'much', 'put-upon', 'unmarried', 'Bobby', 'center', 'show', 'biggest', 'demands', 'made', 'terms', 'emotional', 'singing', 'wide-ranging', 'acting', 'Harris', 'singer', 'who', 'can', 'act', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'sing', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'can', 'do', 'anything.Why', 'am', 'giving', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'Not', 'material', 'generally', 'excellent', 'performances', 'borrow', 'Sondheim-ism', 'God', 'details', 'couple', 'aspects', 'show', 'presentation', 'seemed', 'less', 'heavenly', 'show', 'was', 'performed', 'Lincoln', 'Center', 'Avery', 'Fisher', 'Hall', 'beautifully', 'rich', 'New', 'York', 'Philharmonic', 'show', 'making', 'wide', 'shallow', 'performance', 'space', 'acting', 'play', 'musicians', 'ever', 'background', 'camerawork', 'sound', 'editing', 'were', 'anyone', 'could', 'ask', 'audience', 'brought', 'hometown', 'expectations', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'sometimes', 'applauding', 'turn', 'applauding', 'thunderously', 'song', 'was', 'quite', 'Fisher', 'Hall', 'grand', 'performance', 'space', 'breaches', 'normal', 'proscenium-stage', 'mode', 'decorum', 'gave', 'feel', 'well-upholstered', 'civic', 'center', 'DVD', 'feel', 'PBS', 'tribute', 'Moreover', 'tiny', 'flyer', 'came', 'DVD', 'box', 'offered', 'real', 'information', 'cast', 'other', 'little', 'back-patting', 'how', 'members', 'adjusted', 'schedules', 'one-time', 'offering', 'Nonetheless', 'Sondheim', 'fan', 'student', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'should', 'miss', 'version', 'COMPANY', 'was', 'presented', 'vintage', 'humor', 'quite', 'intact', 'who', 'were', 'disappointed', 'excerpted', '90-minutes-long', '1986', 'FOLLIES', 'COMPANY', 'played', 'full-out', 'two', 'hours', '25', 'minutes']",N/A

There is a fine line between projecting your voice to be heard and shouting the lines, and unfortunately, a few of the cast members cross that. There are a few spots where the singing is off-key. And the acting is a tad awkward in several scenes. It really gives you the feeling that they just threw this together and there wasn't a lot of rehearsing.

1575586,A1GB0HW46Y2EB,B008SBXFUU,Bruce G. Taylor,"[3, 4]","In addition to having a fine cast, this production of Stephen Sondheim's musical from the 1970's, ""Company,"" has the benefit of a great orchestra behind it -- certainly the finest orchestra (The New York Philharmonic)  and conductor (Paul Gemignani) any cast performing this piece has ever had.This would probably be classified as a stage/concert version of the show and this video presentation is most enjoyable.  Neil Patrick Harris is a fine ""Bobby"" and his performance of ""Being Alive"" is quite moving and very well sung.  In his interpretation of ""Side by Side,"" I would have preferred his not adding the little bends or breaks on certain notes.  The way Sondheim originally wrote it is just fine.  (I am hoping I live long enough to hear the National Anthem sung straight once again without the pop music crap that ""singers"" keep loading onto it.  I realize it isn't much of a song, but it is the only national anthem we have and it should be sung straight once in a while).Patty Lupone is a great performer in ""The Little Things You Do Together"" and the show-stopping ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" and her version of the latter certainly is powerful if just a bit stylized.  I am somehow more moved by Elaine Stritch's version which is a touch more cynical and if Stephen Sondheim's songs are anything at all, they are certainly often cynical or at least sardonic.The cast in general is enjoyable and Stephen Colbert does the octave jump at the conclusion of ""Sorry/Happy"" just fine.  I was biting my nails on that one.But I've always had a question about this show and it is: What's the story with Bobby?  Putting it succinctly, is he supposed to be straight or gay? I mean the character can be taken in two ways, can he not?  The lyric of ""Being Alive"" can certainly be interpreted as being sung by a straight or a gay lonely man........can't it?

1575590,A2K5IXQT6RNX34,B008SBXFUU,Christina Paige,"[0, 0]","This is the best production EVER of a show that needs exquisite interpretation to succeed. Past recordings have suffered from awkwardnesses that range from  the over-the-top mannerisms of stage actors playing to a present audience to the horrible, strident, flat tonalities that were epidemic in Broadway performances in the wake of the show Annie.THIS ensemble production is PERFECT: all the performers clearly love what they are doing, and they interact with great professional kindness. The cast includes Jon Cryer, whom I have loved since he played Duckie in Pretty in Pink; and an astonishing performance by Steven Colbert. We all knew he could sing after his hilarious Christmas Special a few years' back, but the story of how he got this role is a wonderful bit of backstage magic. He had invited writer-composer Stephen Sondheim onto his show The Colbert Report, and Sondheim was so impressed by Colbert that he invited him to be in the new production.All the cast members are splendid, but is the their interactiveness that proves the systems theory cornerstone that ""the whole is more than the sum of the parts.""  They play off each other flawlessly. Be sure to watch the expressions and body language of the person(s) who are NOT singing at the moment - there are all sorts of subplots that come flashing to the fore in these silent moments.The story concerns 4 sets of couples who all share a friendship with bachelor Bobby, played by the talented and still modest Neil Patrick Harris. Bobby goes through several relationships in the course of the show, some funny, some poignant, and he is understandably conflicted about the idea of getting hitched. One the one hand, he suffers from occasional loneliness and longing for a dream of happiness; on the other, he sees dark flashes of the sordid and ugly sides of marriage in his friends' relationships: boredom, infidelity, even cruelty. Furthermore, he knows his friends rely on him to represent, simultaneously, their dream of lost freedom and the elusive potential for perfect happiness with a to-be-found soul mate. One of the great songs is when all four husbands are living vicariously through the still unattached Bobby.Some famous songs can here be seen in their proper context, including ""The Ladies Who Lunch,"" ""I'm Not Getting Married Today,"" and ""You Could Drive a Person Crazy.""I cannot say enough good things about this show.

1575593,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,B008SBXFUU,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[27, 28]","Stephen Sondheim fans should rejoice that Lonny Price's superb  production of ""Company"" is now on DVD. Price restores and rescues ""Company"", (from the awful,  over-rated clutches of ""acclaimed"" director John Doyle) --  placing it firmly back in New York City in 1970. Well, it takes place there and it doesn't. ""Company"" actually takes place inside Bobby's (Neil Patrick Harris) mind.With ""Company,"" Sondheim effectively moved the musical theatre from the ""integrated musical"" (pioneered by his mentor Oscar Hammerstein II) into the ""concept musical."" The concept or ""theme"" of ""Company"" is the difficulty of maintaining interpersonal relationships in an increasingly depersonalized society. Sondheim writes in his career retrospective ""Finishing The Hat"", (""Company"") ""takes place not over a period of time, but in an instant in Robert's  mind; perhaps on a psychiatrist's couch, perhaps at the moment when he comes into his apartment on his thirty-fifth birthday."" The unattached and seemingly ""emotionally unavailable"" Robert imagines his surreal birthday party; reviewing his relationships with his ""good and crazy"" married friends, as well as his relationships with three disparate girlfriends (Chrysse Whitehead, Christina Hendricks and Anika Noni Rose). The ""in his head"" approach allows Robert's interactions with his married friends to unfold as a series of vignettes, outside of time and space. It also provides for a great amount of theatrical fluidity and versatility. In this cerebral-emotional  context, it is quite natural for Bobby's three girlfriends to pop in and sing ""You Could Drive A Person Crazy"" in the style of the Andrews Sisters; or Bobby and all of his friends to perform a vaudeville-circus routine to ""Side By Side-What Would We Do Without You?""But ""Company"" is  far from a cold, cerebral ""head trip"". It is, indeed, a profound emotional journey. Robert and his friends are all  full of angst,  deeply flawed and neurotic; which makes them wonderfully human. Sondheim's observations and commentary on relationships (married, divorced, or some stage of single to coupling or uncoupling) are, by turns, astringent, cynical, rueful and often ruthless. In my opinion, Sondheim is right on the emotional mark. As expected, Kate Finneran as Amy, the frazzled bride on the verge of a nervous breakdown, stops the show with her delivery of ""Getting Married Today."" Also as expected, Patti Lupone as Joanne, turns the stinging ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" into her own volcanic, personal tour-de-force. But this production delights and surprises in several unexpected ways as well. Martha Plimpton, Stephen Colbert, and Jon Cryer all make welcome and effortless transitions from TV comedy to musical theatre. Anika Noni Rose offers an exhilarating performance of ""Another Hundred People."" At the center of it all is the extremely charismatic and talented Neil Patrick Harris, who imbues Bobby with an easy but potent sexiness, instead of aloofness or cold, cocky arrogance. It is easy to see why everybody is so attracted to, and worried about, him. By the conclusion, and Bobby's big emotional breakthrough with ""Being Alive,"" Harris is also heartbreaking.Sondheim writes in ""Finishing The Hat"", ""Company"" is a show I'm extremely happy with. It influenced musicals, for good and ill, for years afterwards and continues to do so. It made a lot of grown-ups who had disdained musicals take them seriously, and it not incidentally gave me my first good notices.""",5,"""COMPANY"": A MUSICAL MASTERPIECE FOR ADULTS",1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,3475,"['Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'fans', 'should', 'rejoice', 'Lonny', 'Price', 'superb', 'production', 'Company', 'now', 'DVD', 'Price', 'restores', 'rescues', 'Company', 'awful', 'over-rated', 'clutches', 'acclaimed', 'director', 'John', 'Doyle', 'placing', 'firmly', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'City', '1970', 'Well', 'place', 'there', ""n't"", 'Company', 'actually', 'place', 'Bobby', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'Company', 'Sondheim', 'effectively', 'moved', 'musical', 'theatre', 'integrated', 'musical', 'pioneered', 'mentor', 'Oscar', 'Hammerstein', 'II', 'concept', 'musical', 'concept', 'theme', 'Company', 'difficulty', 'maintaining', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'increasingly', 'depersonalized', 'society', 'Sondheim', 'career', 'retrospective', 'Finishing', 'Hat', 'Company', 'place', 'not', 'period', 'time', 'instant', 'Robert', 'mind', 'perhaps', 'psychiatrist', 'couch', 'perhaps', 'moment', 'when', 'apartment', 'thirty-fifth', 'birthday', 'unattached', 'seemingly', 'emotionally', 'unavailable', 'Robert', 'surreal', 'birthday', 'party', 'reviewing', 'relationships', 'good', 'crazy', 'married', 'friends', 'as', 'well', 'relationships', 'three', 'disparate', 'girlfriends', 'Chrysse', 'Whitehead', 'Christina', 'Hendricks', 'Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'head', 'approach', 'Robert', 'interactions', 'married', 'friends', 'unfold', 'series', 'vignettes', 'time', 'space', 'also', 'great', 'amount', 'theatrical', 'fluidity', 'versatility', 'cerebral-emotional', 'context', 'quite', 'natural', 'Bobby', 'three', 'girlfriends', 'pop', 'sing', 'Could', 'Drive', 'A', 'Person', 'Crazy', 'style', 'Andrews', 'Sisters', 'Bobby', 'friends', 'perform', 'vaudeville-circus', 'routine', 'Side', 'Side-What', 'Would', 'Do', 'Company', 'far', 'cold', 'cerebral', 'head', 'trip', 'indeed', 'profound', 'emotional', 'journey', 'Robert', 'friends', 'are', 'full', 'angst', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'neurotic', 'wonderfully', 'human', 'Sondheim', 'observations', 'commentary', 'relationships', 'married', 'divorced', 'stage', 'single', 'coupling', 'uncoupling', 'are', 'turns', 'astringent', 'cynical', 'rueful', 'often', 'ruthless', 'opinion', 'Sondheim', 'right', 'emotional', 'mark', 'expected', 'Kate', 'Finneran', 'Amy', 'frazzled', 'bride', 'verge', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'show', 'delivery', 'Getting', 'Married', 'Today', 'Also', 'expected', 'Patti', 'Lupone', 'Joanne', 'stinging', 'Ladies', 'Who', 'Lunch', 'own', 'volcanic', 'personal', 'tour-de-force', 'production', 'delights', 'surprises', 'several', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'as', 'well', 'Martha', 'Plimpton', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'Jon', 'Cryer', 'make', 'welcome', 'effortless', 'transitions', 'TV', 'comedy', 'musical', 'theatre', 'Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'exhilarating', 'performance', 'Hundred', 'People', 'center', 'extremely', 'charismatic', 'talented', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'who', 'Bobby', 'easy', 'potent', 'sexiness', 'instead', 'aloofness', 'cold', 'cocky', 'arrogance', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'everybody', 'so', 'attracted', 'worried', 'conclusion', 'Bobby', 'big', 'emotional', 'breakthrough', 'Being', 'Alive', 'Harris', 'also', 'heartbreaking.Sondheim', 'writes', 'Finishing', 'Hat', 'Company', 'show', ""'m"", 'extremely', 'happy', 'influenced', 'musicals', 'good', 'ill', 'years', 'afterwards', 'do', 'so', 'made', 'lot', 'grown-ups', 'who', 'had', 'disdained', 'musicals', 'take', 'seriously', 'not', 'incidentally', 'gave', 'first', 'good', 'notices']",N/A

1575596,ASIEGG17K1UID,B008SBXFUU,"Ex-Buyer ""Thomas""","[0, 4]","Steven Sondheim if nothing else is consistent, Harold Prince never made a dime off any of his musicals.  Yet, he is considered and ""genius"" and he is there is no doubt about that.  And COMPANY is one of his ""longer"" running musicals (690 performances).  I remember seeing the original production with Dean Jones in 1970 when it opened about a month into its run.  Jones became ill, shortly after, and was replaced....I can not remember by whom.  Still Sondheim (yes, I am a fan) seems to do better in revivals than first-go-round.  Follies, saw that, yet was his biggest flop, other than Pacific Overtures (saw that too).  His shows, all of them, barely touched the 700 performances threshold, other than GYPSY (but I do not consider that to be a Sondheim musical, not in the legal sense). Still Prince backs him, and he shows end at about 700 performances.  The original of this is seared in my then 15 year old brain.  So, what about this production.I am probably the only person writing any review on this that saw the original, and I do not want to compare, as this is a period piece.  Let's start with why I did not give this 5 stars....Neil Patrick Harris.  I love him, but he is all wrong in the roll.  He is cute and he plays cute as opposed to Dean Jones sophisticated. And ""Bobby"" is suppose to be sophisticated and not cute.  But Harris can't help it.  There are too many ""cute"" looks throughout the production. He plays a grown up Doggie Howser as opposed to a sophisticated Doggie Howser.  His vocal range is actually better than Dean Jones, but again his ""cute"" looks make no note of that.  His version of ""Being Alive"" is far better than Dean Jones (both in person and on the LP, or CD).  Again, I have to go back to the cute factor, Bobby is not to be played as cute.Patty Le Pon is no Elaine Stritch.  I will leave it at that.  She does a great job with the hallmark song from this show ""Ladies who Lunch"", but again not even close to Stritch.The set is imaginative, the production is solid, the remaining cast are excellent.

One man, for example, is addicted to alcohol; a woman propositions him; a couple divorces, but enjoys being together; a girl friend is dumb but he enjoys sex with her, but only so much; another girl is very smart, but unable to enjoy any place outside New York. He discovers that relationships do not need to be perfect; they can even have painful moments and yet be fulfilling. The music is good. But there are no memorable songs as there is in Oklahoma. All of the actors are in good voice. The humor is ubiquitous, funny, and enjoyable. The acting is superb; every actor is good; we see facial expressions and they are just right.

1575610,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008SBXFUU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[74, 76]","When you're a theater lover, you greet every revival of a Sondheim work with great enthusiasm. ""Company,"" to my mind, has always been one of the master's more accessible pieces. Originally produced in 1970, the show may be a product of its time but with a powerhouse roster of songs including ""The Ladies Who Lunch,"" ""Being Alive,"" ""Side by Side by Side,"" and ""Another Hundred People,"" it makes for an era well worth revisiting. This star-studded production, shot at Avery Fisher Hall with the New York Philharmonic, certainly had a curiosity factor working for it with its eclectic cast. Headlined by Neil Patrick Harris, the show also features the always welcome Patti Lupone. But in addition to these two, the cast boasts a number of less likely (but no less recognizable) faces. Craig Bierko, Anika Noni Rose, Katie Finneran, Martha Plimpton (Raising Hope), Christina Hendricks (Mad Men), Jon Cryer (Two and a Half Men), and Stephen Colbert are some of the others on stage. This filmed version of that event was presented in theaters at a one night only showcase with Fathom Entertainment. And admittedly, I was first in line.""Company"" tells the story of a perpetual bachelor, in this instance played by Harris. With minimalist staging, he is surrounded by five married couples who are at hand to celebrate his thirty-fifth birthday. The couples are at different points in their relationships (from bliss to divorce) and all have an opinion about the lifestyle that the central protagonist has chosen to live. Whether it is envy or mild disapproval, the show features them battling him and one another in a series of mildly comic scenarios. Harris, as might be expected, shows a light touch with the dramatics of the work. He is effortless and likable and the show has an easy sexiness not always apparent in other productions. But it seems that the choice has been made to concentrate on the story as opposed to the song. So while amusing and pleasant, this production of ""Company"" lacks some of the big moments that you might be hoping for.While most of the voices are serviceable, none of the vocal performances come anywhere close to setting a new standard. To my mind, only Patti Lupone's rendition of ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" really brings down the house. But what else would you expect from such a diva? Unfortunately, the 2007 Broadway revival (with a tremendous Raul Esparza, also on DVD if you haven't seen it) was still quite fresh in my mind when I watched this. I thought that version was an absolute powerhouse and, frankly, this seemed much slighter by comparison. Still, I can't NOT recommend a Sondheim and if this cast brings a wider audience to appreciate his work, who am I to complain? And it is genuinely amusing to see a different side of some of the performers. I enjoyed ""Company"" fine. It's certainly not the definitive performance of this great musical, but it's still a bit of light fun.

The second is the one for sale on this page--the 2011 semi-concert version at Lincoln Center, featuring the New York Philharmonic and an all-star cast including Neil Patrick Harris, Patti LuPone, Stephen Colbert and Christina Hendricks.Which one to buy? Frankly, they're both great. I would say the Price-Esparza version is more serious and austere, the Price-Harris version more slapsticky and show-bizzy. That's not to say Price-Esparza isn't laugh-out-loud funny at times (its version of ""Not Getting Married Today"" is peerless) or that Price-Harris doesn't do justice to the story's serious moments. Both versions do full justice to Sondheim's magnificent songs and George Furth's cynical-poignant book.At this point, I prefer this version, though I might change my mind later.

It wasn't that long ago that we had the John Doyle version, but this new one is even better than that one.At first thought, I wouldn't have considered Neil Patrick Harris as Bobby, the bachelor and friend to several married couples, but he is exceptional in the role.  In his personal search into being single or being married, Bobby experiences marital squabbles and bliss through his married friends, best summed up by the song, ""Sorry/Grateful.""  Little by little, his hot bachelor nights with women like stewardess April leave him more than a little dissatisfied...until he realizes what he wants, revealed through ""Being Alive.""The cast is uniformly terrific.  Patti LuPone brings new dimension to Joanna, and especially in her rendition of ""The Ladies Who Lunch,"" a song that has been too long associated with the screeching of Elaine Stritch.  Stephen Colbert and Martha Plimpton are a delight as a couple trying to one-up each other. And Christina Hendricks as the stewardess April, a role completely unlike her part on Mad Men, is hilarious.Picture quality is excellent, a joy to watch.Likewise, the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is sensational.Extras are non-existant on the disc, which is a complete shame because I would have loved to have seen behind-the-production footage for this presentation.

As a Sondhead from way back, this is the ultimate of his works, right up there next to SWEENEY. I've seen seven or eight productions of it, over the years.  I was really looking forward to seeing this, a reaction to the controversial John Doyle Broadway production of '06. A return to a normal staging, rather than a radical new way of presenting it.  Seemed like a good idea. But, as Lonny Price, director of this New York Philharmonic production, says in his notes, the whole thing was put together in a couple of weeks, and the entire cast was only on stage, en masse, for a night or two before opening.  Well, It looks like it. It resembles a typical summer stock production, and that is totally unacceptable for a piece of this complexity. The cast is supposedly all-star, although I was unfamiliar with many of them. The key was supposed to be &#34;I didn't know he could sing. Wow. this is good.&#34; Well maybe that's ok for a production of ANNIE or some conventional musical, but not for this.  Jon Cryer probably handles the dialogue best, and LuPone really sells &#34;THE LADIES WHO LUNCH,&#34; but other than that, no. In fact, the last quarter of the show is fine, but getting there is a chore.  Vocally, and histrionically, it is disappointing.

1575630,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B008SBXFUU,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[5, 8]","Ironically the same reasons why I wanted to see this version are the same reasons why it left me cold. While Neil Patrick Harris and Patti Lupone justified their casting, other actors in the piece were cast for name recognition instead of their ability to play their roles. For example, Stephen Colbert is a great comedic actor who has honed the persona of the clueless conservative to a fine edged weapon. This serves him well when he's playing a drunk who is sniping with his wife about his drinking problems and her diet; however, when he gets to his song about the ambiguity of being married and wishing you were single, it's not terribly believable. This is the character's song that bears his soul and brings up the doubts and comfort of being marriage - but he's just Colbert and he can't really carry it off.It gets even more dire as the pot smoking scene which you know is supposed to be about how Bobby just doesn't get how married people communicate becomes a scene that seems borderline abusive. Every line Jon Cryer says to his wife sounds like he is ordering her around so when she leaves and he says ""she wasn't really into it"", it adds a discordant note of tension since it appears that Cryer is talking for his wife. Granted, this musical has roots in a play about dysfunctional marriages, but outright abusive marriages take away from the story.There are several other scenes that just don't work as theater. Everyone has fine voices. Christina Hendricks is much more aggressive as the dingbat stewardess than most actors. Yet, many of them seem like they are just singing the songs like they are in a recital rather than acting the music. The staging doesn't do them any favors. Marta's ""100 People"" song is just lying fallow as a good song but there's nothing about the actress that states that she has any opinion about those 100 people in either way.Even the ending is weak. Instead of Bobby realizing that he has to stop being single and move on with his life, he is just at the point where he sings that song.It's worth a view but probably not a purchase, especially not whenCompanyis out there.",3,Too much stunt casting,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",2013,2119,"['Ironically', 'same', 'reasons', 'why', 'wanted', 'see', 'version', 'are', 'same', 'reasons', 'why', 'left', 'cold', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'Patti', 'Lupone', 'justified', 'casting', 'other', 'actors', 'piece', 'were', 'cast', 'name', 'recognition', 'instead', 'ability', 'play', 'roles', 'example', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'great', 'comedic', 'actor', 'who', 'honed', 'persona', 'clueless', 'conservative', 'fine', 'edged', 'weapon', 'well', 'when', 'playing', 'drunk', 'who', 'sniping', 'wife', 'drinking', 'problems', 'diet', 'however', 'when', 'song', 'ambiguity', 'being', 'married', 'wishing', 'were', 'single', 'not', 'terribly', 'believable', 'character', 'song', 'soul', 'up', 'doubts', 'comfort', 'being', 'marriage', 'just', 'Colbert', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'carry', 'off.It', 'even', 'more', 'dire', 'pot', 'smoking', 'scene', 'know', 'supposed', 'be', 'how', 'Bobby', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'how', 'married', 'people', 'communicate', 'scene', 'borderline', 'abusive', 'line', 'Jon', 'Cryer', 'wife', 'ordering', 'so', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'discordant', 'note', 'tension', 'Cryer', 'talking', 'wife', 'Granted', 'musical', 'roots', 'play', 'dysfunctional', 'marriages', 'outright', 'abusive', 'marriages', 'take', 'away', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'scenes', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'theater', 'Everyone', 'fine', 'voices', 'Christina', 'Hendricks', 'much', 'more', 'aggressive', 'dingbat', 'stewardess', 'most', 'actors', 'many', 'seem', 'are', 'just', 'singing', 'songs', 'are', 'recital', 'rather', 'acting', 'music', 'staging', ""n't"", 'do', 'favors', 'Marta', '100', 'People', 'song', 'just', 'lying', 'fallow', 'good', 'song', 'nothing', 'actress', 'opinion', '100', 'people', 'way.Even', 'ending', 'weak', 'Instead', 'Bobby', 'realizing', 'stop', 'being', 'single', 'move', 'life', 'just', 'point', 'where', 'song.It', 'worth', 'view', 'probably', 'not', 'purchase', 'especially', 'not', 'whenCompanyis', 'there']",N/A
