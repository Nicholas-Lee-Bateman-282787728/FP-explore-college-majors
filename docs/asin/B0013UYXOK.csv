This isn't hard-core at all but it's a little more advanced than for a beginner.

I love it.I wish my knees weren't so unreliable--he does LOTS of squats, lunges, and moves; but I fixed that by just adjusting my range of motion. I can't go as low, but that's ok.

1144103,A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,B0013UYXOK,Little Miss Cutey,"[11, 11]","This is about my fourth or fifth workout from Rob.  I love all his previous workouts so I thought I'd give this a go and I'm glad I did.  This is really fantastic for working out almost every muscle in your body and it's challenging too.You use your different sets of weights along with a step to do these exercises.  You can either lighten or make heavier, your load of weight to push yourself or take it easier if the moves seem too difficult.  While there are a lot of the regular moves you'd expect from weight training, there are a few different like doing lunges with glute lifts which might help to 'shock' your muscles.  I love the music that goes along with this workout and they give you a bonus cd with the music on it.Rob is as friendly as ever and he's always reminding you about your form and technique but he doesn't over do it.  I don't have a lot of workouts led by male instructors and it's nice for a change.  He knows his stuff and he's created an excellent program that I'm able to stick with and really enjoy.  I hope you do too.",5,A great workout to sculpt your muscles :->,1209254400,"04 27, 2008",2008,1051,"['fourth', 'fifth', 'workout', 'Rob', 'love', 'previous', 'workouts', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'go', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'really', 'fantastic', 'working', 'out', 'almost', 'muscle', 'body', 'challenging', 'too.You', 'use', 'different', 'sets', 'weights', 'step', 'do', 'exercises', 'can', 'either', 'lighten', 'make', 'heavier', 'load', 'weight', 'push', 'take', 'easier', 'moves', 'seem', 'too', 'difficult', 'are', 'lot', 'regular', 'moves', ""'d"", 'expect', 'weight', 'training', 'are', 'few', 'different', 'doing', 'lunges', 'glute', 'lifts', 'might', 'help', ""'shock"", 'muscles', 'love', 'music', 'along', 'workout', 'give', 'bonus', 'cd', 'music', 'it.Rob', 'as', 'friendly', 'ever', 'always', 'reminding', 'form', 'technique', ""n't"", 'over', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'workouts', 'led', 'male', 'instructors', 'nice', 'change', 'stuff', 'created', 'excellent', 'program', ""'m"", 'able', 'stick', 'really', 'enjoy', 'hope', 'do', 'too']",Power Body Series Strength Training With Rob Glick

Another reviewer states that it is good for working out almost every muscle and she's RIGHT! You feel the burn for sure, depending on how much weight you use. YOu can mix it up with lighter weights or heavier, depending on what you can handle or in the mood for. AND...you get a bonus cd of the workout music, which is awesome. What a value?! You can't beat it. I haven't seen anyone else do that.

It's challenging!You will not be sorry for purchasing it!It has many exercises that other DVDs don't.  It is a total body workout.It's Rob with two women behind him doing what he does.  One of them works on an easier level and the other two work on the same one.  The girls are respectfully dressed. (not with their chests hanging out)You will sweat during this workout.
