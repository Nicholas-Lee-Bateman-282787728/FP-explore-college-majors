998404,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000G1R4R0,Cubist,"[12, 12]","For the first time on DVD, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1.There is also an audio commentary by the film's director Tom Shadyac. . Shadyac talks about how he ruthlessly edits his movies, always going for a fast pace and big laughs. He points out that originally the studio wanted someone like Chevy Chase or Rick Moranis but once Carrey came on board he drew upon his stand-up persona. Shadyac waxes on about the nature of comedy but with surprisingly little pretension. He also points out the bits that Carrey improvised in this fun, engaging track.Also included are the theatrical trailer and several vintage T.V. spots.When Nature Calls only has a theatrical trailer and vintage T.V. spots.Included in this box set are three episodes from the short lived cartoon series that aired on CBS from 1995 to 1997. ""The Reindeer Hunter"" sees Ace helping Santa find Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer who has been kidnapped. This episode opens with a surreal set piece involving a snowstorm inside Ace's apartment. This episode wisely adheres to the first movie in terms of tone with a spot-on impersonation of Carrey as Ace. There is also quite a bit of recycling in terms of catch phrases as well (including one of the most famous, ""Do NOT go in there!""). In ""Natural Born Koalas,"" Ace and his monkey sidekick investigate ill-tempered koalas that have gone from sedate and cuddly to downright feral. Finally, there is ""Dragon Guy"" which features Ace dreaming about him and his monkey rescuing a fire-breathing dragon which is as odd as it sounds.",3,Could have been better but not a total waste of money.,1160352000,"10 9, 2006",2006,1585,"['first', 'time', 'DVD', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'Pet', 'Detective', 'presented', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1.There', 'also', 'audio', 'commentary', 'film', 'director', 'Tom', 'Shadyac', 'Shadyac', 'talks', 'how', 'ruthlessly', 'movies', 'always', 'going', 'fast', 'pace', 'big', 'laughs', 'out', 'originally', 'studio', 'wanted', 'someone', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Rick', 'Moranis', 'once', 'Carrey', 'came', 'board', 'drew', 'stand-up', 'persona', 'Shadyac', 'waxes', 'nature', 'comedy', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'pretension', 'also', 'out', 'bits', 'Carrey', 'improvised', 'fun', 'engaging', 'track.Also', 'included', 'are', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'several', 'vintage', 'T.V', 'spots.When', 'Nature', 'Calls', 'only', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'vintage', 'T.V', 'spots.Included', 'box', 'set', 'are', 'three', 'episodes', 'short', 'lived', 'cartoon', 'series', 'aired', 'CBS', '1995', '1997', 'Reindeer', 'Hunter', 'Ace', 'helping', 'Santa', 'find', 'Rudolph', 'Red', 'Nosed', 'Reindeer', 'who', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'episode', 'surreal', 'set', 'piece', 'involving', 'snowstorm', 'Ace', 'apartment', 'episode', 'wisely', 'first', 'movie', 'terms', 'tone', 'spot-on', 'impersonation', 'Carrey', 'Ace', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'recycling', 'terms', 'catch', 'phrases', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'Do', 'NOT', 'go', 'there', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Koalas', 'Ace', 'monkey', 'sidekick', 'investigate', 'ill-tempered', 'koalas', 'have', 'gone', 'sedate', 'cuddly', 'downright', 'feral', 'Finally', 'Dragon', 'Guy', 'Ace', 'dreaming', 'monkey', 'rescuing', 'fire-breathing', 'dragon', 'as', 'odd']",N/A

998417,A319SKSB556033,B000G1R4R0,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[3, 3]","Ace Ventura is the movie that really kick-started the careers of Jim Carrey and, to a lesser extent, Courtney Cox although it is Carrey who makes this movie all his own by his wild and energetic performance as a half-insane Pet Detective. In case you're wondering that's a detective who tracks down missing animals. Ace is a great character, with his wacky clothes, groovy swagger, wild hair (LOVE that do) and unpredictable behavior. He's a page right out of Howlin' Mad Murdock's biography.Courtney Cox plays a boss for the Miami Dolphins who hires Ace to find their missing cetacean mascot Snowflake. They can't play without having their mascot y' know. It's paper thin and despite lasting about 85 minutes, it is kinda stretched too far.What could have been a half decent plot soon descends into lame-brain juvenile humor as Ace does his class clown bit, offends many people, and uncovers stupid and unfunny 'plot' twists. Tom Shadyac tries his best to make the film look colorful and vivid and, for the most part, succeeds but sometimes the production design looks a bit shoddy and I have no idea who allowed Sean Young to be in this movie. She's a terrible actress and makes every scene damn painful to watch. However, she is quite a MILF these days. Not in this movie though.There are some funny scenes and easy to see why Carrey went on to become such a big star but compared to the rest of Carrey's career it's a bit of an insult to his talent. I prefer the sequel, even though Ace is a full blown lunatic in it and appears a tiny bit more normal and human in this one.A fun movie to watch once in a long while. Not something to rely on for never-ending appeal.If there was to be just one pop-culture character with 'franchise' written all over it, it would be Ace Ventura. After the sleeper hit that was the original, Ace is shipped off to Africa, via Tibet, to find the missing sacred animal of the peaceful Wachati tribe. It is supposed to be a wedding gift to the savage Wachutu tribe, marking the congregation of their people.Ace is the best there is (the only there is) surely sending him to find the sacred bat (his most hated creature) is the 'right' thing to do. No matter how crazy he is. And how crazy indeed! This time around Jim Carrey goes completely wild as Ace. Any trace of an actual human that we saw before is surrendered to complete insanity. You can tell that Carrey is having the time of his life just ad-libbing and winging it. You can almost hear director Steve Oedekerk struggle to contain his laughter off-camera. There are even a few moments when Carrey himself almost cracks-up.I prefer the sequel to the first for a few reasons. First of all the production design is far superior and the faux-African jungle (actually South Carolina) and tribal village colors really come alive. The widescreen photography gives the film a more expansive look than Tom Shadyac's original. Plus, it has a lot more animals, which I think is cool. You gotta love the 'alrighty then' meditation scene too.Beside's the animated show (a few episodes are featured on this DVD set), there's been no more of Ace Ventura since. But don't rule him out.
