Delaspozas ""Alicia""","[0, 0]","In Treatment: The Complete Third SeasonA friend of mine was impressed with this series 3 years ago when the first season was shown in HBO,based on her opinion I bought the first season and I love the acting and the complexity of the different characters, after that I bought the second having the same effect and recently I bought the last one.I found this season outstanding, the acting was impeccable to be able to maintain the interest in the different cases with their problems and personalities, these sessions between the therapist and his patients in his office with little action, only the dialogue and acting. The cases were very interesting, dramatic and ultimately human.All of the cases involved a patient conflicts with their family, one of the cases is that a retired Indian professor who doesn't adapt to his life in American culture and wants to return to India, and an actress who has an ill sister and isn't able to communicate with her daughter and a teenage boy, adopted and gay who has problems with his adopted parents, knows the identity of his biological parents and doesn't know how to handle his relationships with his adopted parents nor other people.On the other hand Paul has his own problems, thinks he started to have symptoms to Parkinson diseases which he has inherited from his father, difficulties in maintaining relationships with his son and daughter .These difficulties which he grouchily admits to lead him to seek help from another therapist.In spite of all his problems he tries to help his patients to live with their own.The acting is outstanding as well as the direction.At the end of the series you realize that we all have a story.",5,An outstanding series,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,1677,"['Treatment', 'Complete', 'Third', 'SeasonA', 'friend', 'mine', 'was', 'impressed', 'series', '3', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'shown', 'HBO', 'based', 'opinion', 'bought', 'first', 'season', 'love', 'acting', 'complexity', 'different', 'characters', 'bought', 'second', 'having', 'same', 'effect', 'recently', 'bought', 'last', 'one.I', 'found', 'season', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'was', 'impeccable', 'be', 'able', 'maintain', 'interest', 'different', 'cases', 'problems', 'personalities', 'sessions', 'therapist', 'patients', 'office', 'little', 'action', 'only', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'cases', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'dramatic', 'ultimately', 'human.All', 'cases', 'involved', 'patient', 'conflicts', 'family', 'one', 'cases', 'retired', 'Indian', 'professor', 'who', ""n't"", 'adapt', 'life', 'American', 'culture', 'return', 'India', 'actress', 'who', 'ill', 'sister', ""n't"", 'able', 'communicate', 'daughter', 'teenage', 'boy', 'adopted', 'gay', 'who', 'problems', 'adopted', 'parents', 'identity', 'biological', 'parents', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'handle', 'relationships', 'adopted', 'parents', 'other', 'people.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Paul', 'own', 'problems', 'started', 'have', 'symptoms', 'Parkinson', 'diseases', 'inherited', 'father', 'difficulties', 'maintaining', 'relationships', 'son', 'daughter', '.These', 'difficulties', 'grouchily', 'lead', 'seek', 'help', 'therapist.In', 'spite', 'problems', 'help', 'patients', 'live', 'own.The', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'as', 'well', 'direction.At', 'end', 'series', 'realize', 'have', 'story']",N/A

I don't feel that disheartened, but there is something that is starting to feel a bit formulaic as well as depressing with this season. Part of it is the acting. Debra Winger's character (or maybe it is DW as an actress) just doesn't work or hold much interest. The displaced Indian, Sunil, is a good actor, but there isn't that much interesting depth--at least not 2 discs in. The best is the disaffected, adopted gay teenager.

Paul is dealing with issues of health and family, and trying to come to terms with his previous work with Gina who has written a novel that has left Paul up-ended.  He seeks out his own therapist, primarily because he has trouble sleeping but other issues come to the surface. He proves himself to be a difficult patient.  Paul has three new patients  this season.  Sunil is a widow from Calcutta.  His wife died six months ago and he has been brought to the United States where he is living with his son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren.  The friction is so thick you can cut it with a knife.  Frances is an actress and also the sister of a patient that Paul saw eighteen years ago.  Frances's sister has breast cancer and Frances is struggling with the possibility that she, too, may carry the Br-CA gene.  She has been separated from her husband for two years and feels alienated from her daughter. Jesse is a gay high school student with ADD who acts out sexually and drives Paul to distraction.  Jesse was adopted and does not feel connected to his adopted parents.  He has recently received a phone call from his birth mother and is vacillating about whether to call her or not.This is the best show on television.  The acting and writing are superb.

1330412,A2H8NP7I9LF6O8,B0038M2ANC,BruceK,"[0, 0]","I am in total awe of this amazing series, and I wonder both how it ever got made considering it has none of the typical elements of American media/TV and why there is so little commentary on it.The plot revolves around Paul Weston a aging middle aged psychoanalyst and his patients, but the hook is that on Friday Paul himself becomes the patient.This is quite simply brilliant and stands along in its fearless exploration of human beings and their fears and behaviors.For the week Weston is God, he holds court and controls all that goes on ... well, mostly, in the domain of his analytic office where he is cool, collected, BUT HUMAN in his efforts to help his patients, but slowly we see that Paul is human, and has frailties and faults and does not always help people, and in fact even Paul has doubts and fears if he does the right thing or not and if he has made a difference.In this cool controlled environment and life we see behind the facade the almost animalistic drives and irrational fears and needs that drive people. For example at one point one of Dr. Weston's patients bursts in on his in his private life with what appears to be a major breakdown, but we see how infantile this patient bahaves when he is unable to control his Dr. which seems to be his biggest need. Then the next day we see Pau himself do a very similar thing to his doctor and not be able to see the parallel at all.I wish I lived in the kind of country where people would watch and discuss programs like ""In Treatement"" instead of the mindless distracting idiocy of most average TV that is geared towards just taking people's minds off of their own inner world and what is going on with them, but until then I guess I'll have to be satisfied by appreciating the brilliance of this TV series and discussing it with a few friends and the people who comment on the Internet about such things.Not for everyone, but for those who find this kind of material interesting, this is a perfect 5/5 stars.A related book, that I have found interesting is Daniel Goleman's ""Vital Lies, Simple Truths"" which also deals, but as a non-fiction book about need for people to have defense mechanisms and how they work.

1330413,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B0038M2ANC,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[53, 56]","There was a great deal of unipolar depression littered along my family genetic tree.  So that I got it as a young adult and needed this kind of long term treatment seemed inevitable.  The way treatment is usually depicted in films and tv is that patient and therapist achieve a complete catharsis for the patient and the patient strides off towards what will now be a brilliant future which he or she will be able to handle without emotional turmoil.  Sadly, this rosy treatment plan only exists in most screenwriters' imaginations.The reality is that therapy is messy, as messy as life itself.  It starts and stops like the rest of life starts and stops, not at any great dramatic points but at quite ordinary and often unresolved points.  The patient teeters off to do life on his or her own for awhile and after some missteps will often come shakily back into therapy again with perhaps a different therapist.  Although the therapist comes across as all knowing and wise in session, if you stumble across your therapist's personal life, you discover his or her personal life eclipses your own in sheer messiness.This show captures the above like no other film or tv show ever has.  It has done so for three seasons.  It may have done it best in this season.  Gabriel Byrne does a tour de force job as therapist Paul Weston and indeed very much reminds me of my own first therapist. This season we see him in therapy with a new woman therapist plus him as the therapist with three new patients. My personal favorite has always been to see Byrne's Paul Weston in therapy and this season is no exception to that.  He is just a complete mess but in a wholly believable way.His three patients are a gay adopted boy, a retired widower from Calcuttan forced to live with his son and his family in New York and a middle aged actress (Debra Winger), whose sister is dying of breast cancer, like their mother did.  All three are compelling stories and the only sense you have at closing is that although certain issues have been resolved, manifold problems lay ahead for all of them at therapy's end.

The second is Jesse a petulant and disturbed 17 year old homosexual who is dealing with family issues within his adoptive family, being contacted by his birth parents and general teen-age angst.  The last patient is Frances, a semi well known actress currently starring in a Broadway play who initially starts treatment because she can't remember her lines.  Equally, if not more compelling than the other patients is Paul Weston himself as he continues his own therapy with a new therapist, Adele, brilliantly portrayed by Amy Ryan.

1330416,A15T487HNTIOF7,B0038M2ANC,Deborah S. Hall,"[0, 0]","The whole of the three seasons of In Treatment is ""about"" the personal and professional character of Paul Weston, as he is revealed through his sessions with his patients and in his own therapy sessions.  Seen this way, Season Three is a believable and inevitable extension of the character that we see in Season One and Two.  What we see in Paul is a person who is incapable of maintaining his professional separation from his patients and mostly unwilling even to try. Paul is the very image of a kind, caring therapist, but he is just not cut out to be one.  In Season One he becomes involved with his patient Laura and this leads to the destruction of his marriage.  He accuses his therapist Gina of being totally withdrawn and cold, whereas he, Paul, really cares about his patients.  He tells her, in a rare insight into himself, that he wants to stop being a therapist and become a counselor so that he is free to become involved and to openly care.  But he fails to act on this and continues into season Two as a therapist.  Here he crosses the line in a very necessary way  and really does immeasurable good-- he takes his young patient to her first chemotherapy session when he realizes that her life is on the line and that he must intervene as an agent in her life, and step outside his role as a therapist.  He also successfully manages to maintain his distance from a woman patient and manages to help her achieve genuine insight.  But in Season Three, he once again becomes involved with his patients in a way that trumps him and finally demonstrates to us and to him that, despite his gentle demeanor, kind eyes, careful questioning, genuine caring, he is mostly not cut out to be a therapist.  He is actually manipulated by one of his patients who succcessfully  seduces Paul into behaving as a friend and comrade.  Although the ending turns out well for this patient, it is because he has used Paul to achieve the ends he has envisioned for himself.  And finally, when drawn to his own therapist, Paul decides that he will leave his own therapy as well as his career as a therapist because he cannot endure the therapeutic relationship, neither as doctor or patient.  The almost inevitable ending has the feeling of truth to it.

1330417,A27W5AJNP6YX7Z,B0038M2ANC,"Ivy Bewley ""Hiedra""","[0, 0]","I absolutely love, love, love this show. I remember watching the first episode of the first season when Laura was sitting on Paul's couch, telling him a story about what happened to her in a bar. As it was a TV show, I was expecting a flashback. But that did not happen. They talked back and forth, back and forth, for the entire episode. I was beyond impressed. That is exactly what therapy is: all the therapist does is HEAR what the patient says. He can never SEE what actually happened. And that is exactly what we viewers experienced as well. And, this is exactly what acting is all about as well: keeping the viewer's attention with simple dialogue, plot, and TERRIFIC ACTING. I know this show is not for everyone, especially today's public who expects shows full of special effects. But this show kept up this format for three full seasons... three long seasons. Some shows have lame 12-episode seasons, so even if they last ""longer"" than this one, it doesn't mean much.Season Three was a fine ending to a very fine series. For a show that was on HBO, I also have to applaud their small use of obscene language. I think a lot of shows just do it because they can, not because they need to, or because of ""artistic expression."" Not EVERYONE talks that way. In Treatment got a little worse in that respect each season, and that would be my only complaint.I have some experience in therapy (the reason I had to check out this show), and in group therapy, and every time I meet a new group, there is one person I just cannot tolerate. And do not like listening to. In Season Three it was Sunil. Wow that guy was obnoxious! He didn't even have any problems. He was just obsessed with what he perceived to be his son's problems. And then he went around his son's house eavesdropping and being a voyeur. What a creep! And then, in Week 7, when we find out the real truth about him, I liked him even less. Wow. Well, unlike in real therapy, at least on the show, watching Sunil's sessions was still fascinating and kept my attention!Incidentally, in Season Two I hated Mia. She spoke to Paul as if she was a jealous ex-girlfriend instead of a therapy patient. She grated on my nerves. In Season One there wasn't really anyone I disliked. Interestingly, though, I always found myself siding with Jake during Jake and Amy's couples' therapy. Being female, I'm usually biased towards the woman, but she was just a weird lady.Anyway, back to Season Three. I really enjoyed Frances's sessions. Jesse irritated me at first because he came across as just an obscene, jerky teenager. But I got to sympathizing with him after a while. Paul's sessions with his new therapist Adele, however, were to me the most fascinating of this season. Well, if I had to pick.Paul's sessions with his therapist Gina in seasons past were always interesting. It always amused me that Paul interacted with his own therapist the same way he interacted with his own patients. He gets impatient. He gets angry when asked a question he thinks is not important. He gets angry when the therapist jumps on a ""random"" thing he says. He gets annoyed when the therapist refuses to answer a personal question. And in Season Three, even though he gets a new therapist, it is exactly the same. At first.(I once had a therapist who refused to answer ""personal"" questions. Do they really not realize how maddening that is? They get to know everything about us and we don't even get to know basic facts about them. This lady I had was so bad I would mention something I read in the newspaper that annoyed me, say ""Isn't that annoying?"" and she would just sit there and stare at me. Her opinion was too personal! I am glad I don't see her anymore.)I think Paul's sessions with Adele were even more fascinating than his sessions with Gina. I liked Gina a lot, and she was a really nice lady... although maybe I only think that because we got to know her a bit but we never got to know anything about Adele. That frustrated me just as much as Paul, I think! I felt so bad for him, trying to get information from Adele, and having her pretty much give him the silent treatment. I really don't think whether or not someone is married, or general information like that, is very personal. The sad thing is, I think Paul was making better progress with Adele than with Gina, if only he hadn't started to fall for her. I think it might be wise for him to get a male therapist in the future!Well, it's too bad that this show won't be coming back for a fourth season, but it was amazing while it lasted. I wish we could see more shows like it!",5,This is what acting is all about,1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,4588,"['absolutely', 'love', 'love', 'love', 'show', 'remember', 'watching', 'first', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'when', 'Laura', 'was', 'sitting', 'Paul', 'couch', 'telling', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'bar', 'was', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'expecting', 'flashback', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'talked', 'back', 'forth', 'back', 'forth', 'entire', 'episode', 'was', 'impressed', 'exactly', 'what', 'therapy', 'therapist', 'HEAR', 'what', 'patient', 'can', 'never', 'SEE', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'exactly', 'what', 'viewers', 'experienced', 'well', 'exactly', 'what', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'attention', 'simple', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'TERRIFIC', 'ACTING', 'know', 'show', 'not', 'everyone', 'especially', 'today', 'public', 'who', 'full', 'special', 'effects', 'show', 'kept', 'up', 'format', 'three', 'full', 'seasons', 'three', 'long', 'seasons', 'shows', 'have', 'lame', '12-episode', 'seasons', 'so', 'even', 'last', 'longer', 'one', ""n't"", 'mean', 'much.Season', 'Three', 'was', 'fine', 'ending', 'very', 'fine', 'series', 'show', 'was', 'HBO', 'also', 'have', 'applaud', 'small', 'use', 'obscene', 'language', 'think', 'lot', 'shows', 'just', 'do', 'can', 'not', 'need', 'artistic', 'expression', 'Not', 'EVERYONE', 'talks', 'way', 'Treatment', 'got', 'little', 'worse', 'respect', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'complaint.I', 'have', 'experience', 'therapy', 'reason', 'had', 'check', 'out', 'show', 'group', 'therapy', 'time', 'meet', 'new', 'group', 'one', 'person', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'tolerate', 'do', 'not', 'listening', 'Season', 'Three', 'was', 'Sunil', 'Wow', 'guy', 'was', 'obnoxious', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'problems', 'was', 'just', 'obsessed', 'what', 'perceived', 'be', 'son', 'problems', 'then', 'went', 'son', 'house', 'eavesdropping', 'being', 'voyeur', 'What', 'creep', 'then', 'Week', '7', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'real', 'truth', 'liked', 'even', 'less', 'Wow', 'Well', 'real', 'therapy', 'least', 'show', 'watching', 'Sunil', 'sessions', 'was', 'still', 'fascinating', 'kept', 'attention', 'Incidentally', 'Season', 'Two', 'hated', 'Mia', 'spoke', 'Paul', 'was', 'jealous', 'ex-girlfriend', 'instead', 'therapy', 'patient', 'grated', 'nerves', 'Season', 'One', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'anyone', 'disliked', 'Interestingly', 'always', 'found', 'siding', 'Jake', 'Jake', 'Amy', 'couples', 'therapy', 'Being', 'female', ""'m"", 'usually', 'biased', 'woman', 'was', 'just', 'weird', 'lady.Anyway', 'back', 'Season', 'Three', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Frances', 'sessions', 'Jesse', 'irritated', 'first', 'came', 'just', 'obscene', 'jerky', 'teenager', 'got', 'sympathizing', 'while', 'Paul', 'sessions', 'new', 'therapist', 'Adele', 'however', 'were', 'most', 'fascinating', 'season', 'Well', 'had', 'pick.Paul', 'sessions', 'therapist', 'Gina', 'seasons', 'were', 'always', 'interesting', 'always', 'amused', 'Paul', 'interacted', 'own', 'therapist', 'same', 'way', 'interacted', 'own', 'patients', 'impatient', 'angry', 'when', 'asked', 'question', 'not', 'important', 'angry', 'when', 'therapist', 'jumps', 'random', 'thing', 'annoyed', 'when', 'therapist', 'answer', 'personal', 'question', 'Season', 'Three', 'even', 'new', 'therapist', 'exactly', 'same', 'first', 'once', 'had', 'therapist', 'who', 'refused', 'answer', 'personal', 'questions', 'Do', 'really', 'not', 'realize', 'how', 'maddening', 'get', 'know', 'everything', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'know', 'basic', 'facts', 'lady', 'had', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'would', 'mention', 'something', 'read', 'newspaper', 'annoyed', 'say', ""n't"", 'annoying', 'would', 'just', 'sit', 'there', 'stare', 'opinion', 'was', 'too', 'personal', 'am', 'glad', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anymore', 'think', 'Paul', 'sessions', 'Adele', 'were', 'even', 'more', 'fascinating', 'sessions', 'Gina', 'liked', 'Gina', 'lot', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'lady', 'maybe', 'only', 'think', 'got', 'know', 'bit', 'never', 'got', 'know', 'anything', 'Adele', 'frustrated', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Paul', 'think', 'felt', 'so', 'bad', 'trying', 'get', 'information', 'Adele', 'having', 'pretty', 'much', 'give', 'silent', 'treatment', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'not', 'someone', 'married', 'general', 'information', 'very', 'personal', 'sad', 'thing', 'think', 'Paul', 'was', 'making', 'better', 'progress', 'Adele', 'Gina', 'only', 'had', ""n't"", 'started', 'fall', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'wise', 'get', 'male', 'therapist', 'future', 'Well', 'too', 'bad', 'show', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'coming', 'back', 'fourth', 'season', 'was', 'amazing', 'lasted', 'wish', 'could', 'see', 'more', 'shows']",N/A

The real work of therapy only starts when you discover that holding your parents responsible for your problems really doesn't solve as much as you thought it would. Good to have someone to blame.'In Treatment's third year you will again find four half-hour episodes per week. The first three half-hours are Paul's ongoing sessions with his patients, and the final one brings us inside Paul's sessions with his therapist. His therapist for the first two years is gone, and a new one, Adele, is on the scene. And, she is a therapist that we all want. Intelligent and insightful, she brings Gabriel Byrne, Paul, to his senses. She will not allow him to wallow in his misery and points it out, weekly, with force.the other three patients are a mixed group. Debra Winger as Frances, an actress who come to Paul when she begins to have trouble remembering her lines. Sunil, a new widower from India who has come to live with son and his family, deeply unhappy and seemingly in a depressed state. Jesse, an adopted gay teen who is promiscuous and torn between his lovers and his families. All of them fascinating in their own way, but it is Adele, played by Amy Ryan, who keeps our focus. Sharp, she begins to get inside Paul's head, and he begins to wonder if what he thought was true, indeed is.Gabriel Byrne is a force to be reckoned with. His performance is award winning and so convincing that at times his wounds are palpable.
