If you want a really good toning workout then this is the workout for you!This workout is a bit &#34;dated&#34; since it was made in the early 90's (I think). However, this workout stands still on its own and surpasses many newer workouts. It is all weights, but your heart rate will stay up there during the standing &#34;4-limb-type&#34; upper body part. I wouldn't call this a &#34;body building&#34; type workout since you do use light weights so for heavy dumbells you would probably want to use a different video..BUT this will give you a great shape and tone your body like never before!!The workout:6 1/2 min of warm upLower Body (standing) Toning 6 1/2 minStanding Upper Body Tonight (you do light 4-limb since you are moving your legs but there is NO jumping or aerobics) 20 minLower Body (Floor Toning)- 30 min (ankle weights and a small medicine ball used but I didn't use my medicine ball and even if you do not use ankle weights it is still a killer lower body floor workout).Abs- 15 min (get ready to do ALOT of floor ab work)! The abs are easy to do, but you will feel them!!I did the full workout (it has different chapters where you can choose to mix and match your own segments but I did the whole entire thing).All the moves are basic but VERY effective (and you will feel the burn the next day-especially your arms and quads!!).The Upper Body part is KILLER-I use 3lbs with this and oh boy you don't think 3lbs is anything, but just you wait! LOL The upper body moves are constant and even someone using 2lbs will probably still feel challenged. For very advanced exercisers, you can use heavier weights to make it more challenging although I do not advise to use anything heavier than 8lbs for the Upper Body since she does move a little fast in one part with them (just in one part where she does this bicep tricep back and forth move torwards the end of the upper body toning part). But most of them are slow and controlled and very fun to do.Think &#34;Classic FIRM Vol 2 'Low Impact Aerobics'&#34; when it comes to a similar video workout (with Janet Jones)-although THIS workout was more challenging for the upper body since I can easily use 5lb for the entire upper body segment from FIRM vol 2. (Anyone who has done the FIRM Classic Vol 2 will know what I am talking about). But these two workouts will surely get your arms into tip top shape!!The Floor toning is very nice and time goes by pretty fast as there is no dread factor to me with this workout. The music is dated but you get so into the workout that you may not even notice it. ;)The Abs are easy basic moves but nicely slow and controlled you WILL feel the burn!!As always Karen gives excellent form pointers and her cuing is wonderful in this one!!

828372,A2TMQJD6VMSFHM,B00029NLHS,"Kat Ramone ""katramone""","[17, 17]","Once again, thinking that I was in great shape, I added yet another workout to my library to ""mix things up.""  Part of my workout routine includes alternating upper and lower body workouts within my usual routines, and since I have discovered ""Karen Voight,"" I thought I would try her ""Great Weighted Workout.""  The DVD allows one to ""mix and match"" routines, which work out to be approximately 35-40 minutes per upper or lower body, or do the entire workout, which is about 80 minutes.  I had only been doing the ""mix and match,"" which are pretty challenging in themselves, but finally decided to do the entire routine.  WHEW!  Because of the intensity of doing the ""upper"" and ""lower"" workouts, I knew the workout would be tough, and it is.  I would not recommend this workout for beginners because of the intensity and fast pace, but if one is a beginner, one may want to ""mix and match"" and either begin with very light weights (dumbbells, ankle weights and a small body ball are used), or no weights at all until one is comfortable moving up a notch.I use reasonably heavy weights (dumbbells and ankle) for my workouts, but because Karen's pace is very fast, I found myself not being able to keep up with the exercises using the heavy weights and stuck with 5 pound dumbbells for the upper body--I used my heavier weights and ankle weights for the lower body and abdomen sections, but during the standing lower body routine, Karen does combine both leg and arm movements with the dumbbells, so for the squats I could use the heavy weights--when she would work the arms (bicep and other moves) and legs together, it was difficult to keep the pace using heavier weights.  I would definitely suggest that one keep several sets of weights (3-5-8+) in case one cannot keep up with the fast paced moves, or if the weights become too heavy one can lower the weight.  Additionally, the DVD recommends ""light dumbbells, ankle weights, a body ball and a mat...""Although the release date is 1991, the routine is not dated.  It is well structured with a good warm-up, standing lower body workout (squats and squats with arm movements using weights and quite a bit of ""swinging"" of the weights, which is why I would not recommend too heavy weights), a really fast-paced, thorough upper body weight workout (I was huffing and puffing by then!), and a lower body floor routine using ankle weights, a weighted body ball (I have never used these, but they look like a good alternative to using a weight on one's leg for extra resistance), and/or a weight for added resistance.  Again, the routine is fast-paced and she really works the muscles--outer/inner thighs, quads, hamstrings, buttocks...Believe me, I felt it all!  She then moves to the abdomen using the ankle weights, body ball or dumbbell option, and finally finishes the routine with a good stretch.  Believe me, one will be saying ""THANK YOU!"" when that stretch comes, but one will and should feel completely ""worked out!""During the routine, especially the standing lower and upper body, I could really feel my heartrate climb, so again, be prepared to feel some aerobic benefits with this weighted workout.  When I first did the routine alternating upper and lower, I was really sore the next day, but it was a ""good workout"" sore.  Doing the entire routine is something I will incorporate probably once-a-week in order to perform a totally tough, invigorating, top-of-the-line workout.  One certainly gets one's money's worth, so to speak, but more important, one will receive an excellent workout--whether ""mixing and matching"" routines, or doing the entire workout.Although I truly recommend this workout for those who want to improve their fitness through a good weight routine, I must stress again that if one is beginning, go easy or one may end up with injuries--so work into it.  If one's a regular exerciser who wants to add a bit of toughness to one's routine, this DVD really works.  Be prepared though...Once again I thought I was in great shape and STILL found myself very sore the next day!Check out Karen's body during the workout--she has great muscles and muscle tone, which is a great incentive!

So the muscle has that good fatigue afterwards.What I don't like about it:- They are little goofy. They hoot and she teases them about more reps. It's a little co-ed movie-ish.- She doesn't really tell you what the count is and then she'll change it on you.

828375,A1MZJ977WMS382,B00029NLHS,Reviewer,"[19, 19]","This DVD was my first introduction to Karen Voight. I could tell she is a great instructor but this workout was not for me. As soon as I popped it in and attempted to watch the routine before trying it, my first reaction was that I would have had a hard time keeping up when I was 23, much less at 43. Coming from a routine that includes Pilates, walking, and non-aerobic sculpting with weights, this was like culture shock to say the least.My biggest problems were the very fast pace and the leg movements accompanying upper body workout. When I am working out the upper body I like to concentrate on perfecting the movements without worrying about the lower body and dislike dancing around, simultaneously doing cardio, and trying to keep my legs moving in a pattern at the same time. By the time I caught on to one movement, she switched. Very frustrating. It brought back bad memories of Jane Fonda to me. After a typical 15 hour day, I look to exercise to help me relax and unwind. The aerobic pace and the awful disco-y music had the opposite effect on me.Worse, Karen's movements were somewhat obscured because the four exercisers behind her were all standing too close to her, which lent a confusing effect of many arms and legs swishing around. I finally found the answer to this visual confusion was to concentrate on one of the men to her left, since he had no one directly in back of him and his movements were much easier to follow. The two women in the back row were little more than clutter - you couldn't see their moves at all and they added to the overall cramped feel of an otherwise expansive studio setting.If, like me, you don't care to contend with fast pacing, grating music that drones out the instructor's voice, and choreography when you're trying to concentrate on correct form, you will want to pass this up. But if you're a high energy, aerobics type who likes to follow hyperactive dance-y routines, you might like this one.On a final note, even though I gave up on the upper body, I briefly checked out the lower body floor work and that seemed to be more along the lines of what I was looking for.

There is nothing more frustrating that doing a dvd that has you jump, circle, backflip, sit down, stand up, roll over etc at such a pace that you would never learn it. Then they say something like ok reverse! Boom and you are supposed to do it a lightening speed. This didn't have that, thank god! It was a very challenging workout and at times I had to rest. My abs feel really worked and if that section was any longer I wouldn't have finished it, so I am glad it was only 15 minutes, even though it seemed much longer. 2 or 3lb dumbbells are recommended but I used 1lb wieghts and switched off to the 2lb ones as I felt more comfortable. It was a very good workout with just the 1lb and I recommend starting there.

Anyone who's a fan of Karen can tell she's quite young as are the two guys working out in this one that are much older in the newer stuff. That aside, the workout is killer! Karen it is a tough cookie! I used 5lb weights and nearly blasted my shoulders and arms off!!! It looks like they're only using like 3lb weights, which is what I suggest. At 5lbs I couldn't do all the reps and I'm an advanced exerciser.
