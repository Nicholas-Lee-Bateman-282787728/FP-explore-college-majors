This was not a town western, but filmed on location in the real West.  Just plain and simple as I imagined it really was.  I have no way of verifying if 26 MEN was based on the files of the Arizona Rangers.The TV 26 men used the standard Winchester rifle's from New Haven, and Colt's from Hartford. The horses did not carry fifty pounds of jangling silver while chasing down the bad guys.  No trick horses or dogs.  They did not wear uniforms. No guitars or harmonicas, secret caves, or whips, no capes.  No gimmicks, no badges, no fat funny sidekicks.  No sawed off rifles with big levers, shotguns or canes, or long barreled six shooters.  No silver bullets, no big butcher knives, and no half-rifles/half shotguns.  No dogs, or sure-shot sisters, or aeroplanes.  No personal shoot outs in the alley.  They did not drive a jeep.There was one West Point trained knight without armor, no gimmick lone gunman roaming the West in those days, but he had a custom made signal action Colt .45 with rifling in the barrel, and a surprise get off me derringer in his belt.
