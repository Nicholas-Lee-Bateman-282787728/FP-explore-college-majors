It frequently leaves you in the dark to think and that includes the involved soldiers. This is done just like a real government, it's what I call the ""mind over matter"" syndrome; they don't mind and you don't matter!

Then you can go back and add in the lore to get more understanding of what was taking place.So, few movies today offer such an intelligent experience of unknown phenomenon.

However, as this elite military force enters the point of no return in the Afghan wilderness, the danger mounts and the facts don't add up.

The acting is good and the film definitely kept my interest as the intensity and mystery kept increasing as the film progressed.

As the viewer, along with the team, tries to figure out what could be the source of the phenomenon, one is forced rule out various hypotheses.  One option is that it is an ancient and highly advanced alien with a raging antisocial personality disorder, based on the sadistic, malicious nature of whatever is behind the phenomenon.

Like Blair Witch, he strands a group of people, in this case a special ops force, in a hostile environment and sets a supernatural agent upon them.These special ops dudes, headed by a CIA operative, are in search of, what we're told, may be nuclear weapons in Afghanistan. He gives his men some more benign story but they know something's up. Even with the help of a local guide, they become lost. Is it because all their high-tech gear ceases to function or has the terrain actually changed.Soon they are set upon by an enemy and, one by one, they are picked off or choose to off themselves. Mr. CIA is filming all of this with an infra-red camera and uplinking it home via infra-red. He sees things through the camera his men cannot see and finally he spills the beans to the one remaining soldier. He is trying to verify, for the CIA, the existence of Vimanas which seem to be an other-worldly force that may have been around even before Alexander the Great's conquests. They may be the ultimate weapon.As I mentioned, it's a remake of Blair Witch but with a larger budget and scope. Myrick even uses a re-occurring icon not dissimilar to the one used in Blair Witch. This is a good, solid undertaking with a mid-sized budget. The story is good. The acting is adequate and the directing is solid. As another reviewer noted, this shows you don't need truckloads of money and huge stars to make a good movie. Granted, had this had some known names, it would have gotten better backing and distribution but that's the business, not the art. If you're at all disposed to this kind of film, this is well worth your time and money.I will argue the ending.

SO soldiers are highly trained to deal with the rigors of isolation and operating on their own, usually in enemy territory. They are pretty much considered expendable. It is difficult to write a screenplay about something like this because it would concern mostly interaction among strongly egoed and forceful men who have to work together.

Simple Afghan villagers are portrayed with respect and sympathy, as is the old hermit-cleric. Questions and mysteries pile up and, as in ""Blair Witch Project"", they will not be fully answered.

But let's be honest: director Daniel Myrick had access to film in a desert/mountainous region and wanted to make a movie out of it.Undercover CIA agent Benjamin Keynes (Jonas Ball) narrates in hushed whispers this doomed mission, which may or may not be a suicide run to discover a terrorist known only as Muhammad.  Unless of course it's THAT Muhammad, in which case discovering him would be a pretty big deal since, you know, he's a divine prophet.Thrown into the mix are Vimanas, the ancient Indian flying saucers, ghostly Arabs in black garb, and many, many blurry shots taken by an infrared camera.

It doesn't rely on special effects to make the story, which is refreshing in an era when EPM (Explosions Per Minute) seem to drive the success of too many movies. I'm a die hard sci-fi fan and seeing the genre become more popular to general audiences has been a blessing and a curse; more movies in the genre are produced, but the stories are often flimsy. I give this one kudos for having a plot that was engaging.Like others I'm not sure what to make of the ending. I'm fine with endings that don't necessarily resolve the conflict in the story arc -in fact I often prefer that as it generally seems more realistic than one that knits all the loose end and tosses a happy ending out to get to it and roll the credits - but something about this left me dissatisfied. It gave me the sense that there needed to be 10 more minutes of story. It was more like the mysterious ending wasn't quite long enough to make it compelling. To use a very controversial ending as a means of explaining this, I'll refer to the Sopranos. We didn't get any specific answers, but the loose-ends-ending gave enough information for viewers to speculate about what could have happened after the series officially ended. Love or hate the ending of the Sopranos, the writers gave fans enough to argue about for years. This movie didn't achieve even that.
