The husband works for a publisher of paperbacks; they know how the cover can sell the product. [Still true today?] The script requires the man to speak and tell about the story. He seems to have a vivid imagination. The fantasies seem like a version of ""Walter Mitty"" that parodies other films with its humor. [The prices date this film.] A ""strike-anywhere"" kitchen match is used to light a cigarette. Then a young woman shows up to tell about her life. Her talk mocks the advertising game and television. This story certainly stretched the envelope for films. Was this the result of the new policies of the Eisenhower administration?The film mentions the new psychological studies that were used to influence popular opinion. A sensational cover is used for a scientific publication! The office scene shows people working to 6PM. The film continues with more playful scenes of teasing farce. In those days people squeezed oranges to get juice; still the best method. In the end Richard Sherman decides to leave for a vacation with his family.

315262,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302484405,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 6]","The concept behind `The Seven Year Itch', and in ways even its execution, I really `get', but there is just something about the finished product that feels underdone, or maybe just done wrong.  I am new to the Billy Wilder fan club, but I've grown to adore just about every movie he's done.  This is the only one of the six I've seen this past month that doesn't sit right with me as a finished product.  In parts I love it, but lumped together it just doesn't translate well for me.The story is one that I think is brilliantly crafted, because it is so much more than a mere tale of attraction.  This is a study of the male libido; the lies we tell ourselves to convince ourselves we deserve love and admiration.  This is a delicately crafted tale of intentional deceit and for that it deserves some major recognition.  The film centers on Richard Sherman, a successful married man who sends his wife and son away for the summer.  Unlike his male counterparts, Richard is determined not to fall into the summer fling territory, but then he meets a beautiful blonde staying in his apartment complex for the summer and soon his imagination is going haywire.The entire film is shot like one long soliloquy, which at times adds to the humor but in the end takes away from the seriousness of the films subject.  The ranting of Richard is at times funny and witty and at other times overdone and irritating in its redundancy.  This may be due to the fact that actor Tom Ewell is slightly obnoxious in his delivery, but I think that talking every thought and emotion of a character would be hard on any actor.Marilyn Monroe is without doubt the highlight of the film, for her infectiously bouncy portrayal of the desirable yet unattainable woman is spot on perfection.  This was an iconic role for Miss Monroe, one that she will always be remembered for, and with good reason.  She captures the naivety and innocence that makes a girl of her nature so desirable, and she serves up some of the funniest moments in the film.In the end, the idea behind `The Seven Year Itch' is far more rewarding than the finished product.  I absolutely adore the concept and believe wholeheartedly in the message.  It is honest and rich with purity in its depiction (or attempted depiction) of the `real' man and his struggle with self security.  I just wish that the film had been handled differently.  Maybe I'm looking at it wrong, since it was adapted from a stage play where soliloquy form is much more tolerable and necessary, but that is why film adaptations have to take liberties with material.  What plays out as believable and normal even on the stage comes off as awkward and uncomfortable on the screen.I won't say that you should stay away from this film, just know that it is not as effective as Wilder's other films.  It still has that humor he is (was) so famous for, it just doesn't feel as complete or as satisfying as a film like `Some Like it Hot' or `Irma la Douce'.",3,Doesn't quite scratch the itch...,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,2964,"['concept', 'Seven', 'Year', 'Itch', 'ways', 'even', 'execution', 'really', 'get', 'just', 'something', 'finished', 'product', 'underdone', 'maybe', 'just', 'done', 'wrong', 'am', 'new', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'fan', 'club', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'adore', 'just', 'movie', 'done', 'only', 'one', 'six', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'past', 'month', ""n't"", 'sit', 'right', 'finished', 'product', 'parts', 'love', 'lumped', 'together', 'just', ""n't"", 'translate', 'well', 'me.The', 'story', 'one', 'think', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'mere', 'tale', 'attraction', 'study', 'male', 'libido', 'lies', 'tell', 'convince', 'deserve', 'love', 'admiration', 'delicately', 'crafted', 'tale', 'intentional', 'deceit', 'major', 'recognition', 'film', 'centers', 'Richard', 'Sherman', 'successful', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'wife', 'son', 'away', 'summer', 'male', 'counterparts', 'Richard', 'determined', 'not', 'fall', 'summer', 'fling', 'territory', 'then', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'staying', 'apartment', 'complex', 'summer', 'soon', 'imagination', 'going', 'haywire.The', 'entire', 'film', 'shot', 'one', 'long', 'soliloquy', 'times', 'humor', 'end', 'away', 'seriousness', 'films', 'subject', 'ranting', 'Richard', 'times', 'funny', 'witty', 'other', 'times', 'overdone', 'irritating', 'redundancy', 'may', 'be', 'due', 'fact', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Ewell', 'slightly', 'obnoxious', 'delivery', 'think', 'talking', 'thought', 'emotion', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'actor.Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'doubt', 'highlight', 'film', 'infectiously', 'bouncy', 'portrayal', 'desirable', 'yet', 'unattainable', 'woman', 'spot', 'perfection', 'was', 'iconic', 'role', 'Miss', 'Monroe', 'one', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'good', 'reason', 'naivety', 'innocence', 'girl', 'nature', 'so', 'desirable', 'up', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film.In', 'end', 'idea', 'Seven', 'Year', 'Itch', 'far', 'more', 'rewarding', 'finished', 'product', 'absolutely', 'adore', 'concept', 'believe', 'wholeheartedly', 'message', 'honest', 'rich', 'purity', 'depiction', 'attempted', 'depiction', 'real', 'man', 'struggle', 'self', 'security', 'just', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'handled', 'differently', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'looking', 'wrong', 'was', 'adapted', 'stage', 'play', 'where', 'soliloquy', 'form', 'much', 'more', 'tolerable', 'necessary', 'why', 'film', 'adaptations', 'have', 'take', 'liberties', 'material', 'What', 'out', 'believable', 'normal', 'even', 'stage', 'off', 'awkward', 'uncomfortable', 'screen.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'should', 'stay', 'away', 'film', 'just', 'know', 'not', 'as', 'effective', 'Wilder', 'other', 'films', 'still', 'humor', 'was', 'so', 'famous', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'complete', 'as', 'satisfying', 'film', 'Hot', 'Irma', 'la', 'Douce']",Seven Year Itch VHS
315263,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6302484405,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","Tom Ewell won the 1953 Best Actor Tony for George Axelrod's comedy, THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH. The play had 1151 performances from 11/20/52 to 8/13/55. Unlike the movie, Broadway audiences heard the inner thoughts of both Ewell and ""the Girl."" These lines were read by off-stage actors.The photo on this product page of Marilyn Monroe on a Manhattan subway grate is far more revealing than the sequence used in the movie. During an early morning location shoot, Marilyn's husband Joe DiMaggio stood by while a noisy crowd of 5000 spectators distracted her enough to ruin 40 takes. Each time that dress rose in the air so did Joe's blood pressure. The footage re-shot later has close-ups and discreet angles that show little of MM's torso but irreparable damage had already been done. By the time this movie hit theaters, Monroe's troubled marriage to DiMaggio was long over.SYNOPSIS--In Billy Wilder's toned-down adaptation of an often frisky play, Ewell reprises his stage role of a married man at loose ends while wifey and son are vacationing in Maine. Straitlaced publishing exec Richard Sherman fantasizes about the babe who's subletting the upstairs apartment, but it's the 1950s so nothing much happens beyond him feeiing guilty and them getting seen together by the building's nosy custodian.Reminiscent of Thurber'sWalter Mitty, Sherman's vivid imagination plays out a variety of scenarios. In this case, his daydreams run the gamut from romantically comic to terrifying.

I am not too sure that Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto was not used to remind us of ""A Brief Encounter"" (1945).The basic story line is, ever since the time of Native American Manhattan's; in the summertime wives and children go south for the summer to escape the excessive heat. This leaves a residual of working husbands and sprinkling of single women. Or to be more precise, Tom Ewell and Marilyn Monroe. Tom has a great imagination and we see many of the scenes through his imagination. As the two accidentally meet and start to converse, Richard Sherman's (Tom) imagination only gets more exotic.I am not going to quote the movie lines or scenes as if you have previously viewed this movie, then you know them by hart.

315268,A2YQ729V284ON2,6302484405,"B. Illes ""bobbygoode""","[0, 0]","This is the iconic Marilyn Monroe film (she's only referred to as &#34;the girl&#34;), wherein she famously stands over the subway grate in Manhattan in order to cool off from the summer heat. (That really annoyed her soon to be ex-husband Joe DiMaggio). She is absolutely at the top of her beauty and her performing abilities (albeit as the quintessential &#34;dumb blonde&#34;), and lights up the screen with her charisma. Tom Ewell is the perfect foil - the henpecked dufus who falls for her while his wife is on vacation. Fabulous story, with sharp jokes and dialogue by Billy Wilder, based on the more daring play. Hysterical and dead-on commentary on the state of marriage and social mores of the 1950's - (but in some aspects things are not a whole lot different now).

315274,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6302484405,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[41, 50]","""Chapter 6-the Brubaker-Steichel theory of the sporadic infidelity pattern of the married male, or the Seven Year Itch.""Having sent his wife Helen and son Ricky to Maine to avoid the scorching July Manhattan summer, Richard Sherman, ""keymaster"" of a pocket edition publisher, stays behind to work, promising his wife to abstain from drinking and smoking.  ""Some husbands think just because their wives are away for the summer, they can run wild.""  However, the appearance of a young blonde renting his upstairs neighbours' apartment turns his life topsy-turvy, turning him into a bundle of nerves.Sherman approves the covers of the pulp books:  ""Soup up the title a little, get yourself a cheerful and interesting cover.  It's a question of imagination, and Mr. Sherman has a lot of it,"" says the narrator.  To quote his wife and as a promoting film technology gag, ""lately, you've been imagining in Cinemascope and Stereophonic sound.""  From his imagination, including a parody of the beach scene in From Here To Eternity, we learn that he doesn't feel he's good-looking or charismatic.  It's his time with The Girl that changes him.  His imagination ranges from the humorous, ridiculous, even paranoid.  And he reveals his thoughts in soliloquys, which at times resemble trains-of-thought or even his subconscious.The Girl turns out to be a typical blonde, but fun-loving, friendly, with simple tastes, understanding, trusting, and as it turns out, compassionate as seen from her sympathy for the creature of the black lagoon:  ""He wasn't really all bad.  I think he just craved a little affection, you know.  A sense of being wanted and needed.""  Oh, and she's definitely not a Rachmaninoff girl.My take on the skirt scene?  Maybe I'd seen so many pictures of posters of it that it wasn't a big deal, and it's a bit overhyped.  There's plenty of superlativememorable dialogue, much of it funny, that boosts this movie.  However, the Girl has the best one.  When Sherman tells her he imagines a girl to love someone like Gregory Peck, she tears into him.  ""You think every girl's a dope?  You think a girl goes to a party and there's this one guy, a great big hunk in a fancy striped vest strutting around like a tiger, giving you that 'I'm so handsome you can't resist me look?  And from this she's supposed to fall flat on her face?  Well, she doesn't fall on her face.  But there's another guy in the room, way over in the corner.  Maybe he's kind of nervous and shy and perspiring a little.  First you look past him, but then you sort of sense he's gentle and kind and worried, and he'll be tender with you.  Nice and sweet.  That's what's really exciting.  If I were your wife, I'd be very very jealous of you.""  Those sentences cheered me up when I first heard them, and made me think, ""Well, maybe I've got it made, even though I don't look like Tom Cruise or Patrick Swayze.""  After all, like Sherman, I thought, no pretty girl in her right mind wants me.The key trends of vegetarian cuisine, the coaxial cable, 50,000,000 TV viewers, and Arthur Godfrey are time capsule elements exemplified in the America of 1955.Tom Ewell, who reprised his role from the George Axelrod play of the same name, must be one lucky actor.  After this movie, he played opposite another blonde, Jayne Mansfield in The Girl Can't Help It.Robert Strauss is funny as Kruhulik the lecherous greasy-looking janitor, who quotes from Porgy and Bess to describe the antics of summer bachelors:  ""Summertime, an' the livin' is easy, when the fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high.""  Doro Merande has a funny line as a waitress whose pro-naturalist camp stance extends to pacifist sentiments.  And Carolyn Jones, best known as Morticia Addams, plays a red-haired nurse smitten by Sherman in an imagination sequence.For me, this is Marilyn's best picture and best character.  I fell in love with her upon first seeing this.  Now, though, I consider her an old friend.  So, calling all the lonely creatures of the lagoon like me out there with great imagination and no esteem.

Sanderman,"[3, 5]","""The Seven Year Itch"" is a wonderful film that opens up with the typical Manhattan family-or rather several of them being sent off to summer vacations while the husbands stay at home to ""play"" once their wives are gone.  The overlying dialogue, provided by a narrator, gives the film instant appeal and is strikingly different than any other film I've ever seen.  The dialogue in this film is very fun and the main character (played by Tom Ewell) has absolutely hilarious fantasies where he imagines himself in all sorts of incredible situations.  One of these fantasies, my favorite in fact, involves Rachmaninoff.Ewell's awkwardness and assuredness that he knows how to woo women is hilarious and strikes a chord in all men's hearts.  He definitely plays to an older crowd-his ideas of dating and romance are wonderfully dated.  One gripe I have of the film is that they show us the picture that Ewell discovers of his upstairs' guest (played by Monroe).  Why do they show us the picture?  The picture would have been better if they had left it up to our imagination.Marilyn Monroe is loveable in this film, though one can get tired of her nave character.  One has to see this film, if only to catch the now famous subway scene involving Monroe and her skirt.  The team who worked on the film did a magnificent job.  The DVD is excellent and the extra features are definitely worth a look.  ""The Seven Year Itch"" is a very funny comedy that manages to appeal to modern audiences.

The movie itself is restored to brilliant color and crisp clearness for the viewer's eye.  The extras were very interesting.  I very much enjoyed the Backstory(from the cable channel AMC).  It helps take the viewer behind the scenes a bit and see a little more than MM's undies.The deleted scenes made me laugh!!! To think what drew the line back in the 1950's as far as censors go!! These were so tame by today's standards.  They are still delightful scenes nonetheless.  They should've been put back onto the entirity of the film for the dvd.The movie itself is just elegant, as MM's character would say.  It's the story of Richard Sherman, played by comedic talent, Tom Ewell.  Marilyn plays &quot;the girl&quot; who gets Mr. Sherman's wild imagination going.  She lives upstairs and when her tomato plant falls over and practically kills him, he invites her down for a drink.  Just a drink...There's much more going on, just check this film out.

It makes you really appreciate all the hard work that Norma Jean put into her character, and how much her acting had matured in a short time. Her comic timing is especially evident here. It made me dream about how she and that other 50's comic icon -- Lucille Ball -- would have made cinematic magic together, with the right story and script.  She is quite frankly a marvel, and the only reason to see this film.  The rest of it is preachy, poorly written, boring, sexist, badly directed, and just embarrassing in contrast to the film's star.

Although because of censorship the film has been severely watered down from the actual play upon which it is based, I still found it thoroughly funny and enjoyable watching Tom Euell's character try to resist the great temptation of cheating on his wife who is away for the holidays.  Marilyn Monroe was very funny in her role and given that she was going through a tough time in real life makes it even a greater achievement to perform at the high levels that she does in this great comedy.  Although she is remembered as a bimbo femme fatale her acting talents should not be overlooked as I thought she was brilliant here and even when she played her small but memorable role in ""All About Eve"" I was very impressed at just how good an actress she was.  Unfortunately, this film was also responsible for her divorce from Joe DiMaggio shortly after.Another great surprise was the quality of this dvd version; the bonus features has a good backstory documentary on the making of the film but more importantly, the picture and sound quality is very good indeed.

315294,AMI0C2C9QS8U3,6302484405,j.,"[6, 15]","Director Billy Wilder's ""The Seven Year Itch"" is a film classic not because of its comedic genius, but because it challenged Hollywood censorship and perpetuated the ""dumb-blonde"" stereotype that plagued Marilyn Monroe's career.  It's not a laugh-out-loud comedy, and is actually very predjudice by today's standards.  ""The Seven Year Itch"" was actually originally a broadway play.  However, when brought to the big screen, it had to be significantly trimmed down both in risky dialogue and subject matter.  In the play, the protagonist has an affair with Marilyn Monroe's character.  In the film, however, there is no affair at all.  Thus, the film is essentially about nothing. A married man flirts with a girl who lives upstairs. But nothing comes of their flirting, so the plot basically fizzles. In addition, the movie contains many monologues that drag, and the acting is very over-the-top.  Still, the film is important to see for anyone interested in Marilyn Monroe's life and career choices.

Ewell has air-conditioning and it happens to be bloody hot in New York, so hot- in fact, that Monroe needs to stick her panties in the freezer and begs Ewell to sit in his apartment to cool off. Oh sure, he lets her in. Wouldn't you?So, his imagination runs away with him, does flips and somersaults, and creates scenarios, which never develop. Monroe is oblivious, just appreciating the kindness of a nice neighbor. There is a scene where he kisses her and says ""Oh my, I am so soooory.  This has never happened to me before!""  And Monroe straitens her stunning ivory dress, runs her fingers through her hair, and confesses, ""Oh, this happens to me all the time!""""The Seven Year Itch"" is a lovely, lush, laughable film.  Nothing sexual happens.  Only a simple kiss. A man in middle-life going through menopause.  A man who comes to the realization that even though Monroe happens to be in his house, he still loves his wife.My favorite scene:  Ewell says, ""No pretty girl would want me. I am old with a little pouch. No pretty girl would want me.""  Monroe disagrees--""How do you know what a pretty girl wants?  She wants to be treated tender. She wants kindness.

Tom Ewell's Richard Sherman uses his powerful imagination to conjure up a whole slew of scenarios--some driven by 'pretend'-lust, some, by paranoia--to depict the colorful mental life of an editor in a small-time publishing office, circa 1955, whose day-to-day existence cries out for adventure.  The presence of Marilyn Monroe is the perfect added ingredient here; he needs SOME objectification to make his fantasies spring to life--and here she is!The comedy here is great and works so well because of Sherman's constant, nervous imagination, fidgeting with scores of images that fly in and out that blow whatever his current situation is way out of proportion, and the leading lady's blithe, intentionally dopey disregard for baser intentions.  The combination of her innocence and obvious sexuality is a really potent one that leads Sherman into all kinds of imagined trouble and a supporting character, played by Robert Strauss, to say upon first glance of her, ""Well, HELLO""--justifiably so.This film is much funnier than many more recent American comedies that take their comedy too seriously--because the writers and/or directors don't have the understanding of how to juxtapose opposites--the mark of any great comedy.

The one where she stands over a subway grating on a hot summer night to feel the rush of cool air from the trains passing beneath---the rush of air blowing the skirt of her sexy white halter dress up around her. But there's a movie that goes with this legendary image and it's a classic. Based on the adult Broadway play, ""Itch"" was watered down for the screen and stars Tom Ewell as the frustrated married man and Monroe as the Girl Upstairs. One hot New York summer, a man sends his wife and small son away for the summer---as all New York men do this time of the year according to Ewells' narration. He's left alone in their apartment to struggle with his vices---cigarettes and booze---when all of a sudden the Girl moves in sub-letting the apartment upstairs. She's a TV model and commercial actress and delightfully portrayed by Monroe. The homely and dumpy Ewell begins having steamy sex fantasies visualizing himself as a powerful lover irrestible to women. Monroe wants to be neighborly so she keeps inviting herself down to his flat frustrating the hopelessly timid Ewell. She doesn't realize her effect on him but he's got an air condtioner and it's hot upstairs. She's completely guileless. Monroe is perfect as the Girl and Ewell personifies the Everyman confronted with temptation when left to his own devices.

Marilyn is so annoying in this I wanted to smack her, and Tom Ewell's character is equally a jerk. I am not sure why this movie was supposed to be funny. Is adultery funny? Not really. I don't mean to sound so conservative, in fact I'm quite the opposite, I'm pretty liberal, which may be why this movie bothered me so much. It is very sexist and dated and Monroe's usual portray of the harmless, stupid, breathy blonde bimbo so eager to please isn't very empowering to young women.

Though &quot;Some like it hot&quot; is much better, the best  comedy ever made, this one has a freshness to it and a sort of underlying  tone which is refering to Monroe's intelligence. Watching her films, you  always feel that she means what she is saying, but in this one, you think  that she knows better than what she is really saying. You feel a sort of  contradiction between what she is saying and what she is thinking. That's a  different Monroe.And what did it for me, was when Tom Ewell tells the man  spending time with his wife, that Marilyn Monroe could be in his kitchen.  I've been wiating all my life to hear this. Whenever a star is in a movie,  you always mention others stars, that have no links what so ever with the  film or the actor.

It's a Marilyn Monroe Classic and a Cinema classic for that matter also. Not just for the famous 'wind blown white dress scene', but also for the clever, tight script and superb direction of Billy Wilder, who always knew how to get the best out of Marilyn. The scenes between Marilyn and Tom Ewell are a pure delight.Ewell plays the tempted,nervous and slightly neurotic middle aged married Man to perfection and of course who else could portray the mixture of flirtatious sexuality and charming childlike naivety of Ewell's young, shapely neighbour for the summer, so beautifully as our Marilyn. She had a quality that was difficult to define and impossible to imitate.There are some very memorable and vintage moments of comic irony and wit in this film. Among my favourites is where Marilyn's character tells Ewell's, that she was embarrassed about being rescued in her bathtub by the plumber(after her toe got caught in the faucet)because she had no toenail polish on. Marilyn's comic delivery and timing are superb in this film, and I think along with being a mega movie star and screen legend, she should be recognized for her talents as a very fine light comedy actress. Though when she pushed herself she could put her stamp on certain dramatic roles too (Bus Stop being the example which always comes to mind).The scenes where the Ewell character's continually overactive imagination takes over, are very amusing and well done and I think he contributes as much to this movie as Marilyn does, in making it a timeless 1950's hollywood classic.

315315,AYU9LBROYQBG6,6302484405,"Noel Serrano ""Gala Foundation http://gfoundat...","[1, 4]","The 1955 film version was co-written and directed by Billy Wilder, and starred Marilyn Monroe and Ewell, reprising his Broadway role. It contains one of the most iconic images of the 20th century-Monroe standing on a subway grate as her dress is blown above her knees by a passing train.Richard Sherman (Tom Ewell) sends his wife Helen (Evelyn Keyes) and son Ricky (Butch Bernard) to Maine to escape the summer heat. When he returns home, he meets The Girl (Marilyn Monroe), a model who is renting the apartment upstairs while she is in town to make television spots for a toothpaste. That evening, while proofing a book by psychiatrist Dr. Brubaker (Oskar Homolka), claiming that a significant proportion of men have extra-marital affairs in the seventh year of marriage, he has an imaginary conversation with Helen, trying to ""convince"" her, in three fantasy sequences, that he is irresistible to women, but she laughs off his assertion. A tomato plant then crashes into his lounge chair; The Girl accidentally knocked it over, and apologizes. Richard invites her to come down for a drink.As he waits for her to put on her underwear that she keeps cool in the refrigerator and gets dressed, Richard has a fantasy that The Girl is a femme fatale overcome by his playing of Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto. While playing Chopsticks (above), Richard, back in his fantasy, grabs The Girl in a bear hug, causing them to fall off the piano bench. She shrugs off it, but he is immediately contrite, and asks her to leave.Over the next few days, they grow closer. His resolve to resist temptation in all of its many forms fuels his fear that he is succumbing to the 'Seven Year Itch'. He seeks out Dr. Brubaker for help, but to no avail. His imagination then kicks into overdrive: Helen and Ricky watch The Girl on TV as she warns the women of New York City about ""this monster named Richard Sherman""; The Girl tells a plumber (Victor Moore) how Richard is ""just like The Creature from the Black Lagoon""; the plumber repeats her story to the horrified patrons of the vegetarian restaurant Richard ate at; the Shermans' hunky neighbour, Tom McKenzie (Sonny Tufts), arranges for he and Helen to be alone on a hayride; a wronged Helen returns home to exact her revenge. The fantasies turn Richard into a paranoid wreck.After a crazed confrontation with McKenzie, whom Helen has asked to drop by to pick up Ricky's canoe paddle, Richard comes to his senses. He tells The Girl she can stay at his apartment, then runs off to catch the next train to Maine.The movie was filmed between September 1 and November 4, 1954, and was the only Wilder film released by 20th Century Fox.The characters of Elaine (Dolores Rosedale}, Marie, and the inner-voices of Sherman and The Girl were dropped; the characters of the Plumber, Miss Finch (Carolyn Jones), the Waitress (Doro Merande), and Kruhulik the janitor (Robert Strauss) were added. Many lines and scenes from the play were cut or re-written because they were deemed indecent by the Hays office. Axelrod and Wilder complained that the film was being made under straitjacketed conditions. This led to a major plot change: in the play, Sherman and The Girl become intimate; in the movie, the romance is all in his head.The footage of Monroe's dress billowing over a subway grate was shot twice: The first take was shot at Manhattan's Lexington Avenue at 52nd Street and the second on a sound stage. The sound stage footage is what made its way into the final film, as the original on-location footage's sound had been rendered useless by the over excited crowd present during filming.Footage of Walter Matthau testing for Sherman is featured in the DVD of the film. Nicolas Roeg's film Insignificance features a character based on Monroe and a re-enactment of the subway/dress scene.",3,MARILYN IS  GORGEOUS!,1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,3821,"['1955', 'film', 'version', 'was', 'co-written', 'directed', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'starred', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Ewell', 'reprising', 'Broadway', 'role', 'one', 'most', 'iconic', 'images', '20th', 'century-Monroe', 'standing', 'subway', 'grate', 'dress', 'blown', 'knees', 'passing', 'train.Richard', 'Sherman', 'Tom', 'Ewell', 'wife', 'Helen', 'Evelyn', 'Keyes', 'son', 'Ricky', 'Butch', 'Bernard', 'Maine', 'escape', 'summer', 'heat', 'When', 'home', 'Girl', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'model', 'who', 'renting', 'apartment', 'upstairs', 'town', 'make', 'television', 'spots', 'toothpaste', 'evening', 'proofing', 'book', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Brubaker', 'Oskar', 'Homolka', 'claiming', 'significant', 'proportion', 'men', 'have', 'extra-marital', 'affairs', 'seventh', 'year', 'marriage', 'imaginary', 'conversation', 'Helen', 'trying', 'convince', 'three', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'irresistible', 'women', 'assertion', 'tomato', 'plant', 'then', 'lounge', 'chair', 'Girl', 'accidentally', 'knocked', 'over', 'apologizes', 'Richard', 'come', 'down', 'drink.As', 'put', 'underwear', 'cool', 'refrigerator', 'dressed', 'Richard', 'fantasy', 'Girl', 'femme', 'fatale', 'overcome', 'playing', 'Rachmaninoff', 'Second', 'Piano', 'Concerto', 'playing', 'Chopsticks', 'Richard', 'back', 'fantasy', 'grabs', 'Girl', 'bear', 'hug', 'causing', 'fall', 'off', 'piano', 'bench', 'shrugs', 'immediately', 'contrite', 'leave.Over', 'next', 'few', 'days', 'grow', 'closer', 'resolve', 'resist', 'temptation', 'many', 'forms', 'fuels', 'fear', 'succumbing', ""'Seven"", 'Year', 'Itch', 'out', 'Dr.', 'Brubaker', 'help', 'avail', 'imagination', 'then', 'overdrive', 'Helen', 'Ricky', 'watch', 'Girl', 'TV', 'women', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'monster', 'named', 'Richard', 'Sherman', 'Girl', 'plumber', 'Victor', 'Moore', 'how', 'Richard', 'just', 'Creature', 'Black', 'Lagoon', 'plumber', 'story', 'horrified', 'patrons', 'vegetarian', 'restaurant', 'Richard', 'ate', 'Shermans', 'hunky', 'neighbour', 'Tom', 'McKenzie', 'Sonny', 'Tufts', 'Helen', 'be', 'alone', 'hayride', 'wronged', 'Helen', 'home', 'exact', 'revenge', 'fantasies', 'turn', 'Richard', 'paranoid', 'wreck.After', 'crazed', 'confrontation', 'McKenzie', 'whom', 'Helen', 'asked', 'drop', 'pick', 'up', 'Ricky', 'canoe', 'paddle', 'Richard', 'senses', 'Girl', 'can', 'stay', 'apartment', 'then', 'catch', 'next', 'train', 'Maine.The', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'September', '1', 'November', '4', '1954', 'was', 'only', 'Wilder', 'film', 'released', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox.The', 'characters', 'Elaine', 'Dolores', 'Rosedale', 'Marie', 'inner-voices', 'Sherman', 'Girl', 'were', 'dropped', 'characters', 'Plumber', 'Miss', 'Finch', 'Carolyn', 'Jones', 'Waitress', 'Doro', 'Merande', 'Kruhulik', 'janitor', 'Robert', 'Strauss', 'were', 'added', 'Many', 'lines', 'scenes', 'play', 'were', 'cut', 're-written', 'were', 'deemed', 'indecent', 'Hays', 'office', 'Axelrod', 'Wilder', 'complained', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'straitjacketed', 'conditions', 'led', 'major', 'plot', 'change', 'play', 'Sherman', 'Girl', 'become', 'intimate', 'movie', 'romance', 'head.The', 'footage', 'Monroe', 'dress', 'billowing', 'subway', 'grate', 'was', 'shot', 'twice', 'first', 'take', 'was', 'shot', 'Manhattan', 'Lexington', 'Avenue', '52nd', 'Street', 'second', 'sound', 'stage', 'sound', 'stage', 'footage', 'what', 'made', 'way', 'final', 'film', 'original', 'on-location', 'footage', 'sound', 'had', 'been', 'rendered', 'useless', 'over', 'excited', 'crowd', 'present', 'filming.Footage', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'testing', 'Sherman', 'featured', 'DVD', 'film', 'Nicolas', 'Roeg', 'film', 'Insignificance', 'character', 'based', 'Monroe', 're-enactment', 'subway/dress', 'scene']",Seven Year Itch VHS

Tom Ewell plays a blundering fool who loses his competence at the very sight of her.

I lived there then.  Ewell's wife and family have gone to the sticks to avoid the summer heat, and Monroe has taken the apartment upstairs.  Ewell's mouth falls open at the scent of her, as he tries to woo her into his--his--he's not sure what, but to his lair, for starters.There's the famous scene of MM standing over the subway grid and having her skirt blow up to reveal her legs.  The giant cutout of that on Times Square revealed more than is revealed in the movie.  It offended Joe DiMaggio, her husband, but it had little to do with the movie.

But that doesn't seem to faze the girl: &quot;Oh, I think that it's wonderful that you're married! Because with a married man, no matter what, he can't ask you to marry him!&quot; Right... but that doesn't mean he can't have a little fun... with his wife away for the summer.Marilyn Monroe and Tom Ewell team up in this delightfully delicious sex farce directed by Billy Wilder. The sizzling script blended with Monroe's hopelessly dazzling appeal set the tone for the story.Richard quickly learns a great deal about his new neighbor: She has posed for U.S. Camera, she appears in commercials for Dazzledent toothpaste (and gets to speak lines, too), and she keeps her undies in the icebox on hot nights.Over the course of the next few weeks, Richard does the neighborly thing by inviting his charming, sexy, hopelessly ditzy neighbor up for a drink, charming her with records of Rock Monanoff: &quot;Is this what they call classical music? I can tell 'cause there's no vocal.&quot; He escorts her to the theater and home again, walking right over a windy subway grate: &quot;Isn't it delicious?&quot; (The image of Monroe with skirts flying over the subway sparked one of the most memorable seconds in film history).At film's end, Richard reluctantly succumbs to pangs of conscience and the girl's own, honest wisdom comes through. Despite the end of the illicit affair, the film is very much worth seeing, for comic scenes busting with laughs, fun, and the most of Marilyn Monroe's sex appeal ever captured on film.

Marilyn Monroe had a vulnerability, a *tragic fragility* spoke directly to the human condition.  Because you can't understand tragedy unless you also understand Marilyn Monroe. ...In his biography, Arthur Miller tells us that Marilyn was able to pick out the orphans in a crowd, she being an orphan herself.  And one believes this, almost as an act of faith.  Whern she's onscreen, regardless of the role, regardless of the quality of the picture: vulnerable and insecure, she has the ability to touch, to pick out in you, in you *your* vulnerabilities, *your* insecurities.In a Nietzchean sense, when you see her onscreen and are, in turn, reminded of her tragic life, you fear for your own tragedy!  Her unbearable defenselessness triggers a thought -- ""Wouldn't it be tragic if *I* was that defenseless!""What other actress was or is capable of doing that?There were and are many, many actresses, especially in Marilyn's day, who tried to ""get across"" on screen what Marilyn got across.  And none of them even came close.When Marilyn speaks to the Tom Ewell character, the Everyman of the movie, she's speaking to every male in the audience - handsome or homely; smart or dumb; single or married; rich, poor or somewhere in the middle. ... Jayne Mansfield couldn't do that.  Marlene Dietrich couldn't do that.  Rita Hayworth couldn't do that.  Angelina Jolie can't do that.  Cameron Diaz can't do that. ... Not-even-close.When daVinci painted a gloved hand, even though he didn't paint the hand in the glove, he wanted to know about the hand: its structure, its anatomy.  In other words, he wanted to know what *moved* the glove. ... Knowing her life, knowing her tragedy, as just about everyone does, this is always in the audiences' mind when they see Marilyn Monroe onscreen -- what *moved* her, what was just below the surface.  Ultimately, it's impossible to know that in a person, especially a complex, talented, sensitive person.  But Marilyn gives us so many tantalizing clues!  So many theories, so many ... possibilities.And they all go back, I believe, to her ""orphan roots."" ... How does an orphan deal with the adult world? ... How do we all deal with an adult world? ... What makes us so unfit for living?We are all, at heart, orphans.  And Marilyn is there (put there by God or fate or random nature) to remind us of that.Here's a question for you.  Was that certain-something Marilyn Monroe ""had"" inescapably tied up with her physical beauty?  Put another way: would she have lost what she had were she to have lived into her 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s?  I could be wrong but I don't think so.  As she grew older, her orphan-mentality would have been even more perceptive, more instinctive, more heartbreaking.  Assuming she got to play serious roles, she could have been the greatest beauty + the greatest actress ever to appear in front of an audience.You can't take your eyes off her!  Men want to protect her, and  rage against those who took advantage of her.  And so do women.If the studios who exploited Marilyn had given her half of what she earned for them, she could have bought every square inch of downtown Los Angeles.As for ""The Seven Year Itch,"" this movie is humorous in the truest sense of the word, because to be truly humorous, to have a sense of *humor,* one must also have a sense of *humanity,* and that equation, more than anything, is what Marilyn Monroe captured in her comedic performances.She relates to the Tom Ewell character not simply as a sex object (as some reviewers here mistakenly think), but in a true and human way.  Another less-talented actress could have easily turned Tom Ewell's ""inner most thoughts"" into something crude and dirty, but Marilyn never did that, not in any of her movies.  Her natural, spontaneous *celebration* of sexuality is, at its heart, the celebration we feel when we ""connect with others,"" when we discover someone doing exaclty what we're doing -- trying to figure out how, childlike, we can deal with the adult world.That connection was Marilyn Monroe.",5,Not Just a Candle in the Wind ...
