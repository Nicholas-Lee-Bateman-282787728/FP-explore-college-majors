1257963,AFVROUVTT63XM,B002A5J2GQ,"Dr. H. A. Jones ""Howard Jones""","[3, 3]","The plot of this 1953 Warner Brothers movie is a slight variation on that of Hit The Deck or On The Town. The three sailors in question are Gordon Macrae, Gene Nelson and comedian Jack Leonard and the girl, Jane Powell. Powell plays song-and-dance hopeful Penny Weston who is being `managed' for a Broadway show by producer Joe Woods (Sam Levene). The three sailors get an unexpected month's shore-leave while their ship gets a refit. Instead of spending all their back pay on booze and dames, Choirboy Jones (Gordon Macrae) persuades the crew to invest their money. Their investment however turns out to be a Broadway flop, only turned around from disaster by producer George Abbott, stage book writer Moss Hart and lyricist Ira Gershwin, all making cameo appearances as themselves. Paul Burke and Burt Lancaster also make one-shot cameo appearances.I didn't time it but my impression in watching this again was that there was more song and dance and less dialogue than in most musicals I have seen recently. The tunes were supplied by Sammy Fain and Sammy Cahn, who also doubled as producer. The choreography was by LeRoy Prinz and Gene Nelson. I have always rated Gene Nelson's singing and dancing as good as that of Gene Kelly, though he is less well-known. The music in the film was played by Ray Heindorf and the Orchestra. The only song to survive independently of the film was `Face to face', sung in the movie by Jane Powell, but Gordon Macrae's recording became a minor hit for him. Powell and Macrae together sang `There must be a reason', `My heart is a singing heart', and a Strauss waltz that was reworked to appear as `When it's love'. Jack Leonard's role was rather like that of Stubby Kaye in Guys and Dolls as a quite adept singing and dancing comedian. Overall, the film gave us 90 minutes of almost non-stop singing and dancing.",5,3 Sailors and a Girl - the movie,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,1848,"['plot', '1953', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'movie', 'slight', 'variation', 'Hit', 'Deck', 'Town', 'three', 'sailors', 'question', 'are', 'Gordon', 'Macrae', 'Gene', 'Nelson', 'comedian', 'Jack', 'Leonard', 'girl', 'Jane', 'Powell', 'Powell', 'song-and-dance', 'hopeful', 'Penny', 'Weston', 'who', 'being', 'managed', 'Broadway', 'show', 'producer', 'Joe', 'Woods', 'Sam', 'Levene', 'three', 'sailors', 'get', 'unexpected', 'month', 'shore-leave', 'ship', 'refit', 'Instead', 'spending', 'back', 'pay', 'booze', 'dames', 'Choirboy', 'Jones', 'Gordon', 'Macrae', 'crew', 'invest', 'money', 'investment', 'however', 'out', 'be', 'Broadway', 'flop', 'only', 'turned', 'around', 'disaster', 'producer', 'George', 'Abbott', 'stage', 'book', 'writer', 'Moss', 'Hart', 'lyricist', 'Ira', 'Gershwin', 'making', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'Paul', 'Burke', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'also', 'make', 'one-shot', 'cameo', 'appearances.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'time', 'impression', 'watching', 'again', 'was', 'was', 'more', 'song', 'dance', 'less', 'dialogue', 'most', 'musicals', 'have', 'seen', 'recently', 'tunes', 'were', 'supplied', 'Sammy', 'Fain', 'Sammy', 'Cahn', 'who', 'also', 'doubled', 'producer', 'choreography', 'was', 'LeRoy', 'Prinz', 'Gene', 'Nelson', 'have', 'always', 'rated', 'Gene', 'Nelson', 'singing', 'dancing', 'as', 'good', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'less', 'well-known', 'music', 'film', 'was', 'played', 'Ray', 'Heindorf', 'Orchestra', 'only', 'song', 'survive', 'independently', 'film', 'was', 'Face', 'face', 'sung', 'movie', 'Jane', 'Powell', 'Gordon', 'Macrae', 'recording', 'became', 'minor', 'hit', 'Powell', 'Macrae', 'together', 'sang', 'must', 'be', 'reason', 'heart', 'singing', 'heart', 'Strauss', 'waltz', 'was', 'reworked', 'appear', 'When', 'love', 'Jack', 'Leonard', 'role', 'was', 'rather', 'Stubby', 'Kaye', 'Guys', 'Dolls', 'quite', 'singing', 'dancing', 'comedian', 'Overall', 'film', 'gave', '90', 'minutes', 'almost', 'non-stop', 'singing', 'dancing']",Three Sailors & A Girl
1257964,A2GZVA22WYG95I,B002A5J2GQ,J. Olsen,"[8, 8]","Though credibility is stretched if you think about the plot too long and hard (or not even that long), this is a fun musical romp with powerhouse singing talents Jane Powell and Gordon MacRae, along with the incredible hoofing of Gene Nelson. Another ""sailor on shore leave"" storyline has MacRae entrusted with investing the accrued backpay of his fellow sailors on a submarine, which amounts to $50,000.00. As he and his friends, Nelson and comic Jack E. Leonard, carry the duffel bag full of money to the bank they encounter Jane Powell and her slick-talking manager getting tossed out after attempting to get the bank to invest in their show. Smitten by Powell, MacRae is soon convinced to invest their cash in the show (it doesn't hurt that the manager tells him it is a show about the Navy, which it isn't). The cast is currently rehearsing in a parking garage, for lack of funds to hire a hall. Chaos ensues as the manager tries to keep the sailors from discovering the truth about the show before it actually opens. The garage owner wants their show out of his place, the lead actor is a temperamental ham, the costume company wants payment with a check that doesn't bounce, etc. Initially the show is a flop, but with the help of George Abbott, Ira Gershwin and Moss Hart (and the U.S. Marine Corp.) there is hope for success. Through it all Powell and MacRae have an on-again-off-again relationship going, and when they get together for a song they truly make beautiful music together.On the imdb site there seemed to be disagreement as to the source of the story--whether it was based on a George S. Kaufman play or was a remake of the Jimmy Stewart/Eleanor Powell 1944 production ""Born to Dance"". Though the two movies do share the idea of sailors on leave and a young entertainer trying to be in a show, the similarities end there. In the screen credits for this movie it states that it is based on a story by George S. Kaufman. I think that is pretty clear.Presented in full screen 1.33:1, with absolutely no extras (not even scene selection), this DVD-R from the WB Archive Collection is for play in ""play only"" devices. If your player is a player recorder this most likely won't work. Good visual clarity and sound, I don't believe there was anything done to ""remaster"" the print, as there is an occasional imperfection, but it doesn't appear to have been  a bad print to begin with.I enjoy this movie because I really like the two main leads and I've always wanted to see more of Gene Nelson. It is not the best any of the leads have done, so it wouldn't be one of my top picks, but if you are hungry for more from some of your favorites, as I was, this will be a pleasant watching experience and I can recommend it as such.[...]",4,"Nonsensical, musical fun",1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,2745,"['credibility', 'stretched', 'think', 'plot', 'too', 'long', 'hard', 'not', 'even', 'long', 'fun', 'musical', 'romp', 'powerhouse', 'singing', 'talents', 'Jane', 'Powell', 'Gordon', 'MacRae', 'incredible', 'hoofing', 'Gene', 'Nelson', 'sailor', 'shore', 'leave', 'storyline', 'MacRae', 'entrusted', 'investing', 'accrued', 'backpay', 'fellow', 'sailors', 'submarine', '50,000.00', 'friends', 'Nelson', 'comic', 'Jack', 'E.', 'Leonard', 'carry', 'duffel', 'bag', 'full', 'money', 'bank', 'encounter', 'Jane', 'Powell', 'slick-talking', 'manager', 'getting', 'tossed', 'out', 'attempting', 'get', 'bank', 'invest', 'show', 'Smitten', 'Powell', 'MacRae', 'soon', 'convinced', 'invest', 'cash', 'show', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'manager', 'show', 'Navy', ""n't"", 'cast', 'currently', 'rehearsing', 'parking', 'garage', 'lack', 'funds', 'hire', 'hall', 'Chaos', 'manager', 'keep', 'sailors', 'discovering', 'truth', 'show', 'actually', 'garage', 'owner', 'show', 'place', 'lead', 'actor', 'temperamental', 'ham', 'costume', 'company', 'payment', 'check', ""n't"", 'bounce', 'etc', 'Initially', 'show', 'flop', 'help', 'George', 'Abbott', 'Ira', 'Gershwin', 'Moss', 'Hart', 'U.S.', 'Marine', 'Corp.', 'hope', 'success', 'Powell', 'MacRae', 'have', 'on-again-off-again', 'relationship', 'going', 'when', 'get', 'together', 'song', 'truly', 'make', 'beautiful', 'music', 'imdb', 'site', 'there', 'seemed', 'be', 'disagreement', 'source', 'story', 'was', 'based', 'George', 'S.', 'Kaufman', 'play', 'was', 'remake', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart/Eleanor', 'Powell', '1944', 'production', 'Born', 'Dance', 'two', 'movies', 'do', 'share', 'idea', 'sailors', 'leave', 'young', 'entertainer', 'trying', 'be', 'show', 'similarities', 'end', 'there', 'screen', 'credits', 'movie', 'based', 'story', 'George', 'S.', 'Kaufman', 'think', 'pretty', 'clear.Presented', 'full', 'screen', '1.33:1', 'absolutely', 'extras', 'not', 'even', 'scene', 'selection', 'DVD-R', 'WB', 'Archive', 'Collection', 'play', 'play', 'only', 'devices', 'player', 'player', 'recorder', 'most', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'Good', 'visual', 'clarity', 'sound', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'anything', 'done', 'remaster', 'print', 'occasional', 'imperfection', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'print', 'begin', 'with.I', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'really', 'two', 'main', 'leads', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'Gene', 'Nelson', 'not', 'best', 'leads', 'have', 'done', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'one', 'top', 'picks', 'are', 'hungry', 'more', 'favorites', 'was', 'will', 'be', 'pleasant', 'watching', 'experience', 'can', 'recommend', 'such.', '[', ']']",Three Sailors & A Girl

His idea sounds sensible, and soon he has charge of $50,000 worth of sailor pay, all waiting to be invested and duplicated.Once ashore, three of the sailors go to an investment broker, who is desperately trying to get away from the pressures of a musical producer who wants him to invest in his show. After being kicked out of the office, the producer yells in the lobby that the broker is under investigation, causing the sailors to second guess their plans. They soon find themselves investing in the show instead, because all of them are under the spell of the leading lady (Jane Powell).Powell and Gene Nelson are the reasons to watch this movie. Powell is strikingly beautiful and it's a wonder that audiences ever tired of her. Her voice is clear and lovely to hear in song after song. Nelson's dancing is superb and earns him third billing.

Wait till you hear Jane sing 'Ya better Kiss Kiss Kiss Kiss Me or I'll Scream'.  Its histerical.
