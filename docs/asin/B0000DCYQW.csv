It has the same premise ole dead ALIEN on an ancient world that all it wants is to kill. It does not make it!

It has decent acting and convincing settings. There are harsh conditions successfully portrayed- ironically with too dim photography and low lighting in certain scenes (imagine how turbulent conditions would be on some planets) but this is a well-intended effect and not because, as some viewers claim, it might be a low-budget B movie.  There is lots of edgy friction between the astronauts and scary suspense. Several mishaps put together including a surprise appearance of Klaus Kinsky which is set in another angle to the story happen to the crew that seem impossible to cope with in this show and holds the audience in tension. There is a scene which eerily and graphically, but appropriately, emphasizes one of the female astronaut's physique reflecting on the bizarre circumstances and occurrences happening in this unstable atmosphere of Saturn's moon.  Movies like this one often times succeed in making space and technology appear as believable and authentic as a story by a science reporter tries to be.  Creature is probably an underrated, and so under-appreciated, film for this science fiction genre.  It is a film very much worthy of your trying out!",3,Monster in Space attempt to thrill!,1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,1362,"['show', 'audience', 'honest', 'attempt', 'crisis-type', 'movie', 'Airport', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'Earthquake', 'outer', 'space', 'where', 'imitate', 'only', 'degree', 'Aliens', 'theme', 'decent', 'acting', 'convincing', 'settings', 'are', 'harsh', 'conditions', 'successfully', 'portrayed-', 'ironically', 'too', 'dim', 'photography', 'low', 'lighting', 'certain', 'scenes', 'imagine', 'how', 'turbulent', 'conditions', 'would', 'be', 'planets', 'well-intended', 'effect', 'not', 'because', 'viewers', 'claim', 'might', 'be', 'low-budget', 'B', 'movie', 'lots', 'edgy', 'friction', 'astronauts', 'scary', 'suspense', 'Several', 'mishaps', 'put', 'together', 'including', 'surprise', 'appearance', 'Klaus', 'Kinsky', 'set', 'angle', 'story', 'happen', 'crew', 'seem', 'impossible', 'cope', 'show', 'audience', 'tension', 'scene', 'eerily', 'graphically', 'appropriately', 'one', 'female', 'astronaut', 'physique', 'reflecting', 'bizarre', 'circumstances', 'occurrences', 'happening', 'unstable', 'atmosphere', 'Saturn', 'moon', 'Movies', 'one', 'often', 'succeed', 'making', 'space', 'technology', 'appear', 'believable', 'authentic', 'story', 'science', 'reporter', 'tries', 'be', 'Creature', 'probably', 'underrated', 'so', 'under-appreciated', 'film', 'science', 'fiction', 'genre', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'worthy', 'trying', 'out']",N/A

I was happy to add it to my collection because it has an element to it that separated it from others, in that not only is there a alien with a nasty attitude but it can reanimate the people it kills and make them just as nasty.  Even though the acting here is admittedly not the greatest in the world, it's still a good creepy scifi/horror movie and I recommend it just for the creep effect.  Side note:  They redesigned the artwork for this DVD, I wish they would've left it alone, it looked good enough as it was.  -kd5-",5,Good creepy SciFi/Horror movie,1287532800,"10 20, 2010",2010,629,"[""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'counter', '1', '2', 'star', 'reviews', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'happy', 'add', 'collection', 'element', 'separated', 'others', 'not', 'only', 'there', 'alien', 'nasty', 'attitude', 'can', 'reanimate', 'people', 'make', 'just', 'nasty', 'Even', 'acting', 'here', 'admittedly', 'not', 'greatest', 'world', 'still', 'good', 'creepy', 'scifi/horror', 'movie', 'recommend', 'just', 'creep', 'effect', 'Side', 'note', 'redesigned', 'artwork', 'DVD', 'wish', 'would', ""'ve"", 'left', 'alone', 'looked', 'good', 'enough', 'was', '-kd5-']",N/A
778184,A1UHBYL8Y2G9R9,B0000DCYQW,"russianimp ""Ed""","[2, 2]","When people call movies like this a ""ripoff"" of the 1979 film Alien, I have to assume they haven't watched all that many films. This science fiction piece shares a lot more in common with The Thing, Solaris or even 1980's Without Warning than it does Alien. The original 50s version of The Thing is even referenced in the film. However, the fact that it is kind of a jumbled mess of other, more popular movies is the reason I'd say it's a good, but not great film. Klaus Kinski is some kind of weird, perverted scientist or engineer, but whatever position he holds in the German crew he is under utilized as he was in many films. You will probably notice most of the other actors as well and they all turn in a decent performance, so if you're looking for something ""cheezy"" this might not be what you're thinking of. Unfortunately we don't ever really get a good look at the 'Creature', but I honestly don't think that detracts from the film due to other obstacles. There are some interesting zombie like scenes, when the alien takes over the bodies of the people it has killed and those work as a better menace than the actual creature does. There is also a decent amount of blood and the director makes a nice effort to combine blood splatters with lightning strikes on the moon for some spectacular looking shots. The blood and gore definitely isn't overdone, but it did add some nice contrasts to the rather dark film which has a lot of blues, blacks and grays coloring the ships and the Saturnian moon. With the touches of blood and lightning, I would also compare Creature to a classic haunted house flick and in the end that's what I believe the makers of this film were shooting for. The movie is nicely paced and it is this pacing that keeps the tension up, where you will wonder who will survive if anyone at all? At 97 minutes the film isn't too long, but if you're looking for a non-stop action movie then this isn't for you. In the end, Creature holds it's own in a world of films where if they took place in space they were automatically called a steal from Star Wars or Alien. What's funny is I wonder if the people who call several 80s horror in space movies ""Alien ripoffs"" know that Alien is basically a remake of 1958's It The Terror From Beyond Space? Looking for some fun, horrific sci-fi give Creature a look. Strangely there are about a dozen different versions on Amazon to choose from, I just went with the cheapest...wait, were those Star Wars blaster sound effects in the background of this film?",4,NOT An Alien Ripoff,1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,2524,"['When', 'people', 'call', 'movies', 'ripoff', '1979', 'film', 'Alien', 'have', 'assume', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'many', 'films', 'science', 'fiction', 'piece', 'shares', 'lot', 'more', 'common', 'Thing', 'Solaris', 'even', '1980', 'Warning', 'Alien', 'original', '50s', 'version', 'Thing', 'even', 'referenced', 'film', 'However', 'fact', 'kind', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'other', 'more', 'popular', 'movies', 'reason', ""'d"", 'say', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'Klaus', 'Kinski', 'kind', 'weird', 'perverted', 'scientist', 'engineer', 'position', 'German', 'crew', 'utilized', 'was', 'many', 'films', 'will', 'probably', 'notice', 'most', 'other', 'actors', 'well', 'turn', 'decent', 'performance', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'cheezy', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'what', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'really', 'get', 'good', 'look', ""'Creature"", 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'due', 'other', 'obstacles', 'are', 'interesting', 'zombie', 'scenes', 'when', 'alien', 'bodies', 'people', 'killed', 'work', 'better', 'menace', 'actual', 'creature', 'also', 'decent', 'amount', 'blood', 'director', 'nice', 'effort', 'combine', 'blood', 'splatters', 'lightning', 'strikes', 'moon', 'spectacular', 'looking', 'shots', 'blood', 'gore', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'overdone', 'did', 'add', 'nice', 'contrasts', 'rather', 'dark', 'film', 'lot', 'blues', 'blacks', 'grays', 'coloring', 'ships', 'Saturnian', 'moon', 'touches', 'blood', 'lightning', 'would', 'also', 'compare', 'Creature', 'classic', 'haunted', 'house', 'flick', 'end', 'what', 'believe', 'makers', 'film', 'were', 'shooting', 'movie', 'nicely', 'paced', 'pacing', 'tension', 'up', 'where', 'will', 'wonder', 'who', 'will', 'survive', 'anyone', '97', 'minutes', 'film', ""n't"", 'too', 'long', ""'re"", 'looking', 'non-stop', 'action', 'movie', 'then', ""n't"", 'end', 'Creature', 'own', 'world', 'films', 'where', 'took', 'place', 'space', 'were', 'automatically', 'called', 'steal', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Alien', 'What', 'funny', 'wonder', 'people', 'who', 'call', 'several', '80s', 'horror', 'space', 'movies', 'Alien', 'ripoffs', 'know', 'Alien', 'basically', 'remake', '1958', 'Terror', 'From', 'Beyond', 'Space', 'Looking', 'fun', 'horrific', 'sci-fi', 'give', 'Creature', 'look', 'Strangely', 'are', 'dozen', 'different', 'versions', 'Amazon', 'choose', 'just', 'went', 'cheapest', 'wait', 'were', 'Star', 'Wars', 'blaster', 'sound', 'effects', 'background', 'film']",N/A
