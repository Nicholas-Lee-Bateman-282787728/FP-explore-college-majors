388683,AFZU6XDO5L75R,6303920721,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[0, 0]","This little film is a bit different and it's pretty well done. I really can't complain about the quality in sound, video, clarity, casting and so on. All those things are quite good. I was a little bored with it however. It struggles to hold your attention long enough to get it's message out. It does have a great ending which is a very nice change, and there are a lot of guys in it, several of which were very pleasing to the eyes. It's all about one guys journey to the fast paced, one night stand after another all summer long in the ultimate gay party spot of Provincetown. He is looking for fun, or so he thinks, but he might just find something a whole lot more satisfying within his own heart. This guy has a problem being majorly shallow. The film is not all that immune from the same disorder, but both seem to make an amazing recovery in the end. In fact, the film makes a nice point in the ending if you can stay with it long enough to get that far. It's got some low spots to endure, but this film really does have a few high spot that make it worth watching. While most of the content is not my personal cup of tea and some of it was just not really worth watching at all for me, I can't honestly say it's a bad film. It's not by any means a blockbuster, and not one I will be watching over and over again. I would recommend this one to a select group of gays who are into the party life of sex and drugs. Those will find it most entertaining. If you are not into that sort of thing, You, as I, will be more comfortable watching something else. There are a whole lot better movies out there to choose from in my humble opinion. Nevertheless, I give this one three stars. One for the quality, one for casting and acting, and the other for the ending which doesn't just leave you hanging and feeling like you got nothing at all out of your time viewing it. I would recommend a lot of other films over this one, BUT if you are determined to watch it, just keep expectations low, and consider your own feelings about the subject matter.",3,"He who lies down with dogs, gets fleas",1179360000,"05 17, 2007",2007,2047,"['little', 'film', 'bit', 'different', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'quality', 'sound', 'video', 'clarity', 'casting', 'so', 'things', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'was', 'little', 'bored', 'however', 'hold', 'attention', 'long', 'enough', 'get', 'message', 'out', 'have', 'great', 'ending', 'very', 'nice', 'change', 'are', 'lot', 'guys', 'several', 'were', 'very', 'pleasing', 'eyes', 'one', 'guys', 'journey', 'fast', 'paced', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'summer', 'long', 'ultimate', 'gay', 'party', 'spot', 'Provincetown', 'looking', 'fun', 'so', 'might', 'just', 'find', 'something', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'satisfying', 'own', 'heart', 'guy', 'problem', 'being', 'majorly', 'shallow', 'film', 'not', 'immune', 'same', 'disorder', 'seem', 'make', 'amazing', 'recovery', 'end', 'fact', 'film', 'nice', 'point', 'ending', 'can', 'stay', 'long', 'enough', 'get', 'far', 'got', 'low', 'spots', 'endure', 'film', 'really', 'have', 'few', 'high', 'spot', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'most', 'content', 'not', 'personal', 'cup', 'tea', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'ca', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'say', 'bad', 'film', 'not', 'means', 'blockbuster', 'not', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'select', 'group', 'gays', 'who', 'are', 'party', 'life', 'sex', 'drugs', 'will', 'find', 'most', 'entertaining', 'are', 'not', 'sort', 'thing', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'comfortable', 'watching', 'something', 'else', 'are', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'movies', 'there', 'choose', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Nevertheless', 'give', 'one', 'three', 'stars', 'One', 'quality', 'one', 'casting', 'acting', 'other', 'ending', ""n't"", 'just', 'leave', 'hanging', 'feeling', 'got', 'nothing', 'time', 'viewing', 'would', 'recommend', 'lot', 'other', 'films', 'one', 'BUT', 'are', 'determined', 'watch', 'just', 'keep', 'expectations', 'low', 'consider', 'own', 'feelings', 'subject', 'matter']",Lie Down With Dogs VHS
388684,AIWDJ3S85O10Q,6303920721,Edward Aycock,"[20, 31]","This is, quite simply, one of the most shallow, pathetic and depressing films I have ever seen. What's even worse, it operates under the guise of a fun beach movie.  Granted, I may be gay but am not one of those club going,  circuit party, drinking guys who seem to drift through life in pursuit of  good clothes and sharp wisecracks, and watching this film makes me even  more secure in who I am. First off, this was filmed during off-season  apparently, which gives Provincetown the look of a ghost town.  One expects  to see tumbleweed drifting through the streets in the establishing shots.  Secondly, the poor misguided hero leaves New York because he is sick of it  and the people (at least, that is what I can gather from the badly acted  prologue...the friends the hero wants to get away from seem to have stepped  out of a gay Fellini film...one without subtitles) So, our plucky hero goes  to Provincetown, and instead of convincing us how wonderful it is, we come  away with a bad taste in our mouths. One of his new best friends is an  alcoholic who does not help him when he is sick, we are supposed to root  for our hero at the end when the guy he likes ends up going with another  man, and then we have the Randy Becker character who is a dangerous  combination of pulchritude and stupidity (but then after watching this  film, it begs the question...are brains and beauty mutually exclusive?) The  worst thing about this film, besides the shallowness and charisma factors  of zero in just about every character is how genuinely unfunny it is. Jokes  fall flat...and if we are supposed to think jokes about older men (i.e.  responsible) in AA are funny, then I suggest you check this film out. Me? I  tend not to.  I much prefer Boys in the Band, which, despite all its hard  knocks seems to be more universally reviled due to its truthfulness. Lie  down with Dogs is not a great, liberating film.

388685,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6303920721,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[3, 6]","LIE DOWN WITH DOGS was reasonably popular with gay audiences for about fifteen minutes in 1995, but God only knows why.  A more abrasive set of overworked stereotypes can scarcely be imagined.Tommy (Wally White) arrives in Provincetown with no money, no job, no place to stay, and grandiose ideas of the good times to be had at a gay-popular summer destination.  Needless to say, one misadventure follows another: lecherous would-be employers, pot-smoking landlords, a snaky Latin lover more interested in Tommy's cigarettes than in Tommy himself.  But the film is a great deal less interesting than it sounds.In theory, LIE DOWN WITH DOGS satirizes the youthful gay party scene.  In practice, however, it plays out in the manner of a particularly charmless Saturday morning cartoon.  Written and directed by Wally White himself, the film seems to exist chiefly in order to showcase just how relentlessly unfunny and aggressively obnoxious White can be.Now and then an occasional supporting player, a script idea, or a line of dialogue sparks the film to life--but such moments are too few and too far between to jolt this dog to life.

388686,A3KLCX1XYL9821,6303920721,Glenn_from_CT,"[0, 4]","I'll be blunt: there are a lot of really bad independent gay-themed films out there... this one is, quite simply, the worst.It's one thing to produce a low-budget film that features bad acting, a bad screenplay, bad camerawork and bad editing.  This film has all of that but goes way beyond, to include bad jokes, a bad message and some really, REALLY bad stereotypes that are entirely offensive.The fault here falls squarely on the shoulders of writer/director/actor/narcissist Wally White.  His goal here was to create a whimsical, light-hearted diary of someone's (presumably his, considering how insanely vain this vanity project is) stint as a houseboy in the resort town of Provincetown, Massachusetts.  And, of course, White cast himself as the lovable stud at the center point of the ""story"" (I use quotes because there really isn't one here.)  The problem is that White is neither lovable nor studly.  He isn't funny, either.  In fact, White - with his protruding belly and nasally delivery - is so gratingly UNlikeable that it's nearly astonishing to watch.Even worse, White makes it clear that anyone who isn't like him - an airheaded gym-bunny party-boy born to dance the night away - is somehow inferior.  The worst example of this heartless and condescending behavior comes when White's character of Tommie imparts his ""Square State"" theory... in a crowded dance club, he points out to a friend all the substandard men he can find and notes that, because of their sheer inferiority, they must be from some hideously unchic, square-shaped state.  The fact that White even thinks this is funny just makes it all the more shocking.Look, as a minority, gays and lesbians incur enough criticism from outside our world; the fact that one of our own could dish out the same kind of loathing from within our own community is unfathomable.  It shrieks of insecurity, insensitivity and everything that's wrong with the gay subculture.  And even if White somehow meant it to be a send-up of this behavior (and trust me, he didn't), it still isn't entertaining in the least.Do not, under any circumstances, waste your time with this movie.  I really don't want to have to say ""told ya so.""",1,Beyond Bad,1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,2191,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'blunt', 'are', 'lot', 'really', 'bad', 'independent', 'gay-themed', 'films', 'there', 'one', 'quite', 'simply', 'worst.It', 'one', 'thing', 'produce', 'low-budget', 'film', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'screenplay', 'bad', 'camerawork', 'bad', 'editing', 'film', 'way', 'include', 'bad', 'jokes', 'bad', 'message', 'really', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'entirely', 'offensive.The', 'fault', 'here', 'squarely', 'shoulders', 'writer/director/actor/narcissist', 'Wally', 'White', 'goal', 'here', 'was', 'create', 'whimsical', 'light-hearted', 'diary', 'someone', 'presumably', 'considering', 'how', 'insanely', 'vain', 'vanity', 'project', 'stint', 'houseboy', 'resort', 'town', 'Provincetown', 'Massachusetts', 'course', 'White', 'cast', 'lovable', 'stud', 'center', 'point', 'story', 'use', 'quotes', 'really', ""n't"", 'one', 'here', 'problem', 'White', 'lovable', 'studly', ""n't"", 'funny', 'either', 'fact', 'White', 'protruding', 'belly', 'nasally', 'delivery', 'so', 'gratingly', 'UNlikeable', 'nearly', 'astonishing', 'watch.Even', 'worse', 'White', 'clear', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'airheaded', 'gym-bunny', 'party-boy', 'born', 'dance', 'night', 'away', 'somehow', 'inferior', 'worst', 'example', 'heartless', 'condescending', 'behavior', 'when', 'White', 'character', 'Tommie', 'Square', 'State', 'theory', 'crowded', 'dance', 'club', 'out', 'friend', 'substandard', 'men', 'can', 'find', 'notes', 'sheer', 'inferiority', 'must', 'be', 'hideously', 'unchic', 'square-shaped', 'state', 'fact', 'White', 'even', 'funny', 'just', 'more', 'shocking.Look', 'minority', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'incur', 'enough', 'criticism', 'world', 'fact', 'one', 'own', 'could', 'dish', 'out', 'same', 'kind', 'loathing', 'own', 'community', 'unfathomable', 'insecurity', 'insensitivity', 'everything', 'wrong', 'gay', 'subculture', 'even', 'White', 'somehow', 'meant', 'be', 'send-up', 'behavior', 'trust', 'did', ""n't"", 'still', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'least.Do', 'not', 'circumstances', 'waste', 'time', 'movie', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'say', 'told', 'ya', 'so']",Lie Down With Dogs VHS
388687,AEV640MKB3I9J,6303920721,Hank Drake,"[8, 13]","Lie Down with Dogs ran through the independent film circuit in 1995, and was forgotten as soon as the run was over, with good reason.The plot centers around a shallow, self-centered gay man who can't handle the pressure of summer in New York, and decides on a whim to spend the summer in Provincetown, Massachusetts.First of all, this film is not an honest portrayal of Provincetown--except for during the last reel when the main character, Tommy, takes a bike tour through the nature trails with Ben--who appears to be the only decent guy in town.  In reality, Provincetown is much more idyllic than is shown here-and there are lots of nice, genuine people there.  Not that the town doesn't party hearty, but that's far from the only reason gays & lesbians choose this as a prime vacation spot.  (The town's extensive history as an artist's colony isn't even mentioned.)  Matters are not helped by the fact that the film, which takes place during the summer, was shot in the off-season when the streets were nearly empty.Second, the movie is a slanderous portrayal of gay life.  In one monologue, White belittles Longtime Companion, but that film is far more realistic, moving, and does greater service to the gay community.Wally White is obviously the primary force behind this film, since he's listed as producer, writer, director, and lead actor.  So the blame for this drivel falls entirely on his shoulders.  As producer, it's astonishing he was able to secure funding for his poorly written tripe.  As director, he can't handle a camera, nor does he have an eye for cinematography--Provincetown looks better in the photos I took during a trip there.  As actor, he gives the worst performance in the film.  It says something about the overall quality of this film that, with the exception of Randy Becker (who was already an established stage actor by the time this film was released) none of the other principals has been heard from since--including Wally White.I can't help the feeling that Wally White's primary motivation in making this film was to act out love scenes with numerous good looking guys who would be out of his league in real life.Two stars due to the fact that this movie at least inspired me to visit the real Provincetown.",2,The Title Says it All...,1074297600,"01 17, 2004",2004,2249,"['Lie', 'Down', 'Dogs', 'ran', 'independent', 'film', 'circuit', '1995', 'was', 'forgotten', 'as', 'soon', 'run', 'was', 'over', 'good', 'reason.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'shallow', 'self-centered', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'pressure', 'summer', 'New', 'York', 'whim', 'spend', 'summer', 'Provincetown', 'Massachusetts.First', 'film', 'not', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'Provincetown', 'last', 'reel', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'Tommy', 'bike', 'tour', 'nature', 'Ben', 'who', 'be', 'only', 'decent', 'guy', 'town', 'reality', 'Provincetown', 'much', 'more', 'idyllic', 'shown', 'here-and', 'are', 'lots', 'nice', 'genuine', 'people', 'there', 'Not', 'town', ""n't"", 'party', 'hearty', 'far', 'only', 'reason', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'choose', 'prime', 'vacation', 'spot', 'town', 'extensive', 'history', 'artist', 'colony', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'Matters', 'are', 'not', 'helped', 'fact', 'film', 'place', 'summer', 'was', 'shot', 'off-season', 'when', 'streets', 'were', 'nearly', 'empty.Second', 'movie', 'slanderous', 'portrayal', 'gay', 'life', 'one', 'monologue', 'White', 'Longtime', 'Companion', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'moving', 'greater', 'service', 'gay', 'community.Wally', 'White', 'obviously', 'primary', 'force', 'film', 'listed', 'producer', 'writer', 'director', 'lead', 'actor', 'blame', 'drivel', 'entirely', 'shoulders', 'producer', 'astonishing', 'was', 'able', 'secure', 'funding', 'poorly', 'written', 'tripe', 'director', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'camera', 'have', 'eye', 'cinematography', 'Provincetown', 'better', 'photos', 'took', 'trip', 'there', 'actor', 'worst', 'performance', 'film', 'something', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'exception', 'Randy', 'Becker', 'who', 'was', 'already', 'established', 'stage', 'actor', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'none', 'other', 'principals', 'been', 'heard', 'including', 'Wally', 'White.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'Wally', 'White', 'primary', 'motivation', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'act', 'out', 'love', 'scenes', 'numerous', 'good', 'looking', 'guys', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'league', 'real', 'life.Two', 'stars', 'due', 'fact', 'movie', 'least', 'inspired', 'visit', 'real', 'Provincetown']",Lie Down With Dogs VHS
