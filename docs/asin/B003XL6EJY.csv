1370712,A3V3CTB2Y7UKRG,B003XL6EJY,Christopher Pelletier,"[0, 0]","Motion comics have been around for a good while now.  One of the most interesting from the past was The Maxx, which used the limited animation as a sort of style.  This Iron Man film is interesting because they were able to maintain that comic feel but they went to extra steps to pace it more like a film.  I also like how the rendered 3D parts are all skinned to look just like the book.  It blends a lot  better then you would imagine.  It's funny the animation is actually better then the more recent Marvel Knights releases.  A lot of it probably has to do with how it was drawn and the art transitioning to motion a lot better.  It looks clean though with no jagged edges and lip syncing is smooth.The voice acting is good and of course so is the story.  It's interesting to watch in wake of the Iron Man film series.  You can see that almost all the key moments in those films came from this storyline.  It's hard to imagine this is one of Marvel's first motion comics.  My major complaint is the DVD itself.  On the new releases everything has chapters, this doesn't.  You have to fast forward the 30 second intro every episode which is a little annoying.  The special features are okay but a little long.  I feel like they could have cut the interview with the artist down a bit.  He was humble at first but as it went on he started to sound pretentious.

Basically, you could say it was the beginning to a mini reboot of the Iron Man franchise back in 2004. Interestly enough, the Extremis story is still relevant today. That said, I really enjoyed Warren Ellis' story. In fact, I wish he would have remained the writer for Iron Man beyond these six issues.

Yes. The art is good. This was true in the comic as well.

Wow, what a difference. Remember, this is a motion comic, not a typical animated feature. I have purchased all of Marvel's and DC's motion comics and this one is the one to beat. The animation is incredible; so detailed. The story is very good, too along with the voice acting. I love Spider-Woman: Agent of Sword too but the voice acting suffers on that one. Also there is no lip synching. Only the X-Men and this one have lip synching. I hope they do more of this kind of entertainment.

1370718,AZ505YQE7561U,B003XL6EJY,"J. Maines ""Web developer""","[1, 1]","I always liked comics, but motion comics add music and sound effects, which are hard to get from reading a comic.  Motion comics also have some fairly nice voice acting sometimes, but Extremis is not a good example.  I found most of the acting in this fairly weak.  That said, the writing did not allow much room for emotional acting. Everything was centered on violence and action, which would be fine with me if it was more animated and had the nice eye candy to match.Extremis is not animated well, but as far as motion comics are concerned, it is above average.  The story is from a 2004 comic, and it is more like an end-game situation than a continuing story.  Once you see the end of this, you will wonder if they made Iron Man too powerful.  While the final boss battle is pretty epic, I think this story would be hard to keep going in an interesting way.  My biggest complaint would be that the story is broken down into extremely short videos or episodes.  It would be more enjoyable if I didn't have to watch the intro credits animation every few minutes, and that intro is extremely long for how short the episodes are. The amount of people involved in this is crazy!Pros of Extremis:1. Iron Man is awesome.2. The comic art is beautiful.3. The music is pretty good.4. The story allows a lot of violence.5. The story wraps up nicely.Cons of Extremis:1. Iron Man whines about his own technology too much.2. The animations are very ugly most of the time.3. Nowhere near as good as the Astonishing X-Men animations!4. The intro is extremely long and annoyingly repetitive.5. The overall plot makes very little sense.

If you are wondering if you should make the purchase, please hesitate no longer. My interest in Iron Man: Extremis came as a result of seeing the motion comic on iTunes, and the phrase ""motion comic"" was instantly new to me. What I didn't know at the time was that what you see in the motion comic comes directly from the pages of the graphic novel 'Iron Man: Extremis,' and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU PURCHASE the graphic novel FIRST! That way, reading the fantastic work of Warren Ellis & seeing the exquisite artwork of Adi Granov prepares for THE EXPERIENCE of what this particular motion comic does in setting the bar for others that would follow. Motion comics are comic books or graphic novels that were not originally intended for animation, and attempts to bring it to an audience ""live"" through the motions normally created through the traditional medium of animation. Certainly, the story and artwork are undoubtedly a powerful combination I have rarely witnessed. The interview with artist Adi Granov on this DVD explains it beautifully. At the time, I could not recall where I enjoyed a storyline and artwork together more.

Great artwork, acting, and a story line that was up there with the best despite being somewhat lacking in the mystery department. That last comment may be somewhat unfair as these are not meant to be mysteries and Tony Stark doesn't play detective a la the Caped Crusader. It's just  my way of thinking; if there's going to be a ""who done it?"" aspect to a story it is fair to offer a critique of that aspect as well...Definitely a worthy effort and I am not one to throw 5 Stars at something that didn't earn it.

1370726,A3BW9ENHAN5ILP,B003XL6EJY,ReubenR,"[29, 33]","This Iron Man DVD is a ""motion comic"" from Marvel Knights. They have taken the Extremis comic and turned it into a quasi-animated movie in six episodes. Before you discount this style of animation, note that the artwork is far superior to any of the other Marvel/DC ""animated movies"" (which all seem to look like slightly better versions of Cartoon Network cartoons) because it utilizes Adi Granov's original artwork with CGI enhancements of most of the tech and action scenes. The animation is fluid, and after only a few minutes you won't even realize you're not watching a fully-animated Marvel movie.The strength of this DVD is Warren Ellis' storyline, which is more compelling than any recent comic book movie, except for perhaps The Dark Knight and the first Iron Man movie. This motion comic is unpredictable, hard-core, and exciting.My only complaint about this DVD was N. Ronald Levine, who voiced the character of hippie Sal Kennedy - what a horrible casting choice! The scenes with Levine take you right out of the movie as you roll your eyes at the bad acting. Luckily, he's not in the movie much except for one scene in the middle.If you're like me, every time you buy one of these Marvel or DC animated movies, you look at the cover art and eagerly hope that the product itself utilizes that same level of artistic expertise, only to discover that it's another Cartoon Network-looking piece of crap. But with Iron Man: Extremis, you finally get to see a full story with top-notch painted animation - and it's worth it!I'm glad I gave this product a chance...and you will be too.",4,Motion comic sets a very high bar,1291507200,"12 5, 2010",2010,1592,"['Iron', 'Man', 'DVD', 'motion', 'comic', 'Marvel', 'Knights', 'have', 'taken', 'Extremis', 'comic', 'turned', 'quasi-animated', 'movie', 'six', 'episodes', 'discount', 'style', 'animation', 'note', 'artwork', 'far', 'superior', 'other', 'Marvel/DC', 'animated', 'movies', 'seem', 'look', 'slightly', 'better', 'versions', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'cartoons', 'Adi', 'Granov', 'original', 'artwork', 'CGI', 'enhancements', 'most', 'tech', 'action', 'scenes', 'animation', 'fluid', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', ""'re"", 'not', 'watching', 'fully-animated', 'Marvel', 'movie.The', 'strength', 'DVD', 'Warren', 'Ellis', 'storyline', 'more', 'compelling', 'recent', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movie', 'motion', 'comic', 'unpredictable', 'hard-core', 'only', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'was', 'N.', 'Ronald', 'Levine', 'who', 'voiced', 'character', 'hippie', 'Sal', 'Kennedy', 'what', 'horrible', 'casting', 'choice', 'scenes', 'Levine', 'take', 'right', 'movie', 'roll', 'eyes', 'bad', 'acting', 'Luckily', 'not', 'movie', 'much', 'one', 'scene', 'middle.If', ""'re"", 'time', 'buy', 'one', 'Marvel', 'DC', 'animated', 'movies', 'look', 'cover', 'art', 'eagerly', 'hope', 'product', 'same', 'level', 'artistic', 'expertise', 'only', 'discover', 'Cartoon', 'Network-looking', 'piece', 'crap', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Extremis', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'full', 'story', 'top-notch', 'painted', 'animation', ""'m"", 'glad', 'gave', 'product', 'chance', 'will', 'be', 'too']",Marvel Knights: Iron Man - Extremis

It's another variation of the oft attempted super-soldier serum.  Tony Stark tries to clean up the mess after it's successfully applied to a human trial, but the human is a bit unhinged.  Weaving through the story are threads about Stark being called to task as this utopian who makes and sells weapons (the hypocritical bashnick) and a techno-babble futurist talking head that looks like Jerry Garcia from the Grateful Dead who just techno-psycho-babbles.  It was annoying.Anyway, for anyone not familiar with motion comics I would urge them to start elsewhere for a variety of reasons.  Start with Astonishing X-Men: Gifted or Thor & Loki: Blood Brothers.  If you start with Extremis you may become extremely opinionated against motion comics and you'd miss some potentially enjoyable stuff.",3,"After hearing so much about the vaunted ""Extremis"" storyline I was disappointed.",1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,1496,"['Perhpas', 'disappointment', 'high', 'expectations', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'great', 'fantastic', 'story', 'felt', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'perhaps', 'stark', 'get', 'art', 'direction', 'devoid', 'full', 'cinematic', 'feeling', ""n't"", 'translate', 'well', 'here', 'especially', 'motion', 'comic', 'format', 'perhaps', 'animation', 'company', 'doing', 'motion', 'comics', 'Marvel', 'had', ""n't"", 'hit', 'stride', 'yet', 'maybe', 'combination', 'three', 'was', 'net', 'effect', 'entertainment', 'left', 'feeling', 'cold.The', 'storyline', 'Extremis', 'nutshell', 'injection', 'virus', 'human', 'host', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'living', 'weapon', 'variation', 'oft', 'attempted', 'super-soldier', 'serum', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'clean', 'up', 'mess', 'successfully', 'applied', 'human', 'trial', 'human', 'bit', 'unhinged', 'Weaving', 'story', 'are', 'threads', 'Stark', 'being', 'called', 'task', 'utopian', 'who', 'weapons', 'hypocritical', 'bashnick', 'techno-babble', 'futurist', 'talking', 'head', 'Jerry', 'Garcia', 'Grateful', 'Dead', 'who', 'just', 'techno-psycho-babbles', 'was', 'annoying.Anyway', 'anyone', 'not', 'familiar', 'motion', 'comics', 'would', 'urge', 'start', 'elsewhere', 'variety', 'reasons', 'Start', 'Astonishing', 'X-Men', 'Gifted', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'Blood', 'Brothers', 'start', 'Extremis', 'may', 'become', 'extremely', 'opinionated', 'motion', 'comics', ""'d"", 'miss', 'potentially', 'enjoyable', 'stuff']",Marvel Knights: Iron Man - Extremis
