978682,A19ATJSKDZD9EZ,B000EU1Q0Y,"Adam Stapleton ""drunken sailor""","[3, 7]","I watched this DVD a couple years ago and thought it was phenomenal and very interesting, even despite the fact that the majority of UFO photos it cuts to throughout it's length are composed mostly of Billy Meier created pictures. All of Meier's famous photos were proven to be fakes and hoaxes long ago, why Aykroyd and Sereda chose to litter their DVD with so many proven fakes is beyond me. It certainly doesn't do anything to support their argument for the existance of UFO's.At this point I want to make it clear to the readers of this review that I am a firm believer that UFO's do in fact exist, what they are, I do not know for sure, but you won't find the answer to that question in this DVD.Instead, if you watch this DVD, you will be treated to Aykroyd waxing scientific about his thoughts on UFO's, extraterrestrial technology and why his abismal television show Sci-Factor was canceled (he believes the men in black had something to do with it rather than the fact that the show just kind of sucked) all while chain smoking camel cigarettes.Entertaining to say the least, however it doesn't really do much to advance the study of what UFO's are and where they come from.Another major point of contention is the fact that Sereda and Aykroyd harp constantly on the alleged NASA UFO footage, most of which had already been debunked, and the most compelling of which was 100% proved to be false in a recent episode of UFO Hunters on the History Channel.These facts put the majority of Sereda's investigations into question, and while I like the guy and admire his passion for getting to the truth, I fear that his tendency to believe everything he sees and take things at face value, skews his objectivity and hence puts into question all of his theories and findings.From what I understand, Aykroyd has been working on a sequel to Unplugged on UFO's in which he will unveil supposed footage of the recent mass sighting at the Chicago O'Hare Airport. If this is true, then it might warrant a deeper look, but this DVD does not.In the end, this DVD is worth a rental, but not a purchase, and doesn't really have much to offer the serious UFO investigator in the way of information or truth.",1,Debunked,1210636800,"05 13, 2008",2008,2198,"['watched', 'DVD', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'very', 'interesting', 'even', 'fact', 'majority', 'UFO', 'photos', 'length', 'are', 'composed', 'mostly', 'Billy', 'Meier', 'created', 'pictures', 'Meier', 'famous', 'photos', 'were', 'proven', 'be', 'fakes', 'hoaxes', 'long', 'ago', 'why', 'Aykroyd', 'Sereda', 'chose', 'litter', 'DVD', 'so', 'many', 'proven', 'fakes', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'support', 'argument', 'existance', ""UFO's.At"", 'point', 'want', 'make', 'clear', 'readers', 'review', 'am', 'firm', 'believer', 'UFO', 'do', 'fact', 'exist', 'what', 'are', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'answer', 'question', 'DVD.Instead', 'watch', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'Aykroyd', 'waxing', 'scientific', 'thoughts', 'UFO', 'extraterrestrial', 'technology', 'why', 'abismal', 'television', 'show', 'Sci-Factor', 'was', 'canceled', 'men', 'black', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'rather', 'fact', 'show', 'just', 'kind', 'sucked', 'chain', 'smoking', 'camel', 'cigarettes.Entertaining', 'say', 'least', 'however', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'much', 'advance', 'study', 'what', 'UFO', 'are', 'where', 'come', 'from.Another', 'major', 'point', 'contention', 'fact', 'Sereda', 'Aykroyd', 'harp', 'constantly', 'alleged', 'NASA', 'UFO', 'footage', 'most', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'debunked', 'most', 'compelling', 'was', '100', '%', 'proved', 'be', 'false', 'recent', 'episode', 'UFO', 'Hunters', 'History', 'Channel.These', 'put', 'majority', 'Sereda', 'investigations', 'question', 'like', 'guy', 'admire', 'passion', 'getting', 'truth', 'fear', 'tendency', 'believe', 'everything', 'take', 'things', 'face', 'value', 'skews', 'objectivity', 'hence', 'question', 'theories', 'findings.From', 'what', 'understand', 'Aykroyd', 'been', 'working', 'sequel', 'Unplugged', 'UFO', 'will', 'unveil', 'supposed', 'footage', 'recent', 'mass', 'sighting', 'Chicago', ""O'Hare"", 'Airport', 'true', 'then', 'might', 'warrant', 'deeper', 'look', 'DVD', 'not.In', 'end', 'DVD', 'rental', 'not', 'purchase', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'offer', 'serious', 'UFO', 'investigator', 'way', 'information', 'truth']",Dan Aykroyd Unplugged On Ufo's

They call his attention to it and say ""did you see that?""  The space walking astonaut replies he doesn't see anything and asks what they are talking about and they lie to him and say it was just a lens cap that came loose, ""nothing to worry about"". There's no sense in causing alarm in a man in a space suit tethered to his space capsule by a thin cable, by letting him know a UFO is hovering near him.Dan Akroyd is to be commended for putting his beliefs in UFO's out there and letting the world see that he gives this subject serious thought.

978684,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000EU1Q0Y,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[12, 14]","This is quite an odd video - not for the subject matter so much as for the style of presentation.  According to filmmaker David Sereda, he was so fascinated by a UFO-related conversation he had with actor Dan Aykroyd that he just had to interview him in front of the cameras, and this video is basically a conversation between the two about a range of issues related to UFO phenomena.  Apparently, Aykroyd has long been interested in the subject and had recently interviewed a number of prominent ufologists for his own UFO-related show for Sci-Fi (before the series was abruptly and mysteriously cancelled before it ever made it to air).  Aykroyd, it's important to note, does not pretend to be a scientist or an expert (even though Sereda bills him as one of the greatest minds on earth), and he really doesn't have any vast truths to communicate - he's just, like so many of us, fascinated and well-read on the subject, a believer who wants to push the UFO debate more firmly into public awareness.The production quality of the actual interview leaves something to be desired.  I think both men were there facing each other, but the shots of Sereda show him against a white background while Aykroyd looms in front of a shadowy background, with all manner of strange close-ups and camera angles of him interspersed throughout.  To my eyes, at least, the presentation sometimes takes on the look of a mockumentary, especially when Aykroyd lights up a cigarette.Since the topics cover a wide range of issues, from space shuttle sightings to alien abduction to parallel dimensions to Men in Black and beyond, you almost need to have at least a basic background in the history of UFOs and alien literature to put some of what is discussed in a proper context.  On the other hand, the conversational tone of the presentation may appeal to the uninitiated much more than a dry, scientific discussion ever could.  Those of us who consider ourselves armchair ufologists may not gain a lot out of the discussion at all, as it mainly focuses on familiar sightings, events, and speculation.  Some of the newer UFO videos presented here may prove interesting, as I saw several clips I had never seen before, but none of them are in any way explosive -there's really no substantive evidence of any kind on display here.  I also think the filmmakers made a big mistake by including a significant number of Billy Meier photos - sure, these are some of the clearest UFO photographs ever taken, but the vast majority of ufologists view Billy Meier's ""evidence"" as thoroughly bogus.Basically, I have to go down the middle on this one.  You need to be able to put a lot of the subject matter in its proper context in order to closely follow the conversation, yet those who know enough to do just that probably won't glean a lot of new information from the presentation.  In addition, the fact that many of the same videos and photographs are replayed several times over the course of the production gets a little annoying.",3,Dan Aykroyd says the truth is out there,1159315200,"09 27, 2006",2006,3005,"['quite', 'odd', 'video', 'not', 'subject', 'matter', 'so', 'much', 'style', 'presentation', 'According', 'filmmaker', 'David', 'Sereda', 'was', 'so', 'fascinated', 'UFO-related', 'conversation', 'had', 'actor', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'just', 'had', 'interview', 'front', 'cameras', 'video', 'basically', 'conversation', 'two', 'range', 'issues', 'related', 'UFO', 'phenomena', 'Apparently', 'Aykroyd', 'long', 'been', 'interested', 'subject', 'had', 'recently', 'interviewed', 'number', 'prominent', 'ufologists', 'own', 'UFO-related', 'show', 'Sci-Fi', 'series', 'was', 'abruptly', 'mysteriously', 'cancelled', 'ever', 'made', 'air', 'Aykroyd', 'important', 'note', 'not', 'pretend', 'be', 'scientist', 'expert', 'even', 'Sereda', 'bills', 'one', 'greatest', 'minds', 'earth', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'vast', 'truths', 'communicate', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'fascinated', 'well-read', 'subject', 'believer', 'who', 'push', 'UFO', 'debate', 'more', 'firmly', 'public', 'awareness.The', 'production', 'quality', 'actual', 'interview', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'think', 'men', 'were', 'there', 'facing', 'other', 'shots', 'Sereda', 'show', 'white', 'background', 'Aykroyd', 'front', 'shadowy', 'background', 'manner', 'strange', 'close-ups', 'camera', 'angles', 'interspersed', 'eyes', 'least', 'presentation', 'sometimes', 'look', 'mockumentary', 'especially', 'when', 'Aykroyd', 'up', 'cigarette.Since', 'topics', 'cover', 'wide', 'range', 'issues', 'space', 'shuttle', 'sightings', 'alien', 'abduction', 'parallel', 'dimensions', 'Men', 'Black', 'almost', 'need', 'have', 'least', 'basic', 'background', 'history', 'UFOs', 'alien', 'literature', 'put', 'what', 'discussed', 'proper', 'context', 'other', 'hand', 'conversational', 'tone', 'presentation', 'may', 'appeal', 'uninitiated', 'much', 'more', 'dry', 'scientific', 'discussion', 'ever', 'could', 'who', 'consider', 'armchair', 'ufologists', 'may', 'not', 'gain', 'lot', 'discussion', 'mainly', 'familiar', 'sightings', 'events', 'speculation', 'newer', 'UFO', 'videos', 'presented', 'here', 'may', 'prove', 'interesting', 'saw', 'several', 'clips', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'none', 'are', 'way', 'explosive', 'really', 'substantive', 'evidence', 'kind', 'display', 'here', 'also', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'big', 'mistake', 'including', 'significant', 'number', 'Billy', 'Meier', 'sure', 'are', 'clearest', 'UFO', 'photographs', 'ever', 'taken', 'vast', 'majority', 'ufologists', 'view', 'Billy', 'Meier', 'evidence', 'thoroughly', 'bogus.Basically', 'have', 'go', 'down', 'middle', 'one', 'need', 'be', 'able', 'put', 'lot', 'subject', 'matter', 'proper', 'context', 'order', 'closely', 'follow', 'conversation', 'yet', 'who', 'know', 'enough', 'do', 'just', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'glean', 'lot', 'new', 'information', 'presentation', 'addition', 'fact', 'many', 'same', 'videos', 'photographs', 'are', 'replayed', 'several', 'times', 'course', 'production', 'little', 'annoying']",Dan Aykroyd Unplugged On Ufo's

We like Aykroyd using his celebrity status to bring the UFO phenomena to the talking tables, (it sure is more sincere than weight-loss programs, and orphaned African children), but his rather unconvincing account of a 'men in black' encounter, and his lung polluting, chain smoking cigarettes inhaled into his very overweight rotund figure, while discussing how the U.S. Government is destroying the world's natural environment, verges on SNL satire.",1,THE X-LAX FILES,1178496000,"05 7, 2007",2007,918,"['more', 'unplugged', 'completely', 'uninvolved', ""'Laid"", 'back', 'tone', 'video', 'would', 'like', 'convey', 'interviewer', 'UFO', 'researcher', 'David', 'Sereda', 'subject', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'are', 'so', 'casual', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'discussing', 'who', 'won', 'Mets', 'game', 'difficult', 'discuss', 'such', 'fantastic', 'subjects', 'striking', 'nerve', 'somewhere', 'documentary', 'just', 'seeming', 'more', 'intent', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'normal', 'dull', 'paranormal', 'believer', 'can', 'be', 'like', 'Aykroyd', 'using', 'celebrity', 'status', 'bring', 'UFO', 'phenomena', 'talking', 'tables', 'sure', 'more', 'sincere', 'weight-loss', 'programs', 'orphaned', 'African', 'children', 'rather', 'unconvincing', 'account', ""'men"", 'black', 'encounter', 'lung', 'polluting', 'chain', 'smoking', 'inhaled', 'very', 'overweight', 'rotund', 'figure', 'discussing', 'how', 'U.S.', 'Government', 'destroying', 'world', 'natural', 'environment', 'verges', 'SNL', 'satire']",Dan Aykroyd Unplugged On Ufo's

Listening to the interview made it clear that aliens exist and that the government knows about them. They discussed what Dan would do if he could travel back in time and he was asked who he would talk to.

They even had a chance to work in an ironic bit, worthy of the best of SNL: Dan postulates on an alien's ability to detect degenerated atmosphere due to human excess....while he takes a drag on the ol' cancer stick.Yes, one of the worst inventions on terra-firma, one symbolising all kinds of devolution, physical, social, economic distress is highlighted right along with Ackroyd's well-fed kisser.Not that he isn't a genius.Having said all that: for about 9.99 this isn't bad at all: as I wrote, a Dan fan, will have a field day - they'll appreciate his heartfelt, emotional, intellectualizing; for the UFO package completist, there appears to be a ton of rare footage.And what of that footage: not one frame is analyzed - it's all backdrop for Dan's impressive, obviously researched, ramblings. Like, there's no party-pooper tech.-head to say, well, those three lights keeping pace with the jet are probably reflections off the instrument panel; and the bobbing up and down disc appears to be something meterological; the thing that looks like a mile-long cigar tube...that's really a reflection off a microscopic chip either in the windshield or the camera lens.The host is very complimentary of his guest...well, that's okay, he expresses genuine joy that this superstar seemed so happy to let himself be taped for a project from an up and coming occult documentary maker.Sometimes that genuine emotion can lead to questions like, Dan, if you could time travel back, where would you go and what would you do. Dan's answer is actually brilliant - you know, remove one maniac and someone replaces him/her, but then here it comes: he'd want a casual confab with Dr. Al (I guess to explain to him that he should have anticipated quarks).",3,For fans of DA: ****; for UFO buffs: ** = ***,1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,1808,"['Yes', 'really', 'fans', 'Dan', 'A.', 'not', 'one', 'mirthful', 'moment', 'even', 'had', 'chance', 'work', 'ironic', 'bit', 'worthy', 'best', 'SNL', 'Dan', 'alien', 'ability', 'detect', 'degenerated', 'atmosphere', 'due', 'human', 'excess', 'drag', 'ol', 'cancer', 'stick.Yes', 'one', 'worst', 'inventions', 'terra-firma', 'one', 'symbolising', 'kinds', 'devolution', 'physical', 'social', 'economic', 'distress', 'highlighted', 'right', 'Ackroyd', 'well-fed', 'kisser.Not', ""n't"", 'genius.Having', 'said', 'about', '9.99', ""n't"", 'bad', 'wrote', 'Dan', 'fan', 'will', 'have', 'field', 'day', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'heartfelt', 'emotional', 'intellectualizing', 'UFO', 'package', 'completist', 'be', 'ton', 'rare', 'footage.And', 'what', 'footage', 'not', 'one', 'frame', 'analyzed', 'backdrop', 'Dan', 'impressive', 'obviously', 'researched', 'ramblings', 'party-pooper', 'tech.-head', 'say', 'well', 'three', 'lights', 'keeping', 'pace', 'jet', 'are', 'probably', 'reflections', 'instrument', 'panel', 'bobbing', 'up', 'down', 'disc', 'be', 'something', 'meterological', 'thing', 'mile-long', 'cigar', 'tube', 'really', 'reflection', 'microscopic', 'chip', 'windshield', 'camera', 'lens.The', 'host', 'very', 'complimentary', 'guest', 'well', 'okay', 'genuine', 'joy', 'superstar', 'seemed', 'so', 'happy', 'let', 'be', 'taped', 'project', 'up', 'coming', 'occult', 'documentary', 'maker.Sometimes', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'can', 'lead', 'questions', 'Dan', 'could', 'time', 'travel', 'back', 'where', 'would', 'go', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'Dan', 'answer', 'actually', 'brilliant', 'know', 'remove', 'one', 'maniac', 'someone', 'replaces', 'him/her', 'then', 'here', ""'d"", 'want', 'casual', 'confab', 'Dr.', 'Al', 'guess', 'explain', 'should', 'have', 'anticipated', 'quarks']",Dan Aykroyd Unplugged On Ufo's

I'm just an ignorant musician, not an astrophysicist. But then again, neither is Dan Aykroyd.As Dan himself said, he is an entertainer and the purpose of this documentary is to entertain.... OK, it WAS entertaining.But I doubt that I'm any closer to believing ALL the hoopla about UFOs coming to earth than I was before. Neither do I buy (whole hog) into every account, photograph or rumor regarding abductions, contacts etc.... However, I do believe that there could easily be people from other planets who may have visited here... I also believe in the possibility that SOME people's abduction accounts might actually be true.There's just so much rabidity generated from the subject that it invites every fame seeker, money grubber and certified whacko to crawl out of the woodwork each time the subject gets some fresh notoriety.... For example, idiots like Rael who claim extraterrestrial origins in order to attract followers to their stupidass, mind numbed cults. Does any right thinker on the planet follow blindly behind these morons....? Hell no.... But I digress....I disgaree with producer/author/director David Sereda's assertion that having a conversation about UFOs with Dan Aykroyd is anything at all like speaking with Albert bloody Einstein.... This star struck little twit needs to remain BEHIND the camera. Every time he opens his mouth something really frickin' stupid comes out of it.....But all things considered, some of the photo and film work was entertaining..... Some of the interviews were thought provoking... The Astronaut Cooper stuff was quite revealing... particularly the fact that Cooper himself spoke as if he actually IS being controlled by aliens....No kiddin'...It's spooky.All in all the DVD is entertaining if you can get past all the aforementioned silliness....In all honesty, I must admit that the film does make a stronger statement for the existence of real space invaders than any other film of it's kind that I've seen....and Aykroyd himself is by no means a prophet of an ""all aliens are our friends"" philosophy.... He raises the ""benevolent vs: malevolent"" issue with great frequency...and his ""Men in Black"" account is really cool....What the hell, if yer fascinated with all this UFO stuff, buy the DVD...
