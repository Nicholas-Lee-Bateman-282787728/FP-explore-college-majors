It was a great story because of the importance, and putting the story in the form of a movie helps the public see some of the things that could happen when information is withheld.  The acting was good as I was not familiar with anyone in this movie.",4,"Surprise, surprise, surprise!",1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,368,"['was', 'story', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'experienced', 'finding', 'out', 'relative', 'closer', 'blood', 'think', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'importance', 'putting', 'story', 'form', 'movie', 'public', 'see', 'things', 'could', 'happen', 'when', 'information', 'withheld', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'movie']",N/A

While I never saw any of them, I know Robert Englund played Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddie Kruger. I have seen Patricia Kalember in a few other movies, but also as television's Doctor Kay O'Brien. Dick O'Neil has certainly been in a lot of movies, but I remember him most in Wolfen. This movie about a young woman so controlled by her violent husband is about her and his imprisonment after being found guilty of first degree murder. Based on a real event, I was surprised how much he could control her in prison, until her sister got her to see what had been happening to her and her young daughter and help her find the strength she needs to prove her innocence and break free from her husband's control.
