276385,A14CLM6MITNDM8,6301965825,B. Wilson,"[2, 2]","I love Nelson Eddy & Jeanette MacDonald together, so I was prepared to be disappointed in this movie where his co-star is Rise Stevens.  However, from the very beginning, the plot catches the viewer and it just gets funnier and funnier as it goes on.Karl Lang (Nelson Eddy) and Maria Lanyi (Rise Stevens) are a successful husband and wife stage team.  The problem in their relationship?  Maria is an overtly flirtatious woman who had numerous men in her life before she married and Karl is a nail-biting, insecure and extremely jealous husband.  He's convinced his replacement in her affections is just around the next corner.As a test of her faithfulness, he uses his acting and stage makeup knowledge to assume a disguise as Vassily Vassilievitch Varonofsky, an impressive Russian who agressively attempts to seduce Maria.  Unbeknownst to Karl, Maria quickly concludes her suitor is really Karl and she sets about teaching him a lesson by tormenting him with her hot and cold behavior toward Vassily.  Karl's reactions to her mixed signals are hysterical and both stars play their roles perfectly.  The supporting cast is very capable, especially Nigel Bruce, who plays their mutual friend Bernard.It goes without saying that two stars with operatic backgrounds have fantastic voices and Nelson & Rise display them to great advantage in some wonderful songs like ""My Hero"" and ""Forgive"".  Anyone who ever thought Nelson Eddy couldn't act or was wooden in his performance must watch this one.  Not only is his comic timing terrific, he performs the ""Song of the Flea"" with some very funny antics.This one is a must for any Nelson Eddy fan and I heartily recommend it for anyone who loves comedy.  There's no way to watch it without laughing.",5,Hilarious from start to finish,1236729600,"03 11, 2009",2009,1742,"['love', 'Nelson', 'Eddy', 'Jeanette', 'MacDonald', 'together', 'was', 'prepared', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'where', 'co-star', 'Rise', 'Stevens', 'However', 'very', 'beginning', 'plot', 'viewer', 'just', 'funnier', 'funnier', 'on.Karl', 'Lang', 'Nelson', 'Eddy', 'Maria', 'Lanyi', 'Rise', 'Stevens', 'are', 'successful', 'husband', 'wife', 'stage', 'team', 'problem', 'relationship', 'Maria', 'overtly', 'flirtatious', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'numerous', 'men', 'life', 'married', 'Karl', 'nail-biting', 'insecure', 'extremely', 'jealous', 'husband', 'convinced', 'replacement', 'affections', 'just', 'next', 'corner.As', 'test', 'faithfulness', 'acting', 'stage', 'makeup', 'knowledge', 'assume', 'disguise', 'Vassily', 'Vassilievitch', 'Varonofsky', 'impressive', 'Russian', 'who', 'agressively', 'seduce', 'Maria', 'Unbeknownst', 'Karl', 'Maria', 'quickly', 'suitor', 'really', 'Karl', 'teaching', 'lesson', 'tormenting', 'hot', 'cold', 'behavior', 'Vassily', 'Karl', 'reactions', 'mixed', 'signals', 'are', 'hysterical', 'stars', 'play', 'roles', 'perfectly', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'capable', 'especially', 'Nigel', 'Bruce', 'who', 'mutual', 'friend', 'Bernard.It', 'saying', 'two', 'stars', 'operatic', 'backgrounds', 'have', 'fantastic', 'voices', 'Nelson', 'Rise', 'display', 'great', 'advantage', 'wonderful', 'songs', 'Hero', 'Forgive', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'thought', 'Nelson', 'Eddy', 'could', ""n't"", 'act', 'was', 'wooden', 'performance', 'must', 'watch', 'one', 'Not', 'only', 'comic', 'timing', 'terrific', 'Song', 'Flea', 'very', 'funny', 'antics.This', 'one', 'must', 'Nelson', 'Eddy', 'fan', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'comedy', 'way', 'watch', 'laughing']",N/A

However this movie is silly.  The plot is implausible even for an operetta derived work.  The production numbers are derivative of earlier musicals.  The best way to appreciate this movie, as far as I am concerned, is to put on a blindfold and fast forward to the musical numbers.  Both Stevens and Eddie are in fine voice, though in some of the close ups they look very bored.  The image is very soft, the blacks are more gray than black.  However the print is clean and free of distortion.

This light operatta has one beautiful number after another with my favorite song &quot;My hero&quot;.
