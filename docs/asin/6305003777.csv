443512,A3PF2NF7LX3CAB,6305003777,"Dan Seitz ""cinnatusc""","[4, 4]","Truthfully, I'm not sure what the other reviews are complaining about: ""Tokyo Fist"" is arguably more coherent than ""Tetsuo"", although it's hardly a finely tuned plot.  Nor are the goings-on more extreme than in ""Tetsuo.""  The tattoos and piercings are not ""ritual""; in fact, they're pretty direct self-mutilation and alteration.  I really don't understand why this is slapped with ""Warning: Adult Content"" labels, because frankly, the American cinema has seen much worse.The ""Fight Club"" paralells people draw are also very misleading; first of all, the plots are nothing alike.  This is more similar to ""Tetsuo"" than anything else.  Second, this is in terms of direction simply a better film.  It's obvious Tsukamoto sat down and thought hard about how exactly he wanted each shot to be presented, whereas David Fincher tried to assault the senses by NOT thinking.  It's not as digestible to American audiences, but them's the breaks.Tsukamoto's distinct directorial style (there's even a little stop-motion here) is better defined here, especially his use of color.  His ""video game"" style is very much present here, and while it's not for everyone, if you're interested in being challenged, it's probably for you.  It's also a good lead-in to ""Tetsuo"", although the same warning there applies here: if you haven't sampled of David Cronenberg, David Lynch and a few other ""perverse"" filmmakers, I'd step carefully.",4,"It's not ""Tetsuo"", but good on its own merits",1015459200,"03 7, 2002",2002,1416,"['Truthfully', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'complaining', 'Tokyo', 'Fist', 'arguably', 'more', 'coherent', 'Tetsuo', 'hardly', 'finely', 'tuned', 'plot', 'are', 'goings-on', 'more', 'extreme', 'Tetsuo', 'tattoos', 'piercings', 'are', 'not', 'ritual', 'fact', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'direct', 'self-mutilation', 'alteration', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'slapped', 'Warning', 'Adult', 'Content', 'labels', 'frankly', 'American', 'cinema', 'seen', 'much', 'Fight', 'Club', 'people', 'draw', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'misleading', 'first', 'plots', 'are', 'nothing', 'alike', 'more', 'similar', 'Tetsuo', 'anything', 'else', 'Second', 'terms', 'direction', 'simply', 'better', 'film', 'obvious', 'Tsukamoto', 'sat', 'down', 'thought', 'hard', 'how', 'exactly', 'wanted', 'shot', 'be', 'presented', 'David', 'Fincher', 'tried', 'assault', 'senses', 'NOT', 'thinking', 'not', 'as', 'digestible', 'American', 'audiences', 'breaks.Tsukamoto', 'distinct', 'directorial', 'style', 'even', 'little', 'stop-motion', 'here', 'better', 'defined', 'here', 'especially', 'use', 'color', 'video', 'game', 'style', 'very', 'much', 'present', 'here', 'not', 'everyone', ""'re"", 'interested', 'being', 'challenged', 'probably', 'also', 'good', 'lead-in', 'Tetsuo', 'same', 'warning', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'sampled', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'David', 'Lynch', 'few', 'other', 'perverse', 'filmmakers', ""'d"", 'step', 'carefully']",Tokyo Fist VHS
443513,A3SOKVFUWBC31N,6305003777,garlandb,"[4, 4]","Shinya Tsukamoto has definitely matured a great deal since Tetsuo.  This is one of those movies that have a few really incredible moments and some not so interesting, slow moving parts.  The 'good parts' of this film are very, very good though. The violence is very over the top and the makeup is quite grotesque.  I find that the makeup in Asian films, although not as flawless as Hollywood makeup, is always tough to take.  After a character endures a brutal beating (in this film the aforementioned beatings are sometimes self afflicted) their face is covered in blood and various horrible contusions, bruises, etc.  While not an incredible movie throughout the climax, which is made up of a montage between the three main characters, is incredible.  I'm not really sure who to recommend this movie to since it's not very similar to Tsukamoto's earlier efforts.  It's  one of those very original, very cool movies that you won't want to buy but will be very happy you experienced it.",3,wow....,994896000,"07 12, 2001",2001,986,"['Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', 'definitely', 'matured', 'great', 'deal', 'Tetsuo', 'one', 'movies', 'have', 'few', 'really', 'incredible', 'moments', 'not', 'so', 'interesting', 'slow', 'moving', 'parts', ""'good"", 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'though', 'violence', 'very', 'top', 'makeup', 'quite', 'grotesque', 'find', 'makeup', 'Asian', 'films', 'not', 'as', 'flawless', 'Hollywood', 'makeup', 'always', 'tough', 'take', 'character', 'brutal', 'beating', 'film', 'aforementioned', 'beatings', 'are', 'sometimes', 'self', 'afflicted', 'face', 'covered', 'blood', 'various', 'horrible', 'contusions', 'bruises', 'etc', 'not', 'incredible', 'movie', 'climax', 'made', 'montage', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'incredible', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'who', 'recommend', 'movie', 'not', 'very', 'similar', 'Tsukamoto', 'earlier', 'efforts', 'one', 'very', 'original', 'very', 'cool', 'movies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'buy', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'happy', 'experienced']",Tokyo Fist VHS
443514,A1CEQK91FDYSYF,6305003777,Scott M. Fedor,"[7, 8]","Tokyo Fist shows the development of Shinya Tsukamoto's directorial skills. While Tokyo Fist still contains the brilliant, over the top visuals of the Tetsuo series(used to great effect in the boxing ring), he allows the camera and film to be calm, allowing story, thought and emotion to enter. There is strong character development in this one as the protagonists try to understand how one can feel and be alive in a cold city. Definetly not recommended  for the squeamish as Tsukamoto has to no issue with placing the grotesque in your face.",5,Tsukamoto only gets better,911952000,"11 25, 1998",1998,542,"['Tokyo', 'Fist', 'development', 'Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', 'directorial', 'skills', 'Tokyo', 'Fist', 'still', 'brilliant', 'top', 'visuals', 'Tetsuo', 'series', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'boxing', 'ring', 'camera', 'film', 'be', 'calm', 'allowing', 'story', 'thought', 'emotion', 'enter', 'strong', 'character', 'development', 'one', 'protagonists', 'try', 'understand', 'how', 'one', 'can', 'feel', 'be', 'alive', 'cold', 'city', 'Definetly', 'not', 'recommended', 'squeamish', 'Tsukamoto', 'issue', 'placing', 'grotesque', 'face']",Tokyo Fist VHS
443515,A2XOOZJSXIOX36,6305003777,"""weapon_xxx""","[1, 7]","Being a survivor of both Tetsuo and Tetsuo 2 before watching this film, I felt I was ready for anything Tsukamato could ever think of throwing at his core audience. What I was unprepared for was gore in bucket loads and a  plot even hazier than the aforementioned films. Although it seems to be the  director's style to have a less than linear plot and even less editing to a  movie, Tokyo Fist seems to me as a failed attempt at a boxing movie.  Self-mutilation, childhood rivalry, and a self-destructive path covers the  visuals of what could possibly be the sickest overseas movie I've seen in a  while. The strange thing about this movie is that it had more than it's  fair share of potential. With a little storyline twist here, a little less  over acting there, and a little more realistic fights on the side would've  made this a good buy. Unfortunately, Tsukamato's taste for the bizzare,  intense, and sadistic visuals somewhat ruined this movie. So why didn't I  just give this a one star instead of two? Simple, any movie that makes you  wanna barf 90 percent of the time deserves an extra star for effort.  Another demented movie(with no real point) from a really demented  director(who seems to have some serious issues to deal with).",2,Tsukamato fans beware,948067200,"01 17, 2000",2000,1247,"['Being', 'survivor', 'Tetsuo', 'Tetsuo', '2', 'watching', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'ready', 'anything', 'Tsukamato', 'could', 'ever', 'think', 'throwing', 'core', 'audience', 'What', 'was', 'unprepared', 'was', 'gore', 'bucket', 'loads', 'plot', 'even', 'hazier', 'aforementioned', 'films', 'be', 'director', 'style', 'have', 'less', 'linear', 'plot', 'even', 'less', 'editing', 'movie', 'Tokyo', 'Fist', 'failed', 'attempt', 'boxing', 'movie', 'Self-mutilation', 'childhood', 'rivalry', 'self-destructive', 'path', 'visuals', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'sickest', 'overseas', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'strange', 'thing', 'movie', 'had', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'potential', 'little', 'storyline', 'twist', 'here', 'little', 'less', 'acting', 'there', 'little', 'more', 'realistic', 'fights', 'side', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'good', 'buy', 'Unfortunately', 'Tsukamato', 'taste', 'bizzare', 'intense', 'sadistic', 'visuals', 'somewhat', 'ruined', 'movie', 'So', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'give', 'one', 'star', 'instead', 'two', 'Simple', 'movie', 'wan', 'barf', '90', 'percent', 'time', 'extra', 'star', 'effort', 'demented', 'movie', 'real', 'point', 'really', 'demented', 'director', 'who', 'have', 'serious', 'issues', 'deal']",Tokyo Fist VHS
