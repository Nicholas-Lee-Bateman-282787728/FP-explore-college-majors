The lead character is a black man who is wrongfully imprisoned and then cruelly experimented on in jail.  When he gets out, he has a unique Pinnochio-esque talent. But, it's not his nose that grows...think lower and longer (ha, ha).  I could not stop laughing as he killed his enemies with his ""secret weapon"".  This movie is not meant to be taken serious, but it accomplishes something the other Blaxploitation films of this time did not...a truly unique storyline.",4,Blaxploitation meets Sci-Fi,1140739200,"02 24, 2006",2006,519,"['movie', 'pinnacle', 'Blaxploitation', 'films', 'lead', 'character', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'wrongfully', 'imprisoned', 'then', 'cruelly', 'experimented', 'jail', 'When', 'out', 'unique', 'Pinnochio-esque', 'talent', 'not', 'nose', 'think', 'lower', 'longer', 'ha', 'ha', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'laughing', 'killed', 'enemies', 'secret', 'weapon', 'movie', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'serious', 'something', 'other', 'Blaxploitation', 'films', 'time', 'did', 'not', 'truly', 'unique', 'storyline']",N/A

If you're simply waiting to see the infamous ""prop"" -- you're in for a disappointment: it appears (only once!) during the final five minutes of the film, and even then it's non-eventful and (excuse the pun) anti-climactic. The story is poorly conceived, written and executed, and overall the film brings nothing new or fresh to the table for this type of film. Trust me, you've seen it all before in much better films of the period. This dull and dated dud isn't worth your time -- avoid it at all costs! Check out the director's under-rated and almost ignored gem, ""Black Sister's Revenge"" instead -- it'll surprise you.",1,Don't Wast Your Time...,1190505600,"09 23, 2007",2007,755,"['Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'hype', 'film', 'boring', 'dull', 'dirt', 'love', 'films', 'period/genre', 'one', 'redeeming', 'value', ""'re"", 'simply', 'waiting', 'see', 'infamous', 'prop', ""'re"", 'disappointment', 'only', 'once', 'final', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'even', 'then', 'non-eventful', 'excuse', 'pun', 'anti-climactic', 'story', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'written', 'executed', 'film', 'nothing', 'new', 'fresh', 'table', 'type', 'film', 'Trust', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'period', 'dull', 'dated', 'dud', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', 'avoid', 'costs', 'Check', 'director', 'under-rated', 'almost', 'ignored', 'gem', 'Black', 'Sister', 'Revenge', 'instead', ""'ll"", 'surprise']",N/A

Disjointed narrative is an understatement... You get the sense the film was made on the go and when the director realized it was going nowhere came up with a really clever little plot twist... Anton Checkov once wrote a great dramatic rule :  If there's a gun in the first act, it is bound to go off in the second.  And in this film, if there's a severed member in the first part its bound to... well I hope this isn't a spoiler... grow back and murder people in the second.  - - A great idea for Camp sci-fi, but actually the film is mostly standard fair urban action, though a bit sleazer than many of its more famous counterparts....  and you have to sit through 90 minutes of classic BAD (yet charming, engaging and funky) blacksploitation until the big scene.... and when it finally happens you're like, ""Whuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh the ???""  A killer p*nis ???  My gosh, what would SHAFT have to say to that ?Overall, this film is definitely a great primer on how not to make a film... I agree, but many of the scenes are so unintentionally campy and funny it is hard to turn off the film even when you realize the director has no idea where the film is leading either and you're...As a final note, I love the dirty cops and the corrupt judge in this film... standard fair for blacksploitation, but taken way overboard.  My favorite is the scene where the dirty cop catches his wife being screwed by a black guy... but unfortunately can't confront her because he has to go and diffuse a bomb (footage of wife being made love to, cop diffusing bomb, and stock footage of a airplane, presumably a phallic symbol taking off.)  He is later taken to the hospital having had a minor dose of radiation (???) When he comes home later that night she asks him if he's reading anything interesting in the papers, and dramatically he contronts her in an Emmy Award winning scene to which she makes direct mention of his shriveled up p*nis.  He responds by starting to strangle her to death... then reviving her... then she walking out of the room and taunting him for not getting rid of the one problem he couldn't handle.  The film gets better from there...All in all... for some memorable REALLY BAD '70s URBAN THRILLER/BLACK ACTION cinema watch this movie... its definitely one watch you'll reMEMBER for a long time especially whenever you go to the bathroom and look down...",4,Whuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ?,1130284800,"10 26, 2005",2005,2468,"['reviewers', 'here', 'are', 'spot', 'one', 'film', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'Disjointed', 'narrative', 'understatement', 'get', 'sense', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'go', 'when', 'director', 'realized', 'was', 'going', 'nowhere', 'came', 'up', 'really', 'clever', 'little', 'plot', 'twist', 'Anton', 'Checkov', 'once', 'wrote', 'great', 'dramatic', 'rule', 'gun', 'first', 'act', 'bound', 'go', 'off', 'second', 'film', 'severed', 'member', 'first', 'part', 'bound', 'well', 'hope', ""n't"", 'spoiler', 'grow', 'back', 'murder', 'people', 'second', 'great', 'idea', 'Camp', 'sci-fi', 'actually', 'film', 'mostly', 'standard', 'fair', 'urban', 'action', 'bit', 'sleazer', 'many', 'more', 'famous', 'counterparts', 'have', 'sit', '90', 'minutes', 'classic', 'BAD', 'yet', 'charming', 'engaging', 'funky', 'blacksploitation', 'big', 'scene', 'when', 'finally', ""'re"", 'killer', 'p*nis', 'gosh', 'what', 'would', 'SHAFT', 'have', 'say', 'Overall', 'film', 'definitely', 'great', 'primer', 'how', 'not', 'make', 'film', 'agree', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'unintentionally', 'campy', 'funny', 'hard', 'turn', 'off', 'film', 'even', 'when', 'realize', 'director', 'idea', 'where', 'film', 'leading', 'either', ""'re"", 'final', 'note', 'love', 'dirty', 'cops', 'corrupt', 'judge', 'film', 'standard', 'fair', 'blacksploitation', 'taken', 'way', 'overboard', 'favorite', 'scene', 'where', 'dirty', 'cop', 'wife', 'being', 'screwed', 'black', 'guy', 'unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'confront', 'go', 'diffuse', 'bomb', 'footage', 'wife', 'being', 'made', 'love', 'cop', 'diffusing', 'bomb', 'stock', 'footage', 'airplane', 'presumably', 'phallic', 'symbol', 'taking', 'off', 'later', 'taken', 'hospital', 'having', 'had', 'minor', 'dose', 'radiation', 'When', 'home', 'later', 'night', 'reading', 'anything', 'interesting', 'papers', 'dramatically', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'winning', 'scene', 'direct', 'mention', 'shriveled', 'up', 'p*nis', 'starting', 'strangle', 'death', 'then', 'reviving', 'then', 'walking', 'room', 'taunting', 'not', 'getting', 'rid', 'one', 'problem', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'film', 'better', 'memorable', 'REALLY', 'BAD', 'URBAN', 'THRILLER/BLACK', 'ACTION', 'cinema', 'watch', 'movie', 'definitely', 'one', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'reMEMBER', 'long', 'time', 'especially', 'whenever', 'go', 'bathroom', 'look', 'down']",N/A
