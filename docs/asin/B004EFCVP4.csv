If you're looking for a solid KETTLEBELL workout (which I was) then you'll need to look elsewhere.1. Almost 50% of this workout is old-school calisthenics (push-ups, burpees, etc.) and aerobics! This is completely unnecessary for a kettlebell workout, and suggests to me that he either doesn't trust the full cardio benefits of kettlebells by themselves, or doesn't trust that the people who buy this DVD already appreciate the benefits of kettlebells. You do a kettlebell move or two, and then immediately put those down to do something from your eighth-grade gym class.2. At best, techniques are presented as little pointers. For example, barely 10 minutes in, he's doing high windmills with just a word or two on technique. There's nothing on this DVD to thoroughly demonstrate or explain how to do this move - or any of them - safely and properly. (I guess he's assuming you bought the Bob Harper kettlebell and watched the DVD that comes with that. Since I already own a non-Bob Harper kettlebell, I'd say that's a risky assumption.)3. There's no rest, not even a few seconds' worth, between kettlebell and calisthenic moves, and for this level of intensity, there SHOULD be. It's very easy to think you're not working as hard as you really are when swinging a kettlebell, and Bob should know better.4. There's no chapters, no way to skip the 5-minute warm-up if you've already been doing something else, and the only 'extra' is a trailer. There's no suggested workout schedule like on his Biggest Loser DVDs, no section on kettlebell moves and safety, nothing.All in all, I think Bob should probably stay away from kettlebells - it didn't come off as something he was really strong or knowledgeable in, particularly when there's others who are. I was very disappointed with this one. If I wanted to spend half my workout time on traditional bodyweight exercises in the bootcamp style, I wouldn't have bought what was supposed to be a kettlebell DVD.",2,Not for true kettlebell enthusiasts,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,2020,"['have', 'other', 'Bob', 'Harper', 'DVDs', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'one', ""'re"", 'looking', 'solid', 'KETTLEBELL', 'workout', 'was', 'then', ""'ll"", 'need', 'look', 'elsewhere.1', '50', '%', 'workout', 'old-school', 'calisthenics', 'push-ups', 'burpees', 'etc', 'aerobics', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'kettlebell', 'workout', 'either', ""n't"", 'trust', 'full', 'cardio', 'benefits', 'kettlebells', ""n't"", 'trust', 'people', 'who', 'buy', 'DVD', 'already', 'appreciate', 'benefits', 'kettlebells', 'do', 'kettlebell', 'move', 'two', 'then', 'immediately', 'put', 'do', 'something', 'eighth-grade', 'gym', 'class.2', 'best', 'techniques', 'are', 'presented', 'little', 'pointers', 'example', 'barely', '10', 'minutes', 'doing', 'high', 'windmills', 'just', 'word', 'two', 'technique', 'nothing', 'DVD', 'thoroughly', 'demonstrate', 'explain', 'how', 'do', 'move', 'safely', 'properly', 'guess', 'assuming', 'bought', 'Bob', 'Harper', 'kettlebell', 'watched', 'DVD', 'already', 'own', 'non-Bob', 'Harper', 'kettlebell', ""'d"", 'say', 'risky', 'assumption.', '3', 'rest', 'not', 'even', 'few', 'seconds', 'worth', 'kettlebell', 'calisthenic', 'moves', 'level', 'intensity', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'very', 'easy', 'think', ""'re"", 'not', 'working', 'as', 'hard', 'really', 'are', 'when', 'swinging', 'kettlebell', 'Bob', 'should', 'know', 'better.4', 'chapters', 'way', 'skip', '5-minute', 'warm-up', ""'ve"", 'already', 'been', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'only', ""'extra"", 'trailer', 'suggested', 'workout', 'schedule', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'DVDs', 'section', 'kettlebell', 'moves', 'safety', 'nothing.All', 'think', 'Bob', 'should', 'probably', 'stay', 'away', 'kettlebells', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'something', 'was', 'really', 'strong', 'knowledgeable', 'particularly', 'when', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'one', 'wanted', 'spend', 'half', 'workout', 'time', 'traditional', 'bodyweight', 'exercises', 'bootcamp', 'style', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bought', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'kettlebell', 'DVD']","GoFit Bob Harper Inside Out Method – KettleBell Cardio Shred Workout Cardio Fitness, Maximum Fat Burn, by GoFit"

1398050,A18DR4XE98W902,B004EFCVP4,anniemaed,"[2, 2]","I bought this dvd about 6 months ago.  I do this workout every once and a while, I add it to my gym routine.  When I first started doing this dvd I was new to kettlebells.  As I have done more kettlebell classes with kettlebell trained instructors I have learned more about proper technique and form and now have some issues with this dvd.  My biggest issue with this workout is the form used in the dvd.  Bob says he's all about good form but he doesn't execute it in the workout.  You are supposed to pick up your kettlebell in a squat form, as opposed to bending over to pick it up.  This is done to avoid injuries, Bob and Becky never once pick up the kettlebell the proper way!They also do not use proper form when completing swings.  They seem to perform their swings by squating and thrusting their kettlebells up with their arms.  The proper way to do a swing is to slightly bend the knees and swing the bell high under you (if that makes sense).  The bell is not supposed to be swung low, it's supposed to be swung high and then you thrust the bell up with your hips, not your arms.Another major no-no is that Becky and Bob both suddenly stop the kettlebell when they are done with their swings.  This is a major No-No!  It can hurt your back and you can injure yourself.  You are supposed to descend on your swing and let the swing settle down before you put your kettlebell down, just not set it down right away.I gave this dvd the rating that I did because it's not a lost cause.  Bob does use proper form on Pass-thru lunges and Snatches.  Also, when these exercises are done the proper way this is a good workout!  Bob is no joke, he works you out hard the whole time.  I would just utilize other workout dvds besides this one.  Or at least do some research on proper form.",3,Good workout but workout needs work,1341100800,"07 1, 2012",2012,1787,"['bought', 'dvd', '6', 'months', 'ago', 'do', 'workout', 'once', 'while', 'add', 'gym', 'routine', 'When', 'first', 'started', 'doing', 'dvd', 'was', 'new', 'kettlebells', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'kettlebell', 'classes', 'kettlebell', 'trained', 'instructors', 'have', 'learned', 'more', 'proper', 'technique', 'form', 'now', 'have', 'issues', 'dvd', 'biggest', 'issue', 'workout', 'form', 'used', 'dvd', 'Bob', 'about', 'good', 'form', ""n't"", 'execute', 'workout', 'are', 'supposed', 'pick', 'up', 'kettlebell', 'squat', 'form', 'opposed', 'bending', 'pick', 'up', 'done', 'avoid', 'injuries', 'Bob', 'Becky', 'never', 'once', 'pick', 'up', 'kettlebell', 'proper', 'way', 'also', 'do', 'not', 'use', 'proper', 'form', 'when', 'completing', 'swings', 'seem', 'perform', 'swings', 'squating', 'thrusting', 'kettlebells', 'arms', 'proper', 'way', 'do', 'swing', 'slightly', 'bend', 'knees', 'swing', 'bell', 'high', 'sense', 'bell', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'swung', 'low', 'supposed', 'be', 'swung', 'high', 'then', 'thrust', 'bell', 'up', 'hips', 'not', 'arms.Another', 'major', 'no-no', 'Becky', 'Bob', 'suddenly', 'stop', 'kettlebell', 'when', 'are', 'done', 'swings', 'major', 'No-No', 'can', 'hurt', 'back', 'can', 'injure', 'are', 'supposed', 'descend', 'swing', 'let', 'swing', 'settle', 'down', 'put', 'kettlebell', 'down', 'just', 'not', 'set', 'down', 'right', 'away.I', 'gave', 'dvd', 'rating', 'did', 'not', 'lost', 'cause', 'Bob', 'use', 'proper', 'form', 'Pass-thru', 'lunges', 'Snatches', 'Also', 'when', 'exercises', 'are', 'done', 'proper', 'way', 'good', 'workout', 'Bob', 'joke', 'out', 'hard', 'whole', 'time', 'would', 'just', 'utilize', 'other', 'workout', 'dvds', 'one', 'least', 'do', 'research', 'proper', 'form']","GoFit Bob Harper Inside Out Method – KettleBell Cardio Shred Workout Cardio Fitness, Maximum Fat Burn, by GoFit"

This is a nice workout but I do have to say that Bob's Cardio Conditioning workout is more intense and uses many of the same kettlebell moves, only uses a dumbell instead.  This will give you a good workout, don't get me wrong.  I consider myself an advanced exerciser and it definitely got my heart pumping.  But at no point did I feel like I wasn't sure I could do anymore, which I felt at times with the Cardio Conditioning one.  I think perhaps the CC one is a little more fast paced.

1398053,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,B004EFCVP4,Chandler,"[154, 163]","In my eyes, Bob Harper has always been the perfect trainer. I haven't missed one DVD he has and I've never been let down. Not only does he have an ease on camera that makes you feel as though he is personally encouraging you, he explains each move so that you do it best and do it right...and he motivates.  Because the DVDs he's now putting out without the Biggest Loser title are nothing short of fantastic (really professionally put together with the camera shots, close up to show important form, timers, set, backup trainers in perfect form and in sync etc) I was beyond thrilled to see a kettlebell workout by him.I've been doing kettlebells for some time now and if you've never tried one, I have to say you are missing out. Unlike many things that enter the market and become a workout fad, this has, instead, blown up in popularity even with professional body builders and it's easy to see why. You use muscles you wouldn't ordinarily use and you have FUN working out with all the swings and moves that feel more like a game than repetitive handweights moving up and down and its been proven that the kettlebell workouts burn more calories in less time and I concur.) Additionally, I use my kettlebell in any other workout where they ask me to hold two weights in one hand. It's simply more comfortable.That said, as far as a fantastic workout...this will push you and you will quickly see results. While I normally use a 12 lb kettlebell even though I use 2 7-lb. dumbbells when working out, this one really works best for me if I use a lighter kettlebell due to the repetitive reps rather than varying movements.So here's the thing...I have mixed feelings on this one. Bob is his regular awesome, inspiring, motivating self. However, while all of his other DVDs inspire me to keep going, I didn't feel this one had quite the same energy. In fact, I can't even believe I'm saying it, but sometimes it was boring and I wanted to quit. I think part of the reason is that I felt more as though I was watching Bob in a room training a pretty low-energy female rather than being a part of the action. He still explained all moves flawlessly but he's in a room with only one other person that he is basically training and showing the moves to, and she oddly drains the energy he puts out...pretty much frowning and looking serious the entire time with nary an ounce of energy or smile. It was part way through that I finally realized why all the back-up people in other DVDs smile when they workout, which I'd always thought silly before. It actually REALLY does exude energy through the screen. Because when it's not there, I felt it. She looked bored and unhappy.  And there was no one else to look at. So I kind of felt the same......especially because the moves are pretty repetitive when ordinarily he takes you through all different moves that work the same parts just to shake it up...so you get the gain without the boredom. But the first time I did it it felt like, in the first 15 minutes, I was mostly just doing the same things as compared to other kettlebell DVDs. I may not have minded had I not already felt it was not so exciting to watch as compared to his other DVDs and other kettlebell DVDs.Never in my life would I have thought I'd prefer Jillian's training to his, as much as she offers amazing workouts, she has nervous and silly-tough energy...but her new kettlebell DVD, gulp, I actually liked better. I can't believe I think so.I don't think what I didn't like is his fault so much as the serious atmosphere in watching him train someone with no enthusiasm.That said, do I still feel very positive about the workout? I do. This will change your body. You will feel it during the workout and the next day and you will do the moves perfectly with perfect cueing and form. You will learn to use the kettlebell flawlessly and change your body. That is, afterall, what we all wish to achieve with such a purchase in the long run so motivate yourself with some music that inspires you if you, too, feel a lower dose of energy, stick with it, follow Bob's good training...and this is still well worth the purchase.Would I rename this Kettlebell Strength Shred? For sure. It's far more strength training than cardio. However, it burned great calories for a strength DVD, just like all kettlebell DVDs seem to (I measure my calories burned with a bodybugg so I can compare it not only to other fitness DVDs but also see how much my metabolism increased hours after a strength DVD. Cardio burns more during the workout but while strength training burns less during, it continues to burn hours afterwards and build muscle to also burn more calories even at rest.)Would I change a few things if I could? Yes. Will I still stick with it and be happy I bought the DVD? Absolutely...I just wanted to give the full picture of my own experience.",4,An excellent workout but I have to say I'm surprised it's not my fave kettlebell workout,1295395200,"01 19,

1398056,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B004EFCVP4,Colleen M. Schneider,"[0, 0]","I have tried several of Bob Harper's workouts in the series and he is a tough trainer.  I know if I pick out one of his workouts to do I will be working out, sweating like mad and he won't let me off lightly.  I have done several kettlebell workouts and I found that I really thought this one was well done.  It is just Bob and Becky who demonstrate the moves and I like the fact that she looks like she has to work at it a bit too.  He corrects form and demonstrates proper technique which is must when you are swinging around 5-20+ lbs. of weight. I would not consider this to be a beginner level, so if you would like something that will give you more training, I would seek out a beginners kettlebell workout-Amy Bento has a good one. If you are more intermediate/advanced you will feel like you can take the minimal instruction and just move on with your workout, which will include a 5 minute warm-up, 39 heart pumping minutes of kettlebell, 4 minutes of abs and a 5 minute cool down.  During the workout you will do deadlifts, kettlebell swings, push presses, cleans, modified turkish get-ups, lunges with a pass through the legs and burpees among other exercises.As a daily exerciser who does a variety of different types of workouts I find the weighted workouts (whether kettlebell or not) tend to be more challenging to me, so I definitely found these to challenge me and now two hours after the workout I have that wiggly leg feeling and can definitely feel my butt got a pretty awesome workout as well as my abs.Do I love it?

I expected to hate everything about this...I love dance-inspired exercise, but traditional cardio and strength workouts usually make me want to nap instead.  However, I am sitting on the longest weight loss plateau ever and needed something new to help me really BURN away the calories, and this did not disappoint at all.  I am ON FIRE after I finish this up.  The moves you will do in this workout include:with kettlebell--dead liftsswingssingle-arm swingscleanssnatchessquats and presseswindmillsalternating lunges with kettlebell pass underwood chopslunges with wood chopsmodified ab twistsmodified half teasermodified Turkish get upmostly without kettlebell moves--push-upshigh kneesburpeeslungesstandard ab crunchcrunches with knees upbicycle crunches--FAST!I might have forgotten some, but that is the gist of it.  I LOATHE most of those moves.  I also even thought that I hated the new ""dark"" Bob Harper, because he certainly is not the same sweet trainer we met on the first season of Biggest Loser.  However, I found him to be motivating.  What was even more motivating was watching his poor victim--er, demonstrator, Becky--work through these moves and be mildly verbally abused throughout much of the workout.  She is real and unrehearsed, clearly, and she struggles with some moves.  She leaves you out in the dark a few times by doing the completely wrong move...and then Bob chides her for it.  I have no idea why, but I smile every time he makes fun of Becky.  It makes me feel better about myself.  I am both laughing at poor Becky's misfortune and thinking of how he would criticize me if I were the one in the room with him.  Whether Bob is doing this on purpose as some psychological trick, I can't say.  From other reviews, it sounds like most don't really enjoy it.  For whatever reason, it motivates and entertains me, and I get excited to see Bob giving Becky a hard time while I workout.Note on form and instruction:  As some other reviewers have pointed out, Bob doesn't give you an overly-detailed description of form for every move.  I have one other kettlebell workout that I had done prior to purchasing this--Gaiam Kettlenetics Slim and Tone Kitwhich has a bit more detailed instruction of the basic kettlebell moves.  I had also watched the tutorial DVD provided with myGoFit 10-Pound Yellow Kettlebell with Vinyl Coating, Training DVD and Exercise Bookletprior to this, so I had a grasp of the moves already.  I like the way Michelle Khai describes best form for Kettlenetics, and I think the same can be said here although the weight is higher--most importantly, just think of the bell as an extension of your body and keep it in the rack position to protect your shoulders.  These moves are fluid and rely on momentum and strength, so keep up the momentum!",5,Schadenfreude,1305158400,"05 12, 2011",2011,2831,"['workout', 'completely', 'kicks', 'butt', 'expected', 'hate', 'everything', 'love', 'dance-inspired', 'exercise', 'traditional', 'cardio', 'strength', 'workouts', 'usually', 'make', 'want', 'nap', 'instead', 'However', 'am', 'sitting', 'longest', 'weight', 'loss', 'plateau', 'ever', 'needed', 'something', 'new', 'help', 'really', 'BURN', 'away', 'calories', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'am', 'ON', 'FIRE', 'finish', 'up', 'moves', 'will', 'do', 'workout', 'include', 'kettlebell', 'dead', 'liftsswingssingle-arm', 'swingscleanssnatchessquats', 'presseswindmillsalternating', 'lunges', 'kettlebell', 'pass', 'underwood', 'chopslunges', 'wood', 'chopsmodified', 'ab', 'twistsmodified', 'half', 'teasermodified', 'Turkish', 'get', 'upmostly', 'kettlebell', 'moves', 'push-upshigh', 'kneesburpeeslungesstandard', 'ab', 'crunchcrunches', 'knees', 'upbicycle', 'crunches', 'might', 'have', 'forgotten', 'gist', 'LOATHE', 'most', 'moves', 'also', 'even', 'thought', 'hated', 'new', 'dark', 'Bob', 'Harper', 'certainly', 'not', 'same', 'sweet', 'trainer', 'met', 'first', 'season', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'However', 'found', 'be', 'motivating', 'What', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'motivating', 'was', 'watching', 'poor', 'victim', 'er', 'demonstrator', 'Becky', 'work', 'moves', 'be', 'mildly', 'verbally', 'abused', 'much', 'workout', 'real', 'unrehearsed', 'clearly', 'moves', 'out', 'dark', 'few', 'times', 'doing', 'completely', 'wrong', 'move', 'then', 'Bob', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'smile', 'time', 'fun', 'Becky', 'feel', 'better', 'am', 'laughing', 'poor', 'Becky', 'misfortune', 'thinking', 'how', 'would', 'criticize', 'were', 'one', 'room', 'Whether', 'Bob', 'doing', 'purpose', 'psychological', 'trick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'other', 'reviews', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'reason', 'get', 'excited', 'see', 'Bob', 'giving', 'Becky', 'hard', 'time', 'workout.Note', 'form', 'instruction', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'Bob', ""n't"", 'give', 'overly-detailed', 'description', 'form', 'move', 'have', 'one', 'other', 'kettlebell', 'had', 'done', 'prior', 'purchasing', 'Gaiam', 'Kettlenetics', 'Slim', 'Tone', 'Kitwhich', 'bit', 'more', 'detailed', 'instruction', 'basic', 'kettlebell', 'moves', 'had', 'also', 'watched', 'tutorial', 'DVD', 'provided', 'myGoFit', '10-Pound', 'Yellow', 'Kettlebell', 'Vinyl', 'Coating', 'Training', 'DVD', 'Exercise', 'Bookletprior', 'had', 'grasp', 'moves', 'already', 'way', 'Michelle', 'Khai', 'best', 'form', 'Kettlenetics', 'think', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'here', 'weight', 'higher', 'most', 'importantly', 'just', 'think', 'bell', 'extension', 'body', 'keep', 'rack', 'position', 'protect', 'shoulders', 'moves', 'are', 'fluid', 'rely', 'momentum', 'strength', 'so', 'keep', 'up', 'momentum']","GoFit Bob Harper Inside Out Method – KettleBell Cardio Shred Workout Cardio Fitness, Maximum Fat Burn, by GoFit"

Robinson ""The Queen""","[20, 20]","I have been working with kettlebells for over 2 years consistently and this is a solid, good, decent workout with the right kettlebell.I used a 13# kettlebell for more of a cardio effect and it did the job.Bob's instruction is on point and far better than Jillian's kettlebell workout which from many professional kb instructors was a total train wreck.  Form in using a kettlebell is very important, as you can easily injure yourself.This workout did have strength moves but was more intensive in the swings, snatch, cleans, clean & press, squats, alternating swings, etc.  These moves are cardio intensive.I also have Bob's other kettlebell workout which isBob Harper: Kettlebell Sculpted Bodyand it is intended for more strength drills.  The biggest difference is the weight of the kettlebell.  KBs are not any different than dumbbells as in when you need more intensity, power to fatigue you must increase the weight.  For Bob's other workout I used a 22# & 25# for the moves.For 10.99, this DVD is worth getting.  Kettlebells if used minimum 3x's a week will give you faster results than any other workout on the market.  Guaranteed.One last thing, this workout as Bob's other is more in a beginning feeling, as I already know the moves, so as he was talking I was working the exercise move, since I know it already.
