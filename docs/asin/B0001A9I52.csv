Steve McQueen spent his whole life trying to prove a point and reach for greatness. He was definitely one of a kind, it will be long debated if he ever found true happiness. This is quite a dark moody movie, definitely won't appeal to everyone, but it is in it's way a classic, it should be judged for the excellent acting abilities of the major players.",4,Steve McQueen - One of a Kind,1386720000,"12 11, 2013",2013,539,"['Great', 'see', 'early', 'potential', 'great', 'star', 'had', 'characteristics', 'James', 'Dean', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'etc', 'showed', 'unique', 'mean', 'streak', 'was', 'become', 'trade', 'mark', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'spent', 'whole', 'life', 'trying', 'prove', 'point', 'reach', 'greatness', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'kind', 'will', 'be', 'long', 'debated', 'ever', 'found', 'true', 'happiness', 'quite', 'dark', 'moody', 'movie', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'everyone', 'way', 'classic', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'excellent', 'acting', 'abilities', 'major', 'players']",N/A

Steve McQueen was already a polished actor, and he had to be handed with this crummy project? Luckily, he was able to shrug it off and begin his ascent to immortality when he signed for The Sand Pebbles, Papillon, Junior Bonner, and Bullitt. The biggest problem with Baby, the Rain Must Fall was that nothing happens. There wasn't an explanation at all. Steve McQueen couldn't do very much because he was given so little to work with. There wasn't even a Steve McQueen moment. Lee Remick would just stare for hours and maintain her usual frigidity. How that woman got work in Hollywood is beyond me. She was impossible to have chemistry with, and Steve certainly felt that. Some images of Baby, the Rain Must Fall reminded me of The Last Picture Show, and some of the feelings within Baby, the Rain Must Fall were similar to The Fugitive Kind with Marlon Brando. All in all, Steve McQueen didn't make many films in his career, and each time a film was wasted, his talent was wasted.",1,Angry Steve McQueen Wants to Bash Lee's Head to the Wall.,1344297600,"08 7, 2012",2012,1083,"['Viewed', '7/09Rate', '17/09', 'Baby', 'Rain', 'Must', 'Fall', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'was', 'made', '1965', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'was', 'already', 'polished', 'actor', 'had', 'be', 'handed', 'crummy', 'project', 'Luckily', 'was', 'able', 'shrug', 'off', 'begin', 'ascent', 'immortality', 'when', 'signed', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'Papillon', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'Bullitt', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Baby', 'Rain', 'Must', 'Fall', 'was', 'nothing', 'was', ""n't"", 'explanation', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'much', 'was', 'given', 'so', 'little', 'work', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'moment', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'would', 'just', 'stare', 'hours', 'maintain', 'usual', 'frigidity', 'How', 'woman', 'got', 'work', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'impossible', 'have', 'chemistry', 'Steve', 'certainly', 'felt', 'images', 'Baby', 'Rain', 'Must', 'Fall', 'reminded', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'feelings', 'Baby', 'Rain', 'Must', 'Fall', 'were', 'similar', 'Fugitive', 'Kind', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'many', 'films', 'career', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'wasted', 'talent', 'was', 'wasted']",N/A

What I liked was the cast, which featured two of my all-time favorite actors: Steve McQueen and Lee Remick.Remick plays an old-fashioned sweet woman that is rare to see on screen these days. It was not a glamorous role, but I don't believe she's ever looked prettier. Her unspoiled daughter in this film was a nice kid, too.If this film just wasn't so darn depressing at times, I would have kept it. I sold it, but now kind of wish I had it back. Maybe three viewings were enough.  Then again, it does have McQueen (who sings!) and Remick, and those two keep drawing me back.

Henry is willing to work hard to support his family but he still wants to perform with his ""string band"" and he is amazingly talented.The mysterious Miss Kate, an elderly woman who raised the orphaned Henry stands in his way.BABY THE RAIN MUST FALL misses the mark as story about relationships. Henry and Georgette are trying to build a life together but Henry must play by Miss Kate's rules. Why does Miss Kate have this magical hold over him? He's is treatened with being returned to prison if he does not go to night school to learn a trade rather than perform with his band. It is all so confusing and a potentionally interesting story is ruined. Remick is a standout as the long suffering yet loving mother and wife who will do anything for her family.
