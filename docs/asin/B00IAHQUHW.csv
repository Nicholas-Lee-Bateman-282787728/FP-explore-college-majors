1693857,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00IAHQUHW,Matthew Scott Baker,"[7, 8]","The DVD cover for this film, ABOUT A ZOMBIE, is a perfect example of how to draw me to a movie: put a gory, vicious-looking zombie on the front, and I&#8217;m pretty much hooked. I know, I know&#8230;you can&#8217;t judge a book (or a movie) by its cover, but at least a zombie in the artwork gets my hopes up. I&#8217;m happy to report this one lives up to its awesome movie cover, too. ABOUT A ZOMBIE is a brutal living dead flick that will rip your throat out and show it to you!This movie has all the elements of a great zombie flick: good story, good zombie effects, and great gore. I will admit the zombie make-up on a couple of the extras could have been better, but you only see them in passing so it&#8217;s not a big deal. Otherwise, this is just about a perfect horror film.ABOUT A ZOMBIE is shot well and is told from a couple of different viewpoints. Most of the story is told from the documentary filmmaker&#8217;s cameras. But there are a couple of scenes that use traditional third-person perspective shots, specifically when none of the filmmakers are around. This might sound odd, but it works well, and the transition from one to the other in the film is seamless.The special effects are excellent, and there&#8217;s plenty of gore to satiate the heartiest of gore-hounds. My sole complaint here is that most of the gunshot muzzle flashes are CG, and the animation looks a bit cheap. But as far as I can tell, most (if not all) of the zombie effects and gore are practical. There&#8217;s even an exceptionally brutal and gory scene when a zombie tears into a woman&#8217;s pregnant belly; this has to be seen to be appreciated (if you can stomach it!).The acting in ABOUT A ZOMBIE is good, too. I am particularly impressed with the work of Rory Mullen and Geraldine McAlinden, who portray the parents in the film. Both give stirring performances as two people who love their son so much that they are blind to his condition. Their realism in their roles help to bring an air of credibility to the film.ABOUT A ZOMBIE is a big win for me, and I highly suggest you give it a look. It&#8217;s nice to see zombies done by other countries besides the U.S., and this Irish take is certainly worthy of praise. The film is available now.",5,Excellent and brutal zombie fun,1396915200,"04 8, 2014",2014,2248,"['DVD', 'cover', 'film', 'ZOMBIE', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'draw', 'movie', 'put', 'gory', 'vicious-looking', 'zombie', 'front', '8217', 'pretty', 'much', 'hooked', 'know', 'know', '8230', 'can', '8217', 'judge', 'book', 'movie', 'cover', 'least', 'zombie', 'artwork', 'hopes', '8217', 'happy', 'report', 'one', 'up', 'awesome', 'movie', 'cover', 'too', 'ZOMBIE', 'brutal', 'living', 'dead', 'flick', 'will', 'rip', 'throat', 'show', 'movie', 'elements', 'great', 'zombie', 'flick', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'zombie', 'effects', 'great', 'gore', 'will', 'admit', 'zombie', 'make-up', 'couple', 'extras', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'only', 'see', 'passing', '8217', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'Otherwise', 'just', 'perfect', 'horror', 'ZOMBIE', 'shot', 'well', 'told', 'couple', 'different', 'viewpoints', 'Most', 'story', 'told', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', '8217', 'cameras', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'use', 'traditional', 'third-person', 'perspective', 'shots', 'specifically', 'when', 'none', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'around', 'might', 'sound', 'odd', 'well', 'transition', 'one', 'other', 'film', 'seamless.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'excellent', 'there', '8217', 's', 'plenty', 'gore', 'satiate', 'heartiest', 'gore-hounds', 'sole', 'complaint', 'here', 'most', 'gunshot', 'muzzle', 'flashes', 'are', 'CG', 'animation', 'bit', 'cheap', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'most', 'not', 'zombie', 'effects', 'gore', 'are', 'practical', '8217', 's', 'even', 'exceptionally', 'brutal', 'gory', 'scene', 'when', 'zombie', 'woman', '8217', 'pregnant', 'belly', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'appreciated', 'can', 'stomach', '.The', 'acting', 'ABOUT', 'A', 'ZOMBIE', 'good', 'too', 'am', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'work', 'Rory', 'Mullen', 'Geraldine', 'McAlinden', 'who', 'portray', 'parents', 'film', 'give', 'stirring', 'performances', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'son', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'blind', 'condition', 'realism', 'roles', 'help', 'bring', 'air', 'credibility', 'film.ABOUT', 'A', 'ZOMBIE', 'big', 'win', 'highly', 'suggest', 'give', 'look', '8217', 's', 'nice', 'see', 'zombies', 'done', 'other', 'countries', 'U.S.', 'Irish', 'take', 'certainly', 'worthy', 'praise', 'film', 'available', 'now']",About a Zombie
1693858,A394AF4TZK8WJO,B00IAHQUHW,"suzietoo ""sci-fi reader""","[2, 2]","Not just your average zombie flick. Part of the movie consists of an older married couple, and their son, who has turned and is kept in a room in the house, with a device over his mouth and secured in a straightjacket. What makes it so pathetic is his mother, who can't accept the fact that that isn't her son anymore. Then there are the mobsters, who gets involved and becomes like heroes, refusing to give in to their fate. It takes place in a town in Ireland, and as more and more unfortunates are attacked and partially devoured, a camera crew, headed by an American seek out fame and fortune by filming the soulless creatures.
