1344558,A3EI4K5U61UZ7,B003FSTN7K,A Mother of 2 Kidlets,"[0, 0]","Like many of the reviewers, I couldn't wait for this season to come out.  I loved season 1 and couldn't wait to see what season 2 had in store.  It felt odd to me that, for some reasons yet unknown, when Tara began getting triggered, it was Buck who surfaced, not Gimme, nor T. nor Alice.  I am trying to understand why Buck needed to have an affair at this time.The understanding is that Tara was on her meds and ""better"", hence the donating of the alters clothes.  Did she suddenly leave therapy?  If she was on some kind of meds, wouldn't she need to be monitored by a psych doc?  There were just some holes in the story lines that were disappointing.Moosh finally announcing himself as gay was something he needed to do for himself. Kate....well...I can't wait to see what they have her doing in season 3 because Princess Vahalla Hawkwind doesn't seem like a lasting sort of viable employment. Charmaine...I can surmise from the flashbacks Tara had that the half brother must have harmed Tara and she protected Charmaine...at least that's my best guess from the freakouts in the basement.All and all, it was an ok season.  Lots could be reworked differently.  I hope to see more of her alters...not parading around, but genuinely trying to understand one another and communicate.",4,Season Two....ups and downs,1294358400,"01 7, 2011",2011,1283,"['many', 'reviewers', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', 'come', 'out', 'loved', 'season', '1', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'season', '2', 'had', 'store', 'felt', 'odd', 'reasons', 'yet', 'unknown', 'when', 'Tara', 'began', 'getting', 'triggered', 'was', 'Buck', 'who', 'surfaced', 'not', 'Gim', 'T.', 'Alice', 'am', 'trying', 'understand', 'why', 'Buck', 'needed', 'have', 'affair', 'time.The', 'understanding', 'Tara', 'was', 'meds', 'better', 'donating', 'alters', 'clothes', 'Did', 'suddenly', 'leave', 'therapy', 'was', 'kind', 'meds', 'would', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'monitored', 'psych', 'doc', 'were', 'just', 'holes', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'disappointing.Moosh', 'finally', 'announcing', 'gay', 'was', 'something', 'needed', 'do', 'Kate', '.well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'have', 'doing', 'season', '3', 'Princess', 'Vahalla', 'Hawkwind', ""n't"", 'seem', 'lasting', 'sort', 'viable', 'employment', 'Charmaine', 'can', 'surmise', 'flashbacks', 'Tara', 'had', 'half', 'brother', 'must', 'have', 'harmed', 'Tara', 'protected', 'Charmaine', 'least', 'best', 'guess', 'freakouts', 'basement.All', 'was', 'ok', 'season', 'Lots', 'could', 'be', 'reworked', 'differently', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'alters', 'not', 'parading', 'around', 'genuinely', 'trying', 'understand', 'one', 'communicate']",N/A

1344565,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B003FSTN7K,Douglas King,"[17, 19]","Since I loved the first season of United States of Tara so much, I was surpirsed to find out that creator/lead writer Diablo Cody wasn't really happy with it, and felt the need to, if not revamp, perhaps tweak the series. Since I thought it was great the way it was, if it ain't broke, why fix it, right?The main difference, right off the bat, is in Tara. Although the titular character, in Season 1 Tara herself was usually subdued, frazzled, overwhelmed, or embarrassed, and it was the alters who stole the show. It seems like Season 2 finds the show taking great pains to make Tara more interesting, even without her alters. I'm not sure this always works. Like the Bob Newhart of her personalities, Tara is perhaps better off playing straight man and letting T, Buck, Alice, etc play their outrageous archetypes for all they're worth.The storylines in Season 2 probably succeed about 2/3 of the time. And even when they don't, they're not terrible. Tara's creation of an alter who's a New York psychiatrist is one of the season's best storylines, as well as how it ties into the revelations that finally allow Tara to find the source of her DID. Buck's romance with a barista, Marshall's awkward attempt at heterosexuality, and Kate's friendship with an eccentric artist are all some of the season's other highlights. Charmaine's wedding storyline is probably the weakest, and a waste of Rosemarie DeWitt's acting chops, and the introduction of the Gregson family's gay neighbors added nothing.The performances are what continue to elevate the series and compensate for any unevenness. Toni Colette continues to knock it out of the park, while playing what is really a series of distinct roles. (She's like a subtler Tracy Ullman.) And the actors who play Marshall and Kate are probably two of the best and most underrated actors on television.",4,Tweaked,1278547200,"07 8, 2010",2010,1848,"['loved', 'first', 'season', 'United', 'States', 'Tara', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'surpirsed', 'find', 'out', 'creator/lead', 'writer', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'happy', 'felt', 'need', 'not', 'revamp', 'perhaps', 'tweak', 'series', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'was', 'ai', ""n't"", 'broke', 'why', 'fix', 'right', 'main', 'difference', 'right', 'bat', 'Tara', 'titular', 'character', 'Season', '1', 'Tara', 'was', 'usually', 'subdued', 'frazzled', 'overwhelmed', 'embarrassed', 'was', 'alters', 'who', 'stole', 'show', 'Season', '2', 'show', 'taking', 'great', 'pains', 'make', 'Tara', 'more', 'interesting', 'even', 'alters', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'always', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'personalities', 'Tara', 'perhaps', 'better', 'off', 'playing', 'straight', 'man', 'letting', 'T', 'Buck', 'Alice', 'etc', 'play', 'outrageous', 'archetypes', ""'re"", 'worth.The', 'storylines', 'Season', '2', 'probably', 'succeed', '2/3', 'time', 'even', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'not', 'terrible', 'Tara', 'creation', 'alter', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'psychiatrist', 'one', 'season', 'best', 'storylines', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'revelations', 'finally', 'allow', 'Tara', 'find', 'source', 'DID', 'Buck', 'romance', 'barista', 'Marshall', 'awkward', 'attempt', 'heterosexuality', 'Kate', 'friendship', 'eccentric', 'artist', 'are', 'season', 'other', 'highlights', 'Charmaine', 'wedding', 'storyline', 'probably', 'weakest', 'waste', 'Rosemarie', 'DeWitt', 'acting', 'chops', 'introduction', 'Gregson', 'family', 'gay', 'neighbors', 'added', 'nothing.The', 'performances', 'are', 'what', 'continue', 'elevate', 'series', 'compensate', 'unevenness', 'Toni', 'Colette', 'knock', 'park', 'playing', 'what', 'really', 'series', 'distinct', 'roles', 'subtler', 'Tracy', 'Ullman', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Marshall', 'Kate', 'are', 'probably', 'two', 'best', 'most', 'underrated', 'actors', 'television']",N/A

This season contains some hilarious moments, including the introduction of several new alters (Shoshana, Tara's new therapist; and Chicken, Tara at age five). Some of the subplots are fantastic as well, including Marshall (Kier Gilchrist) finally coming to terms with his sexuality and Kate (Brie Larson) becoming cam-girl Princess Valhalla Hawkwind (which is a total She-Ra rip-off, but still awesome.)However, a lot of things happened this season that I didn't like. The character of Charmaine (Rosemarie DeWitt) has always annoyed me, and I hated her even more this season. She has the moral compass of a flea and is just a terrible person whose presence adds no value to the show, in my opinion. Also, Max (John Corbett) kind of goes off the deep end this season in several ways, and that really bothered me. I don't see how any man could put up with being married to Tara, but Max has always been great and then just sort of snapped in Season 2, and it seemed so out of character for him.We don't see as much of the original alters in Season 2. Buck is the one who appears most frequently, followed by Alice. I don't think T shows up all season, which is a major bummer. Finally, I kept waiting to get some major revelations about Tara's past in Season 2, and although we get a few, they aren't explained nearly as well as they could have been. I guess Showtime needs material to keep the show going for a few more seasons, but by the time the Season 2 finale wrapped up, I felt like the entire season had been very anticlimactic.I'll keep watching this show when Season 3 rolls around, but I hope they pick up the pace a little.",4,Tara is faltering...,1275955200,"06 8, 2010",2010,1830,"['still', 'show', 'very', 'much', 'opinion', 'United', 'States', 'Tara', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'Season', '1.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'Tara', 'season', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'including', 'introduction', 'several', 'new', 'alters', 'Shoshana', 'Tara', 'new', 'therapist', 'Chicken', 'Tara', 'age', 'five', 'subplots', 'are', 'fantastic', 'well', 'including', 'Marshall', 'Kier', 'Gilchrist', 'finally', 'coming', 'terms', 'sexuality', 'Kate', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'becoming', 'cam-girl', 'Princess', 'Valhalla', 'Hawkwind', 'total', 'She-Ra', 'rip-off', 'still', 'awesome', 'However', 'lot', 'things', 'happened', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'character', 'Charmaine', 'Rosemarie', 'DeWitt', 'always', 'annoyed', 'hated', 'even', 'more', 'season', 'moral', 'compass', 'flea', 'just', 'terrible', 'person', 'presence', 'value', 'show', 'opinion', 'Also', 'Max', 'John', 'Corbett', 'kind', 'deep', 'end', 'season', 'several', 'ways', 'really', 'bothered', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'man', 'could', 'put', 'up', 'being', 'married', 'Tara', 'Max', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'then', 'just', 'sort', 'snapped', 'Season', '2', 'seemed', 'so', 'character', 'him.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'as', 'much', 'original', 'alters', 'Season', '2', 'Buck', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'frequently', 'followed', 'Alice', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'T', 'up', 'season', 'major', 'bummer', 'Finally', 'kept', 'waiting', 'get', 'major', 'revelations', 'Tara', 'past', 'Season', '2', 'get', 'few', 'are', ""n't"", 'explained', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'guess', 'Showtime', 'material', 'keep', 'show', 'going', 'few', 'more', 'seasons', 'time', 'Season', '2', 'finale', 'wrapped', 'up', 'felt', 'entire', 'season', 'had', 'been', 'very', 'anticlimactic.I', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'watching', 'show', 'when', 'Season', '3', 'rolls', 'hope', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'little']",N/A

It is one of the best shows of the past ten years, and it is an honest tragedy that like many other incredible programs, it was canceled after only three seasons.If I was simply reviewing the second season of this show, this review would be a 4 out of 5, as while the season is good overall, it doesn't quite reach the perfection of seasons 1 and 3.  But the overall story arc and character development in this season was still quite good.However, I am not reviewing the show overall, nor the season on it's own.  I am reviewing the DVD release I bought, new, a few months ago of Season Two.  And the DVD release literally destroyed this season.  I don't know if I got a bum copy or if all DVDs had the same problem as mine, but I'm going to give an honest review of the DVD I purchased.First, the season, like I said, isn't great, but is good.  It further delves into the events from Tara's past that cause her problems, and it does a lot to show how her disorder is both strengthening and breaking the family at once.  Many heavy sub-plots are addressed, including marital infidelity, the appearance of new ""alters"", romance for Charmaine, Marshall and Kate, and other events that shake the family to it's core.  It was a good season, though some of the plotlines seemed forced and contrived, and the earlier episodes seemed to have moments that were only put in for shock value.  It began to feel like the creative team was sapped for ideas early on, but got a second wind as the season was beginning to wrap up.  But, all-in-all, worth it.Which is what makes the tragedy of the DVD all the more painful.First, the special features.  There's not much, a few featurettes, basically.  I'm a bit dissapointed by the special features for all three seasons, but I could forgive that.The audio is pretty good.  Menus, etc, all adequate.The real problem, which becomes the elephant in the corner anytime I watch the DVD with someone, though, is the god-awful picture quality.  The show looks abysmal on this DVD release.  It's not just a few problems, it's the entire show.  It took this review down to a 1.Every single episode suffers from what I can only call ""looking pirated.""  The show doesn't look like an official DVD release (even though it is, it was purchased from a reliable vendor, looks exactly like the image and had all of the appropriate Showtime Channel inserts, adverts, stickers, etc on and in the packaging), it looks like a very rushed DVD rip that was highly compressed.  YouTube videos look better.The image will start out looking fine at the beginning of each episode, but within seconds, once any sort of movement begins, the image quickly becomes blurred and ""pixelated"" beyond belief.  Faces will lose all detail, leaving characters looking like mannequins.  I can often only make out the eyes and mouths of the characters.  Colors will dull and fade.  Movement causes a nasty ""trail"" effect at times.  The focus seems to randomly change- things will look in focus, then blurred, then back in focus, then turn into a mass of ""colored pixels"" before snapping back to normal, then blurred, constantly.  In the last two episodes, I even noticed a dark blue/black ""glitch bar"" flash on screen two or three times.  I had just watched the season on demand not long before ordering the DVD, and on TV, it looked absolutely gorgeous.  This DVD looks like the disc had been scratched and dragged through the dirt.Thinking it was perhaps my Blu-Ray player not liking the disc or my old TV, I tested it on four different TV's (one standard deff and three different high deff TV's), and on five different players (two standard DVD players, a DVD recorder/player, a PS3, and a Sony Blu-Ray player), and every combination produced the exact same disgusting look.I repeatedly checked the discs- absolutely spotless (it was purchased new, and had no scratches at all).So, based on my DVD, I have to say this is a very bad DVD set.  Which was surprising, as Seasons One and Three both looked great on DVD.  I'm not prepared to buy this season again, under the assumption I just somehow got a bum copy, until I know whether or not this is true.  Please, if anyone else has the DVD and didn't have this problem, let me know in a comment, because I feel extremely ripped off by Showtime.",1,"The Rare Fantastic, Near-Flawless Show...
