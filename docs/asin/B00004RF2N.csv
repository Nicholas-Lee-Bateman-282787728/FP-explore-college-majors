The characters are passable, w/ only a slightly high annoyance factor. As FM movies go, this one is more ""serious"" than say, HIDEOUS or HEAD OF THE FAMILY.

548431,A1Z9BYJ6Z7AZ71,B00004RF2N,Buzz N' Frog,"[14, 15]","I have grown to love and sometimes hate Full Moon over the years, because alot of their past efforts have failed. Many of Full Moon's movies usually have no plot, boring, terrible acting, or is just plain stupid. That was the not the case with Shrieker. Shrieker is full on fun suspense and slasher! It builds up to the deadly climax when the Shrieker is going to get some one! It makes you wonder who is it going to get next? Full Moon have ripped off of some movies in the past and Hellraiser was one of them. Somewhere in the opening credits it shows these markings and has someone talking. One of those markings were the puzzle box from Hellraiser. It wasn't shown in the rest of the movie so Full Moon didn't ripp off Hellraiser in the plot. That was the only putdown in this movie, because they ran out of ideas so they used the puzzle box from Hellraiser. I have seen other movies that have ripped off of other peoples ideas. For example Jason Goes To Hell : The Final Friday somewhere in the middle of that movie someone finds a book which turns out to be the Book of the Dead from Sam Raimi's gory cult classic Evil Dead. The Shrieker was an awesome looking creature and killed people in a disgusting way. I loved it!

548432,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B00004RF2N,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","Definitely horror-lite, Shrieker is a movie that welcomes ridicule.  Point of fact, the Shrieker rarely shrieks.  At times, it sounds more like a dog, once it sounded decidedly piggish.  Not exactly the stuff of nightmares.  The plot suffers from too many comparisons to other horror films (not the least of which was Curse of the Demon).  The acting is uneven to say the least, with Tanya Dempsey (Clark) the worst of the lot, giving a flat performance that completely betrays any emotion she's trying to produce.  I've seen house flies do a better job.  At the other end of the spectrum is Parry Shen (who actually went on to have a lengthy career as an actor), going beyond the call of duty by overdoing every scene he's in.  The dialog is stilted, leaving everyone sounding unnatural.  The setup is lost during the opening credits, some mumbo jumbo about alchemists and a traveler between worlds, appeasing a master, some abomination, marking five people for sacrifice, yadda-yadda-yadda.  And wouldn't you know it, five people are squatting in an abandoned hospital just as a sixth person is asked to join their unlucky number.  But wait, what's this, there's a seventh person hiding on the premises!  An expert in all things Shrieker!  That doesn't sound too suspicious.  Conveniently, they all forget rule number one: never investigate scary noises when it's better to delegate.  Along the way we learn a nasty purpose for calligraphy, that communism isn't all it's cracked up to be, and just because you've given to going shirtless doesn't mean you're obviously gay.  Where there's smoke there's bound to be obscure symbols burning on the floor.

548438,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B00004RF2N,Sid the Elf,"[1, 1]","For a handful of months the B viewings have dropped quite significantly pretty much due to a lack of time. So when a week off of work made itself present there was no other option then to find a good old 90's horror B to enjoy. With the rain pouring down outside we stumbled upon Shrieker which we had been wanting to view for quite sometime. Finding out it was a Full Moon production came as a nice surprise and solidified the decision. Full Moon has provided us with years of low quality enjoyment that only a small following understand. Let's face it, their movies are not for the conventional viewer by any means. You have to go in with the bar set so low or else you'll find no pleasure it the film's B goodness. Luckily our vast experience in the B arts has left us with a tolerance for just about anything, leaving us open to enjoy most films that come our way. With Shrieker you will be exposed to a serious lack of acting and not enough Shrieker action. When you have a two faced mutant creature, you want to see him most of the time and not just in the end.Shrieker starts out with two hospital workers getting shredded apart by a mysterious creature that was lurking in the depths of the building. Awkwardly we flash forward some years later and meet a crew of college students who have found a solution for student housing. They've come up with the genius decision to live in the abandoned hospital instead of living on campus. Please don't allow all the logical questions to dominate your mind at this point, it's of no value. To enjoy this film you must check your brain at the door. Clark, who is a female, is the newest recruit to live the dream of a homeless student in the abandoned hospital. She's sworn to secrecy before she's allowed in the squatters club, being it's so exclusive. From here we hit quite a slow pace of horrid acting and a huge lack of Shrieker action. Clark winds up wandering down to the basement and discovers another squatter who isn't part of the group she's with. Turns out this weirdo is dwelling in the basement attempting to summon the Shrieker from the underworld, and eventually does so. Once the Shriker makes his appearance the bad actors start dropping like flies. The creature itself is quite entertaining and by far the film's best actor, despite it's only dialog is loud shrieking. In the end Clark finds a way to send the creature back to the underworld, and decides to inhabit a different abandoned building to complete her college education.In the end Shrieker was very enjoyable film for a one time watch and a solid entry from the Full Moon franchise. It's leaps and bounds above the garbage the company pumps out now. Don't be bringing that trash in here, not in my house.  Most people wouldn't have been able to watch this movie without dosing off throughout the middle as it does get quite slow. The story really drags, but the poorly delivered lines were entertaining enough to keep us engaged. Plus we were waiting for a Shrieker appearance which we felt would happen at any given time. What we really needed was a heavy dose of creature action. Movies like to keep the creature hidden to add suspense, but when it's a low budget, direct to video entry the creature should dominate the screen. It would have been better just to follow the creature around as it grunted and screamed all day long as opposed to a crew of un-likeable college students. Especially students that are content to live like the dregs of society to save on student housing funds. It's obviously such a ridiculous plot, but that in lies the charm of the 90's horror B.",4,I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac today,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,3606,"['handful', 'months', 'B', 'viewings', 'have', 'dropped', 'quite', 'significantly', 'pretty', 'much', 'due', 'lack', 'time', 'So', 'when', 'week', 'work', 'made', 'present', 'was', 'other', 'option', 'then', 'find', 'good', 'old', '90', 'horror', 'B', 'enjoy', 'rain', 'pouring', 'down', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'Shrieker', 'had', 'been', 'wanting', 'view', 'quite', 'sometime', 'Finding', 'was', 'Full', 'Moon', 'production', 'came', 'nice', 'surprise', 'solidified', 'decision', 'Full', 'Moon', 'provided', 'years', 'low', 'quality', 'enjoyment', 'only', 'small', 'following', 'understand', 'Let', 'face', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'conventional', 'viewer', 'means', 'have', 'go', 'bar', 'set', 'so', 'low', 'else', ""'ll"", 'find', 'pleasure', 'film', 'B', 'goodness', 'Luckily', 'vast', 'experience', 'B', 'arts', 'left', 'tolerance', 'just', 'anything', 'leaving', 'open', 'enjoy', 'most', 'films', 'come', 'way', 'Shrieker', 'will', 'be', 'exposed', 'serious', 'lack', 'acting', 'not', 'enough', 'Shrieker', 'action', 'When', 'have', 'two', 'faced', 'mutant', 'creature', 'want', 'see', 'most', 'time', 'not', 'just', 'end.Shrieker', 'out', 'two', 'hospital', 'workers', 'getting', 'shredded', 'apart', 'mysterious', 'creature', 'was', 'lurking', 'depths', 'building', 'Awkwardly', 'flash', 'forward', 'years', 'later', 'meet', 'crew', 'college', 'students', 'who', 'have', 'found', 'solution', 'student', 'housing', ""'ve"", 'come', 'up', 'genius', 'decision', 'live', 'abandoned', 'hospital', 'instead', 'living', 'campus', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'logical', 'questions', 'dominate', 'mind', 'point', 'value', 'enjoy', 'film', 'must', 'check', 'brain', 'door', 'Clark', 'who', 'female', 'newest', 'recruit', 'live', 'dream', 'homeless', 'student', 'abandoned', 'hospital', 'sworn', 'secrecy', 'allowed', 'squatters', 'club', 'being', 'so', 'exclusive', 'here', 'hit', 'quite', 'slow', 'pace', 'horrid', 'acting', 'huge', 'lack', 'Shrieker', 'action', 'Clark', 'up', 'wandering', 'basement', 'squatter', 'who', ""n't"", 'part', 'group', 'out', 'weirdo', 'dwelling', 'basement', 'attempting', 'summon', 'Shrieker', 'underworld', 'eventually', 'so', 'Shriker', 'appearance', 'bad', 'actors', 'start', 'dropping', 'flies', 'creature', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'far', 'film', 'best', 'actor', 'only', 'dialog', 'loud', 'shrieking', 'end', 'Clark', 'way', 'send', 'creature', 'back', 'underworld', 'inhabit', 'different', 'abandoned', 'building', 'complete', 'college', 'end', 'Shrieker', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'one', 'time', 'watch', 'solid', 'entry', 'Full', 'Moon', 'franchise', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'garbage', 'company', 'out', 'now', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'bringing', 'trash', 'here', 'not', 'house', 'Most', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'able', 'watch', 'movie', 'dosing', 'off', 'middle', 'get', 'quite', 'slow', 'story', 'really', 'drags', 'poorly', 'delivered', 'lines', 'were', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'keep', 'engaged', 'were', 'waiting', 'Shrieker', 'appearance', 'felt', 'would', 'happen', 'given', 'time', 'What', 'really', 'needed', 'was', 'heavy', 'dose', 'creature', 'action', 'Movies', 'keep', 'creature', 'hidden', 'add', 'suspense', 'when', 'low', 'budget', 'direct', 'video', 'entry', 'creature', 'should', 'dominate', 'screen', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'just', 'follow', 'creature', 'grunted', 'screamed', 'day', 'long', 'as', 'opposed', 'crew', 'un-likeable', 'college', 'students', 'Especially', 'students', 'are', 'content', 'live', 'dregs', 'society', 'save', 'student', 'housing', 'funds', 'obviously', 'such', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'charm', '90', 'horror', 'B']",Shrieker VHS

For me it seemed different than most of the formulaic teen/college student die one by one.  No, it seemed to me that more thought went into this movie than that and I did appreciated that.  The acting was good, and I think there was real chemistry between the actors, the setting was cool from my perspective, and  well thought out.  I like the idea all in all.So, you have a 'massacre' that occurred 50 years ago in a hospital(the opening scene), two young orderly's loose their lives to a creature.  As credits roll you learn something about the creature and where it comes from and why.  The movie then jumps ahead 50 years.  You have broke college students squatting in the old hospital complex, a very cool idea really, they each have a different major, one or two you'd want if you wanted power and water in an old building.  There is a mystery person in the basement, and someone isn't what they seem.  Someone wants to bring back the Shrieker for their own nefarious reasons and chaos ensues.To be sure it's a B monster movie, but there's nothing wrong with that.  We love B-horror movies!!

I'm going to have to say 2.5 for this one.,2,Eh...,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,292,"['was', ""n't"", 'really', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'expecting', 'horror', 'thought', 'was', 'more', 'thriller/suspense', 'was', 'lot', 'dialouge', 'overall', 'movie', 'went', 'too', 'slow', 'action', 'few', 'far', 'film', 'grainy', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'say', '2.5', 'one']",Shrieker VHS
