It is not a profound film, a biting satire, or a gripping drama.  It is what it is....fluff.  Having been in a sorority before, I know that the film's treatment of Elle's beloved Delta Nu is over the top, but little else is, including her treatment at the hands of the Harvard law student body.The film has its high points...the liposuction conversation, Elle arriving at Harvard for orientation (Woods, comma Elle), and her conversation with her family about her future.  It has its low points as well...and its low points are VERY low indeed.  I know Elle needed a friend, but why on earth did they pick a dowdy, stupid beautician to be her friend?  My god, that woman was irritating.  The &quot;bend and snap&quot; scene shouldn't have just been left out of the film, it should have been burned so it couldn't be included in a future director's cut.The film is predictable....you know Elle will win back her snobbish boyfriend, you know she'll win over the Harvard elite, and you know going into the film's final scenes that she will easily win the case.This film is great fun on a dreary Sunday afternoon when there's nothing else on.  I wouldn't buy it unless you're a big Reese Witherspoon fan...if you're not, I'd save my money and just rent it from Blockbuster.",3,Reese again does wonders with poor material,1014681600,"02 26, 2002",2002,1346,"['start', 'finish', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'piece', 'brain', 'candy', 'not', 'profound', 'film', 'biting', 'satire', 'gripping', 'drama', 'what', '.fluff', 'Having', 'been', 'sorority', 'know', 'film', 'treatment', 'Elle', 'beloved', 'Delta', 'Nu', 'top', 'little', 'else', 'including', 'treatment', 'hands', 'Harvard', 'law', 'student', 'body.The', 'film', 'high', 'points', 'liposuction', 'conversation', 'Elle', 'arriving', 'Harvard', 'orientation', 'Woods', 'comma', 'Elle', 'conversation', 'family', 'future', 'low', 'points', 'as', 'well', 'low', 'points', 'are', 'VERY', 'low', 'indeed', 'know', 'Elle', 'needed', 'friend', 'why', 'earth', 'did', 'pick', 'dowdy', 'stupid', 'beautician', 'be', 'friend', 'My', 'god', 'woman', 'was', 'irritating', 'quot', 'bend', 'snap', 'quot', 'scene', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'just', 'been', 'left', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'burned', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'included', 'future', 'director', 'cut.The', 'film', 'predictable', '.you', 'know', 'Elle', 'will', 'win', 'back', 'snobbish', 'boyfriend', 'know', ""'ll"", 'win', 'Harvard', 'elite', 'know', 'going', 'film', 'final', 'scenes', 'will', 'easily', 'win', 'case.This', 'film', 'great', 'fun', 'dreary', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'when', 'nothing', 'else', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', ""'re"", 'big', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'fan', ""'re"", 'not', ""'d"", 'save', 'money', 'just', 'rent', 'Blockbuster']",Legally Blonde

Reese Witherspoon is great, the dialog is fun, the characters are fun, and the plot, while adhering to every formulaic lawyer movie cliche in the book, is nonethless quite enjoyable.Where this DVD really shines, tough, is in the special features.  I'm not generally a big fan of DVD special features, but these ones are really worth watching.  I especially liked the &quot;trivia track&quot;, which adds &quot;pop-up video&quot;-style trivia bubbles throughout the film.Another nice feature was the inclusion of crew commentary in addition to the one by the director and Reese Witherspoon.  The crew can give a completely different perspective on the making of any movie, and I'd like to see more DVDs include this kind of material.I also liked &quot;The Hair That Ate Hollywood&quot;, a short documentary on what they did to Reese Witherspoon's hair for the movie.  I never realized just how much work could go into making a beautiful blonde continue to look like a beautiful blonde, and it makes for an entertaining short.My only complaint on the special features is that they put the supplemental material on the flip side of the DVD, rather than on a second DVD.

671508,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005O5CM,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I love Reese Witherspoon.  A lot of my friends kind of hate her, but I think she is comedic brilliance, and her creation of Elle Woods is just one of her many flawless brush strokes.  In fact, she alone takes this rather generic and at times reaching script and makes it one of the most delightful film experiences of the 00's.I see its flaws, but they are forgivable thanks to Witherspoon.Now, the general concept of this film is that of a young and airheaded hot chick named Elle who finds herself dumped by her boyfriend when he goes to Law School.  In an attempt to win him back, Elle decides to attend the same school and prove that she is more than a pretty face.  She meets lots of opposition in the form of a spiteful `new' girlfriend and a slew of fellow students who consider her a joke.  Instead of buckling though, Elle buckles down and puts in the work, proving to herself and to those who doubted her that her head is not as empty as they thought it was.Like I said, this movie is a lot of fun.  It does have its dry moments though.  I personally found a lot of the `hair salon' sub-plot to be rather dull and distracting from the real story, which revolved around the school and the case Elle finds herself working on.  The predictable yet tacky teacher/student scenario that unfolds in the end was a little unnecessary, but what else do you expect from these kinds of films.Predictable.Thankfully, amidst all the familiarity lies a fantastic performance by a beacon of light that just illuminates every aspect of this film.  Reese Witherspoon takes the generic airhead girlfriend role and turns it on its head with brilliantly constructed, multi-layered character development.  She has her comedic timing down pat, making almost every facial twitch a comedic affair; but she also understands that dramatic tension needed to make Elle a relatable and sympathetic character.Like I said, multi-layered.As great as Witherspoon is (and I really mean great), she is not the only person here who puts in a commendable performance.  In fact, the entire ensemble works really well together.  I love Selma Blaire here.  I actually think she is a sorely underrated actress who I wish would get some better roles.  Her doe-like eyes balance out her permanent `snob' facial expression that helps add layers of depth to her cold exterior.  I heart her.  Luke Wilson and Matthew Davis are serviceable `boy toys' here, but the females definitely outshine here, including the hilarious Jennifer Coolidge (shining despite her dull plot points), Holland Taylor and Ali Larter.  Victor Garber is always a welcome addition to any ensemble as far as I'm concerned, despite my reservations on his eventual character arc.Flawed by highly engaging and a lot of fun, this spectacularly acted teen comedy certainly deserves a place in any DVD library!",4,Don't judge a book by its cover...,1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,2840,"['love', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'lot', 'friends', 'kind', 'hate', 'think', 'comedic', 'brilliance', 'creation', 'Elle', 'Woods', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'flawless', 'brush', 'strokes', 'fact', 'alone', 'rather', 'generic', 'times', 'reaching', 'script', 'one', 'most', 'delightful', 'film', 'experiences', ""00's.I"", 'see', 'flaws', 'are', 'forgivable', 'thanks', 'Witherspoon.Now', 'general', 'concept', 'film', 'young', 'airheaded', 'hot', 'chick', 'named', 'Elle', 'who', 'dumped', 'boyfriend', 'when', 'Law', 'School', 'attempt', 'win', 'back', 'Elle', 'attend', 'same', 'school', 'prove', 'more', 'pretty', 'face', 'lots', 'opposition', 'form', 'spiteful', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'slew', 'fellow', 'students', 'who', 'consider', 'joke', 'Instead', 'buckling', 'Elle', 'down', 'work', 'proving', 'herself', 'who', 'doubted', 'head', 'not', 'as', 'empty', 'thought', 'said', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'have', 'dry', 'moments', 'personally', 'found', 'lot', 'hair', 'salon', 'sub-plot', 'be', 'rather', 'dull', 'distracting', 'real', 'story', 'revolved', 'school', 'case', 'Elle', 'working', 'predictable', 'yet', 'tacky', 'teacher/student', 'scenario', 'end', 'was', 'little', 'unnecessary', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'expect', 'kinds', 'films.Predictable.Thankfully', 'familiarity', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'beacon', 'light', 'just', 'aspect', 'film', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'generic', 'airhead', 'girlfriend', 'role', 'head', 'brilliantly', 'constructed', 'multi-layered', 'character', 'development', 'comedic', 'timing', 'down', 'pat', 'making', 'almost', 'facial', 'twitch', 'comedic', 'affair', 'also', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'needed', 'make', 'Elle', 'relatable', 'sympathetic', 'character.Like', 'said', 'multi-layered.As', 'great', 'Witherspoon', 'really', 'mean', 'great', 'not', 'only', 'person', 'here', 'who', 'commendable', 'performance', 'fact', 'entire', 'ensemble', 'works', 'really', 'well', 'together', 'love', 'Selma', 'Blaire', 'here', 'actually', 'think', 'sorely', 'underrated', 'actress', 'who', 'wish', 'would', 'get', 'better', 'roles', 'doe-like', 'eyes', 'balance', 'permanent', 'snob', 'facial', 'expression', 'add', 'layers', 'depth', 'cold', 'exterior', 'heart', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Matthew', 'Davis', 'are', 'serviceable', 'boy', 'toys', 'here', 'females', 'definitely', 'outshine', 'here', 'including', 'hilarious', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'shining', 'dull', 'plot', 'points', 'Holland', 'Taylor', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'always', 'welcome', 'addition', 'ensemble', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'reservations', 'eventual', 'character', 'arc.Flawed', 'highly', 'engaging', 'lot', 'fun', 'spectacularly', 'acted', 'teen', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'place', 'DVD', 'library']",Legally Blonde

The critic i read found the film's solace centered around the star and the story not being much...and this is true it is a kind of stereotyped story but if you listen to the audiotracks it is laced with serious aspects to it. I do congratulate the makers on putting intelligent commentary with such distinguishing comments as 'experience''contrast''atmosphere''socratic method''self realisation'...i dont know the book but i pioked up on these themes while watching the film,and these are all things to look at when watching a film,and right after i watched it i clicked on elvis at amazon,it must be all that 60's type clothing andinterest in fashions,that i recall from all my elvis movies years ago,and we can watch this film as those,in terms of fashions and hairstyles,and how people are reinvented in this way,and look in vogue,like 'elle' in the film at the start,so there's much more to the film then meets the eye and the contrast between california and boston sights,and the changes in atmosphere. At the beginning of film the Reese character is interested in latching onto a politician and becoming a 'part' of him, a political wife,but he drops her and being a smart person,she goes to harvard what with her 4.0 gpa and there is much comment on the school system,and how she begins to not want to be part of something else but to value herself,and begins life and relationships from there,how she becomes a modern woman,or better person,and this is gone over in the commentary. The film works though since the drama and conversation is good and dialogue funny,and ideas are never present but realized through the characters and not as ideas...there is much legalese and the court sceneswell realized and realistic,and listen to the song at film's end. Reese elicits and gets our sympathy in this film,or the film fails,you have to bond with characters in films or they dont work,perhaps what critic found in her being the whole show. Good minor characters are the hairdresser,and the small dog. Of course this great concern on self realization in modern life may make us wonder about the value of children in modern life,who are not surprising absent from this film not even pictured,we are too immersed in realizing ourselves which not only effect the character but the producers of this film,which is a realistic pastiche of our world.",4,Star uplifts material...good fun!,1333584000,"04 5, 2012",2012,2471,"['say', 'good', 'fun', 'comedy', 'supposed', 'be', 'fun', 'i', 'imagine', 'great', 'success', 'sequel', 'was', 'produced', 'critic', 'i', 'read', 'found', 'film', 'solace', 'centered', 'star', 'story', 'not', 'being', 'much', 'true', 'kind', 'stereotyped', 'story', 'listen', 'audiotracks', 'laced', 'serious', 'aspects', 'do', 'congratulate', 'makers', 'putting', 'intelligent', 'commentary', 'such', 'distinguishing', 'comments', ""'experience"", 'contrast', 'atmosphere', 'socratic', 'method', 'realisation', 'dont', 'know', 'book', 'i', 'pioked', 'up', 'themes', 'watching', 'film', 'are', 'things', 'look', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'right', 'i', 'watched', 'clicked', 'elvis', 'amazon', 'must', 'be', '60', 'type', 'clothing', 'andinterest', 'fashions', 'i', 'recall', 'elvis', 'movies', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'watch', 'film', 'terms', 'fashions', 'hairstyles', 'how', 'people', 'are', 'reinvented', 'way', 'look', 'vogue', ""'elle"", 'film', 'start', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'then', 'eye', 'contrast', 'california', 'boston', 'sights', 'changes', 'atmosphere', 'beginning', 'film', 'Reese', 'character', 'interested', 'latching', 'politician', 'becoming', ""'part"", ""'"", 'political', 'wife', 'being', 'smart', 'person', 'harvard', 'what', '4.0', 'gpa', 'much', 'comment', 'school', 'system', 'how', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'part', 'something', 'else', 'value', 'life', 'relationships', 'there', 'how', 'modern', 'woman', 'better', 'person', 'gone', 'commentary', 'film', 'drama', 'conversation', 'good', 'dialogue', 'funny', 'ideas', 'are', 'never', 'present', 'realized', 'characters', 'not', 'ideas', 'much', 'legalese', 'court', 'sceneswell', 'realized', 'realistic', 'listen', 'song', 'film', 'end', 'Reese', 'elicits', 'sympathy', 'film', 'film', 'have', 'bond', 'characters', 'films', 'dont', 'work', 'perhaps', 'what', 'critic', 'found', 'being', 'whole', 'show', 'Good', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'hairdresser', 'small', 'dog', 'course', 'great', 'concern', 'self', 'realization', 'modern', 'life', 'may', 'make', 'wonder', 'value', 'children', 'modern', 'life', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'surprising', 'absent', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'pictured', 'are', 'too', 'immersed', 'realizing', 'not', 'only', 'effect', 'character', 'producers', 'film', 'realistic', 'pastiche', 'world']",Legally Blonde

671526,A3CBVOWBZIGNH0,B00005O5CM,Bill Fyffe Jr.,"[0, 0]","Walking through the aisles of the video store on a Friday night is not an exciting adventure when most of the movies are gone.  Looking at the rows of empty boxes, the remaining videos were surely second-rate.  The mood at the moment was for an exciting thriller, until the one desired was gone as well.  Glossing over the remainder of misfits, LEGALLY BLONDE was still in stock.  Reaching up to take the movie, I quickly withdrew it with the notion that possibly someone had returned the one I really had a hunkering to see.  However, the idea was shot down as the clerk said, &quot;Sorry sir.&quot;  With all the resolve one could muster, the hand shaking as though it was working against its master, once again reached for LEGALLY BLONDE.Darn it!  Those first impressions are not always right, you know, thinking this movie was CLUELESS II.  It was much more than a dumb blonde movie, but remarkably a refreshing 'you can do anything you set your mind to do' film.Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) has everything going for her.  She is a peppy Southern California beauty, runner-up in a Miss Hawaiian Tropic Contest, sorority president, and carries a 4.0 GPA at UCLA in Fashion Designing.  Moreover, she is optimistic of becoming the wife of Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis), a handsome and successful young man from a prominent family of lawyers, whose desire is to be a senator by age 30.Expecting Warner to pop the question, Elle is devastated to hear that he wants to end the relationship.  His reason is even more shattering; &quot;He needs a Jackie, not a Marilyn.&quot;  In other words, Elle carries a social stigma and persona that the world will see, and it is not the style of the Huntington tradition.  She is 'illegally blond.'Being an 'illegal blond' in Warner's eyes, Elle is determined to follow him to Harvard Law School and regain his affection.  With her tenacious spirit and resolve, she passes the entrance exam, and produces a creatively funny autobiographical video for the school officials, to which they acknowledge Harvard's need for 'diversity.'  Elle is in.  Now, she must prove to Warner, the world, but more importantly to herself, that she is LEGALLY BLONDE.Reese Witherspoon played the role of the blonde California girl with a lot of moxie.  Her character was not the CLUELESS Cher Horowitz, played by Alicia Silverstone in 1995, but a smarter goal-driven blonde.  Sad to say, Silverstone, typecast with her dumb blonde character, never really rebounded from it.  The same type thing happened with Raquel Welch, who had a bit part in this film as Mrs. Windham-Vandermark.  It is ironic that Welch was in this flick for she was typecast as a buxom beauty in her own career. One can only hope Reese will not suffer the same, because all three ladies are terrific actresses.The movie watcher cannot help falling in love with Elle for she is more than dropdead gorgeous, but smart, determined, and compassionate.  She struggles in her relationship with fellow law students and professors, but extends a hand to other outcasts in the film such as Paulette (Jennifer Coolidge), the divorced manicurist, and David the Dork (Oz Perkins).  Moreover, Elle personifies integrity as she withholds the alibi of her client from her law professor.In conclusion, this is a surprisingly good movie, especially for first-time director, Robert Luketic; however, without the performance of Witherspoon the film would have been almost illegal.  The movie is terribly predictable, but fun and entertaining.

When this movie was made, blondes were one of the few groups left in America that it was safe to bash, belittle and discriminate against.  Someone decided enough was enough.The woman they selected to lead the fight could not have been better chosen.  Reese Witherspoon had already played characters that, whatever else they might be, were not ones to take any crap from anybody.  Reese played Elle with all the vulnerability, all the tender-heartedness that a real Elle would have; but when it came to getting what she wanted, she was prepared to go a long way, even if it meant buying a computer (Ugh!) and going to law school (Double-ugh!).But a strange thing happened along the way.  Elle discovered that she was not as dumb as she thought she was.  She could compete with the best of them and still keep her own values.  By the end of this journey, Elle (and the viewer) has learned that sometimes what or who you wanted wasn't as great as you thought he was, and you can do a lot better, because now you are more capable, more knowledgeable, and smarter than you were a few years before.The filmmakers obviously didn't want to be so uncool as to take sides, so there is still a lot of blonde bashing in this movie; but there are moments that are funny, moments that are touching, and an ending that is satisfying.Reese Witherspoon became a mega-star with this movie, and she wasn't one to quit either.

BUT it does so with lightness and fun and I'm sure you will be able to tell those who take themselves too seriously by their reaction to this movie.I LOVED it (no, I'm not blonde, rich, super smart, gay, a society girl, trailer trash OR a lawyer)! And I'll try to tell you why I love this movie in under 1000 words.Reece Witherspoon portrays Elle Woods(blonde, California college girl and fashion major just looking to get married as quick as possible to the man of her dreams) with such a deft touch that one would think she IS that girl--if they hadn't seen some of her other film work. Elle loves Warner Huntington III whose plans for the future are law school at Harvard and then politics and a ""serious"" minded finance/wife. Beautiful Elle doesn't fit the image, so Warner dumps her---On Valentine's Day....during dinner at a lovely restaurant....where Elle Thought he was going to propose!!  OOOOH....if there is one lesson guys should learn from this movie it is: Don't mess with a beautiful blonde on the Holy Grail of Romance Days or you could live to regret it.In usual Elle fashion, she deduces that in order to 'get' her man, all she has to do is go to Harvard Law and so she proceeds to plan B. Just....Nail down an acceptable SAT, video a killer essay to Wow the admissions committee and accomplish it all without breaking a nail. Before you can say ""Let's shop for whole new wardrobe"" Elle is at Harvard asking for her Activities and Mixers schedule.Favorite moment: When Elle gets chosen to be on Callahan's legal team for a high profile murder trial. You can practically see Elle changing from ditzy dreamer to determined achiever.There are so many well crafted performers I had a harder time than usual picking favorites. However, two that really shine for me are: Jennifer Coolidge as Elle's friend and manicurist, Paulette Bonafont&eacute; and Holland Taylor's turn as Professor Stromwell. Luke Wilson was perfect for Emmett (he does 'nice, decent guy' so well)Legally Blonde is an affirmation that people can generally do a lot of the things that are important to them.

Newman ""moodindigo2""","[3, 4]","If there were 1/2 ratings, I would have granted an extra half-star if only for the moxie and flair for fun acting that Reese Witherspoon displays in Legally Blonde.  An absurd storyline is carried by the actress in a script that fits Ms. Reese tighter than the designer outfits made into a running joke in the film.Though ably directed and acted by a supporting cast including Luke Wilson and a chihuahua, 5 star storyline it is not.  This movie is for fun, not for keeps.  Yet, as weak as the foundation may be in Legally Blonde, I found myself smiling at the antics of Elle Woods (Reese W.), a grown up version of Alicia Silverstone's Clueless character.  The sorority depictions were frightenly parallel to the one's I recall in college, which only made the stereotype more humourous.

I watched the movie and there's nothing dumb about Elle Woods.  To me, she's brought up with confidence in herself.  Don't know who embedded this strong belief in one's self in Elle Woods.  But it's there, so evidently portrayed by Miss Witherspoon.  She's not a bit self-conscious showing up with her own west coast fashion sense in the east coast Harvard Law campus and she's not a bit ashamed of who she is.  Although her failed relationship had temporarily set her back and the people she encountered in Harvard Law had tried to put her down and belittle her (they almost succeeded), her healthy dose of self-esteem came to her rescue every time.It's a far-fetched comedy by all means but Miss Witherspoon always came prepared for her roles with a great deal of understanding into their psyche, motivation, and character development.  It's her grounded portrayal of Elle Woods that made this movie a fun movie watching experience.This blonde is no dumb blonde.

Directed by Robert Luketic, it is light-hearted and funny.PLOT SUMMARY: Elle Woods (Witherspoon) is your typical southern California blonde: she attends college, majors in Fashion Designing, and likes to get manicures. One night, her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), takes her out on a big date, and she and all her friends get excited, because they think he is going to propose to her. Instead, it turns out that Warner wants to dump her, because he'll be attending Harvard Law School in the fall and is looking for a more ""serious"" girl to marry, if he is ever going to become sentor. Heartbroken, Elle is furious and becomes depressed. But soon, Elle discovers that the only way to get her man back is to go to Harvard Law...a subject she knows little about. Elle is determinded to prove Warner wrong; that she CAN be smart. Surprisingly enough, Elle is accepted into the school. As soon as she gets to Harvard, however, she immediately stands out from the rest of the crowd, considering her wild fashion style and ultimate perkiness. But then, Elle has an encounter with Warner, and is surprised to learn that he has gotten engaged to a very preppy Harvard Law student, Vivian (Selma Blair). Vivian doesn't like Elle at all, and tries to make Elle's Harvard experience as miserable as possible, in hopes that she will find out that the school isn't right for her and leaves. Also, Elle is usually unprepared for classes (which also turn out to be miserable experiences), and Warner just can't seem to notice her. Meanwhile, Elle, upset with the way things are going, goes to get a manicure done and befriends the woman who gives her the manicure. This woman is lonely and depressed after getting a divorce from her husband and not getting a fair share in property custody. So Elle tries to help the woman get back what's hers from her husband. Also, while all this is going on, the woman tells Elle that if she wants her man back, then she must work hard to get him, so Elle decides to become serious with her work. She is surprised to find that she is actually improving, especially when one of her professors, Professor Callahan (Victor Garber), asks her, along with a few other students--including Warner and Vivian--to help him with an assignment. The assignment turns out to be a murder case. The accused? A former president of the soroity house Elle used to live in at her old college. Elle knows that the girl is innocent of the crime, but no one on her team will believe her. So Elle is determinded to solve the puzzle of the case and get her friend out of jail. By this time, she maybe starting to lose interest in Warner, for another guy has come into her life, Emmett (Luke Wilson), who is assisting Callahan on the trial.OVERALL THOUGHTS: I personally loved ""Legally Blonde"". The acting is superb by the entire cast, especially Reese--she ultimately shines, the script is clever and humorous, and is not offensive or dark. Since I am a Boston native, I have true appreciation for this film, since I'm always seeing preppy Harvard students whenever I visit Harvard Square (lol). The directing is awesome and it's just a fun film. You can enjoy it even if you are not blonde-haired! It's very girlie, but ""Legally Blonde"" will have you laughing away. The DVD is also nicely packaged, because the bonus features inlcude deleted scenes with introductions, exclusive featurettes, a Hoku music video, audio commentary, and trivia track.I highly recommend ""Legally Blonde"".Score:100/100A+",5,A very BLONDE triumph!,1041724800,"01 5, 2003",2003,3600,"['Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'stars', 'charming', 'comedy', 'finding', 'ones', 'self', 'just', 'being', 'who', 'are', 'Directed', 'Robert', 'Luketic', 'light-hearted', 'funny.PLOT', 'SUMMARY', 'Elle', 'Woods', 'Witherspoon', 'typical', 'southern', 'California', 'blonde', 'college', 'majors', 'Fashion', 'Designing', 'likes', 'get', 'manicures', 'One', 'night', 'boyfriend', 'Warner', 'Matthew', 'Davis', 'out', 'big', 'date', 'friends', 'get', 'excited', 'think', 'going', 'propose', 'Instead', 'out', 'Warner', 'dump', ""'ll"", 'be', 'attending', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'fall', 'looking', 'more', 'serious', 'girl', 'marry', 'ever', 'going', 'become', 'sentor', 'Heartbroken', 'Elle', 'furious', 'becomes', 'depressed', 'soon', 'Elle', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'man', 'back', 'go', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'subject', 'little', 'Elle', 'determinded', 'prove', 'Warner', 'wrong', 'CAN', 'be', 'smart', 'Surprisingly', 'enough', 'Elle', 'accepted', 'school', 'As', 'soon', 'Harvard', 'however', 'immediately', 'out', 'rest', 'crowd', 'considering', 'wild', 'fashion', 'style', 'ultimate', 'perkiness', 'then', 'Elle', 'encounter', 'Warner', 'surprised', 'learn', 'gotten', 'engaged', 'very', 'preppy', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'student', 'Vivian', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'Vivian', ""n't"", 'like', 'Elle', 'tries', 'make', 'Elle', 'Harvard', 'experience', 'as', 'miserable', 'possible', 'hopes', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'school', ""n't"", 'right', 'Also', 'Elle', 'usually', 'unprepared', 'classes', 'also', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'miserable', 'experiences', 'Warner', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'notice', 'Meanwhile', 'Elle', 'upset', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'manicure', 'done', 'woman', 'who', 'manicure', 'woman', 'lonely', 'depressed', 'getting', 'divorce', 'husband', 'not', 'getting', 'fair', 'share', 'property', 'custody', 'So', 'Elle', 'tries', 'help', 'woman', 'get', 'back', 'what', 'hers', 'husband', 'Also', 'going', 'woman', 'Elle', 'man', 'back', 'then', 'must', 'work', 'hard', 'get', 'so', 'Elle', 'become', 'serious', 'work', 'surprised', 'find', 'actually', 'improving', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'professors', 'Professor', 'Callahan', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'few', 'other', 'students', 'including', 'Warner', 'Vivian', 'help', 'assignment', 'assignment', 'out', 'be', 'murder', 'case', 'accused', 'former', 'president', 'soroity', 'house', 'Elle', 'used', 'live', 'old', 'college', 'Elle', 'girl', 'innocent', 'crime', 'one', 'team', 'will', 'believe', 'So', 'Elle', 'determinded', 'solve', 'puzzle', 'case', 'get', 'friend', 'jail', 'time', 'maybe', 'starting', 'lose', 'interest', 'Warner', 'guy', 'come', 'life', 'Emmett', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'who', 'assisting', 'Callahan', 'trial.OVERALL', 'THOUGHTS', 'personally', 'loved', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'acting', 'superb', 'entire', 'cast', 'especially', 'Reese', 'ultimately', 'shines', 'script', 'clever', 'humorous', 'not', 'offensive', 'dark', 'am', 'Boston', 'native', 'have', 'true', 'appreciation', 'film', ""'m"", 'always', 'seeing', 'preppy', 'Harvard', 'students', 'whenever', 'visit', 'Harvard', 'Square', 'lol', 'directing', 'awesome', 'just', 'fun', 'film', 'can', 'enjoy', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'blonde-haired', 'very', 'girlie', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'away', 'DVD', 'also', 'nicely', 'packaged', 'bonus', 'inlcude', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'introductions', 'exclusive', 'featurettes', 'Hoku', 'music', 'video', 'audio', 'commentary', 'trivia', 'track.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Legally', 'Blonde', '.Score:100/100A+']",Legally Blonde

Among the supporting players, Matthew Davis strikes a nice balance between weasel and nice guy, and Jennifer Coolidge is very funny as Elle's manicurist friend(and used to much better effect here than in the insipid AMERICAN PIE).  Also funny is Alana Ubach as one of Elle's old school chums(she delivers several funny one-liners, including a brief, but hilarious, dialogue with an Asian manicurist--spoken in the manicurist's native tongue, no less). As Davis' new fiancee, Selma Blair, that most nondescript of actresses, continues her seemingly endless string of playing one-dimensional, one-note characters(though she's not bad, she has yet to find a role that distinguishes her as anyone with some talent).

671553,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00005O5CM,Craig MACKINNON,"[0, 2]","At first glance, this film would appear to be a rehash of &quot;Clueless&quot; - especially when comparing the equally blonde, likable, and rich characters played by Alicia Silverstone (Clueless) and Reese Witherspoon (Legally Blonde).  However, after 30 minutes, you start to realise that Legally Blonde is actually a fish-out-of-water story.  Elle (Reese's character) is a fashion major and sorority girl from a (fictional) west-coast university who decides to go to Harvard Law School (in pursuit of her boyfriend).  She barely makes it in (a scene that contains the film's funniest moment: &quot;Don't we encourage diversity in our program?&quot;), and shows up in Massachusetts dressed in hot pink with her chihuahua in tow.  In hearty contrast are her classmates - serious law students toting Masters degrees and dressed in beige and grey.  The story is basically how Elle buckles down, learns to work hard, and wins the approval of her peers and professors while remaining true to herself.The movie only works because of Wotherspoon's protrayal - Elle is completely likeable, even when she starts off as a spoiled rich girl.  The movie doesn't dwell on artificial crises thrown in Elle's way (in fact, the cut scenes on the DVD include a few of these, which the editor wisely eliminated).  Instead, we are drawn in by the character and are cheering for her to make it through the law degree.  In addition, to the untrained ear, the legalese is convincing, not a parrot of filibuster courtroom scenes from past movies.The DVD edition, oddly enough, may be more than most people would expect for such a film.  There are 2 audio commentaries, some short featurettes (one enumerates all of Reese's hair styles, something like 32 in total), and a pop-up video trivia track.  All are entertaining to some degree, if occasionally repetative.  Most interesting are the cut scenes, including an introduction to each (and explanation why they were cut) by the director.  All of this (including both widescreen and P&amp;S forms of the film) fits on a single disc (2-sided).Therefore, for a light-hearted, fun film, check it out.  If you are already a fan of the film, the DVD includes lots of goodies which recommends it over the VHS tape.",3,"Likeable, funny fluff; nice DVD features",1023667200,"06 10, 2002",2002,2236,"['first', 'glance', 'film', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'rehash', 'quot', 'Clueless', 'quot', 'especially', 'when', 'comparing', 'equally', 'blonde', 'likable', 'rich', 'characters', 'played', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'Clueless', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'However', '30', 'minutes', 'start', 'realise', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'actually', 'fish-out-of-water', 'story', 'Elle', 'Reese', 'character', 'fashion', 'major', 'sorority', 'girl', 'fictional', 'west-coast', 'university', 'who', 'go', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'pursuit', 'boyfriend', 'barely', 'scene', 'film', 'funniest', 'moment', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'encourage', 'diversity', 'program', 'quot', 'up', 'Massachusetts', 'dressed', 'hot', 'pink', 'chihuahua', 'tow', 'hearty', 'contrast', 'are', 'classmates', 'serious', 'law', 'students', 'toting', 'Masters', 'degrees', 'dressed', 'beige', 'grey', 'story', 'basically', 'how', 'Elle', 'down', 'learns', 'work', 'hard', 'approval', 'peers', 'professors', 'remaining', 'true', 'herself.The', 'movie', 'only', 'Wotherspoon', 'protrayal', 'Elle', 'completely', 'likeable', 'even', 'when', 'off', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'girl', 'movie', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'artificial', 'crises', 'thrown', 'Elle', 'way', 'fact', 'cut', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'include', 'few', 'editor', 'wisely', 'eliminated', 'Instead', 'are', 'drawn', 'character', 'are', 'cheering', 'make', 'law', 'degree', 'addition', 'untrained', 'ear', 'legalese', 'convincing', 'not', 'parrot', 'filibuster', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'movies.The', 'DVD', 'edition', 'oddly', 'enough', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'expect', 'such', 'film', 'are', '2', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'short', 'featurettes', 'one', 'Reese', 'hair', 'styles', 'something', '32', 'total', 'pop-up', 'video', 'trivia', 'track', 'are', 'entertaining', 'degree', 'occasionally', 'repetative', 'Most', 'interesting', 'are', 'cut', 'scenes', 'including', 'introduction', 'explanation', 'why', 'were', 'cut', 'director', 'including', 'widescreen', 'P', 'amp', 'S', 'forms', 'film', 'single', 'disc', '2-sided', '.Therefore', 'light-hearted', 'fun', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'are', 'already', 'fan', 'film', 'DVD', 'lots', 'goodies', 'VHS', 'tape']",Legally Blonde

Witherspoon has a genuine radiance on screen which, combined with her wonderful sense of comedic timing, allows one to forgo analysis of the obvious and hackneyed plot and concentrate on her quite considerable talents.  Moreover, Luketic, in what amounts to a heroic restraint these days, virtually completely forgoes the modern tendency in summer ""fluff"" movies to avoid cheap and tawdry sexual exploitation (the ""bend & snap scene being the only real exception) and concentrate on the story, letting is focus on Reese's acting rather than her bosom.

671565,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B00005O5CM,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[38, 48]","As a blonde myself, I really should have been offended by this feature-length blonde joke, but hey, this flick is first-rate fluff. Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) is a self-absorbed sorority president and fashion major who expects to marry her college sweetheart Warner (Matthew Davis).  When Warner dumps her because she isn't the perfect accompaniment to his expected Harvard Law degree (too much Marilyn Monroe and not enough Jackie Kennedy), her whole world crashes around her until the solution hits her:  Why doesn't she become the woman Warner wants by following him to Harvard Law School?  To Elle, who has a specialty in The History of Polka Dots, this seems like a no-brainer, and since she doesn't seem to know how to use her brain, the hilarity begins.  She manages to get into Harvard through a brazen video, great LSAT's (for which she actually studied), and by stunning every last member of the admissions committee.Who cares about realism when you've got a clueless blonde mixing with over-achieving, nerdy law students?  The always popular Elle becomes the class outcast, with a tongue-tied, good-hearted manicurist (played memorably by Jennifer Coolidge) as her only friend.  Director Luketic deserves enormous credit for keeping Elle's core personality intact despite the intellectual transformation; the sight of her colorful iMac in the sea of charcoal gray laptops is pitch-perfect as a symbol of her increasing seriousness but unwillingness to give into the nerd culture.  In her sorority house, Elle is but one of many blondes.  At Harvard, she is an individualist.This film is completely preposterous and doesn't care - that's the fun of it.  Although the eventual triumph of Elle is predictable, how she gets there is not, making this film enjoyable every step of the way.  The script is surprisingly smart for fluff and is a huge reason for the success of this extended blonde joke.For mindless entertainment, you can't beat this film.  &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; is one of those guilty pleasures you might hate to admit having.  Remember, you can always watch it in the privacy of your own home where no one but your closest relatives can hear you laugh at the antics of Elle Woods.",4,Preposterous but Oh So Blonde,1085702400,"05 28, 2004",2004,2210,"['blonde', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'offended', 'feature-length', 'blonde', 'joke', 'hey', 'flick', 'first-rate', 'fluff', 'Elle', 'Woods', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'self-absorbed', 'sorority', 'president', 'fashion', 'major', 'who', 'marry', 'college', 'sweetheart', 'Warner', 'Matthew', 'Davis', 'When', 'Warner', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'accompaniment', 'expected', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'degree', 'too', 'much', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'not', 'enough', 'Jackie', 'Kennedy', 'whole', 'world', 'crashes', 'solution', 'Why', ""n't"", 'become', 'woman', 'Warner', 'following', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'Elle', 'who', 'specialty', 'History', 'Polka', 'Dots', 'no-brainer', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'how', 'use', 'brain', 'hilarity', 'get', 'Harvard', 'brazen', 'video', 'great', 'LSAT', 'actually', 'studied', 'stunning', 'last', 'member', 'admissions', 'committee.Who', 'realism', 'when', ""'ve"", 'got', 'clueless', 'blonde', 'mixing', 'over-achieving', 'nerdy', 'law', 'students', 'always', 'popular', 'Elle', 'class', 'outcast', 'tongue-tied', 'good-hearted', 'manicurist', 'played', 'memorably', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'only', 'friend', 'Director', 'Luketic', 'enormous', 'credit', 'keeping', 'Elle', 'core', 'personality', 'intact', 'intellectual', 'transformation', 'sight', 'colorful', 'iMac', 'sea', 'charcoal', 'gray', 'laptops', 'pitch-perfect', 'symbol', 'increasing', 'seriousness', 'unwillingness', 'give', 'nerd', 'culture', 'sorority', 'house', 'Elle', 'one', 'many', 'blondes', 'Harvard', 'individualist.This', 'film', 'completely', 'preposterous', ""n't"", 'care', 'fun', 'eventual', 'triumph', 'Elle', 'predictable', 'how', 'not', 'making', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'step', 'way', 'script', 'surprisingly', 'smart', 'fluff', 'huge', 'reason', 'success', 'extended', 'blonde', 'joke.For', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'film', 'quot', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'quot', 'one', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'might', 'hate', 'admit', 'having', 'Remember', 'can', 'always', 'watch', 'privacy', 'own', 'home', 'where', 'one', 'closest', 'relatives', 'can', 'hear', 'laugh', 'antics', 'Elle', 'Woods']",Legally Blonde
671566,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00005O5CM,Deborah Earle,"[2, 2]","Based on the novel of the same name by Amanda Brown, this 2001 comedy is about the losses and gains  experienced by a priviledged young woman from California, and her ultimate self-empowerment.Elle Woods(as played by a multi-dimensional Reese Witherspoon) is the President of her Sorority, Delta Nu. A neighbor of TV producer Aaron Spelling during her formative years, her world revolves around fashion and frivolity, although  we see signs of underlying intelligence when a sales clerk who views her as ""a dumb blonde with Daddy's plastic"" is taught a lesson.We meet the beloved Sorority Queen on the day she expects a proposal from her long-time boy friend, Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis). Instead of a marriage proposal, Warner breaks up with Elle during their evening out, explaining that his family back East expect a lot from him, and that marrying a ""Jackie"" instead of a ""Marilyn"" will be more conducive to his family's desires, if he wants to be a Senator.The spurned young woman spends the next few days behind the closed doors of her dorm room, with only her chiahuahua/favorite accessory Bruiser (Moonie) for companionship. Her stereotypically ditzy sorority sisters, Margot and Serena (Jessica Caufiell, Alanna Ubach) finally draw her out of her pink cocoon, and take her for a manicure. There is a comical moment where Serena converses in Chinese with a manicurist, which gives her a little more depth. While reading a ""Fox and Hound"" magazine in the waiting room, Elle sees a photo of Warner's brother with his fiancee, breifly discusses the fiancee's credentials with the customer sitting next to her(Natalie Barish), and decides to attend Harvard Law School to win Warner back.Elle's parents (James Read, and Tane McClure) are not very encouraging in this endeavor, nor is her advisor (Allyce Beasley) as Elle does not have the academic background for it.  Still, she passes her LSAT test, and sends and admissions video, for which it requires some suspension of disbelief to think that the pop-eyed, bow-tied Admissions Committee would deem acceptable.Elle creates quite a stir upon her arrival at Harvard, but remains fairly oblivious to comments and stares about her eccentricities in manner and dress.She finally locates Warner, who is stunned that she got into Harvard, and during a class for which she is ill-prepared, is shown up by a small, pallid, mahogony-tressed Vivian Kensington(Selma Blair), whom, to her great distress, she learns is Warner's fiancee.Along the way, she receives help and advice from Emmett Richmond (a well-cast, kind, and encouraging Luke Wilson, whose performance hits all the right notes), and a cathartic chat with manicurist Paulette Bonafonte (Jennifer Coolidge), which will be bright spots along her journey.Gradually, she overcomes rejection and humiliation by her classmates through perseverance, and attention to details others neglect, winning friends and influencing people.She helps Paulette with a legal matter, and in getting a date with a handsome UPS guy (Bruce Thomas), and the mutual friendship between the law student and manicurist is a delightful cornerstone of this film.Gradually, Vivian warms to her, and the two share a laugh about Warner's idiosyncracies.One of Elle's more intriguing classmates--the character as well as the actor himself-- is the sweet, awkward David Kidney, portrayed by Oz Perkins, with the eyes of his father, Anthony, who does great justice to his acting pedigree. Sadly, he would only have a little more than a month to enjoy the success of this film before enduring the shattering loss of his mother, Berry Berenson, in the 9-11 Disaster.Elle's opinionatedness in Professor Callahan's(Victor Garber's)class appears to earn her an internship with Callahan's law firm, and she, Warner, Vivian, David, and Enid Wexler(Meredith Scott Lynn) work on a murder case under Callahan's supervison. The task also reunites Elle with Emmett.The case is a high profile one involving  the slaying of a wealthy 60-year-old man, allegedly by  his young second wife, Brooke Taylor Windham (Ali Larter), a member of Elle's sorority, and a wealthy fitness instructor of whom Elle was once a student.Raquel Welch appears as the ex-wife of the murdered man, with a perfect upper-crust accent, Linda Cardellini is her daughter, Chutney, and Greg Serano is the pool boy, Enrique Salvatore.There are comical moments when Elle tries to coax an alibi from Brooke, bringing her a basket of beauty aids and "" the Bible"" (a copy of ""Cosmopolitan"" magazine), and later discovers evidence to discredit a witness in a way that only a Cosmo Girl can, with Emmett sneaking up on his blind side in the process.Elle suffers a major setback when she discovers the real reason Callahan wanted her as an intern, but Professor Stromwell(Holland Taylor) goads Elle into having a bit more backbone and stick-to-itiveness.Brooke fires Callahan, and hires Elle, who under Emmett's supervision, solves the case, much to her own amazement and everyone else's.Warner, whose true character has been revealed throughout the film in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, finally views Elle as a worthy marriage partner, but Elle has her own ideas about their future relationship.A glittering musical score accompanies our heroine as she walks out of the courtroom and into a very bright future, with a meaningful career and a wonderful life partner just on the horizon.",5,Unconventional Road to Self

This might be seen as a continuation of Election (1999) as a slightly dingier Reese Witherspoon graduates from ""CULA"" (sic) and goes on to Harvard Law School.  There's a kind of irony here--the real Reese Witherspoon with her drive and intelligence could actually do it.  Her character in the movie: I don't think so.  In fact, just about everything in the movie requires the maximum use of the suspension of disbelief option on the part of the audience because virtually nothing in the movie is real.Well, the dogs are real, but I think they were drugged, they seem so passive.  Witherspoon, of course, is real, but her performance was a little weary in parts, as though she is tired of playing ditzy blonde airheads and would like something more serious.  This script understandably was very difficult to turn down since it practically amounts to a vehicle for her, and her character triumphs over every obstacle and ends up with a choice of two attractive men and a fast track career.Selma Blair, whom I recall from Cruel Intentions (1999), provides fine support as the other girl.  Robert Luketic's direction while undistinguished is crisp and even witty at times and gets a lot out of a mediocre script.  However those who enjoyed Election might find the pandering to a mass audience in this one annoying.  Certainly there is no comparing the scripts.  However there are some funny bits and if you're a little, shall we say, relaxed, this might wash over you like a pleasant massage.",3,Pure schmaltz...,1012262400,"01 29, 2002",2002,1505,"['liked', 'might', 'be', 'seen', 'continuation', 'Election', '1999', 'slightly', 'dingier', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'graduates', 'CULA', 'sic', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'kind', 'irony', 'here', 'real', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'drive', 'intelligence', 'could', 'actually', 'do', 'character', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'fact', 'just', 'everything', 'movie', 'maximum', 'use', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'option', 'part', 'audience', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'movie', 'real.Well', 'dogs', 'are', 'real', 'think', 'were', 'drugged', 'seem', 'so', 'passive', 'Witherspoon', 'course', 'real', 'performance', 'was', 'little', 'weary', 'parts', 'tired', 'playing', 'ditzy', 'blonde', 'airheads', 'would', 'like', 'something', 'more', 'serious', 'script', 'understandably', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'turn', 'down', 'practically', 'vehicle', 'character', 'triumphs', 'obstacle', 'up', 'choice', 'two', 'attractive', 'men', 'fast', 'track', 'career.Selma', 'Blair', 'whom', 'recall', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', '1999', 'fine', 'support', 'other', 'girl', 'Robert', 'Luketic', 'direction', 'undistinguished', 'crisp', 'even', 'witty', 'times', 'lot', 'mediocre', 'script', 'However', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Election', 'might', 'find', 'pandering', 'mass', 'audience', 'one', 'annoying', 'Certainly', 'comparing', 'scripts', 'However', 'are', 'funny', 'bits', ""'re"", 'little', 'shall', 'say', 'relaxed', 'might', 'wash', 'like', 'pleasant', 'massage']",Legally Blonde

Litton,"[22, 25]","Poor Elle... her boyfriend has just dumped her, forcing her to relinguish her glamorous Los Angeles lifestyle to pursue a career in law at Harvard Law School. No one likes her; she feels despondent and alone... what's a girl to do? Why, get a manicure, of course!In &quot;Legally Blonde,&quot; one might expect voracious amounts of high-pitched voices, pouting, and out-of-nowhere remarks and comments that have become the constituent image for blondes everywhere. The movie includes all of these things, no doubt, but somehow manages to cast them in a witty and extremely humorous light, while also possessing a heart and soul that are easy to relate to. It's a priceless comedic gem, and gave me every reason to fall into its spell.In a performance that is easily likeable and irresistibly charming, Reese Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, who hopes to be accepted to Harvard Law School to prove to her ex-boyfriend that she's not too stupid to be a lawyer's wife. With a 4.0 grade average, a fashion major from CULA, and a video essay featuring herself and others in bikinis (a tactic made funnier by the fact that she doesn't realize the effect she will have on the all-male board at Harvard), she is accepted, and arrives intent on winning back her man.Of course, things are not all parties and homecomings, and she soon discovers that no one really cares to be around her. Former prospective fianc&eacute; Warner is now engaged to the snotty Vivian Kensington, leaving Elle's plans in the cold. With no one to turn to except for Paulette, a manicurist with low self esteem, Elle decides to take life into her own hands, and quickly learns the tricks of the trade at Harvard.This is where the movie takes on a personality much like its main character. By setting out to prove her worth as a law student, Elle shows a determination full of energy and real drive. By doing so, she becomes more than just the stereotypical blonde bombshell everyone sees her as, and in allowing her character to expand, the movie generates into something more than just an average teen comedy.The laughs are almost non-stop, filled with a sense of humor that has great taste and tact. Much of this has to do with the movie's mockery of all things blonde, while at the same time embracing them so that the humor isn't hurtful or insulting. From pinks skirts and high heels, to a fuzzy phone and a Chihuahua that she dresses in matching outfits, Elle's persona is a riotous display of the typical air-headedness given an atypical treatment through the display of her kindness.Her gentle nature and her unwillingness to give it up also gives the feel-good factor a shot in the arm of confidence. The movie covers just about every lesson you can think of, from friendship and broken hearts, to first appearances and loyalty, and takes on a moral that is good, clean fun without being overly sentimental. Take the scene in which Elle helps Paulette stand up to her ex-husband.

Elle loves him and figures the way to get him back is to prove to him that she's smart and to do that, she figures the perfect way would be to get into Harvard Law School where coincidentally her now ex-boyfriend is going.  She takes an exam and makes a video for Harvard to see.  Surprisingly, she ends up getting in.  She doesn't fit in there since her Harvard class-mates are more laid back with their clothing and attitude then Elle is.  Elle finds out that her ex-boyfriend has dumped her for a girl that he dated before her.  He even calls his new girl the pet name that he used for Elle right in front of Elle.  Still Elle is determined to win her man back.  To do that, she applies for and gets an internship with her professor's law firm.  Her ex-boyfriend and his current girlfriend are on the team too.  They help in a case of a woman accused of killing her husband.  The woman accused of murder is the person who used to teach Elle's exercise class.  Elle knows she's innocent but no one on the team thinks so.  Can Elle save her former exercise teacher and prove to her ex-boyfriend, her Harvard Law associates and herself that she's not a dumb blonde?  She had gotten straight As and was articulate.  If she had been doing poorly and was a bad speaker and then suddenly improved when she got into Harvard, it would have been less believable though a fashion major getting in Harvard Law is still a stretch.  It's a very cute movie.  It seemed like it could have even gotten a G rating.  It might have had a couple profanities but that was it.  No sex or violence.

The movie takes a seemingly implausible plot - blonde wants to keep boyfriend so she enrolls in law school - and with the charms of Reese Witherspoon, makes it a joyful and fun movie.Elle Woods (Witherspoon), blonde Calfornia girl, thinks her preppie boyfriend Warner is going to propose.  But Warner thinks he needs a serious gilfriend so he dumps Elle for the brunette and more stoic Sarah.  Determined to win Warner back, Elle decides to follow him to Harvard Law School.  Elle's admissions video is an absolute hoot.  It is nice that Witherspoon is fi8nally being noticed, after standout performances in &quot;Pleasantville&quot; and the best of movie of 1999, &quot;Election&quot;.  (Sorry &quot;American Beauty&quot;.)  The success of &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; has openned new door for her and we can expect a sequel to this and a &quot;Honey West&quot; series, as well as &quot;The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing&quot;.While in law school, Elle is not taken seriously. She shows up in class with a flowered pen and a heart-shaped note pad.  Finally, she breaks down and buys a pink I-mac.  The contrast between the bubbly blonde Elle and the dour Harvard stuffed shirts is wonderful.  Elle manages to get assigned as an assistant on a murder case (another incredible stretch of plausibility) and is able to use all the knowledge she has gained from Cosmo.  There are a couple of subplots, like Elle helping her maincurist friend find confidence and the usual sexual discrimination thing, but they are incidental to being able to watch Elle interact with all these Harvard bluebloods.  And the movie has something to say about accepting people for who they are and not prejudging them.The key, of course to the success of this movie is Reese Witherspoon.  She is a pure delight to watch.  She always has something out of this world to say and in spits of incredible odds, doesn't get down.  She gets close, when she thinks that a professor who admired her for her brains is really only interested in her looks. However, one of her professors says to her &quot;If you let one stupid (jerk) ruin your life, you're not the girl I thought you were&quot;.  That gives Elle the courage to go forward and she discovers that it was the right thing to do.&quot;Legally Blonde&quot; has been released in many cities to make up for movies that were delayed or dropped early.  In this dire times, it is the kind of movie that will make you laugh - and that is what we need.",5,Not Another Dumb Blonde,1001808000,"09 30, 2001",2001,2563,"['ever', 'movie', 'succeeded', 'back', 'star', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'description', 'movie', 'seemingly', 'implausible', 'plot', 'blonde', 'keep', 'boyfriend', 'law', 'school', 'charms', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'joyful', 'fun', 'movie.Elle', 'Woods', 'Witherspoon', 'blonde', 'Calfornia', 'girl', 'preppie', 'boyfriend', 'Warner', 'going', 'propose', 'Warner', 'serious', 'gilfriend', 'so', 'Elle', 'brunette', 'more', 'stoic', 'Sarah', 'Determined', 'win', 'Warner', 'back', 'Elle', 'follow', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'Elle', 'admissions', 'video', 'absolute', 'hoot', 'nice', 'Witherspoon', 'fi8nally', 'being', 'noticed', 'standout', 'performances', 'quot', 'Pleasantville', 'quot', 'best', 'movie', '1999', 'quot', 'Election', 'quot', 'Sorry', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'success', 'quot', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'quot', 'openned', 'new', 'door', 'can', 'expect', 'sequel', 'quot', 'Honey', 'West', 'quot', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'quot', 'Girl', 'Guide', 'Hunting', 'Fishing', 'quot', 'law', 'school', 'Elle', 'not', 'taken', 'seriously', 'up', 'class', 'flowered', 'pen', 'heart-shaped', 'note', 'pad', 'Finally', 'down', 'pink', 'I-mac', 'contrast', 'bubbly', 'blonde', 'Elle', 'dour', 'Harvard', 'stuffed', 'shirts', 'wonderful', 'Elle', 'get', 'assigned', 'assistant', 'murder', 'case', 'incredible', 'stretch', 'plausibility', 'able', 'use', 'knowledge', 'gained', 'Cosmo', 'are', 'couple', 'subplots', 'Elle', 'helping', 'maincurist', 'friend', 'find', 'confidence', 'usual', 'sexual', 'discrimination', 'thing', 'are', 'incidental', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'Elle', 'interact', 'Harvard', 'bluebloods', 'movie', 'something', 'say', 'accepting', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'prejudging', 'them.The', 'key', 'course', 'success', 'movie', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'pure', 'delight', 'watch', 'always', 'something', 'world', 'say', 'spits', 'incredible', 'odds', ""n't"", 'get', 'down', 'close', 'when', 'professor', 'who', 'admired', 'brains', 'really', 'only', 'interested', 'looks', 'However', 'one', 'professors', 'quot', 'let', 'one', 'stupid', 'jerk', 'ruin', 'life', ""'re"", 'not', 'girl', 'thought', 'were', 'quot', 'Elle', 'courage', 'go', 'forward', 'was', 'right', 'thing', 'do.', 'quot', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'quot', 'been', 'released', 'many', 'cities', 'make', 'up', 'movies', 'were', 'delayed', 'dropped', 'early', 'dire', 'times', 'kind', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'what', 'need']",Legally Blonde

One of the things that I still don't quite understand is how Amazon picks its ""Spotlight Reviews.""Sometimes those Reviews are great. But, sometimes...Okay. Here are excerpts from the current Spotlight Reviews for this film (though they may be different by the time you read this):""I was disappointed by this film. I was hoping it was going to be a satire, a la 'Clueless'. When I realized in the first 15 minutes or so that it was not, then I at least hoped it would be funny in any kind of way (e.g. dumb funny). Well, it didn't even do that.[...]"" -- First Spotlight Review""As a blonde myself, I really should have been offended by this feature-length blonde joke, but hey, this flick is first-rate fluff.[...]The script is surprisingly smart for fluff and is a huge reason for the success of this extended blonde joke. For mindless entertainment, you can't beat this film. 'Legally Blonde' is one of those guilty pleasures you might hate to admit having. Remember, you can always watch it in the privacy of your own home[...]."" -- Second Spotlight Review (from a ""Top 100 Reviewer"" no less)Uh...Maybe it's me.But I don't think that either of these two reviewers get this film. Legally Blonde is not a movie trying to make fun of blondes. What would even be the point of that? Nor is it a ""dumb comedy,"" nor is it trying to be. It is not an extended blonde joke. It is not mindless. Nor is, as the second above reviewer mentioned in her write-up, the main character (Elle) mindless.In fact, the point of the film is that she has a mind. The point is that, despite being blonde and pretty, she still has other skills and abilities (and an incredible amount of compassion and kindness) that people unfairly overlook or dismiss. This is a movie with a heart, a mind, and, my friends, a message. The message isn't devastatingly clever or anything like that, but it's a good, solid one, nonetheless. And, it appears to have been too subtle for the reviewers quoted above.Usually, this kind of movie is about a nerd or other outcast who falls in love with a beauty and gets unfairly discriminated against by the popular kids on account of his appearance, etc. This is the exact same film, except the roles are reversed. In this movie, the beautiful, pampered prima-donna is trying her darndest to fit in with the smart kids (the nerds) but is constantly rejected on the basis of the same sorts of shallow, prejudicial judgements from which they typically suffer. When she competes for an internship, everyone assumes that she won't have the brains to pull it off. When she gets that internship based on her skills, people assume that she must have slept her way to the top. Along the way, she is constantly humiliated and made fun of, on a large part based on the color of her hair and the way she dresses. We're not supposed to be laughing at her, people; we're supposed to be sympathizing with her (unless, like the cruel ""nerds"" she encounters, we're too tied up in people's looks).Whether or not you're particularly receptive to it, this movie is trying to say that we all suffer from rejection, ostracization and prejudice--even the pretty and popular.Even though the Spotlight Reviews here on Amazon might not reflect the fact, this is not a ""mindless extended blonde-joke,"" nor is it a failed Clueless; this is a story about an outsider fighting for love and struggling to fit in, and yes, she happens to be blonde and pretty and wear lots of pink.

671577,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B00005O5CM,Doug Erlandson,"[1, 1]","""Legally Blonde"" is about Elle (Reese Witherspoon), a sorority girl who, during her senior year in college, is dumped by her boyfriend, Warner Huntington III, because, according to him, she is not smart enough to be the wife of a future lawyer/senator. Elle sets out to prove him wrong. Warner has already been accepted at Harvard Law School, so Elle applies, sends a most unusual application, and is accepted. Somehow, despite some missteps along the way, Elle manages to succeed at Harvard, graduating at the top of her class, and gets placed with a top-rate firm, while Warner languishes near the bottom of his class.And that's the plot. Which means that the plot is pretty straightforward, easy to follow, and lacks subtlety. One might add that it's a bit trite. Moreover, the improbability of Elle getting accepted at Harvard Law, given her credentials (or lack thereof), is overwhelming, as is the improbability of her rising to the top of her class. So, one has to do a little suspending of disbelief to accept the story line. But, after all, this is a comedy, which, I suppose, makes this okay.However, the movie is redeemed by Reese Witherspoon. ""Legally blonde"" is one of her earlier efforts, but her talent, which has become even more evident in subsequent movies, is already on display, and, really, is enough to carry the entire movie and make it a movie that is worth watching once.

That is so far removed from the truth and I don't want possible buyers led astray.  So here's the real deal.First and formost, this is NOT a movie about a ""dumb blonde"".  This movie is about the President of fictional sorority Delta Nu, who is a fashion merchandising major with a 4.0 grade point average.  She IS smart when it comes to her field of study and all surrounding subjects.  This is proved when she goes with her friends (one of whom, as a result of hanging out in nail salons, speaks fluent Korean!!) to buy the perfect dress for what she thinks will be the night her boyfriend Warner (Mathew Davis from Pearl Harbor) proposes to her.  The sales clerk of the botique, thinking Elle must be a dumb blond, tries to pass off an old dress with a propensity to snag as a one-of-a-kind original.  Elle quickly, and sweetly, let's her know she is NOT dumb, ditzy or willing to be taken advantage of.When Warner breaks up with her because he needs a serious girl like the ""Vanderbilt"" one his brother is marrying, she is crushed.  But after noticing his soon-to-be sister in law is a law student, she has her plan; she too must attend law school!  And from there, we ride a roller coaster of Elle studying for the LSAT's, making her wonderfully inventive admissions video and doing what even Warner was not able to do...get into Harvard Law School On Her OWN Merits!Along the way, we meet Vivian, Warner's new fiancee and Elle's competition, and a whole host of others who will be for or against Elle during her quest to win Warner back.  But after a crushing blow or two, Elle soon figures out that actual studying, faith and a seriousness she HAS ALWAYS possessed, is all she needs to survive and prove, Not To Warner, but to Herself, that she Does Indeed Belong at Harvard.  She isn't GIVEN a position as helper on a sensation murder case.  She EARNS IT with her outspoken and legally on point answers in class.  And goes on to prove that Cosmo girls with intelligence and someone who believes in them, can do anything.This movie shows true intelligence, integrity and endurance wrapped up in a fluffy, child friendly ""girl power"" environment.  The fact that my 13 year old Son LOVED the movie says a great deal.  So don't believe this is another ""dumb blonde"" movie.  Reese Witherspoon has gained a fan for life in me with this triumphant trip to Harvard that far surpasses anything I've ever seen in the genre.

I still think that parts of this movie has things that only a girl could appreciate but the rest of it was pretty funny.Witherspoon stars as Elle Woods and after getting dumped by her boyfriend, she decides to get him back by the only way possible... GO TO HARVARD LAW! In doing so she finds that she's more than just a pretty face, she's a top notch defense. Along the way, she tries to win back her beau only to fund out that he got engaged to a mean uptight Selma Blair who is constantly making her stay at Harvard an uncomfortable one. In the end she puts her Law skills to the test as she finds herself in a heated Murder trial. It's up to Elle to come out on top.O.k. this is yet another comedy where you have to take it was it is. In any case, it's a funny movie and Witherspoon does reallt well in this role. A lot of people have plugged this as the new CLUELESS and I personally don't think it is because the 2 movies are completely different. The only thing the 2 share in common is that the lead is played by a beautiful, yet somewhat ditsy girl but other than that TOTALLY DIFFERENT and should not be compared to each other.Definately get this movie because it'll make you laugh.

She is one of the best young actresses around right now.  She has a great comic ability and her timing is impeccable.  She is very talented, and in my opinion, is a bit underrated as an actress.Enough about the Blonde, and on to the movie.  The main character, Elle Woods, played by Reese, has been kicked to the curb by her man because she isn't smart enough.  It takes an episdoe like this to get Elle to prove to herself that she is smart.  While she acts pretty ditzy, and graduates with a Bachelors in Fashion Design, she decides to try and get into Harvard Law School as that is where the ex boyfriend goes.  She wants to show him that she is smart enough for him.  One of the funniest parts is her &quot;video essay&quot; she sends to the school and the board of admissions is viewing it.  I laughed through this entire scene.  She is accepted.Along the way, she learns a lot about herself, and she meets some pretty funny characters.  When she goes into a nail boutique for an emergency manicure, she meets Paulette Bonafonte, played hilariously by Jennifer Coolidge.  They become fast friends.  She meets Emmett, played by the sweet and charming Luke Wilson, at the school.  He is a lawyer who is also an assistant to Elle's worst professor.  He becomes her new love interest, and Emmett is sweet to her and believes in her more than Warner ever did.  Elle is the underdog, but in the end she wins out.  This is a good rental.

Without listening to those who claimed it to be a &quot;girls movie&quot;, my husband and I went together to the movie theater to watch it. And we both loved it!Aside from being very funny, it also has a deep meaning to it. Never judge from the appearance only, things are not always what they look, actually they RARELY are what they look. And this is what Elle Woods, the main character, wants to prove. Greatly interpreted by Reese Witherspoon, Elle looks and behaves like a girl straight out of a blond joke. She sees silly and shallow at first (but extremely funny!), but then you change your mind quickly when you see how she reacts to her boyfriend dumping her because she doesn't fit into his plan of becoming senator, she's too pretty, too perfect, wears too much pink, and she's too... blond. You start really liking Elle when she gets admitted to Harvard, and start being a real fan of hers when she shows how she can gain respect for being smart and a good student even when still wearing flashy designer clothes.This movie shows you that a woman has many resources and that being good-looking and caring about one's appearance doesn't mean one doesn't care about anything else.

From the opening scenes of mega-eye-candy, showing the important things in the world of the sorority, this could have easily turned into yet another vulgar teen comedy and quickly forgotten.  If not for the clever writing of the Elle Woods character, and the casting of Reese Whitherspoon, this could have easily went down this path.What I liked very much is that it's easy to think early on that Elle is exactly the ditz she seems to be.  Her world is shallow, and full of fluff, and she works hard at maintaining the status quo.  Had she become engaged to her boyfriend as she planned to at the start of the story, she might have stayed in this world.But what we start seeing of her is that she's a very smart person.  She has excelled in her chosen field of fashion merchandising, because that's all that was ever expected of her.  While her original reasons for trying to make more of herself are, well, ditzy, we start seeing a person capable of accomplishing a lot without compromising a lot of what is important to her.This would still not make it a really good movie if it wasn't for one more characteristic.  The Elle character is a genuinely good person.  While being on the receiving end of a lot of abuse for her lifestyle, she dishes out almost none on her own.  This is a genuinely nice person who you root for to win in the end.The only problem I had was the lightweight legal material.  I saw exactly where the movie was going when Elle questions the daughter about a perm, and I'm sorry, but witnesses don't fall down and confess so easily.

671596,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005O5CM,"""flickjunkie""","[6, 8]","""Legally Blonde"" is a showcase for Reese Witherspoon that continues to highlight her talents.  The film draws comparisons with ""Clueless"" since the theme is essentially identical.  Elle (Witherspoon) progresses from a culturally challenged blonde bubblehead to a high achieving Harvard law student for all the wrong reasons.  All the while she has to endure mockery for her valley girl attitudes. Of course, she triumphs over east coast bigotry and over own limitations, but for all the wrong reasons.The story is cute, but lacks the insight and nuance of ""Clueless"".  However, Witherspoon outdoes Alicia Silverstone's performance with her sheer energy and determination.  Both were excellent, but Witherspoon is the more dynamic.The acting by the ensemble of supporting actors is very good and helps Witherspoon look that much better.  The cast is rich in aspiring actors with strong talent and little name recognition.  Of particular note are the performances of Selma Blair and Luke Wilson.  Blair plays the uppity girlfriend of Elle's former boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis).  Blair is wonderfully condescending and catty throughout most of the film, but shows the ability to move into a softer, more likeable portrayal by the end.  Wilson's soft spoken demeanor is perfect for his nurturing role in this film.  His support is the catalyst that makes Elle's transition work.Reese Witherspoon has been gradually moving to progressively larger parts for the last ten years, and at age 25 she made the leap to the lead with this film.  She definitely makes the most of the opportunity.  She simply dominates the entire film with a high energy performance that has as much steel as perfume.  She makes Elle as lovable as she is ridiculous, while instilling her with qualities that you can't help but admire as the film progresses.  If this is representative of the wattage she will bring to films, then her future is likely to be very bright.This is not a great film, but it is very charming and watchable.  I rated it a 7/10.

She's appeared in several critically acclaimed films such as Cruel Intentions, Election, and Pleasantville.  And with Legally Blonde, her hot streak continues.Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, the beautiful, blonde, rich valley girl who gets dumped by her boyfriend who has made the decision to become more &quot;serious&quot; and study at Law School.  After being rejected,, Elle decides to follow him to Law School to win him back.  When she gets there, she realizes he has a new girlfriend, who is played by Selma Blair (Reese's co-star in Cruel Intentions).  This sets up an amazingly fresh and bright comedy that is sure to be remembered by many people.Elle quickly becomes a very likeable character.  She stands up for what she believes in and says some of the things that we wish we could to others, but don't.  She's very much of an outcast when she arrives at Harvard and despised by most, but as the movie continues, she slowly begins winning over almost every character in the movie.Legally Blonde is a very bright and smart comedy, with a hip and talented cast.  It contains great morals, a great story, and fun dialogue.  And when it's over, no matter what mood you were in before, you're guaranteed to feel better about yourself afterwards.  This movie is definitely worth a look.There are many great extras contained on the DVD, such as a Hoku music video, deleted scenes, and two featurettes.

Reese Witherspoon delivers a powerhouse performance as Elle Woods, a ditzy yet lovable blonde who has, for her entire life, never been regarded as the ""serious"" type. Nobody has ever seen her that way, and that has never bothered Elle before, but it really gets to her when her cocky boyfriend Warner dumps her for that very reason and heads off to Harvard Law School. Thinking that she might still have a chance of winning back Warner's heart,  Elle also decides to enroll. Her remarkable imput on things gradually brings her to the head of her class, but throughout most of the movie, love is the one thing she's after. In an attempt to find a ""serious"" girlfriend, Vivian is Warner's top choice. This girl is serious, all right, and she's Elle's biggest competition. While working on her studies and striving to get Warner back, Elle helps her insecure manicurist find love and works on an important trial case which profiles Brooke Taylor--Elle's biggest fan--suspected guilty of murder. With her evident charm and intelligence, Elle proves herself worthy of being taken seriously, and by the time the movie is over, all you can do is admire her for everything she's done.

On one hand, it was exactly what I expected.  On the other hand, it was a pretty good movie.Reese Witherspoon is Elle Woods, a senior in college who lives a life of privilege.  She is the pampered girl who was homecoming queen and was involved in all of the stereotypical activities.  She is the social queen, but nobody expects much out of her intellectually (though she pierces that bubble when talking about the fashion and the minutia regarding the industry).  She expects her boyfriend to propose to her, but instead he dumps her saying that he needs someone serious in his life if he expects to be in the Senate by age 30.  She is crushed and decides to follow him to law school and enroll herself (and show that she is a serious person).  She is actually accepted to Harvard Law School on the strength of her test scores and Harvard's desire to diversify a little (she really did qualify, though).At first, Elle is treated like a joke but her determination wins through and she gains friends and respect.  In a way, that's what this movie is.  I thought it was going to be a joke and completely fluffy, but Reese (and the movie) tries so hard and is so likeable that I couldn't help but enjoy the movie.

As he puts it, ""I need to marry a Jackie (Kennedy), not a Marilyn (Monroe)."" Stunned, Elle soon comes to the conclusion that to win him back, she also must get into Harvard Law. Since she has a Fashion Design major, her prospects seem dim. But this is, after all, a Hollywood fable and not real life. The all-male admissions committee grants her entry after viewing her application video, which shows her bikinied in a hot tub. Even lawyers can go ""oink, oink"".

Reese Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, a Beverly Hills blonde with a fashion designing career in order and a Hawaiin Tropic belt under her . . . belt. When her boyfriend (Matther Davis) decides to dump her and go to Harvard to pursue a career in Law, Elle figures the only way to win him back and to show him up at his own game. So Elle heads off to Harvard, and certainly does show a lot of people that blonde is a whole lot more fun than people put on.Legally Blonde came as a surprise hit to Hollywood. But it's totally worthy of it's praise. The screenplay is smooth going and never hits a corny note, even with some of the characters that could have been ultra corny. Reese Witherspoon absolutely shines as Elle Woods. Jennifer Coolidge was adorable as Elle's new best friend, Paulette. Matthew Davis played the part of the rich, snobby boy to the core, and Selma Blair's change in character was flawless. She's too cute. The rest of the supporting cast all gave great performances, as well as the little Chihuahua who played Bruiser.The Special Edition dvd is a must-have for your collection. There are two audio commentaries with film crew and Reese Witherspoon. Two features, one which goes into full detail on the movie; from the beginning of the idea to the end result. I was glad to see this instead of a 7 minute or so promotional spot which is marked as a featurette. This part of the DVD is a much watch. The other featurette is all about Reese's hair and is a fun little ditty. There are 8 or so deleted scenes, some with commentary from director Robert Luketic.

671643,AU2V2ZKMZFNY6,B00005O5CM,"JR Corry ""Jenny""","[2, 7]","No matter how much or little you've heard of this film, you should by now be aware of one thing: its main point is, or seems to be, proving that blondes aren't stupid. Am I the only one who believes it didn't do as good a job proving that point as it could have? I happen to be a blonde and I think I'm a reasonably intelligent one, thank you. However, I do not a) love shopping b) know every shoe type or c) adore pink. And yet, this movie seems determined to prove that those three things are what all blondes do. Excuse me if I don't find that flattering or hilarious. I appreciate clever comedies as much as the next person, but if someone expected me to either lavishly praise this movie or say something along the lines of, ""Oh, this movie's SUCH a credit to blondes everywhere!"", it ain't gonna happen. As cute and clever as it sometimes was, this movie failed to impress me on any particular level.Brief summary: Elle is a very clever young woman who actually decides to choose law school over lounging in a pool all year at her parent's mansion. Before you get too impressed, though, Elle mainly did this to win back her boyfriend, not because she'd always dreamed of being a lawyer (then again, maybe that's a point in her favor). In spite of her partially shallow motives, however, she excells in law school, blows away many of her classmates, and proves to have far more brains than many gave her credit for. The story does very well by portraying not only Elle's clever and sometimes hilarious tactics, but her own personal struggle as she tries to fit in with the other students and recover from her boyfriend's cruel treatment. However, its pitfalls come from painfully goofy moments, even more painfully stupid characters, and, occasionally, the same message that it seems to attempt to disprove: that blondes aren't automatically dumb.While Elle's definitely smart, she is also occasionally an undeniable bimbo. She still dedicates too much time to her looks, dresses in hot pink almost 24/7 (including a sexy-bunny costume to a party and a frilly dress to a TRIAL), and dresses up her lapdog (gag). If the film really wanted to prove that Elle was smart, it could have done without the blondes-are-bimbos stereotype too and given Elle a little more common sense. Two examples: when her first client (a woman suspected of killing her husband) tells Elle that her only alibi to the murder was getting a lipo-suction and she simply can't bear to reveal this to the public, Elle, rather than reminding her that a prison sentence is worse than losing what's left of her reputation, says ""Your secret is safe with me"" in a sickeningly reassuring tone. (Your Honor, I'd like to take this moment to point out that Elle's client was blonde too, so her rather stupid reason to not reveal her alibi, and Elle's even dumber understanding of it came off to me as two blondes sharing a ""blonde moment"", which rather contradicted the movie's whole point, don't you think?)Another example was when Elle, hearing two strange girls cruelly reject a boy who asked one of them out, walked up to the boy and loudly asked him why he didn't call her after giving her the best sex of her life. She then stalked off, leaving the two mean girls far more interested in him than they were a few moments ago. My question: why did she bother trying to impress the two witches when she could have just told them off? Much of the story supports the idea that you should credit people for their inner character, so WHY did Elle try to uplift the guy in his crush's eyes after the way she treated him? I was left very disappointed in Elle and furious at the scene's shallow message.My main peeve with the film, other than the fact that it seemed to say that even smart blondes can't help being fashionably obsessed and fluffy-brained, was that Elle was surrounded by people ten times dumber and shallower than any human has the right to be. Take Elle's client, who she seemed to be so fond of; with her shallow attraction to her pool man (which she almost proudly admitted to in her own trial), her marriage to a guy twice her age, and the fact that she was willing to risk going to prison rather than revealing the fact that she had lipo-suction, I rather hoped she'd be convicted; her extreme shallowness and utter lack of common sense was so infuriating, she almost completely undid any good that Elle gave to the ""blonde community"" in the movie. Elle's mother was also tide-pool deep and was shocked that Elle would want to go to law school when she could just laze around in her money. And Elle's friends...well, let's just say that if any person that dumb existed in the real world, they couldn't survive on their own. And yet, people praise the movie for its cleverness. Yes, it's definitely clever in some points, but it also suffers from the extreme annoyance that some of its dumber-than-dirt characters exude. Some good messages, some cute moments, but nothing truly deep or real. Fluffy entertainement with some substance, but don't expect a Harvard degree behind the scriptwriting.",3,Does this movie really prove that blondes aren't stupid?,1158537600,"09 18,

It begins with a light and lively isn't-it-great-to-be-young introduction, complete with plenty of the colorful materialism typical of yuppie films to dazzle the viewer and convince them they can actually buy this fantasy life for themselves.

Miss Witherspoon as Elle Woods is absolutely charming; personality plus and a warm heart.

As a fan of the &quot;girliness is powerful&quot; film genre, I definitely enjoyed _Legally Blonde_.As lots of reviewers have said, what keeps _Legally Blonde_ is Reese Witherspoon's wonderfully ingenuous performance as the apparently vacuous blonde who turns out to be the smartest person at Harvard Law, as well as the nicest, kindest and definitely the pinkest.  She's wonderful, and the film has enough energy and girl-affirming moments to mostly smoothe you over a few doubts.The doubts include the fact that the film itself isn't nearly as nice as its lead character.  Gays could give this film a miss if they're tired of being portrayed, and ridiculed, as mincing queens, and while the angry lesbian character is eventually softened, she spends most of the film being a different sort of cliche.  And some of the film's apparent satirical targets (Westie air-head culture, Eastie uptight sorority culture, the expectation that an engagement ring is the highest possible thing a girl can aim for, to name three) turn out to be affirmed, not undermined, by the movie's end.  And the semi-serious end, where our heroine makes the graduation keynote speech (in praise of diversity) is crying out to be leavened by a joke, and it isn't: it's meant to be taken seriously.  We don't need that sort of TV movie ending; we need More Comedy, dammit!And then I notice that the jokes are often a bit small, and a bit too far apart.  When you're watching a comedy, mostly enjoying it, but you notice that the first gag to come along in a while has been a shot of the heroine's dog wearing a comical costume ... When the dog gets the best lines, or at least sight gags, you start to feel that the scriptwriters haven't worked quite as hard on this film as they should have.But I'm over-analysing, sure.  Reese Witherspoon's bright-eyed performance as a blonde who is never as dumb as she lets herself appear is a joy.  It's got a great soundtrack of California girl-rock, important tips about perm maintenance and the importance of keeping up with this year's shoes...  And it flies along having fun.  The script's nowhere near as good as girl-movie classics like _Clueless_ or even _Michelle and Romy's High School Reunion_, but _Legally Blonde_ has a star who is a phenomenon, and it has enough energy to persuade you to drop your critical faculties for 85 sugar-candied minutes.The best girl-movie of the Millenium!  Well, as at October 2001, and counting...

Like Alicia Silverstone in Clueless, Reese carries the film.  She is so confident and charismatic in her performance as a seemingly dumb blonde (a sharpie in blonde's clothing) that the film is worth a rent.Other positives:  great soundtrack of girl songs, terrific DVD features about the making of the movie and the outtakes - there are a huge amount of extras here.What makes it not &quot;buyable&quot;?  The rest of the cast is forgettable, unlike Clueless, which featured great support for Silverstone, Reese is forced to carry the movie.  Both love interests are unworthy of her and there is little or no chemistry, there are no breakout character actresses in the ranks of other students in the sorority or in law school.  The familiar actor playing the high powered law school professor, Callahan, changes so quickly into a lounge lizard, it will make your head spin.  The actress who plays Paulette, the manicurist that Elle befriends, is not believable in the role.  Exceptions?  A great chihuahua, and the fabulous Holland Taylor as the woman law school professor....In an effort to transform a California girl into a Harvard Law student, the filmmakers go too far into the &quot;Barbie syndrome&quot;...fashions and accessories are too girlie and just too adolescent to be believable.  A great illustration - while Elle is getting ready for her &quot;engagement dinner&quot; (which turns out to be where she gets dumped) she tries on a knockout dress in turquoise.  Unbelievably, she appears ready for dinner in a cheap red and black number, instead.A nice flick for chicks where the misunderstood heroine gets more than just the man she adores, she shows the world she is a person of quality, without giving up the girlish touches that make her unique.  Witherspoon proves she can carry a comedy, but her film presence is so strong, we all hope it will translate into meatier roles in the future, and not just give her the opportunity to host Saturday Night Live.",4,"Rent, don't buy...",1005955200,"11 17, 2001",2001,2070,"['Reese', 'Witherspoon', '5', 'star', 'performance', 'quot', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'quot', 'DVD', 'rentable', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'Clueless', 'Reese', 'film', 'so', 'confident', 'charismatic', 'performance', 'seemingly', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'sharpie', 'blonde', 'clothing', 'film', 'rent.Other', 'positives', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'girl', 'songs', 'terrific', 'DVD', 'features', 'making', 'movie', 'outtakes', 'are', 'huge', 'amount', 'extras', 'not', 'quot', 'buyable', 'quot', 'rest', 'cast', 'forgettable', 'Clueless', 'featured', 'great', 'support', 'Silverstone', 'Reese', 'forced', 'carry', 'movie', 'love', 'interests', 'are', 'unworthy', 'little', 'chemistry', 'are', 'breakout', 'character', 'actresses', 'ranks', 'other', 'students', 'sorority', 'law', 'school', 'familiar', 'actor', 'playing', 'high', 'powered', 'law', 'school', 'professor', 'Callahan', 'changes', 'so', 'quickly', 'lounge', 'lizard', 'will', 'make', 'head', 'spin', 'actress', 'who', 'Paulette', 'manicurist', 'Elle', 'befriends', 'not', 'believable', 'role', 'Exceptions', 'great', 'chihuahua', 'fabulous', 'Holland', 'Taylor', 'woman', 'law', 'school', 'professor', 'effort', 'transform', 'California', 'girl', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'student', 'filmmakers', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'quot', 'Barbie', 'syndrome', 'quot', 'fashions', 'accessories', 'are', 'too', 'girlie', 'just', 'too', 'adolescent', 'be', 'believable', 'great', 'illustration', 'Elle', 'getting', 'ready', 'quot', 'dinner', 'quot', 'out', 'be', 'where', 'dumped', 'knockout', 'dress', 'turquoise', 'Unbelievably', 'ready', 'dinner', 'cheap', 'red', 'black', 'number', 'instead.A', 'nice', 'flick', 'chicks', 'where', 'misunderstood', 'heroine', 'more', 'just', 'man', 'world', 'person', 'quality', 'giving', 'up', 'girlish', 'touches', 'make', 'unique', 'Witherspoon', 'can', 'carry', 'comedy', 'film', 'presence', 'so', 'strong', 'hope', 'will', 'translate', 'meatier', 'roles', 'future', 'not', 'just', 'give', 'opportunity', 'host', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live']",Legally Blonde

Convinced that this was true love, she struggles to find a way to win Warner back.  In an effort to be perceived as serious, she follows him to Harvard Law School.  She soon finds that the work is much harder then she anticipated.  And Warner is already engaged to someone else.  Will she managed to fit in, or will she drop out and move back to California?As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a fairly formulaic comedy.  The first time I watched it, the plot only surprised me a couple of times.  However, it's so much fun, I really don't care.  Reese Witherspoon really caries the movie was Elle and brings such warmth to the part that it's easy to root for her to overcome her circumstances.  The other actors really shine as well, and several sub-plots help keep things interesting.  I find myself laughing and cheering my way through the movie.This is a first rate DVD.  The picture and sound have been well preserved.  The audio commentaries are a mixed bag, some interesting information mixed in with a &quot;You were wonderful&quot; love fest.

With her case-closed smile and innocent baby blues, Witherspoon as a sorority princess who makes the grade in the Ivy League, lifts what could have been a trial into the realm of inspired fluff. Elle is smarter than she looks (a lesson the film belabors) and has the good sense to hire a Coppola to direct her admissions video.First-time director Robert Luketic's heavy hand with sitcom farce strains credulity and patience. But the script, by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (Ten Things I Hate About You), gets off a few zingers, and Witherspoon - though miles from the keen satire of Election - stays one sharp cookie even as the film's plausibility crumbles. The silly and predictabl plot moves along at a trip hammer speed, however, and it is all played for laughs. Of course it is Witherspoon's performance that makes the film so much better than it should be. Her on-screen prescene is electrifying and her smile can melt just about anyone.

Fantasy is what it is, and that's ALL that it is. There are definitely some funny scenes and it's diverting. The idea that it presents a good message for girls about working to achieve goals and being true to yourself, though . . . I have to warn you, girls in our daughter's high school were saying they wanted to be lawyers because this movie made a legal career seem fun and glamorous and exciting. Our daughter told them, ""Are you crazy? My parents are lawyers. I KNOW better."" I suppose at some sad level, being inspired to attend law school by Elle Woods is no more naive than being inspired to attend law school by Atticus Finch, but at least Atticus Finch lost his big case. Don't be fooled. Even if you enjoy the intellectual challenge and have pleasant colleagues and are lucky enough to handle an occasional case that affects public policy or helps someone with a problem, law is mostly a lot of hard work under mountains of paper with cases dragging on for months or years and ending in settlements where justice is neither entirely served nor entirely undermined. That's assuming you don't do family law which is truly from hell. Unless you're at the very top of the food chain, it's not even all that remunerative. The lawyers who make the most money usually represent the most unsavory clients. Lawyers have very high rates of depression and substance abuse compared to the general population. And nobody wears hot pink suits with stilettos and accessory dogs to court.

671678,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005O5CM,Matthew Horner,"[11, 15]","Legally Blonde is a comedy that pokes fun at the lifestyles of rich California girls. A few years ago, a little jewel of a movie called Clueless gave us a much funnier and more insightful look at these young ladies. It's probably still around your video store. The immensely talented and likable Reese Witherspoon stars in Legally Blonde. She portrayed a much more determined and funnier girl in Election, one of the best teen comedies ever made. This doesn't mean Legally Blonde isn't enjoyable. It means it's lightweight entertainment. It makes you smile a lot rather than laugh. It does have the distinction of being rather sweet and lovable [thanks to Ms. Witherspoon] in a year of mainly cynical and gross-out comedies.Elle Woods [Witherspoon] has it all. She's rich, adorable and popular. So is her boyfriend, Warner [Matthew Davis]. Her sorority sisters at her Los Angeles college think Warner is about to propose marriage. Everyone is ecstatic. Instead, Warner, who is about to go to Harvard Law School, dumps her. He says she doesn't fit into his plan to be a US Senator by the time he is thirty because, frankly, she's just too blonde. He needs a girl who's more East Coast Establishment, like a Kennedy or a Rockefeller. In real life, a young woman would be thankful to have seen her boyfriend's true colors before it was too late. But this is the movies, so Elle decides she will become the girl he desires. She applies to Harvard herself, and actually gets accepted. Off she goes to Cambridge with her little dog, Bruiser, and a Bekins truckload of furniture and fashion accessories. There, she discovers she's still too blonde for Warner, who now has a brunette girlfriend. That's okay. She a Southern California girl, and nothing is too big of a challenge for one of those. Her optimism and sense of self are too great to be undone by much of anything or anyone.Legally Blonde plays like an old-fashioned star vehicle. The entire movie revolves around Ms. Witherspoon to the point where the other actors have little to do except play second banana to her. While she certainly is an interesting enough actress to be the center of attention, I suspect the situation arose because of weaknesses in the script. There are other very talented players here, in particular Holland Taylor, Jennifer Coolidge and Ali Lartner, but their characters either aren't well developed or are too little seen. This type of satirical comedy works best when the lead has at least one strong character to work off of. One of the elements that made Election work so funny was that Witherspoon's ruthless character had a powerful adversary in that of Matthew Broderick's.One of the movie's strongest assets is its costumes. Witherspoon has over fifty costume changes. These range from the outlandish to the bizarre to the fabulous. At the points where the movie dragged a bit, I was kept alert by wondering what on earth the star would appear in next. All this attention to clothing is appropriate because the focal point of Legally Blonde isn't about the legal profession. It's about what's fashionable. The emphasis here is definitely on blonde rather than legal.",3,"Fun, but don't expect a great satire",1017705600,"04 2, 2002",2002,3155,"['Legally', 'Blonde', 'comedy', 'fun', 'lifestyles', 'rich', 'California', 'girls', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'little', 'jewel', 'movie', 'called', 'Clueless', 'gave', 'much', 'funnier', 'more', 'insightful', 'look', 'young', 'ladies', 'probably', 'still', 'video', 'store', 'immensely', 'talented', 'likable', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'stars', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'portrayed', 'much', 'more', 'determined', 'funnier', 'girl', 'Election', 'one', 'best', 'teen', 'comedies', 'ever', 'made', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Legally', 'Blonde', ""n't"", 'enjoyable', 'lightweight', 'entertainment', 'smile', 'lot', 'rather', 'laugh', 'have', 'distinction', 'being', 'rather', 'sweet', 'lovable', '[', 'thanks', 'Ms.', 'Witherspoon', ']', 'year', 'mainly', 'cynical', 'gross-out', 'comedies.Elle', 'Woods', '[', 'Witherspoon', ']', 'rich', 'adorable', 'popular', 'boyfriend', 'Warner', '[', 'Matthew', 'Davis', ']', 'sorority', 'sisters', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'college', 'think', 'Warner', 'propose', 'marriage', 'Everyone', 'ecstatic', 'Instead', 'Warner', 'who', 'go', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', ""n't"", 'fit', 'plan', 'be', 'US', 'Senator', 'time', 'thirty', 'frankly', 'just', 'too', 'blonde', 'girl', 'who', 'more', 'East', 'Coast', 'Establishment', 'Kennedy', 'Rockefeller', 'real', 'life', 'young', 'woman', 'would', 'be', 'thankful', 'have', 'seen', 'boyfriend', 'true', 'colors', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'movies', 'so', 'Elle', 'will', 'become', 'girl', 'Harvard', 'actually', 'accepted', 'Cambridge', 'little', 'dog', 'Bruiser', 'Bekins', 'truckload', 'furniture', 'fashion', 'accessories', 'still', 'too', 'blonde', 'Warner', 'who', 'now', 'brunette', 'girlfriend', 'okay', 'Southern', 'California', 'girl', 'nothing', 'too', 'big', 'challenge', 'one', 'optimism', 'sense', 'self', 'are', 'too', 'great', 'be', 'undone', 'much', 'anything', 'anyone.Legally', 'Blonde', 'plays', 'old-fashioned', 'star', 'vehicle', 'entire', 'movie', 'Ms.', 'Witherspoon', 'point', 'where', 'other', 'actors', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'play', 'second', 'banana', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'enough', 'actress', 'be', 'center', 'attention', 'suspect', 'situation', 'arose', 'weaknesses', 'script', 'are', 'other', 'very', 'talented', 'players', 'here', 'particular', 'Holland', 'Taylor', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'Ali', 'Lartner', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'well', 'developed', 'are', 'too', 'little', 'seen', 'type', 'satirical', 'comedy', 'works', 'best', 'when', 'lead', 'least', 'one', 'strong', 'character', 'work', 'off', 'One', 'elements', 'made', 'Election', 'work', 'so', 'funny', 'was', 'Witherspoon', 'ruthless', 'character', 'had', 'powerful', 'adversary', 'Matthew', ""Broderick's.One"", 'movie', 'strongest', 'assets', 'costumes', 'Witherspoon', 'over', 'fifty', 'costume', 'changes', 'range', 'outlandish', 'bizarre', 'fabulous', 'points', 'where', 'movie', 'dragged', 'bit', 'was', 'kept', 'alert', 'wondering', 'what', 'earth', 'star', 'would', 'appear', 'next', 'attention', 'clothing', 'appropriate', 'focal', 'point', 'Legally', 'Blonde', ""n't"", 'legal', 'profession', 'what', 'fashionable', 'emphasis', 'here', 'definitely', 'blonde', 'rather', 'legal']",Legally Blonde

The film actually made its theatrical release during the time of the year when box offices tend to slack - after summer and before Thanksgiving-Christmas push.  Anyway, the point made is that I'm so darn wrong about this film.  The first impression is not always right.  Legally Blonde is fun, inspring but not over-done.Elle (Reese Witherspoon), a graduating fashion marketing major from CULA, had next tried hard for anything in her life.  Her well-to-do parents provide.  She is home-coming queen and the head of the sorority house she stayed in.  She is fashion savy and deeply in love with her boyfriend, Warner Huntington III.  Expecting Warner to propose to her on a very romantic date, her boyfriend instead decided to break up with her and leave for Harvard Law School because Elle was not serious and scholarly (well, hmmm...because blonde is usually flashy and flaunty) enough to be his girlfriend and that in order to be a future senator, Warner demanded a woman of more political charisma.  Her life collapsed and her dream shattered.  Brokenhearted and shattered, Elle realized that her only chance of getting Warner back was to pursue his interest and apply for Harvard Law.The first part of the film is quite predictable in its plot.  What I really come to like about the film is the portrayal of Elle's character.  It is inspiring to see her transform through the film.  It also surprises many that though a fashion savy, Elle is not some stupid air headed bimbo as her appearance suggests her to be.  Elle is likable, amiable, heart-warming, and good-hearted.  The part where she befriends with the manucurist and helps her get the dog back really touches me.  I'm sure that the audience must have felt for her and wanted to see her succeed among her colleagues in school and win the approval of the Harvard elite.  Elle worked hard and exceled in her schoolwork.  Later on when she worked as an intern on defending a murder case, she was confused and frustrated about how people didn't take her seriously.  The result of that is maturing of her character.  Elle herself taught us how our first impression is not always right.  I don't want to give away too much of the story just so to ruin your viewing pleasure.  But Legally Blonde is a warm comedy that is worth seeing.",4,First Impression Is Not Always Right,1015027200,"03 2, 2002",2002,2384,"['friend', 'lent', 'DVD', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'absolutely', 'had', 'expectation', 'film', 'film', 'actually', 'made', 'theatrical', 'release', 'time', 'year', 'when', 'box', 'offices', 'tend', 'slack', 'summer', 'Thanksgiving-Christmas', 'push', 'Anyway', 'point', 'made', ""'m"", 'so', 'darn', 'wrong', 'film', 'first', 'impression', 'not', 'always', 'right', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'fun', 'inspring', 'not', 'over-done.Elle', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'graduating', 'fashion', 'marketing', 'major', 'CULA', 'had', 'next', 'tried', 'hard', 'anything', 'life', 'well-to-do', 'parents', 'provide', 'home-coming', 'queen', 'head', 'sorority', 'house', 'stayed', 'fashion', 'savy', 'deeply', 'love', 'boyfriend', 'Warner', 'Huntington', 'III', 'Expecting', 'Warner', 'propose', 'very', 'romantic', 'date', 'boyfriend', 'instead', 'decided', 'break', 'up', 'leave', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'Elle', 'was', 'not', 'serious', 'scholarly', 'well', 'hmmm', 'blonde', 'usually', 'flashy', 'flaunty', 'enough', 'be', 'girlfriend', 'order', 'be', 'future', 'senator', 'Warner', 'demanded', 'woman', 'more', 'political', 'charisma', 'life', 'collapsed', 'dream', 'shattered', 'Brokenhearted', 'shattered', 'Elle', 'realized', 'only', 'chance', 'getting', 'Warner', 'back', 'was', 'pursue', 'interest', 'apply', 'Harvard', 'Law.The', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'quite', 'predictable', 'plot', 'What', 'really', 'come', 'like', 'film', 'portrayal', 'Elle', 'character', 'inspiring', 'see', 'transform', 'film', 'also', 'many', 'fashion', 'savy', 'Elle', 'not', 'stupid', 'air', 'headed', 'bimbo', 'appearance', 'be', 'Elle', 'likable', 'amiable', 'heart-warming', 'good-hearted', 'part', 'where', 'manucurist', 'get', 'dog', 'back', 'really', ""'m"", 'sure', 'audience', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'wanted', 'see', 'succeed', 'colleagues', 'school', 'win', 'approval', 'Harvard', 'elite', 'Elle', 'worked', 'hard', 'exceled', 'schoolwork', 'Later', 'when', 'worked', 'intern', 'defending', 'murder', 'case', 'was', 'confused', 'frustrated', 'how', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'result', 'maturing', 'character', 'Elle', 'taught', 'how', 'first', 'impression', 'not', 'always', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'just', 'so', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'warm', 'comedy', 'worth', 'seeing']",Legally Blonde

My faves out of the cast have to be Ali Larter and Stifler's Mom! They stole the movie out from underneath Reese Witherspoon.What is amazing about this movie, is the sheer amount of time spent on Reese's hair (which looks suspiciously like extensions). Throughout the movie, she has a mere 40 different hairstyles, which sometimes feels like a different hairstyle for each scene of the movie. Reese also wears a lot of different clothes for each scene, a lot of them with something pink in them, which she all got to KEEP after this was finished shooting! Free clothes, alright for some!Once again, Selma Blair comes across as a bit of an ice queen in her role as Vivian, but you'll be glad to hear, the ice melts before the end of the movie!What didn't I see coming in this movie? What Victor Garber's character really turns out to be. And trust me, he's not as nice in this, as he was in Titanic.There is a sequel too, which I'm sure I'll manage to get my hands on eventually.

The film stars the very talented Reese Witherspoon (known also for her role in the 1998 film &quot;Pleasantville&quot;) as sorority-queen Elle Woods, who majored in college in fashion merchandising.  The film begins with Elle being dumped by her boyfriend Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis), who plans to attend the prestigious Harvard Law School.  Determined to be with Warner, Elle decides to take the L.S.A.T. so that she can apply to Harvard Law School herself.  After studying harder than she has ever done in her life, Elle passes the L.S.A.T. and films an introductory video of herself to send with her application to Harvard Law School.  The Admissions Committee at Harvard Law School approves and Elle begins her journey into a new life at Harvard.  Elle's vivacious, naive, sorority-party attitude doesn't exactly fit the typical Harvard Law School student.  However, after Elle meets Warner's snobbish fianc&eacute;e, Vivian Kensington (Selma Blair), she is befriended by a poorly educated manicurist, Paulette Bonafont&eacute; (Jennifer Coolidge), who inspires Elle to become a more serious law student.The film takes some unexpected turns as Elle is propelled into world of jurisprudence and the court of law.  Memorable scenes in the film include Elle's first law school class with Professor Stromwell (Holland Taylor), Elle's revealing costume, Elle explaining the dynamics of the &quot;bend and snap&quot; to Paulette, and Elle explaining perm maintenance in a courtroom.  Other wonderful characters include Emmett (Luke Wilson), Professor Callahan (Victor Garber), Brooke Taylor Windham (Ali Larter), the UPS Guy (Bruce Wilson), Enrique (Greg Serano), Chutney Windham (Linda Cardellini) and a brief appearance by Raquel Welch as Mrs. Windham Vandermark.&quot;Legally Blonde&quot; is an engaging and endearing comedy whose success resulted not only from a great story, but also the talents of Reese Witherspoon for making a fashion merchandising major turned law student plausible.  Overall, I rate &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; with a much-deserved 5 out of 5 stars.  I hope that its sequel to be released in July 2003 (&quot;Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde&quot;. also starring Reese Witherspoon) will be equally as funny and further demonstrate Elle Woods' passion for the study and practice of law.",5,&quot;The 'bend and snap' works every time!&quot;,1047600000,"03 14, 2003",2003,2402,"['quot', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'quot', 'was', 'one', 'funniest', 'films', 'released', '2001', 'film', 'very', 'talented', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'known', 'also', 'role', '1998', 'film', 'quot', 'Pleasantville', 'quot', 'sorority-queen', 'Elle', 'Woods', 'who', 'majored', 'college', 'fashion', 'merchandising', 'film', 'Elle', 'being', 'dumped', 'boyfriend', 'Warner', 'Huntington', 'III', 'Matthew', 'Davis', 'who', 'attend', 'prestigious', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'Determined', 'be', 'Warner', 'Elle', 'take', 'L.S.A.T', 'can', 'apply', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'studying', 'harder', 'ever', 'done', 'life', 'Elle', 'L.S.A.T', 'films', 'introductory', 'video', 'herself', 'send', 'application', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'Admissions', 'Committee', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'approves', 'Elle', 'journey', 'new', 'life', 'Harvard', 'Elle', 'vivacious', 'naive', 'sorority-party', 'attitude', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'fit', 'typical', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'student', 'However', 'Elle', 'meets', 'Warner', 'snobbish', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Vivian', 'Kensington', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'befriended', 'poorly', 'educated', 'manicurist', 'Paulette', 'Bonafont', 'eacute', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'who', 'Elle', 'become', 'more', 'serious', 'law', 'student.The', 'film', 'unexpected', 'turns', 'Elle', 'propelled', 'world', 'jurisprudence', 'court', 'law', 'Memorable', 'scenes', 'film', 'include', 'Elle', 'first', 'law', 'school', 'class', 'Professor', 'Stromwell', 'Holland', 'Taylor', 'Elle', 'revealing', 'costume', 'Elle', 'explaining', 'dynamics', 'quot', 'bend', 'snap', 'quot', 'Paulette', 'Elle', 'explaining', 'perm', 'maintenance', 'courtroom', 'Other', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'include', 'Emmett', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Professor', 'Callahan', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'Brooke', 'Taylor', 'Windham', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'UPS', 'Guy', 'Bruce', 'Wilson', 'Enrique', 'Greg', 'Serano', 'Chutney', 'Windham', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'Mrs.', 'Windham', 'Vandermark.', 'quot', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'quot', 'engaging', 'endearing', 'comedy', 'success', 'resulted', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'story', 'also', 'talents', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'making', 'fashion', 'merchandising', 'major', 'turned', 'law', 'student', 'plausible', 'Overall', 'rate', 'quot', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'quot', 'much-deserved', '5', '5', 'stars', 'hope', 'sequel', 'be', 'released', 'July', '2003', 'quot', 'Legally', 'Blonde', '2', 'Red', 'White', 'Blonde', 'quot', 'also', 'starring', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'will', 'be', 'equally', 'funny', 'further', 'demonstrate', 'Elle', 'Woods', 'passion', 'study', 'practice', 'law']",Legally Blonde

Fowler ""ben1283""","[0, 0]","'Legally Blonde' surpassed everyone's expectations last year when it became one of the most successful movies of last summer, even in blockbuster season.  The story has Elle Woods (Witherspoon) as the blonde sorority girl who is dumped by her boyfriend because she's not smart enough for him.  Determined to prove him wrong she enrolls in Harvard Law School, whereupon she finds he's now engaged to Selma Blair.  But she's prepared to steal him back as well as ace her degree.Okay, so the plot is a bunch of fluff that's as empty-headed as the sorority types it tries so desperately to lampoon but with Witherspoon on board it's impossible not to root for her.  It's pretty near impossible to read a review that doesn't make at least one reference to the comic genius that was Witherspoon in the biting satire 'Election', and such comic timing is on full display here.  Brimming with sexual attitude, naivity and an endearing determination Witherspoon fleshes out the role of Elle admirably.  Even with the clich&eacute;d story (you can tell right from the get-go who Elle will end up with) she keeps you watching right up until the very end.Still, I don't mean to write off the rest of the people involved in the movie completely because there are plenty of good ideas and observations here.  The fact that the clique of sorority girls are, at Harvard, the underdog is a nice reversal of roles that works incredibly well.  Still, you do suspect that without Witherspoon on board this would be just another teen movie.

All together, the film is pretty damn good, especially if you want to relax and watch a real Girl Power movie!Reese Witherspoon makes a fantastic Elle Woods. I can't imagine anyone who would play the part better. Personally, I think she is one of the most talented actresses in Hollywood, with her acting range impressive and each character played with prescision and individuality. Just look at her portrayal of Elle Woods, a bubbly homecoming queen, delta nu and Bel Air socialite in comparison to her acting in, say, The Importance of Being Earnest or Cruel Intentions. She is an inspirational actress, and it is not due to her capability that I am not giving this film the full five.Okay, the film is absolutly hillarious and I adore Jennifer Coolidge as Paulette Bonafonte. They make such a great duo, and you can see them feeding off each other as the film progresses. I cherised the idea of Elle as the mentor to older Paulette, showing her the way of life she should have and helping her to regain herself - it showed the depth of Elle's character (in a less obvious way than her law school success)and her desire to pass on her 'knowledge' to those who need it.However, there are things about the film that I felt jarred me a little bit:1#  I feel that maybe Raquel Welch could have been more convincing in the part of Chutney's mother, Mrs. Windham Vandermark. She was okay, but I wasn't quite convinced.2#  I don't know why, but something about the female Law teacher in the Salon... you know that scene? Something about it didn't quite fit.Other than that, there's really not many points I can pick with the film. So it's predictable, obviously 'staged' at times and over the top, but hey! That's all the fun, isn't it? It is a great film, not an absolute masterpeice, but it will definatly always remain a part of my collection.Oh, but unless you already have, don't bother watching the sequal.

You will always feel good after watching it.Instead of being the typical rich, snotty, elitish sorrority queen, Reese Witherspoon' s Elle Woods is warm, endearing, funny (especially when she cries during the breakup scene with Warner; her hilarious crying is reminscent of Doris Day's in ""Pillow Talk""), and intelligent.For once the tables are turned and the popular sorrority girl finds herself an outcast with Harvard's staid law school students and professors. But with pluck, determination, and a positive outlook, Elle forges on and eventually wins them over.The scene where Elle introduces herself to some classmates during Orientation is priceless. After she utters the classic line, ""Whoever thought orange was the new pink is seriously disturbed,"" the reaction from her classmates is absolutely hysterical. I laugh everytime I see it.The only REALLY dippy-dumb part was the ""Bend And Snap"" portion. That was really LAME, and really did not fit into the film all that well. To me, that temporarily transformed Elle back into the mindless, air-headed blonde.  It just didn't fly.Other than that portion, this is a cute, fun film.

I was thinking that ""Legally Blonde"" was just another title for ""Clueless 2"" and I wondered where Alicia Silverstone would fit in.  Still, I thought it looked saccharine, sweet, Bubblicious, and fun....and fun it is.The plot revolves around Reese Witherspoon's character, Elle Woods, a blonde, beauty queen, perfect, Barbie doll, babe.  But not only does Elle look perfect, but she acts perfectly too....I'll get more into that aspect of her character later.  Anyway, Elle's perfect GQ boyfriend Warner, is about to go off to Harvard Law and instead of proposing to her he dumps her.  He tells Elle that if he wants to be a senator by the time he's 30 (uh, good luck) he needs a more serious girl-- a Jackie, not a Marilyn-- as he so aptly puts it.  Elle is just not serious enough for him.  Unfortunately, Elle is seriously in love with Warner and doesn't want to lose him.  She devises a plan to get him back-- she'll go to Harvard Law too (""What, like it's hard?"", she says).The rest of the story involves how Elle deals with the nerds at Harvard, the attitudes of East Coasters, and scary sadistic law professors.  As if all that is not enough....Elle also has to cope with Warner's horrible, mean, super [nasty] fianc&eacute; who makes it a point to humiliate Elle whenever possible.  She's a real meany!  Elle pulls through and eventually realizes that she really is a smart girl with a great legal mind (in her own way)....oh, not to mention a great sense of style and knowledge about fashion.Overall, the story is really cute and very enjoyable.  There was only one scene that really made me roll my eyes and think, ""D'oh!  Gimme a break!"".  The main reason I really liked ""Legally Blonde"" was because of Elle's character.  She's beautiful and perfect and looks like a Malibu Barbie....but she is also very self assured and confident.  She doesn't try to change herself for others and she stays true to herself despite ridicule.

671718,A3BDW1GRR19H5S,B00005O5CM,Peter J. Lusby,"[2, 2]","I rented this video expecting a cute, mindless piece of fluff for a relaxing evening's entertainment. What I got was so much more than I bargained for. True, many of the plot twists are pure far-fetched fantasy, but the basic premise was solid, and worked a charm. The primary conflict of the story line was certainly original - New England conservatism vs Left Coast consumerism is not a motif we find every decade, much less every day, in a film of any genre, and certainly not in a comedy of this nature. The gradual maturing of a group of college graduates from widely different backgrounds, as they pursue their dreams and goals at Harvard Law School could have been an excuse for a morass of schtick and slapstick. Instead, it was a sensitive, if amusing coming of age for all the protagonists, including, in the end analysis, some of the older characters.The acting was above average; it takes enormous skill to play a rle like Elle Woods - intelligent, determined and resourceful while appearing a stereotypical blonde bimbo - and play it convincingly. And if some (most, actually!) of the serendipities of the plot were less than convincing, some great acting and quite exceptional dialog made up for the poor underpinnings. I'm not a great fan of Reese Witherspoon, but certainly appreciate the panache with which she pulled this one off. There were also some sterling supporting performances, notably by Selma Blair as the rival, who gradually evolves from a horsey country-clubber into a stunning beauty as the film progresses (with appropriate character development from a snooty bitch to a warm friend).I was particularly impressed by some of the photography in this production. Pay close attention to the shadows in the poolside scene with the Woods family at the beginning of the film! Later, the private interview between Elle and Professor Callahan shows just how much can be conveyed in a handful of seconds of outstanding camera work. And the elevator scene immediately following gets my vote as one of the finest pieces of cinema photography of 2001.There aren't many films that I would consider worth watching more than once, and even fewer that I have liked enough to want to own them.

Legally Blonde is about a California sorority girl named Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) who is going to do what she has to do to win back her man after he dumped her. Her ex-boyfriend Warner Huntington III has got excepted to Harvard Law School and Elle knows she needs to do what she has to do to get excepted so she can be there to win him back. Once Elle arrives on campus she realizes it's not going to be as easy as she thought as Warner has a new girlfriend.

It is in the tradition of such movies like Never Been Kissed, and Miss Congeniality which are just plain fun entertainment which is what these  kinds of movies are meant to do entertain. I would also like to say Reese Witherspoon is one of the most talented actors today, and without her this movie would have not worked as well as it did.

I had always thought that it would be just another chick flick, dumb plot with stupid jokes. Nevertheless, I really wanted to try it out so when I did, I had a pleasantly fun surprise!Sorority girl of Delta New, Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon), has it all. She's beautiful, everyone loves her, and she has the love of her life, Warner Huntington the 3rd (Matthew Davis). But on the night she believes he's going to propose to her, he instead dumps her big time! After being told she's not serious enough to be his wife if he's going to become a senator, she comes to a decision; to show him how serious she is, she'll go to Harvard Law School where she'll be near Warner! But when she does, she discovers he is already engaged to another student, Vivian Kensington (Selma Blair). With the help of a manicurist, Paulette (Jennifer Coolidge), and support from the handsome Emmet Richmond (Luke Wilson) Elle decides to prove how smart she can be. Will Elle have enough heart to believe in herself to show the world the real person inside of her? Also starring Victor Garber as Professor Callahan and Ali Larter as Brooke Taylor who is being put on trial for murder.""Legally Blonde"" is not your usual chick flick, one of the reasons being that it falls in the category of a pure comedy since there really is not much romance is a way. The plot is as cute and as feel good as it gets, with an outcome you already guessed. But who cares since ""Legally Blonde"" ultimately satisfies you just the way it is!Reese Witherspoon is terrific for her role as the cute and peppy girl, Elle Woods. She's incredibly funny and is very much into her role as the way she walks stylishly, swishes her hair, and 'like' talks the way which makes her so believable as a sorority girl. Her character is given some character development but not too much making it too much of a change. In the end she's still Elle, fun and lovable yet a much smarter girl. The supporting cast is also superb and it's hard not to mention all of them. I especially loved Luke Wilson, my first time to see him act though I've seen his brother Owen Wilson in many movies (""Behind Enemy Lines"", ""Shanghai Noon"", ""Meet the Parents""). Though Luke Wilson doesn't have that much screen time as I'd hoped, in every role his character Emmett is such a support to Elle. Matthew Davis is also good as the 'jerk' ex-boyfriends of Elle's. I mean from the very beginning you can't help but despise him in a way though he may seem like Elle's 'Prince Charming'.As I have already mentioned, ""Legally Blonde"" is just so funny, filled with one-liners and very funny moments! There are plenty of favorite parts, some of mine including Elle's 'bend and snap' method, Elle's two friends coming to the court house saying, ""How cute! There's a judge and the jury people!"", Emmett giving tips on the professors, and lots more! Plus Bruiser, Elle's chihuahua is so adorable as she has as many different outfits as his master! Oh, and a bit of trivia, Reese Witherspoon's character wears 40 different hairstyles throughout the film!

After seeing the movie, I knew I had to add this movie to my collection. This is a great movie starring Reese Witherspoon, Selma Blair, Luke Wilson, Matthew Davis, etc.Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) has a good life going for her, being President of her sorority, a Hawaiian Tropic girl, and a natural blonde. She is in love with a fraternity boy , Warner ( Matthew Davis ) whom she wants to marry, but who dumps her simply because she is ""too blonde"". Heartbroken but angry enough, Elle decides that she will get Warner whatever it takes, even if it means joining Harvard Law School, where Warner is studying. She joins Harvard, but has a lot of twists in store for her, and must battle through them :)From my point of view, this is not just another ""teen"" movie, but it actually gives a good moral that you should never judge a person just because of his/her looks, race etc. whatsoever.

671733,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005O5CM,Reviewer,"[8, 12]","Don't judge a book by it's cover.  An old saying we've all heard so many times it doesn't seem to mean anything anymore.  But it does mean something, and it's important; and, before we proceed, go back and read it again.  In fact, let me help you:  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  There.  Now take a moment to think, really think about it.  And if it still doesn't mean anything, take a couple of hours and check out ""Legally Blonde,"" a comedy with some real teeth in it, directed by Robert Luketic and starring Reese Witherspoon.  The premise of the story has to do with upscale sorority girl Elle Woods (Witherspoon), who instead of getting the long awaited, much anticipated marriage proposal from her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), finds herself jilted as he prepares to leave for Harvard Law School.  Elle, it seems, just doesn't fit the oh-so-serious, somber profile that the wife of a future Senator must have.  It's all about image, and Elle's own 4.0 grade average earned in her ""frivolous"" curriculum apparently doesn't carry any weight.  Being outgoing, positive, beautiful AND intelligent just won't do among the ""serious"" of the ""upper crust"" elite.  So, because she looks good and enjoys her life, Elle is given the gate, and she just can't understand why.  She's devastated.  But she's also smart.  Smart enough to pick herself up and make a decision that stands them all on their ears.  With the grades and the wherewithal to swing it, she enters Harvard Law herself, initially with the intent of winning back Warner.  But along the way she  learns something important-- about the way things really are, about people and about herself, as well.  And she sets out to prove that if there is any ""shallowness"" around, it's only in the minds of those who perceive her as something and someone other than what she really is.  And, for the viewer, right out of the gate this is someone you want to see succeed in her quest, because her triumph-- whatever it may be or however it comes out-- is going to be one you share right along with her.Make no mistake, this is one funny movie-- in fact, it's downright hilarious at times.  But beyond the laughter it evokes, there's a flip side to the same coin.  Because beyond all of the comedy there is some serious issues at the heart of this film, and anyone who's ever been subjected to trials and tribulations simply because they didn't happen to fit a certain ""mold,"" or coincide with someone else's ""opinions"" of the way things should be, will be able to identify with Elle's situation.  And it's something you have to be aware of, because even while you're laughing at the funny stuff, at the same time it's almost painful to watch Elle endure the senseless, heartless, unnecessary and unwarranted acts that are perpetrated upon her.  At the core of the matter is not only the need for tolerance and understanding, but the necessity and importance of keeping an open mind about everything that transpires around you.  Who knows what monumental contributions an individual is capable of making in this imperfect machinery we call society if they are prejudged into oblivion?  So there's a lot more to this film than meets the eye; ""dumb blonde"" jokes get nipped in the bud, and by using a comedy format, the filmmakers here have produced a film that is not only entertaining, but thoroughly thought-provoking, as well.Reese Witherspoon opens herself up and gives a dynamic performance here as Elle; she conveys such a full-of-life spirit that it is easy to empathize with her, and when the hurt comes, you feel it with her.  And through it all, the way she takes it on the chin then moves on with her life makes her a role model for those who may find themselves in a similar situation.  On one hand, when Elle finds solace by getting a manicure at the local beauty shop, it makes for a falling-on-the-floor moment of hilarity, and yet you're always aware of that other side of the coin, as well.  And it makes you root for her all the more.  Witherspoon has a perky, vibrant screen presence that makes her perfect for this part, and she makes Elle a flawed and therefore very real person.  When she gets knocked down, you feel for her; and then there's that feeling of triumph when she gets back up and stands her ground.  There's no question that this is Witherspoon's movie, and it's one of the best performances of her career.The supporting cast includes Luke Wilson (Emmett), Selma Blair (Vivian), Victor Garber (Professor Callahan), Jennifer Coolidge (Paulette), Holland Taylor (Professor Stromwell), Ali Larter (Brooke Taylor-Windham), Jessica Cauffiel (Margot), Linda Cardellini (Chutney), Alanna Ubach (Serena) and Oz Perkins (Dorky David), with a special appearance by Raquel Welch as Mrs. Windham-Vandermark.  An entertaining, accessible film that should be embraced by a wide audience because of the clever way in which it gets across it's message, ""Legally Blonde"" can be enjoyed by just taking it at face value and soaking up the jokes, but offers even greater rewards to those who really delve into it and see it as an examination of human nature.  Not always, but occasionally, a movie is so much more than what it appears to be on the surface, and this is one of them.  What makes it so good is the fact that it can really make you laugh, while at the same time it's subtly telling you that there is no place for cruelty within the realm of human relationships.  It's a film that's worth seeing many times over, and that's the magic of the movies.",4,A Triumph for Reese Witherspoon,1005436800,"11 11, 2001",2001,5529,"['Do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'cover',

Holly ""piper909""","[6, 7]","I suspect one's gut reaction to ""Legally Blonde"" may hinge upon two things: fondness (or lack thereof) for Reese Witherspoon and her frothy LA sorority girl character, to whom this film entirely belongs; and  any personal experience with college and/or law school that allows the predictable script to seem funnier or more believeable than it is.The plot is a variation of the fish-out-of-water theme and offers few surprises but some mild laughs. Witherspoon creates a very credible proto-bimbette, and her dynamic expressions and careful timing wring the most out of every line and reaction. But there isn't anything very challenging about the film's message of ""Just be yourself"" as a key to success and happiness -- all fine and good when you have money, beauty, and privilege, as Witherspoon's ""Elle Woods"" does.  What Elle is forced to discover in the course of her Harvard Law School adventure is that she has a brain as well, and this along with one massively convenient plot twist after another allows Miss Woods to conquer all by film's end (which is  itself the most outrageously convenient and smiley-faced section of the movie).I'll be generous and grant three stars to ""Legally Blonde"" because it is occasionally clever and has a good heart (like our chirpy heroine) and because Witherspoon is a genuine comedic talent -- comparisons being made to a young Goldie Hawn are, if anything, understated, with Reese showing a much wider range at a far younger age.  She is going to have a long and fantastic career, no doubt about it.  But this movie is unchallenging and ultimately as filling as a big hank of cotton candy.  Nothing wrong with that, but it's no solid meal.  And sad to say, in real life, sororities and fraternities are not nearly as egalitarian, supportive,  or sweet-natured as depicted in this fantasyland, and the Elle Woods who reside within them are more likely to be  intolerant, smug, and elitist jerks and bullies -- just like the villains of this picture, not the good guys.

671740,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,B00005O5CM,Robert J. Schneider,"[4, 5]","Of course this film's plot is preposterous, but LEGALLY BLONDE (2001) is so much fun that you just sit back and go with the flow. Reese Witherspoon completes her long-in-the-making climb up to superstardom with her infectious portrayal of pink-loving, Valley Girl-talking, beauty-minded, hopelessly optomistic, quintessential blonde Elle Woods. Before this role, Reese had co-starred in a string of successful films---PLEASANTVILLE (1998), CRUEL INTENTIONS and ELECTION (both 1999)---but with LEGALLY BLONDE, she has cemented her place in film history. As with Arnold Schwarzenegger The Terminator, Macauley Culkin the Home Alone Kid, Reese Witherspoon will forever be the Legally Blonde Chick.  This is not a bad thing, because Reese is such a talented actress that I do not believe that she will succumb to being typecast. Plus, it sure didn't hurt that she received a whopping $15 million paycheck for LEGALLY BLONDE 2!In this first installment, Elle Woods is a bubblelicious Delta Nu sorority queen and soon-to-be-graduating senior at UCLA looking forward to having her blueblood boyfriend Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis) propose to her at the beginning. But instead he dumps her for being &quot;too blonde&quot; for him and his high political aspirations. He's going to Harvard Law School; she decides to study hard for the LSATs so that she can follow him to Harvard, show him that she *is* serious, and hopefully win him back. But, alas, once she makes it she learns that he's quickly moved on to another snooty blueblood Vivian Kensington (a well-cast Selma Blair). Of course, she eventually finds a mate of her own, the tall, dark and sensitive Emmett Richmond (Luke Wilson) and with his help, finds her place at Harvard Law, finds herself as an improbably brilliant legal mind, and ends up realizing that Warner's not the guy for her after all. The End. :)Of course, it's not all quite as simple as that. Along the way, she makes good friends with her hairdresser Paulette (Jennifer Coolidge) who has self-esteem (read: men) issues. She even improbably bonds and makes friends with her ex's girlfriend Vivian, who apparently has a sense of humor lurking underneath her b*tch exterior. And the real kicker is that she is asked to work on a criminal case being fought by Professor Callahan (Victor Garber), and ends up winning it for him! (Again, in an improbable but most entertaining way.)Obviously, LEGALLY BLONDE is a chick-flick fantasy and should not be taken as anything else. The reason why it's good is the same reason why *any* good comedy works: it's funny! The screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz is smart and aware, apparently adapted from Amanda Brown's novel of the same name (didn't know that till recently).  The director, a previously unknown Aussie director named Robert Luketic (who now has scored a second hit with 2004's WIN A DATE WITH TAD HAMILTON!), keeps the pace upbeat. Of course, it helps that he has a good character to work with. Elle Woods is a cross between Cher from CLUELESS (1995) and Pollyanna from the 1960 film of the same name; she has such a glowing positiveness that is so infectious it rubs off on everybody. Even when she's crying over her lost boyfriend, she doesn't stay down for long. Even when she delivers a great comeback put-down line to her main female tormentor, she delivers it with such sunniness that she manages to stay on the high road. Everybody, including her detractors, comes out better for having known her.

About ten years ago I saw on cable a delightful movie about a young girl learning about love called THE MAN IN THE MOON. The young (14 years old) actress in the main role just sparkled, and although I didn't remember her name, I remembered the movie. Last summer, I was looking through my video store, saw the cover for the movie, and thought I would double check the name of the actress, to see if she had gone on to any sort of success. I was delighted and shocked to see that the movie had starred Reese Witherspoon.As much as I have enjoyed her in PLEASANTVILLE and ELECTION, I absolutely didn't expect that she would be able to carry a film to the degree that she did this one. She did more than carry the film: she made a bad film good. And that is a rare achievement indeed. I really do think that Reese Witherspoon's best films are ahead of her.

In this case Elle Woods (Reese) helps her painfully bashful trailer trash manicurist Paulette Belafonte (Jennifer Coolidge) find love with the brutally handsome UPS guy. Its little stuff like this that infuses some heart into the picture that leaves you with a little more affection for the story after you leave the theater.

671746,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005O5CM,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","In ""Legally Blonde,"" - which could well be re-titled ""Clueless Goes to Harvard""  - the delightful Reese Witherspoon stars as a ditzy, fashion-obsessed airhead who winds up (through plot complications too elaborate to go through) taking that Ivy League law school by storm.  Needless to say, there is not a single believable moment in the film, but that is generally the case with most fish-out-of-water scenarios anyway.  What ""Legally Blonde"" does have is a warm spirit, a bubbly demeanor and a breezy charm that reflect to a tee the personality of its main character.Although the film does not exhibit the same level of comic genius we found in ""Clueless,"" Witherspoon's letter-perfect rendition of the bubblehead stereotype earns the film a great deal of audience goodwill, a factor that helps us to get over some of the movie's flatter moments.  For indeed, throughout the course of this tale, we do hit a number of arid stretches where we feel that we should be laughing an awful lot more than we are.  In fact, ""Legally Blonde"" occasionally feels more like a concept in search of a movie than a full-fledged work in its own right.  But, just as you are about to give up on it, the filmmakers hit upon a hilarious concept, sight gag or line of dialogue, which help to set the movie back on track.Clearly, Witherspoon is the big selling point of this film.  As an actress, she exudes such an air of intelligence, confidence and compassionate goodwill that she invests even her dumb blonde character with those seemingly paradoxical traits.  ""Legally Blonde"" isn't always at the top of its form, but Witherspoon wins the case for the film hands down anyway.",3,Clueless Goes to Harvard,1009584000,"12 29, 2001",2001,1660,"['Legally', 'Blonde', 'could', 'well', 'be', 're-titled', 'Clueless', 'Goes', 'Harvard', 'delightful', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'stars', 'ditzy', 'fashion-obsessed', 'airhead', 'who', 'up', 'plot', 'complications', 'too', 'elaborate', 'go', 'taking', 'Ivy', 'League', 'law', 'school', 'storm', 'Needless', 'say', 'not', 'single', 'believable', 'moment', 'film', 'generally', 'case', 'most', 'fish-out-of-water', 'scenarios', 'anyway', 'What', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'have', 'warm', 'spirit', 'bubbly', 'demeanor', 'breezy', 'charm', 'reflect', 'tee', 'personality', 'main', 'film', 'not', 'exhibit', 'same', 'level', 'comic', 'genius', 'found', 'Clueless', 'Witherspoon', 'letter-perfect', 'rendition', 'bubblehead', 'stereotype', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'audience', 'goodwill', 'factor', 'get', 'movie', 'flatter', 'moments', 'indeed', 'course', 'tale', 'do', 'hit', 'number', 'arid', 'stretches', 'where', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'laughing', 'awful', 'lot', 'more', 'are', 'fact', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'occasionally', 'more', 'concept', 'search', 'movie', 'full-fledged', 'work', 'own', 'right', 'just', 'are', 'give', 'up', 'filmmakers', 'hit', 'hilarious', 'concept', 'sight', 'gag', 'line', 'dialogue', 'help', 'set', 'movie', 'back', 'track.Clearly', 'Witherspoon', 'big', 'selling', 'point', 'film', 'actress', 'such', 'air', 'intelligence', 'confidence', 'compassionate', 'goodwill', 'even', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'character', 'seemingly', 'paradoxical', 'traits', 'Legally', 'Blonde', ""n't"", 'always', 'top', 'form', 'Witherspoon', 'case', 'film', 'down', 'anyway']",Legally Blonde

With her daddy's plastic, a bottomless wardrobe and a college career based on ""Fashion History"" Elle is something of a Barbie Doll come to cruel life.  Getting into Harvard Law School, and having a promising future ahead of him, Warner sees himself as a future JFK, and JFK isn't supposed to choose Marilyn over Jackie O.  Convinced that she still has a chance, Elle pulls out all the stops and manages to crack into the freshman class at school where she sticks out like a sore (and poorly accessorized thumb).  Making no friends, and confirming every dumb blonde stereotype ever conceived, Elle is ruthlessly victimized by her seemingly smarter and insecure classmates.  Elle wouldn't make it past her first day if not for her inexplicable capacity to dig out the common sense buried under the heady legal theory.  Instead, she sort of prospers becoming a success story and more mature person while still being the same cute Elle that only Reese Witherspoon can create.It's a thin plot, and the tacked criminal trial added at the end seems an excuse to keep a lame idea going, but it works because, like Elle, the script has an endless reservoir of pluck and manages some cute tricks of its own.  The dim homilies guiding Elle's sorority lifestyle are bound by a fierce sense of loyalty (people who exercise can't kill people - the endorphins make them too happy), one that the script remains true to.  In the end, Elle wins her case because of her loyalty to an accused killer and former sorority sister, one that you'd never think twice about doubting.  Neither seem to deserve the attention or loyalty, but manage to win the case anyway.  See it if only for Reese Witherspoon.",4,fun despite the weak idea,1013126400,"02 8, 2002",2002,1880,"['Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Elle', 'Woods', 'blonde', 'beautiful', 'slightly', 'ditzy', 'college', 'senior', 'life', 'turned', 'upside-down', 'when', 'rich', 'boyfriend', 'Warner', 'Kensington', 'Third', 'Matt', 'Davis', 'daddy', 'plastic', 'bottomless', 'wardrobe', 'college', 'career', 'based', 'Fashion', 'History', 'Elle', 'something', 'Barbie', 'Doll', 'come', 'cruel', 'life', 'Getting', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'having', 'promising', 'future', 'ahead', 'Warner', 'future', 'JFK', 'JFK', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'choose', 'Marilyn', 'Jackie', 'O', 'Convinced', 'still', 'chance', 'Elle', 'out', 'stops', 'manages', 'crack', 'freshman', 'class', 'school', 'where', 'out', 'sore', 'poorly', 'accessorized', 'thumb', 'Making', 'friends', 'confirming', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'stereotype', 'ever', 'conceived', 'Elle', 'ruthlessly', 'victimized', 'seemingly', 'smarter', 'insecure', 'classmates', 'Elle', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'first', 'day', 'not', 'inexplicable', 'capacity', 'dig', 'out', 'common', 'sense', 'buried', 'heady', 'legal', 'theory', 'Instead', 'sort', 'prospers', 'becoming', 'success', 'story', 'more', 'mature', 'person', 'still', 'being', 'same', 'cute', 'Elle', 'only', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'can', 'create.It', 'thin', 'plot', 'tacked', 'criminal', 'trial', 'added', 'end', 'excuse', 'keep', 'lame', 'idea', 'going', 'because', 'Elle', 'script', 'endless', 'reservoir', 'pluck', 'cute', 'tricks', 'own', 'dim', 'homilies', 'guiding', 'Elle', 'sorority', 'lifestyle', 'are', 'bound', 'fierce', 'sense', 'loyalty', 'people', 'who', 'exercise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'kill', 'people', 'endorphins', 'make', 'too', 'happy', 'one', 'script', 'true', 'end', 'Elle', 'case', 'loyalty', 'accused', 'killer', 'former', 'sorority', 'sister', 'one', ""'d"", 'never', 'think', 'twice', 'doubting', 'seem', 'deserve', 'attention', 'loyalty', 'manage', 'win', 'case', 'anyway', 'See', 'only', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon']",Legally Blonde

After vigorous work to get into Harvard Law, she gets in and things take a turn for the worst.Actress Reese Witherspoon basically makes the movie what it is.

Little did I know that 96 minutes later I'd like her even more. Legally Blonde is one of those movies that people like to hate without seeing. They dismiss it because they think they know what it's about just like the characters in the movie think they know Elle and dismiss her. Both are wrong.  Legally Blonde is not a deep movie, but it's fun and it strikes a cord. It's an enjoyable experience and Reese is entirely loveable as the goodhearted Elle. Elle has never had to apply herself or work for anything, so everyone just dismisses her as another dumb blonde. It's no surprise that when she puts her mind to it, she gets results! It's also very fun to watch her changing wardrobe and hairstyle. I know it's hard to believe, but the term guilty pleasure fits this movie to a tee. You don't have to work hard watching it.

Seriously, it is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and most of my friends and family fully support that opinion.  So take a chance and buy it!Reese Witherspoon makes a steller performance as Elle Woods, a drop-dead gorgeous blonde, ditzy as can be, who basically comes to one day and decides to attend Harvard Law School.  Why?  Because becoming a law student is the only way to win back the love of Warner Huntington III (played by hunk Matthew Davis).  And suprisingly, she manages to convince the Harvard admittance committee that her brains . . . or assets . . . will make her an excellent addition to the school.  Once she gets to Harvard, however, Elle is shocked to learn that everyone does NOT love her.  She faces hard classes for which she is expected to prepare, a professor who tosses her out of class, and finally discovers that Warner got engaged over the summer to a preppy Eastern girl.  But Elle is up to the challenge, rocketing to stardom even as a 1L (first-year law student to those not in the club).My 5-star recommendation comes from my love of a good lawyer joke, and the ability to laugh at our profession.  And this movie definitely does that.  You get to see that law school is filled with tough classes, hard profs, nasty law students, and stretching one to one's limits.  But you also see a woman with a truly good heart rise above all the pettiness she faces, and succeed by being true to herself.

That is until her boyfriend announces he's going to Harvard Law and dumps her because Elle's image doesn't fit into his future plans of a life in politics. Still in love with the superficial louse, Elle decides to get her man and applies to Harvard Law School. Her application video is quite funny in it's over the top approach.

The ex's new girlfriend is prim and proper, the ideal candidate's wife. She sets out to ridicule Elle, who sticks out like a sore thumb in this Ivy League enclave. After several setbacks, a depressed Elle finally finds a friend in the local beautician. Then encouraged by a seemingly sympathetic Professor,Elle decides to make the best out of her time at Harvard Law and does so with dogged determiniation (reminiscent of her performance in ELECTION).Reese does an incredible job considering the poor material she's given. While the premise is full of comic potential, it is little more than that--a premise. The story is never fully developed so her setbacks and victories are pretty much one note.

Will Elle discover that law is her true calling?  Will she turn out to be brilliant?  Will she amaze everyone in a courtroom scene?  Are you kidding, does the sun rise in the east?  The courtroom scene is about as plausible as the idea that she'd be allowed to keep her pet Chihuahua in a university residence hall, but hey, who cares?Part of the fun, if you've ever been near Harvard, is that although the Cambridge types are caricatured, they're not exaggerated all that much.

Legally Blonde is one of the most subversive mainstream movies I've seen in a long time. I would go so far as to call it a daring stab in the back to to the feminist backlash in its assertion that independent, empowered women come in all shapes, sizes and haircolors.This film, on the surface, appears to feed into our culture's stereotypes of women. We pigeonhole and define women by their appearances, and judge them through harsh dichotomies -- virgin/whore, beautiful and stupid/ugly and brainy. Such categorizations help prevent women from uniting and overthrowing the patriarchal establishment.Witherspoon's Elle must work hard to overcome the preconceptions that come w/ her background, appearance and experience, but she eventually succeeds in asserting her intelligence, her independence and her determination to a doubtful student body. The judgement she initially receives from her more traditionally &quot;feminist&quot;-ish fellow law students eventually turns to respect and friendship.

It rests on the shelf amidst my more distinguished DVD titles, but it has no need to feel ashamed; Legally Blonde probably gets more playtime than her neighbors.Simply put, I love this movie.  You can't fault a movie too much for just making you smile.  There are tons of ways in which this movie could be worse, but it comes out to be a really good flick.  No, you shouldn't invite your friends over for wine, cheese and Legally Blonde followed by philosophical discussions.  Unless you want to have philosophical discussions in a really good mood that are wholly unrelated to the movie.Legally Blonde just goes to show how good a formula can be, because this move is in every way another film that follows a formula, but I still can't shake my love for this film, so much so that despite the flaws that I see in the movie, I still give it 5 stars.The most prominent flaw in this movie is the fact that Elle is pretty much morally perfect.  People given to hating the sorority girl persona will also have distaste for Elle, and probably wouldn't agree with me that she's perfect.  But truly, there's not really a character flaw that might cause Elle's downfall.  She has to overcome other people's perceptions and there's no reason she should lose because aside from perkiness, she's got nothing holding her back.  Every other character has flaws coming out the nose.  The writers bank on the audience having the same distaste for Elle's lifestyle that the Harvard students in the movie do, and that's just lazy.  On that note, there's very little to love in anyone who isn't on Elle's side.  If it weren't for Elle's &quot;wining personality&quot; causing Vivian to side with her at the end of the movie, Vivian, like the rest of the characters who have it in for Elle would find herself at the end of the movie just as two dimensional as Enid, the feminist lesbian, or the guy who thinks too much of himself, or Victor Garber's character.However, I do actually come into the movie with the same negative preconceptions about sorority girls that allows me to enjoy the film.Reese Witherspoon carries the movie.  She could probably just skip around in front of the camera while everyone else forms a circle behind her and we would probably be watching an interesting film.  Fortunatley, that's not what we have here.  There's a fantastic supporting cast, what with Holland Taylor, Jennifer Coolidge, Victor Garber, Luke Wilson and Selma Blair to name a few.There are a lot of extras on this DVD, all of which are geared toward the target audience of perky blondes.  If you also stick this movie in the guilty pleasures category, then you will probably not be excited about the extra features.  The commentary is fun, even if we hear a little too much of &quot;Reese is great.&quot; On that note, its fun to hear her responses as she tries to graciously accept the compliments, but you can tell that she thinks one time is enough.The behind the scenes and making of featurettes are okay and worth a watch, but they definitely don't beg to be watched repeatedly.The deleted scenes are fun to watch, though you can tell why they were cut (namely because Vivian is entirely too mean).All in all, this movie probably deserves four stars, but I still think its worth the money that I paid for it.

To illustrate, just try to count  40 different hairstyles that decorates Elle's head.  And watch out the delightful semi-musical scene in the beauty salon, where Elle teaches how to catch guy's attention (with incredible 98 % success rate).  This scene is choreographed by no other than Toni Basil.  Enjoy it.Trivia: a little geeky student David who is given a suprising present form Elle is Oz Perkins, son of Anthony.",4,Prepare For Shocking Pink!!!

Unfortunately Warner has bigger plans and wishes to study law at Harvard University and only has plans to break up their relationship.  In order to prove that she is not just a stereotypical blonde bimbo with no brains, Elle successfully applies to Harvard whereby she attempts to charm over her ex-boyfriend by proving that she has the brains as well as the body.Apart from annoying girls obsessed with shopping and beauty parlours (hence my connection with Clueless) and the part of Elle being overwhelmingly irritating the film does have some comical parts.  During the film you can also play a game of spot the instantly recognisable B-list actor. You will find yourself shouting aloud: - ""oh that's the guy from `Titanic'"" (Victor Garber) and ""oh he's from hmm can't remember"" (Luke Wilson)...and ""oh wasn't he in `Bring it on'"" (Richard Hillman). ""Oh, oh and she was in Final Destination"" (Ali Larter).Many have congratulated Reese Witherspoon on a splendid performance in this film, but I'm not quite entirely sure she was not just playing herself.

It sets out to be a totlally formula movie -- then violates the formula at every possible point.  Is Reese Witherspoon a great actress?  No.  But she carries this role -- including the transition between CULA and Harvard Law School.  Even the idea that she doesn't get her boyfriend back at the end because she DOESN'T WANT HIM is fresh and original.  And who can forget the director pulling the camera back from her pool-scene video admissions essay to that room full of Harvard ""suits"" discussing why she should be admitted.The script is intelligent, and if it includes a few logical holes, so what?  It carries them off.  I have to say that the actress (I don't remember her name) who played Brooke Taylor Windham was wonderful.  Her innocence, her unaltering faith in Elle, and so on were understated and believable.But of all the bits in the film, the most brilliant (aside from uncovering that the pool boy was gay) was the use of Racquel Welch as Windham's ex-wife.  Glamour woman extraordinaire, and the first look we have of her is in the mud-room in a spa, wrapped in a blanket, with a mud-pack on her face and a cucumber slice in each eye.  It takes an actor with a real sense of the absurd to parody herself like that.Oh, yes.  The resolution of the plot may have been absurd too, but it hangs together logically.
