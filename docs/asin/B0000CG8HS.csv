776342,A3I389XOSTO0F9,B0000CG8HS,"Antonio Palacios ""Gimme music!""","[11, 11]","Stanley guitar playing is powerful, emtional, impressive. He plays the guitar like a piano, tapping with his fingers the entire fretboard. He also can play with two guitar at the time, doing the comping and the soloing at the same time. But the concert is not only Jordan. Charnett Moffet is an unbelievable bassist: He play with soul, I enjoy see him playing and when he enters to the solo... whoa! he shows eveything he knows. Tommy Campbell at the drums is another important piece in this concert.Track list:01. Flying home: 3/5 Stanley starts the concert warming with a beautiful song. He plays solo.02. Cousin Mary: 4/5 Band joins Stanley. John Coltrane's standardt is played flawless.03. Autumn leaves: 5/5 Incredible playing, impressive soloing.04. All the children: 4/5 Another solo piece by Stanley.05. One less bell to answer: 2/5 Not my favorite piece.06. Eleanor Rigby: 5/5 The Beatle's cover. Jordan at his best.07. Willow weep with me 3/5 Nice song.08. What's going on: 4/5 This is a beautiful theme.09. Lady in my life: 5/5 So emotional, the electric bass is perfect for this song.10. Stairway to heaven: 5/5 Concert end with this Led Zepeelin cover.Bonus: Return expedition Charnett Moffet is a killer bassist!Highly recommended to any Jordan's fan, guitar players and jazz fans.",5,Impressive,1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,1295,"['Stanley', 'guitar', 'playing', 'powerful', 'emtional', 'impressive', 'guitar', 'piano', 'tapping', 'fingers', 'entire', 'fretboard', 'also', 'can', 'play', 'two', 'guitar', 'time', 'doing', 'comping', 'soloing', 'same', 'time', 'concert', 'not', 'only', 'Jordan', 'Charnett', 'Moffet', 'unbelievable', 'bassist', 'play', 'soul', 'enjoy', 'see', 'playing', 'when', 'solo', 'whoa', 'eveything', 'Tommy', 'Campbell', 'drums', 'important', 'piece', 'concert.Track', 'list:01', 'Flying', 'home', '3/5', 'Stanley', 'concert', 'warming', 'beautiful', 'song', 'solo.02', 'Cousin', 'Mary', '4/5', 'Band', 'joins', 'Stanley', 'John', 'Coltrane', 'standardt', 'played', 'flawless.03', 'Autumn', '5/5', 'Incredible', 'playing', 'impressive', 'soloing.04', 'children', '4/5', 'solo', 'piece', 'Stanley.05', 'One', 'less', 'bell', 'answer', '2/5', 'Not', 'favorite', 'piece.06', 'Eleanor', 'Rigby', '5/5', 'Beatle', 'cover', 'Jordan', 'best.07', 'Willow', 'weep', '3/5', 'Nice', 'song.08', 'What', 'going', '4/5', 'beautiful', 'theme.09', 'Lady', 'life', '5/5', 'So', 'emotional', 'electric', 'bass', 'perfect', 'song.10', 'Stairway', 'heaven', '5/5', 'Concert', 'end', 'Led', 'Zepeelin', 'cover.Bonus', 'Return', 'expedition', 'Charnett', 'Moffet', 'killer', 'bassist', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'Jordan', 'fan', 'guitar', 'players', 'jazz', 'fans']",N/A

This is a superb performance by Stanley, and in my opinion is the best live release in terms of musical performance of all of his. The sound and picture on this are of the highest quality, better than any other music DVDs I own.My favorite song of the concert is &quot;One Less Bell to Answer&quot;. He plays this with such incredible emotion and with an amazing arrangement that I am just mesmerized when I watch it. In my opinion this is the best song I've ever heard him perform live.Other highlights include &quot;All the Children&quot; which is performed beautifully, and &quot;Flying Home&quot;. Other songs like &quot;Cousin Mary&quot; sound really great with his trio. They have a very lively sound.The interview and bonus track are cool too. The bass and drum solos are neat on the bonus track &quot;Return Expedition&quot;.If you like Stanley, this video is a must have. Or if you are a guitar player and like to see amazing performances, you need to buy this too.",5,Superb performance,1072742400,"12 30, 2003",2003,1047,"['got', 'DVD', 'Christmas', ""'ve"", 'watched', '10', 'times', 'already', 'superb', 'performance', 'Stanley', 'opinion', 'best', 'live', 'release', 'terms', 'musical', 'performance', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'highest', 'quality', 'better', 'other', 'music', 'DVDs', 'own.My', 'favorite', 'song', 'concert', 'quot', 'One', 'Less', 'Bell', 'Answer', 'quot', 'such', 'incredible', 'emotion', 'amazing', 'arrangement', 'am', 'just', 'mesmerized', 'when', 'watch', 'opinion', 'best', 'song', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'perform', 'live.Other', 'highlights', 'include', 'quot', 'Children', 'quot', 'performed', 'beautifully', 'quot', 'Flying', 'Home', 'quot', 'Other', 'songs', 'quot', 'Cousin', 'Mary', 'quot', 'really', 'great', 'trio', 'have', 'very', 'lively', 'sound.The', 'interview', 'bonus', 'track', 'are', 'cool', 'too', 'bass', 'drum', 'solos', 'are', 'neat', 'bonus', 'track', 'quot', 'Return', 'Expedition', 'quot', 'Stanley', 'video', 'must', 'have', 'are', 'guitar', 'player', 'see', 'amazing', 'performances', 'need', 'buy', 'too']",N/A

I was totally uninterested.  I tried listening to jazz before, but just couldn't get into it.  I was reading a magazine while the DVD was playing and then about 10 minutes into the DVD, Stanley Jordan had my full, undivided attention.When Stanley was playing two guitars at once, it was like he was performing a magic trick.  I mean how can that be physically possible?  When I watched and heard Stanley play I didn't say, ""wow, that guy is good,"" all I could say, over and over, was ""holy s--t!""He's a true artist in every sense of the word.  His music is beautiful and just lures you right in, and his performance--you can't take your eyes off him.  It seems like he's completely lost in his own music and oblivious to everything around him but his guitar.I can't believe I never heard of Stanley Jordan until last year, but I'm glad I did because I didn't realize what I was missing.",5,"I Didn't Like or Understand Jazz, until...",1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,1005,"['saw', 'DVD', 'boyfriend', 'husband', 'now', 'brought', 'over', 'said', 'have', 'see', 'popped', 'player', 'was', 'totally', 'uninterested', 'tried', 'listening', 'jazz', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'was', 'reading', 'magazine', 'DVD', 'was', 'playing', 'then', '10', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'Stanley', 'Jordan', 'had', 'full', 'undivided', 'attention.When', 'Stanley', 'was', 'playing', 'two', 'guitars', 'once', 'was', 'was', 'performing', 'magic', 'trick', 'mean', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'physically', 'possible', 'When', 'watched', 'heard', 'Stanley', 'play', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'wow', 'guy', 'good', 'could', 'say', 'was', 'holy', 's', 't', 'true', 'artist', 'sense', 'word', 'music', 'beautiful', 'just', 'lures', 'right', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'completely', 'lost', 'own', 'music', 'oblivious', 'everything', 'around', 'guitar.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'never', 'heard', 'Stanley', 'Jordan', 'last', 'year', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'what', 'was', 'missing']",N/A
