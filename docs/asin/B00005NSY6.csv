670061,A1F7YU6O5RU432,B00005NSY6,Angela Streiff,"[2, 2]","Dark Days is unique in how it's filmed. To start, it's all done in black and white. At first I wondered why, since it can sometimes make sections of the film more difficult to see. But after watching it twice, I realize that it really helps the viewer focus on the films characters and their stories and how they had created a small village like community, rather than how dirty everything is and unappealing the environment was. This was most apparent when they showed a clip of the bucket the homeless all use as a bathroom. In color this would turn someones stomach, but in black and white you were able to get past the grossness and see how it fits into their ingenuity in creating their homes.Dark Days focuses on how the homeless who live underground in the city have worked to create new lives and homes in these tunnels. Interviews with them tell about how they collect their items to build them, how they make money, find food and even set up electricity in their shacks. There is some background with the different people, some being homeless from drug use, others for different reasons. You see how they make friends, have pets, talk about their hopes and dreams and are just like any one else.There  is some swearing and brief moments of drug use for anyone concerned, but nothing too extreme. The worst scene was the bucket public toilet.The end of the film was a complete surprise to me and I have to say I loved it.

The individuals in the film speak for themselves and it is their words that reveal the truth of the matter.The film is interesting in its segmentation into various 'topics' (e.g. rats) and the various levels of how these individuals deal with the living situation is quite moving. There are enough diverse opinions given that one gets a good understanding of the 'glories' of such a life yet it also reveals that it is not always as it appears.My only critique would be that this is but a small segment of the population and there are many who are less well spoken and who are far worse off in terms of problems (mental health, substance abuse or other) whose lives are considerably worse, whose stories are not seen.But as a whole this is by far the least judgmental and sensationalized film on the subject I have yet seen.Definitley get the DVD.  It contains updates of the people in the film and an excellent interview with the director himself.  The way the film came together is almost as fascinating as the stories of the individuals in the film.  More importantly, I believe, you'll see where his heart was in making the film and it really adds insight to the film revealing that it is much more than 'just' a documentary.There are also clips of footage that didn't make it into the original film.

You've got very little money, no resources, but a big heart. What could you possibly do to make a dent in their population?If you're Marc Singer, the man behind this Sundance Award winning documentary, you found a way to do quite a lot.For a person who'd never touched a movie camera before starting in on this ""project"", one can see why this film impacts its viewers on multiple levels. Shot in grainy black-and-white 16mm film, this documentary gives us a startlingly real-life look at several homeless people living in self-built shanties in the Amtrak tunnels under the city. No light makes it down there, except whenever a train skirts by or via the makeshift lighting this weird community has produced by tapping into Amtrak's electrical system.Marc Singer delves into this society. And I mean he DELVES. Mr. Singer gave up living on the surface and slunk into this netherworld for two years in order to shoot his film. And who did he use as grips, sound assistants, and lighting experts? The homeless themselves.More interesting than the film itself is how it got made. After watching the documentary, I went ahead and looked over the special features on the DVD and found a ""Making Of"" track which focused on Mr. Singer and how he accomplished his film making. This showed the incredible lack of understanding of anything related to filming and those who helped him out, both in teaching him and by giving him financial help so that the documentary made it out to the public. We also get to see the amazing multiple awards that the documentary won at Sundance; an incredible set of scenes that contrasts starkly with what Mr. Singer had gone through in order to make this film a reality.Never giving up on his newfound tunnel companions, never letting financial devastation overtake him, never giving up creative control, all added to the success of the film and my enjoyment of all aspects of it. Bravo, Mr. Singer.(You might be asking what happens to the tunnel-bound homeless. It's a perfect ending to the film, so you'll have to watch it.

IMPORTANT: watch the 'making of' documentary that's in the extra features, which in a much clearer way shows just how involved Singer became in these people's lives.

This is very much a mood piece, and you need to be in the right mood (i.e., sort of dark and moody).  This documentary leaves a lot of loose ends.  If you don't like living with that kind of tension, you may not like the film: don't watch it.

The other reviewers have pointed out how unsentimental, yet full the depiction of these people is. I agree. I'd go further. It's like an angel was dropped out of the sky to make this movie, and then vanished.Okay, so that's hyperbole.But that's the kind of whacky thought that occurs to you when you watch the hand-twisting, blushing director describe the movie he made - perhaps the best frickin' movie ever made about homeless people...EVER - the fact that making the flick drove him temporarily into homelessness, the fact that this guy out of NOWHERE wins all the dang Sundance awards a few years back not only for the message, but for the astoundingly beautiful cinematography, yet the kid never made films before... yadda yadda yadda.This is a landmark film. More hyperbole, perhaps. But the plight of the homeless is one of the biggest problems facing the industrial West. And yet...and yet...zero discussion. Zero concern. Instead, we get a lot of lip about how the homeless are lazy and shiftless and live off the government, etc. ""Dark Days"" shows that the homeless are people. Humans.

670077,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005NSY6,Linda Linguvic,"[44, 47]","This documentary won three separate awards in the Sundance Film Festival in 2000.  I can well understand why.  At that time there was a whole colony of homeless people who lived underground in the subway tunnels in New York City.  It was dark and damp and full of rats, but yet they preferred it to a homeless shelter.  There, they erected their personal shacks and struggled for survival, venturing out to forage in garbage cans for food as well as for stuff to sell.  British Producer Marc Singer was so fascinated by these people that he ventured into these tunnels and spent two years getting to know them.  Eventually he wound up living with them and made this film, using the homeless people themselves as crew.The film is unique in that it shows these homeless people as human beings and the viewer gets to know them as individuals.  Yes, many of them have drug problems, but they still have lives, hopes and dreams, a tough will to survive and often a sense of humor.  They manage to cook meals on makeshift stoves and there is a feeling of camaraderie among them.  We also see their ingenuity with the very little they have.  And realize that their days are full of hard work just to survive.  The conditions they live in are absolutely squalid.  But this is their home.During the course of the film, Amtrak decided to rid the tunnels of the people and homeless advocates negotiated for them to be placed in real housing.  By the end of the film we see them in real apartments.  There is an upbeat quality to this ending of the film.However, the DVD is much more than the actual film.  There's a 40-minute interview with the filmmaker, Marc Singer, which is equally as fascinating as the film.  I hadn't realized that he was a non-professional person who had never made a film before.  He spent all his money on a camera and had to learn how to load the film.  He became obsessed with making the film, and became homeless himself after starting to edit the more than 50 hours of film he had shot.  There were many delays and setbacks but eventually the film was made and received many accolades.On the DVD we also get to find out what happened to the many individual homeless people who we got to know through the film.  A few had died but most of them had moved on and were leading more productive lives.  It felt good to know this and to realize that Marc Jacobs had really done a tremendous good deed by merely making this film.  I applaud him in every way.  And I also applaud the film.

The murky, black-and-white photography captures well the dim and grim world within which these people live; trains hurtle forward into the frame, seemingly out of nowhere, and one gets a strong sense of how precariously the men and women of this subterranean world are living.  As the film progresses, we learn about how each of these people came to be a tunnel dweller, and we see how they scratch out a living in the topside world before returning to their underground homes.  The film takes a startling turn when Amtrak, the owner of the tunnel, announces its intention of evicting the tunnel dwellers, creating a crisis situation for the tunnel community.  The pervasive harsh language, and the film's footage of drug use, may be upsetting to some viewers, but I for one find it more upsetting to reflect that there are people living this way in the wealthiest country in human history.  The soundtrack music by DJ Shadow accompanies perfectly what we see on screen -- the pessimistic quality of much of the film, as well as its surprisingly hopeful conclusion.

Everything about the film, from its graffiti-esque box font to its DJ Shadow soundtrack to Singer's horrendous diction, for which subtitles should have been used a good portion of the time, leads me to this conclusion.Singer's documentary, anecdotally made with the help of fellow mole people, details thirty days of Singer's life in the abandoned train tunnels that honeycomb subterranean New York (the same subject to be found in Viktor David's vastly superior documentary In Search of the Mole People). For the most part, it's exactly what you'd expect from such a thing, just chronicling the day-to-day life of Singer and his peers, though Amtrak throws in some drama towards the end when they send out a general eviction notice.This isn't a bad movie, and it's an inherently fascinating subject; as long as you can understand what's being said, you'll find yourself glued to the screen.

It got to be a bit much at times.  However, I now feel somewhat petty about getting angry with people who out of desperation (sometimes fueled by drug or alcohol problems) approached me for money.  DARK DAYS opened my eyes to the plight of the homeless more than any other film I've seen.  It did such a wonderful job of humanizing its subjects.  When I watched the ""making of"" featurette on the DVD I understood how it accomplished that feat - the filmmaker lived among his homeless subjects in rat infested tunnels for an extended period of time and, in effect, became one of them.  It's very obvious that he earned their respect and trust - something that really comes through in the film.  In fact, I consider Marc Singer, the film's director, to be a remarkable human being.  I sincerely believe he did this great work of art to help his homeless friends get out of the dark, dank tunnels in which so many of them lived for over a decade.  My hat is off to Mr. Singer.

What follows is, at times, wrenching: the interview with the woman whose children were killed in a house fire; tender: the man with pictures of his favorite pets; revolting: the cuts to the lighter snapped on, then on again, then on again, then on again, then on again--always lighting another crack pipe.The neighborhood is broken up--you decide if it is an act of compassion or an act of cruelty--when Amtrak officials evict the squatters. After the residents are filmed destroying their shacks--you decide if the destruction of these shelters is in celebration or in anger--the film updates the lives of some of the residents. You decide if this lifestyle--scavenging for discarding food, hunting dumpsters for gay porn to sell; improvising alarms to protect themselves-- has been hurtful or helpful to the former residents.

Our schools?)",5,"Homeless, yes; helpless, no",1213056000,"06 10, 2008",2008,1049,"['Ready', 'wonderland', 'Early', 'film', 'homeless', 'man', 'passage', 'lowers', 'Amtrak', 'tunnel', 'home', 'residents', 'long-standing', 'shanty', 'town', 'What', 'times', 'wrenching', 'interview', 'woman', 'children', 'were', 'killed', 'house', 'fire', 'tender', 'man', 'pictures', 'favorite', 'pets', 'revolting', 'cuts', 'lighter', 'snapped', 'then', 'again', 'then', 'again', 'then', 'again', 'then', 'again', 'always', 'lighting', 'crack', 'pipe.The', 'neighborhood', 'broken', 'up', 'decide', 'act', 'compassion', 'act', 'cruelty', 'when', 'Amtrak', 'officials', 'evict', 'squatters', 'residents', 'are', 'filmed', 'destroying', 'shacks', 'decide', 'destruction', 'shelters', 'celebration', 'anger', 'film', 'lives', 'residents', 'decide', 'lifestyle', 'scavenging', 'discarding', 'food', 'hunting', 'dumpsters', 'gay', 'porn', 'sell', 'improvising', 'alarms', 'protect', 'been', 'hurtful', 'helpful', 'former', 'residents', 'Can', 'prisons', 'boast', 'such', 'success', 'schools']",Dark Days

Go pop a Matt Damon movie in.This is a great movie on two fronts. First of all, the camera work and editing is perfect, and secondly, it seems to me that Singer's approach to this film is to simply show the viewer that homeless people are not the paper-thin cliche's that our mind conjures up when we hear the word, but three-dimensional human beings that have the same concerns, and live the same life that any of us do.What is so incredible about this movie is that you expect to see something truly bizarre occurring in those tunnels, and what you actually see is a group of people, doing their thing, just like anyone else. They are a diverse group, which in itself is unexpected. As the film progresses, their plywood huts really begin to seem like any other community, except in a tunnel. It's surreal.I don't think for a second that Singer wants us to pity these people, honestly a lot of them aren't doing too bad (considering the circumstances). I think the point here is just to observe, and to see that these ""freaks"" are pretty much just standard-issue human beings.",4,Looking into the unknown...,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,1212,"['finding', 'mundane.I', 'would', 'suggest', 'people', 'are', 'slamming', 'movie', 'type', 'flick', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'Go', 'pop', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'movie', 'in.This', 'great', 'movie', 'two', 'fronts', 'First', 'all', 'camera', 'work', 'editing', 'perfect', 'secondly', 'Singer', 'approach', 'film', 'simply', 'show', 'viewer', 'homeless', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'paper-thin', 'cliche', 'mind', 'up', 'when', 'hear', 'word', 'three-dimensional', 'human', 'beings', 'have', 'same', 'concerns', 'live', 'same', 'life', 'so', 'incredible', 'movie', 'expect', 'see', 'something', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'occurring', 'tunnels', 'what', 'actually', 'see', 'group', 'people', 'doing', 'thing', 'just', 'anyone', 'else', 'are', 'diverse', 'group', 'unexpected', 'film', 'progresses', 'plywood', 'huts', 'really', 'begin', 'seem', 'other', 'community', 'tunnel', 'surreal.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'second', 'Singer', 'pity', 'people', 'honestly', 'lot', 'are', ""n't"", 'doing', 'too', 'bad', 'considering', 'circumstances', 'think', 'point', 'here', 'just', 'observe', 'see', 'freaks', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'standard-issue', 'human', 'beings']",Dark Days

The film seems to have no real storyline behind showing shots of different homeless people squatting in different areas. We know they are in a dark tunnel somewhere, but all we really see is a trash-strewn, graffitied area. It could be anywhere. The use of black and white to showcase the film was not a good idea, it makes the film seem outdated and in the past...without contrast between light and dark, we have no idea what the place is really like.I watched 30 minutes of this film and didn't want to sit through anymore of the homeless people ranting. Some of their speech is difficult to understand. I started to tune it out. There is no narration in the film.There are many ways to make a film about the homeless and this one really fell through. I have no idea where the good reviews came from.It really is a film for those who want to watch homeless people ramble. What I  learned from the film is that alot of the people in the tunnel are addicted to crack, and one of them sells cds and dirty movies on the street to make money. They also rummage through the trash, push shopping carts and there are mice scurrying in the tunnels.",1,Not good,1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,1194,"['amateur', 'documentary', 'attempt', 'film', 'have', 'real', 'storyline', 'showing', 'shots', 'different', 'homeless', 'people', 'squatting', 'different', 'areas', 'know', 'are', 'dark', 'tunnel', 'somewhere', 'really', 'see', 'trash-strewn', 'graffitied', 'area', 'could', 'be', 'anywhere', 'use', 'black', 'white', 'showcase', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'film', 'seem', 'outdated', 'past', 'contrast', 'light', 'dark', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'place', 'really', 'like.I', 'watched', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'sit', 'anymore', 'homeless', 'people', 'ranting', 'speech', 'difficult', 'understand', 'started', 'tune', 'out', 'narration', 'are', 'many', 'ways', 'make', 'film', 'homeless', 'one', 'really', 'fell', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'good', 'reviews', 'came', 'from.It', 'really', 'film', 'who', 'want', 'watch', 'homeless', 'people', 'ramble', 'What', 'learned', 'film', 'alot', 'people', 'tunnel', 'are', 'addicted', 'crack', 'one', 'cds', 'dirty', 'movies', 'street', 'make', 'money', 'also', 'rummage', 'trash', 'push', 'shopping', 'carts', 'are', 'mice', 'scurrying', 'tunnels']",Dark Days
