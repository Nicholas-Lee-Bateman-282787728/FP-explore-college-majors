Fed up with his legal representation DiNorscio also chose to defend himself in what would become, at 21 months, the longest criminal trial in U.S. history.As much of the action takes place within the courtroom the lawyers and mobsters - there's a whole table of defendants - all jockeying for position in an overcrowded courtroom with the ecstatically inexperienced Jackie mounting arguments based on wily good humor as he tries to win over the jury with his ribald and off-center jokes.Directed by Sidney Lumet, Find Me Guilty is more intent to let the dialogue move the story along, using satire to present these beloved mobsters. We all know that these men are a bunch of crooks, intent to scam the system and even commit murder from time to time, but Lumet is more concerned with building their case on an amoral smugness, presenting them as a bunch of big, cuddly family men, who in the end, just want to be respected and loved.There are some good supporting players here particularly Peter Dinklage who plays an eloquent dwarf attorney and who holds the courtroom rapt with his every utterance. And Annabella Sciorra shows up in a quick, charged turn as Jackie's former wife. The obnoxious lead government prosecutor played by Linus Roache injects some much-needed life into the proceedings, especially later on.Ironically, the prosecutor is more insufferable and loathsome many of the mobsters. I guess that's why the jury reached the verdict they did and it also shows that the government can be just as ruthless as the people they attempt to bring to justice.I feel a little sorry for poor Vin, he's obviously a competent actor, but in this case an overly talky script hampers him and unfortunately he has a voice that rarely rises about the monotone. He looks good with his hairpiece and you really believe he could be a mobster - and there's a priceless scene involving some flatulence and car windows - but the courtroom scenes prove that the role may have been just a little bit beyond him.The script also leaves some important questions unanswered, such as the jury's verdict, and the movie always appear to be true even although much of the courtroom dialogue was taken from trial transcripts, but this doesn't mean the movie always rings true.There are some fun moments - after a heart attack, one gangster attends the rest of the trial in a hospital bed and there's lots of irreverent profanity thrown every which way, but the film, which clocks in at just over two hours comes across as overlong and stodgy - a little bit like the trial itself - and in the end, you really have to wonder whether these guys were as funny as the move makes them out to be.

I saw the trailers but wasn't really sure what to expect from Vin Diesel in a very different role.  I have to say, that after about 10 minutes, I stopped seeing Vin Diesel in make up and totally bought into his portrayal of ""Fat Jack"" DiNorscio.  There was a good bit of crass gangster humor, but I ate it up in the same way you would a naughty secret.  Peter Dinklage was wonderful as a lead attorney (and yes, his height was a non-issue, because he is such a strong actor), Ron Silver's strength and sensitivity as the judge was excellent and Linus Roache as the prosecutor was engaging (I didn't know whether to cheer for or against him and he was the ""good guy"").  I can't even begin to speak of the supporting actors whose mob idiosyncrisies were wonderfully played.  I only wish we could have seen more of Annabella Sciorra and Vin Diesel on screen together.

This possibly was as he was in jail already for so long anyway and he had decided already not to turn on his friends that to him the case did not matter that much.

But most times these productions focus on what happens as the families war with one another or deal with the imprisonment of their closest members. Rarely do we get to see what happens in between these two; that is to say, the courtroom drama. This is probably due to the fact that courtroom films can be rather boring and confined. There are exceptions (My Cousin Vinnie being the penultimate one), but rarely can these stories be wildly entertaining. Their basis for success is in finding an actor who can carry the story. An actor with a serious set of chops who's not afraid to bury themselves in a part. Someone like Al Pacino perhaps.One thing that should draw your attention to FIND ME GUILTY is that it's directed by none other than Sidney Lumet, someone who's given us such gems as Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico (both of them being outstanding Pacino flicks). Although Lumet was unable to retain Pacino for Find Me Guilty, he did find someone most might find rather unconventional: Vin Diesel. Vin has, in the recent past, been Mr. Action. His career is full of roles such as xXx and The Fast and The Furious, and the cultishly popular sci-fi movie, Pitch Black. Before these action-o-rama movies, though, Mr. Diesel was trying to build himself into a serious actor. Some viewers might remember his role as Private Caparzo in Saving Private Ryan. His gruff but caring character in that movie was cut short thanks to his sympathy for a French family and their daughter. Remember that? If you do, you might think that Vin Diesel probably has more beneath that bulky exterior than just a tough guy wielding fast cars or Riddick-style speed. And director Sidney Lumet saw that potential.Vin Diesel has cemented his role as a quality actor with Find Me Guilty. His portrayal of Jackie DiNorscio, a ""family"" fall-guy, is vivid, funny, and heartbreaking. Based on the true story of the longest and most costliest mob trial ever (lasting nearly two years and with more than 20 attorneys), the courtroom scripts were incorporated into the film with razor sharp precision. The big plug for the film is that it shows Jackie's refusal to have an attorney defend him, so he defends himself (note: Jackie has a sixth grade education). Disrupting normal courtroom procedures, Jackie often has the chambers and the jury laughing hysterically at his anti-attorney antics. Judge Finestein (Ron Silver, THE WEST WING TV series) has to constantly reign in Jackie for fear of having the proceedings fall into disarray. Attorneys for both the prosecution AND the defense continually wonder if he's helping one side versus hurting it; they just can't tell.That we care about someone we probably shouldn't be (these families deal in hardcore drugs, the sex trade, and extortion) is a credit to screenwriters Lumet and T.J. Mancini. Similar in scope to Thank You For Smoking (i.e., cheering on the ""bad guy""), this movie's message is also intriguing in a very human way. We shouldn't be hoping for a not guilty verdict, but there we are, doing exactly that. This is, as previously mentioned, in no small part thanks to Vin Diesel's awesome performance.A noteworthy leap forward for Mr. Diesel's career, his morally perplexing character portrayal will have audiences laughing, thinking and, in the end, grudgingly cheering.",4,Vin Diesel: More Than Just An Action Hero,1165190400,"12 4, 2006",2006,3424,"['Sopranos', 'Goodfellas', 'Godfather', 'Casino', 'American', 'cinema', 'television', 'rife', 'stories', 'mafia', 'most', 'times', 'productions', 'focus', 'what', 'families', 'war', 'one', 'deal', 'imprisonment', 'closest', 'members', 'Rarely', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'two', 'say', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'probably', 'due', 'fact', 'courtroom', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'boring', 'confined', 'are', 'exceptions', 'My', 'Cousin', 'Vinnie', 'being', 'penultimate', 'one', 'rarely', 'can', 'stories', 'be', 'wildly', 'entertaining', 'basis', 'success', 'finding', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'carry', 'story', 'actor', 'serious', 'set', 'chops', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'bury', 'part', 'Someone', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'perhaps.One', 'thing', 'should', 'draw', 'attention', 'FIND', 'ME', 'GUILTY', 'directed', 'none', 'other', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'someone', 'who', 'given', 'such', 'gems', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'Serpico', 'being', 'outstanding', 'Pacino', 'flicks', 'Lumet', 'was', 'unable', 'retain', 'Pacino', 'Find', 'Me', 'Guilty', 'did', 'find', 'someone', 'most', 'might', 'find', 'rather', 'unconventional', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'Vin', 'recent', 'past', 'been', 'Mr.', 'Action', 'career', 'full', 'roles', 'such', 'xXx', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'cultishly', 'popular', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'action-o-rama', 'movies', 'though', 'Mr.', 'Diesel', 'was', 'trying', 'build', 'serious', 'actor', 'viewers', 'might', 'remember', 'role', 'Private', 'Caparzo', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'gruff', 'caring', 'character', 'movie', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'thanks', 'sympathy', 'French', 'family', 'daughter', 'Remember', 'do', 'might', 'think', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'probably', 'more', 'beneath', 'exterior', 'just', 'tough', 'guy', 'wielding', 'fast', 'cars', 'Riddick-style', 'speed', 'director', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'saw', 'potential.Vin', 'Diesel', 'cemented', 'role', 'quality', 'actor', 'Find', 'Me', 'Guilty', 'portrayal', 'Jackie', 'DiNorscio', 'family', 'fall-guy', 'vivid', 'funny', 'heartbreaking', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'longest', 'most', 'costliest', 'mob', 'trial', 'ever', 'lasting', 'nearly', 'two', 'years', 'more', '20', 'attorneys', 'courtroom', 'scripts', 'were', 'incorporated', 'film', 'razor', 'sharp', 'precision', 'big', 'plug', 'film', 'Jackie', 'refusal', 'have', 'attorney', 'defend', 'so', 'note', 'Jackie', 'sixth', 'grade', 'education', 'Disrupting', 'normal', 'courtroom', 'procedures', 'Jackie', 'often', 'chambers', 'jury', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'anti-attorney', 'antics', 'Judge', 'Finestein', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'THE', 'WEST', 'WING', 'TV', 'series', 'constantly', 'reign', 'Jackie', 'fear', 'having', 'proceedings', 'fall', 'disarray', 'Attorneys', 'prosecution', 'defense', 'continually', 'wonder', 'helping', 'one', 'side', 'hurting', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell.That', 'care', 'someone', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'families', 'deal', 'hardcore', 'drugs', 'sex', 'trade', 'extortion', 'credit', 'screenwriters', 'Lumet', 'T.J.', 'Mancini', 'Similar', 'scope', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'i.e.', 'cheering', 'bad', 'guy', 'movie', 'message', 'also', 'intriguing', 'very', 'human', 'way', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'hoping', 'not', 'guilty', 'verdict', 'there', 'are', 'doing', 'exactly', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'small', 'part', 'thanks', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'awesome', 'performance.A', 'noteworthy', 'forward', 'Mr.', 'Diesel', 'career', 'morally', 'perplexing', 'character', 'portrayal', 'will', 'have', 'audiences', 'laughing', 'thinking', 'end', 'grudgingly', 'cheering']",N/A

Early in his career he made 12 Angry Men; at a later point he made The Verdict now he turns his attention back to the court room with Find Me Guilty.Loosely based on New York's attempt to bring down organized crime in the early 1980's Find Me Guilty tells the story of one of the longest trials in American history which ended in a unanimous victory for the defendants rather than the US Attorney. Vin Diesel plays Jackie DiNorsio one of the defendants who fed up with the services of his lawyer who just got Jackie a thirty year narcotics decides to represent himself.The film, while not well received, provides an outstanding vehicle for Diesel to break away from his usual action role to take on a more developed character.

988780,A1G0EBQYLN6STU,B000FFJ826,Cinephiliac,"[2, 2]","""Find Me Guilty"" is the story of the longest mob trial in American history. Although 20 members of the notorious New Jersey Lucchese crime family were indicted and tried together on 76 separate charges of racketeering and conspiracy under the RICO Act, director Sidney Lumet has made Giacomo ""Jackie Dee"" DiNorscio (Vin Diesel) the centerpiece for the film--just as he became a focus in the newspapers covering the trial.In one of the film's first scenes, DiNorscio is asleep in bed when his cousin comes into the room and shoots him. Waking up, DiNorscio sees his cousin and asks him: ""Why are you doing this? I love you. We're family."" Afterwards, recuperating in the hospital, Jackie Dee seems to bear no animosity towards his cousin, declaring that he is a junkie and can't help it, and that he loves him anyway. DiNorscio demonstrates a strange, all encompassing loyalty to both his immediate and his crime family. Already in the middle of serving a 30 year sentence for drug trafficking and possession, when DiNorscio is offered the chance to drastically cut his sentence by testifying against other members of his crime family, he doesn't hesitate in his decision to serve his full term rather than 'rat out' his friends.Although possessing only a fifth grade education, the flamboyant DiNorscio decided to represent himself at trial. DiNorscio compensated for his lack of technical skill and procedural knowledge with a rough personal charisma and a rather ""bad boy"" sense of humor. Referring to himself as a ""gagster, not a gangster,"" DiNorscio frequently managed to hijack the proceedings. (A prologue at the beginning of the film states that most of the dialogue during the courtroom scenes is lifted verbatim from the actual trial transcripts.) The trial itself was something of a spectacle. With 20 defendants and their respective counsel present at all times in the courtroom, the sheer volume of people at the defendants' table was staggering. On the downside, the film suffers from some of the same problems as the trial. The film is heavy with courtroom procedure and what seems to be endless testimony. I personally found this fascinating, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea. The memorable supporting cast includes Ron Silver as the presiding judge, Peter Dinklage as co-counsel Ben Klandis, and Linus Roache as Sean Kierney--the lead prosecuting attorney who has the thankless job of trying to get the jury to see how dangerous these men are.At the end of the film, the audience is left with some very conflicted feelings. In essence, you find yourself rooting for the bad guys--not fictitious bad guys--but real life career criminals whose trial is presented in film form.

This resulted in the longest criminal trial in U.S. history. No stranger to the courtroom (12 Angry Men,The Verdict), veteran filmmaker Sidney Lumet helmed this 2006 dramedy, and while some of his prowess is evident on the edges, the film is a relatively lifeless slog through the exhausting duration of the trial. Lumet, who co-wrote the script with T.J. Mancini and Robert J. McCrea, seems to think the story is compelling enough itself without having to invest much in terms of story structure to the production. It turns out to be a key error in judgment.The problems start with the toupee-challenged Diesel who seems to be left out to dry by Lumet, as his lunk-headed, clownish presence makes DiNorscio's dilemma less than palpable. After refusing a plea bargain from hyper-obsessed federal prosecutor Sean Kierney, DiNorscio chooses to represent himself in court, and it would have taken a more outsized personality than Diesel's to emphasize the dramatic impact of this ploy. Fortunately, Lumet still shows an idiosyncratic sense in casting many of the other roles, and three actors stand out. First, Peter Dinklage (The Station Agent) lends a becalming authority to the role of one of the defense attorneys and as it turns out, the one ally DiNorscio can trust. That he is a dwarf comes up only when a platform is wheeled into the courtroom for him to provide arguments. Second, Annabella Sciorra has a powerful cameo as DiNorscio's embittered ex-wife whose visit with her cheating ex-husband becomes a chain-smoking rite of passage for her.Finally, in his film debut, Broadway sensation Ra&uacute;l Esparza (Company) plays the key role of DiNorscio's greasy, drug-addicted cousin Tony Compagna with surprising relish. His character's desperate act opens the film, but it's the brief climactic cross-examination scene that finally brings the trial to life with Tony visibly breaking down under the weight of his betrayal to DiNorscio. I just wish the rest of the movie was as involving. The usually low-key British actor Linus Roache is a surprising choice to play Kierney, and he provides the necessary bombast but with a wavering accent. The rest of the casting is more typical with Alex Rocco playing head gangster Nick Calabrese and Ron Silver as the often exasperated presiding judge. Lumet unwisely uses musical cues to punctuate the action, though the music often overwhelms the dialogue to the point of distraction. The DVD comes with just one extra, ""Conversations with Sidney Lumet"", which has been inexplicably broken up into multiple parts despite the cursory nature of Lumet's comments in each section.",3,Diesel Flails Even with Lumet Back in the Courtroom But a Few Others Shine,1180742400,"06 2, 2007",2007,2980,"['ambitious', 'bid', 'credibility', 'serious', 'actor', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'hard', 'here', 'imposing', 'physical', 'stature', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'finesse', 'gravitas', 'carry', 'off', 'role', 'Jackie', 'DiNorscio', 'pivotal', 'member', 'true-life', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Lucchese', 'crime', 'family', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'court', '76', 'charges', 'various', 'crimes', 'resulted', 'longest', 'criminal', 'trial', 'U.S.', 'history', 'No', 'stranger', 'courtroom', '12', 'Angry', 'Men', 'Verdict', 'veteran', 'filmmaker', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'helmed', '2006', 'dramedy', 'prowess', 'evident', 'edges', 'film', 'relatively', 'lifeless', 'slog', 'exhausting', 'duration', 'trial', 'Lumet', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'T.J.', 'Mancini', 'Robert', 'J.', 'McCrea', 'think', 'story', 'compelling', 'enough', 'having', 'invest', 'much', 'terms', 'story', 'structure', 'production', 'out', 'be', 'key', 'error', 'judgment.The', 'problems', 'start', 'toupee-challenged', 'Diesel', 'who', 'be', 'left', 'out', 'dry', 'Lumet', 'lunk-headed', 'clownish', 'presence', 'DiNorscio', 'dilemma', 'less', 'palpable', 'refusing', 'plea', 'bargain', 'hyper-obsessed', 'federal', 'prosecutor', 'Sean', 'Kierney', 'DiNorscio', 'represent', 'court', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'more', 'outsized', 'personality', 'Diesel', 'emphasize', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'ploy', 'Fortunately', 'Lumet', 'still', 'idiosyncratic', 'sense', 'casting', 'many', 'other', 'roles', 'three', 'actors', 'stand', 'out', 'First', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'Station', 'Agent', 'becalming', 'authority', 'role', 'one', 'defense', 'attorneys', 'out', 'one', 'ally', 'DiNorscio', 'can', 'trust', 'dwarf', 'up', 'only', 'when', 'platform', 'wheeled', 'courtroom', 'provide', 'arguments', 'Second', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'powerful', 'cameo', 'DiNorscio', 'embittered', 'ex-wife', 'visit', 'cheating', 'ex-husband', 'becomes', 'chain-smoking', 'rite', 'passage', 'her.Finally', 'film', 'debut', 'Broadway', 'sensation', 'Ra', 'uacute', 'Esparza', 'Company', 'key', 'role', 'DiNorscio', 'greasy', 'drug-addicted', 'cousin', 'Tony', 'Compagna', 'surprising', 'relish', 'character', 'desperate', 'act', 'film', 'brief', 'climactic', 'cross-examination', 'scene', 'finally', 'trial', 'life', 'Tony', 'visibly', 'breaking', 'down', 'weight', 'betrayal', 'DiNorscio', 'just', 'wish', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'involving', 'usually', 'low-key', 'British', 'actor', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'surprising', 'choice', 'play', 'Kierney', 'necessary', 'bombast', 'wavering', 'accent', 'rest', 'casting', 'more', 'typical', 'Alex', 'Rocco', 'playing', 'head', 'gangster', 'Nick', 'Calabrese', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'often', 'exasperated', 'presiding', 'judge', 'Lumet', 'unwisely', 'musical', 'cues', 'punctuate', 'action', 'music', 'often', 'dialogue', 'point', 'distraction', 'DVD', 'just', 'one', 'extra', 'Conversations', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'been', 'inexplicably', 'broken', 'up', 'multiple', 'parts', 'cursory', 'nature', 'Lumet', 'comments', 'section']",N/A

Jackie's fanatic devotion to the pledge never to rat on family or friends is put to the test in a case against several Mafioso characters.  The trial is presided over by Judge Finestein (a superb Ron Silver) with prosecuting attorney Sean Kierney (Linus Roache in a strong departure from his usual screen characters) and among the defense attorneys is the lead attorney Ben Klandis (Peter Dinklage, once again proving he is a powerhouse of an actor).  Jackie acts as his own attorney and this is the joy of the film: watching a good fella with a sixth grade education rely on his intuition and charisma with the jury to bring down a verdict thought impossible is not only a delight to see as a role for Diesel, but gains a respect for a character who at the outset seems far from deserving of same.  The supporting roles include the consisitently fine Annabella Sciora as Jackie's ex-wife, Alex Rocco as the acerbic despicable Nick Calabrese, Raul Esparza as the perpetrator of the gunshots and the smarmy FBI rat witness against Jackie, and so many more.In a film of this caliber it is odd that the sound editor did not have the courtesy to filter out the ambient courtroom noise that at times buries much of the softer, and very poignant dialogue.  While we are in the courtroom (which is the major part of the film) the noise from the air conditioning, or camera gear or whatever just rumbles along intrusively.  But even that technical faux pas doesn't diminish the work of Sidney Lumet nor dim the fine performance by Vin Diesel, complete with prosthetic additions to his body to make him appear more like the real life 'Fat Jack' than the hunks Diesel usually plays!

Loosely based with a legimate situation, locale, and a few familiar names popped off here and there. It does'nt matter. It could be pure fiction. Another well-crafted film by the old master Sidney Lumet who 50 years ago gave us ""12 Angry Men"" and now returns to the courtroom in grand style.The set design and cinematography reflect a bright new approach to what we would normally expect of a trial saga. The editing is tight and flows superbly along with great attention to viewre comprehension.Vin Diesel runs the show and displays a variety of emotions that pay tribute to him as an actor with a great script. Ron Silver, probably one of the most versatile actors today, has a field day as the veteran judge trying to cope under a love-hate relationship with Mr. Diesel.

Diesel is funny and startlingly poignant as the main character, an unrepentant mobster who refuses to testify against his ""boys,"" even when they hate him.  Linus Roche(aka Thomas Wayne fromBatman Begins) is great as the federal prosecutor, Peter Dinkladge brings his usual awesomeness as another defense attorney, and Ron Silver is stern but warm as the judge determined that everyone will get a fair trial.  According to the movie most of the courtroom dialogue is direct lift from the transcripts of an actual mob trial, so the screenwriters got off easy in some ways, but it is written well enough to give us a bit of sympathy for Diesel's character.  His boys, good or bad, love'em or hate'em, are all he has and if he turns on them he truly has nothing.  The movie did surprise me by looking so low budget, obviously shot on lower end digital video cameras, but the movie isn't there to look flashy.

While the premise sounds dated, it's in the hands of legendary director Sidney Lumet (who directed 'Dog Day Afternoon' one of my favorite films). It also stars Vin Diesel in a surprising turn, not just because he has hair, as Jackie DiNorscio. When we meet Jackie, he's asleep in his bedroom; When his cousin comes in and shoots him. At the hospital, Jackie claims he doesn't know who it was. This is used to get the point across that Jackie is no rat. Anyway, Jackie returns to his lifestyle and is promptly arrested for drug charges; He's then sentenced to 30 years in prison. While sitting in jail, he learns that twenty members of the Lucchese crime family have been arrested and the prosecutor's office, led by the unlikeable Sean Kierney (Linus Roache), are offering Jackie a reduced sentence for him to testify. The offer is in typical movie fashion; Bring him in from jail to a nice office, ask him some questions about his day, give him good food, and then take it away. Jackie turns the offer down and heads to court, where he decides to defend himself. Problem is, Jackie's no lawyer and his knowledge of law is limited only to the number of times he's been arrested. The courtroom movie thing has been done countless times before; Some of the movies just take place in the courtroom half the time, others the whole time. This one is, essentially, the latter...And it works. It's a true story and most of the court stuff is actual testimony. Even though you know that every one of the men in the courtroom are guilty, you still find yourself rooting for them. Vin Diesel easily gives his best performance and the most joyous performance of the year. Peter Dinklage ('Elf') is also great as a lawyer who's also involved in the trial. This movie is very funny, very entertaining...It's really just pure entertainment all the way. Once again director Lumet shows his talent for keeping the audience entertained in one spot (DDA took place at a bank). This is a great movie, don't miss it.GRADE: A",5,Find Me Guilty,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,2121,"['Find', 'Me', 'Guilty', 'true', 'story', 'court', 'case', 'involving', 'mob', 'one', 'mobster', 'who', 'decided', 'defend', 'premise', 'dated', 'hands', 'legendary', 'director', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'who', 'directed', ""'Dog"", 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'also', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'surprising', 'turn', 'not', 'just', 'hair', 'Jackie', 'DiNorscio', 'When', 'meet', 'Jackie', 'asleep', 'bedroom', 'When', 'cousin', 'shoots', 'hospital', 'Jackie', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'was', 'used', 'get', 'point', 'Jackie', 'rat', 'Anyway', 'Jackie', 'lifestyle', 'promptly', 'arrested', 'drug', 'charges', 'then', 'sentenced', '30', 'years', 'prison', 'sitting', 'jail', 'twenty', 'members', 'Lucchese', 'crime', 'family', 'have', 'been', 'arrested', 'prosecutor', 'office', 'led', 'unlikeable', 'Sean', 'Kierney', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'are', 'offering', 'Jackie', 'reduced', 'sentence', 'testify', 'offer', 'typical', 'movie', 'fashion', 'Bring', 'jail', 'nice', 'office', 'ask', 'questions', 'day', 'give', 'good', 'food', 'then', 'take', 'away', 'Jackie', 'offer', 'down', 'heads', 'court', 'where', 'defend', 'Problem', 'Jackie', 'lawyer', 'knowledge', 'law', 'limited', 'only', 'number', 'times', 'been', 'arrested', 'courtroom', 'movie', 'thing', 'been', 'done', 'countless', 'times', 'movies', 'just', 'take', 'place', 'courtroom', 'time', 'others', 'whole', 'time', 'one', 'essentially', 'latter', 'true', 'story', 'most', 'court', 'stuff', 'actual', 'testimony', 'Even', 'know', 'one', 'men', 'courtroom', 'are', 'guilty', 'still', 'find', 'rooting', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'easily', 'best', 'performance', 'most', 'joyous', 'performance', 'year', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', ""'Elf"", 'also', 'great', 'lawyer', 'who', 'also', 'involved', 'trial', 'movie', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'entertaining', 'really', 'just', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'way', 'Once', 'again', 'director', 'Lumet', 'talent', 'keeping', 'audience', 'entertained', 'one', 'spot', 'DDA', 'took', 'place', 'bank', 'great', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'it.GRADE']",N/A

Jack DiNorscio decided to defend himself in what is known as the longest criminal trial in United States history. The film is basically a chronicle of the most noteworthy days of testimony of the trail. The script was based on actual courtroom dialogue so it's interesting to see what actually happened. The film is basically a one man show, and Vin Diesel steals the show as Jack. The entire film is held together by his performance, and it is a fine one at that. As for the film, there really isn't much but testimony after testimony after testimony. In fact, it actually gets a tad bit boring at some parts. I also found the film a little bit unsatisfying at the end. I mean, this is a mobster, a man who is involved in lots of illegal activities and the movie makes him a likeable character. The audience laughs at his jokes, feels his sorrow, and feels his joy. This killer becomes a loveable character and is the star of the movie, but what is the point? Okay, he defended himself in court, he is a mobster, he has a grand personality. You get to a point and say, what was the point of the movie? I mean, it has no message, no real meaningful social commentary, nothing that states that this movie needed to be made. Yeah, the guy states his case and his opinion on things but that still doesn't change the fact that he is a crook. It's a performance piece, but it's a lot of fun to watch.ACTING: Vin Diesel with hair is pretty interesting to watch. He gives a solid and believable performance as Jack. He gives his character charm and an edge that the audience can really relate to. Peter Dinklage also give a very fine performance, you may remember him as the ""elf"" who drop-kicks Will Ferrel in Elf. He also starred in The Station Agent. His solid performance in the film was amazing to watch, he's a great actor but it's too bad he can't really find good roles being a dwarf. Acting carries this movie, nothing else.BOTTOM LINE: If you want to see some great acting and listen to some great dialogue then this movie is a treat. You won't want to see it twice because of its slow pace, but it's a good movie to see on a friday night.

988795,A2T049UQONS0OY,B000FFJ826,Larry VanDeSande,"[10, 13]","Fans of ""The Sopranos"", ""Goodfellas"", Mafia and courtroom flicks will enjoy this fact-based (but probably not completely factual) look at the lengthiest RICO trail in American history starring Vin Diesel and directed by octogenarian Sidney Lumet.Diesel plays New Jersey mobster Jack DiNorscio defending himself in the longest Mafia trial in U.S. history. Diesel is effective in the role as a disruptive force in judge Ron Silver's court. Alex Rocco, a Mafioso going back to ""The Godfather"" and through roles he played in TV's ""Kojak"", is the ring leader in the trial and the main guy the feds are after. Why DiNorscio became the focus of this movie is a question looking for an answer.In any event, the courtroom ""drama"" is unlike most of what you see in this kind of movie. Diesel's character is uneducated, has little or no knowledge of courtroom requirements or decorum, and shows these shortcomings regularly through his inappropriate and often unbearable behavior as a litigator.The other gangsters on trial turn against him after they come to view him as a force out for himself. Prosecutors too see him as a hazard insofar as his comedy act seems to appeal to jurors. True or not, you've probably never seen an attorney ask these kind of questions in court!Ironically, the film lionizes DiNorscio as a heroic figure that carries out the Mafia credo of not ratting out a brother. Throughout the film he protests his love for his Cosa Nostra brethren, even when they are working against him, and continually states his case against being a rat. This, to me, was the principal theme of the film -- that this lowlife gangster was somehow a hero. The outcome of the movie seems also to support that view.Several bit players from ""The Sopranos"", including Junior Soprano's lawyer and one of Tony Soprano's dead love interests, fill out the supporting cast in this New York production. This flick is probably at the level of ""The Valachi Papers"" but with a far different perspective. It has little of the sizzle of ""Goodfellas"" but is interesting in its courtroom scenes, where much of the script allegedly mimicked the real trial the went on for more than 500 days.So fans of gangster and courtroom flicks can cast aside any doubt and go for this movie, which is probably the best characterization Vin Diesel has put on so far. He deservedly wasn't nominated for any awards for this but it shows he can do a bit more than simply play Vin Diesel on screen.",3,3.5 stars for this effective Mafia courtroom dramedy,1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,2456,"['Fans', 'Sopranos', 'Goodfellas', 'Mafia', 'courtroom', 'flicks', 'will', 'enjoy', 'fact-based', 'probably', 'not', 'completely', 'factual', 'look', 'lengthiest', 'RICO', 'trail', 'American', 'history', 'starring', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'directed', 'octogenarian', 'Sidney', 'Lumet.Diesel', 'New', 'Jersey', 'mobster', 'Jack', 'DiNorscio', 'defending', 'longest', 'Mafia', 'trial', 'U.S.', 'history', 'Diesel', 'effective', 'role', 'disruptive', 'force', 'judge', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'court', 'Alex', 'Rocco', 'Mafioso', 'going', 'back', 'Godfather', 'roles', 'played', 'TV', 'Kojak', 'ring', 'leader', 'trial', 'main', 'guy', 'feds', 'are', 'Why', 'DiNorscio', 'became', 'focus', 'movie', 'question', 'looking', 'answer.In', 'event', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'most', 'what', 'see', 'kind', 'movie', 'Diesel', 'character', 'uneducated', 'little', 'knowledge', 'courtroom', 'requirements', 'decorum', 'shortcomings', 'regularly', 'inappropriate', 'often', 'unbearable', 'behavior', 'litigator.The', 'other', 'gangsters', 'trial', 'turn', 'come', 'view', 'force', 'out', 'Prosecutors', 'too', 'see', 'hazard', 'insofar', 'comedy', 'act', 'appeal', 'jurors', 'True', 'not', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'never', 'seen', 'attorney', 'ask', 'kind', 'questions', 'court', 'Ironically', 'film', 'DiNorscio', 'heroic', 'figure', 'out', 'Mafia', 'credo', 'not', 'ratting', 'out', 'brother', 'film', 'love', 'Cosa', 'Nostra', 'brethren', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'working', 'continually', 'case', 'being', 'rat', 'was', 'principal', 'theme', 'film', 'lowlife', 'gangster', 'was', 'somehow', 'hero', 'outcome', 'movie', 'also', 'support', 'view.Several', 'bit', 'players', 'Sopranos', 'including', 'Junior', 'Soprano', 'lawyer', 'one', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'dead', 'love', 'interests', 'fill', 'out', 'supporting', 'cast', 'New', 'York', 'production', 'flick', 'probably', 'level', 'Valachi', 'Papers', 'far', 'different', 'perspective', 'little', 'sizzle', 'Goodfellas', 'interesting', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'where', 'much', 'script', 'allegedly', 'mimicked', 'real', 'trial', 'went', 'more', '500', 'days.So', 'fans', 'gangster', 'courtroom', 'flicks', 'can', 'cast', 'aside', 'doubt', 'go', 'movie', 'probably', 'best', 'characterization', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'put', 'so', 'far', 'deservedly', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'awards', 'can', 'do', 'bit', 'more', 'simply', 'play', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'screen']",N/A
988796,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B000FFJ826,Mark,"[1, 1]","With atrocities like The Hills Have Eyes, Failure to Launch, and the Pink Panther littering the shelves DVD retail stores, I was extremely pleased to come upon Five-time Academy Award nominee Sidney Lumet's newest film.  In Find Me Guilty, Lumet has adapted actual dialogue from the Lucchese Family trial, a trial that still holds the record for the longest running trial in history (about 21 months).  Vin Diesel gives the best performance of his career as ""Jackie Dee"" DiNorscio, one of the multiple defendants in this monstrous case.  The film opens rather shakily, skipping time periods without warning, jumping quickly from the time Jackie is shot by his cousin, to the drug deal that gets him arrested, to his conviction, and finally to the case itself within a matter of fifteen or twenty minutes.  Jackie Dee is offered a deal from the federal government to have his thirty year drug sentence shortened if he will testify against the Lucchese family.  Jackie Dee, although having only a sixth grade education, is smarter than most people, and quickly recognizes that the government has given him the maximum sentence on purpose, to get him to testify against his employers.  Jackie violently refuses, and he is thrown into the pile of over twenty defendants in the case.  After firing his previous pickpocket lawyer, he decides that he is going to defend himself in the case.  The only one who actually believes that this could work is the undersized lawyer, Ben Klandis (Peter Dinklage).  Peter Dinklage is probably one of the most underrated actors of our time, pulling off strong roles like that of Klandis, and especially his character Finbar McBride in The Station Agent.  Jackie, like most street smart individuals, picks up on the duties of a lawer extremely quickly, and begins to win over the jury.  Jackie DiNorscio is truly a guilty man, but Lumet creates him as a warm, love-to-hate character that wins over the jury, as well as the hearts of the viewer.  We become part of Jackie's family and realize where his devotion lies.  Jackie does have a weakness, and that is his temper.  He repeatedly loses his temper in the wrong places and almost gets removed from the trial.  The relationship between Jackie Dee and his former boss, Nick Calabrese (Alex Rocco) is tense at first.  Nick believes that Jackie is doing this for show in order to get off of the charges and leave the rest of the family hanging.  The rest of the defendants give Jackie the silent treatment, but the viewer knows that Jackie's loyalty lies with his ""family.""  Lumet's film is careful to stick to the point and not wander off of the case, and most of the film takes place within the confines of either the courtroom or Jackie Dee's cell.  Vin Diesel and Peter Dinklage give two wonderful performances, and they, along with the insightful direction of Sidney Lumet, essentially carry the film and make it a success.

Based on a true story about the longest criminal trial in history, the movie admittedly tries to sanctify a group of mob members by making the prosecution look foolish, and maybe rightfully so, as the prosecution's case is so protracted and disorganized that the defendant's cache of lawyers makes it pretty obvious where the verdict will lie.  But if you don't find these criminals' victory distasteful, you can still enjoy the marvelous performances.

988799,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000FFJ826,mirasreviews,"[21, 22]","""Find Me Guilty"" is a comedic take on what was at the time the longest criminal trial in American history, the 1987-1988 trial of 20 members of the New Jersey Lucchese crime family on 76 charges under the RICO Act. Most of the courtroom testimony is taken from the real trial transcripts. The film focuses on Giacomo ""Jackie"" DiNorscio (Vin Diesel), called ""Fat Jack"" in real life, who, frustrated with his lawyer, insists on representing himself. Jackie is already serving a 30-year prison sentence for narcotics distribution, so the outcome of this trial is somewhat academic to him. Prosecutor Sean Kierney (Linus Roache) offers him a reduction in his current sentence in exchange for testimony at the RICO trial, but Jackie refuses to rat out his friends. Untrained in the law, Jackie's only defense is to make the jury like him more than they like the prosecutors. ""A laughing jury is never a hanging jury,"" says defense attorney Ben Klandis (Peter Dinklage). ""I'm not a gangster. I'm a gagster,"" says Jackie. And he puts on quite a show over the course of the 21-month trial.""Find Me Guilty"" does make light of Jackie's crimes, presenting him as a loyal, affable guy. It could hardly do otherwise, since Jackie made light of them, and he seems to have been a loyal, affable criminal. (Giacomo DiNorscio died while this movie was being filmed.) This obviously isn't a catalog of the Lucchese family's misdeeds. There were some very disreputable people on trial whose victims were not limited to their fellow Mafioso. ""Find Me Guilty"" is about Jackie's role in this long, remarkable trial. Vin Diesel does the best work of his career thus far. Perhaps due to his laconic, tough-guy image, Diesel can play Jackie's silliness, foolishness, and melodrama without the audience losing sight of his hoodlum toughness. He's a big presence that carries the film through courtroom testimony that might otherwise be tedious. DiNorscio is an interesting character, whose conviction that he must love his mob family, and they must love him, carried him through the trial and many years in prison. ""Find Me Guilty""'s comedic approach to courtroom and mafia dramas is new and entertaining.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): ""A Conversation with Sidney Lumet"" (5 min) is a series of snippets in which director Lumet talks about meeting the real Jackie DiNorscio, Jackie's motives, and authenticity in the film. There is a theatrical trailer (2  min) and 3 television spots for the film (30 sec. each), as well as a trailer for the 1992 movie ""My Cousin Vinny"" (1  min).

But every time I laughed, a frown crossed my face soon after.  I do not understand the logic in the no-snitch rule at all; one person wastes away their whole life so other folks who were equally wrong get to live their lives free as a bird.  I remember hearing a song by a new hip-hop group saying something to the effect of ""Don't do dumb s--- and nobody'll have to snitch."" That was basically my attitude through this whole movie.  I'm not a fan of cops, but I don't really root for the bad guys either.  It was interesting to hear the dialogue from the real trial, see Vin Diesel play a very convincing Italian character in full form Mafia stereotype, and some pretty interesting logic on the FBI and the cops.  It was educational to learn how witnesses were gathered, how descriptions were made (specifically the ""look Italian"" scene), and I loved it when Jack's wife reacted to one of the police officers.  The movie was basically about a guy who was trying to defend himself as a lawyer with no previous experience, and defend the rest of his ""friends,"" one of which belittled him the entire time.  Although I found the movie interesting, it was rather depressing to see that this is based on a real life story.  I have so many mixed feelings about the ""ratting"" rule to the point where I may not have enjoyed the comedy in its full form because I was too busy trying to analyze the case.

What did Sidney Lumet see that the rest of us couldn't? Was his performance in ""The Pacifier"" the key? Who's next? Ryan Reynolds?Based on a true story, ""Find Me Guilty"" is the story of Giacomo ""Fat Jack"" DiNorscio (Diesel), a mobster who gets arrested during a drug sting. The Feds use this as leverage to try to get DiNorscio to rat out the head of his `family', Nick Calabrese (Alex Rocco) and the rest of the lieutenants and made men in his mob family, men he has grown up with his entire life. DiNorscio holds his tongue. The District Attorney (Linus Roache) moves ahead with the RICO trial, the largest of its kind to date. DiNorscio decides to defend himself, despite the advice of Judge Finestein (Ron Silver) and Ben Klandis (Peter Dinklage, ""The Station Agent""), the attorney representing one of his friends. As the long trial progresses, DiNorscio frequently addresses the jury, telling them he's a `Gagster', not a Gangster. His defense is, if anything, unique.""Guilty"" depicts a series of key moments during this landmark trial, which took place in New York, over the course of almost two years. From the beginning of the trial, as we watch the defendants and their lawyers crowd around three large conference tables in the courtroom, to an increasingly desperate District Attorney (Linus Roache), we realize this trial will not be typical. Indeed, it lasts almost twice as long as originally predicted because the District Attorney calls dozens of witnesses and presents hundreds of pieces of evidence.But the key moments we watch all involve DiNorscio. He is our entry into this world. It is through his eyes we are to witness this trial, through his actions that we will experience the proceedings. To do this, we have to get to know and, to a certain extent, like DiNorscio. We have to at least understand him. The success of this depends on two people. Diesel and Lumet. Both are successful to a degree. Both let us down to a certain extent.This is Diesel's best performance yet. That's a mixed compliment. His previous work has all been about being an `Action Movie Star'. He hasn't spent a lot of time on screen building characters, making us care about real people. ""Guilty"" marks a departure for him. It is evident that he is trying very hard to actually make us believe he is DiNorscio. Adding a toupee and 30 pounds, Diesel looks like an out of shape mobster, but he doesn't really create a three-dimensional personality. We hear him say that he is a `gagster', not a `gangster' more than once, but we don't really understand why this is important to his character. Virtually the entire film takes place in the courtroom or his jail cell, so this allows little time for him to interact with his family or his friends. The brief moments he has with others are interesting; a scene between Diesel and Annabella Sciorra, who plays his ex-wife, is memorable. There is also a quick scene between Diesel and Rocco which helps to set-up the ongoing conflict. Yes, DiNorscio is jeopardizing the entire group, but Rocco's character makes a statement during this scene about never liking Diesel's character. Why? Why is DiNorscio so blind to this feeling? He thinks they are all fine and dandy. But he also has a daughter and she disappears for long stretches of time.Lumet is a great director, but he is a little off of his game here. A few early scenes help to establish a bit of Diesel's character in the outside world, but the majority of the film is about the trial, which means DiNorscio is either in a courtroom or in a jail cell. This cuts him off from the world; his daughter, his mother, his father, his ex-wife. It cuts him off from us. There is an extended bit about how DiNorscio needs an easy chair to sleep. It almost seems like an odd thing to include because it really has no bearing on the story, the lack of sleep doesn't seem to affect him or the trial. Lumet and his writers seem so intent on depicting various parts of the trial that any part of the outside life of these characters is pushed aside.When we only focus on the court trial, we have to be pretty mesmerized by the proceedings. Frankly, the whole point of watching the proceedings seems to be to make us like DiNorscio, to watch him joke around and attempt to worm his way out of the situation. It works for a while, but when this becomes the sole reason for the film, it is a let down. We need more substance from the outside world to give the court scenes more resonance and because the court scenes aren't memorable, we are left with watching a theatrical exercise.""Guilty"" suffers greatly from a lack of outside influence. We don't see enough of his outside life, or learn enough about who he is to make the story interesting or memorable.The one thing we take from ""Guilty"" is that Diesel may actually become a good actor, under the guidance of the right directors.",3,"Wait.

It wasn't a BAD movie, definitely, but it was definitely not a GOOD movie by any stretch of the imagination. Vin Diesel was good and so was Peter Dinklage.

The movie draws out (much like the trial) and you can't really see a connection with anything. They might as well have just made this an A & E special if they just wanted to highlight some funny things that Jackie DeNorsio said in his trial... but this definitely isn't worthy of a 2 hour movie.The directing is pretty boring which doesn't help the movie progress.
