876853,A3RPIWCD656PMH,B0007514BW,Gypsy82,"[57, 58]","Overall, I would say that this workout is intermediate to advanced.  I have about 12 different Tae Bo/Billy workouts that I rotate on a regular basis and compared to the others, I don't work up much of a sweat doing this workout.One thing I don't like about this workout is there is only about 10 mintues at the end of good cardio.  The rest of the workout consists of using the Billy Bands, mostly for arms. However, this is probably one of the better workouts for arms. Also, except for the last 10 mintues, there is not alot of kick sequences.Billy also does some complicated combination moves near the end of the workout.  Until you get the hang of these moves, you will waste time trying to figure out what is going on and trying to follow Billy.I'm a big fan of the Billy Bands, but compared to the other workouts that use the bands, this workout is not as intensive cardio-wise.  If you really want a good workout with the bands and a good workout cardio-wise I would suggest Ultimate Bootcamp, Cardio Bootcamp or Boot Camp 2.  If you just want a very intensive cardio workout, I suggest the Get Ripped Advanced workouts.Overall, I rated this workout a 3 just because of the low amount of leg work and and low amount of good cardio.  Don't get me wrong, this workout will get your heartrate up and keep it up, but I just don't feel that I have ""really"" worked out after doing this.",3,Good workout but not as cardio intensive as other Billy workouts,1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,1388,"['Overall', 'would', 'say', 'workout', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'have', 'about', '12', 'different', 'Tae', 'Bo/Billy', 'rotate', 'regular', 'basis', 'compared', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'up', 'much', 'sweat', 'doing', 'workout.One', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'workout', 'only', 'about', '10', 'mintues', 'end', 'good', 'cardio', 'rest', 'workout', 'using', 'Billy', 'Bands', 'mostly', 'arms', 'However', 'probably', 'one', 'better', 'workouts', 'arms', 'Also', 'last', '10', 'mintues', 'not', 'alot', 'kick', 'sequences.Billy', 'also', 'complicated', 'combination', 'moves', 'end', 'workout', 'get', 'hang', 'moves', 'will', 'waste', 'time', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'trying', 'follow', 'Billy.I', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Billy', 'Bands', 'compared', 'other', 'workouts', 'use', 'bands', 'workout', 'not', 'intensive', 'cardio-wise', 'really', 'want', 'good', 'workout', 'bands', 'good', 'workout', 'cardio-wise', 'would', 'suggest', 'Ultimate', 'Bootcamp', 'Cardio', 'Bootcamp', 'Boot', 'Camp', '2', 'just', 'want', 'very', 'intensive', 'cardio', 'workout', 'suggest', 'Get', 'Ripped', 'Advanced', 'workouts.Overall', 'rated', 'workout', '3', 'just', 'low', 'amount', 'leg', 'work', 'low', 'amount', 'good', 'cardio', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'workout', 'will', 'get', 'heartrate', 'up', 'keep', 'up', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'have', 'really', 'worked', 'out', 'doing']",N/A
876854,A36PYL1X0N2HBX,B0007514BW,JHH,"[6, 8]","This is my first Billy Blanks video and will be my last.  First and foremost, nowhere on the DVD description does it mention that the bands are VERY NECESSARY for a full workout.  I work out a lot so not having these bands made this video easy.  Certainly I was able to substitute some with free weights, but I think the packaging needs to emphasize ""BANDS NECESSARY FOR MAXIMAL WORKOUT.""Second, this video seem to be put together very haphazardly.  I don't mind low budget videos, but I mind if the work out is NOT edited!!  At one point, Billy stops to tie his shoes - really??  Then he was about to go into a cardio exercise when the music for the cool down started.  Sometimes he would start off on the wrong foot as his exercisers in the back!!  Turn around Billy!!Third, he does not keep count.  There is a disproportionate amount of exercises in the video where one side is worked-out twice as much as the other.  There was also one leg exercise where the opposite side was completely ignored!Fourth, Billy is a horrible teacher.  He does not really go into forms, and he seems to ignore it.  The only thing I got from the video is ""thumbs up"" when punching.  I noticed a lot of exercisers that probably should not be using his bands since their forms were really suffering.  That is NOT a way to film a work out video.  Compromising your form can result in injuries.Lastly, this video has a strange feeling of a cult.  Maybe it's suppose to be militaristic, but the exercisers were a bit too zealous for me.With Billy being this famous, I sure hope his other videos were better.",2,Somewhat misleading...,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,1586,"['first', 'Billy', 'Blanks', 'video', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'First', 'foremost', 'nowhere', 'DVD', 'description', 'mention', 'bands', 'are', 'VERY', 'NECESSARY', 'full', 'workout', 'work', 'out', 'lot', 'not', 'having', 'bands', 'made', 'video', 'easy', 'Certainly', 'was', 'able', 'substitute', 'free', 'weights', 'think', 'packaging', 'emphasize', 'BANDS', 'NECESSARY', 'FOR', 'MAXIMAL', 'WORKOUT', 'Second', 'video', 'seem', 'be', 'put', 'together', 'very', 'haphazardly', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'low', 'budget', 'videos', 'mind', 'work', 'out', 'NOT', 'edited', 'one', 'point', 'Billy', 'tie', 'shoes', 'really', 'Then', 'was', 'about', 'go', 'cardio', 'exercise', 'when', 'music', 'cool', 'down', 'started', 'Sometimes', 'would', 'start', 'off', 'wrong', 'foot', 'exercisers', 'back', 'Turn', 'around', 'Billy', 'Third', 'not', 'keep', 'count', 'disproportionate', 'amount', 'exercises', 'video', 'where', 'one', 'side', 'worked-out', 'twice', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'leg', 'exercise', 'where', 'opposite', 'side', 'was', 'completely', 'ignored', 'Fourth', 'Billy', 'horrible', 'teacher', 'not', 'really', 'go', 'forms', 'ignore', 'only', 'thing', 'got', 'video', 'thumbs', 'up', 'when', 'punching', 'noticed', 'lot', 'exercisers', 'probably', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'using', 'bands', 'forms', 'were', 'really', 'suffering', 'NOT', 'way', 'film', 'work', 'out', 'video', 'Compromising', 'form', 'can', 'result', 'injuries.Lastly', 'video', 'strange', 'feeling', 'cult', 'suppose', 'be', 'militaristic', 'exercisers', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'zealous', 'me.With', 'Billy', 'being', 'famous', 'sure', 'hope', 'other', 'videos', 'were', 'better']",N/A

876856,A35FRNCTOQ2WMD,B0007514BW,K. Weirich,"[6, 6]","Total Body Fat Blaster is a really intense workout.  I have both this one and Fat Blasting Cardio.  Even though Fat Blasting Cardio is good, I really find this one to be a lot better.  It's not as intense in respect to cardio, but rather it deals with lots of resistance training with the bands.  Billy does some great outer thigh, quad and hamstring exercises with the bands.  There isn't a lot of kicking in the workout because this workout mainly focuses on arms.  Let me just say, after taking off the bands, my arms felt like jelly!  The only reason why I gave this four instead of five is because I really found Shellie; his daughter, to be a little more annoying than usual.  Normally, I don't mind her at all, but with the all of the grunting and yelling during the workout it got on my nerves after awhile.

It's a strength training workout with some cardio built in and you'll need the bands to get anything from it. If you are looking for an intense cardio workout look elsewhere. I expected 'fat blasting' to mean advanced cardio and was disappointed. I hate standing still and doing bicep curls and tricep extensions when I could be sweating. You will get a good upper body workout, but it didn't make me sore like the Ultimate bootcamp did (essentially the same video with different moves).",3,not a cardio workout,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,563,"['First', 'off', 'video', 'waste', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Billy', 'strength', 'training', 'workout', 'cardio', 'built', ""'ll"", 'need', 'bands', 'get', 'anything', 'are', 'looking', 'intense', 'cardio', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'expected', ""'fat"", 'blasting', 'mean', 'advanced', 'cardio', 'was', 'disappointed', 'hate', 'standing', 'still', 'doing', 'bicep', 'curls', 'tricep', 'extensions', 'when', 'could', 'be', 'sweating', 'will', 'get', 'good', 'upper', 'body', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sore', 'Ultimate', 'bootcamp', 'did', 'essentially', 'same', 'video', 'different', 'moves']",N/A
