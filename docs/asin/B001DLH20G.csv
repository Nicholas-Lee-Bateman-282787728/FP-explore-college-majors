1182039,ADIV9VTAY9Z7H,B001DLH20G,CD Maniac,"[0, 0]","I really enjoyed this movie, but be warned:  this is not a feel-good piece of Christmas fluff that everyone is used to seeing during the holiday season.  Christmas is only the backdrop upon which the family conflict is played out.  Having said that, however, a lot of families do go through major dramas during the holiday, so it is very believable that this can and does happen.This movie can be viewed a a ""dark"" comedy, I suppose--and there are very funny moments:  the mom being way over the top on Christmas decorations; the grown kids behaving as children; the bewildered fiance who stumbles into the situation.  This is a very specific kind of comedy that some people do enjoy--if that's what you are expecting.  However, other people don't appreciate this kind of humor (especially if you are expecting sweeter fare).  So, just be aware of what you are getting into.Having said all that, I really enjoyed it.  It was nice to get a break from more sappy Christmas TV movies (although I love some of those, too).  And the acting, all around, is superb, especially from the parents:  David Ogden Stiers and Julia Duffy.  They handle the comedic moments with ease and then are able to shift into the heavy drama just as quickly.And, the ending of the movie is quite hopeful.",4,Christmas as a backdrop for family drama,1321056000,"11 12, 2011",2011,1278,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'be', 'warned', 'not', 'feel-good', 'piece', 'Christmas', 'fluff', 'everyone', 'used', 'seeing', 'holiday', 'season', 'Christmas', 'only', 'backdrop', 'family', 'conflict', 'played', 'out', 'Having', 'said', 'however', 'lot', 'families', 'do', 'go', 'major', 'dramas', 'holiday', 'very', 'believable', 'can', 'happen.This', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'dark', 'comedy', 'suppose', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'mom', 'being', 'way', 'top', 'Christmas', 'decorations', 'grown', 'kids', 'behaving', 'children', 'bewildered', 'fiance', 'who', 'situation', 'very', 'specific', 'kind', 'comedy', 'people', 'do', 'enjoy', 'what', 'are', 'expecting', 'However', 'other', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'kind', 'humor', 'especially', 'are', 'expecting', 'sweeter', 'fare', 'So', 'just', 'be', 'aware', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'into.Having', 'said', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'nice', 'get', 'break', 'more', 'sappy', 'Christmas', 'TV', 'movies', 'love', 'too', 'acting', 'superb', 'especially', 'parents', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'Julia', 'Duffy', 'handle', 'comedic', 'moments', 'ease', 'then', 'are', 'able', 'shift', 'heavy', 'drama', 'just', 'quickly.And', 'ending', 'movie', 'quite', 'hopeful']",Together Again for the First Time

The story of a controlling and manipulative  mom, Julia Duffy with 2 sons, and a dad David Ogden Stiers with 3 daughters and for both this is the second marriage. Son Roger is the comedian who can't stand his new sister who is a spoiled princess.  All the &#34;children&#34; are grown up or late teens. Great performances and lots of heart strings being pulled. A few secrets emerge in this first get together in 8 years.
