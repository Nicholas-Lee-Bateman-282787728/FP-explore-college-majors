I finally got a copy today, really against my better judgement, but it was cheap (at a store that shall remain nameless) and two discs so I hoped against hope that it'd be a decent deal. Man, was I wrong! If I knew it'd be this bad you couldn't have GIVEN it to me! I expected it to be low budget but jeez, they must've only used about $100 worth of videotape, instead of using film. The 1996 original was the worst in all respects but at least the sequel kinda had a couple of funny jokes. Still, it'd cut back and forth between being on videotape and digital tape, I guess it was. In both films the stripping was so boring that I'd fast forward through it, but at least the dancers were pretty decent looking for the most part. The acting in both films was atrocious, as were the stupidest, phoniest fight scenes ever, and who the hell was in charge of the sucky music? What was up with that? I know that their budget either didn't allow for using at least some popular music, or else they weren't given permission to, I guess, but the songs (which were all vampire-themed, of course) were just soooo bad, musically.BTW, is it just me or did anyone else notice the similarity between the ex-priest actor and his chubby friend with long dark hair and full facial hair, Larry, and Kevin Smith and his goateed friend in ""Clerks""? Coincidence? You be the judge.Anyway, if you like fake breasts (though there were some real ones, too), atrocious acting, phony fight scene, gahdawful music and Z-budget films then by all means get this DVD set.
