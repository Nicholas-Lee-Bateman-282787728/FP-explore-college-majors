1242707,A1VZOI54BXGA78,B001V32TTA,Born to Read,"[7, 8]","This is an amazing DVD - an American-made film about World War II (based on a novel by Erich Maria Remarque) in which all the characters are German and Americans are never mentioned - and the DVD is Korean-produced.  But what a moving film it is: a Wehrmacht soldier on the Russian front, disgusted by the brutality of war, returns on furlough to his home-town in Germany to find it practically destroyed.  He locates the pile of rubble that used to be his parents' home, but cannot locate his parents.  As he searches for them, he finds a young woman whose outspoken father is now languishing in a prison camp and who, herself, has been pushed into one small room of the family home to make way for others who have been bombed out of theirs.  One of her housemates is an officious harridan who makes it her business to spy on, and report, any perceived criticism against the Nazi regime.  Naturally, even as bombs rain down upon the soldier and the girl, they fall in love.  But it is a bittersweet affair, because dangling above their heads like the sword of Damocles is the end of his furlough.  And probable death on the Russian front.Remarque, whose books were banned by the Nazis, must certainly have watched the war from the safety of his home in the United States with immense disquietude.  His sympathy for what his former countrymen were enduring comes across movingly in `A Time to Love and a Time to Die,' as does his revulsion of small-minded people who have been handed great power, like the harridan in the girl's home: Remarque's sister was beheaded during the war after an accusation was made that she caused low morale for having voiced the opinion that Germany could not win the war.John Gavin plays the soldier and Keenan Wynn has a bit role, but all the other actors were unknown to me; Remarque has a small part, as well.  The film, made in 1958, has the inevitable whiff of the fifties, but that did not stand in the way of my enjoyment of it.  And while all the writing on the back of the box is in Korean, the actors speak English and the Korean subtitles can be removed.In the crowded annals of World War II films, `A Time to Love and a Time to Die' occupies a niche all of its own, and one no less interesting, exciting, or moving than the others.

This is an incredible war movie which tells the story of a young German soldier (John Gavin) who must deal with the horrors of war while the Russians are knocking at the front door of the Third Reich.  The German soldier willingly participates in the brutalities committed against his enemy while fighting an internal battle that all he has been taught is morally wrong.  He sees his home town and own family destroyed by war and begins to question its worth.  I wont go into how it ends but it is pretty climatic.  This movie was made before my time but If you ever saw Gavin in his small part in Psycho, then you know just how good an actor he was.

1242711,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B001V32TTA,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","This is a surprisingly intelligent and brilliant adaptation of a great novel written in 1954 by German writer Erich Maria Remarque (mostly known for his master piece ""All quiet on the Western Front"").Except a mistake on my part ""A time to love and a time to die"" was the first big Hollywood production showing the World War II from German point of view, and even if Remarque was a declared anti-Nazi (he was a wanted man in the Third Reich and spend all the period of 1933-45 as a refugee in Switzerland), making this film in 1958 was a pretty courageous thing.An important thing to know before watching this most excellent film is that IT IS NOT a war movie. The story happens of course integrally during World War II, in 1944, and yes, there are some scenes from Eastern Front at the beginning and at the end of the film, but other than one big artillery barrage falling on German soldiers no actual fighting is showed. German soldiers march a lot in the mud and talk a lot about war and life in general, but the only shots they fire are directed against defenseless Russian civilians they execute ""just in case"" if they are partisans...This film describes mostly the story of one soldier, private Ernst Graeber (John Gavin), who in the spring of 1944 receives his first leave in two years. Most of the film describes the eventful three weeks he spends in the town where he was born. However, although not a big city, this place is now regularly raided by allied bombers, targeting local industries, but slowly flattening the whole town in the process. When looking for his parents, Graeber meets a girl, Elisabeth Kruse (extraordinary German actress Liselotte Pulver), whom he knew once when they were together in the same class in high school. They never were friends before and in fact they hardly ever spoke one to another when in school - but since then they both changed a lot and the world around them changed even more, and they are both terribly lonely... I will say no more here - you deserve to discover this beautiful film by yourself.Now, even if there is no fighting, this film is very dramatic and really keeps the viewer on the edge, because life in Germany in 1944 is incredibly dangerous. Daily bomber raids are a constant element in everybody's life, to such a point that some soldiers actually shorten their leaves and go back to the Eastern Front(!) because there at least they can shoot back at those who try to kill them... But an even greater threat is the omnipresent shadow of the Gestapo. People must all the time watch carefully their language as every careless word can make a difference between living another day and being send to the concentration camp or even simply executed.This permanent state of fear at every moment of life (which affects even the Nazis themselves...) is possibly the strongest element of this film and it is a high achievement for a Hollywoodian production. Possibly the most terrifying moment of the film is a simple administrative visit in the Gestapo building, where a little, ugly and weird subaltern officer (played by Klaus Kinski in one of his first roles) just asks to fill some papers... Other than the excellent quality of the original story this excellent description of the omnipresent fear was mostly made possible by the fact that the director, Douglas Sirk, who was half-Danish half-German, personally experienced between 1933 and 1937 life in the Third Reich (he escaped to USA in 1937 to save his Jewish wife from death). I do not think I ever saw any of Douglas Sirk's other films, but he certainly impressed me with this one...Although the love story is very beautiful and Liselotte Pulver is a delight to watch, this is definitely not a ""feel good"" film. It is in fact a pretty terrifying thing to watch, as other than the peripeties of the heroes, what it shows is a society which put itself in such a tight corner that there is virtually no way out. And even if people begin to do the right things again, it may be already too late to save them from death - although may be not from eternal damnation, as a certain professor Pohlmann (played by Erich Maria Remarque himself) suggests it to Graeber in their most important discussion...Bottom line, this is an EXCELLENT film, to discover and watch absolutely and then to conserve preciously to watch it one day with your children (once they are big enough). I can not really say that I enjoyed it, but it certainly impressed me and made me think a lot.",5,"""You smile? You should scream!""
