Kuhn,"[17, 20]","After hearing that the legendary Anthony Wong would be playing the Wing Chun master in this latest installment of the Ip Man saga certainly got my attention. Sadly this dvd lacks anything to be excited about. The subtitles are very bad, at times completely out of sync and incorrect. The music sounds like it was taken from a low budget Hollywood musical and the overly choreographed fight scenes have the same sound effects as the old Bruce Lee movies where someone is hitting a Naugahyde couch with a bat. The editing is crude and seemingly random, and there is little to no continuity to the story. Anthony Wong is always great and he has Ip Man's characteristics down, but his subtleties are overshadowed by the poor direction of this film.

It was more about Ip Man the person than a fight movie, which makes it stand out from the other films on this subject.  It gives athe viewer a glimpse into the person rather than the fighter.

There is some action for those expecting it, and it's done nicely, though it should be pointed out to those expecting a fight movie, this isn't one.

Yes, there are the incredible fight scenes of Kung Fu/Wing Chun martial arts, but THIS Ip Man has depth of soul and feeling that hasn't really been shown in the previous series.

1659974,A16CRMFF3M599G,B00DOFGEV2,D E S T R O Y E R 2037,"[0, 0]","Well, if your like me then you watched IP MAN and then IP MAN 2 with Donnie. Then you decided to look for more films and came across this one. I read reviews first because, well in this day and age its safer. So I was prepared for a slower/less action film but I can understand those who werent prepared not liking it. With that being said, its a great film either way you look at it. Its by a different company and different lead actor playing IP MAN but really fits the part well. I was impressed how much the lead seemed to take over the same character style as the other two films. Going in to this movie you have to know that IP MAN is older so he isnt going to be as fast as the other films. You also have to know this film aims more towards how IP MAN handles life in general at an older age. And the struggles that come along with being older.The film has enough fight scenes to keep it moving along, just when it gets slow some kind of  fight breaks out to carry it along. I read another review knocking the last fight scene which isnt correct. If you watch the whole film you will really enjoy the last fight scene. It had a classic feel to it and I enjoyed it just as much as the other films. The only reason I give it 4/5 is because the subtitles were really really fast. Not through the entire film but certain areas I had to keep going back to replay what was said. I have watched many subtitle films and this one was just paced too fast in certain parts.

1659976,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00DOFGEV2,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","IP MAN: THE FINAL FIGHT (Orig. title ""Yip Man: Jung gik yat jin"" (""IP MAN: THE MASTER'S FINALE""), a/k/a IP MAN 4, a/k/a IP MAN 4: THE FINAL FIGHT, Dir. Herman Yau, 2013, 102 minutes, Cantonese with English subtitles). ~ Firstly, please note this film is a remake ofIp Man 2but don't allow that to put you off ... please!When I first reviewed this excellent film, I was a bit tough on it. That was careless. This film deserves multiple viewings and is truly an Oscar-worthy film. That cannot be said for two of the other three Ip Man films--though I think the original Donnie Yen version is also deserving of a golden guy. (Also I think IP MAN 0 was approved by the Wing Chun Association since its real-life director has a starring role in that film.)In this version it almost seems as if the Wing Chun students and even the Association wanted a better, more accurate film portraying Master Ip as a true human being and not stiff-as-a-board Donnie Yen.The amazing Anthony Wong Chau Sang (a/k/a Anthony Wong, a/k/a Anthony Perry), a perennial favorite of mine not least because I resemble him, hands in a spectacular performance in the title role. Wong is powerful in his stillness and skilled beyond most actors working today. His extremely beautiful smile and velvety voice really make you feel you're watching Master Ip, even though Wong bears little resemblance to Master Ip.Like I said, Wong looks like me--and I am not surprised, since I am 1/8 Chinese and Wong is 1/2 but doesn't look it.Wong, a six-footer whose birth name is Anthony Perry, was born and raised in Hong Kong. In spite of having an English father (sometimes claimed to be an Australian) and an obviously Caucasian appearance resembling Anthony Quinn, Wong has played some venomous, villainous weirdoes.Westerners will recognize him only vaguely because here he is older than I remember him. As many do, I recall him as a slender, black-haired musician--one of his many talents. Wong loves to work with Director Yau, who also directedIp Man 3 ""The Legend Is Born"" 2010(see my review).With little effort, he has given genuine onscreen life to the enigmatic Master Ip. This film runs its course from around 1950 until approximately 1969--it is not only the year 1950 as has been inaccurately stated over and over. This starts with Master Ip arriving in Hong Kong, and if you know IP MAN 2, then you already know the basic story outline. Only this version is better--and seems utterly unrelated to the production company of the original two films.It must be pointed out, this film is absolutely the best of the lot as a Ip Man biography. Anthony Wong breathes powerful life into this flawed, ordinary human who happened to be a grandmaster. We see Master Ip with his wife--whom he adored--and we see him later, collapsing in the street from the shock of her death.We see him fall in love with a pretty young girl who may be a prostitute (it is hinted but never addressed). We see him ill, lose his temper, lose a fight or two, we see him enjoying his food when his chronic stomach pain allowed him to.That is a well-rounded portrayal of a martial arts master (masters are only well-educated humans, not superhumans) and I defy anyone to name a film that does the job like this film--and Wong deserves an Oscar for best foreign actor, but I doubt we have an Oscar for that.Here, all is realism, no stylized nonsense or big-money cinematic shots (well, the swoop over Hong Kong at the beginning is cinematically 'big'). The classic shots are of Master Ip fighting or Master Ip teaching his beloved students. Though a few silly derailments make the film a bit boring at moments, I find it perfectly easy to cope. And may I say, this is pretty close to being a family film too.The bird's-eye view swooping-shot of 1949 Hong Kong and surrounding countryside looks funny because it is shot exactly as it was made: a table-top model. For all that it is a fascinating ""1980s HBO"" cityscape--but I LOVED the seamless way it honed in on the street in that one speedy swoop-shot, right onto Master Ip who is just arrived. After all the viewings, I still can't fathom how they did that so seamlessly: from a table-top model to the opening street scene.Take THAT, ya lousyMan of Tai Chi (Watch Now Before It's in Theaters)!Troubles with the film: the narration starts by Ip Ching, Master Ip's oldest son. However, he suddenly stops narrating and one of Master Ip's students takes over--the audience is unaware of this even though the narrators 'introduce' themselves (too subtly, I think).Two-thirds of the way in, the student abruptly goes silent and the narration is once again taken up by Ip Ching. The horrible subtitles don't help--but I would expect a better English dubbing with the DVD. Trouble here is the English dubbing is obviously performed by very young Chinese actors. The kid who dubs the voice for Anthony Perry sounds like he barely made it into college!And by the way, Master Ip's younger son Grandmaster Ip Chun, who also appears in this film (he was introduced as Grandmaster Leung Bik in IP MAN 0), is ignored totally in the story since he's away at college. Aside from poking fun at the whole martial arts genre, this is the film's way of apologizing for NOT having Grandmaster Ip Chun appear in it--but as I said, the real-life Grandmaster does make a cameo as Master Ip Man's landlord.You'll love this movie, especially if you recognize the remakes of every scene of IP MAN 2. The relationship this shows between Master Ip and Master Hong (subtitled as ""Master Ng"") is moving and lovely. As I said, the entire film concentrates on Master Ip's relationship to everyone, including a tense, bitter little reunion with Bruce Lee toward the end. I highly approve of this film's making: I'd been anticipating it since the last Ip Man film and was stunned to see Herman Yau would once again helm the direction.Well, here they did everyone proud. After Donnie Yen's second performance in IP MAN 2, I really thought that was going to be it. The whole thing made me ache to see a better overall film, and THIS IS IT! Watch for the major, tear-inducing surprise at the end of the film.Finally, as a companion I recommend you read the biography of Master Ip written by his son Ip Ching, who is portrayed so well in this film:Ip Man - Portrait of a Kung Fu Master(see my review). I hope Sister Wu Mei looks down upon this from Heaven with a smile.",5,"The final fight, the last gasp, but how I wish it weren't!

1659981,AR08EBGEEVE28,B00DOFGEV2,"Harold Holt ""Soulwriter""","[1, 2]","Let me begin by first saying that after reading the other reviews for this film on here, it sounds like the reviewers purchased very crappy copies of this film. I did not get my copy from AMAZON vendors, I purchased it at this year's Comic-Con, so I did not experience the bad-quality sound effects and poor subtitle techniques that the other reviewers describe. Having said that, onward to the film.IP MAN: The Final Fight was fun to watch. I found the overall experience much more enjoyable than the much-talked-about ""Grandmaster"" film (which I also reviewed on here for concerned martial arts fans). I did not feel that this film was of the same quality as the two Donnie Yen productions, but I felt that it captured the spirit established in the Yen films, and worked as a suitable closing chapter in depicting the life of this martial arts figure. The plot focuses on IP Man's later years where he is dealing with health issues as well as the changing economic climate around him. We meet several of IP Man's students, and are taken into some of the dramas playing out in their lives, so the film does have some slow segments. But when the fighting comes, it is crisp and ferocious, skillful, and fast-moving. I did not feel disappointed having purchased this film. The acting from most of the supporting cast was good enough to keep me engaged until the action took place. There are thought-provoking philosophical moments, particularly when a newspaper journalist--after witnessing some of IP Man's fighting--prints an incindiary article that riles up the head of another martial arts school, who then uses the newspaper to respond directly to Ip Man, which begins a brief war of philosophies in print, leading to their eventual physical confrontation.I felt there was enough martial arts action going on to satisfy patient fans, but you do have to wait for it. The film is not wall-to-wall action, but it is decent enough, definitely worth a look if, for no other reason, just to close out the saga of the IP Man. (And for those who may be wondering--yes, the film is very forthcoming with acknowledging IP Man's most famous student--though the great Dragon is never mentioned by name, nor is he ever glimpsed fully even when he appears in the film--but it is a much-appreciated acknowledgement.I didn't feel this film was a waste of my cash, though I didn't pay alot where I bought it.

1659992,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00DOFGEV2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","The interest in Ip Man films seems to still be going strong as yet another adaptation looks at the life of legendary martial arts Grandmaster Yip Man. It's starting to get a little confusing, however, with two different series covering similar ground.First there are the films directed by Wilson Yip and starring Donnie Yen as Yip Man:1) Ip Man (2008)2) Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster (2010)3) Ip Man 3 (proposed): Yet to be made, this effort has been announced in pre-production status with Edmond Wong taking the reins as the writer and director.And then there are the films by director Herman Yau (of which this is the second):1) The Legend is Born: Ip Man (2010)2) Ip Man: The Final Fight (2013)With ""Ip Man: The Final Fight,"" we examine the twilight years of Yip Man's life. Covering some of the same time period as ""Ip Man 2: The Legend of the Grandmaster,"" the film starts in 1949 as the Grandmaster travels to Hong Kong and leaves his life in Foshan. He sets up a rather humble establishment, teaching students the art of Wing Chun on the rooftop of a local business. His students are a varied lot and include a police man, a prison guard, a union leader, and a waitress among others. The students become very loyal to their teacher and form an extended family of sorts. Through the years, the interpersonal dynamics of the group will change but they are all united under their leader. The film examines these peripheral lives, but also features some family biographical information about Yip Man as well including his wife's last visit to Hong Kong, reuniting with his son later in life, and a late life flirtation with a much younger woman. For the few action sequences, the school battles a rival establishment (which is surprisingly silly) and they must also face down an infamous crime lord.I'm not sure exactly what type of picture ""Ip Man: The Final Fight"" wants to be. In many ways, it is a gently nostalgic character piece. While other pictures that have chronicled the life of Yip Man have been more based in action and extravagance (this is even much mellower than Yau's earlier film), this aims to be more biographical. After the initial set-up, the years start gliding by with rapidity. Although I liked the movie, I don't know that it was particularly successful overall. Anthony Wong is convincing and appealing as the aging Yip Man. I, however, was never particularly sold on the supporting cast. We never get to know them with much depth and that is a problem in a movie that seeks to be a character study. There are some nice moments throughout, to be sure, but I never felt very close to the heart of this movie. And when action elements were added in, it occasionally seemed awkward.Most of the movie showed hints of Wing Chun, but the movie really has only two extended fight sequences. In the first, the school goes to battle with a rival establishment. The confrontation is so corny, though, it might have come out of ""Happy Days"" with its unconvincing dialogue and tough guy posturing. The battle with the crime lord and his minions is staged better, but still boils down to a simplistic and over-the-top ""good versus evil"" showdown. What's worse, though, it never really makes sense with the rest of the movie. It's as if the director thought, ""I have to give them at least one big action moment"" whether it fit into the gentle tone of the movie or not. In the end, ""Ip Man: The Final Fight"" wants to be too many things to too many people. If it had developed its supporting characters, it might have made a strong drama. As is, it's fine without being particularly distinguished.

1659993,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00DOFGEV2,Matthew Scott Baker,"[0, 0]","Sometimes, simplicity is best.  This  must have been the philosophy behind IP MAN: THE FINAL FIGHT.  Whereas many martial arts films nowadays use wirework and vivid imagery to tell their stories, this film cuts right to the base roots of the subject matter and gives an action-filled movie that uses neither.  The result is a top notch action film with heart that pays great respect to the legendary Wing Chun master, Ip Man.I don't believe this film is a continuation of Donnie Yen's characterization of Ip Man.  I think this is a stand alone series.  But regardless, it is still very good and definitely worth checking out.  In this film, Ip Man is portrayed by Anthony Wong Chau-Sang, a legendary martial arts actor that I first saw way back in 1992 in John Woo's HARD BOILED.IP MAN: THE FINAL FIGHT is shot well and looks good onscreen.  The sets are simple but effective.  And the story moves along at a nice pace.The fight scenes are done well and very entertaining.  As I mentioned, they don't rely on a lot of wirework, but instead are point-blank rapid fire slug-fests.  My sole complaint is that there are simply not very many in the film.  More time is spent on building the circumstances around Ip Man's life in Hong Kong.I completely understand this lack of fights, as this is a biopic of sorts, and I certainly don't want to dissuade anyone from seeing this movie.  On the contrary, I am certainly recommending this one.  But I don't want folks going into this thinking it's a nonstop action extravaganza.IP MAN: THE FINAL FIGHT is a heck of a movie and is worth seeing if you are any kind of martial arts fan.

Set in post-war Hong Kong, &#8220;The Final Fight&#8221; is basically a drama about this iconic figure Ip Man (played here by Anthony Wong) with a few respectable martial arts sequences.Directed by prolific Hong Kong filmmaker Herman Yau (known for &#8220;Untold Story&#8221; starring Anthony Wong), &#8220;The Final Fight&#8221; has an impressive cast including Gillian Chung, Jordan Chan, Eric Tsang, Anita Yuen, Zhou Chuchu, Xin Xin Xiong and Ip Chun (Ip Man&#8217;s real-life son), as well as nice production design re-creating the 1950s Hong Kong streets, but as a drama it lacks focus and emotional impact.Anita Yuen is impressive as Ip Man&#8217;s wife, but her screen time is too short. The Wing Chun grandmaster&#8217;s brief &#8220;reunion&#8221; scene with Bruce Lee (though his name is not named) is at best cursory. Actor / martial artist Xin Xin Xiong, who was memorable as an assassin in Benny Chan&#8217;s &#8220;Shaolin,&#8221; is wasted.&#8220;The Final Fight&#8221; sets out to be a blend of bio-pic and action film that is more about Ip Man as an aging grandmaster than as a fierce fighter.
