968827,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B000E5N670,blackaciddevil,"[0, 0]","Though it wasn't the very first Japanese animated cartoon to be released in America, Speed Racer was the first to be successful here. With that in mind; Speed Racer is, as I've said before, considered to be the Godfather of Anime here in the USA. Many of us have fond memories of this show in its' original run which is why we're so excited it is on DVD now. Volume 4 has rolled around but it isn't quite what fans are hoping for. At least, not what I was hoping for, anyway. Volume 4 only includes 8 episodes of the show. They are episodes 37 through 44 of the show. That leaves 8 more for volume 5.Episodes in this volume has Speed and the gang going up against thieves, crime bosses, and the occasional person out to rule the world. Pretty typical for Speed, actually, for any who've seen the show. Still, as bizarre of adventures that Speed finds himself in, it is so much fun to watch. Thanks to there being only 8 episodes, the quality of visuals looks surprisingly better than the previous volume. No grainy look to this volume, thank goodness. This volume, however, only has one episode that is a two-parter as the rest are single episodes with stand alone stories(which is really unusual for Speed Racer). Sadly, other than the die-cast car of the Mach 5 that was included with this volume, there are no extras to speak of. The least they could have did was spoke to the vocal actors of the show to give their insight on Speed Racer. Unfortunately,no.All in all, I loved this volume..even though we only got 8 episodes. I really wish Lionsgates had put the remainder of them with this volume. Course, it might have brought down the visual quality of the episodes, I don't know. This volume will probably only appeal to fans of the show but casual fans should get into Speed Racer, it is a true classic.",5,"Speed Racer, Volume 4........",1236816000,"03 12, 2009",2009,1811,"['was', ""n't"", 'very', 'first', 'Japanese', 'animated', 'cartoon', 'be', 'released', 'America', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'was', 'first', 'be', 'successful', 'here', 'mind', 'Speed', 'Racer', ""'ve"", 'said', 'considered', 'be', 'Godfather', 'Anime', 'here', 'USA', 'Many', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'show', 'original', 'run', 'why', ""'re"", 'so', 'excited', 'DVD', 'now', 'Volume', '4', 'rolled', 'around', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'fans', 'are', 'hoping', 'least', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'hoping', 'anyway', 'Volume', '4', 'only', '8', 'episodes', 'show', 'are', 'episodes', '37', '44', 'show', '8', 'more', 'volume', '5.Episodes', 'volume', 'Speed', 'gang', 'going', 'up', 'thieves', 'crime', 'bosses', 'occasional', 'person', 'rule', 'world', 'Pretty', 'typical', 'Speed', 'actually', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'show', 'Still', 'bizarre', 'adventures', 'Speed', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'Thanks', 'there', 'being', 'only', '8', 'episodes', 'quality', 'visuals', 'looks', 'surprisingly', 'better', 'previous', 'volume', 'grainy', 'look', 'volume', 'thank', 'goodness', 'volume', 'however', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'two-parter', 'rest', 'are', 'single', 'episodes', 'stand', 'alone', 'stories', 'really', 'unusual', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'Sadly', 'other', 'die-cast', 'car', 'Mach', '5', 'was', 'included', 'volume', 'are', 'extras', 'speak', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'did', 'was', 'spoke', 'vocal', 'actors', 'show', 'give', 'insight', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'Unfortunately', 'no.All', 'loved', 'volume..even', 'only', 'got', '8', 'episodes', 'really', 'wish', 'Lionsgates', 'had', 'put', 'remainder', 'volume', 'Course', 'might', 'have', 'brought', 'down', 'visual', 'quality', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'volume', 'will', 'probably', 'only', 'appeal', 'fans', 'show', 'casual', 'fans', 'should', 'get', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'true', 'classic']","Speed Racer, Vol. 4 - Episodes 37-44"

A lot of reviews have already been written about this vol., but I wanted to make a few points.First of all, of the first 1-4 volumes, this is the most violent.  Again, it's cartoon violence and doesn't seem particularly gratuitous, but I waited a full year until my daughter was 6 before letting her watch these.  Older kids, I'm sure, will have no trouble with the material.Second, one of the series is very much like a previous episode ""Car Hater"", but it's still a good story.Finally, I have to say that there are more twists and turns in this one than I remember in the First Two sets of Speed Racers.  One of them, ""The Man in the Mask"", actually left me and my daughter gasping with shock at the end!Very exciting stories; and, I think they have a good message, too, of Right Vs. Wrong, Good Vs.

Why did the Studio decide to split the final 16 episodes of ""Speed Racer"" into two volumes? The entire series only had 52 episodes, so why 5 volumes instead of a complete series set?The Studio has resorted to cheap gimmicks from the start to sell their DVD's and that's just wrong. The first season had rubber tire packaging (neat). The second season had a slip cover with music and blinking headlights (cool). The third season was a DVD in a cheap tin can (very cheap). The fourth season contains only 8 episodes and comes with a 1/64 scale die cast Mach 5 (big deal). I don't know about the rest of you but I stopped playing with dinky cars a long time ago and I would have liked the final 16 episodes in one volume. Why didn't the Studio just release the entire series in a limited edition boxed set with a bigger die cast?
