Driver, (Dwayne Johnson) is freed from prison and promptly runs down the gravel road outside the prison into the sunset and thus starts his quest to revenge the death of his brother.There are some good things about FASTER. First of all, Dwayne Johnson steps away from his mostly light-hearted movie past and goes all out Dirty Harry in this one. It was weird at first, D.J. being all serious, but ultimately, it'll probably be a good thing for him, because he pulled it off pretty well. In fact, there were even some moments of challenge and morality and regret for the things he felt compelled to do, and they were well done.FASTER is gifted with some good side stories and some nice twists that keep the movie interesting and divert it from its one note path. One being a professional hitman that fears that he may have met his match. The other being the cop, played by Billy Bob Thornton, who is saddled with his apprehension after Driver quite unceremoniously puts a notch in a cubicle office guys skull.It's a violent and moody piece of work that surprised me a bit.

I had no interest when this came out in theaters but it was a buck at redbox, so why not I asked myself. Not being that big of a fan of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson already, it is quite difficult to see him in films and find him enjoyable. After selling his soul to Disney movies it seems he's is back to action. Though being no special actor, a revenge film is a much better choice for him in my opinion, who does not like vengeanance? The Rock reminds of Stallone in the newest Rambo. The only reason I could fathom the movie was because Rambo did not talk much throughout the movie, just brutally killed everyone. Ha, now this film is better because the Rock doesn't talk much if you catch what I'm saying. I would not look for ""stand-out"" acting performances besides Carla Gugino in the film, the others are nothing special. I found her enjoyable and attractive. There are no actual names given to characters in the film either which was interesting. There is literally DRIVER, COP, and THE KILLER. You could have called the movie that and gotten away from it. ""The Driver, The Cop...The Killer"". The title comes from the killer's wife asking if the driver (the rock) was as fast as him...A simple reply of ""Faster"" is then said. The action in the film is quite good though. The film itself does not really having many dull moments at all throughout it. There are quite a few head shots that look very realistic without the new CGI blood that everyone uses nowadays, which was nice to see. There is a semi-understandable, yet very unbelievable story about getting revenge on the people who killed his brother, but its a movie so take it with a grain of salt like I said earlier. I'd rent too, before purchasing. This one might not be for everyone, but for me (someone who did not expect much at all) I enjoyed it surprisingly and did not fast forward.

This is a movie that places characters in a strip club, where the dancers keep their tops on; something almost as irritating as characters who have just slept with one another but feel the need to cover up. What is the point in having that scene then, and where is the realism? Faster isn't about nudity, but the strip club scene, much like the covering up with bed sheets - reminds me that I'm not only watching a movie, but that I'm watching a bad one.Dwayne Johnson stars as a character known only to us as `Driver' via a title card (text on the screen). LAME. Billy Bob Thornton is `Cop' from a title card as well. Again, LAME. And the third lead's title card says `Killer.' LAMER than LAME.The first 10 minutes or so were actually very good. I was pumped. I snuggled into my seat ready to see Dwayne Johnson just start slaughtering people. We meet Driver pacing in his prison cell as he's about to be released. He sits down for a little chat with the warden, pulsating with desperation to get out; and when asked if he has any questions he simply responds with, ""Where's the exit?""This is pretty much the only dialogue he's had during this entire opening and we love it. Johnson is carrying every scene with his mannerisms and facial expressions. Soon enough however, we realize this is about the extent of the little depth that we are going to get from this guy, Driver. I'd be amazed if he had more than 15 lines in the entire movie. Seriously.In addition to this, all we know about him is that his brother was murdered and that he is going to track down and kill everyone responsible. For this kind of film, maybe that could almost be forgiven; except for when we know entirely way too much about all of the side characters.We learn all about Cop's heroin addiction and marital problems. Killer, who is a hit man hired to kill Driver, has a lovely new wife, has mastered yoga, has made millions in the software business, and enjoys killing so much that he charges only a single dollar as his fee. Why do we need to know all of these things? Who cares about these characters? I sure didn't.

1321801,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0034G4OUO,C. Sawin,"[12, 21]","THIS DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!I've always wanted to like Dwayne Johnson as an actor. He was so entertaining when he was The Rock, why can't his movies be just as entertaining? Unfortunately his best received films are the more family oriented ones and watching an ex-wrestler who used to talk about his love for pie and ""laying the smackdown on all your candy asses"" seems a bit bittersweet. Films like Faster are what Johnson should be sticking to, but it doesn't live up to its potential and results in another flat action film.Wasted potential is the perfect way to describe Faster. Dwayne Johnson spends more time walking around looking pissed off than he does killing anyone or actually saying anything at all. Billy Bob Thornton doesn't do much of anything either as his character struggles between being a drug addict who doesn't amount to anything to a police officer who's about to retire and get full benefits who is also trying to get his family back together again. He spends most of his screen time drowning in his pathetic life. Then there's Dexter's Jennifer Carpenter who seems to be brought into the film to do nothing more than show up, cry a little, and say stupid things. Nothing the actors did really helped drive the story forward.The cinematography fluctuated between being interesting and being incredibly annoying. Right when something like the way the camera was placed while the driver was driving or something as simple as reloading a gun was done in a way that seemed original to catch your attention, the film would turn around and throw shaky camera techniques at you for no reason or the scenes that caught your eye would be too brief to really make up for the mediocrity of the rest of the film. The most interesting aspect lies within the final minutes and relates to the hired killer going after the driver. That concept alone that's about the length of a one minute conversation is better than Faster as a whole.Dwayne Johnson seems to have better luck with family films, but I think his fans would rather see him in R-rated action films since his physique and film presence fit that genre best. If he could find a film that was like Faster with a meatier role that gave him more lines and had better writing, it'd probably be a lot more satisfying. The kills in Faster should have been the highlight since the film revolved around the driver gaining revenge for his brother, but they fell short. Everything about Faster did. I was completely expecting Johnson to either turn himself over to the authorities or kill himself to be with his brother at the end of the film. The driver received the revenge he so desperately seeked and did it in a nonchalant, hot-shot vigilante kind of way to let everyone know it was him doing it. Yet police can't seem to keep up with him and he just kind of drives off into the sunset at the end. It felt like Faster was left open ended for nothing more than sequel purposes alone, which is the weakest form of a cop out for a movie ending. Coincidentally, a film called Faster managed to feel twice as long as its 98 minute duration.In the end, Faster contains elements from both Gone in Sixty Seconds and Taxi Driver, which should result in an excellent film. Instead we're left with an action film that uses these elements at face value; it contains the fast cars and intense chases of Gone in Sixty Seconds with the uneasy and unpredictable shootouts that are reminiscent of Taxi Driver but Faster lacks the depth, star power, enjoyment factor, strong cast, or lasting value these two films still have today. If you plan on seeing this film, you better be sure because that's a long dark road you're headed down (sorry, couldn't resist) and that road is nothing more than a pointless detour from greater things.",2,Potentially disappointing,1290470400,"11 23, 2010",2010,3781,"['THIS', 'CONTAIN', 'SPOILERS', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'like', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'actor', 'was', 'so', 'entertaining', 'when', 'was', 'Rock', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'movies', 'be', 'just', 'entertaining', 'Unfortunately', 'best', 'received', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'family', 'oriented', 'ones', 'watching', 'ex-wrestler', 'who', 'used', 'talk', 'love', 'pie', 'laying', 'smackdown', 'candy', 'asses', 'bit', 'bittersweet', 'Films', 'Faster', 'are', 'what', 'Johnson', 'should', 'be', 'sticking', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'results', 'flat', 'action', 'film.Wasted', 'potential', 'perfect', 'way', 'describe', 'Faster', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'more', 'time', 'walking', 'around', 'looking', 'pissed', 'off', 'killing', 'anyone', 'actually', 'saying', 'anything', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'anything', 'character', 'being', 'drug', 'addict', 'who', ""n't"", 'amount', 'anything', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'retire', 'get', 'full', 'benefits', 'who', 'also', 'trying', 'get', 'family', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'drowning', 'pathetic', 'life', 'Then', 'Dexter', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'who', 'be', 'brought', 'film', 'do', 'nothing', 'more', 'show', 'up', 'cry', 'little', 'say', 'stupid', 'things', 'Nothing', 'actors', 'did', 'really', 'helped', 'drive', 'story', 'forward.The', 'cinematography', 'fluctuated', 'being', 'interesting', 'being', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'Right', 'when', 'something', 'way', 'camera', 'was', 'placed', 'driver', 'was', 'driving', 'something', 'as', 'simple', 'reloading', 'gun', 'was', 'done', 'way', 'seemed', 'original', 'catch', 'attention', 'film', 'would', 'turn', 'around', 'throw', 'shaky', 'camera', 'techniques', 'reason', 'scenes', 'caught', 'eye', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'brief', 'really', 'make', 'up', 'mediocrity', 'rest', 'film', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'final', 'minutes', 'hired', 'killer', 'going', 'driver', 'concept', 'alone', 'length', 'one', 'minute', 'conversation', 'better', 'Faster', 'whole.Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'have', 'better', 'luck', 'family', 'films', 'think', 'fans', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'R-rated', 'action', 'films', 'physique', 'film', 'presence', 'fit', 'best', 'could', 'find', 'film', 'was', 'Faster', 'meatier', 'role', 'gave', 'more', 'lines', 'had', 'better', 'writing', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'satisfying', 'kills', 'Faster', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'highlight', 'film', 'revolved', 'driver', 'gaining', 'revenge', 'brother', 'fell', 'short', 'Everything', 'Faster', 'did', 'was', 'completely', 'expecting', 'Johnson', 'turn', 'authorities', 'kill', 'be', 'brother', 'end', 'film', 'driver', 'received', 'revenge', 'so', 'desperately', 'seeked', 'did', 'nonchalant', 'hot-shot', 'vigilante', 'kind', 'way', 'let', 'everyone', 'know', 'was', 'doing', 'police', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'keep', 'up', 'just', 'kind', 'drives', 'sunset', 'end', 'felt', 'Faster', 'was', 'left', 'open', 'ended', 'nothing', 'more', 'sequel', 'purposes', 'alone', 'weakest', 'form', 'cop', 'out', 'movie', 'ending', 'Coincidentally', 'film', 'called', 'Faster', 'managed', 'feel', 'twice', 'as', 'long', '98', 'minute', 'duration.In', 'end', 'Faster', 'elements', 'Gone', 'Sixty', 'Seconds', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'should', 'result', 'excellent', 'film', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'left', 'action', 'film', 'elements', 'face', 'value', 'fast', 'cars', 'intense', 'chases', 'Gone', 'Sixty', 'Seconds', 'uneasy', 'unpredictable', 'shootouts', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Faster', 'depth', 'star', 'power', 'enjoyment', 'factor', 'strong', 'cast', 'lasting', 'value', 'two', 'films', 'still', 'have', 'today', 'plan', 'seeing', 'film', 'better', 'be', 'sure', 'long', 'dark', 'road', ""'re"", 'headed', 'down', 'sorry', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'road', 'nothing', 'more', 'pointless', 'detour', 'greater', 'things']",N/A

And it will be a dish served warm--warm as blood.That's the basic plot of FASTER.  We're not talking rocket science here.  George Tillman, Jr., has crafted a decent homage to the action/revenge flicks of yore, without adding (or, in his defense, trying to add) anything knew to the genre.  In the titular role, Dwayne Johnson is perfectly adequate: he's perhaps a bit too kid-friendly these days, but he's big and tough and bada**.  As the Cop who's chasing him, Billy Bob Thornton gives another solid ""man conflicted"" portrayal (few do it better than him).  As the Killer assigned to kill Driver, Oliver Jackson-Cohen is smooth, sleak, and intelligent.  Carla Gugino is reliably solid as Cop's reluctant partner; and Tom Berenger turns in a neat cameo (no spoilers, it's early enough) as the Warden.You'll notice a lot of archetypal names; that's because there's nothing personal about FASTER, which is both a blessing and a curse.  It's interesting to see an antihero who is neither sympathetic nor repulsive; as the Killer describes him, he's just ""completely artless...there's no sophistication to him whatsoever, but he's pure.""  And yet, you can count on both hands the lines of dialogue Johnson has in this film; a little of his trademark wit would've helped the archetypes go down smoother.  Plus, we're supposed to care about the Cop's family troubles, but we don't, because we are far more interested in his heroin addiction.  The Killer's personal life is interesting but pointless; again, we're more interested in his desire to become better (he's sees Driver as a challenge to be surpassed, telling his girlfriend that he has already ""beat"" yoga).You'll have to take FASTER on your own terms.  It's violent and (pun ahead) fast, and not for the faint of heart; you have to like revenge thrillers to enjoy this one, or at least be mildly entertained by them.  Kudos go to Thornton and Jackson-Cohen, who give performances above and beyond the scripted material.  Johnson still has great screen presence, but this isn't the film to showcase his talents.

Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","In 2011, Dwayne Johnson (""The Scorpion King"", ""The Other Guys"", ""Race to Witch Mountain"") made his action film comeback with ""Faster"" directed by George Tillman Jr. (""Barbershop"" films) and written by Tony and Joe Gayton (""Bulletproof"", ""Uncommon Valor"", ""Sweet Jane"").Starring alongside Johnson are Billy Bob Thornton (""Sling Blade"", ""Armageddon"", ""Monster's Ball""), Carla Gugino (""Watchmen"", ""Sin City"", ""Night at the Museum""), Moon Bloodgood (""Terminator Salvation"", ""Eight Below"", ""Pathfinder""), Oliver Jackson-Cohen (""Going the Distance""), Maggie Grace (""Lost"", ""Taken"", ""Knight and Day""), Tom Berenger (""Platoon"", ""Inception"", ""Training Day""), Jennifer Carpenter (""Dexter"", ""Quarantine"") and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (""Lost"", ""G.I. Joe"", ""The Bourne Identity"").VIDEO:""Faster"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The film looks absolutely gorgeous in HD!  Plenty of details can be seen throughout this film, from the detail and textures of the skin pores of every character during closeups, facial hair on the guys, detail on the guns, detail on surroundings, what you would expect from a recent film, ""Faster"" looks awesome!  There is detail from the sweat and blood all over Driver, the detail of the firearms, the vehicles, you name it, the detail is what comes through in this Blu-ray release.Outdoor scenes are colorful and vibrant, blacks are nice and deep, I saw no signs of any dust particles, artifacting, banding, DNR, edge enhancement or aliasing whatsoever.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Faster"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and the lossless soundtrack is also awesome!  Driver's luger packs a punch and when he and Killer are exchanging fire, audio was well utilized through the surround channels and definitely bringing an immersive soundtrack to the viewer.  And this happens quite a bit throughout the film as there is quite a bit of gunfire, cars speeding up and burning rubber and hearing the tires shriek, automobile crashes and hearing the metal crunching, bullets ricocheting off metal.Overall, a pretty good use of surround and LFE.  Granted, it's not as active as ""Quantum of Solace"" but it's still features a solid lossless soundtrack and fans of this film should enjoy hearing it in lossless.Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Faster"" comes with the following special features (presented in high definition, English stereo and optional English subtitles):*** PS3 Theme - If you have a PS3 theme, you can get a grayish theme with Dwayne Johnson holding his gun.* movieIQ+sync - If you're Blu-ray is connected to the Internet, you can pull up info. on the film realtime.* Alternate Ending with Director's Introduction - (12:42) The original ending to ""Faster"" that didn't do well during the test screening.  Some may like this ending more than the final cut, I did like it...but I enjoyed the final cut ending more.  There is a different outcome to the ending of the film.  Featuring an optional introduction by director George Tillman Jr.* Deleted Scenes with Director's Introductions - (7:54) Featuring five deleted scenes with optional introductions by director George Tillman Jr.* Criminals & Cops: The Cast of Faster - (12:12) Featuring an interview with director George Tillman Jr. and the cast of ""Faster"".* Weapons and Wheels: The Guns, Cars and Stunts of Faster - (11:54) A featurette featuring the weapons, cars and stunts used on ""Faster"".* Animatics - (12:22) Featuring the storyboard and pre-rendered CG storyboards for the bank heist, old man, hospital and joust scenes.JUDGMENT CALL:The Rock has come back to action films!And after trying different genres, there is no doubt that Dwayne Johnson doing action films fits perfectly for him.  You want to see Johnson in films where he is kicking butt and ""Walking Tall"" was a perfect example of where Johnson shines as an action film star.  It's what many people have seen him do as ""The Rock"" on WWE and so, his return to action films in ""Faster"" was expected and if there is one thing that can be positively said about this film is that the Brahma Bull brings it!But unlike his previous films, Johnson's character ""Driver"" is not a good guy.  He's a criminal, he's a murderer and while you are sympathetic for his cause, I feel that the character is one that will easily turn people off and those who will want to see Dwayne Johnson do what he does best, playing a character who wants to kick some ass!For the most part, this action film is an entertaining popcorn action flick that is quite watchable, adrenal and enjoyable but if you try to extract what is deep about satisfying about the movie, that is where ""Faster"" comes up short.One major positive about the film is its cast.  You have an all-star cast and while most of them don't show up for all that long, the storyline's focus on four different characters is quite interesting. Outside of Johnson's ""Driver"", Billy Bob Thornton can always pull off the Cop-like character.  Granted, he's not a likable cop, as his first initial shot shows him to be a drug addict, but Billy Bob knows how to play these type of character roles.  Carla Gugino as Detective Cicero was not well utilized in my opinion and possibly the characters that you do find pretty cool and feel they should have their own movie is Oliver Jackson-Cohen's ""Killer"" and Maggie Grace's ""Lily"".And that for me lies the problem.  We enjoy the characters too much.In some ways, I felt we shouldn't.  Sympathetic, I understand but the Driver was fine, playing the man carrying out his revenge.  The Killer should have been some deranged, psycho lunatic.  The Cop could stay the way he was and for Cicero, a more definitive position of a woman in power, rather one who feels she is getting shortchanged by the Cop.Sure, the concept would fit into the banality of revenge action films but it works.  Instead, we are left with plot holes that make no sense.  Why was the ordeal videotaped?  Why do the police have that videotape?Also, I do believe that there is one crucial deleted scene that should have been included in the film and it deals with the Cop and the character of Marina.  I know that George Tillman Jr. didn't want to cut it but he did and I felt it was a mistake.  I also feel the ""Kill Bill""-esque type of storyline and killing one's parent and then warning their child about if they want to come at him for revenge was just too contrived.But in the end, it all comes down to is the film's writing and execution.  The writers made these characters too likable and while the film is focused on the driver, they made the audience supporting the suave Killer and his girlfriend Lily even more (which prompted the change of the original ending of the storyline).I will say that George Tillman Jr. does take a big step forward from his ""Barbershop"" film years by directing this action film.  ""Faster"" is a visually cool looking film and on Blu-ray, the picture quality and audio quality is great!  The special features were also good but it would have helped to have a director's commentary and giving Tillman a chance to reflect on certain scenes and if he would have done anything different.With that being said, I still enjoyed ""Faster"" as a popcorn action flick that features a good number of stars in the film.  On Blu-ray, I felt that the picture quality and lossless audio soundtrack definitely enhanced my enjoyment of the film.But if you enjoy Dwayne Johnson action films  and you want to see him in a more violent film and see him ultimately kick some ass, I have no doubt that ""Faster"" is a film that you will definitely enjoy.",4,"Blu-ray: Violent, gritty and high on adrenaline...a solid popcorn

Without even being out a full day he kills the first guy. We later learn that he's on a revenge streak going after the people that killed his brother and almost fatally wounded him. We also get to see the stories of a hired gun hunting him and a cop (Billy Bob Thornton) chasing him.....PQ: This presentation comes extremely close to the intended goal. It isn't overly sharp and contains a fair bit of grain but it actually comes very, very close to the theatrical presentation. Colors and fleshtones are accurate. Luckily no DNR or Edge Enhancement was used to make the Picture ""better""..as the rest of this presentation, the picture quality was a welcome surpriseSQ: We are provided with a DTS HD Master 5.1 Soundtrack by Sony here and it's pretty awesome. Dialogue is always kicking. You constantly have ambient noise in the back. The subwoofer is called to action when needed. There are some nice Sound Pans too in this one. For this kinda movie a pretty good soundtrack.Summary: Considering that I watched this movie with almost no expectiations whatsoever I was pretty blown away by this one. The story was deeper and contained more character development than the last 10 action films I saw. All the actors were on the top of their game. Even those that had very small parts. (Like Tom Berenger)... This movie is really so much more than a stupid revenge killer movie. The quality of the BD Presentation is above average.

1321814,AT2ONGBAQ8HFD,B0034G4OUO,Ema Nnep,"[1, 2]","I think that Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock is a very fine actor because he's versatile.  He can kick butt and throw down with the best of the hardcore action hero types but he can also do comedy.This movie ain't no comedy.  His character is all about obtaining justice for the one person in his entire life that he could always count on and who always stuck up for him: his brother.Let's be clear, the characters in this entire movie, with the exception of just a few, are all criminals to one degree or another.  The brother, who is technically his half brother (mom cheated on the husband and couldn't hide it when she gave birth to a bi-racial son) is a bank robber, just like his old man and his buddies.  His kid brother, played by Dwayne/The Rock, knows how to drive like a demon, but his olde brother who loves him and doesn't want him getting caught up in the family business tries to keep him out of the plots and plans that he puts together to take down banks.It was just a fluke that his older brother's regular driver wasn't able to make the gig and Dwayne/The Rock steps up to help his brother out because he's afraid that if he doesn't, something will go wrong and his brother will get caught.The robbery goes off without a hitch...  Yes, there is a gritty police chase, but as I mentioned, he drives like a demon and he gets them out of it without leaving a trace for the cops to follow.  The problem comes when their group is betrayed and another group shows up to rob them of their ill gotten gains from the bank heist.It is during this robbery that everyone in his older brother's crew gets hit, including the older brother getting his throat slit in front of Dwayne/The Rock, and it's in that last moment between the brothers that you see how much they love each other and how the older brother is still trying to reassure his little brother that everything would be all right...That's why Dwayne/The Rock's character is determined to get justice for his brother and he waits for ten long years while he plots and plans and does everything he can to get money inside prison to fund his plans on the outside.  He stays as clean inside as he can and doesn't start trouble, but when the guys on the inside come after him, he leaves them far worse for wear and has gained a serious and significant reputation inside and outside the walls of the prison.When he gets out he has a list of names and everyone on that list has something to answer for, starting with the guys who killed his brother and the crew.It's gritty and raw and perhaps a bit more vigilante than some might like, but this movie has some significant undertones that resonate with you.The love this guy had for his brother, and the love his brother had for him, sticking up for him against his own father who took out his frustration and anger on the innocent kid who came from the wife's infidelity forged a bond between the brothers that was powerful and something nobody should have messed with.That kind of bond can't be replaced and when it was broken by this pack of sleazy jerks, there's only one thing to be done and that was put the rabid dogs down, one at a time until there's nobody left who gained anything from the murder.Then, and only then, is the job done and that's what Dwayne/The Rock does, taking each one off his hit list until he's fulfilled his promise to his brother that they would pay for what they had done to him.Now, as much as I really enjoyed this film, there were parts in it that were exceedingly lame, namely the whole character of the multi millionaire hitman who works for $1 per target, and his blonde bombshell girlfriend over whom he has clear angst and needs to get therapy via cell phone while he's tracking his target, who is the main character.  And then he pitches a fit when he's face to face with his target demanding 'a little professional acknowledgement' of his skills as a hitman while he has a gun in Dwayne/The Rock's face...  Quite frankly, that whole character and his girlfriend could both have been left out of the story and NOTHING would have been lost.Still, even with that lame story subplot as noted above, this was a great movie where you root for the 'bad' guy because he's doing what needs to be done and you're entertained from start to finish.",5,It isn't revenge when it's justified,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,4287,"['think', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'Rock', 'very', 'fine', 'actor', 'versatile', 'can', 'kick', 'butt', 'throw', 'down', 'best', 'hardcore', 'action', 'hero', 'types', 'can', 'also', 'do', 'comedy.This', 'movie', 'ai', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'character', 'obtaining', 'justice', 'one', 'person', 'entire', 'life', 'could', 'always', 'count', 'who', 'always', 'stuck', 'up', 'brother.Let', 'be', 'clear', 'characters', 'entire', 'movie', 'exception', 'just', 'few', 'are', 'criminals', 'one', 'degree', 'brother', 'who', 'technically', 'half', 'brother', 'mom', 'cheated', 'husband', 'could', ""n't"", 'hide', 'when', 'gave', 'birth', 'bi-racial', 'son', 'bank', 'robber', 'just', 'old', 'man', 'buddies', 'kid', 'brother', 'played', 'Dwayne/The', 'Rock', 'how', 'drive', 'demon', 'olde', 'brother', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'family', 'business', 'tries', 'keep', 'plots', 'plans', 'together', 'take', 'down', 'was', 'just', 'fluke', 'older', 'brother', 'regular', 'driver', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'make', 'gig', 'Dwayne/The', 'Rock', 'up', 'help', 'brother', 'out', 'afraid', ""n't"", 'something', 'will', 'go', 'wrong', 'brother', 'will', 'get', 'caught.The', 'robbery', 'off', 'hitch', 'Yes', 'gritty', 'police', 'chase', 'mentioned', 'demon', 'leaving', 'trace', 'cops', 'follow', 'problem', 'when', 'group', 'betrayed', 'group', 'up', 'rob', 'ill', 'gotten', 'gains', 'bank', 'heist.It', 'robbery', 'everyone', 'older', 'brother', 'crew', 'hit', 'including', 'older', 'brother', 'getting', 'throat', 'slit', 'front', 'Dwayne/The', 'Rock', 'last', 'moment', 'brothers', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'other', 'how', 'older', 'brother', 'still', 'trying', 'reassure', 'little', 'brother', 'everything', 'would', 'be', 'all', 'right', 'why', 'Dwayne/The', 'Rock', 'character', 'determined', 'get', 'justice', 'brother', 'ten', 'long', 'years', 'plans', 'everything', 'can', 'get', 'money', 'prison', 'fund', 'plans', 'outside', 'clean', 'can', ""n't"", 'start', 'trouble', 'when', 'guys', 'inside', 'come', 'far', 'worse', 'wear', 'gained', 'serious', 'significant', 'reputation', 'walls', 'prison.When', 'out', 'list', 'names', 'everyone', 'list', 'something', 'answer', 'starting', 'guys', 'who', 'killed', 'brother', 'crew.It', 'gritty', 'raw', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'more', 'vigilante', 'might', 'like', 'movie', 'significant', 'undertones', 'resonate', 'you.The', 'love', 'guy', 'had', 'brother', 'love', 'brother', 'had', 'sticking', 'up', 'own', 'father', 'who', 'took', 'out', 'frustration', 'anger', 'innocent', 'kid', 'who', 'came', 'wife', 'infidelity', 'forged', 'bond', 'brothers', 'was', 'powerful', 'something', 'nobody', 'should', 'have', 'messed', 'kind', 'bond', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'replaced', 'when', 'was', 'broken', 'pack', 'sleazy', 'jerks', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'be', 'done', 'was', 'put', 'rabid', 'dogs', 'down', 'one', 'time', 'nobody', 'left', 'who', 'gained', 'anything', 'murder.Then', 'only', 'then', 'job', 'done', 'what', 'Dwayne/The', 'Rock', 'taking', 'one', 'hit', 'list', 'fulfilled', 'promise', 'brother', 'would', 'pay', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'him.Now', 'as', 'much', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'were', 'parts', 'were', 'exceedingly', 'lame', 'namely', 'whole', 'character', 'multi', 'millionaire', 'hitman', 'who', '1', 'target', 'blonde', 'bombshell', 'girlfriend', 'whom', 'clear', 'angst', 'get', 'therapy', 'cell', 'phone', 'tracking', 'target', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'then', 'fit', 'when', 'face', 'face', 'target', 'demanding', 'little', 'professional', 'acknowledgement', 'skills', 'hitman', 'gun', 'Dwayne/The', 'Rock', 'face', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'whole', 'character', 'girlfriend', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'story', 'NOTHING', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost.Still', 'even', 'lame', 'story', 'subplot', 'noted', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'where', 'root', ""'bad"", 'guy', 'doing', 'what', 'be', 'done', ""'re"", 'entertained', 'start', 'finish']",N/A
1321815,A2VEY1TSG8P1PM,B0034G4OUO,Ethan Gorham,"[1, 1]","Pretentiousness is something I absolutely can't stand in movies. For me, pretentious films, like Never Let Me Go, Sucker Punch, or Meek's Cutoff are much, much harder to sit through than bottom-of-the-barrel BS like Bucky Larson: Born To Be A Star, The Roommate, or Vampires Suck. Why? While the BS makes you feel sorry for yourself for ever having sat through it, pretentious flicks just make you mad, because their overinflated egos are right in your face.So, where am I going with this?Because, in the movie-going world, Faster is a revelation of sorts. It is gracefully not BS and thankfully not pretentious.Now, that's not to say it is awards material (although I'd argue the Cinematography is), but in a cinema plagued with trash, Faster is the kind of film you're glad to see because it knows what it is, knows what it isn't, and just tries to make the most out of its B-movie story.Yeah, this is a B-movie. You're not going to stare at the screen and 90 minutes later learn something profound about Humanity's place in the universe. This ain't that kind of movie. From the first shot of The Rock's built up pecs, you're going to see a man's kind of movie with guns, chases, and blood with a neat little throwback to Film Noir and the revenge flicks of the 1970s in between. It is all style and practically no substance.This is the kind of movie you either like or you don't, and there isn't much more to say than that. If what you want in a movie is something the Oscars would fawn all over, this ain't really for you unless you appreciate Cinematography most in a movie. If what you want in a movie is something modest, this is one great way to spend an afternoon.Now, regarding the Blu Ray, the manufacturers did a hell of a job here. The picture is pristine, with a fine layer of grain (the film was shot on 35mm). Colors and Shadows are dead on, with no digital noise and no weird-ass DNR. The sound is a kick to the woofers, with dialogue perfectly audible and sound effects perfectly triumphant and full of oomph!. A bang-up presentation. Regarding Special Features, the main mini-docs on the cast and crew and cars are practically promos, so they're skippable. What you want to see is the deleted scenes. While they're not merely filler or beats that are take-it-or-leave-it like most deleted scenes, these scenes are so terrible you have to see them to believe them (the alternate ending in particular).However, I must put out something of particular note. While I can't say this is a film I love, it is one I like, and a movie I've managed to have seen more than 10 times. The Blu Ray I received is different than the DVD, almost like a different, more rougher cut of the film. A hymn plays during the opening music number where once there was none. The guards now have dialogue when they didn't before and the prisoners now are audibly clear, where once they were but intimidating and muffled growls and shouts behind glass.

There is however a kind of pointless subplot about a hitman who is on Dwayne's tail. All of the scenes featuring the hitman and his girlfriend serve only to pad out the film and slow down the pace.

But this film as written by Tony and Joe Gayton and directed by George Tillman, Jr. proves to be more.  At the core of this story is the way revenge eats at the soul and almost makes a good man bad.Driver (Dwayne Johnson in a fine brooding role more dependent on physicality than words) is released from ten years in prison for his involvement in a double-crossed heist during which his brother was killed: Driver has only one thing on his mind and that is to track down and kill all those involved in the murder. Seemingly without feeling he manages to kill some of those on the list, a trend the Cop (Billy Bob Thornton, an addict just weeks away from retirement) and Cicero (Carla Gugino), his boss, begin to trace.  One of the designated conspirators hires hit man Killer (Oliver Jackson-Cohen, an actor with fine screen presence to watch carefully) to kill Driver. Clues are added and the chase becomes more frantic as Driver slowly murders his brother's killers.  But compassion and insight enter Driver's persona and his path is deviated by some victims' pleas.  The ending is well written and is a surprise in every way.Johnson has become so muscular as to distort his presence, but that is likely a preparation for this role: he is convincing in a role with very little lines.  Thornton contributes his usual excellent skills to his multifaceted role and Moon Bloodgood is outstanding as his long-suffering addict wife.  There are cameos for fine actors such as Mike Epps, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as an tent revival evangelist, Tom Berenger as the prison warden, Maggie Grace as Killer's girlfriend, and Annie Corley as Driver's mother. But keep an eye on Oliver Jackson-Cohen - he shows considerable promise. FASTER is fast, to the point, minimalist film making that swiftly drives to a surprising finish.

1321825,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0034G4OUO,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Ten years behind bars, and he's so antsy. You see the Rock's character - anonymously labeled ""Driver"" - as he restlessly paces in his prison cell, waiting out his last morning in stir, and you know something festers on his mind. Any musings as to whether he's truly been rehabilitated is put to rest when he erupts out the penitentiary and straight away visits an office and guns down a telemarketer. That's cold-blooded. That's one name off his list (yes, there is a list).It's good to see the Rock straying from those sappy family friendly Disney flicks. Good to see him return to his roots and bolstering his action hero street creds. FASTER works off the conventions of a B-movie revenge thriller, and good performances from Dwayne Johnson and Billy Bob Thornton elevate this thing. There are moments of pure cool cinema, like that point of view perspective from the other side of the car's speedometer which allows us a peek out at the seething face of the Rock. I don't think I've seen a revenge thriller this lean and raw and entertaining since Mel Gibson's PAYBACK more than a decade ago.FASTER  is told mainly from three perspectives: the Driver, the Killer, and the drug junkie Cop, with the latter two trying to catch up to the Driver as he continues to eliminate those what done him wrong, those what murdered his brother. Just about every character here is one-dimensional, but Johnson manages to lend nuance to his laconic role. Billy Bob Thornton, as he usually does, adds a little somethin' somethin' to his scruffy, 10-days-to-retirement police detective.One peculiar choice is the film's decision to devote so much camera time and back story to Oliver Jackson-Cohen's elegant contract hit man. He sees in Driver that one challenge he's been looking for, the one guy who may be faster than he is and that gets his competitive juices flowing. But, frankly, ultimately, I didn't think this hit man was all that interesting. He's what passes for shallow glitter. I did get a laugh though that Jackson-Cohen's biggest peeve there at the end seems to be that he's just not getting the professional courtesy he feels he deserves from the Rock. Jackson-Cohen certainly adds an element of quirk, and it doesn't hurt that his personal arc presents the stunning Maggie Grace as eye candy. Grace, Carla Gugino, and Moon Bloodgood somewhat take the edge off the testosterone level, never mind that Gugino herself plays a tough cop detective.Dwayne Johnson strides across the screen as a simmering, single-minded force of nature. He relentlessly drives the film, ratcheting up the pace of the story, and maybe it's a good thing after all that Jackson-Cohen's posh assassin gets his moments because this allows the viewing audience to breathe a bit. I did feel that the film backed away a bit from completely portraying Driver as the hard-bitten ex-convict out for vengeance come hell or high water.

Especially when the filmmakers double down and cast Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in the lead role.  Well color me surprised.  Faster has everything you might expect in the action/revenge genre -- a lot of guns, cool cars, shooting while driving fast in cool cars, and violent retribution enforced by a muscle-bound protagonist.What I wasn't expecting is how thoughtful and well-crafted the movie is.  Director George Tillman Jr. really takes the time to explore the price of revenge, the consequences of doing evil, and the possibility of redemption.  And none of it comes across as preachy or sentimental.  Moreover, the film is full of interesting characters. Johnson is excellent, exhibiting controlled rage as he methodically executes one creep after another.  He doesn't talk much, letting his eyes and facial expression tell his story.  Billy Bob Thornton plays a drug-addicted, loser cop trying to track down Johnson's character while keeping his crumbling family from falling apart.  There's an interesting villain, a hitman sent to stop the killing spree.  He's a complicated, ultra-disciplined, narcissistic adrenaline junkie with a host of psychological issues.The profound contrast with the blunt, single-mindedness of Johnson is entertaining. As the film nears its climax, each of these characters is forced to make a choice that determines his fate.  Solid movie all the way around.

That must have been difficult to come up with.  A completely unnecessary third-wheel-subplot is present, showing off a millionaire software developer assassin who has mastered yoga (seriously) and gets to shag Maggie Grace - whose role as hot girlfriend is so pointless it should have been uncredited - is hardly worth mentioning.After being released from prison, Driver jumps in the car set up by a P.I. acquaintance of his, drives to a local telemarketing office, and sprays some nerd's brain matter on the back of his cubicle.  If there is a better way to get me on the side of a guy embarking on a cross-country, revenge-filled murdering spree - which is tracked by Cop and his partner Cop with Breasts (Carla Gugino) - then I don't know of it; because everyone hates telemarketers.  Through flashbacks we learn that Driver's brother (and crew) were involved in a bank heist and later murdered for their score.  Up next: Death Wish Johnson!Flaws in character development abound, as very little is learned about Driver, but a ton of time is spent on Billy Bob's failed marriage, portly kid, and drug problem.  Each of the characters is transparently established as flawed, and the certainty of their eventual revelation makes tomorrow's sunrise doubtful.  The cinematography and limited special effects are both unremarkable.  Acting-wise, this film has the gusto of a professional cast already reading their next script; it never reaches the crescendo of expected excitement.  Evidently two decent car chases and a few head shots just wasn't enough to get the cast fully enthralled either.  I will say, however, that Johnson definitely steps outside his comfort zone, displaying what appeared to be genuine vulnerability to pair with already mastered anger.While disappointing, Faster is nonetheless in my beloved ""Death Wish,"" screw with me and I'll kill everyone you know, category.

I thought the best acting was by Billy Bob Thornton, with Dwayne Johnson in a close second.  The story was somewhat predictable at times and unpredictable at other times.

George Tillman he directed Soul Food & Men Of Honor good movies but he wasn't right for this movie.  Stars The Rock as Driver, Nilly Bob Thorton as Cop, Oliver Jackson Cohen as Killer, Moon Bloodgood  as Marina & Maggie Grace as Lily. Story is this guy Driver has gotten out of prison he's going after the people that killed his brother. He goes into an office & kills this telemarketer. He goes & kills this guy who makes snuff films. Cop who was in on it hires a hit man named Killer you don't buy this guy for second he looks like he belongs in a chick flick. After he kills the snuff director he has a shoot out with Killer that reminds me of Kill Switch. Killer isn't doing this you know to help secure him & his girlfriends future he does as a hobby for 1 Godd  a  mn  dollar. Were introduced to Cops ex wife Marina & we have some over dramatic garbage about taking their son to his baseball game she threatens custody. Killer goes & marries Lily & he promises he will quit being a hit man. But he has to finish job Driver has an ex girlfriend it's over dramatic BS between them. Driver finds the guy who killed his brother you have a lame fight in the bathroom that reminds me of SF Legend Of Chun Li. Driver stabs this guy like 2 times he goes down. He asks Driver please tell my son I love him & I'm sorry. Driver calls that guys son & says something bad happened to your dad. WHAT NOOOOOO! I would've had him do this instead "" No my job was to send you to he  'll  & I'm putting you there."" Here's a great piece of dialogue Cop is talking about what happened to the guy Driver stabbed Cop says it's a hunch he has his partner says ""Yeah so did Quasimoto hsve a hunch & look where that got him. These 2 didn't have a good interaction. Driver still has the cell phone that guys son called & tells him he will come after The Rock has an ok line he says ""You do what you need to do. But you better be sure cause it's a long dark road. It turns out that guy is still alive Driver goes to the hospital finishes the job. Lame shoot out between Cop & Driver. You have a bad car chase with Driver & Killer. Driver has a clear shot for Killers head but starts shooting out his tires which allows Killer to shoot him in the neck & apparently it can be stiched right up. Driver is listening to a church station on the radio & 1 guy that was there when his brother was killed was this traveling preacher he asks for forgiveness & for whatever reason I buy it. Driver spares him. Killer confronts Driver & he says why don't you take me serious. Cause you belong in a chick flick. Cop says he was in it all along shoots Driver in the back of the head & pays Killer 1 dollar. Driver has a metal plate in his head so he got up & he kills cop & Driver goes off into the sunset. I thought this was a bad movie & it has the same problem that a lot of action  movies suffer from today they try & make them a ""smart movie""  & they forget about the main reason you're watching THE ACTION! It's so pretentious it's not funny. George Tillman is a good director. They should've got an action director like Richard Donner, Renny Harlin or Mark L Lester. The Rock really doesn't do much. Billy Bob Thorton is there but he has nothing to do. Moon Bloodgood was awful. Oliver Jackson Cohenwill kill your love for action movies. Maggie Grace does nothing she did more in Taken.

1321842,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B0034G4OUO,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 4]","Finally after seemingly being stuck in kid movies working for ""The House of Mouse"", Dwayne Johnson returns to his action roots with ""Faster"".""Faster"" is the story of a man known as Driver (Dwayne Johnson), who upon being released from prison after serving ten years for a bank robbery instantly embarks upon a killing spree. However, these murders though seemingly random at first, are soon revealed to be linked to a tragic event ten years ago when Driver's older brother was murdered before his very eyes. Now, the only thing standing between Driver and those responsible for his pain is a burnt out cop (Billy Bob Thornton) and his temporary partner (Carla Gugino), and an assassin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) hired to kill him.Prior to watching this film I was anxious to see it simply for the fact that Dwayne Johnson is back in his action element. No more of the cutesy, kid-friendly fare that he'd been saddled with by Disney for the last few years. However, when watching the movie unfold, my feelings toward the film were fast becoming muddled by the proceedings.Sure, Dwayne was kicking butt and taking names in a way harkening back to the hard-hitting action flicks of the eighties and nineties (or even last year's ""The Expendables"" for that matter), which was fun for a little while. However, the movie quickly started feeling like the action was the only thing attempting to hold everything together.The problem was that the story was unbelievably thin, to the point of being nearly non-existent in fact. Just to be clear, this is not to say that I was expecting Oscar caliber storytelling by any means. I just think that there should have been enough going on to at least carry the movie and keep my attention for the 90 minute duration. Apparently, these ""lofty"" expectations were too high for this film, and I found myself becoming bored after approximately twenty minutes.To make matters worse, the film's action scenes were surprisingly repetitive after the first two or three kills. Sure, there were a couple that broke up the monotony, but for the most part Driver dispatches his deadly brand of revenge/justice in the same expedient manner every time. At first this callous and swift approach was startling and unexpected, but soon I was wishing for some variety and more excitement.With this sort of bare-bones approach combined with the repetitive nature of the action sequences, I should have known the story written by Tony Gayton (""Murder By Numbers"") and Joe Gayton (""Bulletproof"") was going to be weak from the get-go. However, I tried to keep an open mind and just enjoy it for the brainless entertainment that it was, but even that wasn't enough to save this movie.Now, as I've mentioned already, the main star in this lackluster actioner is Dwayne Johnson. For an actor making his return to his roots (so to speak) this would seem the ideal role; after all, there's not much for him to do other than be violent.The problem with this is that Dwayne has proven in previous films that he has acting chops and can bring much more to a character besides hulking mass. To me, while I had hoped this film would cement his return to action hero status, which it did in some respects, it also felt like a step backwards as the role seemed like a walk in the park that could have gone to a lesser talent.Alongside Dwayne is another actor who was wasted in the role literally and figuratively (his character's an addict) is Billy Bob Thornton (""Monster's Ball""). While I'm no fan of Billy Bob's by any means, I do recognize that he is a very good actor all the same. But his role here is clich&eacute;d and boring, and it appears that Billy Bob felt the same way, because I thought he was really phoning in his performance every step of the way.Lastly, actress Carla Gugino (""Sin City"") and actor Oliver Jackson-Cohen (""Going the Distance"") attempt to bring more to their painfully stereotypical roles of the female detective desperate to prove herself and an assassin that doesn't enjoy his work, respectively. However, as with their fellow cookie-cutter cut-out characters portrayed by Dwayne and Billy Bob, these two were given characters with nothing more than unoriginality to work with. So, no matter how hard they tried; their efforts were never enough to overcome the drivel on display.Now, while on the topic of the cast, I have a couple of thoughts as to why they all signed on to this ill-fated project.I'm sure the appeal to work on what could have been a very successful action film, especially one that would hardly be considered taxing on their dramatic talents, would be enticing for any actor or actress looking for an easy payday. But the least these cast members could have done was make sure the material was worthy of their attention, which it clearly was not.In closing, as you have no doubt surmised, this movie was an utter disappointment. The only bright point for the film is the fact that Dwayne Johnson was back in his element. ""Faster"" is filled with missed opportunities, unoriginality, repetition, and above all, boredom.""Faster"" is rated R for violence, language, and brief drug use.",2,A Poorly Executed Action

It is similar in plot toV for Vendetta,Man on FireandKill Bill- i.e. a revenge thriller. And, as a friend pointed out to me when watching the film, the dialogue is very sparse and the film is very basic.But to think this makes for a poor film is to be mistaken. Something about this film is raw and essential - the simple tale of a man on a mission to avenge his brother's death made all the more intense and powerful by the magnetism of Dwayne Johnson.One warning is that, if you are affected badly by emotionally strong films, then you may react like my friend's girlfriend and find it quite upsetting. Like the above mentioned revenge thrillers, it is not really the type of film for a romantic night on the couch!That said, it is a highly watchable film, which presents compelling human dilemnas - e.g. would you kill a remorseful priest who had helped kill your brother but changed his ways? Are people who kill for a living all remorseless, or does their conscience occasionally impact them?One last thing to mention is that the soundtrack matches the power of the film - one of the rare instances where a soundtrack matches the film, rather than getting in the way.Anyhow, to conclude: this film is one of my favourites and I even took my copy to give to my brother after seeing it - it's that good.

The first 5 or 10 minutes kind of confirm that this is going to be an exploitation movie, a straight revenge movie that could have been from the 80's, or something from Tarantino's list of obscure movies to watch.  However it turns out to be something not quite as straightforward, in no small part due to some terrific turns from the two main leads.Dwayne Johnson plays his best role in years here, as the guy just released from prison, who sets out at a brisk no-nonsense pace, to settle some scores.  The why he was in, the who he is after part gradually come together during the course of the movie, with a few flashbacks, along with some surprisingly well played backstories to the other characters in the movie.  While ""The Rock"" is playing his best - and perhaps not coincidentally his least verbose - role in years, Billy Bob Thornton also puts in a reliable turn as the cop on his case, who also has his own tortured background.If there's a misfire, it's the plot strand of the hitman hired to kill Johnson.  It's just not too essential to the story, although it does lead to the only brief car chase in the movie.  I should point out this is no ""Fast 5"" clone of babes and car chases - neither are in particular abundance here... the only thing it has in common is that the camera lavishes some enviable screen time on the muscle cars, and the rumble of Johnson's Chevelle SS acts as more of a voice for The Rock's character than he does.Clint Mansell's score of tinkling piano's mixed with some pounding synths as the behemoth Johnson ploughs towards his mark, is effectively backed up with some surprising song additions on the soundtrack.. from Iggy Pop to Kenny Rogers.All in all, it's a surprisingly stylishly put together flick - which while not the most surprising in the world, certainly is lifted by style and performances to the front of the pack of this ilk currently doing the rounds.  With the characters named by what they do or what they are (""Driver"", ""Cop"", ""Killer""), the emphasis on style and the music, the imperfect characters, one is almost tempted to see some homage to A Leone Western here - but in a good way.You may see the end coming, it might trod a well worn path, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and think it's better than its current competitors.

Sony preserved this revenge flick on a nice BD that captures how this film is meant to be seen. Plot description is as simple as the headings given to us with each character introduction: no names, just titles. A driver who bleeds his way through a revenge fest whilst being chased by a neurotic assassin and a washed up cop.The picture quality has various fluctuations but that is how it was filmed. Several cameras use the yellow tint heavily, others show a deliberate grain. The flashy filming and action edit cuts can upset some viewers, but the overall quality makes this a great presentation. The DTS was mixed excellently throughout the film, whether it is the nice music score/soundtrack, or Rock throttling that beautiful car or that Ruger going off like the canon it is. The special features are a mixed bag:* Alternate ending, 12:35 minutes. Optional director introduction. A much more action-packed head-to-head ending that carried with it some major flaws, but worth the watch. Once they cut this out that led to all of the following scenes being cut...* Deleted scenes, 10:43 minutes. All revolving around the change in how they present the ending and final twist(s). Moon Bloodgood got the shaft on this as these scenes were mostly hers, some of her grittiest acting to date. Director introduction to each is optional, with the menu manipulation making it somewhat amateurish in how they put it together (having to go backwards after each selection to actually see the scenes).* Criminals/Cops, 12:05 minutes. Talking heads and clip heavy, only one or two decent insights.* Guns, stunts, cars, 11:21 minutes. VERY worthy since it hits my three favorite topics in a film like this.* Animatics, 12:15 minutes. Skip it. Is a storyboard mix of scenes, uninteresting.* Movie IQ, the usual feature length trivia.Region coded A/B/C with English and Spanish subs only. If you are wondering where the big action scenes from the trailer and some of the cover art scenes went to - then you have to watch the alternate ending (as I was waiting for the big head-on scene the whole movie and never got it).

Part of that charisma is embedded in a winning charm; here you have a hulking man-brute figure who can disarm and overpower others through his sheer size and presence but the moment he flashes that awesome smile one will be just as disarmed and overpowered.""Faster"" is an old-fashioned 1970s revenge exploitation thriller starring Johnson.  In the movie he plays a fairly one note character, a bit of a man-child, who was with his brother during a crime when his brother was betrayed and killed in grisly fashion.  After getting out of prison he immediately goes on a killing spree, violently and viciously murdering his former cohorts in crime.  But he is somewhat of a changed man as he isn't murdering anyone else, just the no good sons-of-b**ches who turned turncoat on he and his brother.  The story unfolds in slices for the viewer as he is pursued by police on his murderous crime spree and character depth is developed by our getting to see his backstory moments as they are peeled away, sliced from memory, and through brief moments of his listening to a Christian desert revivalist gospel sermon.  At movie's end he has done what he believes needed doing, but has he changed?This grim piece of cinema only finds only slight bits of humor in the visage and affectations of Billy Bob Thornton's washed up, almost ready to retire detective.

Dwayne Johnson's laconic hero may be merciless in distributing his own brand of justice, but he is not totally inhuman, as the back story about his past in the film's mid-section reveals. Some reviewers may call ""Faster"" an action flick, and directed by George Tillman Jr. (""Men of Honor""), the film has several car chases and shoot-outs, but it is not exactly about actions, or stunts, but about the characters. You just can't expect a ""The Fast and The Furious""-like, action-packed film here.Dwayne Johnson is convincing as the avenger refusing to forget his past, and Billy Bob Thornton turns in a solid performance as a drug-addicted detective struggling within himself, but the filmmakers' worthy attempt at a character-driven drama is undermined by the sluggish pace and too many supporting characters, some of which are out of place here.

I happened to get Showtime as Faster, starring Dwayne Johnson, was beginning.  Now, Dwayne Johnson is generally known to most people as The Rock.  That's certainly how I know him from his long years in wrestling to his first acting role in The Mummy Returns.  Anyway, I decided to watch the first few minutes of the movie and then hit the sack.  Instead, I ended up watching the entire film and enjoying it, too.Dwayne plays a character known as the Driver.  He was the driver for his brother during a bank robbery.  Later, the entire crew was killed by others who'd been hired to steal the money from them.  The Driver was shot in the head, but he managed to live.  He then spent ten years in jail for the bank robbery.  When he finally gets out, he goes after the guys who murdered his brother, killing each of them with no emotion and in front of others.  He only cares about revenge and not the final outcome of his bloody mission.The unknown man who originally sent in the killers to wipe out the crew hires a professional assassin to go after Dwayne Johnson, and this guy is damn good.  The thing is the Rock is better and he knows it.  Because of that and his past history, you begin to see the assassin as a human being and to understand where he's coming from.  For some strange reason you don't want to see either him or the Rock die at the end.As the Driver tracks each killer down and administers justice for what they did, he gets more intuned with the hatred that has fueled his life for so long and realizes it's destroying him.  Can he change his need for vengeance before he completes his mission?  You have to see the movie to find out.Billy Bob Thornton plays the cop who's after the Driver.  This a great performance by Billy Bob, especially when he's dealing with his son and the wife he's separated from.Tom Berringer even has a small role as the warden of the prison.Surprisingly, I really liked the movie.  The stunt driving was excellent, the cold-blooded killing was in your face and totally realistic, the lead character was someone you eventually learned to care about and wanted to see still alive by the end of the film, and the supporting actors were all excellent in their own particular roles.  There were even a few twists I didn't see coming and caught me completely off guard.  I did guess who the head killer was, only because that's how I would have done the script myself.This a nice little gem of a movie that isn't pretentious and caught me by surprise.  I suspect I'll purchase it for my movie collection before Christmas.

As the previous reviewer stated, The Rock mostly skates through the movie Mad, Distraught, and the actions scenes are decent at best. When there is action, anyway...Also agreeing with the previous reviewer, I think this is the right type of movie for The Rock to be in, but there needs to be more content, action & more of The Rock kicking butt!The Rock needs to do more Jason Stathem type of movies... A LOT MORE ACTION...The Car that The Rock drives in the movie ROCKS!!!!!!!!
