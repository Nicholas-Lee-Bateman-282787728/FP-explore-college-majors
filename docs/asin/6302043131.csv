Unfortunately, little remains available to the masses on video from this era (even the legendary TAMI Show sadly exists in mutilated form) and the racial policies of the time limited such appearances on American television. Jackie Wilson's 1964 Shindig appearance thankfully survives. This is a truly breathtaking performance that you cannot watch just once (especially his acrobatic finale) and his stirring ballads &quot;No Pity in the Naked City&quot; and &quot;Danny Boy.&quot;This is a classic! See what you missed at the Apollo Theater.",5,One of the best 60s soul performances on video!,1002844800,"10 12, 2001",2001,644,"['classic', 'years', 'R', 'amp', 'B', 'were', 'legendary', 'live', 'perfomances', 'as', 'well', 'recorded', 'music', 'Unfortunately', 'little', 'available', 'masses', 'video', 'era', 'even', 'legendary', 'TAMI', 'Show', 'sadly', 'mutilated', 'form', 'racial', 'policies', 'time', 'limited', 'such', 'appearances', 'American', 'television', 'Jackie', 'Wilson', '1964', 'Shindig', 'appearance', 'thankfully', 'truly', 'breathtaking', 'performance', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'just', 'once', 'especially', 'acrobatic', 'finale', 'stirring', 'ballads', 'quot', 'Pity', 'Naked', 'City', 'quot', 'quot', 'Danny', 'Boy.', 'quot', 'classic', 'See', 'what', 'missed', 'Apollo', 'Theater']",N/A

Both men were unafraid to go over the top and did so fearlessly. Jackie's story is far more tragic however; he deserved to be  as big as Elvis but instead died--like Elvis--too early. In live  performance he was said to be even the superior of James Brown  when it  came to stagecraft and dancing and I belive it. But Shindig's compilation  does not fully do service to the man. They simply didn't film very well. He  is often placed on pedestals--thus severely limiting his moves--and the  camera tries focusing too much on the dorky looking back-up dancers rather  than closely capturing Jackie's every move. If you got Jackie Wilson  performing in front of you, don't clutter the stage up. Shindig is said to  be the best of the '60's RnR shows--if so how rancid were the rest? Jackie  doesn't quite work up the level of energy that would arise from a continous  performance--these are isolated three minute appearances, so momentum  doesn't truly build up. Additionally, his sterling performance of  &quot;Danny Boy&quot; is not of the complete song. It's either been edited  or Jackie was told to simply sing a short version(To make room for bad  commercials like the one included in this video perhaps?). Unfortunate. So  why, after having spent so much time picking holes, do I still greatly  recommend this video? Because if, like me, you've fallen in love with this  magnificent singer's voice, you'll want to collect every piece of video  with him on it, and this video seems to be the only one around. To  paraphrase Van Morrison, I'm in heaven when Jackie Wilson walks onstage.",4,Jackie deserves slightly better,959040000,"05 23, 2000",2000,1687,"['Jackie', 'Wilson', 'was', 'Olivier', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'fantastic', 'technician', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'artist', 'men', 'were', 'unafraid', 'go', 'top', 'did', 'so', 'fearlessly', 'Jackie', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'tragic', 'however', 'deserved', 'be', 'as', 'big', 'Elvis', 'instead', 'died', 'Elvis', 'too', 'early', 'live', 'performance', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'even', 'superior', 'James', 'Brown', 'when', 'came', 'stagecraft', 'dancing', 'belive', 'Shindig', 'compilation', 'not', 'fully', 'do', 'service', 'man', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'very', 'well', 'often', 'placed', 'pedestals', 'thus', 'severely', 'limiting', 'moves', 'camera', 'focusing', 'too', 'much', 'dorky', 'looking', 'back-up', 'dancers', 'rather', 'closely', 'capturing', 'Jackie', 'move', 'got', 'Jackie', 'Wilson', 'performing', 'front', 'do', ""n't"", 'clutter', 'stage', 'up', 'Shindig', 'said', 'be', 'best', ""'60"", 'RnR', 'shows', 'how', 'rancid', 'were', 'rest', 'Jackie', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'up', 'level', 'energy', 'would', 'arise', 'continous', 'performance', 'are', 'isolated', 'three', 'minute', 'appearances', 'so', 'momentum', ""n't"", 'truly', 'build', 'up', 'Additionally', 'sterling', 'performance', 'quot', 'Danny', 'Boy', 'quot', 'not', 'complete', 'song', 'been', 'edited', 'Jackie', 'was', 'told', 'simply', 'sing', 'short', 'version', 'make', 'room', 'bad', 'commercials', 'one', 'included', 'video', 'perhaps', 'Unfortunate', 'So', 'why', 'having', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'picking', 'holes', 'do', 'still', 'greatly', 'recommend', 'video', ""'ve"", 'fallen', 'love', 'magnificent', 'singer', 'voice', ""'ll"", 'want', 'collect', 'piece', 'video', 'video', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'around', 'paraphrase', 'Van', 'Morrison', ""'m"", 'heaven', 'when', 'Jackie', 'Wilson', 'onstage']",N/A
