1084782,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000S0SYI2,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[3, 5]","The brothers Wilson (Luke and Owen) star, direct, and wrote this comedy con tale about the self-titled entrepreneur (Luke) who takes his beautiful girlfriend, Doreen (Eva Mendez) for granted and finds unconventional ways to make ends meet.At the beginning we find him literally hooking up with his neighbor, Razz (Jacob Vargas), taking an RUV to the border to make fake ID's for entering Mexicans who want to be naturalized without government assistance.  Rationalizing that they are the ""Ellis Island of the Southwest,"" Wendell is quickly caught and taken to Huntsville Prison where reform includes educating himself into a new livelihood.  Once parolled he has to start out straight--from the bottom that is.  His hotel entrepreneurial destiny is to be a worker at The Shady Acres, more of a retirement home than a hotel.  There he's met his match with head nurse, Neil King (Owen), whose martinet sensibilities are almost as pronounced as his dishonesty and taste for elder abuse.At the center, Skip and Mr. Summers are two residents who have nothing to lose by siding with Wendell. Between the threat of being framed for Neil King's crimes and being mauled by Doreen's current boyfriend, Dave (Will Farrell), Wendell shows that reform has never been made more difficult.  Befriending a resourceful retiree, Mr. Nasher (Kris Kristopherson), he has a plan to try to get everything back in his life.The movie is often philosophical in import, even when the mischief is going full throttle.  (Nasher says with clarity that he isn't going back home because when one gets old, ""Yesterday, today, and tomorrow"" are in the same room.)  Freewheelin' fun is met with a nice message about living life to the fullest and the usefulness of the elderly.  With a fairy tale element, it's basically a fun no-brainer comedy.  As one character says, ""Sometimes things don't turn out perfectly; they turn out well.""  The same could be said for evaluating the movie.",3,King Con,1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,1950,"['brothers', 'Wilson', 'Luke', 'Owen', 'star', 'direct', 'wrote', 'comedy', 'con', 'tale', 'self-titled', 'entrepreneur', 'Luke', 'who', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'Doreen', 'Eva', 'Mendez', 'granted', 'unconventional', 'ways', 'make', 'ends', 'meet.At', 'beginning', 'find', 'literally', 'hooking', 'up', 'neighbor', 'Razz', 'Jacob', 'Vargas', 'taking', 'RUV', 'border', 'make', 'fake', 'ID', 'entering', 'Mexicans', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'naturalized', 'government', 'assistance', 'Rationalizing', 'are', 'Ellis', 'Island', 'Southwest', 'Wendell', 'quickly', 'caught', 'taken', 'Huntsville', 'Prison', 'where', 'reform', 'educating', 'new', 'livelihood', 'Once', 'parolled', 'start', 'out', 'straight', 'bottom', 'hotel', 'entrepreneurial', 'destiny', 'be', 'worker', 'Shady', 'Acres', 'more', 'retirement', 'home', 'hotel', 'met', 'match', 'head', 'nurse', 'Neil', 'King', 'Owen', 'martinet', 'sensibilities', 'are', 'almost', 'as', 'pronounced', 'dishonesty', 'taste', 'elder', 'center', 'Skip', 'Mr.', 'Summers', 'are', 'two', 'residents', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'lose', 'siding', 'Wendell', 'threat', 'being', 'framed', 'Neil', 'King', 'crimes', 'being', 'mauled', 'Doreen', 'current', 'boyfriend', 'Dave', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'Wendell', 'reform', 'never', 'been', 'made', 'more', 'difficult', 'Befriending', 'resourceful', 'retiree', 'Mr.', 'Nasher', 'Kris', 'Kristopherson', 'plan', 'try', 'get', 'everything', 'back', 'life.The', 'movie', 'often', 'philosophical', 'import', 'even', 'when', 'mischief', 'going', 'full', 'throttle', 'Nasher', 'clarity', ""n't"", 'going', 'back', 'home', 'when', 'one', 'old', 'Yesterday', 'today', 'tomorrow', 'are', 'same', 'room', 'Freewheelin', 'fun', 'met', 'nice', 'message', 'living', 'life', 'fullest', 'usefulness', 'elderly', 'fairy', 'tale', 'element', 'basically', 'fun', 'no-brainer', 'comedy', 'one', 'character', 'Sometimes', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'perfectly', 'turn', 'out', 'well', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'evaluating', 'movie']",The Wendell Baker Story

It was written by Luke Wilson, and co-directed by him, and his older brother Andrew Wilson (who starred in Whip It, another must see movie) Andrew really handled the directing, Luke worked with the actors. Speaking of which what a fantastic cast. Owen Wilson (yep the third talented Wilson brother.) plays a creepy dude to perfect comic affect. Eva Mendes shines as always, and the real joy in this film comes from the amazing performances of the supporting cast, Eddie Griffin, Seymour Cassel, Kris Kristofferson, and Harry Dean Stanton. The movie does sort of amble along. It's leisure pace is actually refreshing. This is the type of movie that while you watch you find yourself guessing where its going, though it never falls into any cliches of plot.It really is a very well written movie. Andrews direction is uneven at times. There are some great shots, and well done passages. While somehow it does seem to drag in places. Don't get me wrong this is nit-picky at best, because this film is a must own DVD for anyone who likes great movies. BTW speaking of great movies with Luke Wilson in it if you haven't seen ""Henry Poole is Here"" then order that one too!I just recently saw the Wilson brothers first film the truly brilliant ""Bottle Rocket"" directed by Wes Anderson. That movie reminds me of Wendell Baker in that it also has a odd pace that sneaks up on you, and after you have watched it you realize that it was a masterpiece. Oh one last thing the Wendell Baker DVD has several great extras including a fun bit with Luke, Andrew, Seymour, and Harry.

1084789,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000S0SYI2,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 5]","***1/2As played by Luke Wilson, Wendell Baker is the kind of character authors like to refer to as a ""lovable rogue"" - a smooth-talking scam artist with a tongue as nimble as the pen of a scribe (to borrow a phrase from scripture, if I may be so bold).  The trouble is that a good-hearted guy can run afoul of the law for only so long before he risks losing the woman he loves (Eva Mendes) and before he is finally forced into taking a long, hard look at his life.  Thus, once he's paroled from prison, Wendell decides to go straight by taking a job at a retirement home (he's been duped into believing that this is a first step on the road to a career in hotel management) run by a sadistic administrator (Owen Wilson) and his toadying staff.  There's a little of the feel of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" as the con man leads the put-upon inmates of the ""asylum"" in a well-coordinated rebellion against their oppressors.The chief attraction of ""The Wendell Baker Story"" is the opportunity it affords us of seeing the Wilson brothers appearing together in the same movie - and what a treat it turns out to be.  Luke has written a script filled with the kind of dry, wry wit that has been the hallmark of both of their performances over the years, and their scenes together crackle with understated cynicism and humor (Luke co-directed the feature with yet another brother, Andrew, making this a family affair in the fullest sense of the term).  The movie is also blessed with an amazing team of supporting players, including Harry Dean Stanton and Seymour Cassel as spry oldsters who find a supportive helpmate in Wendell Baker; Kris Kristofferson as a mysterious, stoic resident who is harboring a carefully guarded secret about his past; Will Ferrell as the grocery store owner who is Wendell`s chief rival for his now ex-girlfriend`s affections; and Eddie Griffin who serves as chief henchman for the home`s scalawag of a director.Their performances and the laidback tone of the humor compensate for the occasional dry spots and the fact that the movie itself doesn't really add up to all that much when all is said and done.",3,not a barn-burner but sweet and witty,1229212800,"12 14, 2008",2008,2134,"['***1/2As', 'played', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Wendell', 'Baker', 'kind', 'character', 'authors', 'refer', 'lovable', 'rogue', 'smooth-talking', 'scam', 'artist', 'tongue', 'as', 'nimble', 'pen', 'scribe', 'borrow', 'phrase', 'scripture', 'may', 'be', 'so', 'bold', 'trouble', 'good-hearted', 'guy', 'can', 'run', 'afoul', 'law', 'only', 'so', 'long', 'losing', 'woman', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'finally', 'forced', 'taking', 'long', 'hard', 'look', 'life', 'Thus', 'once', 'paroled', 'prison', 'Wendell', 'go', 'straight', 'taking', 'job', 'retirement', 'home', 'been', 'duped', 'believing', 'first', 'step', 'road', 'career', 'hotel', 'management', 'run', 'sadistic', 'administrator', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'toadying', 'staff', 'little', 'feel', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'con', 'man', 'put-upon', 'inmates', 'asylum', 'well-coordinated', 'rebellion', 'oppressors.The', 'chief', 'attraction', 'Wendell', 'Baker', 'Story', 'opportunity', 'seeing', 'Wilson', 'brothers', 'appearing', 'together', 'same', 'movie', 'what', 'treat', 'out', 'be', 'Luke', 'written', 'script', 'filled', 'kind', 'dry', 'wry', 'wit', 'been', 'hallmark', 'performances', 'years', 'scenes', 'together', 'crackle', 'understated', 'cynicism', 'humor', 'Luke', 'co-directed', 'feature', 'yet', 'brother', 'Andrew', 'making', 'family', 'affair', 'fullest', 'sense', 'term', 'movie', 'also', 'blessed', 'amazing', 'team', 'supporting', 'players', 'including', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'Seymour', 'Cassel', 'spry', 'oldsters', 'who', 'find', 'supportive', 'helpmate', 'Wendell', 'Baker', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'mysterious', 'stoic', 'resident', 'who', 'harboring', 'carefully', 'guarded', 'secret', 'past', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'grocery', 'store', 'owner', 'who', 'Wendell', 's', 'chief', 'rival', 'now', 'ex-girlfriend', 's', 'affections', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', 'who', 'as', 'chief', 'henchman', 'home', 's', 'scalawag', 'director.Their', 'performances', 'laidback', 'tone', 'humor', 'compensate', 'occasional', 'dry', 'spots', 'fact', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'up', 'that', 'much', 'when', 'said', 'done']",The Wendell Baker Story
1084790,A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B000S0SYI2,"Rudy Palma ""The Writing Fiend""","[1, 2]","Directing with his brother Andrew, Luke Wilson plays the title role in ""The Wendell Baker Story,"" recently released quietly on DVD. A non-stop romp of action-packed comedy with strong undercurrents of pathos that blend surprisingly well, the film has a broad range of appeal for one that only took residence in 17 theaters last year.Baker is a cavalier ""entrepreneur"" who makes his living selling fake identification to immigrants on the Texan border with his buddy Reyes, played by Jacob Vargas. Able to sweet talk his way out of just about anything, he always manages to convince his girlfriend Doreen, portrayed by Eva Mendes, that he deserves another chance. As far as the fact that his occupation technically entails criminal activity, he is frank: ""If there was a job I could do, I would do it!""A sting operation soon folds Wendell Baker International, and that means prison time, despite fine legal representation.""Can't I get deported?,"" he asks his lawyer.""Wendell, you're a US citizen!""""Damn it!""Upon being paroled from prison he gets work at a state-run residential retirement hotel, working under the supervision of wisecracking conniver Neil King and his henchman McTeague, played by Owen Wilson and Eddie Griffin respectively. It is immediately clear to Wendell that neither man cares in the least about the elderly residents, but he is in position to do anything about it. Laying low, he develops a camaraderie with Boyd and Skip, portrayed respectively by acting legends Seymour Cassel and Harry Dean Stanton.Observing Baker as a benevolent spirit, the two decide to keep him around: ""Maybe he can get us laid.""The three team up to uncover the truth behind the suspicious goings-on surrounding the hotel, specifically the extradition of numerous residents to a surreptitious location, and to help Baker win back Doreen, who has finally moved on and developed a steady relationship with moody grocer Dave Bix, played Will Ferrell. The three soon realize they have their work cut out for them. Employing the help of Wendell's old friend Reyes and a crusty, tight-lipped resident named Nasher, played by the inimitable Kris Kristofferson, they embark on their journey.Wilson, who wrote the script, clearly has a ball playing an archetypal lead character which in a way represents a male fantasy - transgressing with a devil may care attitude, repenting and finding spiritual renewal, and then stopping at nothing to win back the girl. Perhaps inevitably, as a result of this several clich&eacute;s arise, and a great deal of the dialogue is sappy and smacks of being ""written.""In spite of its implausibility, the film's good points outweigh the bad. If not particularly believable, it is a movie filled with laughs but also, importantly, a great deal of heart. Wilson gives each character depth and nuance, even Mendes' spot as the typically one-dimensional girlfriend, giving the actors the green light to seize the film and have fun with it. Kristofferson is particularly touching - his final scene alone makes the film worth a rental, not to mention the beautiful Texan scenery.A zealous, zany, southern-fried flick, ""The Wendell Baker Story"" is on par with the likes of ""Wedding Crashers"" or ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" in terms of quality buddy comedies of the 2000's. Those looking for laughs without the intellectual insults will be pleased.",4,"Zany, Southern-Fried Comedy (3.5 Stars)",1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,3358,"['Directing', 'brother', 'Andrew', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'title', 'role', 'Wendell', 'Baker', 'Story', 'recently', 'released', 'quietly', 'DVD', 'non-stop', 'romp', 'action-packed', 'comedy', 'strong', 'undercurrents', 'pathos', 'blend', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'film', 'broad', 'range', 'appeal', 'one', 'only', 'took', 'residence', '17', 'theaters', 'last', 'year.Baker', 'cavalier', 'entrepreneur', 'who', 'living', 'selling', 'fake', 'identification', 'immigrants', 'Texan', 'border', 'buddy', 'Reyes', 'played', 'Jacob', 'Vargas', 'Able', 'sweet', 'talk', 'way', 'just', 'anything', 'always', 'convince', 'girlfriend', 'Doreen', 'portrayed', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'chance', 'As', 'far', 'fact', 'occupation', 'technically', 'criminal', 'activity', 'frank', 'was', 'job', 'could', 'do', 'would', 'do', 'sting', 'operation', 'soon', 'folds', 'Wendell', 'Baker', 'International', 'prison', 'time', 'fine', 'legal', 'representation', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'deported', 'lawyer', 'Wendell', ""'re"", 'US', 'citizen', 'Damn', 'being', 'paroled', 'prison', 'work', 'state-run', 'residential', 'retirement', 'hotel', 'working', 'supervision', 'wisecracking', 'conniver', 'Neil', 'King', 'henchman', 'McTeague', 'played', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', 'respectively', 'immediately', 'clear', 'Wendell', 'man', 'least', 'elderly', 'residents', 'position', 'do', 'anything', 'Laying', 'low', 'camaraderie', 'Boyd', 'Skip', 'portrayed', 'respectively', 'acting', 'legends', 'Seymour', 'Cassel', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton.Observing', 'Baker', 'benevolent', 'spirit', 'two', 'decide', 'keep', 'around', 'Maybe', 'can', 'get', 'laid', 'three', 'team', 'up', 'uncover', 'truth', 'suspicious', 'goings-on', 'surrounding', 'hotel', 'specifically', 'extradition', 'numerous', 'residents', 'surreptitious', 'location', 'help', 'Baker', 'win', 'back', 'Doreen', 'who', 'finally', 'moved', 'developed', 'steady', 'relationship', 'moody', 'grocer', 'Dave', 'Bix', 'played', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'three', 'soon', 'realize', 'have', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'Employing', 'help', 'Wendell', 'old', 'friend', 'Reyes', 'crusty', 'tight-lipped', 'resident', 'named', 'Nasher', 'played', 'inimitable', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'embark', 'journey.Wilson', 'who', 'wrote', 'script', 'clearly', 'ball', 'playing', 'archetypal', 'lead', 'character', 'way', 'male', 'fantasy', 'transgressing', 'devil', 'may', 'care', 'attitude', 'repenting', 'finding', 'spiritual', 'renewal', 'then', 'stopping', 'nothing', 'win', 'back', 'girl', 'Perhaps', 'inevitably', 'result', 'several', 'clich', 'eacute', 'arise', 'great', 'deal', 'dialogue', 'sappy', 'smacks', 'being', 'written', 'spite', 'implausibility', 'film', 'good', 'points', 'outweigh', 'bad', 'not', 'particularly', 'believable', 'movie', 'filled', 'laughs', 'also', 'importantly', 'great', 'deal', 'heart', 'Wilson', 'character', 'depth', 'nuance', 'even', 'Mendes', 'spot', 'typically', 'one-dimensional', 'girlfriend', 'giving', 'actors', 'green', 'light', 'seize', 'film', 'have', 'fun', 'Kristofferson', 'particularly', 'touching', 'final', 'scene', 'alone', 'film', 'rental', 'not', 'mention', 'beautiful', 'Texan', 'scenery.A', 'zealous', 'zany', 'southern-fried', 'flick', 'Wendell', 'Baker', 'Story', 'par', 'likes', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', '40-Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'terms', 'quality', 'buddy', 'comedies', '2000', 'looking', 'laughs', 'intellectual', 'insults', 'will', 'be', 'pleased']",The Wendell Baker Story

1084792,A19DW3VKM5KKYB,B000S0SYI2,TheBandit,"[8, 13]","Luke Wilson is a likable actor, though it's easy to see why his brother Owen became a bigger star.  There's something very unique about Owen's delivery and overall persona; there's an off-kilter spin on his line readings that has kept many of his performances interesting.  Luke, on the other hand, trades in mainly on easy-going geniality - he generally plays a similar character every time out.  But given the right role  (""Bottle Rocket"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" come to mind) he is very effective and hints at greater dramatic potential.Apparently those likable traits don't cross over into his writing and directing skills.  In fact, the parties responsible for allowing him to turn his nearly incoherent screenplay for ""The Wendell Baker Story"" into a movie shouldn't be allowed to make such decisions.  This is a vanity project - and a particularly bad one, at that.  To be fair, Luke co-directed this movie with his brother Andrew (Future Man in ""Bottle Rocket"") and combined they appear to have the directorial talent of...well, pretty much the average person who has never directed a movie before.  There is no sense of visual style whatsoever.  The prevailing choice for staging dialogue scenes seems to have been: stick the camera as close to the actor's face as possible, and make sure he/she is poorly lit.  Seriously, what kind of movie manages to make Eva Mendes look old and haggard?There is a TON of talent assembled in this movie's cast:  besides Eva Mendes and Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson is on board in a supporting role, along with Kris Kristofferson, Harry Dean Stanton, Seymour Cassel, Will Ferrell, Eddie Griffin - and not one is utilized to good effect!I guess Luke Wilson must have accumulated quite a few famous friends, because I don't know why most of those actors would've even agreed to participate in something so amatuerish.  The screenplay is credited solely to Luke, and can't imagine it being sloppier if he tried.  The basic story concerns a guy (Wendell Baker) who helps illegal aliens obtain fake IDs in order to work in the U.S.  After getting busted for this, Wendell serves some jail time during which he develops an interest in the hotel industry.  Upon release, he is assigned to work at a retirement home.  Simple as it sounds, that part of the story manages to take up the first hour or so of the movie.  Oh, and Wendell's girlfriend (Mendes) dumps him after he goes to jail, and naturally he intends to win her back.  Some nonsense about the elderly inhabitants of the retirement center being bilked out of their social security benefits enters into the plot during it's final act - by then, it's too late.  I didn't care about anyone in the movie; the cast of characters is uniformly, though unintentionally, lacking in sympathetic traits.  Even though the running time is a relatively brisk 100 minutes, it felt like twice that.Prior to viewing this movie, I was puzzled as to why it never received a theatrical release and was basically shelved for two years.
