1186174,AFNG8O2DXRCUV,B001EOQWNK,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","Even though this series is targeted at young teens, it attracted more younger kids (as young as 4 year old) because of supporting cast characters like Jackson and Oliver, doing silly things that make kids laugh and brighten their day. But even parents and grandparents who grew up loving the sitcoms in the spirit of ""I Love Lucy"" would love Hannah Montana the TV show.  Also rarely do you find a TV series where practically every episode showcases a new song, and the song goes from good to darn good, from being meaningful (lifting young kids spirit) to light-hearted romance, to cute music, and finally in later seasons lyrics focus more seriously on growing pains and inner feelings.Disney should treasure this show/franchise for a while (and maybe reboot it in 50 years!). It's not likely anytime soon to repeat the feat of what this TV show able to attract and impact.

1186179,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B001EOQWNK,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[15, 18]","Within weeks of the release of the wondrous Walt Disney Treasure DVD set, ""The Mickey Mouse Club Presents Annette,"" here we have her far more opulent descendant of teen stardom, ""Hannah Montana"" in its first full-season collection.It's not like you can't turn on Disney Channel and see a multitude of ""Hannah"" shows at will, but they tend to be clustered without sequence, so it's a different experience to see each show one after the other without promos and other network clutter that even clogs the occasional series marathon.Like ""The Monkees,"" when the furor fades and the songs fall from the charts, the show itself is left to stand on its own. While no one pretends this is ""30 Rock"" or ""Frasier,"" the ""Hannah"" series is a capable effort, with Miley Cyrus carrying virtually every scene with timing and confidence that develops somewhat over the episodes. What also becomes clear is the comic frenzy of Jason Earles as her brother, Jackson. Earles is actually older than he looks and his skill really comes through in the polished slapstick.Each episode's title is a wordplay of some musical reference (""Miley Get Your Gun,"" ""Good Golly, Miss Dolly,"" etc.). The first few shows, which set up the premise, don't get as much airplay and are interesting to watch because, as in many early series episodes, the characters are not developed and the cast is getting used to the material and each other.  It would have been nice to have some audio commentary by this highly accessible cast. Instead there are episodes with a few inserted comments from Miley culled from other interviews called ""Hannah's Highlights.""The Disney Channel Games kickoff episode and a vignette with Miley and Billy Ray Cyrus on their home turf round out the extras. The ""Games"" segment would be almost sure to be a fun thing for kids to watch a decade from now to see which stars they can remember and what a big deal it all seemed to be at the time.It would be nice to see more of the Disney Channel shows get this kind of treatment, especially the very entertaining ""Corey in the House,"" which is now out of production.",4,Nice to see all the episodes in one collection,1227571200,"11 25, 2008",2008,2099,"['weeks', 'release', 'wondrous', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Treasure', 'DVD', 'set', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'Presents', 'Annette', 'here', 'have', 'far', 'more', 'opulent', 'descendant', 'teen', 'stardom', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'first', 'full-season', 'collection.It', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'turn', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'see', 'multitude', 'Hannah', 'will', 'tend', 'be', 'clustered', 'sequence', 'different', 'experience', 'see', 'show', 'one', 'other', 'promos', 'other', 'network', 'clutter', 'even', 'clogs', 'occasional', 'series', 'Monkees', 'when', 'furor', 'fades', 'songs', 'fall', 'charts', 'show', 'left', 'stand', 'own', 'one', '30', 'Rock', 'Frasier', 'Hannah', 'series', 'capable', 'effort', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'carrying', 'virtually', 'scene', 'timing', 'confidence', 'somewhat', 'episodes', 'What', 'also', 'clear', 'comic', 'frenzy', 'Jason', 'Earles', 'brother', 'Jackson', 'Earles', 'actually', 'older', 'skill', 'really', 'polished', 'slapstick.Each', 'episode', 'title', 'wordplay', 'musical', 'reference', 'Miley', 'Get', 'Your', 'Gun', 'Good', 'Golly', 'Miss', 'Dolly', 'etc.', 'first', 'few', 'shows', 'set', 'up', 'premise', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', 'airplay', 'are', 'interesting', 'watch', 'because', 'many', 'early', 'series', 'episodes', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'developed', 'cast', 'getting', 'used', 'material', 'other', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'audio', 'commentary', 'highly', 'accessible', 'cast', 'Instead', 'are', 'episodes', 'few', 'inserted', 'comments', 'Miley', 'culled', 'other', 'interviews', 'called', 'Hannah', 'Highlights', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'Games', 'kickoff', 'episode', 'vignette', 'Miley', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'Cyrus', 'home', 'turf', 'round', 'out', 'extras', 'Games', 'segment', 'would', 'be', 'almost', 'sure', 'be', 'fun', 'thing', 'kids', 'watch', 'decade', 'now', 'see', 'can', 'remember', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'seemed', 'be', 'time.It', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'get', 'kind', 'treatment', 'especially', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Corey', 'House', 'now', 'production']",N/A

However, I simply never really enjoyed ""Hannah Montana"" very much. Albeit once or twice there were a couple of jokes that left me laughing hysterically, for the most part the premise of this comedy bores me. I am sorry to the creators or fans of this program, but I felt it was a bit overrated. While everybody around me was falling in love with Hannah Montana, I chose to back out of the trend, and when I went to a summer camp attended by a group of Hannah Montana fanatics, when I said that I did not enjoy the series they looked at me as though I were some sort of communist. I loathe the Disney Channel (however, I did enjoy quite a few classic animated Disney films; as a matter of fact, ever since I watched ""Bambi"" when I was six years old deer have been my favorite animals) and find their comedies corny. I like series revolving around regular people; no superheroes or mad scientists or adventurers or mythological creatures or anything, and every time they attempt to produce a series of that genre it comes out a bit campy.

Emily Osment, comes a long way from being Haley Joel Osment sister to Lily Truscott on the show.  Emily Osment looks like she was twelve years old in the show, what's her secret.  Emily Osment has the greatest resemblance of Heather Locklear and Zoey 101's Jamie Lynn Spears on the show.  She looks like more like a model than a actress in the show.  Miley Cyrus with or without the blonde wig she does look like Britney Spears and Hilary Duff all at once.  Miley Cyrus is like Lizzie Mcguire with a southern accent and her voice reminds me of Reba McEntire's character Reba Hart on the hit show Reba.  Even in the show the last two seasons, she sounds like Peri Gilpin's character Roz Doyle from Frasier and the third season she sounds like Reba McEntire's character Reba Hart on Reba.  That's who she sounds like, she is an excellent singer and probably a lot bigger than Britney Spears pretty soon.
