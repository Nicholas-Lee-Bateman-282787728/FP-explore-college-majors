The documentary footage, the still photographs and, of course, the men interviewed make this very compelling. But throughout the narrative the producers spliced in endless footage of modern-day re-enactors. The sense of viewing the past is broken every time they did it and they did it a lot. Why do I want to watch some modern-day young guy dressed up it WWI kit and playing at war? I was very disappointed when I saw The History Channel had a hand in making this it became obvious, because the History Channel does exactly the same thing. That's why I never watch The History Channel. There is no shortage of film and still photography from the Great War. There was no reason to do this except someone must think if it isn't in color the audience will switch it off. That's nonsense, of course. I would gladly have given this five stars if they had just thrown all the re-enactor footage in the trash. So, bottom line: It's worth watching, absolutely. But they added elements that weren't needed. That drooped it down to three stars for me.

There is something both eloquent and appalling in that, as we approach the 100th anniversary of the start of `the war to end all wars.'  The BBC taped these interviews in the late 90s, in anticipation of the 90th anniversary of Armistice Day (November 11, 1918).  Time was running out for the survivors of the Great War -  infantry soldiers (volunteers and conscripts), officers, sailors, pilots, nurses, medics, armament factory workers, wives and family members.  Those interviewed are 'old parties' - in their late 90s, verging on 100.  All died before final edit and release of the program.  While there are a few London aristocrats, most speak with the broad accents of the north country.  Before the war, they led modest lives: insurance clerk, shoe repairman, farm laborer or simply unemployed.  For many, military service was an escape from a dead-end existence.Their voices are the substance of the program; they are heard not just for the last time but the first time, as well.  These men and women had held their awful memories and crushing losses in stoic silence, for a lifetime.  It never occurred to them that they might have a chance to say something or that anyone would be interested; without exception, they speak clearly and honestly.  There's no point in giving a chapter-by-chapter guide; get the program.  I should note that it can also be listened to, from start to finish, without a single visual image.  This can be used as a follow-up, for a second or even third take.  Throughout 2 discs and 6 chapters (3 hours), there is an over-arching theme: the journey - both national and personal - from self-confidence to mute terror to disillusionment and finally hopelessness and desperation.A few samples -'People said Haig was wrong in making us go and fight the enemy.  Dammit, we couldn't sit there forever.  We had to get on with the job.''Up to then, the whole thing had been most enjoyable but now my heart stood still.  I suddenly realized this was warfare and I might not return.''We stood on the deck and sang:Homeland, homeland, when shall I see you again?Land of my birth, fairest place on earth, I'm leaving you.Oh it may be for years, it may be forever.Homeland, homeland.''The men that won the war was only the Tommy who was always cheerful, who always got a story to tell, the chap who carries on.''I didn't want to go...  I lived a sheltered life, I suppose.  And army life didn't appeal to me at all.  I had no inclination to fight anybody.  I mean, why should I go out and kill somebody I never knew?  For what reason?  There's no reason for it at all, in my way of thinking.''I picked them off, one by one.  I don't know how many I killed but it must have been in 3 figures because I was a very good shot.  I had very good eyesight, very good indeed.""""Being taken prisoner was the worst thing that I could ever imagine happening to me.  It made me feel as if I was a coward.  I was letting my country down, I was letting my battalion down, I was letting my family down - and it was a horrible, horrible feeling.''All hell let loose.  I'd never been under shellfire before and I was very nearly sick with fright, sick with fright.  For the first time I realized that I may die and I'd never experienced anything like it before - and I was terrified, I was shaking.''Oh, no - we didn't think it was in vain -  but I wouldn't volunteer to do it again.  We thought it was going to be a lovely little game, you know?  But it wasn't - it was wicked, wicked.''Why have we lost millions of men -  and the Germans, too - and all the other people that was in the war?  Why have we done that and then they settled it around a damned table?  Why couldn't they do that at first -  and save all those lives?''Like me, you get stuck by yourself, you know?  Things go through your mind, really.  Well, why did I join?  I still think -  it was for no bloody purpose.''I was happy.  I knew I did something for my country.'Unfortunately, Amazon no longer allows links to other sources.
