He gained sadistic pleasure from stalking, terrorizing, and torturing them.The 2 who survived the attack, Derek and Sam, hunt the wolf.  They fight to survive, and look for revenge.

1061951,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000O179DG,B. E Jackson,"[5, 7]","I must admit, Big Bad Wolf was a pleasant surprise.  What I initially believed was going to be a by the books horror flick, actually turned out to be a remarkably well told storyline-driven delight.  It's about (of course) a man who turns into a werewolf whenever there's a full moon.  This werewolf is muscle toned, fearless, pure evil and kills teenagers in graphic fashion.  However the storyline is definitely something that shouldn't be overlooked.The reason I keep bringing up the storyline is simple- it quickly takes a very differnet turn that I didn't see coming.  Let's be honest, in the beginning when a group of teenagers take off into the deep part of the forest and spend the night in a cabin, it seemed very obvious that the storyline would be based around one familiar overused formula- teens get drunk, teens party, teens have some frisky and exciting fun, werewolf sneaks around and kills the teens one by one, one teen manages to free him or herself and heroically saves the day.  However... no!  That's not what happens at all!Instead the movie writers went the *smart* route and allowed the cabin incident to be a very small portion of the overall story in order to avoid any predictable writing.  That's definitely commendable in my book.  As soon as a select few teens break free from the cabin, this is actually when the film begins for me.  Now it's about ""Who IS the werewolf, and how do we stop him?"" while introducing a few new characters.I must say, the biker chick was my favorite character because of her cool, rebellious personality.  I did like the shy, somewhat introverted blonde-haired teen as well (the main character).  The two of them being friends was actually the ultimate team because they were drastically different from each other.  It made for contrasting surprises that I really admired.Overall, Big Bad Wolf is awesome.  I highly recommend it to all horror fans.  The graphic violence is pretty extreme I admit (that normally focuses on body parts being ripped apart) but you can tell it's all really cheesy anyway so you can't actually get frightened by any of it by this point (well, unless you've been living under a rock and haven't been exposed to very many horror films in your lifetime).  This wolf is going to huff and puff and blow your expectations out of the water.",5,"big bad... no no, big good wolf",1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,2323,"['must', 'admit', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'What', 'initially', 'believed', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'books', 'horror', 'flick', 'actually', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'remarkably', 'well', 'told', 'storyline-driven', 'delight', 'course', 'man', 'who', 'werewolf', 'whenever', 'full', 'moon', 'werewolf', 'muscle', 'toned', 'fearless', 'pure', 'evil', 'teenagers', 'graphic', 'fashion', 'However', 'storyline', 'definitely', 'something', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'overlooked.The', 'reason', 'keep', 'bringing', 'up', 'storyline', 'simple-', 'quickly', 'very', 'differnet', 'turn', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'Let', 'be', 'honest', 'beginning', 'when', 'group', 'teenagers', 'take', 'off', 'deep', 'part', 'forest', 'spend', 'night', 'cabin', 'seemed', 'very', 'obvious', 'storyline', 'would', 'be', 'based', 'one', 'familiar', 'overused', 'formula-', 'teens', 'get', 'drunk', 'party', 'teens', 'have', 'frisky', 'exciting', 'fun', 'werewolf', 'sneaks', 'teens', 'one', 'one', 'one', 'teen', 'free', 'heroically', 'day', 'However', 'not', 'what', 'Instead', 'movie', 'writers', 'went', '*smart*', 'route', 'allowed', 'cabin', 'incident', 'be', 'very', 'small', 'portion', 'overall', 'story', 'order', 'avoid', 'predictable', 'writing', 'definitely', 'commendable', 'book', 'As', 'soon', 'select', 'few', 'teens', 'break', 'free', 'cabin', 'actually', 'when', 'film', 'Now', 'Who', 'werewolf', 'how', 'do', 'stop', 'introducing', 'few', 'new', 'characters.I', 'must', 'say', 'biker', 'chick', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'cool', 'rebellious', 'personality', 'did', 'shy', 'somewhat', 'introverted', 'blonde-haired', 'teen', 'as', 'well', 'main', 'character', 'two', 'being', 'friends', 'was', 'actually', 'ultimate', 'team', 'were', 'drastically', 'different', 'other', 'made', 'contrasting', 'surprises', 'really', 'admired.Overall', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'awesome', 'highly', 'recommend', 'horror', 'fans', 'graphic', 'violence', 'pretty', 'extreme', 'admit', 'normally', 'body', 'parts', 'being', 'ripped', 'apart', 'can', 'tell', 'really', 'cheesy', 'anyway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'actually', 'get', 'frightened', 'point', 'well', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'rock', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'exposed', 'very', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'lifetime', 'wolf', 'going', 'huff', 'puff', 'blow', 'expectations', 'water']",Big Bad Wolf
1061952,A26HD3S38PLD5A,B000O179DG,"BO BO BOB ""WESLEY""","[2, 3]","For this genre,this was one of the best. So many werewolf/monster movies have been made around the kids in the cabin, but this one was not. Had it been I would have loved for the makers to have explored the tension between Alex, the proverbial sex-crazed, in-crowd jock and Sam, the outsider, who does not care what anyone else thinks and has a defensive guard up so others cannot get close to her. That kind of mutual contempt usually leads to a good romantic storyline, even inthe middle of a horror movie. There are no other movies like this one, with the talking , very cognative  werewolf, who acts more than just on his animal instincts. All of the kids at the cabin were the usual; the witch of a beauty queen, the jock, the drunk, the nerd and the outcast. The storyline was not usual at all. The abusive stepfather/werewolf only made you want to see him get his that much more in the end. Derek was perfect as the nerd/hero. Throughout the movie you could see and feel his transformation from nerd to hero out of necessity.The sex scenes make this movie not for children, but for your average horror fan, this is a must see and must buy. Derek's uncle Charlie kind of died without too much of a heros' demise; punch, scratch, intestine,open head. There was always the hope that he and Derek's mom would end up together at the end, but if he had to be killed by the werewolf, he should have died putting up more of a fight, perhaps beating Derek's stepdad , fist to fist, before he turned into a werewolf and did the above. His death did add to the wanting for retribution, but some reconnection between Charlie and Dereks' mother should have happened.  I always like the nerd to hero movies. Usually, I would say that there was too much killing in such a movie, but everything was done so well, with the killing being wrapped around the other stories; abusive  husband and steupfather, nerd gets the girl, etc, etc.For years, ""The Howling"" was the greatest werewold movie I had ever seen. Then technolgy advanced, but the stories got worse. Along came ""Dog Soldiers"" which surpassed ""The Howling"". Big Bad Wolf equals and maybe supasses ""Dog Sodiers"". All in all, ""Big Bad Wolf"" is one big, bad movie.",4,"AS WEREWOLFS GO, I HOPE THIS ONE DOESN'T",1181520000,"06 11, 2007",2007,2210,"['genre', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'So', 'many', 'werewolf/monster', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'kids', 'cabin', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'Had', 'been', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'makers', 'have', 'explored', 'tension', 'Alex', 'proverbial', 'sex-crazed', 'in-crowd', 'jock', 'Sam', 'outsider', 'who', 'not', 'care', 'what', 'anyone', 'else', 'thinks', 'defensive', 'guard', 'up', 'so', 'others', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'close', 'kind', 'mutual', 'contempt', 'usually', 'good', 'romantic', 'storyline', 'even', 'inthe', 'middle', 'horror', 'movie', 'are', 'other', 'movies', 'one', 'talking', 'very', 'cognative', 'werewolf', 'who', 'more', 'just', 'animal', 'instincts', 'kids', 'cabin', 'were', 'usual', 'witch', 'beauty', 'queen', 'jock', 'drunk', 'nerd', 'outcast', 'storyline', 'was', 'not', 'usual', 'abusive', 'stepfather/werewolf', 'only', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'end', 'Derek', 'was', 'perfect', 'nerd/hero', 'movie', 'could', 'see', 'feel', 'transformation', 'nerd', 'hero', 'necessity.The', 'sex', 'scenes', 'make', 'movie', 'not', 'children', 'average', 'horror', 'fan', 'must', 'see', 'must', 'buy', 'Derek', 'uncle', 'Charlie', 'kind', 'died', 'too', 'much', 'heros', 'demise', 'punch', 'scratch', 'intestine', 'open', 'head', 'was', 'always', 'hope', 'Derek', 'mom', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'end', 'had', 'be', 'killed', 'werewolf', 'should', 'have', 'died', 'putting', 'up', 'more', 'fight', 'perhaps', 'beating', 'Derek', 'stepdad', 'fist', 'fist', 'turned', 'werewolf', 'did', 'above', 'death', 'did', 'add', 'wanting', 'retribution', 'reconnection', 'Charlie', 'Dereks', 'mother', 'should', 'have', 'happened', 'always', 'nerd', 'hero', 'movies', 'Usually', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'killing', 'such', 'movie', 'everything', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'killing', 'being', 'wrapped', 'other', 'stories', 'abusive', 'husband', 'steupfather', 'nerd', 'girl', 'etc', 'etc.For', 'years', 'Howling', 'was', 'greatest', 'werewold', 'movie', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'Then', 'technolgy', 'advanced', 'stories', 'got', 'worse', 'came', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'surpassed', 'Howling', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'equals', 'maybe', 'Dog', 'Sodiers', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'one', 'big', 'bad', 'movie']",Big Bad Wolf

Once I saw a group of six kids going to a cabin in the woods, I just expected this to be a run of the mill, werewolf picks off one kid at a time, type of movie. Well, I was very wrong. Four of the six get picked off in about five minutes, one even being brutally raped by the werewolf, and don't think I've seen that before in a movie. And that was just the first unique perspective thrown into the very tired werewolf genre. Don't get me wrong, this is no Ginger Snaps, a werewolf movie that just oozes originality, but this movie does not follow the boring standard of many films that came before it. It switches gears so often I'm not really sure what's about to come next. Awesome graphic kills, a high body count, and some pretty solid acting as well.

I have watched just about any movie with a werewolf in the story or on the cover. Unfortunatley, most werewolf movies suck. Some notable exceptions are: ""Ginger Snaps"", ""the Howling"" ""Wolfen"" and of course ""American Werewolf in London"". I was hestitant to pick up Big Bad Wolf because I have been let down often in the past (""Bad Moon"" and ""Cursed"" come to mind) but Big Bad Wolf delivered. I never expected the werewolf character to talk and deliver diabolical one-liners. And also didn't expect the werewolf to be a horny SOB that rapes his female victims. Fortunately both angles work well and make this werewolf story both unique and memorable.Richard Tyson always plays an effective bad guy and does it again in this movie even though he is covered in a werewolf suit for some of the movie.

1061964,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000O179DG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[12, 15]","Two hunters are out in the woods near their cabin when one of them is killed by a werewolf and the other one survives.  Eight years later meek Derek Cowley (Trevor Duke) talks his pierced gal pal ""Sam"" Marche (Kimberly J. Brown), on a trip with some other college kids up to the cabin owned by Derek's family, even though it is strictly verbotten by his step-father Mitchell Toblat (Richard Tyson).  It turns out Derek is the son of the man killed by the werewolf.  At this point you should think that you know exactly where ""Big Bad Wolf"" is going.  But there are a couple of surprises with this 2006 horror film.  The first is that everything you think is going to happen is pretty much going to happen, but in the first act.  The second is that when the werewolf shows up again, not only does it start killing the characters whose names we cannot remember, it makes a bunch of really lame jokes, including the old bit about huffing and puffing.  This is one strange werewolf movie.Once the second act begins, Sam gets to the crux of the matter, which is to figure out who the werewolf happens to be.  Actually, that does not take that long, but having seen a werewolf rip apart their acquaintances, Derek and Sam are insisting on being able to prove their suspicion. So this movie ends up going the ""Hamlet"" route, where Derek and Sam ""know"" who the werewolf is, but they fall into the trap of wanting proof so that they really ""know"" what they already ""know.""  Of course, this procrastination will end up killing people along the way, but that is what happens when the main part of the movie does not start until a half hour into the film.  But then we know full well that Act III is going to be played out back at the cabin in the woods, so nothing that happens while the sun is up really matters here.Unnecessary comic relief is provided by a television news crew that keeps trying to ambush Derek and Sam to find out what really happened out in the woods.  Reporter Nick Baxter (Adam Hendershott) wants to know what the kids are hiding and why they survived when the others died.  The police report must indicate that they jumped in a car and drove away, with the ""animal"" smashing a window and destroying a door.  But for the sake of argument let us pretend this is a legitimate journalistic question: why does this jerk reporter think might be a better explanation?  Does he think they are hiding the fact that the killer animal was a werewolf?  Are they assuming the kids survived because they are virgins?  Yes, I know, the whole idea here is to make the kids nervous and it has nothing to do with legitimate journalism, but this is what happens when a movie fails to engage your brain.  Besides, the reporter needs to bring the desert menu for the werewolf's last meal.To be fair, ""Big Bad Wolf"" does try to avoid being totally predictable.  A talking werewolf is rather different, although the makeup makes the creature look more like an ugly ape than a werewolf.  The werewolf in human form also has a few creepy moments as well during the second act.  As for the gore it is your basic clawing and dismemberment with a decided emphasis on excess.  The most shocking scene comes early on in a sick little in-joke regarding the only female virgin among the doomed students.  At the end I was starting to think of bumping up the rating on this one a bit, mainly because I like the character of Sam, but then she finds her weapon of choice and a silly little speech about deciding to live or to die gets punctuated by an unsurprising violent punch line and I gave up such thoughts (a judgment confirmed by the rather obvious ending that is not an ending).  The more you like over the top monster movies, the more you will like ""Big Bad Wolf,"" because this film ends up being all about the one-liners.",3,What if the werewolf started cracking bad one-liners like Freddy Kreuger?,1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,3810,"['Two', 'hunters', 'are', 'out', 'woods', 'cabin', 'when', 'one', 'killed', 'werewolf', 'other', 'one', 'Eight', 'years', 'later', 'meek', 'Derek', 'Cowley', 'Trevor', 'Duke', 'pierced', 'gal', 'pal', 'Sam', 'Marche', 'Kimberly', 'J', 'Brown', 'trip', 'other', 'college', 'kids', 'up', 'cabin', 'owned', 'Derek', 'family', 'even', 'strictly', 'verbotten', 'step-father', 'Mitchell', 'Toblat', 'Richard', 'Tyson', 'out', 'Derek', 'son', 'man', 'killed', 'werewolf', 'point', 'should', 'think', 'know', 'exactly', 'where', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'going', 'are', 'couple', 'surprises', '2006', 'horror', 'film', 'first', 'everything', 'think', 'going', 'happen', 'pretty', 'much', 'going', 'happen', 'first', 'act', 'second', 'when', 'werewolf', 'up', 'again', 'not', 'only', 'start', 'killing', 'characters', 'names', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'bunch', 'really', 'lame', 'jokes', 'including', 'old', 'bit', 'huffing', 'puffing', 'one', 'strange', 'werewolf', 'movie.Once', 'second', 'act', 'Sam', 'crux', 'matter', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'werewolf', 'be', 'Actually', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'having', 'seen', 'werewolf', 'rip', 'apart', 'acquaintances', 'Derek', 'Sam', 'are', 'insisting', 'being', 'able', 'prove', 'suspicion', 'movie', 'up', 'going', 'Hamlet', 'route', 'where', 'Derek', 'Sam', 'know', 'who', 'werewolf', 'fall', 'trap', 'wanting', 'proof', 'so', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'already', 'know', 'course', 'procrastination', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'killing', 'people', 'way', 'what', 'when', 'main', 'part', 'movie', 'not', 'start', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'then', 'know', 'full', 'well', 'Act', 'III', 'going', 'be', 'played', 'out', 'back', 'cabin', 'woods', 'so', 'nothing', 'sun', 'up', 'really', 'matters', 'here.Unnecessary', 'comic', 'relief', 'provided', 'television', 'news', 'crew', 'trying', 'ambush', 'Derek', 'Sam', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'out', 'woods', 'Reporter', 'Nick', 'Baxter', 'Adam', 'Hendershott', 'know', 'what', 'kids', 'are', 'hiding', 'why', 'survived', 'when', 'others', 'died', 'police', 'report', 'must', 'indicate', 'jumped', 'car', 'drove', 'away', 'animal', 'smashing', 'window', 'destroying', 'door', 'sake', 'argument', 'let', 'pretend', 'legitimate', 'journalistic', 'question', 'why', 'jerk', 'reporter', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'explanation', 'think', 'are', 'hiding', 'fact', 'killer', 'animal', 'was', 'werewolf', 'Are', 'assuming', 'kids', 'survived', 'are', 'virgins', 'Yes', 'know', 'whole', 'idea', 'here', 'make', 'kids', 'nervous', 'nothing', 'do', 'legitimate', 'journalism', 'what', 'when', 'movie', 'engage', 'brain', 'reporter', 'bring', 'desert', 'menu', 'werewolf', 'last', 'meal.To', 'be', 'fair', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'try', 'avoid', 'being', 'totally', 'predictable', 'talking', 'werewolf', 'rather', 'different', 'makeup', 'creature', 'look', 'more', 'ugly', 'ape', 'werewolf', 'werewolf', 'human', 'form', 'also', 'few', 'creepy', 'moments', 'well', 'second', 'act', 'gore', 'basic', 'clawing', 'dismemberment', 'decided', 'emphasis', 'excess', 'most', 'shocking', 'scene', 'early', 'sick', 'little', 'in-joke', 'regarding', 'only', 'female', 'virgin', 'doomed', 'students', 'end', 'was', 'starting', 'think', 'bumping', 'up', 'rating', 'one', 'bit', 'mainly', 'like', 'character', 'Sam', 'then', 'weapon', 'choice', 'silly', 'little', 'speech', 'deciding', 'live', 'die', 'punctuated', 'unsurprising', 'violent', 'punch', 'line', 'gave', 'up', 'such', 'thoughts', 'judgment', 'confirmed', 'rather', 'obvious', 'ending', 'not', 'ending', 'more', 'top', 'monster', 'movies', 'more', 'will', 'like', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'one-liners']",Big Bad Wolf

Not because of the violence, which was as over the top as one might expect, but because of the implication that sexual violence against women is somehow humorous.  Unlike other horror movies with a high boob and body count, the writer of this movie (Lance W. Dreesen) never misses an opportunity to completely degrade and dehumanize the female characters.  A disturbing, repeated theme is how sexual violence perpetrated against women is mocked by a ""joke"" from the werewolf character.  For instance, one of the throwaway sorority girls in the opening sequence is revealed to be a virgin; this seemingly unnecessary plot thread is brought to fruition after she is raped by the werewolf before her throat is ripped out during the rape.  After this despicable act, the werewolf taunts her boyfriend about the rape, remarking, ""she ain't a virgin anymore!""  Another example: the lead female character, Sam, is revealed to be in love with the lead male character Derek.  This seemingly innocent plot thread is exploited when she is forced to perform oral sex on Derek's evil stepdad.  Of course, evil stepdad tells Derek all about it and remarks, ""you ain't tapped that yet?""Don't let my description of these acts of sexual violence make you think that the acts are graphically depicted.  For the most part, the sex is implied rather than revealed, but the characters discuss sex in a graphic way.  I suppose it's all meant to reveal the main point of the movie, namely answering the question: ""what would happen if an evil s.o.b. was a werewolf?"" This movie certainly answers that question again and again, probably well beyond most viewers' willingness to watch it all.In summation, there's so much ugliness in this movie that it's hard to find a bright spot.  The concept of a talking, taunting werewolf is interesting, but I would have liked to see it utilized in a manner different from that described above.  Kimberly J. Brown is really excellent as Sam and Trevor Duke does a good job as wimpy Derek.  Richard Tyson does his best Jack Nicholson impersonation as Mitchell Toblat (""Talbot"" spelled backwards), which really isn't much of a complement.  I really hope that ""Big, Bad Wolf"" is the first and last movie made with this cast of characters.  I dread seeing what writer Lance W. Dreesen could come up with to try to top the sexual violence and hatred present in this movie.",2,Over the top and not in a good way....,1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,2482,"['usually', 'rave', 'crappy', 'movies', 'reviews', 'one', 'disturbed', 'more', 'most', 'others', 'Not', 'violence', 'was', 'top', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'implication', 'sexual', 'violence', 'women', 'somehow', 'humorous', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'high', 'boob', 'body', 'count', 'writer', 'movie', 'Lance', 'W.', 'Dreesen', 'never', 'opportunity', 'completely', 'degrade', 'dehumanize', 'female', 'characters', 'disturbing', 'repeated', 'theme', 'how', 'sexual', 'violence', 'perpetrated', 'women', 'mocked', 'joke', 'werewolf', 'character', 'instance', 'one', 'throwaway', 'sorority', 'girls', 'opening', 'sequence', 'revealed', 'be', 'virgin', 'seemingly', 'unnecessary', 'plot', 'thread', 'brought', 'fruition', 'raped', 'werewolf', 'throat', 'ripped', 'out', 'rape', 'despicable', 'act', 'werewolf', 'boyfriend', 'rape', 'remarking', 'ai', ""n't"", 'virgin', 'anymore', 'example', 'lead', 'female', 'character', 'Sam', 'revealed', 'be', 'love', 'lead', 'male', 'character', 'Derek', 'seemingly', 'innocent', 'plot', 'thread', 'exploited', 'when', 'forced', 'perform', 'oral', 'sex', 'Derek', 'evil', 'stepdad', 'course', 'evil', 'stepdad', 'tells', 'Derek', 'remarks', 'ai', ""n't"", 'tapped', 'yet', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'description', 'acts', 'sexual', 'violence', 'make', 'think', 'acts', 'are', 'graphically', 'depicted', 'most', 'part', 'sex', 'implied', 'rather', 'revealed', 'characters', 'discuss', 'sex', 'graphic', 'way', 'suppose', 'meant', 'reveal', 'main', 'point', 'movie', 'namely', 'answering', 'question', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'evil', 's.o.b', 'was', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'certainly', 'question', 'again', 'again', 'probably', 'well', 'most', 'viewers', 'willingness', 'watch', 'all.In', 'summation', 'so', 'much', 'ugliness', 'movie', 'hard', 'find', 'bright', 'spot', 'concept', 'talking', 'taunting', 'werewolf', 'interesting', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'utilized', 'manner', 'different', 'described', 'Kimberly', 'J', 'Brown', 'really', 'excellent', 'Sam', 'Trevor', 'Duke', 'good', 'job', 'wimpy', 'Derek', 'Richard', 'Tyson', 'best', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'impersonation', 'Mitchell', 'Toblat', 'Talbot', 'spelled', 'backwards', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'complement', 'really', 'hope', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'first', 'last', 'movie', 'made', 'cast', 'characters', 'dread', 'seeing', 'what', 'writer', 'Lance', 'W.', 'Dreesen', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'try', 'top', 'sexual', 'violence', 'hatred', 'present', 'movie']",Big Bad Wolf

Now for us that's a selling point letting us know we may have a real B gem on our hands, and when you sprinkle in Clint Howard it becomes an absolute ""sign me up for one of those!"" no questions asked. See for us Clint happens to be one of the pioneers to the weird looking brother of a famous actor genre. The guy's right up there with Don Swayze! He absolutely blew our mind in the 1995 release ofIce Cream Manleaving us on a mission the explore the Clint Howard market. Unfortunately Big Bad Wolf used Clint's renowned name like a bunch of good for nothing tricksters since he was only in it for 5 mins. That was a bit of a let down being that we convinced ourselves he was going to be the wolfman. However the film turned out to be very hilarious and earned itself a solid 3 star rating despite a large lack of Clint.Big Bad Wolf kicks off with a real Mary named Derek whose set on earning his way into a Frat. He has to do so by impressing Ashton Kutcher's brother Duechton Kutcher, some other pud, and two stereotypical loose horror movie chicks by bringing them to his step dad's cabin far in the woods. On the way they stop to ask directions from a Mr. Clint Howard who sternly warns them not to go into those woods. Since they don't take the wisdom of the almighty Clint they get themselves into trouble when they run into a very horny/violent werewolf. Once the werewolf tears up 4 out of 6 people Derek (Troy Mcgregor's brother) decides to identify the wolfman, which was quite obvious before the film even gets to that point. The rest of the film lack with some decent moments of laughter to then pick up again with the final battle scene.We have to give Big Bad Wolf for taking an interesting spin on the werewolf B genre. For the first time we got to see a wolfman that speaks English and is a total pervert, which was extremely entertaining. One of our favorite parts was when the wolf chased down Derek in his car and charged through the passenger side window head first shattering the glass everywhere. There's nothing more comical then someone headbutting their way through glass. A huge plus for the film came from the wolfman himself who looked very familiar while in human form. After a little research we were blown away to realize he was the main bad guy that Arnold hunted down in Kindergarten Cop. Between that and 5 minutes of Clint you're sure to get a decent rating. So Big Bad Wolf wasn't the best B horror you could pick but is still worth the watch.",3,Would have been an easy 5 stars if Clint Howard was the Wolfman,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,2573,"['reading', 'most', 'reviews', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'was', 'clear', 'had', 'real', 'crapfest', 'hands', 'Now', 'selling', 'point', 'letting', 'know', 'may', 'have', 'real', 'B', 'gem', 'hands', 'when', 'sprinkle', 'Clint', 'Howard', 'absolute', 'sign', 'one', 'questions', 'asked', 'See', 'Clint', 'be', 'one', 'pioneers', 'weird', 'looking', 'brother', 'famous', 'actor', 'genre', 'guy', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Don', 'Swayze', 'absolutely', 'blew', 'mind', '1995', 'release', 'ofIce', 'Cream', 'Manleaving', 'mission', 'explore', 'Clint', 'Howard', 'market', 'Unfortunately', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'used', 'Clint', 'renowned', 'name', 'bunch', 'good', 'nothing', 'tricksters', 'was', 'only', '5', 'mins', 'was', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'being', 'convinced', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'wolfman', 'However', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'hilarious', 'earned', 'solid', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'large', 'lack', 'Clint.Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'off', 'real', 'Mary', 'named', 'Derek', 'set', 'earning', 'way', 'Frat', 'do', 'so', 'impressing', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'brother', 'Duechton', 'Kutcher', 'other', 'pud', 'two', 'stereotypical', 'loose', 'horror', 'movie', 'chicks', 'bringing', 'step', 'dad', 'cabin', 'far', 'woods', 'way', 'stop', 'ask', 'directions', 'Mr.', 'Clint', 'Howard', 'who', 'sternly', 'not', 'go', 'woods', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'wisdom', 'almighty', 'Clint', 'get', 'trouble', 'when', 'run', 'very', 'horny/violent', 'werewolf', 'werewolf', 'up', '4', '6', 'people', 'Derek', 'Troy', 'Mcgregor', 'brother', 'identify', 'wolfman', 'was', 'quite', 'obvious', 'film', 'even', 'point', 'rest', 'film', 'lack', 'decent', 'moments', 'laughter', 'then', 'pick', 'up', 'again', 'final', 'battle', 'scene.We', 'have', 'give', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'taking', 'interesting', 'spin', 'werewolf', 'B', 'genre', 'first', 'time', 'got', 'see', 'wolfman', 'English', 'total', 'pervert', 'was', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'was', 'when', 'wolf', 'chased', 'down', 'Derek', 'car', 'charged', 'passenger', 'side', 'window', 'head', 'first', 'shattering', 'glass', 'everywhere', 'nothing', 'more', 'comical', 'then', 'someone', 'headbutting', 'way', 'glass', 'huge', 'plus', 'film', 'came', 'wolfman', 'who', 'looked', 'very', 'familiar', 'human', 'form', 'little', 'research', 'were', 'blown', 'away', 'realize', 'was', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'Arnold', 'hunted', 'down', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'Between', '5', 'minutes', 'Clint', ""'re"", 'sure', 'get', 'decent', 'rating', 'So', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'B', 'horror', 'could', 'pick', 'still', 'worth', 'watch']",Big Bad Wolf

It started out rather familiar with a group of kids(a balanced ticket including two jerky frat guys, their bitchy girlfriends, a nerd and the tough biker chick who sees everyone for who they are and isn't afraid to tell them)  going to a secluded cabin for a bit of hanky panky, then getting slaughtered by a werewolf.  This all happens within the first 30 minutes, and I was left wondering, ""where's it gonna go from here?""  Well, after that typically cliched half hour, the movie becomes rather interesting.  Our two heroes(the nerd and biker chick) catch on to who the werewolf is and try to blow his cover.  This consists mainly of trying to obtain a DNA sample form him.  Naturally the werewolf doesn't like this too much and it becomes a game of cat and mouse as he tries to silence those trying to blow the whistle on him.  The werewolf happens to be the stepfather of our nerdy hero(this isn't a spoiler, you learn this very early on), making it more difficult for our hero to get away from him.  Add to that, he has to try to convince his mother to leave this guy as well.  This werewolf is a bit different in the fact that he A) can speak, which results in a few very bad puns and wisecracks, and B) can change at will, though he's at his most uncontrollable during the full moon.  Stress seems to be the primary cause of changing as well.  What really works about this film is actor Richard Tyson who plays the wolf.  You may remember him as the bad guy Cullen Crisp in Kindergarten Cop, or better yet, as bully Buddy Revell in Three O'Clock High.  Tyson's great and comes across almost just as threatening in human form as he does as the wolf.

Seven years later, mom (Sarah Aldrich) has remarried to Mitchell (Richard Tyson). Derek is pledging a fraternity, one that has him take his biker chick friend Samantha (Kimberly J. Brown) to the proverbial cabin in the woods with two movie typical college couples.We already know it is a werewolf coming at us, no need to guess or a spinner. What we do find out is that this werewolf speaks, spouting out those &#34;Freddie-esque&#34; one liners. The film is linear with no twists. Derek (Trevor Duke-Moretz) was a very straight character and outside of some moments by Samantha, the characters were drab.

1061977,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000O179DG,Wuchak,"[3, 3]","*** This review contains mild plot spoilers ***""Big Bad Wolf"" (2006) indeed ranks with the best werewolf flicks. I wasn't so sure during the first half hour, which involves a group of college teens going out to a desolate cabin to party. The bulk of the group are unlikable frat trash and the film goes over-the-top with the gore, nudity and naughtiness as a werewolf attacks. There's also a semi-campy vibe that prevents the viewer from taking the material seriously; as such, it's thrilling, but not really scary.Like other viewers, I was surprised to see the cabin angle of the story end by the close of the first act. The typical horror flick would use this for the entire plot. I was like, ""Where are they going to go from here?"" Well, the two survivors start to suspect who the werewolf may be and join-up with someone else to end the werewolf's reign of terror.Despite the above negatives, everything comes together for an excellent werewolf flick. It all makes sense if you stick with it. For instance, why are Derek, the nerd, and Sam, the mechanic biyatch, the only two survivors of the original group? Sam comes off too-gruff at first, and it's a turn-off, but then it becomes clear that she was just able to see through the fakeness and superficiality of the frat trash and refused to take their sheet. Derek's the likable protagonist who's uncertain, but rises to the challenge when necessary. I found myself caring about these two and their potential relationship as the story progressed.After the first act, the movie becomes reminiscent of ""Fright Night"" in that it involves two teens -- a male and a female -- who suspect someone in the neighborhood of being a monster and hooking up with an older individual to take down the creature. Whereas ""Big Bad Wolf"" shares similarities to ""Fright Night"", 2008's ""Never Cry Werewolf"" wholesalely rips it off, just substituting a werewolf for a vampire (still, it's a really good werewolf flick).What impressed me with ""Fright Night"" was the hideousness and wickedness of the vampire; ""Big Bad Wolf"" does the same thing with the werewolf, but ups the ante. More than that, the werewolf retains the intelligence of the man to a large degree and can talk, which is an interesting addition to werewolf lore. It also makes the creature more interesting. Even more, they give dimension to the man who's infected by the werewolf curse. Later in the story it becomes clear that he WAS trying to keep himself from harming people when the full moon came. Yet this is contrasted by his basking in the curse whenever he becomes the werewolf. Good writing and attention to detail like this propels ""Big Bad Wolf"" to the head of the pack.There's a rockin' soundtrack and an an excellent number that plays during the end credits, ""Shelter"" by Green Vinyl Dream.I should stress that this is a hard R-rated film with some very crude moments, mainly because the werewolf is thoroughly evil and some of the youths are frat trash, but if you can look beneath its gruff exterior it's got a good heart and is a worthwhile experience.The film was shot in Semi Valley and Los Angeles, California, and runs 95 minutes.GRADE: A",5,Ranks with the best werewolf movies,1384646400,"11 17, 2013",2013,3160,"['***', 'review', 'mild', 'plot', 'spoilers', '***', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', '2006', 'indeed', 'best', 'werewolf', 'flicks', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'sure', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'group', 'college', 'teens', 'going', 'desolate', 'cabin', 'party', 'bulk', 'group', 'are', 'unlikable', 'frat', 'trash', 'film', 'over-the-top', 'gore', 'nudity', 'naughtiness', 'werewolf', 'attacks', 'also', 'semi-campy', 'vibe', 'viewer', 'taking', 'material', 'seriously', 'such', 'thrilling', 'not', 'really', 'scary.Like', 'other', 'viewers', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'cabin', 'angle', 'story', 'end', 'close', 'first', 'act', 'typical', 'horror', 'flick', 'would', 'use', 'entire', 'plot', 'was', 'Where', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'here', 'Well', 'two', 'survivors', 'start', 'suspect', 'who', 'werewolf', 'may', 'be', 'join-up', 'someone', 'else', 'end', 'werewolf', 'reign', 'above', 'negatives', 'everything', 'together', 'excellent', 'werewolf', 'flick', 'sense', 'stick', 'instance', 'why', 'are', 'Derek', 'nerd', 'Sam', 'mechanic', 'biyatch', 'only', 'two', 'survivors', 'original', 'group', 'Sam', 'too-gruff', 'first', 'turn-off', 'then', 'clear', 'was', 'just', 'able', 'see', 'fakeness', 'superficiality', 'frat', 'trash', 'refused', 'take', 'sheet', 'Derek', 'likable', 'protagonist', 'who', 'uncertain', 'challenge', 'when', 'necessary', 'found', 'caring', 'two', 'potential', 'relationship', 'story', 'progressed.After', 'first', 'act', 'movie', 'reminiscent', 'Fright', 'Night', 'two', 'teens', 'male', 'female', 'who', 'suspect', 'someone', 'neighborhood', 'being', 'monster', 'hooking', 'up', 'older', 'individual', 'take', 'down', 'creature', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'shares', 'Fright', 'Night', '2008', 'Never', 'Cry', 'Werewolf', 'wholesalely', 'off', 'just', 'substituting', 'werewolf', 'vampire', 'still', 'really', 'good', 'werewolf', 'flick', 'impressed', 'Fright', 'Night', 'was', 'hideousness', 'wickedness', 'vampire', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'same', 'thing', 'werewolf', 'ante', 'More', 'werewolf', 'intelligence', 'man', 'large', 'degree', 'can', 'talk', 'interesting', 'addition', 'werewolf', 'lore', 'also', 'creature', 'more', 'interesting', 'Even', 'more', 'give', 'dimension', 'man', 'who', 'infected', 'werewolf', 'curse', 'Later', 'story', 'clear', 'WAS', 'trying', 'keep', 'harming', 'people', 'when', 'full', 'moon', 'came', 'contrasted', 'basking', 'curse', 'whenever', 'werewolf', 'Good', 'writing', 'attention', 'detail', 'propels', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'head', 'pack.There', 'rockin', 'soundtrack', 'excellent', 'number', 'end', 'Shelter', 'Green', 'Vinyl', 'Dream.I', 'should', 'stress', 'hard', 'R-rated', 'film', 'very', 'crude', 'moments', 'mainly', 'werewolf', 'thoroughly', 'evil', 'youths', 'are', 'frat', 'trash', 'can', 'look', 'beneath', 'gruff', 'got', 'good', 'heart', 'worthwhile', 'experience.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Semi', 'Valley', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'California', '95', 'minutes.GRADE']",Big Bad Wolf

I suspect that the high ratings here are the result of appreciation for the violent sexual content of the film, but be honest; it was a low-budget, meaningless, badly-acted pile best watched while drunk.  I gave this film one star based on the dvd cover - it's scary, perfectly composed, and beautifully uses lighting and color.  Remember, I'm talking about the cover there.The talking werewolf sounded like an idiot and only a high-schooler would find those puns amusing.  David Naughton (who still looks pretty good) and Clint Howard showed up for their paychecks, albeit briefly.  What does that stepfather do in order to afford a two-million dollar home?  And why does he have enough time to wander around?  What is with that 70's haircut?I suppose the most annoying thing is that the movie starts very briefly in ""Equatorial Cameroon"" and that caused a nagging feeling that wouldn't go away.  Would you let your lovely sister-in-law marry a murderous lunatic, knowing full well that the lunatic could rip apart her, your precious nephew, and dozens of other victims?  There you are, Charlie (yeah, you loser of a character), out being a tough guy hunting in Africa, and you just accept the killer and your brother's death with aplomb.  I suppose you couldn't do anything about it.  Oh, no, I suppose you couldn't find a use for that high-powered rifle just then.  You are only puttering about in the dark in a dangerous country where no one ever asks questions and you could have easily stopped it all with no problem.
