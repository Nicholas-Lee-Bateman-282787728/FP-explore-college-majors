Granted that it is a slow movie as others have reviewed, but I find the slowness add to the storyline.  I wonder what is going on in the minds of the people in the movie as each scene opens up.  This is not a movie that would leave you happy and content at the end.  It does ask you difficult questions about the fairness of life in general.  If you have any friends or family who are suffering through depression, when they feel that there is no hope left, this movie will convey those feelings.This movie is not for anyone wanting a fast action movie, but if you are a philosopher or someone researching on the theme of death, despair, kindness; you will find all of those theme here.",5,Descend into despair,1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,760,"['how', 'felt', 'main', 'character', 'going', 'when', 'watched', 'movie', 'Granted', 'slow', 'movie', 'others', 'have', 'reviewed', 'find', 'slowness', 'add', 'storyline', 'wonder', 'what', 'going', 'minds', 'people', 'movie', 'scene', 'up', 'not', 'movie', 'would', 'leave', 'happy', 'content', 'end', 'ask', 'difficult', 'questions', 'fairness', 'life', 'general', 'have', 'friends', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'suffering', 'depression', 'when', 'feel', 'hope', 'left', 'movie', 'will', 'convey', 'feelings.This', 'movie', 'not', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'fast', 'action', 'movie', 'are', 'philosopher', 'someone', 'researching', 'theme', 'death', 'despair', 'kindness', 'will', 'find', 'theme', 'here']",In The Fog

1654933,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00DCJ2ARC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[11, 15]","The aptly titled ""In The Fog"" from filmmaker Sergei Loznitsa is an arthouse mood piece that won't necessarily appeal to viewers expecting some sort of WWII epic.  It has a scrambled narrative timeline, fairly stoic protagonists, long stretches absent of dialogue, and lingering and stationary camera work.  It creates a dreamlike state where every character is facing a world NOT of their own devising and just doing the best they can to survive.  Are their choices right? Are they wrong? Are they somewhere in between, perhaps in the fog? Whatever the answer, there seems to be an extremely limited number of options!  Loznitsa is responsible for 2010's ""My Joy,"" and supporters of that picture can see some of the same filmic elements utilized here (albeit on a more intimate scale).  Some, however, were confused by that dark and challenging parable about contemporary Russia due to its storytelling devices.  ""In The Fog,"" while no less compelling, is structured in a less experimental way and is infinitely more linear and straightforward (even though it tells three alternating stories in flashback).  While not necessarily an entertaining movie, ""In The Fog"" has a silent power that creeps up on you and the experience has lingered with me.  It is a quiet and contemplative film that gets under your skin.The film takes place in German-occupied Russia circa 1942.  A rural community has been devastated by the war and the countryside has been divided into those in the resistance and those that are sympathizers.  Although that distinction seems rather black or white, most of the citizens are not political and/or have not made particularly conscious choices.  As a bigger battle rages around them, they are looking to get by and have been boxed into cooperating or fighting with little middle ground.  We see this distinction with the film's three protagonists.  The movie begins with two resistance fighters (Vlad Abashin as Burov and Sergei Kolesov as Voitik) crossing the forest to apprehend a suspected sympathizer (Vladimir Svirski as Sushenya).  Sushenya was a German prisoner who was released from captivity even as those he was arrested with were put to death.  Even though Burov was a former friend, the fate does not look good for the upright Sushenya who proclaims he did not strike a deal with German officials.  On the journey back to the resistance camp, the three face an ambush.  In its aftermath, we follow flashbacks that delineate how each of the men arrived at this point.And that is the strength of ""In The Fog.""  In these stories, we see each start down a path that they never intended.  Small actions and confrontations had long-range repercussions.  Sushenya is noble and dignified and it is his honor and loyalty that are questioned by his friends and family.  Burov is hot-headed, and his pride led him into present circumstances.  But still, he tries to do right.  And Voitik is more opportunistic, his choices are not moral or political but based on survival instinct.  As these men are thrown together, we see how this dynamic plays out between them.  But in general, the war is a much bigger obstacle and they are all consumed by their roles in it.  Again, this isn't about action or fighting (although there is a bit of both).  Rather it is about a quiet contemplation that comes with accepting the limitations that life puts on you.  Circumstances don't have to define you, but they invariably affect you to the very core.  As I said, I didn't love ""In The Fog"" as an entertaining experience, but I've thought about it a lot.  In my mind, that makes it a success.
