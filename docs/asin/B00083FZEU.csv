898196,A34A7QEBMYTALW,B00083FZEU,"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged""","[4, 4]","Helmed by master director Anthony Hickox of 'Full Eclipse'(sucked) and 'Federal Protection'(really sucked)fame comes the newest Steven Seagal action flick, strangely titled 'Submerged'.Lord Steven stars as Kody, a totally sexy ex-military stud in prison, who is asked by the US government to stop some terrorists who have created some kind of mind-warp device to get people to do things they want them to do(i.e. kill people).  The Lord agrees to his mission, on one condition:  he gets all of his old crew released from prison to help him.  Being a bunch of the world's best criminals, soldiers, mercenaries, etc. I wonder why they are all in prison?  Anyways, take one part 'Dirty Dozen' and a dash of 'Armageddon', add in a crapload of lameness and you get the basic gist of 'Submerged'.I had high hopes for 'Submerged'.  It had a pretty good supporting cast:  Gary Daniels(martial arts and low-budget action film legend), Peter Youngblood Hills(from 'Band Of Brothers'), and everybody's favorite Englishman Vinnie Jones.The plot, while ridiculous, was viable enough to give the fans what they want:  some killer action.  But no dice.  I figured that with Seagal and Daniels finally in a movie together, that there would be a killer fight scene.  But no.  Seagal kills him in like ten seconds about twenty minutes into the film.  That scene is actually about the only hand-to-hand fight in the film.  Mostly everything else is hot gun action, which would be fine if there were some originality to the scenes but there just isn't.  Vinnie Jones is excellent, as always, but gets killed off so fast I had to rewind to make sure it was him and not some random bad guy.Then there are the special effects:  completely lame.  I just love the little toy plane in the film's opening shot.  That set the tone for the entire flick.  I saw it and was like ""Oh great...another Seagal masterpiece."" and I was right.  Speaking of the Lord, if you thought the dubbing in 'Out Of Reach' was bad just you wait till you watch 'Submerged'.  Its ridiculous.Easily the best part of the film is when Seagal is released from prison.  He comes lumbering down the hall in chains wearing prison garb.  Only, its not your normal prison clothing.  It looks exactly like the clothes he normally wears only made out of prison blue denim.  Freaking hilarious.  Also, another highpoint, is the Lord calling people ""Alligator"" in the worst Cajun accent ever.Overall, 'Submerged' is just all-out bad.  Seagal is his usual puffy, nappy, tubby self.  The action and special effects are lame.  The spirited performances of Jones and Hills give the movie a bit more credibility than it deserves.  And why is it called 'Submerged'?  They're on a submarine for about three minutes total.  But 'Submerged' is still better than all of his recent releases save for the fabulous 'Belly Of The Beast'.I love Seagal and will, like a stupid lemming, keep buying his films, but this is starting to get ridiculous now.",2,Submerged In Feces,1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,2972,"['Helmed', 'master', 'director', 'Anthony', 'Hickox', ""'Full"", 'Eclipse', 'sucked', ""'Federal"", 'Protection', 'really', 'sucked', 'fame', 'newest', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'action', 'flick', 'strangely', 'titled', ""'Submerged'.Lord"", 'Steven', 'stars', 'Kody', 'totally', 'sexy', 'ex-military', 'stud', 'prison', 'who', 'asked', 'US', 'government', 'stop', 'terrorists', 'who', 'have', 'created', 'kind', 'mind-warp', 'device', 'get', 'people', 'do', 'things', 'want', 'do', 'i.e', 'kill', 'people', 'Lord', 'mission', 'one', 'condition', 'old', 'crew', 'released', 'prison', 'help', 'Being', 'bunch', 'world', 'best', 'criminals', 'soldiers', 'mercenaries', 'etc', 'wonder', 'why', 'are', 'prison', 'Anyways', 'take', 'one', 'part', 'Dozen', 'dash', ""'Armageddon"", 'add', 'crapload', 'lameness', 'get', 'basic', 'gist', ""'Submerged'.I"", 'had', 'high', 'hopes', ""'Submerged"", 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Gary', 'Daniels', 'martial', 'arts', 'low-budget', 'action', 'film', 'legend', 'Peter', 'Youngblood', 'Hills', ""'Band"", 'Brothers', 'everybody', 'favorite', 'Englishman', 'Vinnie', 'Jones.The', 'plot', 'ridiculous', 'was', 'viable', 'enough', 'give', 'fans', 'what', 'want', 'killer', 'action', 'dice', 'figured', 'Seagal', 'Daniels', 'finally', 'movie', 'together', 'would', 'be', 'killer', 'fight', 'scene', 'Seagal', 'ten', 'seconds', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'scene', 'actually', 'only', 'hand-to-hand', 'fight', 'film', 'Mostly', 'everything', 'else', 'hot', 'gun', 'action', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'were', 'originality', 'scenes', 'just', ""n't"", 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'excellent', 'always', 'killed', 'off', 'fast', 'had', 'rewind', 'make', 'sure', 'was', 'not', 'random', 'bad', 'guy.Then', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'completely', 'lame', 'just', 'love', 'little', 'toy', 'plane', 'film', 'opening', 'shot', 'set', 'tone', 'entire', 'flick', 'saw', 'was', 'Oh', 'great', 'Seagal', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'right', 'Speaking', 'Lord', 'thought', 'dubbing', ""'Out"", 'Reach', 'was', 'bad', 'just', 'wait', 'till', 'watch', ""'Submerged"", 'ridiculous.Easily', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'when', 'Seagal', 'released', 'prison', 'lumbering', 'down', 'hall', 'chains', 'wearing', 'prison', 'garb', 'Only', 'not', 'normal', 'prison', 'clothing', 'exactly', 'clothes', 'normally', 'only', 'made', 'prison', 'blue', 'denim', 'Freaking', 'hilarious', 'Also', 'highpoint', 'Lord', 'calling', 'people', 'Alligator', 'worst', 'Cajun', 'accent', 'ever.Overall', ""'Submerged"", 'just', 'all-out', 'bad', 'Seagal', 'usual', 'puffy', 'nappy', 'tubby', 'self', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'lame', 'spirited', 'performances', 'Jones', 'Hills', 'give', 'movie', 'bit', 'more', 'credibility', 'why', 'called', ""'Submerged"", ""'re"", 'submarine', 'three', 'minutes', 'total', ""'Submerged"", 'still', 'better', 'recent', 'releases', 'save', 'fabulous', ""'Belly"", ""Beast'.I"", 'love', 'Seagal', 'will', 'stupid', 'lemming', 'keep', 'buying', 'films', 'starting', 'get', 'ridiculous', 'now']",N/A

He of course uses this for evil purposes and Steven Seagal and company are sent to kill him. As in many of his more recent movies Steven is frequently dubbed as he seems unable to speak loudly enough to be heard these days. The action is good, lots of gun fights, a little bit of martial arts. The plot is OK and the supporting cast does a fine job. I would like to see Steven get a bit of enthusiasm about his work though, he seems to coast through some of his latest efforts.In probably my favorite scene Steven seems to have aquired a bulletproof force field. A tank and 20 or so soldiers are approaching Steven and his crew, none of whom are behind any sort of cover. The good guys kill every bad guy with only one of their own ever being hit. Even the tank misses when it shoots. Steven dispatches the last three or four troops with some nifty hand-to-hand moves (the bad guys seem to forget they have guns) and then one of his crew tosses him a primed grenade which his calmly drops into an open hatch in the tank, finishing it off as well.",3,Speak more clearly,1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,1136,"['mad', 'doctor', 'can', 'train', 'people', 'minds', 'so', 'instructions', 'what', 'do', 'course', 'evil', 'purposes', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'company', 'are', 'sent', 'kill', 'many', 'more', 'recent', 'movies', 'Steven', 'frequently', 'dubbed', 'unable', 'speak', 'loudly', 'enough', 'be', 'heard', 'days', 'action', 'good', 'lots', 'gun', 'fights', 'little', 'bit', 'martial', 'arts', 'plot', 'OK', 'supporting', 'cast', 'fine', 'job', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Steven', 'get', 'bit', 'enthusiasm', 'work', 'though', 'coast', 'latest', 'efforts.In', 'probably', 'favorite', 'scene', 'Steven', 'have', 'aquired', 'bulletproof', 'force', 'field', 'tank', '20', 'so', 'soldiers', 'are', 'approaching', 'Steven', 'crew', 'none', 'whom', 'are', 'sort', 'cover', 'good', 'guys', 'kill', 'bad', 'guy', 'only', 'one', 'own', 'ever', 'being', 'hit', 'Even', 'tank', 'when', 'shoots', 'Steven', 'last', 'three', 'four', 'troops', 'nifty', 'hand-to-hand', 'moves', 'bad', 'guys', 'seem', 'forget', 'have', 'guns', 'then', 'one', 'crew', 'primed', 'grenade', 'calmly', 'open', 'hatch', 'tank', 'finishing', 'off', 'as', 'well']",N/A

The level of special effects were horrible, with presentations that were so false it made me want to poke my finger through the screen to see if my outstretched hand would go right through the paper looking backdrops.  Weak characters and a plot that spins around forever without really going anywhere other than down.  Seriously, skip this and be selective when looking for a Seagal film anymore because this cheaply made straight to DVD stuff is terrible.  I wish Seagal himself would have some pride but considering he probably is not getting any offers, he has to take what he can get.  The last major role he had in a great action film was unfortunately when he fell out of that airplane at the beginning of the movieExecutive Decisionand it obviously has been a free fall ever since.

898203,A2ORZYOH2IRT9W,B00083FZEU,Jason Dodge,"[2, 5]","Ever since Steven Seagal did his first direct-to-video movie, ""The Patriot"" (1998), which was so horrible that HBO bought the rights to it for a measly $1.3 million, his career has spiraled downward. It almost seems that ""Exit Wounds"" (2001) was going to relaunch his career, especially when it pulled ina staggering $60+ million in its opening weekend. But then, he followed that film with ""Half Past Dead"" (2002), a $30 million project that barely achieved half of what it costs at the box office. Ever since that completely awful film, Seagal has been strictly doing direct-to-DVD projects. In fact, ""Submerged"" (2005) is actually the seventh movie that we've seen him star in since 2002, and you might be surprised to learn that he's attached to five more projects as I write this. for whatever reason, though his name doesn't demand that kind of box office receipts that he once received, direct-to-DVD movies seem to be giving him a steady flow of work. I think that there are people out there that still respect Seagal, and hope that he is involved with a smash hit once again. I myself, continue to rent his movies that continue to come out, despite how disappointed I usually am from his previous attempt.So does ""Submerged"" (2005) succeed? No. Although arguably not as horrible as some of his other projects, Seagal doesn't have much of a personality in the film. His acting abilities really haven't gotten better, and his Cajoun accent just doesn't work (it's even worse than his Russian accent in""The Foreigner""). Even worse, despite being the executive producer of the film, his voice is dubbed in a number of sequences by another actor entirely -- which makes it even more disjointed. The action sequences consist of everybody standing out in the open while shooting -- nobody really seems to duck for cover. Though it's nice to see that Seagal isn't using a body double for the martial art sequences this time around, which he did in ""Belly of the Beast"" (2003), but he is only involved in TWO hand-to-hand combat sequence is in the entire movie. One with Gary Daniels (who is an accomplished martial artist, and even fought Jackie Chan on-screen before), which is a fairly quick knife fight that doesn't even come close to energy or complexity that the two other films we've seen Seagal do this in, ""Under Siege"" (1992) and ""Under Siege 2"" (1995). The other sequence is over so quickly that you could easily miss it if you weren't looking. Once again, Seagal sticks with the philosophy that nobody else is good enough to even score a hit on his body. We've certainly seen ""mind control"" premises before (which is the overall plot), but the subject matter doesn't really go anywhere new. There's also an extraneous amount of ""quick cutting"" during certain moments that is so unrefined -- your eyes will have a hard time focusing. It's even more jumbled than your typical Michael Bay production, and goes beyond that traditional MTV-vibe that crops up every once and awhile.I've enjoyed Steven Seagal movies in the past, and I continued to watch every production of his that still comes out today, by it really seems that virtually none of the action stars that we've come to know from the 1980s and 90s have continued their success past 2000. Most notably, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris -- it's obvious that fans are still entertained by these actors today, but they don't demand a type of success that they once had. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger, possibly the biggest action star of the '90s, has had a number of lackluster movie projects, one after another. After a number of years, he eventually moved on to become the governor of California. Maybe Seagal should either become extremely serious about extending his acting abilities, or give up always having the starring role and become a well-established martial arts choreographer for Hollywood films. Just like Van Damme, Seagal's continuing efforts on a direct-to-DVD front just keep getting worse. ""Submerged"" is no exception, and it doesn't contain anything that we haven't seen before from other numerous action films. Please rent this movie first, if you absolutely must, because I know many of you out there are curious if Seagal has returned to his former glory. He hasn't... but you'll feel worse if you spend $20 to buy this DVD.",2,Steven Seagal in another lackluster production -- Surprised?,1117929600,"06 5, 2005",2005,4316,"['Ever', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'did', 'first', 'direct-to-video', 'movie', 'Patriot', '1998', 'was', 'so', 'horrible', 'HBO', 'bought', 'rights', 'measly', '1.3', 'million', 'career', 'spiraled', 'downward', 'almost', 'Exit', 'Wounds', '2001', 'was', 'going', 'relaunch', 'career', 'especially', 'when', 'pulled', 'ina', 'staggering', '60+', 'million', 'opening', 'weekend', 'then', 'followed', 'film', 'Half', 'Past', 'Dead', '2002', '30', 'million', 'project', 'barely', 'achieved', 'half', 'what', 'box', 'office', 'Ever', 'completely', 'awful', 'film', 'Seagal', 'been', 'strictly', 'doing', 'direct-to-DVD', 'projects', 'fact', 'Submerged', '2005', 'actually', 'seventh', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'star', '2002', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'learn', 'attached', 'five', 'more', 'projects', 'write', 'reason', 'name', ""n't"", 'demand', 'kind', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'once', 'received', 'direct-to-DVD', 'movies', 'seem', 'be', 'giving', 'steady', 'flow', 'work', 'think', 'are', 'people', 'there', 'still', 'respect', 'Seagal', 'hope', 'involved', 'smash', 'hit', 'once', 'again', 'continue', 'rent', 'movies', 'continue', 'come', 'out', 'how', 'disappointed', 'usually', 'am', 'previous', 'attempt.So', 'Submerged', '2005', 'succeed', 'arguably', 'not', 'as', 'horrible', 'other', 'projects', 'Seagal', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'personality', 'film', 'acting', 'abilities', 'really', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'better', 'Cajoun', 'accent', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'even', 'worse', 'Russian', 'accent', 'Foreigner', 'Even', 'worse', 'being', 'executive', 'producer', 'film', 'voice', 'dubbed', 'number', 'sequences', 'actor', 'entirely', 'even', 'more', 'disjointed', 'action', 'sequences', 'consist', 'everybody', 'standing', 'out', 'open', 'shooting', 'nobody', 'really', 'duck', 'cover', 'nice', 'see', 'Seagal', ""n't"", 'using', 'body', 'double', 'martial', 'art', 'time', 'did', 'Belly', 'Beast', '2003', 'only', 'involved', 'TWO', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'sequence', 'entire', 'movie', 'One', 'Gary', 'Daniels', 'who', 'accomplished', 'martial', 'artist', 'even', 'fought', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'on-screen', 'before', 'fairly', 'quick', 'knife', 'fight', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'energy', 'complexity', 'two', 'other', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Seagal', 'do', 'Siege', '1992', 'Siege', '2', '1995', 'other', 'sequence', 'so', 'quickly', 'could', 'easily', 'miss', 'were', ""n't"", 'looking', 'Once', 'again', 'Seagal', 'sticks', 'philosophy', 'nobody', 'else', 'good', 'enough', 'even', 'score', 'hit', 'body', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'seen', 'mind', 'control', 'premises', 'overall', 'plot', 'subject', 'matter', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'new', 'also', 'extraneous', 'amount', 'quick', 'cutting', 'certain', 'moments', 'so', 'unrefined', 'eyes', 'will', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'focusing', 'even', 'more', 'jumbled', 'typical', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'production', 'traditional', 'MTV-vibe', 'up', 'once', 'awhile.I', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'movies', 'past', 'continued', 'watch', 'production', 'still', 'out', 'today', 'really', 'virtually', 'none', 'action', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', '1980s', '90s', 'have', 'continued', 'success', '2000', 'Most', 'notably', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'obvious', 'fans', 'are', 'still', 'entertained', 'actors', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'demand', 'type', 'success', 'once', 'had', 'Even', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'possibly', 'biggest', 'action', 'star', ""'90s"", 'had', 'number', 'lackluster', 'movie', 'projects', 'one', 'number', 'years', 'eventually', 'moved', 'become', 'governor', 'California', 'Maybe', 'Seagal', 'should', 'either', 'become', 'extremely', 'serious', 'extending', 'acting', 'abilities', 'give', 'up', 'always', 'having', 'starring', 'role', 'become', 'well-established', 'martial', 'arts', 'choreographer', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'Just', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Seagal', 'continuing', 'efforts', 'direct-to-DVD', 'front', 'just', 'keep', 'getting', 'worse', 'Submerged', 'exception', ""n't"", 'contain', 'anything', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'numerous', 'action', 'films', 'Please', 'rent', 'movie', 'first', 'absolutely', 'must', 'know', 'many', 'are', 'curious', 'Seagal', 'returned', 'former', 'glory', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'feel', 'worse', 'spend', '20', 'buy', 'DVD']",N/A

The premise was originally to be about mutants being on a sub and Steven fighting them off. But they changed it to a more logical plot(very happy they did). Submerged stars Steven Seagal, and Vinnie Jones. They are the most important actors in this film. Basically Steven is a independent agent who has his own private crew and they take out the bad guys. He is called upon to deal with a scientest who created a mind controlling drug and has used it to take out the US Ambassador. Steven and the others know that something else is going to down and they must hurry and stop it!Submerged is better then Out for a Kill, Belly of the Beast, Out of Reach and Into the Sun(which we all thought would be good). Into the Sun had a budget of $35million. This one had only $15million. But the ACTION WAS GREAT! There were 5 times more action then Into The Sun. The plot was better and so were the characters. I was happy to see such good actors. The CGI werent tops. but they got the job done. There is a good amount of action to keep the fans pleased. I know I was. Submerged is rated ""R"" for Strong Violence and Language. Probably the best movie he has made since Exit Wounds. In my opinion only, if this movie has a bigger budget and more known actors, this could have been Under Seige 3! It was that good.

898211,A2HSFKLLQHYY6S,B00083FZEU,Matt Skidmore,"[1, 2]","Our favourite fading action star and direct to video purveyor of junk (yep, that's you Steven) returns with another mindless and poorly dubbed excuse for a film that barely grades as both a film and a piece of entertainment.The story has The Seagal playing Chris Cody (ex military, ex special opps, ex pizza restaurant owner - tick if any apply) recently released from a US military prison to lead a team of mercenaries who are on the quest to stop a renegade scientist Dr Lehder (played by british actor Nick Brimble, who at least makes an effort) who has developed a strange mind control technology that has been created to turn soldiers into unstoppable killing machines. Cody is promised by the government that if he brings the mad doctor back in and rescues a delta team who have been kidnapped, he and his team will be cleared of their crimes of misconduct and paid a cool 100,000 each. However, our good friend The Seagal is suspicious of this and takes the mission into his own hands and leads the team into enemy territory without the aid of the military. From here on in, its all submarine corridors, actionless action and terrible dubbing.The Seagal seems like he is in some other movie for the most part, spouting stupid dialogue which raises question to who or what he is supposed to be - the dubbing doesn't help matters as well. With his own voice replaced by a totally different actor in various scene length sections - and when he does make the effort to loop is own lines, he changes the delivery so many times, you just give up trying to follow him. Vinnie Jones fares so much better and his performance is strong and really keeps the picture moving - both funny and engaging, he pushes the movie and if justice was anything, would have been given top billing. His performance outstrips The Seagal at every turn.Production values are questionable to say the least. It all looks like outtakes from other movies (a staple element from producers Nu Image / Millennium) with stock sets and terrible effects work. The supporting cast do seem to try (although an opportunity is wasted when action star Gary Daniels fights The Seagal, which is rather abruptly over in seconds!), but when your star just seems to be coasting and offering random speeches that don't fit in with the story displayed on screen - it seems their efforts are for nought.Its a shame as director Anthony Hickox is a personal favourite and on past performances, shows creative flare on low budget horror and action vehicles - witness his excellent 'Waxwork' and 'Hellraiser' sequel - but, even he seems to be lost in this dull exercise. Having read his comments about working on the production, I get the idea this wasn't his finest hour, either.Again, another entry in the dull line of direct to video pap for the once action legend. Oh, how 'Exit Wounds' was such a long time ago now. I blame myself as I keep coming back for more, but what with this - the dull 'Pistol Whipped' and the abominable 'Attack Force' - The Seagal is going to find it hard to regain his fans. Sure, 'Renegade Justice' was a minor diamond in the rough - but, when an audience gets the feeling that the star isn't interested in what he is making himself - then, eventually your audience will just move away.Sony's disc is a movie only affair. A standard transfer - but, as the movie doesn't offer anything in terms of good production values, it doesn't really matter. Two stars for Vinnie Jones and Anthony Hickox.

898212,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00083FZEU,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[0, 0]","You've got to hand it to ""Submerged"" for being very different from any other movie starring Steven Seagal. Director Anthony Hickox (Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth) certainly had a vision that departed from typical action fare when he co-wrote and directed this little thriller. Whether you like it or not, any regular viewer of Seagal's fare will at least look twice at what at what the Seagal-Hickox duo bring to the table...the problem is, this one's guaranteed to have more people looking back in disappointment than admiration.The story: imprisoned mercenary Chris Kody (Seagal) is promised the release of himself and his team on the condition that they stop a major terrorist strike against America headed by a sadistic mad scientist (Nick Brimble,Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves). After managing to leave his Uruguayan terrorist base demolished, Kody and his team are set to return home by submarine, taking with them several POWs...unaware that their seemingly harmless quarry has been brainwashed to turn against them at the push of a button. Kody must not only escape assassination, but also stop this dangerous new type of warfare from spreading through the highest levels of government.I'm pretty sure that my summary doesn't cover everything in the film, but can you blame me? Up there withThe Foreigner, this is one of the convoluted, difficult-to-follow films Steven's ever been in. While the plot's a given dud, the film does have a few good points: even though Seagal and bad-guy Brimble leave a lot to be desired in the acting department, Christine Adams (Eye of the Dolphin), William Hope (Aliens), and Vinnie Jones (Snatch) give decent performances. In addition, if you can get over the mind-bogglingly fake-looking airplane in the film's opening shots, the production is generally better than Seagal's other DTV outings with good set design. The scenes in submarine are effectively creepy, letting Hickox show off his credentials in building up a decent-looking thriller.Alas, only about a quarter of the film takes place in the actual submarine, which is less than the amount of time that Seagal's voice is dubbed by another actor. Though the film manages to keep ahold of a certain amount of suspense throughout its duration, it's watered down by dumb dialogue (Seagal calls people ""white boy"" and ""alligator"" now and then), the fact that the supporting characters are extremely underdeveloped, glaring factual errors about the Republic of Uruguay and the Italian language (""It's all in Spanish!""), and a general feeling of the entire production not being entirely tied down. In addition, the shootout in the tunnel - in which a handful of mercenaries armed with submachine guns manage to hold off at least two dozen advancing soldiers and a tank without cover - should receive an award for the most unconvincing action scene ever. Luckily, the remaining action-y bitaren't as bad...they're just completely forgettable. This is especially shameful considering that the movie offers us the minor dream match-up of Steven Seagal fighting B-movie dragon Gary Daniels (Fist of the North Star) as one of the mindwashed baddies, but it's screwed up by being a short, completely one-sided game of beat-up-the-Brit. Would fulfilling expectations have hurt at all here?While I wouldn't go as far as to call this Seagal's worst movie, it should certainly prove to any nay-sayer that the man's career is slowly wheeling towards its deathbed. This is definitely a fans-only purchase, and that will be only so you can convince yourself of the horror stories you've heard about this film on the forums.

I'd also like to say could someone please give Vinne Jones his own action movie. His one liner's were great and the fight scene with the sniper about an hour and 10 minutes into the movie was the movies high point and pure Vinne Jones even topping the car door slamming scene from Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels. Jones is at his best playing this type of character. I'd also like to say that Alison King is a babe and deserves better than this and she is another plus for renting this. The direction by Anthony Hickox is terrible, Seagal's dialogue is terrible, as said in another review about 80% of his lines are dubbed, he sits down for most of the movie and we only ever see his fat face in half shadow, he wears massive leather coats regardless of the fact that he is supposedly in some very hot South American country while the locals wear t-shirts and look like they are sweating to death and you could start a drinking game while watching this called spot Seagals body double. Seagal also seems to have developed a bad case of torrets with a hilarious sudden outburst of c*ck sucker motherf**ker during one scene for no apparent reason and the line is delivered with the most energy I've heard Seagal deliver a line since probably Under Siege! It's also quite clear that Seagal is not even in the same room while supposedly delivering his lines to other actors and at times his dialogue doesn't make any sense. The spy plane at the beginning was the first of many laughs I got from the movie. It looked like something out of the Thunderbirds or from cut scene from Team America and for a minute I was wondering if I'd been given the right DVD at the rental store. All these things add up to an enjoyable 90 minutes with a few good laughs to be had at Seagals expense, the cheap special effects and Vinne Jones' character. I would probably recommend this as a rental only but I might pick it up cheap if I came across it in the bargain bin sometime in the future if only for Vinne Jones and that fight with the sniper.",2,It's a very VERY bad movie but I enjoyed it...........,1119398400,"06 22, 2005",2005,2356,"[""'ve"", 'just', 'rented', 'hard', 'one', 'rate', 'bad', 'film', 'almost', 'way', 'Vinne', 'Jones', 'who', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'whole', 'thing', 'however', 'having', 'said', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'probably', 'most', 'enjoyment', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Seagal', 'movie', 'second', 'Belly', 'Beast', 'Half', 'Past', 'Dead', ""'d"", 'also', 'like', 'say', 'could', 'someone', 'please', 'give', 'Vinne', 'Jones', 'own', 'action', 'movie', 'one', 'liner', 'were', 'great', 'fight', 'scene', 'sniper', 'hour', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'was', 'movies', 'high', 'point', 'pure', 'Vinne', 'Jones', 'even', 'topping', 'car', 'door', 'slamming', 'scene', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'Two', 'Smoking', 'Barrels', 'Jones', 'best', 'playing', 'type', 'character', ""'d"", 'also', 'like', 'say', 'Alison', 'King', 'babe', 'better', 'plus', 'renting', 'direction', 'Anthony', 'Hickox', 'terrible', 'Seagal', 'dialogue', 'terrible', 'said', 'review', '80', '%', 'lines', 'are', 'dubbed', 'down', 'most', 'movie', 'only', 'ever', 'see', 'fat', 'face', 'half', 'shadow', 'massive', 'leather', 'coats', 'regardless', 'fact', 'supposedly', 'very', 'hot', 'South', 'American', 'country', 'locals', 'wear', 't-shirts', 'look', 'are', 'sweating', 'death', 'could', 'start', 'drinking', 'game', 'watching', 'called', 'spot', 'Seagals', 'body', 'double', 'Seagal', 'also', 'have', 'developed', 'bad', 'case', 'torrets', 'hilarious', 'sudden', 'outburst', 'c*ck', 'sucker', 'motherf**ker', 'one', 'scene', 'apparent', 'reason', 'line', 'delivered', 'most', 'energy', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Seagal', 'deliver', 'line', 'probably', 'Siege', 'also', 'quite', 'clear', 'Seagal', 'not', 'even', 'same', 'room', 'supposedly', 'delivering', 'lines', 'other', 'actors', 'times', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'spy', 'plane', 'beginning', 'was', 'first', 'many', 'laughs', 'got', 'movie', 'looked', 'something', 'Thunderbirds', 'cut', 'scene', 'Team', 'America', 'minute', 'was', 'wondering', ""'d"", 'been', 'given', 'right', 'DVD', 'rental', 'store', 'things', 'add', 'up', 'enjoyable', '90', 'minutes', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'Seagals', 'expense', 'cheap', 'special', 'effects', 'Vinne', 'Jones', 'character', 'would', 'probably', 'recommend', 'rental', 'only', 'might', 'pick', 'up', 'cheap', 'came', 'bargain', 'bin', 'sometime', 'future', 'only', 'Vinne', 'Jones', 'fight', 'sniper']",N/A

Actually, I don't know if it is as bad as that or I'm just getting more annoyed with these low-quality Seagal flicks. However, Kill Switch (2008) is still the worst Seagal flick of this decade in my opinion, so far. I did like Flight of Fury (2007) only because there was some cool military aircraft and some nice-looking women and the story was kept quite simple. This movie didn't have any of those things. In fact the dvd synopsis was quite misleading as is the title. Though the title and the synopsis would make you believe that the majority of the film takes place on a submarine (I was sort of hoping for a Under Siege kind of deal on a sub), in fact they are only on the sub for about 20 minutes of the film. I think a lot of the submarine scenes probably got deleted in editing and they re-wrote in other parts of the story - that seems to happen to a lot of the Seagal flicks nowadays. Which also explains why we have .... yes, wait for it - obvious voice-dubbing. Granted it isn't as bad or noticeable as Attack Force (2006) but it is quite extensive throughout the film. And I really didn't care for the supporting cast in this film - it was like a collection of bad stereotypes, especially with the Luis character's fake accent. I mean come on, he's from East LA, he's a home boy, but he speaks with a phony accent like he's a native Spanish speaker from Madrid? Who's idea was that?! Of course that wasn't nearly as ridiculous as the fake model spy plane to start the movie. Wow! Did ya go down to Wal Mart and pick that little gem up from the toy section? Think so.The story. Well, it's not really worth telling. It sort of reminded me of the Manchurian Candidate at the outset, (I actually liked that movie), but it quickly got out of hand. This has been a problem with the writing on a lot of recent Seagal movies, which is why I liked Flight of Fury (2007) because it just kept things simple. This movie you kind of forget who is who, and who is killing who, and the action scenes don't always seem to match the storyline. What makes this movie even worse though is that you have very few scenes with Seagal showing-off his martial arts - it's a lot more gun fights and car chases, though not shot particularly well. At least Attack Force (2007) had a couple of decent-looking military-style shoot-out scenes, I didn't really see anything in this film that I liked.

I admit I rented this without even reading what it was about, just because it was a Seagal movie.I didn't have high expectations. Even so...After about 30 minutes I gave up.First off, for those of you who actually watch it, what's up with the super-dooper fakey spy plane in the beginning? The planes in ""Team America"" looked more realistic than this garbage.Also, they can afford to have a helicopter to shoot scenes in, but the background is so obviously computer generated? What a joke.And once again I wondered what the heck was going on when every scene that required a voice over dub by seagal was done by somebody who sounded NOTHING like seagal.Fighting? Not in this movie. Lots and lots of shooting though. For so called best-of-the-best professional soldiers, they couldn't hit the walls of a barn if they were standing inside the barn. There's one scene in which 200+ of the baddies with automatic weapons and a TANK are being held off by like 4 or 5 goodies with automatic machine-pistols. They're in a tunnel, like 100 feet from each other, firing hundreds if not thousands of rounds and like nobody gets hit? What a joke. One of the boring-ist scenes I've ever had to sit through. That's about when I called it quits.This movie is garbage. It's pure poop. It's too bad also, because even though everything since ""Exit Wounds"" in my opinion was poop, ""Into The Sun"" I thought was actually pretty good.I'll keep renting his movies just in the hopes that someday I'll actually enjoy one of his movies once again. So I suppose they'll keep churning out this poop because people like me will keep renting them. I'd imagine that they'll rent good, but I can't imagine any of his newer movies are being actually purchased. I guess his career is over, and I should get over it.

898222,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00083FZEU,trebe,"[1, 2]","There's a lot happening in Submerged (2005), an often confusing action film, set in Uruguay, starring Steven Seagal.  The story revolves around a process of mind control, where subjects can be programmed to kill on command.Chris Cody (Seagal) is pulled out a military prison, to lead a team of mercenaries on a mission to free a group of captured soldiers.  Doctor Adrian Lehder (Nick Brimble), the originator of the mind control process, is also on the mercenaries' hit list.  Included in the mission is Dr. Susan Chappell (Christine Adams), who has some knowledge of the secret mind altering process.The prisoners are being held at a base inside a dam, and with Cody's friend Damita's help, the group mounts an attack, spearheaded by Henry (Vinnie Jones).  Penetrating inside, the group manages to free the American prisoners, making an unlikely escape in a submarine.  Things get complicated, when the rescued soldiers, who have been exposed to the mind control treatment, turn against their rescuers.  The sub goes down to the bottom, but most of Cody's group manages to get back to shore safely.  Lehder the nutcase, is still on the loose, now involved in a plan to assassinate the President of Uruguay.Things here are something of a team effort, as Big Steve kind of takes a back seat for a while, as a mean and nasty Henry steps to the front, as the point man for delivering the mayhem.  With Christine Adams, and Alison King as Damita, there is a strong feminine presence, with both prepared for action.  In the home stretch, Cody comes to life, as Seagal slips his hero cape back on to impersonate the American ambassador to Uruguay, at a performance at the Montevideo opera house.  Following this, Cody single handedly wraps up the remaining loose ends.The action sequences are a mixed bag, as some are well done, while others are total flops.  The characters are mostly cartoonish, and the story a bit hard to follow at times, with some unexpected twists, and a traitor or two.  The dialog is frequently weak, with Seagal being dubbed in a few places.  With the supporting cast taking a more prominent role, Submerged is a slight change of pace, from the typical straight ahead Seagal action flick.  This may make it of interest to some that are not normally Seagal fans.",2,"an off kilter mission, with some unusual flavors for a Seagal flick . . .",1274572800,"05 23, 2010",2010,2282,"['lot', 'happening', 'Submerged', '2005', 'often', 'confusing', 'action', 'film', 'set', 'Uruguay', 'starring', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'story', 'around', 'process', 'mind', 'control', 'where', 'subjects', 'can', 'be', 'programmed', 'kill', 'command.Chris', 'Cody', 'Seagal', 'pulled', 'out', 'military', 'prison', 'lead', 'team', 'mercenaries', 'mission', 'free', 'group', 'captured', 'soldiers', 'Doctor', 'Adrian', 'Lehder', 'Nick', 'Brimble', 'originator', 'mind', 'control', 'process', 'also', 'mercenaries', 'hit', 'list', 'Included', 'mission', 'Dr.', 'Susan', 'Chappell', 'Christine', 'Adams', 'who', 'knowledge', 'secret', 'mind', 'altering', 'process.The', 'prisoners', 'are', 'being', 'held', 'base', 'dam', 'Cody', 'friend', 'Damita', 'help', 'group', 'attack', 'spearheaded', 'Henry', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'Penetrating', 'inside', 'group', 'free', 'American', 'prisoners', 'making', 'unlikely', 'escape', 'submarine', 'Things', 'get', 'complicated', 'when', 'rescued', 'soldiers', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'exposed', 'mind', 'control', 'treatment', 'turn', 'rescuers', 'sub', 'down', 'bottom', 'most', 'Cody', 'group', 'get', 'back', 'shore', 'safely', 'Lehder', 'nutcase', 'still', 'loose', 'now', 'involved', 'plan', 'assassinate', 'President', 'Uruguay.Things', 'here', 'are', 'something', 'team', 'effort', 'Big', 'Steve', 'kind', 'back', 'seat', 'while', 'mean', 'nasty', 'Henry', 'steps', 'front', 'point', 'man', 'delivering', 'mayhem', 'Christine', 'Adams', 'Alison', 'King', 'Damita', 'strong', 'feminine', 'presence', 'prepared', 'action', 'home', 'stretch', 'Cody', 'life', 'Seagal', 'hero', 'cape', 'back', 'impersonate', 'American', 'ambassador', 'Uruguay', 'performance', 'Montevideo', 'opera', 'house', 'Following', 'Cody', 'single', 'handedly', 'up', 'remaining', 'loose', 'ends.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'others', 'are', 'total', 'flops', 'characters', 'are', 'mostly', 'cartoonish', 'story', 'bit', 'hard', 'follow', 'times', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'traitor', 'two', 'dialog', 'frequently', 'weak', 'Seagal', 'being', 'dubbed', 'few', 'places', 'supporting', 'cast', 'taking', 'more', 'prominent', 'role', 'Submerged', 'slight', 'change', 'pace', 'typical', 'straight', 'ahead', 'Seagal', 'action', 'flick', 'may', 'make', 'interest', 'are', 'not', 'normally', 'Seagal', 'fans']",N/A

898224,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00083FZEU,Tsuyoshi,"[10, 10]","These days no one would expect much from direct-to-video films starring Steven Seagal. It was only five years ago (in 2001) when his `Exit Wounds' hit No. 1 in the US box office chart, and thanks to DMX that was a decent action film. It was a long time ago.`Submerged' is yet another B-film from Millennium Films directed by Anthony Hichox, known for B-horror/action films like `Waxwork' and `Jill Rips.' If you have seen the latter one featuring another direct-to-video star Dolph Lundgren (remember?), you know what you will see in `Submerged.' I can write it with one word - TERRIBLE.[BAD ACTIONS] `Submerged' has a wide assortment of terrible actions and vapid shoot-outs, plus incomprehensible story no one can understand, and as if they are not enough, very bad acting too. The last one could be forgiven if only Steven Seagal had listened to the advice of the people who know filmmaking better, and tried to lose some weight to look more like `action star' as he did before shooting `Exit Wounds.' Apparently he is too busy to do that, making as many as three or four films in a year.[BAD STORY] Now `Submerged' seems to be about the conspiracy in South America, where some terrible plot is going on, It looks like someone is using the high tech called ""mind control"" for no other reason than making some money. And this is yet to be confirmed, but someone is giving a help to the scientist to do a profitable business or something.[BAD, BAD, BAD] Add to this clich&eacute;d story, laconic Steven Seagal as `Cody' our hero released from the prison. As always, Chris Cody is assigned a mission from US Navy to attack the secret laboratory of the doctor. Chris Cody leads his `Dirty-Dozen' team only to find bits of tired actions, like bits of submarine scenes (where cheap version of `Under Siege' can be seen briefly), and another cheap version of Doris Day's `The Man Who Knew Too Much' with confusing editing and meaningless conclusion.[AND TRIVIA] Usually this kind of action is made with several set-pieces. If they are well-crafted, the numerous plot holes or bad acting can be ignored. In `Submerged' as the title suggests, everything - car crash, explosions (including that of miniatures), and shoot-outs are badly shot and poorly edited. You see distorted, cheesy CGI of `visions' of the brainwashed, or inexplicable fast-forward and slow motions, but they just don't make any sense. The fact that Hichox's mother Anne V. Coates is a respected film editor and four-time Oscar nominee (most recently for `Out of Sight') only makes me very sad about the poorly done editing of `Submerged.'And as to Steven Seagal, what can I say?  His acting is lazy and his action is slack, as if he doesn't want to do anything. Even the film's `Uruguay' is in fact Bulgaria, so no exotic location can be enjoyed. In short, this is a truly terrible film with no redeeming merits. Forget all about it.",1,"""We're Submerged."" ""So Am I!""

Personally, I summize that the negativeness is basically not only because he is tall and attractive, but also because he is a Master of his self-defense skills in real life and displays them well on film! Being 6'4"" in height helps him carry the additional weight quite well! Therefore, it bears no hendrance to the storyline at all which remains very enjoyable.

The director made it much more gritty, fast paced, and geared towards what I assume the young people appreciate today. As with other reviewers, I didn't hear the ""dubbed in dialogue"" that they were referring to. Also, with all the split screen and flashbacks, it all ties into the story.Anyway, Steven is a convict that must rescue some Americans and brings in some old friends who are very ba****ss.
