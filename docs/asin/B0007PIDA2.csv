886826,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0007PIDA2,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[2, 3]","Since Carol has already broken this workout down in detail, I'll just offer my impressions.  I was excited to try this workout given that I really like the older FitPrimes (including one led by the instructor here, Heidi Tanner) as well as the one other WHFN workout that I tried.  Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed in this workout.  On the one hand, it had many good points, but on the other, it seemed that each good point had an accompanying down side.  Here are my thoughts:*The warm-up was nice, although inexplicably labeled as ""cardio"" on the menu--it never really got to that level.  I also did enjoy the stretch which concludes the workout.*The aerobic effect of this workout was quite minimal.  The two 4-limb cardio segments (8 minutes total) were fun but not very intense; the second one in particular had some unique moves but was performed way too slowly for any aerobic benefit.*After the warm-up, you immediately go to the floor for core work, and I wasn't crazy about that sequencing.  I also wasn't quite sure if I was correctly incorporating the yoga block into the moves--Heidi does not spend much time discussing form--and I felt the work in different places than where Heidi said I should be feeling it.*I was really confused about what weights to use throughout the workout.  Heidi sometimes says ""heavy"" or ""light,"" but she never tells you what she's using, which would have been helpful.  There were times when I would have liked to go heavier with my weights, but the flow of the exercises made this difficult to do, and thus I often felt as if I wasn't working very hard.*Although I love using the tall step and didn't mind adding the yoga block and the stick, overall, the use of equipment in this workout felt awkward to me.*Finally, although I like Heidi, I really wish she had provided more details about form, especially for some of the more unique moves.  For example, I liked the idea of doing a plie squat with one foot on the step, but I just couldn't find a position where it felt right, and Heidi didn't say anything that helped.Overall, I didn't much enjoy this workout while doing it, and I didn't feel adequately worked out once it was over, which was especially disappointing given the length (49 minutes).  Although there might be a ""learning curve"" to getting the hang of the exercises--and I could certainly envision how the moves might be effective--I just don't think I'll feel motivated to do this workout again.",3,Review of Metaboost only,1140739200,"02 24, 2006",2006,2466,"['Carol', 'already', 'broken', 'workout', 'down', 'detail', ""'ll"", 'just', 'offer', 'impressions', 'was', 'excited', 'try', 'workout', 'given', 'really', 'older', 'FitPrimes', 'including', 'one', 'led', 'instructor', 'here', 'Heidi', 'Tanner', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'other', 'WHFN', 'tried', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'quite', 'disappointed', 'workout', 'one', 'hand', 'had', 'many', 'good', 'points', 'other', 'seemed', 'good', 'point', 'had', 'accompanying', 'down', 'side', 'Here', 'are', 'thoughts', '*The', 'warm-up', 'was', 'nice', 'inexplicably', 'labeled', 'cardio', 'menu', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'level', 'also', 'did', 'enjoy', 'stretch', 'workout', 'aerobic', 'effect', 'workout', 'was', 'quite', 'minimal', 'two', '4-limb', 'cardio', 'segments', '8', 'minutes', 'total', 'were', 'fun', 'not', 'very', 'intense', 'second', 'one', 'particular', 'had', 'unique', 'moves', 'was', 'performed', 'way', 'too', 'slowly', 'aerobic', 'benefit', '*After', 'warm-up', 'immediately', 'go', 'floor', 'core', 'work', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'sequencing', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'was', 'correctly', 'incorporating', 'yoga', 'block', 'moves', 'Heidi', 'not', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'discussing', 'form', 'felt', 'work', 'different', 'places', 'where', 'Heidi', 'said', 'should', 'be', 'feeling', '*I', 'was', 'really', 'confused', 'what', 'weights', 'use', 'workout', 'Heidi', 'sometimes', 'heavy', 'light', 'never', 'what', 'using', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'go', 'heavier', 'weights', 'flow', 'exercises', 'made', 'difficult', 'do', 'thus', 'often', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'working', 'very', 'hard', 'love', 'using', 'tall', 'step', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'adding', 'yoga', 'block', 'stick', 'overall', 'use', 'equipment', 'workout', 'felt', 'awkward', '*Finally', 'like', 'Heidi', 'really', 'wish', 'had', 'provided', 'more', 'details', 'form', 'especially', 'more', 'unique', 'moves', 'example', 'liked', 'idea', 'doing', 'plie', 'squat', 'one', 'foot', 'step', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'position', 'where', 'felt', 'right', 'Heidi', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'helped.Overall', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'enjoy', 'workout', 'doing', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'adequately', 'worked', 'out', 'was', 'was', 'especially', 'disappointing', 'given', 'length', '49', 'minutes', 'might', 'be', 'learning', 'curve', 'getting', 'hang', 'exercises', 'could', 'certainly', 'envision', 'how', 'moves', 'might', 'be', 'effective', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'motivated', 'do', 'workout', 'again']","FitPrime, Vol. 1: Metaboost and Flexposture"

The pace is slow, controlled and deliberate.  If you've got heavy weights, use them (I can see how someone sticking to light to medium weights would be frustrated).  I used 5 for the 4-limb cardio, 10 for biceps and shoulders, 15 for back and 20 for the leg work.  The next day I really felt it, particularly in my buttocks, legs and triceps.  Heidi Tanner, of Firm Cardio fame (and almost every parts workout the Firm released after that), cues very well here and calmly motivates the viewer to work hard.Flexposture, the other workout on this DVD, is a mostly Pilates/Yoga routine with some cardio and weights interspersed.  You don't think cardio and weights belong here?  Just go to the menu and pick the next yoga or Pilates tune.  As someone who taught Yoga and Pilates, I thought on preview that I would use the harder versions of the exercises when I did the tape.  However, I was so wiped out from Metaboost the previous day that for the most part I used the modifications.  It's not everything in the classic Pilates matwork syllabus (nor is it an exhaustive yoga practice) but I like what they include: most of the Stomach Series, Heel Beats, the Side Series, the Saw, the Spine Twist, Tree (Yoga Tree, not Pilates Tree), Cobra, Locust, Lying Boat, Half Bow and a bunch of setups that will be familiar to people who have taken live Pilates and yoga classes.  They also have a nifty series of pushups alternated with Child's Pose followed by Planks alternated with Child's Pose, working the upper body as well as the powerhouse.  Overall, I feel it's an effective workout, but I would have loved a little bit more stretch.  Tamela Hastie, from Firm Cardio Burn, leads this workout.  Her demeanor is almost unrecognizable- no ""This is Fun!"" or big huge smiles, but very serious, precise instruction.This is a keeper, and I'm loving the price.

I was disappointed in both the ""new"" Firm and the orginal Fit Prime.  I was also getting older and finding that the ""old""  Firms were just way too tough on my joints.Enter Anna with her new Fit Prime series...if you are in shape it keeps you in shape, and if you are not, it will get you there.  I'm 57 and am really enjoying the benefits of the whole new series..I have all 6 of them.  They are just tough enough and are very gentle on my joints.  The Flex Posture tape will be misunderstood by many unless you are of a certain age when flexibility becomes a concern.OK, Anna says that this set is specifically designed for the woman over 35, but in all reality, I think it would be better to say over 45 and closer to 50.

There are two aerobic/toning routines that are fresh and exciting (you don't repeat the same moves so it keeps interest level up).Metaboost is the more intense routine (they are litteraly helping you boost your metabolism) and in that segment, you use weights within the aerobic part to increase it's effectiveness.  Flex Posture is a barefoot routine that uses both pilates and yoga for flexibility.You will need a couple of items to help you in this workout (their fanny lifter, a foam block and your dumbells), but this is a good routine that does actually get results if you do them often enough.

I hung onto this DVD and gave it another chance. Now that I've increased the weights for this, it always has a place in my rotation. When Heidi does the first set of dips using no weights, I use a 15 lb. dumbell. For the leg presses and squats I use 15 lb. in each hand and for the one legged plies on the bench I use 20 lbs. on the tie-in of the working leg and 20 lbs on the opposite shoulder. For the hip rotation I use 20 lbs. on the working leg. This gives me a great workout-I'm working hard enough that my heart rate's up there and I feel I've worked everything. That's what I love about the Firm-I even keep some of the basic tapes for when I'm not feeling up to the ""gut-busting cardio"". I can use heavier weights & light weights for the cardio when they use none and I always feel I've gotten a decent workout.
