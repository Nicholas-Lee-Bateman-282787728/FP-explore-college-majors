Purnell,"[9, 9]","So many stories of religious figures add Halos that make it all unbelievable to me but this telling of Patrick's story is well done, dramatic and informative.  I like a good rebel story and this story of Patrick delivers.  Patrick is played as an admirable hero.  If you are curious about where Patrick came from, how he won the hearts, respect of Ireland or how he lived this is a fine telling of the story. Casting Liam Neeson (from Belfast) is a brilliant touch of Irish magic.Patrick",4,Nicely Done Story of our Favorite Saint!,1247011200,"07 8, 2009",2009,487,"['So', 'many', 'stories', 'religious', 'figures', 'add', 'Halos', 'make', 'unbelievable', 'telling', 'Patrick', 'story', 'well', 'done', 'dramatic', 'informative', 'good', 'rebel', 'story', 'story', 'Patrick', 'delivers', 'Patrick', 'played', 'admirable', 'hero', 'are', 'curious', 'where', 'Patrick', 'came', 'how', 'won', 'hearts', 'respect', 'Ireland', 'how', 'lived', 'fine', 'telling', 'story', 'Casting', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Belfast', 'brilliant', 'touch', 'Irish', 'magic.Patrick']",Patrick
1035509,A33WROIMGXTYMW,B000KQF6Z8,"Lee Freeman ""lfreeman_histgen""","[2, 2]","As has been said, this DVD is most likely the best documentary on Ireland's patron Saint that has been made to date.As has been said elsewhere, for one of the best-known saints, most people actually know very little about St. Patrick, Ireland's Patron Saint. This film should serve as a nice corrective to that. Forget the green beer and ""Kiss Me, I'm Irish"" buttons. This is the *real* inspiration behind St. Patrick's Day.Thankfully the film stays away from the subsequent myths and legends that grew up around Patrick (such as his driving the snakes out of Ireland; there were no snakes in Ireland when he arrived there) and focuses upon what we actually know about Patrick from ancient British and Irish historians as well as, primarily, from the Saint's two extant writings, his *Confessio,* similar to St. Augustine's *Confessions* and written near the end of Patrick's life, and the *Letter to Coroticus,* in which Patrick excommunicates a British chieftain named Coroticus who had kidnapped and enslaved a group of new converts of Patrick's.The documentary by award-winning director Pamela Mason Wagner, filmed entirely on location in Ireland, features an award-winning soundtrack and takes viewers through Patrick's life, from the teenage boy Patriciius' capture in his Roman Britain by Irish slavers and being sold into slavery, to his eventual escape from Ireland after receiving a vision from God, to his entrance into holy orders, to his return to Ireland as missionary-bishop (he replaced Bishop Palladius), his letter of excommunication of Coroticus, continuing on to his writing of his Confession, and eventual death.The film features lengthy interviews and commentary with/by Patrician scholars such as Sister Maire B. de Paor (*Patrick: Pilgrim Apostle of Ireland*), Philip Freeman (*Saint Patrick of Ireland: A Biography*), and Pultizer-Prize winning Irish author Frank McCourt (*Angela's Ashes*).The narration is done by Irish-American actor Liam Neeson (*Schindler's List*) with Gabriel Byrne (*The Usual Suspects*) as the voice of Patrick.This is a great movie for personal viewing, or a family devotional but would also work well in a church setting if your congregation has A-V equipment to show movies.I really can't recommend this film highly enough.",4,The Best Documentary on Patrick to Date,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",2013,2276,"['been', 'said', 'DVD', 'most', 'likely', 'best', 'documentary', 'Ireland', 'patron', 'Saint', 'been', 'made', 'date.As', 'been', 'said', 'elsewhere', 'one', 'best-known', 'saints', 'most', 'people', 'actually', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'St.', 'Patrick', 'Ireland', 'Patron', 'Saint', 'film', 'should', 'serve', 'nice', 'corrective', 'Forget', 'green', 'beer', 'Kiss', 'Me', ""'m"", 'Irish', 'buttons', '*real*', 'inspiration', 'St.', 'Patrick', 'Day.Thankfully', 'film', 'away', 'subsequent', 'myths', 'grew', 'up', 'Patrick', 'such', 'driving', 'snakes', 'Ireland', 'were', 'snakes', 'Ireland', 'when', 'arrived', 'there', 'what', 'actually', 'know', 'Patrick', 'ancient', 'British', 'Irish', 'historians', 'as', 'well', 'primarily', 'Saint', 'two', 'extant', 'writings', '*Confessio', '*', 'similar', 'St.', 'Augustine', '*Confessions*', 'written', 'end', 'Patrick', 'life', '*Letter', 'Coroticus', '*', 'Patrick', 'British', 'chieftain', 'named', 'Coroticus', 'who', 'had', 'kidnapped', 'enslaved', 'group', 'new', 'converts', ""Patrick's.The"", 'documentary', 'award-winning', 'director', 'Pamela', 'Mason', 'Wagner', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'location', 'Ireland', 'award-winning', 'soundtrack', 'viewers', 'Patrick', 'life', 'teenage', 'boy', 'Patriciius', 'capture', 'Roman', 'Britain', 'Irish', 'slavers', 'being', 'sold', 'slavery', 'eventual', 'escape', 'Ireland', 'receiving', 'vision', 'God', 'entrance', 'holy', 'orders', 'return', 'Ireland', 'missionary-bishop', 'replaced', 'Bishop', 'Palladius', 'letter', 'excommunication', 'Coroticus', 'continuing', 'writing', 'Confession', 'eventual', 'death.The', 'film', 'features', 'lengthy', 'interviews', 'commentary', 'with/by', 'Patrician', 'scholars', 'such', 'Sister', 'Maire', 'B.', 'de', 'Paor', '*Patrick', 'Pilgrim', 'Apostle', 'Ireland*', 'Philip', 'Freeman', '*Saint', 'Patrick', 'Ireland', 'Biography*', 'Pultizer-Prize', 'winning', 'Irish', 'author', 'Frank', 'McCourt', '*Angela', 'Ashes*', '.The', 'narration', 'done', 'Irish-American', 'actor', 'Liam', 'Neeson', '*Schindler', 'List*', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', '*The', 'Usual', 'Suspects*', 'voice', 'Patrick.This', 'great', 'movie', 'personal', 'viewing', 'family', 'devotional', 'would', 'also', 'work', 'well', 'church', 'setting', 'congregation', 'A-V', 'equipment', 'show', 'movies.I', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'highly', 'enough']",Patrick

I had thought that Liam Neeson was playing ""himself"" (meaning the Bishop of Armagh). He narrates the documentary.
