It's a terrific film to look at with a seedy ambience that'll keep you mesmerized.  Director Robert Kaylor uses the traveling carnival to explore the dark underbelly of American society.  Behind the ferris wheel and cotton candy lies the games of chance, parade of human oddities, and sexual exhibitions.  Gary Busey is terrific as the dunk tank clown who goads customers into throwing baseballs at him.  Robbie Robertson(of the Band) gives a creditable turn as the carnival promoter.  Jodie Foster, however, seems miscast as the townie who runs off with the carnival.  The makers also seem to exploit Foster more so than Martin Scorsese did in ""Taxi Driver"".  The film's end is rather unsavory that seems more at home in a slasher flick.

259772,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6301648846,Gregor von Kallahann,"[17, 23]","While reviewing some old tapes I was considering getting rid of in a yard sale, I found I was able to run my own little early-Jodie Foster film festival.  Well, a mini-festival anyway, since I stumbled on this one and FOXES.  And after, reviewing both, I'd have to concur with all those who find her early films quirky, entertaining and intriguing--but flawed as all get-out.CARNY is an atmospheric flick, one that captures the carnival milieu pretty well.  The acting is solid, with Jodie as the obvious stand-out.  Gary Busey and Robbie Robertson are also quite good, but their roles could use a bit of fleshing out.  As could the plot overall.  The film meanders along until someone decided to up the ante in the last twenty minutes. The last ditch effort to end the film with a  somewhat muted bang pretty much falls flat.  Probably, the film would have worked better strictly as the mood piece and character study it started out to be.But CARNY is still well worth your time.  As an unromanticized look into the world of traveling carnivals, it's pretty effective.  The three stars show a kind of promise that only Jodie Foster actually ever began to realize.  Robertson pretty much dropped out of acting after this not inauspicious debut, sad to say.  And the effect of Gary Busey's turbulent private life on his career has been fairly well documented.  Come to think of it, even Jodie Foster's career hasn't been all it could be--lots of interesting films, not that many great ones.

259774,AQ2RL6HTVI86T,6301648846,"J. Bridell ""Lost Johnny""","[6, 7]","I was born the same year as Jodie Foster.  I remember seeing her in various commercials, TV shows and movies as I was growing up.  She was the unofficial poster child for single parent families and independent, if somewhat dysfunctional children.  This film was made just as the 70's were ending and the 80's were starting.  I remember these days, the Carnival, what it was like.  One could learn a lot on the midway.  That when things look too good to be true they were, like the shiny switchblade knife that one could win, ""aren't they illegal"" I asked, ""illegal is a sick bird"".  I will never know if the knife worked, one could not win it, it was fixed.  Freak shows and hoochy coochy dancers, people trying to make a living, or people being exploited?  Who could say?  Those who knew best decided to clean up the midway, but can anyone tell me if there is less exploitation, cheating, and dirty dealing without the midway?  I lost some money but I got an education that saved me more money in the long run, that's gone now and the world is worse for it.  By far and away the star of the show is the 17-year young Jodie Foster, the little girl who was in the Disney films had come of age, oh how she came of age!  Her dancehall outfit is a classic that will never be repeated, as was the girl/women inside it just like the rest of us, she was growing up.  The film is well paced, perfectly cast (they simply took a real carnival and shot there),  and all too believable, you don't need to make up characters like Donna, Bozo, Gary Busey in his best role ever and Robbie Robinson as the low level manager who collects money and keeps ""rubes"" in line with his trusty straight razor, there was a kind of justice there that one does not see anywhere else, another world where different rules apply.  A place for the disenfranchised, the ugly and the beautiful, in one unforgettable scene, the ""fat Lady"" stands alone in the rain, relishing her chance to take an all over shower.  Such simple images say so much.  Like all classics, it becomes more poignant with age.  Of all of Busy's and Fosters films, none were better or more telling then this, and of all the Characters Jodie Foster has played before or since, none is more important, none is better.  It's a shame that other of Ms. Fosters films that don't come close to this, Svengali, Blood of Others, etc have been made into DVD, but this gem sits and waits, perhaps it is an irony that the prize we see behind the counter is the one we cannot win.",5,A world that is gone forever.....I think,1157760000,"09 9, 2006",2006,2506,"['was', 'born', 'same', 'year', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'remember', 'seeing', 'various', 'commercials', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'unofficial', 'poster', 'child', 'single', 'parent', 'families', 'independent', 'somewhat', 'dysfunctional', 'children', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'just', '70', 'were', 'ending', '80', 'were', 'starting', 'remember', 'days', 'Carnival', 'what', 'was', 'One', 'could', 'learn', 'lot', 'midway', 'when', 'things', 'look', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'were', 'shiny', 'switchblade', 'knife', 'one', 'could', 'win', 'are', ""n't"", 'illegal', 'asked', 'illegal', 'sick', 'bird', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'knife', 'worked', 'one', 'could', 'not', 'win', 'was', 'fixed', 'Freak', 'shows', 'hoochy', 'coochy', 'dancers', 'people', 'trying', 'make', 'living', 'people', 'being', 'exploited', 'Who', 'could', 'say', 'who', 'knew', 'best', 'decided', 'clean', 'up', 'midway', 'can', 'anyone', 'tell', 'less', 'exploitation', 'cheating', 'dirty', 'dealing', 'midway', 'lost', 'money', 'got', 'education', 'saved', 'more', 'money', 'long', 'run', 'gone', 'now', 'world', 'worse', 'far', 'away', 'star', 'show', '17-year', 'young', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'Disney', 'films', 'had', 'come', 'age', 'oh', 'how', 'came', 'age', 'dancehall', 'outfit', 'classic', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'repeated', 'was', 'girl/women', 'just', 'rest', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'film', 'well', 'paced', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'simply', 'took', 'real', 'carnival', 'shot', 'there', 'too', 'believable', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'make', 'up', 'characters', 'Donna', 'Bozo', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'best', 'role', 'ever', 'Robbie', 'Robinson', 'low', 'level', 'manager', 'who', 'money', 'rubes', 'line', 'trusty', 'straight', 'razor', 'was', 'kind', 'justice', 'one', 'not', 'see', 'anywhere', 'else', 'world', 'where', 'different', 'rules', 'apply', 'place', 'disenfranchised', 'ugly', 'beautiful', 'one', 'unforgettable', 'scene', 'fat', 'Lady', 'alone', 'rain', 'relishing', 'chance', 'take', 'shower', 'Such', 'simple', 'images', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'classics', 'more', 'poignant', 'age', 'Busy', 'Fosters', 'films', 'none', 'were', 'better', 'more', 'telling', 'then', 'Characters', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'played', 'none', 'more', 'important', 'none', 'better', 'shame', 'other', 'Ms', 'Fosters', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'Svengali', 'Blood', 'Others', 'etc', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'DVD', 'gem', 'waits', 'perhaps', 'irony', 'prize', 'see', 'counter', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'win']",N/A

I wish that the relationship between Frankie and Patch had been fleshed out more to show how they entered their peculiar double-act, but a fascinating double-act it is.

I've never seen Taxi Driver, so for me the effect of seeing Donna's Baptism by Fire into Carny life was chilling and powerful. This VHS is let down by the muddy audio - the DVD issue can't come soon enough! But overall, this movie is watchable.
