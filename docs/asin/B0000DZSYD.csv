780390,A3DAVP1SKSENQ7,B0000DZSYD,Victrola Man,"[0, 0]",This is a great CLEAN show about an English priest (Peter Clifford) sent as local priest to the Ballykissangel Church. His attempts to lead God's flock gets intermingled with the other characters who meet at the local public house (Fitzgeralds) run by agnostic Asumpta Fitzgerald who has a disregard for the Church - but is inching toward re-birth as a parishoner (my opinion) because of respect for Father Clifford. Add &#34;money & fame schemer&#34; Brian Quigley and his 2 ner-do-well employees to the mix and you've got a great and fun show.,5,Funny and captivating small Irish town life,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,545,"['great', 'CLEAN', 'show', 'English', 'priest', 'Peter', 'Clifford', 'sent', 'local', 'priest', 'Ballykissangel', 'Church', 'attempts', 'lead', 'God', 'flock', 'intermingled', 'other', 'characters', 'who', 'meet', 'local', 'public', 'house', 'Fitzgeralds', 'run', 'agnostic', 'Asumpta', 'Fitzgerald', 'who', 'disregard', 'Church', 'inching', 're-birth', 'parishoner', 'opinion', 'respect', 'Father', 'Clifford', 'Add', '34', 'money', 'fame', 'schemer', '34', 'Brian', 'Quigley', '2', 'ner-do-well', 'employees', 'mix', ""'ve"", 'got', 'great', 'fun', 'show']",N/A
