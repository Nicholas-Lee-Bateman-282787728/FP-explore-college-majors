He is dealing not only with the struggles of his disability but also with the uncertainties of whether he will ever find someone who will love him in spite of it.He meets a young man named Dean (Jack Kesy) who lost his father and then put his life on hold to care for his mother who recently passed away after suffering with cancer. Can this young man offer Morgan the love he desires so deeply?Unlike many other indie films that are fraught with stale jokes, old cliches, and nauseating stereotypes, this movie is a triumph of the human spirit, a testament to true and unconditional love, and comfort food for the heart and soul.I love this movie.

1578875,A2IF6UKZCV0V0Y,B008YUHQEG,"C. Clay ""drakkar91""","[0, 0]","For certain, 'Morgan' is one of the most unique love stories I have ever viewed. A slightly slow start, the film quickly moves forward, and soon, our lead character Morgan meets Dean at the basketball court.  A quirky but cute first date arrives, and soon a genuine and rare story unfolds.  Love not based on sex or status, but on two people who desire the deepest of emotions to connect.  With only 90 minutes from start to finish, we really cannot fully analyze the connection, but suffice to say, it seems real.  Soon, your emotions are tugged, as the two experience 'flying on a cloud' and 'butterflies' as their relationship develops.  Their performances are strong and believable.The only other key actors are the best friend and Morgan's mother - neither of which are particularly grand, but at least the friend breaks up the somewhat serious aspect of the film.  I have to admit, I found it hard to believe this character playing Morgan's Mother could have really been related!  But, the focus on Morgan and Dean was key, so I could tend to overlook it.Unfortunately (as another review points out), the second half starts to derail. While I'm OK with a bit of derailment, unfortunately, it goes way too far.  Our lead Morgan rapidly goes from a kind-hearted sweet (and challenged man) to a very stubborn (even hateful) guy.  But in a flash, emotions pour out, and he quickly makes amends with his mother, best friend, and Dean.  All the build up of the first half is unfortunately lost in this dismal effort at (I assume) adding dramatic effect?  As the film comes to a close, the Brady Bunch-esque finish no longer captures or tugs at my heart strings.What was a solid 4-star film (often 5-stars) erodes with this uncharacteristic change of events.  I completely lost my connection with the main character, and the ending almost became predictable.  Would I recommend it? Yes, but with hesitation.  The storyline is unique, and the love story (as it starts and develops) is refreshing.  But the second half falters and many a viewer will disconnect or at least find it predictable and/or annoying.  Overall, it's an excellent effort for an independent production, but the attempt to mimic typical mainstream gay stories diminishes an otherwise great work.",3,"Unique and Charming Love Story, But Derails Rapidly",1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,2264,"['certain', ""'Morgan"", 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'love', 'stories', 'have', 'ever', 'viewed', 'slightly', 'slow', 'start', 'film', 'quickly', 'forward', 'soon', 'lead', 'character', 'Morgan', 'Dean', 'basketball', 'court', 'quirky', 'cute', 'first', 'date', 'arrives', 'soon', 'genuine', 'rare', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Love', 'not', 'based', 'sex', 'status', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'desire', 'deepest', 'emotions', 'connect', 'only', '90', 'minutes', 'start', 'finish', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'fully', 'analyze', 'connection', 'suffice', 'say', 'real', 'Soon', 'emotions', 'are', 'tugged', 'two', 'experience', ""'flying"", 'cloud', ""'butterflies"", 'relationship', 'performances', 'are', 'strong', 'believable.The', 'only', 'other', 'key', 'actors', 'are', 'best', 'friend', 'Morgan', 'mother', 'neither', 'are', 'particularly', 'grand', 'least', 'friend', 'up', 'somewhat', 'serious', 'aspect', 'film', 'have', 'admit', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'character', 'playing', 'Morgan', 'Mother', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'related', 'focus', 'Morgan', 'Dean', 'was', 'key', 'could', 'tend', 'overlook', 'it.Unfortunately', 'review', 'out', 'second', 'half', 'derail', ""'m"", 'OK', 'bit', 'derailment', 'unfortunately', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'lead', 'Morgan', 'rapidly', 'kind-hearted', 'sweet', 'challenged', 'man', 'very', 'stubborn', 'even', 'hateful', 'guy', 'flash', 'emotions', 'pour', 'out', 'quickly', 'amends', 'mother', 'best', 'friend', 'Dean', 'build', 'first', 'half', 'unfortunately', 'lost', 'dismal', 'effort', 'assume', 'adding', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'film', 'close', 'Brady', 'Bunch-esque', 'finish', 'no', 'longer', 'tugs', 'heart', 'strings.What', 'was', 'solid', '4-star', 'film', 'often', '5-stars', 'uncharacteristic', 'change', 'events', 'completely', 'lost', 'connection', 'main', 'character', 'ending', 'almost', 'became', 'predictable', 'Would', 'recommend', 'Yes', 'hesitation', 'storyline', 'unique', 'love', 'story', 'develops', 'refreshing', 'second', 'half', 'falters', 'many', 'viewer', 'will', 'disconnect', 'least', 'find', 'predictable', 'and/or', 'annoying', 'Overall', 'excellent', 'effort', 'independent', 'production', 'attempt', 'mimic', 'typical', 'mainstream', 'gay', 'stories', 'otherwise', 'great', 'work']",Morgan

Morgan is content to drink beer and live off disability while his understanding but annoying Mother (Madalyn McKay)offers whatever support is needed. Morgan and Dean's relationship proceeds nicely, if a little quickly, until Morgan decides to enter the race that crippled him the previous year (In a specially fitted bike). As Morgan trains and gets physically stronger, he becomes emotionally embittered and pushes everyone, including Dean, away. Finally, Morgan realizes he can't do it all and reconciles with an understanding Dean and a forgiving Mother. It's the predictable ending that tarnishes this engaging effort.

Martin,"[11, 12]","The first half of this movie is very good, refreshingly low-key and original, with a believable, slowly-developing romance between Morgan and Dean in Inwood, the far northern tip of Manhattan almost never seen in movies. The relaxed, small-town, almost rural character of the place is a welcome change from the frantic pace, hard-edged greed and shallow posturing that dominate in the more fashionable areas downtown where most movies are made. The city used to have many such low-key neighborhoods that we never see in movies, so it's good to see this one while it still exists.Unfortunately, the movie sort of disintegrates in its second half. Producers Akers and Berg must have thought a simple love story would be too boring, so they shoehorned a boatload of dramatic tension into the gentle, lovely story and ruined it. There are no gay-beating thugs, which is the stock drama-injector in gay movies, and its absence here is a great relief; but the absurd and highly annoying behavior of the main character is even more infuriating in a different, if much less hackneyed, way.A consistent delight throughout the movie, though, is Jack Kesy's gentle but powerful performance as Dean.
