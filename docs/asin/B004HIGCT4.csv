Other than one quick, largely anti-climactic scene, there's no correlation with the cover and the movie contents.  Second, while the concept was generally interesting, it completely lacked punch throughout. The movie was definitely professionally done and has high production values, but the film just meanders scene to scene without bringing it all together, resulting in one blah bit after another.  Additionally, the film tries to create a sense of constant confusion due to the siren affecting the characters thoughts.  While this idea had great promise, it also fell flat.  Rather than creating dramatic confusion and unease, it created simple actual confusion that unnecessarily and completely devolved the film into a incomprehensible narrative.  To some degree, its almost worth a rental, especially if you've gone through the usual fare, just don't expect a great story.",2,Just not interesting,1304380800,"05 3, 2011",2011,928,"['First', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'cover', 'art', 'Other', 'one', 'quick', 'largely', 'anti-climactic', 'scene', 'correlation', 'cover', 'movie', 'contents', 'Second', 'concept', 'was', 'generally', 'interesting', 'completely', 'lacked', 'punch', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'professionally', 'done', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'just', 'meanders', 'scene', 'scene', 'bringing', 'together', 'resulting', 'one', 'blah', 'bit', 'Additionally', 'film', 'tries', 'create', 'sense', 'constant', 'confusion', 'due', 'siren', 'affecting', 'characters', 'thoughts', 'idea', 'had', 'great', 'promise', 'also', 'fell', 'flat', 'Rather', 'creating', 'dramatic', 'confusion', 'unease', 'created', 'simple', 'actual', 'confusion', 'unnecessarily', 'completely', 'devolved', 'film', 'incomprehensible', 'narrative', 'degree', 'almost', 'rental', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'usual', 'fare', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'great', 'story']",Siren

They discover a secluded island with an injured man, and a mysterious woman with a dark secret. The longer they remain on the island, the more the friends experience a twisted blur between nightmares and reality.The good news about the movie is that it was filmed entirely off the coast of Tunisia in Northern Africa, so we're treated to beautiful scenes of the beach and ocean. Director Andrew Hull has a few other low-budget movies under his belt, and the production quality of Siren is a bit better than most Redbox flicks. Despite most of the cast having only appeared in a few obscure movies, they do a decent job in this film.The bad news is that the film is filled with plot holes. Even the first five minutes of the film, before the sailing trip begins, includes a creepy bathroom scene that is never explained nor revisited. While some mystery is good, and can create suspense, the film becomes annoying near the conclusion due to a lack of explanations. Even the dialogue stops making sense as the movie draws to a close.Keep in mind that this movie doesn't really reflect the Sirens of Greek mythology, so even knowing their story doesn't give you the full picture. The only way I discovered what the plot was really about was by checking out the deleted scenes in the DVD extras. For reasons that I'll never understand, a clip titled ""Tale of the Siren"" was removed from the movie. It offers an explanation of who the mysterious girl is, her connection to one of the travelers, and why tragedy befalls visitors to the island. It's only after watching the deleted scene that the story and certain scenes make sense, but by then I was a bit disappointed with the movie.There's a bit of gore in the movie, though it's nothing along the lines of being a ""slasher"" flick. There are also a few sex scenes, though there's oddly no frontal nudity in the movie. The DVD cover really has nothing to do with the film, either.Overall, I wasn't impressed with this movie. If you plan on renting it, it's a must that you watch the deleted scenes afterwards if you want a better understanding of the story. Give this one a rent before you even consider buying it.",2,Plot Holes Make for a Disappointing Movie,1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,2394,"['Siren', 'step', 'film', 'quality', 'most', 'straight-to-video', 'movies', 'weak', 'story', 'plagued', 'plot', 'holes', 'confusing', 'film.Siren', 'story', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'make', 'weekend', 'getaway', 'sailing', 'coast', 'discover', 'secluded', 'island', 'injured', 'man', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'dark', 'secret', 'longer', 'remain', 'island', 'more', 'friends', 'experience', 'twisted', 'blur', 'nightmares', 'reality.The', 'good', 'news', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'coast', 'Tunisia', 'Northern', 'Africa', ""'re"", 'treated', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'beach', 'ocean', 'Director', 'Andrew', 'Hull', 'few', 'other', 'low-budget', 'movies', 'belt', 'production', 'quality', 'Siren', 'bit', 'better', 'most', 'Redbox', 'flicks', 'most', 'cast', 'having', 'only', 'appeared', 'few', 'obscure', 'movies', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'film.The', 'bad', 'news', 'film', 'filled', 'plot', 'holes', 'Even', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'sailing', 'trip', 'creepy', 'bathroom', 'scene', 'never', 'explained', 'revisited', 'mystery', 'good', 'can', 'create', 'suspense', 'film', 'annoying', 'conclusion', 'due', 'lack', 'explanations', 'Even', 'dialogue', 'making', 'sense', 'movie', 'close.Keep', 'mind', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'reflect', 'Sirens', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'so', 'even', 'knowing', 'story', ""n't"", 'give', 'full', 'picture', 'only', 'way', 'discovered', 'what', 'plot', 'was', 'really', 'was', 'checking', 'out', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'extras', 'reasons', ""'ll"", 'never', 'understand', 'clip', 'titled', 'Tale', 'Siren', 'was', 'removed', 'movie', 'explanation', 'who', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'connection', 'one', 'travelers', 'why', 'tragedy', 'visitors', 'island', 'only', 'watching', 'deleted', 'scene', 'story', 'certain', 'scenes', 'make', 'sense', 'then', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'movie.There', 'bit', 'gore', 'movie', 'nothing', 'lines', 'being', 'slasher', 'flick', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'sex', 'scenes', 'oddly', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'movie', 'DVD', 'cover', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'film', 'either.Overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'movie', 'plan', 'renting', 'must', 'watch', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'afterwards', 'want', 'better', 'understanding', 'story', 'Give', 'one', 'rent', 'even', 'consider', 'buying']",Siren

This movie makes no sense. It is based on the premise that rescuing people can be dangerous. The filmmakers may have tried to create the suspense of movies like ""Triangle,"" as the film starts out on a boat (well, after a role-playing scene in the desert that makes absolutely no sense anyway), and then ends up on an island. On the island, it turns into a snooze-fest. Nothing happens until the very end, and the reason for the ending was never really explained. Looking at the cover art for the movie, you'd expect to see a ton of nudity and gore, and there is absolutely none. At least it could have been suspenseful, but the writers/directors couldn't even give us that. And it was so poorly acted that the transitions between visions and reality could not even be depicted at times by those viewing the film.

So if I tried to explain the movie, you wouldn't get what it was about, then after watching it, you would realize that I told you everything. There just wasn't much there. I wanted to try and give it two stars, but I couldn't do it in good conscience. If you are looking for an American remake of a Japanese movie of the same name, this isn't it. The name is, I suppose, a coincidence. Fortunately, I wasn't looking for that. If you are interested in something sexy as the cover photo implies, that basically fell extremely short too. There was a bit implied, but nothing really there either. As for it possibly being a horror movie, I just didn't find anything interesting enough to catch my attention and, as such movies go, there wasn't anything that scary or suspenseful.There wasn't any background information to know what was going on with the ""evil"" lady they come into contact with on the island and the characters left a bit to be defined also.

1408676,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B004HIGCT4,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[3, 4]","Three friends on a boating cruise find themselves encountering a Siren - a beautiful female creature from Greek mythology who lures sailors to their deaths - on an isolated island in ""Siren"", perhaps the most under-rated movie to be released in recent memory.Two men and a woman - the girlfriend of one of the guys - are on a voyage on gorgeous waters, but a voyage already underlined by tension within the group - the other male member of the crew is the former flame of the boat's female occupant, and her current beau is the paranoid, rather controlling type.  When the small crew comes across an island deep in the sea with a bedraggled man on the coast desperately waving for help, they go to his aid.  But the castaway - delirious, fearstruck, and speaking a language they don't understand - goes into convulsions and dies as the boat attempts to sail away from the island.  In what could be seen as an illogical move, rather than simply report the death to local authorities, the trio - afraid of being blamed for the castaway's condition and death - decide to return to the island and bury him in an annonymous grave.  I don't think this is necessarily as big a flaw in reasoning as it may seem; the Siren of the film exerts a subtle but strong influence on the minds of those around her, and this sudden phobia and excuse to return to the island brings the trio right back to her.  Once returned, they encounter the woman 'Silka', not knowing what she really is.  The island seems to be a paradise, but it hasn't yet set in that this is a paradise they may never be able to leave.The nature of the Siren, though certain revelations and hints come out, is never fully explained.  Though she seems to thrive off the lifeforce of people she strands on the island, she doesn't appear to be truly evil.  More spider-like, perhaps - to the fly trapped in a spider's web, spinning that web right where flies are likely to get caught up in it would probably seem pretty mean; to the spider it's just doing what comes naturally.  The movie is atmospheric, sexy, and a visual feast.  The island/ocean setting is gorgeous, and full of striking moments.  There's one scene of Silka and Rachel walking towards the ocean under a moonlit sky that's particularly memorable.  The island itself is vibrant and utopian, although other parts of it appear much sparser, almost stunted - the question arises from this and from other moments, how much of the island is precisely the way the trio is perceiving it, and how much is the Siren's physcic influence?  There's even a vague feeling there may actually be more than one reality of the island overlapping one another.Siren has elements of a horror movie, a thriller, a fantasy movie and a drama, although it doesn't fit any field precisely.  Though that may be part of the reason for the movie's less-than-stellar reception, for fans who love genre-hybrid movies (such asThe Invisible,The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series),Blood Riverand Altitude), this is a terrific treat.",5,"Terribly Under-Rated Gem - Sexy, Atmospheric And Suspenseful",1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,3023,"['Three', 'friends', 'boating', 'cruise', 'find', 'encountering', 'Siren', 'beautiful', 'female', 'creature', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'who', 'sailors', 'deaths', 'isolated', 'island', 'Siren', 'perhaps', 'most', 'under-rated', 'movie', 'be', 'released', 'recent', 'memory.Two', 'men', 'woman', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'guys', 'are', 'voyage', 'gorgeous', 'waters', 'voyage', 'already', 'underlined', 'tension', 'group', 'other', 'male', 'member', 'crew', 'former', 'flame', 'boat', 'female', 'occupant', 'current', 'beau', 'paranoid', 'rather', 'controlling', 'type', 'When', 'small', 'crew', 'island', 'deep', 'sea', 'bedraggled', 'man', 'coast', 'desperately', 'waving', 'help', 'go', 'aid', 'castaway', 'delirious', 'fearstruck', 'speaking', 'language', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'convulsions', 'dies', 'boat', 'sail', 'away', 'island', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'illogical', 'move', 'rather', 'simply', 'report', 'death', 'local', 'authorities', 'trio', 'afraid', 'being', 'blamed', 'castaway', 'condition', 'death', 'decide', 'return', 'island', 'bury', 'annonymous', 'grave', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'necessarily', 'as', 'big', 'flaw', 'reasoning', 'may', 'seem', 'Siren', 'film', 'subtle', 'strong', 'influence', 'minds', 'sudden', 'phobia', 'excuse', 'return', 'island', 'trio', 'right', 'back', 'Once', 'returned', 'encounter', 'woman', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'really', 'island', 'be', 'paradise', ""n't"", 'yet', 'set', 'paradise', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'leave.The', 'nature', 'Siren', 'though', 'certain', 'revelations', 'hints', 'come', 'out', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'thrive', 'off', 'lifeforce', 'people', 'island', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'truly', 'evil', 'More', 'spider-like', 'perhaps', 'fly', 'trapped', 'spider', 'web', 'spinning', 'web', 'right', 'where', 'flies', 'are', 'likely', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'would', 'probably', 'seem', 'pretty', 'mean', 'spider', 'just', 'doing', 'what', 'naturally', 'movie', 'atmospheric', 'sexy', 'visual', 'feast', 'island/ocean', 'setting', 'gorgeous', 'full', 'striking', 'moments', 'one', 'scene', 'Silka', 'Rachel', 'walking', 'towards', 'ocean', 'moonlit', 'sky', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'island', 'vibrant', 'utopian', 'other', 'parts', 'appear', 'much', 'sparser', 'almost', 'stunted', 'question', 'other', 'moments', 'how', 'much', 'island', 'precisely', 'way', 'trio', 'perceiving', 'how', 'much', 'Siren', 'physcic', 'influence', 'even', 'vague', 'feeling', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'more', 'one', 'reality', 'island', 'overlapping', 'one', 'another.Siren', 'elements', 'horror', 'movie', 'thriller', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'drama', ""n't"", 'fit', 'field', 'precisely', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'reason', 'movie', 'less-than-stellar', 'reception', 'fans', 'who', 'love', 'genre-hybrid', 'movies', 'such', 'asThe', 'Invisible', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Series', 'Blood', 'Riverand', 'Altitude', 'terrific', 'treat']",Siren
