Now, I have become decensatized to all kinds of CG movies. ""HM2000"" has an ok look to it. It has a pointlis plot that tends to build up on its self threw out the whole movie. I like HM2000's plot twist at the end were this new enemy shows up and takes what ever it is, that the movie is about. The shoot out sceen at the strip bar was some stylish action for shore. The music in the movie brings back naustalgic memories of when I saw it with my old highschool budys. Yet a little taim.

554591,A37XGUQ1VH0XM6,B00004WG2E,"OAKSHAMAN ""oakshaman""","[10, 13]","I'll give you a measure of how forgettable one of these films was- I bought the new release of the original Heavy Metal and Heavy Metal 2000 at the same time. I found myself remembering almost every scene in the original movie, even though I hadn't seen it in over 20 years. Then I watched HM2000. About halfway through I vaguely recalled that I had seen it before, but there wasn't one single scene that I clearly remembered- and I probably only saw it about three years ago. It was that forgettable, that ordinary.Don't get me wrong; this isn't necessarily a bad film. The animation is very well done, very slick and seamless. The writing and voice acting is competent and professional. The sound track is certainly better incorporated into the animation and story than it was in the original. Everything was competently done, it was just.... ordinary. Nothing jumped out at you. It was like a Saturday morning cartoon episode- just with a little more violence, and a lot more animated nudity (animated nudity- I mean what's the point?)Personally, I'd save my money and buy the new release of the original Heavy Metal- alone. Sure, the animation looks crude by today's standards- but it was done the old, time-consuming, expensive way of drawing one cell at a time. The original was also crammed full of a variety of different animation styles and story lines. Perhaps that was because it was the first big budget science fiction animated feature and the people involved had so much enthusiasm that they tried to do too much. In contrast, I don't think anyone got too enthusiastic about this film. Sure, they did a solid job of craftsmanship, but where is the originality, the fire, the spirit? Kind of reminds me of the original Heavy Metal magazine, it started out fresh and new and just slowly petered out to nothing....",3,"One classic, one NOT!",1077667200,"02 25, 2004",2004,1825,"[""'ll"", 'give', 'measure', 'how', 'forgettable', 'one', 'films', 'was-', 'bought', 'new', 'release', 'original', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'Heavy', 'Metal', '2000', 'same', 'time', 'found', 'remembering', 'almost', 'scene', 'original', 'movie', 'even', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', '20', 'years', 'Then', 'watched', 'HM2000', 'halfway', 'vaguely', 'recalled', 'had', 'seen', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'single', 'scene', 'clearly', 'remembered-', 'probably', 'only', 'saw', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'forgettable', 'ordinary.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'film', 'animation', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'slick', 'seamless', 'writing', 'voice', 'acting', 'competent', 'professional', 'sound', 'track', 'certainly', 'better', 'incorporated', 'animation', 'story', 'was', 'original', 'Everything', 'was', 'competently', 'done', 'was', 'just', 'ordinary', 'Nothing', 'jumped', 'out', 'was', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'episode-', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'violence', 'lot', 'more', 'animated', 'nudity', 'animated', 'nudity-', 'mean', 'what', 'point', 'Personally', ""'d"", 'save', 'money', 'buy', 'new', 'release', 'original', 'Heavy', 'Metal-', 'alone', 'Sure', 'animation', 'crude', 'today', 'standards-', 'was', 'done', 'old', 'time-consuming', 'expensive', 'way', 'drawing', 'one', 'cell', 'time', 'original', 'was', 'also', 'crammed', 'full', 'variety', 'different', 'animation', 'styles', 'story', 'lines', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'was', 'first', 'big', 'budget', 'science', 'fiction', 'animated', 'feature', 'people', 'involved', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'enthusiasm', 'tried', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'contrast', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'got', 'too', 'enthusiastic', 'film', 'Sure', 'did', 'solid', 'job', 'craftsmanship', 'where', 'originality', 'fire', 'spirit', 'Kind', 'reminds', 'original', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'magazine', 'started', 'out', 'fresh', 'new', 'just', 'slowly', 'petered', 'out', 'nothing']",Heavy Metal / Heavy Metal 2000 - Set

554593,A2C4EG9LRTNQW1,B00004WG2E,Thomas A. Holmes,"[25, 27]","I began buying HEAVY METAL magazine when it was first introduced in our country (it is based on the French magazine METAL HURLANT), and when I saw the first HEAVY METAL movie in its theatrical release, I considered it a pretty good representation of the magazine--funny, bizarre, sexy in a playful way, and open to various types of artistic interpretation. The DVD of HEAVY METAL appeals to me because it preserves the characteristics that made those early years of the magazine special.HEAVY METAL 2000, however, is little more than a vanity project for Julie Strain, the wife of the current publisher of HEAVY METAL and one of the producers of the film, Kevin Eastman. One would think that Eastman, who gained fame as one of the creators of the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, would present a new HEAVY METAL film that would have the same qualities as the original. But where HM offers violence to illustrate the depth of evil, HM2K focusses on the gore. Where HM offers a forum for various stylistic approaches, HM2K offers jarring combinations of animation techniques. Where HM tantalizes viewers with sexuality, HM2K invites us to leer. HM2K defines &quot;gratuitous&quot; in every scene and, in doing so, seemingly confirms every dirty stereotype about arrested adolescence in grown-ups who read comics. The only redeemable portion of the HM2K DVD is the bio on Julie Strain--the pure unintended camp of the piece is fascinating. But HM2K as a whole offers a predictable story with voice acting less animated than the standard digital recording on an answering machine. If you're looking for a recent sci-fi movie that captures the knowing, satirical and adventurous spirit of the first HM movie, buy STARSHIP TROOPERS. HM2K did not get theatrical distribution for a reason, folks. Take the hint.I give this item two stars because the movies are bundled together. HM by itself is worth four stars, and HM2K deserves none.",2,HM2K Is Not Worth Your Attention,990748800,"05 25, 2001",2001,1934,"['began', 'buying', 'HEAVY', 'METAL', 'magazine', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', 'country', 'based', 'French', 'magazine', 'METAL', 'HURLANT', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'HEAVY', 'METAL', 'movie', 'theatrical', 'release', 'considered', 'pretty', 'good', 'representation', 'magazine', 'funny', 'bizarre', 'sexy', 'playful', 'way', 'open', 'various', 'types', 'artistic', 'interpretation', 'DVD', 'HEAVY', 'METAL', 'appeals', 'characteristics', 'made', 'early', 'years', 'magazine', 'special.HEAVY', 'METAL', '2000', 'however', 'little', 'more', 'vanity', 'project', 'Julie', 'Strain', 'wife', 'current', 'publisher', 'HEAVY', 'METAL', 'one', 'producers', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Eastman', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'Eastman', 'who', 'gained', 'fame', 'one', 'creators', 'original', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'would', 'present', 'new', 'HEAVY', 'METAL', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'same', 'qualities', 'original', 'where', 'HM', 'violence', 'illustrate', 'depth', 'evil', 'HM2K', 'gore', 'Where', 'HM', 'forum', 'various', 'stylistic', 'approaches', 'HM2K', 'jarring', 'combinations', 'animation', 'techniques', 'Where', 'HM', 'viewers', 'sexuality', 'HM2K', 'leer', 'HM2K', 'quot', 'gratuitous', 'quot', 'scene', 'doing', 'so', 'seemingly', 'dirty', 'stereotype', 'arrested', 'adolescence', 'grown-ups', 'who', 'read', 'comics', 'only', 'redeemable', 'portion', 'HM2K', 'DVD', 'bio', 'Julie', 'Strain', 'pure', 'unintended', 'camp', 'piece', 'fascinating', 'HM2K', 'whole', 'predictable', 'story', 'voice', 'acting', 'less', 'animated', 'standard', 'digital', 'recording', 'answering', 'machine', ""'re"", 'looking', 'recent', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'knowing', 'satirical', 'adventurous', 'spirit', 'first', 'HM', 'movie', 'buy', 'STARSHIP', 'TROOPERS', 'HM2K', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'theatrical', 'distribution', 'reason', 'folks', 'Take', 'hint.I', 'give', 'item', 'two', 'stars', 'movies', 'are', 'bundled', 'together', 'HM', 'worth', 'four', 'stars', 'HM2K', 'none']",Heavy Metal / Heavy Metal 2000 - Set
