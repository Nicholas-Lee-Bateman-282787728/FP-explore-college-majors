However, I did not give it five stars because of the Flat Belly Fast feature at the end.  I started doing it 7 weeks after I delivered my son because my Dr. said I could.  Well the lady who does the Flat Belly Fast bonus feature is not the same lady who does the Prenatal Pilates through out the rest of the DVD.  I'm pretty sure she was never even pregant in her life!  It is extremely hard (in my opinion)and I ended up finding out I had a hernia after doing it.  I'm not sure if I already had the hernia or if I got it doing the DVD.

1081682,A2NYLGHJ9RNKGK,B000RIWARG,bmkd,"[299, 304]","After a shaky first trimester, my doctor gave me the ok to exercise again. I started shopping for a good, fun workout DVD. I tried the ""Buff Moms-to-be"" workout - don't bother with that one. Way to wimpy. Next, I got the ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" DVD. I love that workout. By far my favorite. However, there isn't much core work involved, so I thought I'll get a pilates DVD, so I can alternate workouts. So, I ordered ""Pilates during Pregnancy."" That workout is way too brutal. It made me hurt all over, and not in a good way. Finally, I ordered the ""10-Minute Solution Prenatal Pilates"" DVD. Oh, how I love this workout. The whole body gets a workout. Every muscle in your body is working. The workout is just right - not too wimpy and not too hard. Very doable. You'll feel great afterwards. The instructor is very pleasant, and the background is very inviting. The music is there, but not overpowering. There are five 10 minute sections: Standing Pilates, Core Pilates, Pilates for Buns & Thighs, Total Body Pilates, and Pilates for Flexibility (my favorite). You can select the ""Play All"" feature, or you can create your own workout by selecting only the sections you want to do. I recently started some physical therapy for my sciatica, and the therapist commented on how great my muscle tone is, especially in my core. I told her about this DVD, and she told me to keep it up, since it seems to work well. I'm now 34 weeks pregnant, and I will continue to use this DVD and ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" as long as I can.A number of people have raised some concerns about some of the exercises on this DVD that are done laying on your back. First of all, the amount of time you spend on your back is extremely short. A couple of minutes at the most. I spend more time laying on my back during ultrasounds. Also, the physical therapist gave me some exercises to do at home for my sciatica, and those exercises have me laying flat on my back for 3-5 minutes, so it can't be that bad. Also, while you are laying on your back, during this workout, you are moving around, so I could imagine that prevents blockage of blood flow. But, you need to do what you feel comfortable with. I would definitely recommend this DVD for a great pre-natal workout.",5,I love this workout,1218240000,"08 9, 2008",2008,2258,"['shaky', 'first', 'trimester', 'doctor', 'gave', 'ok', 'exercise', 'again', 'started', 'shopping', 'good', 'fun', 'workout', 'DVD', 'tried', 'Buff', 'Moms-to-be', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'one', 'Way', 'wimpy', 'Next', 'got', 'Perfect', 'Pregnancy', 'Workout', 'DVD', 'love', 'workout', 'far', 'favorite', 'However', ""n't"", 'much', 'core', 'work', 'involved', 'thought', ""'ll"", 'get', 'pilates', 'DVD', 'can', 'alternate', 'workouts', 'So', 'ordered', 'Pilates', 'Pregnancy', 'workout', 'way', 'too', 'brutal', 'made', 'hurt', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'Finally', 'ordered', '10-Minute', 'Solution', 'Prenatal', 'Pilates', 'DVD', 'Oh', 'how', 'love', 'workout', 'whole', 'body', 'workout', 'muscle', 'body', 'working', 'workout', 'just', 'right', 'not', 'too', 'wimpy', 'not', 'too', 'hard', 'Very', 'doable', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'great', 'afterwards', 'instructor', 'very', 'pleasant', 'background', 'very', 'inviting', 'music', 'there', 'not', 'overpowering', 'are', 'five', '10', 'minute', 'sections', 'Standing', 'Pilates', 'Core', 'Pilates', 'Pilates', 'Buns', 'Thighs', 'Total', 'Body', 'Pilates', 'Pilates', 'Flexibility', 'favorite', 'can', 'select', 'Play', 'All', 'feature', 'can', 'create', 'own', 'workout', 'selecting', 'only', 'sections', 'want', 'do', 'recently', 'started', 'physical', 'therapy', 'sciatica', 'therapist', 'commented', 'how', 'great', 'muscle', 'tone', 'especially', 'core', 'told', 'DVD', 'told', 'keep', 'up', 'work', 'well', ""'m"", 'now', '34', 'weeks', 'pregnant', 'will', 'continue', 'use', 'DVD', 'Perfect', 'Pregnancy', 'Workout', 'as', 'long', 'can.A', 'number', 'people', 'have', 'raised', 'concerns', 'exercises', 'DVD', 'are', 'done', 'laying', 'back', 'First', 'all', 'amount', 'time', 'spend', 'back', 'extremely', 'short', 'couple', 'minutes', 'most', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'laying', 'back', 'ultrasounds', 'Also', 'physical', 'therapist', 'gave', 'exercises', 'do', 'home', 'sciatica', 'exercises', 'have', 'laying', 'flat', 'back', '3-5', 'minutes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'Also', 'are', 'laying', 'back', 'workout', 'are', 'moving', 'around', 'could', 'imagine', 'prevents', 'blockage', 'blood', 'flow', 'need', 'do', 'what', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'great', 'pre-natal', 'workout']",10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates

I need those extra reminders to engage the TVA - CORRECTLY - to ensure I am not setting myself up for diastis recti, which impacts 1/3 of all first time pregnancies (if not more).

During the core section, you are supposed to use pillows to ensure that your head stays above your heart.  At another time you only lay on your back while you are rolling your hips side to side.  From what I learned form the Dr. and reading elsewhere, its ok to excersise on your back if you are elevated at EITHER the hips or shoulders/head.

So I tried out a few prenatal pilates DVD's. Making a good pilates pregnancy workout is difficult because a lot of pilates exercises are very core challenging, are done on a flat back, and include fast paced breathing, all of which is great if you aren't pregnant or in your first trimester. Most of the videos I tried were either entirely unsafe or not even worth taking the time to do because they were so easy. This video is Ok, I am in the second trimester and did the whole video straight through, It was an OK workout. The Buns & Thighs, Standing, and Flexibility sections are 5 star short workouts, the other three are 3 to 4 star workouts.My concern is only in one of the six workouts on the video. The core pilates. 100% safe for your first trimester. However, in your second trimester you must modify the exercises and splint your abs on half the exercises. As seen inGabrielle Reece: The Complete Fit and Healthy Pregnancy. If you don't your abs will begin to split apart. This was never addressed in this video.  Also in your third trimester I would recommend omitting any of the exercises that feel uncomfortable, or cause dizziness. Some people where concerned about lying on your back to do these exercises, as long as you feel good doing them you should be OK. In the Core section she has you doing the exercises supported by pillows so you will not be on a flat back, and it is only about 5 minutes. Though out the video their is a minimum of flat back work.If you want to try a Pilates wourkout video I would strongly give 5 stars check out, Jillian Moriarty's Prenatal Fitness (Pre/Postnatal Yoga & Pilates Workouts), by Parents, you can find it at Target.

1081693,A3J87CR5E2KT3R,B000RIWARG,JGH,"[2, 2]","I am 6 months pregnant with my first baby and would consider myself a pretty active person.  Pre-pregnancy I would run about 10-15 miles a week and do barre-method ballet workouts 2x/week and then a very intense strength training session once a week.  I am quite fit and have good muscle tone and a strong core.  I continued my normal routine for the first trimester, simply skipping any jumping-rope or trampoline based exercises.  By my second trimester, I began to worry that perhaps I wasn't doing appropriate workouts for my &#34;condition&#34;, as my belly has popped out now and is definitely a bit in the way.  I also was at the stage where laying on your back for extended periods of time was no longer medically sound for the baby - so I moved onto specifically prenatal workouts (in addition to continuing my cardio which I switched from running to the elliptical).  I have four prenatal DVDs that I ordered here on Amazon:- this one (10 min prenatal pilates solutions)-suzanne bowens long and lean-summer sanders prenatal-suzanne bowens barre workoutThose are in order from easiest to most challenging (IMO).  This DVD is quite mild and doesn't ever make me sweat or feel intensity, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I save it for a day of the week where I'm feeling lazy and would be proud of myself to accomplish anything at all, but am not up to the challenge of one of the other work outs.

I feel very relaxed and like I got a good stretch in after I've completed this DVD-  but like I said, I don't feel like I worked out.If you're a beginner at exercise, this may be right up your alley.  The only thing that worries me is whether we should be doing crunches, etc while pregnant -- I've heard that you shouldn't if you want to avoid diastasic recti (which we obviously all do). She does have pillows supporting her though, so the crunches/roll-ups are much less intense than they would be otherwise.All in all, I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a very mild, calming exercise routine -- just don't expect to get an intense work out, and you won't be disappointed :)",4,Good if you're not used to exercising much!,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,2348,"['am', '6', 'months', 'pregnant', 'first', 'baby', 'would', 'consider', 'pretty', 'active', 'person', 'Pre-pregnancy', 'would', 'run', '10-15', 'miles', 'week', 'do', 'barre-method', 'ballet', '2x/week', 'then', 'very', 'intense', 'strength', 'training', 'session', 'once', 'week', 'am', 'quite', 'fit', 'have', 'good', 'muscle', 'tone', 'strong', 'core', 'continued', 'normal', 'routine', 'first', 'trimester', 'simply', 'skipping', 'jumping-rope', 'trampoline', 'based', 'exercises', 'second', 'trimester', 'began', 'worry', 'perhaps', 'was', ""n't"", 'doing', 'appropriate', 'workouts', '34', 'condition', '34', 'belly', 'popped', 'out', 'now', 'definitely', 'bit', 'way', 'also', 'was', 'stage', 'where', 'laying', 'back', 'extended', 'periods', 'time', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'medically', 'sound', 'baby', 'so', 'moved', 'specifically', 'prenatal', 'workouts', 'addition', 'continuing', 'cardio', 'switched', 'running', 'elliptical', 'have', 'four', 'prenatal', 'DVDs', 'ordered', 'here', 'Amazon', 'one', '10', 'min', 'prenatal', 'pilates', 'solutions', '-suzanne', 'bowens', 'long', 'lean-summer', 'sanders', 'prenatal-suzanne', 'bowens', 'workoutThose', 'are', 'order', 'easiest', 'most', 'challenging', 'IMO', 'DVD', 'quite', 'mild', ""n't"", 'ever', 'make', 'sweat', 'feel', 'intensity', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'save', 'day', 'week', 'where', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'lazy', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'accomplish', 'anything', 'am', 'not', 'challenge', 'one', 'other', 'work', 'outs', 'Lizbeth', 'easy', 'follow', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'may', 'miss', 'out', 'rep', 'two', 'watching', 'find', 'proper', 'form', 'third', 'time', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'easily', 'needing', 'constantly', 'study', 'movements', 'feel', 'very', 'relaxed', 'got', 'good', 'stretch', ""'ve"", 'completed', 'DVD-', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'worked', 'out.If', ""'re"", 'beginner', 'exercise', 'may', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'only', 'thing', 'worries', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'crunches', 'etc', 'pregnant', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'should', ""n't"", 'want', 'avoid', 'diastasic', 'recti', 'obviously', 'do', 'have', 'pillows', 'supporting', 'though', 'crunches/roll-ups', 'are', 'much', 'less', 'intense', 'would', 'be', 'otherwise.All', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'looking', 'very', 'mild', 'calming', 'exercise', 'routine', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'get', 'intense', 'work', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates

I was expecting a tough pilates workout to make my muscles feel a burn, but that's not what I got from this.  Many of the moves just didn't feel good and made me concerned about injuries.  I decided to skip the entire core workout, because I've been dealing with round ligament pain and didn't want to make that worse.  I also didn't want to lie on my back that long.  Taking that out leaves you with 40 minutes of workout, 10 of which is stretching.  I also skipped that, because I was just frustrated by that point.  There were also a couple other exercises I skipped, because of the lying on your back worry.  Maybe if I could have done the entire workout it would have been better, but I don't think so.  I didn't feel like many of these moves worked much at all.  There was one part of the thigh and buns section that made me feel like I was working something, as did some of the arm exercises in the total body section.  But, other than that, it just didn't do it for me.  To give you an idea on level/intensity, I run 3-4 times a week and do strength or yoga twice a week.  I considered myself to be at an intermediate level, maybe a little higher.  If you want a good strength workout, I would suggest the Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol. 1 with Karyne Steben.

1081707,A3KUH4O2S6EEEG,B000RIWARG,Texi,"[13, 18]","I really enjoy this workout and used it quite regularly through most of my pregnancy. The thing I LOVE about it is the option to customize the order/number of segments.  This was really helpful on days I was feeling tired... I could tell myself ""I'll just do 10 minutes today"", so the thought of working out wasn't overwhelming.One area of concern however involves the Core segment.  Unless you already have extremely fit abs, I think this section can cause more harm than good.  In the latter half of pregnancy, you are more prone to abdominal separation (aka diastasis recti), and the exercises in this segment--especially the crunches--can bring on this condition.  I was doing the core workout faithfully until around 25 weeks when I noticed a freakish-looking vertical ""ridge"" extending down the length of my midsection every time I crunched. (Very disturbing!)  It was simply too much strain on the rectus abdominus muscles and they were beginning to separate as a result.This is still a great workout dvd, but I do NOT recommend the core segment after 20 weeks.  Do standing ab crunches instead, and always keep the belly button pulled in tight during any exercise that utilizes the abs.

1081708,A3QUU0LQN5XD36,B000RIWARG,"The Princess ""princessjen""","[15, 19]","First I'll start by subjecting myself to some net scrutiny. I'm overweight. I was overweight before I got pregnant by about 40lbs. (It was only thirty, but the Freshmen 15 is a determined threat no matter what age you start college lol.) When I realized I was pregnant, I was determined NOT to gain an ungodly amount of weight this time around. 15lbs is my goal and I'm happy to report that as I approach my 23rd week I've only gained 8 lbs. This of course is due in part to pregnancy metabolism, 2 mile walks and now Prenatal Pilates. I've never been real big on the twist, stretch, raise and hold type workouts, (AKA anything Yoga and Pilates related) but the 10 Minute Solution reviews were impossible to ignore. Almost every one I read included something like, 'I felt great after this work out' and 'The instructions were fast paced and easy to follow.' This is especially important to someone like me. I'm not gonna lie I went into this DVD expecting to hate it as I hated all things bendy, but man was I wrong! I'm sitting in my living room, computer on lap, writing this review after my very first, very awesome 10 minute workout. I feel absolutely revitalized not to mention accomplished. My muscles are pulsing and a smidge sore, but nothing outrageous. The overhaul of exhaustion that normally hits after starting a new regimen has been replaced with a shocking amount of energy. At the menu page I chose the Total Body workout and let me tell you even if the rest of the DVD sucks this one routine made it well worth buying. You're going from the second it comes on. The fast pace and easy instructions work you without working you into the ground. I've never had this much fun exercising. Ever. I've looked high and low for something that would make me feel the way I feel today. I've ordered other Prenatal DVD's and researched until I'm blue in the face, but that's all over now. Take it from a pregnant, overweight Pilates hater like me; the 10 minute solution is exactly that; the solution. Good luck to you all, and have a happy, healthy pregnancy.",5,Pregnant Pilates for Dummies!!!,1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,2066,"['First', ""'ll"", 'start', 'subjecting', 'net', 'scrutiny', ""'m"", 'overweight', 'was', 'overweight', 'got', 'pregnant', '40lbs', 'was', 'only', 'thirty', 'Freshmen', '15', 'determined', 'threat', 'matter', 'what', 'age', 'start', 'college', 'lol', 'When', 'realized', 'was', 'pregnant', 'was', 'determined', 'NOT', 'gain', 'ungodly', 'amount', 'weight', 'time', 'around', '15lbs', 'goal', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'approach', '23rd', 'week', ""'ve"", 'only', 'gained', '8', 'lbs', 'course', 'due', 'part', 'pregnancy', 'metabolism', '2', 'mile', 'walks', 'now', 'Prenatal', 'Pilates', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'real', 'big', 'twist', 'stretch', 'raise', 'hold', 'type', 'workouts', 'AKA', 'anything', 'Yoga', 'Pilates', 'related', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'reviews', 'were', 'impossible', 'ignore', 'one', 'read', 'included', 'something', 'felt', 'great', 'work', ""'The"", 'instructions', 'were', 'fast', 'paced', 'easy', 'follow', 'especially', 'important', 'someone', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'lie', 'went', 'DVD', 'expecting', 'hate', 'hated', 'things', 'bendy', 'man', 'was', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'sitting', 'living', 'room', 'computer', 'lap', 'writing', 'review', 'very', 'first', 'very', 'awesome', '10', 'minute', 'workout', 'feel', 'absolutely', 'revitalized', 'not', 'mention', 'accomplished', 'muscles', 'are', 'pulsing', 'smidge', 'sore', 'nothing', 'outrageous', 'overhaul', 'exhaustion', 'normally', 'starting', 'new', 'regimen', 'been', 'replaced', 'shocking', 'amount', 'energy', 'menu', 'page', 'chose', 'Total', 'Body', 'workout', 'let', 'tell', 'even', 'rest', 'DVD', 'one', 'routine', 'made', 'well', 'buying', ""'re"", 'going', 'second', 'fast', 'pace', 'easy', 'instructions', 'work', 'working', 'ground', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'much', 'fun', 'exercising', 'Ever', ""'ve"", 'looked', 'high', 'low', 'something', 'would', 'make', 'feel', 'way', 'feel', 'today', ""'ve"", 'ordered', 'other', 'Prenatal', 'DVD', 'researched', ""'m"", 'blue', 'face', 'over', 'now', 'Take', 'pregnant', 'overweight', 'Pilates', 'hater', '10', 'minute', 'solution', 'exactly', 'solution', 'Good', 'luck', 'have', 'happy', 'healthy', 'pregnancy']",10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates
1081709,A3JGIMBV5KO34M,B000RIWARG,"Thoughtful ""Thoughtful""","[0, 0]","This video is perfect for working pregnant moms!  At only 10 minutes per segment it can easily be made a part of almost any day.The segments-my favorite was the total body segment.  It really tones your muscles and is challenging without being too hard and it doesn't require any equipment except dumbbells.  It also doesn't require you to lay on your back which has worried some reviewers although I agree with another one that none of the segments require laying on the back as much as ultrasounds do.  My next favorite segment is the standing pilates.  It also just requires weights and requires no laying on your back.  The flexibility segment is nice and soothing.  The buns and thighs segment seems to give your lower body a good workout without hurting and has really seemed to aid in helping my hip pain that I've had prior to now starting my third trimester.  The Core Pilates segment is fine too.  It requires pillows and is probably the one I do least often only because I like the other ones so much, especially the Total Body segment.  I'd recommend this tape for that one alone.Also, the instructor is very knowledgeable without being annoying and she's obviously very pregnant.",5,great purchase!,1258675200,"11 20, 2009",2009,1192,"['video', 'perfect', 'working', 'pregnant', 'moms', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'segment', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'made', 'part', 'almost', 'day.The', 'segments-my', 'favorite', 'was', 'total', 'body', 'segment', 'really', 'muscles', 'challenging', 'being', 'too', 'hard', ""n't"", 'require', 'equipment', 'dumbbells', 'also', ""n't"", 'require', 'lay', 'back', 'worried', 'reviewers', 'agree', 'one', 'none', 'segments', 'require', 'laying', 'back', 'as', 'much', 'ultrasounds', 'do', 'My', 'next', 'favorite', 'segment', 'standing', 'pilates', 'also', 'just', 'weights', 'laying', 'back', 'flexibility', 'segment', 'nice', 'soothing', 'buns', 'thighs', 'segment', 'give', 'lower', 'body', 'good', 'workout', 'hurting', 'really', 'seemed', 'aid', 'helping', 'hip', 'pain', ""'ve"", 'had', 'prior', 'now', 'starting', 'third', 'trimester', 'Core', 'Pilates', 'segment', 'fine', 'too', 'pillows', 'probably', 'one', 'do', 'least', 'often', 'only', 'like', 'other', 'ones', 'so', 'much', 'especially', 'Total', 'Body', 'segment', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'tape', 'one', 'alone.Also', 'instructor', 'very', 'knowledgeable', 'being', 'annoying', 'obviously', 'very', 'pregnant']",10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates
