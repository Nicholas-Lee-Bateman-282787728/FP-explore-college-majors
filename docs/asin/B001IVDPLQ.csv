1204686,A1KFWSYZIOBI3Y,B001IVDPLQ,"DaRRen ""Darren""","[1, 2]","I am surprised that this movie does not have more reviews. I found it quite enjoyable. The young lead actor is quite good, as are the actors who played the slimy congressman and his complicated nephew. The movie portrays innocence lost. A young man who is a high achiever and who has faith in the nation's political system learns that many inside the system are absolutely corrupt and that they shield each other from exposure. The young boy's journey was realistic in many ways -- aside from his oblivious parents.A WORD OF CAUTION: Please ignore the reviewer who says this movie is perverse and that it is about sexual slavery. That person is wildly mistaken and not that intelligent. In fact, he or she isn't intelligent at all. The movie is obviously too deep for that person to understand or appreciate. Please do not allow that terrible review to keep you from watching this captivating independent and low-budget film.",4,This is a delightful film.,1327190400,"01 22, 2012",2012,925,"['am', 'surprised', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'more', 'reviews', 'found', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'young', 'lead', 'actor', 'quite', 'good', 'are', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'slimy', 'congressman', 'complicated', 'nephew', 'movie', 'innocence', 'lost', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'high', 'achiever', 'who', 'faith', 'nation', 'political', 'system', 'many', 'system', 'are', 'absolutely', 'corrupt', 'shield', 'other', 'exposure', 'young', 'boy', 'journey', 'was', 'realistic', 'many', 'ways', 'aside', 'oblivious', 'parents.A', 'WORD', 'OF', 'CAUTION', 'Please', 'ignore', 'reviewer', 'who', 'movie', 'perverse', 'sexual', 'slavery', 'person', 'wildly', 'mistaken', 'not', 'intelligent', 'fact', ""n't"", 'intelligent', 'movie', 'obviously', 'too', 'deep', 'person', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'Please', 'do', 'not', 'allow', 'terrible', 'review', 'keep', 'watching', 'captivating', 'independent', 'low-budget', 'film']",Choose Connor
1204687,A129PCCR3F6J2Y,B001IVDPLQ,"Elliot ""Son of Nietzsche""","[5, 8]","15-year-old Owen, an academic, friendless (yet oddly-confident) young male, is excited to meet Congressman Lawrence Connor at the former's middle-school graduation. Owen grabs the Congressman's attention with his grasp of current affairs, and is asked to become the 'youth spokesman' for the Congressman's campaign for Senator. This is a dream-come-true for Owen, since he has imagined a political future for himself. He quickly becomes immersed into the spectacle of sound-bites and empty imagery, but is seduced by the attention, media appearances and high-flying parties with politicians.Meanwhile, Owen is developing a close friendship with the Congressman's attractive, privileged nephew, Caleb - who, two years older than Owen, is sensual and worldly-wise in a way that Owen has never been. Despite Caleb's hints that Owen's new world is nothing like it seems, Owen is blinded by the sparkle of institutional power - and is headed for an abrupt fall.'Choose Connor' is concerned with illuminating the self-serving malevolence of politicians, through the eyes of a nave young male. Writer/Director Luke Eberle does an accomplished and professional job with this age-old theme, and in the process flirts with some important messages (the system will always protect itself; the need to make symbolic sacrifices) that always deserve an airing. The problem is that the efficacy is wholly undermined by the *vehicle* which he deploys to illustrate Owen's 'awakening': sex, a tired clich&eacute;, which is more a sop to popular cultural delectation than anything authentic or subversive. The story of the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" is a timeless theme; sex as a negative force existing outside of politics itself is a empty one. Paradoxically, therefore, the film ends up by *conforming* to the very institutionalized power relations that Eberle was concerned to undermine; as a consequence, 'Choose Connor' will quickly fade from memory.The cast generally do well with the material available to them - in particular, Steven Weber is excellent as the consummate, self-aggrandizing, politician; experienced Alex D. Linz (Owen) and relative newcomer Escher Holloway (Caleb), turn in strong performances, despite the one-dimensionality of their characters. Watch 'Choose Connor' for an evening's entertainment - just don't expect anything seminal.",3,Institutional politics and a shattered dream,1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,2340,"['15-year-old', 'Owen', 'academic', 'friendless', 'yet', 'oddly-confident', 'young', 'male', 'excited', 'meet', 'Congressman', 'Lawrence', 'Connor', 'former', 'middle-school', 'graduation', 'Owen', 'grabs', 'Congressman', 'attention', 'grasp', 'current', 'affairs', 'asked', 'become', ""'youth"", 'spokesman', 'Congressman', 'campaign', 'Senator', 'dream-come-true', 'Owen', 'imagined', 'political', 'future', 'quickly', 'immersed', 'spectacle', 'sound-bites', 'empty', 'imagery', 'seduced', 'attention', 'media', 'appearances', 'high-flying', 'parties', 'politicians.Meanwhile', 'Owen', 'developing', 'close', 'friendship', 'Congressman', 'attractive', 'privileged', 'nephew', 'Caleb', 'who', 'two', 'years', 'older', 'Owen', 'sensual', 'worldly-wise', 'way', 'Owen', 'never', 'been', 'Caleb', 'hints', 'Owen', 'new', 'world', 'nothing', 'Owen', 'blinded', 'sparkle', 'institutional', 'power', 'headed', 'abrupt', 'fall', ""'Choose"", 'Connor', 'concerned', 'illuminating', 'self-serving', 'malevolence', 'politicians', 'eyes', 'nave', 'young', 'male', 'Writer/Director', 'Luke', 'Eberle', 'accomplished', 'professional', 'job', 'age-old', 'theme', 'process', 'flirts', 'important', 'messages', 'system', 'will', 'always', 'protect', 'need', 'make', 'symbolic', 'sacrifices', 'always', 'deserve', 'airing', 'problem', 'efficacy', 'wholly', 'undermined', '*vehicle*', 'illustrate', 'Owen', ""'awakening"", 'sex', 'tired', 'clich', 'eacute', 'more', 'sop', 'popular', 'cultural', 'delectation', 'anything', 'authentic', 'subversive', 'story', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Clothes', 'timeless', 'theme', 'sex', 'negative', 'force', 'existing', 'politics', 'empty', 'one', 'Paradoxically', 'therefore', 'film', 'up', '*conforming*', 'very', 'institutionalized', 'power', 'relations', 'Eberle', 'was', 'concerned', 'undermine', 'consequence', 'Connor', 'will', 'quickly', 'fade', 'memory.The', 'cast', 'generally', 'do', 'well', 'material', 'available', 'particular', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'excellent', 'consummate', 'self-aggrandizing', 'politician', 'experienced', 'Alex', 'D.', 'Linz', 'Owen', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'Escher', 'Holloway', 'Caleb', 'turn', 'strong', 'performances', 'one-dimensionality', 'characters', 'Watch', 'Connor', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'seminal']",Choose Connor
1204688,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B001IVDPLQ,J. Martin,"[1, 2]","Choose Connor is a fairly well-written and -directed and very well-acted movie about an extraordinarily idealistic, isolated and naive 15-year-old boy, whose whole life has been spent studying alone, and who after graduation from middle school almost magically becomes intimately involved in the final month of a high-stakes (for US Senator) political campaign. When he discovers that politics is hypocritical, he becomes huffy and self-righteous and withdraws back into his familiar and idealistic bookish isolation.That core story is very well done, but many details in the movie are so preposterous that they undermine its overall effectiveness. The totally implausible way he goes overnight from book-bound, middle-school nerd to political operative is absurd, but it's not too hard to accept because what follows is interesting. But when a major subplot of sexual predation rears its horror-movie, cartoonishly demonic and COMPLETELY unbelievable head, the interesting story becomes too ridiculous to accept.That's too bad. There's enough good in this movie to watch it anyway, as long as you can overlook the preposterous parts.",3,"Naive, idealistic kid becomes disillusioned with politics",1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,1134,"['Choose', 'Connor', 'fairly', 'well-written', '-directed', 'very', 'well-acted', 'movie', 'extraordinarily', 'idealistic', 'isolated', 'naive', '15-year-old', 'boy', 'whole', 'life', 'been', 'spent', 'studying', 'alone', 'who', 'graduation', 'middle', 'school', 'almost', 'magically', 'intimately', 'involved', 'final', 'month', 'high-stakes', 'US', 'Senator', 'political', 'campaign', 'When', 'politics', 'hypocritical', 'huffy', 'self-righteous', 'withdraws', 'back', 'familiar', 'idealistic', 'bookish', 'isolation.That', 'core', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'many', 'details', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'preposterous', 'undermine', 'overall', 'effectiveness', 'totally', 'implausible', 'way', 'overnight', 'book-bound', 'middle-school', 'nerd', 'political', 'operative', 'absurd', 'not', 'too', 'hard', 'accept', 'what', 'interesting', 'when', 'major', 'subplot', 'sexual', 'predation', 'horror-movie', 'cartoonishly', 'demonic', 'COMPLETELY', 'unbelievable', 'head', 'interesting', 'story', 'becomes', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'too', 'bad', 'enough', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'anyway', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'overlook', 'preposterous', 'parts']",Choose Connor
