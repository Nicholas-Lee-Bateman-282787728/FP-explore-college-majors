This French family is living right smack off a dead road, their lives are strewn on the road, couch, wading pool, toys, etc.  Until, the road is opened to a highway and they choose to adapt to the highway noise.Marthe, the wife has previously been a drug addict and while vulnerable, does not want to move once the absurdity of living on the major highway becomes what some might say, unbearable.  The family consists of Marthe, her husband, three children, two teenage girls and a boy about 8 years.You do not see anything other than the highway and the home, giving the viewer first hand look at the closeness and confines of living on the highway.  But Marthe refuses to move,  her husband takes drastic measures to ward off the noise, one daughter is paranoid believing they will all die with the contamination and the other daughter drifts away too.  The madness slowly creeps up.There is 30 minute interview with Director Ursula Meier.  The idea of someone living on the highway was based on her knowledge of that situation.  The details are information, being the building of a highway from a road not in France, the noise level studied, the addition of 300 cars, etc.Now, here is America, we are not accustomed to viewing children in the nude, and moreso, children in the nude with their parents.  An 8-yr old boy in the bathtub with his mother?  A father and son in the bathroom while his teen daughter sits in the bathtub, in full view?

1347600,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B003JMGKPK,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[10, 11]","A family's isolated idyllic existence along the edge of an abandoned highway is interrupted when it is unexpectedly opened for traffic.  Ursula Meier, in a potent directorial debut, depicts from the outset and directly without any need for explanation the effortless and carefree life of a family whose relative isolation enables them to live as they will, to escape from the expectations and judgments of others and live simply.  We are gradually made aware that their stability as a family depends upon this separation from the outside world.  This is especially true of the mother, played fearlessly by Isabelle Huppert, whose ability to manage the home and to cope with her situation begins to break down as the world intrudes.  There are hints that this is not the first time, and that they had come to this place in hopes of achieving some kind of stability.The cinematography is rich, the performances uniformly strong, the story manages to work both as drama and as allegory.  I loved the soundtrack, and Nina Simone over the credits was a perfect ending.  I just finished seeing it the second time and it managed to both fascinate and frighten.  At some level this is, effectively, a highly restrained ecological horror film, where the monster is just the world encroaching in, in the form of increasing traffic and incessant noise and pollution, and that triggers desperation.  In many ways the film reminded me of a more subtle and smaller scale version of something likeThe Mosquito Coast, and it works with the same issues: the idea of the need to escape into a carefree wilderness, the idea that a man should somehow protect his family at all costs from the risks of the outside world.On the one hand, the drama that accompanies the gradual breakdown of their comfortable rituals is fascinating to watch.  Hints that the highway will be opening are met at first with disbelief, then curiosity and eventually despair.  On the other hand, as it develops there is a clear sense that something more is at stake here than the merely personal lives of this family.  There are hints of something more than just a realistic story of familial breakdown, and I couldn't help but think of Ballard'sConcrete Islandand of Bu&ntilde;uel'sThe Discreet Charm Of The Bourgeoisie, or even the much darker,Dogtooth.  After all the life they manage to lead is a kind of bourgeois fantasy - with a rugged male father figure who goes off into the unknown every day in order to bring back the supplies that will sustain his family, and of the beautiful wife who is keeper of the home, who greets each child as they come home from school with a ready-made snack, of the carefree innocence with which siblings bathe together nude - it is this fantasy they have managed to achieve apart, that inevitably won't last, but it's fascinating how far they are willing to go in an effort to maintain it.  The final shot, that depicts what is left of their efforts, from the perspective of an intrigued traveler on the highway, manages to say a great deal about general carelessness regarding the impact of the endless suburbanization of everyday life.

We learn they have lived like this for 10 years, and quite happily and care-free. The opening scene of the family playing street-hockey is a perfect introduction. Alas, disaster strikes when the news comes that the highway is being completed and opened. What initially is a trickle of cars becomes a wave of cars and trucks, and the family's entire existence as they knew it comes to an end. Isabelle Huppert's character does not want to move at any cost, and to battle the never-ending noice, the family shuts all windows and doors and layers the house with tons of sound-proofing material. This time, the resulting isolation is not so splendid.""Home"" is the original title of the movie, which is a bit curious since this is a French-speaking movie. That aside, this was Switzerland's official entry for the Foreign Movie Oscars for 2008 and it's easy to see why. This is a dark movie, for sure, but one that is definitely worth seeking out. Isabelle Huppert, 56 years old when this was filmed, looks as beautiful as ever, and her acting skills are tops. But the other family members are quite good as well, in particular the little boy.

Zwick,"[24, 27]","****1/2Have you ever found yourself wondering about those people who live right alongside the freeway - the anonymous folk whose lives we peer into for mere nano-seconds as we hurtle our way past their apartments and houses en route to our destinations?  Well, the artists who made ""Home"" certainly have, and the answer they've come up with makes for a fascinating, one-of-a-kind cinematic experience that, even more than most movies, has to be seen to be fully appreciated.The family in ""Home"" leads a relatively carefree and decidedly unconventional lifestyle.  Their house stands adjacent to an abandoned freeway, which they use as their own private recreation area.  They also view bath time as a communal experience (this being Switzerland and all).All is going reasonably well (despite some mild familial tension here and there), until one day and without any warning, the roadway is reopened to traffic, shattering the family's once-peaceful existence with the sounds of whooshing cars and honking horns, the penetrating odor of exhaust fumes and fossil fuels, a diminution of privacy (especially during traffic jams), and a nonstop assault on the senses.  Even getting to the other side of the road - to school or to work - becomes a daily, death-defying game of chicken with speeding vehicles whose drivers have no intention of slowing down for bothersome and unwelcome pedestrians.This tremendously odd little film is obviously intended as a parable about the oppressiveness and chaos of modern life as it encroaches ever more forcefully onto the peace and tranquility of a rural existence.  The family members become increasingly ill-tempered, paranoid, neurotic, even violent as the outside world inexorably presses its way into their once-placid lives.But far more than the characters and themes, it is the astonishing mise-en-scene that ultimately works its way into the viewer's psyche and that makes it hard not only to avert one's eyes during the course of the movie but to get back to one's own ""reality"" once it's over.  Director Ursula Meier's work here is reminiscent of Luis Bunuel in one of his less playful moods, as she focuses on a group of everyday people trapped in a surrealistic nightmare from which they are unable to awaken.  It is definitely a case in which the scene becomes an integral reflection of the psychological states of the characters.Isabelle Hupert and Olivier Gourmet play the parents; Madeleine Budd and Kacey Mottet Klein their two children; and Adelaide Leroux, Gourmet's nubile daughter from a previous marriage who spends most of her time sunbathing for the highly appreciative motorists and truckers who keep whizzing on by.Unique and unforgettable.",4,a unique and unforgettable visual experience,1285545600,"09 27, 2010",2010,2701,"['****1/2Have', 'ever', 'found', 'wondering', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'right', 'freeway', 'anonymous', 'folk', 'peer', 'mere', 'nano-seconds', 'hurtle', 'way', 'apartments', 'houses', 'en', 'route', 'destinations', 'Well', 'artists', 'who', 'made', 'Home', 'certainly', 'have', 'answer', ""'ve"", 'come', 'up', 'fascinating', 'one-of-a-kind', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'even', 'more', 'most', 'movies', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated.The', 'family', 'Home', 'relatively', 'carefree', 'decidedly', 'unconventional', 'lifestyle', 'house', 'adjacent', 'abandoned', 'freeway', 'use', 'own', 'private', 'recreation', 'area', 'also', 'view', 'bath', 'time', 'communal', 'experience', 'being', 'Switzerland', '.All', 'going', 'reasonably', 'well', 'mild', 'familial', 'tension', 'here', 'there', 'one', 'day', 'warning', 'roadway', 'reopened', 'traffic', 'shattering', 'family', 'once-peaceful', 'existence', 'sounds', 'whooshing', 'cars', 'honking', 'horns', 'penetrating', 'odor', 'exhaust', 'fumes', 'fossil', 'fuels', 'diminution', 'privacy', 'especially', 'traffic', 'jams', 'nonstop', 'assault', 'senses', 'Even', 'getting', 'other', 'side', 'road', 'school', 'work', 'daily', 'death-defying', 'game', 'chicken', 'speeding', 'vehicles', 'drivers', 'have', 'intention', 'slowing', 'down', 'bothersome', 'unwelcome', 'pedestrians.This', 'tremendously', 'odd', 'little', 'film', 'obviously', 'intended', 'parable', 'oppressiveness', 'chaos', 'modern', 'life', 'ever', 'more', 'forcefully', 'peace', 'tranquility', 'rural', 'existence', 'family', 'members', 'become', 'increasingly', 'ill-tempered', 'paranoid', 'neurotic', 'even', 'violent', 'outside', 'world', 'inexorably', 'way', 'once-placid', 'lives.But', 'far', 'more', 'characters', 'themes', 'astonishing', 'mise-en-scene', 'ultimately', 'way', 'viewer', 'psyche', 'hard', 'not', 'only', 'avert', 'one', 'eyes', 'course', 'movie', 'get', 'back', 'one', 'own', 'reality', 'over', 'Director', 'Ursula', 'Meier', 'work', 'here', 'reminiscent', 'Luis', 'Bunuel', 'one', 'less', 'playful', 'moods', 'group', 'everyday', 'people', 'trapped', 'surrealistic', 'nightmare', 'are', 'unable', 'awaken', 'definitely', 'case', 'scene', 'integral', 'reflection', 'psychological', 'states', 'characters.Isabelle', 'Hupert', 'Olivier', 'Gourmet', 'play', 'parents', 'Madeleine', 'Budd', 'Kacey', 'Mottet', 'Klein', 'two', 'children', 'Adelaide', 'Leroux', 'Gourmet', 'nubile', 'daughter', 'previous', 'marriage', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'sunbathing', 'highly', 'appreciative', 'motorists', 'truckers', 'who', 'keep', 'whizzing', 'by.Unique', 'unforgettable']",N/A

This is the story of a family who live next to a soon-to-be-finished highway,almost very close to the guard-rail,sunbathing don&#8217;t you know,and hanging their washing out in front of it.They never explore their hinterland perpendicularly,they&#8217;re obsessed with crossing the rails,playing on the macadam,or strolling merrily along it or the son Julien cycles frenetically up and down it.Are the family owners or squatters,it&#8217;s never clear,only that the mother(Huppert)doesn&#8217;t want to move again,and prior to the road opening,likes the bucolic charm of the open countryside.The family are reasonably eccentric, disinhibited physically(daughters go barebreasted in front of their father and their brother),Huppert is the dippy matron of this small circus.This is like a cartoon,the comedy is in the fact that the tenants observe the motorway, rather than become observed by the passing traffic.They also seem obsessed about getting across the motorway,when it&#8217;s full of traffic.The family make a lot of communal bathing, smoking cigarettes indoors,a radio,which is on all day and have a car that they use to get out of the place,to purchase all their necessary foodstuffs, the father to go to work,the children to go to school.One wonders why the house was not compulsorily purchased, when the motorway was in the process of being built.The family live a reasonably settled existence-minus the odd teenage rebellion-prior to the motorway opening.Dad(Olivier Gourmet) is brotherly to his children and loving to his wife, all tuned in to the same wavelength of humour.Then all hell breaks loose.the shattering of this tranquil space by whooshing cars, honking horns,car fumes,exhaust pollutants, despoiling their vegetable patch, their washing and their skin with the stain of fossil fuels.Even crossing the road becomes a death-defying game of chicken,with the traffic making no effort to slow down.You realise that the mise-en-scene is a state of mind defying the remorseless odds of modern existence.The family become increasingly neurotic,cranky,stubborn,perverse,ill-tempered, paranoid and violent.We go from a movie by Hulot to one by Haneke. Huppert holds them hostage to this existence,as she refuses to even contemplate moving,so they batten down the hatches,but the elder precocious daughter leaves, the noise and loss of privacy leads the father to walling up windows and doors,placing insulation material against the walls,their sleep and health affected by airless heat.This part of the movie is very dark as the father(Gourmet) wants them to leave and the children live in fear as they are driven to huddle up to their mother,he has attempted to put them all to sleep with sleeping pills.We get to a stage of deep anxiety,where this family seem unable to cope.Huppert as ever seem to contain the pain and the elegance together,Gourmet is great support,the son Julien puts in a superbly energetic and affecting performance,and the cat is ubiquitously entertaining.
