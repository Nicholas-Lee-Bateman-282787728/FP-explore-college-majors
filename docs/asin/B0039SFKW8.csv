Recorded at the House Of Blues in Boston's Fenway area, this dvd / cd doesn't ever get boring.  It's entertaining enough to watch repeatedly.  The audio and video quality is excellent.  I'd recommend this dvd to the casual Extreme fan as well.",5,This is the best live perfomance dvd of Extreme I've come across so far!,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,280,"['must', 'have', 'fan', 'Extreme', 'Recorded', 'House', 'Blues', 'Boston', 'Fenway', 'area', 'dvd', '/', 'cd', ""n't"", 'ever', 'get', 'boring', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'audio', 'video', 'quality', 'excellent', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'dvd', 'casual', 'Extreme', 'fan', 'as', 'well']",N/A
1333982,ALXY6VD5IUSTK,B0039SFKW8,Eric Larson,"[29, 30]","Extreme is back with their first live DVD/CD and it was worth the wait. This band sounds as good and preforms as well as they ever have. Gary Cherone (the most under-rated front man of all time IMO) sounds great and hits all the notes. Nuno Bettencourt is still ""the Man"" on lead guitar. Pat Badger's bass and backing vocals are flawless and new drummer on the block, Kevin Figueiredo, is the perfect fit for this band. This show was recorded at the House of Blues August 8th 2009 in Extreme's hometown of Boston, MA. and if I had to sum up the concert in one word it would be ""FUN""! This band is just so much ""fun"" to watch and listen to. This DVD really does a great job of capturing the energy of that show. I can say this because I was lucky enough to be there that night. Watching this DVD reminded me exactly what a great show it was and what it felt like to be there. Of course no dvd can be as great as being at the actual show but this dics does a fine job of showing off the talents of the band and what a great show thay put on. Now my being there that night and my love for this band might make me a tad bias. But this really is a great LIVE DVD. In fact I have some friends that are now getting into Extreme because I showed them this DVD. This group gets a lot of flack for being the ""More Than Words"" band but fans of these guys know how great they really are. And as live shows go, I would put these guys up against anybody.The show consists of the following songs from their five albums1. Decadence Dance2. Comfortably Numb3. Rest In Peace4. It's a (Monster)5. Star6. Tell Me Something I Don't Know7. Medley: Kid Ego, Little Girls8. Teacher's Pet9. Play With Me10. Midnight Express11. More Than Words12. Ghost13. Cupid's Dead14. Take Us Alive15. Flight of the Wounded Bumblebee16. Get the Funk Out17. Am I Ever Gonna Change?18. Hole HeartedAlso included are the following videosKing of the LadiesInterfaceRunGhostAnyways, for Extreme fans this DVD is a MUST!!!! And if you are someone who just wants to watch a great Rock band put on an Excellent show, then you could not do much better then this DVD. In fact the only thing better is to get out there youself and see Extreme actually play live.",5,A Great DVD by a Great Band,1272931200,"05 4, 2010",2010,2212,"['Extreme', 'back', 'first', 'live', 'DVD/CD', 'was', 'worth', 'wait', 'band', 'as', 'good', 'preforms', 'as', 'well', 'ever', 'have', 'Gary', 'Cherone', 'most', 'under-rated', 'front', 'man', 'time', 'IMO', 'great', 'notes', 'Nuno', 'Bettencourt', 'still', 'Man', 'lead', 'guitar', 'Pat', 'Badger', 'bass', 'backing', 'vocals', 'are', 'flawless', 'new', 'drummer', 'block', 'Kevin', 'Figueiredo', 'perfect', 'fit', 'band', 'show', 'was', 'recorded', 'House', 'Blues', 'August', '8th', '2009', 'Extreme', 'hometown', 'Boston', 'MA', 'had', 'sum', 'up', 'concert', 'one', 'word', 'would', 'be', 'FUN', 'band', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'listen', 'DVD', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'energy', 'show', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'be', 'there', 'night', 'Watching', 'DVD', 'reminded', 'exactly', 'what', 'great', 'show', 'was', 'what', 'felt', 'be', 'there', 'course', 'dvd', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'great', 'being', 'actual', 'show', 'dics', 'fine', 'job', 'showing', 'off', 'talents', 'band', 'what', 'great', 'show', 'thay', 'put', 'Now', 'being', 'night', 'love', 'band', 'might', 'make', 'tad', 'bias', 'really', 'great', 'LIVE', 'DVD', 'fact', 'have', 'friends', 'are', 'now', 'getting', 'Extreme', 'showed', 'DVD', 'group', 'lot', 'flack', 'being', 'More', 'Than', 'Words', 'band', 'fans', 'guys', 'know', 'how', 'great', 'really', 'are', 'live', 'shows', 'go', 'would', 'put', 'guys', 'up', 'anybody.The', 'show', 'following', 'songs', 'five', 'albums1', 'Decadence', 'Dance2', 'Comfortably', 'Numb3', 'Rest', 'Peace4', 'Monster', '5', 'Star6', 'Tell', 'Me', 'Something', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know7', 'Medley', 'Kid', 'Ego', 'Little', 'Girls8', 'Teacher', 'Pet9', 'Play', 'Me10', 'Midnight', 'Express11', 'More', 'Than', 'Words12', 'Ghost13', 'Cupid', 'Dead14', 'Take', 'Us', 'Alive15', 'Flight', 'Wounded', 'Bumblebee16', 'Get', 'Funk', 'Out17', 'Am', 'Ever', 'Gon', 'Change', '18', 'Hole', 'HeartedAlso', 'included', 'are', 'following', 'videosKing', 'LadiesInterfaceRunGhostAnyways', 'Extreme', 'fans', 'DVD', 'MUST', 'are', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'watch', 'great', 'Rock', 'band', 'put', 'Excellent', 'show', 'then', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'then', 'DVD', 'fact', 'only', 'thing', 'better', 'get', 'out', 'there', 'see', 'Extreme', 'actually', 'play', 'live']",N/A

The band is tight, and Nuno and Pat's harmonies are still amazing. I saw this tour and loved it! I had taken a friend who only knew More Than Words and they were blown away. The guys had brought up Sheila E towards the end of the show and did an incredible funky metal version of Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' as a tribute to MJ, who had just recently passed away. That would've been excellent material for bonus footage on this release, but sadly it is not included here. But that's okay. The guys are all completely relaxed and it looks as though they're having the time of their lives. The songs span their entire catalogue, and there's not  bad song in the bunch. Nuno Bettencourt is still one of the most amazing guitarists ever. A couple of videos are included as well.

1333986,AF65C8QK9NNXP,B0039SFKW8,Michael,"[1, 1]","Extreme are an awesome band that has strong songwriting and performance skill and they have a secret weapon - Nuno Bettencourt. The man is a god amongst men. As Garry Cherone says in the DVD ""There can be only one"". Nuno plays the guitar better than almost anyone on the planet and he writes all the songs and he sings as good as any lead singer and he plays piano like a pro. He is the ultimate musician. Check out his unmatched rythm guitar playing and the mind-blowing solos in each song. His intense acoustic playing is on display too in songs like the blistering and  technical ""Midnight Express"" and their hit ballad ""More Than Words"" - check out the tapping at the end! The band is tight and their passion for the performance is excellent. Garry Cherone is still a great frontman after all these years, Pat Badger is a legend for matching Nuno on the bass and check out his excellent backing vocals, and Kevin is grooving on the drums. Highly recommended to fans of the band and those wanting to see a true guitar hero.",5,Two words...Nuno Bettencourt!,1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,1026,"['Extreme', 'are', 'awesome', 'band', 'strong', 'songwriting', 'performance', 'skill', 'have', 'secret', 'weapon', 'Nuno', 'Bettencourt', 'man', 'god', 'amongst', 'men', 'Garry', 'Cherone', 'DVD', 'can', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'Nuno', 'guitar', 'better', 'almost', 'anyone', 'planet', 'songs', 'as', 'good', 'lead', 'singer', 'piano', 'pro', 'ultimate', 'musician', 'Check', 'out', 'unmatched', 'rythm', 'guitar', 'playing', 'mind-blowing', 'solos', 'song', 'intense', 'acoustic', 'playing', 'display', 'too', 'songs', 'blistering', 'technical', 'Midnight', 'Express', 'hit', 'More', 'Than', 'Words', 'check', 'out', 'tapping', 'end', 'band', 'tight', 'passion', 'performance', 'excellent', 'Garry', 'Cherone', 'still', 'great', 'frontman', 'years', 'Pat', 'Badger', 'legend', 'matching', 'Nuno', 'bass', 'check', 'out', 'excellent', 'backing', 'vocals', 'Kevin', 'grooving', 'drums', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'band', 'wanting', 'see', 'true', 'guitar', 'hero']",N/A
