Forget that this has a rep as a &quot;family film&quot;. It is that. It is a wonderful film for children. But, it is also a film that can be fully appreciated by adults. It is simply beautiful and timeless. The Technicolor cinematography is simply stunning. The direction &amp; performances first class.The story of a backwoods couple in post Civil-War Florida, their only (surviving) child and his love for a Yearling fawn, and their friends &amp; neighbors, is told simply with wit &amp; humor, with compassion and sensitivity, and with subtlety to the undercurrents of emotion and feeling. A story of fun and sorrow, of the struggle for existence, of tragic necessity and loss and the redemptive power of love. Real life lessons served with some humility, sensitivity, and compassion, in a real setting, with natural and low-key performances punctuating the morals of the story nicely. And, YES, dammit, it'll choke you up.Far superior to most of the tripe that passes for family films, this one holds up. Gregory Peck is funny &amp; relaxed and wonderfully caring as the father, a performance in some ways more natural and deeper than his Oscar winning turn in To Kill a Mockingbird. Jane Wyman graduated to the big leagues of serious acting with her performance as the mother, wounded and fearing to love because of her previous losses of infants &amp; toddlers. And Claude Jarmon is open-faced, honest and effective as Jody, a role that earned him a special Oscar.The final speech about the joy &amp; tragedy of life Peck gives to his son Jody was plagiarized and lifted almost word-for-word for the final similar speech in Disney's Old Yeller, a beloved film that today looks cheap and quickly and poorly made with terrible acting. Old Yeller might still work for little kids, but I can't imagine an adult sitting through it. The Yearling, in contrast, was made with an adult sensibility and it will remain richly rewarding for anyone.I can't imagine anyone who feels human emotions and has had the pure joy of childhood freedom &amp; adventure, and also faced awful decisions and tragic losses as child and adult not enjoying this film. As for the rest, well, nuff said.

Each time I watch it I find something new to enjoy about the dialogue, subtle humor and deep sadness evoked when Jody stops being &quot;a yearling&quot; and leaves his childhood behind.  The scenes between  Jody and his pet deer, Flag,  are touching in their innocence and the sheer  joy you share when seeing them run and jump and play.  Gregory Peck is  wonderful (as usual) as the understanding father - dealing with his desire  to let his son enjoy childhood a bit longer and to shield him from some of  life's more bitter lessons.  Jane Wyman as the stoic mother, Ory -  brilliantly portrays a woman who has locked her heart away after the death  of 3 of her children, and finds it difficult to let herself freely love her  surviving son, Jody.  When Ory finally realizes she can open her heart to  her son even though life makes no guarrantee against pain, it is a moment  that any mother can relate to.  I recommend this movie to adults and  teenagers, but I feel that the scene where the yearling deer must be  destroyed is too heart-rending for smaller children.

427936,A30TK6U7DNS82R,6304546327,Kevin Killian,"[13, 13]","THE YEARLING, so beautifully shot and scored, is one of the very best postwar US films.  It will have you welling up in tears, and the acting is awfully good.  Some say that Claude Jarman, Jr didn't deserve that honorary Kid's Oscar he got for playing little Jody, but I think his performance was outstanding.  When he's romping around with Flag, the young deer, you wonder how director Clarence Brown got him to be so natural in this, his first movie.  I also liked him with Lassie and Jeanette MacDonald in THE SUN COMES UP and he was very believable as the young trouper torn between admiration for his dad (John Wayne) and devotion to his flamboyant mother (Maureen O'Hara).  Jarman was one of the few child actors with the talent to make it into acting in adult parts, and yet for some reason he did not go on, and we will continue to remember himad Jody Baxter.  In THE YEARLING his parents are in a similar situation to his parents in RIO GRANDE.  Here they are not divorced or estranged, but the mother (Jane Wyman) seems locked in the past, unable to deal with the grief of multiple miscarriages and infant births, while Penny (Greg Peck) has to go on being both Mom and Dad to young Jody.  That he does so without resentment is part of the reason that, for many of us, watching THE YEARLING is a lesson in growing up, from making the passage between boyhood and manhood.  Peck is endearing, and I don't think that even Spencer Tracy, who originated the part in an earlier, scrapped MGM version of the novel, could have bettered the performance Peck offers up here.

In fact, I was so turned off, I turned IT off. Now, I realize that not having seen the movie to its end makes my opinon less important than other folks', but I'll take that chance.There are three main characters, the father, the mother, and the son. Let's start with the son. I didn't like his looks--something about him really irritated me. Perhaps it was his listless hair, perhaps it was the feeling that he had a perpetual runny nose, I dunno, something like that. Then there's the father, played by Gregory Peck. Personally, I think Peck had to mature into being a better actor. I believe he was given a lot of roles in his early movie career for which he lacked the depth to portray convincingly. Here, he's supposed to be an ex-Confederate who's trying to eke out a life on his Florida farm who has had to bury his older children. Peck is not at all convincing in this role; even his feigned Southern accent is poor. The only life experience I'm convinced he has had is having grown tall. I think Henry Fonda or Robert Mitchum would have been able to bring much more to this role. Now, Jane Wyman as the mother is a different story. I truly believe her as this embittered woman who has lost so many children that she cannot bear to risk her heart again on the last remaining boy. If the other two actors had been different, I would have stayed with the movie to find out what was going to happen to Wyman's character.Maybe one day, when I have seen everything else that I ever wanted to see, I will steel myself to sit through &quot;The Yearling&quot; in its entirety, but not before then.",1,The Dissenting Vote,999388800,"09 2, 2001",2001,1706,"['Sorry', 'be', 'tune', 'other', 'reviewers', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'quot', 'Yearling', 'quot', 'AT', 'ALL', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'turned', 'off', 'turned', 'IT', 'Now', 'realize', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'movie', 'end', 'opinon', 'less', 'important', 'other', 'folks', ""'ll"", 'take', 'are', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'father', 'mother', 'son', 'Let', 'start', 'son', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'looks', 'something', 'really', 'irritated', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'listless', 'hair', 'perhaps', 'was', 'feeling', 'had', 'perpetual', 'runny', 'nose', 'dunno', 'something', 'Then', 'father', 'played', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Personally', 'think', 'Peck', 'had', 'mature', 'being', 'better', 'actor', 'believe', 'was', 'given', 'lot', 'roles', 'early', 'movie', 'career', 'lacked', 'depth', 'portray', 'convincingly', 'Here', 'supposed', 'be', 'ex-Confederate', 'who', 'trying', 'eke', 'out', 'life', 'Florida', 'farm', 'who', 'had', 'bury', 'older', 'children', 'Peck', 'not', 'convincing', 'role', 'even', 'feigned', 'Southern', 'accent', 'poor', 'only', 'life', 'experience', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'had', 'having', 'grown', 'tall', 'think', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'bring', 'much', 'more', 'role', 'Now', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'mother', 'different', 'story', 'truly', 'believe', 'embittered', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'so', 'many', 'children', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'risk', 'heart', 'again', 'last', 'remaining', 'boy', 'other', 'two', 'actors', 'had', 'been', 'different', 'would', 'have', 'stayed', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'Wyman', 'character.Maybe', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'have', 'seen', 'everything', 'else', 'ever', 'wanted', 'see', 'will', 'steel', 'sit', 'quot', 'Yearling', 'quot', 'entirety', 'not', 'then']",N/A

While Jody Baxter, a lonely 12-year-old, is the central protagonist, the film delves into mature themes such as man's struggle against nature for survival, what constitutes our measurement of wealth, how our experiences shape the way we perceive and approach life, and how events can precipitate the transition from adolescence to adulthood. The book received the Pulitzer Prize in 1939, and the film was nominated for academy awards in the categories best film, best actor, best actress, best director, and best film editing. Gregory Peck, Jane Wyman and Claude Jarman star in the lead roles, with some of Hollywood's best character actors playing colorful supporting roles.The Yearling takes place in northeast Florida during the late 1870s. Jody's father, the shrewd but softhearted Penny Baxter (Peck), is a former rebel soldier trying to eke out a living for his family on a small farm. His somber wife, Orry (Wyman), has been so emotionally depleted by the deaths of several children that she cannot show love for Jody, her remaining child, for fear of losing him too. Jody, a wistful daydreamer, would rather explore the surrounding scrublands than attend to his chores, and his father, well aware of his son's loneliness, tends to forgive and indulge him, leaving Orry the role of disciplinarian and harsh realist.The relationship between Penny and Jody is a wonderful example of a father passing on moral and ethical values, as well as the practical skills needed to survive in life. Penny shows Jody how to earn the respect of their fierce neighbors, the Forresters, how to plant crops and to hunt. In fact, it is during a bear hunt that Penny is bitten by a rattler and must shoot a doe to save his life. Not long after, Jody discovers and adopts -- against his parents' advice -- the doe's orphaned fawn, which he names Flag. His subsequent attempts to domesticate Flag and his relationship with a crippled Forrester boy, Fodderwing, lead him to the defining moments that mark his coming of age.If you enjoy movies of past decades and stories of family life and character development, I highly recommend this film.

Know what you're getting into.Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' The Yearling is one of my favorite books. My mother read it to my sister and me when we were children and later on I read it again as a teenager. There's something I find so moving, powerful and endearing about the story. Rawlings' style is so lyrical, poetic and descriptive. She did an outstanding job making me care for the three main characters and literally drew me into their world. What is so special about it is the struggles each character had and how he or she strove to overcome them. How Penny knew letting his son have a pet deer was a mistake from the start but couldn't help it because he wanted him to have the childhood he was denied. How Ora is rough, tough and cantankerous (what woman wouldn't be after three stillbirths?) on the outside but lets her inner soft streak show every now and then. How Jody realizes what makes you a man is when you do what you know in your heart is right--sacrificing for the greater good--even when it's extremely difficult.Every scene is beautifully done and uses dialogue straight out of the book. The cinematography is knockout magnificent and deserved its Oscar one hundred percent. My favorite parts are when Jody and his pet are roaming the forest with a group of deer following close behind and after the flood when the family is outside staring at their ruined crop and BOOM! We get a long spectacular shot of the sun coming out of the clouds.Herbert Stothart's rich orchestration and sweeping melodies based on Fredrick Delius' Florida Suite are magnificent and those choral sections especially in the dream sequence at the end are beyond amazing.Gregory Peck is way too tall and handsome to play Penny but he's got the laid back, giant-hearted, model father persona nailed to a T. Peck is an actor I'm not too crazy about (I usually feel like his demeanor is too stiff and he `holds it in' too much) but here he completely melted into the character. My favorite of his scenes are:1. When he's sick in bed and Jody tells him about the fawn out there in the woods all alone and helpless. Peck has a twinkle in his eye and sly smile--he KNOWS exactly where this is headed.2. The tight frown on his face when his wife is using him as a manican for making a dress--especially when Jody walks in on them. You can see he is not thrilled in the least.3. The climatic final discussion when Jody comes back home.I'm usually not too crazy about child actors but I'd never know that Claude Jarman Jr. (Jody) was an amateur if I didn't read up about the making of this movie. His emotions (like when his face lights up on finding the deer and rage when his mother shoots it) are so real and he acts like he's been acting all his life. That look on his face when he tries to muster up the courage to shoot Flag--not when he pulls the trigger, just THOSE FEW SECONDS BEFORE--is absolutely unforgettable.Jarman and Peck get two of my March Boy Leading Actor nominations and the only reason they don't win is because I split the vote for James Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life.Best of all is Jane Wyman as Ora who IMHO packed the biggest emotional punch at the end. She plays worry, care, joy and sorrow in a manner that is very real and even though she's usually grouchy and no-nonsense, you can tell that deep down inside she deeply loves her son and husband but is afraid to show it. I was touched beyond words at her acting and often wept at her performance and I usually never cry at movies. When it got to the end where she sees Jody has come home, she finally drops the rough and tough act and lets it all out ""Oh Ezra I thought I had lost them all."" And then hugs and kisses him goodnight--GOOD GRIEF that made me cry SSSSSOOO hard.I highly recommend this movie. I think it the Jody/Penny/Ora triangle is one of the most powerful and complex portraits of a parent/child relationship ever written and I challenge anyone who sees this movie or reads the book to try to gain a deeper understanding of the struggles of growing up and the joys and sorrows of parenting.Five Stars.",5,"""What does a man do when life knocks him about?

Gregory Peck was very handsome and young in this movie.  The young boy who used a cane to walk was a special role on his part.  I cried when he died.  When the snake bit Peck's arm, I jumped and thought he was going to die in this scene, but I'm glad he survived and in the way he had to shoot the deer to get a liver to draw the poison out. The church, people, way of life with the stores and Jane Wyman making her own dress, using Peck as dummy form was funny.  The weather and the young deer, growing up in a house, in the boy's bed and how beautiful the scenery was, is breathtaking.  Well worth watching!!

The film stars Gregory Peck, Jane Wyman and Claude Jarman in the lead  roles, with some of Hollywood's best character actors in the colorful  supporting roles.Peck gives an Oscar caliber performance as the  warmhearted father who tries his best to make a better life for his family,  with absolutely no help from the elements, which surround them. Jane Wyman  plays his wife Orry, the hardened mother and wife who is so embittered by  past tragedies in her life that she refuses to show any love for her one  remaining child for fear of losing him too. And Claude Jarman plays Jodie  the wistful young son who is just one summer away from adolescence and all  the hardships that come with growing up.This story is chock-full of  excitement and adventure sure to please the kids, and each of those  adventures is also a great lesson on life that will stay with them for  years to come. Just watching Jodie romp with his pet faun for that one  fleeting summer is a joyous site to behold and the touching scenes where  Orry finally begins letting herself love her son will bring tears to your  eyes. And of course the heart-rending scenes of Jodie trying his best to  get the yearling to run away so he won't have destroy it, all come together  to make  this movie one of the most emotional experiences of my childhood  and I must say I believe I'm a better person for the values I learned from  this timeless story.Experience this film with your children, you won't  be sorry you did.",5,A Timeless Classic That Must Be Seen,958521600,"05 17, 2000",2000,1939,"['wonderful', 'film', 'one', 'handful', 'power', 'call', 'back', 'childhood', 'days', 'wrap', 'warm', 'memories', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'little', 'brother', 'sitting', 'television', 'Saturday', 'night', 'watching', 'late', 'show.From', 'opening', 'scenes', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'movie', 'found', 'caught-up', 'intriguing', 'post', 'Civil', 'War', 'story', 'boy', 'pet', 'faun', 'fantastic', 'adventures', 'scruffy', 'Florida', 'Everglades', 'farm', 'film', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'Claude', 'Jarman', 'lead', 'roles', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'character', 'actors', 'colorful', 'supporting', 'roles.Peck', 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'performance', 'warmhearted', 'father', 'who', 'best', 'make', 'better', 'life', 'family', 'absolutely', 'help', 'elements', 'surround', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'wife', 'Orry', 'hardened', 'mother', 'wife', 'who', 'so', 'embittered', 'past', 'tragedies', 'life', 'show', 'love', 'one', 'remaining', 'child', 'fear', 'losing', 'too', 'Claude', 'Jarman', 'Jodie', 'wistful', 'young', 'son', 'who', 'just', 'one', 'summer', 'away', 'adolescence', 'hardships', 'come', 'growing', 'up.This', 'story', 'chock-full', 'excitement', 'adventure', 'sure', 'please', 'kids', 'adventures', 'also', 'great', 'lesson', 'life', 'will', 'stay', 'years', 'come', 'Just', 'watching', 'Jodie', 'romp', 'pet', 'faun', 'one', 'fleeting', 'summer', 'joyous', 'site', 'behold', 'touching', 'scenes', 'where', 'Orry', 'finally', 'letting', 'love', 'son', 'will', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'course', 'heart-rending', 'scenes', 'Jodie', 'trying', 'best', 'get', 'yearling', 'run', 'away', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'destroy', 'come', 'together', 'make', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'emotional', 'experiences', 'childhood', 'must', 'say', 'believe', ""'m"", 'better', 'person', 'values', 'learned', 'timeless', 'story.Experience', 'film', 'children', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry', 'did']",N/A

I'm certainly glad that I gave it a chance.At first I watched because the scenery was pretty but it didn't take long for me to get completely involved in the story.  Gregory Peck plays the nicest man in the world (!) and he sure looks good, too.  Over and over we are charmed and awed by his strength and goodness as he copes with a cold blooded wife and their sensitive young son.  Jane Wyman is excellent as the wife who has closed her heart to all hope of happiness and joy after having lost three children.  Claude Jarmen Jr. is amazing as Jody, the son and certainly deserved his special Oscar.There is so much wisdom in the story as the family meets life raw and unprotected by the comforts we all enjoy.  The boy, especially, must deal with the death of his only friend, (who is beautifully played by another superb child actor), the coldness of his mother, and by his deep love for his fawn, Flag.

427950,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6304546327,Randy Keehn,"[7, 7]","I had been under the opinion that I had seen this movie some years ago.  After watching it last night, I realized that either I was mistaken or I wasn't paying attention at the time because this is a movie that will always stay vivid in my heart and mind.  This is one of the most heart-rendering movies that I have ever seen and it is assembled in every way to help bring out the emotion of its' message.  The message is one of life's difficult lesson's: growing up eventually means discovering that not everything has a happy ending.  It is an important movie for families to share yet some may feel that the impact of the message is too strong for younger children.  That may well be true.  I would suggest that it is an appropriate movie for those who are at least in the 11-13 year old age group portrayed by the child  in ""The Yearling"".This is the story of a subsistance farm family in remote rural Florida in the early to mid 1800's.  The opening scenes show us a virtual Garden of Eden but we soon come to realize that life on the land was not necessarily paradise.  We quickly become acquainted with the father, mother, and the 11-year old son, Jody.  We discover a somber and stern mother and realize why as she visits the graves of her three other children who died at early ages in this beautiful but challenging land.  We actually spend a bit too much time before we get to the heart and soul of the movie.  We meet a few too many characters and work our way through a few too many incidents.  The movie would have been just as impressive if the first half of it were 15-20 minutes shorter.We are already pretty involved with this family when Jody gets his wish to take an orphan fawn as his own pet.  The joy they have together is shown in a series of heart-warming snippets.  Troubles starts to brew and the scenes of frollick turn into those of stress and strain.  I won't let on how this movie ends but it is a real emotional roller coaster that will start to choke even the toughest heart.  In the end, important lessons are learned by all and we are reminded how tough it is to grow up.The acting in this movie is superb although the characters seem to go a bit too far with the backwoods slang.  Somehow ""Ma, the boy done come home!"" takes a bit away from the emotion of the moment.  It's theatrically possible to talk the talk and give the proper flavor without going as far as they did in ""The Yearling"".  That aside, Gregory Peck and Jane Wyman give excellent performances as the father and mother.  You'll be surprized to see a young and slim Chill Wills and I didn't even realize that it was Forest Tucker in one of the roles until I was watching the cast and credits at the end.  However, the outstanding performance of the movie was that of Claude Jarman Jr. as Jody.  This kid (and his pet deer) stole the show and bent our emotions in the process.""The Yearling"" is a sort of ""Old Yeller"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" rolled up into one.

Johnson,"[61, 64]","This movie really could not be improved upon; every single performance, from Calude Jarman Jr to Gregory Peck, Jane Wyman and Chill Wills are astonishingly believable; you never think you are watching a movie, this is truly a window into a real world. The boy who plays Fodderwing is extraordinary, almost unearthly, in his role. The dream sequences with the deer are breathtaking, as are all the scenes which have animals interacting with people. You really get involved in this one; it is not merely a spectator event; you are THERE, with Jody and his parents, and Flag, his little deer. I have seen this too many times to count, starting when I was about 6 years old, and have never lost one iota of awe when I see it again. It is a shame that movies with this kind of heart, emnotion and inner strength/courage are not made anymore; there are simply no stories now to equal this one, and that is a pity. Still, you can go home again when you see this movie; it never loses its appeal, even through repeated viewings, and you are always immediately caught up in the story and the characters. Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings grew up in the Florida Everglades, and waa a master at describing the unique flora and fauna which proliferate there; it is a very unusual place, and this story takes you right to the center. A must for every DVD/VHS library, and a family classic for years to come.",5,"Incredible story, wonderful performances",1060300800,"08 8, 2003",2003,1385,"['movie', 'really', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'improved', 'single', 'performance', 'Calude', 'Jarman', 'Jr', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'Chill', 'Wills', 'are', 'astonishingly', 'believable', 'never', 'think', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'truly', 'window', 'real', 'world', 'boy', 'who', 'Fodderwing', 'extraordinary', 'almost', 'unearthly', 'role', 'dream', 'deer', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'are', 'scenes', 'have', 'animals', 'interacting', 'people', 'really', 'get', 'involved', 'one', 'not', 'merely', 'spectator', 'event', 'are', 'THERE', 'Jody', 'parents', 'Flag', 'little', 'deer', 'have', 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'count', 'starting', 'when', 'was', '6', 'years', 'old', 'have', 'never', 'lost', 'one', 'iota', 'awe', 'when', 'see', 'again', 'shame', 'movies', 'kind', 'heart', 'emnotion', 'inner', 'strength/courage', 'are', 'not', 'made', 'anymore', 'are', 'simply', 'stories', 'now', 'equal', 'one', 'pity', 'Still', 'can', 'go', 'home', 'again', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'never', 'appeal', 'even', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'are', 'always', 'immediately', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'characters', 'Marjorie', 'Kinnan', 'Rawlings', 'grew', 'up', 'Florida', 'Everglades', 'waa', 'master', 'describing', 'unique', 'flora', 'fauna', 'proliferate', 'very', 'unusual', 'place', 'story', 'right', 'center', 'must', 'DVD/VHS', 'library', 'family', 'classic', 'years', 'come']",N/A

Of all of director Clarence Brown's films, including &quot;National Velvet&quot;, &quot;The Yearling&quot; has the most chock-full of enjoyable and memorable scenes. Even though the story is centered around Jody (Jarman, Jr.) and his pet fawn Flag, for me it's more about Jody and his father Penny Baxter (Peck). Their relationship is the best father-son relationship I've seen in a film. Gregory Peck can play fathers in movies better than most actors because his characters always listen to their children. Claude Jarman, Jr. received a special Academy Award for this film, and deserved it. During the last half of this movie, I was so amazed by how well he could cry. His performance ranks among the very best performances from child actors in movies. The ending both breaks my heart and fills me with hope, when the father tells Jody about life and when the mother (Wyman) finally opens up her love to Jody.

From its opening scene it draws you into the life of a family struggling for its existence against the forces of nature.But it is the actors that make  this film memorable, especially the two boys who are growing into maturity.  Gregory Peck and Jane Wyman portray parents who have had misfortunes and  love their son deeply.  The father-son relationship between Peck and Jarman  is particularly touching.The relationship between Fodderwing (sp?) and  Jarman is remarkable in its realistic portrayal of their close association.  These two young actors deserve applause for their excellent job!The  main events which spur the spiritual growth of Jarman are associated with  his taking of a fawn for a pet.  The scene in which Fodderwing's name for  the pet is given to Jarman is one of the most touching I have seen on the  screen.This is a movie I will always treasure.",5,"In my opinion, one of the ten best movies ever made!",921456000,"03 15, 1999",1999,936,"['have', 'often', 'thought', 'movie', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'filmed', 'opening', 'scene', 'life', 'family', 'struggling', 'existence', 'forces', 'nature.But', 'actors', 'make', 'film', 'memorable', 'especially', 'two', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'growing', 'maturity', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'portray', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'misfortunes', 'love', 'son', 'deeply', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'Peck', 'Jarman', 'particularly', 'touching.The', 'relationship', 'Fodderwing', 'sp', 'Jarman', 'remarkable', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'close', 'association', 'two', 'young', 'actors', 'deserve', 'applause', 'excellent', 'job', 'main', 'events', 'spur', 'spiritual', 'growth', 'Jarman', 'are', 'associated', 'taking', 'fawn', 'pet', 'scene', 'Fodderwing', 'name', 'pet', 'given', 'Jarman', 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'have', 'seen', 'screen.This', 'movie', 'will', 'always', 'treasure']",N/A
