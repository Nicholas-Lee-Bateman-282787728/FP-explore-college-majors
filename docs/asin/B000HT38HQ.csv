1015972,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B000HT38HQ,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[17, 18]","What a wonderful little three pack/ box set of Chuck Norris films.  The only other box set of Chuck Norris' films that I know of is the one with The Delta Force and Missing in Action sagas.  This set is really awesome if you are a fan of Chuck Norris.  With respect of my reviews title, I will address each film.Frights: Hellbound.This movie is really sort of out there, even for Chuck Norris' standards.  Chuck plays a Chicago cop who, along with his partner, ends up going against the Devil or some sort of Satanic being after some dubious loose ends in a murder case transpire in the Windy City.  In this movie is Sheree J. Wilson, who was also in Walker, Texas Ranger.  This movie is a bit ""tongue-in-cheek"" and over the top, but very entertaining nevertheless.Fights: The Hitman.This is your classic revenge movie.  I have seen many of Chuck Norris' films and I would have to say this is one of his darkest, even more so than Hellbound.  Chuck plays a cop that is undercover, deep undercover, and so deep he could be Darth Maul with a beard.  He is dressed all in black, doesn't pull any punches literally and philosophically speaking.  The Hitman is a very violent film that really has a film noir type of vibe to it.  This is essential Norris viewing.Neon Lights: Forced Vengeance.This is an older film by Mr. Norris, so old that the trademark beard isn't present, only a mustache.  Now please don't let that make you avoid this movie, because it is really good.  Chuck plays a bouncer at a casino in Hong Kong who is dear friends with the owners, a father and son.  After the former and the latter are murdered, Chuck finds himself on the run from the ""organization"" that was responsible.  Never fear, Chuck doesn't run for long and ends up providing some nice roundhouse kicks.  There is one scene in the movie where Chuck fights a guy in front neon lights that are the type of lights that are Times Square caliber.  Therefore, the two men fighting are black silhouettes in front of colorful images, an interesting scene for an action flick.Hellbound and The Hitman are one a dual sided DVD, not my personal favorite.  These movies are as is, meaning no special features, no language options and no chapter selections (yet they are there, just use the remote).  Also these movies aren't in letterbox/widescreen.  I am going to be perfectly honest, the full screen version is fine, and it didn't bother me at all.  I like widescreen and usually prefer it, but I am not one of these fundamentalist that ""if it isn't widescreen I won't watch it"".  Full screen is much better than ""pan and scan"". Forced Vengeance is on a standard disc.  It is presented in letterbox, has language options and does offer the original trailer/preview.I was given this box set by my mom for my birthday and I have to say it is well worth it.  I can see myself watching and enjoying these movies over and over again.",5,"Frights, Fights & Neon Lights",1215475200,"07 8, 2008",2008,2901,"['What', 'wonderful', 'little', 'three', 'pack/', 'box', 'set', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'films', 'only', 'other', 'box', 'set', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'films', 'know', 'one', 'Delta', 'Force', 'Missing', 'Action', 'sagas', 'set', 'really', 'awesome', 'are', 'fan', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'respect', 'reviews', 'title', 'will', 'address', 'film.Frights', 'Hellbound.This', 'movie', 'really', 'sort', 'there', 'even', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'standards', 'Chuck', 'Chicago', 'cop', 'who', 'partner', 'up', 'going', 'Devil', 'sort', 'Satanic', 'being', 'dubious', 'loose', 'ends', 'murder', 'case', 'transpire', 'Windy', 'City', 'movie', 'Sheree', 'J.', 'Wilson', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'Walker', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'movie', 'bit', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'top', 'very', 'entertaining', 'nevertheless.Fights', 'Hitman.This', 'classic', 'revenge', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'darkest', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Hellbound', 'Chuck', 'cop', 'undercover', 'deep', 'undercover', 'so', 'deep', 'could', 'be', 'Darth', 'Maul', 'beard', 'dressed', 'black', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'literally', 'philosophically', 'speaking', 'Hitman', 'very', 'violent', 'film', 'really', 'film', 'noir', 'type', 'vibe', 'essential', 'Norris', 'viewing.Neon', 'Lights', 'Forced', 'Vengeance.This', 'older', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Norris', 'so', 'old', 'trademark', 'beard', ""n't"", 'present', 'only', 'mustache', 'Now', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'make', 'avoid', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'Chuck', 'bouncer', 'casino', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'who', 'dear', 'friends', 'owners', 'father', 'son', 'former', 'latter', 'are', 'murdered', 'Chuck', 'run', 'organization', 'was', 'responsible', 'Never', 'fear', 'Chuck', ""n't"", 'run', 'long', 'up', 'providing', 'nice', 'roundhouse', 'kicks', 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', 'Chuck', 'guy', 'front', 'neon', 'lights', 'are', 'type', 'lights', 'are', 'Times', 'Square', 'caliber', 'Therefore', 'two', 'men', 'fighting', 'are', 'black', 'silhouettes', 'front', 'colorful', 'images', 'interesting', 'scene', 'action', 'flick.Hellbound', 'Hitman', 'are', 'one', 'dual', 'sided', 'DVD', 'not', 'personal', 'favorite', 'movies', 'are', 'meaning', 'special', 'features', 'language', 'options', 'chapter', 'selections', 'yet', 'are', 'there', 'just', 'use', 'remote', 'Also', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'letterbox/widescreen', 'am', 'going', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'full', 'screen', 'version', 'fine', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'like', 'widescreen', 'usually', 'prefer', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'fundamentalist', ""n't"", 'widescreen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Full', 'screen', 'much', 'better', 'pan', 'scan', 'Forced', 'Vengeance', 'standard', 'disc', 'presented', 'letterbox', 'language', 'options', 'offer', 'original', 'trailer/preview.I', 'was', 'given', 'box', 'set', 'mom', 'birthday', 'have', 'say', 'well', 'worth', 'can', 'see', 'watching', 'enjoying', 'movies', 'over', 'again']",N/A
1015973,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000HT38HQ,trebe,"[0, 0]","This collection contains three Chuck Norris action films on two DVD&#8217;s, at a bargain price.  The films Hellbound (1994) and The Hit Man (1991) are on one dual-sided disc, while Forced Vengeance (1982) is on the second disc.  Norris specialized in mostly b-grade action flicks, and while none of these films are among his best, the collection still earns a good rating because of the very low cost.Hellbound (Rating: 2 stars)This unintentionally amusing effort from Canon Productions, is directed by Chuck&#8217;s younger brother Aaron Norris (Walker Texas Ranger).  This buddy cop film features the elder Norris, and Calvin Levels, as two Chicago detectives, who journey to Israel, where they tangle with an ancient being with supernatural powers.The Hit Man (Rating: 2.5 stars)Another Canon production, directed by Aaron Norris.  Chuck plays Cliff Garrett, a cop who gets double crossed by his partner (Michael Parks).  Presumed dead, Garrett now operates in the Seattle area posing as a hit man for an underworld organization.  After a good start, the film bogs down, as Garrett becomes the mentor to a young boy, while rival underworld groups vie for position.  The action finally elevates at the end, as Garrett predictably faces his former partner.Forced Vengeance (Rating: 3 stars)Set mostly in Hong Kong, Norris plays Josh Randall, the head of security for a casino.  When the owner of the casino and his son are murdered, Randall attempts to keep the woman who now owns the casino from falling into the hands of an underworld gang.  This old school effort, features some interesting locations, more martial arts, and less gunplay.  Unfortunately, the fight scenes are a bit below par.While none of these films is among his best, Norris fans will probably appreciate them, and the low cost, also makes the set attractive to action fans with just a casual interest.",4,an economical collection of b grade Norris films&#8230;,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,1876,"['collection', 'three', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'action', 'films', 'two', 'DVD', '8217', 's', 'bargain', 'price', 'films', 'Hellbound', '1994', 'Hit', 'Man', '1991', 'are', 'one', 'dual-sided', 'disc', 'Forced', 'Vengeance', '1982', 'second', 'disc', 'Norris', 'specialized', 'mostly', 'b-grade', 'action', 'flicks', 'none', 'films', 'are', 'best', 'collection', 'still', 'good', 'rating', 'very', 'low', 'cost.Hellbound', 'Rating', '2', 'stars', 'unintentionally', 'amusing', 'effort', 'Canon', 'Productions', 'directed', 'Chuck', '8217', 'younger', 'brother', 'Aaron', 'Norris', 'Walker', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'buddy', 'cop', 'film', 'elder', 'Norris', 'Calvin', 'Levels', 'two', 'Chicago', 'detectives', 'who', 'journey', 'Israel', 'where', 'tangle', 'ancient', 'being', 'supernatural', 'powers.The', 'Hit', 'Man', 'Rating', '2.5', 'stars', 'Canon', 'production', 'directed', 'Aaron', 'Norris', 'Chuck', 'Cliff', 'Garrett', 'cop', 'who', 'double', 'crossed', 'partner', 'Michael', 'Parks', 'Presumed', 'dead', 'Garrett', 'now', 'Seattle', 'area', 'posing', 'hit', 'man', 'underworld', 'organization', 'good', 'start', 'film', 'bogs', 'down', 'Garrett', 'mentor', 'young', 'boy', 'rival', 'underworld', 'groups', 'vie', 'position', 'action', 'finally', 'end', 'Garrett', 'predictably', 'former', 'partner.Forced', 'Vengeance', 'Rating', '3', 'stars', 'Set', 'mostly', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Norris', 'Josh', 'Randall', 'head', 'security', 'casino', 'When', 'owner', 'casino', 'son', 'are', 'murdered', 'Randall', 'keep', 'woman', 'who', 'now', 'casino', 'falling', 'hands', 'underworld', 'gang', 'old', 'school', 'effort', 'interesting', 'locations', 'more', 'martial', 'arts', 'less', 'gunplay', 'Unfortunately', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'par.While', 'none', 'films', 'best', 'Norris', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'appreciate', 'low', 'cost', 'also', 'set', 'attractive', 'action', 'fans', 'just', 'casual', 'interest']",N/A

However, I would like to mention that the sound and picture quality of HellBound and The Hitman is not that good. In particular, the sound quality  in The Hitman is poor and not very clear.  I had to turn up the volume to hear what they were saying. It seemed to me like they were whispering instead of talking aloud. This is a 2 disc set. HellBound and The Hitman are together in one double sided disc. The other disc consists of Forced Vengeance, which is a much better movie. This movie, unlike the other two, has a very good picture and sound quality. You will see Chuck Norris deliver some of his greatest fights here. This DVD set is full of action and adrenaline from beginning to end. Another thing worth mentioning is that HellBound and The Hitman have no movie menus. Both are full screen versions.
