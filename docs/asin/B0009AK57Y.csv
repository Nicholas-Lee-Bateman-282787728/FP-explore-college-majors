903172,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B0009AK57Y,A Customer,"[3, 3]","Having just completed watching Doctor Who: the complete first series in bits and pieces over the past fortnight I can honestly day what a treat it is. This series is a startling re-imagining of the world's longest running television show and is destined to satisfy both long-term fans and entrance newbies alike.Kudos should certainly go to writer/director and producer Russell T. Davies who grew up with the show and has treated this revival of it with the type of iconic reference it deserves. Of course, much of the congratulations must also go to the beautiful Billie Piper as Rose and the acclaimed Christopher Eccleston who offered to step into the shoes of the mystifying Time Lord and intergalactic do-gooder known only as the Doctor.Both Piper and Eccleston give superb performances, totally involving us in their characters - and it's interesting to watch their growth as friends and companions as the series progresses. Gone are the makeshift cardboard sets and men in rubber alien suits, for this Doctor has been updated to current sensibilities, reflecting the hip, stylish and youth culture of England today.The long downtrodden, flimsy budget was eradicated, and the show was reinvigorated, with top-notch special effects and strong scripts, and even some surprising co-stars. With the series as a whole really pushing the boundaries of what television can offer.These thirteen episodes are loosely linked the tenth Doctor finds he is immersed in a sequential scheme to influence the events of his life. Over the course of thirteen episodes, the Doctor and Rose travel to Earth's past, present, and future to unravel the mysteries of the Bad Wolf. Of course the clues are subtle and the masterminds behind the conspiracy are not revealed until the very last episode. Meanwhile, however, Rose is whisked away to all sort of wonderful places, both in the past and the present.The stories are tight, mesmerizing, speedy, clever, amusing and throughout the course of the series we are introduced to a variety of characters: there's the cocky and brash American time traveler - and perhaps even bisexual Captain Jack (John Barrowman) who accompanies the Doctor and Rose in the final four stories; Rose's mother Jackie (Camille Coduri), who hates the Doctor for constantly whisking her daughter away into danger.There's also Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) Rose's on again off again boyfriend whose wimpy demeanor tends to put the good Doctor off. The stories also present us with an amazing amount of strength and power - we are transported to the 19th century where we meet Charles Dickens (played lovingly by Simon Callow) and then swept 5 billion years into the future where we witness the end of the world from a satellite orbiting in space.There's a Dalek invasion force numbering in tens of thousands, exotic aliens in the form of flatulence forming Slitheens, shop window dummies that kill, 19th Century Cardiff where mysterious blue ghosts form through the gas lights, a giant space ship which obliterates Big Ben, and the London blitz where people have gas masks embedded into their faces. Rose also gets to visit her father the moment before he died, in the process; however, she causes a rift in time and space.Of course, nothing ever stays the same and one of the unique qualities of the show is that the cast keeps changing. Whilst Billie Piper stays on for the next series - which is rumored to have an even bigger budget as the first, and is currently screening in Australia and other Commonwealth countries and has recently wrapped up in the UK - we are given a new Doctor with Scottish actor David Tennant taking on the prized role.There's certainly nothing cheesy or cheap about this series and it features some suburb acting by Eccleston and Piper and it is certainly going to be a fitting legacy for the series as a whole. Now one can only wait with bated breath for next July when the second series will hopefully be released on DVD and where the Doctor will be faced with even more intergalactic archenemies including the return of the dreaded Cybermen!

903173,ADOUBP7AMWGKU,B0009AK57Y,"Adam Cole ""adamjoncole""","[28, 52]","I've been a Doctor Who fan since the 1970s and was delighted when I heard the series was being revived. I was feeling pretty pleased for the first few episodes - the show had been updated, the effects were better, and the Shakespere-style acting of yesteryear was gone. The new Doctor was also a nice change, demonstrating that the character can be variable enough to go from being an aristocrat (Jon Pertwee) to somebody's goofy handyman uncle (Christopher Eccleston. It also helped that two of my favourite old enemies - the Autons and the Daleks - reappeared in this series. The Daleks, in particularly, were really nicely revamped and actually seemed scary (though more through their actions than their appearance). HOWEVER, I noticed a lot of problems with the new series that I believe - once all the hype and backslapping about the series dies down - will start to work against it. These are:1. CLIMAX-RESOLUTION: Probably the biggest problem. Each episode has a fast paced plot... until the end. Then, quite noticeably, the story runs out of puff. It's as if the writer (especially Russel T. Davies) suddenly realises that the story is supposed to end now and he hasn't worked out how to do it. For this reason, the climax of most of the stories seems like a tacked-on, half-hearted effort (e.g., ""Parting Of The Ways""). Typically we get to see a brief struggle between the Doctor and the villain/problem, followed by an almost instantaneous victory. The victory is rarely due to the intelligence of the characters, and usually involves pure luck or a really simple solution that takes a couple of seconds to complete. Even worse is when the solution is an utterly implausible cop-out like the one we see in the final episode. There is almost no dramatic tension toward the end of each episode and no sense of concern that the Doctor might not win. Rather, we just get to sit and wait for the next easy solution to pop up.2. EASY ENEMIES: The villains the Doctor encounters in this series are typically pretty fearsome - until it comes time to actually face them. Then they go down in a heap without any fight at all. We first see this with the Autons, being defeated within seconds with a simplistic gimmick. I spent most of the series thinking ""Gee that was easy. Why were they so worried?"" At least the Daleks got to do a bit of damage until their ultimately ridiculous defeat. It's when you realise they've been defeated in such a pathetic way that you might start wondering ""Did the writer actually put any thought into this story?"" The old series had its flaws, but it never came up with extreme grasping-at-straws style solutions.3. ROSE: I got the impression that the writers were trying to shove the Doctor's new companion down our throats every chance they got (most of the series centred on her). There's never been a companion in the series that has been as over-hyped as Billie Piper's Rose Tyler. Old fashioned as I am, I liked it when the Doctor's companions had a bit of class, or if they lacked it, at least had intelligence. The character of Rose is certainly not intelligent and is about as classy as Roseanne Barr. It doesn't help that she speaks like she failed the fourth grade, and can't seem to say the letter ""r"" without turning it into a ""w."" In the episode with the flatulent aliens, I kept wondering when she was going to join in, or at least ask the Doctor to pull her finger.4. AWFUL COMPANIONS: The additional ""companions"" also aren't great. Rose's mother Jackie is even less classy than Rose and can't seem to say anything without throwing a fit. Rose's boyfriend Mickey is a major loser who seems to be in the show as both the comic relief and the ""token black guy."" The biggest letdown was Captain Jack, supposedly a swashbuckler-type character (although we never really see this), whose main claim to fame (and apparently the only thing about him that the writers considered significant) is that he is gay. Wow. In the classic series, the companions used to have a bit more to them than this lot does.5. EARTH: For some unfathomable reason, the writers of the show decided to confine almost every episode to Earth or a satellite close to it. It's as if they aren't able to think beyond a London or Earth setting. Confining the series to one planet is a big mistake and it's going to get boring fast.6. DUMBING IT DOWN: I had the sense that the show had been dumbed down as much as possible in order to make it appeal to a bigger audience. I know they wanted the show to have the best chance it could, but this kind of display just smacks of selling out to me. The old series worked with all its high scientific concepts, regardless of the fact that none of us really understood them.7. CHEESY MELODRAMATIC MUSIC: The music is either ""stirring music"" for the emotive scenes (sounding like the soundtrack of a bad 60s romance movie) or ""spooky music"" (which sounds like Enya doing a warm up) for supposedly deep scenes.8. MORE WILL-THEY-WON'T-THEY RUBBISH: Finally, they had to include a soap opera element, with the possibility of a romance between the Doctor and Rose. Name one TV show these days that doesn't have the will-they-won't-they component. Again, another case of selling out in order to get viewers.In short, I found the series disappointing and I really didn't want to. The whole thing seemed to me like a lot of bells and whistles, designed to draw in viewers, but lacking the necessary substance beyond the surface glitter. Great special effects cannot cover for poor writing indefinitely. Eventually, when the novelty fades, people are going to start wondering why they praised this show so highly, and they'll probably start casting a fond eye back to the way it was. Trust me, I'm already there.",3,Dumbing Down A Legend,1163203200,"11 11, 2006",2006,5755,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fan', '1970s', 'was', 'delighted', 'when', 'heard', 'series', 'was',

Christopher Eccleston's portrayal is spot on - quirky but lots of fun; serious when he needs to be. From the first episode, he seems very comfortable with the role. Great casting call.The story arcs are very good. Where the original version of the show had usually four and occasionally six episodes that made up a story, each 45 minutes story here is self-contained. However, many of the stories give tidbits into the bigger story of the season. It's a great way of doing the show.Effects are infinitely better than the original Who as is the increased use of location shooting. True Whovians won't be disappointed by lack of continuity: it's all there plus some new things that need to be filled in (the Time Lords are gone? How did that happen?)

It is so great to finally see the Doctor back on the air.  Though I loved the Paul McGann movie, I didn't think there would be many people out there who would have their eyes caught by the movie.  Which is sad because apparently it means that the DVD of the movie will never come to the states.  Still, we have this new series...and there are a lot of good things about this new series.  Chris Eccleston's Doctor is a fascinating Doctor.  Even more fascinating if you are familiar with all the other Doctors, at least through the purchase of the DVDs.  You can see the hawkishness in the face of Chris, much like that of the 1st Doctor and the 8th Doctor, the grin of the 4th Doctor, the mystery of the 7th Doctor, and the well insanity of the 6th Doctor...among others.  And yet, and yet there is so much more in this new series.  We have the mystery of the Time Wars, the good and the bad of traveling with the Doctor (as seen with Rose's mom and boyfriend), we have intimate story's like Father's Day and Dalek stories as in, well, Dalek and Bad Wolf and Parting of the Ways.  What is really good about all this is that the people who are writing for the series really love the Doctor Who mythos and really want to add something new, something different, yet also still firmly grounded in who Who is.  As the 9th Doctor would say, ""fantastic!""  The only frown that I have is this, that sadly Chris is only the Doctor for one season and apparently there will not be anymore 9th Doctor novels.  I really wish the BBC would expand on the 9th Doctor's world (how he regenerated from the 8th to the 9th, besides the 8th Doctor's book The Gallifrey Chronicles) by showing him before he came to Rose, such as how he acted and how he faced his own race's destruction in the Time Wars.

I'm by no means a whovian or whatever they call themselves, just a fan of sciFi. I've seen the rest of the series and just now got a hold of season 1. There are some interesting episodes, but to be blunt this version of the doctor is a complete and utter tool. The character obviously looks down on humans and pretty much says as much a couple times. (This is one of the things that concerned be about The 11th Hour when Matt Smith's Doctor started babbling about humans filming the end of the world on their cell phones. Apparently forgetting no one on the planet knew it was the end of the world, just something spectacular happening in the sky. But that's another rant) Honestly (and this is hardly a spoiler since there's 5 other seasons with two other doctors) when this doctor dies and regenerates that's about the best scene in the whole series. Mostly because I know how good the Tennant stuff is. I think had I suffered through this when it was released new, I'd have never gotten through it at all and wouldn't have bothered to watch any of the Tennant or Smith stuff.  Christopher Eccleston's actual acting is great, the stories are actually alright, it's just...

903193,ABRKIJ6D4V42O,B0009AK57Y,"Amazon Customer ""space_hamster""","[5, 7]","It was once said by Harlan Ellison that negative reviews are easier to write. In which case this review for the new series will be extremely short. The new Doctor Who had a unique challenge - how to update a forty-year-old TV show for a modern audience that expected a much faster-paced story than the classic series could provide? The answer is a textbook-perfect example of how to update an old show for modern audiences.Everyone in the cast and crew deserve credit for the great work they did. From the managers at BBC TV for choosing Russell T. Davies to revive the show. To Phil Collinson and Julie Gardiner for fostering a creative environment in which the writers and actors can shine. To the Mill FX for providing the most mind-blowing effects in a UK-based TV series for decades. And finally to the actors themselves for bringing a zing and a zest for life that the old series didn't always have.Billie Piper (as Rose) is the biggest standout performance throughout the entire series. She brings a strength, charisma and believability to the role that makes her character the most unique in the show's forty-plus-year history. And Christopher Eccleston also deserves credit for bringing the Doctor's portrayal into the 21st-Century. This is still (to paraphrase) absolutely the same man, but rewritten for a much more cynical harder-to-please audience.The special features on this boxset are just terrific. The commentaries are definitely a highlight. Unfortunately, apart from a BBC interview Chris doesn't make an appearance. But Billie Piper does a commentary on two episodes. But the award for Best DVD Commentary on this boxset has to go to Steven Moffat, John Barrowman and Dave Houghton for The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances. In addition to being an informative commentary, it's also a very amusing one. Some highlights being both Moffat and Barrowman gleefully pointing out the ""gay Officer's club"". And listening to Moffat desperately backflipping through plot hoops to justify the appearance of a tape recorder in World War 2 Britain. Barrowman is a real livewire, always ready with a charismatic quip. And it's an absolute delight to see that Steve Moffat in real life is as witty and clever as his scripts are.A word-of-warning however to classic series fans: The new series is most definitely not like old Who. In addition to the 45-minute episodes, there's much less time for the dense leisurely plotting and science-fiction themes that were such a huge favourite of Eighties who fans. The burping bin and the farting Slitheen might also put old fans off watching the show. But the biggest turnoff for conservative classic series fans has to be the burgeoning romance between the Doctor and Rose. A plot development which would've been an absolute no-no to Old Who fans. Anyone who's been reading the Dr Who fan forums would've noted that these developments have alienated  a large number of Old School Classic Series fans, in addition to attracting new ones.In conclusion, the 1st Series Boxset is strongly recommended for those wanting Family-friendly entertainment for a cold Winter's night.

A friend had recommended the show to me over the summer and I tried it but found myself unable to get through episode one. I found the graphics and the acting to be sub-par. But my dad kept talking about it. And I mean KEPT. Like brought it up every day on our morning bus ride to the city. I told him I didn't like to watch shows not from the beginning (which would be quite a trick since the show started back in the 1960s and has been on and off since, being most recently rejuvenated in 2005). Finally, after he'd driven me crazy for...a few days, I agreed to watch the show, starting from the beginning of 2005 (he said you can start with 2010, but that's not my style).I'm glad I did because once I watched for a bit longer, I found myself actually enjoying it. Sure, the acting isn't the greatest (I often find that British shows don't have the best acting) and the special effects are greatly lacking (some of it is so incredibly old fashioned to the point where things that should be creepy feel more silly than creepy-I know sometimes they're staying true to the original series, but couldn't the Daleks have done with an upgrade?), but for some reason it's still pretty addictive.I think that discovering that Billie Piper of The Secret Diary of a Call Girl was the first of the companions amused me enough to give it a chance.The show, it turns out, is fairly clever. Sometimes the cleverness has to do with plays on history (such as meeting Agatha Christie and resolving the question of where she was for the seven days that she couldn't remember and having her think she failed as a writer) and other times it has to do with the characters.Considering the number of changes in the Doctor's companion, they do a good job of integrating each new personality so that it actually feels like they are close to the Doctor. Some are better than others of course, but always you can feel the bond that is developed.I think the thing I like best about the show is the way they handle serious issues, (SPOILER) such as the departure of Rose (giving a plausible explanation without killing her while keeping her relevant, at least for season three) and the Doctor's Daughter. I wish they did more in terms of letting us know about the Doctor, though I get that the point is that we don't know a lot. They slowly build information over the course of the show and we learn something new about him all the time.I'm only mid-season four so I can't wait to see where things go. I've heard good things about the episode I'm up to (The Library).I also particularly like how many episode are joint episodes, spanning two, sometimes even three, episodes per arc. It really allows you to get involved and to care about the characters, even when they are temporary.The concept of time travel is a complicated and confusing one, which has yet to satisfactorily be explained. You can't change events that are fixed but some are in flux and those ones can be changed. How do you determine one over the other? The Doctor knows. Not the most satisfactory answer. It may be further addressed later, but seeing as I'm pretty far into the show, I don't think so.",4,Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey,1308614400,"06 21, 2011",2011,3246,"['couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'father', 'kept', 'bugging', 'show', ""'d"", 'recently', 'discovered', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'A', 'friend', 'had', 'recommended', 'show', 'summer', 'tried', 'found', 'unable', 'get', 'episode', 'one', 'found', 'graphics', 'acting', 'be', 'sub-par', 'dad', 'kept', 'talking', 'mean', 'KEPT', 'brought', 'up', 'day', 'morning', 'bus', 'ride', 'city', 'told', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'watch', 'shows', 'not', 'beginning', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'trick', 'show', 'started', 'back', '1960s', 'been', 'being', 'most', 'recently', 'rejuvenated', '2005', 'Finally', ""'d"", 'driven', 'crazy', 'few', 'days', 'agreed', 'watch', 'show', 'starting', 'beginning', '2005', 'said', 'can', 'start', '2010', 'not', 'style', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'because', 'once', 'watched', 'bit', 'longer', 'found', 'actually', 'enjoying', 'Sure', 'acting', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'often', 'find', 'British', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'best', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'greatly', 'lacking', 'so', 'incredibly', 'old', 'fashioned', 'point', 'where', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'creepy', 'feel', 'more', 'silly', 'creepy-I', 'know', 'sometimes', ""'re"", 'staying', 'true', 'original', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'Daleks', 'have', 'done', 'upgrade', 'reason', 'still', 'pretty', 'addictive.I', 'think', 'discovering', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'Secret', 'Diary', 'Call', 'Girl', 'was', 'first', 'companions', 'amused', 'enough', 'give', 'chance.The', 'show', 'out', 'fairly', 'clever', 'Sometimes', 'cleverness', 'do', 'plays', 'history', 'such', 'meeting', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'resolving', 'question', 'where', 'was', 'seven', 'days', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'having', 'think', 'failed', 'writer', 'other', 'times', 'do', 'characters.Considering', 'number', 'changes', 'Doctor', 'companion', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'integrating', 'new', 'personality', 'actually', 'are', 'close', 'Doctor', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'course', 'always', 'can', 'feel', 'bond', 'developed.I', 'think', 'thing', 'like', 'best', 'show', 'way', 'handle', 'serious', 'issues', 'SPOILER', 'such', 'departure', 'Rose', 'giving', 'plausible', 'explanation', 'killing', 'keeping', 'relevant', 'least', 'season', 'three', 'Doctor', 'Daughter', 'wish', 'did', 'more', 'terms', 'letting', 'know', 'Doctor', 'get', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'lot', 'slowly', 'build', 'information', 'course', 'show', 'learn', 'something', 'new', 'time.I', ""'m"", 'only', 'mid-season', 'four', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'where', 'things', 'go', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'episode', ""'m"", 'up', 'Library', '.I', 'also', 'particularly', 'how', 'many', 'episode', 'are', 'joint', 'episodes', 'spanning', 'two', 'sometimes', 'even', 'three', 'arc', 'really', 'get', 'involved', 'care', 'characters', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'temporary.The', 'concept', 'time', 'travel', 'complicated', 'confusing', 'one', 'yet', 'satisfactorily', 'be', 'explained', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'events', 'are', 'fixed', 'are', 'flux', 'ones', 'can', 'be', 'changed', 'How', 'do', 'determine', 'one', 'other', 'Doctor', 'knows', 'Not', 'most', 'satisfactory', 'answer', 'may', 'be', 'further', 'addressed', 'later', 'seeing', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'far', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so']",Doctor Who: The Complete First Series

Forget this not holding up well in 10 years, this already feels dated and stupid.But the special effects really are (almost) comparable to contemporary American science fiction shows like ""Battlestar Galactica"" (which has the same problem with alien/futuristic people wandering around in contemporary clothes that ""Dr. Who"" does).

Where Tom Baker left off, this guy picks up.  Sylvester McCoy's subtle underplay and quick mumblings is not understood, yet this guy ""The Escalator"" is well understood without even explaining.  Rose is only ""tollerable"" to him and vica-versa.  The personalities are so contrast that it is a lesson in excpting(as in both of them) without understanding them.  DW's ""anchor"" as said by the editor review is the rare and very deep explamation for exactly ""who"" and ""what"" in the Planet of Hades he is.  The TARDIS(since Paul McGann) has been totaly redifined from the inside(as I predicted) and is a post-modern(as in NOT modern) disaster with convention thrown in for style not function.  buttons are replaced by knobs(transistor radio that is) a huge wall mounted veiwing screen is replaced by a tiny lap top computer for the outside world(as in William Hartnel's TV display)  By the way, Will and Pat's classic Doctor Who was what the producers were going for here.  The clunky, campy and comical and serious mixed together with as much beleviblity as possible.  And it works, farts and all.  I don't normally think so but in this it's the exception.  Just PU LEEZ don't think of Eddie Murphy's stupid ""Nutty Professor"" movies.  Those were just stupid and not to be compared.  Although the classics didn't have ""farting aliens"" Patric Troughton was just as odd ball in the Luner epsiod where he checked everyone's shoes for infections(while the moonbase persons were still waring them).

903210,A1X3U7TT9XXJ9V,B0009AK57Y,"Blake Elder ""Blakey""","[13, 51]","I was quite excited at the prospect of a new Doctor Who series - the old show is a classic, a powerful icon of sci-fi culture.  What we have here, however, is a greatly flawed revamp of the show.  The writer and producers obviously went all out to reshape and redefine the entire Dr Who legend, no doubt to draw in a new generation of viewers.  One aspect you could definitely describe as an improvement - the CG effects are quite impressive and lightyears ahead of what they had twenty years ago.  Apart from that, however, there is little that I can say in its favour.  It has a sleekness to it which is very modern, and perhaps over-emphasised.  The main issues I have with this version are:The One Episode Story Format over the Old Multi-Episode Story Format:  Most stories in the old Doctor Who ran for several half-hour episodes.  At the end of each half-hour there would be some sort of cliff-hanger.  In this new version, the setting for the story is introduced, the Dr and his companions walk around finding out what is going on, and after twenty minutes or so, a highly dangerous situation would become a apparent - eg. A practically unstoppable Dalek becomes active.  Then the pace would begin to quicken, the situation would appear hopeless, and in some completely corny way, it would be resolved in the final couple of minutes.In the meantime, we would be subject to an enormous amount of sentimentality as the Dr and his companions talk about their feelings or gaze into each other's eyes or something else as equally inane and inappropriate for the situation they are in.  Why so much emotionalism?  Is it due to that Russell T. Davies guy?  Is he forgetting which genre Dr Who is?  Please get a new writer.By changing the format of the show, they have sabotaged a very effective formula for the telling of stories in the Dr Who universe.  It worked for decades.  Why did they change it?This format also includes the most grating musical scores I have ever been subjected to.  It mirrors the exponentially accelerating pace of each episode, getting louder and more obnoxious as it moves along.  By the time you get to the overly-dramatic and implausible resolution of the episode, you are being bombarded by a cacophony of sound right off the decibel range.  It doesn't add to the drama, it just enrages you.The last issue I wish to mention is the layout of the TARDIS - it's organic look, like a greenhouse merged with a bad abstract painting, doesn't work.  The console might look appropriate in a old oil refinery that nature has tried to claim back, but not as the central controls and brain of a ultra-advanced space/time vehicle.

903225,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B0009AK57Y,Caleb Williams,"[4, 4]","Now to start off I must admit something, I was never a fan of the old series as I simply saw them as too silly and a bit too pompous. Also before I address the actual show I would like to address a reviewer who gave this 1 star by saying the Dr. calls the Tardis a spaceship and it never leaves Earth. This displays that you obviously haven't been paying attention as in the second or third episode the Dr. takes Rose 5 Billion years into the future to the end of the Earth. This episode is primarily featured in space and from Earth.When I first discovered that Russell T. Davies was bringing back the show, I became very excited as I was very curious as to what Russell would bring to the table. At the beginning when the cast was announced, I became sceptical for the first time, Christopher Eccleston as the Doc and Billie Piper of all people as his companion Rose Tyler. These two are a prime example of never judge before you see it for yourself as they both gave excellent acting performances throughout the series. I said earlier that the old series were quite pompous, this was due to the fact that the characters who played the doctor in the past were people with very middle class voices and attitudes and simply it wouldn't fit with todays young audience. This, to some may be a bad thing but to me it's an even better way to re-invent the whole character of Dr Who and show a new side to him that we have never seen before.The relationship between the Dr. & Rose developes into an unrequited love relationship, Rose grows to care for the Dr. more and more through the series to a point where you believe she starts to love him and the Dr. grows into the father figure that Rose never had and gains a responsibility for her to the point where he would risk his life for her. Throughout the series we are introduced to individual characters and taught to appreciate them in the same way as we appreciate the Dr. & Rose. Mickey & Captain Jack are the two more complex side characters in the series, Mickey fighting for the heart of Rose once again as the is drawn ever closer to the Dr. and Captain Jack the feisty heroic American who is featured in only a few episodes and was first introduced to us when the Dr. and Rose took a trip to War Time Britain.A very good reinvention to the series and something that will be a benchmark in history as something that not only changed the Dr. Who image, but something that changed the entire face of Sci-Fi Drama.",5,An Amazing Re-Invention,1204588800,"03 4, 2008",2008,2466,"['Now', 'start', 'off', 'must', 'admit', 'something', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'old', 'series', 'simply', 'saw', 'too', 'silly', 'bit', 'too', 'pompous', 'Also', 'address', 'actual', 'show', 'would', 'like', 'address', 'reviewer', 'who', 'gave', '1', 'star', 'saying', 'Dr.', 'Tardis', 'spaceship', 'never', 'Earth', 'obviously', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'paying', 'attention', 'second', 'third', 'episode', 'Dr.', 'Rose', '5', 'Billion', 'years', 'future', 'end', 'Earth', 'episode', 'primarily', 'featured', 'space', 'Earth.When', 'first', 'discovered', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'was', 'bringing', 'back', 'show', 'became', 'very', 'excited', 'was', 'very', 'curious', 'what', 'Russell', 'would', 'bring', 'table', 'beginning', 'when', 'cast', 'was', 'announced', 'became', 'sceptical', 'first', 'time', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'Doc', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'all', 'people', 'companion', 'Rose', 'Tyler', 'two', 'are', 'prime', 'example', 'never', 'judge', 'see', 'gave', 'excellent', 'acting', 'performances', 'series', 'said', 'earlier', 'old', 'series', 'were', 'quite', 'pompous', 'was', 'due', 'fact', 'characters', 'who', 'played', 'doctor', 'past', 'were', 'people', 'very', 'middle', 'class', 'voices', 'attitudes', 'simply', 'would', ""n't"", 'fit', 'todays', 'young', 'audience', 'may', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'even', 'better', 'way', 're-invent', 'whole', 'character', 'Dr', 'Who', 'show', 'new', 'side', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'before.The', 'relationship', 'Dr.', 'Rose', 'unrequited', 'love', 'relationship', 'Rose', 'care', 'Dr.', 'more', 'more', 'series', 'point', 'where', 'believe', 'love', 'Dr.', 'father', 'figure', 'Rose', 'never', 'had', 'gains', 'responsibility', 'point', 'where', 'would', 'risk', 'life', 'series', 'are', 'introduced', 'individual', 'characters', 'taught', 'appreciate', 'same', 'way', 'appreciate', 'Dr.', 'Rose', 'Mickey', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'are', 'two', 'more', 'complex', 'side', 'characters', 'series', 'Mickey', 'fighting', 'heart', 'Rose', 'once', 'again', 'drawn', 'ever', 'closer', 'Dr.', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'feisty', 'heroic', 'American', 'who', 'featured', 'only', 'few', 'episodes', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Rose', 'took', 'trip', 'War', 'Time', 'Britain.A', 'very', 'good', 'reinvention', 'series', 'something', 'will', 'be', 'benchmark', 'history', 'something', 'not', 'only', 'changed', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'image', 'something', 'changed', 'entire', 'face', 'Sci-Fi', 'Drama']",Doctor Who: The Complete First Series

The cast and the music is good which you could say about previous Doctors episodes, but the special effects are excellent which you could not say about the previous episodes.

Davies marries a deep love for the character and the past history of the show with a modern 21st century sensibility and brings the subtext of the traditional character--the edge of danger, the melancholy of seeing and knowing so much (maybe too much?), the moral gravitas, the whispers of chemistry with the companions--into the text, while keeping much of the sense of wonder and cheeky wit of the original incarnations.I can't say enough good things about Eccleston's Doctor and his more than worthy companion, Rose (Billie Piper).  The two, and the relationship between them, are the heart and soul of the series.  Davies' choice to give Rose a real backstory, characters back home who care about her and worry about her, is a stroke of genius, as they wind in and out of the episodes and fluctuate between acting as a good anchor (giving Rose a base of love and support in our world) and a bad one (trying to drag her into a smaller version of life).The series gets off to a slowish start with the first few episodes.  My initial reaction was ""Okay this doesn't suck and it's nice to see the Doctor wearing something sexier than a long scarf"".  But it still felt like a take it or leave it proposition.  The worst episodes, the two-parter featuring the ridiculously farting Slytheen, are paradoxically where things start to gain traction, as we really start to see the intensity of the Doctor's caring about Rose, and about supporting the side of right and good in the universe.But that's just the beginning.  The show enters a whole new plane in Epsisode 6, Dalek, where the Doctor has a confrontation with the last surviving member of that venerable evil species.  The show fires on all cylinders, from comedic intervals with the bad-guy American gazillionaire collecting alien artifacts, to the Doctor facing his own demons as a genocide and sole survivor of a horrific event, to the potential loss of Rose at the hands (claw? laser arm?) of his most fearsome enemy.From there through Episode 13, it's a stunning ride that just keeps getting better and better, from moments of laugh out loud comedy to ones that have tears flowing.  The addition of con man Jack Harkness in Episode 9 is just icing on the cake.  The final two episodes are near perfection in wrapping up all the myriad themes and storylines of the series and giving Eccleston's Doctor an amazing send-off.My only complaint is that the team of Rose/Eccleston-Doctor/Harkness is so wonderful, it's just too bad that they only get 5 episodes to shine.  I could have done with another 13 before the inevitable regeneration.But.  What a series it is.  It does the job, revitalizing and maturing the Doctor Who character and canon and breathing new life into the entire premise of the show, and does it with such panache and verve and confidence that as much as I enjoyed the old Doctor back in the day, this series has leaped to the front of them all as my favorite ever.  To say I look forward to what David Tennant does in the next series is the understatement of, well, several centuries.",5,Fantastic!,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,3883,"['lot', 'teenage', 'geeks', 'was', 'fan', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'showed', 'PBS', 'early', '1980s', 'mostly', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'bit', 'older', 'Doctors', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'thrown', 'mid', 'late', '1980s', 'newer', 'interests', 'dropping', 'Doctor', 'most', 'PBS', 'stations', 'ultimately', 'cancellation', 'show', 'wandered', 'away', 'Who', 'fandom', 'filing', 'other', 'youthful', 'crushes', 'old', 'bad', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica.I', 'heard', 'ill-fated', '1996', 'movie/Fox', 'TV', 'revival', 'attempt', 'bad', 'reviews', 'kept', 'away', 'casting', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'new', 'Doctor', '2005', 'talk', 'devoted', 'fans', 'new', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'piqued', 'interest', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'watch', 'new', 'series', 'DVD', 'set.In', 'Eccleston', 'Doctor', 'favorite', 'word', 'fantastic', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'deep', 'love', 'character', 'past', 'history', 'show', 'modern', '21st', 'century', 'sensibility', 'subtext', 'traditional', 'character', 'edge', 'danger', 'melancholy', 'seeing', 'knowing', 'so', 'much', 'maybe', 'too', 'much', 'moral', 'gravitas', 'whispers', 'chemistry', 'companions', 'text', 'keeping', 'much', 'sense', 'wonder', 'cheeky', 'wit', 'original', 'incarnations.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'Eccleston', 'Doctor', 'more', 'worthy', 'companion', 'Rose', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'two', 'relationship', 'are', 'heart', 'soul', 'series', 'Davies', 'choice', 'give', 'Rose', 'real', 'backstory', 'characters', 'back', 'home', 'who', 'care', 'worry', 'stroke', 'genius', 'wind', 'episodes', 'fluctuate', 'acting', 'good', 'anchor', 'giving', 'Rose', 'base', 'love', 'support', 'world', 'bad', 'one', 'trying', 'drag', 'smaller', 'version', 'life', '.The', 'series', 'slowish', 'start', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'initial', 'reaction', 'was', 'Okay', ""n't"", 'suck', 'nice', 'see', 'Doctor', 'wearing', 'something', 'sexier', 'long', 'scarf', 'still', 'felt', 'take', 'leave', 'proposition', 'worst', 'episodes', 'two-parter', 'featuring', 'ridiculously', 'farting', 'Slytheen', 'are', 'paradoxically', 'where', 'things', 'start', 'gain', 'traction', 'really', 'start', 'see', 'intensity', 'Doctor', 'caring', 'Rose', 'supporting', 'side', 'right', 'good', 'universe.But', 'just', 'beginning', 'show', 'whole', 'new', 'plane', 'Epsisode', '6', 'Dalek', 'where', 'Doctor', 'confrontation', 'last', 'surviving', 'member', 'venerable', 'evil', 'species', 'show', 'cylinders', 'comedic', 'intervals', 'bad-guy', 'American', 'gazillionaire', 'collecting', 'alien', 'artifacts', 'Doctor', 'facing', 'own', 'demons', 'genocide', 'sole', 'survivor', 'horrific', 'event', 'potential', 'loss', 'Rose', 'hands', 'claw', 'laser', 'arm', 'most', 'fearsome', 'enemy.From', 'Episode', '13', 'stunning', 'ride', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'moments', 'laugh', 'loud', 'comedy', 'ones', 'have', 'tears', 'flowing', 'addition', 'con', 'man', 'Jack', 'Harkness', 'Episode', '9', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'near', 'perfection', 'wrapping', 'up', 'myriad', 'themes', 'storylines', 'series', 'giving', 'Eccleston', 'Doctor', 'amazing', 'send-off.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'team', 'Rose/Eccleston-Doctor/Harkness', 'so', 'wonderful', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'only', 'get', '5', 'episodes', 'shine', 'could', 'have', 'done', '13', 'inevitable', 'regeneration.But', 'What', 'series', 'job', 'revitalizing', 'maturing', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'character', 'canon', 'breathing', 'new', 'life', 'entire', 'premise', 'show', 'such', 'panache', 'verve', 'confidence', 'as', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'old', 'Doctor', 'back', 'day', 'series', 'leaped', 'front', 'favorite', 'ever', 'say', 'look', 'forward', 'what', 'David', 'Tennant', 'next', 'series', 'understatement', 'well', 'several', 'centuries']",Doctor Who: The Complete First Series

Not the best of the new seasons, by any stretch (a few of the episodes here are a bit too silly even for ""Who,"" and the writing in one or two episodes is rather weak - clearly the new writers feeling things out), but a respectable start.My biggest regret here is that Eccleston didn't sign up for another run. Mind you, we got enormously lucky and got Tennant for the second season (he was such fun), but I'd argue that Eccleston was actually the better man to restart the series in Season 1 - at least given the recent backstory that the writers gave him (the Time War, the death of the Doctor's people). Eccleston brings a gravity and melancholy to the part that really work, and that I'm not sure Tennant would have nailed as well (at least not that melancholy, anyway).

Still, as anyone familiar with the show knows, the Doctor is always disoriented and weakened immediately after he regenerates, and the same must be admitted of this first season. It's still better than much of what passes for entertainment nowadays, and I liked it a lot, but it must be admitted that it falls somewhat short of its full potential and of what longtime followers of the renegade Time Lord's adventures have come to expect.Christopher Eccleston's rendition of the Doctor is a compelling one, and he brings a real screen presence and charisma to the role. He's taken on the much beloved eccentricity, lighthearted wackiness, and comforting sense of justice of the character and alloyed it with a bitter sense of sarcasm and a short temper in a convincing fashion (with a streak of arrogance reminiscent of William Hartnell's original Doctor). It's a tough balance to strike, but he manages quite well and gives us a Doctor who is very much alien but very much likeable.The Doctor's companion Rose is also a nice, believable character with a more active role in the stories and a life outside the Tardis--the effects upon both oneself and one's family & friends of whisking oneself away from one's everyday grind and traveling time and space with a cosmic hobo is explored here in a way unprecedented in ""Doctor Who"" history and I found it refreshingly realistic and original. Even if it all does get a bit ""domestic"" sometimes.However, while it's all fine and well to give the show a faster pace in line with contemporary sensibilities and frankly wonderful to endow it with the production values it's always deserved (i.e. cool special effects), the heart of ""Doctor Who"" has always been in the excellent quality of its science fiction storytelling, and that's the part that's really shaky and unsteady here. Actually, the first three stories are truly excellent and well-told, but the quality starts gradually dropping off from there (with peaks nonetheless, like ""Dalek"" and ""The Empty Child""). Many of the stories seem a bit rushed and slapdash, with crisis resolutions annoyingly sudden and unprepared for, like rabbits pulled out of a magician's hat. The worst offender on the latter score transpires in the otherwise exciting and promising season finale, where we get a very literal (!) ""Deus ex Machina"" solution--c'mon folks, even the ancient Greeks got tired of that one.Still, I'm willing to chalk these shortcoming up to regeneration disorientation. Overall, the show is thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable, and it's nice to have the ride of a lifetime (or nine lifetimes, rather) back on the road again.",4,"""Did I mention?

903248,A1RD1LL5E5JZOT,B0009AK57Y,"Crookedmouth "":-/""","[1, 1]","Doctor Who needs little introduction - a TV sci-fi series that started way back in the 1960's that ran more or less continuously until the late 1980's and was required Saturday night viewing for generations of British kids. It was notable for it's scary monster of the week theme, the changing title role, the Doctor's slightly ramshackle mode of conveyance and the variety of &#34;Doctor's Companions&#34;. Sadly, it was also notable for it's limited budget, wobbly sets and man-in-a-rubber-suit aliens. However, despite its failings, it gained a special place in the nation's conciousness and is looked back on with fondness by many.After a seventeen year break, the series restarted in 2005 with Christopher Ecclestone as the tenth Doctor, Billie Piper as his travelling companion Rose and Russell T Davies behind the typewriter to carry the Series through 13 episodes, to wit:- &#34;Rose&#34;- &#34;The End of the World&#34;- &#34;The Unquiet Dead&#34;- &#34;Aliens of London&#34;- &#34;World War Three&#34;- &#34;Dalek&#34;- &#34;The Long Game&#34;- &#34;Father's Day&#34;- &#34;The Empty Child&#34;- &#34;The Doctor Dances&#34;- &#34;Boom Town&#34;- &#34;Bad Wolf&#34;- &#34;The Parting of the Ways&#34;This first of the &#34;reimagined&#34; series has some strong themes, largely based around the Doctor's somewhat patronising admiration for the terribly backward, parochial yet still wonderful people of Earth and his developing (but of course, chaste) relationship with Rose Tyler. It does struggle however, oh yes. The monsters are still mostly rubber suits (human-inhabited or not), most of the scrapes are solved (or at least mitigated) by means of the ubiquitous sonic screwdriver, and the elephant in the room is that all of those scrapes /could/ simply be sorted by the Doctor popping forward (or backward) in time a few more years. Also, while Ecclestone clearly wanted to develop an unique persona - slightly unhinged but terminally optimistic - his mad, bouncy grin simply annoys.I suppose one can forgive, however. After nearly two decades away, some time would be needed to bed in and find feet. And there ARE some outstanding episodes, in particular &#34;Dalek&#34; and &#34;The Empty Child&#34;/&#34;Doctor Dances&#34;. Also, several new and subsequently recurring characters make their entrances; Harriet Jones and Jack Harkness, to name but two, and there are some sweet cameos to spot as well. Interestingly, there is also the genesis of several recurring references and story arcs that make themselves felt in subsequent series, such as &#34;Bad Wolf&#34; and The Time War. Finally, we are also introduced to Mark Gatiss who is a huge asset to the franchise in his recurring and intermittent role as screenwriter (&#34;The Unquiet Dead&#34;).In the end, however, I felt that the series was a bit of a letdown - not half as good as I remembered it to have been when I watched it with my (then) pre-teen daughter. It is nevertheless good entertainment and essential viewing if for no other reason (and it's NOT the only reason) than to provide continuity into the next series.The five discs come with a short &#34;making of&#34; documentary for each episode, plus various trailers commentaries and video diaries.",3,The Good doctor and Bad wolf,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,3236,"['Doctor', 'Who', 'little', 'introduction', 'TV', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'started', 'way', 'back', '1960', 'ran', 'more', 'less', 'continuously', 'late', '1980', 'was', 'required', 'Saturday', 'night', 'viewing', 'generations', 'British', 'kids', 'was', 'notable', 'scary', 'monster', 'week', 'theme', 'changing', 'title', 'role', 'Doctor', 'slightly', 'ramshackle', 'mode', 'conveyance', 'variety', '34', 'Doctor', 'Companions', '34', 'Sadly', 'was', 'also', 'notable', 'limited', 'budget', 'wobbly', 'sets', 'man-in-a-rubber-suit', 'aliens', 'However', 'failings', 'gained', 'special', 'place', 'nation', 'conciousness', 'looked', 'back', 'fondness', 'many.After', 'seventeen', 'year', 'break', 'series', 'restarted', '2005', 'Christopher', 'Ecclestone', 'tenth', 'Doctor', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'travelling', 'companion', 'Rose', 'Russell', 'T', 'Davies', 'typewriter', 'carry', 'Series', '13', 'episodes', 'wit', '34', 'Rose', '34', '34', 'End', 'World', '34', '34', 'Unquiet', 'Dead', '34', '34', 'Aliens', 'London', '34', '34', 'World', 'War', 'Three', '34', '34', 'Dalek', '34', '34', 'Long', 'Game', '34', '34', 'Father', 'Day', '34', '34', 'Empty', 'Child', '34', '34', 'Doctor', 'Dances', '34', '34', 'Boom', 'Town', '34', '34', 'Bad', 'Wolf', '34', '34', 'Parting', 'Ways', '34', 'first', '34', 'reimagined', '34', 'series', 'strong', 'themes', 'largely', 'based', 'Doctor', 'somewhat', 'patronising', 'admiration', 'terribly', 'backward', 'parochial', 'yet', 'still', 'wonderful', 'people', 'Earth', 'developing', 'course', 'chaste', 'relationship', 'Rose', 'Tyler', 'struggle', 'however', 'oh', 'yes', 'monsters', 'are', 'still', 'mostly', 'rubber', 'suits', 'human-inhabited', 'not', 'most', 'scrapes', 'are', 'solved', 'least', 'mitigated', 'means', 'ubiquitous', 'sonic', 'screwdriver', 'elephant', 'room', 'scrapes', '/could/', 'simply', 'be', 'sorted', 'Doctor', 'popping', 'forward', 'backward', 'time', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'Also', 'Ecclestone', 'clearly', 'wanted', 'develop', 'unique', 'persona', 'slightly', 'unhinged', 'terminally', 'optimistic', 'mad', 'bouncy', 'grin', 'simply', 'annoys.I', 'suppose', 'one', 'can', 'forgive', 'however', 'nearly', 'two', 'decades', 'away', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'needed', 'bed', 'find', 'feet', 'ARE', 'outstanding', 'episodes', 'particular', '34', 'Dalek', '34', '34', 'Empty', 'Child', '34', '/', '34', 'Doctor', 'Dances', '34', 'Also', 'several', 'new', 'subsequently', 'recurring', 'characters', 'make', 'entrances', 'Harriet', 'Jones', 'Jack', 'Harkness', 'name', 'two', 'are', 'sweet', 'cameos', 'spot', 'as', 'well', 'Interestingly', 'also', 'genesis', 'several', 'recurring', 'references', 'story', 'arcs', 'make', 'felt', 'subsequent', 'series', 'such', '34', 'Bad', 'Wolf', '34', 'Time', 'War', 'Finally', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'Mark', 'Gatiss', 'who', 'huge', 'asset', 'franchise', 'recurring', 'intermittent', 'role', 'screenwriter', '34', 'Unquiet', 'Dead', '34', 'end', 'however', 'felt', 'series', 'was', 'bit', 'letdown', 'not', 'half', 'as', 'good', 'remembered', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'watched', 'then', 'pre-teen', 'daughter', 'nevertheless', 'good', 'entertainment', 'essential', 'viewing', 'other', 'reason', 'NOT', 'only', 'reason', 'provide', 'continuity', 'next', 'series.The', 'five', 'discs', 'come', 'short', '34', 'making', '34', 'documentary', 'episode', 'various', 'trailers', 'commentaries', 'video', 'diaries']",Doctor Who: The Complete First Series

903266,A13OUB4K10Z7F1,B0009AK57Y,Dennis Evans,"[1, 2]","I have been a Doctor Who fan since the debut of the modern series in 2005.  I have every episode of the modern series on DVD, along with 30 episodes of the 1963-1989 series.Season 1 is my favorite season of the modern series, followed by Season 5 and Season 4 in that order.  Season 1 accounts for 4 of my all-time top 11 episodes and 4 of my top 8 modern episodes - The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, Dalek, Father's Day, and Bad Wolf/The Parting of the Ways, with The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances rating number one on my all-time list.  The corresponding figures for Seasons 2, 3, 4, ""4.5"" (the 4 specials from 2009), and 5 are 0, 2, 1, 0 and 1 episode, in that order.  The only respect in which any other season is better than Season 1 is in the number of really rotten episodes.  Season 5 had only 1 really rotten episode - Victory of the Daleks - compared to 3 for Season 1 (Rose, The End of the World, and the Long Game) and 3 or 4 per year for Seasons 2-4.  I also think that Season 1 contained the most under-rated episode of the modern series - Boom Town.  Boom Town got very negative ratings from the viewers in the Doctor Who Magazine poll and in the Doctor Who Dynamic Rankings web site, but I thought this story had an interesting plot and good acting.  It was very short on action, which probably hurt it with most viewers.Part of my enthusiasm for Season 1 is due to the actors and characters.  Christopher Eccleston did a great portrayal of the Ninth Doctor as angry, enigmatic, lonely, and occasionally vengeful, but also fundamentally brave, honorable, and helpful.  As for the Doctor's companion, Rose Tyler/Billie Piper is my all-time favorite companion.  I also liked the fact that Rose had a meaningful ""back story,"" and I really liked the interplay between the Doctor, Rose, Jackie Tyler (Rose's mother) and Mickey Smith (Rose's boyfriend when she met the doctor).  There was nothing to match this interplay in the later seasons, and the only interactions that came close were those between the Tenth Doctor, his companion Donna, and Wilfred Mott (Donna's grandfather) and those between the Eleventh Doctor, his companion Amy Pond, and her boyfriend Rory Williams.The rest of my preference for Season 1 is due to the writing.  Season 1 included my favorite Steven Moffatt episode (The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances), an episode by Paul Cornell, and an episode by Robert Shearman.  I think that these were the 3 best writers of the modern series, and only Season 1 features all 3 of them.  Moreover, Russell T. Davies, who was the primary writer for Seasons 1-4.5, was at his best during Season 1.  I think he started to burn out from over-work in the later seasons where he was the show's producer.",5,Great Season of Doctor Who,1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,2722,"['have', 'been', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fan', 'debut', 'modern', 'series', '2005', 'have', 'episode', 'modern', 'series', 'DVD', '30', 'episodes', '1963-1989', 'series.Season', '1', 'favorite', 'season', 'modern', 'series', 'followed', 'Season', '5', 'Season', '4', 'order', 'Season', '1', 'accounts', '4', 'all-time', 'top', '11', 'episodes', '4', 'top', '8', 'modern', 'episodes', 'Empty', 'Child/The', 'Doctor', 'Dances', 'Dalek', 'Father', 'Day', 'Bad', 'Wolf/The', 'Parting', 'Ways', 'Empty', 'Child/The', 'Doctor', 'Dances', 'rating', 'number', 'one', 'all-time', 'list', 'corresponding', 'figures', 'Seasons', '2', '3', '4', '4.5', '4', 'specials', '2009', '5', 'are', '0', '2', '1', '0', '1', 'episode', 'order', 'only', 'respect', 'other', 'season', 'better', 'Season', '1', 'number', 'really', 'rotten', 'episodes', 'Season', '5', 'had', 'only', '1', 'really', 'rotten', 'episode', 'Victory', 'Daleks', 'compared', '3', 'Season', '1', 'Rose', 'End', 'World', 'Long', 'Game', '3', '4', 'year', 'Seasons', '2-4', 'also', 'think', 'Season', '1', 'contained', 'most', 'under-rated', 'episode', 'modern', 'series', 'Boom', 'Town', 'Boom', 'Town', 'got', 'very', 'negative', 'ratings', 'viewers', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Magazine', 'poll', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Dynamic', 'Rankings', 'web', 'site', 'thought', 'story', 'had', 'interesting', 'plot', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'short', 'action', 'probably', 'hurt', 'most', 'viewers.Part', 'enthusiasm', 'Season', '1', 'due', 'actors', 'characters', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'did', 'great', 'portrayal', 'Ninth', 'Doctor', 'angry', 'enigmatic', 'lonely', 'occasionally', 'vengeful', 'also', 'fundamentally', 'brave', 'honorable', 'helpful', 'Doctor', 'companion', 'Rose', 'Tyler/Billie', 'Piper', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'companion', 'also', 'liked', 'fact', 'Rose', 'had', 'meaningful', 'back', 'story', 'really', 'liked', 'interplay', 'Doctor', 'Rose', 'Jackie', 'Tyler', 'Rose', 'mother', 'Mickey', 'Smith', 'Rose', 'boyfriend', 'when', 'met', 'doctor', 'was', 'nothing', 'match', 'interplay', 'later', 'seasons', 'only', 'interactions', 'came', 'close', 'were', 'Tenth', 'Doctor', 'companion', 'Donna', 'Wilfred', 'Mott', 'Donna', 'grandfather', 'Eleventh', 'Doctor', 'companion', 'Amy', 'Pond', 'boyfriend', 'Rory', 'Williams.The', 'rest', 'preference', 'Season', '1', 'due', 'writing', 'Season', '1', 'included', 'favorite', 'Steven', 'Moffatt', 'episode', 'Empty', 'Child/The', 'Doctor', 'Dances', 'episode', 'Paul', 'Cornell', 'episode', 'Robert', 'Shearman', 'think', 'were', '3', 'best', 'writers', 'modern', 'series', 'only', 'Season', '1', 'features', '3', 'Moreover', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'who', 'was', 'primary', 'writer', 'Seasons', '1-4.5', 'was', 'best', 'Season', '1', 'think', 'started', 'burn', 'out', 'over-work', 'later', 'seasons', 'where', 'was', 'show', 'producer']",Doctor Who: The Complete First Series

The 1997 film with Paul McGann proved to be a false dawn but this was not the case with last year's tv series.Christopher Eccleston is simply brilliant in the role of the Doctor , displaying the character's traditional love of the underdog but also possesses an almost scary intensity at times. This intensity replaces the eccentricity of the Doctor's earlier incarnations and we are left with the doctor as an inquisitive but highly charged and volatile individual. This is largely because he is the only survivor of his race, the rest of whom were annihilated in a war with the Daleks. The Doctor reacts with fury as the series goes on when he discovers that the Daleks too have survived, instead of perishing in the war as was previously thought...Billie Piper is great in the role of his travelling companion Rose and her growing relationship with the Doctor is handled well, and keeps the viewer interested.Russell T. Davies who wrote the series is a fan of the old Dr Who and has managed to keep so many of the ingredients of the old series in this one. However, updated SFX and hour long episodes usher the Doctor into 21st century tv.Davies' usual great character realisation works a treat in this, as well as the main characters, all the supporting cast are superb - from Rose's mother to Captain Jack  Harkness as the Doctor and Rose's time travelling ally.I won't list all the episodes but they are consistently good and some are outstanding. The episodes that stand out are all of the Dalek appearances, and an episode where Rose goes back in time to meet the father she never knew.Russell T. Davies has written a series with action, wit and humour but also managed to pack in an emotional wallop.The Daleks nearly did not make it into this series due to legal wrangles with the estate of their creator - Terry Nation. Luckily  these differences were resolved and the Doctor's greatest foes made it into this series, a little updated but otherwise the same Daleks that we all know.The main villains of the next series will be the Cybermen - another classic foe of the Doctor, and advance shots of them look superb.Sadly Christopher Eccleston called it a day after making this series, however, having seen the Christmas special with his successor - David Tennant in the role, it looks as though Series Two will be business as usual. Tennant while retaining some of Eccelston's intensity, also brings to the role the eccentricity of the former Doctors. I am really looking forward to the imminent start of Series Two now.In the meantime, fans of Christopher Eccleston wanting to see more of him, are recommended to check out the dvd of 'Let Him Have It' which in my opinion is the actor's best ever performance.",5,Daleks and Cybermen,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,2839,"['kid', 'was', 'glued', 'Dr', 'Who', '1960s', '1970s', '1980s', 'saw', 'slow', 'wind', 'eventual', 'cancellation', '1997', 'film', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'proved', 'be', 'false', 'dawn', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'last', 'year', 'tv', 'series.Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'role', 'Doctor', 'displaying', 'character', 'traditional', 'love', 'underdog', 'also', 'almost', 'scary', 'intensity', 'times', 'intensity', 'eccentricity', 'Doctor', 'earlier', 'incarnations', 'are', 'left', 'doctor', 'inquisitive', 'highly', 'charged', 'volatile', 'individual', 'largely', 'only', 'survivor', 'race', 'rest', 'whom', 'were', 'annihilated', 'war', 'Daleks', 'Doctor', 'fury', 'series', 'when', 'Daleks', 'too', 'have', 'survived', 'instead', 'perishing', 'war', 'was', 'previously', 'thought', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'great', 'role', 'travelling', 'companion', 'Rose', 'growing', 'relationship', 'Doctor', 'handled', 'well', 'viewer', 'interested.Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'who', 'wrote', 'series', 'fan', 'old', 'Dr', 'Who', 'managed', 'keep', 'so', 'many', 'ingredients', 'old', 'series', 'one', 'However', 'updated', 'SFX', 'hour', 'long', 'Doctor', '21st', 'century', 'tv.Davies', 'usual', 'great', 'character', 'realisation', 'treat', 'as', 'well', 'main', 'characters', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'superb', 'Rose', 'mother', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Harkness', 'Doctor', 'Rose', 'time', 'travelling', 'ally.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'list', 'episodes', 'are', 'consistently', 'good', 'are', 'outstanding', 'episodes', 'stand', 'out', 'are', 'Dalek', 'appearances', 'episode', 'where', 'Rose', 'back', 'time', 'meet', 'father', 'never', 'knew.Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'written', 'series', 'action', 'wit', 'humour', 'also', 'managed', 'pack', 'emotional', 'wallop.The', 'Daleks', 'nearly', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'series', 'due', 'legal', 'wrangles', 'estate', 'creator', 'Terry', 'Nation', 'Luckily', 'differences', 'were', 'resolved', 'Doctor', 'greatest', 'foes', 'made', 'series', 'little', 'updated', 'otherwise', 'same', 'Daleks', 'know.The', 'main', 'villains', 'next', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'Cybermen', 'classic', 'foe', 'Doctor', 'advance', 'shots', 'look', 'superb.Sadly', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'called', 'day', 'making', 'series', 'however', 'having', 'seen', 'Christmas', 'special', 'successor', 'David', 'Tennant', 'role', 'Series', 'Two', 'will', 'be', 'business', 'usual', 'Tennant', 'retaining', 'Eccelston', 'intensity', 'also', 'role', 'eccentricity', 'former', 'Doctors', 'am', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'imminent', 'start', 'Series', 'Two', 'meantime', 'fans', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'wanting', 'see', 'more', 'are', 'recommended', 'check', 'out', 'dvd', ""'Let"", 'Him', 'Have', 'opinion', 'actor', 'best', 'ever', 'performance']",Doctor Who: The Complete First Series

I started watching series 5 (with Smith) on Canada's Space Network and started watching series 1 soon after when they began broadcasting it from the beginning. I am enjoying both but I have a special affection for series 1. I think Eccleston is excellent and he has an amazing amount of charm. (After watching a few epsodes of series 2 online I wish I knew why he was replaced by Tennant). Billie Piper is wonderful as his assistant. She works up a good balance between cheeky youthfulness and wide-eyed wonder. I am now sorry I did not watch the series before! I enjoy the variety of issues they deal with in this series.

903275,A2HBRINA3F9YHV,B0009AK57Y,Doctor Trance,"[382, 417]","Having barely seen an episode or two on PBS in my youth, I really got into the series after seeing the 1997 US TV movie. I quickly snatched up every VHS tape, and found every other missing episode and unreleased story on bootleg videos, to obsessively have every inch of existing Doctor Who known to man. I preferred Jon Pertwee's Doc the best, with Troughton and T. Baker next. No need to get into the original classic series, so on with the new one.Right from the start, I really enjoy Eccleston's portrayal of the Doctor. It seems he really did his homework and seems to have found just the right combination of wit and intellect that made so many previous doctors a success. His quick tongue seems to keep up to the fast new pace of the show. While the longer episode, vintage shows had more time for character development and interaction, in today's fast paced world of 32x fast forward speed DVD capability, you can't have 4 to 6 part episodes and expect to keep people's attention to that one storyline. It worked in the 70's, but certainly wouldn't work now.Vintage Doctor Who always had great supporting casts and guest stars, and the new series is no different. Rose's boyfriend and mom keep up nicely to the pace and plotting of the show. Simon Callow gives a great performance as Charles Dickens in the series 3rd episode.Episode 1, Rose, sweeps us back into the whirlwind world of Doctor Who that we all know and love. It seems like it nearly skipped a beat since 1989, with only the surroundings and special effects being updated. It also offers enough info to keep a new viewer interested.  'Rose' is very action packed, much more than most vintage Who stories, and I think it has to be in some way to cater to the thrill-a-minute new millenium that we are all now fully accustomed to.I had seen some sneak preview photos of the Autons before the show aired, and I thought they looked a little awkward and feared they might come across a bit cheesy in live action, however they threw me for a loop after watching Rose, as they looked incredibly lifelike and menacing. Bravo for the special effects wizards who worked on them as they looked brilliant. A superb opening episode to bring us all back into Who!Ep. 2 kept Eccleston's sharp tongue going, and flew us into an alien space station, complete with just about every new concoction of an alien species one can concoct. Actually, the oddest looking species was the human!! A murderous metallic set of spiders is unleashed on a group of interplanetary oglers, wanting to witness the last moments of Earth. The always fashionably-late-in-saving-the-day Doctor has to come to Rose and everyone else's rescue.Ep. 3 takes us to familiar Who territory, a period piece on planet Earth. 1869 to be exact, and Charles Dickens is giving a Christmas Eve performance of A Christmas Carol that gets rudely interrupted by a gas powered, walking corpse. The sets and costumes are superb, and this 19th century Cardiff set story is a real treat.Episodes 4 & 5 are the first two part storyline, which deals with the Slitheen aliens invading Parliament.  It features some hilarious moments when the Slitheen attempt to wear their ""rubber suits"" that impersonate humans.Ep. 6 is what we've all been waiting for:  The Dalek episode.  But alas, it features only one, but that's all it takes for a very strong episode involving an American collector of the future, who happens to have found one remaining Dalek, but doesn't realize how dangerous it really is.  The Doctor, fully aware of Dalek aggression, has to step in and set things straight, with a little help from Rose.Ep. 7, The Long Game, takes us into a satellite space station where people are not returning from certain floors of the station.Ep. 8, one of the strongest and certainly the most emotional of the series, sees Rose wanting the Doctor to allow her to see the father she never knew, however she does something the Doctor would never do, and specifically asks her not to do: interferes with time.Episodes 9 & 10 is another two parter involves the Doctor and Rose in the middle of bomb ridden London circa 1941.  Captain Jack Harkness is introduced and becomes a rival hero character for the Doctor.Ep. 11 involves the return of the Slitheen and their plan to destory Earth.Ep. 12 features a great spoof of reality shows, with the Doctor stuck in the middle.  This episode also features the best cliffhanger of the new show: Rose is kidnapped by the Daleks and the Doctor defiantly proclaims ""I'm gonna blow every last stinkin' one of ya out of the sky"".  Something no previous doctor would have ever said, it's a now classic quote and very characteristic of the new Who era, and the new Doctor.Episode 13, the final battle with the Daleks, is the culmination of startling sci-fi entertainment, and a fine arguement for being the best season in the show's long and storied history.  It extremely disappointing that Eccleston is not returning for Season 2. That is a shame, because his Doctor is extremely well played. Hopefully David Tennant can fill his shoes nicely, and I'm sure the writing will be just as strong as series 1.These are going to be loaded with all the extras found in the UK release.  They initially released bare bones DVD's on Region 2, in 4 volumes, which is how I got them as I had to have each new Who right away, and I can't wait until May 1st, when I will have the first of season 2 in my hands!!  For now, US fans unable to play or get a hold of Region 2 discs, have the Sci-Fi Channel airings and this new set out in July!!",5,The new Doctor Who finally hits America!,1142985600,"03 22,

903280,A3K74JJXH3QAFS,B0009AK57Y,DPK,"[12, 12]","Before it premiered, the big question about the new series of Dr. Who seemed to be, would Russell T. Davies make it an edgy modern drama or have it return to its traditional family-viewing roots. The answer is that Davies, one of the UK's best script-writers, managed to do both.First thing's first, though, the show is to use the Ninth Doctor's expression, ""Fantastic!"" While I've found something to enjoy in nearly every episode of the ""classic"" series (which I'll define as everything from 1963 through the one-off movie with Paul McGann in 1996), rarely has the balance of action and humor been so expertly handled. What's more, by focusing solidly on the relationships between the characters and the ways in which the Doctor's actions affect them (particularly Rose's loved ones), the 2005 incarnation of Doctor Who has an emotional heft that the older episodes seldom achieved.Some would argue (and not without merit) that some of the humor is a bit broad. Indeed, the spoofs of reality shows and aliens with gastro-intestinal issues were not the most subtle. On the other hand, the repartee between the characters (especially when Captain Jack joins the party) is often excellent. High marks go not only to series regulars Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper but also to Noel Clarke who plays Rose's boyfriend Mickey and Broadway veteran John Barrowman who plays the dashing (and it turns out truly heroic) Captain Jack Harkness.Both of the latter characters exemplify one of the series key themes, namely that the Doctor makes people realize that they're better than they knew. Mickey helps Rose get back to the Doctor even though he knows he may lose her again. Jack puts his life on the line for the Doctor (not to mention the whole human race) even though it means almost certain death. I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention Simon Callow's excellent guest spot as Charles Dickens and Nicholas Briggs voice-work in the episode ""Dalek"" which succeeded in turning one of the show's most famous monsters into a fleshed-out character.Obviously, some of the individual episodes stand out. The two-part WW2-era story The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances in particular is a contender for one of the all-time best from the show's 40+ year history (personally I'm baffled by the assertion an earlier viewer made that this story is somehow out of character with the show's past). That said, in many ways the 13-part series is best seen as a single epic storyline, culminating with a battle for the survival of the entire human race.Of course, we know who wins. It is traditional Doctor Who after all, and good always triumphs over evil. At the same time, this is also every bit a modern TV drama, and good doesn't win without a cost. As we see in episode 13 (The Parting of the Ways), the cost is a steep one for many people. The final moments of this episode are sad but also leave you wanting more. Thankfully, the wait won't be nearly as long this time.Addendum (7/7/06): I noticed that someone expressed a view that the price seemed a bit high. To give some context, the SRP for most releases of older Dr. Who episodes has been $25 (less any discounts), and that's for a program that runs about 2 hours. This new release runs 13 hours for $100 (again less any discounts). In short, the amount of material on this new set compares most favorably to the pricing approach established for previous releases.",5,Fantastic!,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,3408,"['premiered', 'big', 'question', 'new', 'series', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'seemed', 'be', 'would', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'make', 'edgy', 'modern', 'drama', 'have', 'return', 'traditional', 'family-viewing', 'roots', 'answer', 'Davies', 'one', 'UK', 'best', 'script-writers', 'managed', 'do', 'both.First', 'thing', 'first', 'though', 'show', 'use', 'Ninth', 'Doctor', 'expression', 'Fantastic', ""'ve"", 'found', 'something', 'enjoy', 'nearly', 'episode', 'classic', 'series', ""'ll"", 'define', 'everything', '1963', 'one-off', 'movie', 'Paul', 'McGann', '1996', 'rarely', 'balance', 'action', 'humor', 'been', 'so', 'expertly', 'handled', 'What', 'more', 'focusing', 'solidly', 'relationships', 'characters', 'ways', 'Doctor', 'actions', 'affect', 'particularly', 'Rose', 'loved', 'ones', '2005', 'incarnation', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'emotional', 'heft', 'older', 'episodes', 'seldom', 'achieved.Some', 'would', 'argue', 'not', 'merit', 'humor', 'bit', 'broad', 'Indeed', 'spoofs', 'reality', 'shows', 'aliens', 'gastro-intestinal', 'issues', 'were', 'not', 'most', 'subtle', 'other', 'hand', 'repartee', 'characters', 'especially', 'when', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'party', 'often', 'excellent', 'High', 'marks', 'go', 'not', 'only', 'series', 'regulars', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'also', 'Noel', 'Clarke', 'who', 'plays', 'Rose', 'boyfriend', 'Mickey', 'Broadway', 'veteran', 'John', 'Barrowman', 'who', 'dashing', 'out', 'truly', 'heroic', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Harkness.Both', 'latter', 'characters', 'exemplify', 'one', 'series', 'key', 'themes', 'namely', 'Doctor', 'people', 'realize', ""'re"", 'better', 'knew', 'Mickey', 'Rose', 'get', 'back', 'Doctor', 'even', 'may', 'lose', 'again', 'Jack', 'life', 'line', 'Doctor', 'not', 'mention', 'whole', 'human', 'race', 'even', 'almost', 'certain', 'death', ""'d"", 'also', 'be', 'remiss', 'did', ""n't"", 'mention', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'excellent', 'guest', 'spot', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'Nicholas', 'Briggs', 'voice-work', 'episode', 'Dalek', 'succeeded', 'turning', 'one', 'show', 'most', 'famous', 'monsters', 'fleshed-out', 'character.Obviously', 'individual', 'episodes', 'stand', 'out', 'two-part', 'WW2-era', 'story', 'Empty', 'Child/The', 'Doctor', 'Dances', 'particular', 'contender', 'one', 'all-time', 'best', 'show', '40+', 'year', 'history', 'personally', ""'m"", 'baffled', 'assertion', 'earlier', 'viewer', 'made', 'story', 'somehow', 'character', 'show', 'past', 'said', 'many', 'ways', '13-part', 'series', 'best', 'seen', 'single', 'epic', 'storyline', 'culminating', 'battle', 'survival', 'entire', 'human', 'race.Of', 'course', 'know', 'who', 'traditional', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'good', 'always', 'triumphs', 'over', 'evil', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'bit', 'modern', 'TV', 'drama', 'good', ""n't"", 'win', 'cost', 'see', 'episode', '13', 'Parting', 'Ways', 'cost', 'steep', 'one', 'many', 'people', 'final', 'moments', 'episode', 'are', 'sad', 'also', 'leave', 'wanting', 'more', 'Thankfully', 'wait', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'nearly', 'as', 'long', 'time.Addendum', '7/7/06', 'noticed', 'someone', 'expressed', 'view', 'price', 'seemed', 'bit', 'high', 'give', 'context', 'SRP', 'most', 'releases', 'older', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'been', '25', 'less', 'discounts', 'program', '2', 'hours', 'new', 'release', '13', 'hours', '100', 'again', 'less', 'discounts', 'short', 'amount', 'material', 'new', 'set', 'most', 'favorably', 'pricing', 'approach', 'established', 'previous', 'releases']",Doctor Who: The Complete First Series
903281,AHJF1J9I4LYVR,B0009AK57Y,Drektath,"[4, 4]","I'm not a stranger to the original run of Doctor Who. The original series could be cerebral, charming, and witty. The production values were notoriously bad on the original run, but as George Lucas has proved with his prequel Star Wars trilogy, big budgets aren't everything.Furthermore, I generally hate time travel in stories. In most cases, the use of time travel is a convenient plot device that opens up several cans of worms that makes the plot unbelievable and contradictory. The writers of this Doctor Who are well aware of this problem. They're also aware that the whole franchise is based largely on time travel. Their solution is one that I approve of: namely, indicate to the audience through clever dialogue that they are well aware of how their writing contradicts last week's episode, but ""kindly ignore it *wink wink, nod nod*"". Frankly, it's nice to have the writers admit that sometimes they're trapped, rather than just blatantly insulting the audience's intelligence by pretending that no conflict exists.I would rate this renewal of the franchise as a massive improvement (I've already insulted fans of the Star Wars prequels, why not go for two and invite howling responses from Doctor Who purists?). Sure, some episodes aren't as good as others, but the highlights from the series exhibit witty dialogue, excellent writing, clever plots, and at their best, genuinely engaging emotional entanglement.For Doctor Who fans of old, I'd say that if you're willing to adapt, this could be a truly rewarding experience. For those that have never heard of Doctor Who (but like well-written science fiction), I think it would be worth a shot. For those that hated Doctor Who in its original run, I think it may be worth a fresh look.To me, this is the proper way to refresh a decades old cherished science-fiction mainstay. It is completely unlike the lobotomy that J.J. Abrams performed on the Star Trek series with his reboot of the franchise (there, I've insulted the neo-trekkies as well, that's some kind of trifecta, right?).I may get around to rating series 2-4, in time, but if I don't, this review stands for all of series 1-4. Eccleston is brilliant as The Doctor. While I initially had reservations regarding Tennant as a replacement, I quickly accepted him as equally brilliant, in his own way, as The Doctor.Fans would do well to check out Torchwood as well.

903284,A1RQQCPDN7ZCHU,B0009AK57Y,"E.A. Week ""reviewer-at-large""","[7, 12]","Fans of TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer who've been feeling bereft since the show's 2003 cancellation should look no further than the first two seasons of the newly revived British series, Doctor Who.  A BBC flagship series from 1963-1989, the updated show bears little resemblance to the quaint, campy, and often hokey old show that Americans might remember from PBS in the 1970s and 1980s.  Dr. Who has been brought forward into the 21st century, modernized, and given a gleaming makeover.  Yes, the special effects still looks cheap by American standards, but the update is still streets more sophisticated than the original series; the quality of the writing and acting more than make up for its visual shortcomings.The smartest decision the Beeb made was to hand the reins of the revived series to maverick writer/ producer Russell T Davies.  The smartest decisions Davies made were 1) to cast Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper as the leads, and 2) to base the structure of the show (a la Kim Possible) almost entirely around Joss Whedon's Buffy.  Davies recognizes that Whedon had hit on a winning formula, which he replicates in loving detail.Rose Tyler (Piper) essentially IS Buffy Summers, minus the Slayer powers.  Green-eyed peroxide blonde?  Check.  Former gymnast?  Check.  Raised by single mother?  Check.  Brave, intelligent, and curious?  Check.  Sarcastic tongue and pop culture vocabulary?  Check.  Doofy but well-meaning best friend who grows into a hero in his own right?  Check.  In love with a centuries-old otherworldy being?  Funny you should ask.  Replace high school with space/ time travel and vampires/ demons with aliens, and you have, in essence, described the new Who.With so much focus on Rose, the Doctor himself seems almost of secondary importance, but that's not really so: Davies and his writers use the profoundly ordinary Rose as the viewer's avenue into the Doctor's bizarre world.  Yes, he's still a space-time traveling alien who rackets about the cosmos in a giant ship that looks like a blue phone booth on the outside, but gone are the loud costumes and outlandish behavior viewers may remember from Doctors past.  Eccleston's Doctor is modern and stripped-down, with buzzcut hair, a black leather coat, and a pronounced northern accent.  He's 80% Rupert Giles and 20% Angel: dry, ironic, sexy, hundreds of years old, and staggering under a burden of unimaginable guilt.  He quickly comes to fill the role of both father figure and mentor to Rose, and in a break with old Who tradition, he becomes her love interest as well.Rounding out the cast are Noel Clarke as Rose's on-again, off-again (ex) boyfriend Mickey Smith (95% Xander Harris and 5% Willow Rosenberg), who starts out useless but by the end of the season has proved his guts and integrity several times over.  Jackie Tyler (Camille Codori) is a trashier version of Joyce Summers: loudmouthed, cuttingly funny, always on the lookout for a shag, but fiercely loyal to and protective of her daughter--even though Rose's new lifestyle bewilders her, and she's deeply suspicious of the Doctor.  Later in the season, Rose and the Doctor are joined by Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), a 51st century omnisexual conman with a heart of gold.An array of aliens and monsters provide the Doctor's adversaries each week, but the real evils he fights are universal: greed (individual and collective), conformity, apathy, and the mother of all monsters, religious fanaticism.  The stories deftly mix humor, horror, romance, and drama, much as Buffy did at its best.  Viewers get a smorgasbord of ""Who's greatest hits:"" travel to the past, travel to the future, new foes, classic foes, human evil, alien evil, and a spectacular regeneration sequence in the season climax.  If the series had not been renewed beyond its first season, Davies would have at least treated his audience to all the classic elements that made the original series so wonderfully inventive.Of all the stories, the two part ""Empty Child/ Doctor Dances"" stands out as not only the best of the season but the best of the series to date (rivaled only by season two's ""Christmas Invasion"").  A creepy, suspenseful thriller set in WWII London, the story unfolds at just the right pace; the guest cast is outstanding; the atmosphere of war-torn London is marvelously evoked; the resolution is joyous without ever descending into schmaltz.  Other highlights include the pilot episode ""Rose,"" the gripping ""Dalek,"" the powerfully emotional ""Father's Day,"" and the hold-no-punches finale, ""Bad Wolf/ Parting of the Ways.""  Of all thirteen episodes, only ""The Unquiet Dead"" feels a little flat.The series would not have succeeded without the formidable talents of Eccleston and Piper, whose chemistry together is tremendous, coming across as completely new and fresh while still evoking the best classic companion-Doctor partnerships.  Purists might quibble at the romantic attachment, but it's mostly very understated and nicely worked into the narrative structure as a whole, never distracting from the stories themselves.Above all, the new series is infused with a powerful sense of love and hope that serve as a welcome antidote to the sometimes crass cynicism of popular culture.  The emphasis on courage and self-sacrifice is especially good to see.  Parents who are looking for thought-provoking entertainment that has real warmth and decency at its core should definitely add the new Who to the family's DVD collection.In short, Who is a terrific television accomplishment.  A new series of this quality would likely be hailed an immediate success, but Who is even more impressive for having shed the clunky embarrassments of its past.  The marvelous essence of the original has been preserved, nurtured into life by the able talents of its cast and crew.  Skip the TV broadcasts (which are badly mangled for commercial time) and splash out some money on the DVDs.  The extras alone make the purchase well worth the investment.  Come discover what so many viewers around the world have already learned: that Who is one of the best things on television.And fans of Buffy may at last discover the program that fills the void in their hearts.",5,The New Buffy,1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,6203,"['Fans', 'TV', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'feeling', 'bereft', 'show', '2003', 'cancellation', 'should',

When disaster comes, he is there. He brings a storm in his wake."" Many would love a ride in Doctor Who's TARDIS, a time-machine ans spacecraft = Time And Relative Dimension In Space. Russell T. Davies overwhelmingly succeeds in rebooting Doctor Who after a 16 year hiatus. This is a wild romp, brilliant; the normal and mundane are mixed together with elements of absolute bizarreness. Christopher Eccleston (Thor: The Dark World) adds his Geordie 'tude as the 9th incarnation of the Doctor. When asked by his soon to be new companion, Rose Tyler (the great Billie Piper) about his distinctive accent, he replies, ""Lots of planets have a North."" We savor northern English culture and history, and series like Manchester'sThe Street, and genre-defyingLife On Mars, U.K.starring Doctor Who alumni John SimmDoctor Who Specials: The Next Doctor, Planet of the Dead, The Waters of Mars, The End of Time Parts 1 & 2.In ""Rose,"" the first wonderful episode, which harkens back to Pertwee's 3rd Doctor and his entrance in ""Spearhead from Space,"" we meet Rose, going about her ordinary day. As the Doctor says, ""You lot, all you do is eat chips, watch telly, go to bed."" Well, Rose's world is about to be rocked. Her mother, Jackie Tyler (the adorable, delightful Camille Coduri,Rumpole of the Bailey), resists the Doctor and his impact on Rose's life.Hang in there past an episode that would have been super but for annoying gaseous aliens (why?) and get to 'The Unquiet Dead,"" where you'll be whisked to Cardiff, Wales, in 1869, with ""Torchwood"" star Eve Myles as a young physic working in a haunted funeral home. A Shakespeare-quoting Dickens (Simon Callow) enters the picture, ""There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy, even for you, Doctor. Shawn Dingwall is marvelous as Rose's wayward father Pete Tyler in the poignant ""Father's Day,"" where Rose travels back to her distant past, with 'No Third Term for Thatcher' posters pasting walls; as the Doctor says, ""The past is another country."" The spooky two-part ""The Empty Child"" and ""The Doctor Dances"" features remarkable acting by Florence Heath as Nancy, helping a group of street kids survive in London during WWII, and introduces Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), a former Time Agent. ""Bad Wolf"" and ""The Parting of the Ways"" are superb social commentary - with the Anne Droid (Anne Robinson) in a brutal form of 'The Weakest Link,' Jack facing two scary female robots (Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine) on 'What Not to Wear,' a sweet contestant Lynda (Jo Joyner) on 'Big Brother' assisting the Doctor, and a new incarnation of an old, relentless foe. The Doctor sends Rose back home in the TARDIS to her mother and Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke), but she can't abide being forced back into normalcy while the Doctor is facing a huge battle. At the end, the Doctor must regenerate into a new, wonderful creation/incarnation, the inimitable David TennantBroadchurch,Spies of Warsaw) as the 10th Doctor Who inDoctor Who: The Complete Second Series.

903304,A3DXVAI08P00HD,B0009AK57Y,Greg,"[2, 6]","I used to be strangely fascinated with Dr Who in my younger days.  His explorations of weird planets and his encounters with bizarre creatures and enemies, from the daleks and cybermen to hostile algae and pool machines, were strangely captivating (despite the tacky special effects).  Still, the series deserved its place as a classic.For a while, Dr Who went quiet.  There was one telemovie but no series.  The BBC handed the task to Russel T. Davies, the writer who created the telemovie 'The Second Coming.'  Christopher Eccleston was chosen for the role of the doctor, while Billie Piper (a very pretty pop singer with a strong accent) was chosen to be his companion.The new series was made in 2005 and shown in several countries.  We are reintroduced to some old enemies (the daleks) and also some new ones.  We also learn some new things about what happens to humanity in the future, and also some things about our past.Overall the new series is much more faster paced than the classical series have been.  The first reason appears to be that instead of five episode stories which slowly lead up to their conclusion, a story is usually self contained in a single episode.  The new series tends to have far more action and less 'cerebral' meditation on arcane science fiction ideas, perhaps because Davies wanted to appeal to a younger audience with a shorter attention span.The weakness of the new series is that some of the stories seem to lead nowhere, are executed too quickly, and at times the emotional interaction between Rose (Billie Piper) and those around her gets too sentimental at times.  Still, I have generally enjoyed the format of the new series, as well as the ideas and the reappearance of old enemies.",4,Good reboot of classic series,1163635200,"11 16, 2006",2006,1727,"['used', 'be', 'strangely', 'fascinated', 'Dr', 'Who', 'younger', 'days', 'explorations', 'weird', 'planets', 'encounters', 'bizarre', 'creatures', 'enemies', 'daleks', 'cybermen', 'hostile', 'algae', 'pool', 'machines', 'were', 'strangely', 'captivating', 'tacky', 'special', 'effects', 'Still', 'series', 'deserved', 'place', 'classic.For', 'while', 'Dr', 'Who', 'went', 'quiet', 'was', 'one', 'telemovie', 'series', 'BBC', 'handed', 'task', 'Russel', 'T.', 'Davies', 'writer', 'who', 'created', 'telemovie', 'Second', 'Coming', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'was', 'chosen', 'role', 'doctor', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'very', 'pretty', 'pop', 'singer', 'strong', 'accent', 'was', 'chosen', 'be', 'companion.The', 'new', 'series', 'was', 'made', '2005', 'shown', 'several', 'countries', 'are', 'reintroduced', 'old', 'enemies', 'daleks', 'also', 'new', 'ones', 'also', 'learn', 'new', 'things', 'what', 'humanity', 'future', 'also', 'things', 'past.Overall', 'new', 'series', 'much', 'more', 'faster', 'paced', 'classical', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'reason', 'be', 'instead', 'five', 'episode', 'stories', 'slowly', 'lead', 'up', 'conclusion', 'story', 'usually', 'self', 'contained', 'single', 'episode', 'new', 'series', 'have', 'far', 'more', 'action', 'less', ""'cerebral"", 'meditation', 'arcane', 'science', 'fiction', 'ideas', 'perhaps', 'Davies', 'wanted', 'appeal', 'younger', 'audience', 'shorter', 'attention', 'span.The', 'weakness', 'new', 'series', 'stories', 'seem', 'lead', 'nowhere', 'are', 'executed', 'too', 'quickly', 'times', 'emotional', 'interaction', 'Rose', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'too', 'sentimental', 'times', 'Still', 'have', 'generally', 'enjoyed', 'format', 'new', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'ideas', 'reappearance', 'old', 'enemies']",Doctor Who: The Complete First Series

Russell was best known as the creator of ""Queer as Folk"" and Christopher was, at least to me, the nasty Duke of Norfolk in 'Elizabeth' starring Cate Blanchett.Now, let me mix in that I am HUGE fan of the Early Doctor Who (read as 16mm telecine and monochromatic and you get the idea). I really enjoy the years from Patrick Troughton to Tom Baker. I like Peter Davidson too.I am a ""fan"" of the 'classic' Doctor Who. I am not a *fanatic* (I don't have a 27-foot long scarf, my mom would never knit one anyway :) )Now you have a picture of a HUGE fan of Doctor Who. Still am!Let's turn forward to 2005 and the new series.I was ROCKED when I watched the first episode. Yes, gone are all the hokey effects, the ""clamps and bits of wire"" and the sometimes entirely passable acting and rubber suits.Christopher Eccelston brings the Doctor to the new series and he is absolutely FANTASTIC (yes, one of his favorite sayings!). Billie Piper ROCKS as Rose. She is one of the best companion characters I have seen.And Russell... well, what can I say. He gets my vote as almost on level with Sydney Newman (he created Doctor Who, in case you didn't know) with just about a genius in regard to the way he resurrected a series, gave it a new flair and set it on the road to success. I will never question him for what he has done to bring back my all-time favorite series.OK... now a few notes about the new series.'Rose' is a great opening episode.I found 'The Unquiet Dead' to be quite a good episode and had a nice 'Who' touch to it.'Father's Day' is good with a nice performance by Billie Piper. The interaction between the Doctor and Rose's mum is not to be missed.'Dalek' let me down a little at the end, but it was a great start, had an almost Stargate quality about it.'Bad Wolf' has a great introduction to it. ""You are now live on Channel 44,000. Please do not swear."" ""Oh, you have GOT to be kidding me.""The Slitheen episodes ""Aliens of London"" and ""World War Three"" are great. Good writing on what happens when you pop off for a jaunt in the TARDIS and leave loved ones behind. And then you find the time machine has whoops a 18 hour abscence into 12 months...This is a great television series again and I really enjoy it. I have raved about it to anyone who cared to listen.

903307,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B0009AK57Y,Haunted Flower,"[1, 1]","""Doctor Who"" the complete First Series was my first exposure to Doctor Who. Some of the episodes in this series are utterly ridiculous and silly, but the majority overall are fascinating, well written, have scary moments, funny moments, and have an emotional pull, particularly at the end of the season. The premise of ""Doctor Who"" is that there is a character called ""The Doctor"" (played by Christopher Eccleston) who is the last alien of his species and travels through space and time in a Tardis spaceship that looks like a phone booth. His Tardis is often drawn to places where important events are taking place where the Doctor can have a hand in helping solve a problem or save the world. He meets Rose Tyler (played by Billie Piper) in the first episode and invites her to go along with him on his adventures and unable to pass down such an opportunity, she joins him as a sidekick and over time becomes more of an equal.Examples of the adventures the Doctor and Rose face together include mannequins that come to life, trying to change an event in Rose's past, meeting Charles Dickens to investigate walking dead, getting stuck in reality TV, encountering the ultimate killing machines known as Daleks, and saving the world numerous times. The most ridiculous story is two episodes consisting of farting aliens that wear man suits and try to take over the world by assuming identities of high up political figures in Parliament. The most frightening story is the two episodes ""The Empty Child"" and ""The Doctor Dances"" where a wandering child with a gas mask keeps asking for his mommy and anyone he touches turns into a zombie wearing a gas mask just like him during a war. Positively eerie! Scary kids give me the creeps! The most emotional episodes are ""Father's Day"" and ""The Parting of the Ways"" where difficult choices have to be made and some characters meet their end.Bonus Features:The bonus features are about five hours spread out across five discs (not including the 13 episodes' worth of commentary) so if you wait till the end of the series as I did to watch them, you'll have to put them all in again. Three of the discs alone have trailers for the series, certain episodes, and even the storyboard for a trailer. There is an interview with Christopher Eccleston at BBC Breakfast that clearly takes place before the series has premiered because he talks about the differences between this new first series and the older series making the girl a better written character and focusing on the intelligence and psychology of the Doctor and refuses to answer if he regenerates at the end of the series and finds some of the early bad reviews painful to listen to.There are commentaries on EVERY episode that have producers, visual effects people, writers (Russell T. Davies, Mark Gatiss, Robert Shearman, Steven Moffat), and supporting actors (actor for Charles Dickens, voice of Dalek, Captain Jack, etc.). They never have Christopher Eccleston who plays Doctor Who and don't have Billie Piper who plays Rose until the last episode on commentary (which was also my favorite episode to listen to on commentary).There is a behind the scenes making of feature with Russell T. Davies that shows read-throughs, behind-the-scenes video of shooting, rewrites, and interviews with select cast and crew members. They show the effects behind the destruction of the lair in the pilot episode, Mark Gatiss has a video diary for his first episode about waking the dead for writing for ""Doctor Who"" admitting the amount of pressure he felt taking on such a big project and problem-solving plot elements out loud, and the origin of the idea for the unquiet dead from Mark Gatiss.On the second disc, the Big Ben destruction scene is deconstructed and an error is even admitted. Billie Piper goes around the set with her own camera showing the inside of the Dalek, pick up shots from Episode 4, and scenes from several other episodes. On the third disc, you can see the models of the large balloons used in ""The Empty Child"" and the challenges of making it visually fit together with footage of Rose hanging from one. On the fourth disc, ""Designing Doctor Who"" takes us through the set design of the Tardis, Satellite 5, Captain Jack's ship, and several other pivotal locations on the series. ""The Adventures of Captain Jack"" lets John Barrowman talk about his character's background and the purpose of this really handsome guy that showed up in Episode 9 being out for himself and stayed through the end of the series where he makes a stand. He also wishes Captain Jack had his own TV show (and so do I!).The fifth disc has the bonus feature documentary, ""Doctor Who Confidential"" narrated by Simon Pegg who also had a large role in ""The Long Game"" about Satellite 5 controlling all of the Earth's television programming and news. Christopher Eccleston is the ninth Doctor in all of television history, the first in the new series. It is broken up by credits for each sequence which is a little distracting, but it's a great source of background information for fans especially since it's nearly three hours long when you add in the behind-the-scenes extra about the Christmas episode for the second series.",3,Dr. Who - Reviewed by Haunted Flower,1301443200,"03 30, 2011",2011,5209,"['Doctor', 'Who', 'complete', 'First', 'Series',

All the previous Doctors have had a quirky (not to say loud and garish) mode of dress, and each had a signature accessory.  Tom Baker's scarf, for example, or Peter Davison's stalk of celery worn as a boutonniere.  Now here comes Christopher Eccleston, slim and elegant in basic black.  Where's the fun in that?That said, I thought Christopher Eccleston's doctor was wonderful--his manic persona overlaid a very real sense of haunted tragedy.

903346,A37UPPF989N4EB,B0009AK57Y,"JKO ""A Doctor Who Viewer""","[3, 4]","Just as it was inevitable that Doctor Who was finally scrapped in 1989, after a long and agonizing death spanning almost a decade, it was equally so that one day it would be revived. The format was just too flexible, exciting and productive for any TV executive to ignore for ever and finally in 2005, after one abortive attempt to get the series back on track in 1996, the Time Lord returned to BBC TV with a bang. And what a bang! Under the guidance of Russell T. Davies, one of British TV's leading creative forces, the famous show has undergone a transformation and revitalization that has made into the most successful drama of the past year.One of the problems facing any production team charged with reinventing Doctor Who was its long and distinguished history. Tampering with such an iconic format too much would be in danger of subverting the brand, but producing it in the same style and limitations of its earlier incarnations would have been a recipe of disaster. Davies and his team and have surpassed all expectations and relaunched the show for a whole new generation, while successfully maintaining all of the elements that make Doctor Who, Doctor Who! The Daleks are back, but are now more convincing and mennacing than ever before. The alien mystery of the Doctor is explored and the companion is seen to have a life outside of the TARDIS walls that gives the show an edge of reality it always lacked before.The first season of 13 forty-five minute episodes is now available on DVD, with a welter of extras and goodies spanning five discs in an impressive TARDIS designed box set. There is a commentary for every episode from numerous members of the production team and at least one member of the cast from each story. Alas, The Doctor himself, Christopher Eccleston does not appear, but you will find his assistant Rose Tyler (played by Billie Piper) popping up, as well as the two part-time companions Adam and Jack (played by Bruno Langley and John Barrowman) making contributions. Eccleston's dominant portrayal of the 900 years old Time Lord was pivotal to the successful revival of the show and it's such a shame that he severed his ties with the program so abruptly and quickly. Although it has to be said that his replacement, David Tennant is also wonderful in the role.  There are 12 accompanying behind-the-scenes mini-documentaries for each episode, although sadly, these are only 50% of what was broadcast on the BBC at the time of the episode's first airing. All of the material relating to the classic series that was included has been dropped from the DVD. There are wonderful behind the scenes looks at the amazing special effects, graphics, design etc., and some interviews with the cast and crew.Fans of the classic series have nothing to fear in this new version. It's different Doctor Who for sure, but it's a new vision of the format that works wonderfully. If only we could pretend that the 1996 TV movie with Paul McGann never happened, or indeed we could wipe out the dying years of the original series with Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy. This is Doctor Who back at its very best and this set will keep you riveted for hours of entertainment.",5,Back for good!,1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,3188,"['Just', 'was', 'inevitable', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'was', 'finally', 'scrapped', '1989', 'long', 'agonizing', 'death', 'spanning', 'almost', 'decade', 'was', 'equally', 'so', 'one', 'day', 'would', 'be', 'revived', 'format', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'flexible', 'exciting', 'productive', 'TV', 'executive', 'ignore', 'ever', 'finally', '2005', 'one', 'abortive', 'attempt', 'get', 'series', 'back', 'track', '1996', 'Time', 'Lord', 'returned', 'BBC', 'TV', 'bang', 'what', 'bang', 'guidance', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'one', 'British', 'TV', 'leading', 'creative', 'forces', 'famous', 'show', 'undergone', 'transformation', 'revitalization', 'made', 'most', 'successful', 'drama', 'past', 'year.One', 'problems', 'facing', 'production', 'team', 'charged', 'reinventing', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'was', 'long', 'distinguished', 'history', 'Tampering', 'iconic', 'format', 'too', 'much', 'would', 'be', 'danger', 'subverting', 'brand', 'producing', 'same', 'style', 'limitations', 'earlier', 'incarnations', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'recipe', 'disaster', 'Davies', 'team', 'have', 'surpassed', 'expectations', 'relaunched', 'show', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'successfully', 'maintaining', 'elements', 'make', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Daleks', 'are', 'back', 'are', 'now', 'more', 'convincing', 'mennacing', 'ever', 'alien', 'mystery', 'Doctor', 'explored', 'companion', 'seen', 'have', 'life', 'TARDIS', 'show', 'edge', 'reality', 'always', 'lacked', 'before.The', 'first', 'season', '13', 'forty-five', 'minute', 'episodes', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'welter', 'extras', 'goodies', 'spanning', 'five', 'discs', 'impressive', 'TARDIS', 'designed', 'box', 'set', 'commentary', 'episode', 'numerous', 'members', 'production', 'team', 'least', 'one', 'member', 'cast', 'story', 'Alas', 'Doctor', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'not', 'appear', 'will', 'find', 'assistant', 'Rose', 'Tyler', 'played', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'popping', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'part-time', 'companions', 'Adam', 'Jack', 'played', 'Bruno', 'Langley', 'John', 'Barrowman', 'making', 'contributions', 'Eccleston', 'dominant', 'portrayal', '900', 'years', 'old', 'Time', 'Lord', 'was', 'pivotal', 'successful', 'revival', 'show', 'such', 'shame', 'severed', 'ties', 'program', 'so', 'abruptly', 'quickly', 'be', 'said', 'replacement', 'David', 'Tennant', 'also', 'wonderful', 'role', 'are', '12', 'accompanying', 'behind-the-scenes', 'mini-documentaries', 'episode', 'sadly', 'are', 'only', '50', '%', 'what', 'was', 'broadcast', 'BBC', 'time', 'episode', 'first', 'airing', 'material', 'relating', 'classic', 'series', 'was', 'included', 'been', 'dropped', 'DVD', 'are', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'graphics', 'design', 'etc.', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew.Fans', 'classic', 'series', 'have', 'nothing', 'fear', 'new', 'version', 'different', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'sure', 'new', 'vision', 'format', 'wonderfully', 'only', 'could', 'pretend', '1996', 'TV', 'movie', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'never', 'happened', 'indeed', 'could', 'wipe', 'out', 'dying', 'years', 'original', 'series', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'back', 'very', 'best', 'set', 'will', 'keep', 'riveted', 'hours', 'entertainment']",Doctor Who: The Complete First Series

Although there are faint echoes of Tom Baker's zany and often mischievous persona, they echoes are very faint indeed.

Several years back, I remember reading a brief article in a 2005 Time magazine about the 'new' Doctor and his forthcoming return but I had no access to the series and forgot about it. Then last year I found a great deal on the the Sixth Series in Blu-ray, bought it and was blown away. Shortly thereafter, I found a similar deal on the Fifth Series in Blu-ray and was blown away. Found the Complete Specials of the 10th Doctor's closing tenure in Blu-ray and was blown away.Enough, I thought. Start at the beginning. But there weren't any Blu-ray releases. Why not? I did the research and -- duh -- found prior entries were not 'filmed' in HD. So, well, DVD was about as high def as it was going to be. Well, technically, European PAL (625 lines) has more resolution than American NTSC (525 lines) so there is a case for upverting to 1080 and releasing on Blu-ray as done partially on the Complete Specials.Broadcast image quality issues aside, this series is a solid reboot of the series! To be sure, the series has its ups and downs with most installments better than others, This series sets the stage for what follows and does it quite admirably.Following in the footsteps of Paul McGann's little known but very notable 8th Doctor, Christopher Eccleston's 9th Doctor breathes new credibility, vitality and integrity into the long-lived series.

Producer Russell T. Davies and his team of producers and writers at BBC (Wales) have wrought a veritable television masterpiece in this 27th season of ""Doctor Who"", which many already regard as one of the show's very best. In his most capable hands, Davies has successfully ""re-booted"" ""Doctor Who"" with better, more elaborate sets and special effects than before (The TARDIS' interior looks more like a Gothic cathedral's than before, owing its look more to the 1996 film than to its earlier run as a BBC television series.), without forsaking the show's unique identity that has earned ample praise and admiration from Whovians (""Doctor Who"" fans) across the globe. Davies also has to be commended for ensuring a high literary quality to this season's scripts, and for being responsible for some of the best written scripts in the show's history. However, substantial praise must be extended too to Christopher Eccleston for his vivid, most imaginative, portrayal of The Doctor that almost has no peer - with the possible exception of Tom Baker's - and Billie Piper as his young companion Rose Tyler. Christopher Eccleston's 9th Doctor may be the series' most emotionally complex; a moody, introspective ""loner"" prone to unexpected emotional outbursts, who truly finds some solace in his friendship with young Rose. He's also the very last of his kind, the sole surviving Time Lord of some distant future ""Time War"" whose very existence casts a reoccuring dark shadow across the individual episodes of this season. A season in which The Doctor meets up with Charles Dickens (Simon Callow), visits London during the Blitz in the early dark days of World War II, and is reacquainted with his deadliest adversaries; the Daleks.

In fact I wish he would have chosen to stay on for another year or two.  Two problems with the series itself: 1) most of the aliens on Platform One look like something you'd find in Star Wars, not a good thing; 2) although I like Captain Jack as a character, they could have done without the ""yag"" angle (figure it out, as I couldn't get it on here if I had spelled it properly).

I know that there was a gap between the last Dr. Who series (with Sylvester Mccoy) and the 90's movie, and another gap between the 90's movie and the new series.  I thought it was a great revival and it was good how they didn't waste time reinroducing the main themes and concepts of the series.  It has most of the elements which made the old series great plus modern special effects.  I say most of the elements because much of the new series is devoted to adventures on Earth while the older series seemed to involve more adventures on alien planets.  I kind of prefer going to alien planets more, but all of the episodes were still well written and executed.  I was also kind of put off by Captain Jack's gayness.  Fortunately they didn't show much but I didn't think it was inappropriate for something that is supposed to be a family TV show.  I also tend to think that using a big name entertainment franchise to further one's political agenda is a cheap shot.

The BBC celebrated in 2005 by bringing the show back to television for its 27th season (or as it is more consistently called: SEASON ONE)in a glossy, fast-paced enough to satisfy contemporary audiences, while still conscious of its roots. This SET contains all 13 season one episodes from the rebirth of the longest running sci-fi series in TV history. The producers clearly have a respect and understanding of the UK icon. Obviously, fans, the creators do things with the show we would do ourselves.EXTRAS:SET features the companion series DR. WHO CONFIDENTIAL, a behind the scenes show that ran concurrently providing an episode for all 13 shows supplying fun chart toping tunes to film footage, interviews and more. Set also includes commentaries by cast and crew actually worth listening to!!Doctor Who has always has a voice defined by the decade each in tune with its era and this holds true to the new Doctor Who. This Doctor is almost child-like in his enthusiasm and wonder. Featuring the Doctor as played by Christopher Eccleston (Shallow Grave, Gone in 60 Seconds), infusing the character with great intensity and humanity, while remaining mysterious and alien, along with his companion Rose played by Billie Piper, growing from an awed slacker to a seasoned space adventurer. However, the format of the show has changed to 45 min. parts, some 2 parters ending with cliffhangers, some without. Like any ""new"" series there are good episodes and not-so-good ones, the upside here is MOST of these are great episodes! The 40 year history of the series isn't squeezed into one pilot, through-out the year we get a trickle of back-story, some old, like his time/space machine looks like a police-call-box, and some new back-story, like the fact that his race, the TIMELORDS have been wiped out in a TIME WAR.The PILOT story: ""ROSE"" introduces his new companion Rose Tyler who is attacked by mannequins (or AUTONS) in the department store where she works. She meets the Doctor and the pair end up fighting to save the world. The pacing of this one, like most of the 13 new episodes, is like lightning, and the Autons have never been scarier. The TARDIS (interior) has never looked better or bigger.Next in ""THE END of the WORLD"" The Doctor offers Rose a chance to go anyplace, anytime, they end up 5 Billion years in the future above the Earth just before it ends. But someone has sabotaged the very observation satellite they're on. Not a bad episode, it shoots very high with a ""Restaurant at the End of the Universe"" motif and cinematically accomplishes it, also reveals that the Doctor is the ""Last of the Timelords.""In the episodes 4 & 5 ""ALIENS of LONDON"" & ""WORLD WAR III."" The Doctor takes Rose home (mistakenly) 12 months later. We  FINALLY learn what happens back home when a companion up and leaves with the Doctor. The pair deal with Rose's Mum, who thought she was dead, and the ex-boyfriend who has been the main suspect. But when a spaceship crashes in the Thames in an ""stunning"" sequence which sets new standards for TV effects, the whole world goes on Red Alert, and the Doctor is noticed by the Government. Contains a nice mix of CGI and latex. Also features Toshiko Sato, returning character for Dr. Who spin-off  TORCHWOOD due to broadcast for late '06.In Episode 6, ""DALEK"" Beneath the Salt Plains of Utah, the billionaire collector Henry Van Statten holds the last relic of an alien race and the one living exhibit in the museum is a....you know what. This one makes the Daleks scary (again)! One Dalek, outgunned, outnumbered, boy is mankind in trouble. This one was nominated for a 2006 HUGO Science Fiction Achievement Award for Best Dramatic Presentation Short Form category (Battlestar Galactica won it last year for the episode ""33"")In episode 8, FATHER'S DAY, The Doctor takes Rose back in time to meet her long-dead Father, but the Tylers finds themselves battling the Reapers. A truly heart-wrenching episode, loads of disturbing imagery. The interaction between the Doctor and Rose is very real, in spite of the increasing unreality of the situation(a 2006 HUGO, SCI-FI Achievement Award NOMINATION).In the 9th episode, THE EMPTY CHILD. Its London, 1941, the Blitz. A mysterious child terrorizes Homeless children in this 2 part storyline.The Empty Child story continues in The DOCTOR DANCES. The Child's plague is spreading throughout wartime London, and so is its zombie army. ""TORCHWOOD's"" main spin-off character Capt. Jack Harkness is introduced...ROSE: You used to be a Time Agent, now you're some kindof freelancer.JACK: That's a little harsh- I prefer to think of myselfas a criminal.The ""Empty Child"" and ""The Doctor Dances"" maybe one of the greatest stories in the entire history Dr. Who.(2006 HUGO, SCI-FI Achievement Award NOMINATION)In the 12th episode, BAD WOLF, the Doctor, Rose and Captain Jack have to fight for their lives on board the Game Station, in the season finale, THE PARTING of the WAYS, Rose Tyler has seen danger and wonders alongside the Doctor, but now their friendship is put to the test and the Doctor says goodbye...sort of. This 2 parter features ""Big Brother,"" & ""Weakest link"" gags as the Doctor becomes a ""flatmate"" and Rose a contestant. Also features the ""Final Battle"" of the ""Time War,"" the return of an old enemy in a battle sequence that couldn't be beat even if Dr. Who goes to the big screen!AWARDS:The 2005 series won the 2006 BROADCAST AWARD for BEST DRAMA SERIES adding to the series' successes at the National Television Awards (voted Most Popular Drama), TV Moments, and the BBC 2005 Drama Awards!

903381,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B0009AK57Y,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 2]","Having been a longtime fan of the original series, I was elated to hear that the BBC was reviving the brilliant world of ""Doctor Who.""  I became even happier when SciFi Channel picked up the series and began broadcasting it here in the US.  This wonderful boxed set contains all thirteen of the original episodes in their entirety on four discs as well as a fifth disc containing an episode-by-episode ""Doctor Who Confidential"" hosted by ""Shaun of the Dead"" star, Simon Pegg.Each episode disc includes its own special features, with commentaries for all of the stories.  The highlights include an interview with Eccleston and the making of the destruction of Big Ben.  That particular extra reveals a fun secret to fans about London's famed clock during the taping of the sequence.The tales feature classic ""Who"" enemies like the Daleks and Autons as well as hints and nods to the classic series, including a glimpse at members of UNIT.  New enemies, like the wonderfully wicked Slitheen, also add to the mythos of ""Who.""Christopher Eccleston, who comes across as very serious about his portrayal of the Doctor, plays the Timelord as an intense vigilante at times, a caring, loving friend at others, and then almost child-like when he encounters new experiences.  Loyal fans of the series have argued over who Eccleston's Doctor reminds them of the most.  Personally, I think that there's a healthy mix of Tom Baker's (#4) wonder and seriousness, William Hartnell's (#1) crankiness, and Peter Davison's (#5) sometimes emotional frailty.His companion this time around is Rose Tyler, played by Billie Piper.  She's a young Londoner fed up with her ho-hum life who jumps at the chance to go time-hopping with the Doctor.  She's a solid character who comes into her own as the series progresses.What makes this particular Doctor Who series so unique from the classic is the fact that victims, friends and enemies question the conscious of the Doctor.  Why is it that everywhere he turns up, people die?  Is he a selfish being, or a true hero?  Excellent characters like Jackie Tyler (Rose's mum) and Rose's boyfriend, the wonderful Mickey, are used as vehicles to drive these questions home.  Even the Daleks get a couple of ego-bruising shots at the Doctor.  The consequences of the actions of the Doctor and others are also addressed like they've never been looked at before in the classic series.Overall, this is an excellent revival of the classic series.  Gone are the wobbly sets and cheesy costumes, but the intelligent stories, scary enemies, and wonder and amazement are well-intact.  If you're new to the series, this is an excellent introduction.  If you're an old fan, you've probably already made up your mind about the show.Highly recommended.",5,"To Quote The Doctor, ""Fantastic!""",1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,2753,"['Having', 'been', 'longtime', 'fan', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'elated', 'hear', 'BBC', 'was', 'reviving', 'brilliant', 'world', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'became', 'even', 'happier', 'when', 'SciFi', 'Channel', 'picked', 'up', 'series', 'began', 'broadcasting', 'here', 'US', 'wonderful', 'boxed', 'set', 'thirteen', 'original', 'episodes', 'entirety', 'four', 'discs', 'as', 'well', 'fifth', 'disc', 'containing', 'episode-by-episode', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Confidential', 'hosted', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'star', 'Simon', 'Pegg.Each', 'episode', 'disc', 'own', 'special', 'features', 'commentaries', 'stories', 'highlights', 'include', 'interview', 'Eccleston', 'making', 'destruction', 'Big', 'Ben', 'particular', 'extra', 'reveals', 'fun', 'secret', 'fans', 'London', 'famed', 'clock', 'taping', 'sequence.The', 'tales', 'feature', 'classic', 'Who', 'enemies', 'Daleks', 'Autons', 'as', 'well', 'hints', 'nods', 'classic', 'series', 'including', 'glimpse', 'members', 'UNIT', 'New', 'enemies', 'wonderfully', 'wicked', 'Slitheen', 'also', 'add', 'mythos', 'Who', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'who', 'very', 'serious', 'portrayal', 'Doctor', 'Timelord', 'intense', 'vigilante', 'times', 'caring', 'loving', 'friend', 'others', 'then', 'almost', 'child-like', 'when', 'new', 'experiences', 'Loyal', 'fans', 'series', 'have', 'argued', 'who', 'Eccleston', 'Doctor', 'most', 'Personally', 'think', 'healthy', 'mix', 'Tom', 'Baker', '4', 'wonder', 'seriousness', 'William', 'Hartnell', '1', 'crankiness', 'Peter', 'Davison', '5', 'sometimes', 'emotional', 'frailty.His', 'companion', 'time', 'around', 'Rose', 'Tyler', 'played', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'young', 'Londoner', 'fed', 'up', 'ho-hum', 'life', 'who', 'chance', 'go', 'time-hopping', 'Doctor', 'solid', 'character', 'who', 'own', 'series', 'particular', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'series', 'so', 'unique', 'classic', 'fact', 'victims', 'friends', 'enemies', 'question', 'conscious', 'Doctor', 'Why', 'everywhere', 'up', 'people', 'die', 'selfish', 'being', 'true', 'hero', 'Excellent', 'characters', 'Jackie', 'Tyler', 'Rose', 'mum', 'Rose', 'boyfriend', 'wonderful', 'Mickey', 'are', 'used', 'vehicles', 'drive', 'questions', 'home', 'Even', 'Daleks', 'get', 'couple', 'ego-bruising', 'shots', 'Doctor', 'consequences', 'actions', 'Doctor', 'others', 'are', 'also', 'addressed', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'looked', 'before', 'classic', 'series.Overall', 'excellent', 'revival', 'classic', 'series', 'Gone', 'are', 'wobbly', 'sets', 'cheesy', 'costumes', 'intelligent', 'stories', 'scary', 'enemies', 'wonder', 'amazement', 'are', 'well-intact', ""'re"", 'new', 'series', 'excellent', 'introduction', ""'re"", 'old', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'already', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'show.Highly', 'recommended']",Doctor Who: The Complete First Series

Chris Eccleston is mesmerizing, and Billie Piper is great as the audience surrogate in this reimagining of Doctor Who.  Each episode in this series is imaginative and funny, taking a character well known in British pop culture and continuing his story in the 2000s for a new generation.  Remember, though, that this series was made in 2005 on a TV budget.  The CGI isn't the best though it's infinitely better than the very cheap model work and compositing done on the original show.  The cameras used to film this weren't great either which gives a grainy, murky texture to darker scenes.This DVD set is a great way to own all of Eccleston's episodes.

Swanson,"[1, 2]","4.4 starsI am no DW fanatic; I saw plenty of the old ones as a kid on BBC, and enjoyed them in the same way I liked Trek: very interesting ideas married to laughable special effects. But I never went out of my way to watch them. So when I saw this set at my library, I picked it up expecting to watch a couple episodes and maybe have a good laugh.Instead, I found one of the best tv series, sci fi or otherwise, I've seen since Deadwood, Arrested Development and The Sopranos. The scripts are tight, the concepts often very clever and even politically relevant, and both the principals quite engaging. I truly like Ecclestone in this role, even more than Baker. He underplays it wisely, and his interplay with the quite lovely Piper is much more advanced than in the old series.The first episode is very fine indeed, and pulled me in immediately. Davis is an excellent director and writer as well; his set-ups are tight, the camera work inventive and playful, and in general this is just top quality stuff, recommended even for those not in love with the genre. Davis grasps the inherent silliness of the series' premise, and plays to it with much daffy humor, but also recognizes the potential for making statements about modern-day Britain, and gets off some good ones.The extras are excellent; plenty of them, and most are well done. Exemplary, in fact.But, the price is waaay too high. This should go for 35 or 40, not 65, but I guess they know they have a captive market; Whovians are second only to Trekkies in fanaticism, and have no doubt happily bought this set in droves.

903402,A3TRXPRUYVOLSM,B0009AK57Y,Little Roy Blue,"[10, 14]","Like many ardent Doctor Who fans, I spent much of the 1990s wondering if the BBC would ever get around to producing new episodes of its signature science fiction program. Well, I should've heeded that old cliche, ""be careful what you wish for,"" because the Beeb did start making Doctor Who again and I ended up sorta hating it.To start, I should try to explain the ... ah ... strange appeal of the classic series. Despite being filmed on the cheap and in a rush, the original Doctor Who generated a lot of witty and engaging episodes, which hold up well for those of us who can tolerate (or even enjoy) camp. To me, the show was always at its best when it was cerebral (e.g., The Aztecs, City Death, Snakedance) while the ""action"" or ""scary"" episodes were much overrated by fans (see Earthshock, or almost any of the Troughton Doctor's kiddie-oriented monster episodes).Alas, this revival series can't really be described as ""witty"" or ""cerebral""; indeed, it throws out the intelligence of the old show in favor of gloopy sentimentality and domestic drama of the soap opera variety. (Will Rose and the Doctor kiss? Or will Rose go back to her doofy ex-boyfriend? Oh, the suspense!) Now, I quite like domestic dramas, when they're well done; indeed, my favorite film director is Yasujiro Ozu, who elevated the genre to high art. But watching this season of Doctor Who, with its shrill cardboard characters (I'm thinking of Rose's mother here) and superficial conflicts, is as far from good domestic drama as Earth is from the sun. It doesn't help that every ""emotional"" moment is underlined by manipulative music, over-the-top acting, and lots of crying.On the plus side, this season had an impressive star in Christopher Eccleston, who may be the most accomplished actor to ever play the Doctor. That said, he is not the best Doctor by a long shot, because showrunner Russell T. Davies didn't use him right. Indeed, throughout this season, Eccleston veers from effective to obnoxious. His overall character - an angry man who tortures a helpless Dalek and practically taunts Rose by showing her the destruction of planet Earth - is not really that nice, or that evocative of the more charming gentleman-genius Doctor of the original series. But at times, Eccleston is a good enough actor to vault over the bad writing and make his Doctor memorable.Like the Doctor himself, the scripts here are uneven. Mark Gatiss writes an excellent episode about Charles Dickens fighting zombies, and Robert Shearman contributes a pretty good script for the Dalek episode (I'm not sure why he wants me to sympathize with the mass-murdering creature, though). Alas, showrunner Davies consistently pens the worst episodes, and uses the series as a showcase for his weird opinions on such irrelevant topics as reality TV and, of all things, weight (one of his villains is depicted as being too thin; another is too fat). Another flaw of Davies' writing is his over-reliance on silly deus ex machina resolutions; the season finale is particularly bad in this regard, as it literally ends with a god emerging from a machine and solving all the Doctor's problems for him!Finally, the production design is also hit-or-miss. British fans and TV critics tend to describe the new Who as a big-budget spectacular, but to my jaded Yankee eyes, this looks like just another cheesy BBC production. The ""redesigns"" of the TARDIS and the Daleks look little better than the originals, the opening credits resemble a screen saver, and the quality of the video footage is poor (the actors' skin tones look orange!) The CGI special effects, meanwhile, improve on the special effects of the original series (anything would) but are still mediocre; I, for one, prefer older Who special effects, which are quite funny when approached with the right attitude. As for the Slitheen, they easily rate among the stupidest-looking Doctor Who monsters in history, and they appear in no less than three episodes of this season. I'll take the Destroyer or the Zygons over them any day...In short, I was disappointed by this revival of Who, and I'm afraid that the show only got worse with time (with the exception of season four, which managed to produce a few good episodes, like ""Midnight""). As for the DVD package itself - well, these episodes weren't filmed in high definition, so they already look a bit dated and rubbish. And the special features mostly consist of the production team congratulating itself for its own cleverness. I prefer more honest, retrospective features to this kind of self-praising stuff.Anyway, while this isn't exactly *terrible* science fiction, it is overrated, and I'd give it a miss in favor of (a) modern sci-fi that's better written, or (b) older sci-fi that's funnier and more soulful.

So having completed Children of Earth and waiting for the next series to hit DVD, we checked it out.THE SERIESIt seemed campy to me, and I didn't love the characters when I first met them, but it didn't take long to warm to them.  By the end, I loved them and respected them both deeply in important ways: they had depth and character beyond many characters on other shows, even to a greater extent I think than on Torchwood, but of course there are two main characters here, so there is more time to explore them.  The Doctor and Rose both have a lot of heart and care a lot for each other - more as the story goes on - though Rose shows it from the beginning, and The Doctor opens up more as it goes on.  The characters are also intelligent, as are the stories.Like Torchwood, stories are unusual for science fiction, if you would even call it that.  I won't say there are NO space ships or that nothing blows up, and there is one scene that reminded me of a Hollywood action event, but these things are not the point.  The point is the stories, the drama, the PEOPLE.  The people make this show worth watching.  The events in the stories are mysterious, but in general there is usually something human - or something unusually alien - behind events and characters.There are a couple of stories that are complex enough that they had to span two episode to get fleshed out and resolved.  One in particular is one of the highlights of the series IMO.It is and is not violent.  When it is violent, it is not in the usual way.  A lot of people, or aliens, do die in the course of events.  ""Death follows Dr. Who"" is one of the slogans, and it's true, though it is generally as a result of problems he is trying to solve (that is, people are killed by aliens) or a sacrifice in the solution (people or aliens must die to solve the problem).  He tends not to kill directly so much as let it happen when it must.TORCHWOOD COMPARISON AND OVERLAPUnlike Torchwood, there is very little sexual tension in the stories.  I would not say none by any means, particularly when Captain Jack makes his appearance; after all, he's kind of an omnisexual guy.  But this series IS suitable for a younger audience than Torchwood, which has implied sex, and some a bit more than that.It was really fun to meet the cast of Torchwood, as we half-expected to do.  We knew we would meet Jack, though I thought it would be much later.  There were two other central cast characters from Torchwood who made single-episode appearances, though in different (yet somewhat similar) roles; I will let this be a surprise for you.  From having watched Torchwood, I know at least one more cast member will appear, and I suspect two more may show up.EXTRASLike Torchwood, there is an extra disk with 2+ hours of 12+ minute reviews of each episodes, with interviews of the actors, writers, producers, special effects people, and so on.  These are great fun after watching the series.  It really reminds me how great the series we just watched was, and provides some insight and some bits you may have missed.  Definitely recommended.BOTTOM LINEMy girlfriend is not often a fan of science fiction, but this is not the usual science fiction, and she likes this.

903419,A32BPER1JFW1AQ,B0009AK57Y,M. Aves,"[11, 15]","OK, this review is for everyone who NEVER saw the original -- because like you, neither did I.I grew up with the usual American sci-fi TV:  Star Trek, Battlestar Galatica (dicso 70's version), Lost In Space, Space 1999, X-Files.  I was even a fan of the short-lived ""Space: Above & Beyond"".  Never watched the original Dr. Who, because it just looked too campy.But when Sci-Fi channel resurrected this series, I got curious.  So I rented it via Netflix, and I gotta tell you, this is a GREAT sci-fi series!It's a little PG, so for those looking for something edgy with intrigue and gore, this won't be for you.  The CGI, not exactly top form, but pretty darned good when compared with what's out there.  The series has a feel that's a little bit Monty Python, a little bit ""Hitchhiker's Guide"", and a little bit...well I can't figure out the other bit, but its very good.The new Dr., played by Christpher Eccleston, is a very likable character, and Rose Tyler (played by Billie Piper) is the UK Britney Spears only not a dumb blond.  She's got a little bit of the ""Bond Girl"" good looks, but she's no helpless female, and she helps keep the viewer anchored in the modern 21st Century mindset, which is important since there's so much jumping about throughout time and space.What really surprised me was how faithful this series was to the original.  From the theme song, to the appearence of the Tardis, to even the look of the arch villain race of Daleks, everything done here is faithful to the original series, which began in the UK back in 1963 (take that all you trekkers!).  Moreover, Dr. Who ran continuously for over 25 years on UK television, which is more than you can say for Star Trek or even the Simpsons.  When you consider how much American Television is shamelessly reinterpreted (well, ripped-off is more like it) for the US, then that alone should make you curious as to why this concept and story has endured for so very long in a culture so similar to our own.Fans of Sci-Fi who are not Star Trek/Star Wars elitists will really enjoy it, and strangely, my 10 year old daughter and I really enjoy watching it together, so for parents who want to find good family friendly TV programming that won't dull their brains will not be dissappointed by purchasing this boxed set!",5,"If you never saw Dr. Who, then u gotta check it out!!!",1158278400,"09 15, 2006",2006,2290,"['OK', 'review', 'everyone', 'who', 'NEVER', 'saw', 'original', 'did', 'I.I', 'grew', 'up', 'usual', 'American', 'sci-fi', 'TV', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Battlestar', 'Galatica', 'dicso', '70', 'version', 'Lost', 'Space', 'Space', '1999', 'X-Files', 'was', 'even', 'fan', 'short-lived', 'Space', 'Above', 'Beyond', 'Never', 'watched', 'original', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'just', 'looked', 'too', 'campy.But', 'when', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'resurrected', 'series', 'got', 'curious', 'So', 'rented', 'Netflix', 'got', 'ta', 'tell', 'GREAT', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'little', 'PG', 'so', 'looking', 'something', 'edgy', 'intrigue', 'gore', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'CGI', 'not', 'exactly', 'top', 'form', 'pretty', 'darned', 'good', 'when', 'compared', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'series', 'feel', 'little', 'bit', 'Monty', 'Python', 'little', 'bit', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'little', 'bit', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'other', 'bit', 'very', 'good.The', 'new', 'Dr.', 'played', 'Christpher', 'Eccleston', 'very', 'likable', 'character', 'Rose', 'Tyler', 'played', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'UK', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'only', 'not', 'dumb', 'blond', 'got', 'little', 'bit', 'Bond', 'Girl', 'good', 'looks', 'helpless', 'female', 'keep', 'viewer', 'anchored', 'modern', '21st', 'Century', 'mindset', 'important', 'so', 'much', 'jumping', 'time', 'space.What', 'really', 'surprised', 'was', 'how', 'faithful', 'series', 'was', 'original', 'theme', 'song', 'appearence', 'Tardis', 'even', 'look', 'arch', 'villain', 'race', 'Daleks', 'everything', 'done', 'here', 'faithful', 'original', 'series', 'began', 'UK', 'back', '1963', 'take', 'trekkers', 'Moreover', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'ran', 'continuously', '25', 'years', 'UK', 'television', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'Star', 'Trek', 'even', 'Simpsons', 'When', 'consider', 'how', 'much', 'American', 'Television', 'shamelessly', 'reinterpreted', 'well', 'ripped-off', 'more', 'US', 'then', 'alone', 'should', 'make', 'curious', 'why', 'concept', 'story', 'endured', 'so', 'very', 'long', 'culture', 'so', 'similar', 'own.Fans', 'Sci-Fi', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'Star', 'Trek/Star', 'Wars', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'strangely', '10', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'together', 'so', 'parents', 'who', 'want', 'find', 'good', 'family', 'friendly', 'TV', 'programming', 'wo', ""n't"", 'dull', 'brains', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dissappointed', 'purchasing', 'boxed', 'set']",Doctor Who: The Complete First Series

Christopher Eccleston is phenomenal as the Doctor. Witty, sarcastic, cerebral, vindictive, compassionate and ocasionally scary. I challenge anyone to watch the Dalek episodes and not be impressed by Eccleston's performance! I know Sci Fi series aren't supposed to be Shakespeare. But Eccleston transcends the genre. Billie Piper and the supporting cast are all great as well. It's great watching The Doctor and Rose's relationship intensify with each episode...I'm an American who grew up watching Tom Baker's Dr. Who on PBS. So naturally, I was skeptical about the latest incarnation of the hero. Nevertheless, all my reservations were for naught! Russell T. Davies has done a commendable job resurrecting the series.

He does get good from episode 5 onwards, but even then he's nowhere near as good as David Tennant, Matt Smith, or Tom Baker.  Still, it was worth buying.The following synopsizes come from me &/or Wikipedia.1.  Rose: The story of how a girl named Rose Tyler came to know our favorite Doctor after being attacked by mannequins.  For the triumphant return of Doctor Who to TV, this isn't very special.  It's not bad, for the most part it's good, but I hate the scene at the end where the Doctor hesitates to destroy the Nestene consciousness & Rose hesitates to help him, resulting in one of my favorite characters being fired at (I refuse to believe he died).  Apart from that it's fine though.  C+2. The End of the World: The Doctor takes Rose to see the end of the Earth in the distant future.  Better than the last one, though there was still an annoying moment of hesitation.  B3.  The Unquiet Dead: The Doctor & Rose go to Cardiff in 1869, where they meet Charles Dickens & encounter what appear to be ghosts possessing the bodies of the dead.  Now this is a great episode.  The atmosphere is good & the guy they got to play Dickens was perfect.  A-4.  Aliens of London: An alien spaceship crashes into Big Ben, drawing attention.  But it turns out to be a hoax.  It starts off good, but starts to suck somewhere around the midway mark.  C-5. World War 3:  Earth is in danger of being destroyed by the Slitheen.  When I realized this would be a 2-parter, I thought ""Oh no!  An even worse episode awaits me.""  But big surprise, this episode starts off strong & stays that way.  Not 100% perfect (Jackie Tyler annoyed me), but pretty darn close.  A6.  Dalek:  The Doctor & Rose find themselves near Salt Lake City, Utah in 2012 in an underground bunker owned by a rich collector of alien artifacts after the TARDIS is drawn off course by a signal.  The signal turns out to come from the last surviving Dalek.  This is the first perfect episode of the season.  A+7.  The Long Game:  The Doctor, Rose, and their new companion Adam travel to the year 200,000 and land on the space station Satellite 5, which controls journalism.  The Doctor finds out that ever since the satellite began broadcasting, something has held the human race's attitude and technology back, so he investigates.  I won't say anymore, because it's a great episode.  A8. Father's Day:  The Doctor takes Rose back in time to see her father before he died, but she saves his life, and the change in history could spell doom for everyone.  This is a fantastic episode.  My personal favorite of the season.  A+9.-10. The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances: I'm just going to combine both of these since my opinion of the is the same.  Chasing a metal cylinder marked as ""dangerous"" through the Time Vortex, & they land during the Blitz in World War II.  There, they face a creepy child wearing a gas mask & meet Captain Jack Harkness, a pansexual human from the 51st century.  I'm going to be honest: I hate Captain Jack.  But that's the only bad thing I have to say about this story.  A11.  Boom Town:  The Doctor, Rose, and Jack visit Cardiff to refuel the TARDIS at the rift, and Mickey meets them there. They discover that the Slitheen impersonating Margaret Blaine is now the mayor of Cardiff and capture her, suspicious of what she has done. The Doctor sees that she has created a nuclear power plant designed to open the rift and destroy Earth, and a device she would use to flee.  Rose was at her worst here, but apart from that it's good.  B+12.-13.  The Doctor, Jack & Rose wake up with amnesia on various reality television & game shows.  The Doctor & Jack escape & the Doctor realizes he's back on Satellite 5, 100 years later.  And an old enemy is waiting in the shadows to attack.  I have to admit, although 9'll never be my favorite Doctor, this is the perfect ending to the season.  A+So overall I'm satisfied with the season, but I'm not sad he was only the Doctor for one season.  David Tennant would quickly prove to be much better.  But as for where I'd rank 9, I'm not sure.  I know who my least favorite Doctor is (William Hartnell), & you know my top 3 Doctors.  My next 3 would be Jon Pertwee, Sylvester McCoy & Peter Davison, in that order.  Then it would be Patrick Troughton,  Colin Baker, & Christopher Eccleston, but I don't know what order.  I'll have to see more of 2 & 6 to find out.  I also have yet to see Paul McGann, so who knows what my ranking will be like when he comes in.",5,Doctor Who is back!

The Doctor can't seem to control the TARDIS.2. The Doctor takes offense at the suggestion that he can't control the TARDIS.3. The people from UNIT are useless.4. An enemy uses the Doctor's emotions against him.5. The Doctor thinks a companion is dead, and it's his fault.6. A companion thinks the Doctor is dead, and it's her fault.7. The Doctor is strapped to a table and tortured.8. Something pulls the TARDIS off course - not that it was going where it was supposed to, anyway.9. The Doctor makes vague passing references to famous events of the past, as if he's been there.10. The Doctor refuses to use violence.11. The Doctor becomes violent.12. The Doctor seems amused by things that aren't particularly amusing.13. The Doctor boasts of being able to go anywhere in space and time, but somehow always ends up on or around the earth.14.

Immediately, we empathize with Rose Tyler and her mundane and rather ordinary existence.

Christopher Eccleston's Doctor Who is an incredible winner (somewhat in the tradition of the 4th Dr Who, Tom Baker)!! And ALL ""Whoovians"" are totally in love with the newest companion Rose Tyler (the amazing Billie Piper is a stunning looker and a great young actress. Though I think the raw, high-spirited jungle girl Leela is still the best companion ever in my opinion and the only one whose eyes changed color. With Tegan the stewardess running a close second). What a pleasure to have another totally up-to-date incarnation of Dr Who to fascinate whole new generations of ""Whoovians"". Now we'll see Lexus', Infinitys, BMWs, Hummers, and Corvettes with stickers that say ""I Brake For Daleks"" and ""My TARDIS"". LOL. After years of watching the doctors reincarnate into new bodies, this is my first Dr Who DVD (though I own many books) and it's excellent. I bought it mainly for the behind the scenes extras and it is chock full of extras of all types.Newer CGI and the use of primary colors (a very reddish cast to the scenes at times) gives the show a whole new look, although the aliens and monsters can still be pretty 'cheesy', but we expect that. (BTW, did Mickey call Captain Jack ""cheesy""? LOL)With Dr Who, you MUST use your imagination alot. Love the upgraded 'Sonic Screw Driver'. But I hate the interior of the TARDIS, it looks too much like that one from the Fox TV 'Dr Who movie' in the 90's, which totally sucked!! But it's a minor complaint. Not every story works either, ""Aliens of London"", ""WW Three"", & ""Boomtown"" missed the mark somewhat, but the acting was still a hoot and there is no danger of ever turning off a Dr Who show!! Who knows what we might miss. ""I Do Brake For Daleks"" the darkest force in the universe, next to the Sontarans, of course. No Borg, Sith Lord, or Species 8472 would mess with the Daleks !!

At times when he would try to be funny he reminded me of the Bert Spooner character from AYBS? (same tone of voice and wide smile). The episode with the Autons, the off-Earth episodes, the WWII shows and The Unquiet Dead. The Captain Jack Harkness character.The Bad:Too many retreads/revisits--are the writers channeling the ghost of Irwin Allen here to save money?  The Slitheen looked like they were a cross between Barney and the Teletubbies.... and we had to see them TWICE!Whomever did John Barrowman's (Harkness) hair in this series needs to get a clue and do his hair in future shows as in the Stephen Sondheim ""Putting it Together"" DVD (great DVD for Barrowman fans, by the way). The combed back look does absolutely nothing for him.The Rose Tyler backstory--good grief!  Would you, with her backstory, keep coming back to see Mum and ""sort-of"" boyfriend (seemed more like a ""friends with benefits"" situation than a true relationship) when you could be off time-tripping? NO WAY! And the way she was dressed was not flattering to her at all, made her look rather overweight, in fact.  Just about all of the Earth scenes with Mum and boyfriend are worth watching perhaps once, but upon repeat viewing, you won't miss much fast forwarding through them (no offense to the actors, they had to work with the scripts they had).The price (even Amazon's current one).

As of writing I'm on the third series, and thenshow really is that addictive.It's probably obvious what the show is about now: an alien known as The Doctor takes companions with him and travels the world, dimensions, AND time with his spaceship disguised as a police call box named the TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimension In Space). Every episode is something new, but from time to old enemies, such as the Daleks, show up. Which is what is really exciting about he show; it's fresh and every episode has you excited to watch what adventure will come up now.The performances are absolutely excellent. In this season, Christopher Eccleston is fantastic and very quirky, very flamboyant as the Doctor. He has a charming personality, and he Makes the season exiting. Billie Piper as the sexy Rose Tyler is awesome too, and really fits into the role, and the acting from her mother and Noel Clarke as her boyfriend Mickey are great too. And the story of each episode is fun, twisty, keeps you hooked throughout.

I first began watching the clasic DW series in 1983, and I will admit I was rather skeptical about the prospects of bringing DW back as a regular series.  Could it possibly be as good as the original?  The fact of the matter is that Executive Producer/Head Writer Russell T. Davies and his cast and crew have put together an excellent TV program which retains many classic elements of Doctor Who, with some updating to bring the show into the twenty-first century.  Christopher Eccleston (Gone in 60 Seconds) makes an excellent Doctor, combining the wit and charm of Tom Baker with the vulnerability of Peter Davison's Doctor.  And Billie Piper is an absolute delight as Rose Tyler, the Doctor's new traveling companion.  Camille Coduri is also very good as Jackie Tyler, Rose's mom, as is Noel Clarke as Mickey, Rose's boyfriend.  My favorite episode so far has been ""Rose,"" the first episode.

Never has a series so lived up to its potential as these new episodes have done.  Right from the get-go the producers and respective episode directors have gone for a newer, gleaming, edgier look--and yet the dialogue and some recurring villains from the doctor's past keep the series simultaneously grounded in that past Doctor Who most of us grew up with, especially those of who were us weaned on the Baker and Pertwee years.  Each episode builds on itself as well.  Although Russell Davies was the primary genius behind the resurrection of Who, a good portion of the credit must also go to the onscreen chemistry of Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper.  Eccleston will grow on you so quickly that it will be all the more painful to see him depart by the end of the season.  The Rose character is a wonderful continuation from Ace, the last onscreen companion we saw (unless you are counting the TV movie that most people have pretty much disowned) the doctor with.  She is both tough and vulnerable, but on way many more levels.  These episodes are all beautifully written-watch for Rose's short speech in The End of the World episode right after the earth explodes.  The Unquiet Dead brings us a world weary Charles Dickens-our first glimpse of him just before he has to face another Christmas audience is a hoot.  The Dalek episode is stunning: there isn't much action, but the Moby Dick take on the Doctor and just about all the dialogue is positively electric, especially when the Dalek nonchalantly remarks how the Doctor would have made a good Dalek.  My personal favorite episodes are the two-part story arc of Empty Child and The Doctor Dances.  One reason is that we get introduced to Capt. Jack Harkness (supremely played by John Barryman), the most over the top and larger than life sidekick we'll probably ever get to see with the Doctor.  The other is the reason for the title of the second part--not going to tell!  When the Doctor does dance, it is perhaps the defining moment of the whole series for the whole of the 40+ years it has run.  Trust me, it's that perfect.  The Long Game is probably the creepiest episode in the series.  Those of you who saw the movie, Shaun of the Dead will see a familiar face in Simon Pegg.  Father's Day tweaks the familiar why-time-shouldn't-be-tampered-with-and-changed angle.  Boom Town has an interesting twist-the villain gets caught, but it is the Doctor who has to dispatch the justice.  Bad Wolf and Parting of the Ways bring the first season to a close by reintroducing an old enemy and a seemingly inescapable outcome.  Bad Wolf is a keen parody of the reality tv/survivor shows that have come to dominate the ratings.  Parting is almost mystical in its resolution.  Eccleston gets a nice sendoff.

903488,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0009AK57Y,Robert Moore,"[4, 4]","I was a huge fan of the old Doctor Who. For years I was an obsessive viewer of the series on WTTW, the local PBS station here in Chicago, coming the love the show through TomBaker's Fourth Doctor.  Over the years they showed all the rest of John Pertwee's Third Doctor, as well as all of Tom Baker's successors.  I loved the hokey nature of the show, the silly special effects, the long array of creepy villains, and the various weird worlds that they explored.  But for some reason when Russell T. Davies relit the series in 2005, I deliberately avoided it.  I've talked to others who were fans of the old series, and many of them have also avoided seeing the new shows.  I really can't say why I avoided watching the show, but eventually I realized that it was the only SF series of the past decade that I hadn't seen, along with its spin off TORCHWOOD.So for some reason I decided to give the new series a try.  Each year after the regular TV season has ended, I always try to watch several TV series that I had previously missed.  My first show this summer was DEADWOOD (loved it!) and my next project was to watch all of DOCTOR WHO and TORCHWOOD.  And I've really loved them!I instantly loved the combo of Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper as the Doctor and Rose Tyler.  I have only one complaint about Season One and that is that it was the only one that Eccleson did.  I really came to love David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor, but I wish that Eccleston had done an additional season or two.  Viewing Season One of the new Doctor Who in contrast with all of the other seasons, there is no question that it represented a massive improvement in the sereis in virtually every way.  There was an absolutely stunning improvement in special effects.  The sets were vastly better and the series engaged in far more location shooting than before.  The show was better acted, better written, better designed, and better photographed.  But as good as Eccleston was as the Doctor, I think the writing sharpened in future seasons.  Season One had no individual episodes as spectacular as the episodes of later seasons such as ""Blink"" and ""Midnight.""But if you are like me, a fan of the old Doctor Who who has been avoiding the new series, I encourage you to give this new one a try.  I've enjoyed the first four seasons enormously (I'm now watching the Matt Smith episodes and have to confess that I'm not loving them, but I'm going to give him a good try).  The show is absolutely a worthy successor to the longest running SF series in the history of TV.",5,Triumphant return of the Doctor,1276905600,"06 19, 2010",2010,2553,"['was', 'huge', 'fan', 'old', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'years', 'was', 'obsessive', 'viewer', 'series', 'WTTW', 'local', 'PBS', 'station', 'here', 'Chicago', 'coming', 'love', 'show', 'TomBaker', 'Fourth', 'Doctor', 'years', 'showed', 'rest', 'John', 'Pertwee', 'Third', 'Doctor', 'as', 'well', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'successors', 'loved', 'hokey', 'nature', 'show', 'silly', 'special', 'effects', 'long', 'array', 'creepy', 'villains', 'various', 'weird', 'worlds', 'explored', 'reason', 'when', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'relit', 'series', '2005', 'deliberately', 'avoided', ""'ve"", 'talked', 'others', 'who', 'were', 'fans', 'old', 'series', 'many', 'have', 'also', 'avoided', 'seeing', 'new', 'shows', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'why', 'avoided', 'watching', 'show', 'eventually', 'realized', 'was', 'only', 'SF', 'series', 'past', 'decade', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'spin', 'off', 'TORCHWOOD.So', 'reason', 'decided', 'give', 'new', 'series', 'try', 'year', 'regular', 'TV', 'season', 'ended', 'always', 'try', 'watch', 'several', 'TV', 'series', 'had', 'previously', 'missed', 'first', 'show', 'summer', 'was', 'DEADWOOD', 'loved', 'next', 'project', 'was', 'watch', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', 'TORCHWOOD', ""'ve"", 'really', 'loved', 'instantly', 'loved', 'combo', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'Doctor', 'Rose', 'Tyler', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'complaint', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'Eccleson', 'did', 'really', 'came', 'love', 'David', 'Tennant', 'Tenth', 'Doctor', 'wish', 'Eccleston', 'had', 'done', 'additional', 'season', 'two', 'Viewing', 'Season', 'One', 'new', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'contrast', 'other', 'seasons', 'question', 'represented', 'massive', 'improvement', 'sereis', 'virtually', 'way', 'was', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'improvement', 'special', 'effects', 'sets', 'were', 'vastly', 'better', 'series', 'engaged', 'far', 'more', 'location', 'shooting', 'before', 'show', 'was', 'better', 'acted', 'better', 'written', 'better', 'designed', 'better', 'photographed', 'as', 'good', 'Eccleston', 'was', 'Doctor', 'think', 'writing', 'sharpened', 'future', 'seasons', 'Season', 'One', 'had', 'individual', 'episodes', 'spectacular', 'episodes', 'later', 'seasons', 'such', 'Blink', 'Midnight', 'are', 'fan', 'old', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'who', 'been', 'avoiding', 'new', 'series', 'encourage', 'give', 'new', 'one', 'try', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'enormously', ""'m"", 'now', 'watching', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'episodes', 'have', 'confess', ""'m"", 'not', 'loving', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', 'good', 'try', 'show', 'absolutely', 'worthy', 'successor', 'longest', 'running', 'SF', 'series', 'history', 'TV']",Doctor Who: The Complete First Series

903492,AOPKC0MNK7ZPT,B0009AK57Y,Roger Williams,"[1, 1]","From a long-time Trekkie: The new series of Doctor Who takes it to a world that Doctor Who has never visited before: incredible special effects! The effects are movie-class and the ""steam punk"" effects that they used on the inside of the new TARDIS is right on target. The best part of all is that none of this has compromised any of the writing.. it is all first class by incredible writers. The production is grest, the actors are great, the stories are great, the music is great and the effects are great. There's not really anything else to ask for in a sci-fi show.As a long time Trekkie, I can say that this show easily fills the bill while there are no Treks on the air. It is witty, intelligent, romantic, action-filled and funny all at once. I was leary the first time I watched an episode of this series because I was never a fan of the old Doctor Who because of the cheap effects and low production values.. but those days are gone and Doctor Who has become a first-class sci-fi show (which we so badly need). Don't let any past preconceptions of the show stop you from watching this.. you won't regret it.The percentage of good shows that they produce (verses ""bad"" shows) is MUCH higher that NextGen. I loved NextGen, but they had some real dog episodes (Royale, anyone?). I can honestly say that, in the six seasons that Doctor Who has been back on, there has not been one episode that I simply did not like. Some are better than others, but they're all good. Rewatchability is extremely high.. there is so much to see in each episode.If you are a Trek fan, I definately think you'll like this. The doctor get's to play the Spock/Data roll, always commenting on human society from a third person point-of-view. There is that perfect mix of drama, action, humor and romance to make it play very much like a Trek ep.. although there tends to be a bit more humor than in Trek. There are some lessons (usually about humanity.. go figure), but none that are shoved in your face.. think NextGen vs TOS. There is ofter an enterage of people who make up the cast and the plots can be quite engaging. It is a serial, with each week depending on the previous (like Voyager and Enterprise). It IS interesting going from the beautiful white Enterprise to a little blue box, but I simply can't picture a Trekkie not liking this show.The biggest bonus of the DVD is the Confidentials. They are like documentries about each episode that include interviews with cast and crew.. many of the interviews quite candid. One of the biggest thing about the Confidentals is how surprised you'll be at the actual number of special effects that are in the show.. so many of them are so good that they go unnoticed.Pick this one up, watch it on streaming.. do whatever it takes. Once you start watching, you'll be hooked.",5,A must have for ANY sci-fi fan (especially Trekkies),1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,2808,"['long-time', 'Trekkie', 'new', 'series', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'world', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'never', 'visited', 'incredible', 'special', 'effects', 'effects', 'are', 'movie-class', 'steam', 'punk', 'effects', 'used', 'inside', 'new', 'TARDIS', 'right', 'target', 'best', 'part', 'none', 'compromised', 'writing..', 'first', 'class', 'incredible', 'writers', 'production', 'grest', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'stories', 'are', 'great', 'music', 'great', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'not', 'really', 'anything', 'else', 'ask', 'sci-fi', 'show.As', 'long', 'time', 'Trekkie', 'can', 'say', 'show', 'easily', 'bill', 'are', 'Treks', 'air', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'romantic', 'action-filled', 'funny', 'once', 'was', 'leary', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'episode', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'old', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'cheap', 'effects', 'low', 'production', 'values..', 'days', 'are', 'gone', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'become', 'first-class', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'so', 'badly', 'need', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'past', 'preconceptions', 'show', 'stop', 'watching', 'this..', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'it.The', 'percentage', 'good', 'shows', 'produce', 'bad', 'shows', 'MUCH', 'higher', 'NextGen', 'loved', 'NextGen', 'had', 'real', 'dog', 'episodes', 'Royale', 'anyone', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'six', 'seasons', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'been', 'back', 'not', 'been', 'one', 'episode', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'are', 'better', 'others', ""'re"", 'good', 'Rewatchability', 'extremely', 'high..', 'so', 'much', 'see', 'episode.If', 'are', 'Trek', 'fan', 'definately', 'think', ""'ll"", 'like', 'doctor', 'get', 'play', 'Spock/Data', 'roll', 'always', 'commenting', 'human', 'society', 'third', 'person', 'point-of-view', 'perfect', 'mix', 'drama', 'action', 'humor', 'romance', 'make', 'play', 'very', 'much', 'Trek', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'humor', 'Trek', 'are', 'lessons', 'usually', 'humanity..', 'go', 'figure', 'none', 'are', 'shoved', 'face..', 'think', 'NextGen', 'vs', 'TOS', 'ofter', 'enterage', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'cast', 'plots', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'engaging', 'serial', 'week', 'depending', 'previous', 'Voyager', 'Enterprise', 'interesting', 'going', 'beautiful', 'white', 'Enterprise', 'little', 'blue', 'box', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'picture', 'Trekkie', 'not', 'liking', 'show.The', 'biggest', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'Confidentials', 'are', 'documentries', 'episode', 'include', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew..', 'many', 'interviews', 'quite', 'candid', 'One', 'biggest', 'thing', 'Confidentals', 'how', 'surprised', ""'ll"", 'be', 'actual', 'number', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'show..', 'so', 'many', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'go', 'unnoticed.Pick', 'one', 'up', 'watch', 'streaming..', 'do', 'Once', 'start', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hooked']",Doctor Who: The Complete First Series

Unlike the original show, structured around serials of 4-6 episodes, the new show has whole hour-long episodes arranged in loose arcs.  Some of the basic story ideas are unoriginal, or too thin to otherwise work, but nifty scripts and an unspeakably irresistable chemistry between Christopher Eccleston & Billie Piper provide more than enough entertainment to punch a whole through the space-time continuum.  The beauty of the show is that it's pefect for old-school Whovians and those who never knew what the show was about.  The scripts rely on deft dialog to establish the premise of the show - and not the leaden expository narrative that you'd get on any of the Trek slin-offs - creating a backstory far richer than that other franchise could have boldly gone forward to imagine.In the first series, we meet the new Doctor (there are signs that this is a new regeneration) as he tours 21st century London; we also meet Rose Tyler, a working class girl who unknowingly stumbles upon an alien menace bent on world conquest.  Over the course of the first season, the Doctor will face off against new breeds of aliens and other way-out creatures in Earth present & past, with jaunts to far off worlds.  The episodes embody comedy and drama in the right measure - they compliment the original series without condescending to it; besides the main characters, the scripts work up guest characters - villains and heroes: from Charles Dickens to the Prime Minister of 21st Century England; From the London Blitz to the end of the World; from enemies we've never seen before to the appearance of...well, Whovians can figure it from there.

903506,AJ7SBFCIXPJM1,B0009AK57Y,"Scot Merideth Peirson ""Scot Peirson""","[2, 2]","Russell T. Davies had a problem in 2004.  His problem was how to restart Doctor Who, the great British science fiction television series that had died a slow death in the 1980s, primarily due to shoddy writing and stale characterizations.Then he remembered the basic rule of good-to-great science fiction.  It isn't the situations...it's the characters.  We learned this when Ronald D. Moore and David Eick reworked Battlestar Galactica.To that end, I felt that RTD really treated the four seasons he ran production more as a 52-episode story that was told in four chapters.  This First Series Set plays more as a laying of the baseline for the 21st-Century Time Lord and those around him.  Davies seems willing to lay more of the Doctor's emotions out.  There is the irreverence and stream of thought that has usually played through the character's recent history, but Davies--through Christopher Eccelston's interpretation--starts laying the Doctor bare at times.  The Ninth Doctor doesn't wear the scarf of Tom Baker, the celery boutonniere of Peter Davidson, or the straw hat of Sylvester McCoy.  Davies starts this with a subtle reminder that, in spite of his name, what The Doctor is...is a warrior.  Whether considered a soldier or superhero, Eccelston's Doctor is a black-wearing, short-haired survivor of a conflict that wiped out his planet.  He can be severe, angry, feral and snappish all in a matter of moments.  He also hurts--he's alone.This is where Davies' thought process begins to percolate around the character.  He starts in this season to introduce ""The Family of Time/Children of Time"" concept--his Companions , the cohorts who aid and support (sometimes unwillingly), and a world that goes beyond his travels in the TARDIS (Which absolutely could NEVER change from its 1950's Police Box camouflage).  In many ways it is a broader vision than what we had in the first run, and opens up new avenues for the Doctor's world.  This allows Billie Piper's Rose Tyler--the Family of Time's First Lady--to be the soul and the conscience the Doctor so desperately needs.  Piper is allowed to give a strength to Rose that we haven't seen in the Companion's roles before (Or at least since Sarah Jane Smith), and all the while look absolutely adorable.  She saves the Doctor's life twice within the first six episodes--in the premiere/return episode ""Rose"" and at the conclusion of the ""Aliens In London/World War III"" storyline.  In ""Dalek"", Rose actually challenges the Doctor AND the infamous robot enemy in a way no Companion had.If Rose is the Family of Time's First Lady, Camille Courdi's Jackie Tyler is the Queen Mother--her first meeting with the Doctor is a wonderfully hilarious moment of attempted seduction crushed--and Noel Clarke's Mickey Smith is the reluctant entrant.  Having been the boyfriend of Rose when she met the Doctor, Mickey is the one who study's the Doctor's history and realizes the danger of being around him--yet, he finds himself working with the Doctor; even saving the world from itself in ""World War III"".But the character that knocks it out of the park in Series 1 is John Barrowman's Jack Harkness.  Introduced in ""The Empty Child"", Harkness is the knight errant of the Family--born in the 51st century, Jack would seemingly prefer being a thief to his moments of heroism...that is, if he could get his mind off of getting some.  With anyone.  Or anything.  The explanation of Jack--in the 51st century, the former Time Agent comes from a time where the term ""omnisexual"" is used.  That explains Jack, short of using the term ""male ho"".While expanding the base of the people surrounding the Doctor, RTD also expands the physical world of the Doctor.  In ""The Unquiet Dead"", the Doctor and Rose travel back to 1869 and meet Charles Dickens in Cardiff, Wales.  Finding themselves in an investigation of corpses reanimating at a funeral home, the Doctor discovers the funeral home sits on a time/space rift that is capable of allowing extraterrestrials to move into this world and dimension.  That rift becomes a part of the Doctor's universe about 145 years later...but that's for another review.It is the finish to the season--the two-parter ""Bad Wolf"" and ""The Parting Of the Ways""--that set the transition from Eccelston to David Tennant, and the course for Captain Jack...but also the level of strength and devotion to The Doctor that Rose shows; a part of the four-part storyline that runs deep.This first chapter of Doctor Who's return is a fascinating watch, made all the more fascinating by the first season being Eccelston's only season as The Doctor.  Among the special features is Eccelston's BBC interview before the premier episode was shown in England, an odd moment because one realizes that Chris knows he's completed his run--leading to his mentioning of regeneration.All in all, the return of Doctor Who to television has been a wonderful view--it hasn't been reimaged as severely (Though to its benefit) the way that Battlestar Galactica was, but it comes off as a diamond long-buried, found and--thanks to Russell T. Davies--well polished...and well done.Season/Series 1--highly recommended.",5,"Doctor Who Series I--Welcome Back, Old Friend...",1247097600,"07 9, 2009",2009,5160,"['Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'had',

So lets go over what the new Dr. Who has to offer.The show originates in Britain, and with the UK sense of humor - humour as they say, the new Dr. Who offers more of a snarky personality than some may be used to. But does that make it bad, no it makes it fun. The personality of the show makes the characters relatable and more real. Its the characters and their interactions that drive the show and make it what it is.The first few episodes do include a science fiction thread that will have fans of that genre entertained, but the show doesn't revolve around the concept of SciFi, rather it focuses on the reaction to it.

And the wait was definitely worth it! Russell T. Davies, executive producer and head-writer of the show, has done a terrific job of bringing a fresh spin on the old series, retaining many of the traits and characteristics that made the original a classic, while also bringing it into the 21st Century!Christopher Eccleston proves to be a terrific choice as the Doctor, whose charm and humor are reminiscent of earlier Doctors, while he also brings more of a dark side than previous Time Lords. It's a shame that this would be his only season. Billie Piper is also excellent as the Doctor's companion, Rose Tyler. She has everything that you'd want in a companion: looks, sass, and smarts.The standout episodes of the first season include: ""Rose,"" the premiere episode; ""The Unquiet Dead,"" the show's first period piece; ""Dalek,"" which features the return of the Doctor's oldest enemy; ""The Empty Child"" and ""The Doctor Dances,"" the two-part story set in London at the height of the Blitz in 1941, and; ""Bad Wolf"" and ""The Parting of the Ways,"" the two-part season finale that not only brings the season to an exciting conclusion, but also sees the departure of Eccleston, and the entrance of David Tennant, as the Doctor.The DVD release is terrific, featuring great picture and fantastic extras. The only complaint I have is that the audio is a little off; the dialogue is buried under the sound effects and music at times.Overall, this is a fantastic return for one of Britian's greatest icons.

It had been several years since they'd stopped making new episodes of Doctor Who by the time this new incarnation of the program came out.  The 9th was my first Doctor, and succeeded in getting me ""hooked"" on Doctor Who.  Although Eccleston only did one series/season of Doctor Who, it was a good one and had some compelling stories and introduced viewers to Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) who would go on to remain the 10th Doctor's (David Tennant) companion the next series/season.  There are all sorts of fascinating adventures to be had in this year's episodes and it's the only place a person should start when watching the new Doctor Who reboot.  Starting with this year's show, someone who had never seen any Doctor Who previously would be able to feel comfortable and start learning about everything that makes Doctor Who what it is and why it's so great.  As for Eccleston's performance, I felt that he did a fine job and brought a unique persona to the role of The Doctor.  He has a buzz cut hairdo, he wears a black leather jacket, and he has both playful and serious qualities to his character.

I will give you what they did not: blatant honesty.WHO has the typical British dry humor, which I do like.  Eccleston's portrayal of the Doctor is truly masterful; it is a character you can really fall in love with.  Rose on the other hand... she is - from what I've seen - the typical British female movie star; not very pretty and a little on the heavy side.  But if you don't need beauty to enjoy a show, then this may be just the series for you.  (I'm not bothered by the lack, but my husband constantly whines about it.)What keeps this from more stars is the special effects.  Being use to Battlestar Galactica, Fire Fly and many other SF US hits, you definitely feel the lack of Hollywood special effects on this series.  It reminds me of watching old reruns of 70's SF.

This new series of Dr. Who adventures first aired in the UK in 2005 and as of this writing it is running on the Sci-Fi Channel. It is everything Doctor Who always was when at its best and has none of the problems that it had at its worst. The Doctor is still the hero who always puts others ahead of himself, saving the day in each adventure, with a bit of a humanitarian message slipped in as well. His companion in this series, Rose, is lively and fun. The stars, C. Eccleston and B. Piper, turn in good, convincing and entertaining performances, even in the show's sillier moments.Unlike many of the old adventures from the original TV series, these new stories are relatively brief and fast-paced and have none of the padding that was often prevalent in many classic Dr. Who episodes. The soap-opera pacing of classic Dr. Who is gone in favor of succinct and tightly written action adventure. If you liked Dr. Who before but often found the pace of some of the original adventures to be a problem, these new shows will be a pleasant surprise.The visual effects, while not always state-of-the-art, are much improved over the classic shows and are therefore less laughable and distracting from the story. At its core, though, Dr. Who still does not take itself too seriously, so if you're looking for some escapist fantasy fun then these shows should satisfy.This set contains 13 episodes on 5 discs, with loads of extra features including interviews, making of documentaries, storyboards, trailers and more.

903558,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0009AK57Y,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[5, 6]","The first series of the new Doctor Who arrives on DVD in the U.S. with plenty of bells and whistles. We get the 13 episodes from the first series in an excellent transfer along with a commentary track on every single episode of the show. Christopher Eccelston is excellent as the Doctor in a series of witty, fun adventures. Writer Russell T. Davies (""Queer as Folk"", ""Touching Evil"") has recreated the Doctor by capturing the best elements of previous incarnations and putting his own spin on the material.Surprisingly the best episodes in this set are not written by Davies. He's done a great job of reimagining the Doctor for the 21st century (and Eccelston does a great job of embodying him taking elements from before Tom Baker, Patrick Troughton, etc. and then molding them into his own portrayal)but the best episodes here are the two part ""The Empty Child"" and ""The Doctor Dances"". It captures the humanity, the mystery and complexity of what made the show at its best one of the finest shows on TV.The first episode of the series takes off at a breakneck pace as we meet Rose (Billie Piper) a department store worker who discovers an invasion by the department store dummies (possibly the Autons although they are never called that in the episode). The sixth episode involves the return of the Daleks. Actually it's a single Dalek as the Doctor mentions during the show that all of the Time Lords and the Daleks were destroyed with the Doctor believing he's the only survivor of their conflict. Needless to say this isn't a happy reunion between these two lone survivors bound by hatred and fear of each other. This single survivor has fallen into the hands of a greedy American  who collects alien technology in order to backwards engineer it and sell it.  There are plenty more besides that terrific episode.. The two part ""The Empty Child""/""The Doctor Dances"" also stands up well with a moving an powerful story. We also meet Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) another time traveler who shows up mysteriously during World War II in London.The transfer looks very good. For those that are super critical about such things the color is quite good and if you're a videophile you'll probably note that the resolution in some of the darker scenes isn't quite as good as it could be but the overall look of the show is quite pleasing. The audio 5.1 mix is a bit bizarre with the rear speaker mixes louded than the center (since this IS dialogue driven it would sense for the opposite to be the case) but that's pretty easily adjusted on your system. Why the BBC didn't correct this problem with the master (or Warner for that matter) is beyond me. It is a problem that supposedly existed in the first batch of releases in the UK and Canada so it's clear the same master was used here. Packaged in a fold out case with the discs laid on top of each other (the disc with the concurrent documentaries about the making of the show is strangely enough the first one you'll encounter when you open it)the packaging features the T.A.R.D.I.S. with the Doctor and Rose on a plastic holder that slips around the packaging to hold it all together.The first disc has an interview with Christopher Eccleston from BBC Breakfast where he discusses his memories of watching Doctor Who (not very many)and what attracted him to the project (writer Russel T. Davies). I do take exception to Eccleston describing ""Doctor Who"" as a show for children. Children can appreciate it (my kids love it) because of the humor and humanity but the show isn't just for children because it's a science fiction--it's for everyone capturing the best elements of drama. It's not ""The Tempest"" or ""The Godfather"" but it was never meant to be. Like ""Star Trek"" or ""Farscape"" at its best its about the quality of the drama. I think what Eccleston probably meant was that its a show that children can watch with high dramatic values. At least I hope so.""Making Doctor Who With Russell T. Davies"" features the writer in a video diary providing us behind-the-scenes footage from before the first read through of the show through to production. ""Waking the Dead"" also provides us with a video diary on the making of this episode (which features a terrific performance by Simon Callow). ""Laying Ghost: The Origin of the Unquiet Dead"" is also on the first disc along with trailers for the show and a storyboard of the trailers accompanied by the theme. We get a lot additional extras scattered throughout the set. Each disc has some extras on them related to the episodes on that disc for the most part.The overall quality of this set is quite good. I'm looking forward to the second season of the series and hope that Sci-Fi won't delay its arrival on DVD like they did this set.",5,"Outstanding first series of the ""new"" Doctor.
