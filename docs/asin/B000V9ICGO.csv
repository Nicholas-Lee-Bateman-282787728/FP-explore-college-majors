I got the Ultimate collection which was terrific so I bought the Christmas special which was colorful and lots of fun.  It is hard to imagine such Talent going into a show these days in 2007!  If you like fun and talented entertainers I highly recommend this DVD.,5,An Over-Looked Christmas Gem,1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,374,"['had', 'never', 'seen', 'Captain', 'Tennille', 'when', 'were', '76-77', 'television', 'season', 'was', 'loss', 'got', 'Ultimate', 'collection', 'was', 'bought', 'Christmas', 'special', 'was', 'colorful', 'lots', 'fun', 'hard', 'imagine', 'such', 'Talent', 'going', 'show', 'days', '2007', 'like', 'fun', 'talented', 'entertainers', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD']",Captain & Tennille: The Christmas Show

I remember my Mom and Dad tuning into the program back in the 1970s. I don't remember the Christmas special but the music was great. I don't think the ""spontaneous"" humor really suited Don Knotts. Maybe they could have used better comedy writers for the show... maybe it would have stayed on the air longer.Still, a great Christmas show and well worth watching!",4,Great musical numbers,1293235200,"12 25, 2010",2010,413,"['Captain', 'Tenille', 'were', 'great', 'musical', 'act', 'remember', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'tuning', 'program', 'back', '1970s', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Christmas', 'special', 'music', 'was', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'spontaneous', 'humor', 'really', 'suited', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Maybe', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'better', 'comedy', 'writers', 'show', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'stayed', 'air', 'longer.Still', 'great', 'Christmas', 'show', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",Captain & Tennille: The Christmas Show

1099774,A3BZSYJKZCRY03,B000V9ICGO,Retro Pixie,"[0, 0]","In 1976, the Captain & Tennille (Daryl Dragon & Toni Tennille) brought us a Christmas special filled with the kinds of gifts you might find under the tree.  Their music and particularly Tennille's spectacular, rich alto voice is that special sparkling present that stands out among all others.  And  then there are a few goofy gifts, like the comedy skits in this show, that are akin to those multi-colored socks with toes that were popular in the 70s for a millisecond.  It all makes for a lot of good Christmas fun.Guest stars are:  The Pointer Sisters, Toni Tennille's three talented sisters, Tom Bosley (Happy Days) and Don Knotts (The Andy Griffith Show).  As mentioned, the comedy skits are corny, but it is nice to see Bosley and Knotts.A few of my favorite performances are:-Tennille's performance with her sisters on ""Little Saint Nick"" (a nod to the Captain having performed with The Beach Boys).  This is outstanding with great harmony.-Tennille singing a gorgeous and touching ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" to her niece.-""O' Holy Night"" performed by Tennille, her sisters and The Pointer Sisters.  Wonderful!!Other Christmas songs include:  ""Jingle Bells,"" ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,"" ""White Christmas"" & ""March of the Wooden Soldiers.""Non-Christmas songs include:  ""Wedding Song,"" ""How Can I Be Sure"" and a fantastic number by the Pointer Sisters on the ""Count Basie Medley.""This DVD has good picture and sound quality.  As an extra, you can watch the show with Dragon & Tennille doing commentary; it's really great to listen to their comments.This special is filled with beautiful music, a couple of sentimental moments, a lot of frivolity and some gorgeous Christmas numbers.  I would have given it 5 stars if not for the comedy skits.  Still, it's worth it for the music!",4,"Full Steam Ahead To Christmas, Captain",1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,1801,"['1976', 'Captain', 'Tennille', 'Daryl', 'Dragon', 'Toni', 'Tennille', 'brought', 'Christmas', 'special', 'filled', 'kinds', 'gifts', 'might', 'find', 'tree', 'music', 'particularly', 'Tennille', 'spectacular', 'rich', 'alto', 'voice', 'special', 'sparkling', 'present', 'out', 'others', 'then', 'are', 'few', 'goofy', 'gifts', 'comedy', 'skits', 'show', 'are', 'akin', 'multi-colored', 'socks', 'toes', 'were', 'popular', '70s', 'millisecond', 'lot', 'good', 'Christmas', 'fun.Guest', 'stars', 'are', 'Pointer', 'Sisters', 'Toni', 'Tennille', 'three', 'talented', 'sisters', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'Happy', 'Days', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'mentioned', 'comedy', 'skits', 'are', 'corny', 'nice', 'see', 'Bosley', 'Knotts.A', 'few', 'favorite', 'performances', 'are', '-Tennille', 'performance', 'sisters', 'Little', 'Saint', 'Nick', 'nod', 'Captain', 'having', 'performed', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'outstanding', 'great', 'harmony.-Tennille', 'singing', 'gorgeous', 'touching', 'Have', 'Merry', 'Little', 'Christmas', 'niece.-', 'O', 'Holy', 'Night', 'performed', 'Tennille', 'sisters', 'Pointer', 'Sisters', 'Wonderful', 'Other', 'Christmas', 'songs', 'include', 'Jingle', 'Bells', 'God', 'Rest', 'Ye', 'Merry', 'Gentlemen', 'White', 'Christmas', 'March', 'Wooden', 'Soldiers', 'Non-Christmas', 'songs', 'include', 'Wedding', 'Song', 'How', 'Can', 'Be', 'Sure', 'fantastic', 'number', 'Pointer', 'Sisters', 'Count', 'Basie', 'Medley', 'DVD', 'good', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'extra', 'can', 'watch', 'show', 'Dragon', 'Tennille', 'doing', 'commentary', 'really', 'great', 'listen', 'comments.This', 'special', 'filled', 'beautiful', 'music', 'couple', 'sentimental', 'moments', 'lot', 'frivolity', 'gorgeous', 'Christmas', 'numbers', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'not', 'comedy', 'skits', 'Still', 'music']",Captain & Tennille: The Christmas Show
1099775,A2MF0N72JVXDAP,B000V9ICGO,The Phantom,"[0, 0]","As far as peeking into a window of the past, this is a lot of fun--an over-the-top cheesefest from 1976. Points also for the commentary, even though the comments drop out for several sketches for some reason.It looks great and is very well-presented. There were a number of variety shows like this one on the air during this time in American TV history, but this one lasted only one season; the Captain is predictably wooden and Toni Tennille is the featured player throughout. Guest appearances by the Pointer Sisters, Don Knotts and Tom Bosley.The downside though is that, as a Christmas show, it's a little uneven. Probably half of it or more doesn't have anything to do specifically with the holiday. I like Christmas specials to be thoroughly Christamasy. Just a personal preference; I know that others though share this opinion.",3,Fair to middling,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,834,"['As', 'far', 'peeking', 'window', 'past', 'lot', 'fun', 'over-the-top', 'cheesefest', '1976', 'Points', 'also', 'commentary', 'even', 'comments', 'drop', 'out', 'several', 'sketches', 'reason.It', 'great', 'very', 'well-presented', 'were', 'number', 'variety', 'shows', 'one', 'air', 'time', 'American', 'TV', 'history', 'one', 'lasted', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'Captain', 'predictably', 'wooden', 'Toni', 'Tennille', 'featured', 'player', 'Guest', 'appearances', 'Pointer', 'Sisters', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Tom', 'Bosley.The', 'downside', 'though', 'Christmas', 'show', 'little', 'uneven', 'Probably', 'half', 'more', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'specifically', 'holiday', 'like', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'Christamasy', 'Just', 'personal', 'preference', 'know', 'others', 'share', 'opinion']",Captain & Tennille: The Christmas Show
