821492,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000228EHM,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 8]","It is embarrassing to see Hollywood have their hands so deep into a project that you can already tell how the film will end before you even finish watching the opening credits.  You could even possibly tell how the film will end, and how most of the main conflicts will be resolved, from a true Hollywood preview.  This is exactly the case with Against the Ropes.  While Meg Ryan thinks that she may be shedding her romantic-comedy skin for something a bit more roughly, what actually is demonstrated is that Ryan is willing to do any feel-good project.  There was nothing gritty or real about this film, and in fact, should be labeled as a fantasy story.  With the fading accent that Ryan produces only brings smiles to most faces, the fact that nothing truly bad happens on her road to achieving greatness in a male dominated world is pathetic.  The writer of this film, same writer as Save the Last Dance, doesn't give any honest response to Ryan on her journey to the top.  The fighter never looses a fight and Ryan is never stopped from being the best, she continually has one good thing happen to her time after time.  To me, this builds for a true-Hollywood story that promises never to change or to bring anything tempting to the screen.I honestly could picture this film as a very gritty portrait of a woman trying to compete in a man's world, but instead what was actually shown to me was this laminated piece of fake history that was promoted as the story of Jackie Kallen's life.  There was no dark seedy underbelly to this story, except for when Ryan moseys her way into the ghetto.  In quite possibly one of the most racist scenes of the film, Ryan clich&eacute;s her way into the world of this fighter that is black therefore from the streets.  I know that they were trying to build the background to where this unstoppable boxer could come from, but to me it has all been done before and better.  I thought that the filmmakers even glossed over the ghetto to bring us into this dramatic light.  It was not a believable story, and ultimately that is what hurt this picture.Outside of this laminated world created, there were just so many loose ends that were not even attempted to be closed by anyone in the film.  Tim Daly's character was the most simplistic character I have ever seen in a film causing the mere minutes he was in this film to be some of the most catastrophic and confusing ever.  Was he in love with Jackie?  Did he still hate her at the end?  What was he doing most of the time?  Then there was actor/director Charles S. Dutton who played double duty in this film and gave us nothing new with his character.  Clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, Dutton played the exact same boxing coach that has been done time and time again.  Does every boxing coach need to be gruff and large?  Apparently, when you are in Hollywood, the answer is ""yes"".  The only person that gave some decent effort in this film was Omar Epps, whose voice was completely covered by Ryan's lacking appeal.  You basically had to look at Epps during this entire film because Ryan's performance gave you splitting headaches.  This than caused several problems throughout the film, especially the ending.  What happened at the end?  I can't even count on one hand the number of questions that I had and why, oh dear me why, Hollywood created this glossed ending that resembled nothing of real life, but was destined to give the audience something to tear up about.  GET OVER YOURSELF HOLLYWOOD.  If you want to make a good movie, you must show realism, not everyone clapping at the end.  How many times in real life does this happen?  Either way, it was despicable and nothing sort of general.Overall, this film was a waste of time.  If you have seen one sporting film, you have seen Against the Ropes.  If you have seen two sporting film, then I am sorry for you.  Sport genres are my least favorite and this is yet another glowing example of why.  Cheap characters coupled by a story that seemed more like fairyland instead of reality brought this movie down quite a distance in my book.  What is even more appalling is the fact that Jackie Kallen looks nothing like Meg Ryan.  Apparently, the studios needed someone that would attract people to the film because the STORY ITSELF cannot carry on its own, so Ryan was called in to change her image and bring out the worst of the story.  I continually kept a keen eye on this movie just to see if Tom Hanks would make an appearance as her dad, possibly another boxer or just some random moment to revitalize the Ryan/Hanks appeal, but alas, it never occurred.  It would have helped the film in the long run, but instead we found clich&eacute; after clich&eacute; was the stronger approach.  I am not suggesting this film at all unless you are a die-hard Meg Ryan fan, and even then I think you will be disappointed.Grade: ** out of *****",2,Was Tom Hanks in this movie?,1112140800,"03 30,

821493,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000228EHM,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[0, 0]","I believe Meg Ryan had hopes for a Julia Roberts/""Erin Brockovich""-style career makeover as 'First Lady of Boxing' Jackie Kallen in ""Against the Ropes"", but what could have been a first-rate film biography was sabotaged by Cheryl Edwards' pedestrian script, which chose to ignore a remarkable true story in favor of overused boxing film clich&eacute;s. The opening credits say it all...the film is simply 'inspired' by Kallen's life, and not 'based' on it, and Ryan, and an exceptional cast, are sadly wasted.Making things even more disappointing is that ""Against the Ropes"" also offers the film directing debut of gifted actor Charles S. Dutton (who portrays trainer Felix Reynolds). Dutton has a real gift with actors, and an eye for staging fight scenes, but he is hamstrung by dramatic scenes that don't ring true, and a resolution that undoes what little had 'worked' in the film, previously.In the 'Making Of' feature, Cheryl Edwards goes into great detail about her many hours with Kallen, and all of the fight footage and resource materials she studied, to capture both the 'essence' of boxing and Kallen's early career, saying her decision to ignore nearly all of Kallen's actual story was made to improve the 'dramatic impact'. But what she chose to ignore were the things that truly 'defined' Kallen; she was a working mother who had already carved a niche for herself as a journalist and sports publicist before she chose to fulfill a lifelong dream to manage boxers (not a single woman working as a man's lackey, who was 'gifted' a boxer and dared into managing). Yes, she was undeniably sexy, but there was much, much more to her, and while she could be self-centered, there was always a maternal instinct in her personality (which Ryan could have played quite convincingly, had she been given a chance). Edwards' 'spin' was that Kallen was a brassy, naive, easily-manipulated clothes horse who 'talked' a better case than she could actually deliver. The real Kallen COULD deliver, and that was what made her so remarkable.The cast deserves a lot of credit, for what is watchable in the film. Besides Ryan and Dutton, Omar Epps, as Kallen's 'discovery', is simply terrific, both intimidating and sympathetic, making the most of a poorly-written role. Even better is Tony Shalhoub, playing 'against type' as Kallen's managing adversary, a loud, dangerous predator that had me remembering John Cassavetes in his prime. Shalhoub is a truly gifted actor of extraordinary range, and he nearly steals this film! While Tim Daly is wasted, as a sympathetic reporter, Joe Cortese, as Kallen's somewhat stereotypical, narrow-minded boss, and Kerry Washington, as Kallen's friend, who falls for Epps, both shine in their secondary roles.One can only hope that a better film about Jackie Kallen will be made, someday!",2,"Wonderful Cast, Done In by Clich&eacute;d Script...",1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,2819,"['believe', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'had', 'hopes', 'Julia', 'Roberts/', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', '-style', 'career', 'makeover', ""'First"", 'Lady', 'Boxing', 'Jackie', 'Kallen', 'Ropes', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'first-rate', 'film', 'biography', 'was', 'sabotaged', 'Cheryl', 'Edwards', 'pedestrian', 'script', 'chose', 'ignore', 'remarkable', 'true', 'story', 'favor', 'overused', 'boxing', 'film', 'clich', 'eacute', 'opening', 'credits', 'say', 'film', 'simply', ""'inspired"", 'Kallen', 'life', 'not', ""'based"", 'Ryan', 'exceptional', 'cast', 'are', 'sadly', 'wasted.Making', 'things', 'even', 'more', 'disappointing', 'Ropes', 'also', 'film', 'directing', 'debut', 'gifted', 'actor', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'who', 'trainer', 'Felix', 'Reynolds', 'Dutton', 'real', 'gift', 'actors', 'eye', 'staging', 'fight', 'scenes', 'hamstrung', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'resolution', 'what', 'little', 'had', ""'worked"", 'film', 'previously.In', ""'Making"", 'feature', 'Cheryl', 'Edwards', 'great', 'detail', 'many', 'hours', 'Kallen', 'fight', 'footage', 'resource', 'materials', 'studied', 'capture', ""'essence"", 'boxing', 'Kallen', 'early', 'career', 'saying', 'decision', 'ignore', 'nearly', 'Kallen', 'actual', 'story', 'was', 'made', 'improve', ""'dramatic"", 'impact', 'what', 'chose', 'ignore', 'were', 'things', 'truly', ""'defined"", 'Kallen', 'was', 'working', 'mother', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'carved', 'niche', 'herself', 'journalist', 'sports', 'publicist', 'chose', 'fulfill', 'lifelong', 'dream', 'manage', 'boxers', 'not', 'single', 'woman', 'working', 'man', 'lackey', 'who', 'was', ""'gifted"", 'boxer', 'dared', 'managing', 'Yes', 'was', 'undeniably', 'sexy', 'there', 'was', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'be', 'self-centered', 'was', 'always', 'maternal', 'instinct', 'personality', 'Ryan', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'chance', 'Edwards', ""'spin"", 'was', 'Kallen', 'was', 'brassy', 'naive', 'easily-manipulated', 'clothes', 'horse', 'who', ""'talked"", 'better', 'case', 'could', 'actually', 'deliver', 'real', 'Kallen', 'COULD', 'deliver', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'remarkable.The', 'cast', 'lot', 'credit', 'what', 'watchable', 'film', 'Ryan', 'Dutton', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'Kallen', ""'discovery"", 'simply', 'terrific', 'intimidating', 'sympathetic', 'making', 'most', 'poorly-written', 'role', 'Even', 'better', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'playing', ""'against"", 'type', 'Kallen', 'managing', 'adversary', 'loud', 'dangerous', 'predator', 'had', 'remembering', 'John', 'Cassavetes', 'prime', 'Shalhoub', 'truly', 'gifted', 'actor', 'extraordinary', 'range', 'nearly', 'film', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'wasted', 'sympathetic', 'reporter', 'Joe', 'Cortese', 'Kallen', 'somewhat', 'stereotypical', 'narrow-minded', 'boss', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'Kallen', 'friend', 'who', 'Epps', 'shine', 'secondary', 'roles.One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'better', 'film', 'Jackie', 'Kallen', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'someday']",Against the Ropes

The interest in boxing did not pass through the family genes, and as a result, I didn't find Against the Ropes to be particularly thrilling, but if you're a fan of women that take on a man's world and succeed, or just like rooting for the underdog, you will find this film to have not only redeeming value in the lessons that it teaches, but also bring a hint of a happy tear to your eye.Little Jackie Kallen (Bartusiak) has eyes only for the boxing ring where her daddy trains the best champions in the business. Believing she is worthless due to her gender, her forbids her from having any contact with his boys. But one of them, her uncle, pulls her close and reminds her to keep fighting for respect, because she is destined to ""break hearts, and kick butt."" Twenty years later, Jackie (Ryan) is the personal assistant of the most egocentric manager in the business. Her best friend Renee (Washington) encourages her to get a job with more respect attached to it than just catching the eye of ogling businessmen and fetching coffee, but it's a man's industry and not to be tackled lightly.Jackie insults the honor of a visiting manager, whose champion just staggered out of the ring. Sam LaRocha (Shalhoub) refuses to take guff from anyone, and tells her if she can do better, she's going to have to prove it. He sells her the losing champion for a dollar, but when Jackie goes to investigate his potential, she runs across Luthor Shaw (Epps) instead. A street fighting punk, Luthor isn't interested in her proposal to transform him into a respected boxer. It's only when Jackie refuses to give up that he agrees to give her a chance. They obtain the best trainer in the business, newly retired Felix (Charles S. Dutton), but not everything is flashbulbs and positive write-ups. The boxer and trainer don't exactly get along, and throwing Jackie into the spotlight will have negative repercussions as they prepare for the biggest battle of their lives.It's not to say this movie doesn't have heart behind it, because it does, and also delivers the kind of take-charge attitude that has become so popular among the empowered female crowd. I was rooting for the characters, bemoaning their mistakes, and pleased when they rose to the occasion despite the many obstacles in their path, but the movie seemed a little overlong. The casting was very good, and it even brought tears to my eyes during a triumphant pep talk in the ring, along with a profound apology for misdeeds. The story is based on the true exploits of the only female manager in the business. I'm not up on boxing history, so I don't know how true to reality it is, but Against the Ropes does have some positive things to say about going after your dreams, about rising above adversity, and more importantly, the ultimate downfall of pride. Jackie may make mistakes, but she never fails to learn from them.That being said, it's too bad that so much of the script is marred with foul language. S*** is thrown around a lot, along with mild profanities and multiple uses of the term ""wipe his/her a**."" There's a lot of brutal in the ring violence, along with a street fight or two. Jackie and her friend accidentally stumble into a drug den. Another trainer attempts to give Luthor the runs with contaminated orange juice, but Jackie switches his glass with the competitor. The disgusting results are implied but not shown. There's no sexual content, but a few suggestive remarks are made, and Jackie wears a couple of revealing outfits. By the time it was over, I was getting a little bored.

And only until years later after being pushed around and stepped all over, Jackie Kallen began her journey to gain the respect of the other men in the business. See, the top-dogs of boxing, the managers and all, say it's a &quot;man's world&quot;, but Jackie Kallen proves otherwise, as she hires Luther: a strong fighter, but weak minded man from the projects. Jackie Kallen takes Luther in to be trained by a very good friend of hers, and slowly but surely, Luther begins to become a better boxer and Jackie will soon find herself absorbing all of the attention they're about to get and will be blind to see the fact that it's her fighter who's now being walked all over. You'll just have to see how things turn out. And guess what? It may not be a romantic comedy, but there were moments throughout this movie that had me crying!I was very surprised at everyones' performances. I think the acting was really good, and that this movie had very few flaws. I love Meg Ryan as an actress, and since I've liked every other movie she's in, I figured I'd give this one a shot.

Based loosely on the true story of Jackie Callen, Meg Ryan is wonderful as a woman trying to break into the boys-club of boxing management. She grew up loving boxing and knows the sport inside out. After being mistreated and underappreciated by the men she works for in sports, she goes out on her own with a young thug named Luther (the fine Omar Epps) whom she thinks has potential. With help from some old friends of her late uncle (himself a pro boxer), she turns Luther into a winner. Along the way, the attention goes to Jackie's head and she starts to alienate those around her, including her fighter who then wants out of his contract with her.Charles S. Dutton directed and plays trainer Felix, Tony Shahloub is Jackie's main adversary and Tim Daly is a local TV reporter and her romantic interest. It is a great movie, but I think the ending is kind of abrupt, Luther wins the title fight everyone thought he wasn't ready for, then he and Jackie hug and make up...did he get out of his contract? Did she hook up with the reporter? Meanwhile, the real Jackie Callen was married with two sons when she started in the business and was from Detroit, not Cleveland. The screenwriter took quite a bit of poetic license.

821503,A2T049UQONS0OY,B000228EHM,Larry VanDeSande,"[4, 6]","Apparently since her failed romance with Russell Crowe during filming of the 2000 film ""Proof of Life"", Meg Ryan has cultivated a bad girl image. She tried with limited success to show her bad girl side in a lot of simlulated sex scenes in the 2003 flop ""In The Cut"". I think she has more success in the transition here playing real life boxing manager Jackie Kallen.While the film parallels some of Kallen's activiites, ""Against The Ropes"" is clearly a Hollyoodized view of the boxing game and its regime. Ryan, as Kallen, finds a nobody in a local gym and turns him into a champion, all the time working against the good old boys network to get venues for her burgeoning champ -- who leaves her at the end to work for her enemy. Fortunately everything works out in the end and everyone is happy. The script at the end notes Kallen's real life achievements.I think Ryan is much closer to achieving the second dimension of her image here than in that other movie. She dresses great all the time with trashy outfits that show off her curves. She baits men with her figure and uses it to get what she wants -- just like women do in real life. She isn't nearly as tough as Kallen  but her character exhibits a sticktoittiveness that demonstrates the resolve of the real life manager.My wife has recently taken boxing training, not to become a puncher but to keep in good shape. She works out twice a week in a gritty urban gym and hangs out with trainers and boxing managers that think their new kid is a rising star. She enjoyed this flick and saw some of life's realities in the workup to the boxing scenes.I'd recommend this DVD to anyone that wants to see an entertaining sports management movie or anyone that wants to see Meg Ryan's development as an R-rated actress. You won't see anything as graphic as ""Raging Bull"" or as poetic as ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" herein.

For the past 25 years, she's been a very successful manager of boxers. She's a tough and attractive woman with a good business head on her shoulders.  She's also quite a ""babe"".  ""Against the Ropes"", starring Meg Ryan is her story.  Or, as is explained in the extras on the DVD, it's a part of her story.  It's a good fast-paced script.  And fun to watch.Meg Ryan looks great and it's a pleasure to watch her strut around in her many excellent form-fitting outfits.  In the story, she starts out as a secretary for a boxing promoter.  She's a feisty type and, because she challenges a mob boss, winds up buying a losing fighter's contract for the mere sum of $1.00.  He's not the fighter she wants to manage, however, and soon discovers Luther Shaw, played by Omar Epps.  She convinces him that she can manager his career and hires a trainer for him.  Eventually she loses her job and has to hock her jewelry, but she perseveres and, in spite of conflict between them, she is acknowledged by all, even the mob boss.The real Jackie Kallen was never a secretary, however. She was a journalist who covered the boxing world.  There are other inconsistencies about the real woman and the story.  In the story, Jackie Kallen is single.  There is not even a boyfriend mentioned.  However, if you go to the real Jackie Kallen's website, you'll discover that she has two grown sons and two grandchildren.  Somehow I think that makes even a better story, but the scriptwriter chose to focus instead on the boxing world.  I do understand that.  When you make a film, someone has to make choices.The film takes the viewer into the gritty world of the Detroit slums.  Meg Ryan stands out in her skimpy and colorful outfits of course.  But, perhaps because of her strong personality (or the fantasy of Hollywood), she can go anywhere she wants without any fear of being molested.  Actually, all of this added to the enjoyment of the film. The acting is so good and the story moves along so well, that it all seemed believable.",4,The gritty world of boxing glamorized.

Or what was she thinking constantly matching Bronco McKart up against Ronald ""Winky"" Wright? McCart went 0-for-3 in his feud with Wright.

Having said that, I liked it well enough...maybe not in a ""I need to buy this DVD"" kind of way, but it makes for a decent rainy day viewing, or maybe as a non-threatening date flick to check out.

821513,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000228EHM,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 5]","*1/2 Though ostensibly based on a true story, ""Against the Ropes"" is pure movie hokum from start to finish.Jackie Kallen made a name for herself as one of the few successful female managers in the history of professional boxing.  In the movie's prologue, we meet Jackie as a young girl so obsessed with the sport that she spends her off hours at the gym helping her dad train her uncle, a fighter who died very early in his career.  Years later, Jackie, on a dare, agrees to manage her own player - if only she can find a talent who will be willing to put his life and his career in the hands of an untried but determined woman.  She alights on Luther Shaw, a drug-dealer-with-a-heart-of-gold whom she picks up in the nearby projects.  Luther is, for the most part, a fictional character, a composite, we're told, of several of the fighters Kallen led to victory in the ring.Regardless of how much of this is fiction or nonfiction, ""Against the Ropes"" fails to generate any heat either as a character study or as a human drama.  We're supposed to find all this interesting simply because Kallen is an attractive woman trying to prove herself in a man's world.  Yet, the story is hackneyed, the dialogue corny, the characters and their conflicts trite and underdeveloped.  The Cheryl Edwards screenplay is so sketchy and poorly articulated that we often don't understand why characters are behaving the way they are, particularly when it comes to the rough-and-tumble relationship between Jackie and Luther.  One moment they are getting along swimmingly, and the next Jackie is strutting around blowing her own horn while Luther sits pouting in the corner.  Whole episodes, which could have gone a long way towards explaining the characters' motivations, seem to have been dropped from the finished product at the last minute.Kallen is obviously a change-of-pace role for Meg Ryan who generally plays the innocent ing&eacute;nue lead in romantic comedies.  Yet, despite the fact that she is a trifle more serious here and even gets to work with an accent (the mark of any ""serious"" performer looking to buck up her credentials), the movie itself is so lacking in tension and grit and so determinedly upbeat and optimistic that it really doesn't give the actress a whole lot of opportunity to truly stretch those acting muscles.  In fact, in the final scene, the film turns into little more than a vanity production for the waning star.  Omar Epps fares a bit better, turning in a performance of strength and dignity, though the script lets him down by failing to develop his character to any appreciable extent.The one fight scene is only moderately well executed and comes way too late in the film for anyone interested in the sport to still be hanging around ringside at that point.  In fact, no one comes even close to scoring a knockout blow in ""Against the Ropes"" - not Ryan, not Epps and certainly not the audience.  ""Against the Ropes"" is a sucker punch all the way.",1,only the audience is truly against the ropes,1098489600,"10 23, 2004",2004,2972,"['*1/2', 'Though', 'ostensibly', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Ropes', 'pure', 'movie', 'hokum', 'start', 'finish.Jackie', 'Kallen', 'made', 'name', 'one', 'few', 'successful', 'female', 'managers', 'history', 'professional', 'boxing', 'movie', 'prologue', 'meet', 'Jackie', 'young', 'girl', 'so', 'obsessed', 'sport', 'off', 'hours', 'gym', 'helping', 'dad', 'train', 'uncle', 'fighter', 'who', 'died', 'very', 'early', 'career', 'Years', 'later', 'Jackie', 'dare', 'manage', 'own', 'player', 'only', 'can', 'find', 'talent', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'willing', 'put', 'life', 'career', 'hands', 'untried', 'determined', 'woman', 'Luther', 'Shaw', 'drug-dealer-with-a-heart-of-gold', 'whom', 'up', 'nearby', 'projects', 'Luther', 'most', 'part', 'fictional', 'character', 'composite', ""'re"", 'told', 'several', 'fighters', 'Kallen', 'led', 'victory', 'ring.Regardless', 'how', 'much', 'fiction', 'nonfiction', 'Ropes', 'generate', 'heat', 'character', 'study', 'human', 'drama', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'find', 'interesting', 'simply', 'Kallen', 'attractive', 'woman', 'trying', 'prove', 'man', 'world', 'story', 'hackneyed', 'dialogue', 'corny', 'characters', 'conflicts', 'trite', 'underdeveloped', 'Cheryl', 'Edwards', 'screenplay', 'so', 'sketchy', 'poorly', 'articulated', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'characters', 'are', 'behaving', 'way', 'are', 'particularly', 'when', 'rough-and-tumble', 'relationship', 'Jackie', 'Luther', 'One', 'moment', 'are', 'getting', 'along', 'swimmingly', 'next', 'Jackie', 'strutting', 'around', 'blowing', 'own', 'horn', 'Luther', 'pouting', 'corner', 'Whole', 'episodes', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'long', 'way', 'explaining', 'characters', 'motivations', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'dropped', 'finished', 'product', 'last', 'minute.Kallen', 'obviously', 'change-of-pace', 'role', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'who', 'generally', 'innocent', 'ing', 'eacute', 'nue', 'lead', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'fact', 'trifle', 'more', 'serious', 'here', 'even', 'work', 'accent', 'mark', 'serious', 'performer', 'looking', 'buck', 'up', 'credentials', 'movie', 'so', 'lacking', 'tension', 'grit', 'so', 'determinedly', 'upbeat', 'optimistic', 'really', ""n't"", 'give', 'actress', 'whole', 'lot', 'opportunity', 'truly', 'stretch', 'acting', 'muscles', 'fact', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'vanity', 'production', 'waning', 'star', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'bit', 'better', 'turning', 'performance', 'strength', 'dignity', 'script', 'down', 'failing', 'develop', 'character', 'appreciable', 'extent.The', 'one', 'fight', 'scene', 'only', 'moderately', 'well', 'executed', 'way', 'too', 'late', 'film', 'anyone', 'interested', 'sport', 'still', 'be', 'hanging', 'ringside', 'point', 'fact', 'one', 'even', 'close', 'scoring', 'knockout', 'blow', 'Ropes', 'not', 'Ryan', 'not', 'Epps', 'certainly', 'not', 'audience', 'Ropes', 'sucker', 'punch', 'way']",Against the Ropes
821514,A15MLF38WROSWU,B000228EHM,"S. M. Anderson ""sma331""","[1, 1]","One of the reasons I liked this movie was the message of you can do anything you set your mind to do regardless of the obstacles in the way.  The movie starts off in 1972 with a little girl standing by the ring watching the boxers fight.  You can see the fire in her eye, and as a little girl she really loved boxing.  Fastward to adulthood and Jackie is an Executive Assistant to Irv Able.  Boxing is her passion and working as an Executive Assistant is her way to be involved.  A night out at a party she gets into a discussion with La Rocca (Tony Shaloub) and he offers her one of his boxers for a dollar.  She is more than up for the challenge.  Problem is the boxer is a major crackhead, and has smoked away all his money.  He is in no condition to fight for anything except for finding a way to feed his sorry drug habit.Enter Luther Shaw, a drug dealer by trade, but Jackie sees something in him that she can work with.  Especially after Luther knocks out the boxer she was supposed to work with.  Luther is tough, stubborn and he thinks he knows it all.  Enter boxing trainer Felix Reynolds (Charles Dutton).  Felix takes no mess and has no problem putting Luther in his place and bringing him down a notch.  Hearing Meg Ryan say words like ""off the hook"" and ""the bomb"" in her accent was too funny too me.  I know she was playing her role, but it just came out as forced and it just did not sound right.  Omar Epps looked really good in his role.  You can tell he buffed up to play this role, and his performance was a good one.I also liked how Jackie was willing to help Luther secure a better place to live and how to manage his finances.  When Luther thanks Jackie for helping him you could see that was hard for him to do, but you could also see his vulnerability, and could sense he really appreciated Jackie for looking out for him.  Something he has not had happen for him in his life.  I thought that was a touching scene.Sammy mess with Luther's head convincing Luther that Jackie does not have his best interest in mind and that Jackie will have more of a career then he would.  Jackie in fact has gotten beside herself.  The attention is going to her head and Luther wants out of his contract with her.Shaw has to fight contender Pedro Hernandez sooner then expected.  In three weeks.  Will he be ready?  Will Luther Win or lose?  Needless to say Shaw is a huge under dog.  Jackie hands Luther over to La Rocca and realizes that was a huge mistake.  Kallen gives him a pep talk that gives him a major boost during the fight.  Jackie fades into the background, giving Luther the spotlight.  One of the funny lines was Renee (Kerry Washington) who is Jackie's best friend in the film saying, ""you call me for Black up"" when Jackie goes into a rough neighborhood.I feel the movie is worth seeing at least once.  It's not a fantastic movie, but it kept my attention.  The ending was rather abrupt.  The movie left some unanswered questions.  I really enjoyed Omar's and Dutton's performance in the film.",3,Boxing was her passion,1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,3019,"['One', 'reasons', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'message', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'set', 'mind', 'do', 'regardless', 'obstacles', 'way', 'movie', '1972', 'little', 'girl', 'standing', 'ring', 'watching', 'boxers', 'fight', 'can', 'see', 'fire', 'eye', 'little', 'girl', 'really', 'loved', 'boxing', 'Fastward', 'adulthood', 'Jackie', 'Executive', 'Assistant', 'Irv', 'Able', 'Boxing', 'passion', 'working', 'Executive', 'Assistant', 'way', 'be', 'involved', 'night', 'out', 'party', 'discussion', 'La', 'Rocca', 'Tony', 'Shaloub', 'one', 'boxers', 'dollar', 'more', 'challenge', 'Problem', 'boxer', 'major', 'crackhead', 'smoked', 'away', 'money', 'condition', 'fight', 'anything', 'finding', 'way', 'feed', 'sorry', 'drug', 'habit.Enter', 'Luther', 'Shaw', 'drug', 'dealer', 'trade', 'Jackie', 'something', 'can', 'work', 'Especially', 'Luther', 'out', 'boxer', 'was', 'supposed', 'work', 'Luther', 'tough', 'stubborn', 'Enter', 'boxing', 'trainer', 'Felix', 'Reynolds', 'Charles', 'Dutton', 'Felix', 'mess', 'problem', 'putting', 'Luther', 'place', 'bringing', 'down', 'notch', 'Hearing', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'say', 'words', 'hook', 'bomb', 'accent', 'was', 'too', 'funny', 'too', 'know', 'was', 'playing', 'role', 'just', 'came', 'out', 'forced', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'sound', 'right', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'looked', 'really', 'good', 'role', 'can', 'tell', 'buffed', 'up', 'play', 'role', 'performance', 'was', 'good', 'one.I', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'Jackie', 'was', 'willing', 'help', 'Luther', 'secure', 'better', 'place', 'live', 'how', 'manage', 'finances', 'When', 'Luther', 'thanks', 'Jackie', 'helping', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'hard', 'do', 'could', 'also', 'see', 'vulnerability', 'could', 'sense', 'really', 'appreciated', 'Jackie', 'looking', 'out', 'Something', 'not', 'had', 'happen', 'life', 'thought', 'was', 'touching', 'scene.Sammy', 'mess', 'Luther', 'head', 'convincing', 'Luther', 'Jackie', 'not', 'have', 'best', 'interest', 'mind', 'Jackie', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'career', 'then', 'would', 'Jackie', 'fact', 'gotten', 'attention', 'going', 'head', 'Luther', 'contract', 'her.Shaw', 'fight', 'contender', 'Pedro', 'Hernandez', 'sooner', 'then', 'expected', 'three', 'weeks', 'Will', 'be', 'ready', 'Will', 'Luther', 'Win', 'lose', 'Needless', 'say', 'Shaw', 'huge', 'dog', 'Jackie', 'Luther', 'La', 'Rocca', 'was', 'huge', 'mistake', 'Kallen', 'pep', 'talk', 'major', 'boost', 'fight', 'Jackie', 'background', 'giving', 'Luther', 'spotlight', 'One', 'funny', 'lines', 'was', 'Renee', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'who', 'Jackie', 'best', 'friend', 'film', 'saying', 'call', 'Black', 'up', 'when', 'Jackie', 'rough', 'neighborhood.I', 'feel', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once', 'not', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'kept', 'attention', 'ending', 'was', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'movie', 'left', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Omar', 'Dutton', 'performance', 'film']",Against the Ropes
821515,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000228EHM,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","This film is 'inspired' by the real life story of Jackie Kallen, the first sucessful female boxing manager (herself appearing as one sports reporter -- see the last one in the press conference).  Jackie is played by Meg Ryan who could be really feeling like 'against the ropes' because of these recent flops, but to do her justice, the film, or her performance itself, is not as bad as some people say.  The problem lies somewhere else -- the by-the-numbers script.OK, but the story per se is intriguing.  Jackie Kallen is doing thankless jobs like serving coffee for her insulting boss in the male-dominating world.  Provoked by another insulting promoter played by Tony Shalhaub, Jackie accepts his challenge, and takes a street-wise boy Omar Epps under her wing, to make him new champion.  She also enlists a help from the retired trainer Charles S Dutton (who also is the director of the film).Meg Ryan, often dressed in colorful and sexy clothes, and doing lower and deeper voice than she usually is, is clearly trying to look and sound like Jackie, with aggressive and foul-mouthed attitudes.  That works at first, but soon it gets obvious that she is acting ... not bad acting in itself, but still acting, or I should say, faking.  In her good films in the past (even the brief scenes in 'Top Gun') she was not faking, being always very natural.  Even that fake orgasm in 'When Harry Met Sally...' was not a fake.The major defect of 'Against the Ropes' is this -- it doesn't  look real at all.  Whatever the truths about Jackie Kallen story, the present story is made with old formulas -- initial humiliation, small success, ego-tripping act, hero/heroine's regret, then final showdown -- all of them give us the impression that the film is white-washed.  And this story is told too slowly.With Omar Epps whose biceps convince us of the character he is playing, and the long-awaited final moment which succeeds in creating the excitement of the boxing, 'Against the Ropes' ends with a great conclusion.  I wish the process coming there were constructed with some originality, or tighter direction.",3,"(In fact, 2.5) Meg Ryan is Boxing manager: So-so Bio-pic",1094169600,"09 3, 2004",2004,2104,"['film', ""'inspired"", 'real', 'life', 'story', 'Jackie', 'Kallen', 'first', 'sucessful', 'female', 'boxing', 'manager', 'appearing', 'one', 'sports', 'reporter', 'see', 'last', 'one', 'press', 'conference', 'Jackie', 'played', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'really', 'feeling', 'ropes', 'recent', 'flops', 'do', 'justice', 'film', 'performance', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'say', 'problem', 'somewhere', 'else', 'by-the-numbers', 'script.OK', 'story', 'se', 'intriguing', 'Jackie', 'Kallen', 'doing', 'thankless', 'jobs', 'serving', 'coffee', 'insulting', 'boss', 'male-dominating', 'world', 'Provoked', 'insulting', 'promoter', 'played', 'Tony', 'Shalhaub', 'Jackie', 'challenge', 'street-wise', 'boy', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'wing', 'make', 'new', 'champion', 'also', 'help', 'retired', 'trainer', 'Charles', 'S', 'Dutton', 'who', 'also', 'director', 'film', '.Meg', 'Ryan', 'often', 'dressed', 'colorful', 'sexy', 'clothes', 'doing', 'lower', 'deeper', 'voice', 'usually', 'clearly', 'trying', 'look', 'sound', 'Jackie', 'aggressive', 'foul-mouthed', 'attitudes', 'first', 'soon', 'obvious', 'acting', 'not', 'bad', 'acting', 'still', 'acting', 'should', 'say', 'faking', 'good', 'films', 'past', 'even', 'brief', 'scenes', ""'Top"", 'Gun', 'was', 'not', 'faking', 'being', 'always', 'very', 'natural', 'Even', 'fake', 'orgasm', ""'When"", 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'was', 'not', 'fake.The', 'major', 'defect', 'Ropes', ""n't"", 'look', 'real', 'truths', 'Jackie', 'Kallen', 'story', 'present', 'story', 'made', 'old', 'formulas', 'initial', 'humiliation', 'small', 'success', 'ego-tripping', 'act', 'hero/heroine', 'regret', 'then', 'final', 'showdown', 'give', 'impression', 'film', 'white-washed', 'story', 'told', 'too', 'slowly.With', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'biceps', 'convince', 'character', 'playing', 'long-awaited', 'final', 'moment', 'creating', 'excitement', 'boxing', 'Ropes', 'ends', 'great', 'conclusion', 'wish', 'process', 'coming', 'there', 'were', 'constructed', 'originality', 'tighter', 'direction']",Against the Ropes
