First Kid is witty and yet has a good message as well.  Brock Pierce plays Luke, the 13 year old son of Paul Davenport, the President of the United States.  Some would consider him a brat but the truth is he is smothered by his handlers and his life changes when Sam Simms (Sinbad) becomes his new bodyguard.  The adventures start rolling from there as sinbad give him advice on life and ladies, both having funny consequences.  He takes a genuine interest in the kid, even though no one else wants the job.  I don't want to give away the plot, but you should see this one.  It's funny.Robert Guillaume joins Sinbad with a good performance. If you like Sinbad, you'll really get a kick out of this.

426587,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6304501668,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[2, 2]","Sam Simms (Sinbad) is an unorthodox Secret Service agent.  The Secret Service assigns Agent Simms to protect the President's son, Luke Davenport (Brock Pierce of ""Might Ducks""), code named Prince.  Luke has managed to dispose of several previous Secret Service agents by driving them crazy, including Agent Woods (Timothy Busfield of ""Thirtysomething"" and ""The West Wing"").The movie tries to portray Luke as a child ignored by his famous mother and father and unable to have a normal childhood.  Though I empathize with Luke a little, he also generally acts wimpy.  However, thirteen-year-old Luke has stirrings of normality as he gains a huge crush on classmate Katie Warren (Erin Williby in her final role) and has a run-in with the class bully.  After the run-in with class bully Rob (Zachery Ty Bryan), Luke and Agent Simms begin to bond, and this movie really takes off.Much of the movie is humorous, as it was intended to be.  Most of the humor works, making this movie generally enjoyable.  Sinbad steals the show, as you might expect.  Sinbad mixes slapstick and one-liners that only occasionally clunk.  Sinbad makes Luke Davenport look good and sparks life into the plot.As with many Disney movies of this type, there are serious undertones.  The movie becomes most serious near the end when Luke Davenport runs away from the White House and encounters a life threatening situation.  Secret Service agents are in a panic as they try to locate the President's son.  Fortunately, Agent Simms, just fired from the Secret Service for aiding Luke in going to a school dance, has a way of finding Luke that only Agent Simms knows about.  The end of this movie is nicely plotted and enjoyable to watch.I enjoyed watching Sinbad in this movie.  Sinbad's comedy was generally fun, and he handles himself well.  Most of the cast did very well.  I would have replaced Luke Davenport with another actor, or would have had him perform with more confidence in school.  Luke Davenport ran rings around the Secret Service and yet he was unable to keep from embarrassing himself.  The plot was agreeable, with an action ending that provided a nice capstone to the comedy.  There is some mild violence that generated a PG rating, but this movie should be suitable for most family members down to about age 7 or 8.

Sinbad, as usual, plays it totally cool and calm in just about every movie he does. And Brock Pierce is also excellent (and cute) as the President's son - the First Kid. Brock Pierce plays Luke Davenport. Luke has trouble making friends because he's  the President's son and everybody in his high school doesn't like him especially because they think he's a snob. Zachary Ty Bryan (former &quot;Home Improvement&quot; star), plays Rob, a kid who's jealous of Luke so he starts to bully him! Sinbad plays a Secret Service Agent, Sam Simms, who's assigned to protect Luke, even though he wants to protect the President himself, and Luke is known by the Secret Service to be quite a troublemaker, even though Simms ends up teaching Luke how to face his problems and stand up for himself. A really good movie - one that everybody can enjoy and a movie nobody will find offensive in any way...no real violence, either (except maybe the &quot;harrassment&quot; from the bully and the bad guy who tries to kidnap Luke - Luke's ex-Secret Service guard who tried to hurt him and got fired because of it).

Ill tempered Agent Woods is the secret service agent in charge of Luke. Woods is fired after mistreating Luke in front of media cameras. Woods is then replaced by former boxer Sam Simms, who won a boxing title in 1977. Sam is eager to take the job-even though no one else wants it. Everyone thinks that Luke is just a brat when the only thing Luke wants is to just fit in and be like every other kid at his school, the Georgetown Academy. Sam almost gets fired when Luke gets decked at school by school bully Rob MacArthur. This is when Sam decides to use his boxing expertise to teach Luke how to fight. Luke has his eyes on classmate Katie Warren, but so does Rob. Katie agrees to go with Luke to an upcoming school dance, so Sam teaches Luke how to dance. Rob is also at the dance, but this time when Rob tries to deck Luke, Luke turns the tables and decks Rob. Sam is then fired for taking Luke to the dance without permission, although Luke had the permission of his parents, but secret service chief Morton didn't want Luke leaving the White House grounds while Luke's parents were on the campaign trail. Luke runs away anyway to meet a friend that he has been chatting on the internet with. The meeting is set to take place at a local mall,where Luke discovers that his secret friend is a now psychotic Woods, who blames Luke for his firing and wants revenge on Luke, but not if Sam can help it. This movie is supposed to focus on the kid, but Sinbad totally steals the movie, and does a terrific job.
