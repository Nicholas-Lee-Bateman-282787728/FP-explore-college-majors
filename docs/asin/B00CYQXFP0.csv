Carrie's memory abilities are fascinating to me on an intellectual level, I enjoy crime solving shows anyway, and it's a show I can show to my children.  All plusses in my book.  I will say that I liked season 1 better than season 2, simply because I found season 1 to be believable and sometimes I question things about season 2.  For example, sometimes Carrie's boss lets something she's done slide when she probably would get in trouble for her action in real life.  However that doesn't dampen my enthusiasm for the show.",5,My Favorite Show,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,561,"['Unforgettable', 'favorite', 'show', 'Carrie', 'memory', 'abilities', 'are', 'fascinating', 'intellectual', 'level', 'enjoy', 'crime', 'solving', 'anyway', 'show', 'can', 'show', 'children', 'plusses', 'book', 'will', 'say', 'liked', 'season', '1', 'better', 'season', '2', 'simply', 'found', 'season', '1', 'be', 'believable', 'sometimes', 'question', 'things', 'season', '2', 'example', 'sometimes', 'Carrie', 'boss', 'something', 'done', 'slide', 'when', 'probably', 'would', 'get', 'trouble', 'action', 'real', 'life', 'However', ""n't"", 'dampen', 'enthusiasm', 'show']",Unforgettable: Season 2

The second season was good a slight change in the cast from a basic detectives in a precinct to a select group in a major crimes unit. It is based in NYC and they all work very well together. I like this part of a police drama better the team seems to have no hidden agenda or someone behind the scenes working to plague the entire unit or undermine the rest of the team.

Poppy does an excellent job in portraying Carrie Wells. I can understand to some degree as to why they changed their local from Queens to Major Crimes.

I imagine a brain as train wreck but this detective uses her skill to see what others cannot coming closer and faster to a solution to whatever crime is being investigated.  I liked the program better when it was not in NYC - too many Law and Order vibes coming from that place - and, really, does television need another crime show in the City?  Syracuse provided a different twist and seemed more personal.  Anyway, I find the main character a bit stiff in her performance with the real time &#34;overlays&#34; examining the crime scenes a bit corny.  I continue to watch because of the concepts and not the performances with the male partner seemingly so restrained as to be without any attraction to Poppy's character at all and then, Boom, he is all over her.
