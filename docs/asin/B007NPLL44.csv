When we started watching I had moderate expectations but I knew she was looking forward to it so I continued with an open mind.  I am so glad I did.  This film is funny, poignant and creatively written and directed.  The cinematography is also wonderful.This film is based on a true stroy about a dog named RED DOG who becomes famous all over Western Australia in the 1970's.  To tell you how or why he was so famous would give away a huge part of the story.  The story is uniquely told by different members of a mining town in Western Australia, each having their own special encounter and relationship with RED DOG.The film has an authentic Australian flavor to it. The people are hardworking and have tough exteriors but inside they all have a soft spot for RED DOG.  The dog itself is lovely Australian Larrikan breed.  It has haunting eyes and a stubborn personality that fits right into the surroundings.I have to say the best part of this film is that it is a great family film, one that, no matter what age you are, you will fall in love with RED DOG, RED CAT and the crew that works the mines.

1534976,A2Z7UYG2XNLLFL,B007NPLL44,David M.,"[24, 24]","I just finished viewing the film as a rental on Netflix. Now I'm putting in an order here at Amazon for numerous copies to give as Christmas Gifts - the film is THAT exceptional. Based on true events folks, and of course there probably have been some changes made to make the film version more 'palatable' for the masses. But at the heart of the story are the very true emotions of an American man in remote 1971 Austraila who didn't choose the dog - the dog chose him. And everyone who came into the life of this dog in one way or another is touched forever, as you will be too. To be sure, there is a great deal of comedy, and very broad comedy at that. But it's very effective. Children will laugh at certain events and Adults will laugh at events the children won't probably get. Everyone will be pleased with this film. Still, with all the comedy, there is this very real dramatic vein that runs throughout, mostly from the half-way mark to the end that will enable Adults to be carried along. And let me tell you this, there will not be a dry-eye in your living room at film's end. Even now while I'm writing this and thinking back on this passage in the film, I am tearing up: 'Have YOU seen John?', 'Have YOU seen John?'.

It has everything in it for the dog lover in all of us, plus a good dose of Australian outback scenery, blue-collar values and romance too.  Just be prepared for some tear-jerker moments, as this is based on a true story and the price of life and joy is death and heartache.  I am so moved by this movie, I'm in the process right now of ordering my Blu-Ray combo so I can give the DVD away as a present and keep the Blu-Ray to enjoy the HD scenery.  And by the way, the star of the movie is Koko, who sadly passed away in December 2012, only a year after this movie was completed.  Koko did very, very well at portraying Red Dog, and this is loosely based on a true story.  There's a statue of Red Dog in the town where he often visited, as you'll see in the movie.

1534981,A1FPP34DESLHGQ,B007NPLL44,Irish Gal,"[0, 1]","If you have not seen this movie than you have to or you will regret it if you do not. This is a true story about an incredible dog that brought happiness and love into people's lives. He was a famous dog around Australia. Everyone knew him. It is a bittersweet story. It will put a smile on your face, but also it will put tears in your eyes. I am so glad I viewed this movie as it shows how much our furry kids can bring such abundance of joy into our lives. I cannot understand the negative reviews on Amazon about this movie. The negative reviewers just do not get it. It is not about romance as one negative viewer said it was suppose to be or should have been. It was about Red Dog telling us how intelligent our canine friends are, how Red Dog brought people together, and how people cared for Red Dog. Red Dog did not have one master, but many cared for him  until he found his true master 'Johnny Boy or John'. Red Dog traveled all over Australia looking for his only true master after his true master left and I won't say anything more about his master as you need to watch the movie to find out why Red Dog was searching for John. As said in the movie by Vanno(character/acting name), 'Sometimes you pick your dog and sometimes your dog picks you"". Red Dog did pick his true master. Prior to finding his true master everyone in this small town of Dampier, AU loved and cared for Red Dog. He even became part of their union where they worked for the Hamersley Iron Mining Company. Yes, this is all truth. As I say again, it is a true story. As said in the movie, ""He is a smart pooch"" and how true that statement is. Red Dog even had a fund at the town bank so that if he needed food or medical care they then would have the funds to help him. Red Dog had a loyal Veterinarian who took such good care of Red Dog when he needed it. Red Dog went through a severe grieving process after his true master was gone. Again, I will not say what happened to John (his master) as you need to watch the movie. I will try not to say anymore as it could spoil it for those who have not viewed the movie. I watched this movie on TV, and bought the movie ASAP. I knew it was not a waste of money. I still watch it repeatedly. The ending is so sweet when the town dedicates a statue in honor of Red Dog, which was erected outside the town of Dampier and is still there to this day and always will be. There was also a Red Dog puppies at the end of the movie. This movie also reminds me of the movie Hachi with Richard Gere, which is another touching movie that should be viewed by all. The only difference between Red Dog and Hachi I found was that Red Dog had a much stronger character. Red Dog had a sense of humor about him and yet a serious side. Red Dog will make you laugh at times. Oh, I must not forget to mention Red Cat who was Red Dog's rival at the start of the movie. Red Cat was a bad bad dude and Red Dog had to contend with him, but it was funny. This movie also reminds me of my American Eskimo who passed on a few weeks after she and I watched Red Dog together. I now have a new American Eskimo puppy, so it rather reminds me of the Red Dog story, as there were new Red Dog pups at the end of the movie. Again I say, just do not take my word for it. You must watch this movie. It will pull at those heartstrings. Have lots of facial tissue nearby, as you will need it. From my hours of research about Red Dog, some say seeing the movie has changed their lives for the positive and I believe it. It surely changed my life and I have been a dog lover and owner since I can remember and I am now 53-years old. However, I learned more things about our furry kids from this movie. How much they really love us unconditionally, they go all out to help us, and give us companionship. Koko who played Red Dog was an excellent actor. The true Red Dog passed away in 1979. Sadly, Koko passed on in late 2012. Koko has a Red Dog screen test on 'You Tube' that will tickle you. Just type in 'Koko's RED DOG Screen Test' or http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Su66nlzKC0, you can see him in action and how intelligent Koko was. Make sure you watch Koko's expression at the end of the video when the director tells Koko he has to have his hair dyed red because he is a Red Dog meaning he got the part after his interview with the director. Watch and you will melt at his cute little precious face. A very intelligent guy Koko was. I am sure his owner/producer of the movie misses Koko a great deal.Red Dog was a very strong dog to go through all the things he did and he never gave up hope. That is something we all can learn from is to not give up hope. I just do not know what else to say as the movie is that excellent. The movie won rave reviews in Australia and they only started out with an 8 million dollar budget. The movie grossed over 21 million dollars at the box office in just Australia alone. The actors Josh Luccas, Rachel Taylor, and all were wonderful with Koko and their acting. Koko and the producer of the movie became so attached while making the movie that the producer became Koko's true owner. All I can say it please watch it!Red Dog's website where you can see his statue and other things:  http://reddogwa.com/",5,Awesome,1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,5230,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie',

The box will lead you to believe it is a romantic comedy for dog lovers, and yeah, it's a little bit of that, but the romance is not the major focus of this film.Like another reviewer said, don't let the beginning throw you off. It takes a little while to warm up to. It's a low budget Australian film that takes place in a dirty, arid mining town in Australia populated almost entirely by dirty, unattractive men, and a dog. Sorry dog fans, but even the canine star is kind of homely and is not really called upon to do any heavy duty doggie acting. In fact, nothing in this film is attractive (well, okay, Rachael Taylor is gorgeous).For a modern, family-friendly film, the pacing is a bit slow, and the filmmaker loves to suddenly freeze-frame and throw up a caption describing the character being shown... a technique that is very off-putting to me and I was about to write off the movie after the first 15 minutes, and yet, despite what's starting to sound like a negative review, the movie works for me. As you get to know the miners and their quirky back stories (all related to Red Dog in some way) you start to pick up on an inner beauty to the story that really left me thinking about it the next day... a very good sign.This movie is suitable for all ages. A couple of bits of crude phrases (hardly worth mentioning) and apparently the couple spends the night together (not shown) on the first date, but I would have no problem sharing this with children - although they may find it a little slow as the ""magic"" of the story might be lost on them.I myself am not a huge dog fanatic, and would never recommend a film based purely on the presence of a canine character, but if you are fond of independent movies, dog-stories, or quirky characters, I would recommend this film. I have to agree with the previous reviewer that ""Hachi"" is a little more polished and heart-wrenching than Red Dog, but what's fun is that Red Dog is a very similar story told in a very different way, and with more eccentric characters.
