If you're looking for compelling archeological evidence that the Bible is authentic, you've just stumbled upon your first stop. Two great explorers obtained a lead from a friend about another location that could be the real Mt. Sinai. Whereas the previous supposed Mt. Sinai had absolutely no evidence confirming its authenticity, this new location provides all the evidence that even the most hard-nosed skeptic would want to find. It's absolutely incredible.

167409,ANYDEWJQN2GBX,0967501032,"Deepak K. Singh ""DKS""","[8, 13]","The DVD titled ""The Search for the Real Mt. Sinai"" is not the original discovery though whatever shown in it is authentic. The site was first discovered by amateur biblical archeologist Mr.Ron Wyatt who is also credited with the discovery of Noah's Ark. It was he who first entered Saudi Arabia along with his two sons without proper papers and went on to discover the site. However, he and his sons were soon arrested by the Saudi authorities on the charges of espionage for the state of Israel. They were later released by the authorities after three months when Ron Waytt was able to convince the Saudi authorities that he had found the real ""Mount Sinai"". However, the evidence they had collected was confiscated by the authorities. After the incident, the Saudi authorities converted the entire area into an archeological site and fenced the whole area fearing that the site might lead to political instability as it would attract attention from Christians and Jewish people which they probably deemed undesirable for a Muslim state. However, after some years, Ron did manage to get the videos of Mt. Sinai and its surroundings with the help of a friend. It is only after this that the biblical explorers Bob Cornuke and Larry Williams visited the site and brought the evidence. If you notice in this DVD, the archeologists Bob and Larry state that some persons had gone in Saudi before and got arrested with their videos confiscated. They were talking about Ron.If you really want to have an in-depth information of the site, I strongly recommend that you go to [...] to get the original and more authentic footage (without any recreations as in this DVD) and see for yourself. The evidence available on ""The Exodus"" DVD available at [...] is much vast and the onsite footage much detailed. The ""Search for the Real Mt. Sinai"" DVD supplements little information when compared to ""The Exodus"" DVD. However, as always is the case, the original things generally get subdued by their duplicates.Not only this, the above site also contains amazing discoveries on Noah's Ark, Exodus, Sodom & Gomorrah and Ark of the Covenant which are also available on DVDs. After viewing these DVDs, I really believe that the God had chosen Ron Wyatt to unearth all the major discoveries, as all the discoveries made by Mr.Ron Wyatt are incredible and possible only with the understanding given by the LORD. I feel priviledged and blessed to have witnessed the proof of God's mighty work in the past and also invite you to share the evidence put forth by God.",3,Go for the Original Discovery DVD instead of this one !!!,1118361600,"06 10, 2005",2005,2544,"['DVD', 'titled', 'Search', 'Real', 'Mt', 'Sinai', 'not', 'original', 'discovery', 'shown', 'authentic', 'site', 'was', 'first', 'discovered', 'amateur', 'biblical', 'archeologist', 'Mr.Ron', 'Wyatt', 'who', 'also', 'credited', 'discovery', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'was', 'who', 'first', 'entered', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'two', 'sons', 'proper', 'papers', 'went', 'discover', 'site', 'However', 'sons', 'were', 'soon', 'arrested', 'Saudi', 'authorities', 'charges', 'espionage', 'state', 'Israel', 'were', 'later', 'released', 'authorities', 'three', 'months', 'when', 'Ron', 'Waytt', 'was', 'able', 'convince', 'Saudi', 'authorities', 'had', 'found', 'real', 'Mount', 'Sinai', 'However', 'evidence', 'had', 'collected', 'was', 'confiscated', 'authorities', 'incident', 'Saudi', 'authorities', 'converted', 'entire', 'area', 'archeological', 'site', 'fenced', 'whole', 'area', 'fearing', 'site', 'might', 'lead', 'political', 'instability', 'would', 'attract', 'attention', 'Christians', 'Jewish', 'people', 'probably', 'deemed', 'undesirable', 'Muslim', 'state', 'However', 'years', 'Ron', 'did', 'manage', 'get', 'videos', 'Mt', 'Sinai', 'surroundings', 'help', 'friend', 'only', 'biblical', 'explorers', 'Bob', 'Cornuke', 'Larry', 'Williams', 'visited', 'site', 'brought', 'evidence', 'notice', 'DVD', 'archeologists', 'Bob', 'Larry', 'state', 'persons', 'had', 'gone', 'Saudi', 'got', 'arrested', 'videos', 'confiscated', 'were', 'talking', 'Ron.If', 'really', 'want', 'have', 'in-depth', 'information', 'site', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'go', '[', ']', 'get', 'original', 'more', 'authentic', 'footage', 'recreations', 'DVD', 'see', 'evidence', 'available', 'Exodus', 'DVD', 'available', '[', ']', 'much', 'vast', 'onsite', 'footage', 'much', 'detailed', 'Search', 'Real', 'Mt', 'Sinai', 'DVD', 'little', 'information', 'when', 'compared', 'Exodus', 'DVD', 'However', 'always', 'case', 'original', 'things', 'generally', 'get', 'subdued', 'duplicates.Not', 'only', 'site', 'also', 'amazing', 'discoveries', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'Exodus', 'Sodom', 'Gomorrah', 'Ark', 'Covenant', 'are', 'also', 'available', 'DVDs', 'viewing', 'DVDs', 'really', 'believe', 'God', 'had', 'chosen', 'Ron', 'Wyatt', 'unearth', 'major', 'discoveries', 'discoveries', 'made', 'Mr.Ron', 'Wyatt', 'are', 'incredible', 'possible', 'only', 'understanding', 'given', 'LORD', 'feel', 'priviledged', 'blessed', 'have', 'witnessed', 'proof', 'God', 'mighty', 'work', 'past', 'also', 'invite', 'share', 'evidence', 'put', 'forth', 'God']",The Search for the Real Mt.

167410,A3W162WZYJRMBI,0967501032,"Edward J. Vasicek ""Author, pastor, columnist""","[10, 11]","This DVD is absolutely incredible. It is the documentation (with footage and photos) of the real Mt. Sinai within Saudi Arabia. This is the real thing, not some bogus claims. The two men featured in the DVD retraced the Exodus according to the Biblical criteria, found the Red Sea crossing point, and eventually snuck into Saudi Arabia.  They continued on their journey and came to what the locals call the Mountain of Moses where they found (and filmed) the acutal altar the children of Israel constructed to worship the golden calf (with Eyptian drawings of the calf on the altar), the rock that split and evidence of there having been a large reservoir of water flowing from it (in an area that gets 1/2 inch of rain every ten years), the boundary markers Moses had set up, the remnant of the altar, and even a scorched top on the mountain!To add ""truth is stranger than fiction"" suspense, the area is fenced off and lightly guarded by the Saudi government (the political ramifications of Moses and the Israelites having been in Saudi Arabia at one time is a red hot issue).This material is an excellent source to document the Exodus and Numbers accounts.

167412,AEYEAH3C78BBZ,0967501032,Tim Challies,"[17, 26]","Many years ago Ron Wyatt, an intrepid explorer, claimed to have found the real Mount Sinai, becoming one of many men to have made this claim. But this was only one of his many claims. He also claimed to have found Noah's Ark, chariot wheels from the Red Sea, The Ark of the Covenant, the ruins of Sodom and Gomorrah, and even the hole into which Jesus' cross was placed. While Wyatt has largely been exposed as a fraud, some people continue to believe that he did find clues leading to the location of the mountain on which God gave His Law to Moses.Enter two American adventurers. Several years ago Bob Cornuke, a former police officer and Larry Williams, a commodities trader, embarked on an adventure to find the real Mount Sinai. Borrowing from Wyatt's data, and moving forward on three assumptions, they determined that a likely site for the mountain was Midian - now a part of Saudi Arabia. Their assumptions were as follows. First, that the Sinai Peninsula was considered part of the ""Land of Egypt"" and hence could not have been the location of Mt. Sinai, for the Bible clearly states that the Israelites went ""out of Egypt;"" second, that Mt. Sinai is in the Land of Midian; third, that according to Galatians 4:25, Mt. Sinai is in Saudi Arabia (""Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia""), which assumes that the Arabia of our day is the same as in Paul's day. Many scholars would take issue with each of these assumptions.With falsified documents Cornuke and Williams entered the Saudi Kingdom and began their search. The Search for the Real Mt. Sinai is a documentary on DVD that details their search. It contains both original footage recorded on their journey and dramatic recreations. What they found, if true, represents the greatest archaelogical discovery since the Dead Sea Scrolls. They claim to have found the well at Marah; the twelve springs of Elim; the caves of Moses and Jethro; the altar for the golden calf; the altar of Moses; the twelve pillars representing the twelve tribes of Israel; the blackened rock from when God came upon the mountain in fire; and the split rock of Horeb from which water flowed. They claim to have found nearly irrefutible evidence of the real Mount Sinai.The explorers believe that this is common knowledge in that part of the world, for they found that the mountain they identified as the probable Mt. Sinai is surrounded by a fence and heavily guarded by Saudi troops. Like something out of a script for Indiana Jones, they crawled past this fence in the dead of night, finding their way with night vision goggles to avoid detection. Finally they scaled the mountain and found these amazing discoveries.In short, this DVD presents a very convincing case that these men truly did find the real Mount Sinai. But as always, there are two sides of the story. While it is easy to convince ignorant laypeople like myself, experts have raised serious questions about the validities of these claims. And like most biblical issues, nobody can be neutral as every person has something to lose and something to gain.The DVD is fascinating and informative, though unfortunately there is far more recreated footage than original photos and video. The production is very good throughout - about equal to the level of quality we would expect to see on The Learning Channel or Discovery.As I wrote earlier in this review, if all that these men have found is accurate, they have made a discovery of incredible importance. Watching the DVD it is difficult to be swayed by their excitement and determination. Their adventure makes for a great story. But when reality sets in, it seems that there are many difficult questions that remain unanswered. If you are able to suspend your reason just a little bit, you'll enjoy this presentation and be swept away in the possibility that you might be seeing the very sites described in the Bible. But when the credits roll, you'll be forced to remember that we walk by faith, not by sight. Whether or not this is the biblical site matters little to our faith. If we allow our faith to be shaped by such discoveries, we will have little depth and will be easily swayed. It is ""An evil and adulterous generation [that] seeks for a sign."" But we can all enjoy a good story, even if it is just a little bit too good to be true.",3,Too Good to be True?,1119744000,"06 26, 2005",2005,4298,"['Many', 'years', 'ago', 'Ron', 'Wyatt', 'intrepid', 'explorer', 'claimed', 'have', 'found', 'real', 'Mount', 'Sinai', 'becoming', 'one', 'many', 'men', 'have', 'made', 'claim', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'many', 'claims', 'also', 'claimed', 'have', 'found', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'chariot', 'wheels', 'Red', 'Sea', 'Ark', 'Covenant', 'ruins', 'Sodom', 'Gomorrah', 'even', 'hole', 'Jesus', 'cross', 'was', 'placed', 'Wyatt', 'largely', 'been', 'exposed', 'fraud', 'people', 'continue', 'believe', 'did', 'find', 'clues', 'leading', 'location', 'mountain', 'God', 'gave', 'Law', 'Moses.Enter', 'two', 'American', 'adventurers', 'Several', 'years', 'ago', 'Bob', 'Cornuke', 'former', 'police', 'officer', 'Larry', 'Williams', 'commodities', 'trader', 'embarked', 'adventure', 'find', 'real', 'Mount', 'Sinai', 'Borrowing', 'Wyatt', 'data', 'moving', 'forward', 'three', 'assumptions', 'determined', 'likely', 'site', 'mountain', 'was', 'Midian', 'now', 'part', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'assumptions', 'were', 'First', 'Sinai', 'Peninsula', 'was', 'considered', 'part', 'Land', 'Egypt', 'hence', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'location', 'Mt', 'Sinai', 'Bible', 'clearly', 'Israelites', 'went', 'Egypt', 'second', 'Mt', 'Sinai', 'Land', 'Midian', 'third', 'according', 'Galatians', '4:25', 'Mt', 'Sinai', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Now', 'Hagar', 'Mount', 'Sinai', 'Arabia', 'Arabia', 'day', 'same', 'Paul', 'day', 'Many', 'scholars', 'would', 'take', 'issue', 'assumptions.With', 'falsified', 'documents', 'Cornuke', 'Williams', 'entered', 'Saudi', 'Kingdom', 'began', 'search', 'Search', 'Real', 'Mt', 'Sinai', 'documentary', 'DVD', 'details', 'search', 'original', 'footage', 'recorded', 'journey', 'dramatic', 'recreations', 'What', 'found', 'true', 'greatest', 'archaelogical', 'discovery', 'Dead', 'Sea', 'Scrolls', 'claim', 'have', 'found', 'well', 'Marah', 'twelve', 'springs', 'Elim', 'caves', 'Moses', 'Jethro', 'altar', 'golden', 'calf', 'altar', 'Moses', 'twelve', 'representing', 'twelve', 'tribes', 'Israel', 'blackened', 'rock', 'when', 'God', 'came', 'mountain', 'fire', 'split', 'rock', 'Horeb', 'water', 'flowed', 'claim', 'have', 'found', 'nearly', 'irrefutible', 'evidence', 'real', 'Mount', 'Sinai.The', 'explorers', 'believe', 'common', 'knowledge', 'part', 'world', 'found', 'mountain', 'identified', 'probable', 'Mt', 'Sinai', 'surrounded', 'fence', 'heavily', 'guarded', 'Saudi', 'troops', 'something', 'script', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'crawled', 'past', 'fence', 'dead', 'night', 'finding', 'way', 'night', 'vision', 'goggles', 'avoid', 'detection', 'Finally', 'scaled', 'mountain', 'found', 'amazing', 'discoveries.In', 'short', 'DVD', 'very', 'convincing', 'case', 'men', 'truly', 'did', 'find', 'real', 'Mount', 'Sinai', 'always', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'story', 'easy', 'convince', 'ignorant', 'laypeople', 'experts', 'have', 'raised', 'serious', 'questions', 'validities', 'claims', 'most', 'biblical', 'issues', 'nobody', 'can', 'be', 'neutral', 'person', 'something', 'lose', 'something', 'gain.The', 'DVD', 'fascinating', 'informative', 'though', 'unfortunately', 'far', 'more', 'recreated', 'footage', 'original', 'photos', 'video', 'production', 'very', 'good', 'about', 'equal', 'level', 'quality', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'Learning', 'Channel', 'Discovery.As', 'wrote', 'earlier', 'review', 'men', 'have', 'found', 'accurate', 'have', 'made', 'discovery', 'incredible', 'importance', 'Watching', 'DVD', 'difficult', 'be', 'swayed', 'excitement', 'determination', 'adventure', 'great', 'story', 'when', 'reality', 'sets', 'are', 'many', 'difficult', 'questions', 'remain', 'unanswered', 'are', 'able', 'suspend', 'reason', 'just', 'little', 'bit', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'presentation', 'be', 'swept', 'away', 'possibility', 'might', 'be', 'seeing', 'very', 'described', 'Bible', 'when', 'credits', 'roll', ""'ll"", 'be', 'forced', 'remember', 'walk', 'faith', 'not', 'sight', 'not', 'biblical', 'site', 'matters', 'little', 'faith', 'allow', 'faith', 'be', 'shaped', 'such', 'discoveries', 'will', 'have', 'little', 'depth', 'will', 'be', 'easily', 'swayed', 'evil', 'adulterous', 'generation', '[', ']', 'sign', 'can', 'enjoy', 'good', 'story', 'even', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true']",The Search for the Real Mt.
