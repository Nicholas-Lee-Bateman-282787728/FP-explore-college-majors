1359572,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B003R0MEZ4,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[14, 19]","Spoiler Alert: There are casting changes which take place this season which were heavily reported online even before the season began.  If you missed those articles and also do not want to know who is being eliminated then do NOT read this review.CRIMINAL MINDS had protracted ways of getting rid of cast members this season.  When networks do this, the members leaving are not pulling in enough favorable ratings to make the network offer them lucrative staying options.  So the solution is to then get rid of those members.  Thus two female members of the team were given very plot heavy exits which went on and on over many episodes.  I could have completely done without this and found both stories boring as they were of little to no forensic interest.  It seems that CM knows which characters to keep for the long haul and those are all of the guys and Penelope, the computer whiz gal.  Anyone else who comes in may be there only a short while.  All of these ""exiting cast member episodes"" were barely watchable.  Ironically, if you are a really good looking person, you are almost certain toast for remaining in this show.  These actors who look like movie starlets are the ones being let go, not the ones who might pass as real FBI agents.  So I suppose that at least is refreshing.The other episodes were business as usual and delivered the same high quality law enforcement and forensic cases we've gotten used to over the past six years.  Perhaps my favorite one was a serial killer with Alzheimer's who has been ""retired"" for many years who comes out of retirement for one last killing spree.  That was a very unique episode.  When the show sticks with the team flying off to go help local law enforcement solve a very complex murder case, the show is first rate.So I hope this season sees the end of the musical chairs.  There is a British show called MI-5 about UK spies.  Whenever a cast member leaves that show, typically the cast member is just blown up in one episode and that is that.  It is a bit jarring but I will take that approach rather than these protracted leavings.",4,Still Enjoyable But Cast Reshuffling Is Bothersome,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,2093,"['Spoiler', 'Alert', 'are', 'casting', 'changes', 'take', 'place', 'season', 'were', 'heavily', 'reported', 'online', 'even', 'season', 'began', 'missed', 'articles', 'also', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'know', 'who', 'being', 'eliminated', 'then', 'do', 'NOT', 'read', 'review.CRIMINAL', 'MINDS', 'had', 'protracted', 'ways', 'getting', 'rid', 'cast', 'members', 'season', 'When', 'networks', 'do', 'members', 'leaving', 'are', 'not', 'pulling', 'enough', 'favorable', 'ratings', 'make', 'network', 'offer', 'lucrative', 'staying', 'options', 'solution', 'then', 'get', 'rid', 'members', 'Thus', 'two', 'female', 'members', 'team', 'were', 'given', 'very', 'plot', 'heavy', 'exits', 'went', 'many', 'episodes', 'could', 'have', 'completely', 'done', 'found', 'stories', 'boring', 'were', 'little', 'forensic', 'interest', 'CM', 'characters', 'keep', 'long', 'haul', 'are', 'guys', 'Penelope', 'computer', 'whiz', 'gal', 'Anyone', 'else', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'short', 'while', 'exiting', 'cast', 'member', 'episodes', 'were', 'barely', 'watchable', 'Ironically', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'looking', 'person', 'are', 'almost', 'certain', 'toast', 'remaining', 'show', 'actors', 'who', 'look', 'movie', 'starlets', 'are', 'ones', 'being', 'let', 'go', 'not', 'ones', 'who', 'might', 'pass', 'real', 'FBI', 'agents', 'So', 'suppose', 'least', 'refreshing.The', 'other', 'episodes', 'were', 'business', 'usual', 'delivered', 'same', 'high', 'quality', 'law', 'enforcement', 'forensic', 'cases', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'used', 'past', 'six', 'years', 'Perhaps', 'favorite', 'one', 'was', 'serial', 'killer', 'Alzheimer', 'who', 'been', 'retired', 'many', 'years', 'who', 'retirement', 'one', 'last', 'killing', 'spree', 'was', 'very', 'unique', 'episode', 'When', 'show', 'team', 'flying', 'off', 'go', 'help', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'solve', 'very', 'complex', 'murder', 'case', 'show', 'first', 'rate.So', 'hope', 'season', 'end', 'musical', 'chairs', 'British', 'show', 'called', 'MI-5', 'UK', 'spies', 'Whenever', 'cast', 'member', 'show', 'typically', 'cast', 'member', 'just', 'blown', 'up', 'one', 'episode', 'bit', 'jarring', 'will', 'take', 'approach', 'rather', 'protracted', 'leavings']",Criminal Minds: Season 6

1359583,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B003R0MEZ4,D. S. Thurlow,"[24, 26]","In its sixth season, ""Criminal Minds"" continues to be an outstanding police procedural about the agents of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit.  The show offers intense weekly drama as the agents track various serial killers and kidnappers.A strength of the show is its superb ensemble cast, featuring Thomas Gibson as team leader Aaron Hotchner, Joe Montegna as veteran Special Agent David Rossi, Paget Brewster as Special Agent Emily Prentiss, Matthew Gray Gubler as Dr. Spencer Reid, Shemar Moore as Special Agent Derek Morgan, A.J. Cook as Special Agent JJ Jareau, and Kirsten Vangness as computer whiz Penelope Garcia.This season brought cast changes.  JJ Jareau was involutarily reassigned from the BAU at the beginning of the season, then helped out in a mid-season case involving Emily Prentiss.  Her brief appearence in the season finale suggests she will return.  Rachel Nichols joined the cast as young Ashley Seaver, a new agent plucked from the FBI Academy for her specialized personal knowledge of serial killers.  At season's end, a burned-out Penelope Garcia was contemplating a less traumatic career choice.The highlight of the season may have been the series of episodes involving a man from Emily Prentiss's past.  The charming, vicious arms dealer Ian Doyle, formerly the target of a Interpol undercover operation, stalked Prentiss over three episodes, in the process endangering the rest of the team.  In a shocking climax, Doyle kidnapped and tortured Emily while the team raced to the rescue.  In a stunning conclusion, a fight to the death caused the loss of a team member.  The BAU dealt with that loss in the remaining episodes.""Criminal Minds: The Sixth Season"" is very highly recommended to its fans.

Shows/cases were interesting, but when talking about crime shows (such as CSI, Law&Order, etc...) they are always interesting.  So, question is the storyline and casting.  I believe getting rid of JJ was a mistake.  She brought normalcy and realism to the show.  While other profilers/agents could be replaced (such was the case in NCIS and not to forget Gideon from this show), JJ was different.  And the new girl was useless.  On top of that, I believe JJ was fan favorite.  Also, storyline was weak.  They tried to give each character a story of their own, but failed. Especially, I found Prentiss' sub-story to be ridiculus and uninteresting.  Her story ran through three plus episodes and I fast-forwarded good 25% of her story (I didn't miss anything).

1359588,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003R0MEZ4,Grady Harp,"[61, 72]","CRIMINAL MINDS grows and grows and this season is an exceptional one. While if continues to bring us smart television, the secondary subplots that continue through this season, plot that focus on the lead actors  and their private lives or personal involvement with some of the created characters takes a major role in this season.  While some may find this a bit disconcerting - as though emphasis on the diagnosis and capture of the criminal minds disconnects the viewer form the point of direction of the story. But at least for this viewer these subplots make us identify more with the agony of coping with the types of criminals these people must deal with every day. The dialogue may at some points seem like a roundtable dissertation on aspects of abnormal psychology, passing from one character actor in the investigative team to the next, but the information they disclose in these sessions is fascinating and makes sense to the viewer. Each segment begins with a significant quote and each ends with one and this seemingly small technique shows respect for the viewer. The cases more often than not are those of serial killers, showing us how these criminal minds are created by their background, what constitutes their behavior, and how examining that studied behavior as each new case develops leads to their capture.The cast still includes the magnetic Shemar Moore, Paget Brewster, the intense Thomas Gibson, A.J. Cook, Matthew Gray Gubler as the would be nerd but brilliant thinker, Joe Mantegna and Kirsten Vangsnes (often the brains behind the breaks!).

1359606,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003R0MEZ4,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","I've always said that one of the true benefits of DVDs is the chance to see your favorite TV series whenever you want to. Not only that but it gives series a chance to be seen, especially when one series is programmed against another. Series that at one time might have died off because no one watched their second season gain viewers when people see the first season on DVD and realize what they were missing. After 6 seasons that might not be the case with CRIMINAL MINDS, but for those who've never been exposed now is the time with the release of season 6 on DVD. Don't worry if you're starting here, the series is easy to get into.If you've never seen the series it follows the BAU (Behavioral Analysis Unit), a specialized group of profilers at the FBI that tracks down serial criminals, usually killers. A profiler is a trained agent skilled in the psychology of the criminal mind, a person who attempts to track down the killer by getting in their head. And this team is the best there is.The BAU is led by agent Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson),  a dedicated individual who guards his team as well as possible. The team also has David Rossi (Joe Mantegna), an ex-agent turned author who came back to join this team. Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore) is the most physical of the team while also the most emotional. Jennifer Jareau (A.J.Cook) is the team's press liaison and case organizer. Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster) is an effective thinker and effective interrogator. Dr. Spencer Reed (Matthew Gray Gubler) is a young genius with an analytical mind that sees patterns where others can not. And rounding out the team is  Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness), a computer whiz who stays in constant touch with the team where ever they are, finding information for them when in need.The thing about this team is that not only do they seem like a working group of agents, there is a closeness about them as well. If you continue to watch the series you'll get a sense of family about them. Each one has his role, though not in the sense of father or sister. Instead you get the feeling of familiarity between characters and once hooked on the series with viewers as well. That was seen in this season when one of the characters left and viewer outcry resulted in her return this year.So you have the set up of the series, agents tracking down criminals, flying here and there ready to take on any and all bad guys. So what happens this season that hasn't before? It opens with the second of two parts, finalizing the cliffhanger from season 5. The Prince of Darkness killer has returned for some unknown reason and takes the life of a policeman before the team can take him out of play. This results in the daughter of the policeman becoming the responsibility of Derek which comes into play in several of the episodes.As I stated, one of the agents is forced to move up in the FBI though she'd rather not. This results in several situations for the team; having to deal with her departure, trying to take over her responsibilities and eventually finding another member for the team. Again, this takes place over several episodes but contributes to the sense of loss for the team and for viewers.Various cases offer bloody situations and extreme violence not usually shown on TV. Then again we're talking about serial killers for the most part and their actions are almost always violent. So a word to the wise when choosing who should and shouldn't be watching this show. Adults will have no problem but younger children might.The acting is unbelievable for having a cast this size. Each member is given equal opportunity to shine and not one stands above the rest. They all form believable characters that long term viewers grow to care about. Should you choose to watch you will too.The season ends with a twist that few saw coming. Will it result in the loss or return of a character? What actually happened? And will we find out the answer come next season? No one knows except the writers who will let us know at their leisure. Until then we'll have to content ourselves by having the chance to watch this season over and over again, viewing our favorite episodes and enjoying those not quite on our list. It doesn't matter because there isn't an episode that isn't done well.With the frightening fact that there are at any time dozens if not hundreds of potential serial killers out there, its nice to know that a team like this actually exist. Let's hope for two things. The first, that they're as successful as the team here is. The second, that those killers remain only ""potential"" knowing that the team is out there. This is a series not to be missed and one of the best TV has to offer right now.",5,ONE OF TV'S BEST SERIES,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4709,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'said', 'one', 'true', 'benefits', 'DVDs', 'chance', 'see', 'favorite', 'TV', 'series', 'whenever', 'want', 'Not', 'only', 'series', 'chance', 'be', 'seen', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'series', 'programmed', 'Series', 'one', 'time', 'might', 'have', 'died', 'off', 'one', 'watched', 'second', 'season', 'gain', 'viewers', 'when', 'people', 'see', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'realize', 'what', 'were', 'missing', '6', 'seasons', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'CRIMINAL', 'MINDS', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'exposed', 'now', 'time', 'release', 'season', '6', 'DVD', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'re"", 'starting', 'here', 'series', 'easy', 'get', 'into.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'series', 'BAU', 'Behavioral', 'Analysis', 'Unit', 'specialized', 'group', 'profilers', 'FBI', 'down', 'serial', 'criminals', 'usually', 'killers', 'profiler', 'trained', 'agent', 'skilled', 'psychology', 'criminal', 'mind', 'person', 'who', 'track', 'down', 'killer', 'getting', 'head', 'team', 'best', 'is.The', 'BAU', 'led', 'agent', 'Aaron', 'Hotchner', 'Thomas', 'Gibson', 'dedicated', 'individual', 'who', 'team', 'as', 'well', 'possible', 'team', 'also', 'David', 'Rossi', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'ex-agent', 'turned', 'author', 'who', 'came', 'back', 'join', 'team', 'Derek', 'Morgan', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'most', 'physical', 'team', 'also', 'most', 'emotional', 'Jennifer', 'Jareau', 'A.J.Cook', 'team', 'press', 'liaison', 'case', 'organizer', 'Emily', 'Prentiss', 'Paget', 'Brewster', 'effective', 'thinker', 'effective', 'interrogator', 'Dr.', 'Spencer', 'Reed', 'Matthew', 'Gray', 'Gubler', 'young', 'genius', 'analytical', 'mind', 'patterns', 'where', 'others', 'can', 'not', 'rounding', 'out', 'team', 'Penelope', 'Garcia', 'Kirsten', 'Vangsness', 'computer', 'whiz', 'who', 'constant', 'touch', 'team', 'where', 'ever', 'are', 'finding', 'information', 'when', 'need.The', 'thing', 'team', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'seem', 'working', 'group', 'agents', 'closeness', 'about', 'as', 'well', 'continue', 'watch', 'series', ""'ll"", 'get', 'sense', 'family', 'one', 'role', 'not', 'sense', 'father', 'sister', 'Instead', 'get', 'feeling', 'familiarity', 'characters', 'once', 'hooked', 'series', 'viewers', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'seen', 'season', 'when', 'one', 'characters', 'left', 'viewer', 'outcry', 'resulted', 'return', 'year.So', 'have', 'set', 'series', 'agents', 'tracking', 'down', 'criminals', 'flying', 'here', 'there', 'ready', 'take', 'bad', 'guys', 'So', 'what', 'season', ""n't"", 'before', 'second', 'two', 'parts', 'finalizing', 'cliffhanger', 'season', '5', 'Prince', 'Darkness', 'killer', 'returned', 'unknown', 'reason', 'life', 'policeman', 'team', 'can', 'take', 'play', 'results', 'daughter', 'policeman', 'becoming', 'responsibility', 'Derek', 'play', 'several', 'episodes.As', 'stated', 'one', 'agents', 'forced', 'move', 'up', 'FBI', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'results', 'several', 'situations', 'team', 'having', 'deal', 'departure', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'responsibilities', 'eventually', 'finding', 'member', 'team', 'Again', 'place', 'several', 'episodes', 'contributes', 'sense', 'loss', 'team', 'viewers.Various', 'cases', 'offer', 'bloody', 'situations', 'extreme', 'violence', 'not', 'usually', 'shown', 'TV', 'Then', 'again', ""'re"", 'talking', 'serial', 'killers', 'most', 'part', 'actions', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'violent', 'word', 'wise', 'when', 'choosing', 'who', 'should', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'show', 'Adults', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'younger', 'children', 'might.The', 'acting', 'unbelievable', 'having', 'cast', 'size', 'member', 'given', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'shine', 'not', 'one', 'rest', 'form', 'believable', 'characters', 'long', 'term', 'viewers', 'grow', 'care', 'Should', 'choose', 'watch', 'will', 'too.The', 'season', 'twist', 'few', 'saw', 'coming', 'Will', 'result', 'loss', 'return', 'character', 'What', 'actually', 'happened', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'answer', 'come', 'season', 'one', 'writers', 'who', 'will', 'let', 'know', 'leisure', 'then', ""'ll"", 'have', 'content', 'having', 'chance', 'watch', 'season', 'over', 'again', 'viewing', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'enjoying', 'not', 'quite', 'list', ""n't"", 'matter', ""n't"", 'episode', ""n't"", 'done', 'well.With', 'frightening', 'fact', 'are', 'time', 'dozens', 'not', 'hundreds', 'potential', 'serial', 'killers', 'there', 'nice', 'know', 'team', 'actually', 'exist', 'Let', 'hope', 'two', 'things', 'first', ""'re"", 'as', 'successful', 'team', 'here', 'second', 'killers', 'remain', 'only', 'potential', 'knowing', 'team', 'out', 'there', 'series', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'offer', 'right', 'now']",Criminal Minds: Season 6

I think the characters are great but I must admit I would love to see Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin) brought back in some way without taking anything away from Joe Mantegna who plays Rossi.There is one thing that may seem to be trivial - it seems that the packaging and presentation of all the CBS series gets poorer with each series available in DVD format.
