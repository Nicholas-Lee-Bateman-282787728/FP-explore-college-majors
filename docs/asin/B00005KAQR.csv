For that mater the musical was better. However it is everyone's right to try something different. Who knows until you try? However there is no excuse for the unprofessional singing and there was more missing than they said there would be. (See my review of the soundtrack that they actually are trying to sell).Now trying not to compare the 1956 movie, this rendition is still stilted and unprofessional. The actors do not fit the characters they play. And the storyline is much harder to follow. I can understand trying something different.

661518,A1F1XYMX769KWE,B00005KAQR,Cissa,"[0, 1]","I've read several of the objections to this version, and while in a sense i agree- I think it worked really well.I was put off by the huge age differences in the original film. Both Liat and Nellie seemed to be WAY young for their loves.In this one, at least Liat looks to be of legal age, and Nellie is an experienced and sensible woman who gets bowled off her feet by love. Now Nellie's ups and downs- ""Wash that man out of my Hair"" vs. 30 seconds later ""In Love with a Wonderful Guy"" are more typical of younger folk... but I like that she's more of a peer of Emile, rather than a chick half his age. It did work well when she got over her issues and embraced his kids as her step-kids.The Thanksgiving show was a high point, and done brilliantly well, with all the gender-bending and the burlesque of the original (or more).This version seemed to have more focus on the war, which was appropriate.I like it a lot. The singing was maybe not so good, but it felt more coherent to me. Close was especially well-cast here- she really made us feel for Nellie.This musical was originally staged in 1949, well before any Civil Rights actions, and it did deal with racism in a pretty blunt and unforgiving way. That's one of the things I admire about R&H; musicals- they generally do have a very progressive political agenda- once one gets over the catchy songs, anyway!Recommended if you like ""South Pacific"", or simply musicals with some points behind the catchy songs.

While I too at first was bothered with the age of Glenn Close, I soon forgot her age once I became involved in this very entertaining movie.

What it is, I guess, is a musical for people (namely younger viewers) who've grown up on action TV and movies and don't really understand Broadway musicals. The radically different approach may not bother some, but to me, this version of the classic R &amp; H musical comes off mainly as an action drama where the songs are treated as an after-thought. They're there and mostly acceptably done (except for the whispered rather than operatic basso profundo performances of the French planter). The shuffling of the songs isn't that bothersome but that change of focus is. Glenn Close isn't the brassy young filly of the original, and that's OK. She finds a new way to do it. And she's a muscial comedy pro, with B'way credentials. The rest of the performers (who aren't) are just OK and their roles are acted than sung.

661524,A3AGTNGBCUX7GI,B00005KAQR,James W. Mccully,"[9, 13]","I looked forward to this tv movie and hoped it would be an improvement on the original. It wasn't. It made me appreciate the original. Glenn Close is just too old for that part. She is supposed to be a naive young girl falling for an older French man.  While she sings fine, she is just too old. I think they tried to pretend like age wasn't an issue but it was. Mitzi Gaynor did a better job and was the right age. I think the racial issue in the movie of marrying a man with Polynesian children is not such an issue in 2001.  Also to Lt. Cable being with a Polynesian woman.  Harry Connick Jr. didn't really change the way the original did his part except for I think wanting to marry the Polynesian girl.  How in the world could he fall in love with a girl that he just met? It was just a roll in the hay.  Also, I saw him on some show like Rosie and he had never seen the original. I found that very hard to believe being a music person. How could you not see the great musicals of all time?The French man cannot nearly sing as well as the original though I think in the original movie he was dubbed.Why in the world did they have to sensationalize Lt. Cable's death by having him being blown away by a land mine. In the original he dies with dignity quietly. Maybe it's just because kids want to see action these days.Billis is not as funny as Ray Walston's portrayal. He doesn't seem the least bit as embarrassed or have any strong portrayal or insight of his character that I can see.I know the orignal is no masterpiece and the colored filters kind of take away from things, but it does have it's good points. Mitzi Gaynor seems so flustered and bothered when she learns that Emile has mixed children which then she would have been. I think it's not such an issue in this because like I said this is 2001 although the story is set during WWII.  The movie needed a younger leading lady, a better singing French man, and they should have kept You've Got to Be Taught because that is one of the most important themes of the story that people are taught racism;they aren't born with it.I wish that they would remake Mame( the Lucille Ball fiasco). Heard they might.  Now that one needs to be remade. I think I read that they were thinking about Cher which I don't see how in the world that would work.  Too bad they didn't make it with Angela Lansbury when they could have back then. I love Lucy but she was horrible.

661535,A1SMNK99BI7WTE,B00005KAQR,"Mark Andrew Lawrence ""Theatre Reviewer""","[53, 58]","Though the stage show was one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's biggest hits, the script has not aged well. It is overlong and lacking in subtleness. The 1958 film, despite the beautiful scenery, is played woodenly. Even Rodgers and Hammerstein expressed disappointment with the finished film.So, in 2000, ABC TV and Glen Close produced a new TB film with a new script that weaves in most of the songs and situations of the original play while at the same time fleshing out the characters and making them more realistic.Is the film a complete success? Well, no. For starters Glen Close is too old for the role of Nellie. She does act it well, however, and she sings with a characterful chest voice though I do detect some of her high notes might be dubbed. I have just re-watched the movie and don't find her all that objectionable. She sounds like she is having fun cutting loose in ""I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair"" and ""A Wonderful guy."" Remember too that Mary Marin and Mitzi Gaynor were both too old for the role originally. What Glen Close does play very effectively is Nellie's warring emotions. Aided by the camera work, we see her confusion and unhappiness when confronted with her own prejudices.Rade Sherbedgia certainly looks the part of DeBecque but since we are so used to hearing robust Bass singers in the role, his softly sung arias take a good deal of getting used to. Instead of an outpouring of emotion in ""this Nearly Was Mine"" he offers a more introspective take on the role. It's actually a good idea and might work better with a stronger singer. His acting is quite good but the script does tend to shortchange Emile in favour of Nellie.Harry Connick Jr acts the part of Cable quite well and shades the characters different emotions. True he is more of New Orleans than Philadelphia, and like the others he tends to pull the big musical moments inward.  It is most effective in the scene after he first makes love to Liat and croons a tender ""Younger Than Springtime.""  This is everything that the sung ought to be... passionate, sexy and filled with wonder. This is a young man caught off guard by true love for the first time and Connick communicates that brilliantly.  His ""crooning"" is not wildly out-of-place and certainly in keeping with the types of singers he would have heard at home. Some scenes later he performs a remarkably understated ""Carefully Taught"" having played the intense anger in the dialogue scene that precedes the song. The result is more a case of Cable realizing what he is saying than just spitting out an angry indictment. It may not be the way it was originally done, but you can't argue with its effectiveness.Lori Tan Chin as Bloody Mary is much closer to the description provided by James Michener in his original novel than Juanita Hall.  Hall indeed made the part her own, but that is not to say that hers was definitive.In re-writing the screenplay, the scenes and songs were re-arranged from their traditional order. In this new version we see the first meeting of Nellie and Emile at an officers club dance, and the song ""A Cockeyed Optimist"" is used in this sequence to establish Nellie's outlook.  It's part of her charm and clearly attracts DeBecque.  The structure also allows the first two scenes of the musical to unfold simultaneously.Anyone considering a Broadway revival of SOUTH PACIFIC might do well to examine the TV film for its style and construction. There might indeed be a way to make the story work for modern audiences, clearing away some of the hoary old jokes and developing character instead.",4,"Interesting, different take on SOUTH PACIFIC",1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,3583,"['stage', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'biggest', 'hits', 'script', 'not', 'aged', 'well', 'overlong', 'lacking', 'subtleness', '1958', 'film', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'played', 'woodenly', 'Even', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'expressed', 'disappointment', 'finished', 'film.So', '2000', 'ABC', 'TV', 'Glen', 'Close', 'produced', 'new', 'TB', 'film', 'new', 'script', 'most', 'songs', 'situations', 'original', 'play', 'same', 'time', 'fleshing', 'out', 'characters', 'making', 'more', 'realistic.Is', 'film', 'complete', 'success', 'Well', 'starters', 'Glen', 'Close', 'too', 'old', 'role', 'Nellie', 'act', 'well', 'however', 'characterful', 'chest', 'voice', 'do', 'detect', 'high', 'notes', 'might', 'be', 'dubbed', 'have', 'just', 're-watched', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'objectionable', 'having', 'fun', 'cutting', 'loose', ""'m"", 'Gon', 'Wash', 'That', 'Man', 'Right', 'Outa', 'My', 'Hair', 'Wonderful', 'guy', 'Remember', 'too', 'Mary', 'Marin', 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'were', 'too', 'old', 'role', 'originally', 'What', 'Glen', 'Close', 'play', 'very', 'effectively', 'Nellie', 'warring', 'emotions', 'Aided', 'camera', 'work', 'see', 'confusion', 'unhappiness', 'when', 'confronted', 'own', 'prejudices.Rade', 'Sherbedgia', 'certainly', 'part', 'DeBecque', 'are', 'so', 'used', 'hearing', 'robust', 'Bass', 'singers', 'role', 'softly', 'sung', 'arias', 'take', 'good', 'deal', 'getting', 'used', 'Instead', 'outpouring', 'emotion', 'Nearly', 'Was', 'Mine', 'more', 'introspective', 'take', 'role', 'actually', 'good', 'idea', 'might', 'work', 'better', 'stronger', 'singer', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'script', 'tend', 'shortchange', 'Emile', 'favour', 'Nellie.Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr', 'part', 'Cable', 'quite', 'well', 'characters', 'different', 'emotions', 'True', 'more', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Philadelphia', 'others', 'pull', 'big', 'musical', 'moments', 'inward', 'most', 'effective', 'scene', 'first', 'love', 'Liat', 'croons', 'tender', 'Younger', 'Than', 'Springtime', 'everything', 'sung', 'ought', 'be', 'passionate', 'sexy', 'filled', 'wonder', 'young', 'man', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'true', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'Connick', 'brilliantly', 'crooning', 'not', 'wildly', 'out-of-place', 'certainly', 'keeping', 'types', 'singers', 'would', 'have', 'heard', 'home', 'scenes', 'later', 'remarkably', 'understated', 'Carefully', 'Taught', 'having', 'played', 'intense', 'anger', 'dialogue', 'scene', 'song', 'result', 'more', 'case', 'Cable', 'realizing', 'what', 'saying', 'just', 'spitting', 'out', 'angry', 'indictment', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'way', 'was', 'originally', 'done', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', 'effectiveness.Lori', 'Tan', 'Chin', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'much', 'closer', 'description', 'provided', 'James', 'Michener', 'original', 'novel', 'Juanita', 'Hall', 'Hall', 'indeed', 'made', 'part', 'own', 'not', 'say', 'hers', 'was', 'definitive.In', 're-writing', 'screenplay', 'scenes', 'songs', 'were', 're-arranged', 'traditional', 'order', 'new', 'version', 'see', 'first', 'meeting', 'Nellie', 'Emile', 'officers', 'club', 'dance', 'song', 'Cockeyed', 'Optimist', 'used', 'sequence', 'establish', 'Nellie', 'outlook', 'part', 'charm', 'clearly', 'attracts', 'DeBecque', 'structure', 'also', 'first', 'two', 'scenes', 'musical', 'unfold', 'simultaneously.Anyone', 'considering', 'Broadway', 'revival', 'SOUTH', 'PACIFIC', 'might', 'do', 'well', 'examine', 'TV', 'film', 'style', 'construction', 'might', 'indeed', 'be', 'way', 'make', 'story', 'work', 'modern', 'audiences', 'clearing', 'away', 'hoary', 'old', 'jokes', 'developing', 'character', 'instead']",Rodgers & Hammerstein's South Pacific VHS

661537,A1RPTVW5VEOSI,B00005KAQR,Michael J. Edelman,"[30, 36]","Let me begin by saying I absolutely love South Pacific. It was the very first musical I ever saw (my parents took me to the movie when it came out, when I was hardly more than an infant) and I grew up listening to the Broadway sound track.I'm a big fan of Harry Connick Jr.'s musical work, and I think he's an excellent actor. I've been impressed by Glen Close's work, I think Robery Pastorelli is a pretty decent comic actor, and when I saw the ""Making of South Pacific"" promo on TV, I made a point of setting my VCR to catch the movie. I was ready to really enjoy this show.And boy, was I let down. First of all, no matter how good she looks, Glen Close does not look like a young nurse. She doesn't even look like a middle aged nurse. In her scenes with Rade Sherbedgia, despite all the soft focus photography (and half of this movie looked like it was shot through a pound of vaseline) she didn't look anything like a young woman swept off her feet by an older man. To tell the truth, she looked like Sherbedgia's mother. When Nellie sings that she's just a simple girl and Emil is a sophisticated man, it borders on the tragicomic.But what makes or breaks a great musical is the singing. Both the Broadway and the original Hollywood versions of this movie were characterized by great voices. The part of Emile de Becque was played on Broadway by Ezio Pinza, and on the screen sung by Giorgio Tozzi, both strong and expressive baritones with an operatic background. The ingenue leads were the great Mary Martin and Mitzi Gaynor. Even the smaller parts were played by dynamic performers like Broadway's Juanita Hall, whose ""Bali Hai"" sends chills down your back.But these TV version is completely lacking in anything approaching a dynamic vocal performance. Connick, an excellent singer in his own genre, does a workmanlike job with ""Younger Than Springtime"" and then delivers a half-spoken, half sung and essentially emotionless version of ""You've Got To Be Taught"". Sherbedgia, who has some of the strongest songs in the show, can barely produce a whisper. When Pinza sang ""This Once Was Mine"" it brought tears to your eyes; when Sherbedgia sings it, it's incidental music. It's almost as if the entire cast were picked so as not to show up the limited vocal abilities of the star.All in all a tremendous disappointment. Even if you liked the TV version- especially if you liked it- you owe it to yourself to buy the Broadway album and hear this music as it was meant to be heard.",2,Disappointing,1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,2485,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'absolutely', 'love', 'South', 'Pacific', 'was', 'very', 'first', 'musical', 'ever', 'saw', 'parents', 'took', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'hardly', 'more', 'infant', 'grew', 'up', 'listening', 'Broadway', 'sound', 'track.I', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'musical', 'work', 'think', 'excellent', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'been', 'impressed', 'Glen', 'Close', 'work', 'think', 'Robery', 'Pastorelli', 'pretty', 'decent', 'comic', 'actor', 'when', 'saw', 'Making', 'South', 'Pacific', 'promo', 'TV', 'made', 'point', 'setting', 'VCR', 'catch', 'movie', 'was', 'ready', 'really', 'enjoy', 'show.And', 'boy', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'First', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'Glen', 'Close', 'not', 'look', 'young', 'nurse', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'middle', 'aged', 'nurse', 'scenes', 'Rade', 'Sherbedgia', 'soft', 'focus', 'photography', 'half', 'movie', 'looked', 'was', 'shot', 'pound', 'vaseline', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'anything', 'young', 'woman', 'swept', 'off', 'feet', 'older', 'man', 'tell', 'truth', 'looked', 'Sherbedgia', 'mother', 'When', 'Nellie', 'just', 'simple', 'girl', 'Emil', 'sophisticated', 'man', 'tragicomic.But', 'what', 'breaks', 'great', 'musical', 'singing', 'Broadway', 'original', 'Hollywood', 'versions', 'movie', 'were', 'characterized', 'great', 'voices', 'part', 'Emile', 'de', 'Becque', 'was', 'played', 'Broadway', 'Ezio', 'Pinza', 'screen', 'sung', 'Giorgio', 'Tozzi', 'strong', 'expressive', 'baritones', 'operatic', 'background', 'ingenue', 'were', 'great', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'Even', 'smaller', 'parts', 'were', 'played', 'dynamic', 'performers', 'Broadway', 'Juanita', 'Hall', 'Bali', 'Hai', 'chills', 'down', 'back.But', 'TV', 'version', 'completely', 'lacking', 'anything', 'approaching', 'dynamic', 'vocal', 'performance', 'Connick', 'excellent', 'singer', 'own', 'genre', 'workmanlike', 'job', 'Younger', 'Than', 'Springtime', 'then', 'half-spoken', 'half', 'sung', 'essentially', 'emotionless', 'version', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Be', 'Taught', 'Sherbedgia', 'who', 'strongest', 'songs', 'show', 'can', 'barely', 'produce', 'whisper', 'When', 'Pinza', 'sang', 'Once', 'Was', 'Mine', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'when', 'Sherbedgia', 'incidental', 'music', 'almost', 'entire', 'cast', 'were', 'picked', 'so', 'not', 'show', 'up', 'limited', 'vocal', 'abilities', 'star.All', 'tremendous', 'disappointment', 'Even', 'liked', 'TV', 'version-', 'especially', 'liked', 'it-', 'owe', 'buy', 'Broadway', 'album', 'hear', 'music', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'heard']",Rodgers & Hammerstein's South Pacific VHS

661540,A1CA1A1MGW0I3J,B00005KAQR,Raisuli the Magnificent,"[0, 0]","This is an okay production.  To be honest Glenn Close is far too old to play the part of a young waif enlisted in the nurses corps in the South Pacific.  But, she is a highly talented actress, and and puts her heart and soul in the effort.  I'm almost sold on it.To be blunt, the other thing about this production is that it lacks scope.  Simply put there needed to be more extras and larger panoramic shots to show the vistas of the South Pacific.  And that's what makes the original production a a better film.  Both sets of actors are highly competent.  Both fit their roles after a fashion.  Both productions give us the tale of confronting prejudice and racism, though it must be said that the Disney production hits it a little more head on than the original film.  The original production takes on the same subject, but, literally dances around the subject a bit more than the Disney production.Further, the Disney production includes the fight scene between the lieutenant and the enlisted men, which was cut from the original film.  The Disney production's intent was to give a more honest production than the original film could have given the social restrictions at the time.For a Disney film it was highly controversial.  Essentially there's a love making scene in the film, which for either production was a huge gamble.  Did it pay off?  I'm not sure.

661541,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00005KAQR,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[20, 33]","Truthfully, I was skeptical about the remaking of a movie based on James Michener's Pulitzer Prize-winning book Tales of the South Pacific. I mean, how could you top the 1958 version, which in my mind is one of the greatest love stories of all time.Well, that was until Rade Sherbedgia filled the role of the French Plantation owner, Emile. Glenn Close was a delight as Nellie. Here she almost adds a mature innocence to the story. She is filled with a intoxicating love for life, yet experiences the sadness of almost losing her chance at finding paradise because of her own inner demons.Harry Connick Jr. adds a much more lusty flavor to this version as the Navy officer who is entranced by a beautiful Tonkinese girl and the tropical beauty of Bali Ha'i.In general, there are a few scenes I felt were a bit overplayed and they should have included scenes that were much more exotic, like swimming by a waterfall or kissing while rolling on a beach in the surf.There is rarely a story that can so capture the imagination. It is a story of love and loss in which four souls don't know why they feel the way they do, they just know that they do feel themselves being drawn into the path of destiny.If you are looking for gripping suspense, drama, timeless songs, romance, seductive tropical islands, interracial romance and intense emotions all woven into a story about a naval base during the second world war, here it is!Terribly Romantic and an final scene that will make you cry. Not that it is sad, but because love can be so beautiful when two souls finally find what they have looked for all their life.If you love to run barefoot on a beach in the middle of a storm,this is your movie!Note: If you love the song: Bali Ha'i, I highly recommend Enchantment by Charlotte Church!

661542,A1N441OPDOIL3T,B00005KAQR,R.L.,"[0, 3]","I just saw this movie on Ovation TV, and I must say I was impressed--especially with Glenn Close, who plays Mary Martin very well though not with the soprano voice Mary had. Glenn is a very fine actress, however, and she gives a strong performance. I say Mary Martin, because I think Glenn was thinking Mary every second of her performance--right down to her hairstyle. Her vocals are surprisingly well done. The music is glorious, one of R&H;'s very best musicals. Some very fine singers in that male chorus, from someone who has belted out ""There is nothing like a dame"" in my day.This is a much better effort than the original Hollywood movie, and gets closer to the central theme of racial intolerance. ""You've got to be carefully taught"" is a remarkable song for its day, before the advent of civil rights in this country. A brave effort by R&H;, way ahead of its time.A little story about Mary Martin: Noel Coward discovered her in the chorus of a movie(it may have been one of those Fred Astaire musicals--can't recall), and cast her in the lead of his new musical, Pacific 1860, in the mid-1940s. The show was a flop, but got Mary the lead role in R&H;'s new musical, South Pacific, a year or two later. South Pacific, of course, was one of the biggest hit musicals ever, and made Martin a star. She and Coward remained close friends, and did a TV show together in the mid1950s.What has happened to this wonderful genre?

A lot of the original ideas are outmoded, but the new screenplay adds dimension to the story and characters only hinted at 50 years ago.  The restructuring of the material, opening the show with THERE IS NOTHIN' LIKE A DAME, making Nellie Forbush, brilliantly and vibrantly played by our greatest American actress, Glenn Close, older, and strengthening the mission the DeBecque and Cable take on, are just some of this version's better changes.There's nothing in the story that says Nellie needs to be in her 20s, and Glenn Close fulfills the promise of movie musical magic she hinted at during her engagement onstage in SUNSET BLVD.  When she stands on the balcony and sings the TWIN SOLILOQUIES, you feel her falling in love with Emile.  This Bloody Mary, small and mean as can be, a woman who would sell her daughter if she can make a profit, is a frighteningly real woman, not the caricature she's been played as in the past.  (In a college production I saw, they had to do BALI HA'I as a comedy song because Bloody Mary couldn't pull off the drama!)Harry Connick,Jr. is absolutely right as Lt. Cable,and his romantic renderings of CAREFULLY TAUGHT, YOUNGER THAN SPRINGTIME, and (on CD) MY GIRL BACK HOME show that he's the greatest crooner of standards in pop music.Take a different viewpoint when you watch this SOUTH PACIFIC.  See it, not as a film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's greatest libretto, but as a genuine presentation of World War II.  When looking at it as a war picture, it takes on a new dimension, and plays as the very real drama Michener portrayed in his novel, and which was what was hoped for on the stage.  Be thankful that those awful filters which ruined the 1959 version are gone, and that Bali Ha'i is seen in Cable's mind, as it was meant to be seen.  Enjoy the lively dance on the beach as Nellie and the girls perform A WONDERFUL GUY, and melt as Emile sings SOME ENCHANTED EVENING.This SOUTH  PACIFIC is a triumph!  It's a masterful production of a great musical.
