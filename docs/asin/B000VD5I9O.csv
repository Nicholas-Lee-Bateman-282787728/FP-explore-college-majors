The film can said to be more of an emphasis on Gandhi's personal life rather than being termed as a Biography. I was overwhelmed a lot by the film. Excellent performences, priceless dialogues and beautifull cinematography generally makes a good film and this film has it all. The film will shock you, make you smile, make you think. A touching and warm chemistry between Gandhi and his son Harilal. The music is beautifull and haunting, the film is definately worth a watch. Many know him as the Leader of the Nation, how many knew him as a parent, a father? a cinema definately worth appreciating.",5,"A film hard to forget, a story hard to digest!",1218412800,"08 11, 2008",2008,694,"['Shocking', 'yes', 'shocking', 'would', 'be', 'initial', 'word', 'give', 'slightest', 'description', 'film', 'film', 'can', 'said', 'be', 'more', 'emphasis', 'Gandhi', 'personal', 'life', 'rather', 'being', 'termed', 'Biography', 'was', 'overwhelmed', 'lot', 'film', 'Excellent', 'performences', 'priceless', 'dialogues', 'beautifull', 'cinematography', 'generally', 'good', 'film', 'film', 'film', 'will', 'shock', 'make', 'smile', 'make', 'think', 'touching', 'warm', 'chemistry', 'Gandhi', 'son', 'Harilal', 'music', 'beautifull', 'haunting', 'film', 'definately', 'worth', 'watch', 'Many', 'know', 'Leader', 'Nation', 'how', 'many', 'knew', 'parent', 'father', 'cinema', 'definately', 'worth', 'appreciating']",Gandhi My Father
1100651,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000VD5I9O,Artist & Author,"[5, 5]","I don't think any movie has changed my opinion of a person more than this story about Gandhi, the larger than life 'father' if India's independence.  The accomplishments of Gandhi the man are well known.  This movie focuses on Gandhi's relationship with his family, specifically with his oldest son, Harilal.  When Gandhi was a crown attorney in South Africa, Harilil was old enough to go to university.  He wanted to study law in England, to become a lawyer like his father.  A group had actually donated money for Harilil to go to England, but his father was so focused on his movement he insisted on giving the money to another of his followers.  Even when that man failed in his studies, Gandhi insisted on giving the scholarship to another man, but not to Harilil.  As a result, Harilil was unable to obtain the education he so desperately wanted.This exemplifies Gandhi's consistent behavior toward his son.  He simply undermined almost everything he did.  Even when Harilal wanted to get married, Gandhi was ready to disown him for marrying too young.  [The movie says that Gandhi and his wife were married at age thirteen.]  So, this is a heartbreaking movie about a son who ached to win his father's admiration by his own accomplishments, but whose father undermined or denigrated every such effort.  Is it any wonder that Harilal passed away, an unrecognizable drunk, only five months after his father was assassinated?",5,Heartbreaking Story of the Son of a Giant,1211760000,"05 26, 2008",2008,1429,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'changed', 'opinion', 'person', 'more', 'story', 'Gandhi', 'larger', 'life', 'India', 'independence', 'accomplishments', 'Gandhi', 'man', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'movie', 'Gandhi', 'relationship', 'family', 'specifically', 'oldest', 'son', 'Harilal', 'When', 'Gandhi', 'was', 'crown', 'attorney', 'South', 'Africa', 'Harilil', 'was', 'old', 'enough', 'go', 'university', 'wanted', 'study', 'law', 'England', 'become', 'lawyer', 'father', 'group', 'had', 'actually', 'donated', 'money', 'Harilil', 'go', 'England', 'father', 'was', 'so', 'focused', 'movement', 'insisted', 'giving', 'money', 'followers', 'Even', 'when', 'man', 'failed', 'studies', 'Gandhi', 'insisted', 'giving', 'scholarship', 'man', 'not', 'Harilil', 'result', 'Harilil', 'was', 'unable', 'obtain', 'education', 'so', 'desperately', 'wanted.This', 'exemplifies', 'Gandhi', 'consistent', 'behavior', 'son', 'simply', 'undermined', 'almost', 'everything', 'did', 'Even', 'when', 'Harilal', 'wanted', 'get', 'married', 'Gandhi', 'was', 'ready', 'disown', 'marrying', 'too', 'young', '[', 'movie', 'Gandhi', 'wife', 'were', 'married', 'age', 'thirteen', 'So', 'heartbreaking', 'movie', 'son', 'who', 'ached', 'win', 'father', 'admiration', 'own', 'accomplishments', 'father', 'undermined', 'denigrated', 'such', 'effort', 'wonder', 'Harilal', 'passed', 'away', 'unrecognizable', 'drunk', 'only', 'five', 'months', 'father', 'was', 'assassinated']",Gandhi My Father
1100652,AH9K6PPVZKVY3,B000VD5I9O,Barbara (Burkowsky) Underwood,"[13, 13]","I was pleasantly surprised and deeply touched by this Indian film with the intriguing title ""Gandhi My Father"" - a concept most of us outside India had probably never considered, namely that the famous freedom fighter and social reformer who changed the course of India's history was also a family man and father, struggling with personal issues like everyone else.  Or maybe not like everyone else, because it soon becomes apparent that Gandhi's eldest son, Harilal, cannot live up to his father's high expectations and perhaps like many children of successful or famous people, flounders in the shadow of his larger-than-life father who became the nation's idol.  Revered as the Father of a Nation whom Indians affectionately called ""Bapu"" meaning Dad, Gandhi gave his life and soul for the freedom and happiness of his people, but could not prevent his own son from succumbing to alcoholism and dying alone in a Bombay hospital as an dirty, unknown, drunken beggar.  This film very effectively covers 40 years in just two hours, capturing the highlights and critical moments which changed the course of Harilal's life, leading to its tragic end.  It is very reminiscent of the multi-award-winning ""Gandhi"" starring Ben Kingsley, and can be seen as a companion to this film as it explores the personal side of Gandhi's life far removed from the tumultuous political and social events, yet irrevocably intertwined with them because every step Gandhi took to reform and help his nation was a step further away from his son.From the outset of the film we get to know Gandhi as a man of very high moral and spiritual principles who firmly and passionately adheres to them both in family life, in his work as a lawyer, and of course later, as India's spiritual and moral leader.  And spare a thought for Gandhi's faithful wife who struggled to find a balance between supporting Gandhi's important, self-sacrificing ambitions for the good of all, and the wellbeing and happiness of the family and children.  There are many thought-provoking concepts and issues to ponder over and to question as the film touches briefly yet poignantly on the most relevant and deepest matters affecting the family's life. The film does not take sides or judge or condemn anyone, and tells the story of people living through tumultuous decades in a very beautiful and artistic style with brilliant photography, soft colours and soft lighting.  It is authentically Indian with quite traditional music, but no song and dance scenes which are the trademark of most `Bollywood' films.  This is not such a popular or commercial movie, but a serious and artistic film with as much meaning and depth as the viewer cares to take from it.  To underscore the historic significance of the story, authentic newsreel footage is used briefly a few times in this film which heightens the emotional intensity of the story, particularly as it reaches its climax.  For a perfect balance of serious history and artistic excellence, ""Gandhi My Father"" is a special viewing experience, and will linger on in one's memory long afterwards.",5,A beautiful and stirring real-life story,1196640000,"12 3, 2007",2007,3094,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'deeply', 'touched', 'Indian', 'film', 'intriguing', 'title', 'Gandhi', 'My', 'Father', 'concept', 'most', 'India', 'had', 'probably', 'never', 'considered', 'namely', 'famous', 'freedom', 'fighter', 'social', 'reformer', 'who', 'changed', 'course', 'India', 'history', 'was', 'also', 'family', 'man', 'father', 'struggling', 'personal', 'issues', 'everyone', 'else', 'maybe', 'not', 'everyone', 'else', 'soon', 'apparent', 'Gandhi', 'eldest', 'son', 'Harilal', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'father', 'high', 'expectations', 'perhaps', 'many', 'children', 'successful', 'famous', 'people', 'flounders', 'shadow', 'larger-than-life', 'father', 'who', 'became', 'nation', 'idol', 'Revered', 'Father', 'Nation', 'whom', 'Indians', 'affectionately', 'called', 'Bapu', 'meaning', 'Dad', 'Gandhi', 'gave', 'life', 'soul', 'freedom', 'happiness', 'people', 'could', 'not', 'prevent', 'own', 'son', 'succumbing', 'alcoholism', 'dying', 'alone', 'Bombay', 'hospital', 'dirty', 'unknown', 'drunken', 'beggar', 'film', 'very', 'effectively', '40', 'years', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'capturing', 'highlights', 'critical', 'moments', 'changed', 'course', 'Harilal', 'life', 'leading', 'tragic', 'end', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'multi-award-winning', 'Gandhi', 'starring', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'companion', 'film', 'personal', 'side', 'Gandhi', 'life', 'far', 'removed', 'tumultuous', 'political', 'social', 'events', 'yet', 'irrevocably', 'intertwined', 'step', 'Gandhi', 'took', 'reform', 'help', 'nation', 'was', 'step', 'further', 'away', 'son.From', 'outset', 'film', 'get', 'know', 'Gandhi', 'man', 'very', 'high', 'moral', 'spiritual', 'principles', 'who', 'firmly', 'passionately', 'adheres', 'family', 'life', 'work', 'lawyer', 'course', 'later', 'India', 'spiritual', 'moral', 'leader', 'spare', 'thought', 'Gandhi', 'faithful', 'wife', 'who', 'struggled', 'find', 'balance', 'supporting', 'Gandhi', 'important', 'self-sacrificing', 'ambitions', 'good', 'wellbeing', 'happiness', 'family', 'children', 'are', 'many', 'thought-provoking', 'concepts', 'issues', 'ponder', 'question', 'film', 'touches', 'briefly', 'yet', 'poignantly', 'most', 'relevant', 'deepest', 'matters', 'affecting', 'family', 'life', 'film', 'not', 'take', 'sides', 'judge', 'condemn', 'anyone', 'story', 'people', 'living', 'tumultuous', 'decades', 'very', 'beautiful', 'artistic', 'style', 'brilliant', 'photography', 'soft', 'colours', 'soft', 'lighting', 'authentically', 'Indian', 'quite', 'traditional', 'music', 'song', 'dance', 'scenes', 'are', 'trademark', 'most', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'not', 'such', 'popular', 'commercial', 'movie', 'serious', 'artistic', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'meaning', 'depth', 'viewer', 'take', 'underscore', 'historic', 'significance', 'story', 'authentic', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'used', 'briefly', 'few', 'times', 'film', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'story', 'particularly', 'climax', 'perfect', 'balance', 'serious', 'history', 'artistic', 'excellence', 'Gandhi', 'My', 'Father', 'special', 'viewing', 'experience', 'will', 'linger', 'one', 'memory', 'long', 'afterwards']",Gandhi My Father
1100653,AW3I97UR8NP7T,B000VD5I9O,"Karen Shaub ""Nickname:  Queen B""","[2, 2]","While reading a collection of Gandhi's writings I came upon a mention of his son having converted to Islam. I was very surprised since Attenborough's film had completely skipped over any children and so I couldn't wait to see this film when I learned of it. I was expecting them to have had some sort of violent, acrimonious parting, but that doesn't really seem to have been the case.The story is an old one though; very successful Dad expects son to go into the family business but son wants to do something else and this inevitably drives a wedge between them. The main difference is that here the son wants to be what his Dad USED to be (namely a Barrister) and Dad's new business is Self-Sacrificing Servant of the People. The son (Harilal) follows obediently through the early years in South Africa, all the while quietly harboring a small grudge because others are given what he feels should be his, but he never gives up his dreams of accomplishing something big and impressing Dad--never realizing that all it would take to do that would be to live a life of self-sacrifice as his father did.Its a sad story of a father and mother whose arms are always open to welcome back a son who just can't stay out of trouble and ultimately uses the family name to steal money from others. Its also the story of how a great man can be a father to millions who have never seen him, but can't really connect with a child born of his own blood. My one problem with the film was the casting. So much depended on Akshaye Khanna as Harilal, and to me he was inadequate. He had one expression that resembled nothing so much as cocker spaniel that has just been caught urinating on the carpet. However Shefali Shah as Hari's mother is truly the shining star in this film. Her suffering as she tries to hold her family together is poignant and will resonate with all audiences.",4,A Great Soul Does Not Always Make a Good Father,1243036800,"05 23, 2009",2009,1866,"['reading', 'collection', 'Gandhi', 'writings', 'came', 'mention', 'son', 'having', 'converted', 'Islam', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'Attenborough', 'film', 'had', 'completely', 'skipped', 'children', 'so', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'film', 'when', 'learned', 'was', 'expecting', 'have', 'had', 'sort', 'violent', 'acrimonious', 'parting', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'case.The', 'story', 'old', 'one', 'though', 'very', 'successful', 'Dad', 'son', 'go', 'family', 'business', 'son', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'inevitably', 'wedge', 'main', 'difference', 'here', 'son', 'be', 'what', 'Dad', 'USED', 'be', 'namely', 'Barrister', 'Dad', 'new', 'business', 'Self-Sacrificing', 'Servant', 'People', 'son', 'Harilal', 'obediently', 'early', 'years', 'South', 'Africa', 'while', 'quietly', 'harboring', 'small', 'grudge', 'others', 'are', 'given', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'never', 'up', 'dreams', 'accomplishing', 'something', 'big', 'impressing', 'Dad', 'never', 'realizing', 'would', 'take', 'do', 'would', 'be', 'live', 'life', 'self-sacrifice', 'father', 'sad', 'story', 'father', 'mother', 'arms', 'are', 'always', 'open', 'welcome', 'back', 'son', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'trouble', 'ultimately', 'family', 'name', 'steal', 'money', 'others', 'also', 'story', 'how', 'great', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'father', 'millions', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'connect', 'child', 'born', 'own', 'blood', 'one', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'casting', 'So', 'much', 'depended', 'Akshaye', 'Khanna', 'Harilal', 'was', 'inadequate', 'had', 'one', 'expression', 'resembled', 'nothing', 'so', 'much', 'cocker', 'spaniel', 'just', 'been', 'caught', 'urinating', 'carpet', 'However', 'Shefali', 'Shah', 'Hari', 'mother', 'truly', 'shining', 'star', 'film', 'suffering', 'hold', 'family', 'together', 'poignant', 'will', 'resonate', 'audiences']",Gandhi My Father
1100654,A228JH8V9Y700G,B000VD5I9O,MortensOrchid,"[1, 2]","Sometimes the most miserable of people can produce the best people.  A person unfortunate enough to be born into a lower class in an abusive home with parents, relatives or all other forces outside will neglect them, and somehow a resilient person will pull themselves out of the gutter and make themselves into someone.  And, the inverse is possible as well.  How ironic that a man who is one of the most beloved people who ever lived, who brought millions to freedom, whose very name to this day will bring tears to our eyes, would have a child who was just such a disappointment.Gandhi My Father is the story of Hari, Mahatmah Gandhi's oldest son, and their relationship.  Hari seemed to always doubt himself in his youth, feeling as if he could never be good enough to live up to his father.  Gandhi, as he began his freedom fighting work to bring down the British Empire in South Africa, had all of his children living with him and working towards his cause on his commune.  Oddly enough, even though Gandhi himself was an educated person, did not want his children to pursue an education but to give themselves over to his cause.  While his other children may have done just so and seemed perfectly happy doing so, his oldest son, Hari, seemed to want an opportunity to travel to England and earn his law degree.  He married against Gandhi's wishes, and would eventually pursue an education in England as he wanted.Hari's life, however, turned into a series of false starts and failures.  Unable to pass his exams, getting into business scams in an attempt to get rich quick, Hari kept floundering.  When his marriage falls apart, it spells the beginning of the end, as Hari resents his successful father and feels wronged.  He lashes out at his father publicly, and Gandhi responds with published articles warning others not to invest in his cons.  Hari converts to Islam to spite his father, wearing out his welcome by the benefactors who wanted to use his and his famous father's name.Perhaps the hardest moments to watch are when Hari attempts to come home to his parents, in the classic Prodigal Son moment.  His drunken antics have embarrassed his shifty benefactors and they threw him out onto the streets.  Having lost everything, he comes back to his elderly parents in one more attempt to seek their forgiveness.  There are only so many times one can forgive someone for their bad behavior.  Even unconditional parental love has its limits.  Gandhi was human, as were all the saints before him, but we remember his good works and inspiration to millions rather than his failed son.  Is this a reflection of his parenting skills?  Maybe so.  But, adults make their own choices as well despite what a parent may or may not do or say.  When his father dies and all of India cries, Hari is truly alone.  He attends his father's funeral with the millions of others, then dies alone, broke, drunk, filthy and homeless in a welfare hospital.This was, also, my first real Bollywood movie.  It comes with English subtitles, which are a must.  The Special Features ""Making of"" does not come with subtitles, which is a bit of a disappointment.  Still, it was a wonderful, moving film about a little known tale about one of history's greatest people.",5,The Prodigal Son,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,3254,"['Sometimes', 'most', 'miserable', 'people', 'can', 'produce', 'best', 'people', 'person', 'unfortunate', 'enough', 'be', 'born', 'lower', 'class', 'abusive', 'home', 'parents', 'relatives', 'other', 'forces', 'outside', 'will', 'neglect', 'somehow', 'resilient', 'person', 'will', 'pull', 'gutter', 'make', 'someone', 'inverse', 'possible', 'as', 'well', 'How', 'ironic', 'man', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'people', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'who', 'brought', 'millions', 'freedom', 'very', 'name', 'day', 'will', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'would', 'have', 'child', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'such', 'disappointment.Gandhi', 'My', 'Father', 'story', 'Hari', 'Mahatmah', 'Gandhi', 'oldest', 'son', 'relationship', 'Hari', 'seemed', 'always', 'doubt', 'youth', 'feeling', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'live', 'up', 'father', 'Gandhi', 'began', 'freedom', 'fighting', 'work', 'bring', 'down', 'British', 'Empire', 'South', 'Africa', 'had', 'children', 'living', 'working', 'towards', 'cause', 'commune', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'even', 'Gandhi', 'was', 'educated', 'person', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'children', 'pursue', 'education', 'give', 'cause', 'other', 'children', 'may', 'have', 'done', 'just', 'so', 'seemed', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'doing', 'so', 'oldest', 'son', 'Hari', 'seemed', 'want', 'opportunity', 'travel', 'England', 'earn', 'law', 'degree', 'married', 'Gandhi', 'wishes', 'would', 'eventually', 'pursue', 'education', 'England', 'life', 'however', 'turned', 'series', 'false', 'starts', 'failures', 'Unable', 'pass', 'exams', 'getting', 'business', 'scams', 'attempt', 'get', 'rich', 'quick', 'Hari', 'kept', 'floundering', 'When', 'marriage', 'apart', 'beginning', 'end', 'Hari', 'successful', 'father', 'feels', 'wronged', 'out', 'father', 'publicly', 'Gandhi', 'published', 'articles', 'warning', 'others', 'not', 'invest', 'cons', 'Hari', 'Islam', 'spite', 'father', 'wearing', 'out', 'welcome', 'benefactors', 'who', 'wanted', 'use', 'famous', 'father', 'name.Perhaps', 'hardest', 'moments', 'watch', 'are', 'when', 'Hari', 'come', 'home', 'parents', 'classic', 'Prodigal', 'Son', 'moment', 'drunken', 'antics', 'have', 'embarrassed', 'shifty', 'benefactors', 'threw', 'out', 'streets', 'Having', 'lost', 'everything', 'back', 'elderly', 'parents', 'one', 'more', 'attempt', 'seek', 'forgiveness', 'are', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'one', 'can', 'forgive', 'someone', 'bad', 'behavior', 'Even', 'unconditional', 'parental', 'love', 'limits', 'Gandhi', 'was', 'human', 'were', 'saints', 'remember', 'good', 'works', 'inspiration', 'millions', 'rather', 'failed', 'son', 'reflection', 'parenting', 'skills', 'Maybe', 'so', 'adults', 'make', 'own', 'choices', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'parent', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'do', 'say', 'When', 'father', 'dies', 'India', 'cries', 'Hari', 'truly', 'alone', 'father', 'funeral', 'millions', 'others', 'then', 'alone', 'broke', 'drunk', 'filthy', 'homeless', 'welfare', 'hospital.This', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'real', 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'must', 'Special', 'Features', 'Making', 'not', 'come', 'subtitles', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'Still', 'was', 'wonderful', 'moving', 'film', 'little', 'known', 'tale', 'one', 'history', 'greatest', 'people']",Gandhi My Father

Here I use my holding back the fifth star to call attention to an aspect of the film.  There seems to me to be a problem in the structuring of the film.  The last part of the film relies heavily on a newsreel story.  It seemed to me, and I may be wrong, that if this last part was treated with the same intimacy as the earlier portions of the film, it would have been overlong.  However, I feel the distancing from the emotional center of the story in order to get in the rest of the content of the story weakens the last portion.
