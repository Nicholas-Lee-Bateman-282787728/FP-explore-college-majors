692981,AH9K6PPVZKVY3,B0000633T0,Barbara (Burkowsky) Underwood,"[8, 10]","I was very impressed and completely enthralled by both features on this DVD and highly recommend it for anyone who values a quality silent drama.  Both films are powerful dramas with outstanding acting, great suspense and in &quot;Manslaughter&quot; some deep and meaningful messages.  Not everyone might get the same out of this movie, by the sounds of it, but I for one found it exceptionally good.  You can take three sides:  for spoilt brat Lydia, her desperate maid with a sick boy, or O'Bannon the District Attorney who is torn between love for justice and love for Lydia.  There is a theme of soul-searching and finding yourself, getting your priorities right, and the uselessness of a debauched life of parties and booze.  There are various things to take away from this great movie, so take your pick!For me, the musical score by the Alloy Orchestra was superb and perfectly suited, esp. the fast, lively Jazz for the party scenes and fast cars.  I also found it a very interesting and nice change from the usual standard piano or organ score that faithfully plods along to most silent films, so it might not sound like 'an orchestra falling down the stairs' to everyone!The Cheat is a shorter and even more suspenseful film in some ways, and its picture quality is better than Manslaughter, but I feel they complement each other well on this DVD.  Both of them highlight women living a dangerous lifestyle on the edge and its consequences - no different back then than today, no doubt, but despite the age of these movies, still as stark and powerful as if they were new.  Definitely rivetting viewing!",5,Simply Brilliant!,1086912000,"06 11, 2004",2004,1612,"['was', 'very', 'impressed', 'completely', 'enthralled', 'features', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'quality', 'silent', 'drama', 'films', 'are', 'powerful', 'dramas', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'great', 'suspense', 'quot', 'Manslaughter', 'quot', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'messages', 'Not', 'everyone', 'might', 'get', 'same', 'movie', 'sounds', 'one', 'found', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'can', 'take', 'three', 'sides', 'spoilt', 'brat', 'Lydia', 'desperate', 'maid', 'sick', 'boy', ""O'Bannon"", 'District', 'Attorney', 'who', 'torn', 'love', 'justice', 'love', 'Lydia', 'theme', 'soul-searching', 'finding', 'getting', 'priorities', 'right', 'uselessness', 'debauched', 'life', 'parties', 'booze', 'are', 'various', 'things', 'take', 'away', 'great', 'movie', 'so', 'take', 'pick', 'musical', 'score', 'Alloy', 'Orchestra', 'was', 'superb', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'esp', 'fast', 'lively', 'Jazz', 'party', 'scenes', 'fast', 'cars', 'also', 'found', 'very', 'interesting', 'nice', 'change', 'usual', 'standard', 'piano', 'organ', 'score', 'faithfully', 'along', 'most', 'silent', 'films', 'might', 'not', 'sound', 'orchestra', 'falling', 'down', 'stairs', 'everyone', 'Cheat', 'shorter', 'even', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'ways', 'picture', 'quality', 'better', 'Manslaughter', 'feel', 'complement', 'other', 'well', 'DVD', 'highlight', 'women', 'living', 'dangerous', 'lifestyle', 'edge', 'consequences', 'different', 'back', 'then', 'today', 'doubt', 'age', 'movies', 'still', 'stark', 'powerful', 'were', 'new', 'Definitely', 'rivetting', 'viewing']",Manslaughter / The Cheat
692982,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B0000633T0,Chip Kaufmann,"[4, 5]","Cecil B. DeMille was one of the most successful filmmakers of all time. He was also one of the most critically reviled. Almost 50 years after his death (he died in 1959), his name is still well known to the public. What a tribute to the staying power of his many films. His career spanned over 40 years from THE SQUAW MAN in 1913 to THE TEN COMMANDMENTS in 1956. DeMille was the P.T. Barnum of the movies. He knew all the tricks of the trade and how to use them for the greatest effect. He also knew what his public wanted to see and gave it to them. His skills as a director were such that his films continue to entertain and fascinate us today long after his many negative reviews have been forgotten. While there is much to criticize, there is even more to enjoy. Most of his sound films are well known and are frequently shown on TV but not his silent films which have been unavailable until recently.This DVD collects 2 films from the silent era which represent the best and worst of early DeMille. MANSLAUGHTER (1922) is making its home video debut. This was the sort of potboiler that DeMille regularly cranked out between his large scale projects such as the first version of THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (1923). It features Leatrice Joy (John Gilbert's wife and DeMille's replacemnt for Gloria Swanson) as a good time party girl who almost comes to a bad end only to be redeemed at the end. At this stage of his career DeMille loved to throw in historic flashbacks to contrast and compare to contemporary life. This time around it's Ancient Rome and its decadence. The pompous moralizing of the Thomas Meighan character was only natural in the wake of the Fatty Arbuckle and William Desmond Taylor scandals (both at DeMille's home studio of Paramount) but neither DeMille nor most of his audience took it seriously. The print used for MANSLAUGHTER which was taken from the Killiam Collection is OK for the most part and is probably the best there is. After all this is certainly no masterpiece but it remains an interesting social document of the time.THE CHEAT has already been on DVD coupled with DeMille's CARMEN. Here is a totally different DeMille. Using cutting, lighting, and settings to great effect for such an early film (1915), he manages to turn a routine melodrama of the time into a film which is still gripping today thanks in no small part to the charismatic presence of Sessue Hayakawa who many years later would portray the Camp Commander in BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. This is the same excellent transfer by Film Preservation Associates used for the earlier DVD. A must for the silent film buff and for anyone interested in the early career of one of America's best known film directors. This is part of Kino International's VAMPS, VIXENS, & VIRGINS series, a title old C.B. would have loved.",4,The Best And Worst Of Early DeMille.,1017705600,"04 2, 2002",2002,2810,"['Cecil', 'B.', 'DeMille', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'filmmakers', 'time', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'critically', 'reviled', '50', 'years', 'death', 'died', '1959', 'name', 'still', 'well', 'known', 'public', 'What', 'tribute', 'staying', 'power', 'many', 'films', 'career', 'spanned', '40', 'years', 'THE', 'SQUAW', 'MAN', '1913', 'THE', 'TEN', 'COMMANDMENTS', '1956', 'DeMille', 'was', 'P.T', 'Barnum', 'movies', 'knew', 'tricks', 'trade', 'how', 'use', 'greatest', 'effect', 'also', 'knew', 'what', 'public', 'wanted', 'see', 'gave', 'skills', 'director', 'were', 'such', 'films', 'continue', 'entertain', 'fascinate', 'today', 'long', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'forgotten', 'much', 'criticize', 'even', 'more', 'enjoy', 'Most', 'sound', 'films', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'are', 'frequently', 'shown', 'TV', 'not', 'silent', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'unavailable', 'recently.This', 'DVD', '2', 'films', 'silent', 'era', 'represent', 'best', 'worst', 'early', 'DeMille', 'MANSLAUGHTER', '1922', 'making', 'home', 'video', 'debut', 'was', 'sort', 'potboiler', 'DeMille', 'regularly', 'cranked', 'out', 'large', 'scale', 'projects', 'such', 'first', 'version', 'THE', 'TEN', 'COMMANDMENTS', '1923', 'Leatrice', 'Joy', 'John', 'Gilbert', 'wife', 'DeMille', 'replacemnt', 'Gloria', 'Swanson', 'good', 'time', 'party', 'girl', 'who', 'almost', 'bad', 'end', 'only', 'be', 'redeemed', 'end', 'stage', 'career', 'DeMille', 'loved', 'throw', 'historic', 'flashbacks', 'contrast', 'compare', 'contemporary', 'life', 'time', 'Ancient', 'Rome', 'decadence', 'pompous', 'moralizing', 'Thomas', 'Meighan', 'character', 'was', 'only', 'natural', 'wake', 'Fatty', 'Arbuckle', 'William', 'Desmond', 'Taylor', 'scandals', 'DeMille', 'home', 'studio', 'Paramount', 'DeMille', 'most', 'audience', 'took', 'seriously', 'print', 'used', 'MANSLAUGHTER', 'was', 'taken', 'Killiam', 'Collection', 'OK', 'most', 'part', 'probably', 'best', 'certainly', 'no', 'masterpiece', 'interesting', 'social', 'document', 'time.THE', 'CHEAT', 'already', 'been', 'DVD', 'coupled', 'DeMille', 'CARMEN', 'Here', 'totally', 'different', 'DeMille', 'Using', 'cutting', 'lighting', 'settings', 'great', 'effect', 'early', 'film', '1915', 'turn', 'routine', 'melodrama', 'time', 'film', 'still', 'gripping', 'today', 'thanks', 'small', 'part', 'charismatic', 'presence', 'Sessue', 'Hayakawa', 'who', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'would', 'portray', 'Camp', 'Commander', 'BRIDGE', 'ON', 'THE', 'RIVER', 'KWAI', 'same', 'excellent', 'transfer', 'Film', 'Preservation', 'Associates', 'used', 'earlier', 'DVD', 'must', 'silent', 'film', 'buff', 'anyone', 'interested', 'early', 'career', 'one', 'America', 'best', 'known', 'film', 'directors', 'part', 'Kino', 'International', 'VAMPS', 'VIXENS', 'VIRGINS', 'series', 'title', 'old', 'C.B', 'would', 'have', 'loved']",Manslaughter / The Cheat
692983,A3B2GBS56JWXRV,B0000633T0,Eric Stott,"[14, 14]","Two examples of why Cecil DeMille was a success. The Cheat is a fine film full of subtle touches. The lighting and composition are breathtaking, and it's fascinating to see a youthful Sessue Hayakawa far far before his ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" role.Manhunter is a different item, but no less fascinating. It's a totally commercial film and even shows an artistic and commercial decline from the earlier work. There is hardly a subtle moment in it, it's over the top all the way with the throttle wide open. Leatrice Joy and Lois Wilson, both unjustly forgotten stars, give fine performances and manage to win the audience's hearts.I'm giving this edition only 4 out of 5 stars because of the soundtrack to Manslaughter. The Alloy Orchestra tries hard, but they are more annoying than supporting here. Their sound (it's like a percussion section falling downstairs with a singing saw accompaniment) is well suited to stylized films like Metropolis and Strike, but in my opinion it is a detraction here.",4,Pictures of the period,1044835200,"02 10, 2003",2003,1003,"['Two', 'examples', 'why', 'Cecil', 'DeMille', 'was', 'success', 'Cheat', 'fine', 'film', 'full', 'subtle', 'touches', 'lighting', 'composition', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'fascinating', 'see', 'youthful', 'Sessue', 'Hayakawa', 'far', 'far', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'role.Manhunter', 'different', 'item', 'less', 'fascinating', 'totally', 'commercial', 'film', 'even', 'artistic', 'commercial', 'decline', 'earlier', 'work', 'hardly', 'subtle', 'moment', 'top', 'way', 'throttle', 'wide', 'open', 'Leatrice', 'Joy', 'Lois', 'Wilson', 'unjustly', 'forgotten', 'stars', 'give', 'fine', 'performances', 'manage', 'win', 'audience', 'hearts.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'edition', 'only', '4', '5', 'stars', 'soundtrack', 'Manslaughter', 'Alloy', 'Orchestra', 'hard', 'are', 'more', 'annoying', 'supporting', 'here', 'sound', 'percussion', 'section', 'falling', 'downstairs', 'singing', 'saw', 'accompaniment', 'well', 'suited', 'stylized', 'films', 'Metropolis', 'Strike', 'opinion', 'detraction', 'here']",Manslaughter / The Cheat

Preachy and melodramatic, with some tintalating Roman orgy scenes thrown in, MANSLAUGHTER isn't one of the best silent films, but it's still entertaining thanks to DeMille.I have to agree with others on the score. It was hit or miss. Alloy Orchestra recycled some of their (musical saw) score to THE LOST WORLD for this one. While it was perfectly suited to THE LOST WORLD, it didn't work here. I kept waiting for the dinosaurs to appear. Alloy should have put away the musical saw for this one or there should have been a second score to choose from. It's still not the worse silent score from a major release. That honor goes to the score from PICCADILLY. I had to mute that one. A great film ruined by a bad score.Also on this disc is THE CHEAT which should have had top billing. It's a classic. Great film and great Robert Israel score. The branding and ending scenes are a must see. As far as I can tell it's the same version shown on TCM, which is the 1918 re-release changing the intertitles to make the Sessue Hayakawa character Burmese rather than Japanese as in the original 1915 release.

This was by the Alloy Orchestra, whom I had heard both in person and on recordings, and I knew pretty well what to expect.  The sound most closely resembles somebody throwing empty garbage cans down a concrete stairway.  They did a little better this time, though, at least some attempt was made to match music to the action, but it was a rather poor one.  The historically accurate accompaniment would have been by an orchestra, a piano, or an organ, not something that sounded electronic and haphazard.  It was particularly annoying to hear what sounded like a theramin, which was not even invented until half a decade after the film came out.  Much better to watch this flick with the sound turned off, and that's why it only garnered four stars from me.",4,"Good movies, lousy accompaniment on Manslaughter",1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,846,"['enjoyed', 'movies', 'was', 'very', 'distracted', 'background', 'music', 'Manslaughter', 'was', 'Alloy', 'Orchestra', 'whom', 'had', 'heard', 'person', 'recordings', 'knew', 'pretty', 'well', 'what', 'expect', 'sound', 'most', 'closely', 'somebody', 'throwing', 'empty', 'garbage', 'cans', 'down', 'concrete', 'stairway', 'did', 'little', 'better', 'time', 'though', 'least', 'attempt', 'was', 'made', 'match', 'music', 'action', 'was', 'rather', 'poor', 'one', 'historically', 'accurate', 'accompaniment', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'orchestra', 'piano', 'organ', 'not', 'something', 'sounded', 'electronic', 'haphazard', 'was', 'particularly', 'annoying', 'hear', 'what', 'sounded', 'theramin', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'invented', 'decade', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'Much', 'better', 'watch', 'flick', 'sound', 'turned', 'off', 'why', 'only', 'garnered', 'four', 'stars']",Manslaughter / The Cheat

In the years between the first film: The Cheat from 1915, and the second: Manslaughter from 1922, De Mille went from being a director of quality films to a director of commercial films.Manslaughter is the film that people who have never seen a silent film are expecting to see: a melodrama without subtlety. This is the Cecil B. De Mille who - although derided by his peers and critics - became a great commercial director for the remainder of his career.The Cheat is De Mille at his artistic peak. This is the film that is of interest to silent film fans and students, filmed with attention to detail: lighting, framing, acting, camera movement. A film of lasting quality.Watch the two films and you will see the change in De MIlle. You will also see a De Mille you might not have known.",5,The Decline of Cecil B.

She is doomed to pay for her actions. When attempting to flee a traffic stop, she causes the death of the officer. The trial brings to light her previous bribes to officers and she is sentenced to 3 to 7 years with the maid she sent to prison not long before. There she learns the error of her ways and secures the man she should have been with all along (Thomas Meighan).This movie is a heavy-handed morality play with director Cecil B. DeMille's signature ancient orgy scenes. It is certainly entertaining, but its overt persuasive tactics are transparent to today's audiences, so the cautionary tale comes off as more of a comedy than a drama. The assertion that the women in prison are kind to each other and teach each other the meaning of forgiveness is downright laughable.The Cheat holds up better. One of DeMille's better films, it is about a greedy woman (Fannie Ward) who invests money from a Red Cross charity drive into a company that goes bust. Her husband (Jack Dean) has been working to raise funds for his money-hungry wife, but his investments don't pay off until it is too late for her. She goes to a friend (Sessue Hayakawa) who turns out to be less-than-amicable; he lends her the money under the condition that she become his property. He brands her with his seal, causing her to shoot him. Her husband comes to the rescue and takes the blame for her actions.Hayakawa is appropriately sinister and aggressive. Ward plays the greedy, pretty wife using subtle emotions fit for the movie screen, but in times of crisis she gives way to the more stereotypical stage gestures silent films are known for. Dean is a sweet man, handsome enough and very likable.The print is average. There are plenty of artifacts that could have been fixed. However, the print does not hinder the scenery, especially the gorgeous shots of the Japanese garden.
