Again, there is no way to see what the shows are about and what guest stars are the show until you go through each one, which tedious and time consuming. I would of preferred that this be in one volume, and they should not charge more money for that since it's one season. Again, the show is a 5 but the issues bring it down. I understand these shows are older, but they can do better cleaning or editing job, if they wanted, considering that MOD sets are quite high.
