Petrucelli,"[0, 0]","It's exactly what you think it is: Funny, stale, risqu&eacute; (and not-so-funny and hot so stale and not so risqu&eacute;) jokes, backed with Klezmer music, told by elderly men and women of the Jewish faith. What makes these 55 minutes so fascinating is that the joke tellers are not pros, but rather doctors, lawyers, salespeople-you know, just like your Uncle Mort and Aunt Fannie. Some of the jokers have such mesmerizing mannerisms and bouncy styles that they could go onto show-biz careers.

The format is to have seemingly ordinary people tell their favorite jokes -- generally the sort of joke that has ""Jewish humor,"" such as explained by Rabbi Joseph Telushkin in his book ""Jewish Humor.""  By the way, I highly recommend that book as well.One can see that most of these folks are not professionals.  You can tell when the scene has been reshot and different takes are combined to be smoother.  But the jokes are funny and the whole concept is delightful.  Some of them are familiar, others were new to me, and a few had me laughing so hard I had to press the pause button.For those who enjoy this sort of humor I recommend it.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[13, 13]","If ever there was a film (though this is really a digitally shot video) whose title told it like it is, this is it.  For 44 minutes you watch, and hear, 16 men and two women - all Jewish and ""moderately"" old - telling jokes. Some tell a couple so there are 38 jokes in all. The only issue is whether the storytellers are ""old"". ""Old is a relative term and most of the participants - each of who stands before an unseen small (based on the laughter) audience while a white curtain acts as scenery. Most are between 65 and 70 years old with the eldest being 75.Think of this as ""Comedy Night at your local synagogue"". None are professionals but they have a good deadpan delivery. Some of the jokes hit you about 10 seconds after you hear the drum thud at the end. And many are REALLY funny. A few of the storytellers (there are short funny stories as well as one-two jokes) cover other ethnicities (Italians, for one) but most are the Jews laughing at themselves. There are quite a few ""risqu&eacute;"" ones and private parts are often described so don't play this in front of your young kids. (They probably wouldn't get the joke anyway).There are no real Special Features. There is a ""find a joke"" option - which is just the Chapter index and a ""hear a new joke"" option, which just displays a web site where you can hear more.It is a lot of fun and makes a great gift for that parent or relative for a birthday or holiday.
