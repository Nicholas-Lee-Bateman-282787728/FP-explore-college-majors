915255,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B0009X75A6,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[15, 15]","It's funny people should mention how much The Doctor and the Devils feels somewhat like a Hammer film, to which I would agree, but it's not really surprising given the director, Freddie Francis, actually made a couple of films for Hammer studios back in the mid to late 60s, including The Evil of Frankenstein (1964) and Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1968).  Based on a screenplay by Dylan Thomas, adapted by Ronald Harwood (The Pianist, Being Julia), the film stars a pre-Bond Timothy Dalton (Flash Gordon, The Living Daylights, The Rocketeer), along with Jonathan Pryce (Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen), and Stephen Rea (The Crying Game, V for Vendetta).  Also appearing is famous 60s model Twiggy (The Blues Brothers, Club Paradise), Julian Sands (Gothic, Warlock), Phyllis Logan (Secrets & Lies), Sin Phillips (Clash of the Titans, Dune), and everyone's favorite bald headed mutant leader/starship captain (the one who doesn't wear a hairpiece), Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: Generations, Conspiracy Theory, X-Men).The story, set in the 19th century, features Dalton as Doctor Thomas Rock, a teacher of anatomy in a prominent London medical school.  Seems Dr. Rock has a problem in getting the teaching materials necessary to conduct his lectures...and by teaching materials, I mean fresh corpses.  You see, back in the day it was believed that after death, one needed all his (or her) parts in order to appease Saint Peter and gain passage through the Pearly Gates, so much so the only corpses allowed for use in such manner, by law, were those of convicted criminals executed by the gooberment, the thinking being, I guess, that is if someone was heinous and deserving enough to be executed, there was no question as to the destination of their departed soul.  Well, turns out that method doesn't produce nearly enough bodies, so Dr. Rock, in the interest of knowledge and the overall betterment of mankind, has to resort to unscrupulous means to get what he needs, paying grave robbers for their services...three sovereigns for an old body, and seven for a fresh one.  Two local sleazebags named Fallon (Pryce) and Broom (Rea) get wind of this, decide they want a piece of the action, and begin supplying Rock with the freshest corpses they can find, so fresh, in fact, they're still warm...if you get my drift.  Anyway, as the boys get greedier (and more careless) and Rock continues to turn a blind eye towards his recent windfall of the freshest cadavers money can buy, his peers are concerned with his practices, and the authorities are getting closer to discovering the cause of the recent decrease in the population in Pig's Lane (where Fallon and Broom reside and begin plying their new trade).While I did enjoy this film, I enjoyed it more when it was originally released in 1945 titled The Body Snatcher featuring Boris Karloff (incidentally, that film was just recently released onto DVD, along with the 1943 film I Walked with a Zombie).  All the performances were very good, but I couldn't help wonder how the movie would have fared with Stewart, who was cast as Dr. Rock's peer and most outspoken critic, in Dalton's role.  Also, I kinda had a hard time buying off on Twiggy as a lower class streetwalker...I mean really, despite the effort to `grubby' her up, she still stood out against the filthy rabble her character was supposed to associate with...my favorite performances were those by Pryce and Rea as the two, despicable, opportunistic lowlifes who are more than happy to supply the doctor with what he needs if it means some coin in their pockets and gin in their bellies (the lower classes seems to spend an awful amount of time consuming alcohol, but given their lives, it's no surprise they'd want to drown their perpetual miseries in the drink).  My favorite scene was when Broom realized his colleague liked his particular role in their new business venture just a wee bit too much, and thought it wise to part company.  Overall I thought the story strong, but perhaps a bit more complicated than it needed to be...especially in terms of Dr. Rock's sister Annabella (Phillips) and his wife Elizabeth (Logan).  The character of the sister did sort of figure peripherally in Rock's eventual outcome, but both these characters felt supercilious and only drew away from the core plot, in my opinion.  I would have preferred the story a bit more stripped down, focusing more on the key characters, rather than spreading itself as widely as it did, which only served to water down some of roles I thought should have been more prominent, like that of Stewart and even Sands.  I also wish Dalton's character had been expanded on more, as it was it felt like he spent much of the time harping on the barbarism within the medical profession, the unnecessarily strict confines placed on him and his peers by the gooberment, and how the means justify the ends.  I was expecting a little more reaction, perhaps more of sense of his own accountability, towards the end when he finally came to terms with how those within his employ were obtaining that which he needed...ah well, these are just my thoughts, and it seems like I'm bashing quite a bit on the movie, but as I said before, I did enjoy it overall.  One really superior element in the film is the overall gothic feel and the detailed set pieces throughout.  The story is thoroughly immersed in the 19th century, from the buildings, the props, and the wonderful costumes, populated by a highly professional cast, and featured a strong, slightly extraneous, sense of direction.The picture quality on this DVD is excellent, and features both the fullscreen, along with the anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) formats.  The Dolby Digital surround audio comes through clean and clear, crackling with life.  As far as special features there's an original theatrical trailer, along with trailers for other films like The Alligator People (1959), The Fly (1958), and Phantom of the Paradise (1974), none of which are even remotely related to this film, other than the fact they were all released by Fox.Cookieman108",4,"""I admit to breaking any law that inhibits the progess of science.""",1128643200,"10

McCarthy ""Two Degrees In Be-Bop, A Ph...","[0, 0]","Although The Doctor And The Devils isn't bottom-of-the-barrel bad, and has a terrific cast, it pales considerably when compared toThe Flesh And The Fiends.  Based on the infamous Burke and Hare case, The Flesh And The Fiends is more historically accurate and names the characters after their real-life counterparts. Set in the early 1800's, the plot revolves around a British medical college's need for fresh corpses to use in anatomical classes for practice, in short supply due to superstition and religious beliefs . When William Burke (George Rose) and William Hare (Donald Pleasence, deliciously evil) become aware that Dr. Alexander Knox (the iconic Peter Cushing) is willing to pay for fresh bodies, well, you can guess the rest. Throughout it's history the film as been censored, butchered, released under various other titles (MANIA, The Fiendish Ghouls) and until this release only available on home video in horrid public domain prints. Peppered with excellent British character actors, the shadowy black and white cinematography in widescreen Dyaliscope lends itself well to the menace and evil that ensue. Directed and co-written by Hammer stalwart John Gilling (The Pirates Of Blood River,The Reptile,The Plague of the Zombies,The Mummy's Shroud), the film has a surprising depth of character.  Disturbingly vicious violence, occasional flashes of VERY dark humour and a palpable sexual depravity, especially in the tavern scenes (including a surprising amount of nudity for a 1959 release), makes this a no-no for the kiddies!  An unsurprising denouement is the only time the film strays from it's historic precedents, but it's shocks can not top what proceeds.

Francis was best known as a cinematographer (and won two Oscars in that capacity), but he was no slouch in the directors' chair, either; he contributed to some of Britain's most enduring horror flicks over the years, including Day of the Triffids and Dr. Terror's House of Horrors. This is a bit lower-key than his usual excursions into horror, and that is not at all a bad thing.Based loosely on the tale of Burke and Hare, The Doctor and the Devils revolves around Dr. Rock (Timothy Dalton), a rather unpopular anatomist who is convinced he can cure all the world's ills as long as he has enough raw material to experiment with. A noble sentiment, to be sure, but it does lead his ""assistants"", the grave robbers Fallon (Jonathan Pryce) and Broom (Stephen Rea), to resort to more extreme measures in order to find a steady supply of bodies. Meanwhile, Rock's eager assistant Murray (Julian Sands) is learning that being a doctor is all about treating the whole patient--something he seems especially eager to do with a streetwalker named Jennie (Twiggy).Dalton, Pryce, and Rea all turn in very good performances, and the rest of the cast support them quite nicely; this is a film that is crowded with good performances. Francis does a fine turn as a director here as well, and the whole thing gels quite nicely. This one has unjustly faded into obscurity over the quarter-century since its release; like many of the mid-eighties gothic horror flicks that came out around this time, these days it qualifies as a hidden gem. If you find a dusty copy on your video store shelf, it's well worth checking out. *** ",4,"Dylan Thomas + Freddie Francis + Burke and Hare + Sam Lowry + Prince Barin = a fun, fun movie",1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,1854,"['Doctor', 'Devils', 'Freddie', 'Francis', '1985', 'Dylan', 'Thomas', 'classic', 'script', 'written', 'thirty-two', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'reworked', 'Ronald', 'Harwood', 'interim', 'all-star', 'treatment', 'Francis', '1985', 'telling', 'tale', 'Francis', 'was', 'best', 'known', 'cinematographer', 'won', 'two', 'Oscars', 'capacity', 'was', 'slouch', 'directors', 'chair', 'either', 'contributed', 'Britain', 'most', 'enduring', 'horror', 'flicks', 'years', 'including', 'Day', 'Triffids', 'Dr.', 'Terror', 'House', 'Horrors', 'bit', 'lower-key', 'usual', 'excursions', 'horror', 'not', 'bad', 'thing.Based', 'loosely', 'tale', 'Burke', 'Hare', 'Doctor', 'Devils', 'Dr.', 'Rock', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'rather', 'unpopular', 'anatomist', 'who', 'convinced', 'can', 'cure', 'world', 'ills', 'as', 'long', 'enough', 'raw', 'material', 'experiment', 'noble', 'sentiment', 'be', 'sure', 'lead', 'assistants', 'grave', 'robbers', 'Fallon', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'Broom', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'resort', 'more', 'extreme', 'measures', 'order', 'find', 'steady', 'supply', 'bodies', 'Meanwhile', 'Rock', 'eager', 'assistant', 'Murray', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'learning', 'being', 'doctor', 'treating', 'whole', 'patient', 'something', 'especially', 'eager', 'do', 'streetwalker', 'named', 'Jennie', 'Twiggy', '.Dalton', 'Pryce', 'Rea', 'turn', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'rest', 'cast', 'support', 'quite', 'nicely', 'film', 'crowded', 'good', 'performances', 'Francis', 'fine', 'turn', 'director', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'whole', 'thing', 'gels', 'quite', 'nicely', 'one', 'unjustly', 'faded', 'obscurity', 'quarter-century', 'release', 'many', 'mid-eighties', 'gothic', 'horror', 'flicks', 'came', 'out', 'time', 'days', 'hidden', 'gem', 'find', 'dusty', 'copy', 'video', 'store', 'shelf', 'well', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', '***']",N/A
