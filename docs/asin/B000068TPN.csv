I see the war as a wound we refused to let close.  How many NVA soldiers died horrible, slow, bloody painful deaths?  How many of them had families?  In this film, they mostly all die offscreen.  When they're on screen, they usually perish while jumping from a huge explosion.  The Vietnamese commander is about as distant and trivial as possible.  More time is spent trying to establish an emotional connection with the CO's Wife.  What? And that's where this movie goes wrong.  It conveys chaos, maybe, but not fear.  The Thin Red Line, despite it's long running time (similar to this film) is much more effective in letting the audience develop a connection with the main characters and in showing why they act.  We Were Soldiers simply shows men getting slaughtered and trying to remain patriotic/hopeful until the end of the flick.  and what a TERRIBLE score.",3,"""heroes""",1064793600,"09 29, 2003",2003,988,"['American', 'Heroes', 'guess', 'sums', 'up', 'movie', 'celebrate', 'blood', 'spilled', 'pointless', 'struggle', 'see', 'war', 'wound', 'refused', 'let', 'close', 'How', 'many', 'NVA', 'soldiers', 'died', 'horrible', 'slow', 'bloody', 'painful', 'deaths', 'How', 'many', 'had', 'families', 'film', 'mostly', 'die', 'offscreen', 'When', ""'re"", 'screen', 'usually', 'perish', 'jumping', 'huge', 'explosion', 'Vietnamese', 'commander', 'distant', 'trivial', 'possible', 'More', 'time', 'spent', 'trying', 'establish', 'emotional', 'connection', 'CO', 'Wife', 'What', 'where', 'movie', 'wrong', 'chaos', 'maybe', 'not', 'fear', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'long', 'running', 'time', 'similar', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'letting', 'audience', 'develop', 'connection', 'main', 'characters', 'showing', 'why', 'act', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'simply', 'men', 'getting', 'slaughtered', 'trying', 'remain', 'patriotic/hopeful', 'end', 'flick', 'what', 'TERRIBLE', 'score']",N/A

I had high hopes for this movie, but even before seeing it I started hearing rumblings from Vietnam vets who saw it and were tremendously disappointed.

It begins in 1954 when a French patrol is attacked and defeated in a surprise ambush. A prophecy for the future? In one scene a wounded French soldier is killed. [Was this truth or drama?] Then in 1964 we see children in a car singing a tune based on ""Sambre et Meuse"", which dates to the Napoleonic Wars. Next we see a training camp where helicopters will be used in ground battles. [Wasn't this an adaption of a civilian model?] One scene shows officer's wives discussing local conditions and the laundromat. [Are the defective washing machines at the camp a symbol of failure?] One scene recalls Custer's last battle. Custer did not know the size of the enemy; he assumed about 2,500 and not three times as many. Later we hear the Intelligence officer admit they did not know the size of the enemy forces. Ominous?The mechanized cavalry lands in their helicopters, the soldiers start shooting. Some soldiers run after a lone enemy and are ambushed. The battle erupts in fierce fighting. Two helicopters bring in needed ammunition. Back in the states telegrams arrive with bad news for the families. Were they delivered impersonally? The battle continues with rising casualties on both sides. Air support arrives to drop napalm. Some lands too far from the enemy. They expect another attack at dawn. But the tide has turned, the enemy faces defeat and withdraws. The end of the battle shows a load of journalists arriving to take pictures and question the colonel. After the Seventh Cavalry is withdrawn the Vietnamese reclaim their land. The Colonel returns to his family in his land.In 1964 General Douglas MacArthur advised LBJ against getting into a land war in Asia.

As the film ended and the lights grew to a glow, the packed audience sat still and paid respectful homage as the fallen soldiers names appeared on the screen. Some around me could barely contain themselves as they shook and cried. Veterans and soldiers in military uniform humbly and quitly remained in their seats long after I left the room. It was amazing to see all of these strangers who had come together to see a movie, suddenly seem to be a part of something special and real. It reminded me of when I first saw Private Ryan a few years back, and saw the same reaction. People who had been arguing and behaving rudely before the movie, were now leaving proudly, holding the door open for the next person. It takes something special to do that. Like Blackhawk Down, We Were Soldier's comes at a time of heightened patriotism and valor. When life has a little more meaning, and when Americans dive deeper within themselves to find an extra emotion of strength to get through the day. What seperates We Were Soldiers from other great Vietnam films such as Platoon, was the effort to show both sides of the war. A Northern Vietnamese soldier, writing in his journal and staring at the photograph of his wife, as at the same time an American soldier is also dwelling on thought's of home. Before American's, The North Vietnamese army had fought the Chinese, and French...

I've heard it said that this is one of the better war movies, and one of the best Viet Nam movies. I'd have to agree. Mel Gibson puts in a stunning performance (as usual) at Col Hal Moore, the leader of the 1st battallion, 7th calvary (Custer's unit). Greg Kinnear has a great performance. Barry Pepper does a wonderful job as Joe Galloway, the reporter who was there in the fight. And it is great to see Sam Elliot again, in a role that seems tailor made for him. And many other actors put in great performances. It may have helped that Hal Moore, Joe Galloway, and Bruce Crandall (Kinnear's character) were there to help guide the filmmakers. This movie also spends time focussing on the soldier's wives at home, where Madeleine Stowe and especially Keri Russell and Simbi Khali (not much screen time for Khali, but the few minutes she was on, she was phenomenal) do a great job. You don't too often see the effect at home, but you do here. We Were Soldiers also portrays the enemy as soldiers and honorable men, instead of the stereotypical '...' shown in most Viet Nam movies. And as much as I like movies like Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, and Casualties of War, it is nice to see the soldiers portrayed as soldiers doing their job rather than the psychos, drug addicts, and the likes shown in other movies. This is what Speilberg was hoping for when he made Saving Private Ryan. Randall Wallace (writer/director) teams up again with Gibson. These guys made Braveheart together, and We Were Soldiers is almost as good. The effects are good, and William Hoy does such a great job editing, I think he deserves an Oscar. Nick Glennie-Smith scored the movie, and his work doesn't detract, nor is it swallowed up by the action. This is just an overall great movie.And the dvd is a good one also. There is a commentary track by Wallace, and while it isn't the most entertaining I've watched, he does a good job (I do wish Mel Gibson had been on the track with him).

705630,AK2Q7ML2RANDN,B000068TPN,A. Eby,"[5, 7]","I was very impressed with ""We Were Soldiers"", the story of the first major conflict between American soldiers and the Vietcong.  The film, written for the screen and directed by Randall Wallace, and starring Mel Gibson in one of his best roles ever, is an unconventional look at war, especially the Vietnam War.  Rejecting the ambiguity and claustrophobic horror of such classics as ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Platoon"", it presents an almost worshipful look at the American soldier, sure, but it gives us a reason to label these men heroes.  It is a simple, but poignant, glance into the brotherhood of soldiers as they fight to stay alive in the midst of absolute horror.  ""We Were Soldiers"" shows that war is hell, but it doesn't lose itself in it.  The benefit of 30+ years has allowed filmmakers to look back on this horrific period in history with some perspective.  What I like about ""We Were Soldiers"" is that it doesn't even attempt to justify our presence in Vietnam, but it vilifies no one.  The Vietcong are presented as men who believe in what they're doing as much as the Americans, if not more.  This might be one of the first films to attempt to provide an objective view of the ""enemy"".  It was refreshing; there's been enough propaganda in the media.  I'm tired of being told how to feel about Vietnam.  ""We Were Soldiers"" takes the viewer right into the middle of combat, in a manner similar to ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down"".  The bullets whiz past OUR heads, the screams of the wounded and dying fill OUR ears, the heat of the explosions burns US.  Randall Wallace's direction is very evocative; I found myself trying to slink down like the actors.  Speaking of actors, this film has got some good ones.  Mel Gibson is superb as Col. Hal Moore; he embodied the role like he was born to play it.  Barry Pepper, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, and others were similarly outstanding.  I also appreciated the portrait of Army wives; the sequence in which Madeleine Stowe (Moore's wife) and Keri Russell (Chris Klein's wife) hand-deliver death-announcement telegrams to the wives is devastating.  There are some standard war movie cliches in ""We Were Soldiers"", but overall, I thought it was an impressive achievement.

705634,A1A87TUBBDPMF0,B000068TPN,"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer""","[17, 20]","We Were Soldiers, Randall Wallace's 2002 feature film about the three-day Battle of the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam, is perhaps the best Hollywood depiction of America's ""lost crusade"" in Indochina.Based on Lt. Gen. Harold B. Moore and Joseph Galloway's non-fiction book We Were Soldiers Once....and Young, Wallace's film version is a realistic and respectful account of the first major battle between U.S. and North Vietnamese forces in November of 1965.Starring Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Hal Moore, We Were Soldiers begins with the Vietnamese destruction of France's Mobile Group 100 in 1954, the same year that Diem Bien Phu fell and French involvement in Vietnam ended, paving the way for America's long and doomed intervention.  This opening scene is graphically violent yet serves to drive home its point - to show the determination of the Vietnamese to drive off any outside force, even if it means being ruthless.We Were Soldiers, unlike Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now or Oliver Stone's Platoon, portrays its soldiers realistically and without the anti-military post-Vietnam War bitterness that permeates those two films.  (To be fair, both Coppola and Stone's movies are well made, and in the case of Apocalypse Now, that film is not really about Vietnam per se but rather a Vietnamized adaptation of Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness.)  Some viewers might even accuse Wallace (who wrote and directed) of having a right-wing revisionist slant, but in the featurette on the making of the movie, he points out that he was inspired to do We Were Soldiers when he read Hal Moore's comment that Hollywood has never gotten it right when it comes to making movies about the Vietnam War.We Were Soldiers not only has respect and admiration for the U.S. soldiers, but it also depicts the bravery and sacrifice of the Vietnamese People's Army.  True, most of the focus is on the American troops and, unusually for a Vietnam combat movie, their families.  But I personally have not seen the North Vietnamese portrayed with this much respect in a movie - even though I know Oliver Stone's Heaven and Earth is a movie that deals with the Vietnamese.Mel Gibson portrays Lt. Col. Moore with his usual earnestness, wit and warmth.  He allows us to see the human side to this very intellectual and dedicated soldier.  He is not only a very pensive officer who reads French history books about Vietnam and has various college degrees, but also a loving husband and father.  His scenes with Madeline Stowe, who plays his wife Julie, exude affection and true chemistry.  Also, the scene when Moore explains the concept of war to his youngest daughter is touching and tender. Rounding out the cast are Sam Elliott, Barry Pepper, Keri Russell, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, and American Pie's Jason Biggs.The depiction of the battle at Landing Zone X-ray ranks among the best, if sometimes grueling, war scenes.  The movie captures the horrible yet mesmerizing spectacle of battle, taking audiences from the roller-coaster exhilaration of nap of the earth helicopter rides to a three-day life-or-death struggle between two determined bands of fighting men.Paramount's Widescreen Collection DVD is, as can be expected, a basic offering in comparison to other studios' releases.  Admittedly, the root menu is flashier than previous DVDs from Paramount, and it does have director's commentary, two different Dolby sound settings, and the aforementioned making-of featurette.",4,"We Were Soldiers is a moving, human film",1054425600,"06 1, 2003",2003,3464,"['Were', 'Soldiers', 'Randall', 'Wallace', '2002', 'feature', 'film', 'three-day', 'Battle', 'Ia', 'Drang', 'Valley', 'Vietnam', 'perhaps', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'depiction', 'America', 'lost', 'crusade', 'Indochina.Based', 'Lt.', 'Gen.', 'Harold', 'B.', 'Moore', 'Joseph', 'Galloway', 'non-fiction', 'book', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'Once', '.and', 'Young', 'Wallace', 'film', 'version', 'realistic', 'respectful', 'account', 'first', 'major', 'battle', 'U.S.', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'forces', 'November', '1965.Starring', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Hal', 'Moore', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'begins', 'Vietnamese', 'destruction', 'France', 'Mobile', 'Group', '100', '1954', 'same', 'year', 'Diem', 'Bien', 'Phu', 'fell', 'French', 'involvement', 'Vietnam', 'ended', 'paving', 'way', 'America', 'long', 'doomed', 'intervention', 'opening', 'scene', 'graphically', 'violent', 'yet', 'drive', 'home', 'point', 'show', 'determination', 'Vietnamese', 'drive', 'off', 'outside', 'force', 'even', 'being', 'ruthless.We', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Platoon', 'soldiers', 'realistically', 'anti-military', 'post-Vietnam', 'War', 'bitterness', 'two', 'films', 'be', 'fair', 'Coppola', 'Stone', 'movies', 'are', 'well', 'made', 'case', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'Vietnam', 'per', 'se', 'rather', 'Vietnamized', 'adaptation', 'Joseph', 'Conrad', 'novel', 'Heart', 'Darkness', 'viewers', 'might', 'even', 'accuse', 'Wallace', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'having', 'right-wing', 'revisionist', 'slant', 'featurette', 'making', 'movie', 'out', 'was', 'inspired', 'do', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'when', 'read', 'Hal', 'Moore', 'comment', 'Hollywood', 'never', 'gotten', 'right', 'when', 'making', 'movies', 'Vietnam', 'War.We', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'not', 'only', 'respect', 'admiration', 'U.S.', 'soldiers', 'also', 'bravery', 'sacrifice', 'Vietnamese', 'People', 'Army', 'True', 'most', 'focus', 'American', 'troops', 'unusually', 'Vietnam', 'combat', 'movie', 'families', 'personally', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'portrayed', 'much', 'respect', 'movie', 'even', 'know', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Heaven', 'Earth', 'movie', 'deals', 'Vietnamese.Mel', 'Gibson', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Moore', 'usual', 'earnestness', 'wit', 'warmth', 'see', 'human', 'side', 'very', 'intellectual', 'dedicated', 'soldier', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'pensive', 'officer', 'who', 'French', 'history', 'books', 'Vietnam', 'various', 'college', 'degrees', 'also', 'loving', 'husband', 'father', 'scenes', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', 'who', 'wife', 'Julie', 'exude', 'affection', 'true', 'chemistry', 'Also', 'scene', 'when', 'Moore', 'concept', 'war', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'touching', 'tender', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'are', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'American', 'Pie', 'Jason', 'Biggs.The', 'depiction', 'battle', 'Landing', 'Zone', 'X-ray', 'ranks', 'best', 'sometimes', 'grueling', 'war', 'scenes', 'movie', 'horrible', 'yet', 'mesmerizing', 'spectacle', 'battle', 'taking', 'audiences', 'roller-coaster', 'exhilaration', 'nap', 'earth', 'helicopter', 'rides', 'three-day', 'life-or-death', 'struggle', 'two', 'determined', 'bands', 'fighting', 'men.Paramount', 'Widescreen', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'basic', 'offering', 'comparison', 'other', 'studios', 'releases', 'Admittedly', 'root', 'menu', 'flashier', 'previous', 'DVDs', 'Paramount', 'have', 'director', 'commentary', 'two', 'different', 'Dolby', 'sound', 'settings', 'aforementioned', 'making-of', 'featurette']",N/A

It's hard to not think of it as cliche and redundant.Some say this film is similar to Blackhawk Down.  In a way, it is.  In other ways, it's unique.

It recognizes the sacrifices that not only the soldiers themselves make when they go fight a war, but also the pain and suffering their wives and children undergo with the absense and loss of them.  This film pays tribute to the soldiers (who were strongly outnumbered and out-experienced) who died fighting a 3 day war in Vietnam .We Were Soldiers describes the war from two points of view.

It's the harrowing story of a vastly outnumbered and green 7th Cavalry unit choppered into the field on what quickly becomes a suicide mission.They engage an enemy with 20 years fighting experience that also has the geographical advantage of high ground entrenchment. Reporter/fotog Joe Galloway choppers in just before the worst fighting begins and ends up battling for his life.On 11/15/65, Col. Moore (Gibson) radios a ""Broken Arrow"" distress call when his troops are being overwhelmed by sheer numbers and it looks like they'll all get slaughtered just as French forces were a decade earlier. The American response is immediate and decisive. Machine gun fire from helicopter warships in co-ordination with accurate artillery barrages turn the tide of battle and decimate the NVA.This most graphic of all 'Nam films has a solid hour of horrendous battles that intercut occasionally with scenes of the pressures wives back home must cope with.

I leave it up to the reader to decide if any sane, reasonable person would find anything offensive about what was said here.]Vietnam -- It's Legacy, It's Lessons for Us Today, 25 May 2005This film touched my heart in the way it showed the valor, the commitment, the utter devotion and supreme dedication of those whose awful task it was to go to Vietnam and suffer and die, or suffer and live (in many cases a fate worse than death), all for nothing.Well, it wasn't exactly for nothing, was it?. Many made fortunes off that war, and it is the contrast of the dedication of these great patriots, misguided and downright misled though they were, with the behind-the-scenes corruption and greed that used Communism as an excuse to wage a no-win war at the expense of human life that I wish to address.I must say the movie did a good job in portraying just how awful it was to have to endure all that over there in Vietnam, and it gave me a new respect for those who went through it all.Frankly, I didn't make it past the first jungle scene or two before I had to switch off. I couldn't bear to watch all that suffering and dying... all in vain. I was looking at this story of the war in Vietnam with hindsight, since I knew how it was going to end, and my heart groaned over that waste of human life that was going to accomplish nothing good.We were never meant to win.Vietnam stank of Machiavellianism on an international scale.Nicolo Machiavelli was a sub-human parasite. He was a master at profiting from wars and disputes between peoples. If there was no conflict going at the moment he would try to instigate one, and then pretend to befriend both sides behind both their backs. By controlling the purse strings he could keep each side from getting too dominant and annihilating the other, thereby destroying that side's ability to pay off the war debt and also keeping the conflict alive as long as possible. Can we see any resemblance to the Vietnam war here? People back here at home smelled a rat and hated the war. Maybe they couldn't put their finger on the problem, but they knew something was deeply wrong. There was some talk about America having lost her resolve to make the world safe for democracy. Why should the world's greatest power not be able to bring a two-bit country like North Vietnam to its knees, they wanted to know, and couldn't articulate why not.It wasn't about resolve, it was about money, and sacrificing human life to feed the economy and line the pockets of the ones who stood to gain at the expense of our fighting men's very lives.The problem is that some of those people who opposed the war also hated our own soldiers for participating in the war. It is in the honor of those valiant men that this review is dedicated. They were patriots and should never have been mistreated by their own, no matter how misguided or exploited they were. They didn't question, they just obeyed. They followed orders, as they were taught to do.I can't speak for the Army of today, but I can tell you about how it was back in the sixties. Independent thought was discouraged. You were taught to follow orders without question. Military life may always be so. It always has been, that's for sure. I remember one of the Dirty Dozen movies where there was a mission given the dozen to kill some general who planned to assassinate Hitler. The sharpshooter had the general in his sights but the problem was that Hitler was there too, and he thought Hitler made a better target. I remember Lee Marvin's character saying several times,""Just the general"".He knew that the higher ups in America wanted Hitler alive so he could keep on making his strategic blunders and keep on losing the war for his country. But would Marvin's character confide that to his sniper underling? Not on your life. Just obey orders and do not ask questions was his approach to command.When I took an oath upon joining the Army I remember I had to sign a paper giving up my rights under the Constitution of the United States of America, especially that of free speech. We were ushered into another room after the swearing-in where it was explained to us that we were now property of the U.S. Army. ""GI"" stands for government issue. You became a part of the weapons arsenal, with your own serial number, even. The power and control that is exerted over you is deep and intense. It is hard to imagine what pressure these men who went to Vietnam were subjected to in order to get them to fight this awful war.All I can say for those poor, blind, and misguided souls who fought in Vietnam is may God bless them, both living and dead. I deeply appreciate their unselfish devotion to their country and to the oath they swore.But also, may God curse those who exploited them so they could become rich. A curse on them and all that their filthy blood-soaked money ever built.And a curse on all those who would repeat that abuse today --or in the future.But let us not forget that we are supposed to be a government of, by, and for the people. In America, the government derives its power to govern from those governed. If we have let our country become a government of the people, by the politicians, for the special interest groups, if we refuse to discharge our obligation to remain ever vigilant over those whom we elect to run our country, then will the blood of those who fought and died (or else survived, broken and traumatized) not be on our heads as well?",5,"Vietnam -- It's Legacy, It's Lessons for Us

It is a terrific period piece in the sense that it captures the essence of a now long-gone spirit of concern and empathy that older and compassionate senior officers had for their soldiers. Mel Gibson seems to be aging very well as evidenced by his wonderful characterization of Lt. Col. Harold Moore, a career Army officer who lives both fully and well, but who is at the same time also totally devoted and committed to meet the responsibility he's entrusted with in terms of the welfare of his officers and men.The movie, based on the historical fact of the first large scale engagement by American soldiers with the regular North Vietnamese Army (NVA), as opposed to the clashes with the guerilla-style Viet Cong later on, traces the extensive training and preparation of the regiment in the experimental use of helicopters to transport soldiers rapidly into enemy-held areas. The risks associated with this new style of tactical warfare quickly becomes apparent; eight to ten serial efforts are required to fully mobilize the unit, and the men first dropped find themselves dangerously exposed in the event a vastly superior enemy force engages. Of course, this is exactly what happens, and the brutal exchange that then ensues is the backdrop for the movie.Over a period of some five days, the encircled American forces lose almost half their personnel, yet are able to kill more than 1,800 of the attacking Vietnamese soldiers. Seen in the cold light of day, this exchange becomes a de-facto documentary on the inherent risks of combat, and the quicksilver nature of modern warfare. The cast helps here, for veterans like Sam Elliot (as the Sgt. Rock-like Sergeant Major) and Barry Pepper (as the UPI reporter who forges a life-long friendship with Wallace and helps to write the book) add to the sense of gritty reality the film captures so well. Madeline Stowe is also very good as the enduring wife of the Colonel who also acts to lead the women of the organization in the men's absence. Like another recent movie, ""Black Hawk Down"", this film helps to de-mystify modern warfare without glorifying or judging it. This is a wonderful film, and one I heartily recommend.

The only problem I have with this movie is I can not figure out what he has to say even when he tells you. With the probable exception of ""All Quiet on the Western front"", most war movies just use war as a back drop to their main purpose as in ""Apocalypse Now"" (an updated ""Hart of Darkness""). This movie has the look and feel of an updated ""Green Berets"" Pluck out John Wayne and plug in Mel.We know the base story is of the stand off of the NVA at Ia Drang November 1965 against overwhelming odds, with a little help of superior technology. The uniforms and equipment look pretty authentic. The terrain was well done also; it could be the real thing as much as California. Not all of Vietnam is swamp.Even though there is a lot of action (more phosphorus than C4) this is not just a shootemup movie. They also focused on the wives back home, showing how they had to cope with the situation. There were also some cursory sub stories as a combat photographer getting more than he expected.I have the same conundrum as others do that have not been there. The Vietnam I was in (67-68) had a few firefights; but most of the time it was our spies against their spies and there was no front. When we tangled both sides lost an even average of 15% but if you could find them and drop something on them you got your 15% from a safe distance. I was in the special reactionaries and trained for just the situation this movie depicts. I was the RTO and was supposed to fight out and retake the base to not let the NVA get a foot hold.

Outnumbered on the field and backed by the politically driven Defense Department of the time, one battalion finds itself outnumbered and fighting for its life in the jungles of Vietnam.A recent reviewer here mistook what this movie was about. It is NOT about America's war in Vietnam and all the ideology behind it. Its about a battle that occurred in the early years of that war between a new type of specialized fighting unit and a very determined enemy. America wanted to engage the enemy for the first time and this is the battle. The only politics involved here is the decision not to declare a National Emergency thus allowing the Army's most experienced soldiers to leave at the end of their enlistments, when ironically they were most needed. This movie is about a battalion commander training his unit, getting orders and shipping off to war. It also gives an excellent look at what the wives had to endure during that terrible time.If one wants to look at the politics of this war, check out HBO'sPath to War. Path to War shows the speech were LBJ sends this unit, the Air Cav, to Vietnam and the political reasoning behind it. It goes through LBJ's escalation and McNamera's change of heart on the winnablity of the war. Highly recommend it.Anyway, in realism this ranks up there with Saving Private Ryan. By reading the book you get a much better grasp of what happened as well as the story not told of what happened at LZ Albany. That encounter was even a worse then what happened at LZ X-Ray.All told this movie gives the feel of how horrible, horrowing and confusing first-hand combat can be. One decision can lead to winning the day, or as the movie shows, getting yourself cut off and most of your men killed. As for accuracy to what occurred, a group of soldiers that were there appeared on The History Channel's ""Hollywood vs History"" program and they concurred that it was 75-80% factual. 20 - 25% Hollywood.

I'll check it out later).  Unlike the horrible, stupid Ben Affleck Pearl Harbor [movie], We Were Soldiers is watchable, moving, and mostly very accurate about the war (maybe 80% true & 20% fiction).  I almost cried during the film...The typical Hollywood ""We American nice, you enemy bad"" black and white boring nonsense is toned down in this movie. (Some movie direcotrs just don't understand that the main characters are only great if the enemy is a worthy opponent)  Of course we still identify with Lt. Col. Moore & American side, but the film sort of give you an idea of what it's like for the other side.Mel Gibson is a good actor as always, this one reminds me of his Braveheart performance (In case you have been living under a rock, Braveheart is also a good flick, if not historically accurate).  The story of We Were Soldiers starts out a bit slow, but in the process you get to understand the character more, not a bad trade off.The war scene is a bit confusing, but that's how the war is supposed to be anyways.  I think the director does the good job conveying what's happening thru Lt. Col. Moore & enemy General's commands & tactics.

Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[3, 3]","WE WERE SOLDIERS is a great war movie that has tense battlefield action as well as tear-jerking moments over the families left behind.The DVD cover should have described this film as the TRUE STORY that it is! That is what makes this movie interesting, it is the TRUE STORY of the first official battle between US troops and North Vietnam Army troops!This is soldier against soldier, both sides wearing their distinctive helmets and uniforms. This is not the typical Hollywood version of evil US troops fighting civilians and the enemy disguised as civilians, (which, come to think of it, is the very problem that we now have with the War on Terror, that the terrorists often disguise themselves as civilians).Sometimes the writing in WE WERE SOLDIERS seems a little corny, cheesy, or melodramatic, but if you listen to the informative Director's Commentary, he explains that most of those moments are directly from the real life book, WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE... AND YOUNG, by the real life main character, played in the film by Mel Gibson.The movie has a lot of very nice, family moments, and there is plenty to like in that the characters all honor traditional family values and wanting  to keep the family together -- but which soldiers will come home again?The Bonus Features add about 40 minutes of interesting documentary and Making Of material, and often it is surprising how similar the final movie version looks compared to the old footage of the characters and places in the story! Many characters seem to be just generic, made up characters, until you watch the Making Of footage and see that most of them are named and based on real life soldiers, and often they even seem to look like the real life people did, too!There is about 20 minutes of Deleted Scenes, which are all good, too. Most of these should have been kept in the film, in my opinion, because they add a lot of good character development.Like most Mel Gibson movies, WE WERE SOLDIERS can get a little graphically violent, but I don't mind as long as they are portraying historical violence in a realistic way. The films that Mel Gibson directs are more intense, as well as historical, like APOCALYPTO, and Mel Gibson's best film, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, but WE WERE SOLDIERS is still very good.Mel Gibson's Apocalypto (Widescreen Edition)The Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition)The film makers did an excellent job of staying true to the material, and this is a very interesting, entertaining, tense, and heartfelt film!",5,A TRUE Story and an Excellent Historical War Movie!,1181520000,"06 11, 2007",2007,2504,"['WE', 'WERE', 'SOLDIERS', 'great', 'war', 'movie', 'tense', 'battlefield', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'tear-jerking', 'moments', 'families', 'left', 'behind.The', 'DVD', 'cover', 'should', 'have', 'described', 'film', 'TRUE', 'STORY', 'what', 'movie', 'interesting', 'TRUE', 'STORY', 'first', 'official', 'battle', 'US', 'troops', 'North', 'Vietnam', 'Army', 'soldier', 'soldier', 'sides', 'wearing', 'distinctive', 'helmets', 'uniforms', 'not', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'evil', 'US', 'troops', 'fighting', 'civilians', 'enemy', 'disguised', 'civilians', 'come', 'think', 'very', 'problem', 'now', 'have', 'War', 'Terror', 'terrorists', 'often', 'disguise', 'civilians', 'writing', 'WE', 'WERE', 'SOLDIERS', 'little', 'corny', 'cheesy', 'melodramatic', 'listen', 'informative', 'Director', 'Commentary', 'most', 'moments', 'are', 'directly', 'real', 'life', 'book', 'WE', 'WERE', 'SOLDIERS', 'ONCE', 'YOUNG', 'real', 'life', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'film', 'Mel', 'Gibson.The', 'movie', 'lot', 'very', 'nice', 'family', 'moments', 'plenty', 'like', 'characters', 'honor', 'traditional', 'family', 'values', 'wanting', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'soldiers', 'will', 'come', 'home', 'again', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'add', '40', 'minutes', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'Making', 'material', 'often', 'surprising', 'how', 'similar', 'final', 'movie', 'version', 'compared', 'old', 'footage', 'characters', 'places', 'story', 'Many', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'just', 'generic', 'made', 'up', 'characters', 'watch', 'Making', 'footage', 'see', 'most', 'are', 'named', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'soldiers', 'often', 'even', 'seem', 'look', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'did', 'too', '20', 'minutes', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'Most', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'kept', 'film', 'opinion', 'add', 'lot', 'good', 'character', 'most', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'movies', 'WE', 'WERE', 'SOLDIERS', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'graphically', 'violent', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'portraying', 'historical', 'violence', 'realistic', 'way', 'films', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'directs', 'are', 'more', 'intense', 'as', 'well', 'historical', 'APOCALYPTO', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'best', 'film', 'PASSION', 'THE', 'CHRIST', 'WE', 'WERE', 'SOLDIERS', 'still', 'very', 'good.Mel', 'Gibson', 'Apocalypto', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'Definitive', 'Edition', 'film', 'makers', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'staying', 'true', 'material', 'very', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'tense', 'heartfelt', 'film']",N/A

It could be beyond enjoyable-a transcendent study of war-but the movie deviates from the book in several significant ways.  As a result it is more of a pre-Iraq Attack propaganda flick.Mel Gibson stars as LTC Hal Moore the commander of a squadron of the 7th Cavalry who first battles the North Vietnamese Army using the US Army's Airmobile Tactics as well as heavy fire support in the Battle of the Ia Drang Valley.The film is a bowdlerized version of The Nam, ignoring the important realities of the war as well as the critical study of the political limitations at the start of escalation that so warped the American effort.  The book is far more frank of this reality.The film also pays surprising homage to contemporary America's civil religion of &#34;diversity.&#34;  Of course, racial tension nearly crippled the US Army in Vietnam and may have contributed to the ultimate defeat of American objectives therein.  This un-necessary but included inversion of reality seems to stem from the current of deliberate denial of diversity's problems that was a major part of the Bush Administration's actions following 9-11.The film also ignores the remainder of the Battle at Ia Drang-in particular the devastating ambush at LZ Albany.Of course, it is only a movie and there are great parts to it.  It does highlight the valor of the Americans in Vietnam, it shows the home front, and the necessary building of trust necessary for successful operations.

705675,A17N23WXA7EAF,B000068TPN,"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[1, 2]","Based on a true story, ""We Were Soldiers"" recounts the first significant engagement between American and Vietnamese soldiers in 1965. In terms of realism and intensity, the battle scenes are truly state-of-the are and easily merit the same encomia as those in ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Saving Private Ryan."" From a human interest perspective, the film does a wonderful job of portraying the anguish of military families who must face the fear and reality of their loved ones dying in battle. And to the film maker's credit they make a significant effort to portray the Vietnamese enemy as good guys who were just doing their thing.Oddly enough, the part of this movie I object to the most is the one that is frequently showcased in trailers and talk shows. In this scene, the protagonist, played by Mel Gibson, is asked by his daughter why people fight wars. He responds that war is what happens when bad men try to hurt other men and men like her daddy try to stop them. With these words, Mel Gibson not only provides his young daughter with an understandably innocent description of warfare in general, he also distills the entire theme of ""We Were Soldiers"" into a single sound byte. Mel Gibson is telling us that the Vietnamese were the bad guys and the Americans were the good guys who were trying to stop them.These lines disturb me when I consider the context in which this film was made. ""We Were Soldiers"" is following the newly blazed trail of neo-war movies that began with films like ""Saving Private Ryan"". This film and the World War II films that followed reversed three decades of objective, analytical war films such as ""Tora Tora Tora"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Platoon"", and ""Casualties of War"" and instead replaced them with a sentimental, jingoistic view of American military action. This was acceptable enough with ""World War II"" because there really isn't too much trouble distinguishing between right and wrong in that event. With ""We Were Soldiers"", however, Hollywood has now attempted to reshape the public's understanding of the Vietnam War along similarly benign and simplistic guidelines.At this point, many readers are probably thinking, ""but this is a true story! How can you possibly state that it is misleading?"" This is a perfectly valid question to which I would respond first that this film is based on a book which is itself misleading in many ways, and second, it is the EXCLUSION of facts that makes this film misleading. ""We Were Soldiers"" presents American troops as benign interventionists in a conflict they new little about. In doing this it excludes some ugly realities about what American presence in Vietnam meant for millions of Vietnamese. To begin, with the U.S. Congress estimates that in the course of the war the United States killed approximately 1,350,000 civilians, by all accounts a highly conservative estimate. In addition, there are numerous well documented instances crimes perpetrated by the American military against Vietnamese civilians including rape, murder, theft, unlawful imprisonment, the destruction of farmland, torture, contamination, and forced prostitution.While ""We Were Soldiers"" is wonderful for all the reasons that an action packed, loosely historical film should be,  it is also problematic. If after seeing this film, you do not want to do some research in the library or online, at least see some films that offer different perspectives of the war. I know that for many of our veterans, unjustly blamed for something that was largely the fault of American politicians this film must seem like a welcome relief. Our veterans do deserve to be acknowledged, and its high time the nation apologized to them for the blame it heaped upon them for doing their duty. But distorting America's role in Vietnam by focusing exclusively on the heroics does not do them a favor. It does the entire country a great disservice.",3,"Great in some ways, troubling in others",1024012800,"06 14, 2002",2002,3885,"['Based', 'true', 'story', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'first', 'significant', 'engagement', 'American', 'Vietnamese', 'soldiers', '1965', 'terms', 'realism', 'intensity', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'truly', 'state-of-the', 'are', 'easily', 'merit', 'same', 'encomia', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'human', 'interest', 'perspective', 'film', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'anguish', 'military', 'families', 'who', 'must', 'face', 'fear', 'reality', 'loved', 'ones', 'dying', 'battle', 'film', 'maker', 'credit', 'make', 'significant', 'effort', 'portray', 'Vietnamese', 'enemy', 'good', 'guys', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'doing', 'thing.Oddly', 'enough', 'part', 'movie', 'object', 'most', 'one', 'frequently', 'showcased', 'trailers', 'talk', 'shows', 'scene', 'protagonist', 'played', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'asked', 'daughter', 'why', 'people', 'fight', 'wars', 'war', 'what', 'when', 'bad', 'men', 'try', 'hurt', 'other', 'men', 'men', 'daddy', 'try', 'stop', 'words', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'not', 'only', 'young', 'daughter', 'understandably', 'innocent', 'description', 'warfare', 'general', 'also', 'entire', 'theme', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'single', 'sound', 'byte', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'telling', 'Vietnamese', 'were', 'bad', 'guys', 'Americans', 'were', 'good', 'guys', 'who', 'were', 'trying', 'stop', 'them.These', 'lines', 'when', 'consider', 'context', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'following', 'newly', 'blazed', 'trail', 'neo-war', 'movies', 'began', 'films', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'film', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'films', 'followed', 'reversed', 'three', 'decades', 'objective', 'analytical', 'war', 'films', 'such', 'Tora', 'Tora', 'Tora', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Platoon', 'Casualties', 'War', 'instead', 'replaced', 'sentimental', 'jingoistic', 'view', 'American', 'military', 'action', 'was', 'acceptable', 'enough', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'really', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'trouble', 'distinguishing', 'right', 'wrong', 'event', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'however', 'Hollywood', 'now', 'attempted', 'reshape', 'public', 'understanding', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'similarly', 'benign', 'simplistic', 'guidelines.At', 'point', 'many', 'readers', 'are', 'probably', 'thinking', 'true', 'story', 'How', 'can', 'possibly', 'state', 'misleading', 'perfectly', 'valid', 'question', 'would', 'respond', 'first', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'misleading', 'many', 'ways', 'second', 'EXCLUSION', 'facts', 'film', 'misleading', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'presents', 'American', 'troops', 'benign', 'interventionists', 'conflict', 'new', 'little', 'doing', 'ugly', 'realities', 'what', 'American', 'presence', 'Vietnam', 'meant', 'millions', 'Vietnamese', 'begin', 'U.S.', 'Congress', 'course', 'war', 'United', 'States', 'killed', 'approximately', '1,350,000', 'civilians', 'accounts', 'highly', 'conservative', 'estimate', 'addition', 'are', 'numerous', 'well', 'documented', 'instances', 'crimes', 'perpetrated', 'American', 'military', 'Vietnamese', 'civilians', 'including', 'rape', 'murder', 'theft', 'unlawful', 'imprisonment', 'destruction', 'farmland', 'torture', 'contamination', 'forced', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'wonderful', 'reasons', 'action', 'packed', 'loosely', 'historical', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'also', 'problematic', 'seeing', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'do', 'research', 'library', 'online', 'least', 'see', 'films', 'offer', 'different', 'perspectives', 'war', 'know', 'many', 'veterans', 'unjustly', 'blamed', 'something', 'was', 'largely', 'fault', 'American', 'politicians', 'film', 'must', 'seem', 'welcome', 'relief', 'veterans', 'do', 'deserve', 'be', 'acknowledged', 'high', 'time', 'nation', 'apologized', 'blame', 'heaped', 'doing', 'duty', 'distorting', 'America', 'role', 'Vietnam', 'focusing', 'exclusively', 'heroics', 'not', 'do', 'favor', 'entire', 'country', 'great', 'disservice']",N/A

I know comparisons are made to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan, however this movie portrays the realism of Vietnam, where the others show the horrors of Somalia and World War 2. The comparison should stop there. Having served in Vietnam some 5 years after the conclusion of this battle...I have some recollections as to how these things came down. It was very hard for me to sit through this movie...the realism is very good and the acting fine. I had a small problem with Mel Gibson as Colonel Moore, sounding a bit ""John Wayneish"", almost like he patterned himself after Mr. Wayne, but aside from that he still gave a good performance.  Sam Elliot's performance as the unit's Sergeant Major is the highlight of the movie and although some of it is lighthearted in the early part of the movie, his character is totally believable.

I didn't understand the full mind-set of the era, even though I've read several books on the events that took place during the war. This movie, and this movie alone explained it to me. And in truth it's one of those movies that I wish I hadn't seen.For an epic war story this movie had all of the aspects that make a movie great. It had outstanding cinematography that parallels both ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down."" The choices made for the music to this movie only add to the atmosphere of the battlegrounds. And the opening sequence that ends with the audience staring down the barrel of a gun, creates an absolutely disturbing feeling. But this movie also includes a wonderful story behind the soldiers, that a lot of movies tend to forget about. The wives that had to survive the war finally got their just amount of screen time.(and not the terribly stupid love story time that ""Pearl Harbor"" spawned) The novel ""Black Hawk Down"" did an excellent job of showing both sides of the conflict, that Ridley Scott seemed to lose in the making of the movie. This time, director Randall Wallace didn't make the same mistake and that made for a much better movie.The acting in this movie was superb. Mel Gibson did a great job as usual, continuing his quest to fight in every war that ever took place. Barry Pepper filled his role as reporter Joe Calloway nicely. Sam Elliot had by far the strongest characters in the movie, Sergeant Major Plumley, and I can't see anyone else in his role. Even Chris Klein, of ""American Pie"" fame, could pass for an actor in this movie.What seals this movie as a great in my mind, was the closing minutes of the film. Some movies sadden me, but I can handle soldiers being killed and widows crying, without really blinking an eye. But this movie really got to me. The North Vietnamese general's lines at the close of the movie, sum up the despair that was to come. And I finally understood what the war did to this country. And for the first time in a long time, I left the theatre with tears in my eyes.The Breakdown:1.  Plot- 9 (Great choice for a true life war topic)2.  Characters- 10 (Nicely chosen characters to focus on out of the hundreds who fought the battle)3.  Flow- 9 (Spent an adequate time on the background story and the action scenes went by quickly)4.  Atmosphere- 10 (Battle grounds were realistic and excellent choices for music)5.  Cinematography- 10 (Beautifully shot and realistic special effects)6.  Entertainment factor- 10 (the time flew by)7.  Replay factor- 8 (solid movie, but some will be bothered to much to watch a second time)8.  Casting/character depth- 9 (everyone deserved to be in this movie and Sam Elliot was awesome)9.  Relevance to genre- 9 (Great war movie that had very emotional aspects)10.

Hutton ""book maven""","[7, 8]","From the duo that gave us ""Braveheart"", director Randall Wallace and actor Mel Gibson create a realistic and utterly graphic portrayal of the first firefight between American and Vietnames forces in 1965. This is NOT a movie for children or young teens due to its many scenes of the carnage of war.Based upon the book by two participants of the battle, the movie opens in 1964 with Lt. Col. Harold Moore picking, training and molding his men who were to form the 7th Air Cavalry. It shares with ""Blackhawk Down"" the credo that no man is left behind and the concept that your unit is your family from ""Band of Brothers"".This is one of the few war films that focuses upon the cost to the wives and families left behind. A nice touch is the parallel bonding done by the wives at home while the men are bonding during their training. Later the movie moves back and forth between the three day battle fought by the husbands and the insensitive telegram notification of their deaths (by Yellow Cab no less) to the wives.As the emotional heart of the film, Barry Pepper is a standout as the UPI journalist who covers the battle and must bear witness to its cost in American lives (he later co-wrote the book with Lt. Gen. Moore). Mel Gibson (with a Southern accent) gives a fine performance as family man and commanding officer Moore. The supporting cast is excellent (esp. Greg Kinnear as the hotshot helicopter pilot, Sam Elliott as the Sgt. Major and Madelene Stowe as Mrs. Moore among others).The battle scences are true to their time period (with Moore serving as the technical advisor to the film), the effective soundtrack altenates between Irish melodies & war drumming while the cinematography is rich.

I can say that it probably depicts the battle very truthfully. I have the book too, and this movie differs very little from the book. There are a few things that are put in that actually happened later. For example, this movie has the North Vietnamese realising that to overrun the Americans, they have to get in close enough to avoid artilery. It did not happen until a battle shortly after Ia Drang. Also, the North Vietnamese never broke through the American lines in Ia Drang. That was later also. Other than that, nearly all of the details of the battle are correct, except that they did not lose a helicopter while bringing men into the landing zone.This movie is very bloody, but it almost has to be to accurately depict the action. The movie would not have seemed quite as real without it.Overall, it is a very good movie. I would highly recommend that you see this movie. Even more, I would recommend that you read the book ""We Were Soldiers Once... and Young"", which is the book from which this movie was made.

We Were Soldiers not only shows you the teamwork and epic struggle but the terrifying images of what the soldiers faced to get to that strong bond with oneanother.The movie flickers from one soldiers point of view to another soldiers and then you wonder whats with the random chaos?Squad to squad dead soldier to dead soldier eventually you see all these loosends tie in.When a main character or a well known character dies for his country you always feel that pain and shallowness.One thing i was truly amazed by was the fact that they show you that our (U.S. troops)isn't always ruthless.They show you what some of Vietnamiese had to part with to fight for honor.The soldiers going into battle are young and inexperienced and don't know what to expect,you can see their mistakes and what they learned from them.Movies like this really help those who are greedy or inconsiderate to others,as it teaches you what these soldiers went through and what you take for granted.They are no stronger or smarter then any of us they were working as a family to progress(Wich all of should and can).A really heartwarming and terrifying film all in one creepy way.A must see drama/action film.",5,A Mature War Film,1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,2356,"['Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'spawned', 'whole', 'bring', 'back', 'war', 'movies', 'general.Though', 'many', 'never', 'lived', 'up', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'exception.This', 'never', 'was', 'category', 'much', 'grittier', 'war', 'film.Depicted', 'much', 'more', 'realism', 'many', 'have', 'guts', 'do', 'so.During', 'Vietnam', 'conflict', 'lost', 'many', 'soldiers', 'gained', 'many', 'hero', 'shouyld', 'know', 'uncle', 'got', 'grenade', 'fragment', 'lodged', 'eye', 'many', 'said', 'dead', 'harsh', 'cruel', 'reality', 'society', 'war', 'whole.Raising', 'head', 'adjusting', 'uncomfortable', 'strap', 'could', 'be', 'difference', 'life', 'death.The', 'movie', 'off', 'alittle', 'slow', 'short', 'intense', 'intro.Once', 'kicked', 'war', 'full', 'throttle', 'way', 'whole', 'film.With', 'miner', 'cut', 'ins', 'soldiers', 'wives', 'Little', 'realsitic', 'side', 'plot', 'Many', 'who', 'fought', 'wars', 'look', 'war', 'films', 'critique', 'actions', 'given', 'off', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'like', 'true', 'horror', 'wondering', 'survival', 'questionable', 'false', 'hope', 'anyone', 'modern', 'day', 'can', 'actually', 'understand', 'true', 'concept', 'what', 'brave', 'men', 'went', 'through.Movies', 'most', 'oftenly', 'never', 'catch', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'not', 'only', 'teamwork', 'epic', 'struggle', 'terrifying', 'images', 'what', 'soldiers', 'faced', 'get', 'strong', 'bond', 'oneanother.The', 'movie', 'flickers', 'one', 'soldiers', 'point', 'view', 'soldiers', 'then', 'wonder', 'whats', 'random', 'chaos', 'Squad', 'squad', 'dead', 'soldier', 'dead', 'soldier', 'eventually', 'see', 'loosends', 'tie', 'in.When', 'main', 'character', 'well', 'known', 'character', 'dies', 'country', 'always', 'feel', 'pain', 'shallowness.One', 'thing', 'i', 'was', 'truly', 'amazed', 'was', 'fact', 'show', 'U.S.', 'troops', ""n't"", 'always', 'ruthless.They', 'show', 'what', 'Vietnamiese', 'had', 'part', 'fight', 'honor.The', 'soldiers', 'going', 'battle', 'are', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'can', 'see', 'mistakes', 'what', 'learned', 'them.Movies', 'really', 'help', 'who', 'are', 'greedy', 'inconsiderate', 'others', 'what', 'soldiers', 'went', 'what', 'take', 'granted.They', 'are', 'stronger', 'smarter', 'then', 'were', 'working', 'family', 'progress', 'Wich', 'should', 'can', '.A', 'really', 'heartwarming', 'terrifying', 'film', 'one', 'creepy', 'way.A', 'must', 'see', 'drama/action', 'film']",N/A

Starring Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Hal Moore, the film tells the true story of the first major encounter between American troops and North Vietnam. There, in the la Drang Valley (""the Valley of Death""), 450 Americans were dropped by helicopters into a clearing and subsequently ambushed and surrounded by 2,000 Viet Cong from October 23 to November 6, 1965. In addition to capturing the bravery, patriotism, heroism, horror, and idiocy of war, this film is special for at least two reasons. First, it portrays the battles that the families who were left at home also had to fight while their loved ones were 12,000 miles away. The entire first third of the film focuses on the families at home, and the rest of the film repeatedly cuts back to them. Second, the film humanizes the enemy. The enemy must be fought, but they are not ""evil."" In fact, we learn that they are just like us. There are five prayers in this film, one of which is by a Viet Cong and which, verbatim, could have been uttered by any human being. Similarly, right after watching a young American widow grieve, the film cuts to a young Vietnamese widow crying as she clutches a diary returned from her dead husband (the diary contains her own picture that her husband had carried). The end of this film names the Americans who died at la Drang; it also pays tribute to ""the members of the People's Army of North Vietnam who died in that place.""

A commander that had to be strong and brave and knowingly order thousands to their death.After this movie you see the other side of war you see what it is like to be the last and only one to see the whole thing alive and in one piece.  You see the courage that all the american men had to be in the war that they were in.  All the men were in one way or another married to eachother in combat.  Each of them had a common respect and courtesy towards one another and each wanted to see the next make it to the next day.""Till death do us part"" is the message that you hear through out this film and even after death parting is no easier.

Though I currently have a brother serving proudly in the U.S. Army, my own experiences are strictly cinematic.  I wholeheartedly embrace the message this film espouses and any criticisms of it are strictly artistic.  I completely embrace the accounts of Hal Moore and his experiences in Vietnam it's just unfortunate that he did not have a more skilled director like Coppola, Kubrick, or Stone instead of a relative novice film-maker like Randall Wallace.  Better yet, star Mel Gibson should have taken the directorial reigns of this film.  The movie's strength is in it's acting and story.  Mel Gibson gives a solid performance as Moore.  The underrated Sam Elliott gave an awardworthy turn as Moore's gruff aide, Plumley.  Madeleine Stowe and Keri Russell are equally good as the women that are left at home.  Greg Kinnear as the cocky chopper pilot is a change of pace for him.  I like the way the film juxtaposes events, going from the battlefield, to the homefront where the wives await the news from the frontlines, to the Americans' Vietcong counterparts who are not faceless entities who have loved ones as well and are just as resolute in the cause that they are fighting for.

I doubt serious if I will be able to add and significant information to what has already been said.  I can and will only voice my opinion; my personal ""take,"" as to the merits of this film.First though I must state that I completely ignore the fact that some folks are Mel Gibson fans and think his is a great guy, while other despise him due to his off screen behavior and some of the remarks he has made over the past few years.  I also hate to see this film and these reviews, along with remarks on many of the reviews, being used as a platform to voice opinions over the merits of the Viet Nam war and those who fought in it.Anyway...I like this film.  I thought it was quite well done.  There have been literally hundreds upon hundreds of war films made throughout the years and only a very few of them actually ""got it.""  Of those few that did get it, even they cannot possibly offer people who have never experienced the actual horror of war even a close or vague feeling of what it is really like.  I will say though that this film is pretty close...as far as it goes.One of the first things that impressed me was the extremely narrow ""field of vision,"" during the battle scenes.  In battle soldiers are, for the most part, only aware of a very, very small area (their little world) of the actually overall conflict.  This many times consists of only a few yards.  I thought this film depicted that very well...mass confusion, extreme fear...totally alone.I was also grateful for the makers of the film in that the depicted absolutely perfectly the way the wives and children of the deployed solders were treated upon notification of their husband's deaths as the battle raged.  The Army and our government were completely unprepared for what happened and this aspect of this battle, and indeed, this war was not one of our more shinning moments.  All in all it was disgraceful. I hope and pray that lessons were learned here...although I have my doubts as to this.There was a bang up job done with the camera work in this film and the script was excellent.  I found nothing to complain about in either of these two areas.The debate as to the rightness or wrongness of this was has been argued since the first shot was fired and I suspect will still be argued far, far into the future.  Right or wrong has absolutely nothing to do with these brave young men who fought in this particular cornerstone battle.

It was refreshing to see the Viet Cong depicted as soldiers no less human than their US counterparts, and not vilified for being the enemy. The story of the wives back home running parallel to the main battle was a nice touch which provided welcome relief from the horror of the battlefield, but in it's own way was a stressful part of the movie.  Overall I give the movie the thumbs up.  I don't see myself watching it again in the near future, but 6 months down the track I think `We Were Soldiers' will deserve another viewing.

705708,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B000068TPN,D. Litton,"[29, 34]","&quot;Those of us who have seen war keep seeing it. In the silence of the night, we still hear the screams.&quot;War is hell, and &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; spends its entire relaying this brutal truth in a story that overflows with patriotic zeal, a convincing sense of chaos, and a harsh depiction of the physical reality of combat conditions. Like Ridley's Scott's &quot;Black Hawk Down,&quot; released in the holiday stretch of 2001, writer/director Randall Wallace, in his directorial debut, is careful to remind us of the emotional impact of war rather than sacrificing it for effects and thrills.It seems that Wallace has learned from previous misfires: the story, adapted from the novel by Lt. Col. Harold Moore and reporter Joseph Galloway, is everything that Wallace's previous script, &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; was not. Beginning with the introductions to military life as seen through the eyes of various soldiers and officers, we are given a unique opportunity to become involved in their family lives, bearing witness to happier times before President Johnson orders reinforcements into Vietnam.Mel Gibson is cast as Harold Moore, the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, arriving on base with his wife, Julie (Madeleine Stowe), and five young children. Among those singled out by the story to provide emotional connections are young Lt. Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein) and his expecting wife, Barbara (Keri Russell), Maj. Bruce 'Snakeshit' Crandall (Greg Kinnear), who shows a great deal of devotion to duty, and Sgt-Maj. Basil Plumley (Sam Elliott), who exacts a brutish demeanor as a result of decades of wartime experience.After a montage of tearful goodbyes that pull at the heartstrings with all their might, Wallace's film nosedives into the hellish combat of the Battle of Ia Drang, as Moore's soldiers are choppered in under heavy fire from the soldiers of the Viet Cong. After splitting into divisions, several men are surrounded, many of whom are seriously wounded, leading Moore to regroup and make attempts to rescue his entrapped soldiers, all the while battling forces surrounding his own.These brilliantly photographed and acted scenes of battle are some of cinema's most memorable, charged with physical intensity that practically jolts the audience with each explosion and gunshot. Wallace brings the viewer into the experience rather than making him a sideline witness to it, wrapping us in a continuous onslaught of sensory perception, from startling images of bloodshed and mangled bodies, to the non-stop firing of machine guns and heavy artillery.Accompanying such moments are a constant reminder of the emotional loss and grievances one goes through in times of war. We see young reporter Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper) befriending a Japanese-American soldier in the middle of combat; ten minutes later, he's rushing towards a rescue chopper, his bloodied friend hanging loose in his arms. We see the tear-strained faces of wives informed of their lost husbands. We see these soldiers, once young, their innocence stripped from them as they stare into the eyes of the enemy, and instantly, the emotional magnitude of such an event becomes a stark reality.But through it all, we see something richer, something well-defined, something forgotten in much of the modern war drivel that has graced the silver screen in years past. &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; not only packs a physical and emotional punch, but brings to light an overwhelming aura of patriotism that is evident in the heroic acts of its characters, a sense of duty and devotion that makes the movie's dialogue ring true in every way, shape and form.In playing Harold Moore, Mel Gibson recalls the glory and presence of his performance in &quot;Braveheart;&quot; his ability to juxtapose a stern demeanor with true, heartfelt displays of emotion hasn't lost its luster. The under-used Madeleine Stowe portrays Julie as a strong-willed military wife, while Keri Russell makes good use of her onscreen time. Each of the cast members who make up Moore's cavalry give heartfelt performances, most notably Barry Pepper as Galloway, whose narration bookends the film.Movies like &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; benefit from a connection to reality. The inclusion of characters Moore and Galloway serve to remind us of the factual basis for the stunning visual and emotional assault that conveys war and those affected by it. Wallace's film, while being a great tribute to those who fought for a war still misunderstood by many, is a patriotic display of courage, heroism, honor, and the knowledge that for those who have seen war, victory is bittersweet.",5,An assault on the senses that pulls at the heartstrings.,1015027200,"03 2, 2002",2002,4657,"['quot', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'war', 'keep', 'seeing', 'silence', 'night',

I certainly don't feel that my time was wasted by any means.  It was very well done, and I thought some of the acting was just brilliant. Sam Elliot deserves the Oscar for his role!  He is great in this movie, and his character gets some of the best lines of the script.Madeline Stowe, who I have never liked as an actress, plays Moore's wife.  Her and t.v.'s Felicity, Keri Russell, become fast friends being wives on base while the men are away at war.It was just heart wrenching to watch them go to the homes of the women who had lost their Hero husbands to the elements of War.It is so hard for me to review this movie, let alone recommend it. I think of going to the movies as an escape from real life. This is no escape. It is a slap in the face of the realities of the Vietnam War.  Although, this is a slap that leave a lifetime mark.

Unlike 'Black Hawk Down', 'We Were Soldiers' brings you inside the war to the people.  You really get to know the soldiers, you really feel for them.  Randall Wallace brilliantly combines the two most important aspects of the Vietnam; the battlefield and the families at home.  Many films try to do this, not many succeed.  Wallace does this by dedicating the first 40+ minutes to the familiarization of the characters and families.  While the battle is raging, Wallace frequently flashes back to the army base where the wives are faced with the difficult task of distributing death notices.Mel Gibson puts forth a brilliant and moving performance as Lt. Colonel Hal Moore.  Gibson masters this role.  We can be sure that his portrayal of Moore is accurate because he worked with the real Hal Moore while filming.  He became Moore, right down to the way he walked!  Madeleine Stowe also puts forth an impressive and emotionally driven performance as Gibson's/Moore's wife, Julie Moore.  I heard that she too worked with the real Julie Moore to help herself master the role.The battle scenes are terrifyingly realistic and haunting.  I've never seen anything like it.  I must mention one particularly haunting scene;The boys are lying in the bush at night with their guns aimed into the darkness before them.  Two terrified soldiers begin to whisper to each other; where's the enemy?  ""I can smell them, they're here"" proclaims one.  They can't see anything.  It's pitch black.  The soldiers can barely breath.  One whispers into his radio for a flare to be thrown into the woods in front of them so that they might see where their enemy is at.  The flare come, the woods light up.  The silhouettes of the Vietnamese appear.  They are only inches from where they lay.This is only one of the many haunting and unforgettable moments in 'We Were Soldiers'.  It took my breath away.'We Were Soldiers' is such an emotional film!  I found myself sobbing by the time the credits were rolling.  I wasn't the only one, either.  Grown men were crying as well.  We cried for the lost lives and the pain.  We cried for the families and the sacrifices our boys made.  This film really helped me to understand what happened in Vietnam and how it affected the families and those who lived through it.

705722,A228NBNLYJ8V3J,B000068TPN,Eran Cohen,"[23, 27]","Due to the length of my review I've divided it to two : one discusses primarily the significance of this motion picture , the other one summarizes the plot extensively .*At first , a warning - this movie is , in part , a terrible visual experience and one of the hardest I have ever seen . Prepare yourself .Part one : Reasons to see/ significance .-------------------------------------------A question you might ask could be : ""why should I take my time to see another Vietnam War movie ?""My answer would be : "" because I don't recall they have ever done such a movie about that war "" .""We were Soldiers"" deals with the Vietnam War like no other movie I have seen . I suppose the distance of time and the proclivities of today's producers allow perspectives and purposes that were unpopular in the following decades after the war .First and foremost , I agree with the director that the main purpose of the film is to heal the veterans . There were so many wounded casualties of the public's opinion that suffered just as much - and  more - after they returned home , than they had suffered throughout the Vietnam ordeal itself . We have read about it and seen it in numerous films . We have also seen many critic views about the war from Hollywood that apparently hurt the veterans as well .It's time it's stopped .The filmmakers say : ""Let others ask the questions about why they were where they were and why they did that they did , it does no good anymore , anyway"" .The realization of the main goal is given form with a firm and harsh view at how one of the first real engagements of warfare looked like from the infantryman's eyes (see veterans reviews for confirmation). That done , without intending to judge the men who were sent by their country to serve . In other words , the film recognizes the tribulations the soldiers went through and the immense sacrifices they had to make . By doing so , it helps those men if just to feel a little better regarding their personal history and actions . In that it assists the healing process of the old wounds they carry deep inside .In a way , I think it does well with the Vietcong's vets too . In here the enemy is given one of the fairest and balanced trials I've seen . More than ever we acknowledge and identify with his aims , missions , struggles and pain . Perhaps when coming from the American point of view it means something to them and makes them feel better too .The movie also shows the angle of the wives back home , scenes that are familiar here in Israel , but are always important at showing how the lives of the close ones that are left behind continue , or more accurately stand still in the face of a war .Part two : The plot and the cast .--------------------------------""We Were Soldiers"" is divided into two parts - the preface to the fight that is to come , and the battle itself .The exposition presents most of the heroes of our story : Colonel Hal Moore (Gibson) , his wife Julie (Madeline Stowe ) , the sergeant major (Sam Elliot) and Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein) to name a few . Here the movie concentrates mainly on Gibson and his family plus the forming and training of his battalion . The focal point is the fear of Gibson from the hell he knows he is going to face in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam . This part is rather bearable (tension wise) owning to number of scenes about the ideal family (Moore's) and the forming of campaign leaders , but at the same time uneasy knowing what is to come .The body of the film is the incarnation of hell when Moore and his men set their feet on the Vietcong's turf . The shootings , bombing and body count begin immediately and are almost unbearable . I've never seen such concentrated sights of death , slaughter and destruction . In this region ""We were Soldiers"" sets a new record ; it's a long step forward in the presentation of war realism that easily surpasses the bloodiest sights of Gibson's ""BraveHeart"" and ""the Patriot"" together .The stardom of Gibson is set-aside a bit in the wake of the ongoing battle , as different men and their actions for good or ill are highlighted . Gibson shines again in portraying the agony and pain his character suffers from ; this happens on account of the speeding number of the dead bodies of his men , while holding the leader-commander position and being in charge of everything . Throughout the movie this sense of personal lose and great responsibility is evident in Gibson's performance and in many ways it's a continuance of his stature appearances in previous films .In the heat of the battle a young reporter (Barry Pepper) joins the film's staff and fighting men to cover the combat . For a while , he takes on a leading roll as the story concentrates in his experiences and reactions to the horrible trials surrounding him . To me , he represents the common viewer's reactions if dropped , at this point , into the fire : shocked , terrified and disbelieving he is witnessing such reality . In fulfilling that goal he is successful and does a great job .Madeline Stowe is the leading actress at the U.S. , where the women are waiting in awe for news from the front . She delivers a commendable appearance portraying the wife of Hal Moore , who takes hold of the difficult duty of telling the bad news about the husbands to the family at the home base .==============================================================I've waited for a long time to see this movie , was shocked by the sights , and after I've digested its important aspects , I think I can see the importance and significance of this movie .In the end , I hope I have helped you to see them too .",4,The Healing .,1026086400,"07 8, 2002",2002,5642,"['Due', 'length', 'review', ""'ve"",

705724,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B000068TPN,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 1]","The Viet Nam War was ripe pickings for film makers. It was unlike the previous wars with its fuzzier outline and non-existent end game. This is a near unique entry into the genre.Here's the scoop. Lt. Col. Hal Moore is about to engage in the first open battle between the American troops and the NVA during the Viet Nam conflict. He has studied the strategy (or non-strategy) of the previous French troops and outlines his own strategy for success in the battle. It turns out to be a tougher fight than he had figured on.This is a very straight forward movie. I don't know how closely it sticks to what actually happened but it sure feels right. And Randall Wallace's efficient and adroit direction, manages to pull that off. It's not as flashy in its visual style as, say, &#34;Platoon&#34; but the shots are set up well and the editing is near seamless. It has a more immediate quality to it. Very intense things happen but the intensity id felt by its nature and not by overpowering direction. The acting is generally very good. Gibson does a fine job as does Sam Elliot as the commanding Sergeant. Greg Kinnear is a chopper pilot and I could have used more of him. There are other faces that have gained more credits since this was made. They also take time to visit what happens at home with the wives as they begin receiving death notices of their husbands.Some complain about the film's political correctness. Nowhere are pejorative terms used in regard to the enemy. I guess that's a valid complaint but it didn't bother me. Also, I took exception to Gibson's remorse at the end that many of his men died and he did not. That didn't ring true to me. It's my opinion that the commander is needed to use his witts so that as few of his men die as possible. Then there are the curious final words of the NVA commander. Being as he was just beaten horribly and lost some 1,800 men, his optimism is curious at best.This si absolutely one of the better war films ever made.

They seem contrived, not natural. However,the film flows more nicely once the guys get to Nam. Another problem with the film is that Wallace decides to portray the side of the enemy. This worked fairly well in Pearl Harbor, cause it led to the suspense of the coming attack. But here it seems as if Wallace is haphazardly trying to cause sympathy for the enemy. We know when the enemy will attack, so we are prepared when it comes. Wallace should've left the part concerning the enemy out all together, except for a touching scene at the end. Lastly, although I admire Mel Gibson as an actor he seems out of his element here. It is mostly because of dialogue, his one-liners make him seem more like a politician than a military man. Those circumstances aside, this is an enjoyable movie. There are some heartbreaking scenes (I give the film credit for addressing the ""war at home"" front.) And I must say it's refreshing to see a Vietnam film that doesn't portay the solidiers as either brutal mercenaries or strung out dope addicts.

705728,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B000068TPN,"""flickjunkie""","[8, 10]","""Saving Private Ryan"" redefined the war genre and opened the floodgates to a new generation of war movies.  It pushed the boundaries of acceptability by frankly showing war in all its grisly glory.  As such it gave us a better understanding of how terrible and frightening war is.  ""Black Hawk Down"" took the graphic violence to a new level, with an intensity that matched the beach landing of SPR, but of a duration that was almost unbearable.""We Were Soldiers"" is the latest big budget war offering from Hollywood.  In many ways, I consider this to be the most complete of the three.  Writer/Director Randall Wallace (who wrote &quot;Braveheart&quot;, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; and the screenplay for this film), takes the understanding of war to the next level, by offering more than one perspective to the events.  Of the three films, this film has the best workup, the best character development, and the most nuanced look at the battle.  He brings all the sustained intensity of BHD in the action sequences, but introduces the NVA perspective, the wives' perspective and a far more charismatic and heroic central figure in Lt. Col. Hal Moore.Based on real events, this film shows war as being horrendous and heartless to both sides.  It expands outside the combat zone to visit the ramifications on the families as well.  The scenes with the wives getting the telegrams are poignant reminders of how war reaches beyond the battlefield.  Wallace's treatment grabs us on an emotional level and shocks the senses.  Unlike BHD, which presented the characters in a very anonymous way, we come to know these characters and their families and identify with them.Of course, the film lacks the hard edge that would make it starkly believable.  It is after all a Hollywood production and not a documentary.  However, Wallace pours enough realism into the depictions to assure that this doesn't turn into another sappy melodrama like ""Pearl Harbor"", which was really nothing more than a romance with a long battle scene in the middle.  Wallace finds the optimal balance between engaging storytelling and the brutality of combat.The acting is excellent.  Mel Gibson offers the right combination of hard nosed officer and father figure (both to his children and his men).  Gibson is steadfast and courageous without being harsh.  His portrayal of Moore is so well played, so charismatic and heroic, that it is impossible to believe that such a person could actually exist.Sam Elliot follows an outstanding performance in ""The Contender"" with this gem as Sergeant Major Plumley, the tough as nails warhorse who serves as Moore's non commissioned adjutant.  Elliot plays the intransigent career soldier to the hilt, where nothing including life itself is more important than honor and discipline.  Barry Pepper also turns in a fine performance as Joe Galloway, the photo journalist who hops on a helicopter to take pictures in the center of the battle and finds himself with a rifle in his hands fighting for his life.This is among the best war films in recent memory and probably the best film on the Vietnam War film since ""Full Metal Jacket"".  I rated it a 10/10.  This film is not for everyone.  It contains graphic violence and disturbingly realistic battle scenes.  It is a gripping and distressing film that should be required viewing for statesmen and generals alike.",5,Among the best war films in recent memory,1032739200,"09 23, 2002",2002,3365,"['Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'redefined', 'war', 'genre', 'opened', 'floodgates', 'new', 'generation', 'war', 'movies', 'pushed', 'boundaries', 'acceptability', 'frankly', 'showing', 'war', 'grisly', 'glory', 'such', 'gave', 'better', 'understanding', 'how', 'terrible', 'frightening', 'war', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'took', 'graphic', 'violence', 'new', 'level', 'intensity', 'matched', 'beach', 'landing', 'SPR', 'duration', 'was', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'latest', 'big', 'budget', 'war', 'offering', 'Hollywood', 'many', 'ways', 'consider', 'be', 'most', 'complete', 'three', 'Writer/Director', 'Randall', 'Wallace', 'who', 'wrote', 'quot', 'Braveheart', 'quot', 'quot', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'quot', 'screenplay', 'film', 'understanding', 'war', 'next', 'level', 'offering', 'more', 'one', 'perspective', 'events', 'three', 'films', 'film', 'best', 'workup', 'best', 'character', 'development', 'most', 'nuanced', 'look', 'battle', 'sustained', 'intensity', 'BHD', 'action', 'sequences', 'NVA', 'perspective', 'wives', 'perspective', 'far', 'more', 'charismatic', 'heroic', 'central', 'figure', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Hal', 'Moore.Based', 'real', 'events', 'film', 'war', 'being', 'horrendous', 'heartless', 'sides', 'combat', 'zone', 'visit', 'ramifications', 'families', 'well', 'scenes', 'wives', 'getting', 'telegrams', 'are', 'poignant', 'reminders', 'how', 'war', 'battlefield', 'Wallace', 'treatment', 'emotional', 'level', 'senses', 'BHD', 'presented', 'characters', 'very', 'anonymous', 'way', 'come', 'know', 'characters', 'families', 'identify', 'them.Of', 'course', 'film', 'hard', 'edge', 'would', 'make', 'starkly', 'believable', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'not', 'documentary', 'However', 'Wallace', 'enough', 'realism', 'depictions', 'assure', ""n't"", 'turn', 'sappy', 'melodrama', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'was', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'romance', 'long', 'battle', 'scene', 'middle', 'Wallace', 'optimal', 'balance', 'engaging', 'storytelling', 'brutality', 'combat.The', 'acting', 'excellent', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'right', 'combination', 'hard', 'nosed', 'officer', 'father', 'figure', 'children', 'men', 'Gibson', 'steadfast', 'courageous', 'being', 'harsh', 'portrayal', 'Moore', 'so', 'well', 'played', 'charismatic', 'heroic', 'impossible', 'believe', 'person', 'could', 'actually', 'exist.Sam', 'Elliot', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Contender', 'gem', 'Sergeant', 'Major', 'Plumley', 'tough', 'nails', 'warhorse', 'who', 'Moore', 'non', 'commissioned', 'adjutant', 'Elliot', 'intransigent', 'career', 'soldier', 'hilt', 'where', 'nothing', 'including', 'life', 'more', 'important', 'honor', 'discipline', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'also', 'fine', 'performance', 'Joe', 'Galloway', 'photo', 'journalist', 'who', 'helicopter', 'take', 'pictures', 'center', 'battle', 'rifle', 'hands', 'fighting', 'life.This', 'best', 'war', 'films', 'recent', 'memory', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'film', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'rated', '10/10', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'graphic', 'violence', 'disturbingly', 'realistic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'gripping', 'distressing', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'statesmen', 'generals', 'alike']",N/A

705730,A1XK32B1GRLEO6,B000068TPN,"Fun Blue Eyes ""There's no cryin!""","[6, 8]","Every now and again, movies depicting factual events (Saving Private Ryan, JFK, We Were Soldiers, Windtalkers, et al) are either vilified or praised.  Depending on how well you value historical accuracy VS creative liberties, the movie you are watching could be the best or the worst.Pvt Ryan didn't exist; according to some of the Navajo Windtalkers-the movie of the same name had a few ""Hollywood Moments"".  Point is, there's probably no movie out there without a few liberties taken here and there in the script.  Email me one or two (with verifiable examples) and then you will have a definite discussion on your hands.Either way, WWS made my then-fiance cry after the final battle scene, once Moore (Gibson) placed his foot on the copter and gave the field a final once over.  This is a fantastic movie that shows (finally), how the North Vietnamese tactics were utilized to try to cut off supply lines, and so on.  From what I read from the book; which I read before even production wrapped up on the movie (I finished the book about two weeks before the first trailers were released in the theatres), Moore and Plumbley were accurately protrayed as gritty career soldiers that wanted to win.  The ""stand up while everyone else is down"" is the way one is supposed to be when directing troops on the field.  This way, the Colonel (or Sgt Major) can get an overview of the situation.Moore is a booksmarts Colonel.  You can gather that from the constant studying of Custer's Last Stand, the Battle of French Indochina massacre, and the capabilites of the Huey.  He also brings up a story about a Native American brought up by the whole village.  The meaning behind it is clear.From an interview from Randall Wallace roughly two months after the movie was released: ""....Harold Moore is portrayed in the script as a larger-than-life leader who seemed to always make the right move. In a newspaper interview the real Harold Moore was quoted as saying that he would have liked John Wayne to play him, indeed. But what supports this presentation in the script is the book. I know, he wrote the book, and could present himself any damn way he wanted. But when you read the book, you get the sense of a humble, honest, and heroic solider who was not going to let his men down, he would rather face death then face the widow of a solider who he did not return home from the battlefield, dead or alive. He wasn't trying to be a hero, but just doing his job....""Not only does WWS show the first major skirmish of the Vietnam Conflict, but it also shows the overall effects of the wives.  The letters, the angst over a falsified address, etc.  It tugs at the heart when you see the one black woman almost refusing to accept the telegram.  You don't get that in most other war movies; nor do you see the wives interact with each other.  A friend of mine compared the living room scene early in the movie to a meeting of wives and girlfriends at a Reserve Center Base or Training Grounds.The only ""Hollywood"" moment I really saw was the Joe Galloway montage during Day 3.Sgt Savage had the hardest job in the world.  He had no formal training, nor did he even want the job of troop leader when both his Lt's died.  But he did a remarkable job in helping his fellow soldiers through an extremely trying day and a half at the Knoll.This is a ""Flag Waver""...but in sticking to the American style of moviemaking...one must keep with a happy and warm ending.Watch Darkman or Basic Instinct for examples of endings that don't quite gel with most people.Rent it...or better yet, buy it...and crank the speakers to 11.",5,Fantastic movie....simply put.,1138924800,"02 3, 2006",2006,3601,"['now', 'again', 'movies', 'depicting', 'factual', 'events', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'JFK', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'Windtalkers', 'et', 'al', 'are', 'vilified', 'praised', 'Depending', 'how', 'well', 'value', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'VS', 'creative', 'liberties', 'movie', 'are', 'watching', 'could', 'be', 'best', 'worst.Pvt', 'Ryan', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'according', 'Navajo', 'Windtalkers-the', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'had', 'few', 'Hollywood', 'Moments', 'Point', 'probably', 'movie', 'there', 'few', 'liberties', 'taken', 'here', 'there', 'script', 'Email', 'one', 'two', 'verifiable', 'examples', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'definite', 'discussion', 'hands.Either', 'way', 'WWS', 'made', 'then-fiance', 'cry', 'final', 'battle', 'scene', 'once', 'Moore', 'Gibson', 'placed', 'foot', 'copter', 'gave', 'field', 'final', 'once', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'finally', 'how', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'tactics', 'were', 'utilized', 'try', 'cut', 'off', 'supply', 'lines', 'so', 'what', 'read', 'book', 'read', 'even', 'production', 'wrapped', 'up', 'movie', 'finished', 'book', 'two', 'weeks', 'first', 'trailers', 'were', 'released', 'theatres', 'Moore', 'Plumbley', 'were', 'accurately', 'protrayed', 'gritty', 'career', 'soldiers', 'wanted', 'win', 'stand', 'up', 'everyone', 'else', 'down', 'way', 'one', 'supposed', 'be', 'when', 'directing', 'troops', 'field', 'way', 'Colonel', 'Sgt', 'Major', 'can', 'get', 'overview', 'situation.Moore', 'booksmarts', 'Colonel', 'can', 'gather', 'constant', 'studying', 'Custer', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Battle', 'French', 'Indochina', 'massacre', 'capabilites', 'Huey', 'also', 'up', 'story', 'Native', 'American', 'brought', 'up', 'whole', 'village', 'meaning', 'clear.From', 'interview', 'Randall', 'Wallace', 'roughly', 'two', 'months', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '.Harold', 'Moore', 'portrayed', 'script', 'larger-than-life', 'leader', 'who', 'seemed', 'always', 'make', 'right', 'move', 'newspaper', 'interview', 'real', 'Harold', 'Moore', 'was', 'quoted', 'saying', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'John', 'Wayne', 'play', 'indeed', 'what', 'presentation', 'script', 'book', 'know', 'wrote', 'book', 'could', 'present', 'damn', 'way', 'wanted', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'get', 'sense', 'humble', 'honest', 'heroic', 'solider', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'let', 'men', 'down', 'would', 'rather', 'face', 'death', 'then', 'face', 'widow', 'solider', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'return', 'home', 'battlefield', 'dead', 'alive', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'be', 'hero', 'just', 'doing', 'job', 'Not', 'only', 'WWS', 'show', 'first', 'major', 'skirmish', 'Vietnam', 'Conflict', 'also', 'overall', 'effects', 'wives', 'letters', 'angst', 'falsified', 'address', 'etc', 'heart', 'when', 'see', 'one', 'black', 'woman', 'almost', 'refusing', 'accept', 'telegram', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'most', 'other', 'war', 'movies', 'do', 'see', 'wives', 'interact', 'other', 'friend', 'mine', 'compared', 'living', 'room', 'scene', 'early', 'movie', 'meeting', 'wives', 'girlfriends', 'Reserve', 'Center', 'Base', 'Training', 'Grounds.The', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'moment', 'really', 'saw', 'was', 'Joe', 'Galloway', 'montage', 'Day', '3.Sgt', 'Savage', 'had', 'hardest', 'job', 'world', 'had', 'formal', 'training', 'did', 'even', 'want', 'job', 'troop', 'leader', 'when', 'Lt', 'died', 'did', 'remarkable', 'job', 'helping', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'extremely', 'trying', 'day', 'half', 'Knoll.This', 'Flag', 'Waver', 'sticking', 'American', 'style', 'moviemaking', 'one', 'must', 'keep', 'happy', 'warm', 'ending.Watch', 'Darkman', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'examples', 'endings', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'gel', 'most', 'people.Rent', 'better', 'yet', 'buy', 'crank', 'speakers', '11']",N/A
705731,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000068TPN,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[728, 770]","I live with a Vietnam Vet who served in the late 1960s with 1st Cav. Medivac. During service he earned two Purple Hearts, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Air Medal.  Since WE WERE SOLDIERS concerns the 1st Cav., Randy wanted to see it.  I reluctantly agreed; I am not partial to war films and I dislike Mel Gibson, and Randy is very hard on Vietnam War films.  He dismisses PLATOON as a Hollywood 8x10 glossy; says APOCALYPSE NOW is an interesting movie that captures the paranoia, but all the technical details are wrong; and describes DEER HUNTER as excellent in its depiction of the strangeness of coming home but so full of plot holes that he can hardly endure it.  And about one and all he says: ""It wasn't like that.""He was silent through the film, and when we left the theatre I asked what he thought.  He said, ""They finally got it.  That's what it was like.  All the details are right.  The actors were just like the men I knew.  They looked like that and they talked like that.  And the army wives too, they really were like that, at least every one I ever knew.""  The he was silent for a long time.  At last he said, ""You remember the scene where the guy tries to pick up a burn victim by the legs and all the skin slides off?  Something like that happened to me once.  It was at a helicopter crash.  I went to pick him up and all the skin just slid right off.  It looked just like that, too.  I've never told any one about it.""In most respects WE WERE SOLDIERS is a war movie plain and simple. There are several moments when the film relates the war to the politics and social movements that swirled about it, and the near destruction of the 1st. Cav.'s 7th Battalion at Ia Drang clearly arises from the top brass' foolish decision to send the 7th into an obvious ambush--but the film is not so much interested in what was going on at home or at the army's top as it is in what was actually occurring on the ground.  And in this it is extremely meticulous, detailed, and often horrifically successful.  Neither Randy nor I--nor any one in the theatre I could see--was bored by or dismissive of the film.  It grabs you and it grabs you hard, and I can easily say that it is one of the finest war movies I have ever seen, far superior to the likes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, which seems quite tame in comparison.Perhaps the single most impressive thing about the film is that it never casts its characters in a heroic light; they are simply soldiers who have been sent to do a job, and they do it knowing the risks, and they do it well in spite of the odds.  Mel Gibson, although I generally despise him as both an actor and a human being, is very, very good as commanding officer Hal Moore, and he is equaled by Sam Elliot, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, and every other actor on the battlefield.  The supporting female cast, seen early in the film and in shorter scenes showing the home front as the battle rages, is also particularly fine, with Julie Moore able to convey in glance what most actresses could not communicate in five pages of dialogue.  The script, direction, cinematography, and special effects are sharp, fast, and possess a ""you are there"" quality that is very powerful.Randy did have a criticism.  ""I don't think there would be time for casualty telegrams to actually get home while the battle was going on,"" he said.  ""After all, it only lasted three days.""  I myself had a criticism; there were points in the film when I found the use of a very modernistic, new-agey piece of music to be intrusive and out of place.  And we both felt that a scene near the end of the movie, when a Vietnamese commander comments on the battle, to be improbable and faintly absurd.  But these are nit-picky quibbles.  WE WERE SOLDIERS is a damn fine movie.  I'll give Randy, who served two tours of duty in Vietnam, the last word: ""It may not be 'the' Vietnam movie.  I don't think there could ever be 'the' Vietnam movie.  But they get everything right.

""We Were Soldiers"" presents the story of a group of men with Gibson at the helm as a a personal drama.  The ""difference"" this film has from ""Platoon,"" or ""Hamburger Hill"" is that it approaches its story from the man and not the soldier.  We learn about the minds and the souls of the men in the uniforms.  It has been attempted in other films about Vietnam, but I think this one really hits the nail on the head (or gets as close as any I've seen).This is a gory film - but war isn't pretty.This is an emotional film - war is emotional.This is a frightening film.There is certainly an element of positive slant with regard to the U.S. - but by God - this film is an American film and it should have such a slant.  It isn't a documentary.  However, Wallace does do a good job of presenting the Viet Cong as humans with feelings and emotions too.  While not perfectly balanced, it is very even handed on the whole.As the viewer, you certainly empathize with the soldiers who do their duty and you admire the leadership and direction of their captain.

If you're going to see this film only for the big blasts, bombs, gunfire, and showbiz effects, then you'll be satisfied because there's plenty of that.  However, when I see a film advertized as being based on a true story, I want to go further than the explosions, and learn about the people.  This film offered little of that.Mel Gibson is our central character, Lt. Colonel Moore, and his wife is portrayed by Madeline Stowe.  Both these actors do wonders with the little they are given, yet even then, it is not enough to make us emotionally involved.  As the Lt. Col.'s wife, Stowe would host the wives' meetings at her house.  ""Issue one--where do we go shop when the commissary is out of something?  Does anyone know of a place to go?  Issue two--laundry.  The places on base are not reliable.  Does anyone know of someplace better?""I can't imagine women sitting around talking about such absolutely idiotic piffle when their husbands are out there in Vietnam getting shot at in a bloody massacre.  One could argue they were trying to focus on something else.  One could argue they were trying to deal with things within their own realm.  Okay, fine.  HOWEVER, when I DON'T see them crying, flipping out, talking about their husbands, talking about how much they love them, and are instead discussing laundry and shopping, I have to say a grand part of the equation is missing. The only time the wives were allowed to show emotion was when they were delivered the ever-so dreaded telegram informing them their husband is dead.  Are they not allowed to care for their men UNTIL then?Think of the opposite as well:  how would their husbands feel knowing while they is at war their wives' biggest concern was getting the whites clean, or finding tatter tots in the frozen foods section?  ""Yeah, I'm out here getting shot at so I can go back home and live with a woman who's biggest worry is having enough quarters for the laudromat.  Now THAT'S love."" Can you see how I say this film lacks credibility, IN SPITE of it being a true story?Wallace's script lacks emotion and believability, and makes us less able to mourn those who perish on the battle field.  Do I really care about these men?  Their wives don't seem to, so why should I?Also given the impossible task of making a character real are the very formidible Sam Elliot and Greg Kinnear.  Poor Sam.  He is a splendid actor, yet his dialogue was reduced to nothing but one-liner quips, usually with some sort of appropriate expletive in it--I wish I could list some of them in this review as they came off absolutely hilarious.  However,this man is a very capable actor--why would Wallace want to waste him like this?  Same with Kinnear, whose role is limited to being in a helicopter.  This Oscar-nominated talent is given only two major scenes in the entire film.  Waste!Like I said, if you like explosions, then see it.  If you want to be moved by the characters and learn something about Vietnam, perhaps renting Platoon will be a better option.",2,"Solid war scenes, but perspective and emotion needed help",1015113600,"03 3, 2002",2002,3208,"['Written', 'directed', 'Randall', 'Wallace', 'w/d', 'Man', 'Iron', 'Mask', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'yet', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'real', 'people', 'yet', 'people', 'are', 'as', 'two-dimensional', 'paper', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'film', 'only', 'big', 'blasts', 'bombs', 'gunfire', 'showbiz', 'effects', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'satisfied', 'plenty', 'However', 'when', 'see', 'film', 'advertized', 'being', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'want', 'go', 'further', 'explosions', 'learn', 'people', 'film', 'offered', 'little', 'that.Mel', 'Gibson', 'central', 'character', 'Lt', 'Colonel', 'Moore', 'wife', 'portrayed', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', 'Both', 'actors', 'do', 'wonders', 'little', 'are', 'given', 'yet', 'even', 'then', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'wife', 'Stowe', 'would', 'host', 'wives', 'meetings', 'house', 'Issue', 'one', 'where', 'do', 'go', 'shop', 'when', 'commissary', 'something', 'Does', 'anyone', 'know', 'place', 'go', 'Issue', 'two', 'laundry', 'places', 'base', 'are', 'not', 'reliable', 'anyone', 'know', 'someplace', 'better', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'women', 'sitting', 'talking', 'such', 'absolutely', 'idiotic', 'piffle', 'when', 'husbands', 'are', 'there', 'Vietnam', 'getting', 'shot', 'bloody', 'massacre', 'One', 'could', 'argue', 'were', 'trying', 'focus', 'something', 'else', 'One', 'could', 'argue', 'were', 'trying', 'deal', 'things', 'own', 'realm', 'Okay', 'fine', 'HOWEVER', 'when', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'see', 'crying', 'flipping', 'out', 'talking', 'husbands', 'talking', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'are', 'instead', 'discussing', 'laundry', 'shopping', 'have', 'say', 'grand', 'part', 'equation', 'missing', 'only', 'time', 'wives', 'were', 'allowed', 'show', 'emotion', 'was', 'when', 'were', 'delivered', 'ever-so', 'dreaded', 'telegram', 'informing', 'husband', 'dead', 'Are', 'not', 'allowed', 'care', 'men', 'then', 'Think', 'opposite', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'would', 'husbands', 'feel', 'knowing', 'war', 'wives', 'biggest', 'concern', 'was', 'getting', 'whites', 'clean', 'finding', 'tatter', 'tots', 'frozen', 'foods', 'section', 'Yeah', ""'m"", 'out', 'here', 'getting', 'shot', 'so', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'live', 'woman', 'who', 'biggest', 'worry', 'having', 'enough', 'quarters', 'laudromat', 'Now', 'THAT', 'love', 'Can', 'see', 'how', 'say', 'film', 'credibility', 'IN', 'SPITE', 'being', 'true', 'story', 'Wallace', 'script', 'emotion', 'believability', 'less', 'able', 'mourn', 'who', 'perish', 'battle', 'field', 'Do', 'really', 'care', 'men', 'wives', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'why', 'should', 'Also', 'given', 'impossible', 'task', 'making', 'character', 'real', 'are', 'very', 'formidible', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Poor', 'Sam', 'splendid', 'actor', 'yet', 'dialogue', 'was', 'reduced', 'nothing', 'one-liner', 'quips', 'usually', 'sort', 'appropriate', 'expletive', 'wish', 'could', 'list', 'review', 'came', 'off', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'However', 'man', 'very', 'capable', 'actor', 'why', 'would', 'Wallace', 'want', 'waste', 'Same', 'Kinnear', 'role', 'limited', 'being', 'helicopter', 'Oscar-nominated', 'talent', 'given', 'only', 'two', 'major', 'scenes', 'entire', 'film', 'Waste', 'said', 'like', 'explosions', 'then', 'see', 'want', 'be', 'moved', 'characters', 'learn', 'something', 'Vietnam', 'perhaps', 'renting', 'Platoon', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'option']",N/A

We Were Soldiers is a decent effort by director Wallace to tell a part of the story of the Vietnam War . It's basic message seems to be this : both Vietnamese and Americans had great casualties , both of them suffered . Yet what it fails to do is to actually present the paranoia of war and the psychological situation those young soldiers found themselfs into .""This is a war we will never understand "" says a voice at the beginning of the film and indeed it is . The US had send it's own kids to fight to an unknown country and to give their lives for a war taking place outside it's border , in a nation which didn't threaten the security nor the integrity of their homeland . Despite that though , the film has scenes of men dying on the battlefield while saying things like "" save those codes... i'm glad i'm dying for my country "" . These were young people full of prespectives and dreams who were facing the danger of not growing old , having children and live their lives they way they would want to , all for a war which on final analysis ... was not theirs . So how did they feel about being there ? Were they more patriotic or anxious and horrified ?It's been more than 20 years since Francis Ford Copolla had directed Apocalypse Now , the most horrific and challenging Vietnam story ever to be told . It hasn't even been a decade since Terence Mallick had made The Thin Red Line , one of the greatest war movies ever - a film which condemns war no matter who is fighting who - . We Were Soldiers is afraid to even touch subjects these films had deeply explored . Furthermore , Mel Gibson remains one of these few hollywood stars who are still unwilling to take a risk and play something else beside the hero or the cool guy while the Vietnamese share of pain is not even  being merely presented . It's understandable to want to honour the men of our country who lost their lives on the battlefield but what the world needs now is to actually face our history's mistakes and condemn war at every chance , even through blockbuster movies .",2,Cares more about pleasing than making audiences think,1033689600,"10 4, 2002",2002,2189,"['War', 'movies', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'just', 'entertaintment', '.They', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'more', 'maturity', 'seriousness', 'simply', 'deal', 'history', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'decent', 'effort', 'director', 'Wallace', 'tell', 'part', 'story', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'basic', 'message', 'be', 'Vietnamese', 'Americans', 'had', 'great', 'casualties', 'suffered', 'what', 'do', 'actually', 'present', 'paranoia', 'war', 'psychological', 'situation', 'young', 'soldiers', 'found', 'themselfs', 'war', 'will', 'never', 'understand', 'voice', 'beginning', 'film', 'indeed', 'US', 'had', 'send', 'own', 'kids', 'fight', 'unknown', 'country', 'give', 'lives', 'war', 'taking', 'place', 'border', 'nation', 'did', ""n't"", 'threaten', 'security', 'integrity', 'homeland', 'though', 'film', 'scenes', 'men', 'dying', 'battlefield', 'saying', 'things', 'save', 'codes', 'i', ""'m"", 'glad', 'i', ""'m"", 'dying', 'country', 'were', 'young', 'people', 'full', 'prespectives', 'dreams', 'who', 'were', 'facing', 'danger', 'not', 'growing', 'old', 'having', 'children', 'live', 'lives', 'way', 'would', 'want', 'war', 'final', 'analysis', 'was', 'not', 'theirs', 'how', 'did', 'feel', 'being', 'Were', 'more', 'patriotic', 'anxious', 'horrified', 'been', 'more', '20', 'years', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Copolla', 'had', 'directed', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'most', 'horrific', 'challenging', 'Vietnam', 'story', 'ever', 'be', 'told', ""n't"", 'even', 'been', 'decade', 'Terence', 'Mallick', 'had', 'made', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'one', 'greatest', 'war', 'movies', 'ever', 'film', 'war', 'matter', 'who', 'fighting', 'who', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'afraid', 'even', 'touch', 'subjects', 'films', 'had', 'deeply', 'explored', 'Furthermore', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'one', 'few', 'hollywood', 'stars', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'unwilling', 'take', 'risk', 'play', 'something', 'else', 'hero', 'cool', 'guy', 'Vietnamese', 'share', 'pain', 'not', 'even', 'being', 'merely', 'presented', 'understandable', 'want', 'honour', 'men', 'country', 'who', 'lost', 'lives', 'battlefield', 'what', 'world', 'now', 'actually', 'face', 'history', 'mistakes', 'condemn', 'war', 'chance', 'even', 'blockbuster', 'movies']",N/A

We see the North Vietnamese army, not as a ragtag militia force, but as a real army of thinking and dedicated men of conviction. Once on the ground, it is also interesting to see just how things escalate just within the confines of this engagement. I thought both Mel Gibson and Duong Don portrayed their characters as opposing commanders in the field as thinking men, as caring men and elevated this film beyond what could have been just another clich&eacute;d war film.

Yet a body count would still have been necessary to see which side suffered the greater losses.  Directing mass charges via waves of infantry in modern warfare was initially chronicled during the Korean conflict only later officially recognized as a 'War'.  And importantly, Hamburger Hill was also a battle before it was made into a movie also about a war named but never declared.As an overview, to modern war, film-making or Army life, ""We Were Soldiers"" merits full consideration.Mel Gibson turns in a flawless performance walking point on this sortie that became the first major battle of the Viet Nam conflict, later unofficially entitled a ""War.""One loses count of the important issues exposed in this courageous work.

Colonel Moore comes off looking pretty good.  Maybe he was, maybe that's why he made Lieutenant General.All I can say is Hollywood sure loves napalm (it isn't anywhere near as effective as shown in the movie; the Air Force must have paid to have the movie made.  All I can say is that I never had a Phantom stay on station longer than ten minutes and you had to cease firing all artillery and mortars before they'd come in.  All for one or two 500 pound bombs.  Just not worth it.Artillery on the other hand could crank out 60 105mm rounds per minute sustained fire with a battery of six howitzers. . That's with just with the direct support 105mm howitzers in direct support of the infantry battalion, not counting any 155mm or eight inchers.This movie is primarily about the Battle of the Ia Drang Valley.  As far as I could tell it was fairly realistic, except that:I never saw the first tracer round fired and no one showed an illumination fire mission.  Useful when you're fighting at night.  They did show the infantry firing their 81mm mortars and their four deuces.  I used these primarily for illumination fire mission, of course I was in Viet Nam somewhat later, in 1969 and 1970, and had some twenty batteries of artillery that could shoot for me.As an artillery officer I'm appalled at how poorly they used their artillery fire support.  I would have relieved my forward observer if that had been mine.  Maybe artillery needs to hire a better PR firm.All-in-all an entertaining movie.The movie is rated R for a reason.

Those who are not American, or who are not rabidly pro-American, might not like everything about this film, especially given the current political climate. There is a great deal of ""gung-ho"" in this film, which is absent from, say, Platoon. In fact, this is possibly the first serious Vietnam film since Green Berets not to hold a left-wing p.o.v. Thos who accused Black Hawk Down of being incrediblyt pro-American haven't seen We Were Soldiers!Although the film ostensibly shows both sides of the conflict (unlike BHD), it really doesn't show the Vietnamese point of view, except to depict them as essentially like the Americans; which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it seems forced. A film like Black Hawk Down is, to me, much less discomfiting; it does not pretend to show both sides, and can therefore concentrate on other matters.However, I would diasagree that this film is unrealistic in its depiction of combat. That was what war was like. The North Vietnamese might go down pretty easily, but that is becayse of America's superior technilogy. The body count really was that high!Besides, Americans are going down all the time, too, and at a tremendous rate.Not too sure about the close range of combat - that strikes me as a little dodgy, especially as the battle essentially takes place on an open field. I thought combat firefights were generally at 50 - 200 yards' range.The combat in this film is undoubtedly superb. The platoon tactics and ambuscades etc., as well as airstrikes, helicopter missions and so on, are depict3ed with loving accuracy. I thought many of thge more spectacular shots were CGI enhanced, but no - even the cyclonic napalm attacks are 100% real! The uniforms are also very realistic.Despite its gung-ho sensibilities, this film definitely does NOT glorify war. That should be made plain. The film is pretty much as anti-war as Platoon. The wounded men really look wounded; and some of the wounds are hideous indeed. Also, somehow the lack of a ""Private Ryanish"" grittiness to the film image somehow makes the carnage look worse. The litter and debris among the corpses really show how desperatr the fighting was in this battle - and how concentrated the fighting was, too.However, there are downsides to this film. The dialogue is forced, and often plays on sympathies that audiences might not share. There is much forced emotion in this film. The film lacks some coherence, and the pacing is far from perfect. Often there is a sense of repetition in the combat, taking away from the adrenaline rush. Also, the story of life back home seems emotionally forced too, lacking any grit.The lack of grit to the characters is possibly due to many of the characters' still being alive in real life. Given defamation laws, it isn't really possible to depict them with any flaws. Unfortunately, this makes even Hal Moore a little too perfect, a little unmemorable. The only character with any nasty traits that I remember is the guy who shouted at Snake (?) and nearly had a gunfight with him. He isn't even named.Incidentally, one reason why this film lacks the angst of most Vietnam films is that it is a battle between regulars.  In the early stages of the Vietnam War, it was still a war of volunteers. Hence there are no guerillas or burning villages here. We Were Soldiers presents the point of view of a regular soldier, whereas Platoon presents the story of conscripts v guerillas.",3,"Gung ho is still good, but with flaws...",1054166400,"05 29, 2003",2003,3469,"['Japanese', 'gentleman', 'below', 'quite', 'correct', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'American', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'rabidly', 'pro-American', 'might', 'not', 'everything', 'film', 'especially', 'given', 'current', 'political', 'climate', 'great', 'deal', 'gung-ho', 'film', 'absent', 'say', 'Platoon', 'fact', 'possibly', 'first', 'serious', 'Vietnam', 'film', 'Green', 'Berets', 'not', 'hold', 'left-wing', 'p.o.v', 'Thos', 'who', 'accused', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'being', 'incrediblyt', 'pro-American', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'film', 'ostensibly', 'sides', 'conflict', 'BHD', 'really', ""n't"", 'show', 'Vietnamese', 'point', 'view', 'depict', 'essentially', 'Americans', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'forced', 'film', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'much', 'less', 'discomfiting', 'not', 'pretend', 'show', 'sides', 'can', 'therefore', 'concentrate', 'other', 'matters.However', 'would', 'diasagree', 'film', 'unrealistic', 'depiction', 'combat', 'was', 'what', 'war', 'was', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'might', 'go', 'down', 'pretty', 'easily', 'becayse', 'America', 'superior', 'technilogy', 'body', 'count', 'really', 'was', 'high', 'Americans', 'are', 'going', 'time', 'too', 'tremendous', 'rate.Not', 'too', 'sure', 'close', 'range', 'combat', 'little', 'dodgy', 'especially', 'battle', 'essentially', 'place', 'open', 'field', 'thought', 'combat', 'firefights', 'were', 'generally', '50', '200', 'yards', 'range.The', 'combat', 'film', 'undoubtedly', 'superb', 'platoon', 'tactics', 'ambuscades', 'etc.', 'as', 'well', 'airstrikes', 'helicopter', 'missions', 'so', 'are', 'depict3ed', 'loving', 'accuracy', 'thought', 'many', 'thge', 'more', 'spectacular', 'shots', 'were', 'CGI', 'enhanced', 'even', 'cyclonic', 'napalm', 'attacks', 'are', '100', '%', 'real', 'uniforms', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'realistic.Despite', 'gung-ho', 'sensibilities', 'film', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'glorify', 'war', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'plain', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'anti-war', 'Platoon', 'wounded', 'men', 'really', 'look', 'wounded', 'wounds', 'are', 'hideous', 'indeed', 'Also', 'somehow', 'lack', 'Private', 'Ryanish', 'grittiness', 'film', 'image', 'somehow', 'carnage', 'look', 'worse', 'litter', 'debris', 'corpses', 'really', 'show', 'how', 'desperatr', 'fighting', 'was', 'battle', 'how', 'concentrated', 'fighting', 'was', 'too.However', 'are', 'downsides', 'film', 'dialogue', 'forced', 'often', 'sympathies', 'audiences', 'might', 'not', 'share', 'much', 'forced', 'emotion', 'film', 'film', 'coherence', 'pacing', 'far', 'perfect', 'sense', 'repetition', 'combat', 'taking', 'away', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'Also', 'story', 'life', 'back', 'home', 'emotionally', 'forced', 'too', 'lacking', 'grit.The', 'lack', 'grit', 'characters', 'possibly', 'due', 'many', 'characters', 'still', 'being', 'alive', 'real', 'life', 'Given', 'defamation', 'laws', ""n't"", 'really', 'possible', 'depict', 'flaws', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'Hal', 'Moore', 'little', 'too', 'perfect', 'little', 'unmemorable', 'only', 'character', 'nasty', 'traits', 'remember', 'guy', 'who', 'shouted', 'Snake', 'nearly', 'had', 'gunfight', ""n't"", 'even', 'named.Incidentally', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'angst', 'most', 'Vietnam', 'films', 'battle', 'regulars', 'early', 'stages', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'was', 'still', 'war', 'volunteers', 'Hence', 'are', 'guerillas', 'burning', 'villages', 'here', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'point', 'view', 'regular', 'soldier', 'whereas', 'Platoon', 'story', 'conscripts', 'v', 'guerillas']",N/A

705757,A1GBMGSDDG7BFL,B000068TPN,James Crouch,"[1, 1]","I went into my first viewing of We Were Soldiers with high expectations(I have seen it twice now, and plan to see it again) Being a Mel Gibson fan, as well as a war movie aficionado, I could hardly wait to see this screen interpretation of retired Lt. General(Colonel at the time of the battle)Harold Moore's novel entitled We Were Soldiers Once...and Young, a true account of the first battle of the Vietnam War which involved American soldiers in combat. The movie covers the events leading up to the battle, including the massacre of a French regiment in 1954, 11 years before the battle takes place, which plays a role in Col. Moore's battle strategy against a much larger Vietnamese army. The story develops several important characters. Gibson delivers another rock-solid performance as Col. Moore, a highly intelligent and seasoned commander whose life is guided by a firm dedication to his family and his country. A quick note: Mel Gibson is seriously considering retiring from acting to focus on producing, which will allow him to spend more time with his wife and seven kids. His next movie, Signs(from the wrier/director of The Sixth Sense, which is done filming, may be his last as a lead actor, so relish this one if enoying watching his performances. Madeline Stowe is excellent as his wife, Julie. Some of the most emotional moments in the movie occur when Mrs. Moore takes on the difficult task of informing some of the other wives of their husbands' deaths in battle. Sam Elliott(Tombstone) turns in an excellent performance as Col Moore's 2nd in command, Sgt. Major Plumley. Chris Klein and Keri Russell do a fine job as Lt. Jack Geoghegan and his wife Barbara, who have a child shortly before the fighting begins. Greg Kinnear once again delivers as Major Bruce Crandall, a helicopter pilot who provides invaluable assistance by transporting supplies and troops, as well as provoding cover fire under extreme pressure. And last but not least is Barry Pepper, who follows up his amazing portrayal of Roger Maris in 61* with another wonderful performance as Joe Galloway, a photograper who risks his life in an attempt to help himself(and his country) understand the nature of  a war that divided this country more than any before it had ever done. We Were Soldiers does an excellent job of portraying the American side, but it really distinguishes itself by giving a face(as well as respect) to the Vietnamese soldiers who fought and died along with many American soldiers. Many movies about the this war villianize the Vietnamese people, but this movie takes an important step by showing us a glimpse of the actual people on the other side. While we obviously  give unyielding support to our own soldiers, it is also important to remember that the soldiers on the other side were real people who belived strongly enough in their cause to give their lives for it. We Were Soldiers does an excellent job of creating extremely intense and realistic battle scenes. This movie is not for the squeamish, but if you're like me, you want the battle scenes to be as realistic as possible in order to give the most accurate portrayal of what really happened to the men out there. We Were Soldiers is a story about a group of men showing extreme courage and dedication to one another under the most dire circumstances. While one might say that this is a fairly common theme in war movies, let us not forget that this is a TRUE story. The men who died on the battlefield weren't just fictional characters, they were real people with families who died serving their country. These men became a family themselves, and went to extraordinary legnths to help one another. Their dedication and sacrifice  truly somthing to be respected and admired by everyone. We Were Soldiers is an excellent film, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the Vietnam War and the men who fought in it.",5,They Were Soldiers.....and Heroes,1015545600,"03 8, 2002",2002,3911,"['went', 'first', 'viewing', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'high', 'expectations', 'have', 'seen', 'twice', 'now', 'plan', 'see', 'again', 'Being', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'fan', 'as', 'well', 'war', 'movie', 'aficionado', 'could', 'hardly', 'wait', 'see', 'screen', 'interpretation', 'retired', 'Lt.', 'General', 'Colonel', 'time', 'battle', 'Harold', 'Moore', 'novel', 'entitled', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'Once', 'Young', 'true', 'account', 'first', 'battle', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'involved', 'American', 'soldiers', 'combat', 'movie', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'battle', 'including', 'massacre', 'French', 'regiment', '1954', '11', 'years', 'battle', 'place', 'role', 'Col.', 'Moore', 'battle', 'strategy', 'much', 'larger', 'Vietnamese', 'army', 'story', 'several', 'important', 'characters', 'Gibson', 'rock-solid', 'performance', 'Col.', 'Moore', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'seasoned', 'commander', 'life', 'guided', 'firm', 'dedication', 'family', 'country', 'quick', 'note', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'seriously', 'considering', 'retiring', 'acting', 'focus', 'producing', 'will', 'allow', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'wife', 'seven', 'kids', 'next', 'movie', 'Signs', 'wrier/director', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'done', 'filming', 'may', 'be', 'last', 'lead', 'actor', 'so', 'relish', 'one', 'enoying', 'watching', 'performances', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', 'excellent', 'wife', 'Julie', 'most', 'emotional', 'moments', 'movie', 'occur', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'Moore', 'difficult', 'task', 'informing', 'other', 'wives', 'husbands', 'deaths', 'battle', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'Tombstone', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Col', 'Moore', '2nd', 'command', 'Sgt', 'Major', 'Plumley', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'Lt.', 'Jack', 'Geoghegan', 'wife', 'Barbara', 'who', 'have', 'child', 'shortly', 'fighting', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'once', 'again', 'delivers', 'Major', 'Bruce', 'Crandall', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'who', 'invaluable', 'assistance', 'transporting', 'supplies', 'troops', 'as', 'well', 'provoding', 'cover', 'fire', 'extreme', 'pressure', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'who', 'up', 'amazing', 'portrayal', 'Roger', 'Maris', '61*', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Joe', 'Galloway', 'photograper', 'who', 'life', 'attempt', 'help', 'country', 'understand', 'nature', 'war', 'divided', 'country', 'more', 'had', 'ever', 'done', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'American', 'side', 'really', 'giving', 'face', 'as', 'well', 'respect', 'Vietnamese', 'soldiers', 'who', 'fought', 'died', 'many', 'American', 'soldiers', 'Many', 'movies', 'war', 'villianize', 'Vietnamese', 'people', 'movie', 'important', 'step', 'showing', 'glimpse', 'actual', 'people', 'other', 'side', 'obviously', 'give', 'unyielding', 'support', 'own', 'soldiers', 'also', 'important', 'remember', 'soldiers', 'other', 'side', 'were', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'belived', 'strongly', 'enough', 'cause', 'give', 'lives', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'excellent', 'job', 'creating', 'extremely', 'intense', 'realistic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'movie', 'not', 'squeamish', ""'re"", 'want', 'battle', 'scenes', 'be', 'as', 'realistic', 'possible', 'order', 'give', 'most', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'men', 'out', 'there', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'story', 'group', 'men', 'showing', 'extreme', 'courage', 'dedication', 'one', 'most', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'one', 'might', 'say', 'fairly', 'common', 'theme', 'war', 'movies', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'TRUE', 'story', 'men', 'who', 'died', 'battlefield', 'were', ""n't"", 'just', 'fictional', 'characters', 'were', 'real', 'people', 'families', 'who', 'died', 'serving', 'country', 'men', 'became', 'family', 'went', 'extraordinary', 'legnths', 'help', 'one', 'dedication', 'sacrifice', 'truly', 'somthing', 'be', 'respected', 'admired', 'everyone', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'excellent', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'know', 'more', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'men', 'who', 'fought']",N/A

I haven't read the book, so I can't verify this, but the title to me points out the fact that the soldiers in this war were, in fact, soldiers: most did not have much policy-making authority, and did not choose to engage in what many felt was an ... unnecessary war.  They were not involved in politics.  Instead, they were there to do what they had been required to do.  They were soldiers.  It also brought to the fore how non-soldiers, through chance, became soldiers themselves.The cinematography of this movie is beautiful, and it is full of gripping scenes.  It helps viewers to get a feel for what it must have been like to be there.  When the soldiers are pinned down, surrounded, and outnumbered, it is a very tense film to watch.  In fact, the action scenes are uniformly good, and the acting is excellent also.  We Were Soldiers also points out some historical truths about the war that most don't realize, such as the scene when the soldiers are being taught how helicopters will be used to transport them into and out of firefights.  Most don't realize that this was the first engagement of its kind, and it's instructive to watch the soldiers react to the danger it presents....  From a purely technical standpoint, it provides some relief from the unadulterated action of the movie, much as comedy scenes in Shakespeare's tragedies do.

705764,A3EZD11AFUX23K,B000068TPN,Jason P. Gold,"[0, 1]","If you liked ""Black Hawk Down,"" you should like this movie. They are very similar in that they both tell the story of one battle. BHD re-creates the 1993 American siege of the Somalian warlord Aidid's stronghold city of Mogadishu, where a 45-minute mission turned into a 16-hour urban war. In BHD, two Black Hawk helicopters were downed by rocket-propelled grenades. There, the U.S. soldiers, unwilling to leave anyone behind, were attacked from all sides by armed by supporters of Somali warlord Aidid. ""We Were Soldiers"" is the story of the United States first major battle with the North Vietnamese army. Similarly, WWS is little more than the story of one battle. It involves a contingent of 400 American soldiers from the American Air Cavelry on the bottom of a hill, who for several days fight off waves of several thousand NVA soldiers who were hidden atop the hill in an underground bunker complex. The film has only two parts which are not the battle. The first is in the beginning of the film, where we are introduced to Lt. Col Harold Moore and his family. We, the audience, are also informed Lt. Col. Moore is to implement new US tactics using helicopters as cavelry to ferry men and supplies in and out of battle. The other part, interspersed with battle scenes, has Lt. Moore's wife delivering telegrams to the wives of those soldiers killed in the battle. There is little more to this film.On the positive side, the performances are very good. Mel Gibson makes the film worth seeing. He does an excellent job of making Moore interesting, portraying his religious beliefs, family values and ethical standards. The last are exemplified by his dedication to his troops by refusing to obey orders to leave the battle to debrief his superiors. The filmmakers do a very good job of making the viewer see the overwhelming odds facing the soldiers and their fear.On the negative side, except for Gibson's portrayal of Lt. Col Harold Moore, none of the characters are given any depth. There is no sense of conflict between characters; the Vietnamese army charging down the hill is little more than an attacking horde of aliens in a computer game. A game of Space Invaders has almost as much plot.

705766,A1WIZ78S4T2AP2,B000068TPN,J.D.,"[7, 8]","Most movies I've seen about the Vietnam War have been depressing. ""Platoon"" and ""Hamburger Hill"" come to mind, as they are there to remind us that Vietnam was a real shock to us back in the 60's and 70's. Yes, we remember we pulled out, lost if you want to say, but I don't go to a movie to get depressed. Randall Wallace's ""We Were Soldiers"" is not a depressing movie by any means, but shows that heroes were made in a war we look down on even today.From the book ""We Were Soldiers...And Young"", the main character is Lt. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), a family man put in charge of, for the most part, green officers and men. The film also stars Sam Eliott, Chris Klein, Madeline Stowe, Keri Russell, and Berry Pepper. The majority of the movie takes place in Vietnam, where Moore and his 7th Cavalry fights 4000 NVA's while there are only 300 with Moore.The battle scenes (which comprise the movie pretty much) are gory. Now, this isn't the goriest battle sequences you've ever seen, but it ranks number three in my book (""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" taking the other two) for realistic wounds and such. The battle is hot and exciting, featuring infantry, air force, artillery, the whole deal. Some of the most frightening scenes come at night, when we see how close the NVA's really get to the lines. Wallace effectively knows when to change scenes at different places of the battle, and the changing it to back home with the soldiers' wives.Gibson of course performs admirably here. He plays Moore to detail as not only a father of seven, but a father of three hundred. Sam Eliott was casted brilliantly as the gruff Sgt. Major, Barry Pepper as the journalist who would write the book along with Moore, Klein as an upcoming platoon leader that meets his demise, and Russell and Stowe clean up at home. Once again a great ensemble cast, and a great film. A little lengthy, but this film makes it worthwhile. ""We Were Soldiers"" is a rather positive look on Vietnam, thankfully conveyed by Wallace and Gibson.I knew that Wallace had written the flop ""Pearl Harbor"", but the last time that he and Gibson got together was ""Braveheart"", and we all know how successful that movie was.

705770,A1VTHUZIN04QQW,B000068TPN,Jeremiah J. Timmins,"[18, 21]","""We Were Soldiers"" is the best war film to come out in a long, long time.  It's non-fiction without patriotic propoganda or nostalgic, or preachiness, like 'Pearl Harbor,' and 'Saving Private Ryan.'  Despite the comments of some reviewers, this movie wasn't promoting patriotism.  It was a highly technical portrayal of modern battle, and the concequences of sending your troops into battle.  If anything, the movie was somewhat of a tragedy, because despite the altruism of Lt. Col Hal Moore and his men, their actions would ultimately be in vain.The movie was a refreshing 'Nam film because it focused on the war at its very outset, when the troops being sent there didn't think of the war we do now.  At the time, it was just another American war in which we'll go, fight for our country, and come out victorious, like always.  But even in this movie, you can see where politics and institutionalized stupidity were creeping into the Army.  Just look for the scene, when Moore is desperately needed on the ground to, A: Conduct the battle, B: Matintain the morale, trust and confidence of his men, and C: for moral reasons, his commander tries to recall him to Saigon so Gen. Westmoreland can have a 'briefing.'  WTF?  It's a credit to Moore's character and leadership qualities that he told the brass to go screw themselves.  Doing so meant he put the lives of his men above his own, and above his own career.As a military vet, I knew a lot of officers who would have jumped at the chance to get out of that hell hole.  Fortunately, I knew an equal amount who would have said, ""You want a briefing?  Fly down here and we'll 'brief' you!""  The latter types were the only ones who instilled loyalty in their men.  The fish rots from the head.  If you have a bunch of great guys with a lousy leader, you're going to have a lousy unit, no matter what.  But even if you have a bunch of jerks with a great leader, you can have a great unit.  Moore's presence on the battlefield was probably essential to their victory.  When troops are patted on the back by their CO, it's a huge boost in confidence and morale.  When the CO is never around, or even worse, is gone, the rumor mill starts flying, troops feel like 'they' (the officers) aren't trustworthy, and that the soldiers are fighting for the wrong reasons.  Moore was the type of commander who would never let his troops think about the battalion terms of 'us' (enlisted) and 'them' (officers).  Moore's troops thought of the battalion as 'us.'I saw a couple discrepencies in the film at first glance.  1 - a soldier getting on the bus in Georgia with a magazine in his rifle.  No way.  2 - I'm 95% sure they had metal canteens in 65, but they had plastic ones in the movie.Also, I'm not sure why the soldiers didn't dig in on the perimeter.  They maintained a perimeter for a long time, overnight even, and in my training we would always dig, dig, dig anytime you stop and hold turf.I liked how the Vietnamese were portrayed.  Despite having no air support and no artillery they fought as well as they could, and tried to 'hug the belt' of the Americans.  This lead the Americans to call in air support on themselves, leading to casualties.  It was good when they showed how scared the Vietnamese were, because in most movies they're portrayed as being somehow ghost-like, inhuman, when in fact they were damn scared, just like our guys.  Going against American firepower, not to mention guys who are physically up to twice your weight and on average six inches taller, took a lot of nerve.Overall a great film.  It showed the US Military in its 60s prime, the tragic consequnces of using military force, and it also showed the home front, and how military wives are actually part of the battles we fight.

705774,A3IH2L4B5VOA59,B000068TPN,"J. Houzet ""wozamoya""","[6, 7]","We Were Soldiers is one of the best movies on the Vietnam War I have seen. It is an antidote to such cynical perspectives as Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, The Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now. Those were all very well made films, but obviously colored by the various directors' politics in general and disdain for the Vietnam War in particular.Nobody longs for war (except if you're crazy), but We Were Soldiers displays how men of integrity and with a natural patriotism will fight and die for their country. Based on the true story of the first battle between American soldiers and North Vietnamese troops in 1965, We Were Soldiers is useful in showing the very early stages of the war. We are given a bigger scope of the conflict in the opening segment which shows how the French were finally driven out of Indo-China in the '50s.During the Cold War, the United States felt an obligation to fight against the spread of Communism and prevent the Domino Effect of South East Asian countries falling one by one to Communist control. So with the French gone, America made a stand in Vietnam, probably with the right motivations, but in a war that was to prove too costly in terms of lives lost and loss of national resolve back home.But in this first battle, we get the feeling the war could have had a very different ending. An American air cavalry regiment under the command of Col. Hal Moore (brilliantly portrayed by Mel Gibson) is dropped off in enemy territory with orders to hold their ground. The North Vietnamese have the advantage of numbers, knowing the land, and with the high ground position. They come in waves against the American troops, but are fought back each time. These battle scenes are exceedingly well shot. You can feel the bloody shock of the close combat. At one point, a civilian war correspondent is unable to be an observer anymore and takes up a rifle alongside the soldiers.The days of conflict are interlaced with scenes of the military wives back home, particularly Col. Moore's wife (the luminous Madeleine Stowe), as she takes on the burden of telling other women on the base when their husbands have been killed in action. These are deeply moving scenes. I applaud this movie for being able to incorporate the effects of war on loved ones back home in such a personal, non-political way.We Were Soldiers also takes the courageous path of not refraining from showing Col. Moore's very real faith. He was a devout Catholic, and we see him in conversations and prayer with his family and a junior officer (Chris Klein, in a very pleasing understated role). Moore cares deeply about his men, a stark contrast to the self-absorbed, cowardly or mentally unhinged portrayals of officers we see in other Vietnam movies.Likewise, the North Vietnamese soldiers are not caricatures. We see glimpses of them as human beings with loved ones too, and with an earnest conviction on the part of their commanding officer that their cause is just and that they will prevail.I recommend seeing this movie together with A Bright Shining Lie, which could possibly be understood as an anti-war film, but which was valuable for its documentary type scope of the entire duration of the war, showing how incredibly short-sighted strategy, growing cynicism and even a senior military commander's personal life can shape the outcome of a war.",5,Mel Gibson in excellent role,1072742400,"12 30, 2003",2003,3347,"['Were', 'Soldiers', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'have', 'seen', 'antidote', 'such', 'cynical', 'perspectives', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'Platoon', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'films', 'obviously', 'colored', 'various', 'directors', 'politics', 'general', 'disdain', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'particular.Nobody', 'longs', 'war', ""'re"", 'crazy', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'how', 'men', 'integrity', 'natural', 'patriotism', 'will', 'fight', 'die', 'country', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'first', 'battle', 'American', 'soldiers', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'troops', '1965', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'useful', 'showing', 'very', 'early', 'stages', 'war', 'are', 'given', 'bigger', 'scope', 'conflict', 'opening', 'segment', 'how', 'French', 'were', 'finally', 'driven', 'out', 'Indo-China', ""'50s.During"", 'Cold', 'War', 'United', 'States', 'felt', 'obligation', 'fight', 'spread', 'Communism', 'prevent', 'Domino', 'Effect', 'South', 'East', 'Asian', 'countries', 'falling', 'one', 'one', 'Communist', 'control', 'So', 'French', 'gone', 'America', 'made', 'stand', 'Vietnam', 'probably', 'right', 'motivations', 'war', 'was', 'prove', 'too', 'costly', 'terms', 'lives', 'lost', 'loss', 'national', 'resolve', 'back', 'home.But', 'first', 'battle', 'get', 'feeling', 'war', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'different', 'ending', 'American', 'air', 'cavalry', 'regiment', 'command', 'Col.', 'Hal', 'Moore', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'dropped', 'off', 'enemy', 'territory', 'orders', 'hold', 'ground', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'have', 'advantage', 'numbers', 'knowing', 'land', 'high', 'ground', 'position', 'come', 'waves', 'American', 'troops', 'are', 'fought', 'back', 'time', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'shot', 'can', 'feel', 'bloody', 'shock', 'close', 'combat', 'one', 'point', 'civilian', 'war', 'correspondent', 'unable', 'be', 'observer', 'anymore', 'up', 'rifle', 'soldiers.The', 'days', 'conflict', 'are', 'interlaced', 'scenes', 'military', 'wives', 'back', 'home', 'particularly', 'Col.', 'Moore', 'wife', 'luminous', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'burden', 'telling', 'other', 'women', 'base', 'when', 'husbands', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'action', 'are', 'deeply', 'moving', 'scenes', 'applaud', 'movie', 'being', 'able', 'incorporate', 'effects', 'war', 'loved', 'ones', 'back', 'home', 'such', 'personal', 'non-political', 'way.We', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'also', 'courageous', 'path', 'not', 'refraining', 'showing', 'Col.', 'Moore', 'very', 'real', 'faith', 'was', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'see', 'conversations', 'prayer', 'family', 'junior', 'officer', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'very', 'pleasing', 'understated', 'role', 'Moore', 'deeply', 'men', 'stark', 'contrast', 'self-absorbed', 'cowardly', 'mentally', 'unhinged', 'portrayals', 'officers', 'see', 'other', 'Vietnam', 'movies.Likewise', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'soldiers', 'are', 'not', 'caricatures', 'see', 'glimpses', 'human', 'beings', 'loved', 'ones', 'too', 'earnest', 'conviction', 'part', 'commanding', 'officer', 'cause', 'just', 'will', 'prevail.I', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'movie', 'together', 'A', 'Bright', 'Shining', 'Lie', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'understood', 'anti-war', 'film', 'was', 'valuable', 'documentary', 'type', 'scope', 'entire', 'duration', 'war', 'showing', 'how', 'incredibly', 'short-sighted', 'strategy', 'growing', 'cynicism', 'even', 'senior', 'military', 'commander', 'personal', 'life', 'can', 'shape', 'outcome', 'war']",N/A

705776,AZ0T3JFXJMSPK,B000068TPN,J. Lyda,"[1, 5]","This was a good movie, but a movie with Mel Gibson, about Vietnam, demands special attention. Two things constantly bothered me, one silly the other important. First, Mel's Southern accent just did not work and I had to stifle a chuckle each time he tried to sound like someone from my home town. Second, the constant close-quarter, almost hand-to-hand nature of the fighting shown in this picture, in broad daylight, is inconsistent with everything I have come to understand about Vietnam and modern warfare. Modern weapons are so lethal that soldiers rarely get close enough to even see who they have shot. The American troops were constantly running around and standing up in plain view of dozens of machine gun firing NVA. That is not consistent with survival instinct or military training. So I challenge the technical accuracy of the movie on this point...Movies like ""Platoon"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" express the dark side of that time, and there was plenty of it - - In total I'll take ""Blackhawk Down"" for shear intensity and the portrayal of the incredible professionalism of the US soldier. I'll take ""Saving Private Ryan"" for the acting and that incredible opening scene.

705779,A2GOTY2STOMEAU,B000068TPN,John G. Gleeson Sr.,"[10, 11]","This is another of the recent trend ( ""Blackhawk Down"", ""Behind Enemy Lines"") to make war movies based on true stories. Here, the war is in Vietnam, and as most know, it was a war that sharply divided the Country (in fact, the last ""fuss"" that I engaged in was in objection to a fellow that needed a bath & haircut who was cussing out a soldier in an airport). This film operates at several levels. First is the basic (if one can describe such courage and dedication under that rubric) story of LTC Hal Moore and his airmobile regiment in the Ia Drang Valley, called ""the valley of death"", in 1965. More important to ,me, at least, was the depiction of Moore as a commander DEEPLY committed to his men, as well as to his mission. There is also the aspect of a clear sense of failed support, both from Moore's superiors and from the Federal Government. Finally, there is a moving segment that shows the effects on the home front, as casualty telegrams are received by the soldiers' families. To tell more would spoil the unfolding story of this excellent film. It is a very realistic reinactment, and as such is an effective reminder as to what happens when we ask our young men and women to go in harm's way. Soldiers don't make policy or start wars; they follow orders and go where they are sent. It has been very gratifying to see the development of Mel Gibson as an actor since the ""Mad Max"" days, and his performance here is simply compelling. All of the cast perform well, but I make special note of Madeline Stowe's outstanding portrayal of LTC Moore's wife; she is a beautiful woman and an excellent actress; if you are not moved by her performance, you lack a heart. Also, the very talented Sam Elliott is perfect in the role of Moore's VERY tough Sargeant Major. Visually, the film is fantastic: the combat scenes are gut-wrenching, rivalling those in ""Blackhawk Down"". Sonically, the disc offers Dolby 5.1EX, so be prepared for complaints from the neighbors. I underscore the realism of the combat scenes. While such are always ""troubling"" to watch in the sense of the reality of war, if you, as a potential viewer, cannot handle such scenes, pass on. However, ""We Were Soldiers"" is an outstanding tribute to the brave men and women who followed orders in the Vietnam War, and, I suspect, to the men and women in uniform today.

And it's always easy to criticize, after the fact, the tactics that were used in the battle.  It was a new type of warfare, and it was the first time those tactics were used to that extent.  What also made this an enjoyable movie is that it wasn't made from an ugly American type viewpoint.

705791,A1LP6O85Z894GT,B000068TPN,"J. Remington ""John Remington""","[3, 3]","Perhaps the contemporary war film is becoming a tired and near exhausted genre in its current form. After the watershed ""Saving Private Ryan"", there really may not be much new to say in a large scale war epic.One might certainly gain this impression based upon the many negative reviews of both ""Ryan"" and this film. Those souls have attempted to brand these two films as cliched and retro-patriotically simplistic. Watching this film as well as listening to director/writer Randall Wallace's superb audio commentary, it becomes apparent that ""Ryan"" and ""We Were Soldiers"" can possibly be labeled as cliched because they are both honest and realistic.  We find an example of this in the dialouge uttered by the dying soldiers who often proclaim ""Tell my wife I love her."" Yes we have heard this time and time again, but that just happens to be frequently what soldiers say in their final moments. Unfortunately when we see the same truth shown too many times, it does become often cliched and redundant.But what else does one want in an honest war film? Perhaps some folks deride this and ""Ryan"" in favor of the pretentious new agey pseudo Steinbeck-lite ramblings of Terrence Malick's beautifully photographed but muddled, cold and pompous piece of snobbish fluff that was ""The Thin Red Line"".But I digress, ""We Were Soldiers"", missing becoming a classic because of its unfortunate timing in coming after ""Ryan"" still remains a very very good film.I particulary appreciated Wallace's inclusion of footage that raises the humanity and the courage of the NVA regulars. These are not Hollywood stereotyped villians. These soldiers are equally as brave, pious and devoted as the American soldiers. Wallace achieves this balance without resorting to any political posturing. This becomes especially apparent in many scenes, including a remarkably touching quiet scene in which Gibson's (delivering a fine performance) Hal Moore aknowledges the fact that the enemy prays to Diety as well.I also value this film's structure. ""We Were Soldiers"" shows the homefront as equally as the battlefield. It shows the pre war experience as well as the war and the post war time as well. Wallace, utilizing the real veterans of this battle, seeks to humanize the reality of the war. Again, some might find much of these sequences quaint and simplistic. But they remain true.This film also avoids the cynical, nihilistic and ugly previous portaits of Vietnam soldiers that bombarded us in the '70's, '80's and early '90's. It seemed that the films of DePalma, Stone (except for his excellent ""Born On The Forth Of July""- which might be his most balanced film) sought to tear apart and demonize America through the Vietnam soldier. This film seeks again to give them some dignity and honor and finds it in their devotion to their fellow men (and honor of enemy!).What makes ""We Were Soldiers"" a must own as opposed to a simply must see, is Paramount's (usually incredibly stingy in their packaging) inclusion of a great many extras. As stated earlier, Wallace's commentary is most illuminative. Many of the deleted scenes flesh out the emotional and intellectual impact of the film and are worth watching as well.Give this film a try. It is definately a film that honors the veterans of the war. From both sides of the battlefield.",4,A very very good film,1031270400,"09 6, 2002",2002,3312,"['Perhaps', 'contemporary', 'war', 'film', 'becoming', 'tired', 'exhausted', 'genre', 'current', 'form', 'watershed', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'really', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'much', 'new', 'say', 'large', 'scale', 'war', 'epic.One', 'might', 'certainly', 'gain', 'impression', 'based', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Ryan', 'film', 'souls', 'have', 'attempted', 'brand', 'two', 'films', 'cliched', 'retro-patriotically', 'simplistic', 'Watching', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'listening', 'director/writer', 'Randall', 'Wallace', 'superb', 'audio', 'commentary', 'apparent', 'Ryan', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'can', 'possibly', 'be', 'labeled', 'cliched', 'are', 'honest', 'realistic', 'find', 'example', 'dialouge', 'uttered', 'dying', 'soldiers', 'who', 'often', 'proclaim', 'Tell', 'wife', 'love', 'have', 'heard', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'just', 'be', 'frequently', 'what', 'soldiers', 'say', 'final', 'moments', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'see', 'same', 'truth', 'shown', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'become', 'often', 'cliched', 'redundant.But', 'what', 'else', 'one', 'want', 'honest', 'war', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'folks', 'deride', 'Ryan', 'favor', 'pretentious', 'new', 'agey', 'pseudo', 'Steinbeck-lite', 'ramblings', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'muddled', 'cold', 'pompous', 'piece', 'snobbish', 'fluff', 'was', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', '.But', 'digress', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'missing', 'becoming', 'classic', 'unfortunate', 'timing', 'coming', 'Ryan', 'still', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'film.I', 'particulary', 'appreciated', 'Wallace', 'inclusion', 'footage', 'humanity', 'courage', 'NVA', 'regulars', 'are', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'stereotyped', 'villians', 'soldiers', 'are', 'equally', 'brave', 'pious', 'devoted', 'American', 'soldiers', 'Wallace', 'balance', 'resorting', 'political', 'posturing', 'especially', 'apparent', 'many', 'scenes', 'including', 'remarkably', 'touching', 'quiet', 'scene', 'Gibson', 'delivering', 'fine', 'performance', 'Hal', 'Moore', 'fact', 'enemy', 'Diety', 'well.I', 'also', 'value', 'film', 'structure', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'homefront', 'as', 'equally', 'battlefield', 'pre', 'war', 'experience', 'as', 'well', 'war', 'post', 'war', 'time', 'well', 'Wallace', 'utilizing', 'real', 'veterans', 'battle', 'humanize', 'reality', 'war', 'Again', 'might', 'find', 'much', 'sequences', 'quaint', 'simplistic', 'remain', 'true.This', 'film', 'also', 'cynical', 'nihilistic', 'ugly', 'previous', 'portaits', 'Vietnam', 'soldiers', 'bombarded', ""'70"", 'early', ""'90"", 'seemed', 'films', 'DePalma', 'Stone', 'excellent', 'Born', 'Forth', 'July', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'balanced', 'film', 'sought', 'tear', 'apart', 'demonize', 'America', 'Vietnam', 'soldier', 'film', 'again', 'give', 'dignity', 'honor', 'devotion', 'fellow', 'men', 'honor', 'enemy', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'must', 'own', 'opposed', 'simply', 'must', 'see', 'Paramount', 'usually', 'incredibly', 'stingy', 'packaging', 'inclusion', 'great', 'many', 'extras', 'stated', 'earlier', 'Wallace', 'commentary', 'most', 'illuminative', 'Many', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'flesh', 'out', 'emotional', 'intellectual', 'impact', 'film', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'well.Give', 'film', 'try', 'definately', 'film', 'veterans', 'war', 'sides', 'battlefield']",N/A

705793,A25RN8X70DSZLU,B000068TPN,JRP,"[0, 0]","I'm back with a movie review these reviews have to do with movies that were released in either 1992 or 2002. This is 2002 in film We Were Soldiers. This movie I saw around the same time as Black Hawk Down this mvoie has to do with a different conflict The Vietnam War. We Were Soldiers was directed by Randall Wallace he directed Man In The Iron Mask so I'd say that this is his best film. It stars Mel Gibson as Colonel Hal Moore, Sam Elliot as Major Basil Plumley, Barry Pepper as Joe Galloway, Chris Klein as 2nd Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan, Greg Kinnar as Major Bruce Crandall or Snake S  h  i  t as he is called. Mark McCracken as Captain Ed Freeman or ""Too Tall"". So the story is simple as this in 1954 The French Army gets owned by The North Vietnameese Army. They show no mercy & slaughter them. So then you go to 1965 where you have US Army Colonel Hal Moore & his family that are going to live on base cause you live on base where ever yu are stationed. Then you are introduced to Major Basil Plumley & he does bring a little comic relief to the movie. You have some of these troops playing base ball & you're introduced to Major Bruce Crandall & he is aruging with his buddy Captain Ed Freeman if he is out or he is safe. Colonel Moore is behind him & he tells him "" I think you're out."" You go throught Colonel Moore trainning the troops & his stuff at home with his wife & kids there's a scene where his daughter asks what is a war. It is a good scene it is emotional where she asks will they take your life too. 1 of his men 2nd Lieutentant Geogheghan's wife had a baby & him & Colonel Moore become fast friends he talks to him about what it's like to a Soldier & Father. Mel Gibson does such a good job with the speech he gives to his men what's going on over here doesn't matter cause over there we are all American Soldiers. Then Moore finds out that The President isn't treating this like a real war. He is also in charge of The 7th Calvery the same unit that Genreal Custer was in charge of. He feels that not declaring a National Emergancy that he is being deprived of some of his best troops. So when you get to Nam Colonel Moore finds out that an American Base has been attacked & he is ordered to go into battle with 400 men into ""The Valley Of Death"" your get a really & I mean really bloody battle. Moore secures the weak areas before The NVA can. You go to the wives perspective where a lot of them start getting letters about their husband's death's. So Major Moore's wife becomes a bearer of bad news for a lot of them. You go to The NVA's perspective as well. At night Moore's forces catch enemy forces by suprise. The next day their still stuck at The LZ. Then you have a Journalist named Joe Galloway come into the picture during a lot of the brutality. Major Plumley hands him a rifle & tells him you ain't no journalist today. Moore & his troops are being overran by the enemy he tells his raidoman to call in a broken arrow meaning air reinforcements. The aircraft napalm the area a lot of NVA guys get BB Q'd but there attacking for every direction Moore's men get Nampalmed in a horrific scene. 1 soldier got burned really bad more than I can describe. I feel something for these guys cause I care about these characters. There's a part where base wants Moore to come back to Saigon for an evaluation Mel Gibson just sells it where he tells them no I will leave no man behind alive or dead they will all come home. You get to the final battle where it is all out & the troops are getting closer to the The NVA's underground tunnel. The NVA have strong set up & it feels like they are fighting for their lives the acting is that good. It looks like Moore is done for but then a helicopter comes in Major Crandall comes through & guns them a down helps them out. Colonel Moore stayed true to his speech that they will all come home. Despite what Mel Gibson has become lately he deserved some kind of award for this performance the scene where he is talking to Joe Galloway he has a breakdown alomost & says why didn't I die instead of my men. After almost a year Moore comes home to his wife & kids. LT Geoghengan's wife gets a letter by Moore's stating that her husband died in service. Then you have an older Hal Moore passing by The Wall as it's known & that's pretty much the movie. I'm sorry if I didn't explain the plot as good as I should've but war movies are harder for me to review. This is just an excellent movie Randall Wallace did a good job directing. Mel Gibson did a wonderful job. Sam Elliot was good, Chris Klein not the best actor he did a fine job in this flick. Barry Pepper did a really good job & Mark McCracken was ok. Everyone else did a very good job too.

Such amazing courage needs to be remembered, and such profound sacrifice should not be sugarcoated.I honestly cannot fathom why any viewer would give this film less than three stars. Perhaps some people are just so opposed to violence in general, or the Viet Nam war in particular, that they dislike any film portraying our military in an even a vaguely honorable light.

He again shows that when you want to make a film of epic proportions, he's the one you want in the leading role.

The battle scenes are intense and brutal to watch.  The naphalm scene is especially horrific though I assume very realistic.  Mel Gibson does a fine job as Col. Moore and Sam Elliot is superb as a tough seargent.  The scenes of families at home and the arrival of messages telling of the death of loved ones were well used to illustrate the wider impact of war.  In fact, it was the combination of war scenes and more personal scenes which put it over ""Saving Private Ryan"" (if only barely) in my mind.  Parents should be advised that this is not a film for children.  There is a considerable amount of violence and some pretty harsh language as well (I know that the cursing is realistic but I felt it personally detracted from both this and ""Saving Private Ryan"").  Anyway, I would recommend this film though I advise it is graphic.On a side note, the film only covers part of the battle in the Ia Drang Valley.

705819,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000068TPN,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[16, 18]","""We Were Soldiers Once...and Young: Ia Drang : The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam"" was written by Harold Moore and Joseph Galloway. A bestseller when first published it is the story of the first significant engagement between American troops and the Viet Cong, which took place between October 23 and November 26, 1965. Moore was the commander of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, and Galloway was the only reporter present throughout the 34 days of the battle. The Battle of Ia Drang in the central highlands of Vietnam is considered the first time and place where helicopter-based, air-mobile operations were used in combat. However the technological advancements of war become secondary to the story of over 400 U.S. soldiers surrounded by 2000 of the enemy. Heroism under relentless fire becomes the true story of the book and the main virtue of this 2002 film from director Randall Wallace (""The Man in the Iron Mask"").""We Were Soldiers"" assumes that the audience does not know about the book on which the film is based; it toys with the audience several times with setting up Moore (Mel Gibson) to be killed. Moore knows history and cannot help but wondering if he is also leading the 7th calvary into a massacre just like Custer in 1876; however, Sgt. Major Basil Plumley (Sam Elliott) pointedly reminds Moore of that fact the colonel ain't Custer. The backbone of the story is Moore's promise to his men that he would be the first one on and the last one off the battlefield and not even orders from his superiors, who do not want to have an American lieutenant colonel killed during a massacre, are going to get him to break his word. But ultimately the entire purpose of this film is to provide a realistic portrait of ground combat during Vietnam and drive home the fact that these soldiers were not fighting and dying for their country but for each other. This particular firefight lasts three days and nights, 56 straight hours of nonstop battle, and time and time again you become convinced that none of these soldiers are going to get out of there alive.The battle is juxtaposed with scenes of Moore's wife, Julie (Madeline Stowe), who is forced to deliver the telegrams announcing the death of their husbands to their widows because the Army was using taxi cabs drivers. Like a similar scene in ""A League of Their Own,"" such scenes violate our scene of propriety, ingrained in countless other war movies from ""The Fighting Sullivans"" to ""Saving Private Ryan,"" that the military has a moral imperative in sending officers out to deliver such shattering news in person. However, we end up getting the idea that these telegrams were being sent while the bodies of these men were still lying in body bags on the battlefield.Hal Moore, who retired as a Lt. General, gave ""We Were Soldiers"" his stamp of approval as the first Hollywood film to get what fighting was like in Vietnam, which is good enough for me. Watching this film while American troops are again fighting and dying in a war on the other side of the globe makes it even more potent. The performances are uniformly good, with Barry Pepper as the reporter Galloway, who distinguishes himself both with his camera and an automatic rifle during the battle, Greg Kinnear as head chopper pilot Major Bruce Crandall, and Keri Russell as Barbara Geoghegan, the wife of a young 2nd Lt. who sees her husband go off to war right after she had given birth to their first child. My only major complaint about this film is that the score by Nick Glennie-Smith often overwhelms the scenes of battle with music that provides a discordant apotheosis. I can totally appreciate the idea of not providing heroic music, but what we have here goes too far in sanctifying the action. The blood and the guts being displayed by heroic actions and brutal deaths on screen do that without needing the music; just watch the ""Broken Arrow"" chapter for proof.Before the final credits the film shows the names of the soldiers who died at L-Z X-Ray ; even more poignant is the fact that there names are inscribed on Panel 3 East of the Vietnam War Memorial, because there were so many panels that follow (70 in all inscribed with 58,000 names). Ultimately, ""We Were Soldiers"" avoids taking a political stance on the war beyond what is brought to the experience by the audience (the most political scene with Moore debriefed by McNamra & Westmoreland is one of those deleted). Moore's battlefield counterpart, Lt. Col. Nguyen Huu An (Don Duong) is presented as a dedicated, competent leader (the scenes in his underground command post also provide us our clearest understanding of what is actually happening on the battlefield). When Moore looks at the diary of a Vietcong soldier who almost killed him, he finds a picture of a woman, who to my eye anyway looks like Moore's own wife. The symmetry makes it perfectly clear that the troops on the other side were soldiers too.",5,Bringing home the reality of ground combat in Vietnam,1050019200,"04 11, 2003",2003,4924,"['Were',

705820,A2NDWCVX2ZT8QV,B000068TPN,Lawrence Bird,"[18, 20]","After all those terrible years of ""Deer Hunterish"" drivel and ""Apocalyptic"" nonsense, Hollywood has finally, if (probably) temporarily, acceded to that fact that there is nothing glorious in the lot of the soldier other than the fraternity and special respect of a fellow soldier.  With almost no nod to the steaming domestic politics of the 1960s other than those that directly affect the soldiers and their families (or any contemporary politics either - how refreshing), ""We Were Soldiers"" does a pretty fair and honest job of exposing both the rubies and the warts of a combat soldier's life.  Thankfully, most of the gratuitous machoisms that the entertainment industry finds so entertaining in war flicks are absent.The 1st Cav (the unit that is the subject of ""We Were Soldiers"") was the cutting edge of air-mobility for most of the Vietnam conflict - and, having served with the Gerry Owen bunch, they never seemed to loose their special can-do spirit.  Much of what was learned about combat assaults, extractions, coordination of multiple levels of tac-air, aerial rocket artillery, hunter-killer teams and highly mobile ground based artillery, was pioneered in real-time by the Cav and quickly shared with the Infantry divisions who deployed to SE Asia in the next year or two.  ""We Were Solders"" does a pretty good job of outlining the metamorphosis of 11th Air Assault at Fort Benning, Georgia into the 1st Cav, and it's subsequent deployment into Vietnam as America ramped up its ground efforts beyond the badly stretched Green Berets, and other military advisors.  (BTW:  The area, Kelly Hill, at Ft. Benning where the real 11th Air Assault was formed, was also the same area where much of John Wayne's ""Green Beret"" was filmed).Special kudos also to ""We Were Soldiers"" for doing a pretty fair job of showing the sometimes harsh realities of the life of the military family (the rather sterile ""Top Gun"" is the only other recent film I can think of that has taken the time to try to explore the often forgotten heroes back home...).  The military family, regardless of the rank of the soldier, seldom enjoys the predictable, geographically stable character of their civilian counter-parts.

It is offers a more accurate portrayal of combat in the Vietnam War as compared to the more metaphorical movies such as APOCALYPSE NOW, FULL METAL JACKET or PLATOON.  WE WERE SOLDIERS concentrates on heroism and sacrifice in Vietnam as opposed to the other aspects (anti-war/demoralized troops, civilian massacres, drugs, corruption,etc.) that are explored in the other Vietnam movies.Randall Wallace (BRAVEHEART) is the writer/director. Mel Gibson stars as Moore with co-stars Sam Elliott (ROUGH RIDERS), Greg Kinnear (AS GOOD AS IT GETS), Madeleine Stowe (12 MONKEYS), Barry Pepper (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN), Keri Russell (THE AMERICANS), Jon Hamm (MAD MEN) and Clark Gregg (IRON MAN). The ill-fated French bugler in the opening scene is Randall Wallace's son.WE WERE SOLDIERS lacks the stunning and artistic drama of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but it still delivers a very good portrayal of heroism and sacrifice in a very controversial war.One highlight of the movie that, unfortunately, is only in the deleted scenes is Moore's post-battle meeting with Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and Gen. William Westmoreland. This scene should have been kept in the movie because it sums up the Johnson Administration's (particularly McNamara) misguided philosophy in Vietnam.WE WERE SOLDIERS is highly recommended as one of the best, if not the best, Vietnam War movies.",4,very good movie about the Vietnam War,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,1503,"['movie', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'Battle', 'Ia', 'Drang', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Hal', 'Moore', 'Joe', 'Galloway', 'more', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'combat', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'compared', 'more', 'metaphorical', 'movies', 'such', 'APOCALYPSE', 'NOW', 'FULL', 'METAL', 'JACKET', 'PLATOON', 'WE', 'WERE', 'SOLDIERS', 'heroism', 'sacrifice', 'Vietnam', 'opposed', 'other', 'aspects', 'anti-war/demoralized', 'troops', 'civilian', 'massacres', 'drugs', 'corruption', 'etc', 'are', 'explored', 'other', 'Vietnam', 'movies.Randall', 'Wallace', 'BRAVEHEART', 'writer/director', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Moore', 'co-stars', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'ROUGH', 'RIDERS', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'AS', 'GOOD', 'IT', 'GETS', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', '12', 'MONKEYS', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'THE', 'AMERICANS', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'MAD', 'MEN', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'ill-fated', 'French', 'bugler', 'opening', 'scene', 'Randall', 'Wallace', 'son.WE', 'WERE', 'SOLDIERS', 'stunning', 'artistic', 'drama', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'portrayal', 'heroism', 'sacrifice', 'very', 'controversial', 'war.One', 'highlight', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Moore', 'post-battle', 'meeting', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'Robert', 'McNamara', 'Gen.', 'William', 'Westmoreland', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'kept', 'movie', 'Johnson', 'Administration', 'particularly', 'McNamara', 'misguided', 'philosophy', 'Vietnam.WE', 'WERE', 'SOLDIERS', 'highly', 'recommended', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'best', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'movies']",N/A

705827,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000068TPN,Linda Linguvic,"[8, 10]","Based on the book by Lt. Col. Harold Moore and Joseph Galloway, this film is about a 1964 battle of less than 400 U.S. soldiers against more than 2,000 North Vietnamese, which set the stage for the slaughters that were to follow. There's plenty of graphic violence using the most modern cinematographic effects and we are again reminded of the horror of war and the tragic human toll it takes.Mel Gibson does a fine job as man who must lead his troops into battle.  Some of the scenes on the home front though are a bit too maudlin for my taste, as he plays a religious father of five, who must do his duty by protecting his loved ones at home. The army wives are just a little too sweet and brainless although a later scene in which Madeline Stowe, cast as Moore's wife, does show her to be a fine actress.  There is too much talk in the early scenes, too much of a sugar coated version of ""life in the 60s"".But then the men go to Vietnam, and this is where the real story begins.  It is a story of heroism in spite of unbelievable odds.  It is the story of death and pain and wounds so graphic that I wanted to cover my eyes.  It is the story of the very beginnings of a war that later turned into a muddled mess.  The film made a small attempt to show some of the humanity of a North Vietnamese soldier but I suspect however that this was inserted merely for political correctness.  This story is indeed an American story that managed somehow to hate the war and yet honor the men who fought in it.The action was intense, and with the exception of some of the early scenes, the story moved along well.  Mel Gibson and his supporting cast of actors did their jobs well.  I was moved and upset once again by the futility of war and thankful for the comfortable life I take so for granted.  We've all seen films like this before though and know the outcome.  It's not for everyone but I recommend it for war film buffs.

A nation turned against them, their Commander-in-Chief deceived them, and the only honor they had was the courage they faced on the battlefield.  The stunning performances only enhance the incredible storyline by giving the viewer a real sense of what the Vietnam War was really all about.  While many Americans turned their backs on the veterans of this horrific war, there is a story - about real people with real lives, and real emotions that needed to be told.  It's long overdue, and highly regarded.  This movie tells a story.  It reminds us that there is more to a great war movie than just killing, guts, and blood.  Definitely Oscar worthy!!  It deserves Best Picture and Best Actor for Mel Gibson!!  You'll have to see it twice just to experience and understand it all.",5,Astonishing!  Riveting!  Compelling!

The fight was also the first test of our Army's brand new ""air mobile"" tactical doctrine, which would become a signature of U.S. troop deployment in Vietnam. Lt. Colonel Hal Moore and 450 men of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment (George Custer's old outfit), were inserted by helicopter into the Ia Drang Valley, where Army Intelligence suspected that North Vietnamese Army (NVA) units were headquartered. What Moore and his men didn't know, but were about to find out, was that several NVA divisions - numbering thousands of troops - were waiting for them in the Chu Pong Massif overlooking the Ia Drang. After three days of constant, fierce fighting and severe attrition to both sides, the North Vietnamese broke off the engagement and left the field to the Americans.The movie follows Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), as he prepares his green troops for Vietnam, then chronicles their bloody struggle at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Ia Drang. It also highlights the effect of the struggle on the families left behind, including Moore's wife Julie (Madeleine Stowe) and children.The Good: We Were Soldiers benefits from the talents of such likeable stars as Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, Barry Pepper, and of course Mel Gibson. It also devotes some time to the North Vietnamese view of the battle, which is unique and welcome.The Bad: An instructive comparison can be drawn between We Were Soldiers and Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down. Both are based on true stories of Americans who faced battles against long odds and prevailed through skill and courage. Whereas Black Hawk Down hews very close to its unflinchingly objective source material, though, We Were Soldiers pulls out all the stops to manipulate our feelings. Randall Wallace, who shanked one last year with Pearl Harbor, errs even more grievously this time with a cheesy script and heavy-handed direction. His players are good, but they can't save this one. Shame on Wallace for failing to do justice to Hal Moore and Joe Galloway's moving yet unsentimental account of the battle.The Bottom Line: The Vietnam War has produced a remarkable crop of great films.

705843,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B000068TPN,Martin Asiner,"[0, 0]","WE WERE SOLDIERS is one of the most significant war movies of this or any other era. Director Randall Wallace tells the tale of the Seventh Cavalry (Custer's Cavalry) as it fought a numerically superior North Vietnamese Army in a battle that meant nothing in a tactical sense in the Vietnam of 1964.  There are two perspectives.  One is from an American colonel played by Mel Gibson while the other is from his adversary, a Vietcong colonel played straight by Don Duong, without the bucktoothed screechiness of a former generation's Asian army commander. Despite the different uniforms and political philosophies of both Duong and Gibson, they are more alike than each would probably care to admit.  Both are dedicated and experienced leaders of men and neither is willing to allow personal feelings to get in the way of the killing business that is war.WE WERE SOLDIERS is seemingly no more than the tale of a regiment of soldiers that covers first their training for battle, then later the battle itself.  But as in many war movies, the complexity of the war is only slowly brought into focus.  Director Wallace, in addition to showing the Vietnamese side through many vignettes that parallel the strategy sessions of the Americans also shows the wives and families of the soldiers.  Madeline Stowe is particularly effective as Gibson's wife who knows only all too well that the fortunes of war are sometimes reduced to the cliche of insensate luck as the determining factor in who comes home in one piece and who does not.  It is she who takes on the onerous burden of delivering the telegrams of death to the wives of her husband's soldiers.  The large cast includes a sterling performance by Sam Elliot, as an experienced sergeant-major who helps his men retain both life and sanity in the insanity of hand to hand combat.What emerges as a subtext is the unsettling notion that in combat the enemy often differs more from us by the color of uniform worn than by anything else.  The extremely realistic scenes of bodies being ripped to pieces make the viewer care that some soldiers are being killed by some other soldiers, while not particularly caring about the colors of their uniforms.  The 'We' of WE WERE SOLDIERS is a sobering reminder that we should be glad that killing is so horrible, else we might grow overly fond of it.",5,There Were Many 'We's' in WE WERE SOLDIERS,1044057600,"02 1, 2003",2003,2336,"['WE', 'WERE', 'SOLDIERS', 'one', 'most', 'significant', 'war', 'movies', 'other', 'era', 'Director', 'Randall', 'Wallace', 'tale', 'Seventh', 'Cavalry', 'Custer', 'Cavalry', 'fought', 'numerically', 'superior', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'Army', 'battle', 'meant', 'nothing', 'tactical', 'sense', 'Vietnam', '1964', 'are', 'two', 'perspectives', 'One', 'American', 'colonel', 'played', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'other', 'adversary', 'Vietcong', 'colonel', 'played', 'straight', 'Don', 'Duong', 'bucktoothed', 'screechiness', 'former', 'generation', 'Asian', 'army', 'commander', 'different', 'uniforms', 'political', 'philosophies', 'Duong', 'Gibson', 'are', 'more', 'alike', 'would', 'probably', 'care', 'admit', 'are', 'dedicated', 'experienced', 'leaders', 'men', 'willing', 'allow', 'personal', 'feelings', 'get', 'way', 'killing', 'business', 'war.WE', 'WERE', 'SOLDIERS', 'seemingly', 'no', 'more', 'tale', 'regiment', 'soldiers', 'covers', 'first', 'training', 'battle', 'then', 'later', 'battle', 'many', 'war', 'movies', 'complexity', 'war', 'only', 'slowly', 'brought', 'focus', 'Director', 'Wallace', 'addition', 'showing', 'Vietnamese', 'side', 'many', 'vignettes', 'parallel', 'strategy', 'sessions', 'Americans', 'also', 'wives', 'families', 'soldiers', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', 'particularly', 'effective', 'Gibson', 'wife', 'who', 'only', 'too', 'well', 'fortunes', 'war', 'are', 'sometimes', 'reduced', 'cliche', 'insensate', 'luck', 'determining', 'factor', 'who', 'home', 'one', 'piece', 'who', 'not', 'who', 'onerous', 'burden', 'delivering', 'telegrams', 'death', 'wives', 'husband', 'soldiers', 'large', 'cast', 'sterling', 'performance', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'experienced', 'sergeant-major', 'who', 'men', 'retain', 'life', 'sanity', 'insanity', 'hand', 'hand', 'combat.What', 'subtext', 'unsettling', 'notion', 'combat', 'enemy', 'often', 'more', 'color', 'uniform', 'worn', 'anything', 'else', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'scenes', 'bodies', 'being', 'ripped', 'pieces', 'make', 'viewer', 'care', 'soldiers', 'are', 'being', 'killed', 'other', 'soldiers', 'not', 'particularly', 'caring', 'colors', 'uniforms', ""'We"", 'WE', 'WERE', 'SOLDIERS', 'sobering', 'reminder', 'should', 'be', 'glad', 'killing', 'so', 'horrible', 'else', 'might', 'grow', 'overly', 'fond']",N/A

705845,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B000068TPN,maskedgamer,"[0, 0]","I've seen ""We Were Soldiers"" quite a few times and actually watched it again yesterday. At the time this movie came out 9/11 was still fresh in the minds of the American people an a lot of these ""American Hero"" war movies started flooding the theaters. I like we were soldiers as a war flick but it also suffers from lacking realism. It's somehow a portrayal of realistic events with a non realistic story line. It's obvious certain things were ""Hollywoodized"" in the film to give the movie a sense of glamor but it made the movie feel cheap in certain places where it wasn't needed.The movie starts out following Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Hal Moore who undertakes the responsibility of bringing troops to the first battle US Army battle in the Vietnam war. Before any of the soldiers arrive you get to see how they live before hand. They all live picture perfect lives in on base Military neighborhoods. They are all family men and dedicated to their wives,children and their country. I honestly could not stand this part about the movie. It's too whitebread and an unrealistic portrayal of actual soldiers, even in that era. Army bases are made up of people from all walks of life and they all have their reasons for joining. It's a very diverse place but there is a strong bond of comradely because everyone is there to serve the same purpose. You never get to see that part of military life because you're only shown their personal lives from the point of the ""Army wives"" really. It makes the impact of really understanding the battle hard because your not connected to the personal stories of the soldiers. Their backgrounds are either never introduced so there's no real reason to feel for them if they are killed or their background has been hollywoodized into the ""Great American Hero"" story. In a film that's supposed to bring impact about what these soldiers went through it's hard to connect with them without knowing who they are so you can relate to them and that's very important to establish in any war movie. Instead of seeing a group of soldiers that have come to know and bond with their platoon so they have each others backs during war, you just see soldiers and faces you hardly know. It makes certain scenes seemed forced or out of place when someone risks their lives to save someone like their best friends but you never even heard the soldiers name before. Something always put me off about this movie and that was pretty much it. It's a Vietnam movie based half about the lives of the soldiers, and then the war and their sacrifice. But, the first have maybe only the lives of 2 soldiers are ever presented. What about the others that don't live in houses and have a wife and kids? (Of course their story is told at the end of the movie, the people that come home to no one there to greet them"").I do think the movie despite that issue does give a good emotional insight to how the army wives felt finding out that their husbands had been killed at war. Although I found Lt. Col Hal's wife and her friends good deeds to be mostly out of their own selfishness more than anything.  The battle portions of the movie of course try to add shock value and throw drama on you as much as it possibly can. However, it suffers from the ""Invincible Hard-ss"" syndrome. Where top ranking men can walk through bullet fire and not even have to worry about ""carrying rifle"" or ""ducking"" to avoid fire. It's almost as if through the movie Mel Gibson's character has somehow figured a way to have bullets bounce off of him, as he doesn't seem to feel a need to duck,dodge, or try to avoid anyone's fire at all. Although his role is acted well, it takes away from that realistic aspect that the movie is trying to bring where in one movie soldiers are dying left and right and then in the next scene bullets just seem to bounce right off of one man. I don't care if you're Chuck Norris himself, if someone is firing a 50 caliber machine gun at you, YOU ARE going to duck for cover.The other problem with the combat is that the movie makes it seem like the Vietnamese army just popped out the ground and started charging at people Civil war style. The Vietnamese were not that sloppy and knew how to make good use of Guerrilla warfare. Their ability to sneak up on their enemy and overwhelm them was their greatest strength. The movie doesn't go into much detail at all about that but just shows swarms of Vietnamese running out the ground like ants and into American rifles. Some points of the movie show their war tactics well like when Mel Gibson's character tells his men to fire 3 shots at anything they thing is strange and then they squad fires and all of a sudden out of know where you see all these Vietnamese troops rising out the ground. That was very good scene.Overall the movie is about a 3/5 when it comes to a war movie. I just never could adopt to the idea of a ""Realistic"" war movie that's been ""hollywoodized"". ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" are also films that suffered from that effect.What I loved the most about this film were the choppers. The Hueys really steal the show and this is the first movie I've ever seen that showed the true importance of their support in the war. They are literally the lifeline for these soldiers. I always loved the Huey and every scene they have in the movie is like heaven to watch. The scenes with them are amazing, especially the scene where Snake flies in and delivers his personal thoughts to the Vietnamese via, his machine guns. There's just something about the Huey that's amazing. There is one thing I wanted to note about the film, and that's that no one ever has a reaction to the wind from the propeller force of the Huey. If you've ever been on a huey or right up on a huey when it's taking off than you don't know. It's almost like a tornado it blows wind and kicks up anything around it pretty hard. I found some scenes funny when the helicopter would land and Mel Gibson would just be standing without so much as his jacket even waving in the wind.",4,A good movie about war but not a realistic

We've had the Viet Vet home from the war story in ""The Deer Hunter,"" the LSD drenched, hallucination of ""Apocalypse Now,"" as well as ""Platoon,"" ""Full Metal Jacket,"" and the recent ""Tigerland"" to name several.  Even Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" is partly, a thought provoking treatise not only on JFK's assasination but on Lyndon Johnson's motives in regards to the US's initial involvement in Vietnam. ""Soldiers"" is not concerned with the whys at all but with the hows and the wherefores.""We Were Soldiers"" is fascinating on several fronts: first of all it takes place in 1965 after the defeat of the French in ""Indo-China,"" while all the other films dealing with the Vietnam conflict are ""en medias res"" or in the 1970's. Secondly the Mel Gibson character, Hal Moore is not only a Colonel...but a Harvard scholar and war tactician.  Upon receiving his orders to Vietnam, he researches the French's massacre there as well as that of George Custer at Little Bighorn.  In fact Moore's Regiment is assigned the number 7...the same as Custer's.We, along with Moore, are thus filled with a deep feeling of dread and forboding much like that engendered by Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) as he makes his way towards Col. Kurtz's lair in ""Apocalypse Now.""Much has been made concerning the battle scenes; and yes they are as graphic as anything in ""Saving Private Ryan"" but the director, Randall Wallace and producer, Mel Gibson should be congratulated for not pulling back from the horror and carnage especially since at several points it seems that Moore's regiment might indeed fall victim to the same fate as Custer's. This film is the exact opposite of the recent ""Black Hawk Down"" in that the war in ""WWS"" is fought on the foot soldier level with Moore right on the scene giving orders and strategizing.The "" Back Home"" scenes are handled well: barely missing going overboard into the corny and maudlin.

Director Randall Wallace spares little in his brutal fight scenes; the horror of war is captured and viewed from both sides.

If you watch the actresses closely, you'll sense an underlying nervousness and fear.  The cast is wonderful: Mel Gibson brings his John Wayneish charisma to a role that demands only fierce drive, loyalty and compassion; Madeline Stowe displays her courage and her fear in a role that could have been merely fodder; Sam Elliott's one-toned delivery masks what he feels inside; Chris Klein's turn as the new father destined for disaster is sensitively portrayed; Barry Pepper is remarkable in his role as the journalist on whose book this movie is based; Ryan Hurst as Savage is likewise touching and commendable.

Although some scenes seemed a bit forced and obvious, overall I thought the film was very moving. It has intense combat scenes, intimate human drama, and welcome touches of humor. The aforementioned actors are all excellent in their roles, but my favorite performance is given by Sam Elliott as a no-nonsense, battle-tested sergeant major. Elliott and Gibson have solid onscreen chemistry together.The DVD version of the film includes deleted scenes that further flesh out the characters. There is also a superb ""making of"" documentary which gives many insights into the film's production.

705864,A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,B000068TPN,"Mike London ""MAC""","[2, 9]","We Were Soldiers, a true story, deals with the first contact between the North Vietnamese Army and U. S. soldiers.  The U. S. quickly discover they have underestimated the Vietnamese forces and find themselves vastly outnumbered.  Men are cut off from one another, and under the leadership of Mel Gibson's character they must withstand the modern equivalent of Custer's Last Stand.Part of the grand tradition of Vietnam war movies is edgy, paranoid atmosphere. When watching Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, you get the edgy, I'm-going-to-snap-soon feeling.  Another almost necessary feature of Vietnam movies is questioning the war itself.  One of the most poignant and powerful moments in Full Metal Jacket is the very last scene where the soldiers are marching in the dusk singing the theme song to the Mickey Mouse Club.  You can really get into the psyche of that generation and the rage and protest it felt against the war.We Were Soldiers, on the other hand. does not examine the war or capture that generation's rage against it.  Instead, We Were Soldiers sadly plays like more of a conventional war film.The movie starts with Gibson training his boys and being a family man.  There is one moment where the men are standing in the woods during training, listening to a radio transmission filled with gunfire.  Gibson comments on the importance of training and that on the battlefield there are no second chances.  The men look appropriately somber.  Then the film moves to Vietnam itself.The strong points of the film are the battle scenes.  While not wholly accurate (the Vietnamese did not pile up their dead bodies), the battles are realistic, sometimes terribly realistic.  One young soldier gets burnt and his flesh melts.  The rest of the film alternates between the battle and the wives at home getting letters saying their husbands have been killed and how the wives unite together to support those lost.  A reporter comes to the battle and later tells the soldiers' story.Overall, the film is rather a disappointment.  While I was fairly certain it wouldn't come anywhere near Apocalypse Now, against which all other Vietnam films should be gauged, I was hoping it would capture the uncertainty and constant questioning of why we were in Nam in the first place.While it is a true story, the  writers could have better captured that generation's attitude toward the war while keeping true to the facts.  Since it details the first encounter, they could have dealt with the soldiers realizing that maybe Vietnam isn't where they're supposed to be at, or get a more accurate shot of trying to figure out just why they're here.In the end, We Were Soldiers becomes this rather dazzling paradox.  While it remains true to the facts of the story itself, it does not stay true to the political climate of the 1960s, creating this rather bizarre hybrid of accurate journalism as far as the microcosmic level is concerned (the details of the battle itself), but is just flat-out wrong on the macrocosmic level goes (the counterculture's reaction against Vietnam)In the end, the more patriotism-oriented themes of We Were Soldiers is far better suited to a film dealing with WW II, not Vietnam.-Written as Newspaper review in 2002 (released on Amazon.co.uk in 2007) and for whatever reason I never released this on the main Amazon site",2,"""This film IS VIET NAM"".

705867,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B000068TPN,Mitch Weaver,"[7, 7]","&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; manages to show the brotherhood between soldiers, the horror of war, and the commaraderie between the soldier's wives. The film is set in 1965, when America was at war with Vietnam. The commander of the air calvary is Lt. Col. Hal Moore ( Mel Gibson). Moore is a natural born leader and treats all of his soldiers like they were his own family. He is assigned to take his troops into hostile territory, to gain the upper hand. However, things do not go as planned, and the casualties start to mount. Back at home, Moore's wife Julia (Madeline Stowe) takes on the responsibility of keeping morale high for the soldiers' wives and handing out the death letters that are sent. The film is shot brilliantly and takes us back and forth between the two, to let us truly experience what happened.&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; is one of the best war films that I have seen in quite some time. The film is based on Lt. Col. Hal Moore's book &quot;We Were Soldiers Once.. and Young&quot;. This provides for an amazingly accurate portrayal of the events that took place. The battle sequences are among the best that I have ever seen, and the camera work used was phenomenal(especially in the air). The musical score used was beautiful and one of the best that I have ever heard. But perhaps the best aspect of this film, was that it showed that there was more than one side to the war. Most war films only show American soldiers fighting and trying to win the war. This was the first war film, that took an in depth look at the Colonel of the Vietnamese army, and how he strategized. That was my favorite aspect of the film, because it put Colonel against Colonel. But it did not just show each sides strategies. The film also shows what both sides went through as well. We see that Vietnam was a country fighting to defend itself just like us, and like us, they also suffered. This gives the film a more well rounded feel to it.&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; offers tons of star power as well. Mel Gibson shows once again why he is one of the best actors alive today. His portrayal of Lt. Col. Hal Moore is sensational. He gives an extremely accurate portrayal of the man, with his overall intelligence, his courage under fire, and his unending loyalty towards his troops. &quot;I will leave no man behind...dead or alive. We will all come home together.&quot; Definately one of Gibson's best roles since Braveheart. Madeline Stowe is outstanding as Moore's wife Julie. The way that she keeps morale high with the soldier's wives is amazing. Very convincing role. Sam Elliot is very good as Sergeant Major Basil Plumley. Plumley is Gibson's right hand man, and never leaves his side. He is also very tough, and corageous under fire. Other fine performances were given by Greg Kinnear, Chris Kline, Keri Russel, and Barry Pepper.Overall, this is one of the best all around war films that I have ever seen. The film is extremely realistic, takes an in depth look at both sides of the war, and has outstanding acting all the way around. The DVD is outstanding. It offers extremely nice picture and sound quality, that only makes watching the film even better. The extras are incredible.

In the first scene, a viewer could find themselves a bit overwhelmed by the realism of the combat, as well as the blood in some places.Once through the first scene, what follows is a movie that takes you on an emotional rollercoaster ride through the lives and loves of the men of the 1st Air Cav. They were the first unit to engage the North Vietnamese forces in a major battle and along with being outnumbered, they were also testing a fledgling style of battle using helicopters.The movie inserts you into the lives of the men and also their families and wives. You will find yourself fully immersed into their loves, joys, pains and problems. The story fully engages you with the emotions of losing husbands overseas, losing friends, and losing men. It is a powerful movie and a powerful story. if you watch it in groups, keep a supply of tissues nearby.In terms of the battle scenes, they are violent and realistic, however they fit well into the context and they show something of what it must have been like to be in the middle of an intense battle. This is not surprising, as Hal Moore, (played by Gibson in the movie), consulted on this movie.All in all, this is among the best war movies I have seen, both for the powerful story it tells and the sheer level of action that it shows.

There is not much I can add that hasn't already been said about the story itself.  I would just say that the great strength of this film lies in its focus on the soldiers as real people, with real lives, real families, real personalities, etc.  Gibson did an excellent job of emphasizing the emotional and psychological trauma of war, both for those in the battle and those waiting at home for news.This production was gritty, realistic and hard-hitting, similar to the Private Ryan/Band of Brothers standard for graphic portrayal of war violence.  Actors like Gibson, Kinnear, and Moore gave extemely believable performances, with Harris Pepper's character only marginally less convincing.  Finally, I enjoyed the absence of political commentary or moralizing about the war overall.

705878,A29ZTW8IH9S5WR,B000068TPN,Noonie Fortin,"[7, 12]","Knowing some of the people involved with this true story and having met General Harold Moore and Joe Galloway a few years ago I felt a necessity to see the film as soon as possible (ASAP). I had read their co-authored book We Were Soldiers Once and Young so I already knew what to expect of the film. I knew that neither he nor Joe wanted just any Hollywood company to turn their book into a fiasco. They wanted the truth told and shown so Americans could learn about one particular unit and the major battle they fought in 1965.I knew that Mel Gibson was at Fort Benning, Georgia (GA) preparing to make the film. I also knew that they moved the film crew out to Fort Hunter-Liggett in California for the actual battle scenes. I was aware that the producer, director, screenplay writer and company involved with making the movie had also done &quot;Braveheart&quot; which won five Academy Awards a few years ago. I felt they would stick to reality rather than sugar coating the true story. While some things were changed to make the movie from the book most of it was as real as possible.The movie began by showing French soldiers being massacred in June 1954 in the IaDrang Valley by the North Vietnamese. This valley became known as the Valley of Death and was often compared to GEN Custer's battle at the Little Big Horn. This was the first intense battle scene of the film but it was far from being the last.Although this film was about the IaDrang Valley battle of November 1965 it also showed the public much more. It gave you the opportunity to meet certain characters up close and personal. It shows the wives, families, how they were affected and how these women helped each other during this time in history as well as their spouses and children.On Sunday 14 November 1965 the 1/7, made up of about 400 US soldiers, arrived at Landing Zone (LZ) Xray and soon found themselves up against more than 2000 North Vietnamese Army (NVA) soldiers. For the next three days the soldiers battled the enemy. Precise times and locations were scrolled across the bottom of the screen. This entire part of the film is very intense. There were firefights, hand-to-hand combat, and bombing missions, which were so close to our own men that there were friendly fire casualties.As darkness engulfed the battalion things got worse. LTC Moore walked among his soldiers reassuring them and telling them they did well to that point and to continue. Casualties were mounting. Moore was seen several times praying over the dead and wounded members of his battalion. This showed his compassion even more for his men.As word was spreading back home of casualties the wives soon found out that the Army was not prepared for this. Taxicab drivers were delivering those dreaded telegrams. For whatever reason it showed that there were no chaplains or counselors there to handle this process. I don't recall that ever really happening so I'm hoping that was just a little bit of the Hollywood effect put on the film. Whatever the case was, in this movie Julie Moore took it upon herself to deliver all the messages to the spouses of her husband's soldiers.Meanwhile Joe Galloway knew that there was heavy fighting going on and he jumped onboard a chopper to go see for himself. Armed only with several cameras he goes into the heat of the battle. When asked why he was there Galloway said to help the people home understand the war by shooting pictures not a rifle. More air strikes are called in and one of the men Joe came to know briefly was badly burned. He carried him to a waiting chopper. This was a rather gruesome scene.The second and third days of battle weren't any better. The NVA kept bringing in fresh troops as our soldiers were trying to continue the battle themselves. LTC Moore asked for a head count of his men and when he found two were missing he went out himself looking for them.As Joe Galloway continued shooting pictures Moore said &quot;I'll never forgive myself that my men died and I didn't.&quot; Joe commented, &quot;I don't know how to tell this story.&quot; And Moore's response was &quot;You got to Joe. Tell them how my troopers died.&quot;LTC Moore refused to leave the IaDrang till all his men living or dead were taken off the field of battle. He kept his promise although 234 of his troopers died. LTC Moore wrote personal letters to each deceased soldier's family. His compassion continued throughout the next 235 days his battalion was in Vietnam and to this day.Before the credits rolled there was a brief narration about how our soldiers returned home with no bands, flags, or welcomes. The soldiers knew they fought for each other. The final scene was one of two soldiers, one in a wheelchair, going down what appeared to be an airport hallway. A woman with her children approached them and she pulled the children away from the soldiers as if they were diseased or something.The names of the fallen soldiers of the 1/7 are listed on Panel 3 East of The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. Moore and Galloway told their story well. Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson portrayed it excellently.Though graphic in nature this is a MUST SEE movie. Be prepared for a roller coaster of emotions. I believe the film has shown what the IaDrang Valley battle was really like. Those people who may be squeamish about blood, burns, broken burns, etc might want to stay home. BUT if you are a true fan and prefer seeing war movies-this is the one to go to! You not only see the battle scenes but also learn some of the relationship between the men, their wives, and families.",5,A MUST SEE MOVIE!,1075334400,"01 29, 2004",2004,5576,"['Knowing', 'people',

Later, when they die, you don't care.The battle sequences are very realistic and gory, but so confusingly shot that it all flattens out. Yes war is chaos, but editing shouldn't be. The director is in way over his head. If a soldier gets a line of dialogue, he is pretty much dead within a couple of beats. It's so predictable.The writer needed a director, and the director needed a writer. Unfortunately, they were both the same guy, Randall Wallace, the guy who wrote Braveheart. Should have known his limitations. The script is brutal. With such good source material, how is that possible?Gibson is decent as the naif colonel, the victim of a totally unedited script (notwithstanding an American accent that wanders constantly).Two more points that are the responsibility of the producers and director collectively.The story is set in the central highlands of Vietnam, not the jungles we are used to from many other Vietnam films. The problem, as historically accurate as this may be, the location looks like Griffith park. It's impossible to imagine the soldiers in peril in this setting. Nobody noticed this (or perhaps the stones to mention it) but it really hurts the film.The film focuses on over-selling the courage of the soldiers, which no one is contesting. Cutting back and forth to the VietCong point of view is one of the more successful devices. But the tragedy, which is where the story is, is in the soldiers being sent into indefensible terrain, and surrounded, then, after hundreds of deaths, they realize ""Oh! We can bomb the crap out of the surrounding mountains and kill all the Charlies that way!""The whole battle was conducted backwards, and the interesting story is of the idiots back in Saigon or wherever who planned the mission, or once they realized they were up against a much larger enemy force than they anticipated, no one made any tactical adjustments.The behavior of some of the soldiers is just so dumb. Yeah it was the beginning of Vietnam and we had much to learn, but trust me, anyone whose seen three cowboy and indian movies knows you don't take your whole platoon running after one guy, shouting all the while ""get him!"" ""get him!"" My kid knew it was a trap.I liked Braveheart, overwrought as it was, but this is a mess. Wallace needed to quit while he was ahead.

For this offering, he rejoined with Randall Wallace, who penned ""Braveheart"".  This time, Randall Wallace took the helm, & perhaps, he's been given more flexibility by Mel's film company, Icon Production, & therefore, ""We Were Soldiers"" was able to shine whereas ""Pearl Harbour"" wouldn't match.  One of Randall's forte was to give us a glimpse of humanity at work in the war that United States shouldn't be involved at the first place.  For the first time, Vietnamese was shown a matching fighter against US' military might.  We were also brought into the realm of the armies' families witnessing first-hand the wives' initial denial but eventual acceptance of the demise of their husbands (& fathers of their children).  Their greivance were heart-felt & for the first time, we were shown perspective of both Americans & Vietnamese.  I sincerely believe that this movie covered a lot of ground such as bringing to our attention that in a war, it's irrelevant what races they are.  The soldiers are brothers in arms, & they are fighting the war as Americans & therefore, in time of dire needs, it's their duty to look after one another.  The movie questioned the need of fighting someone else's war, & brought to surface the treatment of soldiers when they returned from Vietnam, friendly fire.

705899,A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ,B000068TPN,Private Quentin Tarantino Fan,"[2, 2]","Although I was initially hesitant to We Were Soldiers thanks to Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson at the helm, I was pleasantly surprised at We Were Soldiers, which is an honest to god thanks to the soldiers of Vietnam.  Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace butchered impressive ancient warfare with horrendous writing and directing, and I don't even want to think about the horrible abomination known as Pearl Harbor.  Luckily, Randal Wallace learned after all those misfires and created We Were Soldiers, which actually honors the soldiers of The Vietnam War, something no other war film has never really done.  The closest thing?  The Green Berets.  Ugh.  We Were Soldiers is graphic, yes, but as some of the other reviewers can attest, this is what it was really like.  This film succeeds because of this, as it does for Vietnam veterans what Saving Private Ryan did for WW2 Veterans.We Were Soldiers is much different than other war films such as Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket.  While the aforementioned movies do more for me personally, We Were Soldiers is much different from those other films as it gives an honest and straight up thanks to the soldiers of Vietnam.  It strips away most of the the political and tension that went on during the Vietnam War and focuses squarely on the soldiers and the home front.  No other war film before really did an open letter to the soldiers, and for that reason We Were Soldiers is much more superior to say, Platoon.  Even better, it doesn't make the opposing soldiers seem like inhumane monsters either, but it also takes something's viewpoint to determine that, and I'll leave it at that.The film also reduces Mel Gibson to merely just acting (both Braveheart and Passion of the Christ seem they were made by a sadist, and one was silly and the other was a glorified snuff film), something that seemed to help The Patriot as well (though that had another problematic Director, Roland Emmerich).  Although I initially was reluctant to watch this movie thanks to Mel Gibson (reasons above), he gives a stoic and reserved performance, very in contrast to his wildly silly Braveheart performance.  I also do think after watching some Mel Gibson movies that South Park's charicture of Mel Gibson is juvenile and childish beyond belief, even though I can't argue with South Park's spot on observation of The Passion of the Christ (hated it as a Christian, hate it as an Agnostic).We Were Soldiers is a dramatization of the Battle of la Drang, based on Hal Moore's account of the battle as written by him.  For the most part, that's pretty much it.  However, We Were Soldiers works because of that, as it gives a sense of what Vietnam war veterans went through.  Another well made part is the home front, which shows what the people at home go through as well.  While I'm not married, I can really sense what it's like when young couples are seperated, and even more what their wives would feel when they learn of the death of their own husbands.  I also liked the feeling of what it is like to tell a young child what war is about, it's no easy feat to explain that to a child.The battle scenes are extremely well made, and while they have a soundtrack, it adds to the carnage.  They are set in winding fields that add extreme confusion, with high doses of napalm and muzzle attacks.  They sound brutal and amazing, and Wallace's direction adds tension and a sense of instinct that other war films don't have.  This film, like other war films of recent memory, are very violent, with people being burned, people's heads being ripped up by machine guns, and skin sliding off of a soldiers who was doused with napalm.  I do have one problem, and that would be the final charge, as the cheesy voice over ruins that battle.  Luckily.  I really can't find fault in the battle scenes, which are first rate.  I certainly think they did an excellent job at making Vietnam warfare seem very real.I'll give the last word to the Vietnam veterans who have spoken well about this film.  We Were Soldiers is quite underrated actually, and the critics who found it cheesy really need to have their tastes checked, in my opinion.  It may not quite stake out new grounds, but it's still an open letter to the Vietnam war and leaves out all of the crappy politics.  All that ____ really doesn't matter anyway, and no matter how it happened, people are killed either way.  Why the hell does it matter.  Ah, I'm ranting.  Just check We Were Soldiers out.  It likely won't soften up to the hardest cynics, but one who can understand the casualties of each side will surely enjoy it.  If anything, the battle scenes are great.

This vision of war is one of the most realistic and chilling ever put on screen. We Were Soldiers depicts war in a very unflattering and extremely ugly way. There is also a realism to the entire story and battle footage that is hard to ignore. We Were Soldiers has an ""in your face"" realism that somehow cannot be matched by other films about war. There is more we see here as to how the families of these men are handling the days and nights never knowing when or if their men will return home. I particularly enjoyed the portion of the film as our soldiers and their families hear the news that they will be going to Vietnam in just days, and how they react to the realities of it. The commanding officer played by Mel Gibson gives a final speech to his platoon as family members sit nearby in the grandstand. It's a moment that seems extremely realistic script wise, and well detailed in a simple yet realistic manner. Just following is one of my favorite moments in the film, as Gibson's character kisses his wife goodbye, then heads out late in the night with rifle and dufflebag and ends up standing alone in an empty field as the music builds a dramatic and unsettling tone. Then out of the shadows more men arrive, then hundreds, then dozens of buses. It's a powerful moment that forces the audience to feel the unsettling nervous atmosphere as well. It is like the film is saying ""Well audience, your not just going to watch a movie, your gonna get on this bus and you are going to Vietnam"". What is to follow is some of the most realistic, harrowing, and brutal war footage ever filmed and it is astonishing! There is no other war film like We Were Soldiers. It's not there to try to be cinematic or blockbusting.

The book is about the first major battle in the Vietnam war in November 1965 in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam.  Colonel Moore, commanded a battalion of troops who were sent to ""find the enemy.""  Little did they know that they were dropped into the middle of a base camp for an entire Vietnamese Army Division. At the end of the battle, Moore's men won the battle despite the fact that they were ridiculously outnumbered.Through their own memories and extensive research and interviews with those who fought there, Moore and Galloway were able to tell the story of the entire battle as seen through the eyes of soldiers, including the commander of the Vietnamese troops.This film is true to the book and tells the story of the men who fought bravely and died on LZ X-Ray. The director, Randall Wallace said that he set out to make the movie true to the battle after reading that Colonel Moore said that ""Hollywood had gotten the story of the Vietnam soldier wrong every damned time.""If you are looking for a pure action movie, this is not for you.  If you are looking for an ideologic, political movie a la Platoon or Apocalypse Now, this is not your movie.Mel Gibson plays Colonel Moore with much gusto and is very believable as a Lt. Colonel.  Sam Elliott's portrayal of Command Sergeant Major Plumley brought back memories of CSM's and 1st sergeants I knew in my military service. Greg Kinnear as Bruce Crandall, a brave helicopter pilot that kept the wounded moving, the reinforcements and supplies coming.  Barry Pepper rounds out the top four of the cast in a memorable performance as reporter Joe Galloway.  Others  in this movie are Madeleine Stowe, Chris Klein of American Pie fame, Keri Russell (Felicity)and Ryan Hurst (Saving Private Ryan, Remember the Titans).The pace of the movie is very good, beginning with a quick introduction about the Vietnam War.  Showing the troops getting ready to leave their families and the pain their loved ones feel when they do leave.  It then drops us into the middle of battle with cinematography on par with Saving Private Ryan. It is during this time and during the aftermath that we see the incredible bravery and selfless sacrifice on both sides that day. It brought tears to my eyes watching the battle, knowing that this movie was a true account of one of the battles of Vietnam.  The movie also cuts back to the homefront, where the wives eagerly await the return of their husbands and dread the receipt of news that they have become a widow.Being a veteran of our U.S. Army, maybe I am more sentimental to movies of this nature than non-veterans.  I have seen more war movies than I can remember.  I'll say this...never have I been more moved or more touched or more proud after watching a movie about the brave men of our military.  I am not ashamed to say that I wept during this film.  The portrayal of the battle and the camaraderie of men during battle is dead on and moved me to tears.  The carnage of the war and the dead and dying was hard to watch.  I was very touched that this movie showed the war back home, which has not happened in any film that I can remember.  This movie portrayed the anxiety and fear of the soldiers' wives, who awaited their return and feared every day that they would become widows.If you want and ideological spin on the Vietnam war made by people who won't stop talking about its failures, rent Platoon or another movie.  If you want to watch a tribute to thos soldiers, and see true heroism and the sacrifice that our soldiers made back then and continue to make today, watch this movie.""Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one's life for his friends.""",5,Hollywood Finally Got It Right...,1101168000,"11 23, 2004",2004,3986,"['reading', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'complaining', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'political', 'crusade', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'veterans', 'out', 'be', 'criminals', 'druggies', 'had', 'write', 'review.This', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'Once', 'Young', 'then', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'Hal', 'Moore', 'reporter', 'Joe', 'Galloway', 'book', 'first', 'major', 'battle', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'November', '1965', 'Ia', 'Drang', 'Valley', 'Vietnam', 'Colonel', 'Moore', 'commanded', 'battalion', 'troops', 'who', 'were', 'sent', 'find', 'enemy', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'were', 'dropped', 'middle', 'base', 'camp', 'entire', 'Vietnamese', 'Army', 'Division', 'end', 'battle', 'Moore', 'men', 'won', 'battle', 'fact', 'were', 'ridiculously', 'own', 'memories', 'extensive', 'research', 'interviews', 'who', 'fought', 'there', 'Moore', 'Galloway', 'were', 'able', 'tell', 'story', 'entire', 'battle', 'seen', 'eyes', 'soldiers', 'including', 'commander', 'Vietnamese', 'troops.This', 'film', 'true', 'book', 'story', 'men', 'who', 'fought', 'bravely', 'died', 'LZ', 'X-Ray', 'director', 'Randall', 'Wallace', 'said', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'movie', 'true', 'battle', 'reading', 'Colonel', 'Moore', 'said', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'gotten', 'story', 'Vietnam', 'soldier', 'wrong', 'damned', 'time', 'are', 'looking', 'pure', 'action', 'movie', 'not', 'are', 'looking', 'ideologic', 'political', 'movie', 'la', 'Platoon', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'not', 'movie.Mel', 'Gibson', 'Colonel', 'Moore', 'much', 'gusto', 'very', 'believable', 'Lt', 'Colonel', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'portrayal', 'Command', 'Sergeant', 'Major', 'Plumley', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'CSM', '1st', 'sergeants', 'knew', 'military', 'service', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Bruce', 'Crandall', 'brave', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'kept', 'wounded', 'moving', 'reinforcements', 'supplies', 'coming', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'out', 'top', 'four', 'cast', 'memorable', 'performance', 'reporter', 'Joe', 'Galloway', 'Others', 'movie', 'are', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'American', 'Pie', 'fame', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'Felicity', 'Ryan', 'Hurst', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Remember', 'Titans', '.The', 'pace', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'beginning', 'quick', 'introduction', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Showing', 'troops', 'getting', 'ready', 'leave', 'families', 'pain', 'loved', 'ones', 'feel', 'when', 'do', 'leave', 'then', 'middle', 'battle', 'cinematography', 'par', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'time', 'aftermath', 'see', 'incredible', 'bravery', 'selfless', 'sacrifice', 'sides', 'day', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'watching', 'battle', 'knowing', 'movie', 'was', 'true', 'account', 'one', 'battles', 'Vietnam', 'movie', 'also', 'back', 'homefront', 'where', 'wives', 'eagerly', 'await', 'return', 'husbands', 'dread', 'receipt', 'news', 'have', 'become', 'widow.Being', 'veteran', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'maybe', 'am', 'more', 'sentimental', 'movies', 'nature', 'non-veterans', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'war', 'movies', 'can', 'remember', ""'ll"", 'say', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'moved', 'more', 'touched', 'more', 'proud', 'watching', 'movie', 'brave', 'men', 'military', 'am', 'not', 'ashamed', 'say', 'wept', 'film', 'portrayal', 'battle', 'camaraderie', 'men', 'battle', 'dead', 'moved', 'tears', 'carnage', 'war', 'dead', 'dying', 'was', 'hard', 'watch', 'was', 'very', 'touched', 'movie', 'showed', 'war', 'back', 'home', 'not', 'happened', 'film', 'can', 'remember', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'soldiers', 'wives', 'who', 'awaited', 'return', 'feared', 'day', 'would', 'become', 'want', 'ideological', 'spin', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'made', 'people', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'talking', 'failures', 'rent', 'Platoon', 'movie', 'want', 'watch', 'tribute', 'thos', 'soldiers', 'see', 'true', 'heroism', 'sacrifice', 'soldiers', 'made', 'back', 'then', 'continue', 'make', 'today', 'watch', 'movie', 'Greater', 'love', 'one', 'lay', 'down', 'one', 'life', 'friends']",N/A

705908,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B000068TPN,Reviewer,"[90, 102]","The title of the memoir that inspired this film, ""We Were Soldiers Once...And Young,"" written by Lt. General Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway, says much about what this film ultimately conveys, as in a few words it addresses the state of being of the individuals, as well as the country, which so soon would be embroiled in one of the most controversial wars in the history of America.  ""We Were Soldiers,"" adapted for the screen and directed by Randall Wallace, is an uncompromising look at war and the commitment of those who wage it.  It's a true story told realistically, and moreover, in terms that are humanistic rather than political, which succeeds in making it a riveting drama that is both absorbing and emotionally involving.It's November, 1965; some 400 American troops-- the 7th Cavalry-- led by Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), take the field at LZ X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam, where they are quickly surrounded by over 2000 North Vietnamese soldiers.  The ensuing battle will last for three days, and it marks the first major confrontation between America and North Vietnam, a battle from which many, on both sides, will not walk away; and on hand to record it as it happens, is reporter Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper).  Going in, Moore knows what they are up against, and he promises his men two things:  That he will be the first to set foot on the field and the last to leave it; and he will bring every man back home with him, alive or dead-- no one will be left behind.  And it's a promise he keeps.With this film, Wallace succeeds where two other, recent depictions of historic battles, ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Black Hawk Down""-- both good films in their own right-- failed; and it's because he managed to achieve just the right balance between the rendering of the battle itself and the human element involved.  Of the two, ""Pearl Harbor"" is a close runner-up; the love story leading up to the battle was perhaps a bit extended, though ultimately engaging, whereas ""Black Hawk Down"" put the viewer in the battle, but was emotionally uninvolving.  Here, Wallace not only gives you a battle that is brilliantly staged and presented, but before he takes you there he makes sure you know those who are about to die, and the loved ones they are leaving behind.  War has many casualties, and they are not all on the battlefield; and beyond the realism of the fight, this is where Wallace makes his strongest statement, as during the three days of the battle he makes you privy to what the soldiers wives and families are going through at home, as well, waiting for the dreaded Western Union telegrams being delivered by cab drivers because the army wasn't prepared to deal with it.The film is effective because Wallace keeps the human element at the heart of the story while he presents a perspective to which the audience can relate on very personal terms.  In short, he gives you the ""whole story,"" that enables you to know the horror of the firefight, as well as the throat clenching terror of seeing a yellow cab drive up to the front of your house, knowing full well what it means.  This is a prime example of filmmaking and storytelling at it's best; and it's a commendable achievement by Wallace.Gibson is perfectly cast and does an excellent job of bringing Hal Moore to life with a convincing portrayal of a man dedicated to both his family and his life as a soldier.  Moore is focused and determined, and Gibson makes us realize that he knows the seriousness of what he is about to undertake, as well as the possible dire consequences thereof.  The real strength of the character, however, is in the fact that he is not some kind of superhero out to win the war single-handedly, but a man who lives and loves and feels like anyone else, who bleeds when he is cut and hurts when he loses one of his men.  A man who feels guilty that he is still living when his men die.  And it's all captured in Gibson's strong and credible performance.Besides Gibson, there are a number of exceptional supporting performances in this film, most notably, Madeleine Stowe, as Julie Moore, Hal's wife; Sam Elliott, as the gruff and seasoned veteran, Sergeant Major Basil Plumley; Greg Kinnear, as Major Bruce Crandall, the helicopter pilot with a memorable nickname; Chris Klein, as Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan, a new father to whom Moore gives a perspective on the war that enables him to face the job he must do; Keri Russell, as Barbara Geoghegan, the young wife and new mother who must watch her husband go off to fulfill his destiny; and Pepper, turning in an extremely affecting performance as Joe Galloway.The supporting cast includes Ryan Hurst (Sergeant Savage), Mark McCracken (Ed ""Too Tall"" Freeman), Edwin Morrow (Willie), Jsu Garcia (Captain Nadal), Matt Mangum (Private Soprano), Brian Tee (Nakayama), Joseph Hieu (NVA Major), Don Duong (Ahn), Alan Dale (Westmoreland) and Simbi Khali (Alma).  A film like this goes far in demonstrating the power and effectiveness of the medium that created it; it will never, however, enable us to understand war, because war-- in all it's myriad manifestations-- is beyond human comprehension.  But it has always been with us and always will be, and a film that is well made and presented, a film like ""We Were Soldiers,"" is important because it lends a needed perspective that allows us to take a step back and consider the magnitude of our endeavors in these regards, and the price we must pay for freedom.  It leaves one with a sense of pride and patriotism, but tempered with a sobering concern for seeking altruistic alternatives.  It may be only a dream; but hopefully, it's one that someday all the people of the world will share.",5,Who Can Explain Such Things?,1015891200,"03 12, 2002",2002,5702,"['title', 'memoir', 'inspired',

How reassuring to see humane portrayals of men in arms--of men who make a career of service and devotion to country, whether American or Vietnamese. If, like me, you've grown weary and wary of war films that depict officers as inept or gung ho, soldiers as bewildered, misled, and demented, you will enjoy this film. As one whose father served in that war twice, it touches a cord. This is also the first film to show how the families must cope with daddies in combat. The scene between the Gibson character and his youngest daughter is poignant and reminiscent of Stewart talking to his sick daughter in ""It's A Wonderful Life."" No Hollywood glitz and distortion here. Neither is there too much lecturing and political statement making as you see in the Stone and Kubrick films. Even the drill instructor is believable in his role. The focus, to be sure, is on the officers of these men. The film is not without moments of humor but the pathos pervades it. The scenes of Gibson reviewing history books on the French fiasco in Nam in the 1950's and Custer's Last Stand are eerie and instructive. THIS IS THE ONLY 'NAM FILM that shows the actions of a single military offensive from start to finish. Gibson is superb in this role despite what others have said. He is visceral but also contemplative--a delicate balance worthy of academy award consideration. This film will get overlooked by the academy because it is too thoughtful for a war film but don't let yourself be deprived of its endearment and lessons, and stirring but not exaggerated portrayals. These are real men thrust into unreal circumstances. Although the Vietnamese perspective is brief and appears a token gesture of concern, the commander of their forces is a good counterbalance to Gibson's--he, too, is well-reasoned, not demonic. The scenes of the housewives awaiting news from Nam are also unforgettable.

Mel Gibson has been made famous for battling against the British(Patriot, Braveheart, etc.)and now he has moved onto the Vietnamese.The Battle Scenes: The battle scenes are some of the worst ever filmed. Vietnamese soldiers just jump into open firing range and fall over fakely. It seems like the Vietnamese are on a suicide rage than fighting. And there's way too much of this throughout the entire feature. And one Vietnamese soldier just runs strait at the Americans until Mel blows his head off. The Vietnamese are actually smarter than what you see onscreen.The ""Family"" Scenes: Of all the bad scenes in this film I have to say these are the worst of them all. All the wives are there, one has a baby, the father of course dies along with others, and all of this results in a sappy crying fit. The other scenes contain 2 women walking around handing out letters to other wives about their fallen husbands all with the same predictable results.That's all I have to say.

I was expecting something at least decent, but instead saw what I believe to be one of the best war films that I have ever seen.This is the latest in a string of films that attempts to make the combat sequences as accurate and as life like as possible. I have read a number of books about wars, warfare, and battle, and in them one constantly reads about the amount of smoke that there is on a battlefield. Most films take cinematic liberties, however, making the battlefield as clear as possible in order that the viewer can follow the action. In WE WERE SOLDIERS, however, much of the battle takes place is an artificial fog.One of the best things about this film, as opposed to other battle films, is that you get to see how the battle looked from both sides. The Vietnamese are not presented as faceless, almost inhuman forces as in most films, but we get to see them as human beings, and their own strategy and tactics are displayed. One shot in particular stood out for me. A Vietnamese soldier pauses in the hollowed out part of a tree, breathing hard, changing the clip on his rifle, and then putting on the bayonet. Then, he stands for a second, battling his fear, before forcing himself to move from cover and attack. You can probably count the number of war films on one hand that would have portrayed the enemy in such a human light.The film as a whole, despite containing some very intense battle sequences, is as concerned to focus on the human dimension as much as the military. This may be the most purely emotional war film that I have ever seen. It is also filled with many individuals acts of moral courage, such as when Col. Moore's wife demands that the cab company deliver all the telegram's from the war department to her instead of the individual wives, telegram's that informed them of their husbands' deaths.The cast was, for the most part, excellent. Mel Gibson was as solid as usual. Barry Pepper was marvelous as reporter (and real life book co-author) Joey Galloway. I wonder why we don't see more of him. He has been thoroughly enjoyable in everything I have seen him in. Sam Eliott has always been on of my favorites, and he stood out in this one as Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley.A very good movie, and while I would caution that it is very, very violent, and graphically so, I would also urge anyone who has been putting this one off, to give it a try.

The majority of the execution falls flat.Let's run through the list of stereotypes: we've got good ol' Mel, trying his gosh-darndest to not leave a single man behind; Mel's hard-ass SOB veteran major who's killed oodles of foreigners in other wars; the idealistic, loving, and coincidentally totally hot war wives; not one, but TWO naive youngsters with a future ahead of them and newborns at home who die (oops, did I give something away?); and of course, plenty of practically immobile Asians to gun down whenever slow-motion shots of American soldiers won't suffice.At its best, the film starkly depicts the horrors of war; at its worst (which it leans towards for the majority), it's merely a by-product of sappy post 9/11 sentiments.Good enough story, bad execution, cliches by the barrelful.

Col Hal Moore, commanding, puts in an outstanding performance.  Gibson is intense and true-to-life without overdoing the role (which would have been easy to do given the nature of the film).  This film does not glorify war, but does recognize the bravery (and flaws/weaknesses) of the soldiers who fought a hard, tough, thankless war because, in the end, it was their duty.One thing the film does that most war films do not is focus on the home front, both before and during the battle.  Despite this, this is neither a pro-war or an anti-war story.  I thought that it did a pretty good job of recognizing both the skill and heroism of the soldiers on the one hand, and the tragedies that war inevitably entails on the other.  Unlike some other movies that have dealt with the Vietnam war, this film does not portray the American Army in a negative light, which is frankly refreshing, and perhaps reflective of the high esteem in which most Americans hold the military in the present day.Too intense for children, but a very fine and powerful war story that will hold the interest of most viewers.",4,"War in all its glory, horror, and ugliness.

705921,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000068TPN,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 6]","World War II has been tagged by some with the rather oxymoronic appellation ""the last good war.""  What this means is that the ""heroes"" and ""villains"" in this epic conflict were so clear-cut and obvious - and the goals so straightforward and crucial - that filmmakers approaching the subject haven't needed to bother much with exploring the moral complexities that lie at the root of all war, that most inhumane of human endeavors.  Films set in World War II have almost invariably reflected a sense of moral certitude, with the Allied nations seen as the forces of Good locked in a life-and-death struggle with the forces of Evil represented by the Axis powers.This is not, of course, the way Americans came, for the most part, to view the Vietnam War.  Faced with no clearly defined enemy or menace, many Americans came to question their country's involvement in what seemed from a distance to be a civil war between two alien nations and cultures.  Thus, when it finally came time for filmmakers to address this issue, their films naturally reflected much of the moral ambiguity that defined the nation as a whole.  Films like ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Platoon,"" ""Apocalypse Now"" etc. not only questioned the moral rightness of our involvement and actions in that conflict, but actually made us question whether heroism - on the scale of the common soldier caught in the conflict - was even a valid possibility.The new film, ""We Were Soldiers"" attempts to rectify that skepticism, trying to counterbalance the films like those listed above, while at the same time serving as a long overdue and honorable tribute to the brave young men who fought and died doing their duty on that strange foreign soil.  The film, thereby, endeavors to bring the WWII war film sensibility to one set in Vietnam.  In order to focus our attention on the individual heroism of the men involved, the film first has had to drain the narrative of its entire sociopolitical context.  Since this is the story of the first major battle between the Americans and the Viet Cong - in November 1965 - one would naturally expect to hear quite a bit of discourse - both among the military leaders and the rank-and-file combat soldiers - as to the why and wherefore of both the conflict and the Americans' reason for taking part in it.  Yet, we get none of this.  All the soldiers involved simply do their duty without question, an attitude which becomes, in effect, the film's operative definition of the word ""heroism.""  This is what separates ""We Were Soldiers"" from those previous Vietnam War films.  The characters in those other movies were also dying bravely, but they always seemed to be questioning the powers-that-be that got them into the situation in the first place.  In ""We Were Soldiers,"" no one ever questions.  The need to follow orders is simply accepted as a given - and thus heroism becomes a matter of doing one's duty and of helping one's comrade regardless of any overarching justification for the slaughter.  Without having to wade through all the moral murkiness of the conflict itself, we are thus freed up to admire the sheer courage and determination of the men.  In fact, the film even makes a few good willed nods in the direction of equanimity by showing that even the Viet Cong fighters, who are attempting to kill all these fine young American men, also have girlfriends and families they love back home.Given this self-imposed myopia, ""We Were Soldiers,"" nevertheless, does an admirable job honoring these men.  Like most war movies, so much time is spent on the pyrotechnics of battle that little time is left to engage in any real character development.  ""We Were Soldiers"" attempts to flesh out its characters in the opening stretch when we see several of the men with their wives and families before embarking on their mission.  But once they hit the ground in Vietnam, all hell breaks loose and most of the men become lost in the chaos of this seemingly interminable battle.  The film does a terrific job recreating the horror of the fighting, never flinching from the grim reality that is war.  The carnage is appropriately gruesome and the filmmakers make sure that we see every last bit of the grotesquerie that the act of unbridled human butchery has to offer.  The special effects team has done an extraordinary job bringing all this to life on the screen.Although a few of the early family scenes seem treacly at best, some of the film's most profoundly moving moments occur back home, when Julia Moore (Madeleine Stowe), the wife of the film's protagonist, Lt. Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), takes it upon herself to deliver the ""death telegrams"" to the other wives on the base.Gibson does an admirable job as the man in charge of the mission, displaying both a rugged strength and a compassionate love for his men that makes him a well-rounded character.  One appreciates the fact that the writers, Joseph L. Galloway and Harold G. Moore himself (upon whose life and book this true story is based) don't require Moore to indulge in the kind of cheap theatrical heroics common to characters of this type.  He is a man whose level-headedness and grace under fire help lead his men on to victory in an almost impossible situation.  This is also a rare instance in which a character is allowed to have a religious dimension without being made into a fool in the process.Randall Wallace, as the film's director, seems equally at home in the battle sequences and in the quieter moments of subtle sadness that permeate the scenes at home.""We Were Soldiers,"" for all its simplicity of theme, manages to be a moving tribute to the young men who found the personal courage to put their lives on the line, with or without a cause that made any sense.",3,simplistic but powerful war film,1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,5749,"['World', 'War',

I don't know why else I didn't give it one star because this was a simplistic, plotless, corny, and silly film with nearly 90% of it taken up with Civil War-style battle and the remaining part consumed with nothing.Soldiers who came back from Vietnam, when asked if they had ever killed anyone, often said, ""I don't know."" That's because the enemy was hidden, crafty, experienced. Wearing immaculate khaki uniforms? That is silly beyond belief.Why Mel didn't get his head shot off was a mystery to me. Just like Custer, he stood up and walked around during the onslaughts in a field that reminded me of southern Wisconsin. Didn't whoever made this bomb ever hear that they fought in a jungle? A bullet even bounced off Mel's shoulder. What a man! In Forrest Gump, Lieutenant Dan had the brains to keep his head down.Several times we were treated to fake blood splashed on the camera lens.

The inclusion of the wives/girlfriends and their emotional gut wrenching roller coaster ride of terror, grief, hope, lose and the fear of the unknown. The story also includes a look into the eyes, hearts and minds of the enemy in a way that is seldom done and is viewed from a human perspective instead of a non or sub human perspective.I also like to watch this because its so well made from every angle and after some investigation I found the story to be more factual than not and without the all to familiar over the top hollywood BS. I'm sure that some of the hollyweird junk did make its way into the movie, but again to a lesser degree.It always pulls at my heart strings when I watch this movie  and when I watch them fly away from that battlefield and the NVA return after all the bloodshed I keep asking WHY? I know the answer, but I don't like it. The engagement was a test for a new unproven style of fighting tactics and as a test to size up the enemy and its capabilities.The movie does a good job of giving you get an idea (but from the safety of your home) of the intensity, confusion, fear, tension (and the list is much to long to post here) and the feeling of impending doom of being overrun that they were going through, albeit a little tension and a quickend pulse rate. The movie can't test the viewers metal to see if you can handle war or succumb to the horrific and tramatic effects it has on the mind and body, but it can and does give the viewer a glimpse into the chaos that is unfolding all around you. I like war movies for some of the previously mentioned reasons and in part because of my age and growing up with so many of them that involved the Revolutionary war, The Alamo, American Indian wars, The Civil war, The Spanish American war, WWI and WWII, the Korean war and the Vietnam war, Granada, Desert Storm (Iraq I), Iraq II and the Afganistan wars.When I was growing up the wars were glamorized and romanticized until the Vietnam war and its polarizing effects that led to our countries disgraceful treatment of our Vietnam Vets. This is one person that was sicken by the treatment of the guys (girls) I knew and the many many many more that I didn't know. Thankfully my dad was a WWII Vet and he and my mom taught me better than that. They taught me that whether you are for or against any war that you support those who will lay down their lives for this country!!! Sorry for the rant, but its close to my heart.If you are looking for a closer to the truth or factual war movie (Vietnam) that is incredably well produced that delves into tactics, comraderie, wives perspective, helicopters, napalm, air strikes, survival and a whole lot more?

Mel Gibson is one of the few actors who could anchor this film with his star persona, but he can't save this film from its own false heart.

As an air force brat, I lived through these years and watched my father leave the house on many mornings -- and I watched my mother's galvanized terror and fear.  There is none of that here.  On the battlefield, the blood virtually never stops flowing, in ways that make you think that the director kept trying to find new, novel ways of making a body explode -- so much so that he actually lets blood drip onto the camera, which of course reminds you that you are watching a movie.

705932,A2FA18B50XGXJX,B000068TPN,Sam Damon Jr.,"[3, 8]","Technotactically, the film shows the fire-swept weapons battlefield but with a new twist; both sides have full automatic assault rifles; M16s versus ""AK-47s"" (AKMs); with a trigger squeeze a group of men bunched together can be cut down. Moore has anticipated this, and as Crandall flies in ammo boxes, the later loaded 5.56mm magazines are distributed by conscious effort of the leaders--he and Plumley---to keep a ""wall of fire"" between them and the enemy regimental headquarters they have stumbled onto at the base of a forested mountain in the Ia Drang valley. Gibson's time spent weapons handling with the Benning Rangers results in Moore's palm slapping the bolt catch on his M16 after every magazine reload like a professional Soldier, an efficiency us lefties have a hard hard time duplicating.The need for responsive Close Air Support (CAS) by a slow-moving aircraft like the A-1 SkyRaiders that can drop napalm is something we lack in the present day; making it questionable how we will fare if given the long odds for survival Moore's men faced. We see the technotactical ploys of the enemy to flank, countered by Moore's massing, then the enemy's ""belt buckle"" hugging countered by Moore's ""mad minute"" which shows that conflicts are often won or lost in the minds of the Commanders. The Commander with the last remaining trump usually triumphs--in those dark days in the Ia Drang, Moore's ""broken arrow"" request for CAS and ability to feed fresh troops into battle by helicopter held together by his skilled on-the-scene, personal leadership won the fight.After the battle, where Moore had acted with complete disregard for his own safety, he feels survivor's guilt as a moral man aware of his fallen troopers sacrifices and insists that someday AP photographer Joe Galloway tell the sleeping American public what his men did to protect their freedom and the price they paid; the genesis of the book and this film. Moore knows that if he does not act, his men will be as forgotten as much as they were ignored when they left---he will not tolerate this--he fights back---he just doesn't bring his men back home alive or to be buried; he brings them back home to our hearts so they will be remembered forever by every generation of living Americans when they reflect on the lives of peace they get to enjoy and how they must also be Soldiers even if they are young.The film as all films are under a serious time pressure, has two huge flaws that can fortunately can be fixed by a ""director's cut"" using some additional scenes. As-is, the film may make you think that tactical AIRCRAFT did most of the killing and if our men-on-the-ground endured so much agony, their families endured so much grief, why not just leave our ground Soldiers out of it? If all war is; is the act of exploding and killing, why not just do it from the air as western democracies are wont to embrace as a panacea? This is the result of a misunderstanding that the film's scripting/editing creates; a lack of geostrategic perspective that was the true cause of the men being hastily sent in 1965. Unless I failed to hear the film clearly, we are presented that the 1st Air Cavalry was sent in as a symbolic gesture to prop up a faltering South Vietnam, when the truth is much more than that.I believe a scene should be added where the two senior Pentagon officers point a finger at a map of South Vietnam and describe how its narrow at the Central Highlands near Pleiku and with the enemy massing somewhere there, they could cut the nation into two by ground maneuver. The scene where Moore and Plumley land and get their orders to seek and find the massing enemy should reinforce this point by a sub-title caption reading ""Assembly Area, X miles from Pleiku"" etc. to connect the fact that the 1st Air Cavalry was sent to counter the MANEUVER of the enemy from holding important ground not as just another way of killing enemies using helicopters and Sky Soldiers.Another missing aspect of the film is that the Army was developing a light tracked tank called the AR/AAV that would be deliverable by helicopter but was not available at the time of the 1965 battle. The details of this are recounted by General Moore in General David L. Grange's ""Air-Mech-Strike"" book. The first scenes in the movie where Pentagon officers select Moore where they mention his experimental parachute work for General Gavin should be modified in the director's cut to bring up the fact that Moore had worked on the AR/AAV light airdroppable tank that could be lifted by a helicopter but its not ready and the situation in Vietnam is too critical to wait. The officers should remark that the Air Cav will have to fight with what they carry in their hands and on their backs. They should end by saying they hope it will be enough.In this subtle way, the conclusion of the movie would be more accurate and not feed into the current aversion to using ground troops which results in enemies escaping, while providing the audience a valuable ""lessons learned"" that America must IMPROVE the WAY she sends her men to fight; by declaring war so the entire nation rallies behind the men spiritually and physically to include supplying them with ALL the tools they need--to include a light tracked armored vehicle so gatling guns will not be left behind as Custer did. If the weather had gone sour, the ""guns"" on the aircraft could not have flown to assist Moore in his successful stand---future Air Cav type units must instead land with their own gatling guns on armored mounts with lots of ammo to insure they can sweep the areas of ""indians"" and win the fight to come home again.",5,PT 2: the war across the ocean: right message to the future?,1036022400,"10

705937,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000068TPN,Scott Schiefelbein,"[10, 11]","&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; is a U-turn for American films about Vietnam.  For years, the best flicks about the war highlighted the nation's disillusionment and cynicism about our involvement in Southeast Asia -- &quot;Apocalypse Now,&quot; &quot;Platoon,&quot; &quot;Full Metal Jacket,&quot; and &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; leave the viewer bereft, wondering how to deal with that ball of ice in your stomach.  But each of these films looks back with regret, wtih &quot;if we only knew the truth at the beginning, we wouldn't have gotten involved over there in that hideous war.&quot;&quot;We Were Soldiers,&quot; on the other hand, captures the America at the beginning of the Vietnam conflict.  Most of the soldiers are the earnest, happy-go-lucky young guys we got in the John Wayne war films . . . before they go off to war, they sing and dance with their wives and girlfriends, and they show an innocent heroism under fire.  Only the senior officers, played by Mel Gibson and Sam Elliott, know the truth about war and how savage the Vietnam conflict will be. Mel, as the senior commander, gets a bit jingoistic at times, but that his depiction is apparently dead-on for those who know the real-life commander (who was a consultant on the film).  Sam Elliott, as the grizzled second-in-command, is a wonder -- he stalks the movie with a barely concealed fury, terrifying his own soldiers, but has a moment of exquisite tenderness and leadership with one of his boys.Like the young soldiers, the audience gets its education on how the conflict will be -- the Vietnamese, who are given a humanity rarely seen in Vietnam movies, still charge with near-suicidal determination.  We see napalm in its hideous applications.  We see the terror of a unit cut off from the main force overnight.  We are stunned by seeing what men can endure and we despair because no man should have to experience the hell of that battlefield.The movie truly shines with its parallel storyline of the wives and girlfriends back in Georgia who wait for news of their loved ones in combat . . . or, more accurately, pray that they do not receive news.  The movie's most touching scenes revolve around the delivery of the &quot;We regret to inform you . . . &quot; telegrams announcing the death of another soldier to their families.  Anyone who can watch these scenes without heartache has not heart.The DVD also contains some nice extras, including deleted scenes with director's commentary.

The Vietnames soldiers were about twelve feet away, yet they scored zero hits on US soldiers in fight after fight. Also, the enemy had zero artillery. Not even so much as a mortar round landed on the American positions. I'm pretty sure that at least some form of artillery would be standard issue for any North Vietnamese division (or any division in the world, for that matter).

And, as other reviewers here have noted, most ""Vietnam"" movies tend to concentrate on politics, propaganda or the just plain weird (to this day I'm still not sure what, despite its cinematic phantasmagoria, exactly Francis Ford Coppola was trying to say with ""Apocalypse Now"").""We Were Soldiers"" eschews all three.  The prism through which Randall Wallace presents his film is the experience of Lt. Gen. Hal Moore (Ret.), Joe Galloway's and the officers and men of the 7th Air Cavalry.  Geopolitics and the macroview are irrelevant here.  As Hal Moore puts it, this is the story of survival, and brotherhood, under the most horrendous things man can do to man.As Barry Pepper's Joe Galloway, reporter UPI and co-author of the book upon which the movie is based, tells us, in a voice over at the end of the movie, ""[The veterans of Vietnam] went to war because their government ordered them to... But[in the end] they fought for each other.""  And that, more than anything else, is what this movie captures more poignantly and realistically than any other ""Vietnam"" ever has or is ever likely to.The camraderie of the battlefield is something only those who have survived it can truly understand.  Randal Wallace, the masterful, intensely human Mel Gibson (the irrational, ridiculously petty hatred of him that is expressed by some reviewers mars what are otherwise some good reviews) and the superb cast bring the brutal reality, fear, the blood, death, tragedy, dirt, and the sheer horror as close to the reality as a movie is ever likely to.  Just as ""Saving Private Ryan"" stripped World War II of the rose colored prism of Audie Murphy heroics (one is tempted to say ""melodramatics"") to reveal what was ultimately an ugly, horrible conflict, ""We Were Soldiers"" does something like the opposite.  The Vietnam soldier is FINALLY presented as neither war criminal (""Babykillers!"") or only as a pawn of myopic, idiot politicians, obsessed with the quotidian (though he certainly was that) ""kill-ratios.""Everytime I watch this movie I find myself feeling deeply moved, the emotions nearly as strong as when I saw the Wall in DC in high school.  As I watched it with my father, who was too old for Vietnam, we both found ourselves in tears.  With stark simplicity this film brings the reality home of what it the was ultimately was about: the men who fought and died in it.  The men who were seared together in a bond of brotherhood that transcended the political, racial and religious divisions that were (and still are) rending our national fabric.  To the soldiers, as Galloway's narration tells us, what they became together was more important than anything else.If ""We Were Soldiers"" leaves you with nothing else, it should be the penultimate image of the airport, where one 7th Cav vet pushes another, wheelchair bound, through the airport--with no marching bands, no crowds of of eager families, no TV news cameras to ""hail the conquering heroes.""  The Vietnam veteran came home very much as he'd left it: quiet and unnoticed.  Though occasionally denounced & insulted, he was far often simply forgotten; he was an unwanted & visible reminder of the tremendous upheaval our society had endured.  The country wanted to forgot that and the easiest way was to forget him.""We who have seen war will never stop seeing war,"" Galloway tell us, and no movie can be anything but a pale echo of that reality.  But what a deeply moving pathos Wallace and Gibson bring to it!There is an intangible quality this movie captures what few war movies, and no Vietnam movie, have ever brought tbeen able to do.  If Hal Moore himself, in one of the documentaries on the DVD, can say, ""[This is] the first movie that gets it right,"" what more needs to be said?Watch the movie with awe and gratitude for it gives to the men who fought in the Ia Drang in 14-16 NOV, 1965, what Lincoln did for the men who had fought 102 years earlier at Gettysburg:  a monument so that we can ""never forget what they [gave]...the last full measure of devotion.""Wallace and Gibson give us a tribute to those brave young men (four of whom won the Congressional Medal of Honor during the battle) that ""neither adds nor detracts"" but presents it as closely as any work of art ever can.I can never know what it was like to fight and die in that place.  I can never know, equally, what it was like to wait, anxious and benumbed, as the wives and families of the men of the 7th Air Cav.  To repeat, nothing can ever give these experiences of those men and women to those who didn't live through, but this movie finally allows me to understand, on some small level, what is was like to be ""soldiers [then] and young.""",5,"Vietnam's ""Private Ryan""",1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,5368,"['was', 'three', 'yrs', 'old', 'when', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'ended', 'America', '1973', 'everyone',

These poor guys were in a world of hurt from the time the hit the ground.This is a really good film. The authenticity and attention to detail are phenominal. All the way from the French in 1956 up through the actual battle that US 7th Cavalary was in. Wow!The attention to the detail of how the soldier's wives had to cope with the deaths. It must have been a terrible time. The US Army did not handle it well.395 American GIs against 4,000+ North Vietnam regulars. These weren't the Viet Cong that you normally see in films. The regulars were well equipped and well trained. Their officers knew the ways of war. This particular NVA officer had been in nearly constant battle since the Japanese occupation in the 1940's.Gibson and Elliot were superb in their roles as the two American leaders. I can't imagine going into battle knowing that you only have airlift capability for 60 soldiers at a time and having a 30 - 40 minute gap between air drops. One sustained firefight and you would burn through all your ammo... If you were wounded right when you jumped out of the chopper, it could be more than 90 minutes before you were evacuated. Nothing good about that...The first 40 minutes was introducing the characters and showing you how the unit was trained. This was America's first ""Air Mobile"" unit. New tactics and doctrines. This was the first major battle in the Vietnam Conflict. Once the unit hit the ground, the battle was on. The whole rest of the film concentrates on the battle. No let up in the action.I watched the DVD. Plenty of excellent special features on this one. The section on the makeing of the film was especially interesting. Interviews with the survivors, how they created the battlefield, the weapons involved, the aircraft, the explosions... Very good. The director spent a lot of time getting it right. The veterans seemed to be satisfied with the accuracy. Other special features included director's commentary, deleted scenes, movie trailers.But, when it all said and done, you don't walk away from this film feeling good. It was a major battle. Both sides declared it a victory. Neither side stayed and held onto the ground. A lot of men died. A lot of brutal close up in your face fighting.

705949,A3HPOCPJJQNMWN,B000068TPN,SS-3,"[19, 22]","First off let me say that this is one of my favorite war movies of all time. I owned this previously on DVD and I have seen it at least a half dozen times.PQ - The picture quality on this one was rather disappointing. I don't mind grain and actually prefer if over DNR. However, the image was soft throughout most the picture and quite honestly was only marginally better than my upscaled DVD of this movie. I would say that this and 28 Days are the worst Blu-rays I own in regards to picture quality. Both on Blu-ray only offer a slight upgrade from an upscaled DVD.AQ -I first knocked one point off for no lossless track. I then knocked a second point off becuase I had to frequently adjust the volume. The action scenes were great and you feel like your in the movie. The dialog during these scenes is suprisingly good as well. The problem is when you go to the non action scenes you can barely hear the dialogue. Hence my one point deduction for this issue. I also knocked another point off for a flaw in the DTS audio track. I noticed towards the end of the movie that I was getting audio spikes. A couple of examples are when Mel Gibson returns home to his wife at the door and when the credits were rolling. I noted that my Pioneer Elite receiver was stating +4 for volume, it would go up for a second or two and then back down. This typically takes place at the begginning of the movie and I know it is encoded within the Blu-ray. I noticed this issue about 3 - 4 times so I was kind and only deducted one star for this issue.Extras - Basically the same as the DVD release. Nothing really to add here other than the fact they are average in quantity. However, the content on the commentaries and some of the special features are really good.Overall - If you have the DVD and a good to high-end upscaling DVD player then this is probably not worth an upgrade.

705950,A3CYS74ICMQGF7,B000068TPN,S. Smith,"[11, 13]","It is sadly clear that many of the negative reviews of this film are based on a lack of understanding of the history of the Vietnam War.  While this film does have its defects, it is correct in most of the particulars of the battle, and furthermore is fairly accurate concerning the qualities of the U.S. soldiers that fought in the Ia Drang valley in 1965.The Army in 1965 was very different from the Army in 1968 or 1972.  The level of training of the troops was better, and their attitude towards the war was much more optimistic.  This reflected the public attitudes towards the Vietnam War in the United States in 1965, which were overwhelmingly pro-war.  The disillusionment with the war, the vehement anti-war protests, the discrediting of the Johnson administration, and the gradual decay of the Army's morale and combat ability were IN THE FUTURE.  The 1st Cavalry Division was a well-trained and well-disciplined unit, and while it contained plenty of draftees, their attitudes were generally very different than they were later in the war.  Remember that the public supported the war at this time, and their attitudes reflected the public attitudes.  Likewise, the problems with indiscipline, drug use, ticket-punching officers and the soldiers that fragged them, and so forth, DID NOT YET EXIST.Most Vietnam War movies told the story of the latter parts of the war, when the public had turned against the war in general, and to a large extent against the military itself.  Drafting people into a war that was increasingly unpopular naturally lead to a decline in the fighting ability, discipline and morale of the military itself, with consequences that were sadly predictable.  This, however, was a different time, something that has to be understood as a historical fact when judging this film.With this in mind, We Were Soldiers was not idealizing the attitudes of the people involved in the battle; it was simply a snapshot in time of a hard-fought battle that started (in the American mind, anyway) a war that was not yet considered unjust, being fought by an Army that was still held in high regard by the public at large... and maybe more importantly, by itself.  In this context, it is clear why many criticisms of this film are rather stupid, to put it mildly.Thus, We Were Soldiers is quite historically accurate.  The soldiers were largely as they were portrayed in the film, and the battle largely unfolded as described in the movie.  The combat is depicted, rightly, as an awful and gruesome experience.  The behavior of the people involved is rather sentimental, but in truth soldiers who are bleeding to death tend to express simple sentiments, such as, ""tell my wife I love her,"" or ""tell my parents I done good.""  The supremely cynical sort may scoff at this, but they do so in the comfort of a sissified lifestyle, and thus have no basis to judge that sort of thing.  Those who read the book, instead of simply talking out of their behinds, will recognize that some of the most seemingly absurd events are, in fact, true.  That would, however, require INFORMED criticism, instead of simply speaking from simplistic prejudices.Having said all that, this film is not without its shortcomings.  It focuses excessive attention on the wives back at home, who ARE glorified to a rather silly degree.  Based on my experience in the military, a large proportion of the wives and girlfriends left behind were cheating on the deployed soldiers, or emptying out their bank accounts... a sad fact of life.  More significantly, I found these sequences to be rather boring, and served more as a distraction than as amplification.  The contrast with Black Hawk Down is significant.  In that film, director Ridley Scott did not give the audience a break at all; he simply showed the events largely as they unfolded in as direct and (accurately) brutal manner as possible.  I think it was a better, if less conventional, film for taking that course of action.As a side note, those calling Black Hawk Down jingoistic must be utterly insane.  It is in many ways the most anti-war movie you will see, simply because it does the best job of showing how awful the actual combat was, and how futile the battle turned out to be for everyone involved.  I think some people won't be satisfied with a movie about the U.S. Army unless it consists entirely of soldiers eating babies alive.For the grown-ups out there, for the most part this is realistic movie for the period it is supposed to represent, and covers a portion of the Vietnam War largely ignored by Hollywood.

705951,A18CRS4FLVH5YW,B000068TPN,"Star Sailor ""Worldwide Traveler""","[21, 65]","This movie is so thick with sugary, gooey and contrived sentiment you'll wish the dentist was sitting right next to you to clean your teeth when it's all over.  There is not one thing they ""got right"" with this movie.  When I see movies like Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Hamburger Hill, I am reminded of what great filmmaking involving the Vietnam War can be.  For an author to outright say Hollywood has never produced one film about the Vietnam War with ultimate correctness, I am appalled by the accusation since those last three films I just mentioned have gone on to be some of the most powerful and gripping films of our time-not to mention of the Vietnam War!  After watching ""We were soldiers,"" the directors and writers use every cliche in the book (including cliches innovated from those three films) to tell a story that has been told a million times before and with far better innovation than this tripe of a film!Let me say this without reservation;  I am in the US Navy and quite simply, watching something like this angers me because it tries too hard to convey a message without taking the really hard roads to tell it.  It's almost presented with too much ease and not enough grit and grime.  I will say, there is one scene where the grit and grime come really close-when Barry Peppers character tries to lift one of his buddies to safety only to accidently pull off charred legs from Nepalm-it's gripping and shocking and the look on Barry Peppers face is brilliant.  Barry Pepper is a really great actor and quite frankly he really holds up a really small and strong character throughout the film.  Unfortunately, I quickly ended up breaking in laughter watching bacon boy look ridiculous with all the obvious layers of make up that was supposed to look like a charred face.After watching the ""making of"" documentary on the DVD, my assumptions were correct when they show you a plethora of wardrobe for Mr. Gibson who wore dozens of different uniforms to show the wear and tear of the event.  C'MON!  Why not just have Mel Gibson in one uniform for the entire thing?  Do you see what Hollywood is trying to do here folks?  It's not reality and it's not realistic, it's just a bunch of guys in front of a camera playing war games only with a bunch of caterers standing by and slick and expensive production designl. Even worse, no heartfelt emotion anywhere!The DVD itself poses almost no extras (not even a trailer) and is a letdown considering this movie was a major upset and only raked in a measly 60 million at the box office.  This movie cost almost twice that and I don't see them really making up the cost anywhere on this DVD version.  I am kinda glad this movie didn't go too far.  It doesn't deserve to.  After watching brilliant war films like Saving Private Ryan (depicting WW2) and Black Hawk Down (Gulf War), you know that the story of Vietnam has been appropriately done somewhere else after watching ""We Were Soldiers.""",1,The first war movie that made me laugh hysterically!,1029974400,"08 22, 2002",2002,2956,"['movie', 'so', 'thick', 'sugary', 'gooey', 'contrived', 'sentiment', ""'ll"", 'wish', 'dentist', 'was', 'sitting', 'right', 'next', 'clean', 'teeth', 'when', 'over', 'not', 'one', 'thing', 'got', 'right', 'movie', 'When', 'see', 'movies', 'Platoon', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'Hamburger', 'Hill', 'am', 'reminded', 'what', 'great', 'filmmaking', 'involving', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'can', 'be', 'author', 'outright', 'say', 'Hollywood', 'never', 'produced', 'one', 'film', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'ultimate', 'correctness', 'am', 'appalled', 'accusation', 'last', 'three', 'films', 'just', 'mentioned', 'have', 'gone', 'be', 'most', 'powerful', 'gripping', 'films', 'time-not', 'mention', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'watching', 'were', 'soldiers', 'directors', 'writers', 'use', 'cliche', 'book', 'including', 'cliches', 'innovated', 'three', 'films', 'tell', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'million', 'times', 'far', 'better', 'innovation', 'tripe', 'film', 'Let', 'say', 'reservation', 'am', 'US', 'Navy', 'quite', 'simply', 'watching', 'something', 'angers', 'too', 'hard', 'convey', 'message', 'taking', 'really', 'hard', 'roads', 'tell', 'almost', 'presented', 'too', 'much', 'ease', 'not', 'enough', 'grit', 'grime', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'grit', 'grime', 'come', 'really', 'close-when', 'Barry', 'Peppers', 'character', 'tries', 'lift', 'one', 'buddies', 'safety', 'only', 'accidently', 'pull', 'off', 'charred', 'legs', 'Nepalm-it', 'gripping', 'shocking', 'look', 'Barry', 'Peppers', 'face', 'brilliant', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'really', 'great', 'actor', 'quite', 'frankly', 'really', 'up', 'really', 'small', 'strong', 'character', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'quickly', 'ended', 'up', 'breaking', 'laughter', 'watching', 'bacon', 'boy', 'look', 'ridiculous', 'obvious', 'layers', 'make', 'up', 'was', 'supposed', 'look', 'charred', 'face.After', 'watching', 'making', 'documentary', 'DVD', 'assumptions', 'were', 'correct', 'when', 'show', 'plethora', 'wardrobe', 'Mr.', 'Gibson', 'who', 'wore', 'dozens', 'different', 'uniforms', 'show', 'wear', 'tear', 'event', ""C'MON"", 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'have', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'one', 'uniform', 'entire', 'thing', 'Do', 'see', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'trying', 'do', 'here', 'folks', 'not', 'reality', 'not', 'realistic', 'just', 'bunch', 'guys', 'front', 'camera', 'playing', 'war', 'games', 'only', 'bunch', 'caterers', 'standing', 'slick', 'expensive', 'production', 'designl', 'Even', 'worse', 'heartfelt', 'emotion', 'anywhere', 'DVD', 'almost', 'extras', 'not', 'even', 'trailer', 'letdown', 'considering', 'movie', 'was', 'major', 'upset', 'only', 'raked', 'measly', '60', 'million', 'box', 'office', 'movie', 'cost', 'almost', 'twice', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'really', 'making', 'up', 'cost', 'anywhere', 'DVD', 'version', 'am', 'kinda', 'glad', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'far', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'watching', 'brilliant', 'war', 'films', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'depicting', 'WW2', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Gulf', 'War', 'know', 'story', 'Vietnam', 'been', 'appropriately', 'done', 'somewhere', 'else', 'watching', 'Were', 'Soldiers']",N/A

Just think about it.  You're put on a chopper and flown many miles behind enemy lines.  Then you're dropped in a field and told to hold it and wait for reinforcements, which will take about an hour.  You don't know if your position will be overrun and what's worse is you don't know how many enemies you're facing.  It could be 5 guys in a trench or 5,000 in underground tunnels.

This is one of the most realistic portrayals of warfare on a battlefield-level that I have seen in a while.Most of this movie is the brutal neverending Ia Drang Valley battle between American and Vietnamese forces. With bullets whizzing, soldiers screaming, and choppers flying overhead you feel as if the only thing missing is the smell of the gunpowder. However, when the movie switches to show the families back home and their lives, it is capable of exceptionally emotional and very touching moments. The transition between such scenes is very well done. You don't find yourself watching an adrenaline-pumping scene and suddenly switch over to a scene of a sobbing wife. Instead, it naturally takes you through the peaks and lulls of emotion and you never find yourself being taken off-guard.The end result is an excellent movie that has definite replay value.

As with most Mel Gibson films, he wants to grab his audience by the heart (Hamelt, Braveheart, etc.). He does his homework, and with the help of Randal Wallace, always pulls if off. It's a true story, of course dramatized, about the first official combat mission in Vietnam by the 7th Air Cav. Gibson portrays Lt. Col. Hal Moore (who is now a retired Army General). There are quite a few emotional moments, but the battlefield action prevents it from becoming the cross-over date flick like Braveheart. However, the sountract is stunning and soul-stirring; and the music from the end credits ""Mansions of the Lord"" was sung at President Reagan's funeral; how much more of an honor can you get?The only criticisms that I can give are trying to play a bit TOO much for the sympathy card, but after all, Gibson always gives you both barrels, so really can't be faulted.

And holds no punches.Braveheart, We Were Soldiers, Apocalypto, all are REAL life, and he films them true, emotional, and as bloody as the times they portray.All the details can be found on other reviews...the dates, the names. I only want to review the emotions of this movie, and its quality. Because it is the emotions of Vietnam, that we carry to this day.When I was 17, I had already had my first two induction `interviews'. I was 2 weeks from being inducted. I had scored 99% on the tests and was told I was going to be a 2nd Lt., which meant an immediate detail to the front line as cannon fodder. My neighbor, Steve Buck, came home from Vietnam after 4 years. He was there as an adviser, and he was a Seal. Steve was involved some of the very first Viet/American confrontations. His stories were of blood and horror, and of futility. He lived across the street from my family, and we heard his nightmare screams in the middle of the night. His nightmares were horrible. As a young man who abhorred war, I tried to ask him what awaited me. The talks were usually accompanied by his bursting into tears for the friends he lost. His answers were about the closeness of his fellow grunts, the BOND between soldiers, that they were closer than family, and the ideal that they lived together or died together, at least in the beginning. Later, it became just the desire to survive.This film shows the first confrontations. When the idealism of One Unit to live or die existed.;..when commanders were the father to the grunts. It also shows the men as fathers, especially Gibson's scenes with his family before he is sent to fight.Gibson shows that early war dedication as Lt Hal Moore, in charge of troops surrounded by the enemy (a la `The 300'). He is repeatedly told to abandon his troops, but refuses. Instead of the usual Pretty Boy role, Gibson is hard and gritty, as he was in Braveheart. It is Lt. Moore's dedication to his men that is the whole point of this film.Greg Kinnear shows his acting skills as the helicopter pilot who refuses to abandon the trapped squad. Anyone who doubts Kinnear can carry a role must see this film. The empathy he shows for the ground troops is almost overwhelming,The soundtrack is moving. the cinematography is exact, and the brutality is not skirted. The color is artfully washed during the battle scenes to show the darkness of battle and death. But at the same time, the blood is  scarlet to highlight the pain and horror.If you are into war movies, I advice this film, as well as `Saving Private Ryan', and `Full Metal Jacket'.

Great war story, poor movie.Gibson's performance as Moore is excellent, but most of the movie is the action that took place at Landing Zone X-Ray and the knoll in which several soldiers found themselves pinned down.  Except for some disgusting moments (skin slipping off of flesh, people being burned alive, etc.) aided by excellent visual effects, there really is nothing new here.  The gory action is surprisingly lackluster and routine, especially when compared to the sheer intensity of Saving Private Ryan and the brilliantly-photographed all out chaos of Black Hawk Down.Another complaint is the pointless scenes of the wives back home, which serve no purpose other than to try a jerk a few tears.  Portraying grieving wives in this type of war movie, which is basically about survival, is totally innapropriate.Of course there's the flagwaving and cliched talk amongst the troops which is fairly standard nowadays, and that detracts from the realism and brutality.  It's as if the director didn't know which movie to make: a shocking ground level view of combat or a Pearl Harbor-style teen flick.  Very uneven.If you want the ultimate war story about troops who are outnumbered, outgunned, and emerge victorious despite overwhelming odds, see Ridley Scott's 'Black Hawk Down.'  For a great all-around war movie, watch Spielberg's Private Ryan.

Im WE WERE SOLDIERS, there was way too much of guys giving eachother loving/caring looks and religious talk-I doubt in battle its a good idea to not stay down, the Sargent Major stood up the ENTIRE TIME!!!!!  and nobody shot him, WOW is that luck or just dumb Hollywood crap???In summary, it was a good battle scene and it spoke about families back home and death but I liked PLATOON and FULL METAL JACKET better when it comes to Veatnam War movies.",3,good.  not great,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,944,"['truly', 'felt', 'PLATOON', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'Im', 'sure', 'battles', 'where', 'just', 'what', 'saw', 'WE', 'WERE', 'SOLDIERS', 'other', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'example', '-the', 'reporter', 'guy', 'getting', 'battle', 'kept', 'talking', 'Major', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'think', 'Major', 'MORE', 'IMPORTANT', 'THINGS', 'TO', 'DO', '-the', 'reporter', 'guy', 'acted', 'was', 'expert', 'battles', 'battle', 'was', 'over', 'kinda', 'lame', '-In', 'PLATOON', 'was', ""n't"", 'religion', 'was', 'staying', 'alive', 'WE', 'WERE', 'SOLDIERS', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'guys', 'giving', 'eachother', 'loving/caring', 'looks', 'religious', 'talk-I', 'doubt', 'battle', 'good', 'idea', 'not', 'stay', 'down', 'Sargent', 'Major', 'stood', 'up', 'ENTIRE', 'TIME', 'nobody', 'shot', 'WOW', 'luck', 'just', 'dumb', 'Hollywood', 'crap', 'summary', 'was', 'good', 'battle', 'scene', 'spoke', 'families', 'back', 'home', 'death', 'liked', 'PLATOON', 'FULL', 'METAL', 'JACKET', 'better', 'when', 'Veatnam', 'War', 'movies']",N/A

The expressions of excited young men going off to war, is stunningly altered into those bearing great shock, sorrow, and death.  The women they left at home portray the qualities of 1965 ladies supportive of their husbands, no matter what.Madeline Stowe, as Lt. Col. Hal Moore's wife, unites the wives left behind on the base.  When the Army is unprepared to hand deliver telegrams informing the family that their soldier died, she takes over the task from the cab company that had been hired to do so.  Each telegram is poignant, and I was reminded that every soldier, nurse, doctor, civilian, everyone has a story.This one is about the American men who fought the first battle for God and country in Vietnam.  The film begins with a disclaimer that it is not a reflection of personal or political ideologies.  To me, that statement generally means the studio must distance itself to avoid potential ramifications about an unpopular war.  Also, that I am about to see more truth than fiction, more questions than answers.We Were Soldiers is intense, and I could only watch it in short segments.  I needed time to think, to understand, and to witness the horror of battle.  It is vivid -- when bullets hit bodies, blood spews from the wounds.  Friendly fire kills, and is only called friendly because the man behind the bullet or bomb is in the same army.  Napalm burns whomever is in the path, and flesh is charred to the bone.  These are graphically displayed, and accounts for the ""R"" rating at the box office.The reality, especially looking backwards at history and knowing these men and women came home without a hero's welcome, stirs me deeply.  Honor and integrity are shown along with ""battle scenes once seen that can never be forgotten"" in words such as ""I will be the first one on the field and the last one to leave, and I will leave no man behind.""Lt. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) said he would never forgive himself because his men died and he did not in the La Drang Valley (the Valley of Death).  It is clear that in the end, soldiers fought to save each other as they obeyed orders.We Were Soldiers, The Thin Red Line, Saving Private Ryan, Behind Enemy Lines, Blackhawk Down, Flight of the Intruder, Platoon, and so many others are very important films; they are about historical events.

Unlike a lot of recent war films, which try to digitize the battle, this film is mostly live action, if not all.""We Were Soldiers"" is different from a lot of Vietnam War movies in how it shows the soldiers on both sides. The Americans aren't pot-smoking hippies who don't want to be there. They are respectable, sane men who know that they have a duty and do it. As for the Vietnamese, it starts off bad in the beginning scene when their commander orders prisoners taken in battle executed. But the movie soon changes its tone, showing the human side of the enemy so that we sympathize with them. We even grieve when one of them dies. Some can say that these and other film depiction's differ because of the time; this movie takes place early in the war, before we really got dug in.One of my biggest complaints with ""Pearl Harbor"" was its overdoing of the romance plot, which drew attention away from the attack itself. ""WWS"" does have a romance subplot, involving the wives of the soldiers. But the producers don't overdo this. There are no love triangles, extra-martial affairs, one night stands or anything like that. The producers know that the war is the main plot and focus on that.I should mention a word on the acting. While no one in here could match Laurence Olivier while playing Shakespeare, they were all very good in their parts. I particularly liked Sam Elliott as Sergeant Major Plumley who gets some of the best lines. Particularly memorable are the two encounters he has with an officer that says ""Good Morning"" to him and Gibson's idea to the battalion about family. He tells them about how the warriors in Crazy Horse's tribe referred to all older women as mother and all older men as grandfather. Plumley doesn't particularly like that idea, as he bluntly points out to the troops.However, I have to show a balanced argument. The only compliant I had with this movie was the lack of time spent on the training of the soldiers as compared with say ""Full Metal Jacket"". But this barely tarnishes an otherwise a great movie.

705988,A1SZ2F37ATACUL,B000068TPN,"Whose Line? ""Kevin""","[3, 4]","I was soooo glad to see how well amazon viewers reviewed We Were Soldiers.  Many critics slammed the movie when it came out for being too flag-waving and unrealistic, as well as chastising Mel Gibson for being over-the-top in his role as Hal Moore.  What they failed to understand was that the battle actually happened, and Col Hal Moore served as a technical supervisor for the film.  In the special features he specifically states that their only concern was to ""get it right"".  As for being ""flag-waving"", I have yet to discern how that is a criticism of an American war movie.  We are shocked and horrified by the events depicted on screen, and the fact that they actually happened makes them even more awful, but this movie shows us the spirit of the ""American fighting man"" at its best.  Lastly, I cannot fault Mel Gibson for attempting to capture the full range of emotion of one of the finest battlefield commanders in American history.  I personally think he does a terrific job, as nobody does ""epic"" quite as well as Mel.Numerous Vietnam veterans have reviewed this film to testify to its realism and accuracy.  To me, that's all that needs to be said.

No, not the quality of the picture, but because of how real it makes war feel.War is a terrible tragedy, and what this film does is show you what happens when people in armchairs decide they want to fight. They send the boys to go play war and then wonder why they feel so sad when they have to write letters to all of their family members.This movie does not create any heroes, nor does it create any villains. Just like in real life. We may disagree with the views and opinions of another culture. But when they lay their guns down to rest and go home. They too are returning to wives, children, and families. And you see that in this film. You see who the Vietnamese soldiers care about, and you see who the American soldiers care about, and the films basically makes the two sides appear to be as one. Unfortunately, one side has to lose and there are many, many gruesome deaths in this movie.What this movie does well, in my opinion, is make you care about the characters. You care about what happens to these boys and their wives. You ask yourself ""was the war really necessary?"" when the battles get gruesome, you wonder how you would react if YOU were to be called to duty. At least I do, and it's heartbreaking. I've never served, but this movie makes me imagine what it could be like. And then after watching this movie you realize... this was just one battle. When it's time for war, these battles happen again and again doing its damndest to kill anyone you may care about.It also shows you the shame and devastating sadness, of the vietnam vets coming home and having no one to wait for them. No one to hug them and call them heroes.It's a sad movie, but it's well done and well worth your time to watch it.

We Were Soldiers uses some of those same effects/devices to tell a compelling Vietnam War story.For a basic plot summary, We Were Soldiers tells the story of one of the first Vietnam battles.  It follows the First Battalion, 7th Cavalry division through their training, deployment, and improbably ""victory"" (depending on your perspective) in that seminal battle.Strangely, this film doesn't stand out much on its own accord (it doesn't do anything all that original).  However, it does enough things right to make for a very enjoyable, emotional experience.Mel Gibson shines as the lead actor, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, whose primary goal is to bring ""his boys"" back to the mainland alive.  In fact, this is one of the best roles I've ever seen Gibson in, far better than the action-hero roles he often fancies himself in.  The other members of the battalion are also well-cast and peppered with great actors.However, this film is at its best when it tugs at your heartstrings, which it does frequently.  Whether it is the physical  @#!*%  of the soldiers in the field, or the mental  @#!*%  of their wives/families back home, this movie really ""gets"" the emotions of that time period.
