It was hilarious and so right on. I think what I saw was Creature Comforts America (Being released May 8, 2008 on DVD) because some of the characters were perfect American stereotypes.Anyway, I immediately ordered the first and second British season and started watching them last night. The other reviews here are right and about all I can add is that these are wonderful. The snail family with the baby singing had me rolling. The two old bats discussing how many husbands they had and how it wasn't proper to ask were hilarious. And the chickens admitting one had bought eggs to use in a county fair, well, these are just a few of the moments on these DVDs and I can't wait to see the full Creature Comforts America.The whole premise is brilliant - interview regular people and then put the voices to particular animals and then add sight gags and such and it becomes pure genius. These are quick moving in spite of some of the interviewees talking a bit slow and meandering as they just do stream of conscience commentary. The sight gags and staging fill in beautifully. You really need to pay attention or you miss things. These will definitely be a watch over and over item.I don't know who wouldn't like these. Even though a lot of the jokes are more adult humor, (but not vulgar - just that adults have the life experiences to relate) I think the sight gags will hold younger people's interest. And a lot of the commentary is universal so young and old ought to enjoy these.All in all, I recommend these very highly. It's perfect family entertainment too.",5,The Most Fun I've Had Watching TV In Quite A While,1210118400,"05 7, 2008",2008,1714,"[""'ve"", 'long', 'been', 'fan', 'Nick', 'Park', 'Aardman', 'had', 'not', 'heard', 'Creature', 'Comforts', 'happened', 'see', 'episode', 'last', 'week', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'was', 'hilarious', 'so', 'right', 'think', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'Creature', 'Comforts', 'America', 'Being', 'released', 'May', '8', '2008', 'DVD', 'characters', 'were', 'perfect', 'American', 'stereotypes.Anyway', 'immediately', 'ordered', 'first', 'second', 'British', 'season', 'started', 'watching', 'last', 'night', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'are', 'right', 'can', 'add', 'are', 'wonderful', 'snail', 'family', 'baby', 'singing', 'had', 'rolling', 'two', 'old', 'bats', 'discussing', 'how', 'many', 'husbands', 'had', 'how', 'was', ""n't"", 'proper', 'ask', 'were', 'hilarious', 'chickens', 'admitting', 'one', 'had', 'bought', 'eggs', 'use', 'county', 'fair', 'well', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'moments', 'DVDs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'full', 'Creature', 'America.The', 'whole', 'premise', 'brilliant', 'interview', 'regular', 'people', 'then', 'put', 'voices', 'particular', 'animals', 'then', 'add', 'sight', 'gags', 'such', 'pure', 'genius', 'are', 'quick', 'moving', 'spite', 'interviewees', 'talking', 'bit', 'slow', 'meandering', 'just', 'do', 'stream', 'conscience', 'commentary', 'sight', 'gags', 'staging', 'fill', 'beautifully', 'really', 'need', 'pay', 'attention', 'miss', 'things', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'watch', 'item.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'Even', 'lot', 'jokes', 'are', 'more', 'adult', 'humor', 'not', 'vulgar', 'just', 'adults', 'have', 'life', 'experiences', 'relate', 'think', 'sight', 'gags', 'will', 'hold', 'younger', 'people', 'interest', 'lot', 'commentary', 'universal', 'so', 'young', 'old', 'ought', 'enjoy', 'these.All', 'recommend', 'very', 'highly', 'perfect', 'family', 'entertainment', 'too']",N/A
1014985,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B000HIVJ28,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[21, 23]","I've been a fan of these ""Claymation"" animated presentations since 1990 when the feature movie called  ""Creature Comfort"" won the Academy Award' in it's category.  The ""brains' behind that feature have gone on to do a television series, by the same name (except now the title is plural), of which this two DVD presentation is seasons one and two that contains a host of ""new"" characters.  The creators of ""Creature Comforts"" the series continue the most hilarious tradition that they started with the original feature movie.  My god, these series are so darn funny.  I feel that it is indeed ""cartoons"" for ""Grown ups""as were many of the ""Looney Tunes"" cartoons.  Kids, of course, can enjoy them too; however, to me, it takes some real ""life experience"" to fully appreciate the humor therein because it, for the most part, is rather subtle.This series posses questions that most of us face every day to hilariously animated animals that are made of clay. These clay cartoon characters answer these questions (some rather serious ones) using (of course, supplied by wonderful actors) accents (British, American, Spanish, etc.) .that are hysterical.  In addition, to these question and answer sketches there is usually something very funny going on in the background.  Therefore, one gets more and more out of each sketch upon multiple viewings.  Some of the questions posed and answered couldn't be with human subjects because some sketches do border on the ""politically incorrect"".Above all these series are extremely funny.
