1011906,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B000HC2LJE,Chris Kennison,"[6, 11]","MINI's FIRST TIME is about a high school senior, played by a dangerously attractive Nikki Reed, who is by no means, exploring with sex or a virgin, as the title may suggest. In fact, she's way ahead of herself, seducing older men and even taking a job as a call girl as a rebellion against her drug-induced and unattentive mother, played by Carrie Anne-Moss.Her first job, sends her straight to the hotel room with her unsuspecting stepfather, Alec Baldwin. She turns out the lights and proceeds with her job, doing it with her step-father, and setting the course for the movie and the vindictive, diabolical nature of Mini.Ultimately, MINI's FIRST TIME is a decent film. Yet, it's nothing that you will remember a few days after watching it. The most noteable thing about MINI's FIRST TIME in my book, was the performance of CARRIE-ANNE MOSS. Her embodiment of the mother who hasn't let go of her partying side, or bringing home of strange men and her slide into madness as MINI toys with her mind, is outstanding.MINI'S FIRST TIME goes wrong because the whole movie is centered around MINI's ability to seduce and influence older wealthy men. Ultimately, the movie should seduce you, the viewer, into her web, and bring you into the same clouded mindset as the people she's manipulating. It fails miserably. First of all, it shows you everything she's doing. There's no confusion or mystery. There's absolutely ZERO craftiness to the storytelling.More importantly, the movie isn't sexy at all. MINI seduces her stepfather Martin and her neighbor Mike (Jeff Goldblum), but fails to seduce the audience. Like I said, Nikki Reed is a beautiful girl, but I found the movie way too tame and didn't once feel entranced. The audience should feel the same guilt as the characters involved. We should feel ourselves facing the same morale dilemmas, knowing that she's a little devil, but still knowing that we couldn't resist her.I didn't once. Too tame. If they'd have pushed more buttons, MINI's FIRST TIME, may have been a movie that would have been tough to forget, but instead, it's already forgotten.",3,MINI fails to SEDUCE,1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,2099,"['MINI', 'FIRST', 'TIME', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'played', 'dangerously', 'attractive', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'who', 'means', 'exploring', 'sex', 'virgin', 'title', 'may', 'suggest', 'fact', 'way', 'ahead', 'seducing', 'older', 'men', 'even', 'taking', 'job', 'call', 'girl', 'rebellion', 'drug-induced', 'unattentive', 'mother', 'played', 'Carrie', 'Anne-Moss.Her', 'first', 'job', 'straight', 'hotel', 'room', 'unsuspecting', 'stepfather', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'out', 'lights', 'proceeds', 'job', 'doing', 'step-father', 'setting', 'course', 'movie', 'vindictive', 'diabolical', 'nature', 'Mini.Ultimately', 'MINI', 'FIRST', 'TIME', 'decent', 'film', 'nothing', 'will', 'remember', 'few', 'days', 'watching', 'most', 'noteable', 'thing', 'MINI', 'FIRST', 'TIME', 'book', 'was', 'performance', 'CARRIE-ANNE', 'MOSS', 'embodiment', 'mother', 'who', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'partying', 'side', 'bringing', 'home', 'strange', 'men', 'slide', 'madness', 'MINI', 'mind', 'FIRST', 'TIME', 'wrong', 'whole', 'movie', 'centered', 'MINI', 'ability', 'seduce', 'influence', 'older', 'wealthy', 'men', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'should', 'seduce', 'viewer', 'web', 'bring', 'same', 'clouded', 'mindset', 'people', 'manipulating', 'miserably', 'First', 'all', 'everything', 'doing', 'confusion', 'mystery', 'absolutely', 'ZERO', 'craftiness', 'storytelling.More', 'importantly', 'movie', ""n't"", 'sexy', 'MINI', 'stepfather', 'Martin', 'neighbor', 'Mike', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'seduce', 'audience', 'said', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'found', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'tame', 'did', ""n't"", 'once', 'feel', 'entranced', 'audience', 'should', 'feel', 'same', 'guilt', 'characters', 'involved', 'should', 'feel', 'ourselves', 'facing', 'same', 'morale', 'dilemmas', 'knowing', 'little', 'devil', 'still', 'knowing', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'her.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'once', 'Too', 'tame', ""'d"", 'have', 'pushed', 'more', 'buttons', 'MINI', 'FIRST', 'TIME', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tough', 'forget', 'instead', 'already', 'forgotten']",N/A

This flashy flick had a movie of the week quality that suited its waaaay over the top far-fetched storyline about a spoiled teenaged LA call girl who, though already rich and pampered, does whom it takes to get what she wants. Starring just about every celebrity in Hollywood, or at least giving the feeling that it did (we're talking Nikki Reed, Carrie-Anne Moss, Luke Wilson, Jeff Goldblum, Alec Baldwin, Nana Visitor and more)  this campy tale of a scheming, hot-blooded nymphette's plot to get rid of her unstable never-was mother, an aging actress wanna-be, and hook up with her momentarily more useful stepfather, played by Alec Baldwin, comes off like Nabokov writing for a trashy tabloid.

1011909,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000HC2LJE,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[9, 11]","""Mini's First Time"" was in theatres for about ten minutes before quietly sneaking onto DVD. I had heard of the movie long before it slipped into theatres and didn't know it had been released on DVD until a couple weeks later. When I first heard the title, I thought it was a shameless way of getting people to see it. The title actually makes a lot of sense, so I'm going to tell you right now that movie has no nudity in it. It stars Nikki Reed, who co-starred in and co-wrote Thirteen. That movie scored Holly Hunter an Oscar nomination, jumpstarted Evan Rachel Wood's career, but Reed has just kind of chilled in the background; Appearing in movies like Lords of Dogtown and American Gun recently. The role she's playing here can be compared to the Barbara Stanwyck character in ""Double Indemnity"" and the Kathleen Turner character in ""Body Heat."" In fact, it could also be compared to Reed's own character from ""Thirteen."" In the end, it's like one big combination of them all. Reed plays Mini, the daughter of Diane (Carrie-Anne Moss, 'Memento') a Hollywood golddigger and wannabe actress who never made it after she was impregnated by a producer. Mini is in high school (but is apparently 18, since she's on the verge of graduating and smokes in front of cops and things like that) and obsessed with doing things for the first time. Sex, blackmail, murder, whatever. Her mother is married to a man named Martin (Alec Baldwin), who is unhappy with his marriage. He's a public relations guy, which Mini finds ironic since he's never in public with her mother and she doesn't remember the last time they had relations. After getting a (temporary) job as an escort girl, she finds herself in a room with Martin. Suddenly, they begin having an affair but realize that they need to get Mini's mother out of the picture. That's easier said than done. Mini suggests murder, but that's too risky; So, Mini begins stealing pills from school and putting them in her mothers drinks, hoping that they can eventually get someone to put her mother away. When her mother attempts to commit suicide by taking too many sleeping pills (although it doesn't kill her, but merely knocks her unconscious), Mini and Martin decide to put her inside her car and have her killed from toxic fumes. It seems logical. She takes the pills, so she'll be asleep when she dies. This should work out perfect, if not for a suspicious detective (Luke Wilson) and a nosy TV show-producer neighbor (Jeff Goldblum). The movie isn't your typical dumb teenager movie though. In fact, this movie will probably appeal more to adults than to kids. As I said though, it's kind of like Thirteen+Double Indemnity=Mini's First Time. It's well written, funny, and all the performances are believable. Nikki Reed plays a pretty good femme fatale. It is predictable, but it's entertaining enough to make you forget that. Alec Baldwin is also very good as the man who finds himself so controlled by this woman (girl) that he'll do anything for her. It, at least, seems believable most of the time. I'm giving it 5 stars, because I liked it a lot. It's actually more suited for four stars and most people will agree with that; but it's a movie that is actually worth checking out.GRADE: A-SHOULD BE: B",5,Double Indemnity+Thirteen=Mini's First Time,1163203200,"11 11, 2006",2006,3253,"['Mini', 'First', 'Time', 'was', 'theatres', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'quietly', 'sneaking', 'DVD', 'had', 'heard', 'movie', 'long', 'slipped', 'theatres', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'couple', 'weeks', 'later', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'title', 'thought', 'was', 'shameless', 'way', 'getting', 'people', 'see', 'title', 'actually', 'lot', 'sense', ""'m"", 'going', 'tell', 'right', 'now', 'movie', 'nudity', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'who', 'co-starred', 'co-wrote', 'Thirteen', 'movie', 'scored', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'jumpstarted', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'career', 'Reed', 'just', 'kind', 'chilled', 'background', 'Appearing', 'movies', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'American', 'Gun', 'recently', 'role', 'playing', 'here', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'character', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'character', 'Body', 'Heat', 'fact', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'compared', 'Reed', 'own', 'character', 'Thirteen', 'end', 'one', 'big', 'combination', 'Reed', 'Mini', 'daughter', 'Diane', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', ""'Memento"", 'Hollywood', 'golddigger', 'wannabe', 'actress', 'who', 'never', 'made', 'was', 'impregnated', 'producer', 'Mini', 'high', 'school', 'apparently', '18', 'verge', 'graduating', 'smokes', 'front', 'cops', 'things', 'obsessed', 'doing', 'things', 'first', 'time', 'Sex', 'blackmail', 'murder', 'mother', 'married', 'man', 'named', 'Martin', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'public', 'relations', 'guy', 'Mini', 'ironic', 'never', 'public', 'mother', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'had', 'relations', 'getting', 'temporary', 'job', 'escort', 'girl', 'room', 'Martin', 'Suddenly', 'begin', 'having', 'affair', 'realize', 'need', 'get', 'Mini', 'mother', 'picture', 'easier', 'said', 'done', 'Mini', 'murder', 'too', 'risky', 'So', 'Mini', 'stealing', 'pills', 'school', 'putting', 'mothers', 'drinks', 'hoping', 'can', 'eventually', 'get', 'someone', 'put', 'mother', 'away', 'When', 'mother', 'attempts', 'commit', 'suicide', 'taking', 'too', 'many', 'sleeping', 'pills', ""n't"", 'kill', 'merely', 'unconscious', 'Mini', 'Martin', 'decide', 'put', 'car', 'have', 'killed', 'toxic', 'fumes', 'logical', 'pills', ""'ll"", 'be', 'asleep', 'when', 'should', 'work', 'out', 'perfect', 'not', 'suspicious', 'detective', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'nosy', 'TV', 'show-producer', 'neighbor', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'movie', ""n't"", 'typical', 'dumb', 'teenager', 'movie', 'fact', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'appeal', 'more', 'adults', 'kids', 'said', 'kind', 'Thirteen+Double', 'Indemnity=Mini', 'First', 'Time', 'well', 'written', 'funny', 'performances', 'are', 'believable', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'pretty', 'good', 'femme', 'fatale', 'predictable', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'make', 'forget', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'controlled', 'woman', 'girl', ""'ll"", 'do', 'anything', 'least', 'believable', 'most', 'time', ""'m"", 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'liked', 'lot', 'actually', 'more', 'suited', 'four', 'stars', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'agree', 'movie', 'actually', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.GRADE', 'A-SHOULD', 'BE', 'B']",N/A

Swanson,"[2, 4]","4 stars mainly for the superlative start; 3 stars thereafterHoo boy, the first ten minutes are supersonic, the next twenty excellent, and then it quickly devolves into a standard crime flick. But still, the opening is a doozy...If you like a good cinematic rush, don't read any other reviews or the synopsis on the box, etc, and just enjoy the first third of this twisted little flick. The opening titles are quite ingenious, and herald an exposition that is razor sharp, brutally funny, and truly five-star in most every way. It's way un-pc, but feels like authentic Malibu phoniness, with all that implies. Affairs, alcoholism, drugs, etc, and kids who are far too clever for their own good.Nikki Reed comes on strong and doesn't let up; only the script lets her down, as the deliciously wicked comedy of the first third suddenly disappears and we are stuck with the predictable twists of a modern noir that is lacking the crackling dialogue and pace of the opening.Still, a great first film from Guthe, another winner from Baldwin (this performance feels a little edgy in light of this year's all-too-public family squabbles), a surprisingly funny Carrie-Anne Moss (What would Neo say?), and above all one helluva star turn from the underage but far too mature Nikki Reed. Watch this gal; she'll get there if the hollywood demons don't chew her up first. She may be too smart for them, but you never know...If this had kept up its early pace, it would be a true classic. Luke Wilson's nothing-ventured-and-less-gained performance highlights the failngs of the last half of the film. It gets boring; when you start this good, you gotta follow through!Nonetheless, the opening indicates that Guthe may yet turn in a truly great film, and his script has moments of genius at moments.Worth seeing for the first 30 hell-bent minutes.",4,"Can't keep it up, but moments of brilliance",1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,1831,"['4', 'stars', 'mainly', 'superlative', 'start', '3', 'stars', 'thereafterHoo', 'boy', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'are', 'supersonic', 'next', 'twenty', 'excellent', 'then', 'quickly', 'standard', 'crime', 'flick', 'still', 'opening', 'doozy', 'like', 'good', 'cinematic', 'rush', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'synopsis', 'box', 'etc', 'just', 'enjoy', 'first', 'third', 'twisted', 'little', 'flick', 'opening', 'titles', 'are', 'quite', 'ingenious', 'herald', 'exposition', 'razor', 'sharp', 'brutally', 'funny', 'truly', 'five-star', 'most', 'way', 'way', 'un-pc', 'feels', 'authentic', 'Malibu', 'phoniness', 'implies', 'Affairs', 'alcoholism', 'drugs', 'etc', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'clever', 'own', 'good.Nikki', 'Reed', 'strong', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'only', 'script', 'down', 'deliciously', 'wicked', 'comedy', 'first', 'third', 'suddenly', 'are', 'stuck', 'predictable', 'twists', 'modern', 'noir', 'lacking', 'crackling', 'dialogue', 'pace', 'opening.Still', 'great', 'first', 'film', 'Guthe', 'winner', 'Baldwin', 'performance', 'little', 'edgy', 'light', 'year', 'all-too-public', 'family', 'squabbles', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'What', 'would', 'Neo', 'say', 'one', 'helluva', 'star', 'turn', 'underage', 'far', 'too', 'mature', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'Watch', 'gal', ""'ll"", 'get', 'there', 'hollywood', 'demons', 'do', ""n't"", 'chew', 'up', 'first', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'smart', 'never', 'know', 'had', 'kept', 'up', 'early', 'pace', 'would', 'be', 'true', 'classic', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'nothing-ventured-and-less-gained', 'performance', 'highlights', 'failngs', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'boring', 'when', 'start', 'good', 'got', 'ta', 'follow', 'Nonetheless', 'opening', 'Guthe', 'may', 'yet', 'turn', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'script', 'moments', 'genius', 'moments.Worth', 'seeing', 'first', '30', 'hell-bent', 'minutes']",N/A

There were a few things about the movie that didn't make sense to me, such as why they were planning on pursuing a ""relationship"" instead of just leaving it at a casual fling. So because they want a relationship, they come up with ways to get rid of her mother. The whole thing could have been avoided if they had just understood the fact that it was just a little affair and she was eventually going to move out and move on. Going through all the trouble of drugging her mother seemed unrealistic to me.
