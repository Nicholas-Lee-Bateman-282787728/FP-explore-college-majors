Exactly the kind of movie suitable for the child in the age range 4-9. Real life wrestler Hulk Hogan plays a retired wrestler (Sean Armstrong) that apparently now spends his time fishing. His down-and-out former manager, played by Sherman Hemsley, hunts him down and offers Hogan a job as a bodyguard for the two children of a computer chip manufacturer. Their father has invented a new computer chip and the villain is trying to steal it and regularly calls to make threats.The two children are a brother and sister that are sheer terrors on nannies.  When Armstrong arrives to start his duties, their current nanny runs out of the house screaming with her hair on fire. The situation immediately becomes a test of wills as the children do all that they can to try to get Armstrong to quit. Most of the actions are over-the-top, yet Armstrong is finally able to earn their respect.There is an impersonator of Arnold Swarzenegger among the gang of villains and his presence adds a bit of humor and even more silliness. After a few scenes right out of the professional wrestling arena, Armstrong is able to defeat the villains and save the day.While many adults will find the movie a bit insufferable, children will love it; they will fantasize about doing what the children do to Armstrong, yet will appreciate what he eventually means to them.",4,"Predictable and silly, yet good for children",1377820800,"08 30, 2013",2013,1442,"['plot', 'movie', 'predictable', 'silly', 'more', 'bit', 'corny', 'dialog', 'often', 'weak', 'Exactly', 'kind', 'movie', 'suitable', 'child', 'age', 'range', '4-9', 'Real', 'life', 'wrestler', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'retired', 'wrestler', 'Sean', 'Armstrong', 'apparently', 'now', 'time', 'fishing', 'down-and-out', 'former', 'manager', 'played', 'Sherman', 'Hemsley', 'down', 'Hogan', 'job', 'bodyguard', 'two', 'children', 'computer', 'chip', 'manufacturer', 'father', 'invented', 'new', 'computer', 'chip', 'villain', 'trying', 'steal', 'regularly', 'make', 'threats.The', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'brother', 'sister', 'are', 'sheer', 'terrors', 'nannies', 'When', 'Armstrong', 'start', 'duties', 'current', 'nanny', 'house', 'screaming', 'hair', 'fire', 'situation', 'immediately', 'test', 'wills', 'children', 'do', 'can', 'try', 'get', 'Armstrong', 'quit', 'Most', 'actions', 'are', 'over-the-top', 'yet', 'Armstrong', 'finally', 'able', 'earn', 'respect.There', 'impersonator', 'Arnold', 'Swarzenegger', 'gang', 'villains', 'presence', 'bit', 'humor', 'even', 'more', 'silliness', 'few', 'scenes', 'right', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'arena', 'Armstrong', 'able', 'defeat', 'villains', 'save', 'day.While', 'many', 'adults', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'bit', 'insufferable', 'children', 'will', 'love', 'will', 'fantasize', 'doing', 'what', 'children', 'do', 'Armstrong', 'yet', 'will', 'appreciate', 'what', 'eventually']",Mr Nanny VHS

And for the elementary school kid there is no better fantasy than a dream of revenge against the babysitter. For its target audience, there is no disappointment here. Hulk is the retired grappler turned unwilling nanny for spoiled but lovable kids and quickly falls foil to their tricks and traps. Then, of course, they are kidnapped by the evil and campy Buster Poindexter (who is just divine as a criminal with a steel plated cranium) and only the big man can save the day. Radio host and author Mother Love steals the scenes she has as the maid who tolerates Hulk. Some interesting side notes to this film are as follows: the lair of Poindexter which contains a torturous &quot;poison pool&quot; was shot on the same soundstage as the original &quot;Flipper&quot; series in Miami and the floor was rolled back for the first time in years to accommodate the production. Not used to the opening in the floor, the crew members continually fell into the water during shooting. The part of the first nanny who exits the house screaming with her hair on fire is played by the assistant production coordinator who was the only person available and willing to get lit up at the time. The soundstage and offices were so busy due to the heavy production schedule that the production office actually occupied a small extra stage and the black and white opening of the film, which is a wrestling dream sequence had to be shot inside the same space, requiring the office staff to move all desks, phones, copiers and fax machines to the edges of the room and work quietly during filming. Look for wrestling legend George &quot;The Animal&quot; Steele (also in &quot;Ed Wood&quot;) in the same scene, emoting the famous dialogue &quot;Hey. You. Nice.&quot;",3,"Kids Get The Babysitter, Mother Love Never Fails",998092800,"08 18, 2001",2001,1775,"[""C'mon"", 'now', 'kid', 'movie', 'elementary', 'school', 'kid', 'better', 'fantasy', 'dream', 'revenge', 'babysitter', 'target', 'audience', 'disappointment', 'here', 'Hulk', 'retired', 'grappler', 'turned', 'unwilling', 'nanny', 'spoiled', 'lovable', 'kids', 'quickly', 'foil', 'tricks', 'traps', 'Then', 'course', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'evil', 'campy', 'Buster', 'Poindexter', 'who', 'just', 'divine', 'criminal', 'steel', 'plated', 'cranium', 'only', 'big', 'man', 'can', 'save', 'day', 'Radio', 'host', 'author', 'Mother', 'Love', 'scenes', 'maid', 'who', 'Hulk', 'interesting', 'side', 'notes', 'film', 'are', 'lair', 'Poindexter', 'torturous', 'quot', 'poison', 'pool', 'quot', 'was', 'shot', 'same', 'soundstage', 'original', 'quot', 'Flipper', 'quot', 'series', 'Miami', 'floor', 'was', 'rolled', 'back', 'first', 'time', 'years', 'accommodate', 'production', 'Not', 'used', 'opening', 'floor', 'crew', 'members', 'continually', 'fell', 'water', 'shooting', 'part', 'first', 'nanny', 'who', 'house', 'screaming', 'hair', 'fire', 'played', 'assistant', 'production', 'coordinator', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'available', 'willing', 'get', 'lit', 'up', 'time', 'soundstage', 'offices', 'were', 'so', 'busy', 'due', 'heavy', 'production', 'schedule', 'production', 'office', 'actually', 'occupied', 'small', 'extra', 'stage', 'black', 'white', 'opening', 'film', 'wrestling', 'dream', 'sequence', 'had', 'be', 'shot', 'same', 'space', 'requiring', 'office', 'staff', 'move', 'desks', 'phones', 'copiers', 'fax', 'machines', 'edges', 'room', 'work', 'quietly', 'filming', 'Look', 'wrestling', 'legend', 'George', 'quot', 'Animal', 'quot', 'Steele', 'also', 'quot', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'quot', 'same', 'scene', 'emoting', 'famous', 'dialogue', 'quot', 'Hey', 'Nice.', 'quot']",Mr Nanny VHS

392918,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,6303962440,"John ""MovieAddict""","[4, 7]","Sometimes you expect a certain something from a film. You expect it to just be good. At least. But the first impression when you hear of &quot;Mr. Nanny&quot; is instant nausea. Now, you might not know why this produces nausea until I lay down the plot for you. Think of image no. 1: Hulk Hogan as a babysitter wearing a tutu. While I freely admit that it doesn't sound promising, it's nevertheless astounding that the production team was able to take this simple idea and create one of the most monstrously agonizing motion pictures to come along this year. Now, here is image no. 2: Hulk Hogan giving a small child weapons training. Image no. 3: The child electrifying the school bully with his newfound weapons interest. Image no. 4: Hogan and Kid celebrating because Kid has electrocuted Bully in an awful manner.What we have here is good material for a spoof. How funny would it be to see an eight-year-old electrocute his bully in a Farrelly Brothers movie? But it's not a spoof. The problem is that in &quot;Mr. Nanny&quot; it is not played as a spoof, but as the real thing. The kid supposedly electrocutes his school bully (for real), and we are supposed to feel happy because he has beaten the bully at his own game. That has to be the most sappy excuse for an emotional rush I've ever heard. I don't feel like celebrating with this kid, but rather arresting Hogan and ordering a restraining order on him.Hulk Hogan plays down-on-his-luck ex-wrestler Sean Armstrong (get it, &quot;Armstrong&quot;?). He has long since exited the ring because of recurring nightmares involving violence in the ring. To give Sean something to do, his best buddy and manager, Barney (Sherman Hemsley), gets him a job as a bodyguard for computer genius Alex Mason (Austin Pendleton). Mason has invented a new super chip and a psycho is out to get it, so the engineer needs someone to look after his two motherless children (played by Raymond O'Connor and Madeline Zima). Reluctantly, Sean agrees, but only because they already have a nanny and his job will be strictly protection. No sooner has he arrived, however, than the nanny quits and Armstrong finds himself babysitting two demons.A film like &quot;Mr. Nanny&quot; is intellectually insulting on all levels. You have to wonder what the producers and filmmakers were thinking when they gave the &quot;OK&quot; to this film. It doesn't have a plot. It doesn't have good acting. It doesn't even have a half-decent script. The only reason for this film, apparently, is so that Hulk Hogan could be shown in a ballet tutu.Hulk Hogan can't act. His best performance was his three-liner in &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch.&quot; So you can imagine how awful it is when the testosterone-junkie with the deep voice fills up the majority of screen-time in the film, and tries to teach a father the values of family interaction and why it's good to tell your kids you love them. Perhaps this would be good material for, say, a muscle-man that can act, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, but &quot;the Hulk&quot; can't act half as good as Mr. Schwarzenegger, and most likely never will be able to.Most of the apparent laughs in this film come at the expense of Hogan, and at the expense of every film it has borrowed from. It's a bunch of recycled gags posing as new ones. But it might as well be said that I expected it.To name some of the recycled gags, here they are: He's hit on the head with bowling balls (see &quot;Uncle Buck&quot;), drenched with water (see &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;), covered in flour (see &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; a second time), and electrocuted (see &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;). Not one of these instances is funny, and it isn't because we've seen it so many times before. And another thing that doesn't help this film at all is the inept direction of Michael Gottlieb. Such comedy, while once amusing in Home Alone, has long since worn out its welcome. Here, it's handled in such a pedestrian manner that it comes across with the audible clunk of a standup comic's joke falling flat. Don't see this movie, whatever you do. If you see it glaring at you in the video store with Hulk Hogan's god-awful smirk on his face, pass it up. Even if it looks like clean family entertainment. It is far from it. It is PG-13 material packaged in a sweet little box. It's not a film. It's merchandising, plain and simple.There used to be a time when wrestling and Hulk Hogan where what Tony Hawk and skateboarding are today to children. Anything with Hawk sells and, at one time, anything with Hogan sold. Film execs knew this, and played to it. And that's all &quot;Mr. Nanny&quot; is: Marketing, plain and simple. Don't give any more money to these selfish corporations. They can live with what they did. &quot;Mr. Nanny&quot; was a spur-of-the-moment film made for cash-purposes. I'm surprised that all copies weren't burned after Hogan withered away into the recesses of &quot;has-been,&quot; because this film stands out as a single merchandising attempt, and its time has long since passed.",1,No Comment ;),1054512000,"06 2, 2003",2003,5062,"['Sometimes', 'expect', 'certain', 'something', 'film', 'expect', 'just', 'be', 'good', 'least', 'first', 'impression', 'when',

It tries to cash in on stuff that was popular back in the early-mid 1990's:Home Alone slapstick,top secert plot devices,family life lessons & big tough doing silly/goofy things but failed.

Amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product, for which this review may not apply.  After reading this review, please click on the link so that you can be assured that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for.--------------------------------------------------Normally when Warner Bros., which owns New Line, puts out a Double/Triple/Quadruple Feature of previously-released material, they simple use the disc images from those previously-released DVDs to make new dual-sided DVDs.  For an example of this, look at any of their ""Four Film Favorites"" titles, or even the2009 single-disc re-release of Miss Congeniality 1 & 2.  I figured that would be the case with this double feature, but I was wrong.Instead of containing copies of the two previously-released DVDs, this single-sided, dual-layer DVD contains both movies and nothing else.  To make matters worse, the two films are presented in 4:3 Fullscreen ONLY!  The individual DVDs ofMr. NannyandSuburban Commandocontain both 16:9 Anamorphic Widescreen & 4:3 Fullscreen (open matte) versions of each movie, along with each movie's Theatrical Trailer.  A useless ""Pick That Flick"" photo game, and an even more useless DVD-ROM menu that only takes you to New Line's now-defunct ""Hotspot"" website, are also included on those individual DVDs.There is absolutely no reason to pick up this Family Double Feature.  If you like both movies, buy the individual DVDs instead.",1,"4:3 Fullscreen Only, No Bonus Features - Get The Individual DVDs Instead!",1313625600,"08 18, 2011",2011,1575,"['Below', 'review', 'product', 'Mr.', 'Nanny/Suburban', 'Commando', 'Family', 'Double', 'Feature', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'may', 'display', 'review', 'page', 'version', 'product', 'review', 'may', 'not', 'apply', 'reading', 'review', 'please', 'click', 'link', 'can', 'be', 'assured', 'product', 'review', 'same', 'one', 'thought', 'was', 'for.', 'Normally', 'when', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'New', 'Line', 'out', 'Double/Triple/Quadruple', 'Feature', 'previously-released', 'material', 'simple', 'use', 'disc', 'images', 'previously-released', 'DVDs', 'make', 'new', 'dual-sided', 'DVDs', 'example', 'look', 'Four', 'Film', 'Favorites', 'titles', 'even', 'the2009', 'single-disc', 're-release', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', '1', '2', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'case', 'double', 'feature', 'was', 'wrong.Instead', 'containing', 'copies', 'two', 'previously-released', 'DVDs', 'single-sided', 'dual-layer', 'DVD', 'movies', 'nothing', 'else', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'presented', '4:3', 'Fullscreen', 'ONLY', 'individual', 'DVDs', 'ofMr', 'NannyandSuburban', 'Commandocontain', '16:9', 'Anamorphic', 'Widescreen', '4:3', 'Fullscreen', 'open', 'matte', 'versions', 'movie', 'movie', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'A', 'useless', 'Pick', 'Flick', 'photo', 'game', 'even', 'more', 'useless', 'DVD-ROM', 'menu', 'only', 'New', 'Line', 'now-defunct', 'Hotspot', 'website', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'individual', 'DVDs.There', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'pick', 'up', 'Family', 'Double', 'Feature', 'like', 'movies', 'buy', 'individual', 'DVDs', 'instead']",Mr Nanny VHS
