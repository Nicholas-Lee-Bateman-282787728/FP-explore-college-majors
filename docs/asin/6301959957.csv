About the ONLY thing accurate about it is that they depicted the bombers as B-17F's which is the model of the Memphis Belle.  There were a few good flying scenes and some memorable scenes of the inside of a B-17; otherwise, the story has been altered by Hollywood for its own purposes.  They didn't use the real names of any of the Belle's crew (unforgivable IMO), and not even the Belle's nose art was correct (it was dolled up considerably from the real thing).  Anyone interested in the REAL Memphis Belle should see William Wyler's outstanding documentary, or read Belle pilot Bob Morgan's excellent book, ""The Man Who Flew The Memphis Belle"".

274469,A1A87TUBBDPMF0,6301959957,"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer""","[5, 5]","Memphis Belle, Michael Caton-Jones' fictionalized 1990 account of a real-life World War II B-17's final mission, harkens back to wartime morale-boosting films.  Like Wake Island or Air Force, it depicts the crew of a Flying Fortress taking part in the bloody aerial campaign over Western Europe - and trying to survive the last of a 25-mission tour of duty.Produced by Catherine Wyler, whose father William had shot a documentary about the real Memphis Belle, this version takes familiar clich&eacute;s from World War II films and fleshes them out with fresh Hollywood faces.  Matthew Modine, Eric Stoltz, Sean Astin (best known now as Samwise in the Lord of the Rings trilogy), Reed Diamond, and Harry Connick, Jr. are among the ten actors who portray the fictional crew of the Memphis Belle.Released during the buildup to Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm, this very retro movie failed to excite audiences, but even so, Memphis Belle is impressive once it gets off the ground and dispenses with expository material.Set in England in May of 1943, the story starts somewhat slowly as an Army Air Force PR officer (John Lithgow) annoyingly prepares the crew and squadron for the Memphis Belle's return to the States.  The bomber has completed 24 missions over Nazi-occupied Europe.  Now the only thing standing between the war-weary flyboys and home is one last mission over Bremen.  There are the usual war movie get-to-know the crew scenes and even a quick (but not graphic) sexual encounter between one of the lads and a British lass...ho hum.But when dawn comes and the bombers are sent to bomb a German fighter-aircraft factory, Memphis Belle draws the audience into the harrowing yet mesmerizing drama of a daylight bombing raid over Germany.  Here there are no Stealth fighters with laser-guided smart bombs flying with relative ease over the enemy.  Instead, we are treated to almost every danger faced by bomber crews in World War II - mid air collisions, flak, enemy fighters, and even a case of friendly fire.  Naturally, most of the havoc inflicted on the B-17s falls on the Memphis Belle, which in real life was not damaged as badly as this movie would have viewers believe.The Warner Bros. DVD presents this film on both full and Widescreen formats on a double-sided single platter, making it necessary to handle with extreme care.  The image is less-than-awe-inspiring on an ordinary television or computer screen, at least for those few who caught this flick at the movie theater.  It's somewhat predictable and corny at times, but it is one of the few movies released in the past 15 years that treated its topic with an eye for accurate detail.  And while some of the shots did involve model aircraft, the filmmakers managed to round up all the surviving B-17s (in addition to a few American and German fighters), giving audiences a stirring tribute to all the aircrew who fought and died in World War II.",4,"Corny, yes, but a good film about B-17s",1055116800,"06 9, 2003",2003,2925,"['Memphis', 'Belle', 'Michael', 'Caton-Jones', 'fictionalized', '1990', 'account', 'real-life', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'B-17', 'final', 'mission', 'back', 'wartime', 'morale-boosting', 'films', 'Wake', 'Island', 'Air', 'Force', 'crew', 'Flying', 'Fortress', 'taking', 'part', 'bloody', 'aerial', 'campaign', 'Western', 'Europe', 'trying', 'survive', 'last', '25-mission', 'tour', 'duty.Produced', 'Catherine', 'Wyler', 'father', 'William', 'had', 'shot', 'documentary', 'real', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'version', 'familiar', 'clich', 'eacute', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'films', 'fleshes', 'out', 'fresh', 'Hollywood', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'best', 'known', 'now', 'Samwise', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'Reed', 'Diamond', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'are', 'ten', 'actors', 'who', 'portray', 'fictional', 'crew', 'Memphis', 'Belle.Released', 'buildup', 'Operations', 'Desert', 'Shield/Desert', 'Storm', 'very', 'retro', 'movie', 'failed', 'excite', 'audiences', 'even', 'so', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'impressive', 'ground', 'dispenses', 'expository', 'material.Set', 'England', 'May', '1943', 'story', 'somewhat', 'slowly', 'Army', 'Air', 'Force', 'PR', 'officer', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'annoyingly', 'crew', 'squadron', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'return', 'States', 'bomber', 'completed', '24', 'missions', 'Nazi-occupied', 'Europe', 'Now', 'only', 'thing', 'standing', 'war-weary', 'flyboys', 'home', 'one', 'last', 'mission', 'Bremen', 'are', 'usual', 'war', 'movie', 'get-to-know', 'crew', 'scenes', 'even', 'quick', 'not', 'graphic', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'one', 'lads', 'British', 'lass', 'ho', 'hum.But', 'when', 'dawn', 'bombers', 'are', 'sent', 'bomb', 'German', 'fighter-aircraft', 'factory', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'audience', 'harrowing', 'yet', 'mesmerizing', 'drama', 'daylight', 'bombing', 'raid', 'Germany', 'Here', 'are', 'Stealth', 'fighters', 'laser-guided', 'smart', 'bombs', 'flying', 'relative', 'ease', 'enemy', 'Instead', 'are', 'treated', 'almost', 'danger', 'faced', 'bomber', 'crews', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'mid', 'air', 'collisions', 'flak', 'enemy', 'fighters', 'even', 'case', 'friendly', 'fire', 'Naturally', 'most', 'havoc', 'inflicted', 'B-17s', 'falls', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'not', 'damaged', 'as', 'badly', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'viewers', 'believe.The', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'DVD', 'film', 'full', 'Widescreen', 'formats', 'double-sided', 'single', 'platter', 'making', 'necessary', 'handle', 'extreme', 'care', 'image', 'less-than-awe-inspiring', 'ordinary', 'television', 'computer', 'screen', 'least', 'few', 'who', 'caught', 'flick', 'movie', 'theater', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'corny', 'times', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'released', 'past', '15', 'years', 'treated', 'topic', 'eye', 'accurate', 'detail', 'shots', 'did', 'involve', 'model', 'aircraft', 'filmmakers', 'managed', 'round', 'up', 'surviving', 'B-17s', 'addition', 'few', 'American', 'German', 'fighters', 'giving', 'audiences', 'stirring', 'tribute', 'aircrew', 'who', 'fought', 'died', 'World', 'War', 'II']",N/A

274473,ALR35EFI69S5R,6301959957,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[66, 68]","I watched this great movie with wonder at all the restored vintage B-17 bombers used in the filming. When one watches as they take off and land with such dangerous imprecision, it's remarkable to realize how far we've  come technologically since those dangerous days of daylight bombing by the  Americans (the Brits went at night) and the murderous losses over German  skies. All of this as depicted was before we developed the P-51 with its  much longer range and its ability to escort the bombers to the target area  to fend off Luftwaffe fighters who shot down so many bombers in 1942, 1943,  and 1944.This is a wonderful movie, very accurate, authentic, and  quite appealing. Starring Matthew Modine as the Pilot of the fabled  ""Memphis Belle"", the first bomber crew to accomplish its mission tour and  be returned to the states (to sell war bonds, among other things), is  retells the amazing story of how thousands of kids as depicted here went  off to England to fly thousands and thousands of planes through the  perilous skies of Europe in a sustained effort to bomb the Third Reich into  submission. Off they went, seeking the industrial and urban targets,  knowing full well they might as well have had `bullseyes' painted on their  fuselages.  The costs of flying the missions in terms of lost people and  planes were almost overwhelming to the Allies.The story is told in all  its fullness, and one comes to recognize just how many of these plucky kids  leaving the air field would never come back, as the daily losses to German  fighters, flak and mishap were atrocious. Yet they went up again the next  day and the next and the next, in a dazzling display of uncommon courage,  tenacity, and maturity beyond their tender years. This is a poignant and  well-told, scripted and acted story brilliantly photographed on location  over the hills and dales of bonny olde England, where it all unfolded in  its grand yet grisly magnificence fifty some years ago.

Brown,"[1, 1]","World War II aviation enthusiasts will find enough holes in ""Memphis Belle"" to fly a B-17 through and it has been extensively dissected on the ""Memphis Belle"" website, as this is a real aircraft that has been fully restored. The ""Memphis Belle"" was the first Flying Fortress to complete 25 missions and then sent stateside with its crew to raise money for war bonds. This film purports to show what happened on that final mission but, of course, it is all fabrication. There are some subplots that would appear ludicrous to a real WWII bomber crew, not the least a co-pilot whining that he has nothing to do and then leaving his post during an air battle! In truth, bomber missions were not only long and grueling but dangerous, the pilot often getting killed or wounded along the way. Add to that the cheesy FX graphics and clich&eacute;d cast members (One Jew, one hillbilly, one poet, one Italian, a coward who learns courage etc) and you could write off this film as second rate.What saves it is excellent ensemble acting, great music, thrilling air combat scenes and one unforgettable vignette that shows the viciousness of air combat through the actual gun camera footage of German fighter planes. Watching the Forts get chewed to shreds in real life is sobering and adds some weight to the story. There is also a great acting role for David Strathairn, as the squadron commander, Col. Harriman who practically bleeds for his men. His showdown with the obnoxious public relations huckster Lt. Col. Derringer is a study of barely contained rage.A reliable cast rounds out the crew, from Mathew Modine's mother hen of a Captain Dearborn, Tate Donovan (""Damages"") as his surly co-pilot, the always reliable Eric Stoltz, Harry Connick Jr. Sean Astin, D.B. Sweeney and a surprisingly sweet turn by Reed Diamond as top gunner, Virgil Hoogesteger.It's worth noting that in this age of computer-generated reality, the most convincing scenes are those of the 1/4 scale models of the B-17's which, lined up on the runway, look like the real deal. Only 6 real Fortresses were available for the film so the rest of the squadron was filled in by good old fashioned model making.",4,Imperfect but still worth watching,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,2171,"['World', 'War', 'II', 'aviation', 'enthusiasts', 'will', 'find', 'enough', 'holes', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'fly', 'B-17', 'been', 'extensively', 'dissected', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'website', 'real', 'aircraft', 'been', 'fully', 'restored', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'was', 'first', 'Flying', 'Fortress', 'complete', '25', 'missions', 'then', 'sent', 'stateside', 'crew', 'raise', 'money', 'war', 'bonds', 'film', 'show', 'what', 'happened', 'final', 'mission', 'course', 'fabrication', 'are', 'subplots', 'would', 'appear', 'ludicrous', 'real', 'WWII', 'bomber', 'crew', 'not', 'least', 'co-pilot', 'whining', 'nothing', 'do', 'then', 'leaving', 'post', 'air', 'battle', 'truth', 'bomber', 'missions', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'long', 'grueling', 'dangerous', 'pilot', 'often', 'getting', 'killed', 'wounded', 'way', 'Add', 'cheesy', 'FX', 'graphics', 'clich', 'eacute', 'cast', 'members', 'One', 'Jew', 'one', 'hillbilly', 'one', 'poet', 'one', 'Italian', 'coward', 'who', 'courage', 'etc', 'could', 'write', 'off', 'film', 'second', 'excellent', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'great', 'music', 'thrilling', 'air', 'combat', 'scenes', 'one', 'unforgettable', 'vignette', 'viciousness', 'air', 'combat', 'actual', 'gun', 'camera', 'footage', 'German', 'fighter', 'planes', 'Watching', 'Forts', 'get', 'chewed', 'shreds', 'real', 'life', 'sobering', 'weight', 'story', 'also', 'great', 'acting', 'role', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'squadron', 'commander', 'Col.', 'Harriman', 'who', 'practically', 'men', 'showdown', 'obnoxious', 'public', 'relations', 'huckster', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Derringer', 'study', 'barely', 'contained', 'rage.A', 'reliable', 'cast', 'out', 'crew', 'Mathew', 'Modine', 'mother', 'hen', 'Captain', 'Dearborn', 'Tate', 'Donovan', 'Damages', 'surly', 'co-pilot', 'always', 'reliable', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'D.B', 'Sweeney', 'surprisingly', 'sweet', 'turn', 'Reed', 'Diamond', 'top', 'gunner', 'Virgil', 'Hoogesteger.It', 'worth', 'noting', 'age', 'computer-generated', 'reality', 'most', 'convincing', 'scenes', 'are', '1/4', 'scale', 'models', 'B-17', 'lined', 'up', 'runway', 'look', 'real', 'deal', 'Only', '6', 'real', 'Fortresses', 'were', 'available', 'film', 'rest', 'squadron', 'was', 'filled', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'model', 'making']",N/A

Only the most cynical of viewers will fail to be moved by its simple but appealing presentation.""Memphis Belle"" is a fictionalized account of what happened to a real B-17 crew on its 25th and final mission in Europe before being eligible to rotate home.  In the movie, the crew's mission is a daylight run over the heavily-defended target of Dresden.  An ensemble cast headed by Matthew Modine as the sober young pilot-in-charge goes through its flight preparations, while a series of short vignettes introduces the viewer to the individual members of the crew. The stand-out young cast includes Eric Stoltz as a radio operator with aspirations of being a poet; Tate Donovan as the cocky, attention-seeking co-pilot; Billy Zane as a bombardier who is about to pay a price for living a lie; DB Sweeney as the flak-happy navigator; and in a superb cameo, jazz musician Harry Connick, Jr, as the tail gunner.  Connick, by the way, does a impressive job on an improvised version of ""Danny Boy"" early in the movie.The action involving the aircrew on its mission is nicely balanced by a subplot on the ground, as a war-weary Bomber Group commander (earnestly played by David Straitharn) must reel in a cynical public affairs officer (John Lithgow). Their confrontation provides context to what is happening to the Memphis Belle in the air.The final mission turns into a nightmare of flak, enemy fighters, casualties, and mechanical failures, as the crews ends up nursing a stricken bomber towards its home field in England.  The final minutes of the movie should leave no viewer unmoved.This movie is highly recommended to those looking for an entertaining but fairly realistic movie on the bomber campaign against Hitler's Germany.",4,"Sentimental, But It Works!",1181952000,"06 16, 2007",2007,1896,"['1990', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'may', 'be', 'sentimental', 'sometimes', 'corny', 'story', 'bomber', 'crews', 'flying', 'dangerous', 'missions', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'wonderfully', 'well', 'Only', 'most', 'cynical', 'viewers', 'will', 'fail', 'be', 'moved', 'simple', 'appealing', 'presentation', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'what', 'happened', 'real', 'B-17', 'crew', '25th', 'final', 'mission', 'Europe', 'being', 'eligible', 'rotate', 'home', 'movie', 'crew', 'mission', 'daylight', 'run', 'heavily-defended', 'target', 'Dresden', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'headed', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'sober', 'young', 'pilot-in-charge', 'flight', 'preparations', 'series', 'short', 'vignettes', 'viewer', 'individual', 'members', 'crew', 'stand-out', 'young', 'cast', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'radio', 'operator', 'aspirations', 'being', 'poet', 'Tate', 'Donovan', 'cocky', 'attention-seeking', 'co-pilot', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'bombardier', 'who', 'pay', 'price', 'living', 'lie', 'DB', 'Sweeney', 'flak-happy', 'navigator', 'superb', 'cameo', 'jazz', 'musician', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr', 'tail', 'gunner', 'Connick', 'way', 'impressive', 'job', 'improvised', 'version', 'Danny', 'Boy', 'early', 'movie.The', 'action', 'involving', 'aircrew', 'mission', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'subplot', 'ground', 'war-weary', 'Bomber', 'Group', 'commander', 'earnestly', 'played', 'David', 'Straitharn', 'must', 'reel', 'cynical', 'public', 'affairs', 'officer', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'confrontation', 'context', 'what', 'happening', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'air.The', 'final', 'mission', 'nightmare', 'flak', 'enemy', 'fighters', 'casualties', 'mechanical', 'failures', 'crews', 'up', 'nursing', 'stricken', 'bomber', 'home', 'field', 'England', 'final', 'minutes', 'movie', 'should', 'leave', 'viewer', 'unmoved.This', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'looking', 'entertaining', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'movie', 'bomber', 'campaign', 'Hitler', 'Germany']",N/A

It's loaded with lots of names and faces you've come to recognize over the years.This is pretty straight forward both in the story and the way it's told. The Memphis Belle was the first bomber in WWII to achieve 25 missions without being shot down which gave their crew a free ticket home. This is the story of the 25th mission. As in any number of other military movies, the first part is meeting those involved, particularly the crew. Then you head onto the mission itself.It's a pretty thrilling ride. You get to know enough about each of the crew members to care what happens to them when things hit the fan. The dog fights between the single pilot fighters are OK, (nothing to write home about) and the attacks on the bombers themselves have some pretty cool moments. Some of the dialogue during the flight isn't really very good but you're with these guys in their plight so you hang in with them and worry for them as certain circumstances arise.I don't know how many of the details are true or if there is a liberal sprinkling of Hollywood thrown in, but they keep you going up to the final moment.This is not good art but it's good craft.

The B-17 was the primary plane used for these missions, and the ""Memphis Belle"" was one of them.  This movie takes a look at the bombing campaign against the Germans as well as a rough account of the flight of the ""Memphis Belle"".  The movie stars Matthew Modine as Dennis, the captain, who doesn't seem to have totally earned the respect of his crew.  Tate Donovan stars as Luke, the co-pilot, who is jealous of Dennis and longs for his own plane.  Billy Zane stars as Val, the bombardier, who claims to be a doctor but in reality has had only 2 weeks of medical school.  D.B. Sweeney stars as Phil, the navigator, who is convinced he is going to die and tries to give away all of his possessions to the crew.  Harry Connick, Jr. is the tail gunner who is persuaded to sing at the group's anniversary party.  Sean Astin plays Rascal, the ball turret gunner, who is afraid of the turret jamming at a bad time.  Eric Stoltz plays Danny, the radio operator, who loves poetry and photography.  Courtney Gains  plays Gene, the waist gunner, who is very superstitious. John Lithgow plays an Army PR officer whose only concern is taking pictures of the crew and preparing a party for them after their final mission.  He has very little concern for anything or anyone else.The battle scenes are first-rate.  The flak and the jarring of the aircraft are very realistic as well as the German fighter attacks. I thought the use of models in the film was very well-done, too.  They looked very realistic, and I couldn't distinguish them from the real planes.I've watched this movie several times, and it gets better with each viewing.

It impressed me that they even got the Belle's model (B-17F) right; I didn't know there were any flying F's still around, most are G-models.There were some inaccuracies though.  Why did they glamorize the Belle's name on the nose, when it actually was made up of plain block letters?  The ""little friends"" (fighter escort) would not be made up of P-51's in early 1943, more than likely P-47s; I can forgive this one because there are only a couple of flyable ""Jugs"" left.  The Belle's 25th mission was actually a ""milk run"" over France; they did fly once over Bremen but I believe that was around their 20th mission.  Smoking was not allowed on, or anywhere near, the bombers.  I could list several other things, but you get my point.Still, it was one of the better bomber movies in many ways.

Bryan,"[17, 20]","If you can penetrate (like a B-17 cutting through cloud cover) all the character cliches and a certain old-fashioned hokey aura, you'll find a harrowing depiction of daylight bombing, circa 1943. What you won't find is an accurate account of the real Memphis Belle's 25th mission, or anyone resembling the actual men who flew her that day.Matthew Modine captains this fictionalized crew, with support from resentful co-pilot Tate Donovan, dishonest bombadier Billy Zane, panicked navigator D.B. Sweeney and wiseacre belly gunner Sean Astin. Tailgunner Harry Connick, Jr. gets to display his vocals and piano skills in a musical number, dedicated to waistgunner Eric Stoltz, that stalls the film in the early going.While the real Memphis Belle experienced a somewhat less dramatic run to a different target, this film's mission is to depict the aerial terrors of that year in Europe, when American airmen suffered more losses than any other branch of our armed forces. Direct hit! Massive B-17 formations thunder across the sky, flak rips planes apart, and in one chilling moment, an enemy fighter slices one bomber in half, and our heroes hear the panicked screams of its doomed crew over the radio.The battle scenes are horrific, and the character scenes are just horrible. It's not that the acting is of poor quality; it isn't. It's that each crewmember faces some sort of hackneyed personal crisis and comes through in true cliched fashion, which somewhat cheapens what the real crew experienced. It's literally one thing after another, a bombing run as group therapy. The film relies exclusively on stock Hollywood types, rather than human beings. Plus, Sweeney's fearful character does a disservice to the real Belle's navigator. Modine comes off best, with his youthful appearance and dedication, as he admonishes his crew not to shout their targets over the intercom. John Lithgow has the thankless task of portraying the coldblooded PR officer who's more concerned with publicity tours than the men's welfare, or their mission's stategic/tactical importance.Despite its failings as a ""true"" story, this is a film worth watching.

274521,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6301959957,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 10]","My first favorite television series was ""Twelve O'Clock High"" and I had at least two models of the ""Memphis Belle"" when I was kid, all of which simply reflects the fact that the B-17 Flying Fortress is my favorite airplane.  When I was a kid my family was driving through California and there was a B-17 parked out on somebody's front lawn on a ranch and for years I tried to figure out how to go back and see it.  A couple of decades later one of the few B-17s still flying came to the Zenith City and I finally got to go inside one (this big bombers are a lot smaller than I ever thought).  For all I know that particular B-17 ended up flying in the 1990 film ""Memphis Belle.""  When I had occasion to drive through the city of Memphis, of course I made a point of visiting Mud Island where the ""Memphis Belle"" was on display (she was moved to the Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio this October).The ""Memphis Belle"" (Serial No. 41-24485) was one of 12,750 B-17 Flying Fortresses built by the Boeing Aircraft Company, but it was the most famous because it was the first heavy bomber to complete 25 combat missions over Hitler's Europe without losing a crew member.  The idea of 25 missions and going home was established by the bomber command as an incentive for air crews because morale was desperately low after the first three months of American combat flights over Europe during which eighty percent of the planes were shot down.  The ""Belle"" flew from November 7, 1942 to May 17, 1943 and its final flight is the fanciful subject of this film directed by Michael Caton-Jones (""Scandal"") from the script by Monte Merrick (""Staying Together"").That simply means that besides the fact that the ""Memphis Belle"" was named for a lady friend (Margaret Polk) of the pilot and that the art on the nose depicting the same (designed by the famous artist George Petty) there is nothing here that is historically accurate when it comes to that final mission, which was over Lorient, France and not Bremen, Germany (the ""Belle"" flew there on its 21st mission).  The names of the crew are all changed and I think the same applies to the plane's mascot, a Scotty Dog named ""Stuka.""  So if you want something closer to the ""true"" story of the pilot Robert Morgan and the ""Memphis Belle"" you want to check out William Wyler's 1944 documentary ""The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress.""What you have here instead is a Hollywood movie that celebrates the men who flew these bombers in World War II by incorporating a wide variety of clich&eacute;s from war movies involving airplanes.  Then there is the whole idea that Americans from all walks of life who have little in common besides a desire to get home alive band together to fight the Nazis.  So it is we have the young and recognizable faces of Matthew Modine as the business like pilot, Eric Stoltz as the poetic radio operator, Tate Donovan as the co-pilot who wants to actually do something before he goes home, D.B. Sweeney as the navigator who is convinced his number is up, Billy Zane as the bombardier who left medical school to fight, Sean Austin as the runt who is stuck in the ball turret, Reed Edward Diamond as the flight engineer, Courtney Gains and Neil Giuntoli as the bickering waist gunners, and Harry Connick as tail gunner and sometime crooner.Back at the base David Strathairn plays the commanding officer nervous about his boys getting back alive and John Lithgow is the public relations officer the Army has sent  to celebrate the final mission of the ""Belle.""  Of course, it is hard to create tension given that most viewers know the ""Memphis Belle"" is remembered for completing that final mission, so any tension that is created tends to be somewhat artificial although there are some nice moments during the bomb run (the film might play better if it simply inspired by the ""Belle"" and they changed the name of the aircraft as well) .  But even if the ""Belle"" survives there are other several B-17 crews on the mission who will not.  Still, the idea that doing your duty could not just be dangerous but be outright suicidal is communicated, allowing Modine's character to explain the job to his nervous crew and underscore that Americans do not believe in collateral damage.  But what will probably stand out in this film is the grim lesson that Donovan's character learns when he tries to be a hero by doing somebody else's job.",4,"A fanciful account of the final mission of the famous ""Memphis Belle""",1133913600,"12 7, 2005",2005,4402,"['first', 'favorite', 'television', 'series', 'was', 'Twelve', ""O'Clock"", 'High', 'had', 'least', 'two', 'models', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'simply', 'fact', 'B-17', 'Flying', 'Fortress', 'favorite', 'airplane', 'When', 'was', 'kid', 'family', 'was', 'driving', 'California', 'was', 'B-17', 'parked', 'out', 'somebody', 'front', 'lawn', 'ranch', 'years', 'tried', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'couple', 'decades', 'later', 'one', 'few', 'B-17s', 'still', 'flying', 'came', 'Zenith', 'City', 'finally', 'got', 'go', 'inside', 'one', 'big', 'bombers', 'are', 'lot', 'smaller', 'ever', 'thought', 'know', 'particular', 'B-17', 'ended', 'up', 'flying', '1990', 'film', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'When', 'had', 'occasion', 'drive', 'city', 'Memphis', 'course', 'made', 'point', 'visiting', 'Mud', 'Island', 'where', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'was', 'display', 'was', 'moved', 'Air', 'Force', 'Museum', 'Dayton', 'Ohio', 'October', '.The', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'Serial', '41-24485', 'was', 'one', '12,750', 'B-17', 'Flying', 'Fortresses', 'built', 'Boeing', 'Aircraft', 'Company', 'was', 'most', 'famous', 'was', 'first', 'heavy', 'bomber', 'complete', '25', 'combat', 'missions', 'Hitler', 'Europe', 'losing', 'crew', 'member', 'idea', '25', 'missions', 'going', 'home', 'was', 'established', 'bomber', 'command', 'incentive', 'air', 'crews', 'morale', 'was', 'desperately', 'low', 'first', 'three', 'months', 'American', 'combat', 'flights', 'Europe', 'eighty', 'percent', 'planes', 'were', 'shot', 'down', 'Belle', 'flew', 'November', '7', '1942', 'May', '17', '1943', 'final', 'flight', 'fanciful', 'subject', 'film', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Caton-Jones', 'Scandal', 'script', 'Monte', 'Merrick', 'Staying', 'Together', 'simply', 'fact', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'was', 'named', 'lady', 'friend', 'Margaret', 'Polk', 'pilot', 'art', 'nose', 'depicting', 'same', 'designed', 'famous', 'artist', 'George', 'Petty', 'nothing', 'here', 'historically', 'accurate', 'when', 'final', 'mission', 'was', 'Lorient', 'France', 'not', 'Bremen', 'Germany', 'Belle', 'flew', '21st', 'mission', 'names', 'crew', 'are', 'changed', 'think', 'same', 'applies', 'plane', 'mascot', 'Scotty', 'Dog', 'named', 'Stuka', 'So', 'want', 'something', 'closer', 'true', 'story', 'pilot', 'Robert', 'Morgan', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'William', 'Wyler', '1944', 'documentary', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'Story', 'Flying', 'Fortress', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'instead', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'men', 'who', 'flew', 'bombers', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'incorporating', 'wide', 'variety', 'clich', 'eacute', 'war', 'movies', 'involving', 'airplanes', 'Then', 'whole', 'idea', 'walks', 'life', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'common', 'desire', 'get', 'home', 'alive', 'band', 'together', 'fight', 'Nazis', 'have', 'young', 'recognizable', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'business', 'pilot', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'poetic', 'radio', 'operator', 'Tate', 'Donovan', 'co-pilot', 'who', 'actually', 'do', 'something', 'home', 'D.B', 'Sweeney', 'navigator', 'who', 'convinced', 'number', 'up', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'bombardier', 'who', 'left', 'medical', 'school', 'fight', 'Sean', 'Austin', 'runt', 'who', 'stuck', 'ball', 'turret', 'Reed', 'Edward', 'Diamond', 'flight', 'engineer', 'Courtney', 'Gains', 'Neil', 'Giuntoli', 'bickering', 'waist', 'gunners', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'tail', 'gunner', 'sometime', 'crooner.Back', 'base', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'commanding', 'officer', 'nervous', 'boys', 'getting', 'back', 'alive', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'public', 'relations', 'officer', 'Army', 'sent', 'celebrate', 'final', 'mission', 'Belle', 'course', 'hard', 'create', 'tension', 'given', 'most', 'viewers', 'know', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'remembered', 'completing', 'final', 'mission', 'tension', 'created', 'tends', 'be', 'somewhat', 'artificial', 'are', 'nice', 'moments', 'bomb', 'run', 'film', 'might', 'play', 'better', 'simply', 'inspired', 'Belle', 'changed', 'name', 'aircraft', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'Belle', 'are', 'other', 'several', 'B-17', 'crews', 'mission', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'Still', 'idea', 'doing', 'duty', 'could', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'dangerous', 'be', 'outright', 'suicidal', 'communicated', 'allowing', 'Modine', 'character', 'explain', 'job', 'nervous', 'crew', 'underscore', 'Americans', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'collateral', 'damage', 'what', 'will', 'probably', 'stand', 'out', 'film', 'grim', 'lesson', 'Donovan', 'character', 'when', 'be', 'hero', 'doing', 'somebody', 'else', 'job']",N/A

Early in the war it was a very hard time for the Americans whose missions were daylight bombardment over Hitler's fortress Europe. The movie shows specifically what is was like to fly a mission while in formation with attacking German fighters and over the target with the incoming flack of the guns below. Casualties were very high with many flights not coming back from a raid. Morale was extremely low. So high command established the goal of 25 missions. Once you came back from that you were home free. In May 1943 the Memphis Belle became the first U.S. Army Air Forces heavy bomber to complete 25 missions over Europe. It then returned to the United States. The pilot, then-Lt. Robert Morgan, named the aircraft after his wartime girlfriend, Margaret Polk, of Memphis, Tenn.  The film is outstanding as it mixes in real combat footage of what it was like being on a bomb run over the dangerous skies over Europe, as the lead plane would drop the bombs and the rest of the planes would follow suit. The B-17 used a bombsight that was a secret but worked very effective in getting the bomb loads on the targets for the day. The film shows the dedication and the can do determination to place the bombs on the targets as they flew through flak ticker than pea soup. The Memphis Belle after the war was restored to flying conditions and often you could see it at the different air shows around the country. Back in 1993 as I recall I had the pleasure of seeing it in a fly-in at Eglin AFB with other planes of WWII. It was very exciting for the WWII pilot Lt. Robert Morgan brought her in and it landed safely. I gave the film five stars for its outstanding portrayal of what it was like to live in England and fly a daily mission to drop your payloads on strategic targets in Europe to win the war in the skies and gain supremacy. I feel strongly that nobody even today can see such a film and not appreciate the courage and bravery of the aircrews that flew the B-17's over fortress Europe to win the war of the skies.",5,Memphis Belle Review,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,2126,"['Memphis', 'Belle', 'B-17F', 'Flying', 'Fortress', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'aircraft', 'history', 'WWII', 'Early', 'war', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'time', 'Americans', 'missions', 'were', 'daylight', 'bombardment', 'Hitler', 'fortress', 'Europe', 'movie', 'specifically', 'what', 'was', 'fly', 'mission', 'formation', 'attacking', 'German', 'fighters', 'target', 'incoming', 'flack', 'guns', 'Casualties', 'were', 'very', 'high', 'many', 'flights', 'not', 'coming', 'back', 'raid', 'Morale', 'was', 'extremely', 'low', 'So', 'high', 'command', 'established', 'goal', '25', 'missions', 'Once', 'came', 'back', 'were', 'home', 'free', 'May', '1943', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'became', 'first', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Air', 'Forces', 'heavy', 'bomber', 'complete', '25', 'missions', 'Europe', 'then', 'returned', 'United', 'States', 'pilot', 'then-Lt.', 'Robert', 'Morgan', 'named', 'aircraft', 'wartime', 'girlfriend', 'Margaret', 'Polk', 'Memphis', 'Tenn', 'film', 'outstanding', 'real', 'combat', 'footage', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'bomb', 'run', 'dangerous', 'skies', 'Europe', 'lead', 'plane', 'would', 'drop', 'bombs', 'rest', 'planes', 'would', 'follow', 'suit', 'B-17', 'used', 'bombsight', 'was', 'secret', 'worked', 'very', 'effective', 'getting', 'bomb', 'targets', 'day', 'film', 'dedication', 'can', 'do', 'determination', 'place', 'bombs', 'targets', 'flew', 'flak', 'ticker', 'pea', 'soup', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'war', 'was', 'restored', 'flying', 'conditions', 'often', 'could', 'see', 'different', 'air', 'country', 'Back', '1993', 'recall', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'fly-in', 'Eglin', 'AFB', 'other', 'planes', 'WWII', 'was', 'very', 'exciting', 'WWII', 'pilot', 'Lt.', 'Robert', 'Morgan', 'brought', 'landed', 'safely', 'gave', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'outstanding', 'portrayal', 'what', 'was', 'live', 'England', 'fly', 'daily', 'mission', 'drop', 'payloads', 'strategic', 'targets', 'Europe', 'win', 'war', 'skies', 'gain', 'supremacy', 'feel', 'strongly', 'nobody', 'even', 'today', 'can', 'see', 'such', 'film', 'not', 'appreciate', 'courage', 'bravery', 'aircrews', 'flew', 'B-17', 'fortress', 'Europe', 'win', 'war', 'skies']",N/A
274525,A1FNW6H983I87V,6301959957,"Loves To Read ""Lu""","[0, 0]","This WWII film is based on the true story of the Memphis Belle, a B-17 bomber and crew based in England and flying daylight (the most dangerous) bombing raids over Western Europe. They have flown 24 successful missions and one more and they'll be done and able to go home. They would be the first crew in the Eighth Air Force to finish all 25. The fatality rate of these daylight missions is so high as to almost be considered suicidal. Over 200,000 men were killed in air battles over Western Europe during WWII. Because of their size and flying relatively low over targets, they were especially vulnerable to being shot down. The bombs were dropped by visually sighting the target and dropping the bombs. Needless to say, there was a great deal of 'imprecision' in hitting their targets. If the lead plane was off target, the rest of planes following their lead would be wrong, also. In the film, we see how seriously this particular pilot took the commitment to hit military targets and avoid civilians, although that wasn't always the case (they're all Nazis as one crew member screamed in defiance). They Army and Look magazine have already lined up a 'victory tour' around the U.S. to promote the war once they finish their 25th mission. But have they jumped the gun? They draw the Bremen, Germany assignment, one of the most dangerous. Once the plane takes off on their final mission, you are drawn into this drama and it won't let you go. The film is also punctuated with some archival footage of aerial combat.

However IMHO this movie was barely watchable for many reasons. Scene one, bomber returns from mission, skids to a stop at the airfield, and detonates. Uh... there's no gas, bombs, or bullets on that B17, what exploded? Later in the movie they seem to show a crewman get ejected from an aircraft due to cabin decompression... these planes weren't pressurized.It's nice that the moviemakers took the effort to remove the chin turret from the B17 they used for filming. Kudos for that. But then to have Matt make a big speech during a bomb run that he's worried about a german school right next to the factory... What's that, a pc sanitization of bombing for audiences of the nineties? I believe CEP for a norden bombsight was a quarter mile, and don't you think that the Germans would be smart enough to move their children during a bombing raid??? Yeesh.This movie placed 90's attitudes and 90's adults in WWII cliches.

Or did the Luftwaffe have only two left by May of 1943?I kept waiting to see scenes of what the bombs were doing when they hit the ground-- killing thousands real people down there-- mostly children and women. Of course it is difficult to hit a target from 10,000 feet. Those bombs aimed at that factory were just as likely to land next door on the school or the hospital. (One problem the German intelligence had with the British bombing, and the Brits bombed more than we did, was figuring out what the target city was-- not which part of the city was the target-- but which city was the target.) And of course many civilians were living in the factories, since we had already bombed them out of their homes. But maybe if we kill the civilians, they will just give up and call it quits.Cute film; ""our"" men were brave, but do read the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, 1946, which stated that German industrial production increased greatly during the bombing.",3,But why did those Messerschmitts keep attacking in pairs-- to make themselves easier targets?,1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,1075,"['cute', 'polished', 'film', 'why', 'did', 'Messerschmitts', 'keep', 'attacking', 'pairs', 'make', 'easier', 'targets', 'did', 'Luftwaffe', 'have', 'only', 'two', 'left', 'May', '1943', 'kept', 'waiting', 'see', 'scenes', 'what', 'bombs', 'were', 'doing', 'when', 'hit', 'ground', 'killing', 'thousands', 'real', 'people', 'down', 'there', 'mostly', 'children', 'women', 'course', 'difficult', 'hit', 'target', '10,000', 'feet', 'bombs', 'aimed', 'factory', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'likely', 'land', 'next', 'door', 'school', 'hospital', 'One', 'problem', 'German', 'intelligence', 'had', 'British', 'bombing', 'Brits', 'bombed', 'more', 'did', 'was', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'target', 'city', 'was', 'not', 'part', 'city', 'was', 'target', 'city', 'was', 'target', 'course', 'many', 'civilians', 'were', 'living', 'factories', 'had', 'already', 'bombed', 'homes', 'maybe', 'kill', 'civilians', 'will', 'just', 'give', 'up', 'call', 'quits.Cute', 'film', 'men', 'were', 'brave', 'do', 'read', 'U.S.', 'Strategic', 'Bombing', 'Survey', '1946', 'stated', 'German', 'industrial', 'production', 'increased', 'greatly', 'bombing']",N/A

Nugent ""wildwildwill""","[1, 1]","When I was thirteen years old in the summer of 1977,I discovered an article in Boys life magazine.Next to it was an ad for the Monogram B-17G in 1/48 scale.That got me up and running,wanting to find out everything about the air war in Europe.I checked out the library book,air war over Hitler's Germany from school.I also bought and built the Monogram kit I mentioned.Then,I discovered the Memphis Belle,I believe it was Providence that led me in that direction.What better way to grow up than to have a sweetheart,Cathy,living in the same apartments and to be a student of the air war over the skies of Europe.Anyways,first,about the documentary,I viewed this short video of the Memphis Belle on her last mission by Billy Wilder,all I can say is WOW!Real combat footage of the air war in color!I love it because it had my heroes in the Belle fighting for mom,apple pie and the good ole U.S.A.I have mixed feelings about the movie because it did not focus on the Belle's last mission,but it was a compliation of ALL the air crews that flew over Europe and their experiences.The acting was good,the customes were authenic and the expressions from the time was on the button.The real B-17s that were used for the movie were the only five operational airplanes at the time of production,now only one actually is flyable.The location was refreshing,as it was filmed in part in old army air force bases(s) in England.The flight scenes were and are something to behold,very tight flying of the ME-109s attacking the formation of B-17s!The fifty cals blasting away as the crew breaths heavily through the oxygen masks adds to the tension you feel.You begin to believe that you are actually flying inside the Belle with the crew and fighting for your life!Of course,everyone of the Belle's crew has a story,from the furniture sales man to the guy from Cleveland...(there's always someone from Cleveland),to the rough guy from Chicago,or the one from a New orleans cat house,that's a piano player and the life guard from California.These guys lived every minute as if it were their last...because it could very well have been the next day!You'll love the group dance inside a hanger,a beautiful B-17F in the back ground.The music and the scene in the Belle's forward crew compartment with Virge.The bonding between the vet crews and the newbies,the advice...and the heartbreak of the Belle's last mission.On the down side though,there is no making of the movie documentary(like HBO's Belle and the Glory Boys),They could have included additional combat footage from the air war in Europe(many in color),a briefing on a mission,daily life on a USAAF air base in England,big band music or other cool stuff that would make this blu-ray even
