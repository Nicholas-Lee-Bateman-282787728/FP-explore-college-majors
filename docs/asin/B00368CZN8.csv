1327360,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00368CZN8,C. Sawin,"[10, 11]","&#34;Mr. Nobody&#34; began its run on the festival circuit back in 2009 and was released on DVD and Blu-ray in Canada in late 2010. The film was finally released in theaters in the United States in November of 2013; although obviously it had a limited run. It had been nearly four years since this critic&#8217;s first viewing of the film, so it was in dire need of a revisit to see if it had held up over that inevitable passing of time that the film brings into question at every turn. For the most part, &#34;Mr. Nobody&#34; is still the fantastic yet abstract and surreal experience it was when it was first released.It's quite incredible looking back at Jared Leto's acting career. The Louisiana-born actor is mostly known for his roles in &#34;American Psycho,&#34; &#34;Requiem for a Dream,&#34; and &#34;Lord of War&#34; and Leto has currently been getting a ton of awards for his performance as the AIDS-stricken drag queen Rayon in &#34;Dallas Buyers Club.&#34; Leto's performance in &#34;Mr. Nobody&#34; has shades of the impeccable talent Leto puts on full display in &#34;Dallas Buyers Club.&#34; Leto not only plays different versions of himself in &#34;Mr. Nobody,&#34; but the older version of himself is quite believable thanks not only to spectacular makeup effects but also because Leto is surprisingly convincing as an old man. With his trembling movements and the way his raspy vocals seem to quaver uncontrollably from just simply speaking of his extraordinary past, Leto illustrates that he's one of the most talented actors working today.The science fiction drama by Belgian director Jaco Van Dormael has a way of making you question your existence quite literally. The film often brings in the movement of time; why does it always have to move forward? Can it be manipulated? &#34;Mr. Nobody&#34; looks at every possible decision a specific individual can make in their lifetime and how those lives are affected by every decision he or she has made. It's a lot to take in and it's even more to find yourself contemplating, but the film stays with you for that reason alone. It's practically guaranteed you'll reflect on what you've done in your lifetime once &#34;Mr. Nobody&#34; ends and what could have been if you had just taken a different path. No matter how drastic or minuscule those changes might be, your life would be forever altered because of them.However, there are a few setbacks that stick out after seeing the film a second time; the main issue being that the duration is a bit too long. Sitting at nearly 160 minutes, &#34;Mr. Nobody&#34; does tend to drag quite a bit at times especially when such a large portion of the film is devoted to a teenage Nemo (portrayed by Toby Regbo) and his crush Anna (Juno Temple) rolling around under sheets in their underwear and chasing each other's genitals when they are practically brother and sister. Sarah Polley will also infuriate you. The Elise character cries at absolutely everything and is crippled by depression, but her griping of wondering what the problem is and being a bad parent could probably be solved by getting up and not drowning in a violent tantrum puddle of her own epiphora every time she's on screen.Pondering your existence and realizing that not making a decision is the only decision are a few of the things &#34;Mr. Nobody&#34; touches on. You're where you are right now because of certain decisions you made in your life. But where would you be if you had lived with your dad instead of your mom growing up? Or if you married someone else? The possibilities are endless and &#34;Mr. Nobody&#34; portrays those what if scenarios flawlessly.Complex, visually stunning, and pleasantly convoluted in an enjoyable sense, &#34;Mr. Nobody&#34; is a film that seems like it can't be confined to one genre and while time flows in one continuous direction &#34;Mr. Nobody&#34; makes it a point to constantly pedal in the opposite direction. Let your mind wander and drift into the bowels of yourself while viewing the bizarre, dreamlike, and intricate sequences of &#34;Mr. Nobody.&#34;",4,Chase the bear and turn back time,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,4088,"['34', 'Mr.', 'Nobody', '34', 'began', 'run', 'festival', 'circuit', 'back', '2009', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'Canada', 'late', '2010', 'film', 'was', 'finally', 'released', 'theaters', 'United', 'States', 'November', '2013', 'had', 'limited', 'run', 'had', 'been', 'nearly', 'four', 'years', 'critic', '8217', 'first', 'viewing', 'film', 'was', 'dire', 'need', 'revisit', 'see', 'had', 'held', 'up', 'inevitable', 'passing', 'time', 'film', 'question', 'turn', 'most', 'part', '34', 'Mr.', 'Nobody', '34', 'still', 'fantastic', 'abstract', 'surreal', 'experience', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released.It', 'quite', 'incredible', 'looking', 'back', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'acting', 'career', 'Louisiana-born', 'actor', 'mostly', 'known', 'roles', '34', 'American', 'Psycho', '34', '34', 'Requiem', 'Dream', '34', '34', 'Lord', 'War', '34', 'Leto', 'currently', 'been', 'getting', 'ton', 'awards', 'performance', 'AIDS-stricken', 'drag', 'queen', 'Rayon', '34', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club.', '34', 'Leto', 'performance', '34', 'Mr.', 'Nobody', '34', 'shades', 'impeccable', 'talent', 'Leto', 'full', 'display', '34', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club.', '34', 'Leto', 'not', 'only', 'different', 'versions', '34', 'Mr.', 'Nobody', '34', 'older', 'version', 'quite', 'believable', 'thanks', 'not', 'only', 'spectacular', 'makeup', 'effects', 'also', 'Leto', 'surprisingly', 'convincing', 'old', 'man', 'trembling', 'movements', 'way', 'raspy', 'vocals', 'seem', 'quaver', 'uncontrollably', 'just', 'simply', 'speaking', 'extraordinary', 'past', 'Leto', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'actors', 'working', 'today.The', 'science', 'fiction', 'drama', 'Belgian', 'director', 'Jaco', 'Van', 'Dormael', 'way', 'making', 'question', 'existence', 'quite', 'literally', 'film', 'often', 'movement', 'time', 'why', 'always', 'have', 'move', 'forward', 'Can', 'be', 'manipulated', '34', 'Mr.', 'Nobody', '34', 'looks', 'possible', 'decision', 'specific', 'individual', 'can', 'make', 'lifetime', 'how', 'lives', 'are', 'affected', 'decision', 'made', 'lot', 'take', 'even', 'more', 'find', 'contemplating', 'film', 'reason', 'alone', 'practically', 'guaranteed', ""'ll"", 'reflect', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'lifetime', 'once', '34', 'Mr.', 'Nobody', '34', 'ends', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'just', 'taken', 'different', 'path', 'matter', 'how', 'drastic', 'minuscule', 'changes', 'might', 'be', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'forever', 'altered', 'them.However', 'are', 'few', 'setbacks', 'stick', 'out', 'seeing', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'main', 'issue', 'being', 'duration', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'Sitting', 'nearly', '160', 'minutes', '34', 'Mr.', 'Nobody', '34', 'tend', 'drag', 'quite', 'bit', 'times', 'especially', 'when', 'such', 'large', 'portion', 'film', 'devoted', 'teenage', 'Nemo', 'portrayed', 'Toby', 'Regbo', 'crush', 'Anna', 'Juno', 'Temple', 'rolling', 'around', 'sheets', 'underwear', 'chasing', 'other', 'genitals', 'when', 'are', 'practically', 'brother', 'sister', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'will', 'also', 'infuriate', 'Elise', 'character', 'cries', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'crippled', 'depression', 'griping', 'wondering', 'what', 'problem', 'being', 'bad', 'parent', 'could', 'probably', 'be', 'solved', 'getting', 'up', 'not', 'drowning', 'violent', 'tantrum', 'puddle', 'own', 'epiphora', 'time', 'screen.Pondering', 'existence', 'realizing', 'not', 'making', 'decision', 'only', 'decision', 'are', 'few', 'things', '34', 'Mr.', 'Nobody', '34', 'touches', ""'re"", 'where', 'are', 'right', 'now', 'certain', 'decisions', 'made', 'life', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'had', 'lived', 'dad', 'instead', 'mom', 'growing', 'up', 'married', 'someone', 'else', 'possibilities', 'are', 'endless', '34', 'Mr.', 'Nobody', '34', 'portrays', 'what', 'scenarios', 'flawlessly.Complex', 'visually', 'stunning', 'pleasantly', 'convoluted', 'enjoyable', 'sense', '34', 'Mr.', 'Nobody', '34', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'confined', 'one', 'genre', 'time', 'one', 'continuous', 'direction', '34', 'Mr.', 'Nobody', '34', 'point', 'constantly', 'pedal', 'opposite', 'direction', 'Let', 'mind', 'wander', 'drift', 'bowels', 'viewing', 'bizarre', 'dreamlike', 'intricate', 'sequences', '34', 'Mr.', 'Nobody.', '34']",N/A

Nemo is the oldest mortal on earth and he's at death's door. Everyone else has become immortal. A journalist sneaks into Nemo's hospital room to interview him. He's puzzled because Nemo seems to be telling three different life stories. Nemo sees it as each story being valid depending on which choice he made on the day his parents separated.This has to be the most inventive and ambitious film I've ever seen. I was hanging on by my fingernails trying to keep pace. It's filled with dazzling visuals, great dialogue and a wondrous story. I would need to see this some number of times more to see if all the pieces do, in fact, fit together. Even if they don't this ride is so wild I'd gladly board again. There are some repeating motifs. Eyes, water, vases (urns) play parts in many scenes. Life and death. Choose or not. Free will vs. predestination. It also has very inventive camera work as well. A few of the shots were a bit &#34;too&#34; but at 157 minutes (director's cut) that's easy to forgive.The story is key though. The young boy on the train platform. Stay with dad or go with mom. If he doesn't choose all the parallel lives he leads are valid. Jared Leto does a great job. He's a different person in each life. He has a different wife in each life but the girl he lost (Juno Temple) is the obvious favorite. Sarah Polley gets second bill which is odd in that she has a woefully small amount of screen time. I's a shame because she's great in her few scenes. One scene, where she invades her daughter's birthday party, is incredible.This film is too much the epic to do justice in such a small space here.

Kline ""art & technology""","[48, 49]","The idea of multiple universes and how each choice we make can lead to an entirely different life is something that has been brought up a number of times in the realm of science fiction.  It has even made its way into movies and television, most notably seen recently in JJ Abrams' Fringe TV seriesFringe: The Complete First Season(highly recommended, btw).This movie doesn't start out simple and lead up to something complex.  It plunges you right into the thick of it at the onset.  A very peculiar looking doctor with a bizarre ""head tattoo"" interviews the elderly subject, a man who we then discover is the focus of this movie, in various incarnations.  And so, we ""begin"" our journey into this life of his... there are moments from childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, in a somewhat general progression, but there's also some jumping back and forth.  It's a bit confusing at first...Just try to remember that you can't watch this movie and try to ""understand"" it all in a conventional way.  You simply have to let it flow before you... just take it as it comes.  It's the kind of thing where you'll have a sense of what this movie is really about towards the end of it.  But ""end"" is kind of a misnomer here.  Your traditional story has a concrete beginning and ending... this has neither.  It's more of an experience than a traditional story.I can't really say too much more about it... however, the key message that is delivered is phenomenal.  At least, I found it to be.  It's that although you will face tough choices in life, and be very indecisive about what choice or path to take, don't get caught up in that.  Make a choice.  And even if you begin to feel that the choice you made was the wrong one, think again.  There is no wrong choice.  Just different ones.

Cinematography, music, attention to detail, props, models were well thought out and contributed toward understanding the storyline and not just time or visual filling substitutes. Costuming and makeup prosthetics (the aging of Nemo took 5 hours) were exceptional. CGI was not just pointless, make believe eye-candy but contributed important, and again intelligent, visuals to the story.Consequences of random butterfly effects that occur at critical periods in one's life resulting in subsequent consequences are contrasted with conscious decisions we choose to make or not to make. The three effects (random, choice & non-choice) result in a continuum of life changing outcomes. Think of a constant branching of railroad tracks that carry our train-of-life (or think of continual coin flips guiding our decision making through out life). The film shows what happens when we make those choices and what happens when we choose to do nothing and let randomness (chance) butterfly (leaf) determine the outcome.The movie presents us two views from our central character and his decisions: One, as an older person remembering (or perhaps imagining) the outcomes of his life's choices. Second, as a young man imagining his future lifes' outcomes.The movie also presents us with two states of existence for those outcomes: The first is illusionary. The second, as some physicists believe, that the past, present and future do exist for all possible outcomes -  in an infinite ""number"" of parallel universes. We, as viewers, are to decide which is true or perhaps ""Every path is the right path.""Guide: The movie shows all three choices starting when Nemo was a young man.  Who he chooses to be his love for life. To make it easy to follow each choice of love-life-path they are each color and film technique coded. Red, yellow and blue for each female, and camera angles and focus differ for each female.A leaf in the movie is our stand-in butterfly.Kudos to the international cooperative approach in making the film: Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, UK, Canada, USA.My only science based disagreement is when the Universe reverses it's expansion (we are assuming a sudden disappearance of Dark Energy) that time, since it's interwoven with space, also reverses, i.e. rewinds (entropy becomes reconstructive) - not likely.

So, when you decide to make a decision a set of unchained events will undertake, but perhaps they are very related. Reality or existential fiction. In last instance, the destiny is the way you live.Of course, there have been many others related films, in which ""The butterfly effect"" the randomness and the destiny's trickeries are extremely united. A man close to death ponders the many lives he might have led in this fantasy from director and screenwriter Jaco van Dormael. 117-year-old Nemo Nobody (Jared Leto) is ill and facing his last days as he looks back on his past and a particular crucial moment -- at the age of nine, Nemo's parents divorced, and as his mother (Natasha Little) and father (Rhys Ifans) stood on a train platform, he had to choose who he would go with, and whether he would live in the United States or Great Britain. Either choice would bring with it a wide variety of possibilities regarding the sort of life he would lead, and Nemo imagines nearly all of them, including two different wives -- sweet but emotionally blank Jeanne (Linh-Dan Pham) and lovely but troubled Elise (Sarah Polley) -- and another woman, Anna (Diane Kruger), whom he loves but can not marry. But as Nemo considers the many different paths his life could have taken, his memory begins to fail him, and he finds it increasingly difficult to be certain which was his real life and which is a product of his imagination. Mr. Nobody also stars Thomas Byrne as nine-year-old Nemo and Toby Regbo as Nemo in his teenage years.The initial sequence is a marvelous tribute to 2001 Space Odyssey's last shots.  marvelous artistic, superb edition and magnificent performance of Jared Leto make this film a winner.

I was bored stiff the entire time. So far it is just a bunch of disjointed and uninteresting scenes that you could call a montage of mini boring scenes. The supposed sci fi angle to this of a society where people are nearly immortal had no real connection to the actual action in the movie, which so far is all boring flashbacks to a very regular life. Thus, any sci fi plot was nullified. This is not really sci fi.

I enjoyed the Ashton Kutcher old movie actually called ""The Butterfly Effect"" but it used the concept as a more simple plot device...though explaining it.  This actually walked you through it. And looking at Jared for that long was great, the younger actor they picked was a good choice too.  I wish the photo they used for the cover didn't make it look like a mad scientist movie.  They have him in a picture looking like mel brooks...or is it Gibson?  I almost didn't pick this on my Prime to watch!!! Lucky me!  Might be too confusing for teens but if you explain the ""Butterfly Effect"" they might get it's relationship to choices...though I'm not sure it was very clear in explaining. No matter the choice it always moves us forward in time in our reality.I thought the end was super creepy.  Imagine that being your life at the End...or was it?  Is it ever? or is it all a matter of perception as they suggest when the baby is born. Lots to think about.

Mr. Nobody, a film by Jaco Van Dormael, explores and reimagines this notion and the theory of the Arrow of Time: the idea that time moves in only one direction.A simplistic sketch of the film&#8217;s plot: By 2092 the world has moved on to become a futuristic utopia, but a dreary one. The cityscape is spotless, sterile. Sex between humans no longer exists. Obsessive organization and celebrity talk shows reign. 118 year-old Nemo Nobody, the last living mortal, the last human remnant of the old world recounts his life to a reporter.Nemo details his past as a series of fragments. He recounts them as if he were in fact choosing them in the way that we choose our future. It&#8217;s as if the past is being manipulated, riffed on, being made into a series of variations on a theme.&#8220;Why does the smoke never go back into the cigarette? Why do the molecules spread away from each other? Why does a spilled drop of ink never reform?&#8221;  As the laws of entropy take the universe further and further into a state of disarray what will happen when we hit maximum entropy? When total chaos bestills nothingness?Mr. Nobody is not exactly hot off the reels. It&#8217;s a 2009 film that was on my must watch list. Despite so many awesome elements, the cinematic culmination of Mr. Nobody was rather disappointing. Mostly, the scenes tended to drag on. This was 100 minutes worth of great material stretched over the course of 155 minutes. When the film flashes back to the various paths of Nemo&#8217;s past, much time is spent on creating aesthetically pleasing shots. This bogs the story down. It&#8217;s as if Van Dormael couldn&#8217;t decide what was more important, story, or aesthetics, and so some of these long-winded scenes feel contrived, as if the aesthetics served no purpose other than themselves. Beautiful cinema is great on it&#8217;s own, but with a storyline as complex as Mr. Nobody&#8217;s, the aesthetics should serve to support the plot and the characters, which at times, did not happen.Overall the film is still worth the watch.Get more at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",4,Great idea just a little to long,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,2196,"['past', 'Not', 'entity', 'where', 'contemporary', 'perceptions', 'tend', 'vary', 'What', '8217', 'done', 'done', 'right', 'Mr.', 'Nobody', 'film', 'Jaco', 'Van', 'Dormael', 'explores', 'reimagines', 'notion', 'theory', 'Arrow', 'Time', 'idea', 'time', 'moves', 'only', 'one', 'direction.A', 'simplistic', 'sketch', 'film', '8217', 'plot', '2092', 'world', 'moved', 'become', 'futuristic', 'utopia', 'dreary', 'one', 'cityscape', 'spotless', 'sterile', 'Sex', 'humans', 'no', 'longer', 'Obsessive', 'organization', 'celebrity', 'talk', 'reign', '118', 'year-old', 'Nemo', 'Nobody', 'last', 'living', 'mortal', 'last', 'human', 'remnant', 'old', 'world', 'life', 'reporter.Nemo', 'details', 'past', 'series', 'fragments', 'were', 'fact', 'choosing', 'way', 'choose', 'future', '8217', 'past', 'being', 'manipulated', 'riffed', 'being', 'made', 'series', 'variations', 'theme.', '8220', 'Why', 'smoke', 'never', 'go', 'back', 'cigarette', 'Why', 'do', 'molecules', 'spread', 'away', 'other', 'Why', 'spilled', 'drop', 'ink', 'never', 'reform', '8221', 'laws', 'entropy', 'take', 'universe', 'further', 'further', 'state', 'disarray', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'hit', 'maximum', 'entropy', 'When', 'total', 'chaos', 'bestills', 'nothingness', 'Mr', 'Nobody', 'not', 'exactly', 'reels', '8217', '2009', 'film', 'was', 'must', 'watch', 'list', 'so', 'many', 'awesome', 'elements', 'cinematic', 'culmination', 'Mr.', 'Nobody', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'Mostly', 'scenes', 'tended', 'drag', 'was', '100', 'minutes', 'great', 'material', 'stretched', 'course', '155', 'minutes', 'When', 'film', 'back', 'various', 'paths', 'Nemo', '8217', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'creating', 'aesthetically', 'pleasing', 'shots', 'story', 'down', '8217', 'Van', 'Dormael', 'couldn', '8217', 'decide', 'what', 'was', 'more', 'important', 'story', 'aesthetics', 'so', 'long-winded', 'scenes', 'feel', 'contrived', 'aesthetics', 'served', 'purpose', 'other', 'Beautiful', 'cinema', 'great', '8217', 'own', 'storyline', 'as', 'complex', 'Mr.', 'Nobody', '8217', 'aesthetics', 'should', 'serve', 'support', 'plot', 'characters', 'times', 'did', 'not', 'happen.Overall', 'film', 'still', 'worth', 'watch.Get', 'more', 'getthebonesaw.blogspot.com']",N/A

In fact, I had a such a hard time understanding it that I had to sit and watch the film repeatedly, till I more or less understood what was going on.It seems absurd to make such an effort to understand a feature film. Why then did I do it? The reason was that I enjoyed the film tremendously, even when I had no idea what was going on. It's woven together seamlessly - the sci-fi, the future, the past, voiceovers, hypnotic suggestions, music, leaves fluttering. It's a cinematic film. It's more than just a story put to pictures. Much more.Jared Leto is excellent, as are the child and teen actors, and the cinematography is wonderful.I'm not sure if the director is a genius who did tie things up perfectly, yet so far above our heads that many of us need to struggle to get it, or if the film missed the mark in some way. Perhaps something was amiss with its logic, some strands left loose. Even a dream has to make sense in its dream logic, otherwise it would be an inchoate mess. Mr. Nobody is about multiple realities, that may or may not have happened, and about dreams, within dreams, within dreams. It drifted up and down and sideways through the subconscious. And it almost made sense - just not quite.Despite these reservations, it's a wonderful film, filled to the brim with interesting, touching, exhilarating and beautiful moments.
