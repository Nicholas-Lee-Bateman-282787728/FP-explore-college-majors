190347,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,1573624837,Alistair McHarg,"[3, 15]","Poetry is the apotheosis of all literary forms; clarity and emotional honesty chiseled into words with incredible discipline, worked and reworked tirelessly until they communicate with elegance and precision.  The relentless clanging of A/B rhyme portrayed in Slam bears as much resemblance to poetry as female mud wrestling in Berlin nightclubs bears to ballet.But that's part of this film's larger tragedy.  Raymond Joshua, Saul Williams, seems like the highly intelligent, sensitive kid who, in a better world, could really go places.  But in his milieu rap is de rigueur, so his talents are wasted there, stifled by the astonishing limitations of the idiom.  (How many rhymes for MF are there?)  This said, Ray seems stunningly naive for a kid who grew up in the projects, his ""dream"" argument with Lauren, Sonja Sohn, late in the film, reflects worldly innocence a 12-year old might envy.  This ""man-child"" theme, worked overly hard, is in jarring juxtaposition to the gritty realism of the film's first half, a stark look inside prison life.No one in the film technically qualifies as an actor, and it shows.  (Marion Barry's legendary impersonation of a Mayor comes closest.)  This glaring deficiency is most evident when a prison guard delivers the movie's only memorable moment.  He is clearly untrained, but manages to summon what no one else can, conviction, authenticity, and passion.  In clearly defined terms, using a mathematical formula, he explains to Ray why he's so angry.  It's all about the number of young black men in his prison, and how disproportionate that number is when compared to Washington's overall demographic.  He breaks it down, and then expresses his pain felt witnessing the self-destructive cycle of drugs and street crime.  It is a sharp moment that neatly punctuates all the gassy, preachy speeches characterizing most of this film.What little chance the movie had of succeeding is lost completely in the third act, a bizarre blend of goopy love story and poetry slam funfest.  The poetry slam is especially poor, the poetry itself is shabby and the crowd seems to have been bussed in from another movie set.  Williams and Sohn are likeable, and do well considering their obvious lack of experience.  The fault here lies with the script and the director.  If Levin had played his cards right, he could have made one coherent, well structured lousy movie.  Instead, what he managed to do was chop together unrelated sections of three lousy movies.  The subject matter is serious and certainly deserved better than this.",2,Sham,1180742400,"06 2, 2007",2007,2558,"['Poetry', 'apotheosis', 'literary', 'forms', 'clarity', 'emotional', 'honesty', 'chiseled', 'words', 'incredible', 'discipline', 'worked', 'reworked', 'tirelessly', 'communicate', 'elegance', 'precision', 'relentless', 'clanging', 'A/B', 'rhyme', 'portrayed', 'Slam', 'bears', 'much', 'resemblance', 'poetry', 'female', 'mud', 'wrestling', 'Berlin', 'nightclubs', 'bears', 'ballet.But', 'part', 'film', 'larger', 'tragedy', 'Raymond', 'Joshua', 'Saul', 'Williams', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'kid', 'who', 'better', 'world', 'could', 'really', 'go', 'places', 'milieu', 'rap', 'de', 'rigueur', 'talents', 'are', 'wasted', 'there', 'stifled', 'astonishing', 'limitations', 'idiom', 'How', 'many', 'rhymes', 'MF', 'are', 'there', 'said', 'Ray', 'stunningly', 'naive', 'kid', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'projects', 'dream', 'argument', 'Lauren', 'Sonja', 'Sohn', 'late', 'film', 'worldly', 'innocence', '12-year', 'old', 'might', 'envy', 'man-child', 'theme', 'worked', 'overly', 'hard', 'jarring', 'juxtaposition', 'gritty', 'realism', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'stark', 'look', 'prison', 'life.No', 'one', 'film', 'technically', 'actor', 'Marion', 'Barry', 'legendary', 'impersonation', 'Mayor', 'closest', 'glaring', 'deficiency', 'most', 'evident', 'when', 'prison', 'guard', 'movie', 'only', 'memorable', 'moment', 'clearly', 'untrained', 'summon', 'what', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'conviction', 'authenticity', 'passion', 'clearly', 'defined', 'terms', 'using', 'mathematical', 'formula', 'Ray', 'why', 'so', 'angry', 'number', 'young', 'black', 'men', 'prison', 'how', 'disproportionate', 'number', 'when', 'compared', 'Washington', 'overall', 'demographic', 'down', 'then', 'pain', 'felt', 'witnessing', 'self-destructive', 'cycle', 'drugs', 'street', 'crime', 'sharp', 'moment', 'neatly', 'gassy', 'preachy', 'speeches', 'characterizing', 'most', 'film.What', 'little', 'chance', 'movie', 'had', 'succeeding', 'lost', 'completely', 'third', 'act', 'bizarre', 'blend', 'goopy', 'love', 'story', 'poetry', 'slam', 'funfest', 'poetry', 'slam', 'especially', 'poor', 'poetry', 'shabby', 'crowd', 'have', 'been', 'bussed', 'movie', 'set', 'Williams', 'Sohn', 'are', 'likeable', 'do', 'well', 'considering', 'obvious', 'lack', 'experience', 'fault', 'here', 'script', 'director', 'Levin', 'had', 'played', 'cards', 'right', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'one', 'coherent', 'well', 'structured', 'lousy', 'movie', 'Instead', 'what', 'managed', 'do', 'was', 'chop', 'together', 'unrelated', 'sections', 'three', 'lousy', 'movies', 'subject', 'matter', 'serious', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'better']",N/A

(Not surprising, since director Marc Levin is known for his documentary work.) With only a couple of exceptions, the actors in it are amateurs, which actually works to the film's advantage.Anyway, SLAM is a simple, sometimes dopey, sometimes thrilling story of a guy who winds up in jail, gets out, and might be heading right back in again. But both Saul Williams, the principal actor, and his love interest, Sonja Sohn (of THE WIRE) are real live poets, and man, does it show when they do their poetry readings... or ""slams"" as they are known.And I'll tell you what: SLAM has some scenes that will knock your socks off.There's one in particular where our protagonist avoids a fatal shanking in the prison yard by giving a dramatic reading of his poetry. One of his fellow felons says of the performance, ""I still don't know what that nigga  did, but it was fascinatin'."" That was pretty much my reaction, too.SIDENOTE: Yeah, that's crack smoker, prostitute patron, and former mayor of Washington, D.C. Marion Barry playing the judge.

190349,A20RQB3SXOQCGF,1573624837,Birdman,"[0, 0]","With the great resurgence of poetry jams and slams in our cities and schools, it's no wonder this wrenching movie has develped such a huge following.Saul Williams is phenomenal here, with a Shakespearean voice and an uncanny knack for freestyle. Because of a drug deal gone bad, Ray Joshua (Williams) is thrown into the criminal justice system for possession of 1/4 ounce of marijuana. He resists his plea bargain and rejects the judicial logic of trials. He is a fundamentally good person who cares for his neighbors and resists being another slave of the system.Sonja Sohn (of THE WIRE), his female lead, plays a former prostitute turned prison poetry workshop leader, and she is convincing indeed.  She has a fabulous screen presence and her character has an iron will that seems enmeshed with Ray's.While their eventual romance is predictable, it is also satisfying. The film's premise, simply that words have the power to redeem lives and heal deeply set wounds, has universal appeal. Those who have participated in jams and slams know this is true.Director, Mark Levin grainy, evocative cinematography, a drop-dead hip-hop score and steady pacing I have no idea why it sells for so little. I can only assume that the mass market has become so bovine in its tastes that many are unwilling to confront life on the other side of the fence, convinced that it simply does not exist.A superb, multiple-award-winner, thoughtfully-scripted and edited.

190350,A2TI8XP8GY1RO1,1573624837,DukeOfEarl,"[9, 9]","This was a pretty intense experience. I recently became a fan of Saul Williams, and I had to have this movie. It's a dark, yet learning experience for a man(Raymond Joshua) who gets sent to jail for possession, is hunted for on the inside, gets bailed out but realizes he's going right back. It seems like there are a lot of movies about prison and black folk, but this one was a little different.I thought Saul did quite a job for this being his first movie role. I think it's based in large part on his real-life self. Some of the acting was an eyesore, like the Chinese guy at the beginning, good God! A few of the other small parts were iffy, but I think the main characters, who are all pretty much unheard of, did fine. The best scenes to me were when Ray was about to get his ass kicked in the prison yard and he busted out with an exhilirating rap, and when Ray and the prisoner in the next cell were rhyming. The latter shows a contrast between two distinct rapping styles. The other guy was swearing up a storm kicking violent gangsta rhymes, while Ray's was intense, but loving, etheral, mystical, and mind-bending. The other guy's style represents what gets played the most on the radio and is popular, while Ray's embodies an 'underground' attitude and the style that Hiphop was created with. I am a huge Hiphop guru, and I prefer Ray's style, obviously.Otherwise, the movie leaves an impression, and gets you thinking about the ways of the inner-city lifestyle, as well as that in the prison. The poetry was what set this movie apart. Ray and the main female(forgot her name) perform at a poetry slam at the end of the movie. I wouldn't give this a five-star, but it's still good and worthwhile. I think it could have covered Ray's life more before he went to prison, and the ending kind-of left us hanging, or did it? I still don't understand what he was doing at the end. Like I said, ""Slam"" is a gritty, raw, uncut slice of the projects and the prison life. Cuss words are aplenty! It definitely hits it's points, and works well with the predominantly no-name cast. I liked the directing too. If you pass by this at the store and see it for a good price, go ahead, pick it up!

It was the time when hip hop and rap were slightly moving towards a new trend, slam which was poetry, oral (in fact written most of the time, at least in the poet's head) and uttered in public, to an audience without music. The only tool was at most a microphone.That's the film and its argument. A young chap meets another one in some down town area and when he is doing his business with him, that man he is meeting is shot in the head. He runs. The chap did not die and hence could testify the person he was speaking with and who ran was not the killer. The charge being dropped, naturally though this has nothing to do with nature, he is charged with the possession of some illegal substance, in that case some marihuana. That's how justice is in many cases. Everyone is not DSK.Prison while waiting for the court hearing or the paying of an important bail. The description is brutal and totally unrestricted on the violence and the circles of influence, though modest on some more ""intimate"" forced dealings. He is then noticed for his slam poetry in the yard one day and that gives him the possibility to get out on bail and to meet another slam poet, a woman this time who was teaching the inmates how to read literature and write creative pieces of their own.On the day before or two days before his court hearing that is going to send him back to prison for a small stunt of two years or so, he is able to have some direct discussion with the poetess he got acquainted to and she introduces him to a slam club downtown where he is able to perform to an audience for the first time.Then we are left with the suspended question of what he is going to do on Monday: go to the court hearing or run on his bail.The film has been heavily in favor of the first solution and not some magic door out. It is hard to be convicted for a minor crime as a police compensation for the major crime he was accused of but did not commit and could not be prosecuted for.Remember American justice does not look for the truth or justice itself. It looks for what can go through a court, i.e. get to a conviction, or what can get the local attorney reelected. Remember DSK. The facts are proved and reported including by a hospital report but there will be no trial because of some shady elements in the personality of the victim that may bring a jury to a non-guilty decision. So the culprit runs free though not cleared of the accusation that could not and did not go through court. A cleared culprit that will never be convicted nor tried.

Please, don't let race distinctions turn you away from this film.  &quot;Slam&quot; is one of the most noble uses of film I've seen in a long time.  It challenges and provokes and creates intense thought.  It is a ferociously intellectual movie, though not in a highbrow way.  It has the unique ability to present complex and daunting ideas in a way that makes them unusually comprehensible.  At the same time, it places a value on the process of writing and personal expression that has been woefully lost in the age of stuff-goes-boom movies.  The performances - especially by Saul Williams, Sonja Sohn, and Bonz Malone - are impeccable, and I'm not refering to just their dynamic slam poetry sessions, which are electrifying in a way that few passages of film are.
