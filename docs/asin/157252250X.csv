186824,A2EOFYRFB292KS,157252250X,"Alberto M. Barral ""NY LuxViewer""","[37, 39]","This film is great only for the visual details: It was shot on location so you actually get to see the interiors of the Ludwig castles: The bedroom at Linderhof, the throne room at Neuschwanstein, the hall of mirrors, which rivals Versailles' at Herrenchiemsee, and also the costumes are outstanding, particularly in the early part of the movie at Ludwigs's coronation wherre the trains, the tiara and the condecorations are all perfect, polished and in place. For this historical record alone, it is worth watching, and also because these castles were the lasting legacy of Ludwig to his people. The main flow of tourists to Bavaria for most of the 20th Century, and still today, is due to the existence of these magnificent creations. As much as the expenses were critiziced at the time, and used against him later in relation to his dethronement, it has paid off many times over as an investment in benefiting his people and I dare say in this respect he surpassed all of his ancestors.In another cultural contribution he also remains unsurpassed, though he has never been acknowledged as fully as he deserves: He is largely responsible for the greatest music composed in Germany at the time, namely his patronage of Richard Wagner was an ESSENTIAL part of the development of music and he alone was able to see it, and to insure that it not only survived, but flourished, a very difficult enterprise since Wagner had a knack for creating controversy and conjuring animosity.However here also the problems begin. There are a lot of important points in Ludwig's life that are not sufficiently clearly covered, which is not comprehensible in such a long film, for example we are never shown a performance of Wagner, as Ludwig had it done: With him completely alone in the theater and applauding from the Royal Box, which was not only historically correct, but would have highlighted both his eccentric personality and his strong determination for artistic patronage. Instead we see a theatrical performance, that looks like a rehersal and no Ludwig watching in the Royal Box. There is no scene that takes place in the Turkish Pavilion at Linderhof, which was one of Ludwig's favorite and most successful artistic creations. He often dressed in full Royal regalia for events at the Pavilion. There is also a very sketchy coverage of his affairs with men. The whole thing is 'suggested' more than it is stated. I found that for four hours of film footage and the fact that it was made in 1972, it should have have been more specific and detailed on this issue, which was after all, a major component of the king's life. More importantly, it should have been shown as a separate issue from his mental instability, which was obviously a hereditary problem, most particlularly because the two have been thrown together to maliciosuly denigrate the character of the king as 'decadent' , first by the clique that had a vested interested in deposing him, and ever since by the politics of repression and distorrtion that were applied to the historical record till the advancement of gay liberation in the last century was able to inform and clarify these readings .  Helmut Berger is absolutely riveting in his performance as Ludwig, his characterization is profound and convincing in every frame. Romy Schiender is wonderful as Ludwig's cousin, The Empress Elizabeth of Austria, with whom Ludwig was infatuated in the unique fashion that homosexual men have always idiolized, praised and showered adoration and  devotion unto divas and fabulous women who act like they are, through the centuries, and NOT in love with her as has been written in the past to purposely disguise and misconstrue the king's homosexuality. Trevor Howard is great as the manipulative, astute, and roguish Richard Wagner. Silvana Mangano was aptly decorative and restrained in her role as Cosima von Buelow, Wagner's mistress at the time.The only problem with the film, and it is a problem, is the length. Probably under the influence of Wagner, who was a great composer but lacked all sense of theatrical timing, Visconti has over extended the scenes to an unecessary degree that inevitably stimulate boredom and frustration in the viewer. I can not believe that some reviewers consider this extremely long 4 hours to be 'shortened' and if there is indeed a longer version, it should only come out with a warning in RED in the packaging.",3,Visual Elegy to the eccentric King,1249257600,"08 3, 2009",2009,4407,"['film', 'great', 'only', 'visual', 'details', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'actually', 'get', 'see', 'interiors', 'Ludwig', 'castles', 'bedroom', 'Linderhof', 'throne', 'room', 'Neuschwanstein', 'hall', 'mirrors', 'Versailles', 'Herrenchiemsee', 'also', 'costumes', 'are', 'outstanding', 'particularly', 'early', 'part', 'movie', 'Ludwigs', 'coronation', 'wherre', 'trains', 'tiara', 'condecorations', 'are', 'perfect', 'polished', 'place', 'historical', 'record', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching', 'also', 'castles', 'were', 'lasting', 'legacy', 'Ludwig', 'people', 'main', 'flow', 'tourists', 'Bavaria', 'most', '20th', 'Century', 'still', 'today', 'due', 'existence', 'magnificent', 'creations', 'As', 'much', 'expenses', 'were', 'critiziced', 'time', 'used', 'later', 'relation', 'dethronement', 'paid', 'off', 'many', 'times', 'over', 'investment', 'benefiting', 'people', 'dare', 'say', 'respect', 'surpassed', 'ancestors.In', 'cultural', 'contribution', 'also', 'unsurpassed', 'never', 'been', 'acknowledged', 'as', 'fully', 'largely', 'responsible', 'greatest', 'music', 'composed', 'Germany', 'time', 'namely', 'patronage', 'Richard', 'Wagner', 'was', 'ESSENTIAL', 'part', 'development', 'music', 'alone', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'insure', 'not', 'only', 'survived', 'flourished', 'very', 'difficult', 'enterprise', 'Wagner', 'had', 'knack', 'creating', 'controversy', 'conjuring', 'animosity.However', 'here', 'also', 'problems', 'begin', 'are', 'lot', 'important', 'points', 'Ludwig', 'life', 'are', 'not', 'sufficiently', 'clearly', 'covered', 'not', 'comprehensible', 'such', 'long', 'film', 'example', 'are', 'never', 'shown', 'performance', 'Wagner', 'Ludwig', 'had', 'done', 'completely', 'alone', 'theater', 'applauding', 'Royal', 'Box', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'historically', 'correct', 'would', 'have', 'highlighted', 'eccentric', 'personality', 'strong', 'determination', 'artistic', 'patronage', 'Instead', 'see', 'theatrical', 'performance', 'rehersal', 'Ludwig', 'watching', 'Royal', 'Box', 'scene', 'place', 'Turkish', 'Pavilion', 'Linderhof', 'was', 'one', 'Ludwig', 'favorite', 'most', 'successful', 'artistic', 'creations', 'often', 'dressed', 'full', 'Royal', 'regalia', 'events', 'Pavilion', 'also', 'very', 'sketchy', 'coverage', 'affairs', 'men', 'whole', 'thing', ""'suggested"", 'more', 'stated', 'found', 'four', 'hours', 'film', 'footage', 'fact', 'was', 'made', '1972', 'should', 'have', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'specific', 'detailed', 'issue', 'was', 'major', 'component', 'king', 'life', 'More', 'importantly', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'separate', 'issue', 'mental', 'instability', 'was', 'obviously', 'hereditary', 'problem', 'most', 'particlularly', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'thrown', 'together', 'maliciosuly', 'denigrate', 'character', 'king', ""'decadent"", 'first', 'clique', 'had', 'vested', 'interested', 'deposing', 'ever', 'politics', 'repression', 'distorrtion', 'were', 'applied', 'historical', 'record', 'till', 'advancement', 'gay', 'liberation', 'last', 'century', 'was', 'able', 'inform', 'clarify', 'readings', 'Helmut', 'Berger', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'performance', 'Ludwig', 'characterization', 'profound', 'convincing', 'frame', 'Romy', 'Schiender', 'wonderful', 'Ludwig', 'cousin', 'Empress', 'Elizabeth', 'Austria', 'whom', 'Ludwig', 'was', 'infatuated', 'unique', 'fashion', 'homosexual', 'men', 'have', 'always', 'idiolized', 'praised', 'showered', 'adoration', 'devotion', 'unto', 'divas', 'fabulous', 'women', 'who', 'act', 'are', 'centuries', 'NOT', 'love', 'been', 'written', 'past', 'purposely', 'disguise', 'misconstrue', 'king', 'homosexuality', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'great', 'manipulative', 'astute', 'roguish', 'Richard', 'Wagner', 'Silvana', 'Mangano', 'was', 'aptly', 'decorative', 'restrained', 'role', 'Cosima', 'von', 'Buelow', 'Wagner', 'mistress', 'time.The', 'only', 'problem', 'film', 'problem', 'length', 'Probably', 'influence', 'Wagner', 'who', 'was', 'great', 'composer', 'lacked', 'sense', 'theatrical', 'timing', 'Visconti', 'over', 'extended', 'scenes', 'unecessary', 'degree', 'inevitably', 'stimulate', 'boredom', 'frustration', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'reviewers', 'consider', 'extremely', 'long', '4', 'hours', 'be', ""'shortened"", 'indeed', 'longer', 'version', 'should', 'only', 'come', 'out', 'warning', 'RED', 'packaging']",Ludwig VHS
186825,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,157252250X,Alex Udvary,"[30, 33]","An absolute perfect film by craftsman Luchino Visconti about the &quot;Mad&quot; King of Bavaria, Ludwig the second, played flawlessly by Helmut Berger. We go thru Ludwig's entire reign as King up till the time when he meets the love of his life,Empress Elizabeth (Romy Schneider, who's performances deserved an Oscar nomination, her pressence brings a certain uniqueness to every scene), his associating with Richard Wagner (Trevor Howard), and his angagement to Sophie (Sonia Petrowa). Every scene in this movie is perfectly done. The acting is amazing and superb, the costume designs by Piero Tosi and the production designs by Mario Chiari and Mario Scisci are fantastic and beautiful. The musical score by Schunann, Wagner, and Offenbach complements each and every scene by adding the emotional impact on every scene. The cinematography by Armando Nannuzzi is masterful and dazzling. And of course the directing by Visconti is incredible. He setsup everything in a way only he can. The screenplay by Enrico Mediolo and Visconti is intriguing. I can't think one of bad thing about this film, every second of it is flawless. Even though it's about 4 hours, none of it is wasted. But, I'm afraid due to the lenght of the film, some may avoid seeing it. This is the same fate Bertolucci's &quot;1900&quot; suffered. Also, this isn't as widely known as other Visconti films such as &quot;The Leopard&quot;, &quot;Death In Venice&quot; and &quot;The Innocent&quot;. Which, I can't understand why. This movie, in my opinion, is better than all three movies I just mentioned! It's an embracive,heartfelt, bittersweet movie, that stands as one of the greatest of all time.

One feels pity for him throughout, with his Wagner obsession and his devotional love for his cousin, the famous empress Elisabeth of Austria. And Visconti delivered again a movie worthy of his fame.

186830,A280GY5UVUS2QH,157252250X,Doug Anderson,"[2, 5]","Ludwig is known to most of us as the Mad King of Bavaria who loved Wagner, spent extravagant sums building castles even though his country was going bankrupt and eventually was deposed by his countries ministers for his ineptness at matters of state and died tragically by drowning himself in a lake.  In the hands of Luchino Visconti this well known bit of history becomes a kind of parable of the high-minded artist living at odds with the rest of the world who care only for their material well being.  Its a little bit ridiculous to have this talentless boy king represent anything but a talentless boy king but its also gorgeous to look at. Luchino Visconti's Ludwig is sexually uninterested in women. Nonetheless he falls in love with his cousin Elizabeth(Romy Schneider) and who wouldn't. Elizabeth as played by Romy Schneider is something to behold. She is smart as a whip and playful and passionate and elegant and seems to intuitively understand how to make the most of her position in the world. Ludwig is only 19 when he takes the throne and is attracted to this creature who possesses all the qualities he does not. She is worldly and perfectly at ease with her position, he is a hopeless dreamer uncomfortable living within worldly dimensions and constantly longing for the impossible. At first he just seems naive but as he grows older he does not outgrow his dream-infused nature he simply cultivates it by building ever more extravagant castles with the vain hope of bringing these dreams to life. Recognizing in himself a notable lack of talent Ludwig becomes patron to Wagner in the hopes of bettering himself, this relationship and his relationship with other artists of his day lead only to disappointment for Ludwig is a hopeless and ineffective dilettante. Ultimately he becomes a recluse indulging in drink and fantasy very similar to the decadent poets which were the rage of the 1860's-1870's period in which Ludwig ruled. Visconti, who was himself an aristocrat, obviously sympathises with Ludwig and shares with Ludwig a love for ornate interiors. This isn't Visconti's only tale about a suffering artist with unusual sensual tastes, he covered this ground in Death in Venice. What makes Ludwig so unusual is that as leader of a nation he had vast sums of money at his disposal with which to indulge his tastes. Ironically even though he bankrupted the nation he was supposed to be ruling  he seems to have been a popular king. Ultimately his downfall coincides with Bavarias downfall and the beginning of the end of an era when one family (the Hapsburgs) ruled half of Europe. A beautiful film as all of Visconti's films are but this ones for art lovers not history lovers--Visconti obviously shares Ludwigs love of ""art"" and disdain for more practical matters like Prussia and Austria. A little more history would have given this film a little more muscle.

186831,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,157252250X,Edmonson,"[8, 9]","""Ludwig"" (1972) is the full version (237 min) of Luchino Visconti's film about the life of King Ludwig II of Bavaria. This King preferred the nights over the days and the film is subsequently filmed mostly at night. This pale skinned man living the life of a recluse in his castles created a sort of mythical image of himself.  Just as he lived in a sort of fantasy, disassociating himself from the affairs of the world around him it is mentioned that this King felt that the most important thing he could give to his people was to facilitate in the creation of beautiful things. Ludwig rebelled from his post as a king with its rigid rules of etiquette and decorum by seeking refuge in the the arts through his support of Wagner, actors, and the creation of his myriad number of castles.With the extremely dark palette Visconti seems to be referencing back to early horror films. It's not hard to imagine the pale gaunt King as a vampire of sorts. Ludwig preys on the the young men that he surrounds himself with. This is an interesting subtext given that Bram Stoker, the author of ""Dracula"", seemed to have an ambiguous relationship to the actor Henry Irving, whom he based the image of Dracula on. In another reference to early horror films Visconti depicts in the last scene men searching for Ludwig at night with their torches. This is reminiscent of the famous scene from ""Frankentein"" when the townsfolk are searching for the Frankenstein monster. The ambiguous portrayal of Ludwig, who is simultaneously shown as victim and predator,  and as a misunderstood outsider, perhaps reflects Visconti's ambivalent views about living in a Catholic society that ostracizes those whose sexual inclinations are outside of society's norms. Visconti also seems to be attracted and repelled by Ludwig, who was evidently quite a handsome man in his youth, but who is portrayed later in life like one of the living dead, with his pallid skin and mouth of decaying black teeth.This particular DVD set is in Italian with English subtitles, with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.

Even the VHS copy (which ran about 10 minutes shorter than this copy) was in the wrong aspect ratio (it was 1.85:1), and it cropped Visconti's excellent framing.  This DVD is in the proper ratio (2.35:1), it's at the proper length (there is no six hour version as some have said on this thread), and the transfer looks magnificent.This is a sad, poetic, elegaic film that has scenes which are often startling in their poetry and beauty.  Despite Ludwig's sheltered and indulgent life, he is vastly unhappy, indulging in fantasies and building extraordinary castles (many of which still remain in Bavaria).  Visconti portrays him with sympathy and empathy, and has made one of his greatest films.  Helmut Berger is excellent as Ludwig (Visconti had great taste in actors as well as lovers), Romy Schiender is wonderful as Ludwig's cousin (whom Ludwig loves), and Trevor Howard is great as Richard Wagner.  It has some of the most exquisite, painterly cinemtography in any Visconti films.  You really owe it to yourself to see this great film, whose reputation should soar after people see this DVD.The DVD has a few documentaries, including one called Luchino Visconti:  Life as in a Romance.  It's a rehash of a documentary that appeared on its own DVD called Luchino Visconti: A Portrait.  It's a poorly made, very short documentary, and doesn't even get close to the brilliance of Visconti or any of his works.  It's an extraordinarily superficial work.  The other documentaries are slighly more interesting, though I've seen better special features on DVD.  Regardless of the disappointing special features, the film Ludwig is worth watching and owning.  It's one of Visconti's most extraordinary films, arguably his last masterpiece.",5,"Visconti's magnificent epic, as good as The Leopard, lovingly restored....",1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,2106,"['Hooray', 'Koch', 'Lorber', 'decided', 'restore', 'magnificent', 'terribly', 'underrated', 'misunderstood', 'masterpiece', 'Luchino', 'Visconti', 'one', 'favorite', 'Italian', 'filmmakers', 'full', 'length', 'four', 'hour', 'version', 'When', 'was', 'released', 'here', 'states', 'initially', 'was', 'cut', 'almost', 'half', 'two', 'measly', 'hours', 'destroyed', 'Visconti', 'stately', 'pace', 'vision', 'Even', 'VHS', 'copy', 'ran', '10', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'copy', 'was', 'wrong', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'was', '1.85:1', 'cropped', 'Visconti', 'excellent', 'framing', 'DVD', 'proper', 'ratio', '2.35:1', 'proper', 'length', 'six', 'hour', 'version', 'have', 'said', 'thread', 'transfer', 'magnificent.This', 'sad', 'poetic', 'elegaic', 'film', 'scenes', 'are', 'often', 'startling', 'poetry', 'beauty', 'Ludwig', 'sheltered', 'indulgent', 'life', 'vastly', 'unhappy', 'indulging', 'fantasies', 'building', 'extraordinary', 'castles', 'many', 'still', 'remain', 'Bavaria', 'Visconti', 'sympathy', 'empathy', 'made', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'Helmut', 'Berger', 'excellent', 'Ludwig', 'Visconti', 'had', 'great', 'taste', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'lovers', 'Romy', 'Schiender', 'wonderful', 'Ludwig', 'cousin', 'whom', 'Ludwig', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'great', 'Richard', 'Wagner', 'most', 'exquisite', 'painterly', 'cinemtography', 'Visconti', 'films', 'really', 'owe', 'yourself', 'see', 'great', 'film', 'reputation', 'should', 'soar', 'people', 'see', 'DVD.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'documentaries', 'including', 'one', 'called', 'Luchino', 'Visconti', 'Life', 'Romance', 'rehash', 'documentary', 'appeared', 'own', 'DVD', 'called', 'Luchino', 'Visconti', 'Portrait', 'poorly', 'made', 'very', 'short', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'close', 'brilliance', 'Visconti', 'works', 'extraordinarily', 'superficial', 'work', 'other', 'documentaries', 'are', 'slighly', 'more', 'interesting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'Regardless', 'disappointing', 'special', 'features', 'film', 'Ludwig', 'worth', 'watching', 'owning', 'one', 'Visconti', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'films', 'arguably', 'last', 'masterpiece']",Ludwig VHS

Enough to be totally captivated by the man and his dedication to a life of art and music. For sure, he had many flaws like other leaders, but he was a man made for a future era and was born before his time. This Visconti film had tremendous potential to bring out the truth about this famous eccentric who was in love with the night and was only interested in building castles to fill a romantic vision of Germanic mythology. Unfortunately it fails to communicate properly about the man to the audience. The actor chosen for the role, Helmut Berger, was good. The potential was there, but it falls short. I was much more intrigued by the scenes of Ludwig that were filmed for Richard Burton's &quot;Wagner&quot;, and in those short glimpses we understood much more about Ludwig than you will discover in this long film. Especially helpful were the scenes that showed discussions between staffers under Ludwig's employ and the plotting of greedy people. &quot;Wagner&quot; came close but was limited because it was after all a movie about Wagner's whole life. This attempt from 1970 started on the right track with location scenery but appears to be disconnected regarding scenes of Ludwig's life leaving us out of the plot. So much so that to some it appears to be a lot of dark photography of a brooding Ludwig hiding in his castle until the guards come to place him under arrest.

The gradual deterioration and dethronement of Ludwig is very well represented.The question as to whether Ludwig is a genius or a madman- or a combination of both- is handled sensitively and intelligently. The portrayal of his enduring love of his cousin (Romy Schneider in one of her finest and most controversial roles) is excellent, as is the portrayalof the wily genius, Richard Wagner, by Trevor Howard, Ludwig, played adroitly by Helmet Berger. is victimized by a lack of royal mentoring and the very common inbreeding that often afflicted European royalty. All in all, the historical representation is enlightening as exemplified by the backdrop of Bismark's consolidation of the disparate German kingdoms into modern Germany in 1870. I was ALSO impressed by the representations of Ludwig's castle without rooms, and his underground grotto with swan boots in a spring. The film gets pretty bizarre at times, and the ending in particularly puzzling and strangely justified.I've seen this four times and each time I find something new and interesting. On the other hand, the film is long with subtitles which may turn off much of the American audience. I feel this movie is most like another Visconti masterpiece ""The Leopard."" which also depicts thedemise of the preeminence of European monarchies in the nineteenth century.
