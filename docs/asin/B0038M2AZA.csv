1332060,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0038M2AZA,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","This is one of the HBO feature-length films that keep nagging at me to get a TV with HBO and History Channel and a few other good things.As most people know by now, Temple Grandin was diagnosed with autism at the age of four. The doctor who diagnosed her pronounced it like a life sentence. Her mother was simply not having any of this ""put her in an institution"" (implied: and forget about her), and gradually adapted home-schooling methods to her needs. We see the boarding high school and how others came to accept her -- or not -- and her college. But the most interesting part comes after she realizes what she wants to do is study animal husbandry, in part because she found a high level of rapport with the animals on her aunt's ranch when she spent the summer there between high school and college.Temple was not only brilliant, but lucky. She had a few teachers and other mentors who showed up at the right times to give her a chance. Not that there weren't problems; there were plenty. One big one was that her stock handling designs were revolutionary, built to reduce the stress and fear in the animals right up to the moment of slaughter. The ignorance and, in some cases, wanton cruelty of some of the stock handlers was appalling.Her first really original design was for a dipping system where cattle could be put into a flea bath without trauma, and swim quite placidly to the other end, climb out on their own, and not drown or panic or cause problems for the handlers. She demonstrated it for a stockman's journalist the day before the official showing, and it worked beautifully. The writer was very impressed, and wrote a very favorable article. But the next day, which was supposed to be the regular press briefing and demonstration, the stock handlers changed her design in all the wrong ways before she even arrived on the scene. They completely ruined it, so that the only record of the real design was in the magazine article by the guy who had seen it the day before.When she came to apply her principles to the animals heading into the slaughter house, she also encountered resistance. The first argument, predictably, was that it would be too expensive. But she stood up to them and pointed out all the ways they would save money in the long run, and eventually they bought into the ideas.The last scene may indeed be the best. Temple and her mother go to an Autism conference, and in typical Temple manner, she spoke up to correct a speaker's blatant error. Someone naturally asked her how old her child was, and when she said she didn't have any children, they smirked on the assumption that she had no idea what she was talking about. But when she began to tell her story, including the fact that she had both a bachelor's and master's degree, and was working on a doctorate, they wanted to hear everything.This wonderful woman is a living testament to the idea that we must take people seriously for their abilities and their spirit, not dismiss them as a diagnosis. She's used her autism to her advantage in many ways, and to the advantage of animals everywhere, and the people who love them and the people who eat them. As she says several times in the film, ""Nature is cruel, but there's no reason we have to be.""",5,Dr. Grandin is Brilliantly Portreyed,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,3248,"['one', 'HBO', 'feature-length', 'films', 'keep', 'nagging', 'get', 'TV', 'HBO', 'History', 'Channel', 'few', 'other', 'good', 'things.As', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'now', 'Temple', 'Grandin', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'autism', 'age', 'four', 'doctor', 'who', 'diagnosed', 'pronounced', 'life', 'sentence', 'mother', 'was', 'simply', 'not', 'having', 'put', 'institution', 'implied', 'forget', 'gradually', 'adapted', 'home-schooling', 'methods', 'needs', 'see', 'boarding', 'high', 'school', 'how', 'others', 'came', 'accept', 'not', 'college', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'what', 'do', 'study', 'animal', 'husbandry', 'part', 'found', 'high', 'level', 'rapport', 'animals', 'aunt', 'ranch', 'when', 'spent', 'summer', 'high', 'school', 'college.Temple', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'brilliant', 'lucky', 'had', 'few', 'teachers', 'other', 'mentors', 'who', 'showed', 'up', 'right', 'times', 'give', 'chance', 'Not', 'were', ""n't"", 'problems', 'were', 'plenty', 'One', 'big', 'one', 'was', 'stock', 'handling', 'designs', 'were', 'revolutionary', 'built', 'reduce', 'stress', 'fear', 'animals', 'right', 'up', 'moment', 'slaughter', 'ignorance', 'cases', 'wanton', 'cruelty', 'stock', 'handlers', 'was', 'appalling.Her', 'first', 'really', 'original', 'design', 'was', 'dipping', 'system', 'where', 'cattle', 'could', 'be', 'put', 'flea', 'bath', 'trauma', 'quite', 'placidly', 'other', 'end', 'out', 'own', 'not', 'drown', 'panic', 'cause', 'problems', 'handlers', 'demonstrated', 'stockman', 'journalist', 'day', 'official', 'showing', 'worked', 'beautifully', 'writer', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'wrote', 'very', 'favorable', 'article', 'next', 'day', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'regular', 'press', 'briefing', 'demonstration', 'stock', 'handlers', 'changed', 'design', 'wrong', 'ways', 'even', 'arrived', 'scene', 'completely', 'ruined', 'only', 'record', 'real', 'design', 'was', 'magazine', 'article', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'day', 'came', 'apply', 'principles', 'animals', 'heading', 'slaughter', 'house', 'also', 'encountered', 'resistance', 'first', 'argument', 'predictably', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'expensive', 'stood', 'up', 'pointed', 'out', 'ways', 'would', 'save', 'money', 'long', 'run', 'eventually', 'bought', 'ideas.The', 'last', 'scene', 'may', 'indeed', 'be', 'best', 'Temple', 'mother', 'go', 'Autism', 'conference', 'typical', 'Temple', 'manner', 'spoke', 'up', 'correct', 'speaker', 'blatant', 'error', 'Someone', 'naturally', 'asked', 'how', 'old', 'child', 'was', 'when', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'children', 'smirked', 'assumption', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'talking', 'when', 'began', 'tell', 'story', 'including', 'fact', 'had', 'bachelor', 'master', 'degree', 'was', 'working', 'doctorate', 'wanted', 'hear', 'everything.This', 'wonderful', 'woman', 'living', 'testament', 'idea', 'must', 'take', 'people', 'seriously', 'abilities', 'spirit', 'not', 'dismiss', 'diagnosis', 'used', 'autism', 'advantage', 'many', 'ways', 'advantage', 'animals', 'everywhere', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'people', 'who', 'eat', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'Nature', 'cruel', 'reason', 'have', 'be']",N/A

1332069,A7MFR0IDUM1ZU,B0038M2AZA,Carolyn J. Mears,"[2, 3]","It's always inspiring - and humbling - to see someone overcome great odds with native-intelligence and courage. Even though afflicted with autism, Temple Grandin thought her life ought to count for something. And she made it happen - on both personal and professional levels. Supported at-arm's-length by her mother's love and wisdom and encouraged by others close to her, Temple battled her way though high-school, then college; eventually earning not only a Ph.D. but the admiration and gratitude of countless people dealing with autism. Using unique abilities bestowed/burdened upon her by autism, she envisioned equipment and processes that would allow beef cattle to live without fear or discomfort right up to the second they ""leave"" (to wherever they go when their bodies become simply beef).

She should be the Kate Hepburn of our era, but alas....In this HBO Films presentation, Claire takes on the title role of autistic professor Temple Grandin, a lady I nearly ran into up in Fort Collins, Colorado, and who awarded me the privilege of reading one of my manuscripts. A very fine, capable person.Claire Danes reaches into some strange places to play Dr. Grandin--the semblance is spooky. Never have I seen such an uncanny biographical performance. She speaks with the same grating shout, suffers through the same mannerisms and the whole (briefly told) story of Dr. Grandin's childhood is well presented.It is a shame this film did not move beyond the time period it represents: when Dr. Grandin published her book ""Emergence: Labeled Autistic"", she was panned as a fraudster who had no idea what autism was. Experts the world over wound up with egg on their faces thanks to Dr. Grandin, though of course no one person can be the universal voice of any illness or condition. Danes shows just how hard it is simply to live life in accordance with normal rules, which Dr. Grandin learned to mould into her own rules of engagement.David Strathairn, whom I love, turns in a fine little-bit-more-than-cameo as one of Grandin's early teachers, Professor Carlock. Catherine O'Hara, in an unusual dramatic turn, plays Dr. Grandin's Aunt Ann beautifully, and Julia Ormond is very palatable as well. No shortage of talent here.I originally awarded this 3 stars, because I did not like the facile, dismissive tone of the thing. Grandin had a most unpleasant childhood and a rough pre- and post-adolescent life; this film hints at very little of that. VERY little. In deference to the actual discrepancy, I have changed my rating to four stars. It shows very little of her college life, and her interesting concept of ""Sins of the System"" should have at least been mentioned.What is here is solid, meat-n-potatoes work as I like to call it, with straightforward cinematography and a well-matched soundtrack. Though the makers didn't torture us with what-it's-like-to-be-autistic, they do a marvelous job showing us pictorial thinking. Viewers will love Grandin's thinking and invention processes. Also penetrating is a look into the slaughterhouse industry as it was decades ago, and how Dr. Grandin changed it overnight. She's even contributed to better kosher slaughtering procedure.Get this interesting, gently paced film and pay attention.

1332102,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0038M2AZA,Grady Harp,"[8, 9]","TEMPLE GRANDIN has a committed following group of admirers of fine film making: the reason the group is not larger is that this little film is a 'made for TV' movie and that at times puts it into the 'inconsequential' category in people's minds.  Nothing could be further from the truth. The film deals with autism in an honest, extremely sympathetic and intelligent way.  While there have been other films that deal with the various forms of autistic behavior ('Adam', 'Rainman', 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape', I am Sam', 'The Other Sister', 'Forest Gump', 'Little Man Tate' to name a few of the better known ones), few succeed on the level of this beautifully written adaptation of autobiographical books by the title character Dr. Temple Grandin (adapted by Christopher Monger and Merritt Johnson). It is fearless in its discussion of autism and for once shows how the autistic mind can function (for Temple, it functions in pictures and leads to a highly successful career as a scientist) in a manner that can be an incredible resource for mankind.  It simply works on every level, much to the sensitivity of director Mick Jackson who seems to understand the complexities of the mind of the central character as well as the responses of all of the ancillary characters.Claire Danes BECOMES Temple Grandin, so fine is her acting and her ability to bring the audience (and the cast of characters) into the inner workings of the autistic mind.  It is an astonishing performance of a mute four year old girl encouraged by her mother (Julia Ormond), her aunt (Catherine O'Hara), and one particular science teacher Professor Carlock (David Strathairn) who teaches her that doors (a common thread throughout the film) are meant to be opened because opportunity lies beyond.  How Temple progresses from special schools, learns to build a hugging machine that supplies the lack of embraces she apparently missed as a child, and becomes obsessed with the inhumane treatment of cattle in her observations of ranches and slaughter houses in Arizona, leads her to earning not only a college degree, but also a Masters and a PhD in Animal Husbandry.  Throughout the movie Claire Danes maintains her character's idiosyncrasies and her reaction to the frightening world around her with such credibility that she takes us with her on a journey of understanding the miracles that can happen with the minds of autistic people: no one thinks outside the box in a more positive manner than does Temple Grandin.  This is a beautifully made film on every level and one that should be required viewing for all people.

1332104,A2TS040W2FW5O,B0038M2AZA,Heidi Anne Heiner,"[5, 5]","This past Sunday, I sat down with my parents and my husband, John, to watch Temple Grandin. I had bought the movie a few months ago after reading the great reviews but kept putting off watching it for various reasons, including thinking it would be too heavy for a depressing winter day. My curiosity finally peaked and despite the family's slight reluctance, we started it relatively late in the evening. I fully expected John and my mother to fall asleep by the halfway point as they are both notorious for letting movies lull them asleep on a quiet evening.By the end of the movie--everyone was fully awake--we were all invigorated and discussing what we had just watched, staying up past our usual departure times. Everyone in the room enjoyed it and all of us have been discussing it since. It is easily one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Yes, it deals with serious matters but it doesn't weigh you down with them, infuses hope and understanding and even some tolerance that inspires. It is wonderfully visual and conveys autism, especially Grandin's, in a lucid manner. Clare Danes deserved her Emmy and Golden Globe despite the cliche of portraying someone with a disability which Hollywood always rewards. Julia Ormond (so good to see her again) and Catherine O'Hara were also excellent along with David Straithairn whose role wasn't a push for him but he does it so well that I always love him, too.So I wanted to recommend the movie to you. See it if you haven't. It's gotten some press, but not nearly enough since it was made for TV. It isn't rated but would merit somewhere between a PG and PG-13 for subject matter. After all, this is about slaughterhouses, too. Grandin is in part responsible for the better treatment of animals that will eventually become a food source. Read more about her online if you are interested, but don't let that subject matter scare you away as I almost did. It is discreet in handling those matters and doesn't try to shock or repel while still telling the story of someone's struggles with being different, very different, but with a big contribution to make to our world.

Temple Grandin is a high-functioning autistic who is able to communicate why she has the reactions she has, the feelings she feels, the physical adaptions she takes (such as spinning, rocking and avoiding eye contact), and how she thinks (she thinks in pictures and therefore does not do well at all with abstract thinking).  It is fascinating to see her fall to pieces and understand exactly what she is feeling and why.  Her mother is instrumental in helping her achieve to the highest level of education...a doctorate!  Temple is the best in her field of designing slaughterhouses that keep the animals calm and happy up to the last minute.  She completely understands the animals and is able to translate that into improving slaughterhouses world-wide.  You can see how and why interpersonal relationships are so difficult, if not impossible, for her...but the few people she is able to connect with manage to help her understand us and how to maneuver through the world so much better.

Animals, animal husbandry, women in cattle country, autism, engineering, the scientific method, animal behavior...I could go on and on. I have learned so much about so many things that I will be reading spin-off books based on this film for a long time.I was entranced by this very intelligent handling of a life that stands as a model for those who are different in mind and body from most of us. The intricate visual approach to autistic sensitivity, and the demonstration (rather than explanation) of the coping mechanisms that enabled Dr. Grandin to achieve what she has, are absolutely stunning. I've read the book, and this is a wonderful experience that enhanced rather than replaced the reading. If you loved this movie, by all means read ""Emergence""!I must also mention the remarkable scenes with cattle and horses, demonstrating Temple's gift of understanding the behavioral cues given by the animals, which most of us never see. Temple actually enters the mind of the animal, allowing us to see as the animal does, and understand why they behave as they do. Rest assured that there are absolutely no scenes that would be considered disturbing to animal lovers (such as myself) in spite of the nature of her work in the cattle industry. I had many ""aha"" moments, and no look at my dog a little closer when she wants something and I do not understand.Clair Danes disappears into the role, she has so taken on the persona of Temple Grandin...an Oscar effort for sure! Her work is a stunning example of the craft of acting.Do not miss the extra DVD feature, ""The Making of Temple Grandin"". Not only will you see footage of Dr. Grandin herself, you will understand how Director Mick Jackson decided to approach the difficult task of making her thought processes acessible to the audience within the film. His approach presents the autistic mind as a an intellectual asset, rather than a defect. He also uses this extra feature as a means to assure the audience that the animals in the film were either animatronic robots or actors, and suffered no trauma in the filming. A thoughtful touch.Anyone who knows someone with Aspergers in particular will benefit from watching this film. They will understand much more about the inner life of Aspys and be less afraid of the social impairments and perhaps more understanding of the intellectual gifts that are the other side of Aspergers.",5,"Animal lovers, you must watch this film!!",1286064000,"10 3, 2010",2010,2560,"['First', 'foremost', 'need', 'emphasize', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'difficult', 'isolate', 'separate', 'strands', 'knowledge', 'acquire', 'viewing', 'Animals', 'animal', 'husbandry', 'women', 'cattle', 'country', 'autism', 'engineering', 'scientific', 'method', 'animal', 'behavior', 'could', 'go', 'have', 'learned', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'will', 'be', 'reading', 'spin-off', 'books', 'based', 'film', 'long', 'time.I', 'was', 'entranced', 'very', 'intelligent', 'handling', 'life', 'model', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'mind', 'body', 'most', 'intricate', 'visual', 'approach', 'autistic', 'sensitivity', 'demonstration', 'rather', 'explanation', 'coping', 'mechanisms', 'enabled', 'Dr.', 'Grandin', 'achieve', 'what', 'are', 'absolutely', 'stunning', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'enhanced', 'rather', 'replaced', 'reading', 'loved', 'movie', 'means', 'read', 'Emergence', 'must', 'also', 'mention', 'remarkable', 'scenes', 'cattle', 'horses', 'demonstrating', 'Temple', 'gift', 'understanding', 'behavioral', 'cues', 'given', 'animals', 'most', 'never', 'see', 'Temple', 'actually', 'mind', 'animal', 'allowing', 'see', 'animal', 'understand', 'why', 'behave', 'do', 'Rest', 'assured', 'are', 'absolutely', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'disturbing', 'animal', 'lovers', 'such', 'spite', 'nature', 'work', 'cattle', 'industry', 'had', 'many', 'aha', 'moments', 'look', 'dog', 'little', 'closer', 'when', 'something', 'do', 'not', 'understand.Clair', 'Danes', 'disappears', 'role', 'so', 'taken', 'persona', 'Temple', 'Grandin', 'Oscar', 'effort', 'sure', 'work', 'stunning', 'example', 'craft', 'acting.Do', 'not', 'miss', 'extra', 'DVD', 'feature', 'Making', 'Temple', 'Grandin', 'Not', 'only', 'will', 'see', 'footage', 'Dr.', 'Grandin', 'will', 'understand', 'how', 'Director', 'Mick', 'Jackson', 'decided', 'approach', 'difficult', 'task', 'making', 'thought', 'acessible', 'audience', 'film', 'approach', 'autistic', 'mind', 'intellectual', 'asset', 'rather', 'defect', 'also', 'extra', 'feature', 'means', 'assure', 'audience', 'animals', 'film', 'were', 'either', 'animatronic', 'robots', 'actors', 'suffered', 'trauma', 'filming', 'thoughtful', 'touch.Anyone', 'who', 'someone', 'Aspergers', 'particular', 'will', 'benefit', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'understand', 'much', 'more', 'inner', 'life', 'Aspys', 'be', 'less', 'afraid', 'social', 'impairments', 'perhaps', 'more', 'understanding', 'intellectual', 'gifts', 'are', 'other', 'side', 'Aspergers']",N/A

Autism impairs the ability to communicate well and express feelings, which is why we don't typically get a good idea of how someone in the spectrum thinks and feels. This is an irony that further complicates a complex disorder. Through media like this film and books (i.e. Nobody Nowhere), &#34;normal&#34; people are able to learn about Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) from folks like Temple that are high functioning and able to communicate effectively.Although Temple is high functioning, the film is excellent for anyone who deals with Autism. I have an Autistic boy, and I have taken it upon myself to learn as much as possible, and this film has helped. Seeing Temple's live lectures is also a great opportunity if you haven't seen her in person.

1332125,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B0038M2AZA,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[50, 50]","This is an absolutely well done and quite inspiring movie. It isn't sentimental and Claire Danes does a superb job as Temple Grandin (in fact, I didn't even recognize her at first) as does David Strathairn as the integral teacher who helped Temple transition from home to school and also advocated for her when other teachers were skeptical.It is worth noting, early on, that viewers can opt to hear the actual Temple Grandin, not the actress, describing her reaction to every scene of the movie. We watched it both ways and each has so much to offer. Temple's reaction to the movie is very engaging. Now more about the movie....Claire Danes,in her role as Temple, shows how challenging every part of life could be for someone with autism,from childhood on. I hope this one goes far to help people understand the enigma that is autism and to stop fearing someone who looks and acts so differently. I am especially in awe of how the director and actors didn't sugar coat the realities of autism. I watched this with one son who asked, ""What is wrong with her?"" and came away from the movie with a new understanding of autism.Every part of this movie reveals a new challenge for Temple and that makes it riveting. She has trouble adapting to the smallest changes. She doesn't like to be touched. Going through doors, especially automatic ones, is terrifying. Other students in college tease her. Again, Claire Danes shines in her role, never breaking character. This movie belongs in the library of anyone who has an autistic child, teachers of special ed students and anyone who wants to watch a superb film.However (and I still believe this movie deserves a 5 star review), I have a few quibbles, minor ones. I do think both parents of autistic children and others need to realize that Temple is what is called ""high functioning."" Even so, she might never have gotten so far without the support of her mother and others who weren't put off by her behavior.But not every autistic child can do the same, in spite of their parents' best efforts, in spite of the best treatments possible, in spite of thinking outside the box. If this movie causes people to feel that every autistic child can - or,even worse, MUST -reach Grandin's level, then they don't realize that research into causes and treatments for autism are still evolving.Everyone wants those with autism to succeed and be accepted but parents of an autistic child should never feel guilty if their child doesn't become as successful as Grandin. As long as it doesn't induce that kind of guilt, the movie stands on its own as a portrait of a very remarkable woman.This movie is inspiring because it shows that some autistic children can learn to function in ""our"" world even though they see the world in a very different way or as the Temple of the movie says, ""Different ....but not less than."" What an apt way to describe what every one of us who has or knows an autistic child would wish!Since autism covers both high functioning and low functioning children, the prognosis for some autistic children is not necessary as hopeful as that of Temple Grandin. Temple became a respected expert in livestock behavior. Some autistic children may not get that far, through no fault on anyone's part.I have some experience with this. We had a child who was called ""autistic"" even though we didn't adopt him until he was older. He rocked, flapped his arms, didn't seem too engaged with people, etc. However, his ""autism"" was caused by being raised in an institution for 5 years. Now he behaves like any child his age. At the SAME time, others who were adopted at his age never grew out of their autistic behavior. They remained locked inside their minds even though their parents tried every bit as hard as we did to help those children. Their children are still diagnosed as autistic and behave no differently than many autistic children. They do not engage with other people. They rock. They have tantrums if anything in their environment changes.Point being: the brain is mysterious and so is autism. Whatever its cause, it has varying degrees of severity, depending on the child. So by all means, watch this move and be inspired by it. But do not take it as a promise that any child with autism will become a Temple Grandin.I plan to have several copies of this one, some to hand out because the movie is simply that wonderful.",5,"A must see!

Her mother had the great misfortune, not of suffering because of a ""disabled"" child, but of suffering through medical and ""mental health"" professionals with wrong-headed and blaming attitudes.  TG was born in 1950, and the prevailing professional attitude of the times was that the affliction of autism was caused by ""cold, non-nurturing  mothers"" who fail to bond with the child.  A child diagnosed as autistic (called ""infantile schizophrenia"" in those days!) was thought to be ""hopeless""; and the best solution was believed to be to institutionalize and forget about the child. Well, fortunately for Temple and the rest of the world, her mother KNEW that she did not cause her daughter's autism, and furthermore, she knew that her daughter was bright. Just how bright she was would be revealed as Temple's mom pushed her to learn and to go beyond her comfort zone, and, as the film has it, she learned to think, ""It's just another door. I can go through it.""The film focuses quite a bit on Temple's school years, through the private boarding school in NH (where her science teacher becomes her advocate and mentor), to her victory in graduating from college (after seriously resisting attending), on to get a master's in animal science from Arizona State U. (where it is so hot that she couldn't believe that people live there!), and beyond. Obviously Temple does learn to talk and to function in the world of people, but she is still more at home in the world of animals. She bonds with the horses at her private school, and then goes on to focus on cattle (her favorite animal) and the humane treatment of beef cattle.Much of the film focuses on her development of a ""squeeze machine""; a self-comforting devise she designs after she saw how cattle calmed down when herded into a mechanism that encloses the cow into a mechanical holding devise. Autistic people are normally unable to tolerate human touch, and have sensory issues in general.  But TG is impressed by the calming effect of the simple machine, she goes on to construct her personal ""hug machine"".  It turns out to be quite an uphill battle to get the authorities at school to let her keep one in her room.The movie shows how, despite the extreme social difficulties of high school, and TG's love of living and working at her aunt's ranch--and sameness in general--her mother helps her see going forward to college and beyond as ""just another door to go through.""  In this manner, she imagines each major step literally as a door she could walk through, and she manages to do so.I really enjoyed this movie, and not only is it a great introduction to Temple Grandin and her work, but I think it is a profound statement about the value of the individual who is ""different"".",5,"""A Door Opened, and I went through it""",1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,2883,"['Temple', 'Grandin', 'professor', 'renowned', 'consultant', 'beef', 'industry', 'author', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'speak', 'word', 'turned', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'mother', 'had', 'great', 'misfortune', 'not', 'suffering', 'disabled', 'child', 'suffering', 'medical', 'mental', 'health', 'professionals', 'wrong-headed', 'blaming', 'attitudes', 'TG', 'was', 'born', '1950', 'prevailing', 'professional', 'attitude', 'times', 'was', 'affliction', 'autism', 'was', 'caused', 'cold', 'non-nurturing', 'mothers', 'who', 'fail', 'bond', 'child', 'child', 'diagnosed', 'autistic', 'called', 'infantile', 'schizophrenia', 'days', 'was', 'thought', 'be', 'hopeless', 'best', 'solution', 'was', 'believed', 'be', 'institutionalize', 'forget', 'child', 'Well', 'fortunately', 'Temple', 'rest', 'world', 'mother', 'KNEW', 'did', 'not', 'cause', 'daughter', 'autism', 'furthermore', 'knew', 'daughter', 'was', 'bright', 'Just', 'how', 'bright', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'revealed', 'Temple', 'mom', 'pushed', 'learn', 'go', 'comfort', 'zone', 'film', 'learned', 'think', 'just', 'door', 'can', 'go', 'film', 'quite', 'bit', 'Temple', 'school', 'years', 'private', 'boarding', 'school', 'NH', 'where', 'science', 'teacher', 'advocate', 'mentor', 'victory', 'graduating', 'college', 'seriously', 'resisting', 'attending', 'get', 'master', 'animal', 'science', 'Arizona', 'State', 'U', 'where', 'so', 'hot', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'people', 'live', 'there', 'Obviously', 'Temple', 'learn', 'talk', 'function', 'world', 'people', 'still', 'more', 'home', 'world', 'animals', 'bonds', 'horses', 'private', 'school', 'then', 'focus', 'cattle', 'favorite', 'animal', 'humane', 'treatment', 'beef', 'cattle.Much', 'film', 'development', 'squeeze', 'machine', 'self-comforting', 'devise', 'saw', 'how', 'cattle', 'calmed', 'down', 'when', 'herded', 'mechanism', 'cow', 'mechanical', 'holding', 'devise', 'Autistic', 'people', 'are', 'normally', 'unable', 'tolerate', 'human', 'touch', 'have', 'sensory', 'issues', 'general', 'TG', 'impressed', 'calming', 'effect', 'simple', 'machine', 'construct', 'personal', 'hug', 'machine', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'uphill', 'battle', 'get', 'authorities', 'school', 'let', 'keep', 'one', 'room.The', 'movie', 'how', 'extreme', 'social', 'difficulties', 'high', 'school', 'TG', 'love', 'living', 'working', 'aunt', 'ranch', 'sameness', 'general', 'mother', 'see', 'going', 'forward', 'college', 'just', 'door', 'go', 'manner', 'major', 'step', 'literally', 'door', 'could', 'walk', 'do', 'so.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'introduction', 'Temple', 'Grandin', 'work', 'think', 'profound', 'statement', 'value', 'individual', 'who', 'different']",N/A

1332129,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0038M2AZA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","In the realm of made-for-TV movies, there is no question that HBO has been leading the way with critically acclaimed and Emmy nominated fare within recent years.  Take 2010, for example, with HBO's ""The Pacific"" ruling in the mini-series category--three other HBO productions were left battling it out in the film subdivision.  ""You Don't Know Jack,"" a Barry Levinson biopic about assisted-suicide maverick Jack Kevorkian, netted 15 Emmy nominations and won Al Pacino a statue as Best Actor.  ""Temple Grandin,"" another biopic--this one about the autistic Grandin who became a pioneer in animal husbandry--also garnered 15 nods and was the night's big winner.  In addition to Outstanding Made For Television Movie, it won Best Actress for Claire Danes as well as supporting statuettes for David Strathairn and Julia Ormond.  And finally, there was ""The Special Relationship,"" depicting the bond between Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, which was a bridesmaid with five nominations and no wins.  All in all, a good showing for HBO!Arguably the film with the highest profile and most distinguished pedigree of the three is ""You Don't Know Jack.""  Interestingly enough, it is also my least favorite.  There is certainly nothing wrong with ""Jack"" and I learned quite a bit about Kevorkian, who to my mind is darn near a saint.  From a surprisingly humble beginning, Kevorkian was a trailblazer and with single-minded purpose became a figurehead in groundbreaking legal debates about medical ethics.  It's a great and fascinating story, but Levinson gives it a surprisingly by-the-numbers presentation.  Anyone familiar with the routine cadence of a biopic will agree that this one ticks all the expected boxes.  Pacino is refreshingly restrained and, for the first time in years, brings an understated dignity to a role.  He does well capturing the unprepossessing doctor and he is ably assisted by John Goodman, Brenda Vaccaro, and Susan Sarandan.  ""You Don't Know Jack"" is a good film that's at its best when looking at the quietly intimate moments of Kevorkian's patients.""Temple Grandin,"" on the other hand, is the most unexpected of the three films.  I was fearful that ""Grandin"" might be a bit like medicine--good for me but not very fun.  But not so!  Both heartfelt and entertaining, this film pulses with life.  In an interesting visual style, it attempts to connect the viewer to how Grandin's mind visualizes things.  Unique in its presentation, it's also a dynamic narrative device!  Claire Danes does her best work in years--it's a showy role, but she doesn't showboat.  And like Pacino, Danes does a nice job of approximating the real life inspiration.  Grandin's story is terrific too.  She overcomes so much as a woman, as someone with autism, as someone who seems incapable of normalcy.  Through sheer perseverance and stubbornness, she made people listen and became an industry leader in the humane treatment of livestock.  Fascinating stuff, really--makes me wish I had a bit more gumption.And then we have the utterly charming ""The Special Relationship.""  Another film that is far more engaging than one might predict, ""Relationship"" plays almost like a sly comedy of manners.  A terrific Michael Sheen plays Tony Blair--and really who else could play Blair?  This is his third collaboration as Blair with screenwriter Peter Morgan.  A young Blair is infatuated with Bill Clinton (nicely done by Dennis Quaid) and adopts much of his style from his mentor.  The two form a friendship with Clinton in the driver's seat, but through the years as scandal strikes--there is a delicate shift in balance that makes for a role reversal.  Topical and true to the historical events, ""Relationship"" is also a smart and amusing riff on male bonding.  Morgan continues to be one of our strongest writers so it's no surprise that this is a literate and winning film.  Hope Davis also does a good Hillary.All in all, these are three worthwhile films.  Maybe it would make a fun biopic triple feature.  ""Jack"" ranks about 3 1/2 stars--nice but conventional.

Claire Danes did an amazing job portraying Temple Grandin. A must see for anyone who knows an autistic person. Not only will you gain knowledge and an understanding of the challenges of an autistic person and the key people in their life, but you'll be inspired as well.God is faithful in bringing good out of the trials and tribulations of our lives if we so chose to live life with open eyes and ears and a willing heart. And that's exactly what Temple Grandin did.TEMPLE GRANDIN will keep you on the edge of your seat, anxiously waiting to see what will happen next. You' be saddened by the hurtful words and actions of others as well as rejoicing in her spirit and determination.Temple was diagnosed at an early age with autism and recommended to be institutionalized but her mother Eustacia, played by Julia Ormond, wouldn't hear of it. Temple wasn't deterred for long by the negative words of others instead she grasped on to the positive ones from her mother, Aunt Ann, played by Catherine O'Hara, and one of her teachers, Dr. Carlock played by David Strathairn. Her life is a great example of how words can destroy or build up. Never underestimate the power of words.Temple went on to not only graduate from high school but from college as well, earning a doctorate and becoming a bestselling author, as well as a pioneer in the humane treatment of livestock.  I highly recommend this movie.

1332134,A2T049UQONS0OY,B0038M2AZA,Larry VanDeSande,"[5, 6]","Claire Danes is superb as Temple Grandin, the animal husbandrist born 1947 in Boston and designer of humane cattle processing plants. This film, released in 2010 by HBO Films, traces Grandin's life from her early years in Boston through 1981, when she spoke at a national conference on autism, the disability she carries in her life. It shows the beginning of her career as a scientist and advocate for autism and humane treatment of farm animals she discusses in her many books on the subjectAnimals Make Us Human: Creating the Best Life for Animals.The HBO made for broadcast film covers Grandin's youth, her years in boarding school and college, her pursuit of bachelor's and master's degrees at Arizona State University, and her early years in the cattle business where she strived to merge humane treatment for animals doomed to be food with solid science and business purposes. This is not a story about a bleeding heart animal lover; in contrast, it tells the story of a solid pragmatist, a scientist that works for better ways to manage animals raised for human food while paying the respect to the animals she believes they deserve. Grandin has gone on to revolutionize the way animals are treated in stockyards and in slaughterhouses, designing facilitiies that are more humane and at the same time more economically efficient.What is best in this film is the way it visualizes Grandin's brain at work. She sees the world in pictures, not in text or imagery. Even though I formerly worked for a state mental health agency that treated, among other things, autistic children, I was never sure exactly what the disability was. This film helped me understand its hold on people and how overstimulation in social situations is one of its more devastating consequences. You see this played out over and over again in the film, where Danes, as Grandin, is consistently at odds with a chaotic world in social situations but is completely in command of the world where she can visualize answers to significant intellectual questions.While I read her profile on Wikipedia, I don't know enough about Grandin to tell if the film is alwasy accurate in what it portrays. If it is, Grandin related more readily, in some respects, to other mammals than people. She learned early in life that the containment crate cattle go into (for branding or shots) calms them; she experimented with this on herself and found it had the same effect on her. This is only one of a couple dozen remarkable discoveries that await the viewer of this incredible film, which brought out my curiosity and interest more than any film I have seen in a very long while.With typically solid HBO production values and wonderful supporting performances from Julia Ormand (as Grandin's mother), David Strathairn (as her prep school science teacher that helped exploit her interest in science), and Catherine O'Hara as a loving relative, Temple Grandin is a knockout. To put it simply, this is one of the most enthralling, interesting, humane and entertaining movies I've seen in 2010 or any other year.HBO uses its resources well when it makes films and this time they have created a masterpiece, one surely deserving of the 7 Emmy award it won including best picture. I'm certain it will win at least half of those including Danes as best actress and whomever was in charge of wardrobe and makeup, as Danes looked remarkably like the real-life Temple Grandin throughout this movie.

Temple Grandin is my modern day heroine.The movie is brilliant, and the story is profound in its significance.I have some experience as a volunteer with autistic children. In the mid l970's, I worked at Napa StateHospital in California as a volunteer for a summer. The children were like Temple as a child.  The motherswere whispered about, as Temple's mother was scrutinized.What did we know?I did learn to lie on the floor with eyes closed ...and the children would come to me. It was haunting tosee Temple do that with the cattle!As an adult, I was diagnosed with ADD and have done many remedial treatments for it. Most successful breakthroughs were with cranial sacral therapy.My profession has been as a practicing clairvoyant.  When I close my eyes to do a reading (I enter thealpha state...or deeper)....and someone touches me, its as if they are ""running me through with a knife"".I suspect that autistic people cannot handle being touched for the same reasons..hypersensitivity. (Likeskinless wonders).With my eyes open, its not a problem...I can see it coming and I can handle it.The cranial sacral gave me a big breakthrough...its gentle touch to reverse affects from difficult childbirth(forceps/dry birth) and other childhood traumas, accidents, etc.I have recommended to Temple that she consider cranial sacral too.My theory is that there is a continuum of disorders....most extreme: autism, less extreme: aspergers,even less extreme: ADD, and more moderate still:  hypersensitivity/psychic awareness, then normal.If anyone would like to read my article about the ADD and my breakthroughs with cranial sacral,ask for ""Bridge Person Learns to Walk"".  Just email me at linda@lightworker22.com and I'll forward it to you.Back to this movie.It is inspiring, dramatic, and a huge testimony to a mother's love.

And, after watching the film, I must say that it certainly deserved every one of them.Claire Danes delivers an amazing performance as the real life autistic woman who has become one of the top scientists in the humane handling of livestock.  Julia Ormond is equally touching as her patient mother, as is Catherine O'Hara, cast as her loving aunt, and David Strathairn, as the high school science teacher who mentors the young woman, encouraging her to use her unique gifts to achieve her goals.TEMPLE GRANDIN is unlike other films that deal with mentally challenged individuals (e.g. RAIN MAN, FORREST GUMP) in that it does not make its central character a comic figure.  Ms. Danes and director Mick Jackson take us into the often-frightening world of the autistic, letting us see (as much as possible) the literal way that they think.Perhaps the most emotionally moving scene takes place at the end of this film when Temple and her mother attend a convention for parents of autistic children.  Observing another mother's frustration with her child's behavior, Temple stands up and explains to the woman and the crowd what it is like to be autistic.  If you haven't been using it already that is the moment where you will definitely need to have your box of Kleenex handy.A short ""Making of"" featurette on the DVD gives us the chance to meet the real Temple Grandin.From HBO Video.

Then for a while she seemed to fade into the woodwork.  ""Temple Grandin"" is a strong and welcome reaffirmation of Danes' abilities as an actress.As evidenced by the many reviews here, this is a disarming, straightforward little film about an individual's triumph over disability.  Of course, the message the movie carries is not so much about a misunderstood ""disability"" as it is about the simple condition of being ""different"".  Midway through the movie we see a large, prominent photograph of Albert Einstein in Temple Grandin's living quarters.  Point taken.  Einstein suffered from epilepsy; he was different.  If you can't appreciate difference, how can you recognize genius?Temple Grandin has autism, but she is gifted with the ability to instinctively think like an engineer.  She finds a solution to help quiet her problems of anxiety when she visits a cattle farm as a teenager.  Having empathy for the animals, but no understanding of human mannerisms, she elects to pursue a career in animal science.Much of the movie concerns her struggles to overcome the shortsighted, virulent chauvinism of western cattlemen that she seeks to work with in Arizona.  But, showing an incredible mix of resolve, pluck, and ingenuity, she manages to prevail.Claire Danes, playing Grandin, keeps a preternaturally alert expression on her face, betraying both fear and curiosity.  Danes also appears to have lost considerable weight to take on the role of a person who subsists on a diet of yogurt, pudding, and jello.  Julia Ormond is luminously beautiful as Grandin's loving and sympathetic mother;  David Strathairn is also effective as a teacher who spots Grandin's intellectual potential.This movie is a clear winner on all counts, with one minor detraction for me.  The musical score is a stale, numbing take on Philip Glass' minimalism.  Though it may have been intended to convey a sense of Grandin's inner struggles and determination, I found it instead to be merely irritating.

Claire Danes should really be up for an oscar for this role (even though I think all those awards shows are a bunch of malarky).The movie is based on two books, which I believe were both written by Temple herself.  I haven't read the books, nor did I know much about this story before I watched the movie.  So you don't have to be interested in autism to watch this movie!  It is that good!The movie follows Temple on her way to college, through college, and after her graduation with flashbacks on her past.  So while it doesn't give the whole story of her life, it gives you a good enough foundation so you have a feeling for what her life and struggles have been like.  She was, and is, and incredible role model for anyone who is faced with any type of challenge.A note, this movie does talk about and show, while not anything gory, the general process of cow slaughter, since that is what Temple became passionate about raising the standard for.  So if that goes against your beliefs, you may have issue watching this movie.My only complaint about this movie, was the flashbacks were a little distracting because I got lost on what time period I was watching.

Normally I defer to other reviewers for something like this, and just do a short review for the record to join the other 100+ DVDs for smart people that I recommend at Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog, but in this instance, I am not satisfied with the top-rated review; they do not do the combination of acting, story, and cinematographic representation justice.I watched this movie twice, the first time on background (a second screen), suffering through very low sound until I finally realized that it is imperative to use the DVD software controls to set it on stereo (at least for my configuration--if you get very low sound it is not a defective DVD, you just need to run through the audio settings); and then a second time.Here are some of the things I would itemize about what makes this one of the most extraordinary movies I have watched in my 59 years.+  The story takes second place to the human acting, the human portrayal by the actress playing Temple Grandin.  This is one of the most nuanced amazing performances I have ever seen, from body posture to eye control to voice to everything.  This is a phenomenal performance.+  The cinematographic depictions of how Temple Gradin ""sees"" are perfection in every possible sense.  The use of angles and measures and black and white rapid motion design sketches combined with very rapid run throughs of everything she remembers (e.g. all the shoes she has ever seen in a couple of seconds) are stunning in their effectiveness at teaching what the autistic person is seeing.+  The cinematographic depictions of how Temple Gradin ""hears"" and fears loud noises and how she relates one instance in front of her to hundreds of other instances in memory, many of them deeply frightening, it perfectly blended into the movie.+  The other actors, from those who understood and supporter to those who mocked her and blocked her, are all perfection in themselves.  This is practically a Norman Rockwell depiction--a panorama--of America.+  The specific scenes from stockyard to town to school are all enchanting--not the perfect word, but on second viewing, this is a movie where every single ""bit"" seems perfect to the moment.+  I am deeply engaged, often moved, and occasionally in tears as I see both the genius of autism, the genius of the actress, and the importance of the theme.  More than once I think to myself that this specific movie should be shown to every schoolchild and perhaps more than once.  If Stephen Hawkin in one stellar example of an almost completely disabled person who embodied genius, then Temple Gradin--and this movie's telling of the story--is a second.Over-all I would say this is a ""triple"" six-star movie: six plus for the actress, six-plus for the combined script-writer and the team that put this together, and six-plus for the utterly brilliant integration of every aspect of the cinematography.I've tried to think of other books and DVDs that I might fit into here to use the Amazon link feature that I like so much, but none comes to mind.

She learns rules to smooth social intercourse (you have to wear clean clothes, deodorant put on her desk ""use it""), no alcohol nicotine caffeine.Claire Danes viewed childhood videotapes of Temple repeatedly, listened to the changes in voice and observed altered posture which occured as Temple matured from 14 to 35years. Voice and movement coaches trained the actor to recreate aging bodily without cosmetics or prosthetics. Temple Grandin ""People who've heard me speak say that I speak better now that I'm in my 60s than when I was in my 50s."" Temple continues to improve as she chooses to accept the challenges of change: travel for public speaking, writing for publication. Normal brain cell development isn't complete (fully myelinated) until 30yo. Temple's new antidepressant generated brain cells (neurogenesis without neurotoxic alcohol nicotine caffeine) are now reaching full maturity and supporting continued learning in her mid60s.Temple's haptic experiences crawling through cattle pens, allowed her to translate cattle reactions to reflections off water, sun glinting off chains, shirts and changing colors to invent humane holding pens, stocks and dip tanks, publishing articles, books (her first book was Emergence) becoming a world recognized animal behaviorist.Temple Grandin's successes, hopes, dreams are realized by deciding to walk through challenging doors each day, every moment, suppressing sensory overload from noise, lights, internal visual images using coping skills she invented or was offered by those who care about her: it's just another door, if you choose to walk through it will open to whole new worlds.DVD describes true story of autism evolution through the intervention of animals, scientist mentor, abstract thinker aunt, and the faith of her pushy tiger mother. A memoir of resilience, perseverence, hope for those who think differently.Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined.

I based my decision on that and I'm glad I did. I was aware that it had to do with a woman born with autism, but nothing more. Viewing the film with lack of further knowledge about the plot helped draw me in and I suggest that the less you know going in, the more you will enjoy it. Yes, I said, ""enjoy"". The script and direction make for some funny - or at least ""smiling"" moments as we follow Grandin's life. Its not all in chronological order and that may throw you off a bit. But stick with it.Claire Danes is truly amazing in the title role. If you watched the Emmy Awards you saw what the real Temple Grandin looks like and Danes has her mannerisms down perfect. (If you didn't see the Emmys, you'll get to see - and hear - Grandin in the all-too-brief ""Making of"" featurette (just five minutes!) which is included as a bonus. Grandin appears on the full-length audio commentary along with the Director and Writer for the film.If this was a film made for theaters, I'm sure there would be Oscar noms, but it probably wouldn't have received the exposure it got on cable TV.

1332182,A303U1MOXG5R1F,B0038M2AZA,Sylviastel,"[1, 1]","I have to ask that question. Where did she get that name, Temple, in the first place? It's an odd name but just asking. Anyway Clare Danes is completely unrecognizable as the autistic genius Temple Grandin whose age ranges from 14 to 40 in this movie. This movie is truly an inspiration about Temple's amazing life. First, she's diagnosed with autism at 4 years old and suggested to be sent to a mental hospital. Her mother (played wonderfully by Julia Ormond) refuses to do so and works hard at reaching her. I don't know the exact moment when Temple started talking but she doesn't quit.As she gets older, Temple is sent to a boarding school where she gets to ride horses and bonds with science teacher, Professor/Doctor Carlock, (played beautifully by David Staitharn). He reaches out to her as a friend, teacher, and mentor as well.Temple spends a summer on her Aunt and Uncle's cattle ranch in Arizona. There she has an epiphany with the livestock. Her aunt is played by Catherine O'Hara. The film shows how Temple's mind thinks in visual pictures and how she relates to the world.She goes to Franklin Pierce College in New Hampshire where she must prove her machine helps her to calm down. She goes to graduate school for animal husbandry in Arizona where she encounters sexism, male chauvinism, and harsh treatment in a predominantly male-dominated field. Even though Temple dresses like a cowgirl almost all of the time and eats jello or yogurt, she doesn't fit with the guys nor does she try. She's much happier with the animals particularly the cattle that goes to slaughter. Temple's driven to improve the cattle's final days at the slaughterhouses.At the same time, Temple's demeanor is often strange because of her autism. She lives with it but it doesn't define her existence. That's the what the message is all about. This movie does prove how far Temple was determined to go.In the special features, I wished that they added more about Temple's life, a biography, or more to understand her. They offer a brief five minutes of the making of the film.Still, it's an extraordinary piece of film-making that would have easily won a Best Actress Academy Award for Clare Danes but she was already awarded an Emmy and Golden Globe Award for her performance in this role.

Through this movie I discovered I have Aspergers Syndrome.I spent years as a child at a horse stables, which I preferred over being with people. I'm very uncomfortable in social situations because I've never really understood people. I live alone by choice and never had children, preferring my cats to keep me company.

Having been diagnosed with autism in 1950 as a young child, Temple only began to speak (after lots of therapy) at the age of four. Temple was blessed with a supportive family and mentors in the form of teachers, therapists, etc. although she faced her share of prejudice and bullying, especially in middle and high school. Claire Danes portrays Temple with such insight and credibility that she is truly deserving of the Emmy award she won for this role.Temple Grandin's autism may have impaired her social skills somewhat, but what a brilliant mind! She invented the 'hug machine' for autistics who needed to be calmed when they were overstimulated, and she also developed ground-breaking methods for handling livestock, emphasizing humane handling. Today, Temple Grandin is a Professor at Colorado State University, and also a celebrated autism advocate.The movie, which is a semi-biographical account of Temple's early life and work in the field of livestock handling, manages to hit all the right notes. It is not sensational nor overly melodramatic and credibly portrays the struggles Temple faces on a daily basis as an autistic person. Things ordinary people take for granted, such as passing through an automatic sliding glass door, is portrayed as an almost insurmountable hurdle for Temple, who sees it as a guillotine! I loved the door metaphor which is used throughout the movie - each time Temple faces a challenge, she sees it as a door to be passed through to attain her objective! This is a must-see movie that will enable viewers to gain a deeper understanding of autism and its challenges.",5,Insightful movie about an amazing woman with autism,1291248000,"12 2, 2010",2010,1734,"['husband', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'were', 'very', 'impressed', 'inspired', 'Temple', 'Grandin', 'who', 'focus', 'film', 'Having', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'autism', '1950', 'young', 'child', 'Temple', 'only', 'began', 'speak', 'lots', 'therapy', 'age', 'four', 'Temple', 'was', 'blessed', 'supportive', 'family', 'mentors', 'form', 'teachers', 'therapists', 'etc', 'faced', 'share', 'prejudice', 'bullying', 'especially', 'middle', 'high', 'school', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Temple', 'such', 'insight', 'credibility', 'truly', 'deserving', 'Emmy', 'award', 'won', 'role.Temple', 'Grandin', 'autism', 'may', 'have', 'impaired', 'social', 'skills', 'somewhat', 'what', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'invented', ""'hug"", 'machine', 'autistics', 'who', 'needed', 'be', 'calmed', 'when', 'were', 'overstimulated', 'also', 'developed', 'ground-breaking', 'methods', 'handling', 'livestock', 'emphasizing', 'humane', 'handling', 'Today', 'Temple', 'Grandin', 'Professor', 'Colorado', 'State', 'University', 'also', 'celebrated', 'autism', 'advocate.The', 'movie', 'semi-biographical', 'account', 'Temple', 'early', 'life', 'work', 'field', 'livestock', 'handling', 'hit', 'right', 'notes', 'not', 'sensational', 'overly', 'melodramatic', 'credibly', 'struggles', 'Temple', 'daily', 'basis', 'autistic', 'person', 'Things', 'ordinary', 'people', 'take', 'granted', 'such', 'passing', 'automatic', 'sliding', 'glass', 'door', 'portrayed', 'almost', 'insurmountable', 'hurdle', 'Temple', 'who', 'guillotine', 'loved', 'door', 'metaphor', 'used', 'movie', 'time', 'Temple', 'challenge', 'door', 'be', 'passed', 'attain', 'objective', 'must-see', 'movie', 'will', 'enable', 'viewers', 'gain', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'autism', 'challenges']",N/A
