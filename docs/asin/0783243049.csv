71525,A2XZE1TB784HKX,0783243049,"alex fryling ""youngfry""","[0, 0]","Beyond The MatThis was another movie that just took me way too long to see. I have heard nothing but good reviews about this movie and now I can see why. One thing I will say is this most likely will never happen again for professional wrestling. At the time this movie was shot and released pro wrestling was at its peak. You had WWF going against WCW and those two shows combined at one point were drawing a higher rating then Monday Night Football. One thing that I really like about this movie was it gave people a look at what pro wrestling was really like. A lot of the time the media makes wrestling out worse than it is. Whether saying it's fake or too many people die in it this movie gives you a look into what the sport is really like. They had sit down interviews for this movie with different pro wrestlers. Some that took part in this movie where Jake the Snake Roberts, Mick Foley, Vince McMahon and others as well. It gave a look at guys coming into the business what they were going to have to deal with to make it big. As it showed in this movie it's not easy to make it to the big leagues and even when you make it there is no guarantee how long you will be there. One part that I really liked that they covered was they talked about the tole that it takes on your body. A lot of people believe just because wrestling is scripted it does not hurt which is completely wrong. The stuff that they showed the most of the hell in a cell match and the I Quit match with the Rock. I feel whenever someone who has not really watched wrestling sees Mick Foley and that Hell in a cell match it changes there perspective entirely. This was an awesome DVD and for any wrestling fan you have to own this in my opinion.

People from independent  wrestling organizations to Extreme Championship Wrestling to the greater  then all World Wrestling Federation (sorry Turner, no World Championship  Wrestling in this movie!). It was great because it was non-biased. It's  cool to see wrestlers at ease behind stage. Talking and hanging around with  one another knowing that they have to wrestle each other in a few minutes!  The movie has some footage of Vince McMahon, owner of the WWF. It proves  once and for all that he is &quot;THE MAN&quot;, and that he can make you  or break you in the industry. The movie focused on the lives of 3  wrestlers, Terry Funk (now 56, has retired and come back as much as Ozzy!),  the once famous Superstar Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts and Mick Foley  (aka Cactus Jack, Mankind, Dude Love). I don't want to spoil the movie by  going over their lives. I'll tell you one thing though, the shocker for me  was Jake the Snake!  Once the biggest star of the WWF, now turned into a  has-been crack addict. Wow, what a story!  That's just a part of his life,  you should see the rest of it, it's pretty sad!  The documentary also talks  about the struggles of trying to become a pro wrestler, pretty much getting  payed nothing. You have people that work as an airline mechanic, a  kindergarden teacher etc. It's a great movie, even if your not a fan of  professional wrestling.

Sometimes, behind all of the glamour and mayhem of professional wrestling, the audience forgets that these are real men with lives outside the ring. Beyond the Mat does a decent job of showing how wrestling effects the lives of these men, almost exclusively for the worse. The wrestlers often lose sight of just how harmful wrestling is for them. It takes a physical and emotional toll on them, sometimes leading to drug abuse, and it also seriously strains relationships, as seen in Jake 'The Snake' Roberts disturbing segment. Mick Foley, one of the most brutalized wrestlers in the history of the sport, is the subject of Beyond the Mat's most fascinating and successful segment. Foley and his sweet, gentle manner towards his loving family proves that there is a strong difference between the entertainer and the man behind the mask. And that's the message at the heart of the documentary: that wrestling is a show, not entirely staged or real. But the consequences of it on the real men are all too genuine. Beyond the Mat stumbles to find footing and ultimately seems like a biased love letter to the sport, but that is just part of its charm.",3,Is Wrestling Worth It?,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,1320,"['Mat', ""n't"", 'have', 'focus', 'depth', 'classic', 'documentary', 'up', 'slapdash', 'storytelling', 'relatability', 'characters', 'Sometimes', 'glamour', 'mayhem', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'audience', 'are', 'real', 'men', 'lives', 'ring', 'Mat', 'decent', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'wrestling', 'effects', 'lives', 'men', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'worse', 'wrestlers', 'often', 'lose', 'sight', 'just', 'how', 'harmful', 'wrestling', 'physical', 'emotional', 'toll', 'sometimes', 'leading', 'drug', 'abuse', 'also', 'seriously', 'relationships', 'seen', 'Jake', 'Snake', 'Roberts', 'disturbing', 'segment', 'Mick', 'Foley', 'one', 'most', 'brutalized', 'wrestlers', 'history', 'sport', 'subject', 'Beyond', 'Mat', 'most', 'fascinating', 'successful', 'segment', 'Foley', 'sweet', 'gentle', 'manner', 'loving', 'family', 'strong', 'difference', 'entertainer', 'man', 'mask', 'message', 'heart', 'documentary', 'wrestling', 'show', 'not', 'entirely', 'staged', 'real', 'consequences', 'real', 'men', 'are', 'too', 'genuine', 'Mat', 'stumbles', 'find', 'footing', 'ultimately', 'biased', 'love', 'letter', 'sport', 'just', 'part', 'charm']",N/A

To that I might state that only an old wrestler is sadder. After all, wrestling is not a true sport- it's a violent theatrical production, and there is not much at stake for the viewers. As for the wrestlers, themselves....that's where this documentary from 2000 comes in. Directed by first time auteur Barry Blaustein it chronicles the re-rise of pro wrestling to prominence in the late 1990s- the era that saw Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, and Cactus Jack become celebrities of a greater nature than any of their forebears, like Killer Kowalski, Dusty Rhodes, Bruno Sammartino, or Hulk Hogan.The film starts off as an exploration of the men behind the `names', yet it makes a mistake right off the bat, by billing itself as an expos&eacute; of the sport, a film that `Vince McMahon doesn't want you to see'. McMahon, to those in the know, is the owner of the largest wrestling league in the nation- the WWE, then the WWF, but there's little in the film to suggest that this is a tell-all. There are some wrestlers with gripes, and we see tales of failed lives, and failed wrestling circuits, like the ECW and WCW (long since bought out by the WWE), and McMahon's league certainly has a history of dealing in drugs (steroids, etc.- as the aforementioned Hogan testified against him in a highly publicized trial in the early 90s), as well as being shamefully anti-union, and not caring of its performers (not long after the film's release one of its wrestlers- Owen Hart, of a well-known wrestling clan- was killed in a spectacular fashion while performing, and the film acknowledges that one of its minor characters, Droz, was paralyzed not long after the film was completed), but all of this is public knowledge, and old news.What works, though is the portrait of the biz the film portrays, and the three main wrestlers whose lives it follows.... The film has its moments of poignancy and insight, but they are too few and far between. A more pristine and jaded eye would have been necessary, and a more ballsy approach to the subject matter, to gain a following outside the `choir' of pro wrestling. Still, since I go to those pews, every few years, I think it's a must see for any wrestling fan. The game has changed much during the decades, yet, in a sense, it hasn't changed at all.

Beyond The Mat has ensured that I will never forget that again.The premise of the Documentary is a simple one: Director Barry Blaustein would follow 3 Wrestlers, filming them both in & out of the ring. From this tried-&-true format comes an amazing glimpse into the inner workings of the Wrestling Biz.Blausteien follows Legendary Grappler Terry Funk, who is about to have his retirement match (He's since ""retired"" about 5 more times), Mick Foley, who at the time of filming was WWF Champion, and about to engage in one of the most sadistic matches in WWF History, his infamous ""I Quit"" match against The Rock at The Royal Rumble, and the troubled ""Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, whose toughest matches these days are his battles with drugs & his own demons.There are some truly unforgettable moments in this film for Wrestling fans. Who would have thought that Legendary Wildman Terry Funk was such a nice, soft-spoken family man? Who will ever forget Mick Foley's Wife and Children screaming in horror as he takes 11 brutal chairshots to his unprotected head fron The Rock? What long-time fan could not be horrified and saddened to see how far Jake Roberts has fallen...? There are also some great ""Time Machine"" moments, such as the brief glimpse of the pre-silicon Stephanie McMahon, and Stone Cold Steve Austin uttering waht may have been his first ""What?"". We also see the first WWF appearance of the unfortunate Droz, crippled in the ring shortly after the filming ended.The Director's Cut includes some new footage of Vince McMahon, surely one of the most loathsome ""Human Beings"", and I use that term loosely, on Earth. (I've never bought into the controversy about McMahon trying to keep Beyond The Mat from being released; as evidenced by Legendary Wrestler Bret ""Hitman"" Hart's struggles to liberate footage and stills of his WWF career from McMahon in recent years, McMahon rules WWF footage with an iron fist. Beyond The Mat uses extensive clips from the WWF archives, and McMahon would never have allowed that if he didn't approve of the film. There is also no mention whatsoever of WCW, The WWF's big rival at the time, another reason I believe that McMahon had more to do with the film than he wants you to believe.)The film is presented in full-frame, which drives me NUTS, but that's the only way it's available on DVD, so I guess it's better than nothing.

Amith (kndy),"[8, 8]","&quot;BEYOND THE MAT: UNRATED DIRECTOR'S EDITION&quot; DVD... what an awesome documentary!I was a big fan of wrestling many years ago and just  started watching again this year.  The game is more electrifying than ever  and things have changed since the 80's of WWF.  The focus on certain  wrestlers in this documentary was very fun and shocking to watch at the  same time.From Terry Funk getting the doctor's prognosis of his  battered body, Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts and the demons in his  life which was a shock to watch and most of all, the segment that really  hooked me in was Mick Foley's segment and how his family handled watching  him get beat during &quot;Royal Rumble&quot;.  Also, one of the reasons to  BUY this DVD is the comments Mick Foley had in the special features  commentary in which he comments about the Rock hitting him and boy, you can  tell Mick Foley was pissed at the Rock.  Also, you see a few features on a  few WWF and ECW stars in this documentary.Some people may want to call  this documentary perhaps &quot;The True Secrets behind wrestling&quot;.  I'm actually surprised to see the added footage of Vince McMahon...whoah!  A lot of things are in this video.  From people trying to get into the  business, the dangers of the business and the wrestler outside of the ring.As for the audio and video, the video has good colors, audio...I wasn't  expecting digital 5.1 to begin with.  As for the special features, it comes  with a trailer, production notes...not that much compared to other  movies/documentaries but if one thing truly shines in the special features  category, it's the commentaries on this DVD which are the big thing.  You  have to watch Mick Foley's commentary.  If anything, after I watched this  movie, you have more respect for Mick.  What a cool dude!So, wrestling  fans...this DVD is highly recommended.  VHS owners, you thought the movie  was good, buy the DVD to hear what Mick has to say in the director's  commentary...whoah!",5,BEYOND THE MAT DIRECTOR'S CUT DVD REVIEW: Shocking!,967852800,"09 2, 2000",2000,1995,"['quot', 'BEYOND', 'THE', 'MAT', 'UNRATED', 'DIRECTOR', 'EDITION', 'quot', 'DVD', 'what', 'awesome', 'documentary', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'wrestling', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'started', 'watching', 'again', 'year', 'game', 'more', 'electrifying', 'ever', 'things', 'have', 'changed', '80', 'WWF', 'focus', 'certain', 'wrestlers', 'documentary', 'was', 'very', 'fun', 'shocking', 'watch', 'same', 'time.From', 'Terry', 'Funk', 'getting', 'doctor', 'prognosis', 'battered', 'body', 'Jake', 'quot', 'Snake', 'quot', 'Roberts', 'demons', 'life', 'was', 'shock', 'watch', 'most', 'segment', 'really', 'hooked', 'was', 'Mick', 'Foley', 'segment', 'how', 'family', 'handled', 'watching', 'get', 'beat', 'quot', 'Royal', 'Rumble', 'quot', 'Also', 'one', 'reasons', 'BUY', 'DVD', 'comments', 'Mick', 'Foley', 'had', 'special', 'features', 'commentary', 'comments', 'Rock', 'hitting', 'boy', 'can', 'tell', 'Mick', 'Foley', 'was', 'pissed', 'Rock', 'Also', 'see', 'few', 'features', 'few', 'WWF', 'ECW', 'stars', 'documentary.Some', 'people', 'may', 'want', 'call', 'documentary', 'perhaps', 'quot', 'True', 'Secrets', 'wrestling', 'quot', ""'m"", 'actually', 'surprised', 'see', 'added', 'footage', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'whoah', 'lot', 'things', 'are', 'video', 'people', 'trying', 'get', 'business', 'dangers', 'business', 'wrestler', 'ring.As', 'audio', 'video', 'video', 'good', 'colors', 'audio', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'digital', '5.1', 'begin', 'special', 'features', 'trailer', 'production', 'notes', 'not', 'much', 'compared', 'other', 'movies/documentaries', 'one', 'thing', 'truly', 'shines', 'special', 'features', 'category', 'commentaries', 'DVD', 'are', 'big', 'thing', 'have', 'watch', 'Mick', 'Foley', 'commentary', 'anything', 'watched', 'movie', 'have', 'more', 'respect', 'Mick', 'What', 'cool', 'dude', 'So', 'wrestling', 'fans', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommended', 'VHS', 'owners', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'buy', 'DVD', 'hear', 'what', 'Mick', 'say', 'director', 'commentary', 'whoah']",N/A

It focuses mainly on Terry Funk, Mick Foley, and Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts.  It contains interviews with Vince McMahon who later tried to stop the film from being released (he is not portrayed as the nicest guy in the world).

It focuses on three Hall of Fame Wrestlers (in my book) Mick Foley, Terry Funk and Jake The Snake. It also shows scenes of up and coming wrestlers like the people's champ ""The Rock"".This movie is one of the best documentaries on wrestling next to""Brett Hart: Wrestling with Shadows"" and the biography on Owen Hart both available through A&E; home video.The movie shows what sacrifices and punishment these guys go through to put a show for us wrestling fans. We see Mick Foley get hit hard with a chair from the Rock when he was a bad guy while his kids and wife look on. His wife is in tears as she sees her husband take a beating.Anyone who says that wrestling is fake, should try out for the WWF and see how fake it really is. After only a couple of minutes getting backdropped, slammed and hit with a chair by these guys , I am sure you'll see it's not fake,as Hulk Hogan says ""its choreographed.""The biggest controversy of the movie is when Vince McMahon, corporate mogul and CEO of the WWF, decided to have this movie pulled off during commercials of the WWF and to ultimately turn his back on the whole project. Thereby making this film an Independent Film since it would no longer receive any help from the WWF.Nevertheless, Vince, makes several cameos in this movie, trying not to look like the greedy pig he really is.The timing of this movie is ironic, only a couple of months before this movie came out,Brett Hart would get screwed in his final match in Canada with Shawn Michaels, then in late May his brother Owen would die in a freak accident where he would fall to his death in front of a capacity crowd in a WWF pay per view event (that footage was edited out of the event).Recently (November 2000), the Hart family made a settlement with the WWF for a whopping $18 million dollars for the lawsuit the Hart's filed against the WWF. The Hart's say they will use some of the money for charity. I can just see the smile on Vince McMahon's face go down right now :-) . Now On to the review.The film is excellent and is a must see for all you WWF fans. It is already out on DVD with extra footage not seen in theaters. EBAY currently has several auctions for it starting at $10-20.A bargain for a really emotional,entertaining film.The Director, Barry Blaustein, who did some of the writing for the Nutty Professor, has shown here that he can do drama as well as comedy.If you're kid is foolish enough of thinking of getting into wrestling, you might want to show him this film, it will definitely change their mind.Which is the other theme of this movie, Wrestling is definitely something that is done by professionals.The ""extra footage"" while great is not necessarily importantas it contains inteviews with ""Chyna"" and ""Tommy Dreamer""back when Dreamer was in ECW and ""Chyna"" was just about tohave boob implants and jaw surgery to make her ruggedimage more sexy.Pay attention also to the former employees illegaly fired Vincesuch as Koko B.

It wails on the then WWF but at the same time tells the process of going to a training camp, working out, finding a trainer, going to Vince and letting him check you out, and then finally getting a match. Then it tells the back stories and life stories of some of the greatest wrestlers ever, Jake the Snake, Terry Funk, Mick Foley, and the Rock. It also shows a look at a day in the life of a wrestler. It also shows what happened before and after The I Quit Match at the Royal Rumble 1999. It also shows the match from Mick's family's point of view. The movie itself is unrated and is an hour and 48 minutes. The commentary and visual commentary is amazing because they tell secrets about the movie like Vince is never that kind to new blood. You learn things that you would have never expected like everything is coreographed before the match and they are told what to say.

He takes his crew into the backstage areas that few fans ever get to see.  The stories are primarily positive. We get to see Mick Foley/Cactus Jack/Mankind as a real life dad.  Out of the wrestling superstars, Foley probably comes across as the most &quot;normal&quot;.  Terry Funk has long been known as &quot;wrestling's original madman&quot; and we get to see the effects that a so-called phony sport has taken on his body.  Something drives him to keep doing it, even though he's allegedly retired many times. The feature of Jake The Snake Roberts is the darkest. Here is a man haunted by a past that he can't seem to escape.  The contrasts in Jake's early appearances and what he's become due to drugs and alcohol are astonishing.

I watch  all three major federations on a regular basis and I can honestly say, who  still cares about Terry Funk?  Don't get me wrong, the guy is a hardcore  legend but why devote a whole movie to him when there are so many other  more interesting wrestlers.  Don't be fooled by the cover either, The Rock  is only in BTM for a total of five minutes and Steve Austin is barely shown  in passing.  The Mick Foley segments are OK and everyone who follows  wrestling on a regular basis already knows that Foley has taken some  serious bumps and is starting to pay the consequences.  BTM is more for  people who are casual fans, people who didn't know that Foley got thrown  off the top of the Hell in a Cell by the Undertaker or got his ear ripped  off doing a hangman stunt.  By far the most interesting of the interview  segments deal with Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts who since vanishing  from the wrestling scene has delved deep into the dark underworld of drug  abuse.  These scenes are shocking and saddening, as when Jake states that  the only way he will wrestle for an unspecified independent promoter is if  they supply him with crack cocaine.  BTM is a good attempt at capturing the  lives of pro wrestlers outside of the ring, but it is way too cynical for  my tastes.  Blaustein should have balanced the film more by the showing the  enormous success and luxury that some wrestlers can attain, guys like Chris  Jericho, Steve Austin, Triple H, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Bill Goldberg.

The producer/director, Barry Blaustein, spent  two years traveling around the country and making this film.  The president  of the World Wrestling Federation, Vince McMahon is in it, but has refused  to advertise it on TV and has tried to suppress it.  This has only added to  the interest I had in the film.The audience is told from the beginning  that this is not a sport, but a spectacle, with choreographed excitement  and no doubt of the outcome of each match.  And perhaps that is why there  are no regulations to protect the wrestlers.  They wrestle 25-27 days per  month, are constantly traveling, and are usually in pain.  Because even  though it is a staged performance, the blows are often real;  these men are  just willing to absorb it.We see the wannabe's learning to wrestle in a  gym;  we see the staging of the big shows; we see the sumptuous office of  WWF and a young wrestler discussing his promotion with McMahon.  And then  we also see the very real people behind the hype as Blaustein does in-depth  interviews and spends time with three very different wrestlers.We see  the blood, the injuries, the very real pain.  We see the hype, the  spectacle  and the joy of making big bucks.  We get an inside view of an  industry that has captured the imagination of the public.

This dvd also includes the theatrical trailer, which I think is a pretty good trailer. It also has a conversation dinner with Mick Foely, Jesse the Boddy Venura, and Director Barry Blaustein. They discuss what made Mick and Jesse want to become wrestlers., which the conversation is also very funny, as which before I saw it I know it was gonna be funny. They also discuss of how do you deal with not being there for your kids, and what makes you want to stay as a wrestler. They also talk about legendary wrestlers, legendry matches and how the wrestling buissness has changed, and other stuff about the wrestling buisness. The other thing about this dvd that it shows new scenes. Interviews from then, and interviews updated. Meaning new interviewsThis dvd is a pretty cool dvd. For some reason I expected more, but what could there be its documantary, they couldn't have any deleted scenes, or behind the scenes. What I thought they should have had though was legendary matches. Thats basically what I think this dvd needs.

We find out how stars are made and created by the WWF and other smaller promotions. This documentary was very reavealing. Blaustein was able to succeed with this documentary on the fact that he was able to gain the wrestler's trust. Many of facts startled me as well like how Chyna was a U.N. Scholar. The most revealing part of the film though was with Jake The Snake Roberts. When I first viewed it, I was shocked to see how low he had gone (I knew already about his bouts with alcoholism and drug abuse). Even going as far as alienating his daughter was shocking. A couple of weeks ago, Jake was on a wrestling program called Chairshots. He sounded horse, but still ready to argue the facts of the film. He claimed Mick Foley and Terry Funk were the only one that were paid for doing the film (which strikes me as odd since Vince McMahon didn't even get a cut of the profits). He also said that he was lied to about the film, as Blaustein told him that it was going to be a TV special on the dangers of wrestling (which I dont believe). Jake also said that he is on good terms with his daughter from the film (which I extremely find hard to believe). Just about everything Jake said in the interview was disputable. I have both versions of this film but I bought the rated version the other day for the fact it had bonus footage. It was nice to see Chris Adams in the bonus footage because his appearances on TV are now rare. The bonus footage gives more understanding to stuff that was in the film. This is one documentary every wrestling fan would watch.

71560,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,0783243049,R.A. McKenzie,"[3, 3]","REVISION NOTESI originally typed this review in August of 2005.  Since then, I have researched this movie and its subjects.  Most of the persons' interviews and opinions believe this documentary is biased and extremely one-sided.  After learning that, I am sickened that ""Beyond The Mat"", which was one of my favorite films for a long time, isn't as substantial as I once believed it to be.  Before reading my original review, please note that ""Beyond The Mat"" still provides a powerful emotional experience.  It's manipulative and somewhat non-factual, but aren't all films merely an interpretation anyway?  Well, enough lecturing...here's my original review:ORIGINAL REVIEW""I've been a fan of televised wrestling for 19 years, and going strong.  This documentary looked like it would be all praise and glorification, but instead turned out ot be one shocking portrait of the human condition.Fanboy Barry Blaustein (who used to be an Saturday Night Live writer) poses a question, ""Who are these guys?""  That is a dreamy question that turns into a dark journey of despair and sadness.  Blaustein mainly focuses on three of the business' top performers.Mick Foley is one of the most gentle human beings in the world, who is also gifted with an uncanny ability to take ridiculous amounts of violence and brutality.  His story basically contrasts his kindness with his in-ring persona, plus with some relationship footage with his wife and kids.Terry Funk has been around for over 30 years, and is still doing some insanely violent matches to his 58-year-old body.  He contemplates retirement (for the ""X""th time), and may just do it this time.Jake Roberts wasn't a great athlete, but he knew how to play to the crowd and keep them attentive.  Sadly, he's become a drug-abusing has-been, who has a tragic past and equally sad relationship with his daughter.Now this all sounds as if this is going to be on depressing moment after another.  To be honest, most of this movie is cuthroat analysis of the politics and struggles of the wrestlers and the industry's key players.But there are sheds of light in this dark, depressing tunnel.  We see a former English school-teacher with blood across his head smiling and sharing his joy of wrestling.  A gangster-ish performer with a criminal background is given a chance to audition for movies, and seems to have a future if he chooses to pursue.  It's little touches like that enhance Blaustein's experience.The small towns of the Midwest contrasted with the WWF's state-of-the-art spectacle is truly riveting.  Seeing a couple of independent boys make it to the WWF tryouts is one of the movie's best scenes.There are a couple of non-cohesive edits and clips that don't seem to fit.  For example, the opening title sequence shows a bunch of clips from WWF and ECW television, but don't really explain what they are.  Only the most hardcore fan out there will make any sense of these clips.  Blaustein talks to us sometimes as if we know who he's talking about, but doesn't go all the way for a couple of people to really get to know them.  It's almost a teaser for the TV programs.But Blaustein managed to tap into the harsh realities of entertainment in general.  There are the Terry Funk's who don't know when to quit, even if it destroys their careers and bodies.  There are the Jake Roberts's who have fallen so far from grace, that the public will always endear them while condeming.  We'll always have the Vince McMahon's tyrannically controlling entertainment with sly sadism...all for our viewing pleasure.This movie is a masterpiece!""",5,Every Wrestling Fan Should See This,1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,3585,"['REVISION', 'NOTESI', 'originally', 'typed', 'review', 'August', '2005', 'then', 'have', 'researched', 'movie', 'subjects', 'Most', 'persons', 'interviews', 'opinions', 'believe', 'documentary', 'biased', 'extremely', 'one-sided', 'learning', 'am', 'sickened', 'Mat', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'long', 'time', ""n't"", 'as', 'substantial', 'once', 'believed', 'be', 'reading', 'original', 'review', 'please', 'note', 'Mat', 'still', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'experience', 'manipulative', 'somewhat', 'non-factual', 'are', ""n't"", 'films', 'merely', 'interpretation', 'anyway', 'Well', 'enough', 'lecturing', 'here', 'original', 'review', 'ORIGINAL', 'REVIEW', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'televised', 'wrestling', '19', 'years', 'going', 'strong', 'documentary', 'looked', 'would', 'be', 'praise', 'glorification', 'instead', 'turned', 'out', 'ot', 'be', 'one', 'shocking', 'portrait', 'human', 'condition.Fanboy', 'Barry', 'Blaustein', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'writer', 'question', 'Who', 'are', 'guys', 'dreamy', 'question', 'dark', 'journey', 'despair', 'sadness', 'Blaustein', 'mainly', 'three', 'business', 'top', 'performers.Mick', 'Foley', 'one', 'most', 'gentle', 'human', 'beings', 'world', 'who', 'also', 'gifted', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'take', 'ridiculous', 'amounts', 'violence', 'brutality', 'story', 'basically', 'kindness', 'in-ring', 'persona', 'relationship', 'footage', 'wife', 'kids.Terry', 'Funk', 'been', '30', 'years', 'still', 'doing', 'insanely', 'violent', 'matches', '58-year-old', 'body', 'retirement', 'X', 'th', 'time', 'may', 'just', 'do', 'time.Jake', 'Roberts', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'athlete', 'knew', 'how', 'play', 'crowd', 'keep', 'attentive', 'Sadly', 'become', 'drug-abusing', 'has-been', 'who', 'tragic', 'past', 'equally', 'sad', 'relationship', 'daughter.Now', 'going', 'be', 'depressing', 'moment', 'be', 'honest', 'most', 'movie', 'cuthroat', 'analysis', 'politics', 'struggles', 'wrestlers', 'industry', 'key', 'players.But', 'are', 'sheds', 'light', 'dark', 'depressing', 'tunnel', 'see', 'former', 'English', 'school-teacher', 'blood', 'head', 'smiling', 'sharing', 'joy', 'wrestling', 'gangster-ish', 'performer', 'criminal', 'background', 'given', 'chance', 'audition', 'movies', 'have', 'future', 'pursue', 'little', 'touches', 'enhance', 'Blaustein', 'experience.The', 'small', 'towns', 'Midwest', 'contrasted', 'WWF', 'state-of-the-art', 'spectacle', 'truly', 'riveting', 'Seeing', 'couple', 'independent', 'boys', 'make', 'WWF', 'tryouts', 'one', 'movie', 'best', 'scenes.There', 'are', 'couple', 'non-cohesive', 'edits', 'clips', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'example', 'opening', 'title', 'sequence', 'bunch', 'clips', 'WWF', 'ECW', 'television', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'what', 'are', 'Only', 'most', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'there', 'will', 'make', 'sense', 'clips', 'Blaustein', 'talks', 'sometimes', 'know', 'who', 'talking', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', 'couple', 'people', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'almost', 'teaser', 'TV', 'programs.But', 'Blaustein', 'managed', 'tap', 'harsh', 'realities', 'entertainment', 'general', 'are', 'Terry', 'Funk', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'quit', 'even', 'careers', 'bodies', 'are', 'Jake', 'Roberts', 'who', 'have', 'fallen', 'so', 'far', 'grace', 'public', 'will', 'always', 'endear', 'condeming', ""'ll"", 'always', 'have', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'tyrannically', 'controlling', 'entertainment', 'sly', 'sadism', 'viewing', 'pleasure.This', 'movie', 'masterpiece']",N/A

It tells the story of several wrestlers all at different stages and places in their careers.Jake 'the Snake' Roberts' is the typical story of a down and out former star that's hit rock bottom.  His story is like a VH1 Behind the Music minus the great comeback.Terry Funk's the fading star that just can't quite give up the life he's always know.Mike Modest and Tony Jones are the young hopefuls looking for their shot in the big dance.Mick Foley's story is the most interesting of all, showing the life of a family man and one of the most extreme wrestlers in the game.  His match with the Rock in the Royal Rumble was difficult to watch, particulary alongside the shots of his young children crying at the sight of their father's pain.All in all, a great film...this wasn't hard hitting journalism talking about all the problems with McMahon or the rampant steriod problem in professional wrestling.  Some of the darker issues were covered in the Jake the Snake segment, but when compared to the life of Foley, Jake's problems can be easily attributed to personal choices.If you want good behind the scenes coverage of late 90s pro-wrestling, this is the film to see.",5,Best Rasslin' Documentary I've seen,1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,1264,"['Mat', 'not', 'only', 'insightful', 'wrestling', 'documentary', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'film', 'story', 'several', 'wrestlers', 'different', 'stages', 'places', 'careers.Jake', 'Snake', 'Roberts', 'typical', 'story', 'down', 'former', 'star', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'story', 'VH1', 'Music', 'great', 'comeback.Terry', 'Funk', 'fading', 'star', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'give', 'up', 'life', 'always', 'know.Mike', 'Modest', 'Tony', 'Jones', 'are', 'young', 'hopefuls', 'looking', 'shot', 'big', 'dance.Mick', 'Foley', 'story', 'most', 'interesting', 'showing', 'life', 'family', 'man', 'one', 'most', 'extreme', 'wrestlers', 'game', 'match', 'Rock', 'Royal', 'Rumble', 'was', 'difficult', 'watch', 'particulary', 'shots', 'young', 'children', 'crying', 'sight', 'father', 'pain.All', 'great', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'hard', 'hitting', 'journalism', 'talking', 'problems', 'McMahon', 'rampant', 'steriod', 'problem', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'darker', 'issues', 'were', 'covered', 'Jake', 'Snake', 'segment', 'when', 'compared', 'life', 'Foley', 'Jake', 'problems', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'attributed', 'personal', 'choices.If', 'want', 'good', 'scenes', 'coverage', 'late', '90s', 'pro-wrestling', 'film', 'see']",N/A

In Beyond the Mat, he explains why he loves wrestling's contrived dramas. Whether viewers agree or not, they won't see wrestling the same way after watching this film.The best thing about the film is its people. Beyond the Mat covers stars (Mick Foley), ""has-beens"" (Terry Funk and Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts), and those who never made it. By the end, viewers have gotten to know and care about these men.The most-memorable segments focus on Jake Roberts. By the late-1990s, Roberts was wrestling in tiny arenas in out-of-the-way towns. He was homeless, drug addicted, and estranged from his family. Robert isn't always easy to like, but the viewer cheers for him anyway. (It is obvious that the movie ""The Wrestler"" with Mickey Rourke drew much from Roberts' story).Mick Foley makes a much better impression. He comes across as a ""regular guy"" who hit in big. Foley is tender with his wife and kids. But it is interesting to note that - in spite of his family's pleas - Foley has never entirely given up wrestling.Some of the peripheral people in the film don't contribute much. Vince McMahon comes across as a sleazy egotist. Jesse Ventura - the Governor of Minnesota at the time of the film - appears but has little to say.Even though I'm not a wrestling fan, I thoroughly enjoyed Beyond the Mat.

71569,ABLBRUT8DALNN,0783243049,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","Adult professional wrestling fans aren't stupid, we know wrestling is fake and the outcomes are pre-determined. What none fans don't realize is why we like it. It's the drama, the pageantry, the cheesy stories, the costumes, and most of all the action. Yes, it's pre-determined and choreographed, but you still need to be charismatic and athletic, and night after night these guys put their bodies on the line just for our entertainment. People have been killed and paralyzed doing this, so to anyone who says it's not real and takes no skill, I point to this documentary. Beyond The Mat looks into the lives of these guys outside the ring and show the ancient Terry Funk, whose body has been ravaged from years in the ring. He can barely walk anymore, but still has to get in there and has to do this because it's all he knows and what he loves. Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts is also featured and he talks about how eight years on the road with WWE made him a neglectful father, a bad husband, and a drug addict. Roberts says between the pain and the constant moving around he could never have done it without drugs! Finally, they look at Mick Foley AKA Mankind, Dude Love, Cactus Jack and show how he's this normal family man and while his family knows it's for show, how much they worry. In the last 30 years, hundreds of pro-wrestlers have died under the age of 45, most of them due to the physical trauma they've put their bodies through or the dependence on drugs that has resulted from it. If those were NFL or MLB stars instead, there would be massive reform and congressional intervention, but the truth is no one cares about these guys, except of course their families, friends, and fans. Beyond The Mat is important because it shows just what these guys put on the line and just how little the people at the top care.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,1823,"['Adult', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'fans', 'are', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'know', 'wrestling', 'fake', 'outcomes', 'are', 'pre-determined', 'What', 'none', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'why', 'drama', 'pageantry', 'cheesy', 'stories', 'costumes', 'most', 'action', 'Yes', 'pre-determined', 'choreographed', 'still', 'need', 'be', 'charismatic', 'athletic', 'night', 'night', 'guys', 'put', 'bodies', 'line', 'just', 'entertainment', 'People', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'paralyzed', 'doing', 'so', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'real', 'skill', 'point', 'documentary', 'Mat', 'lives', 'guys', 'ring', 'show', 'ancient', 'Terry', 'Funk', 'body', 'been', 'ravaged', 'years', 'ring', 'can', 'barely', 'walk', 'anymore', 'still', 'get', 'there', 'do', 'what', 'Jake', 'Snake', 'Roberts', 'also', 'featured', 'how', 'eight', 'years', 'road', 'WWE', 'made', 'neglectful', 'father', 'bad', 'husband', 'drug', 'addict', 'Roberts', 'pain', 'constant', 'moving', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'done', 'drugs', 'Finally', 'look', 'Mick', 'Foley', 'AKA', 'Mankind', 'Dude', 'Love', 'Cactus', 'Jack', 'show', 'how', 'normal', 'family', 'man', 'family', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'worry', 'last', '30', 'years', 'hundreds', 'pro-wrestlers', 'have', 'died', 'age', '45', 'most', 'due', 'physical', 'trauma', ""'ve"", 'put', 'bodies', 'dependence', 'drugs', 'resulted', 'were', 'NFL', 'MLB', 'stars', 'instead', 'would', 'be', 'massive', 'reform', 'congressional', 'intervention', 'truth', 'one', 'guys', 'course', 'families', 'friends', 'fans', 'Mat', 'important', 'just', 'what', 'guys', 'put', 'line', 'just', 'how', 'little', 'people', 'top', 'care']",N/A
71570,AP3B615GM191G,0783243049,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 2]","A few years ago, I was very excited to watch Mickey Rourke's film ""The Wrestler"".  However, upon viewing the film, I was left feeling disappointed with the project but couldn't quite put my finger on why.  After watching ""Beyond The Mat"", I now fully realize what that feature film was missing: it the case of professional wrestling, the truth is undoubtedly stranger (and more compelling) than fiction.For a basic summary of this documentary, it focuses on four primary areas:1. The ""independent"" or ""minor league"" pro wrestling circuit conducted in gyms and town VFW's across the nation.2. Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, former WWE superstar, who now battles fierce demons (smoking, the bottle, crack, family troubles) just to stay alive.3. Mick ""Mankind"" Foley, a man with an unnerving pain threshold that, while making it big, worries about the effects his punishment may have on his children.4. Terry Funk, a wrestling lifer who reflects upon his career in an insane business...the ECW.As a fan of professional wrestling (WWE in particular), this documentary really pulled at the heartstrings.  Whereas the glitz, glamour, and pageantry all look great on screen, the horrors and tribulations that often result from such antics gives one serious pause.  Each one of those four stories showcases a different type of battle that professional wrestlers face, and they are all very interesting.The Jake Roberts story is especially intriguing, as it portrays a man so deeply conflicted about his past, present, and future, that one wonders how a person could get so screwed up.Overall, this is an incredible documentary that is well worth a watch if you have an interest in professional wrestling whatsoever.  If you watched Rourke's ""The Wrestler"" and came away wanting something more, this little film will likely satisfy you.",5,"Skip Rourke's Wrestler, Watch This Instead",1305504000,"05 16, 2011",2011,1822,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'watch', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'film', 'Wrestler', 'However', 'viewing', 'film', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'disappointed', 'project', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'why', 'watching', 'Mat', 'now', 'fully', 'realize', 'what', 'feature', 'film', 'was', 'missing', 'case', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'truth', 'undoubtedly', 'stranger', 'more', 'compelling', 'fiction.For', 'basic', 'summary', 'documentary', 'four', 'primary', 'areas:1', 'independent', 'minor', 'league', 'pro', 'wrestling', 'circuit', 'conducted', 'gyms', 'town', 'VFW', 'nation.2', 'Jake', 'Snake', 'Roberts', 'former', 'WWE', 'superstar', 'who', 'now', 'fierce', 'demons', 'smoking', 'bottle', 'crack', 'family', 'troubles', 'just', 'stay', 'alive.3', 'Mick', 'Mankind', 'Foley', 'man', 'unnerving', 'pain', 'threshold', 'making', 'big', 'worries', 'effects', 'punishment', 'may', 'have', 'children.4', 'Terry', 'Funk', 'wrestling', 'lifer', 'who', 'career', 'insane', 'business', 'ECW.As', 'fan', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'WWE', 'particular', 'documentary', 'really', 'pulled', 'heartstrings', 'glitz', 'glamour', 'pageantry', 'look', 'great', 'screen', 'horrors', 'tribulations', 'often', 'result', 'such', 'antics', 'one', 'serious', 'pause', 'one', 'four', 'stories', 'different', 'type', 'battle', 'professional', 'wrestlers', 'face', 'are', 'very', 'interesting.The', 'Jake', 'Roberts', 'story', 'especially', 'intriguing', 'man', 'so', 'deeply', 'conflicted', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'one', 'how', 'person', 'could', 'get', 'so', 'screwed', 'up.Overall', 'incredible', 'documentary', 'well', 'worth', 'watch', 'have', 'interest', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'whatsoever', 'watched', 'Rourke', 'Wrestler', 'came', 'away', 'wanting', 'something', 'more', 'little', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'satisfy']",N/A
