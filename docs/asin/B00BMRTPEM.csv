1635713,A3SZXYX9YEDGT6,B00BMRTPEM,"Addison Dewitt ""I'm nobody's fool.""","[1, 1]","Having not seen the series on Starz, I was interested in this DVD of the first season (and only season) to watch on nights nothing else was entertaining. The series highlights the ""War of the Roses"" period of Edward IV's reign, but concentrates more on the events from Queen Elizabeth Woodville's point of view. This is what I would categorize as an semi-historical, overly-romanticized version with good acting, a huge budget for costumes and filming but not so much left for extras.WHAT I LIKED:The acting is fairly good, what I'd expect for TV. Some scenes felt a little off, as if they used the first one or two takes and just moved on. Some felt better as if they were really worked on and rehearsed well and you ""felt"" what was coming across. A fave character was Cecily Neville, Edward's mother who injects a bit of comedic evil into the series, with her over-the-top hat and hair and evil, squinting grimace and sharp tongue.The costumes were excellent in manufacture and style - albeit fewer than what was probably needed.The filming / editing was very good, lots of nice foggy, sunbeam effects and subtle moods. Rich, saturated colors, very royal looking throughout. Color palettes were cheery and bright in scenes with the queen's family, dark and sinister during scenes of Warwick and his brood.WHAT I DID NOT LIKE:Considering this is the king and queen who, according to history books, spent lavish amounts on clothes, jewelry and furnishings, I cannot but think they would have had a few more outfits than what were shown. Edward is seen in the same doublet in many, many scenes and if you look closely it's getting a bit frayed. This did not ring true for a king who was totally into fashion.A few houses in the background shots were not of the period and were plainly architecture from centuries later. This was the era of daub and wattle with thatched roofs, almost none of this was seen anywhere, even the most flimsy of facades could have been erected.  I was keen on finding other ""tells"" (like plumbing or conduit) but never saw such, thankfully, though they were talked about online from other sources.Some acting was oddly not in character. As well, the gratuitous sex scenes, (oddly thrown in for seemingly no reason in places) while tastefully shot and choreographed, were not very realistic. Men coupled with women and finished within seconds. I've seen local birds mate slower.There never seemed to be enough extras to actually depict a crowd or army where necessary. I suspect this was a budgetary move, costuming an entire crowd or army would not only take a lot of time, but the costs would skyrocket if accuracy were to be followed.The mixing in of witchcraft into the story is wholly false as there is zero mention of such things in any historical reference I can find. It seems this was added by the novelist to add a bit of intrigue and spice to what could have been a boring existence.SUMMATION:All in all, it's an entertaining series and does reveal another side of history, if not somewhat overly-romanticized.  I wanted to like this series more, but it just felt like something was a bit ""off"" throughout and I started losing interest toward the end of the series. It can entertain and fill an evening of otherwise bad television, however.

I can't say I enjoyed this as much as The Tudors or The Borgias and other docu-drama series, but as a mini-series this was entertaining for what it was. I'm not sure why this is being sold as &#34;The White Queen: Season 1&#34; when the packaging states it was a mini-series and I can't imagine what they'd do for a second season, but just know if you HAVEN'T watched this - The White Queen is not getting a second season. It was designed as a ten episode mini-series for the Starz network and that's exactly what you are getting here.The first three episodes were pretty good and we watched them in a row. The pacing was fast and the storytelling was tight but as the series went on, things really began to drag. it was as if the scriptwriters realized they were going way to fast through &#34;The Cousin's War&#34; novels and had to slow things down and drag things out to meet the ten episode commitment. As such, the pacing dramatically changed and we started to get bored with the series towards the end.

1635718,A3T0A0NM8636JW,B00BMRTPEM,"Amazon Customer ""Book lover and illustrator""","[0, 1]","I've enjoyed this show's first episodes, but as it nears the finale, to what should have been a climax of hate, ambition and vengeance,  it just lost steam and became very vanilla and not convincing.Let's agree to put aside every thing we know about the real history and forget Shakespeare's ""Richard the 3rd"" and just go along with the narrative the show provides us, it  still  comes up very short in providing a convincing motives for the main characters to do what they do. Here Richard, Earl of Gloucester, the future king Richard the 3rd, is depicted as an honorable man, a loyal brother and a decent chap generally, so - whatever makes him do all the horrible things he does? Why should he go against his own beloved brother dying wish to secure the throne for his son? Shakespeare gave us a motive - ambition, and created a character who is definitely the inspiration to Kevin spacey's character in ""House of card"" - a cold blooded villain who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. But this is not the case here, so Richard's action are puzzling and his character just totally flips from righteous to evil out of no where. People whom you saw generally getting along suddenly are at each other's throats without anything major happening.The focus of the show was to highlight the influence of the WOMEN and how they shaped  the history, but I have to say they failed there as well, as they did not create a single memorable character that can actually make you believe she can influence anyone. The titular character, the white queen, Queen Elizabeth, is indeed very beautiful and sweet so you can buy how her husband  fell for her and married her  despite of his family's objection, but her sweet nature stand in bitter contrast to what you'd expect from a figure in the middle of such a power struggle. She seems to be  a person who'll have a hard time not tipping a sloppy waiter in a restaurant, let alone scheme and plot and advice her husband in real life and death situation. As for her woman adversaries, they are not so well constructed as characters and again it's hard to say what are their reasons for hating her so much. The only one whose motives are well explained is Lady Margaret, and that is because she is simply raving mad, and super annoying.It was a disappointment, because it could have been so much more. It's like a poor man's ""game of thrones"", which is a darn shame, considering GRR Martin whole inspiration for his story of came from this  cruel and bloody piece of history. I enjoyed the beautiful costumes, there were a few attractive actors and the love story between the King and queen is touching, but as a drama it just did not work.",3,Not that engaging,1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,2680,"[""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'show', 'first', 'episodes', 'finale', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'climax', 'hate', 'ambition', 'vengeance', 'just', 'lost', 'steam', 'became', 'very', 'vanilla', 'not', 'convincing.Let', 'agree', 'put', 'aside', 'thing', 'know', 'real', 'history', 'forget', 'Shakespeare', 'Richard', '3rd', 'just', 'go', 'along', 'narrative', 'show', 'still', 'up', 'very', 'short', 'providing', 'convincing', 'motives', 'main', 'characters', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'Here', 'Richard', 'Earl', 'Gloucester', 'future', 'king', 'Richard', '3rd', 'depicted', 'honorable', 'man', 'loyal', 'brother', 'decent', 'chap', 'generally', 'do', 'horrible', 'things', 'Why', 'should', 'go', 'own', 'beloved', 'brother', 'dying', 'wish', 'secure', 'throne', 'son', 'Shakespeare', 'gave', 'motive', 'ambition', 'created', 'character', 'who', 'definitely', 'inspiration', 'Kevin', 'spacey', 'character', 'House', 'card', 'cold', 'blooded', 'villain', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'what', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'so', 'Richard', 'action', 'are', 'puzzling', 'character', 'just', 'totally', 'flips', 'righteous', 'evil', 'where', 'People', 'whom', 'saw', 'generally', 'getting', 'suddenly', 'are', 'other', 'throats', 'anything', 'major', 'happening.The', 'focus', 'show', 'was', 'highlight', 'influence', 'WOMEN', 'how', 'shaped', 'history', 'have', 'say', 'failed', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'not', 'create', 'single', 'memorable', 'character', 'can', 'actually', 'make', 'believe', 'can', 'influence', 'anyone', 'titular', 'character', 'white', 'queen', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'indeed', 'very', 'beautiful', 'sweet', 'so', 'can', 'buy', 'how', 'husband', 'fell', 'married', 'family', 'objection', 'sweet', 'nature', 'stand', 'bitter', 'contrast', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'figure', 'middle', 'power', 'struggle', 'be', 'person', 'who', ""'ll"", 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'not', 'tipping', 'sloppy', 'waiter', 'restaurant', 'let', 'alone', 'scheme', 'plot', 'advice', 'husband', 'real', 'life', 'death', 'situation', 'woman', 'adversaries', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'well', 'constructed', 'characters', 'again', 'hard', 'say', 'what', 'are', 'reasons', 'hating', 'so', 'much', 'only', 'one', 'motives', 'are', 'well', 'explained', 'Lady', 'Margaret', 'simply', 'raving', 'mad', 'super', 'annoying.It', 'was', 'disappointment', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'poor', 'man', 'game', 'thrones', 'darn', 'shame', 'considering', 'GRR', 'Martin', 'whole', 'inspiration', 'story', 'came', 'cruel', 'bloody', 'piece', 'history', 'enjoyed', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'were', 'few', 'attractive', 'actors', 'love', 'story', 'King', 'queen', 'touching', 'drama', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'work']","The White Queen - Complete Series The White Queen: Series 1  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"

1635722,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B00BMRTPEM,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[36, 50]","The White Queen is a ten-part mini-series based on three novels from Philippa Gregory's Cousins' War series: The White Queen, The Red Queen and The Kingmaker's Daughter. Unusually for this sort of series, the focus is less on the men and battles and more on the viewpoints and experiences of three women who played important roles in the period. These are Elizabeth Woodville, the minor noble who becomes Queen Consort (unusual in a time when the king usually marries European royalty or nobility); the pious Margaret Beaufort, the mother of Henry Tudor (the future Henry VII); and Anne Neville, the younger daughter of Richard Neville and the future wife of the notorious Richard III. Other women also play important secondary roles, such as Margaret of York (Henry VII's bride-to-be), Isabel Neville (Anne's older sister) and Jacquetta, Lady Rivers (Elizabeth Woodville's mother). This presents an interesting female perspective on a period of history traditionally dominated by accounts of battles and manly men strapping on armour.Or rather, it would if the series worked. The White Queen may be the very definition of 'inconsistent'. The series lurches from mediocrity to being outright terrible to having a couple of pretty decent episodes and then back again. It's certainly no Game of Thrones (the huge success of which is almost certainly responsible for this series being made; the Wars of the Roses were a major influence on George R.R. Martin's books) but it often struggles to even be The Tudors.On the plus side, the casting for the most part is good. The actresses playing the central three roles are all pretty good, though Amanda Hale's Margaret Beaufort has to cope with some pretty awful writing at times (her reaction to any crisis being to proclaim, ""This is God's will!""), with Faye Marsay (Anne Neville) being one of the few actors to convincingly age in her performance as well as appearance over the course of the series. James Frain's scheming Earl of Warwick is excellent, with his political machinations occasionally being interrupted by Gordon Ramsay-style explosive losses of temper at his allies' incompetence or bad judgement. Rupert Graves schemes admirably as William, Lord Stanley in the latter half of the series (and should be signed up for Game of Thrones as soon as an appropriate role becomes available). Aneurin Barnard makes for a convincing Richard III, who is here played as a more tragic figure doomed by circumstance rather than a cartoon villain (despite developing a passing resemblance to Edward Scissorhands by the series finale). David Oakes (George, Duke of Clarence) may be getting typecast as 'gittish medieval noble bloke', having played this role before on Pillars of the Earth and The Borgias, but he plays it very well. The weakest link here is Max Irons, whose oafish and dull Edward IV is lacking the charisma of the real historical figure.The series is at its best when centred on a short time-period. The sixth through eighth episodes (covering the relatively peaceful period between the Battle of Tewkesbury and Edward IV's death) are the strongest, as they focus on political machinations, family relationships and the characters themselves. The ninth episode, which jumps forward to the rise of Richard III and the situation with the Princes in the Tower, is also decent. However, the first half of the series is deeply flawed. Dialogue is almost exclusively based on exposition, with people reeling off information as if from a Wikipedia entry in a vain effort to keep the viewer up to speed on what the heck is going on. Weeks and sometimes months pass between scenes with absolutely no indication of the passage of time and the compression of seven years of fairly intricate history into just five episodes (the remaining five cover fourteen years) turns out to be a really bad idea. People swap sides, often for no apparent reason, and there is a lack of depth to events. It feels like the drama bits of a good docu-drama, only without the context for what is happening (a familiarity with the Wars of the Roses - or just keeping the Wikipedia page open as you watch - is useful). These early episodes are kept alive only by the heroic efforts of James Frain and, to a lesser extent, our three leads.That said, the series finale is pretty diabolical. The lead-up to the Battle of Bosworth and the battle itself are compressed into one hour, leaving no time for the aftermath, some of which is deliciously ironic (particularly the taught relationships between Margaret Beaufort, Elizabeth Woodville and Maragret of York). The series has no real ending, just fading out after the battle without much reflection on what's happened. This feels anti-climactic and fails to put the series in its proper historical context for those who are not already knowledgeable about the time period. My co-watchers had no idea that Elizabeth Woodville and Margaret Beaufort were the grandmothers of Henry VIII, for example, and not ending with an epilogue where Margaret sees her grandson being crowned (she died only after Henry VIII came to power) seems like a missed opportunity.In terms of historical accuracy, the series is surprisingly good in its first few episodes. It doesn't dial back the complexity of affairs too much, although a few minor characters like the Earl of Warwick's brother, are missing. As the series goes on, however, it deviates more and more from actual history. A few times it shows some good judgement - such as managing to maintain the ambiguity of the fate of the Princes in the Tower without sacrificing the drama - but more often than not it makes baffling choices. The showdown between Elizabeth Woodville's brother Antony, guarding her son and heir Edward V, and the soon-to-be Richard III is ripe stuff for television drama but the TV show simply removes it.However, the series ultimately has two major problems which moves it from 'watchable tosh' to 'barely watchable hokum' category. The first is that Jacquetta and her daughter Elizabeth are witches. I don't meant they are accused of being witches (as both were in real life), but they actually are witches. They use magic on multiple occasions to summon storms to smash enemy fleets or delay them from sailing and put curses on people that ultimately kill them or leave their children dead. For a series based on real historical events, this injection of pure fantasy is jaw-droppingly stupid. They don't even sell it particularly well, with the participants discussing their magic-using ways in letters and everyone around them being relaxed about it.Secondly, the show looks cheap. It may have been made for $25 million (that's about $39 million, or a bit more than half the budget of a season of Game of Thrones), but that's simply far too little to tell a story of this magnitude. The costumes are good (blatantly visible zips aside) but the bulk of the action takes place on a relatively small number of sets or on locations re-used a few too many times for supposedly different locations. The budget problem is most notable when it comes to the battles. The Wars of the Roses turned on a series of major battles at Towton, Barnet, Tewkesbury and Bosworth Field. Towton predates the start of the series, but the other three battles are fought during it and all of them are fake, unconvincing and so poorly-staged they might as well have not bothered. In particular, the decision to film both the Battle of Barnet and the Battle of Bosworth Field (and that's 'Field', remember) in the same forest (!) is truly moronic. Armies are shown marching in single file and then rushing towards one another with zero semblance of formation, tactics or strategy. The production team only seem to have about 15 extras available and no CGI budget (a couple of shots of ships aside, there doesn't seem to be any CGI at all in the series, which is baffling as it means they can't stage any big events convincingly), so the battles then unfold in extreme close-up with no continuity from shot to shot, making it almost impossible to follow what's going on. So as to avoid showing the fact they have no extras, the director also sticks the camera on the ground aiming up at people, which gets distracting quite quickly.Ultimately, you cannot tell the story of 20 years of the Wars of the Roses (and not even the full conflict) in just ten episodes. The pacing is shot to hell in the first half of the series, meaning most people won't stick around for the decent-ish episodes in the latter half. The budget is woefully inadequate for the scale and scope of the series, and the attempt to stretch it to cover everything leaves it looking cheap. The writing is often excruciating (though this also improves in the latter half). All of this undermines the work of some pretty good actors heroically tackling the iffy material.The White Queen (**) has moments when it almost works, but these moments can't quite make up for the crushing mediocrity and outright incompetence of the rest of the series.",2,Awful pacing and dialogue overwhelm some good performances,1376870400,"08 19, 2013",2013,9028,"['White', 'Queen',

I haven't watched the other medieval-themed cable series, but I imagine this one has more in common with &#34;The Tudors&#34; than &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;.  This historical drama dramatizes the War of the Roses, when two houses of the same family, the House of York (the &#34;White Rose&#34;) and the House of Lancaster (the &#34;Red Rose&#34;) battled for the English throne in the 15th Century. The story is based on a novel series by Philippa Gregory, and it focuses effectively on the women's role in all the intrigue, power (or lack thereof) and betrayal of the time.  The acting is uniformly excellent, though as an American viewer, I recognized few of the cast, except the wonderful Janet McTeer as Lady Rivers (Elizabeth's mother) . Amanda Hale is beautiful and captivating as Elizabeth Woodville, a &#34;common country girl&#34; (of a landed gentry family) who is wooed by and marries King Edward IV. She reminds me of a young Gwyneth Paltrow.  James Frain is intense and smoldering as the ruthless &#34;Kingmaker&#34;, the Earl of Warwick.  The sets and costumes are impressive and realistic.  Though at times it's hard to figure out who's related to whom and how, and the scheming gets rather elaborate, Though based on historical facts, I'm sure much of it is romanticized - for instance, it's nice to think that Elizabeth and Edward had such a loving marriage, but the truth may be a bit less ideal.

Elizabeth Woodville is beautiful, King Edward IV is tall, Richard III is short with dark hair, the Duke of Clarence is good looking and greedy, etc., and David Oakes does a fantastic job playing the latter character.

According to history, Jaqcuetta Woodville was accused of witchcraft twice, and had to defend herself against the accusations. She must have done so ably, as she was never convicted and died of an unspecified disease when she was in her late 50's.I wished there had been more outdoor shots, as in The Tudors, which had beautiful outdoor scenery and lighting.

Even fans of the Shakespeare 'histories' understand that there is little true historical accuracy beyond the broad description of events.  And I am a fan of Shakespeare's histories!So dropping the accuracy guideline, this is an outstanding series, though something keeps it from being quite five stars.  The acting is overall very good, but the actual story chugs at times.

It takes the perspective of three women, Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beaufort and Anne Neville and their quest for power.  The English throne is disputed between two families, the house of York and the house of Lancaster.  The series starts with the house of York's Edward IV being crowned King with the help of a master manipulator and his good friend Lord Warwick, but then the newly crowned King of England falls in love with and marries a beautiful Lancastrian commoner, Elizabeth Woodville, which Lord Warwick opposes.  From there the series is about the power struggles, vengeful retribution and what these three main women will do to gain the crown of England.The White Queen is a Starz production and as you would expect contains it's fair share of nudity, although the graphic violence is surprisingly kept to a minimum.For me the series started slowly, introducing you to the characters, background and plots of each of the main characters.  A little too slowly for my liking as it took a couple of episodes and I was almost at the point of stopping watching it, but then it got better and drew you in to the engaging plotline but ultimately tailed off again towards the end of the first series.Production value seems fairly cheap but most of the acting is quite good but nowhere near the levels of Game of Thrones, which is so much better on every level.

1635741,ALRA7DEY3FFTI,B00BMRTPEM,Deborah,"[1, 1]","I am not a fan of Philippa Gregory; however, I've long been interested in the Wars of the Roses and Richard III.  For example, I've read Paul Murray Kendall's and David Baldwin's biographies of Richard and Amy License's biography of his queen, Anne Neville, and I followed with great curiosity the discovery and verification of Richard's remains under a parking lot in Leicester.  Before purchasing the DVDs, I'd read a lot of negative comments about The White Queen miniseries but I'd also read positive comments about some of the performances.  I was particularly interested in Aneurin Barnard's performance as Richard, Duke of Gloucester, later Richard III.  The miniseries had already started filming when Richard's skeleton was discovered showing that he'd had scoliosis, which would have made one shoulder higher than the other as contemporary accounts described Richard.  The skeleton also showed that Richard was not as deformed as Shakespeare described so even though Barnard plays him without any deformity, his performance still seems closer to the historical Richard than Shakespeare's psychopathic crippled hunchback with a withered arm.Other reviewers have discussed the historical errors so I won't go over them again except to say I found them very annoying and they did interfere with my enjoyment of the miniseries and are the reason I rated it three stars.  I was disappointed by the Special Features since many of them seemed to be rehashes of the same interviews.  However, since I primarily bought the miniseries for the performances, I'm satisfied.  In addition to Aneurin Barnard, I must especially mention how much I enjoyed Rupert Graves as the slimy, self-serving Lord Stanley and Amanda Hale as Lady Margaret Beaufort.",3,Flawed but still enjoyable drama about the Wars of the Roses,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,1746,"['am', 'not', 'fan', 'Philippa', 'Gregory', 'however', ""'ve"", 'long', 'been', 'interested', 'Wars', 'Roses', 'Richard', 'III', 'example', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Paul', 'Murray', 'Kendall', 'David', 'Baldwin', 'biographies', 'Richard', 'Amy', 'License', 'biography', 'queen', 'Anne', 'Neville', 'followed', 'great', 'curiosity', 'discovery', 'verification', 'Richard', 'remains', 'parking', 'lot', 'Leicester', 'purchasing', 'DVDs', ""'d"", 'read', 'lot', 'negative', 'comments', 'White', 'Queen', 'miniseries', ""'d"", 'also', 'read', 'positive', 'comments', 'performances', 'was', 'particularly', 'interested', 'Aneurin', 'Barnard', 'performance', 'Richard', 'Duke', 'Gloucester', 'later', 'Richard', 'III', 'miniseries', 'had', 'already', 'started', 'filming', 'when', 'Richard', 'skeleton', 'was', 'discovered', 'showing', ""'d"", 'had', 'scoliosis', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'one', 'shoulder', 'higher', 'other', 'contemporary', 'accounts', 'described', 'Richard', 'skeleton', 'also', 'showed', 'Richard', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'deformed', 'Shakespeare', 'described', 'so', 'even', 'Barnard', 'deformity', 'performance', 'still', 'closer', 'historical', 'Richard', 'Shakespeare', 'psychopathic', 'crippled', 'hunchback', 'withered', 'arm.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'discussed', 'historical', 'errors', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'over', 'again', 'say', 'found', 'very', 'annoying', 'did', 'interfere', 'enjoyment', 'miniseries', 'are', 'reason', 'rated', 'three', 'stars', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Special', 'Features', 'many', 'seemed', 'be', 'rehashes', 'same', 'interviews', 'However', 'primarily', 'bought', 'miniseries', 'performances', ""'m"", 'satisfied', 'addition', 'Aneurin', 'Barnard', 'must', 'especially', 'mention', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'slimy', 'self-serving', 'Lord', 'Stanley', 'Amanda', 'Hale', 'Lady', 'Margaret', 'Beaufort']","The White Queen - Complete Series The White Queen: Series 1  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"
1635742,A1EYGKF8TR69KB,B00BMRTPEM,debra,"[53, 69]","Before I saw this series, I did not know what The White Queen was about. I saw a trailer for it on TV and found that it was to be a TV series based on Philippa Gregory's novel of the same name. I knew of her work from the movie version of her novel The Other Boleyn Girl (a very inaccurate take on Tudor history), but have not as of yet read any of her novels based roughly upon between 15-1600's on the Tudor's and so fourth. I love Tudor history and more than that I love anything on the British Monarchy. I know a lot on Henry VIII and his wives as well as Queen Elizabeth I, but I did not have any knowledge onto the Plantagenet's or anything about the War of the Roses. So I jumped on this series and immediately began to watch it hoping it to be better than the Showtime series The Tudors.I have to say at first I wasn't sure I thought though while the story seemed to be intriguing, I wasn't falling for the main characters like King Edward and his wife Elizabeth in the first episode, but by the second and third episode of the series I was completely hooked. I know there are a lot of reviews from critics saying the series didn't hold up to the standards they expected, but I think a lot of that was based on the first episode alone in the series and not the story all together as a whole.I never realized how fascinating the War of the Roses was or what it was about. I think what makes this story so much more compelling to me versus other shows around the time period like The Tudors, is that it is told in the view of the woman who stood behind the throne and who shaped England's history dramatically without the world even realizing their importance to what was happening on the throne and how they could influence it. Unlike in The Tudors where it was more of a mans view on the world. Their are three main woman who shape the story over the period of ten episodes. You have the White Queen Elizabeth who was King Edwards wife, then you have Queen Anne who was Queen to King Richard III and you have Margaret who becomes the King's mother to Henry VII.These woman are each inspiring in their own ways. Elizabeth Woodhouse is a very strong character in the story. She's not afraid to voice her opinion and stand for what she says. She was also one of the first monarch's to have her children stay with her while they were growing up, where in all other noble families you would send them away for months or years at a time to be tutored and not brought back to live with their families till after their education was completed on how they were to behave as a future king or queen. While Anne in the beginning is very passive wanting to please her family and sister, she is caught in the middle as her father tries to get her older sister married to one of the brother's of Kind Edward and keeps being tossed aside till her father needs her in one of his schemes to take the throne. Through all of this she finds her strength and takes charge of her own destiny. While Margaret is devote to god and seeing her son put on the throne at such huge odds that when you think of it, it's amazing she achieved so much with so much in front of her, when the cards seemed stacked against her.What makes this series work so well are the different view points that are captured through the eyes of these woman. You can't help but feel for each one of them as they are pushed from one place to another, but each time this happens they rise again. What Philippa Gregory has done so well is she has shown 3 different view points of the same conflict and has shown us as the viewers different perspectives to the story line based on view you are looking at.This series is a fast pace series as far as time lapses go. Episode 1 starts off with the meeting and marrying of King Edward to Elizabeth Woodhouse. By episode two they are married and have children and by the end you are at the beginning of the Tudor era. Even though there are gaps by years in the show it flows so well together and the drama keeps you glued to the screen. You can't help but feel for these ladies in the show.As far as how accurate this series it to her books I don't know, how accurate it is to history I do not know either. What makes a great historical drama period piece is when a author knows how to weave the fiction on around the historical events that truly took place. I feel that as far as I can see Gregory has done just that, but just don't quote me completely on it!

1635743,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00BMRTPEM,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[0, 0]","""The White Queen - Season One"". . . .Just looking at the cover art, I didn't have high hopes for this series: it obviously seemed like a ""Game Of Thrones"" wannabee or a trashy historical bodice-ripper like ""The Tudors"" turned out to be.  But, oh, what a pleasant surprise ""The White Queen"" proved to be. This series expertly presents the insanely complex political machinations of the War Of The Roses, as seen through the template of the marriage of Edward IV and his queen, Elizabeth Woodville. Edward's relatively long reign set the stage for the infamous drama of Richard The Third, Edward's brother who basically stole the throne after his death, and whose defeat at the Battle Of Bosworth marked a decisive end to the war for the crown.The characters in this series are vivid and compelling, the scripts are intelligent and suspenseful, and the acting is generally superlative. The largely sympathetic portrayal of Richard is a welcome change of pace from Shakespeare's well-known villainous caricature and other characters similarly emerge as flawed yet fascinating figures, and all of them believable and multi-faceted. The series is remarkably good on the history -- accurate (though opinionated) up through the drama of ""the Princes in the Tower,"" where there is no solid historical record to draw on... This is an excellent entry to the genre of historical fiction about the English monarchy, and is very rewarding both as fact and as fiction.Sitting down to binge-watch this series with a good rack of mutton, an open cask of wine and Wikipedia's English history articles available when you need them is an experience not to be missed!

1635752,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00BMRTPEM,Grady Harp,"[37, 50]","One night early there was a preview showing of this new series from the Brits. It looks promising if a bit unorthodox in its approach to history and slips in the settings and costumes. The series is based on Philippa Gregory's novel, `The Cousins' War' and roughly the story line promises to follow these lines:  Set against the backdrop of the Wars of the Roses, the series is the story of the women caught up in the long-drawn-out conflict for the throne of England. It starts in 1464--the nation has been at war for nine years fighting over who is the rightful King of England, as two sides of the same family, the House of York and the House of Lancaster, are in violent conflict over the throne. The story focuses on three women in their quest for power, as they manipulate behind the scenes of history--Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beaufort and Anne Neville.In the first episode we don't see much more than King Edward's bedding and wedding of Elizabeth, a lot of bickering, some fighting, and some castle intrigue. Rebecca Ferguson plays Queen Elizabeth, Amanda Hale plays Lady Margaret Beaufort, Faye Marsay is Anne Neville, and the remarkable actors are Janet McTeer as Jacquetta Woodville (Elizabeth's magical mum) and Max Irons (handsome son of Jeremy Irons) as King Edward. James Frain is an unusually grumpy and sour Lord Warwick and Caroline Goodall is splendid as the evil Duchess Cicely. It is difficult to tell from an isolated episode, but the series has enough interest in the poorly understood realm of the War of the Roses for American audience that it will probably have staying power.

What I got was a smart, well-written, and intricate series that is more like a great book that you just can't put down.  The story is a contested England during the War of the Roses.  The main concern here, however, is the intrigue behind the young king's surprise wedding to a commoner while under the pressures of protecting his crown.  Where this really shines is in both the writing and acting.  In the first episode, there is a scene where the new queen's mother absolutely eviscerates the king's mother with her tongue.  It is a debate more like a chess match, but with all the venom required to create a life-long enemy.  If you aren't hooked by that point, well, maybe you should go seek some reality TV to pass the time.The directing and scenery are both outstanding.  In fact, my only regret is that I have this on DVD rather than Blu-Ray.  If you like complex dramas that are tightly written and well acted, you should buy this immediately!

The Tudors (which perhaps should have simply been named Henry VIII), Sherlock, Downton Abbey, The Borgias (well, OK that was a US production), Inspector Moore, and others.  I had high hopes for the White Queen, which is based on a trilogy of novels written by Phillipa Gregory and centered on 3 prominent female figures in the famous &#34;War of the Roses&#34;.History buffs (I can't say I'm a scholar of English history) have nitpicked about how complex issues are condensed into simple choices; characters seem either good or evil and not well-rounded, and of course how many years of history are condensed into what seems a shorter period of time (as was The Tudors, to a high degree).  Or that occasionally you can glimpse something modern in the background.  Those things do not bother me.  The story I think gives a reasonably accurate depiction of events that went on during this time span.  What turned me off was that I started not liking ANY of the characters.  Unlike having a problem with them depicted &#34;good&#34; or &#34;bad&#34;, I felt they're all grasping for power in their own way, but none of them seemed any better than the others.  If you don't feel an emotional connection with at least one character, it's hard to like a production.  That's why I left off partway through this one-season series.  If you want to grasp some of the War of the Roses and don't mind that nobody seems very noble in character, then you may enjoy this series.The US version is prominently flagged by Starz, though it was a joint BBC/Staz production.

1635775,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BMRTPEM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","When ""The White Queen"" was announced as a Starz series, I was pretty excited by the concept.  I have a weakness for these historical epics (The Tudors and The Borgias, for example) and feel that premium cable is the perfect place to showcase refreshingly adult tales that demonstrate another side of history.  And while I don't require explicit historical accuracy (I don't mind dramatic liberties), I do like for the shows to have a certain realnness in feel and in consequence.  What I didn't realize, initially, was that ""The White Queen"" was based off a couple of wildly popular Philippa Gregory novels.  Gregory has been prolific and successful in the genre hybrid that is historical romance, taking true life stories and turning them into bodice ripping page turners.  That's not a knock on Gregory or her readers, but the stories tend to skew toward a certain demographic.  And truthfully, I don't fall into that readership.  On watching the opening episode of ""The White Queen"" adaptation, it was clear from the onset that this was going to be done with a heavy dose of romantic intrigue and soap opera plotting as opposed to playing for historical credibility.  I don't think that's a bad choice, it was just different from what I expected.As ""The White Queen"" opens, a headstrong widow in 15th century England decides she must confront the new King about the birthright that has been taken away from her sons.  Elizabeth Woodville (the, perhaps, too plucky Rebecca Ferguson) is that young woman, and her determination places her on a crash course with destiny.  Despite her family's open opposition to the new regime in days past, the King (Max Irons as Edward IV) is instantly smitten with the beguiling creature.  Nothing develops in a particularly organic way, the two simply fall in love with little provided in the screenplay to make this a credible relationship.  For the sake of expediency, the show just pushes them together so that the plot may advance.  When Irons decides that he wants Ferguson as his Queen, this put the entire political empire in jeopardy.  Among the emerging power players, Irons' friend and advisor Lord Warwick (James Frain) is most put off by this development.  He hoped to install a puppet king and rule in his stead.  Keeping young Ferguson in check is her wily mother (the ever dependable Janet McTeer), a wise and no-nonsense woman with ties to the mystical.""The White Queen"" is an opulent period recreation.  The staging and costumes are appropriately impressive and, overall, I liked the series a bit more as it progressed.  There is plenty of intrigue, back-stabbing, political machinations, and court scandal to keep even the most jaded viewer involved.  It rushes headlong through history and covers several generations worth of characters.  For my taste, Ferguson starts out a little too modern for my liking (for example, as she sasses Irons' mother on their first meeting) but it's not a deal breaker and as her character ages, I settled in as well.  Both she and McTeer were nominated for Golden Globe Awards for their performances (and McTeer is great), but I also enjoyed Irons (son of Jeremy Irons and Sin&eacute;ad Cusack) as well as an immense international cast filled with many familiar faces.At about 3 1/2 stars, I will round up ""The White Queen"" because it does tell an inherently interesting tale and I genuinely liked (if not loved) it.  The story, at times, does feel a bit too rushed.  Fitting two books and several decades into the miniseries, it does occasionally jump time periods too easily.  ""The White Queen"" may not be for every taste, but it's an effective adult soap opera dressed up in period garb.

Once I finished watching Season 1, I couldn't stop thinking about the history of The War of The Roses.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that Philippa Gregory has written an entire series: The Cousins' War.The White Queenis the first book in the series.  I hope the book is as good (if not better) than the series, as I'm hoping to have a good series to read for a bit!Anyway... back to the Starz series.  While it was highly entertaining (my husband & I didn't want to stop watching it) it was also depressing.  Seasoned with an incredible amount of scheming, plotting, & revenge with betrayal as the main dish.  The innocent & guilty are all fair game to loosing their hearts, heads or both!  The acting is excellent.  The props, costumes & hairstyles, the scenery, battle gear & castles are a stunning compliment to the time period being portrayed.A main character(s) has been left out of the credits... breasts. It would have been a 5 star show if it wasn't cheapened by a plentiful amount of totally unnecessary breast shots.  Seriously, a scene would be of one naked breast.  The focus of the camera wasn't on the characters faces, just the breast.  I actually burst out laughing.  It was so ridiculous.  I'm not a prude by any means & do not have any issues with nudity.  Unfortunately the way it is presented in The White Queen it is completely unnecessary & I feel it cheapened the series. Yes, they are very lovely natural breasts, but is the show about breasts or the crown?Aside from all the lovely breasts, this is a great show & I highly recommend it especially if you are a fan of historical fiction.",4,Much Better Than I Expected,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,1724,"['love', 'historical', 'fiction', 'filled', 'romance', 'murder', 'mystery', 'are', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'White', 'Queen', 'Once', 'finished', 'watching', 'Season', '1', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'history', 'War', 'Roses', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'Philippa', 'Gregory', 'written', 'entire', 'series', 'Cousins', 'War.The', 'White', 'Queenis', 'first', 'book', 'series', 'hope', 'book', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'series', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'have', 'good', 'series', 'read', 'bit', 'Anyway', 'back', 'Starz', 'series', 'was', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'husband', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'stop', 'watching', 'was', 'also', 'depressing', 'Seasoned', 'incredible', 'amount', 'scheming', 'plotting', 'revenge', 'betrayal', 'main', 'dish', 'innocent', 'guilty', 'are', 'fair', 'game', 'loosing', 'hearts', 'heads', 'acting', 'excellent', 'props', 'costumes', 'hairstyles', 'scenery', 'battle', 'gear', 'castles', 'are', 'stunning', 'compliment', 'time', 'period', 'being', 'portrayed.A', 'main', 'character', 's', 'been', 'left', 'credits', 'would', 'have', 'been', '5', 'star', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'cheapened', 'plentiful', 'amount', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'breast', 'shots', 'Seriously', 'scene', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'naked', 'breast', 'focus', 'camera', 'was', ""n't"", 'characters', 'just', 'breast', 'actually', 'burst', 'out', 'laughing', 'was', 'so', 'ridiculous', ""'m"", 'not', 'prude', 'means', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'issues', 'nudity', 'Unfortunately', 'way', 'presented', 'White', 'Queen', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'feel', 'cheapened', 'series', 'Yes', 'are', 'very', 'lovely', 'natural', 'breasts', 'show', 'breasts', 'crown', 'Aside', 'lovely', 'breasts', 'great', 'show', 'highly', 'recommend', 'especially', 'are', 'fan', 'historical', 'fiction']","The White Queen - Complete Series The White Queen: Series 1  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"

This refers to Anne Neville, Richard III&#34;s queen.The casting of Anne is this series is horrendous. They turn her into an ugly, dowdly frump, wearing the same ugly dress scene after scene. Beauteous. Get it? The author wanted to make Richard a hero, so they uglied up the character of Anne, so he would seem soooo romatic for marrying her. Not buying it. That Richard may have been enamoured with this beautiful girl I can accept. That she was enamoured with him, I cannot. He was a very plain man, and very physically handicapped.The stupid sex and nudity is just a distraction. They look like they're jumping each other like dogs. The casting of the other characters was fine. And I found Margaret Beaufort's role riveting. It seems everybody is getting raped in this film. We don't need to see that.The story is complex and I have read the history on this extensively.  They make several errors.1. According to an account Anne, runs away from her evil brother in law and winds up in a bake shop in London, after which she gets a message to her cousin Richard who fetches her and takes to a convent (He left her there for three months to make sure she was not pregnant). This is deleted. Also, the series states that Richard got Anne's money. No, Clarence got all of it. Richard fought hard for her fortune but essentially married her, as they say, in her shift.2. The series shows Richard showing up at court. shortly before  Edward, his brother, dies. NO. Richard stopped the young Prince of Wales on his journey to London and took custody of him. I don't think Richard even got to the funeral in time.3. The producer evidently did not like the coifs and caps women wore to cover their hair. All the married women are running around with their hair showing. Women shaved their hairlines and raised their eyebrows and covered all their hair, except for maybe a lovelock.4. The producer didn't like the men's hairstyles of the time either, which required their version of a styling wand. They all look like boys in some teeny bopper rock band.5. They all speak modern English which annoyed me very much. They sound like they just came out of my High School.6. Richard had scoliosis, which is confirmed after finding his grave.

1635779,AFOHUSVNZZ49W,B00BMRTPEM,K. Reynolds,"[0, 0]","THERE&#8217;S A WHOLE lot of history going on in this 10 episode story of Great Britain&#8217;s Wars of the Roses (1455-1487) and it all looks wonderful in glorious HD Blu-ray.Produced by the BBC and Starz, and filmed on location in Bruges, Belgium, it&#8217;s based on Philippa Gregory&#8217;s series, The Cousins War a.k.a. The Wars of the Roses, providing a fresh look at how family conflict between the Lancasters and the Yorks led to a 30-year war. Most are familiar with the story of Richard III, the crippled hunchback, supposedly responsible for the murder of his two young nephews in the Tower of London. We know the quotes from Shakespeare &#8211; &#8220;Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York&#8221; (i.e. Edward, his brother, whose symbol was the sun, then sitting on the throne of England).And we also know Richard&#8217;s end quote, &#8220;A horse &#8211; a horse! My kingdom for a horse!&#8221;&#8220;If you do know the story of the Wars of the Roses and you know it from Shakespeare, you&#8217;re in for a surprise,&#8221; says actor James Frain, who plays the &#8220;Kingmaker,&#8221; Duke of Warwick. &#8220;Shakespeare was writing under a Tudor monarchy; he was writing Tudor propaganda.&#8221;&#8220;This big, evil character we know as Richard III in Shakespearean plays wasn't that,&#8221; explains Aneurin Barnard, who plays the much-maligned Richard, Duke of York. &#8220;The real Richard III was something quite different.&#8221;And so, generally, is everyone else in this action-packed romance, even if George, Duke of Clarence (David Oakes), still drowns in a vat of malmsey (wine). The intrigue here is finding out why.Our story begins when commoner widow Elizabeth Woodville (Rebecca Ferguson), a Lancaster, and her two young sons confront king-to-be Edward of York (Max Irons, son of Jeremy). The chemistry between these two is immediate &#8211; and all but radiates from the screen. Edward has a well-earned rep as a ladies man &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m quick, I&#8217;m brave, I&#8217;m as lucky in battle as I am in love&#8221; &#8211; and Elizabeth knows the score; she will not succumb to lust, no matter how tempting, until they are married.When that happens, Kingmaker cousin Warwick goes berserk; he&#8217;s been negotiating a huge dowry and land deal with the King of France, to be delivered when Edward marries a French princess. So, when the newly crowned Edward proclaims Elizabeth queen, decisively chucking his cousin&#8217;s applecart down the mountain, Warwick does not take it well. &#8220;Edward changes the power balance of Europe over night,&#8221; Frain explains.&#8220;We are the three sons of York,&#8221; Richard declares, exasperated. &#8220;How can we be divided by one woman?&#8221;This is how wars begin. Warwick raises an army and the men of York go to battle, while and the women scheme and plot &#8211; using a nasty blast of witchcraft here and there. In the background, a very young Henry Tudor waits to see how it all plays out. His primary task is to stay alive as his mother, the obviously disturbed Margaret Beaufort (Amanda Hale), has told him he will be king &#8211; one day.If the series seems longer than a mere 10 episodes, it&#8217;s because they are so well written and there&#8217;s so much to absorb. Still, there&#8217;s no need for a degree in British history; all is well mapped out and the characters are unforgettable. Every actor does a convincing job of making his or her part come alive. Does it make a difference that we know Richard doesn't get his horse or that Henry Tudor succeeds to the throne? Not a jot. This is a fresh telling of an old story, one that many today claim to be more likely than Shakespeare&#8217;s rendition.The Blu-ray transfer is stunning; I was dazzled by the rich, intense color and magnificent detail. (We can see every freckle on Ferguson&#8217;s beautiful face, every gold bead on her coronation gown. Velvets look plush enough to sink your hands into and I&#8217;d personally like to walk barefoot through those green meadows.) Location shots are breathtaking, like the cool, birch forest where a battle takes place. Erotic scenes are well-lit and exquisitely shot. (Yes, sex scenes are a matter of taste; these are not for children.) Black levels are lush; exteriors and flesh tones look natural. We can see clouds of frosted breath, both inside and outside the castles. In no film has the chill of a medieval interior been more apparent. An immersive Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack balances dialogue, score, ambient noise and effects. Everything sounds precise yet natural.I was disappointed in the extras, however. They boasted great titles: &#8220;The Making of &#8216;The White Queen,&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;Series Overview,&#8221; &#8220;Book to Series,&#8221; &#8220;The History Behind &#8216;The White Queen,&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;Set Tour,&#8221; &#8220;Queen Elizabeth,&#8221; &#8220;King Edward IV,&#8221; &#8220;The Heir Apparent,&#8221; &#8220;Women in a Man&#8217;s World,&#8221; &#8220;Conjuring Up &#8216;The White Queen,&#8217;&#8221; and &#8220;Dressing the Queen.&#8221; But they are all promo pieces and only minutes long, with a lack of satisfying, in-depth info &#8211; only nuggets here and there.

(Humbug!) That is one crying shame, because this epic has it all: Drama, romance, betrayal, sword and ax-play, assassination, beauty and horror without launching into overwhelming gross-out.

1635782,A3THYM7XMB8B0U,B00BMRTPEM,Lola's Mom,"[1, 2]","You could say I'm a fan of Philippa Gregory. It was her The Other Boleyn Girl that introduced and hooked me on historical fiction. But this series, about the York wars, didn't interest me much. But I've been known to enjoy the movies made from books more than the books themselves at times, so I was eager to watch this. I also love a good period drama.The costumes, the acting, the twists, did not disappoint.The first two episodes, two or three hours, I think, tells about the Rivers woman of the Lancanshires. Old King Henry has been pushed aside and the throne taken by force by a York named Edward. Behind is Warwick, the &#34;Kingmaker&#34;. These episodes chronicle his rather short reign. 'Cause let's be realistic here...once the throne is taken by force and the anointed king thrown in the tower...well, you've give people ideas and shown how very easy it is... As I said at the end of watching this bit, to the rather dumb Elizabeth, &#34;What did you expect? Duh, lady.&#34;EAfter fending off her rapist, suddenly she's in love with this brute?What I hated about this: The sex. It was GROSS. And the romance between Edward and Elizabeth, while def better than what goes on between the Kingmaker's daughter and George, was yuck! Oh, they were passionate enough about each other later, but their first stages of &#34;love&#34; made me literary gag. He sees her ONCE and makes it clear, by saying it repeatedly, he must have her, that's he's desperate and even goes so far as to attempt to rape her.EdwardSomething totally flew over my head here. I didn't get it. From that point on, every time I saw them embrace, kiss, couple--and the show made it quite often. We weren't ever to forget they wanted each other's bods, badly--I cringed.Just YUCK.But all that aside, the court intrigue, the moving around of lands to those Elizabeth favors, the witchcraftery, and then a young Henry's mother keeps the pace moving and kept me intrigued.Margaret, Henry's mother....what a horrid character. I liked her better in the book, whereas the Rivers women, I liked them better in the movie. The magic was cooler in the movie too, whereas it felt out of place in the novel. Especially liked the storm...While Margaret is super irritating, her young Henry stole my heart. But then the show had to ruin that by impression by showing an older Henry &#34;going at&#34; a woman from behind. What's with all the sex and nudity? I think we can get the idea without it being so vulgar.You either love the characters or hate them, with passion. Great acting. They really sucked me into the tale. Oh, I wanted to slap Anne Neville.It seems to me, however, that they pretty much summed up all three of PG's books, so what's going to be covered in season two? Are they just going to continue until they cover her Tudor series too?I liked it, didn't LOVE it, but liked it. I would watch season two if it came my way, but I don't think I'd pay for it.",3,"Engrossing, Superb Acting and Costumes, but a Tad Overly Vulgar",1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,2935,"['could', 'say', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Philippa', 'Gregory', 'was', 'Other', 'Boleyn', 'Girl', 'introduced', 'hooked', 'historical', 'fiction', 'series', 'York', 'wars', 'did', ""n't"", 'interest', 'much', ""'ve"", 'been', 'known', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'made', 'books', 'more', 'books', 'times', 'was', 'eager', 'watch', 'also', 'love', 'good', 'period', 'drama.The', 'costumes', 'acting', 'twists', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint.The', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'two', 'three', 'hours', 'think', 'Rivers', 'woman', 'Lancanshires', 'Old', 'King', 'Henry', 'been', 'pushed', 'aside', 'throne', 'taken', 'force', 'York', 'named', 'Edward', 'Behind', 'Warwick', '34', 'Kingmaker', '34', 'episodes', 'chronicle', 'rather', 'short', 'reign', 'let', 'be', 'realistic', 'here', 'once', 'throne', 'taken', 'force', 'anointed', 'king', 'thrown', 'tower', 'well', ""'ve"", 'give', 'people', 'ideas', 'shown', 'how', 'very', 'easy', 'said', 'end', 'watching', 'bit', 'rather', 'dumb', 'Elizabeth', '34', 'What', 'did', 'expect', 'Duh', 'lady.', '34', 'EAfter', 'fending', 'off', 'rapist', 'suddenly', 'love', 'brute', 'What', 'hated', 'sex', 'was', 'GROSS', 'romance', 'Edward', 'Elizabeth', 'def', 'better', 'what', 'Kingmaker', 'daughter', 'George', 'was', 'yuck', 'Oh', 'were', 'passionate', 'enough', 'other', 'later', 'first', 'stages', '34', 'love', '34', 'made', 'literary', 'gag', 'ONCE', 'clear', 'saying', 'repeatedly', 'must', 'have', 'desperate', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'attempt', 'rape', 'her.EdwardSomething', 'totally', 'flew', 'head', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'point', 'time', 'saw', 'embrace', 'kiss', 'couple', 'show', 'made', 'quite', 'often', 'were', ""n't"", 'ever', 'forget', 'wanted', 'other', 'bods', 'badly', 'cringed.Just', 'YUCK.But', 'aside', 'court', 'intrigue', 'moving', 'lands', 'Elizabeth', 'favors', 'witchcraftery', 'then', 'young', 'Henry', 'mother', 'pace', 'moving', 'kept', 'intrigued.Margaret', 'Henry', 'mother', '.what', 'horrid', 'character', 'liked', 'better', 'book', 'Rivers', 'women', 'liked', 'better', 'movie', 'magic', 'was', 'cooler', 'movie', 'too', 'felt', 'place', 'novel', 'Especially', 'liked', 'storm', 'Margaret', 'super', 'irritating', 'young', 'Henry', 'stole', 'heart', 'then', 'show', 'had', 'ruin', 'impression', 'showing', 'older', 'Henry', '34', 'going', '34', 'woman', 'behind', 'What', 'sex', 'nudity', 'think', 'can', 'get', 'idea', 'being', 'so', 'vulgar.You', 'love', 'characters', 'hate', 'passion', 'Great', 'acting', 'really', 'sucked', 'tale', 'Oh', 'wanted', 'slap', 'Anne', 'Neville.It', 'however', 'pretty', 'much', 'summed', 'up', 'three', 'PG', 'books', 'what', 'going', 'be', 'covered', 'season', 'two', 'Are', 'just', 'going', 'continue', 'cover', 'Tudor', 'series', 'too', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'LOVE', 'liked', 'would', 'watch', 'season', 'two', 'came', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'pay']","The White Queen - Complete Series The White Queen: Series 1  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"

1635785,A2MF2QVSCUI27G,B00BMRTPEM,"Luan Gaines ""luansos""","[0, 0]","Following the current trend in historical fiction, the first season of The White Queen sets the  stage for the great drama of England's War of the Roses (1464). Like Philippa Gregory, Alison Weir and others, the series looks behind the scenes to the women behind the historical figures that dominate England's politics and the warring houses of Lancaster and York, Elizabeth Woodville, commoner wife of Edward IV, Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII and Anne Neville, wife of Richard III.For those familiar with this fascinating and volatile era in English history, the casting is critical, setting the stage for well-known characters. While I was disappointed with the choice of actress for Woodville, Rebecca Ferguson, the role of her mother, Jacquetta, was perfectly captured by Janet Mc Teer. Pairing Ferguson with Max Irons as Richard IV, produced the required chemistry, but I felt some of the historical detail was sacrificed in favor of romance. However, Amanda Hale portrayed the pious Margaret Beaufort to perfection. Many viewers are inspired by historical dramas to research further, but there is always the risk of mistaking an embellished tale for fact, a traumatic era made more palatable by the attractive leads and their shocking love affair. Beyond the early days with Edward, Woodville was a formidable presence, capable of much mischief and politically sophisticated by the time her daughter, Elizabeth was wed to Henry VII.As for cinematography and special effects, I have fewer expectations of Starz when viewing these epic historical dramas. As in the past (the Ken Follett epic), I found the sets less elaborate, the crowds sparser in mob  and combat scenes and the interiors less detailed, a situation perhaps dictated by budget. HBO, in contrast, pulls out all the stops (Game of Thrones), lavishing as much energy on atmosphere as on script and characters, as did Showtime for The Tudors. Aside from issues of historical accuracy, such attention to detail often makes a difference in the visual and emotional impact of the experience (the exception being the staging of classic Shakespeare plays, which require little else but the superior acting they inspire). I thought the costumes in The White Queen were questionable as well, Woodville's daytime frocks much less modest that what the period demanded- though more convenient for secret trysts with Richard. I was hoping for solid history, but often heard the violins of a Regency Romance.As expected, Special Features round out the DVD, adding context to the history, characterization, and visual challenges of the series: The Making of The White Queen, Series Overview, Book To Series, The History Behind The White Queen, The White Queen: Set Tour, Queen Elizabeth, The King, The Heir Apparent, Woman In A Man's World, Conjuring Up The Queen/Magic, Dressing The Queen/Wardrobe.

That particular period of time in history has always drawn me for some reason&#8230;I&#8217;m not sure why.  Thankfully, there are plenty of titles available to keep my interest sharp:  PILLARS OF THE EARTH, THE TUDORS, just to mention a couple, and now THE WHITE QUEEN.  I have to admit, though:  of all the titles I&#8217;ve watched, THE WHITE QUEEN is now one of my favorites!I honestly wasn&#8217;t expecting to like this series as much as I do.  It is gripping and raw, just like the subject matter of which it is about.  And the production value appears very high, which in turn makes for a more believable, and therefore enjoyable, series.THE WHITE QUEEN is shot well and looks great onscreen.  There&#8217;s no doubt Starz spares no expense when it comes to this show, and the result is a realistic depiction of a dark time in Europe&#8217;s history.  There&#8217;s more throne-hopping and power-grab attempts in this show than a soap opera.  And, what&#8217;s even better:  this show is based on fact.I cannot say just how much of the show is based on true events, but I have done enough research to know the primary basis itself is sound.  These events did happen and involved the characters that we get to see onscreen.  But as for the particulars&#8230;the writers might have taken a few liberties here and there&#8230;I&#8217;m just not sure.  Regardless, this show is full of drama, backstabbing, power clashes, battles, and romance.  You just can&#8217;t ask for much more!The acting in THE WHITE QUEEN is superb, with Rebecca Ferguson portraying the titular character.  Ferguson does an amazing job with her role, giving a fully convincing version of Queen Elizabeth.  The rest of the cast is stellar as well, with particularly memorable performances by James Frain as Lord Warwick &#8220;The Kingmaker&#8221;, Max Irons as King Edward, and Janet McTeer as Elizabeth&#8217;s mother, Jacquetta Woodville.My sole complaint about the show is that it starts off pretty fast-paced before it finally slows down around the third episode or so.  This is a minor complaint, and I understand why it is done:  the events that lead up to the turmoil are only secondary in the show, and the production team has to quickly set the tone and basis for the show itself.  Still, I do feel it worth mentioning, just so you&#8217;re not caught off guard should you give the show a look.And I highly recommend that you do.  THE WHITE QUEEN is one of my favorite shows out right now, and I am looking forward to season two.

1635790,A1EUFCOZLSAWZP,B00BMRTPEM,Medieval Lady,"[43, 78]","Having studied the Wars of the Roses at University was interested this show. On some superficial level, there is a hint of a good story in this series though I cannot comment upon Philipa Gregory's skill as a writer, having never read her works. There were also some interesting characters who one could almost grow to care for and have their moments, and the whole thing looks good.It might even have been passable as an average sword and sorcery style fantasy series (though I don't like such things) but it is actually supposed to be `historical', which may be the gravest error of all, alongside the reliance on sex to `spice' things up, and content which could be an insult to the intelligence as well as the past.Given that for a drama that is supposed to span some 21 years, most of the characters do not seem to age, and still look twenty after decades. The characters either seemed to have an uncanny knack for anticipating the course of events or telling each other how they would pan out, or had to explain details we may not otherwise understand the significance of.Like some self-absorbed celebrity King Edward's character may have just expected everyone to fawn over his wonderfulness, or thought his political rivals ought to thank him for usurping the throne and killing their family members. As we were continually told, he supposedly bought `peace' to the country which may have  seemed rather implausible when he was faced with rebellion or had to go off and fight in almost every episode up to the fifth, and considering how the Yorkists started the hostilities in first place.The over-simplification of the conflict and political realities of the period is coupled with characters who whilst they seemed very adept at spouting Yorkist propaganda, yet appeared ignorant of historical facts and events they are meant to have taken part in.  Thus it was claimed that the war was started to `get rid of Henry', when in fact this was not the aim of the Yorkists at all initially, and that for the first five years of the conflict (1455-60) their avowed intention was mainly to bring about political reform- repeatedly attesting their loyalty to King Henry all while.Given that Warwick played a major role in the events of this period he ought to have known this, but seems to suffer from a form of selective amnesia that afflicts several of the characters. Nor it seems could Edward and Clarence decide how their father was actually killed, claiming he was had his head hacked off or was torn apart respectively, unaware of the fact that he was killed in battle and beheaded afterwards.I for one think there's something extremely unfair about presenting King Henry as a madman who nobody wanted, without acknowledging that he was not mad for most of his reign, and his dynasty had ruled England for over 60 years, during which time there had been no major battles on English soil for over four decades.Yet we are supposed to believe that the Yorkists, who were aggressors at the first such battle in 1455 'bought peace' to England. Strange definition of peace.....Then there's the unfortunate Margaret of Anjou, whom this series seems to carry on the centuries old tradition of vilifying. There's no evidence for instance that Anne Neville was treated cruelly by her. Though George and Edward seem convinced that she killed their father, when she was acually in Scotland at that particular battle, and of course she is condemned as a `tyrant'. Even as a reflection of the time, there seems to be something grossly hypocritical about men who had few moral qualms about killing or executing their own cousins and even siblings whining about a woman having acted as ruthlessly as they did  towards her political opponents, and daring to fight to defend or reclaim her son's inheritance.Logically it would seem that the Yorkists had no right to raise moral objection to execution when they beheaded people themselves, but object they do, Anne Neville labelling Prince Edward of Lancaster a `monster' on the basis of a story about him having had two men executed at the age of seven, when in fact he only passed judgement on the persons in question. It seems however that the less than admirable deeds of the Yorkists are frequently glossed over, or not mentioned at all.For this reason perhaps no mention is made of the 35 nobles and knights who were killed or executed at Tewkesbury. In the latter case King Edward possibly wither violated sanctuary, or committed perjury by promising the defeated nobles in the Abbey would be spared. Instead, such battles come across as easy victories for York against a tiny army who for some absurd reason have to resort to taking strategic advice from whining teenage girl with no military experience, instead of the seasoned fighters amidst their ranks, though most of these were not present in the drama of course. The one battle that does feature prominently is Bosworth- for some odd reason fought in a wood.Apparently though it's acceptable to place curses on people and seek assistance from obscure water goddesses when difficulties arise. Praying and talking of God's will, however, apparently makes a person a ranting fantastic, and fighting for one's rights a tyrant- if they happen to support Lancaster.  It is perhaps notable, as another reviewer pointed out that the witches, Elizabeth and her mother and daughters are the `tragic heroines' of the series, whose vindictiveness almost seems to be excused.Conversely, apparently in keeping with the BBC's tradition of Christian bashing the devout Margaret Beaufort is presented an unscrupulous Machiavellian villain willing to go to literally any lengths to achieve her ends, with nobody considering that her belief in God's will, and divine intervention of human affairs might have been quite normal in the 1400s.Of course there's no evidence that Elizabeth ever practiced witchcraft, but who wants to let the facts get in the way of a good story when there's plenty of rumour, speculation or outright falsehood to colour the narrative? The greatest of all such speculation has to be that Margaret Beaufort, in league with Lord Stanley was behind the deaths of the Princes in the Tower. Any theory is apparently preferable to implying that their dear Uncle Richard may have been responsible, which would upset the Richard III society after all.No, it is absolutely stated that a character who helped murder a helpless elderly man is his bed could absolutely never have murdered his helpless innocent nephews. Even his own besotted niece was convinced he could not have done it, seeming to conveniently forget how he had her half-brother and Uncle executed when acting as his apologist. The rumours of their incestuous liaison are made out to have been a ruse designed to discredit Henry Tudor, though incredibly they don't seem to reflect badly on Richard or damage his reputation.Instances of the downright stupidity of the characters (like Anne Neville deciding to ride off on her own into the aftermath of a battle) or this series could be highlighted, but this review is already rather long.Yet I fear that in the legacy of other dire pseudo-historcal dramatic offerings this will influence's people perceptions of the Wars of the Roses for years to come.Anyone interested in gaining a genuine understanding of this period would be much better off seeking a good non-fiction book, and avoiding this series like the proverbial plague.",1,"Sex, fantasy and Yorkist

The Wars of the (red and white) Roses, brilliantly dramatized by Shakespeare in several of his history plays, was a conflict between the powerful York and Lancaster houses for control of the crown of England, and was one of the most important struggles in England's illustrious, storied past.Based on a popular novel by Philippa Gregory, The White Queen recounts a fictionalized version of the political tensions that were the seedbed from which modern England sprung. It is superb drama, regardless of whether or not it is strictly authentic (it isn't). The writing is excellent, the acting brilliant (as is usual for an English production) and the production values and cinematography are stunning to look at.This series is most definitely worth watching, regardless of the medium you choose. However, if you are able to purchase the Blu-Ray discs rather than the standard definition DVDs, you will find the high-definition version gorgeous to look at and infinitely more engrossing. The beauty and pageantry of late-Medieval England seems to come alive with remarkable vivacity as the intensity of colors, textures and sounds takes a quantum leap upwards. Large screen televisions will appreciate Blu-Ray high-definition images and if you screen your films through a home-theater system, you will find the improved focal accuracy and increased naturalness of high-definition audio to frequently catch your breath, it is that good.",5,A superb popular history lesson,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",2014,1593,"['was', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'premium', 'television', 'networks', 'Starz', 'discovered', 'drama', 'pageantry', 'inherent', 'great', 'moments', 'English', 'history', 'Wars', 'red', 'white', 'Roses', 'brilliantly', 'dramatized', 'Shakespeare', 'several', 'history', 'plays', 'was', 'conflict', 'powerful', 'York', 'Lancaster', 'houses', 'control', 'crown', 'England', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'struggles', 'England', 'illustrious', 'storied', 'past.Based', 'popular', 'novel', 'Philippa', 'Gregory', 'White', 'Queen', 'fictionalized', 'version', 'political', 'tensions', 'were', 'seedbed', 'modern', 'England', 'sprung', 'superb', 'drama', 'regardless', 'not', 'strictly', 'authentic', ""n't"", 'writing', 'excellent', 'acting', 'brilliant', 'usual', 'English', 'production', 'production', 'values', 'cinematography', 'are', 'stunning', 'look', 'at.This', 'series', 'most', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'regardless', 'medium', 'choose', 'However', 'are', 'able', 'purchase', 'Blu-Ray', 'discs', 'rather', 'standard', 'definition', 'DVDs', 'will', 'find', 'high-definition', 'version', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'infinitely', 'more', 'engrossing', 'beauty', 'pageantry', 'late-Medieval', 'England', 'come', 'alive', 'remarkable', 'vivacity', 'intensity', 'colors', 'textures', 'quantum', 'leap', 'upwards', 'Large', 'screen', 'televisions', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Blu-Ray', 'high-definition', 'images', 'screen', 'films', 'home-theater', 'system', 'will', 'find', 'improved', 'focal', 'accuracy', 'increased', 'naturalness', 'high-definition', 'audio', 'frequently', 'catch', 'breath', 'good']","The White Queen - Complete Series The White Queen: Series 1  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"

I also, personally, think there was just way too much gratuitous sex. Yeah, I know it was on cable, but still.I found this series so much more enjoyable than The Tudors. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve read more nonfiction about the Tudor era so the historical inaccuracies were more grating to me; or maybe I just find the Wars of the Roses stranger than fiction&#8230;Yes, you can make this stuff up, but isn&#8217;t it crazy to think this is (more or less) how it really happened? Because fiction or not, there is historical fact here.And yes, I read and loved the Philippa Gregory books (again, as historical FICTION), and was happy that there were much fewer mentions of the goddess Melusina in the show. THANK YOU.SPECIAL FEATURES: There are a bunch of special features on the DVD, but each is less than 5 minutes and some of the information/interviews overlap. My favorite was the feature about the sets; it&#8217;s awesome how they built the corridors and rooms that could be swapped out for other rooms.

1635799,AT0E6UBVJMJ6W,B00BMRTPEM,Ms Winston,"[0, 0]","I found this series to be very faithful to the novel ""The White Queen,"" the first of Ms Gregory's series on the War of the Roses. It is told from the point of view of the women, and in this series two women in particular --- Elizabeth Woodville, Queen of England (Rebecca Ferguson), and Margaret Beaufort (Amanda Hale), the mother of Henry VII. Those who criticize the program due to some historical inaccuracies are, in my opinion, missing the point -- neither the series, or the books upon which it based, are suppose to be history lessons, but rather are entertainment based upon historical events. Anyone who has read Ms Gregory's Tudor novels knows that she puts a particular spin of her own upon historical figures...from whether Catherine of Aragon and Prince Arthur consummated their marriage to whether Elizabeth I could rightly be termed the Virgin Queen. If historical accuracy trumps what is meant as pure entertainment, then this may not be the series for you.It is my understanding that the first season of The White Queen is also going to be the last season. It was, from what I have been able to research on the Internet, a two season program that was not renewed after the first season. I think that is a shame, as the first season was quite well done in my opinion. The cast is excellent, especially James Frain as Warwick the King Maker (and I am glad that his hair covers his ears, as they can be distracting). It is difficult to recreate battle scenes on the small screen, but I think there were enough that the viewer had a good perspective on what actually happened. I, too, noticed the presence of a zipper in one shot when the perspective queen was viewed from the back -- that was very careless on the part of the costume designer, as this is not live television where anything could happen. I did not see that repeated in later scenes. The love story of Elizabeth Woodville and Edward IV (the handsome and talented Max Irons) was quite well done -- the beautiful couple of their day. Rebecca Ferguson was absolutely gorgeous and a very expressive actress. I am glad to have this miniseries as part of my personal DVD library will no doubt watch it again and again. For the purists among us, just remember that these events took place almost 600 years ago, and over time facts become distorted.

The character of Edward IV was not as compelling as I had hoped, and there was an excess of sex here. I'm not trying to be prudish, but the people who put together this release seemed to believe that it was necessary to stop the action periodically to show more skin.

I did not watch it with a historian's eye (I am sure there are many quibbles to be had) but simply as a viewer. The acting was first rate and the pacing perfect. One of the challenges in portraying the point of view of the women of history is that so little of our story is documented in the same way as the men's role. This series was very successful in turning the lens around so that those without rights and choices told a version of their story.The constant theme of women being married off and used as breeding stock was not overstated. I liked how the episodes revealed what historical characters chose to do with those roles. I was particularly riveted by the portrayals of Margaret Beaufort, Elizabeth Woodville and her mother.I enjoyed the cinematography, the costuming and the realism of birth and death. I often had to go to reference books to figure out  who was related to whom. That did not distract from my enjoyment of this series. This period of British history was so volatile that fortunes and favors changed moment to moment. The series handled that very well.I'd recommend this to anyone interested in a different spin on the English history.

1635814,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00BMRTPEM,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[61, 68]","Forget historical accuracy. Done that? Good, because ""The White Queen"" has very little, even less so than the books by Philippa Gregory upon which they are based. The sooner you accept that, the more you can enjoy a mini-series that doesn't claim to be anything but a loose dramatization of the War of the Roses, starting from 1464 with the meeting of King Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville, and ending with the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.The time was ripe for a dramatization of the War of the Roses given the immense popularity ofGeorge R. R. Martin's A Game of Thronesand the subsequent HBO television adaptation, for the author has made no secret of how much this period of English history inspired his own work of fiction. In fact, for fans of the books, it's hard not to watch ""The White Queen"" without drawing correlations between the two: Henry Tudor's situation is very much like that of Daenerys Targaryen, whilst Robert Baratheon seems to owe his existence to King Edward IV. Cersei Lannister might well be a less-than-kind depiction of the titular White Queen, and even the emblem of the famous rose sigils of Lancaster and York can be found in the fictional Tyrells' standard. It stands to reason that if you enjoy one, you'll enjoy the other.But what ""The White Queen"" brings to the table is an emphasis on the women that were involved in the period, namely Elizabeth Woodville (wife of King Edward), Anne Neville (daughter of the man known as ""the kingmaker"") and Margaret Beauford (mother of Henry Tudor). Far from being passive observers to the drama, the mini-series makes good on its promise to depict the events from their eyes, and has them right in the midst of the intrigue and violence that characterizes this tumultuous period.Worth noting however is that this is not so much a miniseries about the War of the Roses, but an adaptation of author/historian Philippa Gregory's take on the events in question. Based on three of her books:The White Queen,The Red QueenandThe Kingmaker's Daughter, various plot-points and characters are based on *her* specific understanding of what really happened, a relatively important distinction to keep in mind when you watch. Some historical figures are cast in an unsympathetic light (poor Duchess Cecily gets the worst of it, portrayed here as an embittered old harridan), whilst others can come across as noble heroes or helpless victims. Gregory's rather notorious reputation for distorting the facts to suit her favourites or to increase the levels of drama (seriously, don't believe *anything* you see in this show regarding Richard III's relationship with Elizabeth of York) means that everything seen here should be taken with a pinch of salt.But you could have probably assumed some degree of historical inaccuracy simply by watching. From the perfect skin and whitened teeth of the actors, to the visible drainpipes on the buildings and rubber-soled boots worn by the men, to the inexplicable decision to film the Battle of Bosworth FIELD in what is clearly a FOREST, there's not a huge amount of effort in keeping it realistic.But the main points of what became known as the War of the Roses are all touched upon: the controversial marriage of King Edward to Elizabeth Woodville, the Mad King and the Bad Queen, the on-going warfare between York and Lancastrian households, George of Clarence's execution, the mystery of the Princes in the Tower, Richard's stressful reign as king, and finally the invasion of Henry Tudor's forces.Emerging from the ensemble cast are several stand-outs: James Frain as a scheming Lord Warwick, Rupert Graves (best known as Lestrade fromSherlock) as the opportunistic Lord Stanley, and Rebecca Ferguson as the titular White Queen, who combines beauty and charisma with steel and fire. Veerle Baetens also has a small but unforgettable role as Margaret of Anjou.For me however, it's Aneurin Barnard as King Richard III and Amanda Hale as Margaret Beauford who really steal the show. Barnard's portrayal of Richard throws him into a far more sympathetic light than what we are used to, freeing the man from the most famous depiction of him as the black-hearted villain in Shakespeare's play. Here Richard is an honourable but conflicted man, grappling with a fraught political situation and driven to the edge by circumstances: the product of bad luck, wrong-headed decisions, treacherous counsel, and enduring rumours surrounding the disappearance of his nephews that he cannot be rid of.Hale depicts Margaret Beaufort as a terrifyingly fanatical woman, engrained with the belief that her son Henry Tudor is destined to be king and not afraid to stamp out anyone who might get in the way of that. Combining hypocrisy with sincere piety, ruthlessness with moments of regret, and godliness in the struggle against her own vanity, she ends up dominating every scene she's in. If there is one weak note it's that Henry Tudor is not given particularly strong characterization, and for such a pivotal figure in the drama he ends up too bland to garner much of an opinion of him one way or the other.Because of the format of the miniseries, several established characters drop from the action without warning once their roles are complete: Duchess Cecily, Margaret of Anjou and the Countess of Warwick are such narrative casualities, and you'll have to turn to Wikipedia to get an idea of their eventual fates. Likewise, the ending itself is quite abrupt, and it'll be interesting to see if Starz will follow through on its promise to adapt Philippa Gregory'sThe White Princessin order to continue the story of the surviving characters.Speaking of which, it's worth pointing out that the Starz and BBC versions of ""The White Queen"" differ in a number of ways. The Americans were treated to more racy sex scenes, but there were also a few other bits and pieces that were either deleted or added, including a scene that puts an entirely new spin on what was really going on between Richard III and Elizabeth of York.There's no doubt that even though the men are the movers and shakers, the women are the protagonists, with a particular emphasis on how they try to negotiate the pathways of influence and power. Whatever else you may think of the miniseries as quality television or as an accurate depiction of the period, I can appreciate that the women remain the focus throughout, something that's still rare enough in historical dramas to warrant praise.",4,"""You Will Be Queen of England, as I Once Was...""",1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,6456,"['Forget', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Done', 'Good', 'White',

1635815,A14JRNU2JVRBPA,B00BMRTPEM,Robert K. Pavlick,"[0, 0]","For those who love English history and are fascinated by detail, accurate costuming and flawless reenactment of history, this is a wonderful work of art. The casting and characterization was marvelous. For those who may feel that Richard III has always been given a bad rap by the Tudor historians, this work pretty much vindicates him or at least shows that there were many other family members near the crown who wanted the two boys in the Tower to be dead; not least of which was Margaret Beaufort.I do have to admit, that it does help substantially if you are a history buff and familiar with the characters before watching this series, because it can be a tad confusing with so many of the people's names and physical appearances being similar. Also, as was common in the 15th century, people are called sometimes by their actual names, sometimes by their titles, and sometimes by where they were from. For example, George, the brother of Richard III and King Edward IV may be called at different points: George Plantagenet, George of York, the Duke of Clarence, the 1st Earl of Salisbury, or  the 1st Earl of Warwick when his father-in-law before him was also the Earl of Warwick, so it can be a bit confusing.But over all, as I said, for English history enthusiasts and supporters of Richard III, it is a marvelous series with hours of enjoyment. I learned a lot from it. One always thinks of the powerful men in history, but this work shows that at least during the Wars of the Roses, one must not forget that much of the results and the end result, in particular, were controlled from behind the scenes by some very courageous, determined and very powerful women.",5,For those who love English history and are fascinated by detail,1404950400,"07 10, 2014",2014,1672,"['who', 'love', 'English', 'history', 'are', 'fascinated', 'detail', 'accurate', 'costuming', 'flawless', 'reenactment', 'history', 'wonderful', 'work', 'art', 'casting', 'characterization', 'was', 'marvelous', 'who', 'may', 'feel', 'Richard', 'III', 'always', 'been', 'given', 'bad', 'rap', 'Tudor', 'historians', 'work', 'pretty', 'much', 'least', 'shows', 'were', 'many', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'crown', 'who', 'wanted', 'two', 'boys', 'Tower', 'be', 'dead', 'not', 'least', 'was', 'Margaret', 'Beaufort.I', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'help', 'substantially', 'are', 'history', 'buff', 'familiar', 'characters', 'watching', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'tad', 'confusing', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'names', 'physical', 'appearances', 'being', 'similar', 'Also', 'was', 'common', '15th', 'century', 'people', 'are', 'called', 'sometimes', 'actual', 'names', 'sometimes', 'titles', 'sometimes', 'where', 'were', 'example', 'George', 'brother', 'Richard', 'III', 'King', 'Edward', 'IV', 'may', 'be', 'called', 'different', 'points', 'George', 'Plantagenet', 'George', 'York', 'Duke', 'Clarence', '1st', 'Earl', 'Salisbury', '1st', 'Earl', 'Warwick', 'when', 'father-in-law', 'was', 'also', 'Earl', 'Warwick', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'confusing.But', 'said', 'English', 'history', 'enthusiasts', 'supporters', 'Richard', 'III', 'marvelous', 'series', 'hours', 'enjoyment', 'learned', 'lot', 'One', 'always', 'powerful', 'men', 'history', 'work', 'least', 'Wars', 'Roses', 'one', 'must', 'not', 'forget', 'much', 'results', 'end', 'result', 'particular', 'were', 'controlled', 'scenes', 'very', 'courageous', 'determined', 'very', 'powerful', 'women']","The White Queen - Complete Series The White Queen: Series 1  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"

1635817,A2UYGOYMV73826,B00BMRTPEM,Rushmore,"[4, 4]","If you are looking for lots of pageantry and glory, this is not your show.  If you like intrigue, backstabbing and lots of characters to keep track of, this one is for you.I watched this show with a history buff who felt that it was accurate for the most part.  Honestly, the first couple of hours were slow going and I wondered how I was ever going to get through all 10 hours, but I got more involved as time progressed.I have to say that none of the 3 major female characters who are the prisms of the story is especially sympathetic.  Elizabeth Rivers, the queen of Edward V, is a witch, no bones about it.  Her mother and daughter also have 'the gift"".  Between them they cast their spells and levy their curses to affect the course of history.  (Elizabeth's bloodline carries through to the British monarchy of the present day.)  Margaret, mother of Henry Tudor who would go on to become Henry VII, is pious but does not hesitate to let God know when she's not pleased with the way He's managing things.  She knows the way things should be and it's God's will and she has no problem manipulating events and people to make everything turn out right.  Finally Anne the daughter of the Earl of Warwick who marries Richard III is an innocent girl at the beginning and by the end she is pulling all the strings.  The Richard of this series is different from Shakespeare's Richard.  Although he is mildly sympathetic at the beginning, he proves to be a weak and suggestible ruler.I was excited to see that James Frain was in this show.  I loved his quirky, adorable performance as Forney in Where the Heart Is.  The pivotal role of the Earl of Warwick, the Kingmaker, could not be more different.  Here he is without scruples, one of those characters that makes your blood run cold.  It's a powerful performance but completely unsympathetic.This show is way more mud and blood than pretty costumes and masked balls.  Of the special features, the one with the most content other than simply promoting the show is the feature about the costumes.  We get good insight into a costume designer's approach to a large, sprawling period piece.There is a fair amount of nudity in this production, mostly female.  It feels authentic, and most of it is not romanticized.  Something to keep in mind if you are planning to spend 10 hours with this show.Although no character is whitewashed - actually pretty much the opposite - the women get a particularly raw deal in this production.  Even setting aside the fact that most parties involve a naked woman or two happily bouncing on top of a (semi) naked man, it's made quite clear that this is a man's world.  Queen Elizabeth can control nature through her witchcraft but she cannot control her husband.  (Incidentally, the historical perspective is that Elizabeth and her mother were accused but not convicted of witchcraft.)  Amanda Hale's performance as Margaret of Beaufort is so twitchy and neurotic.  Although she eventually got what she wanted and did not lose faith that it would happen, she is ultimately a hypocrite, and her husband made things happen more than she could.  Anne Neville is the most intriguing of the three major female characters.  We see her grow from a spunky young girl with a lot of potential, to a rather bitter and dour adult woman.  Her marriage to Richard III which was initially a rather sweet love match develops into a power struggle.  Anne has a more forceful personality but Richard is still the King.  Because this is such a political environment and ultimately not at all favorable to women, feminists might want to know going in that they will find a lot to get angry about.Philippa Gregory is well known for turning history into soap opera.  The White Queen is pretty true to history while emphasizing its most sensational plot points.  Although this series has ""Season 1"" in its name, the BBC did not order a second season.

(It also shows lots of R rated his 'n' hers nudity, but I digress.) The setting is the 30-year War of the Roses, a battle between two royal families--the House of Lancaster and the House of Tudor--for the throne of England. Our story opens with the new young Tudor King Edward IV shocking his flock by marrying Elizabeth Woodville, who's not only a Lancastrian, but a commoner!!!In short order, many of the King's loyal Tudor honchos--most particularly his advisor Lord Warwick--will jump ship and plot against him. Margaret Beaufort, of the House of Lancaster, who had always believed herself destined to be queen, has now determined instead that it's God's will that her young son Henry is meant for the English throne and it's her job to see that he gets there. Meanwhile, the new Queen Elizabeth quickly makes it clear that she's wearing the crown and taking no guff from anyone, including her new mother in law.I was especially glad to see that Richard III, who became king after Edward's death, is NOT portrayed here as the hunchbacked villain and murderer of the young princes in the Tower--a characterization that Shakespeare created to curry favor with the monarchy he was then serving.

This is a miniseries which  follows the War of the Roses, as seen through the eyes of the women involved.  They are cunning, bright, plotting, cruel and very much a part of history in this series.  If you are looking for true history, this is not it.  Nobody is covered in lice, with their teeth falling out and dying of horrid diseases.  Almost everyone has clear skin.  That alone makes it not historically accurate.  If you are a stickler for historical accuracy, some of this show will annoy you.  If you are looking for entertainment, and a little bit of history flavor and a lot of intelligent women who try to make the best of the situations into which they have been placed you will enjoy this series.There is sex.  You see naked butts and breasts, but no full frontal nudity.  Apparently in the US version we got a few seconds more of male butts (which the Brits complained about missing out on).I could care less if my teen kids see a nipple , butt or even consensual sex between adults.  I do still monitor non- consensual sex in films for my 15 year old, but mostly because rape is really violence and not sex.  And for my husband and I, violence is the issue.  I do object to my kids seeing people raped, chopped up, attacked, bayonetted, shot, stabbed, or their heads cut off, especially when the reason seems to simply generate more blood.  Heads chopped off in a movie about revolutionary France, fine.  Heads chopped off by helicopter blades just to look cool, no.  While someday I hope for sex to be part of their lives, I would hope that this level of violence will never be.  My daughter told me one night that we were SO the opposite of her all friends parents, they are banned from movies with sex, while we carefully screen the violence.  My sister lives in Europe, and it is funny how the ratings are so different.  It is considered fine for there to be nudity in a movie for teens, but not extreme violence.  I have found that IMBD is really useful, they have a section about parent warnings so we can check if the R rating is for sex (who cares) or violence (in which case I can check out the level).  Since IMBD did not provide much in the way of review, I will point out here that there is ironically more sex in this series than Americans are used to and less actual observed violence.  There are head choppings, but because there WERE head choppings in history, and they do not show you gruesome images.Not to say there is no violence, but the camera cuts away before the blood and gore.The witchcraft part is distracting, and I think the series could have done without it.In the states this would certainly be R and maybe even NC-17 for the sex, but paradoxically (considering the era in which it was set ) it would probably be PG-13 if rated only for violence.",5,"Women using everything they have, cunning, intelligence, manipulation, sex and political plotting to obtain and keep power.",1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,2889,"['watched', 'series', 'just', 'turned', '15', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'loved', 'enjoyed', 'miniseries', 'War', 'Roses', 'seen', 'eyes', 'women', 'involved', 'are', 'cunning', 'bright', 'plotting', 'cruel', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'history', 'series', 'are', 'looking', 'true', 'history', 'not', 'Nobody', 'covered', 'lice', 'teeth', 'falling', 'out', 'dying', 'horrid', 'diseases', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'clear', 'skin', 'alone', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'are', 'stickler', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'show', 'will', 'annoy', 'are', 'looking', 'entertainment', 'little', 'bit', 'history', 'flavor', 'lot', 'intelligent', 'women', 'who', 'try', 'make', 'best', 'situations', 'have', 'been', 'placed', 'will', 'enjoy', 'series.There', 'sex', 'see', 'naked', 'butts', 'breasts', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'Apparently', 'US', 'version', 'got', 'few', 'seconds', 'more', 'male', 'butts', 'Brits', 'complained', 'missing', 'out', '.I', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'teen', 'kids', 'see', 'nipple', 'butt', 'even', 'consensual', 'sex', 'adults', 'do', 'still', 'monitor', 'non-', 'consensual', 'sex', 'films', '15', 'year', 'old', 'mostly', 'rape', 'really', 'violence', 'not', 'sex', 'husband', 'violence', 'issue', 'do', 'object', 'kids', 'seeing', 'people', 'raped', 'chopped', 'up', 'attacked', 'bayonetted', 'shot', 'stabbed', 'heads', 'cut', 'off', 'especially', 'when', 'reason', 'simply', 'generate', 'more', 'blood', 'Heads', 'chopped', 'off', 'movie', 'revolutionary', 'France', 'fine', 'Heads', 'chopped', 'off', 'helicopter', 'blades', 'just', 'look', 'cool', 'someday', 'hope', 'sex', 'be', 'part', 'lives', 'would', 'hope', 'level', 'violence', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'daughter', 'told', 'one', 'night', 'were', 'SO', 'opposite', 'friends', 'parents', 'are', 'banned', 'movies', 'sex', 'carefully', 'screen', 'violence', 'sister', 'lives', 'Europe', 'funny', 'how', 'ratings', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'considered', 'fine', 'be', 'nudity', 'movie', 'teens', 'not', 'extreme', 'violence', 'have', 'found', 'IMBD', 'really', 'useful', 'have', 'section', 'parent', 'warnings', 'can', 'check', 'R', 'rating', 'sex', 'who', 'violence', 'case', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'level', 'IMBD', 'did', 'not', 'provide', 'much', 'way', 'review', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'here', 'ironically', 'more', 'sex', 'series', 'Americans', 'are', 'used', 'less', 'actual', 'observed', 'violence', 'are', 'head', 'choppings', 'WERE', 'head', 'choppings', 'history', 'do', 'not', 'show', 'gruesome', 'images.Not', 'say', 'violence', 'camera', 'away', 'blood', 'gore.The', 'witchcraft', 'part', 'distracting', 'think', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'it.In', 'states', 'would', 'certainly', 'be', 'R', 'maybe', 'even', 'NC-17', 'sex', 'paradoxically', 'considering', 'era', 'was', 'set', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'PG-13', 'rated', 'only', 'violence']","The White Queen - Complete Series The White Queen: Series 1  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"

What I can say is the plot moved quickley and was interesting, I watched the entire series in one sitting!  It is also nice to have a show with a strong female lead.

What about that one great battle where 20,000 fought?  Has this director never heard of computer graphics?Also, the number of betrayals makes the Kings appear stupid.

Every six months without fail they have brought back another period, dazzlingly and painstakingly recreated.  Ok, not so much recreated as embellished upon.  If you loved, &#34;The Borgias, The Tudors, Spartacus (different time period) and Da Vinci's Demons&#34;, then you will most likely enjoy this set.They have taken many liberties historically, but that just makes it more interesting; at the very least for us.  It seems with all of these shows it is always about power and the struggle to keep or take.  The actors are perfectly suited for their character roles.  I have thoroughly enjoyed watching this DVD set at my leisure.  We usually order the Blu-ray versions but this DVD set will suffice.  It looked great on our HD televisions; just missing all of the extras.I would rather not go into any details regarding the series because it just spoils it for those planning to purchase the set.  If you enjoy historical drama or period pieces then this will be a sure win to add to your collection.  Keep in mind that it reads more like a historical 'novella' ripe with all the romance.

1635838,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00BMRTPEM,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","I don't get Starz, so I was very excited to watch this when it was released on DVD. I am a great fan of period dramas, and enjoy a well-scripted historical costume drama. &#34;The White Queen&#34; doesn't disappoint. This BBC period drama consists of ten parts and is based on Philippa Gregory's &#34;The Cousins' War&#34; trilogy which is made up of &#34;The White Queen&#34;, &#34;The Red Queen&#34;, and &#34;The Kingmaker's Daughter&#34;.  The historical time frame here is The War of the Roses, where various factions battle for the throne of England. At the beginning, the year is 1464, and there is a civil war raging between the House of York and the House of Lancaster. The central focus of this ten episode drama is the fates of three women, i.e. Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beaufort, and Anne Neville, although the primary focus here is on Elizabeth Woodville (wonderfully portrayed by the gorgeous Rebecca Ferguson).The show follows Elizabeth's progress from being the widowed Lady Jane Grey to her rise (and consequently her family's rise) in fortune when she captures the attention of the younger King Edward IV (Max Irons). Besotted by Elizabeth's alluring beauty, the King marries her in secret and against the express disapproval of his ally, the Kingmaker Lord Warwick (James Frain), he brings Elizabeth to court where her position as Queen is cemented by a grand coronation. Yet Elizabeth finds her list of enemies growing : her mother-in-law, Countess Cecilia; Warwick and his family; and those who are loyal to the House of Lancaster, including the fanatical Margaret of Beaufort.There is a lot of drama and political intrigue; violence and bloodshed; and of course, steamy sex scenes. There is plenty of nudity but in the context of the story, it doesn't seem misplaced or over-the-top (and these scenes are tame compared to the nudity and sex scenes in shows like Game of Thrones).  I enjoyed this show very much and although it appears that the BBC has no plans to make a follow-up season, I read that Starz might commission a follow-up series, which would be most welcome.",5,Steamy medieval period drama,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,2099,"['do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Starz', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'watch', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'am', 'great', 'fan', 'period', 'dramas', 'enjoy', 'well-scripted', 'historical', 'costume', 'drama', '34', 'White', 'Queen', '34', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'BBC', 'period', 'drama', 'ten', 'parts', 'based', 'Philippa', 'Gregory', '34', 'Cousins', 'War', '34', 'trilogy', 'made', '34', 'White', 'Queen', '34', '34', 'Red', 'Queen', '34', '34', 'Kingmaker', 'Daughter', '34', 'historical', 'time', 'frame', 'here', 'War', 'Roses', 'where', 'various', 'factions', 'battle', 'throne', 'England', 'beginning', 'year', '1464', 'civil', 'war', 'raging', 'House', 'York', 'House', 'Lancaster', 'central', 'focus', 'ten', 'episode', 'drama', 'fates', 'three', 'women', 'i.e', 'Elizabeth', 'Woodville', 'Margaret', 'Beaufort', 'Anne', 'Neville', 'primary', 'focus', 'here', 'Elizabeth', 'Woodville', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'gorgeous', 'Rebecca', 'Ferguson', '.The', 'show', 'Elizabeth', 'progress', 'being', 'widowed', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'Grey', 'rise', 'consequently', 'family', 'rise', 'fortune', 'when', 'attention', 'younger', 'King', 'Edward', 'IV', 'Max', 'Irons', 'Besotted', 'Elizabeth', 'alluring', 'beauty', 'King', 'marries', 'secret', 'express', 'disapproval', 'ally', 'Kingmaker', 'Lord', 'Warwick', 'James', 'Frain', 'Elizabeth', 'court', 'where', 'position', 'Queen', 'cemented', 'grand', 'coronation', 'Elizabeth', 'list', 'enemies', 'growing', 'mother-in-law', 'Countess', 'Cecilia', 'Warwick', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'loyal', 'House', 'Lancaster', 'including', 'fanatical', 'Margaret', 'Beaufort.There', 'lot', 'drama', 'political', 'intrigue', 'violence', 'bloodshed', 'course', 'steamy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'plenty', 'nudity', 'context', 'story', ""n't"", 'seem', 'misplaced', 'over-the-top', 'scenes', 'are', 'tame', 'compared', 'nudity', 'sex', 'scenes', 'shows', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'very', 'much', 'BBC', 'plans', 'make', 'follow-up', 'season', 'read', 'Starz', 'might', 'commission', 'follow-up', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'welcome']","The White Queen - Complete Series The White Queen: Series 1  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"
