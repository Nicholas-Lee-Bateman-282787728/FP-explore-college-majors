253700,AGEIT17HENDIS,6301449185,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Not all 1930s and 1940s black and white screwball romantic comedies were born equal, even when the same actor (here Cary Grant) starred in both vehicles being compared here. Recently I gave a big thumb&#8217;s up to Grant&#8217;s performance in 1940&#8217;s The Philadelphia Story (Katherine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart&#8217;s as well) where the wit and facial expressions exploded a so-so story line into a great film (little Miss Rich Girl gets her comeuppance and gets the gold ring too). The same cannot be said for the film under review, 1940&#8217;s My Favorite Wife, which stretches a small idea well beyond even Cary&#8217;s capacity for elegant slap-stick humor.Here Cary is inundated by the thinness of the story line. Cary, a lawyer with two children needing a mother, played by Irene Dunne, a mother who left on sea-borne photography assignment which got shipwrecked and left Cary believing for the required seven years that she was dead. As a result he filed papers in court to have her declared legally dead. The idea was so he could marry another. Funny thing though just as he gets that decree and actually gets remarried Irene shows up. Irene who was stranded on an island all that time (with a good-looking guy to boot). Naturally she uses her feminine wiles to try to sabotage the new marriage to get her man back. She does so by putting Cary through many hoops in the process. Too many to sustain the plot-line.

It never attempts to mimic the screwball comedy of that movie. They are both very good comedies and deserve to be judged on their own merits and not compared with the other film.Irene Dunne is great as Ellen Wagstaff; the supposedly dead wife of Cary Grant.  She had been shipwrecked while on an expedition seven years earlier.  The family dog greets her upon her return, but her two children think she is a stranger.  They believe their mother to be dead and she can't find the words to tell them that she is their mother.She discovers that her husband, Nick (Cary Grant) has just been married to Bianca (Gail Patrick), and they are on their honeymoon (at the same place he and Ellen went when the got married).  They are checking in when he first sees Ellen; after escorting his new bride to their room he returns to the front desk to get a room for Ellen.  Nick spends the remainder of the honeymoon going from room to room.  Donald McBride is very good as the hotel clerk who tries to accommodate his guests and at the same time show his moral indignation with the ""musical room"" situation of Grant's character and his wife(s).  This sets the tone for future scenes in which one of the spouses is trying to hide something from the other, and Grant's trying to keep Bianca in the dark even after an insurance agent shows up threatening to have him arrested for fraud.  (One of the movie's biggest flaws is that Patrick's character is never fully developed thus leaving out potentially funny scenes that may have allowed the movie to stand on its own merit and not compared to the earlier film).While he still loves Ellen he is unsure what to do or what to say or whom to say it to.  In a way he's afraid of his snooty, high-strung new bride. Ellen attempts to tease him about remarrying saying ""I can't turn my back on you for a second"", which makes Nick feel guilty.  His guilt turns to suspicions when he finds she has neglected to mention that she was on the island with a man.When he confronts her, she tries to pass off a short, balding shoe clerk (Chester Clute), as her island companion, Stephen.  She's unaware that he's already seen the tall, athletic Stephen (Randolph Scott), at the Pacific Club. When Ellen says she can live without either of them she finds herself going for an unexpected swim.  Nick's then shows his jealousy by delivering some of the movies funniest one-liners aimed at the dumb-as-dirt Stephen.Another performance worth mentioning is that of Granville Bates as the cantankerous and somewhat bemused judge trying who tries to sort the whole mess out.We always know that Grant and Dunne will wind up together at then end but it fun watching them get there.",5,Another Dunne and Grant Classic,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,2792,"['often', 'compared', 'Awful', 'Truth', 'also', 'starred', 'Grant', 'Dunne', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'never', 'mimic', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'comedies', 'deserve', 'be', 'judged', 'own', 'merits', 'not', 'compared', 'other', 'film.Irene', 'Dunne', 'great', 'Ellen', 'Wagstaff', 'supposedly', 'dead', 'wife', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'had', 'been', 'shipwrecked', 'expedition', 'seven', 'years', 'earlier', 'family', 'dog', 'return', 'two', 'children', 'think', 'stranger', 'believe', 'mother', 'be', 'dead', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'words', 'tell', 'mother.She', 'discovers', 'husband', 'Nick', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'just', 'been', 'married', 'Bianca', 'Gail', 'Patrick', 'are', 'honeymoon', 'same', 'place', 'Ellen', 'went', 'when', 'got', 'married', 'are', 'checking', 'when', 'first', 'Ellen', 'escorting', 'new', 'bride', 'room', 'front', 'desk', 'get', 'room', 'Ellen', 'Nick', 'remainder', 'honeymoon', 'going', 'room', 'room', 'Donald', 'McBride', 'very', 'good', 'hotel', 'clerk', 'who', 'accommodate', 'guests', 'same', 'time', 'show', 'moral', 'indignation', 'musical', 'room', 'situation', 'Grant', 'character', 'wife', 's', 'tone', 'future', 'scenes', 'one', 'spouses', 'trying', 'hide', 'something', 'other', 'Grant', 'trying', 'keep', 'Bianca', 'dark', 'even', 'insurance', 'agent', 'up', 'threatening', 'have', 'arrested', 'fraud', 'One', 'movie', 'biggest', 'flaws', 'Patrick', 'character', 'never', 'fully', 'developed', 'thus', 'leaving', 'out', 'potentially', 'funny', 'scenes', 'may', 'have', 'allowed', 'movie', 'stand', 'own', 'merit', 'not', 'compared', 'earlier', 'film', 'still', 'Ellen', 'unsure', 'what', 'do', 'what', 'say', 'whom', 'say', 'way', 'afraid', 'snooty', 'high-strung', 'new', 'bride', 'Ellen', 'tease', 'remarrying', 'saying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'turn', 'back', 'second', 'Nick', 'feel', 'guilty', 'guilt', 'suspicions', 'when', 'neglected', 'mention', 'was', 'island', 'man.When', 'pass', 'off', 'short', 'balding', 'shoe', 'clerk', 'Chester', 'Clute', 'island', 'companion', 'Stephen', 'unaware', 'already', 'seen', 'tall', 'athletic', 'Stephen', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'Pacific', 'Club', 'When', 'Ellen', 'can', 'live', 'going', 'unexpected', 'swim', 'Nick', 'then', 'jealousy', 'delivering', 'movies', 'funniest', 'one-liners', 'aimed', 'dumb-as-dirt', 'Stephen.Another', 'performance', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Granville', 'Bates', 'cantankerous', 'somewhat', 'bemused', 'judge', 'trying', 'who', 'sort', 'whole', 'mess', 'out.We', 'always', 'know', 'Grant', 'Dunne', 'will', 'wind', 'up', 'together', 'then', 'end', 'watching', 'get', 'there']",N/A

As soon as Judge Bryson (Granville Bates) makes his declaration, Dunne's attorney husband, Cary Grant takes a new wife (Gail Patrick). But once they leave for their honeymoon, the long-lost Irene resurfaces, having been marooned on an island with Randy Scott (therein lies a subplot). She follows close behind the newlyweds.Some delicious events unfold at the honeymooners' hotel. Cary is all jitters now that he knows Irene is alive. He has his bride in Suite C and Irene in Suite A, and keeps shuttling between the two, afraid to tell the second wife that their marriage must be annulled, yet not ready to fully recommit to a first long-dead marriage. Meanwhile, the hotel manager has fits, knowing that Cary is entertaining two women.The funniest moment occurs when Grant brings Dunne and their two kids to a mountain cabin so that he can go away for two months to ""think things over."" Apparently, such a long a separation isn't needed, for no sooner does Cary leave but he returns, stammering out a lame excuse that the road is closed and the car is out of fuel. ""Well, just phone for help,"" Irene suggests. ""I can't,"" he replies. ""The phone lines are down.""

Note that in the trailer, the scene where Nick (Cary Grant) is arrested for bigamy is included. So try to forget how this movie might have been made seventy years later, and appreciate it for the period piece it is.The story opens with Nick and Bianca (Gail Patrick) in court. It has been seven years since Nick's wife Ellen (Irene Dunne) was lost at sea and presumed dead. He wants the judge to declare her legally dead and then marry him to Bianca. Fine.Back at the homestead, Ellen has just showed up wearing the clothes loaned to her by the Portuguese fishermen who rescued her off the island. Her mother-in-law is delighted to see her, tells her about Nick marrying Bianca, and acknowledges that she does not like Bianca.Neither do we. She's demanding, spoiled and not even as pretty as Ellen, although she's pretty. Anyway, Ellen rushes off to the hotel where they're having their honeymoon, the same one where Nick and Ellen had had theirs eleven years earlier. So we have the comedy of the desk clerk being aware that he has two women, one in Suite A and one in Suite C. Once Nick talks to Ellen and realizes he's still very much in love with her, most of the rest of the movie is how to (a) tell the truth to and (b) get rid of Bianca.Things get a great deal more complicated when Nick finds out about Burkett (Randolph Scott), the man who was marooned on that island for seven years with Ellen. Much of the story is all about who has lied to whom about what, but if they didn't all tell a pack of lies, the story would be maybe half an hour long instead of an hour and a half.

It is true that the sophisticated screwball farce of ""The Awful Truth"" is an often hilarious moviegoing experience. But the amusing comedy approach of ""My Favorite Wife"" is very enjoyable as well. It is silly, in fact, to knock a great film like this simply because it is filled with chuckles and smiles from the viewer rather than guffaws.No studio made this type of marital comedy better than RKO. The editing of Robert Wise, photography of Rudolph Mate, and gowns by Howard Green help turn this script by Bella and Samuel Spewack into a fun time at the movies. Everything is all class in this one, right down to the embroidered linen opening credits.Irene Dunne is fabulous as the supposedly dead wife of Cary Grant. Shipwrecked while on an anthropological expedition seven years earlier, the family dog greets her with joy upon her return. But her two children believe her to be dead and she cannot bring herself to tell them the truth. Dunne is all hamburgers and root beer here, holding back a tear for all the moments she missed with her children.Grant, however, has moved on, having just remarried. When he gets a take on his first wife while he and new bride, Bianca (Gail Patrick), are on their honeymoon, his stunned reaction sets the tone for all the fun to follow. Nick (Grant) is confused as to what to do, to say the very least. He still loves Ellen (Dunne) but is a bit afraid of the snotty Bianca. His guilt when Ellen teases him that she can't turn her back on him for a second turns to suspicion when he discovers that Portugese freighter rescued not one, but two people from that deserted island!There are some fun moments as Ellen tries to pass off a short, balding shoe clerk as her island companion to a Nick who's already got a glimpse of the tall and athletic Steven (Randolph Scott) at the Pacific Club. Ellen gets an unexpected dip in the pool there after proclaiming she can live without either of them! Nick's jealousy reveals itself in some hilarious one-liners aimed at Steven.Donald MacBride has some funny moments as the hotel clerk watching Grant swap rooms like musical chairs. And Granville Bates is great as the judge trying to sort out this whole mess so that true love prevails. A warm and wonderful ending in the mountains with the children caps this one off very nicely.This truly underrated blend of sentiment and comedy starring Irene Dunne and Cary Grant has stood too long in the shadows and it is time for it to take center stage for the warm and funny comedy it is.

Meanwhile back at the Arden house, his missing--and very much alive--wife Ellen (Irene Dunne) has reached home after a long and tiring journey from the tropical island on which she was stranded for the best part of ten years.Following a tearful reunion at his hotel, Nick and Ellen resolve to pick up their marriage once again...but what about Bianca?  And what will be Nick's reaction to the handsome ""Adam"" (Randolph Scott), whom he discovers shared Ellen's tropical oasis?  MY FAVORITE WIFE is a fast-moving, snappy romantic comedy, perfectly suited to the breezy talents of Cary Grant and Irene Dunne.Following ""The Awful Truth"" in 1937, this was the second movie in which Dunne and Grant starred for renowned producer/writer/director Leo McCarey (""Penny Serenade"" would come in 1941).  Irene Dunne beautifully plays Ellen's emotional state, especially during her scenes with the two children (Scotty Beckett and Mary Lou Harrington).Gail Patrick (best-remembered for playing Carole Lombard's snotty sister in another screwball classic, ""My Man Godfrey""), is also very strong here in the underwritten role of Bianca; it's a shame that she doesn't really get a big payoff, though.Randolph Scott and Cary Grant used to share a house in Los Angeles, and were very good friends in real life; so it's great seeing them together here and playing out a well-plotted comic rivalry for Irene Dunne's character of Ellen.  The cast also includes Donald MacBride, Granville Bates, Pedro de Cordoba and Anne Shoemaker.Later re-made in 1963 as ""Move Over, Darling"" starring Doris Day, James Garner and Polly Bergen (which was originally to have starred Marilyn Monroe, Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse under the title of ""Something's Gotta Give"", until Monroe's accidental death during filming).",4,"""I came here with my wife... hum... my bride really.

He is doing this so he can marry again.  Well all goes well, until his first wife returns!  And right in time for the honeymoon too.  The movie would be strong except that about midway through Cary Grant's character gets alarmed when he learns his wife didn't spend seven years on an abandoned island all alone.

The twist is that it's Ellen Arden (played brilliantly by Irene Dunne) who returns to find that her children don't recognize her and that her husband, Nick (Cary Grant) has remarried to a shrewish bride named Bianca. This complication is enough to fuel the movie for about a half an hour, making the first third of My Favorite Wife one of the most sublimely silly and smoothly acted screwball comedies ever. Dunne and Grant's chemistry in My Favorite Wife (this was their third picture together) is delicious as they take turns acting out and reacting to each other's childish schemes.Take the scene where Ellen is first introduced to Bianca. Nick hasn't gotten up the nerve to tell his bride that his first wife's come back, so Ellen pretends to be an old family friend, ""from the south."" She coos out one musical barb after another while Nick squirms. Cary's scene-stealing reactions to her are perfect. The fearful look in his eyes as he stirs a martini too loudly upon hearing Bianca's version of their wedding night is one of my all-time favorite Cary Grant moments.Unfortunately for the coherency of film, the Enoch Emery bit didn't provide quite enough material for the entire movie, so some subplots were added. Nick learns that Ellen spent her seven years of exile with a man she called ""Adam,"" played by Uberhunk, Randolph Scott. At first, Ellen convinces a short guy who works at the shoe store to pretend to be Adam, but she is soon found out when the real Adam spots her at lunch with Nick. Then Nick's jealousy prevents the couple from reconciling and of course, Ellen's still got to find a way to explain to her children that she's their mother. Add to this mess, a stereotypical psychiatrist, a bumbling judge and Bianca's hysterical crying and you've got one very busy movie.The ending of My Favorite Wife, strongly mirrors the earlier Dunne and Grant hit, The Awful Truth. In some respects its an homage and in other ways, it's just a pale imitation of the earlier classic. Leo McCarey who had directed the Awful Truth was scheduled to make My Favorite Wife, but in one of those ""coulda-shoulda-woulda"" tragedies of Hollywood, McCarey was hospitalized from a car accident and unable to direct the movie. In places where the plot was clunky it would have been wonderful to have McCarey's off the cuff ad-lib style of directing to keep things breezing along.Still, despite its flaws, My Favorite Wife is one of my favorite Cary Grant movies. Dunne and Grant are always watchable and I find something new to love in their performances every time I watch this gem.",5,My Favorite Wife,1048464000,"03 24, 2003",2003,2881,"['Plot', 'Nick', 'marries', 'Bianca', 'short', 'time', 'later', 'Ellen', 'first', 'wife', 'up', 'having', 'been', 'stranded', 'desert', 'island', 'seven', 'years', 'Favorite', 'Wife', 'screwball', 'rendering', 'Enoch', 'Emery', 'tale', 'old', 'saw', 'man', 'thought', 'lost', 'sea', 'who', 'find', 'wife', 'remarried', 'twist', 'Ellen', 'Arden', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'who', 'find', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'husband', 'Nick', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'remarried', 'shrewish', 'bride', 'named', 'Bianca', 'complication', 'enough', 'fuel', 'movie', 'half', 'hour', 'making', 'first', 'third', 'My', 'Favorite', 'Wife', 'one', 'most', 'sublimely', 'silly', 'smoothly', 'acted', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'ever', 'Dunne', 'Grant', 'chemistry', 'My', 'Favorite', 'Wife', 'was', 'third', 'picture', 'together', 'delicious', 'take', 'turns', 'acting', 'out', 'reacting', 'other', 'childish', 'schemes.Take', 'scene', 'where', 'Ellen', 'first', 'introduced', 'Bianca', 'Nick', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'up', 'nerve', 'tell', 'bride', 'first', 'wife', 'come', 'back', 'Ellen', 'pretends', 'be', 'old', 'family', 'friend', 'south', 'coos', 'out', 'one', 'musical', 'barb', 'while', 'Nick', 'squirms', 'Cary', 'scene-stealing', 'reactions', 'are', 'perfect', 'fearful', 'look', 'eyes', 'martini', 'too', 'loudly', 'hearing', 'Bianca', 'version', 'wedding', 'night', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'moments.Unfortunately', 'coherency', 'film', 'Enoch', 'Emery', 'bit', 'did', ""n't"", 'provide', 'quite', 'enough', 'material', 'entire', 'movie', 'so', 'subplots', 'were', 'added', 'Nick', 'Ellen', 'spent', 'seven', 'years', 'exile', 'man', 'called', 'Adam', 'played', 'Uberhunk', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'first', 'Ellen', 'short', 'guy', 'who', 'shoe', 'store', 'pretend', 'be', 'Adam', 'soon', 'found', 'out', 'when', 'real', 'Adam', 'spots', 'lunch', 'Nick', 'Then', 'Nick', 'jealousy', 'couple', 'reconciling', 'course', 'Ellen', 'still', 'got', 'find', 'way', 'explain', 'children', 'mother', 'Add', 'mess', 'stereotypical', 'psychiatrist', 'bumbling', 'judge', 'Bianca', 'hysterical', 'crying', ""'ve"", 'got', 'one', 'very', 'busy', 'movie.The', 'ending', 'My', 'Favorite', 'Wife', 'strongly', 'earlier', 'Dunne', 'Grant', 'hit', 'Awful', 'Truth', 'respects', 'homage', 'other', 'ways', 'just', 'pale', 'imitation', 'earlier', 'classic', 'Leo', 'McCarey', 'who', 'had', 'directed', 'Awful', 'Truth', 'was', 'scheduled', 'make', 'My', 'Favorite', 'Wife', 'one', 'coulda-shoulda-woulda', 'tragedies', 'Hollywood', 'McCarey', 'was', 'hospitalized', 'car', 'accident', 'unable', 'direct', 'movie', 'places', 'where', 'plot', 'was', 'clunky', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'have', 'McCarey', 'off', 'cuff', 'ad-lib', 'style', 'directing', 'keep', 'things', 'breezing', 'along.Still', 'flaws', 'My', 'Favorite', 'Wife', 'one', 'favorite', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'movies', 'Dunne', 'Grant', 'are', 'always', 'watchable', 'find', 'something', 'new', 'love', 'performances', 'time', 'watch', 'gem']",N/A

Mr. Alden (Cary Grant) and Mrs. Ellen Arden (Irene Dunne) were married 4 years with 2 toddlers before Ellen was missing for 7 years after a shipwreck. When she came back she found a blend new (less than 24 hours) Mrs. Bianca Arden on a honeymoon.What followed was Mr. Arden's unsuccessful attempt to dissuade Bianca, then his jealousy towards Mr. Burkett (Randolph Scott) for his company with his wife on an island during her years of missing. The dialogue can be funny and Randolph Scott lent his personal charm and physique to make a truly convincing rival. He swinged the rings and dived in the swimming pool like Tarzan. He also looked very bit like a relaxing millionnaire (in real life he was, with his screen success in the 50s). A very young Cary Grant coyly smiled his way out of embarrasing situations, one after another, and won over his favorite wife's heart clumsily but lovingly.This movie was a great way to revisit the old-fashioned charm.

253718,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6301449185,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[31, 36]","Some may be surprised at my reviewing a film like this, as the movies I usually review tend to fall into the science fiction and horror genres, but I do enjoy all kinds of films, especially romantic comedies from Hollywood's golden age.  There's something about films from 30's and 40's that I don't often see in movies today, and I would define it as class.  Characters in these old films often exuded a suave, sophisticated demeanor you rarely see in contemporary releases...maybe it had something to do with the now defunct studio system in those days, one that always tried to promote it's contract actors in the best possible light, cultivating and protecting them like the valuable commodities they were, elevating their status to a level usually reserved for royalty.  Nowadays, every wart, blemish, and pimple, metaphorically speaking, is exposed (remember not so long ago when Hugh Grant got caught in that tryst with that rather seedy street walker?  Fifty years ago the general public would have never heard about it), revealing the stars of today are a lot like us, except for the fame and fortune...but I digress...My Favorite Wife (1940), directed by Garson Kanin (They Knew What They Wanted), reunites the stars of the earlier film, The Awful Truth (1937), Cary Grant (Arsenic and Old Lace, Notorious), and Irene Dunne (Show Boat).  Also appearing is Randolph Scott (Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm), Gail Patrick (My Man Godfrey), and character actors Donald MacBride (The Thin Man Goes Home) and Granville Bates (Of Mice and Men).The film opens with Nick Arden (Grant) appearing in court, attempting to have his wife, Ellen (Dunne) who's been missing for the past seven years, declared legally dead, so that he may remarry.  Seems Ellen signed on an expedition as a photographer, and the ship she was traveling on was lost at sea.  Well, the very day Nick convinces the court to declare her dead and marries his new wife (Patrick), a very alive Ellen reappears determined to regain her old life back (she was stranded on a island, but was able to flag down an errant ship) and Nick now must face the fact that he's an unintentional bigamist.  It's obvious Nick's still in love with Ellen, but just can't seem to muster the nerve to tell his new bride that his old wife has come back.  And then there's also a bit of an obstacle in that of the very handsome Stephen Burkett (Scott), also a member of the ill-fated expedition, and the man Ellen shared her island with the past seven years, and, as you may have already guessed, has the hots for Ellen...oh dear, what a mess...Let's face it, you really can't go wrong with a Cary Grant comedy, and My Favorite Wife is no exception.  The main brunt of the comedy comes from Grant's character's unease at breaking the news to his bride (she seems the high maintenance type, the kind men would normally acquiesce to rather than deal with the inevitable confrontation) about the return of his once thought deceased wife, with whom he's still deeply in love with...Grant plays the role of the seemingly normal man, who knows what he wants, but just not how to go about getting it, thrust into a downward spiral of confusion and comedic perplexity trying to adjust to an outlandishly complex situation that only gets worse as he attempts to pull himself out.  The very attractive Dunne also plays her role very well as the genial, confident woman determined to pick up where she left off, believing in her heart the complexities of the situation will resolve themselves in her favor, but feeling the growing uncertainty that her husband will find the resolve to do what she knows he feels in his heart to be right.  The scene where she finally brings herself to reveal her identity to her young children (she was gone for seven years, so they were too young to remember her) is very sweet, but deftly avoids the schmaltz one would see in a lesser film.  These two, talented actors really work well together, giving the impression of a perfect pairing whether on or off the screen, and showing a level of familiarity that obviously comes from prior, on screen couplings.  Other performances worth mentioning are that of Donald MacBride as the somewhat accommodating but soon morally flustered hotel clerk (Ellen shows up just prior to Nick and his new bride checking in for their honeymoon), and curmudgeonly Granville Bates as the flummoxed judge trying to sort the whole mess out.  I guess the only problem I have with the film, an issued shared by at least a few other people, is it just feels a bit light.  The actors flesh their characters out as much as the screenplay allows, and do it well, but the underlying material seemed a bit skimpy.  A perfect example is Randolph Scott's character...he seemed more of just a hollow plot device rather than an integral part of the story, and his impact is felt so little that when not on screen, he's pretty much forgotten.  I can't help but wonder how audiences received the material within the film, specifically the whole `bigamy' angle, if there was some level of concern from a moral standpoint.  I thought the story handled it in an unlikely manner, but certainly possible one.The black and white, full screen, original aspect ratio picture (1.37:1) looks really sharp, despite a few, very minor flaws.  The audio is also very clear, and comes through well.  Provided are some interesting special features including a Screen Director's Playhouse radio production featuring Grant and Dunne, a theatrical trailer for the film, and an entertaining comic short titled Home Movies featuring popular (at the time, at least) journalist/humorist/comedian Robert Benchley.  All in all, I wouldn't necessarily consider this to be one of Grant's best films, but it's still pretty darn good and definitely worth seeing.Cookieman108",4,"""I bet you say that to all your

Naturally, she shows up the very same day, only to find her beloved hubby remarried and the kids all grown up, with no idea she's their mom.  But, for some reason, neither Grant nor Dunne can muster the courage to tell anyone right away what has gone wrong (it'd be an awful short film if they did...) and though that aspect of the movie is completely implausible, the film itself is predictably fun.  Several interesting aspects to the production... first off, Cary Grant is at his absolute most drop-dead gorgeous; just looking at him light up the screen makes up for any deficiencies in the script.  Dunne, who I usually find unappealling, also looks pretty good here, as does Randolph Scott (who plays Grant's romantic rival)... I suspect the cinematographer is largely to thank; the lighting on this film was very skillful, and brought out the best in all these stars.  Also check out the elaborate set design on the scenes that replicate the famous Awahnee Hotel, in Yosemite Valley... You can tell it's not quite the real deal... but -- man! -- is the set design impressive!

As luck would have it, Ellen returns the very day he remarries and tracks him down at his honeymoon hotel. The second he sees Ellen, Nick realizes he still loves her but he has to first break the news to Bianca, his new wife, as well as tell his children that their mother is still alive. Hilarious complications ensue as Nick tries to find just the right time to tell Bianca and when he discovers that Ellen was marooned on the island with the hunky, athletic Stephen Burkett.This is a very funny movie. As with all screwball comedies, you have to take everything with a grain of salt (what are the odds that Ellen would return the very day Nick remarries?) and not think too much about it (just what happened between Ellen and Burkett on that island?) but the laughs are worth it. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, especially when Ellen convinces a shoe salesman to pose as Burkett. The movie skips over the issue of bigamy by hinting that Nick's second marriage wasn't consummated and while Burkett seems to be in love with Ellen, she only has eyes for Nick. Or course, it would have been easy for Nick to simply tell Bianca that Ellen was his wife, but that would have taken away from the fun of the movie.The actors are excellent. Cary Grant was a great actor and could make you laugh without saying a word - the scene in which he first spots Ellen is a perfect example. Irene Dunn is a delight as Ellen; Gail Patrick is a cool if puzzled Bianca; Randolph Scott is a hunky Burkett.

This is the second and most lightweight of three very fruitful screen pairings they had during this period - the other two are the even more insane divorce farce, ""The Awful Truth"", from 1937 and 1941's child adoption tearjerker, ""Penny Serenade"". With her insinuating laugh and sophisticated but down-to-earth manner, she is a wonderful screwball heroine, even if she lacks the haughty glamour of Katharine Hepburn or the brazen beauty of Carole Lombard.Here Dunne plays Ellen Wagstaff Arden returning home after seven years shipwrecked on a desert island. The problem is that her husband Nick has just gotten remarried to a high maintenance socialite named Bianca. Misunderstandings seem to multiply when it's disclosed that Ellen was not alone on the island and that her companion was an athletic Adonis named Stephen Burkett, of course a bachelor. The ending is obvious from the beginning, but there are some hilarious set pieces along the way, in particular, when Ellen recruits a timid shoe salesman to impersonate Stephen and also when her ruse is exposed as the real Stephen pops up from the country club swimming pool. In 1940, the same year he made classics like ""The Philadelphia Story"" and ""His Girl Friday"", Grant is at the top of his game, and Dunne matches him every step of the way. It does seem a bit of a stretch to think that the principal characters would be celibate for seven long years, but such was 1930's Hollywood convention.Randolph Scott gamely plays the dumb-as-dirt Stephen, an ironic choice given the rumors of the actor's relationship with Grant. As Bianca, the glamorously venomous Gail Patrick - expert at such roles from classics like ""My Man Godfrey"" and ""Stage Door"" - knows her fate in the movie but doesn't really show her talons until the courtroom scene. In scene-stealing bits are Granville Bates as the frustrated judge and Donald MacBride as the confused hotel clerk. The only drawbacks are the overly precocious children played hammily by Scotty Beckett and Mary Lou Harrington. Breezily directed by Garson Kanin, it's a frothy confection from a bygone era, and the far inferior 1963 Doris Day remake only proves how unmatchable Grant and Dunne are. The DVD has a surprisingly pristine print transfer, and extras include an unrelated comic short featuring humorist Robert Benchley and a condensed 1950 broadcast of the movie featuring Grant and Dunne.",4,Let Us Now Praise Irene Dunne,1141776000,"03 8, 2006",2006,2616,"['Cary', 'Grant', 'justifiably', 'remembered', 'screen', 'legend', 'indeed', 'probably', 'most', 'adept', 'contemporaries', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'criminal', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'days', 'second', 'most', 'lightweight', 'three', 'very', 'fruitful', 'screen', 'pairings', 'had', 'period', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'insane', 'divorce', 'farce', 'Awful', 'Truth', '1937', '1941', 'child', 'adoption', 'tearjerker', 'Penny', 'Serenade', 'insinuating', 'laugh', 'sophisticated', 'down-to-earth', 'manner', 'wonderful', 'screwball', 'heroine', 'even', 'haughty', 'glamour', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'brazen', 'beauty', 'Carole', 'Lombard.Here', 'Dunne', 'Ellen', 'Wagstaff', 'Arden', 'returning', 'home', 'seven', 'years', 'shipwrecked', 'desert', 'island', 'problem', 'husband', 'Nick', 'just', 'gotten', 'remarried', 'high', 'maintenance', 'socialite', 'named', 'Bianca', 'Misunderstandings', 'seem', 'multiply', 'when', 'disclosed', 'Ellen', 'was', 'not', 'alone', 'island', 'companion', 'was', 'athletic', 'Adonis', 'named', 'Stephen', 'Burkett', 'course', 'bachelor', 'ending', 'obvious', 'beginning', 'are', 'hilarious', 'set', 'pieces', 'way', 'particular', 'when', 'Ellen', 'timid', 'shoe', 'salesman', 'impersonate', 'Stephen', 'also', 'when', 'ruse', 'exposed', 'real', 'Stephen', 'up', 'country', 'club', 'swimming', 'pool', '1940', 'same', 'year', 'made', 'classics', 'Philadelphia', 'Story', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'Grant', 'top', 'game', 'Dunne', 'matches', 'step', 'way', 'seem', 'bit', 'stretch', 'think', 'principal', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'celibate', 'seven', 'long', 'years', 'such', 'was', '1930', 'Hollywood', 'convention.Randolph', 'Scott', 'gamely', 'dumb-as-dirt', 'Stephen', 'ironic', 'choice', 'given', 'rumors', 'actor', 'relationship', 'Grant', 'Bianca', 'glamorously', 'venomous', 'Gail', 'Patrick', 'expert', 'such', 'roles', 'classics', 'Man', 'Godfrey', 'Stage', 'Door', 'fate', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'show', 'talons', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'scene-stealing', 'bits', 'are', 'Granville', 'Bates', 'frustrated', 'judge', 'Donald', 'MacBride', 'confused', 'hotel', 'clerk', 'only', 'drawbacks', 'are', 'overly', 'precocious', 'children', 'played', 'hammily', 'Scotty', 'Beckett', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'Harrington', 'Breezily', 'directed', 'Garson', 'Kanin', 'frothy', 'confection', 'bygone', 'era', 'far', 'inferior', '1963', 'Doris', 'Day', 'remake', 'only', 'how', 'unmatchable', 'Grant', 'Dunne', 'are', 'DVD', 'surprisingly', 'pristine', 'print', 'transfer', 'extras', 'include', 'unrelated', 'comic', 'short', 'featuring', 'humorist', 'Robert', 'Benchley', 'condensed', '1950', 'broadcast', 'movie', 'featuring', 'Grant', 'Dunne']",N/A

Surely he's putting himself through more anguish by delaying the inevitable, and his various excuses never make sense.  In the end, I felt sorry for Bianca, and frustrated by the &quot;sympathetic&quot; leads.  Ellen's mother-in-law tells her at the beginning that Bianca is not a nice person, but it seems to me that she reacts in a perfectly understandable way and that everyone treats her very badly.

Finding him at the honeymoon hotel wasn't difficult since it was the same one in which he consummated his first marriage. Ellen's goal is to keep Nick from consummating a second.Nick's strong feelings for his first wife are apparent. Once he spots her, she is never far away. In fact, it is not clear why he married Gail. Ellen concludes it was for the benefit of the children and Nick sheepishly agrees in order to have some excuse, though the new bride is never seen interacting with the kiddies. Nevertheless, it takes Nick considerable time to get up enough nerve to tell Gail the honeymoon is over. His cryptic rendezvous and resistance to her affection makes Gail feel something is wrong with one of them -- physically or mentally.Prolonging Nick's procrastination is his discovery of where Ellen has been for seven years. The delay in explaining the facts to his bride makes Ellen wonder if he prefers Gail. To speed things along, Ellen uses every feminine wile to lure her love back in her arms.During this emotional merry-go-round, Nick must juggle an insurance man, a psychoanalyst, two wives, and the law who would arrest him for bigamy.

It centers around a married couple in which the wife was believed lost at sea and presumed dead. It turned out that she was marooned for seven years  on a desert island with another man until finally rescued inadvertently. She arrives home on the morning in which her lawyer husband has had her declared dead and remarried another woman. Let the games begin!Irene Dunne and Gary Grant are the star crossed couple who find each other again. Cary Grant is excellent, while Ms. Dunne, who is usually sensational, palls a bit in her role, in part due to her difficulty in deciding what accent she should use when reciting her lines. She is still quite good in her role, however, due to her innate ability to charm the viewer. Gail Patrick is excellent as the second wife, giving an icy hauteur to her character. Randolph Scott is terrific as the hunky man with whom Irene Dunne was marooned. Ann Shoemaker is very good as the mother-in-law who warmly welcomes Irene Dunne back into the fold. Look for two absolutely marvelous performance by old time character actors, Donald MacBride, as the confused and outraged hotel manager, and Granville Bates, as the drolly funny judge. They practically steal the show.The movie has its moments and can be quite funny, at times. The funniest moment is the pool scene in which Cary Grant views his rival for the first time. His reaction to his rival's attractiveness and athleticism at the pool is quite priceless. At other times, the scenes seem a bit forced.

I'm constantly poking fun at and mocking people who are unable to watch a production in the context of its creation - the 1930s never were, and will never be, the 2000s.It's ridiculous to view such films thru a narrow modern prism.Women were generally weaker or emotionally unstable, people of color were servants or entertaining buffoons, Scots were cheapskates, Irish were brutal fall-down drunkards, Chinese were either effusive bobbing fools or sinister manipulators, etc, etc. It's not right, but that's the way it was back then. Cool critical thinking is required. I've even observed someone get angry and spitting at 'Roots' while completely ignoring the powerful historical drama being offered. Seen it before at different film festivals as well, especially the derision coming from women when female subservience is displayed on screen.However, in this film, I'm trapped in my own biased perspective.I just can't buy that a stunningly beautiful woman and a very handsome man can remain completely platonic while stranded alone on a deserted island for 7 years. Just not believable and too preposterous to accept. So the foundation of this film is, for me, completely unworkable. That's not to say that it's not entertaining. It's just that I have to 'forgive and forget' in order to move on and appreciate.A hilarious movie with Grant at the peak of his physical comedy. And I never tire of Irene Dunne, never. She's just so beautiful. Radiant and stylish, with just the right amount of playful sexual energy. One of my favorite performers from this period. That she's a talented actress only adds to that wonderful mix.In this film Grant plays Nick Arden, a successful lawyer, father of two, and soon-to-be former widower. Having lost his wife seven years previous, he's now legally free to marry again. And with two young children to raise, he feels has to find a stepmother for their sake. Pretty standard fare, except for one thing. His first wife, and true love, isn't dead.Stepping off a truck dressed as a Portugese fisherman is Ellen Arden. She's been rescued from the desert island she's called home for all those years. The very day she returns home is the very day Nick has married a haughty bitch played by Gail Patrick. Throw in the amazing Randolf Scott, who looks like the living embodiment of the Greek god Apollo and his own unrequited (and unbelievably - unconsummated) love for Ellen.Well, you get the picture. Awkward social interplay and hilarious hijinks abound. Especially as Ellen employs trickery and out-n-out fraud to deter Nick from believing what every guy is going to believe. How these four work out their predicament makes for an incredibly enjoyable and funny film.Personal Note: Classic movie fans already know this, but back then, when Hollywood found a winning formula - they usually milked it to death. Hmm. Come to think of it, that's not so different from today. &lt;g> Combo teams that captured that special on-screen chemistry were often paired together for years and years. Myrna Loy and William Powell immediately jumps to mind. And speaking of Myrna, she's the point I want to make about Irene.Dunne and Grant were another winning duo. They did so many fantastic films together, like this one. And their pairing was guaranteed box office success. So I've been haunted for many years when they weren't able to work together on one of my all-time favorite films: ""Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House"".Director H.C. Potter wanted Irene for the production, but unfortunately she had already committed to a different picture and his production couldn't wait. So they hired Myrna as her replacement. I think she did a fine job and I still enjoy the movie very much. But I often wonder how much more wonderful 'Dream House' would've have been had Irene taken the role of Murial Blandings. God, what a missed opportunity!Don't blame Irene at all - the role she took eventually earned her a Best Actress Oscar win. But still. &lt;sigh>Interestingly, a few years later, both Grant and Dunne signed on to do a radio version of ""Dream House"". And I have to say - it's utterly *fantastic*. It makes contemplating 'what could have been' all the more painful.",4,"Hilarious, If Somewhat Ludicrous Premise",1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,4355,"['Have', 'very', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'film', 'one', 'few', 'instances', 'where', ""'m"", 'unable', 'extract', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'impartially', 'review', 'movie', ""'m"", 'constantly', 'poking', 'fun', 'mocking', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'unable', 'watch', 'production', 'context', 'creation', '1930s', 'never', 'were', 'will', 'never', 'be', '2000s.It', 'ridiculous', 'view', 'such', 'films', 'thru', 'narrow', 'modern', 'prism.Women', 'were', 'generally', 'weaker', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'people', 'color', 'were', 'servants', 'entertaining', 'buffoons', 'Scots', 'were', 'cheapskates', 'Irish', 'were', 'brutal', 'fall-down', 'drunkards', 'Chinese', 'were', 'either', 'effusive', 'bobbing', 'fools', 'sinister', 'manipulators', 'etc', 'etc', 'not', 'right', 'way', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'Cool', 'critical', 'thinking', 'required', ""'ve"", 'even', 'observed', 'someone', 'get', 'angry', 'spitting', ""'Roots"", 'completely', 'ignoring', 'powerful', 'historical', 'drama', 'being', 'offered', 'Seen', 'before', 'different', 'film', 'festivals', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'derision', 'coming', 'women', 'when', 'female', 'subservience', 'displayed', 'screen.However', 'film', ""'m"", 'trapped', 'own', 'biased', 'perspective.I', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'very', 'handsome', 'man', 'can', 'remain', 'completely', 'platonic', 'stranded', 'alone', 'deserted', 'island', '7', 'years', 'Just', 'not', 'believable', 'too', 'preposterous', 'accept', 'foundation', 'film', 'completely', 'unworkable', 'not', 'say', 'not', 'entertaining', 'just', 'have', ""'forgive"", 'forget', 'order', 'move', 'appreciate.A', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'Grant', 'peak', 'physical', 'comedy', 'never', 'tire', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'never', 'just', 'so', 'beautiful', 'Radiant', 'stylish', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'playful', 'sexual', 'energy', 'One', 'favorite', 'performers', 'period', 'talented', 'actress', 'only', 'wonderful', 'mix.In', 'film', 'Grant', 'Nick', 'Arden', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'father', 'two', 'soon-to-be', 'former', 'widower', 'Having', 'lost', 'wife', 'seven', 'years', 'previous', 'now', 'legally', 'free', 'marry', 'again', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'raise', 'find', 'stepmother', 'sake', 'Pretty', 'standard', 'fare', 'one', 'thing', 'first', 'wife', 'true', 'love', ""n't"", 'dead.Stepping', 'off', 'truck', 'dressed', 'Portugese', 'fisherman', 'Ellen', 'Arden', 'been', 'rescued', 'desert', 'island', 'called', 'home', 'years', 'very', 'day', 'home', 'very', 'day', 'Nick', 'married', 'haughty', 'bitch', 'played', 'Gail', 'Patrick', 'Throw', 'amazing', 'Randolf', 'Scott', 'who', 'living', 'embodiment', 'Greek', 'god', 'Apollo', 'own', 'unrequited', 'unbelievably', 'unconsummated', 'love', 'Ellen.Well', 'get', 'picture', 'Awkward', 'social', 'interplay', 'hilarious', 'hijinks', 'abound', 'Especially', 'Ellen', 'trickery', 'out-n-out', 'fraud', 'deter', 'Nick', 'believing', 'what', 'guy', 'going', 'believe', 'How', 'four', 'work', 'out', 'predicament', 'incredibly', 'enjoyable', 'funny', 'film.Personal', 'Note', 'Classic', 'movie', 'fans', 'already', 'know', 'back', 'then', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'found', 'winning', 'formula', 'usually', 'milked', 'death', 'Hmm', 'Come', 'think', 'not', 'so', 'different', 'today', 'lt', '>', 'Combo', 'teams', 'captured', 'special', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'were', 'often', 'paired', 'together', 'years', 'years', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'William', 'Powell', 'immediately', 'mind', 'speaking', 'Myrna', 'point', 'want', 'make', 'Irene.Dunne', 'Grant', 'were', 'winning', 'duo', 'did', 'so', 'many', 'fantastic', 'films', 'together', 'one', 'pairing', 'was', 'guaranteed', 'box', 'office', 'success', ""'ve"", 'been', 'haunted', 'many', 'years', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'work', 'together', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'films', 'Mr.', 'Blandings', 'Builds', 'Dream', 'House', '.Director', 'H.C.', 'Potter', 'wanted', 'Irene', 'production', 'unfortunately', 'had', 'already', 'committed', 'different', 'picture', 'production', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'hired', 'Myrna', 'replacement', 'think', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'still', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'often', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'wonderful', ""'Dream"", 'House', 'would', ""'ve"", 'have', 'been', 'had', 'Irene', 'taken', 'role', 'Murial', 'Blandings', 'God', 'what', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'Do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Irene', 'role', 'took', 'eventually', 'earned', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'win', 'still', 'lt', 'sigh', '>', 'Interestingly', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Grant', 'Dunne', 'signed', 'do', 'radio', 'version', 'Dream', 'House', 'have', 'say', 'utterly', '*fantastic*', 'contemplating', ""'what"", 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'painful']",N/A

I found it to be consistently amusing, although it is not in the same class as &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; or &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;.After seven years of grieving over the apparent loss of his wife in a shipwreck, Nick ( Cary Grant ) marries another woman, Bianca, ( Gail Patrick ), only to discover on his honeymoon that wife # 1--Ellen ( Irene Dunne ) is back, very much alive and kicking. Naturally, Ellen wants to pick up where she left off with her husband, as well as a young son and daughter. Nick is &quot;dazed and confused&quot;--as only Cary Grant can be--and makes the situation much worse through his reluctance to break the news to Bianca. At the same time, Nick discovers that his &quot;first wife&quot; spent the better part of the seven years on an island, alone with another man--a hunky, athletic guy named Burkett ( Randolph Scott ). How will this hilarious mess turn out ? Get the disc and see.We have another superb comedic perfomance from Cary Grant. Irene Dunne is fine as Ellen, &quot;returned from the dead&quot; and determined, by any means, to win her husband back. Gail Patrick's performance is a nice contrast to her sudden &quot;competition&quot;--icy, haughty and seriously &quot;not amused&quot; !Randolph Scott--usually quite stoic in his many westerns--seems to be having a ball here. In support, special kudos to scene-stealing Donald MacBride as the hotel clerk, who has to book separate suites for each of Cary's &quot;women&quot;--his incredulous face is priceless.The DVD is black and white, and shows a fair bit of wear in places--not enough to spoil your fun though. Keep in mind, the film was made in 1940. The disc also includes a trailer for the film, a radio program with Ms. Dunne, and a funny short film starring humourist Robert Benchley on the perils of showing &quot;Home Movies&quot; to your &quot;lucky&quot; friends !

253751,A16QODENBJVUI1,6301449185,Robert Moore,"[9, 11]","MY FAVORITE WIFE is not among the very best comedies of pre-war Hollywood, but it is nonetheless quite excellent, driven by a strong script, superb lead performers, and a number of great character performances.  Cary Grant is the finest comic actor film has produced and this film demonstrates that as well as any.  Though he was equally as good in classics such as BRINGING UP BABY and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, those films were so marvelously directed, so superbly well written, and filled with such an overabundance of great actors that one might not notice just how outstanding Grant was (that is not the case with HIS GIRL FRIDAY, where even among an embarrassment of riches, Grant stands out and dominates the film).  Here Grant is surrounded by fewer talented actors, is working with a slightly less superb (though still quite good) script, and is directed by the writer instead of the director originally scheduled for the project.  Originally the plan was to reunite Grant, Irene Dunne, and Leo McCarey, the big threesome of the classic 1937 screwball THE AWFUL TRUTH.  Unfortunately, McCarey had a car wreck just before shooting was begun and was unable to be on the set.  Canin did a good if not spectacular job.  Unlike his fellow writers Billy Wilder and Preston Sturges, both of whom became fulltime directors of their own scripts around this time, Canin primarily remained a writer for the rest of his career.Still, the film was more successful than it should have been, mainly because of Cary Grant, though Irene Dunne was certainly a strong presence as his costar.  But in rewatching the film, it becomes obvious that almost all of the great comic moments are Grant's.  What is remarkable is that he essentially plays a coward.  The plot is simple.  A man goes before a judge to get his wife declared dead after she has been missing for several years, apparently drowned in the Indian Ocean, so that he will be free to remarry.  The judge grants the request and then marries them, but of course the next scene shows the wife who has been declared dead arriving at her home, just after being rescued (why she wouldn't have called first isn't explained).  Learning that her husband has remarried and is about to go on his honeymoon, she follows after.  Much of the humor of the film revolves around cowardice, Grant's inability to tell his new wife that his old wife has miraculously returned from the dead, and Dunne's reticence to tell him that she had been stranded on the island with beefcake Randolph Scott.  That really is about all the plot there is.  They manage to get a lot of mileage out of Grant's inability to come out and say what he wants.  He is the epitome of the incommunicative male.  The film is also enlivened by a number of superb supporting actors.  Virtually none of the great comedies off the studio era in Hollywood failed to feature a group of first rate character actors.  Here the two that most stand out are Granville Bates as the Judge in a magnificently performed role and Donald MacBride as the exasperated, confused, and highly suspicious hotel clerk.The film is interesting for the pairing of Cary Grant and Randolph Scott, about whom rumors have circulated for decades.  I've never seen any good evidence that either was gay or bisexual or involved with one another, but the rumors have persisted nonetheless.  The primary ""evidence"" seems to have been that while they were roommates during the 1930s they were unusually good housekeepers, keeping their apartment meticulous.  Why neatness should be evidence of homosexuality I am not sure, but we know for a fact that both Grant and Scott dated women extensively through the thirties, but there is no evidence whatsoever of any physical relationship between the two.  Sadly, the rumors of their having had a relationship apparently took a toll on their friendship.  This film was made well after the rumors had begun but after they had ceased rooming together and well before their friendship largely ended.All in all, this is one of the more enjoyable comic films of the age.  It isn't a classic in the mold of HIS GIRL FRIDAY or BRINGING UP BABY or THE LADY EVE, but it is nonetheless an exceptionally easy to like and enjoy film featuring great performers at their peak.Note:  If one scans the reviews below one will note several mentions of colorized versions.

Ellen has been declared legally dead since she has been missing and presumed drowned after seven years of absence. Nick has found another woman named Bianca (Gail Patrick), a stuffy and spoiled woman, and married her. On his honeymoon, he discovers at Ellen is still alive and has returned from a deserted island to re-claim her family. Hilarity ensues when Nick is reluctant to tell his new bride the news and she does all she can to figure out his odd behavior.This movie is a very light comedy. The plot is interesting enough in itself and is executed relatively well. It seems to get funnier as time goes on. Of course, it is rather strange to hear Dunne spoken of as a great beauty and a perfect woman. She might have been a good housewife, but she isn't the most beautiful of all the classic starlets.Unfortunately, the re-make of this film starring Marilyn Monroe and Dean Martin was never completed. Something's Got To Give is the last film Monroe was working on before her death. What exists shows a competant comedic team making a laugh a minute and a loyal tribute to the original. I believe it could have been better than My Favorite Wife. We do not have the remake, though, so we are left with a sufficiently funny romp with two wonderful stars.",4,Wish We Had the Re-Make,1164412800,"11 25, 2006",2006,1453,"['Favorite', 'Wife', 'funny', 'story', 'featuring', 'beloved', 'screen', 'team', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'star', 'Nick', 'Ellen', 'Arden', 'married', 'couple', 'comedy', 'complication', 'Ellen', 'been', 'declared', 'legally', 'dead', 'been', 'missing', 'presumed', 'drowned', 'seven', 'years', 'absence', 'Nick', 'found', 'woman', 'named', 'Bianca', 'Gail', 'Patrick', 'stuffy', 'spoiled', 'woman', 'married', 'honeymoon', 'Ellen', 'still', 'alive', 'returned', 'deserted', 'island', 're-claim', 'family', 'Hilarity', 'when', 'Nick', 'reluctant', 'tell', 'new', 'news', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'odd', 'behavior.This', 'movie', 'very', 'light', 'comedy', 'plot', 'interesting', 'enough', 'executed', 'relatively', 'well', 'get', 'funnier', 'time', 'course', 'rather', 'strange', 'hear', 'Dunne', 'spoken', 'great', 'beauty', 'perfect', 'woman', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'housewife', ""n't"", 'most', 'beautiful', 'classic', 'starlets.Unfortunately', 're-make', 'film', 'starring', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'was', 'never', 'completed', 'Something', 'Got', 'Give', 'last', 'film', 'Monroe', 'was', 'working', 'death', 'What', 'competant', 'comedic', 'team', 'making', 'laugh', 'minute', 'loyal', 'tribute', 'original', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Favorite', 'Wife', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'remake', 'though', 'are', 'left', 'sufficiently', 'funny', 'romp', 'two', 'wonderful', 'stars']",N/A

Ellen Arden (Irene Dunne), lost on a desert island for seven years, turns up just after she has been declared legally dead and after her husband, Nick (Cary Grant), has married icey Bianca (Gail Patrick).  Although her Ellen's children don't recognise her, the dog does (!).  In order to see her husband, Ellen arrives at the new couple's honeymoon hotel where Nick spots her....Tennyson's plot for ENOCH ARDEN, which is the source for this film, was one of the most durable in Hollywood.  This type of comedy was, of course, Cary Grant's forte, and he plays it to perfection. For instance, when he first sees Ellen, he's in an elevator.  The doors are closing: leaving his feet in place, he leans sideways until he is touching the opposite wall, his body completely on the bias. Because it is enacted by Grant, the scene looks like the most natural behaviour in the world, and he carries it off beautifully.  Overall, Irene Dunne (she was 41 here) is lighthearted and cute: she convinces the audience that if Nick were to lose her, it would be a great mistake.  Donald McBride is a kick as the suspicious hotel clerk, contorting his face into a bulldog pout and popping his eyes in amazement when Grant checks in with another wife. This colourised version is advantageous because the print is sharp and clear.",4,HILARIOUS CHARMER FROM 1940.,1035936000,"10 30, 2002",2002,1438,"[""n't"", 'quite', 'par', '1937', 'comedy', 'smash', 'hit', 'AWFUL', 'TRUTH', 'Grant', 'Dunne', 'shine', 'cheery', 'film', 'Ellen', 'Arden', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'lost', 'desert', 'island', 'seven', 'years', 'up', 'just', 'been', 'declared', 'legally', 'dead', 'husband', 'Nick', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'married', 'icey', 'Bianca', 'Gail', 'Patrick', 'Ellen', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognise', 'dog', 'order', 'see', 'husband', 'Ellen', 'new', 'couple', 'honeymoon', 'hotel', 'where', 'Nick', '.Tennyson', 'plot', 'ENOCH', 'ARDEN', 'source', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'durable', 'Hollywood', 'type', 'comedy', 'was', 'course', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'forte', 'perfection', 'instance', 'when', 'first', 'Ellen', 'elevator', 'doors', 'are', 'closing', 'leaving', 'feet', 'place', 'sideways', 'touching', 'opposite', 'wall', 'body', 'completely', 'bias', 'enacted', 'Grant', 'scene', 'most', 'natural', 'behaviour', 'world', 'off', 'beautifully', 'Overall', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'was', '41', 'here', 'lighthearted', 'cute', 'audience', 'Nick', 'were', 'lose', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'mistake', 'Donald', 'McBride', 'kick', 'suspicious', 'hotel', 'clerk', 'contorting', 'face', 'bulldog', 'pout', 'popping', 'eyes', 'amazement', 'when', 'Grant', 'checks', 'wife', 'colourised', 'version', 'advantageous', 'print', 'sharp', 'clear']",N/A

Cary Grant and Irene Dunne have amazing chemistry in this outrageously funny screwball comedy.Seven years have passed since a lawyer's wife was lost at sea. In that time he's found someone else and wants to get remarried. On the day he files papers to declare her legally dead she returns to prove herself alive and get on with her life. She heads out to the hotel where he's staying for his honeymoon and a series of hilarious shenanigans ensue.Despite this, they try to make efforts to reconcile the relationship. As not to rattle the new wife The old one poses as a southern family friend. When the lawyer learns the man she was shipwrecked with is a real He-man, (I'm going out on a limb here using what I think is 40's slang) He thinks there was something going on between them over those seven years. The movie reaches a hilarious climax in the courtroom and concludes with Grant and Dunne getting back together.My Favorite Wife is great even though it's clunky in some places (I read the director was sick and somebody had to sub for him That would explain the differences in the style for certain scenes.) What keeps the movie solid is Cary Grant's chemistry with Irene Dunne. The two of them give great performances feeling like an old married couple that knows each other very well.My Favorite Wife is definitely worth a buy if not rental. It put a smile on my face.

These two performers who appeared together on screen on three separate occasions in the uproarious comedy gem ""The Awful Truth"", the beautifully poignant ""Penny Serenade"", and in this highly amusing marital comedy from 1940, always displayed a perfect understanding of that most rare quality in film work; that being flawless screen chemistry. Here in ""My Favourite Wife"", they tackle a different kind of comedy situation than in ""The Awful Truth"", however the same unique qualitites that they employed in their firs teffort together are again very evident here in this farce of a woman presumed lost at seas years before suddenly returnign on the dayher husband remarries creating a whole host of complications guarenteed to get the laughter goign at hign octaves. ""My Favourite Wife"", is also famous for having a rather interesting remake history in that it was to be a lush vehicle for Marilyn Monroe and Dean Martin in 1962 under the title ""Something's Got to Give"", which of course never made it to completion because of Monroe's untimely death after which it resurfaced again two years later in 1964 as a vehicle for Box Office Queen Doris Day and James Garner retitled ""Move Over Darling"".
