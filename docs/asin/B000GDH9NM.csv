1002145,A3KUP8IQ3JMS0P,B000GDH9NM,Acid,"[0, 0]","I don't know if this movie went nowhere at theaters because people mistook it for a western, it was poorly promoted, or it's just too damn smart for success. It made for a real surprise on DVD, though. What starts off as a moving romance (albeit kind of creepy due to the massive age difference), slowly turns into something dark and (eventually) violent. I wouldn't call Edward Norton's character evil (as some reviews have). I don't think that his actions are premeditated and I don't think they involve malice. (That is debatable though. The movie, rightfully, doesn't make it perfectly clear.) I think he's a troubled man who has an emotional breakdown when he realizes he's losing the only thing he really cares about. With just some minor changes in the script, David Morse's father could easily have been the traditional, 100% bad guy and Norton could have been the hero who rides in to save the day.The acting and direction are top notch all around. It is seldom that a movie of this quality and maturity is made anymore. There is none of the pretentious artificiality of so many independent films, and none of the compromise common to most Hollywood films. Not quite a masterpiece, but the type of movie that mature, intelligent film-goers should be seeing none-the-less.",4,"Refreshingly mature ""doomed romance""",1270598400,"04 7, 2010",2010,1280,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'went', 'nowhere', 'theaters', 'people', 'mistook', 'western', 'was', 'poorly', 'promoted', 'just', 'too', 'damn', 'smart', 'success', 'made', 'real', 'surprise', 'DVD', 'though', 'What', 'off', 'moving', 'romance', 'kind', 'creepy', 'due', 'massive', 'age', 'difference', 'slowly', 'something', 'dark', 'eventually', 'violent', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'character', 'evil', 'reviews', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'actions', 'are', 'premeditated', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'involve', 'malice', 'debatable', 'movie', 'rightfully', ""n't"", 'make', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'think', 'troubled', 'man', 'who', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'when', 'losing', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'just', 'minor', 'changes', 'script', 'David', 'Morse', 'father', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'traditional', '100', '%', 'bad', 'guy', 'Norton', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'hero', 'who', 'save', 'day.The', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'top', 'around', 'seldom', 'movie', 'quality', 'maturity', 'made', 'anymore', 'none', 'pretentious', 'artificiality', 'so', 'many', 'independent', 'films', 'none', 'compromise', 'common', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'Not', 'quite', 'masterpiece', 'type', 'movie', 'mature', 'intelligent', 'film-goers', 'should', 'be', 'seeing', 'none-the-less']",Down in the Valley
1002146,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000GDH9NM,A Customer,"[19, 20]","Imperfect and overlong, somewhat stretched and overwrought, Down in the Valley is still a beautifully acted and potent take on a dysfunctional working class family and a nave drifter - bordering the edges of sociopathic derangement - who ends up powerfully affecting their lives.Set firmly amongst the freeways, tract-homes and the urban landscape of the San Fernando Valley, Down in the Valley centers on the character of Harlen (Ed Norton), a type of suburban cowboy, who lives in a netherworld of cowboy fantasies and rambles the Valley tipping his dopey hat to the ladies and promising skeptics he will earn their trust.Harlen lives in a shabby motel, and when bored, pretends he's in Western movie shootouts playing with his guns and lassoing the kitchen chairs. He's been working as a gas station attendant that is until he meets the equally unmoored Tobe (Evan Rachel Wood). Tobe is the defiant and languorously beautiful teenage daughter of a local jail sheriff (hunky David Morse) and Harlan courts her with a cool self-composure.Of course, from our eyes - and from Tobe's father's - Harlen is nothing but a white trash loser, a dolt who's probably verging on the edge of sanity. But the lovely Tobe doesn't see him this way and she falls for his old-world and romantic cowboy ways when he's actually more innocent and psychologically even younger than Tobe.Harlen is in reality a child, a man out of place ""down in the valley,"" this land of fast-paced activity, modern rules and where people never get out of their cars. Yet he's also impetuous and manipulative and often acts on the spur of the moment without thinking of the consequences. The first serious signs of trouble come when Harlan takes Tobe to the country for a ride on a white horse that belongs to an eccentric rancher (Bruce Dern) he claims is a friend, and the ""friend"" pursues them with a gun.Harlen also holds Tobe's kid brother Lonnie (Rory Culkin) in his complicated thrall. Things get really out of hand when Harlen starts playing off Lonnie and Tobe's affections with their belligerent, protective father and supplying Lonnie with the simple love and attention the boy (and maybe Harlan himself) has never had.Of course it's inevitable that the shielding father and the wayward boyfriend inevitably clash, and much of the tension of the movie comes from how this relationship eventually plays out. Down in the Valley begins like just another blue collar domestic drama, full of mis-communication and misbegotten tension, but then it radically veers off course, hurtling into the realms of myth and allegory.Harlan always wanted to be a cowboy and in the final denouement he gets what he wants - but at a price. Then his problems become too overwhelming for Tobe, for Lonnie, for the law, for himself. The climax, a wildly symbolic cinematic chase through the little wilderness that's left, detours across a Western movie set, where all the gun violence begins to take it's toll.Writer and director David Jacobson builds a rich setting for the inevitable dramatics, the action taking place in a land of American myth that's gone terribly wrong. Jacobson's characters are so richly drawn and his actors to phenomenal in their respective roles, that you can forgive the movie for becoming a little heavy handed and to some extent losing its way towards the end.

1002147,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000GDH9NM,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","It doesn't completely nail what it's apparently going for, but surprisingly `Down in the Valley' stays with you longer than you'd expect.  With riveting performances (Norton and Morse are simply outstanding) and an intriguing plot that tackles weighty subjects and stands out as uniquely visionary, `Down in the Valley' is a film you are bound to remember, even if you don't enjoy it.I mean, let's face it; this is NOT a film for everyone.The film centers around a borderline sociopath named Harlan Carruthers.  Harlan uses his comical persona as a way to escape the redundancy of his life.  He hasn't a steady job or a love life and he's living in a string of motels.  His life starts to unravel when he meets Tobe, a young an impetuous teenager who sees a relationship with Harlan as a way to escape her seemingly domesticated existence.  She is bored, and she wants to experience something exciting.  Despite Harlan's near-ridiculousness, he is exciting and Tobe envies that.  Her father is not impressed.  He sees right through Harlan's exterior.  He sees the mental deterioration, not necessarily in a `handicapped' kind of way.  He sees that Harlan has `lost his grip', that he is living in his own world, and he knows that it is dangerous.I actually love the comparisons made to `Taxi Driver', for it helps me look at the film a little differently, and may even induce a completely different reaction from me upon another look.  I personally consider `Taxi Driver' to be one of the finest films ever made, and the message it conveys is poignant even today.  `Down in the Valley' attempts to `go there', but I think that it falls just short of really `going there'.  It needed to filter through Harlan's mental state a little more, really give him some more layers.  I will admit, at first Harlan can come off as a tad corny and it's almost a deterrent, but Norton works wonders with this character and brings it all together in the end (or at least the best that he can).  Still, the film almost feels as if it has more to say that maybe it doesn't know how to convey.That said, it has more than enough going for it to make it a MUST SEE type film.The acting is the films key selling point.  Norton had a banner year in '06, with this and `The Illusionist' and `The Painted Veil', and while this isn't his best film (`The Painted Veil' is a near masterpiece), this is by far his best performance.  He just really pulls this together.  Like I said, he starts off almost like a caricature, but he really molds this man perfectly in the end.  For me though, this film belongs to David Morse.  His portrayal of a single father struggling to protect his children is heartbreakingly realistic.  His outbursts are so heartfelt and emotionally invested.  You can see him working things out in his head, his eyes glazing over with aggravated foreknowledge.Evan Rachel Wood and Rory Culkin more than hold their own, and Wood especially has a few scenes that prove her `thirteen' stint wasn't just luck.It has a lot going for it, even if it doesn't quite pull it `all' together in the end.  I'd certainly recommend this film.  It is tense, original and for the most part very engaging.  Norton is fantastic and Morse is Oscar worthy.  It's a small gem of a film that you may not have ever known existed.",4,"Down, down, down...",1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,3299,"[""n't"", 'completely', 'nail', 'what', 'apparently', 'going', 'surprisingly', 'Down', 'Valley', 'stays', 'longer', ""'d"", 'expect', 'riveting', 'performances', 'Norton', 'Morse', 'are', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'weighty', 'subjects', 'out', 'uniquely', 'visionary', 'Down', 'Valley', 'film', 'are', 'bound', 'remember', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'it.I', 'mean', 'let', 'face', 'NOT', 'film', 'everyone.The', 'film', 'centers', 'borderline', 'sociopath', 'named', 'Harlan', 'Carruthers', 'Harlan', 'comical', 'persona', 'way', 'escape', 'redundancy', 'life', ""n't"", 'steady', 'job', 'love', 'life', 'living', 'string', 'motels', 'life', 'unravel', 'when', 'Tobe', 'young', 'impetuous', 'teenager', 'who', 'relationship', 'Harlan', 'way', 'escape', 'seemingly', 'domesticated', 'existence', 'bored', 'experience', 'something', 'exciting', 'Harlan', 'near-ridiculousness', 'exciting', 'Tobe', 'envies', 'father', 'not', 'impressed', 'right', 'Harlan', 'exterior', 'mental', 'deterioration', 'not', 'necessarily', 'handicapped', 'kind', 'way', 'Harlan', 'lost', 'grip', 'living', 'own', 'world', 'dangerous.I', 'actually', 'love', 'comparisons', 'made', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'look', 'film', 'little', 'differently', 'may', 'even', 'induce', 'completely', 'different', 'reaction', 'look', 'personally', 'consider', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'message', 'poignant', 'even', 'today', 'Down', 'Valley', 'attempts', 'go', 'think', 'just', 'short', 'really', 'going', 'there', 'needed', 'filter', 'Harlan', 'mental', 'state', 'little', 'more', 'really', 'give', 'more', 'layers', 'will', 'admit', 'first', 'Harlan', 'can', 'come', 'off', 'tad', 'corny', 'almost', 'deterrent', 'Norton', 'wonders', 'character', 'together', 'end', 'least', 'best', 'can', 'Still', 'film', 'almost', 'feels', 'more', 'say', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'said', 'more', 'enough', 'going', 'make', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'film.The', 'acting', 'films', 'key', 'selling', 'point', 'Norton', 'had', 'banner', 'year', ""'06"", 'Illusionist', 'Painted', 'Veil', ""n't"", 'best', 'film', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'near', 'masterpiece', 'far', 'best', 'performance', 'just', 'really', 'together', 'said', 'almost', 'caricature', 'really', 'man', 'perfectly', 'end', 'film', 'David', 'Morse', 'portrayal', 'single', 'father', 'struggling', 'protect', 'children', 'heartbreakingly', 'realistic', 'outbursts', 'are', 'so', 'heartfelt', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'can', 'see', 'working', 'things', 'out', 'head', 'eyes', 'glazing', 'aggravated', 'foreknowledge.Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'more', 'hold', 'own', 'Wood', 'especially', 'few', 'scenes', 'prove', 'thirteen', 'stint', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'luck.It', 'lot', 'going', 'even', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'together', 'end', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'recommend', 'film', 'tense', 'original', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'engaging', 'Norton', 'fantastic', 'Morse', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'small', 'gem', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'ever', 'known', 'existed']",Down in the Valley
1002148,A2JO8RUJARRKQI,B000GDH9NM,Ben F. Small,"[15, 16]","Nice, charming Harlan, played superbly by Ed Norton, a gas station attendant from out of town who's never been to the beach takes a ride from the nubile girl with 'gumption"" according to her booding father, played by David Morse. But the beautiful and comely October is underage, and Papa doesn't like the older and somewhat weird Norton dating October, so he forbids their liasons. But Harlan doesn't take no for an answer, and when he can't find October, he settles for her little brother, taking the young boy on another stolen horse ride and teaching him how to shoot .45 revolvers.On their return, Daddy is waiting, and pulls a gun on Harlan, threatens he'll use it if Harlan ever darkens their door again. Harlan responds by breaking into the home, stealing October's Daddy's .45 and packing her a bag. But October won't leave. Tempers fly and October is shot. Harlan tells October's brother October was shot by their father, and that only Harlan can rescue the boy from being a ward of the state. Another horse is stolen, and Harlan and the boy are on the run from the cops and October's father through the hills above the San Fernando Valley. Shots are fired and people go down. But Harlan and the boy are still on the run, and October's wounded father is hot on their heels.This movie charms and frightens the viewer. Harlan's progression into madness is slow and masked by his easy going nature, his simple humor and by his easy smile. But underneath, Harlan is seething, roiling in a world that doesn't fit him. A cowboy out of his element. A dead shot with a lightning quick draw. Harlan knows he's going to die, and he's determined to take some people with him.Meanwhile, the children's father is finding ways to bridge the resentments which have split his family apart over time. Coping with adolesence can be tough for a hardened man pre-occupied with his corrections job and looking for love. Once disinterested and authoritative toward his children, the father discovers the depth of his love for his children, and learns new ways to communicate it. adversity can bring people together.This is an excellent movie, but one which will keep you guessing. Both Ed Norton and David Morse perform their roles as if they were born to them.

1002149,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000GDH9NM,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[7, 8]","Try and imagine a modern day western film taking place in bustling Los Angeles County, complete with an ""Aw-shucks"", white hat toting, young man in love with a girl who's not quite of legal age yet, and you'll come close to grasping DOWN IN THE VALLEY.The story is set purely in L.A. as we watch a cowpoke named Harlan (Edward Norton, THE ILLUSIONIST) walk into town wearing Levi's and a frayed rope draped over one shoulder. The dichotomy is immediately striking as planes fly over his head and power lines droop across roadways.Then we jump to a small family that lives in L.A. and are having troubles. Tobe (Evan Rachel Wood, THE MISSING) is a very pretty young high schooler who lives with her burly father Wade (David Morse, 16 BLOCKS) and her clingy brother Lonnie (Rory Culkin, SIGNS). Tobe is growing too fast into womanhood and independence, and she and her father constantly joust with each other regarding curfews, clothing, and being a responsible teen.  Lonnie latches onto Tobe all the time, a lost little brother whom Tobe is growing tired of raising since her father works all the time to help support them. And Lonnie isn't Wade's son, being an adopted family member but still a significant part of their lives.One sunny day Tobe and her friends pull into a gas station to fuel up and encounter the ""for real"" cowboy, Harlan. Tobe is immediately attracted to him and invites him to go to the beach with her and her friends. Harlan accepts at the cost of his job, simply walking away from it. The two form an instant relationship and all appears sweet.But when Tobe's father Wade finds out about it, he's less than happy. Harlan tries to steal into his good graces but Wade will have none of it. His parental guard goes up and puts the brakes on their relationship.Initially we're pulling for Harlan and Tobe to become the ideal star-crossed lovers, battling family and circumstances in order to ride off into the sunset. But all is an illusion as we see Harlan's cowboy facade crumbling under the weight of a doomed relationship. Not willing to give up, Harlan tries anything he can fathom to get back into the family's good graces. This includes taking young Lonnie out shooting, stealing horses for daylong trips, and finally doing the unthinkable of unthinkables.The fascinating portrayal of a wannabe cowpoke in today's society is excellently done by Edward Norton. He is so adorable in the beginning that most female viewers will probably fawn over him. But when his steady psychological break starts showing, a terrible realization hits the audience; Harlan isn't Harlan at all.The film comes complete with panoramic views of the San Fernando Valley atop lush hills, giving us a truly western feel to the movie, and there's even a quick draw shoot out that'll both entertain and repulse most movie watchers.The only downside is the ending. With all that happened to Tobe, Lonnie, and Wade at the hands of Harlan, it didn't make sense that they would ""honor"" him in this way (no spoilers).But this is still a fantastic psychological, modern day western. Norton is lovable and creepy both at the same time.",4,Beware Cowboys Wearing White Hats,1161734400,"10 25, 2006",2006,3127,"['Try', 'imagine', 'modern', 'day', 'western', 'film', 'taking', 'place', 'bustling', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'County', 'complete', 'Aw-shucks', 'white', 'hat', 'toting', 'young', 'man', 'love', 'girl', 'who', 'not', 'quite', 'legal', 'age', 'yet', ""'ll"", 'come', 'close', 'grasping', 'DOWN', 'IN', 'THE', 'VALLEY.The', 'story', 'set', 'purely', 'L.A.', 'watch', 'cowpoke', 'named', 'Harlan', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'THE', 'ILLUSIONIST', 'walk', 'town', 'wearing', 'Levi', 'frayed', 'rope', 'draped', 'one', 'shoulder', 'dichotomy', 'immediately', 'striking', 'planes', 'fly', 'head', 'power', 'lines', 'droop', 'roadways.Then', 'jump', 'small', 'family', 'L.A.', 'are', 'having', 'troubles', 'Tobe', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'THE', 'MISSING', 'very', 'pretty', 'young', 'high', 'schooler', 'who', 'burly', 'father', 'Wade', 'David', 'Morse', '16', 'BLOCKS', 'clingy', 'brother', 'Lonnie', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'SIGNS', 'Tobe', 'growing', 'too', 'fast', 'womanhood', 'independence', 'father', 'constantly', 'other', 'regarding', 'curfews', 'clothing', 'being', 'responsible', 'teen', 'Lonnie', 'Tobe', 'time', 'lost', 'little', 'brother', 'whom', 'Tobe', 'growing', 'tired', 'raising', 'father', 'time', 'help', 'support', 'Lonnie', ""n't"", 'Wade', 'son', 'being', 'adopted', 'family', 'member', 'still', 'significant', 'part', 'lives.One', 'sunny', 'day', 'Tobe', 'friends', 'pull', 'gas', 'station', 'fuel', 'up', 'encounter', 'real', 'cowboy', 'Harlan', 'Tobe', 'immediately', 'attracted', 'go', 'beach', 'friends', 'Harlan', 'cost', 'job', 'simply', 'walking', 'away', 'two', 'form', 'instant', 'relationship', 'sweet.But', 'when', 'Tobe', 'father', 'Wade', 'out', 'less', 'happy', 'Harlan', 'steal', 'good', 'graces', 'Wade', 'will', 'have', 'none', 'parental', 'guard', 'up', 'brakes', 'relationship.Initially', ""'re"", 'pulling', 'Harlan', 'Tobe', 'become', 'ideal', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'battling', 'family', 'circumstances', 'order', 'ride', 'off', 'sunset', 'illusion', 'see', 'Harlan', 'cowboy', 'facade', 'crumbling', 'weight', 'doomed', 'relationship', 'Not', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'Harlan', 'anything', 'can', 'fathom', 'get', 'back', 'family', 'good', 'graces', 'taking', 'young', 'Lonnie', 'shooting', 'stealing', 'horses', 'daylong', 'trips', 'finally', 'doing', 'unthinkable', 'unthinkables.The', 'fascinating', 'portrayal', 'wannabe', 'cowpoke', 'today', 'society', 'excellently', 'done', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'so', 'adorable', 'beginning', 'most', 'female', 'viewers', 'will', 'probably', 'fawn', 'when', 'steady', 'psychological', 'break', 'showing', 'terrible', 'realization', 'audience', 'Harlan', ""n't"", 'Harlan', 'all.The', 'film', 'complete', 'panoramic', 'views', 'San', 'Fernando', 'Valley', 'lush', 'hills', 'giving', 'truly', 'western', 'feel', 'movie', 'even', 'quick', 'draw', 'shoot', ""'ll"", 'entertain', 'repulse', 'most', 'movie', 'only', 'downside', 'ending', 'happened', 'Tobe', 'Lonnie', 'Wade', 'hands', 'Harlan', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'would', 'honor', 'way', 'spoilers', '.But', 'still', 'fantastic', 'psychological', 'modern', 'day', 'western', 'Norton', 'lovable', 'creepy', 'same', 'time']",Down in the Valley
1002150,AJDQ5EBQNDGLF,B000GDH9NM,Bob L,"[0, 0]","Another fine performance by Ed Norton is the best selling point for mostly predictable Think entry. As with most Think entries, the look is lush and very easy to take, as is the score.The story of no-account cowboy Norton getting involved with young girl and her younger brother, much to the dismay of their stepfather, goes down as a little forced.

Aside from structure, I don't think it's really about being compared to the old west as much as it tries to speak about striving for identity and to be close with others.  The cowboy deal just happens to be the clothes Norton's character wears, but I get the feeling it could have been a pirate outfit, really, without changing his character's purpose.  Of course the land one inherits in life is connected to one's identity, so what is left of that, the film asks.I disagree that this movie is a mix of Taxi Driver and Lolita.  For one, Norton's age isn't mentioned, and is in fact never brough up as an issue even by the girls's protective father.  So the Lolita comparison is brought entirely by the reviewer.  Taxi Driver?  I can see that more.  But I think any discussion of that leads to thinking more about what Taxi Driver is about more than what Down in the Valley is about.The film does feel familiar in a lot of ways.  And it goes on for a little while longer than it should...to me it should have begun wrapping it up soon after Tober maded her decision about Norton's character (I'm being vague about all this on purpose).Other than that, the music is wonderful, there are a lot of great moments, and the movie is pretty compelling.

1002153,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000GDH9NM,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[7, 12]","I feel as though I sat in on this film with a past that led me to have a different set of priorities than the film itself. The story is an oldie, but one that never gets old. Harlan (Edward Norton) falls in love with Tobe (Evan Rachel Wood). Harlan, being a bit older and a bit odder than Tobe manages to severely tick off her dad Wade. A huge chest pounding contest occurs, and this being a melodrama, tragedy ensues. The film wants to be a cautionary tale on why it's a good idea to chase the boyfriend away; I prefer to view it as why you shouldn't chase the boyfriend away.Yes, Harlan does eventually degenerate into a life of pain and violence. But it is only after he treats Tobe and her family with an absurd amount of respect. And is after Wade, fighting the natural progression that says that boyfriend replaces the father, pulls a gun on Harlan and tells him to stay away from his family. Sometimes when a society views a person as something it only leads said person to become more like societies view of them. A self fulfilling prophecy, if you will. Six years ago I started dating a girl and her parents used every Gestapo tactic in the book to chase me away, but it didn't work. Rather it led to them being eliminated from the girl's life. In this film we learn that that same principle can be applied to a gun. The only crime Harlan had committed up until the gun pulling was admitting to Wade that he was a rancher. I think it's time dads stopped chasing away boyfriends simply because they don't hold jobs that the dad's themselves wished they had.While the plot is fairly by the book, it does have a few tricks up its sleeve. Unfortunately, it never reaches the dramatic heights or intellectual depths that it is capable of. But I'll happily accept what I am given here. The fact that the climax manages to wander onto an Old West movie set is less forgivable. I did, however, enjoy the acting. Edward Norton may not be believable as the misplaced cowboy, but I sure had fun watching as he gave it his all. Evan Rachel Wood is an actor who I will show up for every time, no matter what she is in. I'm not so deluded to think that it has nothing to do with her looks, nor so cynical to think that they are the only reason. Her films and performances speak to me because she reminds me of every girl I knew growing up. So, while this is not her best performance (um... ""Thirteen"" . . . hello) it is still solid. She does go all out, but not as far out as Anne Hathaway went in ""Havoc."" In the end this film isn't really about old world vs. new world, but rather boyfriend vs. father. It is far easier for fathers to follow their instincts and chase their replacements away, but this film shows just how bloody that path can become. ***1/2",3,The Circle of Violence in the New West,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,2754,"['feel', 'sat', 'film', 'past', 'led', 'have', 'different', 'set', 'priorities', 'film', 'story', 'oldie', 'one', 'never', 'old', 'Harlan', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'love', 'Tobe', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Harlan', 'being', 'bit', 'older', 'bit', 'odder', 'Tobe', 'severely', 'tick', 'off', 'dad', 'Wade', 'A', 'huge', 'chest', 'pounding', 'contest', 'occurs', 'being', 'melodrama', 'tragedy', 'ensues', 'film', 'be', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'why', 'good', 'idea', 'chase', 'boyfriend', 'away', 'prefer', 'view', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'chase', 'boyfriend', 'away.Yes', 'Harlan', 'eventually', 'degenerate', 'life', 'pain', 'violence', 'only', 'Tobe', 'family', 'absurd', 'amount', 'respect', 'Wade', 'fighting', 'natural', 'progression', 'boyfriend', 'father', 'gun', 'Harlan', 'stay', 'away', 'family', 'Sometimes', 'when', 'society', 'person', 'something', 'only', 'said', 'person', 'become', 'more', 'like', 'societies', 'view', 'self', 'fulfilling', 'prophecy', 'will', 'Six', 'years', 'ago', 'started', 'dating', 'girl', 'parents', 'used', 'Gestapo', 'tactic', 'book', 'chase', 'away', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Rather', 'led', 'being', 'eliminated', 'girl', 'life', 'film', 'learn', 'same', 'principle', 'can', 'be', 'applied', 'gun', 'only', 'crime', 'Harlan', 'had', 'committed', 'up', 'gun', 'pulling', 'was', 'admitting', 'Wade', 'was', 'rancher', 'think', 'time', 'dads', 'stopped', 'chasing', 'away', 'boyfriends', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'jobs', 'dad', 'wished', 'had.While', 'plot', 'fairly', 'book', 'have', 'few', 'tricks', 'up', 'sleeve', 'Unfortunately', 'never', 'dramatic', 'heights', 'intellectual', 'depths', 'capable', ""'ll"", 'happily', 'accept', 'what', 'am', 'given', 'here', 'fact', 'climax', 'wander', 'Old', 'West', 'movie', 'set', 'less', 'forgivable', 'did', 'however', 'enjoy', 'acting', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'believable', 'misplaced', 'cowboy', 'sure', 'had', 'fun', 'watching', 'gave', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'actor', 'who', 'will', 'show', 'up', 'time', 'matter', 'what', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'deluded', 'think', 'nothing', 'do', 'so', 'cynical', 'think', 'are', 'only', 'reason', 'films', 'performances', 'speak', 'girl', 'knew', 'growing', 'up', 'So', 'not', 'best', 'performance', 'um', 'Thirteen', 'hello', 'still', 'solid', 'go', 'out', 'not', 'far', 'out', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'went', 'Havoc', 'end', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'old', 'world', 'vs.', 'new', 'world', 'rather', 'boyfriend', 'vs.', 'father', 'far', 'easier', 'fathers', 'follow', 'instincts', 'chase', 'replacements', 'away', 'film', 'just', 'how', 'bloody', 'path', 'can', 'become', '***1/2']",Down in the Valley

It's almost oddly compelling and, even though it's on the strange side of believable it ends up working so well due to the very talented cast involved.  Young Tobe (Evan Rachel Wood in yet another brilliant performance) is already on the verge of rebellion when she meets Harlon Carruthers (Edward Norton).  He's older than she is and slightly odd (he thinks he's a cowboy) but she's drawn to him, maybe because she knows her father wouldn't approve or maybe because he's so different than anyone she's ever known that he fascinates her.  I think, perhaps, it's a little of both.  Their relationship starts off heavy and passionate, but when Harlon almost gets Tobe arrested her father Wade (David Morse) tries to put a stop to their relationship.Harlon refuses to be torn apart from the girl he loves and so he convinces both Tobe and her younger brother Lonnie (Rory Culkin) that Wade is unreasonable and they should leave with him.  After a horrible accident leaves Tobe in critical condition the film turns from a slightly eerie drama to a game of cat and mouse as Wade tries to avenge his daughter while Harlon continues to pollute young Lonnie's mind, turning him against his father and causing him to place himself in danger for Harlon's sake.  Thank goodness for Edward Norton who plays his character with enough originality and genuine calm collected composure that Harlon, in all his insanity comes off real and somewhat believable, even when he's jumping around his apartment shooting at imaginary people.The acting itself is a huge asset to this film which thrives on the believability of its characters to over shadow the hole-ridden plot.  Evan Rachel Wood delivers yet another knock out performance as Tobe and she gives her character the same amount of realism she conveyed in `thirteen' proving that she is a definite young star to look out for (we have so many young actresses really shining as of late, Wood to Scarlett Johansson to Kiera Knightly, Ellen Page and Camilla Belle we have a wide range of talented new comers).  I was probably most impressed with David Morse's protective father, for he played his character with so much frustration and genuine parental concern that he elevates his character from stock to influential.  He, to me, has the most powerful scenes in the film from his confrontations with his daughter to his verbal battle with Harlon.As a whole this may be a difficult film to swallow.  It's a little far fetched that a man that obviously strange could have such a strong grip on these two children, especially when neither of them seem to be slow or, for lack of a better word, stupid.  He may have seemed like an escape from a world they've grown bored of, but it's really not the story but the performances that make this movie one worth watching.  Edward Norton is always capable of delivering a spot on performance, and while Harlon is no where near as powerful as say Derek from `American History X' or his narrator in `Fight Club' he is still outstanding here and proves yet again that he is one of our finest working actors.",4,"While it's a bit difficult to swallow, 'Down in the Valley' serves up some top notch performances...",1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,3134,"['Down', 'Valley', 'weird', 'type', 'entertainment', 'almost', 'oddly', 'compelling', 'even', 'strange', 'side', 'believable', 'up', 'working', 'so', 'well', 'due', 'very', 'talented', 'cast', 'involved', 'Young', 'Tobe', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'yet', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'already', 'verge', 'rebellion', 'when', 'Harlon', 'Carruthers', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'older', 'slightly', 'odd', 'cowboy', 'drawn', 'maybe', 'father', 'would', ""n't"", 'approve', 'maybe', 'so', 'different', 'anyone', 'ever', 'known', 'think', 'perhaps', 'little', 'relationship', 'heavy', 'passionate', 'when', 'Harlon', 'almost', 'Tobe', 'arrested', 'father', 'Wade', 'David', 'Morse', 'put', 'stop', 'relationship.Harlon', 'be', 'torn', 'apart', 'girl', 'so', 'Tobe', 'younger', 'brother', 'Lonnie', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'Wade', 'unreasonable', 'should', 'leave', 'horrible', 'accident', 'Tobe', 'critical', 'condition', 'film', 'slightly', 'eerie', 'drama', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Wade', 'avenge', 'daughter', 'Harlon', 'pollute', 'young', 'Lonnie', 'mind', 'turning', 'father', 'causing', 'place', 'danger', 'Harlon', 'sake', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'who', 'character', 'enough', 'originality', 'genuine', 'calm', 'collected', 'composure', 'Harlon', 'insanity', 'real', 'somewhat', 'believable', 'even', 'when', 'jumping', 'apartment', 'shooting', 'imaginary', 'people.The', 'acting', 'huge', 'asset', 'film', 'believability', 'characters', 'hole-ridden', 'plot', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'delivers', 'yet', 'knock', 'out', 'performance', 'Tobe', 'character', 'same', 'amount', 'realism', 'conveyed', 'thirteen', 'proving', 'definite', 'young', 'star', 'look', 'out', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'young', 'actresses', 'really', 'shining', 'late', 'Wood', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Kiera', 'Knightly', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'have', 'wide', 'range', 'talented', 'new', 'comers', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'impressed', 'David', 'Morse', 'protective', 'father', 'played', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'frustration', 'genuine', 'parental', 'concern', 'character', 'stock', 'influential', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'film', 'confrontations', 'daughter', 'verbal', 'battle', 'Harlon.As', 'whole', 'may', 'be', 'difficult', 'film', 'swallow', 'little', 'far', 'fetched', 'man', 'obviously', 'strange', 'could', 'have', 'strong', 'grip', 'two', 'children', 'especially', 'when', 'seem', 'be', 'slow', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'stupid', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'escape', 'world', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'bored', 'really', 'not', 'story', 'performances', 'make', 'movie', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'always', 'capable', 'delivering', 'spot', 'performance', 'Harlon', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'powerful', 'say', 'Derek', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'narrator', 'Fight', 'Club', 'still', 'outstanding', 'here', 'yet', 'again', 'one', 'finest', 'working', 'actors']",Down in the Valley

Evan Rachel Wood is not just another pretty face, but a young woman with acting chops and great instincts beyond her years.  Ms. Woods also has star quality; she eats the lens.Despite their obvious age differences, Ms. Woods, Tobe, leads the cowboy Harlan played by Edward Norton, into her world of sex and drugs, which she will come to rue, as Harlan is anything but what he seems.David Morse does a fine job as Wade, a man in an emotional tug of war with Harlan, for his rebellious, and out-of-control daughter.  Wade seems a man not quite sure how he found himself as head of this disfunctional household.  Rory Culkin following in McCauley's footsteps turns in an amazing performance as Lonnie, the insecure and frightened younger brother, who finds in Harlan a hero, protector and a friend.The San Fernando Valley itself plays the title role.  This middle class suburb of L.A., becomes the ""old west"" for Harlan and Tobe, riding a stolen horse, owned by a cantakerous old man (played by Bruce Dern) straight out of a western.  The inevitable showdown between Harlan and Wade begins on the set of a western, with cameras and crew conveniently out of view so one wonders if the set exists or is part of Harlan's fantasy. In the DVD EXTRA's there are deleted scenes that make clear that it is indeed a tv set.Is Wade actually the children's father, or merely a guardian as Lonnie relates to Harlan and if so how did he come to be their guardian.  From the way the children play their scenes, I sensed that Tobe is Wade's child; while Lonnie is not.  Are we to assume that Harlan's warning to Lonnie of the dangers of the foster care/juvenile justice system, were visited upon the person of Martin Weiss?  The filmmaker credits the viewer with a few smarts; and leaves these questions for the audience to decide, just as the children will have to decide for themselves the impact of Harlan's presence in their lives.

1002161,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000GDH9NM,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","It takes a certain mindset to appreciate DOWN IN THE VALLEY, a quiet little movie about little people who want something more than what their environs offer.  The film is long (just over two hours), could use some editing, allows a rather pedestrian musical score to cover the dialogue far too frequently, and for much of the film the camera exposure makes everything so sun drenched (even for the San Fernando Valley where the story takes place!) that it feels bleached.  But those aspects feel secondary in the presence of some very fine performances by an excellent cast directed with vision by writer/director David Jacobson.Life is exceedingly boring in the bland town where Tobe (Evan Rachel Wood) and her little brother Lonny (Rory Culkin) live with their sheriff father Wayne (David Morse) - we never know why there is no mother around though Wayne brings in sleepover subs at random.  Tobe has girlfriends with whom she cruises guys and on one afternoon's trip to the beach she meets gas station attendant Harlan (Edward Norton), a drifter who claims to be a rancher form South Dakota and has all the genteel manners of a gentleman raised to respect women.  Harlan lives in a trashy motel, plays and dresses as a cowboy, and has an innocence about him that makes us want to believe he is not the borderline personality he is.  Tobe picks Harlan up, they begin seeing each other despite Wayne's better judgment, and Tobe and Harlan include Lonny in their pursuit of a world that borders on make believe Western drama.  Wayne objects more strongly, discovers Harlan is tempting Tobe away from her home, and confronts Harlan until Harlan finally decides the only way to move forward is to rescue Tobe and Lonny from their bad homelife.  Harlan's dark side emerges and his cowboy play becomes real, gunshots are fired and the ending of the film is a m&eacute;lange of old Western movie make-believe and contemporary tragedy of a young man out of joint with his world.Edward Norton gives a stunning portrayal of an out of touch drifter: we never know his background except for suggestions that his childhood was spent in detention homes, foster homes, and other dysfunctional modes of getting by.  Evan Rachel Wood is radiantly beautiful as the needy teenager who ultimately cannot cope with her desires to leave the home nest.  Rory Culkin has few lines but his presence is palpably worrisome.  Bruce Dern is on board as a crusty old contemporary 'cowboy' and David Morse again turns in a performance that is three dimensional and credible (it would have been helpful to know why he is a single parent).  The film is not without its flaws (as mentioned above plus more), but it manages to give Edward Norton yet another chance to demonstrate his considerable skills as an actor who can make the most peripheral characters stick in our hearts.  This is a fine little movie, much underrated.

1002164,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000GDH9NM,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 6]","""Down in the Valley"" is the 2nd film by David Jacobson, who's previous film ""Dahmer"" was released straight-to-video. For good reason too. When he released that film, it was just another film in a series of straight-to-video films about serial killers. Out of the 5 I can think of off the top of my head (Ed Gein, Gacy, Ted Bundy, Dahmer, and Evilenko). That was the 2nd best.But, it was a terrible movie. It was inaccurate, had a straight-to-video feel to it, and was a waste of time. It was the 2nd best because the acting was good and the cinematography was professional looking. When he made this film, it looked like it's future would be the same as Dahmer. Producer/Star Edward Norton fought to get it put in theatres and looking at the finished product, I'm glad. This is not a film that should be released straight-to-video. It's a good movie. Norton plays Harlan, a cowboy living in California's San Fernado Valley. He talks with a accent and has all the mannerisms of your classic western cowboys. He claims he's from South Dakota, but it seems that he's making up stories as he goes. While working at a gas station, Harlan meets Tobe (the very talented and beautiful Evan Rachel Wood) a rebellious 16-year old girl. For the record, Tobe isn't pronounced Toby. It's short for October and rhymes with ""globe."" Despite the age difference, there's never a weird stautory-rape overtone here; At least from my viewpoint. Harlan is charming and also befriends Tobe's younger brother Lonnie (Rory Culkin, also young and talented)...The only person Harlan fails to befriend is the brother and sister's dad Wade (the always fantastic and always underrated David Morse); Wade is a security guard (I'm pretty sure, they never really elaborate) and takes an almost instant dislike to Harlan that only gets worse as the story continues. This movie is frequently compared to Taxi Driver and I'm pretty sure writer/director Jacobson noticed too. In one scene, Harlan talks to his reflection in a mirror. The only way to have made it more obvious would to have had Harlan say ""You talkin' to me?"" The movie opened to mixed reviews; Roger Ebert gave it a hesitant thumbs down, Richard Roeper didn't care for it. Peter Travers (critic for Rolling Stone) fell in love with it. I'm going to have to take the side of Travers and Ebert. I know I gave the film 5 stars, but that's for entertainment not necessarily quality. I loved the movie; It was entertaining and the performances are great, but it's definitely flawed. First off, some of the characters make decisions that aren't very characteristic of them. I found myself liking the deceitful and mentally unstable Harlan more than the loving and sometimes violent Wade. The film's ending is a little gratuitously violent (something I've never complained about).It's not for everybody, a lot of people besides critics haven't liked it. Edward Norton proves, once again, that he is an amazing actor with a lot of range. This is one of his best performances. Evan Rachel Wood has played this character at least twice (Thirteen and Pretty Persuasion). The only difference between this character and the other two is Tobe is rebellious, but she's a nice girl overall. The scenes between Wood and Culkin are very true (a lot of the scenes were inspired by Jacobson's childhood). I have a theory that more people will dislike this movie than not, but it's a big step forward for Jacobson and I can't stress enough how good it really is. It's haunting, it will stay with you (whether you liked it or not), and it's really well done.FACTORING IN ALL THE FLAWS: BGRADE: A-",5,Down in the Valley,1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,3605,"['Down', 'Valley', '2nd', 'film', 'David', 'Jacobson', 'who', 'previous', 'film', 'Dahmer', 'was', 'released', 'straight-to-video', 'good', 'reason', 'too', 'When', 'released', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'film', 'series', 'straight-to-video', 'films', 'serial', 'killers', '5', 'can', 'think', 'top', 'head', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'Gacy', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'Dahmer', 'Evilenko', 'was', '2nd', 'best.But', 'was', 'terrible', 'movie', 'was', 'inaccurate', 'had', 'straight-to-video', 'feel', 'was', 'waste', 'time', 'was', '2nd', 'best', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'cinematography', 'was', 'professional', 'looking', 'When', 'made', 'film', 'looked', 'future', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'Dahmer', 'Producer/Star', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'fought', 'get', 'put', 'theatres', 'looking', 'finished', 'product', ""'m"", 'glad', 'not', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'released', 'straight-to-video', 'good', 'movie', 'Norton', 'Harlan', 'cowboy', 'living', 'California', 'San', 'Fernado', 'Valley', 'accent', 'mannerisms', 'classic', 'western', 'cowboys', 'South', 'Dakota', 'making', 'up', 'stories', 'working', 'gas', 'station', 'Harlan', 'Tobe', 'very', 'talented', 'beautiful', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'rebellious', '16-year', 'old', 'girl', 'record', 'Tobe', ""n't"", 'pronounced', 'Toby', 'short', 'October', 'rhymes', 'globe', 'age', 'difference', 'never', 'weird', 'stautory-rape', 'overtone', 'here', 'least', 'viewpoint', 'Harlan', 'charming', 'also', 'Tobe', 'younger', 'brother', 'Lonnie', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'also', 'young', 'talented', 'only', 'person', 'Harlan', 'befriend', 'brother', 'sister', 'dad', 'Wade', 'always', 'fantastic', 'always', 'underrated', 'David', 'Morse', 'Wade', 'security', 'guard', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'never', 'really', 'elaborate', 'almost', 'instant', 'dislike', 'Harlan', 'only', 'worse', 'story', 'movie', 'frequently', 'compared', 'Taxi', 'Driver', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'writer/director', 'Jacobson', 'noticed', 'too', 'one', 'scene', 'Harlan', 'reflection', 'mirror', 'only', 'way', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'obvious', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'Harlan', 'say', 'talkin', 'movie', 'opened', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'gave', 'hesitant', 'thumbs', 'down', 'Richard', 'Roeper', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Peter', 'Travers', 'critic', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'fell', 'love', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'take', 'side', 'Travers', 'Ebert', 'know', 'gave', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'entertainment', 'not', 'necessarily', 'quality', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'definitely', 'flawed', 'First', 'off', 'characters', 'make', 'decisions', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'characteristic', 'found', 'liking', 'deceitful', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'Harlan', 'more', 'loving', 'sometimes', 'violent', 'Wade', 'film', 'ending', 'little', 'gratuitously', 'violent', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'complained', '.It', 'not', 'everybody', 'lot', 'people', 'critics', 'have', ""n't"", 'liked', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'once', 'again', 'amazing', 'actor', 'lot', 'range', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'played', 'character', 'least', 'twice', 'Thirteen', 'Pretty', 'Persuasion', 'only', 'difference', 'character', 'other', 'two', 'Tobe', 'rebellious', 'nice', 'girl', 'overall', 'scenes', 'Wood', 'Culkin', 'are', 'very', 'true', 'lot', 'scenes', 'were', 'inspired', 'Jacobson', 'childhood', 'have', 'theory', 'more', 'people', 'will', 'dislike', 'movie', 'not', 'big', 'step', 'forward', 'Jacobson', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'enough', 'how', 'good', 'really', 'haunting', 'will', 'stay', 'liked', 'not', 'really', 'well', 'done.FACTORING', 'IN', 'ALL', 'THE', 'FLAWS', 'BGRADE', 'A-']",Down in the Valley
1002165,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,B000GDH9NM,K. Boullosa,"[3, 3]","This small film stuck with me after one viewing, mostly due to Edward Norton's touching and subtle performance.  He portrays Harlan Carruthers, a drifter who inhabits the persona of a South Dakota cowboy working in the San Fernando Valley.  For a good part of the movie, the viewer is not sure how much of that persona is fantasy, and how much is fact - but the thing is, Harlan isn't sure, either, and that lends his character its sad charm.  While working at a gas station he meets October (""Tobe"") a sexually forward but emotionally adrift 17-year-old (Evan Rachel Wood), and her 13-year-old brother, Lonnie, nicely played by Rory Culkin (who gave such a lovely performance as Mel Gibson's son in M. Knight Shmaylan's ""Signs"").  Tobe and Lonnie are spending an aimless summer hanging out in the cultural desert of the smog-ridden San Fernando Valley.  They have no mother, and are being raised by one Wade, played by the often underrated David Morse.  Wade works in the correctional system, and leaves the two children to their own devices much of the time, seesawing back and forth between neglect and overprotectiveness.  Wade is not Lonnie's biological father, and it is unclear whether he is Tobe's biological father, and how he came to be the children's only parent - this unresolved issue is about the only narrative flaw in the film.When Harlan and Tobe meet at the gas station, she immediately senses something ""different"" about him and invites him to go to the beach with her and her friends.  A romance quickly develops, although Harlan is clearly a good bit older than Tobe.  Harlan presents, initially, a gentle and philosophically evolved persona that entrances not only Tobe, but the attention-starved Lonnie as well.  As the film progresses, and Wade's disapproval of the relationship exerts pressure on Harlan and the two youngsters,  Harlan's quirky but sweet aura begins to reveal darker dimensions.  For a long time, the viewer is uncertain whether Harlan is what he seems, and if he is not, how much of his pretense represents a danger to Tobe and Lonnie.  Norton does an exceptional job of pacing the small shifts that begin to change the viewer's perception of Harlan.Eventually, the divide between fact and fantasy that Harlan's presence in their lives uncovers forces Tobe and Lonnie to come to grips with harsh realities, pain, and loss.  They mature through the experience, but part of their maturing is a curious understanding at the last that what Harlan at first offered was valuable and worth wanting, even though it was offered under false pretences.  It is clear at the end that the adults do not share the youngsters' understanding of this, and that the experience, although it has on some level justified the adults' judgment, widens rathar than narrows the gap between them and the children.This is a poignant story, well written and well played, and is absolutely worth your time.",3,"Sad, Endearing Film",1201132800,"01 24, 2008",2008,2919,"['small', 'film', 'stuck', 'one', 'viewing', 'mostly', 'due', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'touching', 'subtle', 'performance', 'Harlan', 'Carruthers', 'drifter', 'who', 'persona', 'South', 'Dakota', 'cowboy', 'working', 'San', 'Fernando', 'Valley', 'good', 'part', 'movie', 'viewer', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'persona', 'fantasy', 'how', 'much', 'fact', 'thing', 'Harlan', ""n't"", 'sure', 'either', 'character', 'sad', 'charm', 'working', 'gas', 'station', 'October', 'Tobe', 'sexually', 'forward', 'emotionally', 'adrift', '17-year-old', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', '13-year-old', 'brother', 'Lonnie', 'nicely', 'played', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'who', 'gave', 'lovely', 'performance', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'son', 'M.', 'Knight', 'Shmaylan', 'Signs', 'Tobe', 'Lonnie', 'are', 'spending', 'aimless', 'summer', 'hanging', 'out', 'cultural', 'desert', 'smog-ridden', 'San', 'Fernando', 'Valley', 'have', 'mother', 'are', 'being', 'raised', 'one', 'Wade', 'played', 'often', 'underrated', 'David', 'Morse', 'Wade', 'correctional', 'system', 'two', 'children', 'own', 'devices', 'much', 'time', 'seesawing', 'back', 'forth', 'neglect', 'overprotectiveness', 'Wade', 'not', 'Lonnie', 'biological', 'father', 'unclear', 'Tobe', 'biological', 'father', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'children', 'only', 'parent', 'unresolved', 'issue', 'only', 'narrative', 'flaw', 'film.When', 'Harlan', 'Tobe', 'meet', 'gas', 'station', 'immediately', 'something', 'different', 'go', 'beach', 'friends', 'romance', 'quickly', 'Harlan', 'clearly', 'good', 'bit', 'older', 'Tobe', 'Harlan', 'initially', 'gentle', 'philosophically', 'evolved', 'persona', 'not', 'only', 'Tobe', 'attention-starved', 'Lonnie', 'well', 'film', 'Wade', 'disapproval', 'relationship', 'pressure', 'Harlan', 'two', 'youngsters', 'Harlan', 'quirky', 'sweet', 'aura', 'reveal', 'darker', 'dimensions', 'long', 'time', 'viewer', 'uncertain', 'Harlan', 'what', 'not', 'how', 'much', 'pretense', 'danger', 'Tobe', 'Lonnie', 'Norton', 'exceptional', 'job', 'pacing', 'small', 'shifts', 'begin', 'change', 'viewer', 'perception', 'Harlan.Eventually', 'divide', 'fact', 'fantasy', 'Harlan', 'presence', 'lives', 'uncovers', 'forces', 'Tobe', 'Lonnie', 'come', 'grips', 'harsh', 'realities', 'pain', 'loss', 'mature', 'experience', 'part', 'maturing', 'curious', 'understanding', 'last', 'what', 'Harlan', 'first', 'offered', 'was', 'valuable', 'worth', 'wanting', 'even', 'was', 'offered', 'false', 'pretences', 'clear', 'end', 'adults', 'do', 'not', 'share', 'youngsters', 'understanding', 'experience', 'level', 'justified', 'adults', 'judgment', 'rathar', 'gap', 'children.This', 'poignant', 'story', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'played', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'time']",Down in the Valley

The protaganist is a self-deluded drifter, played by Edward Norton to perfection.  Norton's every moment on screen is testament to the infinitely small nuances that a master actor can bring to a challenging role such as this.The next-best performance in this film belongs to Rory Culkin as 13 year-old Lonnie.  Much of Lonnie's dialogue consists of saying ""yes"" or ""no"" to questions put to him by the other characters.  Uttering dialogue that is so one-dimensional while creating a character that is fascinating to watch is a high achievement of the actor's craft.  Culkin's unvarnished simplicity in playing this role is a genuine delight.Evan Rachel Wood is sad and beautiful as Norton's love interest.  David Morse is aflame with inner turmoil and outward rampages of anger as Wood's father.  Both actors give the viewer everything that we need to care about their characters and to follow them with profound interest as the story unfolds.There are some problems with the plot, especially toward the end.  The story eventually leads us to a mythos-heavy fairytale landscape where the Old West brutally collides with the New.  But it's always compelling to watch.

1002168,A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK,B000GDH9NM,"Kurt Harding ""bon vivant""","[1, 1]","When reading the raft of reviews posted here for Down In the Valley it becomes obvious that some reviewers were expecting the film to be something it was never meant to be. Despite protagonist Harlan Carruthers' ""cowboy"" pretensions, it is not a western nor is it just another movie about a middle-class girl who finds love on the wrong side of the tracks. What it becomes when one looks beyond the outward story of forbidden romance and teen angst is an allegory of sorts about how what society regards as progress relentlessly changes the world we live in and our relationship to it for better or worse. The juxtaposition toward the end between the freedom of riding through idyllic rolling pastureland then suddenly being confronted by the creeping sprawl of a ticky-tack housing development under construction speaks volumes. Kind of like a real cowboy finding himself trapped in a box canyon, I'd say.Wade, the father, early on had the cowboy Harlan down pat as a loser who was trying to be somebody and was just using the cowboy shtick to attract attention to himself. But in case you think the ""cowboy in LA"" act is too outlandish to be realistic, let me mention that when I was a kid in San Diego who spent a lot of time at the beach there was one long-haired hanger-on who called himself ""Country"" who met with considerable romantic success using his hillbilly act on the local beach bunnies. One more empirical proof that opposites often attract.One reviewer criticized the father as an overbearing alpha male. Well, what father wants his teenage daughter to hang out with a ne'er-do-well twice her age? Harlan's phony act was patently obvious to adults, but to a couple of kids who felt trapped in a numbingly boring suburbia, he seemed a romantic relic of a bygone age.Overall, the acting is strong though the story wobbles at times. Edward Norton is excellent as Harlan the wannabe and increasingly delusional  cowboy. His laconic and sleepy-eyed movements often remind the viewer of Robert Mitchum. I like David Morse as Tobe and Lonnie's father, a single parent trying to juggle his need to be a provider with his equal need to guide and be solicitous of the welfare of two rather ungrateful children. When Harlan comes sniffing around, Wade is naturally protective of his kids especially when Harlan shows a lack of respect for his rules vis-a-vis his home and family. In addition, I enjoyed Evan Rachel Wood's very realistic portrayal of a bored and rebellious teenager trying to figure out her place in the world.While parts of the film may seem unrealistic, there is a lot of hidden meaning ready to be discovered for those willing to think. Down In the Valley is certainly no masterpiece, but its no dud either.",4,"An Allegory, Of Sorts",1197590400,"12 14, 2007",2007,2731,"['When', 'reading', 'raft', 'reviews', 'posted', 'here', 'Down', 'Valley', 'obvious', 'reviewers', 'were', 'expecting', 'film', 'be', 'something', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'protagonist', 'Harlan', 'Carruthers', 'cowboy', 'pretensions', 'not', 'western', 'just', 'movie', 'middle-class', 'girl', 'who', 'love', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'What', 'when', 'one', 'outward', 'story', 'forbidden', 'romance', 'teen', 'angst', 'allegory', 'sorts', 'how', 'what', 'society', 'regards', 'progress', 'relentlessly', 'world', 'live', 'relationship', 'better', 'worse', 'juxtaposition', 'end', 'freedom', 'riding', 'idyllic', 'rolling', 'pastureland', 'then', 'suddenly', 'being', 'confronted', 'creeping', 'sprawl', 'ticky-tack', 'housing', 'development', 'construction', 'speaks', 'volumes', 'Kind', 'real', 'cowboy', 'finding', 'trapped', 'box', 'canyon', ""'d"", 'say.Wade', 'father', 'early', 'had', 'cowboy', 'Harlan', 'down', 'pat', 'loser', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'somebody', 'was', 'just', 'using', 'cowboy', 'shtick', 'attract', 'attention', 'case', 'think', 'cowboy', 'LA', 'act', 'too', 'outlandish', 'be', 'realistic', 'let', 'mention', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'San', 'Diego', 'who', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'beach', 'was', 'one', 'long-haired', 'hanger-on', 'who', 'called', 'Country', 'who', 'met', 'considerable', 'romantic', 'success', 'using', 'hillbilly', 'act', 'local', 'beach', 'bunnies', 'One', 'more', 'empirical', 'proof', 'often', 'attract.One', 'reviewer', 'criticized', 'father', 'overbearing', 'alpha', 'male', 'Well', 'what', 'father', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'hang', 'out', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'twice', 'age', 'Harlan', 'phony', 'act', 'was', 'patently', 'obvious', 'adults', 'couple', 'kids', 'who', 'felt', 'trapped', 'numbingly', 'boring', 'suburbia', 'seemed', 'romantic', 'relic', 'bygone', 'age.Overall', 'acting', 'strong', 'story', 'wobbles', 'times', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'excellent', 'Harlan', 'wannabe', 'increasingly', 'delusional', 'cowboy', 'laconic', 'sleepy-eyed', 'movements', 'often', 'remind', 'viewer', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'like', 'David', 'Morse', 'Tobe', 'Lonnie', 'father', 'single', 'parent', 'trying', 'juggle', 'need', 'be', 'provider', 'equal', 'need', 'guide', 'be', 'solicitous', 'welfare', 'two', 'rather', 'ungrateful', 'children', 'When', 'Harlan', 'sniffing', 'around', 'Wade', 'naturally', 'protective', 'kids', 'especially', 'when', 'Harlan', 'lack', 'respect', 'rules', 'vis-a-vis', 'home', 'family', 'addition', 'enjoyed', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'very', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'bored', 'rebellious', 'teenager', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'place', 'world.While', 'parts', 'film', 'may', 'seem', 'unrealistic', 'lot', 'hidden', 'meaning', 'ready', 'be', 'discovered', 'willing', 'think', 'Down', 'Valley', 'certainly', 'masterpiece', 'dud', 'either']",Down in the Valley
1002169,A2T049UQONS0OY,B000GDH9NM,Larry VanDeSande,"[10, 12]","Edward Norton plays an evil drifter in ""Down In the Valley"", a low-budget flick he made between big budget movies in 2005. He meets and woos 16-year-old Evan Rachel Wood, daughter of his foil, David Morse, and brother to Rory Culkin, whom Norton also turns toward him with his easygoing, hayseed charm.What is most recommendable in this film is Norton's outstanding caricature of a South Dakotan using his enigmatic charms to entrance Los Angelite Wood and her brother against the wishes of their lawman dad, Morse. Bruce Dern has a small role as someone trying to unmask Norton's evil character.As always, Norton is riveting in the understatement with which he carries out his role. You want to accept his explanation that he's a misunderstood well-meaning guy against Morse's admonition that ""I've seen your type before."" Morse plays the good guy opposite the evil star, although he really isn't that much of a good guy. Abusive with both kids, Morse plays a lawman that uses his position to dissaude Norton from sticking around his daughter. This precedes a somewhat predicatable scene where the film both unravels and begins, finally!, to get interesting.I say finally! because this movie is about as slow as maple syrup in February for 75 minutes. It crawls around with little forward motion in a sequence of scenes that define the characters and build the apocalypse that occurs after 75 minutes, when the movie seems to take off.Still, this is required viewing for fans of any of the principal actors, all of whom are well-cast and carry out their roles well. Morse played another good guy foil to a bad guy star in the outstanidng 2001 movie, ""The Indian Runner"". If you like this movie, buy, rent or borrow the other one.

The entire cast turns in stellar performances and Evan Rachel Wood is just a beautiful as ever though I think she was better in The King of California.  There's a good cautionary tale here, the directing and cinematography are top notch.  Why only four stars?Well, Down in the Valley does take a while to find its footing. You just know that the relationship that starts off rather innocently is going to morph into tragedy - and it does.  Of course it does but it takes a while to get the momentum going.  This was another of those films where I wondered about 15 minutes in whether it was going to really reach out and grab my attention.  Not to worry, eventually it does just that but it does take its time getting there.  There is also one setting where Harlan and his friend Twig wake up inside one of those old western towns that like ""Old Tucson"" that are out there today for the purposes of shooting western movies and touristy reenactments of gunfights.  That's a bit too much of a coincidence for me.  I have to wonder whether that setting is in the book... There is a book isn't there?I can't say too much about the story or characters without spoiling the viewing experience.  I will say there are some scenes with Harlan (Norton) where I immediately made both visual and psychological ties to James Dean in Giant.In a nutshell, this film is all about whether someone is really who they seem to be.  It keeps you wondering about who's the good guy and who's the bad guy here?  Even when you finally gets something of a final answer to that question you are still left without complete closure (deliberately) because there are many admirable traits despite the character's overall failure as a human being.One small caution for animal lovers, there is a seen with a frightened horse trapped in a garage that some may find  distressing.

However the author of the film's script admits to being a lifelong film buff. And I think he unwittingly re-wrote ""Taxi Driver"" when he composed this material.This movie follows the same general arc as ""Taxi Driver."" It pursues the same general theme of a man trapped on the fringes of society, with no one to invest his love in, with nowhere to go but into an increasingly elaborated fantasy in which he features himself as heroic rescuer of a lady in distress. But instead of weaving his fantasy out of the cloth of New York's mean streets, the hero of ""Down in the Valley"" casts himself as a cowboy in the Old West. His joust with the world takes the form of a perpetual shoot-out, a perpetual need to get the drop on his opponents.The parallel between the two movies extends even to the heroes' rehearsing their respective challenges to the world in front of a mirror. Only instead of building muscle and asking, ""You talkin' to me?"" - this hero practices his draw and commands, ""Reach `em high!""This duplication of a classic movie isn't a bad thing. There is room for another take on ""Taxi Driver."" Edward Norton is a sweeter, gentler Travis Bickle, although we early get the same intimations of his capacity to become dangerous.This movie is also somewhat more realistic than ""Taxi."" Edward Norton's character similarly meets circumstances in his surroundings that feed into his fantasy. At one point, he finds himself in a wild west setting built for a movie shoot. It's a coincidence, but it's a little more likely than the over-the-top brothel combat in which Robert de Niro gets to live out his dream. And although Edward Norton's fantasy also absorbs him and becomes a mythic re-enactment, it's still a development that could conceivably take place in California's San Fernando Valley where this movie is set. You won't be left wondering, endlessly debating whether or not the conclusion is meant as a dream sequence.But as with almost all of Edward Norton's films, his performance is the main reason to watch and praise the movie.

He takes up with Evan Rachel Wood as October, or Tobe, and there is the proverbial clash with Tobe's dad, played by David Morse.  Morse has quite a gun collection, and as we all know, a gun seen in the first act of a play will make a reappearance in the third act.Edward Norton's acting seems to be in about 2nd or 3rd gear, just cruising along as Harlan, his laconic drawl spinning tales from back on the ranch.  He lulls us into his character, and even when things get nasty, he remains understated, and never gets to the throbbing-vein stage, or starts screaming.  The film takes its own leisurely time to develop, there is plenty of love story, and an appearance by yet another of the vast array of Culkins, this one is named Rory, and they are all highly capable in that kid role.  As things finally begin to unravel, Ed Norton displays some pretty mean drawin' and shootin' skills, and he doesn't look too bad up on a horse, neither. It has been a good year for the Western; ""The Proposition,"" ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada,"" and now ""Down in the Valley.""

Evan Rachel Wood gives a mind blowing performance as the rebellious teen who clashes with her domineering father who lacks an emotional connection to his daughter. The scene where Harlan (Edward Norton) and Tobe (Wood) first lock eyes is brilliantly filmed.  Through the back windshield of her friend's auto, Tobe seductively gazes at Harlan who is filling the car with gas. The camera moves back and forth from Harlan's innocent, naive face to Tobe's angelic face.  From their first ""date"" at the beach, the two characters become romanticaly involved.  For Tobe it is a temporary escape from a shallow existance as a high school girl who doesn't seem to be headed for college, nor a promising career.  She is trapped in a low middle class home where her father ( David Morse) works as a night-time correction officer unaware that his role as a father is much more than just a financial provider.  The tension between Tobe and her father are captured well on screen.  Wood gives all she has in the role of Tobe.  I am glad that there are still some actresses in filmland that can deliver in a role so demanding as this one. Angeline Jolie is not half the actress that Wood is.  I hope that Wood is offered more roles to showcase her talents.  Edward Norton gives another thought provoking performance as the delusional Harlan; a character only an actor like Norton can make memorable.  What makes the film a just miss in the ""indie classic vien"" is the last 45 minutes or so, when Harlan's delusional world becomes unraveled.

Although the story centers around the relationship between Harlan (Edward Norton) and (Tobe) Evan Rachel Wood, several other relationships come sharply into play. The family dynamic between Tobe, her younger brother Lonnie (Rory Culkin), and her father (David Morse), and the relationship that Harlan develops with Lonnie.This film offers a realistic, if odd portrayal of life. Harlan likes to think of himself as a cowpoke, making his way from ranch to ranch, when actually he's stuck in the suburbs of San Fernando Valley working as a gas station attendant. Tobe is an angry teenager who meets and falls in love with the older Harlan, against her father's wishes.What results is a beautiful, sometimes almost corny, film about relationships, reality, fantasy, and how thin the line between good and bad can sometimes be. If you like independent films that actually deliver, theis is the one for you.
