She directed the film and co-wrote its script with sister Karen. It's a multi-layered, mournful ensemble piece that explores the fleeting or elusive nature of happiness.In separate stories, two previously optimistic people become the opposite after a tragic street encounter, a physics professor's wife divorces him when he has an affair, and an embittered insurance company exec has any number of reasons to be profoundly miserable. Other plotlines emanate from and connect to these. Worth seeing but don't expect any smiles.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(7.1) Thirteen Conversations About One Thing (2001) - Alan Arkin/Matthew McConaughey/John Turturro/Amy Irving/Walt MacPherson",4,"""People spend years developing their minds and educating themselves, but in the end, they just want to shut them off.""",1299628800,"03 9, 2011",2011,839,"['Jill', 'Sprecher', 'got', 'idea', 'THIRTEEN', 'CONVERSATIONS', 'ABOUT', 'ONE', 'THING', 'sustaining', 'couple', 'head', 'injuries', 'directed', 'film', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'sister', 'Karen', 'multi-layered', 'mournful', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'fleeting', 'elusive', 'nature', 'happiness.In', 'separate', 'stories', 'two', 'previously', 'optimistic', 'people', 'become', 'opposite', 'tragic', 'street', 'encounter', 'physics', 'professor', 'wife', 'when', 'affair', 'embittered', 'insurance', 'company', 'exec', 'number', 'reasons', 'be', 'profoundly', 'miserable', 'Other', 'plotlines', 'emanate', 'connect', 'Worth', 'seeing', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'smiles.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'imdb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '7.1', 'Thirteen', 'Conversations', 'One', 'Thing', '2001', 'Alan', 'Arkin/Matthew', 'McConaughey/John', 'Turturro/Amy', 'Irving/Walt', 'MacPherson']",N/A

Acting was superb by ALL of the actors -- both known and not so well-known. Loved the exclusion of nudity, violence and special effects in telling this wonderful story. Still very compelling. The movie is done beautifully and is a simplistic work of art in acting, cinematography, and musical score, etc. Thank you to the more well-known actors for contributing your time to these kinds of movies, lending your names to pull in the funding needed to keep creating these wonderful tales. Thank you John Turturro (totally fascinating in this role!), Matthew McConaughey (brilliant and cute), Alan Arkin (loveable), and Amy Irving (classic).

These questions are put to the movie-goer as director Jill Sprecher (CLOCKWATHERS, 1997 ) dumps us into the lives of four people: an insurance actuary played brilliantly by Alan Arkin, an attorney played by current film heart-throb Matthew McConaughey, a struggling housekeeper played by Clea Duvall, and a college teacher having an affair played by John Turturro).The film's premise is a promising one. And you might think that a film exploring happiness would be uplifting. This film is not that. Happiness is sometimes confrontational, sometimes life-altering, sometimes unattainable, and sometimes not what we think it is.In the vein of LOVE ACTUALLY, this movie jumps us between the four sets of lives and ties them all together in a societal quagmire of misunderstanding, loss, acceptance, and the caring we are all capable of giving one another (this is pulled off quite well by Alan Arkin as he helps out a former employee whom he had to fire).While LOVE ACTUALLY pulled the stories together nicely and left the audience with a satisfactory conclusion, 13 CONVERSATIONS does not. The open-endedness of this movie will bother many people (I know it bugged me quite a bit), but it also gives a realistic look at the emotional weight we all carry around with us everyday; it's always mutating, and there's really no end to happiness' changes. It just goes on and on and on. So 13 CONVERSATIONS doesn't give any kind of closure either. And although I can see this as a strength of the film (i.e., leaning toward reality), many movie watchers don't go and see films for that. They want to be transported to the unreal and be snuggly planted in that fairytale aspect of stories.So if you don't mind an open-ended film and like real-life aspects put on the screen, you'll probably love this movie.

It's the kind of film that makes you want to apply some of its ideas and themes to your own life and experiences.At first I was worried.  When the film began, I thought it was going to be an episodic experimental piece, with 13 different scenes each dealing with an aspect of happiness.  This bothered me, because the first segment of the film left me wanting more of the same story and I would have been disappointed if the screenplay had never come back to it.  However, the first few segments that seem at first to be unrelated begin to mesh in a fluid way (but never in a way that feels forced), and what happens in one begins to illuminate the actions and feelings in another.Because of it's episodic nature, the actors don't get a lot of room to flesh out their characters, but the performances are still strong.

(Nor do the writers, Karen and Jill Sprecher, give us any clues in the commentary they--and film editor Stephen Mirionne--provide for the DVD.) A number of themes, however, seem to nominate themselves for this position: Happiness, luck, the power of human will, guilt, acceptance of failure, cause and effect, human interconnectedness, and the value of small gestures, to name a few.The stories that make up this film are presented as a prologue followed by twelve distinct scenes (intertitled with names like, ""Ignorance is bliss,"" ""I once knew a happy man. His happiness was his curse,"" ""Fortune smiles at some and laughs at others,""  and ""18 inches of personal space."" The filmmakers reveal a number of their sources in their commentary (John Stuart Mill and Soren Kierkegaard, for example), but I can't help thinking that their dominant influence were characters from the Bible and the history of the church. All of the Sprechers' characters fall somewhere on the continuum of faith and it is to their credit that they can take profound religious insights and graft them onto everyday human experiences without slipping into the easy sentimentality of religious-themed shows like ""Touched by an Angel."" Alan Arkin's insurance company manager seems to suffer Job-like as a divorced man with a heroin-addicted son who resists his father's help, while also taking on Satan/God-like qualities when he chooses to fire an employee simply because that employee is happy. (""I'm going to take away everything,"" he says. ""The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away."") Clea Duvall, a young woman who works as a maid, has the quiet but certain faith of a modest saint. She has survived a couple of close calls with death (she even states at one point, ""I was saved for a reason""), only to go into a deep depression and crisis of faith when she realizes that one of her clients, a young architect she had a crush on, believs she had stolen an expesive watch when cleaning his apartment. Matthew McConaughey is a cocky district attorney who takes pride in his ability to dispense justice, only to become aware of his own cowardice and guilt. His response is to fall into a swoon of self-mortification worthy of any of a number of medieval martyr saints. John Tuturro is a recently mugged, highly routinized college physics professor who has an adulterous affair with another professor. Athough he claims his mid-week dalliance is evidence that his life is not predictable, he tells his mistress to meet him again the following week at the same place and time. The richness of the performances given by these actors, as well as by the rest of the cast, go a long way to making the story unfold long after you finish watching the movie.

Director Jill Sprecher walks a thin line and teases out the tension between two world views. On the one hand, these characters feel the apparent futility and despair that despite what choices they make, or wish they could make, they really have no control over their lives, and so life feels very random and fickle. Still, as the film has it, the lives of these four characters do in fact intersect, such that a bigger picture of purpose is intimated. Clearly, all the characters in this film long to embrace the notion that there is a larger, benign Purpose directing what appear to be little more than accidental events. In a final scene, even the mere gesture of waving to someone as the subway train pulls away suggests that there is meaning in all we do. Christians will enjoy this film as an excellent commentary on the notion of divine Providence in which a loving God superintends our lives.

Is it by fate, Dame Fortune, or is it something we have to discover for ourselves?  That's the thing in 13 Conversations About One Thing.  There are various phrases that separate each segment of the movie, such as &quot;fortune smiles on some, fortune laughs on others,&quot; which help underline the theme of this movie, as experienced by many characters.There's an actuary, Gene English (Alan Arkin), whose company is going through hard times, and in order to cut back, lets go of Wade, an employee who's always happy and has a smile on his face.  His motive that Wade will find some sort of silver lining.  And Wade is at first shocked, as he has a family to support.  Through this act, we learn more about Gene.  He does have problems of his own, as he has a drug-addicted son, and is no longer married.  I kind detected a kind of spite in Gene when he fired Wade, the typical case of an unhappy person who can't stand someone being happy.  But given the outcomes of both people, it makes one wonder if karma has a role to play in this.The physics professor Walker (John Turturro) is a creature of routine, making his entire life a schedule, whether it be his lover or his office hours, as he makes clear to one student who isn't making an effort in his class and whom he has a certain dislike.  He's even left his wife to have an affair in the hopes that some kind of novel stimulation will break him away from the cozy rut of his old life.  To him, that's happiness.  Yet old habits die hard.  He also finds solace in certainty, as his teaching physics irreversible.  But in one instant, the effects that we have in what we say to one person is demonstrated later on.  Or do, in the case of the actuary.A hotshot prosecutor (Matthew McConaughey) is celebrating a victory in a case, but on his way back, he accidentally hits a young girl and leaves her there, not wanting to undergo legal entanglements--he oughta know, he's a lawyer.  Slowly, the guilt he feels affects his life.  The girl herself, Beatrice, (Clea DuVall), a housecleaner, initially has a positive outlook on life, yet following her accident, she becomes disillusioned.There are some techniques used a la He Loves Me He Loves Me Not or Happenstance, where things that are seen in later segments fill in gaps or connect previously seen segments.  And the performances are great throughout, even one can't sympathize with some of the characters, i.e. the lawyer.  Me, I'll take as Wade as my nominee.The viewer is indeed limited in the characters' lives via the film, but it does make one wonder, what happened afterward to them?  Do or will they ever find that pot at the end of the rainbow?

I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and when I went to bed in the evening, I was still thinking about it.  For me, this is really the true measure of a film: did it affect me?  Did I leave the screen changed in some way (and not just $9.00 poorer).This film explores ""happiness"" and, to a large extent, the haphazard nature of life.  Small events have large consequences in this film.  We are constantly watching the unforeseen pop up surprisingly.  The time in the film is altered, scenes are out of order, etc.  The effect of this is to render, in a way, the unpredictable nature of life somewhat...well...predictable.  Despite the fact that little moments impact our lives on a deep level, by watching things in reverse, we naturally project a sense of purpose and destiny on our lives.The acting in this film is terrific.  I was particularly impressed with Alan Arkin.  Who is this guy?  I'm going to have to find out, because his performance is superb in this film and I can't imagine that he just popped up overnight.  Alan steals every scene he is in and he wears his character like an old suit.  It hardly seems like acting at all.People are so cruel in this film.  Then they do nice things.  And then they're cruel again.  It's enough to make you dizzy, but that's life.  I can't wait to see what director Jill Sprecher comes up with next.  It will surely be a treat to watch and another film that makes us think.  My recommendation: give 13 CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ONE THING a try.

It stars Alan Arkin, Clea DuVall, Matthew McConaughey John Turturro, and Oscar nominee Amy Irving (&quot;Yentl&quot;).  It desplicts four separate storylines that have one thing in common: they struggle with happiness.  One loses his money shortly after winning the lottery, one struggles to keep herself together after an accident, the guy who ran her over struggles with guilt, one struggles with catching her husband cheating, and one whose envy threatens becomes self-destructible.  The powerful theme within the events is present in every scene.  Their life struggles have the intensity to keep audiences watching closely.  The complex stories detail so deeply that audiences must watch the film multiple times to fully understand them.  Though some questions have yet to be answered, they will be glad afterwards.  Despite the time frames moving back and forth, the plot doesn't lose its touch with the chain of events.  In fact, it keeps everything more interesting.  The emotional theme is accented by the actors who perform their roles wonderful and expressively, especially Arkin.

Good movies should make you think, and the subject matter of this movie is particularly relevant because actually thinking about happiness (instead of just running) is something we should be doing much more often in our lives anyway.But of course this is such a complex issue that no movie can really but scratch the surface.

she was the character i cared for the most, and i found my heart breaking for her at times. matthew mcconaughey gives the best performance of his career as a tormented young prosecutor who, due to a tragic event, finds that he cannot live up to the moral standards that he has been so effortlessly imposing upon others. and alan arkin is brilliant as usual in perhaps the most challenging role of the film, which is that of a bitter working stiff who is convinced that because happiness has evaded him for so much of his life, it is, by its very nature, something that is impossible to actually achieve; it simply falls upon some and eludes others.and that is precisely what this film, for me, was about: the elusive nature of happiness. and not just its elusive nature, but its undefinable nature as well; for what is happiness to one is not necessarily happiness to another. this is what alan arkin's character in the film has difficulty coming to terms with. he views the chronically happy state of his office underling with nothing but contempt, and he describes this man as an ""underachiever"" for finding happiness in what he perceives to be mediocrity and the banal.but what sprecher reveals to us through the course of this film is that happiness cannot be quantitatively and qualitatively measured and predicted as john turturro's character, a physics professor, attempts to do. there is simply no formula for success. it is not just about changing your lifestyle and escaping the drudgery of daily routine, or achieving greater worldly possessions and higher job status. indeed, by the end, sprecher manages to convince us that happiness can come with something as slight as a wave from a stranger in a subway station, or the flash of a smile from across a city street.",4,smiles and cries,1022544000,"05 28, 2002",2002,2647,"['what', 'find', 'most', 'admirable', 'jill', 'sprecher', 'second', 'film', 'co-writer', 'karen', 'sprecher', 'have', 'written', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'movie', 'versions', 'real', 'human', 'beings', 'seem', 'be', 'real', 'thing', 'film', 'beautifully', 'structured', 'way', 'are', 'allowed', 'weave', 'various', 'characters', 'lives', 'time', 'frames', 'feeling', 'are', 'being', 'shortchanged', 'area', 'character', 'development', 'case', 'most', 'ensemble', 'pieces', 'bombard', 'stylistic', 'cinematic', 'flourishes', 'conceal', 'hackneyed', 'characters', '.sprecher', 'also', 'be', 'actor', 'director', 'able', 'cull', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'cast', 'clea', 'duvall', 'almost', 'unearthly', 'grace', 'can', 'project', 'staggering', 'vulnerability', 'too', 'human', 'fragility', 'when', 'character', 'faced', 'life', 'cruel', 'dealings', 'was', 'character', 'i', 'cared', 'most', 'i', 'found', 'heart', 'breaking', 'times', 'matthew', 'mcconaughey', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'tormented', 'young', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'due', 'tragic', 'event', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'moral', 'standards', 'been', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'imposing', 'others', 'alan', 'arkin', 'brilliant', 'usual', 'perhaps', 'most', 'challenging', 'role', 'film', 'bitter', 'working', 'stiff', 'who', 'convinced', 'happiness', 'evaded', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'very', 'nature', 'something', 'impossible', 'actually', 'achieve', 'simply', 'eludes', 'others.and', 'precisely', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'elusive', 'nature', 'happiness', 'not', 'just', 'elusive', 'nature', 'undefinable', 'nature', 'well', 'what', 'happiness', 'one', 'not', 'necessarily', 'happiness', 'what', 'alan', 'arkin', 'character', 'film', 'difficulty', 'coming', 'terms', 'chronically', 'happy', 'state', 'office', 'underling', 'nothing', 'contempt', 'man', 'underachiever', 'finding', 'happiness', 'what', 'be', 'mediocrity', 'banal.but', 'what', 'reveals', 'course', 'film', 'happiness', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'quantitatively', 'qualitatively', 'measured', 'predicted', 'john', 'turturro', 'character', 'physics', 'professor', 'attempts', 'do', 'simply', 'formula', 'success', 'not', 'just', 'changing', 'lifestyle', 'escaping', 'drudgery', 'daily', 'routine', 'achieving', 'greater', 'worldly', 'possessions', 'higher', 'job', 'status', 'indeed', 'end', 'sprecher', 'manages', 'convince', 'happiness', 'can', 'come', 'something', 'as', 'slight', 'wave', 'stranger', 'subway', 'station', 'flash', 'smile', 'city', 'street']",N/A

Writers Jill and Karen Sprecher have given us one of the more intelligent, thoughtful, challenging AND entertaining films of the last decade.  No pretenses here, just a micrscopic view of several individuals whose lives intersect and in doing so teach us a lot about fate, about the concept of 'happiness', about the importance of finding the self while not alienating the other 'selves' on the planet.  Jill Sprecher also directs this dream cast with a sensitive eye for Reality that happens to include dreamers as well as pessimists.  In this film are some of the finest performances by such actors as Matthew McConaughey, Clea Duvall, John Turturro, Tia Texada, Amy Irving, Alex Burns, and the always superb Alan Arkin.  The supporting cast is excellent and kudos are due the casting director for assembling such a fine ensemble of actors.  From the opening line (short statements that define each of the sections) this film operates on the assumption that the audience is smart and that assumption is such a relief after the plethora of no-brainers that crowd the theaters.  Not that this is JUST an intellectual exercise (somehow that connotes 'dry' or 'boring' to some readers):  this is a tender, sensitive, honest, plaintive look at how we behave and respond and survive in this melting pot of humanity.

So I've been thinking about the topic of the film quite a lot lately.  The film has no plot but just switches between different characters who are searching for happiness.  The characters include a lawyer who becomes overcome by an unexpected event outside of work, a financial manager who struggles with his son's delinquency, a University professor whose marriage is crumbling and a young woman who is overcome by a mishap but refuses to give up.  Also, there is a man who gets fired from his job after 15 years yet his spirits remain high.  We also are briefly introduced to a college student who's struggling to pass a physics course to get into medical school.These are some of my observations and comments on the content of the film:1) There was a very good and positive portrayal of blacks (i.e. the smart college kid and the financial manager's best friend).2) The people who seem to get the worst end of the deal are often the ones who are better off than those who seem to get the better end of the deal (i.e. the fired employee vs. his boss, the lawyer vs. the young woman who got hit).It is what goes on INSIDE of an individual not the fulfilment of external and material desires and needs which bring people happiness.  Happiness is an inner goal and motive.  This has been said in many ways from different religions and philosophies but most people are not very mindful of it.  It's one of those things which I have to keep reminding myself of as well.",5,Do you want to see a great film?

Superficially it plays the familiar themes of random connections, the smallest casual act leading to consequences, and life's not fair.  But it elevates those near banalities through a spare script, superb acting, tightly shot interior scenes, and -- when outside -- uncommon, but unmistakeable New York shots.  It and its players have meanness, grace, chance, trust, tragedy, hubris, redemption, possibility and -- at its conclusion -- a lot of hope and just desserts in almost all cases.  Alan Arkin as a middle-management sour insurance executive performs perhaps the most surprising of the characters' many turns and Matthew McConaughey has never been more true as an actor than when he turns his assistant district attorney character's view that the guilty must be punished continually on himself.

719855,AGCBE06XCLLM9,B00006L927,john b,"[0, 0]","When I sat down to watch this movie, I didn't know a single thing about it. In fact, the first thing that I did before actually beginning it was to watch the trailer. That gave me a little information, but my experience was still more-or-less clean when I pushed 'play' on the DVD remote. I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised about how much I liked something I had no expectations of.'13 Conversations About 1 Thing' is told in the rotation of several plotlines around a handful of characters that all live in the same general area. While these characters might never meet face to face, their individual lives are all overlapping in ways that are both heartening and sorrowful. Where one character might not be getting what they need (or deserve) another is reaping all the benefits of a life of hedonism. It is a kaleidoscope of interactions, one that the movie's plot takes and gives a slight twist to, putting most things to rights by the end.I think I read on the back cover that the movie was called 'heart-warming' by one reviewer. I would agree with that, but add this cautionary note: this story is told with a lot of silence and space, with little regard for true chronology. The progression is told back-to-forward and then forward-to-back, with no cut and clear indication of where a particular section of story might fit into the whole. There are a lot of inferences to be made about what fits where, and sometimes just when you think you have some point figured out, the movie tosses in one tiny thing that makes you rethink the whole progression to that point. In most movies this might be annoying...but in this one it is indeed the heart-warming aspect; the ways that the movie forces you to re-see the interactions of the characters gives you this warm, fuzzy feeling when you're done with it. There is hope hiding behind the scenes in this movie.My only real complaint about '13 Conversations' was some of the acting. A few of the actors seemed a little lost in the world that they were supposed to be creating, and the acting came off a little flat for it. The cheating husband seemed too stiff; I realize he is a physicist who isn't good with people to begin with, but he must have had some warmth to him if he was able to seduce an English professor (who are known for their passion). The bad DA seemed a little out of place as well; there should have been more emotion to the scenes where he revisited his crimes rather than the atypical 'I'm-going-to-stand-and-stare' that is the fallback in situations where actors and directors can't think of something more clever.I feel like I'm being mean to a well-loved child by making these criticisms, but I want to make sure to get them out there. This is a movie that is worth seeing, one that will leave you feeling a strange warmth in you for many days afterwards, and one that makes you stop to think your way through the haphazard chronology that it presents to you. It is a movie that takes the interactions between strangers who will never meet to a local (and warming) conclusion; this is the movie that Magnolia wished it could have been, but wasn't.Bottom line: rent this one and watch it on a cold winter's night.NL",4,This it the movie that Magnolia wishes it had been,1133222400,"11 29, 2005",2005,3200,"['When', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'single', 'thing', 'fact', 'first', 'thing', 'did', 'actually', 'beginning', 'was', 'watch', 'trailer', 'gave', 'little', 'information', 'experience', 'was', 'still', 'more-or-less', 'clean', 'when', 'pushed', 'DVD', 'remote', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'something', 'had', 'expectations', 'Conversations', '1', 'Thing', 'told', 'rotation', 'several', 'plotlines', 'handful', 'characters', 'live', 'same', 'general', 'area', 'characters', 'might', 'never', 'meet', 'face', 'face', 'individual', 'lives', 'are', 'overlapping', 'ways', 'are', 'heartening', 'sorrowful', 'Where', 'one', 'character', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'getting', 'what', 'need', 'deserve', 'reaping', 'benefits', 'life', 'hedonism', 'kaleidoscope', 'interactions', 'one', 'movie', 'plot', 'slight', 'twist', 'putting', 'most', 'things', 'rights', 'end.I', 'think', 'read', 'back', 'cover', 'movie', 'was', 'called', ""'heart-warming"", 'one', 'reviewer', 'would', 'agree', 'add', 'cautionary', 'note', 'story', 'told', 'lot', 'silence', 'space', 'little', 'regard', 'true', 'chronology', 'progression', 'told', 'back-to-forward', 'then', 'forward-to-back', 'cut', 'clear', 'indication', 'where', 'particular', 'section', 'story', 'might', 'fit', 'whole', 'are', 'lot', 'inferences', 'be', 'made', 'what', 'where', 'sometimes', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'have', 'point', 'figured', 'out', 'movie', 'one', 'tiny', 'thing', 'rethink', 'whole', 'progression', 'point', 'most', 'movies', 'might', 'be', 'annoying', 'one', 'indeed', 'heart-warming', 'aspect', 'ways', 'movie', 'forces', 're-see', 'interactions', 'characters', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'feeling', 'when', ""'re"", 'done', 'hope', 'hiding', 'scenes', 'movie.My', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', ""'13"", 'Conversations', 'was', 'acting', 'few', 'actors', 'seemed', 'little', 'lost', 'world', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'creating', 'acting', 'came', 'off', 'little', 'flat', 'cheating', 'husband', 'seemed', 'too', 'stiff', 'realize', 'physicist', 'who', ""n't"", 'good', 'people', 'begin', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'warmth', 'was', 'able', 'seduce', 'English', 'professor', 'who', 'are', 'known', 'passion', 'bad', 'DA', 'seemed', 'little', 'place', 'well', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'emotion', 'scenes', 'where', 'revisited', 'crimes', 'rather', 'atypical', ""I'm-going-to-stand-and-stare"", 'fallback', 'situations', 'where', 'actors', 'directors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'something', 'more', 'clever.I', 'feel', ""'m"", 'being', 'mean', 'well-loved', 'child', 'making', 'criticisms', 'want', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'out', 'there', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'one', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'strange', 'warmth', 'many', 'days', 'afterwards', 'one', 'stop', 'think', 'way', 'haphazard', 'chronology', 'movie', 'interactions', 'strangers', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'meet', 'local', 'warming', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'Magnolia', 'wished', 'could', 'have', 'been', ""wasn't.Bottom"", 'line', 'rent', 'one', 'watch', 'cold', 'winter', 'night.NL']",N/A

Walker responds--what all people want, happiness.  The story itself is as fragmented as the actual search that many face when they search for this emotional state of joy.  As the audience is initially led through the story via a number of conversations, it seems like these conversations have no relevance to one another.

719860,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00006L927,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[3, 5]","Jill Sprecher, this film's director, previously made Clockwatchers, a witty comedy about office life among temps.  Here the mood is the polar opposite; this is a mostly somber film about the consequences of choices we make in our lives--on ourselves and those we affect--and the consequences of random events upon us all.  The acting is superb.  Alan Arkin in particular is brilliant, although Matthew McConaghey turns in a powerful performance as well (he's also great in another current film, Frailty).  John Turturro is also excellent.As has been increasingly the case since the influential Pulp Fiction appeared on the scene, time manipulation is a primary element in how this film is structured.  While this is used well, the dialogue is much too often stodgy or stagy.  This tends to weaken the impact of what could have been a masterpiece, and considerably slows down the momentum of the film as it progresses.In addition, alienation, suicide and depression figure largely in the proceedings.  With an unrelenting focus on these matters, there needs to be not so much occasional levity to offset this as much as some emphasis on vitality to counterbalance the drag that every character here imposes on himself/herself--or that is imposed upon him/her.  The presence of one jovial office worker, in fact, is an obvious contrivance for this exact reason--to provide the ""happy face"" otherwise invisible.The semi-tinkly music is also a dubious factor here and can occasionally be somewhat annoying.  The message seems to be that life is ultimately depressing, makes us unhappy, and that we will inevitably regret the choices we make since they will cause unhappiness. Including music meant to be an ironic counterpoint--with its light, though minor-keyed tones--has an effect opposite to what was intended: it's just too much, similar to the contrivance of the happy worker.A brisker pace, sharper dialogue, and greater emphasis on how to move ourselves towards hope, towards what we can do to rise above the terrible lows life throws us into, would have helped considerably.  Does this mean the film should have a ""happy"" ending?  Be like all other Hollywood movies?  Not at all.  I salute Ms. Sprecher for the innovative direction she took in this film.  But when we feel that there is no way out, and that feeling is repeated more than a few times, without any letup, it makes for an unrelentingly heavy-handed piece.Intelligence and emotion should always be fused in any great work of art.  The trick is knowing how to fuse them so that we are encouraged in some way by what we experience.",3,An unusually made film,1022889600,"06 1, 2002",2002,2597,"['Jill', 'Sprecher', 'film', 'director', 'previously', 'made', 'Clockwatchers', 'witty', 'comedy', 'office', 'life', 'temps', 'Here', 'mood', 'polar', 'opposite', 'mostly', 'somber', 'film', 'consequences', 'choices', 'make', 'lives', 'ourselves', 'affect', 'consequences', 'random', 'events', 'acting', 'superb', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'particular', 'brilliant', 'Matthew', 'McConaghey', 'powerful', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'great', 'current', 'film', 'Frailty', 'John', 'Turturro', 'also', 'excellent.As', 'been', 'increasingly', 'case', 'influential', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'appeared', 'scene', 'time', 'manipulation', 'primary', 'element', 'how', 'film', 'structured', 'used', 'well', 'dialogue', 'much', 'too', 'often', 'stodgy', 'stagy', 'weaken', 'impact', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'masterpiece', 'considerably', 'down', 'momentum', 'film', 'addition', 'alienation', 'suicide', 'depression', 'figure', 'largely', 'proceedings', 'unrelenting', 'focus', 'matters', 'be', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'occasional', 'levity', 'offset', 'as', 'much', 'emphasis', 'vitality', 'counterbalance', 'drag', 'character', 'here', 'himself/herself', 'imposed', 'him/her', 'presence', 'one', 'jovial', 'office', 'worker', 'fact', 'obvious', 'contrivance', 'exact', 'reason', 'provide', 'happy', 'face', 'otherwise', 'invisible.The', 'semi-tinkly', 'music', 'also', 'dubious', 'factor', 'here', 'can', 'occasionally', 'be', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'message', 'be', 'life', 'ultimately', 'depressing', 'unhappy', 'will', 'inevitably', 'regret', 'choices', 'make', 'will', 'cause', 'unhappiness', 'Including', 'music', 'meant', 'be', 'ironic', 'counterpoint', 'light', 'minor-keyed', 'tones', 'effect', 'opposite', 'what', 'was', 'intended', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'similar', 'contrivance', 'happy', 'worker.A', 'brisker', 'pace', 'sharper', 'dialogue', 'greater', 'emphasis', 'how', 'move', 'towards', 'hope', 'towards', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'rise', 'terrible', 'lows', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'considerably', 'mean', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'Be', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'Not', 'salute', 'Ms.', 'Sprecher', 'innovative', 'direction', 'took', 'film', 'when', 'feel', 'way', 'feeling', 'repeated', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'letup', 'unrelentingly', 'heavy-handed', 'piece.Intelligence', 'emotion', 'should', 'always', 'be', 'fused', 'great', 'work', 'art', 'trick', 'knowing', 'how', 'fuse', 'so', 'are', 'encouraged', 'way', 'what', 'experience']",N/A

And how easily, by just a chance happening, can it be taken away?  There's a huge cast here and at least four intersecting stories set in urban New York on streets I recognize.  It was written and directed by the sister team of Jill and Karen Sprecher and there's an edgy intelligence to the whole thing that stimulated my thinking about my own life.The cast is huge and includes Matthew McConaughy, John Turtoro, Amy Irving, Clea DuVall and Alan Arkin.  They all give outstanding performance and get deeply into their characterizations.  There's a successful attorney who hurts someone in a hit and run accident and tortures himself with regrets.  There's a college professor who hates the routine of his life and thinks that an affair will change things. There's a manager at an insurance company with personal problems who fires an employee just because of the employee's positive outlook on life.  There's the victim of an accident who's a happy person until she's randomly struck down.  There's the wife who has it all but whose marriage has failed.The film is more than a sum total of the stories though.  It's a mood that's set that lingers long after I turned off the DVD.  It's a rather uncomfortable film to watch because it forces us to realize how our moments of happiness depend on random events beyond our control.

The film has similarities to Short Cuts and Magnolia, suggesting that the lives and destinies of seemingly unconnected people may be linked in some fundamental, perhaps even metaphysical way. It also has the nonlinear structure of films like Pulp Fiction. To its credit, 13 Conversations holds its own with all three of these films and is quite original in its approach. The performances are all very strong, especially Alan Arkin as a cynical manager in an insurance agency and Clea Duvall as a house cleaner with a cheerful outlook until catastrophe strikes. Matthew Mcconaughey and John Turturro are also perfectly cast. The plot (or plots) of 13 Conversations is compelling, but is secondary to the questions it raises about finding meaning and happiness in an often harsh and chaotic world.

The written word [print] and film are two entirely different art forms, which, in my opinion, is the basic reason why a book rarely translates easily into a movie. Still, if there is such a thing as a literate movie, this is certainly one of them.Happiness is the subject of the conversations here - how to get it, how to keep it, how to lose it. Several stories connect, interconnect and weave around each other in hypnotic, enigmatic fashion, finally coming to a satisfying conclusion.The Specher sisters see modern urban life as somewhat depressing for most people. It's not the kind of depression that prevents you from getting out of bed. It's the kind brought on by the tediousness and relentlessness of day to day living. All our creature comforts and technological advances have not, the Sprechers seem to believe, done much to make us happier.There are not happy endings for all the memorable characters we meet in the movie, but all of them learn a great deal about the meaning and nature of this elusive emotional state. The best stories are the ones about an attorney [Matthew McConaughey] who only thinks he's happy, an insurance salesman [Alan Arkin] who thinks happiness doesn't exist, and a maid [Clea Duvall] whose innately happy and positive nature is severely threatened. The Sprechers have managed to create characters we can care about, relate to, and almost think of as real.The cast is uniformly excellent.

719866,AIZIFDQJECYXZ,B00006L927,"""memdoc""","[4, 4]","The title of this movie tells it all without saying much.  This movie is about that ineffable, undescribable connection between people.  The seemingly random yet deeply meaningful, and, sometimes life-altering collision which occurs between total strangers daily, is the topic of conversation.  Somehow the paths of peoples' lives intersect and the momentum of one life alters the course of another.  And, like a fundamental law of physics, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  A balance is maintained between tragedy and happiness.  Just what this connection is is never articulated, nor could it ever be articulated.  The closest concept I can think of to describe it is Jung's theory of synchronicity, defined as an acausal connecting principal.  In other words, there is a meaningful interplay of individuals' experiences that influence one another without causing one another.  Another theory is the recently popularized theory of 6 degrees of separation. It suggests that every person is connected to every other person via a maximum of 6 interconnected relationships.  The number of people seems arbitrary but the message is that every individual influences the experiences of other people without having to know them and without having to choose to influence them.  Of course, this could be interpreted as fate.  Or it may be the laws of nature or chemical interaction, or even quantum mechanics.  But, it could also be interpreted as the presence of benevolence and justice in a world defined by free will and individual choices; a method to the madness if you will.The style of the film is necessarily non-linear to reveal to us the topic of conversation.  Linear narrative by default imparts a cause and effect feel, one event leads to the next and so on.  This would be acceptable in a story focusing on an individual character.  But this isn't the story of an individual person.  It is about the topic of conversation.  The connections between people do not occur in a linear fashion nor do they occur in a predictable manner.  Therefore, the narrative structure must be unpredictable and almost tangential.  I believe this was done successfully in this movie.  It has been tried before in other movies but typically with overly dramatic flair.  This movie actually portrays life the way it happens, in an understated yet very powerful manner.  Much of this is due to the superb acting and direction.  I found this movie very enjoyable, and, in the end, uplifting.

Not all the answers to simple or complex questions are the same, as this movie illustrates in a very creative and effective manner.  ""13 Conversations About One Thing"" is a film that examines the daily life of human beings, and just how something so subtle or small can cause a chain reaction of events.The movie revolves around five New Yorkers who end up getting involved with one another's life in some way.  There's the public defender who in a chain of events ends up walking the path of a criminal by covering his tracks.  And then there is the bitter business man who can't stand the fact that one of his workers is always happy no matter what.  There's the confused college professor who fears of not living life to the fullest after being mugged.  There's the happy and enthusiastic cleaning woman who believes miracles happens everyday, but has her worldview drastically changed when she is hospitalized after being hit by a car.  And finally, there's the woman who has to deal with the fact that her husband is cheating on her after having his stolen wallet returned.  All of this is a setup for a sad, and yet moving film about the everyday events that we overlook from time to time.  And how we never really notice even the smallest chain reactions that occur everywhere.This was a great movie to watch and kept my attention throughout.  I do admit that I was confused the first time, being that the movie really isn't told in chronological order, but more set up as little separate stories.  After seeing it a second time it really did help me understand more of what was transpiring.  It always makes me happy to see a film like this that actually makes you think and want to re-evaluate the things you see in life.The cast was sensational.  Alan Arkin was really a joy to watch and I'm sad that he didn't get more recognition.  As he is always good in what he does, this is one of his best roles in recent memory.  Matthew McChonaughey is also terrific and deserves mention.  John Turturro never fails to impress me and I believe he was perfect for his role.  Clea Duvall really makes you sympathize with what has happened to her and you really do hope that her worldview can go back to the way it was.  And last, but not least, Amy Irving really delivers an exceptional performance.  The writing and directing is also very impressive as well.The DVD has a few things to offer; not a lot, but enough to keep me content.  There's a couple of trailers (including the one for the movie itself), and commentary (which I have yet to hear but am anxious to listen to).  The picture and sound quality is really good and does the movie justice.""13 Conversations About One Thing"" is a highly interesting movie that can actually speak to you if you allow it to.  Although it may be confusing at times, it still does more than just simply getting the job done.  It makes us think, it makes us wonder, and it makes us pause in silence.  Of course, this is one not everyone is going to like, but I think the movies that don't appeal to everybody are the ones worth examining.  You'll never know where and when you'll find a gem.  This was a very deep and emotionally charged film, and I am glad I gave it a chance.

There have been plenty of films exploring how people's lives are interconnected, the most recent being Magnolia. But 13 Conversations About One Thing is more tightly woven then many other similar films. We clearly see all these connections and the cause and effect relationships they have, even though the characters never realize how small their world is. The result is a fantastic exploration of fate.But what pushes this film up another notch is how it doesn't stop there and provides another theme: Happiness. Each character is stuck at a point in life coming to terms with their own happiness, or their lack their of. Each character is unique and at a different stage, from finding happiness and suddenly losing it, to having lost it long ago.13 Conversations About One Thing will lead to conversations long after the film, both on happiness and how small the world really is.

719876,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00006L927,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 5]","In ""13 Conversations About One Thing,"" the ""one thing"" that everyone keeps having conversations about is whether or not happiness is possible in a world that seems to be made up of little more than a series of random events haphazardly strung together.  Just as everything seems to be going your way, an unexpected and unforeseen ""event"" may knock you completely off course, thereby depriving you of that ""happiness"" you felt, moments before, lay just within your grasp.  This view of life seems to be rather popular among filmmakers this year, having also been explored in some depth in the sci-fi thriller ""Signs"" this summer.  ""13 Conversations"" takes a more low-keyed approach, providing a series of interlocking vignettes from everyday life that, when pieced together, provide a possible answer to life's ultimate question.Writers Karen and Jill Sprecher (the latter also directed the film) have fashioned a complex narrative involving a number of characters whose paths cross in bizarre and often shocking ways.  In fact, the film is rather unique in that the structure actually BECOMES the theme, as we discover that events that seem random to us - and indeed to the characters - at the outset actually come together to form a meaningful pattern.  As one character says at the end of the film, life really only makes sense when we take the time to look back on it, for it is only from that perspective that we are able to discern the overarching pattern and meaning of it all.All of the many characters in the film are struggling not only to define happiness but to attain a measure of it for themselves in a world in which they are made to feel like mere helpless pawns, blown about by the whims of ""fortune,"" ""luck,"" ""chance,"" ""fate,"" whatever one wants to call the ""power"" that seems to determine the courses our lives end up taking.  Matthew McConaughey plays a handsome and successful public defender who feels that he has achieved happiness in his career only to have it ripped from him when he runs over a young woman at a corner and leaves the scene of the crime.  The woman herself (Clea Duvall), before the accident, is a sincere believer in a higher power that watches over us and guides us along the path it most wants us to take.  Yet, after the accident, she loses that belief, coming instead to see life as a chaotic jumble of chance circumstances, devoid of meaning and purpose.  John Turturro plays a college professor suffering from the classic symptoms of major midlife crisis.  He abandons his wife (Amy Irving), conducts a meaningless affair with a coworker, and finds no relevance or fulfillment in his teaching job or in the students he could be guiding and helping.  As a Physics teacher, he knows that the universe is NOT random, that it does, in fact, operate within a series of finely proscribed natural laws.  Perhaps this is why he is the one character who actually tries to buck ""fate"" and to take proactive measures to change the course of his life.  The problem is that the course change brings him no more satisfaction than did his previous life path.  Perhaps, most fascinating of all is Alan Arkin, a businessman so unhappy with his own life that he takes pleasure in ruining the life of a co-worker who seems somehow to have attained the happiness that has eluded the rest of us.""13 Conversations About One Thing"" is definitely a movie that grows on you.  Like ""Go"" a few years back, the makers of this film respect the intelligence of their audience.  They gather the strands of their story slowly, thereby allowing us to make connections and to eventually come up with the theme on our own.  As the film's director, Jill Sprecher never hurries us along.  In fact, much of the profundity of the screenplay is brought out by the elegiac, lyrical tone she establishes throughout.  The quiet, unhurried pacing of the scenes puts the audience into a reflective state of mind that helps us see beneath the deceptively simple surface of the film's action.McConaughey, Duvall, Turturro and Irving are all outstanding in this film, but it is Arkin who soars in the key role of the disgruntled businessman.  His sad-faced, understated portrayal of a man so caught up in petty bitterness that he will willfully destroy a harmless fellow human being to make himself feel a bit less miserable is shattering in its brilliance.  He has truly never been better.  Ditto for the other actors, for this is a great ensemble cast, even though most of the performers never appear in any scenes together.""13 Conversations About One Thing"" is a film that feels like it has REALLY BEEN THOUGHT OUT ahead of time, not thrown together in haphazard fashion as so many other films appear to be.

In fact, the best scenes in the movie aren't big revelations, dramatic monologues or directorial set pieces, but subtle character moments: a conversation that hits the right note, a glance that suggests a subtext, a smile.The movie refused to leave my head for weeks, an impact disproportionate to the movie's quiet sombre tone.

719883,A22QPZWME85Z8T,B00006L927,"Timothy Hammond ""Movie Geek""","[2, 5]","13 Conversations About One Thing is a film that deals with issues of doubt, faith, envy, happiness, and most of all, the way our lives are affected by even the smallest event in ways that we often cannot fathom.  Obviously, the film is treading upon familiar ground; however, these issues are presented in a fashion that is original enough to avoid any sense of repetitiveness or redundancy.The film presents us with a variety of characters, each dealing with the issues mentioned above in his or her own way.  Towards the end of the film, as the scope slowly broadens and moves from a tight focus on the individual to include a wider canvas in which we can focus on all of the characters at once, the splendidly intricate ripple effect that has taken place between the characters becomes clearer.  The strength of the film lies here, when the viewer can see the big picture and the way in which every decision one makes in life can affect the life of another.The pacing of the film is often deliberately slow and suffocating, which in this case works to achieve the director's goal.  The film itself is paced like real life, underscoring the fact that each action does not always elicit an immediate reaction.  In reality, only time will tell when that ripple effect has reached it's end, and only then can all it's effects be known.All in all, this was a good film, with thought provoking themes and very good performances by the actors.  What is was missing though was the ability to grab a viewer and make itself truly memorable.  The film is certainly worth seeing, but it lacked that certain undefinable something that could potentially make it a great film.",3,"Good, but missing something...",1055203200,"06 10, 2003",2003,1664,"['13', 'Conversations', 'One', 'Thing', 'film', 'issues', 'doubt', 'faith', 'envy', 'happiness', 'most', 'way', 'lives', 'are', 'affected', 'even', 'smallest', 'event', 'ways', 'often', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'Obviously', 'film', 'treading', 'familiar', 'ground', 'however', 'issues', 'are', 'presented', 'fashion', 'original', 'enough', 'avoid', 'sense', 'repetitiveness', 'redundancy.The', 'film', 'presents', 'variety', 'characters', 'dealing', 'issues', 'mentioned', 'own', 'way', 'end', 'film', 'scope', 'slowly', 'broadens', 'moves', 'tight', 'focus', 'individual', 'include', 'wider', 'canvas', 'can', 'focus', 'characters', 'once', 'splendidly', 'intricate', 'ripple', 'effect', 'taken', 'place', 'characters', 'clearer', 'strength', 'film', 'here', 'when', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'big', 'picture', 'way', 'decision', 'one', 'life', 'can', 'affect', 'life', 'another.The', 'pacing', 'film', 'often', 'deliberately', 'slow', 'suffocating', 'case', 'achieve', 'director', 'goal', 'film', 'paced', 'real', 'life', 'underscoring', 'fact', 'action', 'not', 'always', 'elicit', 'immediate', 'reaction', 'reality', 'only', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'when', 'ripple', 'effect', 'reached', 'end', 'only', 'then', 'can', 'all', 'effects', 'be', 'known.All', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'thought', 'provoking', 'themes', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'actors', 'What', 'was', 'missing', 'though', 'was', 'ability', 'grab', 'viewer', 'make', 'truly', 'memorable', 'film', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'lacked', 'certain', 'undefinable', 'something', 'could', 'potentially', 'make', 'great', 'film']",N/A

I believe it is the issues discussed that were able to touch deep and the quiet, restrained way in which they were portrayed. Another reason would be the beautiful ending that does not say much but leaves you with some hope for human kind...&quot;Thirteen conversations about one thing&quot; lead to very coherent statements about the human condition. Each viewer, so I believe, will interpret what he saw in a slightly different manner. For me however the message was: reach out for other human beings - they are as lonely as you are; kindness, optimism and &quot;looking at the bright side of things&quot; have a power in spite of all and a kind word or gesture have an affect on other people - cynical as they may be; and most important: happiness is sometimes a vague term and is always better perceived at a later stage....The movie starts with a scene whose significance will be understood at a much later stage. John Turturro, playing a physics college professor is having dinner with his wife (Amy Irving) and discusses an act of violence that he suffered, trying to analyze the horror of it all and find significance and meaning in what occured. The act itself and its impact on the professor are not clear to the viewers at this stage but will become clear later on. This is the first hint to what will be one of the movie's major themes - one event is able to shake a person down and cause a change. An irreversible change.The movie brings us five human episodes that are entangled to one strong story. Matthew McConaughey is a young, confident attorney whose life changes on account of a car accident he causes; Clea Duval an optimistic kind young woman working as a cleaning lady who looses her faith in human kind on account of same accident. John Turturro is a college professor in search of happiness - in search of the &quot;something&quot; more that life has to offer. In pursuit of such happiness he leaves his wife, who is left to deal with same questions and issues, especially with the loneliness of one person in the big city. However, the most impressive acting belongs to Alan Arkin who portrays a lonely, cynical manager who has a very optimistic, good-natured employee. The employee's ability to see good in every thing hits an exposed nerve which the manager can no longer tolerate. Alan Arkin manages to deliver a round figured person including his many sides and faces, thoughts and regrets, thus forming a very realistic humane figure. Arkin is a bitter father, a manager, an ex-husband and above all a person who down beneath is kind and good, after all the masks are stripped down.  Clea Duval is another great asset to this movie, able to touch us with her tender quiet portrayal of a girl who undergoes an inner turmoil.The film is rich with metaphors and symbols that are not always evident on first viewing. One example would be the professor, Turturro writing the word &quot;Irreversible&quot; on the class blackboard while discussing the notion of anthrophy and giving us a hint to life realities as will become evident to him later on. Once you made your choice, consequences are irreversible, as Turturro will soon understand. Another example would be Clea Duval' s doll who always had one closed eye and suddenly appears with her two eyes open after her owner's inner change, as if to symbolize the new look on life she has. These are just two examples of what makes this movie rich and holding several layers of understanding.",5,An irreversible change,1069027200,"11 17, 2003",2003,3548,"['spite', 'seemingly', 'depressing', 'nature', 'tremendously', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'believe', 'issues', 'discussed', 'were', 'able', 'touch', 'deep', 'quiet', 'restrained', 'way', 'were', 'portrayed', 'reason', 'would', 'be', 'beautiful', 'ending', 'not', 'say', 'much', 'hope', 'human', 'kind', 'quot', 'Thirteen', 'conversations', 'one', 'thing', 'quot', 'lead', 'very', 'coherent', 'statements', 'human', 'condition', 'viewer', 'believe', 'will', 'interpret', 'what', 'saw', 'slightly', 'different', 'manner', 'however', 'message', 'was', 'reach', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'as', 'lonely', 'are', 'kindness', 'optimism', 'quot', 'looking', 'bright', 'side', 'things', 'quot', 'have', 'power', 'spite', 'kind', 'word', 'gesture', 'have', 'affect', 'other', 'people', 'cynical', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'important', 'happiness', 'sometimes', 'vague', 'term', 'always', 'better', 'perceived', 'later', 'stage', '.The', 'movie', 'scene', 'significance', 'will', 'be', 'understood', 'much', 'later', 'stage', 'John', 'Turturro', 'playing', 'physics', 'college', 'professor', 'having', 'dinner', 'wife', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'act', 'violence', 'suffered', 'trying', 'analyze', 'horror', 'find', 'significance', 'meaning', 'what', 'occured', 'act', 'impact', 'professor', 'are', 'not', 'clear', 'viewers', 'stage', 'will', 'become', 'clear', 'later', 'first', 'hint', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'movie', 'major', 'themes', 'one', 'event', 'able', 'shake', 'person', 'down', 'cause', 'change', 'irreversible', 'change.The', 'movie', 'five', 'human', 'episodes', 'are', 'entangled', 'one', 'strong', 'story', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'young', 'confident', 'attorney', 'life', 'changes', 'account', 'car', 'accident', 'Clea', 'Duval', 'optimistic', 'kind', 'young', 'woman', 'working', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'who', 'faith', 'human', 'kind', 'account', 'same', 'accident', 'John', 'Turturro', 'college', 'professor', 'search', 'happiness', 'search', 'quot', 'something', 'quot', 'more', 'life', 'offer', 'pursuit', 'such', 'happiness', 'wife', 'who', 'left', 'deal', 'same', 'questions', 'issues', 'especially', 'loneliness', 'one', 'person', 'big', 'city', 'However', 'most', 'impressive', 'acting', 'belongs', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'who', 'lonely', 'cynical', 'manager', 'who', 'very', 'optimistic', 'good-natured', 'employee', 'employee', 'ability', 'see', 'good', 'thing', 'exposed', 'nerve', 'manager', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'tolerate', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'deliver', 'round', 'figured', 'person', 'including', 'many', 'sides', 'thoughts', 'regrets', 'thus', 'forming', 'very', 'realistic', 'humane', 'figure', 'Arkin', 'bitter', 'father', 'manager', 'ex-husband', 'person', 'who', 'beneath', 'kind', 'good', 'masks', 'are', 'stripped', 'down', 'Clea', 'Duval', 'great', 'asset', 'movie', 'able', 'touch', 'tender', 'quiet', 'portrayal', 'girl', 'who', 'inner', 'turmoil.The', 'film', 'rich', 'metaphors', 'symbols', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'evident', 'first', 'viewing', 'One', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'professor', 'Turturro', 'writing', 'word', 'quot', 'Irreversible', 'quot', 'class', 'blackboard', 'discussing', 'notion', 'anthrophy', 'giving', 'hint', 'life', 'realities', 'will', 'become', 'evident', 'later', 'made', 'choice', 'consequences', 'are', 'irreversible', 'Turturro', 'will', 'soon', 'understand', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'Clea', 'Duval', 's', 'doll', 'who', 'always', 'had', 'one', 'closed', 'eye', 'suddenly', 'two', 'eyes', 'open', 'owner', 'inner', 'change', 'symbolize', 'new', 'look', 'life', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'examples', 'what', 'movie', 'rich', 'holding', 'several', 'layers', 'understanding']",N/A

719887,A2KU5PG32H7QBN,B00006L927,"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic""","[6, 7]","First of all, I must state that this is one of the best of 2002, sadly overlooked because of its small size compared to movies like ""Chicago,"" ""The Two Towers,"" and ""Gangs of New York.""  But I'm just glad that I had the chance to see it.  I will never forget this moving drama that is like a mosaic of ancient Rome, different colors coming together to form one, astounding picture.Second of all, this is a movie that people who can't stand straight out drama's or character pieces or even movies with no real powerful climax shouldn't see.  This is my big disclaimer for this movie.  If any of those descriptions or catgories unsettle you in any way, don't continue reading this review.  This is an artistic film, rather than a film meant to purely entertain.  It is meant to leave you with a feeling.  I certainly returned to Blockbuster to give it back with a sort of mixed happiness, and sadness knowning that happiness isn't permanant, and that I shouldn't expect it to be, or I will never be happy.Yes, this movie is about happiness.  One of the greatest things about this movie was that it was made in segments, once again, much like a mosaic, seperated by lines of grout, sort of like a map.  The grout in this movie was a sequence of black screens with white type on them saying thigns like ""Show Me a Happy Man"" and then it will play a segment with two of the main characters discussnig something like this line.  It really adds a lot of artistic qualities and individuality to the film.The characters are as follows (the main ones anyway): An angry lawyer man (a brilliant Alan Arkin), a slightly cocky crime lawyer (a ""pretty good"" Matthew McCaughnohay), a wonderfully positive, but not for long, cleaning lady (a wonderful Clea DuVall) and a nerdy, overly-organized teacher (John Turtoro) who all go through a process of interconnecting stories, a weaved basket if you will (I love metaphors), that affect their lives in one single way...they find what happiness is, and what it is not.  It is really interesting how their lives change over time.  It really is a movie about thirteen discussions concerning a single topic.Okay, next on the list is this one scene I must describe to you.  Throughout the movie, Alan Arkin's character is attempting to reconcile with his unconformist, druggy son.  His son can't deal with the pressure and runs off into an alley after stealing a woman's purse.  What he uses it for is drugs, hence his problem.  He runs over into the green walled corner, a sort of creamy,  mild green, and he wraps the leather strap from the purse around his arm.  He starts to use heroin, and as he is applying the syringe and pressing in, there is a crane shot of the green alley and him in the off center focus of the camera.  Suddenly, all of these little square pieces of white paper float all around him, like snow.  He looks around, as you can see his pleasured expression on his face from the drugs.  I wrote a poem about this beautifully filmed, but depressing moment.  It ended with the image of ""doves perched on a corpse.""  To me, this moment meant false happiness.  Like those white pieces of paper resembled the pure fun and happiness and enjoyment all of the people around him had.  But there he was, with a syringe in his arm, pushing in these great feelings because he can't get it from what he has.  It adds such an important affect to the movie.  Really pay attention to that seen.  And the technical part of that scene that you must know is the importance of the crane/ariel shot.  In this scene, it produces a sort of sepperation, like you're one of those pieces of paper falling down onto the ground next to him, saying ""I'm happy and you're not!""  This is probably one of the most effective scenes in a film I have ever seen.Bottom Line: This movie was deprived of acting, best picture (possibly), cinematography and script Oscars most definately, because it is one of the masterpieces of the century; absolutely, positively perfect!
