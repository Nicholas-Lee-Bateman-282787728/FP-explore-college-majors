493564,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000006D1S,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[5, 5]","Tokyo Story is universal in theme, the aging parents and their relationship to their grown children.  In post war Japan, an old couple make a visit to their children in Tokyo.  Upon arrival, the elderly are soon ignored, shuffled here and there, while simply, a burden during their visit.  The old couple are compliant to their childrens' distant attention and being shuffled around.Although the elderly couple know their childrens' careers are not as successful as the couple would like, but as the parents, they accept that, knowing at this time in their lives, only family and love matters.  Even a doctor is in the family, and we don't see him as successful.The couple has learned that time changes, tradition changes and relationships change, so they can understand the grandchildren's cold feelings with no endearing reactions.  Sadly, Tomi, the old lady never experienced love that comes from grandchildren like most people and she says, ""Some people like their grandchildren more than their children....I like my children more.""The only love and attention they get is from a daughter-in-law, Noriko, who was married to their son who is now dead. Soon, the couple heads back home and mother Tomi gets sick.Criterion PackageTo have Criterion present a classic film, you know there are plenty of extras along with the DVD film itself.  Also, while many of Criterion's film releases are in black and white, the English subtitles often pose a challenge to read.But with Criterion, you get great features, sometimes great commentary, documentaries, deleted scenes, interviews, and more!  In Tokyo Story double disc, the commentary is excellent as it follows the movie.  We see and learn a great deal about Ozua and his film style from this commentary that is exclusive to the movie.A 40 minute tribute to Ozu is included along with a two-hour documentary on Ozu  provides detailed information about the director and his style.  What's also great is that you get a snippet of many of his other films and his low angle camera style.  Ozu's scenes are like none I have seen before.  The Japanese characters always getting up and down from the floor, and are leaving and entering frames and you soon notice it to be unique filming.Watching Tokyo Story has it's demands, many Japanese characters are introduced, so you must pay attention to know the characters' names and their relationships, while reading.  Tokyo Story remains on the list of best in foreign film.  Its message will never become dated....MzRizz",5,Getting Old is a Real Pain!,1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,2509,"['Tokyo', 'Story', 'universal', 'theme', 'aging', 'parents', 'relationship', 'grown', 'children', 'post', 'war', 'Japan', 'old', 'couple', 'make', 'visit', 'children', 'Tokyo', 'Upon', 'arrival', 'elderly', 'are', 'soon', 'ignored', 'shuffled', 'here', 'there', 'simply', 'burden', 'visit', 'old', 'couple', 'are', 'compliant', 'childrens', 'distant', 'attention', 'being', 'shuffled', 'elderly', 'couple', 'know', 'childrens', 'careers', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'successful', 'couple', 'would', 'like', 'parents', 'accept', 'knowing', 'time', 'lives', 'only', 'family', 'love', 'matters', 'Even', 'doctor', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'successful.The', 'couple', 'learned', 'time', 'changes', 'tradition', 'changes', 'relationships', 'change', 'can', 'understand', 'grandchildren', 'cold', 'feelings', 'endearing', 'reactions', 'Sadly', 'Tomi', 'old', 'lady', 'never', 'experienced', 'grandchildren', 'most', 'people', 'people', 'grandchildren', 'more', 'children', '.I', 'children', 'more', 'only', 'love', 'attention', 'get', 'daughter-in-law', 'Noriko', 'who', 'was', 'married', 'son', 'who', 'now', 'dead', 'Soon', 'couple', 'back', 'home', 'mother', 'Tomi', 'sick.Criterion', 'PackageTo', 'have', 'Criterion', 'present', 'classic', 'film', 'know', 'are', 'plenty', 'extras', 'DVD', 'film', 'Also', 'many', 'Criterion', 'film', 'releases', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'English', 'subtitles', 'often', 'pose', 'challenge', 'read.But', 'Criterion', 'get', 'great', 'features', 'sometimes', 'great', 'commentary', 'documentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'more', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'double', 'disc', 'commentary', 'excellent', 'movie', 'see', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'Ozua', 'film', 'style', 'commentary', 'exclusive', 'movie.A', '40', 'minute', 'tribute', 'Ozu', 'included', 'two-hour', 'documentary', 'Ozu', 'detailed', 'information', 'director', 'style', 'What', 'also', 'great', 'get', 'snippet', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'low', 'angle', 'camera', 'style', 'Ozu', 'scenes', 'are', 'none', 'have', 'seen', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'always', 'getting', 'up', 'down', 'floor', 'are', 'leaving', 'entering', 'frames', 'soon', 'notice', 'be', 'unique', 'filming.Watching', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'demands', 'many', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'must', 'pay', 'attention', 'know', 'characters', 'names', 'relationships', 'reading', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'list', 'best', 'foreign', 'film', 'message', 'will', 'never', 'become', 'dated', '.MzRizz']",N/A

493567,A1LBIZLET9CW1I,B000006D1S,A fellow with a keyboard,"[3, 3]","In this film, which has been named to several top-10 lists (including Ebert's) and which has been called Ozu's masterpiece, we see a contrast between modern, post-war self-involved ""busy"" people and the glowing version of Ozu's ideal woman - and person - in Noriko (Setsuko Hara), a woman who is infinitely kind and self-sacrificing. One novelist said of Hara, ""We would sigh or let out a great breath from the depths of our hearts, for what we felt was precisely this: Can it be possible that there is such a woman in this world?""Like all of Ozu's films, Tokyo Story's pacing is ""calm,"" and important events are often not shown on screen, only implied. The camera never moves so as to elevate the feeling of calmness, which is quite unlike what you might be used to seeing in your motion pictures.It's remarkable how relatable and moving this film is after 60 years, especially since it originated from a culture that couldn't have been more different than my own. But if you aren't familiar/comfortable with meditative films, I might suggest that before jumping into this film you get your feet wet with films likeGates of HeavenorThe White Diamond, which are equally as meditative but have more modern pacing and camera work.",4,I'm glad I didn't see this when I was 20,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,1228,"['film', 'been', 'named', 'several', 'top-10', 'lists', 'including', 'Ebert', 'been', 'called', 'Ozu', 'masterpiece', 'see', 'contrast', 'modern', 'post-war', 'self-involved', 'busy', 'people', 'glowing', 'version', 'Ozu', 'ideal', 'woman', 'person', 'Noriko', 'Setsuko', 'Hara', 'woman', 'who', 'infinitely', 'kind', 'self-sacrificing', 'One', 'novelist', 'said', 'Hara', 'would', 'sigh', 'let', 'out', 'great', 'breath', 'depths', 'hearts', 'what', 'felt', 'was', 'precisely', 'Can', 'be', 'possible', 'such', 'woman', 'world', 'Ozu', 'films', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'pacing', 'calm', 'important', 'events', 'are', 'often', 'not', 'shown', 'screen', 'only', 'implied', 'camera', 'never', 'so', 'elevate', 'feeling', 'calmness', 'quite', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'used', 'seeing', 'motion', 'pictures.It', 'remarkable', 'how', 'relatable', 'moving', 'film', '60', 'years', 'especially', 'originated', 'culture', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'different', 'own', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar/comfortable', 'meditative', 'films', 'might', 'suggest', 'before', 'jumping', 'film', 'get', 'feet', 'wet', 'films', 'likeGates', 'HeavenorThe', 'White', 'Diamond', 'are', 'equally', 'meditative', 'have', 'more', 'modern', 'pacing', 'camera', 'work']",N/A
493568,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000006D1S,Alex Udvary,"[7, 8]","The name Yasujiro Ozu is known by mostly (and only) extreme filmbuffs. Most of the general public has no clue who he is. This is very unfortunate. His films are not as widely accepted as another great Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. Kurosawa as many know was not see to be a great filmmaker in his homeland. He was considered too &quot;western&quot;. Which is exactly why the American public has embraced his films. Ozu on the other hand, was seen more as a Japanese filmmaker. Sticking more to that tradition. All I want to say is &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; is a beautiful ( and I never use that word to describe a film!) warm, and highly emotional film. Anyone with a heart should be able to feel for the characters in this film. I've seen several tear-jerkers in my time lol. Mostly the over done Hollywood films. While, yes some of those films are good, none of them really seem as sincere as this movie. It really hits you at a gut level. The story is about two ederly people; Shukishi (Chishu Ryu) and Tomi (Chieko Higashiyama) Hirayama going to Tokyo to visit their childern, whom they never really get the chance to see since they live so far away. Once they arrive there, they are greeted somewhat coldly. Their own childern don't seem very please to see them! They feel they're such a burden to them, that instead of having them stay with them, they suggest they get a room in a spa. All of their childern and in-laws (Zen Murase, and Kyoko Kagawa) say they are too busy to do things with them. But, the funny thing is, all we see them do is sit down and fan themselves lol. I guess this was the point Ozu was trying to make. That after a while, once childern grow up, they in a way feel as if they have &quot;no use&quot; for their parents. They come up with excuses for not spending time with them. The ONLY person who remains nice to them is their dead son's wife Noriko. It takes a stranger to show them a good time. The screenplay here written by Ozu himself and Kogo Noda is a movie everyone can relate to, because we all have parents! Maybe, sometimes you have found yourself acting with your parents in the same selfish way these characters did. It takes a sad event to make everyone come together for a brief momemt. Ozu loved making films about topics we all can relate to. The relationships parents have with their childern (this film and &quot;Floating Weeds&quot;), about parents watching their childern growing up and must realize their childern will move out and get married (His final film &quot;An Autumn Afternoon&quot;). He dealt with things everyone can relate too. It is for this reason this movie will please not only fans of Ozu, who've come to know what to expect from him, but non fans will find something enjoyable about this movie. This is a slow, tender, warm, and touching movie. Everyone has to try and make an effort to see this film! You'll thank me in the end.",4,A slow but beautiful film,989625600,"05 12, 2001",2001,2903,"['name', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'known', 'mostly', 'only', 'extreme', 'filmbuffs', 'Most', 'general', 'public', 'clue', 'who', 'very', 'unfortunate', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'widely', 'accepted', 'great', 'Japanese', 'filmmaker', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'Kurosawa', 'many', 'know', 'was', 'not', 'see', 'be', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'homeland', 'was', 'considered', 'too', 'quot', 'western', 'quot', 'Which', 'exactly', 'why', 'American', 'public', 'embraced', 'films', 'Ozu', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'seen', 'more', 'Japanese', 'filmmaker', 'Sticking', 'more', 'tradition', 'want', 'say', 'quot', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'quot', 'beautiful', 'never', 'use', 'word', 'describe', 'film', 'warm', 'highly', 'emotional', 'film', 'Anyone', 'heart', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'feel', 'characters', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'tear-jerkers', 'time', 'lol', 'Mostly', 'done', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'yes', 'films', 'are', 'good', 'none', 'really', 'seem', 'as', 'sincere', 'movie', 'really', 'gut', 'level', 'story', 'two', 'ederly', 'people', 'Shukishi', 'Chishu', 'Ryu', 'Tomi', 'Chieko', 'Higashiyama', 'Hirayama', 'going', 'Tokyo', 'visit', 'childern', 'whom', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'live', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'arrive', 'there', 'are', 'greeted', 'somewhat', 'coldly', 'own', 'childern', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'please', 'see', 'feel', ""'re"", 'burden', 'instead', 'having', 'stay', 'suggest', 'get', 'room', 'spa', 'childern', 'in-laws', 'Zen', 'Murase', 'Kyoko', 'Kagawa', 'say', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'do', 'things', 'funny', 'thing', 'see', 'do', 'sit', 'down', 'fan', 'lol', 'guess', 'was', 'point', 'Ozu', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'while', 'once', 'childern', 'grow', 'up', 'way', 'feel', 'have', 'quot', 'use', 'quot', 'parents', 'come', 'up', 'excuses', 'not', 'spending', 'time', 'ONLY', 'person', 'who', 'nice', 'dead', 'son', 'wife', 'Noriko', 'stranger', 'show', 'good', 'time', 'screenplay', 'here', 'written', 'Ozu', 'Kogo', 'Noda', 'movie', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'have', 'parents', 'Maybe', 'sometimes', 'have', 'found', 'acting', 'parents', 'same', 'selfish', 'way', 'characters', 'did', 'sad', 'event', 'make', 'everyone', 'come', 'together', 'brief', 'momemt', 'Ozu', 'loved', 'making', 'films', 'topics', 'can', 'relate', 'relationships', 'parents', 'have', 'childern', 'film', 'quot', 'Floating', 'Weeds', 'quot', 'parents', 'watching', 'childern', 'growing', 'up', 'must', 'realize', 'childern', 'will', 'move', 'out', 'get', 'married', 'final', 'film', 'quot', 'Autumn', 'Afternoon', 'quot', 'things', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'too', 'reason', 'movie', 'will', 'please', 'not', 'only', 'fans', 'Ozu', 'who', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'non', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'slow', 'tender', 'warm', 'touching', 'movie', 'Everyone', 'try', 'make', 'effort', 'see', 'film', ""'ll"", 'thank', 'end']",N/A
493569,A2DW2FGYMHV7QJ,B000006D1S,"Amazon Customer ""maldoror_de_sade""","[8, 8]","Continually voted into the Sight and Sound poll as one of the top 10 films ever made, ""Tokyo Story"" is a great introduction to Ozu's work, and Japanese cinema entirely.  Made in the 50's, the film hasn't aged at all: it's a film for all generations.The plot is very simple: An elderly couple visit their children, who are too busy to spend time with them.  Their children continue to avoid them, purposely (even sending them off to a spa at one point), until a death brings all of them together, but only temporarily.  That's the plot.  But what emerges is a very *human* film, as the strongest human emotions are displayed on screen, and suddenly you feel the same emotions, and start thinking about your own life and your relationship with your parents.  Even though Ozu is labeled as ""the most Japanese"" director, the themes in ""Tokyo Story"" are universal.  Ethnicity doesn't matter.  Age doesn't matter either; this movie makes an impact on adults as well as their children.And Ozu does all of this rather effortlessly.  Nothing in the plot seems to unfold by surprise; things just happen.  No fancy camera tricks either; in fact, almost no camera movement at all.  The camera moves only twice in this 2+ hour film.  All of these factors contribute to the greatness of the film, a film that we can learn a lot from, and one that we can return to every couple of years.  And it is all done in the simplest manner possible.Criterion did a great job with the film.  The film looks better than the VHS version, and the subtitles are easier to read.  There's still a lot of grain and flickering, but one can only guess that the film itself was beyond major reparations.  The commentary is informative (You'll learn a lot about Ozu's meticulous planning in each scene), and the extras, such as a 2 hour documentary on Ozu's life and work, will only result in you wanting to see all of his films.  Supposedly more are on the way from Criterion, so stay tuned.",5,Grace and simplicity = timeless masterpiece,1071705600,"12 18, 2003",2003,1956,"['Continually', 'voted', 'Sight', 'Sound', 'poll', 'one', 'top', '10', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'great', 'introduction', 'Ozu', 'work', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'entirely', 'Made', '50', 'film', ""n't"", 'aged', 'film', 'generations.The', 'plot', 'very', 'simple', 'elderly', 'couple', 'visit', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'spend', 'time', 'children', 'continue', 'avoid', 'purposely', 'even', 'sending', 'off', 'spa', 'one', 'point', 'death', 'together', 'only', 'temporarily', 'plot', 'what', 'very', '*human*', 'film', 'strongest', 'human', 'emotions', 'are', 'displayed', 'screen', 'suddenly', 'feel', 'same', 'emotions', 'start', 'thinking', 'own', 'life', 'relationship', 'parents', 'Even', 'Ozu', 'labeled', 'most', 'Japanese', 'director', 'themes', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'are', 'universal', 'Ethnicity', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Age', ""n't"", 'matter', 'either', 'movie', 'impact', 'adults', 'as', 'well', 'children.And', 'Ozu', 'rather', 'effortlessly', 'Nothing', 'plot', 'unfold', 'surprise', 'things', 'just', 'happen', 'fancy', 'camera', 'fact', 'almost', 'camera', 'movement', 'camera', 'only', 'twice', '2+', 'hour', 'film', 'factors', 'contribute', 'greatness', 'film', 'film', 'can', 'learn', 'lot', 'one', 'can', 'return', 'couple', 'years', 'done', 'simplest', 'manner', 'possible.Criterion', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'film', 'film', 'better', 'VHS', 'version', 'subtitles', 'are', 'easier', 'read', 'still', 'lot', 'grain', 'flickering', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'film', 'was', 'major', 'reparations', 'commentary', 'informative', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'lot', 'Ozu', 'meticulous', 'planning', 'scene', 'extras', 'such', '2', 'hour', 'documentary', 'Ozu', 'life', 'work', 'will', 'only', 'result', 'wanting', 'see', 'films', 'Supposedly', 'more', 'are', 'way', 'Criterion', 'so', 'stay', 'tuned']",N/A
493570,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000006D1S,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","A lot of my friends had told me this film was exceptional.  In fact, most of them consider it one of the best films they have ever seen.  I'm not going to heap on it that much praise.  In fact, I often compared this film to Akira Kurosawa's own `Ikiru' (which was released the year prior) while watching it and I must admit I find Kurosawa's masterpiece a little more focused and moving.  That said, `Tokyo Monogatari' is a stunning film and one that should be seen and experienced by any and all lovers of film.The film tells the story of an elderly couple who travel to Tokyo to visit their children.  Upon their arrival it is apparent that their children are less than enthused about their presence.  They shrug all any and all responsibility in actually entertaining them, resorting to shelling out money to send them away to a spa so that they don't have to see them.  The children are busy with their own lives; their own children and their own jobs.  While they never outright tell their parents that their company is a burden, they make it known by their obvious bitter spirit and their condescending comments masked over by a faux sense of concern.  Amidst all of this hostility, this elderly couple finds solace in the caring arms of their daughter-in-law, Noriko.  Noriko's husband has been dead for years, but she still holds her in-laws in high esteem and considers them her family.  While their own flesh and blood seems put out by their presence, Noriko goes out of her way to accommodate them.  This quality displays itself even further when tragedy strikes and the Hirayama family are placed under a different kind of strain.One of the most beautiful things about `Tokyo Monogatari' is the subtlety with which it is constructed.  There isn't a broad stroke in the film, and that goes a long way to creating a very real and relatable atmosphere.  Each child is painted with their own set of trials that contribute to the person they have become, but no one is fleshed out enough to become definitive on their own.  We are left to draw conclusions for ourselves.  While I enjoy this aspect of the film's storytelling, I also wish it had been a little more elaborate in parts.My main complaint here is the performances from the two leads, more specifically that of Chishu Ryu.  I often have to remind myself that culture and era play into how performances are cultivated, but there is something about Ryu's performance that feels too stilted, too stiff.  The character is so rich and open to a varying amount of internal and external flavor, and yet there is a blandness that carries itself throughout the performance.  Ryu drags Higashiyama down a tad, but she manages to bring a life to Tomi that makes her stand out.  Outside of that, the performances here are all rather spectacular, especially Setsuko Hara who gives Noriko such a beautiful light.  She becomes much more than just a clich&eacute;d offset to the bitterness surrounding her, but she feels real and accessible.You want to know her.I know it seems like I pointed out the films `faults' (as I see them) but honestly, the film is still rather remarkable and certainly worthy of all the five-star reviews it has received.  As a reflective emotional piece, the film is layered with very profound and provoking themes that burrow deep into the minds and hearts of the audience.  Showing the lack of respect the elderly receive from those who should revere them, `Tokyo Monogatari' understands how to inject the right amount of raw realism into each frame.  As a story, this film nails every aspect of a GREAT story, and as an artistic piece it also seems to soar.  I recommend this film without hesitation.  The first half may seem to linger on a bit too long for some, but the second half fully fleshes out the emotional impact desired here and manages to speak volumes about the internal struggle we as humans undergo when trying to balance out the life we live with the ties we have to our family.  For me, family relationships are definitely the most complicated and certainly the hardest to truly identify, cultivate and maintain.  `Tokyo Monogatari' shows that even the best intentions can result in turmoil.  There is always room to learn from our mistakes, we just hope we don't learn too late (poor, poor Keiso).",5,A story to tell...,1282521600,"08 23, 2010",2010,4298,"['lot', 'friends', 'had', 'told', 'film', 'was', 'exceptional', 'fact', 'most', 'consider', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'heap', 'much', 'praise', 'fact', 'often', 'compared', 'film', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'own', 'Ikiru', 'was', 'released', 'year', 'prior', 'watching', 'must', 'admit', 'find', 'Kurosawa', 'masterpiece', 'little', 'more', 'focused', 'moving', 'said', 'Tokyo', 'Monogatari', 'stunning', 'film', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'experienced', 'lovers', 'film.The', 'film', 'story', 'elderly', 'couple', 'who', 'travel', 'Tokyo', 'visit', 'children', 'arrival', 'apparent', 'children', 'are', 'less', 'enthused', 'presence', 'shrug', 'responsibility', 'actually', 'entertaining', 'resorting', 'shelling', 'out', 'money', 'send', 'away', 'spa', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'children', 'are', 'busy', 'own', 'lives', 'own', 'children', 'own', 'jobs', 'never', 'outright', 'tell', 'parents', 'company', 'burden', 'make', 'known', 'obvious', 'bitter', 'spirit', 'condescending', 'comments', 'masked', 'faux', 'sense', 'concern', 'Amidst', 'hostility', 'elderly', 'couple', 'finds', 'solace', 'caring', 'arms', 'daughter-in-law', 'Noriko', 'Noriko', 'husband', 'been', 'dead', 'years', 'still', 'in-laws', 'high', 'esteem', 'considers', 'family', 'own', 'flesh', 'blood', 'put', 'out', 'presence', 'Noriko', 'way', 'accommodate', 'quality', 'even', 'further', 'when', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'Hirayama', 'family', 'are', 'placed', 'different', 'kind', 'strain.One', 'most', 'beautiful', 'things', 'Tokyo', 'Monogatari', 'subtlety', 'constructed', ""n't"", 'broad', 'stroke', 'film', 'long', 'way', 'creating', 'very', 'real', 'relatable', 'atmosphere', 'child', 'painted', 'own', 'set', 'trials', 'contribute', 'person', 'have', 'become', 'one', 'fleshed', 'out', 'enough', 'become', 'definitive', 'own', 'are', 'left', 'draw', 'conclusions', 'ourselves', 'enjoy', 'aspect', 'film', 'storytelling', 'also', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'elaborate', 'parts.My', 'main', 'complaint', 'here', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'more', 'specifically', 'Chishu', 'Ryu', 'often', 'have', 'remind', 'culture', 'era', 'play', 'how', 'performances', 'are', 'cultivated', 'something', 'Ryu', 'performance', 'too', 'stilted', 'too', 'stiff', 'character', 'so', 'rich', 'open', 'varying', 'amount', 'internal', 'external', 'flavor', 'yet', 'blandness', 'performance', 'Ryu', 'Higashiyama', 'down', 'tad', 'bring', 'life', 'Tomi', 'stand', 'out', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'rather', 'spectacular', 'especially', 'Setsuko', 'Hara', 'who', 'Noriko', 'beautiful', 'light', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'clich', 'eacute', 'offset', 'bitterness', 'surrounding', 'real', 'accessible.You', 'want', 'know', 'her.I', 'know', 'pointed', 'out', 'films', 'faults', 'see', 'honestly', 'film', 'still', 'rather', 'remarkable', 'certainly', 'worthy', 'five-star', 'reviews', 'received', 'reflective', 'emotional', 'piece', 'film', 'layered', 'very', 'profound', 'provoking', 'themes', 'burrow', 'deep', 'minds', 'hearts', 'audience', 'Showing', 'lack', 'respect', 'elderly', 'receive', 'who', 'should', 'revere', 'Tokyo', 'Monogatari', 'how', 'inject', 'right', 'amount', 'raw', 'realism', 'frame', 'story', 'film', 'aspect', 'GREAT', 'story', 'artistic', 'piece', 'also', 'soar', 'recommend', 'film', 'hesitation', 'first', 'half', 'may', 'seem', 'linger', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'second', 'half', 'fully', 'out', 'emotional', 'impact', 'desired', 'here', 'speak', 'volumes', 'internal', 'struggle', 'humans', 'undergo', 'when', 'trying', 'balance', 'out', 'life', 'live', 'ties', 'have', 'family', 'family', 'relationships', 'are', 'definitely', 'most', 'complicated', 'certainly', 'hardest', 'truly', 'identify', 'cultivate', 'maintain', 'Tokyo', 'Monogatari', 'shows', 'even', 'best', 'intentions', 'can', 'result', 'turmoil', 'always', 'room', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'just', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'too', 'late', 'poor', 'poor', 'Keiso']",N/A
493571,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B000006D1S,Anthony L.,"[2, 2]","I can honestly say that Tokyo Story is one of the saddest and most poignant movies ever made. It is also a cinematic masterpiece of framing, editing, and pacing. The acting is so real and brilliant, that, when coupled with Ozu's signature POV angles, you feel as if you are witnessing real people and real events. This is a story that we can all relate to, even if we do not want to. The premise is very, very simple: an elderly couple visits their grown up children who live in Tokyo. The children, sadly, view the old people as a burden and a chore. Ironically, the only people kind to the old couple are the widow of their middle-son, and, to a lesser extent, their first daughter's husband.Tokyo Story is one of those films, like Kurosawa'sRashomonand Hitchcock'sVertigo, that are nearly perfect in every manner. Director Yasujiro Ozu's camera is static, and is usually three feet up off the ground - the height of a person sitting on a tatami mat. His editing is flawless, taking in every motion and movement of the characters, often lingering on an empty room while they are gone to signify the movement and passing of life. Oftentimes, Ozu breaks the sacred cinematic rules of eyelines, and has his characters talk almost directly into the camera. Again, this gives an almost fly-on-the-wall effect for the viewer.There is little music in Tokyo Story, but when there is music it is well-chosen and situated perfectly. Music, as director Michael Haneke knew for his masterpieceAmour, can be used to cheapen the effect of a scene for sentimental value. Like Haneke after him, Ozu chooses instead to rely on his extraordinarily talented actors, immaculate framing, and a perfect sense of timing to make a point and elicit emotions. He also uses silence. Tokyo Story shows that a well-placed, contemplative second of silence is worth more than all the music in the world.Yasujiro Ozu's actor's are more than ready for the job. The great star from the Golden Age of Japanese cinema - Setsuko Hara, shines as Noriko, the kindly and goodhearted daughter in law of the Shukichi and Tomi. Haruko Sugimara as Shige performs brilliantly as the often cold but sensible daughter. The rest of the cast is beyond criticism; they all work together as a poignant and believable family. Shiro Osaka as Keizo has a small role, but performed admirably as the prodigal son who may just be the most loyal of all the children.The real star of the film, however, is Chishu Ryu as the grandfather Shukichi. With just a nod or a look, he conveys more emotions than could ever be expressed in words. He plays a sympathetic, caring, world-weary old man, one of the most touching and tragic characters in cinematic history.I guarantee you he will break your heart with his haunting gaze near the end of the film. Foreign cinema is so often overlooked, but in my opinion, Ryu gives one of the greatest performances in a tragic film role ever. And his performances is all the more brilliant when he does nothing at all....Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story is one of the finest, saddest films ever made. It is Ozu's magnum opus, a socially relevant look on family values, love, loss, and old age. Without contrived emotion or cheap sentimentality, the cast will break your heart, and Ozu, with his immaculate framing and perfect editing, will astound your senses. Tokyo Story is that rare film for the contemplative viewer; one that will excite your eyes and your heart. A film you will never forget.5 Stars! Highly Recommended!P.S.

This is the Ozu picture most people associate with him, yet it was but one in a long string of films beginning in the 1920s and ending in the early 60s.  It was the first Ozu film I saw, in it's initial American run in 1968, and I was disappointed by it.  As hard as it is to believe, it left me completely unmoved.  Articles about Ozu had really spurred my interest in this man, but my initial experience with Ozu disappointed me.  To my American eye, I could not reconcile myself to the uncanny closeups of people speaking their dialogue directly into the camera, as though though directly to us.  Also the odd quirks like focusing attention on random objects placed in the foreground against scenic backgrounds, the lack of 'tricks' like fade-in fade-out, tracking shots, wipes and other essentials of film grammar was very disconcerting.  The sentiment of 'Tokyo Story' was totally lost on me.  I preferred the accessible, recognizable humor of 'Storys' companion picture on my first Ozu double bill, 'Ohayo,' and it was years before I had an opportunity to see 'Tokyo Story' again.  Then it hit me like an bulldozer.  Each and every gesture in this picture is carefully calculated and carefully laid out, yet the emotion begins to peak at it's own pace, it's own uncanny rhythm.  The 'tricks' that I considered so important to move a movie forward were exposed as just what they were, 'tricks,' and the logic of Ozu's universe was making itself known to me.  It's a little like revisiting family members who once left you feeling cold and disinterested (like the grandkids in this film feel toward their grandparents), only to come back years later and see them as incredibly loving and  human.  Perhaps you will have the same reaction to Ozu's films.

An elderly couple go to Tokyo by train on a rare visit to their children; when they get there they realize their children really don't have the time or interest to be with them. Only a widowed daughter-in-law shows them any genuine kindness.What makes this a truly great movie is the subtlety of all the action: the children aren't blatantly mean, just wrapped up in their own lives and self-centered. They talk as if they care, but the real feelings of concern aren't there. They send their parents to a seaside resort and rationalize it as the chance for them to rest, see something different, have a good time, but really they send them there just to get them off their hands. Though subtly executed, it's an acute indictment against not only ungrateful children but against indifference in general, and it will be a rare viewer, I think, who doesn't feel the pangs of that reproach personally. The dignity and grace of the elderly couple (played brilliantly by Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama) through all this is magnificently displayed - and it's heartbreaking to watch. Their children are an obvious disappointment to them, yet they treat them with dignity and respect - much more than they deserve.

Of the 3 films I've seen so far this is the saddest one; and it feels like we've reached the end of a saga. Death closes this sequence of films: 'Late Spring', 'Early Summer' and this one; and writes a sad epitaph to life: life is sad and there's nothing we can do about it.I didn't like it as much as the other two Ozu films mentioned, not because it's worse, but because it's pessimistic and leaves no room for hope (which could be very accurate, however). The best advice we are left is resignation. Children will become parents, and then grandparents; and probably they will be treated the same way they treated their own parents and grandparents before.But do children really have to grow cold to their parents as they become older, or is there something we can do about it? The youngest daughter asks this to Setsuko Hara (daughter-in-law). She is pessimistic, times change everybody, and they will change too. But she herself is the living example that this is not so. She is not even a blood relative, however, she did more for the old couple than any relative. Setsuko Hara is the most positive and conservative character in Ozu's films. Times may change people's values and weaken human institutions, like the most basic one, families, but she will remain steadfast to those values inherited by generations down to the present. I would have preferred to see Setsuko in a happier mood, like in the other two films mentioned.

493578,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000006D1S,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[3, 3]","There are many roads to greatness. This is a notion that I have always held to be true. No greater example of this could be given than by comparing the films of two of the greatest filmmakers from Japan. Of course, most people have heard of Akira Kurosawa and his classics like Seven Samurai, Rashomon, and Ikiru. But there is also Yasujiro Ozu (1903-1963), whose canon of films is set in modern times far more often than Kurosawa's.  Where Kurosawa was grand, Ozu is small. Where Kurosawa was kinetic, Ozu was static. Where Kurosawa celebrated the epic, Ozu celebrated the ordinary. Yet, despite their differences, their greatest films are indisputable masterpieces of cinema, even if they achieve their ends in seemingly contradictory ways.Perhaps the greatest of all Ozu films is his 1953 black and white classic Tokyo Story (Tokyo monogatari), which follows a simple story outline, unfolds very slowly - the film is two hours and fifteen minutes long, builds its power through the slow accumulation of facts, and the deft, but subtle revelation of character. In short, it's everything that Hollywood films are not, and it would never have been produced there, then or now. It has been derided as being stale, dull, and plodding, even as it has alternately been chided as melodramatic and a third rate soap opera. Such definitions only go to show how little the claimants know of the words they wield.It is true, that nothing much of `excitement' happens in the film- no murders, car chases, explosions, steamy sex scenes. It follows an old couple, from the small town of Onomichi, on a long train trip to Tokyo to visit their grown children. Some have seen the film as a remake of Leo McCarey's 1937 Hollywood sudser, Make Way For Tomorrow, but Tokyo Story is to that film what Long Day's Journey Into Night is to The Bold & The Beautiful. There, the old couple see the town, are shunted aside, then return home. The mother dies, the children come to visit, and there are some revelations, but most of the living family members just return to their own patterns of life. Yet, having watched soap operas for many years, I can tell you this film soars well beyond soap operas, which rely on archetypes and stereotypes, and the most silly plot contrivances. Everything in this film happens as it would in reality. Plus, Ozu does not milk scenes for their overwrought emotions. In fact, he wields his edits like a rapier, and excises scenes that soap operas and more standard films would include. Tokyo Story is no shameless tearjerker.Ozu is the master of narrative ellipses. As example, we do not see an early emotional farewell scene between the parents and their youngest daughter Kyoko. We do not see the parents' first stay with their youngest son Keizo (Shiro Osaka), in Osaka, as they head toward Tokyo. Another technique he mastered is that of developing subplots, such as that of the widowed daughter-in-law, Noriko, who treats the old couple far better than all but one of their children. Yet, she is not hagiographized at the expense of the other children, even as they are not demonized for their lack of care for their parents. They are simply caring and selfish, as most people are to a certain degree.Tokyo Story is a great film, all the way around, but it was ignored for many years until it was re-released in New York in 1972, with the publication of Paul Schrader's Transcendental Style In Film. Twenty years later, in the 1992 Sight And Sound film critics poll, Tokyo Story was ranked as one of the ten greatest films ever made. In 2002 it repeated that feat. It is not a film that provides easy answers, and it lacks all the phony sentimentality and contrivances Hollywood films wallow in. It is not melodramatic in the least. When Shige, as example, bursts out in tears, when Koichi says their mother has not long to live, it is not Ozu's melodrama, but the character's own, and there is a huge difference in recognizing that. That the film so perfectly captured all the Japanese conventions of the era, yet still resonates with worldwide audiences, is the mark of a great work of art, and a testament to the great circularly narrative screenplay by Ozu and Kgo Noda, which deftly interweaves symbolism, such as train tracks and laundry, while capturing the way real people talk and react. Never is there a forced moment nor false reaction. The character building is superb, and the very relaxed and slow pace of the film shows what such a style can do. The film's score, by Kojun Saito is a tad over the top, at times, but understated far more often than not.If only Criterion had done their usual good job with this film the experience would have been perfect. But, don't let that deter any lover of great cinema from basking in one of the great films of all time. Tokyo Story makes its own leisurely way, but where it heads to is where all art desires to be.",5,Masterpiece,1221955200,"09 21, 2008",2008,4884,"['are', 'many', 'roads', 'greatness', 'notion', 'have', 'always', 'held', 'be', 'true', 'greater', 'example', 'could', 'be', 'given', 'comparing', 'films', 'two', 'greatest', 'filmmakers', 'Japan', 'course', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'heard', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'classics', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'Rashomon', 'Ikiru', 'also', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', '1903-1963', 'canon', 'films', 'set', 'modern', 'times', 'far', 'more', 'often', 'Kurosawa', 'Where', 'Kurosawa', 'was', 'grand', 'Ozu', 'small', 'Where', 'Kurosawa', 'was', 'kinetic', 'Ozu', 'was', 'static', 'Where', 'Kurosawa', 'celebrated', 'epic', 'Ozu', 'celebrated', 'ordinary', 'differences', 'greatest', 'films', 'are', 'indisputable', 'masterpieces', 'cinema', 'even', 'achieve', 'ends', 'seemingly', 'contradictory', 'ways.Perhaps', 'greatest', 'Ozu', 'films', '1953', 'black', 'white', 'classic', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'Tokyo', 'monogatari', 'simple', 'story', 'outline', 'unfolds', 'very', 'slowly', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'long', 'power', 'slow', 'accumulation', 'facts', 'deft', 'subtle', 'revelation', 'character', 'short', 'everything', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'produced', 'there', 'then', 'now', 'been', 'derided', 'being', 'stale', 'dull', 'plodding', 'even', 'alternately', 'been', 'chided', 'melodramatic', 'third', 'rate', 'soap', 'opera', 'Such', 'definitions', 'only', 'go', 'show', 'how', 'little', 'claimants', 'know', 'words', 'wield.It', 'true', 'nothing', 'much', 'excitement', 'happens', 'film-', 'murders', 'car', 'chases', 'explosions', 'steamy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'old', 'couple', 'small', 'town', 'Onomichi', 'long', 'train', 'trip', 'Tokyo', 'visit', 'grown', 'children', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'remake', 'Leo', 'McCarey', '1937', 'Hollywood', 'sudser', 'Make', 'Way', 'Tomorrow', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'film', 'what', 'Long', 'Day', 'Journey', 'Into', 'Night', 'Bold', 'Beautiful', 'old', 'couple', 'see', 'town', 'are', 'shunted', 'aside', 'then', 'return', 'home', 'mother', 'children', 'come', 'visit', 'are', 'revelations', 'most', 'living', 'family', 'members', 'just', 'return', 'own', 'patterns', 'life', 'having', 'watched', 'soap', 'operas', 'many', 'years', 'can', 'tell', 'film', 'well', 'soap', 'operas', 'rely', 'archetypes', 'stereotypes', 'most', 'silly', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'Everything', 'film', 'would', 'reality', 'Ozu', 'not', 'milk', 'scenes', 'overwrought', 'emotions', 'fact', 'edits', 'rapier', 'scenes', 'soap', 'operas', 'more', 'standard', 'films', 'would', 'include', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'shameless', 'tearjerker.Ozu', 'master', 'narrative', 'ellipses', 'example', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'early', 'emotional', 'farewell', 'scene', 'parents', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Kyoko', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'parents', 'first', 'stay', 'youngest', 'son', 'Keizo', 'Shiro', 'Osaka', 'Osaka', 'head', 'Tokyo', 'technique', 'mastered', 'developing', 'subplots', 'such', 'widowed', 'daughter-in-law', 'Noriko', 'who', 'old', 'couple', 'far', 'better', 'one', 'children', 'not', 'hagiographized', 'expense', 'other', 'children', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'demonized', 'lack', 'care', 'parents', 'are', 'simply', 'caring', 'selfish', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'certain', 'degree.Tokyo', 'Story', 'great', 'film', 'way', 'was', 'ignored', 'many', 'years', 'was', 're-released', 'New', 'York', '1972', 'publication', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'Transcendental', 'Style', 'Film', 'Twenty', 'years', 'later', '1992', 'Sight', 'Sound', 'film', 'critics', 'poll', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'was', 'ranked', 'one', 'ten', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', '2002', 'repeated', 'feat', 'not', 'film', 'easy', 'answers', 'phony', 'sentimentality', 'contrivances', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'wallow', 'not', 'melodramatic', 'least', 'When', 'Shige', 'example', 'out', 'tears', 'when', 'Koichi', 'mother', 'not', 'long', 'live', 'not', 'Ozu', 'melodrama', 'character', 'own', 'huge', 'difference', 'recognizing', 'film', 'so', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'Japanese', 'conventions', 'era', 'yet', 'still', 'worldwide', 'audiences', 'mark', 'great', 'work', 'art', 'testament', 'great', 'circularly', 'narrative', 'screenplay', 'Ozu', 'Kgo', 'Noda', 'deftly', 'symbolism', 'such', 'train', 'tracks', 'laundry', 'capturing', 'way', 'real', 'people', 'talk', 'react', 'Never', 'forced', 'moment', 'false', 'reaction', 'character', 'building', 'superb', 'very', 'relaxed', 'slow', 'pace', 'film', 'what', 'such', 'style', 'can', 'do', 'film', 'score', 'Kojun', 'Saito', 'tad', 'top', 'times', 'understated', 'far', 'more', 'often', 'not.If', 'only', 'Criterion', 'had', 'done', 'usual', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'experience', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'deter', 'lover', 'great', 'cinema', 'basking', 'one', 'great', 'films', 'time', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'own', 'leisurely', 'way', 'where', 'where', 'art', 'be']",N/A

493580,A30SO9E3K7WF75,B000006D1S,Dale Miller,"[2, 2]","One of Ozu's signature films, Tokyo Monogatari was released in 1953, and it provides a revealing glimpse of Tokyo in the fifties, only eight years after the end of the war, but already rebuilt into a teeming metropolis, where the Japanese wear Western dress for their daytime business activities and kimono at home.The contrast in clothing styles represents more than just comfort vs. convention, for Japan was undergoing a rapid transformation from a tradition-bound society to one influenced by western models of pragmatism and materialism, as the nation geared up for the ""economic miracle"" to come later.The story is a simple one: an elderly couple, Shukichi (Chishu Ryu) and Tomi (Chieko Higashiyama) travel from their rural village to Tokyo to visit their grown children, who are caught up in the bustle of urban postwar Japan, struggling to make a living, get ahead and raise their children. The eldest son Koichi (So Yamamura) is a pediatrician in a suburban clinic. We are given to understand that he is not as successful as his parents might have hoped. As the film opens, Koichi's wife Fumiko (Kuniko Miyake) scurries about preparing for her in-laws' visit, while her older son Minoru complains that his desk has been moved to make room for his grandparents to sleep. It is evident that the family routines are being disrupted by this incursion into their lives.We follow the old couple as they are shunted among their children, being passed along to their daughter Shige (Haruko Sugimura) who is married and runs a beauty salon. Again, their visit imposes on the busy lives of their daughter and her husband.The children do their best to entertain their parents, but there are continual conflicts, as when Koichi receives an emergency call from a patient on the day he is planning to take his parents sightseeing. Later they all go on a tour bus to see the sights of Tokyo. But the children eventually decide to send their parents away to the nearby resort town of Atami for a few days to be rid of them. The old couple enjoy the hot baths and the scenery, but at night when they try to sleep they are kept awake by the singing and partying of other guests at the inn. Shukichi remarks resignedly: ""This is a place for the younger generation."" They return to Tokyo early, to the discomfiture of their children. Shige has plans to entertain clients, so there is no place for the grandparents to stay.In a rather desperate move, they decide that Tomi can stay with Noriko (Setsuko Hara), the widow of their middle son, killed in the war, who is an independent working woman. Shukichi goes to visit an old friend from his village, they call on a third and the three of them get roaring drunk. Shukichi and one of his cronies are then delivered to the home of Shige and her husband by an officer from the koban (police box), to their great displeasure.While the two men sleep off their drunk at Shige's, Tomi has a heart-to-heart talk with her son's widow Noriko, who treats her better than her own children do. This scene is played with exquiste tenderness by Setsuko Hara as Noriko. It is easy to understand her enormous popularity with Japanese filmgoers.At last the old couple decide to return home, stopping at Osaka to visit their other son. Tomi falls ill during the train ride, and when they have reached their native village, the Tokyo children receive telegrams informing them that their mother is in grave condition. They leave immediately and arrive just before she dies.The rest of the film shows them in mourning, expressing their regrets for not being more attentive while their mother was alive, before their attention turns once again to their busy lives. There is a sense of fatalism: a generation swept up by postwar modernization and the transformation of Japanese society finds itself unable to maintain a grasp on tradition.This simple tale is handled with extraordinary delicacy. Two of the director's favorite actors, Chishu Ryu and actress Setsuko Hara, deliver eloquent performances that are not in the least maudlin.Shot in black and white in Ozu's distinctive, almost minimalist cinematographic style, Tokyo Story captures the postwar zeitgeist of a nation caught inexorably in the throes of change.

When good-natured parents leave their village to visit their grown children in the big city, it's easy to feel contempt when the parents are shuffled-off to a spa. Yet Ozu does not create villains. He also shows the goodness in these flawed characters. The children have eaked out a survival in Tokyo by struggling through the lean years after the war, which accounts in part for their callousness. Yet Ozu does not excuse their human failure, he is more interested in portraying them for the viewer to observe and be inspired.

I had heard of Yasujiro Ozu's ""Tokyo Story"" for several years but never had an opportunity to see it until Criterion resuscitated it as part of their DVD collection. Over fifty years old, this wondrous 1953 film resonates just as deeply today. Those outside Japan rarely get to see a Japanese film classic that doesn't involve samurai warriors in medieval battles. This one, however, is a subtly observed family drama set in post-WWII Japan, and it is the quietude and lack of pretense of Ozu's filmmaking style that makes this among the most moving of films. The plot centers on Shukishi and Tomi, an elderly couple, who traverse the country from their southern fishing village of Onomichi to visit their adult children, daughter Shige and son Koichi, in Tokyo. Leading their own busy lives, the children realize their obligation to entertain them and pack them off to Atami, a nearby resort targeted to weekend revelers. Returning to Tokyo unexpectedly, Tomi visits their kindly daughter-in-law, Noriko, the widow of second son Shoji, while Shukishi gets drunk with some old companions.The old couple realizes they have become a burden to their children and decide to return to Onomichi. They also have a younger daughter Kyoko, a schoolteacher who lives with them, and younger son Keizo works for the train company in Osaka. By now the children, except for Kyoko and the dutiful Noriko, have given up on their parents, even when Tomi takes ill in Osaka on the way back home. From this seemingly convoluted, trivial-sounding storyline, fraught with soap opera possibilities, Ozu has fashioned a heartfelt and ultimately ironic film that focuses on the details in people's lives rather than a single dramatic situation. What fascinates me about Ozu's idiosyncratic style is how he relies on insinuation to carry his story forward. In fact, some of the more critical events happen off-camera because Ozu's simple, penetrating observations of these characters' lives remain powerfully insightful without being contrived. Ozu scholar David Desser, who provides insightful commentary on the alternate audio track, explains this concept as ""narrative ellipses"", Ozu's singularly effective means of providing emotional continuity to a story without providing all the predictable detail in between.Ozu also positions his camera low throughout his film to replicate the perspective of someone sitting on a tatami mat. It adds significantly to the humanity he evokes. There are no melodramatic confrontations among the characters, no masochistic showboating, and the dialogue is deceptively casual, as even the most off-hand remark bears weight into the story. The film condemns no one and its sense of inevitability carries with it only certain resigned sadness. What amazes me most is how the ending is so cathartic because the characters feel so real to me, not because there are manipulative plot developments, even death, which force me to feel for them. I just love the performances, as they have a neo-realism that makes them all the more affecting. Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama are wonderfully authentic as Shukishi and Tomi, perfectly conveying the resignation they feel about their lives and their children without slipping into cheap sentimentality. Higashiyama effortlessly displays the sunny demeanor of a grandmother, so when sadness does take over in her life, it becomes all the more haunting.In particular, she has a beautiful scene where Tomi looks forlornly at her grandchild wondering what he will be when he grows up and whether she will live to see what happens. Even more heartbreaking is the scene where Shukishi and Tomi sit in Ueno Park realizing their children have no time for them and are resigned to the fact that they need to find a place to sleep for the night. The closest the film has to a villain is Shige, portrayed fearlessly by Haruko Sugimura, who is able to show respect, pettiness and conniving in a realistically mercurial fashion. Watch her as she complains about the expensive cakes her husband bought for her parents (as she selfishly eats them herself) or how she finagles Koichi to co-finance the trip to Atami or how she shows her frustration when her parents come home early from the spa. So Yamamura (familiar to later Western audiences as Admiral Yamamoto inTora! Tora! Tora!) displays the right amount of indifference as Koichi, and Kyoko Kagawa has a few sharp lines toward the end of the film as the disappointed Kyoko.However, the best performance comes from the legendary Setsuko Hara, a luminous actress whose beauty and sensitivity remind me of Olivia de Havilland during the same era. As Noriko, she is breathtaking in showing her character's modesty, her unforced generosity in spite of her downscale status and her constant smile as a mask for her pain. She has a number of deeply affecting moments, for instance, when Noriko explains to Shukishi and Tomi how she misses her husband, even though it is implied he was a brutalizing alcoholic; or the touching goodbye to Kyoko; or her pained embarrassment over the high esteem that Shukishi holds for her kindness. Don't expect fireworks or any shocking moments, just a powerfully emotional film in spite of its seemingly modest approach. The two-disc DVD set has the commentary from Desser on the first disc, as well as the trailer. On the second disc, there are two excellent documentaries. One is a comprehensive 1983, two-hour feature focused on Ozu's life and career, and the second is a 40-minute tribute from several international movie directors.",5,Ozu's Quietly Brilliant Masterpiece

493585,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B000006D1S,Ernest Jagger,"[8, 8]","Yasujiro Ozu, known for his earlier works of cinema, ""Late Spring"" and ""Early Summer"" gave us a film which I consider his greatest masterpiece, ""Tokyo Story."" Aside from the notable cinematic expression of the camera work that Ozu was known for in his films; such as the low camera angles, what makes this masterpiece so profound to me is the simplicity of the film itself. And although his earlier aforementioned works also deal with simple themes, this film for me captures and encapsulates where the two previous films leave off: The impermanence of life. Many people I know have stated that this film is sterile and cold, and that it has no soul.I tend to disagree. Yes, the film gives the viewer the simple life of a family. [A common theme in Ozu's films] However, unlike his earlier films, the impermanence of life is given full force in this film. Here we see a family that must come to turns with what we must all inevitably face in our own lives: The death of a loved one. And Ozu does not do this in the typical American fashion, but instead focuses on the long drawn out lives of this family in a soap opera like narrative, just as he did in ""Late Spring"" and ""Early Summer.""The film itself takes place in post-war Japan. And as with most of the films of Yasujiro Ozu, there are the usual Ozu cast of actors. We have the mother Tomi (Chieko Higashiyama) and father Shukishi (Chishu Ryu). Living in the rural countryside, they decide to visit their children who reside in Tokyo. However, the children are indifferent to their parents visiting them and decide to send them away to a spa. Another Ozu regular: the beautiful Noriko, (Setsuko Hara) portrays the widowed daughter-in-law of Tomi and Shukishi. And it is Noriko who treats the elder Hirayama's with more compassion and love than their own children. It is not that the children are intentionally spiteful to their parents, they just feel as if a great burden is being placed on them by their parents visit.This film is a simple, yet great masterpiece, weaving a story of the usual day to day activities of life, which will eventually create a tapestry of the cycle of life itself, when one of the parents becomes ill and dies. This impermanence of life that Ozu shows us is done by letting us glimpse the normal day to day life of both the children [now adults] and the parents who are now in old age. And this is what makes this film so great. We are given a snapshot of life, and yet the way Ozu is able to present the film makes the film much more profound and poignant than any American film-maker has ever done: For Ozu does not cop-out with a happy ending.I first saw this film with my father in the early 1970's at the now defunct Fox Theater in Venice, California. I was much younger then, and the film did not resonate with me at the time. Now that I am older, and wiser, I realized why my father loved this film so much. [He died in 1978]. And whenever I view this film, it reminds me of him. When I watched the film again last night, I realized why my father loved this film as much as he did---it is a film that will move you deeply and emotionally. The film is both profound and sad. The children who feel inconvenienced by their parents later feel remorse when their mother Tomi is gravely ill.It is only then that the children pay heed to her and rush back to their parents village to grieve for their mother Tomi. The children now truly realize how indifferent and non-emotional they were to their parents needs. This film is often referred to as a film about generational conflicts which in itself are universal and timeless. More importantly however, is that ""Tokyo Story"" allows us look at our own lives, and see our we relate to our loved ones here and now. I highly recommend this great film to everyone.

493586,AZFU9VPJ0JX4,B000006D1S,"Francis G. Lu ""Emeritus Luke & Grace Kim Endo...","[1, 1]","""Tokyo Story"" (1953) by Yasujiro Ozu is about the serene acceptance of the transience of life through a contemplative, compassionate love of the now. Perhaps inspired by the 1937 American filmMake Way for Tomorrow (Criterion Collection), Ozu crafts a film that utilizes Japanese aesthetic sensibilities which resonate at the same time with universal themes beginning concretely with family life among 3 generations in early 1950s Japan that then open out and blossom forth to encompass the transcendent mystery in the most immanent of things. One is reminded of William Blake's lines from the ""Auguries of Innocence"": ""To see a world in a grain of sand, And a heaven in a wild flower; Hold infinity in the palm of your hand, And an eternity in an hour."" Ozu is widely seen by critics worldwide as one of the great Japanese directors along with Kurosawa and Mizoguchi, and this film as his greatest among the 54 films that he made from 1927 to his 1962An Autumn Afternoon - Criterion Collection. Two other Ozu classics areLate Spring - Criterion Collectionand the 1959Stories of Floating Weeds (A Story of Floating Weeds (1934) / Floating Weeds (1959)) - Criterion Collection;the latter has Roger Ebert speaking his cogent, insightful audio commentary--Wow!  Donald Richie, who was a pioneer in bringing Ozu and Kurosawa to the attention of the West, has writtenOzu: His Life and Filmsas well as translated the screenplay ofTokyo Story: The Ozu/Noda Screenplay. David Desser has edited a wonderful collection of essays aboutOzu's Tokyo Story (Cambridge Film Handbooks), and Paul Schrader's 1972Transcendental Style In Film (Da Capo Paperback)about Ozu, Robert Bresson, and Carl Dreyer continues to show us the value of a contemplative ""transcendental style"" of filmmaking that is all too rarely seen in films of today.""Tokyo Story"" is my 2nd favorite film after Kurosawa'sIkiru - Criterion Collection. We are indeed most fortunate that since 2003 the Criterion Collection not only has restored all of the films mentioned in this review onto DVD, but also has included insightful written essays, audio commentaries, and bonus films with the DVDs.

It was made 50 years ago in Japan, about people who lived far away, but it is also about all of us, our families, our problems, our guilt and our search for love and meaning.Ozu's film does not require one to be a movie buff or to try to solve complex symbolism to appreciate and love it. It brings smiles because it is a comedy (for at least the first 2/3) and sadness with a high drama of the last 1/3 of the film.Yasujiro Ozu's quiet and deceptively simple film tells a story of an elderly couple who travel to Tokyo to see their grown up children and their families - son, daughter and daughter-in-law who is a widow of their middle son that was killed during the World War II. Their children love them, of course but they are too busy with their own lives and jobs to spend much time with them. Their young grandchildren don't know them and not too eager to try to know their grandparents better. Only the widowed daughter-in-law is the one who is really happy with their arrival and tries to make their visit pleasurable. After parents return home, children receive a telegram with the sad news that the mother became critically ill. Now it is their turn to make a journey.Ozu does not judge anybody, but beneath the quiet politeness, smiles, and soft voices there is a sad, inevitable, and powerful alienation of generations in the modern world of big cities.

His movies are slow-moving compared to films often described as slow-moving. Scenes are so mundane that a new viewer will think he watching a webcam broadcast of some Japanese living room rather than a movie. The drama generally comprises little disturbances of everyday life.This film, considered by many his masterpiece, is not so subtle. It reminds me more of a fairy tale with wicked step-sisters of a virtuous young beauty. Here, the step-sisters are a man and his sister who are inconvenienced by their aged parents visiting them in Tokyo.

493594,A106016KSI0YQ,B000006D1S,Jay Dickson,"[43, 43]","Often voted one of the greatest films of all time, Yasujiro Ozu's most famous film (made in 1953, but not released in the US until years later) follows an elderly couple as they leave their seaside town where they live with their youngest daughter, Kyoko, to visit their two eldest surviving children, Shige and Koichi, in Tokyo, stopping to meet their youngest son, Keizo, in Osaka along the way. Although their children seem to mean well, they are greatly inconvenienced by their parents' visit and do not take time off from work to show them around the city, instead asking their widowed sister-in-law Noriko to squire them about instead; Koichi's young sons treat his grandparents with sullen rudeness. Finally, Shige and Koichi dump their parents off at a hot springs resort not far from Tokyo, where the elderly couple feel out of place. On their return by train home, the mother becomes mortally ill, and the grief-stricken children and Noriko must come bury their mother and must face up to or ignore their previous treatment of her and their father.Ozu considered his film a melodrama because it dealt more straightforwardly with life's tragedies and with grief than his other family dramas from his famed later period do. The film suggests a fairy tale, or King Lear, in that we, like the elderly couple, are positioned to judge the children and Noriko according to who is least and most filial; yet Ozu requires we see the selfishness of the children and the neglect of the parents in more complex terms. (Though this seems beyond the DVD's commentator, David Desser, whose intelligent technical shot-by-shot analysis of the film seems seriously marred by his willingness to engage in simplistic moral judgements of the characters.) Certainly the film is a commentary on human selfishness and the dangers of familial dispersal in an era of alienating modernity after the second World War (when Tokyo, the film's locus for modernity, has been rebuilt almost from the ground up). Yet the film celebrates the new Tokyo as much as it condemns it, and the couple admits to themselves that though their children are not as nice as they remembered, they are happy they are busy and can care for themselves. And the most selfless member of the younger generation Noriko (played by the great Japanese actress Setsuko Hara) points out to the stay-at-home Kyoko that while her siblings appear selfish they have their own lives to lead now that they are in middle age and their own families to care for. And Shige, who seems the most monstrously selfish and hypocritical of the children, seems to have some reasons for resenting her parents: some ridiculous (being embarrassed by her mother's weight as a child when she broke a chair she was sitting in), and others more pointed (her father's tendency to drink heavily before the birth of Kyoko). Ozu is too intelligent and humane to cast this story in terms fo Manichaean opposities; indeed, just as he seems at times to deplore Tokyo's sprawl and industrial quality, he also has the parents and Nariko take a guided bus tour of the city and shows off the city's ability to have bounced back after its Allied war bombing. One of the greatest pleasures of the film are its superb framed compositions, especially in his transitional sequences where he shows us empty rooms, as if to emphasize the transitory nature of human life and family affairs.",5,"""None can serve his parents beyond the grave""",1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,3396,"['Often', 'voted', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'time', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'most', 'famous', 'film', 'made', '1953', 'not', 'released', 'US', 'years', 'later', 'elderly', 'couple', 'leave', 'seaside', 'town', 'where', 'live', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Kyoko', 'visit', 'two', 'eldest', 'surviving', 'children', 'Shige', 'Koichi', 'Tokyo', 'stopping', 'meet', 'youngest', 'son', 'Keizo', 'Osaka', 'way', 'children', 'seem', 'mean', 'well', 'are', 'greatly', 'inconvenienced', 'parents', 'visit', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'time', 'work', 'show', 'around', 'city', 'instead', 'asking', 'widowed', 'sister-in-law', 'Noriko', 'squire', 'instead', 'Koichi', 'young', 'sons', 'treat', 'grandparents', 'sullen', 'rudeness', 'Finally', 'Shige', 'Koichi', 'dump', 'parents', 'off', 'hot', 'springs', 'resort', 'not', 'far', 'Tokyo', 'where', 'elderly', 'couple', 'feel', 'place', 'return', 'train', 'home', 'mother', 'mortally', 'ill', 'grief-stricken', 'children', 'Noriko', 'must', 'come', 'bury', 'mother', 'must', 'face', 'up', 'ignore', 'previous', 'treatment', 'father.Ozu', 'considered', 'film', 'melodrama', 'more', 'straightforwardly', 'life', 'tragedies', 'grief', 'other', 'family', 'dramas', 'famed', 'later', 'period', 'do', 'film', 'fairy', 'tale', 'King', 'Lear', 'elderly', 'couple', 'are', 'positioned', 'judge', 'children', 'Noriko', 'according', 'who', 'least', 'most', 'filial', 'yet', 'Ozu', 'see', 'selfishness', 'children', 'neglect', 'parents', 'more', 'complex', 'terms', 'DVD', 'commentator', 'David', 'Desser', 'intelligent', 'technical', 'shot-by-shot', 'analysis', 'film', 'seriously', 'marred', 'willingness', 'engage', 'simplistic', 'moral', 'judgements', 'characters', 'Certainly', 'film', 'commentary', 'human', 'selfishness', 'dangers', 'familial', 'dispersal', 'era', 'alienating', 'modernity', 'second', 'World', 'War', 'when', 'Tokyo', 'film', 'locus', 'modernity', 'been', 'rebuilt', 'almost', 'ground', 'up', 'film', 'new', 'Tokyo', 'as', 'much', 'couple', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'nice', 'remembered', 'are', 'happy', 'are', 'busy', 'can', 'care', 'most', 'selfless', 'member', 'younger', 'generation', 'Noriko', 'played', 'great', 'Japanese', 'actress', 'Setsuko', 'Hara', 'out', 'stay-at-home', 'Kyoko', 'siblings', 'appear', 'selfish', 'have', 'own', 'lives', 'lead', 'now', 'are', 'middle', 'age', 'own', 'families', 'care', 'Shige', 'who', 'most', 'monstrously', 'selfish', 'hypocritical', 'children', 'have', 'reasons', 'resenting', 'parents', 'ridiculous', 'being', 'embarrassed', 'mother', 'weight', 'child', 'when', 'broke', 'chair', 'was', 'sitting', 'others', 'more', 'pointed', 'father', 'tendency', 'drink', 'heavily', 'birth', 'Kyoko', 'Ozu', 'too', 'intelligent', 'humane', 'cast', 'story', 'terms', 'fo', 'Manichaean', 'opposities', 'indeed', 'just', 'times', 'deplore', 'Tokyo', 'sprawl', 'industrial', 'quality', 'also', 'parents', 'Nariko', 'take', 'guided', 'bus', 'tour', 'city', 'city', 'ability', 'have', 'bounced', 'back', 'Allied', 'war', 'bombing', 'One', 'greatest', 'pleasures', 'film', 'are', 'superb', 'framed', 'compositions', 'especially', 'transitional', 'sequences', 'where', 'empty', 'rooms', 'emphasize', 'transitory', 'nature', 'human', 'life', 'family', 'affairs']",N/A

It's hard to imagine why.The story is immediately engrossing and keeps you rivetted from start to finish. It's not Seven Samurai or Yojimbo, but a simple tale of an elderly couple travelling to Tokyo to see their children. What results is disappointment and resentment masked by plastic smiles , false pleasantries and rigid formality. The parents are disappointed in the children, and the children resent the parents. There are no intense moments of melodrama or intriguing plot twists to entertain the viewer. Worlds of pain and suffering are revealed through a few words here or there, or through subtle body language.The film is beautifully photographed with a minimal amount of camera movement (if there is any at all), and is well preserved by Criterion. It may not be the best restoration ever, but it's superior to the infamous Ran transfers, and hardly noticeable when the film carries you away.The entire cast is wonderful, varying from polite inoffensive formality of the elderly couple, the businesslike, obligatory courtesy of the children, and carefree lack of pretentiousness of the grandchildren. The characters are so realistic that you may be reminded of friends or family. Standing out are Chishu Ryu as the father and Setsuko Hara as the widow of Ryu's deceased son. Hara spends most of her film time bearing the most artificial and forced smiles, almost annoyingly, until the end with her scene with Ryu in which years of concealed heartbreak finally come to the surface. It is simple to the point of understatement, and quite memorable.Ozu, one of the most neglected artists in the West, shows himself here to be one of the great directors of all time in this universal tale of deception and honesty.

Only problem is, their kids live in tiny crowded homes and are not on vacation. This leads to the parents being unceremoniously routed from one child to the next because nobody has the time to entertain them. As it turns out, the child who is nicest to them is the daughter-in-law, wife of their dead son, who we presume died in the war. When the grandma dies unexpectedly, the children are  very concerned about grabbing her possessions. I assume the director is trying to make a statement about the elderly not getting the respect and the compassion that they enjoyed in the pre-war era, but I can't say for sure since this is outside of my culture.This film was shot in black & white. Sometimes black & white has a wonderfully velvety and mysterious quality and sometimes it simply looks harsh. In this picture it comes across as harsh.

Plotwise, Ozu offers more a scenario than an actual story: two elderly parents go to Tokyo to visit their children, who do not necessarily welcome them warmly. From that simple scenario, though, Ozu creates scenes that say so little and yet say so much about familial relations. That is the power of his minimalist style: a lot is left unsaid among the characters, but many things are implied, and of course it is left to the viewer to pick up on the implications and perhaps reflect on them. (The parents' children, for example, all feel exasperation at what they see as their burden when their parents arrive, but only Noriko, the widow of one of their dead sons, is truly nice to them. Obviously that says something about the others...)Watching TOKYO STORY, I felt like I was in the presence of a wise old man who I felt could teach me, in his own silent way, a lot of things about life, especially when I eventually grow up (I am only eighteen myself) and perhaps run into these same situations that Ozu illustrates in this film. Perhaps people might react differently to this film---older people might identify with the situations, while younger ones might react in a more objective but fascinated manner. Either way, I don't think anyone who chances upon this wonderful film will not be moved in some way. What you see with every shot and every image in TOKYO STORY is life---plain and simple.

493601,A1U6B2LDK3BUVU,B000006D1S,"LF ""Keep your feedback to yourself, these are...","[9, 14]","An elderly rural Japanese couple visits Tokyo to spend some time with their children.  The film isn't always clear about 'who is who', so I will clarify it for you.  There are two daughters - the domineering and selfish married one Shige, and the young girl who still lives with her parents in the country, Kyoko.  The couple had three sons.  Koichi is a doctor, but in a society in which doctors were not wealthy as they are today.  Keiki (or whatever his name is) is a young railroad employee who doesn't live in Tokyo and is single.  The other son died in the war, but his widow Noriko plays a prominent role in the film.  The elderly couple is Shukishi and his wife Tomi.There are also two grandchildren in the film, the young sons of Koichi and his wife Fumiko or something.  The pre-teen throws a bit of a tantrum, and the little boy is cute but ignores his grandparents.The story is a little reminiscent of King Lear.  The children don't want to be bothered by their parents even though they haven't seen them in many years and will never see them again.  They don't behave cruelly to their parents, but they do behave selfishly and thoughtlessly.  One gets the feeling that if there was anything to gain, if these parents had a kingdom to give as Lear did, the children would have resorted to cruelty to get it.An example of Shige's nastiness is when she criticizes her husband for buying little pastries for her parents because the pastries are ""too good for them"", and then starts to eat them herself.  That's a beauty, isn't it.Shige finds ways to criticize and dominate the others in the story, including her parents.  I notice that the only character who puts her in her place is her mellow, pleasant father.  When Shige criticizes him for drinking a cup of sake, he orders her not to worry about it, and ignores and defies her, which shuts her up.  Her own husband is henpecked by her.Balancing out Shige's nastiness and cheapness, there is Noriko, not even a blood relative, the widow of the dead son.  She is the only one who truly cares for the parents, particularly for Tomi.  When the other children are finding ways to get the parents out of their house, Noriko is thrilled to have the opportunity to take them around Tokyo.The movie doesn't say so, but I suspect that Noriko is so drawn to the elderly couple because she loved their son so much, and it is her way of continuing to love him, to be kind to his parents and to actually have them with her, since she can't have him with her.  I could see someone being very excited to be with the parents of a lost love, and fawning on them.The Japanese people in this film talk in conventions, say the correct thing, the polite thing, the expected thing.  It seems frustrating to an American to hear all this nonsense, all of these cliches, all the false modesty and so on, that epitomize Japanese conversation.  Shige is good at it, and she is as phony as a four dollar bill.  She is the one who busts out crying when she is ""supposed to"", when the more honest characters, the ones who actually feel sad, do not.The father very definitely uses this convention as well.  But in his hands, it is a way to smooth difficulties over.  There is some artistry and some usefulness in the way he uses conventions to get through difficult situations without rancor.One theme of the film is the thoughtlessness and selfishness of children.  I think it is a valid point.  Once a child enters, or even approaches, the teen years, the parents often become little more than financial providers.  Dad, give me a car.  Dad, I need money.  That's about it.  Babies love their parents, but grown children often don't really care about them except for what they can get out of them, which of course they don't appreciate, since they are entitled to whatever they want, and the parents are not entitled to a thing.This story didn't take it in exactly that direction, because the parents don't have anything to give.  So the kids just ignore them and get rid of them.There is an interesting scene at the end when the father is praising Noriko for her generosity and love.  He is, of course, a very sharp man.  Noriko denies that she has those good qualities.  She isn't being falsely modest.  She is admitting that she has her dark side, which she hasn't shown.  So the father praises her for her honesty, and continues to disagree with her about her character.  He understands what she's saying.  He just interprets her differently than she does.There is a poignant line in that conversation.  Noriko says that she doesn't think of his son every day.  Sometimes a few days will pass in her life when she doesn't think of him.  The father says that he hopes she will forget his son and remarry.  The touching thing is that even if a day goes by when she doesn't think of her former husband, not too many days in a row go by without her loving thoughts of him.The commentary is informative but I found it disconcerting that the speaker sometimes says ""Noriko"" but more often says ""Nordico"".  I realize that the R in Japanese can be said like a D, but it will not be pronounced like an RD, and he really should have made up his mind which way to say it.  Since his Japanese accent is atrocious, he should have stuck with Noriko.This is a good enough film to warrant you seeing it twice as I did, once as performed, and once listening to the commentary and trying to ignore all those ""Nordico's"".  But you can't now, since I brought them to your attention.",4,The selfishness of children,1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,5500,"['elderly', 'rural', 'Japanese', 'couple', 'visits', 'Tokyo', 'spend',

493602,A3TRXPRUYVOLSM,B000006D1S,Little Roy Blue,"[1, 1]","Since I was raised in the 1980s - an era of glitzy Hollywood action movies - it took me a long time to appreciate the subtler joys of foreign films. Fortunately, I discovered the Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu about 10 years ago; his work appealed to me instantly, and provided a good entry point into serious cinema. I haven't looked back since...""Tokyo Story"" is the most critically acclaimed of Ozu's films. The simple (on the surface) plot involves an aging couple who visit their adult children in Tokyo and Osaka, only to find themselves neglected and mistreated by their ungrateful offspring. Though the situation has much potential for melodrama, Ozu downplays the histrionics; emotion is expressed subtly, through simple statements and pained facial expressions rather than long speeches or egregious overacting. To me, Ozu's restraint is a welcome counter to the tendency of movies to over-dramatize life. The result is a film that is much truer to my experience of life than typical Hollywood fare, or indeed typical European or Asian cinema.That said, this is actually one of Ozu's least subtle films; the director himself called it ""melodramatic,"" though his standards are quite different from ours. There is a clear message here that children should be kinder to their parents. There is also a clear ""good guy"" (Noriko, who treats the old parents with respect) and a ""bad guy"" (Shige, who treats the parents poorly). Fortunately, there is some nuance to these characters - Noriko is arguably nice to the parents only because she is quite lonely herself, and has the time and inclination to indulge them. But my point is that critics may be wrong in labeling this as Ozu's best film, since it lacks the subtler, morally hazy approach of films like ""Late Spring,"" ""Floating Weeds,"" and ""An Autumn Afternoon,"" all of which are masterpieces in their own right.Still, ""Tokyo Story"" is a great film, and I'm always pleased when it gets ranked among the best films ever made. It's certainly worthier of such an honor than many other films that are considered classics.Naturally, the Criterion Collection tried to do justice to this highly regarded film, and for the most part I quite like their two-disc DVD edition. The print of the film itself is pretty good, given the age and origin of the material (compare the print of 1954's ""Godzilla,"" which is a scratched-up mess). Meanwhile, the scholarly commentary by David Desser is hit-or-miss; though he has some valuable insights to offer, he also has an irksome tendency to simply explain what's happening on screen. More interesting, to me, are the two documentary features included on Disc Two: ""I Lived, But..."" (a superb two-hour portrait of Ozu's life and work) and ""Talking with Ozu"" (a slightly less superb documentary in which various directors describe their personal reactions to Ozu's films). Overall, it's a good DVD package for a great film that deserves a much wider audience in the U.S.",5,A classic that deserves its status,1298419200,"02 23, 2011",2011,2959,"['was', 'raised', '1980s', 'era', 'glitzy', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'movies', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'appreciate', 'subtler', 'joys', 'foreign', 'films', 'Fortunately', 'discovered', 'Japanese', 'director', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'work', 'appealed', 'instantly', 'provided', 'good', 'entry', 'point', 'serious', 'cinema', 'have', ""n't"", 'looked', 'back', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'most', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Ozu', 'films', 'simple', 'surface', 'plot', 'aging', 'couple', 'who', 'visit', 'adult', 'children', 'Tokyo', 'Osaka', 'only', 'find', 'neglected', 'mistreated', 'ungrateful', 'offspring', 'situation', 'much', 'potential', 'melodrama', 'Ozu', 'histrionics', 'emotion', 'expressed', 'subtly', 'simple', 'statements', 'pained', 'facial', 'expressions', 'rather', 'long', 'speeches', 'egregious', 'overacting', 'Ozu', 'restraint', 'welcome', 'counter', 'tendency', 'movies', 'over-dramatize', 'life', 'result', 'film', 'much', 'truer', 'experience', 'life', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'indeed', 'typical', 'European', 'Asian', 'cinema.That', 'said', 'actually', 'one', 'Ozu', 'least', 'subtle', 'films', 'director', 'called', 'melodramatic', 'standards', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'ours', 'clear', 'message', 'here', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'kinder', 'parents', 'also', 'clear', 'good', 'guy', 'Noriko', 'who', 'old', 'parents', 'respect', 'bad', 'guy', 'Shige', 'who', 'parents', 'poorly', 'Fortunately', 'nuance', 'characters', 'Noriko', 'arguably', 'nice', 'parents', 'only', 'quite', 'lonely', 'time', 'inclination', 'indulge', 'point', 'critics', 'may', 'be', 'wrong', 'labeling', 'Ozu', 'best', 'film', 'subtler', 'morally', 'hazy', 'approach', 'films', 'Late', 'Spring', 'Floating', 'Weeds', 'Autumn', 'Afternoon', 'are', 'masterpieces', 'own', 'right.Still', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'great', 'film', ""'m"", 'always', 'pleased', 'when', 'ranked', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'certainly', 'worthier', 'such', 'honor', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'considered', 'classics.Naturally', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'tried', 'do', 'justice', 'highly', 'regarded', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'quite', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'edition', 'print', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'given', 'age', 'origin', 'material', 'compare', 'print', '1954', 'Godzilla', 'scratched-up', 'mess', 'Meanwhile', 'scholarly', 'commentary', 'David', 'Desser', 'hit-or-miss', 'valuable', 'insights', 'offer', 'also', 'irksome', 'tendency', 'simply', 'explain', 'what', 'happening', 'screen', 'More', 'interesting', 'are', 'two', 'documentary', 'features', 'included', 'Disc', 'Two', 'Lived', 'superb', 'two-hour', 'portrait', 'Ozu', 'life', 'work', 'Talking', 'Ozu', 'slightly', 'less', 'superb', 'documentary', 'various', 'directors', 'describe', 'personal', 'reactions', 'Ozu', 'films', 'Overall', 'good', 'DVD', 'package', 'great', 'film', 'much', 'wider', 'audience', 'U.S']",N/A
493603,A1MZ86B59GZDOG,B000006D1S,LVLMLeah,"[14, 14]","As someone who works with the elderly I see the sad truth of Tokyo Monogatari played out over and over and over again on a daily basis. Director Ozu tells us in a raw and naked way what is truly a heart breaking story, the stark reality of parent/child relationships through generational life cycles and the gaps that are created. But he tells it in a non apologetic or biased voice. It is what it is, good or bad; it's part of the human condition.It's the story of an elderly couple who go to visit with their children, whom they rarely see, but find that the children are too busy to be with them making all kinds of unimportant excuses as to why. While this story is age old and relevant, even more so more than 50 years later, Ozu doesn't go for dramatic tactics to rip at our hearts, but in typical Japanese fashion he says so much with restrained expression and simplistic language. Every one, except for the daughter who openly shows her irritation at having to deal with her parents, is smiling all the time, even though their eyes and body language tell a different story. We feel uncomfortable as we watch them all sitting around trying to make polite conversation and not knowing really how to be.Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama play the elderly father and mother so well that we cannot understand how the children cannot bring themselves to sacrifice even a small amount of time to be with them, much less revere them. This film does make us question our own beliefs and actions in how we treat our elders and also how we only briefly reflect on what's important only after it's too late.  However, Ozu manages to draw our attention to all sides of the story and we can see that familial relationships are more complex than just the black and white of we should respect our elders or love our children no matter how they turn out, or we are evil, bad people.The one bright spot in this whole film, and one that gives us all hope that there are truly good, decent people out there in the universe who do the right thing no matter what cost to themselves is the daughter-in-law, who is so beautifully played by Setsuko Hara. And she truly loves the parents even though they are not her blood relatives, while feeling guilty for slowly forgetting their dead son, her husband.Bottom line, this is a very poignant and sadly beautiful film that touches the heart deeply on so many levels and it's worth watching for the simple, yet intense, portrayal of it all.",5,Sad but true...,1189382400,"09 10, 2007",2007,2469,"['someone', 'who', 'elderly', 'see', 'sad', 'truth', 'Tokyo', 'Monogatari', 'played', 'out', 'over', 'again', 'daily', 'basis', 'Director', 'Ozu', 'raw', 'naked', 'way', 'what', 'truly', 'heart', 'breaking', 'story', 'stark', 'reality', 'parent/child', 'relationships', 'generational', 'life', 'cycles', 'gaps', 'are', 'created', 'non', 'apologetic', 'biased', 'voice', 'what', 'good', 'bad', 'part', 'human', 'condition.It', 'story', 'elderly', 'couple', 'who', 'go', 'visit', 'children', 'whom', 'rarely', 'see', 'find', 'children', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'be', 'making', 'kinds', 'unimportant', 'excuses', 'why', 'story', 'age', 'old', 'relevant', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'more', '50', 'years', 'later', 'Ozu', ""n't"", 'go', 'dramatic', 'tactics', 'rip', 'hearts', 'typical', 'Japanese', 'fashion', 'so', 'much', 'restrained', 'expression', 'simplistic', 'language', 'one', 'daughter', 'who', 'openly', 'irritation', 'having', 'deal', 'parents', 'smiling', 'time', 'even', 'eyes', 'body', 'language', 'tell', 'different', 'story', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'sitting', 'around', 'trying', 'make', 'polite', 'conversation', 'not', 'knowing', 'really', 'how', 'be.Chishu', 'Ryu', 'Chieko', 'Higashiyama', 'play', 'elderly', 'father', 'mother', 'so', 'well', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'children', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'sacrifice', 'even', 'small', 'amount', 'time', 'be', 'much', 'less', 'revere', 'film', 'make', 'question', 'own', 'beliefs', 'actions', 'how', 'treat', 'elders', 'also', 'how', 'only', 'briefly', 'reflect', 'what', 'important', 'only', 'too', 'late', 'However', 'Ozu', 'draw', 'attention', 'sides', 'story', 'can', 'see', 'familial', 'relationships', 'are', 'more', 'complex', 'just', 'black', 'white', 'should', 'respect', 'elders', 'love', 'children', 'matter', 'how', 'turn', 'out', 'are', 'evil', 'bad', 'people.The', 'one', 'bright', 'spot', 'whole', 'film', 'one', 'hope', 'are', 'truly', 'good', 'decent', 'people', 'out', 'there', 'universe', 'who', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'matter', 'what', 'cost', 'daughter-in-law', 'who', 'so', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Setsuko', 'Hara', 'truly', 'parents', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'blood', 'relatives', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'slowly', 'forgetting', 'dead', 'son', 'husband.Bottom', 'line', 'very', 'poignant', 'sadly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'heart', 'deeply', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'worth', 'watching', 'simple', 'yet', 'intense', 'portrayal']",N/A

493605,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000006D1S,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Tokyo Story is a timeless and deeply moving masterpiece; the theme of being kind to one's parents will always remain relevant to human nature. In the film we see relationships not just between elderly parents and their children but also the dynamics between grown, adult children and their spouses--and even their own small children who are also the grandchildren in the family. Yasujir Ozu's use of the camera at a tatami mat angle with characters often speaking their lines directly at the camera is brilliant and enhances the film greatly; this makes everything so much more artistic and gripping. As others have noted, there is indeed a ""calm"" feeling to the film as the plot develops with those images of nature to break up the story and more but make no mistake about it--there is so much depth to this story and many of the conversations are incredibly honest and revealing.Elderly parents Tomi and Sukichi Hirayama (Chieko Higashiyama as the mother Tomi and Chish Ry as the father Sukichi) travel a great distance by train to see their grown children and grandchildren in a Tokyo suburb. Their youngest daughter who still lives with them, Kyko (Kyko Kagawa), stays behind in their rural village. In Tokyo, their daughter Shige (Haruko Sugimura) is not exactly pleased that they are there; she berates her mother publicly for supposedly having broken a chair many, many years ago which is particularly disrespectful in light of how Japanese tradition dictates respect for one's elders. Their son Koichi (S Yamamura), a doctor, doesn't really want them there either--the elderly parents are seen as a burden and they are getting ""in the way."" Indeed, even Tomi and Sukichi's grandchildren are incredibly rude to them. The only person who is happy to see them is their widowed former daughter-in-law Noriko (Setsuko Hara); while she is not a blood relative Noriko treats her former in-laws extremely well.I don't want to give out many spoilers but I will say that the grown children essentially get rid of their parents by sending them to a noisy health spa in Atami. Tomi and Sukichi decide to go home after only a short stay at the spa and we see what happens when they want to visit their youngest son Keizo (Shir Osaka).Suffice it to say that when there is an unexpected tragedy the adult children finally do take off some time--just about one day (maybe two if you count the long train ride); it really got me thinking about how I treat my elderly father and whether or not I am truly giving him all of my love and respect while he is still living.Another interesting aspect of this film is that while the children are far from perfect, the father has his foibles, too. Shige has been embarrassed by her father's drunken binges when she was much younger; this is in stark contrast to ""Make Way for Tomorrow,"" the film that inspired this movie, in which both parents were more responsible.Tokyo Story remains one of the best films of all time. True, the story may take place in a very different time and place but the message of being kind to your elderly parents instead of casting them aside in nursing homes or even spa-like living facilities will always be relevant and timeless. I highly recommend this film for fans of director Yasujir Ozu and the actors in this film. People who appreciate five star foreign films that are cerebral and emotional will not be disappointed. And, if you *really* want to have a great edition of this film, consider getting the two DVD Criterion Collection release instead of this single DVD release; there are some fine extras on that second DVD!",5,Ozu's masterpiece,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,3592,"['Tokyo', 'Story', 'timeless', 'deeply', 'moving', 'masterpiece', 'theme', 'being', 'kind', 'one', 'parents', 'will', 'always', 'remain', 'relevant', 'human', 'nature', 'film', 'see', 'relationships', 'not', 'just', 'elderly', 'parents', 'children', 'also', 'dynamics', 'grown', 'adult', 'children', 'spouses', 'even', 'own', 'small', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'grandchildren', 'family', 'Yasujir', 'Ozu', 'use', 'camera', 'tatami', 'mat', 'angle', 'characters', 'often', 'speaking', 'lines', 'directly', 'camera', 'brilliant', 'film', 'greatly', 'everything', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'artistic', 'gripping', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'indeed', 'calm', 'feeling', 'film', 'plot', 'images', 'nature', 'break', 'up', 'story', 'more', 'make', 'mistake', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'story', 'many', 'conversations', 'are', 'incredibly', 'honest', 'revealing.Elderly', 'parents', 'Tomi', 'Sukichi', 'Hirayama', 'Chieko', 'Higashiyama', 'mother', 'Tomi', 'Chish', 'Ry', 'father', 'Sukichi', 'travel', 'great', 'distance', 'train', 'see', 'grown', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'Tokyo', 'suburb', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'who', 'still', 'Kyko', 'Kyko', 'Kagawa', 'rural', 'village', 'Tokyo', 'daughter', 'Shige', 'Haruko', 'Sugimura', 'not', 'exactly', 'pleased', 'are', 'there', 'mother', 'publicly', 'supposedly', 'having', 'broken', 'chair', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'particularly', 'disrespectful', 'light', 'how', 'Japanese', 'tradition', 'dictates', 'respect', 'one', 'elders', 'son', 'Koichi', 'S', 'Yamamura', 'doctor', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'there', 'elderly', 'parents', 'are', 'seen', 'burden', 'are', 'getting', 'way', 'Indeed', 'even', 'Tomi', 'Sukichi', 'grandchildren', 'are', 'incredibly', 'rude', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'happy', 'see', 'widowed', 'former', 'daughter-in-law', 'Noriko', 'Setsuko', 'Hara', 'not', 'blood', 'relative', 'Noriko', 'former', 'in-laws', 'extremely', 'well.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'out', 'many', 'spoilers', 'will', 'say', 'grown', 'children', 'essentially', 'get', 'rid', 'parents', 'sending', 'noisy', 'health', 'spa', 'Atami', 'Tomi', 'Sukichi', 'decide', 'go', 'home', 'only', 'short', 'stay', 'spa', 'see', 'what', 'when', 'want', 'visit', 'youngest', 'son', 'Keizo', 'Shir', 'Osaka', 'say', 'when', 'unexpected', 'tragedy', 'adult', 'children', 'finally', 'do', 'take', 'off', 'time', 'just', 'one', 'day', 'maybe', 'two', 'count', 'long', 'train', 'ride', 'really', 'got', 'thinking', 'how', 'treat', 'elderly', 'father', 'not', 'am', 'truly', 'giving', 'love', 'respect', 'still', 'living.Another', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'film', 'children', 'are', 'far', 'perfect', 'father', 'foibles', 'too', 'Shige', 'been', 'embarrassed', 'father', 'drunken', 'binges', 'when', 'was', 'much', 'younger', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Make', 'Way', 'Tomorrow', 'film', 'inspired', 'movie', 'parents', 'were', 'more', 'responsible.Tokyo', 'Story', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'time', 'True', 'story', 'may', 'take', 'place', 'very', 'different', 'time', 'place', 'message', 'being', 'kind', 'elderly', 'parents', 'instead', 'casting', 'aside', 'nursing', 'homes', 'even', 'spa-like', 'living', 'facilities', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'relevant', 'timeless', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'director', 'Yasujir', 'Ozu', 'actors', 'film', 'People', 'who', 'appreciate', 'five', 'star', 'foreign', 'films', 'are', 'cerebral', 'emotional', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', '*really*', 'want', 'have', 'great', 'edition', 'film', 'consider', 'getting', 'two', 'DVD', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'release', 'instead', 'single', 'DVD', 'release', 'are', 'fine', 'extras', 'second', 'DVD']",N/A

493607,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000006D1S,mirasreviews,"[2, 2]","""Tokyo Story"" is the best-known film in the West by Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu, whose depictions of everyday life in post-war Japan earned him a reputation as ""the poet of the quotidian"". Here he explores the inevitability of change, the generational conflicts that it engenders, and life's inherent disappointments through the experiences of an older couple who journey from their sleepy seaside town to bustling Tokyo to visit their two eldest children. Tomi (Chieko Higashiyama) and Shukishi Hirayama (Chishu Ryu) look forward to seeing their children, grandchildren, and the big city, but their son Koichi (So Yamamura), a health clinic doctor, is too busy to show them around. And their daughter Shige (Haruku Sugimara) resents being inconvenienced by their visit. Only Noriko (Setsuko Hara), their lonely widowed daughter-in-law, appreciates the couple's company.Made in 1953, ""Tokyo Story"" is fascinating in retrospect for its documentation of life in post-war Japan, characterized by rapid change and 6-day work weeks that created the prosperity that Japanese now enjoy. The film has many narrative ellipses, where it skips events or action, but it lingers on seemingly trivial facets of daily life. The camera is usually static, often at floor-mat level even after the characters stand. I found the lower-than-usual perspective and the tendency of characters to come and go from the frame a nice change from conventional camera placement. ""Tokyo Story"" has a measured, slow pace, which I associate with a certain style of Japanese film. It takes patience until I get used to it, but after a while I fell into this film's metronomic rhythm. The film's pace is a large part of its poetry.Setsuko Hara, a huge star in Japan at the time, is radiant and naturally sympathetic. The children-in-law are more conscious of treating their elders well than their own children are. But Shige seems a tad too vilified and Noriko too sanctified for modern sensibilities. Ultimately ""Tokyo Story"" embraces the inevitability of its characters' relationships, though, and isn't judgmental. Blaming the characters would undercut Ozu's premise that times and people change, and nothing lives up to expectations. This print (Criterion Collection 2003) has minor specks and scratches. An audio commentary by David Desser, who edited a book about this film, is rehearsed and informative. He discusses the film's themes and provides a scene-by-scene analysis of composition.

Foreign films complicate the problem because of cultural differences.  In this simple story of aging parents living in a distant province of Japan who decides it is time to visit their 2 grown children who live in Tokyo.  Their widowed daughter-in-law (wonderful performance by Setsuko Hara) lives there as well.  The trip is an arduous one, taking 2 days on the train.Initially they stay with their oldest son who is a medical doctor in a neighborhood clinic outside the lights of the city.  His wife is quite accommodating while their two bratty sons are just annoying.  Their oldest daughter has her own hair solon and is married with no children.  While the 10 day trip was planned and anticipated, the older children have a hard time finding the time to spend with their parents.  They decide to ship them off to a nearby seaside spa.  After a day or two, the couple has had enough and return to their children.The siblings are conflicted as to what to do with their parents.  The exception is Noriko (Hara) who lost her husband to the war and has never remarried, remaining faithful to her husband and his family.  The parents encourage her to forget the son and remarry.  Noriko is kind to both, takes time off from work and shows them the city.  On the return trip to their home, the mother falls ill and dies shortly thereafter.  The two children, Noriko and another son join the father at his home for the funeral but return quickly to their lives back in Tokyo.  Only Noriko remains for another day or two to spend time with her father-in-law.One of the things I noticed is that this post-WW II era was likely a transition for the Japanese and their culture.  Their provincial formality and deference to the elderly was being replaced by the hurried rebuilding of their country.  To me that seems understandable.  Famed director Yasuijiro Ozu is recognized for some interesting camera work and that is surely evident here.  Distantly framed shots of one or two people against the expansive ocean, low camera angles and long uncut scenes are numerous.At the same time, there is a scene on a tour bus shot from the front of the bus looking back.  All of the tourists turn their heads in unison when the guide calls their attention to some ancient building.  Then again in unison, they all turn their heads back to the front of the bus.  This choreographed movement seemed so unnatural.  There are also isolated scenes where the characters engaged in conversation, talk directly into the camera, one person at a time.  Again, it may be me, but it was disconcerting.This is a sad story of families growing apart over time and distance.  It resonates today in most cultures I suspect and often with much less kindness than is shown in this film.",3,3 1/2 stars for Japanese classic,1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,2843,"['One', 'problems', 'often', 'have', 'looking', 'back', 'classic', 'films', 'resettling', 'era', 'Foreign', 'films', 'complicate', 'problem', 'cultural', 'differences', 'simple', 'story', 'aging', 'parents', 'living', 'distant', 'province', 'Japan', 'who', 'time', 'visit', '2', 'grown', 'children', 'who', 'live', 'Tokyo', 'widowed', 'daughter-in-law', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Setsuko', 'Hara', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'trip', 'arduous', 'one', 'taking', '2', 'days', 'train.Initially', 'stay', 'oldest', 'son', 'who', 'medical', 'doctor', 'neighborhood', 'clinic', 'lights', 'city', 'wife', 'quite', 'accommodating', 'two', 'bratty', 'sons', 'are', 'just', 'annoying', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'own', 'hair', 'solon', 'married', 'children', '10', 'day', 'trip', 'was', 'planned', 'anticipated', 'older', 'children', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'finding', 'time', 'spend', 'parents', 'decide', 'ship', 'off', 'nearby', 'seaside', 'spa', 'day', 'two', 'couple', 'had', 'enough', 'return', 'children.The', 'siblings', 'are', 'conflicted', 'what', 'do', 'parents', 'exception', 'Noriko', 'Hara', 'who', 'lost', 'husband', 'war', 'never', 'remarried', 'remaining', 'faithful', 'husband', 'family', 'parents', 'encourage', 'forget', 'son', 'remarry', 'Noriko', 'kind', 'time', 'off', 'work', 'city', 'return', 'trip', 'home', 'mother', 'ill', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'two', 'children', 'Noriko', 'son', 'join', 'father', 'home', 'funeral', 'return', 'quickly', 'lives', 'back', 'Tokyo', 'Only', 'Noriko', 'day', 'two', 'spend', 'time', 'father-in-law.One', 'things', 'noticed', 'post-WW', 'II', 'era', 'was', 'likely', 'transition', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'provincial', 'formality', 'deference', 'elderly', 'was', 'being', 'replaced', 'hurried', 'rebuilding', 'country', 'understandable', 'Famed', 'director', 'Yasuijiro', 'Ozu', 'recognized', 'interesting', 'camera', 'work', 'surely', 'evident', 'here', 'Distantly', 'framed', 'shots', 'one', 'two', 'people', 'expansive', 'ocean', 'low', 'camera', 'angles', 'long', 'uncut', 'scenes', 'are', 'same', 'time', 'scene', 'tour', 'bus', 'shot', 'front', 'bus', 'looking', 'back', 'tourists', 'turn', 'heads', 'unison', 'when', 'guide', 'attention', 'ancient', 'building', 'Then', 'again', 'unison', 'turn', 'heads', 'back', 'front', 'bus', 'choreographed', 'movement', 'seemed', 'so', 'unnatural', 'are', 'also', 'isolated', 'scenes', 'where', 'characters', 'engaged', 'conversation', 'talk', 'directly', 'camera', 'one', 'person', 'time', 'Again', 'may', 'be', 'was', 'disconcerting.This', 'sad', 'story', 'families', 'growing', 'apart', 'time', 'distance', 'today', 'most', 'cultures', 'suspect', 'often', 'much', 'less', 'kindness', 'shown', 'film']",N/A

But finally the wait for me is over, and I've had the pleasure of watching A Tokyo Story. What can I say about it that hasn't already been said a thousand times over by other reviewers?The plot is well known enough: an elderly couple plan a trip to Tokyo only to find themselves more of a burden than a pleasure to be with their selfish children. Their son, a neighborhood doctor, has patients to care for, and their daughter, a beautician, would rather work than entertain her family.It's a simple enough plot that if made today would have probably escalated into a dramatic scene of a family pitted against each other, telling the wrongs of one another. But nothing of the sort happens. Instead what we get is a resignation to indifferences, and the acceptance of the idea that ""it could be worse..."".Plot aside, there are some beautiful scenes in this movie. One of the elderly couple sitting together, facing the sea, two people all alone in a large world. All of the shots of the caring daughter in law are breathtaking. She's a beautiful woman on the inside, and I think Ozu highlighted this fact with every scene that she was in. She smiles for her in laws, but when they turn away she's on the verge of tears, overwhelmed by her own misguided guilt.Tokyo Story is a slow moving film, but many things develop in that time.

But if you have experienced death of a parent, or the awkwardness of dealing with grown siblings, or even dealing with embarrassing parental behavior---there is something here for you. In addition, if you are at all a History Channel buff, there is the added attraction of seeing life in postwar Japan, and what the middle-class there were doing while we were having our baby boom and moving to our ""little boxes"" in the suburbs. I like to look at the clothes and also see a society in a major transition while still having the influence (still felt) from American occupation. Plus if you are interested in religious and social practices, the funeral in the film is moving, and you may even come away with the Buddhist funeral chantings droning on in your head (I mean that in a GOOD way). It's kinda fun to compare this with American films about Japan made in the same period, like ""Sayonara"" and ""Teahouse of the August Moon"". And if you like this, you should see ""Odd Obsession"" and some of Kurosawa's contemporary films, like ""High and Low"".I don't know about what you learn about in 4th grade in 2003, but when I was in 4th grade we had to learn about Japan.

I ended up blind-buying the Criterion Tokyo Story from my work because it had just been sold back used and with my employee discount it came to $15 (Le Cercle Rouge was also sold back, also $15). I didn't know if I'd like it but if I didn't I knew a LOT of people who would be willing to pay me the fifteen dollars I spent to get their hands on it, so it was all good.However, that will be unnecessary. I ended up loving just about every minute of it. I don't know quite what was different about Ozu's style this time around as opposed to Story of Floating Weeds, but I think it has something to do with it being sound-era and not having all those intertitles disrupting everything. Story of Floating Weeds was rather dialog-heavy for a silent era film, and it seems that Ozu's particular style is pretty much dialog heavy anyway, so he just works better in the sound era. That said, half the time I forgot the dialog seconds after reading it but never felt like I needed it. Even though this movie is basically people sitting around talking for two hours and fifteen minutes (with a death put in for good effect), it was a very pleasant visual experience.The whole low-angle static camera approach worked better than I ever thought possible, being a Western film student and all. I was sitting on the floor eating while I was watching it, and the angle with the television was spot on with the angles in the film, so I felt like I was either sitting around watching all of this unfold or was a little kid again watching it unfold. The best part was that I've already read all that stuff about Ozu and family, and he gets it spot on. I felt like I was at another one of my family's reunions, where everyone's happy to see each other and all but different levels of business and energy just eventually tire everyone out.Also, Ozu's quiet, methodical approach to building a quiet, almost listless world is very peaceful and alluring. With only two shots in the entire film with a moving camera, everything felt wonderfully zen (though I wouldn't label Ozu a Buddhist. His importance of family motif is a bit too worldly for Buddhists). A definite ""beingness"" pronounced the film and helped it be more than just a slide show of a family reunion.5 stars.--PolarisDiB",5,Very peaceful and alluring,1145318400,"04 18, 2006",2006,2395,"['Tokyo', 'StoryThe', 'only', 'other', 'Ozu', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'Story', 'Floating', 'Weeds', 'silent', 'era', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'very', 'much', 'ended', 'up', 'blind-buying', 'Criterion', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'work', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'sold', 'back', 'used', 'employee', 'discount', 'came', '15', 'Le', 'Cercle', 'Rouge', 'was', 'also', 'sold', 'back', 'also', '15', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'like', 'did', ""n't"", 'knew', 'LOT', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'pay', 'fifteen', 'dollars', 'spent', 'get', 'hands', 'was', 'good.However', 'will', 'be', 'unnecessary', 'ended', 'up', 'loving', 'just', 'minute', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'quite', 'what', 'was', 'different', 'Ozu', 'style', 'time', 'around', 'as', 'opposed', 'Story', 'Floating', 'Weeds', 'think', 'something', 'do', 'being', 'sound-era', 'not', 'having', 'intertitles', 'disrupting', 'everything', 'Story', 'Floating', 'Weeds', 'was', 'rather', 'dialog-heavy', 'silent', 'era', 'film', 'Ozu', 'particular', 'style', 'pretty', 'much', 'dialog', 'heavy', 'anyway', 'just', 'better', 'sound', 'era', 'said', 'time', 'forgot', 'dialog', 'reading', 'never', 'felt', 'needed', 'Even', 'movie', 'basically', 'people', 'sitting', 'talking', 'two', 'hours', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'death', 'put', 'good', 'effect', 'was', 'very', 'pleasant', 'visual', 'experience.The', 'whole', 'low-angle', 'static', 'camera', 'approach', 'worked', 'better', 'ever', 'thought', 'possible', 'being', 'Western', 'film', 'student', 'was', 'sitting', 'floor', 'eating', 'was', 'watching', 'angle', 'television', 'was', 'spot', 'angles', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'either', 'sitting', 'watching', 'unfold', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'again', 'watching', 'unfold', 'best', 'part', 'was', ""'ve"", 'already', 'read', 'stuff', 'Ozu', 'family', 'spot', 'felt', 'was', 'one', 'family', 'reunions', 'where', 'everyone', 'happy', 'see', 'other', 'different', 'levels', 'business', 'energy', 'just', 'eventually', 'tire', 'everyone', 'out.Also', 'Ozu', 'quiet', 'methodical', 'approach', 'building', 'quiet', 'almost', 'listless', 'world', 'very', 'peaceful', 'alluring', 'only', 'two', 'shots', 'entire', 'film', 'moving', 'camera', 'everything', 'felt', 'wonderfully', 'zen', 'would', ""n't"", 'label', 'Ozu', 'Buddhist', 'importance', 'family', 'motif', 'bit', 'too', 'worldly', 'Buddhists', 'definite', 'beingness', 'pronounced', 'film', 'helped', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'slide', 'show', 'family', 'reunion.5', 'stars.', 'PolarisDiB']",N/A

It is like spending a good two hours  with a next door neighbour. This, the most revered of his films, takes a  simple story of an elderly couple visiting their neglectful grown-up  children, which could have been a melodrama; instead he elevates it to a  philosophical medidation on the transience of human existence and  privileges of living.

It is is excellent because it tells a meaningful story in a very simplistic manner.  A retired Japanese couple decide to go to the Big City to visit their adult children.  This is a big event, something they apparently have not done for a long time, if ever.  Their experiences, once they get to their destination, are disappointing.  Their children seem to mean well but it is obvious that mom and dad are &quot;in the way&quot;.  This seems to be more obvious to the viewers than to mom and dad who seem content with the little attention that they get.  There is a tragic ending to the story but the real tragedy has already manifested itself before then.The movie touches us because it hits so close to home (literally).  This COULD be us in any of the roles we see.  Are we the son who is too busy to take the time to be with his parents?  Are we the daughter who wishes they would just visit and leave without staying so long?  Are we the son who worries more about how the parents visit will disrupt his life than how he can make their visit enjoyable?  Are we the daughter-in-law who can't do enough to entertain them (don't we wish we are)?  Or are we the parents who raised these children who are too blind (or is it polite) to realize what we have created (the song &quot;Cat's in the Cradle&quot; comes to mind).The acting in this movie is exceptional because it makes us feel that we really are looking into the lives of an actual family.  Nothing is over-stated nor under-stated, it just seems to happen.  I wondered how I would have appreciated this movie if I hadn't known of its excellent rating (one of &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;'s  top ten of all-time greatest movies).  To be honest, I doubt I would have even had the opportunity to see it.  However, I think that it would have touched me just as sincerely as it did.

But he hit his stride with &quot;Tokyo Story.&quot; Ozu movies are about the lower or middle classes, their interior lives in a very crowded and small country. This film has been ranked by various film organizations as one of the best ten movies ever made. It is a snapshot of the aspiring middle class of Japan in 1953. The war is fading and the post-war miracle is in the making. The young Japanese are striving and materialistic, but it should be said, they live in a very small world indeed. Their houses, even the house of the doctor-son is tiny and everyone sits on the floor, there are no chairs. The elderly parents representing the old Japan visit their two sons and daughter in a rebuilding, industrialized Tokyo. The parents are not welcomed warmly, but are shuttled off to a resort. Only the daughter-in-law welcomes them. Her husband had been killed in the war and she honors his memory by honoring her in-laws. Then the mother dies and the kids go to the funeral and then get back to work. All the scenes of family life take place in tiny interiors where there are for example, close up shots of two kimonoed women talking intimately with much politeness. The exterior shots contrast an industrial world of smokestacks with the beauty of the Japanese mountains and seacoast. The camera angles are very precise. The actors are unbelievably good. If you are looking for plot, you won't find much here, but you will find a studied slice of life. This movie is long and in black and white.

493618,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000006D1S,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","Tokyo Story (Yasujiro Ozu, 1953)It says something-- though I'm not sure what-- about my culture that IMDB's ""if you liked this you'll like..."" recommendations for Tokyo Monogatari include The Grudge and Spider-Man 2. Whatever it says, I'm pretty sure it's not good. For Tokyo Monogatari is an entirely different film, not in the same genre-- not even in the same ballpark, or for that matter the same zip code-- as those movies. Perhaps not even the same planet. Action? Terror? Attractive if vapid soul-searching protagonist? Escapism? Hardly.Tokyo Monogatari is the story of an elderly rural couple (Chishu Ryu and Cheiko Higashiyama) who go to visit their children in Tokyo. Their children have no time for them and, with the awkwardness into which everyone is spun by the parents' arrival, ship them off to the hot springs. While they are there, the wife takes ill, and the couple return home; in a reversal of the original premise, the second act has the children rushing to the couple's rural home, berating themselves and each other over their not making time for their parents.This is an exceptionally slow film, and that is not helped by the fact that there are parts of it that are quite uncomfortable to watch-- not because they tread on delicate subject matter or anything like that, but because Ozu and Noda's script recreates the kind of quotidian dialogue one hears in real life in vivid detail. Note that I'm not talking about the sort of brilliant rapidfire banter that one gets from, say, a Tarantino script, but the endless, annoying small talk that people make just to pass the time. There are a lot of people who don't like this movie-- who detest it, really-- because of this. And, yes, it makes the first half-hour of the film hard to suffer through. But that's the point of it. Ozu is introducing us to shallow characters, and the characters who actually have some sort of life are reduced to talking to them on their level. Once you get to the climax of the film, it all makes sense, as the true shallowness of some of these characters is revealed. In the interim, however, we are treated to characters that are drawn in exquisite detail, with Ryu's especially becoming deeper and deeper as we see more facets of the person he is (and how those facets grate, of course, on the shallow people around him).Film historians debate-- idly, of course-- whether Kurosawa or Ozu was the definitive postwar Japanese director. It's an impossible debate, given that both of them stand head and shoulders above everything else Japan was doing at the time (and, for that matter, most of what the rest of the world was doing). I tend to see them more as complementary; Kurosawa's big, bold action films stand beside Ozu's quiet, contemplative pieces to provide a coherent, and brilliant, whole.

Apparently, the stationary floor-level camera, doorway and hallway framings, underplayed acting of the old couple, snail's-pace plot movement, violation of the 180 degree sightline have all contributed to the cult-like following the film has attracted.It's enjoyable, moving, and cinematically satisfying: compared to the constant stream of action, shock editing, and shrill noise of most present-day American movies, ""Tokyo Story"" is like a necklace composed of visual haikus, each shot worthy of being savored by the discerning reviewer.  But the stillness, however poignant, doesn't hold enough ""music"" for me--that lyrical and rhapsodic dimension of film that plays not only in the soundtrack but is made visible by the lyrical movement of the camera as well.  The most memorable films are also the most ""melodramatic""--a balance of sight and sound, the visual and the aural, the spatial and the temporal.  The greatest films not only expose loss but restore it through the fullness of music.Among Japanese films, the one that comes closest to the melodramatic, or drama+music, standard is Kinoshita's ""24-Eyes,"" a 1954 film that's as ""operatic"" as it is cinematic, permitting a richness of expression in time that compensates for the elegiac sadness that accumulates with the passage of the years from pre-war to post WWII Japan.  But there's also a 1930s American film which, since first seeing it 1979, I've been unable to locate.  Entitled ""Make Way for Tomorrow,"" it's a movie with a storyline identical to that of ""Tokyo Story.""

It is the sort of film that, after seeing it, may easily change you. I originally purchased the film because I was incredibly interested in the &quot;Ozu style&quot;. There are many aspects of this little Japanese man's style, including shots of nature to break up the story, the tatami mat camera angle, the unmoving camera, and the shooting of characters speaking directly into the camera (which makes it all the more profound, it puts the viewer into the story). Ozu scarcely EVER drifted from this style, therefore it MUST have been quite incredible, for he never had the desire to change it. However, although I was compelled by the extremely elegant filmmaking style, it was the emotional impact that sticks with me the most. The story felt very slow as it unwound, with much of the dialogue feeling very small talk-ish. However, despite the fact I was initially disappointed by this small talk-like dialogue, by the end, I realized this slowness of developement made the end all the more powerful. This ending was so powerful that I was completely in tears for the final half hour or so of the film. This film was SO profound that I felt moved upon viewing it. Near the end of the picture, when one of the daughters stated &quot;Life is too short.&quot; I was moved. I felt compelled to go out and live it up, for life IS too short. I also realized that I need to be much kinder to my parents, for they give me so much, and they will not be around forever.

In this case, it is how we treat our parents once we no longer need them for survival.  Are they a bother?  Do we resent their old-fashioned ways and slower pace?  Are we perhaps a bit too eager to shuffle them to the sidelines?The story seems so simple, an elderly couple leaves the country to visit their children who have moved away to Tokyo.  Country folk meet city folk, age meets youth, life meets death.  There are no big blow-ups, no crisis points reached or contrived dramas, just life flowing along as it does.  In Ozu's gentle hands, the entire story is told between the lines, with perhaps not a single sentence of direct dialog spoken in the film.  Under the calm surface is an ocean of depth, emotions flowing with an unstoppable power, yet never able to breach the veneer of etiquette and politeness.Ozu's usual cast in at their best.  Chishu Ryu plays the father perfectly, flawed and kind, strict in his youth yet lenient in his old age, he is a father-figure more than a father to his impatient children.  Chieko Higashiyama plays the kind and appreciative mother, much the same character as in &quot;Early Summer.&quot;  As always, Setsuko Hara, Japan's &quot;Eternal Virgin,&quot; brings light and love into an otherwise dismal story playing Noriko, the widowed Daughter-in-law of Ryu and Higashiyama's son.  Setsuko is ironically the only one of their children to appreciate the aged parents, even though she is not a blood-child.&quot;Tokyo Story&quot; forced me to examine my own treatment of my parents, and consider how I will be treated when it is my time to visit my children.  Will they dread my coming?  Am I kind to my parents?  That is the kind of power this film has.Of course, the Criterion Collection presentation is wonderful, with one of the best transfers of &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; I have seen.
