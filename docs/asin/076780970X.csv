His stuff is usually thin on plot, full of laughable dialogue, and  fist-thick on martial arts.  Does that mean that I don't watch his stuff?  No it doesn't.  I've watched his movies because there are times that I  don't want to think, just escape, and he provides just that in ""Maximum  Risk"".  Out of his movies that I have seen, this one turned out to be one  of his best, if not the best (but honestly, he doesn't give us a lot to  choose from).""Maximum Risk"" is an extremely violent movie with a very  high body count.  I lost track of the dead early on.  While the plot is as  thin as always (Russian mafia, twin brother, beautiful girl), Ringo Lam  pumps it up with some nifty car chases (if you like that sort of thing) and  provides the viewer with one heck of a ride as we step over the bodies.  This is non-stop action from the get-go, and the fight scenes (yes, there  are many) are hard-hitting and brutal, yet believable (almost a  first).For those that like Van Damme, this movie should be high on your  list.  For the rest of us, well, it is violent and even mean-spirited, but  I ended up enjoying the ride, and the credit must go to director Lam.

10060,A2IY9M330NKBW6,076780970X,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","Legendary Hong Kong action director Ringo Lam tries his shot with Van Damme and does an outstanding job.Van Damme, as a French cop, finds he has a twin brother he never knew about. Problem is, he finds out after his twin is already dead. He needs to dig deeper into his bro's cause of death and when he does he finds his brother was in deep with both the Russian mob and the FBI. He has dirt on both of them, hence his untimely death. Now he needs to get himself, along with his late brother's girlfriend (played by Natasha Henstridge), out of the deep doo-doo his brother was in.This movie starts out at full throttle and rarely lets up. In true Ringo Lam style you are treated to some of the best directed and choreographed fight scenes, chase scenes and shoot-em-up scenes ever. One way cool fight scene near the beginning of the film takes place inside a burning room. I'm still trying to figure out how they pulled that off.Unfortunately there were also some bad decisions made. For instance: One of the FBI agents is such a grossly overweight buffoon you know there was no way he ever was or ever would be in the FBI. One of the stunts in the climax is so laughable it's difficult to imagine Lam let it pass. Now, I like seeing Henstrige naked as much as the next guy, but the love scene between her and Van Damme needed to be inserted with a crow bar. It was just poorly timed and totally gratuitous.These quibbles aside, this is still on heck of a ride. For those into the action genre of films this is right up there near the top. Order some pizza.

Does he have sex with a C-List actress?  JCVD has never attained a higher level than Natasha Henstridge, who looks absolutely stunning5.  Is there a tournament? There is no tournament.  But since there are two JCVDs, that wouldn't have been fair anyway, now would it?6.  Is training needed for this tournament?  No training needed7.  Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament? No splits are done8.  Does he punch someone in the balls?  An early knee to the sack is delivered just for the checkmark9.  Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks?  Most definitely10.  Is his enemy unbeatable? The Russian mob and the FBI are formidable, but far from unbeatable.11.

It's like pouring a gallon of win into a shot glass.Opening with the greatest ""mobile fruit stand being pursued by the Russian mafia""-chase scene in cinema history, JCVD teams up with director Ringo Lam for his first completely jaw-dropping JCVD experience - they later paired up for Replicant (another JCVDx2 venture) and Wake of Death (JCVD's best acting job). From the very beginning, there is no doubt that awesome-factor 10 is about to ensue.The plot is typical of Van Damme movies and soap operas: A relative of JCVD gets killed (i.e. JCVD #1), it turns out to be his twin brother, and it's up to JCVD to spin-kick and ball-punch his way through the Russian mafia for the answers.  Without going to deep into it, this is tied for first place for all JCVD movies.  A few reasons why:- Natasha Henstridge completely nude, multiple times- Claustrophobic car chase on narrow European streets- The only JCVD movie to feature strippers- Three of the best fight scenes in cinema history against a Russian behemoth (who looks like NFL-bust Brian Bosworth):a) best fist fight inside a fiery inferno in cinema historyb) best elevator knife fight in cinema historyc) best non-gay bathhouse fight by two guys in nothing but towels in cinema historyTo top it all off, I'm completely convinced the game Crazy Taxi (released in 1999) and Mel Gibson's character from Conspiracy Theory (1997) - conveniently one year after Maximum Risk - were completely plagiarized from an insane New York cab driver from this movie.",5,"If you don't like this, you don't like action movies",1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,2688,"['Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Review', 'Matrix', 'JCVD-RM', '1.', 'Who', 'first', 'Russian', 'guy', 'named', 'Mikhail', 'Suverov', 'then', 'French', 'Policeman', 'named', 'Alain', 'Moreau2', 'Which', 'family', 'member/friend', 'must', 'be', 'avenged', 'When', 'Suverov', 'capped', 'Russian', 'mob', 'JCVDx23', 'take', 'shirt', 'off', 'most', 'homoerotic', 'places', 'Russian', 'bath-house', 'up', 'later', '4', 'Does', 'have', 'sex', 'C-List', 'actress', 'JCVD', 'never', 'attained', 'higher', 'level', 'Natasha', 'Henstridge', 'who', 'absolutely', 'stunning5', 'there', 'tournament', 'tournament', 'are', 'two', 'JCVDs', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'fair', 'anyway', 'now', 'would', '6', 'training', 'needed', 'tournament', 'No', 'training', 'needed7', 'do', 'splits', 'training', 'tournament', 'splits', 'are', 'done8', 'punch', 'someone', 'balls', 'early', 'knee', 'sack', 'delivered', 'just', 'checkmark9', 'do', 'series', 'flying', '360', 'kicks', 'Most', 'definitely10', 'enemy', 'unbeatable', 'Russian', 'mob', 'FBI', 'are', 'formidable', 'far', 'unbeatable.11', 'overcome', 'injury', 'other', 'hindrance', 'stabbed', 'early', 'tis', 'flesh', 'wound.12', 'win', 'pouring', 'gallon', 'win', 'shot', 'glass.Opening', 'greatest', 'mobile', 'fruit', 'stand', 'being', 'pursued', 'Russian', 'mafia', '-chase', 'scene', 'cinema', 'history', 'JCVD', 'up', 'director', 'Ringo', 'Lam', 'first', 'completely', 'jaw-dropping', 'JCVD', 'experience', 'later', 'paired', 'up', 'Replicant', 'JCVDx2', 'venture', 'Wake', 'Death', 'JCVD', 'best', 'acting', 'job', 'very', 'beginning', 'doubt', 'awesome-factor', '10', 'ensue.The', 'plot', 'typical', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movies', 'soap', 'operas', 'relative', 'JCVD', 'killed', 'i.e', 'JCVD', '1', 'out', 'be', 'twin', 'brother', 'up', 'JCVD', 'spin-kick', 'ball-punch', 'way', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'answers', 'going', 'deep', 'tied', 'first', 'place', 'JCVD', 'movies', 'few', 'reasons', 'why', 'Natasha', 'Henstridge', 'completely', 'nude', 'multiple', 'times-', 'Claustrophobic', 'car', 'chase', 'narrow', 'European', 'streets-', 'only', 'JCVD', 'movie', 'feature', 'strippers-', 'Three', 'best', 'fight', 'scenes', 'cinema', 'history', 'Russian', 'behemoth', 'who', 'NFL-bust', 'Brian', 'Bosworth', 'best', 'fist', 'fight', 'fiery', 'inferno', 'cinema', 'historyb', 'best', 'elevator', 'knife', 'fight', 'cinema', 'historyc', 'best', 'non-gay', 'bathhouse', 'fight', 'two', 'guys', 'nothing', 'towels', 'cinema', 'historyTo', 'top', ""'m"", 'completely', 'convinced', 'game', 'Crazy', 'Taxi', 'released', '1999', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'character', 'Conspiracy', 'Theory', '1997', 'conveniently', 'one', 'year', 'Maximum', 'Risk', 'were', 'completely', 'plagiarized', 'insane', 'New', 'York', 'cab', 'driver', 'movie']",N/A

""Maximum Risk"" is Van Damme at his maximum best.  This high budget, lavishly produced, emotionally packed action film has a great plot with numerous chase scenes and daredevil stunts unfolding against a background of exotic locales.  All are highlighted by a suspenseful score form Robert Folk.Van Damme is police officer Alain Moreau who is investigating the death of his estranged twin brother, Mikhail Suverov, in the South of France.  His investigation leads him to New York City and his brother's girlfriend, Alex Minetti (model/actress Natasha Henstridge who was the alien femme fatale in ""Species"").  She works at a club operated by Russian mobsters.  Mistaking Alain for his twin, the mobsters soon try to kill him.  Corrupt FBI agents are using him to find a safe deposit box that can expose their illegal operations.  Meanwhile, Moreau is falling in love with Alex.  Held captive by Russian mobsters inside a hotel room, fearing for their lives, they make passionate love against the bathroom sink.Also hot on Moreau's trail is Red Face (Stefanos Miltsakakis), a blonde, muscular grim-faced hit man, who is an unstoppable fighting machine.  They engage in sweaty hand-to-hand combat inside a burning Parisian office building; they grapple with a knife in the cramp confines of a bank's elevator; and they kick box in a steamy Russian bath house.

The movie starts off with a pretty good car chase, followed by lots of scenes with guns firing and martial arts sequences. The plot isn't extensive -- Van Damme's character's twin brother is killed and he now assumes his twin's identity, only to be hounded by the Russian mafia and corrupt FBI agents.I've only seen the VHS version, so unfortunately I can't comment on the DVD sound and video quality.

10073,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,076780970X,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[3, 3]","During his glory days, Jean-Claude Van Damme was somewhat of a vehicle for Hong Kong directors wanting to break into the American film market: previously, he had saddled the freshman outings ofCorey Yuen,John Woo, and laterTsui Hark. While those directors were mostly interested in what they could get out of the Muscles from Brussels in terms of guns, car chases, and karate, Ringo Lam ofCity on Fireand ""Maximum Risk"" here seemed more intent on developing Van Damme beyond his action hero image via a step into the thriller genre. Whether he was successful is a matter of opinion, but it's unquestionable that this film is one of the most mature outings from this stage in our hero's career and definitely one of his most entertaining and interesting.The story: when French policeman Alain Moreau (Van Damme) uncovers the death of a twin brother he never knew existed, he assumes his identity to uncover the reason behind his death and his underworld connections in America.The script by Larry Ferguson (writer ofThe Hunt for Red Octoberand definitely one of the more respected people to pen a Van Damme movie) places storytelling over action setups and, in general, feels a bit smarter than the average Van Damme vehicle. There isn't any real mystery to the story, though: the revelation of Alain's brother and his affiliation with the Russian mafia is dealt with without too much buildup, and the story begins to revolve around Alain retreading his brother's unsuccessful steps to distance himself from the mob and escape from corrupt FBI agents. His relationship with his brother's old flame (Natasha Henstridge,Species) is interesting at first but is then more or less dropped into your lap. Nevertheless, the movie never loses a sense of suspense: Alain doesn't seem quite as empowered as other characters Van Damme was playing at the time, so it rarely seems impossible that he could be killed. Soundly-weighed production values by director Lam help set a good mood and the art direction is, at times, inspired.While the film's not built on it, the action content soundly supplements the package. Shootouts, car demolitions, and some on-foot chases are all fun enough, but it's the hand-to-hand fights that really catch your eye. This was arguably the first film in which Van Damme moved away from flashy karate moves and indulged in a slightly more realistic style of fight scene - inclusive of plenty of gritty brawling and grappling - and he couldn't have had a better opponent than vale tudo champion Stefanos Miltsakakis. Though their rematch inDerailedwas a disaster, their three encounters here are among the few instances in movies wherein MMA-esque fighting isn't a bore to watch. The battle in an elevator is especially entertaining and features brutal close-quarters choreography that wouldn't be matched until theBournemovies.The film features a pretty good cast, including Jean-Hugues Anglade (Betty Blue) as Alain's partner and David Hemblen (Exotica) in a limited role as the leader of the Russian mafia, but the unexpected dramatic moment of the picture belongs to Van Damme for a surprisingly adept instance of silent acting near the end of the movie wherein Alain listens to a recorded message by his late brother. Ringo Lam would continue to bring a little something extra out of Jean-Claude in the future, even directing him to his first-ever dramatic award nomination five years later, but ""Maximum Risk"" is probably the most palatable of all their collaborations for its all-around strengths and mainstream appeal. Van Damme fans can't go wrong, here.",4,"""I could find a penguin in a sand storm""",1303516800,"04 23, 2011",2011,3581,"['glory', 'days', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'was', 'somewhat', 'vehicle', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'directors', 'wanting', 'break', 'American', 'film', 'market', 'previously', 'had', 'saddled', 'freshman', 'outings', 'ofCorey', 'Yuen', 'John', 'Woo', 'laterTsui', 'Hark', 'directors', 'were', 'mostly', 'interested', 'what', 'could', 'get', 'Muscles', 'Brussels', 'terms', 'guns', 'car', 'chases', 'karate', 'Ringo', 'Lam', 'ofCity', 'Fireand', 'Maximum', 'Risk', 'here', 'seemed', 'more', 'intent', 'developing', 'Van', 'Damme', 'action', 'hero', 'image', 'step', 'thriller', 'genre', 'was', 'successful', 'matter', 'opinion', 'unquestionable', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'mature', 'outings', 'stage', 'hero', 'career', 'definitely', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'interesting.The', 'story', 'when', 'French', 'policeman', 'Alain', 'Moreau', 'Van', 'Damme', 'death', 'twin', 'brother', 'never', 'knew', 'existed', 'identity', 'uncover', 'reason', 'death', 'underworld', 'connections', 'America.The', 'script', 'Larry', 'Ferguson', 'writer', 'ofThe', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'Octoberand', 'definitely', 'one', 'more', 'respected', 'people', 'pen', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movie', 'places', 'storytelling', 'action', 'setups', 'general', 'bit', 'smarter', 'average', 'Van', 'Damme', 'vehicle', ""n't"", 'real', 'mystery', 'story', 'revelation', 'Alain', 'brother', 'affiliation', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'dealt', 'too', 'much', 'buildup', 'story', 'revolve', 'around', 'Alain', 'retreading', 'brother', 'unsuccessful', 'steps', 'distance', 'mob', 'escape', 'corrupt', 'FBI', 'agents', 'relationship', 'brother', 'old', 'flame', 'Natasha', 'Henstridge', 'Species', 'interesting', 'first', 'then', 'more', 'less', 'dropped', 'lap', 'Nevertheless', 'movie', 'never', 'sense', 'suspense', 'Alain', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'as', 'empowered', 'other', 'characters', 'Van', 'Damme', 'was', 'playing', 'time', 'rarely', 'impossible', 'could', 'be', 'killed', 'Soundly-weighed', 'production', 'values', 'director', 'Lam', 'help', 'set', 'good', 'mood', 'art', 'direction', 'times', 'film', 'not', 'built', 'action', 'content', 'soundly', 'package', 'Shootouts', 'car', 'demolitions', 'on-foot', 'chases', 'are', 'fun', 'enough', 'hand-to-hand', 'fights', 'really', 'catch', 'eye', 'was', 'arguably', 'first', 'film', 'Van', 'Damme', 'moved', 'away', 'flashy', 'karate', 'moves', 'indulged', 'slightly', 'more', 'realistic', 'style', 'fight', 'scene', 'inclusive', 'plenty', 'gritty', 'brawling', 'grappling', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'better', 'opponent', 'vale', 'tudo', 'champion', 'Stefanos', 'Miltsakakis', 'rematch', 'disaster', 'three', 'encounters', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'instances', 'movies', 'wherein', 'MMA-esque', 'fighting', ""n't"", 'bore', 'watch', 'battle', 'elevator', 'especially', 'entertaining', 'features', 'brutal', 'close-quarters', 'choreography', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'matched', 'theBournemovies.The', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'cast', 'including', 'Jean-Hugues', 'Anglade', 'Betty', 'Blue', 'Alain', 'partner', 'David', 'Hemblen', 'Exotica', 'limited', 'role', 'leader', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'unexpected', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'picture', 'Van', 'Damme', 'surprisingly', 'adept', 'instance', 'silent', 'acting', 'end', 'movie', 'wherein', 'Alain', 'recorded', 'message', 'late', 'brother', 'Ringo', 'Lam', 'would', 'continue', 'bring', 'little', 'something', 'Jean-Claude', 'future', 'even', 'directing', 'first-ever', 'dramatic', 'award', 'nomination', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'Maximum', 'Risk', 'probably', 'most', 'palatable', 'collaborations', 'all-around', 'strengths', 'mainstream', 'appeal', 'Van', 'Damme', 'fans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'here']",N/A

10078,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,076780970X,trebe,"[1, 1]","Hong Kong action film director Ringo Lam, makes his American film debut in Maximum Risk (1996), a gritty crime drama, that mostly stays in touch with reality.  Action star Jean-Claude van Damme, has a dual role playing twin brothers, Alain Moreau and Mikhail Suverov, separated as children.  Mikhail, a former member of the Russian underworld, is killed while trying to escape his criminal past in the south of France.  Alain, a member of the French police, was unaware that he had a twin brother, and after his investigations reveal cover-ups, arson, and a connection to New York, he borrows his brother's passport, and heads over the Atlantic, to the Big Apple.Mistaken for his brother, Alain hooks up with Mikhail's girlfriend Alex (Natasha Henstridge), and has the local Russian mafia stirred up, gunning for him.  The FBI is also in the picture, as what everyone seems to be after, is a secret list in a safe deposit box, in a bank in Nice, France.  Alain looks to make peace with the Russian mafia boss, but subordinate Ivan Dzasokhov (Zach Grenier) stages his assassination and a major purge, that almost costs Alain his life.  The fight scene in a sauna, is probably the most unrealistic action sequence in the film, but it is still rather entertaining.  Alain escapes, but is taken into FBI custody, and forced to take part in a plot to retrieve the secret list from the bank.The tone of Maximum Risk rarely wavers from being deadly serious.  Jean-Claude plays it straight, and does not get too cute.  The situations mostly stay within the limits of believability, resulting in a very tight, and credible film.  The action sequences don't really go over the top, yet there is enough edginess to keep things from being too pedestrian, even by 2010 standards.  Nicely paced, and bolstered by solid performances by van Damme and Henstridge, the film comes full circle, finishing with a violent flourish, in the south of France.  Things must have clicked between Lam, and van Damme, as they would also team up in Replicant (2001), and In Hell (2003).",4,Ringo Lam's rock solid Western debut . . .,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,2055,"['Hong', 'Kong', 'action', 'film', 'director', 'Ringo', 'Lam', 'American', 'film', 'debut', 'Maximum', 'Risk', '1996', 'gritty', 'crime', 'drama', 'mostly', 'touch', 'reality', 'Action', 'star', 'Jean-Claude', 'van', 'Damme', 'dual', 'role', 'playing', 'twin', 'brothers', 'Alain', 'Moreau', 'Mikhail', 'Suverov', 'separated', 'children', 'Mikhail', 'former', 'member', 'Russian', 'underworld', 'killed', 'trying', 'escape', 'criminal', 'past', 'south', 'France', 'Alain', 'member', 'French', 'police', 'was', 'unaware', 'had', 'twin', 'brother', 'investigations', 'reveal', 'cover-ups', 'arson', 'connection', 'New', 'York', 'brother', 'passport', 'heads', 'Atlantic', 'Big', 'Apple.Mistaken', 'brother', 'Alain', 'up', 'Mikhail', 'girlfriend', 'Alex', 'Natasha', 'Henstridge', 'local', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'stirred', 'up', 'gunning', 'FBI', 'also', 'picture', 'what', 'everyone', 'be', 'secret', 'list', 'safe', 'deposit', 'box', 'bank', 'Nice', 'France', 'Alain', 'make', 'peace', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'boss', 'subordinate', 'Ivan', 'Dzasokhov', 'Zach', 'Grenier', 'assassination', 'major', 'purge', 'almost', 'costs', 'Alain', 'life', 'fight', 'scene', 'sauna', 'probably', 'most', 'unrealistic', 'action', 'sequence', 'film', 'still', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'Alain', 'escapes', 'taken', 'FBI', 'custody', 'forced', 'take', 'part', 'plot', 'retrieve', 'secret', 'list', 'bank.The', 'tone', 'Maximum', 'Risk', 'rarely', 'being', 'deadly', 'serious', 'Jean-Claude', 'straight', 'not', 'get', 'too', 'cute', 'situations', 'mostly', 'stay', 'limits', 'believability', 'resulting', 'very', 'tight', 'credible', 'film', 'action', 'sequences', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'top', 'yet', 'enough', 'edginess', 'keep', 'things', 'being', 'too', 'pedestrian', 'even', '2010', 'standards', 'Nicely', 'paced', 'bolstered', 'solid', 'performances', 'van', 'Damme', 'Henstridge', 'film', 'full', 'circle', 'finishing', 'violent', 'flourish', 'south', 'France', 'Things', 'must', 'have', 'clicked', 'Lam', 'van', 'Damme', 'would', 'also', 'team', 'up', 'Replicant', '2001', 'Hell', '2003']",N/A
