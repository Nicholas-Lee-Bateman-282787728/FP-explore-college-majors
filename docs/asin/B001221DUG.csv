This movie has a terrible story, Russian terrorists are using Bats as a weapon and America is sending in Spec Ops to stop them. This movie isn't completely terrible, the action scenes are moderately entertaining, I mean you won't die if you watch this movie. I've seen this movie twice and don't hate it, but am definitely not a die hard fan. This movie is on the sci-fi channel and if you've seen their movies you know what its like. The effects are just okay but the action scenes are pretty unrealistic.Now the DVDThe DVD does not have too many extras, in fact all it has is a few deleted scenes. I don't recommend you buy the DVD without watching the movie. (It can be seen on the sci-fi channel).",2,This movie was not really good,1283990400,"09 9, 2010",2010,845,"['movie', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'however', 'like', 'movie', 'Call', 'Duty', '4', 'Modern', 'Warfare', 'not', 'bats', 'terrorists', 'movie', 'terrible', 'story', 'Russian', 'terrorists', 'are', 'using', 'Bats', 'weapon', 'America', 'sending', 'Spec', 'Ops', 'stop', 'movie', ""n't"", 'completely', 'terrible', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'moderately', 'entertaining', 'mean', 'wo', ""n't"", 'die', 'watch', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'am', 'definitely', 'not', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'movie', 'sci-fi', 'channel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'know', 'what', 'like', 'effects', 'are', 'just', 'okay', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'unrealistic.Now', 'DVDThe', 'DVD', 'not', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'extras', 'fact', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buy', 'DVD', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'sci-fi', 'channel']",Bats: Human Harvest
1134341,AYWSFRCIMOAYE,B001221DUG,Cestmoi,"[3, 4]",This film is one of the worst of all times. The fighting and shooting scenes look absolutely fake. The acting is so terrible it seemed the actors and actresses were reading the dialogues from a book! The special effects are like ... NO EFFECTS at all. There's no suspenseful or scary moment either.It should be zero star.

Plays like a bad SciFi Channel movie, if you get my drift. My teen daughter and I put this on the other night. I usually can give any move the benefit of the doubt and find something, anything worthwhile, but about half way through she says, &#34;Dad, this sucks.&#34; She was right.

1134343,A3B0C2DFYUQ9IK,B001221DUG,"James A. Brice ""blackwoodalgernon""","[0, 0]","Pollyanna McIntosh has received cult-like credit for her awesome portrayal of a feral cannibal woman in the movie The Woman now available on Netflix.  She also showed her above-average acting ability in The 9 Lives of Mara, and other films that she has had bit parts in such as The Acid House.  The Russian operative character she portrays in this movie shows us that she can act even in a horrible movie, and yes, Bats is an awful film.  The idea of flesh-eating bats is not very interesting in itself, and when it is mixed with an unbelievable story line and script it is intolerable.  Shot on a shoestring budget, the military scenes are always cheezy and obviously shot by someone who has no knowledge of military operations.  Sometimes the characters are seen pointing their guns nonchalantly at a buddie's head, totally unaware of what they are doing and showing the director's ignorance of even the most basic gun safety rules.  The bats look like something from a Shrek movie, but are nowehere near as menacing or believable as say, the flying monkeys from The Wizard of Oz. The unforgivable sin is that the bats along with the storyline, characters and plot are flat out boring.  No movie can overcome that deadly combo.
