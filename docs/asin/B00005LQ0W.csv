However, a lot of them chose Not to - including Kelly Martin ( Christy ) and Randall Batinkoff ( David).These newer Christy films were taken from Catherine Marshall's last known scribblings and notes she had written down for a sequel to the actual Christy Novel.  ""The producers drew Christy's ultimate romantic decision from notes for an unfinished sequel Christy novel that were discovered among Catherine Marshall's possessions after her death.""While I too enjoy the original TV Series with Kelly Martin, I like these 3 new Christy movies just as much - if not more!  :)  I had been hunting down the DVDs of them and finally found them.  Sadly with the Kelly Martin version, they did not stay faithful to the book in a lot of ways.I can highly recommend these newer Christy DVDs completely.  They are:  1.

I wasn't dissapointed. 'Choices of the Heart' was the best of the 3 and I haven't yet gotten sick of watching it. When the series came out and ended abruptly, I was dissapointed to say the least. And thought that we would never know who she chooses...now we do. ;)The ONLY problem I had with the movie was the actors who played David, Miss Alice, Christy and the kids. Although all three of the main characters were talented, I felt that there was alot of over and underacting, and at times it didn't seem real. The kids were too clean and the hair-dos and clothes were too nice for the time era and hardships they lived. I missed Kellie Martin as Christy. To me, she'll always be christy..she was born for the part. To be honest, if it wasn't for Stewart Finlay McLennan (who played the original character Neil in the series) I probably wouldn't have been interested in this movie at all.Other than that, I highly reccomend all three movies.

In ""Return to Cutter Gap"", with the exception of Stewart Finlay McLennan as Dr MacNeill, the rest of the original cast has been replaced, and the changes are startling to say the least - Lauren Lee Smith appears stilted in her role in this first episode, and the acting by the other cast members, such as Sam Waterston [replacing Randall Batinkoff] as preacher David, and Dianne Ladd as Ms Alice [replacing the incomparable Tyne Daly] seem ill at ease in their respective role. The storyline for ""Return to Cutter Gap"" showed potential but was rather abysmally executed - it focuses on the building of a road into Cutter Gap and the negative reaction of the residents. Christy is blamed for the spate of robberies occurring in the area as the residents believe outsiders are to blame for their problems.  All in all, ""Return to Cutter Gap"" was a rather lackluster production compared to the original series.However, the second episode 'A Change of Seasons"" and the final in this series "" A New Beginning"" were vast improvements on ""Return to Cutter Gap"". My review for ""A Change of Seasons"" can be viewed under that DVD description.In ""A New Beginning"", Christy is faced with a confusing and difficult decision when Dr MacNeill returns to Cutter Gap proposing marriage, even though Christy has already accepted David's proposal and the marriage date is approaching. A fierce storm causes Christy to be thrown into Dr MacNeill's company and the pair seek shelter at a remote cabin. Dr MacNeill nurses Christy back to health from a raging fever and in the process, Christy makes an important discovery about her feelings for both David and MacNeill and her future.The two episodes following the weakly-executed ""Return to Cutter Gap"" are well-directed and the actors all seem to be more comfortable with their respective roles.This is wholesome family entertainment and I highly recommend them.",4,Wholesome and wonderful,1236211200,"03 5, 2009",2009,2282,"['Firstly', 'noticed', 'when', 'attempted', 'post', 'earlier', 'review', 'Return', 'Cutter', 'Gap', 'same', 'review', 'appeared', 'A', 'New', 'Beginning', 'so', 'am', 'going', 'do', 'review', 'episodes', 'Return', 'Cutter', 'Gap', 'where', 'original', 'series', 'ended', 'one', 'Kellie', 'Martin', 'Christy', 'original', 'series', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'beloved', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Return', 'Cutter', 'Gap', 'exception', 'Stewart', 'Finlay', 'McLennan', 'Dr', 'MacNeill', 'rest', 'original', 'cast', 'been', 'replaced', 'changes', 'are', 'startling', 'say', 'least', 'Lauren', 'Lee', 'Smith', 'stilted', 'role', 'first', 'episode', 'acting', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'such', 'Sam', 'Waterston', '[', 'replacing', 'Randall', 'Batinkoff', ']', 'preacher', 'David', 'Dianne', 'Ladd', 'Ms', 'Alice', '[', 'replacing', 'incomparable', 'Tyne', 'Daly', ']', 'seem', 'ill', 'ease', 'respective', 'role', 'storyline', 'Return', 'Cutter', 'Gap', 'showed', 'potential', 'was', 'rather', 'abysmally', 'executed', 'building', 'road', 'Cutter', 'Gap', 'negative', 'reaction', 'residents', 'Christy', 'blamed', 'spate', 'robberies', 'occurring', 'area', 'residents', 'believe', 'outsiders', 'are', 'blame', 'problems', 'Return', 'Cutter', 'Gap', 'was', 'rather', 'lackluster', 'production', 'compared', 'original', 'series.However', 'second', 'episode', 'Change', 'Seasons', 'final', 'series', 'A', 'New', 'Beginning', 'were', 'vast', 'improvements', 'Return', 'Cutter', 'Gap', 'review', 'A', 'Change', 'Seasons', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'A', 'New', 'Beginning', 'Christy', 'faced', 'confusing', 'difficult', 'decision', 'when', 'Dr', 'MacNeill', 'Cutter', 'Gap', 'proposing', 'marriage', 'even', 'Christy', 'already', 'accepted', 'David', 'proposal', 'marriage', 'date', 'approaching', 'fierce', 'storm', 'Christy', 'be', 'thrown', 'Dr', 'MacNeill', 'company', 'pair', 'seek', 'shelter', 'remote', 'cabin', 'Dr', 'MacNeill', 'Christy', 'back', 'health', 'raging', 'fever', 'process', 'Christy', 'important', 'discovery', 'feelings', 'David', 'MacNeill', 'future.The', 'two', 'episodes', 'following', 'weakly-executed', 'Return', 'Cutter', 'Gap', 'are', 'well-directed', 'actors', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'comfortable', 'respective', 'roles.This', 'wholesome', 'family', 'entertainment', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
