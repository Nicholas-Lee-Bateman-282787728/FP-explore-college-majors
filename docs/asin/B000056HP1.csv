It has a lot going for it The story kept my interest all the way both times I saw it (four years apart).The violence and profanity are not overdone, the main characters are very interesting and the story finishes with a unique twist.Actually, that twist is something you have to ponder to determine whether it makes sense. I am not sure it did. You'd have to watch this again soon and check on a few things. It's either very clever or its totally unfair to the viewer.It's nicely photographed and I bet it looks much better on this widescreen DVD than on the tape I viewed it on in the '90s.

This isn't one of them.""Under Suspicion"" is total cinematic fail, and the sad thing is that it had the chance to be something much better. Ninety-five percent of the movie is a bleak noir-style thriller about a man accused of a grotesque double murder, in which all the evidence seems to be pointing to him... and it's fine, until the moment when they throw in an absurd twist that rips apart the story.Tony Aaron (Neeson) was a cop in Brighton, until the night he left a stakeout so he could have sex with the suspect's wife. When the man tries to kill him (even chasing him naked out of the house), another cop is fatally wounded.Fast forward two years. A disgraced Tony is now a penniless private eye who specializes in divorce fraud -- basically he arranges for clients to sleep with his wife Hazel (Maggie O'Neill), so he can burst in and photograph them. Infidelity proven, instant divorce. But one night, he bursts in... and finds both his wife and the client, a wealthy artist named Stasio (Michael Almaz) shot dead.Tony quickly finds himself the prime suspect -- partly because Stasio's wife has an alibi, and partly because the cops all hate him. The only other suspect is Stasio's seductive mistress Angeline (Laura San Giacomo), who quickly embarks on a torrid affair with Tony. But as the evidence stacks up, Tony finds himself facing the noose unless his old partner Frank (Kenneth Cranham) can save him.""Under Suspicion"" seems like a fairly conventional murder mystery for the first 95%.  It has an interesting atmosphere -- sort of a British noir, with lots of rainy skies and grey buildings -- and the idea of a disgraced cop being framed is a compelling one. The story is a rather cliched, by-the-numbers one, but it's told competently.Most of the story is devoted to Tony desperately searching for proof that he didn't do the crime, when he isn't having softcore sex with Angeline. There's a lot of slow buildup to Tony's seeming demise, but it's wrapped up in a solid manner...... until the last ten minutes. Without revealing too much... there is a twist. It tries to subvert everything that you expected, and instead it completely destroys everything that has come before it. It tears the plot full of more holes than a pair of pantyhose dragged through a briar patch. NOTHING makes sense after this -- primarily because the twist relies on the murderer being the luckiest person in the world, and possibly the stupidest.One thing I cannot criticize is Liam Neeson. He does an excellent job as Tony, alternating between wild desperation and puppy-eyed melancholy -- and you really do get the sense of someone who has lived a hard life, and is likely to continue that way.  Cranham also gives a solid performance as Tony's ex-partner, who still has a soft spot for the perennial screwup.Sadly, san Giacomo really doesn't give a very good performance. She tries to play the noir femme fatale, but there's something oddly artificial about most of what she says and does.""Under Suspicion"" would have been a passable little thriller (with a side of softcore sex) if the filmmakers hadn't tried too hard to be clever. As it is, the only really good thing in the end is Neeson's performance.",1,Tears itself full of holes (spoilers),1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,3327,"['became', 'megastar', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'did', 'lot', 'interesting', 'roles', 'smaller-scale', 'movies', ""n't"", 'one', 'Suspicion', 'total', 'cinematic', 'fail', 'sad', 'thing', 'had', 'chance', 'be', 'something', 'much', 'better', 'Ninety-five', 'percent', 'movie', 'bleak', 'noir-style', 'thriller', 'man', 'accused', 'grotesque', 'double', 'murder', 'evidence', 'be', 'pointing', 'fine', 'moment', 'when', 'throw', 'absurd', 'twist', 'apart', 'story.Tony', 'Aaron', 'Neeson', 'was', 'cop', 'Brighton', 'night', 'left', 'stakeout', 'could', 'have', 'sex', 'suspect', 'wife', 'When', 'man', 'kill', 'even', 'chasing', 'naked', 'house', 'cop', 'fatally', 'wounded.Fast', 'forward', 'two', 'years', 'disgraced', 'Tony', 'now', 'penniless', 'private', 'eye', 'who', 'divorce', 'fraud', 'basically', 'clients', 'sleep', 'wife', 'Hazel', 'Maggie', ""O'Neill"", 'can', 'burst', 'photograph', 'Infidelity', 'proven', 'instant', 'divorce', 'one', 'night', 'wife', 'client', 'wealthy', 'artist', 'named', 'Stasio', 'Michael', 'Almaz', 'shot', 'dead.Tony', 'quickly', 'prime', 'suspect', 'partly', 'Stasio', 'wife', 'alibi', 'partly', 'cops', 'hate', 'only', 'other', 'suspect', 'Stasio', 'seductive', 'mistress', 'Angeline', 'Laura', 'San', 'Giacomo', 'who', 'quickly', 'torrid', 'affair', 'Tony', 'evidence', 'up', 'Tony', 'facing', 'noose', 'old', 'partner', 'Frank', 'Kenneth', 'Cranham', 'can', 'save', 'Suspicion', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'murder', 'mystery', 'first', '95', '%', 'interesting', 'atmosphere', 'sort', 'British', 'noir', 'lots', 'rainy', 'skies', 'grey', 'buildings', 'idea', 'disgraced', 'cop', 'being', 'framed', 'compelling', 'one', 'story', 'rather', 'cliched', 'by-the-numbers', 'one', 'told', 'competently.Most', 'story', 'devoted', 'Tony', 'desperately', 'searching', 'proof', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'crime', 'when', ""n't"", 'having', 'softcore', 'sex', 'Angeline', 'lot', 'slow', 'buildup', 'Tony', 'seeming', 'demise', 'wrapped', 'up', 'solid', 'manner', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'twist', 'subvert', 'everything', 'expected', 'instead', 'completely', 'everything', 'come', 'plot', 'full', 'more', 'holes', 'pair', 'pantyhose', 'dragged', 'briar', 'patch', 'NOTHING', 'sense', 'primarily', 'twist', 'relies', 'murderer', 'being', 'luckiest', 'person', 'world', 'possibly', 'stupidest.One', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'criticize', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'excellent', 'job', 'Tony', 'alternating', 'wild', 'desperation', 'puppy-eyed', 'melancholy', 'really', 'do', 'get', 'sense', 'someone', 'who', 'lived', 'hard', 'life', 'likely', 'continue', 'way', 'Cranham', 'also', 'solid', 'performance', 'Tony', 'ex-partner', 'who', 'still', 'soft', 'spot', 'perennial', 'screwup.Sadly', 'san', 'Giacomo', 'really', ""n't"", 'give', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'play', 'noir', 'femme', 'fatale', 'something', 'oddly', 'artificial', 'most', 'what', 'Suspicion', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'passable', 'little', 'thriller', 'side', 'softcore', 'sex', 'filmmakers', 'had', ""n't"", 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'clever', 'only', 'really', 'good', 'thing', 'end', 'Neeson', 'performance']",N/A
