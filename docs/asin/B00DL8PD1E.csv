I was expecting a great message from Pastor Graham and this was little more than opinions from other people. Even at the age of 95, Billy Graham could have given a great message that this country needs to hear at this time in history. I don't think he was offered the chance to preach on this DVD. He could have done a message, in segments, using a Tele-Promp-Ter. Airing this DVD will Pastor Graham's name on it is a complete disservice to this great man of God. For months the BGEA had this all hyped-up and we, as a family, were all excited to view the program. I told people at our church about it and they were excited to view it as well. They all came away with the same evaluation as I did.

1659135,AMSALM0GG880Q,B00DL8PD1E,Hawk911,"[9, 9]","The greatest act of love that any person can do to another is to share with them the truth, love and hope that is only found through our Lord and savior Jesus Christ.This wonderful DVD set continues sharing that. It has a two fold purpose:1. share the truth, hope and love of Jesus to those that do not know the Lord and are lost so that they can find the answer and joy of eternal life2. to help train believers so that they can share that message to others who are lost.It is comprised of 3 new messages, footage and comments about his mission of doing God's work, discipleship training and 3 classic sermons.The 3 new messages share the truth and hope of the gospel by mixing testimonies of various people with words from Billy Graham both current and from classic sermons. The attempt here is a modern clear cut message of truth and it works.The discipleship training is aimed at all believers from all walks of life, whether they are a sunday school teacher, teenager, elderly lady, white collar, blue collar, student etc.. There are two important things in life. To be saved and then to help share the truth so others may be saved through Christ. For even if we live to be 100, we are only here on earth for a brief moment, and then we spend an eternity either in heaven or hell. Making disciples and sharing the truth is not just the job of the preachers and people on missions to other countries.. If we know Christ as our savior it's our job and it begins 1 step out of our door.The classic sermons included on Disc 3 are from previous crusades and are wonderful. Don't let the fact that they are old recordings tarnish your thoughts. The truth then is the truth now. The truth does not expire. If Billy Graham was able, he'd still say the same thing today. In fact, he does. Just calmer and more quiet.Many people know of the old testament 'ten commandments' but when God came into the world as a man, Jesus himself gave us about 50 commands and said ""if you love me, keep my commandments"". Such commands included ""love your neighbor, deny yourself, take the narrow gate, repent, pray for laborers, be a servant..."" etc...However the great command was to go and make disciples.The term 'christian' is used 3 times in the bible whereas the term 'disciple' is used about 250 times. We are called to be disciples. A disciple is someone who has been saved by faith and grace and belongs to the Lord. A disciple's prime directive is to go make other disciples by sharing God with others.The early followers knew this and obeyed. With only a handful of people they changed the world.Billy Graham's ministry knows this and the only way America can be saved from it's rapid downfall is by making disciples, followers of Jesus, who make other disciples who in turn make other disciples.God is love, truth and the answer. He loves us and wants us to love him. He created us nd gave us free will to either believe and follow him or to do our own selfish ways. Whether you are lost and seeking an answer or have been saved by the Lord for decades, this DVD set is worth watching and sharing with all those you care about.  It's important.
