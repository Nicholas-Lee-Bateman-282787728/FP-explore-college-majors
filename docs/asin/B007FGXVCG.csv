In some cases the music is louder than the singer so with the poor quality it is hard to understand.  When you go into the music listing, remember to go all the way to play all on each list or else it will go back after playing each song. There was a complete break between each song (black screen) instead of making it a continues performance.  When they put performances in they are not in order which is no problem unless it shows them leaving then they are back to do another song. We were just disappointed with the whole thing.

Yes true the quality is not top on all the performance but you can always reduce the size of the picture from your dvd player and the transformation will be great.All these shows that were filmed at Church street sattion in Orlando have that low quality picture, The rock and rol shows too have the same problem, but like I was sayiong it s often your only chance to get something live from these artists.Finally how lazy do people get the big issue is having to use your REMOTE. Wow you press play all at the artist of your choice and get usually betweene 3 to 6 songs.
