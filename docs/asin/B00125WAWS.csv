Based on a true story, the film takes us to Wiley, an African-American Methodist college in Texas during the Depression in 1935.  Inspiring, harrowing, and uplifting, the film gives proper transcendence especially during a time and place that didn't offer many breaks.We are first introduced to Professor Polson (Denzel Washington), a tenacious idealist and poet.  As professor at Wiley and debate coach, he hardly yields on any of his principles.  Inspired by the man who is named for the heinous lynching, Polson tells his debate recruits that it was in Lynch's best interests to keep Black people, ""Physically strong, but psychologically weak.""  It is with this explanation that we understand his zealous approach to his debate team, and why he makes their training so rigorous.Entering the field are forty-five tryouts, of which, only four will be selected:  two representatives and two alternates.  Of the three who make it, we get to know Henry Lowe (Nate Parker) a charismatic and bright figurehead who is easily distracted by beautiful women and hard liquor.  Joining him are Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett), the first young woman to join the debate team, and James Farmer, Jr. (Denzel Whitaker)  forever young at age 14, but an ever resourceful scholar and son of a minister, James Farmer, Sr. (Forrest Whitaker).  [No real life relations.]  As he notices a romance start to blossom between his teammates, his resentment grows. As the one who researches many of the arguments Henry and Samantha provide on the podium,  he is put on the sidelines both in terms of the limelight and the love light.As you might guess, Wiley enjoys a certain amount of success, and the price of success is opposition.  Polson spends a great deal of his time and rhetorical talent organizing a sharecroppers' union, much to the chagrin of Sheriff Dozier (John Heard) who won't have unrest in his sleepy Texas town.  In one scene the Farmer family is making a trek by car on a rural country road as they pass a poor white farm.  The children who seem so mischievous run alongside the car as they pass along, unaccustomed to seeing a ""Negro"" with an automobile.  Perhaps distracted by the nearby children, he runs over a pig, and in a quietly intense exchange between Farmer, Sr. and the owner, is extorted of a month's paycheck.  This reminded me of a similar scene in the 1980's movie, `Centennial,' and showed the contrast between a good film with a similar theme and a great one.In another part, the debate team makes their way by night to their debate destination when they come across a truly horrible sight.  What they see through the windshield reveals a mob of white men who don't like having their heinous deeds brought to light.  Shaken, they each try to come to cope with their discovery as they often lose focus and courage in the face of Polson's opposition and the violence laid before them.Always kept in check by their unyielding leader, the debate team holds out for all possible opportunity.  Audacious but unflinching, Polson invites Harvard to a debate match. One of the master strokes of the movie is how the debates and their topics match the action that goes on all around them.  Show and tell is mixed expertly for a meaningful movie experience.`The Great Debaters' is a top-echelon movie experience.  Although it is reminiscent of movies likeMississippi Burning,To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition), andAkeelah and the Beeit captures a fulfilling true life story in a way that doesn't feel like rehash or contain a wasted scene.

1134956,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B00125WAWS,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[3, 3]","This movie takes us back to an ugly time in U.S. history -- the Jim Crow era. In a segregated little town in Texas, the African American teachers and students of tiny Wiley College pursue excellence in education and recruit a world-class debate team, good enough to take on the debaters of Harvard and win.I'm not sure how much of this movie is fact and how much fiction but it pushed all the right buttons with me. Denzel Washington, who directed, plays the debate coach Melvin Tolson. He is fiercely intelligent, proud, politically active, angry, fearless and demanding. Washington makes him truly convincing. His debate team includes a 14-year-old budding genius and a brave young woman breaking gender and race barriers as well as a philanderer with a roving eye. Forest Whitaker plays the 14 year-old's father, a preacher with an angry exterior but a  soft heart.The movie explicitly shows the humiliations blacks suffered living in the South, including a horrific lynching. It portrays the self-hatred such scenes inspired in blacks who had to suffer them without the power to do anything about them.One interesting aspect for me is the movie's constant refrain that education is the way out of this poverty and humiliation. By training their intellects, African Americans can reclaim their autonomy, confront their oppressors and build a better life, the movie argues.I am afraid this lesson has been lost somewhere along the way. In those days, people paid good money to watch colleges debates and they were even boradcast on national radio. Today, we're all about glorifying rap singers and basketball players. All our communities, but especially the African American community, are the poorer because of it.The documentary accompanying this movie shows some of the real-life characters who inspired it. You listen to those fierce, passionate, articulate, educated voices and you not only are filled with admiration for them but you also bemoan the state we've reached now.This movie isn't perfect. It's a little formulaic perhaps. But its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. It's good entertainment that also carries a message we need to hear.",5,Stirring reminder of Jim Crow and the courage of those who overcame it,1220745600,"09 7, 2008",2008,2156,"['movie', 'back', 'ugly', 'time', 'U.S.', 'history', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'era', 'segregated', 'little', 'town', 'Texas', 'African', 'American', 'teachers', 'students', 'tiny', 'Wiley', 'College', 'pursue', 'excellence', 'education', 'recruit', 'world-class', 'debate', 'team', 'good', 'enough', 'take', 'debaters', 'Harvard', 'win.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'movie', 'fact', 'how', 'much', 'fiction', 'pushed', 'right', 'buttons', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'directed', 'debate', 'coach', 'Melvin', 'Tolson', 'fiercely', 'intelligent', 'proud', 'politically', 'active', 'angry', 'fearless', 'demanding', 'Washington', 'truly', 'convincing', 'debate', 'team', '14-year-old', 'budding', 'genius', 'brave', 'young', 'woman', 'breaking', 'gender', 'race', 'barriers', 'as', 'well', 'philanderer', 'roving', 'eye', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', '14', 'year-old', 'father', 'preacher', 'angry', 'exterior', 'soft', 'heart.The', 'movie', 'explicitly', 'humiliations', 'blacks', 'suffered', 'living', 'South', 'including', 'horrific', 'lynching', 'self-hatred', 'such', 'scenes', 'inspired', 'blacks', 'who', 'had', 'suffer', 'power', 'do', 'anything', 'them.One', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'movie', 'constant', 'refrain', 'education', 'way', 'poverty', 'humiliation', 'training', 'intellects', 'African', 'Americans', 'can', 'reclaim', 'autonomy', 'confront', 'oppressors', 'build', 'better', 'life', 'movie', 'argues.I', 'am', 'afraid', 'lesson', 'been', 'lost', 'somewhere', 'way', 'days', 'people', 'paid', 'good', 'money', 'watch', 'colleges', 'debates', 'were', 'even', 'boradcast', 'national', 'radio', 'Today', ""'re"", 'glorifying', 'rap', 'singers', 'basketball', 'players', 'communities', 'especially', 'African', 'American', 'community', 'are', 'poorer', 'it.The', 'documentary', 'accompanying', 'movie', 'real-life', 'characters', 'who', 'inspired', 'listen', 'fierce', 'passionate', 'articulate', 'educated', 'voices', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'filled', 'admiration', 'also', 'bemoan', 'state', ""'ve"", 'reached', 'now.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'little', 'formulaic', 'perhaps', 'strengths', 'far', 'outweigh', 'weaknesses', 'good', 'entertainment', 'also', 'message', 'need', 'hear']",N/A
1134957,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00125WAWS,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Although there is some confusion, if not controversy, surrounding the facts on which this commercial film ""The Great Debaters"" is based it is nevertheless a well-done piece of cinema. When one says the name Denzel Washington, who starred in and directed the film, and adds the imprimatur of Ophrah Winfrey as producer then those factors alone usually insure a well thought out presentation. Add in a slice of pre-1960's civil rights movement Southern Jim Crow black history surrounding the extraordinary abilities of the debate team at Wiley College, a small black Texas college, and the headline of this entry - ""A Case Of Black Pride""- tells the tale.The subject matter of this film: the trials and tribulations of a debate team as it tries to make its mark in the intellectual world would not, on the face it, seem to be a natural subject for a two hour film. Nor would the fact that this debate team was composed of and led by the black ""talented tenth"" of the 1930's, including James Farmer, Jr. who would later will fame as a main stream ""establishment"" civil rights leader (and the scorn of younger black militants in the 1960's). However it does. The glue here is the performance of Denzel Washington as the somewhat mysterious hard-driving Northern black intellectual (and friend of Langston Hughes whose work in Spain in the 1930's I have explored elsewhere in this space). Professor Tolson, however, is more than some eccentric college don because he has enlisted in the struggle (or was sent, probably by the Communist or Socialist Party who were both organizing this strata of the agrarian working class in the South at the time) to organize the desperately poor black and white Texas sharecroppers. That story is also a subject worthy of separate discussion at a later time.As the story unfolds we get a glimpse at black college life in the 1930's with its marching bands, its social life and its pecking orders. What that part of the film looked like was the universality of the college experience, except here everyone was black. The mere fact of being in college in the 1930's, at the height of the Great Depression meant that these student were training to be part of the black elite. Along the way, however, a different reality intrudes, as we are also exposed to black life in the South- Jim Crow style, even for W.E.B. Dubois' ""talented tenth"".  Two of the most dramatic scenes in the movie are when Reverend James Farmer, Sr., by all accounts an extremely learned man if somewhat distant father, is humbled by some local ""white trash""-for merely driving while black and the seemingly obligatory gratuitous lynching of a black man that the debate team witnessed in its travels. Powerful stuff.The controversy surrounding the facts, if that is the case, is the question of whether the centerpiece of the 1935-36 debating season, a debate with the august Harvard University team actually occurred and whether the subject matter of this seminal debate was on the virtues and vices of civil disobedience. This would hardly be the first, and will probably not be the last, commercial film to ""juice up"" the story in order to create better dramatic tension. In short, to make it a ""feel good"" movie for the black and progressive audiences that I assume it was intended to reach. That should not take away from the achievements of this debate team, the courage of Professor Tolson in organizing Southern sharecroppers or the hard reality of ""lynch law"" in the Jim Crow South of the 1930's. Well acted, well thought out and well-intended it deserves a careful watching.

I really respected the idea of this film and had very high expectations-that was foolish of me.In the era of political correctness, the concept of using your mind, ideas and logic as weopens against the status quo seemed worthy of Orwell. Just the idea that there might be a truth to search out and fight for, shines a light in our contemporary relativistic darkness. However the culminating ""debate"" of this film seemed like little more than a righteous preaching/sob story contest, even a propaganda contest.  Very funny how none of these ""great debators"" (those of Harvard or our protagonists) seem to have any awareness of things like logical fallacies, or any of the other integrities (now long lost) of classical debate.  Both teams indulge in emotionalistic ad hominem and reuctio ad absurdium attacks and more.  The lead actress whines and moans as if she is at a pentecostal meeting worthy of Borat, yet the audience gushes and claps at her as if on exstasy.  More laughable, one of the debators of the harvard team makes an argument ad Hitlerum-keep in mind this is the thirties, Hitler would first become Time magazines man of the year, before becoming the post world war II totem of all evil.  So in addition to it showing the ridiculousness of the debate, it is anoachronistic.  THe whole movie is so.

This is the story of one brilliant teacher and four (reduced to three) brilliant students who made history, and did it right.Denzel Washington (whom I have adored ever since The Pelican Brief, and who plays the black men who are both smart and sexy almost as well as Sidney Poitier) plays Melvin Tolson. We are told he went on from tiny Wiley College in Texas to become famous as a poet. I guess I'll have to look up some of his works, although I'm not much of a poetry buff. Professor Tolson has two sides: the demanding coach of the Wiley College debate team, and activist union organizer of the southern sharecroppers.This is 1936 in the Jim Crow south. Things get nasty. At one point, the debate team comes across a lynch mob and the charred body of their victim hanging from a tree. Hot-headed Henry Lowe (passionately played by Nate Parker) wants to get out of the car and cut down the corpse, but his team-mates persuade him to stay in the car as they manage to make their way through the lynch mob and into the clear, but only just barely.Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett) is the only girl on the team, and as brilliant as she is pretty. She falls in love with Henry Lowe, who breaks her heart, while James Farmer, Jr. (Denzel Whitaker) watches her and pines with unrequited love. But he's only 14, for all he is a college student, and short and round. Brilliant, and a genuinely nice kid, the son of brilliant preacher James Farmer, Sr. (played by Forest Whitaker, no doubt Denzel's father).Yes, there are also uneducated negroes (that's what they were called in 1936; or ""colored"") in the story, but mostly the ones showing considerable injuries from contact with the sheriff or the Texas Rangers. Those and the ones who managed to avoid violence but also probably never even saw the inside of a school room.It was hard enough to go to college at all in the 1930s, let alone being black, let alone in the south.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[16, 20]","THE GREAT DEBATERS is an interesting historical look at the first black debating team to ever compete at a white college. And although it is interesting as a film, it isn't very historically accurate.The good is that, as a film viewer, you care about the main characters. Denzel Washington (Deja Vu) stars in -- and directs -- this ethnically challenging movie, and does so in his usually adequate way. Melvin B. Tolson (Washington) is the teacher of the Wiley College debate team in 1935 Texas. His team is comprised of three bright young black people: Henry Lowe (Nate Parker), an overly-clever man with a possible future ...if he can stay out of harm's way; Samantha Brooke (Jurnee Smollett,House, M.D.), the first female debater in Wiley College history; and James Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker), a chubby lad with a penchant for research.Growing up in the South (that's South with a capital ""S""), the team must not only fight to win debates against local colleges, but must also battle the prejudices of the times. They come into close contact with ignorance and racism on a daily basis. Even their teacher, Mr. Tolson, is threatened at various crossroads.This is what stood out in the film ...and rightfully so. But there were some serious flaws in the film, too. The biggest was the debates themselves. Many of them were based on emotion and not facts and statistics. It would've also been nice to have had the names of the actual persons within the film and not some made-up ones (some were real, like Tolson, but others were not).Some praise has to be made for Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland) as Dr. James Farmer Sr. His role was understated and held much of the powerful, emotional punch toward the final third of the movie, especially when his son James Jr. discovers why his father reacts the way he does during an embarrassing prejudicial moment.That Wiley's black debaters made it to Harvard and debated their team is now history. But I would've liked to have seen more of the actual history than this Hollywooded version. Still, it's an interesting movie that'll give many viewers an insight into something they probably knew nothing about.",3,Flawed But Interesting,1215907200,"07 13, 2008",2008,2165,"['GREAT', 'DEBATERS', 'interesting', 'historical', 'look', 'first', 'black', 'debating', 'team', 'ever', 'compete', 'white', 'college', 'interesting', 'film', ""n't"", 'very', 'historically', 'accurate.The', 'good', 'that', 'film', 'viewer', 'care', 'main', 'characters', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Deja', 'Vu', 'directs', 'ethnically', 'challenging', 'movie', 'so', 'usually', 'adequate', 'way', 'Melvin', 'B.', 'Tolson', 'Washington', 'teacher', 'Wiley', 'College', 'debate', 'team', '1935', 'Texas', 'team', 'comprised', 'three', 'bright', 'young', 'black', 'people', 'Henry', 'Lowe', 'Nate', 'Parker', 'overly-clever', 'man', 'possible', 'future', 'can', 'stay', 'harm', 'way', 'Samantha', 'Brooke', 'Jurnee', 'Smollett', 'House', 'M.D', 'first', 'female', 'debater', 'Wiley', 'College', 'history', 'James', 'Farmer', 'Jr.', 'Denzel', 'Whitaker', 'chubby', 'lad', 'penchant', 'research.Growing', 'up', 'South', 'South', 'capital', 'S', 'team', 'must', 'not', 'only', 'fight', 'win', 'debates', 'local', 'colleges', 'must', 'also', 'battle', 'prejudices', 'times', 'come', 'close', 'contact', 'ignorance', 'racism', 'daily', 'basis', 'Even', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Tolson', 'threatened', 'various', 'crossroads.This', 'what', 'stood', 'out', 'film', 'rightfully', 'so', 'were', 'serious', 'flaws', 'film', 'too', 'biggest', 'was', 'debates', 'Many', 'were', 'based', 'emotion', 'not', 'facts', 'statistics', 'would', ""'ve"", 'also', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'had', 'names', 'actual', 'persons', 'film', 'not', 'made-up', 'ones', 'were', 'real', 'Tolson', 'others', 'were', 'not', '.Some', 'praise', 'be', 'made', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'Dr.', 'James', 'Farmer', 'Sr.', 'role', 'was', 'understated', 'held', 'much', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'punch', 'final', 'third', 'movie', 'especially', 'when', 'son', 'James', 'Jr.', 'why', 'father', 'way', 'embarrassing', 'prejudicial', 'moment.That', 'Wiley', 'black', 'debaters', 'made', 'Harvard', 'debated', 'team', 'now', 'history', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'actual', 'history', 'Hollywooded', 'version', 'Still', 'interesting', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'give', 'many', 'viewers', 'insight', 'something', 'probably', 'knew', 'nothing', 'about']",N/A

1134974,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00125WAWS,Chris Pandolfi,"[16, 16]","Denzel Washington's ""The Great Debaters"" has that classic feel-good attitude about it, the kind that can be both uplifting and inspiring when we feel that life is getting us down. I admit that sounds a little hokey. I also admit that the story is somewhat predictable, especially as it nears the end. But the strengths of this film far outweigh the weaknesses--this is a pleasant and enjoyable story, one in which overcoming adversity is not only the overall theme, but also the literal driving force of the plot. I use the word ""plot"" because I have no way of knowing how accurately it interprets real life; the year 1935 saw the debate team from Marshall, Texas' all black Wiley College compete with several major, mostly white universities. Leading Wiley's team was Melvin B. Tolson, an African American English professor who stirred up controversy not only because of his race, but also because of his radical political beliefs.In the film, Denzel Washington portrays Tolson as a motivating but firm man of principle, believing that a debate can only be won through a strict regiment of reason and logic. The beginning of the semester sees the formation of a new debate team, and out of the forty-five students who try out, only four are chosen. One is Henry Lowe (Nate Parker), a young man so disillusioned by life that he drowns his sorrows in reckless behavior: he drinks; he womanizes; he gets into fights with dangerous people. He's also Tolson's mental and emotional equal--both are strong-willed and stubborn, and both are willing to match wits with each other. The second student is Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett), the first woman to ever be on Wiley's debate team. The feelings between her and Henry are strong, if a little stormy: while she does enjoy the occasional party, she doesn't appreciate the way he deals with his pain.The third student is James Farmer, Jr. (Denzel Whitaker), who must have been brilliant since he was in college at age fourteen. He also has feelings for Samantha, but because she only sees him as a friend, he constantly feels rejected. It doesn't help that he's always assigned as the debate team's researcher; he'd like the chance to actually debate an opposing team. His drive to succeed academically was most likely brought on by his father (Forest Whitaker, and in case you're wondering, no, he's not Denzel Whitaker's real life father); as a professor, he believes that nothing is more important than an education. It's so important to him, in fact, that some may perceive him as unsympathetic and needlessly stern.The fourth student is Hamilton Burgess (Jermaine Williams), who's eager to please everyone, especially Professor Tolson. I wish more about this character had been explored, because being the teacher's pet is always indicative of some deep-seeded need for attention. As it was, this character is the least developed. One thing we do learn is that his father doesn't agree with communism, which is bad since rumors have been spreading about Tolson's political beliefs; dressed as a simple farmer, he secretly meets with other farmers--both white and black--and discuss how they should form into a union, which would theoretically mean equal pay for every worker. One such meeting is interrupted by a group of white vigilantes who, as you might expect, prefer the status quo to progression. Leading this group is Dozier (John Heard), Marshall's bigoted sheriff.The major highlights of this film are the debate scenes, all of which are effective in their simplicity. They show how the Wiley team earned its reputation as undefeated champions, and the victories are so satisfying that it's easy to overlook the routine nature of the plot. Watching the students carrying off yet another trophy, I felt joyous and triumphant inside, and isn't that exactly the way I was supposed to feel? As a director, Washington has crafted a film that isn't at all unlike some of the better sports movies--it puts the characters through a series of trying circumstances only for them to arise as one and transcend. ""The Great Debaters"" definitely accomplishes that goal, and accomplishes it well.This is a good thing because some heavy-handed material is not spared on the audience. Keep in mind that this takes place in 1935 in the Jim Crow south; the film's single most disturbing scene shows a white mob surrounding a lynched black man, his dead body hanging from a tree branch and burnt beyond all recognition. Tolson and his debate team see this as they drive late at night, and in the end, they barely escape with their lives.The film culminates with the Wiley team debating Harvard University, an event so historic that it was broadcast all over the country via radio. I guess it doesn't matter that, in real life, Wiley never debated Harvard--for this story, Harvard is symbolic of that one major obstacle to be overcome. You're just going to have to see for yourselves if Wiley wins the debate; you might have some idea given the kind of film this is, but even if this is the case, I'd still recommend this movie to you. ""The Great Debaters"" is good-natured and inspirational, the kind of film we all want to see from time to time. In all honesty, it was an absolute pleasure to watch something so uplifting.

1134978,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00125WAWS,Craig Matteson,"[3, 3]","I enjoyed this movie very much.  Yes, I admit that I have enjoyed Denzel Washington on the screen since his St. Elsewhere days, but this movie offers so much beyond Denzel's very fine performance.This story is adapted from the true story set in 1935 of Wiley College, a small but excellent college for African-American students (although that term did not exist at the time of the story).  The characters on the team and the events are adapted (some are real, others are composites, some made up) to tell a powerful story.  Does it matter that the climactic battle with Harvard in the movie was against USC in real life?  And the Samantha Booke character is based on the real life Henrietta Wells who was on the 1930 debate team.Washington plays Melvin B. Tolson, who was the real life debate coach.  Actually, he was a brilliant poet and political activist who taught debate to use it as a tool in his activism.  What I really enjoyed about this portrayal of Tolson is that it neither denies his activism nor wears his radical views on its sleeve.  These views are acknowledged and put in the context of the social struggle for racial and economic equality for African Americans.  The issues the movie takes on are not about abstract theory, but the fight of those a generation from slavery to teach young brilliant minds and give them the tools they need to join the struggle for equality.  I found the reminders of what life in Texas (and American generally) in 1935 to be powerful and important to remember.  In fact, I think it is incredibly important to show this to young people who have never seen racism so plainly.Do not think that because this is about a debate team that it is a dull or abstract movie.  This is a passionate, fiery film that involves us emotionally while engaging us in our own intellectual debate with the film, with our own ideas, with out views about how society as evolved since the 1930s.  The characters are well drawn and finely portrayed.Forest Whitaker is terrific as Dr. James Farmer Sr. who ran Wiley in those years and was the father of the young 14 year old debater who grew up to found C.O.R.E. and lived a life committed to securing social justice for African Americans.  Nate Parker plays Henry Lowe in a way that reflects the character's intelligence, talent, and fragile emotional state.  Jurnee Smollett gives Samantha Booke intelligence, fire, and wit to spare.  John Heard is fine in the thankless job of the sheriff doing the bidding of the local racist powers that be.  And of course, Denzel Washington is superb as an actor in this movie, but deserves real praise as its director.  Oprah Winfrey produced it and deserves credit for giving us a moving and informative film.Recommended.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI 48103",5,A film to watch with your kids and grandkids and talk about with them,1212969600,"06 9, 2008",2008,2784,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'Yes', 'admit', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'screen', 'St', 'Elsewhere', 'days', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'Denzel', 'very', 'fine', 'performance.This', 'story', 'adapted', 'true', 'story', 'set', '1935', 'Wiley', 'College', 'small', 'excellent', 'college', 'African-American', 'students', 'term', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'time', 'story', 'characters', 'team', 'events', 'are', 'adapted', 'are', 'real', 'others', 'are', 'composites', 'made', 'up', 'tell', 'powerful', 'story', 'matter', 'climactic', 'battle', 'Harvard', 'movie', 'was', 'USC', 'real', 'life', 'Samantha', 'Booke', 'character', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'Henrietta', 'Wells', 'who', 'was', '1930', 'debate', 'team.Washington', 'Melvin', 'B.', 'Tolson', 'who', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'debate', 'coach', 'Actually', 'was', 'brilliant', 'poet', 'political', 'activist', 'who', 'taught', 'debate', 'use', 'tool', 'activism', 'What', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'portrayal', 'Tolson', 'activism', 'radical', 'views', 'sleeve', 'views', 'are', 'acknowledged', 'put', 'context', 'social', 'struggle', 'racial', 'economic', 'equality', 'African', 'Americans', 'issues', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'abstract', 'theory', 'fight', 'generation', 'slavery', 'teach', 'young', 'brilliant', 'minds', 'give', 'tools', 'need', 'join', 'struggle', 'equality', 'found', 'reminders', 'what', 'life', 'Texas', 'American', 'generally', '1935', 'be', 'powerful', 'important', 'remember', 'fact', 'think', 'incredibly', 'important', 'show', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'racism', 'so', 'plainly.Do', 'not', 'think', 'debate', 'team', 'dull', 'abstract', 'movie', 'passionate', 'fiery', 'film', 'emotionally', 'engaging', 'own', 'intellectual', 'debate', 'film', 'own', 'ideas', 'out', 'views', 'how', 'society', 'evolved', '1930s', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'drawn', 'finely', 'portrayed.Forest', 'Whitaker', 'terrific', 'Dr.', 'James', 'Farmer', 'Sr.', 'who', 'ran', 'Wiley', 'years', 'was', 'father', 'young', '14', 'year', 'old', 'debater', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'found', 'C.O.R.E', 'lived', 'life', 'committed', 'securing', 'social', 'justice', 'African', 'Americans', 'Nate', 'Parker', 'Henry', 'Lowe', 'way', 'character', 'intelligence', 'talent', 'fragile', 'emotional', 'state', 'Jurnee', 'Smollett', 'Samantha', 'Booke', 'intelligence', 'fire', 'wit', 'spare', 'John', 'Heard', 'fine', 'thankless', 'job', 'sheriff', 'doing', 'bidding', 'local', 'racist', 'powers', 'be', 'course', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'superb', 'actor', 'movie', 'real', 'praise', 'director', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'produced', 'credit', 'giving', 'moving', 'informative', 'film.Recommended.Reviewed', 'Craig', 'Matteson', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'MI', '48103']",N/A

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[2, 4]","Melvin Tolson, a professor of English and speech, was the organizer and coach of the Forensic Society of all-black Wiley College in Marshall, Texas.  He considered debate to be a blood sport in which victory was the only goal.  He was an autocratic individual who wrote the arguments that the debaters were instructed to deliver.  In his spare time, Tolson dressed plainly and risked his life to organize sharecroppers and other farm workers.  The year was 1935, a time when racism was ingrained in white southerners and workers were at the mercy of their employers.  It took enormous courage and commitment for Tolson to undertake such a dangerous task.  However, he was a man of conscience who refused to retreat from a struggle in which he so fervently believed.This is an old-fashioned movie about the importance of pride, self-respect, and dignity.  In lesser hands, such a film could have been boring, trite, and sentimental, but fortunately, Denzel Washington and screenwriter Robert Eisele imbue the film with passion and intelligence.  The charismatic Washington portrays the self-confident and dedicated Tolson with his usual flair.  His students initially worship him, but they eventually dare to challenge his dictatorial ways. One student in particular, the well-read and rebellious Henry Lowe, wonders why Tolson does not allow the debaters to formulate their own arguments.  Denzel Whitaker (no relation to the stars of the film) is James Farmer, Jr., a chubby teenager who is brilliant but a bit immature to be attending college.  He has a hopeless crush on Samantha Booke, played by the lovely and graceful Jurnee Smollett.  Booke, who is attracted to the flirtatious Lowe, hopes to become one of the few black female attorneys in the United States.  Forest Whitaker is magnetic as the stern James Farmer, Sr. a minister who is very demanding of his son but softens when he begins to appreciate James Jr.'s superb intellect and fine character.Lowe, Booke, and Farmer are the core of a champion debating team that makes history by challenging students who attend white colleges.  The final debate, which takes place at Harvard University, is absolutely electrifying.  As the contestants argue back and forth about the pros and cons of civil disobedience, the pair from Wiley College rise to the occasion.  What is most impressive is the fact that their words and ideas come not from their coach but from their own minds and hearts.""The Great Debaters"" is not just about winning verbal contests.  It realistically depicts the discrimination and oppression that minorities and workers suffered daily at the hands of the racists and tyrants who subjugated them.  There was no rule of law at the time.  John Heard has the thankless role of Sheriff Dozier, a redneck sheriff who is determined to see Tolson behind bars or preferably dead for daring to challenge the establishment.  What makes the movie particular memorable are the quiet scenes in which the actors' expressions speak volumes.  James Farmer, Jr. is appalled when his father is forced to demean himself before a pair of smirking low-class whites after he accidentally runs over their pig.  James Jr. wonders how a man whom he respects so much could possibly behave in such a servile manner.  Viewers will be revolted by another scene in which the debaters happen upon a mob after they have strung up a black man and set him on fire.  This was the reality of the Deep South.  Men like Tolson and Farmer were just a few of the pioneers who sacrificed so much so that their children would no longer be forced to bow their heads in shame.Although ""The Great Debaters"" breaks little new ground cinematically, it is a poignant film with fine performances, capable direction, good production values, and universal significance.  High school teachers would do well to assign this movie to their students.  It should provoke  a lively class discussion.",5,"""An unjust law is no law at all.""",1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,3919,"['Melvin', 'Tolson', 'professor', 'English', 'speech', 'was', 'organizer', 'coach', 'Forensic', 'Society', 'all-black', 'Wiley', 'College', 'Marshall', 'Texas', 'considered', 'debate', 'be', 'blood', 'sport', 'victory', 'was', 'only', 'goal', 'was', 'autocratic', 'individual', 'who', 'wrote', 'arguments', 'debaters', 'were', 'instructed', 'deliver', 'spare', 'time', 'Tolson', 'dressed', 'plainly', 'risked', 'life', 'organize', 'sharecroppers', 'other', 'farm', 'workers', 'year', 'was', '1935', 'time', 'when', 'racism', 'was', 'ingrained', 'white', 'southerners', 'workers', 'were', 'mercy', 'employers', 'took', 'enormous', 'courage', 'commitment', 'Tolson', 'undertake', 'such', 'dangerous', 'task', 'However', 'was', 'man', 'conscience', 'who', 'refused', 'retreat', 'struggle', 'so', 'fervently', 'believed.This', 'old-fashioned', 'movie', 'importance', 'pride', 'self-respect', 'dignity', 'lesser', 'hands', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'boring', 'trite', 'sentimental', 'fortunately', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'screenwriter', 'Robert', 'Eisele', 'film', 'passion', 'intelligence', 'charismatic', 'Washington', 'self-confident', 'dedicated', 'Tolson', 'usual', 'flair', 'students', 'initially', 'worship', 'eventually', 'dare', 'challenge', 'dictatorial', 'ways', 'One', 'student', 'particular', 'well-read', 'rebellious', 'Henry', 'Lowe', 'wonders', 'why', 'Tolson', 'not', 'allow', 'debaters', 'formulate', 'own', 'arguments', 'Denzel', 'Whitaker', 'relation', 'stars', 'film', 'James', 'Farmer', 'Jr.', 'chubby', 'teenager', 'who', 'brilliant', 'bit', 'immature', 'be', 'attending', 'college', 'hopeless', 'crush', 'Samantha', 'Booke', 'played', 'lovely', 'graceful', 'Jurnee', 'Smollett', 'Booke', 'who', 'attracted', 'flirtatious', 'Lowe', 'become', 'one', 'few', 'black', 'female', 'attorneys', 'United', 'States', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'magnetic', 'stern', 'James', 'Farmer', 'Sr.', 'minister', 'who', 'very', 'demanding', 'son', 'softens', 'when', 'appreciate', 'James', 'Jr.', 'superb', 'intellect', 'fine', 'character.Lowe', 'Booke', 'Farmer', 'are', 'core', 'champion', 'debating', 'team', 'history', 'challenging', 'students', 'who', 'attend', 'white', 'colleges', 'final', 'debate', 'place', 'Harvard', 'University', 'absolutely', 'electrifying', 'contestants', 'argue', 'back', 'forth', 'pros', 'cons', 'civil', 'disobedience', 'pair', 'Wiley', 'College', 'rise', 'occasion', 'What', 'most', 'impressive', 'fact', 'words', 'ideas', 'come', 'not', 'coach', 'own', 'minds', 'hearts', 'Great', 'Debaters', 'not', 'just', 'winning', 'verbal', 'contests', 'realistically', 'discrimination', 'oppression', 'minorities', 'workers', 'suffered', 'daily', 'hands', 'racists', 'tyrants', 'who', 'subjugated', 'was', 'rule', 'law', 'time', 'John', 'Heard', 'thankless', 'role', 'Sheriff', 'Dozier', 'redneck', 'sheriff', 'who', 'determined', 'see', 'Tolson', 'bars', 'preferably', 'dead', 'daring', 'challenge', 'establishment', 'What', 'movie', 'particular', 'memorable', 'are', 'quiet', 'scenes', 'actors', 'expressions', 'speak', 'volumes', 'James', 'Farmer', 'Jr.', 'appalled', 'when', 'father', 'forced', 'demean', 'pair', 'smirking', 'low-class', 'whites', 'accidentally', 'over', 'pig', 'James', 'Jr.', 'how', 'man', 'whom', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'possibly', 'behave', 'such', 'servile', 'manner', 'Viewers', 'will', 'be', 'revolted', 'scene', 'debaters', 'happen', 'mob', 'have', 'strung', 'up', 'black', 'man', 'set', 'fire', 'was', 'reality', 'Deep', 'South', 'Men', 'Tolson', 'Farmer', 'were', 'just', 'few', 'pioneers', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'so', 'much', 'children', 'would', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'forced', 'bow', 'heads', 'shame.Although', 'Great', 'Debaters', 'little', 'new', 'ground', 'cinematically', 'poignant', 'film', 'fine', 'performances', 'capable', 'direction', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'universal', 'significance', 'High', 'school', 'teachers', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'assign', 'movie', 'students', 'should', 'provoke', 'lively', 'class', 'discussion']",N/A

Pauzer,"[1, 1]","With great anticipation I sat down to watch two favorite actors, Denzel Washington and Forrest Whitaker perform in a movie whose title intrigued me no end. The Great Debaters is a fictionalized real account of a debating team from a small black college in rural Texas rise to challenge the Debating Team from Harvard.First they must be selected, which means candidates have to get past a professor with a hyper mercurial mind and spirit, and who spits out questions and challenges like the snap of a rabid dog. That would be Denzel Washington who explains to his team how slave owners tried to break the mind while salvaging the body for work.  In one of the better lines of the show he tells them he is going to teach them how to take back their minds. ""Debate is a blood sport,"" he declared. (I loved it already).The movie develops around the four students he selects for the team, and their personal lives. James Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker and related to neither) is the youngest of the team, and the son of a strict father and preacher played by Forrest Whitaker. He appears to be an unlikely character for convincing oratory, but his facial expressions are like beacons that bring light from your screen. His acting career should go nowhere but up.Nate Parker plays one of the conflicted debaters who uses the debates to fight his demons while he continues dalliances at the local dive with ladies regardless of their marital status. He turns on enough charm to seduce another team member, Jurnee Smollett played by Samantha Booke.The moral of the movie is that those who strive for excellence will achieve excellence, but this message is almost contradicted by the rampant, violent racism that permeated the South. Dr. Whitaker accidentally runs over a farmer's pig, and gently negotiates his reparation while maintaining his family's safety. It is obvious that the white trash he is bargaining with is just itching to get physical. But the second incident is beyond the physical. As the team is riding down the road in the professor's car, they come upon a lynching in progress. When the crowd discovers that the occupants of the car are black, their bloodlust sends them toward the vehicle, which manages to shift gears and turn around just in time. Such morbid racism suggests that excellence achieved is not just the pursuit of excellence but random selection in a predatory environment.I enjoyed the film and the dialogue, but there was something missing. There was little build-up in who was selected or why. (Perhaps that comes from being forced to view The Bachelor too many times). Under the direction of Denzel Washington, the suspense, which is key to a good debate, was missing. There would be a few lines, or sometimes none at all. Suddenly, you found out they won or lost.My score is four stars for a movie worth watching once. If you don't agree with my review or my score, well, I'll be happy to debate you.",4,Open to Debate,1296691200,"02 3, 2011",2011,2930,"['great', 'anticipation', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'two', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'perform', 'movie', 'title', 'intrigued', 'end', 'Great', 'Debaters', 'fictionalized', 'real', 'account', 'debating', 'team', 'small', 'black', 'college', 'rural', 'Texas', 'rise', 'challenge', 'Debating', 'Team', 'Harvard.First', 'must', 'be', 'selected', 'candidates', 'have', 'get', 'professor', 'hyper', 'mercurial', 'mind', 'spirit', 'who', 'out', 'questions', 'challenges', 'snap', 'rabid', 'dog', 'would', 'be', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'team', 'how', 'slave', 'owners', 'tried', 'break', 'mind', 'salvaging', 'body', 'work', 'one', 'better', 'lines', 'show', 'going', 'teach', 'how', 'take', 'back', 'minds', 'Debate', 'blood', 'sport', 'declared', 'loved', 'already', '.The', 'movie', 'four', 'students', 'team', 'personal', 'lives', 'James', 'Farmer', 'Jr.', 'Denzel', 'Whitaker', 'related', 'youngest', 'team', 'son', 'strict', 'father', 'preacher', 'played', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'be', 'unlikely', 'character', 'convincing', 'oratory', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'beacons', 'bring', 'light', 'screen', 'acting', 'career', 'should', 'go', 'nowhere', 'up.Nate', 'Parker', 'one', 'conflicted', 'debaters', 'who', 'debates', 'fight', 'demons', 'dalliances', 'local', 'dive', 'ladies', 'regardless', 'marital', 'status', 'enough', 'charm', 'seduce', 'team', 'member', 'Jurnee', 'Smollett', 'played', 'Samantha', 'Booke.The', 'moral', 'movie', 'who', 'strive', 'excellence', 'will', 'achieve', 'excellence', 'message', 'almost', 'contradicted', 'rampant', 'violent', 'racism', 'permeated', 'South', 'Dr.', 'Whitaker', 'accidentally', 'farmer', 'pig', 'gently', 'reparation', 'maintaining', 'family', 'safety', 'obvious', 'white', 'trash', 'bargaining', 'just', 'itching', 'get', 'physical', 'second', 'incident', 'physical', 'team', 'riding', 'down', 'road', 'professor', 'car', 'come', 'lynching', 'progress', 'When', 'crowd', 'occupants', 'car', 'are', 'black', 'bloodlust', 'sends', 'vehicle', 'shift', 'gears', 'turn', 'around', 'just', 'time', 'Such', 'morbid', 'racism', 'excellence', 'achieved', 'not', 'just', 'pursuit', 'excellence', 'random', 'selection', 'predatory', 'environment.I', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'dialogue', 'was', 'something', 'missing', 'was', 'little', 'build-up', 'who', 'was', 'selected', 'why', 'Perhaps', 'being', 'forced', 'view', 'Bachelor', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'direction', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'suspense', 'key', 'good', 'debate', 'was', 'missing', 'would', 'be', 'few', 'lines', 'sometimes', 'none', 'Suddenly', 'found', 'won', 'lost.My', 'score', 'four', 'stars', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'review', 'score', 'well', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'debate']",N/A

Lisa and Pablo Moreno, Alessandra Prado, Nadya, Alex and I watch because we were engaged on a rather deep debate over the political contenders for this year's election... and we decided to share with them a movie that truly explains the meaning of a debate... A war of ideals, perceptions and opinions... where our weapons are... words!!!After seeing this movie for the first time, I researched the story only to realize that the story is based on a real life story that inspired a change of the way our Nation thinks and planted the seeds for the Civil Rights movement in the United States.Melvin B. Tolson, played by one of our favorite actors, Denzel Washington is a professor at a college in Texas that encourages young people to participate in the discovery of the fire within... as he tells one of his students during a training lesson: ""we are here to challenge your thinking process to make sure you regain your mind.""Professor Tolson creates a debate club that goes from school to school testing their wits with the best, but they debate and he writes their opinions, something that teaches these young people to think provocatively, but in essence, the messages are not truly theirs.While he is a professor during the day, he champions causes at night but organizing sharecroppers and laborers. He is seen as a communist by some, a radical by others and a danger to many by those in power because he is inspiring change.Among those he selects for the 1935 team we find James Farmer Jr. masterfully played by Denzel Whitaker, Henry, played by Nate Parker and Samantha, the first female to ever join the debate team, beautifully played by Jurnee Smollet.James is only 14 years old and already in college, the best researcher the team has ever had, eloquent, vivacious and always hopeful and happy. Many experiences chisel away at their beliefs until they find their own voice and what a voice it becomes. The debates are inspirational, the struggle to understand simply magnificent, and the real life lessons reveal the trauma experienced by African Americans that grew at a time when lynching a man in Texas was common place.There are moments of joy but plenty of moments where the viewer is left in shock at the atrocities inflicted by rural whites on African Americans whose only crime was to be different.One of my favorite moments comes when James Farmer Jr. realizes that there is no hope, they are debating in a world where they are nothing more than ""negroes"" in a world that does not accept or welcomes their ideals, and troubled Henry givens him strength again, crying out loud: ""don't give up James, not you!""They win wherever they debate and Harvard becomes aware of this team and invites them to debate on their campus, and this debate is the ultimate climax to an inspirational film, where they are no longer allowed to say the words prepared by their professor, but told they must prepare their arguments themselves. After a period of rigorous soul-searching they argue from the heart, and while the Harvard team was brilliant, they spoke from the conviction of those who had never lived the reality of the south... Simply magnificent to see a body of highly educated intellectuals rendered silent by truths that were abhorrent but the truth of the south none-the-less.",5,A truly inspirational film,1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,3385,"['truly', 'inspirational', 'film', 'now', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'last', 'night', 'Lisa', 'Pablo', 'Moreno', 'Alessandra', 'Prado', 'Nadya', 'Alex', 'watch', 'were', 'engaged', 'rather', 'deep', 'debate', 'political', 'contenders', 'year', 'election', 'decided', 'share', 'movie', 'truly', 'meaning', 'debate', 'A', 'war', 'ideals', 'perceptions', 'opinions', 'where', 'weapons', 'are', 'words', 'seeing', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'researched', 'story', 'only', 'realize', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'inspired', 'change', 'way', 'Nation', 'thinks', 'planted', 'seeds', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'United', 'States.Melvin', 'B.', 'Tolson', 'played', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'professor', 'college', 'Texas', 'young', 'people', 'participate', 'discovery', 'fire', 'one', 'students', 'training', 'lesson', 'are', 'here', 'challenge', 'thinking', 'process', 'make', 'sure', 'regain', 'mind', 'Professor', 'Tolson', 'debate', 'club', 'school', 'school', 'testing', 'wits', 'best', 'debate', 'opinions', 'something', 'young', 'people', 'think', 'provocatively', 'essence', 'messages', 'are', 'not', 'truly', 'professor', 'day', 'causes', 'night', 'organizing', 'sharecroppers', 'laborers', 'seen', 'communist', 'radical', 'others', 'danger', 'many', 'power', 'inspiring', 'change.Among', '1935', 'team', 'find', 'James', 'Farmer', 'Jr.', 'masterfully', 'played', 'Denzel', 'Whitaker', 'Henry', 'played', 'Nate', 'Parker', 'Samantha', 'first', 'female', 'ever', 'join', 'debate', 'team', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Jurnee', 'Smollet.James', 'only', '14', 'years', 'old', 'already', 'college', 'best', 'researcher', 'team', 'ever', 'had', 'eloquent', 'vivacious', 'always', 'hopeful', 'happy', 'Many', 'experiences', 'chisel', 'away', 'beliefs', 'find', 'own', 'voice', 'what', 'voice', 'debates', 'are', 'inspirational', 'struggle', 'understand', 'simply', 'magnificent', 'real', 'life', 'lessons', 'reveal', 'trauma', 'experienced', 'African', 'Americans', 'grew', 'time', 'when', 'lynching', 'man', 'Texas', 'was', 'common', 'place.There', 'are', 'moments', 'joy', 'plenty', 'moments', 'where', 'viewer', 'left', 'shock', 'atrocities', 'inflicted', 'rural', 'whites', 'African', 'Americans', 'only', 'crime', 'was', 'be', 'different.One', 'favorite', 'moments', 'when', 'James', 'Farmer', 'Jr.', 'hope', 'are', 'debating', 'world', 'where', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'negroes', 'world', 'not', 'accept', 'welcomes', 'ideals', 'troubled', 'Henry', 'givens', 'strength', 'again', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'James', 'not', 'win', 'wherever', 'debate', 'Harvard', 'aware', 'team', 'debate', 'campus', 'debate', 'ultimate', 'climax', 'inspirational', 'film', 'where', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'allowed', 'say', 'words', 'prepared', 'professor', 'told', 'must', 'prepare', 'arguments', 'period', 'rigorous', 'soul-searching', 'argue', 'heart', 'Harvard', 'team', 'was', 'brilliant', 'spoke', 'conviction', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'lived', 'reality', 'south', 'Simply', 'magnificent', 'see', 'body', 'highly', 'educated', 'intellectuals', 'rendered', 'silent', 'truths', 'were', 'abhorrent', 'truth', 'south', 'none-the-less']",N/A

(In the movie, the white team is Harvard, but in fact it was USC.) The plot of the movie revolves around the struggles of the debating team to achieve recognition during an era in which civil rights were a mere glimmer on their progenitors' eyes. (Not surprisingly, several of those progenitors were members of the debating team.) The outcome is predictable, so in that sense, this is a ""feel-good"" film. But the purpose of the film wasn't just to make us root for the underdog. The Great Debaters was clearly intended as a vehicle to portray the origins of the civil rights movement.The movie makes some departures from historical events, but these were not of a nature to detract from the story. Where the final debate took place is not particularly important. What is important is that the film accurately depicted the hurdles faced by the black community in the 1930s. This was an era in which ""justice"" was often administered at the end of a rope, and in which being black was a crime in and of itself. The horrifying scene in which James Farmer, Jr. (who eventually became one of the ""Big Four"" of the civil rights movement), witnesses a lynching encapsulated the purpose of this film, which was to explain the need for civil rights. The debates, themselves, while probably departing significantly from the originals, served to present the arguments used by later civil rights advocates, notably Martin Luther King, Jr.Unlike many films based on ""true stories"" the Great Debaters tackled the larger social issues of the times.

Having taught in an inner-city high school, I know that:1) Probably none of my students could sit through this film2) Certainly none of them would even understand what this kind of achievement requires3) The vocabulary would lose them completelyWhile the Wiley students were outside the norm of their era, they were nearly all poor kids from poor backgrounds who endured third rate schools and textbooks discarded by the white schools. And yet, despite these apparent obstacles, managed to be learn to read, speak, and think in an exemplary manner. Today, we beg young people to accept our proffered education, spending millions on facilities, books, and programs that accomplish next to nothing. The Wiley teachers had authority. And learners who knew what was at stake. Today's teachers have no authority, and today's students, bred on victimhood and endlessly recited oppression, feel the system is stacked against them and cannot be overcome. Teachers without authority supervising students without interest are babysitters or lion tamers, but they are not, and cannot be, educators.This is a breathtaking film. Oprah's money is well spent, as the look and feel is as genuine as I've ever seen in such a film. Clothing, cars, chairs, wallpaper, coffee cups all reek of the time. And with scenery I would never identify as Texas, I was amazed. Utterly gorgeous. But more than looks, this film has brains. Henry Lowe exemplifies a choice that fewer and fewer young black men make. He is tempted by the music, the smoke, the carnality. But he refuses, putting aside what he wants to do for what he must do. How many young men follow that lead today? Not one of the students I taught could have read Thoreau, let alone argued its ideas. Quoted poetry? Not happening any more.The film is not perfect. It allows the racial animosity of the time to create the obligatory hate whitey scenes. The debates all feel small and trite, with small arguments and way too much passion rather than reason. Civil disobedience is a fine topic to debate; neither side does much justice to their positions. But the idea that circumstances do not control us, opponents do not control us, only our ambitions and willingness to work control us, is not only beautiful to watch but inspiring to share.

Coming from little-known Wiley College, they go on to compete with the best debating clubs in the land. The film gives a heart-stopping portrayal of the violence and intimidation faced by American Americans during the period. A lynching scene is especially harrowing. It was an era when lynching was commonplace and a pig-farming white man could get away with intimidating a black PhD. Great performances from Denzel Washington and Forrest Whittaker as the debate coach and college chaplain. Wonderful supporting roles from the rest of the cast. The writing is first rate, making it seem cool and exciting to pull quotes from Thoreau, Hughes and Gandhi out of your head. There were a number of interesting subplots that wove their way through the narrative. Denzel's character organized laborers on the side; a lakeside shack serves as blues/gospel hangout. A requisite love story between two of the debaters took the steam off the film's intellectual bent.(Spoilers)Some concerns. Trying to communicate to a 21st century audience the razor's edge walked by 1930s blacks was mishandled. Given the dangerous times they lived in, the black debaters were almost militant in their arguments. Even a northern university audience might have been alarmed at the veiled threats being made. Then too, the movie erred in following the standard ""Remember The Titans"" cinematic model in which Denzel leads an unlikely team to beat the best in the league. Sticking closer to history, in which Wiley was less than completely victorious in the literal sense would have been more accurate. Perhaps the movie makers didn't think we could handle the truth that progress for blacks in the 1930s was gained a tiny step at a time. And that audiences can appreciate the import of symbolic victory.Still, I found ""The Great Debaters"" to be riveting and watchable. The DVD extras, in which Denzel interviews elderly Wiley College grads gave texture into a difficult era.

They became the Davids who slew the white Goliaths in the art of debate.  Against all odds, the team mows down opponent after opponent before its climactic contest - taking on the Harvard debate team in Cambridge.Need I tell you how it ends?  Without seeing the movie, you probably can guess.  The cast is strong and the story is feel-good, but the characters are somewhat two-dimensional.  White folks in particular do not come off very well, being stereotyped as either sadistic redneck crackers or smug intellectuals.  Such is the portrayal in OprahLand perhaps.The movie hearkens back to a bygone day when college debate involved reasoning and oratory; this, in stark contrast to modern college debate, which features how fast you can spit out information at 400-words per minute, incomprehensible except to the cognoscenti.In ""The Great Debaters"", each black student becomes Demosthenes when he or she gets up behind the podium.

Inspired by a true story, it contains some events of how African-Americans lived during the 1930s amidst the atmosphere of random lynchings.Melvin B. Tolson (portrayed by Denzel Washington) was an educated professor at Wiley College (in the rural south) by day and a human rights radical by night.  Not even his wife (portrayed by Kimberly Elise) knew of his activism.  The quartet of intelligent debaters each had their own baggage to carry.  Henry Lowe (portrayed by Nate Parker) liked juke joints, ""holy wine"" and the ladies.  Samantha Booke (portrayed by Jurnee Smollett) wanted to be a lawyer and knew it was an uphill climb.  James Farmer, Jr. (portrayed by Denzel Whitaker) seemed to seek the approval of his father (a Ph.D. scholar and minister who spoke seven languages; portrayed by Forest Whitaker); Junior had witnessed his father being degraded by a White man because James, Sr. had accidentally killed the man's pig with his car; Junior also witnessed the strength of his father standing up to the sheriff and convincing him to release Professor Tolson from jail after being arrested for holding a meeting to organize sharecroppers (both Black and White) ""to make things right"" against the farm bosses, after which Junior told the man ""that pig wasn't worth $25, you owe my father some money.""  The team became a trio when Hamilton Burgess (portrayed by Jermaine Williams) withdrew because his father disapproved of Professor Tolson's rumored ""communist"" political beliefs - he was at Wiley College ""to be educated, not investigated.""Although this debate team had a record of 10-1, their crowning glory came when they won against the Harvard debate team on the subject of civil disobedience.  It did not escape my attention the character named Wilson (portrayed by Damien Leake) who appeared briefly near the end of the movie.  He was the butler/attendant for the three Wiley College students as they were preparing for their Harvard debate.  Despite his position, his high intelligence showed when he inserted himself into their conversation nonchalantly by saying ""Satyagraha from the Sanskrit meaning truth and fairness.""The Wiley College debaters' mantra:  Who's the judge?  The judge is God.  Why is he God?  Because he decides who wins or loses, not my opponent.  Who is your opponent?  He doesn't exist.  Why doesn't he exist?

The owner of one of those shops told me that several pieces of furniture out of her store had been purchased to use in the movie.  That was fascinating.  When you watch the movie, you'll have so much to see -- all the rich historical drama and good acting of a suspense-filled plot -- that you may not notice the authenticty of the set, including the furniture.  If you buy the DVD, you will have enough interesting things to watch again and again.It is sad to realize how things were in the 1930's in the part of the world where I live.  This movie portrays the horrible way black people were treated.  This story of Melvin B. Tolson, played by Denzel Washington, gives background information about the Civil Rights movement.  Tolson's 1935 debate club at Wiley College, Marshall, Texas, stunned the nation.  (I won't give the end of the plot away!)Langston Hughes, the famous poet who authored ""A Dream Deferred"", visited Wiley College and said,  ""Melvin Tolson is the most famous Negro professor in the Southwest. Students all over that part of the world speak of him, revere him, remember him and love him.""  Tolson was active on many levels.  In real life he was an English and speech professor, labor organizer, modern poet, novelist, debate coach, drama coach, and football coach! His methods were radical.  At times while I watched the movie, I was anxious about some of his behavior as played by Denzel Washington.  It is amazing that this man was not lynched.Instead, the professor did just fine and eventually left Wiley College to teach in Oklahoma.  Wiley College, located in east Texas between Dallas and Shreveport, is doing fine too.  In fact, it continues to thrive and has one of th best teacher-student ratios in the nation.I digress.  Back to the movie,  I admired the writers and producers, along with Denzel Washington (the director) for having the courage to tell the truth.  The movie protrays painfully true pictures of both blacks and whites of the time. It shows the oppression of intelligent black people by uneducated white people. It also shows the conflicts within a young black man who struggled with issues related to moving into adulthood.  The pain he caused a young woman is played with sensitivity.To modern educators, the students may have seemed wooden in their debates. The professor rehearsed the students and taught them by rote.In our time, we are so eager to make all our students independent thinkers that we do not achieve the discipline that made these debaters successful.THE GREAT DEBATERS is much more than a movie about social causes.

The semester has just begun and it's time for tryouts for the debate team with Melvin B. Tolson (Denzel Washington) as the coach.Out of 45 students, only 4 make the cut.  That's two team members and two alternates.  Hamilton Burgess (Jermaine Williams) is the only returning student.Henry Lowe (Nate Parker) is obviously the pick of the crop.  He's so much of the same mind as Tolson, they could easily be enemies if they weren't aligned, but both men have their own demons chasing them. Samantha Booke, alternate, (Jumee Smollett), wants to be the third Negro woman to practice law in the State of Texas.  She's ambitious and she nearly lets romance with Lowe get in her way.  James Farmer, Jr., alternate, (Denzel Whitaker), is only 14 years old and being strongly pushed by his father Dr. James Farmer, Sr (Forest Whitaker, who is not related to him) to excel in his studies and not let the debate team get in his way.Tolson's got an ambitious program started.  From the beginning, he's writing top schools, challenging them to match wits with his students.As the team wins, more invitations come in.  Meanwhile, Tolson is privately leading an effort to form a union for the Black and White sharecroppers of the area.  Unfortunately, the local farmers disapprove and the meeting's attacked with the local Sheriff in the lead.  Tolson himself nearly goes to jail and loses one member of his team because he's got a dangerous reputation as a Communist.""The Great Debaters"" may not be completely accurate about the histories of the people it depicts, but it is an education to the times themselves.  We learn some poignant lessons about the origin of the term lynching and see an example.  We also learn about civil disobedience and what it really means--and costs--to stand up for what you believe in.Some describe this as a 'feel good' or 'team' film and I don't dispute either of these findings, but ""The Great Debaters"" is also an opportunity to demonstrate the history of a time and of a people.

1135043,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00125WAWS,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","***1/2In ""The Great Debaters,"" a true story that takes place in the 1930s, Denzel Washington plays Melvin B. Tolson, a professor at Wiley College, an all-black school in Marshall, Texas.  The movie chronicles his efforts to get his debating team to compete against some of the most prestigious Anglo colleges - including Harvard - in the country.  This was no mean accomplishment, given the intense prejudice and opposition thrown up against the very idea of a ""white"" school hosting a black debating squad, particularly in the Jim Crow South.  Tolson was also a furtive union organizer of local sharecroppers, an activity that ultimately got him accused of being a communist in the politically volatile world of the Great Depression.""The Great Debaters"" is a solid, old-fashioned social drama that wears its emotionalism and its ""squareness"" proudly on its sleeve.  As director, Washington doesn't indulge in narrative complexities or fancy cinematic flourishes, preferring to let the drama and the temper of the times speak for themselves.  It's true that the characters could use a little more development, but the acting is solid, with Denzel Whitaker winning top honors as James Farmer, Jr., the 16-year-old member of the trio who's torn between his impressive intellect, his innate self-consciousness and his burgeoning puberty.  The first-rate cast is rounded out by Nate Parker and Jurnee Smollet as Henry Lowe and Samantha Booke, the other two members of the team who become romantically involved with one another; Forest Whitaker as James' loving but overbearing father; and John Heard as a bigoted sheriff who has it in for Tolson.The movie ends with a where-they-all-ended-up title-card wrap-up that adds to the movie's inspirational effect.  It's easier to reject the film intellectually than emotionally, since the filmmakers know all the right buttons to push.

1135044,A2E7E9EWADK4S6,B00125WAWS,"Rosemary Thornton ""Niece of Murder Victim, Ad...","[1, 1]","The Great Debaters was inspired by the true story of the debate team at Wiley College, an African-American college that was originally created in 1873 by the ""Freedman's Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church."" Their goal was to help educate and prepare newly-freed slaves as they made the difficult transition into a new life.Now, with that as a historical backdrop, you know ""The Great Debaters"" has got to be rich in history, import, meaning and cultural significance. And it is.Professor Tolson (played by Denzel Washington) started coaching his now-famous debate team in 1929 and the movie is set in the year 1935, when 40 college kids would show up to audition for the four coveted spots on his team. If this movie were just another ""academic cinderella story"" it'd be interesting and entertaining but The Great Debaters is so much more than that.Born and raised in southeastern Virginia, I know a little bit about what racism looked like in the 1960s. This movie gave me a keyhole peak at racism in the 1930s and it was something I'll not soon forget. The scene depicting Forest Whitaker's confrontation (over a lost pig) with two no-account white racists was very believable and powerful and it was equally memorable and disturbing.Another scene that showed a lynching was probably the most haunting scene and yet witnessing that horrible event proved to be a catalyst for one of the debaters.If you go online and do a little background reading, you'll learn that some artistic license was exercised in telling the story of The Great Debaters (for instance, in 1935, they won a debate against University of Southern California; they never debated Harvard). However, for the most part, the story is good and true and very worthwhile.I don't buy a lot of DVDs but this is one movie I'd like to own. Powerful story and very well-told. And speaking as a history snob, the background details (the depiction of the 1930s time period) were also very well done and accurate.And an important PS to this movie review:  According to an article in the New York Times (published Dec. 5, 2007), Wiley College has been struggling for years to keep their doors open, and in recent years, that struggle has become even more severe. The article also states that Wiley has not had the financial wherewithal to sponsor a debate team for many years. Hopefully ""The Great Debaters"" will effect a sea-change in this historic college's financial fortunes.",5,Words - both spoken and written - can wield great power,1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,2446,"['Great', 'Debaters', 'was', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'debate', 'team', 'Wiley', 'College', 'African-American', 'college', 'was', 'originally', 'created', '1873', 'Freedman', 'Aid', 'Society', 'Methodist', 'Episcopal', 'Church', 'goal', 'was', 'help', 'educate', 'prepare', 'newly-freed', 'slaves', 'made', 'difficult', 'transition', 'new', 'life.Now', 'historical', 'backdrop', 'know', 'Great', 'Debaters', 'got', 'be', 'rich', 'history', 'import', 'meaning', 'cultural', 'significance', 'Tolson', 'played', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'started', 'coaching', 'now-famous', 'debate', 'team', '1929', 'movie', 'set', 'year', '1935', 'when', '40', 'college', 'kids', 'would', 'show', 'up', 'audition', 'four', 'coveted', 'spots', 'team', 'movie', 'were', 'just', 'academic', 'cinderella', 'story', ""'d"", 'be', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'Great', 'Debaters', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'that.Born', 'raised', 'southeastern', 'Virginia', 'know', 'little', 'bit', 'what', 'racism', 'looked', '1960s', 'movie', 'gave', 'keyhole', 'peak', 'racism', '1930s', 'was', 'something', ""'ll"", 'not', 'soon', 'forget', 'scene', 'depicting', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'confrontation', 'lost', 'pig', 'two', 'no-account', 'white', 'racists', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'powerful', 'was', 'equally', 'memorable', 'disturbing.Another', 'scene', 'showed', 'lynching', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'haunting', 'scene', 'yet', 'witnessing', 'horrible', 'event', 'proved', 'be', 'catalyst', 'one', 'debaters.If', 'go', 'online', 'do', 'little', 'background', 'reading', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'artistic', 'license', 'was', 'exercised', 'telling', 'story', 'Great', 'Debaters', 'instance', '1935', 'won', 'debate', 'University', 'Southern', 'California', 'never', 'debated', 'Harvard', 'However', 'most', 'part', 'story', 'good', 'true', 'very', 'worthwhile.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'lot', 'DVDs', 'one', 'movie', ""'d"", 'like', 'own', 'Powerful', 'story', 'very', 'well-told', 'speaking', 'history', 'snob', 'background', 'details', 'depiction', '1930s', 'time', 'period', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'accurate.And', 'important', 'PS', 'movie', 'review', 'According', 'article', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'published', 'Dec.', '5', '2007', 'Wiley', 'College', 'been', 'struggling', 'years', 'keep', 'doors', 'open', 'recent', 'years', 'struggle', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'severe', 'article', 'also', 'Wiley', 'not', 'had', 'financial', 'wherewithal', 'sponsor', 'debate', 'team', 'many', 'years', 'Hopefully', 'Great', 'Debaters', 'will', 'effect', 'sea-change', 'historic', 'college', 'financial', 'fortunes']",N/A

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[10, 10]","Initially when I saw the preview for this movie, it just looked like another team movie where at the end, we all scream and root for the underdogs.  However, I saw a movie clip of Denzel Washington's character, Professor Tolson, educating his students on the connection between Willie Lynch and lynching and grabbed my ticket to see the movie in full. ""The Great Debaters"" is based on the true story of Melvin B. Tolson (played by Washington), a professor at Wiley College in Texas. In 1935, he inspired students to form the school's first debate team and helped bring more firsts: the first black female debater Samantha Booke (played by Jurnee Smollett) and the leader of the first Black college to win a national championship.  He also brought along two other team members: a stubborn but very intelligent and charismatic debater Henry Lowe (played by Nate Parker) and James Farmer Jr. (played by Denzel Whitaker). Forest Whitaker plays James Farmer, the college president, the first black man to earn a PhD from Texas, and a man who stood up for a legal case for Washington's character.The movie immediately grabbed me when I heard the opening lines of my favorite poet's, Langston Hughes, creation ""I, Too, Sing America."" Not only did this movie give the audience English lessons through poetry and quotes of prominent African Americans, but it also gave some very important African American history lessons about topics like civil disobedience, the connection between Willie Lynch and lynching in the south, capitalism versus Methodist practices, the contradictions of W.E.B. DuBois, hinted at the story of Emmitt Till along with other young, black boys who were tortured before being lynched, a disturbing scene where the students came face to face with a lynch mob and a young, black man burned and hung from a tree, and how a sheriff in the town they lived in was the ringleader against a peaceful protest.The tale is real. Some characters are fictional but ideas from their personalities are based on characters that Tolson actually knew.  Other characters center around characters that went on to become outstanding leaders in today's society, such as James Farmer Jr., who in real life is the founder of Congress of Race Equality (1942) and an essential protestor for the Civil Rights Movement.Movies like these, especially for African Americans, don't come around often, but they are surely appreciated, much like another incredible movie (Something the Lord Made), which was aired on HBO. The education within ""The Great Debaters"" is what is shunned in American history books, rarely heard about even during Black History Month, and I probably would've never heard of before Christmas of 2007, when the movie released. In addition to the historical lessons and political and social arguments debated within this movie, the audience watches a tale of a young man and a young woman, and how racism can break a young man's spirit not just through education but in his relationship with her. We witness a young man whose father deals with a belittling and repulsive situation with a car accident and learns what it's like to deal with racism in the 1930s. The audience is introduced to Tolson, who refuses to back down on the lessons he teaches, where he takes on debates, and his views on race and religion because of the color of his skin.I'm sure audience members came away with different lessons learned and various favorite scenes.  There was a scene where one young man kissed the inside of a young woman's hand, and it was the most romantic and innocent scene that I've seen in films for quite some time. But, the most powerful scene for me was not that of seeing the firsthand lynching, how a black man was treated for trying to have an intelligent negotiation with two men too uneducated to know what endorse meant, or the end result of the debate at Harvard.  The most powerful scene for me was during a debate on integration for schools when several white southerners left a debate without listening to the pros of letting black people and white people enter school together. Instead of taking the time to listen to both sides of an argument, people who were so set in their ways and continuous practice of racism wouldn't even give the students the chance to speak up, even if it was for an academic cause. This is the type of film that needs to be shown to not only an African American audience, but an American audience, so they can see what is missing in American history and English books (Tolson was also a poet). I'm sure there will be irate ratings from conservatives and people who think racism is in the past or people should just get over it, but I loved every single minute of it, will not get over America's ugly past, but will use lessons and films like these to improve as a person. Great job to all the cast, crew, writers, and Professor Tolson!",5,African American History on Film,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,4882,"['Initially', 'when', 'saw', 'preview', 'movie', 'just',

I was hesitant to see this film, because who wants to watch a film about a debate team? Denzel Washington, however, happens to be one of my favorite actors, so I gave it a shot and learned quite a bit. The debate team was just an instrument, and was comprised of four people who would all go on to play significant roles in the Civil Rights Movement. The films follows award winning author, Melvin Tolson (Washington), on his journey to create the best African-American College debate team in the country, a team that would eventually go on to challenge the debate team at Harvard University.

1135055,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00125WAWS,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Nominated for Golden Globe and starring two Oscar winners, ""The Great Debaters"" should have been more widely known, but somehow I missed the film when it was released about five years ago. Now I've seen the film, and I'm still trying to like the film. Acting is top-notch. The photography (Philippe Rousselot, ""A River Runs Through it"") is wonderful. The film also deals with a real-life story that is intriguing: all Afro-American debate team in the American South during the 1930s. But something is not quite right, something about the way it is told.Denzel Washington plays Melvin B. Tolson, an English and speech teacher at Wiley College, later known also as a poet and politician. He forms a debate team, with the team members Henry Lowe (Nate Parker), Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett), Hamilton Burgess (Jermaine Williams) and a 14-year-old James L. Farmer, Jr. (Denzel Whitaker), who went on to become a civil rights activist.This is Denzel Washington's second effort as a director. His storytelling is slick and confident. Sure, some of the subplots are conventional and not very interesting to me (Henry and Samantha's love affair, for instance), but with fleshed-out characters they are not that bad. The father-son conflict between Dr. James Farmer Sr. (Forest Whitaker) and James looks pretty familiar, but it is convincing.But somehow it seems ""The Great Debaters"" is not really interested in the topic about which it is supposed to tell: debates. The debate scenes are heated and uplifting, thanks to the great performances of the young cast, but the speeches themselves are sometimes too polished (some of them written by Washington's Tolson, an aspect that is not fully explored in the film). How did the students learn the skills?Of course, the film is not just about debating; it is also about the history, or a greater narrative context within which the story is told. Still, I think these likable and credible characters played by talented young players (Denzel Whitaker is just amazing), ""The Great Debaters"" could have been much better with more emphasis on the debates.",3,We Need More Debates,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,2092,"['Nominated', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'starring', 'two', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Great', 'Debaters', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'widely', 'known', 'somehow', 'missed', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'like', 'film', 'Acting', 'top-notch', 'photography', 'Philippe', 'Rousselot', 'River', 'Runs', 'wonderful', 'film', 'also', 'real-life', 'story', 'intriguing', 'Afro-American', 'debate', 'team', 'American', 'South', '1930s', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'something', 'way', 'told.Denzel', 'Washington', 'Melvin', 'B.', 'Tolson', 'English', 'speech', 'teacher', 'Wiley', 'College', 'later', 'known', 'also', 'poet', 'politician', 'debate', 'team', 'team', 'members', 'Henry', 'Lowe', 'Nate', 'Parker', 'Samantha', 'Booke', 'Jurnee', 'Smollett', 'Hamilton', 'Burgess', 'Jermaine', 'Williams', '14-year-old', 'James', 'L.', 'Farmer', 'Jr.', 'Denzel', 'Whitaker', 'who', 'went', 'become', 'civil', 'rights', 'activist.This', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'second', 'effort', 'director', 'storytelling', 'slick', 'confident', 'Sure', 'subplots', 'are', 'conventional', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'Henry', 'Samantha', 'love', 'affair', 'instance', 'fleshed-out', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'father-son', 'conflict', 'Dr.', 'James', 'Farmer', 'Sr.', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'James', 'pretty', 'familiar', 'convincing.But', 'somehow', 'Great', 'Debaters', 'not', 'really', 'interested', 'topic', 'supposed', 'tell', 'debates', 'debate', 'scenes', 'are', 'heated', 'uplifting', 'thanks', 'great', 'performances', 'young', 'cast', 'speeches', 'are', 'sometimes', 'too', 'polished', 'written', 'Washington', 'Tolson', 'aspect', 'not', 'fully', 'explored', 'film', 'How', 'did', 'students', 'learn', 'skills', 'course', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'debating', 'also', 'history', 'greater', 'narrative', 'context', 'story', 'told', 'Still', 'think', 'likable', 'credible', 'characters', 'played', 'talented', 'young', 'players', 'Denzel', 'Whitaker', 'just', 'amazing', 'Great', 'Debaters', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'emphasis', 'debates']",N/A
1135056,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00125WAWS,Turfseer,"[0, 3]","'The Great Debaters is inspired by the true-life exploits of the all-black Wiley College debating team in Marshall, Texas in the 1930s. The script follows only the bare outline of the events that actually occurred. The debates themselves and the ideas behind them are a very small part of the picture. Instead we're treated to a series of snippets (or sound bites) with the Wiley team always taking the morally superior position and of course winning. At no time are they asked to show their real skills as debaters and take a position which they ethically and morally oppose. While the true Wiley College debaters of history were certainly admirable for what they achieved, there was no need to put them all on a pedestal by having them best the Harvard Debate team in the film's climax. In reality, Wiley beat USC; by depicting them as beating Harvard, the implication is that somehow they were superstars for beating the best (and hey maybe they were just excellent students who don't need to be mythologized).The main character, Melvin B. Tolson (played by Denzel Washington) is based on the real Wiley College professor who also was a union organizer. In a scene that felt like it was more likely to take place in the 1960s than the 1930s, Tolson heads a secret meeting of black sharecroppers as well as whites intent on organizing against racist farmers. The meeting is broken up by a group of angry whites and Tolson escapes with his life (along with James Farmer Jr., the 14 year old member of his debating team, later to become a famous civil rights leader). The probability of this scene actually having happened in 1930s Texas is low especially the idea that there were progressive whites who would even consider attending a meeting together with poor black sharecroppers. Later, Tolson is arrested for organizing the union meeting. In reality,wouldn't he have been taken away in the middle of the night and dumped in a shallow grave? Or perhaps lynched? Here, the black community wields a lot more power than it actually had in those days, when a group led by James Farmer Sr., the dignified Wiley professor played by Forrest Whittaker, convinces the town's sheriff to release Tolson on bond. We never really find out the outcome of Tolson's arrest (which presumably is a fictional scene) but according to the end credits, he went on to live a distinguished life as an academic and poet.The rest of the movie is taken up with a subplot concerning the romance between the team's only female member, Samantha Booke and the bad-boy character, Henry Lowe (who incurs Samantha's wrath by getting drunk and hanging out with another woman after witnessing a lynching). The aforementioned 14 year old has a crush on Samantha and must overcome his feelings of jealousy before he can best Harvard in the final showdown.The film is not without its powerful moments. The most memorable is when James Farmer Sr. accidentally kills a boar while driving in his car with his family. He's forced to pay compensation to two racist whites by handing over his paycheck and is further humiliated when one of the racists drops the check and makes Farmer bend over and pick it up (it's scenes like this that are far more effective than the typical mob scenes of racist whites on the loose since they show the day-to-day humiliations which blacks had to endure across the country on a daily basis). There is also an actual lynching scene which Tolson and his debaters stumble upon while driving on a darkened road.Despite this, The Great Debaters is a well-intentioned but formulaic project.

Ok, so you're a trillionaire, Oprah, no doubt as executive producer Denzel bamboozled a lot of dough out of you, BUT HAVEN'T WE HEARD ENOUGH ALREADY FROM YOU?  Just keep giving away automobiles and shut up, k?As for the movie, all the new young actors were superb.  I hesitated watching this movie because I thought: how can anyone make a movie about *debating* interesting?Finally, I realized -- hey, wait a second, Denzel, Denzel Washington.  God!  Everything he does is good and right, pure and omniscent.Denzel Washington, upon whom the Celluloid World rises and sets.  Denzel Washington, who can leap buildings in a single bound.  (And I mean that.  With an unbelievable amount of sincerity.)And he didn't fail.  As both actor and director, he did an excellent job.  He's worth all the million of dollars he gets.  More so than ... even me.I can't say that his acting in this movie was as good as the movie overall, which was excellent, but I'm giving the movie five stars and if the estate of Carl Sagan doesn't like it they can kiss me in the Astor Bar.One other thing that I found rather amusing.  Towards the end of the movie the Wiley College students go to Boston to debate the Harvard team.  There they are told that the topic for debate is ""Resolved: Capitalism is Immoral.""  Then, at the last minute, they're told that due to a technicality (their teacher wasn't supposed to help them with their research) that the debate topic will be changed to ""Resolved: Civil Disobedience Can Be a Moral Weapon in the Fight For Justice.""lolIn the words of that great American philosopher Dana ""The Church Lady"" Carvey: ""How conveeeeeenient!"" ... I mean, wouldn't you love to see a movie that Oprah Winfrey produced wherein there's a debate about the morality of capitalism. ... Oprah the Filthy Rich Billionaire.And then of course guess what?  Guess who takes the affirmative of the *new* debate topic, ""Resolved: Civil Disobedience Can Be a Moral Weapon in the Fight For Justice.""I wonder why they even suggested debating the morality of capitalism.  Perhaps Oprah decided to become a socialist, and Denzel talked her out of it at the last minute.  To paraphrase Willie Loman's next door neightbor, Charlie: ""Are you a socialist, Oprah; or still working?"")But why indicate that Wiley was originally going to debate the morality of capitalism?  It seems to me that the filmmakers want it both ways.  They realize that during the Depression there were indeed a great many people who considered capitalism to be not just immoral but brutal, destructive and anathema to the human condition.  So they pay lipservice to that historical sentiment but, political cowards that they are, they quickly retreat to a premise -- civil disobedience in the face of unjust laws is permissible -- that's impossible to disagree with, let alone lose to in a debate.In short, Oprah is going to KEEP THE BILLIONS!!!She may wave to a socialist or two from her limousine.  But don't count on it.After all, truth, morality and justice may be sacred ... but profit is divine.Right, Oprah?",5,Count 'Em -- Five Stars!!!!!,1263600000,"01 16, 2010",2010,3205,"['Great', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'do', 'take', 'out', 'things', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'say', 'DVD', 'extras', 'What', 'ti', 'gal', 'Ok', ""'re"", 'trillionaire', 'Oprah', 'doubt', 'executive', 'producer', 'Denzel', 'bamboozled', 'lot', 'dough', 'BUT', 'HAVE', ""N'T"", 'WE', 'HEARD', 'ENOUGH', 'ALREADY', 'FROM', 'YOU', 'Just', 'keep', 'giving', 'away', 'automobiles', 'shut', 'up', 'k', 'movie', 'new', 'young', 'actors', 'were', 'superb', 'hesitated', 'watching', 'movie', 'thought', 'how', 'can', 'anyone', 'make', 'movie', '*debating*', 'interesting', 'Finally', 'realized', 'hey', 'wait', 'second', 'Denzel', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'God', 'Everything', 'good', 'right', 'pure', 'omniscent.Denzel', 'Washington', 'whom', 'Celluloid', 'World', 'sets', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'can', 'leap', 'buildings', 'single', 'bound', 'mean', 'unbelievable', 'amount', 'sincerity', 'did', ""n't"", 'fail', 'actor', 'director', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'million', 'dollars', 'More', 'so', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'overall', 'was', 'excellent', ""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'estate', 'Carl', 'Sagan', ""n't"", 'like', 'can', 'kiss', 'Astor', 'Bar.One', 'other', 'thing', 'found', 'rather', 'amusing', 'end', 'movie', 'Wiley', 'College', 'students', 'go', 'Boston', 'debate', 'Harvard', 'team', 'are', 'told', 'topic', 'debate', 'Resolved', 'Capitalism', 'Immoral', 'Then', 'last', 'minute', ""'re"", 'told', 'due', 'technicality', 'teacher', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'help', 'research', 'debate', 'topic', 'will', 'be', 'changed', 'Resolved', 'Civil', 'Disobedience', 'Can', 'Be', 'Moral', 'Weapon', 'Fight', 'Justice', 'words', 'great', 'American', 'philosopher', 'Dana', 'Church', 'Lady', 'Carvey', 'How', 'conveeeeeenient', 'mean', 'would', ""n't"", 'love', 'see', 'movie', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'produced', 'debate', 'morality', 'capitalism', 'Filthy', 'Rich', 'Billionaire.And', 'then', 'course', 'guess', 'what', 'Guess', 'who', 'affirmative', '*new*', 'debate', 'topic', 'Resolved', 'Civil', 'Disobedience', 'Can', 'Be', 'Moral', 'Weapon', 'Fight', 'Justice', 'wonder', 'why', 'even', 'suggested', 'debating', 'morality', 'capitalism', 'Perhaps', 'Oprah', 'decided', 'become', 'socialist', 'Denzel', 'talked', 'last', 'minute', 'paraphrase', 'Willie', 'Loman', 'next', 'door', 'neightbor', 'Charlie', 'Are', 'socialist', 'Oprah', 'still', 'working', 'why', 'indicate', 'Wiley', 'was', 'originally', 'going', 'debate', 'morality', 'capitalism', 'filmmakers', 'want', 'ways', 'realize', 'Depression', 'were', 'indeed', 'great', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'considered', 'capitalism', 'be', 'not', 'just', 'immoral', 'brutal', 'destructive', 'anathema', 'human', 'condition', 'pay', 'lipservice', 'historical', 'sentiment', 'political', 'cowards', 'are', 'quickly', 'retreat', 'premise', 'civil', 'disobedience', 'face', 'unjust', 'laws', 'permissible', 'impossible', 'disagree', 'let', 'alone', 'lose', 'debate.In', 'short', 'Oprah', 'going', 'KEEP', 'THE', 'BILLIONS', 'may', 'wave', 'socialist', 'two', 'limousine', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'it.After', 'truth', 'morality', 'justice', 'may', 'be', 'sacred', 'profit', 'divine.Right', 'Oprah']",N/A

Yet, my one beef with him has often been his very sympathetic, almost revisionist-history take on certain race issues, such as Malcolm X or the story of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter.  In those types of films, one race can do no wrong while the other is the root of all evil, which (in reality) is usually never the case.  When viewing this film, then, I had myself steeled for that sort of thing once again...the ""take with a grain of salt"" mentality.  Fortunately, this movie had zero problems in that area.The film tells the story of the small Wily College debate team in 1930s Texas (deep in the Jim Crow South) under the tutelage of the famous Melvin Tolson that took on all-comers (big or small) and defeated nearly every one of them.  Yet, despite the amazing feats accomplished by that debate team, the real message of this film centers on the actual issues that are being debated, mainly having to do with civil rights or civil disobedience.  This is where the debate format comes in very handy, as it allows for both sides of those important issues to be aired in the film.  Does some bias show?  Yes.  Yet, everyone has their own opinion, and the bias that is evident in the film does not go beyond that.The acting in this movie is also terrific.  Washington is at his cool-as-a-cucumber best, while the young acting talent (forming the debate team) is also very strong.  The presence of Forest Whitaker is another plus.Overall, this is a great film that will really get you thinking about the issues that plagued the Jim Crow South.  Most importantly, though, you will be able to see both sides of the story before making your decision.  While in the film the judges decide who wins each debate, you can decide for yourself what you believe to be the most convincing argument.",5,"A Great, Non-Confrontational Look At The Jim Crow South",1219449600,"08 23, 2008",2008,1912,"['opinion', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'foremost', 'actor', 'terms', 'actual', 'talent', 'not', 'money', 'making', 'ability', 'generation', 'one', 'beef', 'often', 'been', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'almost', 'revisionist-history', 'take', 'certain', 'race', 'issues', 'such', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'story', 'Rubin', 'Hurricane', 'Carter', 'types', 'films', 'one', 'race', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'other', 'root', 'evil', 'reality', 'usually', 'never', 'case', 'When', 'viewing', 'film', 'then', 'had', 'steeled', 'sort', 'thing', 'once', 'again', 'take', 'grain', 'salt', 'mentality', 'Fortunately', 'movie', 'had', 'zero', 'problems', 'area.The', 'film', 'story', 'small', 'Wily', 'College', 'debate', 'team', '1930s', 'Texas', 'deep', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'South', 'tutelage', 'famous', 'Melvin', 'Tolson', 'took', 'all-comers', 'big', 'small', 'defeated', 'nearly', 'one', 'amazing', 'feats', 'accomplished', 'debate', 'team', 'real', 'message', 'film', 'centers', 'actual', 'issues', 'are', 'being', 'debated', 'mainly', 'having', 'do', 'civil', 'rights', 'civil', 'disobedience', 'where', 'debate', 'format', 'very', 'handy', 'sides', 'important', 'issues', 'be', 'aired', 'film', 'bias', 'show', 'Yes', 'everyone', 'own', 'opinion', 'bias', 'evident', 'film', 'not', 'go', 'that.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'also', 'terrific', 'Washington', 'cool-as-a-cucumber', 'best', 'young', 'acting', 'talent', 'forming', 'debate', 'team', 'also', 'very', 'strong', 'presence', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'plus.Overall', 'great', 'film', 'will', 'really', 'get', 'thinking', 'issues', 'plagued', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'South', 'Most', 'importantly', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'sides', 'story', 'making', 'decision', 'film', 'judges', 'decide', 'who', 'debate', 'can', 'decide', 'what', 'believe', 'be', 'most', 'convincing', 'argument']",N/A
