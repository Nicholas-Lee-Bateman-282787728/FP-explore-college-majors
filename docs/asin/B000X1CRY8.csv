I do not see where Simon Murray had very much, if anything to do with this film.  His character in the movie was portrayed as an idealistic wimp; the real Simon Murray was a very tough hombre.  The book is an essay of the brutality within the Legion, which the film has great difficulty in bringing to the screen.  The first half of Full Metal Jacket is far more effective and convincing in that respect.  I have read Legionaire three times, and was hoping the movie would convey the spirit and events contained therin.  It did not.

He wants to get far away from her and the pain, so he chooses to join the French Foreign Legion.His timing couldn't be worse --the Algerian War of Independence (1954-62) was one of the most highly traumatic conflicts for the Foreign Legion.One of the most unique aspects of the FFL is they are the only unit of the French Army open to people of any nationality.While going through some very intense training, Simon becomes friends with  fellow Legionnaires Valdes (Aitor Merino), Dupont (Tom Hardy), and Rodriguez (Javier Alcina).The young men, at first, can't wait to complete their training and go into battle. But as they enter deadly fire fights, ambushes and begin to see the realities of war and politics, they start to wonder, especially Simon.Dupont tries to show Simon it's important to be a soldier, but more important to survive. But Simon has fallen in love again, this time with Nicole (Felicite de Jeu).  At first, the would be lovers, stand on the same side of the Algerian/French conflict. The more war he sees the more he questions his position and who really is his friend, and his foe.Back in real life, Tom Hardy's engagement to actress Charlotte Riley could prove a long one.

It is an iron clad contract for 5 years during which he is sent to Algeria where the Arabs are fighting for Independence. Like ""Full Metal Jacket"" the film takes you through the rigors of training with cruel and sadistic trainers. The diverse group of trainees bond together. Simon supplies us with some boring first person narration to the background of some melancholy French tune.Simon makes it through training, and life gets better...almost. He gets a ""Dear John"" letter and wants to leave. In town he discovers the locals hate the French and want their independence. His romantic notions have placed him on the wrong side, one that he is committed to be a part. His ideas of life become confused and tested in the reality of life and conflict. There are French and Algerians who are on both sides of the independence movement, primarily for economic reasons.In many ways this movie mimics the US involvement in Vietnam, and just about any war against colonization. There is a major exception to this film in that...well I will let that one go as that becomes the twist in the tale. And even though it may be history, it was history I was unaware.The acting was acceptable. The film jumps from scene to scene. You don't know how one scene ends before you are in a scene you wonder how it began. Perhaps this was deliberately done by the director so the audience can feel the confusion of the main character, or maybe it was just poor writing and editing. This is one of those areas where one person sees genius and another sees idiot.The action is light. The drama involves mostly men. There is next to no humor.

1112844,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B000X1CRY8,Tommy Dooley,"[23, 23]","This is a 2002 film that has been re released to shamelessly cash in on the increasingly deserved success of screen hunk, Tom Hardy (`Warrior' etc). It places his name up front but he is not the star. This is the film of the auto biopgraphy by Simon Murray - `Legionnaire'. Murray is played by Paul Fox, who must be related to a side board his acting is so wooden. His previous acting highs have come in the TV soap `Coronation Street' and the voice of Corff the bartender in video game `Dragon Age II'!Well the plot goes that he gets rebuffed by a lady and in stiff upper lipped fashion he runs off to join the romance of The French Foreign Legion as his hero is Errol Flynn. His timing is pretty off as this coincides with the Algerian awakening for independence and as France has just been kicked out of Vietnam there are not that many places for him to be sent - so Algeria it is.First he has to suffer boot camp and it is really not a very nice place at all and is actually done rather well. There he meets Mr Hardy playing Dupont a Frenchman. The film follows the ever increasing fractionalisation of the authorities in Algeria as Mr Murray becomes a sort of tourist historian. He goes for walks in the souks and visits mosques to learn about the Islamic culture and it is all a bit cringe worthy, I actually thought this is all a bit history for dummies at one point.There is some action with explosives and shoot outs and an almost love interest with a certain Nicole - who phoned in her performance. It was all a bit too trite for my liking, if you know zilch about that period of history then this may have more merit as it is there is nothing new to learn here except maybe that  if you get jilted then instead of running off to join the French Foreign Legion  you may want to consider on line dating as an alternative.Fans of Tom Hardy will not be that impressed with his on screen time either and there are much better films out there; `Battle for Algiers' being a classic and the less well known `Intimate Enemies' is well worth checking out. In English and some French this is a good book that has made an average film, but if you are still interested then I would advise going pour la rental.",3,Re Released True Life account of the French Foreign Legion that really does not star Tom Hardy.,1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,2208,"['2002', 'film', 'been', 're', 'released', 'shamelessly', 'cash', 'increasingly', 'deserved', 'success', 'screen', 'hunk', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Warrior', 'etc', 'name', 'up', 'front', 'not', 'star', 'film', 'auto', 'biopgraphy', 'Simon', 'Murray', 'Legionnaire', 'Murray', 'played', 'Paul', 'Fox', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'related', 'side', 'board', 'acting', 'so', 'wooden', 'previous', 'acting', 'highs', 'have', 'come', 'TV', 'soap', 'Coronation', 'Street', 'voice', 'Corff', 'bartender', 'video', 'game', 'Dragon', 'Age', 'II', 'plot', 'rebuffed', 'lady', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lipped', 'fashion', 'join', 'romance', 'French', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'hero', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'timing', 'pretty', 'off', 'Algerian', 'awakening', 'independence', 'France', 'just', 'been', 'kicked', 'Vietnam', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'places', 'be', 'sent', 'so', 'suffer', 'boot', 'camp', 'really', 'not', 'very', 'nice', 'place', 'actually', 'done', 'rather', 'well', 'Mr', 'Hardy', 'playing', 'Dupont', 'Frenchman', 'film', 'ever', 'increasing', 'fractionalisation', 'authorities', 'Algeria', 'Mr', 'Murray', 'sort', 'tourist', 'historian', 'walks', 'souks', 'visits', 'mosques', 'learn', 'Islamic', 'culture', 'bit', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'actually', 'thought', 'bit', 'history', 'dummies', 'one', 'point.There', 'action', 'explosives', 'shoot', 'outs', 'almost', 'love', 'interest', 'certain', 'Nicole', 'who', 'phoned', 'performance', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'trite', 'liking', 'know', 'zilch', 'period', 'history', 'then', 'may', 'have', 'more', 'merit', 'nothing', 'new', 'learn', 'here', 'maybe', 'get', 'jilted', 'then', 'instead', 'running', 'off', 'join', 'French', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'may', 'want', 'consider', 'line', 'dating', 'alternative.Fans', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'impressed', 'screen', 'time', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'there', 'Battle', 'Algiers', 'being', 'classic', 'less', 'well', 'known', 'Intimate', 'Enemies', 'well', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'English', 'French', 'good', 'book', 'made', 'average', 'film', 'are', 'still', 'interested', 'then', 'would', 'advise', 'going', 'pour', 'la', 'rental']",Deserter
