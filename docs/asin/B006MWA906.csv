I had actually gotten one of those glossy cards from an Anime convention some years ago with two of the Hetalia characters (Japan and America) but that was, at the time, the most I ever knew about it.  A few months ago (yes I said months and this section of Hetalia has been around since 2010) I started watching some random clips of the show because I started to have some interest and then it was off to the races.Now that we got all that mess out of the way let's talk about the actual series itself...This series takes place between WWI and II so you will meet the ""Axis"" and the ""Allies"" mostly.  The Axis consists of the following:GermanyJapanEngland(There are others but for the purposes of this review we'll pretend they don't exist yet)The Allies are:AmericaEnglandRussiaChinaFrance(There is Canada...but no one acknowledges his existence)There are other countries that you will meet in this series that have a major/semi-major role in this series such as Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Austria, the AWESOME Prussia (And for a time he used to be the ANNOYING Prussia to me), Sealand and a variety of others...oh yeah at least one Nordic shows up...but I try to pretend he doesn't exist (If you are curious its Finland).Now let's also get to this ""Elephant in the room"":  How the countries are portrayedIn the world of Hetalia the countries are portrayed as people and have a characteristic that is a symbol of their country (Ukraine's ""Colossal Knockers"" are representative of the ""Fertile tracts of land"" in her country) so you have to take that into account when you watch it.  Also the vast majority of the countries represented in THIS series are men so if you are slightly homophobic staying away from this series might be a good idea!If you want to know my favorite country/character/voice actor in the series its Austria/Roderich Edelstein/Chuck Huber.  The ""Austrian Aristocrat"" is by far one of the coolest and funniest characters at times especially when he gets pissed.  Perfect example is episode 6 when he ""shows his utter disgust for Germany through the piano"".  I've said it aloud and I'll say it here.  If we all resolved our anger the way Austria does in this one clip the world would be a better place...just sayin'favorite clip in this season:  That's an easy one and it involves Austria and PrussiaAfter a meeting in the supermarket Austria, Switzerland and Lichtenstein go to lunch (because Austria offered and Switz is a cheapskate) and the three are at a fairly high class place.  Everything goes fine until Prussia rears his head and calls out Austria for being just as cheap as Switzerland which was funny as hell and in a bizarre way made Prussia semi-likable to me (Fan fiction did the rest)WOW okay this turned into a bit of a full length novel didn't it?  Let me wrap this up thenIf you are into historical accuracy you might not watch this but there is some cool stuff to learn even among all the slapstick and sometimes crude humor of this series.  Its definitely a series that I recommend to anyone who needs a good laugh and just wants to have fun.  We all have series' that make us laugh till it hurts well this one just about did that for me and I can't recommend it enough5*",5,History ISN'T supposed to be this FUN!,1349913600,"10 11, 2012",2012,3315,"['Alright', 'full', 'disclosure', 'time', 'am', 'one', 'Johnny', 'come', 'lately', 'people', 'Hetalia', 'party', 'had', 'actually', 'gotten', 'one', 'glossy', 'cards', 'Anime', 'convention', 'years', 'ago', 'two', 'Hetalia', 'characters', 'Japan', 'America', 'was', 'time', 'most', 'ever', 'knew', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'yes', 'said', 'months', 'section', 'Hetalia', 'been', '2010', 'started', 'watching', 'random', 'clips', 'show', 'started', 'have', 'interest', 'then', 'was', 'off', 'races.Now', 'got', 'mess', 'way', 'let', 'talk', 'actual', 'series', 'series', 'place', 'WWI', 'II', 'will', 'meet', 'Axis', 'Allies', 'mostly', 'Axis', 'following', 'GermanyJapanEngland', 'are', 'others', 'purposes', 'review', ""'ll"", 'pretend', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'yet', 'Allies', 'are', 'AmericaEnglandRussiaChinaFrance', 'Canada', 'one', 'existence', 'are', 'other', 'countries', 'will', 'meet', 'series', 'have', 'major/semi-major', 'role', 'series', 'such', 'Switzerland', 'Lichtenstein', 'Austria', 'AWESOME', 'Prussia', 'time', 'used', 'be', 'ANNOYING', 'Prussia', 'Sealand', 'variety', 'others', 'oh', 'yeah', 'least', 'one', 'Nordic', 'up', 'try', 'pretend', ""n't"", 'exist', 'are', 'curious', 'Finland', '.Now', 'let', 'also', 'get', 'Elephant', 'room', 'How', 'countries', 'are', 'world', 'Hetalia', 'countries', 'are', 'portrayed', 'people', 'have', 'characteristic', 'symbol', 'country', 'Ukraine', 'Colossal', 'Knockers', 'are', 'representative', 'Fertile', 'tracts', 'land', 'country', 'have', 'take', 'account', 'when', 'watch', 'Also', 'vast', 'majority', 'countries', 'represented', 'THIS', 'series', 'are', 'men', 'so', 'are', 'slightly', 'homophobic', 'staying', 'away', 'series', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'want', 'know', 'favorite', 'country/character/voice', 'actor', 'series', 'Austria/Roderich', 'Edelstein/Chuck', 'Huber', 'Austrian', 'Aristocrat', 'far', 'one', 'coolest', 'funniest', 'characters', 'times', 'especially', 'when', 'pissed', 'Perfect', 'example', 'episode', '6', 'when', 'utter', 'disgust', 'Germany', 'piano', ""'ve"", 'said', 'aloud', ""'ll"", 'say', 'here', 'resolved', 'anger', 'way', 'Austria', 'one', 'clip', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'place', 'just', ""sayin'favorite"", 'clip', 'season', 'easy', 'one', 'Austria', 'PrussiaAfter', 'meeting', 'supermarket', 'Austria', 'Switzerland', 'Lichtenstein', 'go', 'lunch', 'Austria', 'offered', 'Switz', 'cheapskate', 'three', 'are', 'fairly', 'high', 'class', 'place', 'Everything', 'fine', 'Prussia', 'head', 'out', 'Austria', 'being', 'just', 'as', 'cheap', 'Switzerland', 'was', 'funny', 'hell', 'bizarre', 'way', 'made', 'Prussia', 'semi-likable', 'Fan', 'fiction', 'did', 'rest', 'WOW', 'okay', 'turned', 'bit', 'full', 'length', 'novel', 'did', ""n't"", 'Let', 'wrap', 'up', 'thenIf', 'are', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'might', 'not', 'watch', 'cool', 'stuff', 'learn', 'even', 'slapstick', 'sometimes', 'crude', 'humor', 'series', 'definitely', 'series', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'laugh', 'just', 'have', 'fun', 'have', 'series', 'make', 'till', 'well', 'one', 'just', 'about', 'did', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'enough5*']",Hetalia: Axis Powers - The Complete Series

I watched and realized this show has characters as the countries, from way back to present. This show interests me because it shows each country as other countries see those countries. Example:  America is seen as a tall, good looking, blue eyes, blond haired teen that eats burgers, drinks sodas, and talks with his mouth full. Other countries are introduced with how they are perceived. This show on the serious side, explains history through out time, telling of how the Roman empire became great, it fell and now Italy is the grandson to this empire.

When I decided to watch it, I realized why so many people had been won over by Hetalia. Normally, this isn't my type of show, but I couldn't help but be won over. Hetalia tells history in a way that is entertaining and makes a person want to learn more. You can watch and laugh, and as dorky as it may sound, you're also learning. My favorite events in history- yes, history was always one of my favorite classes- have now been realized and it's fun to watch. Having countries personified as individuals also makes it more understandable and emotionally captivating.I've learned more about different countries that have always interested me and with each episode and the different ways in which it portrays historical events, I am utterly enjoying myself! Hetalia has become part of my life. To mention any moment in history covered in the show, you will think of the characters.

1517603,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B006MWA906,RavenRing,"[44, 45]","I've never read the comic, but my sister got me hooked on the anime with the words ""chibi Italy"". (chibi are tiny cute versions of a charater with biiiggg eyes)The premise of the show is simple: countries are personified as bishonen (cute boys), and historical events are played out on a personal level (such as the allying of Italy and Germany, or the interaction of Italy and The Holy Roman Empire). The episodes are about 5 minutes in length.I don't know too much about World War II, so I didn't have any problems with historical inaccuracy, on the contrary, I probably learned some things (I feel dumb, but I had never heard of the term ""Axis Powers"" before watching this show).It is easy to be offended by this show, as the characters (countries) are stereotypical- i.e. Italy is a cute, but totally dumb bishonen, who occasionally dresses up in a maid outfit and looks just like a girl. So, for example if you are Italian, you might object to your county's portrayal and/or handling of historic events. Or you might object to the turning of very serious war matters into jokes. But if you are able to look past all that you might enjoy this funny and entertaining show.I've seen this show in both Japanese and English. It is easier to watch in English, especially when a bunch of characters start talking all together very quickly (hard to read subtitles), the actors did an excellent job and the script was well adapted, with the jokes adjusted slightly to fit the language and culture. But the Japanese cast was also really good, so I am hard pressed to say which one I liked better.PS Hetalia is composed of two parts: Hetalia: Axis Powers and Hetalia: World Series.

Although some might find some character comments to be stretching the intentional offensiveness envelope beyond the pale. Having done some world travel myself, I found the series and movie does a good job of presenting national stereotypes as those from other countries see them, i.e. not just a Japanese-centric author's view. Even the English dubbed voice-overs stay true to the original's intention. An added bonus is the fact that you might even learn something historically or culturally you never heard before; Such as the existance of Sealand, proposed &#34;Marriage&#34; (mergers) of France and England, and other trivia.As a person who likes to follow politics, I found Hetalia very entertaining. Yet I dropped points for the constant interruptions with the previous episode's trailer opening previews, opening credits, the &#34;Circle Song&#34; and next episode trailers in the 5-minute episode format to be a little annoying, too redundant and a constant distraction from an otherwise entertaining product. Granted, I understand that director &#34;Bob&#34; did it that way as his way of attempting to seperate each portion into a Webcomic page, similar to &#34;Sunday Funnies&#34; style of cartooning, but IMHO it just doesn't workFor those interested in enyertainment value for their dollar; The complete seasons 1 & 2 versions contained in this version may be up your alley.",4,Geo-Politically Incorrect,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,1472,"['enjoy', 'Politically', 'Incorrect', 'humor', 'might', 'find', 'Hetalia', 'amusing', 'might', 'find', 'character', 'comments', 'be', 'stretching', 'intentional', 'offensiveness', 'envelope', 'pale', 'Having', 'done', 'world', 'travel', 'found', 'series', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'presenting', 'national', 'stereotypes', 'other', 'countries', 'see', 'i.e', 'not', 'just', 'Japanese-centric', 'author', 'view', 'Even', 'English', 'dubbed', 'voice-overs', 'stay', 'true', 'original', 'intention', 'added', 'bonus', 'fact', 'might', 'even', 'learn', 'something', 'historically', 'culturally', 'never', 'heard', 'Such', 'existance', 'Sealand', 'proposed', '34', 'Marriage', '34', 'mergers', 'France', 'England', 'other', 'trivia.As', 'person', 'who', 'follow', 'politics', 'found', 'Hetalia', 'very', 'entertaining', 'dropped', 'points', 'constant', 'interruptions', 'previous', 'episode', 'trailer', 'opening', 'previews', 'opening', 'credits', '34', 'Circle', 'Song', '34', 'next', 'episode', 'trailers', '5-minute', 'episode', 'format', 'be', 'little', 'annoying', 'too', 'redundant', 'constant', 'distraction', 'otherwise', 'entertaining', 'product', 'Granted', 'understand', 'director', '34', 'Bob', '34', 'did', 'way', 'way', 'attempting', 'seperate', 'portion', 'Webcomic', 'page', 'similar', '34', 'Sunday', 'Funnies', '34', 'style', 'cartooning', 'IMHO', 'just', ""n't"", 'workFor', 'interested', 'enyertainment', 'value', 'dollar', 'complete', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'versions', 'contained', 'version', 'may', 'be', 'up', 'alley']",Hetalia: Axis Powers - The Complete Series
