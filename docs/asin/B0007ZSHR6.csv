I am not going to comment about the show itself, since I assume if you are considering getting this DVD, so have watched it already.Bonus feature. Copyright is 2002 - just of one those TV specials they make from time to time. Not a reunion either. Just a bunch of cast interviews (with Bill Cosby showing from time to time). If you ask me, other than seeing the kids as they are now, zero value. Everyone is saying that is was fun doing the show, that it's TV history, etc... but no juice. By the way, Lisa Bonet is the only cast member that wasn't interviewed. This DVD has no subtitles or CC, which might or might not be important to you.About the episode DVDs: Well, the show was great, and so are the episodes. However these are the edited versions (22 minutes each), missing as much as 2 or 3 minutes per episode. In some of them you can tell there's something missing even't if you didn't watch the original.Also, believe it or not, the whole 2nd DVD closed captions are messed up. Each episode (and there's 8 of them in that DVD) comes with the CC from the previous episode. Surely you don't need the CC, but this just shows what a lousy release this it.So, to sum it up ... should you buy this set or not? No. Definitely not. Unless you must have some Cosby footage for some reason, do not spend a cent on this set, let alone if it's a gift for a fan.",3,Excellent show but just a regular DVD release,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,1485,"['just', 'received', 'DVD', 'set', ""'m"", 'doing', 'review', 'having', 'actually', 'watched', 'DVDs', 'not', 'memories', 'show', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'comment', 'show', 'assume', 'are', 'considering', 'getting', 'DVD', 'so', 'have', 'watched', 'already.Bonus', 'feature', 'Copyright', '2002', 'just', 'one', 'TV', 'specials', 'make', 'time', 'time', 'Not', 'reunion', 'Just', 'bunch', 'cast', 'interviews', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'showing', 'time', 'time', 'ask', 'other', 'seeing', 'kids', 'are', 'now', 'zero', 'value', 'Everyone', 'saying', 'was', 'fun', 'doing', 'show', 'TV', 'history', 'etc', 'juice', 'way', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'only', 'cast', 'member', 'was', ""n't"", 'interviewed', 'DVD', 'subtitles', 'CC', 'might', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'important', 'you.About', 'episode', 'DVDs', 'Well', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'so', 'are', 'episodes', 'However', 'are', 'edited', 'versions', '22', 'minutes', 'missing', 'as', 'much', '2', '3', 'minutes', 'episode', 'can', 'tell', 'something', 'missing', 'eve', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'original.Also', 'believe', 'not', 'whole', '2nd', 'DVD', 'closed', 'captions', 'are', 'messed', 'up', 'episode', '8', 'DVD', 'CC', 'previous', 'episode', 'Surely', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'CC', 'just', 'what', 'lousy', 'release', 'it.So', 'sum', 'up', 'should', 'buy', 'set', 'not', 'No', 'Definitely', 'not', 'must', 'have', 'Cosby', 'footage', 'reason', 'do', 'not', 'spend', 'cent', 'set', 'let', 'alone', 'gift', 'fan']",N/A

Why do we need to buy these? Once again, we can watch them for FREE MANY TIMES A DAY! The EXACT SAME WAY! We can tape them! We can Tivo them! We do not have to spend our $$$$ to own edited copies of shows we grew up on and love and can see FOR FREE MANY TIMES A DAY!So why are we dissapointed and why are we complaining? Because we WOULD pay $$$ to get these the way they were intended to be. Unedited! Would you buy a book that had 10% of the pages removed that you could read for FREE every day? Would you buy a favorite record album that had a song missing that you could hear and even tape FOR FREE every day? Would you buy a copy of a favorite movie that had 10 minutes of it cut out that you could watch for FREE every day? No. I wouldn't. Most people wouldn't. Would you buy STAR WARS with 10 minutes chopped out? Probably not.What we would like is the original versions on DVD. We WOULD pay $$$ for that.How come older shows like ""The Twilight Zone"", ""The Honeymooners"" and ""I Love Lucy"" can be released UNCUT but relatively recent shows like ""Cosby"" and ""Roseanne"" only get released in the edited versions? Answer... Because Carsey Werner doesn't care. They are lazy and didn't make ANY effort for the fans AND they aren't even up front about it. NOWHERE on these sets do they mention these are the edited incomplete versions.Heck, the ROSEANNE set even says ""THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON"" on the front! I'm sorry but 90% of the first season is NOT complete! Look at the ""FRIENDS"" DVDs! They actually ADDED footage! And they marketed them and sold them that way! We not only got the original versions, they bothered to put in EXTRA material! And I'll bet they sold ALOT more copies that way! And if 3 minutes cut out, ""doesn't really matter.."" then how much does? 5 minutes? 10?Now if all of you who are bitching about us just trying to enlighten everyone actually PREFER to have the edited versions, fine! Buy whatever the hell you like, but don't attack the true fans who actually want the complete episodes for our hard-earned $$$. If people just pony up their $$$ like obediant little sheep for this, it'll only get worse! They will think that most people just don't really care and they'll start slapping on logos on the image just like TV stations now do. There ARE already some DVDs out there like that. So, if you do care about this show and think that it DESERVES to be treated correctly, write some emails/letters to Carsey/Werner and Anchor bay and vote the only way that you can, with your wallet!Imagine how dumb you'd feel if they do release the UNCUT versions later on????",1,This HAS to stop now.....,1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,2793,"['respectfully', 'answer', 'people', 'who', 'question', 'why', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'interested', 'buying', 'heavily', 'edited', 'shows', 'are', 'not', 'buying', 'are', 'shown', 'EXACT', 'same', 'way', 'FOR', 'FREE', 'MANY', 'TIMES', 'A', 'DAY', 'Why', 'do', 'need', 'buy', 'Once', 'again', 'can', 'watch', 'FREE', 'MANY', 'TIMES', 'A', 'DAY', 'EXACT', 'SAME', 'WAY', 'can', 'tape', 'can', 'Tivo', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'spend', 'own', 'edited', 'copies', 'shows', 'grew', 'up', 'love', 'can', 'see', 'FOR', 'FREE', 'MANY', 'TIMES', 'A', 'DAY', 'So', 'why', 'are', 'dissapointed', 'why', 'are', 'complaining', 'WOULD', 'pay', 'get', 'way', 'were', 'intended', 'be', 'Unedited', 'Would', 'buy', 'book', 'had', '10', '%', 'pages', 'removed', 'could', 'read', 'FREE', 'day', 'Would', 'buy', 'favorite', 'record', 'album', 'had', 'song', 'missing', 'could', 'hear', 'even', 'tape', 'FOR', 'FREE', 'day', 'Would', 'buy', 'copy', 'favorite', 'movie', 'had', '10', 'minutes', 'cut', 'out', 'could', 'watch', 'FREE', 'day', 'No', 'would', ""n't"", 'Most', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'Would', 'buy', 'STAR', 'WARS', '10', 'minutes', 'chopped', 'out', 'Probably', 'would', 'like', 'original', 'versions', 'DVD', 'WOULD', 'pay', 'that.How', 'come', 'older', 'shows', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Honeymooners', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'can', 'be', 'released', 'UNCUT', 'relatively', 'recent', 'shows', 'Cosby', 'Roseanne', 'only', 'get', 'released', 'edited', 'versions', 'Answer', 'Carsey', 'Werner', ""n't"", 'care', 'are', 'lazy', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'ANY', 'effort', 'fans', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'up', 'front', 'NOWHERE', 'sets', 'do', 'mention', 'are', 'edited', 'incomplete', 'versions.Heck', 'ROSEANNE', 'set', 'even', 'THE', 'COMPLETE', 'FIRST', 'SEASON', 'front', ""'m"", 'sorry', '90', '%', 'first', 'season', 'NOT', 'complete', 'Look', 'FRIENDS', 'DVDs', 'actually', 'ADDED', 'footage', 'marketed', 'sold', 'way', 'not', 'only', 'got', 'original', 'versions', 'bothered', 'put', 'EXTRA', 'material', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'sold', 'ALOT', 'more', 'copies', 'way', '3', 'minutes', 'cut', 'out', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter..', 'then', 'how', 'much', '5', 'minutes', '10', 'Now', 'who', 'are', 'bitching', 'just', 'trying', 'enlighten', 'everyone', 'actually', 'PREFER', 'have', 'edited', 'versions', 'fine', 'Buy', 'hell', 'do', ""n't"", 'attack', 'true', 'fans', 'who', 'actually', 'want', 'complete', 'episodes', 'hard-earned', 'people', 'just', 'pony', 'up', 'obediant', 'little', 'sheep', ""'ll"", 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'will', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', ""'ll"", 'start', 'slapping', 'logos', 'image', 'just', 'TV', 'stations', 'now', 'do', 'ARE', 'already', 'DVDs', 'there', 'So', 'do', 'care', 'show', 'think', 'DESERVES', 'be', 'treated', 'correctly', 'write', 'emails/letters', 'Carsey/Werner', 'Anchor', 'bay', 'vote', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'wallet', 'Imagine', 'how', 'dumb', ""'d"", 'feel', 'do', 'release', 'UNCUT', 'versions', 'later']",N/A

Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[0, 1]","It's 1984 and the NBC Network is at something of a low by insisting one of their bread and butter the family sitcom is ""dead"". Well along comes Bill Cosby with a fresh idea involving a fictional family from Brooklyn Heights named the Huxtables who mimicked to a degree with he and wife Camille's real life family. The father's a doctor,the moms a lawyer and we have have five (well four in the pilot) children who would appeal to all age groups. The show skyrocketed NBC back to the top and was the #1 show in the country for five entire seasons. And it did so with an innovative concept that relied on comedy based on the real life serendipity of family life rather than shock and toilet humor. So it was a family friendly show that was funny to parents and children for different reasons and the characters were very relatible.Honestly I DON'T CARE if these shows are edited. I'd have preferred to see the full shows but it's so good to see these shows together. We have three girls as the main characters this season: Denise is a free spirited high schooler with a unique dress sense,Vanessa (the middle child in the beginning) is entering her ""tweens"" and is very intelligent and insecure and there's her youngest sister Rudy,an adorable preschooler who provides a lot of laughs and general cuteness this season. There's also Theo,the only boy in the family with an easy going if mildly underachieving demeaner. Just about every episode this season is a classic but there are some sure fire stand outs. Two of my favorites involve Theo:in ""The Shirt Story"" he finds himself in the possition of Dennise making a replica of a $90 shirt he's forced to take back (or so he thinks) and the result is one of Theo's most comical moments in the series. Later on in ""Theo And The Joint"" he's forced to contend with a student planting a joint on him,which concerns Theo as much as his parents as he is NOT into drugs and makes it abundantly clear.During this season the Huxtables are by and large a charming,engaging family unit. In later seasons the reality of life would harden some of the characters to some degree even if the show always remained family friendly. Even so this particular season has a special charm to me seeing these characters we lived with every Thursday night for eight seasons at such a young age,especially the first three episodes when Theo actually still sounded like a little boy when he talked-this is especially obvious in the pilot. So even if these are the syndicated versions of the shows it's worth having for the quality of what's year and the excellent bonus features,including a looking back-style documentary.",5,Enter The Huxtables,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,2642,"['1984', 'NBC', 'Network', 'something', 'low', 'insisting', 'one', 'bread', 'butter', 'family', 'sitcom', 'dead', 'Well', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'fresh', 'idea', 'involving', 'fictional', 'family', 'Brooklyn', 'Heights', 'named', 'Huxtables', 'who', 'mimicked', 'degree', 'wife', 'Camille', 'real', 'life', 'family', 'father', 'doctor', 'moms', 'lawyer', 'have', 'have', 'five', 'well', 'four', 'pilot', 'children', 'who', 'would', 'appeal', 'age', 'groups', 'show', 'skyrocketed', 'NBC', 'back', 'top', 'was', '1', 'show', 'country', 'five', 'entire', 'seasons', 'did', 'so', 'innovative', 'concept', 'relied', 'comedy', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'serendipity', 'family', 'life', 'rather', 'shock', 'toilet', 'humor', 'was', 'family', 'friendly', 'show', 'was', 'funny', 'parents', 'children', 'different', 'reasons', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'relatible.Honestly', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'CARE', 'shows', 'are', 'edited', ""'d"", 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'full', 'shows', 'so', 'good', 'see', 'shows', 'together', 'have', 'three', 'girls', 'main', 'characters', 'season', 'Denise', 'free', 'spirited', 'high', 'schooler', 'unique', 'dress', 'sense', 'Vanessa', 'middle', 'child', 'beginning', 'entering', 'tweens', 'very', 'intelligent', 'insecure', 'youngest', 'sister', 'Rudy', 'adorable', 'preschooler', 'who', 'lot', 'laughs', 'general', 'cuteness', 'season', 'also', 'Theo', 'only', 'boy', 'family', 'easy', 'going', 'mildly', 'underachieving', 'demeaner', 'Just', 'episode', 'season', 'classic', 'are', 'sure', 'fire', 'stand', 'outs', 'Two', 'favorites', 'involve', 'Theo', 'Shirt', 'Story', 'possition', 'Dennise', 'making', 'replica', '90', 'shirt', 'forced', 'take', 'back', 'so', 'result', 'one', 'Theo', 'most', 'comical', 'moments', 'series', 'Later', 'Theo', 'Joint', 'forced', 'contend', 'student', 'planting', 'joint', 'Theo', 'as', 'much', 'parents', 'NOT', 'drugs', 'abundantly', 'clear.During', 'season', 'Huxtables', 'are', 'large', 'charming', 'engaging', 'family', 'unit', 'later', 'seasons', 'reality', 'life', 'would', 'harden', 'characters', 'degree', 'even', 'show', 'always', 'remained', 'family', 'friendly', 'Even', 'particular', 'season', 'special', 'charm', 'seeing', 'characters', 'lived', 'Thursday', 'night', 'eight', 'seasons', 'young', 'age', 'especially', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'when', 'Theo', 'actually', 'still', 'sounded', 'little', 'boy', 'when', 'especially', 'obvious', 'pilot', 'So', 'even', 'are', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'shows', 'worth', 'having', 'quality', 'what', 'year', 'excellent', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'looking', 'back-style', 'documentary']",N/A
896828,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B0007ZSHR6,andy8047,"[6, 8]","Classic television fans have been waiting for this for a very long time now. THE COSBY SHOW premiered on September 20,1984 the very same day ABC's WHO'S THE BOSS? premiered. This is the first African-American sitcom to feature a large brood. TCS,along with WTB of course,killed CBS's THE JEFFERSONS in the Nielsen ratings(TCS's and WTB's first seasons in 1984-85 were THE JEFFERSONS' last). TCS,co-created by star Bill Cosby,is very much like Cosby's real-life family. Yes,the legendary comedian has five children of his own(one who is now deceased). In the opening credits,we don't see Cosby appearing in name after the word ""starring"". Following ""starring"",is Phylicia Ayers-Allen(later Rashad) who plays Clair Hanks Huxtable,a legal aid attorney whose husband Heathcliff or simply Cliff(Cosby) is an obstetrician/pediatrician/gynecologist. Unbelievably,all three major networks rejected the TCS pilot. Only NBC had the heart to accept it at the second offering. Originally,Cliff and Clair were supposed to have blue-collar jobs but Cosby's real-life wife Camille talked him into changing those jobs to professional white-collar ones. Cliff's and Clair's children are Denise(Lisa Bonet),an eleventh grade student who is of course checking out boys. Pre-teen Vanessa(Tempest Bledsoe) and 5-year-old Rudith or simply Rudy(Keshia Knight Pulliam) are sharing a bedroom together. Theodore or simply Theo(Malcolm Jamal Warner),is a ninth grade student who attends the same high school as Denise. The oldest of the five Huxtable kids is Sondra,who is away at Princeton University. Sondra is played by Sabrina LeBeauf. Sondra was recurring this season so LeBeauf did not appear in the opening montage. Sondra first appeared in the episode ""Bon Jour Sondra"",which first aired on November 22,1984,Thanksgiving Day. In the episode,Cliff hires Theo to carve the Huxtables' Thanksgiving turkey. Episode #1,the untitled pilot,contains a variety of situations that Cosby mentioned in his film BILL COSBY HIMSELF. Cliff advises an expectant father to cheer for his in-labor wife(""PUSH 'EM OUT,SHOVE 'EM OUT,WAY OUT!""),Cliff is sent by Clair to Theo's bedroom to kill Theo(with a baseball bat) due to poor grades on his report card,Rudy ends up with shampoo-laden eyes while showering with Vanessa(Rudy thought she'd end up blind for life),Clair tells Cliff what a beautiful woman she was before the children came,Cliff hopes the children will leave before he and Clair die,and Clair asks Cliff why the couple only had four children. Cliff replied,""We did not want five!"". The couple should have added one to their numbers as a result of accidentally excluding Sondra. Some of the pilot became stock footage for a few later episodes including the 1992 series finale. Other highlights from the first season include Lena Horne singing at Cliff's birthday party(the season finale),Tony Castillo(Tony Orlando) running a community center,a funeral for Rudy's beloved goldfish Lamont(the Huxtables actually dress up for the funeral as if the deceased was human!),Rudy pretending her teddy bear Bobo has a high fever while Rudy herself actually battles a sore throat,Theo having one of his ears pierced,and Cliff running a track for competition purposes. In the opening montage,the cast are seen playing sports in a park. The closing montages feature,clips in motion from every episode. One of the cast would say,""The Cosby Show was videotaped in front of a live studio audience."". This includes Cosby who did that several times himself this season and only this season. Unlike many other television series,this one was taped in New York. For some reason,Cosby disliked working in California. I think Cosby chose to tape the show in New York so he wouldn't have to commute so far from his Massachusetts home. At the beginning of season 2 and afterward,we see the cast moving in rhythm,or dancing.",5,Meet the Huxtables!,1112659200,"04 5, 2005",2005,3874,"['Classic', 'television', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'COSBY', 'SHOW', 'premiered', 'September', '20,1984', 'very', 'same', 'day', 'ABC', 'WHO', 'THE', 'BOSS', 'premiered', 'first', 'African-American', 'sitcom', 'feature', 'large', 'brood', 'TCS', 'WTB', 'course', 'killed', 'CBS', 'THE', 'JEFFERSONS', 'Nielsen', 'ratings', 'TCS', 'WTB', 'first', 'seasons', '1984-85', 'were', 'THE', 'JEFFERSONS', 'last', 'TCS', 'co-created', 'star', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'very', 'much', 'Cosby', 'real-life', 'family', 'Yes', 'legendary', 'comedian', 'five', 'children', 'own', 'one', 'who', 'now', 'deceased', 'opening', 'credits', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Cosby', 'appearing', 'name', 'word', 'starring', 'Following', 'starring', 'Phylicia', 'Ayers-Allen', 'later', 'Rashad', 'who', 'Clair', 'Hanks', 'Huxtable', 'legal', 'aid', 'attorney', 'husband', 'Heathcliff', 'simply', 'Cliff', 'Cosby', 'obstetrician/pediatrician/gynecologist', 'Unbelievably', 'three', 'major', 'networks', 'rejected', 'TCS', 'pilot', 'Only', 'NBC', 'had', 'heart', 'accept', 'second', 'offering', 'Originally', 'Cliff', 'Clair', 'were', 'supposed', 'have', 'blue-collar', 'jobs', 'Cosby', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Camille', 'talked', 'changing', 'jobs', 'professional', 'white-collar', 'ones', 'Cliff', 'Clair', 'children', 'are', 'Denise', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'eleventh', 'grade', 'student', 'who', 'course', 'checking', 'out', 'boys', 'Pre-teen', 'Vanessa', 'Tempest', 'Bledsoe', '5-year-old', 'Rudith', 'simply', 'Rudy', 'Keshia', 'Knight', 'Pulliam', 'are', 'sharing', 'bedroom', 'together', 'Theodore', 'simply', 'Theo', 'Malcolm', 'Jamal', 'Warner', 'ninth', 'grade', 'student', 'who', 'same', 'high', 'school', 'Denise', 'oldest', 'five', 'Huxtable', 'kids', 'Sondra', 'who', 'away', 'Princeton', 'University', 'Sondra', 'played', 'Sabrina', 'LeBeauf', 'Sondra', 'was', 'recurring', 'season', 'so', 'LeBeauf', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'opening', 'montage', 'Sondra', 'first', 'appeared', 'episode', 'Bon', 'Jour', 'Sondra', 'first', 'aired', 'November', '22,1984', 'Thanksgiving', 'Day', 'episode', 'Cliff', 'Theo', 'carve', 'Huxtables', 'Thanksgiving', 'turkey', 'Episode', '1', 'untitled', 'pilot', 'variety', 'situations', 'Cosby', 'mentioned', 'film', 'BILL', 'COSBY', 'HIMSELF', 'Cliff', 'expectant', 'father', 'cheer', 'in-labor', 'wife', 'PUSH', 'OUT', 'SHOVE', 'OUT', 'WAY', 'OUT', 'Cliff', 'sent', 'Clair', 'Theo', 'bedroom', 'kill', 'Theo', 'baseball', 'bat', 'due', 'poor', 'grades', 'report', 'card', 'Rudy', 'up', 'shampoo-laden', 'eyes', 'showering', 'Vanessa', 'Rudy', 'thought', ""'d"", 'end', 'up', 'blind', 'life', 'Clair', 'Cliff', 'what', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'was', 'children', 'came', 'Cliff', 'children', 'will', 'leave', 'Clair', 'die', 'Clair', 'Cliff', 'why', 'couple', 'only', 'had', 'four', 'children', 'Cliff', 'replied', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'five', 'couple', 'should', 'have', 'added', 'one', 'numbers', 'result', 'accidentally', 'excluding', 'Sondra', 'pilot', 'became', 'stock', 'footage', 'few', 'later', 'including', '1992', 'series', 'finale', 'Other', 'highlights', 'first', 'season', 'include', 'Lena', 'Horne', 'singing', 'Cliff', 'birthday', 'party', 'season', 'finale', 'Tony', 'Castillo', 'Tony', 'Orlando', 'running', 'community', 'center', 'funeral', 'Rudy', 'beloved', 'goldfish', 'Lamont', 'Huxtables', 'actually', 'up', 'funeral', 'deceased', 'was', 'human', 'Rudy', 'pretending', 'teddy', 'bear', 'Bobo', 'high', 'fever', 'Rudy', 'actually', 'sore', 'throat', 'Theo', 'having', 'one', 'ears', 'pierced', 'Cliff', 'running', 'track', 'competition', 'purposes', 'opening', 'montage', 'cast', 'are', 'seen', 'playing', 'sports', 'park', 'closing', 'feature', 'clips', 'motion', 'episode', 'One', 'cast', 'would', 'say', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'was', 'videotaped', 'front', 'live', 'studio', 'audience.', 'Cosby', 'who', 'did', 'several', 'times', 'season', 'only', 'season', 'many', 'other', 'television', 'series', 'one', 'was', 'taped', 'New', 'York', 'reason', 'Cosby', 'disliked', 'working', 'California', 'think', 'Cosby', 'chose', 'tape', 'show', 'New', 'York', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'commute', 'so', 'far', 'Massachusetts', 'home', 'beginning', 'season', '2', 'afterward', 'see', 'cast', 'moving', 'rhythm', 'dancing']",N/A
896829,A1T9PJBFBFKSGD,B0007ZSHR6,Auburn Niewiadomski,"[2, 2]","I have always enjoyed the Cosby Show, because not only was the humor clean, but it was hilarious as well. I especially loved that the writers didn't focus on the family's race, the Huxtable's just lived a normal everyday life just like any other family. Bill Cosby (Heathcliff Huxtable) was just terrific, and really knows how to make people laugh without using ridiculous scenarios and slap-stick comedy. And I really liked that Phylicia Rashad (Clair Huxtable) wasn't just an ordinary TV wife, she has just a big a role as Bill did, and many times had entire scenes to herself. But I think the main reason this show was successful was because of the Huxtable kids. They were so normal, there wasn't a stupid older brother, or a smart-alecky sister, or a genius kid. And that's why I could relate to the Huxtable's, they were so believable. So this is why I was very excited to purchase season one, but I was unfortunately displeased with the DVD.Urban Works released all twenty-four episodes BUT, (there always is a but isn't there) each episode has about one to two minutes cut off of it. Now most fans will be outraged as I about this DVD release and some might not even buy this set, but I would like to remind you there is some bonus material that's hard to find. There's a pretty interesting ninety minute special that aired on May 19, 2002 called ""The Cosby Show: A Look Back which has interviews with the cast, bloopers, and auditions which makes this set worth the buy. And a nice addition to this set is a pamphlet which includes a word from Bill Cosby, season one's episode descriptions, the Nielsen Ratings for seasons one through seven and highlights from season one. So you have to decide, is it worth buying season one for the bonus material, or not. I really wanted the bonus material and it is nice to be able to watch episodes whenever you feel like so I decided to purchase it. There are many great episodes from season one and one of my favorites is ""Back to the Track, Jack"" when Cliff ""Combustible"" Huxtable runs a race against his rival Sanford B. ""Tailwind"" Turner. (Played by Josh Culbreath) But there are so many great ones, and if you would like to know some of the other episodes from season one here is an episode description.Pilot - Airdate: 9/20/1984 - Cliff and Clair deal with the daily pressures of having children, Theo receives a bad report card, Denise goes out on a date andRudy is afraid to go back asleep because she thinks the wolf man is in her closet.Goodbye Mr. Fish - Airdate: 9/27/1984 - Rudy's pet fish dies, and Cliff decides to have a funeral for Rudy's fish.Bad Dreams - Airdate: 10/4/1984 - Vanessa has nightmares after watching a scary movie and Cliff and Clair try to help Vanessa overcome her fear.Is That My Boy? - Airdate: 10/11/1984 - Theo joins the football team.The Shirt Story - Airdate: 10/19/1964 - Theo wants to impress a girl by wearing an expensive shirt but since Cliff and Clair will not pay for it, Denise offers to make a copy of the shirt for him.Breaking with Tradition - Airdate: 10/25/1984 - Cliff's father, Russell Huxtable, pays a visit and begins questioning Cliff about the kid's college choices.One More Time - Airdate: 11/1/1984 - While Clair cares for a friend's baby, she begins to consider having another.Play it Again, Vanessa - Airdate: 11/8/1984 - Vanessa is having a hard time practicing the Clarinet for her school concert.How Ugly is He - Airdate: 11/15/1984 - Denise has a new boyfriend, but is reluctant to tell Cliff.Bon Jour, Sondra - Airdate: 11/22/1984 - Sondra plans on going to Paris for the summer with her friends, and while Clair agrees to let her go, Sondra still needs Cliff's permission.You're not a Mother Tonight - Airdate: 12/6/1984 - Clair is exhausted from constantly caring for the children so Cliff decides to take her out for a romantic evening and a stay at a fancy hotel.Rudy's Sick - Airdate: 12/13/1984 - Rudy is sick, so Cliff takes care of her.Father's Day - Airdate: Airdate: 12/20/1984 -  Cliff complains about the poor quality of his annual Father's Day gifts and he challenges the children to find some better presents for father's day.Independence Day - Airdate: 1/10/1985 - Theo gets his ear pierced and he doesn't want Cliff and Clair to find out.Physician of the Year - Airdate: 1/17/1985 - Cliff is set to receive an important award, but a woman goes into labor right before the ceremony, and Theo is asked to give the speech.Jitterbug Break - Airdate: 1/31/1985 - Cliff tries to impress Denise's friends by teaching them how to jitterbug.Theo and the Joint - Airdate: 2/7/1985 - Cliff discovers a cigarette in Theo's school book.Vanessa's New Class - Airdate: 2/14/1985 - Vanessa creates a model of the solar system for her science class, but is disappointed when she finds out how much better the other kids ones are.Clair's Case - Airdate: 2/21/1984 - A sneaky mechanic tries to swindle Sondra, so Clair takes on the case.Back to the Track, Jack - Airdate: 2/29/1985 - Cliff's college track coach contacts him and asks to run in a charity event between Hillman and its rival, Norton College.The Younger Women - Airdate: 3/14/1985 - Cliff and Clair receive a visit from an old friend and when he arrives he is accompanied with a new girlfriend that is half his age.Slumber Party - Airdate: 3/29/1985 - Rudy invites all of her friends over for a slumber party.Mr. Quiet - Airdate: 5/2/1985 - Cliff, Clair and Theo volunteer at a local community center, while they're there, Theo notices a battered boy and tries to find help, and the owner does his best to lend assistance.Cliff's Birthday - Airdate: 5/9/1985 - Cliff is turning 48, and as usual, he is trying to find out what his birthday present is ahead of time.So you have to decide for yourself if this collection is worth buying, yes the edited episodes that are being included on this set is frustrating, but they're still being edited for syndication on television and they're only shown at a specific time. And if you own season one on DVD you can watch an episode whenever you feel like it, and be able to watch interesting bonus material, so this product is only mildly recommended.",3,The Cosby Show

The ones who are compelled to silent my reviews of ""The Great Cosby Show,"" because I dare to call it as I see it. So...I find it amusing that my original review of this drek of a program was muted- I'm sure there's some PC monitors who found it offensive that anyone dared to diss the great Cosby Show. That was actually part of the point of my original review. It was praised for it's ""wholesomeness, great role models for African Americans"" during a decade of Eddie Murphy type comedy, etc. But none of that makes this a good, much less great show. This has all the appeal of ""Full House,' minus the ""You got it dudes."" So it is worthy of sitting the kiddies in front of the TV to watch. How any adult could stomach it, especially in hindsight amazes me to this day. It's full of ""Awwwww"" type cutesiness, endless pounding of ad-nauseum scholastical preachiness, and feel good fashion statements, as it were. All of which perfectly fits the mold of ""The Brady Bunch."" In fact, this show is the Brady Bunch of the 1980s (compare the 2 series and prove me wrong). It's a meandering, pandering, suck up of a show that is funny only to those who are laughing before the show even begins. It typifies the other over rated, unfunny sitcoms of the 80s that were celebrated because TV had to hand out awards to someone. So why not hand it to the wholesome Huxtables, no matter how hammy, saccharine, predictable, redundant and horribly written and acted it is. This is the most over rated ""comedy"" in the history of TV. Don't waste your time or money. You want the best Cosby comedy ever with lessons and morals to boot, buy the ""Fat Albert"" cartoon series. It was actually funny. This one is just plain corny, predictable,  sappy, and so sweet it hurts your teeth. And Phylicia Rashad brings to TV the most annoying character since Granny Clampet of  ""The Beverly Hillbillies."" The fact that this show was number one for so long is an indictment of how much garbage TV is able to cram down viewers throats- a testament to P.T. Barnum's ""there's a sucker born every minute."" Remember, ""Love Boat"" and ""Fantasy Island"" too were huge ratings winners.

However, if you're a generous buyer there's still a plethora of good content here.

It's just a lot of fun and what I really liked about the series is that whenever they ran out of ideas for an episode, instead of doing a clip show, they would just do an episode where everyone dances and we get a dance episode in this season. (Jitterbug Break) The 90 minute special that takes up the fourth disc was interesting to watch, it showed snippets from the entire series and we get hear from all the cast (except Lisa Bonet) as well as other celebrities about the impact of the show.

896834,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0007ZSHR6,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[70, 81]","Nominated for 29 Emmys, and winner of six including Outstanding Comedy Series, The Cosby Show dominated prime-time TV from the mid- to late-eighties. The brainchild of popular comedian Bill Cosby, the series followed the life and times of a normal upper-middle class African-American family. One of the most successful sitcoms in network television history, The Cosby Show earned the #1 Nielsen rating for five consecutive years (1985-1990), and in its eight seasons it never dropped out of the Top 20. Coupled with the hit comedy series Cheers, the two shows made Thursday nights a weekly ratings sweep for NBC...The Cosby Show is set in a New York brownstone where Heathcliff ""Cliff"" Huxtable (Bill Cosby) and his wife Clair (Phylicia Rashad) live with their five children - Sondra (Sabrina Le Beauf), Denise (Lisa Bonet), Theo (Malcolm-Jamal Warner), Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe), and Rudy (Keshia Knight Pulliam). Cliff is a popular obstetrician/gynecologist who runs his practice out of the home's basement (which has its own street entrance), while Clair is a successful attorney with a local law firm. In the first season, Sondra is not seen because she's attending Princeton, but she and her boyfriend (and later husband) Elvin (Geoffrey Owens) become major characters in subsequent seasons. Most of the comic relief derives from Cliff and Clair's struggles with their children and the often stupid things they do, but in general, the family gets along very well. If The Simpsons are the quintessential dysfunctional TV family, then The Cosby Show is illustrative of the ideal real-life family. Bad language is non-existent in the series, and it showcases a plethora of African-American role models such as Stevie Wonder, Lena Horne, and Sammy Davis Jr. One of the best written sitcoms since I Love Lucy, The Cosby Show holds its own in the hallowed halls of the TV elite...The Cosby Show (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere in which Theo returns from school sporting a report card with 4 D's. Believing he doesn't need to go to college, Theo is given a memorable lesson (using Monopoly money) by Cliff - prompting him to vow to do his best from now on.

Since this was the pilot, the characters and their lives had yet to be firmly established... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Mr. Fish"" in which the family participates in a formal toilet funeral for Rudy's dead goldfish, and ""Father's Day"" in which Cliff rebels against the oddball Father's Day presents he's received over the years, such as a giant polka-dot tie with twinkling lights...Below is a list of episodes included on The Cosby Show (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (The Pilot)Episode 2 (Mr. Fish)Episode 3 (Bad Dreams)Episode 4 (Is That My Boy?)Episode 5 (A Shirt Story)Episode 6 (Breaking With Tradition)Episode 7 (One More Time)Episode 8 (Play It Again, Vanessa)Episode 9 (How Ugly Is He?)Episode 10 (Bon Jour Sondra)Episode 11 (You're Not a Mother Night)Episode 12 (Rudy's Sick)Episode 13 (Father's Day)Episode 14 (Independence Day)Episode 15 (Physician of the Year)Episode 16 (Jitterbug Break)Episode 17 (Theo and the Joint)Episode 18 (Vanessa's New Class)Episode 19 (Clair's Case)Episode 20 (Back to the Track, Jack)Episode 21 (The Younger Woman)Episode 22 (Slumber Party)Episode 23 (Mr. Quiet)Episode 24 (Cliff's Birthday)The DVD Report",5,One of the best sitcoms ever!,1115769600,"05 11, 2005",2005,3504,"['Nominated', '29', 'Emmys', 'winner', 'six', 'including', 'Outstanding', 'Comedy', 'Series', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'dominated', 'prime-time', 'TV', 'mid-', 'late-eighties', 'brainchild', 'popular', 'comedian', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'series', 'followed', 'life', 'times', 'normal', 'upper-middle', 'class', 'African-American', 'family', 'One', 'most', 'successful', 'sitcoms', 'network', 'television', 'history', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'earned', '1', 'Nielsen', 'rating', 'five', 'consecutive', 'years', '1985-1990', 'eight', 'seasons', 'never', 'dropped', 'Top', '20', 'Coupled', 'hit', 'comedy', 'series', 'Cheers', 'two', 'shows', 'made', 'Thursday', 'nights', 'weekly', 'ratings', 'sweep', 'NBC', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'brownstone', 'where', 'Heathcliff', 'Cliff', 'Huxtable', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'wife', 'Clair', 'Phylicia', 'Rashad', 'live', 'five', 'children', 'Sondra', 'Sabrina', 'Le', 'Beauf', 'Denise', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'Theo', 'Malcolm-Jamal', 'Warner', 'Vanessa', 'Tempestt', 'Bledsoe', 'Rudy', 'Keshia', 'Knight', 'Pulliam', 'Cliff', 'popular', 'obstetrician/gynecologist', 'who', 'practice', 'home', 'basement', 'own', 'street', 'entrance', 'Clair', 'successful', 'attorney', 'local', 'law', 'firm', 'first', 'season', 'Sondra', 'not', 'seen', 'attending', 'Princeton', 'boyfriend', 'later', 'husband', 'Elvin', 'Geoffrey', 'Owens', 'become', 'major', 'characters', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'Most', 'comic', 'relief', 'derives', 'Cliff', 'Clair', 'struggles', 'children', 'often', 'stupid', 'things', 'do', 'general', 'family', 'along', 'very', 'well', 'Simpsons', 'are', 'quintessential', 'dysfunctional', 'TV', 'family', 'then', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'illustrative', 'ideal', 'real-life', 'family', 'Bad', 'language', 'non-existent', 'series', 'plethora', 'African-American', 'role', 'models', 'such', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'Lena', 'Horne', 'Sammy', 'Davis', 'Jr.', 'One', 'best', 'written', 'sitcoms', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'own', 'hallowed', 'halls', 'TV', 'elite', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Theo', 'returns', 'school', 'sporting', 'report', 'card', '4', 'D', 'Believing', ""n't"", 'need', 'go', 'college', 'Theo', 'given', 'memorable', 'lesson', 'using', 'Monopoly', 'money', 'Cliff', 'prompting', 'vow', 'do', 'best', 'now', 'episode', 'especially', 'interesting', 'given', 'various', 'aspects', 'family', 'home', 'are', 'different', 'rest', 'series', 'was', 'pilot', 'characters', 'lives', 'had', 'yet', 'be', 'firmly', 'established', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'include', 'Mr', 'Fish', 'family', 'formal', 'toilet', 'funeral', 'Rudy', 'dead', 'goldfish', 'Father', 'Day', 'Cliff', 'rebels', 'oddball', 'Father', 'Day', 'received', 'years', 'such', 'giant', 'polka-dot', 'tie', 'twinkling', 'lights', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'Episode', '1', 'Pilot', 'Episode', '2', 'Mr', 'Fish', 'Episode', '3', 'Bad', 'Dreams', 'Episode', '4', 'Boy', 'Episode', '5', 'Shirt', 'Story', 'Episode', '6', 'Breaking', 'Tradition', 'Episode', '7', 'One', 'More', 'Time', 'Episode', '8', 'Play', 'Again', 'Vanessa', 'Episode', '9', 'How', 'Ugly', 'Episode', '10', 'Bon', 'Jour', 'Sondra', 'Episode', '11', ""'re"", 'Not', 'Mother', 'Night', 'Episode', '12', 'Rudy', 'Sick', 'Episode', '13', 'Father', 'Day', 'Episode', '14', 'Independence', 'Day', 'Episode', '15', 'Physician', 'Year', 'Episode', '16', 'Jitterbug', 'Break', 'Episode', '17', 'Theo', 'Joint', 'Episode', '18', 'Vanessa', 'New', 'Class', 'Episode', '19', 'Clair', 'Case', 'Episode', '20', 'Back', 'Track', 'Jack', 'Episode', '21', 'Younger', 'Woman', 'Episode', '22', 'Slumber', 'Party', 'Episode', '23', 'Mr.', 'Quiet', 'Episode', '24', 'Cliff', 'Birthday', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

896839,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B0007ZSHR6,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[2, 11]","I find it somewhat difficult to review this show without playing it off of the recent controversy Bill Cosby has found himself in, so I won't. Cosby has recently accused the black community of setting itself up for failure because of the way they raise their kids. After watching this show it is painfully obvious that this issue was on his mind way back in 1984. So in the heart of the Reagan administration Bill Cosby arrives on the scene to teach black America that they should. . .well. . .value success above all and only partake in fun that is sanctioned by The Man.  I'm sure from his perspective he felt very justified. He simply did not want his kids growing up thinking that all they could do in life was shine Whitey's shoes. Why not teach them that they too could grow up to be doctors or lawyers? Why not teach them that they could be rich? And I agree with all that. I just also look at the 1984 electoral map and think that maybe he was simply preaching to the choir.  To me the show was much more valuable when it was looking at the gap between the generations.  My favorite episode, by far, was the one in which Denise brings home her free spirit of a boyfriend.  For once Cliff actually gets a taste of his own medicine. For once the viewer gets to see a point of view that is legitimately different than the one the show peddles.  Obviously in the end that character had to be toppled so that Cliff can stand victorious, but the trip along the way is hilarious. The dance off between generations and Cliff trying to maintain order over Rudy's sleep-over also leap to mind as favorite moments of Season 1. Of course this season has its fair share of throw away episodes (see: The one where Cliff races his nemesis from his golden track days) and overly moralistic ones (see: Theo and the Joint). Still the best way to describe this show is sugary but good. For all of the sentimental hits this season has (Father's Day), it has a miss to go with it (Thanksgiving). I also got very tired of all the complaining the parents did. If this is what Bill Cosby sees as the ideal lifestyle for black families then maybe he should have had his characters whine less. If you don't like working 18 hours days, get a new job. If you don't like your kids buying $90 shirts, don't teach them that money is the end all. Throughout the season I almost universally disagreed with Cliff, though that doesn't mean his heart was in the wrong place. He's hardly Ken Lay. And if he truly did help America see a successful, happy black family as normal, then more power to him. 6.91 out of 10.",3,More Fun than working an 18 Hour Day,1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,2588,"['find', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'review', 'show', 'playing', 'recent', 'controversy', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'found', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Cosby', 'recently', 'accused', 'black', 'community', 'setting', 'up', 'failure', 'way', 'raise', 'kids', 'watching', 'show', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'issue', 'was', 'mind', 'way', 'back', '1984', 'So', 'heart', 'Reagan', 'administration', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'scene', 'teach', 'black', 'America', 'should', '.well', '.value', 'success', 'only', 'partake', 'fun', 'sanctioned', 'Man', ""'m"", 'sure', 'perspective', 'felt', 'very', 'justified', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'kids', 'growing', 'up', 'thinking', 'could', 'do', 'life', 'was', 'shine', 'Whitey', 'shoes', 'Why', 'not', 'teach', 'too', 'could', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'doctors', 'lawyers', 'Why', 'not', 'teach', 'could', 'be', 'rich', 'agree', 'just', 'also', 'look', '1984', 'electoral', 'map', 'think', 'maybe', 'was', 'simply', 'preaching', 'choir', 'show', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'valuable', 'when', 'was', 'looking', 'gap', 'generations', 'favorite', 'episode', 'far', 'was', 'one', 'Denise', 'home', 'free', 'spirit', 'boyfriend', 'once', 'Cliff', 'actually', 'taste', 'own', 'medicine', 'once', 'viewer', 'see', 'point', 'view', 'legitimately', 'different', 'one', 'show', 'Obviously', 'end', 'character', 'had', 'be', 'toppled', 'so', 'Cliff', 'can', 'stand', 'victorious', 'trip', 'way', 'hilarious', 'dance', 'off', 'generations', 'Cliff', 'trying', 'maintain', 'order', 'Rudy', 'sleep-over', 'also', 'mind', 'favorite', 'moments', 'Season', '1', 'course', 'season', 'fair', 'share', 'throw', 'away', 'see', 'one', 'where', 'Cliff', 'nemesis', 'golden', 'track', 'days', 'overly', 'moralistic', 'ones', 'see', 'Theo', 'Joint', 'Still', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'show', 'sugary', 'good', 'sentimental', 'hits', 'season', 'Father', 'Day', 'miss', 'go', 'Thanksgiving', 'also', 'got', 'very', 'tired', 'complaining', 'parents', 'did', 'what', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'ideal', 'lifestyle', 'black', 'families', 'then', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'characters', 'whine', 'less', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'working', '18', 'hours', 'days', 'get', 'new', 'job', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'kids', 'buying', '90', 'shirts', 'do', ""n't"", 'teach', 'money', 'end', 'season', 'almost', 'universally', 'disagreed', 'Cliff', ""n't"", 'mean', 'heart', 'was', 'wrong', 'place', 'hardly', 'Ken', 'Lay', 'truly', 'did', 'help', 'America', 'see', 'successful', 'happy', 'black', 'family', 'normal', 'then', 'more', 'power', '6.91', '10']",N/A

896848,A10DQWWRKGQ6FY,B0007ZSHR6,"Eric B. Gordon ""The greatest thing we ever ha...","[1, 1]","Frankly, I'm just thankful that I've got easy access to the memories this season inspires without commercial interruptions.  Not knowing how many networks air the show (and wondering how many show the full-length renditions), I say, ""There's plenty of joy and soul in what's here for everyone!""  This collection contains everything I've always enjoyed about the beginning of The Cosby Show, including some pieces I dudn't remember before I found this set.  These include great episodes like ""Bon Jour Sondra,"" ""Kight to Night"" and ""One More Time.""I grew up with this show; the pilot first aired when I was four, and my whole family watched the show right until the finale of Season 8.  And, Dr. Cosby (yes, he's a doctor of education) proved time and again throughout the series that education is as important to everyone as entertainment.Of most significance to me in the here-and-now (2008) is the hour-and-a-half documentary from 2005, The Cosby Show: A Look Back.  (Even without Lisa Bonet, that special is just that, special.)  That DVD, combined with all the memories of the regular series kept me captivated when I first happend onto it.  My copy arrived March 11, 2008, and I watched it at least a little bit every day for eight days afterwards.  It won't grow old anytime soon.Also, as a musician, I have a great appreciation for the series score, including all the neat Stu Gardner tidbits with the saxophones and phase-shifted Rhodes piano.  If I've got any real interest in Jazz, it largely stems from the music of this show.[One thing I didn't realize during the series run is how much Dr. Huxtable's job seemed to be a kind of sideshow, in which all these silly characters materialized.  This element appeared in episodes like the pilot, ""Rudy's Sick,"" ""Theo and the Joint,"" ""Father's Day"" and ""Physician of the Year,"" along with multiple episodes from following seasons.]Someday, I'll get the coveted Columbia House set.  For now, I'm sticking with these.  (It would be nice to know if the full-length cut of the pilot includes an example of Dr. Cosby's macho breathing taken (like much of the pilot material) from the HBO special, Bill Cosby Himself.)",5,Just glad to have the memories!,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,2167,"['Frankly', ""'m"", 'just', 'thankful', ""'ve"", 'got', 'easy', 'access', 'memories', 'season', 'commercial', 'interruptions', 'Not', 'knowing', 'how', 'many', 'networks', 'air', 'show', 'wondering', 'how', 'many', 'show', 'full-length', 'renditions', 'say', 'plenty', 'joy', 'soul', 'what', 'here', 'everyone', 'collection', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'beginning', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'including', 'pieces', 'dud', ""n't"", 'remember', 'found', 'set', 'include', 'great', 'episodes', 'Bon', 'Jour', 'Sondra', 'Kight', 'Night', 'One', 'More', 'Time', 'grew', 'up', 'show', 'pilot', 'first', 'aired', 'when', 'was', 'four', 'whole', 'family', 'watched', 'show', 'right', 'finale', 'Season', '8', 'Dr.', 'Cosby', 'yes', 'doctor', 'education', 'proved', 'time', 'again', 'series', 'education', 'as', 'important', 'everyone', 'entertainment.Of', 'most', 'significance', 'here-and-now', '2008', 'hour-and-a-half', 'documentary', '2005', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Look', 'Back', 'Even', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'special', 'just', 'special', 'DVD', 'combined', 'memories', 'regular', 'series', 'kept', 'captivated', 'when', 'first', 'happend', 'copy', 'arrived', 'March', '11', '2008', 'watched', 'least', 'little', 'bit', 'day', 'eight', 'days', 'afterwards', 'wo', ""n't"", 'grow', 'old', 'anytime', 'soon.Also', 'musician', 'have', 'great', 'appreciation', 'series', 'score', 'including', 'neat', 'Stu', 'Gardner', 'saxophones', 'phase-shifted', 'Rhodes', 'piano', ""'ve"", 'got', 'real', 'interest', 'Jazz', 'largely', 'music', 'show', '[', 'One', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'series', 'run', 'how', 'much', 'Dr.', 'Huxtable', 'job', 'seemed', 'be', 'kind', 'sideshow', 'silly', 'characters', 'materialized', 'element', 'appeared', 'episodes', 'pilot', 'Rudy', 'Sick', 'Theo', 'Joint', 'Father', 'Day', 'Physician', 'Year', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'following', 'seasons', ']', 'Someday', ""'ll"", 'get', 'coveted', 'Columbia', 'House', 'set', 'now', ""'m"", 'sticking', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'know', 'full-length', 'cut', 'pilot', 'example', 'Dr.', 'Cosby', 'macho', 'breathing', 'taken', 'much', 'pilot', 'material', 'HBO', 'special', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Himself']",N/A

Great for family laughs! We cut the cord on cable and now view TV though our DVD collection or watch though Netflix on our Roku. We just grew tired of paying for paid TV with nothing good to watch.We read a review saying how this show used to be on Netflix and was for some reason taking off of Netflix, don't know why... But it is okay for us as we like to take our DVD's with us while on the road as it makes for some fun times. This has also come in handy when we are out and have to wait for long periods of time.. This happen recently and The Cosby Show saved the day! We started season one and before we knew it, it was time to go on to our next destination.So back to the reason we went ahead and purchased this collection. Due to the garbage on T.V. these days, looks like many people are looking for great T.V. shows and are turning to shows like this again. Many people are tired of paying for trash T.V. so they have found other ways to view T.V. the way they want to. Looks like this is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many like the Cosby show so it is in demand! (I even have the Cosby Show set as one of my ring tones on my cell phone)!While shopping on Amazon we selected the used copy we wanted and while still shopping someone else purchased the copy we had in our cart so we lost that copy and had to select another copy that cost more. I guess that goes to show how great this show is, everyone is grabbing copies of it.(demand for this show is good)(which is good, because this should show producers that people really want to watch).Anyway, our family loves this show and glad that we were still able to find a used copy for a decent price.. We don't want to spend too much money out of our budget. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV. We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo etc.. Any way, if you want clean T.V. this is it!I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the shows that we want like The Cosby show since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this T.V. series is available on Amazon.This T.V. Series teaches a lot of great lessons and also entertains you.. Miss those days of shows like this. So if you are looking for clean great family fun, this show is for you.. You will not be disappointed. Our children love this show! This show could even go for parental education!Bill Cosby is great and we are thankful to enjoy such talent! We wish that the Fatherhood cartoon would be released on DVD. Two seasons on Nick Nite (2004-2005 season run time and has been canceled). and twenty six episodes.. This was a great cartoon with values, please release this on DVD..Happy viewing! And if you are looking for more funny shows, don't for get The PJ's with Eddie Murphy, Martin show, My wife and Kids, Jamie Foxx, and What's happening!

There are many fun times to be had in this first season, like Cliff giving Theo an economics lesson with Monopoly money, Vanessa sounding awful on the clarinet, and Theo getting mad when he finds a joint in his geography book.  All the episodes are funny, and the extras are a pleasure to watch.  The discs are packaged really well, and the set even comes with an essay on the show.  The bad news is that these shows are edited.  They are the same as what you can see for free on TBS and Nick at Nite.  I was very hesitant to buy this set because of that, but I'm glad I did anyway.

Like millions of other families, every Thursday night when this came on, my family and I would get around the TV and watch it.Why is ""The Cosby Show"" so groundbreaking?It is really the first accurate depiction of an African-American family. Prior to ""The Cosby Show,"" African-American sitcoms always had the buffoon character with unrealistic storylines. But ""The Cosby Show"" refused to pander to the lowest common denominator. And by doing so they became the Number One Sitcom in the country. ""The Cosby Show"" said that the black family was no different from the white family or the Asian-American family or the Latin-American family. Maybe the main message of ""The Cosby Show"" was that in the end we all have the same problems and the same goals.It's really hard to say who my favorite character is on ""The Cosby Show."" The entire cast is so likeable. Watching them was like watching old friends. If I had to pick, of course first would be Dr. Huxtable (played by the Cos, of course.) Because even when the kids did something wrong he was fair but very funny. And, coming in at a close second is Denise (Lilakoi Moon, more commonly known as Lisa Bonet.) Denise was always such a free spirit. And, of course I adored Mrs. Huxtable (Phylicia Rashd.)

896862,A25TQX39TVXJJO,B0007ZSHR6,"JM Strange Tales ""JM""","[17, 28]","1. Pilot First aired: 9/20/1984 Denise's DateClair is furious when Theo brings home a report card with 4 D's. He tells Cliff that he has no intention of going to college, as he feels that he is destined to be a ""regular person."" Cliff uses Monopoly money to teach him about the economic realities that many blue-collar workers must face. He assures Theo that he only wants him to try his best. Cliff is alarmed to meet Denise's latest beau, a former merchant marine who once spent time in a Turkish prison.2. Mr. Fish (a.k.a. Goodbye, Mr. Fish) First aired: 9/27/1984Rudy becomes very sad after her pet goldfish, Lamont, dies. Cliff accuses the rest of the family of being insensitive to her plight, and forces everyone to get dressed up and attend a funeral for Lamont in the bathroom. The event ends abruptly after Rudy becomes bored and decides to leave to watch television.3. Bad Dreams First aired: 10/4/1984Vanessa is upset when she is not allowed to see a new action movie with Clair and Theo. She has a long history of being unable to handle scary movies. She goes against her father's wishes and sees the movie anyway, thanks to a high school student who buys tickets to R-rated movies for younger kids. She experiences nightmares and insists on sleeping in her parents' bedroom for several nights. Clair finally coaxes her back to her room by giving her a ""bravery medal"" that has supposedly been handed down by several generations of women in their family. Cliff is less than pleased to discover that Clair actually gave away his track medal. Denise gets back at a date who ignores her by ordering the most expensive items on the menu.4. Is That My Boy? First aired: 10/11/1984Cliff is overjoyed when Theo makes the freshman football team. He annoys Clair by constantly talking about his glory days and predicting that his son will follow in his footsteps. Cliff works out with him and discovers that he has a well-choreographed end zone celebration dance, but no skill whatsoever. Clair pleads with Cliff not to show his disappointment. Theo admits that he does not expect much playing time, but his parents agree to support him. Cliff gives Rudy permission to play in his and Clair's room to stop her from interrupting Vanessa's studying, but forgets about her. A distraught Rudy hides in a large box in the back yard. She feels that she is worthless because of her age, but Clair manages to cheer her up.5. A Shirt Story First aired: 10/18/1984Theo uses Cliff's credit card to buy a 95-dollar Gordon Gartrelle designer shirt, which he plans to wear on a date. Cliff feels that this is too expensive and insists on returning it. Denise agrees, and claims that she can make Theo an identical shirt for much less money. Cliff and Clair are highly skeptical, as Denise has a tendency to abandon projects. Denise does manage to finish the shirt, but it turns out to be a complete mess. A furious Theo fears that he will be humiliated. Cliff reveals that he kept the other shirt in anticipation of such a problem. However, Theo's date and friends see him in the shirt that Denise designed and rave about its originality. He decides to wear the shirt on his date.6. Breaking With Tradition First aired: 10/25/1984Cliff's father drops by for a visit. Theo takes the exhausted Cliff's order to keep away all visitors a bit too seriously and refuses to allow Russell into the house. A perplexed Cliff manages to straighten out the situation. Russell is pleased by Sondra's performance at Princeton, but desperately wants to see one of his grandchildren continue a family tradition by attending Hillman College. Denise has no real interest in Hillman, but Cliff convinces her to listen to Russell's sales pitch. She seems to change her mind after learning that there are eight men for every woman on campus. Cliff reveals that he only selected Hillman because he wanted to follow Clair to school. He refuses to allow anyone to share this with Clair, as he wants to save the information for a time when he is really in trouble.7. One More Time First aired: 11/1/1984After babysitting for a friend, Clair becomes obsessed with the idea of having another child. The kids are terrified at the implications this would have on them, and Cliff isn't too thrilled either. Clair's mother visits and suggests that she simply wait a few years for grandchildren. Theo beats Cliff at basketball for the first time. This prompts Cliff to warn Clair that they are too old to keep up with another child. He wants them to be able to spend time together and travel after their retirement. Clair tells him that she had already come to her senses.8. Play It Again, Vanessa First aired: 11/8/1984Discouraged by her lack of ability, Vanessa decides to give up the clarinet. She does not want to take part in an upcoming recital because she is afraid of embarrassing herself. Cliff refuses to let her quit yet, as she has made a commitment to the recital. He enlists the help of the music teacher, Mr. Hampton, to give her extra lessons. Vanessa and the other students improve enough that the audience can almost tell what song they are playing.9. How Ugly Is He? First aired: 11/15/1984Vanessa tells Cliff that Denise has been purposely keeping her boyfriends away from him because she feels that he is rude to them. He is the only member of the family who has yet to meet her latest boyfriend David, an intelligent young man who writes poetry. Cliff promises to behave himself, and convinces Denise to invite David over for dinner. David initially impresses Cliff by bringing him a jazz record, but soon begins to get on his nerves. He infuriates Cliff with his comments about the medical profession. Although Clair claims that she enjoys the discussion, she changes her mind after David not only puts down lawyers, but opines that Clair should stay home with the kids. Denise whisks David away for his own protection. She seems poised to dump him after he makes additional sexist comments during their date.10. Bon Jour Sondra First aired: 11/22/1984Sondra comes home for Thanksgiving and reveals plans to spend the summer with some friends in Paris. Clair feels that it is a wonderful idea, and gives Sondra some pointers on winning over Cliff. When Cliff hestitates to give his approval, Clair calls a family meeting. All of the children vote in Sondra's favor. Cliff takes her aside and explains that he is worried about Paris's reputation, as he fears she will party too much. He eventually agrees to let her go. Theo anxiously awaits the opportunity to carve the family's Thanksgiving turkey for the first time. Cliff has him practice on a chicken and a cabbage so that he can acquire the proper technique. He tries to blackmail Theo into siding with him against Sondra by threatening to revoke his carving privileges, but lets him do it anyway.11. You're Not a Mother Night First aired: 12/6/1984Clair becomes fed up with the pressures of her job and the constant demands of the children. Cliff decrees that evening to be ""You're Not a Mother Night."" He takes her out to dinner and rents a room at the Biltmore for the night, leaving Denise to look after the other kids. Theo handles a call from a patient very well and gives her the number of another doctor. As a joke, the kids call up their parents' hotel room and warn them not to have another baby.12. Rudy's Sick First aired: 12/13/1984Clair prepares for an interview with her firm's senior partner, which will determine whether she makes partner. She wants to bring in a babysitter to look after the ailing Rudy, but Cliff insists that he can handle things. Mr. Halifax, the man interviewing Clair, rambles on endlessly. The interview goes on for so long that Cliff has to move Rudy down to the living room so that she will be closer to his basement office as he goes into work. He tries to help a father-to-be who faints at the mere mention of his wife's labor. Clair finally walks out on the interview after Mr. Halifax falls asleep, but later learns that she has made partner.13. Father's Day First aired: 12/20/1984Clair notices that Cliff is still wearing his worn-out old pajamas and wonders why he doesn't wear the ones she gave him for Father's Day. This sets Cliff off on a speech about how no one gives fathers what they really want or need for Father's Day. He digs out a box of gifts the children have given him over the years, and shows off an array of ties, belts and hats that light up. He walks around the house in the tacky clothing and asks the children to put some thought into their gifts the next time Father's Day comes around. The kids agree that they haven't been thoughtful, and set out with Clair to buy him some better Father's Day presents--even though it is two weeks until Christmas. Meanwhile, Cliff encounters a macho father-to-be who insists that he is the boss of the household and must always get his way. Cliff sets him straight, explaining that he and his wife must band together to keep the children from taking over.14. Independence Day First aired: 1/10/1985Theo reveals to Denise that he got his ear pierced, courtesy of a friend's younger sister. He claims that the earring is a symbol of independence, but he is actually trying to impress a girl. Denise notes that his ear is infected, and urges him to seek help from Cliff. He refuses, but Denise drops a hint to her parents so that Cliff will discover the truth. Cliff treats Theo's problem and decides to punish him by turning him over to his visiting grandfather, who is very conservative. However, Russell proves to be surprisingly understanding. He shares that a teenage Cliff once tried to impress Clair by straightening his hair, only to burn off all his hair. Cliff's mother chimes in with a story about Russell. He decided to have her name tattooed on his chest, but was suffering from a cold at the time. The artist misunderstood him and tattooed the name of Anna's chief rival, Adda. Anna forced Russell to have the tattoo removed, leaving him with a permanent scar. Russell, Cliff and Theo bond over their antics.15. Physician of the Year First aired: 1/17/1985Cliff prepares to receive the Physician of the Year award. The entire family gets dressed up, and Cliff teaches Theo how to shave for the occasion. Just as the Huxtables are about to leave, Cliff receives a phone call from a woman who has gone into labor. As she is a first-time mother, he decides to go to the hospital to reassure her, rather than sending a substitute. The woman turns out to be much closer to delivery than Cliff had anticipated, and he must miss the ceremony. He has Theo read his speech and accept the award on his behalf.16. Jitterbug Break First aired: 1/31/1985Cliff and Clair make plans to go dancing with some friends. Clair admits that Cliff's dancing embarrasses her. Denise tries to convince her parents to let her sleep on the street in the hopes of getting tickets to a concert. Cliff refuses to consider this. Denise's friends come over and admit that their parents also turned them down. However, an acquaintance has agreed to stand in line and buy tickets for everyone. The teens decide to hang out at the Huxtable house instead. They move the furniture so that everyone can dance in the living room. Theo shows off his breakdancing skills. When Cliff and Clair's friends arrive, the adults take to the floor and compare moves with the kids.17. Theo and the Joint First aired: 2/7/1985Clair accidentally knocks one of Theo's books off the kitchen table and discovers a joint. Clair initially jumps to the conclusion that Theo is a drug addict and that all of his friends are dangerous criminals. Cliff tries to calm her down. They confront Theo, who adamantly declares that the joint is not his and that he has never done drugs. Cliff and Clair insist that they believe him, but Theo is furious that he was subjected to accusations because of someone else's actions. He discovers that the joint belongs to classmate Anthony Braxton, who shoved it into the book to hide it from a teacher. Theo is prepared to fight the much larger Braxton to convince him to come to the Huxtable house and confess. He tells Cliff the truth and agrees to consider counseling. Cliff assures Theo that he did not need to put himself in danger, as he did believe his denial. Braxton seems impressed by the level of trust between father and son, and joins the other neighborhood kids in their touch football game. Meanwhile, gossip Vanessa annoys Cliff and Theo with her constant pathetic attempts to pry information about Theo's situation.18. Vanessa's New Class First aired: 2/14/1985Vanessa prepares for the science fair. She believes that her project is very good, but Denise warns that she may need to work harder to keep up with the kids in her new advanced class. Vanessa is shocked by the quality of the other kids' projects, and begins to feel embarrassed. She finishes 14th in the competition, and alienates best friend Janet by accusing her of getting help from her parents. Vanessa assures Cliff that she is capable of succeeding in the class, but needs to put in more of an effort. Clair tries to keep the status of the broken dishwasher a secret from Cliff. As usual, he insists on trying to repair the appliance himself. His efforts prove so disastrous that he has to replace the machine altogether. He unsuccessfully tries to hide the truth from Clair.19. Clair's Case First aired: 2/21/1985Sondra sues an auto mechanic after he charges her for services that he did not perform. Clair becomes angry when her colleague tries to settle the case, and insists on taking over. Cliff asks the children to take over the household chores as Clair spends all of her time preparing for the trial. The family must also endure Cliff's cooking, which seems delicious until he reveals the ingredients. Clair grills the mechanic on the stand and proves that he billed Sondra for a new engine when he had actually repaired the original engine. Cliff leaves a courtroom spectator bewildered by pretending that he and Clair are strangers and approaching her for a date during the recess.20. Back to the Track, Jack First aired: 2/28/1985Cliff's college track coach recruits him to join the members of his old mile relay team for a grudge match against the Norton University team, who handed Cliff the only defeat of his career. Cliff made up a twenty-yard deficit on his anchor leg, but Norton's Tailwind Turner bumped him across the track and kept him from passing. Cliff struggles in his training and concludes that he cannot get in shape in time for the race. He changes his mind after Turner calls him up and taunts him. Cliff gets the baton with the lead, and gets revenge on Tailwind by bumping him to prevent him from passing. The race ends in a tie. An exhausted Cliff enjoys the praise of his family, but wonders if he'll ever be able to move again.21. The Younger Woman First aired: 3/14/1985Cliff and Clair invite a widower friend and his girlfriend over to the house. They are very surprised to discover that Mike's girlfriend is young enough to be his daughter. However, they are very impressed with the young woman, and realize that the couple is quite compatible and seems to be very much in love. They conclude that age really shouldn't make a difference in a relationship. Clair continually torments Cliff by asking him questions about whether he would ever re-marry or date if he were a widower. She inflicts bodily harm upon him whenever he gives the wrong answer.22.

I am a loyal fan of the show and have all the ORIGINAL episodes on VHS. I didn't even make it past the 1st show when I realized I was ripped off. And it's not just a few seconds, it is entire scenes that are cut out. One scene that I was looking forward to seeing betewwn Cliff and Claire in the 1st episode was completely gone.The DVD will be returned tomorrow and I recommend that no one buy this junk!  I thought I would share with you the 1 response I got from these people ""We truly appreciate your enthusiasm regarding the Season One DVD release of THE COSBY SHOW, one of Carsey-Werner's most cherished projects.  We sympathize with your concerns relating to the syndicated episode versions.To provide some background for you, THE COSBY SHOW SEASON ONE DVD would not be a reality had the network versions of the show been used.  The licensing fees for the music cues often add up to exorbitant dollar amounts thereby prohibiting the release.  You will find that other studios and distribution companies exercise the same practice of using syndicated versions of a show, which include revised music cues.Please be assured that the edits made to the show were done with the utmost of care and concern by the original producers.  These changes were limited to transitions and in most cases did not include dialogue and/or important moments.  Every precaution was made to ensure that the integrity of the show was not in any way compromised.It should be noted that due to the passionate response we have received from collectors, we are seriously pursuing the possibility of using the network versions on ALL future releases.Thank you for your concern and feedback.Carsey-Werner Distributionc/o The DuVernay AgencyWell that's sweet, but it doesn't change the fact that they falsely advertised their product and fool us into buying it. At least the producers of ""Roswell"" had the decency to tell us that they put new music in the DVD episodes and included with the DVD was a letter from the producers explaining. I did contact the head of the company I bought it from and she agreed to give me a gift certificate for the amount I paid for this FRAUD.

896873,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B0007ZSHR6,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[13, 17]","The Jeffersons"" (1975) introduced America to an African American family who was moving on up, but that series had also reminded America that George and ""Wheezy"" were poor at one point.In contrast, this series was revolutionary because a solidly affluent African American family was shown. Clair Huxtable (Phylicia Rashad) is a lawyer and her husband Cliff (Bill Cosby) is an OB/GYN. They live in a very nice New York City brownstone with their four children. Denise (Lisa Bonet) briefly would be spun off into the equally successful ""A Different World"".Cliff and Clair have obviously made it in the world, they are still trying to get their children to take responsibility. Cliff's biggest worry is that his children will not be as successful. Twenty four episodes of the 1984-1985 first season show both parents providing guidance to their children about life. They love all of those children very much, but also insist on order.In the 'pilot' Cliff teaches son Theo (Malcom-Jamal Warner) about the economic realities of a blue collar job with Monopoly money. A job which would have been totally 'respectable' in the Jeffersons and other sitcom familes is upsetting to the Huxtables. Clair and Cliff want their own kids to continue enjoying the wealth which they have grown up around and recognize that a blue collar job will not be able to provide those luxuries.I also liked ""Breaking with tradition"" because it suggested that even the Huxtables are not perfect. Grandfather Russell Huxtable (Earle Hyman) comes for a visit while his own son is exhausted, and soon all kinds of personal family secrets become divulged. Grandfather would like Sondra (another one of the kids, played by Sabrina Le Beouf) to attend his alma mater, Hilman, because it is a historically black college which had educated many other family members. Meanwhile, Cliff reveals that he had only selected Hilman because Clair was there---and forbids this information from being disclosed to Clair.""Independence day"" reveals Theo has gotten an infection after an un-sterile do-it-yourself ear piercing. Theo finally goes to his father for much-needed medical help, but is made to tell his 'conservative' grandfather what he has done under the idea this will prevent future mishaps. Once again, Grandpa Huxtable saves the day because he instead tells Theo that Cliff had once burned off his hair while attempting to straighten it in order to be more appealing to the 'mainstream' white society'. Grandma Anna (Clarice Taylor) also tells the story of how her husband accidentally got the name of her rival tattooed on his chest---instead of her name.",5,TV's First Solidy Upscale African American Family,1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,2622,"['Jeffersons', '1975', 'introduced', 'America', 'African', 'American', 'family', 'who', 'was', 'moving', 'series', 'had', 'also', 'reminded', 'America', 'George', 'Wheezy', 'were', 'poor', 'one', 'point.In', 'contrast', 'series', 'was', 'revolutionary', 'solidly', 'affluent', 'African', 'American', 'family', 'was', 'shown', 'Clair', 'Huxtable', 'Phylicia', 'Rashad', 'lawyer', 'husband', 'Cliff', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'OB/GYN', 'live', 'very', 'nice', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'brownstone', 'four', 'children', 'Denise', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'briefly', 'would', 'be', 'spun', 'off', 'equally', 'successful', 'A', 'Different', 'World', '.Cliff', 'Clair', 'have', 'obviously', 'made', 'world', 'are', 'still', 'trying', 'get', 'children', 'take', 'responsibility', 'Cliff', 'biggest', 'worry', 'children', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'successful', 'Twenty', 'four', 'episodes', '1984-1985', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'parents', 'providing', 'guidance', 'children', 'life', 'love', 'children', 'very', 'much', 'also', 'insist', ""'pilot"", 'Cliff', 'teaches', 'son', 'Theo', 'Malcom-Jamal', 'Warner', 'economic', 'realities', 'blue', 'collar', 'job', 'Monopoly', 'money', 'A', 'job', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'totally', ""'respectable"", 'Jeffersons', 'other', 'sitcom', 'familes', 'upsetting', 'Huxtables', 'Clair', 'Cliff', 'want', 'own', 'kids', 'continue', 'enjoying', 'wealth', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'recognize', 'blue', 'collar', 'job', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'provide', 'luxuries.I', 'also', 'liked', 'Breaking', 'tradition', 'suggested', 'even', 'Huxtables', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'Grandfather', 'Russell', 'Huxtable', 'Earle', 'Hyman', 'visit', 'own', 'son', 'exhausted', 'soon', 'kinds', 'personal', 'family', 'become', 'divulged', 'Grandfather', 'would', 'like', 'Sondra', 'one', 'kids', 'played', 'Sabrina', 'Le', 'Beouf', 'attend', 'alma', 'mater', 'Hilman', 'historically', 'black', 'college', 'had', 'educated', 'many', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'Meanwhile', 'Cliff', 'had', 'only', 'selected', 'Hilman', 'Clair', 'was', '-and', 'information', 'being', 'disclosed', 'Clair', 'Independence', 'day', 'reveals', 'Theo', 'gotten', 'infection', 'un-sterile', 'do-it-yourself', 'ear', 'piercing', 'Theo', 'finally', 'father', 'much-needed', 'medical', 'help', 'made', 'tell', ""'conservative"", 'grandfather', 'what', 'done', 'idea', 'will', 'prevent', 'future', 'mishaps', 'Once', 'again', 'Grandpa', 'Huxtable', 'day', 'instead', 'Theo', 'Cliff', 'had', 'once', 'burned', 'off', 'hair', 'attempting', 'straighten', 'order', 'be', 'more', 'appealing', ""'mainstream"", 'white', 'society', 'Grandma', 'Anna', 'Clarice', 'Taylor', 'also', 'story', 'how', 'husband', 'accidentally', 'got', 'name', 'rival', 'tattooed', 'chest', '-instead', 'name']",N/A

You'd see kids scurry away from new Barbie dolls, Heman, and Transformers. You'd see children suddenly act right when this show came on. There were positive African American shows around like 227, Amen, and others, but nothing even remotely compared to the rich culture and comedy of this show.  When the eighth season ended, I felt so empty inside like ""What am I going to do now?""  But then I smiled because my mother taped every single episode, so I just went through the tapes and rewatched everything from scratch.  Even now, I still stop to watch the show on syndication. When I found out that the DVDs were coming out, I was bumrushing the Internet to get all four copies available.  Just as I knew I would, I loved watching this season.  I laughed so hard my side hurt at the episode when Bill Cosby talked about how much his Father's Day gifts sucked.  When he turned out the lights and things started lighting up, tears fell out of my eyes.  Classic, wholesome entertainment.  Even in a two-parent household with an older brother and a dog, I still wanted to be a part of the Cosby family too.  Some young men looked at Cosby as a father figure because they didn't have one; I looked at him as a cool play dad for myself and all of his family as my own play family.  There was not one episode of this entire show that I didn't enjoy. I appreciated how they introduced Black art, music, and culture without lecturing; how the family was positive without being corny; alert without being obnoxious; and how it lacked the melodrama that television has today.

The first season of The Cosby Show starred Bill Cosby as Dr. Heathcliff ""Cliff"" Huxtable, Phylicia Ayers-Allen as Clair Huxtable, Lisa Bonet as Denise Huxtable, Malcolm-Jamal Warner as Theodore ""Theo"" Huxtable, Tempestt Bledsoe as Vanessa Huxtable, and Keshia Knight-Pulliam as Rudy Huxtable. Season 1 focused on doctor Cliff Huxtable and his attorney wife, Clair, raising their five (four in the first episode) children in Brooklyn. The children consisted of stylish, popular 16 year-old Denise, who seemingly had a different boyfriend every week and was very rebellious, 13 year-old (14 later in the season) lazy, only son Theo, nosy 10 year-old (11 later in the season) Vanessa, and the youngest, precocious, adorable little 5-year-old Rudy. In season one, the Huxtables dealt with a daughter dating an older man, a son struggling in school, a child crushed over the loss of a favorite pet and more. Later on the season in the episode ""Bonjour Sondra,"" we were introduced to a fifth Huxtable child, 20 year-old oldest Sondra (played by Sabrina LeBeauf), who's off at Princeton. There were other characters this season, including Russell and Anna Huxtable (played by Earle Hyman and Clarice Taylor), Cliff's loving parents, and Peter (played by Peter Costa), Rudy's silent but lovable friend, known for running out of the house in times of trouble. The Huxtables went through many things, all while making the viewers laugh. On August 2, 2005, the Huxtables came to DVD for the first time with the Urban Works release of The Cosby Show Season 1, which included all 24 episodes of the first season and ""The Cosby Show: A Look-Back,"" a 2002 special where the cast memebers of the series look. However, there was one problem, Urban Works released the first season with the episodes in their edited syndicated format instead of they way the were originally broadcast on NBC. Fans were understandably outraged, but fortunately, Urban Works corrected this with their 2006 release of The Cosby Show Season 2, which contained uncut episodes. Urban Works Entertainment was eventually taken over by First Look Studios, who took the distribution of The Cosby Show DVD releases and released the remaining six seasons in the span of a year, along with The Cosby Show 25th Anniversary Commemorative Edition, a complete series with new special features, including a 2-part interview with Bill Cosby, a 1990 bloopers special, and a digital photo gallery including pictures from all eight seasons of the series. Plus with the complete series release, Season 1 was uncut. However the set soon went out of print due to manufacturing errors. In 2011, Millennium Entertainment re-released the The Cosby Show Season 1 uncut with the original look-back special and with the special features from the out-of-print complete series set and that is the set I'm doing my review on. The menus are great. You get the option of playing them all or choosing the episodes individually. When you choose them individually, you can choose the acts. You get the options of Opening, Act I, Act II or Closing. Not only does this set contain uncut episodes and the look-back special, but it contains New Interview with Bill Cosby, a digital photo gallery, and ""Outtakes From The Cosby Show,"" a 1990 blooper special. The 2-part interview is something nice as it shows Bill Cosby talking about the show, how it happened, how he felt about it, his favorite and least favorite things about the show and more. The photo gallery is great. It shows nice pictures of the cast as the kids grow up throughout the series. The Look-Back Special is wonderful. It shows 2002 retrospectives with cast members, who include Bill Cosby (Cliff), Phylicia Rashad (Clair), Sabrina LeBeauf (Sondra), Malcolm-Jamal Warner (Theo), Tempestt Bledsoe (Vanessa), Keshia Knight Pulliam (Rudy), Raven Symone (Olivia), Geoffrey Owens (Elvin), Deon Richmond (Kenny/Bud), Peter Costa (Peter), and Earle Hyman and Clarice Taylor (Grandma and Grandpa Huxtable). Noticeably absent was Lisa Bonet, who played Denise. The 1990 blooper special is hosted by Phylicia Rashad, Lisa Bonet, Malcolm-Jamal Warner, Tempestt Bledsoe, Keshia Knight Pulliam, and Raven-Symone and shows hilarious bloopers. Bill Cosby is hilarious. It's the set to buy, but you have to be careful when buying and you have to make that the copyright says 2011, because if it says 2005, you get the edited version and it only shows the Look-Back Special. The packaging is one of those Digipak cardboard foldout cases. There are quotes from Bill (Cliff) Cosby on the packaging. This set has 4 discs (but be careful with them, because they overlap), there's a character on each disc. Disc 1 contains episodes 1-8 and has Bill Cosby as Cliff Huxtable. Disc 2 contains episodes 9-16 and has Keshia Knight-Pulliam as Rudy Huxtable. Disc 3 contains episodes 17-24 and has Tempestt Bledsoe as Vanessa Huxtable. Disc 4 contains the bonus material (including ""A Look-Back"" special) and has Phylicia Rashad as Clair Huxtable. Here is a list of the episodes on the set:Disc 1Pilot Presentation *Goodbye, Mr. FishBad Dreams * (episodes with * next to them are my favorites)You're Not a Mother Night (aka) Knight to NightIs That My Boy?Breaking with TraditionOne More TimeA Shirt Story *Disc 2Play It Again, Vanessa *How Ugly Is He? *Bonjour SondraFather's Day *Rudy's SickIndependence Day *Physician of the YearJitterbug Break *Disc 3Theo and the Joint *Vanessa's New ClassClair's CaseBack to the Track, Jack *The Youngest WomanThe Slumber Party *Mr. QuietCliff's Birthday *Disc 4Bonus Material:New Interview with Dr. Bill Cosby Part 1New Interview with Dr. Bill Cosby Part 2Digital Photo GalleryShow BloopersThe Cosby Show: A Look-BackI recommend this DVD to anyone of literally all ages.
