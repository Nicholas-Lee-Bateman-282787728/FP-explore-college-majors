1262805,AIO247KHD2O40,B002CMGO5O,James N Simpson,"[1, 1]","This is quite an enjoyable to watch movie, even though it covers a dark time in history that tells the story of Irena Sendler's actions in Warsaw during German occupation which saved countless children by smuggling them out of the Warsaw Ghetto and into unofficial foster families before they were to be loaded onto freight trains and a probable death in the concentration camps. The cameras follow Anna Paquin for the majority of footage and she does a great job of portraying the Polish hero as do the other actors in the minor roles.  Shot in an historic Latvian town, the setting looks pretty authentic to old photos of Polish towns in that era, as do the vehicles and clothing. If I was being critical I'd say the clothing especially in the ghettos was a bit clean and new looking but this was a made for TV movie after all. If you're prepared to read a good movie, a similar story in another Polish townIn Darknesshas Polish actors telling the tale of a sewer worker who saved a group of Jews by hiding them in the sewers. It gets more into the venturing through the putrid sewers and living there and that sort of experience from the Jewish people's point of view than A Courageous Heart does which concentrates more on Irena. Both are good films, just concentrating on different perspectives.The DVD version (sold in Australia anyway you might want to check) comes with a pretty interesting documentary on making the film and teaching the fake made up accent to Anna (who's a New Zealander) and all the other actors.

1262806,A3Q04XXGGED746,B002CMGO5O,"Jan Peczkis ""Scholar and Thinker""","[20, 21]","Based on my long-term studies of the Holocaust, I conclude that this movie depiction of Irena Sendler is close to the actual historical events. WARNING: Some of the scenes in the movie are emotionally intense, and may be upsetting to sensitive viewers.German propaganda had attempted to convince the Poles that the Jews were being locked up in ghettos in order to protect the Polish population from the typhus borne by Jews. For a long time, Jews had thought of the Germans as a very civilized people, for whom mass extermination of peoples would have been unthinkable. Warsaw's Jews deluded themselves into thinking that Warsaw's nearly 500,000-strong Jewish community was too large to be harmed by the Nazis. Then, for a long time, too many Jews had accepted the Germans' ""resettlement"" claims at face value.Irena's Sendler's offer of help was not all that well received. Many Jewish leaders thought that, since Jews had survived persecutions before, they could do so again, and do it without aid from the Poles. Furthermore, many Jewish parents did not want their children raised by Poles, if only out of the fear that they would, through deliberate acts or passive influences, convert to Christianity. Some Jews thought that the risk of their children converting to Christianity was equivalent in outcome to the risk of dying, while other Jews disagreed with this notion. Then of course it was difficult for parents to voluntarily part with children in the hope that they would survive the war.Successfully placing Jewish children in Polish homes was very difficult because the Jewish children had to be smuggled out of the ghetto. In addition, Jews did not fit into Polish society. Poland's Jews mostly spoke Yiddish and had a weak understanding of Polish, if that. Poles faced the death penalty for the slightest aid to Jews. In spite of all this, Irena Sendler managed to save 2,500 Jewish children before falling into the hands of the Gestapo. She was repeatedly tortured, and then only a well-placed bribe by the Polish Underground, directed at a corrupt German individual, snatched her in the last minute from the jaws of the executioners.[It is not true, as asserted by one reviewer, that Polish nationalists (Endeks, the followers of Roman Dmowski) opposed helping Jews. In fact, the one-of-a-kind ZEGOTA aid organization, of which Irena Sendler was a member, contained Poles of all political persuasions, including the Endeks. Members of even the more extreme nationalist ONR also were involved in helping Jews, whether or not they personally had changed their prewar anti-Jewish positions.]",5,The Heroism of the Pole Irena Sendler Shown With Good Historical Accuracy,1285372800,"09 25, 2010",2010,2604,"['Based', 'long-term', 'studies', 'Holocaust', 'conclude', 'movie', 'depiction', 'Irena', 'Sendler', 'close', 'actual', 'historical', 'events', 'WARNING', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'may', 'be', 'upsetting', 'sensitive', 'viewers.German', 'propaganda', 'had', 'attempted', 'convince', 'Poles', 'Jews', 'were', 'being', 'locked', 'up', 'ghettos', 'order', 'protect', 'Polish', 'population', 'typhus', 'borne', 'Jews', 'long', 'time', 'Jews', 'had', 'thought', 'Germans', 'very', 'civilized', 'people', 'whom', 'mass', 'extermination', 'peoples', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unthinkable', 'Warsaw', 'Jews', 'deluded', 'thinking', 'Warsaw', 'nearly', '500,000-strong', 'Jewish', 'community', 'was', 'too', 'large', 'be', 'harmed', 'Nazis', 'Then', 'long', 'time', 'too', 'many', 'Jews', 'had', 'accepted', 'Germans', 'resettlement', 'claims', 'face', 'value.Irena', 'Sendler', 'offer', 'help', 'was', 'not', 'that', 'well', 'received', 'Many', 'Jewish', 'leaders', 'thought', 'Jews', 'had', 'survived', 'persecutions', 'could', 'do', 'so', 'again', 'do', 'aid', 'Poles', 'Furthermore', 'many', 'Jewish', 'parents', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'children', 'raised', 'Poles', 'only', 'fear', 'would', 'deliberate', 'acts', 'passive', 'influences', 'convert', 'Christianity', 'Jews', 'thought', 'risk', 'children', 'converting', 'Christianity', 'was', 'equivalent', 'outcome', 'risk', 'dying', 'other', 'Jews', 'disagreed', 'notion', 'Then', 'course', 'was', 'difficult', 'parents', 'voluntarily', 'part', 'children', 'hope', 'would', 'survive', 'war.Successfully', 'placing', 'Jewish', 'children', 'Polish', 'homes', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'Jewish', 'children', 'had', 'be', 'smuggled', 'ghetto', 'addition', 'Jews', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'Polish', 'society', 'Poland', 'Jews', 'mostly', 'spoke', 'Yiddish', 'had', 'weak', 'understanding', 'Polish', 'Poles', 'faced', 'death', 'penalty', 'slightest', 'aid', 'Jews', 'spite', 'Irena', 'Sendler', 'managed', 'save', '2,500', 'Jewish', 'children', 'falling', 'hands', 'Gestapo', 'was', 'repeatedly', 'tortured', 'then', 'only', 'well-placed', 'bribe', 'Polish', 'Underground', 'directed', 'corrupt', 'German', 'individual', 'snatched', 'last', 'minute', 'jaws', 'executioners', '[', 'not', 'true', 'asserted', 'one', 'reviewer', 'Polish', 'nationalists', 'Endeks', 'followers', 'Roman', 'Dmowski', 'opposed', 'helping', 'Jews', 'fact', 'one-of-a-kind', 'ZEGOTA', 'aid', 'organization', 'Irena', 'Sendler', 'was', 'member', 'contained', 'Poles', 'political', 'persuasions', 'including', 'Endeks', 'Members', 'even', 'more', 'extreme', 'nationalist', 'ONR', 'also', 'were', 'involved', 'helping', 'Jews', 'not', 'personally', 'had', 'changed', 'prewar', 'anti-Jewish', 'positions', ']']",Hallmark The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler Hall of Fame War

1262827,ACM90BRKX73OG,B002CMGO5O,Tom,"[52, 60]","Hallmark's ""The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler,"" which first aired on CBS on April 19, 2009, does a good job presenting the story of Irena Sendler and Zegota. Very few people are aware of the Council to Aid Jews (code name: Zegota), the Polish underground organization which assisted Jews during the Nazi occupation. It's estimated Zegota saved 4,000 Jews, mainly in the Warsaw area. Irena Sendler (Sendlerowa), the focus of this film, headed the organization's children's section and was responsible for saving the lives of 2,500 Jewish children.Not all Polish Catholics were interested in assisting Jews. Anti-Semitism was pervasive in Poland prior to the war and continued into the occupation. One of the four political parties which comprised the Polish underground Delegatura, the National Party representing conservative Catholics, refused to support Zegota in any way. It was only until the spring of 1944, when it was already too late, that the Polish Government-in-exile began supporting Zegota with any seriousness. Despite lack of funding and support, the brave and selfless individuals who comprised Zegota carried on with their mission in the face of tremendous danger to their own personal safety.Anna Pacquin gives a gritty performance as the determined Sendler, although she does seem to play only one note throughout. While this movie was shot in Latvia, Polish film buffs will recognize a number of Polish actors in the cast including the incomparable Danuta Stenka. To its credit, the film does touch upon the anti-Semitic attitudes of some Poles. This is a Hallmark, made-for-television movie so don't expect the large budget accouterments of a theatrical release. That being said, ""The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler"" is both entertaining and informative. A five-star-film? No. But a worthwhile effort.

During World War Two, this selfless, generous woman rescued countless Jewish children from certain death by smuggling them out of the Warsaw Ghetto in Poland and finding them safe homes with Polish families and also convents and orphanages.Irena is credibly portrayed by Anna Paquin who shines in her role as the devout and determined social worker/ administrator at a hospital who by virtue of her position is able to enter the Warsaw Ghetto and administer medical services. When Irena witnesses the terrible suffering of the Jewish people trapped in the ghetto, she decides to do all she can to at least save the children, the innocents who were frequently targeted for immediate extermination upon arrival at the death camps like Auschwitz.Knowing full well that the punishment for helping Jews escape is almost certain death, Irena, together with the help of several loyal colleagues and those working in the Polish Underground manage to save at least 2,500 Jewish children. The number may seem staggering and even unbelievable to some, but bear in mind that the Warsaw Ghetto at capacity had around 400,000 residents crammed into it by the Nazis so 2,500 Jewish children is only a drop in the ocean compared to the vast numbers transported to their deaths. However, the fact that Irena and like-minded people risked their lives to save these children is an incredible feat in itself.The scenes where Irena is given the children by desperate parents are harrowing, and I could only imagine how those parents must have felt like, knowing that giving up their children may be the only way to ensure their survival. There are many heart-stopping moments in this film, and even gruesome torture scenes, but these things really happened, during a dark time when evil manifested itself in the form of the Third Reich. Highly recommended for those interested in the Holocaust.Note: This is a Region 2 DVD and will only play on a multi-region player.",5,"A credibly-portrayed made for TV production on a Righteous Gentile, Irena Sendler",1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,2061,"['story', 'Irena', 'Sendler', 'amazing', 'one', 'well-deserving', 'term', 'Righteous', 'Gentile', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'selfless', 'generous', 'woman', 'rescued', 'countless', 'Jewish', 'children', 'certain', 'death', 'smuggling', 'Warsaw', 'Ghetto', 'Poland', 'finding', 'safe', 'homes', 'Polish', 'families', 'also', 'convents', 'orphanages.Irena', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'who', 'role', 'devout', 'determined', 'social', 'worker/', 'administrator', 'hospital', 'who', 'virtue', 'position', 'able', 'enter', 'Warsaw', 'Ghetto', 'administer', 'medical', 'services', 'When', 'Irena', 'terrible', 'suffering', 'Jewish', 'people', 'trapped', 'ghetto', 'do', 'can', 'least', 'save', 'children', 'innocents', 'who', 'were', 'frequently', 'targeted', 'immediate', 'extermination', 'arrival', 'death', 'camps', 'Auschwitz.Knowing', 'full', 'well', 'punishment', 'helping', 'Jews', 'escape', 'almost', 'certain', 'death', 'Irena', 'together', 'help', 'several', 'loyal', 'colleagues', 'working', 'Polish', 'Underground', 'manage', 'save', 'least', '2,500', 'Jewish', 'children', 'number', 'may', 'seem', 'staggering', 'even', 'unbelievable', 'bear', 'mind', 'Warsaw', 'Ghetto', 'capacity', 'had', '400,000', 'residents', 'crammed', 'Nazis', 'so', '2,500', 'Jewish', 'children', 'only', 'drop', 'ocean', 'compared', 'vast', 'numbers', 'transported', 'deaths', 'However', 'fact', 'Irena', 'like-minded', 'people', 'risked', 'lives', 'save', 'children', 'incredible', 'feat', 'itself.The', 'scenes', 'where', 'Irena', 'given', 'children', 'desperate', 'parents', 'are', 'harrowing', 'could', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'parents', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'knowing', 'giving', 'up', 'children', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'way', 'ensure', 'survival', 'are', 'many', 'heart-stopping', 'moments', 'film', 'even', 'gruesome', 'torture', 'scenes', 'things', 'really', 'happened', 'dark', 'time', 'when', 'evil', 'manifested', 'form', 'Third', 'Reich', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'interested', 'Holocaust.Note', 'Region', '2', 'DVD', 'will', 'only', 'play', 'multi-region', 'player']",Hallmark The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler Hall of Fame War
