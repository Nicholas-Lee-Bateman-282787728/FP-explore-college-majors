1530957,A37021SSH9LGY6,B007HRKBM6,Barbara J. Wertz,"[10, 10]","VCI seems to be on a roll lately, releasing several excellent DVDs of films that aren't great masterpieces but are still welcome additions to one's film library.  The picture quality is great.  The sound track is a little tinny, but that's characteristic of British films of this era.  Subtitles are offered.The story is based on the autobiography of Marthe McKenna, which was a best seller in its day.  The screenplay is realistic and brings out the emotional conflicts of all the characters.  War is not a matter of black and white, but a lot of screenplays treat it that way.  The cast, headed by Madeleine Carroll, Conrad Veidt and Herbert Marshall is excellent and there are strong supporting performances by the usual British character actors.  Victor Saville's direction really shines in the scenes of masses of troops, but he handles the more intimate scenes well too, and manages to create a sense of claustrophobia where appropriate.  There are several of those camera zooms characteristic of early talkies that were necessary to keep the sound of the camera from being recorded on the soundtrack but which look a bit odd to modern audiences.  Don't mistake them for poor cinematography.  They were a technological necessity in their day.Based on this one, I can hardly wait to watch the rest of VCI's new releases.",5,Welcome release of long-neglected film,1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,1325,"['VCI', 'be', 'roll', 'lately', 'releasing', 'several', 'excellent', 'DVDs', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'masterpieces', 'are', 'still', 'welcome', 'additions', 'one', 'film', 'library', 'picture', 'quality', 'great', 'sound', 'track', 'little', 'tinny', 'characteristic', 'British', 'films', 'era', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'offered.The', 'story', 'based', 'autobiography', 'Marthe', 'McKenna', 'was', 'best', 'seller', 'day', 'screenplay', 'realistic', 'out', 'emotional', 'conflicts', 'characters', 'War', 'not', 'matter', 'black', 'white', 'lot', 'screenplays', 'treat', 'way', 'cast', 'headed', 'Madeleine', 'Carroll', 'Conrad', 'Veidt', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'excellent', 'are', 'strong', 'supporting', 'performances', 'usual', 'British', 'character', 'actors', 'Victor', 'Saville', 'direction', 'really', 'scenes', 'masses', 'troops', 'more', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'well', 'too', 'manages', 'create', 'sense', 'claustrophobia', 'where', 'appropriate', 'are', 'several', 'camera', 'characteristic', 'early', 'talkies', 'were', 'necessary', 'keep', 'sound', 'camera', 'being', 'recorded', 'soundtrack', 'look', 'bit', 'odd', 'modern', 'audiences', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mistake', 'poor', 'cinematography', 'were', 'technological', 'necessity', 'day.Based', 'one', 'can', 'hardly', 'wait', 'watch', 'rest', 'VCI', 'new', 'releases']",I Was A Spy

Conrad Veidt, being German born, always played the German commander and all his performances are excellent.  Madeline Carrol finds herself drawn into the war as a nurse and further implicated to serve as a spy.  What she discovers later is Herbert Marshall her co worker also is a spy and ultimately becomes the love of her life.  Not a long movie, but entertaining.

It's a Rank production and it's an English film of the thirties for two more.

1530966,A2E330I8TKW4C1,B007HRKBM6,WSH,"[8, 8]","I concur with the other reviews giving this 5 stars. The title of the film might deter some prospective viewers - it is, after all, pretty cheesy - but don't be deceived by the label. Victor Saville has directed a film with high production values, a well-constructed script and an excellent cast. The outdoor scenes in the German-occupied Belgian town, where the story is set, are reminiscent of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" in their grand choreography and attention to detail. Indeed, the final scenes of ""I Was A Spy"" include a mis-en-scene effect much admired in that other film. It is easy to understand why Madeleine Carroll was a great star in her day. Not only is she strikingly beautiful in black and white, her range of emotions and fluidity of movement lend great vitality and interest to the character she plays.The film has been somewhat restored, though it is not perfect in either vision or sound. These defects, however, do not count for so much because the look and intrinsic interest of the film itself outweigh the preservation shortcomings. We can only be glad that a film of this quality, made in 1933, has made it to a new generation.",5,"An effective, intriging film",1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,1159,"['concur', 'other', 'reviews', 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'title', 'film', 'might', 'deter', 'prospective', 'viewers', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'deceived', 'label', 'Victor', 'Saville', 'directed', 'film', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'well-constructed', 'script', 'excellent', 'cast', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'German-occupied', 'Belgian', 'town', 'where', 'story', 'set', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'grand', 'choreography', 'attention', 'detail', 'Indeed', 'final', 'scenes', 'Was', 'Spy', 'include', 'mis-en-scene', 'effect', 'much', 'admired', 'other', 'film', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'Madeleine', 'Carroll', 'was', 'great', 'star', 'day', 'Not', 'only', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'black', 'white', 'range', 'emotions', 'fluidity', 'movement', 'lend', 'great', 'vitality', 'interest', 'character', 'film', 'been', 'somewhat', 'restored', 'not', 'perfect', 'vision', 'sound', 'defects', 'however', 'do', 'not', 'count', 'so', 'much', 'look', 'intrinsic', 'interest', 'film', 'outweigh', 'preservation', 'shortcomings', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'glad', 'film', 'quality', 'made', '1933', 'made', 'new', 'generation']",I Was A Spy
