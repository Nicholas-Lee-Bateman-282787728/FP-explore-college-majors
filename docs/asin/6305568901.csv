For someone who is a fan of the horror genre (me), this movie is a guilty pleasure. Now the ""found-footage"" genre is getting worn out (although I love it), but ""Blair Witch"" is original and is one of the most innovative movies of all time. The first time I saw it, I wasn't really scared, but when it was nighttime I was kinda creeped out. To truly be creeped out or scared by this movie, you have to place yourself in the character's shoes, you can't just sit back and watch the movie expecting to be scared. You have to kind of work your head around it all. You might watch the first 2 nights and think ""That's not scary"", but just pretend you're actually out there hearing footsteps in the woods at nighttime from 15-20 feet away. It's pretty creepy. There's a lot of the film that contains them fighting a lot, and yelling at each other, but it's also sad to watch all that happens to them. If you're bored during the first couple nights, Night 5 is when it's really thrilling, because outside of their tent they hear children laughing and a baby crying. A short moment afterwars, there's a violent pounding on the tent so they run out of it screaming. That's one of my favorite parts. Another one is, obviously, the apology scene (You see it on the cover on the bottom when it shows half her face). I think that's an emotional and disturbing scene from the movie. It's another one of my favorites, and it should have won an Oscar, but instead it won a Razzie. My third favorite part from the film was the ending. It's very freaky and you'll be thinking about it hours after you see it, but there's foreshadowing in the beginning that happens in the ending, so to get the end, you have to see the beginning. Another good scene is when they see all the stick figures. This film is brilliantly executed and it's one of my favorite horror movies of all time.",5,Very creepy and classic movie!,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,1950,"['anyone', 'who', 'big', 'fan', 'horror', ""'m"", 'sure', 'know', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'someone', 'who', 'fan', 'horror', 'genre', 'movie', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Now', 'found-footage', 'genre', 'getting', 'worn', 'out', 'love', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'original', 'one', 'most', 'innovative', 'movies', 'time', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'scared', 'when', 'was', 'nighttime', 'was', 'kinda', 'creeped', 'out', 'truly', 'be', 'creeped', 'out', 'scared', 'movie', 'have', 'place', 'character', 'shoes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'movie', 'expecting', 'be', 'scared', 'have', 'kind', 'work', 'head', 'might', 'watch', 'first', '2', 'nights', 'think', 'not', 'scary', 'just', 'pretend', ""'re"", 'actually', 'there', 'hearing', 'footsteps', 'woods', 'nighttime', '15-20', 'feet', 'away', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'lot', 'film', 'fighting', 'lot', 'yelling', 'other', 'also', 'sad', 'watch', ""'re"", 'bored', 'first', 'couple', 'nights', 'Night', '5', 'when', 'really', 'thrilling', 'tent', 'hear', 'children', 'laughing', 'baby', 'crying', 'short', 'moment', 'afterwars', 'violent', 'pounding', 'tent', 'run', 'screaming', 'one', 'favorite', 'parts', 'one', 'obviously', 'apology', 'scene', 'see', 'cover', 'bottom', 'when', 'half', 'face', 'think', 'emotional', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'movie', 'one', 'favorites', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'instead', 'won', 'Razzie', 'third', 'favorite', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'ending', 'very', 'freaky', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thinking', 'hours', 'see', 'foreshadowing', 'beginning', 'ending', 'so', 'get', 'end', 'have', 'see', 'beginning', 'good', 'scene', 'when', 'see', 'stick', 'figures', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'executed', 'one', 'favorite', 'horror', 'movies', 'time']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS
469263,A1YSDK1ZEVMT7U,6305568901,Aaron M.,"[4, 4]","This is a film comes with some baggage: the whole ""true story"" marketing campaign and the insinuation that the events unfolding were not just a film recreation, but actual found footage. The same thing that helped make it a smash hit was probably to blame for the backlash against it. People probably felt duped and there is little else that makes people angrier than feeling like a fool. Other films have used this technique; The Coen Bros Fargo or Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, neither of which were later hated for the use of it, though neither of those films tried to present their movie as actual footage either.I didn't get to have the experience of thinking it was real; I had heard about it months before the release from other horror fans on the internet who were already blasting as a rip off of The Last Broadcast and Cannibal Holocaust before they had even seen it. I didn't have high hopes for it.I did see it several times in the theater though, with several different groups of people. Initially I was reluctant but by the time I saw it near the end of its run, at a matinee where only myself and one friend were the total audience, I was a very willing viewer.Some people complained about the shaky camera. It never bothered me. Most people I went with were True Believers. They just knew it was a true story and the footage was real, no matter how much I tried to convince them otherwise. I'm not sure if they were truly fooled or fooled themselves because they wanted it to be true. I'm not sure which is more disturbing: the film, or the people that wanted to believe these three people in the film were actually dead. Personally I would have been much less interested in seeing a snuff film. I wouldn't have gone to see that.I can't understand anyone who was angry at the fact that what they had thought was three dead people cringing in terror during the final days of their lives, turned out to be fiction. Seriously, you don't think these kids families would have had something to say about their children deaths being turned in a money-making entertainment? Come on.But enough of all that, what about the film? For me it's a great nod to films like The Haunting (1963) and the school of horror where the implied is king and your imagination does the job on you. I'm not going to argue with those who hate implied horror or think its cheap. I'm also not going to accuse them of having no imagination. Everyone has their own taste. Whatever.But I would even include such films as the Exorcist and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre within the sphere of implied horror. For every shock the Exorcist throws at you, it offers another subtle implied threat. One you have to think about to fully experience. With Chainsaw it's the fact that very little blood or gore is shown, the film lets your imagination do most of the heavy lifting.Unlike those two films though, Blair Witch does not even share time with more direct horror. It wants to be a mind fueled shadow play through and through, and I applaud it for having the courage to do so...and for me, it works.Its three main characters are distinct, fleshed out, and most importantly sympathetic. The best horror asks you to empathize with its characters. The characters here are not cardboard cut-outs that the filmmakers can brutalize for the pleasure of the crowd. Some people didn't like Heather, but I saw her more ""objectionable"" behavior as a coping mechanism, hiding behind her camera and insulting the other characters at times as an understandable attempt to keep the fear underneath at bay.A lot of their acting is subtle and not shoved into your face. In a normal movie this would not be the case. Character moments would be underscored with music and typical film language which would lead the viewer into what to think. Blair Witch is not interested in leading you by the nose in such a way. They respect their audience enough to allow them to think for themselves.These characters do bicker a lot, especially as the stress of their situation begins to take its toll. Their situation strips away the faade of civilization. It's not heroic or romantic. It's what happens to real people. Not that it's all pessimism. Once acceptance has come, it allows for truth to come out in a way it rarely does (Heather's confession), and towards the end Mike shows courage as he single-mindedly seeks to find their missing comrade. The best horror lifts the faade of the false goodness of the ""civilized"" person (with its conditional nature of doing for others only as a means to gain for oneself) and shows humanity's base selfish, frightened animal side. But perhaps buried under that can be found true goodness, or at least some authenticity.The filmmakers present a rich back story in a short period of time. They pull this trick off by sprinkling bits of information throughout the film from various sources of uncertain dependability. They leave you to fill in the blanks, simulating how such legends grow and spread in the real world. They offer many possible sources for the events in the film, never truly settling on any definitive answer. Observant viewers will notice the tales relevance to the story as it unfolds. (the seven missing children from the Justin Parr story coinciding with the characters finding seven piles of rock cairns in the cemetery later on, for instance)Despite the supernatural overtones in the film, there are no definitive supernatural events. Nothing that could not be explained away rationally. Even their returning back the their point of origin after walking for an entire day could be explained away by a faulty compass and the very real phenomenon of human beings tendency to walk in circles when lost.Unlike most films, we can't explain anything away through hallucinations. The nature of the film being that everything is being picked up on camera, we are not allowed the luxury of that. So, something is definitely out there. Something that sounds like small children playing at times. A bit hard to explain that one away, unless there really is a cult living out there in the woods. Could be. Could be ghosts. Could be human agents. Could be the Blair Witch. It largely lets you fill in your own answer, which serves those of the more supernatural bent and those that favor a more rationale answer. Some people don't like question marks in their films, so I guess it loses out with that crowd but otherwise it's great the way the filmmakers have managed to allow the film to have its cake and eat it too.",5,A welcome throwback to the era of intelligent realism in horror.,1320969600,"11 11, 2011",2011,6525,"['film', 'baggage', 'whole', 'true', 'story', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'insinuation',

They called the fact that the director's used a minimal script, horrible equipment, and good actors wasted on improvisational lines that my little brother could write, creative. Boy were they wrong. The only enjoyable aspect of it all is the ending, which is bone chilling, other than that expect two hours of pointless drivel. Is this a study on how people and isolation, as well as fear, can not interact? By no means, there are better films that explore psychology than this gargantuan heap of flies. Is this a horror film? It is not a horror film, neither standard or cliched or of any sort, not even a gore flick, which could at least make us enjoy some aspect of it. It has no intelligence, contrary to the critics belief, its just some kids lost in the woods find out that a legend is true...haven't i heard this before? The filmmakers force you through more than an hour of three people goin' around in circles lost in the woods and encountering things that would only scare the most gullible of folks. It is until the last five, count them, five minutes that you can enjoy this flick or feel horrified to the least denominator.Other than that await seemingly endless film sludge. In fact i found it so dull that i actually thought the peripheral material like the fake documentaries found within the dvd,or on video, about the blair witch to be more terrifying than this massive mistake. The film itself though is pig slop. This is not innovative or genius it is just silly and boring. Trust me i've sst through some boring stuff in my entire life and i have seen films that move, innovate, inspire, terrify, and much more, but this is just the drivel of a 6 year old with a camera and a few friends, and not even good drivel. Ed Wood did a better job with Plan 9 From Outer Space. At least we expected manure from him.However three stars are deserved for the ending, which proved to be the most terrifying (in a good way) thing in the film.  It showed a lot of potential.  One or two scenes in between the beginning and the end also show plenty of potential and are actually watchable.  However the scenes in the woods fail to communicate any suspense or worry for these &quot;lost&quot; travelers. Instead they just make you sit through meaningless drek.  They fail to make these characters believable, like i'm sure they were supposed to do. In other words, while this film was supposed to look realistic it looks staged, very staged.The dvd features also contribute to the final three star judgement. As previously mentioned the documentaries piqued my interest and perked up my interest in the film.

469266,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,6305568901,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[1, 1]","When The Blair Witch Project was released in 1999, it was met with raving critical reviews, but was trashed by moviegoers aplenty who complained of boredom and stupidity. Despite the mixed response, its impact on horror films cannot be denied and it spawned a wave of cam corder films (Best imitators: Open Water and REC) and showed us the power of independent film-makers and how they can outdo Hollywood vets when they put their heart into a film. Is this film overhyped? In some ways, yes it is. But I certainly don't think this is a bad film. This is a horror film that taps into a primal fear and gets into your skin. It also leaves you with many questions (Which can be frustrating), but it also leaves a great deal of intrigue and it is a rather fascinating film.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: October 1994. Three friends: Heather, Mike, and Josh are all setting out to make a documentary about a legend about the Blair Witch by interviewing people in a town and then eventually trekking into the woods to see if they can get anything on camera. However, after a period of time the trio gets lost and a night they hear strange noises and as each night goes by it gets worse. The group begins to run short on supplies, they're hungry, tired, and begin blaming each other for getting lost. Things begin escalating and the group gets more and more lost and learn all too quickly about what may be in store for them.MUSIC: There is none. That is the one thing I don't like about cam corder films, most of them don't have music.ACTING: These are easily among the most believable performances in horror history. These actors really do make you believe they are afraid and you can feel their tensions as things begin to degrade and go horribly wrong. Stunning and superb is how these performances should be characterized. Don't let young children watch this because the dialogue is loaded with F-bombs, but I have no gripes with the dialogue either.ACTION: If you hate slow films, then I suggest you don't watch this film. It intends to build suspense and makes you wait for what happens. While this film didn't particularly scare me, it was pretty creepy and atmospheric and it does this very well. This film isn't really violent either, it's mostly just about tapping into your fears through unanswered questions and ""what the hell was that?"" kind of moments. If you have patience and love horror flicks, then this is a must-have.

That girl was one whiny broad; I would like to give her a rap in the mouth.  PLOT: Three student filmmakers go looking for a witch who  kills kids (okay, what's the point?  Did they actually believe in the  witch?  If so, then why the hell?  If not, then why the hell?).  After a  little while, they start yelling f--- you at each other for 30 minutes.  They run out of food, yet their camera keeps running, because it's  obviously powered by a nuclear generator.  The camera is aimed at the  ground for most of the film.  This is because the Blair Witch is actually a  squirrel. After yelling f--- at each other for awhile, the three get tired  and decide to walk some more.  Oh, yeah, if they would've actually shut up  and walked for 10 minutes, they would have found a Total station just down  the road.  So our heroes trek on, casually using profanity for no apparent  reason.  One guy dies.  He yells for awhile, and the other two simply yell  back, &quot;Sean?  Where the f--- hell are you, you little  motherf---er?&quot;  Or something like that.  Then it gets dark again (it  does that a lot; usually there's a bird fluttering against the tent which  makes our heroes mess themselves).

As the film begins the creepiness starts to build, but once the three teens start to flip out and begin to scream at each other that's when comedy begins.  For one thing one character actually admits to throwing the only map they have in the river.  Why in the heck would someone do that?  I know when I'm somewhere I not too familiar with the last thing I do is throw away my map.Granted I can understand how the characters would loose it while being lost in the woods. Plus having unusual wicker/stick sculptures left in their camp would be a bit freaky.  However, it seemed to me like a cult of the so-called Blair Witch and not the spirit of the witch herself were terrorizing the teens.  I'm not sure if that was the director's attempt or not but it seemed like it to me.  Despite the fact that the film was shot on such a low budget the cinematography was decent.  The woods always make a good setting for horror films, because lets be honest anyone who is in the woods especially at night can get a little disoriented and nervous.This film however didn't frighten me much at all. I think mainly because the first time I saw it I already knew that the film was not real footage but with actors.

469284,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,6305568901,Amanda,"[0, 5]","I first heard of 'The Blair Witch' project long before it came out. I had read an article about it in Entertainment Weekly, and I said to myself, ""I HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE."" Why? Because it sounded original; like nothing else that had ever been done before. I knew, of course, that the ""footage"" wasn't real, but I hear some people actually believed the whole thing was a true story. For those people, I'm sure 'Blair Witch' freaked them out. As for me, well it freaked me out too. At the time.Now, I hang my head in what I guess should be considered shame. 'Blair Witch' was graced with the same exact curse as 'Titanic': a movie that became so big, so popular, that it suddenly, for inexplicable reasons becomes uncool to like. I don't know why this is really. But now, it is embarassing to admit it. But I will anyway. I was a 'Blair Witch' freak. After seeing the film, I ran out and bought the book, and taped the fake documentary off the Sci-Fi Channel. I wanted to see it again and again. I absolutely loved it.I still really like it. I mean, even if you absolutely hate it, and say it wasn't at all scary, you have to admit one thing: this is one of the most original films ever. The whole movie is shot with two different hand-held cameras, by the actors themselves. Most of the dialogue you hear spoken by the 3 characters was actually ad-libbed (in fact, I think I read that there was actually no script for the movie, and that it was all up to the actors). Heather, Josh and Mike (which are the actors' real names and the characters' names) all did a great job, considering the conditions they were under (camping out in the cold, damp woods, filming themselves making up a script as they went along). And the Blair Witch herself? Well we never actually see her. That's the creepiest part about it. Is there really a Blair Witch haunting the woods, looking for some more people to kill? Or are all of the noises they hear at night just in the characters' imaginations? Hmm. We may never find out, really.'Blair Witch' spawned many, many parodies (amongst my favorites, the 'Wizard of Oz' one) which were well-deserved. Maybe it is actually a parody itself. Who knows. A lot of people thought it was boring, and maybe now I can see where they were coming from. But you have to give credit where credit is due. Thanks to filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, I will think twice before entering the woods.

There were really only 3 characters in the whole movie, and the set was just the woods.  In fact, we never even saw the Blair Witch or any special effects at all.  If all movies were like this, it would get boring real fast, but because they're not, this is a one-of-a- kinder.  It is also impressive how resourceful the movie was, on such a tiny budget yet making so much money in the theaters.I kept waiting to see the witch face to face and what she would do to the kids.  But it is what we can't see that is the scariest.  The three get lost in the woods just when someone seems to be messing with their minds at night.  It gets scarier and one of them disappears in the night without a trace, all his things left behind.  They later hear him screaming in the night but don't find him until they discover an old beat up abandoned house.  Just then, they seem to disappear or drop dead or something, because we were viewing what they were viewing through the cameras they had rolling, which dropped to the floor.  Abrupt, yet good, and definitely scary ending.  So what is the Blair Witch, anyway?

469293,A326TH21VE2NPY,6305568901,Andrew Kotwicki,"[0, 1]","After careful observation, I have come to the conclusion that &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; is the best film of the year!  It was the most original, most brilliant, and most frightening.  They also made history  with the now-famous &quot;apology&quot; scene.  What sickens me is the  accumulation of negative criticism this film took from morons who are only  scared by special effects and gore.  People who didn't like this movie need  to go to proctologists and find their heads!  What in the hell is there not  to like?  I loved every minute of this film!  Every frame was a work of  art!  I am also proud to say that the dizzy camerawork did not make me ill,  as many people have said.  Plus it was kept simple, and was more down to  earth than most of today's escapist, hollywood horror films(or should I  say, horror film wanabees).  The other thing that shows how moronic the  people who didn't like this film really are, is that people thought it was  real, and then hated it when they found out it wasn't.  I knew that it was  fake(meaning created by directors with actors) the first minute I heard  about it, and yet I didn't seem to care.  Just because it's meant to feel  real, doesn't mean it is real!  They say people who watch movies know the  difference between fantasy and reality.  &quot;The Blair Witch  Project&quot; proved that statement wrong.  And last but not least, was the  fact that people who hated it said it wasn't scary at all.  How stupid!  This film will scare you to the point where you heart is pounding so hard,  it's liable to explode from your chest!  It's not like those movies who try  to scare you by making you jump out of your seats.  It's a realistic,  gradual buildup of fear that reaches a peak of pure terror that never  resolves itself.  When I say this is the best film of the year, I don't  mean it's an Oscar caliber picture.  The Academy Awards don't nominate  films like that.  A less worthy film like &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is  more likely to have a shot at an award.  At first I was really upset by  what people said about how &quot;bad&quot; this film was, but now I don't  care anymore.  &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; is an incredible film,  shown to a world where idiots buy the tickets.  In terms of the  quality of the tape, it's great.  Film aficianados need not worry about  finding a letterboxed edition of this film, because it wasn't shot in  widescreen.  It also includes all three of the trailers, and newly  discovered footage(actually a deleted scene).  It's definitely worth the  price, and even if you don't buy videos, buy this one!  It's well worth  every good, hard earned American penny!  Hopefully, they(Artisan  Entertainment) will have the good sense to release &quot;The Blair Witch  Project&quot; in a box set, with loads of extras.

469294,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,6305568901,Andrew McCaffrey,"[1, 4]","Judging by the critical response to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, it appears that this is a film that is virtually impossible to feel ambivalent towards.  People seem to either love it or hate it, and to express their view with a fiery passion and a complete lack of understanding about how the other half could possible hold the opposite opinion to themselves.  Well, I place myself firmly in the ""loved it"" camp.  Actually, to be more specific, I place myself firmly in the ""absolutely scared stiff by it"" camp.  Twice I have watched this movie.  Both times I did so at night and with the lights off.  Both times I allowed myself to become completely drawn into the fantasy.  And both times I was utterly freaked out by the end of it.The plot of this film is too widely known and too skimpy for a summary to do any good.  Everyone knows that the movie consists of three young people going into the woods to make a documentary about a local witch.  Lots of potential newcomers probably know how the film will end before they even sit down.  But the success of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT lies in its execution rather than its foundations.  The fear and terror striking these young people comes across as completely believable.I was completely absorbed at all times by this film.  The characters are flawed people, and occasionally annoying, which might turn off some viewers, but to me it made them that much more realistic.  These people slowly realizing the predicament that they're in and becoming more and more freaked out by the strange and supernatural-tinged events is what made this movie work for me.I don't think there is any way of knowing how any individual will react to this film, but if the reviews are any guide, the reaction will be a strong one.  To anyone who hasn't seen this, I'd recommend going in with an open-mind and not allowing oneself to be distracted by any real-world occurrences.  If you do end up on the ""love it"" side of the fence, then you may just find yourself with a new favorite horror film.  If you end up on the ""hate it"" side, well, it's a short film (less than an hour and a half), so you didn't waste all that much time, and at least now you'll know what everyone was talking about.",5,Consider Me Terrified,1048377600,"03 23, 2003",2003,2217,"['Judging', 'critical', 'response', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'film', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'feel', 'ambivalent', 'towards', 'People', 'seem', 'love', 'hate', 'express', 'view', 'fiery', 'passion', 'complete', 'lack', 'understanding', 'how', 'other', 'half', 'could', 'possible', 'hold', 'opposite', 'opinion', 'Well', 'place', 'firmly', 'loved', 'camp', 'Actually', 'be', 'more', 'specific', 'place', 'firmly', 'absolutely', 'scared', 'stiff', 'camp', 'Twice', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'times', 'did', 'so', 'night', 'lights', 'off', 'times', 'allowed', 'become', 'completely', 'drawn', 'fantasy', 'times', 'was', 'utterly', 'freaked', 'out', 'end', 'it.The', 'plot', 'film', 'too', 'widely', 'known', 'too', 'skimpy', 'summary', 'do', 'good', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'three', 'young', 'people', 'going', 'woods', 'make', 'documentary', 'local', 'witch', 'Lots', 'potential', 'newcomers', 'probably', 'know', 'how', 'film', 'will', 'end', 'even', 'sit', 'down', 'success', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'execution', 'rather', 'foundations', 'fear', 'terror', 'striking', 'young', 'people', 'completely', 'believable.I', 'was', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'times', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'flawed', 'people', 'occasionally', 'annoying', 'might', 'turn', 'off', 'viewers', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'people', 'slowly', 'realizing', 'predicament', ""'re"", 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'freaked', 'out', 'strange', 'supernatural-tinged', 'events', 'what', 'made', 'movie', 'work', 'me.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'way', 'knowing', 'how', 'individual', 'will', 'react', 'film', 'reviews', 'are', 'guide', 'reaction', 'will', 'be', 'strong', 'one', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'going', 'open-mind', 'not', 'allowing', 'be', 'distracted', 'real-world', 'occurrences', 'do', 'end', 'up', 'love', 'side', 'fence', 'then', 'may', 'just', 'find', 'new', 'favorite', 'horror', 'film', 'end', 'up', 'hate', 'side', 'well', 'short', 'film', 'less', 'hour', 'half', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', 'much', 'time', 'least', 'now', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'everyone', 'was', 'talking']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

Actually, this movie breaks new ground on a number of fronts, one of which is to involve the cameraperson in the movie.  And so if the camera is off center or sideways or shaking or even dropped, you can tell how the cameraperson is feeling and since this is a horror movie, the point is to show how very very scared everyone is, especially the person who is holding the camera.Another effective aspect of the movie besides the way it was shot is the way it was cast.  The characters/victims are not professional actors/actresses giving canned responses.  They are again amateurs, and the way in which they talk and act in the movie is very realistic.  The audience can identify with them.Finally, the situation that arises in this movie, that of losing the map and getting lost in the woods, is a situation which almost anyone can relate to.  Even if you haven't actually gotten lost before, the fear or the momentary nudge that maybe you don't know where you're going, or that you can't trust the person who is leading the way or who is entrusted with the map is certainly a psychological dynamic which we are no doubt familiar with.And then there are those sounds and shadows in the middle of the night in the woods when you are camping out, which you can't quite identify but which look or sound eerily reminscent of something which you have seen or heard before . . . .",5,Where's the map??,1029110400,"08 12, 2002",2002,1554,"['movie', 'was', 'shot', 'amateurs', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'supposed', 'be', 'footage', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'amateurs', 'who', 'better', 'amateur', 'play', 'amateur', 'Actually', 'movie', 'new', 'ground', 'number', 'fronts', 'one', 'involve', 'cameraperson', 'movie', 'so', 'camera', 'off', 'center', 'sideways', 'shaking', 'even', 'dropped', 'can', 'tell', 'how', 'cameraperson', 'feeling', 'horror', 'movie', 'point', 'show', 'how', 'very', 'very', 'scared', 'everyone', 'especially', 'person', 'who', 'holding', 'camera.Another', 'effective', 'aspect', 'movie', 'way', 'was', 'shot', 'way', 'was', 'cast', 'characters/victims', 'are', 'not', 'professional', 'actors/actresses', 'giving', 'canned', 'responses', 'are', 'again', 'amateurs', 'way', 'talk', 'act', 'movie', 'very', 'realistic', 'audience', 'can', 'identify', 'them.Finally', 'situation', 'movie', 'losing', 'map', 'getting', 'lost', 'woods', 'situation', 'almost', 'anyone', 'can', 'relate', 'Even', 'have', ""n't"", 'actually', 'gotten', 'lost', 'before', 'fear', 'momentary', 'nudge', 'maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'person', 'who', 'leading', 'way', 'who', 'entrusted', 'map', 'certainly', 'psychological', 'dynamic', 'are', 'doubt', 'familiar', 'with.And', 'then', 'are', 'sounds', 'shadows', 'middle', 'night', 'woods', 'when', 'are', 'camping', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'identify', 'look', 'sound', 'eerily', 'reminscent', 'something', 'have', 'seen', 'heard']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS
469296,A13RYFCGR7AM7E,6305568901,"Andrew Thompson ""a.k.a. Jake Kincaid, Jack of...","[5, 8]","Let me start by saying that whilst I always try to keep my reviews spoiler free, in this case I may touch upon a couple of plot points that the six of you out there over the age of ten that haven't seen this might get something given away...so you are duly warned:)Onward...I really have trouble deducing why this little offering is so maligned...I mean, sure, it had some rough camera work and a couple of plot holes...even with that, it's somewhat (like a million light-years) above the standard low-budget horror film, and it had the audacity to have believable characters and a clever pre-release marketing campaign that alluded to the 'truth' of the story...How DARE they try to make us believe this is true and then turn out an almost devoid of blood or gore or even a glimpse of the 'monster' film?To my mind, genius.Having grown up in the southeastern United States, and having spent several years of my life in the military, I'm no stranger to being in the woods at night...from as far back as I can recall, my family has always camped (and by that I mean tents, backpacks, the ground as your bed and so forth...sleeping in an air-conditioned Winnebago with a 'fridge, microwave, toilet and a DVD player, while perhaps fun, is NOT camping, friends), hiked, and spent a LOT of time in forests.Given that, I can tell you in no uncertain terms that when the fire has ebbed to coals and the moon has made the branches above you into cobwebs of shadows, you hear some pretty freaky stuff...and I mean even if you HAVE spent a lot of time in the outdoors.This movie touched a nerve with me (and a lot of people I know) because it took us to a place in our own experiences where we wondered just what the hell was tramping around out there in the darkness while we sat vulnerable, far from help or home.  Add to that a well thought out, well-executed plan to get the theme of the film into our consciousness, and you have a recipe for just out-and-out terror that did not require big special effects, spurting blood, or hideous 'thing' in the woods to cause a considerable ""pucker-factor"".People complain about the camera work; yes, it's shaky...it's supposed to be amateur filmmakers...are there any of US out there who have impeccable camerawork in our OWN home videos?  In times of duress?Hmmm...don't see many hands....In my opinion (for what it's worth), I think the erratic movements added to the tension; we experience the frantic, panicked moments with the characters, building the dread and suspense.People complain about how the characters get so hopelessly lost...well, though it isn't implicitly expressed, I thought the impossibility of walking for hours and winding up in the same spot was the influence of the witch on their minds (which could also explain the whole ""map"" fiasco; although that is one point I DID find stupid) or their compass...I mean, if we're going to accept the concept at all, why not assume she can do that?  There ARE places on the earth you can go where compasses go haywire, and magnetic/geothermic undercurrents cause disorientation and confusion in humans...these woods are supposedly cursed and under supernatural sway, so I don't think that's too big a hurdle to jump.Lastly, a lot of people gripe that you don't actually 'see' anything...well, neither did the characters!  Just as with the 'hand-held' camera work, THIS is the beauty of it; we the viewers share/suffer the SAME experience, SAME terror, SAME despair that the characters themselves do. Let's be honest; if in the last ten minutes some haggard mannequin or CGI 'witch' had come bursting through the wall and eaten the camera, would that have REALLY been a better film?I honestly feel, as my title suggests, that expectations were too high, people figuring to see some James Cameron-ish take on the haunted woods story, and were left feeling cheated; in other cases, I think some people are just PO'ed that they bought into the 'truth' of this story and were so completely suckered...but regardless of either of these possibilities, I feel the film is very effective...very scary.My recommendation:  Turn off ALL the lights in your home...watch the ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" mockumentary (included) first, and really open your mind to the concept...THEN watch the film.If it doesn't creep you out, you're made of some pretty stern stuff indeed.",5,I think a lot of folks are hacked off that they got duped...but isn't that the beauty of a horror flick?,1286841600,"10 12,

They find more than they want, but they can't find there way back to civilization. Imagine what would happen if you were with two other people in the woods, lost and hungry. What would you do?The movie has too many ""F"" words in it that take you away from suspense. I found myself rolling my eyes during every argument and quite frankly, I found it boring. However, when ever suspense picks up, I found myself entertained and somewhat scared as if I was with them.The biggest problem is the hand held camera. It was too shaky and every once and awhile I had to look away from the screen because it was too nauseating. Because the camera was so shaky, we never actually see the Blair Witch or any other thing for that matter.So, why watch this film if there is just a bunch of screaming and cursing and shaking and no viewing of the Blair Witch? Because there are scenes that make your heart pound and the feeling of seclusion can make the viewer feel helpless.

When my friends invited me to the cinema I was skeptical: a movie shot on video? For 30 thousand? With just three rookie actors? C'mon...But when I watched it in theater (by the way one of the few films I saw in theater) I understood it deserved its credit, although I was not actually scared. But from that day on I was waiting till it comes out on video because I knew this kind of  movie is better watched home, alone, quietly, in the dark. And when I finally laid my hands on the DVD edition and watched it as I thought it had to be watched, it scared the crap out of me. ""Blair Witch Project"" is like a home-video and when you watch it in theater with crowds around you it loses its effect. But at home when you're in the dark alone its claustrophobia and unbearable suspence do their job. I recall some scenes when characters heard that laughter during the night or the final scene and they literally sent shivers down my spine and left me breathless. And video-camcorders deliver indeed! I never had such a strong feeling all that's happening is REAL. After such movies you begin thinking that maybe there's really something or somebody that dwells in remotest corners of our vast woods. For example, it's a well-known fact that we examined just about 20% of all oceans on Earth and we might just not know what lives in other 80%. The same thing about forests - who can tell for sure what's in there?Anyway if you saw ""Blair Witch Project"" in theater, bother to buy the DVD, because it's a whole different thing. A whole different feeling and a whole different scare.By the way it contains a very good documentary about the Blair Witch, and you really start wondering: and what if...",5,A FILM TO WATCH AT HOME,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,1841,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'already', 'hit', 'screens', 'knew', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'was', 'just', 'hype', 'When', 'friends', 'invited', 'cinema', 'was', 'skeptical', 'movie', 'shot', 'video', '30', 'thousand', 'just', 'three', 'rookie', 'actors', ""C'mon"", 'when', 'watched', 'theater', 'way', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'saw', 'theater', 'understood', 'deserved', 'credit', 'was', 'not', 'actually', 'scared', 'day', 'was', 'waiting', 'till', 'out', 'video', 'knew', 'kind', 'movie', 'better', 'watched', 'home', 'alone', 'quietly', 'dark', 'when', 'finally', 'laid', 'hands', 'DVD', 'edition', 'watched', 'thought', 'had', 'be', 'watched', 'scared', 'crap', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'home-video', 'when', 'watch', 'theater', 'crowds', 'effect', 'home', 'when', ""'re"", 'dark', 'alone', 'claustrophobia', 'unbearable', 'suspence', 'do', 'job', 'recall', 'scenes', 'when', 'characters', 'heard', 'laughter', 'night', 'final', 'scene', 'literally', 'sent', 'shivers', 'down', 'spine', 'left', 'breathless', 'video-camcorders', 'deliver', 'indeed', 'never', 'had', 'such', 'strong', 'feeling', 'happening', 'REAL', 'such', 'movies', 'begin', 'thinking', 'maybe', 'really', 'something', 'somebody', 'remotest', 'corners', 'vast', 'woods', 'example', 'well-known', 'fact', 'examined', 'just', 'about', '20', '%', 'oceans', 'Earth', 'might', 'just', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'other', '80', '%', 'same', 'thing', 'forests', 'who', 'can', 'tell', 'sure', 'what', 'there', 'Anyway', 'saw', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'theater', 'bother', 'buy', 'DVD', 'whole', 'different', 'thing', 'whole', 'different', 'feeling', 'whole', 'different', 'scare.By', 'way', 'very', 'good', 'documentary', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'really', 'start', 'wondering', 'what']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

You don't see many movies like that around, well maybe they're making more now, but it's not the same. For those who criticize this movie to the deaths, think about this. Wherelse have you heard of such a genious advertisement like this?: Three missing kids who took a trip in the woods for research with a tape left behind (and actually have movie posters and a website on the ""missing students"", a journal, photos, bits of clothing and leftover items from the students). Whoelse had their actors ad-libbing many lines in the movie? Whoelese had a ""document"" ont he Discover Channel about the Blair Witch to further advertise their film and to further make yourself question whether or not this whole situation is real or a hoax? Whoelse had thousands, maybe millions believing or questioning if this really happened?? Whoelse spent such a small amount to make a movie and ended up with millions in the end? The thing that I love about it is, all this was done by an independent film crew. It really shows that indie films have it's credit for being original and CREATIVE. Something that tends to lack in Hollywood today.I went to an Independent movie theatre to see it and I thought it was good seeing it in the theatres..very realistic and I thought the concept of ""less is more"" was a very good choice. This movie, as you rpobably might know is about three college kids on a venture in the words to find out more information about the Blair Witch to see if she was real or a hoax. Now, I don't scare easily, and I wasn't very scared but I do admit I was a bit creeped thinking about it. You have two main groups where some say they were scared as all h3ll and then you have the other group that say they weren't scared one bit. I was in neither really, but I think you should see which group you are in and watch it.

469304,A272G1285GP5QO,6305568901,Ary Luiz Dalazen Jr.,"[0, 0]","The Blair Witch Project scared people all around the world and brought a new type of horror to the screen: the fear of being lost, of being hunted down, practically dragging the entire audience in this relentless ride of  mounting tension. The basic idea is simple but original. Students decide to  make  a documentary about a haunted forest. Acording to the local's  inhabitants, there is something out into the woods. Heather, Josh and Mike  don't know what it is, but they are willing to discover. So they penetrate  into the woods with their cameras, and never return. Just their footage,  the images of their harrowing last days, is discovered.The first question  raised by the film's popularity is: why this low-budget, independent flick  turned out to be the year's most astonishing hit?what is so scary about it,  how can a movie that didn't cost more than twenty thousand dollars bring  primordial feelings like tension and distress closer to the audience?there  is just one answer: is what you don't see here that makes all the  difference. The Blair Witch Project is the kind of thriller that works  differently for each person in the audience, bringing your most primitive  fears to the top.You don't know what's going on, but by hearing the sounds,  by seeing some images, by hearing the scream and panic of the students you  can deduct that something very terrifying is happening, and that will put  you in touch with your most personal fear: of being lost, or maybe of being  buried alive, or being chased by a murderer or a maniac. The Blair Witch  Project is one of the most challenging movies I've ever seen, and it  deserves to be included among memorable masterpieces like The Exorcist and  Deliverance. Just one film, beyond The Blair Witch Project, made people  shake with the same intensity, Hellraiser, Clive Barker's  adaptation for  his own novel. There are two scenes that will always make me nervous:  Heather Donahue asking for forgiveness  in The Blair Witch Project, and a  woman holding a man inside her arms, kissing him and sucking his blood  through his mouth in Hellbound:Hellraiser 2.

There are many different answers here for many different people. There are certain things that just naturally generate fear. But the thing is, whatever is there scaring us might come from our own minds. Is something really there?. Is someone really in the dark corner in the basement?. Are we imagining it?. That's what this movie has really going for it. We have some noises and mysterious things in this film that help us, but mostly, the fear we get from this movie is what we think up in our heads. Nothing is really seen. It is what's not there, or what we don't see, that is the true terror of this film. The movie, shot in documentary style, is about three friends who head off into the woods with video camera to try and find the infamous Blair Witch. During their trip, they encounter ghostly happenings in the woods. Once our young campers are there, it only gets worse. Maps are lost, and the tension between the three rises. The movie can be highly annoying at times. The shaky camera will give anyone a migraine. The girl doesn't help matters any either. She is so loud and obnoxious you wished she would get it. The movie is scarier as an afterthought. Not necessarily while watching it. When it's over and you look back on it, it is  creepy. More so than when it's actually happening on screen. This brings us back to making it up ourselves. We aren't shown things and have no idea what exactly happened. We create it ourselves and that can be even more frightening than what is laid out before us up on the big screen. It does, however, have one hell of a classic ending tho. I do have to give credit to the filmmakers on this one. They should be respected for trying to do something a little different and risky. Five stars for that. This is a film that you either love it or hate it. There doesn't seem to be any halfway in that area.

I think one reviewer put it best ""the count of 'sesame street' is scarier."" And how true is that?Okay, I'll happily admit this: the acting is absolutely brilliant. Three actors were given all the equipment needed by the producers to film the movie and literally improvised the whole thing. I have to hand it to them: their acting skills are absolutely superb and by far exceed standards of movies budgeted at a mere $40,000. This being said, that was perhaps the only reason why I even bothered to give it three stars. The story on the other hand...I almost peed in my pants...laughing so hard.I'm going to be blantly honest. This movie did not scare me a bit. The producers relied mainly on shaky camera angles and good acting (which is often what most people do) in order to pull of this film. The plot, while somewhat realistic, showed that the creators had little...creativity. The story sounded something out of a pre-teen urban legend rather than a disturbing real-life news caption.The story centers on three college students who travel into the Virginia woods in order to further shed light on the Blair Witch Legend, while filming a documentary that highlighted their trip. After getting lost by some of the most extroadinarily stupidest circumstances (One of the travellers throws out the map just to further piss them off), our happy campers continually find themselves waking up every morning to the sight of stick dolls and strange rock formations assembled beside their tents (Oh my God, watch out! It's the attack of the stick dolls!).After continually losing it more than once (and losing one of the travellers), the final two approach a deserted house and find their supposedly fallen camper standing in the corner...until the lights go out.Like I said before, this movie isn't scary.

469317,A1OUEDUZ4AHVIZ,6305568901,"Ben Stubbs ""Horror / Metal Enthusiast""","[6, 8]","I really wanted to love ""The Blair Witch Project"" when I went to see it at the cinemas. I'd read the Internet hype after it came out in the U.S. back when not everyone realized it was fake. The reviews called it ""the scariest movie since the Exorcist!"" and stories of people screaming and crying in the cinemas really brought my expectations up to an unattainable height. I'd talked it up to myself as well as to friends and colleagues, telling them all that they had to go see it when it came out. But by the time it actually hit our shores (I'm an Aussie), everyone had been made aware that it was fake and all the magic of early reports had been replaced by negativity and mocking. But I lined up, paid my cash and went in to find out what it was all about.I must admit, that first sitting was the epitome of disappointment. The camera jumped all over the place and made me feel frustrated and a tad ill. The constant fighting of the characters got on my nerves more than a reality TV show. But the worst part of it was that I didn't find it at all to be scary. Here was this so-called holy grail of scary movies and people were actually laughing in the cinema rather than screaming. I walked out feeling completely let down after months of looking forward to the event.A couple of years later I decided to watch the movie on DVD. I picked a cold, dark night, turned all the lights out, took the phone off the hook and sat down on the couch. I'd made the decision that I was going to watch ""The Blair Witch Project"" the way the first viewers had seen it. Forgetting everything I'd ever heard about it, I would delve into it with a clean slate. I'm really glad I did! While I didn't completely freak out and lose my lunch in fear, I certainly found a new appreciation for it. In fact, if the viewer simply allows themselves to become involved in the situation on screen, it can become quite psychologically jarring. I really believe one of the reasons that so many hated the film, myself included, was due to both expectations and an inability to actually put themselves in the place of the actors. To actually experience the movie! It certainly didn't help that the audience I saw it with was laughing. If you can take that step, then ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a very effective and clever film. So the question is, is it OK to ask the audience to commit so much of themselves to a film for them to be able to have an emotional reaction (other than boredom). The more I think about it, the more I think the answer is yes. The problem has been created over an extended period of time, with more and more blockbuster movies that require nothing of the audience whatsoever. No thought, no belief, no experience...nothing! That being the case, when a movie such as this one comes around, it's understandable that people may just find it boring as they have lost the ability to actually ""experience"" it or in some cases, simply choose not to let themselves.No, I haven't done a complete turn around and gone from a Blair Witch basher to a Blair Witch lover. It's not a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination. The epileptic camera movements still make it hard to watch, the inability to hear what's going on in the forest and some of the bickering still gets on my nerves. But I must admit it all makes it far more realistic and it's all very intentional to get the desired effect. The acting is actually pretty damn good. The fact is that in all likeliness, normal people would fight and cry and scream and carry on exactly the same way these guys do. There are moments of absolute terror in their voices and sheer emotion on their faces which is a credit to the actors. I can't say there's anything I could suggest they should have done differently that would make it any more realistic than it is and for that reason alone I consider the movie to be a success. It is a movie to be experienced alone in the dark though.

I hadn't seen this movie in years, yet a silly nightmare made me think of it again.Blair Witch is like that.  I saw the movie after it opened and laughed at the end.  I didn't hate it; just thought it was rather silly...interesting, but not terrifying.  But the film had done its trick by taking hold of my mind...touching the psycholocal triggers of terror lying in wait.A few years ago I was hiking in a familiar woods with my husband.  It was a bright fall day...nothing at all sinister about it.  But we found ourselves lost for a bit...playing around and not being careful...oh, let's go this way; it's a short cut to the trail.  Well, we stomped around for an hour and found ourselves BACK WHERE WE'd STARTED.  That chill of terror ran down my back, like biting down on a bad tooth, hitting the raw nerve...Blair Witch.  Needless to say, we calmed down, figured out how to get safely back, but the terror was real for awhile.I recently re read Bill Bryson's funny and well written A WALK IN THE WOODS..about hiking the Appalachian Trail.  The chapter about the Maine woods is especially graphic...reminding me again of Blair Witch.America is full of wilderness...even in Maryland.  And the mind is full of imaginings and nameless terror.

The movie is about three student filmmakers who wander  off in the Maryland woods while filming a documentary.  What we see is  cleverly presented as the footage that was found a year after their  disappearance.The beginning of that footage introduces us to the Blair  Witch legend.  We see Heather (the director, well played by Heather  Donahue) interviewing people from the town of Burkittsville (formerly  Blair).  They tell us how, years ago, the bodies of seven children were  found in the woods.  Legend has it that the woods are still haunted.  Most  folks seem to avoid the area, but not our filmmakers who are quickly seen  shooting away in the midst of it.  And even though Heather claims to know  exactly where they are, it's soon evident that they're lost.  &quot;We'll  all look back at this and laugh heartily, believe me,&quot; she says.  But  her partners Mike and Josh aren't buying it.  And Mike reminds her that  &quot;I agreed to a scouted out project.&quot;In the midst of all the in  fighting, the trio discovers a number of scary things - piles of rocks and  stick figures that could only be man-made.  They also hear sounds at night  in their tent that MIGHT be a deer, but sure sound more ominous.The  low-budget &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot; was a big hit at Sundance and I  really like how the movie shows Hollywood you don't need big special  effects to make a good horror film.  It's not necessarily about what you  show us, it's more about what's implied, what is, in fact, not shown.  The  movie's last shot is a good example of this.  I've been thinking about it  for a while now.

469329,A1YUA1ZMB2Q1XJ,6305568901,Boy,"[14, 14]","First off, do take heed of the top two reviews posted here: ""Give Credit Where Credit's Due""  and ""IGNORE THE STAR RATING HERE..."" - they are even-handed, articulate, and amusing.As for me?  I say with confidence that BWP obviously ranks among the all-time great Horror films.  You can check out my Amazon ""Listmania"" list, entitled TOP 24 HORROR FILMS, to get an idea of my tastes.  Anyways, I'm a life-long Horror geek, and BLAIR WITCH is top ten without a doubt.  But bear in mind that I'm talking about smart-scary films that actually succeed in creating a palpable feeling of anxiety in the viewer.  Gore's a bore and cheap thrills are just that.Now I was fortunate enough to actually see this sucker in the theatre, and it was the only time in my movie-going life that I found myself literally slack-jawed and gaping at the screen as the credits rolled.  My date was also a bit freaked out by the end, and absolutely convinced - as so many others were - that the film was a true story, or at least heavily based on one.  Such was the power of The Project when it first stormed US theatres.So disregard the inappropriately low star-rating and the horde of befuddled clue-frees who posted them.  Horror films only really work when experienced under the right set of circumstances.  Ideally you should be alone in a darkened room with the film playing on as large a screen as possible.

469330,A3H4TIVTTA5IBB,6305568901,Brian A. Wolters,"[2, 8]","The Blair Witch Project is a scary movie indeed. Personally, I have gone out looking for local ""scary"" legends and at times, spooked myself silly. The Blair Witch project gave me a chance to investigate another ""local legend"" from the comfort of a theater seat. There are some really good chills in this film and it starts out quite nicely, but it is all ruined by a lack of intelligent dialogue.The movie opens where our ""three brave heroes"" prepare for their trek into the woods to investigate the ""Blair Witch."" The interviews with the town locals are very interesting and believable. This builds up the mythos behind the legend. The interview with Jim King about Rustin Parr was extremely convincing and brought a since of realism to a film that we know to be fiction.Then they head into the woods. Everything starts out just fine; in fact, the cast even seems a little disappointed. In their second night in the woods, they start to hear sounds and mostly pass it off as deer. Then the next night and the nights to follow, more strange and insidious things happen.The best thing about The Blair Witch Project is that you never quite see anything scary. All of the scares come from the acting, sound and lighting. The cast does a good job, especially Heather Donahue. Despite her Razzie award, she is the strongest in the cast. The sounds in this film are quite chilling and the scene where they hear the kids laughing really brought goose bumps! And the final scene stuck in my mind for days!All of this excellent material is ruined by poor choice of words. Sure they were scared and most of the film was improvised, but the profanity reached a point of ridiculousness. It seems as if they used profanity as adverbs and adjectives rather than for pure emotional impact. This definitely was the most disappointing aspect for this film.The DVD is excellent! It is packed full of extra's including the Blair Witch special, deleted scenes and trailers. The ""special effects"" on the menus are also well done.All in all, I was scared and chilled by this film, but I cannot recommend this film because of the unnecessary profanity.",2,Profanity Ruins A Truly Scary Film,988761600,"05 2, 2001",2001,2129,"['Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'scary', 'movie', 'indeed', 'Personally', 'have', 'gone', 'out', 'looking', 'local', 'scary', 'legends', 'times', 'spooked', 'silly', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'project', 'gave', 'chance', 'investigate', 'local', 'legend', 'comfort', 'theater', 'seat', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'chills', 'film', 'out', 'quite', 'nicely', 'ruined', 'lack', 'intelligent', 'dialogue.The', 'movie', 'where', 'three', 'brave', 'heroes', 'prepare', 'trek', 'woods', 'investigate', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'interviews', 'town', 'locals', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'believable', 'up', 'mythos', 'legend', 'interview', 'Jim', 'King', 'Rustin', 'Parr', 'was', 'extremely', 'convincing', 'brought', 'realism', 'film', 'know', 'be', 'fiction.Then', 'head', 'woods', 'Everything', 'out', 'just', 'fine', 'fact', 'cast', 'even', 'little', 'disappointed', 'second', 'night', 'woods', 'start', 'hear', 'sounds', 'mostly', 'pass', 'off', 'deer', 'Then', 'next', 'night', 'nights', 'follow', 'more', 'strange', 'insidious', 'things', 'happen.The', 'best', 'thing', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'never', 'quite', 'see', 'anything', 'scary', 'scares', 'come', 'acting', 'sound', 'lighting', 'cast', 'good', 'job', 'especially', 'Heather', 'Donahue', 'Razzie', 'award', 'strongest', 'cast', 'sounds', 'film', 'are', 'quite', 'chilling', 'scene', 'where', 'hear', 'kids', 'laughing', 'really', 'brought', 'goose', 'bumps', 'final', 'scene', 'stuck', 'mind', 'days', 'excellent', 'material', 'ruined', 'poor', 'choice', 'words', 'Sure', 'were', 'scared', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'improvised', 'profanity', 'reached', 'point', 'ridiculousness', 'used', 'profanity', 'adverbs', 'rather', 'pure', 'emotional', 'impact', 'definitely', 'was', 'most', 'disappointing', 'aspect', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'packed', 'full', 'extra', 'including', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'special', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailers', 'special', 'effects', 'menus', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'done.All', 'was', 'scared', 'chilled', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'unnecessary', 'profanity']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

Like some other films I have seen in the last several years, ""Blair Witch"" had a great concept that was thoroughly squandered by cheap execution. The production would have fared so much better had it been filmed as an actual movie. But, instead, we are forced to sit through an endless barrage of spliced together footage from a video camera that is really no better than watching the next-door neighbor's home movies.A great many of my friends recommended this to me upon it's initial release, heaping unprecedented amounts of praise at it as one of the most frightening and altogether brilliant movies they had ever seen. I really must beg to differ. I have seen literally hundreds of other horror and suspense thrillers in my thirty-four years of existence, and ""The Blair Witch Project"" doesn't hold a candle to any of them. How anybody can rank it as a worthy contender to ""The Exorcist"" and look themselves in a mirror without laughing staggers my imagination.The overall concept was fantastic, as I said. Hence my two-star rating. Aside from that, there really is nothing further I can honestly recommend to anybody about this film. The $40,000 budget speaks for itself. Rent, if you must.

469335,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,6305568901,Busy Body,"[5, 8]","I have seen The Blair Witch Project a total of two times now, and have been scared to death each time I watch it. I tell myself I shouldn't watch it, but I do because I like to scare myself, like most lovers of the horror genre do. Judging from reviews on here, people either love or hate this movie. I am in the love camp, because there are so many reasons to like this film. It's unlike anything that has ever been released before it and it stands out as unique and original. In a way I can understand why some people say this film did not frighten them one bit, but they are obviously the people who like their horror films with blood and guts shoved through their screens. I, on the other hand, am a horror fan who prefers the suspense and dramatic tension that is built up in a movie, as my imagination can run wild and create something as violent and horrific as it wants to. With The Blair Witch Project, you are free to make up your own mind about what is going on. There are no set rules. Things are evil and chaotic, and that's what's so good about it. Remember this is the film that cost a mere $22,000 to make and grossed more than $240,500,000 worldwide. That's a box office ratio of 1:10,931. Little did the filmmakers know that they would make $10,931 for every dollar they spent on the film. Ka-Ching indeed.In October 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch. A year later their footage was found. This film is supposed to be the actual footage of what was found a year later, but it obviously isn't because it's been made as The Blair Witch Project. However, the acting in this film is so incredible and realistic that you are drawn into their world and can't help but believe that it is truly real.The three filmmakers are Heather (Heather Donahue), Josh (Joshua Leonard) and Michael (Michael Williams). The film starts with all three travelling on their way to Burkittsville. When they arrive they interview several residents of the town and ask them what they think of the legend of the Blair Witch. The responses are varied. Their happy spirits and jolly personalities only set the shock factor higher for later on in the film. Later on after they have captured enough footage they park their car and set off into the woods, beside a cemetery. As time goes by, however, Josh and Michael begin to realise that they are lost. Heather is the leader of the pack as it was her idea to make this documentary, and she insists they are not lost. Through the day it seems just like a normal forest, but at night, things starts to get really creepy. They are miles from any civilisation, and the lack of any natural light is incredibly spooky.The way The Blair Witch Project is filmed in 100% documentary style is absolute genius. There are no special effects, no sound effects, no special lighting, just one camera that moves up and down a lot. Heather is the narrator for most of the film, and is desperate to make this adventure a success. While Josh and Michael insist they are lost, Heather says they are not. She is too wrapped up in catching everything on video that she doesn't pay any attention to where they are. The first ten minutes are highly enjoyable, and their trek into the woods is great. Once nightime falls, however, things really go bad. As the trio huddle in their tent at night, they hear strange noises outside. Crackings of twigs and smashing on stones outside scares them to death. As the viewer we can't see anything except the odd tree, so we don't know how far away the evil is. We don't know what it looks like, we don't know what it's doing. Everything is shrouded in mystery and ambiguity that we can't help but let out imaginations run wild of what could be going on, and that is the genius of the film.Josh gets lost one night, and Heather and Michael are livid wondering where he is. They believe he's run off, but we as the viewer know he has probably being snatched. Heather's final speech is a cinema classic, and the ending in the abandoned house is extremely disturbing. Listen to what a resident of the town says about what the Blair Witch did to children in the house, then watch what happens at the end of the film. It's extremely chilling. The man standing in the corner as Heather films him. Who is the man? Josh? Or Michael? Or someone totally different? Heather suddenly remembers what the resident said, and she knows what's going to happen to her as the camera falls to the floor and she screams.OVERALL GRADE: 10/10The only bad thing about The Blair Witch Project is loose-lips Heather and Josh. They say the F-word more times than you could count and it really starts to grate after a while. If you've been living under a rock since autumn 1999 and you haven't heard of The Blair Witch Project then I urge you to watch it. It stormed into England's Top 10 100 Greatest Scary Moments Ever last night on UK TV, and I have to agree. You will either love this film or hate it. I love it, because it's original, ground-breaking and a total masterpiece in gothic horror cinema. Anyone can spend millions of dollars making a Hollywood blockbuster and make it not scary in the slightest, but you can't deny that this is a very scary movie once you take away the monsterous hype.",5,If You Go Down To The Woods Today....,1067212800,"10 27, 2003",2003,5339,"['have', 'seen', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'total', 'two', 'times', 'now', 'have', 'been', 'scared', 'death',

It's a very unique, experimental movie, one which had elements from  my childhood nightmares (getting lost, being in a strange house,  etc.).Why it works, I think, is because so much is unseen or vague,  leaving much of what is going on to your own imagination, sort of like  Jaws, where the most intense scenes are those where the shark isn't even in  sight.  Hitchcock understood this concept, that less is more.Unfortunately, today's viewers (especially younger ones) are jaded by  the glut of gore and special effects in modern Hollywood horror movies,  which may explain the negative reviews (worst movie ever?

What made this film scary in 1999 and scary now is what you don't see and what you think you hear as well as the growing paranoia and fright of the college kids lost in the woods over a period of days that find - as they run out of food and supplies - that they are just wandering in circles.The very last scene is particularly chilling, and if you already know how it ends it will kill some of the fright factor for you. However, this film just proved in 1999, as it still does, that you don't have to fill a horror film with wall-to-wall state-of-the-art CGI visual effects and shocking violence in order to be scary. I personally think the horror genre has been much worse off since Jason and his ilk first invaded the movies back in 1980 with graphic violence that is predictable and, quite frankly, boring.

When this movie played at Cannes,  it was said that people were throwing up and running out of the theatre.  Artisan Pictures (who bought the rights to the movie) announced it was due  to the fact that it was sooooo scary. Having watched the film, I think  maybe because it was because the film was soooo shaky....Anyway, this  movie is very good in it's setup.  Three college kids, led by Heather, are  making a documentary for a class project.  They want to do a documentary on  the Blair Witch Curse and on a cold, sunny weekend,grab their stuff and  head to Blair, Maryland.  After getting background information, they decide  to head off into the woods and find the home of the Blair Witch.  They  begin to lose their way, and their sanity as they begin to hear  indescribable noises late at night and become paranoid, blaming each other  for the mess they have gotten themselves into.The movie concludes with  them finding an old abadoned house and ends with their demise when they  finally get to meet (speculated) the Blair Witch herself.  This of course  is not a spoiler, because the premise of the movie is that we see the  demise of the students based on the cans of film that were found in the  woods a year later.The cinema verite style of this movie is refreshing  and the grainy film stock is a departure from all those slick horror movies  that tend to show you everything ahead of time and leave you with no  imagination that have been released in the 1990's and 2000.  Most of the  fear WILL be based on your imagination and if you lack one, then this movie  will be downright boring.  Many people did not like the movie on this  premise alone.  However, since I have a very active imagination, my heart  beat did rise above it's usual 70 BPM on a few occasions.The  characters were all believable as film students and act very naturally.  I  don't know if this is because they ACTUALLY were amateurs and were just  being themselves or because they are GOOD actors.  Heather Donohue does a  very good job as the self-confident team leader who breaks down by the end  of the movie.The only complaint that I had was that the movie was  becoming a little repetitive by the 4th act and that the low budget of the  movie creates this &quot;home video&quot; quality that I will never fully  recommend anything more than 3 stars for.

I loved it, appreciating its gradual mounting of the supernatural threat until, too late, the characters realized that they have been surrounded and cut off from reality by it.  The plot is remarkably simple, and similiar (read King's The Girl Who Loved  Tom Gordon for an interesting variation), unwary travelers wander from the  beaten (aka SAFE) path and, one by one, fall victim to someTHING in the  dark shrouded woods.  The unseen and unknown are where the thrills come  from, and the shaky hand held camera work gives the viewer the  feeling/sensation of being an active participant in the unfolding events.

Nothing wrong with stars like that, but theres no way this film would have worked with them.3) Think about the Black & White effects. Only other B&W; film I can recall in recent years thats actually been distributed to most theaters was Schindler's List - and its a hit too. (In fact, SL is in the top 10 or 20 all time great films. Admittedly, BWP isn't in the Schindler's List class of course, but see what B&W; can do for a story ???)4) There was absolutely NO GORE. No blood...nothing. And still scary as he**.5) Its gotten over 1500 Amazon reviews. I've seen much more famous films with far less than that.I have to agree with several other reviewers who say that those trashing the film seem to have issues with the way the story was marketed (in fact, staged:).

I was very dissapointed.  It had a lot of umm points that would seem to lead to a  climax then it would die down.  I expected to see a witch or at least a  figure of one in the movie, but I didnt see anything.  The movie didnt  really come to a real scary part until the end.  The end was kind of good  so it wasnt all bad.  After I took my girlfriend home, and drove back to my  place by myself thats when I started to really get scared.

""The Blair Witch Project"" was among the three most talked about movies of that year, along with ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" and ""The Sixth Sense.""This movie was all the rage when it first came out. Many had no idea that this movie was actually a fictional story filmed so that it would look real. Some would say that when all the hype is taken away, this movie isn't good. I beg to differ.I pretty sure that when I went to the theater to see this film when it first came out that I already knew it wasn't real footage of three teens being stalked by the Blair Witch. So I was simply viewing the movie for what it was - a realistic depiction of a fictional story. It was done quite well. After viewing it on DVD, I still say it packs a punch, especially if you watch it late at night alone in the dark by yourself (with the sound turned up).This movie is unjustly maligned by a lot of people, and deserves more credit than it has received over the years. It seems like every movie done in a similar style, such as ""Diary of the Dead"" and ""Cloverfield,"" is referred to as being filmed ""Blair Witch style."" That has to count for something.

A few months later, my girlfriend saw it in a box and wanted to watch it, so I did. That was back in 2002, and I've since come to appreciate this film for what it is. A great story was created, and the premise and execution was raw and emotional, giving the film a little extra kick. Many directors have tried to make similar films to this one in the years that have passed, and none of them have been nearly succesful. This film taps into the fears we all have as children, and mixes it with an urban legend in unpredictable fashion.To this day, this is one of my favorite films, because it is unlike anything I've ever seen.

Take a Dramamine before watching, and you'll be fine.Besides, the creepiest stuff isn't what you SEE, it's what you HEAR.

I can no longer say just how many times I've watched this film, but I become more and more impressed with its production with each viewing.  I can't really imagine how so many people can claim that this film didn't scare them in the least.  I am a long-time horror fan, inured long ago to almost everything the movie studios throw out there on the big screens with a ""frightening"" label.  The Blair Witch Project, I am delighted to say, creeped me out quite impressively.  It may well be that this is a different movie experience depending on the venue of its audience.  Those watching the film for the first time at home can turn off all their lights and watch the movie in the dark, but there is really no way to recreate or equal the powerful mood and atmosphere that came rushing in icy waves on to a theatre audience.  When I go to see horror movies, there is almost always some laughter to be heard from time to time, and usually I am the one doing the laughing.  Once Heather, Michael, and Josh got into the Maryland woods and the spooky meter began to rise, an eerie, almost unprecedented silence took over those of us sitting in the theatre.  There was no laughter; I heard no one sucking on a straw or chomping on popcorn; no adolescents whispered back and forth.  There was no longer an audience around me; I and the film were locked together in a mortal embrace, and as the suspense built up at the end I felt as if some force were pushing me farther and farther back into my seat.  When the movie ended, I don't remember anyone really talking about what they had just seen; I think we all just wanted to get the heck out of that darkened theatre.  That kind of experience, I must say, is what my horror dreams are made of.  Viewing the film at home just cannot recreate the movie experience.To me, The Blair Witch Project is simply brilliant in many, many ways.  First, of course, Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick used the Internet to build up a hype of unprecedented proportions for this film many months before its general release, creating a thriving fan base drawn deeply into the legend of the Blair Witch and the mysteriously doomed student film project, mucking up the waters of truth and fiction into a bloody froth that attracted horror sharks such as myself from far and wide.  Then there was the SciFi Channel documentary Curse of the Blair Witch that was released just prior to the film's release.  In this remarkably professional and believable documentary, the fictional story of the movie was given sturdy legs with which to scurry around the truth.  The actors used in the documentary were amazingly good, and the use of family photos, old historical documents and letters, newspaper articles, television news features, interviews with law enforcement, family and friends, etc., did a great job of masquerading fiction as reality.  Even those of us who knew going into the theatre that this was a work of pure fiction could allow ourselves to wonder if the story could still actually be true, and that suspension of disbelief did much to increase the power of what I saw on the big screen.Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams were simply brilliant.  Their displays of fright, rage, and hopelessness were stunningly believable; of course, some credit for the actors' performances must also go to the geniuses behind the film.  I would imagine that the dark woods would become quite unnerving after a few nights, even when you know that whoever or whatever is out there is just someone associated with the film production, and the fact that the characters were forced to endure sleep-deprived nights and grueling daytime hikes over the course of a full week had to do wear down the defenses of the actors and bring to the surface emotions and expressions that lie too deeply to be accessed simply on command.  I am still fascinated to read about the way in which things were managed in the filming.  The actors ad libbed almost everything they said and did, which is actually quite amazing.  At times, though, they had to redo things in order to please the filmmakers; the best example of this comes in the movie's final scene.  As I understand it, the scene in the movie is actually a second night's shoot of those events, as things did not go quite the way the filmmakers wanted on the first night.  To see that kind of emotion and fear portrayed by an exhausted Michael and Heather on a second night's take is just outstanding.This horror fan welcomed such a refreshingly new type of movie to the fold.  I like blood and gore as much as anyone, but true fright is best achieved by unspectacular yet highly personal events taking place in what looks very much like the real world as we know it.  Millions of dollars have never made an expensive, special effects-laden horror movie as creepy as this extremely low-budget masterpiece of mood, atmosphere, and unseen things that go bump in the night.",5,Absolutely brilliant and genuinely frightening,1059782400,"08 2, 2003",2003,5024,"['Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'most', 'brilliantly', 'creepy', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'can', 'no',

469376,A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ,6305568901,"Daniel S. ""Daniel""","[2, 7]","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT deserves, in my opinion, the perfect 5 for several  reasons. First of all, it's a movie with an original screenplay full of  ideas, very well conceived and a lot more professionnal than what we have  to digest all year long. Secondly, I know that it's extremely difficult to  shoot a movie which must follow as a pattern a documentary filmed by  semiprofessionnal people. Thirdly, I was really impressed by the actors  involved in the project and I never had the impression to watch a  fiction.But, principally, I'm glad that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT reminds  us one or two truths about cinema and movies. One cannot judge a movie by  saying that the action is not plausible, that, in the case of THE BLAIR  WITCH PROJECT, the characters are not reacting in a normal manner, that  they should have followed the river downward, etc. If you want to see real  things, open your eyes and go get lost into the woods yourselves. Then, you  will encounter real things.Cinema is not about REALITY. Cinema is a  filter letting the IDEAS of a director or a producer become moving images.  The most important scene of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is the scene presenting  Josh while filming Heather and discovering that the camera changes reality  and acts as a filter. The camera is reassuring. At this moment, one can  hear the directors of the movie murmuring to our ears : what you are  watching is not reality , it's only OUR reality translated into images so  don't judge it by your standards of reality but by the impression THE BLAIR  WITCH PROJECT will make on your mind.I'm aware that my interpretation is  not particularly &quot;in&quot; in 2000, a cinematographic period  presenting very graphic movies, the more the movie is surgically precise,  the more the average moviegoer is happy. But what I'm sure of is that the  best directors of Movie History are certainly not Michal Bay, Steven  Spielberg or Wes Craven but rather Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, Orson Welles  or Werner Herzog, directors who tried to translate their dreams into  images.A DVD for my library.

Reilly,"[0, 0]","Everybody knows the story of The Blair Witch Project: 3 student filmmakers go missing after heading into the woods to make a documentary about a local legend. I saw the movie a few times when it was originally released theatrically, and was blown away by it. I bought the DVD to see if it still held up, especially after the disastrous Book of Shadows debacle...I'm happy to say that, while I don't necessarily think it's a watershed of filmmaking, Blair Witch holds up as a great horror movie, something horror fans get precious little of. The constant bickering of the characters seems more noticable now that the newness is gone, and the acting doesn't seem quite as good. Also, as I've expanded my horror horizons, Blair witch doesn't seem quite so original, either. (See Ruggerio Deodato's late '70's jungle epic ""Cannibal Holocaust"" for a more gore-oriented spin on the same concept of vanished filmmakers, and ""The Last Broadcast"", which preceeded Blair Witch by a few years, and seems like another unacknowledged inspiration, and also has a more satisfying ending.) Blair Witch has lost none of it's creepiness, or it's power to disturb. For my money, the last shot is one of the creepiest in cinema history.The DVD comes with some nice extras, including the 45-minute ""Curse of the Blair Witch"", originally shown on the Sci-Fi channel, which is incredibly informative and well done; ""Newly-discovered footage""- A forgettable 5-minute scene; A timeline of Blair Witch sightings and events, Director Commentary, and a fairly easy-to-find Easter Egg: Highlight the stick man on the extras screen, and you'll be able to access trailers, TV spots, and a trailer for ""The Stand"".Overall, a great DVD.

When it got all the press and started making tons of money I knew the backlash would come, because people that  shouldn't see the movie were going out to watch it. The public is used to  neat little movies wrapped up in cute little packages, and this movie  doesn't do that. It's raw, shaky, ad-libbed, not very cohesive, but it  works. You need to suspend disbelief and just put yourself in that  situation, what would you do? We slowly but surely watch these people  unravel as the movie goes on, talking less, getting tired, hungry, scared.  You can see it on their faces, and it's horrifying to watch. I have seen  alot of horror movies in my time, but this was the first one that made me  actually made me lose sleep. The day after I saw it, I was telling a friend  about it and got goosebumps just by thinking about the ending. The DVD  rocks because it has the best director commentary I've heard yet. These  guys were so down to earth and give you tons of great trivia about what was  going on during the shoot. And there's the Sci-Fi special making the blair  witch seem all the more real.  I only have one complaint, what's with the  border around the picture? It makes the movie look fake, a full screen, no  border shot would've given the movie the home video feel that it needed at  home, watch the extra scene on the dvd, it's full screen, you'll see what I  mean.

There, they lose the map,  their minds, and eventually, their lives. This is probably the scariest  film since the original Halloween. This was only an experimental  film. It was totally what i expected and then some. The actors are very  believable and kudos to Dan Myrnick and Eduardo Sanchez for their  involvement in pretty much everything this movie dishes out. Sure, it won't  win the Best Picture Award or anything, but it's impossible to deny that it  will soon become a classic (how many times have you seen Heather's  confession parodied on so many TV shows around the nation?), and will spawn  many clones. They're already making a sequel to it which kind of ruins its  originality and purpose. Bottom line: an enjoyable indie with some pretty  suspenseful moments and even more scares and chills.

Because the little Old Woman goes hunting for a soupbone, only she doesn't go to the local Super Target, nosirree: she heads down the windy lane through the darksome woods and does a little spelunking in the ancient cemetery.You know, for her soup bone. To make her nightly chow.And that would be that, except it turns out that something nasty comes calling in the wee hours of the night, looking for its bone.With that tucked into our cape, let's consider ""The Blair Witch Project"", a stripped-down, bare-bones excursion into the grisly, nasty, unforgiving horror that lurks in the deepest, darkest thickets way out at the back of beyond.Turns out there was once an Old Woman named Elly Kedward, who lived in a hovel on the verge of the Woods. Only this particular Old Woman did far worse than finagle a few finger bones from the local boneyard for her noontime chow: she invited the little neighbor kids into the hovel because---well, they say, because she wanted their blood.Being that it was the Year of our Lord 1785, and the folks in nearby Blair, Maryland were of a distinctly different moral fiber from their latter-day descendants: more Doctor Cotton Mather, very little Dr. Phil---well, they banished Poor Old Elly from town, strapped into a cart, hauled off into her Woods, and left to die of exposure.Maybe they should have picked someplace other than the Woods, because evidently Goody Kedward was a big believer in not going softly into that good night. First something awful---a curse, rippling up out of the thickets---took away all the children of Blair, erasing the town entirely.In 1825, a search party out of Burkitsville---founded on the old site of Blair---canvas the woods in vain for a hapless little girl reputedly pulled into a creek close to the final dying place of the old Witch: they never find her, and for weeks thereafter the creek runs with tarry, oily bundles of sticks.Then in 1886, another search party goes looking for a missing boy, and never returns: they are later found bound in a pentagram on Coffin Rock, disembowelled.There's more, of course: always involving missing children, and madness, and bundles of sticks and twigs and stones, and those haunting, desolate Woods.Which is part of the attraction to the three student filmmakers---Heather, Mike, and Josh---who, in 1994, arrive with gear and questions to the modern-day hamlet of Burkitsville. It's like something out of an Edward Gorey tale, really: they depart from town for the Woods, and they enter the forests of the Black Hills.And they never come out.Now: ""Blair Witch"" purports to be nothing less than the unedited footage of the three missing students, found buried in the detritus beneath a colonial house undisturbed for a century. It is shot both in high-end digital video and, occasionally, 16MM,intended for the serious footage of the student film.What emerges is a deep and dark excursion from the levity of a weekend jaunt into the woods, into extreme terror. The most delicious thing about ""Blair Witch is the immediacy of the horror: Dan Myrick & Eduardo Sanchez may have felt the heavy hand of a micro-budget in keeping the filming lean, mean, and joined at the hip with the young protagonists, but the result is electric: you are a fellow passenger on a journey into the Strange and the Doomed: it's like looking over the shoulder of the Titanic's captain on the fatal day.The brilliance of ""Blair Witch"" is its primal simplicity: it offers an excursion into the woody territory of the King of the Horrors, old when Man's first progenitor hauled itself up from the waters: the Fear of the Unknown.Anyone who has hunted in the high mountains, or gone for a walk in some rustic forest, knows that Fear well: can attest to the point at which the Woods became dark, the atmosphere positively seethed with menace---when it became evident that the intruder was not only not welcome, but hated.The juicy, nasty gristle of ""Blair Witch"" is that crawling, ovewhelming sensation of having been moved from reporter to victim: being stalked, deep in the Woods, by something hungry, and Evil, and cold, and totally insane.Lovely?

469385,A34JAXR0W215IP,6305568901,Das Book,"[0, 0]","(NOTE: I first wrote this review in 2000, then rewrote it in 2007.)As others have noted, there's not much middle ground on this movie: you either like it or you hate it. And I'll be honest, there are good arguments to be made both ways.One of the most common complaints is that there's a lot of arguing; and make no mistake, that's absolutely true. Almost as soon as the trio sets foot in the woods, in fact, they're already bickering at each other, and it only gets worse as the movie progresses. Others complain that the Blair Witch--only the namesake of the bloody movie, after all--never actually appears on screen, and it's left up to the viewer to decide what really happens at the end. The mythology is fairly inscrutable, as well; it's never really explained in the film what those mysterious ""stick-men"" are supposed to represent, and the contents of the bundle of sticks that Heather discovers near the end are so blurred that they could be almost anything. (For the record, according to the feature-length commentary, they're human teeth. Because Heather's holding the camera so close to them, they appear larger than they really are, which has led to some fairly colorful speculations among fans.)But really, all of that adds to the beauty of the whole project. Any psychologist can tell you that fear, especially mortal fear, can manifest itself in countless ways, one of which is to lash out at the people around you; who among us can say that we'd behave any differently? I'll grant that it's stretching credibility that Mike would so callously throw away their only map and then admit to it as gleefully as he does, but otherwise, the trio's behavior is surprisingly accurate. And yes, the ending is ambiguous; but then again, so is the ending of ""2001,"" which is widely hailed as one of the finest films, science fiction or otherwise, ever made. Sometimes the best endings are the ones that aren't spoon-fed to us.But to truly appreciate what a work of genius this film is, it helps to remember the context in which it was released. This film was one of the first serious attempts by a filmmaker (or team of them, in this movie's case) to create a universe outside of the movie proper, a practice that's common today in the form of the alternate reality game. The Web site, although fairly sparse nowadays, was at the time instrumental in providing much of the film's backstory, particularly the history of the Blair Witch legend itself (it's worth mentioning, incidentally, that it's a testament to this movie's impact that the web site still exists at all); and the accompanying documentary, ""Curse of the Blair Witch""--which is included on the DVD--used professional actors in its cast, but was filmed in an extemporanous manner that made it utterly indistinguishable from a legitimate documentary. So successful were the filmmakers, in fact, that the legend of the Blair Witch is still occasionally taken as fact even today, eight years after the movie was first released. And they did it all on a budget of only $40,000; in Hollywood, that kind of money is treated like bus fare.  I will concede that, since the movie relies so heavily on supplementary materials like the web site and documentary, it remains to be seen if it still has the same impact in twenty years that it did eight years ago.  A truly great movie should be timeless, or as close to it as possible, which may well prove to be this movie's fatal flaw.As for the argument that we never see the witch, all I can say is that sometimes it's what your subconscious percieves that makes something scary, not what your eyes tell you. After all, your subconscious knows exactly what keeps you awake at night. If you've got an open mind and some time to kill, watch ""The Blair Witch Project."" Just don't do what I did and watch it right before bed.(The DVD itself is full of extras, as many early DVDs were; there's the aforementioned feature-length commentary, plus the ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" documentary, along with the obligatory collection of trailers.

It's almost like when you scare the hell out of that kid when you are in 6th grade, and he might have been screaming wide-eyed with fright, only to tell you a couple minutes later ""Hey, You Didn't Scare Me"", just to repair his pride or ego. When I first saw ""Blair Witch"", it did scare me, and left me a little rattled at the end.....why? Because when I went to see it in the theater, there was still a strong buzz about the movie that it was either really an aborted documentary, or was a film based on true events...we were supposedly seeing the genuine article. Sure, I may have been duped by a clever marketing campaign that involved TV mocumentaries, internet gossip and radio buzz.....and looking back I think that was great. ""Blair Witch"" if nothing else, is a wonderful homage to William Castle, who back in the day of ""The Tingler"" would wire theater seats to shock select members of the audience to induce a well timed scream, or his film ""The House on Haunted Hill"", where skeletons would buzz the audience, or his movie ""Straight Jacket"" in which he offered the audience a chance to buy life insurance in case the film scared them to death. That is great stuff that put butts in the theater seats, and with the advances in technology, and modern communication, ""Blair Witch"" and it's marketing campaign did the same thing, only the updated version.

No. I applauded the idea behind the movie, and only wish more films would do the same.

We are  never told directly what the characters in the film are seeing. We are  never given a glimpse of the horror persuing them in the woods. Directors  Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez take the best approach to this type of  story, leaving the horror in the minds of it's viewers. The imagination is  so much more powerful than CGI or special make-up effects that a couple of  college kids screaming at something off-camera could keep you up for days  and days without sleep. As we all know, it isn't being alone in the dark  that frightens us as children... it's of NOT being alone in the dark. The  thoughts of what might be under our beds... or watching us from outside our  darkened windows... that's what scares us. That's what makes The Blair  Witch Project unique. It doesn't tell us to be scared of anything. It  allows us to project our own fears into it. That would also explain why  it's one of those 'love it / hate it' movies. Some people need something to  scream at. They lack imagination. Other people don't. The latter will get  the most out of this picture. The phenomenal acting (most of which was  ad-libbed) and dreary locales are major pluses. But it's the little  things... the bumps and scratches... the shadows... the sound of dead  leaves cracking in the darkness... That's what makes this film so powerful.  It will stay with you for days, months, even years. Brace yourself. You're  not getting out of this one untouched.

For one thing, real documentarians do not film every petty disagreement, and watching argument after argument gets a little tedious.  Second, the characters are not sympathetic in the least.  They act stupidly (one throws away their map?  Why?  Good question) and do little besides swear at each other.  Some scenes, such as the much imitated &quot;God I'm so scared&quot; scene could have been effective  if we had been able to develop any sympathy for the characters. Finally, although being lost in the woods is a frightening situation, we are supposed the believe they are really afraid of some gothic horror menace.  Said horror is kept off screen, and when done well this can be very effective.  In this movie, it is done poorly, and thus it looks silly.  We have the characters freaking out over a pile of rocks and a tree with stick figures hanging on it.  I mean, come on, STICK FIGURES!

469397,A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,6305568901,D. Blankenship,"[51, 57]","This was and is, for me, a most fascinating film on several levels; the film itself being only one of the interesting points.  Take a close look at the reviews that have been posted here on Amazon...look at them closely.  We are quickly approaching a total of 2,000 reviews and if you check the spread you will instantly see that people are quite divided.  It is almost an even split between those who love this film and praise it in many ways, and on the other end, those who absolutely despise everything about this work.  I like that...just goes to illustrate the wonderful diversity in taste we humans are blessed with.  What if we all liked the same thing?  Boooring!If you bother to read through these almost 2,000 reviews, dating back to 1999, you will note that this difference in opinion has generated a number of ""flame wars"" amongst our reviewers here.  Whoa, talk about striking an emotional chord for a lot of movie viewers and buffs.  There simply are not that many films that seem to polarize like this film.  And again, personally I think that is a good thing.I first watched this film shortly after its release and I must confess to you that at that time I was on the side of those who were not overly impressed.  I remember my first reaction was ""What the.....""  Since that time I have watched this film five or six times, with the last viewing being last night.  I have changed my mind.  The reason for this number of viewings is not that I was all that enamored with the movie, but rather that I keep very late hours...very, very late, (Insomnia you know) and do a tremendous amount of channel surfing in the wee hours of the morning.  And that is where you will find this movie residing now...lost in the jumble of late night T.V.  I have to tell you that over the years this one has grown on me.The movie of course as we all know by now, broke some new ground, both in filming technique, and in marketing.  The story is simple.  Three young college kids head out into the spooky woods intent on making a documentary film concerning the Blair Witch.  The filming is done by hand held cameras.  There is little to no script and the entire movie looks as if it were indeed filmed by three college students with hand held cameras.  The students become lost, scared, hungry, cold and bewildered.  Strange things begin to happen. Emotionally the students begin fighting, bickering and the personal stress level of each increases. Why?  There are no special effects in this movie, little or no blood and gore and as with the lost students; the viewer is required to let his or her imagination take over with only slight guidance from the film.  If all goes well, this can be a terrifying movie.  If all does not go well...it can be a complete waste.Indulge me for a moment and let me explain why I seem to be able to identify with this particular movie.Years ago, over fifty of them to be precise, my then girlfriend, who eventually became my wife and still is, took a day trip deep into the Boston Mountains of Northern Arkansas.  I was very much into black and white photography at the time and we had heard rumors of an old house place in the middle of no-where and I wanted to photograph it.(I have a thing for old buildings, barns, houses, etc.  After much research and question asking, we had a pretty good idea where this old place was located.  After a very long drive, over extremely bad roads which at the end included wheel ruts down through the woods, we found the head of the path that supposedly led to this place.Leaving the car in the middle of the woods we took our rather primitive backpacks (Army surplus) and about a ton of photography gear, a couple of cheese sandwiches, a small amount of water, and headed out.  It took us over three hours going over very rough and difficult terrain (It was in August and extremely hot), much more rugged than that which was depicted in the movie, but we finally located the old house.  It was in the absolute middle of nowhere.  There where no roads, very primitive and old paths, and was located about 50 yards from an ancient creek bed. The house was most certainly well over 100 years old.Now his was long, long before this movie was produced, but this old home, while smaller, bore an eerie resemblance to the Blair Witch home which we would see in the future.  Of course we did not know that then.  Anyway, we went about the business of setting up to photograph the place, inside and out. I made f few obligatory passes at my friend but we were so hot and dirty by that time, the moves were more or less half-hearted on my part and nil on hers.I am not what you would call a strong believer in the supernatural...at best I am a skeptic; at worse, I admit that there are things beyond what I can explain.  But let me tell you that we both, my future wife and I, were extremely ill at ease...right from the get go.  There was something about that old house that was just ""wrong.""  This feeling built and built over the next couple of hours or so to the point where we suddenly and spontaneously decided to get as far away from the place as we could.  Oh my.Neither my girl friend nor I were or are unfamiliar with wilderness area.  We both did and do pretty much know what we are doing.  But let me tell you that within 30 min. we were completely lost!  I do not know how it happened, but lost we were...and it got worse; it got to the point of almost absolute panic.  The longer we struggled to find our way out, the more, and I do not exaggerate here, the more terrified we became.  We were absolutely convinced that ""something"" was watching us and ""something"" was following us.  I know that this was more than likely a product of young and over active imaginations; I know that now, but let me tell you that it was very real at that time.It was very much after dark when we finally found our car which was a matter of absolute pure luck.(Brilliant me did not bother to pack any sort of flashlight...something that was strongly pointed out to me at the time).  We did not scream or curse at each other during this ordeal like the three in the movie did, but I can tell you that there were plenty of sharp and sarcastic exchanges, particularly on my friend's part, during those hours.And the story did not end there!  I shot a total of 16 rolls of film during that shoot; they were good shots....I think.  When I developed the film, every roll, and I mean every roll was completely black!  I am pretty good with a camera, both artistically and technically...was then; am now.  I don't make mistakes like that and never have.  I will be very honest with you though, after all these years we have never, never, never been even the slightest bit tempted to go back and reshoot.Anyway, I know how those three would have felt had the story been true.I think that for the viewer to appreciate this movie they need to let their imaginations loose and just go with the flow and try to get into the spirit of the film.When all is said and done, the marketing of this film was a stroke of brilliance.  It cost around $40,000. to shoot and has made millions over the years and is still making money.  After reading these reviews it is still apparently entertaining a lot of people and a lot of people still think it is a horrid movie.  Again, this is good...I like the controversy. Ignore the hype...watch it and make up your own mind...more or less ignore all of these reviews; the good, the bad and the ugly.As I said, ignore the star rating on this review...it is almost meaningless.  I have read the negative reviews and the positive reviews and for the most part agree with them all...on some level. I will say though, that if you have not watched this film you should do so, if for no other reason than to find out what all the hoopla is about.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",5,IGNORE THE STAR RATING

Three college students vanish into the Maryland woods while filming a documentary about a witch to prove or discredit the myth surrounding it. Their footage is uncovered. This is what you see...Marshmellows...documentary-style interviews...joking around...restlessness...anger...endless tirades about the missing map...a stick figure dangling from a tree...a  Gilligan's Island joke around a campfire...running...screaming...snot oozing from the nostrils of one of the main characters as she trembles and mutters her apologies...more running and screaming...THE END.I usually don't prefer to spoil essential plot elements or twists, but the problem with ""TBWP"" is that it doesn't have any. The sequel it eventually spawned is truly ten steps backward and worse than its predecessor, so I suppose you would have to cut this one a decent amount of slack, but despite the fact that it has little to no meat on its bones, the film is shot very well. It's a shame because Myrick and Sanchez could've utilized that potential with more oomph and given us some real scares instead of needless bickering about the map.I suggest you rent it first before buying it.

Let's leave out the fact that it is shot totally in a documentary format; there's just too many things to complain  about concerning that aspect.

While sequences during the night when  the sounds come out to play are supposed to be horrific, the running  through the woods and the violent shaking of the cameras make it an  unenjoyable moment. There's really nothing else to complain about, except  at times you wish they would just find the damn car and go home to eat  Mother's mashed potatoes.

It is refreshing not to have to sit through so much padding, and I must admit I only nodded off  once during the film. The arguments the three people keep  having are both  funny and realistic, reminding me of my own camping trips when I was 18  years old.The actors seem a bit older than that though,  seeming to be  in their late twenties rather than 18-21. I suppose they could be mature  students.The music is eerie and superb throughout, and when combined  with a decent sound effects track makes for as good a good demonstration of  surround sound as I have heard on a DVD. The good sound quality slightly  lets down the realism, as the sound guy in the film doesn't seem near  enough to capture a lot of what he purportedly picks up with his  equipment.The extras on the disk and the uniformity of design and  atmosphere show that someone has really taken trouble over the preparation  of this DVD.

Mok,"[1, 5]","The Blair Witch Project fails completely as a horror film -- those who said it was scary probably didn't have enough experience with horror -- and  all the marketing ploys to make it &quot;real&quot; fell short and ended up  sounding ridiculous (&quot;recently discovered footage&quot;?  Give me a  break -- there's no visual continuity with the rest of the movie; chances  are this was shot after the movie became a hit).But The Blair Witch  Project, to me, succeeded on another level -- one of the oldest tricks in  the book, catharsis.Nothing in the movie was genuinely scary -- the  totems, the little bloody something Heather finds, the noises.  Sometimes  spooky, yes, such as the well dressed abandoned house setting, but not  scary.  However, the dramatic tension was quite well done, and the actors  likeable.  When Josh jumps on Heather's &quot;moviemaking&quot;, it's a  pretty touching moment.  This movie also has some good comedic moments  livened up by the spontaneous tone.Whether you'll like The Blair Witch  Project, ultimately, depends on how much visual variety you seek.  There is  none in this movie -- endless handheld shots of trees and growth.  However,  the emotional side of it and the character identification (to me, the only  plane on which this movie's true efficacy rests) worked for me.One  interesting thought:  This script would make a dandy radio play.

Its the girl's school project; the two guys agreed to help her for a couple of days. While shooting the film, they had to leave their car parked at the edge of a wooded area and walk into the woods carrying backpacks with tent, cameras and other necessities for a couple of days stay. On their return they got lost.I've seen a number of this sort of film, ""home movies"" of events experienced by 'ordinary people' filmed as they seem to be happening. They vary in quality but, some, like this one, pretty well hit the mark of authentic seeming home movies. Shot in this manner, while still a fresh idea, they (and this one), have an interest beyond that of the plot-line. A good deal of that interest rests on the ability of the actors to act entirely as if they were not acting.

THIS movie is dark, creepy, and does NOT have a happy ending (yaay!)To truly understand this movie you really have to step back to 1999 (c.e.) and hear the rumors of ""the Blair Witch"" from friends, the fledgling internet (which has only a few hundred thousand indexed websites anyone really visits, not the billions of pages with youtube and myspace now. In fact, this movie WAS youtube. You see, we all heard the whisperings of some dumb kids who got lost in the forest and got killed. Then the Discovery channel had a special on ""The Blair Witch"" the day before the movie came out. THAT was what cemented the marketing.The problem with the (fake) ""documentary"" was hat it was just a little too transparent. It made you want to believe (like you might want to believe in happy, friendly aliens) but it just seemed a bit cheesy and fake. Then there was the website. It was  an ""almost ran"" but the fact that they were selling Blair Witch merchandise BEFORE the movie opened almost killed the entire scam.So you sit down in your seat of a packed movie house and hear the nervous whispers of everyone else asking ""is this real?"" and then the movie starts - a real documentary. The rest is history. Shaky camera work that gives far too many people nausea, the sudden ending that shocks and angers people when hey realize they just got ""punked"" (before there was a ""Punked"" show). This is movie magic at a time when almost all competing movies were [...] formula - and let's not mention television. This movie shocked th public awake and almost - allllmost worked in a BIG way. If they had played their cards a bit closer to their vests and demanded the public believe, instead of hawking merchandise and fake documentaries for a few extra coins, they would have had a PT Barnum worth masterpiece scam on the public.Nonetheless, the movie cost nothing to make, sold for 2 million at Cannes I believe, and made TONS of money in the first two weeks before dropping off the radar and finally becoming a pariah. forget the sequel.

469423,AA5XZVANDXGJE,6305568901,"""dvdcollector18""","[1, 1]","I consider this to be one of the best horror movies that I own. The film is about three film makers going to film a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch. When hiking in the woods they get lost and then thats when the movie picks up pace. The ending of the film is really sudden and creepy. The reason I loved this film is becuase it was really scary, but they never really show anything. So it lets your imagination scare you, and it leaves you with an impression that you can not shake for a good while. This is really a unique movie expierience.The DVD Picture and Audio are really good considering what was used to film it. The film was never in a Widescreen format, so it is presented on the disc the was it was shown theatrically at a 4:3 aspect ratio. The disc does not have a Dolby Digital 5.1 Soundtrack but a Dolby Surround 2.0 Soundtrack which still is terrific to hear. The sound really has effect on you in Chapter 17 where they are running through the house trying to find Josh.The supplements are very nice on the DVD. First there are the regular Cast and Crew Bios and a couple of Trailers (teaser and theatrical). There is also &quot;The Legend Of the Blair Witch&quot;, where it is basically the timeline of when the events related to the Blair Witch occured. The best bonus is the special &quot;Curse of the Blair Witch&quot;, a documentary that takes place as if the events of the Blair Witch happened in real life. It basically explains all the events that occured regarding the witch that were mentioned in the movie with more detail and explanation. Watching this special really added effect to what had occured in the movie.A few DVD-ROM features are added to, but nothing really special: just some excerpts from the comic book, the Dossier and a copy of the Map from the movie.I based my 5 star review on the film, sound, video, and supplement quality of this DVD.",5,THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT DOLBY SURROUND 2.0 DVD REVIEW,974419200,"11 17, 2000",2000,1899,"['consider', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', 'own', 'film', 'three', 'film', 'makers', 'going', 'film', 'documentary', 'legend', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'When', 'hiking', 'woods', 'get', 'lost', 'then', 'thats', 'when', 'movie', 'up', 'pace', 'ending', 'film', 'really', 'sudden', 'creepy', 'reason', 'loved', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'scary', 'never', 'really', 'show', 'anything', 'imagination', 'scare', 'impression', 'can', 'not', 'shake', 'good', 'while', 'really', 'unique', 'movie', 'expierience.The', 'DVD', 'Picture', 'Audio', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'considering', 'what', 'was', 'used', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'Widescreen', 'format', 'presented', 'disc', 'was', 'was', 'shown', 'theatrically', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'disc', 'not', 'have', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Soundtrack', 'Dolby', 'Surround', '2.0', 'Soundtrack', 'still', 'terrific', 'hear', 'sound', 'really', 'effect', 'Chapter', '17', 'where', 'are', 'running', 'house', 'trying', 'find', 'Josh.The', 'supplements', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'DVD', 'First', 'are', 'regular', 'Cast', 'Crew', 'Bios', 'couple', 'Trailers', 'teaser', 'theatrical', 'also', 'quot', 'Legend', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'quot', 'where', 'basically', 'timeline', 'when', 'events', 'related', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'occured', 'best', 'bonus', 'special', 'quot', 'Curse', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'quot', 'documentary', 'place', 'events', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'basically', 'events', 'occured', 'regarding', 'witch', 'were', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'more', 'detail', 'explanation', 'Watching', 'special', 'really', 'added', 'effect', 'what', 'had', 'occured', 'movie.A', 'few', 'DVD-ROM', 'features', 'are', 'added', 'nothing', 'really', 'special', 'just', 'excerpts', 'comic', 'book', 'Dossier', 'copy', 'Map', 'movie.I', 'based', '5', 'star', 'review', 'film', 'sound', 'video', 'supplement', 'quality', 'DVD']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

469425,A2F7PEA3G37YDT,6305568901,dylan21484nj,"[2, 2]","If you've seen The Blair Witch Project, you probably fall in three categories - people who were scared stiff, people who didn't see what the big deal was, or people who got so motion sick that they had to stop watching. It's very much one of those divisive films, and I am proud to say that I loved this film and was left wide-eyed, gripping my seat tightly in the movie theater as the final credits rolled.The film, made for only $25,000 (though some have inflated that amount to $40,000) is presented in a ""found footage"" style, a truly novel approach as the film we're watching isn't being shown through some steady, static ""magic window"" looking in on the characters without their knowledge as nearly all films are presented. Later films like Cloverfield and Paranormal Activity also used the ""found footage"" approach, but this film was the precursor to them all, and every film that has used this style since has often been described as ""Blair Witch  in a Godzilla Movie"" or ""Blair Witch in a House.""Here, the cameras, the film stock being used, and the handheld ""shaky cam"" cinematography are all a part of the story. Presented as recovered film footage pieced together to present the journey of three student filmmakers making a documentary about a local legend who gradually find themselves becoming the legend's newest victims. This cinematic approach and the performances given by the ""student filmmakers"" (who were really a trio of young actors skilled in improvisation) was so effective and believable that many were lead to speculate that the film's events were real. But of course, they weren't. But Artisan Entertainment's marketing of the film harnessed that speculation through websites and message boards (being the first real film to utilize the then-fledgling internet as a legitimate promotional tool) and TV and radio ads that portrayed the film as true events. Moviegoers flocked to the theater to make up their own minds.What they got was the story of Heather, Josh, and Mike, who end up lost in the woods for over a week in late October of 1994 while filming a documentary about the Blair Witch, who some blame for numerous mysterious disappearances and deaths over the span of several centuries. Many days pass as the trio trek through the Maryland woods in their slow descent into fear, paranoia, and desperation. As they hike trying to find their way back to their car, frustrations being to mount as the map they brought proves useless, they run out of food, and the trio begin to turn on each other, bickering and arguing as their situation worsens.At one point, hope of escaping the woods truly becomes lost, as despite walking in the same direction for an entire day, they inexplicably end up back in the same place. It becomes clear that a supernatural force does not want them to leave, a force that leaves haunting, intricately made stick figures and rock piles for the trio to find during the day and terrorizes them by night with eerie sounds in the distance, leaving the trio (and the audience) to only imagine who or what stalks them just beyond the light of their campfire and just outside the view of their camera lenses. You too will peer into the darkness, looking for any kind of clue to what horrible creature is out there waiting for them. And as they are seemingly lead to a condemned house, your eyes are glued to the screen as their grim fate awaits inside.I can only guess why others don't find this film scary. Maybe people are so used to the typical approach of a static camera and smooth camera movements that the handheld approach takes them out of the film. Perhaps they are so used to films that show you a grotesque creature and buckets of blood and gore as a ""payoff"" that their imaginations never take over, and their hopes expectations for a typical payoff are left unsated since you never see the Blair Witch. Maybe they just see three kids roaming around in the woods with a couple of cameras that they can't see the creativity of being able to tell what is essentially a ghost story without the need for a big budget. Whatever the reason, it's truly their loss.The Blair Witch Project is a triumph of minimalist filmmaking, a film whose concept smartly takes advantage of the most basic elements needed to elicit fear, like the urban legend every small town has, the simplistic and natural fear of being in the woods at night in late October, and the fear of what lurks in the darkness just outside of your view.",5,"Brilliant approach to a film, brilliant marketing campaign, brilliantly frightening",1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,4475,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'probably', 'fall',

The days of independent drive-in-type movies that were made with a minimal budget but lots of imagination are long gone. True, they were often a hit-and-miss proposition; some were great, some were awful, but they were uniformly fun to watch. Not so now. Hollywood has appropriated the horror movie. Such a movie now is a multi-million dollar extravaganza with slick special effects and a cookie-cutter plot. So, I was hooked by the ad campaign for this movie. It was presented as a triumph of the cinematic outsider using a mimimal budget and a lot of ingenuity to overcome the restrictions of an entrenched Hollywood that all too often caters to the lowest common denominator possible. Unfortunately, this film was a great disappointment to me. The shrill, amateurish acting I could have withstood. After all, a lot of landmark horror movies (&quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; is one that immediately comes to mind, or &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;) are not noted for the efficacy of its actors. This plot, however, is pretty non-existent. Basically, it consists of unpleasant people staggering lost through the woods and screaming at each other. Hopefully, one of the benefits of this film is that it will inspire other budding movie-makers to scrape together whatever resources they can and give it their best shot at translating their inner vision onto film.

Soon, they begin losing their civility and become more and more like  animals. The Blair Witch Project is an excellent film in the fact that it  goes gradually exposing the feelings and fears of the characters in a very  raw and brutal way. They are lost in the middle of the woods and there is  &quot;something&quot; out there stalking them, taking it's time...feeding  on their fear.

For a while, people went to see it and left without really knowing what they just saw, and passed along what  they thought was going on.  In the end, massive amounts of people went to  see the movie to find out the truth, and the truth is this: the blair witch  project is a fake documentary made by a group of improvising actors filming  themselves and led on by a group of directors lingering about but never  coming face-to-face with the characters.  The reason why the story confused  people is because there was no story, and if an explanation ever does come  out, it was written after the movie was filmed.  Basically the movie had no  plot, completely flat characters, no theme, no moral, no backround, no  conflict and no conclusion.  In fact the majority of the film is a group of  confused people wandering around in the woods with a camera and NOTHING  happening.

Well ladies and gentlemen,apparently this experiment was actually somehow done and The screenplay for this movie was the result. Basically, if have only 100 or fewer working brain cells, then this movie is definatly for you. Buy it immediatly. The plot is good the characters are funny, and it is truely scary.For those of us who can read at at least a 2nd grade level, and do simple math such as one plus one equals 2, dont bother with this .... The people who say that this movie is for intelligent and smart people, are the same people who spend millions of dollars on pet rocks. And then when they bought a pet rock, they bought another one, hoping that they might mate and that they would get rich too by selling baby pet rocks.And for the poeple that say that this is a movie that requires you to use your imagination, that is true. With that being said and based upon the 100+ million dollars that this movie recieved, It got me woundering how easy it is to get rich in this country. It got me thinking of a possible movie i could produce. And this is what I came up with....take a few of those glow in the dark sticks, and pay a few kids to hold them in their hands and jump on the bed in a completely dark room, screaming as if they are being killed or somethinig, and play some scary music over it. Bingo you got a hit. It would be a great movie for all those intellectuals who like to use their imaginations. Basically this movie exemplifies why it is so important to rent before you buy.

Everyone was so hyped to see it, including myself!  I went the first week it opened, with my boyfriend at that time...  We were all excited, and couldn't wait to be terrified by this awesomely scary movie...  And I remember walking out of the theater thinking ""WTF?  That wasn't scary.""  We both felt robbed of our money and our time...That said, I have since watched it at home and will say that it really does tend to be scary.  At the time when it was released onto VHS, I lived at home with my parents whose house was out in the country, with forest on two sides.  I got the VHS and watched it one night when I was home alone.  And finally, I felt a little of the terror that this movie was supposed to induce.  The forest, at night, is a scary place.  Especially when you're lost!  So, yeah, I can totally imagine freaking out if while lost I seemed to be traveling in circles all the while creepy stuff keeps happening around me!So there you have it: the creep factor is there for this movie, you just have to watch it in the right setting.

469435,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,6305568901,Elisabeth,"[1, 2]","Going into this movie, I suspected the Blair Witch legend would be similar to the Bloody Mary legend, and it was.  One woman in the film described the Blair Witch as a woman covered in hair...which is what I also heard about Bloody Mary.  However, another man claimed the person responsible for the neighborhood killings was a man who made his victims face the corner before killing them.  And then, throughout this film, it actually seemed like a group of people were the ones hunting people down.So who, ultimately, were responsible for the killings...a woman, a man, or a group of people?  If a man was responsible, then shouldn't the movie be titled ""Blair Warlock""?  Or if it's a group who's responsible, then shouldn't the movie be titled ""Blair Cult""?Because this movie has ""witch"" in the title, but also has these other suspects, too, it made this legend hard to follow.  Maybe the movie should've been titled, ""Blair Unknown Subject(s)"" instead.Another problem I had with the movie is that it's slow-moving in some parts and the whole map fiasco scene was so implausible, it almost ruined the film for me.  But thankfully, other aspects of the movie made up for it.What makes this movie so scary is not what you see, but what you don't see.  You don't see any gore (except for the ""present"" left by the tent), you don't see any special effects or even the witch herself.Instead, you see strange rock formations, eerie stick figures hanging from trees, and hear loud cries in the dead of night.Simple scare tactics, yes, but nonetheless are creepy because they're reminders that this trio isn't alone out there in the woods.Because this movie started out as a hoax as a real documentary, the aim is to appear as realistic as possible.  It succeeds in doing this by using unknown actors, unscripted dialogue, and unsteady camera filming.  The wobbly cam might bother some, but it didn't bother me...which is surprising given how easily nauseated I get.  I guess I was too captivated by the story to care.Watching this movie was fun because it reminded me of past camping trips where we'd sit around the campfire telling scary stories and someone would  inevitably  claim one of the stories was actually true.

469436,A3L31489BCB1D7,6305568901,El Kabong,"[8, 10]","Sorry to quote Jesse, but I couldn't resist. This movie has garnered much divided opinion; both camps are right. It sucks AND it's great. First of all, immediately dismiss every opinion that whines 'where's the blood?'. Simpletons who need monsters and gore to officially enjoy a horror movie should park their cars on road shoulders and read back issues of FANGORIA while waiting for the next highway fatality to rubberneck. This is essentially a ghost story, and ghost stories frighten with mood and suggestion, not with slashed carotid arteries. But most of the naysayers have a point: after the overkill of the media hype, you DO walk away deeply disappointed after the first viewing. The narrative structure, such as it is, is clumsy and tedious. But part of that disappointment is due to the fact that horror movies are marketed to yahoos, and otherwise-rational viewers have become all too willing to think and act like yahoos when watching a horror movie in a theater. And who can blame 'em, after 20 years of dumbed-down, market-researched 'rollercoaster ride' horror that feeds the mob a steady, predictable diet of CGI, 'dream' sequences, unkillable brand-name psychos, and wisecracking teenage hardbodies. To release a serious, straightfaced, artistic horror movie nowadays is to ask audiences to think unsettling thoughts and FEEL something genuine: far easier to let the latex do the talking over a heavy-metal soundtrack and hope you can con enough kids into believing a 'director's cut' DVD of ELM STREET 12 is a statement for the ages worth owning. Now, while BLAIR WITCH is far from perfect, it does have one 'monster' that no fx wizard could ever approach...those damned woods. Anyone who's ever gotten lost on a camping trip, or even driven through the woods at night, knows exactly what I'm saying here. There's something deeply, frighteningly eldritch and pre-human about wooded areas. Nature isn't Bambi and Grizzly Adams...it's harsh, unforgiving, cruel, remorseless; the territory of elder Gods who predate our warm and fuzzy civilized notions of deities and divinities. To live out in those woods and survive extracts a price so terrible that our ancestors finally fled, formed societies, created cities....ain't NOTHING scarier than the wild. As the three kids in this movie venture deeper into the woods, I felt a deep intuitive foreboding forming in the most primitive jelly of my brain. They're doomed because they've learned to be afraid of people but they've forgotten to be afraid of Nature, and deeper they go into a place where the very terrain- the rocks, the trees, the dirt beneath their feet - is the predator stalking them. All the faux-hostility they've learned from rap music and schoolyard brawls can't help them now. If you saw this flick and left the theater underwhelmed, see it again, alone, late at night. You might think twice about preserving any rainforest anywhere. The 'movie' part of BLAIR WITCH may be weak tea, but those haunted woods are scarier than any weightlifter in a hockey mask.",4,Stay Out Da Bushes!,1004140800,"10 27, 2001",2001,3042,"['Sorry', 'quote', 'Jesse', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'movie', 'garnered', 'much', 'divided', 'opinion', 'camps', 'are', 'right', 'great', 'First', 'immediately', 'dismiss', 'opinion', 'blood', 'Simpletons', 'who', 'need', 'monsters', 'gore', 'officially', 'enjoy', 'horror', 'movie', 'should', 'park', 'cars', 'road', 'shoulders', 'read', 'back', 'issues', 'FANGORIA', 'waiting', 'next', 'highway', 'fatality', 'rubberneck', 'essentially', 'ghost', 'story', 'ghost', 'stories', 'frighten', 'mood', 'suggestion', 'not', 'slashed', 'carotid', 'arteries', 'most', 'naysayers', 'have', 'point', 'overkill', 'media', 'hype', 'DO', 'walk', 'away', 'deeply', 'disappointed', 'first', 'viewing', 'narrative', 'structure', 'such', 'clumsy', 'tedious', 'part', 'disappointment', 'due', 'fact', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'marketed', 'yahoos', 'otherwise-rational', 'viewers', 'have', 'become', 'too', 'willing', 'think', 'act', 'yahoos', 'when', 'watching', 'horror', 'movie', 'theater', 'who', 'can', 'blame', ""'em"", '20', 'years', 'dumbed-down', 'market-researched', ""'rollercoaster"", 'ride', 'horror', 'mob', 'steady', 'predictable', 'diet', 'CGI', ""'dream"", 'sequences', 'unkillable', 'brand-name', 'psychos', 'wisecracking', 'teenage', 'hardbodies', 'release', 'serious', 'straightfaced', 'artistic', 'horror', 'movie', 'nowadays', 'ask', 'audiences', 'think', 'unsettling', 'thoughts', 'FEEL', 'something', 'genuine', 'far', 'easier', 'let', 'latex', 'do', 'talking', 'heavy-metal', 'soundtrack', 'hope', 'can', 'con', 'enough', 'kids', 'believing', ""'director"", 'cut', 'DVD', 'ELM', 'STREET', '12', 'statement', 'ages', 'owning', 'Now', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'far', 'perfect', 'have', 'one', ""'monster"", 'fx', 'wizard', 'could', 'ever', 'approach', 'damned', 'woods', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'gotten', 'lost', 'camping', 'trip', 'even', 'driven', 'woods', 'night', 'exactly', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying', 'here', 'something', 'deeply', 'frighteningly', 'eldritch', 'pre-human', 'wooded', 'areas', 'Nature', ""n't"", 'Bambi', 'Grizzly', 'Adams', 'harsh', 'unforgiving', 'cruel', 'remorseless', 'territory', 'elder', 'Gods', 'who', 'predate', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'civilized', 'notions', 'deities', 'divinities', 'live', 'out', 'woods', 'survive', 'extracts', 'price', 'so', 'terrible', 'ancestors', 'finally', 'fled', 'formed', 'societies', 'created', 'cities', '.ai', ""n't"", 'NOTHING', 'scarier', 'wild', 'three', 'kids', 'movie', 'venture', 'woods', 'felt', 'deep', 'intuitive', 'foreboding', 'forming', 'most', 'primitive', 'jelly', 'brain', ""'re"", 'doomed', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'be', 'afraid', 'people', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'be', 'afraid', 'Nature', 'go', 'place', 'where', 'very', 'terrain-', 'rocks', 'trees', 'dirt', 'beneath', 'feet', 'predator', 'stalking', 'faux-hostility', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'rap', 'music', 'schoolyard', 'brawls', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'now', 'saw', 'flick', 'left', 'theater', 'underwhelmed', 'see', 'again', 'alone', 'late', 'night', 'might', 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'preserving', 'rainforest', 'anywhere', ""'movie"", 'part', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'may', 'be', 'weak', 'tea', 'haunted', 'woods', 'are', 'scarier', 'weightlifter', 'hockey', 'mask']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

For these kids who had never really done real acting before this was actually very very good. They did a wonderful job I thought and on a low budget and pay as well. Just to get my foot through the door into acting and Hollywood, I sure as heck would've played Heather in a heartbeat! I would've been so scared that my acting wouldn't have been acting but true terror put onto reel because it would've been REAL!!! :)Going by Amazon's rating system and comments it doesn't look so well but I think over all it did great considering it's a very low budget film and for the fact that it did what it was suppose to do - bring in the bucks and more for the people who made this little flick. People have been and still are very curious about the movie (fiction or non-fiction) that it still sells well even on DVD. If it was so bad then people wouldn't even waste their time purchasing the DVD or wouldn't have gone to see the movie in the first place.For me, when I read the synopsis about a movie or watch the trailer and it doesn't really interest me or I say eh? maybe, then I don't waste my time on it. So this movie did pretty well over all I think ever since it came out and still does it seems.Now what I'm wanting to know is, could someone PLEASE give me their opinion or if they absolutely know about the last scene of the movie I would greatly appreciate it because it sure doesn't make any sense at all to me how it ends with Heather running after Mike with her camera through the house only to trip on something apparently and drops her camera which lands on the dirt floor only to show Mike standing in the corner of the house and all you see is his back side and then it ends. Now that really sucks and isn't much of an ending if you ask me! For one thing, Mike was to have tripped and fallen himself before Heather gets to the room he's in and then she trips over something and the camera lands on the floor. So why to find him back up standing in the corner? Just standing there and that's it? That is really beyond lame. As a Director I would've def. ended it very spooky and leaving the audience to have something REALLY scary to think about where the ending could've been ended in several different ways but something that made sense and even to see maybe a shadow of a Witch in the corner where Mike was standing like beside him or somewhere in the room. But to end it the way they did just didn't make any sense at all. Would love someone's take on the ending too if they know it or have a good explanation to it PLEASE reply me here! Thanks! :)P.S. - Blair Witch II was just horrible. All mixed up and really didn't make any sense whatsoever. Could've truly done a much better job than that piece of crap of a movie. Hoping a really good Director in the near future will make a Blair Witch III but will pick up where the first one left off a few years later and take it from there and not show another follow up to the second one which were just B. W. followers getting doped up and acting foolish the whole way through.

The director's approach to filmmaking was refreshingly different. He didn't need to rely on the same predictable garbage that Hollywood churns out every single day. To a certain extent, I still feel that way. I think it is possible for filmmakers to make a scary movie but without the relentless barrage of blood and violence (in no particular order). Now whenever I throw in &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; into the ol' VCR, the movie just doesn't seem like what it was when I saw it in the movie theater. &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; is still good in the sense that it lacks the corny special effects and the overuse of violence to engage the viewer. When I do watch this movie, I get annoyed with the three actors. Heather gets on my last nerves with her snivelling whining. Josh and Eric yells too much. Heck! All three of them yell and scream too much for my poor ears to take. Profanity isn't an issue for me. It is the yelling that is way too much.

469445,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,6305568901,Erik North,"[1, 3]","Not since NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD in 1968 or HALLOWEEN in 1978 had a low budget horror film grabbed the entire nation in the way that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT did when it was unleashed in the summer of 1999. Made for only forty thousand dollars by a group of friends in Maryland, BLAIR WITCH, by way of media and Internet hype, grossed over one hundred million.As everyone has heard, the film is about this group of teens who venture into the Maryland woods to learn of a legendary witch, only to find themselves confronted with the possibility that the Blair Witch is not merely a legend but is in fact a reality. One has to give credit to directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez and their friends, including the ever-pushy Heather Donahue, for giving the audience something more than just the standard teen-scare flick. The witch is (wisely) never seen, except for a few markings and demonic-looking stick figures. There's hardly any gore either (praise be!), and even the Shaky-Cam movements are bearable because you know they could never afford even part of a Steadicam on their highly limited budget.That said, however, I am only giving this film three stars, because this film falls lamentably short on two very important points. The filmmakers put up a great premise that has traces of John Boorman's 1972 classic DELIVERANCE scattered throughout, but the dialogue is so profanity-ridden that it becomes tiresome after a while, diminishing the film's suspense-laden story. Secondly, the acting, even by student-film standards, leaves something to be desired. Even Donahue's ""I'm so scared"" scene (done with a flashlight) doesn't seem terribly realistic.Does THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT still live up to the hype? In terms of its premise, I'd say it MORE than does. But if its makers had been willing to spend more time on the dialogue to reinforce the premise and the energy that went into making it, we'd really be talking about a masterpiece. As it is, BLAIR WITCH is a letdown of sorts, but only partially so; it's not the masterpiece some claim it to be, but it's not exactly a disaster either.",3,Split Decision On This PROJECT,1052438400,"05 9, 2003",2003,2105,"['Not', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'DEAD', '1968', 'HALLOWEEN', '1978', 'had', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'film', 'grabbed', 'entire', 'nation', 'way', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'unleashed', 'summer', '1999', 'Made', 'only', 'forty', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'group', 'friends', 'Maryland', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'way', 'media', 'Internet', 'hype', 'grossed', 'one', 'hundred', 'million.As', 'everyone', 'heard', 'film', 'group', 'teens', 'who', 'venture', 'Maryland', 'woods', 'learn', 'legendary', 'witch', 'only', 'find', 'confronted', 'possibility', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'not', 'merely', 'legend', 'fact', 'reality', 'One', 'give', 'credit', 'directors', 'Daniel', 'Myrick', 'Eduardo', 'Sanchez', 'friends', 'including', 'ever-pushy', 'Heather', 'Donahue', 'giving', 'audience', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'standard', 'teen-scare', 'flick', 'witch', 'wisely', 'never', 'seen', 'few', 'markings', 'demonic-looking', 'stick', 'figures', 'hardly', 'gore', 'praise', 'be', 'even', 'Shaky-Cam', 'movements', 'are', 'bearable', 'know', 'could', 'never', 'afford', 'even', 'part', 'Steadicam', 'highly', 'limited', 'budget.That', 'said', 'however', 'am', 'only', 'giving', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'film', 'lamentably', 'short', 'two', 'very', 'important', 'points', 'filmmakers', 'put', 'up', 'great', 'premise', 'traces', 'John', 'Boorman', '1972', 'classic', 'DELIVERANCE', 'scattered', 'dialogue', 'so', 'profanity-ridden', 'tiresome', 'while', 'diminishing', 'film', 'suspense-laden', 'story', 'Secondly', 'acting', 'even', 'student-film', 'standards', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'Even', 'Donahue', ""'m"", 'so', 'scared', 'scene', 'done', 'flashlight', ""n't"", 'seem', 'terribly', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'still', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'terms', 'premise', ""'d"", 'say', 'MORE', 'makers', 'had', 'been', 'willing', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'dialogue', 'reinforce', 'premise', 'energy', 'went', 'making', ""'d"", 'really', 'be', 'talking', 'masterpiece', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'letdown', 'sorts', 'only', 'partially', 'so', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'claim', 'be', 'not', 'exactly', 'disaster']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS
469446,A97Q71MM5N4NW,6305568901,"Everett ""Future Raptured""","[2, 6]","This has got to be by far the most scariest film I have ever seen in my entire life. You're not sure what to expect throughout the whole film. By the reviews it had gotten, I wasn't really sure what to expect. People I knew said it was not scary at all. Some other people said it was the freakiest thing on earth, and all the rest were pretty much mixed reviews from Amazon.com. I was open to anything at that point, and just wanted to be scared for a changed. I got more than I bargained for, by an independent film company, I was totally surprised that with a budget under 22,000 dollars, that they could make a movie so good, and so real, it was scary.The Blair Witch Project follows the story of three young college kids who just want to make a film based around the legend of a witch back in the 1700's that has carried on through the present time. Heather: the leader of this so-called movie crew, Josh: her partner and friend in the business, and Mike: their skeptical sound man are all ready and excited to explore the unknown. But then the three become undeniably lost in the woods just outside of Burkittsville looking for a cemetary. But there's more to the documentary than meets the eye, literally.Camping out the first few nights, eerie crackling sounds soon come from the distance beyond their campfires light. Heather anxiously wants to find out what it is, but Josh and Mike just want it to go away; wouldn't you? Voodoo dolls are unwantedly found by the unaware trio hanging all over a group of trees, and that same night, children's voices soon surround the area right outside their tent, and the three are attacked. And when Josh suddenly disappears the next day, Heather and Mike aren't even that confident that they can get out of the spiraling vortex the Blair Witch has them trapped in as the two slowly fall to pieces within their own sanity.I think the thing about the Blair Witch that made it the most scary and hard to get away from was the fact that you can hear all these sounds coming from the woods beyond them, yet the whole time, you never see a thing of it. The movie leaves your mind to do the imagining of what these three really are hearing, which is more scary than anyone can even think about. Is the blair witch really after them? Who were those children, and what did their ghosts look like after Rustin Parr murdered them?The special features on the DVD are pretty cool. You get the SciFi documentary on the Blair Witch ""The Curse of The Blair Witch"". It also has a commentary by the five main producers of the film which gives some pretty cool insight on how primitive everything really was when they made the film, and how everything they did made everything all the more scary beyond your TV screens sounds. And I know, the big complaint mostly on the movie is the fact that people are getting motion sickness. I'm probably one of the though ones that can take it probably because I've watched so many home movies, but it's understandable. For people who easily get motion sickness, steer clear of this movie. You'll be puking left and right.As far as the acting goes, these three unknown actors who go by their real names give such a real portrayal in the ways of their characters desperately trying to get out of the woods, it sends chills up your spine. Their acting almost takes you out of the movie, and into the story their telling all by themselves. Although I could've gone with the use of the ""F"" word so often, but hey, if you listen close, that's how people talk these days, even at my high school. Pretty sad if you asked me.But, I really liked the original idea of having footage found and using it as the surroundings to the movie. It's almost as if it's actually being showing right out of the characters eyes, rather than from your own view. You see what they see, and you hear what they hear. No more, no less.

Especially not slashers. I really, REALLY hate slashers - thankfully, this is not one. Now I didn't see this when it came out (I was in elementary school), and as I got older, I had no interest in it. But I was recently at a gathering with a couple good friends, and this one creepy guy who thinks he's my friend but is very wrong. Now, among the many creepy things about this creepy guy is that he has a freakish obsession with horror movies (though there are many other things that scare me about him, we're getting off topic), and since our gathering was just after Halloween he decided he'd bring a few of his favorites along. This absolute waste is one of them.Everything about this film fails miserably. Even the famous ""apology"" sequence seems forced, because I can't draw any emotional connection with our three protagonists, who seem to do little more than wander around in the forest, screaming and swearing at each other. My idea of good dialog is not, ""F*** you! You're so useless! I can't believe you f***ing dragged us all the way out here for nothing!"" and so forth. My reaction to them is at best apathetic.The film does start off interesting, with various interviews of townspeople about their experiences with the Blair Witch - when you can hear them, that is. But that lasts ten minutes or so, and even then my interest is only modest. During the end, which is supposed to be a chilling experience, I am terminally bored. There are no scares at all here - one scene I found to be disgusting, but that's about it. The plot is sketchy at best; the characters aren't fleshed out at all; the spastic camera angles give the film an authentic documentary feel but rend it unwatchable; and the ending is predictable before the first scene ends.

Either you really liked this movie or you hated it.I saw this movie the first time at the theatre surrounded by teenagers(how did they  get in in the first place? Someone wasn't doing their job of checking ID's)  From the opening words I was hooked. This is the best scary movie in a LONG  time.After the movie was over,I listened in on what some these teens  were saying. The majority of them seemed to not like this movie for two  main reasons....You never see a &quot;boogeyman&quot; or what have you. And  they didn't get the ending.Part of the problem I think the majority of  people had with this movie was they needed to use their imagination to some  extent. Todays young people have always had everything set out for them.  They see the &quot;boogeyman&quot;. They see exactly what happens to the  people in other films,quite graphically usually. They aren't familiar with  unknown sources of evil,and their imagination has not been put to good use.  . Your imagination can provide you with far more horrific scenarios than  what can be put on film. As for the ending apparently they weren't paying  to close attention to what they were seeing and hearing.The terror is  there lurking ever so quietly just beneath the surface. The slipping sanity  of the victims. Strange noises,lack of sleep,slowly losing your grip on  reality,a place haunted by previous evil........It all makes for one  terrifying ride if you just let your imagination have full reign.

With so many of horror movies trying to scare you so much by showing you everything that makes you feel uncomfortable, I give credit to a movie that shows that it is what you don't see that makes your blood tingle and your fear rise.The documentary approach was great. It made the story seem real, unlike so many movies that rely on these overdone special effects and gimmicks to scare the audience. I think that when a person goes to see a scary movie, he or she needs to feel uncomfortable; this is what this movie did. Much of the panic that the audience feels is from the dialogue and helpless situation of the 3 people out in the woods. You get a first hand view of the problems, and the terror that maybe something is actually after them.I think that most moviegoers have been lulled into believing that special effects and blood is scary; this movie proves that a story does not have to ""wow"" you to make you feel scared.

Let me tell you now; I'm a very squeamish and easily frightened viewer(I practically had a heart attack when a certain little girl crawled out of a certain TV-you know which movie I mean!) but this film did not have me diving behind the sofa cushions. Not even a little bit. It starts out good; the tension is there alright, but because it is set 'film documentary' style there is no atmospheric music to set the scene, which means any tension or atmosphere has to come from the actors. Maybe I'm missing the point, but a bunch of teenagers running around in pitch black woods whispering the 'f' word over and over-and yes folks, a good five minutes is spent where you can't see a darn thing and can only hear the sound effects as the kids drop the video camera and screech terrified obscenities to eachother-doesn't really entertain me that much. Even then the volume had to be turned up ridiculously high just to hear what they were saying, then turned down again in disappointment as I realised I wasn't missing much. I found the scene where they emerge from their tents and practically have a hernia over some re-arranged twig formations more funny than ominous. Was anyone else willing the Blair Witch to pop out and say boo? Anything would have been less laughable than twig formations!! It is true that a good horror flick can entertain you not by what it shows, but by what it doesn't, but here is where the movie fails. Had the teens been stalked and chased down by an evil presence then it would have been frightening and entertaining, instead we have three college-age idiots lost in some woods and behaving like hysterical, well, college-age idiots. 'AHHH!! A re-arranged twig formation!!!' Please. Can you say 'low budget?' Give us viewers some credit! And I won't go into the disaster that was ending. Just as the movie builds up some tension and genuinely grips you to the screen, the credits roll. I had to go back to the title menu screen and repeat that scene just to make sure the DVD hadn't skipped.

Also, shooting it in the woods removes the characters/victims from the ""normal"" world, making the suspension of disbelief easier.2.) Acting - you get the impression throughout that these people really know each other.  Also, you can clearly see the degeneration of their spirits, from the party attitudes at the beginning to the absolute despair Heather sbows in her ""final message"" to family and friends.3.)

You know that's not how it was but yet...could it be?  There is no masked psycho in the Blair Witch nor an evil monster hidden in some swamp.  What is creepy about this film is the realism and the mounting suspense.  You are waiting for something to happen; something to crash out and say ""Boo!""  You don't know exactly what that something is but you eagerly view on.  The ending may not be graphical in the sense that blood and gore horror flicks are but it does make you think and best of all, lets you use your imagination and deduction.  Despite the fowl language and immature behavior, you can't help but feel a bit for the three main characters in this film.  What would you do in their situation?  It may not be everybody's cup of tea and yes the camera angles get dizzying but as a riveting suspense flick it delivers a full blast.

It is filmed in ''Found Footage'' style, and it is about three students who are doing a documentary about a local urban legend. They go around the town of Burkittsville interviewing random people about the ''Blair Witch'', a ghost who supposedly many years ago haunted a man named Rustin Parr and made him kill many kids from the town. He would make one kid face the wall and he would kill the other, because he didn't like the feeling of the other kid staring. The people also say that the woods near Burkittsville are apparently haunted and that the Blair Witch still haunts a cabin in the woods. After they interview many people, including a woman who supposedly saw the Blair Witch face to face, they go to their hotel room and they call it a day. The following day, they go to the woods and they film constantly. During the film, they get completely lost after one of the guys throws away the map. During the day, they find piles of rocks placed in front of their tent, they find voodoo dolls hanging everywhere in the trees. At night, they hear wood cracking, a little girl laughing and screaming, and their tent gets shaken by a spirit outside.They run and scream and argue a lot during the movie, and some people may get exhausted from it, but I didn't.

Let me qualify that statement:  Jim Jones was a genius; the Enron scam was genius; and many others.I was prompted to go see this film because of a very engaging and ingenious Sci Fi Channel program (which I later realized was a one hour commercial for the film).  The one hour program was scary and interesting.  The film was anything but.The Blair Witch Project tells the ""true"" story of a group of twenty somethings who go investigate the legend of the Blair Witch in some remote part of Massachussetts or Maryland.  Using nothing but video cameras, the fimmakers intent was to give the film a raw and documentary feel to it and then go so far as to promote it as being a real film - the last film by this group of students - as they are supposedly killed by the Blair Witch.The video cameras used jump around so much that I became quite queasy watching the film.  The scripted dialogue (yes, it was actually scripted) is cheap and amateur.  The climax of the film is such a ridiculous thing that it is amazing that it did the business it did.  And, boy, did it do business.I can remember leaving the theater and overhearing a girl, sobbing her eyes out, talking about how horrible it must have been for those people to die like that, and how someone should do something so that no one ever has to die like that again.I laughed my head off at that.  And then I got angry.  I got angry that anyone could be so monumentally stupid as to believe the ridiculous story that had just been portrayed on screen.

However that idea fizzled after about 20 minutes into it for a few reasons. This was due mainly to the very obnoxious behavior of the would-be adventurers who set out on this supposed ghost hunt. These adolescents use four letter words in such a preponderance of pseudo intellectual ineptitude that I was hopping that they would all just vanish without a trace. They are the crudest, asinine and most repugnant characters I have seen in film for some time. Are we really supposed to care what happens to them? This is a film aimed at the teenage market. Are parents supposed to let their children be exposed to this offensive material? This film could have been presented without the use of the four lettered words, but I suppose the filmmakers would find that not politically correct. That was then. Looking back, I see some good film techniques that make it unique. It captured a certain look and it actually reminded me of Dudleytown, which is a ghost town in Cornwall, Connecticut. I was there three times when the public could walk through.

Of course, can a film shot on standard def video really benefit from a high def transfer.  As it turns out . . . not really.I didn't honestly expect this to offer an improvment in video or audio quality and it certainly does not but I'm a big fan of BLAIR WITCH so I made the trip to BestBuy (they have a two month exclusive on it) to get it early. It is an okay disc for $10 and there are a couple of things I like better about the bluray over the DVD. The odd 16mm projector windowbox that was used for the DVD transfer is gone giving us a standard 1.33:1 aspect ratio which is the way I remember it being during the theatrical showing. I thought the picture looked just a little bit better than the DVD with the color being slightly more saturated. I thought the audio sounded about the same as the DVD even though this bluray has a 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. It didn't offer that much improvment.The extra features are the same as the ones included on the DVD except the are rather poorly presented on this disc without a hard encode of pillar boxes so depending on your setup you may have to fiddle with the aspect ratio. The only new bonus feature consists of 4 alternate endings which are also poorly presented, forcing the viewer to watch more than a minute of the same footage on each alternate take before the ""new"" footage is shown. All the new endings really do is confirm that this film wasn't as ""improvised"" as the producer and director would lead you to believe on their commentary track.Lionsgate has added their usual warning screens, and forced bluray advertisements and trailers which must be manually skipped over. At least the disc is not BDLive enabled so the loading time is fairly quick.If you are a huge fan of BLAIR WITCH then you will want this for $10.

It either scared them or it didn't. Doesn't seem like there is an in between. Well my opinion is an in between opinion.The Blair Witch Project is a different movie to say the least. It's unique in that we never see the killer or demon that is supposedly causing all the mayhem and destruction. The movie about 3 young adults doing film research on the legend of the Blair Witch. The research takes them deep into the woods in the middle of nowhere. As they get closer to their goal they begin to hear voices and noises in the middle of the night. When things get too creepy they decide it's best to go home. At that point, however, they realize that the map showing them the way home has disappeared. That part of the movie was actually pretty funny. From there the movie takes off and has a decent ending, but I've seen better.The movie isn't really all that scary but if you let your mind wander, just let it slip into the movie, and make yourself believe that it is a real story and that was you in the woods lost with some unknown demon after you it could give you some chills.

The Blair Witch Project reminds us that the creepiest things in movies are in fact the things we can't see. The things you can only imagine how terrifying they are. The film gives us this message in a very original way by showing 3 student filmmakers hike into the woods to discover the truth of the local Blair Witch legend in Burkitsville.

469491,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,6305568901,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[2, 4]","The movie ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a one of a kind film that is completely based on the premise that ""sometimes what we don't see is what really scares us the most,"" and in many ways, this is quite true.  Indeed, this movie shows us very little blood, no gore and the audience never gets a view of the villain, but in a way, this really works because it keeps the audience in suspense and builds tension in the audience for the entire movie and, as a result, the audience's imagination runs wild.""The Blair Witch Project"" is actually done like a home movie in that there are three teenagers doing a documentary on the legend of the ""Blair Witch"" deep in the woods of Maryland.  The movie starts with a lot of interviews as a good documentary should and the audience gets a taste of what the teenagers are looking for or trying to discover.  The interviews produce some very interesting and scary stories and some horrifying death stories involving the disembowelment of some hunters.  Heather, Josh and Mike are the three teens or twentysomethings (hard to tell their age) in search of the truth behind this legend...is it truth or myth?  Well, in this movie, they are about to find out.The entire movie follows Heather for the most part as she walks and sometimes runs through the woods with her video camera catching the reaction, mood and fear of the group as they discover that the Blair Witch is a real witch and not just a ghost story.  The movie screen shakes as a video camera would on the run on an uneven and treacherous surface as the woods/forest can be.  The teenagers capture evidence of strange pieces of art involving rocks and sticks and the audience is left to assume that this is evidence of witchcraft in the making.It becomes obvious that the three teens or early 20-somethings are being toyed with by someone or some thing, but as the movie progresses and the audience sees these witchcraft-like works of art (which I found very effective), it becomes more apparent that the Blair witch is for real and these kids are in serious trouble.The group constantly fights amongst themselves as they try to find a way out of the woods, yet they go nowhere but in circles as the Blair witch manipulates the direction of the group and toys with them while hunting them in a terrifying fashion.  By way of criticism, the movie does hit a lull, as basically, the movie can only go so far with this whole idea of the documentary and really not revealing anything about the witch at all, much less does the audience see the witch.There is a sense of horror though as we follow these kids through their terror in the woods and as Josh turns up missing and Heather finds a present from the witch in a bundle of sticks.  So, the film is quite creepy, but it could have been even better if it had allowed the audience to get a look at this horrifying creature or witch, but that's just the point with this film, isnt' it?  The creators of this movie do not want you to see the witch because any conventional or made-up depiction of the witch could deflate the horror in the movie and make the movie look ridiculous.  In fact, the movie does a good job of making the audience wonder if there really is a witch or just some psychopathic serial killer in the woods.At any rate, the movie provides an eerie feeling to the audience which climaxes with the disappearance of Josh and the subsequent search for Josh that leads Heather and Mike to the lair of an obvious child murderer and perhaps a monster beyond their and the audience's wildest imaginations.  Indeed, an imagination is absolutely critical to enjoying this movie as the director is basically attempting to create suspense in this movie for the audience to the extent that the audience's imagination runs wild with conclusions and mental depictions of what the witch would look like that would be scarier than anything that the creators of this flick could put in front of the audience.  Indeed, to actual present a manifestation of the witch to the audience would be to limit or minimize the scary aspect of the imagination and the unknown which is what the creators of ""The Blair Witch Project"" rely upon to instill horror in the audience.  Therefore, the audience never actually sees the villain.  Hence, this is the charm of ""The Blair Witch Project"".I would be remiss if I did not warn that this movie is not for everyone and the viewer should not overexpect, but I proudly own this DVD as I think it's a good and original horror flick.  However, I also believe in the premise that this movie is based on, and that is that ""sometimes what we don't see is what scares us most"".  That said, I would like to point out that you can only go so far with this concept the way this concept is implemented in this movie, and that in order to create the perfect horror movie or a horror movie classic, you have to pick and choose moments in the film to show some things while not showing other things to really bring the horror home to the audience using a mixture of the abstract nature of the imaginations of the audience and the substantive and tangible horror of the film itself to create a very eerie and downright scary atmosphere which is essential to the creation of a great horror movie.In short, I really liked this movie, but, unlike many people, I never really looked at it as attempting to con someone or being conned to be believe that something like this is true or false, although many people hate this movie for that very reason.  I think the situation about the kids getting lost, getting angry with one another, being scared and the prospect of something evil being present in the woods hunting these kids is enough to create some degree of horror in and of itself.  I also thought the witch art was creative and effective at producing a fear of the unknown, a fear of evil if you will.  Another aspect that I really liked about this movie and which was very effective at creating horror was the setting and situation of the movie and the realistic and documentary-type feel which produced an atmosheric type of horror, which as I eluded to above, required the viewer to use his/her imagination.All things considered, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a VERY HIGH 3 STARS PLUS horror film that is quite good but not quite great enough to reach FOUR STARS status on my grading scale and not quite an all-time classic by any stretch of the oh so important ""imagination"", but as many other reviewers have stated, ""give credit where credit is due"" because this is a scary movie and the beauty of it is essentially this: gore is not scary in and of itself but the atmosphere/setting, situation and storyline ARE scary and that is what makes ""The Blair Witch"" product so good.  Unfortunately, there is not enough substance to ""The Blair Witch Project"" to make it great cinematic horror, but this movie is still very refreshing and very effective from a pure horror movie fan's perspective.  This movie really makes use of the ole adage: what we don't see is what scares us most, and I really like that as too much is being revealed to the audience and this sometimes dilutes the horror that the film can generate.  However, with that being said, this movie could have been an all-time classic with a little more substance and concrete depictions of horror.",3,3.99 STARS: Sometimes what we don't see is what scares

With the  minimal of money the makers, of this over-exposed movie, create a good deal  of tension and raw excitement. Of course there are a few logic errors but  I'm kind-hearted enough to see past that.Although this film is shown on  a 1.85:1 screen in the cinema the entire movie in is 1.33:1 because it is  all shot on video.

I've been watching horror films (Hammer, etc.) and reading horror books and comics (King,  Barker, etc) since I can remember, and I still think that BWP is by far the  scariest piece of fiction ever made largely due to it's realism and the way  it prompts viewers to &quot;visualize&quot; the implied terror in Heather  and crew's film.For maximum effect (especially for those who  &quot;just didn't get it&quot; including a number of my friends with whom I  have been heartily debating this for quite some time now), I'd suggest  buying this DVD (it's really worth it especially given the fact that it's  loaded with special features such as the  fake documentary et al coupled  with its low price relative to higher priced DVDs whose only so-called  special features are interactive menus - as  well as one or two theatrical trailers) and watching  &quot;Curse of the Blair Witch&quot; first before viewing the feature film.

It should probably have been released with a disclaimer: imagination is required. If you don't have one, you will find it tedious, annoying and boring. If you do, be prepared for a roller coaster.In conventional horror movies, you're constantly being shown glimpses of the villain, or monster, or evil presence, and usually by the end the evil has been revealed. The Blair Witch Project doesn't work that way. Instead, it works off the idea that the mysterious noise off in the woods is scarier than what is actually making the noise. Each night, as the characters fall asleep, the noises get closer, eerier, more menacing. You sense an evil presence closing in on them, but it's never identified. Try as they might, the characters can't find their way out of the woods. Each night, the inevitable darkness descends, and they wait, like forlorn prey, knowing that they will be targets once again for whatever wickedness stalks them in the night.The idea to shoot the film entirely with handheld cameras carried by the actors themselves is what makes this movie work. You see and experience everything from their perspective. When they get lost, you feel their anxiety, when darkness approaches, you experience their hopelessness, when they get frightened, and your body physically reacts as if the horror is in the room with you. If this movie were shot any other way, it would not be anywhere near as effective.Many negative things have been said about Heather Donahue, but I thought she did an outstanding job. She played her character perfectly. She showed more depth and emotion in this role than the vast majority of actresses out there today. She played it real too, and she wasn't afraid to be vulnerable, to appear bitchy, to have snot running down her nose, to scream her ass off when frightened beyond belief. This Heather-bashing needs to be put to rest. In many ways, she is the film. Her companions were great, because they really reflect the audience's reactions to her and the situation. Mike was a trip. His expressions and little quips provide much-needed comic relief early in the film.You really have to admire what these people did on a budget of only $35-$40,000. I've said it before, it's easy to throw millions of dollars at a project, but it takes real talent, creativity and intelligence to come up with an economical way of making it work. The fact that these people made what is arguably one of the most original and scariest horror movies of the last 20 years on a fraction of a fraction of what Hollywood spends on most movies is just amazing.

469507,AMAUNA0COWM9,6305568901,Jason Williams,"[2, 3]","First off...I find it amusing that so many people(mostly under the age of 25) actually believe that this movie was somehow based upon a true story. I hate to be the one to burst the bubble (not really), but not one shred of this movie has any real life parallels. Yep, it was all cooked up by the cast/crew. Just visit any number of urban legend sites on the web to verify this. Its not even based upon a local folklore legend (it was also fabricated)a facet that, if existed I believe would have made the movie a lot better.Now to the review. First off this movie, when I saw it in the theatre, made me dizzy. So much that I almost wanted to throw up. The DVD version is less traumatic. The main problem I have here is with the plot. You basically have two plot lines running simulatneously in this movie. Which one you adhere to depends upon your ability to suspend reality and to what degree. The first I will call the logical plot and it basically boils down to three stupid ... going out on a weekend hiking trip to shoot a documentary on a local ghost legend - sans any remote skills in map/compass reading or wilderness survival. The three run afoul of a rather sizable satanic cult and are picked off one by one in ritualistic fashion.The second one is the metaphysical plot line and has the basic  elements of the afforementioned plot but the antagonist is the ""Blair Witch"" a flat, inconcievable ""spirit being"" that sadistically toys with the three goofballs killing them one by one until its macabre pleasures are satisfied(when their all dead).This movie had tremendous potential, but failed on numerous fronts. First off I had no sympathy for any of the victims. I keep trying to imagine myself in the movie as a cast member when I watch this. Let me tell you that I, for one, would have helped the cult/witch out a bit when I discovered that the one screwball cast member threw away the map. At that point I would have kicked him in the nuts, bashed his head in with a rock, and left him for fodder. Also, the film would have been cut short and probably never been ""produced"" because at the point when the taller guy was pleading with the stupid girl to please stop recording their traumatic emotional dramas, hey - no negotiations. I would have wrestled the camcorder away from her and slammed it against the nearest tree.And whats with not being able to read a simple topo map with a compass? Its not that hard.1. First establish your position on the map(something they had numerous opportunity to do earlier on in the film).2. Find north with the compass, place the map on the ground with the North arrow oriented in the same direction as the compass's N arrow then ""draw"" a line from the center of the compass to where you want to go.3. Hold that bearing until you get there.Hey, I know that this was the Clinton presidency and all but I'd bet that any of the characters would have openly welcomed a ""bigot-homophobe"" Boy Scout - any of whom I know could have gotten them out of this situation in a matter of hours.I was raised in the outdoors and I know that I would have an obvious advantage over these three if placed in a similar situation, but come on, at some point in the film I was almost cheering for them to get killed because I was so disgusted with their lack of any kind of logical assessment or decisionmaking.The movie is unconvincing in that it does not provide a ""bridge"" between the two plot lines - you either follow one or the other, but are not drawn into both as it should be. An example of this would be some unexplainable ""freak' of reality such as when the cast inadvertently ends up back at the stream where they were previously ( I wont get in to how streams don't travel in circles and if you follow them(downslope)they travel towards and merge with larger streams - most of which people eventually build something by)and they are say - on the WRONG side of the stream! A friend of mine argued that this WAS the case in the film but after I watched it again - nope theyre on the side their supposed to be on - wishful thinking on his part I guess.In summation,  the fact is that there is nothing in this film that is not in some way explainable and the ""Blair Witch"" seems to be a metaphor created by the characters to describe events happening to them that are being perpetrated by unremarkable ""real world"" beings (demented people). That in itself is scary but the allusion to the supernatural is simultaneously unbelievable and distracting.",2,Not what it was cracked up to be,1058659200,"07 20, 2003",2003,4489,"['First', 'find', 'amusing', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'mostly', 'age', '25', 'actually', 'believe', 'movie', 'was', 'somehow', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'hate', 'be', 'one', 'burst', 'bubble', 'not', 'really', 'not', 'one', 'shred', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'parallels', 'Yep', 'was', 'cooked', 'up', 'cast/crew', 'Just', 'visit', 'number', 'urban', 'legend', 'sites', 'web', 'verify', 'not', 'even', 'based', 'local', 'folklore', 'legend', 'was', 'also', 'fabricated', 'facet', 'existed', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'lot', 'better.Now', 'review', 'First', 'movie', 'when', 'saw', 'theatre', 'made', 'dizzy', 'So', 'much', 'almost', 'wanted', 'throw', 'up', 'DVD', 'version', 'less', 'traumatic', 'main', 'problem', 'have', 'here', 'plot', 'basically', 'have', 'two', 'plot', 'lines', 'running', 'simulatneously', 'movie', 'one', 'adhere', 'depends', 'ability', 'suspend', 'reality', 'what', 'degree', 'first', 'will', 'call', 'logical', 'plot', 'basically', 'down', 'three', 'stupid', 'going', 'out', 'weekend', 'hiking', 'trip', 'shoot', 'documentary', 'local', 'ghost', 'legend', 'sans', 'remote', 'skills', 'map/compass', 'reading', 'wilderness', 'survival', 'three', 'run', 'afoul', 'rather', 'sizable', 'satanic', 'cult', 'are', 'picked', 'one', 'one', 'ritualistic', 'fashion.The', 'second', 'one', 'metaphysical', 'plot', 'line', 'basic', 'elements', 'afforementioned', 'plot', 'antagonist', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'flat', 'inconcievable', 'spirit', 'being', 'sadistically', 'three', 'goofballs', 'killing', 'one', 'one', 'macabre', 'pleasures', 'are', 'satisfied', 'when', 'dead', '.This', 'movie', 'had', 'tremendous', 'potential', 'failed', 'numerous', 'fronts', 'First', 'had', 'sympathy', 'victims', 'keep', 'trying', 'imagine', 'movie', 'cast', 'member', 'when', 'watch', 'Let', 'tell', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'cult/witch', 'out', 'bit', 'when', 'discovered', 'one', 'screwball', 'cast', 'member', 'threw', 'away', 'map', 'point', 'would', 'have', 'kicked', 'nuts', 'bashed', 'head', 'rock', 'left', 'fodder', 'Also', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'short', 'probably', 'never', 'been', 'produced', 'point', 'when', 'taller', 'guy', 'was', 'pleading', 'stupid', 'girl', 'please', 'stop', 'recording', 'traumatic', 'emotional', 'dramas', 'hey', 'negotiations', 'would', 'have', 'wrestled', 'camcorder', 'away', 'slammed', 'nearest', 'tree.And', 'whats', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'read', 'simple', 'topo', 'map', 'compass', 'not', 'hard.1', 'First', 'establish', 'position', 'map', 'something', 'had', 'numerous', 'opportunity', 'do', 'earlier', 'film', '.2', 'Find', 'north', 'compass', 'place', 'map', 'ground', 'North', 'arrow', 'oriented', 'same', 'direction', 'compass', 'N', 'arrow', 'then', 'draw', 'line', 'center', 'compass', 'where', 'want', 'go.3', 'Hold', 'bearing', 'get', 'there.Hey', 'know', 'was', 'Clinton', 'presidency', ""'d"", 'bet', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'openly', 'welcomed', 'bigot-homophobe', 'Boy', 'Scout', 'whom', 'know', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'situation', 'matter', 'hours.I', 'was', 'raised', 'outdoors', 'know', 'would', 'have', 'obvious', 'advantage', 'three', 'placed', 'similar', 'situation', 'come', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'almost', 'cheering', 'get', 'killed', 'was', 'so', 'disgusted', 'lack', 'kind', 'logical', 'assessment', 'decisionmaking.The', 'movie', 'unconvincing', 'not', 'provide', 'bridge', 'two', 'plot', 'lines', 'follow', 'one', 'other', 'are', 'not', 'drawn', 'should', 'be', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'unexplainable', 'freak', 'reality', 'such', 'when', 'cast', 'inadvertently', 'up', 'back', 'stream', 'where', 'were', 'previously', 'wont', 'get', 'how', 'streams', 'do', ""n't"", 'travel', 'circles', 'follow', 'downslope', 'travel', 'towards', 'merge', 'larger', 'streams', 'most', 'people', 'eventually', 'build', 'something', 'are', 'say', 'WRONG', 'side', 'stream', 'friend', 'mine', 'argued', 'WAS', 'case', 'film', 'watched', 'again', 'nope', 'theyre', 'side', 'supposed', 'be', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'part', 'guess.In', 'summation', 'fact', 'nothing', 'film', 'not', 'way', 'explainable', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'be', 'metaphor', 'created', 'characters', 'describe', 'events', 'happening', 'are', 'being', 'perpetrated', 'unremarkable', 'real', 'world', 'beings', 'demented', 'people', 'scary', 'allusion', 'supernatural', 'simultaneously', 'unbelievable', 'distracting']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

Munson,"[1, 1]","On a chilly fall morning, three ametur filmmakers (Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard, and Michael Williams) set off in search of the Blair Witch.  The legend states that a supernatural force is haunting the woods surrounding the town of Burkittsville, Maryland.  The filmmakers believe that its the spirit of the witch.  After gathering their gear and doing some interviews with local residents, they set off into the woods to find the witch.  What happens next can only be described as several days of sheer terror.  Strange occurrances start taking place at night.  Small piles of rocks are piled outside of the tent, but no one knows where they came from. Meanwhile, Mike reveals that he threw the group's map of the woods into the creek.  Frustration and panic sets in as the group realizes they are now hopelessly lost.  Morale in the group deteriorates, hunger sets in, and fights among the group start.  At night, terror fills the darkness in the form of voices and other creepy noises.  By day, the group tries vainly to escape from their self-inflicted prison.  Ultimately, they find out that they are no longer filming a spirit, but their own struggle to survive.This is a genuinely scary movie.  It is not typical blood and gore, but psychological terror.  One critic who reviewed this movie called it ""Scary as Hell""; I agree.  Watch and see for yourself.

So  simplistic,it's brilliant.I was cynical about this movie for obvious  reasons,but after all the hype dies down,i have to admit that this is a  truly chilling movie that gave me nightmares.From the opening scene that  tells you it's found footage you will be seeing,to the final frame,i was  anxious and uneasy.This is guerrila filmaking at it's best,and i hope there  are more films of this sort in the future.Highly recommended if you don't  need stunning visuals,sfx,creepy music,blood and guts,and the final  showdown with the unknown evil to entertain you.A personal favorite,and  what i consider an instant classic.",5,A film that reflects the performers attitude at the time.,965865600,"08 10, 2000",2000,2597,"['First', 'time', 'filmmakers', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'noticed', 'will', 'use', 'trick', 'book', 'get', 'attention', 'Hollywood', 'number', 'distributers.So', 'makers', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'knew', 'would', 'have', 'create', 'film', 'was', 'distinguished', 'rest.No', 'music', 'special', 'fx', 'invincible', 'mass', 'murderers', 'nudity', 'sex', 'etc', 'probably', 'realized', 'even', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'so', 'order', 'get', 'authentic', 'performances', 'actors/actress', ""would'nt"", 'set', 'up', 'scenes', 'traditional', 'sense', 'give', 'waypoints', 'follow', 'woods', 'keep', 'guessing', 'whole', 'time', 'what', 'expect', 'next.They', 'were', 'totally', 'clueless', 'what', 'fate', 'was', 'befall', 'result', 'audience', 'certain', 'extent', 'was', 'experiencing', 'identifying', 'confusion', 'horror', 'most', 'likely', 'were', 'scared', 'real.Imagine', 'agreeing', 'go', 'woods', 'guys', 'who', 'say', 'making', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'hiding', 'entire', 'time', 'terrrorizing', '8', 'days', 'nights.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'why', 'three', 'performers', 'agreed', 'something', 'i', 'feel', 'was', 'desperation', 'sense', 'desperation', 'combined', 'genuine', 'fear', 'unknown', 'part', 'what', 'truly', 'film', 'resonate.They', 'were', 'struggling', 'actors/actresses', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'noticed', 'frustration', 'was', 'conveyed', 'performances.There', 'were', 'two', 'scenes', 'illustrate', 'point.Heather', 'when', 'asked', 'why', 'kept', 'filming', 'even', 'were', 'lost', 'quot', 'i', 'have', 'quot', '.Mike', 'when', 'told', 'Heather', 'still', 'lost', 'constantly', 'reassuring', 'were', ""n't"", '.If', 'pay', 'attention', 'explanations', 'legend', 'beginning', 'film', ""'ll"", 'see', 'everything', 'woods', 'leading', 'up', 'something', 'foreshadowing', 'demise.Even', 'witch', 'obvious', 'suspect', 'was', 'left', 'open', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'anything', 'So', 'simplistic', 'brilliant.I', 'was', 'cynical', 'movie', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'hype', 'down', 'i', 'have', 'admit', 'truly', 'chilling', 'movie', 'gave', 'opening', 'scene', 'found', 'footage', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'final', 'frame', 'i', 'was', 'anxious', 'uneasy.This', 'guerrila', 'filmaking', 'best', 'i', 'hope', 'are', 'more', 'films', 'sort', 'future.Highly', 'recommended', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'sfx', 'creepy', 'music', 'blood', 'guts', 'final', 'showdown', 'unknown', 'evil', 'entertain', 'you.A', 'personal', 'favorite', 'what', 'i', 'consider', 'instant', 'classic']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

When she gets to the part where the poet opens his door to find ""...darkness there, and nothing more...""  Bart chimes in ""You know what's scarier than nothing?...ANYTHING!!"".  My point? I wish the creators of ""The Blair Witch Project"" were Simpsons fans.  I understand the idea that ""less is more"" can work well in horror films.  Hitchcock was a master of the concept, and even mediocre monster films don't show the creature for at least the first half of the movie.  But a corollary (sp?) to ""less is more"", could be ""nothing is still nothing"", and that's just about what ""The Blair Witch Project"" offers.  To be more accurate, it's hard to care whether there is somthing out there or not after 70 minutes of 3 people walking in circles swearing at each other.  There are some nighttime scenes that approach being mildly creepy, but then the sun comes up, and the foul-mouthed wanderings begin again, with no promise of any attack by a blair witch, serial killer, or hungry cougar to end the pointless trek.  In addition to these problems, one has to remember a throwaway line of dialogue from early in the film to understand the ending, if one even cares by then.

Like the UPN program, it struck me as odd that these three people, who are  lost in the woods and in what appears to be grave danger, had the presence  of mind to film and videotape everything.  Even combat photographers will  stop filming if they are in mortal danger.  When they went into the house  at the end, a camera would have been the last thing I would have  brought.The movie spent too much time showing the three  &quot;students&quot; walking around in the woods and screaming the f-word  more times than a gangsta rap CD.

469540,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,6305568901,Joker,"[2, 5]","This ""movie"" is a ""documentary"" about the so-called Blair witch legend.  It was marketed and hyped up as a true story, that three teenagers went into the woods in search of the Blair witch in October 1994 and never returned.  Then their camcorder footage was found a year later.The whole idea behind this movie was to scare its audience with the concept of making the audience get frightened of things they don't see.  It's called psychological horror.  Other horror movies of the past have accomplished this goal.  The Haunting (1963) is a perfect example.  The Haunting was a professionally made movie with a musical score, the whole nine yards.  In contrast, The Blair Witch Project was filmed with a camcorder and a shakey one at that.  There is no music in the film.  It's raw.  It has a skeletal budget.  It has the sounds of the day and the sounds of the night and the sounds of profane teenagers.  It's basically a ""reality"" film about some teens who are lost in the woods in search of a legendary witch that supposedly lives there.  The fact that they're looking for a witch and lost at the same time makes them increasingly frightened and frustrated as the movie progresses.The main problem I have with this film is that the footage is so shakey and amateur-ish.  This movie is unwatchable.  It'll make you dizzy and give you a headache.  It's fine to use a camcorder.  I thought it was a unique way to film a documentary ""movie"".  But at least make the footage watchable.  I can understand the camera shaking at times when the kids are running away from something that's scaring them, but to have shakey footage when they're just sitting around and talking or when planning their trip is really inexcusable.  If I want to watch really bad and I mean REALLY bad and shakey camcorder footage, I can watch any one of the countless lame and shakey videos that people I know have made throughout the years.  I don't know what's so hard about keeping a steady camera.  This film would have been better if the camerawork was better.  Instead of feeling scared, I found myself being distracted by the terrible camerawork and feeling dizzy with a headache, also.  The bad camerawork robbed me of any scared feeling I was supposed to have when watching this film.I think that if everyone who saw this film in 1999 would have known from the beginning that this film's story was not true, it wouldn't have drawn the crowds that it did.  There was a brilliant marketing campaign for this film and it worked.  Normally I'd give this film 1 star, but I'm adding an additional star for its unique approach and the fact that the marketing ploy made the makers of this film $ millions.  Again, it would be a better film had the camerawork been better.",2,There's nothing worse than shakey camcorder footage,1268784000,"03 17, 2010",2010,2744,"['movie', 'documentary', 'so-called', 'Blair', 'witch', 'legend', 'was', 'marketed', 'hyped', 'up', 'true', 'story', 'three', 'teenagers', 'went', 'woods', 'search', 'Blair', 'witch', 'October', '1994', 'never', 'returned', 'Then', 'camcorder', 'footage', 'was', 'found', 'year', 'later.The', 'whole', 'idea', 'movie', 'was', 'scare', 'audience', 'concept', 'making', 'audience', 'get', 'frightened', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'called', 'psychological', 'horror', 'Other', 'horror', 'movies', 'past', 'have', 'accomplished', 'goal', 'Haunting', '1963', 'perfect', 'example', 'Haunting', 'was', 'professionally', 'made', 'movie', 'musical', 'score', 'whole', 'nine', 'yards', 'contrast', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'was', 'filmed', 'camcorder', 'shakey', 'one', 'music', 'film', 'raw', 'skeletal', 'budget', 'sounds', 'day', 'sounds', 'night', 'sounds', 'profane', 'teenagers', 'basically', 'reality', 'film', 'teens', 'who', 'are', 'lost', 'woods', 'search', 'legendary', 'witch', 'supposedly', 'there', 'fact', ""'re"", 'looking', 'witch', 'lost', 'same', 'time', 'increasingly', 'frightened', 'frustrated', 'movie', 'progresses.The', 'main', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'footage', 'so', 'shakey', 'amateur-ish', 'movie', 'unwatchable', ""'ll"", 'make', 'dizzy', 'give', 'headache', 'fine', 'use', 'camcorder', 'thought', 'was', 'unique', 'way', 'film', 'documentary', 'movie', 'least', 'make', 'footage', 'watchable', 'can', 'understand', 'camera', 'shaking', 'times', 'when', 'kids', 'are', 'running', 'away', 'something', 'scaring', 'have', 'shakey', 'footage', 'when', ""'re"", 'just', 'sitting', 'around', 'talking', 'when', 'planning', 'trip', 'really', 'inexcusable', 'want', 'watch', 'really', 'bad', 'mean', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'shakey', 'camcorder', 'footage', 'can', 'watch', 'one', 'countless', 'lame', 'shakey', 'videos', 'people', 'know', 'have', 'made', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'so', 'hard', 'keeping', 'steady', 'camera', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'camerawork', 'was', 'better', 'Instead', 'feeling', 'scared', 'found', 'being', 'distracted', 'terrible', 'camerawork', 'feeling', 'dizzy', 'headache', 'also', 'bad', 'camerawork', 'robbed', 'scared', 'feeling', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'when', 'watching', 'film.I', 'think', 'everyone', 'who', 'saw', 'film', '1999', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'beginning', 'film', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'true', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'drawn', 'crowds', 'did', 'was', 'brilliant', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'film', 'worked', 'Normally', ""'d"", 'give', 'film', '1', 'star', ""'m"", 'adding', 'additional', 'star', 'unique', 'approach', 'fact', 'marketing', 'ploy', 'made', 'makers', 'film', 'millions', 'Again', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'camerawork', 'been', 'better']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS
469541,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,6305568901,Jonathan Appleseed,"[2, 6]","I had an interesting and fairly unique experience with this film. Bear with me through a little background explanation so that you'll understand.I'm hard of hearing, with no hearing in my right ear at all, and only 25% in my left. If you've ever seen someone in the theaters wearing headsets, that's someone like me. I wear headsets because although I have a hearing aid that works very well in normal situations, it doesn't help in movies. The headsets are specialized to assist with the comprehension of dialogue. Without them, I would be absolutely lost. The number of films I misunderstood, or had new meaning added once I watched them on video with closed captioning (Angel Heart is one) are legion. The Blair Witch Project falls into that category.In the theater, I had a very difficult time understanding the dialogue in the ""interviews"". The sound quality throughout the movie is generally poor, and that's intentional, as it's supposed to be a very cheap documentary. This means that I missed out on some pretty important explanations of the serial killer of children and the Blair Witch herself, and didn't realize that they were separate entities. Also, once things started going south (no pun intended) in the woods, I hadn't the slightest idea what was going on. I didn't hear any twigs snapping at night outside their tent, cackling, and I certainly didn't hear any children's voices as the tent was being pummeled, the scene which led Heather to run away from the tent and after something that she saw. So when the final scene arrived, this magnificent denouement that the Amazon description speaks of, I was completely lost. I left the theater thinking that this was the stupidest piece of garbage I had ever seen.Months later, when it came out on video, I decided to give it another shot thinking that perhaps I had missed something. And when I got the closed captions going, I found out that I did. I learned that there was 1) the Blair Witch, and 2) the serial killer of children. I heard snapping at night outside the tent and realized that there were children's voices haunting them at night - all of the things I missed in the film due partly to my hearing problem, but mostly to the poor sound quality. This time, even though I knew the ending, the denouement terrified me. I'm not easily frightened, and when I turned the lights off that night, there was a good ten minutes of discomfort before I finally fell asleep. That feeling stayed with me for several weeks.Of course I immediately rented The Curse of the Blair Witch. Most people I talk to that hated the movie (and they are numerous) felt so because they didn't really understand what was going on, and the ending, therefore, meant nothing to them. In The Curse of the Blair Witch, we learn much more about the actual witch and the serial killer, who claimed to have been haunted by the witch, and blamed her haunting of him for his murders. At first I thought this additional information was ""cool"", but as I thought on it I realized that many people I had discussed the film with didn't like it because they didn't understand the ending. ""Mike's in the corner? Big deal! What does that have to do with the Blair Witch?"" Well, as we learn, it has everything to do with it. And this information should have been in the film, not in a mockumentary.

The Blair Witch Project is a film that will scare you if you let your imagination run wild...I really enjoyed the intro where they speak to the locals about the Blair Witch; the tales are creepy and effective, and they feel authentic. Now, the group enter the woods and eventually get lost. This is the scariest part of the film for me; imagine getting lost in the woods that are supposed to be haunted and having your mind play tricks on you; it's truly a chilling concept. You don't actually see anything in this film, but you hear the screams of the actors. This is where it may be a problem; if your not immersed into the film, you may not be able to effectively use your imagination. The film doesn't have much tension, either, so it may not immerse you at all. Another flaw in my opinion was Heather; her character is the illogical one that causes this whole situation by going into the woods pretending to know where they were you going, and she constantly tries to joke around which kills the mood/atmosphere especially when she wasn't really funny. If they balanced her dialogue (espescially her fooling around) and decisions, this would've been a lot better. Other illogical decisions would be (slight spoiler) purposely throwing the map into a river. The ending was redeeming for her character, Heather, and for the movie in general, though. The acting was all fine, including Heather's. Not much happens in this 1hr 20min film though.Overall, the ""lost in the woods"" concept is scary, and the ending was great, but not much happens to really scare you throughout.

This is a film with no scripts, not real actors, and no cheap props.  Three college students are lost in the woods  shooting a documentary about the Blair Witch.  Everything that we can see  comes from the lense of their two cameras.  We never see anything exept  that.  And that is the beauty of the film, it' simplicity.  This is a film  that works so well, and can never be duplicated successfully.  The best  part of this film is that the reactions the actors display are real.  This  film is impovisation, like I said, NO SCRIPTS.  The actors are really in  the woods, and are being terrorized by the director and his crew.  The DVD  features are excellent.

I'm not big on scary, most movies don't creep me out or disturb me anymore. I watch horror films because they can be entertaining...Or can at least be able to jolt you. This film somehow manages to be entertaining and not scary, but disturbing. I didn't find this movie disturbing however until the final scene where the remaining characters meet their end at the hands of an unseen killer. This part, although brief and with a complete lack of information, was slightly disturbing. It makes you think. But, anyways, as far as I know...The whole Blair Witch thing is a true myth, but this movie is not real. Although it's kind of billed as a true story. You know the whole ""In October of 1994, three studen filmmakers disappeared...Etc."" I think this works and the way the film is shot, which means completely with a handheld camera which gives it a look of realism is good. The movie is about three student filmmakers namedHeather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams (which, to help with realism, is the actors real names) go into the woods of Burkittsville, Maryland to investigate the legend of The Blair Witch. Once they get into the woods, tempers flare and they eventually get lost. But weird stuff begins to happen, while they sleep something is outside the tent and ritualistic figures are found outside...Piles of rocks used at a burial ground, the stickman things in the trees. Bunch of weird crap. Anyway, as the story moves along, they realize that they will not make it out alive and just by reading the synopsis on the back, that should be obvious. I'm not sure how this movie turned out to be good, when the real payoff isn't until the last 30 seconds of the film. That means over 70 minutes of movie is pacing, but the characters and dialouge seem so real I'm inclined to think it's improved. The way the characters talk is almost exactly how people talk in real life; stuttering, repeating themselves, getting agitated, etc. Anyway, if it's Friday and you want to rent a horror movie that has a lot of blood and violence. This movie isn't for you. But, if you want a semi-effective movie that uses the unseen and the unheard to disturb you, you should like this. Any person who has an appreciation for film, since this movie was pretty original in the ways of filming and such at the time, should see this as well.GRADE: A-",5,"The End is the Most Disturbing, But Not the Scariest Movie Ever...",1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,2557,"['know', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'countless', 'parodies', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Scary', 'Hell', 'One', 'Creepiest', 'Films', 'Exorcist', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'scary', 'most', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'creep', 'out', 'disturb', 'anymore', 'watch', 'horror', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'entertaining', 'can', 'least', 'be', 'able', 'jolt', 'film', 'somehow', 'be', 'entertaining', 'not', 'scary', 'disturbing', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'however', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'remaining', 'characters', 'meet', 'end', 'hands', 'unseen', 'killer', 'part', 'brief', 'complete', 'lack', 'information', 'was', 'slightly', 'disturbing', 'think', 'anyways', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'whole', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'thing', 'true', 'myth', 'movie', 'not', 'real', 'kind', 'billed', 'true', 'story', 'know', 'whole', 'October', '1994', 'three', 'studen', 'filmmakers', 'disappeared', 'Etc', 'think', 'works', 'way', 'film', 'shot', 'completely', 'handheld', 'camera', 'look', 'realism', 'good', 'movie', 'three', 'student', 'filmmakers', 'namedHeather', 'Donahue', 'Joshua', 'Leonard', 'Michael', 'Williams', 'help', 'realism', 'actors', 'real', 'names', 'go', 'woods', 'Burkittsville', 'Maryland', 'investigate', 'legend', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Once', 'get', 'woods', 'tempers', 'flare', 'eventually', 'get', 'lost', 'weird', 'stuff', 'happen', 'sleep', 'something', 'tent', 'ritualistic', 'figures', 'are', 'found', 'Piles', 'rocks', 'used', 'burial', 'ground', 'stickman', 'things', 'trees', 'Bunch', 'weird', 'crap', 'Anyway', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'realize', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'just', 'reading', 'synopsis', 'back', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'when', 'real', 'payoff', ""n't"", 'last', '30', 'seconds', 'film', '70', 'minutes', 'movie', 'pacing', 'characters', 'dialouge', 'seem', 'so', 'real', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'think', 'improved', 'way', 'characters', 'talk', 'almost', 'exactly', 'how', 'people', 'talk', 'real', 'life', 'stuttering', 'repeating', 'getting', 'agitated', 'etc', 'Anyway', 'Friday', 'want', 'rent', 'horror', 'movie', 'lot', 'blood', 'violence', 'movie', ""n't"", 'want', 'semi-effective', 'movie', 'unseen', 'unheard', 'disturb', 'should', 'like', 'Any', 'person', 'who', 'appreciation', 'film', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'original', 'ways', 'filming', 'such', 'time', 'should', 'see', 'well.GRADE', 'A-']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

Much like TITANIC, the hype that buzzed around this film turned a lot of people off and we can blame the media for turning this film into a ""monster"", drawing millions of people to see it when it was never intended to be a mainstream movie that would draw the kind of attention/criticism that it did. If this film had never been released in mainstream theatres or had been made 30 years ago, it would be a classic, beloved gem by devout horror fans. But because everyone expects 20 million dollar mega blockbuster films with special effects up the wazoo, this film got a really bad reputation as being low-budget, boring crap. Unfortunately, unless you are a real horror fan who CRAVES the filmmaking style of the 1970s and DESPISES the corporate Hollywood tradition of big budget blow-you-out-of-your-seat special effects, the beauty of Blair Witch will be lost on you.

Also, if you see some weird wooden shapes made of branches in the trees then you need to run away real fast. mom says they are NOT bird houses!

There are tons of other films that rely on the viewer using their imagination to move a story along that are so much better than this.  ""Signs"" never gives you a visual of the alien until well into the movie, but it works on your mind.  ""The Others"" has more twists and turns in it without special effects than ""The Blair Witch Project"" could muster in a film and a mockumentary.What I saw after viewing this film was something all too common in my Mass Communication classes in college:  hokey college-aged artsters hoping to make the next ""greatest film of all time"" and winding up with a silly, boring, and downright dumb film.  There is nothing scary about this film.  Sight-gags(like the stickmen totem thingies) and noises only go so far in a bad horror flick such as this one, and the whole ""recovered video tape"" idea is nothing groundbreaking.Oh, and before anybody accuses me of being one of those folks who consider a scary movie to be one of those flicks that has the most gore or special effects, you're wrong.  Those movies are pure popcorn fluff.  They don't come after you in an attempt to be scary.  They know they aren't scary, just full of eye-candy.  They ENTERTAIN the viewer.  ""Blair Witch"" lovers don't seem to be able to grasp that concept.The really scary thing about this movie is how it suckered so many people into believing that it is the greatest movie around.  That's the real masterpiece of this pile of dog poo.  The producers knew that they didn't have a winner on their hands, so they concocted a whole history for this flick and plopped it onto the internet where folks ate it up like candy.  For that reason alone, I'm giving this one two stars.  It shows just how gullible people can be.  If you keep repeating something, it's bound to become true.

469575,A3SG59KJLAQOPG,6305568901,K. Good,"[5, 10]","I'll give Blair Witch credit for approaching the horror film genre with a much more subtle and minimalistic hand than other recent monstrosities like the remake of ""The Haunting.""  The film makers tried to convey terror in the way we most get terrified, with unclear and dimly understood phenomena that subtly take us to a slightly scrambled and foreboding frame of reference, with a menacing force we feel is out to get us but which we cannot clearly define. No 20-foot high apparations growling at us, no human bones exploding out of the fireplace.So Blair Witch tries to make you think this could really happen to people, since it was ""filmed as someone's project"" (as the pre-release hype led us to believe).  But somehow, it all just falls flat.  For me there were two key problems, one of which was the believability of the presumed realism.  For example, we have this group of obviously inexpert hikers with a questionable sense of direction, taking a trip into very unfamiliar territory (territory which is purported to have claimed human lives before), with absolutely no contingency in case they get lost.  One stinking map.... no cheap Radio Shack GPS unit, and for crying out loud, in a world where young people possess cell phones in abundance, no one thought to bring one!  ""Hello... we are WAY lost here, and something's trying to kill us.... SEND HELP!""OK, if I accept that they are just a bunch of young foul-ups, am I to accept that they have to get so irrational and out of control that they spend half the film screaming and cursing at one another (yeah, I know, ""the witch"" was influencing them) that they not only failed to stick to any coherent plan to get them out of the woods, one of them actually throws that one map away out of spite?Somehow, with their brain-dead approach to what they were trying to do, and the incessant carping and yelling at each other, I just couldn't connect with any of them.  In fact, I found them to become so annoying I was waiting with hopeful anticipation to seeing ""the witch"" deal them their just desserts!Yes, it's clear the film was done VERY cheaply, and the acting is, IMO, amateurish.

469581,AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L,6305568901,"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip""","[30, 35]","First, I feel like I have to address the buzz surrounding the movie. I am at the same time disgusted and sort of impressed with the hype. It is pretty clever when you think about it.  No trailers (well, they did have some eventually, but still, it took them long enough) no cast members doing the rounds on talk shows, no big budget, etc. Just the website, the documentary on the SciFi channel, and big-time word of mouth. Apparently worked. I feel for those actors, since they got paid about what I make in 2 weeks for 3 weeks of hell. I hope to God the filmmakers were generous and gave them points in the film.I am also hearing that at most theaters, they pay the manager, etc to get up before the showing and get the crowd all hyped up, which is kind of lame. When we saw it Saturday, the owner (before she threatened people who had laser pointers) got up and yelled, &quot;Hey, welcome to Crossroads theater, and ARE YA READY FOR THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT?  Whooooo-hoooo!  Everyone READY TO BE SCARED?&quot; I was like, oh please. I also heard these girls in front of me asking someone next to them if **this was a real documentary**. We got up and moved because I did not want to spend the movie sitting behind someone so incredibly stupid and naive. But I guess that's what a good job they did marketing it, because I heard there are plenty of stupid people out there who think the thing is real. I also grudgingly admire whoever decided to market it initially as a 'hard ticket', meaning they wanted to have it only at one theater or so per city for a few weeks. I'm sure that helped the buzz.  Hyping it as the scariest movie of all time (though maybe this is more word of mouth than the filmmakers doing it) is kind of dumb, though, because people are just going to be disappointed, unless all they've seen are &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;. I heard kids talking after the movie who were let down because they was very little gore, no monster, and no real pay-off.I had a good time because I told myself not to expect anything. I guess if you go, just keep an open mind, and don't think, &quot;This better be the scariest movie of all time after all the hype, or I'll be p**sed&quot;. I do think it's kind of funny how the big studios spend millions of dollars marketing their lame summer 'event' pics, but this is the one most people are talking about wanting to see.So, that's my 2 cents as far as the hype goes. Went and saw BWP for myself a few weeks after in came out.  Inside the theater manager had to come make an announcement about laser pointers, she said if anyone used them during the movie she'd take them away and kick them out. She was this huge, burly, tough woman who looked like a prison warden so people calmed down after that and shut up. Anyway, I loved it. Not the scariest movie I've ever seen, but if you asked me what the scariest movie I've ever seen was, I wouldn't be able to name it. I would saw BWP, the Exorcist, Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer, Last House on the Left (and a couple more I can't think of right now) are like the top scariest. I was really impressed though. Very realistic, the way it was shot and put together, and the character's reactions to stuff. My spouse said it really scared him, which he hardly ever says, because he's been camping and that's like your worst nightmare. The whole movie was very creepy and spooky but the last 5 minutes REALLY scared the crap out of me.It's funny, the audience started out very rowdy, and I thought I'd have to &quot;shhh&quot; people the whole movie. But after the first 5 minutes, people were engrossed. As the film got more and more tense and scary, there were no screams. Instead, the whole audience just sat there cowering quietly in fear. Not a lot of talking back to the screen, etc like there is in most horror movies, and the audience was full of teenagers. That speaks for itself, I think.I read a review in which they said that the movie was all about panic, and I agree. One of the most upsetting things is the way the characters go from calm, controlled, and joking, to nervously joking and then arguing, to trying desperately to hold it together, to understandable total freaked out panic by the last reel. As the film draws to a close they just give up all pretenses of composure and control and just panic and run around like maniacs screaming incoherently at the top of their lungs.

I think that is what made this movie.  It was done in such a fashion that made you think you were really watching these people get lost in the woods and having these eerie things happening to them at night. We did not see any witches or creatures or anything of that nature, we just heard wierd noises and activity and in the morning something odd was the result, such as finding the piles of rocks surrounding the campsite that were not there the night before.  Sometimes what you don't see can be scarier then what you do see.  The acting was excellent, the characters were real and convincing.  I felt the way the three dealt with each other and thier indivdual reactions to thier desperate situation seemed very geninue, like it could have happened that way.  It was a very unique idea to do a film in this fashion.I just have one problem with this movie.  You would think that when they found the stream or river that they would just follow it out the of woods.  They interviewed a man fishing at the beggining so you know that river would eventually lead the way home.  Granted that could have been a different river but who cares.  I would rather try that then walk through the woods with no sense of where I am headed, that compass was useless along with the map that one of the characters tossed.  One might agrue, the ""same log"" theory in which they walked in one direction all day and ended up at the same point, as if the ""mystical powers"" of the woods and the ""witch"" were keeping them hostage and not allowing them to leave, and that following the river would not have mattered, and would explain why the map and compass were useless.

The hype itself was moderately clever, and would get three stars from me. (In the same way that Madonna's media manipulation always used to be more interesting than her act.) But I just saw the film. It is boring and irritating beyond belief. I regret that the horror is understated principally because the cast are so irritating. By the time they have shouted, thrown tantrums, run in terror from things that seem, at worst, mildly puzzling and more commonly not interesting at all, bickered and whined their full, I would happily have seen them chainsawed into small pieces, disembowelled by telekinesis, or indeed any fate that a better horror movie might have given them. They deserve bloody gurgling technicolour horror, as does everyone involved in this tedious project. There is no noise, including a railway whistle, that has so relieved me by Stopping, at last, as the whining of these actors. If the Blair Witch herself had deigned to enliven this turkey by making a screen appearance, possibly also decapitating any of the main cast, or the producers, I think I would have fallen in love: I would have her name on my pencil case, simply for Stopping This Movie. But without her, it simply goes on for 85 interminable minutes. The cinematography, such as it was, consisted of spinning the camera around in the woods. Script and acting cannot be evaluating, since they didn't actually appear in this film. Truly a wretched, incompetent, valueless film.

My daughter and I saw this film when it was first released and, given its hype at the time, were inclined to think that it was no biggie. Well, we were wrong. My daughter was frightened out of her wits, and I must confess that I, too, was creeped out by this inventive and imaginative low budget film.Shot with hand held cameras, it is an ostensible would-be documentary filmed by three young adults on a backwoods Maryland legend called the Blair Witch. Shortly after filming some of the local yokels in Burkettsville (once known as the town of Blair), Maryland, our three intrepid filmmakers enter the woods where the witch did her dastardly deeds.Venturing ever deeper into the woods, what initially starts as a romp into local history slowly turns into a terror filled foray, where unknown entities nightly make spooky noises outside their campsite, leave behind cairns ostensibly built for each of them, and gelatinous deposits of an unknown origin are left on personal belongings. They also stumble upon an eerie site where a multitude of strange stick figures are found hanging oddly from trees. Lost in the woods, they stumble about these genuinely creepy woods, their fear ever escalating, as does that of the viewer.As these young filmmakers are never seen nor heard from again, what happened to them can only be gleaned from their unedited film footage that was found sometime after their disappearance.

The shaky camera work adds an air of authenticity to the film, though it is a bit of a dizzying prospect.Of course, there is no real Blair Witch Project, the film is a mock documentary, and the people in the films are just actors, but the directors, actors, and everyone involved in this film certainly understand the concept that less is more, turning in one of the spookiest, most original and inventive horror films ever to grace the silver screen.",5,SCARY...CREEPY...WEIRD...,1162771200,"11 6, 2006",2006,2056,"['film', 'one', 'hates', 'Well', 'am', 'former', 'category', 'daughter', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'given', 'hype', 'time', 'were', 'inclined', 'think', 'was', 'biggie', 'Well', 'were', 'wrong', 'daughter', 'was', 'frightened', 'wits', 'must', 'confess', 'too', 'was', 'creeped', 'out', 'inventive', 'imaginative', 'low', 'budget', 'film.Shot', 'hand', 'held', 'cameras', 'ostensible', 'would-be', 'documentary', 'filmed', 'three', 'young', 'adults', 'backwoods', 'Maryland', 'legend', 'called', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Shortly', 'filming', 'local', 'yokels', 'Burkettsville', 'once', 'known', 'town', 'Blair', 'Maryland', 'three', 'intrepid', 'filmmakers', 'enter', 'woods', 'where', 'witch', 'did', 'dastardly', 'deeds.Venturing', 'ever', 'deeper', 'woods', 'what', 'initially', 'romp', 'local', 'history', 'slowly', 'terror', 'filled', 'foray', 'where', 'unknown', 'entities', 'nightly', 'make', 'spooky', 'noises', 'campsite', 'leave', 'cairns', 'ostensibly', 'built', 'gelatinous', 'deposits', 'unknown', 'origin', 'are', 'left', 'personal', 'belongings', 'also', 'stumble', 'eerie', 'site', 'where', 'multitude', 'strange', 'stick', 'figures', 'are', 'found', 'hanging', 'oddly', 'trees', 'Lost', 'woods', 'stumble', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'woods', 'fear', 'ever', 'escalating', 'viewer.As', 'young', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'again', 'what', 'happened', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'gleaned', 'unedited', 'film', 'footage', 'was', 'found', 'sometime', 'disappearance', 'what', 'viewer', 'actually', 'watching', 'sort', 'cinema', 'verite', 'actually', 'film', 'film', 'shaky', 'camera', 'work', 'air', 'authenticity', 'film', 'bit', 'dizzying', 'prospect.Of', 'course', 'real', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'film', 'mock', 'documentary', 'people', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'actors', 'directors', 'actors', 'everyone', 'involved', 'film', 'certainly', 'understand', 'concept', 'less', 'more', 'turning', 'one', 'spookiest', 'most', 'original', 'inventive', 'horror', 'films', 'ever', 'grace', 'silver', 'screen']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

Not since Texas Chainsaw Massacre have I seen a movie that disturbed me with images and suggestions, and no blood.  If you allow  yourself to get into the movie, enjoy the characters and follow their  demise - you will love the movie.  Some great spontaneous humor, and the  realization that you are lost in a foreign wood is gripping.  The most  enjoyable aspect is the breakdown of the group social structure and the  breakdown of human decency...you get to see what it is like to skate on the  edge of lunacy - lost and hunted.  The paranormal evil is gripping as well.  I find the wails of a child in the woods in the dead of night even more  gripping than someone just leaping out and hacking them up...the terror is  there because it is the occult, and it reeks of more than a silly serial  killer or backwoods nut.There must be some suspension of  disbelief...yeah they would not use the cameras all the time (but you must  accept that as a viewer that the director needs to tell the story through  the cameras, so it is no big deal).  Why didn't they have a cell phone?  This story took place according to the makers, a while back, when cell  phones were not common and you must remember, these campers thought they  were going to be back within a day or two...not a tough hike, and a lot of  backwoods areas, cell phones did not work either.If you are into hype  you will be disappointed...if you are expecting cinematic brilliance, you  will be disappointed.  If you do not like character development and subtle  terror you will not like this film.  But...if you have ever been camping,  alone or with friends, in the backwoods, and you have ever woken up to a  far off cry, or seen something very eerie, this movie will play on that  till the end...and that is what makes this film great in my opinion.

Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.At the very beginning we learn that in October 1994 filmmaking students Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville (formerly known as Blair), Maryland while shooting a documentary. The topic of their film was a horrible crime committed in the 1940s by Rustin Parr, a deranged man who before his execution claimed he was forced to commit murder by the spirit of Elly Kedward, a woman hanged in the XVIII century after being accused of witchcraft. A year after their disappearance, their footage was found by police...When released in 1999 this film made certainly a big impact on the viewers and critics alike, mostly by its originality. The concept of ""found footage"" was actually used occasionally before, but none of such films was very good (well, with the exception of Belgian made ""Man Bite Dog"" from 1992, which kind of is a ""found footage"" film). This film on another hand is not only original but also good, mostly because of the quality of the story and of the work with camera. After watching it, it is easy to understand why this film propelled the whole ""found footage"" genre into the mainstream of Hollywodian cinema.It is however much more difficult to make a good ""found footage"" film than one can think and as result it was necessary to wait until 2007 to see another movie of this kind which would be of similar quality to ""Blair Witch Project"" - it was of course the first ""Paranormal Activity""... Since them some other films managed to do as well, especially ""Cloverfield"" and Norwegian ""Troll Hunter"" - but quite a lot of more failed to reach the same level of quality, like the initially very promising ""Apollo 18"".This film is not exactly a horror in the usual meaning of words as we never see what exactly threatens the three students lost in woods - but ultimately a cold chill creeps into this experience once we realize that leaving this darn cold wet forest is for humans as difficult as escaping a spider web when you are a fly... The more they struggle, the worse they trap themselves... And that kind of nightmare is always a pretty scary experience...I cannot say that this is a great masterpiece, but there is definitely something in this film which I never saw or felt before. With a very limited budget the unexperienced makers of ""Blair Witch Project"" managed to do a greatly original thing, cleverly disturbing and artistically successful. And that deserves five stars - not one less. Enjoy!",5,"""We are hungry, cold - and hunted. I'm scared to close my eyes, I'm scared to open them!

It's when they get lost trying to find their way back to the car that things start to get captivatingly gloomy. All the additional dread, the ""witch"" stuff, sort of goes against that fact. Being lost in the middle of nowhere, in the cold with a minimum amount of food and water, is scary enough. That alone should probably be the gist of the plot. Being taunted and haunted by evil spirits every night nears conceptual overkill; especially when one of your companions disappear, leaving just one other person between you and the kind of lonely dread that dominates nightmares.It's a movie, a fictional one presented as a set of real-life documentary-style video clips, but everything from the way the characters act to the brilliantly inane things they say seem almost too real to come out of just another horror script. In a sense, it is. The dialogue, all or most of it, is reportedly improvised, just as it would be if this wasn't just a movie. No, this Blair Witch Project isn't particularly scary, unless perhaps you actually believe in witchcraft, but it's quite a compelling character study. I suspect people like this would react like this in a situation like this. Nothing, aside from the actual ""witch"" part itself, seems unreal; particularly at the end when all hope is lost, fear takes over and the girl starts screaming for her life.marcellee.com",4,4 of 5,1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,1528,"['Three', 'filmmakers', 'travel', 'woods', 'Burkittsville', 'Maryland', 'investigate', 'folklore', 'local', 'witch', 'watching', 'blab', 'bicker', 'interesting', 'enough', 'when', 'get', 'lost', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'car', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'captivatingly', 'gloomy', 'additional', 'dread', 'witch', 'stuff', 'sort', 'fact', 'Being', 'lost', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'cold', 'minimum', 'amount', 'food', 'water', 'scary', 'enough', 'alone', 'should', 'probably', 'be', 'gist', 'plot', 'Being', 'taunted', 'haunted', 'evil', 'spirits', 'night', 'conceptual', 'overkill', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'companions', 'disappear', 'leaving', 'just', 'one', 'other', 'person', 'kind', 'lonely', 'dread', 'nightmares.It', 'movie', 'fictional', 'one', 'presented', 'set', 'real-life', 'documentary-style', 'video', 'clips', 'everything', 'way', 'characters', 'act', 'brilliantly', 'inane', 'things', 'say', 'seem', 'almost', 'too', 'real', 'come', 'just', 'horror', 'script', 'sense', 'dialogue', 'most', 'reportedly', 'improvised', 'just', 'would', 'be', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'movie', 'No', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'scary', 'perhaps', 'actually', 'believe', 'witchcraft', 'quite', 'compelling', 'character', 'study', 'suspect', 'people', 'would', 'react', 'situation', 'Nothing', 'aside', 'actual', 'witch', 'part', 'unreal', 'particularly', 'end', 'when', 'hope', 'lost', 'fear', 'girl', 'screaming', 'life.marcellee.com']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

After all, this was a student project that was presumably meant to be edited later, so why not get as much on camera as possible? Nothing happens, say some - but that's the point of this movie, your imagination supplies what isn't shown on the screen (perfect example - Heather running through the woods, screaming &quot;What was that?&quot; at something unseen).  Too much of the F-word, cry others - well, hate to burst your bubble, but a lot of young people talk this way, for better or worse; there is certainly nothing unrealistic about a lot of profanity.

Second, nice presentation, i.e., the menus and background screens.

In anticipation of this, the creators of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" perhaps drunk beyond measure, found a way to make it easier for everyone to believe the horror they were delivering.Before the movie goer even got to theater, he had been bombarded with television commercials, news clips and a meteor shower of Internet ads presenting the film as the true documentary gone awry and captured on film. They did it convincingly. But no amount of early hype could prepare the audience for the eerily authentic feel of what appears to be an amateur movie filmed by kids who stumble into something truly horrific.I love ""The Blair Witch Project"" because it never blinks. For the duration of the movie, you feel like you're experiencing a morbid, voyeuristic glimpse into the last days in the lives of these hapless adventurers. Throughout the movie is a pervasive sense of evil and danger, although the creators wisely never show you much of anything. The fear comes from noises in the woods, cryptic symbols that appear everywhere, the lingering uneasiness from legends about the woods in which these teenagers walk.When they become lost, you, the viewer feel lost as well. When their panic rises, so does your own. The often bouncing, jerky filming only adds to the realism and to the rising horror of the events unfolding.The movie provokes your mood and gives away only enough of the visuals. Was that a finger that poor girl found wrapped in tattered cloth? Or a tongue? Is everyone still together as they run through the woods on that night of terror? Or has what's-his-name been left behind at the tent? With this poor lighting and bouncing camera work, it's hard to tell.""Blair Witch"" is the kind of movie that will exhaust you. Muscles tense up early in the movie and they don't relax until you're far from the theater. The final scene of the movie is just... blech. Jarring, realistic and open to interpretation, the kind that will leave you stammering about it for the rest of the night.This is a movie that could do for camping what Jaws did for cool ocean swims.

It bespeaks of a worrying lack of imagination, and it is their loss. BWP is such a tremendously effective movie simply because it never spills the beans. There is no witch to be seen; for all you know by the end, there may be a perfectly natural (if not quite sane) explanation for the occurences that have come to pass. It is all in the eye of the beholder, and that is what makes this the one and only horror movie I ever saw that actually cost me a night of sleep. Even without the hype and the 'mockumentary', the build-up of suspense is almost unbearable. The realism of the acting, the unpreposessing and equally realistic medium of unsteady videoshots and 16mm film, and the oppressive monotony of the autumnal woods, set the mood in an incomparable way, and draw you in. By the time uncanny things start to happen, they are almost as unsettling to the viewer as they are to the three hapless students in their flimsy tent. Another great thing about this movie is that its impact does not diminish with repeated viewing - it's not one of those movies like The Sixth Sense or The Others that loose most of their appeal once you know the clue.The mocked up Blair Witch documentary is a treat in itself. It lends complexity and depth to the story, while at the same time displaying an amusing tongue-in-cheek sense of humor. In all, in a time when the Exorcist seems silly rather than scary, and plots that depend on a single clever twist have been done to death, this good old-fashioned ghost story is a godsend.

This was nothing but watching people in the woods crying and sniffiling with mucus hanging out their noses for almost 2 hours. I've seen home footage of kids birthday parties that had more suspense.

If you don't remotely know what is happening in a movie, you don't experience ultimate fear -- you get BORED.That's the problem with this movie - nothing happens in it. Nothing at all. It starts out with some &quot;interviews&quot; with local people about the Blair Witch. We learn that the Blair Witch used to be the Burkittsville Witch. This is ALL we learn in this approximately three hour period. Then Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Josh Leonard decide to wander around aimlessly in the forest, and immedietly get lost. They lose their map, swear a lot, and discover that one member of their group has erratic body hair. Then, one morning, as Heather exits their tent, she realizes that something is moving in a nearby bush. She moves closer, only to see that it is a small pile of rocks! But this small pile of rocks is angry, and it has a chainsaw! Heather runs away screaming into the woods, but the small pile of rocks chases after her, and Heather eventually (according to the laws of horror movies) trips on a tree branch, is inexplicably unable to get up, and is hacked to bits by the angry rock pile's chainsaw.I'm kidding. Having a pile of rocks attack someone with a chainsaw would be out of place in The Blair Witch Project, because it was the intent of the creative minds behind it to make a movie where literally nothing happens, and some rocks armed with a chainsaw constitutes &quot;something.&quot; I think I speak for all of us when I say a movie with &quot;things&quot; in it would be unacceptable.Heather, Michael, and Josh do see some rocks and run away from them screaming, though. They also encounter (run away screaming from) some evil sticks, a psychotic slime mold, and finally a particularly murderous pine cone. Then, they wander around, and after a while the movie ends. I think they died.Do not see this movie. Don't even watch it when it's on TV, it could turn out that you have a ratings box in your TV without knowing it and then YOU would be personally responsible for giving money to people who think sticks are scary.

469621,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305568901,Matthew Horner,"[4, 6]","A few years ago, two young guys, who had recently graduated from a little film school in Florida, decided to make a little movie. With help from friends and families, they came up with around $30,000 to make the movie. Luckily, they got this picture entered in a great big film festival, where a little company called Artisan Entertainment cut a good deal with the boys and got the rights to distribute the movie. The people at Artisan devised one of the best publicity campaigns in Hollywood history. And so it was that The Blair Witch Project went on to gross over $125,000,000 in North American theaters. The young guys, David Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez became legend. Better yet in some people's eyes, they and everybody at Artisan got rich. Only in America, as we like to say.I tell this story party because it's interesting, but mostly because the phenomenon that is The Blair Witch Project has thrown most logical attempt to discuss its merits as a movie into disarray. The problem is that, not since Easy Rider in the 1960s, have so many people seen a movie done on a shoestring. Many of these folks have said how original it is when compared to standard Hollywood fare. It is, but I wonder if that would have been true if the two young guys' budget had been a hundred times bigger. I fear the movie is a fluke, and while it may entice studios to support independent producers, it will not herald a new era in what pictures we see. The system does not change that fast. In other words, don't expect to see a surge in original movies.I personally was enthralled by The Blair Witch Project, but I warn you that a tiny budget can buy only so much. There are no sets, no special effects, no actors you ever saw before, and virtually no music. It is as lean as a movie can get. Artisan did spend quite a bit of money to clean up the film negative and to create stereo sound, but 16 mm film stock will always be cheap and grainy when compared to standard 35 mm film. In addition, the majority of the movie was shot with handheld cameras. Many scenes lurch and careen around and are apt to make some viewers get motion sickness.The idea of the movie is quite clever. Three students disappear in the Maryland woods while making a documentary about a local legend called the Blair witch. A year later, the film they shot is found. This is pieced together into a sort of documentary that acts as a photographic record of what happened. The directors even gave the characters the real names of the actors who played them. The result is a pseudo-documentary which is perhaps made all the more frightening by what it does not show. It is the first hit movie in ages that leaves so much to a viewer's imagination. You are left with more questions than answers. Some people will be totally frustrated by this, while others will be exhilarated.The three students are played by Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard. This is the first movie any of them have appeared in, and we are lucky that all of them prove to be talented actors. Donahue is especially effective as the group's leader. The way she seems to age, as she goes from happy young girl to terrified woman, is remarkable. Her transition from authority figure to someone on the brink of madness is terrifying.Because it doesn't have the razzle-dazzle you are so used to in your movies, you are apt to decide that The Blair Witch Project isn't scary at all. Maybe you'll even decide it's dumb. Maybe you'll laugh at its amatuerish appearance. And maybe you'll find yourself constantly glancing over your shoulder the next time you take a walk in the woods, because, just maybe, those woods are never going to end and you'll be lost in them forever.

469622,AZZ4GD20C58ND,6305568901,M. Brookes,"[1, 1]","I remember watching this when it first came out and not being greatly impressed. It wasn't a bad film by any means, but it didn't match up to the hype surrounding it's release. I thought I'd give it another watch and I'll confess that I enjoyed it more this time round.That's not say that it's a great film, far from it, but it is a solid horror movie that makes good use of very little. It's biggest strength for me is that it relies more on atmosphere and building the feeling of tension rather than shocks or cheap camera tricks.The lost footage format has been used many times since, but what The Blair Witch Project gets right compared to most of these later films is that it feels authentic, most films of a similar vein had obviously higher production values that fight with the raw footage concept.The film's story is a simple one, local legend tells of a witch that haunts the forest. A team of young film makers head into the woods to film a documentary about the legend. The story progresses at a slow pace, it teases at the presence in the woods and most of the film is simply the crews' reactions to these clues. It does however build pace to an abrupt and slightly enigmatic ending.Much has been made of the film's very low budget and while it shows it doesn't really harm the film.

Fields,"[6, 12]","To all of those folks out there that walked out of the theater wanting their money back because they didn't see a witch or blood or people being torn limb from limb, WAKE UP!  In order for this movie to terrify you, you have to have an alert and productive mind.  Remember Psycho?  Did you actually see the lady in shower get stabbed?  Did you see buckets of blood?  Of course not but it scared you just the same.The Blair Witch Project used the same tactics.  Three people wander off to get film on a legend that they've heard.  The town of Burketsville had an unusually high death rate of young children for a time.  After interviwing some of the locals, the film crew decides to venture into the woods to find the shack that the so-called Blair Witch was using.  The crew gets lost and has to spend the night in the woods where something appears to be following them.  Trying to descibe this film any further than that just wouldn't be helpful to you at this time.  It is a story that reveals itself in the visual, not just auditorially.What could be scarier than being lost in the woods at night?  The scariest things you can imagine are in your own mind.  That's why kids are afraid of the dark.  Their minds are young, fertile and active.  They don't even know what they're afraid of, they just are.  This film uses that same principle.Our minds have become lazy from having everthing being presented to it on a silver platter.  No time to think, just keep feeding it images so it doesn't have to do any work on it's own!I don't think I've ever seen a more frightening movie and I've seen them all.  I love horror and I'm always fascinated by the many different ways that Hollywood comes up with to scare us.

I don't blame people for warming up to something different than the standard slasher [junk]..., but ""Blair Witch"" rips off almost verbatim two similiar films, one from the 1970s called Cannibal Holocaust (see earlier review), and another which came out about a year before ""BW"" which was set in New Jersey (around the famous ""Jersey Devil"" legend) and has an almost identical plotline. You can rent this film, whose name escapes me, at Hollywood Video... It HAS been done before. That's number one. Number two is that gimmickery aside (and most of the appeal of this film was that so many people were duped, for a short while, into believing it might have been real), this isn't a very scary movie. It's somewhat disturbing, particularly if you have ever been lost in the woods and started to wonder if you'd ever get out, but I can't recall being scared. Probably because I wished Heather would either shut ... up or get killed off by the Blair Witch.

The flick has its moments, and I must give major props to how it was packaged and marketed, but packaging and marketing gimmicks don't make a good movie.

It tells the story of three student film-makers who hike deep into the Maryland woods to shoot a documentary about the legendary Blair witch who is known by the townspeople to have killed several children in the area for two centuries. The three young students are never seen again, but their terrifying footage is found a year later and we, the audience, get to see the mysterious, harrowing last days of their known lives.At first the doomed project is more like a whimsical outing. Heather (Heather Donahue) is the bossy director; Mike (Michael Williams) is the wisecracking soundman; and Josh (Joshua Leonard) is the laid back cinematographer. The three actually seem to be having fun until they get lost...and find ominous ritualistic symbols hanging in the trees...and see and hear strange, frightening things in the night...To say anymore than that would spoil a movie that must actually be seen to be believed. It is captivating, tense, and brilliantly scary.The performances are very credible especially Donahue who was unjustly voted Worst Actress at the Annual Raspberry Awards. She has a knockout anti-climatic speech towards the end of the film that provides her character with some much-needed vulnerability under her strong-willed stubbornness.The film was a monstrous financial success especially considering the $10,000 budget. It created a huge Blair witch hype over the Internet and spawned a sequel in 2000. The writers/directors (Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez) obviously understood that our imaginations are a terrifying thing. A lot of the time what is never seen can be the scariest thing in the world. One thing's for sure, camping will never be the same again.Rated R for very strong language and some very scary innuendos.

The entire film makes sense IF - and it's a big if - you watch  carefully and listen closely. I know most people don't like having to  concentrate on a film, but in this case it is vital. In fact, the entire  last ten minutes are explained by the first ten minutes - especially the  wonderful final moments; one of the most haunting images I've seen for a  long time.2. The camerawork is shaky for a number of reasons. Firstly,  neither Josh nor Heather have experience in using this equipment; at one  point, Josh explicitly states that he has used the camera once before.  Secondly, Heather's enthusiasm for recording gets the better of her and she  begins filming everything regardless of content or quality. Thirdly, the  equipment is heavy and they are tramping around rough ground. Fourthly, by  the middle of the film, much of the filming takes place while the  characters are in a state of panic.3. The swearing. Get over it - these  are characters who adopt a certain type of speech, which is, in my  experience of teaching teenagers, totally realistic.4. This is not a  true story, and frankly, anyone who is gullible enough to think it is  deserves a very rude wake-up call indeed. It is a very clever pastiche of a  certain style of film making, but it has precedents - notably Woody Allen's  &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot;, which was similarly criticised for its  shaky camerawork and excessive profanity.5. No, it is not the scariest  film ever made - that is called hype and is best ignored. Anyone  approaching _any_ film expecting it to be the scariest thing ever made is  setting themselves up for a disappointment.

Ever since this cheap, low budget film was released, it inspired producers everywhere that cheap/low budget/and bad ideas can be make a quick buck.When I first heard about this movie, there was a humongous rave about it, I wasnt intrested in the movie, but got dragged along anyway.... while watching the movie I was not the slightest bit scared, everything was bad, and nothing was sacry. Then when the movie finished, i think everyone had the same thought going through there head as me ""Is that it? Is that the end? huh?""The movie got more hype then it deserved too! First they said it was a true story, and it was actors reinacting the tapes found. Then they admitted it wasnt 100% accuret, there where a few scenes added to the movie to make it scaryier, like the tent shaking...then they admited that the whole thing was 100% fictional!!!!! so they had to lie to get this garbage veiwed!!!I have only heard people say that the thing that scares them about the movie is it now makes them afraid to walk in the woods alone.. and claim that the movie was brilliant for achieving that idea.... i guess they never saw Friday the 13th???I know alot of you love this movie.

But I found this film particularly disappointing.  Usually I don't like scary or horror films (life is scary enough, don't you think?) but I made an exception here, since it sounded like something special.Unfortunately, the film turned out to be exactly what it was, a low budget amateur film made by students.  The film quality was poor (OK, so it was meant to be, but did it have to be that bad?), the sound quality was terrible (they could have improved this and not seriously compromised the &quot;film verit&eacute;&quot; aspect, surely?), and the choice of shots was a bit repetitive (again, I suppose they were meant to be lost, going over the same ground again and again, but why so many extended shots of leaves?).  As for the end, surely we could have been given a bit more to go on?I certainly applaud the film-makers for making such a popular film on a very low budget, but I'm afraid it didn't do a lot for me.  Personally I didn't feel any atmosphere in the film, I didn't feel any mounting despair or desperation, and I never managed to really empathise with the characters as they got more and more lost.  That said, I was quite impressed with the scene in the woods when they come across all the figures made of sticks, but that was the best bit in the whole film.I think what is really essential in liking this film is to be able to suspend your disbelief and really believe that it is a genuine film of a bunch of students who got lost (apparently some people really did think it was genuine, but I reckon the credits at the end probably gave it away!).  For some reason I just wasn't able to do that with this film.Overall, top marks to the makers for making a ton of money, but for the shaky shots, rustling leaves, bad sound, etc., nil points.",1,"Sadly disappointing, didn't live up to the hype.",970790400,"10 6, 2000",2000,2010,"['Usually', 'people', 'just', 'review', 'what', 'really', 'enjoy', 'confession', 'reckon', 'doing', 'review', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'probably', 'good', 'soul.The', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'film', 'was', 'absolutely', 'immense', 'nothing', 'could', 'live', 'up', 'found', 'film', 'particularly', 'disappointing', 'Usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'scary', 'horror', 'films', 'life', 'scary', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'made', 'exception', 'here', 'sounded', 'something', 'special.Unfortunately', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'amateur', 'film', 'made', 'students', 'film', 'quality', 'was', 'poor', 'OK', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'did', 'have', 'be', 'bad', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'terrible', 'could', 'have', 'improved', 'not', 'seriously', 'compromised', 'quot', 'film', 'verit', 'eacute', 'quot', 'aspect', 'surely', 'choice', 'shots', 'was', 'bit', 'repetitive', 'again', 'suppose', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'lost', 'going', 'same', 'ground', 'again', 'again', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'extended', 'shots', 'leaves', 'end', 'surely', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'bit', 'more', 'go', 'certainly', 'applaud', 'film-makers', 'making', 'such', 'popular', 'film', 'very', 'low', 'budget', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'lot', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'mounting', 'despair', 'desperation', 'never', 'managed', 'really', 'empathise', 'characters', 'got', 'more', 'more', 'lost', 'said', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'scene', 'woods', 'when', 'come', 'figures', 'made', 'sticks', 'was', 'best', 'bit', 'whole', 'film.I', 'think', 'what', 'really', 'essential', 'liking', 'film', 'be', 'able', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'really', 'believe', 'genuine', 'film', 'bunch', 'students', 'who', 'got', 'lost', 'apparently', 'people', 'really', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'genuine', 'reckon', 'credits', 'end', 'probably', 'gave', 'away', 'reason', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'do', 'film.Overall', 'top', 'marks', 'makers', 'making', 'ton', 'money', 'shaky', 'shots', 'rustling', 'leaves', 'bad', 'sound', 'etc.', 'nil', 'points']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

469639,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,6305568901,Mike,"[3, 4]","""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999)I still really don't know what to think about this film. I've watched it about 3 times, and I liked it all the times I viewed it, but somehow this film continuously leaves me muddled. I don't know whether to think this movie is a bunch of baloney about people running around with cameras scaring each other or whether it's a true scare-fest with excellent ideas and a great premise. I think I'd go with the second one, but there were elements of the first one that put the movie down a little for me grade-wise.The premise and whole filming idea for The Blair Witch Project was excellent. It added more to the atmosphere and it proved that what we can't see is much scarier. You don't get much blood, guts and gore, but what you do get is a really creepy setting, tonnes of scary rocks and some fantastic acting to make the scenarios real.On the subject of acting, I am very shocked that Heather Donahue got a Razzie for this film. I thought she was really great in the movie. Donahue is the leader of the cast and takes the material seriously, and she is her character - she's very frightened and believable in her role. Michael and Joshua are also very good, but Donahue is the movie's heart and soul, and she is exceptionally right into her character. I mean, she doesn't deserve an Oscar or anything, but a Razzie? No way!I also liked the idea of the movie how they used the actors real names. Somehow it made it a little more believable and I think the actors got into the characters a little bit more because they could base it on themselves. This film does have a lot of great idea and premises, such as one I've just mentioned, but some scenes are unnecessary and you might get a little tired of the constant swearing and screaming and joking, instead of getting in touch with the more scary side of the film.None-the-less, I still enjoyed the movie. I don't think many people realise how sometimes this movie brings across some warmth and quite a bit of character development, like in one scene the group talk about what they like to do on a Sunday morning (""go for a walk in the woods,"" says Donahue, following it up with ""not anymore!"") and what they'd love to eat at the current time of their loss in the woods. The movie also has a reasonably funny map scene.But, in the end, The Blair Witch Project is all about terror and scaring the audience, and they succeed in this. Just so you know, this is not another slasher teen movie like I Know What You Did Last Summer or Scream. This is raw, real, terror and you'll be clutching your pillow with fright. The final scene in particular is one of the most frightening sequences I've ever seen on film. All in all, this is a very original piece that will be remembered for a long time after viewing, and I recommend it to those who like something new in horror films.MY GRADE: B+",4,Original concept and very eerie,1018224000,"04 8, 2002",2002,2868,"['Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', '1999', 'still', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'film', ""'ve"", 'watched', '3', 'times', 'liked', 'times', 'viewed', 'somehow', 'film', 'continuously', 'muddled', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'think', 'movie', 'bunch', 'baloney', 'people', 'running', 'around', 'cameras', 'scaring', 'other', 'true', 'scare-fest', 'excellent', 'ideas', 'great', 'premise', 'think', ""'d"", 'go', 'second', 'one', 'were', 'elements', 'first', 'one', 'put', 'movie', 'down', 'little', 'grade-wise.The', 'premise', 'whole', 'filming', 'idea', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'was', 'excellent', 'added', 'more', 'atmosphere', 'proved', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'scarier', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'blood', 'guts', 'gore', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'really', 'creepy', 'setting', 'tonnes', 'scary', 'rocks', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'make', 'scenarios', 'real.On', 'subject', 'acting', 'am', 'very', 'shocked', 'Heather', 'Donahue', 'got', 'Razzie', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'Donahue', 'leader', 'cast', 'material', 'seriously', 'character', 'very', 'frightened', 'believable', 'role', 'Michael', 'Joshua', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Donahue', 'movie', 'heart', 'soul', 'exceptionally', 'right', 'character', 'mean', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'Oscar', 'anything', 'Razzie', 'way', 'also', 'liked', 'idea', 'movie', 'how', 'used', 'actors', 'real', 'names', 'Somehow', 'made', 'little', 'more', 'believable', 'think', 'actors', 'got', 'characters', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'could', 'base', 'film', 'have', 'lot', 'great', 'idea', 'premises', 'such', 'one', ""'ve"", 'just', 'mentioned', 'scenes', 'are', 'unnecessary', 'might', 'get', 'little', 'tired', 'constant', 'swearing', 'screaming', 'joking', 'instead', 'getting', 'touch', 'more', 'scary', 'side', 'film.None-the-less', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'people', 'realise', 'how', 'sometimes', 'movie', 'warmth', 'quite', 'bit', 'character', 'development', 'one', 'scene', 'group', 'talk', 'what', 'like', 'do', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'go', 'walk', 'woods', 'Donahue', 'following', 'up', 'not', 'anymore', 'what', ""'d"", 'love', 'eat', 'current', 'time', 'loss', 'woods', 'movie', 'also', 'reasonably', 'funny', 'map', 'scene.But', 'end', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'terror', 'scaring', 'audience', 'succeed', 'Just', 'know', 'not', 'slasher', 'teen', 'movie', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summer', 'Scream', 'raw', 'real', 'terror', ""'ll"", 'be', 'clutching', 'pillow', 'fright', 'final', 'scene', 'particular', 'one', 'most', 'frightening', 'sequences', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'very', 'original', 'piece', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'long', 'time', 'viewing', 'recommend', 'who', 'like', 'something', 'new', 'horror', 'films.MY', 'GRADE', 'B+']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

Ebert notes it has considerable entertainment value but lists it's importance in technical terms for being influential.Being the first indie blockbuster, made for 24k and shot with inexpensive hand held cameras and grosses more than $150 million.He says ""the message was inescapable in the next century, technology will place the capacity for feature filmaking into the hands of anyone who is sufficiently motivated, and audiences will not demand traditional ""production values"" before parting with their money"".Now the entertainment value, i remember an internet buzz about this movie and rumors that it was real.  I saw it in Boston when it first came out when the potential this stuff really happend was talked about.  For me personally what you don't see can be scarier then what you do see, most people will imagine things far worse than they are and the fear of the unknown is one of the deepest fears.  I don't need a big digitized ghost to scare me, a noise in the woods, the dark, a baby crying, something chasing you, you shutting a window and turning around and it's open, things like that are freaky subtle things.I don't know about other kids growing up but me and my friends would always go to freaky places like the three kids in The Blair Witch Project do, so right there i can see me and my friends hearing about some local myth and going to check it out for fun.  The documentary style looks real and feels real again i can relate.  A movie like Alien is great i actually love that movie but to be terrified and put myself in there situation I'd have to be an astronaut on a spaceship in the future and while doing that I'd be watching Alien with the crew, then yea before i went to bed Id be on edge.Also the acting i don't know how it can be criticized it's almost like they weren't even acting and they were feeling whatever emotions they were feeling in the film for real.Like i said people love this or hate it, with 1800 reviews half being 5's the other half being 1's.  I love horror and I've seen all kinds from the silent film era till today and I would put Blair Witch in my top 2 of scariest movies, but that's me.Share your thoughts below.**Also ranked number 30 on the Bravo Channels 100 Scariest movie moments list**",5,Hate it or love the underdog's on top.

469645,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,6305568901,mitchell5954,"[0, 0]","The Blair Witch Project is the first found-footage film to get a considerable amount of hype behind it, and is also the film that kick-started the found-footage genre we have today.  Did the film live up to all the hype behind it?  To many people it didn't live up to it.  This film is one of the more polarizing films I've ever seen.  In my opinion, the film did not live up to the hype, but I still thought it was a decent film.  I thought it was great that they could do so much with a little budget and no special effects.  I liked the characters save one and I felt their plight.The story is as follows.  Three college students, Heather, Michael, and Josh, are making a documentary on the Blair Witch Legend.  They interview a few people who know the legend and some even claim to have seen the witch.  Then they go into the woods to look for more evidence but end up getting lost.  They soon learn that there is someone following them.  Is it the Blair Witch or is it just a crazy person?  Whoever it is it starts hunting them down one at a time.This film does do a lot right.  It has a very interesting legend behind it.  The start of the film is the main characters interviewing people about the Blair Witch phenomenon, and the legend surrounding her is quite interesting.  The film also has great atmosphere.  There is a sense of mystery with throughout the film.  Are the stories really real?  Who is hunting the main characters in the woods?  Was it the Blair Witch or just a crazy person?  I like that they did not actually show who is behind this.  Whether they had shown a crazy person or a witch it would have been disappointing and would have ruined the sense of mystery.The lack of special effects really adds to the realism the film is going for.  Too many found-footage films use CGI or some sort of effects and it really does not work.  Found-footage films are meant to give a sense of realism and give the idea that this really happened.  In my opinion this film is the only one to really pull that notion off.I did like most of the characters.  To be more exact I like two out of the three characters that are in the film.  Michael and Josh I thought were liable and funny, and I felt for them when things went wrong.  The girl, Heather, I do not like at all.  She was too pushy, she complains a lot, and she treats Mick and Josh like crap a lot.  Everything always has to go her way or she freaks out.  She brought the movie down quite a bit for me.Overall, I thought The Blair Witch Project is a decent experiment.  It was not an amazing film as it was hyped up to be but I think it is still good.  Whether you love it or hate it the film did have a huge impact on the movie industry.  It did kick-start the found-footage genre for better or worse.  I would say it is definitely worth at least one viewing.",3,"Not Great, but Definately not Horrible as Many People Say!",1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,2830,"['Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'first', 'found-footage', 'film', 'get', 'considerable', 'amount', 'hype', 'also', 'film', 'kick-started', 'found-footage', 'genre', 'have', 'today', 'Did', 'film', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'many', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'polarizing', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'opinion', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'still', 'thought', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'could', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'little', 'budget', 'special', 'effects', 'liked', 'characters', 'save', 'one', 'felt', 'plight.The', 'story', 'Three', 'college', 'students', 'Heather', 'Michael', 'Josh', 'are', 'making', 'documentary', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Legend', 'interview', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'legend', 'even', 'claim', 'have', 'seen', 'witch', 'Then', 'go', 'woods', 'look', 'more', 'evidence', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'lost', 'soon', 'learn', 'someone', 'following', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'just', 'crazy', 'person', 'Whoever', 'hunting', 'down', 'one', 'time.This', 'film', 'do', 'lot', 'right', 'very', 'interesting', 'legend', 'start', 'film', 'main', 'characters', 'interviewing', 'people', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'phenomenon', 'legend', 'surrounding', 'quite', 'interesting', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'sense', 'mystery', 'film', 'Are', 'stories', 'really', 'real', 'Who', 'hunting', 'main', 'characters', 'woods', 'Was', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'just', 'crazy', 'person', 'like', 'did', 'not', 'actually', 'show', 'who', 'had', 'shown', 'crazy', 'person', 'witch', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'disappointing', 'would', 'have', 'ruined', 'sense', 'mystery.The', 'lack', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'realism', 'film', 'going', 'Too', 'many', 'found-footage', 'films', 'use', 'CGI', 'sort', 'effects', 'really', 'not', 'work', 'Found-footage', 'films', 'are', 'meant', 'give', 'sense', 'realism', 'give', 'idea', 'really', 'happened', 'opinion', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'pull', 'notion', 'off.I', 'did', 'most', 'characters', 'be', 'more', 'exact', 'like', 'two', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'film', 'Michael', 'Josh', 'thought', 'were', 'liable', 'funny', 'felt', 'when', 'things', 'went', 'wrong', 'girl', 'Heather', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'was', 'too', 'pushy', 'lot', 'Mick', 'Josh', 'crap', 'lot', 'Everything', 'always', 'go', 'way', 'out', 'brought', 'movie', 'down', 'quite', 'bit', 'me.Overall', 'thought', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'decent', 'experiment', 'was', 'not', 'amazing', 'film', 'was', 'hyped', 'up', 'be', 'think', 'still', 'good', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'huge', 'impact', 'movie', 'industry', 'did', 'kick-start', 'found-footage', 'genre', 'better', 'worse', 'would', 'say', 'definitely', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'viewing']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

Jarrett ""SoundgardenFanForLife""","[3, 4]","When THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT hit the internet blitz back when it was first commandeered, the hype was huge...everybody wanted to see it before it even hit the theaters. The fact that it only cost about $40k to make and made over $200 million worldwide is a testament to the power of this film. The cheap budget and documentary style camera work actually made the film a lot scarier than it really would have been had it been filmed as a straight-ahead horror film. The scares are plenty in this...those scenes at night are frightening, and your imagination can only create the terror that they are experiencing. The three actors picked in the movie (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael C. Williams) are all very convincing in their roles. This was just so dark, so threatening a movie. At the end of the movie, when they find the ""witch's"" house, the terror piles on until the last shot when Heather's camera hits the ground and she is implied to have been ""knocked out"" by something, and the fact you never see it is very terrifying. You won't sleep for months after watching this, but some of you won't have any trouble if horror is your slice of bread.BLAIR WITCH PROJECT did what no other horror movie did...there were no zombies; there were no ghosts; there were no serial killers; the horror in this movie is all implied. It makes it very scary, downright threatening, and very suspenseful. It's no wonder the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT became a huge hit.

469648,A1E15WYG9C47X1,6305568901,"""mobby_uk""","[0, 0]","Have a 35,000 budget, make a film using three talented amateurs, hire no sets and just film mainly in the woods, market your film agressively on the internet, and get a 240 million return..It is not so bad now is it?This is the story of the Blair Witch Project, a film that has divided movie goers like no other film has managed to do in the last few years. Opinions about a film have never been so extreme, either people hated it, felt dizzy due to the constant moving camera and grainy pictures, and did not see what the fuss was all about, or many have seen it as a masterpiece, a film full of tension, original and fresh ideas, and a cinematic experience that does not happen too often these days.I am of the latter group.I saw BWP, to be honest because of the hype surrounding it, but having said that, I really did not have prejudgements, only a 'let us watch and see' attitude. I have to admit that what I saw was a chilling and disturbing horror film.As a result I was quite disappointed with the very low marks and negative feedback that came from many,clearly missing the point and the atmosphere of the film completely.One criticism of this group is that they were never scared at all in this 'supposedly' horror film.Well what makes a horror film I wonder?The genre has evolved greately since the days of Boris Karloff and giant spiders, and while films like The Haunting and Night of Living Dead have started the psychological horror genre, buliding tension, unseen or/and determined evil, films like Halloween have revolutionized the genre, which resulted in many imitations to this day, where the tension and brilliant camera work and music helped to grab the viewer's attention and senses till the very last frame. The Omen and the Exorcist went a bit further and used the supernatural, biblical evil to tickle the imagination and fear of movie goers everywhere.Of course, the genre took another path as well, the path of gore.And the seventies were awash with blood and spalsh movies, like Argento's films, relying on the viewer's eyes, shock images and repulsion to induce the required reaction.Each sub genre had its champions, and while in the eighties and most of the nineties, horror films experienced a creative crisis, in comes filmmakers with fresh ideas to revive it, most recently we saw The Others, and The Ring/Ringu and of course The Blair Witch Project.The BWP uses cleverly the supernatural, unseen evil, and relies on building up the tension gradually until the climatic ending, the Donohue's 'I am too scared to open my eyes, too scared to close them' speech, which in my opinion is one of the most chilling scenes ever filmed.Another criticism of the BWP is that it looks like a film student excercise. Well in a way it is, for all involved are amateurs working on a flimsy budget, but if it is so, then I it is a brilliant student excercise!What I found very clever, is the set, the woods, take a life of their own. Like the hotel in Shining, it comes alive, breathes heavily down the character's necks, and carries with it many secrets,both innocent and sinister.This film does not really mean to make you jump in your seat like some well used horror stunt, and does not aim at your visual, more basic, stimulis.It is rather a gripping anxiety and tension filled ride aimed at your brain.In BWP, the characters are trapped from the beginning, and you can feel that they are doomed from the start.What you watch throughout the film is how and when and not if they will all persih.There is no gore in the film. If you are a fan of this subgenre then, of course you will be disappointed.If you like intelligent films then you should watch BWP with fresh unjudgemental eyes.If you are not scared by what you see, then probably horror  movies are not for you.Yet if you like these type of films, the BWP is certainly one of the best, if anything only because at last we have independant filmmakers with vision and a love of their craft, something which is so desperately needed in any genre.",5,Not Only a Hype!,941414400,"11 1, 1999",1999,4023,"['Have', '35,000', 'budget', 'make', 'film', 'using', 'three', 'talented', 'amateurs', 'hire', 'sets', 'just', 'film', 'mainly', 'woods', 'market', 'film', 'agressively', 'internet', 'get', '240', 'million', 'return..It', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'now', 'story', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'film', 'divided', 'movie', 'goers', 'other', 'film', 'managed', 'do', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Opinions', 'film', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'extreme', 'either', 'people', 'hated', 'felt', 'dizzy', 'due', 'constant', 'moving', 'camera', 'grainy', 'pictures', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'many', 'have', 'seen', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'full', 'tension', 'original', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'not', 'happen', 'too', 'often', 'days.I', 'am', 'latter', 'group.I', 'saw', 'BWP', 'be', 'honest', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'having', 'said', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'prejudgements', 'only', ""'let"", 'watch', 'see', 'attitude', 'have', 'admit', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'chilling', 'disturbing', 'horror', 'result', 'was', 'quite', 'disappointed', 'very', 'low', 'marks', 'negative', 'feedback', 'came', 'many', 'clearly', 'missing', 'point', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'completely.One', 'criticism', 'group', 'were', 'never', 'scared', ""'supposedly"", 'horror', 'film.Well', 'horror', 'film', 'wonder', 'genre', 'evolved', 'greately', 'days', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'giant', 'spiders', 'films', 'Haunting', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'have', 'started', 'psychological', 'horror', 'genre', 'buliding', 'tension', 'unseen', 'or/and', 'determined', 'evil', 'films', 'Halloween', 'have', 'revolutionized', 'genre', 'resulted', 'many', 'imitations', 'day', 'where', 'tension', 'brilliant', 'camera', 'work', 'music', 'helped', 'grab', 'viewer', 'attention', 'senses', 'till', 'very', 'last', 'frame', 'Omen', 'Exorcist', 'went', 'bit', 'further', 'used', 'supernatural', 'biblical', 'evil', 'tickle', 'imagination', 'fear', 'movie', 'goers', 'everywhere.Of', 'course', 'genre', 'took', 'path', 'as', 'well', 'path', 'gore.And', 'seventies', 'were', 'awash', 'blood', 'spalsh', 'movies', 'Argento', 'films', 'relying', 'viewer', 'eyes', 'shock', 'images', 'repulsion', 'induce', 'required', 'reaction.Each', 'sub', 'genre', 'had', 'champions', 'eighties', 'most', 'nineties', 'horror', 'films', 'experienced', 'creative', 'crisis', 'filmmakers', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'revive', 'most', 'recently', 'saw', 'Others', 'Ring/Ringu', 'course', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project.The', 'BWP', 'cleverly', 'supernatural', 'unseen', 'evil', 'relies', 'building', 'up', 'tension', 'gradually', 'climatic', 'ending', 'Donohue', 'am', 'too', 'scared', 'open', 'eyes', 'too', 'scared', 'close', 'speech', 'opinion', 'one', 'most', 'chilling', 'scenes', 'ever', 'filmed.Another', 'criticism', 'BWP', 'film', 'student', 'excercise', 'Well', 'way', 'involved', 'are', 'amateurs', 'working', 'flimsy', 'budget', 'so', 'then', 'brilliant', 'student', 'excercise', 'What', 'found', 'very', 'clever', 'set', 'woods', 'take', 'life', 'own', 'hotel', 'Shining', 'alive', 'heavily', 'down', 'character', 'necks', 'many', 'secrets', 'innocent', 'sinister.This', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'mean', 'make', 'jump', 'seat', 'well', 'used', 'horror', 'stunt', 'not', 'aim', 'visual', 'more', 'basic', 'rather', 'gripping', 'anxiety', 'tension', 'filled', 'ride', 'aimed', 'brain.In', 'BWP', 'characters', 'are', 'trapped', 'beginning', 'can', 'feel', 'are', 'doomed', 'start.What', 'watch', 'film', 'how', 'when', 'not', 'will', 'persih.There', 'gore', 'film', 'are', 'fan', 'subgenre', 'then', 'course', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed.If', 'like', 'intelligent', 'films', 'then', 'should', 'watch', 'BWP', 'fresh', 'unjudgemental', 'eyes.If', 'are', 'not', 'scared', 'what', 'see', 'then', 'probably', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'you.Yet', 'type', 'films', 'BWP', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'anything', 'only', 'last', 'have', 'independant', 'filmmakers', 'vision', 'love', 'craft', 'something', 'so', 'desperately', 'needed', 'genre']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

Even the ending which has some mild eeriness is really nothing and it's only about a minute long.

Apart from the fact that the principle actors and actresses shot the film it is not all that unique. In fact it turns out that BWP was made shortly after the directors watched a film called ""The Last Broadcast"", but they claimed their inspiration came from ""Cannibal Holocaust"". Truth be told, they pilfered the lot from ""The Last Broadcast"" that was made only the year before.So we turn on the news and we hear that 3 actors/actresses are dead and that their film cans have been discovered and a movie called ""The Blair Witch"" will be screening at cinemas shortly and we will all get to hear and see what happened to these people. IMDB even listed the actors/actresses as dead. So the world goes and watches the film and some people get scared and this gets it even more hype.When you put it into the context that non-mainstream movie goers, and mainstream movie goers, who do not watch horror, went to see this film then you can understand why it made them scared. Let's face it - most of these people who where scared could barely name five other horror films that they had seen in the last decade. We also had people walking out of the cinema saying - ""WTF?? Did I just watch?"" and ""Damn that was soooo disappointing."" As a whole, BWP works wonders. BWP is the only horror film that some people have ever sat through, because it was hip to do so. When the hype died down that was the last horror film they would likely ever see. Horror fans rate this one somewhere between ""appalling"" and ""okay"". Very few fans of this genre think that it is a film worthy of 5 or 4 stars or even 3 at matter. I know there are plenty of fans of this genre who would even do the 2 and 1 or spit on it until their throat goes dry.I happen to think that this is great film to show to people who do not regularly watch horror, however if you are in any way familiar with this genre then it is hard to tell what you will think of it.

Unfortunately, this movie does not do that. It's a bummer because the film has a good concept, and they really didn't spend a  lot of money to make this movie, which generally translates to a simple,  straight-to-the-point story. &quot;Halloween&quot; was a low budget film by  John Carpenter, and that created an entire new genre of horror film-the  slasher flick. &quot;Blair Witch&quot;, though, is derivative of several  horror films; and, unfortunately, like a bad robber, it takes all the bad  stuff.Sometimes a movie, especially horror films can be both bad and  good. It can parody some of the bad stuff, and have a good story.  &quot;Scream&quot; did that effectively, not too long ago, and there are  several other examples that mix humor and fright. But &quot;Blair  Witch&quot;, due to its faux-documentary concept, boxes itself in and has  to take itself seriously, and eliminate any campy moments. So, instead the  director allows you to laugh along with the main characters in the  beginning of the movie, in an attempt to get you to acquaint yourself and  possibly relate to these three student filmmakers: director Heather  Donohue, cameraman Joshua Leonard, and soundman Mike Williams.The  characters' names are also the same as the actors, which adds to the  reality factor (or is an indication that these people might screw up and  call each other by their real names). In searching for information on the  legendary Blair Witch, a creature that supposedly kills children in the  nearby Maryland woods, they get themselves lost, and then become desperate  for survival. However, this film fails to reach a connection with its more  critical audience because these characters are very anti-heroic. In many  horror films, you find yourself screaming to the screen, &quot;Don't go  down there!&quot; or &quot;Watch out, behind you!&quot; In this movie, you  find yourself asking, &quot;How is that possible that you are so  dumb?&quot; or worse, &quot;When is someone going to die?&quot; This is  partly due to the fact that the characters are a little annoying, so you  have no sympathy. And second, they really are THAT stupid. (How can you  manage to navigate yourself in a complete circle hiking all day, if you  plan to just go south?  Can't you just use the sun?) If this film had more  intelligent characters, this movie could have worked; of course, then, they  wouldn't have gotten lost in the woods in the first place.Although I  was on the edge of my seat waiting for something to happen, &quot;it&quot;  never really happened, and what I was left with was disappointment, and  nausea, not from being disturbed or scared, but rather from the annoying  camerawork to give it the faux-documentary look.  On the upswing, the  acting is fine work, and there are some images which are very creepy--ones  that might spawn nightmares. But, it's not enough to make this film work.  Josh Bob says: if you must see it, wait for video, with some Dramamine  beside you. One and half stars.

People who saw this movie after the hype had started and were expecting the SCARIEST FILM OF ALL TIME!2. People who think that a film has to have graphic decapitations and disembowelments to be &quot;scary&quot;3. People who pride themselves on disdaining anything that proves to be too popular.The Blair Witch Project is one of the most effective and original films to come out of the independent movement in a long time.  Its fake-documentary format allows the filmmakers to play with the conventions of the horror genre.  It eschews standard shock moments for slowly building an atmosphere of apprehension.  The three actors do a mostly marvellous job of showing their characters coming apart at the seams.  Also, as a former film student, I found their characters immediately recognizable.  Heather's self-important stand-ups at the cemetary and Coffin Rock are dead-on perfect.I've never understood the complaints about the jerky handheld camera work.  These were supposedly student filmmakers hiking in the woods.  What were they supposed to do, bring a steady-cam rig?I loved the ending because it had the guts not to spoonfeed the answers to the audience.  We're told in the &quot;Curse of the Blair Witch&quot; fake-documentary that the footage found was &quot;inconclusive&quot; so naturally the movie can't be clear about the fate of the students.Are there flaws?  Sure, but none are fatal.  I think they knock about a half-star off the rating, which &quot;The Curse of the Blair Witch&quot; adds right back on the score.In many ways, the fake documentary that is included with the DVD is more effective than the movie.  This, more than anything, convinced many people that the Blair Witch Project was true.  If I hadn't known ahead of time that it was fake, I might have bought it too.  &quot;Curse&quot; would not look out of place being shown on the Discovery Channel.The old geezer &quot;historian&quot; is perfectly drawn and convincing as the &quot;colorful local&quot; who buys into the mythology hook, line and sinker.  Also effective is the 70s-era interview with a &quot;real&quot; witch.  It was this touch of including &quot;archival&quot; footage from another era that really gives &quot;Curse&quot; its sense of reality.  Had all the interviews been contemporary, the fakery might have been more apparent.I had some problems with the 40's era &quot;newsreels&quot;.  The interview with &quot;Rustin Parr&quot; was quite effective but the lead-in looked a little too staged.  Then again, newsreels sometimes had that staged feel to them, so this is not a huge problem.  It may have been deliberate.The DVD version also included a audio commentary track from the directors/writers.  This is very entertaining, as they do things like pointing that Josh really was late and then mocking their actors/camera operators for their shot choices.  (I've been on student film shoots and bad shot choices only contribute to the realism).So my advice is: ignore the naysayers and ignore the hype.

Perhaps to savour  these scary scenes, a strong imaginative mind is pretty much a mandatory  requirement here, and I do mean, to an extreme level so much as to  visualise a horrible-looking creature even though it might  not be there?!  Otherwise, the average viewer is likely to be left baffled and unsatisfied  when the scary scenes pass.The use of home video camera shooting was a  refreshing idea, but its novelty was no solid compensation  for the movie's  weak characterisation of the title subject. There were too little visual  vestiges provided in the film as regards to how the witch looked like. Even  a scary-looking shadow would have helped greatly. The &quot;witch&quot;  seemed able to evade the camera all the time.On the whole, the movie was  quite a bland and quiet experience both in the visual and audio aspects.  The only memorable parts of the movie  where things became creepy were  probably that of the explorers discovering twig figures and  the  concluding part.

Johnson,"[10, 15]","Start by putting me into that category of people who - knowing and loving low-budget horror - cannot fathom the big deal about this entirely artless, witless production. Much has been made of the fact that Blair Witch ""only cost $25000"". WHAT WAS THE MONEY SPENT ON??? Bug spray? Who knows what it takes to trigger the kind of collective hysteria that sometimes allows US movie critics to lower their guard as much as they did to end up championing this glorified home movie (and a bad one at that!). How ironic that critics who normally display such antipathy to the horror genre would end up singing the praises of this film - undoubtedly the worst movie in the horror genre's recent revival (yes - even worse than Jan de Bont's abysmal The Haunting!). Thank heavens critics outside the US saw this film for what it was - a spectacularly anti-climactic non-event. Low budgets are no new thing for horror filmmakers - the best works of the genre are products of innovative filmmakers working with less than stellar budgets. And it is in horror more than any other type of film that filmmakers have proven to be so adept at wringing style, suspense and good storytelling out of the lowest of budgets (cf. Texas Chainsaw Massacre; Night of the Living Dead; Assault on Precinct 13 etc.). In this case, even the least stylish, least original low budget works (e.g. Friday the 13th) look like masterpieces in comparison to the inept ""filmmaking"" on display in Blair Witch. At least in even the worst of the cheapo horrors, directors make SOME effort to provide a decent story, told as best possible. Good luck trying to find any such inclination in this hysterical mess. Better luck trying to find a single scare in this film. Blair Witch makes Dogma 95 filmmaking look like cutting edge special effects cinema. It's nice to believe all of us have the ability or lack of it to make multi-million dollar blockbusters - and Blair Witch proves that we all can. It's nice to think we can all be George Romero or John Carpenter - but Blair Witch proves that we can't. A sad, cynical triumph of hip marketing over entertainment and no-style over no-substance, Blair Witch is the ultimate assault on the necessary value of story, plot and script in moviemaking. Blair Witch benefits from a high curiosity factor, of course.

I do have to say that you will either love this movie or hate it. Or, like me you may have a love/hate relationship with it. But let's give credit where credit is due. The most amazing thing about this film is that the acting is excellent all the way through. In fact the film is so well acted that few even realize that these people are acting with the use of a script. And though there are many moments that are not scripted, the execution of it all is very convincing. I also have to say it took some real creative thinking to pull it off so well. It really does seem like the entire thing was filmed by three students in the woods making a documentary about the legend of the Blair witch. The main three characters as well as those they interview are all perfect in their performances. It was very well done, and a nifty idea that worked so perfectly. Some already are aware that the film makers borrowed the idea of hand held cameras documenting the event from the classic horror epic 'Cannibal Holocaust'. I think this movie delivers the scares in a big way, and the sense of fear, isolation and misdirection the characters experience is equally shared by the audience.

I can deal with the &quot;home  movie&quot; gimmick, the purposely low-budget look and the amateurish  improv acting -- after all, if this were really unedited video footage shot  by film students (as the story implies), then it probably would look just  like that.  What I found unforgivably stupid was the plot.Much of the  horror (or lack thereof) was based on being lost in the woods and then  getting panicked by every little noise that went bump in the night.  That  might be scarey to city slickers who don't know anything about campcraft,  but I live in the Great North Woods and I'm not afraid of the forest at  night, so the &quot;horror&quot; fell flat.  Sure, there was something out  there that finally got them in the end, but only after they made so many  dumb mistakes that I began to feel they deserved to die out of sheer  stupidity.First of all, it's well-known that if you wander aimlessly  in the woods, you will go in circles, because most people have some degree  of left or right footedness and will take slightly longer strides with one  leg than the other.  Walking in circles is a dangerous waste of energy.  So  what you do upon getting lost in the woods is to STAY PUT, conserve your  strength, and build a nice big smokey signal fire -- that will bring the  firefighters to you in a hurry.  What these three idiots did was throw away  the map (mistake #2, and a really lame plot device), then walk themselves  to exhaustion, crossing the same creek and fallen log over and over again.  And that was mistake #3 because, as any Boy or Girl Scout knows, if you  follow water downhill, you have a pretty good chance of eventually finding  some sign of civilization, because people tend to settle along creeks at  the bottom of mountains.  Of course, if they had followed the stream back  into town, the movie would have ended halfway through -- which, in my  opinion, would be no great loss.",2,"Scarey to city  slickers ( well, maybe)",968025600,"09 4, 2000",2000,2028,"['movie', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', 'not', 'same', 'reasons', 'lot', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'cited', 'can', 'deal', 'quot', 'home', 'movie', 'quot', 'gimmick', 'purposely', 'low-budget', 'look', 'amateurish', 'improv', 'acting', 'were', 'really', 'unedited', 'video', 'footage', 'shot', 'film', 'students', 'story', 'implies', 'then', 'probably', 'would', 'look', 'just', 'What', 'found', 'unforgivably', 'stupid', 'was', 'plot.Much', 'horror', 'lack', 'thereof', 'was', 'based', 'being', 'lost', 'woods', 'then', 'getting', 'panicked', 'little', 'noise', 'went', 'bump', 'night', 'might', 'be', 'scarey', 'city', 'slickers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'campcraft', 'live', 'Great', 'North', 'Woods', ""'m"", 'not', 'afraid', 'forest', 'night', 'quot', 'horror', 'quot', 'fell', 'flat', 'Sure', 'was', 'something', 'out', 'there', 'finally', 'got', 'end', 'only', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'dumb', 'mistakes', 'began', 'feel', 'deserved', 'die', 'sheer', 'stupidity.First', 'well-known', 'wander', 'aimlessly', 'woods', 'will', 'go', 'circles', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'degree', 'left', 'right', 'footedness', 'will', 'take', 'slightly', 'longer', 'strides', 'one', 'leg', 'other', 'Walking', 'circles', 'dangerous', 'waste', 'energy', 'what', 'do', 'getting', 'lost', 'woods', 'STAY', 'PUT', 'conserve', 'strength', 'build', 'nice', 'big', 'smokey', 'signal', 'fire', 'will', 'bring', 'firefighters', 'hurry', 'What', 'three', 'idiots', 'did', 'was', 'throw', 'away', 'map', 'mistake', '2', 'really', 'lame', 'plot', 'device', 'then', 'walk', 'exhaustion', 'crossing', 'same', 'creek', 'fallen', 'log', 'over', 'again', 'was', 'mistake', '3', 'because', 'Boy', 'Girl', 'Scout', 'follow', 'water', 'downhill', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'chance', 'eventually', 'finding', 'sign', 'civilization', 'people', 'tend', 'settle', 'along', 'creeks', 'bottom', 'mountains', 'course', 'had', 'followed', 'stream', 'back', 'town', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'halfway', 'opinion', 'would', 'be', 'no', 'great', 'loss']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

It never pretended at any point, pre- or post-release to be anything but about those three filmmakers lost in the woods and a witch.

I give it 5 stars based on it's original approach to horror filmmaking and it's &quot;seemingly&quot; accurate interpretation of what may have happened to the real student filmmakers lost in the woods.  In general, you must suspend disbelief (put it in your pocket or under the couch momentarily) to enjoy any movie.  Try to see what the filmmakers are showing you with the least amount of bias.  Think about it: film, photographs, CDs, DVDs, etc. are all facsimiles of something extinct or extant.  Some can ask legitimately,  ""What is real?""  This is quite evident by the ideas positioned by the Wachowski brothers (The Matrix), and their statement, ""There is no spoon.""  They broke filmmaking ground at the other extreme.  BIG BUDGET.  Consequently, both companies make us think.  I have to be intellectually stimulated to really enjoy something-you know, to analyze it.  Therefore, even those who hate this film are enriched by its clinical study in terror provocation.  The concept of clinical study is to isolate a variable into a fixed setting and test specific reaction.  This movie functions from this perspective.  We all participated in the marketing hype.  However, the hype was generated more from the public's and media's reactions than from the true stories of the Blair Witch or this low-budget theatrical account.

The three students are subjected to a nightmarish ordeal in the woods, yet the viewer can't see it. Therein lies the effectiveness of the film: the horror is suggested, not shown.

It is one of the most successful independent films of all time. This movie may disappoint the casual horror film fan who is used to blood &amp; gore in a typical horror film. Yet, one must view this film with an open mind. Some of the best horror films DO NOT have to rely on blood &amp; gory special effects to be scary.

People found this ridiculous and asked him ""What IS scary, then?"". His response- ""When you don't see anything. It's up to the imagination."" And he couldn't be more correct- that sentiment is what contributed to the scare factor of the slow budget indie thriller The Blair Witch Project. Since then, almost NO movies have followed that rule at all. Blair Witch doesn't rely on scenes that make you jump right out of your seat at all- it relies on the fear of being alone and the creepy suspense/tension.Of course, the only movie I can think of that followed this rule is the notoriousParanormal Activity, and either you loved that movie or hated it. Blair Witch is no different- people were either bored/nauseous from the camera work/laughing, or were on the edge of their seats. I fall in the latter camp, as I'd take creepy tension over gimmicky gore and blood/""BOO!!!!"" scenes. This movie has neither of those, and should you expect this content, you will be disappointed big time.The Blair Witch Project tells the story of Josh, Heather and Michael, the three students who had heard of the blair witch urban legend. They are filming a documentary and decide to interview a few people before going out into the woods to find out more about the Blair Witch. The Blair WItch was a notorious unknown force who is said to have lived in those woods. However, things are bad from the start- camera problems and getting lost in the middle of nowhere is a killer. Then, it gets worse- they soon find out it's not just them in the woods, the Blair Witch is there too...Like I said, a large part of this movie is your imagination. That's right, nothing spoonfed to you. If you want to be told everything, go see something else. Blair Witch does a mighty fine job at letting your mind decide what's scary. This movie is a masterpiece for that reason. As well as the acting is just plain real- it's all improvised, and these actors do a bloody good job at it. And that ending- *shudder*.Overall, if you can take a film that relies on TENSION and not gimmicks to be scary, you will enjoy this.

Nothing happens until the final three minutes, and by then, you care so little for the 'gang' that you long to see them dispatched in a gruesome fashion.  Little men made of twigs and blurry hankerchiefs with red stains on them pass as supposedly scary imagery, and the standard of acting could be considered illegal most everywhere in the world.Sadly, I can award a one-star minimum to this ridiculous piece of dribble (I would very much like to give it no stars at all, and set it on fire, just to make sure nobody will ever see it again), and I strongly urge anybody on the market for a scary movie to buy something else, ANYTHING else, before The Blair Witch Project.

Yes, it will rescue you from hormone hell, otherwise known as puberty, aka middle school kids. How can I be so sure this movie will do the dirty deed? Read my TOP TEN reasons (even if you are NOT a Mr. or Mrs. One-of-the-Thousand-Points-of-Light):1. The only thing scary about this film is the way the three project team members treat each other. Can you say obnoxious to the core? I knew you could.2. Roughly every third word is the f-word, enough to put make a South Park punk blush or a sailor jealous. If the expletives are deleted, you're left with gibberish, which might sound like a witch after all.3. Leaves. Lots of leaves. This film was shot in the Maryland woods in late autumn. Imagine yourself on a National Geographic special, only the film crew is drunk, very drunk. Half of this film is shot looking at the ground.4. Heather, the team leader, should have her mouth duck-taped. Unfortunately, the guys were too stupid to bring any.5. Generation X in all its g(l)ory. Uh, duh, how do I use a compass and how can I find my way out of the woods? They bring a survival book but apparently can't read it. Shows you what happens when a generation is raised indoors with electronics. This group couldn't find their way out of a cereal box.6. Suspense is a tad bit lacking. I did, however, catch my breath once--but only to see if I was still breathing. The plot moves more slowly than Senator Strom Thurmond speaks, or about the same as your pet turtle swimming in a jar of molasses. The last ten minutes are better but I think the film crew was just eager to get things wrapped up to get out of the rain.7. Camera angles. In addition to the leaves--lots of leaves--the tent shots are all from the vantage point of a beetle. Two guys and a girl sleeping together...hmmm...you think they could have been a little more imaginative than &quot;what's that?&quot; &quot;did you hear that?&quot;8. Bogeyman. Well, if the official reviewers can say it, I can say it, right? WE NEVER SEE IT/HIM?HER. Oh, I know, we should let our imagination run wild. But by the time you realize you won't see IT (which is actually the film producers running around like fools), you don't give a flip anymore. Your imagination is asleep.9. Low Budget. Yeah, I know big budget doesn't always work (e.g. Waterworld) but, heh, $40,000. I mean, they had to give credit to a juice company for pete's sake. The producers should be required to reinvest this money in...yes, the Girl and Boy Scouts of America! Now that would be fittingly ironic.10. Cost.

So, as you can  tell, I was a little bit negative going into my first viewing of this  wildly popular movie. The first thing that occurred to me about this movie  once the characters got into the woods was that ANYONE WITH A CAMCORDER  COULD HAVE MADE THE SAME PICTURE! Here's what I got out of it: three  college kids get lost deep in the woods while shooting a documentary on the  legend of the Blair Witch. Along the way, they lose their map, they hear  strange noises at night, they get nervous and short with each other and say  the 'f' word a LOT, way too much, in fact. I think the reason this movie  became so popular was due to the fact that we've all feared getting lost in  the woods and this movie is all about that with the added paranoia of the  fable of a centuries-old witch out in the woods somewhere. The Sci-Fi  Channel's special &quot;Curse of the Blair Witch&quot; probably played a  large part with a lot of viewers decision to go see this, as it set up the  legend as being a true story- which it was not. I think the producer's had  a great idea here, but I also think they could have done more with it. Two  things we know for sure: they made a fortune off of this flick and there  will be imitations forthcoming.

Cloverfield, Quarantine, and the film I just finished ""The Blair Witch Project"" are all very scary, suspenseful, on the edge of your seat, and overall beyond scary as hell movies. Of course I could say these three movies are better in certain ways then others but I would specifically like to talk about The Blair Witch Project. First off this movie just gives you the creeps and I mean the REAL creeps. The Blair Witch Project is shot like your watching a homemade video off of a crappy video camera which makes it twice as scary as it is. There's no soundtrack (music) to the film and it looks just completely homemade. Its hard to make a movie scary when the quality of the movie is bad but if you can produce something that's that scary like that I think it deserves a 5 star.You have Heather, Josh, and Mike who document people telling stories and myths of the Blair Witch. Then they literally drive off in the middle of the woods supposedly where they think the Blair Witch exists. Heather and Mike have two separate cameras to document. The group thinks that they will just tour around the woods for the weekend, maybe film a few things here and there and then head home by Sunday to be back at work by Monday. Well...the weekend ends up longer then just 2 days and things start unraveling pretty bad and I mean SCARY BAD.I was watching this by myself at 12:00 a.m. with a lighting storm, in the dark, and in my room. After this experience I think I don't want to watch this ever again by myself. I just might have to show my friends this movie since they never seen it.Overall, The Blair Witch Project is a SCARY AS HELL MOVIE with creeps and shills running up your arms and spine, especially when your watching it BY YOURSELF IN THE DARK. Watching this movie any time of the day and with friends doesn't really at all remove your reaction after the film grows dark. Lets just say I won't be leaving my room by myself for at least a couple of days.

I'd watched the Sci-Fi Channel special (which is much, much better than the film--and it was FREE), read all the glowing Internet chat-room reviews, and saw the effective TV ads. So, I plunked down my cash, had a seat, and prepared myself to get scared. And I prepared myself. And prepared myself. And then, the lights came on, and the movie was over.How did I feel at that moment? The word is EXPLOITED. I'd just been gypped out of $...not to mention gas and snacks. Plus, I wasted my time!THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT has a great premise, no doubt about it--but the movie itself is an inane, low-budget mess. It goes on forever and ever and just limps to a conclusion that makes absolutely NO sense whatsoever. Ok, what was wrong with it? Well, first, we're led to believe that three filmmakers have been ""lost"" while exploring the legend of the Blair Witch, a legendary folktale that just might have its basis in reality. The filmmakers disappear under mysterious circumstances, but all the footage they shot has been found...thus THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT! Ah, but what is this footage? Try two hours of the ""F"" word (hence the ""R"" rating), a totally annoying ""performance"" by Heather Donahue (I wanted to slap her so badly!), and non-stop filming. I mean, non-stop--even when they're arguing and having hissy fits with each other, they never seem to forget to film it.

469719,A3TOQAMJURAYFC,6305568901,Roland Dark,"[1, 2]","Student filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S&aacute;nchez have delivered a quaint, spooky little tale with a budget tantamount to the price of catering a single meal for the cast of a standard Hollywood film.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" follows the misadventures of a trio of film students (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael C. Williams), who armed with two video cameras, set out to make a documentary based on an eerie Burkittsville, Maryland folk legend.  Not far into an excursion through a secluded woods, their playful enthusiasm gives way to tension and terror, as they find themselves lost, someone - or some thing - stalking them every step of the way.Relying on a paper-thin plot barely sustained by realistic emotion and situations, ""The Blair Witch Project"" generates its effectiveness by exploiting what most big budget films consider taboo - raw, shaky camera work, unheard-of actors, believable premise, and zero usage of special effects.  The environment selected for the shoot, virgin of set decorators and flashy lighting techniques, captures the essence of an ominous forest perfectly - I kind of like it because it bears a startling resemblance to my favorite place to hike!  The acting, which demonstrates the mental breakdown of the characters, is quite convincing, especially Heather Donahue (recently seen in Steven Spielberg's Sci-Fi Channel miniseries ""Taken"").  While the incessant arguing of the three tends to become a trifle vexing, it actually imbues the film with a higher degree of realism.  If you were lost in a cold, damp forest for days, hungry and thirsty, being followed by a psychotic killer or other entity with the intent to harm, would you be leisurely skipping, beaming a robust smile?  Still does not explain why they never took a cellular telephone...""The Blair Witch Project"" is not really scary - spooky, but not scary.  Over hyped and hardly a ""Citizen Kane"", but still worth a peek for its unique approach.

469720,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,6305568901,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 8]","&quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; succeeds where so many horror films fail because of the sheer simplicity of its conception and design, allowing  it to tap far more deeply into a wide range of primal fears than the  conventional &quot;fright&quot; films churned out regularly by major  Hollywood studios. While the latter films tend to dilute their terror  through overplotting, over production and over reliance on special effects,  &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; eschews all that for creativity, visual  inventiveness and an admirable conviction that what is left unseen is often  more terrifying than what is visualized.The film presents itself  cleverly as a pseudodocumentary tale of a group of fictional college  students who become lost in the woods while endeavoring to film a study of  a local scary legend. With this structure, the film creepily conjures up  many of the basic anxieties and dreads humans are prone to such as fear of  the dark, of being hopelessly lost in an isolated environment, of  unidentifiable noises on which one can project one's greatest terrors, of  total loss of control against an unknown and malevolent force.Even more  impressive is the way the film expands to become a study of the human  psyche when it is placed into a situation of unspeakable fear and  desperation. As the characters begin to grasp the gravity of their  situation, the forced jocularity begins to be stripped away revealing the  childlike terror, guilt, need for recrimination and eventually despair and  hopelessness that overtake them. The actors are brilliant in capturing the  full gamut of emotions these characters must go through before the  preordained tragic end. The film also provides a slyly satirical spin on  the obsessively cinematic tone of modern life, wherein every event must be  captured on film or videotape, so much so that, even as death is breathing  down the necks of these characters, the cameras continue to roll to record  it. As one of them says in justification, &quot;That's all I have  left.&quot; That is her piece of the comfortable world of familiarity that  helps her, at least momentarily (if futiley), evade the harsh reality of  her situation. Also, these characters pay a high price for the superior  tone of cavalier indifference and almost mockery they display towards the  tales of the legend they have come to &quot;investigate.&quot;More than  any horror film of recent memory, &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; gets  under the viewer's skin and gives one that feeling of creepy vulnerability  that only the best horror films can do.",5,"creepy, original horror film",964310400,"07 23, 2000",2000,2600,"['quot', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'quot', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'fail', 'sheer', 'simplicity', 'conception', 'design', 'allowing', 'tap', 'far', 'more', 'deeply', 'wide', 'range', 'primal', 'fears', 'conventional', 'quot', 'fright', 'quot', 'films', 'churned', 'out', 'regularly', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'latter', 'films', 'tend', 'dilute', 'terror', 'overplotting', 'production', 'reliance', 'special', 'effects', 'quot', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'quot', 'creativity', 'visual', 'inventiveness', 'admirable', 'conviction', 'what', 'left', 'unseen', 'often', 'more', 'terrifying', 'what', 'visualized.The', 'film', 'presents', 'cleverly', 'pseudodocumentary', 'tale', 'group', 'fictional', 'college', 'students', 'who', 'become', 'lost', 'woods', 'endeavoring', 'film', 'study', 'local', 'scary', 'legend', 'structure', 'film', 'creepily', 'up', 'many', 'basic', 'anxieties', 'dreads', 'humans', 'are', 'prone', 'such', 'fear', 'dark', 'being', 'hopelessly', 'lost', 'isolated', 'environment', 'unidentifiable', 'noises', 'one', 'can', 'project', 'one', 'greatest', 'terrors', 'total', 'loss', 'control', 'unknown', 'malevolent', 'force.Even', 'more', 'impressive', 'way', 'film', 'become', 'study', 'human', 'psyche', 'when', 'placed', 'situation', 'unspeakable', 'fear', 'desperation', 'characters', 'begin', 'grasp', 'gravity', 'situation', 'forced', 'jocularity', 'be', 'stripped', 'away', 'revealing', 'childlike', 'terror', 'guilt', 'need', 'recrimination', 'eventually', 'despair', 'hopelessness', 'overtake', 'actors', 'are', 'brilliant', 'capturing', 'full', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'characters', 'must', 'go', 'before', 'preordained', 'tragic', 'end', 'film', 'also', 'slyly', 'satirical', 'spin', 'obsessively', 'cinematic', 'tone', 'modern', 'life', 'wherein', 'event', 'must', 'be', 'captured', 'film', 'videotape', 'so', 'much', 'even', 'death', 'breathing', 'down', 'necks', 'characters', 'cameras', 'continue', 'roll', 'record', 'one', 'justification', 'quot', 'have', 'left.', 'quot', 'piece', 'comfortable', 'world', 'familiarity', 'least', 'momentarily', 'futiley', 'evade', 'harsh', 'reality', 'situation', 'Also', 'characters', 'pay', 'high', 'price', 'superior', 'tone', 'cavalier', 'indifference', 'almost', 'mockery', 'display', 'tales', 'legend', 'have', 'come', 'quot', 'quot', 'More', 'horror', 'film', 'recent', 'memory', 'quot', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'quot', 'viewer', 'skin', 'one', 'feeling', 'creepy', 'vulnerability', 'only', 'best', 'horror', 'films', 'can', 'do']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

Thumb through a copy of Grimm's Brothers folk tales, or watch the film The Wizard of Oz. In these stories, the witch  personifies the chthonic forces of Nature, which can be confronted and  transformed into usable energy for the hero(ine) and society.  Usually the  protagonist accomplishes this transformation by meeting helpers on the way,  but finding the helpers requires an open heart, an aware mind, and the  necessary respect and reverence for the larger powers inhabiting the  wild.......In this story the protagonists are self-absorbed, irreverent,  and extremely undisciplined physically, emotionally, and morally.  They  enter the woods as if it is just another playground.  Such do not fare well  on the journey through the Underworld.  The so-called project is quite  self-referential--it's more about the lead woman in her search for the  witch than it is about the witch herself......These people are so blind  that they cannot use what helps are available to lead them to safety, that  is, the river and the sun.  The trap they fall into is really the trap of  their own overblown egos, which the woods turns against them......This  could well be the story of the modern day Everyman, who sees Nature as a  stage for his own self-serving production, rather than as the intermediary  source of our Being.....",5,"an ancient story with a modern, cautionary twist",946598400,"12 31, 1999",1999,1421,"['One', 'most', 'enduring', 'Western', 'folk', 'tale', 'motifs', 'do', 'woods/wildernesses', 'witches', 'Thumb', 'copy', 'Grimm', 'Brothers', 'folk', 'tales', 'watch', 'film', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'stories', 'witch', 'chthonic', 'forces', 'Nature', 'can', 'be', 'confronted', 'transformed', 'usable', 'energy', 'hero', 'ine', 'society', 'Usually', 'protagonist', 'transformation', 'meeting', 'helpers', 'way', 'finding', 'helpers', 'open', 'heart', 'aware', 'mind', 'necessary', 'respect', 'reverence', 'larger', 'powers', 'inhabiting', 'wild', '.In', 'story', 'protagonists', 'are', 'self-absorbed', 'irreverent', 'extremely', 'undisciplined', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'morally', 'enter', 'woods', 'just', 'playground', 'Such', 'do', 'not', 'fare', 'well', 'journey', 'Underworld', 'so-called', 'project', 'quite', 'self-referential', 'more', 'lead', 'woman', 'search', 'witch', 'witch', 'herself', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'use', 'what', 'are', 'available', 'lead', 'safety', 'river', 'sun', 'trap', 'fall', 'really', 'trap', 'own', 'overblown', 'egos', 'woods', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'story', 'modern', 'day', 'Everyman', 'who', 'Nature', 'stage', 'own', 'self-serving', 'production', 'rather', 'intermediary', 'source', 'Being', '..']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

469727,A1ERDXS0QLEVKB,6305568901,rzaster,"[1, 3]","""The Blair Witch Project"" is certainly not the worst of movies that I have seen; it's nowhere near the top of the list of the movies that I disliked. I think that the main reason did not like this film is because of the way that it was shot. The film was produced as a documentary to give the viewer a feel that what is going on the story actually happened. In fact, the movie is supposed to be a tape that was found by the documenters. I'll get into the plot, which involves the documenters in a little bit. If you get sick or naseous from watching something that seems to be all over the place then this film is not for you. There is no control over the camera as it wobbles.; but all of this was done so the feel of the film would be more realistic. And it worked, as a matter of fact.The plot is very, very simple but is not that great. A group of teenagers wander off into the woods for a search of a mythical witch for a project. The movie documents the travels of the teens, the documenters, through the woods and this is what you will be watching for the running time of the film until the climax.This film is not scary unless your mind easily scares yourself. In the movie you see absolutely nothing that is scary; you don't even see the Blair Witch. Any horror will not be triggered by scary images but by your mind processing certain clues as to what is happening. If your mind does this then you will be very scared. If not, you'll have a good time laughing throughout the movie.Why did I give the movie just two stars? I didn't like the documentary type feel in the production of the movie and the acting was not all that great. If this film had a bigger budget, better acting talent, and a plot that was a bit more believable then this movie would probably be one of the biggest horor movies ever produced. Unfortunately, none of the above was put into effect.Happy Viewing!",2,Only Scary if Your Want to Be Scared,1025049600,"06 26, 2002",2002,1888,"['Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'certainly', 'not', 'worst', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'nowhere', 'top', 'list', 'movies', 'disliked', 'think', 'main', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'way', 'was', 'shot', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'documentary', 'give', 'viewer', 'feel', 'what', 'going', 'story', 'actually', 'happened', 'fact', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'tape', 'was', 'found', 'documenters', ""'ll"", 'get', 'plot', 'documenters', 'little', 'bit', 'get', 'sick', 'naseous', 'watching', 'something', 'be', 'place', 'then', 'film', 'not', 'control', 'camera', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'feel', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'realistic', 'worked', 'matter', 'fact.The', 'plot', 'very', 'very', 'simple', 'not', 'great', 'group', 'teenagers', 'wander', 'woods', 'search', 'mythical', 'witch', 'project', 'movie', 'documents', 'travels', 'teens', 'documenters', 'woods', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'climax.This', 'film', 'not', 'scary', 'mind', 'easily', 'movie', 'see', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'scary', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Any', 'horror', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'triggered', 'scary', 'images', 'mind', 'processing', 'certain', 'clues', 'what', 'happening', 'mind', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'scared', 'not', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'time', 'laughing', 'movie.Why', 'did', 'give', 'movie', 'just', 'two', 'stars', 'did', ""n't"", 'documentary', 'type', 'feel', 'production', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'had', 'bigger', 'budget', 'better', 'acting', 'talent', 'plot', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'believable', 'then', 'movie', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'one', 'biggest', 'horor', 'movies', 'ever', 'produced', 'Unfortunately', 'none', 'above', 'was', 'put', 'effect.Happy', 'Viewing']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

However, this is one of the most effective horror movies I have ever seen. I can't say it scared me really, but neither could I say it didn't. I never had any troubles sleeping, nor any bad dreams related to it. But, what I can say is it draws you in and draws you in deep. Why is the question.We have all grown up and seen many documentaries. As with Peter Jackson's ""Forgotten Silver"", the look and feel of a documentary used in fiction can trick the mind to believe it is real even if you know better. It is just something conditioned in the mind. Consciously, you know better, subconsciously, you're snared deeper and deeper into the story. Probably the most effectively done story that falls under this category of mock truth was not on film, but on radio, Orson Welle's newsy broadcast of ""War of the Worlds"" which generated a very real nationwide panic.To me, ""The Blair Witch Project"" was very reminiscent of documentary videos seen, among other places, on a TV show I grew up with hosted by Leonard Nimoy called ""In Search Of:"". In fact, Blair Witch, to me, 'felt' much like several documentary videos I have seen of the search for 'Bigfoot' or, the yeti. I recall one in which they turned on their recording gear in the night because of strange animalistic sounds in very close proximity and totally surrounding their camp. Who knows, that may have even been part of Blair Witch's inspiration. Regardless, I say excellent job to its production crew in capturing such a genuine feel and making it so effectively 'creepy'.And a little hint about the nature of the nay sayers. They are usually the ones whose nails lost the greatest length while watching the movie they will later say 'stunk'. I know this from watching many like that. Watch them, it's hilarious. Video it, it's priceless. Much of my volunteer work with animals required the ditching of my 'male ego' as a liability. So I find it hilarious to see how much it dominates others and their image.",5,"Forget ego clouded reviews, this film is in one word - Effective",1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,2087,"['Ego', 'clouds', 'many', 'reviews', 'film', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'lot', 'hype', 'had', 'dwindled', 'off', 'However', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'scared', 'really', 'could', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'never', 'had', 'troubles', 'sleeping', 'bad', 'dreams', 'related', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'draws', 'deep', 'Why', 'question.We', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'seen', 'many', 'documentaries', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Forgotten', 'Silver', 'look', 'feel', 'documentary', 'used', 'fiction', 'can', 'trick', 'mind', 'believe', 'real', 'even', 'know', 'better', 'just', 'something', 'conditioned', 'mind', 'Consciously', 'know', 'better', 'subconsciously', ""'re"", 'snared', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'story', 'Probably', 'most', 'effectively', 'done', 'story', 'category', 'mock', 'truth', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'radio', 'Orson', 'Welle', 'newsy', 'broadcast', 'War', 'Worlds', 'generated', 'very', 'real', 'nationwide', 'panic.To', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'was', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'documentary', 'videos', 'seen', 'other', 'places', 'TV', 'show', 'grew', 'up', 'hosted', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'called', 'Search', 'fact', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'much', 'several', 'documentary', 'videos', 'have', 'seen', 'search', ""'Bigfoot"", 'yeti', 'recall', 'one', 'turned', 'recording', 'gear', 'night', 'strange', 'animalistic', 'sounds', 'very', 'close', 'proximity', 'totally', 'surrounding', 'camp', 'Who', 'may', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'part', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'inspiration', 'Regardless', 'say', 'excellent', 'job', 'production', 'crew', 'capturing', 'genuine', 'feel', 'making', 'so', 'effectively', ""'creepy'.And"", 'little', 'hint', 'nature', 'nay', 'sayers', 'are', 'usually', 'ones', 'nails', 'lost', 'greatest', 'length', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'later', 'say', 'know', 'watching', 'many', 'Watch', 'hilarious', 'Video', 'priceless', 'Much', 'volunteer', 'work', 'animals', 'required', 'ditching', ""'male"", 'ego', 'liability', 'find', 'hilarious', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'others', 'image']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

What is more funny is I'm influenced opposite of what others say.  I heard a ton of crap about this movie, after it had been out for a while, the week it came out it was the bee's knees of horror film.  I watched this movie exactly 10 years after it came out and the day before I watched it I was still hearing how horrible this movie was when ever other horror movie was mentioned.  THAT is how influential this movie is, it ALWAYS comes up in a conversation on scary movies.  But it is always said how lame this movie was, not crap-your-pants-keep-the-lights-on-until-morning-for-a-week scary it was.--DISCLAIMER--You will notice that the people that were not scared by this movie watched it with a large group of people that TALKED their way through it.  Those who watched it with a few people that were silent through out were freaked out by it.  Those that watched it alone with the lights out were scared for life.--END OF DISCLAIMER--I did the later, I gave the movie the benefit of the doubt and watched it alone one weekend with all the lights out.  Needless to say the sounds on the disc menu before starting the movie is enough to keep me up till day light with all the lights on.  It was such a sneak attack for me, I did this because I thought it was going to be a lame snore fest.  I was wrong, and now I have to live with it for the remainder of my life hoping I simply end or an all mighty creator burns it out of my brain.Strangely enough when I went to watch it, on it's 10 year anniversary, I could not find a copy, anywhere.  I think it was the first thing I downloaded illegally.  I saw it at Target this year for $4.99.  I feel guilty for stealing since it accomplished it's goal on me so so well, but I didn't even want to pick the case up.  I'm renting it on netflix, keeping it for a day, not watching it, and then sending it back to make up for this though.

Then, they all thought it was dumb!  How stupid is this country anyway?  How could anyone think this was real?  Like footage of some mystical being slaughtering three kids is something they'd just throw into the theaters for you to kick back and eat popcorn to.  Well, I guess the film makers succeeded in what they were going for;  They made a film for about two bucks and made a mint.Personally, I don't see what's so scary about this.  Maybe I've been desensitized over the years by the number of horror films I've seen.  I do admire the effort.  These guys made a blockbuster out of practically nothing(just like Night Of The Living Dead in the 60s).  But, after watching it, I just didn't think it was much of anything.  I saw it in the theater before the hype(thank god), and the film only took up about half of the screen.  I was wondering when the rest of the friggin' movie was gonna come on.  For the most part, this movie is about an hour and a half of bickering, arguing, running screaming into the darkness at the sounds of a shaking bush(who on God's green earth would go running blindly into the pitch black woods if they saw or heard something scary?  Especially if you were lost anyway?), two or three ""creepy"" moments, and a not-so-grande finale.  I had no sympathy for these ... kids.  I didn't give a rat's behind if they were Blair Witch-ed or not.  Throughout the film, our ... heroes are supposed to be lost and walking in circles.

Then I watched it  again, and again, and again, and became (painfully) aware that it is,  indeed, one of the most effectively psychologically damaging films that I  have ever seen.  Why?  Because you never, ever get to see who or what is  out there doing this to these people.  Without a visible bad guy, the  imagination of the viewer is allowed to wander in any direction, most  likely toward the viewer's most inate fears.  And for God's sake, I don't  care how cool you think you are: if you woke up in the morning and found  your camping partner's teeth bound up in a bunch of sticks, you'd be pretty  justified in freaking out.Now, I am not a wimp when it comes to films.  I've sat through Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Exorcist (yawn),  all of them, countless times.  Not one film has ever done to me what this  film did.

469753,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,6305568901,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[2, 3]","By now the story of ""The Blair Witch Project"" is probably familiar to everybody who even remotely follows movies: three student filmmakers journey into the woods with a load of camping gear and handheld filming equipment to record a documentary on the local legend of the Blair Witch.  There, they encounter the terrifyingly supernatural - or do they? - and their ordeal is caught on tape.Most of what they actually see is never captured on film - the result of the darkness of the woods, the occurence of phenomena at night when everyone's asleep until it happens and the cameras are off, etc.  A lot of great horror movies culminate in grand finales that finally give some kind of explanation as to what's been happening; this isn't one of them.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" achieves its greatness in a different way, getting progressively more enigmatic instead of less as it approaches the end, and remaining completely believable even during (in fact partly because of) the seemingly almost unexplainable paradoxes.  But if you need definitive answers at the end of a movie, then admittedly you may not be captivated by the Blair Witch.As an example of the paradoxes, as they attempt to move through the forest in a straight line one sometimes gets the impression the characters are moving in circles.  To me it didn't come off as indicating that the characters were stupid, or that there was a mistake in the filmmaking; but that something truly something truly outside the ken of normal human experience is happening, and that there's a danger in these woods more intangible than a physical prescence, which may or may not exist in conjunction with this bizarre warpishness.  The fact that they continue filming throughout the nightmare did not come off as preposterous, which it certainly could have if not handled correctly.  Instead, cut off and pretty much defenceless, with no understanding of what's happening and unable to perform what should (were things normal) be the relatively uncomplicated task of escaping from the forest, the camera is their link to sanity, to record and in less ominous moments - should any materialize - to try and understand what's going on about them.  It's also not dissimilar to explorers lost in the Antarctic or such places, suspecting they may never get home, continuing to record events in their logs and diaries.  A scene in ""Blair Witch"" in particular that really brings the horror home is where the girl is looking right into the camera and addressing her family and her friends's families directly.Without giving anything away (which would be somewhat hard to do with a movie that leaves so much open to the individual's own interpretation) the end moments contain some of the most chilling and unforgettable images and suggestions in horror history, and fit perfectly with the rest of the film.Horror has a long history of tales told in this 'recording' manner, including the novel ""Dracula"" being told entirely through journal entries and the like.  It was inevitable that in the age of video cameras and the like this kind of plot device would find its way into horror movies as well.  Probably most people are familiar with the movie ""The Last Broadcast"" which actually came out a bit before this (althouh I'm not saying ""Blair Witch"" is a ripoff).  There's also ""The St. Francisville Experiment"", which is about a documentary crew trying to film ghosts in a house rumored to be haunted - very good movie, although not on level with this.  A couple of others that tread the same approximate ground which I haven't gotten yet but plan to are ""Red File 66-095: Strawberry Estates"" and ""The Wicksboro Incident"", which I thought I'd mention because other Blair Witch fans might also want to give them a look.",5,"Mystery, Paradoxes And Terror",1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,3759,"['now', 'story', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'probably', 'familiar', 'everybody', 'who', 'even', 'remotely', 'movies', 'three', 'student', 'filmmakers', 'journey', 'woods', 'load', 'camping', 'gear', 'handheld', 'filming', 'equipment', 'record', 'documentary', 'local', 'legend', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'encounter', 'terrifyingly', 'supernatural', 'do', 'ordeal', 'caught', 'tape.Most', 'what', 'actually', 'see', 'never', 'captured', 'film', 'result', 'darkness', 'woods', 'occurence', 'phenomena', 'night', 'when', 'everyone', 'asleep', 'cameras', 'are', 'off', 'etc', 'lot', 'great', 'horror', 'movies', 'culminate', 'grand', 'finales', 'finally', 'give', 'kind', 'explanation', 'what', 'been', 'happening', ""n't"", 'one', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'greatness', 'different', 'way', 'getting', 'progressively', 'more', 'enigmatic', 'instead', 'less', 'end', 'remaining', 'completely', 'believable', 'even', 'fact', 'partly', 'seemingly', 'almost', 'unexplainable', 'paradoxes', 'need', 'definitive', 'answers', 'end', 'movie', 'then', 'admittedly', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'captivated', 'Blair', 'Witch.As', 'example', 'paradoxes', 'attempt', 'move', 'forest', 'straight', 'line', 'one', 'sometimes', 'impression', 'characters', 'are', 'moving', 'circles', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'indicating', 'characters', 'were', 'stupid', 'was', 'mistake', 'filmmaking', 'something', 'truly', 'something', 'truly', 'ken', 'normal', 'human', 'experience', 'happening', 'danger', 'woods', 'more', 'intangible', 'physical', 'prescence', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'exist', 'conjunction', 'bizarre', 'warpishness', 'fact', 'continue', 'filming', 'nightmare', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'preposterous', 'certainly', 'could', 'have', 'not', 'handled', 'correctly', 'Instead', 'cut', 'off', 'pretty', 'much', 'defenceless', 'understanding', 'what', 'happening', 'unable', 'perform', 'what', 'should', 'were', 'things', 'normal', 'be', 'relatively', 'uncomplicated', 'task', 'escaping', 'forest', 'camera', 'link', 'sanity', 'record', 'less', 'ominous', 'moments', 'should', 'materialize', 'try', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'also', 'not', 'dissimilar', 'explorers', 'lost', 'Antarctic', 'such', 'places', 'suspecting', 'may', 'never', 'get', 'home', 'continuing', 'record', 'events', 'logs', 'diaries', 'scene', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'particular', 'really', 'horror', 'home', 'where', 'girl', 'looking', 'right', 'camera', 'addressing', 'family', 'friends', 'families', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'would', 'be', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'do', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'open', 'individual', 'own', 'interpretation', 'end', 'moments', 'contain', 'most', 'chilling', 'unforgettable', 'images', 'suggestions', 'horror', 'history', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'rest', 'film.Horror', 'long', 'history', 'tales', 'told', ""'recording"", 'manner', 'including', 'novel', 'Dracula', 'being', 'told', 'entirely', 'journal', 'entries', 'like', 'was', 'inevitable', 'age', 'video', 'cameras', 'like', 'kind', 'plot', 'device', 'would', 'find', 'way', 'horror', 'movies', 'well', 'Probably', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'familiar', 'movie', 'Last', 'Broadcast', 'actually', 'came', 'out', 'bit', 'althouh', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'ripoff', 'also', 'St.', 'Francisville', 'Experiment', 'documentary', 'crew', 'trying', 'film', 'ghosts', 'house', 'rumored', 'be', 'haunted', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'level', 'couple', 'others', 'tread', 'same', 'approximate', 'ground', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'yet', 'plan', 'are', 'Red', 'File', '66-095', 'Strawberry', 'Estates', 'Wicksboro', 'Incident', 'thought', ""'d"", 'mention', 'other', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'fans', 'might', 'also', 'want', 'give', 'look']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

469759,A1P5HSM15HWNWV,6305568901,"Steve ""xtcr7""","[2, 6]","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  Most people either loved it or hated it; middle ground is not an optional piece of territory.  I loved it.  I'll tell you why.  One word--ingenuity.That about sums it all up for me.  Sure, there's more there, there actually is a deep, dark horror to it, a spoiled seed which could be the starting point of a magnificent mythos, but I think the element which exists in greatest abundance within the world of the mysterious witch is a categorical and clever kind of resourcefulness; it is filmmaking which is so anti-Hollywood that Hollywood was powerless to ignore it.  After all, we are fascinated by what we fear, are we not?  And a bunch of kids with a few cheap digital cameras riding a powerful idea to a box-office gross north of the century mark can be pretty scary to old, stodgy powerbrokers, let me tell you.PROJECT is a faux documentary edited together from reels of footage discovered a year after the disappearance of three young, amateur filmmakers by the names of Heather, Josh, and Mike.  Their goal was to explore the rural legend of the Blair Witch, a supernatural force said to haunt the forest near the township of Burkittsville, Maryland.  Everything is pretty harmless, benign at the beginning; there's a lot of hamming for the cameras, a surplus of joking and chiding at the expense of each member of the trio, and the conducting of interviews with a few of Burkittsville's finest, who recount different aspects of the evil Wiccan lady, a creature they believe is responsible for many missing and mutilated people over the years.  A creepy tone is set with the cool campfire tales related to the documentarians, the most terrifying being the one about Rustin Parr and his malicious slaughter of several children (he eventually comes out of the Black Hills Forest with the chilly enigmatic proclamation ""I'm finally finished"").  But the real action takes place when the group begins to explore the woods; strange things start to show themselves, like odd rock formations, unnatural hanging childlike figures formed from twigs, and the unearthly song of young kids in the distance.As time goes on, the friendly dynamic previously enjoyed by the threesome denigrates into quick decay, the pressure of the foreboding unknown takes a trying toll.  They walk `round and `round the woods, becoming more and more lost, all attempts at orientation null and void.  Adding to the animosity is Heather's seemingly blind ambition; Mike and Josh just want to figure a way out of the mess, but she is unflappably determined to continue with her thesis, caring more about photographing the twilight-zone incidents they encounter than with formulating a plan of escape.  One of them is marked and then taken by the witch; the remaining duo eventually happen upon a most haunted house and an extremely blood-shocking horror hidden inside.Perhaps the most intriguing construct of the film is the fascinating high-concept idea at the lowest level: imagine what clues one would find on media generated by people missing for a long, long time.  When I first read the tagline promoting the project, I was immediately struck by the utter perplexing nature of such a springboard; it filled me with a bursting sense of curiosity which would have to be satisfied as soon as possible.  The next vital component is the main mechanism of presentation: the documentary format (or, the documentary of the documentary format, at the least).  Upon first inspection, it works; it takes you fully in and makes you feel as if you are watching a nonfiction account of what happened in the woods.  However, upon subsequent viewings, it should be noted that some flaws not previously noticed eventually become conspicuous; these shortcomings aren't necessarily specific, tangible things, they tend to be more abstract in nature.  Simply put, the first time around, you accept the film as an investigative exercise in reconstruction of a potential crime scene, it is nothing more contrived than that; but, as one becomes increasingly familiar with the work, a sense of staging and plotting is made apparent, ruining somewhat the magic of the virginal viewing.  In fact, the issue of the missing map is something that probably should not have been included, as that became a point where the viewer definitely intimated an intrusion of an obviously fictional hand upon the desired effect of verite.  (Going into the film, I thought I was going to see a narrated, paranormal-type show one might find on the History Channel at Halloween time; in some ways, I think this would have been a more ideal route, although not by much- for the most part, PROJECT's design does its job.)The acting talents of the three main players are finely suited for the nature of the material.  Of particular note is Heather Donahue, who seems to have a disproportionate amount of training and polish in relation to the other two; but this can sometimes work to her detriment, since too skillful a job can detract from the insouciant, unconscious demeanor that a director would want to see in this kind of a role.  Remember, these are three ordinary kids under extraordinary circumstances; it would not do for any of them to suddenly show off any sort of technique learned from an educational institute- instead, the ""everyman"" approach is best.  There probably was a bit of overacting at times, particularly when the arguments really started to rise along the temperature gradient, but it was kept to an acceptable minimum.But let me go back to where I began: I just loved the genius level of this movie.  We don't have a lot of money, so let's scare the pants off of everybody by devising an invisible menace, let's play with the minds of the audience and make them gasp by giving them high-resolution terrors instead of complex CGI algorithms.

It is one of the first hand held camera film mockumentary flicks that resulted in a tirade of mockumentaries, the recovered footage genre, including District 9, Apollo 18, and [REC]. The hand held camera work is at first interesting and then nauseating and you wish they could keep it still. The ordinary production is all part of the set up to the famous ending that still makes me shudder. It is the creepy atmosphere and odd feel of the film that makes it scary, rather than what is said or the actual events.The fear in the eyes of the players is quite disturbing as they look genuinely terrified. This translates to the audience also and one never knows what to expect next. The dialogue is virtually improvised and even the actors do not know what is going on adding to the morbid fear. As such this is a curio that is worth seeing once and then perhaps forgetting.The realism of the content, as though someone left a camera running and now we are seeing it unfold, was an innovative idea but has since been flogged to death.

Now you see these online viral ad campaigns everywhere, all in part have to thank the Blair Witch movie. remember 1999 was still new to online information, Yahoo was coming around and there was the big Website boom, look how far we come now with the Net.And the whole documentary style film making is not new, the film makers have alot to owe to the Italian Cannibal movies Cannibal Holocaust for the inspiration, where that film an anthropologist finds lost footage of a trio of film makers that disappeared in the jungles of the Amazon. This film was made back in the early 80s. So this kind of style is not new.The movie itself is shot in grainy black and white, and showing no gore no violence, everything is implied. At night in the woods all alone, your mind can take over, hearing every little twig break, every leaf rustle, will make your hairs stand on end. It's this simplicity that makes the film work. There's a scene where the three filmmakers are in the tent and they hear strange sounds coming from the woods and they shine a flash light out in the the black abyss and it doesn't penetrate nothing, the light, doesn't illuminate who or what is out there, total blackness is all around them and it's only then they feel most vulnerable, the filmmakers playing on everyone's general fear of the unknown, the darkness and one cannot anticipate early morning that much faster to make it safe again with the daylight. i want to say it's also a character driven movie, the interactions between the trio of documentary filmmakers and the stress they are put through as they get lost deeper and deeper into the Maryland wilderness.

Scream (crap), Urban legends (Yawn) I know what you did last summer (definitely crap), Final Destination and its subsequent crappie sequeals (Blahhh)Blair witch is a rare gem for us who grew up in the 90s and got bombarded with crap movies like I mentioned, this one was a diamond in the ruff.

It can have it's  caustrophobic effects on you as well.  As stupid as this may sound, there  were also some aestetic moments in Blair Witch, like when it was raining  and you could see the soft, dewy raindrops cascade against the pine trees.

One decided flaw in the film is  the constant usage of profane dialogue (137 'F' words were counted  altogether). You don't need to be a censor to realize it gets to be  obtrusive. Due to the incredible popularity the film had gained, its  fiction is no longer a secret, which takes away a good deal of it's  effectiveness (Imagine if what you were watching was real).

I gave the movie an extra star because this movie was entirely original when it came out, no one had ever seen anything like it before. let me go over a few things you will want to know before you buy/rent:1) The movie was made for only $40,000. There are NO special effects, no known actors (in fact, the main cast is only 3 people), no pro lighting, and was filmed with handheld cameras (complete with jerky camerawork).2) the profanity in the movie has been much criticized. Most seem to think its because the actors couldn't come up with anything original and creative, so they just kept swearing. I totally disagree. The way the actors talk in this movie is HOW PEOPLE TALK. Ever overhear two people talking? They swear like there's no tomorrow! The conversations in the movie sound like 3 20 year olds talking, which is what its supposed to be.3) The film is not very scary through most of it. Original, yes! Scary, no. The last 5 minutes, however, are in my opinion the scariest minutes of film ever shot. EVER. I don't get scared by movies, and I felt like I was going to have a heart attack watching those 5 minutes. DEFINITELY worth viewing the movie for.4) This movie is incredibly original....but thats not to say that original is always good. The movie drags a bit, only because most of it involves the principal actors endlessly bickering with each other. It gets pretty old pretty fast. However, that doesn't negate the fact that this was an important film (breathing new life into the horror genre) and an overall good (not great) movie.5) The acting is not great. Its certainly ok, just don't expect a DeNiro 'Raging Bull' tour de force. You won't get it here.If you haven't seen this movie, you REALLY SHOULD see it.

People seem to love this movie or absolutely hate it.  My first knowledge of this film was a brief blurb from Roger Ebert talking about an upcoming film and he showed footage from the Blair Witch Project of people running and screaming in the woods at night.  My first thought was, &quot;Is this a student film?&quot;It never occurred to me that the film was real, even though it was marketed that way, and even though I saw the Sci-Fi Channel's excellent Curse of the Blair Witch special, all before seeing the actual film in the theater.  The reason I mention all of this is because I think a lot of people resent being hoodwinked into thinking the events they were watching were real.  To that I ask &quot;So, you paid money to see a snuff film and now you are disappointed?&quot;  As the credits rolled in the theater I heard more than one group of people note the actors names and say &quot;See, I told you it was real&quot;.  At that moment they loved the movie.  People had been jumping out of their seats and hiding their eyes.  Imagine their disappointment when they found out the people on the screen weren't dead.  I bet they were angry enough to trash it to anyone who would listen.  My two closest friends in the world did EXACTLY that.  They both admitted liking it until they found out it was just a movie.  Now they talk about how it was the worst movie ever.  Why the change?I guess I should actually review this DVD.  Despite my original worries, this is not a student film, although it was certainly made on a student budget with student equipment.  The 3 unknown actors were simply more convincing than any $20 million per picture actor that has hoisted an Oscar.  Remember, people watched this and thought it actually happened.The plot was simple; Three students go into the Maryland woods near Burkittsville to investigate sites haunted by a local urban legend, the Blair Witch.  They get lost, they find more than they expected, weird noises surround them, someone disappears, and it culminates in a search of the ultimate Blair Witch location.The DVD is great, not only for it's special features including a great commentary track, but it also features the full length Sci-Fi mock documentary Curse of the Blair Witch, which gives background on the &quot;myth&quot; of the witch and &quot;interviews&quot; with people with knowledge of the legend.Please, if you have not seen this movie, watch it with watching a work of fiction in mind.  As a movie, it is spooky, and the isolation and building terror of the cast will draw you in.  There's nothing that will change the monds of people who watched the film with the wrong mindset.  Instead, I urge you to see it for what it is; a very good, scary film.",5,"Love it, or hate it",1081382400,"04 8, 2004",2004,2851,"['Sift', 'thru', 'more', '1700', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'time', 'write', ""'ll"", 'see', 'lot', '1', 'star', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'People', 'seem', 'love', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'My', 'first', 'knowledge', 'film', 'was', 'brief', 'blurb', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'talking', 'upcoming', 'film', 'showed', 'footage', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'people', 'running', 'screaming', 'woods', 'night', 'My', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'quot', 'student', 'film', 'quot', 'never', 'occurred', 'film', 'was', 'real', 'even', 'was', 'marketed', 'way', 'even', 'saw', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'excellent', 'Curse', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'special', 'seeing', 'actual', 'film', 'theater', 'reason', 'mention', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'resent', 'being', 'hoodwinked', 'thinking', 'events', 'were', 'watching', 'were', 'real', 'ask', 'quot', 'So', 'paid', 'money', 'see', 'snuff', 'film', 'now', 'are', 'disappointed', 'quot', 'credits', 'rolled', 'theater', 'heard', 'more', 'one', 'group', 'people', 'note', 'actors', 'names', 'say', 'quot', 'See', 'told', 'was', 'real', 'quot', 'moment', 'loved', 'movie', 'People', 'had', 'been', 'jumping', 'seats', 'hiding', 'eyes', 'Imagine', 'disappointment', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'people', 'screen', 'were', ""n't"", 'dead', 'bet', 'were', 'angry', 'enough', 'trash', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'listen', 'two', 'closest', 'friends', 'world', 'did', 'EXACTLY', 'admitted', 'liking', 'found', 'was', 'just', 'movie', 'Now', 'talk', 'how', 'was', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'Why', 'change', 'guess', 'should', 'actually', 'review', 'DVD', 'original', 'worries', 'not', 'student', 'film', 'was', 'certainly', 'made', 'student', 'budget', 'student', 'equipment', '3', 'unknown', 'actors', 'were', 'simply', 'more', 'convincing', '20', 'million', 'picture', 'actor', 'hoisted', 'Oscar', 'Remember', 'people', 'watched', 'thought', 'actually', 'happened.The', 'plot', 'was', 'simple', 'Three', 'students', 'go', 'Maryland', 'woods', 'Burkittsville', 'investigate', 'sites', 'haunted', 'local', 'urban', 'legend', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'get', 'lost', 'find', 'more', 'expected', 'weird', 'noises', 'surround', 'someone', 'disappears', 'search', 'ultimate', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'location.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'not', 'only', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'great', 'commentary', 'track', 'also', 'full', 'length', 'Sci-Fi', 'mock', 'documentary', 'Curse', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'background', 'quot', 'quot', 'witch', 'quot', 'interviews', 'quot', 'people', 'knowledge', 'legend.Please', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'watch', 'watching', 'work', 'fiction', 'mind', 'movie', 'spooky', 'isolation', 'building', 'terror', 'cast', 'will', 'draw', 'nothing', 'will', 'change', 'monds', 'people', 'who', 'watched', 'film', 'wrong', 'mindset', 'Instead', 'urge', 'see', 'what', 'very', 'good', 'scary', 'film']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

But the show must be both believable and entertaining at the same time.Blair Witch Project takes an original, but generally unsuccessful try at it. When the film came out, it made use of 'viral marketing', i.e. using the Internet to essentially create an fabricated urban legend to convince people, by word-of-mouth, that the the story of a film crew that mysteriously vanished was true.As a result, a mini-sensation occurred that propelled what is essentially a student-grade film, into the mainstream. Some people, just like those listening to Welles in 1938, were convinced the story was true.But once the film is taken out of this sensational environment, what is left is a pretty banal, torpid film. The movie is a lot like watching somebody's vacation video. In fact, the film could be titled 'Lost in the Woods', since it seems most of the middle part of the movie focused on the fact the trio couldn't find their way back. The psychological aspect of the movie is interesting, but not enough to compel somebody to watch it strictly for entertainment purposes.With the Internet/urban legend hullabaloo stripped away, Blair Witch Project is shown to be what it is - a film that is mildly interesting and not very entertaining.

Bad movies you tend to stay away from. But that isn't the case with Blair Witch. Not for me. This movie reeked. It was  atrocious. And yet I'll probably watch it everytime it comes on. Probably  because it's so bad that it's entertaining. The acting, while not the worst  I've seen, isn't very good. Heather Donahue does her best, but the other  two guys are repetitive, babbling...  It's no wonder Hollywood ain't  exactly knocking down their doors for acting gigs.As for the fright  factor? There is none. I've heard some people say this was the most  terrifying movie they've ever seen. I suppose they never saw the Exorcist,  but everybody's entitled to their opinion. I'm just curious as to why  anybody would say that. Is it because the movie looked &quot;real&quot;? It  was also horribly acted, which kills off any connection to reality in my  opinion.  Is it because the threat is never shown? So basically you'd be  scaring yourself to death. That's not the mark of a good movie, that's an  overactive imagination.  The mark of a good film to me is one that makes  you feel what the characters are feeling, and I never got the honest  impression that any of them were scared.

469785,A243HY69GIAHFI,6305568901,tropic_of_criticism,"[0, 1]","The triumph of this movie is not the story it tells. Rather, it is the uplift it must give to the hearts of small filmmakers everywhere.  If this can enter the $100 Million Club then surely their better-crafted pieces must have a chance of making serious profit margins as well.This storyline is as implausible as Ricky Martin selling out a stadium to an audience of people who are there for his &quot;artistic integrity.&quot; My pet mouse following the scent of cheese five miles away would've had a better chance of getting out of the woods than these morons.  It just makes no sense that the &quot;woods&quot; could've been more than a thicket in densely-populated Maryland.  What rural plot of land in Maryland wouldn't be completely transversable in a day, walking slowly?  And even if worse came to worse, were these people so INCREDIBLY stupid that they couldn't have marked their trail?  Some might well say that by the end they were so exhausted and delirious that rational thought wouldn't have occurred to them.  But this is a bankrupt theory.  One of the people might've broken down in this way.  Two, maybe.  But all three of them so completely fogged over that they couldn't put together a logical plan for...WALKING?Ahhh, but what about the witch, I hear you saying?  Did she not change the shape of space-time around the woods so as to make it impossible to walk out?  Did she not cast a spell upon them to make them forget basic navigational skills? Please.  It's impossible to walk out because the filmmakers NEED it to be impossible to walk out.  This magical property of the woods is the _deus ex machina_ of the plot, and the story is inevitably cheapened by it.Oh, sure: the ending rescues the filmmaker's credibility. They do know how to induce terror in an audience, however briefly. And this &quot;payoff&quot; is the result of some convincingly-acted character metamorphoses.  But throughout the vast wasteland that was the film's setup we in truth learn only two things: 1) the filmmakers disregard their audience's intelligence and 2) $20 is an awful lot of money for a movie we could've seen at the dollar theatre downtown.What's amazing to me about this film was how it depended upon its website and media hype to tell its story.  Exceptionally clever marketing, of course, but bad storytelling.  If you had no access to the media before you went to see it, the film would be all but incomprehensible.  Without the hip website, and background documentary, you've really got nothing of substance in the film. Since the marketing was so pervasive and effective, it's hard to imagine doing, but try to conceive of going into a theatre with no prior knoweldge of the film.  My guess is that you'd walk away scratching your head.  I mean, think about it: what happens?  People walk around, people walk around some more, objects are left tentside, and *boom* there's your witch blurring by the camera for thirty seconds.  The ending is scary not because we've been told an engrossing story which feeds us little tidbits along the way to turn the screws of terror in our minds.  It's not scary because it could happen to us.  It's scary because all the marketing TOLD us it was scary.  It's scary because there's a prelude at the beginning of the movie which says that the protagonists snuffed it and after an hour you 'feel' that it's about time for that prelude to come true. Because you know in advance it's not going to end well for our three adventurers, there is no mystery.  And without mystery, there can be no great horror.  There can only be the effect of being on a roller coaster looking down the tracks of the drop that's coming.In fact, this movie reminds me very much of a ride at the Magic Kingdom. Not Space Mountain, which is an ordinary roller coaster made frightening because it's entirely dark.  No this is maybe Splash Mountain.  It's so heavily hyped and all the lines are so long that it must be the best ride EVER.  You see that big flume at the very end of that ride as you're wating in line, and you think this ride is going to be GREAT.  And maybe to some people it is.  But when YOU get on it, you realize it's just a carefully created environment populated by a lot of dancing animatronic bunny rabbits singing a song until the very end, when--briefly--you have the wits scared out of you by what you had already seen on your way in.  And as the car comes back into the station and you wipe the fractional amounts of water from your face, it suddenly hits you: THAT'S what I spent the last hour waiting in line for?There are better ways to go bump in the night, people.",2,This li'l kiddie ride ain't no Space Mountain,956016000,"04 18, 2000",2000,4623,"['triumph', 'movie', 'not', 'story', 'Rather', 'uplift', 'must', 'give', 'hearts', 'small', 'filmmakers', 'everywhere', 'can', 'enter', '100', 'Million', 'Club', 'then', 'surely', 'better-crafted', 'pieces', 'must', 'have', 'chance', 'making', 'serious', 'profit', 'margins', 'well.This', 'storyline', 'as', 'implausible', 'Ricky', 'Martin', 'selling', 'out', 'stadium', 'audience', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'there', 'quot', 'artistic', 'integrity.', 'quot', 'My', 'pet', 'mouse', 'following', 'scent', 'cheese', 'five', 'miles', 'away', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'better', 'chance', 'getting', 'woods', 'morons', 'just', 'sense', 'quot', 'woods', 'quot', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'thicket', 'densely-populated', 'Maryland', 'What', 'rural', 'plot', 'land', 'Maryland', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'completely', 'transversable', 'day', 'walking', 'slowly', 'even', 'worse', 'came', 'worse', 'were', 'people', 'so', 'INCREDIBLY', 'stupid', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'marked', 'trail', 'might', 'well', 'say', 'end', 'were', 'so', 'exhausted', 'delirious', 'rational', 'thought', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'occurred', 'bankrupt', 'theory', 'One', 'people', 'might', ""'ve"", 'broken', 'down', 'way', 'Two', 'maybe', 'three', 'so', 'completely', 'fogged', 'over', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'together', 'logical', 'plan', 'WALKING', 'Ahhh', 'what', 'witch', 'hear', 'saying', 'Did', 'not', 'change', 'shape', 'space-time', 'woods', 'so', 'make', 'impossible', 'walk', 'out', 'Did', 'not', 'cast', 'spell', 'make', 'forget', 'basic', 'navigational', 'skills', 'Please', 'impossible', 'walk', 'out', 'filmmakers', 'NEED', 'be', 'impossible', 'walk', 'out', 'magical', 'property', 'woods', '_deus', 'ex', 'machina_', 'plot', 'story', 'inevitably', 'cheapened', 'it.Oh', 'sure', 'ending', 'filmmaker', 'credibility', 'do', 'know', 'how', 'induce', 'terror', 'audience', 'however', 'briefly', 'quot', 'quot', 'result', 'convincingly-acted', 'character', 'metamorphoses', 'vast', 'wasteland', 'was', 'film', 'setup', 'truth', 'learn', 'only', 'two', 'things', '1', 'filmmakers', 'disregard', 'audience', 'intelligence', '2', '20', 'awful', 'lot', 'money', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dollar', 'theatre', 'downtown.What', 'amazing', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'depended', 'website', 'media', 'hype', 'tell', 'story', 'Exceptionally', 'clever', 'marketing', 'course', 'bad', 'storytelling', 'had', 'access', 'media', 'went', 'see', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'incomprehensible', 'hip', 'website', 'background', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'really', 'got', 'nothing', 'substance', 'film', 'marketing', 'was', 'so', 'pervasive', 'effective', 'hard', 'imagine', 'doing', 'try', 'conceive', 'going', 'theatre', 'prior', 'knoweldge', 'film', 'guess', ""'d"", 'walk', 'away', 'scratching', 'head', 'mean', 'think', 'what', 'People', 'walk', 'people', 'walk', 'more', 'objects', 'are', 'left', 'tentside', '*boom*', 'witch', 'blurring', 'camera', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'ending', 'scary', 'not', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'engrossing', 'story', 'little', 'tidbits', 'way', 'turn', 'screws', 'terror', 'minds', 'not', 'scary', 'could', 'happen', 'scary', 'marketing', 'TOLD', 'was', 'scary', 'scary', 'prelude', 'beginning', 'movie', 'protagonists', 'snuffed', 'hour', ""'feel"", 'time', 'prelude', 'come', 'true', 'know', 'advance', 'not', 'going', 'end', 'well', 'three', 'adventurers', 'mystery', 'mystery', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'horror', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'effect', 'being', 'roller', 'coaster', 'looking', 'down', 'tracks', 'drop', 'coming.In', 'fact', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'ride', 'Magic', 'Kingdom', 'Not', 'Space', 'Mountain', 'ordinary', 'roller', 'coaster', 'made', 'frightening', 'entirely', 'dark', 'maybe', 'Splash', 'Mountain', 'so', 'heavily', 'hyped', 'lines', 'are', 'so', 'long', 'must', 'be', 'best', 'ride', 'EVER', 'see', 'big', 'flume', 'very', 'end', 'ride', ""'re"", 'wating', 'line', 'think', 'ride', 'going', 'be', 'GREAT', 'maybe', 'people', 'when', 'YOU', 'get', 'realize', 'just', 'carefully', 'created', 'environment', 'populated', 'lot', 'dancing', 'animatronic', 'bunny', 'rabbits', 'singing', 'song', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'briefly', 'have', 'wits', 'scared', 'what', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'way', 'car', 'back', 'station', 'wipe', 'fractional', 'amounts', 'water', 'face', 'suddenly', 'what', 'spent', 'last', 'hour', 'waiting', 'line', 'are', 'better', 'ways', 'go', 'bump', 'night', 'people']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

If you don't,look elsewhere.(Maybe Urban Legend 3 will be coming out soon!)Puke! You need to watch this movie alone with the lights out to really be able to take in the eerie atmosphere that this movie creates. This movie delivers tension that I haven't felt since first watching The Exorcist as a teenager back in the early eighties. Many people criticize this movie for the way it was filmed,but for me therein lies the beauty of it. The mood of the film would have been severely hampered by a big production. I love gore films(Dead-Alive,Dawn Of The Dead,The Beyond,City of The Living Dead,just to name a few),but this was one of the few films to actually get under my skin. This film didn't need gore or a big budget,just good acting,a good story,minimal props and a couple of cameras. Part 2 was not worthy as a sequel,but ends up being just another horror movie that I could live with or without. I hear Part 3 is in the making.

With &quot;Run Lola Run&quot;  it was the relenltess pace and non-dependence on dialogue which created a  sublime effect, a near return to the silent era. &quot;Blair Witch&quot;  took the channel's utterly false reality of home-video footage and  documentary-style acting, transforming it into perhaps the most realistic  falseness to ever grace the silver screen. The enormous buzz that  surrounded this amasing horror movie (which never aspires to be more than a  cheeky genre entry) has started an undeserved yet equally strong backlash,  mostly by jealous film-students at first, then by the spoiled masses which  could not comprehend anything beyond Will Smith's special effects-ridden  vehicles. Misunderstood both by the critics who hailed it as the next  cineamtic movement and the audiences bombasted by the hype, &quot;Blair  Witch&quot; should be taken at face value; although currently that is  practically impossible to do. The degree of scariness in the exploits of  three young idiots (types all too familliar to everyone who attended  college) doomed to perish in the hanuted Maryland woods will largely  correspond to one's own level of sensitivity, but regardless of how  frightened the film makes you, it amounts to an experience of gleeful  delight,(akin to the great &quot;Evil Dead&quot; series minus the  cartoonish gore), of taking part in something new and refreshing. Of course  the overall execution is not totally original, deriving mainly from  &quot;The Real World&quot; and an obscure 80's Vietnam flick called  &quot;84 Charle Mopic&quot;, but what does it matter? Nothing, repeat  NOTHING spurts out of the blue - (a classic case in point would be  Tarantino inspired by Goddard and Melville inspired by Carol Reed and John  Huston inspired by the 20's expressionist cinema and early gangster films).  &quot;Blair Witch&quot;, while not transcending its genre, still has a  share of pure visual artistry, some probably unintentional. A certain  beauty lies in the shots of Heather Donahue's white shape jetting through  the dark forest, or the omnious rays of sun glittering in the evening  trees.

This is the film made for him/her, and only that type of person. If this describes you, then buy a copy tout de suite so you can watch it in the company of others. After watching, if they are people who actually watch films in order to be entertained, they will ask, ""Why do so many people like this film? Nothing happened. It's a bunch of annoying, worthless college punks running around in the woods swearing at each other"". You then can put your ""snob"" on and denounce them as ""populace filth"" who cannot grasp the sheer genius of a film where nothing happens on the screen and everything is supposed to be one's imagination. When they leave, you can then throw your copy aside because you will never watch it anyway unless you have the opportunity to belittle those who cannot ""get it"".Another reviewer called this the ""reality show version of a horror film"", and to me, nothing describes this film better or demonstrates exactly what was wrong with the entertainment world in the 1990's as well as that comment. People became burnt-out on the flash and glamour of the 80's and, as with every other concept in human history, decided to go the other extreme and make music that was dull and boring, sung by ugly people (which would had been fine if they had been guitar wizards or something, but their musical skills were by and large pretty horrible too), the models looked like junkies,clothes were so hideous that bums wouldn't wear them now, and the reality show was born.God I hate reality shows. They destroyed decent writing and camera work for at least a generation and gave every freak willing to swallow rat's brains a spotlight usually reserved for people with real talent. Hence, this film was born. The ""actors"" are extremely annoying (as other reviewers have written, the viewer begins to wish for their slow, painful deaths a few minutes into the film), the story was beyond weak and nothing annoyed me more than the lie that the producers put forth that this was some kind of documentary (once again, as someone else has said, how could a camera survive on its own in the elements for a year?), and the jerky, haphazard motion of the camera might very well make you ill.

Before I had ever even seen the movie, I was extremely skeptical and had heard extremely mixed reviews from critics and viewers alike.  I had heard that it only cost about 36,000 dollars to produce this movie and the majority of the comments from viewers indicated that the movie was a total debacle and not suspenseful in the least bit.  But, I nonetheless kept an open, unbiased frame of mind before watching it, wanting to develop my own opinion of it, rather than relying on someone else's.One thing I really like about this movie is it's idea: three people doing a documentary about a legendary witch via asking locals their opinions and tales about it, (using a camcorder) then actually looking for and researching the witch in the forest where it allegedly resided.  The acting is also very convincing -the locals don't talk like they're doing a movie and the three young researchers are very convincing as well.  So in these respects, the movie succeeds.The only problem is that the acting becomes far, far, far too melodramatic and exaggerated, and by the end of the movie I was praying, ANXIOUSLY BEGGING, in fact, for the actors (the young woman and the two young men) to be ruthlessly slaughtered by this alleged witch hunting them in the most malicious, cruel fashion ever seen on film; I began to HATE and DESPISE the research team from the get-go in the forest.  Their constant slews of profanity and bickering and extreme paranoia and panic drove me up a wall and really ruined the movie in a big way.  At least I can say that they were convincing in really believing that they were being hunted and that there really was something ominous in the forest.  The ending didn't provide the deus ex machina, unfortunately (showing all three being viciously mutilated) that I badly desired, but at least it was interesting and fairly suspenseful.While The Blair Witch Project has its major flaws and shortcomings, the idea is at least, fresh and unique and it did end up being fairly suspenseful, but viewing this flic was just a little bit too aggravating with the idiotic teenage reasoning, swearing, and panicking...",3,"Good idea, but unspectacular implementation.",1011139200,"01 16, 2002",2002,2250,"['only', 'recently', 'saw', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'HBO', 'other', 'cable', 'station', 'viewing', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'had', 'ever', 'even', 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'extremely', 'skeptical', 'had', 'heard', 'extremely', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'critics', 'viewers', 'alike', 'had', 'heard', 'only', 'cost', '36,000', 'dollars', 'produce', 'movie', 'majority', 'comments', 'viewers', 'indicated', 'movie', 'was', 'total', 'debacle', 'not', 'suspenseful', 'least', 'bit', 'nonetheless', 'kept', 'open', 'unbiased', 'frame', 'mind', 'watching', 'wanting', 'develop', 'own', 'opinion', 'rather', 'relying', 'someone', ""else's.One"", 'thing', 'really', 'like', 'movie', 'idea', 'three', 'people', 'doing', 'documentary', 'legendary', 'witch', 'asking', 'locals', 'opinions', 'tales', 'using', 'camcorder', 'then', 'actually', 'looking', 'researching', 'witch', 'forest', 'where', 'allegedly', 'resided', 'acting', 'also', 'very', 'convincing', '-the', 'locals', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', ""'re"", 'doing', 'movie', 'three', 'young', 'researchers', 'are', 'very', 'convincing', 'well', 'So', 'respects', 'movie', 'only', 'problem', 'acting', 'becomes', 'far', 'far', 'far', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'exaggerated', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'praying', 'ANXIOUSLY', 'BEGGING', 'fact', 'actors', 'young', 'woman', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'be', 'ruthlessly', 'slaughtered', 'alleged', 'witch', 'hunting', 'most', 'malicious', 'cruel', 'fashion', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'began', 'HATE', 'DESPISE', 'research', 'team', 'get-go', 'forest', 'constant', 'slews', 'profanity', 'bickering', 'extreme', 'paranoia', 'panic', 'drove', 'up', 'wall', 'really', 'ruined', 'movie', 'big', 'way', 'least', 'can', 'say', 'were', 'convincing', 'really', 'believing', 'were', 'being', 'hunted', 'really', 'was', 'something', 'ominous', 'forest', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'provide', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'unfortunately', 'showing', 'three', 'being', 'viciously', 'mutilated', 'badly', 'desired', 'least', 'was', 'interesting', 'fairly', 'suspenseful.While', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'major', 'flaws', 'shortcomings', 'idea', 'least', 'fresh', 'unique', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'fairly', 'suspenseful', 'viewing', 'flic', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'aggravating', 'idiotic', 'teenage', 'reasoning', 'swearing', 'panicking']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS
469808,AP3B615GM191G,6305568901,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","Just recently, I read Stephen King's horror treatise &#34;Danse Macabre&#34;.  In that book, he discusses &#34;The Blair Witch Project&#34; as one of the most frightening movies he has ever seen.  I decided to watch it on that recommendation, and I came away fascinated by the experience.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Blair Witch&#34; focuses on a group of three friends trying to produce an independent documentary about the so-called Blair Witch that haunts the woods surrounding a rural town.  At first, the documentary seems to be going quite while, but when the trio gets lost in the woods and strange things start happening, things take a turn for the worse.Sadly, history will probably only remember this film for the controversy that surrounded it at the theater (people thinking that the documentary was actually a real thing).  While it isn't an all-time classic, to be sure, it does produce some genuine emotion by touching on some very deep themes.Basically, this movie preys on those all-too-human emotions in which the &#34;monster behind the door&#34; (as King himself describes it) is much more scary when it is unseen.  SPOILER ALERT HERE: During the entire entire, viewers never even catch so much as a glimpse of whatever/whoever is causing the strange happenings.  It's the ultimate &#34;devil you don't know&#34; story.Yet, &#34;Blair Witch&#34; also works on a more human-drama level.  Much like the later &#34;Cloverfield&#34;, it is filmed entirely in the shaky-cam style, trying to be as close to human reality as possible.  As the three hikers slowly begin to realize just how hopelessly lost they have become, parts of the film become a sort of character study in panic and emotion.  Viewers begin to wonder &#34;would I react the same way in a similar situation?&#34;Overall, I was more intrigued by &#34;Blair Witch&#34; than anything.  It is amazing to me how a movie so stark and completely devoid of any conjured drama (no soundtrack, no &#34;jump scenes&#34;, etc.) can still be a bit unsettling to watch.  I have also seen the first &#34;Paranormal Activity&#34; movie, and I don't understand why that is viewed with such reverence while &#34;Blair Witch&#34; has to fight for every inch, so to speak.  They are the same type of movie, but this effort actually shows the descent into panic/madness better than &#34;Paranormal&#34; ever did.",3,"A Precursor To ""Paranormal Activity"" (But Probably Even Better At What It Does)",1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,2375,"['Just', 'recently', 'read', 'Stephen', 'King', 'horror', 'treatise', '34', 'Danse', 'Macabre', '34', 'book', '34', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', '34', 'one', 'most', 'frightening', 'movies', 'ever', 'seen', 'decided', 'watch', 'recommendation', 'came', 'away', 'fascinated', 'experience.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', '34', 'Blair', 'Witch', '34', 'focuses', 'group', 'three', 'friends', 'trying', 'produce', 'independent', 'documentary', 'so-called', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'woods', 'surrounding', 'rural', 'town', 'first', 'documentary', 'be', 'going', 'quite', 'when', 'trio', 'lost', 'woods', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'things', 'take', 'turn', 'worse.Sadly', 'history', 'will', 'probably', 'only', 'remember', 'film', 'controversy', 'surrounded', 'theater', 'people', 'thinking', 'documentary', 'was', 'actually', 'real', 'thing', ""n't"", 'all-time', 'classic', 'be', 'sure', 'produce', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'touching', 'very', 'deep', 'themes.Basically', 'movie', 'preys', 'all-too-human', 'emotions', '34', 'monster', 'door', '34', 'King', 'much', 'more', 'scary', 'when', 'unseen', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'HERE', 'entire', 'entire', 'viewers', 'never', 'even', 'catch', 'so', 'much', 'glimpse', 'whatever/whoever', 'causing', 'strange', 'happenings', 'ultimate', '34', 'devil', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', '34', 'story.Yet', '34', 'Blair', 'Witch', '34', 'also', 'more', 'human-drama', 'level', 'Much', 'later', '34', 'Cloverfield', '34', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'shaky-cam', 'style', 'trying', 'be', 'as', 'close', 'human', 'reality', 'possible', 'three', 'hikers', 'slowly', 'begin', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'hopelessly', 'lost', 'have', 'become', 'parts', 'film', 'become', 'sort', 'character', 'study', 'panic', 'emotion', 'Viewers', 'begin', 'wonder', '34', 'would', 'react', 'same', 'way', 'similar', 'situation', '34', 'Overall', 'was', 'more', 'intrigued', '34', 'Blair', 'Witch', '34', 'anything', 'amazing', 'how', 'movie', 'so', 'stark', 'completely', 'devoid', 'conjured', 'drama', 'soundtrack', '34', 'jump', 'scenes', '34', 'etc', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'bit', 'unsettling', 'watch', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'first', '34', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '34', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'viewed', 'such', 'reverence', '34', 'Blair', 'Witch', '34', 'fight', 'inch', 'so', 'speak', 'are', 'same', 'type', 'movie', 'effort', 'actually', 'descent', 'panic/madness', 'better', '34', 'Paranormal', '34', 'ever', 'did']",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS
