Not only is the design and costumes slightly altered, many fan favorite characters have suddenly disappeared without any explanation. Also, a corny sense of humor is injected to try disipate the tedium many Year 1 stories had. It didn't work. Though, if you grew up watching the program when it first came out, one can still find a lot of escapist fun, with Irwin Allen-type Sci-Fi explanations. The production, design and special effects are still top notch. The stories have a more action style tone to them, but the dialogue and acting is certainly questionable. the set is really a mixed bag. Obviously The Metamorph is the best of the lot, introducing Maya, the molecular tranforming sexy alien. The Exiles has it's moments. The Humanity(the one with the androids)story actually feels like a holdover from Year 1. All That Glisters, critised by the entire cast, is really a lot of fun. Martin Landau, fom what I've read, thought this was the nadir or the entire series. Journey to Where is tolerable. And The Taybor, well, you were warned.Still, enjoyment and tolerance of this Set and the program really depends on how non-discriminating you are with cheesy Sci-Fi with a big budget.",3,"""We've picked up a sudden energy charge of enormous thrust!""",1030752000,"08 31, 2002",2002,1257,"['everyone', 'noted', 'Year', '2', 'drastically', 'different', 'Year', '1', 'Not', 'only', 'design', 'costumes', 'slightly', 'altered', 'many', 'fan', 'favorite', 'characters', 'have', 'suddenly', 'disappeared', 'explanation', 'Also', 'corny', 'sense', 'humor', 'injected', 'try', 'disipate', 'tedium', 'many', 'Year', '1', 'stories', 'had', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'program', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'one', 'can', 'still', 'find', 'lot', 'escapist', 'fun', 'Irwin', 'Allen-type', 'Sci-Fi', 'explanations', 'production', 'design', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'still', 'top', 'notch', 'stories', 'have', 'more', 'action', 'style', 'tone', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'certainly', 'questionable', 'set', 'really', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Obviously', 'Metamorph', 'best', 'lot', 'introducing', 'Maya', 'molecular', 'tranforming', 'sexy', 'alien', 'Exiles', 'moments', 'Humanity', 'one', 'androids', 'story', 'actually', 'holdover', 'Year', '1', 'Glisters', 'critised', 'entire', 'cast', 'really', 'lot', 'fun', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'fom', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'thought', 'was', 'nadir', 'entire', 'series', 'Journey', 'Where', 'tolerable', 'Taybor', 'well', 'were', 'warned.Still', 'enjoyment', 'tolerance', 'Set', 'program', 'really', 'how', 'non-discriminating', 'are', 'cheesy', 'Sci-Fi', 'big', 'budget']","Space 1999, Set 5"

I have never seen a year two episode that wasnt worn out and scratchy, the pristine quality makes you  think your seeing these episodes for the first time. There are more bonuses than the previouse disks but still no ""making of"" documentary. A and E has again done a great job, making the wait worth it ...Lets hope A and E puts out more bonuses and the special ""MESSAGE"" episode!Season two begins with the addition of Maya, in the episode The Metamorph. After escaping her evil father she goes to live on Moonbase Alpha. Maya has the power of molecular transformation-she can change into any lifeform in the blink of an eye. Space 1999 was one of the first-maybe THE FIRST-television series to have a morphing character, and this was way before computer animation! Her changes were feats of camera work, who can forget her eye! The Exiles is about an alien Bonny and Clyde who hold Alpha hostage. Maya does a really cool midair transformation into a panther. One moment of humanity is about robots who want to learn to kill so they can eliminate their human masters. This episode sizzles with sex!  Tony and Helena are pitted against each other and end up almost killing each other. Journey to Where is about time travel going amok. This episode has much in common with many first season episodes and even ends on a grim philosophical note. The minatures of Earths' future cities are very well done and realistic. The Taybor  is about a trader who will stop at nothing to get Maya- and who can blame him!If you want the best of weird and cool sci-fi Space 1999 season two is it.",5,YEAR 2-BETTER THAN YEAR 1!!!!!!!,1014336000,"02 22, 2002",2002,1654,"['Season', 'two', 'Space', '1999', 'finaly', 'arrived', 'better', 'ever', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'year', 'two', 'episode', 'wasnt', 'worn', 'out', 'scratchy', 'pristine', 'quality', 'think', 'seeing', 'episodes', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'more', 'bonuses', 'previouse', 'disks', 'still', 'making', 'documentary', 'E', 'again', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'wait', 'hope', 'E', 'out', 'more', 'bonuses', 'special', 'MESSAGE', 'episode', 'Season', 'two', 'addition', 'Maya', 'episode', 'Metamorph', 'escaping', 'evil', 'father', 'live', 'Moonbase', 'Alpha', 'Maya', 'power', 'molecular', 'transformation-she', 'can', 'change', 'lifeform', 'blink', 'eye', 'Space', '1999', 'was', 'one', 'first-maybe', 'THE', 'FIRST-television', 'series', 'have', 'morphing', 'character', 'was', 'way', 'computer', 'animation', 'changes', 'were', 'feats', 'camera', 'work', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'eye', 'Exiles', 'alien', 'Bonny', 'Clyde', 'who', 'hold', 'Alpha', 'hostage', 'Maya', 'really', 'cool', 'midair', 'transformation', 'panther', 'One', 'moment', 'humanity', 'robots', 'who', 'want', 'learn', 'kill', 'can', 'eliminate', 'human', 'masters', 'episode', 'sex', 'Tony', 'Helena', 'are', 'pitted', 'other', 'end', 'up', 'almost', 'killing', 'other', 'Journey', 'Where', 'time', 'travel', 'going', 'amok', 'episode', 'much', 'common', 'many', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'even', 'grim', 'philosophical', 'note', 'minatures', 'Earths', 'future', 'cities', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'realistic', 'Taybor', 'trader', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'Maya-', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'want', 'best', 'weird', 'cool', 'sci-fi', 'Space', '1999', 'season', 'two']","Space 1999, Set 5"

It premiered in 1976, 30 years ago on a local station here in Arkansas, as the most expensive sci-fi series ever produced.  As a 19 year old, I missed very few episodes from the first season (working night shifts, I missed some).  Now, as a 49 year old, I have cried with joy as I watched the DVD episodes, some that I had never seen before!  This is mind-candy for me!!  Times were simpler then for me and for everyone.

When they went to the second season, Fred Frieberger took over - former of the original Star Trek production team.He wanted to make it &quot;hip&quot; for the 70's. But what he did is make it more unreal for me. He dropped my favorite set &quot;Main Mission&quot; and created &quot;Command Center&quot; a much smaller and more compact room to run the base of now 289 members. The Eagles got &quot;mufflers&quot; and &quot;spoilers&quot; and they dropped two of my favorite characters - Proffesor Victor Bergman (Barry Morse) and Paul Morrow (Prentis Hancock).Almost every epsiode someone dies. They would have never made it to a forth season because by the time third season was over, there would only be a 100 people left.The changes I did like were the Catherine Schell character of Miya. She orginally appeared as the Keeper in Gaurdian Of Piri in the first season and did so well the producers wanted her back as a regular. Tony Chelini (Tony Anolt) was an interesting character to add too.Visually this series relized on Laser Blasts every episode and a new set of monsters every week. Yikes! The production value of the monster made some of Dr. Who's villians look like real creatures.Overall the stories are not as good as well. But there are some interesting action moments and comedy. (The comedy was added with no real purpose - all of a sudden, every plays jokes!)The DVD has an interesting feature as well. Some of the original station specific promos with Barbara Bain and Martin Landau promoting the show. Very unique.

686070,A30Q8X8B1S3GGT,B00005UW77,"Mark Savary ""moon_city""","[7, 10]","Many producers could really learn a lesson or two from the end result of ""Space:1999"". Initially a deep, intellegent, metaphysical, and moody series, the second season of ""Space:1999"" was radically altered until the show became an action/kid's program that was almost a parody of itself. Fans have seen the same kind of heresy with ""seaQuest DSV"", and ""Galactica: 1980"", and it begs the question, ""Why go so far with re-tooling, when it just doesn't work?""In the case of ""Space:1999"", Gerry and Sylvia Anderson were in the middle of a very nasty divorce towards the end of Season 1, and Sylvia's hand would be sorely missing from the tiller of ""Space:1999"". No second season would ever have existed except that Gerry Anderson was able to get an American producer to speed up production, and make the episodes more marketable in the States. The new season would lean more heavily on Gerry's style of storytelling; less intellectual/metaphysical, more fast-paced action.I remember being a particularly disappointed youngster with Season 2 when it premiered. The music was all disco-funk. The uniforms were wrong. There was no Main Mission control center. Worst of all, no Victor, Paul, or Kano! Mathias inexplicably vanished, replaced by a series of Mathias lookalikes. Even Sandra got a new name and was pushed so far off into the background, whenever she appeared I wondered who she was! At least, I thought, the Eagle looks the same, and so did the exterior models of Alpha. Just about the only saving grace for the show, as far as I was concerned.As for Maya and Tony, they didn't do much for me. While at least Maya had some cool powers (though why she could turn into Earth animals without ever having seen them before was a mystery), Tony was just kind of aggravating. I thought, ""Hey, who is this guy? Where did HE come from? And where's Paul?!""Everything took on a cheap, slapdash feel. Characters acted very strange, and the new cast (other than Maya and Tony), ranged from dull to just plain annoying (remember that Irish/cowboy/geologist from ""All That Glisters""?). Science, which was always kind of sketchy on the show, went completely out the window in the new season.And don't even get me started on Koenig's pink/orange jacket!Still, I kept watching, mostly in the vain hope that the show would go back to the moody style of Year One, or that some of my favorite characters would appear again. No such luck. The new mood for the show was strangely... cheerful.Regardless of my venom, I have to admit that there is a soft spot in my heart for Season 2, just like there is for other shows I grew up with in the '70s. And there was that cool evil mirror-Koenig episode, and even the episode with the bad plants on the planet Luton, and still other installments, that were a mixture of action, effects, and sci-fi that was just right for kids. But Season 1 was always my preference, even back then.The hand of ""The Show Killer"" (a generally unfair title for Fred Freiberger), is evident in the ""Star Trek-ization"" of the second season. The ""Star Trek"" touches in Season 2 are the chief reason why ""Trek"" fans despise the series, whereas Season 1 was just too ""boring"" for them.Freiberger (who created the early '70s live action kid's show ""Korg"", and helmed the last season of the original ""Trek"", and ""Six Million Dollar Man""), brought his own ""action/humor"" style to the series, which clashed with the already established ""Space:1999"" universe.To Freiberger's enduring credit, he was a special guest speaker at the Breakaway convention in Los Angeles back in 1999. Although he may have feared being stoned with commlocks, he told it like it was, and said that if the fans did not like the changes in Season 2 (or on ""Trek"", etc.), he did the best he could, but ultimately he was the one to blame. Fans, he said, should not have to settle for something they did not like. So, although Freiberger has gotten a bad rap in sci-fi circles (and especially from ""Trek"" fans), I have to say that he was a real straight-shooter who did his best with what he had.I got a chance to ask him what was the one thing about the show he really liked when he first took over, and he said that without a doubt it was the eagle spacecraft. You can see this reflected in Season 2, with extensive eagle use throughout, a huge model of the eagle hanger (spectacularly blown up in a later episode), and new attachments and equipment for the workhorse of Alpha Moonbase.In any event, I could not resist buying at least the first two sets in the Season 2 release. I recommend other Season 1 snobs like myself to do the same. The sets are nicely packaged, and I couldn't see any problem with the transfers.And the episodes? To be honest, they aren't quite as bad as I remember. Although full of cheap and cheesy elements, tiny sets, happy endings, forced jokes, and the overall style I hated as a kid, as an adult I find that I can more appreciate the concepts presented in Season 2. Some of the story ideas had merit, even if the execution of those ideas did not. And Maya's mecheivous sense of humor, along with the Koenig/Helena banter, and even Tony's beermaking skills (or lack thereof), were interesting additions.While I do consider Season 1 to be the definitive ""Space:1999"", Season 2 is still fun for nostalgia's sake.",3,"""Re-tooling"" gone too far...",1014508800,"02 24, 2002",2002,5312,"['Many', 'producers', 'could', 'really', 'learn',

In an attempt to ""Americanize"" the series (which was already popular as a UK product), cast members are dropped, sets and costumes changed, music altered and stories pumped up. Where we gain action and emotion we lose the awe and terror of the unknown. Missing most of all is Barry Morse, who looked upon the moon's journey with a sense of utter fascination.However, Catherine Schell comes aboard as the shape-shifter Maya. The Metamorph character was an unnecessary addition, but Ms. Schell is welcome and a wonderful personality.After the first two episodes, there is a serious downslide in episode quality. The stories are dumbed down quite a bit, with macho posturing taking the place of desperation. I enjoy both seasons, but find season 1 to be much more sophisticated.There is much to recommend here, but be warned...it's an almost a different series. The episodes improve toward the end of the series, but some of the worst are in these two sets (Mark Of Archanon, One Moment Of Humanity & Catacombs of the Moon are all stinkers).Great effects, above par acting and a good musical score salvage some really pedestrian plots.
