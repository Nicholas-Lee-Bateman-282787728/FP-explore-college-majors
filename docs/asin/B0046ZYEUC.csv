There are funnier comedians than Kathleen Madigan who never use a curse word.

Davis,"[1, 1]","Lewis Black calls Kathleen Madigan his BFF and &#34;the funniest comic in America, bar none.&#34; Mr. Black may be less than objective; while Madigan is indeed funny, she is in fact nowhere near the funniest. This hour-long show, taped in 2009, takes the viewer through constantly changing topics which she navigates with relatively smooth transitions.After a brief initial bit about her imaginary illnesses, she performs a really funny routine on the USO tour of Afghanistan and Bosnia that she took with fellow comedian Black and singers Kid Rock and Kellie Pickler, who is apparently just as dumb as she seems in interviews. Madigan's best crack about Afghanistan is her response to friends who ask her how much money it will cost to fix that benighted nation: &#34;How much money would it cost to fix the moon?&#34;Quick, amusing riffs on Detroit, the National Guard, bickering parents, Hilary Clinton, and Barack Obama come to a crashing halt when Madigan does an unabashedly racist routine about the Chinese, complete with a poor imitation of an accent. Since she's from Missouri, though, I don't suppose I should be surprised (I said that in a St. Louis accent, which you can't hear, but trust me, it was hilarious).Madigan's use of accents, occasionally a strength, is at times a failing, as when she augments a bit on getting a sketchy home loan from WaMu with a supposedly Filipino accent that doesn't come within 5,000 miles of the Philippines. If you're going to mock other nationalities, you have to get this right or you come across as an ignorant bigot. Her liberal use of profanity and her choice of transient or outdated subjects like the Underwear Bomber don't bother me nearly as much as this casual racism.Fortunately, Madigan gets back on track with riotous routines about Catholics and Mormons, and with a funny solution to both health care costs and terrorism: &#34;Why not, at the airport, send everyone through a CAT scan?&#34; She riffs on banks and Oprah Winfrey, her passion for Taco Bell, and her contempt for Sarah Palin and Tea Party women who claim they want what the Founding Fathers wanted: &#34;Well, ladies, they didn't want to let us vote, so you might want to reread the brochure of the team you just signed up with.&#34;After cycling through old news like Paula Abdul, Katie Couric, Michael Jackson, Tiger Woods, and Suze Orman, Madigan gets to her strongest material: her Irish-American family, and especially her father, a cynical lawyer who is clearly one of the primary sources of her mordant worldview. She cracks wise about where her parents live - the Ozarks - and about computers, which her folks are always finding new ways to break.Madigan wraps up with a variety of very witty bits on vegetarians in Los Angeles (who tell her God didn't mean for us to eat cows, to which she responds, &#34;Then I think he shoulda made `em harder to catch. You don't see anybody eating cheetah burgers, do ya?&#34;), elderly women in Las Vegas (for which she produces some hilarious voices), Indian casinos in Minnesota (where she indulges in her favorite vices: gambling, drinking, and smoking), and gay marriage (but she really wants to see someone marry a goat).I enjoyed this program despite its flaws, but it really doesn't rival the very best of stand-up comedy.",3,Lewis Black's Wisecracking Buddy,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,3301,"['Lewis', 'Black', 'Kathleen', 'Madigan', 'BFF', '34', 'funniest', 'comic', 'America', 'bar', 'none.', '34', 'Mr.', 'Black', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'objective', 'Madigan', 'indeed', 'funny', 'fact', 'nowhere', 'funniest', 'hour-long', 'show', 'taped', '2009', 'viewer', 'constantly', 'changing', 'topics', 'relatively', 'smooth', 'transitions.After', 'brief', 'initial', 'bit', 'imaginary', 'illnesses', 'really', 'funny', 'routine', 'USO', 'tour', 'Afghanistan', 'Bosnia', 'took', 'fellow', 'comedian', 'Black', 'singers', 'Kid', 'Rock', 'Kellie', 'Pickler', 'who', 'apparently', 'just', 'as', 'dumb', 'interviews', 'Madigan', 'best', 'crack', 'Afghanistan', 'response', 'friends', 'who', 'ask', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'will', 'cost', 'fix', 'benighted', 'nation', '34', 'How', 'much', 'money', 'would', 'cost', 'fix', 'moon', '34', 'Quick', 'amusing', 'riffs', 'Detroit', 'National', 'Guard', 'bickering', 'parents', 'Hilary', 'Clinton', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'come', 'crashing', 'halt', 'when', 'Madigan', 'unabashedly', 'racist', 'routine', 'Chinese', 'complete', 'poor', 'imitation', 'accent', 'Missouri', 'do', ""n't"", 'suppose', 'should', 'be', 'surprised', 'said', 'St.', 'Louis', 'accent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'was', 'hilarious', '.Madigan', 'use', 'accents', 'occasionally', 'strength', 'times', 'failing', 'when', 'bit', 'getting', 'sketchy', 'home', 'loan', 'WaMu', 'supposedly', 'Filipino', 'accent', ""n't"", 'come', '5,000', 'miles', 'Philippines', ""'re"", 'going', 'mock', 'other', 'nationalities', 'have', 'get', 'right', 'come', 'ignorant', 'bigot', 'liberal', 'use', 'profanity', 'choice', 'transient', 'outdated', 'subjects', 'Underwear', 'Bomber', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'casual', 'racism.Fortunately', 'Madigan', 'back', 'track', 'riotous', 'routines', 'Catholics', 'Mormons', 'funny', 'solution', 'health', 'care', 'costs', 'terrorism', '34', 'Why', 'not', 'airport', 'send', 'everyone', 'CAT', 'scan', '34', 'banks', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'passion', 'Taco', 'Bell', 'contempt', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'Tea', 'Party', 'women', 'who', 'claim', 'want', 'what', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'wanted', '34', 'Well', 'ladies', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'let', 'vote', 'might', 'want', 'reread', 'brochure', 'team', 'just', 'signed', 'up', 'with.', '34', 'cycling', 'old', 'news', 'Paula', 'Abdul', 'Katie', 'Couric', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Tiger', 'Woods', 'Suze', 'Orman', 'Madigan', 'strongest', 'material', 'Irish-American', 'family', 'especially', 'father', 'cynical', 'lawyer', 'who', 'clearly', 'one', 'primary', 'sources', 'mordant', 'worldview', 'wise', 'where', 'parents', 'live', 'Ozarks', 'computers', 'folks', 'are', 'always', 'finding', 'new', 'ways', 'break.Madigan', 'wraps', 'up', 'variety', 'very', 'witty', 'bits', 'vegetarians', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'who', 'tell', 'God', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'eat', 'cows', '34', 'Then', 'think', 'made', 'em', 'harder', 'catch', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anybody', 'eating', 'cheetah', 'burgers', 'do', 'ya', '34', 'elderly', 'women', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'hilarious', 'voices', 'Indian', 'casinos', 'Minnesota', 'where', 'favorite', 'vices', 'gambling', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'gay', 'marriage', 'really', 'see', 'someone', 'marry', 'goat', 'enjoyed', 'program', 'flaws', 'really', ""n't"", 'rival', 'very', 'best', 'stand-up', 'comedy']",N/A
