The problems lies with the unfortunate ubiquitous ""humanizing"" of heroes - a common problem for all SF/fantasy/horros TV series. The writers start introducing more emotions, more love lines, more siblings problems and suffering and move from ""the city and the monsters"" show (which is interesting) into the ""sex, city and a bit of monsters - when we have time for them"". The overly rich emotional life of the heroes just bores to death. As much as I loved the first season, I am not sure even if I want to watch the ""children of earth"" - if it continues in the same direction.

1142387,A2VMT89TCSF105,B0013GS3WW,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[0, 4]","""Torchwood"" is a British science fiction series and a spin off to the unnaturally popular ""Doctor Who"". Indeed, the name Torchwood is actually an anagram of Doctor Who.""Doctor Who"" is a very quaint series, often bordering the intentionally ridiculous, and although styled as a family show, it's probably best suited for kids around 13 years of age. The main character, the Doctor, is a immortal, shape shifting space alien who battles evil robots and mad scientists, while roaming the universe in a time machine disguised as a phone boot (!).""Torchwood"", by contrast, was marketed as a more adult series. It does contain more sex, violence and general mayhem, and the characters all seem to suffer from constant neuroses. To all intents and purposes, however, it's really a kind of ""Doctor Who for adults"". The evil aliens may be more violent, but they are just as comical (or involuntarily comical) as the aliens in ""Doctor Who"". Don't miss the fat lady dressed in green who turns out to be a monster with strange breeding habits. Or the monster insects from outer space who can cure AIDS. Or the Weevils, a bunch of bizarre aliens who for reasons unknown live in the...wait for it...sewers of Cardiff. Why not move to a public housing estate?The human characters, with their strange depressions, also come across as a bunch of funny weirdos. I mean, one of them runs around half of season two in mint zombie condition. The leader of the Torchwood team, Captain Jack, is an immortal bisexual. His gay boyfriend has the usual penchant for fashionwear. And then there's Tosh, a Japanese computer geek madly and sadly in love with the zombie.Well, at least they have diversity on this show!The first time a saw ""Torchwood"", I considered it really bad.

When BBC-America began running Torchwood about 2 years ago, I was hooked after the first episode.Of course, it didn't hurt that I was already familiar with the central character, Capt. Jack Harkness, from his appearances on Dr. Who, another BBC series that had wormed its way into my heart.  And it didn't hurt that John Barrowman, scores a 9-1/2 on the handsome scale, or that his character is able to hold his sense of humor in the fact of death and destruction.  However, the most important part of the first episode is that all of the characters were fully formed and ready to interact with themselves and their world.The characters are fascinating; Gwen is the heart of the cast, an ex?-police officer with a sensitivity to both humans and monsters that they meat, whereas Owen, the doctor, is the opposite rude, callous, and unable to form a lasting relationship with anyone.  Toshiko (""Tosh"") is a shy genius with an amazing touch with computers, hacking in wherever she needs to find what she needs.  Finally, there's Ianto, with, as Jack once says, his ""beautiful Welsh vowels,"" another shy man who started off as the ""receptionist"" and liaison with the outside world.  Finally, there's Cardiff, a city with a personality like no one has ever seen before -- Strongly Welsh with a modern overlay.Watch a couple episodes.

They changed the line from them needing t be ready for the big event hitting in the 21st century to being prepared.  Interesting given they never said what it was.  Now with Captain Jack hitting everyone on the show or at least wanting to we get introduced to some of his past and the person he stole his identity from who ironically has the hots for him.With Season 2 we at least have science fiction and some better alignment of the story and the baseline for the story.  The show is a bit more consistent and the stories tie together better.  This is the season where the show earns it the 4 star rating as while there are still many deviations, it is science fiction and should have surprises in the technology or it would lose that portion of the show that drew science fiction fans to watch in the first place.I personally dislike the inclusion of our captain's promiscuity with the men and woman as it distracts from the story and doesn't add to the character.  It is fine to include the personal life aspects of the characters in a series, but these are purposeless tangents in the story to add sex to the show at a level that feels forced.  They are already a group of isolated &#34;nerds&#34; who just so happen to be exceptionally good looking at the same time (just like real life?), could write consistently to include these details or not but instead it is sporadic and pointless to the stories.The show continues to be an oddball show that given its writing flaws continues to provide the entertainment so lacking in most shows and thus keeps fans interested.  Just have to be ready to have things turn on a dime at any moment in any show which is part of the interest but also part of the lack of any real pace to the show and sense that there is a progression of a story line being told.  It continues to just be radical shifts in the story and revelations that don't reconcile to anything that has been building, just more information to add to the stockpile of wherever this show is heading.I continue to enjoy watching in spite of the lack of sense of a story being told because there is enough energy and interesting developments that it is entertaining, even if not assembled into anything that resembles an ongoing story being told.  The change in the tone and cadence is just part of makes Torchwood unique.  I'll reserve whether that is good or bad until I get to the end.  For now it is just different and taking getting used to.  I have more negative to say than positive, but it does continue to be entertaining so I keep watching and liking it even when I find it frustrating and left with a sense that it could turn into something I don't like at any time within 2 shows.

Did some people object I wonder?  It used to be,  ""Torchwood.  Outside the government, beyond the police. Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future. The 21st century is when everything changes. And you got to be ready.""This season Russell Davies and Co have gotten rid of the arming humans part.  A gesture towards pacifism?  ""Torchwood.  Outside the government, beyond the police. Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race. The 21st century is when everything changes. And Torchwood is ready.""  See, they've even changed the last few words.  When before it was ""You've got to be ready,"" now we find out that we needn't bother taking arms against the alien invaders, since Torchwood has it covered.And yet, as other reviewers have noticed, Torchwood ain't ready for nothin!  If I was a drinking man, I would play my own game, every time Captain Jack's eyes well up with close-up tears, I'd have a shot of some Welsh liquor, and I'd still be drunk.  Everyone's emotional, which is cool I guess, but sometimes it all gets a bit much, especially given that all five leads are grieving for a love that's lost to them now by death or other malfeasance, so their energies seem often lost in the past, like the heroes of Marcel Proust, so that aliens slip by them like nuns past the blind man.  In this season Gwen and Rhys finally get married, and even better Rhys is let into the secrets of Torchwood, and that is fortunate, sicne the Famous 5 start to get out of their self-absorbed melancholia and start seeing things as Rhys sees them--how preposterous they are.In a way, I liked the shock ending, but in another way, it makes me feel like the next season probably won't be that good.  But I've been wrong before and I hope that ""Children of Earth"" proves me wrong.  By the way, does any other TW fan feel that Jack's little brother, Gray, is possibly the worst actor ever given a apeaking part in the history of TV?

There are bold ideas and events that are somewhat subtle in their presentation; you have to think about what is being said to get the full impact.  It is quirky and quite different from most TV shows, and a nice change from the usual USA shows.  There are a few writers for the show, and they make no attempt to make the show seem like it has one writer, judging by the variety of styles - even from the same writer.James Marsters makes an important appearance in the series, being part of the overarching story line for the entire season, which mainly affects the beginning and the end.  I really enjoyed him in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, as Spike.  And again as Spike in Angel, a Buffy spin-off.  In this series, his name is John, but he mostly plays it like Spike anyway, and I wondered at first if he could be anyone else.  But we see new sides to his character eventually, and in Caprica 1.0 and 1.5, he shows up yet again, looking a little older and chubbier, but much darker, and without all the smirky stuff.  As it happens, we have been watching Caprica, Torchwood 2 and the final season of Angel during the same months, and it really seemed like he was always going to be present.In Season 1 episode 1, we are introduced to the Torchwood team, though not their background, with the exception of Gwen, who at that time is a police officer.  We learn how it is that she comes to be part of the team, and see how she changes.  Near the end of Season 2, there is an episode that does a nice job introducing three other characters, how Jack met them, and how they changed on joining the team.  Jack remains a bit of an enigma, though there are enough bits tossed out to get the general idea of his unusual background.  The storyline involving James Masters gives us more important information.We often watch the show with English subtitles.  Part of it is the rather thick Welsh-English accent employed by some characters, part of it is to study the interesting turns of phrase in their local vernacular.It's hard to discuss this series much more without getting into spoilers.  I'll just comment that I like it when shows are willing to portray events that force the show to change dramatically, and this one does that: it sets the scene for change in Children of Earth, a.k.a. Season 3.  I'm looking forward to it!Why four stars?  This is a very good and entertaining show, but I reserve five stars for my all-time favorites, and there are better shows than this out there.

1142502,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0013GS3WW,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[3, 3]","In my review for thefirst season of TorchwoodI concluded that the show had plenty of potential in regards to its setup, actors and production values, but which was obviously struggling to find its feet. A reliance on shock value, some sloppy scripts, and the inclusion of several unlikable main characters weakened the final product, though not so much that I wasn't intrigued by the possibility of these mistakes being rectified in the following season.And for the most part, they are. Season two is aware of its past faults and makes an effort to fix them. The stories are less predictable and manage to be more fun and more serious at the same time. Characters are better developed, and the annoying qualities of Gwen and Owen have been toned down (though not eradicated). And rather than relying on singular episodes there is more of an overarching plot at work that allows for more depth in the storytelling.A spin-off ofDoctor Whothat purports to be more ""adult"", Torchwood is the name of a not-so-secret organization that deals with the aliens, time-travelers and other anomalies that emerge through the Rift in space and time that it situated right over the city of Cardiff, Wales. The team is lead by the charming, enigmatic and impossible-to-kill Captain Jack Harkness, and made up of policewoman Gwen Cooper, computer-technician Toshiko Sato, medical doctor Owen Harper and faithful butler Ianto Jones. Making a pseudo-family of sorts, the colleges deal with the strange occurrences that threaten the city and its inhabitants.And of strange occurrences there are many, including a familiar face from Jack's past out to cause trouble, alien sleepers planning an invasion, a cryogenically frozen soldier from the first world war, an alien that can seamlessly integrate himself into memories, a stranded alien whale, shape-shifters, creepy side-show performers that emerge from old film reels, and a range of civilian disappearances.  For the most part the stories are well written and convincingly acted, and although some are certainly better than others, none of them are unwatchable.But it's the human element that makes the second season an improvement on its predecessor. Every character is given more depth and background, and the actors seem a lot more settled in their roles. Gwen is far more useful and her much-vaunted empathy is actually shown rather than just harped on. Owen is still abrasive and arrogant, but at least his repugnant qualities have been significantly lessoned. The writers choose to deal with Owen and Gwen's affair by completely ignoring it (a little strange, but neither characters' finest moment, and so probably for the best). Tosh and Ianto are given more screen-time, and stories of their own.Most of all, we learn more about the mysterious Captain Jack, first introduced in Doctor Who as a con-artist from the 51st century. There are plenty of insights into his life, including his childhood in the distant future, the loss of his little brother Grey, his time-traveling back into the Victorian era and his initial recruitment into Torchwood at the hands of some rather sassy 19th century ladies. The more we know, the more intriguing he becomes. In an extended flashback episode, we also learn how the three original members of Jack's team were brought together as a team, whether it was frightening, tragic or humorous. Midway through the series, one of the team-members goes through a (literally) life-changing experience, which changes our entire preconceptions of this character and how he operates within the group - and in fact, life itself.There's also a plethora of guest stars that add color and interest to the usual routine. Fans ofBuffy the Vampire Slayerwill instantly recognize James Marsters as Captain John Hart, a fellow time agent and a foil to our Jack, whose true feelings and motivations are left slightly murky throughout his appearances. Martha Jones fromDoctor Whostops by, significantly more grown-up and professional as a UNIT member and qualified doctor who lends her services to the team for a three-episode arc. And I have a soft-spot for Rhys, Gwen's befuddled fianc&eacute; who finally finds out the truth about his partner's job and reacts in quite a touching way. In many ways Rhys exemplifies the ""everyman"" far more than Gwen does, and when he steps up to the plate (with a chainsaw, no less), it's worth a round of applause.Altogether, I definitely enjoyed this season more than the last, though it continues to irritate me that the Torchwood team always seems to come across as a group of very smart people doing very stupid things. Despite Jack's opening narrative: ""Torchwood is ready,"" nothing could be further from the truth. This is not a team of professionals, but a few individuals recruited as much for their dysfunctional natures as their skills. Whether this makes them all the more endearing or just plain irritating usually depends on the context of the story they're in and the quality of the episode. As always, the DVD is packed full of supplementary material, including outtakes, deleted scenes, a featurette on Jack, and an in-depth look at all the episodes.Next up isTorchwood: Children of Earth.

1142509,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B0013GS3WW,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[107, 123]","It's yet another season of ""Torchwood"", a ""Doctor Who"" for adults.  Now in its 2nd season, we meet a team of professionals who battle aliens and try to protect us from all sorts of cosmic anomalies.  Based in Cardiff - centrally located on a rift in time and space - ""Torchwood"" stands ready to do the job.  With plenty of foul language and sexual...um...stuff, you never forget the seriousness of the situation, or the fact that the end of the world never means having to forego a good ""snog"".""Torchwood"" remains a pretty controversial show.  Everything that made the 1st season both fun and frustrating are ramped up in S2.But first, the ep.s themselves.""Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang""  (I wonder how many British shows have come and gone wishing to use that title.)  Remember how S1 built up the anticipation to that same sex kiss in ""Captain Jack Harkness""?  Well, subtlety goes out the window in the first few minutes of the season opener, returning Jack from his adventure in the ""Doctor Who"" season 2 finale.  Here, Jack introduces the team to his thrill-kill former colleague and not-so-former lover, Time-Agent Captain Jon Hart.  What is Hart's agenda?  And how much lip-lock will the team be forced to watch before Jack takes any action?""Sleeper"", an obvious idea nevertheless not given the treatment until now.  The team must confront deep-cover terrorist insurgents from another planet.  They look like ordinary people - husbands, wives, lovers, parents - but when the signal starts, they become indestructible agents of mass destruction.""To the Last Man"", a pretty good episode in which the team finds a breakdown in time barriers between the present and WWI era threaten the space-time continuum.  Only an inhabitant of that period, sent back to his time from our own, can save the universe.  Luckily, Torchwood has kept a WWI soldier on ice since 1918 for just such an occasion.  TV shows (especially cop shows) are typically weak because they marginalize guest stars, but this ep. shows how Torchwood excels in integrating guest characters into its larger mythos.""Meat"".  An episode that gives the vegans a chance (among many) to laugh at us carnivores.  The team investigates a meatpacking operation profiting on the flesh of apparently alien source.  The story itself is pretty thin, but as with many eps. the saving grace is the character interaction - chiefly involving Rhys, Gwen's annoying fianc&eacute;e.""Adam"".  Who's Adam?  Nobody seems to think that Adam has been anything but a longtime and loyal teammate, so nobody seems to realize that he just insinuated himself into the group and their memories.  At first helpful, the script reveals how darkly dangerous a man with memory-altering powers can be.  A great episode that reveals more background on Capt. Jack and also informs how much they care about each other.""Reset"" what would sci-fi be without a dig at the medical establishment?  This was actually a weak story punctuated by a great appearance from Alan Dale (known in the US for ""Lost"" and ""Ugly Betty""), the debut in Torchwood of ""Doctor Who"" vet Martha Jones (which provides for much cheerily licentious dialog) and a thoroughly heartbreaking ending.""Dead Man Walking"" picks up where ""Reset"" left off.  The facts of the story substantially nullifies the tragedy that ended ""Reset"" without damaging the other episode's dramatic payoff.  (Can't say anything else w/o a substantial spoiler.)  The episode is the midway to the conclusive ""A Day in the Death"".  Again, spoilfree review guidelines prevent more specific description.  Suffice it to say that this ep. is ""Random Shoes"" of the season, only better than that ep.""Something Borrowed"" has Gwen and Rhys finally tying the knot.  Only, a late night duel-to-the-death with a shape-shifting alien carnivore leaves Gwen in a compromising position that threatens to ruin the wedding.  Funny, scary and still very adult, this is easily one of the show's more entertaining eps.""From Out of the Rain"" has Cardiff menaced by ""Night Travelers"", performers of a ghostly circus that steals the breath of ordinary human beings.  A decidedly creepy ep. with a disappointing payoff.""Adrift"" a horrible story.  Gwen follows up on a large volume of missing-person cases possibly tied to The Rift.  In bonding to many civilians in search of missing loved ones, Gwen's makes some pretty obvious and painful errors in judgment.  Anybody who thought last season's episodes ""Small Worlds"" and ""Out of Time"" were pointless will probably feel the same way about ""Adrift"".""Fragments"" a great episode in which a crisis situation forces each of our heroes to separately delve into their past and recall how they joined Torchwood.  Best part of the episode: Jack meets Torchwood's saucy Victorian era operatives.  This ep. sets the stage for the season finale -""Exit Wounds"".  It's very difficult to discuss the finale w/o spoilers.  Let's just say that it involves Captain Jon and Jack's lost brother, Gray, and basically ends with final heartbreak for the team.  Unfortunately, it also follows too closely the 3rd season finale of Doctor Who, with the emotional confrontation between hero and villain.WHAT'S WRONG W/TORCHWOOD?Torchwood never fully becomes the adult version of Doctor Who.  Too many ideas are developed without a payoff (the ""Night Travellers"" being an obvious example; the show eerily introduces them, then quickly discards them); also, the show falls into the trap of so quickly assuming its maturity based on sexual content & bad language, that it sometimes leaves fatally obvious signs of its lineage to ""that other show"", itself originally a kid's show.  It takes more than a profusion of potty language and a healthy diet of ""snogging"", to elevate ""Torchwood"" to maturity - think of kids playing ""dress-up"" and you get the idea.  The other flaw is in the premise, but it's a somewhat complicated flaw.  Watching the show, it's hard to get past the idea that ""Torchwood"" is often more in need of help than capable of providing.  Their position often makes them vulnerable to otherworldly threats - despite Captain Jack's weekly refrain, ""Torchwood"" is NOT ready.WHAT IS IRRESISTIBLEBut that premise actually the show's saving grace - the vulnerability of Jack, Ianto, Owen, Tosh and (especially) Gwen is the biggest reason for the show's appeal.  The script works in well just how close these guys get to getting offed on a weekly basis, trading witty and well-timed banter even as half the cosmos wants them dead.For the sake of the Cosmos, our lawyers insist on the following disclaimer: absolutely no DVD extras were viewed in the writing of this review (sheesh - we know we're controversial, but 20 unhelpful votes!?)",4,"For its flaws, still

1142511,AJ7SBFCIXPJM1,B0013GS3WW,"Scot Merideth Peirson ""Scot Peirson""","[1, 2]","When one takes into account what Russell T. Davies has done with his iteration of the Whoniverse, it becomes apparent that he has created--to this point--a triangle between ""Doctor Who"", ""The Sarah Jane Adventures"", and ""Torchwood"" with The Doctor being the apex/midpoint between the other two.  ""Sarah Jane""--because its home is BBC Kids--seems a little more buoyant, obviously aiming for its younger audience.  ""Torchwood"" is the punch in the mouth--it isn't pretty, it isn't nice, and sometimes the good guys don't get total victories.This is part of the theme of Series 2--and if one gets antsy with ""unclean wins"", so be it.  As I said about Series 1, Torchwood is a dark, somewhat cracked reflection of Doctor Who.  It isn't hard to see John Barrowman's Jack Harkness as what The Doctor would be if all his flaws were brought to the fore and his desires laid public.  Nor is it hard to not see that Eve Myles' Gwen Cooper as a Companion with a few more skills...and complications to her life and to Captain Jack's.  The ways that Burn Gorman, Nakano Mori and Gareth Lloyd-Davies fill out the team compliment the lead taken by Barrowman and Myles, as well as the flaws they exhibit.  Barrowman has a pulse on the nature of Jack--who is far more of a serious sort than when he was introduced--and Myles brings a wonderful energy and depth to Gwen, attempting to balance her life with Torchwood Three with her impending nuptials with Rhys Williams; to say nothing of what happens when Rhys (Wonderfully played with the element of Archie Bunker as a jealous lover by Kai Owen) finds out what Gwen has been doing with her nights.Still, this season is a complicated story, and the story starts when James Marsters shows up in the opening episode, ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"".  There seems to be an unspoken rule with science fiction on both sides of the Atlantic--if you need a slightly over-the-top, trash-talking gray area character then find The Artist Formerly Known as Spike.  Marsters wonderfully embodies Captain John Hart, Jack's former partner (and lover) in the Time Agency; and his appearance sets in motion much of the twists and turns of the season.  So does Freema Agyeman's three-episode visit in the middle of this set as Martha Jones, during which the first severe turn occurs within Torchwood Three with Owen Harper's murder and regeneration, how the team adjusts to an already grumpy medical specialist who suddenly cannot enjoy eating, sleeping, or boinking.  I always felt that they never gave enough time in the series to Mori, who brought a considerable warmth and longing to Toshiko Sato, ultimately not fulfilled.  Her turn in ""To The Last Man"" was a wonderful and sad performance, and really came to embody the heartache in Tosh's life.  There is really not much done with Ianto through the second series--save the explanation of how he came to Torchwood Three in ""Fragments""--but it seems as if much of who he is is saved for ""Children Of Earth""...and the one scene with Barrowman and Myles that left me more than a little squeamish...Still, through the drama and pain--""To The Last Man"" and ""Adam"" embody much of the angst that goes unspoken between the members--to the action and slightly humorous moments of ""Something Borrowed""...the sense of something going horribly wrong is there, and gets fulfilled in ""Fragments"" and ""Exit Wounds"".  These two episodes, combined with the ""Children Of Earth"" miniseries, led many to suspect that Torchwood wouldn't be returning in 2010 when Series 5 of Doctor Who started...but that doesn't seem to be the case.This set is a tough, hard series of episodes; a crime drama that is more visceral and gritty than the series it was born from.  It's supposed to be that way.  It can be a little over-the-top--but so, very much so, is the series that it was drawn from.  And taken as what it is--the dark side of The Doctor's Universe--it fits the bill.  I consider this set to be highly enjoyable, and I recommend it because Torchwood--as an anthology--is a very good work in progress, with room to get better.",4,Torchwood Series 2--Brooding...,1261526400,"12 23, 2009",2009,4067,"['When', 'one', 'account', 'what', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'done', 'iteration', 'Whoniverse', 'apparent', 'created', 'point', 'triangle', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'Adventures', 'Torchwood', 'Doctor', 'being', 'apex/midpoint', 'other', 'two', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'home', 'BBC', 'Kids', 'little', 'more', 'buoyant', 'obviously', 'aiming', 'younger', 'audience', 'Torchwood', 'punch', 'mouth', ""n't"", 'pretty', ""n't"", 'nice', 'sometimes', 'good', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'total', 'victories.This', 'part', 'theme', 'Series', '2', 'one', 'unclean', 'wins', 'so', 'be', 'said', 'Series', '1', 'Torchwood', 'dark', 'somewhat', 'cracked', 'reflection', 'Doctor', 'Who', ""n't"", 'hard', 'see', 'John', 'Barrowman', 'Jack', 'Harkness', 'what', 'Doctor', 'would', 'be', 'flaws', 'were', 'brought', 'fore', 'desires', 'laid', 'public', 'hard', 'not', 'see', 'Eve', 'Myles', 'Gwen', 'Cooper', 'Companion', 'few', 'more', 'skills', 'complications', 'life', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'ways', 'Burn', 'Gorman', 'Nakano', 'Mori', 'Gareth', 'Lloyd-Davies', 'fill', 'out', 'team', 'compliment', 'lead', 'taken', 'Barrowman', 'Myles', 'as', 'well', 'flaws', 'exhibit', 'Barrowman', 'pulse', 'nature', 'Jack', 'who', 'far', 'more', 'serious', 'sort', 'when', 'was', 'introduced', 'Myles', 'wonderful', 'energy', 'depth', 'Gwen', 'attempting', 'balance', 'life', 'Torchwood', 'Three', 'impending', 'nuptials', 'Rhys', 'Williams', 'say', 'nothing', 'what', 'when', 'Rhys', 'Wonderfully', 'played', 'element', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'jealous', 'lover', 'Kai', 'Owen', 'out', 'what', 'Gwen', 'been', 'doing', 'nights.Still', 'season', 'complicated', 'story', 'story', 'when', 'James', 'Marsters', 'up', 'opening', 'episode', 'Kiss', 'Kiss', 'Bang', 'Bang', 'be', 'unspoken', 'rule', 'science', 'fiction', 'sides', 'Atlantic', 'need', 'slightly', 'over-the-top', 'trash-talking', 'gray', 'area', 'character', 'then', 'find', 'Artist', 'Formerly', 'Known', 'Spike', 'Marsters', 'wonderfully', 'Captain', 'John', 'Hart', 'Jack', 'former', 'partner', 'lover', 'Time', 'Agency', 'appearance', 'sets', 'motion', 'much', 'twists', 'turns', 'season', 'So', 'Freema', 'Agyeman', 'three-episode', 'visit', 'middle', 'set', 'Martha', 'Jones', 'first', 'severe', 'turn', 'Torchwood', 'Three', 'Owen', 'Harper', 'murder', 'regeneration', 'how', 'team', 'already', 'grumpy', 'medical', 'specialist', 'who', 'suddenly', 'can', 'not', 'enjoy', 'eating', 'sleeping', 'boinking', 'always', 'felt', 'never', 'gave', 'enough', 'time', 'series', 'Mori', 'who', 'brought', 'considerable', 'warmth', 'longing', 'Toshiko', 'Sato', 'ultimately', 'not', 'fulfilled', 'turn', 'Last', 'Man', 'was', 'wonderful', 'sad', 'performance', 'really', 'came', 'embody', 'heartache', 'Tosh', 'life', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'done', 'Ianto', 'second', 'series', 'save', 'explanation', 'how', 'came', 'Torchwood', 'Three', 'Fragments', 'much', 'who', 'saved', 'Children', 'Earth', 'one', 'scene', 'Barrowman', 'Myles', 'left', 'more', 'little', 'squeamish', 'Still', 'drama', 'pain', 'Last', 'Man', 'Adam', 'embody', 'much', 'angst', 'unspoken', 'members', 'action', 'slightly', 'humorous', 'moments', 'Something', 'Borrowed', 'sense', 'something', 'going', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'there', 'fulfilled', 'Fragments', 'Exit', 'Wounds', 'two', 'episodes', 'combined', 'Children', 'Earth', 'miniseries', 'led', 'many', 'suspect', 'Torchwood', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'returning', '2010', 'when', 'Series', '5', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'started', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'case.This', 'set', 'tough', 'hard', 'series', 'episodes', 'crime', 'drama', 'more', 'visceral', 'gritty', 'series', 'was', 'born', 'supposed', 'be', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'over-the-top', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'series', 'was', 'drawn', 'taken', 'what', 'dark', 'side', 'Doctor', 'Universe', 'bill', 'consider', 'set', 'be', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'recommend', 'Torchwood', 'anthology', 'very', 'good', 'work', 'progress', 'room', 'get', 'better']",Torchwood: Season 2

That would be this Season. But don't let yourself get hooked! Season two takes a horrible turn for the worse.In season 2 it seams the writers are trying to make sure every character ""bats for both teams"" and everyone sleeps with just about everyone.I'm not a homo-phobe: there are questions about my dad who still rooms with the same guy he left my mom for. My husband has a cousin everyone wishes would come out. It is part of our world today.But this show makes it seem like it is natural for everyone to change their minds. Take the butler like guy. In the first season he is pining over his girlfriend that he's hidden in the basement. She's half robot.Season II:He and the Captain become lovers.It was my understanding that either you are or you aren't. You don't just wake up one day and decide to swap teams.Add to this that the main character, the girl - I'm really bad with names - who is shacking up with her boyfriend. She decides to have a romance with one of the guys in Torchwood. It seems every other episode is about who's doing who.If that is what I wanted to see I'd watch Soaps.",1,Nothing but a Science Fiction Soap,1242777600,"05 20, 2009",2009,1248,"['loved', 'Who', 'have', 'watched', 'spin-offs', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'Adventures.At', 'first', 'Torchwood', 'was', 'original', 'intriguing', 'good', 'group', 'actors', 'would', 'be', 'Season', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'hooked', 'Season', 'two', 'horrible', 'turn', 'worse.In', 'season', '2', 'seams', 'writers', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'sure', 'character', 'bats', 'teams', 'everyone', 'sleeps', 'just', 'everyone.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'homo-phobe', 'are', 'questions', 'dad', 'who', 'still', 'rooms', 'same', 'guy', 'left', 'mom', 'husband', 'cousin', 'everyone', 'wishes', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'part', 'world', 'today.But', 'show', 'natural', 'everyone', 'change', 'minds', 'Take', 'butler', 'guy', 'first', 'season', 'pining', 'girlfriend', 'hidden', 'basement', 'half', 'robot.Season', 'II', 'Captain', 'become', 'lovers.It', 'was', 'understanding', 'are', 'are', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'wake', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'decide', 'swap', 'teams.Add', 'main', 'character', 'girl', ""'m"", 'really', 'bad', 'names', 'who', 'shacking', 'up', 'boyfriend', 'have', 'romance', 'one', 'guys', 'Torchwood', 'other', 'episode', 'who', 'doing', 'who.If', 'what', 'wanted', 'see', ""'d"", 'watch', 'Soaps']",Torchwood: Season 2

I am very glad that I own both season one and two.  I can't wait for season three.John Barrowman who plays Captain Jack is magnetic.  Talk about charisma!  No wonder the others follow him even though they know very little about him.  For me Torchwood first and second seasons have been about knowing more about Captain Jack.Dr. Who has never interested me that much.  Sometimes I watch some of the new Dr. Who on PBS.  I can take Dr. Who or leave it though the new Dr. Who is an interesting character too.I am mesmerized by Captain Jack though.  He is the man all men want to be with -- straight or gay.  His sexuality (actually it seems that for him, a non-human, human categories of sexual preference are silly and irrelevant) never seems to be an issue.  He can seduce anyone.",5,Can't wait for Season 3,1232668800,"01 23, 2009",2009,872,"['do', ""n't"", 'get', 'BBC', 'TV', 'so', 'had', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Torchwood', 'was', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'own', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', 'three.John', 'Barrowman', 'who', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'magnetic', 'Talk', 'charisma', 'wonder', 'others', 'follow', 'even', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'Torchwood', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'knowing', 'more', 'Captain', 'Jack.Dr', 'Who', 'never', 'interested', 'much', 'Sometimes', 'watch', 'new', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'PBS', 'can', 'take', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'leave', 'new', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'interesting', 'character', 'too.I', 'am', 'mesmerized', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'man', 'men', 'want', 'be', 'straight', 'gay', 'sexuality', 'actually', 'non-human', 'human', 'categories', 'sexual', 'preference', 'are', 'silly', 'irrelevant', 'never', 'be', 'issue', 'can', 'seduce', 'anyone']",Torchwood: Season 2
