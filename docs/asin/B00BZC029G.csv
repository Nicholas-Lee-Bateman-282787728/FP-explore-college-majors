Things start out innocent and everyone is overjoyed at this discovery, but soon things become complicated as past, present, and future are changed and become entangled in different timelines.Steins;Gate shows the effect that change in an individual's life can have on the world as a whole. We often think of time travel and wish we could change things we regret, but Steins;Gate shows that it is not so simple. The characters learn that although possessing knowledge others do not, that time is difficult to change, and that fate more so is difficult to overcome.This was a brilliant show because it shows the consequences of time travel and how all incidents are related and how certain events become unchangeable.

This is definitely one of the best anime shows I have ever seen. Everything about this show, from the animation to the theme music, is great but I'll list the three best things: Dialogue, Plot and Character Development.The witty flirtatious banter between Okabe and Makise is priceless and reminded me of Spice and Wolf. The Character Development is so well done that you get deeply attached to all the characters, even the bad ones, and makes you keep hoping that they all have happy endings. The Plot is very intelligent and never lets down the suspense in any episode. You cannot wait to find out what happens next and there are many surprises to keep the viewer engrossed till the end. This plot was so good in fact, that one of the English voice actors commented that the lead writer actually cried when his work ended.In conclusion, you'll be doing yourself a great disservice if you pass on this show.

1641264,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B00BZC029G,RavenRing,"[2, 2]","Rintaro Okabe considers himself a mad scientist. He spends most of his time inventing useless gadgets and conceiving wild conspiracy theories. Through sheer luck, he and his friend Itaru Hashida actually create a machine that can send text messages to the past. Through their experimentation and tinkering with time, they keep changing their world, though only Okabe is able to remember the previous timeline. But playing around with something like time is bound to have consequences, as Okabe finds out all too well.....I generally don't have much interest in time travel stories. But if the premise sounds interesting, I'll give it a try. The premise of Steins;Gate sounded vaguely entertaining, but I might not have tried it if it hadn't been streaming on Crunchyroll and had high ratings on AnimeNewsNetwork. The first few episodes were fun, but I wasn't really hooked until around 8 episodes in. That is where the story really starts. And boy, it doesn't let up until the end! The story it very intense and fast paced. It was a rather surprising change, after the laid-back, comedic first few episodes. I went from wanting to see more, to NEEDING to see more. In addition to a great story, this series also has great characters. Okabe is the most interesting, and most developed, since he is the main character, but the others each have their chance to shine.This is one of the best anime series I've see in a while. Possibly the best Sci-Fi anime I've EVER seen. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys an exciting and well woven story. Anyone who enjoys stories that make them think a little. Stories that have wacky characters that you come to love, science fiction, thrill, or mystery.

1641266,A94NOJCJCI6PB,B00BZC029G,Sean,"[1, 1]","The following contains spoilers. Reader discretion is advised.There is something that I must admit before I get too far into praising this anime. I dropped it the first time I watched it. I wasn&#8217;t at all excited by the fact that the plot was moving slowly and the characters sat in a room and didn&#8217;t seem to do much of anything. After being asked to reconsider my thoughts and give Steins;Gate another look, something I rarely do unless someone has a really strong argument for my doing so, I find myself perplexed by the fact I dropped this show that molests your very soul with emotion and feeling, the kind of thing that very few anime have the ability to do.Let me start by addressing why I quit the first time and why I feel stupid for doing so. The slow pace of the first third of the series is actually really well done when you can look back and realize that it is not meant as much to progress the plot at a fast pace, but rather to show off the wide array of characters and get you invested in at least one or even two. Which does happen, believe it or not. Despite only ten episodes or so of this character building, there&#8217;s a certain humanity to every character that you rarely find in a single character in a longer anime. When the entire cast is like that, you know you&#8217;ve reached something akin to god-like.But that&#8217;s not to say the story is something to disregard, because it is also really good. Our main character, Rintaro Okabe, is an eighteen year old scientist who lives in a tiny apartment above an electronics store. He considers himself a mad scientist and has these little bouts where he talks to his cell phone about The Organization catching on to him and his lab. He&#8217;s not really mad, just seemingly bored with his life. He invents quite a few things with his trusty companion Daru, but it&#8217;s within the confines of a basic, uninteresting life. Soon enough, though, he winds up creating a time machine using a microwave. This is where all his troubles start and that boring life he had becomes a life of pain, suffering, and misery, but also a life of new friends and new loved ones.The anime starts with Okabe taking his childhood friend, Mayuri Shiina, to a conference concerning the possibility of time travel. During this conference a strange object crashes into the roof and Okabe finds a young scientist, Makise Kurisu, lying dead in a storage room. From here, things go from bad to weird when he answers a mail and finds himself in a world where Makise is alive and well. On top of that, his texts to Daru had arrived a week early. This leads the members of Okabe&#8217;s Future Gadget Lab to believe that the creation that they have been working on, a modified microwave, is a time machine.  As they learn more about time travel, they find out that SERN, a European organization known for their particle accelerator, already created a time machine, but every experiment they did concerning a physical object turned said object into a gooey, gelatinous mass. They learn that in lieu of physical objects, they can send texts to the past to change the future.With the help of Makise, Okabe winds up finding himself on a variety of world lines, essentially parallel timelines, with every text to the past he makes. With every new line, he seems to be the only person who can remember anything that happened in the previous lines. He eventually winds up in a world line where he decides to make his discovery of a time machine public. Before he can, though, SERN attacks and kills Mayuri, leading him into a continual cycle of going back in time to save her. It never works though. What he eventually learns from a time traveling girl named Suzuha Amane is that in the future, SERN controls everything in a sort of Orwellian dystopia. In order to save the world from that fate, he must return to the original timeline where Mayuri doesn&#8217;t die. To do that, he must undo every text that the members of the lab have sent, as well as his own.Along the way, he discovers he has very deep feelings for Makise, and she for him, and this is all when he realizes that if he returns to the original world line, Mayuri will live, but Makise will die. Despite this, he returns to that line and learns from Suzuha, who has traveled back in time in her time machine, that he can save Makise from dying and prevent World War III by doing so. With that in mind, he proceeds to save Makise, save Mayuri, and save the world.Talk about an epic plot.  It&#8217;s dramatic, it has far reaching consequences, and the plot may start slow, but never lets up after a certain point.As I said previously, Steins;Gate is really as good as it is because of its cast of characters, more so than its plot. Okabe, our hero, is both hilarious and at times, a deeply involving character. While you don&#8217;t see it at first, he has a wide array of emotions aside from arrogant and cocky. He develops so nicely, and while that development isn&#8217;t the deepest of any character ever, it&#8217;s still fun to watch him accept his friends not as much as assistants and more so as family.Makise Kurisu is one of the best tsundere characters to ever grace anime for a number of reasons. First of all, she isn&#8217;t annoying like many characters of her type. She is, in fact, a very smart girl who just has an awkward friendship with a guy who calls her his assistant and treats her like she&#8217;s in on his role plays. The fact of the matter is, despite how much arguing she does with Okabe, the bond that develops between the two is very heartfelt and meaningful. Despite the fact she forgets pretty much every major development that they have with every change in world line (minus the last world line), she still manages to move forward, rather than stay stoic. The fact that she broke Okabe out of his shell and made him show emotions toward another instead of seeming indifference made her just that much better. When she kisses Okabe, it tugs at the heartstrings. It&#8217;s a beautiful moment that isn&#8217;t destroyed by stupidity and never looked back upon as some sort of joke, but it becomes the emotional basis for the final episodes of the series. I, personally, find it to be one of the best relationships in an anime because of how much growth the two go through because of it, and the new Okabe that emerges that will do anything to save his love from dying.The other real major character is Mayuri. I can&#8217;t say a lot about her, because I wasn&#8217;t emotionally invested in her. She was a good character to work off of Okabe and a fun character to watch help him develop, but the only real reason you&#8217;ll probably love her is the fact that Okabe does. You see her die so many times and have to feel those same emotions that Okabe does. It comes as a major surprise that she dies, my jaw dropped when it happened. And dropped again and again. She&#8217;s the sweet, innocent girl who doesn&#8217;t deserve to die, but, as I said, it isn&#8217;t for that reason that you find yourself possibly shedding a manly tear over her, it&#8217;s the fact that Okabe is continually watching his life&#8217;s companion get killed.Ruka is the last character I want to address in any sort of depth. I&#8217;m not a fan of cross-dressers, but he was pretty cute. And she was pretty cute. I was on the fence about his wanting to be a girl. It was a strange area to enter, made stranger by the fact that when he did become a she, Okabe raped her. Made stranger by the fact she&#8217;s in love with him. Maybe it&#8217;s because I was so invested in Okabe that I felt the way I did about he/she. Ruka is cute, but he&#8217;s a guy. The episode where Okabe has to go on a date with female Ruka is pretty hilarious, probably one of the funniest episodes of the series.There are a ton of other characters, but none that are really of a lot of note. I was amazed by the sheer difference in the characters, all of them played off each other well and none were too alike. On top of that, the way they acted was just human enough that it was believable. The writing is so beautiful to be able to evoke emotions and create a world as believable as Steins;Gate&#8217;s.And the cherry on top is the animation. It&#8217;s gorgeous and very distinct. Characters look fantastic and their eyes&#8212;my God their eyes&#8212;I could just swim in those big, beautiful globules forever. There is just something so mesmerizing about looking into Makise&#8217;s eyes, and I don&#8217;t know why, but I feel that it is one of the reasons you invest yourself in the characters. I don&#8217;t know where this came from, and I don&#8217;t have a particular reason to think that, but there has got to be something to those eyes&#8230;Aside from the eyes, the backdrops are typically beautiful, and the only thing I disliked about the animation was the severe contrast of light and dark. I don&#8217;t know if this was meant to help convey emotion or not, but it really didn&#8217;t seem to. When it was sunny out, the screen was burning bright. When the characters were inside of the lab, it was really dark. There was no middle ground, and I did feel that there was a certain dullness to the colors, that while in no way detracting and more so a distinctive trait of the art style, was still sometimes a little hard to look at.If you haven&#8217;t figured it out already, Steins;Gate is an amazing anime. Very rarely does something like this come along that takes you on such an emotional ride, invests you so much in characters that, while fictional, seem like they live and breathe in our world, and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout, wondering (sometimes slack-jawed, sometimes with a tear in your eye, sometimes with a warmness in your chest, sometimes with laughter rising in your throat) what will happen next. While I previously held Puella Magi Madoka Magica as the best anime of 2011, I must kick it off its pedestal and place Steins;Gate where it rightfully belongs, not only as the top anime of 2011, but also one of the top anime of all time. Don&#8217;t be like me and quit because it&#8217;s a little slow, push through those first few episodes and be rewarded with one of the most emotionally satisfying experiences in anime history.",5,One

1641268,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B00BZC029G,Stephen M. Lerch,"[16, 18]","Steins; Gate is a truly original Anime. OK, no story is ever TRULY original now, I know, but the mix included here is.The first bunch of episodes are happy go lucky, in a fun sort of way. Okabe is a mad scientist trying to build a time machine to fight against the ""establishment."" Along for the ride are his friends Mayuri and Haru. When he finds a dead girl at a convention, only to later that day be told he never went to the convention, we realize something is going on. Then when he meets the same girl at a different lecture, we know for sure something's up. As the story progresses we add more female characters (it's not a harem show, I promise!) and a LOT more drama. And they change the past (well, change the past, that changes the future...) with a MICROWAVE and email/text messages!By the end of the first part of Steins; Gate things have gone terribly wrong, with Okabe fighting to retain his sanity and save dear friend.Based on a ""graphic novel"" for the Xbox 360, PS3 and PC (Japanese only), the game was originally designed by Nitro+ and 5pb as a 99% science, 1% fantasy game. It's not difficult to see why they called it so. For those craving the game, JAST USA has announced that, through their partnership with Nitro+, they will be releasing an English localized version of the game on PC eventually.I am reviewing everything below based on the Blu Ray edition of the set. I have not powered up the DVDs and have no need to do so.Video:AVC encoded at 1080p. Bit rates in the 20-32 range mean there is no compression blocking or issues. The only video concern I have is gradients. Sometimes the gradients used have harsh transitions. This is, however, part of the show and NOT a problem with the encode. Other than the gradients in some areas, this release looks fantastic.Audio:You have a choice of spoken English or Japanese on this release.The English audio is mixed in Dolby True HD, 5.1. I don't generally watch Anime English subtitled, but I always watch an episode or 3 for review purposes to give a valid critique. The 5.1 mix, while good, doesn't go over board with mixing effects and putting you in a vortex of sound (which is a good thing!). Dialog from the center channel is crisp and clean. Sound directionality is also very good.The Japanese audio is the original Stereo mix, encoded in Dolby TrueHD as well. The stereo directionality is very good and all dialog ""appears"" in the center of the sound stage, except when needed. Dialog is crisp and clean. Sound effects are good.The subtitles aren't bad, though I did notice a few instances of a grammar issue (outside of the LEET SPEAK).One thing I will note is the FUNimation seems to master their audio at levels similar to Hollywood releases. This means that I have to turn my volume up (NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL!). Sentai, on at least Infinite Stratos, seems to favor mastering much louder (or perhaps it's just these releases?). Neither is a problem, one I turn up, one I turn down and neither, when adjusted to a proper listening volume, causes any issue with the audio.Extras:You have clean opening/closing animations. Episode commentaries for eps 1 and 12 (English language commentary, not a Japanese in case someone wonders). There's a map of Akihabara. Trailers for other FUNimation shows.It seems the only extra that didn't make it over from the Japanese release was a video clip from some Japanese event. This isn't a major loss in my mind, though getting all of the extras available, along with the nice English language extras, is always good.Overall though, the extras are really not that amazing, which is unfortunate given how good the series really is.Packaging:FUNimation has given the show a little extra treatment by including a slip cover. The slip cover is... kind of pointless though, given the artwork and everything is the same as it is on the case proper. Oh well, it's a nice addition either way.There are 2 DVDs and 2 Blu Ray discs inside. The Blu Ray case is a little larger than a single disc case, and all of the discs are securely held on to the hubs.Overall:Steins; Gate Part 1 is a bit of an odd duck. Odd in that it begins with some drama, but then falls into a weird comedy/drama sort of animal... that then morphs into the Groundhog Day/Terminator mix. And what makes it so odd is that it WORKS, and it works amazingly well.If you are a fan of science fiction, this is a series made for you. If you're like my brother and hate time based Sci-Fi, where people are jumping from one time to another and so on, then this one won't be for you. For everyone else, however, this series is a must see.Keep in mind before you buy, if you want to try the series out you can stream it on-line currently via FUNimation's streaming service or Crunchyroll. The free streams are Japanese language with subtitles.HIGHLY recommended.",5,Groundhog Day meets Terminator,1373414400,"07 10, 2013",2013,4832,"['Steins', 'Gate', 'truly', 'original', 'Anime', 'OK',
