It was better because I really did not know what was going to happen. It reminded me of that film 'From Dusk Till Dawn' when half way through, the whole film suddenly turned down a road you did not expect. There is so much going on in this gem of a movie. I have seen it three times. Every time you notice something else. It is confusing at first but stay with it. I thought it was quite clever. Unfortunately not many people have seen it, it went under the radar.It stars Melissa George who used to be in `Home and Away' and you may have seen her in that brilliant television series `The Slap'. She is a very good actress. 'Triangle' is directed by Christopher Smith who gave us the excellent `Creep' which you may recall created a hostile atmosphere within the London UK underground system.The story is about Jess (Melissa George) who is confused, telling her colleagues (when they are all on a comfy little boat trip) she has been there before. Her confusion and concern is a great start to this film. I was a bit cocky watching this film, second guessing where the story was going, my advice is just go with the flow and do your best not to read anything before viewing. The bloody Blu-ray box cover  almost tells you everything! After the film I had some questions I needed answering, so I carried out some online investigation....if you do catch this great film and end up feeling slightly unintelligent and confused like I did, let me know and I'll put you right. As an actor myself I would love to work with Mr Smith the director, his imagination and sense of pace in a scene is dead on target for me. There are some respectful influences here from other films, let me know which ones you reckon they are. I recommend the Blu-ray version of course. By the way `The making of Triangle' is also interesting.My final words about this film is this: If you have experienced those dreams where you are running, but not going anywhere, or calling to someone for help and they can't hear you, and you are so close to them, screaming out with no response....that feeling of sheer frustration will ignite inside you when watching this thrilling film.....Just one question; why do you think the films title is named 'Triangle'?...after you see it let me know.bleedingcriticbleedingfilms.com",5,bleedingfilms.com review of  'TRIANGLE',1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,2394,"['Friends', 'mine', 'insisted', 'watch', 'film', 'knew', 'nothing', 'Triangle', 'experience', 'blew', 'away', 'was', 'better', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'reminded', 'film', 'Dusk', 'Till', 'Dawn', 'when', 'half', 'way', 'whole', 'film', 'suddenly', 'turned', 'down', 'road', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'gem', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'three', 'times', 'time', 'notice', 'something', 'else', 'confusing', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'clever', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'went', 'radar.It', 'Melissa', 'George', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'Home', 'Away', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'brilliant', 'television', 'series', 'Slap', 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'directed', 'Christopher', 'Smith', 'who', 'gave', 'excellent', 'Creep', 'may', 'recall', 'created', 'hostile', 'atmosphere', 'London', 'UK', 'system.The', 'story', 'Jess', 'Melissa', 'George', 'who', 'confused', 'telling', 'colleagues', 'when', 'are', 'comfy', 'little', 'boat', 'trip', 'been', 'before', 'confusion', 'concern', 'great', 'start', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'cocky', 'watching', 'film', 'second', 'guessing', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'advice', 'just', 'go', 'flow', 'do', 'best', 'not', 'read', 'anything', 'viewing', 'bloody', 'Blu-ray', 'box', 'cover', 'almost', 'everything', 'film', 'had', 'questions', 'needed', 'answering', 'carried', 'out', 'online', 'investigation', '.if', 'do', 'catch', 'great', 'film', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'slightly', 'unintelligent', 'confused', 'did', 'let', 'know', ""'ll"", 'put', 'right', 'actor', 'would', 'love', 'work', 'Mr', 'Smith', 'director', 'imagination', 'sense', 'pace', 'scene', 'dead', 'target', 'are', 'respectful', 'influences', 'here', 'other', 'films', 'let', 'know', 'ones', 'reckon', 'are', 'recommend', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'course', 'way', 'making', 'Triangle', 'also', 'interesting.My', 'final', 'words', 'film', 'have', 'experienced', 'dreams', 'where', 'are', 'running', 'not', 'going', 'anywhere', 'calling', 'someone', 'help', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'are', 'so', 'close', 'screaming', 'out', 'response', 'feeling', 'sheer', 'frustration', 'will', 'ignite', 'when', 'watching', 'thrilling', 'film', '..Just', 'one', 'question', 'why', 'do', 'think', 'films', 'title', 'named', 'see', 'let', 'know.bleedingcriticbleedingfilms.com']",N/A
1288940,A39FKP35OY8VM2,B002TVQ4GW,Adam,"[17, 23]","This movie is certainly one of the more unusual ones I've seen, if not the most misleading (in terms of promotion).  The cover art (depending on which one you look at) shows what appears to be some psycho-killer flick with probably a lot of blood and gore, or some weird ghost romp on an abandoned ship in the Bermuda Triangle.  I honestly wouldn't have watched it had I not read reviews that implied it was hardly a cheesy remake of Friday the 13th on a boat.  For a lazy Friday afternoon, I figured it was worth a shot.For the first twenty minutes, I seriously thought all those reviewers had been lying.  ""Triangle"" had the makings of an overdone psycho killer on the sea.  To summarize, Melissa George's character (a single mother of an autistic child) has apparently taken her son to a special school so she can join some friends for a day cruise on a sailboat.  Calling them ""friends"" may be an overstatement, as the group consists of a guy she met at the diner she works at (who invited her along) and all his friends, who don't think to highly of her.  They head out to sea, hear a strange message over the radio, and are abruptly overrun by a storm that capsizes their boat.  After the storm, all seems lost until an eerie old cruise ship appears from nowhere and stops for them.  Despite seeing someone clearly aboard from afar, they find the boat empty, minus some blood and bizarre messages on walls.  Then, people start getting killed... rather quickly in terms of plot, I might add.  It was turning into that campy slasher flick I didn't want to watch and, had I stopped there, that's what I thought it would have been.But, things shifted gears.  Drastically.  It turns out that everything revealed to us thus far is not what it seems.  I won't spoil the twist, but I will emphasize that it makes the movie significantly more interesting.  To make things better, it is hardly the only twist in the film, and the later one is even more shocking.  By the time film reached the end, I felt very satisfied with the 2nd and 3rd acts.  It left a lot of unanswered questions.Overall, I give this film 3 stars.  It still had the makings of a B-rate film, which I am generally not a fan of.  Following the twists, the movie got superbly better, but the 1st act significantly weighed it down to the point where it left a bitter aftertaste.  While I can appreciate the ending, the 1st part needed to be direly improved.  I suggest saving this one for a rental.",3,"Decent B-rate horror film, but don't expect too much",1278633600,"07 9, 2010",2010,2463,"['movie', 'certainly', 'one', 'more', 'unusual', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'not', 'most', 'misleading', 'terms', 'promotion', 'cover', 'art', 'depending', 'one', 'look', 'what', 'be', 'psycho-killer', 'flick', 'probably', 'lot', 'blood', 'gore', 'weird', 'ghost', 'romp', 'abandoned', 'ship', 'Bermuda', 'Triangle', 'honestly', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'watched', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'reviews', 'implied', 'was', 'hardly', 'cheesy', 'remake', 'Friday', '13th', 'boat', 'lazy', 'Friday', 'afternoon', 'figured', 'was', 'worth', 'shot.For', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'seriously', 'thought', 'reviewers', 'had', 'been', 'lying', 'Triangle', 'had', 'makings', 'overdone', 'psycho', 'killer', 'sea', 'summarize', 'Melissa', 'George', 'character', 'single', 'mother', 'autistic', 'child', 'apparently', 'taken', 'son', 'special', 'school', 'can', 'join', 'friends', 'day', 'cruise', 'sailboat', 'Calling', 'friends', 'may', 'be', 'overstatement', 'group', 'guy', 'met', 'diner', 'who', 'invited', 'along', 'friends', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'highly', 'head', 'sea', 'hear', 'strange', 'message', 'radio', 'are', 'abruptly', 'overrun', 'storm', 'boat', 'storm', 'lost', 'eerie', 'old', 'cruise', 'ship', 'nowhere', 'stops', 'seeing', 'someone', 'clearly', 'aboard', 'afar', 'find', 'boat', 'empty', 'blood', 'bizarre', 'messages', 'walls', 'Then', 'people', 'start', 'getting', 'killed', 'rather', 'quickly', 'terms', 'plot', 'might', 'add', 'was', 'turning', 'slasher', 'flick', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'had', 'stopped', 'there', 'what', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'been.But', 'things', 'shifted', 'gears', 'Drastically', 'out', 'everything', 'revealed', 'thus', 'far', 'not', 'what', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'twist', 'will', 'emphasize', 'movie', 'significantly', 'more', 'interesting', 'make', 'things', 'better', 'hardly', 'only', 'twist', 'film', 'later', 'one', 'even', 'more', 'shocking', 'time', 'film', 'reached', 'end', 'felt', 'very', 'satisfied', '2nd', '3rd', 'acts', 'left', 'lot', 'unanswered', 'questions.Overall', 'give', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'still', 'had', 'makings', 'B-rate', 'film', 'am', 'generally', 'not', 'fan', 'Following', 'twists', 'movie', 'got', 'superbly', 'better', '1st', 'act', 'significantly', 'weighed', 'down', 'point', 'where', 'left', 'bitter', 'aftertaste', 'can', 'appreciate', 'ending', '1st', 'part', 'needed', 'be', 'direly', 'improved', 'suggest', 'saving', 'one', 'rental']",N/A

On the ship there is no one around and the group soon find itself stalked by a relentless killer. Now first let me say that this sound like the start of another Bermuda triangle movie, but it is the sail boat which is called Triangle, now for all I know the abandoned ship that pick the group up might be in the Bermuda Triangle but this is never mentioned in the movie. What movie is are a time loop movie, it is Groundhog Day with blood and guts and it do a pretty good job at it.The music of this movie is forgettable but fit the film, the actors do a good job but the characters they portray are pretty cookie cutter but they work for the story. Triangle mange to build up an uneasy atmosphere and it do keep the audience guessing about what will happen next. Visually I think this movie is very good and the camera work do the movie credit.The story of Triangle is quite good, in had a very interesting concept and as a time loop story it is well put together. I do however think that at time the phasing of the movie is a bit off, it get boring in some sections and I was left with the feeling of this being a very interesting story but that it was a bit poorly executed.I recommend Triangle, it is a good movie, I would however recommend that you either rent it or wait until you can get it on sale as it is not quite good enough to warrant a full price purchase. There are great movie who are every film lover's treat, and then there are the good but not great movies that keep us going as we wait for the next gem to pass our way, and Triangle is one of those tide you through movies, it is enjoyable but have some issues, still this movie get my recommendation, especially if you like moody time loop story lines.",3,Interesting time loop movie.,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,1987,"['Triangle', 'group', 'people', 'going', 'out', 'day', 'sailing', 'suddenly', 'are', 'surprised', 'storm', 'shipwrecked', 'group', 'think', 'are', 'saved', 'when', 'are', 'picked', 'up', 'passing', 'ship', 'out', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'nightmare', 'ship', 'one', 'around', 'group', 'soon', 'find', 'stalked', 'relentless', 'killer', 'Now', 'first', 'let', 'say', 'sound', 'start', 'Bermuda', 'triangle', 'movie', 'sail', 'boat', 'called', 'Triangle', 'now', 'know', 'abandoned', 'ship', 'group', 'up', 'might', 'be', 'Bermuda', 'Triangle', 'never', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'What', 'movie', 'are', 'time', 'loop', 'movie', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'blood', 'guts', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'it.The', 'music', 'movie', 'forgettable', 'fit', 'film', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'characters', 'portray', 'are', 'pretty', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'work', 'story', 'Triangle', 'mange', 'build', 'up', 'uneasy', 'atmosphere', 'do', 'keep', 'audience', 'guessing', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'Visually', 'think', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'camera', 'work', 'do', 'movie', 'credit.The', 'story', 'Triangle', 'quite', 'good', 'had', 'very', 'interesting', 'concept', 'time', 'loop', 'story', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'do', 'however', 'think', 'time', 'phasing', 'movie', 'bit', 'off', 'get', 'boring', 'sections', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'being', 'very', 'interesting', 'story', 'was', 'bit', 'poorly', 'executed.I', 'recommend', 'Triangle', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'however', 'recommend', 'rent', 'wait', 'can', 'get', 'sale', 'not', 'quite', 'good', 'enough', 'warrant', 'full', 'price', 'purchase', 'are', 'great', 'movie', 'who', 'are', 'film', 'lover', 'treat', 'then', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'movies', 'keep', 'going', 'wait', 'next', 'gem', 'pass', 'way', 'Triangle', 'one', 'movies', 'enjoyable', 'have', 'issues', 'still', 'movie', 'get', 'recommendation', 'especially', 'moody', 'time', 'loop', 'story', 'lines']",N/A

Deeply engaging plot, well acted and cinematographically beautiful.  As the film progressed, I became increasingly engaged and enthralled with the seemingly impossible ireconcilable plot.

In ancient Greece the belief was that at Death the deceased found themselves in the netherworld on a Riverbank of the River Styx awaiting Charon The Ferryman to appear to take them over the River Styx to the Land Of The Dead (No Return). In order to Take the Dead over to the Other Side the Dead Had To Pay The Ferryman with an Obelos(Coin) Which Was Placed in the Mouth Of The Dead At Death. Little known but believed by the Ancient Greeks and taught by the Stoics is that one could Return and Live Your Own Life Again From Birth to Death. In Order to Do this you had to Drink the Waters Of Another River Called The Lethe the River of Forgetting. The idea was that you would drink the Waters and you would Go Back and Live Your Life Again having forgotten that You Had Lived Your Life Before. Anthony Peake goes into the hard science and neurology of how this occurs in our lives or rather death.  Similar themed films include Slaughterhouse 5, Groundhog Day and also some Twilight Zone episodes. Sparing repetition of other reviewers it is a well acted and directed film on a budget. I picked that it was Australia and not the USA where it was filmed ie the houses, sprinkler, streets, car (even though left hand drive and right side driving) so the location people could have done some more research to convince us that it really was the USA.

1288958,A6J7UPYUI96XO,B002TVQ4GW,"Cory T. Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic""","[3, 6]","""Triangle"" is an astonishingly creepy and unexplainable journey into the realm of the unknown. This film is best described as ""The Twilight Zone meets The Shining"" on a boat (one might notice that the room on the ship where the characters notice the red writing on the mirror is ""Room 237"" which, if you are a fan of ""The Shining,"" then you know the significance of that number.) In this film, a group of friends sets sail and ends up caught in a lightning storm, which sweeps them into an area perhaps similar to the Bermuda Triangle. After they capsize and are forced to board a large sea cruiser, they quickly notice that things are out of sorts. The ship appears to be operating all on its own; there are signs of life, but no bodies. No crew. Set primarily on the large and seemingly abandoned boat, it seems that George's character has been there before. As she is experiencing a strange form of deja vu, the reasons revealed for this is both stunningly unpredictable and utterly unexplainable.This is an eerie, moody film - at times almost noir - that is not only carried, but dominated by the performance of Melissa George, in what might end up being an epic star turn for her, like ""The Ring"" was to Naomi Watts. She is the focal point of the film, and excels in that role. I'm not going to give anyting away, other than to remind the viewer that often times in films like this, you have to suspend disbelief and keep in mind that some things are simply unexplained. This film is truly creepy in that regard. This film is really something to behold, both visually and atmospherically. It won't make you yell at the screen too much, but you might be caught staring at the screen in a bewildered manner on several occasions. I would rate this four stars if not for the performance by George.

In Timecrimes, the main character is involved and can break the loop easily but doesn't. Here, the main character wants to break the loop but cannot.These types of movies seem impossible to me to write, but this script makes it look almost easy. All the scenes are revisited (often more than once) and each revisiting helps pull the entire thing tighter and make it all the more understandable. And scenes you thought were ""throwaway"" or merely exposition all come back to have an integral part in the plot. These types of movies can be a chore to follow because the plot is always bending back on itself, but again, here I never once found myself scratching my head trying to figure things out. Everything happened in a way where the plot unfolded like a flower.Melissa George was the only actor recognizable to me and she does a very good job. The rest of the cast does a decent enough job, but no one stuck out as being particularly bad or good.The ending is also way cool. It's like a dream within a dream, or in this case, a loop within a loop. The viewer is lulled into a sense of ending only to be be treated to a rather disturbing reality.This is just a really cool flick with adroit direction, good sound, editing and music score.

That, and it shares some commonalities with it, as well, aside from being a great movie.  I'll admit that about 30 minutes in I already knew basically what was going to happen--but there were still enough twists and turns to keep me surprised at the moment-to-moment events, and each time I thought I'd figured out exactly how it worked, there was something more around the corner.  Combined with the way little things from earlier in the movie kept coming back, it kept me going ""Oh... ohhh, that's why..."" right up to the end.  Other reviewers have noted that the first few minutes are really confusing--they really should be, because suddenly understanding why it all made sense is what delivers the impact at the end.On a level, the characters' lack of genre-savviness was aggravating in places, but I can forgive them considering the circumstances; and that not everyone's a scifi nerd.  Avoiding spoilers, if you like stories where the plot seems scattered and incomprehensible at times, but you get to watch all the dots connect as you go and by the end it's all come together (e.g., The Time Traveler's Wife and a lot of Dr. Who episodes by Moffat, especially ""Big Bang"") you'll probably love Triangle.If there's a problem, it's that I'm left wondering what happens from the outside world's perspective, since the story almost exclusively follows one character's point of view.

A small group of passengers on a sailboat meets very strange weather conditions and have to jump onto another ship to discover more mystery than they could have bargained for.This is one of the most thoughtful scripts I have ever seen in a movie. Every scene, every line of dialogue is there for a meaningful reason and several portions will click later on so this mind-bending experience will give your brain a lot to chew on. Melissa George stars as Jess, mother of autistic child, Tommy (Joshua McIvor) who just wants a nice day off to relax and go sailing, but things are going wrong. There are tensions on-board the boat since Greg (Michael Dorman), the captain is being set up with a girl his friends brought and the most mysterious storm any of them have ever seen creeps up suddenly and capsizes the boat leaving them stranded when another boat drifts by and they climb aboard. But where are the passengers?Without giving spoilers away, an intense psychological dilemma ensues as Jess is locked into a series of events that push some hard choices. The best part about this movie is trying to figure out how much Jess is locked into her fate and how much she can change about her circumstances. Melissa George has a LOT on her plate here in terms of screen time and difficulty and does a phenomenal job showing the downward spiral as the pressure begins to get to her.If you like ""Memento"" or ""The Prestige"", you should check this one out because it has a few similar ideas to see how far you would go for something you want under assumed conditions.

Possibly even a Dead Calm type scenario since they're on a yacht after all. It is sort of some of those things but it's a lot more complicated a plot than one you can enjoy if you are tired and just want something simple to sit back on the couch to watch before calling it a night. It's best to actually stop reading here if you haven't seen it yet, not knowing anything about this film will help you enjoy it the most, but if you're still undecided whether to give it a go, I'll tell you how it starts in the next paragraph.The confusion starts right at the beginning of this one, the words on the screen tell us it is funded by the UK lotteries, yet the scenery and houses and buildings are clearly Australian, including electrical sockets, yet for some reason the vehicles on screen are those only found in North America and they are driving in the right hand lane, which is incorrect for the UK or Australia.  Also these British actors are talking with fake American accents. Is this all deliberate though? This bizarre scenario is only the tip of the iceberg once the movie gets going and the yacht hits a storm that is obviously more supernatural in origin than anything that should be possible to be encountered. Things don't look good survival wise until an old passenger ship appears which seems deserted, but the group know they saw someone on board from their upturned yacht. Why has no one come to meet them?  Where is everyone?  What's with that message in blood on a mirror?I won't mention anything else about the plot but you've got to be paying attention the whole time to understand (or come close to it, as fully doing so is probably not possible), no getting up to make something to eat and coming back minutes later, no going to the bathroom, if you do you'll miss little cultural references such as to the Shining, you'll miss clues such as the name of the ship being important to what is happening.  Even if you are paying attention, you'll still probably miss a lot of it or it will go over your head unless you are some sort of scholar of non famous to many, European mythology, it did mine. That's why I only rate this film three stars, even though yes it is being clever, but you shouldn't finish watching a film and have to say huh? What the f was that about?  Maybe if I go back and, hey look at the name of the ship, let's Google that and see what results we get. Ohhh, so that's what that scene about.  Cultural references should be to things the majority of viewers would know, if they aren't then they need to be introduced or explained in the film by the characters or something like this before the parodying begins.I had to come on here and read other people's reviews to know stuff such as (and going over these gives away more spoilers) that Aeolus is a Greek ruler of the winds.  Therefore it is assumed by some people you should instantly know from the ship's name, that the timeline repetition for the main character is obviously referring to another Greek myth about someone called Sisyphus who was condemned to roll a boulder up a hill yet it would always roll back down so he would have to keep doing it over and over again.I think knowing how the film ends, and knowing the cultural references that this would be a more enjoyable movie to appreciate as a second viewing than was possible the first time round.  However it's just not that entertaining a film to want to see it a second time round.  That's coming from someone who lives on the Gold Coast where this thing was filmed and have the hey there's the Southport Yacht Club and various other landmarks to point out to myself while watching it.",3,"Not a Movie to Watch if You've Just Got Home Exhausted From Work, As it's a Complicated Plot, Full of Clues& Cultural References",1360195200,"02 7, 2013",2013,3951,"['someone', 'told', 'what', 'Triangle', ""'re"", 'probably', 'going', 'insert', 'DVD', 'player', 'sit', 'back', 'expect', 'be', 'brainless', 'slasher', 'flick', 'sea', 'ghost', 'ship', 'flick', 'supernatural', 'beings', 'messing', 'well', 'sort', 'fun', 'demise', 'viewing', 'group', 'attractive', 'young', 'adults', 'movie', 'Possibly', 'even', 'Dead', 'Calm', 'type', 'scenario', ""'re"", 'yacht', 'sort', 'things', 'lot', 'more', 'complicated', 'plot', 'one', 'can', 'enjoy', 'are', 'tired', 'just', 'want', 'something', 'simple', 'sit', 'back', 'couch', 'watch', 'calling', 'night', 'best', 'actually', 'stop', 'reading', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'not', 'knowing', 'anything', 'film', 'will', 'help', 'enjoy', 'most', ""'re"", 'still', 'undecided', 'give', 'go', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'how', 'next', 'paragraph.The', 'confusion', 'right', 'beginning', 'one', 'words', 'screen', 'tell', 'funded', 'UK', 'lotteries', 'yet', 'scenery', 'houses', 'buildings', 'are', 'clearly', 'Australian', 'including', 'electrical', 'sockets', 'yet', 'reason', 'vehicles', 'screen', 'are', 'only', 'found', 'North', 'America', 'are', 'driving', 'right', 'hand', 'lane', 'incorrect', 'UK', 'Australia', 'Also', 'British', 'actors', 'are', 'talking', 'fake', 'American', 'accents', 'deliberate', 'bizarre', 'scenario', 'only', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'movie', 'going', 'yacht', 'storm', 'obviously', 'more', 'supernatural', 'origin', 'anything', 'should', 'be', 'possible', 'be', 'encountered', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'good', 'survival', 'wise', 'old', 'passenger', 'ship', 'deserted', 'group', 'know', 'saw', 'someone', 'board', 'upturned', 'yacht', 'Why', 'one', 'come', 'meet', 'Where', 'everyone', 'What', 'message', 'blood', 'mirror', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'anything', 'else', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'got', 'be', 'paying', 'attention', 'whole', 'time', 'understand', 'come', 'close', 'fully', 'doing', 'so', 'probably', 'not', 'possible', 'getting', 'up', 'make', 'something', 'eat', 'coming', 'back', 'minutes', 'later', 'going', 'bathroom', 'do', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'little', 'cultural', 'references', 'such', 'Shining', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'clues', 'such', 'name', 'ship', 'being', 'important', 'what', 'happening', 'Even', 'are', 'paying', 'attention', ""'ll"", 'still', 'probably', 'miss', 'lot', 'will', 'go', 'head', 'are', 'sort', 'scholar', 'non', 'famous', 'many', 'European', 'mythology', 'did', 'mine', 'why', 'only', 'rate', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'even', 'yes', 'being', 'clever', 'should', ""n't"", 'finish', 'watching', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'huh', 'What', 'f', 'was', 'Maybe', 'go', 'back', 'hey', 'look', 'name', 'ship', 'let', 'Google', 'see', 'what', 'results', 'get', 'Ohhh', 'what', 'scene', 'Cultural', 'references', 'should', 'be', 'things', 'majority', 'viewers', 'would', 'know', 'are', ""n't"", 'then', 'need', 'be', 'introduced', 'explained', 'film', 'characters', 'something', 'parodying', 'begins.I', 'had', 'come', 'here', 'read', 'other', 'people', 'reviews', 'know', 'stuff', 'such', 'going', 'away', 'more', 'spoilers', 'Aeolus', 'Greek', 'ruler', 'winds', 'assumed', 'people', 'should', 'instantly', 'know', 'ship', 'name', 'timeline', 'repetition', 'main', 'character', 'obviously', 'referring', 'Greek', 'myth', 'someone', 'called', 'Sisyphus', 'who', 'was', 'condemned', 'roll', 'boulder', 'up', 'hill', 'yet', 'would', 'always', 'roll', 'back', 'down', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'keep', 'doing', 'again.I', 'think', 'knowing', 'how', 'film', 'knowing', 'cultural', 'references', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'appreciate', 'second', 'viewing', 'was', 'possible', 'first', 'time', 'round', 'However', 'just', 'not', 'entertaining', 'film', 'want', 'see', 'second', 'time', 'round', 'coming', 'someone', 'who', 'Gold', 'Coast', 'where', 'thing', 'was', 'filmed', 'have', 'hey', 'Southport', 'Yacht', 'Club', 'various', 'other', 'landmarks', 'point', 'out', 'watching']",N/A

The more you see this, the more the subtleties will surface and the more you will take away from this. Some movies require you to work... to use your brain and dissect certain scenes.

She really goes for it and doesn't hold anything back.  It's not often that someone that beautiful is also a great actress, and I don't know why she isn't more well-known than she is.  But I'm sure she's got a long career ahead of her, if we're lucky.I am really a sucker for these kind of movies.  I would place this is in the same category as The Machinist, Eternal Sunshine, Memento, and Mulholland Drive.  I won't say much more than that because, in my opinion, absolutely anything I would say to try to describe it would be a spoiler.  You really need to just press play and pay attention.

Not quite the same ballpark here.  Not that Saw is a bad movie.

The rest of the film is for you to discover... Let's just say one thing - one should REALLY think twice before boarding the Flying Dutchman, because there may very well be NO ESCAPE from this seven times cursed ship!The atmosphere in ""Triangle"" is a mixture of weird and scary, but even if it progressively gets scarier and scarier it never gets too weird. The director kept the film very strictly under control and therefore there is no obvious plot holes or useless scenes. Thanks God there is also no any kind of absurd ""final battle"" scenes which hurt so many thrillers and horrors. The ending (last 5 minutes) is quite clever - and chilling... Melissa George did a very very good job in this film and helped a lot to make it a success as her character (Jess) is the center of all the story and all other actors play (very honestly) supporting roles.""Triangle"" may not be a masterpiece, but it is one of the best, most intelligent, scariest and best made horrors I saw in recent years.

1289005,AO65T0JON8R80,B002TVQ4GW,Michele Lyons,"[5, 12]","This movie actually turned out to be more entertaining than I had thought  it would be. Still, I would advise people to see it on cable or rent it, rather than spend money to buy it. It is not a movie worth seeing a second time.The title of this movie ""Triangle"" is misleading.  Many people (myself included) expected a ""Bermuda Triangle"" type film, and this it definitely is not.  Nor is it strictly speaking a time travel movie. The title reflects the name of the boat that the characters are travelling on, and I think they should have changed the name of the movie to avoid confusion. This movie reminded me of nothing so much as an elongated ""twilight zone"" episode.  During the film, the viewer thinks that it is both, because at first the main characters are ship wrecked by a very creepy and unnatural storm, and then are saved when they board a strangely deserted old luxury ocean liner that cruses past them. One by one they are killed by a mysterious figure, leaving only the main heroine alive. After she stumbles around, in and out of the endless rooms of the ship, she suddenly finds herself looking over the ships rail seeing (amazingly) herself and her friends, standing on their overturned boat----just as they had been several hours before!  Obviously, the heroine has somehow jumped backward in time---and maybe has a chance to save everyone, right?  Not exactly.We now follow the heroine through a long and convoluted series of actions which she hopes will allow her to escape the ocean liner. It seems as if she is going through a series of time loops----repeating the same series of events again and again, trying to get a different outcome. (rather like the movie Groundhog's Day, but without the wacky comedy) But at the same time, there is chilling evidence that she is not exactly experiencing a time loop---at least not in the way that we are familiar with from science fiction. In several places in the movie, she comes across (impossible) physical evidence that she has done this same thing,taken this same path many, many times.  One of these points was when she falls and her necklace drops off and it falls through a grating.  When she looks through the grating, she sees, in the compartment below, hundreds of copies of her necklace! I thought that this part was well plotted and very chilling.When the movie was over, basically coming in a full circle to begin again, I was put very much in mind of the old ""Twiligh Zone"" episodes. Close to the movie's end, we see the heroine after having suffered a terrible car crash. And she is untouched, unharmed, even her hair is not mussed. Even if she has somehow returned back through time, she could not have survived that accident. Is she dead? If so, it is not the common ghost that we usually see in fiction.  She seems to be fully flesh and blood. So what is the explanation?Suppose we are not seeing someone trapped in a linear storyline or a time loop? Suppose we are viewing the sufferings of a damned soul in hell? What hell could be worse than to forever relive the most terrible events of your life, trying in vain to change them, over and over and over, forever?  That is something worthy of the devil himself!And why would I think that the heroine might be a damned soul?  Well, we see reasons for it in her actions during the movie. She puts on an act that she is devoted to her small son, but the fact is she abuses the child both physically and mentally. And gives herself all kinds of excuses for it. And she is selfish in the extreme, showing herself to be fully willing to sacrifice others to save herself or serve her own purpose. Even at the end of the movie, when she finds herself once again at the beginning, ready to set sail with her four friends in the ""Triangle"", she does nothing to try to stop the series of events.  She could refuse to get on the boat, stop her friends from going, sabotage the boat, push everybody off the dock into the water, almost anything. But she doesn't.  I know people may say it was because she wanted to take the chance that this time around she could change things, and make her son alive again (her son having been killed in the car crash) but I don't buy that explanation. What about the four other innocent people, supposedly her friends?  She shows indifference to their suffering, their dying. She lacks a core of humanity, and again is selfish. She wants her own way, even though it means her friends will suffer and die in order to serve her purpose. Her soul is rotten. And the audience may be privy to her punishment.At any rate, that is my take on this movie, although I do not know if that is what the writers or directors considered.  You have to stick with the film, even when it seems to get bogged down, and stay through all the convoluted plotting. It turned out to be a lot more interesting than I had expected.

There are way too many careless spoilers, invalid references, and just plain ignorance by people who don't like thinking.  Luckily I did not read any reviews, and was planning on just playing it in the background while I worked.  Well, I did not get any work done. I was glued the entire time.If you are expecting a film of gore with no plot and just killing for no reason, this is not the movie for you. People are making comparisons to other movies, and again, all I can say is do not read any reviews, good or bad. If you get a hint of a movie title to compare it to, it will be ruined.  But, it is not a copy of anything I have ever seen. But there is a unique genre, so to speak, that would bring several titles into comparison.I have no clue who any of the actors are, and I am just now looking for more by Director, Christopher Smith.  He was also the writer of this flick, so I am dually impressed.  The lead is Melissa George, and never heard of her, but appears she had significant television roles. Such as ""Grey's Anatomy"", of which I could never watch, and ""Alias"", among many others.  She was also in a bigger movie called ""Turistas"" which I saw, and don't remember her, but this movie is so much better than that mess.This movie will play with your head.  You have no idea what is going on until it builds and comes together. And just when you think you know what is going to happen, you don't.  Unfortunately there would be many viewers that would not be able to watch this as they were impatiently waiting for hacking with T&A.;  Though there is blood, it is not too bad.After reading some of the titles of these ""reviews"", even those are giving away too much.  I did the free stream with Amazon Prime. But, I actually have to watch it again, so I guess it's another ""2hrs I will never get back"".  But this time I am getting the DVD.

1289016,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B002TVQ4GW,Only-A-Child,"[48, 53]","This comment contains some spoilers.If you like Melissa George then 2009's ""Triangle"" is a must see. She is on screen for about 90% of this 99-minute psychological horror feature. By far her most challenging role to date; she gets a lot of tight close-ups, a number of action sequences, and a character that is all over the map emotionally (must have been exhausting). The entire feature is told from her character's point-of-view (POV); and she does a good job of getting viewers to identify with her character.Basically the story is weird mix of ""Ghost Ship"" (2002); ""The Butterfly Effect"" (2004), and ""Groundhog Day"" (1993); with a little bit of Julianne Moore's ""Freedomland"" (2006) thrown in for good measure. Even the POV twist was done recently in the minimalist Spanish film ""Timecrimes""; although here it is more central to the plot.But what makes the cobbled together mix of other movie elements special is more than the way they are mixed together or its intriguing POV twist. It is the introduction of Greek mythology as the story's primary thematic element. Specifically it is a retelling of the myth of Sisyphus, a man the gods had condemned to a hell of ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, at which time it would roll back to the bottom. The Gods had it in for Sisyphus who had been able to cheat death for a period through a deception. They thought with some justification that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor. There has been a long debate about whether it would have been better or worse for Sisyphus to know in advance that the rock was simply going to roll back down each time. Most jobs require a worker to spend their career at the same tasks, a fate just as absurd, but only tragic when they become conscious of the fact. Many believe that Sisyphus surmounts his fate by scorning it.  The concept has been extensively examined by existential thinkers.Jess, George's character, is busy processing her fate during each cycle but just as she is almost fully clued in she goes to sleep and loses all but a vague sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu about her surroundings.My ""speculative"" read on the story is that the process started when she killed her autistic son in a moment of frustration. Regretting her act she made a bargain with death (symbolized by the sea gulls that appear at various times in the film). She will give up her life in exchange for being allowed to go back to the moment of her son's murder and prevent it. But after preventing the murder she tries to renege on the agreement, driving away with her son. Death then subjects her to a punishment in the tradition of Sisyphus.This is a relatively low budget film ($12 Million) in which almost all the budget makes in onto the screen. There is excellent production design throughout the film and just enough special effects to complement the storyline without calling attention to themselves. Likewise there is enough gore to meet the genre's quota but not so much that it distracts from the basic story.It is all about point-of-view and a good example for film students of the power this device can bring to a film if used effectively. Even if the story is not your ""cup of tea"", the film is worthwhile viewing just to expand your understanding of how to read films.Finally, there is a subtle but pervasive homage to Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" (1980).

But it definitely belongs on a shelf above the vast majority of horror flicks, and it does indeed share the same type of resolutely non-linear plot that Nolan and Lynch eventually mastered.  Even Christopher Nolan had to practice for Memento (see his excellent first movie, ""Following""); as Nolan says, a non-linear story aimed at snaring and then challenging the viewer is probably the most difficult to film.  And I think this Aussie film, co-written and directed by Christopher Smith, is a surprisingly good first attempt at same.I'd like to see more of Smith's films in the future.  As other reviewers noted, Triangle is well-crafted, with high production values and a subtle, perfectly effective score.  I expect to watch it a few times, as I did with Memento and Mulholland drive -- I think Triangle invites and deserves repeated viewing.Of course, no review of Triangle would be complete without a mention of Melissa George -- she of the short-shorts and not-very-nautical high heels.  She is blessed with two of the best legs in cinema, shown off very well in the movie, but, alas, she also has only two expressions in the film: anxious and very anxious.

I'm not sure if this means I'm more critical of technical details or more open to ludicrous ideas being great, but either way, there you go. And I will leave it to you to decide which of these things is the case when it comes to Triangle, the most recent film from Severance director Christopher Smith (not to be confused with American Movie director Chris Smith, by the way). Unfortunately, I can't leave ti to you in this review, as that would constitute major spoilers; you'll have to see it for yourself. And lest I sound like this review is going to be all gloom and doom, you should see it. With the caveat that it's the same kind of ""should"" that has teachers assigning you Sir Walter Scott in high school; you'll be better for the experience, but you might not enjoy it.The movie starts off with a bunch of folks going off on a three-hour tour. There's Greg (The Secret Life of Us' Michael Dorman), the scruffy, lovable skipper, and his mate Victor (Liam Hensworth, recently of Knowing, and best-known these days as the boyfriend of Miley Cyrus). Then there's Greg's ex Sally (MacLeod's Daughters' Rachel Carpani), her beau Downey (Noise's Henry Nixon), and Heather (The Heist's Emma Lung), because Sally always, Greg tells us, brings alongs a nubile young thing to set him up with. Except this time he's got someone along he's interested in already, Jess (Turistas' Melissa George), a waitress at a diner Greg frequents who's badly damaged from a former relationship (this is never explicitly stated, but you can gather it from the opening sequence; Jess has a child). All of this is setup, then we wander into a freak thunderstorm that capsizes the boat. After some time floating about, they find themselves a cruise liner, and it swings by to pick them up. That's when everything gets weird. Weirder still, Jess feels like she's been there before...You may actually have figured out the Big Twist (which in this movie is separate from the Big Reveal, which is kinda nice) just for the bare-bones synopsis of the first twenty minutes you got there (and if you read any of the studio's promo materials, they're even less cagey about it). But I won't give it away, because part of the fun of the movie is getting to the first (false) climax and asking yourself what they're going to do for the next sixty-five minutes, then finding out. It's fun stuff, and it's not a bad little stable of actors, though I'm not sure Melissa George is quite good enough yet to carry a movie on her own. I love her as an ensemble player (Turistas is a movie I return to again and again), but in both 30 Days of Night and Triangle, I felt something lacking when she was elevated above the rest of the cast. I'm not sure exactly what, and I'm certain this isn't a permanent condition for her (it could certainly be the material in both cases), but it left me feeling vaguely dissatisfied once again. Most of the rest of the cast here just seems to be kind of playing along, bored (Lung and Nixon are exceptions, and of course their parts are the smallest of the main characters). The direction is competent, if not inspired, and the sets are very well-done, and for much of the film lend it an air of creepiness lacking in many of the other haunted-ship flicks that have come across the bow recently. The big problem is that the intricacy of the plot spirals out of control towards the end, and whether you're satisfied by the film's resolution or not seems, from what I'm reading on the net, to depend on how much time you spend thinking about the last couple of scenes (and/or talking them out with others); I'm still waffling. It's solid enough to hold water, but like other aspects of this movie, it seemed like there could have been more. ** ",3,Almost.

I think this is only because the film was marketed to the wrong crowd so the wrong folks are watching it.  This is not a Bermuda Triangle, Freddy Kruger, or Friday The 13 type of horror, Sci-Fi or slasher flick.  Triangle is more along the lines Mulholland Drive, Angle Heart, Memento, The Shining or even Repulsion.I will say for the first 15 minutes or so the movie seems kind of lame and for a time things may not seem to make much sense as characters make bizarre decisions - so you have to stick with it.But once Triangle kicks in (I wish I could tell you how and why it kicks in - but your better off not knowing anything about this film) Triangle is a really good, nightmare of a film.  Carefully and lovingly staged and edited by the filmmakers with very good performances photography and soundtrack.The entire cast is excellent.  The cast are playing American archetypes (not stereo types) - If you are an American who lives near the ocean you will instantly be familiar with these folks of various classes and relationships. All the actors are flawless in that they do not draw attention to their acting but instead simply become the characters - which is the ideal.

Schultz,"[3, 6]","This is a good thriller, with Melissa George turning in an intelligent, haunted performance.At several points it seems as if it is going to reprise some other well-known movies that involve terror at sea. As the friends set out in their yacht for a pleasant, unsuspecting day - a strange storm cloud overtakes them, suggesting the transformation that created ""The Incredible Shrinking Man."" Later, as they board the seemingly deserted, antique ocean liner, we think of movies such as ""Outward Bound"" with its cast doomed to sail in limbo. Then when we realize that the ship might not be deserted enough, that there might be a homicidal maniac aboard - we think of movies such as the Billy Zane/Nicole Kidman thriller ""Dead Calm.""However the movie doesn't follow closely in the wake of any of these movies. It sets off into uncharted territory of its own. Although some of the assaults seem a little too repetitious, the atmospherics aboard the liner are likely to hold you in suspense.But this isn't a movie for those who demand pat answers. However I suggest you check out the brief bonus materials on the DVD. There's no Director's Commentary, but there is a short series of interviews with some of the stars and other people involved in the making of ""Triangle.""

So when this movie came out, I was really excited to watch it. Like another reviewer on here, I quickly developed a headache that wouldn't quit, even after the movie had ended.What didn't make sense was how the main female character could have 2 or more versions of herself walking around in the same reality. Nor did she ever once get everyone together in the same room, including the clone of herself, and try to figure this out. She spent more time running around the freaking ship than she did actually talking to anybody. And finally, no explanation is ever given as to how or why she got herself caught up in this in the first place. No explanation in why the ship is out there, nor why she keeps repeating the day/events over and over again. Why was it necessary to kill everyone? They just never explained a lot of things, and by the end of the movie, I just wanted to trash it.Frankly, I was more upset with the main character's stupidity throughout the whole movie than anything else. She kept acting like she was zoned out, and that was before anything weird had happened. If she didn't have her memory of the events when she first stepped onto the boat at the beginning of the movie, why is she zoned out?Take my advice.

Wells had penned his first science fiction novel the brilliant ""The Time Machine"" but ""time loops"" are a more recent sub-genre of time travel made popular by ""Ground Hog Day"". GHD has even become a term in Quantum Mechanics and was mentioned in ""Triangle"". The basic theme of time loops is that the hero/heroes relive the same period of time over and over in hopes to make changes which might make a better future. Jess, the heroine of the story, is reliving an ocean voyage and is the only one of her friends who realizes they are caught in a time loop. The greatest problem with time loop stories is the they create faults which cancel out the logic of the story such as the famous Grandfather Paradox where a person kills his own grandfather making it impossible for him to have existed and travel back in time to kill his own grandfather. As one person pointed out the looped car accident could not have happened over and over or else there would have been a pile of broken cars and bodies, the accumulation shown by the pile of dead sea gulls. However, anomalies do occur in the story, for example, in one loop Jess never interacts with the new group while in another loop she holds a shotgun on her other self. The traffic accident could have been one of these anomalies and not part of the loop.

He's been making films since 1997 however this is only his 5th movie to date. This one though has made me want to see where he is going as a filmmaker and excited about his 6th film which comes out next year. While I can't claim that this was the best horror film that I've seen this year the unique way it was presented with such a very underused premise was brilliant to watch.The story involves a group of 'friends' who are going out to sea on a yacht for the day. By group of friends I of course mean they all know the owner of the yacht but really don't know each other for the most part making it hard for them to easily interact with one another. It's a great reason on bringing a group of strangers together that makes sense without having to try to bring up a long and drawn out back story. All you need to do is focus on the potential love interest of the owner of the yacht - Jess. A single mother and clearly out of it Jess is the major character to follow throughout this story as she is the first to realize something is out of the norm.While at sea there is a flash storm of epic proportions that destroys the yacht and we see the group survive and picked up by a passing ocean liner. I use picked up rather loosely as it pulls up right next to them and they hop on without it stopping. It's not every day where you see an ocean liner that is apparently empty of passengers and crew alike. While it appears deserted you know as well as I that while watching a horror movie a deserted area is never truly deserted and soon after the killing starts. Someone is hunting this group of friends.Now when you have such a small group of people that been rescued you would wonder how they can all be killed rather quickly and still allow the movie to easily go forward? Without realistically spoiling a single thing they are quickly removed and it quickly becomes clear that ""Jess"" is both the main character and the only one that matters. However, this is quickly shown how it is possible though the explanation isn't readily apparent until further into the movie. There is a twist that comes up that reminds me of a few science fiction plots I have seen in my day though never put into such a fun horror themed world. It's hard to go into great detail with the story line without touching on what the twist is or how it plays out, which is a shame because said twist is what will make or break the movie for you.The film itself carries through to the end and has a strong finish that makes you truly feel that you finally see what is actually going on. It's not a 'unique' idea in horror but one that is rarely used and never quite like this.

Please feel free to share your personal, thoughtful insights via ""Comments"" at the end of this revue.SPOILER ALERT: This is ONLY for those who have already seen the movie.We repeatedly see physical evidence of the large number of times that Jess has gone through the loops and cycles of her alternate reality. We see piles of bodies,  lockets, and seagulls which are all either on the ""ghost ship"" or out of sight behind a seawall, and thus not evident to the general public. Apparently, in this movie, at the conclusion of each ""loop"" all evidence that accumulated during the loop remains intact; unlike, say, Groundhog Day, where the evidence of each loop is wiped clean, allowing the protagonist to start from scratch each day with only his/her memory of events to aid them in pursuing a better path.Here is my problem. Apparently Jess and her son are killed in a car wreck at least once for every dead seagull, and there appear to be at least 35 or 40 dead seagulls. The dead seagulls may be out of sight, but 35 or 40 identical and dramatic car wrecks involving the same two fatalities in the same spot day after day would, to put it mildly, attract attention. You cannot have it both ways. Either all physical evidence is wiped clean after each cycle, or all of it persists, including the memories of the many bystanders and 40 identical, wrecked cars and semi tractors at the police impound lot. You cannot have a pile of dead seagulls and only one wreck. You cannot have 40 wrecks without the cycles becoming public knowledge. Indeed, you would probably have a huge crowd gather each day to witness them, and Jess's private hell would become a media event.It may be a small point, but the writer/director consciously chose a path that is visually shocking (accumulated evidence); yet they either ignored or failed to consider that this accumulated evidence opens a hole in the plot you could drive a truck through.....literally.",4,"It's a Good Movie, but with A Major Plot Error",1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,2107,"['Overall', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'complexity', 'sophistication', 'movie', 'generally', 'did', 'enjoy', '.but', 'remain', 'troubled', 'one', 'significant', 'plot', 'issue', 'Please', 'feel', 'free', 'share', 'personal', 'thoughtful', 'insights', 'Comments', 'end', 'revue.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'ONLY', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'movie.We', 'repeatedly', 'see', 'physical', 'evidence', 'large', 'number', 'times', 'Jess', 'gone', 'loops', 'cycles', 'alternate', 'reality', 'see', 'piles', 'bodies', 'lockets', 'seagulls', 'are', 'ghost', 'ship', 'sight', 'seawall', 'thus', 'not', 'evident', 'general', 'public', 'Apparently', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'loop', 'evidence', 'accumulated', 'loop', 'intact', 'say', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'where', 'evidence', 'loop', 'wiped', 'clean', 'allowing', 'protagonist', 'start', 'scratch', 'day', 'only', 'memory', 'events', 'aid', 'pursuing', 'better', 'path.Here', 'problem', 'Apparently', 'Jess', 'son', 'are', 'killed', 'car', 'wreck', 'least', 'once', 'dead', 'seagull', 'there', 'appear', 'be', 'least', '35', '40', 'dead', 'seagulls', 'dead', 'seagulls', 'may', 'be', 'sight', '35', '40', 'identical', 'dramatic', 'car', 'wrecks', 'involving', 'same', 'two', 'fatalities', 'same', 'spot', 'day', 'day', 'would', 'put', 'mildly', 'attract', 'attention', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'ways', 'physical', 'evidence', 'wiped', 'clean', 'cycle', 'including', 'memories', 'many', 'bystanders', '40', 'identical', 'wrecked', 'cars', 'semi', 'tractors', 'police', 'impound', 'lot', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'pile', 'dead', 'seagulls', 'only', 'one', 'wreck', 'can', 'not', 'have', '40', 'wrecks', 'cycles', 'becoming', 'public', 'knowledge', 'Indeed', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'huge', 'crowd', 'day', 'witness', 'Jess', 'private', 'hell', 'would', 'become', 'media', 'event.It', 'may', 'be', 'small', 'point', 'writer/director', 'consciously', 'chose', 'path', 'visually', 'shocking', 'accumulated', 'evidence', 'either', 'ignored', 'failed', 'consider', 'accumulated', 'evidence', 'hole', 'plot', 'could', 'drive', 'truck', '..literally']",N/A

Triangle has a really great cast and some very memorable scenes, but the story goes around in circles, to a point that's beyond Groundhog's Day, stopping at frustration. The story follows a group of friends that go sailing on a boat called the Triangle. While they are leaving from Florida, there is never any mention of the Bermuda Triangle. Everything is going well, when a sudden freak storm appears, capsizing the small vessel. As they hang onto the remains of the boat, they find a cruise ship passing by and hop on, but to their dismay, they find the huge ship to be empty. The story here is very cleaver and original, I was really into this film at first, however the Writer/Director, Christopher Smith, goes too far, making it one of those film, you really want to just be over and done with. Melissa George plays the lead and she was terrific. It's George's performance that kept me watching the movie, even after I had become bored with it. In Triangle, she's paired with a very young, Liam Hemsworth, in his first major film role. Even at the young age of 19, you can see just how good he is. Acting seems to come natural to him and after the Hunger Games series, I expect big things from him. Triangle is an extremely interesting idea, but it's not for everybody. It's one of those weird Science Fiction films that tows the line for a while, but ultimately goes too far and becomes weird to a fault.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,1482,"['Have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'did', ""n't"", 'Triangle', 'really', 'great', 'cast', 'very', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'story', 'around', 'circles', 'point', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'stopping', 'frustration', 'story', 'group', 'friends', 'go', 'sailing', 'boat', 'called', 'Triangle', 'are', 'leaving', 'Florida', 'never', 'mention', 'Bermuda', 'Triangle', 'Everything', 'going', 'well', 'when', 'sudden', 'freak', 'storm', 'capsizing', 'small', 'vessel', 'hang', 'remains', 'boat', 'find', 'cruise', 'ship', 'passing', 'hop', 'dismay', 'find', 'huge', 'ship', 'be', 'empty', 'story', 'here', 'very', 'cleaver', 'original', 'was', 'really', 'film', 'first', 'however', 'Writer/Director', 'Christopher', 'Smith', 'too', 'far', 'making', 'one', 'film', 'really', 'want', 'just', 'be', 'over', 'done', 'Melissa', 'George', 'lead', 'was', 'terrific', 'George', 'performance', 'kept', 'watching', 'movie', 'even', 'had', 'become', 'bored', 'Triangle', 'paired', 'very', 'young', 'Liam', 'Hemsworth', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'role', 'Even', 'young', 'age', '19', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'Acting', 'come', 'natural', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'series', 'expect', 'big', 'things', 'Triangle', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'idea', 'not', 'everybody', 'one', 'weird', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'films', 'line', 'while', 'ultimately', 'too', 'far', 'weird', 'fault']",N/A

1289044,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B002TVQ4GW,trebe,"[12, 14]","Triangle (2009) is a twisted tale of suspense, that is one long strange repetitive ride.  Time and reality become non-linear, as just when it seems that the matter has ended, it begins again at a different juncture.  It's hard to explain, but as the cycle of events repeats, different parts of the story are filled in, eventually leading to a better understanding of some matters, while the overall picture still remains clouded in mystery.  Writer/director Christopher Smith has produced a film with many layers, where some things only become apparent through repeated viewings.A movie where almost nothing is what is seems it be, Triangle has some violence and scares, but is not a horror film.  Jess (Melissa George) is a single mother looking to get away for a weekend cruise aboard her friend Greg's (Michael Dorman) sailboat.  A party of six, leaves Key West aboard the `Triangle', and heads out to sea, where they run into an unexpected storm that capsizes the small craft.  The survivors are floating on the upturned hull, when they happen across a small liner, and manage to board the nearly deserted ship called the Aeolus.Once aboard, the action focuses in on Jess, and very strange things begin to happen, as violence erupts, and people begin to die (or do they?).  Saying more might ruin things for those who have not seen the film, but suffice to say, the story involves cyclical actions, and as the film progresses, it becomes evident that the scope of the cycles involved, is larger than one might initially think.  While some questions are apparently answered, other questions are raised, and much continues to be confusing and ambiguous.There are good performances by everyone involved, particularly Rachael Carpani, but this film is clearly a showcase for Melissa George, who is onscreen most of the time, once the survivors board the Aeolus.  Jess is faced with a cruelly twisted reality, that is almost impossible to comprehend.  On a strange, highly tense journey, she finds herself doing things she would never have thought possible.  Not everything makes sense, and there are questions left unanswered.  While not a masterpiece, Triangle connects enough dots to constitute a compelling, provocative, and very watchable thriller.For such a deep and complex effort, a commentary by Christopher Smith would certainly have been most enlightening, but disappointingly there are no major extras in this edition, just some brief interviews.",4,more circular than triangular . . .,1281571200,"08 12, 2010",2010,2457,"['Triangle', '2009', 'twisted', 'tale', 'suspense', 'one', 'long', 'strange', 'repetitive', 'ride', 'Time', 'reality', 'become', 'non-linear', 'just', 'when', 'matter', 'ended', 'again', 'different', 'juncture', 'hard', 'explain', 'cycle', 'events', 'repeats', 'different', 'parts', 'story', 'are', 'filled', 'eventually', 'leading', 'better', 'understanding', 'matters', 'overall', 'picture', 'still', 'clouded', 'mystery', 'Writer/director', 'Christopher', 'Smith', 'produced', 'film', 'many', 'layers', 'where', 'things', 'only', 'become', 'apparent', 'repeated', 'viewings.A', 'movie', 'where', 'almost', 'nothing', 'what', 'be', 'Triangle', 'violence', 'scares', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'Jess', 'Melissa', 'George', 'single', 'mother', 'looking', 'get', 'away', 'weekend', 'cruise', 'friend', 'Greg', 'Michael', 'Dorman', 'sailboat', 'A', 'party', 'six', 'Key', 'West', 'Triangle', 'out', 'sea', 'where', 'run', 'unexpected', 'storm', 'small', 'craft', 'survivors', 'are', 'floating', 'upturned', 'hull', 'when', 'happen', 'small', 'liner', 'manage', 'board', 'nearly', 'deserted', 'ship', 'called', 'Aeolus.Once', 'aboard', 'action', 'Jess', 'very', 'strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'violence', 'erupts', 'people', 'begin', 'die', 'do', 'Saying', 'more', 'might', 'ruin', 'things', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'suffice', 'say', 'story', 'cyclical', 'actions', 'film', 'evident', 'scope', 'cycles', 'involved', 'larger', 'one', 'might', 'initially', 'think', 'questions', 'are', 'apparently', 'answered', 'other', 'questions', 'are', 'raised', 'much', 'be', 'confusing', 'ambiguous.There', 'are', 'good', 'performances', 'everyone', 'involved', 'particularly', 'Rachael', 'Carpani', 'film', 'clearly', 'showcase', 'Melissa', 'George', 'who', 'onscreen', 'most', 'time', 'once', 'survivors', 'board', 'Aeolus', 'Jess', 'faced', 'cruelly', 'twisted', 'reality', 'almost', 'impossible', 'comprehend', 'strange', 'highly', 'tense', 'journey', 'doing', 'things', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'thought', 'possible', 'Not', 'everything', 'sense', 'are', 'questions', 'left', 'unanswered', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'Triangle', 'enough', 'dots', 'constitute', 'compelling', 'provocative', 'very', 'watchable', 'thriller.For', 'deep', 'complex', 'effort', 'commentary', 'Christopher', 'Smith', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'enlightening', 'disappointingly', 'are', 'major', 'extras', 'edition', 'just', 'brief', 'interviews']",N/A
