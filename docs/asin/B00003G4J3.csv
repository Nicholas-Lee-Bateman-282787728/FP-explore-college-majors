544986,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,B00003G4J3,darragh o'donoghue,"[25, 32]","'Bandit Queen' is an arthouse update of the old 70s exploitation movies, in which a relentless focus on female suffering is justified by a pseudo-feminist revenge-plot.  Taking us far away from the multi-coloured, song-and-dance Hindi spectaculars that are currently all the global range, Shekhar Kapur shows us an India riven by violence, poverty and a vicious caste system, where women are treated as subhuman.  Before she even hits puberty, Phoolan Devi is married off to an older man (dowry: rusty bicycle and old goat) and raped when she expresses dissatisfaction at her social lot.  When, some years later, she is nearly raped again by the landowner's son, it is she who is expelled from the community; she takes up with bandits and begins her first true love affair with the atypically sensitive Vikram, de facto leader while Babu Gujjar is in prison.  When the latter is released, now turned police informer, he resents the pretensions of this lower-caste woman (called a goddess by her followers), has her gang-raped by all his men, and publicly stripped and humiliated.  Having plumbed the lowest depths there are, Devi takes the blood-spattered road of vengeance, turning torture and massacre into a media-fuelled spectacle.When the director of 'Queen' later went on to make a film about Tudor-era royal conspiracies ('Elizabeth'), many were surprised because of the gaping differences in subject matter, but Kapur imposes his own concerns on the two movies: both feature outsider-women attempting to assert power in rigid male-dominated hierarchies; both emphasise the importance of costume, ritual and public spectacle in these societies, and the necessary reuninciation of sexuality and 'normal' femininity of strong women.  In both, the apparently immovable class system represented in heavy buildings and landscape is made fluid and unstable by Kapur's gliding camerawork that seems to make walls melt away.But whereas 'Elizabeth' was an artistic success, 'Queen' seems to me a manipulative failure.  This is mostly due to its reliance on a single source, the prison diaries of Devi, whereas the latter film created a web of conflicting viewpoints and omnipresent sense of surveillance.  It is of course right to expose the atrocities embedded in the Indian caste system, and the slavery of women; it is right that a woman denied a voice in her own country (where the film was banned) should be heard.  But the catalogue of unspeakable crimes inflicted on Devi has the effect of caricaturing the villains around her, turning her very real plight almost into a cartoon of repetitive violence.  There is no nuance of social analysis here; instead the most simplistic behaviouralism  - if such-and-such is inflicted on you, you will respond thus - depoliticising Devi's very real social transgression, reducing her to a mere melodramatic heroine, the 'woman wronged'.  Having stayed so closely with its heroine and her experiences of abuse, when the film has to distance itself from her violence (which it must to avoid endorsing eye-for-an-eye brutality), it feels like a betrayal.  By lingering on her suffering rather than her revenge, the latter is as abrupt, arbitrary and dreamlike as 'Lawrence Of Arabia', the vile murders shot with the same kind of exquisite taste and fussy staging, the political wholly subsumed to the deranged personal.  I always get a bit queasy when men direct these kind of pseudo-feminist pictures - more interested in her body than her voice, 'Queen' can only continues the dehumanisation of its so-called heroine.",4,Almost unwatchable.,1021939200,"05 21, 2002",2002,3560,"['Queen', 'arthouse', 'update', 'old', '70s', 'exploitation', 'movies', 'relentless', 'focus', 'female', 'suffering', 'justified', 'pseudo-feminist', 'revenge-plot', 'Taking', 'far', 'away', 'multi-coloured', 'song-and-dance', 'Hindi', 'spectaculars', 'are', 'currently', 'global', 'range', 'Shekhar', 'Kapur', 'India', 'riven', 'violence', 'poverty', 'vicious', 'caste', 'system', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'treated', 'subhuman', 'even', 'puberty', 'Phoolan', 'Devi', 'married', 'off', 'older', 'man', 'dowry', 'rusty', 'bicycle', 'old', 'goat', 'raped', 'when', 'dissatisfaction', 'social', 'lot', 'When', 'years', 'later', 'nearly', 'raped', 'again', 'landowner', 'son', 'who', 'expelled', 'community', 'up', 'bandits', 'first', 'true', 'love', 'affair', 'atypically', 'sensitive', 'Vikram', 'de', 'facto', 'leader', 'Babu', 'Gujjar', 'prison', 'When', 'latter', 'released', 'now', 'turned', 'police', 'informer', 'pretensions', 'lower-caste', 'woman', 'called', 'goddess', 'followers', 'gang-raped', 'men', 'publicly', 'stripped', 'humiliated', 'Having', 'plumbed', 'lowest', 'depths', 'are', 'Devi', 'blood-spattered', 'road', 'vengeance', 'turning', 'torture', 'massacre', 'media-fuelled', 'spectacle.When', 'director', ""'Queen"", 'later', 'went', 'make', 'film', 'Tudor-era', 'royal', 'conspiracies', ""'Elizabeth"", 'many', 'were', 'surprised', 'gaping', 'differences', 'subject', 'matter', 'Kapur', 'own', 'concerns', 'two', 'movies', 'feature', 'outsider-women', 'attempting', 'assert', 'power', 'rigid', 'male-dominated', 'hierarchies', 'emphasise', 'importance', 'costume', 'ritual', 'public', 'spectacle', 'societies', 'necessary', 'reuninciation', 'sexuality', ""'normal"", 'femininity', 'strong', 'women', 'apparently', 'immovable', 'class', 'system', 'represented', 'heavy', 'buildings', 'landscape', 'made', 'fluid', 'unstable', 'Kapur', 'gliding', 'camerawork', 'make', 'walls', 'melt', 'away.But', 'whereas', 'was', 'artistic', 'success', 'manipulative', 'failure', 'mostly', 'due', 'reliance', 'single', 'source', 'prison', 'diaries', 'Devi', 'latter', 'film', 'created', 'web', 'conflicting', 'viewpoints', 'omnipresent', 'sense', 'surveillance', 'course', 'right', 'expose', 'atrocities', 'embedded', 'Indian', 'caste', 'system', 'slavery', 'women', 'right', 'woman', 'denied', 'voice', 'own', 'country', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'banned', 'should', 'be', 'heard', 'catalogue', 'unspeakable', 'crimes', 'inflicted', 'Devi', 'effect', 'caricaturing', 'villains', 'turning', 'very', 'real', 'plight', 'almost', 'cartoon', 'repetitive', 'violence', 'nuance', 'social', 'analysis', 'here', 'instead', 'most', 'simplistic', 'behaviouralism', 'such-and-such', 'inflicted', 'will', 'respond', 'thus', 'depoliticising', 'Devi', 'very', 'real', 'social', 'transgression', 'reducing', 'mere', 'melodramatic', 'heroine', ""'woman"", 'wronged', 'Having', 'stayed', 'so', 'closely', 'heroine', 'experiences', 'abuse', 'when', 'film', 'distance', 'violence', 'must', 'avoid', 'endorsing', 'eye-for-an-eye', 'brutality', 'betrayal', 'lingering', 'suffering', 'rather', 'revenge', 'latter', 'abrupt', 'arbitrary', 'dreamlike', ""'Lawrence"", 'Arabia', 'vile', 'murders', 'shot', 'same', 'kind', 'exquisite', 'taste', 'fussy', 'staging', 'political', 'wholly', 'subsumed', 'deranged', 'personal', 'always', 'get', 'bit', 'queasy', 'when', 'men', 'direct', 'kind', 'pseudo-feminist', 'pictures', 'more', 'interested', 'body', 'voice', 'can', 'only', 'dehumanisation', 'so-called', 'heroine']",N/A

Story goes Phoolan Devi a mallah woman (low caste) was born in 1963 (when I was 6 years old), sold at 11 to a 30 year old husband, raped, sent back to her village, refused to have sexual intercourse with high class youths of her village (Thakur), banned again, abducted by bandits, raped again, saved and loved briefly by a mallah bandit of her gang Vikram who was killed when the real chief of the gang, a Thakur, was released from prison. After another mass rape, Phoolan decides to have her own gang and take revenge on those who have wronged her. She seeks them out and vengefully kills also many innocents. The Indian government decides that she has become too popular among the lower caste because of her Robin Hood manners and too ferocious as well and so intimidates her to surrender, which she does among the great acclamation by the people of her province. Phoolan Devi's real story continued and after less than ten years in jail, she was liberated and elected as a Member of the Indian Parlament. She married again and was murdered in 2001, probably by relatives of the Thakur's she had killed during her dacoit days.Kapoor's movie was banned in India, and the real Phoolan Devi contested its many inaccuracies and the director never even tried to contact her while he was filming her story. This last fact was seen as a deep sign of disrespect and justified many criticism that are still ongoing.However, independently from these very important issues, the movie has a deep impact still today on our perception of the condition of women and especially child brides in South Asian countries. It depicts the importance of caste belonging, Indian village culture and the mixture of rebellion and ethnic and traditional values that oppress women in many countries. Through the narration Phoolan Devi's tormented life Kapoor wants to make some points one of which surely is also common to the Elizabethian triology, that woman empowerment must pass through a negation of sexuality.The movie is quite long, has beautiful and important music, is played by Indian actors in a completely Indian setting in the Bollywood tradition, but at the same time it is so crude, depicting violence and sex scenes to fall outside of these schemata. But most of all it grips at you and doesn't let go, it must be watched till the end and maybe seen again.The story stays with you for long time and even though not precise and accurate it does give an idea and the feeling of the extraordinary life o Phoolan Devi.",5,Another aspect of modern India - great biography  of an outstanding woman Phoolan Devi,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,2743,"['have', 'only', 'recently', 'watched', 'movie', 'had', 'thoroughly', 'captivated', 'mesmerized', 'when', 'realized', 'had', 'been', 'directed', 'talented', 'Shekhar', 'Kapoor', 'Elizabethian', 'triology', 'tried', 'tie', 'loose', 'threads', 'together', 'Story', 'Phoolan', 'Devi', 'mallah', 'woman', 'low', 'caste', 'was', 'born', '1963', 'when', 'was', '6', 'years', 'old', 'sold', '11', '30', 'year', 'old', 'husband', 'raped', 'sent', 'back', 'village', 'refused', 'have', 'sexual', 'intercourse', 'high', 'class', 'youths', 'village', 'Thakur', 'banned', 'again', 'abducted', 'bandits', 'raped', 'again', 'saved', 'loved', 'briefly', 'mallah', 'bandit', 'gang', 'Vikram', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'when', 'real', 'chief', 'gang', 'Thakur', 'was', 'released', 'prison', 'mass', 'rape', 'Phoolan', 'have', 'own', 'gang', 'take', 'revenge', 'who', 'have', 'wronged', 'out', 'vengefully', 'kills', 'also', 'many', 'innocents', 'Indian', 'government', 'decides', 'become', 'too', 'popular', 'lower', 'caste', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'manners', 'too', 'ferocious', 'well', 'so', 'surrender', 'great', 'acclamation', 'people', 'province', 'Phoolan', 'Devi', 'real', 'story', 'continued', 'less', 'ten', 'years', 'jail', 'was', 'liberated', 'elected', 'Member', 'Indian', 'Parlament', 'married', 'again', 'was', 'murdered', '2001', 'probably', 'relatives', 'Thakur', 'had', 'killed', 'dacoit', 'days.Kapoor', 'movie', 'was', 'banned', 'India', 'real', 'Phoolan', 'Devi', 'contested', 'many', 'inaccuracies', 'director', 'never', 'even', 'tried', 'contact', 'was', 'filming', 'story', 'last', 'fact', 'was', 'seen', 'deep', 'sign', 'disrespect', 'justified', 'many', 'criticism', 'are', 'still', 'ongoing.However', 'independently', 'very', 'important', 'issues', 'movie', 'deep', 'impact', 'still', 'today', 'perception', 'condition', 'women', 'especially', 'child', 'brides', 'South', 'Asian', 'countries', 'importance', 'caste', 'belonging', 'Indian', 'village', 'culture', 'mixture', 'rebellion', 'ethnic', 'traditional', 'values', 'oppress', 'women', 'many', 'countries', 'narration', 'Phoolan', 'Devi', 'tormented', 'life', 'Kapoor', 'make', 'points', 'one', 'surely', 'also', 'common', 'Elizabethian', 'triology', 'woman', 'empowerment', 'must', 'pass', 'negation', 'sexuality.The', 'movie', 'quite', 'long', 'beautiful', 'important', 'music', 'played', 'Indian', 'actors', 'completely', 'Indian', 'setting', 'Bollywood', 'tradition', 'same', 'time', 'so', 'crude', 'depicting', 'violence', 'sex', 'scenes', 'fall', 'schemata', 'most', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'must', 'be', 'watched', 'end', 'maybe', 'seen', 'again.The', 'story', 'stays', 'long', 'time', 'even', 'not', 'precise', 'accurate', 'give', 'idea', 'feeling', 'extraordinary', 'life', 'o', 'Phoolan', 'Devi']",N/A

Looking at the cruelty and poor living conditions, compounded by a terrible caste system one wonders how India is better off today than under the old British Raj!  The British soldiers always sympathized with the ill treatment of Hindi women, and often they took arbitrary revenge on Hindi males when they observed this kind of behavior.  Other charming practices that the Raj curbed was Sutee.  This was where a widow would burn herself before her entire family after her husband had died.This film, while no doubt over done with excessive violence and rape, paints a frightening portrait of modern India.  Looking at this work one wonders how India is expected to become such an economic powerhouse in this century.  No doubt 1/3 of the country will live off the other 2/3 who will continue to live more or less as shown here.  The fate of women as shown here in Hindi India is not much different than what we find in most of Islam today.  Is it surprising that so many women in 3rd world countries want to escape to the West and America.  After seeing this film I can understand their plight.

This is a brilliant production based on the real life story of an Indian legend, Phoolan Devi (Goddess Phoolan). This movie will give you a sense of what *most* of India is really like. The villages, the people, the living conditions, the caste system, the corruption.Phoolan Devi (Goddess Phoolan) is a flawed woman. Not because of her caste (low), or her tenacity (high), or her unfortunate life (extreme) but because she is human (like the rest of us). Her life is a rough lot, but she doesn't overcome with nobility or ""working to change the system"". She gets a gang of highwaymen and starts slaughtering all who represent her oppression (the oppression of the low caste women) and in the process becomes an unwitting heroine of the people. The men that used her, raped her, beat her, sullied her honor, and those that oppose her liberty, dignity and inherent worth as a female human being... either suffered her gun, her fist or those of her fellow outlaws. A Robin-hood story for India. The director (the versatile and brilliant Shekar Kapur) has made sure that you don't *always* feel pity for Phoolan, she is more than the sum of her victimizations. She is portrayed as strong, sassy, stubborn, flawed, struggling, striving to live, to heal, to love, to avenge. Each step of the way, she perservered and did what no one thought could be done.The gripe I have with this movie is that the director, never bothered to meet/consult with Phoolan (who was alive when the movie was made). This movie is not considered a definitive account of her life or a representation of the book (Phoolan's diary). It was not endorsed or approved by Phoolan in any way.For those wondering, Phoolan was truly a people's hero, eventually released from jail, elected to the Indian Parliment and then promptly/tragically assasinated a couple years ago.
