As adults we see kids argue, and we tell them to kiss and make up.That does not apply to adults though, pretty immature how adults can hand out advice but they dont take advice, or practice what they preach. Thats precisely what I got out of this movie.I thought the point of this movie was well pointed out and well scripted into a beautiful movie.",5,Precious,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,389,"['What', 'sweet', 'movie', 'precious', 'plot', 'adults', 'see', 'kids', 'argue', 'tell', 'kiss', 'make', 'up.That', 'not', 'apply', 'adults', 'pretty', 'immature', 'how', 'adults', 'can', 'hand', 'out', 'advice', 'dont', 'take', 'advice', 'practice', 'what', 'preach', 'Thats', 'precisely', 'what', 'got', 'out', 'movie.I', 'thought', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'pointed', 'out', 'well', 'scripted', 'beautiful', 'movie']",Trinity Goodheart

She is such a sweet young lady and is always making little angels to put in her friend's store.  Trinity lives alone with her dad.  Mom was white and dad is black, so there was some family friction.  Now, Mom is gone and nobody is speaking to nobody!  An angel visits Trinity with half a locket, encouraging her to find the other half, and reconnect her family. So, she sets out to try.",5,See -- I told you angels are real!,1347062400,"09 8, 2012",2012,484,"['was', 'just', 'such', 'nice', 'little', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'Bi-racial', 'Trinity', 'age', '12', 'angels', 'such', 'sweet', 'young', 'lady', 'always', 'making', 'little', 'angels', 'put', 'friend', 'store', 'Trinity', 'alone', 'dad', 'Mom', 'was', 'white', 'dad', 'black', 'was', 'family', 'friction', 'Now', 'Mom', 'gone', 'nobody', 'speaking', 'nobody', 'angel', 'visits', 'Trinity', 'locket', 'encouraging', 'find', 'other', 'half', 'reconnect', 'family', 'So', 'out', 'try']",Trinity Goodheart

This is a movie of battle and struggles, and how it can take years to get past the past or to atleast accept things you can not change. How this little girl change the thoughts and lives of four adults was powerful. I need to order another copy because my daughter step on it but I will buy it again.
