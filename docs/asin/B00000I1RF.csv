501981,AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L,B00000I1RF,"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip""","[41, 43]","That's not only a theme of this movie, it's part of the lyrics that self-proclaimed (and with good reason)&quot;super-masochist&quot; Bob Flanagan cheerfully sings at a lecture/performance-he did a pretty witty re-working of the &quot;Supercalafraga...&quot;etc song from Mary Poppins. Did I mention he's wearing a little costume including a cape when he performs it?Yep, Bob Flanagan had a pretty good sense of humor. That was one of the pleasant surprises of this movie. When I first heard about this movie, all I heard about was the hammer scene. I also had skimmed the RE-search book, and looking at some of the really extreme mutilations to areas of his body I would rather not name, I actually figured he was slightly disturbed. I'm pretty liberal and am of the opinion that what 2 consenting adults do, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else against their will, is their own business. I thought, because of his CF combined with this serious torture that he either was suicidal or hated himself. I also wondered about his relationship with his dominant/lover/partner of 15 years, Sheree Rose, hoping that it was loving and she wasn't just using him.I was glad that this movie proved my pre-conceived notions wrong. This is a very intelligent, sane, witty, talented, likeable, and above all, VERY brave guy who happened to enjoy being beaten and tortured sexually. The movie explains-without preaching- that he actually gained strength from his activities. (according to statistics, most CF sufferers die in their 20's. He lived till his early 40's (actually a record)and says his sex life kept him going. He figured for one thing, he had nothing to lose. For another thing, CF is a very painful disease, and he chose to use S&amp;M as a way to take control of his pain and disease. If you find this a hard idea to understand, or are curious, I highly recommend this movie. This has been said before, but I don't recommend it if you're squeamish. I'm jaded, but I had to look away a few times. Interestingly enough, what I found harder to watch than the notorious Hammer of Love was seeing BF racked with pain, coughing his lungs out, and (I don't think I'm spoiling anything here as the movie opens with Bob good-naturedly writing his own obituary) finally losing his battle with CF.I also didn't think this movie would be so touching. Before the end, I realized he had a very loving relationship with Sheree. Not only are they sexually a perfect match, she is his best friend, soulmate, and care-giver, which is no mean feat. Face it, if you don't love someone, you're not going to be sticking around and helping them expel mucus from their lungs on a regular basis. When he starts losing his fight and finally goes to the hospital to die, the scenes of them together, with her gently telling him it's OK to leave her, are some of the most heart-breaking I've ever seen. This is one brave woman. Also, when she's not in her S&amp;M gear, she could easily pass for an kindly elementary school teacher. It's a great contrast to see her tying him up and sticking needles in his groin in one scene, and later to see her rocking and knitting peacefully in another. I was also haunted by the scenes of him dying, the way he looked, and what he said, things that I've heard are very common last words such as, &quot;I never thought this would really happen...this is so weird.&quot;Is this a hard movie to watch? Even if graphic depictions of *very* sensitive areas of the body being nailed, pounded, and pierced don't faze you, I cannot imagine anyone who wouldn't be shaken or at least moved watching the later scenes of this man really, literally dying in front of the camera and your eyes. But I'm glad I saw it. My husband, however, loves documentaries, and even talked about seeing the movie when it was in limited release. I made the mistake of telling him about one of the little demonstrations, and now he refuses to see it, no matter how good it is (and he's sat through some pretty nasty stuff). If you're brave and feeling up to it,  though, I highly recommend this movie. If you're easily (or even not-so-easily) grossed-out, but have an interest in the life and death of this man, then just cover your eyes during the graphic parts. And when you hear &quot;Hammer of Love&quot; start playing, you may want to leave the room for a minute or two.",5,&quot;His CS Woulda Killed him If it Weren't For S&amp;M!&quot;,976838400,"12 15, 2000",2000,4358,"['not', 'only', 'theme', 'movie', 'part', 'lyrics', 'self-proclaimed', 'good', 'reason', 'super-masochist', 'quot', 'Bob', 'Flanagan', 'cheerfully', 'lecture/performance-he', 'did', 'pretty', 'witty', 're-working', 'quot', 'Supercalafraga', 'quot', 'song', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Did', 'mention', 'wearing', 'little', 'costume', 'including', 'cape', 'when', 'Yep', 'Bob', 'Flanagan', 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'was', 'one', 'pleasant', 'surprises', 'movie', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'heard', 'was', 'hammer', 'scene', 'also', 'had', 'skimmed', 'RE-search', 'book', 'looking', 'really', 'extreme', 'mutilations', 'areas', 'body', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'name', 'actually', 'figured', 'was', 'slightly', 'disturbed', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'liberal', 'am', 'opinion', 'what', '2', 'consenting', 'adults', 'do', 'as', 'long', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'anyone', 'else', 'will', 'own', 'business', 'thought', 'CF', 'combined', 'serious', 'torture', 'was', 'suicidal', 'hated', 'also', 'wondered', 'relationship', 'dominant/lover/partner', '15', 'years', 'Sheree', 'Rose', 'hoping', 'was', 'loving', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'using', 'him.I', 'was', 'glad', 'movie', 'proved', 'pre-conceived', 'notions', 'wrong', 'very', 'intelligent', 'sane', 'witty', 'talented', 'likeable', 'VERY', 'brave', 'guy', 'who', 'happened', 'enjoy', 'being', 'beaten', 'tortured', 'sexually', 'movie', 'explains-without', 'preaching-', 'actually', 'gained', 'strength', 'activities', 'according', 'statistics', 'most', 'CF', 'sufferers', 'die', '20', 'lived', 'till', 'early', '40', 'actually', 'record', 'sex', 'life', 'kept', 'going', 'figured', 'one', 'thing', 'had', 'nothing', 'lose', 'thing', 'CF', 'very', 'painful', 'disease', 'chose', 'use', 'S', 'amp', 'M', 'way', 'take', 'control', 'pain', 'disease', 'find', 'hard', 'idea', 'understand', 'are', 'curious', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'been', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', ""'re"", 'squeamish', ""'m"", 'jaded', 'had', 'look', 'away', 'few', 'times', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'what', 'found', 'harder', 'watch', 'notorious', 'Hammer', 'Love', 'was', 'seeing', 'BF', 'racked', 'pain', 'coughing', 'lungs', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'spoiling', 'anything', 'here', 'movie', 'Bob', 'good-naturedly', 'writing', 'own', 'obituary', 'finally', 'losing', 'battle', 'CF.I', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'touching', 'end', 'realized', 'had', 'very', 'loving', 'relationship', 'Sheree', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'sexually', 'perfect', 'match', 'best', 'friend', 'soulmate', 'care-giver', 'mean', 'feat', 'Face', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'someone', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'be', 'sticking', 'around', 'helping', 'expel', 'mucus', 'lungs', 'regular', 'basis', 'When', 'losing', 'fight', 'finally', 'hospital', 'die', 'scenes', 'together', 'gently', 'telling', 'OK', 'leave', 'are', 'most', 'heart-breaking', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'brave', 'woman', 'Also', 'when', 'not', 'S', 'amp', 'M', 'gear', 'could', 'easily', 'pass', 'kindly', 'elementary', 'school', 'teacher', 'great', 'contrast', 'see', 'tying', 'up', 'sticking', 'needles', 'groin', 'one', 'scene', 'later', 'see', 'rocking', 'knitting', 'peacefully', 'was', 'also', 'haunted', 'scenes', 'dying', 'way', 'looked', 'what', 'said', 'things', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'are', 'very', 'common', 'last', 'words', 'such', 'quot', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'really', 'happen', 'so', 'weird.', 'quot', 'hard', 'movie', 'watch', 'Even', 'graphic', 'depictions', '*very*', 'sensitive', 'areas', 'body', 'being', 'nailed', 'pounded', 'pierced', 'do', ""n't"", 'faze', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'shaken', 'least', 'moved', 'watching', 'later', 'scenes', 'man', 'really', 'literally', 'dying', 'front', 'camera', 'eyes', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', 'My', 'husband', 'however', 'documentaries', 'even', 'talked', 'seeing', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'limited', 'release', 'made', 'mistake', 'telling', 'one', 'little', 'demonstrations', 'now', 'see', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'sat', 'pretty', 'nasty', 'stuff', ""'re"", 'brave', 'feeling', 'up', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', ""'re"", 'easily', 'even', 'not-so-easily', 'grossed-out', 'have', 'interest', 'life', 'death', 'man', 'then', 'just', 'cover', 'eyes', 'graphic', 'parts', 'when', 'hear', 'quot', 'Hammer', 'Love', 'quot', 'playing', 'may', 'want', 'leave', 'room', 'minute', 'two']",Sick VHS

501983,AWPODHOB4GFWL,B00000I1RF,"Martin A Hogan ""Marty From SF""","[20, 20]","It takes a certain kind of brave and twisted person to turn his life and body into an S & M performance piece.  Bob Flanagan is both sick and brilliant.  Flanagan survived cystic fibrosis until the age of forty-two - a very long time.  He attributes this to constantly inflicting pain on himself relentlessly over the years.  His dominatrix partner Sheree, helps him with is goals.  The various scenes are sometimes spliced with dark humor and other times simply shown in their bleak gruesomeness.  There is nothing that Bob and Sheree have not done to him to inflict pain in the most disgusting ways possible.  It's an entirely different world and it takes a strong stomach to watch.  Bob specializes in abusing his penis in ways unimaginable, including a scene with a hammer, a nail and a board - there is blood.  The most amazing part of this documentary is when Bob and Sheree take this `performance art' to various museums in New York and Los Angeles.  Bob allows himself to be raised by his feet, pierced, shackled and naked, high above the museum goers heads.  It is disturbing.  If you have an interest in the S & M/bondage world, you might find this interesting, but the scenes are so graphic and sometimes overwhelming in their intensity, it can be hard to stomach.

(Joaquin Phoenix in 8MM.) Just going to show that even an awful film can have a moment of scripting genius. Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist, contains one of those things. Even if I never see it again, there's a particular scene in this film that will haunt me to my deathbed. It's not just the incredible act that's performed (and if you haven't seen the movie yet, when you stumble upon the scene in question, you will know it), but the way director Kirby [director's name censored for Amazon consumption] puts everything together: the film footage, the incredibly inappropriate music, the foreshadowing. (Flanagan mentions the scene in a few of his monologues earlier in the movie.) This is the third of Kirby [director's name censored for Amazon consumption]'s films I've seen, and the earliest of the three; I expected no less.[director's name censored for Amazon consumption] here profiles Bob Flanagan, one of the longest-lived sufferers of cystic fibrosis. Flanagan handled his disease by controlling his body the only way he could: through masochism. We alternate scenes from various performance videos with interviews featuring, for the most part, Flanagan and his longtime partner/dominatrix, Sheree Rose. (About two thirds of the way through the film, a third major player enters the picture: Sarah Doucette, a Canadian sufferer of cystic fibrosis who meets Flanagan through the Make-a-Wish Foundation.) While it's tempting to see Flanagan solely through the lens of his being a masochist or a performance artist or whatever single facet of his personality one might find the most interesting (or vile, judging by some reactions to the movie), Kirby [director's name censored for Amazon consumption] presents a complex, hopelessly optimistic guy who's just getting by the best he can, until, as the title of the film warns us, he can't any more. Those final moments are touching in a way I can't explain; once again, [director's name censored for Amazon consumption] manages to put everything together (everything that happens after Flanagan's death is chronicled not by [director's name censored for Amazon consumption]'s filmmaking, but by photos Rose shot at the hospital and the morgue) in the most powerful way possible.Fantastic, pure and simple. ****",4,Surprisingly touching.,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,2571,"['Sick', 'Life', 'Death', 'Bob', 'Flanagan', 'Supermasochist', 'Kirby', '[', 'director', 'name', 'censored', 'Amazon', 'consumption', ']', '1997', 'One', 'least', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'line', 'often', 'quote', 'are', 'things', 'see', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'unsee', 'know', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', '8MM', 'Just', 'going', 'show', 'even', 'awful', 'film', 'can', 'have', 'moment', 'scripting', 'genius', 'Sick', 'Life', 'Death', 'Bob', 'Flanagan', 'Supermasochist', 'one', 'things', 'Even', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'particular', 'scene', 'film', 'will', 'haunt', 'deathbed', 'not', 'just', 'incredible', 'act', 'performed', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', 'when', 'stumble', 'scene', 'question', 'will', 'know', 'way', 'director', 'Kirby', '[', 'director', 'name', 'censored', 'Amazon', 'consumption', ']', 'everything', 'together', 'film', 'footage', 'incredibly', 'inappropriate', 'music', 'foreshadowing', 'Flanagan', 'mentions', 'scene', 'few', 'monologues', 'earlier', 'movie', 'third', 'Kirby', '[', 'director', 'name', 'censored', 'Amazon', 'consumption', ']', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'earliest', 'three', 'expected', 'less', '[', 'director', 'name', 'censored', 'Amazon', 'consumption', ']', 'here', 'Bob', 'Flanagan', 'one', 'longest-lived', 'sufferers', 'cystic', 'fibrosis', 'Flanagan', 'handled', 'disease', 'controlling', 'body', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'masochism', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'various', 'performance', 'videos', 'interviews', 'featuring', 'most', 'part', 'Flanagan', 'longtime', 'partner/dominatrix', 'Sheree', 'Rose', 'two', 'thirds', 'way', 'film', 'third', 'major', 'player', 'picture', 'Sarah', 'Doucette', 'Canadian', 'sufferer', 'cystic', 'fibrosis', 'who', 'Flanagan', 'Make-a-Wish', 'Foundation', 'tempting', 'see', 'Flanagan', 'solely', 'lens', 'being', 'masochist', 'performance', 'artist', 'single', 'facet', 'personality', 'one', 'might', 'find', 'most', 'interesting', 'vile', 'judging', 'reactions', 'movie', 'Kirby', '[', 'director', 'name', 'censored', 'Amazon', 'consumption', ']', 'complex', 'hopelessly', 'optimistic', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'getting', 'best', 'can', 'title', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'more', 'final', 'moments', 'are', 'touching', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'once', 'again', '[', 'director', 'name', 'censored', 'Amazon', 'consumption', ']', 'put', 'everything', 'together', 'everything', 'Flanagan', 'death', 'chronicled', 'not', '[', 'director', 'name', 'censored', 'Amazon', 'consumption', ']', 'filmmaking', 'photos', 'Rose', 'shot', 'hospital', 'morgue', 'most', 'powerful', 'way', 'possible.Fantastic', 'pure', 'simple', '****']",Sick VHS
