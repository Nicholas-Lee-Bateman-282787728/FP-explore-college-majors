1072217,A28GRFVAA4DU5P,B000PMFRUG,A Texas reviewer,"[20, 21]","I haven't seen this movie since it was first released in the early '90's but I still remember the strong reaction I had to what the survivor's of the USS Indianapolis endured after their ship was sunk in the last part of WWII. I don't want to get into the details so that I don't ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie. However, I will say that even after all these years I still remember the excellent acting of the cast, of whom the most memorable for me were Stacy Keach, Richard Thomas, and David Caruso.UPDATE 8/2/07I received my dvd yesterday and can now tell you about the quality of the transfer. The picture quality is not bad, it is not HD quality but I didn't notice any problems like graininess, or scratches, or anything like that. It is not any better or worse than a typical cable broadcast program. The sound is also about average, so don't expect to get blown out of your seat.The story is a very powerful one that once you see it you won't be likely to forget it.UPDATEIf You have Amazon prime then you can watch this for free on Amazon instant videos.

There was no definate story to follow, the acting and dialogue were mediocre at best and very little realism in what few special affects there were.

Stacey Keach as Captain McVay was laughable - he gave a better performance as SGT stedangco in Up in Smoke.  I have just just read ""In Harm's Way"" by Doug Stanton and that painted a clear picture of the Tragedy and heroism of the USS Indy and I highly recommend this book.
