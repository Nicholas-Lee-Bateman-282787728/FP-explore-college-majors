335298,A2983KT3N8FGM0,630279756X,Calder,"[2, 2]","This film was a problematic endeavor based on the far superior book.  For whatever reason - perhaps because of the misguided criticism (it was a work of fiction after all) the author was taking from some academics - the Hopis and Navajos of Martin Cruz Smith's book were changed to fictional Nation names for the film.  This somewhat undermines the audience's connection between the movie's characters and their Southwest surroundings right from the start.  Worse, however, was the decision to cast actors of European/American descent to play several roles that could have gone to American Indian actors.  For some reason this is still occasionally done with indigenous characters, and it remains a bizarre mistake.  While Stephen Macht and Nick Mancuso turned in fine performances, actual indigenous actors would have been much more appropriate. . .even casting unknowns.  David Warner also did ok, but some of his dialogue was amped up too much for the film and created a character that is occasionally over the top.  The early meeting with Youngman in the Hogan seemed particularly poorly executed and needlessly changed from the dialogue of the book.  Many scenes also feel rushed.The bat effects in the film are well known and not for their strengths.  Carlo Rambaldi had a solid reputation at the time he was chosen to helm the effects for this film, but for whatever reason he dropped the ball entirely in this picture.  The effects range from mediocre to bad, even for the time.  The film came out when critics were chomping at the bit to tear up anything reminiscent of ""Jaws"" - so the weak effects provided additional fodder.  On the bright side, Henry Mancini's soundtrack is quite good and atmospheric.  Arthur Hiller's direction, while unlikely to win any awards for the film, was not as bad as some critics claimed.  George Clutesi brought a desperately needed indigenous presence to the film and executed his limited character with talent.  While disappointing, this was still much better than the unrelated, horrendous film ""Bats"" that came out twenty years later.  The ""manufactured on demand"" DVD-R from Amazon is a nice print of Nightwing.  Visually the film looks great on the disc.  My three stars are based on both the visual quality of the DVD-R version and the strong points of the film itself.Very few bad films deserve a second chance, but if you are familiar with the book Nightwing, you are probably aware of that story's untapped potential.  I would like to see this film remade, with an even closer adherence to the storyline while still set in the time it was written, with more indigenous actors in the key roles.  Improved special effects certainly wouldn't hurt.  It isn't likely to happen, but it could prove a lot more interesting than much of the nonsense coming out nowadays.",3,An ultimately dissappointing adaptation of Martin Cruz Smith's excellent book,1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,2813,"['film', 'was', 'problematic', 'endeavor', 'based', 'far', 'superior', 'book', 'reason', 'perhaps', 'misguided', 'criticism', 'was', 'work', 'fiction', 'author', 'was', 'taking', 'academics', 'Hopis', 'Navajos', 'Martin', 'Cruz', 'Smith', 'book', 'were', 'changed', 'fictional', 'Nation', 'names', 'film', 'somewhat', 'audience', 'connection', 'movie', 'characters', 'Southwest', 'surroundings', 'right', 'start', 'Worse', 'however', 'was', 'decision', 'cast', 'actors', 'European/American', 'descent', 'play', 'several', 'roles', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'American', 'Indian', 'actors', 'reason', 'still', 'occasionally', 'done', 'indigenous', 'characters', 'bizarre', 'mistake', 'Stephen', 'Macht', 'Nick', 'Mancuso', 'turned', 'fine', 'performances', 'actual', 'indigenous', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'appropriate', '.even', 'casting', 'unknowns', 'David', 'Warner', 'also', 'did', 'ok', 'dialogue', 'was', 'amped', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'created', 'character', 'occasionally', 'top', 'early', 'meeting', 'Youngman', 'Hogan', 'seemed', 'particularly', 'poorly', 'executed', 'needlessly', 'changed', 'dialogue', 'book', 'Many', 'scenes', 'also', 'feel', 'rushed.The', 'bat', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'not', 'strengths', 'Carlo', 'Rambaldi', 'had', 'solid', 'reputation', 'time', 'was', 'chosen', 'helm', 'effects', 'film', 'reason', 'dropped', 'ball', 'entirely', 'picture', 'effects', 'range', 'mediocre', 'bad', 'even', 'time', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'critics', 'were', 'chomping', 'bit', 'tear', 'up', 'anything', 'reminiscent', 'Jaws', 'weak', 'effects', 'provided', 'additional', 'fodder', 'bright', 'side', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'soundtrack', 'quite', 'good', 'atmospheric', 'Arthur', 'Hiller', 'direction', 'unlikely', 'win', 'awards', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'critics', 'claimed', 'George', 'Clutesi', 'brought', 'desperately', 'needed', 'indigenous', 'presence', 'film', 'executed', 'limited', 'character', 'talent', 'disappointing', 'was', 'still', 'much', 'better', 'unrelated', 'horrendous', 'film', 'Bats', 'came', 'out', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'manufactured', 'demand', 'DVD-R', 'Amazon', 'nice', 'print', 'Nightwing', 'Visually', 'film', 'great', 'disc', 'three', 'stars', 'are', 'based', 'visual', 'quality', 'DVD-R', 'version', 'strong', 'points', 'film', 'itself.Very', 'few', 'bad', 'films', 'deserve', 'second', 'chance', 'are', 'familiar', 'book', 'Nightwing', 'are', 'probably', 'aware', 'story', 'untapped', 'potential', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'film', 'remade', 'even', 'closer', 'adherence', 'storyline', 'still', 'set', 'time', 'was', 'written', 'more', 'indigenous', 'actors', 'key', 'roles', 'Improved', 'special', 'effects', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', ""n't"", 'likely', 'happen', 'could', 'prove', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'much', 'nonsense', 'coming', 'out', 'nowadays']",Nightwing VHS

The sound is a good balance of the melancholy Henry Mancini score, voices and some shrill sound effects in all your TV speakers during the bat attack scenes.

335305,A2NJO6YE954DBH,630279756X,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 10]","The meaning of the title of this 1979 film becomes clear when we learn that an Indian reservation in New Mexico has been invaded by vampire bats.  This situation is complicated by the fact that, in the best tradition of rampant stereotypes, there is oil underneath the tribe's sacred burial grounds and a soulless oil company is out to get it no matter what.  The oil is actually in a cave, which is how we work the bats into the story, because companies drilling for oil rarely hit bats.  Standing in the way of progress, besides all those bat puppets, is Youngman Duran (Nick Mancuso), a reservation cop, who is basically the only person in the film with both brains and ethics.  David Warner is Phillip Payne, the bat expert who shows up to provide the characters and the audience with any and all necessary exposition until the climax, when he comes up with a plan for saving the day because these might be vampire bats, but instead of sucking blood they are spreading Bubonic plague.Based on the novel by Martin Cruz Smith, the script by Steve Shagan and Bud Shrake is fairly faithful to the original story and wants to evince political consciousness, but resorts to stand Hollywood conceptions about what life is like on the reservation, which is most painful when it portrays the debate between those who want to preserve tradition and those who want to build modern things like hospitals.  I remember when ""Nightwing"" was being filmed in New Mexico, mostly up around Laguna Pueblo and the Bonanza Creek Ranch near Santa Fe.  Flavio Martinez, a kid I went to high school with, and who played the part in a forgettable Disney movie that has never been released on video, had a bit part in this film as Isla Laloma.  Directed by Arthur Hiller, ""Nightwing"" also features Kathryn Harrold as the pretty woman who has to be rescued from the bats, Staphen Macht as the Indian who argues for progress, and Strother Martin as a crazy old coot.  However, overall the locations are a lot better than the acting or the special effects.One of the ways ""Nightwing"" harkens back to the good old days of horror movies, besides the rubber bats, is the way they promoted this film.  Consider all the taglines this film had: ""In the dead of night they come - Swift - Silent - Savage,"" ""The day belongs to man.  The night is theirs,"" and ""What do you fear most - the dark - or something that waits in the dark,"" all have this inherent ambiguity that could be referring to the Indians as well as the bats.  But then ""The bats of hell let loose upon the earth"" pretty much gives the game away.  But it always a bad sign when the taglines are better than the movie.  I was going to say that somebody somebody was going to use computers to make a really good horde of monster bats movie, but Louis Morneau tried to do that in the 1999 film ""Bats"" and it is on the AFI's list of ""Bottom 100"" movies.  ""Nightwing"" is slightly better, due almost entirely to Warner's performance, which remains the film's only redeeming quality beyond Kathryn Harrold's looks.",3,A bad plague carrying bats attack Indian reservation movie,1053216000,"05 18, 2003",2003,3039,"['meaning', 'title', '1979', 'film', 'becomes', 'clear', 'when', 'learn', 'Indian', 'reservation', 'New', 'Mexico', 'been', 'invaded', 'vampire', 'bats', 'situation', 'complicated', 'fact', 'best', 'tradition', 'rampant', 'stereotypes', 'oil', 'tribe', 'sacred', 'burial', 'grounds', 'soulless', 'oil', 'company', 'out', 'get', 'matter', 'what', 'oil', 'actually', 'cave', 'how', 'work', 'bats', 'story', 'companies', 'drilling', 'oil', 'rarely', 'hit', 'bats', 'Standing', 'way', 'progress', 'bat', 'puppets', 'Youngman', 'Duran', 'Nick', 'Mancuso', 'reservation', 'cop', 'who', 'basically', 'only', 'person', 'film', 'brains', 'ethics', 'David', 'Warner', 'Phillip', 'Payne', 'bat', 'expert', 'who', 'up', 'provide', 'characters', 'audience', 'necessary', 'exposition', 'climax', 'when', 'up', 'plan', 'saving', 'day', 'might', 'be', 'vampire', 'bats', 'instead', 'sucking', 'blood', 'are', 'spreading', 'Bubonic', 'plague.Based', 'novel', 'Martin', 'Cruz', 'Smith', 'script', 'Steve', 'Shagan', 'Bud', 'Shrake', 'fairly', 'faithful', 'original', 'story', 'evince', 'political', 'consciousness', 'stand', 'Hollywood', 'conceptions', 'what', 'life', 'reservation', 'most', 'painful', 'when', 'debate', 'who', 'want', 'preserve', 'tradition', 'who', 'want', 'build', 'modern', 'things', 'hospitals', 'remember', 'when', 'Nightwing', 'was', 'being', 'filmed', 'New', 'Mexico', 'mostly', 'Laguna', 'Pueblo', 'Bonanza', 'Creek', 'Ranch', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'Flavio', 'Martinez', 'kid', 'went', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'played', 'part', 'forgettable', 'Disney', 'movie', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'video', 'had', 'bit', 'part', 'film', 'Isla', 'Laloma', 'Directed', 'Arthur', 'Hiller', 'Nightwing', 'also', 'Kathryn', 'Harrold', 'pretty', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'rescued', 'bats', 'Staphen', 'Macht', 'Indian', 'who', 'progress', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'crazy', 'old', 'coot', 'However', 'overall', 'locations', 'are', 'lot', 'better', 'acting', 'special', 'effects.One', 'ways', 'Nightwing', 'back', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'horror', 'movies', 'rubber', 'bats', 'way', 'promoted', 'film', 'Consider', 'taglines', 'film', 'had', 'dead', 'night', 'come', 'Swift', 'Silent', 'Savage', 'day', 'man', 'night', 'What', 'do', 'fear', 'most', 'dark', 'something', 'dark', 'have', 'inherent', 'ambiguity', 'could', 'be', 'referring', 'Indians', 'as', 'well', 'bats', 'then', 'bats', 'hell', 'let', 'loose', 'earth', 'pretty', 'much', 'game', 'away', 'always', 'bad', 'sign', 'when', 'taglines', 'are', 'better', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'say', 'somebody', 'somebody', 'was', 'going', 'use', 'computers', 'make', 'really', 'good', 'horde', 'monster', 'bats', 'movie', 'Louis', 'Morneau', 'tried', 'do', '1999', 'film', 'Bats', 'AFI', 'list', 'Bottom', '100', 'movies', 'Nightwing', 'slightly', 'better', 'due', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Warner', 'performance', 'film', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'Kathryn', 'Harrold', 'looks']",Nightwing VHS

Curtis ""Dr. Zaius""","[0, 0]","Growing up in the late seventies I was a huge fan of many of the thrillers that were modeled in a sense after the classic ""Jaws"".  Out of the many I saw (Orca:  The Killer Whale"", ""Alligator"" among others.) ""Nightwing"" was my favorite.  I enjoyed it so much that it's flaws do not take away from it's enjoyment and overall appeal.  I was happy to hear the movie was finally available on DVD through Amazon.The DVD is a very simple one.  There is no chapter selection (Though you will be able to skip to chapters as the movie plays.) and the only special feature is the movie trailer.  It would have been nice to have a commentary from the cast and/or director, but the DVD is of very good quality regardless.Youngman Duran is a Maskai indian who lives on the tribe's reservation and works as a police officer.  The man who has raised him since the death of his parents is a tribal priest named Abner.  Duran greatly admires Abner but worries about Abner's sanity.  One day on a visit to him, Abner tells Duran that he will call upon the indian god Yehwah to ""end the world.""  The next day Duran finds Abner dead under mysterious circumstances.  Shortly thereafter the reservation is plagued by a huge swarm of vampire bats who launch devestating attacks at night.A great reason for the movie's appeal is it's cast.  Despite instances of cornball dialogue, the main actors actually do well in their respective roles.  They did not deserve to win Oscars, but on the other hand they did not deserve to win Razzies either.  The standout is David Warner as scientist Phillip Payne.  Warner has had a long distinguished carrer in movies (""Tron"", ""Star Trek VI:  The Undiscovered Country"", ""Titanic"") and television (""Star Trek:  The Next Genaration"" ""A Christmas Carol"") and has never given a bad performance in anything I have seen.  His performance in ""Nightwing"" as a man on a mission to hunt down and destroy vampire bats is no exception.  Warner's over the top speech to Duran as to why he is so passionate about killing vampire bats is a little too much but still enjoyable.  Seeing Payne at work as he searches for the bats works well also.  Another strong point is Nick Mancuso as Youngman Duran.  Despite being Italian he is very believable in his role as a Maskai indian.  There are times when his dialogue is a bit silly, but those moments are few and far between.  Kathryn Harrold stars as Duran's love interest.  She is the weakest character in the film but she gives as good a performance as the script will allow.The scene where the bats make their first appearance in the movie actually works quite well despite the fact that the special effects are not quite first rate.  I have seen the movie a number of times and the movie still scares from time to time.  The final showdown with the bats is not perfect but still is quite thrilling and gives the movie a satisfying conclusion.""Nightwing"" does have it's problems but is still very good entertainment and, I believe at least, has stood the test of time.",5,A Very Appealing Movie Despite its Flaws,1334880000,"04 20, 2012",2012,3016,"['Growing', 'up', 'late', 'seventies', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'many', 'thrillers', 'were', 'modeled', 'sense', 'classic', 'Jaws', 'many', 'saw', 'Orca', 'Killer', 'Whale', 'Alligator', 'others', 'Nightwing', 'was', 'favorite', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'flaws', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'enjoyment', 'overall', 'appeal', 'was', 'happy', 'hear', 'movie', 'was', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'Amazon.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'simple', 'one', 'chapter', 'selection', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'skip', 'chapters', 'movie', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'movie', 'trailer', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'commentary', 'cast', 'and/or', 'director', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'quality', 'regardless.Youngman', 'Duran', 'Maskai', 'indian', 'who', 'tribe', 'reservation', 'police', 'officer', 'man', 'who', 'raised', 'death', 'parents', 'tribal', 'priest', 'named', 'Abner', 'Duran', 'greatly', 'Abner', 'worries', 'Abner', 'sanity', 'One', 'day', 'visit', 'Abner', 'Duran', 'will', 'call', 'indian', 'god', 'Yehwah', 'end', 'world', 'next', 'day', 'Duran', 'Abner', 'dead', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'Shortly', 'thereafter', 'reservation', 'plagued', 'huge', 'swarm', 'vampire', 'bats', 'who', 'launch', 'devestating', 'attacks', 'night.A', 'great', 'reason', 'movie', 'appeal', 'cast', 'instances', 'cornball', 'dialogue', 'main', 'actors', 'actually', 'do', 'well', 'respective', 'roles', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'win', 'Oscars', 'other', 'hand', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'win', 'Razzies', 'standout', 'David', 'Warner', 'scientist', 'Phillip', 'Payne', 'Warner', 'had', 'long', 'distinguished', 'carrer', 'movies', 'Tron', 'Star', 'Trek', 'VI', 'Undiscovered', 'Country', 'Titanic', 'television', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Genaration', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'never', 'given', 'bad', 'performance', 'anything', 'have', 'seen', 'performance', 'Nightwing', 'man', 'mission', 'hunt', 'down', 'destroy', 'vampire', 'bats', 'exception', 'Warner', 'top', 'speech', 'Duran', 'why', 'so', 'passionate', 'killing', 'vampire', 'bats', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'Seeing', 'Payne', 'work', 'bats', 'works', 'well', 'also', 'strong', 'point', 'Nick', 'Mancuso', 'Youngman', 'Duran', 'being', 'Italian', 'very', 'believable', 'role', 'Maskai', 'indian', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'dialogue', 'bit', 'silly', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'Kathryn', 'Harrold', 'Duran', 'love', 'interest', 'weakest', 'character', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'performance', 'script', 'will', 'allow.The', 'scene', 'where', 'bats', 'make', 'first', 'appearance', 'movie', 'actually', 'quite', 'well', 'fact', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'first', 'rate', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'number', 'times', 'movie', 'still', 'time', 'time', 'final', 'showdown', 'bats', 'not', 'perfect', 'still', 'quite', 'thrilling', 'movie', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'Nightwing', 'have', 'problems', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'entertainment', 'believe', 'least', 'stood', 'test', 'time']",Nightwing VHS

335314,A2XOV3ZKGDK55G,630279756X,"RBSProds ""rbsprods""","[8, 10]","FIVE STARS.  One of my favorite Horror/SciFi movies. A sensational low budget movie that begins with a farming problem facing an indian reservation that quickly becomes the basis for a great, unpretentious horror movie, without all of the CGI and 'wire-kung fu' nonsense that predominates most SciFi. It stays on target with no diversions. The plot really hangs together well and the story is similar to ""Alien"" where the characters are so excellently drawn by the script and the actors, that the dangerous circumstances really mean something to the audience when the characters are threatened. With terrific performances by Nick Mancuso as Deputy Youngman Duran, Kathryn Harrold as the love interest, Strother Martin in a hoot of a role, Stephen Macht, portraying Walker Chee, as good as he's ever been, and David Warner in a totally arresting and surprising role, director Arthur Hiller gets a ton of mileage from the cast. When nature, science, love, greed, and Native American folklore and religion collide things really get out of hand fast, with Duran in the middle of things. George Clutesi deserves special mention for his portrayal of Abner, a central character who is Mancuso's native American spiritual guide. The sound track has mesmerized me since 1979 when the movie came out: totally nailed by Henry Mancini (and sitting on my 'best of the best' cassette tape). The opening sequence is beautifully photographed especially if you love the desert southwest as I do.If you haven't read the other reviews yet, stop now and see the movie. Hopefully, you haven't read the spoilers. Let the movie take you on the journey. I think you'll enjoy it, if horror and SciFi are your main interest. Pop some popcorn, grab some sodas and enjoy this delightful romp!!  I watch the tape often and have ordered the DVD for a permanent keeper.
