They live with little income; they trade to get what they need for their large family. When the IRS discovers that they have never contributed to the government, a man goes to audit them. He finds it very difficult to determine what they owe due to their strange way of living and the fact that the teenage daughter (Debbie Reynolds) won't stop manhandling him. To make matters even more frustrating- for him at least- is that the family keeps bringing up that the government owes them payment for horses taken during the Civil War.The movie can make you think about the way the government works, a somewhat corrupt and unfair system. Although taxes paid for the IRS workers' car, it is considered taboo for the taxpayers to even touch it. The debt to the family from the Civil War is laughed at, but yet the taxes owed for a few decades are of the highest importance. However, these issues are barely touched upon due to the jovial nature of the film.The cast is great, especially Reynold's whose youthful vibrance lights up the screen whether she's running around shrieking or seducing older men.Overall, this is not a bad way to waste some time, but it isn't overly inspiring or exciting.",3,Let's Talk Government,1146787200,"05 5, 2006",2006,1299,"['Mating', 'Game', 'fun', 'somewhat', 'tedious', 'film', 'family', 'who', 'not', 'paid', 'taxes', 'whole', 'lives', 'live', 'little', 'income', 'trade', 'get', 'what', 'need', 'large', 'family', 'When', 'IRS', 'discovers', 'have', 'never', 'contributed', 'government', 'man', 'audit', 'very', 'difficult', 'determine', 'what', 'owe', 'due', 'strange', 'way', 'living', 'fact', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'manhandling', 'make', 'matters', 'even', 'more', 'frustrating-', 'least-', 'family', 'bringing', 'up', 'government', 'payment', 'horses', 'taken', 'Civil', 'War.The', 'movie', 'can', 'make', 'think', 'way', 'government', 'somewhat', 'corrupt', 'unfair', 'system', 'taxes', 'paid', 'IRS', 'workers', 'car', 'considered', 'taboo', 'taxpayers', 'even', 'touch', 'debt', 'family', 'Civil', 'War', 'laughed', 'yet', 'taxes', 'owed', 'few', 'decades', 'are', 'highest', 'importance', 'However', 'issues', 'are', 'barely', 'touched', 'due', 'jovial', 'nature', 'film.The', 'cast', 'great', 'especially', 'Reynold', 'youthful', 'vibrance', 'lights', 'screen', 'running', 'around', 'shrieking', 'seducing', 'older', 'men.Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'waste', 'time', ""n't"", 'overly', 'inspiring', 'exciting']",Mating Game VHS

I fell in love with Debbie Reynolds...but so did most of the guys my age back then.  Tony Randall was great!  It is a very old fashioned  movie, one that made you laugh, and in the end one that made you feel good.  We need more movies like that today.  I have to say, being able to own the  movie myself, and being able to watch it again, will be great. I'm going to  order a copy...but, don't count on being able to borrow it, I'm going to be  watching it too much, and then having my children watch it, too.

Of course to picture Tony Randall as the main romantic lead is hard after seeing him in so many other films as the side kick or laughter lead.This is definately not on any NETFLIX, or pay TV so either by it from the internet or look for it at garage sales.
