People talking about how good (or better) quality it has were talking about the older 3-disc edition. I actually am happy with the old 2nd season 3-disc edition. It has better quality than the 1st season.I don't know how bad will be the quality of this new 2-disc edition but I won't expect too much because I have the old First Season 2-DVD pack.It's your choice.

Sporting a catchy piano-laden theme song, the series showcased the unique comic talents of co-creator and co-star Paul Reiser, who sought to produce a show telling the true story of married life (he would later publish the bestselling book Couplehood, a compilation of various anecdotes on relationships)...Mad About You follows the lives of newlywed couple Paul (Paul Reiser) and Jamie Buchman (Helen Hunt), two urban professionals sharing an apartment in New York City. Although they are head-over-heals in love, the two appear to be near total opposites. Paul, a documentary filmmaker, is extremely meticulous, cautious, and careful. Jamie, on the other hand, is a public relations expert with more of a free-spirit outlook on life. With a number of friends and family always in the picture - Jamie's sister Lisa (Anne Ramsay), Paul's cousin Ira (John Pankow), and friends Mark (Richard Kind) and Fran (Leila Kenzle) - Paul and Jamie are constantly bombarded with job-related stress, the strange antics of their friends, and the discovery each others' individual quirks and habits. And it's a recipe that translates into great sitcom entertainment...The Mad About You (Season 2) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Murray's Tale"" in which Lisa takes the Buchman dog Murray for a walk only to return with the wrong dog. When Paul and Jamie organize a massive search, they eventually uncover the true whereabouts of Murray, along with the couple whose dog Lisa walked off with... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Married to the Job"" in which Paul and Jamie vent about their jobs only to discover that Jamie's boss is sitting right behind them, and ""Paul is Dead"" in which a man by the same name as Paul passes away, creating a bundle of problems for Paul and Jamie...Below is a list of episodes included on the Mad About You (Season 2) DVD:Episode 23 (Murray's Tale)Episode 24 (Bing, Bang, Boom)Episode 25 (Bedfellows)Episode 26 (Married to the Job)Episode 27 (So I Married a Hair Murderer)Episode 28 (The Unplanned Child)Episode 29 (Natural History)Episode 30 (Surprise)Episode 31 (A Pair of Hearts)Episode 32 (It's a Wrap)Episode 33 (Deconstructive Criticism)Episode 34 (Paul is Dead)Episode 35 (Same Time Next Week)Episode 36 (The Late Show)Episode 37 (Virtual Reality)Episode 38 (Cold Feet)Episode 39 (Instant Karma)Episode 40 (The Tape)Episode 41 (Love Letters)Episode 42 (The Last Scampi)Episode 43 (Disorientation)Episode 44 (Storms We Cannot Weather)Episode 45 (Up All Night)Episode 46 (With This Ring: Part 1)Episode 47 (With This Ring: Part 2)The DVD Report",5,One hilarious TV show...,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,2836,"['Nominated', '45', 'Emmys', 'winner', '16', 'eight-year', 'run', 'NBC', 'Mad', 'became', 'instant', 'smash', 'hit', 'TV', 'viewers', 'large', 'part', 'due', 'Seinfeldian', 'portrayals', 'married', 'life', 'big', 'city', 'Sporting', 'catchy', 'piano-laden', 'theme', 'song', 'series', 'showcased', 'unique', 'comic', 'talents', 'co-creator', 'co-star', 'Paul', 'Reiser', 'who', 'sought', 'produce', 'show', 'telling', 'true', 'story', 'married', 'life', 'would', 'later', 'publish', 'bestselling', 'book', 'Couplehood', 'compilation', 'various', 'anecdotes', 'relationships', 'Mad', 'lives', 'newlywed', 'couple', 'Paul', 'Paul', 'Reiser', 'Jamie', 'Buchman', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'two', 'urban', 'professionals', 'sharing', 'apartment', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'are', 'head-over-heals', 'love', 'two', 'appear', 'be', 'near', 'total', 'opposites', 'Paul', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'extremely', 'meticulous', 'cautious', 'careful', 'Jamie', 'other', 'hand', 'public', 'relations', 'expert', 'more', 'free-spirit', 'outlook', 'life', 'number', 'friends', 'family', 'always', 'picture', 'Jamie', 'sister', 'Lisa', 'Anne', 'Ramsay', 'Paul', 'cousin', 'Ira', 'John', 'Pankow', 'friends', 'Mark', 'Richard', 'Kind', 'Fran', 'Leila', 'Kenzle', 'Paul', 'Jamie', 'are', 'constantly', 'bombarded', 'job-related', 'stress', 'strange', 'antics', 'friends', 'discovery', 'others', 'individual', 'quirks', 'habits', 'recipe', 'great', 'sitcom', 'entertainment', 'Mad', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Murray', 'Tale', 'Lisa', 'Buchman', 'dog', 'Murray', 'walk', 'only', 'return', 'wrong', 'dog', 'When', 'Paul', 'Jamie', 'organize', 'massive', 'search', 'eventually', 'uncover', 'true', 'whereabouts', 'Murray', 'couple', 'dog', 'Lisa', 'walked', 'off', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'include', 'Married', 'Job', 'Paul', 'Jamie', 'vent', 'jobs', 'only', 'discover', 'Jamie', 'boss', 'sitting', 'right', 'Paul', 'Dead', 'man', 'same', 'name', 'Paul', 'away', 'creating', 'bundle', 'problems', 'Paul', 'Jamie', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Mad', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'Episode', '23', 'Murray', 'Tale', 'Episode', '24', 'Bing', 'Bang', 'Boom', 'Episode', '25', 'Bedfellows', 'Episode', '26', 'Married', 'Job', 'Episode', '27', 'So', 'Married', 'Hair', 'Murderer', 'Episode', '28', 'Unplanned', 'Child', 'Episode', '29', 'Natural', 'History', 'Episode', '30', 'Surprise', 'Episode', '31', 'A', 'Pair', 'Hearts', 'Episode', '32', 'Wrap', 'Episode', '33', 'Deconstructive', 'Criticism', 'Episode', '34', 'Paul', 'Dead', 'Episode', '35', 'Same', 'Time', 'Next', 'Week', 'Episode', '36', 'Late', 'Show', 'Episode', '37', 'Virtual', 'Reality', 'Episode', '38', 'Cold', 'Feet', 'Episode', '39', 'Instant', 'Karma', 'Episode', '40', 'Tape', 'Episode', '41', 'Love', 'Letters', 'Episode', '42', 'Last', 'Scampi', 'Episode', '43', 'Disorientation', 'Episode', '44', 'Storms', 'Can', 'not', 'Weather', 'Episode', '45', 'All', 'Night', 'Episode', '46', 'Ring', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '47', 'Ring', 'Part', '2', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A
743005,A18ZM0DL1MWZQ0,B00008J2EB,Carl Malmstrom,"[63, 66]","The second season of &quot;Mad About You&quot; is a surprisingly big improvement on the first.  While the first season showed glimpses of greatness in the interactions between Paul and Jamie, the second season saw them at ninety percent of their comedic ability.  There is still the occasional misfire or joke taken past the point of humor, but the majority of the seasons episodes work really, really well.With the second season, the casting settles down and the actors really find their rhythms with each other.  Lisa Kudrow's Urusula, the waitress at the local bar and grill Riff's, is an especially welcome addition as a recurring cast member.  Leila Kenzle's Fran gets much more depth as the separated and eventually-divorced best friend of Jamie and Anne Ramsay's Lisa (Jamie's sister) settles down nicely into a neurotic mess.There are some really memorable episodes from the season, especially &quot;Disorientation&quot;, featuring Jamie's first day in grad school, and &quot;Cold Feet&quot;, the Valentine's Day episode detailing how Paul proposed to Jamie.  Equally memorable (for opposite reasons) is &quot;Up All Night&quot; featuring a very unfortunate cameo by John Astin (the original Gomez Addams) as himself, showing that every so often the writers could still loose the line between great reuse of a joke and flogging a dead horse.  While much better than Season 1's truly unfortunate use of Jerry Lewis, &quot;Up All Night&quot; served as a reminder that the show was almost - but not quite - to the levels of excellence it would achieve in its middle years.Technically, the release is less of a disappointment that Season 1.  The spreading-out the the episodes onto three discs rather than two means that the episodes look decent on a laptop or HDTV system, but there are still no extras to speak of - not even chapter stops.  I'm happy to shell out the extra money for extra video quality, but it would be nice to have episode promos or commentaries or something.  As it is, though, it's nice to see them actively working at keeping the price of a full-season release of a TV show down.All in all, I do recommend this boxed set, although I think Columbia-Tristar could still put some more effort into the releases of future seasons.  As for the show itself, this is the season where the show really begins to find itself.

The relationship they developed between all the in-laws was just outstanding and one of the greatest bits.Season one was very enjoyable, but I think season two they really got their wind and showed just what they were all capable of doing.

Some claim that this results in improved picture quality, but I can't claim to notice this for myself.Of the two sets that have been released, this is my favorite by far. Some of the series classic episodes are in this set, like the episode where Jamie's sister loses Murray in the park and comes back with a dog that look like him.The discs still don't have chapter stops in the individual episodes like other televsion series that have been released on DVD. This is an annoying oversight that makes watching the series more frustrating. The audio quality is good, but this set will not stress out your sound system by any means.In closing, if you are fan of Mad About You then you should pick this set up. There are some major flaws, but otherwise it is a good buy.Pro's:The release of this series on DVDClassic episodes, like &quot;Paul is Dead&quot; and &quot;The Last Scampi&quot;Split up on three discsImproved picture quality, maybe...Con's:Still no chapter stopsStill no useful or interesting extrasEquipment Used:Sony Playstation 2Phillips 21&quot; television",4,"Not bad, but not perfect either",1052524800,"05 10, 2003",2003,1278,"['Mad', 'Season', 'Two', 'disc', 'out', 'have', 'made', 'improvements', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'still', 'problems.The', 'Season', 'Two', 'set', 'three', 'discs', '8', 'so', 'episodes', 'disc', 'claim', 'results', 'improved', 'picture', 'quality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'claim', 'notice', 'two', 'sets', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'favorite', 'far', 'series', 'classic', 'episodes', 'are', 'set', 'episode', 'where', 'Jamie', 'sister', 'Murray', 'park', 'back', 'dog', 'look', 'him.The', 'discs', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'chapter', 'stops', 'individual', 'episodes', 'other', 'televsion', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'annoying', 'oversight', 'watching', 'series', 'more', 'frustrating', 'audio', 'quality', 'good', 'set', 'will', 'not', 'stress', 'out', 'sound', 'system', 'means.In', 'closing', 'are', 'fan', 'Mad', 'then', 'should', 'pick', 'set', 'up', 'are', 'major', 'flaws', 'good', 'buy.Pro', 'release', 'series', 'DVDClassic', 'episodes', 'quot', 'Paul', 'Dead', 'quot', 'quot', 'Last', 'Scampi', 'quot', 'Split', 'up', 'three', 'discsImproved', 'picture', 'quality', 'maybe', 'Con', 'Still', 'chapter', 'useful', 'interesting', 'extrasEquipment', 'Used', 'Sony', 'Playstation', '2Phillips', '21', 'quot', 'television']",N/A
