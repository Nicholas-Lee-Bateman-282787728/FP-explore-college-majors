This is an excellent western comedy that should give most people a few good laughs.  Beyond Therapy I tried but couldn't find anything funny about it.  For me this is still a good buy.,5,One out of two ain't bad,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,277,"['got', 'two', 'movie', 'disc', 'Lust', 'Dust', 'was', 'cheaper', 'way', 'own', 'excellent', 'western', 'comedy', 'should', 'give', 'most', 'people', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'Therapy', 'tried', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'funny', 'still', 'good', 'buy']",Beyond Therapy / Lust in the Dust

When I saw this combo, I thought that I would take a chance, buy it, and pray for the best on the movie &#34;Beyond Therapy&#34;.  That was a major mistake!  &#34;Beyond Therapy&#34; is a homophobe's dream movie with so many horrible cliches that it is sickening!  I will avoid watching it.  As for &#34;Lust in the Dust&#34;, well what can I say?  C'mon, a movie with Divine, Tab Hunter, and Rita Moreno!  How can you go wrong?  But...having said that, if you can't afford the $25-$35 price range that some sellers are charging, get this.  Otherwise, do as I sometimes do and don't buy it and pray that the price will eventually go down.",3,Not a good combo,1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,733,"['When', 'bought', 'was', 'looking', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'copy', '34', 'Lust', 'Dust', '34', 'When', 'saw', 'combo', 'thought', 'would', 'take', 'chance', 'buy', 'pray', 'best', 'movie', '34', 'Beyond', 'Therapy', '34', 'was', 'major', 'mistake', '34', 'Beyond', 'Therapy', '34', 'homophobe', 'dream', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'horrible', 'cliches', 'sickening', 'will', 'avoid', 'watching', '34', 'Lust', 'Dust', '34', 'well', 'what', 'can', 'say', ""C'mon"", 'movie', 'Divine', 'Tab', 'Hunter', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'How', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'having', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', '25-', '35', 'price', 'range', 'sellers', 'are', 'charging', 'get', 'Otherwise', 'do', 'sometimes', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'pray', 'price', 'will', 'eventually', 'go', 'down']",Beyond Therapy / Lust in the Dust

One of the last staring roles by Tab Hunter, a 50's hunk...it has outrageous performances.
