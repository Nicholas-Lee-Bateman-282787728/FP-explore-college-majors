Mai Zetterling was the prototype of the perfect woman who never chose me.  I'm delighted to have the film back and like it as much as I did when Mai was a possibility, but I'm adding a mild cavil in light of the Bob Hope spy comedies of the same period with which it bears comparison, granting that the Hopes tend to be black & white and comedy-weighted against the Kayes' Technicolor and songs. (I ordered ""Knock on Wood"" in a package with ""My Favorite Spy."")While Bob sings on occasion, and in character, it doesn't impede the flow of the action, whereas when Danny does so in this and other of his films (notably ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty""; ""The Court Jester"" is an exception since the songs are appropriately placed) things come to a halt for several minutes and we're reminded that we're watching a performance by Danny Kaye before the story resumes.  The ""ballet"" sequence also seemed needlessly prolonged; Hope's work rarely lags.The late Virginia Mayo suggested in a memoir that, for a young actress, Hope was a greater pleasure to work with than Kaye, which may have been because of the absolute control Sylvia Fine appears to have exercised over her husband's career.

There was nothing in the repertoire of the comedy performer at which he was less  than superior, the aggregate of talents making him one of the uniquely inimitable ones.

Without mentioning names, there are more than a few excellent stars who convey to an audience just what a favor he or she is doing them by deigning to make an appearance. Whatever may have been his actual attitude, he, like Jack Benny, Bob Hope, George Burns, Bing Crosby and most of the enduring personalities, never left the audience in doubt that they were grateful to be given the chance to work for this group at this time.In this film produced by his own Deena Productions, a fine writing team, including, as always his wife, provided him with a vehicle which allowed him to exploit his many talents with not much help from the rest of the cast. Essentially, it is a one-man show, with an assortment of experienced second bananas, to provide him with the situations in which he makes us laugh.

We have had it in VHS recorded from AMC years ago (back when they were American Movie Classics) and it has seen plenty of use. We are thrilled to have it in DVD format, but wish it had been a studio release with better treatment. As mentioned in another review, it is in 1.85:1 aspect ratio and there are no extras here, not even closed captioning.In spite of all that, I am glad that it was released at all as a regular DVD (not DVD-R, as so many classics are these days). Some have mentioned their concern that it may be a bad transfer, as they saw in ""Inspector General"". I had a bad copy of that once (remember that it was in the public domain and people could get away with releasing it in any form of garbage) and this is a much better quality than that was, though not as sharp and crisp as if it had been digitally remastered.If Paramount wasn't prepared to do anything with it, then I am grateful Olive Films at least made it available to us.

I had no idea that he was so underrated until I started looking for his films on DVD.  WHAT'S THE DAEL? REALLY? They're either out of print or not available, I don't get it.  I grew up watching his old films on TV and have a lot of them still on VHS, and decided it was time to start getting the DVDs.  He's one of (if not thee) greatest talents in film history.

I have a full-screen copy I taped off of AMC in the 90's that has a bright clear picture, however the sound is so muffled on that print that I have to crank up the midrange on my EQ all the way - but there has to be a good print out there somewhere.

But to get to that point, there were steps along the way, and this was one of them.  Perhaps the first of Dena Production's films (Kaye's and wife Sylvia Fine's company), it showcases the many facets of Danny's talents, not the least of which is song and dance.  The title comes from a musical number while Kaye's character (Jerry Morgan) is recalling his childhood.  As he lies on the couch in the psychiatrist's office and relates his early years he tells the shrinks that his Mommy and Daddy are constantly yelling and throwing things and fighting.  &#34;Why do you think they do these things?&#34; he's asked.  &#34;They have to&#34;, he replies &#34;They're married!&#34;  At the core of this film are the stolen War Plans called Lafayette X V 27, which are cleverly hidden in Jerry Morgan's ventriloquist act dummies &#8212; Clarence and Terence.  Two spy rings are after the plans so that they might be sold to the highest bidder.  As the spys go after Jerry they unwittingly kill off each other, setting up Jerry to be the fall guy &#8212; and so now the Police want him as well!  He has to escape both of them to try to clear things up and in doing so we get some situations ripe for Kaye's antics.  He hides in an Irish pub amongdt the singers and revelers &#8212; he poses as a British car salesman to avoid Police (wherein we get the very funny 'decrimination' sequence as he tries to demonstrate an unfamiliar vehicle to a prospective client) &#8212; and, in perhaps the best sketch of them all, he hides in an opera  company about to perform a cossack dance!  In my opinion, this sketch alone is worth the price of admittance!  Overall the film takes off slowly and builds into a fine mix of comedy, pathos and romance.  Anyone who loves Danny Kaye will be thriled with the picture quality and sound of this Olive Films release.  Be forewarned though, there are no 'extras' &#8212; not even a trailer!

Knock on Wood stars Danny Kaye and Mai Zetterling. Other actors in the film include Torin Thatcher, David Burns, and Leon Askin. The film was written and directed by Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, with wonderful songs by Danny Kaye's wife, Sylvia Fine.Jerry Morgan (Kaye) is a ventriloquist who is having trouble with his love life: just when his relationship with his girlfriend gets around to marriage, his dummy turns jealous and spoils everything. Jerry's manager is so distraught; that he threatens to quit unless Jerry sees a psychiatrist, Enter Ilse Nordstrom, played by Zetterling, who tries to help Kaye find the source of his problem. The chemistry between Kaye and Zetterling throughout the movie is wonderful.  The two of them eventually fall in love.At the same time, Jerry becomes unwittingly mixed up with international spies, danger and intrigue, while he runs from the police. In his escape, Kaye does a funny impersonation of a British car salesman, trying to demonstrate a new convertible loaded with lots of bells and whistles. Later on, he finds himself trapped on stage in the middle of the performance of an exotic ballet.
