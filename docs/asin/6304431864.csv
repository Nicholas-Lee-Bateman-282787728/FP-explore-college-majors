421390,AXUDXQFT83YO9,6304431864,"John Gough ""John Gough - Deakin University""","[2, 3]","The Getting of WisdomThis is a brilliantly made film.The title comes from a Biblical passage extolling the benefit of acquiring wisdom: highly relevant both for its school setting, and for the glaring need of the central character to become more self-aware and sensitive to others.The film is based reasonably closely on the autobiographical novel of the same name.It is lovingly filmed in the old buildings and rooms of MLC (Methodist Ladies College, in Kew, a suburb of Melbourne, and in parks in East Melbourne close the site of the actual school the author attended and based the story on, and in a grand house in rural Victoria.In real life the author won a music scholarship to study at Leipzig. (This event arises in the last minutes of the film.)She (Henry Handel Richardson, her pen-name) later wrote a book about this European venture, and a failed career in virtuoso concert-music-making, called ""Maurice Guess"", filmed by Charles Vidor as ""Rhapsody"", starring Elizabeth Taylor!Later as a matured author, Henry Handel Richardson wrote one of Australia's great novels, based on the life of her father, ""The Fortunes of Richard Mahony"".The casting of ""The Getting of Wisdom"" is superb, and explains the plainess of the central character, Laura Tweedle Ramsbotham (the ""th"" is pronounced, deliberately, to avoid any hint of ""bottom"" in the name).Rather than the other famous Australian school-girl film ""Picnic At Hanging Rock"", this film ought to be compared with ""My Brilliant Career"", directed by Gillian Armstrong, starring Judy Davis and Sam Neill, another outstanding Australian film about intellectual brilliance trapped in stifling rural life and class-riddled society.While often hard to watch, because it is emotionally excoriating, this is because of the film's quality of acting, scripting, casting, and production that so vividly capture the pains of teenage bewilderment, and the era.Imagine watching a film about Louisa Alcott's famous rebel-girl would-be-writer Jo March going to an exclusive snobbish all-girls' college; sparks would fly, and often viewers would grimace at the clashes of personality, values, and brains.

Even though she, herself, was taunted and hurt so much she cried more than once, she decided it was better to treat other new girls just as cruelly as she'd experienced because, evidently, it's more important to be liked by the bullying in-crowd than to develop a character.Another 'wonderful' lesson she learned was that it works to cheat (on a final exam) because she was still recognized as a top student in the school. (I know the recognition wasn't for that class, but what would have happened to her life had she gotten caught?)If this is even remotely autobiographically motivated as some here have said, I would have thought she would have been too embarrassed to confess the lousy woman she became.

However, it just plodded along with the predictable lives of students' boarding at school and their old maid looking teachers. It's not even worth telling of the details. The story seemed disconnected, and at times, the audio made it hard to hear and understand the characters. Then, toward the end, there's a hint of lesbianism with three students; one of whom is expelled for stealing and an older one, who invites the leading character into her bed.Maybe a young woman inviting another one into her narrow bed for comfort was purely innocent.

421393,A2X25C107CSLOR,6304431864,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[6, 15]","This Australian film directed by Bruce Beresford was made in 1977 but not released in the U.S. until 1980, when overseas interest in Australian films was fueled by titles like My Brilliant Career and The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith. However Beresford is a lesser talent than either of the directors of those two films, Gillian Armstrong and Fred Schepisi. This film is like the underbelly of Peter Weir's 1975 Picnic at Hanging Rock, also set in a turn of the century ladies college, but while Weir's title is all romantic lyricism, Beresford goes for lowbrow comedy. Beresford's out to show how schoolgirls are just as cruel as schoolboys by placing a fish-out-of-water into their &quot;well-bred&quot; environment. Of course, it's no surprise that the impoverished heroine Laura is far more civilised than the other girls. That is, until she learns that the &quot;wisdom&quot; to be got is being an opportunist. Pauline Kael put it best when she wrote &quot;what she learns is the principle of contagion - that you get close to the powerful, so that their power can rub off on you, and stay clear of the helpless and weak, so their failure won't infect you&quot;. Such is the rewards of finishing schools. Beresford even gives us a freeze-frame close-up of Laura with over-bite begging for acceptance. He isn't interested in presenting these girls as beautiful or sensuous, and deliberately shows their facial pimples and awkward bodies. Even the suggestion of lesbianism in Laura's relationships with 2 girls are diffused by making one fat and expelled (for stealing from the others to buy a ring for Laura), and the other a rich older student, who cradles Laura in bed like a mother. The female staff are also grotesques - Sheila Helpmann as the schoolmistress wears an unwavering look of disdain, though when she drops it at Laura's graduation, we get a laugh, and Beresford undercuts the sight of floating black swans that Laura feeds by having them bleet loudly. The film works the best with Beresford's use of Laura's piano playing, when he edits to his comic routines, but he unfortunately indulges Barry Humphries as the school's minister in a long monologue where he denounces the thieving friend.",1,wisdom from opportunity,970099200,"09 28, 2000",2000,2207,"['Australian', 'film', 'directed', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'was', 'made', '1977', 'not', 'released', 'U.S.', '1980', 'when', 'overseas', 'interest', 'Australian', 'films', 'was', 'fueled', 'titles', 'My', 'Brilliant', 'Career', 'Chant', 'Jimmie', 'Blacksmith', 'However', 'Beresford', 'lesser', 'talent', 'directors', 'two', 'films', 'Gillian', 'Armstrong', 'Fred', 'Schepisi', 'film', 'underbelly', 'Peter', 'Weir', '1975', 'Picnic', 'Hanging', 'Rock', 'also', 'set', 'turn', 'century', 'ladies', 'college', 'Weir', 'title', 'romantic', 'lyricism', 'Beresford', 'lowbrow', 'comedy', 'Beresford', 'out', 'show', 'how', 'schoolgirls', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'cruel', 'schoolboys', 'placing', 'fish-out-of-water', 'quot', 'well-bred', 'quot', 'environment', 'course', 'surprise', 'impoverished', 'heroine', 'Laura', 'far', 'more', 'civilised', 'other', 'girls', 'quot', 'quot', 'be', 'got', 'being', 'opportunist', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'put', 'best', 'when', 'wrote', 'quot', 'what', 'principle', 'contagion', 'get', 'close', 'powerful', 'power', 'can', 'rub', 'off', 'stay', 'clear', 'helpless', 'weak', 'failure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'infect', 'quot', 'Such', 'rewards', 'finishing', 'schools', 'Beresford', 'even', 'freeze-frame', 'close-up', 'Laura', 'over-bite', 'begging', 'acceptance', ""n't"", 'interested', 'presenting', 'girls', 'beautiful', 'sensuous', 'deliberately', 'facial', 'pimples', 'awkward', 'bodies', 'Even', 'suggestion', 'lesbianism', 'Laura', 'relationships', '2', 'girls', 'are', 'diffused', 'making', 'one', 'fat', 'expelled', 'stealing', 'others', 'buy', 'ring', 'Laura', 'other', 'rich', 'older', 'student', 'who', 'Laura', 'bed', 'mother', 'female', 'staff', 'are', 'also', 'grotesques', 'Sheila', 'Helpmann', 'schoolmistress', 'unwavering', 'look', 'disdain', 'when', 'Laura', 'graduation', 'get', 'laugh', 'Beresford', 'sight', 'floating', 'black', 'swans', 'Laura', 'feeds', 'having', 'bleet', 'loudly', 'film', 'best', 'Beresford', 'use', 'Laura', 'piano', 'playing', 'when', 'comic', 'routines', 'unfortunately', 'Barry', 'Humphries', 'school', 'minister', 'long', 'monologue', 'where', 'thieving', 'friend']",Getting of Wisdom VHS
