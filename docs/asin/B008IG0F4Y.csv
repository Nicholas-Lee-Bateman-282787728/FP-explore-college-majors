1554166,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B008IG0F4Y,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[0, 0]","Girl in Progress starring Eva Mendes and newcomer Cierra Ramirez is a really sweet and thoughtful film. I was never a big fan of Eva Mendes before I saw this indie flick. Mendes is pretty to look at, but her acting for me was never very strong. But I must admit, Mendes is extraordinary and fearless in Girl in Progress. Mendes plays Grace, a single mother who's young daughter decides to make me her own ""coming-of-age"" adventure to try and frazzle her absentee mom. Grace is a mess emotionally, she is having an affair with a married doctor, she's working 2 meaningless jobs, and she can't afford to pay for her daughter's private school tuition. Her daughter, Ann is young and precocious, she feels like her mom never pays attention to her which is sad but true. Ann is smart but she is neglected, her mom refuses to act her age and Ann wants to grow up too fast. Girl in Progress is a real and honest film, I thought the ending was satisfying and made me tear up a little. I highly recommend this underrated gem, enjoy!

1554173,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B008IG0F4Y,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[5, 7]","------------------------------------------------------------""Girl In Progress""(Lionsgate, 2012)------------------------------------------------------------Note: mild spoilers below------------------------------------------------------------Eva Mendes plays a working-class latina single mother whose busy schedule limits her time with her increasingly resentful, frustrated teenage daughter. A precocious schoolgirl, Ansiedad (well played by newcomer Cierra Ramirez) feels neglected by her mother and crafts an elaborate plan to either force her to pay more attention, or to bust their family apart. Treating her life like a movie script, she methodically makes herself over into a ""bad girl"" and courts the hard-partying mean-chick clique at her school, with the goal of acting out and self-imploding so dramatically that her mom will have to deal with the fallout. Young, smart and self-confident, Ansiedad feels in control of her ""story,"" but along the way she makes choices that the audience can tell will bite her in the end. Although the film often has a light, glib feel -- think, ""Raven""-meets-""Lilo And Stitch""-meets-ABC Afterschool Special -- the final third of the film has surprising dramatic heft, as Ansiedad's mami finally realizes how much trouble her kid is in, and many nervous parents may find themselves involuntarily holding their breath until it all works out.The film presents a relatively nuanced view of latinos in America - Mendes' character works crappy jobs as a waitress and house cleaner, but aspires to get high-tech training in night school, while Ansiedad's best friend comes from a rich family, and we see other kids at her school who are comfortably upper-middle class, who party down to modern Spanish-language dance-pop, while mami and others enjoy ranchera music and '80s ballads. The male characters are fairly weak: Matthew Modine plays a predictably callow white guy who is dating the mom; early in the film I thought he would defy expectations and have more depth, but was disappointed by his portrayal as a self-involved jerk. One nice touch is that the mother doesn't have to be ""saved"" in the end by finding the right man -- mother and daughter remain together as a two-member, single-parent family, as they were at the start of the film. Patricia Arquette turns in a nice, solid performance as a dedicated school teacher, and plays the role with strong emotional layering. But it is Cierra Ramirez who really shines in this film: bubbly and sweet, and intensely charismatic, she fills the screen and makes a strong impression in her first feature film lead. Be worth it to keep an eye on this kid. All in all, this movie has some predictable elements, but is still an effective and sometimes moving drama. Worth a spin, perhaps even good as a tool for parents who want to try and talk about adolescence and anger issues with their kids. (Good luck with that!)

It's as close as American movies ever come to a true tragedy.This movie is about a girl, Ansiedad (which means anxiety in Spanish, which shows how clueless her mom is), who is really frustrated with her life, and wants to turn her life into a coming of age drama, where she escapes in the end by boarding a train.Ansiedad does a bunch of research, trying to figure out how to be the girl in the movie that breaks through, and attains popularity in school. After she's graphed this out in her room, she meticulously follows her plan, step by step. Everybody else in the movie is clueless about what she's doing, even when she tells them, and she keeps following her plan to it's tragic completion.Ansiedad is played by Cierra Ramirez, and her mom Grace is played by Eva Mendez. Ramirez does a great job of acting a super smart kid who's actually pulling off a crazy plan to get out of her childhood. And Eva Mendez does an awesome job of portraying a harried single mom, who is doing everything that she can, but it's still not enough. I'm definitely even more of a fan of Mendez than I was before.This movie is similar to the concept of: What if Abed fromCommunitywere a teenage Latin girl in a coming of age drama? Abed is only funny because he's one of seven main characters, and if the whole movie were about him, it would be a little depressing. Same thing for this movie, its so introspective that it will make you think. I love movies like this, but I know a lot of people hate them.Usually I don't like meta stuff too much, which is movies about movies, book about books, plays about plays. But this one is so smartly written, that I loved it.Pros:+Acting is awesome. Eva Mendez nailed the role of a clueless mom who is trying very hard, but still fails. Ramirez pulls off a hyper-smart kid left to her own devices.+This is a movie that made me think, and I'm still thinking about it+Well written, great storyCons:-It's not a comedy, and it's a serious story.

It's a movie directed by a woman, starring Hispanic women and dealing with a teenage girl coming of age - which involves a lot less pie-related sex. Hollywood is essentially a conservative place that can't even be bothered to make movies that pass the Bechdel Test most of the time so every movie made by and starring minorities becomes a test case for whether they will do these movies in the future or just go back to white dude movies.And this is awful.It's a self-congratulatory mess about a girl who is checking off the tropes of a coming of age movie. Presenting a list of tired coming-of-age cliches (drugs, going to parties, betraying the fat friend, etc.) is not the same thing as subverting them. The movie goes through the list, checking them off and being generally annoying. Ten minutes from the end of the movie and the only question I have is whether the boy that she wants to lose her virginity to is &#34;not really a lady's man&#34; because he's actually gay.
