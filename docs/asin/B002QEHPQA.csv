The most amazing thing about this movie is the fact that most of the locations this movie was filmed are the actual places John Dillinger and his gang were standing in close to 70 years ago!!!

1283806,A20VXYT5DL0ZC6,B002QEHPQA,"Amazon Customer ""Creator, Entrepreneur, Free ...","[3, 9]","To put it bluntly, Public Enemies is a mediocre film.After his 2000's disaster Collateral, Michael Mann has failed again to capture the magic and power of his 1990's crime blockbuster masterpiece, Heat.Public Enemies fails on many levels. Throughout the film, the actors dialogue on the soundtrack in often garbled, muffled and unintelligible. Christian Bale as the tough FBI agent Melvin Purvis goes through the entire film trying to pull off some type of tough-guy spoken accent that is supposed to be either Southern, Midwesterner, Chicago-tough or D.C. officer-bureaucratic, but his performance and speaking quality is so bad I can't tell which it is. Bale's failed accent attempt renders his entire performance throughout the film pathetically bad. Also, Bale likes to punctuate his powerful lines with a stony silent statue pose after all his big monologues, in which he freezes in front of the filming camera and tries to look tough and menacing but only manages to look stupid and laughable.The film simply fails to capture the type of intense drama and captivating performances and production values that were so addictively pleasurable in Heat.There is no aesthetic tension between two compelling and conflicting forces like between Heat's Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino and the gangsters versus the police in Heat.Public Enemies is simply not a very dramatic and exciting movie.The music of the film can't decide between playing 1930's depression-era folk songs, 1930's jazz and roaring 30's and love ballads, or an attempt at an atmospheric musical soundtrack. The film in fact does not have any of the atmosphere and palpable beauty of Heat--not even close. There is also zero character development from the screenplay. You never understand any of the motivations, thinking and personalities of the characters, not even of John Dillinger and his girlfriend, as handsome an actor as Johnny Depp is, as opposed to in Heat, where the character development began from the very first minutes and continued through to the film's climax. Also, the writers can't decide whether they want to portray the FBI agents as corrupt ""bad cops"" or honorable ""career officers"". One particularly stupid segment has a fattish FBI agent manhandling and beating Dillinger's girlfriend during an interrogation, when a superior comes in and slams him against the wall, with Bale carrying her out heroically. The scene wasn't heroic, it was ridiculously pretentious and fake. Are these FBI agents thugs or professionals, can't the writers and director decide?The photography is pretty ordinary throughout the whole 2  hours, the one exception being a nicely filmed segment at a 30's thoroughbred racetrack. The first quarter of the film is very weak, with the hard-to-follow dialogue and no substantive beginning and transitions. From the middle to the end it gets a wee bit stronger, but it is a lame, insignificant improvement.Basically, Public Enemies is a big disappointment and not worthy of being watched a second time, not even close, whereas I have seen Heat more than 30 or 40 times, could easily watch it another 40 times, and would jump at the chance to see it again on the big screen.",2,"""Public Enemies"": A mediocre failure",1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,3181,"['put', 'bluntly', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'mediocre', 'film.After', '2000', 'disaster', 'Collateral', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'failed', 'again', 'capture', 'magic', 'power', '1990', 'crime', 'blockbuster', 'masterpiece', 'Heat.Public', 'Enemies', 'many', 'levels', 'film', 'actors', 'dialogue', 'soundtrack', 'often', 'garbled', 'muffled', 'unintelligible', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'tough', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'entire', 'film', 'trying', 'pull', 'off', 'type', 'tough-guy', 'spoken', 'accent', 'supposed', 'be', 'either', 'Southern', 'Midwesterner', 'Chicago-tough', 'D.C.', 'officer-bureaucratic', 'performance', 'speaking', 'quality', 'so', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Bale', 'failed', 'accent', 'attempt', 'entire', 'performance', 'film', 'pathetically', 'bad', 'Also', 'Bale', 'punctuate', 'powerful', 'lines', 'stony', 'silent', 'statue', 'pose', 'big', 'monologues', 'front', 'filming', 'camera', 'tries', 'look', 'tough', 'menacing', 'only', 'look', 'stupid', 'laughable.The', 'film', 'simply', 'capture', 'type', 'intense', 'drama', 'captivating', 'performances', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'so', 'addictively', 'pleasurable', 'Heat.There', 'aesthetic', 'tension', 'two', 'compelling', 'conflicting', 'forces', 'Heat', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'gangsters', 'versus', 'police', 'Heat.Public', 'Enemies', 'simply', 'not', 'very', 'dramatic', 'exciting', 'movie.The', 'music', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'playing', '1930', 'depression-era', 'folk', 'songs', '1930', 'jazz', 'roaring', '30', 'love', 'ballads', 'attempt', 'atmospheric', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'fact', 'not', 'have', 'atmosphere', 'palpable', 'beauty', 'Heat', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'also', 'zero', 'character', 'development', 'screenplay', 'never', 'understand', 'motivations', 'thinking', 'personalities', 'characters', 'not', 'even', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'girlfriend', 'actor', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'opposed', 'Heat', 'where', 'character', 'development', 'began', 'very', 'first', 'minutes', 'continued', 'film', 'climax', 'Also', 'writers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'want', 'portray', 'FBI', 'agents', 'corrupt', 'bad', 'cops', 'honorable', 'career', 'officers', 'One', 'particularly', 'stupid', 'segment', 'fattish', 'FBI', 'agent', 'manhandling', 'beating', 'Dillinger', 'girlfriend', 'interrogation', 'when', 'superior', 'slams', 'wall', 'Bale', 'carrying', 'out', 'heroically', 'scene', 'was', ""n't"", 'heroic', 'was', 'ridiculously', 'pretentious', 'fake', 'Are', 'FBI', 'agents', 'thugs', 'professionals', 'ca', ""n't"", 'writers', 'director', 'decide', 'photography', 'pretty', 'ordinary', 'whole', '2', 'hours', 'one', 'exception', 'being', 'nicely', 'filmed', 'segment', '30', 'thoroughbred', 'racetrack', 'first', 'quarter', 'film', 'very', 'weak', 'hard-to-follow', 'dialogue', 'substantive', 'beginning', 'transitions', 'middle', 'end', 'wee', 'bit', 'stronger', 'lame', 'insignificant', 'improvement.Basically', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'big', 'disappointment', 'not', 'worthy', 'being', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'have', 'seen', 'Heat', 'more', '30', '40', 'times', 'could', 'easily', 'watch', '40', 'times', 'would', 'jump', 'chance', 'see', 'again', 'big', 'screen']",Public Enemies
1283807,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002QEHPQA,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Watching Johnny Depp filter his charm through an almost comatose portrayal of American Gangster, John Dillinger was disheartening.  I miss the old Depp, 90's Depp, the Depp with serious acting chops; the Depp there was before Depp was a huge name.  Remember `Benny and Joon'?  Remember `Ed Wood'?  Remember `Donnie Brasco'?  UGH, he's seriously tarnished his own reputation by lathering on uninspired Tim Burton caricatures, but I was hoping that working with Michael Mann may do him some good.  Sadly, `Public Enemies' is flawed from conception onward, and Depp's `barely there' performance doesn't help any.Aside from some sharp action sequences (Mann has always had a knack for sustaining tension within moments of pure chaos), `Public Enemies' suffers from lack of originality or inspiration, and it feeds off of old school clich&eacute;s in a way that doesn't pay homage, it merely insults.To get into a long list of `no' here would be tedious and unnecessary.  I'll just jot down a few quick notes to explain my disappointment with this film.First of all, the acting is just plain bland.  There is no real connection to any of these characters, outside of Billie who is brought to life by the amazing Marion Cotillard.  The only character who seems to be somewhat soulful or at least human is Babyface Nelson, and Stephen Graham (who was SO good in `This is England') plays him like a walking clich&eacute;, like he were trying to impersonate James Cagney, and it just doesn't work.  Both Depp and Bale come off stagnant; they barely register.  Bale is especially terrible here, showing no emotion and generating nothing from the audience.  When the film ends and they run a small blip of what happens to Melvin Purvis afterward, I didn't care.  The film didn't make him a real character; he was merely a prop.  The least said about Billy Crudup the better.  The production values, editing and cinematography were all fine; nothing special but nothing wrong either.  The editing was key to making those action scenes stand out, and I will admit that a few of the frames (especially with the brown tints and the glaring gunfire) were actually eye catching.  Still, the script was somewhat hollow and the character development of Dillinger was horribly manipulative.  In other words, Dillinger was a saint of sorts with a fetish for knocking over banks.  He is presented as a caring, kind, loving soul and you basically despise the law, who is depicted as woman beating Neanderthals.  I understand that good people do bad things because of circumstance, but this just seemed one-sided and unrealistic.And that ending, with the theater scene and the `prolific' presentation of `Manhattan Melodrama' was simply stupid, and that final burst of violence looked incredibly fake.At least Marion Cotillard was in this film.  She is a light in a dark tunnel, producing incredible light and stealing my heart with every spoken word.",2,Weak...,1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,2927,"['Watching', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'filter', 'charm', 'almost', 'comatose', 'portrayal', 'American', 'Gangster', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'was', 'disheartening', 'miss', 'old', 'Depp', '90', 'Depp', 'Depp', 'serious', 'acting', 'chops', 'Depp', 'was', 'Depp', 'was', 'huge', 'name', 'Remember', 'Benny', 'Joon', 'Remember', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Remember', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'UGH', 'seriously', 'tarnished', 'own', 'reputation', 'lathering', 'uninspired', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'was', 'hoping', 'working', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'may', 'do', 'good', 'Sadly', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'flawed', 'conception', 'onward', 'Depp', 'barely', 'performance', ""n't"", 'help', 'any.Aside', 'sharp', 'action', 'sequences', 'Mann', 'always', 'had', 'knack', 'sustaining', 'tension', 'moments', 'pure', 'chaos', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'suffers', 'lack', 'originality', 'inspiration', 'old', 'school', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'way', ""n't"", 'pay', 'homage', 'merely', 'insults.To', 'get', 'long', 'list', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'tedious', 'unnecessary', ""'ll"", 'just', 'jot', 'down', 'few', 'quick', 'notes', 'explain', 'disappointment', 'film.First', 'acting', 'just', 'plain', 'bland', 'real', 'connection', 'characters', 'Billie', 'who', 'brought', 'life', 'amazing', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'be', 'somewhat', 'soulful', 'least', 'human', 'Babyface', 'Nelson', 'Stephen', 'Graham', 'who', 'was', 'SO', 'good', 'England', 'walking', 'clich', 'eacute', 'were', 'trying', 'impersonate', 'James', 'Cagney', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'Depp', 'Bale', 'come', 'off', 'stagnant', 'barely', 'register', 'Bale', 'especially', 'terrible', 'here', 'showing', 'emotion', 'generating', 'nothing', 'audience', 'When', 'film', 'ends', 'run', 'small', 'blip', 'what', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'afterward', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'real', 'character', 'was', 'merely', 'prop', 'least', 'said', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'better', 'production', 'values', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'were', 'fine', 'nothing', 'special', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'either', 'editing', 'was', 'key', 'making', 'action', 'scenes', 'stand', 'out', 'will', 'admit', 'few', 'frames', 'especially', 'brown', 'tints', 'glaring', 'gunfire', 'were', 'actually', 'eye', 'catching', 'Still', 'script', 'was', 'somewhat', 'hollow', 'character', 'development', 'Dillinger', 'was', 'horribly', 'manipulative', 'other', 'words', 'Dillinger', 'was', 'saint', 'sorts', 'fetish', 'knocking', 'over', 'banks', 'presented', 'caring', 'kind', 'loving', 'soul', 'basically', 'despise', 'law', 'who', 'depicted', 'woman', 'beating', 'Neanderthals', 'understand', 'good', 'people', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'circumstance', 'just', 'seemed', 'one-sided', 'unrealistic.And', 'ending', 'theater', 'scene', 'prolific', 'presentation', 'Manhattan', 'Melodrama', 'was', 'simply', 'stupid', 'final', 'burst', 'violence', 'looked', 'incredibly', 'fake.At', 'least', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'was', 'film', 'light', 'dark', 'tunnel', 'producing', 'incredible', 'light', 'stealing', 'heart', 'spoken', 'word']",Public Enemies

1283809,AOXL514GEE4AA,B002QEHPQA,"Anthony &#34;Is Blu for You&#34; Scultore ""Up...","[3, 4]","Mann tells the story of John Dillinger (Depp) the last great American outlaw and the man who brought him down, FBI Agent Purvis (Bale). During The Great Depression, Dillinger was considered a folkhero. He stole from the banks but never the patrons. Old film footage even shows him treated like a rockstar upon his capture. Shockingly, Mann stays true to some historical facts, but he does take plenty of liberties to enhance the story. Using groundbreaking investigation techniques for that time, Purvis succeeds in capturing Dillinger. However, some good lawyering and a wood gun leads up to an extraordinary breakout. Agent Purvis is now even more determined to not only recapture the bank robber but to make sure he can never escape again!The movie is wonderfully acted by it's two leads, Bale and Depp. Mann loves to pit great actors against each other and it's nice to watch. Ultimately the story is not that compelling. It lacks the charm of other gangster flicks like ""The Untouchables"" and ""Mobsters"". Even though the movie runs 2 hours and 21 minutes there is substance missing. The movie desreves 3.5 stars not 3, but the option isn't available. A very good movie that could have been better.MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: This is the first Universal Blu ray that I was disappointed in. The picture is nice but not amazing. There are even some scenes where color seems a little off. Maybe this was a lighting decision to make it look like more of a period piece, who knows? The sound is either too loud or hard to hear. The special features are very interesting, especially the historical ones. FINAL VERDICT: A MUST OWN FOR GANGSTER MOVIE FANS! Still worth a watch.",3,"""We're here for the bank's money, not yours.""

I am not overly fond of steadicam work, but Mann is an exceptional director and he uses it here to put us into the middle of the tension of stickups, shootouts and getaways and it more or less worked for me.Mann is too good a film maker to err in casting, and there is fine work by everyone involved here with Depp and Cotillard as romantic leads at the top, and ably supported by Bale, Dorff and old pro Stephen Lang in a very small yet notable role as Agent Windom.The look of the film is authentic as to detail and the varying changes of looks in the film is stylish cinematography that augments the mood of the piece without distracting.The film is long but I found it never dull.  Michael Mann staged arguably the greatest shootout ever put on film in Heat.  While the gunplay in this film doesn't quite equal the excitement and thrill of that film, it is quite good, and these action sequences smoke.I don't know what you're looking for in a film, but this is a gangster film done to a fair-the-well and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

1283815,A3MFU0GVZUVH3K,B002QEHPQA,"Betty L. Dravis ""BETTY DRAVIS, author/reviewer""","[3, 3]","When this movie came on TV tonight, I was pleasantly surprised. I had heard and read the tragic story of John Dillinger all my life and since I missedPublic Enemies (Single-Disc Edition)when it came out in 1999, I stayed riveted to the TV.With a nation-wide man-hunt on for Public Enemy No. One, notorious bank robber John Dillinger, this drama takes the viewer along for the bloody, horrific ride. Throughout the tense action of brutal bank robberies, street warfare with Tommy-guns blazing in all directions, harrowing prison breakouts and life-and-death chases through eerie woods, I felt like I was ""inside"" the action.There isn't much humor in this movie, but what little there is comes from Dillinger himself who is endearingly cocky and overly confident. When he first meets and falls for beautiful coat-check girl Billie Frechette and she asks what he does, he says, ""I'm John Dillinger and I rob banks."" In that context, I couldn't help but laugh.Another show of wit was when he sang ""I'm headed for the last roundup,"" which struck me as humorous in an ironic way... Dark humor...or was it prophetic?Johnny Depp is brilliant in this role; he not only plays the part of Dillinger, he is the man! He's a smart, methodical man who outwits the FBI at every turn...except the last one, of course. His, posture, facial expressions and entire performance are ""dead on"" to how I think Dillinger would be. Although I abhor his crimes, I feel some sympathy for the hunted, haunted man.I found it odd that many citizens of that Depression era actually made a ""hero"" of him, which made for some rather ""touching"" scenes. One thing can be said for Dillinger, he was loyal to his gang and to his ""love,"" Billie Frechette, sympathetically portrayed by actress Marion Cotillard. Christian Bale was also excellent with his tight-lipped portrayal of FBI Special Agent Melvin Purvis, the man credited with bringing Dillinger down. (The FBI also targeted Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby Face Nelson.)I admired the agent who kept Dillinger's last, whispered words a secret from the other agents and delivered them to Billie personally. Whether this really happened or was ""movie drama"" I don't know, but I cried when Billie cried. I bet you will ""tear up"" when you hear what Dillinger said too. A sad ending, to be sure, but it ended the only way it could--with the message that must be delivered: Crime does not pay!I agree with Kathleen C. Fennessy from Amazon's product description who says, ""...it's still the best mainstream gangster epic in ages and ranks among Mann's finest works."" Kudos to Director Michael Mann for his incredible eye for detail and superb casting. A solid five stars for this realistic, exciting movie.Endnote: The movie is set in the golden era of bank robbers, a time when law enforcement struggled through its dark ages. Police departments were out-manned and outgunned, and J. Edgar Hoover's FBI agents were outsmarted. By the time Dillinger was killed outside a Chicago movie theater on July 22, 1934, his gang of yeggs--the era's name for bank robbers--had stolen tens of thousands of dollars from uninsured banks and shot about a dozen people, including police officers. The movie plays up Dillinger's life in Chicago, his robberies and his charisma, but it also glosses over several key robberies in my home state of Ohio. When I was a kid in Ohio, it was rumored that Dillinger hid-out in my hometown of Hamilton between robberies. A claim to fame?

In reality, both Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby Face Nelson were killed after John Dillinger and neither by the hand of Melvin Purvis. The film benefits greatly from the use of the actual places where several key events took place, such as the real Crown Point Jail, the real Little Bohemia Lodge (even in the actual room occupied by the real Dillinger) and the real Biograph Theater. The film never really tries to paint Dillinger and his gang as being anything more than criminals, although Depp's performance really captures something of the likeability that the real Dillinger reportedly possessed. If anyone who watches the film knows beforehand the real outcome of the story they won't be surprised. Unlike the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde, there is no attempt to romanticize the people involved or to gain sympathy for them. Although the relationship between John Dillinger and Evelyn ""Billie"" Frechette is the centerpiece of the film, it really is never explored fully. We end up not really knowing them at all. Marion Cotillard is lovely and intriguing as ""Billie"", but she never really has very much to do. Stephen Graham is also excellent as the psychotic Baby Face Nelson, although he also could have had more screen time. Stephen Lang is truly excellent as FBI agent Charles Winstead and the final scene outside the Biograph Theater will have you on the edge of your seat. I only wish the film had spent more time letting us get to know John Dillinger a little bit better. One thing the real Dillinger did was to sneak in visits to his family in Indiana. This is entirely absent from the film. Finally, it should be made widely known that the biggest villain in the story was FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, not Dillinger or Floyd or Nelson. In reality Hoover forced Purvis to resign shortly after Dillinger was killed. It seems Hoover was resentful of Purvis becoming a celebrity while he (Hoover) was left out of the spotlight. Hoover then proceeded to do everything possible to discredit Purvis until Purvis died. He even prevented Purvis from getting a number of other jobs after he left the FBI. Hoover ruled the FBI absolutely for fifty years. To read the truth of this side of the story check out the book ""The Vendetta"" written by Alston (son of Melvin) Purvis.

1283818,A30TQET02FLSUX,B002QEHPQA,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[0, 0]","Its rare that I actually think a movie should be longer, but Public Enemies (2009) is one of those films.  As Michael Mann's latest contribution to the crime drama genre, starring Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, the movie looks and sounds spectacular!  No shock coming from one of my favorite film directors of all time.  Mann is a genius at packaging visual imagery, storytelling, music and sound in all of his movies.  But Public Enemies feels a little short and abbreviated in its story and character development.  Granted, many filmgoers probably know some or all of the story of Depression Era bank robber John Dillinger.  But as I watched the movie, I kept wanting to know more about these guys and their stories.  That's why I watch the movies...to escape into the story and relationships of the characters.Maybe its just that I'm too young to know much about this story and Mann chose to exclude the ""obvious""...or maybe the wham-bam-thank-you-Ma'am film viewing audiences of today have finally gotten to Michael Mann like with so many filmmakers and Hollywood movie studios.  It seems to me that so many of the action-thriller-drama movies of today are mostly just about finding a fast way to connect one amazing action sequence after another.  Throw in a little sex or love story with a hot chic...add some frustrated gazes by the leading man while smoking a cigarette...and any other cool visuals that can transition you to the next best shoot-em-up-and-car-chase scene.  Now I'm not saying that Public Enemies is at that extreme because it is definately a much better crafted movie than that.  But compared to Mann's best movies (Heat, The Insider, and The Last of the Mohicans), I just feel a little let down with Public Enemies because Mann has set the bar so high with me for his movies.  He's managed to go an entire decade since I last really fell in love with one of his movies (The Insider from 1999).That being said...I still think Public Enemies is one of the better movies of 2009.  Its more than worth viewing simply for the incredible cinematography and soundtrack.  And the story is good...just not enough.  I have a feeling that I will appreciate this movie more upon subsequent viewings...as is the case with all of Michael Mann's films.  As an obsessive detail-oriented filmmaker, Mann's movies are just so packed with ""stuff"" that it takes time to process it all.  And maybe there is more subtext and story in this movie than I think upon first viewing.  And watching about an hour of `Making-Of' features on the bluray disc after seeing the movie got me more excited about the movie...because there was a lot more of the Dillinger story in those behind-the-scenes features.So check this flick out in your home movie theater soon.  And if you haven't seen Michael Mann's three 90s films...get them immediately for your viewing pleasure!",3,Worthy Michael Mann Viewing,1286323200,"10 6, 2010",2010,2865,"['rare', 'actually', 'think', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'longer', 'Public', 'Enemies', '2009', 'one', 'films', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'latest', 'contribution', 'crime', 'drama', 'genre', 'starring', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'shock', 'coming', 'one', 'favorite', 'film', 'directors', 'time', 'Mann', 'genius', 'packaging', 'visual', 'imagery', 'storytelling', 'music', 'sound', 'movies', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'little', 'short', 'abbreviated', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'Granted', 'many', 'filmgoers', 'probably', 'know', 'story', 'Depression', 'Era', 'bank', 'robber', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'watched', 'movie', 'kept', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'guys', 'stories', 'why', 'watch', 'movies', 'escape', 'story', 'relationships', 'characters.Maybe', 'just', ""'m"", 'too', 'young', 'know', 'much', 'story', 'Mann', 'chose', 'exclude', 'obvious', 'maybe', ""wham-bam-thank-you-Ma'am"", 'film', 'viewing', 'audiences', 'today', 'have', 'finally', 'gotten', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'so', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'studios', 'so', 'many', 'action-thriller-drama', 'movies', 'today', 'are', 'mostly', 'just', 'finding', 'fast', 'way', 'connect', 'one', 'amazing', 'action', 'sequence', 'Throw', 'little', 'sex', 'love', 'story', 'hot', 'chic', 'add', 'frustrated', 'gazes', 'leading', 'man', 'smoking', 'cigarette', 'other', 'cool', 'visuals', 'can', 'transition', 'next', 'best', 'shoot-em-up-and-car-chase', 'scene', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'extreme', 'definately', 'much', 'better', 'crafted', 'movie', 'compared', 'Mann', 'best', 'movies', 'Heat', 'Insider', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'just', 'feel', 'little', 'let', 'down', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'Mann', 'set', 'bar', 'so', 'high', 'movies', 'managed', 'go', 'entire', 'decade', 'last', 'really', 'fell', 'love', 'one', 'movies', 'Insider', '1999', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'think', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'one', 'better', 'movies', '2009', 'more', 'worth', 'viewing', 'simply', 'incredible', 'cinematography', 'soundtrack', 'story', 'good', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'have', 'feeling', 'will', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'more', 'upon', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'case', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'films', 'obsessive', 'detail-oriented', 'filmmaker', 'Mann', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'packed', 'stuff', 'time', 'process', 'maybe', 'more', 'subtext', 'story', 'movie', 'think', 'first', 'viewing', 'watching', 'hour', 'Making-Of', 'features', 'bluray', 'disc', 'seeing', 'movie', 'got', 'more', 'excited', 'movie', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'Dillinger', 'story', 'behind-the-scenes', 'features.So', 'check', 'flick', 'out', 'home', 'movie', 'theater', 'soon', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'three', '90s', 'films', 'get', 'immediately', 'viewing', 'pleasure']",Public Enemies

Moody brutality reminds you of Mann's classic 1992 ""Last of the Mohicans"", and certainly his exceptional 2003 ""Collateral"".

1283831,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002QEHPQA,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 2]","When Depression-era bank robber John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) tries to woo the beautiful Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard), she tells him that she knows nothing about him. ""I was raised on a farm in Indiana,"" Dillinger replies. ""My mother died when I was three. My father beat the hell out of me because he didn't know a better way to raise me. I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars ... and you. What else do you need to know?"" The weakness of Michael Mann's ""Public Enemies"" is that Depp might as well have been saying this directly to the audience; in spite of his great performance, there's never a moment when we know who John Dillinger really is. Granted, this is merely a dramatic representation of a real life person, and in all fairness, Depp does portray him with an intriguing air of mystery. Still, I wanted to know more than what was presented on the screen. It might have helped if there weren't so many point-of-views to sort through.There is, in fact, only one scene that delved somewhat deeper. Late in the film, Dillinger drives a young woman to the police station so that she can apply for a waitressing license; in a brazen display of confidence and arrogance, he walks directly into the station and heads straight for the division handling his very case. I have no way of knowing whether or not this actually happened. I'll say this: If it did happen, either Dillinger was incredibly lucky or the cops were incredibly unfocused. Maybe it was a little bit of both.Along with figures like Homer Van Meter, ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd, Frank Nitti, and ""Baby Face"" Nelson, the real John Dillinger was one of the most notorious criminals of the early 1930s. He escaped from prison twice and robbed twenty-four banks and four police stations in the Midwest before being shot and killed outside Chicago's Biograph Theater at the age of thirty-one. In the film, his live fast, die young approach to life is mirrored in some of Depp's dialogue: ""They ain't tough enough, smart enough, or fast enough,"" he says to Billie, trying to reassure her that the cops wouldn't be able to catch him no matter what he did. To believe oneself to be invincible is to invite nothing other than tragedy, which is something Billie seems to understand. At the same time, she's so blindsided by her love for him that she seems willing to push those feelings aside.Another interesting but undeveloped Dillinger trait is the fact that he'll gladly hold up banks but stop short of personal robberies. When a frightened man empties his pockets of cash, Dillinger calmly says, ""We're here for the bank's money, not yours. Put it away."" Noble act? Not really. Banks get their money from everyday people, so stealing what little cash a person carries is really no different in the grand scheme of things. Why does he think otherwise? This would have been something for Mann and his screenwriters to consider fleshing out; goodness knows it would have added some much needed depth to the story.This isn't to say that ""Public Enemies"" is completely unsuccessful. The performances, for one thing, are incredibly convincing, and this applies to more than Depp. Christian Bale shines as FBI agent Melvin Purvis, which is nice to see after a disappointing turn in this summer's ""Terminator Salvation."" Billy Crudup is bizarre but highly effective as FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, a stubbornly driven man who personally hired Purvis to oversee the newly declared War on Crime against public enemies like Dillinger. Cotillard, fresh from her Oscar-winning stint in ""La Vie en Rose,"" plays Billie with a wonderful mixture of confidence and vulnerability. We also have decent cameo appearances by David Wenham, Giovanni Ribisi, Stephen Dorff, Channing Tatum, Leelee Sobieski, and Matt Craven.Some have taken issue with the film's camerawork, Mann opting for mostly shaky handheld shots. While I agree that it becomes a problem during the frenetic shootout scenes, it contributes greatly on the whole, accentuating the suspense and rawness of the story. The muted cinematography successfully evokes a 1930s grittiness that practically goes hand in hand with crime dramas. It's not so much a look as an entirely separate and interactive presence.If only the same effort was put into developing the characters a bit further. This is a story told from multiple angles, pretty much to the point that it's unclear who the protagonist is. You'd think Dillinger would be the obvious answer, but keep in mind that just as much time is spent on Purvis. Also keep in mind that many of Dillinger's actions are based on his relationship with Billie, who comes into her own by the second half of the film. With three characters all vying for prominence in the space of 140 minutes, it's easy to see why ""Public Enemies"" doesn't go as deep as I would have liked it to. Ultimately, I can only recommend it for what it presents aesthetically. The actors believably inhabit their characters. The visuals are cold and brutal. The dialogue is sharp and succinct. Essentially, it masters the appearance, but it doesn't quite have a handle on the emotion.",4,Armed and Dangerous,1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,5112,"['When', 'Depression-era', 'bank', 'robber',

1283834,A3QB2VPGHT0SVC,B002QEHPQA,"C. Monk ""CM""","[1, 2]","I really wanted to love this movie but it just tried to do too much in too short of time.The main character of this film is John Dillinger(Depp) who Michael Mann attempts to make into a sympathetic character by giving him a love story but we also see Dillinger shoot several cops; guns them down without a second thought.  Meanwhile, we have the lead ""good guy"" in Melvin Purvis(Bale) who has almost half the screen time that Depp has.  He is shown as a sometimes inspiring lead but also an arrogant or inept leader who resorts to heavy-handed tactics sometimes.  What happens is that we the audience ends up not really caring about either.When telling a story, you need a protaganist and you need an antagonist; good guy and bad guy.  There was neither in this film.Another aspect was that they tried to bring in so many other undercurrents, such as the conflict between Purvis and Hoover and the eventual falling out of Dillinger with the Chicago Syndicate.  Neither of these was fully told or explained and really took time away from the two main actors.As for the supporting cast, I was shocked to learn AFTER watching the film that such actors as David Wendham and Stephen Dorff were in this film because they had maybe a combined 5 minutes screentime.  So another issue was that there were way too many minor characters who were poorly defined.  You have to watch the movie several times to get who is Homer and who is Pierpont...Another issue was that alot of the dialogue was tough to understand.  I don't know if the actors were just all mumbling or what but many of the lines went unheard.Maybe if Michael Mann had spent another hour in this film to fully flesh out the characters and give them defined roles, maybe cut out some of the minor characters and then maybe create some real drama between the characters...then this would have been a good film.It gets 3 stars for the scene where Dillinger is shot, for the action scenes and for the music",3,Tried to be too much,1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,1958,"['really', 'wanted', 'love', 'movie', 'just', 'tried', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'short', 'time.The', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'Depp', 'who', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'make', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'giving', 'love', 'story', 'also', 'see', 'Dillinger', 'shoot', 'several', 'cops', 'guns', 'down', 'second', 'thought', 'Meanwhile', 'have', 'lead', 'good', 'guy', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'Bale', 'who', 'almost', 'screen', 'time', 'Depp', 'shown', 'sometimes', 'inspiring', 'lead', 'also', 'arrogant', 'inept', 'leader', 'who', 'heavy-handed', 'tactics', 'sometimes', 'What', 'audience', 'up', 'not', 'really', 'caring', 'either.When', 'telling', 'story', 'need', 'protaganist', 'need', 'antagonist', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'was', 'film.Another', 'aspect', 'was', 'tried', 'bring', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'undercurrents', 'such', 'conflict', 'Purvis', 'Hoover', 'eventual', 'falling', 'Dillinger', 'Chicago', 'Syndicate', 'was', 'fully', 'told', 'explained', 'really', 'took', 'time', 'away', 'two', 'main', 'actors.As', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'shocked', 'learn', 'AFTER', 'watching', 'film', 'such', 'actors', 'David', 'Wendham', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'were', 'film', 'had', 'maybe', 'combined', '5', 'minutes', 'screentime', 'So', 'issue', 'was', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'minor', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'poorly', 'defined', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'get', 'who', 'Homer', 'who', 'Pierpont', 'issue', 'was', 'alot', 'dialogue', 'was', 'tough', 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'actors', 'were', 'just', 'mumbling', 'what', 'many', 'lines', 'went', 'unheard.Maybe', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'had', 'spent', 'hour', 'film', 'fully', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'give', 'defined', 'roles', 'maybe', 'cut', 'out', 'minor', 'characters', 'then', 'maybe', 'create', 'real', 'drama', 'characters', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'film.It', '3', 'stars', 'scene', 'where', 'Dillinger', 'shot', 'action', 'scenes', 'music']",Public Enemies

I rob banks."" He just says it. When it comes to being cool, nobody is cooler than Johnny Depp. He fits the role of real-life notorious bank robber John Dillinger, like a glove in Public Enemies.I guess I have an itching desire for gangster movies; in 2006, my favorite film of the year was The Departed and in 2007 it was American Gangster. You want my pick for the best movie of 2009? Here it is folks.It's absolutely baffling that Public Enemies was overlooked entirely for the Oscars. I thought for sure it would have been nominated in categories for best picture, directing, best actor in a leading role (Johnny Depp), best adapted screenplay, costume design, cinematography, sound, and original score. Man, was I wrong.Director Michael Mann brings us another masterpiece filled with some of the best detailed action sequences imaginable. He is an expert at filling good action movies with a plausible plot and colorful characters. The Last of the Mohicans, Miami Vice, Heat and Collateral are all examples of his artistic ability to do so.We learn a lot about John Dillinger in the very beginning of the film. He doesn't like the police, he doesn't like rules and he doesn't like idiots within his own crew. This is all shown in an exciting prison break sequence. Dillinger and others break into a prison to bust some of their pals out. While doing so, one of them is killed, thanks to the negligence of one of the guys within the crew. In response to this, Dillinger beats the man about the face and then throws him from a moving vehicle.While he sounds cruel, you should know that he does at least have a soft spot for his gal. Much like the way Denzel's character Frank Lucas met his girl in American Gangster; Dillinger meets his at a nightclub, and simply has to have her. His classic one-liners he uses to woo her will be jotted down by guys, to use later and will make girls even more week in the knees for Johnny Depp.Dillinger's girl is Billie Frechette, played wonderfully by Marion Cotillard. Her scenes with Dillinger are not the film's main focus, but you get everything you need from them to keep you engulfed in the story and its characters. Their love is pure, unconditional and they want nothing more than to be together; which makes it all the more exciting for us as audience members, knowing they are being hunted down by the police.Billy Crudup (the blue naked guy from Watchmen) is a seriously underrated actor and is going to make it big; just wait. He plays FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. When Hoover is virtually being eaten alive by the press and the courts, due to Dillinger's reign of madness, he calls on an agent whose reputation precedes him: Melvin Purvis.Christian Bale has the role of Purvis, and plays him not quite as good as he played Batman, but significantly better than he did John Connor. He makes for a nice screen-match with Johnny Depp.Having just taken down another notorious bank robber by the name of Pretty Boy Floyd, Purvis is the perfect man for the job. He soon learns however, that Dillinger may be a little more than he can handle on his own. So he calls in some experts to assist him. One of which was played superbly by a guy up and coming in Hollywood, whom I have my eye on: Stephen Lang.We have an extensive game of cat and mouse that keeps us on the edge of our seats. Before Dillinger can walk away form the bank robbing scene and live happily ever after with his gal, he must do what every other `Hollywood gangster' does: take on one final score that will set him up for life.Public Enemies is hands down one of the best gangster pictures of all time. From the detailed costumes, to the old-school cinematography style, the movie takes us back to the 1930s; and we enjoy the trip.",5,Public Enemies Review,1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,4248,"['PUBLIC', 'ENEMIESSTARRING', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'John', 'Ortiz', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'James', 'Russo', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'Geoffrey', 'Cantor', 'Chandler', 'Williams', 'Channing', 'TatumWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'Ronan', 'Bennett', 'Ann', 'Biderman', 'based', 'book', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'America', 'Greatest', 'Crime', 'Wave', 'Birth', 'FBI', '1933-34', 'Bryan', 'BurroughDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Michael', 'MannRated', 'RGenre', 'Action', '/', 'DramaRelease', 'Date', '01', 'July', '2009', ""'m"", 'John', 'Dillinger', 'rob', 'banks', 'just', 'When', 'being', 'cool', 'nobody', 'cooler', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'role', 'real-life', 'notorious', 'bank', 'robber', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'glove', 'Public', 'Enemies.I', 'guess', 'have', 'itching', 'desire', 'gangster', 'movies', '2006', 'favorite', 'film', 'year', 'was', 'Departed', '2007', 'was', 'American', 'Gangster', 'want', 'pick', 'best', 'movie', '2009', 'Here', 'folks.It', 'absolutely', 'baffling', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'was', 'overlooked', 'entirely', 'Oscars', 'thought', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'categories', 'best', 'picture', 'directing', 'best', 'actor', 'leading', 'role', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'best', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'costume', 'design', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'original', 'score', 'Man', 'was', 'wrong.Director', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'masterpiece', 'filled', 'best', 'detailed', 'action', 'sequences', 'imaginable', 'expert', 'filling', 'good', 'action', 'movies', 'plausible', 'plot', 'colorful', 'characters', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'Heat', 'Collateral', 'are', 'examples', 'artistic', 'ability', 'do', 'so.We', 'learn', 'lot', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', ""n't"", 'like', 'police', ""n't"", 'like', 'rules', ""n't"", 'like', 'idiots', 'own', 'crew', 'shown', 'exciting', 'prison', 'break', 'sequence', 'Dillinger', 'others', 'break', 'prison', 'bust', 'pals', 'out', 'doing', 'so', 'one', 'killed', 'thanks', 'negligence', 'one', 'guys', 'crew', 'response', 'Dillinger', 'man', 'face', 'then', 'moving', 'vehicle.While', 'cruel', 'should', 'know', 'least', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'gal', 'Much', 'way', 'Denzel', 'character', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'met', 'girl', 'American', 'Gangster', 'Dillinger', 'nightclub', 'simply', 'have', 'classic', 'one-liners', 'woo', 'will', 'be', 'jotted', 'down', 'guys', 'use', 'later', 'will', 'make', 'girls', 'even', 'more', 'week', 'knees', 'Johnny', 'Depp.Dillinger', 'girl', 'Billie', 'Frechette', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'scenes', 'Dillinger', 'are', 'not', 'film', 'main', 'focus', 'get', 'everything', 'need', 'keep', 'engulfed', 'story', 'characters', 'love', 'pure', 'unconditional', 'want', 'nothing', 'more', 'be', 'together', 'more', 'exciting', 'audience', 'members', 'knowing', 'are', 'being', 'hunted', 'down', 'police.Billy', 'Crudup', 'blue', 'naked', 'guy', 'Watchmen', 'seriously', 'underrated', 'actor', 'going', 'make', 'big', 'just', 'wait', 'FBI', 'director', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'When', 'Hoover', 'virtually', 'being', 'eaten', 'alive', 'press', 'courts', 'due', 'Dillinger', 'reign', 'madness', 'agent', 'reputation', 'Melvin', 'Purvis.Christian', 'Bale', 'role', 'Purvis', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'played', 'Batman', 'significantly', 'better', 'did', 'John', 'Connor', 'nice', 'screen-match', 'Johnny', 'Depp.Having', 'just', 'taken', 'down', 'notorious', 'bank', 'robber', 'name', 'Pretty', 'Boy', 'Floyd', 'Purvis', 'perfect', 'man', 'job', 'soon', 'however', 'Dillinger', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'can', 'handle', 'own', 'experts', 'assist', 'One', 'was', 'played', 'superbly', 'guy', 'up', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'whom', 'have', 'eye', 'Stephen', 'Lang.We', 'have', 'extensive', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'edge', 'seats', 'Dillinger', 'can', 'walk', 'away', 'form', 'bank', 'robbing', 'scene', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'gal', 'must', 'do', 'what', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'gangster', 'take', 'one', 'final', 'score', 'will', 'set', 'up', 'life.Public', 'Enemies', 'hands', 'down', 'one', 'best', 'gangster', 'pictures', 'time', 'detailed', 'costumes', 'old-school', 'cinematography', 'style', 'movie', 'back', '1930s', 'enjoy', 'trip']",Public Enemies

1283837,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B002QEHPQA,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[1, 4]","Johnny Depp is hitting his stride in recent years with his Pirates of the Caribbean films and character roles.  Director/writer Michael Mann has been a respected stylist of the crime genre with such notables as Heat, Thief, and TV's Miami Vice.  The union of these two super talents results in a more than satisfactory retelling of the legendary bank robber, John Dillinger, in Public Enemies.  This violent tale focuses on the free spirit of Dillinger and his infamous robberies in the Midwest at the height of the Great Depression.In 1933, the country is in the midst of the Great Depression and bank robber John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) captures the public's fascination and even folk hero worship.  Having helped to break his friends out of prison, he continues his robberies in and around Chicago.  As the crime wave sweeps the Midwest, the FBI's J. Edgar Hoover enlists up and coming agent, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), (who has just nailed Pretty Boy Floyd,) to capture Dillinger, Public Enemy Number One.  Purvis employs a variety of sophisticated listening devices and police work to track him.  Dillinger thinks he is invincible and executes even more daring bank robberies.  He dates hat check girl Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) and travels with her to Florida for horse races and then to Arizona, where lawmen recognize and arrest him.  Transported to Indiana State Penitentiary, an easier place to breakout than a federal prison thanks to his mob lawyer, he uses a fake gun to engineer an escape.  He is joined by notorious hothead robber, Baby Faced Nelson, and they score more violent robberies.  Purvis insists on recruiting a crack force of Texas lawmen who assist him in closing in on the Dillinger gang leading to a memorable shootout in Little Bohemia.  As Dillinger crosses the state line, he violates federal laws and brings pressure on organized criminals, who turn on the fugitive.  Billie's fear that John will be caught or killed is tempered by her love for him, and when she is captured by local law enforcement, Purvis intercedes.  When a call girl comes forward with information about Dillinger, Purvis sets up a fateful ambush at The Biograph Theater where the FBI will be waiting.It is interesting that Dillinger's relationship with organized crime syndicates helped him with a legal infrastructure that disappeared once the mob deemed him a risk to their lucrative business.  Further, Hoover's political agenda was desperate to make headlines and build the FBI into a future powerhouse of law.  It is also fascinating how technically proficient the FBI was on its use of wire taps and eavesdropping devices while being relatively incompetent in conducting a simple arrest or taking part in a shootout.What is refreshing is the core romance between Dillinger and Billie Frechette.  Dillinger is presented as bold, charismatic and at times ruthless.  It is his bravado that attracts fellow criminals and Billie to him.  Cotillard gets a strong role that is considerably more than window dressing.  Her performance is convincing, and her chemistry with Depp's Dillinger makes this romance believable and heartbreaking thus lending an emotion subtext to the typical gangster movie.  Bales's Purvis is portrayed as an obsessed, determined lawman who is dry and dull in sharp contrast to the devil may care attitude of the freewheeling Dillinger.  Billy Crudup registers effectively as the young Hoover.  Mann favorite Stephen Lang, barely recognizable, registers a solid performance as a hardened Texas lawman who is critical to the end of the film.Besides the usual set designs and costumes to mimic the depression era, heavy use is made of period music.  The Little Bohemia shootout is a major set piece with heavy use of handheld cameras.  Although a detailed montage of action, it still does not have the visceral impact of John Milius' Dillinger or even the classic, G-Men.  There is also an extended bank heist reminiscent of Mann's Heat in its boldness and precision of execution.  The climactic ambush at the Biograph Theater is depicted in excruciating detail and still carries a great deal of tension.The last scene at a women's prison may never actually have happened, and it is curious that Lang's lawman and not Purvis serves as the catalyst for this key moment.  The subsequent, final shot of Cotillard after getting a special message is quite memorable.  It almost raises this film to another level.Public Enemies is not the best of Michael Mann, but it is a solid entry in his canon of crime films.  What is notable is another star turn by Depp, an actor at his creative peak.",3,PUBLIC ENEMIES Rekindles Gangster Era,1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,4627,"['Johnny', 'Depp', 'hitting', 'stride', 'recent', 'years', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'films', 'character', 'roles', 'Director/writer', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'been', 'respected', 'stylist', 'crime', 'genre', 'such', 'notables', 'Heat', 'Thief', 'TV', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'union', 'two', 'super', 'talents', 'results', 'more', 'satisfactory', 'retelling', 'legendary', 'bank', 'robber', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'violent', 'tale', 'focuses', 'free', 'spirit', 'Dillinger', 'infamous', 'robberies', 'Midwest', 'height', 'Great', 'Depression.In', '1933', 'country', 'midst', 'Great', 'Depression', 'bank', 'robber', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'public', 'fascination', 'even', 'folk', 'hero', 'worship', 'Having', 'helped', 'break', 'friends', 'prison', 'robberies', 'Chicago', 'crime', 'wave', 'Midwest', 'FBI', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'up', 'coming', 'agent', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'who', 'just', 'nailed', 'Pretty', 'Boy', 'Floyd', 'capture', 'Dillinger', 'Public', 'Enemy', 'Number', 'One', 'Purvis', 'variety', 'sophisticated', 'listening', 'devices', 'police', 'work', 'track', 'Dillinger', 'invincible', 'even', 'more', 'daring', 'bank', 'robberies', 'hat', 'check', 'girl', 'Billie', 'Frechette', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'travels', 'Florida', 'horse', 'races', 'then', 'Arizona', 'where', 'lawmen', 'recognize', 'arrest', 'Transported', 'Indiana', 'State', 'Penitentiary', 'easier', 'place', 'breakout', 'federal', 'prison', 'thanks', 'mob', 'lawyer', 'fake', 'gun', 'engineer', 'escape', 'joined', 'notorious', 'hothead', 'robber', 'Baby', 'Faced', 'Nelson', 'score', 'more', 'violent', 'robberies', 'Purvis', 'recruiting', 'crack', 'force', 'Texas', 'lawmen', 'who', 'assist', 'closing', 'Dillinger', 'gang', 'leading', 'memorable', 'shootout', 'Little', 'Bohemia', 'Dillinger', 'state', 'line', 'federal', 'laws', 'pressure', 'organized', 'criminals', 'who', 'turn', 'fugitive', 'Billie', 'fear', 'John', 'will', 'be', 'caught', 'killed', 'tempered', 'love', 'when', 'captured', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'Purvis', 'intercedes', 'When', 'call', 'girl', 'forward', 'information', 'Dillinger', 'Purvis', 'up', 'fateful', 'ambush', 'Biograph', 'Theater', 'where', 'FBI', 'will', 'be', 'waiting.It', 'interesting', 'Dillinger', 'relationship', 'organized', 'crime', 'syndicates', 'helped', 'legal', 'infrastructure', 'disappeared', 'once', 'mob', 'deemed', 'risk', 'lucrative', 'business', 'Further', 'Hoover', 'political', 'agenda', 'was', 'desperate', 'make', 'headlines', 'build', 'FBI', 'future', 'powerhouse', 'law', 'also', 'fascinating', 'how', 'technically', 'proficient', 'FBI', 'was', 'use', 'wire', 'taps', 'eavesdropping', 'devices', 'being', 'relatively', 'incompetent', 'conducting', 'simple', 'arrest', 'taking', 'part', 'shootout.What', 'refreshing', 'core', 'romance', 'Dillinger', 'Billie', 'Frechette', 'Dillinger', 'presented', 'bold', 'charismatic', 'times', 'ruthless', 'bravado', 'fellow', 'criminals', 'Billie', 'Cotillard', 'strong', 'role', 'considerably', 'more', 'window', 'dressing', 'performance', 'convincing', 'chemistry', 'Depp', 'Dillinger', 'romance', 'believable', 'heartbreaking', 'thus', 'lending', 'emotion', 'subtext', 'typical', 'gangster', 'movie', 'Bales', 'Purvis', 'portrayed', 'obsessed', 'determined', 'lawman', 'who', 'dry', 'dull', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'devil', 'may', 'care', 'attitude', 'freewheeling', 'Dillinger', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'registers', 'effectively', 'young', 'Hoover', 'Mann', 'favorite', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'solid', 'performance', 'hardened', 'Texas', 'lawman', 'who', 'critical', 'end', 'film.Besides', 'usual', 'set', 'designs', 'costumes', 'mimic', 'depression', 'era', 'heavy', 'use', 'made', 'period', 'music', 'Little', 'Bohemia', 'shootout', 'major', 'set', 'piece', 'heavy', 'use', 'handheld', 'cameras', 'detailed', 'montage', 'action', 'still', 'not', 'have', 'visceral', 'impact', 'John', 'Milius', 'Dillinger', 'even', 'classic', 'G-Men', 'also', 'extended', 'bank', 'heist', 'reminiscent', 'Mann', 'Heat', 'boldness', 'precision', 'execution', 'climactic', 'ambush', 'Biograph', 'Theater', 'depicted', 'excruciating', 'detail', 'still', 'great', 'deal', 'tension.The', 'last', 'scene', 'women', 'prison', 'may', 'never', 'actually', 'have', 'happened', 'curious', 'Lang', 'lawman', 'not', 'Purvis', 'catalyst', 'key', 'moment', 'subsequent', 'final', 'shot', 'Cotillard', 'getting', 'special', 'message', 'quite', 'memorable', 'almost', 'film', 'level.Public', 'Enemies', 'not', 'best', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'solid', 'entry', 'canon', 'crime', 'films', 'What', 'notable', 'star', 'turn', 'Depp', 'actor', 'creative', 'peak']",Public Enemies
1283838,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B002QEHPQA,DanD,"[2, 3]","PUBLIC ENEMIES is based upon the outstanding book by Bryan Burrough; however, where the book covers the entire crime spree spanning 1933-1934, the film focuses upon John Dillinger.  It bends quite a few facts (Dillinger and Melvin Purvis never actually met, for example) but remains an engrossing Hollywood adaptation of a criminal legend.  Dillinger's portrayal is romanticized a bit too much, as is Purvis (who wasn't exactly the most effective of lawmen), but these are typical Hollywood ad-ons that, let's face it, we were expecting.The film has a few flaws: the cinematography occasionally borders on amateur (at times, it looks like a PBS re-enactment); but at the same time, the film looks and feels REAL.  It drags a bit in the middle, which isn't entirely forgivable, and it doesn't live up to Michael Mann's magnum opus HEAT...but few films measure up to HEAT, and most films have slow spots.  These are forgivable mistakes.The reasons to watch this film?  Two, and you saw 'em coming: Johnny Depp and Christian Bale.  Depp is fantastic; he inhabits Dillinger's skin and thrives.  He's stuck with a few cheesy one-liners, but Dillinger delivers them with as much bravado as he can muster.  Bale, who has divulged in a few ego-boosting roles lately (primarily the most recent TERMINATOR flick), actually goes for a supporting role here, proving once again his knack for memorable performances.  Supporting roles by Giovanni Ribisi, Marion Cotillard, Billy Crudup, and others helps craft a well-rounded film.  As for the writing and directing, we've seen better from Mann, but we've seen much worse from the rest of Hollywood's players.

Steigman ""Movie fan from silents to now""","[0, 0]","Johnny Depp as John Dillinger & the law (headed by Christian Bale) is out to get him...it's as simple as that. I really enjoyed this film for the most part. It might have been a little long but overall it was well done. The acting was superb & there was plenty of shoot em up action. The best part was the fact that this was a tale from the 1930s and I love the 1930-1940 gangster movies.This of course did not have the charm of that era, nor did it have a Cagney, Bogart, or Robinson as well as Warner Brothers production values of that era to make the movie a superior effort but the cast was more than adequate. I loved watching those chase scenes in those older 1930s style automobiles.Part of me thinks that if the producers of films back then had the budget to make a film like this they most likely would have. One thing I liked about this movie was the story of how Dillinger met and fell for Billie Frechette (played by Marion Cotillard). Usually in the old crime dramas, the head crime boss usually had his 'dame'(as called in that era) already with him and in love with him. In this movie we get to see exactly just how a lady would fall for a crime boss. I thought it was a nice touch.Still better was the fact that this was a PG-13 - so the gore in this is purely your typical gunfire gore - I personally didn't find it overly bloody. Even better was the fact there was no scenes of a character vomiting which has become a standard in most newer films these days. It seems like every new movie (even Transformers & the latest Harry Potter film had this) has an obligatory barf scene which to me is unnecessary and not entertaining at all.Overall this was very good and while this might not be an all time classic, fans of older crime dramas and gangster films should find this to their liking..Of course the 2 disc DVD is the way to go if you are a collector and liked the movie..",3,Really solid modern gangster film - Id give it 3.5,1260576000,"12 12, 2009",2009,1893,"['Johnny', 'Depp', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'law', 'headed', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'out', 'get', 'as', 'simple', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'long', 'overall', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'was', 'plenty', 'shoot', 'em', 'up', 'action', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'tale', '1930s', 'love', '1930-1940', 'gangster', 'movies.This', 'course', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'charm', 'era', 'did', 'have', 'Cagney', 'Bogart', 'Robinson', 'as', 'well', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'production', 'values', 'era', 'make', 'movie', 'superior', 'effort', 'cast', 'was', 'more', 'adequate', 'loved', 'watching', 'chase', 'scenes', 'older', '1930s', 'style', 'automobiles.Part', 'producers', 'films', 'back', 'then', 'had', 'budget', 'make', 'film', 'most', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'One', 'thing', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'story', 'how', 'Dillinger', 'met', 'fell', 'Billie', 'Frechette', 'played', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Usually', 'old', 'crime', 'dramas', 'head', 'crime', 'boss', 'usually', 'had', ""'dame"", 'called', 'era', 'already', 'love', 'movie', 'get', 'see', 'exactly', 'just', 'how', 'lady', 'would', 'fall', 'crime', 'boss', 'thought', 'was', 'nice', 'touch.Still', 'better', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'PG-13', 'gore', 'purely', 'typical', 'gunfire', 'gore', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'overly', 'bloody', 'Even', 'better', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'scenes', 'character', 'vomiting', 'become', 'standard', 'most', 'newer', 'films', 'days', 'new', 'movie', 'even', 'Transformers', 'latest', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'had', 'obligatory', 'barf', 'scene', 'unnecessary', 'not', 'entertaining', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'time', 'classic', 'fans', 'older', 'crime', 'dramas', 'gangster', 'films', 'should', 'find', 'liking..Of', 'course', '2', 'disc', 'DVD', 'way', 'go', 'are', 'collector', 'liked', 'movie..']",Public Enemies

Thurlow,"[0, 0]","""Public Enemies"" offers a good director (Michael Mann), a couple of very good actors (Johnny Depp and Christian Bale), a solid supporting cast (featuring Marian Cotillard and Billy Crudup) and a Depression-era cops and robbers theme.  What could go wrong?The movie begins with the breakout from prison of bankrobber John Dillinger (Depp), who promptly goes on a cross-country bankrobbing spree with his old gang.  J. Edgar Hoover (Crudup), the publicity-hungry Director of the FBI, sends his best man, Special Agent Melvin Purvis (Bale) in pursuit.  The chase turns ugly, as Purvis finds his men are outgunned and calls in more lethel lawmen.  The result is a duel to the finish, as Purvis closes in on a desperate Dillinger.Mann never allows the movie to become black and white.  Dillinger is violent, but loyal to his buddies and to hatcheck girl Billie Frachette (Cotillard), with whom he carries on a romance.  Good guy Purvis is driven to uncomfortably ruthless methods to track Dillinger. In their one face to face meeting, Dillinger will tellingly observe that Purvis lacks the stomach for his job.The movie flows from one stylishly choreographed action sequence to the next, and they are all quite violent.  Mann spends lots of time meditating on the Depression-era landscape of American, without adding anything to the meaning of the movie, which somehow gets lost in the violence.  ""Public Enemies"" is a cinematically stylish and entertaining movie that never quite figures out what story it wants to tell; cautiously recommended.",3,"Hard men, hard times...",1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,1540,"['Public', 'Enemies', 'good', 'director', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'couple', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'solid', 'supporting', 'cast', 'featuring', 'Marian', 'Cotillard', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'Depression-era', 'cops', 'robbers', 'theme', 'What', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'movie', 'breakout', 'prison', 'bankrobber', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'Depp', 'who', 'promptly', 'cross-country', 'bankrobbing', 'spree', 'old', 'gang', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'Crudup', 'publicity-hungry', 'Director', 'FBI', 'best', 'man', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'Bale', 'pursuit', 'chase', 'ugly', 'Purvis', 'men', 'are', 'outgunned', 'more', 'lethel', 'lawmen', 'result', 'duel', 'finish', 'Purvis', 'desperate', 'Dillinger.Mann', 'never', 'movie', 'become', 'black', 'white', 'Dillinger', 'violent', 'buddies', 'hatcheck', 'girl', 'Billie', 'Frachette', 'Cotillard', 'whom', 'romance', 'Good', 'guy', 'Purvis', 'driven', 'uncomfortably', 'ruthless', 'methods', 'track', 'Dillinger', 'one', 'face', 'face', 'meeting', 'Dillinger', 'will', 'tellingly', 'observe', 'Purvis', 'stomach', 'job.The', 'movie', 'one', 'stylishly', 'choreographed', 'action', 'sequence', 'next', 'are', 'quite', 'violent', 'Mann', 'lots', 'time', 'meditating', 'Depression-era', 'landscape', 'American', 'adding', 'anything', 'meaning', 'movie', 'somehow', 'lost', 'violence', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'cinematically', 'stylish', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'never', 'quite', 'out', 'what', 'story', 'tell', 'cautiously', 'recommended']",Public Enemies

Edgar Hoover (Billy Grudup) and his team. This movie moves quickly through the months as Dillinger (Johnny Depp) commits bank robbery after bank robbery. Towards the end of the movie time seems to slow down, especially in the scene where Dillinger is seen walking in the late hours through the police office unbeknown to the remnants of the police force who are still working diligently in the office or listening to a ball game. Dillinger surveys this office which is dedicated to his capture, and the photos tacked to the walls feel like a walk down memory lane for Dillinger as he sees the faces of friends or associates who have died. This dreamy sequence, and the one just before he is shot, allows us the time to focus on the mortality of this man as his life is about to come to an end. The way this movie is paced and filmed is a beauty to behold.Other fine performances are by Christian Bale who portrays Purvis, the man in charge of capturing Dillinger, Marion Cotillard as Dillinger's girlfriend Billie Frechette, and Stephen Lang as the veteran Bureau agent.",5,A Masterpiece,1252800000,"09 13, 2009",2009,1188,"['Michael', 'Mann', 's', 'film', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'last', 'year', 'half', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'life', 'chased', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'Billy', 'Grudup', 'team', 'movie', 'quickly', 'months', 'Dillinger', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'bank', 'robbery', 'bank', 'robbery', 'end', 'movie', 'time', 'slow', 'down', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'Dillinger', 'seen', 'walking', 'late', 'hours', 'police', 'office', 'unbeknown', 'remnants', 'police', 'force', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'working', 'diligently', 'office', 'listening', 'ball', 'game', 'Dillinger', 'surveys', 'office', 'dedicated', 'capture', 'photos', 'tacked', 'walls', 'feel', 'walk', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'Dillinger', 'friends', 'associates', 'who', 'have', 'died', 'dreamy', 'sequence', 'one', 'just', 'shot', 'time', 'focus', 'mortality', 'man', 'life', 'come', 'end', 'way', 'movie', 'paced', 'filmed', 'beauty', 'behold.Other', 'fine', 'performances', 'are', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'who', 'Purvis', 'man', 'charge', 'capturing', 'Dillinger', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Dillinger', 'girlfriend', 'Billie', 'Frechette', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'veteran', 'Bureau', 'agent']",Public Enemies

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 5]","PUBLIC ENEMIES (2009), written/directed by Michael Mann, purports to tell the tale of John Dillinger, one-time Public Enemy Number 1. (Is Usama bin Laden still occupying that presently?) This review is for the FILM and not special dvds.Firstly before I bust a truss, I have to say this film is an excellent example of misuse of talent. Depp is certainly not miscast--but his performance is yawn-inducing. And aside from Dillinger's Public Enemy status, who are the ""public enemies"" of the title? Dillinger and Purvis? Dillinger and Hoover? Hoover and Purvis (that would have been very realistic)? Or is it simply cinema and the public?Never will I understand this stupid love affair we have with gangsters, mobsters and petty criminals, ancient and modern. Dillinger was a scumbag, and just because he had enemies who were in certain ways worse than he...well, no reason to start glorifying him. This film is Dillinger-obsessed.I'd have preferred to see the story of J. Edgar Hoover and his successful establishment of the FBI. Here, as played by the crazy Billy Crudup, Hoover is a mincing joke--the way they usually portray him. I happen to admire Hoover. He deserves better film treatment.Walter Winchell, among others, is totally ignored here though Winchell is mentioned. In fact, I was stunned at the position Billy Crudup had in billing. Let's just say it was nowhere near ""top"". And I cannot even find the name of the handsome actor who played Deputy Director Clyde Tolson, Hoover's real-life boyfriend. This film was easy in terms of top billing: Depp, Bale, Crudup.Better film treatment is also deserved by Agent Melvin Purvis (the odious Christian Bale, now that was miscasting)--the man who hunted Dillinger and got him in the end. Bale is certainly good at standing around looking menacing, but that's about it. A ""Bale Growl"", apparently, is cinema's new currency, unless you count the ""Depp Sag"".This film has little atmosphere. I was born and partially raised in one of the Chicago neighborhoods shown in this film. Well, I can tell you: they missed that by a mile. Another thing they missed was giving a good, taut story. Out of 145 minutes of film, I'd judge 75% was Dillinger and his girlfriend acting like star-crossed lovers.Yuck.Credit must be given to the attempt to bring Dillinger to life. He says a line about people leaving behind ""where they came from"" and worrying instead about ""where they're going"". If Dillinger really said that, he was quite right. In fact, Mann might have followed that bit of advice here.Seeing or buying this is up to the eyes of the beholder.

Dillinger was a Great Depression era bank robber that some labeled as Public Enemy number one, and others idolized him.  He robbed at least two dozen banks, murdered a handful of police officers and escaped from jail twice.Michael Mann's ""Public Enemies"" manages to capture the iconic, crime filled life and ultimately the gruesome death of John Dillinger with remarkable accuracy.  Dillinger's bank robbing career was shown with vivid detail; even his graceful movements during heists, earning him the nickname of Jackrabbit, were shown.  Credit Johnny Depp for playing Dillinger in such a ravishing performance.  Depp embodied the mannerisms, speech and character of the infamous bank robber.""Public Enemies"" is one of the best films of 2009.

1283856,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B002QEHPQA,Eric S. Kim,"[0, 0]","Michael Mann has got to be one of my all-time favorite directors. While I admire Stanley Kubrick for his unique storytelling and Tim Burton for his undying attention to irresistible visuals, Mann won my respect for his exploration of modern realism. He never sugarcoats elements in plot and character development. Movies like Heat and The Insider are more true to real life than what you would expect. If I'm in the mood for hard-hitting realism, then I choose a film from Mann (and other directors in the same vein). The Insider, Collateral, and Heat are among my favorite films.When I finished watching Mann's 2009 crime drama Public Enemies, I just felt good that I watched yet another film by Mann. But unfortunately, the movie itself needed some work. First off, the film felt very incomplete. Even if it centered on real-life robber John Dillinger and FBI agent Melvin Purvis during the downfall of the former's reputation, I wanted to know more about these characters. The movie seemed to lack proper character development because we don't exactly understand the character's origins very well. Perhaps if this had become a TV mini-series (as it was originally intended), then we probably would have had a clearer understanding of these individuals and their motives. Another problem is that the story starts right before Dillinger's downfall. It doesn't feel right to start at the beginning of his fall from grace because we don't know if we should root for this man or not. Plus, the romantic subplot between Dillinger and Frechette (played by Marion Cotillard) is not convincing onscreen. I just didn't feel the chemistry between the two, and even if Frechette was romantically involved with Dillinger in real life, I didn't think the romance in the film was necessary.But Public Enemies isn't a terrible film. It still has some good qualities. The performances from Depp, Bale, and Cotillard are especially noteworthy: it's Oscar material right here. The look of the film is amazing: great cinematography is a plus. The sets and costumes look completely realistic: good thing no one overlooked the researching for this project.I'd say that Public Enemies is a good film, though it's not perfect. I don't mind the few historical inaccuracies, but the major flaws in the film sort of turns me off. I do applaud Michael Mann and the cast and the crew for their efforts. This film might grow on me, but in the meantime, I give this film below a 7 (out of 10).Grade: 6.4 out of 10",3,Dillinger vs. Purvis,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,2485,"['Michael', 'Mann', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'directors', 'admire', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'unique', 'storytelling', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'undying', 'attention', 'irresistible', 'visuals', 'Mann', 'won', 'respect', 'exploration', 'modern', 'realism', 'never', 'elements', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'Movies', 'Heat', 'Insider', 'are', 'more', 'true', 'real', 'life', 'what', 'would', 'expect', ""'m"", 'mood', 'hard-hitting', 'realism', 'then', 'choose', 'film', 'Mann', 'other', 'directors', 'same', 'vein', 'Insider', 'Collateral', 'Heat', 'are', 'favorite', 'films.When', 'finished', 'watching', 'Mann', '2009', 'crime', 'drama', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'just', 'felt', 'good', 'watched', 'yet', 'film', 'Mann', 'unfortunately', 'movie', 'needed', 'work', 'First', 'film', 'felt', 'very', 'incomplete', 'Even', 'centered', 'real-life', 'robber', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'downfall', 'former', 'reputation', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'characters', 'movie', 'seemed', 'lack', 'proper', 'character', 'development', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'understand', 'character', 'origins', 'very', 'well', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'become', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'then', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'clearer', 'understanding', 'individuals', 'motives', 'problem', 'story', 'right', 'Dillinger', 'downfall', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'start', 'beginning', 'fall', 'grace', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'should', 'root', 'man', 'not', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'Dillinger', 'Frechette', 'played', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'not', 'convincing', 'onscreen', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'chemistry', 'two', 'even', 'Frechette', 'was', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Dillinger', 'real', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'romance', 'film', 'was', 'necessary.But', 'Public', 'Enemies', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'film', 'still', 'good', 'qualities', 'performances', 'Depp', 'Bale', 'Cotillard', 'are', 'especially', 'noteworthy', 'Oscar', 'material', 'right', 'here', 'look', 'film', 'amazing', 'great', 'cinematography', 'plus', 'sets', 'costumes', 'look', 'completely', 'realistic', 'good', 'thing', 'one', 'overlooked', 'researching', 'project.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'few', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'major', 'flaws', 'film', 'sort', 'turns', 'do', 'applaud', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'cast', 'crew', 'efforts', 'film', 'might', 'grow', 'meantime', 'give', 'film', '7', '10', '.Grade', '6.4', '10']",Public Enemies

1283859,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B002QEHPQA,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[2, 2]","PUBLIC ENEMIESThree things that I love about movies come together in this film, gangster films, Johnny Depp, and Michael Mann. When I first heard about this film I could not have been more excited about a film, all those things together and Depp is playing John Dillinger. Really and honestly what more could you ask for, I knew this would be a good film. As I thought when this first came out I was right, it is a good film. But after watching more I realized that it could have been more. I was sure what it was missing but it felt like it could have been more.I am sure you all know the story of John Dillinger the legendary outlaw that was officially the first public enemy number one. He was also one of the main reason the FBI was formed and was basically a hero in his time amongst the regular people. The people at the time looked at him as a person sticking it to the man during the Great Depression. Of course he loved this as is said in the movie, he hides out amongst those same people so he wants to be on their side. Dillinger was really an interesting dude who had a lot of charisma like when he speaks to the reporters after being captured, yes that really happened. Most of the stuff in here about Dillinger is spot on including locations, but other things have been changed like Baby face's death.So of course the title alone gives away what the film is about, the criminal life of one John Dillinger. Unlike a lot of biopic films this just focuses on the last part of his life when he was really infamous. From the incredible jail breaks to the heists it is all here, including his time with Baby face Nelson. Nelson was not the typical guy Dillinger would hang out with since he really didn't care about the people and was reckless. Still the film touches on all from Purvis and Hoover to the formation of the FBI. Of course his death and the famous lady in red situation is all here.I must say the film was brilliantly shot by Dante Spinotti and company, I loved the way it was presented. The look and feel of the film matches the time period perfectly, so here is to all those behind the camera. Director and co writer Michael Mann did a good job with this film in my opinion even though I still think it could have been more. Maybe it was the script that lacked that little something but it felt like it was just almost there, not completely a classic. Still even with that said and historical things out of place and or changed it was still an entertaining film.Johnny Depp was absolutely perfect to play Dillinger as he showcased the man at his charismatic best. Depp has never disappointed me ever and does not in this film, loved his performance as the confident outlaw. Christian Bale also does a great job as Melvin Purvis, the man appointed to hunt Dillinger and his fellow criminals of the time down. Bale is another guy that really as never disappointed me although he strikes me as the type that can truly shine under a great director. Channing Tatum is here for a short time as famous outlaw Pretty Boy Floyd and Billy Crudup portrays J. Edgar Hoover perfectly. Stephen Graham is really fun as Baby face Nelson and really makes him come to life, and also MMA legend Don Frye is here as Clarence Hurt one of the specialist brought in to hunt Dillinger down.This film is not entirely historically accurate but it a lot of the time, in fact the behind the scenes shows you just how much is real. I love that they shot his death scene at the actual spot, literally at the spot. The 2 disc addition includes a lot of great special features including documentaries on the real Dillinger and outlaws of the time. Also there is a great commentary on disc 1. I recommend this film because I enjoyed it and thought it was a really good film. It is not the classic it could have been but it is still a very good movie.",4,VERY GOOD FILM,1270598400,"04 7, 2010",2010,3841,"['PUBLIC', 'ENEMIESThree', 'things', 'love', 'movies', 'come', 'together', 'film', 'gangster', 'films', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'excited', 'film', 'things', 'together', 'Depp', 'playing', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'Really', 'honestly', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'ask', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'thought', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'right', 'good', 'film', 'watching', 'more', 'realized', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'was', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more.I', 'am', 'sure', 'know', 'story', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'legendary', 'outlaw', 'was', 'officially', 'first', 'public', 'enemy', 'number', 'one', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'main', 'reason', 'FBI', 'was', 'formed', 'was', 'basically', 'hero', 'time', 'regular', 'people', 'people', 'time', 'looked', 'person', 'sticking', 'man', 'Great', 'Depression', 'course', 'loved', 'said', 'movie', 'out', 'amongst', 'same', 'people', 'be', 'side', 'Dillinger', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'dude', 'who', 'had', 'lot', 'charisma', 'when', 'reporters', 'being', 'captured', 'yes', 'really', 'happened', 'Most', 'stuff', 'here', 'Dillinger', 'spot', 'including', 'locations', 'other', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'Baby', 'face', 'death.So', 'course', 'title', 'alone', 'away', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'criminal', 'life', 'one', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'lot', 'biopic', 'films', 'just', 'last', 'part', 'life', 'when', 'was', 'really', 'infamous', 'incredible', 'jail', 'breaks', 'heists', 'here', 'including', 'time', 'Baby', 'face', 'Nelson', 'Nelson', 'was', 'not', 'typical', 'guy', 'Dillinger', 'would', 'hang', 'out', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'people', 'was', 'reckless', 'Still', 'film', 'touches', 'Purvis', 'Hoover', 'formation', 'FBI', 'course', 'death', 'famous', 'lady', 'red', 'situation', 'here.I', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'shot', 'Dante', 'Spinotti', 'company', 'loved', 'way', 'was', 'presented', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'time', 'period', 'perfectly', 'so', 'here', 'camera', 'Director', 'co', 'writer', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'opinion', 'even', 'still', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'Maybe', 'was', 'script', 'lacked', 'little', 'something', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'almost', 'there', 'not', 'completely', 'classic', 'Still', 'even', 'said', 'historical', 'things', 'place', 'changed', 'was', 'still', 'entertaining', 'film.Johnny', 'Depp', 'was', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'play', 'Dillinger', 'showcased', 'man', 'charismatic', 'best', 'Depp', 'never', 'disappointed', 'ever', 'not', 'film', 'loved', 'performance', 'confident', 'outlaw', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'man', 'appointed', 'hunt', 'Dillinger', 'fellow', 'criminals', 'time', 'down', 'Bale', 'guy', 'really', 'never', 'disappointed', 'type', 'can', 'truly', 'shine', 'great', 'director', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'here', 'short', 'time', 'famous', 'outlaw', 'Pretty', 'Boy', 'Floyd', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'perfectly', 'Stephen', 'Graham', 'really', 'fun', 'Baby', 'face', 'Nelson', 'really', 'come', 'life', 'also', 'MMA', 'legend', 'Don', 'Frye', 'here', 'Clarence', 'Hurt', 'one', 'specialist', 'brought', 'hunt', 'Dillinger', 'down.This', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'historically', 'accurate', 'lot', 'time', 'fact', 'scenes', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'real', 'love', 'shot', 'death', 'scene', 'actual', 'spot', 'literally', 'spot', '2', 'disc', 'addition', 'lot', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'documentaries', 'real', 'Dillinger', 'outlaws', 'time', 'Also', 'great', 'commentary', 'disc', '1', 'recommend', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'classic', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'movie']",Public Enemies
1283860,A1AW35YVQ61AA3,B002QEHPQA,Frank Leonidas,"[7, 9]","This is a review of the movie -- not the Blu-ray -- and it does contain spoilers...It seems that a lot of the five star reviews I've read here all seem to admit the film had little or no character development. How can you say a film is ""five stars"" that has no character development? It's true by the way. Public Enemies had little to no character development. That's fine if you're making a movie about Elvis or Santa Claus. The audience already has some idea who these characters are in their own minds. When you're dealing with men like John Dillinger and Melvin Purvis things tend to get a little more vague for some folks.I saw Public Enemies in the theater. Loved the book by Bryan Burrough. I've also been a life-long Dillinger fan. Originally I had no desire to see this film half-expecting it to be bad. My curiosity eventually got the better of me. Where Johnny Depp soared in his larger than life take on guys like Ed Wood, George Jung and Hunter S. Thompson he went down like a lead balloon as Dillinger. John Herbert Dillinger was one of the most charismatic and charming criminals the world has ever known. Why then would Johnny Depp play him so tight-lipped? If you agree that Depp was tight-lipped in this film, Christian Bale as Purvis would have had no lips at all by comparison.In short, this was not the same Dillinger and Purvis that really lived. Okay, I know. Stop right there. It's only a movie. But wait just a minute -- this was a movie based on a beautifully written and meticulously researched piece of nonfiction. So why then does Dillinger appear in the beginning of the film at the infamous Walter Dietrich Indiana State Penitentiary breakout of 1933 when he was serving time himself in Lima, Ohio? Sure, Dillinger helped plan the ten-man escape but he did it from inside a prison cell. Surely writer/director Michael Mann read the book he based his film on. Didn't he?Why did Mann have to invent a scene like something out of Heat in which Dillinger (caged in a big cell &agrave; la Hannibal Lecter) has an actual confrontation with the man employed to catch him? Surely Dillinger and Purvis must have met like this in real-life? It had to be in the book too, right? Wrong. Dillinger was incarcerated in Crown Point, Indiana but he never met Purvis face-to-face. Ever. This was just pure made-up nonsense. Kind of like Purvis requesting outside help from experienced law enforcement professionals to combat the gangsters who were mowing-down his young white-collar agents with relative ease. In reality, it was Hoover (Purvis' boss) who brought in Charles Winstead and the other cowboy cops from Texas and Oklahoma because he thought Purvis was grossly incompetent. Turns out, Hoover was right. Purvis was a colossal failure. Hoover actually had him demoted. In fact, Purvis wasn't even in charge of the Dillinger investigation (Samuel Cowley was) in the final weeks leading up to Dillinger's eventual death. But he's still in charge in this movie. In fact, he's kind of portrayed as something of a reluctant hero; a taciturn stoic agent of the law. Sure he was.Then we come to Little Bohemia in April 1934. Aside from using the real Northern Wisconsin location in the film, this entire portion of the story is pure fantasy. This is what we know happened: Purvis failed yet again to nab Dillinger but he did manage to kill an innocent bystander and wound two others in the process. This is what is shown in the movie: Purvis guns down Baby Face Nelson in the woods outside the lodge. Shenanigans. Nelson wasn't even shot there. He outlived Dillinger. As did half of the gang members that Mann kills off during his film (including Stephen Dorff as Homer Van Meter). I suppose this was done in an effort to make Dillinger look like the last of the gang and all that. I get it. Shenanigans.Where in the film was Dillinger's well-known plastic surgery? Why they would choose to leave this critical bit of business out is beyond me. Instead, Mann has Dillinger walk undetected into the very office in downtown Chicago that has been created to catch him. He looks at photos on the wall of his old gang with the word ""DECEASED"" printed underneath them (even though most of them weren't dead yet in real-life) then he even stops and has a brief chat with some of the Agents who are listening to a ball game on a radio. Talk amongst yourselves on that one.Don't even get me started on Billie Frechette, Dillinger's long-time sweetheart. Dillinger had A LOT of girlfriends in his day but this movie chooses to focus solely on this relationship. Okay. I'll buy it. But did we really need the standard issue, contrived, Hollywood love story in a shoot-em-up John Dillinger movie? It's all for dramatic effect I would presume. Mann also leaves out the fact that Billie spent the rest of her life capitalizing off her association with Dillinger and touring in a theatrical show with members of Dillinger's own family. She died of cancer in 1969. Juliet Capulet she was not.After the Little Bohemia incident, the film dumps us right into the final hours. The place is the Biograph theater at 2433-43 North Lincoln Avenue in Chicago -- the scene of John Dillinger's death. If you want the real details of the incident, you should read the book Public Enemies or any of the other half-dozen or so books still in print about the life of John Dillinger. They are far more interesting and exciting than this film is. All you need to know is: Dillinger was betrayed by a woman, a madame named Ana Cumpanas (aka Anna Sage) who was in fear of being deported to Romania and cut a deal with Purvis to bring in Dillinger. A deal that Purvis later reneged on.Special Agent Charles Winstead was the man who was later credited with getting the Dillinger killshot. He is played quite effectively by the underrated Stephen Lang. He and Mann worked together before on Manhunter. Back when Mann used to make good movies. In reality, Winstead went to the Marbro Theater first unlike his showy scene in the film. When determining which of the two suspected theaters Dillinger will be at, Winstead asks which movie is playing at both. He is told a Shirley Temple film and a Clark Gable gangster picture. He replies: ""John Dillinger will not be seeing a Shirley Temple movie"" or something to that effect. It was a cute line nonetheless.The final scene plays out pretty much as I expected. Except for it being about 97% inaccurate. In reality, Purvis was sweating and shaking the whole time unlike Bale in the film who is never less than calm, cool and collected. There was a moment or two of chaos as the crowd emerged from the theater and some of the G-Men were fighting with the local cops and the theater manager (not in the movie) until finally Dillinger emerges with a girl on each arm. Despite a completely ridiculous camera shot of an overzealous (and near-retarded) Agent drawing his gun on the street about ten yards away from behind Dillinger (why weren't there any people screaming at the sight of this?) and then practically running toward him, they somehow managed to capture the actual moment of Dillinger's death PERFECTLY. It's by far the most accurate thing in the movie. Since the rest of the movie lumbers along like an old Chevy with four flat tires I can't help thinking this scene was gotten right by accident.Was the film entertaining? Not nearly as enjoyable as The Untouchables was. At least The Untouchables didn't pretend to be historical drama and it wasn't based on a highly lauded work of nonfiction. The Untouchables was intended to be a Hollywood historical fantasy and it's certainly one of the most entertaining movies of it's kind. It's a modern gangster melodrama. Public Enemies isn't any of these things. To be honest, I don't know what it is.Put simply: to me, the film has no soul. It is bland and predictable. The action is cluttered, the modern music throws it off and the performances fail to ignite any real depth or emotion. Worse yet, it's as if it were shooting for some level of drab realism yet it fell back on glossy convention every opportunity it had. I had a real hard time trying not to laugh during that cornball ending too with Frechette and Winstead. This film fails to even crack the surface of who John Dillinger was as a man. Dillinger was a charming, cold-blooded killer. He was without a doubt the most notorious and celebrated bank-robber this Country has ever seen. One of the biggest problems with this film for me was Mann hardly showed Dillinger robbing any banks at all. There's no real sense of time in the film or when things are actually happening. In the movie, John Dillinger tells us that he's a bank robber. There's the rub. Don't tell us, Johnny. Show us.",2,"""I was a good fellow, most people said, betrayed by a woman dressed all in red""",1263686400,"01 17, 2010",2010,8726,"['review', 'movie', 'not', 'Blu-ray', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'lot',

I never really got the urgency of why someone had to be here or there, so it didn't quite make sense when they were shocked by something or other.Attention to detail is impressive though. Watching the documentary, many of the locations were shot on-location at the historical location, and the actors cast bore a physical resemblence to the historical figures, which just about no one would really notice but Mann cast them anyways.It's worth watching.

Everyone on the net thinks their god damn siskel and ebert, trying to sound like a film carnoisseur but end up sounding like ignorant old farts who've lost touch of their inner child and are impossible to please.It really is a great throwback to 30s Gangster films and at the same time a very different take on the genre. While I wasn't crazy about the fact that it switches from film to video, that's really the only bad thing I have to say about it. The storytelling is amazing as usual from Michael Mann, you get very two different viewpoints on crime and right vs. wrong. Yet, somehow these two characters that have such conflicts are not so far off from each other. Johnny Depp gives another amazing performance as John Dillinger, it was such a convincing and different role for him. Christian Bale also gave an equally impressive performance as Special Agent Purvis. The visuals and attention to detail when it came to the time period was incredible, you really had a sense that you were in the 1930s. The action sequences, like all Michael Mann's films, were incredible and almost too life-like. When they fire Tommy Guns off of moving cars it doesn't look fake, but something that could actually be done. The fact that it wasn't over glorified really makes it all the more fun to watch. It's the closest Michael Mann has gotten to reigniting the magic of Heat and in many ways this is just as good. The fact that the film isn't as dynamic or charming as you might expect is really what makes it all the more realistic and worthwhile.

There is a certain admiral element of subtle dignity that Bale brings to this role. That is what I like about this film.Speaking of subtlety and restrained dignity, Stephen Lang's Charles Winstead plays a brief but pivotal role defining what law and order was intended to be bolstering Bale's performance as one of the special agents on Melvin Purvis' team.PUBLIC ENEMIES is worth watching; however it falls far short from its potential of exploring the real John Dillinger.",3,Interesting but Not Absorbing,1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,983,"['highly', 'anticipated', 'release', 'film', 'looking', 'something', 'innovative', 'perhaps', 'something', 'more', 'absorbing', 'previous', 'films', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'was', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'ethereal', 'performance', 'Dillinger', 'just', 'outright', 'uninteresting', 'totally', 'enigmatic', 'presence', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'bring', 'character.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'performance', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'dedicated', 'yet', 'restrained', 'approach', 'catching', 'up', 'Dillinger', 'certain', 'admiral', 'element', 'subtle', 'dignity', 'Bale', 'role', 'what', 'like', 'film.Speaking', 'subtlety', 'restrained', 'dignity', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'Charles', 'Winstead', 'brief', 'pivotal', 'role', 'defining', 'what', 'law', 'order', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'bolstering', 'Bale', 'performance', 'one', 'special', 'agents', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'team.PUBLIC', 'ENEMIES', 'worth', 'watching', 'however', 'far', 'short', 'potential', 'exploring', 'real', 'John', 'Dillinger']",Public Enemies

1283866,ANIMV3SPDD8SH,B002QEHPQA,Guy De Federicis,"[1, 2]","Two of the four of us nodded off into sweet gangster dreams watching Michael Mann's PUBLIC ENEMIES, the film is at times that dull. I managed to stay awake but experienced a late night sensation of vertigo and general discomfort absorbing Mann's dizzying frantic camera work and hurried pace. Characters didn't just walk across the screen, they streaked by, leaving a blurry trail of themselves, making it difficult for the eye to adjust to the next frame, which almost certainly was another violent gun-shooting blood bath.This much heralded gangster film wastes no time getting down to business with famed Depression era outlaw John Dillinger and his gang, breaking INTO prison to release their apparent cohorts, the first of many deliciously violent episodes, (guns galore!) which, strung together, fairly much tell the story of Dillinger as we know it; the audacious Hollywood-like movie lover with a moll draped to his arm, the prison soap bar successfully disguised as a weapon, the public infatuation, and strolling down a Chicago street after leaving a movie house where Clark Gable, William Powell, and Myrna Loy mirrored Dillinger's fate in ""Manhattan Melodrama"". While PUBLIC ENEMIES is being praised for not indulging in any Dillinger myths, yet showcasing them as the stuff of legend, I found the film to be only a high gloss and histrionic presentation of fact, a statuesque comic book version of gangster-dom, more Classics Illustrated than cool Marvel. This film loves the myth and is indifferent to the fact that John Dillinger was a cruel cut-throat who would stop at nothing to surround himself with the pleasures of life.I have a blind eye to Johnny Depp's performance as Dillinger. I just don't see it. His teeth flashing smirk seemed really 'put-on' to the point of grating on me, and his subdued characterization almost lulled me into a movie nap with my friends. Christian Bale as G-man Melvin Purvis, is all stone faced authority and god-like presence. Only director Mann's close-up indulgence into their raw faces gives the characters any amount of imagined depth.Yet this film breezes by with the constant machine gun shoot-'em-up special effects, that while loud and violent, have a gentle dance-like effect, spraying the mind with crackles and pops that relieve the senses to the often dull proceedings. The claustrophobic camera offers striking grey images of the era, the authenticity to detail seems superb, and if nothing else, the film keeps alerting you awake to Dillinger's next unlikely move, like a run of sensational headlines for an action hungry public.At the 2 hour mark though, I was rooting for the FBI to kill the guy and get it over with.",3,THE BALLAD OF JOHN DILLINGER,1246579200,"07 3, 2009",2009,2684,"['Two', 'four', 'nodded', 'off', 'sweet', 'gangster', 'dreams', 'watching', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'PUBLIC', 'ENEMIES', 'film', 'times', 'dull', 'managed', 'stay', 'awake', 'experienced', 'late', 'night', 'sensation', 'vertigo', 'general', 'discomfort', 'absorbing', 'Mann', 'dizzying', 'frantic', 'camera', 'work', 'hurried', 'pace', 'Characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'walk', 'screen', 'streaked', 'leaving', 'blurry', 'trail', 'making', 'difficult', 'eye', 'adjust', 'next', 'frame', 'almost', 'certainly', 'was', 'violent', 'gun-shooting', 'blood', 'bath.This', 'much', 'heralded', 'gangster', 'film', 'time', 'getting', 'down', 'business', 'famed', 'Depression', 'era', 'outlaw', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'gang', 'breaking', 'INTO', 'prison', 'release', 'apparent', 'cohorts', 'first', 'many', 'deliciously', 'violent', 'episodes', 'guns', 'galore', 'strung', 'together', 'fairly', 'much', 'tell', 'story', 'Dillinger', 'know', 'audacious', 'Hollywood-like', 'movie', 'lover', 'moll', 'draped', 'arm', 'prison', 'soap', 'bar', 'successfully', 'disguised', 'weapon', 'public', 'infatuation', 'strolling', 'down', 'Chicago', 'street', 'leaving', 'movie', 'house', 'where', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'William', 'Powell', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'mirrored', 'Dillinger', 'fate', 'Manhattan', 'Melodrama', 'PUBLIC', 'ENEMIES', 'being', 'praised', 'not', 'indulging', 'Dillinger', 'myths', 'yet', 'showcasing', 'stuff', 'legend', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'only', 'high', 'gloss', 'histrionic', 'presentation', 'fact', 'statuesque', 'comic', 'book', 'version', 'gangster-dom', 'more', 'Classics', 'Illustrated', 'cool', 'Marvel', 'film', 'myth', 'indifferent', 'fact', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'was', 'cruel', 'cut-throat', 'who', 'would', 'stop', 'nothing', 'surround', 'pleasures', 'life.I', 'have', 'blind', 'eye', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'performance', 'Dillinger', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'teeth', 'flashing', 'smirk', 'seemed', 'really', ""'put-on"", 'point', 'grating', 'subdued', 'characterization', 'almost', 'lulled', 'movie', 'nap', 'friends', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'G-man', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'stone', 'faced', 'authority', 'god-like', 'presence', 'Only', 'director', 'Mann', 'close-up', 'indulgence', 'raw', 'characters', 'amount', 'imagined', 'depth.Yet', 'film', 'constant', 'machine', 'gun', ""shoot-'em-up"", 'special', 'effects', 'loud', 'violent', 'have', 'gentle', 'dance-like', 'effect', 'spraying', 'mind', 'crackles', 'pops', 'relieve', 'senses', 'often', 'dull', 'proceedings', 'claustrophobic', 'camera', 'striking', 'grey', 'images', 'era', 'authenticity', 'detail', 'superb', 'nothing', 'else', 'film', 'alerting', 'awake', 'Dillinger', 'next', 'unlikely', 'move', 'run', 'sensational', 'headlines', 'action', 'hungry', 'public.At', '2', 'hour', 'mark', 'was', 'rooting', 'FBI', 'kill', 'guy', 'get', 'over']",Public Enemies
1283867,A1L9MIIBI7409N,B002QEHPQA,"G. YEO ""gyeo""","[0, 0]","Great script. Great action.  Terrific cast. But wrong camera!  Public Enemies is indeed one of Michael Mann's finest works and also showcases some of Johnny Depp and Christian Bale's most stellar performances.  But how Mann, a leading advocate of HD digital filmmaking still managed to deliver an epic so video-like in quality is beyond me.The entire movie, even on DVD, still has a strangely electronic video feel.  I avoided this in the theatres, precisely because the film trailers looked so oddly like a video blow up.  The colours are retained much better in the small screen, but the film's action and night sequences are tell tale giveaways that the picture we're seeing is a product of an electronic camera chip, and not the traditional 35 mm film camera.Still, Public Enemies is a highly enjoyable film for all its technical flaws.  I think Mann's love of electronic filmmaking needs better tools - I have not been impressed by his forays into the medium.  Previous films like Collateral worked better in terms of using the video format, but his love of shooting dark scenes just don't cut it.

My comments shouldn't stop anyone from watching the show, but as someone from the industry, it irked me a little.On a more significant note, Depp really shines as Dillinger and delivers the robin hood charisma; while Bale is well casted as his relentless and intense nemesis.

This is the first time I can remember a Johnny Depp or Christian Bale performance that had no charisma to it whatsoever. The film is not exciting enough to fall into the ""gangster film"" genre, and there is absolutely no insight at all into the John Dillinger character (or any of the other characters, for that matter), so it cannot be classified as a character study. So what is it? It plays like a series of unrelated vignettes from the last couple of years of Dillinger's life. Depp and Bale do not so much give wooden performances as they are given wooden characters by the script to portray.

1283871,A3RFXU3P0XKKF4,B002QEHPQA,"Herbert L Calhoun ""paulocal""","[1, 3]","I went to see this movie with an open mind. Like many moviegoers, I too knew the story of Dillinger's life: had seen it glamorized many times in grotesquely bad formulaic movies. When I saw that Depp was playing the lead role in this version, I thought: Hmmm, this could be an adventure in movie making? And unlike other reviewers, I was not disappointed.This director decided to remake the life of Dillinger as not just another crime ""shoot `em up"" but as a work of cinematographic art. So what does he do? He puts together a cast of great and near-great actors. He smoothes out the rough spots in the screenplay, understating the gratuitous violence (and making up for it by increasing the sound of the crackly of the gunfire, which raises the blood pressure without the teenage idiocy), adds an exquisite sound track and gives dimensional body and soul to all of the main characters.  (That is except for J. Edgar Hoover, who came off as the narcissistic arse-hole that he was in real life, which didn't bother me one bit).There isn't much more one can ask of a fine director, or of a fine movie.Even with a clich&eacute;d ""Clint Eastwood"" kind of `take no prisoners' personality,"" this was a fresh, almost human Dillinger. He still came through as a man struggling to make some sense of a shattered, disparate, crime-ridden, senseless life. His lament in the subtext, obviously was: If I could be normal just for a ""hot minute,"" I would give this life up in a heartbeat.His pursuers were depicted as equally human: hunting down their prey with both firm-jawed bureaucratic efficiency, interspersed with buffoon-like bureaucratic ineptness.Usually the clich&eacute;d one-dimensional ""tough guy"" personality is all one sees of Dillinger and other gangsters of his ilk (and of course, the FBI is always flawlessly efficient), but here we saw a man living on the edge of existence yearning and struggling to keep one foot in a reality that seemed to  make some kind of sense. Although robbing banks was his game, (and even though he had no idea of how to go about it), clearly trying to keep one foot in a life with the hope of some normality, was this Dillinger's name. Thus the tender desperation of his love interests and his love affair with an American Indian prostitute; his dreams of one last heist and just maybe, a life after crime...?While this probably will not be listed among the great gangster movies, since it was unnecessarily fragmented at times, it should be among them for no other reason than that as a piece of cinematographic art, it was exquisitely well put together. For this alone the movie has raised the bar and sets a new very high standard for ""gangster movies.""

What can come out of that? The FBI will become what it is now because of his death which will be an essential argument for Hoover to get what he wanted, money, men, cars and weapons. That's how history is made in American: on violence and blood, be it the blood of Indians, the blood of black slaves or ex-slaves, or the blood of gangsters, even at times the blood of workers when they turn strikers, and along with this blood a little bit of Caucasian blood or American blood to pepper the bill.This is the most important characteristic of this film: the cynicism of these legal killers in uniforms or without any uniforms but stars and other identifications, including dog tags. They have the right to kill because they run the risk of being killed. They are not better than the gangsters they are killing though the two categories are on the two sides of a road and it is always greener on the other side. Enjoy the pasture.The rest is romance and romantic fiction unluckily directly copied from real life. So the gangster has a girlfriend and she will be the collateral sentimental damage of his escape, hunt and execution in front of a cinema after watching a film with Clark Gable, some Manhattan Melodrama, or some tasteless film of that type. The end of the film is by the way irresistibly sad because they let us imagine that the crowd that takes over the scene of the killing is giving free rein to their anger and joy. A postmortem lynching, in a way.But we must say that after the prohibition and the repeal of this crazy amendment, under the New Deal on its way to solve a few problems, at a time when prisons were full, road gangs were long and busy building all kinds of public infrastructure with sweat, blood and hammers, the compulsory choice of going on the New Deal projects when you did not have a job and if you wanted your family to get some kind of dole, and that is called forced labor in my dictionary, at that time the only easy way for the mentally limited people who thought that weapons were the voice of God - if they could have done it they would have borrowed Gabriel's burning sword of flames - the only easy, was I saying, was to rob banks and use sheer brutality to do it.John Dillinger is the symbol of this intellectually underdeveloped vision of crime and there is no glory in defeating that kind of brilliant for sure but totally dull general of the war against capitalism that only robbed banks and stole the money the poor workers had put in the coffers of these banks. No attempt is made to rob the state or to rob industrialists, just only nothing but uniquely banks, and money available at the wicket, at the counter, at the cashier's window, in the teller's till and a little bit in the main safe.So do not be romantic about John Dillinger or his girl friend.

Add in more tommy and gatling gun action than a guy nicknamed Baby Face or Bugsy could desire, and I'm almost tempted to rob a bank myself.  Well, apparently, much more is necessary to make a hit capable of captivating an audience for two hours.John Dillinger (Depp), a man synonymous with the word infamous, and notorious for robbing banks, is in his prime.  With his crew, a bank is cleared out in mere minutes.  They are professionals in every sense of the word.  One guy even sounds sort of like the Bugs Bunny gangster, ""Yeah, see!  You'll never catch me coppers!""  Except he murders people in cold blood while giggling.Anway, FBI-man Melvin Purvis (Bale), is in charge of the Chicago division, and responsible for Dillinger's apprehension.  Tasked by J. Edgar Hoover to track down Dillinger, the man-hunt has just as much to do with ceasing the criminal's growing reputation and fan base as it does with the actual crimes.  Aside from a distracting, almost forced, love story subplot, the stage is set.For the most part, the movie is anti-climactic.  Anything semi-historical is going to be predictably in the gray-area of truth (from what I've read of other reviews, the movie misses by a wide historical margin), and the plot/scenes are essentially just people going through the motions.  Aside from a few old-fashioned gangster vs. cop shootouts (more on that in a minute), the movie drags from police precinct to phone relay station to brothel.  And it's not nearly exciting as that sounds.The shootouts, however, were something else.  The cinematography was exactly as expected of a big budget blockbuster.  Truth be told, however, I'm not sure if I liked them or not.  Without a background in film-making, I can't be sure how they were filmed, but there was a definite documentary-feel to some of the shots.  Almost too close, too intimate to appreciate the entirety of the action, but with a proximity that provides something extra.  It had the same appeal and failings of an old ball park.Bale and Depp are competently bland if not boring, and the gun-play perspective has to be seen to be properly evaluated, but this has flop written all over it (it's just not that interesting).

1283879,A188JKV8QVVOT7,B002QEHPQA,Jeremy Richmond,"[1, 2]","""Public Enemies"" is a great film about the bank robber John Dillinger. Johnny Depp plays John Dillinger and he is excellent. I haven't seen a performance by Depp like this since he was in Donnie Brasco.Watching this movie I got to see what made John Dillinger so infamous. The movie starts out with John Dillinger being led into a prison with extremely heavy security and despite this he escapes easily. The movie has one scene where John Dillinger goes to a night club and socializes with other people like he has nothing to worry about despite the fact that he's one of America's most wanted criminals. John Dillinger may have had guts, but what he did was still very wrong.Besides Johnny Depp, the movie has other actors like Christian Bale who plays Melvin Purvis (the law enforcer who's trying to capture John Dillinger), Marion Cotillard who plays Dillinger's love interest, and Billy Crudup who is unrecognizable as the number one G-Man J. Edgar Hoover.The movies shootout scenes are topnotch and had me on the edge of my seat. The movie perfectly captures 1930s America.

I won't go into the story as everyone probably knows what it is about. I think Depp was wonderful in this role and the whole movie just transported you back into the 1930's. They did a fantastic job with recreating the past. They even filmed this movie in the actual locations where the events took place...from the jail he was in,to the house where the shootout occurred,and finally at the theatre where he was shot. They even had Depp fall on exactly the same spot Dillinger did when he was killed. They show you this in the special features..which are worth watching. Bale was also great in this film too.

1283882,A2XQMGE2YY88DC,B002QEHPQA,Jiang Xueqin,"[5, 8]","The 1995 movie ""Heat"" made Michael Mann's movie career, and ever since then he has made movies similar to ""Heat"" in that the two leading characters manage to be both doppelgangers of each other while being a study in contrasts.  That could be said about ""Heat"" (1995), ""The Insider"" (1999), ""Collateral"" (2004), ""Miami Vice"" (2006), and now ""Public Enemies"" (the only exception to this rule is ""Ali"" (2001), which is also Michael Mann's best film since ""Heat"").In ""Public Enemies,"" Johnny Depp stars as John Dillinger and Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis, the FBI man tasked with hunting down public enemy number one.  There's a lot of moral ambiguity that makes ""Heat"" interesting, but ""Public Enemies"" is very heavy-handed.  Michael Mann asserts that John Dillinger represented American freedom, the lone hero who fights for love, friends, and honor in dark despicable times.  And in the end he's crushed by the social forces arrayed against him:  the dangerously ambitious J. Edgar Hoover who wants to use Dillinger's death to catapult himself into national fame and power, and the darkly powerful Syndicate who, in having reached a compromise with law enforcement to engage in sinisterly quiet racketeering, need to eliminate Dillinger because he is anything but sinisterly quiet.  With his friends all dead and his lover in jail, John Dillinger only hopes for a loud and fast death.The story is of course Hollywood, and having Johnny Depp star in the lead role assures a sympathetic rendering of the John Dillinger legend.  The real problems are the thinness of the script, the banality of the characters, and the entire pointlessness of the endeavor.  ""Heat"" was its own internal world, and that world was vast, striking, and knowable; ""Public Enemies"" involves both an era and a nation and so promises to offer a much larger world, but instead it comes across as small-minded and confined.  Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro made an interesting study in contrasts, and their dueling personalities made the movie dynamic and alive.  In ""Public Enemies,"" neither the characters of Johnny Depp and Christian Bale is developed so as to offer the audience an understanding of their personalities and worldview, and thus their duel really doesn't seem to have any purpose except to drive the plot along.""Public Enemies"" is a pointless waste of time.",3,"Nowhere near as good as ""Heat""",1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,2343,"['1995', 'movie', 'Heat', 'made', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'movie', 'career', 'ever', 'then', 'made', 'movies', 'similar', 'Heat', 'two', 'leading', 'characters', 'manage', 'be', 'doppelgangers', 'other', 'being', 'study', 'contrasts', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Heat', '1995', 'Insider', '1999', 'Collateral', '2004', 'Miami', 'Vice', '2006', 'now', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'only', 'exception', 'rule', 'Ali', '2001', 'also', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'best', 'film', 'Heat', '.In', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'FBI', 'man', 'tasked', 'hunting', 'down', 'public', 'enemy', 'number', 'one', 'lot', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'Heat', 'interesting', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'very', 'heavy-handed', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'represented', 'American', 'freedom', 'lone', 'hero', 'who', 'love', 'friends', 'honor', 'dark', 'despicable', 'times', 'end', 'crushed', 'social', 'forces', 'arrayed', 'dangerously', 'ambitious', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'who', 'use', 'Dillinger', 'death', 'catapult', 'national', 'fame', 'power', 'darkly', 'powerful', 'Syndicate', 'who', 'having', 'reached', 'compromise', 'law', 'enforcement', 'engage', 'sinisterly', 'quiet', 'racketeering', 'need', 'eliminate', 'Dillinger', 'anything', 'sinisterly', 'quiet', 'friends', 'dead', 'lover', 'jail', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'only', 'loud', 'fast', 'death.The', 'story', 'course', 'Hollywood', 'having', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'star', 'lead', 'role', 'sympathetic', 'rendering', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'legend', 'real', 'problems', 'are', 'thinness', 'script', 'banality', 'characters', 'entire', 'pointlessness', 'endeavor', 'Heat', 'was', 'own', 'internal', 'world', 'world', 'was', 'vast', 'striking', 'knowable', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'era', 'nation', 'so', 'promises', 'offer', 'much', 'larger', 'world', 'instead', 'small-minded', 'confined', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'made', 'interesting', 'study', 'contrasts', 'dueling', 'personalities', 'made', 'movie', 'dynamic', 'alive', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'characters', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'developed', 'so', 'offer', 'audience', 'understanding', 'personalities', 'worldview', 'thus', 'duel', 'really', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'purpose', 'drive', 'plot', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'pointless', 'waste', 'time']",Public Enemies

The quiet dialogue was counterpoint to the raging violence, thus intensifying it.  (I had no trouble understanding the dialogue.) The similarity of tone between Depp and Bale pointed out the similarities and differences of character as well, helping to blur distinctions between the inner workings of lawmen and lawless.  Christian Bale's monotone was ideal for showing the singleminded intensity with which Purvis pursued Dillinger, and Depp's low voice as Dillinger stood in stark contrast to the violence he was willing to wreak.2. The filming seemed in keeping with the era being portrayed, falling into almost sepia tones at times, and having a film noir quality that is perfect for the subject matter.  The jerky hand-held camera gives the viewer the impression that one is watching a newsreel of the action and heightens the sense of viewer participation.  Because of this ""you are there"" quality, I wished I could duck behind something, too, as the bullets were zinging past.3. The plot was protracted to give a sense of the extended conflict between Dillinger and the government agents, to lend depth, and to heighten tension.Marion Cotillard as Dillinger's softly wide-eyed lover, Billie Freschette, is the perfect pairing with Depp's piercingly intense portrayal of Dillinger.  The two together push the rest of the cast into the background.I found the film to be brilliant in all its aspects.  Johnny Depp is a genius, and even if the film had no other redeeming factors (which it does, in plenty) his performance has ample merit to warrant the five star rating.",5,"Oh, Johnny!",1263772800,"01 18, 2010",2010,1745,"['Other', 'reviews', 'negative', 'ones', 'fault', 'movie', 'overly', 'quiet', 'mumbled', 'dialogue', 'quality', 'filming', 'dragging', 'plot', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'Here', 'take:1', 'quiet', 'dialogue', 'was', 'counterpoint', 'raging', 'violence', 'thus', 'intensifying', 'had', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'dialogue', 'similarity', 'tone', 'Depp', 'Bale', 'pointed', 'out', 'similarities', 'differences', 'character', 'well', 'helping', 'blur', 'distinctions', 'inner', 'workings', 'lawmen', 'lawless', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'monotone', 'was', 'ideal', 'showing', 'singleminded', 'intensity', 'Purvis', 'pursued', 'Dillinger', 'Depp', 'low', 'voice', 'Dillinger', 'stood', 'stark', 'contrast', 'violence', 'was', 'willing', 'wreak.2', 'filming', 'seemed', 'keeping', 'era', 'being', 'portrayed', 'falling', 'almost', 'sepia', 'tones', 'times', 'having', 'film', 'noir', 'quality', 'perfect', 'subject', 'matter', 'jerky', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'viewer', 'impression', 'one', 'watching', 'newsreel', 'action', 'sense', 'viewer', 'participation', 'are', 'there', 'quality', 'wished', 'could', 'duck', 'something', 'too', 'bullets', 'were', 'zinging', 'past.3', 'plot', 'was', 'protracted', 'give', 'sense', 'extended', 'conflict', 'Dillinger', 'government', 'agents', 'lend', 'depth', 'heighten', 'tension.Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Dillinger', 'softly', 'wide-eyed', 'lover', 'Billie', 'Freschette', 'perfect', 'pairing', 'Depp', 'piercingly', 'intense', 'portrayal', 'Dillinger', 'two', 'together', 'rest', 'cast', 'background.I', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'brilliant', 'aspects', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'genius', 'even', 'film', 'had', 'other', 'redeeming', 'factors', 'plenty', 'performance', 'ample', 'merit', 'warrant', 'five', 'star', 'rating']",Public Enemies

Second to see all those period cars my father loved & drove in his youth. I'm not one much for the modern gangster movies depicting the 30's. But this one is big stuff & action movies of this scale on the big screen are worth it. Authenticity is important to the producers & minor slip-ups are noticed truthfully by only a few people. Citing previous movies doesn't really count. No spoiler warnings here. It's sort of like the Titanic, we know what happens. It's the details getting there that make a good movie. This one is, albeit a incomplete one. Johnny Depp is impressive as Dillinger, idolized in the dirt poor depression mid-west. Seen by some as a modern Robin Hood. He took from rich but didn't actually give to the poor. But he didn't rob them either. His daring escape from jail, however accurate, only added to his legend. Better was his girl friend Billie Frechette. Played by Marian Cotillard, she is still somewhat unknown, but very accomplished. He was an out of step bank robber & lets not forget, killer. He was old school even for those days. He & several others were a thorn in the side of the mob, organized crime who of course, victimized anybody. They were complicite in his demise.

1283889,A2BEPH0GY8531W,B002QEHPQA,"John R. Dizon ""John Reinhard Dizon""","[0, 0]","Highly reminiscent of director Michael Mann's ham-fisted effort in translating Stephen Harris' Red Dragon into his box-office bomb Manhunter, this flick deserves considerable mention as Worst Book Adaptation of the Decade. Handled by a less self-indulgent director with a broader vision, this could have easily been the Oscar contender that both Johnny Depp and Christian Bale had hoped for. Instead, we got another well-done Dillinger flick with a screenplay that unfortunately catered only to Depp's anti-hero worship of the major protagonist.For those who read Bryan Burroughs' landmark epic, Public Enemies was one of the greatest crime narratives ever written. Succinctly subtitled 'America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI 1933-34', it was a panoramic view of an unprecedented time in our nation's history, picking up where antebellum bank robbers such as the James-Younger Gang left off. Though undoubtedly John Dillinger was the rock star with the flamboyant style fastidiously portrayed by Depp, there was also Bonnie and Clyde (whose own biopic didn't do badly a generation ago), the Karpis-Barker Gang, Pretty Boy Floyd (who lasted two minutes in this one), and Baby Face Nelson (who gets the honorable mention by Mann). If this would have gotten a Syriana-type treatment with the flashbacks and switch-tos that Burroughs must have been thinking of when he wrote this saga, we might've had a contender for Best Picture of the Decade, alack and alas.Not that Johnny Depp didn't do a bang-up job as Public Enemy Number One, a role that the Pirate of the Caribbean had long coveted. He probably deserves kudos for the best Dillinger portrayal, but you can't do a whole lot with a worn and weary script. Mann should've called John Milius for advice: his own 1973 Dillinger starring Warren Oates was an awesome flick but, as he learned, Dillinger just doesn't go over big at the box office. Even Lawrence Tierney could've told him that. Oscar winner Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis and Award-winner Marion Cotillard as Billie Frechette added star appeal but you just can't make a good meat loaf out of spam.The flick appropriately starts off like gangbusters as Dillinger's gang busts him out of jail, while Purvis murders Pretty Boy Floyd as Hoover announces his career-making War on Crime. Shortly afterwards, the flick deflates as a series of introspections shows Dillinger to be a ne'er-do-well country boy with a head full of corn flakes. Bale tries to make the save as a tortured Special Agent trying to deal with Hoover's flagrant violations of the gangsters' Constitutional rights. Yet Mann drives this Titanic directly into the iceberg as the agents proceed to beat the snot out of the captured Billie in trying to discover Johnny's whereabouts. Women-beaters aren't big box-office, even if it's as great a flick as Raging Bull. We next proceed to the shootout at Little Bohemia, and when Mann fails to get his facts straight in killing off Baby Face Nelson, well, as we have seen, even Batman couldn't save this one.The glaring omissions and greatest disappointment was not seeing the other death stars spotlighted by Burroughs' book. No one has revisited the Bonnie and Clyde saga since Warren Beatty, and a couple of quick switchovers might have worked wonders. Shooting Pretty Boy Floyd at the beginning of the movie was tantamount to Mann shooting himself in the foot, and obfuscating the Karpis-Barker Gang as bit players was probably the worst mistake of all. The cerebral Karpis was the last Public Enemy Number One, and he masterminded kidnappings and armed robberies that grossed twice the other yeggs' combined totals. The Devil's greatest achievement, it is said, is making people believe he doesn't exist. Most people don't know who Alvin Karpis is, and Mann might've set the record straight if he'd only got the story right.For Depp, Bale and Cotillard fans, this is a solid effort for which these actors deserve recognition for putting over a registered stink bomb. For Michael Mann watchers, this ranks right up there with Manhunter as a classic book-to-movie fumble. For crime buffs and action/adventure flick fans, well, let's say this is better than Boys In The Hood...but not much.Public Enemies (Single-Disc Edition)",2,Worst Film Adaptation of the Decade?,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",2013,4266,"['Highly', 'reminiscent', 'director', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'ham-fisted', 'effort', 'translating', 'Stephen', 'Harris', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'box-office', 'bomb', 'Manhunter', 'flick', 'considerable', 'mention', 'Worst', 'Book', 'Adaptation', 'Decade', 'Handled', 'less', 'self-indulgent', 'director', 'broader', 'vision', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'had', 'hoped', 'Instead', 'got', 'well-done', 'Dillinger', 'flick', 'screenplay', 'unfortunately', 'catered', 'only', 'Depp', 'anti-hero', 'worship', 'major', 'protagonist.For', 'who', 'read', 'Bryan', 'Burroughs', 'landmark', 'epic', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'crime', 'narratives', 'ever', 'written', 'Succinctly', 'subtitled', 'Greatest', 'Crime', 'Wave', 'Birth', 'FBI', '1933-34', 'was', 'panoramic', 'view', 'unprecedented', 'time', 'nation', 'history', 'picking', 'up', 'where', 'antebellum', 'bank', 'robbers', 'such', 'James-Younger', 'Gang', 'left', 'off', 'undoubtedly', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'was', 'rock', 'star', 'flamboyant', 'style', 'fastidiously', 'portrayed', 'Depp', 'was', 'also', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'own', 'biopic', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'badly', 'generation', 'ago', 'Karpis-Barker', 'Gang', 'Pretty', 'Boy', 'Floyd', 'who', 'lasted', 'two', 'minutes', 'one', 'Baby', 'Face', 'Nelson', 'who', 'honorable', 'mention', 'Mann', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'Syriana-type', 'treatment', 'flashbacks', 'switch-tos', 'Burroughs', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'thinking', 'when', 'wrote', 'saga', 'might', ""'ve"", 'had', 'contender', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Decade', 'alack', 'alas.Not', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'bang-up', 'job', 'Public', 'Enemy', 'Number', 'One', 'role', 'Pirate', 'Caribbean', 'had', 'long', 'coveted', 'probably', 'kudos', 'best', 'Dillinger', 'portrayal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'worn', 'weary', 'script', 'Mann', 'should', ""'ve"", 'called', 'John', 'Milius', 'advice', 'own', '1973', 'Dillinger', 'starring', 'Warren', 'Oates', 'was', 'awesome', 'flick', 'learned', 'Dillinger', 'just', ""n't"", 'go', 'over', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'Even', 'Lawrence', 'Tierney', 'could', ""'ve"", 'told', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'Award-winner', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Billie', 'Frechette', 'added', 'star', 'appeal', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'meat', 'spam.The', 'flick', 'appropriately', 'like', 'gangbusters', 'Dillinger', 'gang', 'jail', 'Purvis', 'murders', 'Pretty', 'Boy', 'Floyd', 'Hoover', 'career-making', 'War', 'Crime', 'Shortly', 'afterwards', 'flick', 'series', 'introspections', 'shows', 'Dillinger', 'be', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'country', 'boy', 'head', 'full', 'corn', 'flakes', 'Bale', 'make', 'save', 'tortured', 'Special', 'Agent', 'trying', 'deal', 'Hoover', 'flagrant', 'violations', 'gangsters', 'Constitutional', 'rights', 'Mann', 'Titanic', 'directly', 'iceberg', 'agents', 'proceed', 'beat', 'snot', 'captured', 'Billie', 'trying', 'discover', 'Johnny', 'whereabouts', 'Women-beaters', 'are', ""n't"", 'big', 'box-office', 'even', 'as', 'great', 'flick', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'next', 'proceed', 'shootout', 'Little', 'Bohemia', 'when', 'Mann', 'get', 'facts', 'straight', 'killing', 'off', 'Baby', 'Face', 'Nelson', 'well', 'have', 'seen', 'even', 'Batman', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'one.The', 'glaring', 'omissions', 'greatest', 'disappointment', 'was', 'not', 'seeing', 'other', 'death', 'stars', 'spotlighted', 'Burroughs', 'book', 'one', 'revisited', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'saga', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'couple', 'quick', 'switchovers', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'wonders', 'Shooting', 'Pretty', 'Boy', 'Floyd', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'tantamount', 'Mann', 'shooting', 'foot', 'obfuscating', 'Karpis-Barker', 'Gang', 'bit', 'players', 'was', 'probably', 'worst', 'mistake', 'cerebral', 'Karpis', 'was', 'last', 'Public', 'Enemy', 'Number', 'One', 'masterminded', 'kidnappings', 'armed', 'robberies', 'grossed', 'twice', 'other', 'yeggs', 'combined', 'totals', 'Devil', 'greatest', 'achievement', 'said', 'making', 'people', 'believe', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Alvin', 'Karpis', 'Mann', 'might', ""'ve"", 'set', 'record', 'straight', ""'d"", 'only', 'got', 'story', 'right.For', 'Depp', 'Bale', 'Cotillard', 'fans', 'solid', 'effort', 'actors', 'deserve', 'recognition', 'putting', 'over', 'registered', 'stink', 'bomb', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'watchers', 'ranks', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Manhunter', 'classic', 'book-to-movie', 'fumble', 'crime', 'buffs', 'action/adventure', 'flick', 'fans', 'well', 'let', 'say', 'better', 'Boys', 'Hood', 'not', 'much.Public', 'Enemies', 'Single-Disc', 'Edition']",Public Enemies

By the end of this film, I was really surprised at how conventional and tired Mann's sensibility was.  Another movie romanticizing (albeit in grave, heavy-handed style) the lives of Dillinger and co.?  It's like he took one of those 30s gangster flicks, gussied it up with moody atmosphere, packed it with an all-star cast, and yet drained it of energy and flair and excitement--to accomplish what?  There's no new perspective on these lives, no kind of modern, edgier take on Dillinger, or any kind of freshness in the execution. It's the same romanticized vision of these anti-heroes we've seen time and again (and Mann's already done before). The whole movie feels stale and plodding for its 2 1/2 hour duration.  I also dislike Mann's recent use of digital video to shoot his films--this one has a dull, flat look that just adds to the lugubrious feel.  Mann still knows how to stage the action scenes, and he gets good performances out of his actors, but the pop sensibility, the fun slickness of style, and the excitement of Mann's earlier work has disappeared without any compensatory maturing of themes or film-making craft.

1283895,AO80ZID761BZH,B002QEHPQA,Joseph_,"[4, 5]","I had heard of John Dillinger vaguely before renting this movie, and mainly, the only reason I gave it a shot was because of Johnny Depp, who acts in the main role as the infamous criminal. I consider him to be one of the most brilliant actors of our generation, and I usually love his movies. But I wasn't struck with an enjoyment when watching ""Public Enemies"". I was actually disappointed.The biggest reason I didn't enjoy this movie was because of the way it was filmed. Most movies have a much crisper quality about them, but the film used to portray John's story is grainy and strange to watch. It's almost like watching someone film a movie with a video recorder from Best Buy; some people might like this unique approach to filming, but I think it takes away from the power of a movie.Coming in a close second is the fact that this movie is remarkably plot-less. The story is a little confusing, and the flat story-line, as well as dialog that didn't spring life into the tale, was disappointing. For most of the film, I sat, bored, and usually skipped to better scenes. There is little action, and the climax is hardly engaging.However, with my negative opinions aside, there are a few things that make this movie decent, and worth a watch. Johnny Depp is still an excellent actor, portraying the life of the dead criminal as well as he could. Christian Bale also makes a strong opponent to Johnny's character; though it's hard to see anyone but Batman when I see Christian, it was enjoyable to  watch him. Finally, the love between Johnny's character, Dillinger, and the girl he finds, Billie, is very touching. Based on a real criminal and a real relationship, they create a very tortured, but honest connection, and that alone made this movie a bit better.So if you're reading this, and trying to decide if you should bother watching ""Public Enemies"", I insist you watch it just to get your own opinion.

Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup), Dillinger and his band of criminals engage in a seemingly never-ending game of cat and mouse with government agents led by Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale). As the game escalates even further, it becomes increasingly clear that a deadly final showdown between the law and the lawless is inescapable.This film, ""Public Enemies"", is the eighth attempt at brining Dillinger's story to life. After so many previous versions one can't help but wonder, ""What could Michael Mann's newest iteration of the outlaw's tale possibly have to say that hasn't already been said?""For starters, this version of John Dillinger and his criminal exploits is more historically accurate than anything previously done; although, that's not to say that this one isn't without its share of fallacies (in truth there are numerous ones). Written by Ronan Bennet, Michael Mann, and Ann Biderman (""Primal Fear"") the story plays out similarly to Mann's previous heist film, ""Heat""; however, despite the similarities in pacing and structure, the film doesn't feel like a retread. Unlike, ""Heat"" which was a character driven heist drama, this film is almost 100% a character study. While there are several bank heist sequences within the movie, the majority of the film is spent on exploring the various aspects of Dillinger's life; from his loves to his own criminal moral code (yes, he does have a code he lives by) to his relationship with the media and the common man. Truth be told, had this film not focused more on the person rather than the crimes then it wouldn't have been nearly as engaging, because at that point it becomes just another heist movie.While I enjoyed the examination of John Dillinger's life, there were moments of the film that could have been edited out to make the pacing flow better. Several times throughout some of the scenes between Dillinger and Billie (his lover), and other scenes not featuring those two, the story begins to slow to a crawl. I believe Michael Mann and his editing team should have noticed this problem and been more judicious in their cuts; therefore removing those lulls in the story. Had this happened then the movie would have been much tighter, potentially more engaging for the audience (given that too many lulls can cause interest to wane), and brought the running time down closer to the two hour mark which most audience members seem to prefer. That's not to say that because of these pacing issues that I didn't enjoy the movie, I still enjoyed it, I just recognize that there are ways it could have been made better.Of course, when dealing with an historical drama, one must discuss the accuracy of events being depicted or lack thereof, whatever the case may be. In this instance, the screenplay stays close to the realm of historical fact, but there are several instances where creative license comes into play for a more dramatic effect or the film just blatantly rearranges events from history to suit its needs.The creative license is most prominently on display during a scene around the middle of the film where FBI agent Melvin Purvis meets John Dillinger for the first time. According to commonly accepted history; these two men never formally met each other. Although the scene is pivotal within the cat-and-mouse game being played by the two men; the fact that it never happened and was added in for dramatic purposes is frustrating when watching a film one presumes to be based on fact. Plus, the timing of the scene within the movie lends some credence to the comparison being drawn between this film and ""Heat"", as the two main characters in that film first meet in a key scene around the middle of that movie as well.Other problems within the film's storyline would be the noticeable inaccuracies surrounding numerous murders. A few key plot points within the film hinge upon the deaths of certain individuals; however, their deaths either don't occur in the manner depicted or within the timeframe being referenced. Another area of contention for some is whether or not John Dillinger actually had a romance with Billie Frechette. While the depiction of the romance within the film is not necessarily inaccurate, it's also not a concrete fact.While the film is steeped mostly in fact and presents the most historically accurate account of John Dillinger's criminal life, I find myself disappointed by some of the decisions made for dramatic purposes within the story. To me, if you're going to make a movie based on an actual person that references other actual people and events, then do not modify history to suit your needs. Instead, present the story as accurately as possible with only minor creative license being employed for the areas that are not completely certain in history's eyes.I understand that many historical dramas contain numerous inaccuracies in order to create a more dramatic piece of cinema (to be honest, I thoroughly enjoy many of them). Although, whether I enjoy the film or not, the facts should not be ignored, rearranged, or manipulated in excess. I admit that I enjoy ""Public Enemies"", but I must acknowledge that the inconsistencies between the film and reality do detract from my overall enjoyment.An area that excels despite the historical inaccuracies, and does the best it can as far as actual likenesses go, is the film's casting. No matter what the subject matter, whenever Michael Mann sets out to make a film he always manages to attract A-list talent and this movie is no exception.Leading the cast is the chameleon-like Johnny Depp (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy), playing what could be considered his most normal role, in terms of appearance and mannerisms, in years. Depp exudes throughout the film all of the confidence, charm, and charisma that helped make John Dillinger into one of the most popular criminals (among the people) of all time. Even when brandishing a loaded weapon while robbing a bank, John's moral code allowed him to be continually viewed as a Robin Hood of sorts. This strange dichotomy of a man, seen as both hero and villain, would be a complicated role to undertake, yet Depp plays the duality that comprises John Dillinger effortlessly. With this role, Johnny Depp proves once more why he is one of the best actors of his generation.In the main supporting roles are two equally impressive talents, Christian Bale (""The Dark Knight"") as FBI agent Melvin Purvis and actress Marion Cotillard (""La Vie en Rose"") as Billie Frechette. Christian Bale adopts another American accent yet again, but there did seem to be some minor wavering in the accent's consistency throughout the movie. Purvis has a slight southern drawl, which is different from the typical American accent Bale usually adopts (as seen in ""The Dark Knight""). Perhaps, adding the southern inflection made the accent more difficult to master. Despite the small drawback (it wasn't much at all); Christian still delivered an excellent performance that easily stands toe-to-toe with Johnny Depp's.Academy Award winning actress Marion Cotillard portrays John Dillinger's supposed lover, Billie Frechette. Marion conveys such grace, warmth, and strength that she is instantly captivating in the surprisingly complicated role. In the beginning Billie is the quiet girl who is unsure of this charismatic man who has taken an interest in her; however, once she starts to immerse herself into Dillinger's world she quickly shows the inner strength that had been laying in wait. Just like Johnny Depp's role of John Dillinger was filled with duality and complexity, Billie offered Marion nearly the same challenges and she easily rose to meet them. Of course, one would expect nothing less from this Academy Award winning actress.Lastly, actor Billy Crudup (""Watchmen"") shows up in several scenes (amounting to nothing more than an extended cameo) as FBI Director, J. Edgar Hoover. Billy is a consistently reliable actor who has never really broken through in popularity despite roles in high-profile films, such as ""Mission: Impossible 3"" and ""Watchmen"". Even with Billy's consistent track record of performances, I feel that his portrayal in this film is too flat and ultimately ineffective, making Hoover appear completely uninteresting and uncharismatic. While there doesn't appear to be a definitive consensus on just how charismatic J. Edgar Hoover truly was or wasn't in reality. By my estimation, if a man can amass the level of power and influence Hoover did, he wouldn't be able to do so if he was anything remotely resembling the depiction in this film.In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Public Enemies"" despite the brief lulls and slightly overlong run time; however, the historical inaccuracies lower my opinion of this film to an extent. If you ask me, historical inaccuracies to this degree (which is quite substantial in some instances) should never be allowed no matter how beneficial they may be to the overall dramatic narrative.""Public Enemies"" is rated R for violence and language.",3,Historical Inaccuracies Are This Film's #1 Enemy...,1261785600,"12 26, 2009",2009,9586,"['John', 'Dillinger', 'one', 'most',

1283898,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B002QEHPQA,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[3, 4]","Michael Mann's Public Enemies is a realistic look at the last year of John Dillinger's life.Johnny Depp is Dillinger, a charming, dashing but totally ruthless bank robber. There is no romanticization here, either of Dillinger or criminals, such as in Mann's Heat. The gun battles in Public Enemies are life and death, the blood, dark and visceral. In between robberies Dillinger hides in plain sight in Chicago. Dillinger pays the mob for safe passage, and safe houses, and the police don`t seem to notice. We never learn more about Dillinger than he wants to tell us. When he's wooing Billie Frenchette (Marion Cotillard) and she wants to know he is, he tells her ""I was born in Morrisville, Indiana, my mother died when I was three, my father hit me because he knew no other way to raise me, I like expensive clothes, and fast cars.""Depp plays Dillinger as the existential man, not making any plans for the future and he's free to go wherever he pleases. The irony of that he chooses locales familiar to him. Dillinger is a much different type of pirate than (Capt) Jack Sparrow. Dillinger is remorseless, unflinching, and not about to allow anyone to get in his way. Dillinger sees friends killed by cops, he kills police, and beats people who are a little too slow in opening a bank safe, or are in his way in the moment he's trying to obtain something whether it be money or women. The only little bit of regret we see expressed is when Billie gets arrested and Dillinger can`t do anything to rescue her.Christian Bale plays Melvin Purvis, in a nicely understated role for him, no seething anger of Batman or John Connor. Purvis gets about the same amount of screen time as Depp's Dillinger. J Edgar Hoover, played by Billy Crudup who absolutely melts into the role, is at a crossroads, his Bureau of Investigation isn't yet the Federal Bureau of Investigation that we know today, and he needs to convince Congress that his Bureau is professional and warrants the budgets he's asking for. Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, and of course the Chicago mob are all making Hoover and his Bureau look inept at best. He transfers Purvis to Chicago to get results, but Hoover's Bureau of clean cut professionals have no practical experience catching criminals and soon they adopt questionable tactics, starting gun battles in the street with innocent bystanders caught in the middle, torturing witnesses, and in the end they don't try to arrest Dillinger they gun him down in the streets of Chicago. I think it is interesting the movie is titled Public Enemies in the plural, is the unstated message that law enforcement were as bad as the law breakers?Dillinger had the protection of the Chicago mob which provided connections for fast cars, safe houses, and guns and ammunition that outgunned law enforcement. That is, until Dillinger got too ""popular"" and started drawing federal attention to the mob who viewed Dillinger's proceeds as small time compared to the ""river of money they were bringing in which got wider and deeper by the day."" Arrangements are made to betray Dillinger and get Hoover's Bureau of Investigation off their backs.I was born and raised in Chicago and the degree of realism portrayed in Public Enemies is amazing. I saw echoes of Dillinger's world when I was growing up and scenes such as in Union Station and it's icy marble smoothness, and the iron shoe shine stands I remember, even the `L' trains are the ones I remember from the 60's.Gangsters and movies seem to be a place where art and life meet. Gangsters and their exploits became fodder for Hollywood, and the gangsters saw their reflections in the movies. Dillinger's last act was to see the movie Manhattan Melodrama, and perhaps the movies fed their egos and the ""performances"" during their crime sprees. Dillinger famously told people in the banks he was robbing to keep their money he didn't want it, he only wanted the banks money, building a Robin Hood reputation. And before Purvis kills Baby Face Nelson in a shoot-out, Nelson is seen doing a James Cagney impression. I think by far Public Enemies is the best of the summer blockbuster movies, successfully melding action with a believable and dramatic human element.",4,Best of Summer Blockbuster Movies!,1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,4224,"['Michael', 'Mann', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'realistic', 'look', 'last', 'year', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'life.Johnny', 'Depp', 'Dillinger', 'charming', 'dashing', 'totally', 'ruthless', 'bank', 'robber', 'romanticization', 'here', 'Dillinger', 'criminals', 'such', 'Mann', 'Heat', 'gun', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'are', 'life', 'death', 'blood', 'dark', 'visceral', 'robberies', 'Dillinger', 'hides', 'plain', 'sight', 'Chicago', 'Dillinger', 'mob', 'safe', 'passage', 'safe', 'houses', 'police', 'don', 't', 'seem', 'notice', 'never', 'learn', 'more', 'Dillinger', 'tell', 'When', 'wooing', 'Billie', 'Frenchette', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'know', 'was', 'born', 'Morrisville', 'Indiana', 'mother', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'three', 'father', 'hit', 'knew', 'other', 'way', 'raise', 'like', 'expensive', 'clothes', 'fast', 'cars', 'Depp', 'Dillinger', 'existential', 'man', 'not', 'making', 'plans', 'future', 'free', 'go', 'wherever', 'irony', 'locales', 'familiar', 'Dillinger', 'much', 'different', 'type', 'pirate', 'Capt', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'Dillinger', 'remorseless', 'unflinching', 'not', 'allow', 'anyone', 'get', 'way', 'Dillinger', 'friends', 'killed', 'cops', 'police', 'beats', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'slow', 'opening', 'bank', 'safe', 'are', 'way', 'moment', 'trying', 'obtain', 'something', 'be', 'money', 'women', 'only', 'little', 'bit', 'regret', 'see', 'expressed', 'when', 'Billie', 'arrested', 'Dillinger', 'can', 't', 'do', 'anything', 'rescue', 'her.Christian', 'Bale', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'nicely', 'understated', 'role', 'seething', 'anger', 'Batman', 'John', 'Connor', 'Purvis', 'same', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'Depp', 'Dillinger', 'J', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'played', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'who', 'absolutely', 'melts', 'role', 'crossroads', 'Bureau', 'Investigation', ""n't"", 'yet', 'Federal', 'Bureau', 'Investigation', 'know', 'today', 'convince', 'Congress', 'Bureau', 'professional', 'warrants', 'budgets', 'asking', 'Dillinger', 'Pretty', 'Boy', 'Floyd', 'Baby', 'Face', 'Nelson', 'course', 'Chicago', 'mob', 'are', 'making', 'Hoover', 'Bureau', 'look', 'inept', 'best', 'Purvis', 'Chicago', 'get', 'results', 'Hoover', 'Bureau', 'clean', 'cut', 'professionals', 'have', 'practical', 'experience', 'catching', 'criminals', 'soon', 'adopt', 'questionable', 'tactics', 'starting', 'gun', 'battles', 'street', 'innocent', 'bystanders', 'caught', 'middle', 'torturing', 'witnesses', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'arrest', 'Dillinger', 'gun', 'down', 'streets', 'Chicago', 'think', 'interesting', 'movie', 'titled', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'plural', 'unstated', 'message', 'law', 'enforcement', 'were', 'as', 'bad', 'law', 'breakers', 'Dillinger', 'had', 'protection', 'Chicago', 'mob', 'provided', 'connections', 'fast', 'cars', 'safe', 'houses', 'guns', 'ammunition', 'outgunned', 'law', 'enforcement', 'Dillinger', 'got', 'too', 'popular', 'started', 'drawing', 'federal', 'attention', 'mob', 'who', 'viewed', 'Dillinger', 'proceeds', 'small', 'time', 'compared', 'river', 'money', 'were', 'bringing', 'got', 'wider', 'deeper', 'day', 'Arrangements', 'are', 'made', 'betray', 'Dillinger', 'get', 'Hoover', 'Bureau', 'Investigation', 'backs.I', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'Chicago', 'degree', 'realism', 'portrayed', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'amazing', 'saw', 'echoes', 'Dillinger', 'world', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'scenes', 'such', 'Union', 'Station', 'icy', 'marble', 'smoothness', 'iron', 'shoe', 'shine', 'remember', 'even', 'L', 'trains', 'are', 'ones', 'remember', ""60's.Gangsters"", 'movies', 'seem', 'be', 'place', 'where', 'art', 'life', 'meet', 'Gangsters', 'exploits', 'became', 'fodder', 'Hollywood', 'gangsters', 'saw', 'reflections', 'movies', 'Dillinger', 'last', 'act', 'was', 'see', 'movie', 'Manhattan', 'Melodrama', 'perhaps', 'movies', 'fed', 'egos', 'performances', 'crime', 'sprees', 'Dillinger', 'famously', 'told', 'people', 'banks', 'was', 'robbing', 'keep', 'money', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'only', 'wanted', 'banks', 'money', 'building', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'reputation', 'Purvis', 'kills', 'Baby', 'Face', 'Nelson', 'shoot-out', 'Nelson', 'seen', 'doing', 'James', 'Cagney', 'impression', 'think', 'far', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'best', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'movies', 'successfully', 'melding', 'action', 'believable', 'dramatic', 'human', 'element']",Public Enemies

No jail could hold him. His charm and audacious jailbreaks endeared him to almost everyone -- from his girlfriend Billie Frechette to an American public who had no sympathy for the banks that had plunged the country into the Depression. But while the adventures of Dillinger's gang -- later including Baby Face Nelson and Alvin Karpis -- thrilled many, J. Edgar Hoover made Dillinger America's first Public Enemy Number One and sent in Melvin Purvis, the dashing ""Clark Gable of the FBI."" However, Dillinger and his gang outwitted and outgunned Purvis' men in wild chases and shootouts. Only after importing a crew of Western ex-lawmen (newly baptized as agents) and orchestrating epic betrayals -- from the infamous ""Lady in Red"" to the Chicago crime boss Frank Nitti -- were Purvis, the FBI and their new crew of gunfighters able to close in on Dillinger.The cast led by Johnny Depp (in an Oscar-caliber performance as John Dillinger), Christian Bale (as Melvin Purvis), & Marion Cotillard (as Billie Frechette) is excellent! The directing by Michael Mann (also co-wrote the screenplay and produced) (who also directed ""Heat"" (1995, also produced and wrote the story and screenplay), ""Collateral"" (2004, also produced), ""Miami Vice"" (2006, also produced and wrote the story and screenplay), ""Manhunter"" (1986, also wrote the screenplay), ""Ali"" (2001, also wrote the screenplay and produced), ""The Insider"" (1999, also wrote the story and screenplay and produced) & ""The Last Of The Mohicans"" (1992, also wrote the screenplay and produced) is excellent!

And I was not disappointed. I'm surprised by all the negative reviews. Even my sister who dislikes long movies and period pieces thought it was great.Public Enemies is certainly remniscent of an old movie. The costumes, sets, and mood capture the period spot on. Just the cinematography itself was stunning. The plot doesn't serve up the story on a silver platter for you like most new releases; it meanders and allows the movie goer to think. This movie is not a biography of John Dillinger. Rather it is a snapshot of one of crimes' wildest years: 1933-1934. Johnny Depp brings an intensity to Dillinger that is hard to put into words. (And looks incredibly handsome doing it.) Christian Bale plays FBI agent Purvis very well. I don't think anyone in the theatre was rooting for the ""good"" guy. Marion Cottiliard does a superb job as Billie, Dillinger's girlfriend. The romance between the two characters was very convincing. The gun battles were very intense and done well. Diana Krall has a wonderful cameo that makes the soundtrack worth buying in itself.The other thing that made this movie for me was how the suspense builds to a great crescendo. You know that Dillinger will ultimately be gunned down by the FBI agents and the director did an excellent job pacing the ending.Perhaps because I had read the book prior to seeing the movie the lack of biography did not bother me.

1283910,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B002QEHPQA,Linda Linguvic,"[1, 2]","Brash and bold, and shot it hi-def digital, this version of the John Dillinger story brings the 1930's alive to a modern audience.  In 1933, the depression was in its fourth year and people were poor. They hated the banks and bankers and bank robbers were romanticized. Also, the FBI was in its early beginnings then and needed to prove itself.  This film captures the time and the place and it does this by use of great film editing using intense close ups and expressionistic camerawork. This keeps the story fresh and kept my eyes glued to the screen. The music also captures the tone of the times.  And there is one nightclub scene where Diana Krall does a great rendition of ""Bye Bye Blackbird"".John Depp plays Dillinger as cool and focused.  Bank robbing is what he does.  He's good at it and knows it.  In the opening sequence we meet him busting his gang out of an Indiana prison.  It's violent all the way and I could feel myself wincing at every bare-knuckled punch and gunshot.  Later, we see the gang robbing a bank and some of the overhead shots make it all seem like choreography.  Dillinger's love interest is Billie, played by Marion Cotillard.  She is swept away by his personality and his adoration of her.  Soon they are lovers.Christian Bale plays the FBI agent, Melvin Pruvis.  He is determined to get Dillinger and his understated seething anger is played with a sinister determination.  He is out to get his man at any cost, and there is a scene where he threatens a madam, Anna Sage, with deportation to her native Romania if she doesn't point out Dillinger as they come out of a movie theater.  Later, she was thought of as ""the woman in red"" although she actually wore an orange skirt with a white blouse.  Later, I was disappointed that there was no mention of what happened to her later.

1283921,A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ,B002QEHPQA,Michael A. Coluccio,"[21, 37]","...and I've seen my fair share, believe me. Director Michael Mann really blew a golden opportunity to produce an epic film about one of the most celebrated bank robbers in the annals of American crime.  During what was probably the longest two-plus hours of my life, I found myself alternately squirming in my seat, checking my wrist watch at fifteen-minute intervals, and even dozing off, only to be awakened by the sound of gunfire from the theater's surround sound system.  The only reason I subjected myself to this torture was in the vain hope that it would get better (it did not).  Johnny Depp, in my opinion, is a gifted, versatile actor, but his portrayal of the lead character was way off the mark.  The real Dillinger, by all accounts, was a likeable rogue who didn't take life too seriously, unlike Depp's portrayal of brooding intensity.  Moreover, Dillinger's sweetheart, Evelyn ""Billie"" Frechette, was in reality a foul-mouthed, promiscuous, hard-partying good-time girl with a penchant for bootleg booze, in sharp contrast to the subdued low-key character depicted by Marion Cottilard.  There is even one ridiculous scene in which Dillinger, barely disguised only in a pair of sunlasses,  accompanies his new girl friend, Polly Hamilton, to a Chicago police station.  While there, he leisurely wanders about the offices of the precinct's ""Dillinger Squad"" unmolested, taking everything in, while a group of cops are standing around a radio mesmerized by a baseball game.  I could go on and on, but why bother pointing out all of the negatives?  Do yourselves a favor and skip this train wreck.  On second thought, perhaps this film is salvageable, after all, as an antidote to sleeplessness.  If you're suffering a bout with insomnia, I strongly advise you to see ""Public Enemies.""  It will knock you out faster than a sleeping pill.

1283926,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B002QEHPQA,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 5]","On the surface, Public Enemies seems to be about bank robbers.  But it's actually about the triumphs and travails of celebrities in a time of great upheaval - which is to say, it's about Hollywood today.Johnny Depp, playing Dillinger, is charismatic, masculine, bold, even reckless.  He seems unwilling to admit that his lifestyle is a dead-end, preferring instead to live in the moment.  And yet he seeks human companionship in Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard), swooping in to claim her as his ""girl"" without really asking her permission.  He is a titan among men, striding into her humdrum life to sweep Billie off her heels and, throwing caution to the wind, seek his own fortune.Christian Bale, playing Special Agent Melvin Purvis, is the man tasked with taking Dillinger down.  He navigates the world of public opinion and the bumbling incompetency of a young FBI task force not yet hardened by adversity.  Purvis has a lot to prove, balancing his own morality with a new era of government ruthlessness.This movie isn't really about facts, though.  A trip through Wikipedia shows the number of liberties - and there are many - that the movie took with actual events.  Instead, Michael Mann tries to craft a narrative out of the battle between these two sides, creating the classic duality where two actors at the top of their game face off.Purvis is the principled, dark, brooding character that bucks authority and follows his own noble path by being smarter and more dedicated than the authorities in charge.  Dillinger is the wild man that criminals turn to, pushed to the edge because of the Great Depression and the law.  Both men have nothing to lose but their very souls.  If this sounds familiar, it's pretty much the same plot as The Dark Knight, only with gangsters instead of comic book villains.For all the great action sequences, close-ups, and monologues, there isn't much we know about the characters in the end.  Without the benefit of a prequel like The Dark Knight, Purvis is as much a cipher as Dillinger.  Missing is the exploration of the environments that helped craft the careers of both men, and it becomes clear that Mann is more interested in making modern analogies (about torture, about wiretapping, and government abuse in general) than sharing a sense of history.And that's the problem.  While Public Enemies retells the tale, more or less, of the rise and fall of Dillinger, it fails to provide the backdrop for why it happened.  We get occasional insights into the evolution of the FBI, but not of public sentiment, of the Great Depression, of how society helped create cops and robbers.  At one point Dillinger provides a veiled reference to his past that's just as cryptic as the Joker's - because it doesn't really matter.  This movie isn't about why things happened; it's more about giving two actors their chance to shine.In that regard Public Enemies is a success.  It's long, filled with philosophical dialogue and occasionally improbable shootouts.

This wasn't because the main character got gunned down, but because it seemed as though the film was a victim of careless disregard.I am very familiar with the storied history behind John Dillinger, the mystique, the popularity and the fanfare...  He was a bad guy and the FBI was on a mission. While this film did not deviate very far from the basic facts, and artistic license was excercised tastefully well, the storyline perhaps held on too tightly to itself with little regard for the audience. Although I knew how the film would end, the journey was not worth the price of admission.Johnny Depp did a fine job in his role, and Christian Bale was adequate. However, from the very first scene I felt lost, as though I had stepped out for a while and come back in after some important scene. Scene to scene this film meandered, stumbled, tripped, sleepwalked, woke up, got lost and generally searched for any continuity, right up until the closing credits. The editor would make a poor bartender... cutting off each customer after only one sip.The pace of the film is painfully slow and glaringly disjointed... even with the requisite violence and explosive, cracklingly loud gun battles, the end result is a snoozer. The flow just isnt there and this is VERY unfortunate. I really WANTED to like this film, but realized after leaving the theatre, that it didnt deliver.Character development was non-existent. There is no background. The viewer is expected to have lived several years of Dillinger's life prior to the film starting.... This film would have made a fair sequel to itself had it been a second offereing to some other production...Rarely am I this critical of a film Ive screened in a theater. I have been lucky to enjoy most every theatrical viewing Ive attended over the last 20 years. This film simply was not up to par.I would highly recommend the 1973 John Milius film 'Dillinger' as required viewing before this film. Milius' film is by no means an Academy Award winner, and in no way would I say it is among the best films ever made, but Warren Oates' performance as John Dillinger is miles beyond Depp's, and Ben Johnson as Melvin Purvis, far more believable than Christian Bale. With a star studded cast, including a young Richard Dreyfuss, Harry Dean Stanton, Michelle Phillips, Cloris Leachman and Geoffrey Lewis, 'Dillinger' was a cult masterpece in a time when filmmaking was undergoing a vast transformation. John Milius put out a fast paced non-stop rollercoaster that did what only a number of films do in a given decade.'Public Enemies' rates a far second to 'Dillinger'...

1283932,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B002QEHPQA,mirasreviews,"[2, 3]","Michael Mann directed and co-wrote ""Public Enemies"", drawing on Bryan Burrough's book ""Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34"" to follow John Dillinger's 1933-1934 crime spree and the hunt to bring him to justice. In the depths of the Great Depression, bank robbers have become folk heroes in the eyes of many Americans, and John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) revels in his public image. The Bureau of Investigation in Washington, DC, under the direction of J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup), vows to stop the crime spree. Hoover declares Dillinger ""Public Enemy #1"" and appoints Southern lawman Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) to head a team in Chicago that will capture Dillinger by means of modern technology and old-fashioned ruthlessness.This is classic Michael Mann. ""Public Enemies"" flaunts big guns, fast cars, and stylish suits. Mann has chosen to portray the 1930s with the same edginess and energy as the present, which is in keeping with the film's choice of perspectives: It is about the experiences of two men, Dillinger and Purvis, rather than historical context. To this end, Purvis is somewhat idealized, Dillinger's romance with Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) is given more significance than it probably had, and a lot of dates and details are altered to better serve the character arcs. For example, most of the outlaws who die before Dillinger in the film actually died after him. ""Public Enemies"" is stylish and entertaining, but it's best to take the details with a grain of salt, though the story is true in the general sense.The artistic license didn't bother me. This was the last generation of American outlaws whose exploits captured the public's imagination. Their legacy has always been a hybrid of fact and fiction. I would have preferred more historical context, though. The poverty and unemployment of the Great Depression facilitated John Dillinger's rapid ascent to folk hero status, and the evolving economics of organized crime syndicates did much to bring him down. The writers pay lip service to these forces, but they don't integrate well into the narrative, which tends to focus on personalities and events. Granted, those are more up Michael Mann's alley than history. I just felt that the greater story got the least attention. But the cast is top-notch, and ""Public Enemies"" is enjoyable as a stylish period action film.The DVD (Universal 2009 singe disc): The single disc edition includes one featurette and an audio commentary. ""Larger Than Life: Adversaries"" (10 min) interviews Michael Mann, Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, Melvin Purvis' son Alvin Purvis and others about the real characters of Purvis and Dillinger and the research the actors did. The audio commentary by Michael Mann is constant and informative. He talks about his approach to the material and contributes historical details, including how the Dillinger Gang operated. But he doesn't say what details and events have been altered for the film, which would have been helpful. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, French, Spanish.

Heck, The Last of the Mohicans was as far away from the genre as he could get and it still turned out to be a very good film. I had high hopes going in to see Public Enemies today, especially with such a talent filled cast. Johnny Depp's acting chops are as strong as they have ever been. He doesn't overplay the part and at times seems a little too relaxed, but overall he captures the essence of the character nicely. Christian Bale has been better, but he brings the right amount of quiet intensity to the role of the man assigned with hunting Dillinger down. Marion Cotillard is beautiful here and I thought she did well with what little material she had to work with. I wish they would have gotten into the other characters in the gang a bit more and Billy Crudup as J. Edgar Hoover had less screen time than I thought he would.The pacing is a little slow at times, but there are a few realistic shootout scenes that are well down. A major flaw is that the timeline is out of order (Baby Face Nelson was actually killed after Dillinger is just one example) and it strays from historical truth at times. I can't quite put my finger on why I didn't love this movie. When it ended, I left the theater thinking that I was entertained, but also how forgettable it was.

The story of John Dillinger is told, from the time he was sent back to prison for the second time, through to his ultimate demise.  The movie presents a thief versus dogged pursuing cop in a superficially similar way to Heat, as a mesmerizingly charismatic Johnny Depp as Dillinger, and a glowering Christian Bale as Melvyn Purvis the FBI agent face off against each other.  However, the tale unfolds in a much more traditional and workmanlike fashion than you might expect from Mann's previous work.  The period setting is terrifically presented, as is the rat-a-tat of period armoury.  The script however, tells the story in an orderly fashion, not really delving much into the characters or their motivations.  The only detour into understanding a little about what was going on in Dillinger's head is a detour into the romance between Dillinger and Billie Frechette, which seems neither long enough to do justice to a terrific turn from Marion Cotillard, or brief enough to avoid feeling like it's been uncomfortably shoehorned in.  Christian Bale plays a straight role also, without really ever feeling we understand what drives the man.It's entertaining, and has enough prison breakouts, chases and bank robberies to keep you glued for the slightly lengthy running time.  However, there are some unusual stylistic choices which do not quite work.  Mann has filmed in Hi-Def Digital cameras, eschewing film for the first time.  Period movies shot in film have a warmth and softness to the pallet that `feels right' to the eye.  Digital cameras have a way of making the action real and immediate, certainly, but so real and immediate it begins to feel like reality TV documentary style.  Bright lights burn into the screen, and fast movement feels harsh on the eye in a way that we are used to seeing on the TV screen rather than in a period movie setting.  There are times it works to make the viewer accept what you are seeing as real, and not a construct.  But there are more times when the digital camera artefacts break the fourth wall and you are reminded this IS a movie set and not real, particularly with the directors penchant for hand held camera for even the most static of dialogue scenes.  As a stylistic experiment it is a bold choice - but ultimately one that does not help the movie.  On the plus side, the transfer to Bluray is certainly striking, and you are certainly left feeling you saw the movie as the director intended.So - entertaining, yes.  Interesting document of exploits of one of America's most notorious criminals and the birth of the FBI - yes.  However, as a piece of cinema it is flawed, and not likely to stick in your mind for the right reasons.",3,Flawed but watchable biopic,1267228800,"02 27, 2010",2010,2758,"['Michael', 'Mann', 'latest', 'least', 'as', 'frustrating', 'satisfying', 'story', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'told', 'time', 'was', 'sent', 'back', 'prison', 'second', 'time', 'ultimate', 'demise', 'movie', 'thief', 'versus', 'dogged', 'pursuing', 'cop', 'superficially', 'similar', 'way', 'Heat', 'mesmerizingly', 'charismatic', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Dillinger', 'glowering', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Melvyn', 'Purvis', 'FBI', 'agent', 'face', 'other', 'However', 'tale', 'unfolds', 'much', 'more', 'traditional', 'workmanlike', 'fashion', 'might', 'expect', 'Mann', 'previous', 'work', 'period', 'setting', 'terrifically', 'presented', 'rat-a-tat', 'period', 'armoury', 'script', 'however', 'story', 'orderly', 'fashion', 'not', 'really', 'delving', 'much', 'characters', 'motivations', 'only', 'detour', 'understanding', 'little', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Dillinger', 'head', 'detour', 'romance', 'Dillinger', 'Billie', 'Frechette', 'long', 'enough', 'do', 'justice', 'terrific', 'turn', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'brief', 'enough', 'avoid', 'feeling', 'been', 'uncomfortably', 'shoehorned', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'straight', 'role', 'also', 'really', 'ever', 'feeling', 'understand', 'man.It', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'prison', 'breakouts', 'chases', 'bank', 'robberies', 'keep', 'glued', 'slightly', 'lengthy', 'running', 'time', 'However', 'are', 'unusual', 'stylistic', 'choices', 'do', 'not', 'quite', 'work', 'Mann', 'filmed', 'Hi-Def', 'Digital', 'cameras', 'eschewing', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'Period', 'movies', 'shot', 'film', 'have', 'warmth', 'softness', 'pallet', 'feels', 'right', 'eye', 'Digital', 'cameras', 'have', 'way', 'making', 'action', 'real', 'immediate', 'certainly', 'so', 'real', 'immediate', 'feel', 'reality', 'TV', 'documentary', 'style', 'Bright', 'lights', 'burn', 'screen', 'fast', 'movement', 'feels', 'harsh', 'eye', 'way', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'TV', 'screen', 'rather', 'period', 'movie', 'setting', 'are', 'times', 'make', 'viewer', 'accept', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'real', 'not', 'construct', 'are', 'more', 'times', 'when', 'digital', 'camera', 'break', 'fourth', 'wall', 'are', 'reminded', 'movie', 'set', 'not', 'real', 'particularly', 'directors', 'penchant', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'even', 'most', 'static', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'stylistic', 'experiment', 'bold', 'choice', 'ultimately', 'one', 'not', 'help', 'movie', 'plus', 'side', 'transfer', 'Bluray', 'certainly', 'striking', 'are', 'certainly', 'left', 'feeling', 'saw', 'movie', 'director', 'intended.So', 'entertaining', 'yes', 'Interesting', 'document', 'exploits', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'notorious', 'criminals', 'birth', 'FBI', 'yes', 'However', 'piece', 'cinema', 'flawed', 'not', 'likely', 'stick', 'mind', 'right', 'reasons']",Public Enemies

1283941,A3DDPQ9342UNMY,B002QEHPQA,"N. Doyle ""film buff""","[0, 0]","Director Michael Mann has given us a stylish gangster film, the kind that Warner Bros. used to make in the studio days with someone like James Cagney as Cody Jarrett in WHITE HEAT.This time the gangster is real-life public hero, John Dillinger, played in JOHNNY DEPP style by the actor who is convincing as the man who, from the very opening scene, plans a prison break that Mann has filmed with startling realism that jumps off the screen. I say hero because that was the public's perception during the Great Depression of any man who could thwart the authorities and rob banks with such authority and skill.MARION COTILLARD is the love interest, the only angle of the film that reminds one of Hollywood hokum, the way the gals were always featured in the Cagney and Bogart crime melodramas--but she plays her part well and is especially strong in some of the final scenes where the police are giving her a brutal interrogation in an attempt to locate Dillinger.Technical credits are all excellent, including the photography and background music, evocative of the '30s settings. Interesting use of some Billie Holiday songs on the soundtrack are combined with an effective and unobtrusive soundtrack by composer Elliot Goldenthal.The only weakness is that most of the other supporting members are given little character development to work with--but since the camera is almost always on Depp as Dillinger, who gives a riveting performance, this can easily be overlooked. Good chemistry between Depp and Cotillard is an asset.There are only two other main characters of interest--CHRISTIAN BALE as Melvin Purvis and BILLY CRUDUP as J. Edgar Hoover. Both are excellent. Bale comes across as a basically decent man from Tennessee who is practically forced into becoming an enforcer by Hoover who is anxious to get his Federal Bureau of Investigation started. His first job is to go after Pretty Boy Floyd. When Floyd is killed, Hoover knows he found the right man for the job of hunting down Dillinger and his gang.The shootouts are exceptionally well staged and there are many of them throughout the story of one of America's most famous outlaws. Although the film runs two hours and twenty minutes, there is seldom a lull in the storyline, thanks to some very impressive direction by Michael Mann and some fine performances from the cast.The windup concludes with Dillinger attending the Biograph theater to see Clark Gable, William Powell and Myrna Loy in MANHATTAN MELODRAMA. When the police learn that he has a choice of two theaters, one of the detectives asks what's playing at both. We know they made the right choice for their ambush when a detective says with assurance, ""John Dillinger isn't going to see a Shirley Temple movie!""",4,"Detective: ""John Dillinger isn't going to watch a Shirley Temple movie!""",1246924800,"07 7, 2009",2009,2738,"['Director', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'given', 'stylish', 'gangster', 'film', 'kind', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'used', 'make', 'studio', 'days', 'someone', 'James', 'Cagney', 'Cody', 'Jarrett', 'WHITE', 'HEAT.This', 'time', 'gangster', 'real-life', 'public', 'hero', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'played', 'JOHNNY', 'DEPP', 'style', 'actor', 'who', 'convincing', 'man', 'who', 'very', 'opening', 'scene', 'prison', 'break', 'Mann', 'filmed', 'startling', 'realism', 'screen', 'say', 'hero', 'was', 'public', 'perception', 'Great', 'Depression', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'thwart', 'authorities', 'rob', 'banks', 'such', 'authority', 'skill.MARION', 'COTILLARD', 'love', 'interest', 'only', 'angle', 'film', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'hokum', 'way', 'gals', 'were', 'always', 'featured', 'Cagney', 'Bogart', 'crime', 'melodramas', 'part', 'well', 'especially', 'strong', 'final', 'scenes', 'where', 'police', 'are', 'giving', 'brutal', 'interrogation', 'attempt', 'locate', 'Dillinger.Technical', 'credits', 'are', 'excellent', 'including', 'photography', 'background', 'music', 'evocative', ""'30s"", 'settings', 'Interesting', 'use', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'combined', 'effective', 'unobtrusive', 'soundtrack', 'composer', 'Elliot', 'Goldenthal.The', 'only', 'weakness', 'most', 'other', 'supporting', 'members', 'are', 'given', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'work', 'camera', 'almost', 'always', 'Depp', 'Dillinger', 'who', 'riveting', 'performance', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'overlooked', 'Good', 'chemistry', 'Depp', 'Cotillard', 'asset.There', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'interest', 'CHRISTIAN', 'BALE', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'BILLY', 'CRUDUP', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'are', 'excellent', 'Bale', 'across', 'basically', 'decent', 'man', 'Tennessee', 'who', 'practically', 'forced', 'becoming', 'enforcer', 'Hoover', 'who', 'anxious', 'get', 'Federal', 'Bureau', 'Investigation', 'started', 'first', 'job', 'go', 'Pretty', 'Boy', 'Floyd', 'When', 'Floyd', 'killed', 'Hoover', 'found', 'right', 'man', 'job', 'hunting', 'down', 'Dillinger', 'gang.The', 'shootouts', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'staged', 'are', 'many', 'story', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'famous', 'outlaws', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'seldom', 'lull', 'storyline', 'thanks', 'very', 'impressive', 'direction', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'fine', 'performances', 'cast.The', 'windup', 'Dillinger', 'attending', 'Biograph', 'theater', 'see', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'William', 'Powell', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'MANHATTAN', 'MELODRAMA', 'When', 'police', 'learn', 'choice', 'two', 'theaters', 'one', 'detectives', 'asks', 'what', 'playing', 'know', 'made', 'right', 'choice', 'ambush', 'when', 'detective', 'assurance', 'John', 'Dillinger', ""n't"", 'going', 'see', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'movie']",Public Enemies
1283942,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B002QEHPQA,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[5, 7]","Ranking up there with his best works, namely Heat and Thief, Michael Mann's Public Enemies is a spectacular true crime saga, focusing on notorious bank robber John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) in the booming crime wave of the 1930s.  At the behest of FBI head J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup), G-man Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) leads the charge to bring down Dillinger, no matter the cost.  In the meantime, Dillinger romances the beautiful Billie Frechette (Marion Cottillard) as he moves from one big score to the next, all the while the cat & mouse game between him and Purvis continues to escalate.  Shot on HD video, Public Enemies at times looks both spectacular and just plain blurry, but from a technical standpoint otherwise, the film is wonderful.  On the acting side of things, Depp, Bale, and Cottillard are spectacular; while Mann manages to assemble a cast that also includes Stephen Graham as Baby Face Nelson, Stephen Dorff, Giovanni Ribisi, Stephen Lang, David Wenham, John Ortiz, Brotherhood's Jason Clarke, Rory Cochrane, Emile de Ravin, Leelee Sobieski, and Channing Tatum in a blink and you'll miss him turn as Pretty Boy Floyd.

It has all the Michael Mann trademarks;Fixation with period authenticity.  You saw this in his 'Last of the Mohicans'. The clothing, cars, guns, locations (many of which were the actual locations of Dillinger himself), manner of speech (they did speak in that clipped manner back then. Just watch period newsreels), the depression era streets, etc.Masterful blending of the score with the film.  Mann loves doing this. Going all the way back to Miami Vice days.  The opening scene of Purvis chasing down Pretty Boy Floyd with Otis Taylor's wonderful Blues song in the background is classic Mann.Pacing.  The fact that the film involves many characters and not just Dillinger, Purvis and Billie, affords the director lots of opportunity to move between scenes and people to rivet the attention of the audience.  No where is their boredom in this movie.  This movie felt like two hours but that was because it was stuffed with content.Acting:  Everyone was believable in their roles.  I was afraid that Depp's stardom and good looks would detract from his ability to be Dillinger, who was not that attractive.  But as good an actor as he is and the fact that he spends a lot of the time bloodied up,  made it work.  Bale's tightly controlled 'G Man' demeanor  was spot on.  A true cutout from the J Edgar Hoover mold, as demanded  by Hoover himself.  And I agree with the Wall Steet Journal that Marion Cottilard was a stand out.  No flash in the pan actress here. She's a  real talent.  Finally, Stephen Graham  did an excellent job playing Baby Face Nelson as the homicidal maniac he was.Finally, the gun battles. After all this is a gangster movie.  Mann has gone beyond himself here.  As good as Heat was this is much better. The camera angles shot across the line of sight of the blazing Tommy guns,  the muzzle flashes in the night, the noise, and the climactic battle at the gang's hangout in Wisconsin where Baby Face Nelson finally gets it,  are all film making excellence.This is more than a good cops and robbers movie.

That is not to say that Mr. Bale isn't a match for Mr. Depp, playing an FBI agent who, like his boss, J. Edgar Hoover, seeks to put a modern spin on crime-fighting.  Though they rarely share scenes, their conflict during the hunt is always at the forefront and these gentlemen make the most of it.  From Depp's taunting diologue to Bale's determined stance, you'll always find yourselves wanting to know what happens next.  All the while, these men are surrounded by a great cast of supporting characters, though Billy Crudup ought to have gotten more screen time...oh well, I suppose the story couldn't accomidate.  Marion Cotillard plays more than a simple interest that Hollywood seems to require no matter what...properly fuses herself with Depp's performance, showing why these lovebirds were ""meant to be"".  A list of actors too long for this review make up a list of gangsters in John Dillinger's and other gangs who ran wild throughout the United States, making things as chaotic as they were supposed to be.  Overall, this is a great film about a character in history that anyone would love to learn more about.  True, this film isn't entirely historically accurate, but it's Hollywood...you can do research later.

1283949,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B002QEHPQA,PJR,"[0, 1]","Good job. I would watch it again.But it is worth mentioning that there were some problems and some have been mentioned by other reviewers. Mostly, the history was liberal cutting and pasting. This is not surprising in historical films. Also it is more about story than about character exploration. I would have liked more character exploration, but that is a matter of taste. Also I wish they had made it clear how gangsters could be heroes to large segments of the public in those years, when the economy was so bad and the banks were seen as the bad guys, and the cops were seen as being corrupt.That said, this is more about the historical legendary Dillinger rather than reliable history. Yet I feel that the film was actually not so much about Dillinger as it was about FBI politics and Hoover's public relations. Or, it was well balanced between both.A few decades ago it would have been very daring to go into this. Now we all know how Hoover was so relentlessly focused on developing the image of the FBI that he was misleading the public and even the elected politicians. Bureaucracy at work!! Good to see this sort of reality in films.In this connection and with regard to historical accuracy, there is in fact good evidence that Dillinger was not killed in the famous theatre incident of popular history and featured in the film. Film critic Roger Ebert has a lengthy posting on his blog that he requested from an author who has written extensively on this. [...]This would make for another really, really terrific film! Maybe someday Oliver Stone will make it!Public Enemies could serve as a lead in to this film in that the Depp film does give a feeling for how desperate the FBI was to nail Public Enemy #1 in order to look good in the public eye and for budgetary reasons. So a coverup of the alleged fact that they killed the wrong guy is not only in accord with the published revelations that Ebert put into his blog, but it also would be quite understandable in terms of the personalities and politics involved.Nevertheless, I liked Public Enemies.

1283953,A1K6K23WG0IBWE,B002QEHPQA,Quadro Sinead Summer,"[1, 1]","Michael Mann has come a long ways since his early days as creator of the classic, glitsy, and gritty tv series Miami Vice. He's directed numerous excellent crime dramas ever since for the big screen. Manhunter- the original early 80's shocker that first introduced movie-goers to Hannibal Lector, the epic classic cops and robbers flick 'Heat', with Pacino and De Niro, and Collateral, which proved Tom Cruise could make a really evil bad guy. In his latest effort- Public Enemies, Mann has made a movie about John Dillinger that is the most factually accurate thus far. The film also has excellent location choices, hairstyles, cars, etc. from the era. Johnny Depp might not be as close a match to the real Dillinger as Warren Oates was in the 1970's version of the story, but somehow he manages to bring the very essence of who Dillinger was to the role despite that. Ben Johnson took on the role of Melvin Pervis in that film, and he was incredible. Christian Bale on the other hand is about as opposite appearance wise from Ben Johnson as you can get, yet he somehow manages to bring Pervis to life and he makes him much more human and believable than Ben Johnson did. This is easily one of Bale's best performances to date. Depp is always good, and he too gives a truly great performance. This film really does get the facts straight and tells the story the way it was always meant to be told. Public Enemies should get a few oscar nominations in all fairness, but it greatly depends on how strong the competition get's this year. It looks like this year might have some strong contenders compared to the past 4 years which offered some serious duds.",4,Do I get a JR.

Dillinger is likable guy in spite of his ruthlessness. His buddies love him and stick with him though think and thin.  Women adore his charm.  He dresses like a succesful businessman in latest and finest fashion and makes Chicago the base of his adventures as a bank robber.Dillinger's love for Billie, young woman from Wisconsin of French and Native American heritage is type of a love story every woman dreams of.  He loves her and takes care of her the best possible way he can considering his line of work.  They have a lot in common.  Both come from humble social backgrounds, both loose their mothers early in their lives and have almost savage way of savoring life and all that comes with it.  They are smitten by each other and this type of volatile attraction is what makes their relationship unique.Cast assemble is wonderful - each character is powerful in their own way.

The period details are excellent; the film is stylish, with excellent art direction and costuming.  The machine guns alone are worth the price of admission.The problem is that both Dillinger and Purvis are men of action, not words.  Their speech is laconic and, in some cases little more than a series of grunts.  I could have used subtitles for many of the scenes.  The plot is straightforward.  Dillinger robs banks; Purvis tries to catch him; Frank Nitti looks on; Dillinger robs more banks; everybody shoots machine guns; Purvis tries to catch him . . .  The film does not have any noticeable themes and it does not engage us with any significant issues.  The characters are largely two-dimensional; the love scenes involving Depp and Cotillard are predictable and unexceptional.  The principal actors are not given the opportunity to show their chops and Stephen Lang is largely wasted.  Crudup plays the wooden Hoover in a wooden way.  Ribisi is a notable exception.

1283960,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002QEHPQA,RMurray847,"[21, 30]","It's hard to overstate how disappointed I was in PUBLIC ENEMIES.  Almost every aspect of the film was a letdown.  You've got folks like Johnny Depp and Michael Mann on board, and yet the result is long, sloppy and worst of all, BORING.Director Michael Mann (HEAT, LAST OF THE MOHICANS) seemed like a great choice for this subject matter.  An epic take on the true story of `30s era bank robber extraordinaire John Dillinger and Melvin Purvis, the FBI man who led the manhunt for ""Public Enemy #1.""  A huge opportunity for exquisite period details.  A chance to create some unforgettable gunbattles, featuring Tommy Guns...the old-style machine gun we just don't see in movies these days.  And a cast to die for, including Depp at Dillinger, Christian Bale as Purvis, Billy Crudup as J. Edgar Hoover and even newly minted Oscar-winner Marion Cottiliard at Billie, Dillinger's girlfriend.Mistake #1 was to film most of this on digital video.  It makes almost the entire movie murky, dark and slightly blurry.  Perhaps I shouldn't have expected something with the pristine, crystal-clear look of something like Scorsese's THE AVIATOR...but I did.  And after seeing how Mann's film looked, I wish even more so that my assumptions had been correct.  There may be excellent costume design and art direction in PUBLIC ENEMIES...but you can't tell because of the poor quality of image.Mistake #2 was a script that never develops ANY character.  We get virtually no background on Dillinger...he shows up to execute a prison break for some of his buddies and we're apparently already supposed to know all about him.  While I'm not asking for flashbacks of his youth or anything, I'd at least liked to have known what made him tick.  He apparently liked fast cars and high living...but Depp plays everything very somber and straight-faced.  Dillinger comes across as a stick-in-the-mud who doesn't know how to have fun.  Perhaps years of being chased have made him this way...but that's only guesswork on my part.  The script (and yes, the performance by Depp) give us almost nothing to work with.  In the end, we care nothing for Depp.  And we care nothing for the group of cohorts who pop in and out of his life.  He's always got various men around him, but we never really learn anything about any of them...I didn't even learn the names of anyone except Baby Face Nelson...and that, only because I knew that name from previous movies about Depression-era gangsters.  It took me awhile to figure out which actor was playing him though.  So there were no gangsters that I really cared about.Mistake #3 was in having too many action scenes that made no sense.  The opening jailbreak, for example...I couldn't really tell who was doing what.  Yes, I understand that shoot-outs and such are chaotic (like a miniature war battle)...but shouldn't we still have some sense of who is who and what they're trying to do?  There were a couple of scenes like that...not sure if it was poor editing or poor conception or poor direction.Mistake #4 was making the movie 2.5 hours.  I have no problem with a movie being long if it is involving.  None of the LORD OF THE RINGS movies was a chore to sit through.  GONE WITH THE WIND still holds me with no problem. But PUBLIC ENEMY had me squirming and looking at my watch like some kid dragged to an adult romance movie.There were moments that worked...just enough to make me regret even more how poor most of the film was.  There was a lengthy gun-battle, chase scene in a Wisconsin wood that was quite stirring.  It featured the blasting of Tommy guns and lots of sweaty gangsters and FBI men running around.  The only action scene that worked.There was a brief story about Dillinger using a craft attorney (well-played by Peter Geharty) to keep him from being transferred from a local jail to the state pen.  It was funny and interesting at the same time.  Towards the end of the film, Cotilliard's Billie actually manages to generate some sympathy during her protracted interrogation by a thug-like FBI man.  And Lord help me, but Christian Bale actually managed to be somewhat interesting.  He plays a very tight and very determined G-man...seething at how often Dillinger thwarts him.  Bale is not a favorite of mine, but his work here was credible.I mentioned Scorsese earlier.  While it's almost too easy to play this card, I believe now that if an EPIC film about Dillinger was needed...he would have been the best man to go to.  I've enjoyed Mann's work in the past, and he's certainly handled lengthy work before (I'm a big MOHICAN fan)...but somehow he fumbled quite badly here.  Certainly, Scorsese would at least put his movie on FILM and not Digital video.And for Depp, I'm sure this is just a momentary blip in his stellar career.  I do think it shows that he is not the man for the job if you need a quiet, contained, closed-off character.  Depp needs room to be expansive.  Towards the end of the film, Dillinger brazenly wanders into the offices of the very office charged with catching him.  Most of the staff is either gone or listening to a ball game on the radio, so Dillinger is able to wander around, looking at all the evidence gathered about him.  We see glee dancing in Depp's eyes...he FINALLY made Dillinger come to life, but it was more than 2 hours too late.",2,Most disappointing movie of the year.,1246838400,"07 6, 2009",2009,5315,"['hard',

1283963,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B002QEHPQA,Robin Friedman,"[1, 1]","This newly released gangster movie tells the story of  John Dillinger, (1903 - 1934), the first person to be named ""Public Enemy Number 1"" by the FBI.  The movie shows the FBI's pursuit and ultimate killing of Dillinger.  The movie is a lengthy and expensive blockbuster. Johnny Depp plays Dillinger; Christian Bale plays his nemesis, FBI agent Melvin Purvis, and Marion Cotillard plays Dillinger's girlfriend, Billie Frechette. Michael Mann is the director.This is a movie of mixed merit.  Dillinger's violent life as a bank robber has been the stuff of many a movie and book.  This movie does not add a great deal, and, more importantly, it expects too much from its viewers.  The opening scene, in which Dillinger masterminds an escape from an Indian prison in 1933 is confusing to watch and gets the movie off to a bad start. In a gangster movie, I expect a good degree of violence and gun play. But in this movie, they are too long, too many, and too overdone.  They detract from the story and are difficult to follow. Dillinger and his gang and Purvis and his agents seem, possibly by design, too much alike and difficult to identify and tell apart. The viewer doesn't get to know them. Johnny Depp offers a stony-faced taciturn portrayal of Dillinger which is tough and effective as far as it goes.  But we really don't get to understand Dillinger very well either.  He doesn't evoke a strong response here, either of sympathy or of condemnation We see somewhat more of the character of Purvis with his dedication to his mission and also with his ambivalence about the methods the FBI pursues. Cotillard gives a passionate portrayal of Frechette. Her scenes, both with and without Depp, are among the best in the movie.  Billie Crudup offers a surprisingly effective and realistic portrayal of a young but already menacing J. Edgar Hoover.The scenes of Depression-era Chicago, the uses of lightings, old shabby buildings, and period costumes is gritty and realistic.  Much of the movie was shot in Wisconsin and in Indiana, in addition to Chicago.  A shoot-out scene at the Lake Bohemia Lodge, Manitowish, Wisconsin was filmed on-site. The movie does have a feeling of toughness and rawness about it.The story is told in a disjointed way, but individual scenes are effective. The most effective moments are those with Frechette and with the infamous ""Lady in Red"" near the end of the movie who was responsible for Dillinger's demise. Also effective are scenes which portray how Chicago's organized crime syndicate distanced itself from Dillinger and scenes of a court hearing in Indiana in which a flamboyant local lawyer persuades a local judge not to transfer Dillinger to a more secure facility. Dillinger soon shows the error in this decision. Unusually for the time, the Indiana jail from which Dillinger escaped was within the purview of a woman, Sheriff Lillian Holley who is well-portrayed in the movie by Lili Taylor.Those who like crime, gangster and noir will enjoy this movie. It is a good but not a special movie of its type.Robin Friedman",4,A New Retelling of the Story of John Dillinger,1247443200,"07 13, 2009",2009,3059,"['newly', 'released', 'gangster', 'movie', 'story', 'John', 'Dillinger', '1903', '1934', 'first', 'person', 'be', 'named', 'Public', 'Enemy', 'Number', '1', 'FBI', 'movie', 'FBI', 'pursuit', 'ultimate', 'killing', 'Dillinger', 'movie', 'lengthy', 'expensive', 'blockbuster', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Dillinger', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'nemesis', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Dillinger', 'girlfriend', 'Billie', 'Frechette', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'director.This', 'movie', 'mixed', 'merit', 'Dillinger', 'violent', 'life', 'bank', 'robber', 'been', 'stuff', 'many', 'movie', 'book', 'movie', 'not', 'add', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'importantly', 'too', 'much', 'viewers', 'opening', 'scene', 'Dillinger', 'escape', 'Indian', 'prison', '1933', 'confusing', 'watch', 'movie', 'bad', 'start', 'gangster', 'movie', 'expect', 'good', 'degree', 'violence', 'gun', 'play', 'movie', 'are', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'many', 'too', 'overdone', 'detract', 'story', 'are', 'difficult', 'follow', 'Dillinger', 'gang', 'Purvis', 'agents', 'seem', 'possibly', 'design', 'too', 'much', 'difficult', 'identify', 'tell', 'apart', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'stony-faced', 'taciturn', 'portrayal', 'Dillinger', 'tough', 'effective', 'as', 'far', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'understand', 'Dillinger', 'very', 'well', 'either', ""n't"", 'evoke', 'strong', 'response', 'here', 'sympathy', 'condemnation', 'see', 'somewhat', 'more', 'character', 'Purvis', 'dedication', 'mission', 'also', 'ambivalence', 'methods', 'FBI', 'pursues', 'Cotillard', 'passionate', 'portrayal', 'Frechette', 'Her', 'scenes', 'Depp', 'are', 'best', 'movie', 'Billie', 'Crudup', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'young', 'already', 'menacing', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover.The', 'scenes', 'Depression-era', 'Chicago', 'uses', 'lightings', 'old', 'shabby', 'buildings', 'period', 'costumes', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'Much', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'Wisconsin', 'Indiana', 'addition', 'Chicago', 'shoot-out', 'scene', 'Lake', 'Bohemia', 'Lodge', 'Manitowish', 'Wisconsin', 'was', 'filmed', 'on-site', 'movie', 'have', 'feeling', 'toughness', 'rawness', 'it.The', 'story', 'told', 'disjointed', 'way', 'individual', 'scenes', 'are', 'effective', 'most', 'effective', 'moments', 'are', 'Frechette', 'infamous', 'Lady', 'Red', 'end', 'movie', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'Dillinger', 'demise', 'Also', 'effective', 'are', 'scenes', 'portray', 'how', 'Chicago', 'organized', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'distanced', 'Dillinger', 'scenes', 'court', 'hearing', 'Indiana', 'flamboyant', 'local', 'lawyer', 'local', 'judge', 'not', 'transfer', 'Dillinger', 'more', 'secure', 'facility', 'Dillinger', 'soon', 'error', 'decision', 'Unusually', 'time', 'Indiana', 'jail', 'Dillinger', 'escaped', 'was', 'purview', 'woman', 'Sheriff', 'Lillian', 'Holley', 'who', 'well-portrayed', 'movie', 'Lili', 'Taylor.Those', 'who', 'crime', 'gangster', 'noir', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'good', 'not', 'special', 'movie', 'type.Robin', 'Friedman']",Public Enemies

But this one was Michael Mann's. A true artist, a hero of mine, creator of fine entertainments like Heat, The Last of the Mohicans, Miami Vice (the TV series) and Collateral. He's proved and re-proved he's a cinematic genius. But here, the aim must've been money, not a reach for a true creative piece.Public Enemies better describes the deal makers here, putting together a celebrity-driven, ripe-for-hype piece of tripe. Every performer kept the same expression (dour, sullen, numb) throughout the 140 minutes of the same-seeming machine-gunning, sepia-tinted crime spree. Okay, bad word; nothing in this drumming, same-old flick was spree-full. I guess like too-many sequel series (Lethal Weapon comes immediately to mind; LW4 is never-ending schtick, so cliched it was painful to watch, a true waste of time and talent). I I lament creativity and pride wearing out, go lame. This sad flick limps from spree-less start to finish. No memorable characterizations, certainly no entertainment. Nothing surprises or impresses, is memorable or laudable. Well, maybe if you're an antique-car buff you might get a tingle.Mann had a knack of delivering great action without trite devices while creating great characters and complex, sophisticated plots. I guess when money's the object, that appetite for greatness withers. I'm so sorry, and abit mad for Mr. Mann's final movies (I assume he'll want more moolah before he goes gently into the night) swirl around the bowl. Lesson learned: When a great director nears the end of his career, best to rent his final opus' before adding it to your collection. Creatively, caveat emptor.As for the much-promoted J. Depp and C. Bale; well, they're not at the ends of their careers. But a few moreprojects like Public Enemies will move them alot closer to that fabled light at the end of the long tunnel. Theircharacters and performances in Public Enemies will fade fast.

Each one of these films show a different perspective of the life and times of the infamous gangster. Personally, I like the charismatic performance of Warren Oates as Dillinger and the overall film directed by John Milius,historically the 1945,1973,versions are probably the most accurate,the 1945 version was shot in a short seventy seven minutes. Public Enemies is accurate in the history of Dillinger,in a different order of sequences,though the script doesn't explain the break out scene and the wooden gun to viewers that are not familiar with the exploits of John Dillinger portrayed by the laid back Johnny Depp,maybe a little ""too"" laid back for the part,almost subdued. Christian Bale does his part as G-man Melvin Purvis. Marion Cotillard ""is"" Dillinger's girl in her role. Stephen Graham is the notorious ""baby face"" Nelson. Loaded with shootouts,bullets flying like the old west,the film is expertly directed by Michael Mann,Public Enemies is like the real deal,it takes you back to 1933. If there was one flaw in the film,the title tells the story,the war or rivalry between Purvis and Dillinger,director Mann and the writers fall short of capturing this and the character study of the two actors,Depp and Bale. One scene in the film, in their only confrontation,Purvis walks his way out towards the cell block door, Dillinger says, ""better find yourself another line of work Melvin"" this single line actually saves the scene. The film is entertaining,long,but not drawn out.  The two disc special edition includes ""the making of"",and a short documentary of the real John Dillinger and other outlaws of the era.",4,Dillinger Rides Again..,1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,1757,"['1945', 'Dillinger', 'starring', 'Lawrence', 'Tierney,1973', 'Dillinger', 'starring', 'Warren', 'Oates', 'now', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'one', 'films', 'show', 'different', 'perspective', 'life', 'times', 'infamous', 'gangster', 'Personally', 'like', 'charismatic', 'performance', 'Warren', 'Oates', 'Dillinger', 'overall', 'film', 'directed', 'John', 'Milius', 'historically', '1945,1973', 'versions', 'are', 'probably', 'most', 'accurate', '1945', 'version', 'was', 'shot', 'short', 'seventy', 'seven', 'minutes', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'accurate', 'history', 'Dillinger', 'different', 'order', 'sequences', 'script', ""n't"", 'explain', 'break', 'scene', 'wooden', 'gun', 'viewers', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'exploits', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'portrayed', 'laid', 'back', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'maybe', 'little', 'too', 'laid', 'back', 'part', 'almost', 'subdued', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'part', 'G-man', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Dillinger', 'girl', 'role', 'Stephen', 'Graham', 'notorious', 'baby', 'face', 'Nelson', 'Loaded', 'shootouts', 'bullets', 'flying', 'old', 'west', 'film', 'expertly', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'real', 'deal', 'back', '1933', 'was', 'one', 'flaw', 'film', 'title', 'story', 'war', 'rivalry', 'Purvis', 'Dillinger', 'director', 'Mann', 'writers', 'fall', 'short', 'capturing', 'character', 'study', 'two', 'actors', 'Depp', 'Bale', 'One', 'scene', 'film', 'only', 'confrontation', 'Purvis', 'walks', 'way', 'cell', 'block', 'door', 'Dillinger', 'better', 'find', 'line', 'work', 'Melvin', 'single', 'line', 'actually', 'scene', 'film', 'entertaining', 'long', 'not', 'drawn', 'out', 'two', 'disc', 'special', 'edition', 'making', 'short', 'documentary', 'real', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'other', 'outlaws', 'era']",Public Enemies

Johnny Depp.  I could take him or leave him.  Some roles I love him in.  Others, not so much.  I really don't think he's a good actor, but there were other factors that drew me to the movie, and sometimes he hits a role dead on.I ended up getting the movie, and before putting it in and watching it, I read the back cover.  I had no idea that Christian Bale was in it - a fine actor - or that it was directed by Michael Mann - my favorite director.  Needless to say, I was excited to finally own and watch it.It lost me after the first half hour with its platitudes and inaccuracies.I'm no professional scholar on John Dillinger, but I have read a little about him, and the gangster era in general.  For those reading, if you are an American history buff, you absolutely need to read ""The Dillinger Days"".  It's about 20 years old now, but I'm sure you can find it here on Amazon.  It focuses on the 18 months that the midwest was rampaged by high-profile gangsters such as Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, Machine Gun Kelly, Bonnie and Clyde, the Barker Gang, and the College Kidnappers.  It covers all these topics, and details the long-ignored third side to The Depression - the gangsters, besides Capone (the first two sides being The Depression itself, and Prohibition).This is an important period in US history as it details how the FBI and ATF came to be, pulling us further into a Union, rather than independent states - for better or worse.So, I guess my standards started off rather high with this movie.  It failed to deliver.First, technical stuff.  The sound and visuals were good.  But, the transitions between scenes left me scratching my head.  ""Where are we right now?"", and ""How did that person get there?"", and ""Who exactly is that person, and why do I care about them?"" were three common questions that I kept asking myself during the movie.Also, the movie moved at a quick pace - too quick.  If they simply slowed it down, and devoted more to the progression, it would have made a huge difference.Second, the accuracy.  As I said above, I have read a little about this era.  While I read the various material, I put myself in the roles of the various characters involved - I have considered their motivations, and what daily life would be like for these people.  When I saw it played out on the big screen, it just seemed, uh, well, very implausible.But, again with the accuracy, there are things that happened in this movie that are in direct contradiction to what I have read.  This just made it overall silly.",2,Depp in Chicago.

Early in the Great Depression and with many banks shutting down four years before, the public had little love for banks, so bank robberies were not really so bad -- that's why I figure many in the film cheered him and treated him like a celebrity.  Even the reporters would joke with him and enjoy his stories.The movie depicts J. Edgar Hoover as an inept FBI administrator who cared more for the spotlight, getting his mug on newsreels and extolling his Junior G-Men program rather than give Agent Purvis (Christian BaleBatman Begins (Widescreen Edition)) the men he needed to get Dillinger.Bale is very cold, determined and at times plays with just that one note.  I would have liked to have seen more detail, planning and character development but who knows?  Perhaps he was that way in real life?Dillinger -- robs banks, falls for Billie Frechette (played in an overdramatic way by Marion CotillardPretty Things) and outsmarts the cops.  But little else.  No this film is not a biographic exploitation of one of the most celebrated of bank robbers.  But I would have liked more LIFE in the character.  I felt the ""love story"" a bit flat, but the story was based on Dillinger and that's what we got.Many historical accuracies include Dillinger walking into the Chicago Police Station's Dillinger unit and just waltzing around checking things out -- pure arrogance was a side that I enjoyed.  Getting gunned down, betrayed by the ""lady in red"".Apparently the gangster psychology enjoyed the Hollywood depiction of gangsters and Dillinger was no exception, enjoying the film ""Manhattan Melodrama"", (Myrna Loy and William Powell Collection (Manhattan Melodrama / Evelyn Prentice / Double Wedding / I Love You Again / Love Crazy)) some of which we got to see.It was great seeing Myrna Loy, William Powell and Clark Gable on a modern silver screen.  In fact, I may pick it up.  Editing was a bit sloppy in that scene, showing Myrna Loy twice for no apparent reason -- classic Silver Screen Actress.  (I read that Powell and Loy would go onto fame as the famous comedy team a few weeks later in The Thin Man series -- which I have seen -- and so was surprised by the serious role here, but that's for another review).The Complete Thin Man Collection (The Thin Man / After the Thin Man / Another Thin Man / Shadow of the Thin Man / The Thin Man Goes Home / Song of the Thin Man / Alias Nick and Nora)Overall, an accurate, well-plotted effort.  At times a bit slow, at times wishing the bland music was actually building suspense than boredom, but a good effort.

It is an entertaining backseat ride into the life of a country boy turned bank robber in a time where America hated money-makers and banks. A time when people were starving and in need of a gun-toting, charismatic mid-western boy to stir things up a bit, one bank robbery at a time.A Cast of Winning PlayersDirector Michael Mann is known best for Heat, Collateral and Miami Vice. His attention to detail is known and it is said that he went above the call of duty in his research for this movie. Obviously he deemed it important to depict a true version of the Dillinger story with a bit of Hollywood sprinkled in to keep our attention. Johnny Depp is solid as the charismatic bank robber, adopting his mannerisms, speech and swagger and even the trademark smirk that is seen on all of Dillinger's photos. Christian Bale is perfect as Melvin Purvis, looking similar to the ""G man"" and confidently playing the role convincingly.Digital Camera and No true sense of good and BadThe camera threw me off a bit switching from an old sepia toned look to a digital one during fights. At times it made you feel as if you were an observant on the street while other times it felt just like a movie. I wasn't sure why this was but I concluded that Mann wanted us to be there with Dillinger most of the time and at other times we are to observe from a distance. There was no great love felt for any of the dark heroes, the charismatic Dillinger was likeable but I never felt concern for his well-being. The FBI agent in Purvis (Christian Bale) was the typical white knight archetype and was given little personality outside of this so I felt nothing for him either. The romance between Dillinger and Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) was interesting but felt cliched (gangsters always have THAT chick in these movies) and just like real life that political blowhard J.Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) is the only real ""bad guy"" in the entire film.Final ThoughtsIt felt like a different time period and the choreography of the gunfights were done well enough to keep me interested. With as colorful a crew as the boys who ran with John Dillinger, it would have been hard to direct a movie like this while keeping everyone relative. Men like Alvin Karpis (Giovanni Ribisi), Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum) and Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham) are given screen time, as well as Capone's number one do-boy Frank Nitti (Bill Camp). Still there was so much shown that you tend to lose your familiarity with Dillinger's quest for whatever it is he wanted and the hopelessness of his situation settles in after awhile.It is a good movie with no real emotional weight, just a ""this is what happened"" gloss to the entire thing with a sprinkling of charisma to top it off.

So without further ado (and please forgive the typos) let's get started.If you seen the original movieDillinger, which starred Warren Oates in the tile role and a very young Richard Dreyfus as Lester ""Baby Face"" Nelson, you would be inclined to think that this movie is simply a remake, and in some respects you would be correct, but it is not.Mann and Depp do a remarkable job, as do all the other actors in this movie, in telling not only the story of John Dillinger, but also all the other players and circumstances that ultimately led to Dillinger's demise and the rise of the FBI, which may not have even really come into being had it not been for the exploits of Dillinger, but that is another story that really needs to be told.Mann includes all of the historical characters in this movie and some of which you probably didn't even know existed unless you have done some research on your own. Characters including the infamous ""Lady in Red"" Anna Sage, who betrayed Dillinger and then was herself betrayed. Big surprise there! J. Edgar ""Cross Dressing"" Hoover, Melvin Purvis, Pretty Boy Floyd, and the entire host of depression era gangsters with the notable exclusion of Bonnie and Clyde.My one complaint with this movie and this is strictly a male testosterone driven comment here, is that they spent way too much time on the love interest between Dillinger and Billie. I would like to have seen a few more detailed shoot-outs and bank robberies and leave the love scenes between the two on the cutting room floor.

1283977,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B002QEHPQA,Steve,"[0, 0]","Public Enemies was a disappointment. Not of colossal proportions, but nonetheless, not as good as I thought it would be.Sadly, the biggest offense is that is was dull. I watched an hour long documentary on the Depression era bank robbers featured in the film and it was far more entertaining. Amazingly, this film manages to take what was a wild ride by a criminal who defied belief with his jail escapes and good fortune and turned it into a plodding half-baked love story coupled with an equally underdeveloped character study of the main two ""public enemies,"" Dillinger and Purvis.An additional problem (that others noted as well) is the dialogue. Depp in particular mumbles a lot and I had to re-start from the beginning with the subtitles on to catch a good quarter of the dialogue I'd have otherwise missed. With today's filmmaking techniques, that's inexcusable. First of all, why have an actor mumble his lines and secondly, why not try to overdub them?Depp's Dillinger is predictably roguish, but the only real moment I felt the actor was stretching beyond a smirking exercise was after his gal was arrested. Depp can do much better but he was clearly type-cast and not really required to flex his acting muscle. As for Bale's Purvis...let me ask this; does Christian Bale know how to act beyond the same cold-blooded, wooden persona that brought him fame in American Psycho? Through a good half dozen roles I've seen him perform; he never changes or shows any range whatsoever.This seemed like a great opportunity to tell a tale about a man whose life was legendary, but the director (and I suppose the author of the book the movie was based on) spread things too thin and thus nothing stands out. It's as flat as the midwestern countryside that serves as much of the backdrop.It isn't horrible by any means, but it is not nearly as good as a story about the infamous John Dillinger could have and should have been. Like the hapless law enforcement officers chasing the elusive Dillinger, the director lets things slip through his fingers.",3,Missed opportunity,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,2049,"['Public', 'Enemies', 'was', 'disappointment', 'Not', 'colossal', 'proportions', 'nonetheless', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'thought', 'would', 'be.Sadly', 'biggest', 'offense', 'was', 'dull', 'watched', 'hour', 'long', 'documentary', 'Depression', 'era', 'bank', 'robbers', 'featured', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Amazingly', 'film', 'take', 'what', 'was', 'wild', 'ride', 'criminal', 'who', 'defied', 'belief', 'jail', 'escapes', 'good', 'fortune', 'turned', 'plodding', 'half-baked', 'love', 'story', 'coupled', 'equally', 'underdeveloped', 'character', 'study', 'main', 'two', 'public', 'enemies', 'Dillinger', 'Purvis.An', 'additional', 'problem', 'others', 'noted', 'as', 'well', 'dialogue', 'Depp', 'particular', 'mumbles', 'lot', 'had', 're-start', 'beginning', 'subtitles', 'catch', 'good', 'quarter', 'dialogue', ""'d"", 'have', 'otherwise', 'missed', 'today', 'filmmaking', 'techniques', 'inexcusable', 'First', 'why', 'have', 'actor', 'mumble', 'lines', 'secondly', 'why', 'not', 'try', 'overdub', 'Depp', 'Dillinger', 'predictably', 'roguish', 'only', 'real', 'moment', 'felt', 'actor', 'was', 'stretching', 'smirking', 'exercise', 'was', 'gal', 'was', 'arrested', 'Depp', 'can', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'clearly', 'type-cast', 'not', 'really', 'required', 'flex', 'acting', 'muscle', 'Bale', 'Purvis', 'let', 'ask', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'know', 'how', 'act', 'same', 'cold-blooded', 'wooden', 'persona', 'brought', 'fame', 'American', 'Psycho', 'good', 'half', 'dozen', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'perform', 'never', 'range', 'whatsoever.This', 'seemed', 'great', 'opportunity', 'tell', 'tale', 'man', 'life', 'was', 'legendary', 'director', 'suppose', 'author', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'spread', 'things', 'too', 'thin', 'thus', 'nothing', 'out', 'as', 'flat', 'midwestern', 'countryside', 'as', 'much', 'backdrop.It', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'means', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'story', 'infamous', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'hapless', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officers', 'chasing', 'elusive', 'Dillinger', 'director', 'things', 'slip', 'fingers']",Public Enemies

So in fairly rating the BD that detraction list all comes true here, but I still enjoyed the incredible attention to prop detail and filming locations - both of which get covered adequately in the special features.The picture quality is standard to good as those cameras create the night blur/drag (similar to Miami Vice) but some of the outdoor scenes are clear enough to even see the lens/shutter change (reference the outdoor shot of the jail as Dillinger is driving/escaping - you can actually watch the camera operator change the filter from dull to sharp). The sound is mixed differently throughout depending on the location so some scenes are clear if the camera is pointing right at the speaker, but most do not allow you to have the volume set higher as the gun play is over-amped and/or loud scenes drown the dialogue (airplane, cars, guns, etc.). I still loved watching the performances and I already had read how historically inaccurate the story was but the other details made it a good film to watch - especially since they filmed in so many of the actual locations that the events occurred. Supplements are enjoyable and include:* 20:32 minute making-of. Mann centers the interviews and flow of the documentary and includes some thorough depictions of how some scenes were made and character preparation.* 8:44 minute Last Outlaw. Gives a brief history of how these guys were considered to be the last outlaws and covers the actual last moments of Dillinger's life.* 9:48 minute Locations. Shows all of the work put into filming at the three main historical locations of the story (Bohemian Lodge, the theater and the prison). Shows what can be done if you have enough money to do it right.* 9:39 minute Criminal Technology. Describes how/why Dillinger had the cars and guns that outperformed the police. Also shows how the FBI started to use more technology to fight these criminals. Some history about Winstead and his role in the shooting (references using outside law help to end Dillinger).* Commentary with Mann. I always enjoy listening to his theory on attention to detail and what it takes for him to make a film - granted not for everyone.* DBox - did not use it.* U-Control. Allows for using the PiP function and incorporating time lines while you watch.* BD Live. Did the Gangster Movie Challenge, it scrolls through multiple choice options of different movie trivia; had not watched American Gangster recently so I sucked and gave up but you should be able to get all of the PE questions. It does keep track and your score can be compared against other users.The menu is the standard Universal left-feeding live background action menu (good scenes, good music) but there are more options this time around to help facilitate BD Live stuff (two different icons for that) and learning about how to use everything on the BD (another icon for that). Plus a live feed (similar to a news feed) stays on the upper right quadrant of the menu screen that gives updates on BD live events and other movie stuff.Overall, a good product for fans of the film and those with a network connection.",4,"Technically adept, fun historical supplements",1260057600,"12 6, 2009",2009,3346,"['am', 'avid', 'supporter', 'Mann', 'work', 'so', 'had', 'expectations', 'PE', 'being', 'crystal', 'clear', 'Blu', 'cameras', 'articulate/perfect', 'sound', 'mixes', 'allow', 'crank', 'up', 'still', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'action', 'scenes', 'So', 'fairly', 'rating', 'BD', 'detraction', 'list', 'true', 'here', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'incredible', 'attention', 'prop', 'detail', 'filming', 'locations', 'get', 'covered', 'adequately', 'special', 'features.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'standard', 'good', 'cameras', 'create', 'night', 'blur/drag', 'similar', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'are', 'clear', 'enough', 'even', 'see', 'lens/shutter', 'change', 'reference', 'outdoor', 'shot', 'jail', 'Dillinger', 'driving/escaping', 'can', 'actually', 'watch', 'camera', 'operator', 'change', 'filter', 'dull', 'sharp', 'sound', 'mixed', 'differently', 'depending', 'location', 'so', 'scenes', 'are', 'clear', 'camera', 'pointing', 'right', 'speaker', 'most', 'do', 'not', 'allow', 'have', 'volume', 'set', 'higher', 'gun', 'play', 'over-amped', 'and/or', 'loud', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'airplane', 'cars', 'guns', 'etc.', 'still', 'loved', 'watching', 'performances', 'already', 'had', 'read', 'how', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'story', 'was', 'other', 'details', 'made', 'good', 'film', 'watch', 'especially', 'filmed', 'so', 'many', 'actual', 'locations', 'events', 'occurred', 'Supplements', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'include', '*', '20:32', 'minute', 'making-of', 'Mann', 'interviews', 'flow', 'documentary', 'thorough', 'depictions', 'how', 'scenes', 'were', 'made', 'character', 'preparation', '8:44', 'minute', 'Last', 'Outlaw', 'brief', 'history', 'how', 'guys', 'were', 'considered', 'be', 'last', 'outlaws', 'actual', 'last', 'moments', 'Dillinger', 'life', '9:48', 'minute', 'Locations', 'Shows', 'work', 'put', 'filming', 'three', 'main', 'historical', 'locations', 'story', 'Bohemian', 'Lodge', 'theater', 'prison', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'do', 'right', '*', '9:39', 'minute', 'Criminal', 'Technology', 'Describes', 'how/why', 'Dillinger', 'had', 'cars', 'guns', 'outperformed', 'police', 'Also', 'how', 'FBI', 'started', 'use', 'more', 'technology', 'fight', 'criminals', 'history', 'Winstead', 'role', 'shooting', 'references', 'using', 'outside', 'law', 'help', 'end', 'Dillinger', '*', 'Commentary', 'Mann', 'always', 'enjoy', 'listening', 'theory', 'attention', 'detail', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'granted', 'not', 'everyone', 'DBox', 'did', 'not', 'use', '*', 'U-Control', 'Allows', 'using', 'PiP', 'function', 'incorporating', 'time', 'lines', 'watch', '*', 'BD', 'Live', 'Did', 'Gangster', 'Movie', 'Challenge', 'multiple', 'choice', 'options', 'different', 'movie', 'trivia', 'had', 'not', 'watched', 'American', 'Gangster', 'recently', 'so', 'sucked', 'gave', 'up', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'PE', 'questions', 'keep', 'track', 'score', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'other', 'users.The', 'menu', 'standard', 'Universal', 'left-feeding', 'live', 'background', 'action', 'menu', 'good', 'scenes', 'good', 'music', 'are', 'more', 'options', 'time', 'help', 'facilitate', 'BD', 'Live', 'stuff', 'two', 'different', 'icons', 'learning', 'how', 'use', 'everything', 'BD', 'icon', 'live', 'feed', 'similar', 'news', 'feed', 'upper', 'right', 'quadrant', 'menu', 'screen', 'updates', 'BD', 'live', 'events', 'other', 'movie', 'stuff.Overall', 'good', 'product', 'fans', 'film', 'network', 'connection']",Public Enemies

There was a total of three swear words (if that), the violence was almost cartoonish (Dick Tracy with Warren Beatty was much more violent)and there was certainly no sexual content. But the hand held camera action was kind of unusual even though I know that Michael Mann was going for a natural look and I think they achieved that. Being the huge Johnny Depp fan that I am, it made me sick that while the filming of this movie was going on 11 miles down the road from where I live, I couldn't go meet him but I think he made an awesome Dillinger. He was definitely much more interesting than the real guy. The real Dillinger looked like a scum-bag. Depp gave him some class. I didn't really believe the character of his girlfriend though. The way he treated her, she had no reason to fall for the guy or put her life on the line the way they did. Even their one love scene was so lame, it was difficult to believe in their romance. The character of Billie had was about as charming and believable as a rock-nuthin! Christian Bale, on the other hand, as Melvin Purvis, scared the daylights out of me. He was determined to get Dillinger and I'm sure that is what drove him to madness, Purvis I mean. I also did not like the the beginning of the movie, where he shot down Pretty Boy Floyd like he was a deer. Not cool. All in all, I was O.K. with the film but I'm not so sure that I want to own it.

1283985,A3BMRSE8N1858V,B002QEHPQA,Terence Allen,"[74, 90]","""Public Enemies"" proves that Michael Mann is right up there with Martin Scorsese at directing compelling crime dramas. This film, based on a book detailing the nexus of John Dillinger, J. Edgar Hoover, and Melvin Purvis, covers the last year and a half in the life of the famed bank robber, who was branded ""Public Enemy Number 1"" by Hoover, who was building what would become the FBI. Chasing Dillinger for Hoover was Purvis, who relentlessly pursued Dillinger until the fateful night outside the Biography Theater in Chicago.Johnny Depp plays Dillinger as a fun-loving but dangerous criminal whose only plan seems to be to live life on the edge until he falls off. As usual, his performance is engaging and utterly believable. Billy Crudup wonderfully plays Hoover as a man obsessed with growing the Bureau, obsessed with public relations, and obsessed with capturing John Dilliger, and Christian Bale plays Purvis as an intelligent, capable, and caught in the difficult position of trying to catch Dillinger while at the same time pleasing a demanding, overbearing publicity seeker.The film features great supporting performances from Marion Cotillard as Dillinger's girlfriend, Billie Frechette, and Stephen Lang as a veteran Bureau agent assigned to hunt Dillinger.This is film has plenty of action and thrills, but also possesses great acting, intelligent writing, and masterful directing by Mann.

1283988,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B002QEHPQA,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[0, 1]","Like a selfish 1930's Robin Hood, John Dillinger was a charismatic and brash bank robber who swayed the public to his side even though his occupation was less than legal. Michael Mann's re-envisioning of the iconic gangster's adventures includes copious shootouts, car chases, and solid performances where the typical protagonists and antagonists switch roles, but it's still a shame that we're forced to root for the historically doomed.The year is 1933, a time considered by many an outlaw to be the ""Golden Age"" of bank robbery. For John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) it was a time of infinite possibilities where no bank could thwart him, no prison could hold him, and the beautiful Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) couldn't resist him. To combat the sharp incline in rampant criminal activity, J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) forms the FBI, led by the courageous Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), and targets Dillinger as public enemy number one. Relying on unorthodox methods of intelligence gathering (such as tracking the purchase location of a coat or recording phone conversations), the manpower of trained gunmen, and his own relentless nature, Purvis steadily closes in on the dauntless felon and his partners in crime.It feels like The Untouchables spiked with extra gritty violence, an admirable attention to visual details, and machinegun fire that pierces the eardrums with an authentic cannonade. It's a vivid, noirish, bloodthirsty 1930s. Unfortunately Public Enemies is largely forgettable - it's suspenseful, intense, action-packed and well-paced for its excessive running time, but by the conclusion, which of course follows history (with the occasional creative liberties), we're left with a simple biopic chronicling a man we're not supposed to side with. It contains a modernized education on notorious gangsters, but it can't outshine the flock of superior, similarly-structured films. Regardless of how charismatic Dillinger was in real life, Depp makes him a wholeheartedly likeable rogue, while Bale's Melvin Purvis comes across as the villain at times. It's not an uncommon switch to relate to the bad guy, but the adversity is in the inevitable ending.With deafening, exciting bank robberies that try to top 1995's Heat, Tommy gun campaigns, broads and molls, suicide doors, hardened criminal courtship, plenty of attitude and a general take-off-the-white-gloves bluster, Public Enemies definitely knows how to portray vivacity and action. While it doesn't do much to separate itself from the existing band of no-holds-barred gangster flicks, director Michael Mann skillfully makes this film as tense as an impossibly lengthy red light during a life-or-death stolen car getaway.- The Massie Twins",3,Public Enemies Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1246320000,"06 30, 2009",2009,2720,"['selfish', '1930', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'was', 'charismatic', 'brash', 'bank', 'robber', 'who', 'swayed', 'public', 'side', 'even', 'occupation', 'was', 'less', 'legal', 'Michael', 'Mann', 're-envisioning', 'iconic', 'gangster', 'adventures', 'copious', 'shootouts', 'car', 'chases', 'solid', 'performances', 'where', 'typical', 'protagonists', 'antagonists', 'switch', 'roles', 'still', 'shame', ""'re"", 'forced', 'root', 'historically', 'doomed.The', 'year', '1933', 'time', 'considered', 'many', 'outlaw', 'be', 'Golden', 'Age', 'bank', 'robbery', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'was', 'time', 'infinite', 'possibilities', 'where', 'bank', 'could', 'thwart', 'prison', 'could', 'hold', 'beautiful', 'Billie', 'Frechette', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'combat', 'sharp', 'incline', 'rampant', 'criminal', 'activity', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'FBI', 'led', 'courageous', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'targets', 'Dillinger', 'public', 'enemy', 'number', 'one', 'Relying', 'unorthodox', 'methods', 'intelligence', 'gathering', 'such', 'tracking', 'purchase', 'location', 'coat', 'recording', 'phone', 'conversations', 'manpower', 'trained', 'gunmen', 'own', 'relentless', 'nature', 'Purvis', 'steadily', 'dauntless', 'felon', 'partners', 'crime.It', 'feels', 'Untouchables', 'spiked', 'extra', 'gritty', 'violence', 'admirable', 'attention', 'visual', 'details', 'machinegun', 'fire', 'eardrums', 'authentic', 'cannonade', 'vivid', 'noirish', 'bloodthirsty', '1930s', 'Unfortunately', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'largely', 'forgettable', 'suspenseful', 'intense', 'action-packed', 'well-paced', 'excessive', 'running', 'time', 'conclusion', 'course', 'history', 'occasional', 'creative', 'liberties', ""'re"", 'left', 'simple', 'biopic', 'chronicling', 'man', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'side', 'modernized', 'education', 'notorious', 'gangsters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'outshine', 'flock', 'superior', 'similarly-structured', 'films', 'Regardless', 'how', 'charismatic', 'Dillinger', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'Depp', 'wholeheartedly', 'likeable', 'rogue', 'Bale', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'villain', 'times', 'not', 'uncommon', 'switch', 'relate', 'bad', 'guy', 'adversity', 'inevitable', 'ending.With', 'deafening', 'exciting', 'bank', 'robberies', 'try', 'top', '1995', 'Heat', 'Tommy', 'gun', 'campaigns', 'broads', 'molls', 'suicide', 'doors', 'hardened', 'criminal', 'courtship', 'plenty', 'attitude', 'general', 'take-off-the-white-gloves', 'bluster', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'definitely', 'how', 'portray', 'vivacity', 'action', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'separate', 'existing', 'band', 'no-holds-barred', 'gangster', 'flicks', 'director', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'skillfully', 'film', 'as', 'tense', 'impossibly', 'lengthy', 'red', 'light', 'life-or-death', 'stolen', 'car', 'getaway.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",Public Enemies
1283989,A2YW1TL9ZR3URI,B002QEHPQA,"The Mad Bostonian ""Steve""","[4, 7]","In Regards to THE BLU RAYHere's an update, I just got this on blu ray, now don't know if I'm the only one but is anyone's copy of this movie the sound muddled in some parts and seem have to turn the volume way up in order to hear what the actors are saying? And grainy in some scenes, first time having a blu ray disc that is very sub-par. This really annoys me, because in the theater it was the same... muddled sound in some parts, loud in others, just curious if other people are experiencing the same thing??? Thought maybe the studio would have cleaned up the sound and make it more clear. That is Why I only give this Blu Ray disc 2 stars.Anyways here's my reviewI wanted to like this movie when I saw it in theaters, the trailer was good, strong actors, everyone loves Johnny Depp, And I like Michael Mann, and it was a historical piece, a look on crime wave of the 1930s.Ok, so the movie was stylish, nice camera work, good acting from Depp and Bale, Bale actually not growling his lines like in Dark Knight and T4... hahaha.This is what I had a problem with, a 2 1/2 hour or so movie condensing the crime spree of Dillinger and based on the book which is 500 pages or so that chronically and rightly depicts the events in true order.The movie itself is so historically inaccurate, just so it fits on ""Hollywood"" storyline. I thought Mann would do a better job to get historical facts straight. I do understand there needs to be room for poetic license and all.For instance: Baby Face Nelson is killed at the Little Bohemia Hide out by Agent Purvis, actually he is killed in 1934 in Chicago by FBIPretty Boyd Floyd was killed Oct 22nd 1934 3 months AFTER Dillinger is killed, not in the beginning of the filmThe scene with Hoover and the Senate Sub committee did not happen until 1936Ok you get the picture, there's tons more factual errors, and I know this is a movie based on true events and the book. Everything must be condensed and fit. The movie is enjoyable, with a nice blues soundtrack with Otis Taylor having 2 tracks on the soundtrack.Again this is Michael Mann, who I think his best movie achievement was Heat, I did like Collateral, where those movies were character driven movies, where this just scratches the surface. Again it's Mann, style and action is his motifs and it shows here, more so with the action and events than with the characters.What we get is, Yes Dillinger was a bank robber, yes he was shot outside the Biograph Theater, he seemed smug, and ruthless, seems this just scratches the surface here once again, thought this movie might go more into detail on who this man was, what made him tick? What we get is a dramatized over view of his exploits and not about Dillinger himself. Maybe I was hoping for a deeper story here. Depp was good with what he had, and Marion Cotillard is stunningly beautiful. If you want to know more read the book by all means. One reason to see it, the costumes, everything right from the 1930s, guns, clothing, cars, pretty cool.I think a good gangster film with developed characters and strong story and good action... American Gangster with Denzel and Russell Crowe. I thought that was a terrific movie.So over all an ok movie that could have been great otherwise.

1283992,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B002QEHPQA,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 6]","**1/2I am a huge fan of Michael Mann. If you are a loyal reader, you know that ""Heat"" and ""Last of the Mohicans"" are two of my favorite films of all time. And ""Collateral"" was one of my favorite films of that year. Heck, even ""Miami Vice"" was fun to watch. And Johnny Depp seems to have one of the most loyal followings of any movie star since maybe Clark Gable. Christian Bale? On a hot streak and always interesting. So, their new collaboration ""Public Enemies"" would seem like a sure bet.""Public Enemies"" has some really good elements and the film has a lot that simply doesn't work. In the end, I guess this makes the film a wash. Which is rare for Mann.Johnny Depp plays John Dillinger, the celebrated gangster who proficiently robbed banks during the Great Depression and became a hero for the downtrodden masses. As the film opens, Depp leads a highly choreographed prison breakout, freeing the rest of his crew from an Indiana prison. Then, the crime spree resumes. Dillinger and his crew execute their plans, quickly entering and leaving the targeted bank, refusing to take the money of the working class depositors. And because he works hard, he plays hard. Naturally, he attracts the attention of the police and the government and the head of the newly formed, struggling Federal Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup). Hoover doesn't receive the necessary funding he wants from Congress, they believe his agency is ineffective, and realizes capturing Dillinger would be a good way of proving his floundering agencies worth. He turns to Agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) who successfully tracked and killed Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum, ""G.I. Joe"", ""Fighting"", ""Step Up""). Purvis relocates to Chicago and sets about capturing the Public Enemy Number 1. When Dillinger and his men visit a nightclub, he spots Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard, Oscar winner for ""La Vie En Rose"") and they begin a torrid relationship. As the cops and the FBI close in, Dillinger finds he has another group becoming increasingly upset with him; the Mob. Dillinger works frantically to stay one step ahead but will not give up his relationship with Billie.What I really like about Mann's films is that he isn't afraid to use technique, to show what skills and tools he has at his disposal. Usually, these little flourishes serve to make his films more interesting, allowing the visuals to enhance the story, to help define the characters. Mann has been using High Def Video to shoot his films, giving him the ability to capture the image of the film in a very different way. This super sensitive method of capturing light has lent itself well to films like ""Collateral"" and ""Miami Vice"", two films set largely at night, in large cities and centering on crime and criminals. This technique allows Mann to, for instance, capture an extreme close-up of Tom Cruise while keeping Jamie Foxx, who is standing about twenty feet away, also in focus. Or, when Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are on a rooftop discussing their latest stake-out with other members of their squad, we see an extreme close-up of Crockett with Tubbs a few feet away and other members of their crew standing in the distance, all in focus, all contributing to the discussion. Mann uses this camera and many of these same techniques in ""Public Enemies"" but it isn't a good fit. Given the time period, you really expect a different type of look, a look more in keeping with the time, something more evocative of the 30s. Because the look doesn't really fit, these same techniques draw attention to themselves, making them seem artificial, unnecessary and obtrusive. Everything they aren't when Mann uses them in a modern day tale about crime and criminals.Another benefit of the smaller, more sensitive camera is monetary. Because he is shooting on video, he saves the cost of expensive film stock. And he can do ""set-ups"" faster. Until this film, this camera has served Mann well.There is an extended sequence set at a lodge in the woods where Dillinger and his men are hiding out after a robbery. As the camera moves across cars approaching the building, the headlights flare across the screen, leaving a light trail. Later, when Dillinger is staring in to the forest, we see Depp in an extreme close up; his features very noticeable, if slightly grainy do to the low level of light. These are interesting shots and good techniques, but they don't fit in the time period. You see the characters driving old cars, wearing vintage clothing, trying to approximate the 30s, and because it is shot on high def video, it looks like a parody, like a high school play.Another problem with ""Enemies"" is that we are expected to take everything at face value. Dillinger becomes obsessed with Frechette, threatening his freedom to spend time with her. There simply isn't enough time devoted to their relationship to make this believable or interesting. Their initial meeting, in a nightclub where Billie works as a hat check girl is interesting. But as she continues to rebuff his advances, I felt like we were going to see an in-depth representation of their relationship, but the next time we see them together, they are both head over heels for each other. It almost seems like Mann cut a few sequences out.This is not the only example of this. We are introduced to Melvin Purvis (Bale), as he hunts down Pretty Boy Floyd. This capture gives him a certain notoriety and makes him Hoover's chosen one to hunt for Dillinger. But Mann and his writers seem to be hinting Purvis is obsessed with the criminals. He will stop at nothing to capture them. The problem is that we are given the outline of this character, yet provided with few, if any details to support this outline. Sure we watch him doggedly pursue Dillinger. But we don't know where he came from or why he is now the poster child for Hoover.Depp is always watchable and he lights up the screen as Dillinger. Even so, the character is drawn with broad strokes, with Depp giving the character a Robin Hood feel. At one point, he tells a man standing in a bank, wearing coveralls, to keep his money, they are there for the bank's money, not his. This sort of attitude helps to cement his persona with the public, a persona the government and Hoover are very adamant about quashing.As Depp runs through the story, he displays a certain amount of 'derring-do'. After meticulously planning each job, he and his men go through each step like clockwork. Also, Depp shows us that Dillinger went for everything he wanted. When he sees something he wants, he goes for it.I think it is great that Depp wants to play so many larger than life characters (his next collaboration with Tim Burton has him playing the Mad Hatter in ""Alice In Wonderland"") and he is very good at it. But he needs to remember to find some trace of the inner character as he has done so well in ""Edward Scissorhands"", the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Sweeney Todd"".Dillinger attends a screening of ""Manhattan Melodrama"" starring Clark Gable as a gangster, William Powell as his buddy, a lawyer and Myrna Loy as the woman torn between them. As the sequence plays out, Mann keeps returning to shots of Depp, with a slight grin on his face and a moustache strangely reminiscent of Gable, indicating that Dillinger was what? Self-aware and had a feeling he was about to be killed? I'm not sure. I'm not sure how anyone could know what Dillinger was thinking or feeling and it would all have to be conjecture.Bale is interesting, but he isn't able to infuse the character with more than a couple of levels of back-story. Do I think this is Bale's fault? No. All of the characters in the film seem to be created in broad strokes, no one seems three dimensional and fully developed. Bale certainly conveys Purvis' intensity, his desire to apprehend criminals, but we don't get a picture of any other part of his character. A coda at the end of the film hints at something deeper, more disturbing, but this isn't really developed over the course of the film.Billy Crudup makes an appearance as Hoover and he gives the most interesting performance in the film. This is pretty amazing when you look at the amount of screen time he has and the fact ""Enemies stars Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. But in his few short scenes, he hints at the manipulation, the megalomania, the duplicity in the man we would later learn so much about. A couple of glances at his ""assistant"" also pique our interest at his relationships and how undercover he had to keep his 'alternative lifestyle'.Mann and his writers have created a film that seems to be more like a Cliff Notes version of the film we would expect from the director. Why should we expect something different from Mann? This is the same director who took what could have/ should have been a normal cops and robbers film and made it into the masterpiece that is ""Heat"". Every single character in this film has a back-story, something we learn about their background, their motivations and the part they play in the overall story. Add to this a bunch of great, expertly filmed and choreographed action scenes and you have a masterpiece and the best Cops and Robbers film ever made.In ""Enemies"", It is also more than a little distracting to watch the parade of notable actors Mann has assembled, including Stephen Dorff, Channing Tatum, Lili Taylor, Giovanni Ribisi, Shawn Hatosy, Leelee Sobieski, many of whom only appear for a few minutes before disappearing, In a way, this only serves to help make the film seem all the more superficial, as though Mann wasn't interested in going beneath the surface, trying to get at the core of the characters and the story. This parade of actors only draws attention to the fact that none of them is playing a fully developed character; they are merely a face on screen.In ""Public Enemies"", Mann brings us expertly choreographed action scenes, but because the character development is so lacking, the film feels flat and lackluster, much like the barren landscape Dillinger and his men travel through during their getaways.It is a rare misstep for Mann.",2,"A Disappointing Effort from Mann, Depp and Bale",1248220800,"07 22, 2009",2009,10128,"['**1/2I', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'are', 'loyal',

It's not that Public Enemies was a bad movies, but a lot of people panned it because they expected a lot more from a 100 million dollar movie, starting Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, and they have a point. The story was flawed right from the beginning because the true story behind it really wasn't that interesting. The filmmakers tried to get people to watch it, by saying that Dillinger and Purvis were comparable to Capone and Ness, but that's not true. In reality, they had almost no interaction with each other and in the movie, whenever they were together, all they did was shoot at each other. There wasn't any chemistry between them, because their supposed rivalry was a fictions element added to an otherwise true story. The film should have focused on infamous bank robber, John Dillinger, but instead it focuses on the FBI hunt for him and his life on the run, long after the bulk of his crimes had been committed. Johnny Depp portrays Dillinger in an attempt to go back to being a legitimate actor instead of a Disney puppet, and he fails miserably. This guy can be one hell of actor, when the role fits his personality, but John Dillinger does not. Depp is an emotionless mess of mumbled lines that almost completely destroy the film. Thankfully, Christian Bale was much better and far more interesting. Public Enemies had big expectations, an all-star cast, and a huge budget, but it turned out to be an average film. That's what had people so upset, because had this been an independent film, they would have been okay with it. The fact that Public Enemies was billed as the next Untouchables, but fails to deliver even a single memorable scene just destroys any credibility the film had going for it.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1384214400,"11 12, 2013",2013,1879,"['producers', 'film', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'modern', 'version', 'Untouchables', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'film', 'will', 'tell', 'far', 'not', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'was', 'bad', 'movies', 'lot', 'people', 'panned', 'expected', 'lot', 'more', '100', 'million', 'dollar', 'movie', 'starting', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'have', 'point', 'story', 'was', 'flawed', 'right', 'beginning', 'true', 'story', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'filmmakers', 'tried', 'get', 'people', 'watch', 'saying', 'Dillinger', 'Purvis', 'were', 'comparable', 'Capone', 'Ness', 'not', 'true', 'reality', 'had', 'almost', 'interaction', 'other', 'movie', 'whenever', 'were', 'together', 'did', 'was', 'shoot', 'other', 'was', ""n't"", 'chemistry', 'supposed', 'rivalry', 'was', 'fictions', 'element', 'added', 'otherwise', 'true', 'story', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'focused', 'infamous', 'bank', 'robber', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'instead', 'FBI', 'hunt', 'life', 'run', 'long', 'bulk', 'crimes', 'had', 'been', 'committed', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Dillinger', 'attempt', 'go', 'back', 'being', 'legitimate', 'actor', 'instead', 'Disney', 'puppet', 'miserably', 'guy', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'hell', 'actor', 'when', 'role', 'personality', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'not', 'Depp', 'emotionless', 'mess', 'mumbled', 'lines', 'almost', 'completely', 'destroy', 'film', 'Thankfully', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'had', 'big', 'expectations', 'all-star', 'cast', 'huge', 'budget', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'average', 'film', 'what', 'had', 'people', 'so', 'upset', 'had', 'been', 'independent', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'okay', 'fact', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'was', 'billed', 'next', 'Untouchables', 'deliver', 'even', 'single', 'memorable', 'scene', 'just', 'credibility', 'film', 'had', 'going']",Public Enemies

He was an intelligent young man who started in Indian and moved cross country during the early 30's to make history. This film however does not play as a biography, rather a character summary. It gives us a look at Dillinger what he was like, as being in 2009 its hard to say, but Depp actually researched where he was born (Just a few miles from Depp's home town and found that he knew what Dillinger's accent would be like) After watching this movie I compared it to the real deal.

1283996,A3D9F6B1FB3CR,B002QEHPQA,"ToProtectAndServeAll ""Hope is a good thing, m...","[3, 4]","Nearly one hundred reviews for this film... and not one mentions what I wish to discuss.  Not surprising, really.  In fact, I missed it myself the first time I saw the film.  I experienced Public Enemies in the theatre upon its release, and came in with high expectations.  Michael Mann's films are (for me) always an experience to be savored, and once again I was not disappointed.  But I confess I missed it.  And I have no idea why.  Because it is so obvious.  What I am referring to is what I will call Mann's ""off center"" tendencies.  Now, I am not referring to Mann's political, moral or social views but more accurately, his penchant (at least in this film) for framing his actors dramatically to the left or right of the center of the screen.  From the opening moments - when we see Johnny Depp's John Dillinger (several months prior to achieving ""Public Enemy #1"" status) being ferried back to prison for what we will ultimately come to find out is a bloody prison break attempt - Mann sets his characters well off center.  And leaves them there.  Watching the film again last night, I saw this most clearly.  In fact, if you pay close attention, you will discover that Mann uses this technique throughout the two hour and twenty minute drama.  Shot after shot, frame after frame, we experience the rollicking, rumbling, scrambling, violent world that Dillinger and his crew inhabit as if we are sitting or standing right beside them.  And as I watched the film for a second time, it became shockingly apparent to me why Mann chose to do this.  He is showing us the entire world these men inhabit.  A complete world.Mann is known for his relentless pursuit of exacting detail, often going so far as to tell his actors what color and brand of socks their characters would choose to wear.  And with Enemies, cinematographer Dante Spinotti (who Mann has thankfully returned to working with) goes to great lengths to display all of Mann's eccentric efforts.  Whether it is a shot of Dillinger and his girlfriend Billie Frechette (achingly played by Marion Cotillard) seated at a crowded restaurant, a glimpse of Dillinger - double barreled and growling orders with a weapon in each hand - holding at bay both bank employees and customers alike, or a frame of FBI Agent Melvin Purvis (a lock jawed and in control Christian Bale) straining to shut out the tortured screams of a captured member of Dillinger's crew... Mann and Spinotti make certain to show viewers every inch of the world these loners drift in and out of.  We see not only the two young lovers sharing fleeting moments together, but we are allowed to see the world closing in around them.  We see not only Dillinger's expertise in his craft, but the fear and slight respect in the bank customer's eyes.  And finally, we see not only Purvis' angst and uncertainty surrounding the direction his job is taking him, but the gore and filth in which he is forced to produce results.  And in doing so, Mann succeeds in two things: The aforementioned entrance into this other world, and the emphasis on the loneliness and despair that each character feels throughout the film.  It is a remarkable achievement.  And I submit to you that Mann keeps his characters off center for the entirety of the film, with the stark exception of two occasions:One is when Dillinger - by now stripped of his one true love and oozing pain out of every pore - steels himself in a pronounced display of balls (there is no other word for it) and marches brazenly into the Chicago Police Department's Dillinger Task Force squad room.  From the second Dillinger steps into the elevator, Mann and Spinotti place him front and center in this moment.  Watch as he sidles through the squad room unnoticed, glancing at painful images of his fallen crew, his bloody path of destruction, and finally, himself.  In each shot, Mann plants Dillinger squarely in your face.  Right up until he asks a group of lazy cops the score of the radio broadcast baseball game.  Oh, and don't think for a moment these flatfoots even notice who he is.  And out the door he rolls... back into his off center world.The second such time is the far more painful - and bloody - confrontation between Purvis' team of hired hands and Dillinger himself in the ill-fated final moments of the film.  Watch as Dillinger - smirking yet a bit spent - exits the soon-to-be famous Biograph Theatre and walks ever forward toward a fate we are led to believe he has already accepted... until he turns to face the men he senses behind him.  At this moment Mann again thrusts Dillinger directly into your face.  And what was to the left and to the right of the man become far less important, until the fatal shots ring out and Dillinger falls, mortally wounded, to the blood soaked sidewalk.With the exception of these two instances, Mann's shot selection reminds us of what lies just outside each character's peripheral vision.

1283998,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002QEHPQA,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","In ""Public Enemies"" Johnny Depp plays John Dillinger, one of the most notorious Depression-era outlaws. The 140 minute movie directed by Michael Mann covers most of the major events that happened in his life - his escape from the Indiana State Prison to the ""Woman in Red"" episode (actually, it was orange, according to the film), and the director didn't forget to include the shot of Dillinger jumping over the bank counter. Obviously the filmmakers took great care to re-create the early 1930s and Dante Spinotti's photography captures its atmosphere.However, like in ""Heat"" and ""Collateral,"" director Michael Mann seems more interested in the two opposing personalities represented by Dillinger and the ace FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), than the life story of John Dillinger itself. His usual slow-burn approach works most effectively during the film's action scenes, setting up the mood slowly before leading us to the violent climax.But there is something missing here, though where the weakness is, it is hard to pinpoint. Very charismatic Johnny Depp did a great job of becoming the legendary character, but his character doesn't explain why Dillinger had become a national legend. Oscar winner Marion Cotillard appears as his girlfriend Billie Frechette, but their romantic relation only help slow down the pace of the film. The film also features a strong supporting cast including Billy Crudup (as J. Edgar Hoover), Stephen Dorff, Stephen Lang, Giovanni Ribisi, David Wenham and very brief Leelee Sobieski, but not much time is given to them and the characters they play.Thanks to the impressive acting from the leads, ""Public Enemies"" remains watchable, but despite its outstanding action scenes, the film is clearly not Mann's best, with so much potential (with Depp and Bale) wasted in the unfocused script that needs a compelling drama.",3,Johnny Depp Is Outstanding But the Film Lacks a Compelling Drama,1264204800,"01 23, 2010",2010,1862,"['Public', 'Enemies', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'one', 'most', 'notorious', 'Depression-era', 'outlaws', '140', 'minute', 'movie', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'most', 'major', 'events', 'happened', 'life', 'escape', 'Indiana', 'State', 'Prison', 'Woman', 'Red', 'episode', 'actually', 'was', 'orange', 'according', 'film', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'forget', 'include', 'shot', 'Dillinger', 'jumping', 'bank', 'counter', 'Obviously', 'filmmakers', 'took', 'great', 'care', 're-create', 'early', '1930s', 'Dante', 'Spinotti', 'photography', 'atmosphere.However', 'Heat', 'Collateral', 'director', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'more', 'interested', 'two', 'opposing', 'personalities', 'represented', 'Dillinger', 'ace', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'life', 'story', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'usual', 'slow-burn', 'approach', 'most', 'effectively', 'film', 'action', 'scenes', 'setting', 'up', 'mood', 'slowly', 'leading', 'violent', 'climax.But', 'something', 'missing', 'here', 'where', 'weakness', 'hard', 'pinpoint', 'Very', 'charismatic', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'becoming', 'legendary', 'character', 'character', ""n't"", 'explain', 'why', 'Dillinger', 'had', 'become', 'national', 'legend', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'girlfriend', 'Billie', 'Frechette', 'romantic', 'relation', 'only', 'help', 'slow', 'down', 'pace', 'film', 'film', 'also', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'David', 'Wenham', 'very', 'brief', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'not', 'much', 'time', 'given', 'characters', 'play.Thanks', 'impressive', 'acting', 'leads', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'watchable', 'outstanding', 'action', 'scenes', 'film', 'clearly', 'not', 'Mann', 'best', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'Depp', 'Bale', 'wasted', 'unfocused', 'script', 'compelling', 'drama']",Public Enemies
1283999,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002QEHPQA,Turfseer,"[2, 3]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Here we go again with another John Dillinger movie. There have been a fair number of them over the years and the question arises, do we really need another one? The answer is, not really! But if one is insistent on making another movie about the legendary Depression-era bank robber, as Michael Mann has done here, one should at least provide us with a convincing protagonist as well as a realistic atmosphere.One of Director Mann's big mistakes was to film 'Public Enemies"" in high definition. It's ironic that the original concept was to shoot the film as a TV mini-series based on Bryan Burrough's non-fiction book about early 30s gangsters and the origins of the FBI. The HD cinematography gives the film too modern a look as though we're watching an HBO special. What's more, some of the action is hard to make out during the scenes shot during the night. I also found the soundtrack to be irritating as the music was also much too modern at times. The fault lies with composer Elliot Goldenthal who admitted that his job was ""chiefly composing dramatic music that didn't necessarily have to sound like it came from 1931 or 1933. It could be timeless.""But Mann's biggest mistake was to cast Johnny Depp as Dillinger. Depp might be good playing offbeat characters such as Captain Jack Sparrow or Ichabod Crane but he's no gangster. Just look at his smooth, almost feminine face--it's a face of an artistic type not of a criminal or someone who has experience dealing with the underworld. Before he became successful as an actor, Depp was involved in the rock music world as a musician and songwriter.No doubt Depp was drawn to the films' scenarists conception of Dillinger as a misunderstood romantic. Their Dillinger makes it a point to cover a female hostage with a coat following a bank robbery. He's also adamant about not committing any kidnappings as bank robberies are his modus operandi. The only time we see the Depp Dillinger get really violent is when he slugs a man who's acting impolite toward his love interest, coat-check girl Billie Frechette. Depp Dillinger's chivalry reaches its apotheosis when he makes tender love to Billie in an early drawn-out sex scene. Now the real Dillinger was known to be quite personable and perhaps at times could be chivalrous--but what's missing here from Mr. Depp is the notion that Dillinger was a dangerous psychopath and capable of many fits of violence.There is a complete disconnect in this film with Dillinger's character (who we're supposed to sympathize with) and his actions. Somehow Dillinger is excused for his behavior because deep down he's simply misunderstood--he's not really violent. In his place is a surrogate--Baby Face Nelson (very convincingly played by Stephen Graham) who we can blame for the violence while the Depp Dillinger gets his free pass. Even lawman Purvis' associates end up being worse than Dillinger--they torture one of the gang members to extract information and rough up Billie before Purvis intercedes on her behalf.Another big mistake in this script is that it totally lacks humor. Compare the humorless Depp Dillinger with the wise-cracking psychopath conceived by Warren Oates in John Millius' 1973 take on the notorious outlaw. In the 1973 ""Dillinger"", Oates is far more believable because he can be both funny (likeable) and scary. Sometimes the violence is too over the top when he slugs Billie (played by Michelle Phillips) in the face but there are enough moments of black humor that give the 1973 film its charm. Despite being too old for the part, Ben Johnson was a far superior Melvin Purvis in the '73 version to Christian Bale's virtual automaton. Johnson's phone conversation with Oates is hilarious as he makes it clear that their relationship is 'nothing personal' and everything is kept on a 'friendly' level. On the other hand, Bale, with no coolness whatsoever, simply informs Depp while he's in the jail cell that the only time he'll get out is once he's executed!Just as in the 1973 version, all the main bases are touched in the Dillinger story: Dillinger's arrest and escape from the Crown Point, Indiana jail; the shootout at the Little Bohemia Lodge and Dillinger's death in front of the Biograph theater. What the new film has over its predecessor is some nice on-location cinematography. However, the opening scene gives more credit to Dillinger than is his due: he never directly participated in the escape of his associates at the Indiana State Prison.My main problem with 'Public Enemies' was that it deliberately attempted to distort and perhaps glorify a criminal who terrorized innocent people. Even if Dillinger never killed anyone (although he supposedly was responsible for the death of at least one bank guard), good citizens feared for their lives whenever he robbed a bank or took people hostage. What's more, 'Public Enemies' only presents the basic outline of the Dillinger story. We never get a sense of a fleshed-out human being, replete with all the behind-the scene tidbits that could have made this film something truly special. It's hard to believe that Michael Mann is the same director who gave us the excellent 'Last of the Mohicans'. But the aging process will take its toll on even some of the most creative among us.",2,Depp serves up chivalrous romantic in place of wise-cracking psychopath,1289174400,"11 8,

However, the film is actually pretty uninteresting. It is slow-paced and while there are some terrific actors in it, they all felt wasted in their roles. Christian Bale's character could have literally be played by anyone else. He was basically phoning in his performance. Very obvious but sad since he is such a great actor. Not his best role-in fact, probably one of his worst. More wasted actors include Billy Crudup and David Wenham(who had like 2 lines I think and I barely understood a word he said). As for the always talented Johnny Depp, well, performance-wise he was just fine. But I felt nothing for his character, neither sympathy or excitement. He always seems to be enjoying his roles, no matter what he does, but again, not his best here.Plot-wise, well honestly, there is more talk than action. A couple of bank robberies, a fun prison escape, a gun battle-Nothing we haven't seen before. Even if you don't know the story behind Depp's character or his comrades, you sort of can guess what will happen and who will end up being killed. As for Marion Cotillard's character, I'm not sure what sort of effect she had on Dillinger in real life, so I can't really comment on how factual her performance was or her role in history, but again, she seemed sort of unnecessary.Before I saw the film, I read about how grainy the film looks and how visually beautiful it was. Um no. It is very dark in some parts and it's hard to see certain things in alot of scenes. Not impressed with the cinematography at all.Overall, I was dissapointed and somewhat bored with this film. I thought it would be far more interesting but it just felt like it was missing something important.",3,Dull,1263772800,"01 18, 2010",2010,1749,"['Public', 'Enemies', 'based', 'factual', 'events', 'real-life', 'criminal', 'However', 'film', 'actually', 'pretty', 'uninteresting', 'slow-paced', 'are', 'terrific', 'actors', 'felt', 'wasted', 'roles', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'literally', 'be', 'played', 'anyone', 'else', 'was', 'basically', 'phoning', 'performance', 'Very', 'obvious', 'sad', 'such', 'great', 'actor', 'Not', 'best', 'role-in', 'fact', 'probably', 'one', 'worst', 'More', 'wasted', 'actors', 'include', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'David', 'Wenham', 'who', 'had', '2', 'lines', 'think', 'barely', 'understood', 'word', 'said', 'always', 'talented', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'well', 'performance-wise', 'was', 'just', 'fine', 'felt', 'nothing', 'character', 'sympathy', 'excitement', 'always', 'be', 'enjoying', 'roles', 'matter', 'what', 'again', 'not', 'best', 'here.Plot-wise', 'well', 'honestly', 'more', 'talk', 'action', 'couple', 'bank', 'robberies', 'fun', 'prison', 'escape', 'gun', 'battle-Nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'Depp', 'character', 'comrades', 'sort', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'who', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'killed', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'character', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'sort', 'effect', 'had', 'Dillinger', 'real', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'comment', 'how', 'factual', 'performance', 'was', 'role', 'history', 'again', 'seemed', 'sort', 'unnecessary.Before', 'saw', 'film', 'read', 'how', 'grainy', 'film', 'looks', 'how', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'was', 'Um', 'very', 'dark', 'parts', 'hard', 'see', 'certain', 'things', 'alot', 'scenes', 'Not', 'impressed', 'cinematography', 'all.Overall', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'somewhat', 'bored', 'film', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'missing', 'something', 'important']",Public Enemies
1284003,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B002QEHPQA,V. Berk,"[5, 7]","Public Enemies is an alright docu-crime-thriller that, though well-made, ends up coming out dry.  Many of the scenes are well paced, but in its running time the film feels like a very rushed overview of the final years of John Dillinger.  What I mean to say is that this is a good movie, but you probably won't leave the theater feeling like you've learned anything about John Dillinger, other than trivial facts.  The movie never really gives Johnny Depp a chance to shape the character into a believable icon because as I previously stated this film feels more like a dramatized overview of Dillinger's career instead of focusing on the man himself.Now, Johnny Depp is a fine actor, and he reminds us in this movie that he isn't only a go-to man for quirky, weird, whimsical, and bizarre characters.  In Public Enemies Depp reminds us that he is talented as a traditional actor and that he is still one of the best in Hollywood today.  The problem is the script he is given for Public Enemies never lets him expand on anything regarding John Dellinger as a person.  In Ridley Scott's `American Gangster' Denzel Washington was given a chance to really emphasize the qualities he felt reflected his view of Frank Lucas.  Public enemies, Johnny Depp never truly gets to define what he feels are the most important aspects of his portrayal of Dellinger because often the film gets too caught up in the action and events instead of its characters.Christian Bale bounces back after a sub-par performance in `Terminator: Salvation' and it's good to see him working his voice manipulation ability again, because I for one was beginning to think he'd gotten stuck on his Batman-style growl.  Playing the FBI agent pursuing Dillinger he is an interesting character due to his dedication and could have been a really interesting character, but like Depp, Bale never really gets a chance to try and expand on his character.The music isn't anything you haven't heard before in previous crime films of this sort, but for the most part it works.  I wouldn't buy the soundtrack to this film, but it certainly didn't take away from the experience.  Also, songs from the 30s are played throughout, and most of the time they manage to fit into the story's many montage scenes very well.Director Michael Mann seems a tad bit off when compared to some of his previous films.  He often goes for a look that makes the audience feel that they're in the middle of everything, and that's good in small stretches, but I felt he used this technique too often and I found myself growing a tad bit dizzy at times, and had a desire to see what was going on in the shootouts.  I found it strange, that with his recent films such as `Collateral', where the characters had been the center-focus of the entire film, he could then make a movie about one of the most infamous criminal minds and have it be more about the history than the characters who lived it.The thing that is most fascinating about this film is the costumes and sets.  The men and women behind these really outdid themselves and created a very authentic view of 1930s Chicago.  This aspect of the film alone makes it worth seeing!  Every costume and set seems to have been made with the upmost attention to detail, and the final result is very pleasing to the eye.The final product in an okay docu-drama on the life of one of America's most infamous criminals, but in the end you really don't discover anything about John Dillinger that you couldn't have found out by looking him up on Wikipedia.  So this is a pretty film to look at, and with Depp and Bale it's a good way to introduce those unfamiliar with Dillinger to the criminal, but if you were looking for a character study on the bank robber you may find yourself a tad-bit disappointed.I wouldn't come close to calling Public Enemies one of the best movies of the summer, or of the year, but when compared to several other films that are currently being screened I would still highly recommend it.  With movies like `Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' out there your money is best spent on Michael Mann's Public Enemies.",4,Overview of a criminal mastermind,1246838400,"07 6, 2009",2009,4118,"['Public', 'Enemies', 'alright', 'docu-crime-thriller', 'well-made', 'up', 'coming', 'out', 'dry', 'Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'paced', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'feels', 'very', 'rushed', 'overview', 'final', 'years', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'What', 'mean', 'say', 'good', 'movie', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'theater', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'anything', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'other', 'trivial', 'facts', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'chance', 'shape', 'character', 'believable', 'icon', 'previously', 'stated', 'film', 'more', 'dramatized', 'overview', 'Dillinger', 'career', 'instead', 'focusing', 'man', 'himself.Now', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'fine', 'actor', 'movie', ""n't"", 'only', 'go-to', 'man', 'quirky', 'weird', 'whimsical', 'bizarre', 'characters', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'Depp', 'talented', 'traditional', 'actor', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'problem', 'script', 'given', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'never', 'expand', 'anything', 'regarding', 'John', 'Dellinger', 'person', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'American', 'Gangster', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'was', 'given', 'chance', 'really', 'emphasize', 'qualities', 'felt', 'reflected', 'view', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'Public', 'enemies', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'never', 'truly', 'define', 'what', 'are', 'most', 'important', 'aspects', 'portrayal', 'Dellinger', 'often', 'film', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'action', 'events', 'instead', 'characters.Christian', 'Bale', 'bounces', 'back', 'sub-par', 'performance', 'Terminator', 'Salvation', 'good', 'see', 'working', 'voice', 'manipulation', 'ability', 'again', 'one', 'was', 'beginning', 'think', ""'d"", 'gotten', 'stuck', 'Batman-style', 'growl', 'Playing', 'FBI', 'agent', 'pursuing', 'Dillinger', 'interesting', 'character', 'due', 'dedication', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'interesting', 'character', 'Depp', 'Bale', 'never', 'really', 'chance', 'try', 'expand', 'character.The', 'music', ""n't"", 'anything', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'previous', 'crime', 'films', 'sort', 'most', 'part', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'experience', 'Also', 'songs', '30s', 'are', 'played', 'most', 'time', 'manage', 'fit', 'story', 'many', 'montage', 'scenes', 'very', 'well.Director', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'tad', 'bit', 'when', 'compared', 'previous', 'films', 'often', 'look', 'audience', 'feel', ""'re"", 'middle', 'everything', 'good', 'small', 'stretches', 'felt', 'used', 'technique', 'too', 'often', 'found', 'growing', 'tad', 'bit', 'dizzy', 'times', 'had', 'desire', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'shootouts', 'found', 'strange', 'recent', 'films', 'such', 'Collateral', 'where', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'center-focus', 'entire', 'film', 'could', 'then', 'make', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'infamous', 'criminal', 'minds', 'have', 'be', 'more', 'history', 'characters', 'who', 'lived', 'it.The', 'thing', 'most', 'fascinating', 'film', 'costumes', 'sets', 'men', 'women', 'really', 'outdid', 'created', 'very', 'authentic', 'view', '1930s', 'Chicago', 'aspect', 'film', 'alone', 'worth', 'seeing', 'costume', 'set', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'upmost', 'attention', 'detail', 'final', 'result', 'very', 'pleasing', 'eye.The', 'final', 'product', 'okay', 'docu-drama', 'life', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'infamous', 'criminals', 'end', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'discover', 'anything', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'out', 'looking', 'up', 'Wikipedia', 'pretty', 'film', 'look', 'Depp', 'Bale', 'good', 'way', 'introduce', 'unfamiliar', 'Dillinger', 'criminal', 'were', 'looking', 'character', 'study', 'bank', 'may', 'find', 'tad-bit', 'disappointed.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'calling', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'summer', 'year', 'when', 'compared', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'currently', 'being', 'screened', 'would', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movies', 'Transformers', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'there', 'money', 'best', 'spent', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'Public', 'Enemies']",Public Enemies

1284012,A2SQZC62UZCZ7B,B002QEHPQA,Zenith,"[0, 0]","When I first heard that Michael Mann would be doing a film based on the John Dillinger story, I couldn't have been more excited. Mann is a great director, but in my opinion, his triumph was 1995's Heat, which I consider to be the greatest bank robbery movie ever made. The fact that he would be telling the story of arguably the most famous bank robber in American history meant that opening day, I was in a theater viewing Public Enemies. The moment the credits began to roll, all I could think was; ""well, that was underwhelming"".The brilliant staging and cinematography that helped make Heat such a memorable film are replaced with close-up handheld shots which cut down on the dramatic spectacle of the bank robberies and shootouts, and the powerhouse performances of De Niro and Pacino are replaced with a clearly bored Johnny Depp, and a shockingly mis-cast Christian Bale.I am personally not a fan of Johnny Depp, mostly as a result of his recent career, but I can't deny that he has given phenomenal performances in the past, and thus is fully capable of carrying a film is he puts his mind to it. However, he seems to be sleepwalking through the majority of the running time, remembering his lines well enough, but seeming to forget that an actor also has to affect the proper emotions to underscore those lines.Christian Bale is another actor who has the potential to be great in a role, but his short-coming is his lack of versatility. Bale shines brightest when he plays characters who are detached from reality, such as Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, and Trevor Reznik in The Machinist. However, he seems to flounder when it comes to playing the straight-forward hero, which is the role he is saddled with in Public Enemies.Both actors prove to be completely incapable of assuming a convincing Southern accent, and nowhere is this more apparent then in the scene where Melvin Purvis (Bale) interrogates Dillinger (Depp). It is written as a scene that highlights Purvis' sense of duty, and Dillinger's amorality, but the fact that both actors' accents are so slurred and overblown makes the entire scene unintentionally hilarious.The cinematography is probably the film's biggest short-coming, because rather then the big action set-pieces being meticulously staged and shot from a middle-distance to let the audience really absorb the spectacle, the majority of shots in these scenes are shot absurdly close, and many last for between five and ten seconds. This is meant to convey the frantic nature of the scenes, but it ends up becoming tedious very quickly.Public Enemies had the potential to be a great American crime classic, but the execution is so botched that the only true appeal of the film would be for those morbidly interested in the Dillinger story, and even then the numerous historical inaccuracies will drive most away.",2,A Horrible Disappointment,1373414400,"07 10, 2013",2013,2854,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'would', 'be', 'doing', 'film', 'based', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'excited', 'Mann', 'great', 'director', 'opinion', 'triumph', 'was', '1995', 'Heat', 'consider', 'be', 'greatest', 'bank', 'robbery', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'telling', 'story', 'arguably', 'most', 'famous', 'bank', 'robber', 'American', 'history', 'meant', 'opening', 'day', 'was', 'theater', 'viewing', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'moment', 'credits', 'began', 'roll', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'well', 'was', 'underwhelming', '.The', 'brilliant', 'staging', 'cinematography', 'helped', 'make', 'Heat', 'memorable', 'film', 'are', 'replaced', 'close-up', 'handheld', 'shots', 'cut', 'down', 'dramatic', 'spectacle', 'bank', 'robberies', 'shootouts', 'powerhouse', 'performances', 'De', 'Niro', 'Pacino', 'are', 'replaced', 'clearly', 'bored', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'shockingly', 'mis-cast', 'Christian', 'Bale.I', 'am', 'personally', 'not', 'fan', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'mostly', 'result', 'recent', 'career', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'given', 'phenomenal', 'performances', 'past', 'thus', 'fully', 'capable', 'carrying', 'film', 'mind', 'However', 'be', 'sleepwalking', 'majority', 'running', 'time', 'remembering', 'lines', 'well', 'enough', 'seeming', 'forget', 'actor', 'also', 'affect', 'proper', 'emotions', 'underscore', 'lines.Christian', 'Bale', 'actor', 'who', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'role', 'short-coming', 'lack', 'versatility', 'Bale', 'shines', 'brightest', 'when', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'detached', 'reality', 'such', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'American', 'Psycho', 'Trevor', 'Reznik', 'Machinist', 'However', 'flounder', 'when', 'playing', 'straight-forward', 'hero', 'role', 'saddled', 'Public', 'Enemies.Both', 'actors', 'prove', 'be', 'completely', 'incapable', 'assuming', 'convincing', 'Southern', 'accent', 'nowhere', 'more', 'apparent', 'then', 'scene', 'where', 'Melvin', 'Purvis', 'Bale', 'Dillinger', 'Depp', 'written', 'scene', 'Purvis', 'sense', 'duty', 'Dillinger', 'amorality', 'fact', 'actors', 'accents', 'are', 'so', 'slurred', 'overblown', 'entire', 'scene', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious.The', 'cinematography', 'probably', 'film', 'biggest', 'short-coming', 'rather', 'then', 'big', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'being', 'meticulously', 'staged', 'shot', 'middle-distance', 'let', 'audience', 'really', 'spectacle', 'majority', 'shots', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'absurdly', 'close', 'many', 'last', 'five', 'ten', 'seconds', 'meant', 'convey', 'frantic', 'nature', 'scenes', 'up', 'becoming', 'tedious', 'very', 'quickly.Public', 'Enemies', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'American', 'crime', 'classic', 'execution', 'so', 'botched', 'only', 'true', 'appeal', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'morbidly', 'interested', 'Dillinger', 'story', 'even', 'then', 'numerous', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'will', 'drive', 'most', 'away']",Public Enemies
