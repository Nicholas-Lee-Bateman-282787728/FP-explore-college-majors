489926,AURWY3GPQ0S86,B0000039D3,J. J. Carew,"[23, 26]","When I was 13, I began reading Danielle Steel novels.  Most follow the same path and offer few variations.  So when Jewels was released, I did not buy it right away.  Then I saw the miniseries on TV and knew it HAD to be part of my library, both video AND book library.Why?  For one, Anthony Andrews is the perfect fit for his role.  For fans of Andrews, one only has to remember that he played King Edward VIII in The Woman He Loved and what an excellent job he did in that role.  He was also stunning in The Scarlet Pimpernel and Ivanhoe, and period pieces seem to suit this well-trained actor.  Annette O'Toole is also well-cast as the strong-willed American woman who falls in love with the man in line for the crown (granted, he is 13th in line for the throne).The story provides all the Steel conventions, but it does not seem old-hand when staged in this movie. Even if you are not a fan of Steel's work, the story is compelling.Other Danielle Steel adaptations pale in comparison to Jewels.  This is by far the best adaptation of her work.  The blossoming of love, the separation of war, the agony of loss, the trials and tribulations of parenthood, the reinvention of one's self, the survival of one family.

489929,A1V4PT1BKQIUB1,B0000039D3,MJ,"[1, 1]","I won't bother wasting time describing the plot of Jewels, it has already been done in previous reviews.  Part One of Jewels and the first 30 minutes of Part Two are really the only parts of the movie worth watching. I really enjoy Part One, as I am a huge Anthony Andrews fan, he dies about 30 minutes into Part Two. After William(Anthony Andrews) dies the movie disolves into a soapy sorry mess.  Annette O'Toole does a good job, but I will admit her shrieking during child birth and at other times is ear splitting and grinds on the nerves.  I usually watch until William dies and then I turn it off.I'm giving Jewels 4 stars for Part One and the first 30 minutes or so of Part Two.  They are worth 4 stars and worth watching.",4,Jewels that sparkle then fade.......,1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,729,"['wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'wasting', 'time', 'describing', 'plot', 'Jewels', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'previous', 'reviews', 'Part', 'One', 'Jewels', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'Part', 'Two', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'parts', 'movie', 'watching', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Part', 'One', 'am', 'huge', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'fan', '30', 'minutes', 'Part', 'Two', 'William', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'movie', 'soapy', 'sorry', 'mess', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'good', 'job', 'will', 'admit', 'shrieking', 'child', 'birth', 'other', 'times', 'ear', 'splitting', 'grinds', 'nerves', 'usually', 'watch', 'William', 'dies', 'then', 'turn', ""'m"", 'giving', 'Jewels', '4', 'stars', 'Part', 'One', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'Part', 'Two', 'are', 'worth', '4', 'stars', 'worth', 'watching']",Danielle Steel's Jewels VHS

All are sweeping historical romances and all are very, very good, if you want to watch a chick flick. Of the three, Jewels is probably tops followed by The Ring. Zoya comes in as my third favorite.
