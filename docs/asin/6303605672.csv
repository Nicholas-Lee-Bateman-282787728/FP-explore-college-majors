Beautiful Ms. Rogers is rightfully confusing and the dialogue became almost believable being carried along with their performances.  I'm guessing the sidekick was meant for comic relief but he became distracting, almost slapstick.  I couldn't figure out what a cool but crazy cuckoo guy like LaPaglia's character would be doing with a kid that brought him to the brink of folly every time the kid talked or breathed.  Otherwise, it was a good, unusual, and well-acted picture.",4,Young and pretty and THIN Anthony Lapaglia was menacing and fragile,1404432000,"07 4, 2014",2014,548,"['Young', 'pretty', 'THIN', 'Anthony', 'Lapaglia', 'was', 'menacing', 'fragile', 'Beautiful', 'Ms.', 'Rogers', 'rightfully', 'confusing', 'dialogue', 'became', 'almost', 'believable', 'being', 'carried', 'performances', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'sidekick', 'was', 'meant', 'comic', 'relief', 'became', 'distracting', 'almost', 'slapstick', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'cool', 'crazy', 'cuckoo', 'guy', 'LaPaglia', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'doing', 'kid', 'brought', 'brink', 'folly', 'time', 'kid', 'talked', 'breathed', 'Otherwise', 'was', 'good', 'unusual', 'well-acted', 'picture']",Bulletproof Heart aka Killer  VHS

This movie stands out in my mind because of the depth with which the main characters are played.  Both Anthony LaPaglia and Mimi Rogers do a superb job in their parts... LaPaglia as the hitman with a heart, and Rogers as the woman awaiting death.  Both of them are caught in such hopeless lives, and their methods of dealing with them are heartbreaking to watch...This is one of those films where the characters grab you, and for some strange reason you feel like you can understand them, despite all the seeming differences... This movie will haunt you if you let it.",5,"Beautiful, twisted, and sad",946684800,"01 1, 2000",2000,674,"['been', 'awhile', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'still', 'remember', 'way', 'hit', 'quite', 'vividly', 'movie', 'out', 'mind', 'depth', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'do', 'superb', 'job', 'parts', 'LaPaglia', 'hitman', 'heart', 'Rogers', 'woman', 'awaiting', 'death', 'are', 'caught', 'such', 'hopeless', 'lives', 'methods', 'dealing', 'are', 'heartbreaking', 'watch', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'characters', 'grab', 'strange', 'reason', 'feel', 'can', 'understand', 'seeming', 'differences', 'movie', 'will', 'haunt', 'let']",Bulletproof Heart aka Killer  VHS
381511,ADA91975K0DL2,6303605672,Paige Turner,"[0, 0]","This unforgettable tragedy of a mob killer's stab at love is a glossy and gritty glimpse of redemption that's the only heaven he'll ever know, if the cruel cost is not too great to bear.Anthony LaPaglia is a hardcore hitman, true to his code and without remorse. His cold heart is bulletproof, allowing no attachments, no desire, no regret. Feeling nothing is a professional necessity grown strong in his empty world, until he finds himself deep in the abyss. His contract tonight is a glittering socialite.Mimi Rogers is the glamorous woman whose endless round of parties and people celebrating their success and renown cannot fill her deeply felt emptiness that prevents all attempts to connect, hope, or move on. Her inability to resolve the pain of this void has led her to attempt suicide several times, without success. So, unbeknown to the hitman, she's put this hit on herself.When LaPaglia comes to do the job, Rogers is in the midst of old friends, throwing a big party. Only she knows it's a going away party. She reveals that to him and her role as client and target, then proposes that they take a last ride around the city. His surprise at the contrary situation and her relief at soon dying, invite for both the first possibility of interest, in a very long time.Each also finds the other attractively attuned in thought, views on life, and conduct. Their yearning for  salvation in each other kindles so deftly and naturally that you wish desperately for a reprieve, Here are knowing portrayals of that classy, real tough kind of heartbreak. Despite a sunrise deadline on this revealing interlude from ceaseless desolation for two souls lost to the dark, the chemistry between LaPaglia and Rogers makes their recognition so right, so magnetic, so moving that you hope nevertheless. You really hope their newly found accord can save them, even though the death she's bought cannot be stopped.That's why their fates remain fixed, although they've changed each other. So, Rogers expresses no will for reprieve, and LaPaglia, none for deviation from his duty. Their driver is relieved to arrive just in time at the warehouse where the most important death for either one will claim one as sacrifice. If you wait for the credits to finish, you'll see how it claims the other, even in  life.I can understand why this film never found its audience. Although a great romance, it's no romcom. Although tough as adamantine, there's no goodfella here. Although a classic tragedy, it's not Masterpiece Theatre. It's just a forgotten movie that stuns me every time with its insight, acting, and pathos and makes me wish that Anthony LaPaglia and Mimi Rogers had gotten more good roles.What I can't understand is why Amazon would allow such a lazy, crass comment for its editorial review.",4,A haunting film that's hard to find,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,2790,"['unforgettable', 'tragedy', 'mob', 'killer', 'stab', 'love', 'glossy', 'gritty', 'glimpse', 'redemption', 'only', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'know', 'cruel', 'cost', 'not', 'too', 'great', 'bear.Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'hardcore', 'hitman', 'true', 'code', 'remorse', 'cold', 'heart', 'bulletproof', 'allowing', 'attachments', 'desire', 'regret', 'Feeling', 'nothing', 'professional', 'necessity', 'grown', 'strong', 'empty', 'world', 'deep', 'abyss', 'contract', 'tonight', 'glittering', 'socialite.Mimi', 'Rogers', 'glamorous', 'woman', 'endless', 'round', 'parties', 'people', 'celebrating', 'success', 'renown', 'can', 'not', 'fill', 'deeply', 'felt', 'emptiness', 'attempts', 'connect', 'hope', 'move', 'inability', 'resolve', 'pain', 'void', 'led', 'attempt', 'suicide', 'several', 'times', 'success', 'So', 'unbeknown', 'hitman', 'put', 'hit', 'herself.When', 'LaPaglia', 'do', 'job', 'Rogers', 'midst', 'old', 'friends', 'throwing', 'big', 'party', 'Only', 'going', 'away', 'party', 'role', 'client', 'target', 'then', 'take', 'last', 'ride', 'city', 'surprise', 'contrary', 'situation', 'relief', 'soon', 'dying', 'invite', 'first', 'possibility', 'interest', 'very', 'long', 'time.Each', 'also', 'other', 'attractively', 'attuned', 'thought', 'views', 'life', 'conduct', 'yearning', 'salvation', 'other', 'kindles', 'so', 'deftly', 'naturally', 'wish', 'desperately', 'reprieve', 'Here', 'are', 'knowing', 'portrayals', 'classy', 'real', 'tough', 'kind', 'heartbreak', 'sunrise', 'deadline', 'revealing', 'interlude', 'ceaseless', 'desolation', 'two', 'souls', 'lost', 'dark', 'chemistry', 'LaPaglia', 'Rogers', 'recognition', 'so', 'right', 'so', 'magnetic', 'so', 'moving', 'hope', 'nevertheless', 'really', 'hope', 'newly', 'found', 'accord', 'can', 'save', 'even', 'death', 'bought', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'stopped.That', 'why', 'fates', 'remain', 'fixed', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'other', 'So', 'Rogers', 'will', 'reprieve', 'LaPaglia', 'none', 'deviation', 'duty', 'driver', 'relieved', 'arrive', 'just', 'time', 'warehouse', 'where', 'most', 'important', 'death', 'one', 'will', 'claim', 'one', 'sacrifice', 'wait', 'credits', 'finish', ""'ll"", 'see', 'how', 'other', 'even', 'life.I', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'never', 'found', 'audience', 'great', 'romance', 'romcom', 'tough', 'adamantine', 'goodfella', 'here', 'classic', 'tragedy', 'not', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'just', 'forgotten', 'movie', 'time', 'insight', 'acting', 'pathos', 'wish', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'had', 'gotten', 'more', 'good', 'roles.What', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Amazon', 'would', 'allow', 'such', 'lazy', 'crass', 'comment', 'editorial', 'review']",Bulletproof Heart aka Killer  VHS
