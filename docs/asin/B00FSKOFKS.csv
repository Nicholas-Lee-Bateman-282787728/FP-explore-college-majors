1673363,A1NJ1J61AWVXMJ,B00FSKOFKS,C Mc,"[0, 0]","I love Castle's literary take on the usual crime drama. The clever references throughout to art, literature, and history make it stand out from the rest. Plus the acting and storylines themselves are fascinating. The characters have such strong personalities, yet are not static - they truly evolve from one season to another. It's fun to see how Castle and Kate are changed by their interactions with each other. They go from an antagonistic pair who struggle to work together to true teammates, softening each other's edges and bringing out the best in each other.

1673366,ABBYRILOMF5YN,B00FSKOFKS,"Istariel ""Istariel""","[20, 21]","Getting the boxed set at this price, and still factory sealed, was a great way to add all past seasons of the show to the collection, and get this wonderful series for keeps!  All that needs to be done now is to simply add Season 6 when it is released.  This is one of THE best shows to come out of the last twenty years of television that isn't a stupid survivor-type show (there are too many....), a purely-drama cop show, or a show devoted to either some crass (and possibly rich and spoiled) family (like the ridiculousness of the Kardashians or the Honey Boo Boo idiots), or stuff that shouldn't be on prime time at all because the line of gore has been stepped over (such as Walking Dead).If you like none of those types of shows and want pure entertainment, Castle is just plain fun -- gripping and suspenseful like any cop-show such as CSI, but full of occasionally smart yet sexy moments that really don't preclude someone of younger age watching it; good humor; life-reflecting moments; and good story lines such as the old shows like &#34;Murder She Wrote&#34; or others of the best shows out of the 1970s-1980s -- as it should be with its &#34;godfather&#34; being Stephen J. Cannell!Yet it contains nothing that would disgust or turn someone off with bad imagery of blood and guts or gratuitously visual sex steam.  It's smartly filmed by some of the best in the business -- Jonathan Frakes (of Star Trek fame), for instance, is a regular director on the series.  And of course, if one is a Firefly fan, this show is a MUST to be able to see more of the wonderfully talented (and yes, handsome) but funny Nathan Fillion's work!  He heads up an incredibly talented cast, and that is just as important as writing and crewing.Get this series...it will be well worth your while to do so, as there are many hours of enjoyment in it!",5,Best way to catch up!,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,1840,"['Getting', 'boxed', 'set', 'price', 'still', 'factory', 'sealed', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'add', 'past', 'seasons', 'show', 'collection', 'get', 'wonderful', 'series', 'keeps', 'be', 'done', 'now', 'simply', 'add', 'Season', '6', 'when', 'released', 'one', 'THE', 'best', 'shows', 'come', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'television', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'survivor-type', 'show', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'purely-drama', 'cop', 'show', 'show', 'devoted', 'crass', 'possibly', 'rich', 'spoiled', 'family', 'ridiculousness', 'Kardashians', 'Honey', 'Boo', 'Boo', 'idiots', 'stuff', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'prime', 'time', 'line', 'gore', 'been', 'stepped', 'such', 'Walking', 'Dead', '.If', 'none', 'types', 'shows', 'want', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'Castle', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'gripping', 'suspenseful', 'cop-show', 'such', 'CSI', 'full', 'occasionally', 'smart', 'yet', 'sexy', 'moments', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'preclude', 'someone', 'younger', 'age', 'watching', 'good', 'humor', 'life-reflecting', 'moments', 'good', 'story', 'lines', 'such', 'old', 'shows', '34', 'Murder', 'Wrote', '34', 'others', 'best', '1970s-1980s', 'should', 'be', '34', '34', 'being', 'Stephen', 'J.', 'Cannell', 'nothing', 'would', 'disgust', 'turn', 'someone', 'bad', 'imagery', 'blood', 'guts', 'gratuitously', 'visual', 'sex', 'steam', 'smartly', 'filmed', 'best', 'business', 'Jonathan', 'Frakes', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fame', 'instance', 'regular', 'director', 'series', 'course', 'one', 'Firefly', 'fan', 'show', 'MUST', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'more', 'wonderfully', 'talented', 'yes', 'handsome', 'funny', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'work', 'up', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'cast', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'writing', 'crewing.Get', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'while', 'do', 'so', 'are', 'many', 'hours', 'enjoyment']",Castle: Season 1-5 (2013)

The cast chemistry is interesting, the approach to the storyline is entertainig and different; the cliche's are common and silly and make me laugh. I started watching Castle on cable and started to wonder how this series began - so I purchased the five seasons.  I watched the entire first season in a few hours and loved it!  A famous writer who is read by just about every important person in city government and Castle's connections to them becomes hillarious. I enjoy the fact that Fillion's character is a single dad raising his daughter and their relationship is superb.  The actress who plays his daughter is intelligent as well as wise which is delightful and funny and her character meshes so well with her dad's.  Castle's mom, who reminds me of an Auntie Mame type, is flambouyant and funny and adds just the right femfatale touch.  Each character contributes to unblocking Castle's writing.The fact that he shadows a female police detective as she deals with homicides and sometimes gets in her way makes for a tour de force that's edgy and entertaining.",5,If you like a good story,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,1086,"['love', 'series', 'cast', 'chemistry', 'interesting', 'approach', 'storyline', 'entertainig', 'different', 'cliche', 'are', 'common', 'silly', 'make', 'started', 'watching', 'Castle', 'cable', 'started', 'wonder', 'how', 'series', 'began', 'so', 'purchased', 'five', 'seasons', 'watched', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'few', 'hours', 'loved', 'famous', 'writer', 'who', 'read', 'just', 'important', 'person', 'city', 'government', 'Castle', 'connections', 'becomes', 'hillarious', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'Fillion', 'character', 'single', 'dad', 'raising', 'daughter', 'relationship', 'superb', 'actress', 'who', 'daughter', 'intelligent', 'as', 'well', 'wise', 'delightful', 'funny', 'character', 'meshes', 'so', 'well', 'dad', 'Castle', 'mom', 'who', 'Auntie', 'Mame', 'type', 'flambouyant', 'funny', 'just', 'right', 'femfatale', 'touch', 'character', 'unblocking', 'Castle', 'writing.The', 'fact', 'female', 'police', 'detective', 'homicides', 'sometimes', 'way', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'edgy', 'entertaining']",Castle: Season 1-5 (2013)
