718895,A8MVGWI5ZKNQ5,B00006JU6I,Daisy Brambletoes,"[0, 0]","I love ""The yeomen of the Guard"".  I was really disappointed with this version.  I did like the idea of moving the scene from the reign of Henry VIII up to the restoration era, because it made much more sense of the storyline of war, heroism, and the Guard made up of veterans.  This would have fit very well in the post English Civil War period, far more than in Henry's time.  This detail was not lost on the ""new"" D'Oyly Carte's production when they were performing.Most of the casting was good, except for Pheobe, who needed a little more of the naughty-girl in her, and the dreadful miscasting of Joel Grey as Jack Point.There were jesters during the Restoration, though they were a fading tradition soon to disappear, and so it is safe to assume that our Jack Point was one more unempolyed jester who had tried to form his own little theatrical troupe.  Nice touch, and one that worked well.  But Joel Grey himself simply wasn't right for Jack Point.  He could have been, but he wasn't.  He also was rather uninterestingly dressed for a jester or even for a street player.  His costume might be worn and patched before Cholmundley hires him, but he would have still looked like a proper jester - who was a priviledged person of sorts, and whose costumes were made by tailors, and in many places it was a punishable offence for ordinary folk to dress as jesters.Jack Point is admittedly a man who is basically humorless, with an acerbic attitude, and he really has himself to blame for frightening off Elsie with his infamous snarl of ""Oh woe is you?  Your anguish sink!  Oh woe is me, I rather think!  Yes, woe is me, I rather think!"", but at the same time he is a man of intelligence and wit, and Joel Grey gives off not a shred of any of these qualities, good or bad.  He just weeps all the time, then dies.  It just doesn't work.",2,Jester wishes he was dead!,1184112000,"07 11, 2007",2007,1838,"['love', 'yeomen', 'Guard', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'version', 'did', 'idea', 'moving', 'scene', 'reign', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'up', 'restoration', 'era', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'sense', 'storyline', 'war', 'heroism', 'Guard', 'made', 'veterans', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'very', 'well', 'post', 'English', 'Civil', 'War', 'period', 'far', 'more', 'Henry', 'time', 'detail', 'was', 'not', 'lost', 'new', ""D'Oyly"", 'Carte', 'production', 'when', 'were', 'performing.Most', 'casting', 'was', 'good', 'Pheobe', 'who', 'needed', 'little', 'more', 'naughty-girl', 'dreadful', 'miscasting', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'Jack', 'Point.There', 'were', 'jesters', 'Restoration', 'were', 'fading', 'tradition', 'soon', 'disappear', 'safe', 'assume', 'Jack', 'Point', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'unempolyed', 'jester', 'who', 'had', 'tried', 'form', 'own', 'little', 'theatrical', 'troupe', 'Nice', 'touch', 'one', 'worked', 'well', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'Jack', 'Point', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'was', ""n't"", 'also', 'was', 'rather', 'uninterestingly', 'dressed', 'jester', 'even', 'street', 'player', 'costume', 'might', 'be', 'worn', 'patched', 'Cholmundley', 'would', 'have', 'still', 'looked', 'proper', 'jester', 'who', 'was', 'priviledged', 'person', 'sorts', 'costumes', 'were', 'made', 'tailors', 'many', 'places', 'was', 'punishable', 'offence', 'ordinary', 'folk', 'dress', 'jesters.Jack', 'Point', 'admittedly', 'man', 'who', 'basically', 'humorless', 'acerbic', 'attitude', 'really', 'blame', 'frightening', 'off', 'Elsie', 'infamous', 'snarl', 'Oh', 'woe', 'anguish', 'sink', 'Oh', 'woe', 'rather', 'think', 'Yes', 'woe', 'rather', 'think', 'same', 'time', 'man', 'intelligence', 'wit', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'not', 'shred', 'qualities', 'good', 'bad', 'just', 'weeps', 'time', 'then', 'just', ""n't"", 'work']",N/A
718896,A3VLAZEPO9UJEA,B00006JU6I,L. E. Cantrell,"[6, 6]","I am in general agreement with five of the preceding six Amazon reviewers.  This is ultimately a disappointing version of Gilbert and Sullivan's ""Yeomen of the Guard.""  It is all the more disappointing because its weaknesses arise from business decisions rather than artistic ones.  These Brent Walker productions were rigidly locked into two-hour blocks of television broadcast time.  Some, like ""The Pirates of Penzance"" and ""HMS Pinafore"" had to be stretched unconscionably.  This one had to be cut with a very dull and bloody ax.Save for one, the performers are very good.  Alfred Marks, as Wilfred Shadbolt, the Tower of London's Head Jailer and Assistant Tormentor, has a particularly commanding presence.  (My English wife, however, regards the accent he affects as rather improbable.)The weak link among the performers is the most famous of the bunch, Joel Grey.  Perhaps owing to the ridiculously short rehearsal schedule, Grey is dull where he should be sharp, annoying where he should be engaging and a flat-out failure in portraying the one tragic character in all of Gilbert and Sullivan.  Too bad.The London Symphony Orchestra and the Ambrosian Chorus both sound fine.  The conducting by Andrew Faris is quite satisfactory.Some regard ""Yeomen"" as the most operatic of the G&S; works.  It is certainly unique in being first and foremost a romance--and a fairly dark-hued one at that--rather than a comedy.  My wife, who appeared in two separate productions of ""Yeomen"" reserves that title of ""most operatic"" to G&S;'s ""Princess Ida"" and on a fair day when the wind is north by northwest, I agree with her.TEXT:  Large sections of spoken dialogue are omitted but the cuts in the musical texts are a far greater loss.  The following songs and ensembles are missing from this performance:Act I--""When maiden loves, she sits and sighs,"" first verse of solo for Phoebe Meryll""Alas, I waver to and fro!"" trio, Phoebe Meryll, Leonard Meryll, Sergeant Meryll""Is life a boon?"" solo, Colonel FairfaxAct II--""Free from his fetters grim--"" solo, Colonel Fairfax""Strange adventure, Maiden wedded,"" quartet, Colonel Fairfax, Sergeant Meryll, Dame Carruthers and Kate""When a wooer / Goes a-wooing,"" quartet, Elsie Maynard, Jack Point, Colonel Fairfax, Phoebe Meryll""Rapture, rapture,"" duet, Dame Carruthers, Sergeant MeryllIt may be noted that both solos and much else has been jettisoned from the part of the ostensible romantic tenor lead, Colonel Fairfax.  All the music for both Kate and Leonard Meryll is gone. (This latter I find particularly galling, since Leonard Meryll was my role with San Francisco's Lamplighters--forty years ago.)By my rough calculation, about nineteen minutes of music, including some of the best stuff in the show, are lost forever.LIBRETTO: The booklet that accompanies this set neglects to point out that its text is much less than complete--an understandable enough omission, I suppose.  W.S. Gilbert's stage directions have been abandoned wherever they have been ignored by the televison director and in some cases new directions have been inserted--again, understandable.Not understandable at all, however, is why some ham-handed compositor has played fast and loose with Gilbert's verse structures.  Where WSG in his carefully overseen printed editions has ""Here's a man of jollity, / Jibe, joke, jollify! / Give us of your quality, / Come, fool, follify!"", this libretto has ""Here's a man of jollity, jibe, joke, jollify! / Give us of your quality, come, fool, follify!""  This sort of slovenliness appears all through the printed text.PRODUCTION: Overall, the production is quite handsome, even sumptuous.  Tower Green is a fairly accurate reproduction of the Tower of London's  Green as currently preserved.  The interior of Sergeant Meryll's house is clearly based on the house of the Dutch painter Vermeer.  The quarters of the Yeomen seems to spring out of any of several 17th Century Dutch genre paintings.  With one exception, the costumes are good, although they are not those of Gilbert's specifically intended reign of Henry VIII (say 1540), but rather those of the time of Charles I (say 1630).The exception is the costume of Jack Point.  The man is a professional jester, for heaven's sake; he should not be the drabbest person on stage!  W.S. Gilbert was a famous illustrator of his own published works.  He clearly showed Jack Point dressed as though ready to pose for a portrait of the Joker in a new deck of cards.The decision to bring the play forward by three generations is a bit puzzling.  A down-at-the-heels jester on the road in the mid-16th Century is plausible.  Shakespeare's one-time lead comedian and partner, Will Kempe, toured the length of England in the 1590s, performing comic dances.  By the 1630s, though, the success of the established professional theater companies and the outright hostility of the Puritans would long-since have closed out the careers of any would-be wandering players.Three stars for this ""Yeomen of the Guard's"" not-inconsiderable merits, but is should have been so MUCH better!",3,"Oh, the doing and undoing ... / When a jester goes a-wooing / And he wishes he was dead!",1158883200,"09 22, 2006",2006,5072,"['am', 'general', 'agreement', 'five', 'preceding', 'six', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'ultimately', 'disappointing', 'version', 'Gilbert',

Elizabeth Gale as Elsie Maynard and Elizabeth Bainbridge as Dame Carruthers are both superb. They capture the parts to perfection, both in singing and acting. Geoffrey Chard as Sergeant Meryll, Peter Savidge as the Lieutenant, and Alfred Marks as Wilfred Shadbolt are also excellent. But I've given this version only 4 stars because there are some definite problems with it. Joel Grey is good, but somehow his rendition of Jack Point just doesn't quite work. The part of Phoebe is a good example of how *not* to do it - fake accent, very poor acting, and excessively operatic singing. The introduction by Douglas Fairbanks reaches an apex of inanity, but it's easy to skip it. More importantly, several songs and some parts of the dialog are cut. I don't know how anyone with a heart, or with any feeling for G&S, could have cut 'Is life a boon?' from the Yeomen of the Guard. The words are even engraved on Gilbert's tombstone.

I was also much impressed by the Wilfred Shadbolt, and by two mutes added, to good effect, in Point's and Maynard's traveling troupe. But all the performances are excellent, and well cast.

There are several numbers missing from the middle of both acts.  Act two in particular has a very abrupt and truncated feel.  Joel Grey is a fine musical comedy performer, but he is out of his league in this more operatic work.
