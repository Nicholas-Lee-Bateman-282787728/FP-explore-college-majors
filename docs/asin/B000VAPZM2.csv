Ashley, Zac, Vanessa, Corbin and Lucas, spare me you has-beens. Zac and Vanessa are one of the hottest couples I've ever seen in my entire life but that still doesn't mean that they don't participate in the creation of fodder-filled products!I hate how these celebrities make money from these brainless adults and the no-talent-loving children who support this corporately-kiddy pappy pap. I don't understand how these teens (besides Zac (20?) and Ashley, who's she's freaking 22 already!) just perform other people's crappy tunes. Ugh.I am SO tired of them all. Corbin writes about Homework (*LOL*) and Vanessa coos her way through R&B-wannabe; Pop tart music. And did you HEAR her sing that terrible song when she broke up with Zac and was on a bridge or something?? It made my ears wince in pain. She's a crappy singer, and I don't know who she had to make out with to get a record deal but she really, REALLY needs to step up her game and at least co-write 2 or 3 songs to get an ounce of my respect.I HATE all of you (minus Zac) and wish you would go away.The sooner the very better!Acting: DCover Art: B+ (the only thing decent about the movie whatsoever)Story: D+ (clich&eacute;-ridden)Characters: C- (LOL)Length: D- (110 minutes too long)Overall: D-2/5 or2 stars.",2,No one in this movie has talent.,1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,1361,"['was', 'never', 'funny', 'are', 'music', 'Me', 'was', 'WACK', 'dialogue', 'bored', 'tears', 'Ashley', 'Zac', 'Vanessa', 'Corbin', 'Lucas', 'spare', 'has-beens', 'Zac', 'Vanessa', 'are', 'one', 'hottest', 'couples', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'entire', 'life', 'still', ""n't"", 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'participate', 'creation', 'fodder-filled', 'products', 'hate', 'how', 'celebrities', 'make', 'money', 'brainless', 'adults', 'no-talent-loving', 'children', 'who', 'support', 'corporately-kiddy', 'pappy', 'pap', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'teens', 'Zac', '20', 'Ashley', 'who', 'freaking', '22', 'already', 'just', 'perform', 'other', 'people', 'crappy', 'tunes', 'Ugh.I', 'am', 'SO', 'tired', 'Corbin', 'Homework', '*LOL*', 'Vanessa', 'coos', 'way', 'R', 'B-wannabe', 'Pop', 'tart', 'music', 'did', 'HEAR', 'sing', 'terrible', 'song', 'when', 'broke', 'up', 'Zac', 'was', 'bridge', 'something', 'made', 'ears', 'wince', 'pain', 'crappy', 'singer', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'had', 'make', 'out', 'get', 'record', 'deal', 'really', 'REALLY', 'step', 'up', 'game', 'least', 'co-write', '2', '3', 'songs', 'get', 'ounce', 'respect.I', 'HATE', 'Zac', 'wish', 'would', 'go', 'away.The', 'sooner', 'very', 'better', 'Acting', 'DCover', 'Art', 'B+', 'only', 'thing', 'decent', 'movie', 'whatsoever', 'Story', 'D+', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Characters', 'C-', 'LOL', 'Length', 'D-', '110', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'Overall', 'D-2/5', 'or2', 'stars']",High School Musical 2

Director/choreographer Kenny Ortega really goes to town with HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 2, the sequel to the surprise smash-hit Disney Channel movie, set during the gang's summer vacation.When Troy (Zac Efron), Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) and their friends all land summer jobs at the ritzy Lava Springs resort owned by Sharpay and Ryan's parents, they simply can't believe their luck - and there's even going to be an end-of-summer talent competition!  But when Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) starts manipulating Troy for her own amusement, will he choose a college scholarship over Gabriella and his friends?The plot is as predictable as the first movie, but these ""High School Musical"" films need to be enjoyed on another level entirely.  Kenny Ortega has furnished the movie with tonnes of electric dance routines and the cast gives their absolute all.

Everyone knows that Disney's gonna milk this for all its worth as long as uncultured kids and their parents (cause they're the ones with the money) will buy into it. So what can I say that I haven't already said about the first? Well this superfluous sequel is obviously a rehash of the first only set at the end of the school year and at a country club. There's just too much similarity between the basketball song and dance of the first and the baseball song and dance of this one. And like someone else said, when were dance and baseball the same? I don't care if Gene Kelly incorporated sports moves in his choreography, in the big scheme of things, they don't mix (and for not being able to dance, the ""ethnic"" jock sure can dance [if that's what you want to call it]). And now that I've moved on to the songs; well, what can I say but UTTER RUBISH! Again they are uncatchy and really make no sense in the sequence of things other than to shoehorn in another (badly performed) song and (poorly choreographed) dance. The big brassy opener is a poor attempt to ""get back in"" to the picture. The one performed by the rich girl and her brother could've been explained in actual dialogue. And the spontaneity of when they actually do sing seems robotic. Did any of these ""actors"" have the balls (dance numbers aside) to perform live? The overacting (and the horrible choreography) on Efron's part during his, I guess you would call it a lament (when he dances idoitically around the golf course), makes it seem like he's a raving lunatic (and people said Meryl Streep overacted and looked ridiculous when she was singing The Winner Takes It All). And while I'm on the Mamma Mia! note; Pierce Brosnan couldn't sing? Are you joking? Has anybody heard these tone deaf peons? The only reason they sound good is through the magic of editing. If you watch the making of features of Mamma Mia and see some of Brosnan's recordings, he actually does sound as he does on the film/soundtrack. People may not think I'm being fair because I like Brosnan, Streep and Mamma Mia altogether but I know good acting and singing when I see it and HSM (1, 2 or3) definately, not in a million years or til the end of days, is it. At least when he sang, he did it with emotion. And I'm gonna stop there for the songs because they're the sung the same and over acted. Again, character development would be welcome but the two main leads stay the same (they break up about mid-way but get back together anyway), the white jock's sidekick remains the same and the mean girl remains, well, mean, rude and obnoxious (except at the end to sing the big finale number but only to return to her nasty ways in the third film). And the acting! This just has Oscar worthy written all over it! Every time Efron looks he's mad or is supposed to emote any feeling for that matter, he looks like he's about to break down and cry (even after ""yelling"" at his best friend). And let's not forget the un-memorable cameo by Miley ""gonna ruin three time Grammy award-winning group Radiohead because they didn't wanna meet me"" Cyrus by the pool. It's a shame that this is the same company that gave us ""Dumbo"" (Walt's favorite, might I add), ""Sleeping Beauty"" and so many other countless classics. Disney would be ashamed of what his dream has become! I know he definately would've kicked the one girl out after those pictures ""leaked"" onto the Internet (same thing goes for Cyrus). He wouldn't have them ruining the image that he worked so hard to achieve (I know there was that business with Annette Funicello being in a bikini but she had moved on from the corporation by then).",1,The Disney Empire Strikes Back (What'd We Ever Do To You To Deserve This Crap),1236902400,"03 13, 2009",2009,3700,"['WHAT', 'AGAIN', 'YOU', 'MEAN', 'THERE', 'SEQUEL', 'Well', 'course', 'Everyone', 'Disney', 'gon', 'milk', 'worth', 'as', 'long', 'uncultured', 'kids', 'parents', 'cause', ""'re"", 'ones', 'money', 'will', 'buy', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'said', 'first', 'Well', 'superfluous', 'sequel', 'obviously', 'rehash', 'first', 'only', 'set', 'end', 'school', 'year', 'country', 'club', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'similarity', 'basketball', 'song', 'dance', 'first', 'baseball', 'song', 'dance', 'one', 'someone', 'else', 'said', 'when', 'were', 'dance', 'baseball', 'same', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'incorporated', 'sports', 'moves', 'choreography', 'big', 'scheme', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'mix', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'dance', 'ethnic', 'jock', 'sure', 'can', 'dance', '[', 'what', 'want', 'call', ']', 'now', ""'ve"", 'moved', 'songs', 'well', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'UTTER', 'RUBISH', 'Again', 'are', 'uncatchy', 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'sequence', 'things', 'other', 'shoehorn', 'badly', 'performed', 'song', 'poorly', 'choreographed', 'dance', 'big', 'brassy', 'opener', 'poor', 'attempt', 'get', 'back', 'picture', 'one', 'performed', 'rich', 'girl', 'brother', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'explained', 'actual', 'dialogue', 'spontaneity', 'when', 'actually', 'do', 'sing', 'robotic', 'Did', 'actors', 'have', 'balls', 'dance', 'numbers', 'aside', 'perform', 'live', 'overacting', 'horrible', 'choreography', 'Efron', 'part', 'guess', 'would', 'call', 'lament', 'when', 'idoitically', 'golf', 'course', 'seem', 'raving', 'lunatic', 'people', 'said', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'overacted', 'looked', 'ridiculous', 'when', 'was', 'singing', 'Winner', 'Takes', 'All', ""'m"", 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'note', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'could', ""n't"", 'sing', 'Are', 'joking', 'Has', 'anybody', 'heard', 'tone', 'deaf', 'peons', 'only', 'reason', 'sound', 'good', 'magic', 'editing', 'watch', 'making', 'features', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'see', 'Brosnan', 'recordings', 'actually', 'sound', 'film/soundtrack', 'People', 'may', 'not', 'think', ""'m"", 'being', 'fair', 'like', 'Brosnan', 'Streep', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'altogether', 'know', 'good', 'acting', 'singing', 'when', 'see', 'HSM', '1', '2', 'or3', 'definately', 'not', 'million', 'years', 'til', 'end', 'days', 'least', 'when', 'sang', 'did', 'emotion', ""'m"", 'gon', 'stop', 'songs', ""'re"", 'sung', 'same', 'acted', 'Again', 'character', 'development', 'would', 'be', 'welcome', 'two', 'main', 'leads', 'stay', 'same', 'break', 'up', 'mid-way', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'anyway', 'white', 'jock', 'sidekick', 'same', 'mean', 'girl', 'well', 'mean', 'rude', 'obnoxious', 'end', 'sing', 'big', 'finale', 'number', 'only', 'return', 'nasty', 'ways', 'third', 'film', 'acting', 'just', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'written', 'Every', 'time', 'Efron', 'mad', 'supposed', 'emote', 'feeling', 'matter', 'break', 'down', 'cry', 'even', 'yelling', 'best', 'friend', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'un-memorable', 'cameo', 'Miley', 'gon', 'ruin', 'three', 'time', 'Grammy', 'award-winning', 'group', 'Radiohead', 'did', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'meet', 'Cyrus', 'pool', 'shame', 'same', 'company', 'gave', 'Dumbo', 'Walt', 'favorite', 'might', 'add', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'countless', 'classics', 'Disney', 'would', 'be', 'ashamed', 'what', 'dream', 'become', 'know', 'definately', 'would', ""'ve"", 'kicked', 'one', 'girl', 'pictures', 'leaked', 'Internet', 'same', 'thing', 'Cyrus', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'ruining', 'image', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'achieve', 'know', 'there', 'was', 'business', 'Annette', 'Funicello', 'being', 'bikini', 'had', 'moved', 'corporation', 'then']",High School Musical 2
1100029,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B000VAPZM2,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[19, 23]","I was amazed by the amount of extras on this 2-Disc DVD set. What a fantastic set--with over 5 hours of bonus material. The story is typically light-hearted fun as you would expect from this franchise. It's the last day of school, and all your favorite East High Wildcats are counting down the seconds for the final bell that tells them it's finally summer! The rousing opening song is ""What Time Is It?"" and gets the movie off to a high energy start. Troy (Zac Efron), Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens), and the gang must get summer jobs; meanwhile, Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) wants to get Troy a job at her country club, Lava Springs, so that he can sing with her at the talent show and become her new boyfriend. Unbeknownst to her, the club's manager, Mr. Fulton (Mark L. Taylor), has to hire the entire gang to get Troy...including Troy's girlfriend Gabriella. Sharpay does everything she can to break the two up, including setting Zac up with a sweet college scholarship. Can Zac resist?Visually, this movie is a technicolor feast that harks back to the Esther Williams/Busby Berkeley musicals of MGM. One of the most spectacular numbers if ""Fabulous,"" sung by Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) as she lets everyone at the pool know that she has impossibly high standards. Her brother, played by Lucas Grabeel, is dolled up like Elton John and plays a pink piano in the shallow end of the pool while wearing a white tux with hot pink lapels. Definitely classic!Spec-wise, the DVD audio is a speaker blowing Dolby Digital 5.1 mix and the video is full-frame. Sure, for those with 16x9 or widescreen TVs it's a disappointment. However, this movie was originally shown on the Disney Channel, and as you can clearly see in the behind-the-scenes documentaries (as you look over the shoulder of the camera and see the framing), this movie was COMPOSED for full-screen, even though there was spillover frame to fill out a widescreen. Minor quibbling point...still a great piece of entertainment suitable for ALL ages.Now onto the extras...there's a ton! You get a great sneak-peak at High School Musical 3 (which will actually debut in theaters), which shows that the whole gang is back, along with three newcomers (looks like Sharpay may have some competition in the conniving department from the new girl).

It certainly did not hurt the success of the Disney Channel premiere of High School Musical 2 did not include the song ""Humuhumunukunukua'pua'a,"" and it made the DVD premiere all the more exciting for the millions of fans who have made this one of the biggest  pop culture  icons of our era.The song, by the way, is surely an affectionate nod in a way to Annette Funicello, whose top 10 hit, ""Pineapple Princess"" is referenced in the lyrics. The whole infectious silliness is very much in the fun style of the early Disney pop tunes.And the movie is very much in the spirit of the bubbly 60's Beach Party movies that starred Annette and Frankie Avalon, though High School Musical has more budget and less innuendo. One could even draw a direct parallel between the poolside finale and Annette's poolside number in the film, Pajama Party.To its credit, the High School Musical sequel is true to its original style and does not give into what was surely a temptation to cash in on the success with endless cross promotion (""Hey everybody! Look who's just dropped in! It's TV's Regis Philbin!"") There are very subtle cameos by Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers strictly for eagle-eyed fans and that's about it.The bloopers are especially ingratiating, showing the cast off to its most endearing advantage. It looks like everyone's having a ball making the movie, though it's also very hard work as other special features prove (i.e. Zac Efron taken through take after take on his ""Bet on It"" number.No tween home will likely be without one of these DVDs.

The scene features Sharpay playing a pineapple princess looking for her ""fresh fish prince"" in the Polynesian fantasy  ""Humuhumunukunukua'pua'a."" The bonus features will be identical to the standard DVD: a sing-along feature, rehearsal footage and music videos.As for the film itself, this sequel to""High School Musical""features the same stars and nearly the same plot. Once again, high school hunk Troy (Zac Efron) ponders whether he should stick to the stuff he knows (in this case, the sweet Gabriella), the conniving Sharpay wants him there beside her, and eventually everyone learns that they're all in this together. If you loved the first movie you'd like this one -- it has the same feel-good bounce -- but I bet you won't be watching it as often.So why four stars? The music. It's better, and sounds fantastic in this Blu-ray release. ""You Are The Music In Me"" is a catchy duet by Gabriella and Troy (Vanessa Hudgens and Zac Efron) that uses a gospel chorus to rise above nearly everything cranked out by today's dime-a-dozen pop tarts. ""Everyday"" (also Gabriella and Troy) is in the same vein, an early-Britney bouncer with a finale straight out of a black church. ""I Don't Dance"" boogies along like an old big-band number with choreography inspired fromWest Side Story, while the staccato boy-band rocker ""Bet On It"" (Troy) recalls the best of Michael Jackson. Finally, ""All for One"" is a hand-clapping, surf-guitar shout-out that hints, a little, at Sheryl Crow's ""Soak in the Sun.""",4,"Widescreen, with killer sound",1188000000,"08 25, 2007",2007,1771,"['Blu-Ray', 'version', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', '2', 'widescreen', '1.78:1', 'presentation', 'TV-movie', '5.1', '48', 'kHz', '24-bit', 'uncompressed', 'audio.Like', 'standard', 'DVD', 'additional', 'music', 'scene', 'been', 'integrated', 'film', 'musical', 'number', 'Troy', 'Sharpay', 'rehearse', 'scene', 'Sharpay', 'playing', 'pineapple', 'princess', 'looking', 'fresh', 'fish', 'prince', 'Polynesian', 'fantasy', ""Humuhumunukunukua'pua"", 'bonus', 'features', 'will', 'be', 'identical', 'standard', 'DVD', 'sing-along', 'feature', 'rehearsal', 'footage', 'music', 'videos.As', 'film', 'sequel', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'same', 'stars', 'nearly', 'same', 'plot', 'Once', 'again', 'high', 'school', 'hunk', 'Troy', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'should', 'stick', 'stuff', 'case', 'sweet', 'Gabriella', 'conniving', 'Sharpay', 'eventually', 'everyone', ""'re"", 'together', 'loved', 'first', 'movie', ""'d"", 'like', 'one', 'same', 'feel-good', 'bounce', 'bet', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'often.So', 'why', 'four', 'stars', 'music', 'better', 'fantastic', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'Are', 'Music', 'Me', 'catchy', 'duet', 'Gabriella', 'Troy', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'gospel', 'chorus', 'rise', 'nearly', 'everything', 'cranked', 'out', 'today', 'dime-a-dozen', 'pop', 'tarts', 'Everyday', 'also', 'Gabriella', 'Troy', 'same', 'vein', 'early-Britney', 'bouncer', 'finale', 'straight', 'black', 'church', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Dance', 'boogies', 'old', 'big-band', 'number', 'choreography', 'inspired', 'fromWest', 'Side', 'Story', 'staccato', 'boy-band', 'rocker', 'Bet', 'Troy', 'best', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Finally', 'One', 'hand-clapping', 'surf-guitar', 'shout-out', 'hints', 'little', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'Soak', 'Sun']",High School Musical 2

I have the soundtrack and I listen and sing it every day so far. My favorite song from the movie is Bet On It. My other favorites in this order are I Don't Dance,Everyday,Gotta Go My Own Way,You Are The Music in Me,Work This Out, and What Time is It! I think everybody all ages will love this movie no matter how old they are.I think it is a great movie for kids in high school they can see how they can deal with people that get in there way and they can see how to deal with realtionsihps.I think it shows how to deal with problems in real life in any school but, really for like kids in middle school to high school that is what type of people are in the audience. I say it is for all ages babies, kids, tweens, teens, and adults. It is about Troy Bolton (Zac Effron) and Gaabreilla (Vansesa Hudgens) get split apart by Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) again and Ryan (Luvas Crabel) becomes more independent about himself. In the end everybody in the movie are friends at the end of it.  I really defitenly recommend  that you see the movie when it comes out on DVD. I think you will enjoy it very much. I know you will because I enjoyed it alot. I also bought the soundtrack the day it came out. I will also buy it on DVD the day it comes out on December 11, 2007.

Futrell,"[3, 5]","I have read some reviews which said that some of the movie doesn't make sense (ex-Troy being a team player in the first movie but not in the second) but in all reality it does because high school doesn't always make sense. You try to fit in when and where you can. It's a part of trying to find yourself which is what I think Troy was trying to do.As far as the movie goes it was a really good movie. The gang is out for summer and they are all looking for a summer job. Troy gets a call from a Golf club and resort and he accepts the offer and gets the rest of the gang in too. However he is unaware that Sharpay & Ryans parents own the club and Sharpay is only trying to get with Troy. Troy goes through a lot of mishaps trying to find himself and he only gets himself into a lot of trouble. As usual Sharpay is only looking out for herself and is only interested in Troy. Sharpay and Troy hang out a lot during the movie because it is all in Sharpays plan to win over Troy. Just know in the end it doesn't work. Troy hurts and makes a lot of people mad in this movie. You defintely see a different side of everyone in this movie. Expect the unexpected because I think you will be very surprised at some parts of this movie. Welcome to high school where everything gets complicated.The songs in the movie however, are amazing. I like that there a lot of ballads and duets between Troy and Gabriella. The songs between those two are so powerful and meaningful in this movie. Again they were amazing. There are also quite a bit of songs with the entire group minus the Evans. There are quite a bit of upbeat songs and some slow songs which give a great variety once again.The only thing I did not like about this movie is how Troy treated Gabriella.

As usual, one wonders if they saw the same film.  This movie was made to appeal to pre-teen and teen viewers and it's been a hit with them this summer.  I'm not a teen, but I've always loved teen movies and I found it terrific.  I've had lots of kids say positive things to me about this movie and so I know it was well received.  I'm just so glad that musicals are popular again as I've always liked that genre.  Music has a way of touching people in ways that a regular film just can't.  Yes, this film has been marketed, but I have to say that to market successfully you have to have a good product (which this is).Ok, we all knew that the movie producers would have a really hard time matching the success of the first movie which was a real classic.  This movie came so close to being even better than the first.  I think what did this was the outstanding music, vocal performances of Zac & Vanessa, and choreography.  Also, the ""romantic quotient"" is quite high and there are plenty of romantic scenes for those of us who like those kind of movies. Zac and Vanessa have a lot of onscreen chemistry & their real love for each other really shines through on film. I can see that there are a few scenes that are going to get 'stuck' in my dvd player! :) Also, the message is very good about staying true to yourself and making the most of opportunities while you are young.  If you go off the track, it means nothing and you can lose sight of what's really important and become someone you don't want to be.  There are more positive messages as well, and I think that's one of the things that is so great about these movies.Extended version?  This makes me happy because it seems to mean extra features and perhaps deleted scenes.  Yipee!  It should be great.  December 11th can't come soon enough.  Also, the idea of a 3rd movie about their prom in theatres is exciting to me.

I didn't exactly love it, but I definitely liked it a lot.  What I didn't really like was how much Troy/Gabriella (Troyella) scenes there were.  We all know that the're a couple.  That was made clear at the end of the first movie.  I thought that Sharpay was over the top at times...I liked the way she was in the first one a bit more.All right...now for what I liked about this movie.  I loved the fact that Lucas Grabeel (Ryan) had a storyline in this one.  He did not have enough screen time in the last one; he was basically just following Sharpay around the whole time so seeing him 'break free' (pardon the pun) from Sharpay was great.  I really liked seeing Corbin Bleu (Chad) and Monique Coleman (Taylor) more in this movie.  They actually had solos in this one!  I also liked the fact that they both danced a lot more.  The rest of the supporting cast had much bigger roles as well which I really enjoyed.This movie was also more dramatic than the first.  While some of it was definitely silly, it was also fun.  The dance numbers were the best in my opinion...especially What Time Is It, I Don't Dance and All For One.All in all, this is a good movie for kids, tweens, teens, or anyone that likes Disney...and HSM of course. :)  I recommend it to anyone who saw the first one and loved it.

1100053,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000VAPZM2,Mark Baker,"[3, 4]","Its summer vacation and the Wildcats (otherwise known as East High students) are counting down the seconds until they are free.  Of course, most of them are hoping to find summer jobs and so far having no luck.All that changes when Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) gets offered a job at Lava Springs, the local country club.  He quickly gets jobs for all his friends, including his girlfriend Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Anne Hudgens).There's one thing they hadn't counted on, however.  Lava Springs is owned by the parents of Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) and Ryan (Lucas Grabeel).  Sharpay had arranged for Troy to get a job so she could steel him away from Gabriella.  So, naturally, she is furious to see the whole gang show up.Even more important to her is the talent show.  After losing out in the winter musical at school, she wants to retain her crown in the talent show.  And the presence of her rivals just might upset that.So Sharpay sets out to destroy her classmates by separating Troy from everyone else.  And as more great things happen to him, he begins to grow distant.  Will he remember what is truly important?  Who will win the talent show?  And will Troy ever kiss Gabriella?I'll admit, as much as I loved the first, I didn't like this one right away.  But I watched it a second time and enjoyed it more.This movie falls into the same trap many sequels do, the retread.  Many of the plot points feel like they were lifted from the first movie.  Now I know that movie wasn't original, but I would have preferred to see the characters make different mistakes this go around.  Additionally, the climax felt rushed, like something was cut to make everything make sense.  I liked it, but it just wasn't logical enough for me.I loved so many of the background characters.  While they are all back, they get pushed even more into the background.  Frankly, I would have liked to see more of them.The soundtrack this time gets a heavy pop push, with most of the songs sounding like polished pop tracks.  That makes it even more obvious that the actors are lip synching by the time they filmed the musical numbers.  In fact, some of the songs come across more as music videos then songs in a musical.  I'm sure the tween intended audience won't mind, but it did bug me.Okay, if the movie has all these flaws, why am I giving it 4 stars?  Because, once again, the movie is fun.While the songs are overproduced for a musical, they are still good songs.  They're fun to sing along with, and the dance numbers are great.  I especially enjoyed ""I Don't Dance.""Set during the summer before the character's senior year, some of the characters are struggling with their future.

I had no interest, whatsoever, to see High School Musical.  The Disney channel and its movies used to be filled with magic and beauty.  Over the years, Disney has really lost its flair for the magic that once was.  My youger brother told me about High School Musical and I told him to piss off!  But then just before I had to go off to work, he pops in the dvd and makes me watch the first 15 minutes.  I was hooked!  Seeing these two kids singing for the first time, falling in love right before my eyes left me smiling all day.  I wanted to see what would happen next.  I eventually saw the entire movie and loved every minute of it.  Its message of acceptance in High School and the pressures of fitting in I thought were very relevant.  The remembrance of first loves, school spirit, friends were all a part of the High School Musical experience.  Yes, the cheesiness of the dialouge gave little chance for most of the actors to turn in mind blowing performances.  But given the material, the cast succeeded with flying colors.  The magic of Disney was back.  And the world was also aware of this because, what would follow would be one of the most inticipated sequels in Disney history, High School Musical 2.  I am not ashamed to say that I rushed to the television to watch the sequel, in all its majesty.  I am not suprised to say that the sequel was made on a grander scale but lost alot of that magic that made the first so special. Yes, it had more songs, more dancing, and more cheesiness.  The truth of the matter is that the creators of High School Musical 2 made the same mistake that most sequels make.  They thought that more is better when that is obviously not the case.  The magic of Troy and Gabriella was replaced with, ""When are they gonna kiss?""  But that is not to say that High School Musical 2 doesnt have its moments. There is the idea that there is alot of pressure on teens about what to do after high school, finding the money for college.While there are fewer songs in this movie that are good, the ones that are, rival the quality of the first High School Musical film.  Two of my personal favorites were ""Gotta Go My Own Way"" and ""Bet On It"".  Its not a great movie and its nowhere near as good as the first, but i did enjoy it for what it effort and I would reccomend it to HSM fans.  But then again, HSM fans dont need me to convince them!  Looking forward to the theatrical release of High School Musical 3!  yay!  See you in the theater!",3,Great songs.

1100067,A24L13Q1GJAS6U,B000VAPZM2,"The Cruelly Mad Emperor Caligula ""Little Boots""","[6, 28]","Parents: on the surface, HSM 2 impersonates a virtuous, family-friendly vehicle which spares your children from unhealthy influences and suggestions (promiscuous/premarital/swinging sex, drugs, gangs, alcohol, violence), but after fair and balanced analysis, it ONLY LOOKS that way. Beneath its surface of bubble-gum ""innocence"" and triviality lies a hotbed of SIN (both mortal, venial) that the malevolent liberals who monopolize the entertainment world are hiding from you in plain sight, but still selling to your kids. No fear, however!!!! I've done all the grueling, analytical work, in place of lazy and careless parents who don't give a damn, to outline precisely all the SINS in HSM 2 so you parents can shield your kids from this hostile influence.Under the fiendish guise of  promoting to teens activities that are healthy and the opposite of the destructive influences usually peddled on teens from our liberal media and pop culture, HSM 2 endorses dancing!!!! It's not just dancing...it's the even more effeminate mischief of Broadway-style musical numbers and the uncontrollable urge to break out in show tunes at horridly timed places all over the movie. Because of this severely emasculating element, HSM 2 runs the risk of potentially turning some formerly male, teen viewers into you-know-whats.Mark my words: HSM 2 and movies like it are really a clandestine, feminist plan to emasculate what little ""maleness"" our modern society still has left!!!! For goodness sake, if you don't know, Zac Efron (Troy) even unabashedly wears makeup in real life--just look at his bizarre, coifed appearance at premieres. Intellectually honest people will readily admit that America in the 21st century is already on its way to being turned into a limp-wristed society due to all the women who ""whip"" their men. Well, HSM 2 takes that feminist ideology and targets it to impressionable, male teens. Where male teens ought to have their masculinity encouraged by developing their leadership, athleticism and self-reliance, HSM 2 schemes to take this away from them, especially with all the Zac Efron singing and dancing.A misdirected fantasy among some parents is HSM 2 encourages kids to develop their talents and ""be themselves"" (even if that ""self"" is rather effeminate!). However, look more analytically and you'll find HSM 2 actually promotes nothing but materialism and superficial attractiveness which are bane for a society, because one should ideally judge people by their character, not how they look or how great their clothes are.As such, HSM 2 is a catastrophic, ethical abuser in that its young ""stars"" are marketed in the roles of their characters as perfectly groomed; into the latest, trendy fashions; and more attractive than you'll find in run-of-the-mill high schools all over the US (trust me, I check out teens in high schools always). The Corbin Blue and Efron characters dress like little, perfect models straight out of the Abercrombie and Finch catalogues (oops, my bad: Corbin Blue would be excluded since he's not white!)!!!! The worst offending characters as it concerns proselytizing kids with messages about materialism are Sharpay and Ryan. They snidely prance around in their Juicy Couture and Ralph Loren Polo, respectively, which makes kids of lesser socio-economic backgrounds feel worthless. Hasn't Disney yet learned that they should shield teens from the harsh reality of unequal income backgrounds and instead feed them unrealistic propaganda to make sure their feelings are spared??!!Perhaps, just perhaps...the most affronting contravention is the shocking amount of F-L-E-S-H that HSM 2's nubile and supple, teen actors expose and brandish as they skimpily bound around the screen in mock perkiness, which sees their corresponding body parts bouncing along. For an allegedly wholesome movie, HSM 2 showcases many young, coming-of-age girls who wear bathing suits and sleeveless/strapless outfits!!!! Parents, it gets much worse as some of these same, nubile girls who are hopefully still virgins in real life show cleavage--and this movie's targeted to tweens!!!! WTF?!?!Yet another area of discomfort relates to Troy and Gabriella's rebelliousness throughout the film! Is Disney plotting to glorify teen disobedience of rules and authority, or what? I'm talking about Troy and Gabriella breaking country club rules by going skinny dipping in the pool at night, though they well know staff members are prohibited from such mischief! I'm also talking about the same, two characters picnicking on the golf course when they know trouble awaits them if discovered!!!!In closing, I just must express my distaste at the real-life, personal turmoil that one of the most horrid examples to young kids and people in general exhibits. I'm, clearly, pointing my righteous finger at Vanessa Hudgens who earlier this year was divulged as a sexual miscreant for salaciously posing nude in pictures which got leaked onto the internet!!!! Parents, this is the vulgar fetishist whom you are allowing to ""entertain"" your kids!!!!

It seemed to hold together, but I was very disappointed in the music. The songs were okay, but my problem was all the extra stuff they added to them.In the first one if there was a solo, it was actually a solo, like when Vanessa was singing in the hallway, but in this one when Zac was singing on the golf course there was backup singers. There should not be backup singing when you are obviously standing by yourself in the middle of a golf course. Also there seeming to be a lot of computerized stuff added into all the songs which I hated. the first one was the cast using there voices to make the songs. this one you couldn't even hear them most of the time over all the other stuff.I do not recommend this one if you want the music to be as good as the first one.

1100071,AP3B615GM191G,B000VAPZM2,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","Though most film sequels fail to live up to the originality of their predecessor, High School Musical 2 is the rare film able to actually eclipse its first effort.This time, the plot sees the East High crew all land jobs at a fancy country club (owned by Sharpay Evans' rich father).  While trying to manage work and summer funtime activities, Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) sees his relationship with Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens) fray to perhaps the breaking point, while of course Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) seems to be the schemer behind everything.Another simple plot, to be sure, but what really establishes this film as a notch above the first one is the much more imaginative song and dance numbers.  ""I Don't Dance"", featuring the entertaining talents of Corbin Bleu and Lucas Grabeel, will strike a chord with sports fans, while both numbers featuring Tisdale's Sharpay (""Humu Humu"" and the upbeat ""You Are The Music In Me"") will leave you feeling as if you are at a Broadway or Branson stage show production.Though hesitant to subordinate any of HSM 2's cast members, as they all bring something different to the table, I think that Tisdale possesses the most raw singing/dancing/acting talent, and thus a prolonged focus on her character does this film good.  Her songs are always the most show-stopping of any HSM movie, and her completely over-the-top portrayal of Sharpay is a riot!So never fear fans of the original HSM...this second effort will keep you singing and dancing long after the TV is turned off.  Plus, though I highly recommend viewing the first film, newcomers to the series do not need to see ""part one"" in order to fully appreciate ""part two"".",5,Even Better Songs/Dances Push This Film Past Its Predecessor,1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,1671,"['most', 'film', 'sequels', 'fail', 'live', 'up', 'originality', 'predecessor', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', '2', 'rare', 'film', 'able', 'actually', 'eclipse', 'first', 'effort.This', 'time', 'plot', 'East', 'High', 'crew', 'land', 'jobs', 'fancy', 'country', 'club', 'owned', 'Sharpay', 'Evans', 'rich', 'father', 'trying', 'manage', 'work', 'summer', 'funtime', 'activities', 'Troy', 'Bolton', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'relationship', 'Gabriella', 'Montez', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'fray', 'perhaps', 'breaking', 'point', 'course', 'Sharpay', 'Ashley', 'Tisdale', 'be', 'schemer', 'everything.Another', 'simple', 'plot', 'be', 'sure', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'notch', 'first', 'one', 'much', 'more', 'imaginative', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Dance', 'featuring', 'entertaining', 'talents', 'Corbin', 'Bleu', 'Lucas', 'Grabeel', 'will', 'strike', 'chord', 'sports', 'fans', 'numbers', 'featuring', 'Tisdale', 'Sharpay', 'Humu', 'Humu', 'upbeat', 'Are', 'Music', 'Me', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'are', 'Broadway', 'Branson', 'stage', 'show', 'production.Though', 'hesitant', 'subordinate', 'HSM', '2', 'cast', 'members', 'bring', 'something', 'different', 'table', 'think', 'Tisdale', 'most', 'raw', 'singing/dancing/acting', 'talent', 'thus', 'prolonged', 'focus', 'character', 'film', 'good', 'songs', 'are', 'always', 'most', 'show-stopping', 'HSM', 'movie', 'completely', 'over-the-top', 'portrayal', 'Sharpay', 'riot', 'So', 'never', 'fear', 'fans', 'original', 'HSM', 'second', 'effort', 'will', 'keep', 'singing', 'dancing', 'long', 'TV', 'turned', 'off', 'highly', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'first', 'film', 'newcomers', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'see', 'part', 'one', 'order', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'part', 'two']",High School Musical 2
