489917,A2AJKZ7GCQEQKR,B0000039D0,Mishelly,"[0, 0]","I remember being addicted to all the Danielle Steel movies 20 years ago, so I was so excited when I received the box set of Danielle Steel movies recently.  Message from Nam was one of the first ones I watched because it was always my favourite.  How can anyone not love the journey Paxton Andrews takes over a eleven year period.It's a long movie, but definitely worth the effort, and because of the length it makes it feel like eleven years do pass, and by the end of the movie I felt like I lived Paxton's life with her.  The actress who plays Paxton is truly remarkable in her role.  At the beginning she is this innocent wide-eyed 18 year old who has so much passion and excitement for the future.  As the years go by, and she faces endless tragedy during the Vietnam War, she becomes tougher and slightly jaded towards life and love.  You almost feel her ageing as the movie goes on, even though I guess her age to be about 30 by the time the movie ends.I don't want to give too much away for the people who haven't seen this movie, but be warned, this movies shows the harsh realities of war, and what the people of Vietnam went through, as well as the soldiers who went over there to fight.  I found all the characters to be engaging, and wanted them all to find happiness.  My favourite character was Tony.  He was so cold and distant at the beginning, but as his feelings for Paxton grew, he became this beautiful, passionate caring man.  I loved his first encounter with Paxton when he said to her, ""Are we recruiting high school girls to fight the war now?""  And later in the movie when Paxton told him men fighting a war shouldn't have their heads filled with other things because it could get them killed, to which Tony replied he hoped she was wrong because his head had been filled up with thoughts of her for eight months.  Sigh.  Who couldn't love a man who speaks like that.Through out this movie you will find yourself crying, smiling and caring about these people as they all strive to find happiness during such a terrible time in history.  This movie teaches you to not give up on love, no matter how many times your heart breaks, because life is worth living if you have someone travelling along the same road as you.  In other words, watch this movie.  It's a sweeping epic that will stay with you long after you watch it :-)",5,"Beautiful, Epic Story",1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,2350,"['remember', 'being', 'addicted', 'Danielle', 'Steel', 'movies', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'when', 'received', 'box', 'set', 'Danielle', 'Steel', 'movies', 'recently', 'Message', 'Nam', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'ones', 'watched', 'was', 'always', 'favourite', 'How', 'can', 'anyone', 'not', 'love', 'journey', 'Paxton', 'Andrews', 'eleven', 'year', 'period.It', 'long', 'movie', 'definitely', 'effort', 'length', 'feel', 'eleven', 'years', 'do', 'pass', 'end', 'movie', 'felt', 'lived', 'Paxton', 'life', 'actress', 'who', 'Paxton', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'role', 'beginning', 'innocent', 'wide-eyed', '18', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'passion', 'excitement', 'future', 'years', 'go', 'endless', 'tragedy', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'tougher', 'slightly', 'jaded', 'towards', 'life', 'love', 'almost', 'feel', 'ageing', 'movie', 'even', 'guess', 'age', 'be', '30', 'time', 'movie', 'ends.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'be', 'warned', 'movies', 'harsh', 'realities', 'war', 'what', 'people', 'Vietnam', 'went', 'through', 'as', 'well', 'soldiers', 'who', 'went', 'there', 'fight', 'found', 'characters', 'be', 'engaging', 'wanted', 'find', 'happiness', 'favourite', 'character', 'was', 'Tony', 'was', 'so', 'cold', 'distant', 'beginning', 'feelings', 'Paxton', 'grew', 'became', 'beautiful', 'passionate', 'caring', 'man', 'loved', 'first', 'encounter', 'Paxton', 'when', 'said', 'Are', 'recruiting', 'high', 'school', 'girls', 'fight', 'war', 'now', 'later', 'movie', 'when', 'Paxton', 'told', 'men', 'fighting', 'war', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'heads', 'filled', 'other', 'things', 'could', 'get', 'killed', 'Tony', 'replied', 'hoped', 'was', 'wrong', 'head', 'had', 'been', 'filled', 'up', 'thoughts', 'eight', 'months', 'Sigh', 'Who', 'could', ""n't"", 'love', 'man', 'who', 'that.Through', 'movie', 'will', 'find', 'crying', 'smiling', 'caring', 'people', 'strive', 'find', 'happiness', 'terrible', 'time', 'history', 'movie', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'love', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'heart', 'breaks', 'life', 'worth', 'living', 'have', 'someone', 'travelling', 'same', 'road', 'other', 'words', 'watch', 'movie', 'sweeping', 'epic', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'watch']",Danielle Steel's Message From Nam VHS
