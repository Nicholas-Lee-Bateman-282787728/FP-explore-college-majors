1527180,A27QKI9K6RKFIT,B00772SM7C,"CARLOS ROMERO ""&#34;natural cinephile&#34;""","[4, 5]","In ""Gianni e le donne"" (""The Salt of Life"") from 2011 and directed by Gianni di Gregorio, we have a bittersweet tale in the life of an aging retiree who thinks he's lost his spark to attract the opposite sex. 'Gianni' (Gianni di Gregorio) is an easy-going and very mild-tempered 60 year-old who lives with his wife (whom he respects, but is obviously no longer intimate with), his daughter (she's always asking him for advise with her relationship), and her live-in boyfriend. And his elderly mother is constantly calling him to do one thing or another for her! He also has an attractive young neighbor whose life is an endless party and he heartily agrees to walk her Saint-Bernard. In short: 'Gianni' is a nice guy who helps everyone out but is somehow feeling empty. His friend 'Alfonso the lawyer' suggests he take a mistress, but 'Gianni' confesses that he's become transparent to women, or so he thinks. 'Gianni' is basically playing his real-life self and so is the rest of the cast: Valeria de Franciscis, Alfonso Santagata, Elisabetta Piccolomini, Valeria Cavalli, Aylin Prandi, Kristina Cepraga, Michelangelo Ciminale, Teresa di Gregorio, Grabiella Sborgi, etc., etc. The women were voluptuously beautiful and very nicely represented a cross-section of the Roman type. This is a great comedy that is looking at life in a very light and positive way. The title of the film in Italian really translates as: ""Gianni and the Women"". However, none of the women in the film are seduced or taken advantage of, by 'Gianni'. There is none of the male clich&eacute;s or motifs associated with earlier Italian films. It's also free of the cynicism and sarcasm of so many similarly related films too. I think what 'Gianni' is missing or has neglected to nurture, will soon see the light of day, by the inspiration the women really symbolize! An excellent bittersweet comedy that is more than it seems. Highly recommended, I loved it. The DVD picture and sound quality by Zeitgeist is excellent.

And he is perpetually at his mother's beck and call despite her having a full time caregiver. One of Gianni's friends brings to his attention some of the other older men who area carrying on affairs with younger women and begins encouraging him to pursue his own affair with a younger woman - any younger woman.Gianni  begins to notice attractive young women everywhere - almost as though surrounded by them (at one point, he is). These beauties, though, almost seem to live in a world where he is a ghost; observing them while he goes unnoticed. He also begins noting a separate world of old men, unconnected to a life with women and fears becoming one of them. He makes awkward attempts with a few of the attractive young women who are aware of him, tries to rekindle an old flame, and gets shanghaied to be ""wingman"" on an attempted double-pickup. Many of the women are unselfconsciously beautiful and charming. Others, simply capitalize on their good looks to encourage older men to spend money on them.The humor is mostly gentle, and often subtle, relying on lingering moments and tiny shifts of posture and gaze.""The Salt of Life"" reveals a bit of the difference between the life we have vs. the life we imagine we could have and how they are reconciled (or not).",4,The Salt of Life - Poured Into Aging Wounds,1329004800,"02 12, 2012",2012,1500,"['Forced', 'retire', '50', 'Gianni', 'unnecessary', 'wife', 'daughter', 'lives', 'obvious', 'affection', 'little', 'see', 'relationship', 'wife', 'comfortableness', 'long', 'companionship', 'perpetually', 'mother', 'beck', 'call', 'having', 'full', 'time', 'caregiver', 'One', 'Gianni', 'friends', 'attention', 'other', 'older', 'men', 'who', 'area', 'carrying', 'affairs', 'younger', 'women', 'begins', 'encouraging', 'pursue', 'own', 'affair', 'younger', 'woman', 'younger', 'woman.Gianni', 'notice', 'attractive', 'young', 'women', 'everywhere', 'almost', 'surrounded', 'one', 'point', 'beauties', 'though', 'almost', 'seem', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'ghost', 'observing', 'unnoticed', 'also', 'noting', 'separate', 'world', 'old', 'men', 'unconnected', 'life', 'women', 'fears', 'becoming', 'one', 'awkward', 'attempts', 'few', 'attractive', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'aware', 'tries', 'rekindle', 'old', 'flame', 'shanghaied', 'be', 'wingman', 'attempted', 'double-pickup', 'Many', 'women', 'are', 'unselfconsciously', 'beautiful', 'charming', 'Others', 'simply', 'capitalize', 'good', 'looks', 'encourage', 'older', 'men', 'spend', 'money', 'them.The', 'humor', 'mostly', 'gentle', 'often', 'subtle', 'relying', 'lingering', 'moments', 'tiny', 'shifts', 'posture', 'gaze', 'Salt', 'Life', 'bit', 'difference', 'life', 'have', 'vs.', 'life', 'imagine', 'could', 'have', 'how', 'are', 'reconciled', 'not']",The Salt of Life
1527183,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00772SM7C,Paul Allaer,"[4, 4]","You may recall that a few years back Gianni Di Gregorio scored an unexpected hit (big in EUrope, modest in the US) with his directorial debut ""Mid-August Lunch"", in which he is forced to entertain his 93 yr. old mother and her friends. The success of the movie encouraged De Gregario to now come back with this movie, which is not a sequel as such to ""Mid-August Lunch"", but it does feature a number of the same characters, including of course Gianni and his now 95 yr. old (fictional) mother.In ""The Salt of Life"" (original Italian title ""Gianni and the Ladies""; 2011 release from Italy; 90 min.), Gianni finds himself, at age 60 and being a pensioner, becoming invisible to the opposite sex, and his friend Alfonso is determined to help Gianni find romance again. Meanwhile Gianni must deal with his mom, who calls him frequently when she is sick (real or imagined) or needs help in some way. Gianni's wife and daugther (played by Gianni's real life daughter), along with her slacker boyfriend, are around as well, causing yet more headaches and problems for Gianni. There is no major ""plot"" to speak of, the beauty of the movie is to watch Gianni react to the situations around him, making observations about ageing and wanting to find new meaning (and romance) in life. There are a number of laugh-out-loud scenes in the movie, but the overall tone is more bittersweet than funny. Please note there are a couple of nice extras on the DVD, including a pleasant 20 min. ""Behind the Scenes"" documentary, giving glimpses in the complicated movie-making process, even for such a 'simple' film as this one, as well as an interview with lead actor/writer/director Di Gregorio.I couldn't help but think back to that other ""Italian"" movie from earlier this year, Woody Allen's ""To Rome With Love"", and how in retrospect so contrived that movie is compared to this one, which by all means brings a real slice of life, not some tourist postcard-like movie. I had seen the trailer for ""The Salt of Life"" a number of times here in Cincinnati when catching other movies, but for whatever reason the movie never did make it here. I didn't realize that the DVD had already come out so when I saw this earlier this week, I immediately snapped it up. So glad I did. If you are in the mood for a funny yet bittersweet top-notch quality foreign movie, ""The Salt of Life"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,4.5 stars... laugh-out-loud yet bittersweet,1352073600,"11 5, 2012",2012,2377,"['may', 'recall', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Gianni', 'Di', 'Gregorio', 'scored', 'unexpected', 'hit', 'big', 'EUrope', 'modest', 'US', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Mid-August', 'Lunch', 'forced', 'entertain', '93', 'yr.', 'old', 'mother', 'friends', 'success', 'movie', 'encouraged', 'De', 'Gregario', 'now', 'come', 'back', 'movie', 'not', 'sequel', 'such', 'Mid-August', 'Lunch', 'feature', 'number', 'same', 'characters', 'including', 'course', 'Gianni', 'now', '95', 'yr.', 'old', 'fictional', 'mother.In', 'Salt', 'Life', 'original', 'Italian', 'title', 'Gianni', 'Ladies', '2011', 'release', 'Italy', '90', 'min', 'Gianni', 'age', '60', 'being', 'pensioner', 'becoming', 'invisible', 'opposite', 'sex', 'friend', 'Alfonso', 'determined', 'help', 'Gianni', 'find', 'romance', 'again', 'Meanwhile', 'Gianni', 'must', 'deal', 'mom', 'who', 'frequently', 'when', 'sick', 'real', 'imagined', 'help', 'way', 'Gianni', 'wife', 'daugther', 'played', 'Gianni', 'real', 'life', 'daughter', 'slacker', 'boyfriend', 'are', 'around', 'as', 'well', 'causing', 'yet', 'more', 'headaches', 'problems', 'Gianni', 'major', 'plot', 'speak', 'beauty', 'movie', 'watch', 'Gianni', 'react', 'situations', 'making', 'observations', 'ageing', 'wanting', 'find', 'new', 'meaning', 'romance', 'life', 'are', 'number', 'laugh-out-loud', 'scenes', 'movie', 'overall', 'tone', 'more', 'bittersweet', 'funny', 'Please', 'note', 'are', 'couple', 'nice', 'extras', 'DVD', 'including', 'pleasant', '20', 'min', 'Scenes', 'documentary', 'giving', 'glimpses', 'complicated', 'movie-making', 'process', 'even', 'such', ""'simple"", 'film', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'interview', 'lead', 'actor/writer/director', 'Di', 'Gregorio.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'back', 'other', 'Italian', 'movie', 'earlier', 'year', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Rome', 'Love', 'how', 'retrospect', 'so', 'contrived', 'movie', 'compared', 'one', 'means', 'real', 'slice', 'life', 'not', 'tourist', 'postcard-like', 'movie', 'had', 'seen', 'trailer', 'Salt', 'Life', 'number', 'times', 'here', 'Cincinnati', 'when', 'catching', 'other', 'movies', 'reason', 'movie', 'never', 'did', 'make', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'DVD', 'had', 'already', 'come', 'out', 'when', 'saw', 'earlier', 'week', 'immediately', 'snapped', 'up', 'glad', 'did', 'are', 'mood', 'funny', 'yet', 'bittersweet', 'top-notch', 'quality', 'foreign', 'movie', 'Salt', 'Life', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",The Salt of Life
