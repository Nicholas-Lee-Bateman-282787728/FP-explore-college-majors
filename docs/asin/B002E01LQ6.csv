This movie is very slow.

This one fits the bill fairly well. It was originally a TV mini-series, so it is split into two 3-hour parts. The first part details how a meteor hits the moon and how it is discovered to be a fragment of a brown dwarf which implies certain dangers. The first part has some decent interaction between characters as well as evenly-spaced disaster scenes. Most of the action takes place in the US and Germany. The second half deals with attempts to devise a plan to deal with the impending disaster. It involves the required military attempt to go against scientists and blow things up which fails followed by a just-in-time heroic rescue by the scientists. The effects are passable, but obviously somewhat low-budget and in places, cheesy. The characters and their adventures are fairly standard for a movie like this with the usual suspects dying, the usual heroes saving the day and getting the girl and the usual bad guys having a change of heart. All in all, there isn't a whole lot new here other than perhaps a novel, albeit unrealistic disaster scenario. Still, the movie managed to keep my attention and keep me thinking.

This is actually a good thing if you want the drama and character development that is possible in a movie that is 3 hours and 10 minutes long.No plot spoilers from me; the movie centers on the events that occur immediately after what is believed to be an asteroid hits the moon (which happens very shortly after the movie starts), the effects it has on the earth, and the efforts of the governments and scientists of the world to set things right... before the world is destroyed.I am a Sci-Fi and disaster movie junkie, so I likely rated this higher than many movie purists would since there are a lot of scientific faults, implausible events, and has almost every clich&eacute; from just about every other disaster movie. The special effects ranged from laughable to outstanding, but the cinematography was actually very good. The acting was right on par for a TV movie and the characters well played and given time to develop.While all movies of this type require some suspension of disbelief, there were several things that bothered me more than the obvious technical and scientific flaws, and the biggest was the portrayal of the government and military leaders as obstructionist and paranoid to the point where they would risk the lives of every person on the planet.

It was virtually a one trick show with the ""weightlessness"" providing the only wow factor.  Unfortunately, they kept dragging it out every time the plot began to stall.  Literally, if you've seen it once, you've seen it a hundred times.There was a pall of half-heartedness over the entire production.  Whereas others in this genre go overboard by fabricating a heightened sense of urgency, Impact crawled along as if it had all the time in the world.  Someone had their finger on the snooze button and didn't let up.It started with a tentative non-debate of religion over data, data trumping everything (according to Natasha Henstridge's character).  From that point on it tiptoed its way through 190 minutes of: anomalies, geese flying in the wrong direction, compasses that wouldn't work, tides running amuck, the ever popular cell phone interference, the dead wife syndrome, the ex-husband from hell, and the world's worse grandfather.  Considering everything they tossed into the mix, there were more than enough sob stories to go around.  Unfortunately, none of them had much to do with the matter at hand.  Naturally, the military had their own agenda, as did political sycophants surrounding the President.  This too is typical of this genre.But the greatest hindrance to this bloated film/miniseries was the actor David James Elliott, playing Alex Kittner, the one with the bright idea to save the world.  I've never seen a more blas&eacute; performance, given the circumstances of impending DOOM.  Robotic, is the kindest description I could apply to his unreasonably dull appearance in a pivotal role.  His tone of voice, his lack of expression, all rarely changed throughout the course of this epic.  He was given the opportunity to display some type of emotion, twice, and both times he couldn't be bothered to summon up even a cursory example to fit the occasions.  For a second I thought he had something but no, it was just the way they lit him.  He posed more than he performed.  Even the children playing his offspring were more credible than he was.  It was as if he knew this wasn't going to amount to much so he didn't bother to try.I didn't hate it, it was okay.

Furthermore, science fiction is supposed to be based on scientific rigor with a license for logical and credible extrapolation. The scientific adviser for the miniseries must have been sleeping during the whole shooting because the list of violations of scientific laws and basic knowledge is endless.The following is a short list of the worst inaccuracies or impossibilities: (i) a full moon that is seen simultaneously in Earth's day side (U.S.) and in the night side (Europe); (ii) the moon looks bigger from Earth's surface than from space; (iii) electro-magnetism lifting non-metallic objects; (iv) assuming an anti-gravity effect was possible, cars and people floated but small objects did not; and (v) the lousy handling of the brown dwarf physical properties, which do not follow Newton's nor Keppler's laws.A small brown dwarf has a mass similar to Jupiter (Jupiter mass is around 320 times that of Earth) and a big one could be 80 times that, so in good faith let's assume that it was just an splinter that hit the Moon. So if this ""dwarf"" splinter has a mass two times that of Earth (consequently its mass will be 12 times that of the Moon) then: (i) any decent observatory would have detect it approaching because the gravity of such big mass would have affected the orbits of all planets in the Solar System; (ii) the Moon would have been completely smashed on impact and not just cracked; (iii) the Moon's orbit would have completely altered after impact, following more or less the brown dwarf original trajectory and no longer locked to the Earth; and (iv) the Earth's orbit would have been altered too, now becoming a satellite to the Moon + Brown Dwarf system.As for the special effects their quality is poor even by a TV series standard. SFXs look like late 70s technology: some of the astronaut scenes look like the TV episodes of the original Start Trek series and the low resolution the lunar surface is a shame, I wonder if was actually a painting.Definitively not recommended. And for the sci-fi fans I do recommend instead the novel,Moonfall, which has a similar Moon impact plot but more plausible (real hard science fiction).",1,"Another clever plot idea with a very clumsy development, and please, this is not science fiction!",1262304000,"01 1, 2010",2010,2370,"['one', 'more', 'case', 'clever', 'sci-fi', 'plot', 'idea', 'wasted', 'bad', 'development', 'dull', 'melodramatic', 'script', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'particularly', 'performance', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'lousy', 'Furthermore', 'science', 'fiction', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'scientific', 'rigor', 'license', 'logical', 'credible', 'extrapolation', 'scientific', 'adviser', 'miniseries', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'sleeping', 'whole', 'shooting', 'list', 'violations', 'scientific', 'laws', 'basic', 'knowledge', 'endless.The', 'following', 'short', 'list', 'worst', 'inaccuracies', 'impossibilities', 'i', 'full', 'moon', 'seen', 'simultaneously', 'Earth', 'day', 'side', 'U.S.', 'night', 'side', 'Europe', 'ii', 'moon', 'bigger', 'Earth', 'surface', 'space', 'iii', 'electro-magnetism', 'lifting', 'non-metallic', 'objects', 'iv', 'assuming', 'anti-gravity', 'effect', 'was', 'possible', 'cars', 'people', 'floated', 'small', 'objects', 'did', 'not', 'v', 'lousy', 'handling', 'brown', 'dwarf', 'physical', 'properties', 'do', 'not', 'follow', 'Newton', 'Keppler', 'laws.A', 'small', 'brown', 'dwarf', 'mass', 'similar', 'Jupiter', 'Jupiter', 'mass', 'around', '320', 'times', 'Earth', 'big', 'one', 'could', 'be', '80', 'times', 'so', 'good', 'faith', 'let', 'assume', 'was', 'just', 'splinter', 'hit', 'Moon', 'So', 'dwarf', 'splinter', 'mass', 'two', 'times', 'Earth', 'consequently', 'mass', 'will', 'be', '12', 'times', 'Moon', 'then', 'i', 'decent', 'observatory', 'would', 'have', 'detect', 'approaching', 'gravity', 'such', 'big', 'mass', 'would', 'have', 'affected', 'orbits', 'planets', 'Solar', 'System', 'ii', 'Moon', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'smashed', 'impact', 'not', 'just', 'cracked', 'iii', 'Moon', 'orbit', 'would', 'have', 'completely', 'altered', 'impact', 'following', 'more', 'less', 'brown', 'dwarf', 'original', 'trajectory', 'longer', 'locked', 'Earth', 'iv', 'Earth', 'orbit', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'altered', 'too', 'now', 'becoming', 'satellite', 'Moon', '+', 'Brown', 'Dwarf', 'system.As', 'special', 'effects', 'quality', 'poor', 'even', 'TV', 'series', 'standard', 'SFXs', 'look', 'late', '70s', 'technology', 'astronaut', 'scenes', 'look', 'TV', 'episodes', 'original', 'Start', 'Trek', 'series', 'low', 'resolution', 'lunar', 'surface', 'shame', 'wonder', 'was', 'actually', 'painting.Definitively', 'not', 'recommended', 'sci-fi', 'fans', 'do', 'recommend', 'instead', 'novel', 'Moonfall', 'similar', 'Moon', 'impact', 'plot', 'more', 'plausible', 'real', 'hard', 'science', 'fiction']",Impact

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","I'm not much of a science guy so I appreciate this mini-series' stab at explaining the tricky stuff in a way that even a layman like me can take in. It's too bad then that, according to my science nerd pals, the film dishes out quite a bit of astronomical hooey. IMPACT is a two-part television mini-series that aired on ABC in 2009. I guess it's a well-executed disaster flick if only you can temper your jonesing for scientific accuracy. For some, that's a big if.Astronomers are proclaiming it the greatest meteor shower in nearly ten thousand years. It's a momentous event being witnessed first-hand by star-gazers all across the globe (and you see the flaw in that statement, right?). In an observatory in New Mexico, scientist Maddie Rhodes (Natasha Henstridge) alarmingly observes an asteroid that had been hidden until now, of which diameter measures 19 kilometers, twice the size of the meteor that supposedly killed off the dinosaurs. To the star-gazers' disbelief, this asteroid blasts into the moon, throwing it out of orbit and into a collision course with *gulp* Earth.As the moon looms ever closer, we note the immediate repercussions: compasses thrown out of whack, cell phone disruptions, massive electrical discharges, temporary loss of gravity... An emergency think tank is assembled, comprised primarily of Maddie Rhodes, widower and former NASA astrophysicist Alex Kittner (David James Elliott), and German scientist and leading moon expert Roland Emerson (Benjamin Sadler).The team concludes that the asteroid that had slammed and then lodged a piece of itself into the moon is a fragment of a brown dwarf (a.k.a. a dead star). As such, that lodged piece bears a mass weighing twelve sextillion tons, rendering the moon suddenly twice as heavy as Earth. Professor Kittner gets on the whiteboard and explains why the moon's now assumed an elliptical orbit around Earth, at which point my science pals started cracking up. Apparently, something with enough force and energy to propel the moon out of orbit would obliterate or seriously damage the moon upon impact.""Do you think the man in the moon is okay?"" asks Kittner's earnest young daughter. She's part of the required soap opera that courses thru these disaster flicks. And, actually, the two young actors (Natasha Calis, Owen Best) playing the Kittner kids are engaging and don't get much in the way of the core narrative. James Cromwell has a choice supporting bit as Kittner's reclusive father-in-law. Colin Cunningham (from FALLING SKIES) is pretty good at playing dirt bags and it's the same-old, same-old here as his part calls for a shady, down-on-his-luck reporter intent on landing the scoop of a lifetime, no matter the fallout. Meanwhile, the fairly distracted moon expert may have to put his impending nuptials on hold. The apocalypse tends to screw up all sorts of plans. So, yeah, the human drama angle is well covered.Keeping in mind that this is a made-for-television affair, the special effects hold up okay. I do like the fantasy element of them cars and trains soaring weightless thru air. In the end run, I think IMPACT is pretty entertaining. I guess the eggheads'll have a field day channeling Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo and dissing the supposedly poor application of science. But give the mini-series some credit. At least when it was time to launch a team to space on a last ditch mission to avert the end of everything, there isn't an oil rigger in sight. 3.5 out of 5 stars for IMPACT, on the strength of the never-gets-old doomsday premise and a good cast and how the movie manages to be both cheesy AND massively entertaining and that I like watching David James Elliott do his acting thing.",4,"""Do you think the man in the moon is okay?""",1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,3696,"[""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'science', 'guy', 'appreciate', 'mini-series', 'stab', 'explaining', 'tricky', 'stuff', 'way', 'even', 'layman', 'can', 'take', 'too', 'bad', 'then', 'according', 'science', 'nerd', 'pals', 'film', 'out', 'quite', 'bit', 'astronomical', 'hooey', 'IMPACT', 'two-part', 'television', 'mini-series', 'aired', 'ABC', '2009', 'guess', 'well-executed', 'disaster', 'flick', 'only', 'can', 'temper', 'jonesing', 'scientific', 'accuracy', 'big', 'if.Astronomers', 'are', 'proclaiming', 'greatest', 'meteor', 'shower', 'nearly', 'ten', 'thousand', 'years', 'momentous', 'event', 'being', 'witnessed', 'first-hand', 'star-gazers', 'globe', 'see', 'flaw', 'statement', 'right', 'observatory', 'New', 'Mexico', 'scientist', 'Maddie', 'Rhodes', 'Natasha', 'Henstridge', 'alarmingly', 'asteroid', 'had', 'been', 'hidden', 'now', 'diameter', '19', 'kilometers', 'twice', 'size', 'meteor', 'supposedly', 'killed', 'off', 'dinosaurs', 'star-gazers', 'disbelief', 'asteroid', 'moon', 'throwing', 'orbit', 'collision', 'course', '*gulp*', 'Earth.As', 'moon', 'ever', 'closer', 'note', 'immediate', 'repercussions', 'compasses', 'thrown', 'whack', 'cell', 'phone', 'disruptions', 'massive', 'electrical', 'discharges', 'temporary', 'loss', 'gravity', 'emergency', 'think', 'tank', 'assembled', 'comprised', 'primarily', 'Maddie', 'Rhodes', 'widower', 'former', 'NASA', 'astrophysicist', 'Alex', 'Kittner', 'David', 'James', 'Elliott', 'German', 'scientist', 'leading', 'moon', 'expert', 'Roland', 'Emerson', 'Benjamin', 'Sadler', '.The', 'team', 'asteroid', 'had', 'slammed', 'then', 'lodged', 'piece', 'moon', 'fragment', 'brown', 'dwarf', 'a.k.a', 'dead', 'star', 'such', 'lodged', 'piece', 'mass', 'weighing', 'twelve', 'sextillion', 'tons', 'rendering', 'moon', 'suddenly', 'twice', 'as', 'heavy', 'Earth', 'Professor', 'Kittner', 'whiteboard', 'why', 'moon', 'now', 'elliptical', 'orbit', 'Earth', 'point', 'science', 'pals', 'started', 'cracking', 'up', 'Apparently', 'something', 'enough', 'force', 'energy', 'propel', 'moon', 'orbit', 'would', 'obliterate', 'seriously', 'damage', 'moon', 'impact', 'Do', 'think', 'man', 'moon', 'okay', 'Kittner', 'earnest', 'young', 'daughter', 'part', 'required', 'soap', 'opera', 'disaster', 'flicks', 'actually', 'two', 'young', 'actors', 'Natasha', 'Calis', 'Owen', 'Best', 'playing', 'Kittner', 'kids', 'are', 'engaging', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'way', 'core', 'narrative', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'choice', 'supporting', 'bit', 'Kittner', 'reclusive', 'father-in-law', 'Colin', 'Cunningham', 'FALLING', 'SKIES', 'pretty', 'good', 'playing', 'dirt', 'bags', 'same-old', 'same-old', 'here', 'part', 'shady', 'down-on-his-luck', 'reporter', 'intent', 'landing', 'scoop', 'lifetime', 'matter', 'fallout', 'Meanwhile', 'fairly', 'distracted', 'moon', 'expert', 'may', 'have', 'put', 'impending', 'nuptials', 'hold', 'apocalypse', 'screw', 'up', 'sorts', 'plans', 'So', 'yeah', 'human', 'drama', 'angle', 'well', 'covered.Keeping', 'mind', 'made-for-television', 'affair', 'special', 'effects', 'hold', 'up', 'okay', 'do', 'fantasy', 'element', 'cars', 'trains', 'soaring', 'weightless', 'thru', 'air', 'end', 'run', 'think', 'IMPACT', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'guess', 'eggheads', ""'ll"", 'have', 'field', 'day', 'channeling', 'Crow', 'T.', 'Robot', 'Tom', 'Servo', 'dissing', 'supposedly', 'poor', 'application', 'science', 'give', 'mini-series', 'credit', 'least', 'when', 'was', 'time', 'launch', 'team', 'space', 'last', 'ditch', 'mission', 'avert', 'end', 'everything', ""n't"", 'oil', 'rigger', 'sight', '3.5', '5', 'stars', 'IMPACT', 'strength', 'never-gets-old', 'doomsday', 'premise', 'good', 'cast', 'how', 'movie', 'be', 'cheesy', 'massively', 'entertaining', 'like', 'watching', 'David', 'James', 'Elliott', 'do', 'acting', 'thing']",Impact

Where did they get their idea -- what science fad are they using for this movie?  In this case they are targeting anti gravity science enthusiast, disaster movie lovers and, brown atar theorists and end of time buffs. Of course they add in religion to make things more interesting. The acting in this tear jerker was excellent, especially the Al Gore look alike president and all the other characters -- homeland security, pentagon representative, and loving kids. Women were of course the ones in the know and men typical idiots. The sets however were not well done -- typical of disaster movies.  What would actually happen if an asteroid of this magnitude hit the ocean would result in massive tidal waves which would by themselves wipe out all life on land. I had to wonder how anything electric could still function after being burned out by the electric storm. Even as a rebel scientist I could not figure out where they dug up this gravity theory.

ONLY in America--if you have an idea, someone else will ALWAYS beat you to it!!I hate it when ANY of the plot is revealed so my apologies to those who might consider this review too cryptic. I am a big movie buff and thought I knew most of these films; at least the ones worth watching. Boy, was I surprised to not only find my plot in a movie, but one that was good. It even hurts to admit that this movie has a better and more reasonable beginning and overall storyline. I'm sure it won't satisy the critics or the snobs [believe me, I know some and have even coached little league with them] at JPL and NASA who look down their considerale noses at us laymen who have the audacity to ask 'stupid' questions about our solar system.For the rest of us who go to the movies to be entertained and don't need to discuss Shakespeare at their next dinner party to feel superior, IMPACT was a lot of fun. It was not only interesting and obviously researched from, and in more time than it takes to thumb through your son's third-grade science textbook, it was exciting, and actually BELIEVABLE!! Most action or science-fiction movies resort to simplistic or ridiculous plot contrivances to get their characters out of--or into--difficult situations. They abuse artistic license or take lazy shortcuts that make deus ex machina seem like a math theorem.IMPACT was obviously written by someone of intelligence who, if he or she doesn't have a science background, had the integrity and drive to research this premise to a high degree--of satisfaction--for this film nut!!

The first part seemed to drag on. Very very slow.I did the Amazon Unbox for this movie, and the video quality of the first part wasn't so great. What irritated was that the video quality of the second part seemed SIGNIFICANTLY better than the first, and immediately. When I say immediately, I do mean the first few seconds of the second part. I think the second part might have been filmed with better/newer cameras than the first. The video quality of the second part stayed good until the end. Why would the video quality of the second part be so much better than the video quality of first part?The second part of the movie was just too fast - there seemed to be a lot that could have been added, not that it would have made the movie any better.I am not a scientist, but I do have a good education, yet I found the ""science"" behind this movie to be extremely flawed.I am of the opinion that the writers of the movie were more interested in developing the characters than the science. The characters were definitely closer to reality than the science, but that isn't saying much. The only character that came close to being ""real"" is the dude who drove the kids to see their dad. He came very close to abandoning them, yet decided to help them anyways. This character was the exception to the rule, as most people would have left the kids to fend for themselves.At three hours and ten minutes, this movie was painfully long. I have seen and watched movies of this length before, and found most of them entertaining. This movie was horrible. At the point when the ""first part"" of the movie was over, I really wasn't overly interested in watching the rest. However, I did anyways, thinking the movie might end strong. I was disappointed.The only reason I gave the movie two stars is because the UnBox version is significantly cheaper than buying the DVD. If you really do decide to watch this movie, UnBox it.
