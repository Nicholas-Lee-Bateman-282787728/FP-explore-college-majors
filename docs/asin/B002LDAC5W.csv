1276144,A2YE5FAB8BHR82,B002LDAC5W,"Davide Bianchini ""Rising Suns""","[22, 22]","I have heard stories of young women who watch this movie end up entering religious life. This should give you an idea of how powerful this movie can be, especially for those who may have a calling to a more contemplative order, such as the Carmelites.In addition, the movie seems to depict traditional Spanish Carmlelite spirituality quite well, including some rich Carmelite traditions that have been forgotten in many convents. It is clear the director/producers did their homework. And what is more, they were able to capture in some small way the heart of this saint--though no movie is ever able to capture it perfectly.Although the movie begins somewhat slow, and the production is not the best quality, do not let this deter you from seeing it through (it begins to pick up a lot in the second part of the series. The first part is just setting the stage as they say). I would also recommend, if you know anyone who might have a vocation to religious life, have them watch this. Movies should be able to impact people's lives, and this is one of the few that can.The only shortcoming in this movie, I feel, is that they only used a handful of quotes from her diary and letters. They should have incorporated more exerts from her writings, so that her love for God and souls could really shine forth. She was a more than just a sweet young girl who loved God. She was consumed by love. She did more than suffer and die gracefully. She suffered and died gracefully for the salvation of souls. The movie could have brought forth, more, this redemptive quality of suffering, which so imbues Carmelite spirituality.",4,Not watered down like many Catholic movies,1268697600,"03 16, 2010",2010,1617,"['have', 'heard', 'stories', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'watch', 'movie', 'end', 'up', 'entering', 'religious', 'life', 'should', 'give', 'idea', 'how', 'powerful', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'especially', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'calling', 'more', 'contemplative', 'order', 'such', 'Carmelites.In', 'addition', 'movie', 'depict', 'traditional', 'Spanish', 'Carmlelite', 'spirituality', 'quite', 'well', 'including', 'rich', 'Carmelite', 'traditions', 'have', 'been', 'forgotten', 'many', 'convents', 'clear', 'director/producers', 'did', 'homework', 'what', 'more', 'were', 'able', 'capture', 'small', 'way', 'heart', 'saint', 'movie', 'ever', 'able', 'capture', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'production', 'not', 'best', 'quality', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'deter', 'seeing', 'pick', 'up', 'lot', 'second', 'part', 'series', 'first', 'part', 'just', 'setting', 'stage', 'say', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'vocation', 'religious', 'life', 'have', 'watch', 'Movies', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'impact', 'people', 'lives', 'one', 'few', 'only', 'shortcoming', 'movie', 'feel', 'only', 'used', 'handful', 'quotes', 'diary', 'letters', 'should', 'have', 'incorporated', 'more', 'exerts', 'writings', 'love', 'God', 'souls', 'could', 'really', 'shine', 'forth', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'sweet', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'loved', 'God', 'was', 'consumed', 'love', 'did', 'more', 'suffer', 'die', 'gracefully', 'suffered', 'died', 'gracefully', 'salvation', 'souls', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'forth', 'more', 'redemptive', 'quality', 'suffering', 'so', 'Carmelite', 'spirituality']",N/A

The original Sr Teresa who in real life was Juanita Fernandes and died a teenage saint of 19 years and 9 months. It is good to read the book GOD THE JOY OF MY LIFE by Michael D Griffin (Ignatius Press) (which contains her DIARY) and also THE LETTERS OF ST TERESA OF THE ANDES.

It did start slow for me, but there is so much information in here and St. Teresa seems to have been different from many saints in that she was a regular person who just tried to follow God's will in her life.  That is what we are all called to do.  We are all called to be saints, but many of us just cannot give up our comforts and self love.  I recommend this movie to anyone discerning the religious life.

1276149,A22675MTMURLLD,B002LDAC5W,Rogue,"[2, 2]","This movie is in Spanish and was originally aired in her native land of Chile.  So the viewer would appreciate the historically accurate wardrobe and Spanish dialect.  The movie has each of the 3 DVDs with 2 or 3 sections in each DVD.  The sections look like they were part of an aired series.  The movie has English subtitles and was beautifully made.  I would think though that it may go a little slow so the viewer would have to have patience while watching it.  It is an accurate portrayal of the Saint and comes with a commentary by a Carmelite Father afterwards which is short but moving.  I am really interested in the writings of this Carmelite Saint which can be obtained in English by ICS Publications and in Spanish by the Monte Carmelo, editorial.
