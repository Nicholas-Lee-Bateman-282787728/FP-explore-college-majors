What a break! But, Ronnie's big break soon turns into a big disaster when he finds himself on the run being hunted by a group of killers. Can Ronnie stay one step ahead of the bad guys and save his precious skin? Oh yeah, and the girl's skin too?This is a fun old movie, combining Bob Hope with siren Dorothy Lamour on the one hand, and the likes of Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney Jr. on the other. It's pretty lightweight, but also pretty goofy and a lot of fun. If you like that oddball humor that Bob Hope did so well then you will like this movie.

197568,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,6300158489,Andrew McCaffrey,"[0, 0]","MY FAVORITE BRUNETTE (1947) is a funny send-up of the film noir genre that was so popular at the time.  Bob Hope's character works next door to the classic, hard-drinking, tough-talking detective that Raymond Chandler placed into all of his thrillers.  Of course, while the neighbor displays all the strong qualities needed by a man of action, Bob Hope himself is playing his usual bumbler -- tempted only by the life of excitement and convinced he has what it takes to be no-nonsense private eye because he can drink bourbon and owns his own gun.Ironically, the film's success comes by placing Bob Hope in settings and situations which were already clich&eacute;s by the time the film was made: mistaken identity, misplaced photograph negatives, damsels in distress, a lost map and an innocent man fighting to clear his name.  In fact, you could imagine this film with only slight changes being made as a slightly unimaginative straight drama.  The comedy comes from playing it very close to the sources and then launching into the mocking at just the right moment.  The dialog is quite good, too, with Bob Hope getting lots of tough talk to say, but never quite getting it out right.You'll notice Peter Lorre in the cast list, and he plays a knife-throwing, sleazy villain -- the type of role he usually portrayed in conventional noir films.  He plays it completely straight, which is why he never fails at provoking laughter.  He's one of the anchors for this film, providing the weight that allows the jokes to work.That said, this still isn't nearly the funniest parody I've ever seen.  Some sections of the movie drag.  More than a few jokes drop with a clang and many of them are far too predictable.  Lon Cheney Jr.'s character is a bit too stereotypical and stupid to be truly amusing.I own the Digiview release of this DVD, and the picture and sound are more than adequate.  I'm sure there are better versions of this movie available for purchase, but given how cheap you can find this edition, I'd be hard pressed to pass it up.You can find this DVD available for virtually no money at all, and I think the single dollar I splurged on it was a buck well spent.  I'm not the biggest fan of Bob Hope (in fact, I think this is the only film I've seen him in that I actually liked), but he's entertaining for these short eighty-eight minutes.  If you like film noir and don't mind a few digs at the genre, take a chance on this.  It's not as if you'll be risking a huge amount of money.",3,Not my favorite movie... but good enough,1121040000,"07 11, 2005",2005,2493,"['FAVORITE', 'BRUNETTE', '1947', 'funny', 'send-up', 'film', 'noir', 'genre', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'time', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'character', 'next', 'door', 'classic', 'hard-drinking', 'tough-talking', 'detective', 'Raymond', 'Chandler', 'placed', 'thrillers', 'course', 'neighbor', 'strong', 'qualities', 'needed', 'man', 'action', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'playing', 'usual', 'bumbler', 'tempted', 'only', 'life', 'excitement', 'convinced', 'what', 'be', 'no-nonsense', 'private', 'eye', 'can', 'drink', 'bourbon', 'own', 'gun.Ironically', 'film', 'success', 'placing', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'settings', 'situations', 'were', 'already', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'misplaced', 'photograph', 'negatives', 'damsels', 'distress', 'lost', 'map', 'innocent', 'man', 'fighting', 'clear', 'name', 'fact', 'could', 'imagine', 'film', 'only', 'slight', 'changes', 'being', 'made', 'slightly', 'unimaginative', 'straight', 'drama', 'comedy', 'playing', 'very', 'close', 'sources', 'then', 'launching', 'mocking', 'just', 'right', 'moment', 'dialog', 'quite', 'good', 'too', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'getting', 'lots', 'tough', 'talk', 'say', 'never', 'quite', 'getting', 'right.You', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'Peter', 'Lorre', 'cast', 'list', 'knife-throwing', 'sleazy', 'villain', 'type', 'role', 'usually', 'portrayed', 'conventional', 'noir', 'films', 'completely', 'straight', 'why', 'never', 'provoking', 'laughter', 'one', 'anchors', 'film', 'providing', 'weight', 'jokes', 'said', 'still', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'funniest', 'parody', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'sections', 'movie', 'drag', 'More', 'few', 'jokes', 'drop', 'clang', 'many', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'predictable', 'Lon', 'Cheney', 'Jr.', 'character', 'bit', 'too', 'stereotypical', 'stupid', 'be', 'truly', 'amusing.I', 'Digiview', 'release', 'DVD', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'more', 'adequate', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'better', 'versions', 'movie', 'available', 'purchase', 'given', 'how', 'cheap', 'can', 'find', 'edition', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'pass', 'up.You', 'can', 'find', 'DVD', 'available', 'virtually', 'money', 'think', 'single', 'dollar', 'splurged', 'was', 'buck', 'well', 'spent', ""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'fact', 'think', 'only', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'actually', 'liked', 'entertaining', 'short', 'eighty-eight', 'minutes', 'like', 'film', 'noir', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'few', 'digs', 'genre', 'take', 'chance', 'not', ""'ll"", 'be', 'risking', 'huge', 'amount', 'money']",N/A

The sound quality is a bit low, it looks like it could use a bit of remastering visually as well.As far as the actual movie goes--it takes a few moments to get into the plot as it is a framed narrative, most of it taking place in the immediate past getting the viewers up to date with the current situation (Bob Hope in San Quentin).  It gets very enjoyable after that, a few confusing moments--a result of a bit of sloppy spoofing. However, mostly it is done very well, anyone familiar with the hard boiled detective genre, film or book will enjoy this for its light hearted take on it.Lamour and Hope play perfectly off each other there is also a nice blink and you miss it cameo by their on the road co-star, Bing Crosby.I really did enjoy this though, but not the very very very best.

""Brunette"" has an impressive supporting cast including Peter Lorre, Lon Chaney Jr, John Hoyt, Ann Doran, Reginald Denny, Ray Teal, Jack la Rue, and features a couple of surprise star cameos.Hope plays baby photographer Ronnie Jackson but his heart is set on becoming a private detective (""All my life I've wanted to be a hard boiled detective like Humphrey Bogart, or Dick Powell, or even Alan Ladd!""). Dorothy Lamour is Carlotta Montay and she mistakes Hope for Sam McCloud who is a qualified private detective and has the office next door to Hope. Lamour hires Hope to look for her missing uncle who has been kidnapped but after various misadventures she realises just how inexperienced he is! After being exposed to great danger and becoming a target for the villains Hope begins to regret his deception.

197575,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6300158489,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 1]","In this crackpot comedy from 1947, Bob Hope plays a baby photographer who dreams of becoming a detective.  When an exotic brunette by the name of Carlotta Montay (Dorothy Lamour) mistakes him for a detective, he decides to throw caution to the wind and handle her case himself.  A detective only needs smarts, courage, and a gun, and he has a gun; he has even invented a camera that takes pictures through keyholes.  Carlotta says her husband is missing, although she later changes her story to say it is her uncle.  When Jackson comes out to the house, he meets the missing uncle and starts to believe Carlotta is rowing upstream without a paddle, but Ronnie Jackson (Bob Hope) is not one to leave a gorgeous brunette in distress.  To him, being a detective basically involves making time with beautiful female clients.  Soon, as there really are all sorts of thug-induced shenanigans going on, Jackson is in over his head, eventually finding himself framed for a murder he didn't commit.My Favorite Brunette features vintage Bob Hope comedy.  He has one-liners for even the darkest of occasions; he even complains jokingly about his last meal when he is locked up in the hoosegow awaiting execution.  Dorothy Lamour's character remains serious and reserved throughout, but this doesn't slow Bob Hope down, as he quite easily carries the movie's load of comedy single-handedly.  As always with Hope, the comedy comes out in so many ways, particularly in the facial expressions; I don't think the man could ever have been not funny if he tried.  The ending of this movie screams deus ex machina, but it really doesn't matter.  My Favorite Brunette features an hour and a half of Bob Hope comedy in its most concentrated and effective form, guaranteeing a ton of laughs for anyone with a funny bone in his/her body.

As Ronnie spins his tale, the camera pans back in time to San Francisco as Ronnie plies his baby photography trade. Ronnie has always wanted to be a part of the McCloud Detective Agency. He gets a chance when McCloud is away and the Baroness Carlotta Montay assumes Ronnie is a real private eye and hires him to search for her missing husband (later, she changes it to a missing uncle). Soon, Ronnie is nose-deep in side-splitting danger, mysterious maps, escapades in a brooding mansion and a shady sanitorium, and potentially crazy brunettes.With this 1947 thriller-comedy, Bob Hope is back in perilous surroundings. But, this time, his allegiance is shifted from his favorite blonde, Madeleine Carroll, to his favorite brunette, Dorothy Lamour. The look of this film is very dark, with many scenes taking place at night or in very dim locations. Everyone but Bob plays it straight and, if not for Bob's constant barrage of humor, this easily could have been a typical film noir. As it is, old Ski-nose zanily spins plenty of detective cliches.Dorothy Lamour teams up again with familiar co-star Bob in this ""Road""-less enterprise and makes the most of her sarong-free femme fatale role. There's a certain comfort level between Dorothy and Bob that translates very well onto the film. But just when you think this movie is Crosby-bereft, guess who has a cameo somewhere in the film? Charles Dingle, Frank Puglia and John Hoyt have nice supporting roles, with Lon Chaney Jr. and the great but creepy Peter Lorre rounding off the cast nicely. Alan Ladd also has a tiny but amusing cameo.At this stage of his career, Bob Hope had already perfected his screen persona of cowardly, self-deprecating funnyman. As usual, the jokes come in fast and furious, in strafe-like fashion. My Favorite Brunette is yet another excellent showcase for Bob's natural timing and hilarious one-liners.Ironically, the funniest line of the movie is uttered not by Bob Hope, but by a state trooper (threatening Hope): ""If you bother us again, I'll personally punch you in the nose so hard it will look like other peoples' noses."" The second funniest line is said by Bob Hope as he reaches up into a chandelier and pulls out a champagne bottle: ""Aha! Ray Milland's been here!""

I have been a big fan of this movie for a very long time.  I have seen it played on commercial television since I was a kid, and more recently by live streaming on Netflix.  I never really considered to be part of the &#34;Film Noir&#34; style of movie making.  I don't know if the original intention was for it to be film noir or not, but in the many times I have viewed it in the past, it certainly didn't seem be as dark and menacing as most film noir movies come across.  This movie is a spoof on detective films, whether or not the use of black and white was supposed to reflect what would be film noir or not is a mystery to me.  But I don't remember it being film noir the many times that I have seen it in the past.  This DVD version is very dark though, it shows the great wear and tear of age.  I was hoping that it had been somewhat restored, but it is not anything like the live streamed version I recently saw on Netflix.  This DVD was made by Alpha Video, there are other copies made by other companies but I doubt that they are of any better quality than this one is.

197595,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6300158489,Randy Keehn,"[2, 2]","I grew up familiar with Bob Hope as a movie comedian and my memory of his humor was fairly positive.  I hadn't seen any of his movies for years and when I had the chance recently, I came away disappointed.  I was beginning to wonder if I was a poor judge of humor in my youth but I think ""My Favorite Brunette"" set me straight.  This is a funny movie and brings out all of Hope talents as a comedian.  It helps that the movie itself is a satire on the ""Film Noir"" standard of the '40's and early '50's.  Alan Ladd does a cameo appearance as the hard-boiled private eye that Ronnie Jackson (Bob Hope) aspires to become.  An opportunity falls in his lap and off we go.  Hope bounces from crisis to crisis alternating his expert talent at wise-cracking with his own self-deprecating humor.  I thought the movie was aided by a decent cast of characters including the likes of Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney Jr.  There was enough of a mystery in the plot to add to the interest level.  However, this movie was a vehicle for Bob Hope and it suceeds because of how well he delivers.I was glad to be able to ""rediscover"" Hope as a comedian and I thought about how I got misdirected recently.  I realized that what I had been watching of late were ""Road to..."" movies where he teamed up with Bing Crosby.  I realized that, despite the popularity of this team, those movies stifled Hope's talents.  I remembered some of his movies that I liked so well from my youth and I realized that none of them included Crosby.  It's just a theory but I enjoyed the way that Hope plays his style of humor off everyone and I think it suffered when he had to focus that style primarily on one ploy (Crosby).  Maybe I'm not giving enough credit to the writers but watch ""My Favorite Brunette"" and then watch any of the ""Road"" movies and see if you don't detect a noticable decline in the quality of Hope's screen persona.

I don't mind black & white (please don't colorize it!), but the picture quality isn't as clear as other films made at the same time.  But for this caliber of humor, I'll put up with an imperfect video quality.  Plus you get to see a young Alan Ladd, although briefly.  Dorothy Lamour is at her best in this film.  She looks great, acts well and sings very nicely!  Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney Jr are great also.  I would place this in my top 3 Bob Hope films.

197597,A2P524H15RSAKC,6300158489,"Samuel DeLong ""Movie Goer""","[0, 0]","My Favorite Brunette is a classic that has apparantly been rescued. Hope is cast as a Baby Photographer who wants to change careers. He wants to be a detective. His studio is located in an office building in San Francisco juxtaposed to that of adetective who is played by Alan Ladd in a cameo role.Hope is alone when Dorothy Lamour comes into the office and asks for help mistaking Hope for a detective. She says that she wants help in finding her missing husband she also gives Hope a map and instructs him to guard it with his life. She then gives him an address outside San Franciso where he is to meet her.Then the movie takes off. Hope encounters Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney Jr. among others. Lamour's sanity is questioned. Hope goes from location to location trying to solve the mystery. Hope even ends up in the gas chamber for murder. It is hard to tell where it will end or what will happen next but is all great fun. The laughs never stop. The pacing is fast but easy to follow. The only caveat is that the copy is not as pristine as would be desired but it is probably the best that could be provided for the transfer. I believe that one reason for this is that for some reason it does not seem to be owned by Paramount and therefore has not been preserved except for what we have here. The sound track is better than I expected. I believe this to be one of Hope's best and is a ""must see"" for all his fans. Bing Crosby has a cameo at the end of the picture. Once you start towatch this picture you probably won't notice the quality of the print: it is that good !  The direction is excellent, the quality of the production is very high.

Well, folks, I've got news for you, it's not.  Perhaps they meant that it was remastered in a mysterious basement somewhere taken from a print that can't count itself higher than 8mm.  It really is too bad, given that this is one of my favorite movies.  A film that makes a comedy out of being a Private Eye, puts Bob Hope in the role of a baby photographer that takes the place of his P.I. friend when he goes out of town for a couple of days.  Bob Hope is quick and funny and it's not campy, but quite witty and an enjoyable watch.  There are no good transfers out yet that I've seen of this film and I jumped at this when I saw ""remastered"" in the title.  The transfer here is completely average, not great, but watchable with some skipping of audio throughout as well.  The studio for this DVD review is A2ZCDS.
