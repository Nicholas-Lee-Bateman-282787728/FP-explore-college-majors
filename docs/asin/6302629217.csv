But per the sources I did note (including here on Amazon)-- it's not completely off, either. I loved the glimpse that this movie gives into the Hasidic world, the ultra-conservative, gender-segregated culture that few of us Gentiles understand or of which we even have the opportunity to be exposed. I enjoyed the contrast of Melanie Griffith's tough, jaded lady-cop against the Orthodox community as she tries to solve a murder among them; one seems either to like Griffith's gentle style, or not, but it fits in this type of story where a steamroller-type modern-babe-type would not have worked. Loved her interactions with the old rabbi and the shared pain and understanding between them. Loved the sexual tension between her and the rabbi's adopted son, Ariel, who makes sidelocks look HOT and whose sexual purity, as he struggles with finding his 'beshert' and staying a virgin for her in spite of his attraction to Griffith, is touching.The crime plot is very simplistic and merely a backdrop to contrasting the very different worlds of the characters, so don't look for heavy crime-drama here; it's mostly about Griffith's character growing as she brushes sleeves with people vastly different from her, and what she discovers about herself in the process. There is Pollan's weak and histrionic character portrayal, but it doesn't ruin this story for me in any way; in fact, it only highlighted the positive aspects.",4,Gentile gives a thumbs-up,1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,1562,"['Okay', ""'m"", 'not', 'Jewish', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'scanty', 'info', 'reviews', 'others', 'how', 'accurate', 'movie', 'Orthodox', 'Judaism', 'sources', 'did', 'note', 'including', 'here', 'Amazon', 'not', 'completely', 'loved', 'glimpse', 'movie', 'Hasidic', 'world', 'ultra-conservative', 'gender-segregated', 'culture', 'few', 'Gentiles', 'understand', 'even', 'have', 'opportunity', 'be', 'exposed', 'enjoyed', 'contrast', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'tough', 'jaded', 'lady-cop', 'Orthodox', 'community', 'solve', 'murder', 'one', 'Griffith', 'gentle', 'style', 'not', 'type', 'story', 'where', 'steamroller-type', 'modern-babe-type', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'Loved', 'interactions', 'old', 'rabbi', 'shared', 'pain', 'understanding', 'Loved', 'sexual', 'tension', 'rabbi', 'adopted', 'son', 'Ariel', 'who', 'sidelocks', 'look', 'HOT', 'sexual', 'purity', 'finding', ""'beshert"", 'staying', 'virgin', 'spite', 'attraction', 'Griffith', 'touching.The', 'crime', 'plot', 'very', 'simplistic', 'merely', 'backdrop', 'contrasting', 'very', 'different', 'worlds', 'characters', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'heavy', 'crime-drama', 'here', 'mostly', 'Griffith', 'character', 'growing', 'sleeves', 'people', 'vastly', 'different', 'what', 'process', 'Pollan', 'weak', 'histrionic', 'character', 'portrayal', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'story', 'way', 'fact', 'only', 'highlighted', 'positive', 'aspects']",N/A

Not long into the story the missing person is found (DEAD). The victim is a member of a closed trusting society. This leads the detective to draw the conclusion that it had to be the unthinkable; ""an inside job"" by someone(s) trusted. The solution is to go undercover and wait for an opportunity to identify the perpetrator(s).The detective story is the veneer of the movie however it is integral enough to include Emily's background friends and past environment. This fleshes out Emily's character and the choices she made in life.The choice of Melanie Griffith as someone hardboiled and expounding the things she has scene is stretching it a bit. Also as with some one playing a kids role she acts more like a three year old. And occasionally the terrible two's. However by the end of the film we forget this and except the character. Most of the other actors fit their characters well.

Lumet takes Ford's sojourn among the Amish of Pennsylvania and transmogrifies it into Melanie Griffith's sojourn among the Hasidim of Brooklyn.Lumet does his usual splendid job of presenting New York City dynamically and organically, not just as a city of steel and glass, walls and bridges, towers and tunnels, but as a place where people live.Lumet couldn't have found a more shiksa-ish shiksa to play the shiksa than Melanie Griffith, but Griffith doesn't carry the role of tough as nails plainclothes Detective NYPD Emily Eden very well. To start, the name ""Emily Eden"" is redolent of crinolines, bubble baths, and lavender. Sure, her character is as crude, profane and inappropriate a cop as the role demands in the face of the exclusively Commandment-driven life of the Hasidim, but Griffith herself is as soft and squeaky as a plush toy. She's CUTE, which makes her very unbelievable.This would have been a breakthrough role for the beautiful, hard-edged Theresa Russell a la IMPULSE, but chalk it all up to a missed opportunity. Good supporting roles are played by Tracy Pollan as Mara and James Gandolfini in his debut performance as---guess what--a Mafiosi.The plot is strictly generic and off-the-shelf. One of the younger Hasidic diamond merchants is murdered, and all evidence points to it being an inside job. Assigned as investigator, Griffith is posted in the home of the aged Rebbe, a Holocaust survivor, and becomes acquainted with, and then attracted to, his adopted son and lineage heir Ariel.This film excels (and it does excel) in giving the general audience a glimpse into the close-knit community and mutually interdependent lifestyle of Hasidic Jews. This may not seem like a very big acheivement in our fractionalized modern world, but the film is a wonderful vehicle for presenting the multiculturalism of New York's varied communities with respect. The people portrayed in this film become far less alien, familiar and likeable---understandable---when seen through Lumet's lens.

323703,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6302629217,Lawyeraau,"[12, 23]","I initially debated whether to give this movie two or three stars, as at times it was moderately enjoyable. Some parts of it were so absurd, however, as to defy the viewer's imagination and intelligence. Moreover, Melanie Griffith was decidely miscast for the role she played. A hard boiled detective with a breathy, little girl voice like Marilyn Monroe just doesn't cut it. So, I gave the film its just desserts and awarded it the two stars it deserves.The film revolves around the murder of a Hasidic man in a jewelry store in the diamond district of New York. Emily Eden (Melanie Griffith), an angst ridden and tough, hard nosed NYPD detective with the sexual scruples of a cat in heat, is assigned to cover the murder. She goes to Brooklyn to debrief the Rebbe (Lee Richardson), as to his knowledge of the victim, and shows up inappropriately attired. Now, NYPD may be a lot of things, but totally stupid thay are not. NYPD would never have allowed a detective, who did not have some understanding and familiarity with the customs of the Hasidic community, enter that community to try and get information. Nor would the Detective, a woman, have gone alone, given the Hasidic community's beliefs about the roles of men and women.Though Detective Eden sounds decidely stupid throughout the film, she is smart enough to figure out that it was probably someone from the community who did the murder, given the nature and condition of the crime scene. In order to properly investigate, however, she believes that she needs to infiltrate the Hasidic community and go undercover, as a ba'al teshuvah, a Jew who has chosen to embrace an orthodox life style. So, she dyes her bleached, blonde hair brown, dresses conservatively, and goes to live with the Rebbe, his hunky son, Ariel (Eric Thal), and Mara (Tracy Pollan), the Rebbe's adopted daughter. Detective Eden lusts after Ariel, who is attracted to her. She has heart warming talks with Mara. Totally ignorant of the ways of the Hasidim, she manages to break many of its rules, with Mara always hovering around to correct her. She doen't seem to do much investigating, however, defeating the whole purpose of the charade.Somehow, the murder gets solved without doing too much investigation, so if the viewer is looking for a police procedural, prepare to be disappointed. If the viewer is looking for a cultural appreciation of the Hasidic community, prepare to be disappointed. This is a romanticized and absurd portrayal of this unique and insular community. If the viewer is looking for a cross-cultural romance, prepare to be disappointed, as the budding romance between Emily and Ariel finally fizzles and is never consummated. If the viewer is looking for a film about renewal of one's faith in one's self and personal redemption, the movie sort of heads in that direction but never explains the route it takes, so when it sort of arrives at its destination,  no one can figure out how.This is a film that had potential, but somewhere along the way veteran director, Sidney Lumet, dropped the ball. It is simply not ready for prime time.

323708,A1A4LUBU9NZ5CJ,6302629217,Music & Movie Luver,"[1, 2]","Melanie Griffith is an underrated actress. She shows emotions well with her eyes & facial expressions. I give her credit for attempting a different kind of role in 1992. I imagine this was considered ""career growth"" in her opinion, knowing she could not play the ingenue, hooker, bimbo, Goth-girl forever. So I don't see her miscast as a cop at that point in her career. This film tries to be many things at once & has some loose ends. Initially, one would think this is a love story, but it really isn't. Emily (Griffith) & Ariel (Eric Thal) look at each other alot but there aren't many sparks flying. As a police drama it falls short there too, because we don't see Emily doing much investigating, just living among the Hasidic Jews & getting a feel & appreciation for their lifestyle. The depiction of the Hasidic Jews, shot in sepia tones, may be inaccurate at times but I feel it's the film's strongest point. The characters also tend to be too stereotyped. Emily's father appears to be an Irish alcoholic, the gangsters (James Gandolfini & Chris Latta) are Italian. Det. Levine (John Pankow)is an anti-semitic Jew calling the Hasidic Jews ""an embarrassment"" while showing ignorance of their customs, & the rebbe sounds like he's doing an impersonation of Jackie Mason. I also think the scene when Emily first arrives in their neighborhood while ""Fiddler On The Roof"" type music plays on the soundtrack is a bit over-the-top. She also seems in awe of the area which is farfetched since she's a New York cop who must have driven through it more than once. As for the loose ends, we never find out who helped the killer & assisted her to place the body where it was found, & was Emily really at the wedding or just ""in spirit""? Also, when Emily realizes who the killer really is, it just seemed like an  afterthought to the love story that never materialized. I still recommend this movie because it has Melanie Griffth & shows a culture that is not often depicted in films.",3,"""What's New & Exciting?""",1095379200,"09 17, 2004",2004,1978,"['Melanie', 'Griffith', 'underrated', 'actress', 'emotions', 'well', 'eyes', 'facial', 'expressions', 'give', 'credit', 'attempting', 'different', 'kind', 'role', '1992', 'imagine', 'was', 'considered', 'career', 'growth', 'opinion', 'knowing', 'could', 'not', 'play', 'ingenue', 'hooker', 'bimbo', 'Goth-girl', 'forever', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'miscast', 'cop', 'point', 'career', 'film', 'be', 'many', 'things', 'once', 'loose', 'ends', 'Initially', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'love', 'story', 'really', ""n't"", 'Emily', 'Griffith', 'Ariel', 'Eric', 'Thal', 'look', 'other', 'alot', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'sparks', 'flying', 'police', 'drama', 'short', 'there', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Emily', 'doing', 'much', 'investigating', 'just', 'living', 'Hasidic', 'Jews', 'getting', 'feel', 'appreciation', 'lifestyle', 'depiction', 'Hasidic', 'Jews', 'shot', 'sepia', 'tones', 'may', 'be', 'inaccurate', 'times', 'feel', 'film', 'strongest', 'point', 'characters', 'also', 'tend', 'be', 'too', 'stereotyped', 'Emily', 'father', 'be', 'Irish', 'alcoholic', 'gangsters', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Chris', 'Latta', 'are', 'Italian', 'Det', 'Levine', 'John', 'Pankow', 'anti-semitic', 'Jew', 'calling', 'Hasidic', 'Jews', 'embarrassment', 'showing', 'ignorance', 'customs', 'rebbe', 'doing', 'impersonation', 'Jackie', 'Mason', 'also', 'think', 'scene', 'when', 'Emily', 'first', 'neighborhood', 'Fiddler', 'Roof', 'type', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'also', 'awe', 'area', 'farfetched', 'New', 'York', 'cop', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'driven', 'more', 'once', 'loose', 'ends', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'helped', 'killer', 'assisted', 'place', 'body', 'where', 'was', 'found', 'was', 'Emily', 'really', 'wedding', 'just', 'spirit', 'Also', 'when', 'Emily', 'who', 'killer', 'really', 'just', 'seemed', 'afterthought', 'love', 'story', 'never', 'materialized', 'still', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Melanie', 'Griffth', 'culture', 'not', 'often', 'depicted', 'films']",N/A

323710,A3QGRSZ7VTV0SY,6302629217,Rabbi Yonassan Gershom,"[107, 111]","OK, so it's not the best film in terms of police procedurals -- if you are looking for a hard-core crime drama, this isn't it.  This movie was a spin-off from ""Witness,"" which took place in the Amish community, and, like ""Witness,"" the real value of ""Stranger"" is in the multi-cultural details and dialogue.  The murder mystery is just a formula plot for presenting an introduction to Hasidic culture.  Viewed as such, the film can be a useful teaching tool, and that's why I've been recommending it on my website's Hasidism FAQ.  I myself use it in social studies classes here in rural Minnesota, where most of the students have never met any Jews at all, let alone Hasidim.Now granted, there are some things in the film that are pure Hollywood, such as the little book referred to as ""The Kabbalah"" that reads like a sex manual.  In real life, ""kabbalah"" is a collective term referring to Jewish mysticism.  There is no one book called ""The Kabbalah"" any more than there is any one book called ""The Zen.""  Although some kabbalstic texts do contain certain sexual imagery, the stuff that Ariel reads to Emily in the film is more like erotic love poetry.  This serves a purpose in the story, but it's not Jewishly accurate, and for that, I'm docking it a star.  On the other hand, the film does address some of the negative stereotypes about Hasidim, such as that ridiculous urban legend about the hole in the sheet. (NOT!)The real ""kabbalah"" of the film is in the message about finding one's soulmate.  In the beginning of the film, Ariel reads a line from his kabbalah book: ""God counts the tears of women.""  He has no idea what this means, it's just words.  Later, at the end of the movie, Ariel's Hasidic bride-to-be quotes this same line back to him.  She explains what it means, then says: ""It's in the kabbalah.""  From this, we know that they are true soulmates, even though this is the first time they have met face-to-face.  Emily (the detective) has also decided to wait for her true soulmate, which is what she tells Levine, who has been making passes at her throughout the film.  But Emily has now grown in her understanding of relationships, and knows that fooling around with the Levines of the world is not love.There are some fine Hasidic scenes in the film, such as the Sabbath celebration, which shows both men's and a women's dance circles.  Especially nice is the inclusion of a black couple at the Rebbe's table, presumably representing the Ethiopian Jews.  The wedding scene is also well done.  (Trivia: the music used for the wedding march is a Bobover Hasidic tune for ""Lecha Dodi,"" the song which welcomes the Sabbath Bride of Friday night.) It is for these scenes that I find the film most useful in mlti-cultural education.",4,The real value is in the multi-cultural dialogues,1035417600,"10 24, 2002",2002,2750,"['OK', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'terms', 'police', 'procedurals', 'are', 'looking', 'hard-core', 'crime', 'drama', ""n't"", 'movie', 'was', 'spin-off', 'Witness', 'took', 'place', 'Amish', 'community', 'Witness', 'real', 'value', 'Stranger', 'multi-cultural', 'details', 'dialogue', 'murder', 'mystery', 'just', 'formula', 'plot', 'presenting', 'introduction', 'Hasidic', 'culture', 'Viewed', 'such', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'useful', 'teaching', 'tool', 'why', ""'ve"", 'been', 'recommending', 'website', 'Hasidism', 'FAQ', 'use', 'social', 'studies', 'classes', 'here', 'rural', 'Minnesota', 'where', 'most', 'students', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'Jews', 'let', 'alone', 'Hasidim.Now', 'granted', 'are', 'things', 'film', 'are', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'such', 'little', 'book', 'referred', 'Kabbalah', 'sex', 'manual', 'real', 'life', 'kabbalah', 'collective', 'term', 'referring', 'Jewish', 'mysticism', 'one', 'book', 'called', 'Kabbalah', 'more', 'one', 'book', 'called', 'Zen', 'kabbalstic', 'texts', 'do', 'contain', 'certain', 'sexual', 'imagery', 'stuff', 'Ariel', 'Emily', 'film', 'more', 'erotic', 'love', 'poetry', 'purpose', 'story', 'not', 'Jewishly', 'accurate', ""'m"", 'docking', 'star', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'address', 'negative', 'stereotypes', 'Hasidim', 'such', 'ridiculous', 'urban', 'legend', 'hole', 'sheet', 'NOT', 'real', 'kabbalah', 'film', 'message', 'finding', 'one', 'soulmate', 'beginning', 'film', 'Ariel', 'line', 'kabbalah', 'book', 'God', 'tears', 'women', 'idea', 'what', 'just', 'words', 'Later', 'end', 'movie', 'Ariel', 'Hasidic', 'bride-to-be', 'quotes', 'same', 'line', 'back', 'what', 'then', 'kabbalah', 'know', 'are', 'true', 'soulmates', 'even', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'met', 'face-to-face', 'Emily', 'detective', 'also', 'decided', 'wait', 'true', 'soulmate', 'what', 'Levine', 'who', 'been', 'making', 'passes', 'film', 'Emily', 'now', 'grown', 'understanding', 'relationships', 'fooling', 'around', 'Levines', 'world', 'not', 'are', 'fine', 'Hasidic', 'scenes', 'film', 'such', 'Sabbath', 'celebration', 'men', 'women', 'dance', 'circles', 'Especially', 'nice', 'inclusion', 'black', 'couple', 'Rebbe', 'table', 'presumably', 'representing', 'Ethiopian', 'Jews', 'wedding', 'scene', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'Trivia', 'music', 'used', 'wedding', 'march', 'Bobover', 'Hasidic', 'tune', 'Lecha', 'Dodi', 'song', 'Sabbath', 'Bride', 'Friday', 'night', 'scenes', 'find', 'film', 'most', 'useful', 'mlti-cultural', 'education']",N/A

Or maybe he agreed to make this movie before he knew that Melanie (I've talked this way since I was six) Griffith would be cast as the tough female cop who has to infiltrate Diamond District in New York City where many of the Chasidic Jews live.Actually, I'm not as surprised as most people that Griffith was cast in the first place; she was pretty gutsy in Something Wild. But she sleepwalks through this movie, as though she only took the part because she lost a bet. Her whole performance is laughable. She dyes her bleached hair brown for her &quot;cover&quot; as a Jew who has chosen &quot;tshuvah,&quot; to return from the secular world to an orthodox lifestyle. Reminds me of when Charlton Heston, acting in A Man for All Seasons, was too vain to remove his toupee, so he made the hairdressers paste a fake bald pate over his fake hair.Anyway, she's among the Chasidim ostensibly to solve the murder of a chasid who was murdered in a jewelry store, but aside from the finding of the body at the beginning, and the shoot'em up at the end, there's very little cop work. Griffith spends the middle part of the film having heart-to-hearts with the adopted daughter of the community's chief rebbe, making mistakes such as opening the dairy refrigerator on meat days, and swooning over Der Rebbe's adopted son, Ariel (means Lion of G-d).Ariel is the community's best Torah scholar, and this fact is established in a conversation with his sister, during which she says that Ariel &quot;studies Torah the way Mozart played the violin.&quot; This is merely one, and not the most serious of the errors in detail regarding Judaism. Never take the word of a female relative in assessing a Jewish man. To put it mildly, we exaggerate. They ALL walk on water.She has a failed seduction scene with him, which lacks any electricity or dramatic tension whatsoever. At the end, she has an epiphany, apparently because someone has for the first time, turned her down in order to wait for someone better. I'm not exactly sure of the logic of this; Ariel is waiting for his soulmate and won't settle for some shiksa, and from this, Griffith has now decided to wait for her soulmate too. Though, if I'm too understand the earlier innuendo, Griffith is a day late and a dollar short.Hard-core Griffith fans may like this, and people who really, REALLY like procedurals may prefer it to reruns of Diagnosis Murder, but don't watch it and expect to learn about Judaism.The impression I imagine those unfamiliar with Jewish customs would carry away is that Judaism is fraught with regulations and customs just waiting to be violated.

323714,A1103Y2G3Y7TEO,6302629217,"Thomas C. Rizzo, Jr.","[5, 6]","Director Sidney Lumet is no hack - his resume includes classics such as ""The Pawnbroker,"" ""Serpico,"" ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" and ""Network."" But every artist is entitled to the occasional misstep, and at least ""A Stranger Among Us"" is more an interesting failure than the outright disaster ""The Wiz"" was.Lumet is dealing with a number of problems here, first and foremost among them a meandering script that can't quite decide what its main storyline should be.  Ostensibly a crime drama centering on the murder of a merchant in Manhattan's diamond district (the stretch of 47th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues), it persists in wandering off in two other directions - Brooklyn's Hassidim community and its age-old traditions, and the threat of forbidden love between one of its members and the detective assigned to the case.  While the scenes involving the religious rituals and customs add nothing to the plot, they at least are interesting and informative about a culture foreign to most viewers.  Less compelling are those moments involving Ariel and Emily of the NYPD, since their interest in each other strains credulity, not only because their backgrounds make it unlikely, but due to the lack of any chemistry between Eric Thal and Melanie Griffith.Griffith is Lumet's other major problem here.  No doubt she was cast because at the time she was still Hollywood's flavor-of-the-month, but we are asked to suspend disbelief and accept her not only as a New York police officer, but as one who would be selected to go undercover and infiltrate the Jewish community and live with them as one of their own.  Dying her blonde locks brown does nothing to make Griffith less the ""shiksa"" (Gentile woman) than she obviously is, and it's unlikely anyone in Crown Heights would have mistaken her for anything but. Yet - oddly enough - although plainly she's out of her element, the fish-out-of-water aspects of the story just don't work.By the time whodunit is revealed, you may not care who was responsible for the nearly-forgotten crime lost in a jumble of sub-plots - but give it a moment or two of thought and you'll wonder how the victim's body could have been hidden where it was by the person implausibly identified as the killer. It's a plot twist that just isn't quite - forgive the pun - kosher.The actors cast as the elder Jews and the atmosphere in which they live and worship add an air of authenticity that's missing from any of the scenes involving police procedures.  Lee Richardson is impressive as the rebbe who, despite his misgivings, must welcome the street-smart female cop into his home. John Pankow, Mia Sara, and Jamey Sheridan do well in their small supporting roles, and James Gandolfini makes an appearance as a thug in a foreshadowing of his career as Tony Soprano, but Eric Thal is saddled with the almost impossible task of making us believe he would forsake his strong religious beliefs and dedication to Kabbalah for the hard-talking, gun-toting Griffith.Despite its many flaws, ""A Stranger Among Us"" is one of those films that makes a long flight, rainy day, or dateless Friday night easier to endure. As a Lumet credit, it's a far cry from ""Serpico,"" but a hell of a lot better than ""The Wiz.""",2,OY VEY!,1106870400,"01 28, 2005",2005,3225,"['Director', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'hack', 'resume', 'classics', 'such', 'Pawnbroker', 'Serpico', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'Network', 'artist', 'entitled', 'occasional', 'misstep', 'least', 'Stranger', 'Us', 'more', 'interesting', 'failure', 'outright', 'disaster', 'Wiz', 'was.Lumet', 'dealing', 'number', 'problems', 'here', 'first', 'foremost', 'meandering', 'script', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'decide', 'what', 'main', 'storyline', 'should', 'be', 'Ostensibly', 'crime', 'drama', 'centering', 'murder', 'merchant', 'Manhattan', 'diamond', 'district', 'stretch', '47th', 'Street', '5th', '6th', 'Avenues', 'wandering', 'off', 'two', 'other', 'directions', 'Brooklyn', 'Hassidim', 'community', 'age-old', 'traditions', 'threat', 'forbidden', 'love', 'one', 'members', 'detective', 'assigned', 'case', 'scenes', 'involving', 'religious', 'rituals', 'customs', 'add', 'nothing', 'plot', 'least', 'are', 'interesting', 'informative', 'culture', 'foreign', 'most', 'viewers', 'Less', 'compelling', 'are', 'moments', 'involving', 'Ariel', 'Emily', 'NYPD', 'interest', 'other', 'strains', 'credulity', 'not', 'only', 'backgrounds', 'make', 'unlikely', 'due', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'Eric', 'Thal', 'Melanie', 'Griffith.Griffith', 'Lumet', 'other', 'major', 'problem', 'here', 'No', 'doubt', 'was', 'cast', 'time', 'was', 'still', 'Hollywood', 'flavor-of-the-month', 'are', 'asked', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'accept', 'not', 'only', 'New', 'York', 'police', 'officer', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'selected', 'go', 'undercover', 'infiltrate', 'Jewish', 'community', 'live', 'one', 'own', 'Dying', 'blonde', 'locks', 'brown', 'nothing', 'make', 'Griffith', 'less', 'shiksa', 'Gentile', 'woman', 'obviously', 'unlikely', 'anyone', 'Crown', 'Heights', 'would', 'have', 'mistaken', 'anything', 'oddly', 'enough', 'plainly', 'element', 'fish-out-of-water', 'aspects', 'story', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work.By', 'time', 'whodunit', 'revealed', 'may', 'not', 'care', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'nearly-forgotten', 'crime', 'lost', 'jumble', 'sub-plots', 'give', 'moment', 'two', 'thought', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'how', 'victim', 'body', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'hidden', 'where', 'was', 'person', 'implausibly', 'identified', 'killer', 'plot', 'twist', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'forgive', 'pun', 'kosher.The', 'actors', 'cast', 'elder', 'Jews', 'atmosphere', 'live', 'worship', 'add', 'air', 'authenticity', 'missing', 'scenes', 'involving', 'police', 'procedures', 'Lee', 'Richardson', 'impressive', 'rebbe', 'who', 'misgivings', 'must', 'welcome', 'street-smart', 'female', 'cop', 'home', 'John', 'Pankow', 'Mia', 'Sara', 'Jamey', 'Sheridan', 'do', 'well', 'small', 'supporting', 'roles', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'appearance', 'thug', 'foreshadowing', 'career', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'Eric', 'Thal', 'saddled', 'almost', 'impossible', 'task', 'making', 'believe', 'would', 'forsake', 'strong', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'dedication', 'Kabbalah', 'hard-talking', 'gun-toting', 'Griffith.Despite', 'many', 'flaws', 'A', 'Stranger', 'Us', 'one', 'films', 'long', 'flight', 'rainy', 'day', 'dateless', 'Friday', 'night', 'easier', 'endure', 'Lumet', 'credit', 'far', 'cry', 'Serpico', 'hell', 'lot', 'better', 'Wiz']",N/A
323715,A3DKB9QZUJYBE3,6302629217,"Trixie ""cupcakejones""","[3, 4]","Ok, so I feel a little silly giving this movie four stars. Melanie Griffith portraying a hardened New York detective? Uh, no. The romance? Silly. The killer's identity? Not exactly a shocker. And yet I really enjoyed this movie because someone did their research. This is really a sensitive, non-prejudiced introduction to the world of Hasidim, a small, ultra-Orthodox segment of the Jewish population.The story revolves around a murder in the Hasidic community of jewelers in New York. Emily Eden (Griffith) is dispatched to investigate and ends up going undercover within the community. The film has wonderful details about Hasidic life and customs, the role of the Rebbe, the antagonism from the mainstream Jewish community, and addresses the unfortunate sheet rumor which I won't go into here. As I said, Griffith's miscasting makes Angie Dickinson's work on Police Woman appear the height of feminist role models. Mia Sara fares better as the daughter of the Rebbe (the leader and epicenter of Hasidic communities.) Also, fine work from Eric Thal as the Rebbe's son who is destined to become the next leader of the Hasidim. This film is both a guilty pleasure and a surprisingly informative introduction to a fascinating community.
