977766,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B000ER31LE,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[6, 9]","In this Swedish melodrama, Daniel, a world-famous conductor, suffers a near fatal heart attack and emotional breakdown and returns to his home village in northern Sweden which he left as a child of seven after being viciously bullied.Daniel buys the abandoned building of the local grade school and sets up house. As depicted in these early scenes, he seems shellshocked, scarcely able to speak, already three quarters dead. Unexpectedly he is drawn into the life of the village through the church choir. By training them and learning about the lives of these simple folk, Daniel begins to heal himself. Of course, he also benefits from the love of a good woman, the comely blond Lena.NOTE: THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.But the village is not all that it seems. Beneath the repressed Swedish exteriors of the singers lies a tumult of emotions. Daniel makes an enemy of the village vicar, who is tormented by guilt about sexuality and has adopted a particularly joyless form of Christianity. He is cast in the traditional mode of the stern Luthern pastor whose sterness crosses the border into cruelty and sadism, as perfected in the movies of Ingmar Bergmann. There is also Daniel's boyhood tormenter, now grown up into an awful wife abuser who batters one of the members of the choir and Daniel himself once again.The movie meanders along in an entirely predictable way. Daniel is in love but cannot find the courage and the words to express himself. He coughs at frequent intervals, reminder the viewer that he is not long for this world. There is also entirely too much blood in this movie, which ends with a cheap climax that spoils much of what has gone before.I can't say this is a bad movie -- in fact much of it is quite entertaining. But I can't call it a good movie either. It's cheap and sentimental and doesn't really face up to the issues it raises.",3,Melodramatic drama has its moments but is sadly predictable,1284249600,"09 12, 2010",2010,1867,"['Swedish', 'melodrama', 'Daniel', 'world-famous', 'conductor', 'near', 'fatal', 'heart', 'attack', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'returns', 'home', 'village', 'northern', 'Sweden', 'left', 'child', 'seven', 'being', 'viciously', 'bullied.Daniel', 'abandoned', 'building', 'local', 'grade', 'school', 'up', 'house', 'depicted', 'early', 'scenes', 'shellshocked', 'scarcely', 'able', 'speak', 'already', 'three', 'quarters', 'dead', 'Unexpectedly', 'drawn', 'life', 'village', 'church', 'choir', 'training', 'learning', 'lives', 'simple', 'folk', 'Daniel', 'heal', 'course', 'also', 'benefits', 'love', 'good', 'woman', 'comely', 'blond', 'Lena.NOTE', 'ARE', 'SPOILERS', 'IN', 'THIS', 'REVIEW.But', 'village', 'not', 'repressed', 'Swedish', 'exteriors', 'singers', 'tumult', 'emotions', 'Daniel', 'enemy', 'village', 'vicar', 'who', 'tormented', 'guilt', 'sexuality', 'adopted', 'particularly', 'joyless', 'form', 'Christianity', 'cast', 'traditional', 'mode', 'stern', 'Luthern', 'pastor', 'sterness', 'border', 'cruelty', 'sadism', 'perfected', 'movies', 'Ingmar', 'Bergmann', 'also', 'Daniel', 'boyhood', 'tormenter', 'now', 'up', 'awful', 'wife', 'abuser', 'who', 'one', 'members', 'choir', 'Daniel', 'once', 'again.The', 'movie', 'meanders', 'along', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'way', 'Daniel', 'love', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'courage', 'words', 'express', 'frequent', 'intervals', 'reminder', 'viewer', 'not', 'long', 'world', 'also', 'entirely', 'too', 'much', 'blood', 'movie', 'cheap', 'climax', 'much', 'what', 'gone', 'before.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'bad', 'movie', 'fact', 'much', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'ca', ""n't"", 'call', 'good', 'movie', 'cheap', 'sentimental', ""n't"", 'really', 'face', 'up', 'issues']",As It Is In Heaven (Så som i himmelen) [Imported] [Region 2 DVD]
977767,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B000ER31LE,Andrew Desmond,"[19, 20]","""As it is in Heaven"" is a beautiful film that, although it will not receive a wide audience due to its Swedish language and English subtitles, deserves wide acclaim.  It was nominated for an Oscar as best foreign language film.  Such a nomination was appropriate.  This is a great film.In brief, the story covers the life an acclaimed orchestra composer who, for apparent health reasons, forgoes his carer and returns to the rural town of his birth.  Here, he is asked to manage a small local church choir.  His methods are unusual and he soon earns the ire of the local minister who is straight laced and wracked by guilt.  His wife, however, yearns to break free and the choir provides the perfect opportunity.  Other members of the choir carry their own burdens including a gifted woman who is in a brutal relationship with her husband.  Again, the choir proves to provide the momentum for her to address her problems.As a study of human relationships, ""As it is in Heaven"" is a tour de force.  Do not let the language deter you from seeing this masterpiece.  It is one of the best films of the year.",5,Magnificent!,1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,1103,"['Heaven', 'beautiful', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'receive', 'wide', 'audience', 'due', 'Swedish', 'language', 'English', 'subtitles', 'deserves', 'wide', 'acclaim', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'best', 'foreign', 'language', 'film', 'nomination', 'was', 'appropriate', 'great', 'film.In', 'brief', 'story', 'life', 'acclaimed', 'orchestra', 'composer', 'who', 'apparent', 'health', 'reasons', 'carer', 'returns', 'rural', 'town', 'birth', 'Here', 'asked', 'manage', 'small', 'local', 'church', 'choir', 'methods', 'are', 'unusual', 'soon', 'ire', 'local', 'minister', 'who', 'straight', 'laced', 'wracked', 'guilt', 'wife', 'however', 'yearns', 'break', 'free', 'choir', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'Other', 'members', 'choir', 'carry', 'own', 'burdens', 'including', 'gifted', 'woman', 'who', 'brutal', 'relationship', 'husband', 'Again', 'choir', 'provide', 'momentum', 'address', 'problems.As', 'study', 'human', 'relationships', 'Heaven', 'tour', 'force', 'Do', 'not', 'let', 'language', 'deter', 'seeing', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year']",As It Is In Heaven (Så som i himmelen) [Imported] [Region 2 DVD]

A slow building film about Daniel, an international conductor, who returns to the village of his birth having not lived there since age 7. Daniel has come home for a quiet life and to confront the odd demon from his youth. What he really wants is to be left to live his life in peace and contentment - what he gets is the villagers wanting him to take an active part in conducting and developing the local church choir. Still waters run very deep in this village and many of the choir members have issues with their past and present lives. Daniel is unwittingly drawn into the lives of the villagers, but through him they are able to confront their problems and shine through. The music is good and the song Daniel writes for Gabriella, a member of the choir, is sung beautifully by her character and as you read the words of the song in this subtitled film, you easily see that this really is a song about Daniel. As the film reaches it's climax, the entire choir realise and understands that they don't need to rely on Daniel to make their voices sing in unison - what he  told them they could achieve happens spontaneously.A lovely film that deserves to be seen by a wide audience. Slow building but well worth watching to the very last credit.

977769,A1NGQO4GRYYNC1,B000ER31LE,"Dan E. Nicholas ""gotta have a book""","[1, 1]","As It Is In Heaven--This movie is about love and art and music--about becoming alive; review by 1.1.13 by Dan Nicholas, Santa Cruz MountainsI rarely gush over a film, but this 2005 Oscar nominated As It Is In Heaven (Scandinavian, subtitles, some English) has to be now among my top ten favorite flicks.  It's that good.  Skipped over by much of America, it enjoyed a two year run at one major Australian theater and was a major hit in in Western Europe and New Zealand.Have you ever sung in a choir?  Gone to church in a small town?  Loved music?  Been perhaps in love or contrarily maybe wanted to beat up somebody?  Or maybe for some time you were suffocating inside a dead marriage?  Perhaps you've worked as a minister or priest as I did for over a decade?  Or learned to hate junk religion and dead church life in general?  Or perhaps you've been at the life squelching business end of a small mind world?  (My daughter likes to say: ""Go big or go home."")  Well, if these themes touch where you live, you're in luck.  This flick is your ticket to enlightenment or at least a totally good evening of video streaming.Indeed, how can music and art touch so many places and people among all the rivers of our lives?  Because all of the arts intersect at the heart and the soul of man.This Swedish drama tells the story of Daniel Dareus (Michael Nyqvist), a small-town boy, beat up as a child for playing the violin, a tragic mishap sends him back late in life to his home village to retire to start over the last half of his life yet he ends up leading the local parish choir that wakes up an entire town. Frida Hallgren, Helen Sjoholm and Lennart Jahkel co-star in writer-director Kay Pollak's heartwarming tale.The very dream of the main character in this film, Daniel Dareus (Michael Nyqvist),  is to create music that will open hearts.  Only he has to walk through the dark valley of his own heart along the way.  All's fair in art and spiritual warfare here and it takes place in a Scandinavian village one winter and spring.Daniel is a professional musician who has to retire from Big Art in the City for health reasons.  He decides return to the village of his youth just to live and to ""listen"".  He finds on his path not only healing for his soul but for the entire town.  If ever a flick spoke of what Eastern Christians call theosis and what East and West alike call salvation, it is this film. You might think this movie is about romantic love.  And it is.  But it is more about the Eros life force that runs through all the wires of the human heart and through all the virtues along the way.  In this case the main conduit is music and the stage is a small church in a mall town.Unsafe along the way is the flip side of virtue reflected in dumb ass morality and hypocrisy often found in church, as the lead character is asked to sign on as cantor and choir director of the village parish.  Demons roused along the way include domestic violence, fear and risk taking in general.  All forces of the dark side experience a shellacking in this delightful and innocent story.My own father played the violin, loved music, tried to conquer his demons there.  I saw so much of him the next day, reflecting after last night's viewing.  My wife and I brought in the new year--2013--watching this film.  Treat your soul, I'd say, to a similar delight and stream this inspiring story.  But don't wait until the cusp of another year.",5,Music that opens the heart and the soul,1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,3435,"['Heaven', 'movie', 'love', 'art', 'music', 'becoming', 'alive', 'review', '1.1.13', 'Dan', 'Nicholas', 'Santa', 'Cruz', 'MountainsI', 'rarely', 'over', 'film', '2005', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Heaven', 'Scandinavian', 'subtitles', 'English', 'be', 'now', 'top', 'ten', 'favorite', 'flicks', 'good', 'Skipped', 'much', 'America', 'enjoyed', 'two', 'year', 'run', 'one', 'major', 'Australian', 'theater', 'was', 'major', 'hit', 'Western', 'Europe', 'New', 'Zealand.Have', 'ever', 'sung', 'choir', 'Gone', 'church', 'small', 'town', 'Loved', 'music', 'Been', 'perhaps', 'love', 'contrarily', 'maybe', 'wanted', 'beat', 'up', 'somebody', 'maybe', 'time', 'were', 'suffocating', 'dead', 'marriage', 'Perhaps', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'minister', 'priest', 'did', 'decade', 'learned', 'hate', 'junk', 'religion', 'dead', 'church', 'life', 'general', 'perhaps', ""'ve"", 'been', 'life', 'squelching', 'business', 'end', 'small', 'mind', 'world', 'daughter', 'likes', 'say', 'Go', 'big', 'go', 'home', 'Well', 'themes', 'touch', 'where', 'live', ""'re"", 'luck', 'flick', 'ticket', 'enlightenment', 'least', 'totally', 'good', 'evening', 'video', 'streaming.Indeed', 'how', 'can', 'music', 'art', 'touch', 'so', 'many', 'places', 'people', 'rivers', 'lives', 'arts', 'intersect', 'heart', 'soul', 'man.This', 'Swedish', 'drama', 'story', 'Daniel', 'Dareus', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'small-town', 'boy', 'beat', 'up', 'child', 'playing', 'violin', 'tragic', 'mishap', 'back', 'late', 'life', 'home', 'village', 'retire', 'start', 'last', 'half', 'life', 'yet', 'up', 'leading', 'local', 'parish', 'choir', 'up', 'entire', 'town', 'Frida', 'Hallgren', 'Helen', 'Sjoholm', 'Lennart', 'Jahkel', 'co-star', 'writer-director', 'Kay', 'Pollak', 'heartwarming', 'tale.The', 'very', 'dream', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'Daniel', 'Dareus', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'create', 'music', 'will', 'open', 'hearts', 'Only', 'walk', 'dark', 'valley', 'own', 'heart', 'way', 'fair', 'art', 'spiritual', 'warfare', 'here', 'place', 'Scandinavian', 'village', 'one', 'winter', 'spring.Daniel', 'professional', 'musician', 'who', 'retire', 'Big', 'Art', 'City', 'health', 'reasons', 'return', 'village', 'youth', 'just', 'live', 'listen', 'path', 'not', 'only', 'healing', 'soul', 'entire', 'town', 'ever', 'flick', 'spoke', 'what', 'Eastern', 'Christians', 'call', 'theosis', 'what', 'East', 'West', 'alike', 'call', 'salvation', 'film', 'might', 'think', 'movie', 'romantic', 'love', 'more', 'Eros', 'life', 'force', 'wires', 'human', 'heart', 'virtues', 'way', 'case', 'main', 'conduit', 'music', 'stage', 'small', 'church', 'mall', 'town.Unsafe', 'way', 'flip', 'side', 'virtue', 'reflected', 'dumb', 'ass', 'morality', 'hypocrisy', 'often', 'found', 'church', 'lead', 'character', 'asked', 'sign', 'cantor', 'choir', 'director', 'village', 'parish', 'Demons', 'roused', 'way', 'include', 'domestic', 'violence', 'fear', 'risk', 'taking', 'general', 'forces', 'dark', 'side', 'experience', 'shellacking', 'delightful', 'innocent', 'story.My', 'father', 'played', 'violin', 'loved', 'music', 'tried', 'conquer', 'demons', 'there', 'saw', 'so', 'much', 'next', 'day', 'reflecting', 'last', 'night', 'viewing', 'wife', 'brought', 'new', 'year', '2013', 'watching', 'film', 'Treat', 'soul', ""'d"", 'say', 'similar', 'delight', 'stream', 'inspiring', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'cusp', 'year']",As It Is In Heaven (Så som i himmelen) [Imported] [Region 2 DVD]

This is one that moved me, delighted me, & evoked joy, wonder & a sense of poignancy that I've not felt in years.  The acting was spot on from this talented ensemble cast, and the story is provocative, although arguably flawed in some respects.  There are a number of powerfully acted scenes, and the musical score for the film deepened the impact of those scenes for me.  I haven't seen so many fine performances from a cast like this in a while.Although not rated by the MPAA, I'd classify it as R or for mature audiences - some nudity, sexual situations & violence.  Some dialogue between the town's pastor and his wife will offend some, and the portrayal of the pastor verges on being anti-clerical and/or anti-religious.  While I chafed at times during some of those scenes, the intensity of the plot & acting overshadowed those concerns for me.

But soon, his rejoining with the music will put in motion, when he accepts to conduct the chorus of the local church. A bunch of women and men who are far to be professionals, but filled to learn and who will feel the call of this singular man due his wise indications and unforgettable teachings.As you may guess, this decision will cause a real conmotion in the town, specially two people: the spiritual leader of the town, whose inner demons take part of a double moral; while the other is an old schoolmate of daniel, who overtly abuses of his woman beating her and trying to make her life a hellish mess. At the meantime, the progressive cohesion of the group fortifies still more, giving Daniel the deserved support to undertake and surmount with bravery all the obstacles and prejudices, specially when a colossal surprise is about to come.Since ""My life as a dog"" we had not experienced such powerful, ambitious and engaging film that contains more than a simple issue to be dealt, magnificently written and better acted.Nominated as Best Foreign Film in 2004, the movie curiously has a very close appraoch respect another nominated one ""Les choristes"", being defeated by ""mar Adentro.""Nevertheless, I think the movie will shine and grow up with own light through the years to come due its profound message and emotional impact.Don't miss it!",5,Follow your bliss!,1292544000,"12 17, 2010",2010,1892,"['heaven', 'Kay', 'Pollack', 'once', 'more', 'brought', 'back', 'power', 'feelings', 'existential', 'perspective', 'where', 'childhood', 'memories', 'nurtured', 'personal', 'epic', 'renowned', 'succesful', 'director', 'famed', 'violinist', 'Daniel', 'Dareus', 'worldly', 'acclaimed', 'same', 'time', 'desperate', 'alone', 'emotionally', 'wounded', 'due', 'painful', 'memories', 'childhood.So', 'middle', 'turmoil', 'due', 'fame', 'make', 'stop', 'undertake', 'journey', 'roots', 'birthplace', 'where', 'will', 'reencounter', 'soon', 'rejoining', 'music', 'will', 'put', 'motion', 'when', 'conduct', 'chorus', 'local', 'church', 'bunch', 'women', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'far', 'be', 'professionals', 'filled', 'learn', 'who', 'will', 'feel', 'call', 'singular', 'man', 'due', 'wise', 'indications', 'unforgettable', 'teachings.As', 'may', 'guess', 'decision', 'will', 'cause', 'real', 'conmotion', 'town', 'specially', 'two', 'people', 'spiritual', 'leader', 'town', 'inner', 'demons', 'take', 'part', 'double', 'moral', 'other', 'old', 'schoolmate', 'daniel', 'who', 'overtly', 'woman', 'beating', 'trying', 'make', 'life', 'hellish', 'mess', 'meantime', 'progressive', 'cohesion', 'group', 'still', 'more', 'giving', 'Daniel', 'deserved', 'support', 'undertake', 'surmount', 'bravery', 'obstacles', 'prejudices', 'specially', 'when', 'colossal', 'surprise', 'come.Since', 'My', 'life', 'dog', 'had', 'not', 'experienced', 'such', 'powerful', 'ambitious', 'engaging', 'film', 'more', 'simple', 'issue', 'be', 'dealt', 'magnificently', 'written', 'better', 'acted.Nominated', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', '2004', 'movie', 'curiously', 'very', 'close', 'appraoch', 'respect', 'nominated', 'one', 'Les', 'choristes', 'being', 'defeated', 'mar', 'Adentro', 'Nevertheless', 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'shine', 'grow', 'up', 'own', 'light', 'years', 'come', 'due', 'profound', 'message', 'emotional', 'impact.Do', ""n't"", 'miss']",As It Is In Heaven (Så som i himmelen) [Imported] [Region 2 DVD]

I've been waiting for this Swedish film &#34;S som i himmelen&#34; to show up ever since I got a rave review from one of you in Europe over a year ago (November, 2010). I bought this DVD from Kino, which sells collectibles, but it may also be on Netflix or its equivalent, and I just found it here on Amazon! Yippee!Let's talk about it. When you were in grade school were you the bully-er or the bully-ee? Yeah, I know I made up both of those words, but you get the idea. Where in the bullying spectrum were you? Dishing it out? Taking it? Or a silent witness....This wonderful Swedish film (English captions) is about bullying in childhood and the scars that linger into adulthood. It is also about bigotry, provincialism, and shattered dreams. But WAIT! Before you shy away, let me add it is also about renewed hope, the healing power of love and the joy of community.My current heartthrob Michael Nyqvist (&#34;The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,&#34; etc...) is a celebrated orchestra conductor. He is, however, felled by a tricky heart which has forced him to an early retirement.

His artist name ensures he's incognito, but he is not allowed to remain aloof for long - the village community draws him in, and before long he is asked to become leader of the church choir, being the musical expert he is; an invitation the vicar will soon regret.Thus begins 'As it is in heaven', a movie that for a while seems to be about village quaintness and small details. But Daniel's presence in the village soon becomes a catalyst for events that will change his own life and that of those around him dramatically. The theme of 'finding your own voice', with which he starts his choral instructions, soon expands outside the confines of the rehearsals. So does the notion that all begins with listening - in the course of the story many a villager finally speaks his or her mind, and is heard. The dark undercurrents of the seemingly peaceful village community are ruthlessly exposed. Yet no matter how much is uprooted, the sense of community prevails, and staunchly loyal to their unconventional conductor the motley little village choir rises to unexpected heights. Meanwhile, Daniel falls in love, with the choir as much as with one woman in it, and confronts his childhood nemesis.It is in essence a simple story, but it is so lovingly told, and has a cast of such involving and endearing characters, that it is absolutely irresistible and ultimately incredibly moving.

Daniel (Nyqvist) is a music prodigy who has grown up and moved back to the village in which he was raised for the first 10 or so years of his life.  He's had something akin to a nervous breakdown and just wants to be left alone.  But that's not going to happen in this close-knit village.  They know he is a famous conductor and they just so happen to have a little church choir that they'd like him to consider listening to.If the screenwriter and director intended to open hearts with the movie as the musician wanted to do with his music, they succeeded with me. Commonplace human situations became original, personal and immediate so that I personally felt touched by each situation. I believe I would credit the power of music combined with the point of view of the person writing the movie. Without spoiling, I can say that I was very moved by the movie's approach to living.

However I stuck with it and I must admit that this film departs radically from Bergman in the sense that it doesn't fear to hit you over the head with its heartfelt themes.  It's not subtle!  It does have a message. It veers close to bathos and sometimes falls in.  And yet....there is something so nice about it that I can forgive all of its errors -- sort of like when you have a friend who annoys you and forgets to pay back the money you lent him, wrecks your car and doesn't remember your birthday, but who is so good hearted and loving that you have to love him back.Well, sorta like that.  On a personal level the film appealed to me because all of my grandparents came from small towns in Sweden and I grew up surrounded by Swedes...so these people and their attitudes were very familiar to me.  I had to laugh when they interrupted their intense ""group therapy"" kind of session with a call for coffee!  So if you don't have that backbground, you may be less forgiving of the faults of the film.I do think that what carried me through the obvious and predictable plot were the strong performances.  The lead, Nyquist, was wonderful!  He reminded me a bit of Richard Burton.  Seeing the joy break through his initial frozen personality was really a pleasure.  His love interest, the angelic Lena, was every bit his match. She was the moral heart of the story.  Her innate strenth, warmth and goodness, as well as her physical beauty, were wonderful to see. The world needs more people like Lena!I've read all of the low rated reviews and I have to say that I agree with many of the points they make.  I did object to the terrible stereotype the film gives the poor pastor. I'm not sure I liked the handling of the retarded boy either.  And I did find the Austrian trip and the ending much sappier than I would have liked.

977786,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B000ER31LE,Richard B. Schwartz,"[11, 16]","The film begins with an interesting premise.  A world-class conductor nearly dies from a heart attack, retires from conducting, returns to the Swedish village of his youth and purchases the now vacant local school building.  He becomes the director of the local church choir and is drawn back into the world of 'conducting' but on different terms.  This time he will seek the beauty of music without the pressures and competitiveness of international concert halls.  The setting is nicely realized, as the seasons change (mirroring the changes in the man) and there may even be some love in store for him.So what's wrong with this picture?  (Caution: SPOILERS ahead.)What's wrong is that the film is built on every conceivable romantic (as in academic romanticism) cliche.  The village churchman is a heavily-repressed pornography reader who is unable to respond to his more human and down to earth wife.  One of the village men is a former bully/current wife beater, who attempts to control his wife at every turn (while the conductor composes a song for her about personal freedom in which she will sing the solo and drive her trogladyte husband up the wall).The subtexts are: everyone is good at heart (except they aren't, here).  Community is beautiful (except that this community includes some classic lowlifes and no visible police force until the film's end).  Expression trumps skill.  The heart is more important than the head.  Performing music on a grand, highly professional level will kill you (literally wear out your heart, in the film's words).The conductor uses squirrely techniques to inspire his choir.  They dance, hold hands, emote, etc.  He tells them that the music is in the air and they must somehow draw it down and reify it.  The film ends at a music festival in Austria.  Unfortunately there is no elevator in the building and the conductor must climb the stairs, thus risking another heart attack.  He collapses in the men's room, his face bloodied when his head bounces off the plumbing pipes and radiator.  Slumped on the floor he tries to wipe the blood from his face by employing used towels from the waste paper bin.  Eventually he hears the voices of his choir through a grate; the choir's voices inspire the members of the audience.  Everyone is elevated by song.  Community is restored.

But he meets via the local businessman, a choir that could use some help, and with his expertise, he makes them into a force to be reckoned with. Of course there are some characters. Daniel, the ex conductor who goes home and finds something more; Stig, the minister who with his wife, Ingar, have their own issues dealing with God and their marriage. Gabriella, the abused wife of the town bully, Conny, who also bullied Daniel when they were young. Siv, the little goody two shoes who is too moral to let her hair down a bit and Lena, the young sweet, honest yet misguided lady who is attracted to Daniel but has her own issues and Arne, who wants the best for the choir but not necessarily for others. I think one of the best things to happen in this movie is the ending. They were supposed to sing at the competition but Daniel is unavailable, but they start singing when Tore(the mentally retarded who asks to join the chior)starts it off by singing his part and the others join in then the audience one by one joins in.

977795,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000ER31LE,Tsuyoshi,"[18, 21]","""S som i himmelen"" (""As in Heaven"" or sometimes called ""As it is in Heaven"" in English speaking countries) is a very sentimental, heart-warming, funny, and ultimately charming Swedish film that is not afraid of showing emotions. Nominated for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year in 2004, in several ways this Swedish film reminds us of an equally sentimental and touching film ""Les Choristes"" from France, which was incidentally nominated for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year in 2005.I wrote about these things about Oscar because `As in Heaven' shares a popular theme - power of music - and despite some flaws such as rather stereotyped characters, the film manages to tell its story very powerfully to the end. And we all love music, and you know that.The story is a familiar one. It is about the world-famous conductor Daniel (Michael Nyqvist) whose career is suddenly interrupted by illness. He is forced to go back to the small village where he lived as a boy. The people of this cold, snowy land welcome him as celebrity, and ask him to coach the local chorus group singing in a creaky church hall.Now you know where the story is going. Daniel accepts the job reluctantly, and finds that the singers are far from perfect. Some of them are not nice to work with, and some have problems at home. Even Daniel himself has to confront his own life when he knows it's time to change, for him and for the community.The film is, I thought, overlong with very unnecessary coda in Austria; some of the actors overact (like the tormented priest) and its rather metaphorical conclusion is hard to believe, but the film's story, familiar as it is, is strongly told with a chain of episodes. The most impressive part of the story is, for me, Daniel's love romance with free-spirited girl Lena, perfectly played by Frida Hallgren (imagine lovely Michelle Williams). In addition to the music, her sweet character is the brightest spot in the film.Not everything works, I admit, and director Kay Pollack (after 18 year absence) probably needs more subtle touch when drawing the supporting characters like a housewife suffering domestic violence or an intellectually handicapped boy. I also read the complaints on the net about the film's being melodramatic and showing too much emotion, and though my impression about the film does not change, some of their opinions are quite understandable.But I was very much attracted to the film and its characters in spite of (or perhaps because of) these sweet and sentimental moments. The film is not perfect, just like many other films in the world, but it is certain that `As in Heaven' has its power to move us with its story confidently told, positive attitudes toward life, and of course music as the bond to tie the community together.",4,Singing a Song of Heaven: Sweet Film from Sweden with a Strongly-Told Story,1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,2780,"['S', 'som', 'i', 'himmelen', 'Heaven', 'sometimes', 'called', 'Heaven', 'English', 'speaking', 'countries', 'very', 'sentimental', 'heart-warming', 'funny', 'ultimately', 'charming', 'Swedish', 'film', 'not', 'afraid', 'showing', 'emotions', 'Nominated', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', 'Year', '2004', 'several', 'ways', 'Swedish', 'film', 'equally', 'sentimental', 'touching', 'film', 'Les', 'Choristes', 'France', 'was', 'incidentally', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', 'Year', '2005.I', 'wrote', 'things', 'Oscar', 'because', 'Heaven', 'shares', 'popular', 'theme', 'power', 'music', 'flaws', 'such', 'rather', 'stereotyped', 'characters', 'film', 'tell', 'story', 'very', 'powerfully', 'end', 'love', 'music', 'know', 'that.The', 'story', 'familiar', 'one', 'world-famous', 'conductor', 'Daniel', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'career', 'suddenly', 'interrupted', 'illness', 'forced', 'go', 'back', 'small', 'village', 'where', 'lived', 'boy', 'people', 'cold', 'snowy', 'land', 'welcome', 'celebrity', 'ask', 'coach', 'local', 'chorus', 'group', 'singing', 'creaky', 'church', 'hall.Now', 'know', 'where', 'story', 'going', 'Daniel', 'job', 'reluctantly', 'singers', 'are', 'far', 'perfect', 'are', 'not', 'nice', 'work', 'have', 'problems', 'home', 'Even', 'Daniel', 'confront', 'own', 'life', 'when', 'time', 'change', 'community.The', 'film', 'thought', 'very', 'unnecessary', 'coda', 'Austria', 'actors', 'overact', 'tormented', 'priest', 'rather', 'metaphorical', 'conclusion', 'hard', 'believe', 'film', 'story', 'familiar', 'strongly', 'told', 'chain', 'episodes', 'most', 'impressive', 'part', 'story', 'Daniel', 'love', 'romance', 'free-spirited', 'girl', 'Lena', 'perfectly', 'played', 'Frida', 'Hallgren', 'imagine', 'lovely', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'addition', 'music', 'sweet', 'character', 'brightest', 'spot', 'film.Not', 'everything', 'admit', 'director', 'Kay', 'Pollack', '18', 'year', 'absence', 'probably', 'more', 'subtle', 'touch', 'when', 'drawing', 'supporting', 'characters', 'housewife', 'suffering', 'domestic', 'violence', 'intellectually', 'handicapped', 'boy', 'also', 'read', 'complaints', 'net', 'film', 'being', 'melodramatic', 'showing', 'too', 'much', 'emotion', 'impression', 'film', 'not', 'change', 'opinions', 'are', 'quite', 'understandable.But', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'attracted', 'film', 'characters', 'spite', 'perhaps', 'sweet', 'sentimental', 'moments', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'just', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'world', 'certain', 'Heaven', 'power', 'move', 'story', 'confidently', 'told', 'positive', 'attitudes', 'life', 'course', 'music', 'bond', 'tie', 'community', 'together']",As It Is In Heaven (Så som i himmelen) [Imported] [Region 2 DVD]
977796,A3T689SS856U3N,B000ER31LE,Vincent Lassauw,"[2, 3]","I picked up this movie in the second hand section of my local DVD shop as a gamble. To sum things up I can say it's an ode to life and love, rekindling the flames of our passion and the spiritual engine that drives our lives that needs renewal at times, breathing life into things considered lost.In this movie it is a man who through music brings to harmonic oscillation and revival the respectively muted and paled sounds and colors in the souls of a group of villagers in a remote snowed under Swedish village. He used to be a famous conductor, who, after a heart attack, goes back to his native village where he had an unhappy childhood to that extend that he changed his name as he became famous. As a consequence, when he returns, nobody knows his true identity; he's simply that famous conductor who, for whatever reason, has come to live in their village in the former little school building.As soon as he arrives he's approached by the local reverent to come and listen to their local choir and maybe give some advice. The reverent gets a lot more than he bargained for as the conductor soon takes over and inspires the choir members to find their true paths by opening their hearts, originally to liberate their musical talents, but soon the new found freedom spills over in their private lives.As the musical level increases of the choir, traditional patterns are let go off increasingly, which, seeing his influence on his flock wane, displeases the reverent. The line to him is crossed when he sees his own wife letting go of their rigid life style and his ice cold, stiff and loveless grip on his community starts to crumble away.The resulting tensions make the reverent fire the conductor, but the only result is the choir moving out of the church building for their rehearsals and coming together in the conductor's house. As various choir members open up their hearts, they start to make big changes in their lives that will radically change them, including that of their conductor.Literally the final chord in this movie, depending on your state of mind, will be either considered moving or sentimental. I will confess I was deeply touched by its beauty (I sang in a choir for years myself so I know how the soul can be stirred in a moment like that) and considered it a perfect ending.I think it's true for the movie as a whole, that depending on how cynical you are, this movie will annoy you (calling it just a series of clich&eacute;'s) or move you. I thought it was beautiful and will revisit it many times in the future, especially in moments I need some recharging of my own batteries.
