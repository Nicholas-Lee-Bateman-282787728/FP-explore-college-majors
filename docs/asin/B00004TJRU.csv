I was impressed with the wit and comic timing of the actors, and the subtle comedy which didn't hit you over the head to make a point.  When they came on the market in VHS format, I decided to buy them in installments, and am very happy I did.You likely know the story: Richard Briers plays Tom Good, a frustrated 40 year old draftsman who works for a plastics company.  Good and his wife Barabara (Felicity Kendall) decide to ""get back to basics"" and thereby Tom quits his job, turns the yard into a huge garden, buys chickens and pigs for livestock and decides to become self sufficient, bartering for only what they need, etc.  Not a practical life style for 1970s suburban London.  Contrasting are their neighbors: Jerry and Margo Ledbetter, played by Paul Eddington and Penelope Keith. Mr. Ledbetter is an executive in the plastics company Tom Good used to work for;  he crawls and grovels to the boss to keep his high paying job, which supports his expensive and well furnished home.  Ledbetter is a slave to his work despite finanicial prosperity;  Good doesn't answer to a boss or schedule, but faces obstacle after obstacle with his crops or livestock.The chemistry and comic timing between all 4 principal actors is very fine, and the laughs are many and frequent.  Despite the impractical plot - no one would get away with having livestock in a subdivision anywhere in the civilized world for long - this makes for wholesome entertainment.  I haven't seen the DVD version for comparison, but the VHS tapes are very good quality: clear picture, great camera work.",5,Great comedy from an impractical lifestyle,1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,1677,"['first', 'saw', 'Good', 'Neighbors', '1975-77', 'late', '1970s', 'PBS', 'shortly', 'show', 'was', 'completed', 'was', 'impressed', 'wit', 'comic', 'timing', 'actors', 'subtle', 'comedy', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'head', 'make', 'point', 'When', 'came', 'market', 'VHS', 'format', 'decided', 'buy', 'installments', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'did.You', 'likely', 'know', 'story', 'Richard', 'Briers', 'Tom', 'Good', 'frustrated', '40', 'year', 'old', 'draftsman', 'who', 'plastics', 'company', 'Good', 'wife', 'Barabara', 'Felicity', 'Kendall', 'decide', 'get', 'back', 'basics', 'thereby', 'Tom', 'job', 'yard', 'huge', 'garden', 'chickens', 'pigs', 'livestock', 'become', 'self', 'sufficient', 'bartering', 'only', 'what', 'need', 'etc', 'Not', 'practical', 'life', 'style', '1970s', 'suburban', 'London', 'Contrasting', 'are', 'neighbors', 'Jerry', 'Margo', 'Ledbetter', 'played', 'Paul', 'Eddington', 'Penelope', 'Keith', 'Mr.', 'Ledbetter', 'executive', 'plastics', 'company', 'Tom', 'Good', 'used', 'work', 'grovels', 'boss', 'keep', 'high', 'paying', 'job', 'expensive', 'well', 'furnished', 'home', 'Ledbetter', 'slave', 'work', 'finanicial', 'prosperity', 'Good', ""n't"", 'answer', 'boss', 'schedule', 'obstacle', 'obstacle', 'crops', 'livestock.The', 'chemistry', 'comic', 'timing', '4', 'principal', 'actors', 'very', 'fine', 'laughs', 'are', 'many', 'frequent', 'impractical', 'plot', 'one', 'would', 'get', 'away', 'having', 'livestock', 'subdivision', 'anywhere', 'civilized', 'world', 'long', 'wholesome', 'entertainment', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'version', 'comparison', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'quality', 'clear', 'picture', 'great', 'camera', 'work']","Good Neighbors, The Final Season VHS"

Going from brittle and castigating to touching and sincere, Keith's Margo Leadbetter is a brilliant creation of character and attitude.This ensemble show has been a staple on PBS for  years and deserves a long video life.  It is a surprise that no one  considered remaking this for American TV.  I don't think it would work as  well since part of the fun involves the very British barbs and  personalities in each episode.The peak episode of the series involves a  windbreak that Margo wishes to install in her garden.  Keith has a  brilliant three-minute monologue on why she has no sense of humor that  demonstrates her skills as an actress and the unexpected depth of the  script.",5,"Well, thank you very much. . .",961545600,"06 21, 2000",2000,744,"['Penelope', 'Keith', 'TV', 'equivalent', 'film', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Going', 'brittle', 'castigating', 'touching', 'sincere', 'Keith', 'Margo', 'Leadbetter', 'brilliant', 'creation', 'character', 'attitude.This', 'ensemble', 'show', 'been', 'staple', 'PBS', 'years', 'long', 'video', 'life', 'surprise', 'one', 'considered', 'remaking', 'American', 'TV', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'part', 'fun', 'very', 'British', 'barbs', 'personalities', 'episode.The', 'peak', 'episode', 'series', 'windbreak', 'Margo', 'install', 'garden', 'Keith', 'brilliant', 'three-minute', 'monologue', 'why', 'sense', 'humor', 'skills', 'actress', 'unexpected', 'depth', 'script']","Good Neighbors, The Final Season VHS"

The humor is engaging, and if you are a fan of such shows as &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; no doubt you will enjoy this set.

550662,A1VSB17UK2H4S4,B00004TJRU,Roy Jaruk,"[25, 32]","Acorn Media has done the fans of Good Neighbors (known in the UK as The Good Life) a disservice with their transcription of the final series onto two DVDs.  Please bear in mind when reading this review that this is my favorite British comedy, ahead even of Monty Python's Flying Circus.The quality of the pictures is no better than fair.  I could tolerate that, because my set of off-the-air VHS tapes has been played so much that the images are almost Impressionist pastels.  I was irritated that the bonus material is of such paucity as to be not worth your time; you can find out more about the show and its players from the Internet Moive Database than you can from the DVD. But even this is bearable.What roused my anger was the fact that these brand new disks arrived in their original shrinkwrap but will not play properly.  Of the eight episodes provided, only three would play without trouble.  Of the remaining five, none would play normally; you get a portion of an episode, and then for unknown reasons the disk starts skipping as if you were fast-forwarding at 16 time normal speed.  One episode would not play at all.  And in the case of the bonus material, one part plays only in skip mode while the other won't play at all.I have waited a long time for a DVD set of Good Neighbors that could replace my worn-out VHS tapes.  It now appears that I will have to wait until BBC America deigns to produce a complete set of DVDs of one of their most popular comedies ever, before I will be able to view Good Neighbors as it originally aired.",1,A poor transcription of an excellent comedy,1052006400,"05 4, 2003",2003,1551,"['Acorn', 'Media', 'done', 'fans', 'Good', 'Neighbors', 'known', 'UK', 'Good', 'Life', 'disservice', 'transcription', 'final', 'series', 'two', 'DVDs', 'Please', 'bear', 'mind', 'when', 'reading', 'review', 'favorite', 'British', 'comedy', 'ahead', 'even', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Flying', 'Circus.The', 'quality', 'pictures', 'better', 'fair', 'could', 'tolerate', 'set', 'off-the-air', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'been', 'played', 'so', 'much', 'images', 'are', 'almost', 'Impressionist', 'pastels', 'was', 'irritated', 'bonus', 'material', 'such', 'paucity', 'be', 'not', 'time', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'show', 'players', 'Internet', 'Moive', 'Database', 'can', 'DVD', 'even', 'bearable.What', 'roused', 'anger', 'was', 'fact', 'brand', 'new', 'disks', 'arrived', 'original', 'shrinkwrap', 'will', 'not', 'play', 'properly', 'eight', 'episodes', 'provided', 'only', 'three', 'would', 'play', 'trouble', 'remaining', 'five', 'none', 'would', 'play', 'normally', 'get', 'portion', 'episode', 'then', 'unknown', 'reasons', 'disk', 'skipping', 'were', 'fast-forwarding', '16', 'time', 'normal', 'speed', 'One', 'episode', 'would', 'not', 'play', 'case', 'bonus', 'material', 'one', 'part', 'only', 'skip', 'mode', 'other', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'all.I', 'have', 'waited', 'long', 'time', 'DVD', 'set', 'Good', 'Neighbors', 'could', 'replace', 'worn-out', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'now', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'BBC', 'America', 'produce', 'complete', 'set', 'DVDs', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'comedies', 'ever', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'view', 'Good', 'Neighbors', 'originally', 'aired']","Good Neighbors, The Final Season VHS"
