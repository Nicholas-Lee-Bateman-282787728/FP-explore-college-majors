1602799,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B009W4BRJ8,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 1]","Alex is a young Jewish man living in Paris and his only apparent means of support is dealing drugs.  He is divorced and is constantly having to bail out his older brother Isaac by giving him money. At a family gathering, Alex's cousin mentions that he is opening a restaurant in Tel Aviv and Alex jumps at the chance to build a new and honest life. Alex's mother is deceased and it is clear that there are few emotional ties between Alex and his father that also lives in France.Before he can immigrate to Israel, (perform aliyah) Alex must establish his Jewish roots, something that he clearly never cared about before. He must also raise the initial funds to establish himself in Tel Aviv as well as a part of the restaurant, which means that he must make at least one big score in his drug dealing.Alex faces many problems, his conniving brother, satisfying the conditions that will allow him to perform the aliyah and managing his relationship with a woman of significance that has suddenly entered his life. When she talks to Alex about how she feels about him and his leaving and where she fits in his life, his simple reply is ""First I must do something good"" is loaded with metaphorical significance. While his drug dealing is clearly lucrative, Alex wants to be part of something bigger than himself and that involves his leaving Paris for Tel Aviv, even though he may have to fight in the Israeli army and work as a waiter. Alex is clearly not a strong Zionist, when asked he said that he really did not want to fight and perhaps kill Palestinians.With over 3 million Jews having immigrated to Israel since the founding of the state, there are unquestionably many varied stories as to the reasons and mechanisms of their aliyah. This is a story about a young man wanting to do more with his life that is simultaneously simple and very complex.

1602800,A328S9RN3U5M68,B009W4BRJ8,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","For starters, Film Movement has rescued this exceptional film from possible viewer obscurity by gaining the right to promote it in this country and for this everyone who loves fine films should be grateful. The debut film by Director Elie Wajeman who with Galle Mac&eacute; wrote the screenplay is a quiet but intense exploration of the ties that bind young men to family, to lovers, to friends and to religion.First a moment to define the title: Aliyah is the immigration of Jews from the diaspora to the land of Israel. It is one of the most basic tenets of Zionist ideology. The return to the Holy Land has been the aspiration of many Jews since the Babylonian exile. Large-scale immigration to the land of Israel began in 1882. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, more than 3 million Jews from over 90 countries have arrived in Israel.Alex Raphelson (the very handsome and gifted young French actor Pio Marma) is 27, a Jewish drug dealer in Paris who is caught between family ties and dreams of moving to a better life in Israel. His mother is dead, his father (Jean-Marie Winling) is distant, his brother Isaac (C&eacute;dric Kahn) is a ne're-do-well who is always asking Alex for money to get out of trouble, and his fellow drug dealer Nathan (David Geselson) constantly encourages Alex to make bigger sales. When Alex's cousin Mathias (Guillaume Gouix) visits Paris after completing his military service in Israel, he shares his plan to open a restaurant in Tel Aviv: Alex sees joining Mathias as a means to escape the dreary situation in Paris. Mathias is happy to have Alex join him as it will represent the religiously ambiguous Alex the opportunity to perform his Aliyah as well as add to the money Mathias must raise to open his restaurant. Alex decides to make changes and move to Israel and engages his ex-girlfriend Esther (Sarah Le Picard) to teach him Hebrew. Alex has recently met the beautiful Jeanne (Ad&egrave;le Haenel) and it is Jeanne that pleads with Alex not to make the move. But Alex is convinced that this change will serve his desire for a better life and proceeds to increase his drug sales to gain the money Mathias has set as his ticket to join the restaurant. The rigors Alex must endure (a theft of his savings by Isaac, a dangerous but lucrative big drug deal that Nathan arranges, the pain he feels leaving Jeanne) do not deter him and ultimately he flies to Israel and we are left wondering with Alex whether his Aliyah was worth it as Alex sees the bleak realities of life in Israel.This is a strongly character driven film and Pio Marma and Ad&egrave;le Haenel are brilliant and the supporting cast is very strong. Music supervisor Pascal Mayer enhances the atmosphere with excerpts from symphonic and chamber classical music. Though some may quibble about the realities of both the lives of Jews in Paris and the importance of the Aliyah, this remains an impressive and compelling film. Highly recommended.

As this excellent French film documents,that can be a far more complex process than I had ever imagined.  But that is only one reason to watch Aliyah, a complex story dealing with a man's search for his own identity and his heritage.Alex is a young drug dealer in Paris who has grown tired of constantly living in danger.  Beyond his own precarious existence he also has an older brother who constantly asks him for money, a couple of young women with whom he is in love but is unable to commit himself to one or the other, and an extended family that forces him, reluctantly, to remember that he is Jewish. When a cousin announces that he is starting a new restaurant in Tel Aviv, Alex jumps at the opportunity to move away and start a new life.  It's not a simple thing to do, however.  He needs money to buy into the business, but more importantly he has to reconnect with his Jewish heritage by, among other things, learning Hebrew.  Alex's decision and the ensuing complexities make up the bulk of the film, which is set in the gritty back streets of Paris and Tel Aviv.Aliyah asks interesting questions about how a man's heritage and family can suddenly rise up and affect his life, even if he has spent years ignoring them.  The film ends somewhat equivocally, and viewers are left to ponder just how successfully Alex will adapt to his new life and surroundings.",5,"Looking For Roots, Finding Yourself",1378684800,"09 9, 2013",2013,1427,"['Aliyah', 'refers', 'return', 'Diaspora', 'Jews', 'Israel', 'excellent', 'French', 'film', 'documents', 'can', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'process', 'had', 'ever', 'imagined', 'only', 'one', 'reason', 'watch', 'Aliyah', 'complex', 'story', 'dealing', 'man', 'search', 'own', 'identity', 'heritage.Alex', 'young', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Paris', 'who', 'grown', 'tired', 'constantly', 'living', 'danger', 'Beyond', 'own', 'precarious', 'existence', 'also', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'constantly', 'money', 'couple', 'young', 'women', 'whom', 'love', 'unable', 'commit', 'one', 'other', 'extended', 'family', 'reluctantly', 'remember', 'Jewish', 'When', 'cousin', 'starting', 'new', 'restaurant', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'Alex', 'opportunity', 'move', 'away', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'not', 'simple', 'thing', 'do', 'however', 'money', 'buy', 'business', 'more', 'importantly', 'reconnect', 'Jewish', 'heritage', 'other', 'things', 'learning', 'Hebrew', 'Alex', 'decision', 'ensuing', 'complexities', 'make', 'up', 'bulk', 'film', 'set', 'gritty', 'back', 'streets', 'Paris', 'Tel', 'Aviv.Aliyah', 'interesting', 'questions', 'how', 'man', 'heritage', 'family', 'can', 'suddenly', 'rise', 'up', 'affect', 'life', 'even', 'spent', 'years', 'ignoring', 'film', 'somewhat', 'equivocally', 'viewers', 'are', 'left', 'ponder', 'just', 'how', 'successfully', 'Alex', 'will', 'adapt', 'new', 'life', 'surroundings']",N/A

I kept waiting for a little more drama or development and it never happened. I'm sure, as some reviewers have done, you could pick up a lot on the process that Alex went through to get through Aliyah and the relationships between him, his old girlfriend, family and especially his brother but they were not very interesting either.I would have to say Aliyah just never took the story or characters far enough.",3,Nicely Filmed But Dull and Slow Plot,1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,684,"['have', 'really', 'come', 'enjoy', 'off-beat', 'movies', 'Film', 'Movement', 'one', 'fell', 'short', 'entertain', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'shot', 'was', 'full', 'beautiful', 'people', 'easy', 'eyes', 'storyline', 'subtle', 'just', 'never', 'picked', 'up', 'led', 'much', 'kept', 'waiting', 'little', 'more', 'drama', 'development', 'never', 'happened', ""'m"", 'sure', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'lot', 'process', 'Alex', 'went', 'get', 'Aliyah', 'relationships', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'family', 'especially', 'brother', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'either.I', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'Aliyah', 'just', 'never', 'took', 'story', 'characters', 'far', 'enough']",N/A
1602803,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B009W4BRJ8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 3]","In every young person's life, they must assess the path they're on and make some fairly major decisions. Is it time for a course adjustment? Is it time to embrace adult opportunities and responsibilities? And if you do decide that you want a different future, is there still time to make changes? Or have your past indiscretions defined who you will be from now on? This is the crossroads that the protagonist of Elie Wajeman's ""Aliyah"" has come to face. Alex (Pio Marma), a young drug dealer in Paris, understands that a change is in order. Although Jewish, he has never really used religion to comprehend his personal identity. When a cousin, though, decides to open a restaurant in Tel Aviv, he sees this as an opportunity to escape the life he has made for himself. Although living a criminal lifestyle, Alex also maintains an emotional and financial responsibility to his older brother Isaac (C&eacute;dric Kahn). The two are irrevocably linked and this burden has weighed heavily on the younger sibling. The ne'er-do-well Isaac has an undeniable grip on Alex. And in many ways, this unhealthy bond has caused Alex to be unable to explore his own identity free of outside pressures. And it is the relatability of these familial obligations that make ""Aliyah"" as effective as it is.Of course, no major plan to redefine your life comes without complications and obstacles. The trip has enormous financial ramifications. In lieu of more legal means, Alex must continue his dealing ways in order to fund the trip. He's just looking for that one big score that will finally be able to free him. In addition, the educational requirements necessary to enter Israel as a citizen have him confronting his religious and cultural identity in ways he's never thought about. And to further complicate matters, a blossoming romance is taking hold. But the biggest obstacle remains Isaac, the brother he wants to escape from AND not disappoint. He keeps his plan a secret for as long as possible, but there is no avoiding the destructive nature of this brotherhood. Both actors do a great job conveying the complexity inherent in this relationship. You see underlying love, but also a desperation and resentment that permeates every scene. As the movie progresses, these bonds are severely tested and these moments are the ones that resonated for me. I'm sure a lot of people will connect with the religious aspects of ""Aliyah,"" but I was most fascinated by this memorable brotherly dynamic.In order for ""Aliyah"" to succeed, you have to identify with Alex. Yes, he's a criminal, but he's trying to become a better person. It helps that Marma is extremely likable and believable. This is very much his story, a psychological dissection of who he is as a person and what made him that way. But Kahn is a major force in that tale. I thought both actors were tremendous and that's why I cared about the outcome of ""Aliyah."" In addition to the feature, this DVD's Bonus Short Film is a 15 minute entry from Israel. ""On The Road To Tel-Aviv"" tells of a country torn apart by terrorist attacks and prejudice. As bus passengers rail against an Arab rider, it elicits the paranoia and fear that must be prevalent in such circumstances. While some of the dramatics tend to be over-the-top, the short has undeniable resonance. A nice addition to the DVD. Overall, a solid entry into the Film Movement series.

1602804,A2EMIIHBL60K7L,B009W4BRJ8,Luanne Ollivier,"[0, 1]","The fifth entry in the Film on Friday series is Aliyah, directed by Elie Wajeman. (His first full length film) Aliyah was an official selection for Cannes Director's Fortnight and an official selection of many other festivals.Alex (Pio Marmai) is 27, and is living a life he seems to have happened upon. He deals drugs for a living, but his main occupation seems to be bailing his older brother out of jams - primarily by financial help, but also physically. Alex, despite his occupation is very likable, but he seems lonely and lost. His brother Isaac (Cedric Kahn) is a different story. Isaac is ignorant, demanding and self-centred and self serving. He is sure his brother will bail him out every time. And Alex does. Until he sees a glimpse of opportunity. His cousin is opening a restaurant in Tel Aviv. Alex envisions himself leaving Paris, escaping  his brother and starting a new life. Will he seize the opportunity or will Isaac stop him? How will he finance his trip? And can he make 'aliyah' - the declarations and knowledge necessary for Jews to immigrate or return to Israel. Perhaps he should stay - could Jeanne (Adele Haenel), a woman he meets at his cousin's party, be the basis of a fresh life in Paris?Pio does a fantastic job with the character of Alex. His criminal activities are not what we see first - instead it is a young man on repeat cycle - tied to his older brother . Where do the ties of familial responsibility end? I found myself constantly talking to the screen as I watched Aliyah - telling Alex to walk away from his brother and claim his life.  Pio plays Alex with a studied blank face for much of the film. But when he smiles or laughs, you get a glimpse the person he keeps under control and the man he could become. As much as I disliked the character of Isaac, I have to say that Khan played him magnificently. I wasn't sure of Jeanne's motives at first; she seemed to enjoy toying with Alex. Their scene in the caf&eacute; was revealing, but still guarded, as both characters were only able to articulate their feelings through a third person view.Wajeman plays with white back lighting in many of the scenes, giving the shot (and usually Alex) a stark, blinding moment. Music is used to great effect and I found myself humming along with the song Sugar Man by Rodrigues after the movie ended.In Aliyah, Wajeman explores familial and cultural ties and obligations juxtaposed with an individual's need to find a sense of belonging on their own terms.The ending caught me unawares and indeed, I did rewind to make sure I hadn't missed anything. At first I was disappointed and wanted a more clear cut resolution, but then thought about it again. And realized that yes, the ending was fitting.

This is the March, 2013 release in that on-going series.""Aliyah"" (2012 release from France; 88 min.) brings the story of Alex and Isaac, two French-Jewish brothers living in Paris. Alex is a 27 yr. old small time dealer in recreational drugs, and not happy with where he's at. He decides to ""make aliyah"" (i.e. move to Israel), as he sees an opportunity to make a new start there with his cousin and start a restaurant in Tel Aviv. But complications arise: his older brother Isaac is in ever worse shape, needing money constantly to stay afloat. Then at a family gathering, Alex meets Jeanne, a beautiful and intruiging woman. Will Alex and Isaac find their way out of trouble? Does Alex abandon aliyah to stay with Jeanne in Paris? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: writer-director Elie Wajeman does an excellent job of creating a believable setting of a young man pondering the possibility of moving to Israel, ostensibly to run away from his problems in Paris. But at the heart of the movie lies the troubled relationship between Alex and Isaac, with clear bibilcal overtones. This movie gathered quite a buzz upon its initial screening at the 2012 Cannes film festival, and deservedly so. The DVD extras include an (unrelated) 15 min. outstanding shortie, called ""On The Way to Tel Aviv"" (2008 Israeli release), based on true facts, about what happens when a suspect looking Arab woman boards a bus headed for Tel Aviv: could she be a terrorist? Watch! Meanwhile, ""Aliyah"" is another excellent addition to the ever-growing Film Movement library, and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,Excellent French-Jewish family drama,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,1872,"['Let', 'state', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Film', 'Movement', 'library', 'foreign', 'indie', 'movies', 'so', 'much', 'finally', 'gave', 'last', 'year', 'started', 'subscription', 'DVD', 'Month', 'club', 'March', '2013', 'release', 'on-going', 'series', 'Aliyah', '2012', 'release', 'France', '88', 'min', 'story', 'Alex', 'Isaac', 'two', 'French-Jewish', 'brothers', 'living', 'Paris', 'Alex', '27', 'yr.', 'old', 'small', 'time', 'dealer', 'recreational', 'drugs', 'not', 'happy', 'where', 'make', 'aliyah', 'i.e', 'move', 'Israel', 'opportunity', 'make', 'new', 'start', 'cousin', 'start', 'restaurant', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'complications', 'arise', 'older', 'brother', 'Isaac', 'ever', 'worse', 'shape', 'needing', 'money', 'constantly', 'stay', 'afloat', 'Then', 'family', 'gathering', 'Alex', 'Jeanne', 'beautiful', 'intruiging', 'woman', 'Will', 'Alex', 'Isaac', 'find', 'way', 'trouble', 'Does', 'Alex', 'abandon', 'aliyah', 'stay', 'Jeanne', 'Paris', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Several', 'comments', 'writer-director', 'Elie', 'Wajeman', 'excellent', 'job', 'creating', 'believable', 'setting', 'young', 'man', 'pondering', 'possibility', 'moving', 'Israel', 'ostensibly', 'run', 'away', 'problems', 'Paris', 'heart', 'movie', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'Alex', 'Isaac', 'clear', 'bibilcal', 'overtones', 'movie', 'gathered', 'quite', 'buzz', 'initial', 'screening', '2012', 'Cannes', 'film', 'festival', 'deservedly', 'so', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'unrelated', '15', 'min', 'outstanding', 'shortie', 'called', 'Way', 'Tel', 'Aviv', '2008', 'Israeli', 'release', 'based', 'true', 'facts', 'what', 'when', 'suspect', 'looking', 'Arab', 'woman', 'bus', 'headed', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'could', 'be', 'terrorist', 'Watch', 'Meanwhile', 'Aliyah', 'excellent', 'addition', 'ever-growing', 'Film', 'Movement', 'library', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A
1602806,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B009W4BRJ8,Stephen M. Lerch,"[0, 1]","Aliyah had promise that I believe was squandered.The idea behind many an art house/art film is a slice of life of someone. In this case, the slice of life is from a Frenchman who has decided, seemingly on a whim, to make Aliyah, or to move to Israel and become an Israeli. He has good reason for doing so, mostly to get away from his waste of a brother, but given he has dealt with this joke for YEARS by the time the film starts, one must ask, why now? And the answer is... it's his whim and nothing more. In passing a friend mentions he is opening a restaurant in Tel Aviv and Alex, the main character, suddenly asks to come along.OK, the premise isn't horrible, but given the way the film plays out, you REALLY need to make the main character likeable. Make him someone who want to know what happens to him at the end of the film. And that's the problem. The main character is a drug dealer, bottom of the drug dealing business. He CLAIMS he's giving it up, but uses it throughout the movie to fund his travel to Israel. He tells everyone he has given it up, but they all know better. He has no real job, so how else would he be making money? And even a drug dealer could be deserving of some personal interest from the viewer, but this guy is so carefree and worthless that by the time the film ends, panning away from him on the balcony of his apartment in Tel Aviv, I found myself thinking ""who cares what happens to this guy? He could fall off the balcony and die and I wouldn't have cared about him. Apparently I'm supposed to actually come to like this guy, to care about him, by the end of the film but all I felt was an overriding dislike for his carefree, worthless attitude, despite them showing him in the last TEN MINUTES of the film becoming a little more useful than he was in the other 78 minutes of the film.And this brings me to my review title. Boring. I realize the slow nature of an art film (or what's generally accepted as such). I realize a slice of life film focuses on the little things. But it also relies on you having worthwhile and likeable characters when you approach this subject matter.Shun Li and the Poet, another Film Movement film, is of a similar genre and by the end of the film I legitimately felt SOMETHING about the characters and the way it ended. At the end of this, nothing.In terms of the DVD, the video quality is good. The cinematography was good. The audio is French with optional English subtitles. The subtitles are legible and while I don't know French, I assume Film Movement used subtitles of similar quality as previous releases, so I assume the translation is pretty faithful. You can also watch in Stereo or Surround 5.1. The 5.1 mix is pretty pointless given the dialog driven narrative of the film, and the 5.1 sound stage isn't really utilized to any great extent.Overall:Boring. Lifeless characters that you will feel no compassion for hinder what could have been a poignant tale. Instead the emotion falls flat and you're left with 88 minutes of boredom.5 stars for the DVD authoring, 3 stars for a boring story. If you can see it for free and have nothing better to do with 88 minutes, it's an OK watch. Maybe. I'm struggling with 3 stars or 2.Skip this one.Disclaimer- I received an advance copy for review purposes from the publisher.

1602807,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B009W4BRJ8,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 2]","Alex is a Jewish man living in Paris; he has a brother, Isaac who is a leech on him both financially and emotionally. With their mother dead they are finding it hard to be good family members. This is exacerbated by the fact that neither has day jobs and Alex is a drug dealer albeit small time. Then he gets an offer to move to Tel Aviv to co own and run a restaurant and he sees it as the perfect way to get out of the cycle of meaningless living that he has fallen into.This means he is doing the `aliyah' which is when a Jew returns to Israel or comes home. He starts to learn Hebrew and has to get his money together. At the same time he meets and falls for the lovely Jeanne (Adele Haenel `Three Worlds' and `Les Diables'). As he ups his drug dealing to get the cash together, things start to go wrong and he has to make some hard decisions about what he really wants and if he is prepared to really change his life and leave behind all he knows including best mate Mathias (Guillaume Gouix `Beyond the walls').This is proper story telling, it is a slice of someone's life and all the threads that go to make it up and as we change and grow so those threads can change or completely unravel. This is the first full length feature from Elie Wajeman and it is clear he has real talent; He has also managed to get some top rate if not well known actors on board so I hope we see and hear a lot more from him. The film examines the emotional and psychological pressures that friends, family, religion and circumstance can often heap upon us - sometimes almost subliminally. The beauty here is in the detail so even the background is sometimes used as a device for the tale to unfold.This is presented in French and Hebrew with good subtitles. High production values, an engrossing story and top notch acting make this a film that should be on your `watch list' as ever Film Movement have found and presented an excellent independent film, which is not available in Region 2 at the time of writing, which is a shame. This also includes a short from Wajeman `On the road to Tel Aviv' and it too is a little corker; altogether a brilliant package that I can highly recommend.",4,Brilliant tale of a French Jews struggle to find a home.,1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,2174,"['Alex', 'Jewish', 'man', 'living', 'Paris', 'brother', 'Isaac', 'who', 'leech', 'financially', 'emotionally', 'mother', 'are', 'finding', 'hard', 'be', 'good', 'family', 'members', 'exacerbated', 'fact', 'day', 'jobs', 'Alex', 'drug', 'dealer', 'small', 'time', 'Then', 'offer', 'move', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'co', 'own', 'run', 'restaurant', 'perfect', 'way', 'get', 'cycle', 'meaningless', 'living', 'fallen', 'into.This', 'doing', 'aliyah', 'when', 'Jew', 'returns', 'Israel', 'home', 'learn', 'Hebrew', 'get', 'money', 'together', 'same', 'time', 'lovely', 'Jeanne', 'Adele', 'Haenel', 'Three', 'Worlds', 'Les', 'Diables', 'drug', 'dealing', 'get', 'cash', 'together', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'wrong', 'make', 'hard', 'decisions', 'what', 'really', 'prepared', 'really', 'change', 'life', 'leave', 'including', 'best', 'mate', 'Mathias', 'Guillaume', 'Gouix', 'walls', '.This', 'proper', 'story', 'telling', 'slice', 'someone', 'life', 'threads', 'go', 'make', 'up', 'change', 'grow', 'so', 'threads', 'can', 'change', 'completely', 'unravel', 'first', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'Elie', 'Wajeman', 'clear', 'real', 'talent', 'also', 'managed', 'get', 'top', 'rate', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'board', 'hope', 'see', 'hear', 'lot', 'more', 'film', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'pressures', 'friends', 'family', 'religion', 'circumstance', 'can', 'often', 'heap', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'subliminally', 'beauty', 'here', 'detail', 'so', 'even', 'background', 'sometimes', 'used', 'device', 'tale', 'unfold.This', 'presented', 'French', 'Hebrew', 'good', 'subtitles', 'High', 'production', 'values', 'engrossing', 'story', 'top', 'notch', 'acting', 'make', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'watch', 'list', 'ever', 'Film', 'Movement', 'have', 'found', 'presented', 'excellent', 'independent', 'film', 'not', 'available', 'Region', '2', 'time', 'writing', 'shame', 'also', 'short', 'Wajeman', 'road', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'too', 'little', 'corker', 'brilliant', 'package', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

To do this, Alex must raise some cash, something that proves to be a challenge, as he makes his living as a drug dealer, and is frequently burdened with helping his manipulative older brother Isaac (Cedric Kahn) out of debt.  While preparing for this departure, Alex becomes romantically involves with Jeanne (Adele Haenel), someone who could affect his plans for the future.Alex being a drug dealer, doesn&#8217;t seem to have many moral implications, as the use of drugs is quite prevalent.  Matters seem fairly grounded in reality, if suddenly deciding to move to someplace completely new sounds plausible.  Alex&#8217;s relationships and romance provides some interest, but the film never went where I thought it might, leaving me somewhat disappointed.  Matters so take a slightly darker turn, but the attempts to conclude with some sense of poignancy, mostly miss the mark.  The acting performances are good, but as a Film Movement selection, I expected a movie with a little more substance.The short, &#8220;On the Road to Tel-Aviv&#8221; is much more impactful, and did not disappoint, as it explores events related to a suicide bombing.
