1206647,A11B53O6FW2QDC,B001JQTSFC,Amy NY1,"[0, 2]",It was hard watching this story about rich boy loves poor girl .Socially uneceptable of some backwards small town ignorant father . I had to fast foward this very poorly wriiten script . It had no originality although the actor who played Lucas did a fair job . I wanted to just scream at this abusive and ignorant story .Its characters the parents lacking all moral compass .Never less portraying good church going people. Watching the father beating his son with a belt and verbally abusing his child was just a really bad tale of ignorance . The ending was as predictable  as the script . Don't even bother watching this or you could just fast forward as I did .

Kelly ""God Loves Gaze""","[49, 72]",I was looking at gay films when this movie appeared along with other gay movies as a suggested film of interest to me. Naturally thinking it was a gay film I read the Amazon description and thought the struggle of 2 teens relationship to be gay and happy in a small town would be interesting. Wrong.I watched the film wanting to turn it off so many times because the story line was extremely boring but I was waiting for a gay teen to appear. The movie is about 2 straight teens. I was very dissapointed but so frustrated that the movie lacked any kind of intelligent writing or acting. The ending is quite laughable.This movie is as flat as the Texas landscape that they mention. I cannot find any redeeming quality to recommend this to anyone. I see the other reviewers gave this movie 5 stars and I wonder if they saw the same movie I did. I would actually give it -2 stars for wasting my time and money.,1,Hallmark-Type Boring Straight Movie of the Week,1247702400,"07 16, 2009",2009,907,"['was', 'looking', 'gay', 'films', 'when', 'movie', 'appeared', 'along', 'other', 'gay', 'movies', 'suggested', 'film', 'interest', 'Naturally', 'thinking', 'was', 'gay', 'film', 'read', 'Amazon', 'description', 'thought', 'struggle', '2', 'teens', 'relationship', 'be', 'gay', 'happy', 'small', 'town', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'Wrong.I', 'watched', 'film', 'wanting', 'turn', 'off', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'extremely', 'boring', 'was', 'waiting', 'gay', 'teen', 'appear', 'movie', '2', 'straight', 'teens', 'was', 'very', 'dissapointed', 'so', 'frustrated', 'movie', 'lacked', 'kind', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'acting', 'ending', 'quite', 'laughable.This', 'movie', 'as', 'flat', 'Texas', 'landscape', 'mention', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'see', 'other', 'reviewers', 'gave', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'wonder', 'saw', 'same', 'movie', 'did', 'would', 'actually', 'give', '-2', 'wasting', 'time', 'money']",What Matters Most

They both loved status and prestige and didn't care about their son's opinions.  The daughter was given too muchattention and the father gave her the love rather than the son.The abuse by the father to the son was inexcusable.
