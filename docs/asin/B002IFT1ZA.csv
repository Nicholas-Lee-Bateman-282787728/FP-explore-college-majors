The soap opera is alive and well.I've never read a single word from the Martin books but darn it if I'm not packed and ready to move to Westeros.  There's seemingly naked ladies on every street corner and ten blood feuds for every man, woman and child.  Despite it's crass manor, Game of Thrones is the house guest you will likely never ask to leave.  Every week you are treated to an orgy - literally - of drinking, whoring, double-crossing, incest, murder and even the occasional magic among other skullduggery.  Tyrion has got to be the baddest dude since Omar walking the streets in a trench coat.I'm not sure how this all plays in the books, but it makes excellent television.  Game of Thrones is essentially everything missing from almost every other tv show I've seen.  Ever.  Thanks to the wealth of literature to draw from, Game of Thrones is the show every other show wants to be.  LOST wanted to be this show.  Sopranos wanted to be this show.  ROME tried like hell to be this show.  But Game of Thrones succeeds in actually presenting a solid, thoughtful, satisfying and logical story from beginning to end.  There are few random machinations of plot or characterization that do not propel the audience forward.  A ten episode season of Game of Thrones is better than 20 of most other tv shows.  It's not since BBC's Sherlock has a show made an art out of brevity.  There are more than likely throngs of book fans clamoring for clarity when such a large volume is compressed so much, but it's all the better for the tv viewer.  If I wanted everything the book offered - I'd just read the book.Season two is turning out to be a notch or two below the first season, but it was a hard act to follow after all.  Even on it's own as a standalone story - fiery cliffhanger and all - season 1 is a heck of a ride.  Seriously, stop the story right there in the sand with Daenerys and you can infer quite a bit.  Game of Thrones is preachy, over-sexed, bloody and at times, downright esoteric.  But boring?  No.  It took me two full seasons watching episodes multiple times to figure out most of who belongs to what family and all that but it never really mattered.  Dothrakis throw a mean wedding party. A Lannister always pays his debts.  A Stark is always honorable.

1269551,AHNYRCBNPYS9P,B002IFT1ZA,AeroEngineer,"[2, 3]","This show is really great. I thought it was a historical medieval show when I first turned it on but I find it's much better than that. Kinda like animated series are great because the medium gives them unlimited possibilities but they can still utilize real world characterizations and stories as well. I have watched and re-watched this show and other great HBO/Premium cable shows as opposed to the disposable broadcast/basic cable shows so it's actually a lasting investment.You quickly care about most of the characters, even the bad ones, due to the great story telling that hasn't gotten dull even after 2 seasons. I like season 1 better than 2 because it is more clear cut with a clear climax and ties up more loose ends than 2 did. The locations are amazing and varied, my favorite being the Eyrie castle in the sky.The plot is more believable than the majority of ""real"" series on TV which have so many silly events and circumstances it's sickening(sons of anarchy, hell on wheels,etc.). This is not a soap opera like many other shows are as well. There is never any unnecessary emotional pandering or ""music video"" montages, annoying product placement, etc.The clever plots are wonderful to see and were clearly thought through beforehand by a thoughtful, intelligent writer and production team. A lot of this is why HBO/premium channel and other subscriber based, as opposed to advertiser based, shows are the best. I think they are even better than 99% of movies.Another great thing is that if you don't want to wait for the show you can read the great book series which I'm doing now. The books are of course much deeper and fill in a lot of the missing pieces at least for me. The show illustrates a version of the events and for me gives appropriate faces(if not all accurate to the books) to the characters as well as voices. I see the TV production and the books as one entity that gives you the full experience, especially since the author of the books is actively writing for the show but the books were done years before the show so they were not just some typical hollywood screenwriter trying to make a buck by writing what the studio bigwigs THINK/DEMAND is a salable product.RECOMMENDED!",5,"Loved it, Great Story and Action, Watched over and over, The books are great too!",1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,2212,"['show', 'really', 'great', 'thought', 'was', 'historical', 'medieval', 'show', 'when', 'first', 'turned', 'find', 'much', 'better', 'Kinda', 'animated', 'series', 'are', 'great', 'medium', 'unlimited', 'possibilities', 'can', 'still', 'utilize', 'real', 'world', 'characterizations', 'stories', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'watched', 're-watched', 'show', 'other', 'great', 'HBO/Premium', 'cable', 'shows', 'opposed', 'disposable', 'broadcast/basic', 'cable', 'shows', 'actually', 'lasting', 'investment.You', 'quickly', 'care', 'most', 'characters', 'even', 'bad', 'ones', 'due', 'great', 'story', 'telling', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'dull', 'even', '2', 'seasons', 'season', '1', 'better', '2', 'more', 'clear', 'cut', 'clear', 'climax', 'up', 'more', 'loose', 'ends', '2', 'did', 'locations', 'are', 'amazing', 'varied', 'favorite', 'being', 'Eyrie', 'castle', 'sky.The', 'plot', 'more', 'believable', 'majority', 'real', 'series', 'TV', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'silly', 'events', 'circumstances', 'sickening', 'sons', 'anarchy', 'hell', 'wheels', 'etc.', 'not', 'soap', 'opera', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'are', 'as', 'well', 'never', 'unnecessary', 'emotional', 'pandering', 'music', 'video', 'montages', 'annoying', 'product', 'placement', 'etc.The', 'clever', 'plots', 'are', 'wonderful', 'see', 'were', 'clearly', 'thought', 'beforehand', 'thoughtful', 'intelligent', 'writer', 'production', 'team', 'lot', 'why', 'HBO/premium', 'channel', 'other', 'subscriber', 'based', 'opposed', 'advertiser', 'based', 'shows', 'are', 'best', 'think', 'are', 'even', 'better', '99', '%', 'movies.Another', 'great', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'wait', 'show', 'can', 'read', 'great', 'book', 'series', ""'m"", 'doing', 'now', 'books', 'are', 'course', 'much', 'deeper', 'fill', 'lot', 'missing', 'pieces', 'least', 'show', 'version', 'events', 'appropriate', 'not', 'accurate', 'books', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'voices', 'see', 'TV', 'production', 'books', 'one', 'entity', 'full', 'experience', 'especially', 'author', 'books', 'actively', 'writing', 'show', 'books', 'were', 'done', 'years', 'show', 'were', 'not', 'just', 'typical', 'hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'trying', 'make', 'buck', 'writing', 'what', 'studio', 'bigwigs', 'THINK/DEMAND', 'salable', 'product.RECOMMENDED']",N/A

The Game of Thrones.story, for those of you who haven't read it, takes place long ago when the death of an important advisor to the king has died, setting into a series of events that will draw the 7 kingdoms of Westeros into chaos with intrigue.  Sean Bean plays Eddard Stark, the warden of he north, a noble man who is called into service for his king, a boyhood friend.  Without giving too much away, he resulting series of events sweeps every character in this incredible story not a whirlwind of betrayal and murder, leading eventually to war ( which is next season).The best way to describe the (very) sweeping epic Game of Thrones is like Lord of the Rings, only with more violence and more sex.  It is a very adult story without the usual stereotypes and plot contrivances of normal fantasy stories.  The genius of the story, other than it's sweep, is how the author, George RR Martin, keeps you on edge.  Do not get to attached to any character as he has no problem killing off even major characters.  This being HBO and a miniseries, none of the subtext is left out.  This is NOT a story for children or those with delicate sensibilities.  It is often shocking, brutal, violent, very sexual and yet thrilling and sensational.

""Tell me, what is it you plan to do wi...","[2, 3]","This first episode of the Game of Thrones brings together a marvelous cast and pulls tidbits from multiple iconographic fantasy genere books in the canon.  I have not read the books so I cannot comment as to the accuracy of the show based upon the books.I will say it only took me a few moments to get sucked into this multi-layered and complex plot- and this is only the first episode.  It was very entertaining and what I would call 'smart'.  This is not Tolkien, this is not Dungeons and Dragons rip-off.  There are references that some who know Tolkien or played D&D; will get(according to my husband) but as someone who is not highly versed in the fantasy genre of the like, I did not feel I was on the outside looking in.  Essentially, you might appreciate some of the borrowed references but if you don't you will still find this excellent entertainment.Being an HBO production, if you do not like nudity or crude humor, swear words, etc. you may wish to take a pass on this.  Those are not my favorite elements but they do add a sort of dark realism to something that could be quite pithy in the wrong hands.The feel of this first episode is dark with the repetition of the foreshadowing: ""Winter is coming"".  We are introduced to numerous characters and it takes a bit to sort it out but I've gotten it pretty well figured after watching the second episode.There is a great deal of symbolism and foreshadowing in this episode and those to come which is why I think it is so brilliant.  They are subtle in many ways and parts call to mind King Lear.  You can tell the production of this series is quite epic, not unlike the story itself-  they have taken their time in creating real, believable characters in a dark times swirled together with elements of fantasy and mythology.I can't wait to watch the entire series.  Again, this is not for children (there are some brutally violent scenes, language and nudity) and, for me, the creators have made suspension of reality a little too easy when watching).  I was completely immersed.  I am also looking forward to reading the books.I agree with previous reviewers that this will become a classic tale of fantasy.

1269582,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B002IFT1ZA,Andres C. Salama,"[4, 14]","This HBO series, somewhat reminiscent of The Lords of the Ring in plot and style, is based on the popular medieval fantasy books by George Martin (not the Beatles producer), The first season is basically about the struggle for power in the mythical Seven Kingdoms between two families, the evil Lannisters headed by the wife of the King, Queen Cersei (a fine performance by Lena Headey) and the more honorable Starks, who rule in the north of the realm, led by Ned Stark (a good turn as well by Sean Bean). There is a third dynasty as well, the Targaryen, related to the previous, murdered king, whose two survivors are the evil, bleach blond Viserys (a magnetic Harry Lloyd) and his beautiful, ethereal sister Daenerys (the petite Emilia Clarke, a revelation in a stunning performance). They live in exile among the savage Dothraki, a race of brutal, nomadic horse riders, and Viserys hopes that the marriage of Daenerys with their leader Khal Drogo will help him raise an army of Dothraki to invade the Seven Kingdoms, overthrow the king and put him in charge of the realm.The series benefits from some great performances. Besides those I just mentioned, I have to add Peter Dinklage as the sardonic dwarf Tyrion Lannister, brother to the queen, and Jack Gleeson as the insufferable, cruel child heir to the throne, Joffrey. Not all performances in the series are remarkable, though: most of the Starks, especially Ned's sons, fail to make much of an impression.The series has a very good start, then somewhat loses steam in the middle episodes, but rises again in the last two chapters for a rousing finale. I quite enjoyed the series, but I cannot call it a masterpiece. One problem that the many characters and the various, convoluted plots make it confusing at times. Some plot threads, especially the one in the frontier, could have been excised completely and the series would not have suffered. The stunning photography and locations certainly helps.",4,"Great entertainment, though it falls just short of being a masterpiece",1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,1959,"['HBO', 'series', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'Lords', 'Ring', 'plot', 'style', 'based', 'popular', 'medieval', 'fantasy', 'books', 'George', 'Martin', 'not', 'Beatles', 'producer', 'first', 'season', 'basically', 'struggle', 'power', 'mythical', 'Seven', 'Kingdoms', 'two', 'families', 'evil', 'Lannisters', 'headed', 'wife', 'King', 'Queen', 'Cersei', 'fine', 'performance', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'more', 'honorable', 'Starks', 'who', 'rule', 'north', 'realm', 'led', 'Ned', 'Stark', 'good', 'turn', 'as', 'well', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'third', 'dynasty', 'well', 'Targaryen', 'related', 'previous', 'murdered', 'king', 'two', 'survivors', 'are', 'evil', 'bleach', 'blond', 'Viserys', 'magnetic', 'Harry', 'Lloyd', 'beautiful', 'ethereal', 'sister', 'Daenerys', 'petite', 'Emilia', 'Clarke', 'revelation', 'stunning', 'performance', 'live', 'exile', 'savage', 'Dothraki', 'race', 'brutal', 'nomadic', 'horse', 'riders', 'Viserys', 'marriage', 'Daenerys', 'leader', 'Khal', 'Drogo', 'will', 'help', 'raise', 'army', 'Dothraki', 'invade', 'Seven', 'Kingdoms', 'overthrow', 'king', 'put', 'charge', 'realm.The', 'series', 'benefits', 'great', 'performances', 'just', 'mentioned', 'have', 'add', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'sardonic', 'dwarf', 'Tyrion', 'Lannister', 'brother', 'queen', 'Jack', 'Gleeson', 'insufferable', 'cruel', 'child', 'heir', 'throne', 'Joffrey', 'Not', 'performances', 'series', 'are', 'remarkable', 'most', 'Starks', 'especially', 'Ned', 'sons', 'fail', 'make', 'much', 'impression.The', 'series', 'very', 'good', 'start', 'then', 'somewhat', 'steam', 'middle', 'episodes', 'again', 'last', 'two', 'chapters', 'rousing', 'finale', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'can', 'not', 'call', 'masterpiece', 'One', 'problem', 'many', 'characters', 'various', 'convoluted', 'plots', 'make', 'confusing', 'times', 'plot', 'threads', 'especially', 'one', 'frontier', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excised', 'completely', 'series', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'suffered', 'stunning', 'photography', 'locations', 'certainly']",N/A

I disagree. There is a good &#34;story&#34; here. A story that deals with honor and familial bond and vengeance and the cost of revenge, not only within a family, but to an entire realm. This &#34;story&#34; also explores what it means to be &#34;high born&#34; or &#34;low born.&#34; How luck plays a part in life's trials and tribulations. How youth can be foolish and brash. How oldsters can hold on to grudges that destroy lives for generations. I agree that in the series there's a lot of gratuitous nudity, particularly of young women. If it wasn't gratuitous we'd see more male nudity, more nude old men and women, nude fat people, etc. I was disturbed by the casual references to the use of young boys, and other perversions like incest. But the truth is the royal families of Europe historically participated in all sorts of debauchery, and sexual lechery; as did (and does) the Catholic church with all it's pedophile priests. So there's plenty of pure story here. So much so, you could delete the scenes of violence and sex and still enjoy this series.

One star might be a bit harsh, but I have to counterbalance all of the ridiculously high 5-star ratings this show has received.  Seriously, there's nothing amazing about it.  Sure, the scale of it is grand, but the pace moves like a snail throughout most of it.  In fact, the first 4-5 episodes are a total bore.  There are endless conversations that serve no purpose, as well as many controversial elements that seem to exist for no other reason than shock value or titilation: full-frontal nudity, incest, gay sex, lesbian sex, even kids killing kids.  And the graphic, gorey deaths are not limited to just humans: there are plenty of animals slaughtered in bloody detail.  I'm not offended by any of it, although I could do without the onscreen violence toward animals.  I didn't mind similar elements in HBO's series ""Rome"" because they seemed to support the story more or could be supported by history.

1269599,A24IZL1YQF0YBJ,B002IFT1ZA,"Art Scott ""Statsmonster""","[0, 0]","This series, based on Martin's &#34;A Song of Fire and Ice&#34; double trilogy, is unparalleled in just about every category one would look for in a show.  Be it the writing, directing, casting, acting, wardrobe, or set production, you won't be let down.  In fact, not only won't you be let down, but you're in for a visual treat, and one that grips you emotionally.  You'll laugh, cry, and in every way blown away by how well the show is put together.Very basically, the show is about the King's throne, and who will out maneuver whom to get their family, or someone in their family to the top, to be King. You'll watch with rapt attention how the choices each of the 10 or so major characters affect the rest of the world.  Peter Linklage absolutely dominates his role as &#34;the Imp&#34;--the youngest son of the richest family in what they refer to as &#34;the 7 Kingdoms,&#34; and just dares you to root against him as he is the dwarf son of the patriarch of the Lannister family.As amazingly acted as this show is, it's hard to find even a single flaw in the entire show.  If the show has any weaknesses, it would be in trying to pass 20 something year old actors as 14 and 15 year olds, and, if you want to call it a weakness, there are only 10 shows per season and as the show keeps delivering one of the most epic, addictive performances, I've found it hard, personally, not to watch the 20+ episodes which have been made because you'll always be yearning for more.For the parents, I would strongly suggest you watch an episode before allowing anyone under the age of 13 from watching as you might find yourself forced into having &#34;the talk&#34; with them long before you want to. When they warn you about the sex, nudity, and violence, they're not kidding.  There's plenty of each, however none are used gratuitously.  They're used as needed to show the character of each, well, each character.So, pros would be: Acting, Directing, Production, Writing, Costuming/Wardrobe, make-up, special effects.The negatives would be: only 10 shows a season, only available through either pay-cable, or pay-amazon, though quite honestly, it's worth every penny, and, for those who've read the books, the age-inappropriate casting.  Since the very first episode I was highly dubious when I saw 2 characters who, in the books, are only 14 and 15, but both arrive sporting beards any 30 year old would envy, and a girl who's supposed to be 12 looking closer to 20 than 12.  With that being its worst flaw (and quite explicable by saying, quite simply, the show was never meant to be exactly the same as the books.  Those who haven't read the books won't even notice it), again, it's a show without equal.To sum up, it's as I said in the title.  In my opinion, to date, this is the very best show ever made for the small screen.  The scope of the story, and the glorious visuals just beg you to watch the show with a projector so you can watch it on a 120&#34; screen.  The producers spared no expense in making this show everything it could be.  Other than giving us 20 hours of viewing per season instead of 10, I'm not altogether certain there's anything which could've been done better.",5,"Not just the best SciFi/Fantasy show ever made, but perhaps the best show ever made in ANY genre",1365120000,"04 5, 2013",2013,3188,"['series', 'based', 'Martin', '34', 'A', 'Song', 'Fire', 'Ice', '34', 'double', 'trilogy', 'unparalleled', 'just', 'category', 'one', 'would', 'look', 'show', 'Be', 'writing', 'directing', 'casting', 'acting', 'wardrobe', 'set', 'production', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'let', 'down', 'fact', 'not', 'only', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'let', 'down', ""'re"", 'visual', 'treat', 'one', 'emotionally', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'cry', 'way', 'blown', 'away', 'how', 'well', 'show', 'put', 'together.Very', 'basically', 'show', 'King', 'throne', 'who', 'will', 'out', 'maneuver', 'whom', 'get', 'family', 'someone', 'family', 'top', 'be', 'King', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'rapt', 'attention', 'how', 'choices', '10', 'so', 'major', 'characters', 'affect', 'rest', 'world', 'Peter', 'Linklage', 'absolutely', 'role', '34', 'Imp', '34', 'youngest', 'son', 'richest', 'family', 'what', 'refer', '34', '7', 'Kingdoms', '34', 'just', 'dares', 'root', 'dwarf', 'son', 'patriarch', 'Lannister', 'family.As', 'amazingly', 'acted', 'show', 'hard', 'find', 'even', 'single', 'flaw', 'entire', 'show', 'show', 'weaknesses', 'would', 'be', 'trying', 'pass', '20', 'something', 'year', 'old', 'actors', '14', '15', 'year', 'olds', 'want', 'call', 'weakness', 'are', 'only', '10', 'shows', 'season', 'show', 'delivering', 'one', 'most', 'epic', 'addictive', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'found', 'hard', 'personally', 'not', 'watch', '20+', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'made', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'yearning', 'more.For', 'parents', 'would', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'watch', 'episode', 'allowing', 'anyone', 'age', '13', 'watching', 'might', 'find', 'forced', 'having', '34', 'talk', '34', 'long', 'want', 'When', 'warn', 'sex', 'nudity', 'violence', ""'re"", 'not', 'kidding', 'plenty', 'however', 'none', 'are', 'used', 'gratuitously', ""'re"", 'used', 'needed', 'show', 'character', 'well', 'character.So', 'pros', 'would', 'be', 'Acting', 'Directing', 'Production', 'Writing', 'Costuming/Wardrobe', 'make-up', 'special', 'effects.The', 'negatives', 'would', 'be', 'only', '10', 'shows', 'season', 'only', 'available', 'pay-cable', 'pay-amazon', 'quite', 'honestly', 'worth', 'penny', 'who', ""'ve"", 'read', 'books', 'age-inappropriate', 'casting', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'highly', 'dubious', 'when', 'saw', '2', 'characters', 'who', 'books', 'are', 'only', '14', '15', 'arrive', 'sporting', 'beards', '30', 'year', 'old', 'would', 'envy', 'girl', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', '12', 'looking', 'closer', '20', '12', 'being', 'worst', 'flaw', 'quite', 'explicable', 'saying', 'quite', 'simply', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'exactly', 'same', 'books', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'again', 'show', 'equal.To', 'sum', 'up', 'said', 'title', 'opinion', 'date', 'very', 'best', 'show', 'ever', 'made', 'small', 'screen', 'scope', 'story', 'glorious', 'visuals', 'just', 'beg', 'watch', 'show', 'projector', 'can', 'watch', '120', '34', 'screen', 'producers', 'spared', 'expense', 'making', 'show', 'everything', 'could', 'be', 'Other', 'giving', '20', 'hours', 'viewing', 'season', 'instead', '10', ""'m"", 'not', 'altogether', 'certain', 'anything', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'better']",N/A

1269607,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B002IFT1ZA,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[6, 9]","George R.R. Martin's A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is the most critically-acclaimed work of epic fantasy since THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Over the course of five very large books, it has amassed a large, international fan following. With its adult content, mature themes and focus on well-motivated characters, only HBO was capable of bringing the project to the screen, and fans were delighted when it was announced that they would indeed be handling this adaptation.GAME OF THRONES has to work on two levels: to satisfy the existing fans of the books and also to rope in many new readers unfamiliar with the novels. Broadly speaking, it succeeds. The budget is huge but not infinite and there have been compromises over cost. Most notably, armies rarely feel like they consist of more than 20 people and the direwolves do more closely resemble big dogs than ferocious animals from myth. But on almost every other level the show is a huge success.The casting is almost flawless. Sean Bean brings his world-weary, craggy looks to the role of Eddard Stark and effectively plays him as an older warrior haunted by the decisions of his past. Mark Addy may only be a fraction of the size of Robert Baratheon from the books, but this is forgotten as he nails Robert's ferocious attitude, mixed with a love of wine and women but an unhealthy obssession with the past (which takes the phrase 'rose-tinted spectacles' to a new level). Nikolaj Coster-Waldau nails Jaime's arrogance, whilst Maisie Williams, Isaac Hempstead Wright and Sophie Turner play their roles as the Stark children to perfection. Jack Gleeson sells Joffrey's cruel brutality with aplomb, whilst Conleth Hill is Varys from the books, simply stepped onto the screen and played with total conviction. Likewise superb is Iain Glen as Jorah Mormont, who provides able support to newcomer Emilia Clarke as Daenerys. Clarke has arguably the toughest role of the cast, moving from scared young girl to confident ruler, but manages the task ably. Jason Momoa has little to do as taciturn warlord Khal Drogo, but comes to life in two highly memorable scenes later in the season, whilst Harry Lloyd brings the requisite amount of demented charm to the role of Viserys (one of the few characters much-improved in the transition from book to screen).Michelle Fairley, Lena Headey and Aidan Gillen are also effective as their characters of Catelyn Stark, Cersei Lannister and Littlefinger, but these roles are the ones most notably changed from the book. Catelyn is more predictably reactive than in the books, whilst Cersei has been softened somewhat. More controversial are the changes to Littlefinger, reduced from the master schemer and conniver of the books to a shifty brothel-owner who inexplicably entrusts his motivations to prostitutes he's just met. Gillen does good work in the role, but the Littlefinger of the TV series is a shadow of that in the books.Do we need to say anything of Peter Dinklage as Tyrion save that he is absolutely brilliant? True, he sometimes struggles with the accent, but after a while it ceases to matter (and Tyrion over-enunciating himself to make sure everyone knows he's a noble is something that the character would do) and his Emmy/Golden Globe-winning performance is riveting throughout. His acting partners - Jerome Flynn as Bronn and, in the last two episodes, Sibel Kekilli as Shae - provide able support in his storyline. And of course Charles Dance is just perfect as Tywin Lannister, taking method to a new level when he guts a real (dead) stag live on screen whilst delivering a monologue about his house's power. Kit Harington also makes for an effective Jon Snow, with the other members of the Night's Watch also portrayed with skill (a special mention for Owen Teale as Alliser Thorne, who is much less of a two-dimensional villain than in the books and on-screen becomes someone who, whilst antagonistic, neverthless has a plausible motivation).The writing is, for the most part, decent. Many scenes from the book are translated to the screen with vigour and skill. There are also several new scenes, such as a revelatory conversation between Robert and Cersei, which adds more depth to the story. The biggest issue is with the sex and nudity in the series. Not that it's there - this is a HBO show after all and the books are hardly lacking in it - but that it is often used as a crutch to support scenes of exposition and that it is frequently badly-written. The worst scene of the season is the aforementioned 'Littlefinger explains his character backstory to some random prostitutes' scene, which is cringe-inducing (despite Gillen and Esme Bianco's attempts to sell the dialogue). Whilst these scenes are relatively rare, they do slow the narrative and take time away from more compelling matters elsewhere.Elsewhere, the effects are solid, the (Emmy Award-winning) opening title sequence is amazing and the musical score highly effective.The Blu-Ray presentation is also second to none. The picture quality is crisp and shows off the superb set design and excellent cinematography. The special features are stunning, with particular praise reserved for the in-universe documentaries about the Great Houses (voiced by the castmembers). The episode commentaries are also enjoyable, though not as packed with information as might be wished.Overall, this is a superior season of television, although not quite up there with HBO's best. As (disclosure) the creator of the GAME OF THRONES Wiki and a moderator on Westeros.org I was predisposed to enjoy the series anyway, but in some areas HBO exceeded all my expectations. The weaker elements - the more pointless scenes of sexposition and the entire absence of the powerful flashback scenes, such as the tower of joy sequence (probably the best scene in the book) - are regrettable but, so far, minor.",4,"Despite some minor issues, a strong season of television",1335657600,"04 29, 2012",2012,5848,"['George', 'R.R', 'Martin', 'A', 'SONG', 'OF', 'ICE', 'AND', 'FIRE',

1269615,A1VBMM3SCBOA9M,B002IFT1ZA,B. Cooper,"[3, 4]","I heard the reviews for Game of Thrones, yet originally dismissed the miniseries based upon several misconceptions.  True, this is not overtly centered around fantasy elements despite being part of the genre; and yes, there is an abundance of political drama.  However,  HBO and George R.R. Martin have succeeded in creating some of the most riveting characters and suspenseful narration ever witnessed in film.  If you have even a remote interest in dark fantasy, Game of Thrones is the best miniseries ever created.Acting is phenomenal across the board. Recognizable actors/actresses and newcomers alike never miss their mark.  From children to adults, not a single line is delivered without conviction.  The intensity with which you will come to love, or loathe each character is testament to the writing and skillful acting that brings each character to life.  Brace yourself for a rollercoaster of emotions.This is truly an adult series, and if you shy away from extreme violence or blunt sexuality and nudity - you will not enjoy Game of Thrones.  Yet for those who are not put off, I can say that nothing feels forced.  Instead, it feels like a much grittier, natural depiction of the time period and setting.I will not delve into specific episodes, because I honestly enjoyed each of the (10) 50-54 min long episodes equally.  However, there is something to be said about a 10 hour miniseries that is consistent throughout.  In fact, it was difficult to watch less than 3-4 episodes at a time.  Witnessing several stories unravel at once akin to Lord of the Rings was deeply engaging.  George R.R. Martin stated in several interviews he was influenced by J.R.R Tolkien and H.P. Lovecraft, and it shows.  The ghastly White Walkers invoke an almost preternatural fear from their domain behind the Wall, and the characters and backstories are dynamic and unique.Regarding bluray player playback - I also own an Oppo BDP-83, which a few reviewers claim has issues playing the bluray version of Game of Thrones.  I did have to shut off the system and turn it back on several times.  However, once it registered the disc I only had to wait about 15 sec.  Such a minor inconvenience is not even noteworthy considering how revolutionary this series is, and how FANTASTIC it looks and sounds on bluray.  This is nothing new either.  As bluray discs are compressed more, it is inevitable that the players will need additional software updates.  You can't blame HBO for releasing the bluray with better visual and sound quality.George R.R. Martin has said there will be 7 books in the series, and is currently writing the 6th.  I can say, without a doubt, that if HBO continues to live up to its own standards - this will be a collection for the ages.  More than Harry Potter, or any other series - I will look forward to the next installment.Game of Thrones should be placed next to the word EPIC in the dictionary. These four letters can sum up my entire review.HBO, thank you.",5,BELIEVE the Reviews.

Marold""","[0, 0]","Update: If you did not see the series on HBO, I strongly recommend getting the DVDs for the season rather than watching them on line from Amazon or Netflix. I watched the first season and there was so much I missed because I did not have a firm grasp on the relations between the characters. All the little family trees helped, but not much. I watched the complete first season over again, and it made far more sense. I did not attend to the ""extras"" in the review. I suggest they are ""fair to good"". There is a voice-over commentary for almost all episodes, except that the quality is uneven. If the writer(s), director, or producer are commenting, the value is very good. If, as in the second episode, the commentary is by three child actors, the commentary is almost worthless, unless you have an adolescent in your audience.Given all the other reviews, it is hard for me to think of anything new to say about this celebrated HBO series which as some strong similarities to the 2 season historical drama ""Rome"". It seems the writer has ""borrowed"" a bit from just about everyone, most heavily relying on the real history of the Plantagenets and the War of the Roses, although there is little evidence that the dialogue owes anything to Shakespeare's great plays about that history. Of course, there is also a strong flavoring of Tolkien, as if you needed Sean Bean (Boromir in LOTR) in the lead role of Ned Stark to tell you that.When I began watching, I had high expectations, which were temporarily deflated through the third to about the seventh episode. I yearned for more back story, which the narrative gave out in drips and drabs. I anticipated that the king would die in some way during the first season, and the fact that Sean Bean does not reappear in season 2 give away some of the plot.Another element which enlivened my interest is that Peter Dinklage's character, Tyrian Lannister, begins to appear more regularly by episode 7, and starts having an active effect on events. Even in this season, there is no mystery to why Dinklage got several acting awards for his role in this series. Aside from Bean and Dinklage, the acting is sound, if not necessarily inspired. If I were to identify one actor and role I began to anticipate, it was Emilia Clarke, who plays the exiled Daenerys Targaryen.The season succeeded in what may have been its two primary objectives. I am now anxious to see what happens in Season 2 (especially to see more of Dinklage) and to buy some of the books by George R. R. Martin, on which the series is based. It is this deep history which made Tolkien's books so magical and which works for Martin's story as well.",5,"Another pseudo-Medieval story, with a strong pull",1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,2653,"['Update', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'series', 'HBO', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'getting', 'DVDs', 'season', 'rather', 'watching', 'line', 'Amazon', 'Netflix', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'missed', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'firm', 'grasp', 'relations', 'characters', 'little', 'family', 'trees', 'helped', 'not', 'much', 'watched', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'over', 'again', 'made', 'far', 'more', 'sense', 'did', 'not', 'attend', 'extras', 'review', 'suggest', 'are', 'fair', 'good', 'voice-over', 'commentary', 'almost', 'episodes', 'quality', 'uneven', 'writer', 's', 'director', 'producer', 'are', 'commenting', 'value', 'very', 'good', 'second', 'episode', 'commentary', 'three', 'child', 'actors', 'commentary', 'almost', 'worthless', 'have', 'adolescent', 'audience.Given', 'other', 'reviews', 'hard', 'think', 'anything', 'new', 'say', 'celebrated', 'HBO', 'series', 'strong', 'similarities', '2', 'season', 'historical', 'drama', 'Rome', 'writer', 'borrowed', 'bit', 'just', 'everyone', 'most', 'heavily', 'relying', 'real', 'history', 'Plantagenets', 'War', 'Roses', 'little', 'evidence', 'dialogue', 'anything', 'Shakespeare', 'great', 'plays', 'history', 'course', 'also', 'strong', 'flavoring', 'Tolkien', 'needed', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Boromir', 'LOTR', 'lead', 'role', 'Ned', 'Stark', 'tell', 'that.When', 'began', 'watching', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'were', 'temporarily', 'deflated', 'third', 'seventh', 'episode', 'yearned', 'more', 'back', 'story', 'narrative', 'gave', 'out', 'drips', 'drabs', 'anticipated', 'king', 'would', 'die', 'way', 'first', 'season', 'fact', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'not', 'reappear', 'season', '2', 'give', 'away', 'plot.Another', 'element', 'enlivened', 'interest', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'character', 'Tyrian', 'Lannister', 'appear', 'more', 'regularly', 'episode', '7', 'having', 'active', 'effect', 'events', 'Even', 'season', 'mystery', 'why', 'Dinklage', 'got', 'several', 'acting', 'awards', 'role', 'series', 'Bean', 'Dinklage', 'acting', 'sound', 'not', 'necessarily', 'inspired', 'were', 'identify', 'one', 'actor', 'role', 'began', 'anticipate', 'was', 'Emilia', 'Clarke', 'who', 'exiled', 'Daenerys', 'Targaryen.The', 'season', 'succeeded', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'primary', 'objectives', 'am', 'now', 'anxious', 'see', 'what', 'Season', '2', 'especially', 'see', 'more', 'Dinklage', 'buy', 'books', 'George', 'R.', 'R.', 'Martin', 'series', 'based', 'deep', 'history', 'made', 'Tolkien', 'books', 'so', 'magical', 'Martin', 'story', 'as', 'well']",N/A

The series stayed pleasingly close to the books and when it deviated it usually did so by omission of detail and not by making up new material (I hated that in the LOTR movies).A lot of people seem to complain about the gratuitous sex scenes, it's a sign of our askew view that apparently a naked breast or penis offends people whereas a full frontal beheading appears to be fine. I never got that, why is sex worse then violence? Well there is plenty of both in this series (books and show) and that's just fine with me.Where in my opinion it falls a little short is scenes that show armies or mass events like drogos wedding. The problem is that in the books you read about 10000nds of participants whereas in the show you see a hundred at best in very carefully choreographed and narrow shots.

1269638,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B002IFT1ZA,Brian C.,"[0, 0]","I have recently watched the first seasons of two shows that I thought were really excellent. Both were way above what I have generally come to expect from television. The first was this show (Game of Thrones for those who have already forgotten what product page they are looking at) and the other wasJustified: The Complete First Season. I do not think that it is a coincidence that both were based on novels (Game of Thrones was, of course, based on the novels by George R.R. Martin, and Justified was based on novels by Elmore Leonard). I think that novelists often have more freedom than television writers. They can make their characters more ambiguous and interesting and they can make their story lines darker. They do not have to pander as much and as a result, shows that base themselves on novels, wind up being way more interesting as a general rule (there are exceptions).That is certainly true about this show. The show has a whole host of really interesting characters. Way too many to list. The web of characters is quite complex but they are all drawn so well, each character is so unique and distinctive, that the viewer never gets confused about who is who. The show also has a pretty dark story line. I will not give any specifics away for those who have not watched the first season yet but the show does not shy away from allowing good people to die. The politics of the show are complex. It is really an adult show. Not only due to its complexity but also because there is a lot of violence and nudity. I applaud HBO for not ironing out all the complexity, or removing all the violence and nudity, in order to appeal to the widest possible audience.The complexity is really part of what makes this such an engaging show. There are so many characters, and the show shifts between story lines, and it always leaves each story line at a critical moment so that the audience is dying to get back to that story line. Sometimes when a show, or a movie, has multiple story lines going at once, some of the story lines wind up being way more interesting than others, and the viewer winds up feeling like they just have to get through one story line so that they can get back to the more interesting story lines. This show manages to produce multiple story lines (Robb Stark, Arya Stark, Sansa Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Daenarys Targaryen all have their own story lines) and they are all equally interesting and engaging. I have never seen a show that I thought was as successful in weaving various story lines together. That is part of what makes the show so addictive. Even when you are watching Daenerys' story line, or Arya's story line, you are eager to get back to Jon Snow's story line, or Tyrion's story line, etc.. It really is a fantastic achievement.I have not actually read the Martin books this show is based on but it is clear to me that Martin was successful in creating a really interesting and believable alternate world which this show brings to life. Watching the show is an immersive experience not unlike reading the Lord of the Rings. I doubt that any fantasy writer will ever be as successful as J.R.R. Tolkien in creating an alternate world but Martin deserves praise for what he has accomplished with Game of Thrones. It is the details that really make it feel like a genuine world. For example, the Northern wall, the new and old gods, the fact that Winter comes rarely and at unpredictable times, the various cultures, the death of the dragons, etc.. There is an entire mythology operating in all of those details. I am actually not a huge fantasy enthusiast. I have read very few fantasy novels, but I understand the appeal of escaping to another world, and this show allows the viewer to escape into another world for an hour at a time (or more, if you are like me, and cannot stop at just one).There are two more things that the show does particularly well. First, it sets up some really evil villains. All of the Lannisters, with the possible exception of Tyrion, are genuinely detestable. They are villains that the viewer loves to hate and the hope that they will eventually get their comeuppance is more than enough to keep the viewer watching. Second, the show sets up some really interesting mysteries. What is happening north of the wall? Are we going to see the White Walkers? Are the dragons going to return? I love it when shows set up mysteries like that. I don't think I have ever watched a show that has been as successful as this one at creating a sense of unrequited anticipation in me. I am dying to see the White Walkers. The fact that we just hear stories about the White Walkers, without seeing them (at least in the first season) was genius. However interesting the White Walkers wind up being if, and when, we see them, seeing them cannot compete with the mystery (What are they?).The show is extremely addictive. I have to be careful starting an episode because I can never stop after just one. Or two. Or three (let's be honest). This is certainly one the most interesting, and well written, shows I have ever seen. Here is my advice to television studios: make more show adaptations of novels. You already have a solid set of characters to start with, and a story, and the show is almost guaranteed to be edgier and more interesting than anything that was developed for television (there are, of course, exceptions, like Breaking Bad, which I have heard is quite good and edgy). The success of shows like Game of Thrones, Justified, and Dexter (which was also based on graphic novels) prove that audiences crave good writing, interesting characters, and dark story lines, and are willing to follow shows with some moral complexity and ambiguity. So that is my advice for television studios. Here is my advice for viewers: watch this show! (unless you hate good writing, or are too busy saving the world to be sucked into an alternate universe for a few hours at a time).",5,Ridiculously addictive...,1371859200,"06 22,

An epic, sprawling story full of memorable characters and sinister events, it quickly sweeps you up into its complicated world while reminding you that not all fantasy is as innocent as Narnia.White walkers have not been seen in centuries, but the Guardians of the Wall fear their return with the approaching winter. Summer has lasted for ten years and the cold is coming. But of more immediate concern is the news that the King's advisor has died, and he comes to Winterfell to invite Lord Stark (Sean Bean) the position, much to the concern of Lady Stark (Michelle Fairley), who fears her husband's absence will mean misfortune for them all. King Baratheon's presence in the northern kingdom brings unease when his wife Cersei (Lena Headey) is discovered by Lord Stark's son as having a ""special relationship"" with her twin brother Jamie (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). The boy is thrown from an upper window and the family is left to deal with the horrific consequences.Lord Stark's illegitimate son Jon (Kit Harrington) travels north to take the black cloth and become a Guardian of the Wall, and strikes up an unlikely friendship with Cersei's older brother, Tyrion (Peter Dinklage). Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, the official heir to the throne is seeking out means of reclaiming his kingdom. Viserys (Harry Lloyd) has arranged a marriage between his sister Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) to Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa), a chieftain lord who has promised to help him reclaim his throne. But as the two armies prepare for war and unravel a shocking plot of betrayal and murder, an ancient evil rises in the north...In purely cinematic terms, Game of Thrones is a masterpiece. It creates a fascinating and dangerous world in which an unforgettable cast of characters dwell. Some we love, and others we love to hate, but none of them leave us with a lack of emotion. The detail and setting is immaculate and the cast is incredibly strong, ranging from the big-screen names mentioned here to later appearances by such individuals as Aidan Gillen, whose character proves more interesting than most, the lynchpin that drives all, a clever man who is more than he seems (one early prophetic line of dialogue has him telling Lord Stark, ""not trusting me was the wisest thing you have done since you got off your horse"") and Charles Dance. But the tagline of this series is ""don't get too attached,"" and that proves true: in these stories, no one is safe and before the end, some of our favorite characters will die.Sean Bean is the main driving force of this first season, and arguably its strongest point. This is assisted by the fact that he is the ""leading character"" but it is hard not to come to love him for the smaller things, such as the pride he takes in watching his youngest daughter learn to handle a sword. He is also one of the few truly ""good"" men involved, since elsewhere we have fornicators, rapists, warlords, and pimps. Unfortunately, the fantastic storytelling comes with a heavy dose of violence, sex, and nudity, along with the not-so-occasional f-word. Sometimes, it is to further the plot, but most of the time it is simply there to be controversial. In certain ways, for me at least, it also diminished the overall experience.I cannot say that this series is enjoyable, because in many ways it is heart-wrenching, but it creates a unique world that I have never experienced before but am eager to experience again, and that in of itself is a remarkable accomplishment.",3,Brilliant But Problematic,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,3578,"['George', 'R.R', 'Martin', 'bloodthirsty', 'fantasy', 'novels', 'have', 'found', 'home', 'HBO', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'epic', 'sprawling', 'story', 'full', 'memorable', 'characters', 'sinister', 'events', 'quickly', 'up', 'complicated', 'world', 'reminding', 'not', 'fantasy', 'as', 'innocent', 'Narnia.White', 'walkers', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'seen', 'centuries', 'Guardians', 'Wall', 'fear', 'return', 'approaching', 'winter', 'Summer', 'lasted', 'ten', 'years', 'cold', 'coming', 'more', 'immediate', 'concern', 'news', 'King', 'advisor', 'died', 'Winterfell', 'invite', 'Lord', 'Stark', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'position', 'much', 'concern', 'Lady', 'Stark', 'Michelle', 'Fairley', 'who', 'husband', 'absence', 'will', 'mean', 'misfortune', 'King', 'Baratheon', 'presence', 'northern', 'kingdom', 'brings', 'unease', 'when', 'wife', 'Cersei', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'discovered', 'Lord', 'Stark', 'son', 'having', 'special', 'relationship', 'twin', 'brother', 'Jamie', 'Nikolaj', 'Coster-Waldau', 'boy', 'thrown', 'upper', 'window', 'family', 'left', 'deal', 'horrific', 'consequences.Lord', 'Stark', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'Jon', 'Kit', 'Harrington', 'north', 'take', 'black', 'cloth', 'become', 'Guardian', 'Wall', 'up', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'Cersei', 'older', 'brother', 'Tyrion', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'Meanwhile', 'Narrow', 'Sea', 'official', 'heir', 'throne', 'seeking', 'out', 'means', 'reclaiming', 'kingdom', 'Viserys', 'Harry', 'Lloyd', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'sister', 'Daenerys', 'Emilia', 'Clarke', 'Khal', 'Drogo', 'Jason', 'Momoa', 'chieftain', 'lord', 'who', 'promised', 'help', 'reclaim', 'throne', 'two', 'armies', 'prepare', 'war', 'unravel', 'shocking', 'plot', 'betrayal', 'murder', 'ancient', 'evil', 'north', 'purely', 'cinematic', 'terms', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'masterpiece', 'fascinating', 'dangerous', 'world', 'unforgettable', 'cast', 'characters', 'dwell', 'love', 'others', 'love', 'hate', 'none', 'leave', 'lack', 'emotion', 'detail', 'setting', 'immaculate', 'cast', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'ranging', 'big-screen', 'names', 'mentioned', 'here', 'later', 'appearances', 'such', 'individuals', 'Aidan', 'Gillen', 'character', 'more', 'interesting', 'most', 'lynchpin', 'clever', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'one', 'early', 'prophetic', 'line', 'dialogue', 'telling', 'Lord', 'Stark', 'not', 'trusting', 'was', 'wisest', 'thing', 'have', 'done', 'got', 'off', 'horse', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'tagline', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'attached', 'true', 'stories', 'one', 'safe', 'end', 'favorite', 'characters', 'will', 'die.Sean', 'Bean', 'main', 'driving', 'force', 'first', 'season', 'arguably', 'strongest', 'point', 'assisted', 'fact', 'leading', 'character', 'hard', 'not', 'come', 'love', 'smaller', 'things', 'such', 'pride', 'watching', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'learn', 'handle', 'sword', 'also', 'one', 'few', 'truly', 'good', 'men', 'involved', 'elsewhere', 'have', 'fornicators', 'rapists', 'warlords', 'pimps', 'Unfortunately', 'fantastic', 'storytelling', 'heavy', 'dose', 'violence', 'sex', 'nudity', 'not-so-occasional', 'f-word', 'Sometimes', 'further', 'plot', 'most', 'time', 'simply', 'be', 'controversial', 'certain', 'ways', 'least', 'also', 'diminished', 'overall', 'experience.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'series', 'enjoyable', 'many', 'ways', 'heart-wrenching', 'unique', 'world', 'have', 'never', 'experienced', 'am', 'eager', 'experience', 'again', 'remarkable', 'accomplishment']",N/A
1269660,A15V4JUD4ZDUX3,B002IFT1ZA,"Charles Stembridge ""Proteus""","[0, 0]","Storyline: Seven noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros. Political and sexual intrigue is pervasive. Robert Baratheon, King of Westeros, asks his old friend Eddard, Lord Stark, to serve as Hand of the King, or highest official. Secretly warned that the previous Hand was assassinated, Eddard accepts in order to investigate further. Meanwhile the Queen's family, the Lannisters, may be hatching a plot to take power. Across the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed ruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne. The friction between the houses Stark, Lannister and Baratheon, and with the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, and Tyrell, leads to full-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. Amidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors beyond.I'm really glad I purchased the DVD for this program - trying to keep track of seven intriguing families in a medieval setting can be quite a stretch, and really needs to be viewed more than once. The 'Episode Guide', included with the boxed set, and features family trees, is a real help. Add a little 'fantasy' to the story, and the production becomes even more interesting.The HBO production is First Rate. The sets are done in a semi-permanent method, and locations are in several different countries, including Iceland. Sets, locations, acting, costumes and make-up all show the attention to detail that is needed to make a believable project.  &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; and &#34;World Without End&#34; are two other recent efforts (Tandem Productions/Sony Pictures Home Entertainment) that also show what can be done to provide great entertainment.My favorite actor in this series has got to be Peter Dinklage, who plays Tyrion Lannister, and is often referred to as 'The Imp' due to his 'short stature'. He is thought to be a hedonistic fool, but he is really nobody's fool. He is the canniest character of the bunch, and always seems to maneuver himself into the most advantageous position. He is hedonistic, but that just adds to the fun of watching a good actor. His acting prowess in the first season, earned him much higher billing in the second.",5,A Great Effort By HBO,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,2326,"['Storyline', 'Seven', 'noble', 'families', 'fight', 'control', 'mythical', 'land', 'Westeros', 'Political', 'sexual', 'intrigue', 'pervasive', 'Robert', 'Baratheon', 'King', 'Westeros', 'old', 'friend', 'Eddard', 'Lord', 'Stark', 'serve', 'Hand', 'King', 'highest', 'official', 'Secretly', 'warned', 'previous', 'Hand', 'was', 'assassinated', 'Eddard', 'order', 'investigate', 'further', 'Meanwhile', 'Queen', 'family', 'Lannisters', 'may', 'be', 'hatching', 'plot', 'take', 'power', 'sea', 'last', 'members', 'previous', 'deposed', 'ruling', 'family', 'Targaryens', 'are', 'also', 'scheming', 'regain', 'throne', 'friction', 'houses', 'Stark', 'Lannister', 'Baratheon', 'remaining', 'great', 'houses', 'Greyjoy', 'Tully', 'Arryn', 'Tyrell', 'full-scale', 'war', 'very', 'ancient', 'evil', 'awakens', 'farthest', 'north', 'Amidst', 'war', 'political', 'confusion', 'neglected', 'military', 'order', 'misfits', 'Night', 'Watch', 'realms', 'men', 'icy', 'horrors', 'beyond.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'program', 'trying', 'keep', 'track', 'seven', 'intriguing', 'families', 'medieval', 'setting', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'stretch', 'really', 'be', 'viewed', 'more', 'once', ""'Episode"", 'Guide', 'included', 'boxed', 'set', 'features', 'family', 'trees', 'real', 'help', 'Add', 'little', ""'fantasy"", 'story', 'production', 'even', 'more', 'interesting.The', 'HBO', 'production', 'First', 'Rate', 'sets', 'are', 'done', 'semi-permanent', 'method', 'locations', 'are', 'several', 'different', 'countries', 'including', 'Iceland', 'Sets', 'locations', 'acting', 'costumes', 'make-up', 'show', 'attention', 'detail', 'needed', 'make', 'believable', 'project', '34', 'Pillars', 'Earth', '34', '34', 'World', 'End', '34', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'recent', 'efforts', 'Tandem', 'Productions/Sony', 'Pictures', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'also', 'show', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'provide', 'great', 'entertainment.My', 'favorite', 'actor', 'series', 'got', 'be', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'who', 'Tyrion', 'Lannister', 'often', 'referred', ""'The"", 'Imp', 'due', ""'short"", 'stature', 'thought', 'be', 'hedonistic', 'fool', 'really', 'nobody', 'fool', 'canniest', 'character', 'bunch', 'always', 'maneuver', 'most', 'advantageous', 'position', 'hedonistic', 'just', 'fun', 'watching', 'good', 'actor', 'acting', 'prowess', 'first', 'season', 'earned', 'much', 'higher', 'billing', 'second']",N/A

I don't usually like fantasy fiction. But I have now ordered the entire set of books -Song Of Ice and Fire Hardcover Box Set featuring A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, and A Feast for Crows (Amazon Exclusive)andA Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 5)and I plan on reading them very soon.The HBO series is one of the best productions - television or otherwise - that I have seen. We don't have HBO on our TV so I just rented the series.  What an entertaining last couple of days I've had, watching the first season straight through.Cinematography, special/visual effects, writing, editing, costuming, historical validity, musical score, setting, mapping, sound - all are fabulous.And the casting - wow! Each and every person was perfect for their role.  Like everyone else, I think, I loved Peter Dinklage in his role as Tyrion Lannister.  There are definitely many reasons he won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for this role, plus was nominated for and won many more. Sean Bean as Eddard Stark - perfect.  Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen - gorgeous AND perfect for the role. Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon - slimy and perfect in the role. I don't think I've ever seen a production of this size that was cast as well (thumbs up to Nina Gold, casting director).This is definitely an adults-only production.  Lots of nudity, sexual situations, incest, foul language, violence - it has it all. But it doesn't feel gratuitous.  It feels like I was plunked down to wander these kingdoms and was seeing life as it really was back then.I don't know how well this show follows the books.  I have heard and read from others that the producers/director, with the author's help, did a superior job.

If you have, then you really should be interested in this great Blu-Ray set.  The price is currently $39.99 (I mention this because other sets have gone up in price as they become scarce).  Hopefully this set will be in print for awhile.As most of you know, this series is based on the novels by George 'I hate Twitter' R.R. Martin.  The first season here follows the first novel pretty faithfully - which should appease some of you LOTR and Hobbit film haters (which deviated GREATLY from their novels).  Warning: have a strong stomach for blood, gore, violence, and nudity.  And now that I've gotten most of you readers interested...The story is simple, yet the characters and interactions are complex.  Martin created a pretty basic world without a lot of 'fleshing out', letting the story take it's own path and revealing little bits of lore and history here and there.  But he did spend a TON of time planning the families, their histories, their interactions, and so on.  People in Westeros are pretty rotten for the most part - which really makes you develop love-hate relationships.  It's great because when a main character is killed off, the viewer isn't really too sad about losing a really great hero - but more upset about losing an interesting character.The Blu-Ray is stunning, and a lot can be said about seeing this series in HD.  Granted, some of the effects can come off as a bit cheesy... I mean this is HBO budget, not Hollywood blockbuster budget... but the scenery and the sets are quite good.  Costuming is also top quality.  This is a series which is a delight in full HD.

And it looks like they've won.This is the HBO adaption of George R. R. Martin's best-selling epic, A Song of Ice and Fire.  A Game of Thrones is the first book in the series, and they have named the show accordingly.  So far, five books out of the planned seven volumes have been published.  The first show season covered the events in the first book.Sean Bean heads the stellar cast.  He plays the role of Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell.  He receives an offer from King Robert to take up the position of Hand of the King.  A position recently made vacant by the death of their former mentor, Lord Jon Arryn.  The King's Hand administers the country on behalf of the reigning monarch.  Eddard, known as Ned, takes half of his family down south to the capital, King's Landing.  Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, a marriage deal has been brokered between Princess Daenerys and Khal Drogo.  Daenerys and her older brother Viserys are the last of the Targaryens.  The Targaryens are an ancient noble family.  They have ruled Westeros for three hundred years until Robert Baratheon led a successful rebellion.  And now, the ambitious Prince Viserys wants to take back his throne, with the help of the Dothraki horselord, Khal Drogo.  In the far north, Ned's bastard son, Jon Snow takes his vows and joins the ancient brotherhood of the Nightwatch.This is a breakout performance for British actress Emilia Clarke.  She plays the role of the most important character in the entire epic saga, Princess Daenerys Targaryen.  Peter Dinklage plays the role of the Imp, Tyrion Lannister.  Lena Headey plays the role of the evil queen, Cersei Lannister.  Newcomer Kit Harrington plays the role of the bastard, Jon Snow.  And Michelle Fairley rounds out the stellar cast of first-tier characters by playing the part of Catelyn Tully-Stark, Ned's wife.Production values are of high quality.  The locations, mostly Northern Ireland, are nothing short of awesome.  And the special effects, especially in the season finale, are spectacular.  This, in my opinion, is the best show on HBO.

Amazing how much younger the characters seem in early episodes compared to season two, at least the ones who live. The most striking thing about this series is just how real and true it all seems despite the fantasy elements, from the nastiness of politics to the brutality of war and the justifications everyone makes for their decisions. Much like real life you'll find no one is an innocent here but you'll be rooting for some and loathing others nonetheless, and that's the great part of this show, almost every character has a compelling backstory and they all seem to be fighting for something missing in their lives, from love to power to dragons. Of all the cable shows out there, this has been the only one I've bothered with. George R.R.

1269695,A2GOTXRA1HV9MU,B002IFT1ZA,Dan,"[29, 37]","I wont waste time going into the story.  You can see plenty of that in the other reviews.The Blu-Ray is excellent and takes advantage of the format more than any disc I currently own.  The picture is flawless with bright colors and a life-like image.  You will notice details you didn't during the original broadcast airing.  For example, the scenes in the crypt were sort of dark and hard to make out during the original airing have been lightened up a bit.  You can see more details of the statues of the Stark ancestry.The DTS audio track is amazing!  Your side channels will get quite a workout.  The sound is immersive, but not overbearing.  I could crank the volume up fairly loud and it still would sound perfect.  I have a 7.1 surround sound system, and there was one scene early in the first episode where a raven comes flying in from the rear to the front that startled my cat and I.  I simply wasn't expecting that sort of detail in sound.There are quite a few extras.  The one that really stands out is the in-episode guide to the Seven Kingdoms.  When you turn this feature on, a side menu with four icons appears over the picture.  Don't worry, you can make it transparent so it's not blocking the scenes.  The first icon brings up a list of characters that are currently in the scene and will give you a bit of information about them when you select them from the list.  The second icon gives you the current location, also with a bit of information.  The 4th icon takes you to the complete guide where you can access all of it's content from a single menu.Then you have the third icon, the History icon, and this is the most interesting.  Periodically, when a character mentions something from past history, it will flash.  When you select that icon, you will see a list of history items, and the one that was just ""unlocked"" will be selected.  Press this, and you're taken to a short animated video segment explaining the historic moment the character just mentioned, narrated by one of the characters in the story.  Sometimes its the same historic moment from another viewpoint; so not only does it give you history, it gives you historical perspective from the different houses.  After the history video, it brings you right back to the episode where it continues.  Most of this history is in the narrative of the books, and so I think this was a very clever (and well produced) way to get that narrative back into the hands of the viewers.  It makes this world even richer than it was when we first viewed the series.I also feel that watching episodes back to back makes the series much enjoyable and easier to understand.  This show is dense with characters, history and plot.  So having to wait a week meant having all these details fade before the next episode.  I feel like I appreciate this series even more now that I own it.Finally, I actually received my set on Monday, one day before release the street date, when they had guaranteed release day delivery.  I guess that's one of the perks of being a Prime member.  Kudos to Amazon for their great service.  :)Great series.  Outstanding reference-quality Blu-Ray.

This design does take up more space since this one season ends up in a package about the same size as my entire series set for Rome.One small thing on my wishlist: Episode 6 has a detailed making-of-the-episode, but I wish more episodes had this type of breakdown explaining how they did the CGI, stunts, and filming. There's also a half-hour ""making of"" feature on the final disc that talks about the entire season and includes some clips that were deleted from the final cut.",5,Bluray packaging and presentation is excellent,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,921,"['Show', 'obviously', 'amazing', 'video', 'audio', 'are', 'excellent', ""'m"", 'mainly', 'here', 'rave', 'packaging', 'packaging', 'superb', 'beautiful', 'character', 'portraits', 'flip-out', 'disc', 'holder', 'discs', 'are', 'old-school', 'plastic', 'design', 'where', 'press', 'center', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'disc', 'prefer', 'design', 'fancier', 'stuff', 'had', 'bluray', 'get', 'scratched', 'Rome', 'set', 'where', 'have', 'slide', 'disc', 'sleeve', 'design', 'take', 'up', 'more', 'space', 'one', 'season', 'up', 'package', 'same', 'size', 'entire', 'series', 'set', 'Rome.One', 'small', 'thing', 'wishlist', 'Episode', '6', 'detailed', 'making-of-the-episode', 'wish', 'more', 'episodes', 'had', 'type', 'breakdown', 'explaining', 'how', 'did', 'CGI', 'stunts', 'filming', 'also', 'half-hour', 'making', 'feature', 'final', 'disc', 'entire', 'season', 'clips', 'were', 'deleted', 'final', 'cut']",N/A
1269712,AMFMVWHYF2Q6T,B002IFT1ZA,D. C. Obraztsov,"[35, 48]","IF YOU'VE NEVER READ GAME OF THRONES.....Should you watch the show or read the book first? (no real spoilers)First - just to note (in case you didn't know), Game of Thrones is based on a book series called ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" by George R.R. Martin.  There are five so far (the first written in 1996, the most recent written in 2011), and he's planning to write at least two more (at the time of this review - 1/4/12).  ""A Game of Thrones"" is the first installment of the series.  HBO decided they liked the name ""Game of Thrones"" rather than ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" (I can see why - sounds less fantasy and more mainstream) and so that's the name of the whole series.  Each season is based on one novel.  So the first season was based on ""A Game of Thrones"" and the second season will be based on the second book, ""A Clash of Kings,"" and so on.  Well, it may not be in exact perfect book order, and it will be interesting to see what they do in books 4 and 5, which have overlapping storylines.  Plus, aCoK is really too long to have in one season...the second season will air in April, 2012.Anyway, back to the original question.  Show or book first?This is a really difficult question.  For most books turned into show/movie, you'll want to read the book first, because it is usually superior to the adaptation.  However, we are talking about HBO here, so be prepared for a VERY good show.  Are there differences from the book?  Yes, but in general it stays true to the storyline and all differences are done artistically and were approved by the author, George R.R. Martin.NUMBER OF CHARACTERS - There are a LOT of characters in this story.  Because the show has to be condensed somewhat from a 800 page novel to 10 hours of airtime, it can get really confusing to know who is who while watching the show.  It can get confusing in the book as well, but things are usually more detailed for you in the book so it is easier to reference.  However, it always help to put a face to a name, so that's a plus for the show.  But once again, sometimes there will be a really long part in the book that will be eliminated entirely from the show, and the absence can throw you off a little.  The book definitely has more backstory, and you'll probably be able to more accurately identify characters when watching the show after.NEW SCENES FOR THE SHOW - Since we can't just look into the minds of the characters as in the book, there are a lot of invented scenes between characters in the show.  This isn't a bad thing, but it's just to give you more of an idea of who these people are and what is going on in their minds.  There is also a (sort-of) made-up character for the show, the prostitute Ros.  At first I thought she was added in there for just eye candy or something and found that sort of annoying, but ultimately I think she is just an outlet for us to get into the minds of characters since it's a show and not a book.  Also, her interactions with Greyjoy display (in my opinion) his disgusting personality, and since he's a much more important character in book 2 than 1 (his personality and backstory are almost non-existent in Book 1, they just hint at it), Ros was a way to kind of ease his character into the second season.DIFFERENCES - Like I said, the show is generally true to the book.  However, if you read the book first, you may get super annoyed with some of the differences when watching the show.  One of the major differences is ages.  Everyone is a lot older in the show (the children, especially), and people are generally a lot different and better looking.  That's not really an issue though, or else the show would seem odd and creepy.  An example is Dany, a 13 year old in the book, is in frequent nude and sex scenes.  In the show, I think they say she is 17 (but the actress is actually 24).  It would also seem silly if Robb (14ish in the book) was actually 14 in the show, with him playing the type of role he has.  My major gripe was a few storyline differences that I didn't think were necessary at all for the show, but I'm a nitpicker.  An example is the major absence of direwolves in the show.  They're there, but are much more prevalent in the book!  I love the direwolves and think they are very symbolic, and wish HBO did more with them.  Maybe next season.DO YOU LIKE TO READ? - That's probably the best way to decide.  The book is BIG.  Around 800 pages.  It's similar in size to a Harry Potter book, and in my opinion, even more captivating.  But it's a LOT of material, and you have to really pay attention due to the number of characters and intertwining story lines.  If reading isn't your strong suit, the show may be better at breaking it down for you.  If you are interested in reading all of the books, that's about 5,000 pages to trek through.  For comparison - if you read the Harry Potter books, all 7 books in the series are roughly the same number of pages as the first FOUR books of A Song of Ice and Fire.YOU CAN'T GO WRONGIf you are an HBO fan, you know that HBO doesn't produce garbage.  This show is a masterpiece - one of my favorite shows in a long, long time.  It reminds me of a mix of Lord of the Rings and the Sopranos, with it's edgy, unforgiving attitude and a splash, but not too much, of fantasy.  People aren't casting spells with wands like Harry Potter or anything.  The fantasy aspect is very, very subtle.  Actually, way more subtle than I expected.  It's very reminiscent of medieval times.  The acting is superb and like most HBO shows, there aren't a lot of big names.  Sean Bean and Peter Dinklage are probably the most well-known.  The scenery and the show itself is drop dead gorgeous, however, maybe due to budget constraints, the show feels quite a bit ""smaller"" than the book.  Feasts, castles, celebrations, cities....all seem smaller in the show.I think all changes in the show were done very well and nothing butchered the book.  Although nothing can compare to the books for me, I think aids it in really bringing it to life.  Plus, Martin was along for the ride of the writing and making of the show, so you know he'll try not to let writers deviate too much from the heart of the story.My two major recommendations are:#1 - watch show, read book, re-watch show: this is better if it's hard for you to get into books or just really want to see it first.  Then you can read the book, and think, ""Hmm...I never remember seeing this person,"" and low and behold, when you watch it the second time around, that character IS there.  It really puts the pieces together.  However, prepare to be confused.  This is normal. The show has many, many major characters, and it can be really difficult to keep track.  I know several people who only watched the show and didn't read the book who can't point out Varys.  If you read the book, you damn well know who that is!  The show and the book alike both start out a little bit slow....but trust me, they both quickly turn into something quite thrilling and action-packed.  Just wait until Season 2.#2 - read the book, then watch the show: the only downside to this is that you may sometimes be disappointed if things don't live up to your idea of the books standards.  You might find yourself saying things like, ""WHAT!  That's not how they consummated!"" and nitpick.  However, you'll understand MUCH more of of what is happening in the show with your book knowledge.Also, this book was right up HBO's lane.  HBO likes to make gritty, real, intense and often unforgivingly brutal shows.  There aren't any good or bad guys, and when you think you found one....well, take a closer look.  Sick of fantasy books where things are too black and white (too good vs. evilish) or where the big characters are never killed off no matter how many deadly situations they are in?  Sick of books just not being REAL?  Well, Game of Thrones, the book and the movie, are a fantasy lover's dream.  Whether or book or show first, watch and read them both to really appreciate the art of Game of Thrones and the Song of Ice and Fire and series.",5,For the Game of Thrones Newbie - SPOILER

Martin, it's nevertheless a study of human emotions and motives, mixed with political intrigues that even those who don't necessarily like fantasy can enjoy.  Among many notable performances by the actors in the series, Sean Bean gives a wonderful performance as Eddard Stark, the Lord of Winterfell.  He's a strong leader with no political ambitions and has been content to stay in his hold in the north.  He is coerced into becoming the &#34;Hand&#34; of the king, Robert Baratheon, whom he helped to claim the Iron Throne after the murder of Aerys II Targaryen, popularly called the Mad King, by Jaime Lannister.  Lord Stark must move to Kings Landing, the capital in the south, and learn the ways of the court.After the questionable death of the King, his son Joffrey Baratheon takes the Iron Throne.  Joffrey is a coward as well as a cruel and despotic young man who enjoys inflicting misery upon others, especially his fiancee, Sansa Stark.  Lord Stark's other daughter, Arya, is a delightful, but wilful young lady who tends to be a tomboy. Lord Stark begins questioning whether Joffrey is really the king's son, which leads to his political downfall.Another part of the storyline concerns Daenerys Targaryen, the daughter of Aerys II Targaryen.  She and her older brother fled the Seven Kingdoms after their father was murdered.  She is forced by her brother to marry Khal Drogo, but the union turns into a love match.  Daenerys wants to reclaim the Iron Throne, which she feels is hers by birthright.Adding to all of the political intrigues taking place throughout the Seven Kingdoms is a lurking danger coming from the north.  There is a 700 foot tall wall of ice in the north that protects the Seven Kingdoms from dangers from the north beyond the Wall.

Martin's fantasy epic A Song Of Ice And Fire was being adapted for television -- and HBO crafts it with all the dignity it deserves, with plenty of grime, blood and a tangle of convoluted storylines.The castle of Winterfell is thrown on its ear when King Robert (Mark Addy) of Westeros arrives to ask Eddard ""Ned"" Stark (Sean Bean) to be his Hand. But soon after Ned agrees, he receives a message from his mentor's widow, informing him that Queen Cersei's (Lena Headey) family, the Lannisters, are secretly plotting against the king -- and that they are killing off anyone who might be a threat to them.One of Ned's younger sons is gravely wounded when he sees something shocking, and the acid-tongued dwarf Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) is framed for the crime. Ned's bastard son Jon (Kit Harington) joins the Watch near the Wall -- but has little idea of the horrors that are approaching with the White Walkers.And across the Narrow Sea, exiled princess Daenerys Targaryen is wed to the barbarian lord Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa), so that her brother can invade Westeros and take back the throne. But Daenerys quickly grows in strength and wisdom, and the Small Council of Westeros has reason to fear her when it's found that she's pregnant -- but her greatest power is that of the dragon's daughter.As Ned takes to his new duties, he begins investigating the death of his predecessor, and begins to uncover a shocking secret about the queen and her children. Treachery, death and war will be brought to Westeros, and a war will begin with the blood of the good-hearted.""A Game of Thrones"" is truly an epic story -- it took a whole ten episodes to encapsulate a single book, and the story is far from over. There are countless plot threads woven into one enormous, bloodsoaked tapestry, linked together even if they are technically separate. And since this is only based on the first of Martin's books, it ends on a note both depressing and uplifting. Lots of plot threads are left dangling, but in such a way that you end up wanting to know what happens next.The entire series is draped in cold stone walls, grimy medieval atmosphere, windswept steppes, splatters of dark blood and the occasional sunny day. They don't skimp on explicit violence (including the death of a beloved character) or sex, but the focus here is always on the clashing families, battles and seedy plots of the queen. And despite that focus, there is still a hint of the magical in this fantasy -- talk of dragons, the White Walkers and their undead wights.As for the cast, it is BRILLIANT -- Sean Bean is perfection as the world-weary, good-hearted Eddard, and he's got a brilliant backing cast in Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, the amazing Peter Dinklage, Jason Momoa, Michelle Fairley, and countless others. Even the child actors like Maisie Williams and Jack Gleeson are absolute perfection.And best of all, their characters are all so REAL. They have good points and bad points, strengths and failings, and they often change drastically over the course of the season (Daenerys turns from a pallid little wallflower to a powerful and icy queen).""A Game of Thrones"" is a truly spellbinding experience, if not one that you want to see all together.

1269752,A2LY87A30IOYNX,B002IFT1ZA,ecclesial hypostasis,"[3, 4]","HBO have made an art form of producing long, complex and brilliant television series packed full of gritty realism and adult content, eg. The Sopranos, Entourage, and of course The Wire. If you had to choose a fantasy series that would fit this mould, then George Martin's brutal epic 'A Song of Ice and Fire' would immediately spring to mind. It is as though he had written for this format from the beginning. 'A Game of Thrones' is essentially a hybrid of The Sopranos and Lord of the Rings, where feuding noble houses engage in intricate power games in a fantasy landscape which is threatened both by a relentless demonic winter and the return of the dragons.The best way to describe this series is to say that it is a remarkably faithful adaptation of the first novel. The writers adhere closely to Martin's story and characters, down to identical scenes and lines. The complexities of the plot are conveyed well, as is the 'tone' of the books. If you enjoy the books you will find much to enjoy here. The production values are excellent, with an attention to detail and effects that echoes Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films. The actors are mostly excellent, particularly Maisie Williams as Arya and the inspired choice of Peter Dinklage as Tyrion. Sean Bean simply is Eddard Stark, though it feels a bit like Boromir has somehow wandered into the HBO studio. As in the book, though, the sections set in Westeros are immeasurably better than the storyline of Danaerys and her travels in the East, which feel like a parody of an old sword and sandal flick.The Song of Ice and Fire books are chock full of sex and violence, so both make an appearance on screen here. The violence is done right, brutal and not hidden by cutaways. If someone cuts off a head or rips out a throat, we get to see it. One of the strengths of Martin's stories is that they do not romanticise violence. The sex in his books is also largely about the exercise of power and a comment on the difficulty of real relationships in this feudal society, not about giving the reader a thrill. HBO made the unfortunate choice of turning this into an excuse for titillation, with scenes that stick out as pandering in the way that they did in parts of The Wire. Though at least the word 'teats' seems to have gotten lost 'twixt book and screen.'A Game of Thrones' is the best book in the series, with a strong arc both for the overall plot and for individual characters. The following books have had a tendency to meander and to pile bleak and depressing events upon each other. I'm not sure they would translate as well to the screen.

1269761,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B002IFT1ZA,Enjolras,"[11, 20]","I tried watching this show because so many people have compared it to Lord of the Rings. However, that comparison is superficial at best. Like LOTR, the producers of Game of Thrones did a good job recreating Medieval style costumes and scenery. That's about the only similarity.In terms of the plot and characters - what really matters - the two couldn't be more different. LOTR has an epic story of war and morality, with fascinating characters and deep character studies. Game of Thrones, by contrast, seems to be populated by a bunch of losers and whores. I've watched 2 episodes - got too bored to finish - and couldn't detect anything resembling an interesting story. There's a few minutes of mysterious blue-eyed monsters killing people in the first episode (what I thought were lousy special effects), but most of the series seems to focus around the drama of the king's family.Even after 2 hours of watching, I barely remembered any of the characters' names, much less cared about them. Except for Sean Bean's character, they all seem equally annoying. The only point I got excited was when I thought the little girl was going to kill the obnoxious blond kid (alas, she didn't). Unlike Tolkien's Hobbits, the series doesn't have a point of view character who pulls the viewer into the world, making it tough to invest in the characters. This is especially problematic when there are so many characters, most of who fail to make much of an impression.On another note, HBO seems obsessed with sex and violence in its shows. As a matter of artistic preference, I don't have a problem with explicit sex or violence scenes, but only if they serve the story or character development. However, in Game of Thrones, the directors certainly weren't subtle in their cinematography. At times, I felt like I was watching a porno - I felt embarrassed to be watching it with my wife. Much of it seemed thrown in there for the sake of titillating audiences when a far more subtle approach would have served just as well.I haven't read the book so I don't know whether the HBO series is doing it justice. However, I'd warn fans of LOTR and other fantasy classics that they'll likely find Game of Thrones disappointing. It's too bad - with the sort of money HBO has, it has the ability to create a genuine fantasy epic TV show, but instead we get Desperate Housewives in a Medieval setting.",2,Not like LOTR at all,1335830400,"05 1, 2012",2012,2380,"['tried', 'watching', 'show', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'compared', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'However', 'comparison', 'superficial', 'best', 'LOTR', 'producers', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'recreating', 'Medieval', 'style', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'only', 'similarity.In', 'terms', 'plot', 'characters', 'what', 'really', 'two', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'different', 'LOTR', 'epic', 'story', 'war', 'morality', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'deep', 'character', 'studies', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'contrast', 'be', 'populated', 'bunch', 'losers', 'whores', ""'ve"", 'watched', '2', 'episodes', 'got', 'too', 'bored', 'finish', 'could', ""n't"", 'detect', 'anything', 'resembling', 'interesting', 'story', 'few', 'minutes', 'mysterious', 'blue-eyed', 'monsters', 'killing', 'people', 'first', 'episode', 'what', 'thought', 'were', 'lousy', 'special', 'effects', 'most', 'series', 'focus', 'drama', 'king', 'family.Even', '2', 'hours', 'watching', 'barely', 'remembered', 'characters', 'names', 'much', 'less', 'cared', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'character', 'seem', 'equally', 'annoying', 'only', 'point', 'got', 'excited', 'was', 'when', 'thought', 'little', 'girl', 'was', 'going', 'kill', 'obnoxious', 'blond', 'kid', 'alas', 'did', ""n't"", 'Tolkien', 'Hobbits', 'series', ""n't"", 'have', 'point', 'view', 'character', 'who', 'viewer', 'world', 'making', 'tough', 'invest', 'characters', 'especially', 'problematic', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'most', 'who', 'fail', 'make', 'much', 'impression.On', 'note', 'HBO', 'obsessed', 'sex', 'violence', 'shows', 'matter', 'artistic', 'preference', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'explicit', 'sex', 'violence', 'scenes', 'only', 'serve', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'However', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'directors', 'certainly', 'were', ""n't"", 'subtle', 'cinematography', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'porno', 'felt', 'embarrassed', 'be', 'watching', 'wife', 'Much', 'seemed', 'thrown', 'sake', 'titillating', 'audiences', 'when', 'far', 'more', 'subtle', 'approach', 'would', 'have', 'served', 'just', 'well.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'HBO', 'series', 'doing', 'justice', 'However', ""'d"", 'warn', 'fans', 'LOTR', 'other', 'fantasy', 'classics', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'find', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'disappointing', 'too', 'bad', 'sort', 'money', 'HBO', 'ability', 'create', 'genuine', 'fantasy', 'epic', 'TV', 'show', 'instead', 'get', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Medieval', 'setting']",N/A

1269769,A1GXBMUTVHWHJL,B002IFT1ZA,Flash,"[0, 1]","I read the book several years ago and I currently think that it is one of the best of the fantasy genre. This HBO television adaptation of the George RR Martin's story is right on with nearly every detail. And although I already knew how things were going to play out by the end of this season one (book one) story arc, I still found the action to be riveting, suspenseful and dramatic. I am downright amazed at how good this TV show turned out to be.The Story - As a single novel, ""A Game of Thrones"" is one of the most interesting, innovative and surprising stories of its kind. Martin has created his very own unique overlay to the traditional fantasy yarn, one that clouds the distinctions between good and evil and one that is based on well thought out character types and world building. The set up for the larger story (in the books that follow) is outstanding. The TV show is completely true to the story.The Characters - Martin's characters (and there are lots of them) have some real depth and dimension, but the TV show really takes these characters even further into the visual dimension. I think it added to what I already thought I knew about these characters. And while every single actor is perfect in their role, I was especially impressed by Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannaster, Maisie Williams as Arya Stark and Kit Harington as Jon Snow. These three are definitely some of the most interesting characters from the books and their portrayals were dead on.The Setting - The overall look to this TV show is wonderful! The settings are true to their geographic placement in Martin's world, but they are also so accurately and interestingly detailed. In the special features, it was stated that each place was to have its own unique look, so that you knew immediately that you were in Winterfell, The Wall or Kings Landing.Overall, five stars for this perfect TV show adaptation. I'm anxiously awaiting the next couple of seasons because they should be just as good as this first season.",5,"Wow!

From the very first scene, I was intrigued about what is going on in this world and that only grew as I was introduced to and got to know the characters in this fantasy world.Game of Thrones is set in some archaic world of sword-fighting, knights, and court intrigue...to put it mildly.  Also, on this world, the summers and winters can last for years and there are these scary beings who live beyond a huge wall of ice that is patrolled by the sworn men of the Night Watch.  The world is broken up into Seven Kingdoms, all ruled by a King who took the Iron Throne when the former royal family was driven across the sea (leaving just a sister and brother of that line to try and re-claim the throne).  The King's best friend and supporter is ""Ned"" (played wonderfully by Sean Bean, better known from The Lord of the Rings) who lives up north, has a boatload of kids he's trying to raise to be honorable, and tries to steer clear of politics.  To little avail, of course.There are many characters to love and characters to hate.  Just as there are dirty little secrets to be kept, double-crossing of all kinds, and hints of scary stuff to be unleashed once the long winter's night finally falls.  Oh, and hints of dragons once past and perhaps yet to be.Be warned, there are gory bits in this show, nudity, and general nastiness.  But there are also scenes where honor is upheld no matter the cost and where characters come into their own, overcoming huge trials in the process.  There are also plenty of gray characters who you never know whether to trust or not, as well as characters who are just plain crackerjack crazy.  This show will definitely keep you guessing...Perhaps, the biggest issue was in trying to keep all of then straight at first and figuring out who belongs to what house and has what totem (stags, dire wolves, lions, or dragons are the four main ones), but by the third episode or so you will figure it all out.  I could have used a bit less gore in a few scenes, as well...but overall this is a fabulous fantasy series, one well worth hitching a ride on.  Take a chance.

1269788,A3BXOADDSC4BJU,B002IFT1ZA,Glovely,"[3, 34]","While I have after several viewings managed to ""get into"" Game of Thrones, I can't help enjoying it with reservations because:1) I'm not a fantasy aficionado and don't have quite the appreciation of ""world-building"" which the more seasoned fantasy enthusiasts seem to applaud. This is why I had to stop after a certain point when reading Tolkien. I finished the Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings, and Silmarillion. Halfway through Unfinished Tales I just thought--and feel free to laugh--""who cares""? It had stopped being a story and become, to me, a sort of desperate escapist history which couldn't have ended until Tolkien died, and clearly not even then. (Perhaps I am being unkind to Tolkien since a lot of his Middle Earth lore was published posthumously anyway. Perhaps he never intended to publish any of it and it's his fans who can't let go.) And though Game of Thrones is, so far, the only addition to my viewing diet that is of the Dungeons & Dragons sort, and in spite of the show's creators' best efforts to foreground the drama rather than the fantasy, I here and there find myself blushing over some quite awful writing of the ""you can, you must"" or ""I can, and I will"" variety (as if they'd never read Shakespeare, or read him and resisted him), as well as over the rather far-fetched proper names of peoples/places which sound like they were wrenched from the board-game/trading-card imaginations of unbecoming nerds. In other words, Game of Thrones too often feels like the product of a sad loser made for sad losers. (And even then, sad losers are the products of bad parents, bad education systems, income disparity, structural inequality, etc. So they can hardly be blamed.)2) Despite my reservations I know Game of Thrones could have been far worse: it could have been more like the books on which it was based. Granted, I have never read any of the books, but I spent days systematically reading every 1-,2-,and 3-star review for them on this website. Okay, a bit of an overstatement since I did this almost a year ago and more reviews were undoubtedly added since then. Even so, there were quite enough reviews a year ago for me to decide that I would NEVER read the books. This was due to my impression that:a) the fantasy element in the books is present to an extent which I would find unbearable. The author's tendency to overload the narrative with unnecessary detail and history of his fantasy world was a serious complaint among the reviewers: the word ""editor"" was mentioned a lot, often in conjunction with ""where was the,"" and more often in conjunction with ""where the ---- was the.""b) in spite of a 700 to 1000-page minimum per book, and in spite of the publication of 5 books over 16 years (1996-present) the story is still not finished. But not only is the story not finished: the other serious complaint is that the plot is headed absolutely nowhere. (Hint: The author was a writer for TV serials in Hollywood in the '80s. Were the expectations high to begin with?)I'm unqualified to speculate what fate awaits the books, except to say I feel sorry for those fans who spent so much time reading them only to become increasingly frustrated by what seems no more than a marketing ploy designed to keep stringing them along. (It takes 10 hours to finish the first season of Game of Thrones. How many hours did it take to slog through Game of Thrones the novel, let alone the whole series thus far? Again, they have my profound sympathy.) What doom this spells for the TV series is harder to say. Presumably the show's existence hinges on the books' existence, although perhaps not necessarily so: I vaguely remember watching an interview in which the author stated that he had divulged certain plot points to the show's creators in the event that he was hit by a bus (no comment) before bringing the book series to its conclusion. Then again, HBO often cancels its series before their completion, and sometimes for quite inexplicable reasons. (In the instance of Rome the reason was reportedly a financial one. Fine. In the instance of Deadwood it was never clear if the reason was to do with money or ratings. Then they cancelled John from Cincinnati for its mere 3-million viewership. Huh?) At the moment, however, Game of Thrones has nothing to fear: consumer interest is apparently strong enough for HBO to have ordered a third and fourth season (that's 2 years) to cover the third novel Storm of Swords. And who knows how the two novels after that will be divided. It's certainly enough time for the author to decide if he's going to keep scribbling in the margins or give his poor readers their due.",1,It Could Have Been Worse. . . .

The much touted HBO miniseries A GAME OF THRONES arrived with Episode 1, and though the entire series cannot be judged on one episode, this initial hour has all the promise of an involving and visually stunning adaptation of the 1996 George R.R. Martin series of books of adult fantasy fiction titled 'A Song of Ice and Fire'.  The 'game' is played by seven families - Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, and Tyrell - and what we find in the initial episode is a taste of the intrigue to come.In this first episode Lord Eddard Stark (Sean Bean) is the patriarch of House Stark, one of the major noble houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and ancestral rulers of the North. Near the castle of Winterfell, Eddard's children discover a dead direwolf and five of its pups still alive. As the direwolf is the symbol of the Starks, Eddard allows each of his five children to keep one of the pups as pet. A sixth pup is discovered a short distance away from the others. It is a mute albino, and this one is given to Jon Snow (Kit Harington), the bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark. King Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy) , Eddard's childhood friend, journeys to Winterfell with his family to ask Eddard to become Hand of the King, the top advisor and military commander in the realm, due to the death of the previous Hand, Lord Jon Arryn. Eddard's wife, Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley), receives a letter from her sister Lysa Arryn, stating that Jon Arryn's death was a murder plotted by Queen Cersei (Lena Headey) and her powerful family, the Lannisters. Though reluctant to leave his duties and family, Eddard is convinced by his wife to accept the position in order to investigate Jon Arryn's death. Eddard's middle son Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) is engaging in climbing Winterfell castle's walls and towers accidentally sees Queen Cersei and her twin brother Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) having incestuous relations. To protect their secret affair, Jaime throws the boy out of a tower window.  Where the story goes form here will follow throughout the remaining episodes.Though some would criticize an early report on a series merely at its inception, it seems only fitting that offering a word on encouragement to pay attention to this new series is warranted.  We can only hope that the series continues to build as it progresses.  The cast is filled with excellent actors, both seasoned and refreshingly new.

As I have not read the books yet I can really judge this show based on how it plays as a standalone piece as opposed to comparing it to the source. I think the acting is brilliant, the directing, the sets, sceneries (most of all of this show is shot on location) special effects and casting as well as pacing is stellar. I have absolutely no complaints about this show. It's the best show on tv right now (aside from Breaking Bad) and easily the best piece of fantasy ever shot for television. On Blu-Ray this show is immaculate, black levels are deep, colors are vibrant and lush, texture detail is sharp, and with certain scenes being shot on 35mm, actually have retained film grain. This show has everything that a fantasy fan could want, zombies, dragons, beheadings and tons of great female nudity. Since this show plays on HBO the standard running time per episode is about an hour since there are no commercial breaks. Special features are plentiful and the audio commentary is entertaining and informative as it should be. Any fan of Lord Of The Rings or Frank Frazetta art or Conan The Barbarian will like this show for the same reasons they like those fantasy pieces. This show doesn't cater to stupid people, if you aren't paying attention then you won't be able to keep track of people or place names.

No one is what they seem, any predictions you make will be confounded and not one player has a golden ticket for survival. Every character, even those who on the surface level appear evil have their conflicted sides, their understandable motivations, their troubled pasts. Complexity abounds but never gets in the way of good honest fun - this spirit is perfectly embodied by the undoubted star of Game of Thrones, Tyrion Lannister 'the imp' played by the disarmingly charismatic Peter Dinklage. The diminutive rascal towers above the competition delivering classic aside after classic aside - whether cracking funnies, delivering put downs, double dealing to save his skin or even dropping an unexpected 'C' bomb when referring to his warmongering and domineering father everything he does turns to gold. He even whistles while he works like an x-rated new member of the seven dwarves - Deviant perhaps?Other standout performances are Emilia Clarke's turn as the beautiful but deadly Daenerys, she gives the character an otherworldly innocence mixed with an unexpected fierceness, and Aidan Gillen's smirking schemer Petyr Baelish, a real slippery snake with a twinkle in the eye. Saying that everyone will have their favourites, lord knows there are about forty major characters, and none of the cast obviously hit a bum note. Special mention in this regard should go to the child actors, five or so of whom play very important roles - Jack Gleeson in particular deserves credit for making the sadistic wimp Joffrey quite so hilariously repellent!The extras on the DVD are a mixed bag really, the character profiles are very short though of course it's a nice touch to see the actor's candidly championing their on-screen counterparts. The real draw for me was seeing what George R. R. Martin had to say about the enterprise and working out just how close his involvement was. The impression I got was pretty close and I'd recommend that in addition to watching the short 'Making Of' and 'From Book to Screen' films that you also listen to his commentary track for Episode 8 - I have to admit that I very rarely listen to any commentaries on DVDs but made an exception in this case and it was interesting hearing him vigorously defending the choices that were made for the adaptation.Game of Thrones - the only mainstream show to feature a decapitation roughly once every other episode.

I had heard of it earlier but thought it's some sort of a show about a moving circus. Then I saw Peter Dinklage's amazing body language upon receiving the Golden Globe for acting. I was still not convinced about whether or not I should see this show so I asked a knowledgable friend if this was anywhere in the league of Spartacus. He said it was maybe the best tv show he had ever seen putting aside the Sopranos and The Wire (former my favorite, latter his all time favorite) so anyway I decided I must watch.The show is based on kings, seven kingdoms, dragons, magic, demons, jesters, men, harlots, a very bleak sense of humor sometimes almost too cruel but the direction is absolutely stellar which means despite having such a prodigious quantity of creatures and characters, the show maintains a thoroughly engaging plot and script.At the end of the first show, I sat at my screen unblinking and revered by what had transpired. The last four episodes of this season were so engaging that I saw them one after another. The ninth episode called Baelor is when I stood up in front of my television screen hurling words and pumping my fist in the air. I don't clearly remember but it was a scene in TROY which made me do something like this almost a decade back.Anyhow, all characters, whether likable or despicable, seem to have a stranglehold to them.And yes, it would be safe to add GAME OF THRONES to the lineage created by many first seasons like ""Prison Break"" , ""Lost"" , ""Spartacus"" , ""Sopranos"" as one of the most REMARKABLE and unobtrusive study of the land. I, however, secretly think this may just turn out to be the greatest television series ever. Writing a review for something of this magnitude isn't easy.

Frankly, I'd rather play the game of Jenga; the repercussions are less dire. When you hear the term ""transcendent television"" being bandied about, you must break out that grain of salt. Except that GAME OF THRONES does fit the phrase. It deserves all the plaudits. I've finally caught up with this show, and I am astounded with how good it is. Big ups to HBO for going all in with fantasy writer George R.R. Martin's sweeping saga of warring dynasties and dark magic beyond the border. It's a hell of an undertaking. I'll be emptying out my bin of adjectives.George R.R. Martin has a knack for making his readers care for his characters, and this seamlessly translates onto the screen, by virtue of exceptional writing, superb production values, and a scintillating cast. The thought and labor that went into the exquisite show opening alone informs you that the showrunners are not effing about.The canvas spans geographies and numbers a sprawling cast. In a world in which summers span decades and murderous winters can last a lifetime, powerful noble families play the game of thrones. In the chilly north, the undermanned Night's Watch diligently patrols the ancient Wall, safeguarding the realm from demonic elements that stalk the darkness beyond. Except that there's been nary a sighting of these fell creatures in many decades. The Night's Watch, long since fallen on hard times, nowadays tends to be composed of felons, knaves, and vagabonds.While much of the story takes place in the Seven Kingdoms and focuses on the power struggle between the honorable Starks and the conniving Lannisters, things are developing in the East, in the grassy plains of Essos. There, the son of a deposed king hungers for what once was his inheritance, to the extent that he sells his petrified sister to the warlord of the fierce Dothraki, a clan of nomadic horsemen, in hopes of marshalling an army. From the first episode, ominous clouds of war hover over the Seven Kingdoms.I can't recall a recent show that's gripped me so from jump. Showrunners/head writers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss invest these ten episodes with humanity and amazing clarity. This is a remarkable feat, given the complex characters and dense mythology and the many interweaving plot threads and the huge chunks of exposition. This being a faithful adaptation of Martin's novel, you can't sit easy. Favorite characters may or may not break your heart, may or may not make it to Season Two.Credit the writers but also credit the actors for bringing their roles to vivid, full-blooded life. I dunno, maybe it's the British accents. Love them, hate them, but each part is nuanced, each character not altogether noble, not altogether depraved. Excepting the vile Prince Joffrey; I really hate that kid, all praise to young Jack Gleeson for eliciting such emotion. I didn't think I could sympathize with Lena Headey's scheming Cersei Lannister but there are moments in which she demonstrates an aching vulnerability (which she then promptly masks). Sean Bean - or ""poster boy,"" to quote one of the showrunners - lends marvelous gravitas to his lead role of Eddard Stark. But, to me, the ones who really stand out are the misfits and outcasts. I love, really love, the clever dwarf prince Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) and Eddard Stark's feisty tomboy daughter Arya Stark (star-in-the-making Maisie Wiliams) and Eddard's bastard son Jon Snow (Kit Harington). Dinklage so well-deserved his Emmy and Golden Globe awards.Lastly, we are so lucky that GAME OF THRONES ended up on cable. It it had landed on one of them regular networks, it's probably canceled by now. As it is, Season Two can't have come soon enough. To echo one and all, GAME OF THRONES is a rousing triumph of style AND substance and a dazzling psychological drama. It is magnificently realized and stunningly visualized. And those direwolves are just too damn cute.This impressive DVD set is boss! It collects all ten episodes of Season One and comes with five discs. The bonus features:- ""Complete Guide to Westeros"" - a comprehensive and interactive break-down of the Lands and Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, including character profiles- ""Making GAME OF THRONES

1269823,A1TS5BBKPZ33E0,B002IFT1ZA,"~     Jade     ~ ""=^..^=     Queen of Inter...","[60, 73]","I stumbled across this little gem here under my Amazon recommendations.  I'd never even heard of this series of books or the fact it was an HBO show. I read the synopsis and all the reviews here about the show and I was very intrigued.  I like Sean Bean as an actor, and enjoyed Peter Dinklage from Nip/Tuck, and as everyone raved about his performance in this, I thought I'd check out at least one episode.WOW oh WOW.... This series just blew me away!  The storyline was amazing!  All the machinations, assignations, intrigue, deliberations, or stunning confessions that go on are incredible.  The sets and locations are gorgeous.  The theme music is very stirring and the opening credits are creatively done.  I can see why each episode runs a cool $6 mil.... I'm afraid I'll run out of superlatives in describing this show.  There were many times in watching the series where I was shocked and stunned, like ""wow.... Oh my gosh, did that really just happen?"".... You think you may know what's going to happen next, and the show surprises you.  It plays out like an elaborate and intricate game of chess.  I love shows that do that.You may not recogize many of the names, but you'll recognize a lot of the faces.  Mark Addy (Roland from A Knight's Tale, Bill Miller in Still Standing) is wonderful as Robert, king of the seven kingdoms.  Rightfully on the throne?  Some aren't so sure about that.  Eddard (Ned) Stark (excellently played by Sean Bean, Boromir from Lord of the Rings) is Lord of Winterfell and Robert's friend. Ned is asked to come to Kings Landing and accept the job of Hand of the King, due to the recent demise of the previous title holder.  Some whisper assassination.  If that is indeed the case, Ned wants to know why he was killed.Lena Headey (Queen Gorgo in 300) is superb as Robert's wife Cersei Lannister.  Talk about a 180 degree character portrayal from her role in 300.  She was amazing, I loved to hate her. And no one could have played the role of Cersei's brother Tyrion, ""the Imp"" better than Peter Dinklage. He almost steals the show with his performance.  The actors playing two of Ned's younger children are phenomenal, especially Maise Williams as Lord Stark's spunky and scrappy daughter Arya.  This little gal will be a force to be reckoned with in the years to come.  She will definately be one to watch.  Isaac Hempstead Wright plays Arya's brother Bran to perfection.  The actors playing Ned's older children deliver solid performances as well.  Even Natalia Tena (Nyphadora Tonks in Harry Potter) delivers an outstanding performance in a minor role as Osha, a criminal turned new house slave at Winterfell.Then of course, there is the ominous and massive Wall.  Manned for thousands of years, most have forgotton why they even continue to stand the watch, and where deserting your post still means death.  Yet rumors and frightened witnesses swear that monsters and white walkers are beginning to stir, and icy horrors wait beyond the wall. Dragon lore and direwolves are also spoken of.Toss into the mix House Taragaryen across the narrow sea. In exile, Viserys Targaryen desires to take what he feels is his rightful place on the throne in Kings Landing, and sells his sister Daenerys in marriage to the Khal of the fierce and nomadic Dothraki tribe, (think Klingons of the wastelands) so that Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa from Stargate Atlantis) will provide the muscle Viserys needs to get the job done.There are several family dynamics occuring at the same time and it's very involving, so I would refer to IMDB to better understand who was who and where they fit in to the storyline, (thank you IMDB). There is soooooo much more happening than what I've mentioned here, but this review is already getting to be the length of a book itself, so just check it out for yourself.  If you are offended by nudity or violence, this may not be the show for you.Game of Thrones hits the ground running right from the opening credits where you see a white walker, and let me tell you, they're creepy.  This show grabs you and doesn't let go. It's one hell of a ride. I can't wait for the second season.  HBO, you definately have a gem of a winner in this series.

Actually, pretty mad they keep killing the only characters that I liked!  My friend that is obsessed with this show told me it was better than any other shows he had seen. I don't agree. I did not find the show overly sexy or violent as some mention, then again, watchSpartacus: Blood and Sand - The Complete First Seasonfor what I consider maybe too violent and sexy for most.There are some aspects of the show that do live up to the hype and are as good as any of the best shows I've ever watched like:--the locations and scenery were spectacular and fit perfectly for a fantasy story--the technical and image qualities are flawless and really show off Blu-ray.--Tyrion the dwarf probably turns out to give the best and most witty lines I've ever seen. He really surprised me and kept watching just to see what new crazy things he would do or think of! The rest of the characters were pretty predictable and you could pretty much tell what was going to happen to them.--The extras on the disk actually serve a purpose and are very useful. Helps you get a lot more excited about the series if you learn about all the different Houses, characters, and history before starting to watch the series.I would've rated it 5 stars for the above points but the other points I mentioned bring it down.I guess you have to have read the book to really get excited about this series?Maybe that's one reason I didn't care for the show was too much politics and backstabbing for my taste.I guess that's why I like Tyrion so much because he always tried to stay out of it and just wanted to have a good time!I guess I just expected more dragons, wizards, special effects, action etc. because that's what I think of when I think of fantasy. Maybe that will come in later seasons but I never read the books so I wouldn't know?But as it stands I will probably get the 2nd season just because I want to know what happened and the show has an annoying tendency to end with cliffhangers every episode! Actually, this is probably what part of the excitement is with this series for some but the longer you wait to see it the more likely the entire series will be ruined by spoilers because everywhere I go people seem to be talking about what happened on this show!I won't be in a rush to get the 2nd or who knows how many seasons unless the pace picks up and some more magic,dragons, excitement start to show up!I bumped up the review 1 star because it has one of the best quotes I ever came across and one of my favorites now:""a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge""--Tyrion",4,Too slow for my taste,1376956800,"08 20, 2013",2013,2668,"['watching', 'season', '1', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'hype', 'about', 'Actually', 'pretty', 'mad', 'keep', 'killing', 'only', 'characters', 'liked', 'friend', 'obsessed', 'show', 'told', 'was', 'better', 'other', 'shows', 'had', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'show', 'overly', 'sexy', 'violent', 'mention', 'then', 'again', 'watchSpartacus', 'Blood', 'Sand', 'Complete', 'First', 'Seasonfor', 'what', 'consider', 'maybe', 'too', 'violent', 'sexy', 'are', 'aspects', 'show', 'do', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'best', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'locations', 'scenery', 'were', 'spectacular', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'fantasy', 'story', 'technical', 'image', 'qualities', 'are', 'flawless', 'really', 'show', 'off', 'Blu-ray.', 'Tyrion', 'dwarf', 'probably', 'out', 'give', 'best', 'most', 'witty', 'lines', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'really', 'surprised', 'kept', 'watching', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'new', 'crazy', 'things', 'would', 'do', 'think', 'rest', 'characters', 'were', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'could', 'pretty', 'much', 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'them.', 'extras', 'disk', 'actually', 'serve', 'purpose', 'are', 'very', 'useful', 'Helps', 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'excited', 'series', 'learn', 'different', 'Houses', 'characters', 'history', 'starting', 'watch', 'series.I', 'would', ""'ve"", 'rated', '5', 'stars', 'above', 'points', 'other', 'points', 'mentioned', 'bring', 'down.I', 'guess', 'have', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'really', 'get', 'excited', 'series', 'Maybe', 'one', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'show', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'politics', 'backstabbing', 'taste.I', 'guess', 'why', 'like', 'Tyrion', 'so', 'much', 'always', 'tried', 'stay', 'just', 'wanted', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'guess', 'just', 'expected', 'more', 'dragons', 'wizards', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'etc', 'what', 'think', 'when', 'think', 'fantasy', 'will', 'come', 'later', 'seasons', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'probably', 'get', '2nd', 'season', 'just', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'show', 'annoying', 'tendency', 'end', 'cliffhangers', 'episode', 'Actually', 'probably', 'what', 'part', 'excitement', 'series', 'longer', 'wait', 'see', 'more', 'likely', 'entire', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'ruined', 'spoilers', 'everywhere', 'go', 'people', 'seem', 'be', 'talking', 'what', 'happened', 'show', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'rush', 'get', '2nd', 'who', 'how', 'many', 'seasons', 'pace', 'up', 'more', 'magic', 'dragons', 'excitement', 'start', 'show', 'up', 'bumped', 'up', 'review', '1', 'star', 'one', 'best', 'quotes', 'ever', 'came', 'one', 'favorites', 'now', 'mind', 'books', 'sword', 'whetstone', 'keep', 'edge', 'Tyrion']",N/A

Basically you have 3 different kingdoms competing to gain even more power, after one of their kings unexpectedly dies.Politics, alliances, brutality, power-lust, and simple lust and shown in full force here.  Just as HBO did with its ""Rome"" series showing the underbelly of the Roman Empire, so too here we see a mythical medieval realm similar to Lord of the Rings (as least in production design).  But instead of people trying to capture a ring for power, here they do it the old fashioned way, by butchering their enemies, in many novel ways.LOTR alum, Sean Bean, here in perhaps the role he was born to play is brillant; as is the rest of the cast (which is well-cast).  There are many intriguing plot lines that play out, so you the viewer are constantly trying to figure them out to see where they will lead.  In other words, the writing is really good.I've only seen the first handful of episodes, but having seen enough to offer this brief review to HIGHLY recommend it.",4,Sean Bean + HBO = good television,1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,1080,"['brief', 'review', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'books-', 'friend', 'mine', 'did', 'had', 'backstory', 'knowledge', 'Basically', 'have', '3', 'different', 'kingdoms', 'competing', 'gain', 'even', 'more', 'power', 'one', 'kings', 'unexpectedly', 'dies.Politics', 'alliances', 'brutality', 'power-lust', 'simple', 'lust', 'shown', 'full', 'force', 'here', 'Just', 'HBO', 'did', 'Rome', 'series', 'showing', 'underbelly', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'so', 'too', 'here', 'see', 'mythical', 'medieval', 'realm', 'similar', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'least', 'production', 'design', 'instead', 'people', 'trying', 'capture', 'ring', 'power', 'here', 'do', 'old', 'fashioned', 'way', 'butchering', 'enemies', 'many', 'novel', 'ways.LOTR', 'alum', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'here', 'perhaps', 'role', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'brillant', 'rest', 'cast', 'well-cast', 'are', 'many', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'lines', 'play', 'out', 'viewer', 'are', 'constantly', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'see', 'where', 'will', 'lead', 'other', 'words', 'writing', 'really', 'good.I', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'first', 'handful', 'episodes', 'having', 'seen', 'enough', 'offer', 'brief', 'review', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend']",N/A
1269829,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B002IFT1ZA,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[1, 1]","After the free weekend of HBO I just got that played every episode of GAME OF THRONES back to back, I was excited to watch it, being a fan of genre television. I was also a fan of a lot of the people involved, from Sean Bean to Mark Addy to Lena Headey to Peter Dinklage.So, watch it I did, and it was just about everything I hoped it would be: smart, engaging, involving, bawdy, lusty and just the right amount of the fantastical that doesn't take away from the rather gritty realism the show has. In short, the show is addictive, and it almost made me want to subscribe to HBO just to be able to watch it.But after taking the last few days to think about it, I've found some things that I just don't think work as well as they should and maybe it's more revealed in Martin's books but I just have to sound off.I have a great amount of respect for this show. It's done very well. I found myself liking characters I didn't think I'd care about, such as Dani Targaryen and Khal Drogo. I found myself hating characters I thought I'd like, like Littlefinger Baelish (which makes me think, was anyone on THE WIRE American? Not that I care, but I just find it funny with Aidan Gillen, Dominic West and Idris Elba...). But the characters that are a little too one-dimensional are ultimately MOST of The Starks and MOST of the Lannisters. We get to see Catelyn be the loving, doting mother and wife, but once things go all pear-shaped, we get to see her more brutal and vicious side. Ned, Robb, Jon... all the Stark men, really, are men of honor, courage, and virtue. And conversely, other than Tyrion (who is just AWESOME), the Lannisters are unrelenting scumbags with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, with the exception of a few scenes of Cersei's, where we see some of the stone that her heart has become begin to bleed.Don't get me wrong; I'm all for clear heroes and clear villains in a film. But in a film, you only get a few hours at most to develop characters and sometimes, there's too much story to get in the way of adding layers to the characters. Television is a lot different though. You can get more into the thick of the characters. In many ways, television is more about character than it is about action and story, and this was the only way I felt the show fall short.Now, this is just the first season, and with the Lannisters and Starks largely intact, I'm relatively certain we'll see these characters with more dimension and depth. Until then, I want a Direwolf pup really bad.A Lannister always pays his debts, but Winter is coming.

1269833,A2GWA7GB1MTCVO,B002IFT1ZA,Jamison Ballard,"[1, 2]","Game of Thrones, for those that do not know, is based on a novel written by George R.R. Martin, who was proclaimed by Time magazine as the modern day Tolkien.  Being so highly acclaimed it came as no surprise it soon found its way into a film adaptation.  Fantasy has never been one to be very good on film due to its need of a ridiculous budget to make it look well produced versus a B movie from the 80s.  However, I can say without hesitation this is one of the best adapations I have ever seen.Game of Thrones is set in a fantasy world, but it is simply a backdrop to a very human story.  The entire series is character driven, each coming from different cultures, all playing for power to rule on the iron throne.  Violence, sex, love and political intrigue this series has it all.  L.A. Times describes this series as a medieval version of The Sopranos and it comes pretty close to that description.  I will spare you the in depth synopsis since it is complicated to say the least and would only spoil it for anyone viewing this for the first time.  I suggest everyone reading the first book to fully enjoy this series, but if you don't please watch all bonus material that has to do with the characters and setting on these great blu rays before starting episode 1.Game of Thrones Blu Ray set is the definitive way to watch this series.  First, for those that have not read the book can easily get a brief history lesson in the world and the characters that inhabit it.  The Blu Rays are simply put reference quality.  This is a 5 star set with flawless picture quality and an incredibly immersive 5.1 DTS Master HD sound track.  To top it all off you are not simply getting just the episodes which is so common with TV series sets.  You also get this long list of extras as well:- Complete Guide to Westeros - ""An interactive compendium of the noble houses and lands featured in Season One.""- Making ""Game of Thrones"" - ""An exclusive 30-minute feature including never-before-seen footage from the set and  interviews from the cast and crew.""- Character Profiles - ""Profiles of 15 major characters as described by the actors portraying them.""- Creating the Show Open - ""An inside look at the creation of the Emmy-winning opening title sequence for 'Game of Thrones'.""- From the Book to the Screen - ""Executive producers David Benioff & D.B.

There plenty of shocking moments throughout the season to amp up the action and whatnot (honestly, the lack of Whitewalkers after the first episode was rather disappointing, but if that's how it is in the book, then I've just shownm my ignorance, haven't I? ;) as well as to provide extra character-based moments in later episodes.

It is a fantastic series and from what I'm told is pretty faithful to the book, despite the source matierial being a series of 500 plus page books. The best thing about the dvds are the commentatries and making of featurrettes, I'm a film geek and I find all of that stuff fascinating. The ""Pilot"" episode starts out with a hermitically seaed world, with ""The Wall"" after a beheading or 2 (1 of which you see) we then smash cut tothe best opening title sequence in film tv or any other medium that establishes, the world of ""Westeroes"" all other episodes start out with the opening sequence. The pilot episode ends, with a splat. Before all of that though I read ""EW"" where there was a picture of a major character about to be executed, in te picture in the magazie the character is ""blurkled"" out so you don't know who it is, so that was cool, however with their year end 'best of 2011' they went ahead and said who it was, and they did the same thing for ""Breaking Bad"" so we do live in a day and an age where information dispertion is instantaneous, so even if you pick up bits and pieces of things still go ahead and watch ""Game of Thrones"" $30.00 well spent.

It's a visual treat with sets and costumes that fit the books well and the music and introduction are also well done. It's a relief that the actors do a great job as well, even the youngest actors give fine performances. I found Cat and Cersei a little grating but that's no different from the books. If I had a complaint it's that it goes a little overboard with nudity but it's an HBO series and I'm sure they were in favor of this. I'm also sure it will be picked up by a cable network and broadcast without the nudity and possibly with less graphic violence at which time my wife will be willing to watch it. For the most part the series follows the first book very closely including the lively dialogue being nearly the same. The most impressive performances are Sean Bean as Eddard Stark and Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, both capture the characters in the book perfectly. Jack Gleeson's Joffrey is as callow and vicious as in the book and I can't wait to see him suffer his fate in a future season. Sansa is also annoying and vapid and looks a lot like I'd imagined from the book. I'd pictured Arya very differently but Maisie Williams does such an excellent job that now I see her when I read the books which is good. The actors across the Narrow Sea are also amazing, especially Jorah and Dany.*** spoilers ahead *** Dany's vulnerability being replaced by a powerful character is delightful and Iain Glen is perfectly cast and far more enjoyable than Jorah was in the book. Khal Drogo is also perfect and I hated to see him go so soon, much as I hated seeing Eddard's inevitable end - just as I hated these events in the book. George RR Martin is very hard on our favorite characters. Any claims of sexism must come from people who haven't seen or fail to understand the evolution of the female characters. Dany's evolution is one example. Arya and a future character refuse to follow a stereotypical role which is far from sexist. One complaint I do have is that the direwolves haven't become the massive protectors they were in the books. That is probably a practical matter but I wish they'd found a way to use perspective or even CGI to give them the stature of a real direwolf.Forget the criticism, if you ever enjoyed fantasy or historical fiction you should give this show a try.

1269848,A1LCGNI8CRT2GC,B002IFT1ZA,Jean B.,"[5, 6]","I read the book, &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; and was totally disappointed when the author failed to close each storyline (character) with something that resembles what professional writers are expected to do.  I thought I'd borrow the DVD series at the library (did the same for Pillars of the Earth before I purchased it) and was double-disappointed. Maybe I was born too soon for this kind of film but I do like fantasy/science fiction. What I don't like is repetitive sex for the sake of titillation. I find repeated sexual acts beginning a A and ending at Z boring after an hour or so. Giggling sex slaves and prostitutes spreading their legs added nothing to the story line and sure didn't improve the dialog. Both the story and dialog were inconsistent and the transition between locations and characters was clumsy. There were two characters well-acted in the film. The dwarf role actually had something to say and I came to admire the courage he showed in accepting who and what he was. The girl-child who preferred sword fighting to dolls came in a close second. I admired her courage to do what she loved and stick with the training. I've read the other reviews and I think we watched different films and read different books. The violence was way too graphic and the sex/nudity was way too frequent.  Pillars of the Earth presented the same issues but once the tone was set and the reader/watcher knew how crude the times were, the writer got on with the story and it was rewarding and easy to follow. I may be old fashioned but I like to see a little justice for the underdog and I want to good guys to win. Game of Thrones failed on both counts. If I want to see this kind of gratuitous T&A I'll go to a porn site.

HBO has hit another home run with a good series of the kind that always seems to keep them on top of the ratings. This series is every entertaining and the acting is just superb. It contains multiple characters that are carefully developed and you begin to support the character or hate them for their evil and manipulative ways. Each character seems so real and you feel empathy for their problems that they are going through.The show is high action and it contains multiple plots, heroes and villains. The suspense about what is on the other side of the wall is building and I cannot wait to see season two. With the threat of a fierce winter, dragons, white walkers, giants, the wild ones and giant wolves the kingdom is under threat. Can they stop fighting each other and unite to survive or are they their own worst enemy?This show features many outstanding actors and actresses who portray their characters to perfection.

I ponied up the extra buck to watch it in HD, sat back, and prepared to be amazed. Well, I guess I was amazed, but not in the way I expected. This episode falls amazingly short of its potential. There are plenty of elements to grab and hold attention: characters facing tough choices, boys coming of age, a young girl more suited for combat than cross-stitching, mysterious and outrageously evil enemies, etc... I mean, sure those are old stand-bys, and maybe a bit trite, but they work. Production and casting are also quite good. But things quickly go from promising to pathetic.

1269873,A1KRNQWUNCTJS3,B002IFT1ZA,joebobhenrybob,"[3, 23]","HBO you @&$%tards.  Shut up and take my money.  I've been paying AMC for every season of Walking Dead and Breaking Bad and GLADLY.  For all but 1st season of Breaking Bad which I bought the DVDs of, it's been through Amazon Instant watching them the day after they are aired.  I feel like the character in Pretty Woman who says I have all this money and they won't sell me anything.  I got this fistful of dollars and half a year later you still won't take it from me.  It's a big ol upraised middle finger to anyone who bought the 1st season, watched it, appreciated the product and waited with bated breath and a fistful of dollars to support the 2nd season... only to get the ol stiffarm.Generally speaking, I believe artists, actors, writers, directors etc do something useful and meaningful, something worth paying for (even a truly awful movie like Ink I would pay to check out as opposed to pirate), so I don't know that I'm ready to turn pirate now or ever, but there's a point at which I may just write off what I see as a bad business relationship.  There'll be a point at which I say boy that season 1 was great, wonder what happened to them, oh well nevermind time to watch the new Walking Dead and Breaking Bad episodes.  Yeah I got attached to the characters in Game of Thrones, wanted to know what happened to Tyrion, Arya, Snow... but at the end of the day, yknow what, they're fictional characters and if a bus didn't ever arrive on time, if my cellphone kept dropping calls, at the end of the day okay, I can move on and get invested in some other product.  Presumably season 2 would just get me more interested, attached, and frustrated by HBO.  I FOUND game of thrones via Amazon Instant and purchased it there.  Its availability online at all was the reason why I wanted to pay to see season 2, since I am not subscribing to 200+ channels of cable.  In the future, when I shop on Amazon, I will watch to see if a show I am considering purchasing is an HBO show to ensure that I do not hit the buy button and get stuck in a #%&^-tease type situation again.I can visualize the responses to my review based on AVAILABILITY of the product as opposed to the actual quality of the actual product.  So let's talk about the product.  It is a SERIES.  It's an ongoing story.  I rate things on Amazon based not on any artistic merit but on its value as a purchase on Amazon.So starting from that premise I'll tell you... the series is great.  Great production, interesting characters and so on.  I absolutely would love to continue paying to be told the tale in season 2 as I have done with some great AMC series - I use them as an example because they have some great shows and are doing the opposite of HBO.  Most importantly as I said, you are buying into a series here.  Your purchase of season 1 as opposed to the first one or two episodes means you've bought in for the entire story and I am sad to tell you that the story does not stop off at a satisfying point in season 1 but much as you might like to continue watching, HBO does not want your money to follow along with the story and will not let you pay them to continue telling it to you.  Not through Amazon, Netflix, iTunes, etc.  What you're therefore buying into, if you're buying this product, is the frustration of getting into the very beginning of a story, the characters, only to be told yes we have more, no you can't have any. That's the package experience so to speak being offered by HBOBy contrast, AMC has some great selections and is actually interested in letting you pay for them and watch them if they exist.  Mad Men, Hell on Wheels, The Killing, Walking Dead, Breaking Bad... sadly you have to think of what company you're getting involved with prior to purchase.  With HBO or Showtime you may find that becoming a fan means the product exists, you want to buy it, but your money is no good with them.  The show is clearly tailored to play on your emotions such that you are on the edge of your seat for the next episode - normally this would be high praise for a show, but when you take into account what you KNOW they will do to you... had I known, I wouldn't have made the initial purchase.  There are other good shows out there.HBO's business model is to hold back their shows from availability on Amazon and elsewhere.  Therefore, if you watch the occasional cable show via Amazon, definitely reconsider your purchase of this or any HBO show.  If the show has run its course and is available here in its entirety, go for it.  If you subscribe to a cable package and plan to continue doing so, definitely consider watching Game of Thrones although you won't be purchasing it here on Amazon, you'll be going to HBO's on demand web page available only to those who subscribed to a cable package that includes HBO. Due to the absence of GoT season 2, I tried The Killing here on Amazon and found it to be quite gripping and entertaining.  Definitely shop around before you hit that buy button here on Amazon for any HBO show including Game of Thrones.  Sorry, but this frustration is part of what you're buying with your purchase of this product.",1,nevermind,1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,5141,"['HBO', '@', '%', 'tards', 'Shut', 'up', 'take', 'money',

Characters can engage you completely one minute and be dead the next. I love the unpredictability of it all! The thing I am most grateful for is that the makers have done it properly. Castles look like castles. Halls look like medieval halls and there are a host of supporting actors and extras to give a clear sense of the grand sweep of the events. There are no wobbling sets here.

Every other scene in episode one of Game of Thrones had a naked woman in it and a mostly clothed man mounting her like a dog. I've read the books, and I know that this is consistent with Martin's writing, but this kind of information can be implied. The graphic visual is not crucial to the story. In fact, it grinds the story to a halt every time, to the point where it becomes comical.The greatest films leave so much to the imagination, but the cable networks like HBO and Showtime seem to have a fascination with dragging their shows to the borderline of pornography. I suppose the execs at these networks are trying to cash in on a piece of that multi billion dollar industry. I also suspect that many of these execs have sons and daughters. I wonder how proud they would be to see their own children disrobing and simulating (?) graphic sex acts on film for the whole world to see? People are classifying this as an adult fantasy, but I couldn't help imagining the production team of Game of Thrones as a group of pubescent junior high boys sitting around the monitors and giggling about all the naked women in the show.Alternately, The Lord of the Rings is a truly adult fantasy that draws concepts like honor, sacrifice and beauty in much sharper relief. And the irony is that the Lord of the Rings has an even stronger sex appeal than Game of Thrones could ever hope to have because Tolkien was able to employ the art of subtext and the power of suggestion to a greater effect.

1269878,A3F9VH8916IA40,B002IFT1ZA,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[0, 0]","You have to give a hand to HBO for having the guts to take on such a lofty and risky project. Even for a company as successful and well thought of as them, Game of Thrones was no sure thing. Though based on a much loved series, A Song of Ice and Fire by Gorge RR Martin, adapting it to the small screen was an enormous risk. Since Lord of the Rings there hasn't been a live action adaption of a fantasy series as large, as deep, and as populated as this. The world of Westeros is huge, with many incredible locations, a plethora of rich three dimensional characters, large battles, and a unique culture.So how did Game of Thrones match up to the books? Quite well, as a matter of fact. Unlike other TV adaptions of beloved books (looking at you Walking Dead) the writers of Game of Thrones didn't have the hubris or arrogance to think they could out write Gorge Martin and kept the story pretty damned faithful to the original source material. It's astonishing, really, how close the first season follows the first book. Oh, there are differences, slight as they may be, but it always seemed to me that most of these differences were made either because of budget restraints (there are a few battles that are glossed over) or simply in order to better render Martins story on the small screen. All the characters, the major events, the plot twists, the unexpected deaths, are maintained as faithfully as any purest could ask for. Its abundantly clear to me that the writers of this show knew and respected their source material very much. Such loving care is put into bringing the world of Westeros and Essos to life that I could swear Martin was involved in the screen play... oh wait, yes he was.That's probably the biggest strength of Game of Thrones. The integrity of the writing is unmatched in modern television. They don't make the silly mistakes the writers of Walking Dead make, they don't change the characters and their motivations for the sake of one episodes drama, they don't gloss over the more uncomfortable aspects of this world. Westeros is a harsh and unforgiving world, and the show captures that perfectly. Rape, murder, betrayal and murder, none of the horrors of Martins story are pussyfooted in order to appeal to as mass an audience as possible, something that is greatly appreciated not only because it is necessary to tell this story right, but because it must have been a major risk for the studio to produce. When we see Walking Dead stray from its source material to avoid showing rape or torture, I watch Game of Thrones and see those exact elements brought to life as real and uncomfortable for the viewers as they can be. It makes no apologies for these elements, but nor does it flaunt them. Nudity isn't used in this show for shock and awe or titillation as it is in Spartacus, it is merely part of the world and so is shown with such casualness it fades into the background. The same could be said for the violence. For the most part there aren't any long drawn out highly choreographed sword fights that go on forever. They are often very short, to the point, and very bloody. The fight between Ned Stark and Jamie Lannister takes less than thirty seconds, and that's  one of the signature fight scenes of the entire season. Because of this much more time and energy is spent on developing the characters and setting up the conflict between them instead of devoting all their time and money on big action scenes.I guess this is the time where I should talk about what Game of Thrones is about, though every time I try to explain to someone who's never seen it, or read the books, I never quite know how to explain it. Do I say it's a fantasy story like The Lord of the Rings? But that's not quite right, as this is a much more character driven story. To I say it's a character drama? Because that's not quite right either. Westeros is a fictional world where eight families rule over their countries and serve as wardens to King Robert Berathion, who sits on the Iron Throne in Kings Landing. When the Hand of the King, John Aryan dies of under suspicious circumstances, King Robert marches north to Winterfell, the seat of Eddard Stark, the Warden of the North, and Robert's longtime friend, in order to offer the position of Hand to him. Eddard agrees, and returns with the King to Kings Landing. Simultaneously an exiled King Arey's Targaryian has given up his younger sister, Deanary's, to Khal Drogo, the ruler of a vast Mongolian like hoard of Dorthraki in the hopes he can then lead his 30,000 man strong army back to Westeros to reclaim his father's throne.The story moves rather slowly at first, setting up the story and the conflict within it. Not to say any of this is boring, or unnecessary. It isn't until halfway through the season when the conflict between the two competing families, the Starks and the Lannisters, when things start to pick up and the political positioning is replaces by violence. Needless to say, there is a lot going on in this show. Without fantastic writers, and directors who know what they're doing, this could easily have become a wild mess. With so many POV characters playing a vital role in the story as a whole it's hard to given them all the screen time they need to become fleshed out characters while still moving forward at a pace fast enough to keep the audience's attention. Season one is the easiest season to adapt as there are far fewer locations then there will be in following season, and less characters, but even so it must have been very difficult to do. There is no filler, few scenes are wasted, and each character is given room to grow as befitting their status in the books.I haven't even touched on the acting, the effects, the overall look of the show, or the strength of the characters. Needless to say these are all top notch. Every character is portrayed perfectly, from Tyrion Lannister, to Jon Snow, to Eddard Stark and Deanary's Targaryian. If there is one complaint I can give this show, however, it's how rarely they actually show  some of the locations in this show. Granted, with budget restraints they couldn't Lord of the Rings everything, but it would have been nice to get some sweeping shots of Kings Landing, The Erye, Riverrun (which wasn't really shown at all) or Vas Dorthrak. The only location to really got a lot of detail was Winterfell, and it looked amazing. Even for being so briefly show, the locations look fantastic. I just would have liked to see of them.So who would enjoy this show, you ask? Well, if you're not squeamish and the two B's (blood and boobs) don't bother you, I'd recommend this show to, well, anyone. If you're a fan of fantasy, it goes without question you should see it. If you like character drama's, see it. If you like action and battles, you'll get that in season 2, so watch this first. If you like scheming, mystery, and politics, see it. I could not recommend this show enough.Replay value; extremely high.",5,A Faithful Adaption.,1373414400,"07 10, 2013",2013,6963,"['have', 'give', 'hand', 'HBO', 'having', 'guts', 'take', 'lofty',

1269881,AX2KTTU418MII,B002IFT1ZA,Jon Corelis,"[1, 1]","There's so much information available about Game of Thrones that the newcomer to it may feel overwhelmed.  So here's a capsule review intended for  people who have heard of this immensely popular series but have never read the books or seen any episodes, and are wondering if it's worth their while to start watching the DVDs.Game of Thrones is the first book of a heroic fantasy series by American author George R. R. Martin.  The books, like Lord of the Rings, form an extended epic set in a detailed alternative world.  This world is more or less medieval in atmosphere, and includes a certain magical element:  sorcery is effective to a limited extent, and there are actual dragons and other creatures considered legendary in our own world.  The plot concerns the intrigues and wars of various aristocratic families maneuvering for power.The HBO series is considered by most fans of the book to be a faithful adaptation.  It has also been highly and justly praised for its quality as entertainment - personally, I think it is the best television show ever made.  The acting is of a very high quality, with most of the characters being perfectly cast, and the realization of the alternative world in its landscape, architecture, and costume is superb.  And the story is told about as clearly as can be managed with such a complicated plot.  Special effects are used relatively sparingly for this sort of production, but when they are used, they are absolutely convincing.So with all that, what's not to like?  Well, this series, good as it is, isn't for everyone.  For one thing, it pushes the envelope with sex and violence - it doesn't go beyond what's currently considered acceptable in adult TV, but it goes right up to the edge.  And there is plenty of adult language, sometimes of the bluntest kind.  It also is so complicated, with so many characters, and so much backstory presented by references in the current story, that people who haven't read the books may find it difficult to follow at first.  The DVD set has some informational inserts and special features that will help, but many beginning viewers will find they have to beyond those to other information on the internet or in spin-off books in order to sort out who's who and what's happening.  And the story, unlike some other heroic fantasies, is generally not very romantic or whimsical.  There are few unambiguously good characters, many of the ones who seem most positive get killed off, and the overall atmosphere might be described as grim seriousness punctuated with grim humor.Recommendation:  if the characteristics mentioned above don't put you off, by all means watch these DVDs:  you'll probably find yourself rapidly becoming fascinated with them.  But be aware of what you are getting into.  And above all, don't let the fact that these are fantasies which include queens and dragons and sorcerers mislead you into thinking they are suitable for children.  You do not want your kids in the room when these are playing.",5,A review for those wondering if they'd like it,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,3005,"['so', 'much', 'information', 'available', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'newcomer', 'may', 'feel', 'overwhelmed', 'So', 'here', 'capsule', 'review', 'intended', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'heard', 'immensely', 'popular', 'series', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'seen', 'episodes', 'are', 'wondering', 'worth', 'start', 'watching', 'DVDs.Game', 'Thrones', 'first', 'book', 'heroic', 'fantasy', 'series', 'American', 'author', 'George', 'R.', 'R.', 'Martin', 'books', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'form', 'extended', 'epic', 'set', 'detailed', 'alternative', 'world', 'world', 'more', 'less', 'medieval', 'atmosphere', 'certain', 'magical', 'element', 'sorcery', 'effective', 'limited', 'extent', 'are', 'actual', 'dragons', 'other', 'creatures', 'considered', 'legendary', 'own', 'world', 'plot', 'intrigues', 'wars', 'various', 'aristocratic', 'families', 'maneuvering', 'power.The', 'HBO', 'series', 'considered', 'most', 'fans', 'book', 'be', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'also', 'been', 'highly', 'justly', 'praised', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'personally', 'think', 'best', 'television', 'show', 'ever', 'made', 'acting', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'most', 'characters', 'being', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'realization', 'alternative', 'world', 'landscape', 'architecture', 'costume', 'superb', 'story', 'told', 'as', 'clearly', 'can', 'be', 'managed', 'complicated', 'plot', 'Special', 'effects', 'are', 'used', 'relatively', 'sparingly', 'sort', 'production', 'when', 'are', 'used', 'are', 'absolutely', 'convincing.So', 'what', 'not', 'like', 'Well', 'series', 'good', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'one', 'thing', 'envelope', 'sex', 'violence', ""n't"", 'go', 'what', 'currently', 'considered', 'acceptable', 'adult', 'TV', 'right', 'up', 'edge', 'plenty', 'adult', 'language', 'sometimes', 'bluntest', 'kind', 'also', 'so', 'complicated', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'backstory', 'presented', 'references', 'current', 'story', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'may', 'find', 'difficult', 'follow', 'first', 'DVD', 'set', 'informational', 'inserts', 'special', 'features', 'will', 'help', 'many', 'beginning', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'have', 'other', 'information', 'internet', 'spin-off', 'books', 'order', 'sort', 'out', 'who', 'who', 'what', 'happening', 'story', 'other', 'heroic', 'fantasies', 'generally', 'not', 'very', 'romantic', 'whimsical', 'are', 'few', 'unambiguously', 'good', 'characters', 'many', 'ones', 'who', 'seem', 'most', 'positive', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'might', 'be', 'described', 'grim', 'seriousness', 'punctuated', 'grim', 'humor.Recommendation', 'characteristics', 'mentioned', 'above', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'off', 'means', 'watch', 'DVDs', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'rapidly', 'becoming', 'fascinated', 'be', 'aware', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fact', 'are', 'fantasies', 'include', 'queens', 'dragons', 'sorcerers', 'mislead', 'thinking', 'are', 'suitable', 'children', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'kids', 'room', 'when', 'are', 'playing']",N/A

We both enjoyed it as a sort of bloody, sex-filled, As the World Turns-type show. Beyond the hacking, slashing, and whoring what we both noticed was that there were a lot of holes in the show which diminished our enjoyment. Some examples SPOILER ALERT:- In one of the first episodes a boy is hurt while his father is out traveling with the king. Almost immediately after he is hurt, the father appears at the boy's side. We have no way of knowing how his father received word of the injury; he's just suddenly there which feels like a cinematic mistake.- When the main character arrives in his new post as ""King's Hand"" he is asked to make a decision on whether or not a tournament will be held. After quick analysis, he determines it is a waste of money and it should not happen. But then in the following episode or two the tournament is apparently happening. There's no explanation for the sudden change from ""its not going to happen,"" to the tournament actually happening.- The the main character is executed he has hold of essential information about the death of the king and the rise to the thrown of a child who is not actually the heir. I find it odd that upon finding out that he is going to be beheaded, the main characters does not divulge any of this information to the people in attendance and seemingly lets this HUGE secret die with him. Ultimately this makes the main character look like an idiot.There are numerous more holes, unexplained items and so on, that ultimately made Game of Thrones Season 1 less like a fantasy epic and more like a poorly written fantasy daytime soap opera (which can be fun in its own right, but surely not to be taken seriously in the way, of say, Lord of the Rings).",2,Plot Holes and Gaps SPOILER ALERT,1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,1791,"['wife', 'recently', 'finished', 'first', 'season', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'DVD', 'enjoyed', 'sort', 'bloody', 'sex-filled', 'World', 'Turns-type', 'show', 'hacking', 'slashing', 'whoring', 'what', 'noticed', 'was', 'were', 'lot', 'holes', 'show', 'diminished', 'enjoyment', 'examples', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'one', 'first', 'boy', 'hurt', 'father', 'out', 'traveling', 'king', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'hurt', 'father', 'boy', 'side', 'have', 'way', 'knowing', 'how', 'father', 'received', 'word', 'injury', 'just', 'suddenly', 'feels', 'cinematic', 'mistake.-', 'When', 'main', 'character', 'new', 'post', 'King', 'Hand', 'asked', 'make', 'decision', 'not', 'tournament', 'will', 'be', 'held', 'quick', 'analysis', 'waste', 'money', 'should', 'not', 'happen', 'then', 'following', 'episode', 'two', 'tournament', 'apparently', 'happening', 'explanation', 'sudden', 'change', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'tournament', 'actually', 'main', 'character', 'executed', 'hold', 'essential', 'information', 'death', 'king', 'rise', 'thrown', 'child', 'who', 'not', 'actually', 'heir', 'find', 'finding', 'out', 'going', 'be', 'beheaded', 'main', 'characters', 'not', 'divulge', 'information', 'people', 'attendance', 'seemingly', 'HUGE', 'secret', 'die', 'Ultimately', 'main', 'character', 'look', 'idiot.There', 'are', 'numerous', 'more', 'holes', 'unexplained', 'items', 'so', 'ultimately', 'made', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'Season', '1', 'less', 'fantasy', 'epic', 'more', 'poorly', 'written', 'fantasy', 'daytime', 'soap', 'opera', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'own', 'right', 'surely', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'way', 'say', 'Lord', 'Rings']",N/A

Martin for a number of years, but had not (and still have not) read his ""Games of Thrones"" series, or any of his other books for that matter. I had nothing against him and I rather like fantasy with K Gabriel Kay being one of my favourite authors. It is simply that I had too many other books to read and had never, up to now, taken the time and trouble to start with Games of Thrones. On Friday 14 June, I bought Season 1, at least. The next day, at 5 pm, I watched the first episode, and the next nine followed in quick succession, giving you an idea at when time I finished and to what extent I got hooked in. Since then, I have made up for my ""error"" and all of the books have just arrived...Since I am not yet part of the absolute fans, and haven't yet read the books, I cannot assess to what extent the series mirror the books. However, as you will have guessed, they are rather entertaining - it is very hard to stop in the middle of an episode and grab something to eat, for instance.Another strongpoint is that this is yet another series from HBO, which I have enjoyed just as much as the previous ones (the two Rome series, in particular). Arguably, HBO series tend to lean on the ""realistic"" side and may not be for the ""faint hearted"": the fights and stories tend to be gory and full of sex. This was not a problem for me and it is hardly surprising for a fantasy story set in a world that seems to have borrowed many of its features from the fourteenth century in Europe.A third element which I very much liked was some of the book's features, such as the huge Wall - loosely inspired by Hadrian's Wall and the Great Wall of China - that separate the continent inhabited by the humans from the far north where all sorts of creatures lurk, each one more deadly and horrible than the next. Another of these nice touches was the crows used to carry messages across the continent, allowing the contended great Houses to keep abreast of what may happening a couple of thousand of leagues away.Then, of course, there are the actors. My initial expectations here were rather low, with the exception of Sean Bean, who was just as good as I expected him to be in the role of Eddard Stark, Warden of the North. I was agreeably surprised by some of the other characters, especially the four main Lannisters (the father, his daughter the Queen, and his two sons) and King Robert Barratheon. I also liked the performance of the actor playing Lady Catelynn. I less liked some of the other performances, such as Daenerys for instance, but none were unbearable or absolute drivel.I am waiting with some trepidation for season 2 to come out in Europe. I wonder if it will be as good since some of my favourite actors will no longer be part of it. Meanwhile, I'll go through Martin's books and since the smallest of these is 500 pages and the average size is more like 750, this should keep me patient for a little while...Addendum on 4 July: I have just finished Game of Thrones (the book), which I found excellent. The series is remarkably faifhtful to the book itself, with only a few things left out, such as the two brothers of King Robert Barratheon. While Lord Stannis is only mentioned ans does not appear in the book, Lord Renly does, even if briefly. Reading the book after having seen the series has reinforced my initial impressions and assessment. Four additional actors which I did not mention initially and who seemed to correspond rather well to their characters in the book as those playing the roles of the devious Lord Barrish (Littlefinger) and of Varys the eunuch, of Prince (and then King) Joffrey, rather good in his role of a cruel, mean and spoilt little twerp, and of Sandor Clegane (the Hound).",5,I got hooked in...,1340496000,"06 24, 2012",2012,3747,"['have', 'heard', 'George', 'R.R', 'Martin', 'number', 'years', 'had', 'not', 'still', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Games', 'Thrones', 'series', 'other', 'books', 'matter', 'had', 'nothing', 'rather', 'fantasy', 'K', 'Gabriel', 'Kay', 'being', 'one', 'favourite', 'authors', 'simply', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'books', 'read', 'had', 'never', 'up', 'now', 'taken', 'time', 'trouble', 'start', 'Games', 'Thrones', 'Friday', '14', 'June', 'bought', 'Season', '1', 'least', 'next', 'day', '5', 'pm', 'watched', 'first', 'episode', 'next', 'nine', 'followed', 'quick', 'succession', 'giving', 'idea', 'when', 'time', 'finished', 'what', 'extent', 'got', 'hooked', 'then', 'have', 'made', 'up', 'error', 'books', 'have', 'just', 'arrived', 'am', 'not', 'yet', 'part', 'absolute', 'fans', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'read', 'books', 'can', 'not', 'assess', 'what', 'extent', 'series', 'books', 'However', 'will', 'have', 'guessed', 'are', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'very', 'hard', 'stop', 'middle', 'episode', 'grab', 'something', 'eat', 'instance.Another', 'strongpoint', 'yet', 'series', 'HBO', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'previous', 'ones', 'two', 'Rome', 'series', 'particular', 'Arguably', 'HBO', 'series', 'tend', 'lean', 'realistic', 'side', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'faint', 'hearted', 'fights', 'stories', 'tend', 'be', 'gory', 'full', 'sex', 'was', 'not', 'problem', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'fantasy', 'story', 'set', 'world', 'have', 'borrowed', 'many', 'features', 'fourteenth', 'century', 'Europe.A', 'third', 'element', 'very', 'much', 'liked', 'was', 'book', 'features', 'such', 'huge', 'Wall', 'loosely', 'inspired', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'Great', 'Wall', 'China', 'separate', 'continent', 'inhabited', 'humans', 'far', 'north', 'where', 'sorts', 'creatures', 'lurk', 'one', 'more', 'deadly', 'horrible', 'next', 'nice', 'touches', 'was', 'crows', 'used', 'carry', 'messages', 'continent', 'allowing', 'contended', 'great', 'Houses', 'keep', 'abreast', 'what', 'may', 'happening', 'couple', 'thousand', 'leagues', 'away.Then', 'course', 'are', 'actors', 'initial', 'expectations', 'here', 'were', 'rather', 'low', 'exception', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'expected', 'be', 'role', 'Eddard', 'Stark', 'Warden', 'North', 'was', 'agreeably', 'surprised', 'other', 'characters', 'especially', 'four', 'main', 'Lannisters', 'father', 'daughter', 'Queen', 'two', 'sons', 'King', 'Robert', 'Barratheon', 'also', 'liked', 'performance', 'actor', 'playing', 'Lady', 'Catelynn', 'less', 'liked', 'other', 'performances', 'such', 'Daenerys', 'instance', 'none', 'were', 'unbearable', 'absolute', 'drivel.I', 'am', 'waiting', 'trepidation', 'season', '2', 'come', 'out', 'Europe', 'wonder', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'favourite', 'actors', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'part', 'Meanwhile', ""'ll"", 'go', 'Martin', 'books', 'smallest', '500', 'pages', 'average', 'size', 'more', '750', 'should', 'keep', 'patient', 'little', 'while', 'Addendum', '4', 'July', 'have', 'just', 'finished', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'book', 'found', 'excellent', 'series', 'remarkably', 'faifhtful', 'book', 'only', 'few', 'things', 'left', 'out', 'such', 'two', 'brothers', 'King', 'Robert', 'Barratheon', 'Lord', 'Stannis', 'only', 'mentioned', 'ans', 'not', 'appear', 'book', 'Lord', 'Renly', 'even', 'briefly', 'Reading', 'book', 'having', 'seen', 'series', 'reinforced', 'initial', 'impressions', 'assessment', 'Four', 'additional', 'actors', 'did', 'not', 'mention', 'initially', 'who', 'seemed', 'correspond', 'rather', 'well', 'characters', 'book', 'playing', 'roles', 'devious', 'Lord', 'Barrish', 'Littlefinger', 'Varys', 'eunuch', 'Prince', 'then', 'King', 'Joffrey', 'rather', 'good', 'role', 'cruel', 'mean', 'spoilt', 'little', 'twerp', 'Sandor', 'Clegane', 'Hound']",N/A

1269895,AFRZL05D54MPM,B002IFT1ZA,JWolf,"[2, 2]","Game of Thrones is HBOs television series based on George R R Martin's series, The Song of Ice and Fire. The episodes take place on the fictional continent of Westeros, separated by the Narrow Sea. The season begins, for the most part, in Winterfell which is one of the seven kingdoms under the reign of King Robert Barrathian (current occupier of the iron throne), who resides in the capital, King's Landing, to the south.  Winterfell, the furthest north of the kingdoms, is under the command of Lord Ned Stark, the king's most trusted friend who fought by his side when he took the iron throne.The first few episodes are focused in Winterfell so that the large cast may be introduced slowly; several story lines branch from here and run parallel through the remainder of the series, often crossing paths. Ned Stark and his wife, familiarly known as Cat, have three sons and two daughters, though Ned also has a son named Jon Snow from an affair he had during the war for the iron throne. Jon joins his uncle, Ned's brother, in the Night's Watch on The Wall, a barrier between the kingdoms and what lies beyond. The Wall is north of Winterfell and beyond it is a wintery wasteland occupied by ""wildlings"" as well as legendary zombie-like beings. The Night's Watch serves to protect Westeros from the terrors north of The Wall.In Winterfell, the Starks soon learn of the death of Jon Arryn, the hand of the King and Lady Stark's brother-in-law. The King and his family inform the Starks they will be coming to Winterfell, but the Starks know the only reason for the trip is that Robert will ask Ned to fill the position of king's hand.  Upon the royal arrival, we are introduced to the queen and her brothers of the Lannister family; one is her twin, known as King slayer (because he was who stabbed the previous king when Robert took the throne), the other is called the imp because he is a dwarf. The Lannister family is the wealthiest in Westeros, but the Starks soon learn they are not to be trusted.The remainder of the season is split between dealings in Winterfell, King's Landing, The Vale, and the whereabouts of the two surviving Tarrgarians. The Tarrgarians are recognized by their silvery hair and were the previous holders of the iron throne, when it was taken, only two of the children survived and now plot their way home from their current position across the narrow sea. The girl, Danarys Tarrgarian, is forced to wed Khal Drogo, leader of the Dothraki, a savage clan. The marriage is forced by her brother in hope that the Dothraki will lend him the power to cross the narrow sea and take back his homeland. Danarys learns to love her new husband and his people; she is pregnant with Khal's son.I have chosen to end my synopsis here in effort not to spoil too much, but the series itself is essentially a fictional history set in somewhat medieval times, though far more glamorous. The plot and it's subplots do a remarkable job of engaging viewers as well as invoking suspense. I began watching the series because I had heard of its popularity, though I wasn't initially captivated. I soon, however, found myself constantly thinking about it and what would happen next and feel pretty empty when I run out of episodes.",5,Addictive,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,3237,"['Game', 'Thrones', 'HBOs', 'television', 'series', 'based', 'George', 'R', 'R', 'Martin', 'series', 'Song', 'Ice', 'Fire', 'episodes', 'take', 'place', 'fictional', 'continent', 'Westeros', 'separated', 'Narrow', 'Sea', 'season', 'most', 'part', 'Winterfell', 'one', 'seven', 'kingdoms', 'reign', 'King', 'Robert', 'Barrathian', 'current', 'occupier', 'iron', 'throne', 'who', 'capital', 'King', 'Landing', 'south', 'Winterfell', 'furthest', 'north', 'kingdoms', 'command', 'Lord', 'Ned', 'Stark', 'king', 'most', 'trusted', 'friend', 'who', 'fought', 'side', 'when', 'took', 'iron', 'throne.The', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'focused', 'Winterfell', 'large', 'cast', 'may', 'be', 'introduced', 'slowly', 'several', 'story', 'lines', 'branch', 'here', 'run', 'parallel', 'remainder', 'series', 'often', 'crossing', 'paths', 'Ned', 'Stark', 'wife', 'familiarly', 'known', 'Cat', 'have', 'three', 'sons', 'two', 'daughters', 'though', 'Ned', 'also', 'son', 'named', 'Jon', 'Snow', 'affair', 'had', 'war', 'iron', 'throne', 'Jon', 'uncle', 'Ned', 'brother', 'Night', 'Watch', 'Wall', 'barrier', 'kingdoms', 'what', 'Wall', 'north', 'Winterfell', 'wintery', 'wasteland', 'occupied', 'wildlings', 'as', 'well', 'legendary', 'zombie-like', 'beings', 'Night', 'Watch', 'protect', 'Westeros', 'terrors', 'north', 'Wall.In', 'Winterfell', 'Starks', 'soon', 'learn', 'death', 'Jon', 'Arryn', 'hand', 'King', 'Lady', 'Stark', 'brother-in-law', 'King', 'family', 'inform', 'Starks', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'Winterfell', 'Starks', 'know', 'only', 'reason', 'trip', 'Robert', 'will', 'ask', 'Ned', 'fill', 'position', 'king', 'hand', 'royal', 'arrival', 'are', 'introduced', 'queen', 'brothers', 'Lannister', 'family', 'one', 'twin', 'known', 'King', 'slayer', 'was', 'who', 'stabbed', 'previous', 'king', 'when', 'Robert', 'took', 'throne', 'other', 'called', 'imp', 'dwarf', 'Lannister', 'family', 'wealthiest', 'Westeros', 'Starks', 'soon', 'learn', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'trusted.The', 'remainder', 'season', 'split', 'dealings', 'Winterfell', 'King', 'Landing', 'Vale', 'whereabouts', 'two', 'surviving', 'Tarrgarians', 'Tarrgarians', 'are', 'recognized', 'silvery', 'hair', 'were', 'previous', 'holders', 'iron', 'throne', 'when', 'was', 'taken', 'only', 'two', 'children', 'survived', 'now', 'plot', 'way', 'home', 'current', 'position', 'narrow', 'sea', 'girl', 'Danarys', 'Tarrgarian', 'forced', 'wed', 'Khal', 'Drogo', 'leader', 'Dothraki', 'savage', 'clan', 'marriage', 'forced', 'brother', 'hope', 'Dothraki', 'will', 'lend', 'power', 'cross', 'narrow', 'sea', 'take', 'back', 'homeland', 'Danarys', 'love', 'new', 'husband', 'people', 'pregnant', 'Khal', 'son.I', 'have', 'chosen', 'end', 'synopsis', 'here', 'effort', 'not', 'spoil', 'too', 'much', 'series', 'essentially', 'fictional', 'history', 'set', 'somewhat', 'medieval', 'times', 'far', 'more', 'glamorous', 'plot', 'subplots', 'do', 'remarkable', 'job', 'engaging', 'viewers', 'as', 'well', 'invoking', 'suspense', 'began', 'watching', 'series', 'had', 'heard', 'popularity', 'was', ""n't"", 'initially', 'captivated', 'soon', 'however', 'found', 'constantly', 'thinking', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'feel', 'pretty', 'empty', 'when', 'run', 'out', 'episodes']",N/A

1269899,A2A7XY78RAM5H5,B002IFT1ZA,"Karl E. Weaver ""karlweaver""","[0, 0]","Almost all the reviews of Game of Thrones have been very positive.  Written by those who have gobbled it up.  My review is tentative as I've only gotten through the first 2.5 shows so far, and I didn't read the books.  I read that the writer loved J. R. R. Tolkien's works [a plus for me, but it's extremely difficult for anyone else to match the quality of Tolkien's main work] so I am not able to comment on the original writing in the books.As for the show: The acting so far is very good.  The cinematography is very good.  Costuming and integration of real with CG elements so far is spectacular.  About the story?  Yes most of the characters are self-centered, manipulative, deceptive, untrustworthy.  In that sense it's like a lot of history, but in a fantasy setting.  As for the fantasy: SO FAR, little is in evidence.  One sees that apparently dragons are going to appear at some point, and there are vague &#34;white walkers&#34; and strange things beyond a high wall, protecting the civilized areas.  Something not immediately apparent in very brief reviews: if this world were real, it must have had a highly elliptical orbit.  Summers last for many decades.  Winters can last an entire lifetime.  As the story starts, summer is beginning to change to winter.  Kids and young men who have known nothing but summer are in for a rude awakening.  The elderly remember, or at least they know the stories.To be hooked on a story one must sympathise with at least some characters.  The focus initially is on the Stark family, who rule the northern of 7 centers of power.  Interestingly the father is first seen in a harsh light, executing a man some would think deserved some mercy.  But he tells his son, &#34;It's important to carry out a decree you order.&#34;  [Presumably so you can witness the ugly consequences, and know the implications].  In his world rules are rules and can't be bent, for the protection of everyone.  As we later watch his interaction with his family I felt sympathetic to all of them [which I suppose means they won't do well...]Yes there is some nudity and there is some violence, though so far neither full frontal nudity, nor gratuitously graphic violence.

1269903,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B002IFT1ZA,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[25, 45]","Please note: As of thiis date, May 17, it turns out that I haven't been able to do weekly updates, primarily because this review would become unwieldy. I think you'll find that the descriptions of the episodes included here should be enough to decide whether this is worth watching. My conclusion? Yes, although I'm finding significant differences in the apparent ages and characterizations of some of the people - compared to the book.When I started this review, only the first episode had aired and I've continued to update this review - up to a point - and plan to do a summary of the overall series eventually.This series is based on the first of four books in the George RR. Martin series, Game of Thrones. Other titles are A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, A Feast for Crows, etc (see link below). The corruption and betrayal that will ensue between the Stark and Lannister families is obvious - although the full details are, of course, yet to be revealed. Movie adaptations of books have their pros and cons and this series - so far- is no exception. Clearly, plenty of money has been spent to create a realistic sense of the time and place. You can almost feel the chill in the air and the sense of danger is palpable from the start. It does not take long for graphic violence and sex to appear.After seeing the first episode, I went back and reread part of the book and that episode did stay true to the events in the book that were covered so far. For those unfamiliar with the book, it could be confusing to keep track of the various families. Also, the television version is quite graphic when it comes to sexuality and violence. This is not a family friendly series but then...would anyone familiar with the books expect it to be?The setting and political intrigues between the various noble families is clear. The tight script and editing made the sex scenes stand out while the depth of the novel and character descriptions took second place. But the first episode was still very riveting and I'm eager to see how the series progresses.George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones 4-Book Boxed Set: A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, and A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire).Update: As the series proceeds, as might be expected, tensions increase and loyalties are tested. Young Bran remains in a coma, with his life hanging in the balance. By the end of the latest episode (thus far), keep an eye on Bran. Again, plenty of graphic nudity combined with cruelty. And of course details from the book have either been tightened or eliminated (how on earth could a series capture the vivid descriptions of the author?) So I've downgraded my expectations somewhat.Kudos do have to go to the producers and directors of the HBO series for allowing each character to be introduced and evolve, perhaps a major aid to those unfamiliar with the book.But back to the series....Jon Snow, the ""bastard son"" is off to join the Night's Watch. Ned also leaves while Dany (Daenerys) is taught the sexual techniques which she hopes will please her new husband. There are hints that their relationship has the potential to grow deeper, although that is far from certain as the episode ends. Because I'm working hard not to include too many spoilers, I'll only add that some viewers may find at least one death in this episode to be distressing while another is not unexpected.Catelyn continues to reject Jon as she remains by Bran's side. But she can't prevent Jon from showing his affection for Bran before he leaves. The teenager, Joffrey, appears to be wooing Sansa Stark successfully - until they run into Anya, fencing with the butcher's boy. Joffrey bullies and taunts the boy and things come to a distressing climax (again, trying to prevent spoilers). Meanwhile, the direwolfs are proving to be more than just pets, with far greater insight and power than imagined. There is a very touching scene involving one of them as well as a painful event with another.At several points, the Dragon's Eggs are shown, building momentum. This time around, I watched with a friend who hadn't read the book. He was completely hooked by the end of the episode. Again, would love to hear others' take on the show so far. These are only brief recaps of each episode and I can't include every crucial plot development or this review will soon become far too long. I hope I've included enough to intrigue you.",4,Will try to update review as each episode appears,1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,4419,"['Please', 'note', 'thiis', 'date', 'May', '17', 'out', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'do', 'weekly', 'updates', 'primarily', 'review', 'would', 'become', 'unwieldy', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'descriptions', 'episodes', 'included', 'here', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'decide', 'worth', 'watching', 'conclusion', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'finding', 'significant', 'differences', 'apparent', 'ages', 'characterizations', 'people', 'compared', 'book.When', 'started', 'review', 'only', 'first', 'episode', 'had', 'aired', ""'ve"", 'continued', 'update', 'review', 'up', 'point', 'plan', 'do', 'summary', 'overall', 'series', 'eventually.This', 'series', 'based', 'first', 'four', 'books', 'George', 'RR', 'Martin', 'series', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'Other', 'titles', 'are', 'Clash', 'Kings', 'A', 'Storm', 'Swords', 'A', 'Feast', 'Crows', 'etc', 'see', 'link', 'corruption', 'betrayal', 'will', 'ensue', 'Stark', 'Lannister', 'families', 'obvious', 'full', 'details', 'are', 'course', 'yet', 'be', 'revealed', 'Movie', 'adaptations', 'books', 'have', 'pros', 'cons', 'series', 'far-', 'exception', 'Clearly', 'plenty', 'money', 'been', 'spent', 'create', 'realistic', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'chill', 'air', 'sense', 'danger', 'palpable', 'start', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'graphic', 'violence', 'sex', 'appear.After', 'seeing', 'first', 'episode', 'went', 'back', 'reread', 'part', 'book', 'episode', 'did', 'stay', 'true', 'events', 'book', 'were', 'covered', 'so', 'far', 'unfamiliar', 'book', 'could', 'be', 'confusing', 'keep', 'track', 'various', 'families', 'Also', 'television', 'version', 'quite', 'graphic', 'when', 'sexuality', 'violence', 'not', 'family', 'friendly', 'series', 'then', 'would', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'books', 'expect', 'be', 'setting', 'political', 'intrigues', 'various', 'noble', 'families', 'clear', 'tight', 'script', 'editing', 'made', 'sex', 'scenes', 'stand', 'out', 'depth', 'novel', 'character', 'descriptions', 'took', 'second', 'place', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'riveting', ""'m"", 'eager', 'see', 'how', 'series', 'progresses.George', 'R.', 'R.', 'Martin', 'A', 'Game', 'Thrones', '4-Book', 'Boxed', 'Set', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'A', 'Clash', 'Kings', 'A', 'Storm', 'Swords', 'Feast', 'Crows', 'A', 'Song', 'Ice', 'Fire', '.Update', 'series', 'proceeds', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'tensions', 'increase', 'loyalties', 'are', 'tested', 'Young', 'Bran', 'coma', 'life', 'hanging', 'balance', 'end', 'latest', 'episode', 'thus', 'far', 'keep', 'eye', 'Bran', 'Again', 'plenty', 'graphic', 'nudity', 'combined', 'cruelty', 'course', 'details', 'book', 'have', 'been', 'tightened', 'eliminated', 'how', 'earth', 'could', 'series', 'capture', 'vivid', 'descriptions', 'author', ""'ve"", 'downgraded', 'expectations', 'somewhat.Kudos', 'do', 'have', 'go', 'producers', 'directors', 'HBO', 'series', 'allowing', 'character', 'be', 'introduced', 'evolve', 'perhaps', 'major', 'aid', 'unfamiliar', 'book.But', 'back', 'series', '.Jon', 'Snow', 'bastard', 'son', 'join', 'Night', 'Watch', 'Ned', 'also', 'Dany', 'Daenerys', 'taught', 'sexual', 'techniques', 'will', 'please', 'new', 'husband', 'are', 'hints', 'relationship', 'potential', 'grow', 'deeper', 'far', 'certain', 'episode', ""'m"", 'working', 'hard', 'not', 'include', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'only', 'add', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'least', 'one', 'death', 'episode', 'be', 'distressing', 'not', 'unexpected.Catelyn', 'reject', 'Jon', 'Bran', 'side', 'ca', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'Jon', 'showing', 'affection', 'Bran', 'teenager', 'Joffrey', 'be', 'wooing', 'Sansa', 'Stark', 'successfully', 'run', 'Anya', 'fencing', 'butcher', 'boy', 'Joffrey', 'bullies', 'boy', 'things', 'come', 'distressing', 'climax', 'again', 'trying', 'prevent', 'spoilers', 'Meanwhile', 'direwolfs', 'are', 'proving', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'pets', 'far', 'greater', 'insight', 'power', 'imagined', 'very', 'touching', 'scene', 'involving', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'painful', 'event', 'another.At', 'several', 'points', 'Dragon', 'Eggs', 'are', 'shown', 'building', 'momentum', 'time', 'watched', 'friend', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'was', 'completely', 'hooked', 'end', 'episode', 'Again', 'would', 'love', 'hear', 'others', 'take', 'show', 'so', 'far', 'are', 'only', 'brief', 'recaps', 'episode', 'ca', ""n't"", 'include', 'crucial', 'plot', 'development', 'review', 'will', 'soon', 'become', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'hope', ""'ve"", 'included', 'enough', 'intrigue']",N/A

However, this story lacks irony and true character development (they're all ""ordinary joes"", which is supposed to make them identifiable-meaning they don't have true swings of temperment, ambitions, anything...) I don't care that that one is a king and this one is a little boy who is crippled for life because of an attempt on his life, or another is a car salesman from Toledo. There is never any doubt what any one of them is going to do. I can honestly say that after 2 episodes, that I know for certain that the aforementioned boy will somehow wreak violent revenge on the guy who pushed him off the tower-but only after much time (and viewer patience) has passed, and only for the death of his dad, which I foresee... I know the sister sold as a bride will wreak violent revenge on everybody for the death of her husband with the eyeliner. Yeah, I haven't seen the episode where he dies, but I'm quite certain he will. The car salesman from Toledo will have sex with somebody that is considered sexy because it's somehow violent itself (it's a rape, or it's incest, or something else gross). Then the salesman will plot dire revenge (which will only be death) against somebody for doing the very same thing he did. I envision more tournament battles amongst two characters to the death. I envision the discovery of many creatures that never play a significant part in the development of the plot, but will somehow be the deciding factor in some epic finale. (Maybe the white walker thingie? Or will the white walker thingies be a persecuted minority?) Anyway, after I post this, I'm gonna Wikipedia the series to see how many of these predictions were true.

1269910,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B002IFT1ZA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1082, 1162]","Few shows have been more eagerly awaited than the arrival of HBO's adaptation of George R.R. Martin's masterful and massive epic ""Game of Thrones"" (the first in a series).  As the books have progressed, however, faithful followers have cried foul as promises have yet to be delivered.  But no matter where you stand in that controversy, there is little debate to the majesty and quality of the novel ""Thrones""--an almost instant classic in the adult fantasy genre.  Multi-layered and ambitious, this sprawling tale charts a powerful story of intrigue, political machinations, and violence amidst the brutal landscape of a nation divided.  It is not a production you could approach half-heartedly.  To do justice to the novel's intricacies required a massive cast, extensive period sets and costumes, lavish effects and a focused and intelligent screenplay.  Well, creators David Benioff (a top notch novelist himself--check out City of Thieves) and D.B. Weiss were up to the challenge and the astute HBO has once again backed a winner.  Make no mistake, this is no cheesy kid's story--this is dark and relentless entertainment for people who enjoy quality programming.At the heart of ""Game of Thrones"" is the Stark family.  Living in relative isolation, patriarch Sean Bean is called to assist the King when a vacancy opens up due to suspect causes.  Suspicions have fallen on the King's wife (Lena Headley) and her twin brother (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), and there may be further nefarious acts in store for His Royal Highness.  When the Stark's young son witnesses something he should not have, a violent act that will have long range repercussions occurs.  This, however, is just the jumping off point for a tale with numerous dimensions.  There are the exiled Targaryen siblings, a brother and sister who have a claim to the throne and hope to retake the power seat by aligning with a barbaric and powerful tribe of warriors.  Bean's illegitimate son figures prominently as well, as a guardian on The Wall preparing for imminent danger.  There are so many other peripheral characters and story lines, it would be impossible to delineate them all concisely.  There are assassination plots, vigilante justice, court intrigue, various sexual escapades, vicious barbarism, unseen monstrosities, plenty of wolves, family drama, and a dragon egg or two.Through it all, there is a recurrent theme that ""Winter is Coming""--a threat that poses a menace and a danger that may be unavoidable.  This show is not for the faint of heart, and should only be considered for age appropriate audiences.  As an HBO production, the screenplay doesn't shy away from the gritty violence that this time period and life style would necessitate.  I, for one, appreciate the authentic feel to the drama.  This show is also not for the casual viewer.  It unfolds at its own pace, much like a good novel.  It requires both patience and attention to really appreciate just how sophisticated and complex this tale is.  It is a grown-up and smart piece!The show looks absolutely fantastic.  Technical aspects of the production are as good, or better, than any comparable feature film.  The cast is also uniformly excellent.  It would be impossible, again, to highlight everyone in the cast that deserves a special mention--so I'll limit my accolades to Peter Dinklage.  As Tyrion Lannister (the black sheep brother of Headley and Coster-Waldau), Dinklage steals just about every scene that he is in.  Funny, sardonic, and wise--this Imp (as he's called) has a terrific knack of putting things into perspective.  Dinklage has had many great roles in his life--but this is a performance of true star wattage.  Don't be surprised to see him invited to the Emmy race for Best Supporting Actor! He is one of the best things in this great presentation.  I truly admire and recommend ""Game of Thrones"" because it never panders.

Yes, there are some outstanding performances by some of the leading actors:Mark Addy is terrific in the role of Robert Baratheon, a once heroic king who has become overweight and buffoonish in middle age and is plagued by an unhappy marriage. Maisie Williams, who plays my favorite character in the books, Arya, is an absolute scene stealer -- she is exactly how I envisioned the character of Arya, scrappy and adorable with those huge eyes of hers. And of course Peter Dinklage is terrific as Tyrion Lannister, the deformed but cunning black sheep of the Lannister family. There are also some reasonably good performances from Michele Fairley (Catelyn Stark), Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), Richard Madden (Robb Stark) and Emilia Clarke (Danys Targearean). Unfortunatley, thats were the good performances end, and we haven't quite covered all the main characters yet. I'm not sure what happened to Sean Bean since the Lord of the Rings, but whatever happened, it isnt good. He looks old, tired, and distracted in the role of Ned Stark. He is not able to hold is own in scenes with Robert Baratheon (and he is supposed to be the great King's most trusted and loyal ally), he cannot hold is own is scenes with his wife, Catelyn Stark. I'm as big a fan of Sean Bean as there is -- I loved him in the Tom Clancy movie Patriot Games, and he was great as Boromir in LOTOR, but wow was he miscast for this series. Another huge letdown is Lena Headley as Cersei Lannister. Headley is a magnificent looking woman, as Cersei is in the books, but that's where the resemblance ends. Were Cersei is cruel, calculating and fiendishly cunning in the series, Headley actually has this strange look of COMPASSION (of all things) in her eyes most of the time. And where Cersei is a force of nature in the books, screaming and cursing her contempt at wretched brother Tyrion, or arduously flirting with her beloved brother Jaime, Headly is a drooping lilly in this series -- her voice is barely above a whisper most of the time! She gets overwhelmed in scenes with Mark Addy, Peter Dinklage, even Michele Fairley as Catelyn Stark proves too much for her. The same criticism applies to Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in the role of Jaime Lannister. Again, Nikolaj looks the part of Jaime, handsome and roguish. But where Jaime is a dashing, daring, risk-seeking warrior in the books, Nikolaj comes across as some stuffy academic, more comfortable poring over tomes in some library by his lonesome rather than baring steel on the battlefield.I would recommnend a viewing if you are a fan of the books, but, as a result of some of the tepid performances by some of the cast members, dont expect many repeat viewings!",3,Not nearly as good as the books,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,2824,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'consumers', 'Amazon', 'critics', 'net', 'are', 'giving', 'series', 'such', 'glowing', 'reviews.The', 'acting', 'really', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Yes', 'are', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'leading', 'actors', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'terrific', 'role', 'Robert', 'Baratheon', 'once', 'heroic', 'king', 'who', 'become', 'overweight', 'buffoonish', 'middle', 'age', 'plagued', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'Maisie', 'Williams', 'who', 'favorite', 'character', 'books', 'Arya', 'absolute', 'scene', 'stealer', 'exactly', 'how', 'envisioned', 'character', 'Arya', 'scrappy', 'adorable', 'huge', 'eyes', 'hers', 'course', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'terrific', 'Tyrion', 'Lannister', 'deformed', 'cunning', 'black', 'sheep', 'Lannister', 'family', 'are', 'also', 'reasonably', 'good', 'performances', 'Michele', 'Fairley', 'Catelyn', 'Stark', 'Sophie', 'Turner', 'Sansa', 'Stark', 'Richard', 'Madden', 'Robb', 'Stark', 'Emilia', 'Clarke', 'Danys', 'Targearean', 'Unfortunatley', 'thats', 'were', 'good', 'performances', 'end', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'covered', 'main', 'characters', 'yet', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'happened', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'happened', 'isnt', 'good', 'old', 'tired', 'distracted', 'role', 'Ned', 'Stark', 'not', 'able', 'hold', 'own', 'scenes', 'Robert', 'Baratheon', 'supposed', 'be', 'great', 'King', 'most', 'trusted', 'loyal', 'ally', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'own', 'scenes', 'wife', 'Catelyn', 'Stark', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'loved', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'movie', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'was', 'great', 'Boromir', 'LOTOR', 'wow', 'was', 'miscast', 'series', 'huge', 'letdown', 'Lena', 'Headley', 'Cersei', 'Lannister', 'Headley', 'magnificent', 'looking', 'woman', 'Cersei', 'books', 'where', 'resemblance', 'ends', 'Were', 'Cersei', 'cruel', 'calculating', 'fiendishly', 'cunning', 'series', 'Headley', 'actually', 'strange', 'look', 'COMPASSION', 'things', 'eyes', 'most', 'time', 'where', 'Cersei', 'force', 'nature', 'books', 'screaming', 'cursing', 'contempt', 'wretched', 'brother', 'Tyrion', 'arduously', 'flirting', 'beloved', 'brother', 'Jaime', 'Headly', 'drooping', 'lilly', 'series', 'voice', 'barely', 'whisper', 'most', 'time', 'overwhelmed', 'scenes', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'even', 'Michele', 'Fairley', 'Catelyn', 'Stark', 'too', 'much', 'same', 'criticism', 'applies', 'Nikolaj', 'Coster-Waldau', 'role', 'Jaime', 'Lannister', 'Again', 'Nikolaj', 'part', 'Jaime', 'handsome', 'roguish', 'where', 'Jaime', 'dashing', 'daring', 'risk-seeking', 'warrior', 'books', 'Nikolaj', 'across', 'stuffy', 'academic', 'more', 'comfortable', 'poring', 'tomes', 'library', 'lonesome', 'rather', 'baring', 'steel', 'battlefield.I', 'would', 'recommnend', 'viewing', 'are', 'fan', 'books', 'result', 'tepid', 'performances', 'cast', 'members', 'dont', 'expect', 'many', 'repeat', 'viewings']",N/A

Game Of Thrones is quite simply, like The Sopranos, The Wire and so many other HBO shows, in another class altogether from what's on TV.HBO is tailor-made for folks like me who avoid TV and grab the pick of the litter when it comes out on dvd. Or in this case blu-ray, which is perfect for such a lush production as GOT. Everything here is top-notch, while focusing on character above all (though never sacrificing huge sets and epic landscapes). Martin's books do, and that's why this is such a fine choice for adaptation: drama and lots of it. There's plenty of slash and hack for action fans (and be warned, there's some very graphic stuff, but less sensational violence and more brutally real), yet the real focus is on relationships, and the fine acting makes it work.There's not a duff performance in the bunch, and some real winners, above all Dinklage and Gillen, who as in The Wire plays a morally-challenged political weasel to perfection. Dinklage has a small part, but works it to the hilt (as in the original Death At A Funeral, such a great film). There are myriad plot lines here, and the excellent casting makes it all work. Harrington and Bean are two other standouts.The pacing of this first season is truly impressive, as is the credit the viewer is given for having some brains. Many things are hinted at rather than spoonfed to us, and it involves us to a much greater and more satisfying extent. Plus, in a rare twist, the series is very true to the books, and some of it is even written by Martin. Respect for the author's vision! What a novel concept...Above all, I like that they didn't try to make Lord Of The Rings again (HB RR O)---this is fantasy but it's more concerned with people than mythical creatures, and that keeps it always compelling. If they keep this series at this level it will go down with The Sopranos and The Wire as one of the best tv series ever made.{Edit: 4/12/12. Well that won't be the case judging from the first few episodes of season two. Looks like killing off your best actor and character ain't a very good idea.

The show takes twists and turns that I cannot anticipate (having not read all the books yet) and keeps surprising me.  While not always pleasant, it keeps me riveted and wanting more each week, and now that season 3 is over, I really miss it, so I've started reading the books.  HBO has spared no expense with this show; the acting, writing, special effects, costumes, editing, sets - all of it - is top notch.What I enjoy most about the show is how no one person is all good or all bad (except, maybe Joffrey...).  I find myself rooting for a character who I previously disliked.  You grow to understand these characters and their journeys are fascinating.

1269951,A1XDN8H4MZK2TT,B002IFT1ZA,Lorenzo,"[15, 104]","I purchased the Game of Thrones First Season. This film is poorly written and directed. The characters are generally cold. The characters in the story need more development to make it interesting. I am guessing that it is a film which is supposed to be an epic similar to Lord of the Rings. The producers of this film spent more time on very graphic violence, many scenes of very vulgar sexual acts, and the entire movie represents a cynical way of looking at life. For the money spent making this movie, it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I imagine that the creators of the movie had no respect for their audience, assumed that they were stupid and need violence and sex to pay attention to the movie.I have seen movies with sex and violence in them before before, but this one is really overdone and it does not work to make the story connect.The first season ends, which I am assuming is a cliff-hanger.

HBO seems committed to following the books to the conclusion so long as it's economically viable (just renewed through season 3 which will cover 1/2 of book 3) meaning we could easily 10 years here (at a minimum 7 novels and some split to two seasons).::::Though I don't consider them spoilers, some plot set-up follows in the next paragraphs::::At first impression GOT, based very closely on George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series, is a story about the Stark family, lords of the North in the mythical land of Westeros. Lord Eddard Stark is called upon by his childhood friend, partner in rebellion and now King of the Seven Kingdoms, to take the position of Hand of the King and travel south to Kings Landing to basically rule the kingdom while Robert ""hunts, drinks and whores himself to an early grave. The family must divide up, the eldest son Robb, his mother and two youngest brothers remain in their home Winterfell, Ned and their two daughters (the eldest now betrothed to the crowned prince)travel to Kings Landing while Ned's Bastard son goes north to ""the wall"" (a 700 ft miles long wall of solid ice separating the ""wild"" north) to join the black guard.Very quickly all semblance of peace is gone. Stark learns that the old hand may have been murdered, the queen may have born her children out of incest and a move to grab the thrown may be in play. Meanwhile the last decedents of the over-thrown king are in the east, the vanquished prince has traded his sister as wife to a massive tribe of horse-lord barbarians in exchange for an army to march into Kings Landing to re-take the throne.A death late in the season sent some viewers crying fowl and running from the show, though, it's merely following the book and is the catalyst for the events of the next for novels.The show appears to have been shot digitally, not a bad thing, but blu-ray hounds will note the grainy look, but it saves a ton of money and the show cost over $50,000,000 for 10 episodes (season two is 15 - 25 million over that yet). The DTS-HD track is fine, though the nuance sounds you get in a theatrical film aren't there to begin with, nor are they required. The production values are excellent, no visual effect looks cheap, nor do you ever have to take the show with a grain of salt because it's not a theatrical film. The show is also relentless in gore, sex and explicit nudity as well as language, this is not for children or the easily offended.The acting is near flawless and the dialogue well written if not verbatim from the book. The one issue is the heightened age of everyone in the story. All the children are 2 - 3 years older than the book, the Starks should be at the most in mid to late thirties are pushing fifty. No idea why the did this, anymore than I understand casting a woman in her mid-twenties to play the 13 year old Dany (except they couldn't have a 13 year old with all the nudity and sex.) In the long-run though it will add up to continuity issues in a story where keeping track of when-what-happened is already hell. As the plot gets thicker and more complex in the next seasons the writers are going to have to alter history a bit to fit the age difference's in. But when Dany's older brother looks at the 24 year old woman and says ""you have a woman's body now"" it sounds really stupid because, yeah, she's had it for 10 years!The issue with the Blu-Ray is the menus. For some idiotic reason each disk has the same, exact menu options, even if the content of the link isn't available on that disk. So done watching EP2? Click EP3 and a message ""insert disk 2"" comes up. Same thing with extras.  And there's ""In Episode"" feature, an annoying drop down you have to keep clicking through rather than a ""pop-up"" feature that feeds you facts as you relax and enjoy.It's a great show, really alone in it's class and puts Spartacus to shame in a hundred different ways. Absolutely worth the Blu-Ray set and books. It's also noteworthy that there's such a depth to the story and mythology you can watch these over and over and keep coming away with new information you missed or didn't get before.",4,Show is better than the Blu-Ray,1335916800,"05 2, 2012",2012,4244,"[""'ll"", 'count', 'masses', 'come-late', 'readers', 'who', 'got', 'sucked', 'now', '5', 'novels', 'watching', 'show', 'HBO', 'committed', 'following', 'books', 'conclusion', 'so', 'long', 'economically', 'viable', 'just', 'renewed', 'season', '3', 'will', 'cover', '1/2', 'book', '3', 'meaning', 'could', 'easily', '10', 'years', 'here', 'minimum', '7', 'novels', 'split', 'two', 'seasons', ':Though', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'spoilers', 'plot', 'set-up', 'next', 'paragraphs', ':At', 'first', 'impression', 'GOT', 'based', 'very', 'closely', 'George', 'R.R', 'Martin', 'Song', 'Ice', 'Fire', 'series', 'story', 'Stark', 'family', 'lords', 'North', 'mythical', 'land', 'Westeros', 'Lord', 'Eddard', 'Stark', 'called', 'upon', 'childhood', 'friend', 'partner', 'rebellion', 'now', 'King', 'Seven', 'Kingdoms', 'take', 'position', 'Hand', 'King', 'travel', 'south', 'Kings', 'Landing', 'basically', 'rule', 'kingdom', 'Robert', 'hunts', 'drinks', 'early', 'grave', 'family', 'must', 'divide', 'up', 'eldest', 'son', 'Robb', 'mother', 'two', 'youngest', 'brothers', 'remain', 'home', 'Winterfell', 'Ned', 'two', 'daughters', 'eldest', 'now', 'betrothed', 'crowned', 'prince', 'travel', 'Kings', 'Landing', 'Ned', 'Bastard', 'son', 'north', 'wall', '700', 'ft', 'miles', 'long', 'wall', 'solid', 'ice', 'separating', 'wild', 'north', 'join', 'black', 'guard.Very', 'quickly', 'semblance', 'peace', 'gone', 'Stark', 'old', 'hand', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'murdered', 'queen', 'may', 'have', 'born', 'children', 'incest', 'move', 'grab', 'thrown', 'may', 'be', 'play', 'Meanwhile', 'last', 'decedents', 'over-thrown', 'king', 'are', 'east', 'vanquished', 'prince', 'traded', 'sister', 'wife', 'massive', 'tribe', 'horse-lord', 'barbarians', 'exchange', 'army', 'march', 'Kings', 'Landing', 're-take', 'throne.A', 'death', 'late', 'season', 'sent', 'viewers', 'crying', 'fowl', 'running', 'show', 'though', 'merely', 'following', 'book', 'catalyst', 'events', 'next', 'novels.The', 'show', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'digitally', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'blu-ray', 'hounds', 'will', 'note', 'grainy', 'look', 'ton', 'money', 'show', 'cost', '50,000,000', '10', 'episodes', 'season', 'two', '15', '25', 'million', 'yet', 'DTS-HD', 'track', 'fine', 'nuance', 'get', 'theatrical', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'begin', 'are', 'required', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'excellent', 'visual', 'effect', 'cheap', 'do', 'ever', 'have', 'take', 'show', 'grain', 'salt', 'not', 'theatrical', 'film', 'show', 'also', 'relentless', 'gore', 'sex', 'explicit', 'nudity', 'as', 'well', 'language', 'not', 'children', 'easily', 'offended.The', 'acting', 'flawless', 'dialogue', 'well', 'written', 'not', 'verbatim', 'book', 'one', 'issue', 'heightened', 'age', 'everyone', 'story', 'children', 'are', '2', '3', 'years', 'older', 'book', 'Starks', 'should', 'be', 'most', 'mid', 'late', 'thirties', 'are', 'pushing', 'fifty', 'idea', 'why', 'did', 'anymore', 'understand', 'casting', 'woman', 'mid-twenties', 'play', '13', 'year', 'old', 'Dany', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', '13', 'year', 'old', 'nudity', 'sex', 'long-run', 'will', 'add', 'up', 'continuity', 'issues', 'story', 'where', 'keeping', 'track', 'when-what-happened', 'already', 'hell', 'plot', 'thicker', 'more', 'complex', 'next', 'seasons', 'writers', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'alter', 'history', 'bit', 'fit', 'age', 'difference', 'when', 'Dany', 'older', 'brother', '24', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'have', 'woman', 'body', 'now', 'really', 'stupid', 'yeah', 'had', '10', 'years', 'issue', 'Blu-Ray', 'menus', 'idiotic', 'reason', 'disk', 'same', 'exact', 'menu', 'options', 'even', 'content', 'link', ""n't"", 'available', 'disk', 'So', 'done', 'watching', 'EP2', 'Click', 'EP3', 'message', 'insert', 'disk', '2', 'up', 'Same', 'thing', 'extras', 'Episode', 'feature', 'annoying', 'drop', 'have', 'keep', 'clicking', 'rather', 'pop-up', 'feature', 'facts', 'relax', 'enjoy.It', 'great', 'show', 'really', 'alone', 'class', 'Spartacus', 'shame', 'hundred', 'different', 'ways', 'Absolutely', 'Blu-Ray', 'set', 'books', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'such', 'depth', 'story', 'mythology', 'can', 'watch', 'keep', 'coming', 'away', 'new', 'information', 'missed', 'did', ""n't"", 'get']",N/A

1269988,AU2ZQYTLT611C,B002IFT1ZA,Menkaure,"[3, 3]","Just the fact that this product has been reviewed over 1300 times says quite a bit about Game of Thrones. There's very little that I can add to what has already been said---this is an excellent series considering that its a television adaption of George R.R. Martin's best-selling novels. In fact, I've never seen a television adaption that did more justice to its source material. The writers made a remarkable effort to stick as closely to the books as possible. There have been a number of criticisms from other reviewers, some of which seem fair and others which are way out in left field in my opinion. It is these I'm going to address in my review, and by doing so, offer a review of Game of Thrones itself.1) It's not like Lord of the Rings, and therefore is not true fantasy:My response: hogwash! LOTR was written 50 years ago and targeted to children and teens. LOTR was a great series, both in literature and film, but it is not the definition of fantasy. GOT is for adults, it's fresh, and it's author, GRR Martin, specifically took great pains to correct or address many of the faults found in traditional fantasy epics; that is, untarnished, invincible heroes who can do no wrong and never die. In GOT there are no angels or saints, and anybody can die at any time. This makes for great edge of your seat viewing.2) It's graphically violent.True! Both the books and the television series are extremely violent and gory. For me, this adds to the constant tension and sense of danger, and brings a real-world grit to the show often lacking in traditional fantasy. But for those who do not like a lot of blood and violence, this series is not for you.3) It's gratuitous and pornographic.Agreed. That's HBO for you. The books had their fair share of sex, but nothing like what's in the show. It doesn't bother me personally, but it also brings nothing to the story and seems to be there for no other reason than to titillate over-sexed heterosexual males. There is far more female nudity than male, in fact, almost comically there is an exposed breast in every third scene. Again, not a problem for me, but it adds nothing at all to the entertainment.4) It's soap-operatic. Again, true. It's the nature of epic television series in general, but this is a soap opera of huge proportions.5) It's boring.Huh? On what planet could GOT be boring??? It's chaulk full of violence and intrigue, with dashes of romance and revenge, mystery, horror, and magic. This is the definition of entertainment!6) It's cheap-looking.I'm on the fence about this criticism. For television, it's at the very top of production quality and attention to detail. For a feature-length film, no. But this is a television series, folks. We're never going to get movie-quality production in a television series---the budget and time constraints just won't allow it. It looks really good for what it is.7) It has a homosexual scene.Yes, unfortunately it only has one, and there's not much to see other than two young men nude from the waist up. They don't even kiss. If you can watch a series with over 500 heterosexual sex scenes, and find fault with one homosexual scene that doesn't even contain sex, then you need to move to another part of the world---say Uganda or Iran or somewhere else stuck in the dark ages.To sum up, GOT is a fantastic series, as good as television entertainment gets. However, if you demand unicorns and elves in your fantasy, turn squeemish at the sight of blood, and do not want to see gratuitous nudity every 3-10 minutes, than GOT is definitely not for you.",4,Review # 1310!,1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,3567,"['Just', 'fact', 'product', 'been', 'reviewed', '1300', 'times', 'quite', 'bit', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'very', 'little', 'can', 'add', 'what', 'already', 'been', 'said', '-this', 'excellent', 'series', 'considering', 'television', 'adaption', 'George', 'R.R', 'Martin', 'best-selling', 'novels', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'television', 'adaption', 'did', 'more', 'justice', 'source', 'material', 'writers', 'made', 'remarkable', 'effort', 'stick', 'closely', 'books', 'possible', 'have', 'been', 'number', 'criticisms', 'other', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'fair', 'others', 'are', 'way', 'left', 'field', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'going', 'address', 'review', 'doing', 'so', 'offer', 'review', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'itself.1', 'not', 'like', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'therefore', 'not', 'true', 'fantasy', 'response', 'hogwash', 'LOTR', 'was', 'written', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'targeted', 'children', 'teens', 'LOTR', 'was', 'great', 'series', 'literature', 'film', 'not', 'definition', 'fantasy', 'GOT', 'adults', 'fresh', 'author', 'GRR', 'Martin', 'specifically', 'took', 'great', 'pains', 'correct', 'address', 'many', 'faults', 'found', 'traditional', 'fantasy', 'epics', 'untarnished', 'invincible', 'heroes', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'never', 'die', 'GOT', 'are', 'angels', 'saints', 'anybody', 'can', 'die', 'time', 'great', 'edge', 'seat', 'viewing.2', 'graphically', 'violent.True', 'books', 'television', 'series', 'are', 'extremely', 'violent', 'gory', 'constant', 'tension', 'sense', 'danger', 'real-world', 'grit', 'show', 'often', 'lacking', 'traditional', 'fantasy', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'lot', 'blood', 'violence', 'series', 'not', 'you.3', 'gratuitous', 'pornographic.Agreed', 'HBO', 'books', 'had', 'fair', 'share', 'sex', 'nothing', 'what', 'show', ""n't"", 'bother', 'personally', 'also', 'nothing', 'story', 'be', 'there', 'other', 'reason', 'titillate', 'over-sexed', 'heterosexual', 'males', 'far', 'more', 'female', 'nudity', 'male', 'fact', 'almost', 'comically', 'exposed', 'breast', 'third', 'scene', 'Again', 'not', 'problem', 'nothing', 'entertainment.4', 'soap-operatic', 'Again', 'true', 'nature', 'epic', 'television', 'series', 'general', 'soap', 'opera', 'huge', 'proportions.5', 'boring.Huh', 'what', 'planet', 'could', 'GOT', 'be', 'boring', 'chaulk', 'full', 'violence', 'intrigue', 'dashes', 'romance', 'revenge', 'mystery', 'horror', 'magic', 'definition', 'entertainment', '6', 'cheap-looking.I', ""'m"", 'fence', 'criticism', 'television', 'very', 'top', 'production', 'quality', 'attention', 'detail', 'feature-length', 'film', 'television', 'series', 'folks', ""'re"", 'never', 'going', 'get', 'movie-quality', 'production', 'television', 'series', '-the', 'budget', 'time', 'constraints', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'really', 'good', 'what', 'homosexual', 'scene.Yes', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'one', 'not', 'much', 'see', 'other', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'nude', 'waist', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'kiss', 'can', 'watch', 'series', '500', 'heterosexual', 'sex', 'scenes', 'find', 'fault', 'one', 'homosexual', 'scene', ""n't"", 'even', 'contain', 'sex', 'then', 'need', 'move', 'part', 'world', '-say', 'Uganda', 'Iran', 'somewhere', 'else', 'stuck', 'dark', 'ages.To', 'sum', 'up', 'GOT', 'fantastic', 'series', 'as', 'good', 'television', 'entertainment', 'However', 'demand', 'unicorns', 'elves', 'fantasy', 'turn', 'squeemish', 'sight', 'blood', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', '3-10', 'minutes', 'GOT', 'definitely', 'not']",N/A

His beautiful Queen Cersie, and her family, the Lannister line:  her one brother is like the evil prince in Shrek 2 (Handsome, but shallow), her son with the king, Joffrey, as beautiful and blond and with some possible evil tendencies himself, the &#34;imp&#34; brother, played expertly by Peter Dinklage, who is very smart with words and seems to have a way of always getting himself out of his constant dilemmas.  As with royal bloodlines, there are some secrets going on behind the scenes, and some drama ensues during this visit between the two families, making the King side with either his wife and family, or his friend and their children.Meanwhile there are some other forces out there with a brother and sister, fair-skinned and blond, almost reminiscent of the Dark Crystal gelflings, elf-like, who are lords of dragons, or something, whose father lost the throne, and they are forced to align with some barbaric horse-worshipping clan for their army.  She must become one with her new family so she can win her kingdom  back.  And so the battle for the iron throne begins. . .",5,"Great fantasy / battle for the kingdom show.""When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die.

If you have not read the books, this set is for you as it has extras that explain all the lore, the different family houses, relationships and personal histories of people. This is a fantastic story for those unfamilar and are thinking of doing a blind buy. Think of this as a cross between the Tudors and lord of the rings. Like Lord of the rings, there is a fantasy element present but its more about the people and their vying  for control over the Realm or just trying to survive the tyrany and war between the lords. The Fantasy element is something that starts small and is very slowly building in the background. Its a merciless story where the just are not rewarded and tyrants are not stopped by the good guys. Its alot closer  to how things would really be in a world  that happened to have some fantasy creatures in it.

Nash ""teacher""","[4, 6]","This series is outstanding, the writing is impeccable.After watching the first episode of ""Game of Thrones"" about a year ago, I became completely enamored of the show. The rest of last summer was spent reading the series of fantasy books by George R.R. Martin.  He understands how to create a fantasy world based on fact.  The characters, cultures, and situations are infused by events, locations, and people who were often very real and made their mark felt by us today. Look up the Lancasters, Hadrian's wall, the War of the Roses, the Mongols, and the Colossus of Rhodes for a start!The right actors were found to play very complex characters.  You may find that you have favorites.  Don't get too attached to any of them, though!HBO has put the necessary money into bringing the books to life with top-notch production values.  Every episode is better than most movies released today. George R.R. Martin brought his vision to the right place. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss show tremendous respect for the books and even bring dialogue directly into the scripts.  The show is fast-paced, intelligent, and has made all the other TV shows that I used to like - boring.  My only request would be to tone down on the nude scenes that might interfere with character development!As for the controversy about George Bush's head on a pike next to the Starks - they are the side that represents family values!

After watching the first episode I was hooked and I decided to buy the first four novels together in paperback soon after (for less than $20!). I have been keeping pace with each episode and I'm surprised how much they have translated from book to screen. At the rate I'm going I'll be finished with the first book a couple of days after the final episode ends this Sunday (800 plus pages in a month is fast for me). Having seen the show first actually helped me visualize the book and the huge number of characters within it.The enormous cast is excellent in every role. I can't picture anyone other than Sean Bean as Ned Stark and Peter Dinklage steals every scene, much as his character does in the book, as Tyrion Lannister. The visuals are big budget movie calibur and the writing, thanks to the outstanding source material, is better than anything I've seen on TV or at the movies in a long time. The Lord of the Rings trilogy are really good fantasy movies of course, but the lack of eye rolling dialogue found in Game of Thrones really puts it a notch above. Plus you get the added gore and sex that just adds to the realism.HBO is back on the map with high quality shows like this and Boardwalk Empire. Here is to hoping the show last the 7 seasons (one for each book) it needs to tell the complete story.Edit 6/24/2011: I saw the finale and loved every minute.

1270011,AK1298ALMMYK0,B002IFT1ZA,Mushroom Samba~,"[3, 6]","What follows is a review of the Game of Thrones: Season One Blu ray set ... not a review of the show itself, of the series, of fantasy as a genre, or anything else.  This is a review to let you know what you're getting when you open the box and put the discs in your blu ray player.What you get:Game of Thrones comes packaged in an attractive fold-out cardboard case with a decorative slipcover.  The box art contains images of various characters in the series: a Stark, some Lannisters, a few Baratheons, and even a Snow just for good measure.  There are five discs in this set, each one emblazoned with the sigil of one of the powerful noble houses inhabiting the world of Westeros.  A handy insert is included, along with some advertisements for other GoT merchandise, providing a brief synopsis of each episode as well as its writing credits.  The insert also contains genealogies of the four main families featured in season one, as well as the members of their housholds, the royal court, and some allies.  Open up this insert, opposite all of the information previously listed, is a full map of Westeros.The Discs:The episodes are spread across all five discs which is convenient enough, but I would have preferred a separate ""bonus"" disc.  The special features are listed in the description, but the short version goes like this; there are commentaries on selected episodes and a handful of bonus features on each disc giving you information about houses, characters, history, locations, some making of featurettes and interviews etc.  It's all interesting stuff but nothing wildly unexpected.The interface itself on these discs isn't all that great, although it does look nice enough.  There is no scene selection menu which seems like a glaring omission, and the on-screen bonus features that play while you're watching an episode actually seem pretty distracting.  Sadly a lot of the ""bonus"" information is presented entirely as text, which is pretty crummy considering these are blu rays.  It would've been nice to see HBO shill out the extra cash to have a ""Maester"" conduct ""Lessons"" on the various houses, nations, and other powers at play in Westeros.  This feels like a missed opportunity, but I'm really picking nits.Load times ... oh man load times.  It takes two minutes to load the disc from selecting play on the blu ray player menu to the start of an actual episode.  This.  Is.  Bonkers.  I'm not sure what's at fault here, but I've tried this set on three different blu ray players (Sony BDP S380, Samsung BD-D6700, and an original Sony PS3 Fat/the one that's backwards compatible) and in each case the discs take about two minutes to load.  I've tried disabling BD live, but all that seems to do is make the loading icon (a moving image of a weirwood) disappear ... then again this loading icon only shows up occasionally anyway.  I've encountered reports on a few forums that in some cases people can't get their discs to load at all, fortunately I haven't had that problem and your individual mileage may very - but something is definitely up with these discs.Audio/Video quality:Visually I have no complaints with GoT.  It's honestly one of the most beautiful blu rays I've come across.  There are no artifacts of any sort visible, and black levels and fine detail are revelatory.  Textures pop with insane detail; the hair and pores on an actors face, embroidery on fabric and embossing on leather, wood grain ... it goes on and on.  There's not a single shot that isn't downright beautiful.  Even the darkest night scenes featuring the black brothers, which is essentially black on black, offer no crush or loss of fine detail ... as long as your display is up to the task.  This is one of the best releases on the blu ray format, truly perfect visual representation.As for the sound, uh it's good.  I guess.  I'm not an audiophile, and as such not nearly as concerned with audio fidelity as I am with the visual.  Despite that though the encode on these episodes seems nice enough.  A surround system gives a great sense of presence in all of the environments without ever getting too bass-y or blowing out the high end.  When the Hand has his first council in King's Landing there's a great sense of directionality to the conversation (voices reverberating from walls and columns).  It's one of those small details, but it really sells the experience.  All in all it's good.  And in case anyone is wondering if you're watching these episodes through headphones, a soundbar, or built-in speakers you're not missing out on anything ... I promise!Pros -Game of Thrones: Season One on blu ray is worth the price of admission purely for the quality of the visuals alone.  All of the other stuff is just gravy.  I haven't worked my way through all of the bonus features, but they seem entertaining/educational enough so far.Cons -The biggest one hands down is load time.  I've never come across discs that take two minutes to load up and sadly it's unlikely that anything is going to improve this built-in flaw.  Each blu ray player manufacturer will have to release a firmware update (for specific players in many cases) to address this issue which ... seems unlikely.  If you buy this set and can't stand the load times or can't get your discs to play at all - contact HBO.  Let them know that they're BD java programming sucks.The bonus features could be implemented a little better.  I would've like to have had commentaries on every episode, and I would have preferred a fixed commentator cast as opposed to an ever changing one.  Still what's there in the commentaries is entertaining enough, but the set feels kind of incomplete.  I don't like reading text on my television, not for any decent stretch of time.  HBO should really have taken it upon themselves to film something to show us this information, instead of copy-pasting faq-type material.  A disappointment.Give me scene search ... seriously this has been available on pretty much every title I've encountered since blu ray launched.  This omission is silly.The Verdict:Despite some serious flaws in execution - load times load times - Game of Thrones is a must buy.  If you've read the books, like fantasy or genre fiction, or whatever ... you have to buy this series.  If epic fantasy isn't your cup of tea, well - borrow these from a friend then.  You just might get hooked._________________________Edit:Special FeaturesWell it hasn't taken me long to flip flop on some of my feelings already.  In regard to the special features (histories and lore) I've warmed to the short snippets included in this release.  Selecting one of these special features will play an animated featurette, averaging 2-3 minutes, narrated by a relevant character; for example Viserys narrates the title ""Valyria & The Dragons"".  These are pretty cool after all, although longer entries and a ""play all"" feature would definitely be welcome.  I'm still not thrilled with the on-screen experience during playback of an episode, but I can see that it would definitely be useful for a lot of viewers.  So in that regard, it is a plus.",5,Perfect Presentation - Ample bonus features - Handsome Packaging,1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,7105,"['What', 'review', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'Season', 'One', 'Blu',

Martin's bestselling fantasy series ""A Song of Ice and Fire.""If you haven't read the novel series: don't.  The TV series is understandable without having read the original novels.  A little background information could be helpful for you.  In a fantasy world, about 16 years ago the Seven Kingdoms were ruled by Mad King Aerys of the Targaryen family.  The Baratheon and Stark families (with many allies) overthrew the Targaryens, killing most of them.  Two small children, Viserys and Daenerys (Dany for short) were smuggled out.  When the novel begins, Viserys dreams of returning to the throne, now held by Robert Baratheon.  Robert's second-hand man (the ""Hand"" of the King) has just died under mysterious circumstances.  Robert heads north to offer the job to Eddard (""Ned"") Stark, who rules the northern region of the Seven Kingdoms as a sort of governor.  Further north, the realm is bordered by a giant wall of ice.  Legend has it that monsters live north of the wall, but who believes in monsters?If you have read the series: I think the actors did a very good job in their portrayals.  The creative folks behind the series seem to have gotten the idea into their heads that ""there are no bad guys"" in the series.  This is not true, but it hasn't hurt the series yet (but Cersei is pushing it.)There's more sex and nudity than there was in the original first novel.  There's this really weird thing going on in this series that people are calling ""sexposition:"" either before, during, or after sex, some man is explaining to a woman (usually Rose, a prostitute, a character not in the novels who seems to have been invented for just this puropse) vital background data.  It's very difficult to pay attention to what the characters are saying while this is going on.  After the third or fourth time this happens, you're thinking to yourself  ""Uh-oh, they're about to have sex.  Let me bring out my notebook, this is bound to be on the final.""  There's this one scene in particular where Littlefinger commands two of his employees to play with each other, well, I had to play that scene about 6 or 7 times before I was able to concentrate on what Littlefinger was saying.Regarding the special features of the DVD set:  There's a fold-out map that contains family trees with pictures of the main characters on the reverse side.  If you're new to the series, I advise that you look only at this, and do not look at any of the special features on the discs before watching all 10 episodes, because some of these contain spoilers, particularly on disc 5.

The BluRays play fine on my Sony BD player (current firmware), with no artifacts or problems.I've been a fan of GRRM (the author of the series, a Song of Fire and Ice) long before the show, making me the ""skeptical audience"" for an on-screen translation, but his participation in making this series is evident in how closely the shows hew to the original storyline.  The few divergences stand out for their rarity.  It's also evident in how many episodes there are per book-- just enough to convey such a complex story, but far better than the usual condensed Hollywood versions of books.The shows are distinctly more sexy than the books, and a little less violent, but it feels balanced.  And who would object to a little sexiness (particularly if you don't object to the bloodshed!).The shows are also a little less gritty than the books.  People are mostly healthier, life appears less hardscrabble than the accurately pre-industrial depictions in the books.  For example, Tyrion is a reasonably attractive dwarf, rather than an ugly, misshapen dwarf as he is in the books.I won't rehash reviews of the episodes or story-lines, suffice it to say that the plot is complex, the cast large, the story enormous, very compelling, and occasionally shocking.

Buying these all together is far cheaper than buying them seperately. I have been reading them as the first season is being re-aired on Sunday nights on HBO 2 and it has made the veiwing oh so much better as I am keeping pace with each episode as the replay. It's not only the book come to life, but it is knowing what is going through the characters thoughts as the plot unfolds in the book and TV show simaltaniuosly (now I have the DVD set which I ordered from Amazon last week and it arrived the same day it came out in stores). This is the best book series I have ever read it has surpassed Frank Herberts DUNE series as my all time favorite series ever. You feel as though you become a part of the storey as you go along.  I also love the extras with Gearge R.R. Martin explaing everything in the show and books on the 5th Disk (It's nice to get inside the authors head and here his thoughts on why he did something or his ideas in general.  I highly recommend the Game Of Thrones: The Complete First Season on Blu-Ray and say YOU ABSOLUTLY HAVE TO GET THE BOOKS AND GET THE DVD'S!!!

1270070,AQV142R2H69QK,B002IFT1ZA,Red on Black,"[26, 37]","Having never read any of the ""Song of Ice and Fire"" series of fantasy epic books by George R . R. Martin's (with the fifth about to be released) has not proven a significant problem in following HBOs epic serialisation. Granted approaching the television series did require some care since the pre fanfare on Sky cast it as sort of ""Lord of the Rings Lite"" not least with the presence of Sean Bean. Happily this is not the case. For one ""Game of thrones"" is largely free of huge set piece battles, it also requires real patience since it is a series that slowly unfurls it glories through multiple plots and all kinds of political skullduggery. This is high fantasy for Machiavelli fans since ""Game of thrones"" has a ""Il Principe"" quality to it as rulers struggle to maintain or gain power through a mixture of the methodical exercise of brute force, deceit and downright treachery. Indeed some have suggested that it not so much Gandalf the Grey as James J. Gandolfini from the Sopranos.It is in addition it is beautifully filmed, has incredible sets and you almost shiver with the chill of Winterfell and the ancient Ice Wall. But at the heart of this series is tremendous characterization and intriguing plots which gradually weave together to great effect. And as with most HBO series this is a very liberal sprinkling of sex and violence, thus if you don't like this sort of thing please don't buy it.No review could do justice to all the characters so lets pick out a few. Bean is of course very solid as Ned Stark and so to is Michelle Fairley as his wife Catelyn. The emerging star of the Stark family however is the wonderful young actress Maisie Williams as their daughter Ayra who somehow dominates the screen everytime she comes on and grows in importance as the plot line evolves. Their primary enemies are the Lannisters who are a mixed bunch. For the life of me every time Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster Waldau) enters the series I can help but think of ""Lieutenant Templeton ""Face"" Peck"" (Dirk Benedict) from the A Team! That said this family contains the two real stars of the series the beautifully twisted and power hungry English actress Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister and the utterly sublime Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister who brings new meaning to the term ""poison dwarf"". Cersai is the archetypical power behind the throne, cruel and bent of gaining power. She is beautiful but twisted and not in the least anxious about incestuous relationships , murder and deceit if they will seal power. Baddies always have the best lines and a classic is her lecture to Starks daughter which is a lovely piece of sarcastic realpolitik. As she questions ""Do you have any notion what happens when a city is sacked, Sansa? No, you wouldn't, would you? All you know of life you learned from singers, and there is such a dearth of good sacking songs."" As for Dinklage his part of Tyrion the dwarf is an acting masterclass. He plays the part of this ""half man"" as a lecturous, whoring, rude, cunning and often hilarious character with such aplomb that he steals every scene and you feel almost guilty for liking him quite so much. His scenes at the prison at Eyrie or with the Mountain Clans of the Vale are some of the best as his survival instinct kicks in and he outmanoeuvres his capturers. Fantastic stuff and other honourable mentions should go Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo the powerful and violent horse lord and his surprisingly resilient wife Daenerys Targaryen played by the lovely Emilla Clarke.""Game of thrones"" is made up of a predominantly British and Irish cast who demonstrate that our two little islands have talent to spare. It is series which more than lives up to advanced billing and HBO will thankfully be filming a second outing shortly particularly as the ominous threat of ""winter coming"" and all sorts of viciousness from the other side of the Ice Wall looms large. All in all it's a great series and should secure a prime position on the shelf near the Wire, the West Wing, the Sopranos and your other big box sets.

I didn't see the 1st season when it was on HBO originally, but they started re-airing the 1st season in January  to get ready for the 2nd season. I almost pre-ordered the 1st season on Blu-Ray, but I decided to wait and watch it on HBO. Boy am I glad I did. Now I know a lot of people really like this HBO series. I got through the first 4 or 5 episodes of the 1st season; not loving it, but just watching because I enjoyed the book so much. Right off the bat didn't like how they depicted the whites in the opening scene. They are slow and sluggish in the book; strike 1. Several characters are presented well; Robb Stark, Jon Snow, Arya Stark, Littlefinger, to name just a few. But Tyrion Lannister is probably the most interesting characters in the books and Peter Dinklage does a good job, but he is too good looking and isn't shown enough. Sean Bean as Ned Stark is too brutish. It was really hard to get past Catelyn Stark looking like such an old hag; strike 2. The final straw was their depiction of Loras Tyrell and Renly Baratheon; couldn't believe it. Don't know where they came up with that. I asked a friend of mine who turned me on to the books; he hasn't seen the entire 1st season either. I explained how they depicted sir Loras and Renly and he never suspected how they portrayed them in the HBO series.

I expect the blu ray discs will be fine, but if they aren't, I will update this review.The first thing I noticed is that the casting was just about perfect.  The actors were all well chosen for their roles.  No Hollywood cuties here.  To their's and the directors' credit, there was no ""over-acting"".  Everyone stayed true to character.  Some characters gave you an instant impression of where they were on the spectrum of good and bad, while others had a bit more subtle...just as they were in the book.  The sets were superb as were the locations.  Each region had its own feel and nothing was laid on too heavily.  You got the feeling you were looking at a ""real"" place.To be fair, the series doesn't cover everything in the book.  If it did, it would have to have 50 episodes, rather than 10.  But it does keep the storyline intact and understandable.  Besides, we don't absolutely need to know all the things they wore and ate, or just how frequently they had sex.  Yes, there is sex in the series.  I didn't feel it was gratuitous.  some of it was absolutely necessary for the plot and the rest gave an insight into the mores and habits of the different peoples.  Were there differences between the book and series?  There were a few, but when they occurred, it was to make the series more understandable without some of the details contained in the book.There are two questions I'll try to address.  If you haven't read the book, will you enjoy the series? Yes, if you lake a well told story that is fantasy, but not the kinds that kids like.  Will you like the book if you see the series first?  Absolutely.  If you like stories where everyone lives happily ever after and the good guys always win, this isn't for you.

Giving those of us familiar with the books a brief refresher and those new to the series a sense of the geography, direction and distances.4.) a pulsating, musical score to start each episode that perfectly fits the heraldic spirit of this story.Conclusion:HBO has done a wonderful job making this first book (Game of Thrones), into a first rate TV series. 5 Stars.Ray Nicholson",5,A brilliant transition from book to TV series,1306108800,"05 23, 2011",2011,1170,"['need', 'rehash', 'plot', 'GRR', 'Martin', 'fabulous', 'A', 'Song', 'Ice', 'Fire', 'series', 'everyone', 'remotely', 'interested', 'extraordinary', 'piece', 'fantasy/adventure', 'familiar', 'medieval', 'story-line.Things', 'liked', 'HBO', 'series', '1', 'not', 'often', 'movie-series', 'out', 'be', 'perfect', 'visual', 'compliment', 'what', 'many', 'consider', 'be', 'gold', 'standard', 'epic', 'fantasy', 'writing', 'atmosphere', 'subtle', 'edginess', 'brutal', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'really', 'grasp', 'mood', 'essence', 'book.2', 'addition', 'presenting', 'riveting', 'tale', 'production', 'acting', 'books', 'characters', 'life', 'realistic', 'settings.3', 'computer', 'enhanced', 'animated', 'map', 'shown', 'short', 'cut', 'scene', 'start', 'episode', 'Giving', 'familiar', 'books', 'brief', 'refresher', 'new', 'series', 'sense', 'geography', 'direction', 'distances.4', 'pulsating', 'musical', 'score', 'start', 'episode', 'perfectly', 'heraldic', 'spirit', 'story.Conclusion', 'HBO', 'done', 'wonderful', 'job', 'making', 'first', 'book', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'first', 'rate', 'TV', 'series', '5', 'Stars.Ray', 'Nicholson']",N/A

Don't doubt it.  There are plenty of other rave reviews to convince you on here.The real reason for me to write this review is for the sake of those with a blu ray player that has trouble with the apparently overly complex menu system.  A lot of folks are having trouble even getting the discs to load, especially on the later discs.  It is not confined to any one brand machine, though some do better than others, and it seems inconsistent at that (you're not guaranteed to have trouble with these discs).It appears the workaround is to load up disc 1 and then choose the episode you want from there; it asks for the appropriate disc and you eject disc 1 and insert the one you really wanted to watch.  It's a bit of a pain, but it seems to work, and it beats the heck out of waiting on and on, staring at a black screen wondering if the disc you want will load up on the first, third, or fourth try or at all.  Actually takes far less time, even after waiting through the HBO ads I can't seem to skip at the start of disc 1.That stated, I still give this set a 5-star review, because even with this annoying flaw, it's still that good.  And beautiful on blu.  Do not hesitate to purchase this set--the extra features on the blu ray set are just as well done.  Rarely do the extras turn out to be so integral to an experience, and rarely do they meet, let alone exceed, your expectations.Can't say enough good things about this set; just use the menu from disc 1 to load all other episodes on the rest of the set, and you're all good.  (Actually, once you have a disc running, you can choose any other episode on that disc from that disc's menu without going back to disc 1; it's getting the darn things to load up initially that is the issue.)I hope this helps anyone who has been frustrated or was wary because of hearing the discs were buggy or something.",5,Use Disc 1 Menu to Select Episodes,1332028800,"03 18, 2012",2012,1990,"['series', 'phenomenal', 'true', 'book', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'Rivals', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'good', 'Do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'rave', 'reviews', 'convince', 'here.The', 'real', 'reason', 'write', 'review', 'sake', 'blu', 'ray', 'player', 'trouble', 'apparently', 'overly', 'complex', 'menu', 'system', 'lot', 'folks', 'are', 'having', 'trouble', 'even', 'getting', 'discs', 'load', 'especially', 'later', 'discs', 'not', 'confined', 'one', 'brand', 'machine', 'do', 'better', 'others', 'inconsistent', ""'re"", 'not', 'guaranteed', 'have', 'trouble', 'discs', '.It', 'workaround', 'load', 'up', 'disc', '1', 'then', 'choose', 'episode', 'want', 'there', 'appropriate', 'disc', 'eject', 'disc', '1', 'insert', 'one', 'really', 'wanted', 'watch', 'bit', 'pain', 'work', 'heck', 'waiting', 'staring', 'black', 'screen', 'wondering', 'disc', 'want', 'will', 'load', 'up', 'first', 'third', 'fourth', 'try', 'Actually', 'far', 'less', 'time', 'even', 'waiting', 'HBO', 'ads', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'skip', 'start', 'disc', '1.That', 'stated', 'still', 'give', 'set', '5-star', 'review', 'even', 'annoying', 'flaw', 'still', 'good', 'beautiful', 'blu', 'Do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'purchase', 'set', 'extra', 'features', 'blu', 'ray', 'set', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'Rarely', 'do', 'extras', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'so', 'integral', 'experience', 'rarely', 'do', 'meet', 'let', 'alone', 'exceed', 'expectations.Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'set', 'just', 'menu', '1', 'load', 'other', 'episodes', 'rest', 'set', ""'re"", 'good', 'Actually', 'once', 'have', 'disc', 'running', 'can', 'choose', 'other', 'episode', 'disc', 'disc', 'menu', 'going', 'back', 'disc', '1', 'getting', 'darn', 'things', 'load', 'up', 'initially', 'issue', 'hope', 'anyone', 'who', 'been', 'frustrated', 'was', 'wary', 'hearing', 'discs', 'were', 'buggy', 'something']",N/A

The exiled daughter of the mad king is gathering an army of barbarians while cradling three dragon eggs, ready to take back the kingdom. And a family is broken up by the actions of a drunken king and an evil knight called the Kingslayer.I can't summarise the whole series here, it's too complex and why would I want to ruin it for someone coming to it new? I did read the books years ago though. 2000 I read ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Clash of Kings"" and utterly loved the story. I can say that a lot of what I saw in these 10 episodes had a lot of what went on in ""Game of Thrones"" and several casting choices were perfection itself. I'm thinking particularly of the Lannisters who all look exactly as I imagined, especially the best character in the entire series Tyrion - Peter Dinklage deserves an Emmy for his work here.I didn't think of Sean Bean as the likely star of the show or of the best person to play Ned Stark but he does well here. Nor did I think all of the cast would speak with haughty English accents or variants of the Yorkshire brogue, but it's better than having them speaking with American accents.To those who haven't read the books and are coming to this cold - it is a bit slow. It wasn't until the later episodes that I really felt the series took off. This is mostly because of the death of an important character which changes the situations for everyone involved and the story really starts to come together. It's with the conflicts of the various characters, Daenerys plotting her return, the Starks and the Lannisters gearing up for a fight, and the supernatural menace to the North, that the books really took off and where this series ends, so a viewer could be forgiven for thinking not enough happens. I think Season 2 will be outstanding as the action will be unrelenting and a host of fascinating situations reveal themselves. Season 1 felt like the setup where you meet the characters, understand the world, and then got a taste of what was coming.Not that it wasn't done well. Every episode features beautiful scenery, costumes, and sets. ""The Eyrie"" was particularly breathtaking, especially with the cell Tyrion is imprisoned in. All of the actors do a fine job and the writing was very loyal to the books. I think a lot of the magic and a lot of the fighting present in the later books will make this series even more popular but meanwhile this series did a fine job of prepping the audience for what this story is all about - good vs evil on an epic scale.It's absolutely fantastic to see fine literature translating into fine television. I cannot wait for Season 2 to explode when ""Game of Thrones"" returns next spring. Definitely a must watch for fans of great television.",5,Fantastic fantasy,1311984000,"07 30, 2011",2011,2858,"['kingdom', 'Robert', 'Baratheon', 'peril', 'Whitewalkers', 'North', 'Wall', 'are', 'massing', 'much', 'oblivion', 'everybody', 'South', 'exiled', 'daughter', 'mad', 'king', 'gathering', 'army', 'barbarians', 'cradling', 'three', 'dragon', 'eggs', 'ready', 'take', 'back', 'kingdom', 'family', 'broken', 'up', 'actions', 'drunken', 'king', 'evil', 'knight', 'called', 'Kingslayer.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'summarise', 'whole', 'series', 'here', 'too', 'complex', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'ruin', 'someone', 'coming', 'new', 'did', 'read', 'books', 'years', 'ago', '2000', 'read', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'Clash', 'Kings', 'utterly', 'loved', 'story', 'can', 'say', 'lot', 'what', 'saw', '10', 'episodes', 'had', 'lot', 'what', 'went', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'several', 'casting', 'choices', 'were', 'perfection', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'particularly', 'Lannisters', 'who', 'look', 'exactly', 'imagined', 'especially', 'best', 'character', 'entire', 'series', 'Tyrion', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'Emmy', 'work', 'here.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'likely', 'star', 'show', 'best', 'person', 'play', 'Ned', 'Stark', 'well', 'here', 'did', 'think', 'cast', 'would', 'speak', 'haughty', 'English', 'accents', 'variants', 'Yorkshire', 'brogue', 'better', 'having', 'speaking', 'American', 'accents.To', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'are', 'coming', 'cold', 'bit', 'slow', 'was', ""n't"", 'later', 'episodes', 'really', 'felt', 'series', 'took', 'off', 'mostly', 'death', 'important', 'character', 'situations', 'everyone', 'involved', 'story', 'really', 'come', 'together', 'conflicts', 'various', 'characters', 'Daenerys', 'plotting', 'return', 'Starks', 'Lannisters', 'gearing', 'up', 'fight', 'supernatural', 'menace', 'North', 'books', 'really', 'took', 'off', 'where', 'series', 'viewer', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'thinking', 'not', 'enough', 'think', 'Season', '2', 'will', 'be', 'outstanding', 'action', 'will', 'be', 'unrelenting', 'host', 'fascinating', 'situations', 'reveal', 'Season', '1', 'felt', 'setup', 'where', 'meet', 'characters', 'understand', 'world', 'then', 'got', 'taste', 'what', 'was', 'coming.Not', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'well', 'episode', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'sets', 'Eyrie', 'was', 'particularly', 'breathtaking', 'especially', 'cell', 'Tyrion', 'imprisoned', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'writing', 'was', 'very', 'loyal', 'books', 'think', 'lot', 'magic', 'lot', 'fighting', 'present', 'later', 'books', 'will', 'make', 'series', 'even', 'more', 'popular', 'meanwhile', 'series', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'prepping', 'audience', 'what', 'story', 'good', 'vs', 'evil', 'epic', 'scale.It', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'see', 'fine', 'literature', 'translating', 'fine', 'television', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'Season', '2', 'explode', 'when', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'returns', 'spring', 'Definitely', 'must', 'watch', 'fans', 'great', 'television']",N/A

1270117,AIBRTGBN07D6A,B002IFT1ZA,Scott,"[10, 15]","I have been a fan of George R.R. Martin for several years now, and I think it would be accurate to label me a Martin ""Fan Boy.""  I have readA Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Onefour times, been active on message boards, followed his blog for years and practically pulled my hair out in frustration at reading countless posts about the New York Jets andWild Cards Iwhile waiting anxiously forA Dance with Dragons: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Fiveto finally be released. At the news that HBO had picked up the rights to Thrones to adapt to a series, I couldn't have been more excited.  A 13 episode series, from a company like HBO, was fantastic news.  While you might presume that authors like Martin would love fans like me, we are a double edged (Dothrakian) sword.  Although we will eagerly consume everything Martin's world creates, that adoration also comes with an overwhelming amount of scrutiny, which authors and production companies can almost find it impossible to live up to (e.g, Tom Bombadil and the Scouring of the Shire fromLord of the Rings, The: The Fellowship of the Ring - Extended Edition). I followed the development of this series with other fans from the initial announcement until the final trailer.  Even though I saw those same type of demands and expectations from fans, I can say that HBO produced not only the closest adaptation of a book I have seen, but even managed to surpass Martin's original story in some aspects.Told over the course of ten one-hour episodes, HBO's Game of Thrones might seem at first glance to simply be a high fantasy adventure story, but it can more aptly be described as a political drama.  Taking place in an alternate medieval world, the series focuses more on the characters and their interactions with each other than on the adventure aspect.  Character development, and Martin's refusal to write a conventional story, ensure that the viewer is always kept on the edge of their seat. I remember finishing one of the first chapters of the book and sitting up in my bed in shock, thinking about what had just happened and trying to figure out how Martin could have done that.  I have no doubt that viewers of the first episode will feel the same way.  The acting, especially performances by Sean Bean (as Ned Stark) and Peter Dinklage (as Tyrion Lannister) is superb.  Production value on the show is nothing less than amazing and it looks more like a feature film than a cable series (especially the opening sequence).If I had to name any criticisms of the show, all I could say is that some of the acting, particularly Emilia Clarke (Daenerys) and Michelle Fairley (Catelyn Stark), was a little stiff.  I know Martin includes a lot of sex in his books, but it seemed like some of the scenes were designed a little more toward shock value.  Tyrion was not nearly ugly enough  (if at all).  I know that sounds like a nitpick, but I think it's important to his character to mirror the misshapen appearance in the books, to draw more attention to his wits.  And lastly, it can be very difficult for a new viewer to keep track of all the characters and families without a cheat sheet. Even after reading all of the books I still had to look some people up.The first season of Game of Thrones is amazing writing combined with above-average acting and amazing production design and direction. Not only is it everything fans could hope for in a series, but it helps to bring Martin's work to a new audience, who might be turned off at the idea of reading a long and complicated fantasy series. Producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have done an excellent job of faithfully transitioning Martin's work to the small screen while keeping fans happy and introducing millions of new fans to the Seven Kingdoms.",5,"With their adaptation of 'Game of Thrones,' HBO deserves to sit atop the iron throne",1325635200,"01 4, 2012",2012,3774,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'George', 'R.R', 'Martin', 'several', 'years', 'now', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'accurate', 'label', 'Martin', 'Fan', 'Boy', 'have', 'readA', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'Song', 'Ice', 'Fire', 'Book', 'Onefour', 'times', 'been', 'active', 'message', 'boards', 'followed', 'blog', 'years', 'practically', 'pulled', 'hair', 'out', 'frustration', 'reading', 'countless', 'posts', 'New', 'York', 'Jets', 'andWild', 'Cards', 'Iwhile', 'waiting', 'anxiously', 'forA', 'Dance', 'Dragons', 'Song', 'Ice', 'Fire', 'Book', 'Fiveto', 'finally', 'be', 'released', 'news', 'HBO', 'had', 'picked', 'up', 'rights', 'Thrones', 'adapt', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'excited', '13', 'episode', 'series', 'company', 'HBO', 'was', 'fantastic', 'news', 'might', 'presume', 'authors', 'Martin', 'would', 'love', 'fans', 'are', 'double', 'edged', 'Dothrakian', 'sword', 'will', 'eagerly', 'consume', 'everything', 'Martin', 'world', 'adoration', 'also', 'overwhelming', 'amount', 'scrutiny', 'authors', 'production', 'companies', 'can', 'almost', 'find', 'impossible', 'live', 'up', 'e.g', 'Tom', 'Bombadil', 'Scouring', 'Shire', 'fromLord', 'Rings', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'followed', 'development', 'series', 'other', 'fans', 'initial', 'announcement', 'final', 'trailer', 'Even', 'saw', 'same', 'type', 'demands', 'expectations', 'fans', 'can', 'say', 'HBO', 'produced', 'not', 'only', 'closest', 'adaptation', 'book', 'have', 'seen', 'even', 'managed', 'surpass', 'Martin', 'original', 'story', 'aspects.Told', 'course', 'ten', 'one-hour', 'episodes', 'HBO', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'might', 'seem', 'first', 'glance', 'simply', 'be', 'high', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'story', 'can', 'more', 'aptly', 'be', 'described', 'political', 'drama', 'Taking', 'place', 'alternate', 'medieval', 'world', 'series', 'more', 'characters', 'interactions', 'other', 'adventure', 'aspect', 'Character', 'development', 'Martin', 'refusal', 'write', 'conventional', 'story', 'ensure', 'viewer', 'always', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'remember', 'finishing', 'one', 'first', 'chapters', 'book', 'sitting', 'up', 'bed', 'shock', 'thinking', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'happened', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'Martin', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'have', 'doubt', 'viewers', 'first', 'episode', 'will', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'acting', 'especially', 'performances', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Ned', 'Stark', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'Tyrion', 'Lannister', 'superb', 'Production', 'value', 'show', 'nothing', 'less', 'amazing', 'more', 'feature', 'film', 'cable', 'series', 'especially', 'opening', 'sequence', '.If', 'had', 'name', 'criticisms', 'show', 'could', 'say', 'acting', 'particularly', 'Emilia', 'Clarke', 'Daenerys', 'Michelle', 'Fairley', 'Catelyn', 'Stark', 'was', 'little', 'stiff', 'know', 'Martin', 'lot', 'sex', 'books', 'seemed', 'scenes', 'were', 'designed', 'little', 'more', 'shock', 'value', 'Tyrion', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'ugly', 'enough', 'know', 'nitpick', 'think', 'important', 'character', 'mirror', 'misshapen', 'appearance', 'books', 'draw', 'more', 'attention', 'wits', 'lastly', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'new', 'viewer', 'keep', 'track', 'characters', 'families', 'cheat', 'sheet', 'Even', 'reading', 'books', 'still', 'had', 'look', 'people', 'up.The', 'first', 'season', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'amazing', 'writing', 'combined', 'above-average', 'acting', 'amazing', 'production', 'design', 'direction', 'Not', 'only', 'everything', 'fans', 'could', 'hope', 'series', 'bring', 'Martin', 'work', 'new', 'audience', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'idea', 'reading', 'long', 'complicated', 'fantasy', 'series', 'Producers', 'David', 'Benioff', 'D.B', 'Weiss', 'have', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'faithfully', 'transitioning', 'Martin', 'work', 'small', 'screen', 'keeping', 'fans', 'happy', 'introducing', 'millions', 'new', 'fans', 'Seven', 'Kingdoms']",N/A

(Season 3 ended before I started season 1)I even gave up after 1 episode because the pilot episode had too much rape and child killing in it for my usual liking. (I tend to enjoy as little of those things as is humanly possible...call me old fashioned)But then everyone, and I mean EVERYONE started talking about the dang show telling me how I HAD to give it another try because I was judging the first episode too harshly.So I did. I gave it another try. I restarted with the pilot and still didn't like it. But I was fair and promised the 900 people who demanded I watch it to give it a 5 episode run before quitting. By the end of episode 2 I was hooked. I haven't been able to stop. I've been binge watching it for a week now trying to get through it so I can listen to what everyone around me is saying about it.

It's a show that features more bloodshed every hour than you could see in an all day film festival of Braveheart, Rambo, and Dead Alive. That's okay, but a little off color language is totally beyond your standards? Seriously?To the people who say the show is too violent...What, exactly, were you expecting in the show about a medieval war with dragons? Fluffy rainbows and unicorns?To the people who say the show is sexist and demeaning to women...You might now have noticed this blatantly obvious theme, but all the sexist characters are the bad guys. ALL OF THEM. All of the good guys are respective towards the women in the show. That seems like a condemnation of sexism to me, but what do I know...I won't even mention how many women in this show are strong in both character and morals. That Lady Stark being a bad ass to protect her family or Kahleesi fighting off death and destruction at every turn to keep her people safe really shows how weak women are, right?To the people who say the show is too misogynistic....Really? Misogyny in medieval times? How dare the writers depict such lies....To the people who say this show is badly acted and poorly filmed...I didn't know blind people watched much television.

Game of Thrones looked like your typical Medieval times storyline full of knights in shining armor, sword fights, debauchery and that kind of stuff. I was disinterested...until a few days before the premier I happened to catch a making-of Game of Thrones production. So I set my DVR.Game of Thrones is right up my alley. Indeed it has the sword fights and debauchery that I mentioned a second ago, but I was under the impression that this was to be a depiction of some real world that existed a long long time ago. No...not at all the case. In the opening moments of the show we are introduced to a place that clearly has some ""Otherly"" world creatures in it. So after a little checking I see that the story is based on the fantasy book series by George R. R. Martin called A Song of Ice and Fire.

1270136,A1DSES64WY3DGM,B002IFT1ZA,SnowDog3000,"[11, 20]","At least non-relevant to those who have read the novels.  The basic problem is that the novels were so incredibly detailed, that making a TV series out of them doesn't add anything to the story.  In fact, when they make changes in the story or characters, it takes away from the story.  Now, for those who have not read the books, it is probably a good watch, although some mis-perceptions of events may occur compared to the reality.What may have made more sense, and maybe 20 years down the road, the series will be re-made again, would be to either completely stick to the books (they do say that the future of TV and movies made using books as sources will be to stick as close to the source material as possible), or perhaps they should have down a few movies, or the best idea - to set some movies or a series set entirely dealing with the events at and beyond the Wall.  After all, this is where the most interesting cinematography occurs anyhow.While there have been some changes in characters, for the most part the actors are well-acted and  interesting, in particular (don`t mind my spelling): Eddard, Jon Snow (looks like Deidrich Bader), The Old Bear Mormont, King Baratheon, Ser Jorah, Arya, Sansa, Jamie, The Hound, Shagga.  Of course the key to good directing is to choose actors who fit the roles, not to change the roles to fit the actors.Khal Drogo is unfortunately a complete non-character as portrayed.  Theon will probably turn out well with his actor.That being said, they did make some changes from the books that were really not necessary (and therefore kinda of makes you wonder why they made them), for instance:- Catylyn Stark (and her sister Lysa Aryn) are way, way too old.- Cersei is supposed to be a great beauty, but they choose a very plain actress to play her.- the Dothraki are supposed to be Mongols.- Robert never baited the Lannisters (not counting Cersei).- Ser Loras was supposed to be someone that folks looked up to, instead they've turned him into a prancing fool- Robert never intended to join the joust, it was the melee.- for important reasons, they needed to make it very clear that Jamie was a great swordsman, but it is rarely shown or referenced- the Others would never cut off someone's head or dis-assemble them, cos' then they wouldn't come back very well as wights.- the books never specifically portrayed Ser Loras and Renly as homosexuals.  That is to say, they may have been and they may have not been, but there was no evidence either way.  Certainly, there were some insults thrown around from others characters, but then again accusing your enemies of homosexuality has been the insult of choice since the first battles at the dawn of time all the way up to the present war against Iraq.- Jamie would never stab someone in the eye, Jamie was the best swordsman in the land and certainly doesn't need tricks to beat some hack household guard..- Littlefinger was never a hands-on brothel manager, it was just a file in his business portfolio.- Catylyn's ""investigation"" of Bran's accident was a bit ridiculous.- the sky cells should be far narrower, there is supposed to be a constant fear of falling out when sleeping (not rolling 20 ft to get to the edge).- the Lannisters are supposed to have blond hair, not dirty brown.- Joffrey & Gendry should have long hair (and actually Joffrey is supposed to have long, curly hair), although long curly hair would have been difficult to pull off on TV to be honest.- Winterfell seems way too big and built up.- Robert and Gendry should have jet black hair (a key plot point).- Gendry seems too old.-  Lysa is supposed to be fat.-  Sam Tarly is not fat enough.- the king should be a lot taller (after all he was supposed to be one of the strongest warriors in the land), ever hear of `lifts`, boots, trick photography?, sheesh.- Cersei's emotion about a black-haired baby didn't to seem to make any sense considering the circumstances (I really think that would confuse viewers).-  too much of a difference in height / age between Arya and Sansa.-  Arya would never have made that bow shot.- Jon should be at the king's feast.Renly is supposed to be very charismatic and can gather many to his banners, yet the character on the tv series has no charisma at all- the older Night's Watch man was the one who survived, not the younger one.- i could be wrong, but i seem to recall that Lord Walder could not walk.- Rickon is too old.- and obviously the Moon Door is not in the floor, it is on a wall standing vertical (and face it, do you really think anyone is stupid to build an entire stone throne room over an empty space?)- I have also just heard that Season Two starts with a horrific event that did not happen in the books.None of these issue are major issues by themselves, but a lot of mistakes tend to add up, especially since they could have been corrected.And of course, as with most HBO shows, there is a certain amount of low-level prostitution (ie: a lot of the actresses will paid to take their clothes off and appear in sexual scenes).  There are additionally regular characters that are actually playing prostitutes or courtesans as well.  Hey, I am definitely not complaining about nudity, although HBO does come off as exploitative sometimes.The best part I think in the first season was the Wall, a very interesting placeThe overall impression that I received, was that I've already read the books, watching the 1st season really didn't add to the Games of Thrones experience, so I don't feel any particular desire to watch the second season.  That being said, for folks who haven't read the books, go for the 2nd season, I'm sure it's a lot better than Xena the Warrior princess (although one of those does show up later for that matter in the series).",3,"Decently made, but at the same time completely non-relevant",1333584000,"04 5, 2012",2012,5771,"['least', 'non-relevant', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'novels', 'basic', 'problem', 'novels',

It helps to have read the book, but the series stands on it's own for the most part, so it's recommended whether or not you've read the novel.I figured I'd watch the series on my 720P plasma in the family room (no surround sound), so I ordered the DVD version and not the Blu-Ray.  Since the wife didn't care for it, I ended up watching most of it in the basement in my somewhat small home theater room.I have a good surround sound setup that cost close to $3K (not bragging, a lot of real HT enthusiasts think this is entry level), a Panasonic Blu-Ray player and a 56 inch 1080P Samsung DLP TV, one of the later models that I set up according to guidelines of one of the top video gurus.  The DLP TV is pretty tough on regular DVDs with average transfers, there's often a grainy quality visible that goes beyond film grain.  I can say that Game of Thrones is probably the best DVD I've viewed on the TV.  The picture is very smooth and sharp (many DVDs have either one or the other), colors look realistic, and blacks are really black. The audio is great also, speech is clear, and when things bang and crash, you really hear it.  So, if you don't have the latest and greatest 1080P or Blu-Ray setup and are thinking of getting the DVD version, don't worry, you're still getting a top notch product.I can't think of much more to say.

Subtle.In Espenson's TV script: Viserys is led to believe that Khal Drogo will *never* give him his army, so he has little to lose in a desperate gambit.  Blunt.I seldom notice who wrote a TV show unless it's very good or very bad, but Espenson's work has jumped out at me.

If HBO cancels it right now, I won't be upset. If it runs for another 5 seasons, I'll watch. After struggling with these blu ray discs over the weekend, at this point I'm just in it for the LULZ. You have to laugh at the menu design, otherwise you'll throw the box set against the wall and cry.Short Version:There was a flock of dragons, and a very badly designed blu ray menu. That's about it. If you'd like the details, read on.The Blu Ray Discs:I don't know what the DVDs are like, but the blu rays make me mad as a hatter. I have seen complaints from many people who can't get them to load at all. I'm using a Sony BDP-S350 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player that I bought in 2009, and updated my firmware before I even bothered to insert a disc. They do take a very long time to load, but once they were loaded I didn't have problems beyond the confusing menus. Still, be prepared for potential problems.Frustration comes in with menus and having to constantly switch discs for bonus content. Whoever designed the menus, content and storage on these things should be trapped on a desert island with Joffrey Baratheon with no sunscreen. If you're in it just for the show, you should be fine. If you want to watch the extras, just know in advance that you are going to be as confused and frustrated as you are with the Cast of Thousands. Add to that about two dozen copyright notices that appear randomly in different languages after certain featurettes, and you may want to give the discs the same fate as Ned Stark.Some of the extras are on the discs where they say they are, and some of them are not. Let's say you want to watch episode one with commentary. It's on disc one with episode one. Same with episode two. Go to episode three, and it tells you to switch discs to watch episode three commentary. It does this throughout the set, sometimes sending you to the next disc, and sometimes sending you to the previous disc. After a certain point, you've forgotten where you were and you have to stop and figure out what episode you were on, and you wonder whether it's worth getting up 8 times just to get the extras.I was hoping the commentary would give me some more insight into what was going on in the show, but this sadly didn't pan out. The first episode with David Benioff and Dan Weiss does exactly what I wanted. There's another one with one of the directors giving good information, but the rest of the commentary really didn't contribute much. Or maybe I was just too frustrated with the menu to care at that point. Lena Heady pointed out something about Cersei's relationship with Sansa Stark that had not occurred to me, but that's the only useful thing I got out of it.A lot of the featurettes have been available on You Tube on HBO's own channel since the beginning of the series. Still, there are ones I have never seen and found quite interesting, like the making of the opening of the show, so you may find some great content here--if you can find the right disc. So the extra features are quite the mixed bag.Season One:This is a pretty good series, but it's got problems. It's supposed to be high fantasy, but it comes across as more alternate history. I think the rule for fantasy writers these days is to use as little magic as possible, but this series has been stripped of too much. The only hint of magic or otherworldliness comes at the end of the series with the appearance of the dragons. To make up for the lack of magic, they throw in a bunch of ""gritty"" stuff to make it more ""real,"" and I do mean they throw in everything--rape, incest, prostitution, graphic violence, and a potpourri of other disturbing images and events.Game of Thrones has way too much expository dialogue. It gets bogged down with characters talking about stuff that happened off screen years ago. Most of the time this is done to establish character, even though we already know what the character is like. We may even already know the story and it ends up being a repeat. They just keep talking and talking and will not shut up. Just when you think something is going to happen, someone launches into a long speech about some past traumatic event. Even Tyrion does this, and it's agonizingly long.They even do this during the quintessential HBO sex scenes, which themselves get way out of hand. I know this is HBO, and it's going to be graphic, but there's a point where it turns into bad soft porn and contributes absolutely nothing to story, character or anything else. I know this is why some people tune in, I know some of it is expected, I'm not a prude... it's just that the show takes it beyond the usual levels of absurdity.Then, there are loads and loads of characters--mostly because they keep getting killed off. This is one of those shows where anyone can die. What makes it irritating is that this often comes shortly after we've been told the character's life history and we actually start to care. A lot of times the information turns out to be unimportant, and you wish they had spent the time showing something else... anything else.You literally need to take notes to keep up with what's going on with so many plots and points of view. It's hard to remember all the names and relations. For example, The Lord Commander of the Night's Watch is father to Jorah Mormont. Jorah is the Wikipedia of Westeros who runs around with the Targaryen/Dothraki bunch in the Free Cities, doing a LOT of exposition along the way.Jorah was the one sending information about the Targaryens to the king, which is why he got a royal pardon for selling slaves. He is the one who disgraced the commander, and that's why the commander gave his heirloom sword to Jon Snow. It's hard to follow that in the series because there is so much other stuff going on. You have to watch it 2 or 3 times to get everything out of it. I had to go looking around fan web sites to figure out what was happening sometimes. The show is full of situations like this.In turn, the series progresses very slowly until Ned Stark's pivotal execution scene. The plot moves at the speed of smell until that point, then suddenly you've got battles, kings, hostages and negotiations all over the place. It's just as confusing at the faster pace, if not more so.Ultimately, the characters are the reason I stuck with the series. Peter Dinklage as the dwarf Tyrion Lannister is priceless as the highly intelligent snark knight. He's the only comedy relief in an otherwise exceptionally miserable world. At times I am just waiting for Tyrion to appear on screen and the other stuff is just time filler.Harry Lloyd as Viserys Targaryen was gone too soon, but what a spectacular exit! Fortunately Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon has stepped in as an entertaining character everyone can love to hate. Neither seems to have any redeeming qualities. I prefer my villains to have some bit of grey or good part to them, and I wish they would show more of Joffrey's human side.Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark is also one of my favorites, but most fans tend to not like her. I think it comes from Sansa's genre blindness and naivety. This changes, and I think it is interesting to see how someone who thinks the world works like fairy tales adjusts to a world as grim as this.I'm rating this series and blu ray set as four stars because I think most people will enjoy the main content. I'm not a huge fan, but I think almost everyone else would do well to give it a try. With so many characters and plots, most people are bound to find some part of the series they will want to follow. You're just going to have a difficult time of it if you want to enjoy the extra features.",4,"Decent show, VERY bad blu rays",1337558400,"05 21, 2012",2012,7721,"['Spoilers', 'follow.I', 'do',

It looked interesting enough and the fact that Sean Bean was in it made this a must buy for me.  So I purchased the first season and popped dvd one into my blu-ray player.  I was totally unprepared for and blown away by what this show had to offer.  This show is definitely not like most of the traditional medieval style fantasy movies/television shows out there.  This show bravely takes a convincing and unflinching look at the characters and their interactions together.  This means that most issues/elements that get dumbed down/sanitized in a lot of fantasy movies/television program is left intact in the this show from the fascinating characters both good and bad, their realistic motivations for doing the things that they are doing even if you don't agree with their methods, clever villains rather than the usual dimwitted ones, and good guys who don't always win regardless of how perilous the situation they find themselves in which to me is a welcome change.  This show also has lots of twists, plenty of political intrigue, superb action, and features some of the best production values I've ever see on a television program.

1270193,A2GOKFQGLRBXUB,B002IFT1ZA,TruAim,"[2, 2]","I don't have HBO so for the past few years I had not seen this show despite having heard A LOT about it.  I finally broke down and bought the first 2 seasons on DVD, and all I can say is WOW, it sucked me in from the very first episode and would not let me go until I'd finished Season 2!  And then I immediately had to start watching it all over again for a second time!  This show has to be the most epic show ever produced for television.For those unfamiliar with Game of Thrones (GOT), it's a cable TV show based on an as-yet-unfinished fantasy book series by author George R.R. Martin.  It's set in a fantasy world similar in many ways to our own world during ancient Medieval Times in England and Europe.  The notable exception being that dragons, zombies, shapeshifters, witches, warlocks and black magic exist in the fictional GOT world, though MUCH more sparingly than one might assume.  Dragons, zombies and magic seem to be rare and ancient things, almost lost and forgotten in the GOT world.  And their use in the story is handled very craftily and deftly, creating a rare mystique and uniqueness to these often overused fantasy elements.The content is very adult.  Like most dramatic cable TV series being made these days, it is a VERY adult show, with full-frontal nudity and graphic sex and violence.  So not really the kind of show you can enjoy with the family necessarily.  I have no idea why HBO doesn't put out an adult version and a family-safe version.  Seems with some editing and creative camera work, they could easily do both versions.  But for whatever reason they don't.  Nowadays, cable TV is a lot more ""adult"" than theater movies are.  Oddly, the adult content paradigm has completely switched around--the ""bad stuff"" now being more on TV than in the movies.  But honestly, the adult content in this show is a relatively small aspect of the show.  Concerning, yes, for families and possible underaged viewers, but it shouldn't dissuade the average adult viewer from seeing this truly remarkable show.The story in GOT is both simple AND exceptionally intricate--opposing comments, I know.  But that's how well this show-based-on-the-books is written.  The writing is spectacular.  At its core, a simple act in the first episode (a boy seeing something he shouldn't) leads to the unraveling of a tenuous peace between three ruling families on an island continent.  Mysteries, deceit and treachery are slowly spun and uncoiled, hidden truths are revealed, and soon the entire continent is building towards a war over a multitude of reasons.  That is a very simple assessment of a VERY complex and extremely engaging story.  But trust me, how it all unfolds is VERY entertaining and fun.  And the story doesn't pander to the audience at all.  In numerous cases I expected the story to go one way and it went the completely opposite way.  So the show challenges the viewer on many levels and is never afraid to pull the rug out from under our feet or add even MORE ongoing characters and storylines to its vast tapestry of epic storytelling.  Again, it all adds to the delicious fun of watching this hugely elaborate story unfold.The cast is enormous and the acting across the board is brilliant at all levels.  And Peter Dinklage in particular is phenomenal.  He stands out even among a cast of spectacular actors.The sets and wardrobe are jaw-dropping.  I've never seen sets or costumes as great as these on any TV show ever.  I don't follow the Emmys, so I don't know if this show has won any yet, but buckloads of Emmys should be rained down on the folks behind these sets and costumes.  We viewers greatly appreciate your hard work and your genius!The editing and camerawork are seamless, beautiful, perfect.  Same with the VFX.

There are not enough words to describe it. This is such a lush, vivid, dramatic piece of work, with no expense spared. From the writing, to the acting, to the glorious set pieces, costumes and locations, Game of Thrones is one of the best series in years. And being an HBO picture, you know the quality is there already. This is a fantasy series without it ever feeling out of place or too fantastical. The tone is just right.I don't wish to spoil anything regarding this series, but there are HUGE surprises, even from the very first episode. Most of the actors are new-comers, but do such a fantastic job and fit so well with the setting that their inexperience never shows. Sean Bean, the always mysteriously dashing, brooding actor is the main star of this first series. Again, not wanting to spoil anything, I'm just going to say that he will surprise you. Also a refreshing surprise came from the actor Peter Dinklage who plays the dwarf brother and son to a rich, spoiled family, and I would have to say he was my favorite part of the whole series. His quips are spot on and and each scene with him is even better than the last.Basically, if you love drama, intrigue, mystery, suspense, costumes, and great writing; you will love this show. Throw in some incest, sex, deception, murder and outrage and you have a whole new level of magnificence. The synopsis you can read right on the amazon dvd page so there's no point in repeating it, the less you know about it, the better it really is.I started actually reading the first book after the first season ended, and I must say; the writers and directors did a superb job with keeping up with the material. It is not an easy book to adapt. There are tons of different characters, locations and plot twists and even though I saw the show before reading the book, I had no trouble following along, and was quite impressed with how much was actually kept for the show.Easily a five star rated mini-series.

R. Martin's popular fantasy series of novels. Lord Stark (Sean Bean) finds himself pulled unwillingly into the court intrigue of King Robert (Mark Addy)who Stark helped put into power after the Mad King Targaryen executed Stark's grandfather along with thousands of innocent women and children. The King insists that Stark take on the role of Hand of the King to administer and protect the Seven Kingdoms from, among other things, the heir apparent to the throne Viserys Targaryen (Harry Lloyd)who pimps out his own sister (Emilia Clarke)for troops from Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa star of the forthcoming ""Conan The Barbarian""). Stark finds himself at odds with the Queen's (Lena Headey)wealthy family including her brutal brother Jaime Lannister(Nikolaj Coster-Waldau who, interestingly enough, appeared in the film ""Night Watch"")cunning Tyrion (Peter Dinklage)who must survive by his wits because he is a dwarf in a world of warriors.The Blu-ray transfer looks marvelous with a detailed, sharp transfer. The depth to the images are remarkable. The colors range from cold to sunny and warm depending on which of the main characters and lands the sequence is set in.The special features are quite good--we get seven commentary tracks (there are ten episodes of the show)and, unlike a lot of commentary tracks, there's plenty of good information both on the shooting of the episode, how the episode fits into the season and the development of characters, etc.We also get ""Episode Guides""--they provide a bit of trivia. ""The Complete Guide to Westeros"" gives us detailed information on the various families, maps, etc featured in the series. It's a nice interactive feature.The ""Character Profiles"" features the actors playing the roles discussing their characters.""Anatomy of An Episode"" gives us considerable insight from the beginning until the conclusion of production on the episode ""A Golden Crown"" one of the pivotal shows from the ten episode first season.""Making 'Game of Thrones'"" clocks in at around 30 minutes and is a good ""behind-the-scenes"" glimpse into the production of the series. As I recall much of this is repurposed from material available from the promo pieces and stuff at the website.""The Night's Watch"" gives us background on these characters and their mission to protect the realm that is drawn from the novels.""Creating The Title Sequence""  and ""Creating The Dothaki Language"" are interesting featurettes on the creation of the wonderful evocative opening sequence of the show as well as the langauge for the fierce Dothaki that will, later, be so important to the series.We also get quite a few Easter Eggs included as part of this set.Series developers David Benioff (novelist and screenwriter of ""The Kite Runner"" and ""Wolverine"")and D.B. Weiss manage to stay true to what made Martin's marvelously detailed novels so popular with readers while making the show visually appealing to viewers. The series does have a convoluted plot so if you miss an episode it's wise to try and catch up by actually watching what you've missed.I'm hoping that the show continues to develop in popularity so it doesn't face the same fate of ""Rome"", ""Carnivale"" and ""Deadwood"" all three shows that were rich in character development, plot and visually stunning shows that HBO cancelled without allowing them to fully develop. The ten episodes of the first season are filled with enough twists and turns for a 24 episode normal TV show.The strong performances from Bean, Dinklage, Headey and others in the case make their characters rich, appealing, appalling and sympathetic at turns. The stylish direction and visually rich production design only add to the appeal of the series which has just begun to develop more of the fantasy elements towards the end of the first season.I can recommend ""Game of Thrones"" based on viewing the HBO series and although I have no idea what special features HBO has for the Blu-ray or DVD set yet, even without those extras, this show is essential viewing.",5,A glimpse into the fantasy world of the Seven Kingdoms and those willing to do anything to take/keep power,1309651200,"07 3, 2011",2011,4232,"['Set', 'imaginary', 'Seven', 'Kingdoms', 'protected', 'eight', 'hundred', 'foot', 'wall', 'where', 'Night', 'Watch', 'wild', 'north', 'ancient', 'deadly', 'called', 'White', 'Walkers', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'nicely', 'feel', 'George', 'R.', 'R.', 'Martin', 'popular', 'fantasy', 'series', 'novels', 'Lord', 'Stark', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'pulled', 'unwillingly', 'court', 'intrigue', 'King', 'Robert', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'who', 'Stark', 'helped', 'put', 'power', 'Mad', 'King', 'Targaryen', 'executed', 'Stark', 'grandfather', 'thousands', 'innocent', 'women', 'children', 'King', 'Stark', 'take', 'role', 'Hand', 'King', 'administer', 'protect', 'Seven', 'Kingdoms', 'other', 'things', 'heir', 'apparent', 'throne', 'Viserys', 'Targaryen', 'Harry', 'Lloyd', 'who', 'out', 'own', 'sister', 'Emilia', 'Clarke', 'troops', 'Khal', 'Drogo', 'Jason', 'Momoa', 'star', 'forthcoming', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'Stark', 'odds', 'Queen', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'wealthy', 'family', 'including', 'brutal', 'brother', 'Jaime', 'Lannister', 'Nikolaj', 'Coster-Waldau', 'who', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'appeared', 'film', 'Night', 'Watch', 'cunning', 'Tyrion', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'who', 'must', 'survive', 'wits', 'dwarf', 'world', 'warriors.The', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', 'marvelous', 'detailed', 'sharp', 'transfer', 'depth', 'images', 'are', 'remarkable', 'colors', 'range', 'cold', 'sunny', 'warm', 'depending', 'main', 'characters', 'sequence', 'set', 'in.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'get', 'seven', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'are', 'ten', 'episodes', 'show', 'lot', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'plenty', 'good', 'information', 'shooting', 'episode', 'how', 'episode', 'season', 'development', 'characters', 'etc.We', 'also', 'get', 'Episode', 'Guides', 'provide', 'bit', 'trivia', 'Complete', 'Guide', 'Westeros', 'detailed', 'information', 'various', 'families', 'maps', 'etc', 'featured', 'series', 'nice', 'interactive', 'feature.The', 'Character', 'Profiles', 'actors', 'playing', 'roles', 'discussing', 'characters', 'Anatomy', 'Episode', 'considerable', 'insight', 'beginning', 'conclusion', 'production', 'episode', 'Golden', 'Crown', 'one', 'pivotal', 'ten', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'Making', ""'Game"", 'Thrones', 'clocks', '30', 'minutes', 'good', 'behind-the-scenes', 'glimpse', 'production', 'series', 'recall', 'much', 'repurposed', 'material', 'available', 'promo', 'pieces', 'stuff', 'website', 'Night', 'Watch', 'background', 'characters', 'mission', 'protect', 'realm', 'drawn', 'novels', 'Creating', 'Title', 'Sequence', 'Creating', 'Dothaki', 'Language', 'are', 'interesting', 'featurettes', 'creation', 'wonderful', 'evocative', 'opening', 'sequence', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'langauge', 'fierce', 'Dothaki', 'will', 'later', 'be', 'so', 'important', 'series.We', 'also', 'get', 'quite', 'few', 'Easter', 'Eggs', 'included', 'part', 'David', 'Benioff', 'novelist', 'screenwriter', 'Kite', 'Runner', 'Wolverine', 'D.B', 'Weiss', 'manage', 'stay', 'true', 'what', 'made', 'Martin', 'marvelously', 'detailed', 'novels', 'popular', 'readers', 'making', 'show', 'visually', 'appealing', 'viewers', 'series', 'have', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'so', 'miss', 'episode', 'wise', 'try', 'catch', 'up', 'actually', 'watching', 'what', ""'ve"", 'missed.I', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'show', 'develop', 'popularity', ""n't"", 'face', 'same', 'fate', 'Rome', 'Carnivale', 'Deadwood', 'three', 'shows', 'were', 'rich', 'character', 'development', 'plot', 'visually', 'stunning', 'shows', 'HBO', 'cancelled', 'allowing', 'fully', 'develop', 'ten', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'filled', 'enough', 'twists', 'turns', '24', 'episode', 'normal', 'TV', 'show.The', 'strong', 'performances', 'Bean', 'Dinklage', 'Headey', 'others', 'case', 'make', 'characters', 'rich', 'appealing', 'appalling', 'sympathetic', 'turns', 'stylish', 'direction', 'visually', 'rich', 'production', 'design', 'only', 'appeal', 'series', 'just', 'begun', 'develop', 'more', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'end', 'first', 'season.I', 'can', 'recommend', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'based', 'viewing', 'HBO', 'series', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'special', 'features', 'HBO', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'set', 'yet', 'even', 'extras', 'show', 'essential', 'viewing']",N/A
1270210,A2XOS0D485JSMM,B002IFT1ZA,webhawk50,"[0, 0]","Well, unfortunately, once started I couldn't quit watching The Game of Thrones.  I just finished watching Season Two and am looking forward to being able to purchase Season Three in February, 2014.  The HBO special was so good, I also decided to purchase the Kindle version of the books.  So far, the Kindle version parallels the series quite accurately, further demonstrating how faithful to the books the HBO series is.  Of course, there are some relatively minor changes as would be expected, but so far nothing that dramatic. I'm not normally very much into this kind of fantasy stuff in the first place, but the acting and writing (in both the books and the series) is so outstanding that I haven't been able to simply walk away and forget it.  The only problem I have is that all my favorite characters keep getting killed off and I find myself badly wanting Joffrey's head on a platter along with his creepy evil queen mother.  That means that they are doing a great job of acting.The actual content of the DVD gets a 5 star rating, but I have knocked off a star because of the convoluted menu system used on the DVD.  It is designed so that you can't easily select a given chapter.  That is completely unacceptable in this day and age when a simple chapter selection menu is the norm.  Other than that, the quality of the Blu-Ray DVD is excellent.  There are also several other features of this set, such as a complete guide to Westeros, an anatomy of episode six (""A Golden Crown""), a 'making of' feature and so forth.Despite the crummy menu system, I would still recommend this set.  Game of Thrones is, in my opinion, one of the best adult Television series ever devised.  However, if you are offended by nudity and/or violence, avoid this series.  This is strictly mature adult material and should be treated as such.

Sadly at the time I had to travel overseas before I could finish the first season.  So I cheated and actually got all the ebooks and read them while I was gone working for a few months.  I actually have read all of them up to the last that George Martin finished which is A Dance With Dragons I believe.  It's been a while.Anyway if you are a fan of mid evil style action and the usual HBO high drama then this is a show for you.  I have yet to meet anyone that has not liked it.
