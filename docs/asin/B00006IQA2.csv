I have to say it was a lot more challenging than I expected, but I totally agree with the other people who said it was difficult to follow.  For an intro to bellydance, they focus a lot on her face, not on her whole body; there were times I could not figure out what I was suppose to do (were my knees bent?  Was I stepping forward? How was I suppose to step forward?  What was she doing with her arms?)  A different camera angle is all I need to completely love it, though.  I think they are tremendous fun!Edit:  I purchased Veena and Neena's ""Discover Bellydance"" set and found that it really helped with the basics of understanding what I was supposed to be doing.  For more advanced moves, the ""Warrior Goddess"" and ""Finger Cymbals"" definitely cover areas that other instructional tapes don't.  If you're advanced, you probably won't have any trouble with the beginning DVDs, and enjoy the whole set.  If you're a bellydance beginner, I'd recommend purchasing ""Discover Bellydance"" to start and  Dolphina's ""Warrior Goddess"" and ""Finger Cymbals"" separately.",3,Good but hard to follow,1050537600,"04 17, 2003",2003,1110,"['Wow', 'did', 'get', 'great', 'workout', 'video', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'challenging', 'expected', 'totally', 'agree', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'said', 'was', 'difficult', 'follow', 'intro', 'bellydance', 'focus', 'lot', 'face', 'not', 'whole', 'body', 'were', 'times', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'suppose', 'do', 'were', 'knees', 'bent', 'Was', 'stepping', 'forward', 'How', 'was', 'suppose', 'step', 'forward', 'What', 'was', 'doing', 'arms', 'different', 'camera', 'angle', 'need', 'completely', 'love', 'think', 'are', 'tremendous', 'fun', 'Edit', 'purchased', 'Veena', 'Neena', 'Discover', 'Bellydance', 'set', 'found', 'really', 'helped', 'basics', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'more', 'advanced', 'moves', 'Warrior', 'Goddess', 'Finger', 'Cymbals', 'definitely', 'cover', 'areas', 'other', 'instructional', 'tapes', 'do', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'advanced', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'trouble', 'beginning', 'DVDs', 'enjoy', 'whole', 'set', ""'re"", 'bellydance', 'beginner', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'Discover', 'Bellydance', 'start', 'Dolphina', 'Warrior', 'Goddess', 'Finger', 'Cymbals', 'separately']",N/A

I do like the dvds though, and they are taped in beautiful locations.

Dolphina's instructions are good but she tends to rush from move to move, not giving you much time to comprehend and absorb the dance step. In addition, the camera direction is extremely distracting. For example, the camera tends to focus on Dolphina's face, when it should be focused on her body movements that pertain to learning the step. Also, the camera shot is pulled back much too wide in some scenes to include the beautiful backdrop, instead of a tighter shot on Dolphina's full body, so it's easier to see and follow her instruction.On a postive note, the warm-up sessions are well done. Dolphina takes time to really get you into the mood to dance, both body and mind. I wish I could give this a better rating, becuase I do feel that Dolphina is a good instructor, but regrettably for anyone, much less a beginner, the poor camera-work interfers and overshadows the viewer's ability to understand and learn the steps easily.",1,Not Recommending This Instructional Bellydance Video,1121990400,"07 22, 2005",2005,1111,"['Dolphina', 'persona', 'fabulous', 'sets', 'are', 'beautiful', 'outfits', 'are', 'great', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'viewer', 'clear', 'understanding', 'how', 'do', 'steps', 'being', 'taught', 'Dolphina', 'instructions', 'are', 'good', 'rush', 'move', 'move', 'not', 'giving', 'much', 'time', 'comprehend', 'absorb', 'dance', 'step', 'addition', 'camera', 'direction', 'extremely', 'distracting', 'example', 'camera', 'focus', 'Dolphina', 'face', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'focused', 'body', 'movements', 'pertain', 'learning', 'step', 'Also', 'camera', 'shot', 'pulled', 'back', 'much', 'too', 'wide', 'scenes', 'include', 'beautiful', 'backdrop', 'instead', 'tighter', 'shot', 'Dolphina', 'full', 'body', 'easier', 'see', 'follow', 'instruction.On', 'postive', 'note', 'warm-up', 'sessions', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'Dolphina', 'time', 'really', 'get', 'mood', 'dance', 'body', 'mind', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'better', 'rating', 'becuase', 'do', 'feel', 'Dolphina', 'good', 'instructor', 'regrettably', 'anyone', 'much', 'less', 'beginner', 'poor', 'camera-work', 'interfers', 'viewer', 'ability', 'understand', 'learn', 'steps', 'easily']",N/A

We love the costumes!Warrior Goddess:Much better camera work and a great ab workout.  We love the fact that she messes up at times and has the grace to keep going.  It really gives us some hope!Veils:Wonderful arm workout and she breaks down the moves to make them very easy to understand.Zils:I like that she sets the beats to phrases so that they are easy to remember.

716800,AMTV3L9A3WPSG,B00006IQA2,"E. L. White ""member of the 3AM Zill Brigade""","[10, 13]","Learning how to dance from Dolphina is a challenge. First, she demonstrates moves improperly by not isolating them, which is the entire point of bellydance: isolation. It's not a bicycle hip if you use your whole body to do it. Sometimes she shows one move and then teaches another. For example, she shows what looks like a backwards hip figure 8, then teaches an upwards hip figure 8. Not only that, she teaches the move wrong so that it is harder to do! On one of her veil moves she teaches you to twist to look behind you and dip one arm down with the other up, and alternate. Then she shows the move and both arms are supposed to be at the same level throughout the move, not one down and one up. So again, she taught it wrong and the viewer has to figure it out on his/her own. While demonstrating moves, she tries to throw in other movements as well, such as wrist circles. Instead of looking graceful, she wriggles like a warm on a hook. Her arm movements themselves are stiff and awkward. If you don't know what a move is supposed to look like, she wont help.In the finger cymbals video, she doesn't teach proper zil technique. Instead, she gives the viewer cheats by teaching them phrases to zil to. This isn't a problem if you want to flail around the house and make noise while chanting silly phrases to yourself. But if you really want to learn, this will make you worse off then when you started. You will not know how to play along to music, recognize middle eastern rhythms, or improvise your own rhythms to accentuate your dancing.Dolphina's voice really bugs me. She sounds like she has no brains. She tries to impress the viewer by word dropping, talking about opening chakras and such.Some reviewers say ""it's just for fun! Don't take it so seriously"". It's *supposed* to be an instructional video, not a silly fun-time learn nothing video. Instead it ends up being the later of the two. So, if you don't really care about learning to dance properly, and you would like a video that's silly and full of Hollywood flare, maybe this is for you. Or, if you thought (think?) bellydance is just for turning on men instead of a difficult and complex art form, I'm sure you will find this video fits your quick-fix needs. (PLEASE do not advertise this as real bellydance, because it makes us real dancers look bad) However, if you REALLY want to learn bellydance, this is NOT for you. Why learn bellydance from someone who can hardy do it? Find a teacher if you can. If not, Veena and Neena are better. You might also try Atea for basic moves, or Mesmera for finger cymbals.

I have been dancing for 5 years and may be biased, but I found her movements to be stiff, jerky, with little isolation between her lower and upper body (during the hips segment her head bounces has her hips move). While the choreographies at the end of the videos in theory have some decent combinations, Dolphina executes them poorly.Overall there are some good ideas of moves from the videos, and I will mopst likely continue to use them to help me guide my own practices, but I do not recommend the Goddessworkout tapes.

716805,A2E4NL8OMP33E5,B00006IQA2,"Stephanie Goodell ""starwildflowr""","[2, 3]","These are great for a beginning dancer with proper expectations.  She breaks down the movements and each dvd ends by teaching a complete routine that can then be practiced without the dvd (cuz the songs are easy to find, each dvd has an accompying cd with really nice world music- subtle enough for background dinner music... and when the routine song comes along at the end of your meal, you can jump up and dance for your guests).  I strongly recommend getting the cds also because after a couple weeks you will have the routine memerized and might want to just pop in the cd and practice in front of a mirror instead of your tv, so you can perfect your form.Dolphina has been accused of being an airhead but I found her to be sweet and encouraging.  She is just trying to make it fun. If you are a beginner, you will find these challenging but will probably be able to get the hang of it in a week or so.  The drawback to the routines is that she just goes through it- no breakdowns or warning- she tells you what she is doing as she does it but it is very fast. But the routines aren't hard once you have tried them a few times.I do not like her finger cymbal dvd as much as the one by Caroleena Nerrichio (sp?).  Dolphina's is harder than it needs to be.  She jumps into it too quickly.  Caroleena gets you comfortable with your zills, helps you listen for rhythems and THEN combines them with movement.  After I did dolphina's, I felt like zills were really hard... but when I did it with Caroleena's I felt like ""zills are totally easy, what did I think they were so hard for?"" and teaching style had ALOT to do with that.But bottom line- if you are in it for the workout: you will define your obliques beautifully.  I got Dolphina's dvds after I had my third baby and in one month I had a gorgeous defined belly that looked better than it it did when I was eighteen.Her aim is to sculpt, more so than teach you to dance.
