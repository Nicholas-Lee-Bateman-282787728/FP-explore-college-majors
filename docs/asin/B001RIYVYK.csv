I'm willing to bet that the MTM show will be given a high-quality set worthy of the show itself.For those of you interested in buying this or any other show on disc, you may wish to make it a basic gound rule to always wait for the box of the complete series to be made available first before you seriously consider buying it. It may take a few years but, trust me, if the show is popular (especially if it was made more recently) it will eventually be made available in its entirety in a single, comprehensive package. This is standard practice.Of course, for those of you who do not want to wait for the single big box, it's fine for you to prefer to buy the seasons individually as they arrive. But always keep in mind that the complete series package will likely make its way to fans at some point, usually within a year after the final season of a show is released on disc. This is why, currently, I still don't have any discs at all in my collection of shows I love, like Heroes, Bewitched, 24, The Bob Newhart Show, True Blood, Hill Street Blues, The Tudors and, yes, The Mary Tyler Moore Show. They each have single-season packages available but no box of the full series yet (and some of them won't for years). Aside from being comprehensive and, in my mind, easier to organize and find specific episodes, the big boxes also tend to be somewhat less expensive on an episode-by-episode basis, and even on a seasonal basis.In the age of Blu-ray, I also strongly prefer, and even require, certain TV series (mainly those originally broadcast in high-definition) to be available on high-definition Blu-ray discs. This on top of the requirement that they be in a single package that contains the complete series. If you're concerned about hi-def, you should make sure the show is on Blu-ray. (This doesn't apply to the MTM show because it was never in high-def.)Finally, I expect all the episodes to be edited and presented the exact way they were originally broadcast, with all the scenes, music, diaglogue, etc., intact. This also means that if an episode was originally made in black & white, it must be in black & white on the disc, not colorized. If this is important to you, you should check the critical and customer reviews here and elsewhere on the web to make sure that's the case before you buy any TV series.You should also read reviews to see if there are any defects discovered in the set (poor packaging that falls apart; discs that freeze or skip in playback; discs that are routinely scratched, etc.) Some persistent issues may be a dealbreaker for you.To me, it's a pleasant surprise that the full series is finally being made available in one box, even though the single-season volumes haven't all been realized yet. For those who had been purchasing those single-season volumes, you shouldn't despair, as I'm sure the remaining seasons will become available in the same format you bought the earlier seasons in, probably soon after the full-series box comes out. In fact, I imagine that, due to the existence of the full-series box, the remaining single-season volumes will be published much faster than the ones prior.In short, this should really be good news for everyone so, unless there are actual problems with the full-series box set, after it's made available to the public, or your comments concern the content of that box or the series itself, please stop underrating this item and box sets similar to it.",5,Looking forward to the The Mary Tyler Moore Show big box set.,1241308800,"05 3, 2009",2009,4204,"['five-star', 'rating', 'solely', 'first-rate', 'content', 'quality', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'rate', 'actual', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'made', 'available.To', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'frustration', 'coming', 'box', 'set', 'full', 'series', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'very', 'welcome', 'news', 'indeed', 'only', 'way', 'would', 'buy', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'purchasing', 'big', 'single', 'box', 'complete', 'show', 'most', 'basic', 'complete', 'series', 'box', 'set', 'should', 'contain', 'episodes', 'number', 'discs', 'organized', 'identified', 'season', 'series', 'guide', 'episode', 'season', 'name/number', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'episode', 'bonus', 'features', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'selected', 'episodes', 'more', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', 'MTM', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'given', 'high-quality', 'set', 'worthy', 'show', 'itself.For', 'interested', 'buying', 'other', 'show', 'disc', 'may', 'wish', 'make', 'basic', 'gound', 'rule', 'always', 'wait', 'box', 'complete', 'series', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'first', 'seriously', 'consider', 'buying', 'may', 'take', 'few', 'years', 'trust', 'show', 'popular', 'especially', 'was', 'made', 'more', 'recently', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'entirety', 'single', 'comprehensive', 'package', 'standard', 'practice.Of', 'course', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'wait', 'single', 'big', 'box', 'fine', 'prefer', 'buy', 'seasons', 'individually', 'arrive', 'always', 'keep', 'mind', 'complete', 'series', 'package', 'will', 'likely', 'make', 'way', 'fans', 'point', 'usually', 'year', 'final', 'season', 'show', 'released', 'disc', 'why', 'currently', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'discs', 'collection', 'shows', 'love', 'Heroes', 'Bewitched', '24', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'True', 'Blood', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'Tudors', 'yes', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'have', 'single-season', 'packages', 'available', 'box', 'full', 'series', 'yet', 'wo', ""n't"", 'years', 'Aside', 'being', 'comprehensive', 'mind', 'easier', 'organize', 'find', 'specific', 'episodes', 'big', 'boxes', 'also', 'tend', 'be', 'somewhat', 'less', 'expensive', 'episode-by-episode', 'basis', 'even', 'seasonal', 'basis.In', 'age', 'Blu-ray', 'also', 'strongly', 'prefer', 'even', 'require', 'certain', 'TV', 'series', 'mainly', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'high-definition', 'be', 'available', 'high-definition', 'Blu-ray', 'discs', 'top', 'requirement', 'be', 'single', 'package', 'complete', 'series', ""'re"", 'concerned', 'hi-def', 'should', 'make', 'sure', 'show', 'Blu-ray', ""n't"", 'apply', 'MTM', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'high-def', 'Finally', 'expect', 'episodes', 'be', 'edited', 'presented', 'exact', 'way', 'were', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'scenes', 'music', 'diaglogue', 'etc.', 'intact', 'also', 'episode', 'was', 'originally', 'made', 'black', 'white', 'must', 'be', 'black', 'white', 'disc', 'not', 'colorized', 'important', 'should', 'check', 'critical', 'customer', 'reviews', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'web', 'make', 'sure', 'case', 'buy', 'TV', 'series.You', 'should', 'also', 'read', 'reviews', 'see', 'are', 'defects', 'discovered', 'set', 'poor', 'packaging', 'apart', 'discs', 'freeze', 'skip', 'playback', 'are', 'routinely', 'scratched', 'etc', 'persistent', 'issues', 'may', 'be', 'dealbreaker', 'you.To', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'full', 'series', 'finally', 'being', 'made', 'available', 'one', 'box', 'even', 'single-season', 'volumes', 'have', ""n't"", 'all', 'been', 'realized', 'yet', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'purchasing', 'single-season', 'volumes', 'should', ""n't"", 'despair', ""'m"", 'sure', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'will', 'become', 'available', 'same', 'format', 'bought', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'probably', 'soon', 'full-series', 'box', 'out', 'fact', 'imagine', 'due', 'existence', 'full-series', 'box', 'remaining', 'single-season', 'volumes', 'will', 'be', 'published', 'much', 'faster', 'ones', 'prior.In', 'short', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'good', 'news', 'everyone', 'so', 'are', 'actual', 'problems', 'full-series', 'box', 'set', 'made', 'available', 'public', 'comments', 'concern', 'content', 'box', 'series', 'please', 'stop', 'underrating', 'item', 'box', 'sets', 'similar']",N/A

Besides I taped them when they were on TV to videos, and though they have commercials and they aren't picture perfect, at least I saved them, because at the time I didn't even know about DVD's.  Naturally I'd buy the DVD 5,6,7 if they were for sale, but since they're pulling this nasty deal on us, I'll not do it.The same thing happened with Bob Newhart, They only released one of Murphy Brown, Paper Chase, Fame  and a few others.

I bought them, but imo, it was better left to the first 4.  To begin with 5&6 should have been renamed the Ted Baxter show, because he was in every scene, and most stories were about him. He really got on my nerves.  Ted makes Lou look like an idiot, and Lou is supposed to be smart and tough.  Yet, a man like Ted would have been fired by a man like Lou in a minute in a real situation. 5&6 was too much Ted, no Rhoda for Mary to play off of, very little of Phillis, who though she got on my nerves, did it with class, and was such a great actress, she pulled it off.  Besides that, she wasn't in every single show, and sometimes when she was in a show, had a small part.  Crazy Ted took over the next 2 shows, 5 & 6 and he really got on my nerves.  So did the Happy Homemaker, whose only claim to script fame in 5&6 was hugging men. I don't know who wrote their scripts, but I could only stand to watched a few of them.  As to Mary's boy friend.  Give me a break.  He was a weirdo, and not the type Mary would have gone for.  She was better partnered with Dan. As I recall, Mary didn't end up with anyone.

Sure there were attempts to give her new friends in characters played by Penny Marshall and Mary Kay Place but they didn't last. Penny went to ""Laverne and Shirley"" and Mary Kay went to ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman"". With some exceptions like ""Chuckles Bites the Dust"" I wasn't as happy with the rest of the series run.

1233405,A3PK2JI32J58KJ,B001RIYVYK,"Scott J. Zuncic ""Scotty Z""","[2, 3]","I have to agree with all the reviewers here about the HUGE outcry for Fox not selling seasons 5, 6 and 7 as seasons sets and ending up having to purchase the complete series (including season 1-4 that most of us have already bought!!) in order to get the remaining seasons.  And YES, it does boil down to Fox's bottom line....corporate greed or whatever disgust you feel towards Fox Studios (I am in total agreement with all of you on this).However, despite all that.....are we shooting ourselves in the foot though?  Afterall, we do want these seasons 5-7. This show is a classic and is something we all enjoy (it's also a show that doesn't air to often on current t.v.). We complained for months and years that Fox was taking too long to come out with the remaining seasons.  And now were complaining that their coming out with the complete series (with the missing seasons) and knowing we may or may not see the remaining seasons in season sets?  We don't know yet really....the complete series is a definite....but will Fox eventually or for that fact, release at the same time, seasons 5,6 and 7 in individual season sets??? We really don't know that for sure yet.  The fact that they don't even have a detail description of extras, etc. or package art yet on Amazon is an indication that Fox maybe just testing us out to see what are reactions are?  I don't know....but I hate to jump on the bandwagon just yet.  Don't forget, T.V. on DVD, like most DVD products change release dates, specs often.  I am afraid if we crab about this too much....we won't get them at all.In speaking of the specs, another plus side of this is, another reviewer mentioned on here earlier, that he/she would be willing to consider buying the complete series if season 1 and season 2 episodes had a ""PLAY ALL"" feature on the DVD's.  The individual seasons sets of these 2 seasons currently do not offer a ""Play All"" feature....that is a very good point!!! I would love to see this feature on the complete series and I wouldn't mind shelling out for a ""Better Product"" in that sense.Another point I would like to relay to everyone, I wrote to Tvshowsondvd.com to tell them about the backlash towards Fox based on the Amazon reviews issued today alone.  I did get a response back, and I have to tell you they made a very good point.  We are getting a complete set of a series we all really enjoy.  We can not say that about alot of series that are still in limbo (a few that come to mind, All In The Family (still no sign of the last 3 seasons), Knots Landing (which is releasing a 2nd season in April....but it's been 3 years since the 1st season release and who knows if they (Warner Brothers in this case) will release seasons 3-14 in my lifetime) and the 1960's BATMAN....which may never be released to due ""rights issues"").  We should be at least thankful, we have the option to choose to buy or not buy something that we want. We can donate/sell on ebay/give to family or friends as gifts the duplicate seasons we all currently have. And its very possible, later on, if or when the complete series do not sell well....Fox may later break them out into individual seasons sets. We do have options.I am not disagreeing with any of you about Fox and the corporate practice they are unjustly doing to this DVD release (let alone to this wonder T.V. show classic). I am even surprised that Fox may continue to just release the complete series as we know of yet, knowing the economy is literally in the toliet right now. I just hope we are not speaking to fast before we get the full detail.  And BTW....this is not an Amazon issue....they are just relaying information that is provided by the product provider (in this case, Fox home video department).  I am sure Amazon would like the sales, but Amazon is just relaying the information....they are not the villians on how the DVD is being produced.I am just trying to make sense of it all madness!!! Whatever you decide, this type of product is more of a ""want"" than a ""need"".

I'm sure a lot of Mary Tyler Moore fans would (like me) have gladly considered buying the season sets for $35-40 each, especially since Fox has made it clear that part of the holdup on the remaining seasons stemmed from low sales.  A price increase wouldn't have bothered me. It's the idea of having to pay so much for what I already have that makes me sick.I really hope the company does an interview with TV Shows on DVD to explain their thinking, as they did when they faced a backlash over WKRP.

After so many long years, how can Fox reward such a patient and loyal customer with this new Complete Series available? Please Fox, BE FAIR! We have a new president who is getting rid of the big corporation's greedy CEO's who have in the past used their greed to put us all in the poor house! America will not tolerate greed being forced upon us any more! To make available only a complete set is the same as making us pay double, and that is intentional greed. I hope you realize how harmful greed is to an entire country and even globally. It's only fair that you put out the last 3 seasons separately as well, to those of us, that faithfully gave you our hard earned money for the first 4 seasons so many years ago. It's a new era, where we are getting rid of all the greed that took our country down, and I hope you become a part of it!

The DVDs are obviously being pressed, so it can't be that major an operation to offer them seperately or in a three-season set. Send 'em out just in blank paper protectors if you like.

1233412,A2J0XFLFPS3A4F,B001RIYVYK,Thomas W. Chilek,"[4, 11]","I am a big fan of the Mary Tyler Moore Show. In fact, it is my favorite of all television shows.  I loved everything about the show; the cast (clearly the best ever assembled on one sitcom), the storylines, and the theme song. I not only liked the opening credits, but I also loved the closing credits. I thought it was a very unique way to end the show, by showing episode clips of each cast member along with an instrumental reprisal of the theme song. My favorite characters are Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and Lou Grant (Edward Asner). I have always admired Mary's beauty, sophistication, grace, and charm.  She was also very funny. I believe Mary Tyler Moore's association with Dick Van Dyke on her previous series naturally helped her grow into a great comedic actress on her series. Ed Asner is a wonderful actor. I liked Lou's rough and readiness. A real no holds-barred, meat and potatoes kind of guy. The two of them together (Mary's sweetness and Lou's jagged approach) produced some of the most memorable scenes in television history. Lastly, my favorite show was from season 5, The episode was entitled, ""The System."" This was the episode where Lou, Murray, and Ted were betting on (and winning) NFL games by using Ted's betting system.  However, their fortunes would come to an abrupt end on Super Sunday.Maybe FOX could have handled all releases of MTM better. I was one of the consumers who wrote to FOX originally after they pulled the plug on the MTM after the season 1 release.  But today, I have to praise FOX for now releasing the entire MTM series because for a long time I thought this day would not come. I was one of those MTM fans who bought seasons 1-4 and then waited impatiently for the last three seasons to be released. However, when the announcement was made that FOX was releasing the final three seasons together in a complete series package along with the previously released seasons 1-4, frustration turned into jubilation. Season 1 was released in September 2002. Thus, I am more than willing to spend the extra money to get the complete series in May 2009 and be done with it.  At this time, I would like to take what's available. I don't want to wait around to see if FOX plans to release seasons 5, 6, and 7 individually. I may not outlive that. Sure, FOX's decision to release the complete series now is a money making ploy, but at the same time, I see it as a recognition by them that MTM was indeed one of the greatest TV series ever created and produced.Congratulations Mary Richards!!! Go ahead, toss your hat in the middle of a busy Minneapolis street. Love is all around no need to waste it. You made it after all and May 5, 2009 is graduation day.
