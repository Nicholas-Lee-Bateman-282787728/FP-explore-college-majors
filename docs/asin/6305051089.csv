On her journey, Sonia deals with extended family including a predatory brother-in-law and befriends a Puerto Rican artist (nicely portrayed by Allen Payne.)Along the way, the movie also deals with mysticism in the form of Sonia's dead brother and a homeless woman. Zellweger gives a good but subtle performance in her role.Apparently this movie was a huge subject of controversy when it was released. The Hasidic community reportedly took offense at their portrayal and the casting of the decidedly Waspish Zellweger in the lead role. Perhaps that's why it slipped under most people's radar.Their concern is understandable. When a group is rarely portrayed in the movies, any negative generalizations are a sensitive issue. But I think the controversy obscures what is in fact the movie's universal message. Individuals who feel that they don't belong in the community in which they've lived their entire lives and how or if they break out of that mold. The problem is not with the Hasidic community but with Sonia herself. She has to discover who she is. Unfortunately, Boaz Yakin may have been too subtle with his message and as a result most people missed it.For the most part, I enjoyed the movie. Like Fresh, Boaz Yakin's previous film, it's a bit uneven. (Interestingly, Fresh was a source of controversy in the African American community for it's subject matter. Perhaps this is a pattern with Yakin.)

The cast is generally good, with Ren&eacute;e Zellweger fresh off the success of Jerry Maguire and Julianna Margulies (ER) playing a strict and incredibly... cruel and judgmental Jewish woman. The story focuses on the Hasidic Jewish community and the new bride, played by Zellweger. Her husband is studying to become a rabbi and is so engrossed in those studies that their relationship suffers. The relationship also suffers because Zellweger's character is different. She needs something more than just marriage and motherhood to sustain her. She has her own opinions and needs and desires, and she eventually asserts them (after giving birth to a son) as a jewelry appraiser. Her father had been a jeweler (or perhaps he was also an appraiser), and she had a definite gift for this vocation. Her brother-in-law sets her up in the business and even gives her an office, but all conditional upon her engaging in a sexual affair with him, which she does, although not willingly. He will also be her ruin. When she takes an interest in a struggling artist and jewelry designer (I am not sure who he was, and this is when the story starts down a path that really went on too long and did not fit the spirit of the picture) the brother-in-law tells the rest of the family that Zellweger is having an affair with this artist.

Boullosa,"[54, 54]","I enjoyed this film very much, although I can see from the reviews that because it portrays negative aspects of a particular religious culture, it is receiving the usual reflexive denials from other members, as if one is obligated only to make movies that show all cultures as wonderful all the time!  For the man who asked what would happen if they made movies like this about blacks and Indians - well, first of all, they did, for decades, and this movie is not remotely on a par with those as reductions of an entire people or culture.  Someone who criticized the film didn't even watch it attentively enough to figure out that the ghostly child was Sonia's brother, not her ""childhood friend"", and then there's the illiterate review by someone who claims to be Jewish but complains about the movie being too Jewish . . . where do these people come from?!Unhappy marriages occur in cultures the world over, and while the story does expose some of the hypocrisies of Orthodox culture, it isn't, per se, about those hypocrisies, nor does it reduce Orthodox culture to them.  It's about Sonia Horowitz's struggle to find out where she really belongs - in doing so she makes huge mistakes and pays a heavy price for her dearly-bought self-knowledge.  I've known people who left communities like this one precisely because they couldn't handle the restrictions - that's not an indictment of Orthodox Judaism, it only demonstrates that not everyone born into a certain culture actually belongs there.The performances are excellent - special mention must go to Christopher Eccleston (a ""goy"" from Manchester, England, if you please!) for his coldly compelling performance as Sonia's amoral brother-in-law.  Eccleston, more familiar to mainstream audiences as the baleful Duke of Norfolk to Cate Blanchett's Elizabeth I, playing an Orthodox jeweler in Brooklyn's Borough Park, is one of those wonderful mysteries of art that one can only be glad about. His fine performance aside, one of the flaws of the film is that there is insufficient background for his character's utter lack of conscience - we are only told through the narration of one childhood incident that he has always been so.  Glenn Fitzgerald gives a sensitive performance as Mendel, Sonia's husband, as he struggles to come to terms with his wife's upheaval, and the dawning knowledge that they are dismally unsuited to each other.  Renee Zellwegger gives an emotionally fraught performance as Sonia - this actress is talented, but displays now-recognizable mannerisms that she needs to bring under control.  However, in this role, as the character is virtually having a nervous breakdown, these mannerisms served her well.  The rest of the cast is very believable, as well, including Julia Margulies as Sonya's overbearing sister-in-law.To say that a ""sincere Jew"" doesn't ignore his wife, as a reviewer below did, is absurd.  Mahatma Gandhi was a terrible husband and parent.  Sincere people everywhere do stupid things.  Sonia's husband is deeply involved with his spiritual life - Mendel's obsession with Talmudic law and spiritual goodness, while oblivious to his wife's emotional needs and sufferings until far too late, could be transposed to the marriage of any exceptionally dedicated spouse following a cause, career, or religious passion.  These conflicts are what give narratives tension and interest.The film doesn't pretend to be anything but the story of Sonia Horowitz's emotional and spiritual struggle to figure out who she really is.  I didn't take it any other way and only someone who is already bigoted would.The movie is worth seeing, and demonstrates the uncomfortable reality that marriage serves different purposes for different people - one may be content within a strictly defined role, and find all his or her needs met within that role, while another, for no identifiable reason, does not.",3,Thought Provoking . . .,1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,3881,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'can', 'see', 'reviews', 'negative', 'aspects', 'particular', 'religious', 'culture', 'receiving', 'usual', 'reflexive', 'denials', 'other', 'members', 'one', 'obligated', 'only', 'make', 'movies', 'show', 'cultures', 'wonderful', 'time', 'man', 'who', 'asked', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'made', 'movies', 'blacks', 'Indians', 'well', 'first', 'did', 'decades', 'movie', 'not', 'remotely', 'par', 'reductions', 'entire', 'people', 'culture', 'Someone', 'who', 'criticized', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'watch', 'attentively', 'enough', 'figure', 'out', 'ghostly', 'child', 'was', 'Sonia', 'brother', 'not', 'childhood', 'friend', 'then', 'illiterate', 'review', 'someone', 'who', 'be', 'Jewish', 'movie', 'being', 'too', 'Jewish', 'where', 'do', 'people', 'come', 'Unhappy', 'marriages', 'occur', 'cultures', 'world', 'story', 'expose', 'hypocrisies', 'Orthodox', 'culture', ""n't"", 'se', 'hypocrisies', 'reduce', 'Orthodox', 'culture', 'Sonia', 'Horowitz', 'struggle', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'really', 'doing', 'huge', 'mistakes', 'heavy', 'price', 'dearly-bought', 'self-knowledge', ""'ve"", 'known', 'people', 'who', 'left', 'communities', 'one', 'precisely', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'restrictions', 'not', 'indictment', 'Orthodox', 'Judaism', 'only', 'not', 'everyone', 'born', 'certain', 'culture', 'actually', 'there.The', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'special', 'mention', 'must', 'go', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'goy', 'Manchester', 'England', 'please', 'coldly', 'compelling', 'performance', 'Sonia', 'amoral', 'brother-in-law', 'Eccleston', 'more', 'familiar', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'baleful', 'Duke', 'Norfolk', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Elizabeth', 'playing', 'Orthodox', 'jeweler', 'Brooklyn', 'Borough', 'Park', 'one', 'wonderful', 'mysteries', 'art', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'glad', 'fine', 'performance', 'aside', 'one', 'flaws', 'film', 'insufficient', 'background', 'character', 'utter', 'lack', 'conscience', 'are', 'only', 'told', 'narration', 'one', 'childhood', 'incident', 'always', 'been', 'so', 'Glenn', 'Fitzgerald', 'sensitive', 'performance', 'Mendel', 'Sonia', 'husband', 'come', 'terms', 'wife', 'upheaval', 'dawning', 'knowledge', 'are', 'dismally', 'unsuited', 'other', 'Renee', 'Zellwegger', 'emotionally', 'fraught', 'performance', 'Sonia', 'actress', 'talented', 'now-recognizable', 'mannerisms', 'bring', 'control', 'However', 'role', 'character', 'virtually', 'having', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'mannerisms', 'served', 'well', 'rest', 'cast', 'very', 'believable', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'Julia', 'Margulies', 'Sonya', 'overbearing', 'sister-in-law.To', 'say', 'sincere', 'Jew', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'wife', 'reviewer', 'did', 'absurd', 'Mahatma', 'Gandhi', 'was', 'terrible', 'husband', 'parent', 'Sincere', 'people', 'everywhere', 'do', 'stupid', 'things', 'Sonia', 'husband', 'deeply', 'involved', 'spiritual', 'life', 'Mendel', 'obsession', 'Talmudic', 'law', 'spiritual', 'goodness', 'oblivious', 'wife', 'emotional', 'needs', 'sufferings', 'far', 'too', 'late', 'could', 'be', 'transposed', 'marriage', 'exceptionally', 'dedicated', 'spouse', 'following', 'cause', 'career', 'religious', 'passion', 'conflicts', 'are', 'what', 'give', 'narratives', 'tension', 'interest.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'anything', 'story', 'Sonia', 'Horowitz', 'emotional', 'spiritual', 'struggle', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'other', 'way', 'only', 'someone', 'who', 'already', 'bigoted', 'would.The', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'uncomfortable', 'reality', 'marriage', 'different', 'purposes', 'different', 'people', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'content', 'strictly', 'defined', 'role', 'find', 'needs', 'met', 'role', 'identifiable', 'reason', 'not']",Price Above Rubies VHS

It's not that I disrespect all Hasidim Jews, as I've never been around them, but I do disrespect all fundamentalist religions, regardless of which ones they are, and this portrayed a very fundamentalist Jewish family.  A nutty husband who hadn't a clue about women's sexuality.  That didn't make sense.  The Kabbalah, four important Jewish mystical books that Jewish men study, teaches that it is imperative that a man must satisfy his wife sexually, and that her sexual feelings come even before his.  This is ignored in the film.This husband is oblivious to anything about a woman.  He is an ignorant jerk.  So is his brother-in-law, a thief and his snotty wife.  What pompous irritating people they are.  I doubt that all Hasidim are this way, but I've read a few true stories, and some of this story probably doesn't fall too far from the truth.  Thank goodness, the vast majority of all Jews think nothing like they did.Renee Zelwegger, one of my favorite actresses, who can portray almost any character was very good, and that was the best part of the whole film.

The rest of the characters are ""extras"".  They have one collective soul, one collective attitude, which is probably the effect that the director was going for.  I can tell that the director has a huge chip on his shoulder.  It's obvious that he hates anything remotely traditional.  Apparently, only secular Jews deserve sympathy.

In the""real"" world, Princess Margaret had a lot of trouble fitting in with the rules and regulations encircling her.  In this fictional movie, the heroine, Sonia Horowitz, (Renee Zelwiger), definitely does NOT fit into her world -- that of the 20th century people living as close as they can to the ways of their ancestors, as Hassidic Jews in Borough Park, Brooklyn, New York.'A PRICE ABOVE RUBLES"" has many interesting applications.  The heroine is an intelligent, knowledgeable lady -- but her parents wanted her to marry and raise a family. Yet her husband -- a brilliant Hebrew school teacher and Torah scholar -- neglects her, taking her for granted as he savours the wonders of the Holy books instead.  As the new mother of a young son, she is reluctant to have him circumcised, and shows other signs of not being the model Hassidic woman she was brought up to be.  Yes, her parents brought her up to marry and be a mother -- but still, she knows a lot about the world of jewellery, as she did manage to learn a lot from her now-deceased father.  At a Sabbath dinner, (and the customs and ceremonies of the Hassidic community are well and truly shown -- in the Horowitz household and especially in the synagogue -- in all their splendour, noisiness, and claustrophobic atmosphere),  her husband's brother -- a jewellery dealer -- offers Sonia a job in his firm.  Most of the Hassidic women in the community DO work, (this is the 1990s, not the 1950s), and so Sonia's taking of this job is not, (at first), opposed much by her husband....In this job, Sonia meets a wider variety of people, far more often and in far closer proximity, than perhaps she has ever done before.  Blacks, (including one truly creative genius of a jewellery-designer), Puerto Ricans, and Indians, (from India), enter her life -- and it is a tribute to her, (and, yes, her brother-in-law, who sadly has other faults), that they do not call them ""svartzahs"" (Yiddish for ""blacks"", perjoratively)-- as many, (but not all) Jews do, in real life, (being a member of one minority group, sadly, does not automatically preclude one from looking down at other minority groups.)  Sonia is very good at her job -- but unfortunately, her bother-in-law sees her not just as star employee...but as sex object....Sonia's husband gradually becomes upset that she is at her job SO many hours of the day.  She has touched a wider world -- of many freedoms she never had before -- and he is aghast at them.  She no longer eats only kosher food when she is outside her home,  She sometimes forgets to pray three times a day.  Perhaps most grievous of all, she has begun to see herself as an independant person -- not merely her husband's wife....When her husband decides on divorce, he throws her out of their apartment.  He does not permit her to take their son with him.  His brother lets her into his apartment -- but it seems if she stays there, she will be paramour as well as employee.  She leaves him, as well -- but not before trying to take her belongings from the safe in the jewellery store owned by her brother-in-law, and where she formerly worked.  He refuses to open the safe for her --- leaving her totally destitute.  On the street, in despearation, she calls her mother -- who says she cannot come back to live in her childhood home, because her recent behaviour, now known throughout the Hassidic neighbourhood, would ruin her sisters' chances of finding a husband.Alone and desperate, Sonia meets again with a mysterious homeless woman, and a strange little boy, who have been turning up at all odd moments of this movie.  Sonia moves in with the homeless woman.  Looking around what looks to be a rickety attic, Sonia tells the homeless woman, ""You have nothing!""  To which the homeless woman replies, ""I have little.  It is you who have nothing.""How Sonia gets her life back -- from a truly unexpected source, (proving that some people -- even those you least expect -- will go with their feelings, instead of tradition), completes this involving, searing, and atmospheric drama.  But it does not complete Sonia's story.  One wishes that a ""Part Two"" of this movie could be made...................................................................................The actors, atmosphere, direction, costuming, dialogue, story, music, camera work, and all the other production values of this movie are first-rate.  Though one knows this is a story, the believabilty of the situations is always appearent.  So is the character of not just the Hassidic community -- but any close-knit, traditional community -- to those who want to go outside of it, and reach the wider world. It is warm and involving to those who like being in it -- but suffocatiinhg and claustrophobic to those who want to reach a wider world, and who feel they are more, and want to do more, than just what is expected of them, in these largely self-contained communities.  Princess Margaret........the Stepford Wives, (or the ""perfect 1950s housewife).........it's all the same.  Watching this movie, I wondered what Sonia had been like as a young girl, and if she had shown any rebelliousness then....In this movie, the character of Sonia suffered from the Jewish practice of ""Cherem""...or Jewish shunning.  This was the practice that was visited upon Benedict Spinoza, as well, and many others.  As a child, I remember MY rabbi telling the class that if we weren't religious, our parents would abandon us, and go twoards Judaism, instead.  Whether practiced or not -- and at whatever age -- Cherem, (and the Amish practice of ""Shunning"" -- which amount to the same thing), are co-ersive, and cause mental and physical anguish.  It is abuse -- abuse by the community agains the individual if it is actually done, and mental abuse is if is merely threatened.  (Children see only ""black and white"" about things, after all.  Shades of grey are often beyond their understanding.  It was with me: my parents kept kosher, said the blessings, had separate dishes -- so they were religious, right?  And they would throw me out of the house if I spoke of my dreams of wanting to marry a Christian prince, (there is no present-day Israeli monarchy, after all, right?)  Not realizing that I was and am an ""Indigo"" person, (one of the characteristics of which is to be obcessed with ALL things Royal) -- and not then even knowing what ""Indigo"" people are, (whoever heard of ""Indigo"" people in the 1950s and early 1960s?), the fact that my parents ALSO gave my sister and me piano and ballet lessons on Saturday, and sometimes criticised the heirarchy of the synagogue and it's practices, just didn't register with me as a child.  I only knew they followed the CEREMONIES of Judaism....and so could never be 100% sure that they -- who were THE most loving parents in the world -- really did love me.  Thi threat of ""cherem"", in my case, amounted to nothing less than unrealized, but very real mental child abuse -- and, though unknown to anyone, parental abuse as well. I hope the many, many Indigo children being born today -- some of them, no doubt, Jewish -- will not suffer as I have suffered -- and I mention my problems not only as personal catharsis, but as a warning to parents, children -- and rabbis, alike.Do NOT threaten cherem as a CERTAINTY.  Do NOT lump all parents -- and all religious Jews -- together!  (I recently read in Wikipedia that Cherem, by and large, has NOT been practiced since the Enlightenment!  But my 1960s rabbi seemed not to have been ""enlightened"" about this!)  Threatening little Catholic children with being put into Hell is likewise abominable.  Nightmares -- and worse -- can evolve from such a threat!  These practices ruin lives, and if they do not always ruin sanity, they come mightly close to it.  Do these traditional societies want members SO badly that they must twist and turn minds, (and hearts), to reach their required quota of religious Jews, or Catholics, or whatever?  Isn't it better to have JUST those people in these groups who SINCERELY WANT to be in them?  (And there ARE enough of these people, in every generation, believe me.)  Twisting minds, hearts, and lives, to achieve the greatest number of adherents is akin to an ""intra-community mental Inquisition""!  In my opinion, such practices as Cherem, Shunning, (or the threat of same), the warning that Hell is near for those who don't practice and don't believe, should be banned in all civilized countries!  (After all, would a truly LOVING God condone such practices?????? (!)Sonia, however, lives through her period of ""cherem"", and is released from it by, as I have mentined, a most unexpected source.  This movie, ""A PRICE ABOVE RUBIES"", is in itself something which can claim to be a price above rubles.  Showing people who value tradition above human lives, even when those lives are those of members of their family -- and the anguish practices such as ""shunning"" and ""cherem"" bring, is something not dealt with, to my knowledge, in movies before.  Though not a ""message"" movie, per se, one would hope. at least, that members of all deeply religious and traditional groups which have such punishments for those who think differently and for themselves, see this movie.  And re-think these practices, as they see the damages they can cause!",5,S H O W S........S U F F O C A T I O N.......F O R.......W H A T.....I T.....I S,1307750400,"06 11, 2011",2011,9369,"['Anyone',

If you like Chaim Potok's books, you will like a Price Above Rubies, for it has some of the same elements in this tale of a person who doesn't quite fit in the society in which they were born. There is also the mystical elements that remind one of ""The Book of Lights."" This movie is a good dramatization of the break that sometimes happens between the individual and society.As for performances, Zellweiger is wonderful as Sonya.  Julianna M. ditto as the conservative and fiercely protective Rachel.  I went through the movie frustrated by the characterization of the husband, particularly when he refuses to listen or deal with Sonya. But then at the end, when he is so innocently looking at all the religious relics in Ramon's house, and then tells Sonya to come and visit their son, you can see the goodness in him and that he is well deserving of the tzaddik name.  Likewise the Rabbi and his wife were also good and accepting people. It is only a few individuals who can't look beyond personal interests who were bad, not the religion or community as a whole.  The brother is well played as an interesting and complex villian.While I'm sure this was no favorite in the Orthodox community, it isn't Orthodoxy that is at fault -- indeed, Orthodoxy is redeemed by Mendel's behavior at the end, when he accepts her for what she is and they part respectfully and by the council of the Rebbe and his wife. It is simply that Sonya was searching for something that she could not find in her own community.Definitely watch this movie if you are interested in such themes.

445384,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305051089,Reviewer,"[3, 6]","The self-imposed standards regarding matters of faith to which an individual must adhere, the priorities one sets, and giving precedence to one matter of importance at the expense of another are issues addressed in ""A Price Above Rubies,"" written and directed by Boaz Yakin and starring Renee Zellweger.  After the birth of her first child, a son, a young New York City woman, Sonia Horowitz (Zellweger), struggles with emotional and sexual frustration as she attempts to cope with the extreme ideals of her husband, Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald), an Hasidic Jew who holds God above all things, including his wife and their marriage.  Mendel is a good man, a holy man, but in his youthful zeal to please God and live according to His Word, he woefully neglects Sonia, a fact to which he has been blinded by his religious fervor.  His devotion to God is so all consuming that he is not only unable to meet, but is unaware of, the needs of his wife.Sonia is a good wife and mother, a good person who loves God, but is simply incapable of effecting Mendel's degree of devotion and sacrifice.  His concerns are of a spiritual nature, while hers are more immediate.  Increasingly discontent and striving for a means through which she can rise above the stature of non-entity bestowed upon her by Mendel, her life takes a turn only when her brother-in-law, Sender (Christopher Eccleston), intercedes on her behalf.  A jeweler by trade, Sender sees a value in Sonia that he likens to a price above rubies, but his efforts soon prove to be a mixed blessing for her, as ultimately her life becomes more complicated than ever.Yakin is to be commended for his objective approach to this story; any judgment of those involved is left to God and the audience.  He neither condemns Mendel for his-- what may be deemed by some-- excessive piety, nor does he absolve him of it's implications.  By the same token, he neither condemns nor absolves Sonia for her actions.  And by avoiding any subjective judgment of the characters, it heightens the impact of the film in that it forces the involvement of the individual viewer, who must then decide if what has transpired is appropriate or not.  It's a very subtle and effective way of drawing in the audience, wisely employed by Yakin, as it maintains a balance in the film while allowing the actions of the characters to speak for themselves.As Sonia, Zellweger turns in an excellent, understated performance, through which she makes you feel the exasperation of this woman in need of self-esteem and acknowledgement.  There's something of Ibsen's ""A Doll's House"" in this story, for Sonia (like Ibsen's Nora) is not motivated by selfishness, but by the desire for her family to be able to function as a whole, and to be, herself, an invaluable part of that whole.  It's a selfless pursuit for recognition and equality, rather than an ego driven quest for autonomy, and because of this it is easy to empathize with her.  Zellweger does not play Sonia for sympathy, though it would be the easy road to take with this character; she opts instead for credibility in her actions and reactions, and succeeds with an honest portrayal that makes her entirely believable.Fitzgerald also gives a solid performance as Mendel, a man you are neither able to like nor dislike, mainly because Fitzgerald does such a good job of maintaining the integrity of the character.  And as Sender, Eccleston does a notable turn, as well, and again the filmmaker's objectivity in presenting the relationship between the brothers adds that ring of truth that makes the contrast between the two convincing.The supporting cast includes Julianna Margulies (Rachel), Allen Payne (Ramon), Kim Hunter (Rebbitzn), John Randolph (Rebbe Moshe), Kathleen Chalfant (Beggar Woman), Edie Falco (Feiga), Shelton Dane (Yossi) and Jackie Ryan (Young Sonia).  Yakin's delicate handling of the sensitive subject matter, as well as the unqualified non-judgmental tone of the film, puts the value of ""A Price Above Rubies"" at a cut above the usual drama that seeks to deal with the issues of religious ardor.  The ending of the film may not resolve the matters at hand to every viewer's satisfaction, but it's honest, and consistent with the rest of the story.  What minor flaws the film may contain can be easily overlooked in light of Zellweger's memorable performance, and the fact that it proffers an emotionally complex and involving experience, especially for the discerning viewer.",4,Memorable Performance By Zellweger,987724800,"04 20, 2001",2001,4471,"['self-imposed', 'standards', 'regarding', 'matters', 'faith', 'individual', 'must', 'adhere', 'priorities', 'one', 'sets', 'giving', 'precedence', 'one', 'matter', 'importance', 'expense', 'are', 'issues', 'addressed', 'A', 'Price', 'Above', 'Rubies', 'written', 'directed', 'Boaz', 'Yakin', 'starring', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'birth', 'first', 'child', 'son', 'young', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'woman', 'Sonia', 'Horowitz', 'Zellweger', 'emotional', 'sexual', 'frustration', 'cope', 'extreme', 'ideals', 'husband', 'Mendel', 'Glenn', 'Fitzgerald', 'Hasidic', 'Jew', 'who', 'God', 'things', 'including', 'wife', 'marriage', 'Mendel', 'good', 'man', 'holy', 'man', 'youthful', 'zeal', 'please', 'God', 'live', 'according', 'Word', 'woefully', 'Sonia', 'fact', 'been', 'blinded', 'religious', 'fervor', 'devotion', 'God', 'so', 'all', 'consuming', 'not', 'only', 'unable', 'meet', 'unaware', 'needs', 'wife.Sonia', 'good', 'wife', 'mother', 'good', 'person', 'who', 'God', 'simply', 'incapable', 'effecting', 'Mendel', 'degree', 'devotion', 'sacrifice', 'concerns', 'are', 'spiritual', 'nature', 'hers', 'are', 'more', 'immediate', 'Increasingly', 'discontent', 'striving', 'means', 'can', 'rise', 'stature', 'non-entity', 'bestowed', 'Mendel', 'life', 'turn', 'only', 'when', 'brother-in-law', 'Sender', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'behalf', 'jeweler', 'trade', 'Sender', 'value', 'Sonia', 'price', 'rubies', 'efforts', 'soon', 'prove', 'be', 'mixed', 'blessing', 'ultimately', 'life', 'more', 'complicated', 'ever.Yakin', 'be', 'commended', 'objective', 'approach', 'story', 'judgment', 'involved', 'left', 'God', 'audience', 'neither', 'Mendel', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'deemed', 'excessive', 'piety', 'absolve', 'implications', 'same', 'token', 'neither', 'Sonia', 'actions', 'avoiding', 'subjective', 'judgment', 'characters', 'impact', 'film', 'involvement', 'individual', 'viewer', 'who', 'must', 'then', 'decide', 'transpired', 'appropriate', 'not', 'very', 'subtle', 'effective', 'way', 'drawing', 'audience', 'wisely', 'employed', 'Yakin', 'balance', 'film', 'allowing', 'actions', 'characters', 'speak', 'themselves.As', 'Sonia', 'Zellweger', 'excellent', 'understated', 'performance', 'feel', 'exasperation', 'woman', 'need', 'self-esteem', 'acknowledgement', 'something', 'Ibsen', 'A', 'Doll', 'House', 'story', 'Sonia', 'Ibsen', 'Nora', 'not', 'motivated', 'selfishness', 'desire', 'family', 'be', 'able', 'function', 'whole', 'be', 'invaluable', 'part', 'whole', 'selfless', 'pursuit', 'recognition', 'equality', 'rather', 'ego', 'driven', 'quest', 'autonomy', 'easy', 'empathize', 'Zellweger', 'not', 'play', 'Sonia', 'sympathy', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'road', 'take', 'character', 'instead', 'credibility', 'actions', 'reactions', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'entirely', 'believable.Fitzgerald', 'also', 'solid', 'performance', 'Mendel', 'man', 'are', 'able', 'like', 'dislike', 'mainly', 'Fitzgerald', 'good', 'job', 'maintaining', 'integrity', 'character', 'Sender', 'Eccleston', 'notable', 'turn', 'as', 'well', 'again', 'filmmaker', 'objectivity', 'presenting', 'relationship', 'brothers', 'ring', 'truth', 'contrast', 'two', 'convincing.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'Rachel', 'Allen', 'Payne', 'Ramon', 'Kim', 'Hunter', 'Rebbitzn', 'John', 'Randolph', 'Rebbe', 'Moshe', 'Kathleen', 'Chalfant', 'Beggar', 'Woman', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'Feiga', 'Shelton', 'Dane', 'Yossi', 'Jackie', 'Ryan', 'Young', 'Sonia', 'Yakin', 'delicate', 'handling', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'matter', 'as', 'well', 'unqualified', 'non-judgmental', 'tone', 'film', 'value', 'A', 'Price', 'Above', 'Rubies', 'cut', 'usual', 'drama', 'deal', 'issues', 'religious', 'ardor', 'ending', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'resolve', 'matters', 'hand', 'viewer', 'satisfaction', 'honest', 'consistent', 'rest', 'story', 'What', 'minor', 'film', 'may', 'contain', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'light', 'Zellweger', 'memorable', 'performance', 'fact', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'involving', 'experience', 'especially', 'discerning', 'viewer']",Price Above Rubies VHS

I could see this film holding just about as relevant even if I replaced the community potrayed in it with any other. It is about the marital suffering of two people who are very different in their moorings.Renee Zellweger, the pivot, does a very convincing job of showing the desperation in a young woman's personal search,  Sonia, who embarks on a search for not only herself but also her place in the world -- for the duration of the film Renee gave Sonia the precise dignity and emotion that the role deserved.The supporting cast were strong, Juliana Margulies certainly showing that she's doesn't always play the 'nice girl'. Christopher Eccleston was convincingly wicked and Glenn Fitzgerald puts in a credible performance as Mendel, the husband, capturing the essence of the role commendably.Bordering sometimes on being a chick-flick, the movie generally deals with feminine issues, and I would think that the emotional dominion would have it seldom appeal to a male audience.

445388,A30OXD42ZFYZLO,6305051089,Thomas Keneally,"[14, 23]","Boaz Yakin's movie is the story of a woman caught in an unhappy marriage. This is an extremely wrong and depressing portrayal of orthodox Judiasm. I can point out so many instances. It starts right from the marriage, the orthodox Jewish weddings are wonderful occasions, this looks like a funeral. There are so many wrong interpretations of the bible that anyone would be offended. The worst is the Rabbi who disregards his wife, though he is such a great scholar. Some call him ""Moshe Rabbenu"". I will not go into details but no sincere Jew is allowed to disregard his wife, there is a mitzwah against it. The part where he dies and his wife comes and and thanks Renee is the silliest of all. The way the entire community is portrayed makes me think that I am looking at some other community, though I partly belong to it. Every community has its positives and negatives, but showing the negatives alone is wrong. This is a unique community that has great positives, attachment to family, scholarly spirit, artistic tendencies and so on that have been shown over generations. Some of the great american writers such as Saul Bellow came from such families. While the characters are acted well, it is totally silly and fictional.

445389,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,6305051089,Tsuyoshi,"[19, 23]","Thanks to the critical and commercial success of ""Briget Jones' Diary"" in Japan, lovely Renee Zellweger's long-belated drama has been released theatrically here.  But the film seems to be seeking for its audience desperately, for when I was watching it, I could find only three audiences in theatre (maybe that's because it was Tuesday evening.  Maybe.)Anyway, the film deserves more audiences not least because it shows one of Renne's best performance as Sonia, who lives in an Orthodox Jewish community.  If you remember Harrison Ford's ""Witness,"" the way of their life is easily pictured to yourself, and Sonia knows she has ""a burning fire"" within herself.  Actually, sexual desire or yearning for the world outside, whatever it is, it is so hot that she feels burnt within herself (and tells that the rabi, who meets unexpected fate with his wife).  Clearly discontented with her husband who is too occupied with studying the mystery of the religion, Sonia finds her husband's brother Sender is interested in her and her ability to evaluate jewelery.  But Sender's interest turns out  more than that.If ""A Price above Rubies"" is not set in Jewish community, the plot may sound more ordinary and even banal, as a decently made, but not so special knowing-one's-self story.  As it is, the film, you might think, will put of some of the viewers because of its negative descriptions of the community.  I expected that way, but I found the fact is more complicated; first of all, except for some of the characters, the Jewish people are not shown in a negative light.  Christopher Eccleston's character Sender looks roguish in the end, and Julianna Margulies' Rechel obviously represent the aspect of narrow-mindedness, but these elements can be seen in any community.  And it should be noted that Sonia's husband is not drawn in one-sided way, finally showing his best side to his wife.  Probably director Boaz Yakin knows more than most of us about the Jewish people, so we should leave tje matter there.Another factor that might surprise you is that the film employs a fable-like storytelling, introduing in the begining the two characters that might not exist.  They come back to Sonia, telling and listening to her, revealing the inner voice of her to the viewers.  This might be interesting to some, but I find that simply unnecessary because the strong performance of Renne Zellweger tells everything about this interesting heroine Sofia, and if only to watch her, the film is worth your money.As Rabbe you can find John Randolph, and as Rebbitznm Kim Hunter (that lovely female ape in original ""Planet of the Ape"")  Interestingly, both actors are once blacklisted during the time of McCarthyism.",4,Watch Strong Performance of Renee Carry the Whole Drama,1026777600,"07 16, 2002",2002,2703,"['Thanks', 'critical', 'commercial', 'success', 'Briget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'Japan', 'lovely', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'long-belated', 'drama', 'been', 'released', 'theatrically', 'here', 'film', 'be', 'seeking', 'audience', 'desperately', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'could', 'find', 'only', 'three', 'audiences', 'theatre', 'maybe', 'was', 'Tuesday', 'evening', 'Maybe', 'Anyway', 'film', 'more', 'audiences', 'not', 'least', 'one', 'Renne', 'best', 'performance', 'Sonia', 'who', 'Orthodox', 'Jewish', 'community', 'remember', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Witness', 'way', 'life', 'easily', 'pictured', 'Sonia', 'burning', 'fire', 'Actually', 'sexual', 'desire', 'yearning', 'world', 'whatever', 'so', 'hot', 'burnt', 'rabi', 'who', 'unexpected', 'fate', 'wife', 'Clearly', 'discontented', 'husband', 'who', 'too', 'occupied', 'studying', 'mystery', 'religion', 'Sonia', 'husband', 'brother', 'Sender', 'interested', 'ability', 'evaluate', 'jewelery', 'Sender', 'interest', 'out', 'more', 'that.If', 'A', 'Price', 'Rubies', 'not', 'set', 'Jewish', 'community', 'plot', 'may', 'sound', 'more', 'ordinary', 'even', 'banal', 'decently', 'made', 'not', 'so', 'special', ""knowing-one's-self"", 'story', 'film', 'might', 'think', 'will', 'put', 'viewers', 'negative', 'descriptions', 'community', 'expected', 'way', 'found', 'fact', 'more', 'complicated', 'first', 'characters', 'Jewish', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'shown', 'negative', 'light', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'character', 'Sender', 'roguish', 'end', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'Rechel', 'obviously', 'represent', 'aspect', 'narrow-mindedness', 'elements', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'community', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Sonia', 'husband', 'not', 'drawn', 'one-sided', 'way', 'finally', 'showing', 'best', 'side', 'wife', 'Probably', 'director', 'Boaz', 'Yakin', 'more', 'most', 'Jewish', 'people', 'should', 'leave', 'tje', 'matter', 'there.Another', 'factor', 'might', 'surprise', 'film', 'fable-like', 'storytelling', 'introduing', 'begining', 'two', 'characters', 'might', 'not', 'exist', 'come', 'back', 'Sonia', 'telling', 'listening', 'revealing', 'inner', 'voice', 'viewers', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'find', 'simply', 'unnecessary', 'strong', 'performance', 'Renne', 'Zellweger', 'everything', 'interesting', 'heroine', 'Sofia', 'only', 'watch', 'film', 'money.As', 'Rabbe', 'can', 'find', 'John', 'Randolph', 'Rebbitznm', 'Kim', 'Hunter', 'lovely', 'female', 'ape', 'original', 'Planet', 'Ape', 'Interestingly', 'actors', 'are', 'once', 'blacklisted', 'time', 'McCarthyism']",Price Above Rubies VHS

While working for him, she meets a Puerto Rican jewelry designer and artist whose work gives her joy but she also encounters grief by meeting him.
