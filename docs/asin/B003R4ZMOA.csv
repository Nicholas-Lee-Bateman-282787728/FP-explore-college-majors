Over the years I have come to enjoy Larry even more than Jerry as Larry is willing to take his comedy further.  It is tempting therefore to instantly compare Louie C.K. to both comics and his show to theirs.  And, above all, to compare all three to the early Woody Allen, who carved out his early career in tv, standup and comic movies.The hugest difference right off the bat is that Louie is NOT JEWISH. If you are fans of the other three, this is a HUGE difference because the other three derive a lot of their comedy from being part of the Jewish American culture set in New York City.  Louie also is a single father with joint custody who takes care of his two daughters half of every week in a very hands on way.  No one can picture the other three doing anything of the sort.Yet there is still a striking similarity and I think it is to do with all of them train a macroscopic lens on their personal lives with their comedy. No detail of making it through the day intact is left uncovered by any of them. Another similarity is that they are all disasters with women in their comedic personas.If you are a fan of Jerry and Larry, you need to immerse yourself in several episodes of Louie to quiet your tendency to expect it to be SEINFELD or CURB.  By about the third or fourth episode, you are totally into Louie C.K. and are no longer comparing him to Jerry and Larry.

He doesn't have the BEST luck in the world, he doesn't have SELF CONFIDENCE, his behavior or life seldom changes, most of his jokes are SELF DEPRECATING and outcomes of shows are predictable, never does Louie do anything that will make the viewer feel the show is morally uplifting. It is a safe show and there is nothing that can be earned from it but then where my complaint lies about this show is exactly what I like about this show to keep me bringing back. I am always curious about Louie, it will not be wrong to say the show is a spin off on a lot of people in New York. This brings me to my take on this show, I think it's a very HONEST show, I think the show never tries to show a life that cannot be lived or believed in. The protagonist knows his life is not changing, he doesn't stick to any hobby for long.I would recommend this show to fans of Curb Your Enthusiasm (which is a much better show) who are looking for something more cynical, downtrodden and well overall gloomy, yet real.This is the gloomiest comedy show on television and it's winning all records.

The video quality on these episodes is very uneven, particularly for very dark scenes.

1360300,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003R4ZMOA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[29, 32]","Somehow, the FX Network has become the go-to channel for cutting edge entertainment.  Their successful comedy line-up features some of the brightest and most daring programs on the air--embracing an outrageous lewdness that regular network TV doesn't touch.  Louis CK is certainly a talented comedian and I've followed his exploits for many years.  But in truth, I was no huge fan of his short-lived HBO endeavor ""Lucky Louie.""  With so many peripheral characters, this non-traditional family sitcom simply spread itself too thin and never felt particularly cohesive.  There were moments of brilliance, but the ""everything but the kitchen sink"" approach to comedy never really allowed a closeness to the main characters.  I say this not to be berated by its fans (which will happen) but to explain that I almost didn't watch ""Louie.""  And that would have been a big mistake.  Here, Louis CK has refined his character (pretty much playing himself) into a lovably awkward every man struggling to get by.I feel, without a doubt, that this is his break-through moment and performance.  Incorporating comedy club footage into each episode (but to more laughs and purpose than Seinfeld did), some of these sets are fall-on-the-floor funny.  Pushing past the edge of good taste, Louis CK leads you right into the crudest scenarios possible but never loses you.  I won't contend that this was the best show of the year--but it easily had some of the biggest singular laughs of the current TV season.  Interspersed within the club material, we see Louie struggle with life's daily misadventures.  Whether taking care of his daughters or exploring the dating realm, this is a guy you can identify with and share in his frustrations and challenges.  I feel like Louis CK really lets the viewer into his world and invites us to partake in the unified silliness of humanity.Of course, Louis CK is the primary creative force behind the show so it's refreshing to see such openness.  And it really does pay off.  As with any sitcom, you will have your favorite episodes.  Season One consists of 13 complete shows (even though as of 4/27/11, Amazon has the runtime of this DVD listed incorrectly as 23 minutes).  A particular favorite in our household was the recurring character of Ricky Gervais--and old friend of Louie and a doctor on the show.  The irrepressible Gervais lives to torture his old buddy and the humor in these sequences is so disturbingly wrongheaded, it borders on offensive genius.  ""Louie"" may not be for the most sensitive of viewers--it is not an old fashioned sitcom--but if you like a little edge and bite, I'd definitely say you should give this a try!  Season Two pops up on FX on Thursday, June 23--so they haven't given you much time to catch up via DVD.  But it's an easy recommendation--and from someone who almost didn't watch the show!

1360306,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003R4ZMOA,Mark Turner,"[15, 104]","So I'm starting here with that simple statement, I don't get it. And I just don't. I watched this series just released on DVD and found that I just didn't get the attraction or rave reviews the show has garnered. For a comedy show about a comedian I found it offered very few laughs.LOUISE tells the story of comedian Louie (played by Louis C.K.). Just divorced and a doting father, it tells of his everyday life and what happens in it. Some moments are touching, some funny and some just perplexing. But it's his life and so we watch what happens. We try to relate to the situations he finds himself in. And short of living in New York I don't think many people do find themselves in most of these situations.The series covers such topics as dating after divorce, trying to raise kids, having fights with your friends and more. Intermingled with the stories are a few comedic moments but for the most part each episode just feels dry and lacking something. Laughs perhaps?The series has received all sorts of accolades and comparisons to other series like CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM. I might be in the minority here but that's a series I've never seen. And if it's anything like this one I doubt I'd ever want to.So what is it about series like this that make people rush to praise them and talk about how wonderful they are? Why is it that shows concerning themselves with the miseries of someone trying to get on with life are entertaining? All I saw here was a man who had great friends but had trouble with a love life or a life at home. Isn't that the life that most people lead? Aren't we all having problems we have to confront and find solutions for daily? And if so and I'm living this, why would I find it entertaining watching someone else do what I do every day? Well I mean with the exception that I'm not making nearly as much money or on TV each week.I've seen Louis C.K.'s stand up act and know he can be quite entertaining and funny. But there's a difference between writing a stand up routine that is fine tuned over so many weeks on the road and trying to make up new jokes or funny antics on a weekly basis. The episodes I made it through here felt like they were one joke ideas that entire episodes were then built around. A single joke with plenty of filler. It would be as if a regular hamburger were placed on a Big Mac bun and covered with double toppings. Sure the meat was there but it was so covered by other items that you couldn't enjoy it.I don't know. Perhaps over time I will get what everyone else is saying about shows like these. Perhaps I won't want to. Until then I'll watch things that make me laugh, make me cry, keep me on the edge of my seat or make me jump out of it. As for now I think I'll pass by this one. You should too unless you like something so far off the wall that you can't even find that wall.I know I'll be raked over the coals by fans who adore the show as has happened to me before here.

I did not expect the profound depth from a sitcom comedy show. Sure you expect some funny jokes (since Louis CK really is a skilled and talented comedian as many of us already know) but his outlooks on life and the scenarios sketched display a kind of humanity and character that puts contemporary TV to shame. This may sound pretentious but I assure you that the careful viewer will see it in the show but Louie is remarkably good at showing the sublime in the everyday. The most touching shows I've seen are in season one.For example, one episode has Louie on a date with a woman he clearly is smitten with. When they are having a coffee at a local joint they unfortunately are seated next to some obnoxious high school jocks and they relentlessly bully, humiliate and intimidate Louis in front of his date. The scene is so skillfully written and directed (both by Louis CK himself) you can't help but feel all the emotions of anger, fear, helplessness, disappointment, humiliation someone in that position must feel. Louie's date looses her attraction for him at the pitiful sight of him not ""standing up"" for himself despite the fact that he showed remarkable poise and courage in not responding to the bullying by sinking to their level. Again, one is magnetically drawn to identify with Louie's unfortunately predicament. Later Louie is so understandably angered and upset he follows one of his tormentors home and has a talk with his parents. We then learn from that exchange that the bully obviously comes from an abusive home and then we identify with the bully in turn. So this one show shows the profound nuances of life and I think any decent person can identify with Louie's moral tribulations in these scenarios. What's amazing is that Louis CK shows all this profound depth while still displaying the absurdity and humor in life too! What more do you want from a show? Other episode are just as memorable such as the flashback episode of Louie's loss of faith as a child and his touching interactions with his mother.I've seen the other seasons of Louie as well. While still very good, they don't approach this first season's profundity and heart which as I've said, I think makes it a classic. What is amazing is that Louis CK was the sole writer, director producer and editor of this show and managed to make it on a spartan budget and using home editing software. Life is hard but Louie shows that there is also humanity and humor in it as well.

Turning it into a more realized attempt at Seinfeld's ""a show about nothing"" tagline (i.e. Slice Of Life). It's really hard to nail down what makes this show so perfect, but Louie's genuine likeability as a fat, balding underdog of a stand-up performer has something to do with it I'm sure. You want him succeed, but at the same time, you also want him to fail miserably.The show is intertwined with transitions between Louie's stand up act and poignant vignettes that are at times both humorous and melancholy. One of my favorites is the season 3 two-parter, ""Daddy's Girlfriend"", where Louie's daughters encourage him to get back on the ""dating horse"". He later bumps into an book store clerk named Liz (played by Parker Posey) and falls madly in love with her. But as they venture out into the neon playground of late night New York, Louie realizes how much of a broken human being Liz is, regardless of how perfect she appears to be.Another aspect that I really do enjoy is the use of classic blues, jazz, and R&B; from the 40's-60's as the show's background music. It adds an entirely new dimension to the vignettes that I feel deserves to be celebrated in every possible respect considering that shows these days are so concerned with using the latest hits to appeal to a younger, savvier audience.In short, I can not say enough good things about this show.

1360325,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B003R4ZMOA,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[0, 1]","I was under the impression that TV comedy had died years ago and a half-wit warlock  resurrected it, lumbering and Zombie-like, as ADHD crap like ""Family Guy"" and ""Robot Chicken"" or cookie-cutter detritus like ""Two and half Men"" and ""How I Met Your Mother.""  You know, where you get the impression that the people making the show are laughing more than the people watching it . . . and the former is not really laughing all that much either.  ""Louie"" is the zombie apocalypse survivor who makes it through the night, pushes open the storm cellar door, and emerges with a shotgun, justifiably ready to blow the heads off whatever is still dumb enough to be staggering around.  It's written, directed, and headlined by Louis C.K., who looks more like the guy who rents you a U-Haul than a stand-up comedian, but that's perfect.  He is the master of timing, especially the slow burn, generally playing straight man in a world that makes little sense and therefore is a lot like ours, flashing a lightning-fast wit just often enough to remind you, thank God, somebody else out there gets it.  The show takes a page from ""Seinfeld"" -- and that's a supreme compliment -- in its jokes and set ups, commenting on the minutiae of daily life, relationships, self esteem, responsibility, and so forth, even though its aesthetic is more mopey than jokey.  Think ""Seinfeld"" on Xanax and with much more pathos, ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" without the smarm.  Louis C.K. plays a modern everyman, a divorced 40-something trying to figure out just what the heck happened while a confusing world swirls around him with more intent than purpose.  It has the guts to ask the questions people really have and to not always give them the answers they want, albeit with laughs.  A standout episode, for instance, features the ever date-hungry Louie finally coaxing a woman out, then convincing her to stay out a little longer at a donut shop, only to have the night ruined by a group of dumbass teenagers who turn Louie's badly conceived effort to be the grown-up in the room into an exercise in emasculation.  It's painful to watch, but it's the metaphor for Louie's life as a flawed man struggling to do what's right even when he isn't sure what that is.  When his date takes the gesture as a personal humiliation for her -- she understands why Louie does it but nonetheless feels he's a loser and ends the date -- we're reminded of why Louie is the conscience-addled square peg in a world of narcissistic round a-holes.  Believe it or not, there are some laughs in there, but how the episode resolves itself, especially when Louie follows one of the teenagers home and we're not sure what he or the punk's parents are going to do, is the essence of a good The New Yorker story.  ""Edgy"" is an overused word, and almost always misapplied, but ""Louie"" is edgy in its authenticity and more like listening to real people tell you their problems while chuckling over a beer.  The show has a Gen-Xer's sarcasm, but a better description would be say that it's ""adult,"" so that when we see Louie struggle through an awkward first date or suffer the travails of modern air travel, it's less about the gags and more about the truth people face in their lives.  Observations are grounded in reality rather than silliness, and that makes them all the more funny.",5,Just When I Thought TV Comedy was Dead . . . or Should be Euthanized,1342137600,"07 13, 2012",2012,3324,"['was', 'impression', 'TV', 'comedy', 'had', 'died', 'years', 'ago', 'half-wit', 'warlock', 'resurrected', 'lumbering', 'Zombie-like', 'ADHD', 'crap', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Robot', 'Chicken', 'cookie-cutter', 'detritus', 'Two', 'half', 'Men', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'know', 'where', 'get', 'impression', 'people', 'making', 'show', 'are', 'laughing', 'more', 'people', 'watching', 'former', 'not', 'really', 'laughing', 'much', 'Louie', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'survivor', 'who', 'night', 'pushes', 'open', 'storm', 'cellar', 'door', 'shotgun', 'justifiably', 'ready', 'blow', 'heads', 'still', 'dumb', 'enough', 'be', 'staggering', 'around', 'written', 'directed', 'headlined', 'Louis', 'C.K.', 'who', 'more', 'guy', 'who', 'U-Haul', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'perfect', 'master', 'timing', 'especially', 'slow', 'burn', 'generally', 'playing', 'straight', 'man', 'world', 'little', 'sense', 'therefore', 'lot', 'ours', 'flashing', 'lightning-fast', 'wit', 'just', 'often', 'enough', 'remind', 'thank', 'God', 'somebody', 'else', 'there', 'show', 'page', 'Seinfeld', 'supreme', 'compliment', 'jokes', 'set', 'ups', 'commenting', 'minutiae', 'daily', 'life', 'relationships', 'self', 'esteem', 'responsibility', 'so', 'forth', 'even', 'aesthetic', 'more', 'mopey', 'jokey', 'Think', 'Seinfeld', 'Xanax', 'much', 'more', 'pathos', 'Curb', 'Enthusiasm', 'smarm', 'Louis', 'C.K', 'modern', 'everyman', 'divorced', '40-something', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'heck', 'happened', 'confusing', 'world', 'swirls', 'more', 'intent', 'purpose', 'guts', 'ask', 'questions', 'people', 'really', 'have', 'not', 'always', 'give', 'answers', 'want', 'laughs', 'standout', 'episode', 'instance', 'ever', 'date-hungry', 'Louie', 'finally', 'coaxing', 'woman', 'out', 'then', 'convincing', 'stay', 'out', 'little', 'longer', 'donut', 'shop', 'only', 'have', 'night', 'ruined', 'group', 'dumbass', 'teenagers', 'who', 'turn', 'Louie', 'badly', 'conceived', 'effort', 'be', 'grown-up', 'room', 'exercise', 'emasculation', 'painful', 'watch', 'metaphor', 'Louie', 'life', 'flawed', 'man', 'struggling', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'When', 'date', 'gesture', 'personal', 'humiliation', 'why', 'Louie', 'nonetheless', 'loser', 'date', ""'re"", 'reminded', 'why', 'Louie', 'conscience-addled', 'square', 'peg', 'world', 'narcissistic', 'round', 'a-holes', 'Believe', 'not', 'are', 'laughs', 'there', 'how', 'episode', 'especially', 'when', 'Louie', 'one', 'teenagers', 'home', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'punk', 'parents', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'essence', 'good', 'New', 'Yorker', 'story', 'Edgy', 'overused', 'word', 'almost', 'always', 'misapplied', 'Louie', 'edgy', 'authenticity', 'more', 'listening', 'real', 'people', 'tell', 'problems', 'chuckling', 'over', 'beer', 'show', 'Gen-Xer', 'sarcasm', 'better', 'description', 'would', 'be', 'say', 'adult', 'when', 'see', 'Louie', 'struggle', 'awkward', 'first', 'date', 'suffer', 'travails', 'modern', 'air', 'travel', 'less', 'gags', 'more', 'truth', 'people', 'face', 'lives', 'Observations', 'are', 'grounded', 'reality', 'rather', 'silliness', 'more', 'funny']",N/A

Sure, he's got his ascerbic moments, and they are damn funny, but there is a ""realness"" to the season that evolves from about episode two until the season finale. I wont spoil anything for anyone, but the humorous aspects of the middle-aged, out of shape, single parent comic are flipped to reveal the darker underside of that life. That is the reality of living, the duality of living, that Louis C.K. Exposes so slowly that it definitely evokes a much different emotional response than laughter. The fact a comedy show attempts such depth is intriguing, and I am interested to see where the show takes us from here.Bottom line - there is something to appeal to everyone, and certainly something to offend everyone, but I can't imagine many who, approaching Louie with a receptive attitude, will walk away unsatisfied.

In the past, I really liked a few programs such as Cheers, Seinfeld and All In The Family, but that's about it.
