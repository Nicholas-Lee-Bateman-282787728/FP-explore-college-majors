The problem with this video is that Johnny's guitar and microphone are mixed In Your Face and you can barely hear the rest of the band. At one point Johnny takes a break to let the band strut their stuff and you can still barely hear them. It's as if whoever was doing sound wanted Johnny and only Johnny and was trying to eliminate the &#34;distraction&#34; of having other musicians on the stage. This probably doesn't make sense but I'm sad I bought a poorly made video and glad I bought this Johnny Winter concert.,3,Outstanding concert crippled by poor mixing,1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,596,"['outstanding', 'concert', 'best', 'talent', 'Blues', 'genre', 'problem', 'video', 'Johnny', 'guitar', 'microphone', 'are', 'mixed', 'Your', 'Face', 'can', 'barely', 'hear', 'rest', 'band', 'one', 'point', 'Johnny', 'break', 'let', 'band', 'strut', 'stuff', 'can', 'still', 'barely', 'hear', 'was', 'doing', 'sound', 'wanted', 'Johnny', 'only', 'Johnny', 'was', 'trying', 'eliminate', '34', 'distraction', '34', 'having', 'other', 'musicians', 'stage', 'probably', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', ""'m"", 'sad', 'bought', 'poorly', 'made', 'video', 'glad', 'bought', 'Johnny', 'Winter', 'concert']",N/A

If you like JW and realize that he's about 70 years old and a bit slower, then you will love this disc. His backing back smokes!!Don't take advantage of me has cool teases of Sunshine of Your Love and a Stones hit! Most of the tunes are from Live 97 and his recent CDs, plus several of his standards like All Over Now, Johnny B. Goode and Highway 61.I saw him in 1999 and thought he could not survive and tour another year, he looked that bad. I really have to hand it to his new management and band (and wife) who have kept him going and allowed him to thrive in the 21st century. It's minor miracle if you ask me.",5,The Grand Old Man Still SMOKES!,1343520000,"07 29, 2012",2012,672,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'video', 'playing', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'like', 'JW', 'realize', '70', 'years', 'old', 'bit', 'slower', 'then', 'will', 'love', 'disc', 'backing', 'back', 'smokes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'advantage', 'cool', 'teases', 'Sunshine', 'Your', 'Love', 'Stones', 'hit', 'Most', 'tunes', 'are', 'Live', '97', 'recent', 'CDs', 'several', 'standards', 'Over', 'Now', 'Johnny', 'B.', 'Goode', 'Highway', '61.I', 'saw', '1999', 'thought', 'could', 'not', 'survive', 'tour', 'year', 'looked', 'bad', 'really', 'have', 'hand', 'new', 'management', 'band', 'wife', 'who', 'have', 'kept', 'going', 'allowed', 'thrive', '21st', 'century', 'minor', 'miracle', 'ask']",N/A

1539712,ATLA5CJH0ZZHP,B007XIO9TU,Terry R. Nye,"[0, 0]","I have been a long-time fan of Johnny Winters.  In his prime he was an amazing blues guitar player.  After buying hisRootsalbum that was recently released and really liking it I thought I would give this concert DVD a try.  One of his other concert DVDs, Live in the 80's, was a waste of money due to its poor video and recording quality, so I was hesitant to buy this disc.The performance was recorded in April 2011.  The video quality is definitely improved over Live in the 80's, but the audio quality remains poor.  The audio is basically all from the center speaker in a 5.1 audio system, so the sound will be underwhelming to say the least.  The mixing is horrid -- most of the recorded sound emphasizes Winters' guitar and the drummer; the backup guitarist is barely audible (who is a very good guitarist, by the way, and plays licks much like Winters), and the bass is minimized.  Even Winters' singing is barely audible.  In this day and age such poor recording quality is totally unacceptable.The song selection is good, but execution of the songs is borderline in spots.  I don't know if it was intended to be homage or just losing his train of thought, but in several songs Winters would drift off into guitar riffs made famous by other guitarists like Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Keith Richards, and Stevie Ray Vaughn during some of his extended guitar solos.  It's like he ran out of ideas what to play during the song, and the riffs didn't seem to fit well.  Winters can still play some fancy guitar, but you can tell he is long past his prime.  Had the sound been mixed better I think the overall presentation, though, would have been more pleasurable.If you are a Johnny Winters fan wanting to have a record of one of his live performances you may want this DVD for your collection.  Just don't expect the sound to be up to his usual standards.  For a far better listening experience, pick up hisRootsalbum.  It is by far one of his best recordings ever.",3,poor recording of a live performance,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,1971,"['have', 'been', 'long-time', 'fan', 'Johnny', 'Winters', 'prime', 'was', 'amazing', 'blues', 'guitar', 'player', 'buying', 'hisRootsalbum', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'really', 'liking', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'concert', 'DVD', 'try', 'One', 'other', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'Live', '80', 'was', 'waste', 'money', 'due', 'poor', 'video', 'recording', 'quality', 'was', 'hesitant', 'buy', 'disc.The', 'performance', 'was', 'recorded', 'April', '2011', 'video', 'quality', 'definitely', 'improved', 'over', 'Live', '80', 'audio', 'quality', 'poor', 'audio', 'basically', 'center', 'speaker', '5.1', 'audio', 'system', 'sound', 'will', 'be', 'underwhelming', 'say', 'least', 'mixing', 'horrid', 'most', 'recorded', 'sound', 'Winters', 'guitar', 'drummer', 'backup', 'guitarist', 'barely', 'audible', 'who', 'very', 'good', 'guitarist', 'way', 'licks', 'much', 'Winters', 'bass', 'minimized', 'Even', 'Winters', 'singing', 'barely', 'audible', 'day', 'age', 'such', 'poor', 'recording', 'quality', 'totally', 'unacceptable.The', 'song', 'selection', 'good', 'execution', 'songs', 'borderline', 'spots', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'homage', 'just', 'losing', 'train', 'thought', 'several', 'songs', 'Winters', 'would', 'drift', 'off', 'guitar', 'riffs', 'made', 'famous', 'other', 'guitarists', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'Vaughn', 'extended', 'guitar', 'solos', 'ran', 'ideas', 'what', 'play', 'song', 'riffs', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'well', 'Winters', 'can', 'still', 'play', 'fancy', 'guitar', 'can', 'tell', 'long', 'prime', 'Had', 'sound', 'been', 'mixed', 'better', 'think', 'overall', 'presentation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'pleasurable.If', 'are', 'Johnny', 'Winters', 'fan', 'wanting', 'have', 'record', 'one', 'live', 'performances', 'may', 'want', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'sound', 'be', 'up', 'usual', 'standards', 'far', 'better', 'listening', 'experience', 'pick', 'up', 'hisRootsalbum', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'recordings', 'ever']",N/A
