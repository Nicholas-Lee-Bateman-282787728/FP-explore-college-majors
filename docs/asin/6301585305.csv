256333,A3STFVPM8NHJ7B,6301585305,A. Pierre,"[0, 0]","Bushwhackers VS Rogeau Brothers: Ugh, I hate the Bushwhackers and rarely ever watch a match of them. Rogeau's were a very talented team that just got lost in the shuffle in the 80's. Not a bad match, a bit enjoyable but I still hate The Bushwhackers.Genuis VS Brutus Beefcake: Beefcake is another wrestler I cannot stand watching. Genuis had a funny gimmick as they brawl to a double DQ when the ref gets knocked down and Beefcake starts to cut Genuis hair until Mr. Perfect makes the save.Ronnie Garvin VS Greg Valentine in a Submission match: Always enjoyed Valentine, im hoping WWE produces a dvd set towards him like they've been saying for years. Anyways, this was a great back and fourth match with Garvin making Valentine tapping out.Brother Love does a interview segement between Sherri and Sapphire. It just sets up there WrestleMania match.Big Bossman VS Jim Duggan: I never understood Duggan's appeal but this was one hell of a brawl. Probably the best performances from both men in there WWE career. Sadly, it ends when the ref sees Bossman use his night stick. Still a very good brawl/Rumble: Very enjoyable Rumble with many top talents of the time. Many WrestleMania matches were set because of this Rumble including Piper-Brown and Warrior-Hogan.As a side note, I'd like you to watch this Rumble for the entrances. Why? The fan favorites were cheered like crazy even the Red Rooster. Fans use to be so much more involved into wrestlers then today and the crowds use to span all ages and races. I still can't belive how loud these fans cheered for the fan favorites. Fans use to be into wrestling and now it's basically silent. I also miss the pre-interviews to the Rumble that made it seem speical rather then anther year, anther Rumble. They need to bring that back.Overall, Valentine VS Garvin and Bossman VS Duggan were two very good matches and The Rumble was great.

256334,ACAB4MFS7BBZ7,6301585305,"Christopher oliva ""King Vampiro""","[1, 1]",This Rumble was by far (In my opinion) the very best of all time. Here's 10 reasons:RUDE/HOGAN/WARRIOR/HART/SAVAGE/PIPER/ROBERTS/RHODES/PERFECT/DIBIASEDoes'nt get much better than that does it? Tony Schaivone who spent very little time in WWE calls the action with Jesse the Body my favorite commentator of all time.The undercard is where this PPV struggles. I think there is 4 matches along with a Brother Love interview w/ Sherri and Saphirre...Man was that terrible.Matches like Bossman VS Duggan and Bushwackers(WTF!) VS Rougeaus just make u wanna fast forward right through to the rumble. I own it but would'nt go higher  than 15-18$'s for this.

256335,A5DIAZ5GT3MC,6301585305,Crazy Jim,"[0, 1]","Royal Rumble has always been my favorite pay-per-view, though over the years, this classic format where thirty superstars battle it out as lost a lot of its creativety and really has not been as good as it used to be. At the time, this was the only place where you got to see the good guys fight the good guys and the bad guys fight each other too. It was every man for himself and you could always get a great show out of it.The 1990 event was one of the better &quot;Rumble&quot; matches as it featured nearly every big name WWF superstar. This was before the winner would get an automatic World Title shot so pretty much every big star was invovled. This one helped set up a lot of the feuds for Wrestlemania as in a crowd-pleasing moment, Hulk Hogan and Ultimate Warrior ended up in the ring, one on one. It was somewhat of a tease as nothing much happened but it made as great hype for their eventual match at &quot;Wrestlemania VI&quot;. There was also an incident involving Roddy Piper and Bad News Brown, a manager battle, and a few other classic moments including Ted Dibiase's &quot;Ironman&quot; performance. The list of superstars involved in this match also included &quot;Macho King&quot; Randy Savage, Andre The Giant, Ax &amp; Smash of Demolition, Bret Hart, Dusty Rhodes, Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts and many more.The undercard was somewhat poor as most of the bigger stars were in &quot;The Rumble&quot; match itself but you did get &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan taking on the Big Bossman. There was Queen Sherri and Saphire on a special edition of &quot;The Brother Love&quot; Show. And there was a tag team battle with The Bushwackers taking on the Rogeau Brothers (who still have one of the coolest theme songs ever).",4,Royal Rumble 1990 Review,1062288000,"08 31, 2003",2003,1746,"['Royal', 'Rumble', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'pay-per-view', 'years', 'classic', 'format', 'where', 'thirty', 'battle', 'out', 'lost', 'lot', 'creativety', 'really', 'not', 'been', 'as', 'good', 'used', 'be', 'time', 'was', 'only', 'place', 'where', 'got', 'see', 'good', 'guys', 'fight', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'fight', 'other', 'too', 'was', 'man', 'could', 'always', 'get', 'great', 'show', 'it.The', '1990', 'event', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'quot', 'Rumble', 'quot', 'matches', 'featured', 'nearly', 'big', 'name', 'WWF', 'superstar', 'was', 'winner', 'would', 'get', 'automatic', 'World', 'Title', 'shot', 'so', 'pretty', 'much', 'big', 'star', 'was', 'invovled', 'one', 'helped', 'set', 'up', 'lot', 'feuds', 'Wrestlemania', 'crowd-pleasing', 'moment', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'ended', 'up', 'ring', 'one', 'one', 'was', 'somewhat', 'tease', 'nothing', 'much', 'happened', 'made', 'great', 'hype', 'eventual', 'match', 'quot', 'Wrestlemania', 'VI', 'quot', 'was', 'also', 'incident', 'involving', 'Roddy', 'Piper', 'Bad', 'News', 'Brown', 'manager', 'battle', 'few', 'other', 'classic', 'moments', 'including', 'Ted', 'Dibiase', 'quot', 'Ironman', 'quot', 'performance', 'list', 'superstars', 'involved', 'match', 'also', 'included', 'quot', 'Macho', 'King', 'quot', 'Randy', 'Savage', 'Andre', 'Giant', 'Ax', 'amp', 'Smash', 'Demolition', 'Bret', 'Hart', 'Dusty', 'Rhodes', 'Jake', 'quot', 'Snake', 'quot', 'Roberts', 'many', 'more.The', 'undercard', 'was', 'somewhat', 'poor', 'most', 'bigger', 'stars', 'were', 'quot', 'Rumble', 'quot', 'match', 'did', 'get', 'quot', 'Hacksaw', 'quot', 'Jim', 'Duggan', 'taking', 'Big', 'Bossman', 'was', 'Queen', 'Sherri', 'Saphire', 'special', 'edition', 'quot', 'Brother', 'Love', 'quot', 'Show', 'was', 'tag', 'team', 'battle', 'Bushwackers', 'taking', 'Rogeau', 'Brothers', 'who', 'still', 'have', 'one', 'coolest', 'theme', 'songs', 'ever']",WWF: Royal Rumble 1990 VHS
256336,A343PEALKIN1KE,6301585305,"Mail-order Christ ""A Prince Among Maggots""","[3, 12]","This was an event riddled with inconsistencies. Everyone by now knows the results, so I don't need to worry about spoiling anything.After a 3 hour pyrotechnic sequence, and an emotional rendition of 'Billy-Jean' sung by the ghost of Roy Orbison, the event finally opened with a segment by Orlando Jordan, telling his loyal fans that if - no, WHEN he wins the rumble, he will make it his personal business to wipe out fourth-world debt. He was attacked by Howard Finkel with a plastic hairbrush, and was left bleeding.Jesse James, Rikishi Fatu, Rey Mysterio, Jerry Lawler, Mick Foley (all three personas) and Terry Funk defeated the Legion Of Doom in a 'Loser Must Die' elimination tag team match, when Rey Mysterio pinned Road Warrior Hawk for the decisive fall. As a result, Animal and Hawk were subsequently gunned down and killed by their own children.Shane McMahon defeated Stephanie McMahon in a street fight, with Vince McMahon as the special guest referee, after a diving 'hell-bow' drop from a 150 storey building in a different city.Afterwards, the two shook hands and hugged. However, Vince was so upset by Stephanie's performance, he ordered her to strip down to her underwear to everyone could point and laugh at her. Stephanie obliged, but no sooner had she done so, she revealed a secret pocket in her knickers, inside of which was a steel chair, which she used to render her father unconscious. He has been in a coma ever since.Triple H won a match he wasn't even fighting to win the World Heavyweight Title for the 7th time in 3 days. This was his 48th World title reign in total. After the match, the man he defeated for the title, Cowboy Bob Orton, said he was down-hearted by the loss, but informed his fans he would keep going, hopefully eventually marrying a member of the McMahon family so he can have the same, unjustified success that Triple H has been having. (UPDATE: With hindsight on my side, I must apologise for calling Triple H's success 'unjustified'. I feel that's somewhat too simple, as he is clearly talented and someone WWE cannot do without in their main-event scene. However, I still feel he's over-egged it somewhat in the past and his on-paper legacy is probably going to be a bit too decorated.)Shawn Michaels and Diesel defeated the referee in a 'Squeeze My Spot' match for the ABC Amateur Boxing Heavyweight Title, after a double-team Eye Rake. As a result, the referee (aptly played by Tim Robbins of 'Shawshank Redemption' fame) needed 750,000 stitches in his brain.Undertaker defeated Yokozuna in an Inferno Match. Although Yokozuna was never set on fire, Kane suddenly arrived 7 years and 9 months earlier than he was supposed to, to recite poetry in honour of Jimi Hendrix. Yokozuna fainted in a pool of tears, and the Undertaker forged his signature onto a contract that said the Undertaker could win via 'standing up'. The contract also read that Yokozuna had to dress up like a dolphin for all future matches, which was the spawning of a comedic lineage that will never be out-done.In the 300 man Royal Rumble match, which lasted over 15 hours, the first two entrants, Orlando Jordan and Howard Finkel, were the last two in the ring. They both eliminated each other simultateously, and as a result nobody won the Rumble, inevitably renderring this video completely pointless.This, we know, but words cannot do justice to this video, so just buy it.*******UPDATE: Sorry for this rubbish review. I won't delete it, as I still find it very funny in places, but it's obviously not particularly relevant. I write this two and a half years after the original piece (3rd of January 2008). In reality, there wasn't THAT much to celebrate here anyway, except the incredible mark-out moment of Hogan and Warrior facing off near the end.*******",3,Left quite a lot to be desired.,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,3785,"['was', 'event', 'riddled', 'inconsistencies', 'Everyone', 'now', 'results', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'worry', 'spoiling', 'anything.After', '3', 'hour', 'pyrotechnic', 'sequence', 'emotional', 'rendition', ""'Billy-Jean"", 'sung', 'ghost', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'event', 'finally', 'opened', 'segment', 'Orlando', 'Jordan', 'telling', 'loyal', 'fans', 'WHEN', 'rumble', 'will', 'make', 'personal', 'business', 'wipe', 'out', 'fourth-world', 'debt', 'was', 'attacked', 'Howard', 'Finkel', 'plastic', 'hairbrush', 'was', 'left', 'bleeding.Jesse', 'James', 'Rikishi', 'Fatu', 'Rey', 'Mysterio', 'Jerry', 'Lawler', 'Mick', 'Foley', 'three', 'personas', 'Terry', 'Funk', 'defeated', 'Legion', 'Doom', ""'Loser"", 'Must', 'Die', 'elimination', 'tag', 'team', 'match', 'when', 'Rey', 'Mysterio', 'pinned', 'Road', 'Warrior', 'Hawk', 'decisive', 'fall', 'result', 'Animal', 'Hawk', 'were', 'subsequently', 'gunned', 'down', 'killed', 'own', 'children.Shane', 'McMahon', 'defeated', 'Stephanie', 'McMahon', 'street', 'fight', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'special', 'guest', 'referee', 'diving', ""'hell-bow"", 'drop', '150', 'storey', 'building', 'different', 'city.Afterwards', 'two', 'shook', 'hands', 'hugged', 'However', 'Vince', 'was', 'so', 'upset', 'Stephanie', 'performance', 'ordered', 'strip', 'down', 'underwear', 'everyone', 'could', 'point', 'laugh', 'Stephanie', 'obliged', 'sooner', 'had', 'done', 'so', 'revealed', 'secret', 'pocket', 'knickers', 'was', 'steel', 'chair', 'used', 'render', 'father', 'unconscious', 'been', 'coma', 'ever', 'since.Triple', 'H', 'won', 'match', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'fighting', 'win', 'World', 'Heavyweight', 'Title', '7th', 'time', '3', 'days', 'was', '48th', 'World', 'title', 'reign', 'total', 'match', 'man', 'defeated', 'title', 'Cowboy', 'Bob', 'Orton', 'said', 'was', 'down-hearted', 'loss', 'informed', 'fans', 'would', 'keep', 'going', 'hopefully', 'eventually', 'marrying', 'member', 'McMahon', 'family', 'so', 'can', 'have', 'same', 'unjustified', 'success', 'Triple', 'H', 'been', 'having', 'UPDATE', 'hindsight', 'side', 'must', 'apologise', 'calling', 'Triple', 'H', 'success', ""'unjustified"", 'feel', 'somewhat', 'too', 'simple', 'clearly', 'talented', 'someone', 'WWE', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'main-event', 'scene', 'However', 'still', 'feel', 'over-egged', 'somewhat', 'past', 'on-paper', 'legacy', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'decorated', 'Shawn', 'Michaels', 'Diesel', 'defeated', 'referee', ""'Squeeze"", 'My', 'Spot', 'match', 'ABC', 'Amateur', 'Boxing', 'Heavyweight', 'Title', 'double-team', 'Eye', 'Rake', 'result', 'referee', 'aptly', 'played', 'Tim', 'Robbins', ""'Shawshank"", 'Redemption', 'fame', 'needed', '750,000', 'stitches', 'brain.Undertaker', 'defeated', 'Yokozuna', 'Inferno', 'Match', 'Yokozuna', 'was', 'never', 'set', 'fire', 'Kane', 'suddenly', 'arrived', '7', 'years', '9', 'months', 'earlier', 'was', 'supposed', 'recite', 'poetry', 'honour', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Yokozuna', 'fainted', 'pool', 'tears', 'Undertaker', 'forged', 'signature', 'contract', 'said', 'Undertaker', 'could', 'win', ""'standing"", 'up', 'contract', 'also', 'read', 'Yokozuna', 'had', 'dress', 'up', 'dolphin', 'future', 'matches', 'was', 'spawning', 'comedic', 'lineage', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'out-done.In', '300', 'man', 'Royal', 'Rumble', 'match', 'lasted', '15', 'hours', 'first', 'two', 'entrants', 'Orlando', 'Jordan', 'Howard', 'Finkel', 'were', 'last', 'two', 'ring', 'eliminated', 'other', 'simultateously', 'result', 'nobody', 'won', 'Rumble', 'inevitably', 'renderring', 'video', 'completely', 'pointless.This', 'know', 'words', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'video', 'so', 'just', 'buy', '*******UPDATE', 'Sorry', 'rubbish', 'review', 'wo', ""n't"", 'delete', 'still', 'find', 'very', 'funny', 'places', 'obviously', 'not', 'particularly', 'relevant', 'write', 'two', 'half', 'years', 'original', 'piece', '3rd', 'January', '2008', 'reality', 'was', ""n't"", 'THAT', 'much', 'celebrate', 'here', 'anyway', 'incredible', 'mark-out', 'moment', 'Hogan', 'Warrior', 'facing', 'off', 'end', '*******']",WWF: Royal Rumble 1990 VHS
