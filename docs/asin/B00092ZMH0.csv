It was the cut up, syndicated episodes with no special features, but not this time.  I am surprised Amazon doesn't mention it, but there are several commentaries on episodes from the second season.  Nancy Dussault and Jim J. Bullock team up to do several commentaries as do Lydia Cornell and Deborah Van Valkenburgh.  If you are a fan of the show and was a little put out about the first season as I was, I think you will like season two a lot better.",5,Much Better!,1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,552,"['Well', 'think', 'everyone', 'was', 'little', 'upset', 'Rhino', 'first', 'season', 'release', 'Too', 'Close', 'Comfort', 'was', 'cut', 'up', 'syndicated', 'episodes', 'special', 'features', 'not', 'time', 'am', 'surprised', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'mention', 'are', 'several', 'commentaries', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'Nancy', 'Dussault', 'Jim', 'J.', 'Bullock', 'team', 'up', 'do', 'several', 'commentaries', 'do', 'Lydia', 'Cornell', 'Deborah', 'Van', 'Valkenburgh', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'was', 'little', 'put', 'out', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'think', 'will', 'like', 'season', 'two', 'lot', 'better']",Too Close for Comfort - Complete Second Season

The only thing the show haunted me with was it's opening theme song, sounding like something the band ""Steely Dan"" would've done.

900763,A20U54S8PC1291,B00092ZMH0,J. McDonald,"[10, 11]","Too close for comfort is a very enjoyable sitcom that overflows with 80's charm and innocence! The first two seasons had a few duds and the series did have some severe growing pains before it reached its stride, but the ride is worth taking! Once the actors settle into their roles and the writers begin to ""get with it"" the series finally begins to shine as brightly as the first episode from season 1 had promised!The characters (and actors) are all very likable and the series is a great flashback to 80's simplicity, optimism and just plain FUN. The characters are all people you'd like to know (well, maybe not monroe, hehe) and that's part of the charm for this series.Rhino got it right with this release, the episodes are uncut and there are many extras (a few commentaries and a short ""cast reunion"" segment). Let's hope they hurry up with the release of the THIRD season, and who knows what will become of the ""Ted knight Show"" episodes which were all renamed as ""too close for comfort"" when repackaged for syndication?The only sad thing about watching a series like this is that you know that it has to end, and like so many other great t.v. series the ending came much too soon for Too Close for Comfort! It's Actually a shame they eventually reworked the series into the Ted Knight Show for the final year, it would have been really nice to have had another season that followed the original premise that made all of the fans love the show!I've watched them all and I'm ready to buy some more, so come on Rhino and start up the DVD press again!-JM",5,A great trip back to the 80's!,1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,1560,"['Too', 'close', 'comfort', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'sitcom', '80', 'charm', 'innocence', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'had', 'few', 'duds', 'series', 'did', 'have', 'severe', 'growing', 'pains', 'reached', 'stride', 'ride', 'worth', 'taking', 'Once', 'actors', 'settle', 'roles', 'writers', 'begin', 'get', 'series', 'finally', 'shine', 'as', 'brightly', 'first', 'episode', 'season', '1', 'had', 'promised', 'characters', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'likable', 'series', 'great', 'flashback', '80', 'simplicity', 'optimism', 'just', 'plain', 'FUN', 'characters', 'are', 'people', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'well', 'maybe', 'not', 'monroe', 'hehe', 'part', 'charm', 'series.Rhino', 'got', 'right', 'release', 'episodes', 'are', 'uncut', 'are', 'many', 'extras', 'few', 'commentaries', 'short', 'cast', 'reunion', 'segment', 'Let', 'hope', 'hurry', 'up', 'release', 'THIRD', 'season', 'who', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'Ted', 'knight', 'Show', 'episodes', 'were', 'renamed', 'too', 'close', 'comfort', 'when', 'repackaged', 'syndication', 'only', 'sad', 'thing', 'watching', 'series', 'know', 'end', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'great', 't.v', 'series', 'ending', 'came', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'Too', 'Close', 'Comfort', 'Actually', 'shame', 'eventually', 'reworked', 'series', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'Show', 'final', 'year', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'nice', 'have', 'had', 'season', 'followed', 'original', 'premise', 'made', 'fans', 'love', 'show', ""'ve"", 'watched', ""'m"", 'ready', 'buy', 'more', 'so', 'come', 'Rhino', 'start', 'up', 'DVD', 'press', 'again', '-JM']",Too Close for Comfort - Complete Second Season

The packaging was excellent and I especially enjoyed the Cosmic Cow icon that pops up on the episode selection list. It was also nice to be able to immediately skip the show's opening(after a few episodes it gets redundant) and go straight to scene selection!Eventhough Too Close for Comfort was not one of the funniest sitcoms of the 80's, I bought it because I had'nt seen it in years and I actually enjoyed seeing Ted Knight playing the funny overprotective Dad. My only complaint is I wish Rhino would re-release season one with unedited episodes and I'm thankful for the reviewers on Amazon who let people know about the syndicated version before deciding to purchase it!",5,RHINO GOT IT RIGHT THIS TIME!!!!!,1121644800,"07 18, 2005",2005,763,"['Needless', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'Rhino', 'released', 'season', '2', 'original', 'format', 'packaging', 'was', 'excellent', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'Cosmic', 'Cow', 'icon', 'up', 'episode', 'selection', 'list', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'be', 'able', 'immediately', 'skip', 'show', 'opening', 'few', 'episodes', 'redundant', 'go', 'straight', 'scene', 'selection', 'Eventhough', 'Too', 'Close', 'Comfort', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'funniest', 'sitcoms', '80', 'bought', ""had'nt"", 'seen', 'years', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'playing', 'funny', 'overprotective', 'Dad', 'only', 'complaint', 'wish', 'Rhino', 'would', 're-release', 'season', 'one', 'unedited', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'thankful', 'reviewers', 'Amazon', 'who', 'let', 'people', 'know', 'syndicated', 'version', 'deciding', 'purchase']",Too Close for Comfort - Complete Second Season
