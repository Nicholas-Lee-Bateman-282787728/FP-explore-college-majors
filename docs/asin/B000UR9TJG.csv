1096199,A4DBFOB6ALKJY,B000UR9TJG,Huh? Wha?,"[0, 0]","Jim Norton is fantastic, if it's your style. I really enjoy being able to step back, not be offended at the off-the-wall comedy style he brings to the table.  I've always liked his material -- from Opie and Anthony, to Lucky Louie, to his stand up spots on various late night shows and Comedy Central.However, here's my warning to the parents -- do NOT watch this with young children. Jim Norton is incredibly vulgar and touches on subjects best left until they're old enough to know right from wrong, and words to not say. Trust me -- you do NOT want your kids repeating his stuff around town.That said -- he touches on subjects that people just don't normally talk about. His comedy goes from sexual, to social issues, to politics. He's not afraid to offend every single group out there, and make you laugh while he does it. If you can take his comments as comedy and leave your sensibilities home for a bit and not take yourself and everything around you seriously, he's going to make you roll around in your chair in hysterics. Otherwise, you'd do better with a lighter comic.",5,Jim Norton strikes again!,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,1080,"['Jim', 'Norton', 'fantastic', 'style', 'really', 'enjoy', 'being', 'able', 'step', 'back', 'not', 'be', 'offended', 'off-the-wall', 'comedy', 'style', 'table', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'material', 'Opie', 'Anthony', 'Lucky', 'Louie', 'stand', 'up', 'spots', 'various', 'late', 'night', 'shows', 'Comedy', 'Central.However', 'here', 'warning', 'parents', 'do', 'NOT', 'watch', 'young', 'children', 'Jim', 'Norton', 'incredibly', 'vulgar', 'touches', 'subjects', 'best', 'left', ""'re"", 'old', 'enough', 'know', 'right', 'wrong', 'words', 'not', 'say', 'Trust', 'do', 'NOT', 'want', 'kids', 'repeating', 'stuff', 'town.That', 'said', 'subjects', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'talk', 'comedy', 'sexual', 'social', 'issues', 'politics', 'not', 'afraid', 'offend', 'single', 'group', 'there', 'make', 'can', 'take', 'comments', 'comedy', 'leave', 'sensibilities', 'home', 'bit', 'not', 'take', 'everything', 'seriously', 'going', 'make', 'roll', 'around', 'chair', 'hysterics', 'Otherwise', ""'d"", 'do', 'better', 'lighter', 'comic']",Jim Norton: Monster Rain
1096200,A2ZX6GW8WL5AG3,B000UR9TJG,jimmy_rants@yahoo,"[1, 3]","I was at the 2nd show of Lil Jimmy's at the Lincoln Theater. I've seen our boy before in Virginia and I love the hell out of his style. I liked the live show so much better than seeing him on tape however.I'm glad Norton has a girlfriend now and is happy- I think he's funnier though when he can relate to  us as a horny loser instead of an established STABLE NY/LA semi-star. He's great on the radio with his little asides and inappropriate inferences and I loved him on ""Tough Crowd"". I truly see his future as a panelist or columnist. Could you imagine Norton on a format ""Match Game"" or ""Hollywood Squares""??I'm not saying Jim's not strong enough to carry a show by himself. I loved his material on Ann Coulter,John Edwards,Imus..I will never look at a Basset Hound again without imagining a miners hat on it. I think he is the perfect third man on the team and he should avoid overexposure.Sadly, the ""extras"" on the video are limited to two scenes cut from the show. There are no behind the scenes, no outside crowd scenes with the signings with Opie and Anthony(which was very lively).(BTW Jimmy, still love you man, but the Lincoln Theater is not a ""bad"" neighborhood, it's a pussified, yupped-out urban area with typical coffee houses and galleries...)",4,Great Show LIVE,1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,1261,"['was', '2nd', 'show', 'Lil', 'Jimmy', 'Lincoln', 'Theater', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'boy', 'Virginia', 'love', 'hell', 'style', 'liked', 'live', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'seeing', 'tape', 'however.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Norton', 'girlfriend', 'now', 'happy-', 'think', 'funnier', 'when', 'can', 'relate', 'horny', 'loser', 'instead', 'established', 'STABLE', 'NY/LA', 'semi-star', 'great', 'radio', 'little', 'asides', 'inappropriate', 'inferences', 'loved', 'Tough', 'Crowd', 'truly', 'see', 'future', 'panelist', 'columnist', 'Could', 'imagine', 'Norton', 'format', 'Match', 'Game', 'Hollywood', 'Squares', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Jim', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'carry', 'show', 'loved', 'material', 'Ann', 'Coulter', 'John', 'Edwards', 'Imus..I', 'will', 'never', 'look', 'Basset', 'Hound', 'again', 'imagining', 'miners', 'think', 'perfect', 'third', 'man', 'team', 'should', 'avoid', 'overexposure.Sadly', 'extras', 'video', 'are', 'limited', 'two', 'scenes', 'cut', 'show', 'are', 'scenes', 'outside', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'signings', 'Opie', 'Anthony', 'was', 'very', 'lively', 'BTW', 'Jimmy', 'still', 'love', 'man', 'Lincoln', 'Theater', 'not', 'bad', 'neighborhood', 'pussified', 'yupped-out', 'urban', 'area', 'typical', 'coffee', 'houses', 'galleries']",Jim Norton: Monster Rain

At least I just hope I never run into any of is former girlfriends.  He won't date a woman unless she will perform ""analingus"" on him, and spends half hs act talking about this very thing.  It seems he'd rather do that than have normal sex with a woman.  And if this doesn't make you want to throw up maybe his story of how he gave oral sex to his best buddy in 2nd grade...multiple times under the front proch.  Norton says he likes women but too mch of his act has a homosexual slant to it.  The rest of his act is basically low-brow humor-- cussing in place of creative humor, like something a little kid would put together.
