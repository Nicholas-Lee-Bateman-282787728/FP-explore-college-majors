This season had a couple episodes I wasn't so familiar with so I definable enjoyed that. At least one episode had poor video quality, presumably for the same reason as previous seasons. Audio was decent though and didn't prevent enjoyment.",5,must have for lovers of the show,1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,337,"['ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '5', 'have', 'other', 'seasons', 'have', 'complete', 'collection', 'season', 'had', 'couple', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'familiar', 'so', 'definable', 'enjoyed', 'least', 'one', 'episode', 'had', 'poor', 'video', 'quality', 'presumably', 'same', 'reason', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Audio', 'was', 'decent', 'did', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'enjoyment']",Hey Dude: Season 4
1640727,ATGCMWMC0JJIQ,B00BXPMJL4,classic tv fan,"[1, 1]","Season 4 of Hey Dude on DVD is here. The set up is the same as previous releases. However due to lower sales, Shout is only selling this through their website or from an authorized seller on here (which is where I got mine). I actually had mine about a week and half before the official release date. I suggest buying it here because shipping is cheaper than through Shout's site. Either way pick it up so the message is heard to release the fifth and final season.",5,Another great season,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,465,"['Season', '4', 'Hey', 'Dude', 'DVD', 'here', 'set', 'up', 'same', 'previous', 'releases', 'However', 'due', 'lower', 'sales', 'Shout', 'only', 'selling', 'website', 'authorized', 'seller', 'here', 'where', 'got', 'mine', 'actually', 'had', 'mine', 'week', 'half', 'official', 'release', 'date', 'suggest', 'buying', 'here', 'shipping', 'cheaper', 'Shout', 'site', 'way', 'pick', 'up', 'so', 'message', 'heard', 'release', 'fifth', 'final', 'season']",Hey Dude: Season 4

The Cowboys and Cowgirls they ride horses and they like the riding but they like some but it was from Bubble Guppies and Barney. Some are really good sometimes.  That was from the Cowgirl Parade and from Howdy friends.,5,cool,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,271,"['like', 'very', 'much', 'like', 'nickelodeon', 'shows', 'Cowboys', 'Cowgirls', 'ride', 'horses', 'like', 'riding', 'like', 'was', 'Bubble', 'Guppies', 'Barney', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'sometimes', 'was', 'Cowgirl', 'Parade', 'Howdy', 'friends']",Hey Dude: Season 4
