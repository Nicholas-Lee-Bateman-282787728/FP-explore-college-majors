961774,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000CRR3NI,Byron Kolln,"[0, 0]","Although writers committed the ""cardinal television sin"" of having their two main characters consummate their long-held sexual tension, the third season of MOONLIGHTING features many of the show's best-ever episodes (""Atomic Shakespeare"", ""Big Man on Mulberry Street"", ""The Straight Poop"" and ""I Am Curious...Maddie"").This was in my opinion the very height of MOONLIGHTING magic.  Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd really knew their characters by this point, and their scenes together crackle with romantic tension and zinzy comedy.  Allyce Beasley's role of kooky receptionist Miss DiPesto was expanded; and the introduction of Curtis Armstrong as Herb gave the character of DiPesto her very own love interest.COMPLETE EPISODE LISTING:""The Son Also Rises"" - Paul Sorvino guest stars as David's estranged father, who plans on remarrying.

Hustwick,"[3, 4]","Now I remember why I stopped watching this show around the end of 1987.Moonlighting imploded in its third season, as the writers decided to focus on the increasingly labored ""banter"" between David And Maddie...with vastly diminishing returns.  Cybil Shepard and Bruce Willis actually seemed to be getting on each other's nerves a lot, and no amount of quick cuts and rehashes of the same snob vs. slob arguments could rekindle the magic.Worse still, the show spent almost all of its time on this tired formula while abandoning the entire premise of the show -- that they are a detective agency!  Once the show started breaking the fourth wall every other episode (it was clever the first time), they apparently decided to also abandon all semblance of believability and motivation for the characters.  David comes across as an incompetent, egotistical, obnoxious jerk while Maddie just becomes shrewish. HOW could she not fire this guy?  I thought the entire premise was that they were odd couple who dealt with some of life's issues through all of the grey areas they encountered on their little mystery adventures! You lose that and you lose the whole show.  Remington Steele suffered a similar fate.The truth of the matter is that during the second season Moonlighting ran a lot of its story threads out (there was even an entire Miss Depesto episode), and it ended with a huge breaking of the fourth wall as the actors walked off the soundstage and had an awkward farewell.  I would suggest you take that as the end of the series and leave on a high note.",2,"From a ""detective agency"" to couples counseling....",1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,1559,"['Now', 'remember', 'why', 'stopped', 'watching', 'show', 'end', '1987.Moonlighting', 'imploded', 'third', 'season', 'writers', 'decided', 'focus', 'increasingly', 'labored', 'banter', 'David', 'Maddie', 'vastly', 'diminishing', 'returns', 'Cybil', 'Shepard', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'actually', 'seemed', 'be', 'getting', 'other', 'nerves', 'lot', 'amount', 'quick', 'cuts', 'rehashes', 'same', 'snob', 'vs.', 'slob', 'arguments', 'could', 'rekindle', 'magic.Worse', 'still', 'show', 'spent', 'almost', 'time', 'tired', 'formula', 'abandoning', 'entire', 'premise', 'show', 'are', 'detective', 'agency', 'show', 'started', 'breaking', 'fourth', 'wall', 'other', 'episode', 'was', 'clever', 'first', 'time', 'apparently', 'decided', 'also', 'abandon', 'semblance', 'believability', 'motivation', 'characters', 'David', 'across', 'incompetent', 'egotistical', 'obnoxious', 'jerk', 'Maddie', 'just', 'becomes', 'shrewish', 'HOW', 'could', 'not', 'fire', 'guy', 'thought', 'entire', 'premise', 'was', 'were', 'odd', 'couple', 'who', 'life', 'issues', 'grey', 'areas', 'encountered', 'little', 'mystery', 'lose', 'lose', 'whole', 'show', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'suffered', 'similar', 'fate.The', 'truth', 'matter', 'second', 'season', 'Moonlighting', 'ran', 'lot', 'story', 'threads', 'out', 'was', 'even', 'entire', 'Miss', 'Depesto', 'episode', 'ended', 'huge', 'breaking', 'fourth', 'wall', 'actors', 'walked', 'off', 'soundstage', 'had', 'awkward', 'farewell', 'would', 'suggest', 'take', 'end', 'series', 'leave', 'high', 'note']",Moonlighting - Season 3

961781,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000CRR3NI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 9]","Actually, I was really surprised that Season 3 of ""Moonlighting"" was as good as it was.  But then all of the stuff at the beginning of episodes talking about viewers waiting around for new episodes was a painful reminder of what it was like during the 1986-87 season where it seemed like every repeat was a step or two backwards for the series.  A full season is supposed to be 22 episodes, and ""Moonlighting"" could only come up with 15, and since one of those was a clip show (""The Straight Poop"") and the one after that the misadventures of Agnes Dipesto and Herbert Viola (""Poltergeist III--- Dipesto Nothing:""), you can knock that number down to an unlike 13.  Again I find myself wishing that at least with regards to ""Moonlighting"" that the show had been a British import, since they are perfectly content to do a full season (""series"" in their brand of English) that could be a dozen episodes or less.So, even though on the one hand we have those back-to-back episodes treading water while Glen Gordon Caron tried to keep the show afloat, right before that point we had a three episode run of ""Big Man on Mulberry Street,"" ""Atomic Shakespeare,"" and ""It's a Wonderful Job,"" which qualifies as constituting as good as it gets with Dave (Bruce Willis) and Maddie (Cybil Shepherd).  ""Moonlighting"" was nominated for fourteen Emmy Awards that season, and unllike the previous year when it was shut out won for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (Willis), and picked up awards for Hairstyling, Costume, and Editing for a Single Camera Production, all for ""Atomic Shakespeare"" (which was the most expensive and lowest rated episode for the show).  The iambic pentameter show had another five nominations, but ""Big Man on Mulberry Street"" was up for one (choreography) and ""I am Curious...Maddie"" had two as well (directing and writing).  ""Atomic Shakespeare"" got a lot of the press, but the standout episode is clearly ""Big Man on Mulberry Street,"" which not only has the great dance number to Billy Joel's music, directed by the great Stanley Donner, but the great scene when Dave finds Maddie in his hotel room and she explains why she is there but will not look at him).  The freeze frame at the end ain't bad either, hombres.Being able to watch these fifteen episodes straight through makes a difference, even when we get to the Sam the Astronaut episodes at the end.  The fact that ""Moonlighting"" was a dramedy is driven home by ""Blonde on Blonde,"" where we have the comedy of Dave following the wrong woman thinking it is Maddie and he is protecting her from having sex with a stranger, and the sobering moment where he goes to her house in the middle of the night to confess that he is in ""like"" with her and Sam  answers the door.  The casting of Mark Harmon as the other man is prefect, because we can both hate him for entering the picture and still admit he would be better for Maddie.  Besides, her anger over the fact he will not say anything legitimately builds the tension to the point where she hauls off and hits him twice, but not three times (cue: ""Be My Baby"").  It might be all down hill from here, and ""To Heiress Humor"" certainly has too much slapstick for my taste, but the moment of absolute wish fulfillment still hits home.The other surprise is that some of the cases that Blue Moon Investigations handles during Season Three are pretty interesting.  There is the dead wife who calls her husband (""The Man Who Cried Wife""), the woman who wanted to end the exchange of torrid love letters (""Yours, Very Deadly""), and the priest who becomes infatuated with a woman he has heard in confession (""All Creatures Great and ... Not So Great"").  Plus you can throw in Dave's father's wedding (""The Son Also Rises"").  There are really only those two throw away episodes (the clips are great, but we have all of these episodes on DVD, right?), and only ""Symphony in Knocked Flat"" really goes over the top, so even if the season finale is the beginning of the end, we are still into double figures for great and above average episodes.  Now take into account that there are only 15 of them to begin with and that number looks pretty impressive.The DVD extras include a ""Memories of Moonlighting"" featurette where Caron, Willis and Shepherd sit down and reminisce (the writer does most of the talking, surprise, surprise), and a commentary track for ""The Straight Poop"" where they brought in a quartet of women who had labored on the Internet to have ""Moonlighting"" come out on DVD.  This was a real treat and when more of these cult classic television series come out on DVD other producers should considering doing the same.  After all, the people who buy television shows that are two decades long are clear die hard (rim shot) fans, and ordinary people who can name an episode two seconds into a clip look pretty good

Because of how the creator and the stars fought and how the show ended.  It's like mourning all over again.  You end up wallowing in the show and then trying to figure out how everything fell apart so badly.  I think this show would have been better on a schedule such as HBO uses for its shows now.  Expecting 23 episodes of Moonlighting was not realistic and the creative juices could have flowed more smoothly and sustained the show.That being said, there is no question that the Moonlighting season 3 was some of the greatest television ever made.  Maddie Hayes and David Addison are two characters who continue to deserve attention and admiration almost twenty years after their demise.Maddie is a beautiful woman who has made a fortune based on looks and now has to rely on her brains for the first time.  David is an immature coworker trying to grow up and impress his boss.  Both characters may fail in the end, but the struggle is ever so interesting.I highly recommend this show for anyone who loves quality television.One reviewer complains about flaws on two of the disks, I found them too, but all I had to do was open up the DVD, send the disk back in, select the scene again and there wasn't a problem.

961787,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B000CRR3NI,Nicholas Carroll,"[29, 31]","""Moonlighting"" is my all time favorite television show and I'm very happy that it's finally being released on DVD. The legal issues involved in rights to all the songs Bruce Willis sings made it a long, arduous journey to DVD, but well worth the wait. The show has an interesting trajectory...as it began as a mid-season replacement, so season 1 was a half season. It ran for 5 seasons, with season 3 being the best one. Once David and Maddie slept together, it went downhill as the personal conflicts between Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd got more intense.This season has ""Atomic Shakespeare"", which was one of the coolest episodes I ever saw any tv show attempt. Shakespeare is generally not a joy to read in high school English class (the appreciation and enjoyment of Shakespeare's works seems to come later in life)...but this show made Shakespeare cool for me as one episode used ""The Taming of the Shrew"" and Elizabethan costumes. The ending is classic as both David and Maddie yell into the camera: ""I hate iambic pentameter!"" Or something like that (my memory will be refreshed as soon as I get this collection into my hands and relive it all).With this release, I hope seasons 4 and 5 are not too far behind in being released. Although the show slopes in its final two seasons, I still think as a whole, the 5 years it aired remains leaps and bounds over any other tv show I've ever seen. The antics of David Addison, with his cool boss demeanor and penchant for breaking into song (something I was happy to see Bruce Willis bring to the big screen in his otherwise dismal ""Hudson Hawk"" film in 1991), matched with Maddie Hayes all-too-serious business lady made for some captivating television. This is one of few shows in which I plan to own every season on DVD (""The West Wing"" being the other). Even when it was bad, it was good. David Addison might even agree.",5,The one I've been waiting for!,1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,1878,"['Moonlighting', 'time', 'favorite', 'television', 'show', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'finally', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'legal', 'issues', 'involved', 'rights', 'songs', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'sings', 'made', 'long', 'arduous', 'journey', 'DVD', 'well', 'wait', 'show', 'interesting', 'trajectory', 'began', 'mid-season', 'replacement', 'season', '1', 'was', 'half', 'season', 'ran', '5', 'seasons', 'season', '3', 'being', 'best', 'one', 'Once', 'David', 'Maddie', 'slept', 'together', 'went', 'downhill', 'personal', 'conflicts', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'got', 'more', 'intense.This', 'season', 'Atomic', 'Shakespeare', 'was', 'one', 'coolest', 'episodes', 'ever', 'saw', 'tv', 'show', 'attempt', 'Shakespeare', 'generally', 'not', 'joy', 'read', 'high', 'school', 'English', 'class', 'appreciation', 'enjoyment', 'Shakespeare', 'works', 'come', 'later', 'life', 'show', 'made', 'Shakespeare', 'cool', 'one', 'episode', 'used', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'Elizabethan', 'costumes', 'ending', 'classic', 'David', 'Maddie', 'yell', 'camera', 'hate', 'iambic', 'pentameter', 'something', 'memory', 'will', 'be', 'refreshed', 'as', 'soon', 'get', 'collection', 'hands', 'relive', '.With', 'release', 'hope', 'seasons', '4', '5', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'being', 'released', 'show', 'final', 'two', 'seasons', 'still', 'think', 'whole', '5', 'years', 'aired', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'other', 'tv', 'show', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'antics', 'David', 'Addison', 'cool', 'boss', 'demeanor', 'penchant', 'breaking', 'song', 'something', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'bring', 'big', 'screen', 'otherwise', 'dismal', 'Hudson', 'Hawk', 'film', '1991', 'matched', 'Maddie', 'Hayes', 'all-too-serious', 'business', 'lady', 'made', 'captivating', 'television', 'one', 'few', 'shows', 'plan', 'own', 'season', 'DVD', 'West', 'Wing', 'being', 'other', 'Even', 'when', 'was', 'bad', 'was', 'good', 'David', 'Addison', 'might', 'even', 'agree']",Moonlighting - Season 3

961789,A261PFFOK6LLGZ,B000CRR3NI,Petter Sellers,"[0, 0]","This is truly a long-awaited season since among fans it is often rated as the best of the best of the series. Season three is very fresh and evolving and holds pretty well next to Season Two that was a very hard act to follow.  In this season we get classic episodes like ""Atomic Shakespeare"", ""Big Man on Mulberry Street"" as well as the  hilarious ""Symphony in Knocked Flat"".Imagine that the first time that Moonlighting aired in Greece; many episodes were not presented in the original order.  For example the episode ""Symphony in Knocked Flat"" was picked as the opener for Season Three for obvious reasons.  Even though on later reruns, other TV channels did justice on the order of the episodes.  I mean no matter how good may be an episode you just do not shift its order from three to one.  This DVD package will be a real pleasure for all collector's who wish to have the proper air date order of that television show.More over, this is the season that includes the five episode story that starts from ""Blonde on Blonde"" and leads to the season finale ""To Heiress Human"".That was really the time that Moonlighting reached its peak as far as ratings are concerned.  Still, I believe that the American viewers must felt the ABC channel spoiled all the effect of surprise in respect to the episode that led to the consummation of the duo.  Reading about the whole thing in sites dedicated to the series, ABC Channel tried to capitalize commercially on the anticipation of the fans (by attracting sponsors) and further plugging the premiere of a long forgotten ""Max Headroom"". That must have been sad for all the fans in America because the viewers in Greece enjoyed the natural course and the surprise event between the two main characters.  That had to do with the fact that the series was on public television with no commercial interruptions so no destructive to the surprise element marketing ingeniuty took place.Personally, as I remember being on a trip in Spain right after the two first Moonlighting seasons had ended in Greece, I had seen on CNN a recurring news event concerning the profanity and the love scene between Maddie and David.  I will never forget that the CNN commentary was hammering the show and for the explicit dialogue and scenes.  By viewing that CNN news commentary I got the impression that Moonlighting had done something really extravagant and pushed the envelope really far.  Flashing forward a year later when the ""I am Curious...Maddie"" first aired in Greece no thunder from the censors came by, only the genuine surprise among the viewers that Maddie and David got finally in bed together.  It was television magic.All these memories are now offered in this package through classic and ground-breaking episodes. I hope that no alterations took place for Season Three from Lions Gate.  Still, I hope for a special package that will include all five seasons, no episode alterations, all the 15 - 30 second teasers, hopefully the ABC special TV ads for the show, all the deleted scenes and out-takes.

Remington Steele brought a fine blend of mystery and comedy to TV.  The other show was Moonlighting also a fine blend of mystery and comedy.The major problem with Moonlighting is the Lion's Gate Entertainment release.  Cheap packaging and little thought to menu selection made the season 1&2 release barely worth the cost.  Only the excellent pilot and follow-on shows made it worth the purchase.Now we have the season 3 release with the same problems.  Topping off the cheapness of the packaging, I had forgotten that season 3 was full of short story lines that required ""fillers"" and story lines that didn't even try to include the mystery aspect.  It's no wonder that I didn't bother watching the follow-on seasons and won't be buying the DVDs for seasons 4 and 5.Unless you like iambic pentameter and a few poorly plotted mysteries save your money for season 3 of Remington Steele.",2,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap!",1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,955,"['were', 'two', 'shows', 'early/mid', '1980', 'wanted', 'DVD', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'brought', 'fine', 'blend', 'mystery', 'comedy', 'TV', 'other', 'show', 'was', 'Moonlighting', 'also', 'fine', 'blend', 'mystery', 'comedy.The', 'major', 'problem', 'Moonlighting', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'Entertainment', 'release', 'Cheap', 'packaging', 'little', 'thought', 'menu', 'selection', 'made', 'season', '1', '2', 'release', 'barely', 'cost', 'Only', 'excellent', 'pilot', 'follow-on', 'shows', 'made', 'purchase.Now', 'have', 'season', '3', 'release', 'same', 'problems', 'Topping', 'off', 'cheapness', 'packaging', 'had', 'forgotten', 'season', '3', 'was', 'full', 'short', 'story', 'lines', 'required', 'fillers', 'story', 'lines', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'include', 'mystery', 'aspect', 'wonder', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watching', 'follow-on', 'seasons', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'buying', 'DVDs', 'seasons', '4', '5.Unless', 'iambic', 'pentameter', 'few', 'poorly', 'plotted', 'mysteries', 'save', 'money', 'season', '3', 'Remington', 'Steele']",Moonlighting - Season 3
961791,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B000CRR3NI,P Magnum,"[4, 4]",Season Three of Moonlighting was the zenith of the show's five season run.  The sexual tension between Maddy Hayes (Cybil Shepherd) & David Addison (Bruce Willis) reaches its peak and is resolved.  The season contains the series' most infamous episode in which a boys dreams about the cast starring in a version of Shakespeare's Taming Of The Shrew.  There is also an episode that is an homage to It's A Wonderful Life where Maddy sees what the her life and the lives of the employees of the Blue Moon Agency would have been like if she did sell the business like she had intended.  Mr. Willis is the real star of this season.  He explodes off the screen and it is easy to see how he made the transition to the big screen.  He won a well-deserved Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama series for his work in this season.,5,Hallmark Season,1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,825,"['Season', 'Three', 'Moonlighting', 'was', 'zenith', 'show', 'five', 'season', 'run', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Maddy', 'Hayes', 'Cybil', 'Shepherd', 'David', 'Addison', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'peak', 'resolved', 'season', 'series', 'most', 'infamous', 'episode', 'boys', 'cast', 'starring', 'version', 'Shakespeare', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'also', 'episode', 'homage', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'where', 'Maddy', 'what', 'life', 'lives', 'employees', 'Blue', 'Moon', 'Agency', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'did', 'sell', 'business', 'had', 'intended', 'Mr.', 'Willis', 'real', 'star', 'season', 'screen', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'made', 'transition', 'big', 'screen', 'won', 'well-deserved', 'Emmy', 'Outstanding', 'Lead', 'Actor', 'Drama', 'series', 'work', 'season']",Moonlighting - Season 3
