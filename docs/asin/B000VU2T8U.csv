Michelle is fluid and graceful, and can actually keep her planes even (seriously, some other ""instructors"" out there can't even keep straight planes!).  This would be great for a very new beginner, but doesn't get too detailed.  Over all, not a bad DVD to have in your Poi library.",4,"Overall, not too shabby",1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,342,"['was', 'one', 'better', 'poi', 'spinning', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'Michelle', 'fluid', 'graceful', 'can', 'actually', 'keep', 'planes', 'even', 'seriously', 'other', 'instructors', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'keep', 'straight', 'planes', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'very', 'new', 'beginner', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'detailed', 'not', 'bad', 'DVD', 'have', 'Poi', 'library']",Poi Spinning for Beginners also includes Veil Poi instruction for Belly Dancers
1104152,A1RMLJ5LPDM21N,B000VU2T8U,"D.J. ""Dava Jay""","[32, 33]","This is an excellent instructional DVD for anyone wanting to learn the basic foundation of poi spinning.  It is marketed to belly dancers because of the veil poi segment, but 90%  of this video is just the breakdown of regular poi moves.  There is a veil poi part, but it builds on moves already learned just with the veil.  In other words, it isn't just for belly dancers or totally focused on belly dancing at all.She is in front of a mirror, which makes it nice cause you can see the moves from behind also.  And there are loads of slow motion shots that were really useful.The teacher is a belly dancer and not a professional fire performer, but I liked that more.  She obviously has experience teaching movement because the mirrors are a great idea.  And the pace was perfect and the information was really well presented.  She showed how some dance moves could be combined with the poi moves, which was useful and fun.There are several really easy tricks mixed in with a lot of tough ones too and that kept it fun and challenging.  The teacher was positive and encouraging and it was a fun and relaxing DVD to watch.Overall, I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to learn poi.",5,Not just for belly dancers,1189728000,"09 14, 2007",2007,1196,"['excellent', 'instructional', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'learn', 'basic', 'foundation', 'poi', 'spinning', 'marketed', 'belly', 'dancers', 'veil', 'poi', 'segment', '90', '%', 'video', 'just', 'breakdown', 'regular', 'poi', 'moves', 'veil', 'poi', 'part', 'moves', 'already', 'learned', 'just', 'veil', 'other', 'words', ""n't"", 'just', 'belly', 'dancers', 'totally', 'focused', 'belly', 'dancing', 'all.She', 'front', 'mirror', 'nice', 'cause', 'can', 'see', 'moves', 'also', 'are', 'loads', 'slow', 'motion', 'shots', 'were', 'really', 'useful.The', 'teacher', 'belly', 'dancer', 'not', 'professional', 'fire', 'performer', 'liked', 'more', 'obviously', 'experience', 'teaching', 'movement', 'mirrors', 'are', 'great', 'idea', 'pace', 'was', 'perfect', 'information', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'presented', 'showed', 'how', 'dance', 'moves', 'could', 'be', 'combined', 'poi', 'moves', 'was', 'useful', 'are', 'several', 'really', 'easy', 'tricks', 'mixed', 'lot', 'tough', 'ones', 'too', 'kept', 'fun', 'challenging', 'teacher', 'was', 'positive', 'encouraging', 'was', 'fun', 'relaxing', 'DVD', 'watch.Overall', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'learn', 'poi']",Poi Spinning for Beginners also includes Veil Poi instruction for Belly Dancers

1104154,A2VSG9C77BOFPR,B000VU2T8U,micah brady,"[1, 1]","This instructional is good for beginners that learn well from video. The material is easy to follow and Michelle has the cameras angled towards her and the mirror. If you don't have any experience twirling anything or using your wrists, it may be hard to understand. It has a quick segment on selection of poi, several basic movements with regular tempo and slow motion that allows you to follow, a nice demonstration on combining movements and tempos to make things look more interesting, a very quick bit on veil poi, and two performance segments.I purchased this hoping for veil poi instruction for belly dancers, but there isn't much. Basically you can use the poi veil as double and single veils with lots of spins! I was hoping for a breakdown of which belly dance moves go best with which poi veil moves. She does a bit of demonstrating traveling camels with one poi trick, mayas with another, and maybe one other thing, but otherwise everything is turns, turns, and turns. The performance looks more like poi veil that just happens to be done in a belly dance costume. I was hoping for at least a discussion on how to layer hip movements with poi movements.",3,"It's fine as a poi veil instructional, but I was hoping for more belly dance layering with poi",1382486400,"10 23, 2013",2013,1165,"['instructional', 'good', 'beginners', 'learn', 'well', 'video', 'material', 'easy', 'follow', 'Michelle', 'cameras', 'angled', 'towards', 'mirror', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'experience', 'twirling', 'anything', 'using', 'wrists', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'understand', 'quick', 'segment', 'selection', 'poi', 'several', 'basic', 'movements', 'regular', 'tempo', 'slow', 'motion', 'follow', 'nice', 'demonstration', 'combining', 'movements', 'tempos', 'make', 'things', 'look', 'more', 'interesting', 'very', 'quick', 'bit', 'veil', 'poi', 'two', 'performance', 'segments.I', 'purchased', 'hoping', 'veil', 'poi', 'instruction', 'belly', 'dancers', ""n't"", 'much', 'Basically', 'can', 'use', 'poi', 'veil', 'double', 'single', 'veils', 'lots', 'spins', 'was', 'hoping', 'breakdown', 'belly', 'dance', 'moves', 'go', 'best', 'poi', 'veil', 'moves', 'bit', 'demonstrating', 'traveling', 'camels', 'one', 'poi', 'trick', 'mayas', 'maybe', 'one', 'other', 'thing', 'otherwise', 'everything', 'turns', 'performance', 'more', 'poi', 'veil', 'just', 'be', 'done', 'belly', 'dance', 'costume', 'was', 'hoping', 'least', 'discussion', 'how', 'layer', 'hip', 'movements', 'poi', 'movements']",Poi Spinning for Beginners also includes Veil Poi instruction for Belly Dancers
