Always helpful to hear from the guys who may not have been superstars in their heyday, nor even Hall of Famers now.  The extra features from each team's DVD are a real nice touch as well.Just plain ""win"" with this collection.

In separate vignettes for each season, the NFL has extracted poignant, powerful and funny interviews with current and former players and coaches. They bring each Super Bowl to life in a new, interesting, personal, and insightful way.All our favorite teams are here - the 72-73 Dolphins, 85 Bears, 1971 Cowboys, Green Bay Packers, Steelers, Patriots, and everyone else. The NFL has created somethig special with this set.The only thing that might make it a little better is an HD format. Nonetheless, the quality and production is first class.",4,This is special.,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,630,"['more', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'NFL', 'best', 'as', 'sweet', 'may', 'be', 'separate', 'vignettes', 'season', 'NFL', 'extracted', 'poignant', 'powerful', 'funny', 'interviews', 'current', 'former', 'players', 'coaches', 'bring', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'life', 'new', 'interesting', 'personal', 'insightful', 'way.All', 'favorite', 'teams', 'are', 'here', '72-73', 'Dolphins', '85', 'Bears', '1971', 'Cowboys', 'Green', 'Bay', 'Packers', 'Steelers', 'Patriots', 'everyone', 'else', 'NFL', 'created', 'somethig', 'special', 'only', 'thing', 'might', 'make', 'little', 'better', 'HD', 'format', 'Nonetheless', 'quality', 'production', 'first', 'class']",NFL America's Game Super Bowl I-XL

I follow an NFL team, like everyone else. but i loved the series so much i bought this whole box-set as I'm a football fan above all.

1099965,A2J7J29ZQ5MZ80,B000VAHQW4,"S. Burrow ""Chess Player""","[9, 11]","I bought the Superbowl Collector's Set and intended to return America's Game, not even cracked open but still factory sealed.  The reason was the reviews that I read which said the Collector's Set was action/highlights and America's Game was more interviews and extras with highlights tossed in here and there.  Well, thanks to a great wife and a gamble, I have both sets.  I don't spend money liberally so I had to think about this. I did not return America's Game; I opened it because the reviews that I read led me to believe that both were great for different reasons.  I can say this.  Having both sets is like two sides of one golden coin.  Both are beautiful in different ways.  Each has something the other lacks.  America's Game is full of highlights but uses them to illustrate the stories instead of using highlights to tell the stories.  And it is FULL of stories you probably never heard during the football seasons and Superbowls of their times!  These is a great set, just like the Collector's set.  Buy America's Game for the stories and extras; buy the Collector's set if you just want to watch season and Superbowl coverage highlights with that classic NFL narration and music.  One word of warning: like the Collector's Set, this set suffers from a quality control issue.  The packaging is done poorly.  There are scratched disks in both of these sets, some are pretty bad and I did not think they could possibly run.  They all do, at least all that I have looked at.  I don't know why this is, unless these are returned sets and they shouldn't be as both were factory sealed and I bought new sets.  Rough handling when being packed at the factory?  I was extremely careful with them as with all cd's and dvd's, since I HATE a skipping/damaged disk.  So far these are all OK and I'll keep them; I may get burned someday when I look at a disc and find one skips or whatever.  I'll take my chances since these are worth it and I don't have time to preview 60 dvd's.  But now I can watch them for a looonnnggggg time.",4,"Outstanding Superbowl Set, but.....",1270339200,"04 4, 2010",2010,2033,"['bought', 'Superbowl', 'Collector', 'Set', 'intended', 'return', 'America', 'Game', 'not', 'even', 'cracked', 'open', 'still', 'factory', 'sealed', 'reason', 'was', 'reviews', 'read', 'said', 'Collector', 'Set', 'was', 'action/highlights', 'America', 'Game', 'was', 'more', 'interviews', 'extras', 'highlights', 'tossed', 'here', 'there', 'Well', 'thanks', 'great', 'wife', 'gamble', 'have', 'sets', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'money', 'liberally', 'so', 'had', 'think', 'did', 'not', 'return', 'America', 'Game', 'opened', 'reviews', 'read', 'led', 'believe', 'were', 'great', 'different', 'reasons', 'can', 'say', 'Having', 'sets', 'two', 'sides', 'one', 'golden', 'coin', 'are', 'beautiful', 'different', 'ways', 'something', 'other', 'lacks', 'America', 'Game', 'full', 'highlights', 'illustrate', 'stories', 'instead', 'using', 'highlights', 'tell', 'stories', 'FULL', 'stories', 'probably', 'never', 'heard', 'football', 'seasons', 'Superbowls', 'times', 'great', 'set', 'just', 'Collector', 'set', 'Buy', 'America', 'Game', 'stories', 'extras', 'buy', 'Collector', 'set', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'season', 'Superbowl', 'coverage', 'highlights', 'classic', 'NFL', 'narration', 'music', 'One', 'word', 'warning', 'Collector', 'Set', 'set', 'suffers', 'quality', 'control', 'issue', 'packaging', 'done', 'poorly', 'are', 'scratched', 'disks', 'sets', 'are', 'pretty', 'bad', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'could', 'possibly', 'run', 'do', 'least', 'have', 'looked', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'are', 'returned', 'sets', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'were', 'factory', 'sealed', 'bought', 'new', 'sets', 'Rough', 'handling', 'when', 'being', 'packed', 'factory', 'was', 'extremely', 'careful', 'cd', 'dvd', 'HATE', 'skipping/damaged', 'disk', 'So', 'far', 'are', 'OK', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'may', 'get', 'burned', 'someday', 'when', 'look', 'disc', 'find', 'one', 'skips', ""'ll"", 'take', 'chances', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'preview', '60', 'dvd', 'now', 'can', 'watch', 'looonnnggggg', 'time']",NFL America's Game Super Bowl I-XL
1099966,A3UNGGV9D2UVQY,B000VAHQW4,Stephane Lauzon,"[23, 23]","I love a good work of fiction but sometimes reality can be very entertaining. This series is well-made and so intense and passionate that it brought me to tears more than one time. Every episode is a unique road to the superbowl by the team who won it and told by 3 important actors of the team. The 1985 conquest of the Bears for example is told by Mike Ditka, Mike Singletary and Jim McMahon. The stories that leads to the big game are fascinating, touching and often surprising. I love the series so much that I was comtemplating buying the first DVDs on the market which focus on one particular team and all the superbowls they won. But now, I was happy to see that they compile everything in one package. The packaging is very well made, the 40 DVDs being separated in 4 eras (66-75)(76-85)(86-95)and (96-05), 10 discs by DVD. Also, an interesting 88 page book with every conquest by every team. On the DVDs you have also a bunch of interviews that we couldn't see on the NFL network. If you love the NFL this is a great work by NFL films and Steve Sabol and a great piece of history to possess. The only thing missing is the Colts Superbowl last year but the documentary is about the first 40 Superbowl so we can't have everything unfortunately.",5,Nothing like reality,1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,1251,"['love', 'good', 'work', 'fiction', 'sometimes', 'reality', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'series', 'well-made', 'so', 'intense', 'passionate', 'brought', 'tears', 'more', 'one', 'time', 'episode', 'unique', 'road', 'superbowl', 'team', 'who', 'won', 'told', '3', 'important', 'actors', 'team', '1985', 'conquest', 'Bears', 'example', 'told', 'Mike', 'Ditka', 'Mike', 'Singletary', 'Jim', 'McMahon', 'stories', 'big', 'game', 'are', 'fascinating', 'touching', 'often', 'surprising', 'love', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'comtemplating', 'buying', 'first', 'DVDs', 'market', 'focus', 'one', 'particular', 'team', 'superbowls', 'won', 'now', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'compile', 'everything', 'one', 'package', 'packaging', 'very', 'well', 'made', '40', 'DVDs', 'being', 'separated', '4', 'eras', '66-75', '76-85', '86-95', '96-05', '10', 'discs', 'DVD', 'Also', 'interesting', '88', 'page', 'book', 'conquest', 'team', 'DVDs', 'have', 'also', 'bunch', 'interviews', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'NFL', 'network', 'love', 'NFL', 'great', 'work', 'NFL', 'films', 'Steve', 'Sabol', 'great', 'piece', 'history', 'possess', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'Colts', 'Superbowl', 'last', 'year', 'documentary', 'first', '40', 'Superbowl', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'everything', 'unfortunately']",NFL America's Game Super Bowl I-XL
