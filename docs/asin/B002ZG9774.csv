I am not going into details about the plot because everyone should know it by now, but if you're looking for a good, entertaining movie with great music, dancing, chemistry, and awesome performances that compliment the musical genre - then this is the movie to watch.Christina's amazing voice and nice acting ability balance this movie perfectly. Cher & Stanley Tucci as the comedic duo are head on with their lines, comedic talent, and outstanding presence. It's a bit strange to see Cher acting in a movie when she is 64 and looks 31 in the film, but it is great to see her back in a film and on top of her game. Christina can act. I didn't dread any of the moments when she had screen time (I can't say that for everyone who is a singer turned actress). However, I just wish there was MORE dancing. I felt like an extra ten minutes of more dancing, of another musical sequence would have been a welcome.Get the DVD/Blu Ray combo.

Cher, Christina Aguilara, Stanley Tucci... all good performances, especially if you like them anyway in other things, but probably not too far from who they really are in real life - making their performances ultimately predictably good.The story is light, there aren't any real surprises.  This isn't a problem because the majority of the film is back to back musical numbers which really don't add to the story other than by illustrating the meaning of the word 'Burlesque' and stressing the group as an entertainment family.  The relationships (such as they are...) are believable enough to keep you hoping for a happy ending for everyone, and you get it.Burlesque wouldn't make my all-time top 50, but it might make #51.

Yet, the choreography and movement and design of those numbers was ruined by an editor that tried to get too cutesty with his editing skills. Every 3 second and every drum beat, there's an edit, or a different angle, not just on one or two numbers, but every single musical number is edited like they came from the MTV school of editing. Not to mention, they would cut away from numbers to do montage moments of storyline which was really unnecessary.BURLESQUE has its problems with story, like the fact that Ali (Christina Aguilera), goes from being an Iowa diner waitress to Los Angeles without needing a single moment of practice or trials in order to be as good as the girls who are already performing. We the audience are just supposed to believe that she is just one of those few people in the world who don't have to work at it, their just plain good. Sorry, even Christina Aguilera didn't become Christina Aguilera without some work and struggles.The script is pretty vanilla as well, which makes it even worse that they took up moments of dance and music to break away from what was happening on stage to show us montages of pointless stuff, like Aguilera sleeping, or Cher talking about her mortgage paying woes. All of which was covered adequately enough with dozens of other scenes.Bottom line though, people came into BURLESQUE wanting to see the singing and dancing, and what was there was exceptional if you don't get nautious with the rapidfire editing and the moments of conversation or montages that break up the performances.  The creators of BURLESQUE and the editor of BURLESQUE got overly creative and should have just let the music and dancing do the talking, instead of trying to spruce up already great numbers with spastic editing.",3,MTV style editing spoils what could have been a great musical,1299196800,"03 4, 2011",2011,1903,"['BURLESQUE', 'had', 'fantastic', 'choreography', 'music', 'what', 'was', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'make', 'memorable', 'movie', 'years', 'come', 'choreography', 'movement', 'design', 'numbers', 'was', 'ruined', 'editor', 'tried', 'get', 'too', 'cutesty', 'editing', 'skills', '3', 'second', 'drum', 'beat', 'edit', 'different', 'angle', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'two', 'numbers', 'single', 'musical', 'number', 'edited', 'came', 'MTV', 'school', 'editing', 'Not', 'mention', 'would', 'cut', 'away', 'numbers', 'do', 'montage', 'moments', 'storyline', 'was', 'really', 'unnecessary.BURLESQUE', 'problems', 'story', 'fact', 'Ali', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'being', 'Iowa', 'diner', 'waitress', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'needing', 'single', 'moment', 'practice', 'trials', 'order', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'performing', 'audience', 'are', 'just', 'supposed', 'believe', 'just', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'world', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'work', 'just', 'plain', 'good', 'Sorry', 'even', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'work', 'struggles.The', 'script', 'pretty', 'vanilla', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'worse', 'took', 'up', 'moments', 'dance', 'music', 'break', 'away', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'stage', 'show', 'montages', 'pointless', 'stuff', 'Aguilera', 'sleeping', 'Cher', 'talking', 'mortgage', 'paying', 'woes', 'was', 'covered', 'adequately', 'enough', 'dozens', 'other', 'scenes.Bottom', 'line', 'people', 'came', 'BURLESQUE', 'wanting', 'see', 'singing', 'dancing', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'exceptional', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'nautious', 'rapidfire', 'editing', 'moments', 'conversation', 'montages', 'break', 'up', 'performances', 'creators', 'BURLESQUE', 'editor', 'BURLESQUE', 'got', 'overly', 'creative', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'let', 'music', 'dancing', 'do', 'talking', 'instead', 'trying', 'spruce', 'up', 'already', 'great', 'numbers', 'spastic', 'editing']",Burlesque

Her face is definitely a familiar one to all of us and maybe that's what makes it feel like she's been acting for so long. She's a natural.Much like musicians Eminem and 50 Cent did, Aguilera chooses to play a character close to home for her big screen debut; you guessed it - an aspiring singer / dancer.She's small-town girl Ali, and ups and leaves with her life savings to head to Los Angles to make it big. When she arrives, she's a little overwhelmed by the big city rush, but soon enough finds herself in a dark and tiny club called Burlesque. She enters just in time to see Cher's character Tess, performing on stage. Naturally, she's captivated, and so are we: Cher's still got it, folks.Tess owns the club, and is on the verge of losing it to a rich L.A. playboy, Marcus (Eric Dane). Dane plays Marcus as nice a villain as he can be, and villain or not - I was forced into liking the character. Dane is a blast, and I look forward to seeing him in more things.Tess's ex-husband and co-owner Vince (Peter Gallagher) is on Marcus's side, and wants her to sell. Tess has too many memories, and buried dreams rooted in her little club though, and to sell it would be to sell her soul. But when money isn't exactly flowing in, whatever is she to do?Luckily, Ali is smitten with Burlesque, and is determined to get a job there. After she is told to come back and audition by Tess and her assistant, Sean (Stanley Tucci); there's a nice little moment where Ali decides to first pick up a tray and start waitressing right there on the spot. This catches Tess's attention and more importantly this early on in the story, the attention of the bar tender, Jack (Cam Gigandent).After an unfortunate incident, Ali finds herself homeless with nowhere to go. So she shacks up with Jack, who is a safe fix because she works with him, and he has a fianc&eacute;. I enjoyed these scenes a lot, as Cam and Christina had amazing chemistry, and it was a lot of fun to see their feelings for one another boiling, with the conflict of Jack's fianc&eacute;, keeping them from acting on them.And of course, we have the witch-character that is the club's best entertainer under Tess, until Ali comes along. Kristen Bell, plays the snarky alcoholic Nikki, to a T; which is due much praise, as we all know what a sweetheart she can be.I've given you a lot with the characters alone, and hopefully that's enough. You can see how they will interact with one another and move the story forward. The plot and story arks we've seen a million times before, but the actors all do their jobs effortlessly, and we get some breaks from the melodrama by big musical scores that were put together quite nicely.In addition to her great acting performance, Christina Aguilera delivers some jaw dropping dance moves and her voice sounds only better in digital surround sound.Burlesque probably should have been an R-rated film, with more adult driven dialogue and some nudity; something one would expect to find in a club called `Burlesque'.

You can also look at the very handsome lead actor, Jack, for some eye candy.  Maybe you view them as role models, perhaps (and maybe you fine lesbians can whet your whistle a bit!).  For the guys, well...you can look at all the gorgeous women too and get your male juices flowing.  For the gay men out there, of course there's lots to love!

Rather than being remotely provocative in subject or treatment, the film is actually a slapdash, new-millennium update of42nd Streetin which the classic 1933 movie's most famous line, ""You're going out a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!"", applies perfectly here. The youngster in this case is pop star Christina Aguilera in her feature film debut as Ali Rose, a plucky Iowa waitress described scabrously by an alcohol-fueled rival named Nikki as a ""slut with mutant lungs"". Your reaction to that comment will depend on how much you like Aguilera's throaty, blues-inspired holler of a singing voice. You would have to enjoy it a lot to sit through the several production numbers she performs in the movie.The story is trite. Ali leaves Iowa for LA on a bus and faces exactly one day of unemployment during our current economic malaise when she discovers the Burlesque Lounge on the Sunset Strip. Talking her way into a waitress job thanks to sympathetic bartender Jack, she desperately tries to persuade the club's owner Tess that she belongs on the stage with all the leggy, lip-synching dancers. A dancer's unplanned pregnancy gives Ali the chance to audition and take her place, and then conveniently, Tess picks Ali to substitute for a drunken Nikki to take the lead one night. Out of spite, Nikki cuts off the recorded music at which point Ali sings in her own voice. In perhaps the most patronizing scene, the awestruck reactions of customers and colleagues insure her immediate stardom and Nikki's vengeful wrath. As Ali's star ascends, she is also caught in a romantic triangle between Jack and a wealthy opportunist named Marcus.Meanwhile, Tess faces the prospect of losing her club despite the good fortune brought forth by Ali's emerging fame. If you can't figure out the rest of the by-the-numbers plot, clearly you don't get out much. Even though the film is a showcase for Aguilera, it is really Cher who anchors it with her dry insouciance and sheer professionalism. At 64, she looks great in a highly cosmeticized way, but it's really her natural likability and her two standout numbers that linger in the memory. The first is a teasing nod to ""Cabaret"" called ""Welcome to Burlesque"" and the second is a Diane Warren-penned power ballad, ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"", which she sings with the same emotional fervor Jennifer Hudson did with her bigDreamgirlsnumber, ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"". Aguilera acquits herself well as Ali. It's just that the role is such a predictable set of clich&eacute;s when she's offstage.As Tess' loyal confidante, Stanley Tucci plays almost exactly the same role he played inThe Devil Wears Pradaand in the same wry manner that works just as well here. Cam Gigandet as Jack and Eric Dane as Marcus aren't given much opportunity to make memorable impressions. Kristen Bell has a few choice moments showing her talons as Nikki. Shallow entertainment for those in the mood for it. Extras are plentiful but not indispensable on the 2011 DVD/Blu-Ray. There is a talky but none too insightful commentary track from Antin, an alternate opening sequence that extends the Iowa setting, a five-minute blooper reel, and footage of six uncut musical numbers. The Blue-Ray additionally offers a five-part making-of featurette for true fans of the film.",3,A Well Preserved Cher Keeps This Predictable Pile of Showbiz Clich&eacute;s Afloat,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,3582,"['eye-catching', 'veneer', 'stylistic', 'cross', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'Cabaret', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'Chicago', '2010', 'backstage', 'musical', 'written', 'directed', 'former', 'actor', 'Steve', 'Antin', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'hokum', 'repackaged', 'theAmerican', 'Idolgeneration', 'Rather', 'being', 'remotely', 'provocative', 'subject', 'treatment', 'film', 'actually', 'slapdash', 'new-millennium', 'update', 'of42nd', 'Streetin', 'classic', '1933', 'movie', 'most', 'famous', 'line', ""'re"", 'going', 'out', 'youngster', ""'ve"", 'got', 'come', 'back', 'star', 'perfectly', 'here', 'youngster', 'case', 'pop', 'star', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'Ali', 'Rose', 'plucky', 'Iowa', 'waitress', 'described', 'scabrously', 'alcohol-fueled', 'rival', 'named', 'Nikki', 'slut', 'mutant', 'lungs', 'reaction', 'comment', 'will', 'depend', 'how', 'much', 'Aguilera', 'throaty', 'blues-inspired', 'holler', 'singing', 'voice', 'would', 'have', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'sit', 'several', 'production', 'numbers', 'movie.The', 'story', 'trite', 'Ali', 'Iowa', 'LA', 'bus', 'exactly', 'one', 'day', 'unemployment', 'current', 'economic', 'malaise', 'when', 'Burlesque', 'Lounge', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'Talking', 'way', 'waitress', 'job', 'thanks', 'sympathetic', 'bartender', 'Jack', 'desperately', 'persuade', 'club', 'owner', 'Tess', 'stage', 'leggy', 'lip-synching', 'dancers', 'dancer', 'unplanned', 'pregnancy', 'Ali', 'chance', 'audition', 'take', 'place', 'then', 'conveniently', 'Tess', 'Ali', 'substitute', 'drunken', 'Nikki', 'take', 'lead', 'one', 'night', 'spite', 'Nikki', 'recorded', 'music', 'point', 'Ali', 'sings', 'own', 'voice', 'perhaps', 'most', 'patronizing', 'scene', 'awestruck', 'reactions', 'customers', 'colleagues', 'insure', 'immediate', 'stardom', 'Nikki', 'vengeful', 'wrath', 'Ali', 'star', 'ascends', 'also', 'caught', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'Jack', 'wealthy', 'opportunist', 'named', 'Marcus.Meanwhile', 'Tess', 'prospect', 'losing', 'club', 'good', 'fortune', 'brought', 'forth', 'Ali', 'emerging', 'fame', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'rest', 'by-the-numbers', 'plot', 'clearly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'out', 'much', 'Even', 'film', 'showcase', 'Aguilera', 'really', 'Cher', 'who', 'dry', 'insouciance', 'sheer', 'professionalism', '64', 'great', 'highly', 'cosmeticized', 'way', 'really', 'natural', 'likability', 'two', 'standout', 'numbers', 'linger', 'memory', 'first', 'teasing', 'nod', 'Cabaret', 'called', 'Welcome', 'Burlesque', 'second', 'Diane', 'Warren-penned', 'power', 'ballad', 'Have', ""n't"", 'Seen', 'Last', 'Me', 'same', 'emotional', 'fervor', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'did', 'bigDreamgirlsnumber', 'Am', 'Telling', ""'m"", 'Not', 'Going', 'Aguilera', 'well', 'Ali', 'just', 'role', 'such', 'predictable', 'set', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'when', 'offstage.As', 'Tess', 'loyal', 'confidante', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'role', 'played', 'inThe', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Pradaand', 'same', 'wry', 'manner', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'here', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'Jack', 'Eric', 'Dane', 'Marcus', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'opportunity', 'make', 'memorable', 'impressions', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'few', 'choice', 'moments', 'showing', 'talons', 'Nikki', 'Shallow', 'entertainment', 'mood', 'Extras', 'are', 'plentiful', 'not', 'indispensable', '2011', 'DVD/Blu-Ray', 'talky', 'none', 'too', 'insightful', 'commentary', 'track', 'Antin', 'alternate', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Iowa', 'setting', 'five-minute', 'blooper', 'reel', 'footage', 'six', 'uncut', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Blue-Ray', 'additionally', 'five-part', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'true', 'fans', 'film']",Burlesque

The big surprise is Christina Aguilera and the caliber of acting from the stars that makes ""Burlesque"" the show to watch. ""Burlesque"" is the movie that ""Showgirls"" never was and never will be, sex with heart.Stanley Tucci is superb as the gay dresser and Cher's (Tess) best friend. He is at his campy best and Cher isn't far behind, playing the owner with vamp appeal and a world-weary brittleness that is vintage Cher. She does need to stop with the collagen injections; her mouth is far too stiff, but her voice, like a fine Napoleon Brandy, has improved with age.The real star of ""Burlesque"" is the stunning and sweet Christina Aguilera, whose voice is as rich as her style. She plays naive and eager Ali on a believable note that is almost as good as her singing. The dancing is a little less than perfect, but, like Stanley Tucci says, you can't take your eyes off her.",4,Burlesque With Heart,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,959,"['plot', 'simple', 'girl', 'Midwest', 'LA', 'make', 'big', 'surprise', 'there', 'big', 'surprise', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'caliber', 'acting', 'stars', 'Burlesque', 'show', 'watch', 'Burlesque', 'movie', 'Showgirls', 'never', 'was', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'sex', 'heart.Stanley', 'Tucci', 'superb', 'gay', 'dresser', 'Cher', 'Tess', 'best', 'friend', 'campy', 'best', 'Cher', ""n't"", 'far', 'playing', 'owner', 'vamp', 'appeal', 'world-weary', 'brittleness', 'vintage', 'Cher', 'need', 'stop', 'collagen', 'injections', 'mouth', 'far', 'too', 'stiff', 'voice', 'fine', 'Napoleon', 'Brandy', 'improved', 'age.The', 'real', 'star', 'Burlesque', 'stunning', 'sweet', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'voice', 'as', 'rich', 'style', 'naive', 'eager', 'Ali', 'believable', 'note', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'singing', 'dancing', 'little', 'less', 'perfect', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes']",Burlesque

First, the story has been told a thousand times: Aguilera is sick of her backwater home town. So she puts on her best Dorothy Gale gingham bustier, packs up her little basket of vocal chords and goes over the rainbow to join the cast of Glee as they re-imagine 'Showgirls' (and oh, how I was longing for someone to get pushed down the stairs).As for Cher, she was a campy-trampy imitation Mae West at best. This 'hooker with a heart of gold' cliche made me sad to remember Cher the Real Actress.  You know, back when she was kicking Hollywood's pretentious *ss around the block?  Come Back to the Five & Dime, Jimmy Dean. Silkwood. Mask. Moonstruck. Of course, that was also when she could still move some of her facial muscles. She may be delivering Oscar-worthy performances, we just can't see it happening.And poor Stanley Tucci! You could tell he was embarrassed. Every time he hit the screen he was made of pain. Pain like peanut butter stuck in your throat. Pain like full body paper cuts in a vat of stewed tomatoes. So sad.Truly, this is no Moulin Rouge.

1300976,A17DCPYMLXV1S4,B002ZG9774,Kay Shackleton,"[5, 10]","Once upon a time there was a little girl with a big voice. This little girl named Christina was a lucky girl indeed as she belonged to a very special club. This club helped to show off her beautiful voice and become a star. And as this girl became a young woman she found riches and fame much like the princesses of yesterday. But this girl was not happy with her place in the world. She shed all attributes that made her a star and ventured out to find happiness in being unique and different. This transformation confused her fans and eventually this young girl had no career at all. And though her other club mates found even greater fortune and fame, this girl was lost and having turn her nose up to all those that helped her career along the way - had no one left to help her back to her righteous place in the world.So, this girl was in need of extra help. But she had already used a genie in a bottle to help her before, and only one hope remained - this girl would pray to her Fairy God Mother. So, this girl, Christina Aguilera, grasped her microphone in hand and gazed deeply into the spot lot and sang her deepest note to bring forth the Fairy God Mother of all pop stars - Cher.With the release of the film Burlesque, many wonder if the pairing of Cher with Christina Aguilera can give Christina's career a lift. Burlesque is best described as a full feature music video. It is a campy, corny, and a contagiously fun film. Cher fans will be treated as she performs two songs and Stanley Tucci is good compliment to Cher's character as the Burlesque owner.  Julianne Hough (from Dancing with the Stars fame) and Kristen Bell make interesting foes to Aguilera's eagerness to rise to the top of the show. And Cam Gigandet's good looks and charming personality are well fit as Christina's love interest.All in all, if you like musicals (fans of Chicago will especially like this film) and want a few minutes to escape, Burlesque will not displease you.
