348667,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,6302969824,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[1, 1]","Basil Dearden's seldom seen 1960 heist film The League of Gentlemen has provided the template for almost every significant heist film which has followed it from Oceans 11 to the Italian Job and others.The film follows the exploits of Hyde (Jack Hawkins) an ex British military officer who has been forced into mandatory retirement as he plans and executes a major British bank robbery. Gathering around him a group of exmilitary experts he puts together a methodical robbery plan that he feels is gauranteed not to fail. The excellent ensemble cast includes Nigel Patrick (Race), Roger Livesey (Mycroft) and Richard Attenborough (Lexy).The film starts rather slowly as the plan is hatched but then moves into overdrive as the actual planning of the robbery is organized. This is droll British comedy and takes some patience to get into but careful viewers will be rewarded. The film is a satire of British life as it moved from the rather rigid 1950's into the more freewheeling 1960's.The comedy works because of the mood Dearden creates. Look for an especially funny arms depot robbery in the center of the film that successfully skewers British army life at the time. There is also a moral message that crime doesn't pay but I won't give away the details of how the robbery goes astray.All in all a pleasurable viewing experience if one takes his time watching it. The film is only available on video from Homevision in Region 1 but there are no problems to speak of with the tape. The print is slightly faded but is not difficult to watch. The dialogue is crisp and clear even though slightly complex. This is a film to see if given the chance and if it can be found.Highly recommended.",4,Template For Just About All Caper Films To Follow,1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,1690,"['Basil', 'Dearden', 'seldom', 'seen', '1960', 'heist', 'film', 'League', 'Gentlemen', 'provided', 'template', 'almost', 'significant', 'heist', 'film', 'followed', '11', 'Italian', 'Job', 'others.The', 'film', 'exploits', 'Hyde', 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'ex', 'British', 'military', 'officer', 'who', 'been', 'forced', 'mandatory', 'retirement', 'major', 'British', 'bank', 'robbery', 'Gathering', 'group', 'exmilitary', 'experts', 'together', 'methodical', 'robbery', 'plan', 'gauranteed', 'not', 'fail', 'excellent', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Nigel', 'Patrick', 'Race', 'Roger', 'Livesey', 'Mycroft', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'Lexy', '.The', 'film', 'rather', 'slowly', 'plan', 'hatched', 'then', 'overdrive', 'actual', 'planning', 'robbery', 'organized', 'droll', 'British', 'comedy', 'patience', 'get', 'careful', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'film', 'satire', 'British', 'life', 'moved', 'rather', 'rigid', '1950', 'more', 'freewheeling', ""1960's.The"", 'comedy', 'works', 'mood', 'Dearden', 'Look', 'especially', 'funny', 'arms', 'depot', 'robbery', 'center', 'film', 'successfully', 'British', 'army', 'life', 'time', 'also', 'moral', 'message', 'crime', ""n't"", 'pay', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'details', 'how', 'robbery', 'astray.All', 'pleasurable', 'viewing', 'experience', 'one', 'time', 'watching', 'film', 'only', 'available', 'video', 'Homevision', 'Region', '1', 'are', 'problems', 'speak', 'tape', 'print', 'slightly', 'faded', 'not', 'difficult', 'watch', 'dialogue', 'crisp', 'clear', 'even', 'slightly', 'complex', 'film', 'see', 'given', 'chance', 'can', 'be', 'found.Highly', 'recommended']",League of Gentlemen VHS

DeRiemer,"[0, 0]","""Think of it as a full-scale military operation,"" says involuntarily retired Colonel Hyde (Jack Hawkins) to cashiered ex-Major Race (Nigel Patrick). ""What chance has a bunch of ordinary civilians have against a trained, armed and disciplined military group?"" Hyde did not for one moment like being forced into retirement after 25 years in the British army. He spent the last few days of active duty doing some research among personnel files. Now, Hyde plans to get a bit of his own back...and Race, along with six other former officers, are going to be the means. Please note that elements of the plot are discussed.The League of Gentlemen is a cynical, stylish, witty film about a bank heist carried out with the precision of a Swiss watch, all thanks to Hyde's meticulous research. Among the seven men he recruits are Race, charming, shrewd, imperturbable and a reliable second-in-command...even if he does tend to call people ""old darling."" Race was forced to resign his commission because of a bit of black marketeering. Mycroft (Roger Livesey) was a superb quartermaster who was discovered in a bit of gross indecency in a public place. Lexy (Richard Attenborough), a talented and crooked mechanic and whiz with radios, was found to be selling secrets to the Russians. Porthill (Bryan Forbes) is always resourceful and is now a gigolo, but was discovered to be shooting prisoners in Cyprus. The others all had problems with being weak, or being discovered as one of those whose love dare not be spoken of, or of being responsible for the deaths of men under them. But, as Hyde points out, they were all superbly trained officers and they all need money.Hyde brings them together with an anonymous invitation to lunch in the Maple Room of the elegant Cafe Royal. Included in the envelope is a copy of a book, The Golden Fleece, and half a five-pound note. After a fine lunch with a decent wine, brandy, cigars and the other half of the fiver, Hyde gets down to business. The mission? They will rob a very big and well-protected bank in the heart of central London, make off with at least 100,000 British pounds each and then live happily ever after. It will be called Operation Golden Fleece. With just a little reliance on greed, self-interest and perhaps a hint of coercion, he recruits them. Before long we're deep into training and organizing, setting up communications and stealing transport. In an amusing, tense sequence almost good enough to be a movie itself, they also bluff their way into an Army base and steal a substantial amount of arms. Do they actually pull off this complex heist that calls for split-second timing, nerves as cold as ice and flawless teamwork. Well, of course, and we get to watch it happen. Do they get away to lead a life of leisure? You'll need to see the movie. Be prepared for a very funny appearance by a twit of an old comrade of Hyde's, Bunny Warren (Robert Coote), and a twist which is handled with a stylish dollop of jaunty ruefulness.Jack Hawkins, with that rough voice and no-nonsense face, does a fine job as Hyde, a man who can see the amusement in having few illusions. There is quite a collection of first-rate British actors in the men around Hawkins and they all are excellent. Bryan Forbes also wrote the screenplay. He was a clever actor who wrote and directed some fine movies, among themThe L-Shaped Room,Seance on a Wet AfternoonandKing Rat.",4,"A first-rate movie, witty and cynical, about a disgruntled, forcibly retired Army colonel and what he does about it",1248566400,"07 26, 2009",2009,3404,"['Think', 'full-scale', 'military', 'operation', 'involuntarily', 'retired', 'Colonel', 'Hyde', 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'cashiered', 'ex-Major', 'Race', 'Nigel', 'Patrick', 'What', 'chance', 'bunch', 'ordinary', 'civilians', 'have', 'trained', 'armed', 'disciplined', 'military', 'group', 'Hyde', 'did', 'not', 'one', 'moment', 'being', 'forced', 'retirement', '25', 'years', 'British', 'army', 'spent', 'last', 'few', 'days', 'active', 'duty', 'doing', 'research', 'personnel', 'files', 'Now', 'Hyde', 'get', 'bit', 'own', 'back', 'Race', 'six', 'other', 'former', 'officers', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'means', 'Please', 'note', 'elements', 'plot', 'are', 'discussed.The', 'League', 'Gentlemen', 'cynical', 'stylish', 'witty', 'film', 'bank', 'heist', 'carried', 'precision', 'Swiss', 'watch', 'thanks', 'Hyde', 'meticulous', 'research', 'seven', 'men', 'are', 'Race', 'charming', 'shrewd', 'imperturbable', 'reliable', 'second-in-command', 'even', 'tend', 'call', 'people', 'old', 'darling', 'Race', 'was', 'forced', 'resign', 'commission', 'bit', 'black', 'marketeering', 'Mycroft', 'Roger', 'Livesey', 'was', 'superb', 'quartermaster', 'who', 'was', 'discovered', 'bit', 'gross', 'indecency', 'public', 'place', 'Lexy', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'talented', 'crooked', 'mechanic', 'whiz', 'radios', 'was', 'found', 'be', 'selling', 'secrets', 'Russians', 'Porthill', 'Bryan', 'Forbes', 'always', 'resourceful', 'now', 'gigolo', 'was', 'discovered', 'be', 'shooting', 'prisoners', 'Cyprus', 'others', 'had', 'problems', 'being', 'weak', 'being', 'discovered', 'one', 'love', 'dare', 'not', 'be', 'spoken', 'being', 'responsible', 'deaths', 'men', 'Hyde', 'out', 'were', 'superbly', 'trained', 'officers', 'need', 'money.Hyde', 'brings', 'together', 'anonymous', 'invitation', 'lunch', 'Maple', 'Room', 'elegant', 'Cafe', 'Royal', 'Included', 'envelope', 'copy', 'book', 'Golden', 'Fleece', 'five-pound', 'note', 'fine', 'lunch', 'decent', 'wine', 'brandy', 'cigars', 'other', 'half', 'fiver', 'Hyde', 'down', 'business', 'mission', 'will', 'rob', 'very', 'big', 'well-protected', 'bank', 'heart', 'central', 'London', 'make', 'off', 'least', '100,000', 'British', 'pounds', 'then', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'will', 'be', 'called', 'Operation', 'Golden', 'Fleece', 'just', 'little', 'reliance', 'greed', 'self-interest', 'perhaps', 'hint', 'coercion', 'long', ""'re"", 'deep', 'training', 'organizing', 'setting', 'up', 'communications', 'stealing', 'transport', 'amusing', 'tense', 'sequence', 'almost', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'movie', 'also', 'bluff', 'way', 'Army', 'base', 'steal', 'substantial', 'amount', 'arms', 'Do', 'actually', 'pull', 'off', 'complex', 'heist', 'split-second', 'timing', 'nerves', 'as', 'cold', 'ice', 'flawless', 'teamwork', 'Well', 'course', 'get', 'watch', 'happen', 'Do', 'get', 'away', 'lead', 'life', 'leisure', ""'ll"", 'need', 'see', 'movie', 'Be', 'prepared', 'very', 'funny', 'appearance', 'twit', 'old', 'comrade', 'Hyde', 'Bunny', 'Warren', 'Robert', 'Coote', 'twist', 'handled', 'stylish', 'dollop', 'jaunty', 'ruefulness.Jack', 'Hawkins', 'rough', 'voice', 'no-nonsense', 'face', 'fine', 'job', 'Hyde', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'amusement', 'having', 'few', 'illusions', 'quite', 'collection', 'first-rate', 'British', 'actors', 'men', 'Hawkins', 'are', 'excellent', 'Bryan', 'Forbes', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'was', 'clever', 'actor', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'fine', 'movies', 'themThe', 'L-Shaped', 'Room', 'Seance', 'Wet', 'AfternoonandKing', 'Rat']",League of Gentlemen VHS

348671,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6302969824,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Fancy a good heist movie? If you can dig up 1960's LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN from under whichever rock it's languishing, you are in for a fine time. It's available as a VHS copy or a Region 2 DVD. For Yanks, THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN is one of the films in this Region 1 DVD collected set:Eclipse Series 25: Basil Dearden's London Underground (Sapphire / The League of Gentlemen / Victim / All Night Long) (The Criterion Collection). Else, you may have to wait until it pops up on TCM's play rotation. But it's very much worth a peek.It's a crackling yarn and a fine emissary of its genre. There's something about a heist film that allows the movie audience to sympathize with the crooks. Maybe it's got something to do with our innate blue collar distaste for them officious banking establishments. Anyway, we right away roll with Colonel Hyde (Jack Hawkins), an officer forced into retirement from the British Army and not too keen about it. It's not certain how much of the Colonel's turn to crime is motivated by his craving for a challenge versus his need for money. Hyde obviously relishes an exercise in problem solving. He applies his meticulous mind. He recruits seven disgraced soldiers to his venture, theorizing that no civilian entity stands a chance against the discipline and precise execution of the military trained. And he's right. That bank had no chance.Any heist movie worth a damn gratifies its audience with a detailed approach to the mechanics of the crime. THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN walks us thru each step of the robbery. Reminiscent of that classic ""silent"" scene in RIFIFI, the bank robbery is initially executed without dialogue, until someone asks for a match, at which point things proceed to get loud and chaotic.The ensemble cast - these crooks - is comprised of some of the UK's best character actors. Truly exceptional are the unctuous Nigel Patrick who naturally falls into the role of Hyde's second-in-command, Richard Attenborough as the unrepentant womanizer, and Roger Livesey as the mild-mannered pretend reverend. Livesey's hilarious standout scene has him - as outlined by Hyde - posing as a highly critical officer out to inspect a military base's kitchen. We meet each of these shady, neglected gents whom Hyde recruits thru his own sad introductory segment. Eight men in all, eight damaged goods. There's a sense of satisfaction derived from seeing these disparate personalities mesh and become a well-oiled machine. Almost palpable is this mournful undercurrent that exposes the somber, sometimes humiliating reality of a discarded soldier inhabiting a post-war England. War may be terrible, but it elevates certain men, after which the ensuing peace tosses them aside like so much detritus.Often go awry the plans of mice and men and exact British hooligans. From jump, one glaring flaw in Col. Hyde's plan is the mettle of his men, their many foibles and weaknesses. Heist pictures made during this period often ended with either a collapse in the execution or a falling out among the crooks or the happenstance of sheer awful luck. We're led on a string up 'til the very end. It's a bit ironic that their inevitable ruination comes at the unwitting hands of he who ""synchronizes the watches.""",4,"""The party's over.
