Better than average performances by Lindsey Wagner as the obsessive mother and Michelle Pfeifer as the son's wife, though it could have been, and probably was, a tv drama.  Video quality was average to acceptable in widescreen format, but not great.  The story itself gets interesting a good 40 minutes into it and carries you through the 140 minutes. Set mostly in Texas, it starts in the early 50s with the Korean War as backdrop, chronicles the Kennedy assassinations through to civil rights, Viet Nam and the 70s. The actors work best when the storyline reaches the 70s.  It won't be the best thing you've ever seen, though you could do worse.  Pfeifer is practically a teenager, and Wagner is still more or less in her prime.  I'll turn off a movie if it doesn't capture my interest somewhat.  This one fairly did.  I'd give it a strong 3.5 stars.  Possibly 4 depending on your criteria.",3,"Strong Performance By Lindsey Wagner, Early Michelle Pfeifer",1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,1109,"['story', 'woman', 'life', 'obsure', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'rise', 'power', 'wife', 'newspaper', 'mogul', 'who', 'leaving', 'son', 'thought', ""'d"", 'lost', 'position', 'considerable', 'power', 'Better', 'average', 'performances', 'Lindsey', 'Wagner', 'obsessive', 'mother', 'Michelle', 'Pfeifer', 'son', 'wife', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'probably', 'was', 'tv', 'drama', 'Video', 'quality', 'was', 'average', 'acceptable', 'widescreen', 'format', 'not', 'great', 'story', 'interesting', 'good', '40', 'minutes', '140', 'minutes', 'Set', 'mostly', 'Texas', 'early', '50s', 'Korean', 'War', 'backdrop', 'Kennedy', 'assassinations', 'civil', 'rights', 'Viet', 'Nam', '70s', 'actors', 'work', 'best', 'when', 'storyline', '70s', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'best', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'could', 'do', 'worse', 'Pfeifer', 'practically', 'teenager', 'Wagner', 'still', 'more', 'less', 'prime', ""'ll"", 'turn', 'off', 'movie', ""n't"", 'capture', 'interest', 'somewhat', 'one', 'fairly', 'did', ""'d"", 'give', 'strong', '3.5', 'stars', 'Possibly', '4', 'depending', 'criteria']",Callie & Son

I got my copy from the Dollar Store and it has another movie (Power Passion and Murder) with Michelle Pfeiffer in it as well... It really wasn't that bad, considering the price I paid. Lindsay Wagner is actually the main character and I think she did a great job, as did most of the actors in this film. The only trouble is the movie lasted about a hour longer than it needed to. With a bit of editing and a bit better script, it would have been a great movie! The end was somewhat unexpected and horrifying... I'd recommend it for someone to watch once, but I wouldn't pay more than I did for it. The DVD quality is really poor, the sound fades in and out, but for what it was, a bargain bin cheapy, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.",4,"Runs too Long, but acting is good...",1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,794,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Callie', 'Son', 'got', 'copy', 'Dollar', 'Store', 'movie', 'Power', 'Passion', 'Murder', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'considering', 'price', 'paid', 'Lindsay', 'Wagner', 'actually', 'main', 'character', 'think', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'did', 'most', 'actors', 'film', 'only', 'trouble', 'movie', 'lasted', 'hour', 'longer', 'needed', 'bit', 'editing', 'bit', 'better', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'end', 'was', 'somewhat', 'unexpected', 'horrifying', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'someone', 'watch', 'once', 'would', ""n't"", 'pay', 'more', 'did', 'DVD', 'quality', 'really', 'poor', 'sound', 'what', 'was', 'bargain', 'bin', 'cheapy', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed']",Callie & Son
787343,ACKNNX9U8NXX4,B0000VLLCU,Kevin Cochran,"[7, 8]","This movie had my head spinning. Lindsey Wagners character, Callie, is portrayed as down-trodden, ""please feel sorry for me"" woman...but then she marries into wealth, and starts doing just horrible, horrible things. The way it was presented in the movie, was like, she some kind of liberated woman who finally gave back a little dishing of what the world gave her...but not really, because in the beginning she made her own mistakes, no one did anything to her. Here's the headsplitting movie in a nutshell:1) Gives her baby up for adoption2) Marries a wealthy man3) Her wealthy husband ""buys"" her, now 5yr old, son back for her>>>at this point i think to myself, ""what about the adoptive parents?"" and what about the emotional harm inflicted on this child by ripping him away from the parents that raised him?4) Wealthy husband dies5) Husband left his company to the employees, But Callie stops it before it can happen, so SHE can run the company, and give it to her son.>>>Her husband was doing something really great for all the employees of that company, but selfish Callie stands up to the big bad board of directors, and keeps everything for herself.6) she kills her sons wife7) she lets her son take the blame for it8) her son is put to death in prison for the crime his mom committed. she never stopped it.9) Callies best friends give her a new baby to start the whole thing over10.....ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!When her friends give the second baby to Callie, they just pleasantly smile a satisfied smile, give a light-hearted sigh, and say ""well maybe she'll do better this time""Who wrote this movie? I mean really! 'Cause this stuff is just stupid! A movie has to be pretty bad before i remove it from my collection...I couldn't get this one in the trash fast enough!",1,What were they thinking? ****SPOILERS***,1274400000,"05 21, 2010",2010,1770,"['movie', 'had', 'head', 'spinning', 'Lindsey', 'Wagners', 'character', 'Callie', 'portrayed', 'down-trodden', 'please', 'feel', 'sorry', 'woman', 'then', 'wealth', 'doing', 'just', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'things', 'way', 'was', 'presented', 'movie', 'was', 'kind', 'liberated', 'woman', 'who', 'finally', 'gave', 'back', 'little', 'dishing', 'what', 'world', 'gave', 'not', 'really', 'beginning', 'made', 'own', 'mistakes', 'one', 'did', 'anything', 'Here', 'headsplitting', 'movie', 'nutshell:1', 'baby', 'up', 'adoption2', 'wealthy', 'man3', 'wealthy', 'husband', 'buys', 'now', '5yr', 'old', 'son', 'back', '>', '>', '>', 'point', 'i', 'think', 'myself', 'what', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'what', 'emotional', 'harm', 'inflicted', 'child', 'ripping', 'away', 'parents', 'raised', '4', 'Wealthy', 'husband', 'dies5', 'Husband', 'left', 'company', 'employees', 'Callie', 'can', 'happen', 'SHE', 'can', 'run', 'company', 'give', 'son.', '>', '>', '>', 'Her', 'husband', 'was', 'doing', 'something', 'really', 'great', 'employees', 'company', 'selfish', 'Callie', 'up', 'big', 'bad', 'board', 'directors', 'everything', 'herself.6', 'sons', 'wife7', 'son', 'take', 'blame', 'it8', 'son', 'put', 'death', 'prison', 'crime', 'mom', 'committed', 'never', 'stopped', 'it.9', 'Callies', 'best', 'friends', 'give', 'new', 'baby', 'start', 'whole', 'thing', 'over10', '..ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh', 'When', 'friends', 'give', 'second', 'baby', 'Callie', 'just', 'pleasantly', 'smile', 'satisfied', 'smile', 'give', 'light-hearted', 'sigh', 'say', 'well', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'do', 'better', 'time', 'Who', 'wrote', 'movie', 'mean', 'really', 'stuff', 'just', 'stupid', 'movie', 'be', 'pretty', 'bad', 'i', 'remove', 'collection', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'trash', 'fast', 'enough']",Callie & Son

But this dvd, the MGM release, is amazing, beautiful quality, and it has been remastered from the original master copy.The movie tells the story of a waitress (Lindsay Wagner) who works her way up the ladder, and eventually becomes a top publisher.
