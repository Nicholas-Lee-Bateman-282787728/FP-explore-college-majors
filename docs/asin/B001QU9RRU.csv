1232117,A12IRGQLFE4EBA,B001QU9RRU,"Fabulinus ""To err is human. To forgive for no...","[3, 4]","Yo Gabba Gabba is a Nick Jr television show.  Through the host (DJ Lance), special guests (including The Roots and Jack Black along with a few others), and some weird looking full size puppets (lol) Yo Gabba Gabba teaches children (target audience 3-6 yrs maybe) to express themselves and cooperate with their friends via free style music and dance.  It is very repetitive, bright, happy, and busy and does catch my 13 month old's attention.  Sometimes my child will wave at the screen when various characters ask the audience to respond to something.  The music is mostly what I would consider ""Techno-Pop.""Yo Gabba Gabba also has a very 70s Retro feel to it.  The costumes and puppets remind me of a program I used to watch as a kid, though I cannot quite put my finger on which one.  When I first saw it I couldn't stand it, but now both my daughter and I enjoy it and often sing or dance to the music on the show!  While a bit weird (to me), the show is fun, unique and has good messages throughout.",3,"Kind of Weird, But Good Messages",1307318400,"06 6, 2011",2011,1003,"['Yo', 'Gabba', 'Gabba', 'Nick', 'Jr', 'television', 'show', 'host', 'DJ', 'Lance', 'special', 'guests', 'including', 'Roots', 'Jack', 'Black', 'few', 'others', 'weird', 'looking', 'full', 'size', 'puppets', 'lol', 'Yo', 'Gabba', 'Gabba', 'children', 'target', 'audience', '3-6', 'yrs', 'maybe', 'express', 'cooperate', 'friends', 'free', 'style', 'music', 'dance', 'very', 'repetitive', 'bright', 'happy', 'busy', 'catch', '13', 'month', 'old', 'attention', 'child', 'will', 'wave', 'screen', 'when', 'various', 'characters', 'ask', 'audience', 'respond', 'something', 'music', 'mostly', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'Techno-Pop', 'Yo', 'Gabba', 'Gabba', 'also', 'very', '70s', 'Retro', 'feel', 'costumes', 'puppets', 'remind', 'program', 'used', 'watch', 'kid', 'can', 'not', 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'one', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'now', 'daughter', 'enjoy', 'often', 'sing', 'dance', 'music', 'show', 'bit', 'weird', 'show', 'fun', 'unique', 'good', 'messages']",Yo Gabba Gabba!: New Friends

He loves the songs like the friends one, good by song, and the lost song.  I personally love singing the song ""You can't always get what you want"" when my kids are not taking no for an answer.  My son also loves the Disco Roll that Jack Black teaches during dancey dance time.  He does this dance randomly all the time!I have come to the conclusion for most kid shows that I only need to own one dvd of the series and my kids are satisfied!  However, for Yo Gabba I NEED to buy all the DVDs because as well as my kids loving them I really like a lot of the songs too and need to buy the DVDs! Now if only the episode ""Sleep"" was on a DVD!Buy this for any Yo Gabba fan and you will not be dissapointed! Also if you have a kid who LOVES music/dance this is the show for them!!

1232119,A3SYY8KVBFI2C8,B001QU9RRU,kdl,"[0, 0]","My son loves Yo Gabba Gabba so I bought this to add to the collection. Usually you would not find me saying anything but good about this show but there are 2 things I think should be pointed out for potential buyers. One is the episode New Friends stars Jack Black. Don't get me wrong, I love Jack Black. He is funny and I like him in this episode, but it is a deviation from the normal Yo Gabba Gabba show structure to pretty much have the whole episode showing steadily one guest star. This episode is all about Jack Black. If you are not a fan of his, you probably won't like this episode. The other thing I feel should be known is there is a segment where a child says &#34;My name is Juliet. I like to dance.&#34; and she proceeds to dance her dancey dance I guess it is. If I had seen this before purchase I would not have bought this dvd because this little girl is in ill fitting clothes and she gyrates her hips and licks her lips. I am not a prude or a person who reads or sees innuendo where it is not and I am all for kids having fun, dancing, ect, but this particular girl (acting/presented in this manner) in my opinion should NOT be in any kid's movie or show. I was shocked and I had to rewind and watch it again to see if I was just over-reacting. NOPE! I even showed it to a friend who was like what the heck would that be allowed in a kid's show for? I feel sorry for this girl, really and ashamed for her and her parents. If that seems like something that would bother you or you would find inappropriate for your children to watch then you probably don't want to buy this dvd either. I almost hesitated to explain exactly what I thought was questionable because of some creep reading this and buying it just to see that but I know I wish I had known about it. I wish I could just erase that little bit off this dvd. Can the publishers remove this from the dvd? I know you can't from ones already sold but from future ones this should be edited out. I know they have bikinis for little girls and all kinds of stuff and it seems like there are other parents out there who try to keep this kind of thing from their kids (especially the age of kids who watch this show) so I hope this helps you to make a good decision for your family. At least preview the dvd before you let your kids watch it on their own.",3,Starring Jack Black & Questionable Material!,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,2325,"['son', 'Yo', 'Gabba', 'Gabba', 'bought', 'add', 'collection', 'Usually', 'would', 'not', 'find', 'saying', 'anything', 'good', 'show', 'are', '2', 'things', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'potential', 'buyers', 'One', 'episode', 'New', 'Friends', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'Jack', 'Black', 'funny', 'like', 'episode', 'deviation', 'normal', 'Yo', 'Gabba', 'Gabba', 'show', 'structure', 'pretty', 'much', 'have', 'whole', 'episode', 'showing', 'steadily', 'one', 'guest', 'star', 'episode', 'Jack', 'Black', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'episode', 'other', 'thing', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'known', 'segment', 'where', 'child', '34', 'name', 'Juliet', 'like', 'dance.', '34', 'dance', 'dancey', 'dance', 'guess', 'had', 'seen', 'purchase', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'bought', 'dvd', 'little', 'girl', 'ill', 'fitting', 'clothes', 'hips', 'lips', 'am', 'not', 'prude', 'person', 'who', 'innuendo', 'where', 'not', 'am', 'kids', 'having', 'fun', 'dancing', 'ect', 'particular', 'girl', 'acting/presented', 'manner', 'opinion', 'should', 'NOT', 'be', 'kid', 'movie', 'show', 'was', 'shocked', 'had', 'rewind', 'watch', 'again', 'see', 'was', 'just', 'over-reacting', 'NOPE', 'even', 'showed', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'what', 'heck', 'would', 'be', 'allowed', 'kid', 'show', 'feel', 'sorry', 'girl', 'really', 'ashamed', 'parents', 'something', 'would', 'bother', 'would', 'find', 'inappropriate', 'children', 'watch', 'then', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'buy', 'dvd', 'almost', 'hesitated', 'explain', 'exactly', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'questionable', 'creep', 'reading', 'buying', 'just', 'see', 'know', 'wish', 'had', 'known', 'wish', 'could', 'just', 'erase', 'little', 'bit', 'dvd', 'Can', 'publishers', 'remove', 'dvd', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ones', 'already', 'sold', 'future', 'ones', 'should', 'be', 'edited', 'out', 'know', 'have', 'bikinis', 'little', 'girls', 'kinds', 'stuff', 'are', 'other', 'parents', 'who', 'try', 'keep', 'kind', 'thing', 'kids', 'especially', 'age', 'kids', 'who', 'watch', 'show', 'hope', 'make', 'good', 'decision', 'family', 'least', 'preview', 'dvd', 'let', 'kids', 'watch', 'own']",Yo Gabba Gabba!: New Friends
