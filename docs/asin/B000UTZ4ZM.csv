1096308,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B000UTZ4ZM,I. Giles,"[2, 2]","Firstly it is important to correct the video presentation as listed by Amazon. It is not in 4.3 but is presented in very clear 16.9 format throughout.Musically this is an excellent pair of discs and they clearly point up what is missing in the recent Rattle disc with the BPO where I remarked in my review that they deliver an excellent mid European interpretation. What was missing there was the sheer Russian rhythmic drive and melodic flow. In my opinion, there needed to be far more of the raw emotional content in addition to all the expected perfection of the Berliners. Those familiar with the Ashkenazy set of symphonies on CD will know what I mean. Svetlanov also delivers true Russian passion on his CD set too and that is what we get here too with no lack of truly idiomatic Russian passion. The orchestra is fully up to the technical demands of the music and the conductor who, being Russian, perhaps has a natural empathy with the emotional sound world of Rachmaninov.The complete set consists of three performances all of which have been recorded in the Cologne concert hall but without audience. This is a pity as all three performances would surely have got the audience up on its feet! Their loss however and the lack of audience does not in any way lessen the impact of the performances. The symphony is performed in full concert wear within a darkened hall.The Bells and the Symphonic Dances are performed during daylight hours and in 'civilian' clothes - a deliberate informality that does nothing to prevent impassioned and skilful playing. The use of Russian soloists with Russian vocal timbres is an important additional advantage as are the supplied subtitles. There are also two extensive illustrated documentaries making use of extracts from the performances of The Bells for one and The Symphonic Dances for the other to put the music and Rachmaninov in shared context.In my view, what we get here is the real thing recorded in high definition giving excellent surround sound in DD 5.1 as well as stereo coupled with good camera work. Rather a 'must buy' in fact! Highly recommended for compelling and idiomatic performances presented in good modern recordings.",5,Absolutely idiomatic Rachmaninov,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,2188,"['Firstly', 'important', 'correct', 'video', 'presentation', 'listed', 'Amazon', 'not', '4.3', 'presented', 'very', 'clear', '16.9', 'format', 'throughout.Musically', 'excellent', 'pair', 'discs', 'clearly', 'point', 'up', 'what', 'missing', 'recent', 'Rattle', 'disc', 'BPO', 'where', 'remarked', 'review', 'deliver', 'excellent', 'mid', 'European', 'interpretation', 'What', 'was', 'missing', 'there', 'was', 'sheer', 'Russian', 'rhythmic', 'drive', 'melodic', 'flow', 'opinion', 'needed', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'raw', 'emotional', 'content', 'addition', 'expected', 'perfection', 'Berliners', 'familiar', 'Ashkenazy', 'set', 'symphonies', 'CD', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Svetlanov', 'also', 'true', 'Russian', 'passion', 'CD', 'set', 'too', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'too', 'lack', 'truly', 'idiomatic', 'Russian', 'passion', 'orchestra', 'fully', 'up', 'technical', 'demands', 'music', 'conductor', 'who', 'being', 'Russian', 'perhaps', 'natural', 'empathy', 'emotional', 'sound', 'world', 'Rachmaninov.The', 'complete', 'set', 'consists', 'three', 'performances', 'have', 'been', 'recorded', 'Cologne', 'concert', 'hall', 'audience', 'pity', 'three', 'performances', 'would', 'surely', 'have', 'got', 'audience', 'up', 'feet', 'loss', 'however', 'lack', 'audience', 'not', 'way', 'impact', 'performances', 'symphony', 'performed', 'full', 'concert', 'wear', 'darkened', 'hall.The', 'Bells', 'Symphonic', 'Dances', 'are', 'performed', 'daylight', 'hours', ""'civilian"", 'clothes', 'deliberate', 'informality', 'nothing', 'prevent', 'impassioned', 'skilful', 'playing', 'use', 'Russian', 'soloists', 'Russian', 'vocal', 'timbres', 'important', 'additional', 'advantage', 'are', 'supplied', 'subtitles', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'extensive', 'illustrated', 'documentaries', 'making', 'use', 'extracts', 'performances', 'Bells', 'one', 'Symphonic', 'Dances', 'other', 'put', 'music', 'Rachmaninov', 'shared', 'context.In', 'view', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'real', 'thing', 'recorded', 'high', 'definition', 'giving', 'excellent', 'surround', 'sound', 'DD', '5.1', 'as', 'well', 'stereo', 'coupled', 'good', 'camera', 'work', ""'must"", 'buy', 'fact', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'compelling', 'idiomatic', 'performances', 'presented', 'good', 'modern', 'recordings']",N/A
1096309,A28WJ9OIAEEJSI,B000UTZ4ZM,"JakeDee ""Keith Drummond""","[0, 0]","My folks bought me the Sir Adrian Boult recording of the second symphony, with the cuts Sir Adrian took, when I was maybe 10, and I loved it so much that, ever since, I really didn't much care for the recordings I'd heard or performances I'd attended where it was performed uncut.  Too much of a muchness, thought I.  Kind of scandalized my professors when I took the same cuts when I conducted the first movement for a conducting seminar.  (Other than the Requiem and Kyrie from Verdi's Requiem, no more conducting for me, thank God!)  But here, now, with Semyon Bychkov and WDR Orchestra, finally, it all makes sense, especially the extended (to my mind) cor anglais and oboe give-and-take in the 3rd movement leading into one of the best read performances I've ever heard of the climax of that particularly glorious movement.  I suspect it may well take a Russian to understand the immense sense of winter and melancholy this work conveys. (Hope that doesn't sound too sentimental, but before I came to my senses and moved, I lived in a climate very much like that of Holy Mother Russia; trust me, winter and melacholy go together; splendidly, in Rachmaninoff's case, even after he came to America.)I'm nowhere near as familiar with the other pieces on this 2 disc set, but the performances are truly impressive.  As for all the yammer:  It's like commentary tracks on a movie DVD:  If you're interested, fine.  As for me?  Maybe someday when I've got time. . . .Wonderful recording.

While Tchaikovsky's symphonies tend to be greatly melodic- all of them, Rachmanov's tend to be hugely 'emotional'. I just loved this DVD, Semyon Bychkov brings forth the complete emotional content in each of the movements and the WDR Symphony Orchestra plays it marvelously well.My strong recommendation for a 'Must Buy' & 'Must See & Hear'.",5,A good example of the beauty of Rachmaninov's music,1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,455,"['had', 'not', 'heard', 'Semyon', 'Bychkov', 'got', 'see', 'hear', 'DVD-', 'particular', 'Rachmaninov', 'symphony', '2', 'Tchaikovsky', 'symphonies', 'tend', 'be', 'greatly', 'melodic-', 'Rachmanov', 'tend', 'be', 'hugely', ""'emotional"", 'just', 'loved', 'DVD', 'Semyon', 'Bychkov', 'forth', 'complete', 'emotional', 'content', 'movements', 'WDR', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'marvelously', 'strong', 'recommendation', ""'Must"", 'Buy', ""'Must"", 'See', 'Hear']",N/A
1096311,AYPA5IWPKW0OL,B000UTZ4ZM,"moby pablo ""moby""","[1, 2]","""Zeit ist um"" or :""Time is up"". This dvd concerns aging and old age in a special way-the interjections by the conductor and the musicians between the music are not a bad thing- they explain- in a way- a piece that is for - Rachmaninoff- a summing up- altho- aren't ALL of his pieces? in a way? the ""Symphonic Dances"" even more so.It is said that ""The Bells"" was R's favorite works- and such sayings are SO often untrue- yet. in this case- it PROBABLY WAS? and deserves to be.This dvd is a must for Rocky collectors and lovers- conductor Bychov is incisive, he pays attention to detail, and his interpretation way up there- everything you could want. The musicians are fabulous; I am tempted to go off on Rachmaninoff in that I love his stuff so much- but to praise a dvd- that's another matter. This one truly deserves praise.Again we are reminded of that main quality in Rachmaninoff- how ""organic"" he is- how flowing- The music is creepy in a good way- Semyon comments well about old age and this ""summing up"" piece- it is full of foreboding but a beautiful foreboding- one may look no further for advise as to ""how to approach old age""- one of the Cologne musicians (although they seem generally rather humorless) says, ""The older I become, the more I trust my intuition""- the lyrical slow part in the third, the ""twilight"" movement- lugubrious to ecstatic. Suddenly time is up! or Time comes back to haunt you. I notice the homage to Dukas in last movement- the ""Sorcerer's Apprentice""- can you hear the xylophone? but when you see it you know that it's there. The way this dvd breaks up the ""Dances"" with the commentary is somehow not obtrusive, but helpful- the way conductors will come out and talk about a piece before or after- at least conductors Marin Alsop and David Zinman before her do here in Baltimore.the 3rd movement- the ""Wedding Bells""- is there a more positive piece in music (outside of Bach- all of Bach or much) maybe in Ravel",5,superlative,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,1950,"['Zeit', 'ist', 'um', 'Time', 'up', 'dvd', 'concerns', 'aging', 'old', 'age', 'special', 'way-the', 'interjections', 'conductor', 'musicians', 'music', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'thing-', 'explain-', 'way-', 'piece', 'Rachmaninoff-', 'summing', 'up-', 'altho-', 'are', ""n't"", 'ALL', 'pieces', 'way', 'Symphonic', 'Dances', 'even', 'more', 'so.It', 'said', 'Bells', 'was', 'R', 'favorite', 'works-', 'such', 'sayings', 'are', 'SO', 'often', 'untrue-', 'yet', 'case-', 'PROBABLY', 'WAS', 'be.This', 'dvd', 'must', 'Rocky', 'collectors', 'lovers-', 'conductor', 'Bychov', 'incisive', 'attention', 'detail', 'interpretation', 'way', 'there-', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'musicians', 'are', 'fabulous', 'am', 'tempted', 'go', 'off', 'Rachmaninoff', 'love', 'stuff', 'so', 'much-', 'praise', 'dvd-', 'matter', 'one', 'truly', 'are', 'reminded', 'main', 'quality', 'Rachmaninoff-', 'how', 'organic', 'is-', 'how', 'flowing-', 'music', 'creepy', 'good', 'way-', 'Semyon', 'comments', 'well', 'old', 'age', 'summing', 'up', 'piece-', 'full', 'foreboding', 'beautiful', 'foreboding-', 'one', 'may', 'look', 'further', 'advise', 'how', 'approach', 'old', 'age', 'one', 'Cologne', 'musicians', 'seem', 'generally', 'rather', 'humorless', 'older', 'become', 'more', 'trust', 'intuition', 'lyrical', 'slow', 'part', 'third', 'twilight', 'movement-', 'lugubrious', 'ecstatic', 'Suddenly', 'time', 'up', 'Time', 'back', 'haunt', 'notice', 'homage', 'Dukas', 'last', 'movement-', 'Sorcerer', 'Apprentice', 'can', 'hear', 'xylophone', 'when', 'see', 'know', 'there', 'way', 'dvd', 'up', 'Dances', 'commentary', 'somehow', 'not', 'obtrusive', 'way', 'conductors', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'talk', 'piece', 'after-', 'least', 'conductors', 'Marin', 'Alsop', 'David', 'Zinman', 'do', 'here', 'Baltimore.the', '3rd', 'movement-', 'Wedding', 'Bells', 'more', 'positive', 'piece', 'music', 'Bach-', 'Bach', 'much', 'maybe', 'Ravel']",N/A

This really was a motley looking group in t-shirts, jeans, unshaven and most of the time in a rehearsal hall perhaps in a college or high school. This group could have dressed up for the performance and presented it in a real concert hall. Certainly there is one in Cologne. Looks however, are deceiving. They are a superb orchestra and Semyon is an impassioned conductor though difficult to watch with his mannerisms and dressing like a slob.  The picture quality and sound is excellent.....but since this was probably a shoot of a rehearsal I am not sure a DVD is necessary.
