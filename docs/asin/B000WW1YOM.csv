For those who don't know, Holiday Hi-Jynx was banned after it's first or second American airing. The pokemon jynx was considered racist by a Carole Boston Weatherford, a concerned parent, and after seeing the episode contacted 4kids about it. They removed the episode from syndication promptly, and Nintendo recolored jynx in later incarnations to be purple. Her origional black skin and big red lips seemed to be depicting african americans in a racist fashion popular in the 1930s and 40s.When I saw that it was on the box set, I wondered if it was the rumored edited version where jynx was purple. I was really happy to see that it was the origional american broadcast version. It would be nice if the set was uncut with origional dialog, but it could have been worse.
