1436645,A1DRKVXO300RUE,B0051MKMLY,Amazon Customer,"[3, 4]","Its almost a stretch to rate this movie average.  More than half of the film is completely meaningless and provides no action, horror or other elements that advance the story/plot.  Then, when we actually get to the potentially meaty part, the story is highly disjointed, with numerous disparate elements that don't really work together.  Eventually, and despite what the official description says, the actual heart of this movie starts as a group of locked up (in an asylum) criminally insane psychos get the benefit of a security system breach, break out of their cells, and then try to kill each other and the staff.  Its at this point, which unfortunately doesn't start until at least 2/3, if not 3/4 into the movie, that it becomes somewhat fun and worthwhile.  Granted there is very little original content, and the acting is at best, lifetime quality, but there's a surprising level of fun and creative costumes/concepts that makes worthwhile.  Had the entire movie displayed the same level of energy and creativity as the last segment, I'd give the film a higher ranking, but the ending makes this a high quality rental for sure.",3,"average, but a few fun parts",1313625600,"08 18, 2011",2011,1137,"['almost', 'stretch', 'rate', 'movie', 'average', 'More', 'half', 'film', 'completely', 'meaningless', 'action', 'horror', 'other', 'elements', 'advance', 'story/plot', 'Then', 'when', 'actually', 'get', 'potentially', 'meaty', 'part', 'story', 'highly', 'disjointed', 'numerous', 'disparate', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'together', 'Eventually', 'what', 'official', 'description', 'actual', 'heart', 'movie', 'group', 'locked', 'up', 'asylum', 'criminally', 'insane', 'psychos', 'get', 'benefit', 'security', 'system', 'breach', 'break', 'cells', 'then', 'try', 'kill', 'other', 'staff', 'point', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'start', 'least', '2/3', 'not', '3/4', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'fun', 'worthwhile', 'Granted', 'very', 'little', 'original', 'content', 'acting', 'best', 'lifetime', 'quality', 'surprising', 'level', 'fun', 'creative', 'costumes/concepts', 'worthwhile', 'Had', 'entire', 'movie', 'displayed', 'same', 'level', 'energy', 'creativity', 'last', 'segment', ""'d"", 'give', 'film', 'higher', 'ranking', 'ending', 'high', 'quality', 'rental', 'sure']",Medium Raw

1436648,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,B0051MKMLY,Carlisle Wheeling,"[0, 0]","I watched this yesterday, and have to say that as I become more accustomed to the genre of horror, this movie will definitely not do.  The storyline is weak, the dialog is mostly laughable, and the majority of the acting is on par with a Chiller movie, and Chiller movies are far more rancid smelling than most of the movies run on Lifetime.  This movie isn't horror by any means, so look for it on cable soon.  If it had been a dark comedy I would have liked it better because the woman who played the cannibal, Mabel, was funny in the kitchen scene and it was one of the few bright spots in the entire waste of 90 minutes.  The other notable character, as another reviewer pointed out, was the maniac with the toe fetish.  Both the little girls in this movie were annoying, but the one who played the cop's dead sister was the worst.  You feel no sympathy for any of the victims, and one of the characters working in the asylum is such a creep, you begin to suspect something isn't right about them either and you're proven correct.  If you want to waste your time with this twee excuse of a thriller/horror movie, maybe you will also like the equally putrid Playing House.  You can have a two-for-one stinkfest.

1436649,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B0051MKMLY,Einsatz,"[3, 4]","My mistake, I saw the name John Rhys-Davies on the cover of this DVD and naturally assumed that was a guarantee of the quality involved.  WRONG!  Instead, I should have taken note of another name, Andrew Cymek: writer, director, editor, AND catatonic star of this madness.  The man was almost life-like in his portrayal of a cop out to trap a `wolf'.  The second ""name"" star was William B. Davis (cigarette man on The X-Files).  He looked very old and feeble under the harsh and unforgiving light, I almost felt sorry for him.  Only desperation could explain accepting a role in something like this.Most of the action takes place in a loony bin/sanitarium/nut house/asylum that would hardly pass inspection in any known universe or time period.  To say it was grimy is to diminish the full horror of its shabby interior.  There isn't enough anti-bacterial hand sanitizer in the world to stave off the germs one would get just standing in any of its dimly lit corridors!  No wonder their staff was rife with idiots, who but a crazy person would set foot in that mausoleum.As for the poorly plodding plot, it takes forever to get to any amount of action but when it does it's too little too late and assailed by a load of misfired jokes.  Was this a comedy or a horror movie?  It didn't work on either level.  It didn't work at all.

1436650,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0051MKMLY,Michael Butts,"[3, 4]","Set in an asylum for the criminally insane, MEDIUM RAW is a dark, sometime humorous, foray into madness.  The plot centers on The Wolf, a notorious serial killer responsible for the murders of 14 young girls.  One of the victim's brother is the cop who finally captures The Wolf.  The Wolf ends up in the asylum and on Christmas Eve, a power outage results in the release of all the inmates who go on a murderous rampage.Cop Johnny is played by Andrew Czymek, who also wrote the screenplay and directed.  His performance is wooden and bland, sabotaging the film's effectiveness.  Equally abyssmal is Brigitte Kingsley, who also produced, as the doctor who is also Johnny's bosomy estranged wife.  Kingsley shows no emotional range and is often pathetically inept.  X-FILE's Cigarette Man (William B. Davis) is mostly effective as the asylum director who is quite sinister.  The best performances, however, come from the actors who play Mabel, the crazed cannibal and Oliver, the naked foot fetishist.  Mabel's cooking lesson on how to prepare a human souffle is quite funny.MEDIUM RAW is occasionally involving but its plot twist is fairly obvious.  The Wolf costume is creepy and unique.

It's saved from being complete crap thanks to one excellent character, but I'm not sure that pushed it over the line from ""don't bother"" to ""watch this.""Plot: A number of civilians, through various rather silly excuses, find themselves inside a dark, windowless, nasty asylum after dark, as do some of the staff. A power outage coupled with a computer failure lead to the inmates being released from their cells, forcing the sane folks to try and find ways to survive until help arrives.Simple yes, and also predictable, as well as being overall badly-acted. The direction is competent, if barely so, and the script (written by Cymek) is nothing special, with a single exception: Mabel (The Rocker's Sandi Ross), a serial killer/cannibal who wants to be your best friend, right up until she eats your eyeballs. Mabel's a fantastic character, easily the best-drawn in the movie; given the characters surrounding her, this would seem to be a case of ""even a stopped clock is right twice a day.""
