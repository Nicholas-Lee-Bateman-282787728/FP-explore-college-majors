The film is based on a true life story of a young policewoman in Texas in the late 70's, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, who gets recruited by narcotics officer, Jason Patric, to be his partner in a sting operation.  Their superior is played by the always superb Sam Elliot. The partners must infiltrate the local drug scene in order to bring down a suspected drug lord, (Gregg Allman). Leigh realizes she may be over her head as she starts to fall for Patric and is slowly drawn into the dark side of being a narcotics agent.  Jason Patric has already been enveloped by the drug scene and the two try to help each other get clean and finish the literally impossible job of apprehending Allman using whatever measures possible, no matter how unethical and dangerous they may be. The performances by Leigh and Patric are intense and thoroughly believable. The soundtrack performed by Eric Clapton is excellent and the song ""Tears in Heaven"" was nominated for a Golden Globe.",4,True and well acted film about undercover narcotics,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,1094,"['rewatched', 'film', 'found', 'just', 'suspenseful', 'authentic', 'when', 'originally', 'saw', 'almost', '20', 'yrs', 'ago', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'young', 'policewoman', 'Texas', 'late', '70', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'who', 'recruited', 'narcotics', 'officer', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'be', 'partner', 'sting', 'operation', 'superior', 'played', 'always', 'superb', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'partners', 'must', 'infiltrate', 'local', 'drug', 'scene', 'order', 'bring', 'down', 'suspected', 'drug', 'lord', 'Gregg', 'Allman', 'Leigh', 'may', 'be', 'head', 'fall', 'Patric', 'slowly', 'drawn', 'dark', 'side', 'being', 'narcotics', 'agent', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'already', 'been', 'enveloped', 'drug', 'scene', 'two', 'try', 'help', 'other', 'get', 'clean', 'finish', 'literally', 'impossible', 'job', 'apprehending', 'Allman', 'using', 'measures', 'possible', 'matter', 'how', 'unethical', 'dangerous', 'may', 'be', 'performances', 'Leigh', 'Patric', 'are', 'intense', 'thoroughly', 'believable', 'soundtrack', 'performed', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'excellent', 'song', 'Tears', 'Heaven', 'was', 'nominated', 'Golden', 'Globe']",N/A

Allman does a servicable job as the local bar owner/drug dealer, but he has virtually no dialogue. Nonetheless, his presence is menacing enough to pull off the desired effect. Jason Patric is the unquestioned star of Rush. He turns in a career making performance as a ""seasoned"" narcotics officer who makes his living going undercover. Jennifer Jason Leigh is the straight-laced partner he is given to help bring down Allman. Needless to say, Patric is good at his job, almost too good and there's a reason. His partner soon finds out the real deal and also becomes romantically involved with him. Begin the downward spiral into heroin addiction...The film lags a bit at times but Patric's edgy performance is enough to get you to the eventual climax. The ending seems like it was studio mandated which is a shame because the film itself stands on it's own up to the last scene.

Greg Allman owns the bars in town and seemingly everyone wants to get high.  Guys on Harleys are even sharing a joint in front of one of Allman's establishments near the beginning.  Patric is an undercover agent from Montana with Leigh being the new recruit who wants to ""make a difference"".  Sam Elliot supplies them with cash to buy drugs.

Patric and Leigh find out they're more like the people they're going to bust than the ones they're working for. Still, this is a good movie.  Jennifer Leigh does some great acting.

It's the true first-person story of a female police officer in Texas who went undercover to catch drug dealers and eventually became addicted to drugs herself.  I thought the book was good.  This 1991 film is a remake of that story and stars Jennifer Jason Leigh..The storyline shows the young idealistic cop being slowly convinced by her partner, Jason Patric, that they would have to do drugs in order to make drug dealers trust them.  Eventually, she and Patric not only become seriously addicted, they also get involved in a romance.  The viewer knows that no good will come of this.  The viewer is right.The roles are difficult but the actors did their jobs well.  I really believed they were addicted and felt sorry for their predicament.  Their commanding officer, Sam Elliott, knew what was going on but looked the other way because they kept making arrests.  And their world was so infested with drugs that it became impossible to resist.Because I had read the book, I knew how the story would turn out and this made the film seem a little slow. It could have been edited better.  But generally, I enjoyed the film, felt totally turned off by the world it depicted, and feel that justice was done.

320066,ABE8YHLYSM15G,6302555213,Luke Killion,"[4, 4]","""Rush"" is a 1991 production directed by Lili Zanuck. This movie is an incredible tale of corruption based on an undercover drug sting in 1974 and early 1975. The first time I saw this flick, I did not know that it and the book it was based upon are derived from a true crime scandal in Tyler, Texas. The author of the original book, Kim Wozencraft was in fact an undercover police officer, so in a way her story is a tell all, but told through a fictitious format. I have not read the book, but this story ranks as one of the best examples of what undercover narcotics officers endure, especially in an age when there was no DNA or electronic surveillance. Making a case against a big time gangster could be close to impossible back in the day; this movie is a prime example of how frustration at this powerlessness led to some poor decisions in order to prosecute mobsters who knew how to beat the system.As far as gangster movies go, this one is perhaps one of the best examples of the so called ""Dixie mafia."" Even though it is told entirely from the perspective of the law, the presence of the ""bad guy"", Will Gaines is felt strongly throughout the entire movie. Gaines is played flawlessly by rock star Gregg Allman. I am currently reading Allman's newly published memoir, ""My Cross to Bear"", which led me to revisit this film. Allman's performance is almost entirely non verbal; his screen presence is enigmatic as he combines rock star swagger with the steely eyed gaze of an untouchable gangster. It is amazing because he has so few lines (maybe 5 or ten), but his charisma carries this character. For someone who had little to no acting experience, you couldn't cast a better actor. In his memoir, he said ""it was more of an attitude thing"". He was clearly familiar with the Gaines type through his extensive career in the Allman Brothers Band.  His  memoir talks a lot about drug use (which is obviously the central aspect of ""Rush""), but the Gaines character was more of a pusher than an addict. Never the less, Allman did have a run with the Dixie mafia in the mid 70's; he received death threats after he was subpoenaed to testify against his drug suppliers. Allman's grasp of this world is complete. I would even venture to say his machismo in this role is something like a Southern Brando. It is really that good.Though Gaines is the mysterious drug lord/porn king in this movie, the main characters are two narcs played by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jason Patric. Leigh is the still green rookie who gets in over her head, while Patric is the experienced street wise junky/dealer. Their professional relationship turns romantic, and in a way they have their lives in their partner's hands. They attempt buy bust their way up the drug ring, but encounter a lot of difficulty, both through the consumption of every type of narcotics, as well as suspicious dealers. The most memorable one other than Gaines is ""Willie Red"", played with creepy style by Special K McCray, who forces them to shoot up with his pre prepared dose. Sam Elliot also has a role as Captain Dodd, their handler at Katterly, Texas Police Department. This is crime drama at its most hard hitting, and also gives a great example of southern gangs as well as the 1970's drug scene.",5,1970's Texas narc drama,1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,3261,"['Rush', '1991', 'production', 'directed', 'Lili', 'Zanuck', 'movie', 'incredible', 'tale', 'corruption', 'based', 'undercover', 'drug', 'sting', '1974', 'early', '1975', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'flick', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'are', 'derived', 'true', 'crime', 'scandal', 'Tyler', 'Texas', 'author', 'original', 'book', 'Kim', 'Wozencraft', 'was', 'fact', 'undercover', 'police', 'officer', 'so', 'way', 'story', 'tell', 'all', 'told', 'fictitious', 'format', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'story', 'one', 'best', 'examples', 'what', 'undercover', 'narcotics', 'officers', 'endure', 'especially', 'age', 'when', 'was', 'DNA', 'electronic', 'surveillance', 'Making', 'case', 'big', 'time', 'gangster', 'could', 'be', 'close', 'impossible', 'back', 'day', 'movie', 'prime', 'example', 'how', 'frustration', 'powerlessness', 'led', 'poor', 'decisions', 'order', 'prosecute', 'mobsters', 'who', 'knew', 'how', 'beat', 'system.As', 'far', 'gangster', 'movies', 'go', 'one', 'perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'examples', 'so', 'called', 'Dixie', 'mafia', 'Even', 'told', 'entirely', 'perspective', 'law', 'presence', 'bad', 'guy', 'Will', 'Gaines', 'felt', 'strongly', 'entire', 'movie', 'Gaines', 'played', 'flawlessly', 'rock', 'star', 'Gregg', 'Allman', 'am', 'currently', 'reading', 'Allman', 'newly', 'published', 'memoir', 'Cross', 'Bear', 'led', 'revisit', 'film', 'Allman', 'performance', 'almost', 'entirely', 'non', 'verbal', 'screen', 'presence', 'enigmatic', 'rock', 'star', 'swagger', 'steely', 'eyed', 'gaze', 'untouchable', 'gangster', 'amazing', 'so', 'few', 'lines', 'maybe', '5', 'ten', 'charisma', 'character', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'little', 'acting', 'experience', 'could', ""n't"", 'cast', 'better', 'actor', 'memoir', 'said', 'was', 'more', 'attitude', 'thing', 'was', 'clearly', 'familiar', 'Gaines', 'type', 'extensive', 'career', 'Allman', 'Brothers', 'Band', 'memoir', 'lot', 'drug', 'use', 'obviously', 'central', 'aspect', 'Rush', 'Gaines', 'character', 'was', 'more', 'pusher', 'addict', 'less', 'Allman', 'did', 'have', 'run', 'Dixie', 'mafia', 'mid', '70', 'received', 'death', 'threats', 'was', 'subpoenaed', 'testify', 'drug', 'suppliers', 'Allman', 'grasp', 'world', 'complete', 'would', 'even', 'venture', 'say', 'machismo', 'role', 'something', 'Southern', 'Brando', 'really', 'good.Though', 'Gaines', 'mysterious', 'drug', 'lord/porn', 'king', 'movie', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'two', 'narcs', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'Leigh', 'still', 'green', 'rookie', 'who', 'head', 'Patric', 'experienced', 'street', 'wise', 'junky/dealer', 'professional', 'relationship', 'romantic', 'way', 'have', 'lives', 'partner', 'hands', 'attempt', 'buy', 'bust', 'way', 'drug', 'ring', 'encounter', 'lot', 'difficulty', 'consumption', 'type', 'narcotics', 'as', 'well', 'suspicious', 'dealers', 'most', 'memorable', 'one', 'other', 'Gaines', 'Willie', 'Red', 'played', 'creepy', 'style', 'Special', 'K', 'McCray', 'who', 'shoot', 'up', 'pre', 'prepared', 'dose', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'also', 'role', 'Captain', 'Dodd', 'handler', 'Katterly', 'Texas', 'Police', 'Department', 'crime', 'drama', 'most', 'hard', 'hitting', 'also', 'great', 'example', 'southern', 'gangs', 'as', 'well', '1970', 'drug', 'scene']",N/A

320074,A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ,6302555213,Todd7,"[2, 2]","This movie features two very underrated actors (Jennifer Jason Leigh & Jason Patric)who give stellar performances. Also making an appearance is Gregg Allman, whose role is of a drug lord who the undercover cops (Leigh & Patric) are trying to nail, but can't seem to come up with anything concrete. Meanwhile, they become addicted to drugs while trying to blend in with the drug culture while trying to carry out their mission as cops. All of the physical evidence they collect winds up being consumed. In the end, Leigh's integrity as a person ultimately frees Allman, who can't believe that Leigh didn't try to alter evidence, etc. This movie gives a realistic account of 70's life in the south in the face of adversity. The suspense and drama builds throughout the movie, as a number of people lose their internal battles, and succumb to their demons. This is a good movie that's off the beaten path of usual dramas, and certainly kept my attention throughout. I recommend this movie, and the soundtrack, too. 8/10",4,"""Make the Case""",1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,1016,"['movie', 'two', 'very', 'underrated', 'actors', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'who', 'give', 'stellar', 'performances', 'Also', 'making', 'appearance', 'Gregg', 'Allman', 'role', 'drug', 'lord', 'who', 'undercover', 'cops', 'Leigh', 'Patric', 'are', 'trying', 'nail', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'concrete', 'Meanwhile', 'become', 'addicted', 'drugs', 'trying', 'blend', 'drug', 'culture', 'trying', 'carry', 'out', 'mission', 'cops', 'physical', 'evidence', 'collect', 'up', 'being', 'consumed', 'end', 'Leigh', 'integrity', 'person', 'ultimately', 'Allman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Leigh', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'alter', 'evidence', 'etc', 'movie', 'realistic', 'account', '70', 'life', 'south', 'face', 'adversity', 'suspense', 'drama', 'builds', 'movie', 'number', 'people', 'lose', 'internal', 'battles', 'succumb', 'demons', 'good', 'movie', 'beaten', 'path', 'usual', 'dramas', 'certainly', 'kept', 'attention', 'recommend', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'too', '8/10']",N/A
