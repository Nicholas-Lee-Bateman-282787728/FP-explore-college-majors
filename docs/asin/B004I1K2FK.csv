1410365,ABNPNMB2U63O0,B004I1K2FK,B Leuri,"[5, 8]","Adventure Inc - its a sort of microcosm of Raiders of the Lost Ark meets James Bond, just without [for the most part] the really nice toys.The storylines were predictable, there was no stunning surprise in any episode, however even in spite of that its far from a total loss, most individual episodes were thoroughly enjoyable.The series focuses around salvage expeditions which take place in interesting destinations varying from the Caribbean to the Med, even rural England, all of which are worth watching even if it's simply for the scenery.The series would probably keep young teens far more entertained than maturer adults, for me it was almost like the ""A Team"" doing archeological salvage, I just didn't see how that many bullets could consistently miss the ""good guys"".In the end three stars because although it was fairly predictable it was far from completely boring, the sets were not B quality, the locations were often excellent. In fact the locations got a solid 5 stars. Many of the scenes presented highlighted natural beauty that was quite breathtaking.It fell down in several of the episode storylines, some of the acting quality, and the obscurity of some of the so very obviously invented ""artifacts"" they were chasing.From a very personal perspective a much better value, and in the same vein, was the series starring Tia Carrere produced in Canada, where she played the role of Sydney Fox in Relic Hunter.",3,Predictable brain salad.,1311292800,"07 22, 2011",2011,1428,"['Adventure', 'Inc', 'sort', 'microcosm', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'James', 'Bond', 'just', '[', 'most', 'part', 'really', 'nice', 'toys.The', 'storylines', 'were', 'predictable', 'was', 'stunning', 'surprise', 'episode', 'however', 'even', 'spite', 'far', 'total', 'loss', 'most', 'individual', 'episodes', 'were', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable.The', 'series', 'salvage', 'expeditions', 'take', 'place', 'interesting', 'destinations', 'varying', 'Caribbean', 'Med', 'even', 'rural', 'England', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'simply', 'scenery.The', 'series', 'would', 'probably', 'keep', 'young', 'teens', 'far', 'more', 'entertained', 'maturer', 'adults', 'was', 'almost', 'Team', 'doing', 'archeological', 'salvage', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'many', 'bullets', 'could', 'consistently', 'miss', 'good', 'guys', '.In', 'end', 'three', 'stars', 'was', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'was', 'far', 'completely', 'boring', 'sets', 'were', 'not', 'B', 'quality', 'locations', 'were', 'often', 'excellent', 'fact', 'locations', 'got', 'solid', '5', 'stars', 'Many', 'scenes', 'presented', 'highlighted', 'natural', 'beauty', 'was', 'quite', 'breathtaking.It', 'fell', 'down', 'several', 'episode', 'storylines', 'acting', 'quality', 'obscurity', 'so', 'very', 'obviously', 'invented', 'artifacts', 'were', 'chasing.From', 'very', 'personal', 'perspective', 'much', 'better', 'value', 'same', 'vein', 'was', 'series', 'starring', 'Tia', 'Carrere', 'produced', 'Canada', 'where', 'played', 'role', 'Sydney', 'Fox', 'Relic', 'Hunter']",Adventure Inc. - The Complete Series

1410368,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B004I1K2FK,MadMacs,"[3, 4]","Now, originally, I had written a review that raked this program across hot coals.Having taken time to screen the premiere episode - to say it was a disappointment would've been a serious understatement. Ripped everything and everyone associated with the show, including an actor whom I respect and generally enjoy - Michael Biehn. Ultimately giving it a single star.But the weird part was, in an effort to be fair, I decided to watch several more of the 22 episodes that make up the single season of its existence.Well, surprisingly, this sort of - very slightly - grew on me.Okay, I'm not saying this was a sleeper hit that fell to the mercurial and usually moronic axe of the typical Ivy-League schooled icehole. No, it's abundantly clear that this was never going to become a mainstay in the television landscape. But that's not to say that it didn't have a certain spoof-ish comedic charm.And it's from that perspective that I began to view 'Adventure Inc' in the same vein as watching The Simpsons - an accepted unreality; a skewed lampoon of the real world. Essentially a comic book with living characters.Unfortunately, miscasts abound.What didn't change - Biehns' two exceptionally mediocre sidekicks.The gun-toting babe of the team played by, and this is not a typo, Karen Cliche. An actress who couldn't have had a more appropriate surname. Just about everything about her was just that - clich&eacute;d. Besides the obvious plastic enhancements, even her sweat looked fake. Despite being some decent eye-candy, she was a marginal performer whose uneven talent hindered the program.And computer geek, Jesse Nilsson, wasn't nearly geeky enough; nor funny enough to carry his simple one-dimensional role. You're a geek - be a flipping geek. Throw out some complex math, input some programming lingo, hack a computer, do something - anything - but stand around tossing out half-assed smarmy lines.The stories were shamelessly derivative to the point of unintended satire; the writing wooden and shallow; the direction unexceptionally linear.Yet, it did grow on me. Slightly. And only if you're in the right mood.Call it two-and-a-half stars. But since Amazon doesn't have half stars...dos estrellas it is.Program Note:I do appreciate that Roger Corman was the unseen hand guiding executive producer, Gale Anne Hurd, through the world of doing things on the cheap. But he wasn't involved enough. Without his clean editing and sharp direction, the show bogged down and bungled itself.Interestingly, Ms. Hurd would eventually find small screen success. It took nearly a full decade getting the right combination of actors, story and budget. You might've heard of this cable show: ""The Walking Dead"".",2,Has A Certain Spoof-ish Charm,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,2703,"['Now', 'originally', 'had', 'written', 'review', 'raked', 'program', 'hot', 'coals.Having', 'taken', 'time', 'screen', 'premiere', 'episode', 'say', 'was', 'disappointment', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'serious', 'understatement', 'Ripped', 'everything', 'everyone', 'associated', 'show', 'including', 'actor', 'whom', 'respect', 'generally', 'enjoy', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'Ultimately', 'giving', 'single', 'star.But', 'weird', 'part', 'was', 'effort', 'be', 'fair', 'decided', 'watch', 'several', 'more', '22', 'episodes', 'make', 'up', 'single', 'season', 'existence.Well', 'surprisingly', 'sort', 'very', 'slightly', 'grew', 'me.Okay', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'was', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'fell', 'mercurial', 'usually', 'moronic', 'axe', 'typical', 'Ivy-League', 'schooled', 'icehole', 'No', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'become', 'mainstay', 'television', 'landscape', 'not', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'certain', 'spoof-ish', 'comedic', 'charm.And', 'perspective', 'began', 'view', ""'Adventure"", 'Inc', 'same', 'vein', 'watching', 'Simpsons', 'accepted', 'unreality', 'skewed', 'lampoon', 'real', 'world', 'Essentially', 'comic', 'book', 'living', 'characters.Unfortunately', 'miscasts', 'abound.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'Biehns', 'two', 'exceptionally', 'mediocre', 'sidekicks.The', 'gun-toting', 'babe', 'team', 'played', 'not', 'typo', 'Karen', 'Cliche', 'actress', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'more', 'appropriate', 'surname', 'Just', 'everything', 'was', 'just', 'clich', 'eacute', 'obvious', 'plastic', 'enhancements', 'even', 'sweat', 'looked', 'fake', 'being', 'decent', 'eye-candy', 'was', 'marginal', 'performer', 'uneven', 'talent', 'hindered', 'program.And', 'computer', 'geek', 'Jesse', 'Nilsson', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'geeky', 'enough', 'funny', 'enough', 'carry', 'simple', 'one-dimensional', 'role', ""'re"", 'geek', 'be', 'flipping', 'geek', 'Throw', 'out', 'complex', 'math', 'input', 'programming', 'lingo', 'hack', 'computer', 'do', 'something', 'anything', 'stand', 'tossing', 'out', 'half-assed', 'smarmy', 'lines.The', 'stories', 'were', 'shamelessly', 'derivative', 'point', 'unintended', 'satire', 'writing', 'wooden', 'shallow', 'direction', 'unexceptionally', 'linear.Yet', 'did', 'grow', 'Slightly', 'only', ""'re"", 'right', 'mood.Call', 'two-and-a-half', 'stars', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'have', 'half', 'stars', 'is.Program', 'Note', 'do', 'appreciate', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'was', 'unseen', 'hand', 'guiding', 'executive', 'producer', 'Gale', 'Anne', 'Hurd', 'world', 'doing', 'things', 'cheap', 'was', ""n't"", 'involved', 'enough', 'clean', 'editing', 'sharp', 'direction', 'show', 'bogged', 'down', 'bungled', 'itself.Interestingly', 'Ms.', 'Hurd', 'would', 'eventually', 'find', 'small', 'screen', 'success', 'took', 'nearly', 'full', 'decade', 'getting', 'right', 'combination', 'actors', 'story', 'budget', 'might', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'cable', 'show', 'Walking', 'Dead']",Adventure Inc. - The Complete Series

1410370,AFV2584U13XP3,B004I1K2FK,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[16, 17]","While I saw the series when it first aired almost a decade ago what really renewed my thirst to re-watch the show was my interest in adventure games like Tomb Raider and Uncharted and while it does have the campy like acting in a lot of it's episodes similar to a lot of other series at that time Hercules/Xena/Sinbad etc etc all in all the show wasn't to bad for what it was and for the three actors/actress of the main characters they played their roles pretty well.  The basic premise is you have a group of treasure hunters searching the globe looking for lost historical and mythological artifacts(ALA Indiana Jones) and fight the bad guys are help people along the way.  The effects were the standard so-so kind again with series at that time so if you're expecting the more digitized effects we've grown used to these last six years or so you'll be disappointed, but like with another entertaining series Tales of the Golden Monkey a lot of the story and characters do make up for the lack of great effects for the most part.  Someone asked about the video quality of the set an I have to say I was amazed at how clear and pristine the quality actually was, while you might expect some graininess there actually wasn't and the clarity was actually equal to some of today's sets like CSI:Las Vegas or Burn Notice which is very appreciated. So for an enjoyable adventure series here's a decent one to check out but keep the expectations in the middle as while it's not a bad series it's not going to be a great one either just an enjoyable one like with the other series at its time Hercules Xena and other syndicated series that were playing around this time...",5,Campy But Still Enjoyable Adventure Series To Watch,1325721600,"01 5, 2012",2012,1667,"['saw', 'series', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'almost', 'decade', 'what', 'really', 'renewed', 'thirst', 're-watch', 'show', 'was', 'interest', 'adventure', 'games', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'Uncharted', 'have', 'campy', 'acting', 'lot', 'episodes', 'similar', 'lot', 'other', 'series', 'time', 'Hercules/Xena/Sinbad', 'etc', 'etc', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'what', 'was', 'three', 'actors/actress', 'main', 'characters', 'played', 'roles', 'pretty', 'well', 'basic', 'premise', 'have', 'group', 'treasure', 'hunters', 'searching', 'globe', 'looking', 'lost', 'historical', 'mythological', 'artifacts', 'ALA', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'fight', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'help', 'people', 'way', 'effects', 'were', 'standard', 'so-so', 'kind', 'again', 'series', 'time', 'so', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'more', 'digitized', 'effects', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'used', 'last', 'six', 'years', 'so', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'entertaining', 'series', 'Tales', 'Golden', 'Monkey', 'lot', 'story', 'characters', 'do', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'great', 'effects', 'most', 'part', 'Someone', 'asked', 'video', 'quality', 'set', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'clear', 'pristine', 'quality', 'actually', 'was', 'might', 'expect', 'graininess', 'actually', 'was', ""n't"", 'clarity', 'was', 'actually', 'equal', 'today', 'sets', 'CSI', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Burn', 'Notice', 'very', 'appreciated', 'So', 'enjoyable', 'adventure', 'series', 'here', 'decent', 'one', 'check', 'out', 'keep', 'expectations', 'middle', 'not', 'bad', 'series', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'one', 'just', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'other', 'series', 'time', 'Hercules', 'Xena', 'other', 'syndicated', 'series', 'were', 'playing', 'time']",Adventure Inc. - The Complete Series
