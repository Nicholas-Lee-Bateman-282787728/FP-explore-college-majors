402275,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6304111835,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 6]","I remember this film quite clearly when I was in high school. At the time, I found it fantastic that I could watch a book without worrying about the doldrums of actually reading it.  Looking back on it now, I remember a feeling of fantasy and imagination. I could only wonder what was running through Swift's mind as he wrote this symbolic story. Watching it again, older ... wiser ... and more inept to read instead of watch, I thought it was still a wonderful story. There were flaws, as there is with any made-for-TV film, but they seemed smaller then some of the big budget films that I have witnessed lately. I think that the fact that Henson's son had his hands in this allowed the creativity to leap from the screen.The biggest aspect of this film that I enjoyed was the satire on society. In every place that Gulliver travels he either imposes his society on others or they impose on him. There are times when they try to co-exist, but it ultimately fails in the end. Overall, the film is very well done indeed, with perfect art design, costuming and atmospheric direction by Sturridge- the Glubbdubdrib section is brilliantly eerie. Ted Danson is nothing short of fantastic, in a studied yet emotional performance. He has trouble with the English accent at times, but the effects and ensemble acting overshadow it. Steenbergen is less memorable, but still effective. The star-studded supporting cast impresses throughout, especially to O'Toole's Lilliputian Emperor and Nicholas Lyndhurst's Clustril. The music is near perfect as well.Overall, a decent outing by everyone involved and worth viewing again for those that may be hesitant to read the books.Grade: *** out of *****",3,"Well, you weren't exaggerating... he's a whopper!",1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,1686,"['remember', 'film', 'quite', 'clearly', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'time', 'found', 'fantastic', 'could', 'watch', 'book', 'worrying', 'doldrums', 'actually', 'reading', 'Looking', 'back', 'now', 'remember', 'feeling', 'fantasy', 'imagination', 'could', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'was', 'running', 'Swift', 'mind', 'wrote', 'symbolic', 'story', 'Watching', 'again', 'older', 'wiser', 'more', 'inept', 'read', 'instead', 'watch', 'thought', 'was', 'still', 'wonderful', 'story', 'were', 'flaws', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'seemed', 'smaller', 'then', 'big', 'budget', 'films', 'have', 'witnessed', 'lately', 'think', 'fact', 'Henson', 'son', 'had', 'hands', 'allowed', 'creativity', 'leap', 'screen.The', 'biggest', 'aspect', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'satire', 'society', 'place', 'Gulliver', 'society', 'others', 'impose', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'try', 'co-exist', 'ultimately', 'end', 'Overall', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'indeed', 'perfect', 'art', 'design', 'costuming', 'atmospheric', 'direction', 'Sturridge-', 'Glubbdubdrib', 'section', 'brilliantly', 'eerie', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'nothing', 'short', 'fantastic', 'studied', 'emotional', 'performance', 'trouble', 'English', 'accent', 'times', 'effects', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'overshadow', 'Steenbergen', 'less', 'memorable', 'still', 'effective', 'star-studded', 'supporting', 'cast', 'impresses', 'especially', ""O'Toole"", 'Lilliputian', 'Emperor', 'Nicholas', 'Lyndhurst', 'Clustril', 'music', 'near', 'perfect', 'well.Overall', 'decent', 'outing', 'everyone', 'involved', 'worth', 'viewing', 'again', 'may', 'be', 'hesitant', 'read', 'books.Grade', '***', '*****']",Gulliver's Travels VHS

402278,A1EKTLUL24HDG8,6304111835,Bill R. Moore,"[4, 4]","I recently watched this film, which features Ted Danson at the head of an all-star cast. As Swift's book is one of my all-time favorites, I was interested to see this depiction of it - but I also approached it cautiously, because it is a hard novel to film, and I was skeptical of Danson's ability to pull off the lead role. I am glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised; the movie is generally well-done, and Danson does a superb job, as does the rest of the cast. I was impressed that the movie managed to adequately convey all of the requisite special effects without being overdone and/or cheesy. I was also glad to see that it managed to show a real sense of the totality of Swift's novel, from its charming and playful aspects to its fiery, misanthropic satire; unlike previous productions, it features all four parts of the book, despite a few inevitable cuts. It did veer from the book significantly in a few instances, particularly in its use of a new subplot that functions as a framing device; despite the extra-literary aspect of this content, though, I found it to be an acceptable and effective means of representing the story on film. Those involved also did a solid job of conveying a good overall sense of Swift's savage satire, although the altered ending does lose some of its biting, misanthropic edge as it is presented in the film. I believe that it would have been a better film if it had retained the original ending, but it remains a solid and thoroughly enjoyable adaptation.",4,A Worthy Adaptation,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",2009,1504,"['recently', 'watched', 'film', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'head', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Swift', 'book', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'depiction', 'also', 'approached', 'cautiously', 'hard', 'novel', 'film', 'was', 'skeptical', 'Danson', 'ability', 'pull', 'off', 'lead', 'role', 'am', 'glad', 'say', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'generally', 'well-done', 'Danson', 'superb', 'job', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'impressed', 'movie', 'managed', 'adequately', 'convey', 'requisite', 'special', 'effects', 'being', 'overdone', 'and/or', 'cheesy', 'was', 'also', 'glad', 'see', 'managed', 'show', 'real', 'sense', 'totality', 'Swift', 'novel', 'charming', 'playful', 'aspects', 'fiery', 'misanthropic', 'satire', 'previous', 'productions', 'four', 'parts', 'book', 'few', 'inevitable', 'cuts', 'did', 'veer', 'book', 'significantly', 'few', 'instances', 'particularly', 'use', 'new', 'subplot', 'functions', 'framing', 'device', 'extra-literary', 'aspect', 'content', 'found', 'be', 'acceptable', 'effective', 'means', 'representing', 'story', 'film', 'involved', 'also', 'did', 'solid', 'job', 'conveying', 'good', 'overall', 'sense', 'Swift', 'savage', 'satire', 'altered', 'ending', 'lose', 'biting', 'misanthropic', 'edge', 'presented', 'film', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'retained', 'original', 'ending', 'solid', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'adaptation']",Gulliver's Travels VHS

Every time they see a story that has lasted for one or more centuries on its own, their immediate reaction is that the story needs major improvement.How do they do it?  Certain methods are a given: start with an unappealing star.  Make sure he has an accent as far from that required by the story as possible (in this case British).Having trashed the main character, you may now turn your attention to finding ways to ruin the story.  In this case, make it easy for yourself and throw in a different story and put the main emphasis on that.  Then, squeeze the original story so that there is not enough time to do it justice.  Then, prevent anyone from getting caught up in the original story by cutting away from this story every minute or so--since, of course, nobody's interested in Gulliver's travels anyway--and get back to your own trashy, off-the-shelf story--which, of course, everybody is interested in.Et voila!  You have another movie ready to be purchased, watched once and thrown into the trash can.If you're curious as to how this story might have been handled, see the BBC movie ""Gulliver in Lilliput"" (1988).

Had the production remained with the text far greater clarity would emerge, and we could read this remarkable exposition of our present mercantile war machine with extremes of poverty and great wealth at the pain of the majority, the pretentious of our society, well, and thoroughly, as written. As it is we are left dizzy, and the desperate Jack Black inevitable.This is not comedy. This is not farce. This is not stuff for Rob Schneider and Kevin James and Adam Sandler.

What a waste of great Geilgud, of Mr. O'Toole, of Geraldine. What an alteration of the themes and foundations, including in raising feminist rather than economic concerns, as the women here are ever the good, the smart, the powerful, rather than, in the end, the horse.What a waste of a wonderful high level production which fails by falling from the text as written.Please, Lord, spare me the pain of witnessing the coming horror of Jack Black, star ofNacho Libre (Special Collector's Edition)!Let us rather read this text as written, throughThe Essential Writings of Jonathan Swift (Norton Critical Editions).Let us view, if view we must, earlier, horrified, critical responses inA Voyage into the Black & Bizarre Imagination of Dr. Jonathan Swift Including Gulliver's Travels & Other Obscene Creations.

Gulliver, his wife, and son - they are all excellent actors; particularly when Gulliver recounts his fabulous adventures to his believing young son - they are a charming duo. Peter O'Toole is also hilarious as the cruel and petty, but adorably tiny, King of Lilliput.The story is delivered on screen with ingenious skill: remember, there are two stories to be told at once - Gulliver's travels, as he relives them with us, the viewer, and Gulliver after his travels, as he tells them to us, the viewer. These are two sides of the same coin, and the filmmakers weave them together with clever artistry.In the second half of the film, the novelty of experiencing all of what I've just described wears off, and the travels become aimless wanderings, where Gulliver becomes stern and preachy about the failings of human nature.

402282,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,6304111835,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[60, 63]","Contrary to popular belief, Jonathan Swift's &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot; was never intended to be simply a children's fantasy / fairy tale.  Although the Lilliputans are cute as heck, this story has some serious overtones.  As a matter of fact, although more subtle perhaps, there are aspects of this tale which are  as dark and bitter as the commentaries on humankind written by the likes of  Dostoevsky, Camus and Kafka.  Jonathan Swift never was a very happy man.This rendition of Swift's classic is, in a word, fabulous.  It reaches to the heart of the message Swift was trying to convey while at the same time is accessible to all.  It is also appropriate for a family to watch.  I cannot remark enough on just how well done this film was;  it would have been so easy to do a half-baked job and let it be yet another ambitious television movie that somehow went awry.  I'm so glad that didn't happen here.In truth, I have never cared too much for Ted Danson.  However, in this film he delivers a surprisingly exceptional performance.  So much so, in fact, that looking back I can't imagine anyone else as Gulliver.  The rest of the cast did a superb job as well, and the inclusion of Peter O'Toole as the king of the Lilliputans was a great touch.  (Then again, when can having Peter O'Toole in the cast of a movie ever HURT?)  The direction and the way they chose to tell the story was wonderfully done.  The soundtrack (written by Trevor Jones, who co-wrote the soundtrack to &quot;The Last Of The Mohicans&quot; among other things) was right on the $$$ for emotionally gripping scenes.This is the type of ambitious, fervent film-making that studios can be proud of.

Who has a little insight into a psychological point of view, will moreover discover, that in the gigantic Gulliver, with whom the childlike spectator of course identifies himself at the first meeting, - that this Gulliver helps to become resistant against every nasty surroundings, which will happen to us in our lifetime, using a fantasy-based, satirical technique of making bad things small and unimportant! Swift gives a therapeutically example for children (always being the smaller ones, helpless, powerless at the lower rank of the social influence scale) how to make a wonderful reversal of the everyday fright. The Gulliver shape reconciles to the powerlessness feelings of the childhood. When Jonathan Swift wrote this story, the situation of childhood in Europe was substantially worse than today. Gulliver's journey to the country of the dwarves (Liliput) is the favorite story. But the other one, his journey to the giants in the land ""Brobdingnag"" is more unloved.

Max Gooding,"[2, 2]","This is about the best film adaptation of the original novel that was written by Jonathan Swift, an Irish writer and clergyman in the early 1700s. The novel was meant to be a clever  parody mixture of  travelers' tales, the court of George I, King of England, and the petty differences of religion that lead to wars.The story centers on Lemuel Gulliver, a medical doctor and a ship's captain. As the plot progresses he is left alone on various mystical locations. Each place has its own unique characteristics this makes the adventure quite intriguing as the story progresses.The Movie is broken down into two 'Books':Book 1[1] Adventure at rival countries of Lilliput and Blefuscu. Here Gulliver is about 12 times the size of everyone else at that location.[2] Adventure at Brobdingnag : Here Gulliver is one twelfth the size of everyone there.Book 2[1] The Flying Island - Laputa  - satire on the Royal Society[2] Empress Muodi's Estate[3] Glubbdubdrib - the magician's dwelling - ancients versus moderns theme[4] Struldburgs - immortals with blindness[5] Houyhnhnms / Yahoos - deals with the inherent corrupt nature of mankindThe film features some very exotic locations including three palaces in Portugal, as well as fanciful building structures in England and a marble banquet hall on an estate in rural East Anglia.The acting is superb and the cast features well known actors.

In art direction and general feel, this production of the Jonathan Swift classic resembled ""Amadeus"" more than it resembled ""The Winds Of War"" or ""Mother, Can I Sleep With Danger?"".And considering the choice for the titular lead, comic actor and former model Ted Danson, it could have been a real disaster. It wasn't! The man acquits himself nicely as the somewhat incredulous Lemuel Gulliver, the hero of a satirical tale told by the very cynical Jonathan Swift, Britain's answer to Voltaire. (Actually, Voltaire was a good deal younger than Swift and ""Gulliver's Travels"" was written 32-33 years before ""Candide"", allegedly, but they _were_ contemporaries, and had even met!)The story features very fanciful alllusions to pettiness, classic paranoia of the delusions of grandeur variety, pomposity, a favorite target of Swift's, and superciliousness. There's the tiny Lilliputians, their opposites, the Brondignagians, the equine Houiynihms, (who, I seem to remember, were supposed to resemble giraffes as well,) and many other fantastic characters, all rendered beautifully in this, the first of a distinguished list of first rate classical adaptations shown on NBC in the late 90s.The cast list is unbelievable...people who had NEVER been on TV before, like Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, James Fox, Isabelle Huppert, Geraldine Chaplin (hello!), Shashi Kapoor and John Gielgud were sprinkled all through it. The sets are incredible and acting superb. If either this or the later ""The Odyssey"" had been released as feature films, they would have garnered significant praise for production values and acting, as well as fidelity to their sources, (despite some serious key scene omissions,) and probably would have generated respectable box office.Special effects, cinematography and scene direction made this a good bellwether for a raft of films unlike any TV had ever seen since the fifties, when top quality productions of plays by well known playwrights peppered prime time schedules.The general take on the story treats the main character, Lemuel Gulliver, as someone just about everybody, including his wife, for a while, thinks is certifiably insane, as he keeps rambling on about the fantastic lands and people he has supposedly seen. Most of the ""real world"" story, in fact, takes place in either an asylum, where he has been committed, or a courtroom, where his case is being heard.It's obvious to the viewer, too, that Lemuel has dreamt all of this, because these places couldn't possibly exist. However, a real curve ball is thrown in the end when a truly diminutive sheep is found and provided as evidence that at least proves Lilliput existed.Mary Steenbergen went on after this, ( a lot of the actors were recycled in future productions of this type by Halmi,) to portray the wife of Noah in a gawd-awful NBC production of  ""Noah's Ark"", a production that mated the story of Lot and Sodom & Gomorah, (sans Abraham,) with the story of the flood. There was a ridiculous dream sequence inserted in this disaster that showed that Halmi's production crew was getting a WEE bit too satisfied with itself as Steenbergen, especially, spoke bubbleheaded lines that seemed WAY out of place for the setting of the story.She should have stuck with 18th century satires! :-)",5,I know I usually give 4 stars as my best...,1075420800,"01 30, 2004",2004,3545,"['Hallmark', 'TV', 'production', 'was', 'so', 'exceptional', 'felt', 'five', 'was', 'least', 'sucker', 'deserved.This', 'was', 'first', 'extended', 'series', 'high-toned', 'TV', 'movies', 'produced', 'Robert', 'Halmi', 'Sr.', 'NBC', 'ABC', 'had', 'production', 'values', 'previously', 'unseen', 'television', 'art', 'direction', 'general', 'feel', 'production', 'Jonathan', 'Swift', 'classic', 'resembled', 'Amadeus', 'more', 'resembled', 'Winds', 'War', 'Mother', 'Can', 'Sleep', 'Danger', '.And', 'considering', 'choice', 'titular', 'lead', 'comic', 'actor', 'former', 'model', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'disaster', 'was', ""n't"", 'man', 'nicely', 'somewhat', 'incredulous', 'Lemuel', 'Gulliver', 'hero', 'satirical', 'tale', 'told', 'very', 'cynical', 'Jonathan', 'Swift', 'Britain', 'answer', 'Voltaire', 'Actually', 'Voltaire', 'was', 'good', 'deal', 'younger', 'Swift', 'Gulliver', 'Travels', 'was', 'written', '32-33', 'years', 'Candide', 'allegedly', '_were_', 'contemporaries', 'had', 'even', 'met', 'story', 'very', 'fanciful', 'alllusions', 'pettiness', 'classic', 'paranoia', 'delusions', 'grandeur', 'variety', 'pomposity', 'favorite', 'target', 'Swift', 'superciliousness', 'tiny', 'Lilliputians', 'opposites', 'Brondignagians', 'equine', 'Houiynihms', 'who', 'seem', 'remember', 'were', 'supposed', 'resemble', 'giraffes', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'other', 'fantastic', 'characters', 'rendered', 'beautifully', 'first', 'distinguished', 'list', 'first', 'rate', 'classical', 'adaptations', 'shown', 'NBC', 'late', '90s.The', 'cast', 'list', 'unbelievable', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'NEVER', 'been', 'TV', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'James', 'Fox', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'hello', 'Shashi', 'Kapoor', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'were', 'sprinkled', 'sets', 'are', 'incredible', 'acting', 'superb', 'later', 'Odyssey', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'feature', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'garnered', 'significant', 'praise', 'production', 'values', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'fidelity', 'sources', 'serious', 'key', 'scene', 'omissions', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'generated', 'respectable', 'box', 'office.Special', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'scene', 'direction', 'made', 'good', 'bellwether', 'raft', 'films', 'TV', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'fifties', 'when', 'top', 'quality', 'productions', 'plays', 'well', 'known', 'playwrights', 'peppered', 'prime', 'time', 'schedules.The', 'general', 'take', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'Lemuel', 'Gulliver', 'someone', 'just', 'everybody', 'including', 'wife', 'while', 'certifiably', 'insane', 'rambling', 'fantastic', 'lands', 'people', 'supposedly', 'seen', 'Most', 'real', 'world', 'story', 'fact', 'place', 'asylum', 'where', 'been', 'committed', 'courtroom', 'where', 'case', 'being', 'obvious', 'viewer', 'too', 'Lemuel', 'dreamt', 'places', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'exist', 'However', 'real', 'curve', 'ball', 'thrown', 'end', 'when', 'truly', 'diminutive', 'sheep', 'found', 'provided', 'evidence', 'least', 'proves', 'Lilliput', 'existed.Mary', 'Steenbergen', 'went', 'lot', 'actors', 'were', 'recycled', 'future', 'productions', 'type', 'Halmi', 'portray', 'wife', 'Noah', 'gawd-awful', 'NBC', 'production', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'production', 'mated', 'story', 'Lot', 'Sodom', 'Gomorah', 'sans', 'Abraham', 'story', 'flood', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'dream', 'sequence', 'inserted', 'disaster', 'showed', 'Halmi', 'production', 'crew', 'was', 'getting', 'WEE', 'bit', 'too', 'satisfied', 'Steenbergen', 'especially', 'spoke', 'bubbleheaded', 'lines', 'seemed', 'WAY', 'place', 'setting', 'story.She', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', '18th', 'century', 'satires']",Gulliver's Travels VHS
402297,A255E1L105V4MU,6304111835,Robert Carlberg,"[23, 23]","I recall being enormously impressed with this 2-part made-for-TV movie when it was first broadcast in 1996, and the intervening twelve years have not diminished it any.  The production is fairly true to Swift's original, and contains many innovative and surprisingly-effective special effects (for the time).  All of the cast members give boffo performances, particularly hammy Peter O'Toole in the role of a lifetime.  But most impressive of all is the gentle and very sly interweaving of fantasy and insanity, where Lemuel Gulliver's state of mind continuously shifts between frames of reference both in size and veracity.Swift's vulgar sense of humor is given free expression, and the biting satire of his political wit still rings familiar 270 years later.

402305,A4JHEO7H330AF,6304111835,Tom Brody,"[8, 8]","The film is told by way of flash backs.  Gulliver (Ted Danson) finds himself ashore in England after a harrowing nine year absence from home.  Unfortunately, once back at home in England, he suffers from periodic flashbacks wherein he provides narratives about his adventures in Lilliput, Brobdingnag, on a flying island, and elsewhere.  Also unfortunately, even his wife (Mary Steenbergen; wife in real life too) does not believe the contents of his flash-back narratives.  For example, towards the end of the movie she is asked if she believes her husband.  Instead of saying ""no,"" she avoids the question by replying, ""I believe in him.""Everybody will be able to enjoy the brightly colored pomp and fanfares found in the various kingdoms that are encountered during Gulliver's travels.  The special effects are almost as good as those found in the early Star Wars movies.  Unlike most adventure movies, the movie under review has a high degree of character development.  The credentials of the actors, e.g., Peter O'Toole, speak for themselves. Excellent ""character actors"" are also found, such as the rustic wheat farmer who discovers Gulliver and displays him in a one-man circus.  In addition to the special effects, the presence of a boy character (Gulliver's son) and a girl character (wheat farmer's daughter) enhance the attraction of the film for kids.What the movie is really ""about"" is not tiny villagers, flying islands, or talking horses.  What the movie is really about is certain bizarre aspects of the social order, found at the time of Swift's writing.  For example, one goal of the Gulliver story was to protest the practice of selling (as opposed to voting) government positions.  Therefore, it might be to the advantage of any viewer, or parent, to become familiar with the social/political customs prevalent at the time.  A suitable book (which actually covers France, not England), is The French Revolution and Human Rights by Lynn Hunt (1996).  As with the Gulliver movie, this book explains the existance of formalized upper and lower classes, and the practice of selling government positions.",5,Special effects almost in the same league as those in Star Wars.,1166918400,"12 24, 2006",2006,2119,"['film', 'told', 'way', 'flash', 'backs', 'Gulliver', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'ashore', 'England', 'harrowing', 'nine', 'year', 'absence', 'home', 'Unfortunately', 'once', 'back', 'home', 'England', 'periodic', 'flashbacks', 'wherein', 'narratives', 'adventures', 'Lilliput', 'Brobdingnag', 'flying', 'island', 'elsewhere', 'Also', 'unfortunately', 'even', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Steenbergen', 'wife', 'real', 'life', 'too', 'not', 'believe', 'contents', 'flash-back', 'narratives', 'example', 'end', 'movie', 'asked', 'husband', 'Instead', 'saying', 'question', 'replying', 'believe', 'Everybody', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'brightly', 'colored', 'pomp', 'fanfares', 'found', 'various', 'kingdoms', 'are', 'encountered', 'Gulliver', 'travels', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'found', 'early', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movies', 'most', 'adventure', 'movies', 'movie', 'review', 'high', 'degree', 'character', 'development', 'credentials', 'actors', 'e.g.', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'speak', 'Excellent', 'character', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'found', 'such', 'rustic', 'wheat', 'farmer', 'who', 'Gulliver', 'one-man', 'circus', 'addition', 'special', 'effects', 'presence', 'boy', 'character', 'Gulliver', 'son', 'girl', 'character', 'wheat', 'farmer', 'daughter', 'enhance', 'attraction', 'film', 'kids.What', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'tiny', 'villagers', 'flying', 'islands', 'talking', 'horses', 'What', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'certain', 'bizarre', 'aspects', 'social', 'order', 'found', 'time', 'Swift', 'writing', 'example', 'one', 'goal', 'Gulliver', 'story', 'was', 'protest', 'practice', 'selling', 'opposed', 'voting', 'government', 'positions', 'Therefore', 'might', 'be', 'advantage', 'viewer', 'parent', 'become', 'familiar', 'social/political', 'customs', 'prevalent', 'time', 'suitable', 'book', 'actually', 'France', 'not', 'England', 'French', 'Revolution', 'Human', 'Rights', 'Lynn', 'Hunt', '1996', 'Gulliver', 'movie', 'book', 'existance', 'formalized', 'upper', 'lower', 'classes', 'practice', 'selling', 'government', 'positions']",Gulliver's Travels VHS

Unfortunately the twin problems of the book's highly episodic structure and a television budget (even a fairly lavish one) remain. The book is a somewhat rambling collection of traveller's tales moving simply from one surreal landscape to another, but Simon Moore's adaptation tries to impose some order on the chaos by providing a parallel plot that sees Gulliver returned to England clearly deeply traumatised and trying to prove his way out of the insane asylum where the rival for his wife's affections has had him committed. The England scenes at once mirror and comment on the travels, elements of which occasionally spill over into the real world. The trouble is that for the first hour or so it acts more as a distraction, constantly pulling you away from the story just as it starts to get interesting. The Lilliput scenes suffer worse here, with the feeling that the home scenes are too often designed to save them from filming the more expensive setpieces - this has to be the only version where we don't see Gulliver pulling the Blefescu fleet behind him.Yet once Gulliver makes his escape, the tone becomes more consistent as he finds his situation reversed and himself the pet of the giants of the Utopians of Brobdingnag, a guest of the wise men of the floating island of Laputa who are so engrossed in science that they have no common sense left, the guest/prisoner of a historian who learns history directly from the source, offered immortality with all it's terrible consequences before finally finding a world he wants to belong if only he can convince the sublime talking horses the Houynhnhms that he's not an uncivilized Yahoo, each new destination convincing him of what an absurd and petty species humanity is. For the most part it's a darker set of Travels than expected, with only Gulliver's curiosity and commonsense and disappointment keeping it from plunging into irretrievable bleakness - and even this is offset by the scenes in the asylum where it becomes more obvious that even if he is telling the truth it may well have driven him genuinely insane. It's in these latter scenes that Ted Danson's Gulliver really shines, never more so than in an extraordinary speech where he turns his trial into a disappointed judgment on the whole human race.Being made for television, the Yahoos are rather less literally scatological here than on the page, but for the most part this is a more adult treatment than you might expect with no real dumbing down. The star cast is certainly impressive, and for the most part well-used (if somewhat briefly in a few cases) - Mary Steenburgen, James Fox, Peter O'Toole, Edward Woodward, Omar Sharif, Shashi Kapoor, Edward Fox, Ned Beatty, Alfre Woodard, Kristin Scott Thomas and Isabelle Huppert among them.

So many people have loved (or at least read) it, that it presents difficult target for movie-makers. No matter how they render it, they're sure to violate someone's image of the story. Despite a very few flaws, this version works remarkably well.For one thing, it presents a reasonably complete telling of Lemuel Gulliver's story. I haven't read the original lately, but this seems to cover the entire tale, not just famous favorites like the visit to Lilliput. It also covers some of the moments that other versions skip, like putting out the Lilliputian palace fire. A parody of academic research holds up well, too, and might be even more relevant today than when Swift poked fun at the Royal Society's experimenters. Competent special effects make it easy to suspend disbelief for the film's duration.Perhaps it's unfair, but the high points of this recreation work so well that the few low points seem even lower by contrast. The visit to Brobdingnag retains its political bite, buthis made-for-TV movie had to cut a few ""adult"" moments from Swift's version. The Struldbrugs really suffered at this director's hands, though. Perhaps there was some political correctness issue in toning their senility down, but that passage lost nearly all the impact of the original.The good outweighs the bad, however, and the good includes some remarkable star power, including Omar Sharif, Peter O'Toole, and John Gielgud in brief but significant roles. The storytelling format works too, as flashbacks of story bubble up through Gulliver's damaged mind.
