308560,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302354145,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","For feeling rather like a cheap rip-off of `All About Eve' and `Sunset Blvd.', `The Star' sports a brilliant performance by one of the world's greatest legends.  In fact, it is Davis herself that saves this film for me.  Outside of her wonderful performance (so many layers) the film just doesn't quite stack up.The film tells the story of a washed up actress named Margaret Elliot, a one time Oscar winning starlet who has been reduced to nothing thanks to her diva attitude, her age and her generosity.  She is now dead-broke and unemployed.  When she finds herself arrested for intoxication and then subsequently rescued by a former co-star turned boat mechanic, Margaret is forced to accept what she has become and what exactly lies in her future; but she isn't willing to.  Instead, she vies for a certain part she has a special love for, despite the fact that the character is far too young for her to betray.  Instead of accepting to baity role she was offered, she tries her hand at convincing the director to give her the other part, in the end sabotaging her own success.The films center, which tells the story of a woman afraid to face reality, is a poignant one.  It is also one that has been broached many times, better.  The film itself has a very cheap quality, and the script (the most important part) seems rather rushed and thrown together without any real sense of cohesive direction.  A lot of the scenes seem like afterthoughts.BUT, where there are issues with the content there is never an issue as to whether or not Bette Davis is at the top of her game.  She is quite outstanding here.  The great thing about this character is that it is far from anything like the real Bette Davis.  Davis was an actress who, even in her prime, had no problem de-glamming for a particular role.  Look back to 1939 where she played down her looks for `The Old Maid', or how she completely destroyed her features in 1962 for `What Ever Happened to Baby Jane'.  Davis sunk herself into every role, and it shows here as well.  We don't see Davis pretending to be a vain washed up actress.  We see the vanity as if it were ingrown; steeped in her very being.  Her test scene sequence alone is flawlessly delivered, and better yet is the scene where she witnesses that said sequence alone, in the viewing room.Sadly, Davis is not backed up by a respectable cast.  I love Natalie Wood (the later years) but her child performance here is pretty awful.  Sterling Hayden is even worse.  Next to Davis he appears like a wooden caricature.  It's depressing to see Davis's talent wasted on a film not worthy of her.Still, this was a tour-de-force performance, and so I totally recommend seeing this if you are a fan of Davis.  Bette Davis rightfully won two Academy Awards; I'm only saddened that they were won at the beginning of her career.  I have no problem with her performances in `Jezebel' and `Dangerous' (for which she won her Oscars), in fact I love those performances; but if it were up to me Davis would have golden boys for her performances in `All About Eve' and this clunky drama.  Yes, despite the overall lack of effect this film has, Davis rises far above her material to deliver a remarkably respectable performance.",3,"Bette's star never fades, despite a dim script...",1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,3230,"['feeling', 'rather', 'cheap', 'rip-off', 'Eve', 'Sunset', 'Blvd', 'Star', 'sports', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'one', 'world', 'greatest', 'legends', 'fact', 'Davis', 'film', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'stack', 'up.The', 'film', 'story', 'washed', 'up', 'actress', 'named', 'Margaret', 'Elliot', 'one', 'time', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'starlet', 'who', 'been', 'reduced', 'nothing', 'thanks', 'diva', 'attitude', 'age', 'generosity', 'now', 'dead-broke', 'unemployed', 'When', 'arrested', 'intoxication', 'then', 'subsequently', 'rescued', 'former', 'co-star', 'turned', 'boat', 'mechanic', 'Margaret', 'forced', 'accept', 'what', 'become', 'what', 'exactly', 'future', ""n't"", 'willing', 'Instead', 'certain', 'part', 'special', 'love', 'fact', 'character', 'far', 'too', 'young', 'betray', 'Instead', 'accepting', 'baity', 'role', 'was', 'offered', 'hand', 'convincing', 'director', 'give', 'other', 'part', 'end', 'sabotaging', 'own', 'success.The', 'films', 'center', 'story', 'woman', 'afraid', 'face', 'reality', 'poignant', 'one', 'also', 'one', 'been', 'broached', 'many', 'times', 'better', 'film', 'very', 'cheap', 'quality', 'script', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'rather', 'rushed', 'thrown', 'together', 'real', 'sense', 'cohesive', 'direction', 'lot', 'scenes', 'seem', 'afterthoughts.BUT', 'where', 'are', 'issues', 'content', 'never', 'issue', 'not', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'top', 'game', 'quite', 'outstanding', 'here', 'great', 'thing', 'character', 'far', 'anything', 'real', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Davis', 'was', 'actress', 'who', 'even', 'prime', 'had', 'problem', 'de-glamming', 'particular', 'role', 'Look', 'back', '1939', 'where', 'played', 'down', 'looks', 'Old', 'Maid', 'how', 'completely', 'destroyed', 'features', '1962', 'What', 'Ever', 'Happened', 'Baby', 'Jane', 'Davis', 'sunk', 'role', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Davis', 'pretending', 'be', 'vain', 'washed', 'up', 'actress', 'see', 'vanity', 'were', 'ingrown', 'steeped', 'very', 'being', 'test', 'scene', 'sequence', 'alone', 'flawlessly', 'delivered', 'better', 'yet', 'scene', 'where', 'said', 'sequence', 'alone', 'viewing', 'room.Sadly', 'Davis', 'not', 'backed', 'up', 'respectable', 'cast', 'love', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'later', 'years', 'child', 'performance', 'here', 'pretty', 'awful', 'Sterling', 'Hayden', 'even', 'worse', 'Next', 'Davis', 'wooden', 'caricature', 'depressing', 'see', 'Davis', 'talent', 'wasted', 'film', 'not', 'worthy', 'her.Still', 'was', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'so', 'totally', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'are', 'fan', 'Davis', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'rightfully', 'won', 'two', 'Academy', 'Awards', ""'m"", 'only', 'saddened', 'were', 'won', 'beginning', 'career', 'have', 'problem', 'performances', 'Jezebel', 'Dangerous', 'won', 'Oscars', 'fact', 'love', 'performances', 'were', 'up', 'Davis', 'would', 'have', 'golden', 'boys', 'performances', 'Eve', 'clunky', 'drama', 'Yes', 'overall', 'lack', 'effect', 'film', 'Davis', 'far', 'material', 'deliver', 'remarkably', 'respectable', 'performance']",N/A
308561,A383RRF34W2UFS,6302354145,Audra Thomas,"[5, 5]","Yes, of course, this movie is a Bette Davis vehicle, and a worthy one, definitely worth seeing. As AllAboutEve, the iconic and great behind-the-scenes ""at the Theatre"" movie, TheStar is a lesser work, though still very much a behind-the-scenes look at an actress whose glory days seem to be well behind her. I have always thought that AllAboutEve and TheStar should be seen back-to-back. The first, so very glossy and glamorous and the latter very much its antithesis... definitely the darker side of a career... but perhaps great book-ends, one to the other.What moves me to write, here, is the presence of Sterling Hayden, and I write in response to the negative comments made concerning his casting in and his performance in this movie.Sterling Hayden was a fascinating man; he hated the Hollywood game, and hated being an actor... and longed to be sailing his boat(s); he was a serious sailor, and successfully authored non-fiction and fictional, critically much-acclaimed accounts of life on the high-seas. He was the quintessential Nordic-god: very tall, very blond and was ""discovered"" on a California beach when a very young man. Throughout his Hollywood career, as soon as they yelled ""cut"", he raced off the soundstage and down to his boat. I think it extremely interesting that, in TheStar he protrays a disillusioned onetime actor, who ""gave it all up"" and goes on to purchase a shipyard/dry-dock... and at the spur-of-the-moment, is always delighted to take the boat out onto the water for an afternoon of sailing. Is this art mimic-ing life? I wonder what his career might have been like had he really ""taken-to"" the Hollywood experience.Besides being a wonderful physical foil to the physically diminutive Bette Davis in TheStar, his performance, which is very natural (not easy to achieve... acting while appearing NOT to be acting), is the rock to which Bette Davis clings as she gradually accepts the transition taking-place in her life... thus his natural performance is (also) the low-key foil to that of the over-the-top tumultuous Davis; it's all about contrasting... just like those two luminous and contrasting performances in AllAboutEve: that of Margo Channing and that of Karen Richards. And... the gentleman's voice!!! Tall. blond and commanding... yet calming and steady: 'certainly works for me!Getting-back to AllAboutEve, who can forget that wonderful monologue in the stalled car, in which Margo Channing laments: 'the things a woman lets-go-of ""on the way up"", to move faster, she'll find later-on that she needs when resuming the one career that all women have in-common: being a woman'.TheStar depicts the outcome of that pivotal monologue in AllAboutEve... being ""just a woman"" ... and not a star with a ""French Provincial office"". And, if being ""just a woman""... when it's all said-and-done and all over with,  means falling into the arms of a Sterling Hayden... again, all I can say is:That would work just fine for me!",4,Sterling Hayden could rescue me ANYTIME...,1240790400,"04 27, 2009",2009,2958,"['Yes', 'course', 'movie', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'vehicle', 'worthy', 'one', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'AllAboutEve', 'iconic', 'great', 'behind-the-scenes', 'Theatre', 'movie', 'TheStar', 'lesser', 'work', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'actress', 'glory', 'days', 'seem', 'be', 'well', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'AllAboutEve', 'TheStar', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'back-to-back', 'first', 'so', 'very', 'glossy', 'glamorous', 'latter', 'very', 'much', 'antithesis', 'definitely', 'darker', 'side', 'career', 'perhaps', 'great', 'book-ends', 'one', 'other.What', 'write', 'here', 'presence', 'Sterling', 'Hayden', 'write', 'response', 'negative', 'comments', 'made', 'concerning', 'casting', 'performance', 'movie.Sterling', 'Hayden', 'was', 'fascinating', 'man', 'hated', 'Hollywood', 'game', 'hated', 'being', 'actor', 'longed', 'be', 'sailing', 'boat', 'was', 'serious', 'sailor', 'successfully', 'authored', 'non-fiction', 'fictional', 'critically', 'much-acclaimed', 'accounts', 'life', 'high-seas', 'was', 'quintessential', 'Nordic-god', 'very', 'tall', 'very', 'blond', 'was', 'discovered', 'California', 'beach', 'when', 'very', 'young', 'man', 'Hollywood', 'career', 'as', 'soon', 'yelled', 'cut', 'raced', 'off', 'soundstage', 'down', 'boat', 'think', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'TheStar', 'disillusioned', 'onetime', 'actor', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'purchase', 'shipyard/dry-dock', 'spur-of-the-moment', 'always', 'delighted', 'take', 'boat', 'water', 'afternoon', 'sailing', 'art', 'mimic-ing', 'life', 'wonder', 'what', 'career', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'really', 'taken-to', 'Hollywood', 'experience.Besides', 'being', 'wonderful', 'physical', 'foil', 'physically', 'diminutive', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'TheStar', 'performance', 'very', 'natural', 'not', 'easy', 'achieve', 'acting', 'appearing', 'NOT', 'be', 'acting', 'rock', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'clings', 'gradually', 'transition', 'taking-place', 'life', 'thus', 'natural', 'performance', 'also', 'low-key', 'foil', 'over-the-top', 'tumultuous', 'Davis', 'contrasting', 'just', 'two', 'luminous', 'contrasting', 'performances', 'AllAboutEve', 'Margo', 'Channing', 'Karen', 'Richards', 'gentleman', 'voice', 'Tall', 'blond', 'commanding', 'yet', 'calming', 'steady', ""'certainly"", 'Getting-back', 'AllAboutEve', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'wonderful', 'monologue', 'stalled', 'car', 'Margo', 'Channing', 'laments', ""'the"", 'things', 'woman', 'lets-go-of', 'way', 'up', 'move', 'faster', ""'ll"", 'find', 'later-on', 'when', 'resuming', 'one', 'career', 'women', 'have', 'in-common', 'being', ""woman'.TheStar"", 'outcome', 'pivotal', 'monologue', 'AllAboutEve', 'being', 'just', 'woman', 'not', 'star', 'French', 'Provincial', 'office', 'being', 'just', 'woman', 'when', 'said-and-done', 'falling', 'arms', 'Sterling', 'Hayden', 'again', 'can', 'say', 'would', 'work', 'just', 'fine']",N/A

With her Academy Award riding shotgun on the dashboard.She had everything, she lost everything.  And she winds up with Sterling Hayden???  Well, I guess if you were once adored and admired, winding up with Sterling Hayden just might seem like your ticket out of the mess.The second half of the film is a mess.  Davis, deservedly, got an Oscar nomination for her role, (Shirley Booth, in ""Come Back, Little Sheba"" won that year).  But Davis just MAY have won it if the powers that be had not saddled her with 1: a wooden leading man and 2: making sure that the second half of the film slips into unbelievable melodrama.For Davis, as the aging and forgotten film star, she certainly gives her all in what is a truly meat-and-potatoe's role.  She sinks her teeth in and we love her for it. No need for vegetables.  It's her best role since ""All About Eve"" three years earlier.  And we've been waiting for some time for something like this.  And she delivers.The story itself is a hint of the roller-coaster ride of fame, but in the second half, sadly, the coaster goes off ot its tracks.  Bette Davis' character realizes, or gives up on the fact, that she will never be famous again.  She's forgotten now.

Flat stoney broke, about to be kicked out of her apartment, and unable to find acting work, the former Oscar-winning megastar is reduced to a glimmer of her former self.  Following an all-night drinking binge--capped off by a spin around Beverly Hills with her Oscar in tow--Margaret is arrested.  She's bailed out by a former co-star (Sterling Hayden).  ""When you're a star, you don't stop being a star"", Margaret keeps telling her teenage daughter Gretchen (Natalie Wood).  But stars must also live in reality...something Margaret will struggle terribly with.Bette Davis must have identified a lot with the script of THE STAR, though I don't believe she ever did sink as low as her character does in the movie.  Screenwriters Dale Eunson and Katherine Albert actually based the character of Margaret on another celebrity--none other than Davis' arch-rival Joan Crawford.  The writers had been close friends of Crawford's but the relationship had soured by the time they started work on THE STAR.  Davis must have relished the chance to take a swipe at Crawford--the performance is delicious.  You've gotta love the scene where Margaret prepares for a screentest by rolling her fringe into bangs, applying thickly-caked lipstick and drawing high arches for her eyebrows...remind you of anyone with the initials J.C.?!For the scene in which Margaret goes on an alcoholic bender with her Oscar statuette, Bette Davis provided one of her own (I like to think it was the award she won for ""Dangerous"", in which she played another actress on the skids).  Another twist is the casting of Sterling Hayden as Margaret's love interest (he would later co-star with Joan Crawford in the cult favourite ""Johnny Guitar"").  Natalie Wood, playing daughter Gretchen, gives a distinguished performance.  The cast also features Warner Anderson, Minor Watson, June Travis and Fay Baker.The DVD also includes a new featurette (""How Real is the Star?""), and the trailer.  Highly-recommended for both Davis and Crawford fans.(Single-sided, single-layer disc).

She makes up for a quickie script and cheap Production values by giving a performance that is at times way over-the-top and at other times sensitive and perceptive. Davis' Margaret Elliot is a has-been hag who drinks too much, shouts at people, and is completely removed from reality. In short - she's a Diva, 1950's style. Imagine Margo Channing from ""All About Eve"" after falling on hard times. The script is supposedly based on Joan Crawford but Margaret Elliot is much more Bette Davis in most places, especially in the scene where she comes from her auction only to be greeted by her Sister wanting a monthly check.

Better Davis turns in a fine performance as Margaret Elliot, who in some respects, is a rehash of many characters Davis has played in the past. But, this time, Davis's character is already at her lowest point when the movie begins. Homeless and penniless, Elliot is forced to hold a not too success auction of her personal affects. Things only get worse and she dreams of that one movie role that will bring her back on the top.A lovely young Natalie Wood co-stars as Elliot's daughter. In her innocent eyes, her neglectful mother is still a major star.Margaret Elliot's character is trademark Bette Davis. Davis was adapt at playing beautiful and privileged women whose vanity and self-obession led to self-destruction. But Elliot's character is a bit different, occasionally, we see glimpses of her humanity and vulnerability. She was once super wealthy and took advantage of her status to live a charmed life but also supported deadbeat and needy relatives. She was there meal ticket and that meal has come to an end.Elliot is too vain and self-centered to humble herself when a small but potentially career-restoring role comes her way. Middle-aged yet she believes the starring role of a young lady should be hers.It's a journey of self-discovery and an adoring fan quickly shows up to help her on this path of redemption.The bonus features are brief but fascinating. Margaret Elliot carries her Oscar around with her and according to the film historians, Davis actually used her on Oscar in the film. People suggested Davis was playing a film based on her own life but the historians suggest it was really Joan Crawford's fictionalized life story. Davis never seemed to dwell on vanity and was willing take on roles that didn't always glamorize her. It's interesting to watch Davis in sort of a twilight larger than life role. A few years, later came WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? and many more non-glamorous roles.

308571,A3FGIDFZA4U3O2,6302354145,"Joan Crawford ""Jon""","[22, 22]","I think the reason this film is disliked by so many people is the message which, although true, is not something you can really tell to someone obsessed with the American Dream without expecting some kind of resentment!The story is about a has-been movie star, Margaret Elliott (Bette Davis) who is kind of like to equivalent of Sharon Stone or Demi Moore today. She's only in her 40s, but her career is kind of dead and no one wants to cast her in a movie. She can't understand why, because she used to be such a big star, and now she doesn't know what to do now that her career is going downhill. After much depression and reliance on alcohol, which leads her into drunk driving and a stay in jail, an old friend (Sterling Hayden) bails her out and tries to help her get her life back on track. Since the movie career option is essentially out, he helps her get a job at a department store, but she has too much pride for that kind of work, and ends up a sobbing mess all over again. So Sterling encourages her wishes to go back to acting, after being offered a supporting role in a major picture, but again Margaret Elliot wants to be the star, not the supporting player, and fails to make the screen comeback she wanted.It has been said that THE STAR was based on Joan Crawford, but I don't see many similarities. For one thing, Joan Crawford's career was one of the most durable Hollywood ever produced. Joan actually received an Oscar nomination for SUDDEN FEAR the same year THE STAR garnered Davis a nomination. Of the two, Davis was the bigger has-been in 1952, after a string of flops which included ANOTHER MAN'S POISON and this film, not successful at the box office.I think this is the point where I should say THE STAR is a great film. The theme of the film is that careers are important, but they aren't as important as the relationships we have with other people, such as our family and other loved ones. Some people think this is a sexist slant for the movie, but it's a message equally true for men and women who obsess too much about getting rich and famous instead of just enjoying their lives and being with the people they care about. Again, not a message that's going to be popular with the Bill Gates and Trump crowd--among other extremely ambitious people, but a true message nonetheless.It didn't matter that Margaret Elliott was no longer a star. Being a star is meaningless anyway.

In the role of Margaret Elliot, Bette infuses it with all the angst and self-doubt that a true has been might undergo.Margaret Elliot, dead broke, down and out, can't get a role in tinseltown. Drowning her sorrows in alcohol and self pity, Margaret is in serious denial about herself. As she spirals downward, both personally and professionally, a handsome man (Sterling Hayden), whom she had given a break to many years before, comes to her rescue.When her agent manages to get Margaret a test for the part of an older woman, and it looks like she may have a serious shot at it, Margaret, preferring to play the role of the ingenue, lets her ego take over, and she flubs the test. When she realizes what she has done, her world comes crashing down on her, and self realization sets in. She comes to a crossroad in her life. What decision she comes to remains for the viewer to discover.This is a nineteen fifties style melodrama, stark and grim. Bette has no qualms about appearing as a woman who is aging, as she appears with bags and circles under her eyes and has a somewhat jowly and bitter look. The wardrobe is mostly drab, and the sets are pedestrian. This all works to effect, as these accouterments are symbolic of Margaret Elliot's new reality. Sterling Hayden gives a credible performance as Mr. Nice Guy, though there is a scene in which a moment of politically incorrect domestic violence is interjected.

308578,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6302354145,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","The Star packs a great deal of action, drama and suspense into an extremely good film. The acting is impeccable; with stars like Betty Davis, Natalie Wood and Barbara Lawrence it's tough to miss the target! Of course, Bette Davis gives her usual tour de force performance; and it's great to see her act so convincingly. The cinematography works well throughout the movie; and the choreography shines especially in the scenes at the harbor and the scenes on the movie set where we get a brief movie being filmed within a movie. The plot moves along at a very good pace and I was never once bored.When the action starts, we quickly meet washed-up Hollywood star Margaret Elliott (Bette Davis) who looks absolutely nauseated as she secretly watches an auction of her prized belongings to pay off her creditors. Even one of her closest ""allies"" in the business, Harry Stone (Warner Anderson), walks out with her crystal chandelier and he doesn't give it back to Margaret even when he see that she's devastated by it all. Margaret pushes Harry to talk to studio boss Joe Morrison (Minor Watson) to get her a part in ""The Fatal Winter;"" but Harry isn't about to go out on a limb to help Margaret just yet, either.To make matters even worse for poor Margaret, the management company where she rents a modest apartment is now practically banging on the door for back rent long overdue and her daughter Gretchen (Natalie Wood) must live with her ex-husband and his new wife because Margaret can't afford the expenses of having her own child live with her. Margaret's sister (Fay Baker) and her brother-in-law Roy (Herb Vigran) want yet another monthly support check from Margaret who finally blows her top and throws them out!Margaret can't take all this; she gets drunk and drives recklessly with her Oscar all over Hollywood. She gets arrested for drunk driving but after a night in jail she gets bailed out by a man for whom she once got a juicy movie role, Jim Johannson (Sterling Hayden). Jim feels sympathy and genuine affection for Margaret and he likes her daughter Gretchen as well. Jim coaches Margaret into taking a job at a department store as a saleslady but this doesn't last long; Margaret is too proud for this letdown after being a huge Hollywood star. Margaret does get a chance through Harry to play a small role in a picture but she flubs the rehearsal by playing the role as if she were much younger than they wanted her character to be; and Margaret again sinks into despair.What will happen to Margaret? Will she ever return to pictures--there's a guy with a screenplay and he says it's just right for Margaret--is it right for her? What about Margaret and Gretchen--will they ever be able to live together again? And what happens to Jim, who cares so much about Margaret's life--will he be able to eventually get her back on track in life? No plot spoilers here folks--watch the movie and find out!The DVD comes with one extra besides scene selection; we get a bonus entitled ""How Real Is The Star?"" There is the theatrical trailer as well.The Star is one of Bette Davis' great movies, even though some will say that her career was going downhill when she made it. Her acting absolutely mesmerized me; I couldn't take my eyes off her. What a performer! I highly recommend this film for her fans and people who enjoy classic movies will want to get this DVD, too.",5,Bette amazes me--and what a look we get at Hollywood behind the scenes !!!,1241827200,"05 9, 2009",2009,3377,"['Star', 'great', 'deal', 'action', 'drama', 'suspense', 'extremely', 'good', 'film', 'acting', 'impeccable', 'stars', 'Betty', 'Davis', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Barbara', 'Lawrence', 'tough', 'miss', 'target', 'course', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'usual', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'great', 'see', 'act', 'so', 'convincingly', 'cinematography', 'well', 'movie', 'choreography', 'shines', 'especially', 'scenes', 'harbor', 'scenes', 'movie', 'set', 'where', 'get', 'brief', 'movie', 'being', 'filmed', 'movie', 'plot', 'along', 'very', 'good', 'pace', 'was', 'never', 'once', 'action', 'quickly', 'meet', 'washed-up', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'Margaret', 'Elliott', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'who', 'absolutely', 'nauseated', 'secretly', 'auction', 'prized', 'belongings', 'pay', 'off', 'creditors', 'Even', 'one', 'closest', 'allies', 'business', 'Harry', 'Stone', 'Warner', 'Anderson', 'out', 'crystal', 'chandelier', ""n't"", 'give', 'back', 'Margaret', 'even', 'when', 'see', 'devastated', 'Margaret', 'Harry', 'talk', 'studio', 'boss', 'Joe', 'Morrison', 'Minor', 'Watson', 'get', 'part', 'Fatal', 'Winter', 'Harry', ""n't"", 'about', 'go', 'out', 'limb', 'help', 'Margaret', 'just', 'yet', 'either.To', 'make', 'matters', 'even', 'worse', 'poor', 'Margaret', 'management', 'company', 'where', 'modest', 'apartment', 'now', 'practically', 'banging', 'door', 'back', 'rent', 'long', 'overdue', 'daughter', 'Gretchen', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'must', 'live', 'ex-husband', 'new', 'wife', 'Margaret', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'expenses', 'having', 'own', 'child', 'live', 'Margaret', 'sister', 'Fay', 'Baker', 'brother-in-law', 'Roy', 'Herb', 'Vigran', 'want', 'yet', 'monthly', 'support', 'check', 'Margaret', 'who', 'finally', 'top', 'out', 'Margaret', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'drunk', 'recklessly', 'Oscar', 'over', 'Hollywood', 'arrested', 'drunk', 'driving', 'night', 'jail', 'bailed', 'out', 'man', 'whom', 'once', 'got', 'juicy', 'movie', 'role', 'Jim', 'Johannson', 'Sterling', 'Hayden', 'Jim', 'sympathy', 'genuine', 'affection', 'Margaret', 'daughter', 'Gretchen', 'as', 'well', 'Jim', 'Margaret', 'taking', 'job', 'department', 'store', 'saleslady', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'Margaret', 'too', 'proud', 'letdown', 'being', 'huge', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'Margaret', 'get', 'chance', 'Harry', 'play', 'small', 'role', 'picture', 'flubs', 'rehearsal', 'playing', 'role', 'were', 'much', 'younger', 'wanted', 'character', 'be', 'Margaret', 'again', 'despair.What', 'will', 'happen', 'Margaret', 'Will', 'ever', 'return', 'pictures', 'guy', 'screenplay', 'just', 'right', 'Margaret', 'right', 'What', 'Margaret', 'Gretchen', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'live', 'together', 'again', 'what', 'Jim', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'Margaret', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'eventually', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'life', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'here', 'folks', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'DVD', 'one', 'extra', 'scene', 'selection', 'get', 'bonus', 'entitled', 'How', 'Real', 'Star', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'well.The', 'Star', 'one', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'great', 'movies', 'even', 'will', 'say', 'career', 'was', 'going', 'downhill', 'when', 'made', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'mesmerized', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'What', 'performer', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'movies', 'will', 'want', 'get', 'DVD', 'too']",N/A

308581,A1WTHRVF9UUN0R,6302354145,Oliver Penn,"[57, 57]","I'm shocked that so many reviewers here were disappointed in Bette Davis' appearance, wardrobe, lighting and make up in this film. People, she was playing a dead broke has been. She looked perfect for this role as Margaret Elliot, the once glamorous Oscar-winning star of the movies. Had she looked like the stylish Margo Channing of ""All About Eve"", her ""Margaret Elliot"" wouldn't have been as convincing.Okay, the script wasn't perfect, but Davis approached this material like a true professional and gave the role everything she had, which was plenty. Davis never really cared about the way she looked and accepted the fact that she was no Garbo or Jean Harlow. She had played unglamorous parts many times before. Miss Davis was a true actress, an artist.The picture is ""dark"", yes, but if it had been anything else, it would have ruined this film. The atmosphere created by the director was appropriate for the situation. Margaret was in trouble. She was scared to death and was desperate to get ""back where I belong."" She felt that ""one good part"" was all she needed.After throwing her sister and brother-in-law out of her modest apartment in a screaming rage, Margaret grabs her Oscar, buys a cheap bottle of hooch and takes a drunken ride through the streets of Beverly Hills, stopping briefly by her old mansion where she sorrowfully breaks down in tears.Davis looked like hell the morning after being bailed from jail by a former co-star (Sterling Hayden), who was miscast all over the place. She arrived home to find out that her key didn't fit anymore. She had been locked out for non-payment of rent. Defeated, now homeless, she tells Sterling Hayden, after he asks ""where to?"", ""isn't this the end of the line?""The papers are full of the scandal the next morning prompting Margaret to take advantage of the ""publicity"" as she storms into her agent's office and demands that he get her the role she's wanted to play for years in a script called ""The Fatal Winter"". ""But, what about the papers?"" the agent asks. She retorts, ""Joe Morrison is MAD about publicity!"" She is shocked when Morrison (the producer) wants her to play, not the lead, but the lead's older sister, Sara. Margaret is a STAR! So, she plots to get the lead by altering her screen test and playing Sara like a young siren so as to convince Morrison that he's made a mistake. The test is awful as played, but Davis, the actress was brilliant.In this role, Bette Davis does everything but hit the ceiling! She pops her eyes, bites her consonents, screams, yells, gets drunk, fights with the police, gets thrown in jail, has the screaming meanies, tells off a couple of old ladies, slaps faces and smokes cartons of cigarettes. Now, that's acting!When the Oscar nominations came out, Bette Davis was among the five nominees for ""best actress"" of 1952. Strange because Joan Crawford had been offered ""The Star"" and she turned it down flat. Davis had been offered ""Sudden Fear"" which she promptly refused. Bette had also been offered ""Come Back, Little Sheba"" but didn't feel the part was right for her, leaving Shirley Booth to repeat her stage success on screen. So, Bette accepted ""The Star"" and Joan grabbed ""Sudden Fear"". All three got nominated for the Academy Award! Booth won.In 1952, Bette Davis' career was on the skids. She, like Margaret Elliot, needed a juicy part to put her back on top. This role didn't do it, but it kept her working throughout the '50s with varying degrees of success. My favorite, besides ""The Star"" was ""The Catered Affair"" (1956).Despite the criticism I've read here of the film, I enjoyed it and it is an important part of my film collection.

She really didn't know how to be anything else BUT ""a star.""  The reality had already hit her when the film opens as she walks pass an auction where her personal belongings are being sold to pay creditors.There are so many incredible scenes and hardly any dull moments in this hardhitting script, that you could spend the rest of your life quoting ""Bette Davis lines.""  Take this one: ""You can do anything but get me a picture, can't you?  Harry Stone, the great big starmaker, the gentleman agent...MY friend...""  Or this one: ""Well, I've been running around in circles too, but NOT Margaret Elliot circles...I want you to take me STRAIGHT to Joe Morrison!""  Or this one: ""Take a good look, ladies. So there's no doubt, I AM Margaret Elliot and it IS a disgrace. MARGARET ELLIOT waiting on a couple of old bags like you!""There are so many more.  As I said in my other review, ""Bette Davis does everything but hit the ceiling"" in THE STAR. Her performance had Oscar written all over it.  Funny, if an actress today did one quarter of what Davis did here, she'd GET that Academy Award.  But, in 1952, the competition was much stiffer.

It is about a falling movie star (Bette Davis) who is getting older and who is falling out of favor with the public. However, internally she hasn't changed and she can't understand why everything around her is changing. After getting drunk one night and landing in jail, she begins staying with an ex-leading man who she helped into the industry. He helps her as much as he can, but only she can initiate change. The scene where she realizes what she has become is incredibly powerful and sad.The film is truly powerful. Although it is an age old story that gets pretty tired, all of the emotions in this film are real. Most of it is thanks to Bette Davis, a wonderful actress who thankfully never allowed herself to become a stagnant washup. It is said in the film that such a story could not have a sympathetic lead, but that the audience would only feel pity for her. Davis makes the role relatable and therefore empathetic, leading to a more powerful climax and ending.",5,What Goes Up Must Come Down,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,1020,"['Star', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'type', 'film', 'falling', 'movie', 'star', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'who', 'getting', 'older', 'who', 'falling', 'favor', 'public', 'However', 'internally', ""n't"", 'changed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'everything', 'changing', 'getting', 'drunk', 'one', 'night', 'landing', 'jail', 'staying', 'ex-leading', 'man', 'who', 'helped', 'industry', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'only', 'can', 'initiate', 'change', 'scene', 'where', 'what', 'become', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'sad.The', 'film', 'truly', 'powerful', 'age', 'old', 'story', 'pretty', 'tired', 'emotions', 'film', 'are', 'real', 'Most', 'thanks', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'who', 'thankfully', 'never', 'allowed', 'become', 'stagnant', 'washup', 'said', 'film', 'story', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'sympathetic', 'lead', 'audience', 'would', 'only', 'feel', 'pity', 'Davis', 'role', 'relatable', 'therefore', 'empathetic', 'leading', 'more', 'powerful', 'climax', 'ending']",N/A
308584,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302354145,Simon Davis,"[1, 1]","""The Star"", from 1952 stars movie legend Bette Davis in a stark and none too flattering portrayal of a washed actress desperatly trying to recapture her long lost stardon. This choice of role was in actual fact a brave move for Davis at this time as she was literally experiencing in real life what her movie character of Margaret Elliot goes through in the script. Having started the 1950's decade brilliantly as a free lance actress scoring a triumph in her Oscar nominated performance in the classic ""All About Eve"", Davis went into a rapid career decline after this and experienced a decade of work in non successful movies with plenty of telelvision work done to pay the bills. ""The Star"", despite being compared unfavourably to Davis' earlier triumph in the show biz themed ""All About Eve"", is an interesting and often starkly revealing effort that was one of the few bright spots in this dismal decade for Bette Davis.  Its central theme is sadly one that has proven all too real in the careers of countless celebrities over the decades who have enjoyed the glittering heights of movie stardom only to then experience a decline leading to heartbreak and tragedy in all its many forms. Despite its low budget and grainy harsh photography that in no way spares its leading actress ""The Star"", is a significant story that in a non compromising way illustrates a Hollywood none of us want to see. The story has it all from the breakdowns, to the tarnish beneath the glitter, to the tragedy of performers who are no longer ""Box Office"", and are thus just ""yesterday's news"" to the Hollywood Moguls and the paying public. Bette Davis like every other maturing actress in the early 1950's was experiencing some elements of this fictional story in their own careers and lives and thats what makes the film such a fascinating insight into the ugly side of what it means to be a ""Star"", in Hollywood's dream factory.",4,Stark Film Illustrating The Tragic Downsides Of Movie Stardom,1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,1913,"['Star', '1952', 'stars', 'movie', 'legend', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'stark', 'none', 'too', 'flattering', 'portrayal', 'washed', 'actress', 'desperatly', 'trying', 'recapture', 'long', 'lost', 'stardon', 'choice', 'role', 'was', 'actual', 'fact', 'brave', 'move', 'Davis', 'time', 'was', 'literally', 'experiencing', 'real', 'life', 'what', 'movie', 'character', 'Margaret', 'Elliot', 'script', 'Having', 'started', '1950', 'decade', 'brilliantly', 'free', 'lance', 'actress', 'scoring', 'triumph', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'classic', 'Eve', 'Davis', 'went', 'rapid', 'career', 'decline', 'experienced', 'decade', 'work', 'non', 'successful', 'movies', 'plenty', 'telelvision', 'work', 'done', 'pay', 'bills', 'Star', 'being', 'compared', 'unfavourably', 'Davis', 'earlier', 'triumph', 'show', 'biz', 'themed', 'Eve', 'interesting', 'often', 'starkly', 'revealing', 'effort', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'bright', 'spots', 'dismal', 'decade', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'central', 'theme', 'sadly', 'one', 'proven', 'too', 'real', 'careers', 'countless', 'celebrities', 'decades', 'who', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'glittering', 'heights', 'movie', 'stardom', 'only', 'then', 'experience', 'decline', 'leading', 'heartbreak', 'tragedy', 'many', 'forms', 'low', 'budget', 'grainy', 'harsh', 'photography', 'way', 'leading', 'actress', 'Star', 'significant', 'story', 'non', 'compromising', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'none', 'want', 'see', 'story', 'breakdowns', 'tarnish', 'beneath', 'glitter', 'tragedy', 'performers', 'who', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'Box', 'Office', 'are', 'thus', 'just', 'yesterday', 'news', 'Hollywood', 'Moguls', 'paying', 'public', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'other', 'maturing', 'actress', 'early', '1950', 'was', 'experiencing', 'elements', 'fictional', 'story', 'own', 'careers', 'lives', 'thats', 'what', 'film', 'fascinating', 'insight', 'ugly', 'side', 'what', 'be', 'Star', 'Hollywood', 'dream', 'factory']",N/A
