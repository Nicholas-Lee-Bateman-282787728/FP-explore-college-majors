Certainly, these are funny ladies worthy of recognition.The clips are on the short side, and the documentary runs for little more than an hour. The extras are somewhat interesting extended interviews that in some cases duplicate what's in the documentary.So, all in all, a DVD worth renting for a few chuckles, but not one most of us will want to buy for repeated viewings. By the way, almost all of the shows highlighted in this documentary are on DVD, so if you own those sets, then there's little reason to pick this up.",3,Enjoyable -- once,1099008000,"10 29, 2004",2004,603,"['well-done', 'pleasant', 'entertainment', 'revelatory', 'insights', 'Certainly', 'are', 'funny', 'ladies', 'recognition.The', 'clips', 'are', 'short', 'side', 'documentary', 'runs', 'little', 'more', 'hour', 'extras', 'are', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'extended', 'interviews', 'cases', 'duplicate', 'what', 'documentary.So', 'DVD', 'worth', 'renting', 'few', 'chuckles', 'not', 'one', 'most', 'will', 'want', 'buy', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'way', 'almost', 'shows', 'highlighted', 'documentary', 'are', 'DVD', 'so', 'own', 'sets', 'then', 'little', 'reason', 'pick', 'up']",The Funny Ladies of British Comedy

832752,A1WX1MQH4ELIAI,B0002F6BRY,Timothy S. Mcpherson,"[9, 9]","The Funny Ladies has to be one of the best way to get to see your favorite actress in the their personal self, away from the the characters they play so well. In interviews talking about their roles or about other actress the this dvd. For someone living outside of England you don't see these ladies in the news or on talk show much at all. I see this as a step closer to more about the actresses. How they felt about the part they played or how see them selves in roles. It gives a more personal touch I think.Other reviews where saying that the Clips are short. But i really don't see that a problem. The clips showing on this dvd is to show what they are talking about to keep the viewer with the actress. Some of the clips I have the whole set from several shows. I really didn't expect to show a good chunk of an episode.This is a good buy as i got for 2.99. cant really go wrong their. But only one minor thing i had is they don't tell all the actress growing up Stories. But it's really no big deal to me. My main concern was the interviews and they did a good job.Also has Extended interviews in the special features. A plus for anyone want to know more about their Favorite Actresses. As for mine are Patricia Routleade, Mollie Sugden, and Dame Judi Dench.",5,A good peek into you Favorite actress.,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,1266,"['Funny', 'Ladies', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'way', 'get', 'see', 'favorite', 'actress', 'personal', 'self', 'away', 'characters', 'play', 'so', 'well', 'interviews', 'talking', 'roles', 'other', 'actress', 'dvd', 'someone', 'living', 'England', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'ladies', 'news', 'talk', 'show', 'much', 'see', 'step', 'closer', 'more', 'actresses', 'How', 'felt', 'part', 'played', 'how', 'see', 'selves', 'roles', 'more', 'personal', 'touch', 'think.Other', 'reviews', 'where', 'saying', 'Clips', 'are', 'short', 'i', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'problem', 'clips', 'showing', 'dvd', 'show', 'what', 'are', 'talking', 'keep', 'viewer', 'actress', 'clips', 'have', 'whole', 'set', 'several', 'shows', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'show', 'good', 'chunk', 'episode.This', 'good', 'buy', 'i', 'got', '2.99.', 'cant', 'really', 'go', 'wrong', 'only', 'one', 'minor', 'thing', 'i', 'had', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'actress', 'growing', 'up', 'Stories', 'really', 'big', 'deal', 'main', 'concern', 'was', 'interviews', 'did', 'good', 'job.Also', 'Extended', 'interviews', 'special', 'features', 'plus', 'anyone', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'Favorite', 'Actresses', 'mine', 'are', 'Patricia', 'Routleade', 'Mollie', 'Sugden', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench']",The Funny Ladies of British Comedy
