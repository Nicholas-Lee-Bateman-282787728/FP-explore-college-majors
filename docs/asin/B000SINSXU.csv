1086231,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B000SINSXU,Caleb Williams,"[16, 19]","The Young Ones was an alternative sitcom that truly changed the way people looked at comedy and the traditional sitcom. It was the true anarchist of TV released at a time when the working classes were close to embarking on a full blown revolution against Thatcher's Britain. The show combined a number of different formats; traditional sitcom, violent slapstick and surrealism to make what some would consider truly bizarre but utterly brilliant. The creation of Rik Mayall, Ben Elton and Lise Mayer this has fast become one of the most well loved sitcoms in BBC history.Focusing around 4 very different students, The Young Ones each represent the main stereotypes of Thatcherite Britain. Vyvyan (Ade Edmondson), the punk who hates everything authoritarian but reveals a more contradictory side to the tough guy persona. Rick (Rik Mayall), the annoyingly leftist goody two shoes who claims to be against authority until he's faced with it and also, being a massive Cliff Richard fan makes him twice as annoying. Neil (Nigel Planer), the depressed hippy who just talks about love and peace yet doesn't stop going on about how he wants to kill himself.  Mike (Christopher Ryan), the gangster of the group who considers himself very much the leader of the group and a bit of a ladies man. Alexei Sayle (Jerzy Balowski), the unpredictable landlord of the boys who comes in and takes on many different tasks that annoy his tenants.There are many reasons for this programmes success. One is the unique comedy contained within but the other is the plethora of comic minds involved, not just as part of the writing team but those in front of the camera too. At the time of its release, each of the comedians was at the start of their character acting/comedy careers and were really looking to make names for themselves. I can't imagine that they would have believed this show to be as successful as it has become and how, even now, it can still be watched and enjoyed as much as it was when it first debuted.I pointed out the surrealism aspect of the sitcom and this is really what makes it stand out from all the other sitcoms of that time. It's not just the basic sitcom of gag after gag. After a particular scene with the group, the camera will pan out to a completely bizarre scene that relates to what went on with the real cast. For example, in the episode ""Boring"", Alexei Sayle's character drinks water from a goldfish bowl and the scene will then turn to the insides of his stomach. We see the fish in the stomach talking to another piece of food about its appearance in the next James Bond film. This type of random addition really allows the creators of the show to experiment and can, in a way, relate itself to the Monty Python series as there was a lot of experimentation with the comedy.Another great addition to the show is its adding of live band performances for the in-house audience and of course the audience at home. The acts are fit within the script of the show, so it's not as if the bands just come out of nowhere, but that is another fine example of what places this above the others in the case of originality. Although it's only a short lived show, lasting only for 2 series, I'm quite glad they didn't try to drag it out to a third or fourth series as it would have truly allowed the show to die a sore death. The amount of celebrity guests are another great addition with people such as Stephen Fry and French & Saunders plus many others. To those who like the bizarre and really enjoy a good laugh, then this is really the show for you.",5,Genius,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,3560,"['Young', 'Ones', 'was', 'alternative', 'sitcom', 'truly', 'changed', 'way', 'people', 'looked', 'comedy', 'traditional', 'sitcom', 'was', 'true', 'anarchist', 'TV', 'released', 'time', 'when', 'working', 'classes', 'were', 'close', 'embarking', 'full', 'blown', 'revolution', 'Thatcher', 'Britain', 'show', 'combined', 'number', 'different', 'formats', 'traditional', 'sitcom', 'violent', 'slapstick', 'surrealism', 'make', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'creation', 'Rik', 'Mayall', 'Ben', 'Elton', 'Lise', 'Mayer', 'fast', 'one', 'most', 'well', 'loved', 'sitcoms', 'BBC', 'history.Focusing', 'around', '4', 'very', 'different', 'students', 'Young', 'Ones', 'represent', 'main', 'stereotypes', 'Thatcherite', 'Britain', 'Vyvyan', 'Ade', 'Edmondson', 'punk', 'who', 'everything', 'authoritarian', 'more', 'contradictory', 'side', 'tough', 'guy', 'persona', 'Rick', 'Rik', 'Mayall', 'annoyingly', 'leftist', 'goody', 'two', 'shoes', 'who', 'be', 'authority', 'faced', 'also', 'being', 'massive', 'Cliff', 'Richard', 'fan', 'twice', 'annoying', 'Neil', 'Nigel', 'Planer', 'depressed', 'hippy', 'who', 'just', 'talks', 'love', 'peace', 'yet', ""n't"", 'stop', 'going', 'how', 'kill', 'Mike', 'Christopher', 'Ryan', 'gangster', 'group', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'leader', 'group', 'bit', 'ladies', 'man', 'Alexei', 'Sayle', 'Jerzy', 'Balowski', 'unpredictable', 'landlord', 'boys', 'who', 'many', 'different', 'tasks', 'annoy', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'success', 'One', 'unique', 'comedy', 'contained', 'other', 'plethora', 'comic', 'minds', 'involved', 'not', 'just', 'part', 'writing', 'team', 'front', 'camera', 'too', 'time', 'release', 'comedians', 'was', 'start', 'character', 'acting/comedy', 'careers', 'were', 'really', 'looking', 'make', 'names', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'would', 'have', 'believed', 'show', 'be', 'as', 'successful', 'become', 'how', 'even', 'now', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'debuted.I', 'pointed', 'out', 'surrealism', 'aspect', 'sitcom', 'really', 'what', 'stand', 'out', 'other', 'sitcoms', 'time', 'not', 'just', 'basic', 'sitcom', 'gag', 'gag', 'particular', 'scene', 'group', 'camera', 'will', 'pan', 'out', 'completely', 'bizarre', 'scene', 'what', 'went', 'real', 'cast', 'example', 'episode', 'Boring', 'Alexei', 'Sayle', 'character', 'drinks', 'water', 'goldfish', 'bowl', 'scene', 'will', 'then', 'turn', 'insides', 'stomach', 'see', 'fish', 'stomach', 'talking', 'piece', 'food', 'appearance', 'next', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'type', 'random', 'addition', 'really', 'creators', 'show', 'experiment', 'can', 'way', 'relate', 'Monty', 'Python', 'series', 'was', 'lot', 'experimentation', 'comedy.Another', 'great', 'addition', 'show', 'adding', 'live', 'band', 'performances', 'in-house', 'audience', 'course', 'audience', 'home', 'acts', 'are', 'fit', 'script', 'show', 'not', 'bands', 'just', 'come', 'nowhere', 'fine', 'example', 'what', 'others', 'case', 'originality', 'only', 'short', 'lived', 'show', 'lasting', 'only', '2', 'series', ""'m"", 'quite', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'drag', 'out', 'third', 'fourth', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'truly', 'allowed', 'show', 'die', 'sore', 'death', 'amount', 'celebrity', 'guests', 'are', 'great', 'addition', 'people', 'such', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'French', 'Saunders', 'many', 'others', 'who', 'like', 'bizarre', 'really', 'enjoy', 'good', 'laugh', 'then', 'really', 'show']",The Young Ones: Extra Stoopid Edition

Amazon kindly replaced the whole set when the first DVD would not play in two different DVD players; but again when I opened the second replacement item I found the first DVD heavily marked making it unable to play properly due to multiple picture/audio-freezes. Contacting BBC Worldwide Americas Inc. for a replacement disc is useless as I've spoken to them twice already: they are polite on the phone but won't do anything to correct the problem with this shoddy product. Today I will try contacting Warner Home Video Inc. who is the U. S. distributor before contacting Amazon about a refund. It would seem that this entire DVD is run is defective and I give the consumer the highest warning possible not to purchase this item from any seller for that reason. My only regret (other than having purchased this item) is that I am unable rate this product at zero stars.
