The acting is mediocre at best. The film is mildly entertaining. Scott is at odds with her sister, who holds Scott responsible for their father's death. As soon as the sister announced her plans for going on a camping trip in the woods, I knew exactly what was going to happen. You will too. The plot is predictable. So is the syrupy-sweet ending.If you're in the mood for a mild movie-of-the-week type flick that takes no thought or concentration, go for it. Otherwise don't bother. It's like eating soup when you really want meat and potatoes.",2,Bombed for me,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,680,"['proving', 'as', 'strong', 'man', '128', 'lb.', 'former', 'firefighter', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Burns', 'hired', 'smoke', 'jumper', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'best', 'film', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'Scott', 'odds', 'sister', 'who', 'Scott', 'responsible', 'father', 'death', 'As', 'soon', 'sister', 'announced', 'plans', 'going', 'camping', 'trip', 'woods', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'will', 'too', 'plot', 'predictable', 'syrupy-sweet', 'ending.If', ""'re"", 'mood', 'mild', 'movie-of-the-week', 'type', 'flick', 'thought', 'concentration', 'go', 'Otherwise', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'eating', 'soup', 'when', 'really', 'want', 'meat', 'potatoes']",Smoke Jumper

1202597,A19QFPITR2N8M9,B001HY3B36,Nelson E. Donley,"[3, 3]","This movie was so bad that I never finished watching it. If you think ""Independence Day"" and ""Rambo"" are great movies, you will probably disagree with me. I would only recommend this movie to a teenager, never to a grown-up.The plot is both predictable and commonplace from the very beginning. A young woman wants to avenge her father's death by becoming a smoke jumper. Her father died when he rushed into a burning house to rescue a child on the day of his retirement. She made it out alive with the child, but her dad got hit by a burning beam and died.Daughter Kristin is a 128 lb. wannabe fireman. She is somehow able to pass a physical agility test that would challenge a strong, male athlete. For example, she has to carry 100 lb. for 1 mile in under 11 minutes among other things.Kristin becomes transformed into a wonder woman! She becomes the Navy Seal of fighter fighters. She is fearless, commanding, faster than a speeding bullet and able to bend steel in her bare hands. That's the ridiculous impress you get while watching this horrendous film.The script is bad. The acting is bad. The music is annoying. ""Smoke Jumper"" may not be and Ed Wood film, but it's very close. If you have a room temperature IQ or believe in Amazon women, this is truly a film for you. Some movies pound sand. This movie goes one step further-- it pounds smoke.",1,A Smoke Pounding Film,1316736000,"09 23, 2011",2011,1352,"['movie', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'never', 'finished', 'watching', 'think', 'Independence', 'Day', 'Rambo', 'are', 'great', 'movies', 'will', 'probably', 'disagree', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'movie', 'teenager', 'never', 'grown-up.The', 'plot', 'predictable', 'commonplace', 'very', 'beginning', 'young', 'woman', 'avenge', 'father', 'death', 'becoming', 'smoke', 'jumper', 'father', 'died', 'when', 'rushed', 'burning', 'house', 'rescue', 'child', 'day', 'retirement', 'made', 'out', 'alive', 'child', 'dad', 'got', 'hit', 'burning', 'beam', 'died.Daughter', 'Kristin', '128', 'lb', 'wannabe', 'fireman', 'somehow', 'able', 'pass', 'physical', 'agility', 'test', 'would', 'challenge', 'strong', 'male', 'athlete', 'example', 'carry', '100', 'lb', '1', 'mile', '11', 'minutes', 'other', 'things.Kristin', 'transformed', 'wonder', 'woman', 'Navy', 'Seal', 'fighter', 'fighters', 'fearless', 'commanding', 'faster', 'speeding', 'bullet', 'able', 'bend', 'steel', 'bare', 'hands', 'ridiculous', 'impress', 'get', 'watching', 'horrendous', 'film.The', 'script', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'music', 'annoying', 'Smoke', 'Jumper', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'film', 'very', 'close', 'have', 'room', 'temperature', 'IQ', 'believe', 'Amazon', 'women', 'truly', 'film', 'movies', 'pound', 'sand', 'movie', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'smoke']",Smoke Jumper

1202599,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B001HY3B36,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","The opening starts with a forest fire and reporters. Brooke Burns (no pun intended) plays a fire fighter, whose dad is the captain. As always the reporters covering the job can't walk and chew gum at the same time. One passes out from smoke inhalation while another falls down and breaks his leg. Firemen get separated in the woods and can't contact each other because they don't have radios for Rawlings company #1 in Idaho.Dad is due to retire. He stayed a firefighter and extra year just for Kristin (Brooke) and goes to work his last day instead of staying home, invoking the wrath of the bad luck fire god. They get a call and him and Kristen enter a burning home to rescue a boy. Kristen saves the boy, but dad, who got hit by a falling beam, is still in the house! She attempts to go back into the home, but is prevented by fellow fire fighters who also don't have a back-up team. Kristen is blamed for her father's death by her fellow fire fighters and even her own sister. Mom, a 21st century version of June Cleaver, is supportive of her. So during her suspension she tries out for the ""Smoke Jumpers"" the SEALS 6 of fire fighters. She finds out she doesn't meet the weight requirement and must put on weight to join, apparently living in a world with no fast food chains. Kristin completes the smoke jumper boot camp and makes the team.The smoke jumpers enter the plane walking in slow motion with swagger music that makes them look like astronauts. Her sister and family decide to go camping in the woods, a group of seasoned smoke jumpers burn up in a blaze, Rawlings #1 is called to the scene and rookie smoke jumper Bambi Kristen is on the job.....and you know the rest. The acting was somewhere between an after school special and a bad soap opera. When the main problem becomes firemen having to rescue fireman then someone is not doing their job.
