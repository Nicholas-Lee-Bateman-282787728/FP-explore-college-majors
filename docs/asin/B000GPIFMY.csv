1006012,A96C98SCPMWLH,B000GPIFMY,Almost Sixty!,"[5, 5]","Along with superb music and vocal blending by the GVB, this DVD provides a personal introduction to the two newest memebers of the GVB and their families. Their interaction is delightful (be sure to watch the bonus material and the singing in the shower recordings). It is obvious that these guys love to be together and are in sync with each other. Being a Hoosier, I enjoyed the segments from St. Elmo Steak House and Conseco Fieldhouse. This DVD was taped before an audience of GVB and Homecoming singers and their families, as well as a few special guests whose contributions were recognized. The setting provided a unique dynamic for the singers, resulting in an excitement that is contagious.",5,My new favorite Gaither Vocal Band DVD,1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,698,"['superb', 'music', 'vocal', 'blending', 'GVB', 'DVD', 'personal', 'introduction', 'two', 'newest', 'memebers', 'GVB', 'families', 'interaction', 'delightful', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'bonus', 'material', 'singing', 'shower', 'recordings', 'obvious', 'guys', 'love', 'be', 'together', 'are', 'sync', 'other', 'Being', 'Hoosier', 'enjoyed', 'segments', 'St.', 'Elmo', 'Steak', 'House', 'Conseco', 'Fieldhouse', 'DVD', 'was', 'taped', 'audience', 'GVB', 'Homecoming', 'singers', 'families', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'special', 'guests', 'contributions', 'were', 'recognized', 'setting', 'provided', 'unique', 'dynamic', 'singers', 'resulting', 'excitement', 'contagious']",N/A

I love Marshall Hall's solo ""Jesus Love Me""/  Wes does such a good job on his solo too.  It was nice that Bill was able to introduce Gordon Stoker one of the original Jordonaires who appreciated Wes's singing as much as I did.  It was nice to meet the wives of these talented men and see them laughing and having a good time together with Gordon Mote and His wife.  Of course, I enjoyed hearing Ernie Haase and Signature Sound and was glad that BIll introduced George Younce's family.  I love every song on this DVD but Glorious Impossible and Worthy the Lamb are my favorites. It was good to see these four men get so emotional about their singing and to actually break down while trying to sing.  You could tell the music was really touching them as much as it was touching me. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who LOVES good Gospel Music.",4,Give It Away,1305331200,"05 14, 2011",2011,906,"['love', 'Gaither', 'Vocal', 'Band', 'Especially', 'four', 'guys', 'love', 'Marshall', 'Hall', 'solo', 'Jesus', 'Love', 'Me', '/', 'Wes', 'good', 'job', 'solo', 'too', 'was', 'nice', 'Bill', 'was', 'able', 'introduce', 'Gordon', 'Stoker', 'one', 'original', 'Jordonaires', 'who', 'appreciated', 'Wes', 'singing', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'was', 'nice', 'meet', 'wives', 'talented', 'men', 'see', 'laughing', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'together', 'Gordon', 'Mote', 'wife', 'course', 'enjoyed', 'hearing', 'Ernie', 'Haase', 'Signature', 'Sound', 'was', 'glad', 'BIll', 'introduced', 'George', 'Younce', 'family', 'love', 'song', 'DVD', 'Glorious', 'Impossible', 'Worthy', 'Lamb', 'are', 'favorites', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'four', 'men', 'get', 'so', 'emotional', 'singing', 'actually', 'break', 'down', 'trying', 'sing', 'could', 'tell', 'music', 'was', 'really', 'touching', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'touching', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'LOVES', 'good', 'Gospel', 'Music']",N/A

I did not enjoy this project as much as I did Everything Good, the last one with David Phelps. Maybe because I am an older generation, I don't like my music quite so jazzy sounding as this was.

Filmed at a dinner theater in Indianapolis, the atmosphere is so relaxed and perfect. The beautiful voices of Ernie Hass and  Signature Sound add to the beautiful sounds. The rich smooth voice of Guy Penrod makes so many of these songs just give me goosebumps. Getting to meet family members of the singers is wonderful too, especially piano player Gordon Mote and his beautiful wife.
