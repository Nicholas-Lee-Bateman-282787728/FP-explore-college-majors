Good lord, I wasn't expecting it to be a great movie by any leap of the imagination, but even for b-movie cannon fodder, it sucked harshly and long.First of all, the female lead had to play the stupidest law enforcement agent in the history of mankind. I swear, there is literally a scene where she hears a noise in bushes around her house (at night no less!) and instead of drawing her weapon, stupid creeps around in the dark with no light saying ""Hello? Is anyone there?"" I know movies require suspension of disbelief, and I certainly wouldn't expect her to go blasting away at the bushes like John McClain on a four shot espresso bender, but come on. Seriously.And she was absolutely useless. She had to be bailed out of ever bad situation by all the men in the movie. And yes, it does prick my feminist side deeply, I'll admit that first up, but she's supposed to be a police officer. Looking cute in your uniform is not all it takes to be a good cop.Not to mention the whole 'serial killer' angle was a complete wash-out. I've seen highschoolers write more compelling scripts that weren't half as trite or cliched. This movie was the fuzz that grows on crap after its been left out in the pasture after a hard rain.

It takes itself too seriously and focuses too much of its time on an adulterous couple, and on shoddy detective work.B-movie legends Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator) and Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes; The Devils Rejects) both star, but they turn in disappointing performances. Perhaps its because both of their characters are so badly written.However, Brutal does have a few bloody good deaths, and I've seen worse.

1071228,AQMZ9N7NAIPC,B000PHVY4E,"E. Selvia ""Liz""","[0, 0]","First off, even though this film certainly isn't &#34;Hostel&#34; it's still actually quite good. To be honest, it doesn't really fall solidly into the horror genre. It's really more of a horror-drama, if such a thing can be said to exist (not a bad concept if you ask me). Without too many spoilers, the story centers on the life of a young police woman who has experienced her number of personal difficulties already when the story begins. The villain is certainly fairly believable from a more realistic perspective (not the frothing, red eyed monster some were hoping for) but certainly no less vicious or frightening. Some times real life can be scarier than anything in the movies. That being said, throughout the story we watch the young woman go through the process of becoming a stronger, far happier human being. To me, that is worth the price of the movie. Of course, if all you are looking for is simply a blood spattered gore-fest, admittedly, this film may leave you wanting. I would actually recommend this film to female fans of horror because it does not patronize, belittle or stereotype the heroine. She is shown as capable, intelligent, sensitive and truly courageous. By the end of the film, she faces her personal difficulties with poise, bravery and compassion. In fact, it was such a unique experience that I gave the film an extra star.Say what you will, this is not a bad movie (albeit perhaps before a more openminded audience).",4,Not Your Average Slasher Flick,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,1455,"['First', 'off', 'even', 'film', 'certainly', ""n't"", '34', 'Hostel', '34', 'still', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'be', 'honest', ""n't"", 'really', 'fall', 'solidly', 'horror', 'genre', 'really', 'more', 'horror-drama', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'exist', 'not', 'bad', 'concept', 'ask', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', 'story', 'centers', 'life', 'young', 'police', 'woman', 'who', 'experienced', 'number', 'personal', 'difficulties', 'already', 'when', 'story', 'villain', 'certainly', 'fairly', 'believable', 'more', 'realistic', 'perspective', 'not', 'frothing', 'red', 'eyed', 'monster', 'were', 'hoping', 'certainly', 'no', 'less', 'vicious', 'frightening', 'times', 'real', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'scarier', 'anything', 'movies', 'being', 'said', 'story', 'watch', 'young', 'woman', 'go', 'process', 'becoming', 'stronger', 'far', 'happier', 'human', 'being', 'price', 'movie', 'course', 'are', 'looking', 'simply', 'blood', 'spattered', 'gore-fest', 'admittedly', 'film', 'may', 'leave', 'wanting', 'would', 'actually', 'recommend', 'film', 'female', 'fans', 'horror', 'not', 'patronize', 'belittle', 'stereotype', 'heroine', 'shown', 'capable', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'truly', 'courageous', 'end', 'film', 'personal', 'difficulties', 'poise', 'bravery', 'compassion', 'fact', 'was', 'such', 'unique', 'experience', 'gave', 'film', 'extra', 'star.Say', 'what', 'will', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'more', 'openminded', 'audience']",Brutal

1071231,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000PHVY4E,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Brutal (Ethan Wiley, 2007)Wiley (House II) wrote, produced, and directed this straight-to-video standard slasher schlock that's only notable for its surprisingly fine cast. Jeffrey Combs (ReAnimator) plays Jimmy Fleck, a small-town sheriff who's married to the local councilman's daughter but getting some on the side with his hot deputy Zoe (Sarah Thomson of Cruel Intentions II). When a serial killer starts operating in the town, Jimmy seems less than concerned about things, and his half-hearted efforts to find the killer lead Zoe to Leroy Calhoun (The Hills Have Eyes' Michael Berryman, one of America's more underrated talents), an autistic man who raises bloodhounds. Can Zoe uncover the killer's identity before he gets around to killing her (because, after all, small towns have a finite supply of nubile young women)?It's stupid, but unintentionally funny in a number of places, and any chance one gets to see Michael Berryman on the screen should be eagerly accepted. (Thankfully, his career is in the middle of a renaissance right now thanks to The Devil's Rejects, and I couldn't be happier.) But the real prize here is Jeffrey Combs, who for what seems like the first time isn't in a role where he's parodying Herbert West. Hey, the guy can actually do something else! Honest to Pete!Still, though, if Combs, Berryman, and a seemingly endless parade of hot chicks isn't enough to keep you interested, then pass on this one. The plot is cookie-cutter, the script boneheaded, the direction uninspired. There are actually Sci-Fi Channel Original Movies you'll have more fun with, and that's saying something. * ",1,Brutal-ly bad.,1227052800,"11 19, 2008",2008,1623,"['Brutal', 'Ethan', 'Wiley', '2007', 'Wiley', 'House', 'II', 'wrote', 'produced', 'directed', 'straight-to-video', 'standard', 'slasher', 'schlock', 'only', 'notable', 'surprisingly', 'fine', 'cast', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'ReAnimator', 'Jimmy', 'Fleck', 'small-town', 'sheriff', 'who', 'married', 'local', 'councilman', 'daughter', 'getting', 'side', 'hot', 'deputy', 'Zoe', 'Sarah', 'Thomson', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'II', 'When', 'serial', 'killer', 'operating', 'town', 'Jimmy', 'less', 'concerned', 'things', 'half-hearted', 'efforts', 'find', 'killer', 'lead', 'Zoe', 'Leroy', 'Calhoun', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'Michael', 'Berryman', 'one', 'America', 'more', 'underrated', 'talents', 'autistic', 'man', 'who', 'bloodhounds', 'Can', 'Zoe', 'killer', 'identity', 'around', 'killing', 'small', 'towns', 'have', 'finite', 'supply', 'nubile', 'young', 'women', 'stupid', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'number', 'places', 'chance', 'one', 'see', 'Michael', 'Berryman', 'screen', 'should', 'be', 'eagerly', 'accepted', 'Thankfully', 'career', 'middle', 'renaissance', 'right', 'now', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'real', 'prize', 'here', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'who', 'what', 'first', 'time', ""n't"", 'role', 'where', 'parodying', 'Herbert', 'West', 'Hey', 'guy', 'can', 'actually', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'Honest', 'Pete', 'Still', 'though', 'Combs', 'Berryman', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'parade', 'hot', 'chicks', ""n't"", 'enough', 'keep', 'interested', 'then', 'pass', 'one', 'plot', 'cookie-cutter', 'script', 'boneheaded', 'direction', 'uninspired', 'are', 'actually', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'Original', 'Movies', ""'ll"", 'have', 'more', 'fun', 'saying', 'something', '*']",Brutal
