1025169,AQUU8S55JGY2H,B000J4QWM2,Aco,"[1, 3]","As another Michael Mann and Miami Vice TV lover, my initial response to this was disgust. The fact that they didn't use the opening theme alone was too bad, but the missed opportunity to revisit the 80's and then the casting of Farrell kept me out of the theatre.But thanks to On Demand cable, and the knowledge that a Director's Cut is available too, I figured to see this, then the Cut and compare.Ultimately I am amongst the disappointed, but not for lack of certain appreciation. Mann is a master of movement, and like few directors can unify style with grace and substance. He also uses wonderfully exhilarating music. I am a sucker for this skill, and when he uses it here, I enjoyed the film. The supporting cast, Luis Tosar as Jesus Montoya and John Ortiz as Jose Yero were standouts. There is also some very impressive masculine hair (beards, goatees, burns, etc.) in this.Otherwise, it lacked in many ways. The Gong Li subplot was terrible. The lack of relationship between Farrell and Foxx angered. Then messy accents and inadible dialogue confused.In ending, Mann's m.o. of ""Leave now, life is short, time is luck,"" gets sucked away by Farrell and Li's foolish relationship. Mann's heroes are loners and operate within certain codes. Here Crockett ignores these codes, thus the pride and thrill of Crockett and Tubbs and their vice crew's bond (what made the TV series cool and quirky-remember the van with the bug on top?) is nonexistent.I really give it 2.5 stars, but round up for Mann.",3,"Leave now, life is short, time is luck",1183766400,"07 7, 2007",2007,1501,"['Michael', 'Mann', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'TV', 'lover', 'initial', 'response', 'was', 'disgust', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'opening', 'theme', 'alone', 'was', 'too', 'bad', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'revisit', '80', 'then', 'casting', 'Farrell', 'kept', 'theatre.But', 'thanks', 'Demand', 'cable', 'knowledge', 'Director', 'Cut', 'available', 'too', 'figured', 'see', 'then', 'Cut', 'compare.Ultimately', 'am', 'amongst', 'disappointed', 'not', 'lack', 'certain', 'appreciation', 'Mann', 'master', 'movement', 'few', 'directors', 'can', 'unify', 'style', 'grace', 'substance', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'exhilarating', 'music', 'am', 'sucker', 'skill', 'when', 'here', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Luis', 'Tosar', 'Jesus', 'Montoya', 'John', 'Ortiz', 'Jose', 'Yero', 'were', 'standouts', 'also', 'very', 'impressive', 'masculine', 'hair', 'beards', 'goatees', 'burns', 'etc', 'this.Otherwise', 'lacked', 'many', 'ways', 'Gong', 'Li', 'subplot', 'was', 'terrible', 'lack', 'relationship', 'Farrell', 'Foxx', 'angered', 'Then', 'messy', 'accents', 'inadible', 'dialogue', 'confused.In', 'ending', 'Mann', 'm.o', 'Leave', 'now', 'life', 'short', 'time', 'luck', 'sucked', 'away', 'Farrell', 'Li', 'foolish', 'relationship', 'Mann', 'heroes', 'are', 'loners', 'operate', 'certain', 'codes', 'Here', 'Crockett', 'codes', 'thus', 'pride', 'thrill', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'vice', 'crew', 'bond', 'what', 'made', 'TV', 'series', 'cool', 'quirky-remember', 'van', 'bug', 'top', 'nonexistent.I', 'really', 'give', '2.5', 'stars', 'round', 'up', 'Mann']",N/A

Jamie Foxx, on the other hand has proved himself in the past to be a good actor.  In this movie he's not.  Perhaps it's the directing, poor script or teaming up with Farrell; but he comes off as very one dimensional in his performance.  The supporting cast does not fare much better.In fact if it weren't the graphic violence, this movie could become quite campy because everything and everyone takes themselves sooo seriously.  I think the film makers had every intention that they were making a profound film that would change lives and uncover the dark side of Miami Vice- the problem is, they didn't check to see if anyone would care that much to see such [...].Miami Vice was a pretty good show in its day.  At times more a cultural phenomenon than actual quality, but you could always find something entertaining- even in its kitsch.

Most know the guy can direct visual - this film is eye popping in its various locations and the shots are framed with beautiful detail. Too bad that Mann losses interest in the writting of characters. Gone is the dark humor of the series, the real sense of friendship you can feel between the two main leads, and the sense of dread you have when all the odds seem stacked against the good guys.At least the small lady parts are handled well - Gong Li even brings a sense power and grace to the cliched Femme Fatal / Lost soul part she is stuck with and the camera loves her beauty.  Strange how the ""Tubbs"" character shows intelligence while the ""Sonny"" character is almost a complete bore.  Give credit to Jamie on making something out of nothing - even if the director has him introduce his lady to the Bad Guy, One of the all time Stupid Moves an Undercover Agent could ever do!The movie than losses all sense of wrapping up its plot lines (who is the leak, what happens to the main villian, ???) so it can focus on the love life of the 2 main leads?  Mann only has one exciting action scene and even that comes no where near the shoot-out of all shoot-outs that him filmed in ""Heat"".  Lets hope Mann gets some ""no people"" around him and a script manager so he get back on his game and make a crime drama worthy of his visual talents.",2,what could have been,1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,1400,"['Sad', 'sad', 'Mann', 'ball', 'writing', 'movie', 'Most', 'know', 'guy', 'can', 'direct', 'visual', 'film', 'eye', 'popping', 'various', 'locations', 'shots', 'are', 'framed', 'beautiful', 'detail', 'Too', 'bad', 'Mann', 'losses', 'interest', 'writting', 'characters', 'Gone', 'dark', 'humor', 'series', 'real', 'sense', 'friendship', 'can', 'feel', 'two', 'main', 'leads', 'sense', 'dread', 'have', 'when', 'odds', 'seem', 'stacked', 'good', 'guys.At', 'least', 'small', 'lady', 'parts', 'are', 'handled', 'well', 'Gong', 'Li', 'even', 'sense', 'power', 'grace', 'cliched', 'Femme', 'Fatal', '/', 'Lost', 'soul', 'part', 'stuck', 'camera', 'beauty', 'Strange', 'how', 'Tubbs', 'character', 'shows', 'intelligence', 'Sonny', 'character', 'almost', 'complete', 'bore', 'Give', 'credit', 'Jamie', 'making', 'something', 'nothing', 'even', 'director', 'introduce', 'lady', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'One', 'time', 'Stupid', 'Undercover', 'Agent', 'could', 'ever', 'do', 'movie', 'losses', 'sense', 'wrapping', 'up', 'plot', 'lines', 'who', 'leak', 'what', 'main', 'villian', 'can', 'focus', 'love', 'life', '2', 'main', 'leads', 'Mann', 'only', 'one', 'exciting', 'action', 'scene', 'even', 'where', 'shoot-out', 'shoot-outs', 'filmed', 'Heat', 'Lets', 'hope', 'Mann', 'people', 'script', 'manager', 'get', 'back', 'game', 'make', 'crime', 'drama', 'worthy', 'visual', 'talents']",N/A

And I particularly enjoy his style; I'm not sure if I'm right, but he seems to shoot a lot with handheld cameras and natural light (as opposed to well lit scenes w/ artificial lights).  It makes for a very distinctive feel that I enjoy.  This movie is in that vein, but with some challenges.  The overall story is pretty decent, and certainly consistent with the brazenly neon miami vice of yesterday.  The problem is the dialog and lines.  A lot of it is incredibly artificial and downright awful.  I actually laughed quite a few times in the theater while listening to colin farrell's lines.  I surprised myself and bought the dvd, only to realize that i really enjoy a select few scenes.

But it's different, it's really good.Time moved on guys.This is the third time I watched the movie. It is a Michael Mann film, meaning it's perfect. Terrific script, great action, beautiful music, wonderful acting, perfect frames.Just don't start comparing. Trust Michael Mann's professionalism. After all he's done Collateral, Heat, etc.etc. (and of course produced the original series) He knows what he's doing.Both Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx do a great job. I have to admit I was never a real fan of the series. It was too much of a show, too entertaining for my taste. Crime and crime solving was as much fun as sipping rum by the pool watching the bikinis show off. I think that's wrong. Crime is wrong, dark and dirty. Going undercover, trying to stop things from getting worse is one of the most dangerous professions on earth, deserving our utmost respect. That's what needs to be transmitted. Michael Mann does a great job here. O.k., it's fiction and stylish, nothing like The Corner, but it's soooo good. Keeps you on the edge of your seat for the full 140 minutes.The story is not very complicated. An undercover drug deal goes wrong. Crockett and Tubbs decide to take over and finish off the bad guys. It takes them about two hours. Don't worry, it's a wild ride, and they need every minute of it. Colin is ever as slick as Don Johnson - a much better voice! Jamie is much tougher than Philip Michael Thomas and it's good that he is. After all, as I said, this is not a pool party, this is a very dark story on an undercover job to stop one of the baddest Columbians around. There is a second storyline, Colin falling in love with the top gangster's wife. It's convincing and Colin does a great job in showing his doubts about his choices - even in the close-ups.On the HD DVD transfer. It's extremely good. I've watched it with a friend on a huge screen.

1025177,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B000J4QWM2,Anton Ilinski,"[5, 7]","I found ""Miami Vice"" rather sophisticated and refined like all Michael Mann's films. I guess many viewers boo it because they expected something explosive like ""Bad Boys 2"" or something alike. Well, that's not the way Mann works. ""Manhunter"" was not as intense and mindblowing as Brett Ratner's ""Red Dragon"" maybe and ""Heat"" was not your average cop movie with all the necessary ingredients like shoot-outs, car-persuits and so on. They were in the feature, but ""Heat"" was not all about that. The same thing here - ""MV"" is based primarily on psychological tension and not on usual genre's attributes. It doesn't matter how many cars will be crashed and how many explosions we will see. It's more about simple undercover agents doing their routine work. It's about what it's like to live a double life, to be among people normally you wouldn't want to be around, to participate in things that can turn you into a much worse person, and it's about an inner core which helps a man not to become one of those he's hunting down.And from this point of view ""MV"" is definately not an entertainment. Don't try to see it as an action-movie. It's rather a thorough insight into a masculine psyche as ""Heat"" was. And Michael Mann is making his research concentrating mainly on tiny details. If you watch closely you'll notice many of them and they'll colour this film for you. Yes, I know, it was mentioned before but that barely visible tear trace on Li Gong's cheek was just ingenious. Speaking of Li Gong, I must say I was truly dazed by her performance and I already see her glorious future in Hollywood.Another thing that can't escape your attention is how beautifully the whole feature is shot. Without any CG Michael Mann manages to wait till the right moment for his shot and that really pays off. Those views of waterfalls, background sheet lightnings, ocean at night and distant rain from the cloud the airplane is approaching just deserve an academy award for cinematography.Yes, the shoot-out in the end of the film is brilliant. Maybe still not as brilliant as ""Heat's"" one but still. Try watch it in a theater because the sound effects will blow your mind - looks and sounds like bullets can literally blow your brains out.The one thing I disliked in the film was the relationship between Farrell's and Foxx's characters. It was not fully elaborated, looks like during the whole movie they were existing apart from each other. They were doing the same work, talked a lot of course, but I couldn't catch that chemistry between them. The only time I really saw their friendship was in the end when Foxx's character was asking Farrell's about his relationships with Li Gong's character. But I had to wait for two hours for this conversation.All other things in the film were great. I think if you remind yourself before the viewing that it's a Michael Mann's feature, you'll get the right mood and like it.P.S. About Ferrari - no they didn't buy it on their police officers' salaries. They are undercover agents who have to be convincing as people who are doing drug trafficing. And those people are usually filthy rich. They are not cops in a Ferrari, they are drug dealers in a Ferrari.",5,ANOTHER AWESOME WORK BY MICHAEL MANN,1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,3188,"['found', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'rather', 'sophisticated', 'refined', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'films', 'guess', 'many', 'viewers', 'boo', 'expected', 'something', 'explosive', 'Bad', 'Boys', '2', 'something', 'alike', 'Well', 'not', 'way', 'Mann', 'Manhunter', 'was', 'not', 'intense', 'mindblowing', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'maybe', 'Heat', 'was', 'not', 'average', 'cop', 'movie', 'necessary', 'ingredients', 'shoot-outs', 'car-persuits', 'so', 'were', 'feature', 'Heat', 'was', 'not', 'same', 'thing', 'here', 'MV', 'based', 'primarily', 'psychological', 'tension', 'not', 'usual', 'genre', 'attributes', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'cars', 'will', 'be', 'crashed', 'how', 'many', 'explosions', 'will', 'see', 'more', 'about', 'simple', 'undercover', 'agents', 'doing', 'routine', 'work', 'what', 'live', 'double', 'life', 'be', 'people', 'normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'around', 'participate', 'things', 'can', 'turn', 'much', 'worse', 'person', 'inner', 'core', 'man', 'not', 'become', 'one', 'hunting', 'down.And', 'point', 'view', 'MV', 'definately', 'not', 'entertainment', 'Do', ""n't"", 'try', 'see', 'action-movie', 'rather', 'thorough', 'insight', 'masculine', 'psyche', 'Heat', 'was', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'making', 'research', 'concentrating', 'mainly', 'tiny', 'details', 'watch', 'closely', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'many', ""'ll"", 'colour', 'film', 'Yes', 'know', 'was', 'mentioned', 'barely', 'visible', 'tear', 'trace', 'Li', 'Gong', 'cheek', 'was', 'just', 'ingenious', 'Speaking', 'Li', 'Gong', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'truly', 'dazed', 'performance', 'already', 'see', 'glorious', 'future', 'Hollywood.Another', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'attention', 'how', 'beautifully', 'whole', 'feature', 'shot', 'CG', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'wait', 'till', 'right', 'moment', 'shot', 'really', 'off', 'views', 'waterfalls', 'sheet', 'lightnings', 'ocean', 'night', 'distant', 'rain', 'cloud', 'airplane', 'approaching', 'just', 'deserve', 'academy', 'award', 'cinematography.Yes', 'shoot-out', 'end', 'film', 'brilliant', 'Maybe', 'still', 'not', 'as', 'brilliant', 'Heat', 'one', 'still', 'Try', 'watch', 'theater', 'sound', 'effects', 'will', 'blow', 'mind', 'looks', 'sounds', 'bullets', 'can', 'literally', 'blow', 'brains', 'out.The', 'one', 'thing', 'disliked', 'film', 'was', 'relationship', 'Farrell', 'Foxx', 'characters', 'was', 'not', 'fully', 'elaborated', 'whole', 'movie', 'were', 'existing', 'apart', 'other', 'were', 'doing', 'same', 'work', 'talked', 'lot', 'course', 'could', ""n't"", 'catch', 'chemistry', 'only', 'time', 'really', 'saw', 'friendship', 'was', 'end', 'when', 'Foxx', 'character', 'was', 'asking', 'Farrell', 'relationships', 'Li', 'Gong', 'character', 'had', 'wait', 'two', 'hours', 'conversation.All', 'other', 'things', 'film', 'were', 'great', 'think', 'remind', 'viewing', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'feature', ""'ll"", 'get', 'right', 'mood', 'it.P.S', 'Ferrari', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'police', 'officers', 'salaries', 'are', 'undercover', 'agents', 'who', 'have', 'be', 'convincing', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'doing', 'drug', 'trafficing', 'people', 'are', 'usually', 'filthy', 'rich', 'are', 'not', 'cops', 'Ferrari', 'are', 'drug', 'dealers', 'Ferrari']",N/A

Weeks prior to this release, before I even knew about the movie, I had just purchased season one on DVD and had been watching a Miami Vice marathon on some cable channel.  So I was pretty geared up for the film, primarily because it was to be directed by Michael Mann, the original show's creator.Saw it the opening weekend and was disappointed.  Other than the names and the setting, it wasn't what I expected.  And that was the problem.  The television show this isn't.  And that is the movie's strength.  It is much more atmospheric, much darker and much more slick.I'm not sure how someone who was unfamiliar with the show would feel about the character development.  From the point of view of someone who knew the show, there is minimal character development in the movie.  Granted, two hours isn't much time.  But you get a lot of attitude, a lot of cool and a lot of action.  Just don't expect too much depth.But Mann's characteristic style, mood and imagery blazes off the screen.

Despite familiar Mann trappings (wonderful camera shots, effective music score and the now standard action set pieces) this is a surprisingly dull and lifeless affair.  Gong Li is miscast, Farrell tries way too hard, and fails, to be effortlessly cool and there is simply no sense of friendship between the leads.  Factor in over-length, a ponderous middle section, limp sex scenes and atrocious HD photography (seriously, if you shoot in this horrific medium why even bother employing a cinematographer - is it THAT much cheaper and easier to use!?) and the end result is a massive disappointment.

1025180,A1QG4TLIYZRL7L,B000J4QWM2,"Arthur Blenheim ""arthurblenheim""","[6, 8]","Miami Vice, I think, is a very good film.  I saw the movie in the theater, but bought the DVD of the ""Unrated"" version because I liked the film, even more than some other people who have criticized it.  Overall, I find Michael Mann to be a very engaging director, his films very competent and compelling, and I like listening to his video commentaries. He's directed a lot of excellent films. Incidentally, and this is an argument defending the films mentioned here, some people thought ""Heat"" was too long. I try to understand people's arguments about these things, and I'm always willing to listen, but somehow I just figured these criticisms as much more inferior than the Miami Vice movie, an extremely intelligent actioner in the mode of Director Mann's Heat with Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro, but with the visual extravagance in photography, in props, in script, and in the streamlined plot.  Miami Vice, especially the preferred Unrated Director's Edition available on home video, is a genuine interpretation of the original and popular television series from the late 1980s.The director, Michael Mann, was propelled into theatrical film making because of his work on that show.  He went on to create the truly-first film in the series of Hannibal Lechter movies: Manhunter.  The more recent Red Dragon movie is actually a remake of Manhunter.  Mann directed Heat with Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, and a hoard of other famous names.  He directed The Insider with Al Pacino, and Russell Crowe in his best performance.  He directed Ali, the Muhammad Ali boxing movie starring Will Smith and Jamie Foxx, a film also enduring lackluster reviews despite its competence.  He directed Collateral with Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise, a widely well-received film, for which Foxx received a supporting-role Oscar nomination, but instead received the Best Actor Oscar for Ray of that same year.  And now, he stars in this Mann film, at least their third director-actor collaboration, and this film has been panned by the public as ""too much talk,"" ""not like the show,"" or ""more violent,"" criticisms all of which have been completely off.Perhaps the masses are too finicky about artistic treatments to semi-mainstream products.  Such is the case with Miami Vice, a very-good-if-not-great actioner worthy of no less than a four-star rating.  What this film needs and deserves is critical support; but, don't depend on some writers to change their views from the mainstream here.  This reminds me of the early reviews on Ridley Scott's film, Blade Runner, which only a few critics supported originally, meaning they completely disliked it, and yet since have canted their opinions to make that film become widely accepted as a five-star classic holding the reputation of the then-minority.  I only wish I knew what the people who spoke negatively about the Miami Vice movie were thinking when they watched it.  Their attentions have been ignorant at best.",5,"Miami Vice, the Movie: the Mainstream Masses Have Missed the Boat, Here",1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,2939,"['Miami', 'Vice', 'think', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Unrated', 'version', 'liked', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'criticized', 'Overall', 'find', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'be', 'very', 'engaging', 'director', 'films', 'very', 'competent', 'compelling', 'like', 'listening', 'video', 'commentaries', 'directed', 'lot', 'excellent', 'films', 'Incidentally', 'argument', 'defending', 'films', 'mentioned', 'here', 'people', 'thought', 'Heat', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'try', 'understand', 'people', 'arguments', 'things', ""'m"", 'always', 'willing', 'listen', 'somehow', 'just', 'figured', 'criticisms', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'inferior', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'movie', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'actioner', 'mode', 'Director', 'Mann', 'Heat', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'visual', 'extravagance', 'photography', 'props', 'script', 'streamlined', 'plot', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'especially', 'preferred', 'Unrated', 'Director', 'Edition', 'available', 'home', 'video', 'genuine', 'interpretation', 'original', 'popular', 'television', 'series', 'late', '1980s.The', 'director', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'was', 'propelled', 'theatrical', 'film', 'making', 'work', 'show', 'went', 'create', 'truly-first', 'film', 'series', 'Hannibal', 'Lechter', 'movies', 'Manhunter', 'more', 'recent', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'movie', 'actually', 'remake', 'Manhunter', 'Mann', 'directed', 'Heat', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'hoard', 'other', 'famous', 'names', 'directed', 'Insider', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'best', 'performance', 'directed', 'Ali', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'boxing', 'movie', 'starring', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'film', 'also', 'enduring', 'lackluster', 'reviews', 'competence', 'directed', 'Collateral', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'widely', 'well-received', 'film', 'Foxx', 'received', 'supporting-role', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'instead', 'received', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'Ray', 'same', 'year', 'now', 'Mann', 'film', 'least', 'third', 'director-actor', 'collaboration', 'film', 'been', 'panned', 'public', 'too', 'much', 'talk', 'not', 'show', 'more', 'violent', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'masses', 'are', 'too', 'finicky', 'artistic', 'treatments', 'semi-mainstream', 'products', 'Such', 'case', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'very-good-if-not-great', 'actioner', 'worthy', 'less', 'four-star', 'rating', 'What', 'film', 'needs', 'deserves', 'critical', 'support', 'do', ""n't"", 'depend', 'writers', 'change', 'views', 'mainstream', 'here', 'early', 'reviews', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'film', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'only', 'few', 'critics', 'supported', 'originally', 'meaning', 'completely', 'disliked', 'yet', 'have', 'canted', 'opinions', 'make', 'film', 'become', 'widely', 'accepted', 'five-star', 'classic', 'holding', 'reputation', 'then-minority', 'only', 'wish', 'knew', 'what', 'people', 'who', 'spoke', 'negatively', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'movie', 'were', 'thinking', 'when', 'watched', 'attentions', 'have', 'been', 'ignorant', 'best']",N/A
1025181,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B000J4QWM2,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[157, 188]","Michael Mann has always been in the forefront of experimenting and trying out new film techniques and styles to tell his stories. His last film, 2003's Collateral, was a veritable masterpiece of directing modern, urban noir. He even made Tom Cruise very believable as a sociopathic character. It is now 2006 and Michael Mann has followed up Collateral with another trip down the darkside of the law and crime. Taking a concept he made into a cultural phenomenon during the mid 80's, Mann reinvents Miami Vice from the pastel colors, hedonistic and over-the-top drug-culture Miami to a more down, dirty and shadowy world where extremes by both the cops and the criminals rule the seedy, forgotten side of Miami.Michael Mann's films have always dealt with the extremes in its characters. Whether its James Caan's thief character Frank in Thief, the dueling detective and thief of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro, up to Foxx and Cruise's taxi driver and assassin. They all have had one thing in common. They're individuals dedicated to their chosen craft. Professional in all respect and so focused to doing their job right that they've crossed the line to obsession. These men have an obsession to doing their jobs to the point that its become like a drug to keep them going. This theme continues in Mann's film reboot of his TV series Miami Vice. The characters remain the same. There's still the two main characters of Vice Detectives Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs. This time around these titular characters were played by Colin Farrell (in a look that echoes Gregg Allman more than Don Johnson) and Jamie Foxx. From the first second all the way through to the final fade to black in the end of the film the audience was thrust immediately into the meat of the action. Mann dispenses with the need for any sort of opening credits. In fact, the title of the film doesn't appear until the end of the film and the same goes for the names of all involved. I thought this was a nice touch. It gave the film a stronger realism throughout.The film's story was a mixture of past classic episodes rolled into one two-hour long film with the episode ""Smuggler's Blues"" being the main influence on the story. The glamour and glitz that were so prevalent in the original series does show up in the film, but it's not used too much that it turned the characters of Crockett, Tubbs and the rest of the cast into caricatures. The glamour seems more of a thin veneer to hide the danger inherent in all the parties involved. These people were all dangerous from the cops to the criminals. There's alot of the so-called ""gray areas"" between what makes a cop and what makes a criminal. Mann's always been great in blurring those lines and in showing that people on either side of the line have much more in common than they realize.Miami Vice's story doesn't leave much for back story exposition for the main leads. Michael Mann takes the minimalist approach and just introduces the characters right from the beginning with nothing to explain who they were outside of the roles they played --- whether they be law-enforcement or drug dealers. The script allows for little personal backstory and instead lets the actors' performance show just what moves, motivates and inspires these characters. Again, Jamie Foxx steals the film from his more glamorous co-star in Colin Farrell. Farrell did a fine job in making Crockett the high-risk taking and intense half of the partnership, but Foxx's no-nonsense, focused intensity as Tubbs was the highlight performance throughout the film. The rest of the cast do a fine job in the their roles. From Gong Li as Isabella the drug-lord's moll who also double's as his organization's brains behind the finances to Luis Tosar as the mastermind drug kingping Arc&aacute;ngel de Jes&uacute;s Montoya. Tosar as Montoya also does a standout performance, but was in the screen for too less a time.This film wouldn't be much of a police crime drama if it was all talk and no action. The action in Miami Vice comes fast and tight. Each scene was played out with a tightness and intensity which prepped the audience to the point that the violence that suddenly arrives was almost a release. Everyone in the theater knew what was coming and when the violence and action does arrive it goes in hard and fast with little or no tricks of rapid editing, slow-motion sequences or fancy camera angles and tricks like most action films. Instead Michael Mann continues his theme of going for realism even in these pivotal moments in the film. The shootouts doesn't have the feel of artificiality. The gunshot inflicted on the people in the film were brutal, violent and quick. The camera doesn't linger on the dead and wounded. These scenes must've taken only a few minutes of the film's running time, but they were minutes that were executed with Swiss-like precision.The look of the film was where Mann's signature could be seen from beginning to end. He started using digital cameras heavily in Collateral. He used it to great effect to give the film a sense of ""in the now"" realism. His decision to use digital cameras for that film also was due to a story mostly set at night. The use of digital allowed him to capture the deepest black to off-set the grays and blues of Los Angeles at night. Mann does the same for Miami Vice, but he does Collateral one better by using digital cameras from beginning to end. Digital lent abit of graininess to some scenes, but it really wasn't as distracting as some reviewers would have you believe. In fact, it made Miami Vice seem like a tale straight out of COPS or one of those reality police shows. Again, Michael Mann stretches the limits of his mind and technology could accomplish when working in concert. Mann's direction and overall work in Miami Vice could only be described as being as focused and obsessive over the smallest detail as the characters in his films. This is a filmmaker who seem to want nothing but perfection in each scene shot.Michael Mann has done the unthinkable and actually made a film adaptation of a TV show look like an art-film posing as a tight police drama. Everyone who have given the film a less than stellar review seem to have done so because Mann didn't use the 80's imagery and sensibilities from the original show. There were no pastel designer clothes and homes. There was no pet alligator and little friendly banter and joking around. Mann goes the other way and keeps the mood deadly serious. This was very apropo since the two leads led mortally dangerous lives as undercover agents who could die at the slightest mistake. The fun and jokes of the original series would've broken the mood and feel of this film. I, for one, am glad Mann went this route and not paid homage to the original series. This some saw as a major flaw, but I saw it as the main advantage in keeping Miami Vice from becoming a self-referential film bordering on camp.Miami Vice was not your typical action-drama for the 2006 summer blockbuster season. Like Collateral in 2004, Michael Mann forgo large effects and drawn out action to sell his film, but made a finished product thats smart, stylish, and innovative crime drama. This was a film that people would either love despite some of the flaws, or one people would hate due to not being like the original TV series. Those who decide to skip watching Miami Vice because of the latter would miss a great film from one of this generation's best directors. Those who do give this Miami Vice a chance would be rewarded with one of the best films of 2006.",5,"Michael Mann gives us the real, down and dirty underbelly of Miami Vice",1154217600,"07 30,

That was the case with me and this Miami Vice movie.  Boring as a film can possibly be, in my opinion.  It's like one person could write a storyline similar to the one in this film in about 45 minutes.  But it's not really my thing, so please understand.  I'm sure more thought and energy went into creating it.However, I really think there was very little in the way of action, and WAY too much time was spent during the middle parts of the film involving a quiet, slow-building relationship between Colin Farrell and the Chinese woman.  So boring.  It seemed like it was never going to end.  I really hate these kind of movies.  A movie that takes two hours to tell a story which ends up going NOWHERE.  The appeal of a movie like this boggles my  mind.",1,about as unspectacular as a bad movie can be,1170892800,"02 8, 2007",2007,1286,"['Please', 'keep', 'mind', 'crime', 'detective', 'shows', 'are', 'bottom', 'list', 'when', 'things', 'enjoy', 'television', 'Sometimes', 'can', 'build', '*little*', 'suspense', 'most', 'time', 'movie', 'plot', 'up', 'dragging', 'dragging', 'dragging', 'more.As', 'kind', 'movies', 'roll', 'along', 'typically', 'begin', 'forget', 'purpose', 'main', 'things', 'see', 'happening', 'screen', 'stop', 'caring', 'storyline', 'characters', 'just', 'end', 'up', 'wishing', 'movie', 'would', 'hurry', 'up', 'finish', 'was', 'case', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'movie', 'Boring', 'film', 'can', 'possibly', 'be', 'opinion', 'one', 'person', 'could', 'write', 'storyline', 'similar', 'one', 'film', '45', 'minutes', 'not', 'really', 'thing', 'so', 'please', 'understand', ""'m"", 'sure', 'more', 'thought', 'energy', 'went', 'creating', 'it.However', 'really', 'think', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'action', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'middle', 'parts', 'film', 'involving', 'quiet', 'slow-building', 'relationship', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'So', 'boring', 'seemed', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'end', 'really', 'hate', 'kind', 'movies', 'movie', 'two', 'hours', 'tell', 'story', 'up', 'going', 'NOWHERE', 'appeal', 'movie', 'boggles', 'mind']",N/A
1025184,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000J4QWM2,Boss Fan,"[43, 50]","Okay, okay, so we all know now Michael Mann's dark, brooding reimagining of his own cultural classic is not your father's ""Miami Vice"" of the mid-80s (or, not your ten-year-old self's ""Vice"" at any rate).  Gone are the pastels, Elvis the alligator and almost all back-story of our cops  on a personal level (or any level really).  As the movie begins the viewer is immediately plunged into the middle of Sonny Crocket and Ricardo Tubbs on the job.  Crocket gets a phone call and within minutes the plot of the film is set in motion and we are off and running.  No introductions, no set-ups; the viewer is just thrown into a ride-along as these two undercover cops take on their next case.This ""Miami Vice"" is clearly meant to be something of an examination of undercover work, as opposed to any kind of conventional storytelling in your standard action film.  But then Michael Mann is no standard action filmmaker.  How he has evolved from his work on ""Vice"" in its TV heyday to now is like night and day, but the core of what made him a visionary talent even back than has not changed.  While this ""Miami Vice"" may tone down the colorful, hedonistic aspects that the show is remembered for, Mann still remembers to portray, not only Miami, but Cuba, Portugal and host of other global locations, in all their vibrant cultural allure.  Crocket and Tubs still take advantage of being undercover by trolling around in designer clothes, expensive cars, and fast boats.But this is all painted on a much darker palate this time.  I'm not sure we ever glimpse Miami during the day and there are no scenes of women roaming the beach in skimpy bikinis.  Crocket and Tubbs speak to each other in the same monosyllabic, one word sentences they speak to the bad guys in; rarely do they joke or have any long, buddy-copish conversations about life, love, their pasts, the job, or even where the other is going when they decide to run off for two days.  They always look stoic, serious and focused constantly on the job.  They don't even stop to reflect that 'holy s**t, I'm driving a Ferrari at 160 miles per hour!'Yes, this film is all about the 'vice.'  Mann wants to throw us into the undercover world and game.  As a procedural examination of that world ""Miami Vice"" is rather fascinating.  I could gripe that really exciting undercover cop movies would include more personal drama for our heroes, ala there are more close calls where they are inches from having their cover blown, or a scene where they are discovered and how are they gonna get out of it.  But ""Miami Vice"" isn't trying to be a typical undercover cop movie.  It may lose some suspense and opportunities for more action sequences because of this approach, but the idea here, I guess, is this is just one case in a string of them that these guys tackle every day.  We are just watching them do their thing on this particular job.There is a little bit of initiative to shake things up near the end when, due to the baddy's suspicions, a deal goes wrong and one of Crocket and Tubbs' colleagues is placed in peril.  This scene includes a terrific ""Dirty Harry"" moment and is done so well you almost wish there were more of them.  The flip side to that coin though is that then these moments would risk becoming somewhat rote and overtake the plot: too much of a good thing.  As they are, they make for great surprises that stand-out in the midst of a movie that is ultimately more plot-driven and story-focused than action packed.  So strict action-junkies beware:  There's always, say, ""Bad Boys"" and its sequel if you want pretty Miami locals, lots buddy cop jokularity, and blow'em-up action and chase scenes.  ""Miami Vice"" is not that movie - and it is clearly trying very hard to be anything but that movie.But as usual with Mann, when the action kicks in, these scenes are better than almost any of their kind.  No matter what you thought of Mann's ""Heat,"" you have to admit that it includes one of the best shoot-outs ever captured on film.  ""Miami Vice"" has a climatic shoot-out that, like ""Heat itself in my opinion, while not as good, has many of the same great qualities. Where your typical director would stage such a sequence with lots of music or editing tricks to lead the audience, Mann keeps everything quiet, except for the deafening pops of gun shots.  No editing tricks, slow-motion, etc, but Mann's expert camera work puts us right there.  At one moment a camera is placed behind one of the baddies during the shoot out.  He gets blown away by one of the cops and the camera runs left over to one of the other bad guys and positions itself behind him.  Get it?  The camera is us.  There is also a chaos to the camera movements in these moments, further giving us the you-are-there feeling, trying to show what it must be like to be in the middle of such a war zone.Mann also knows how to make a film look great.  He shoots with digital cameras so everything almost looks superimposed over everything else.  This is especially awe-inspiring when characters are on rooftops, shot against the night sky and the blinking city lights behind them.  There are also sweeping cinematic shots of the sky, ocean, water falls, freeways and cityscapes.  And when we delve into the drug dealing underworld or Miami nightclubs, Mann gives a the film a grainy, security camera voyeur look to the proceedings.Yes, this is one great looking film.  And an expertly made one.  One of the best by both standards.  But it is also well written and smartly executed.  However, despite all of this, there a few things that, while not flaws exactly, at least leave a something to be desired.  I get that the lack of character development was probably intentional.  I guess we are just supposed to assume that everything we know about Crockett and Tubbs of yore remains true and we are simply catching up with them again and following them on one of their darker cases. Either that or who they are is rather perfunctory and moot given the proceedings and we are just supposed to be watching two undercover cops do their thing.  You wonder if Mann would have even bothered giving them names if he didn't have to.  But then why call it ""Miami Vice"" at all?  I suppose hardcore fans would be forgiven for being a little let down that a movie called ""Miami Vice"" has very little to do with Miami itself or the characters they were looking forward to rediscovering.  I'm sure they would all be fine with updating the proceedings and getting rid of some of the campier fare, but still would rather not feel like this movie could exist just as it is and never had been called ""Miami Vice.""That is a minor quibble however, for myself anyway, because I was never the biggest ""Miami Vice"" fan - contrary to pictures my mom might show of me running around in a white sport coat with a water gun at seven years old.  I guess I liked it then, but watching it now the show feels too much of its time for me to really get into.  Not the show's fault by any means, and that is not to say it is not without its assets (again, credit mainly goes to Mann), but it just doesn't hold my interest.  Cop shows have come a long way.  So perhaps Mann's intent here is to bring ""Miami Vice"" that distance; to catch up to where cop dramas have traveled to in the 20 years since all things ""Miami Vice.""I sympathize with those who think this isn't really much of a remake or update; or were looking forward to something with the high-octane style of the TV show -  Was I the only one half expecting the movie to begining with the Universal logo (you know, that classic shot of the slowly spinning earth with ""Universal"" splashed over it) and then a shot zooming in on the U.S., then Florida, then Miami, as slowly the actual gulf coast is super imposed over the logo and then we pan and zoom further still into the heart of the city and then finally into a night club where Crockett and Tubbs are set up for action, or perhaps a freeway, or boat chase, already in progress?  I still say its a cool idea (if I've explained it right).  There's always the sequel.  But again, that is not the ""Miami Vice"" this movie wants to be. - but speaking to those who are hoping for something completely different, or may be staying away because they didn't like the show, this film will satisfy you more than you would expect.Again, action junkies may be disappointed.  It is best you view this as an undercover procedural, not a rock 'em, sock 'em action flick.  But even as much as I recomend this film, I'd be willing to conceed that it could have used a little more adrenaline at times, or at least more of a sense of danger for our cops.  For instance, Mann was able to sustain tension for 3 hours with ""Heat"" and gave us only one action scene per hour.  But ""Heat"" maintained a feeling of constant tension between the cops and crooks, the crooks and crooks, the cop and his family, and the characters internal struggles.  If ""Miami Vice"" fails to accomplish the same sense of empathy for its characters and their situations, it is because it is written as one half of ""Heat.""  ""Heat"" is a character driven crime saga:  you see the inner workings of their jobs as well as their inner workings.  ""Vice"" is simply a crime saga.  That may lose ""Vice"" some of the tension that comes with knowing and truly caring for the characters, but that it musters even half the greatness of ""Heat"" is still a huge feat.And in a summer where every 'big' movie so far has failed to live up to even a fraction of its hype (to these eyes anyway), ""Miami Vice"" is, so far, far and away at the top of its summer blockbuster class.",4,More

1025185,AZO5E3NG0WCHG,B000J4QWM2,"B. Parker ""bcsparker""","[9, 9]","OK, I've read a lot of the lower-star reviews of this, and I'm completely floored by some of these comments. So please allow me to frame my review in the form of answering other people's opinions.1. ""It's called Miami Vice, but hardly anything happens in Miami."" - It's called an international drug trade, people. That's why things take place in Haiti, Uruguay, Havana, Columbia, etc. These are the places that the drugs come from. In real life, the cops have to seek out these things at the source. Hell, if they were to just wait for this stuff to show up on American soil, they've lost half the battle.2. ""The action is boring and there's not enough of it."" - Okay, it's not that it's boring, it's just shot and performed realistically. You people are so used to being spoon-fed flashy Hollywood action scenes, with jump-cut editing and unbelievably loud sound effects, that being confronted with an actual tactical gunfight, you don't know what to do. And as for there not being enough action, do you think undercover work is all shootouts?3. ""There's no chemistry between Farrell and Fox."" - While they don't seem buddy-buddy, I think they have a realistic relationship. In their line of work, especially on the job, they have to be all business. Did you guys expect them to be cracking jokes and stealing each other's girlfriends? Along those lines, the number of people reviewing this that look back fondly on the ""Bad Boys"" movies physically disgusts me.4. ""It doesn't look like the show."" - What the heck do you expect, pastels, pretty sunsets, and sailboats? Does it make you mad that Crockett's pet alligator doesn't make an appearance? The way I look at it, the original Miami Vice was Michael Mann's creation, so he can do whatever he wants with the film. The fact that he chose to make a movie that really digs into what guys like this do is refreshing, rather than putting on some glitzy ""T&A; and palm trees"" spectacle.5. ""Gong Li looks horrible and her accent is bad."" - First off, she is in her 40's. You don't have to look airbrushed at that age. Would you kick her out of bed? And as far as her accent, she speaks only Mandarin, so she had to learn all her lines phonetically, so give her a break!6. People seem to have a problem with some of the terms the guys use. Listen, as hokey as it sounds, ""go-fast boats"" is actually a phrase people use to describe those watercraft. And as hokey as it may seem to hear things like ""op sec"" or ""transpo"", those are real terms used in this kind of work!While people say they wish it looked like the show, I think what the real problem is that it doesn't look like that apex of bad television - ""CSI: Miami"". Here, there's no burnt-sienna skies, no cutaways to inexplicable helicopter shots of the Miami scenery or jump cuts to bikinis on the beach, no gaudily-lit police station shots. It actually looks like Miami, for chrissakes! I was sold on the look of this movie when Crockett walks out on to the balcony near the beginning and you see the amazing deep focus of the skyline and the night sky. The fact that this was shot on digital video enabled them to capture amazing things like the clouds. I mean, look at the boat race at the beginning - it's beautiful.Now I won't say this is a problem-free film. I don't understand Tubb's overwrought concern for the prostitute in the club scene. And to me, John Ortiz's accent seems way to affected - it sounds like a white guy playing at being a Latino, even though John is hispanic. And yes, the fact that Colin and Gong Li's relationship is staring everyone in the face, and doesn't become an issue until later, is kinda dumb. And admittedly, a lot of inertia is lost in the middle when their relationship is being explored. But hey, every movie has problems.Overall, this is a much subtler film than people expected.

Miami Vice fits well into his catalogue. The resemblence to his 1980's television show is in name only. The show gave us pastel colors and attitude and made stars of Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas. The film is gritty and dirty looking and takes us inside the lives of deep undrcover operatives.The plot has been done many times before: undercover cops must take down drug lord but remain true to themselves. Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell manage to do quite well with the material they are given. Some of the dialog is mumbled and the story gets too complicated at times for its own good but this is a surprisingly well made and well thought out film. An excellent commentary track my Mann gets into the nuts and bolts of the filmaking process and the casting choices. Into the usual mix is thrown a romance with one of the drug lord's women expertly played by Gong Li. Her acting is one of the highs of the film.Bottom line is if you are looking for a standard reprise of the television show this is not the film for you.

1025190,A2S02XWWNNHUIX,B000J4QWM2,C. E. Miles,"[3, 6]","In the 1980's I was a huge fan of the `Miami Vice' television series. In spite of the fact that I have seen every episode ever produced, at least twice, I have managed to grow up, keep a job and find a wife. When I heard that they were finally going to make a big screen version, you may have guessed that I was quite excited. Imagine my disappointment when what was actually released bared absolutely no resemblance to the television series that spawned an entire genre. The motion picture release of `Miami Vice' simply borrows the names of the original characters and the music video style and ""re-imagines"" them in modern day Miami.Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Rico Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) are the best undercover vice cops on the force, and due to an undetermined leak inside the Justice Department, they are called in to assist the FBI in brining down a group of domestic terrorists. As the detectives and their team begin to infiltrate the seamy underbelly of the organization they soon realize that they have an opportunity to fry a much bigger fish in the person of an international drug and arms broker. Unfortunately, with bigger rewards there must also be greater risks, and so our hero's find themselves on the ragged edge of the law without a net, and very little margin for error.In my opinion, the plot of the film borrows heavily (very heavily) from one of the television episodes titled ""Smugglers Blues"" which co-starred Glen Frey (The Eagles) who had a hit song at the time with the same title. Had this movie simply carried a different title, I think it would have done far better than it has, both critically and in overall viewer ship. With the title, came an overabundance of expectations which writer/director Michael Mann (Manhunter, Heat, The Insider, Collateral)had no intention of living up to. In spite of the visually stunning look of the film, the chemistry between the two leads is nonexistent (rumor has it that the shoot was not a pleasant place to be with all of the egos vying for screen time), and the story itself seems to bog down too often, leading up to the explosive climax one has come to expect from a Mann directed film. Although the run time for the unrated directors cut is listed at 140 minutes, it feels quite a bit longer. I think it's because, for several stretches of the movie, it just feels like nothing actually happens. I wanted to like it, I tried to like, but I just didn't like it.

Where do I start?Michael Mann has been making some great crime movies over his years: Thief, Manhunter, Heat (one of my favorites) and Collateral. With Miami Vice he went with the same realistic theme we saw in those movies and with it, we lost the flash and color of Miami. We lost the charm and spectacle that made the television series, in which this movie is based upon, such a quality show, STILL.I didn't necessarily go into Miami Vice (the movie) looking for Miami Vice (the series), but you sort of half expect it to be a little bit similar, otherwise, why call them Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Tubbs (Jamie Foxx)? After watching Miami Vice (the movie) I wish they WOULD have just made it an original story and not a based it on a television show, because if they had... I would have given it 2 stars.Heck, after seeing this, I would have given 4 stars to see Owen Wilson & Eddie Murphy as Crockett & Tubbs.That being said, lets say that it is an original storyline and not based on a television series. MIAMI VICE is quite simply... boring and drab and a god awful waste of time. The two actors, most specifically Colin Farrell, are drawn down and deliver their lines like they are wasted out of their minds themselves. Maybe that explains why Farrell checked into rehab immediately after shooting?The first thing I look for in a film is a character that you can get into and actually WANT to spend the next 2 hours with... in this case, 2 hours and 20 minutes. This movie is completely void of this and I realized it within 20 minutes. I didn't register with the characters or the dilemmas. Not once in the entire film did Colin Farrell say a single line with any flair.This was a really bad miscalculation on the filmmakers behalves.

1025195,A256F7E787F5SG,B000J4QWM2,Christopher Nieman,"[32, 39]","Quick, what year is it? -- because it sounds like some of you who are disappointed in the new MIAMI VICE movie haven't gotten rid of your parachute pants yet.Come on, admit it -- you guys just couldn't wait to see a certain Sonny Crockett wearing the iconic white linen suit, the pastel henley shirt, and the sockless espadrilles again, right? -- and now you can't stand seeing an Irishman with a handlebar moustache doing the same role in dark colors. In the backs of your minds, you never gave it a chance.You're probably the same kinds of killjoys who'll whine if the next James Bond film doesn't haul out each and every expected cliche from that franchise. God forbid if Bond doesn't purr his name at a baccarat table! Cry sacrilege!It's time to wake up and smell the now.Michael Mann, creator and mastermind of the highly influential Miami Vice TV series, has retooled his invention into an even sleeker, faster, more muscular, and thoroughly modern machine of a feature-length film. Those of us who remember watching the original series hoped for years to see a feature-length film of our favorite show -- and we knew it had to do things and take us places the show never could. And damn if the film doesn't do just that. It has all the style, attitude, sex, and violence of the series and then some, with the machismo turned up on afterburner. We jetset from Miami to Paraguay to Cuba to Colombia and back with all the ease of the rich and infamous. Miami Vice has never looked badder or slicker or tougher than it does on the big screen. The series almost looks like it's on a low flame by comparison.The film begins without any preamble, stomps on the gas, and hardly lifts off until it's all over. There's little time for a breath, and even the contemplative scenes burn with a restless intensity worthy of the series' best moments. I expected the cinematography to be very carefully crafted, emphasizing beautiful, colorful shots -- but thankfully, it doesn't look overly calculated. There's a lot of handheld camerawork, mixing digital and film, and many shots almost look hastily, brazenly filmed, as though in a cinema verite style. An obligatory panning shot of our protagonists from a car's hood -- something else the series made iconic -- somehow looks astonishingly fresh and alive on the big screen.One could definitely make quibbles about some of the decisions made for the film. After a while, some of the cheesier ideas of the series began to creep in. The meet with the cartel's operations man looks like a hundred similar scenes from the series -- although it has its potentially explosive moments. I would have liked to hear a little gallows humor, at least, but I could understand why Mann probably wanted to avoid being glib, like the series could be at times. I think Crockett wins over Gong Li's character, Isabella, far too quickly and not quite convincingly, but then that's not atypical of Miami Vice storylines. Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx both look comfortable in their roles, although I'm not sure they show enough chemistry together. I will agree that Foxx is pretty under-utilized, and the characterizations are a little too shallow for us to really care about them. For Gong Li, this might be her best English-language role to date -- helped by a lot of looping in post-production -- and she's able to show off her expressive talents, as always. She even rolls her R's like any good Spanish-speaker.The film has a number of thrilling, boldly edited action scenes and surprise moments -- usually punctuated by blood-spattering violence -- including a showstopper of a scene that could have been pulled straight out of a Dirty Harry movie. A climactic firefight in a deserted shipyard -- although hardly original -- tops any staged for the series, and it's reminiscent of the gigantic bank shootout in another hard-bitten Mann film, HEAT.

This movie just missed the boat. I didn't find myself being drawn into a story at all. I didn't FEEL like this was an action/adventure movie - just 2 actors getting a paycheck and showing some skin so the fans don't feel thoroughly jipped.I don't see how they couldn't feel ripped off! Hey, I like Jamie and Colin. But...C'mon guys...you gotta pick stuff that is worthy of the work you've already done.If I was in a movie theater, I would have walked out LONG before this diatribe finished. I couldn't have tortured myself with trying to watch it there. However I had it BEAMED into my hotel room at a PREMIUM - so, I already had wasted the money...so I kept looking for one sliver of a redeeming quality to this movie. I couldn't find one.Why make Cockett's character LOOK like he did? I didn't get that.Why the gratutious sex scenes (yes, multiple)? Neither character NEEDED the sex scenes where they were placed - and Rico's was what - extended just to fill up the time, to try to detract from the LACK of a well written script?STEALTH was much better than this (and it didn't gross well).I was thoroughly BORED with this movie.

1025198,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000J4QWM2,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[0, 0]","`Miami Vice' is one of those movies that tries to do too much, so much in fact that it begins to lose me about half hay through.  Superbly shot and, surprisingly, well acted, `Miami Vice' could have been a lot better.  It's not horrible, but it falters quite a bit and falls short of excellence.  I almost feel the same was I felt when walking out of `Bad Boys II', that the length of the movie overshadowed what it could have been.  I found myself getting ancy for the credits about an hour and a half in and I still had almost another hour to go.This film really only resembles the TV show in name and location, but the fact that I never watched the TV show kind of voided out that detail.  I actually found the serious tone and gritty direction comforting, because like the `Amazon.com' reviewer stated, this is the type of film that Mann does best.  Mann doesn't deliver solid here though.  I found my attention wavering as the film progressed.  If they had just trimmed a good twenty or thirty minutes from this film it would have served its purpose a little better.  Foxx is a bit annoying here, and while Colin keeps his serious face on throughout the film he ends up becoming a little to stiff.The plot is your generic undercover cop story, Crockett (Farrell) and Tubbs (Foxx) trying to outsmart drug kingpin Montoya (Luis Tosar).  Along the way Crockett falls for the dangerous girl Isabella (Gong Li) while Tubbs' girlfriend, fellow Detective Trudy (Naomie Harris), is kidnapped and used as leverage by the bad guys.  All of this has happened before; I think I even saw most of this in `Bad Boys II' except Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are mush more entertaining.This is not the type of movie that's supposed to inspire or cause you to think, it's merely supposed to entertain, and while it does do that at times it fails to overall impress me or draw me to watch it again, at least not anytime soon.  I was set to be impressed so I think that may be why I'm a little overly disappointed.  The action sequences were spectacular, real and gritty and just what you'd want to see in a film of this nature, but even those, as great as they are, couldn't save this movie from generic disappointment.  Trim it down a little bit and I'll give it another shot.",3,"'Miami' looks great, but it just doesn't fully captivate...",1165536000,"12 8, 2006",2006,2264,"['Miami', 'Vice', 'one', 'movies', 'tries', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'much', 'fact', 'lose', 'half', 'hay', 'Superbly', 'shot', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'acted', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'not', 'horrible', 'quite', 'bit', 'short', 'excellence', 'almost', 'feel', 'same', 'was', 'felt', 'when', 'walking', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'II', 'length', 'movie', 'overshadowed', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'found', 'getting', 'ancy', 'credits', 'hour', 'half', 'still', 'had', 'almost', 'hour', 'go.This', 'film', 'really', 'only', 'TV', 'show', 'name', 'location', 'fact', 'never', 'watched', 'TV', 'show', 'kind', 'voided', 'out', 'detail', 'actually', 'found', 'serious', 'tone', 'gritty', 'direction', 'comforting', 'Amazon.com', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'type', 'film', 'Mann', 'best', 'Mann', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'solid', 'here', 'found', 'attention', 'wavering', 'film', 'progressed', 'had', 'just', 'trimmed', 'good', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'served', 'purpose', 'little', 'better', 'Foxx', 'bit', 'annoying', 'here', 'Colin', 'serious', 'face', 'film', 'up', 'becoming', 'little', 'stiff.The', 'plot', 'generic', 'undercover', 'cop', 'story', 'Crockett', 'Farrell', 'Tubbs', 'Foxx', 'trying', 'outsmart', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'Montoya', 'Luis', 'Tosar', 'way', 'Crockett', 'dangerous', 'girl', 'Isabella', 'Gong', 'Li', 'Tubbs', 'girlfriend', 'fellow', 'Detective', 'Trudy', 'Naomie', 'Harris', 'kidnapped', 'used', 'leverage', 'bad', 'guys', 'happened', 'think', 'even', 'saw', 'most', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'II', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'Will', 'Smith', 'are', 'mush', 'more', 'entertaining.This', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'supposed', 'inspire', 'cause', 'think', 'merely', 'supposed', 'entertain', 'do', 'times', 'overall', 'impress', 'draw', 'watch', 'again', 'least', 'not', 'anytime', 'soon', 'was', 'set', 'be', 'impressed', 'so', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'why', ""'m"", 'little', 'overly', 'disappointed', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'spectacular', 'real', 'gritty', 'just', 'what', ""'d"", 'want', 'see', 'film', 'nature', 'even', 'as', 'great', 'are', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'movie', 'generic', 'disappointment', 'Trim', 'down', 'little', 'bit', ""'ll"", 'give', 'shot']",N/A

1025201,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B000J4QWM2,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[3, 3]","It's no secret that Michael Mann's film adaptation of his time capsule-cool TV show ""Miami Vice"" was a troubled production (hurricanes, cutting deals with drug lords and gangsters will do that to a movie). It's also been no secret that the advance screenings generated all the buzz of a chainsaw underwater. But now, opening for the viewingpublic, how does Miami Vice (Universal Pictures) in the 21st century REELY fare?Opening to a Jiggaman remix inside the energy and vitality of a South Beach club, Miami Vice introduces us to Miami-Dade County undercover cops Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo ""Rico"" Tubbs (Jaime Foxx) on the job. They're pulled off a prostitution ring sting and into an FBI investigation when one of their snitches informs them that the feds have been compromised. Due to their skill level and outsider status, Crockett and Tubbs go deep cover as expert drug traffickers, in order to set up Colombian drug lord Montoya (Luis Tosar), a dealer so successful and vertically integrated, he could have a ticker number on the New York Stock Exchange. As Crockett falls for Montoya's beautiful and invaluable Chinese-Cuban mistress Isabella (Gong Li), both he and Tubbs risk what semblance of real life they have for this boundary-blurring job.A question comes to mind while watching two ""go-fast"" boats slice through ocean waves against a scary cool Miami backdrop in the dead of night: ""Just how did a sixtysomething Man(n), who cut his teeth on TV in the '80s, become the arbiter of cool?"" From the Ozwald Boateng suits to the $100,000 sports cars and beyond, Miami Vice is an adrenaline boost of pure style. Fast cars, slow love, hot women, cool attitudes...Mann and production designer Victor Kempster create a visual eye candy bar for the stylish.In Michael Mann's agreeably and realistically multi-ethnic, multi-national world, I'd dare say Miami's never looked sexier, even with all the color drained out. Matching the serious tone of the lingo-laced Mann script, Vice puts to good use the night-black digital cinematography system he perfected while filming Collateral. The dark tone is justified, merely from the script's shady entanglement of white supremacists, Dominicans, Colombians, Cubans, even a Chinese-Cuban - all criminals, all of whom don't trust each other in a world where anyone can be bought for the right price (just depends on what kinda currency you're using). They speak with such casual knowledge of this ice cold world, they've inented their own language of frostbite, so much so you can almost catch freezer burn just watching. On top of all that, there is an INTENSE stand-off scene that's so frigid and fraught with emotional stakes, you kind of marvel slack-jawed at its violently elegant beauty-that rare violent film that is not gratuitous.If there is any arena that suffers just a bit from over-chill, it might be the acting. The casting is great; what two better ambassadors of gritty, visceral excitement than the hard-livin' Colin Farrell and the hard-partying Jamie Foxx? With such a grave, dire tone all the time, Vice could use just a dollop of humor on occasion just for variety's sake; you can't know real drama without a touch of comedy-not to ingratiate itself to the diehard fans of the oft-times cheesy '80s TV hit, but just to give the viewer a dramatic intermission. As a result, you have Foxx squinting a lot at greasy, handlebar mustachioed Farrell, professing his utmost trust and faith in him without any real scenes in Act One or early Two to show us an example of this. Naomie Harris is fairly convincing with her Noo Yawk accented cop Trudy while Gong Li excels as the dramatic and emotional monkey wrench in Crockett's best laid plans. Does her English suck? Absolutely. But when you look that good, who gives a damn? Li is able to hold men's attention and sway their allegiances with a single, blankly desirous look; she's nothing short of mesmerizing.Sexy, complicated, stylish, and Sub-Zero frosty, Miami Vice is an excellent police story procedural, like the country cousin to HBO's The Wire. But it's so much more. When the stakes get raised so immeasurably late in the second act that this goes from high-sheen Arctic lip gloss to something real and arrestingly dramatic, operatic almost, that's when it's time to take a trip down to South Beach-refrigerator-fresh Vice style.",4,Surprisingly good,1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,4367,"['secret', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'film', 'adaptation', 'time', 'capsule-cool', 'TV', 'show', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'was', 'troubled', 'production', 'hurricanes', 'cutting', 'deals', 'drug', 'lords', 'gangsters', 'will', 'do', 'movie', 'also', 'been', 'secret', 'advance', 'screenings', 'generated', 'buzz', 'chainsaw', 'underwater', 'now', 'opening', 'viewingpublic', 'how', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'Universal', 'Pictures', '21st', 'century', 'REELY', 'fare', 'Opening', 'Jiggaman', 'remix', 'energy', 'vitality', 'South', 'Beach', 'club', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'Miami-Dade', 'County', 'undercover', 'cops', 'Sonny', 'Crockett', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Ricardo', 'Rico', 'Tubbs', 'Jaime', 'Foxx', 'job', ""'re"", 'pulled', 'off', 'prostitution', 'ring', 'sting', 'FBI', 'investigation', 'when', 'one', 'snitches', 'informs', 'feds', 'have', 'been', 'compromised', 'Due', 'skill', 'level', 'outsider', 'status', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'go', 'deep', 'cover', 'expert', 'drug', 'traffickers', 'order', 'set', 'up', 'Colombian', 'drug', 'lord', 'Montoya', 'Luis', 'Tosar', 'dealer', 'so', 'successful', 'vertically', 'integrated', 'could', 'have', 'ticker', 'number', 'New', 'York', 'Stock', 'Exchange', 'Crockett', 'Montoya', 'beautiful', 'invaluable', 'Chinese-Cuban', 'mistress', 'Isabella', 'Gong', 'Li', 'Tubbs', 'risk', 'what', 'semblance', 'real', 'life', 'have', 'boundary-blurring', 'job.A', 'question', 'mind', 'watching', 'two', 'go-fast', 'boats', 'slice', 'ocean', 'waves', 'scary', 'cool', 'Miami', 'backdrop', 'dead', 'night', 'Just', 'how', 'did', 'sixtysomething', 'Man', 'n', 'who', 'cut', 'teeth', 'TV', ""'80s"", 'become', 'arbiter', 'cool', 'Ozwald', 'Boateng', 'suits', '100,000', 'sports', 'cars', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'adrenaline', 'boost', 'pure', 'style', 'Fast', 'cars', 'slow', 'love', 'hot', 'women', 'cool', 'attitudes', 'Mann', 'production', 'designer', 'Victor', 'Kempster', 'create', 'visual', 'eye', 'candy', 'bar', 'stylish.In', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'agreeably', 'realistically', 'multi-ethnic', 'multi-national', 'world', ""'d"", 'dare', 'say', 'Miami', 'never', 'looked', 'sexier', 'even', 'color', 'drained', 'out', 'Matching', 'serious', 'tone', 'lingo-laced', 'Mann', 'script', 'Vice', 'good', 'use', 'night-black', 'digital', 'cinematography', 'system', 'perfected', 'filming', 'Collateral', 'dark', 'tone', 'justified', 'merely', 'script', 'shady', 'entanglement', 'white', 'supremacists', 'Dominicans', 'Colombians', 'Cubans', 'even', 'Chinese-Cuban', 'criminals', 'whom', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'other', 'world', 'where', 'anyone', 'can', 'be', 'bought', 'right', 'price', 'just', 'what', 'kinda', 'currency', ""'re"", 'using', 'speak', 'such', 'casual', 'knowledge', 'ice', 'cold', 'world', ""'ve"", 'inented', 'own', 'language', 'frostbite', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'almost', 'catch', 'freezer', 'burn', 'just', 'watching', 'top', 'INTENSE', 'stand-off', 'scene', 'so', 'frigid', 'fraught', 'emotional', 'stakes', 'kind', 'marvel', 'slack-jawed', 'violently', 'elegant', 'beauty-that', 'rare', 'violent', 'film', 'not', 'gratuitous.If', 'arena', 'just', 'bit', 'over-chill', 'might', 'be', 'acting', 'casting', 'great', 'what', 'two', 'better', 'ambassadors', 'gritty', 'visceral', 'excitement', 'hard-livin', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'hard-partying', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'grave', 'dire', 'tone', 'time', 'Vice', 'could', 'use', 'just', 'dollop', 'humor', 'occasion', 'just', 'variety', 'sake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'know', 'real', 'drama', 'touch', 'comedy-not', 'ingratiate', 'diehard', 'fans', 'oft-times', 'cheesy', ""'80s"", 'TV', 'hit', 'just', 'give', 'viewer', 'dramatic', 'intermission', 'result', 'have', 'Foxx', 'squinting', 'lot', 'greasy', 'handlebar', 'mustachioed', 'Farrell', 'professing', 'utmost', 'trust', 'faith', 'real', 'scenes', 'Act', 'One', 'early', 'Two', 'show', 'example', 'Naomie', 'Harris', 'fairly', 'convincing', 'Noo', 'Yawk', 'accented', 'cop', 'Trudy', 'Gong', 'Li', 'excels', 'dramatic', 'emotional', 'monkey', 'wrench', 'Crockett', 'best', 'laid', 'plans', 'English', 'suck', 'Absolutely', 'when', 'look', 'good', 'who', 'damn', 'Li', 'able', 'hold', 'men', 'attention', 'sway', 'allegiances', 'single', 'blankly', 'desirous', 'look', 'nothing', 'short', 'mesmerizing.Sexy', 'complicated', 'stylish', 'Sub-Zero', 'frosty', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'excellent', 'police', 'story', 'procedural', 'country', 'cousin', 'HBO', 'Wire', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'When', 'stakes', 'get', 'raised', 'so', 'immeasurably', 'late', 'second', 'act', 'high-sheen', 'Arctic', 'lip', 'gloss', 'something', 'real', 'arrestingly', 'dramatic', 'operatic', 'almost', 'when', 'time', 'take', 'trip', 'down', 'South', 'Beach-refrigerator-fresh', 'Vice', 'style']",N/A
1025202,AGCVPCMDY4Q2W,B000J4QWM2,David Harvey,"[0, 0]","Michael Mann's return to the classic creation of the late 80's, &#34;Miami Vice&#34;, brings back characters from the original (Sonny Crockett, Ricardo Tubbs, Gina Calabrese, Trudy Joplin, Larry Zito, Stan Switek, and Lieutenant Castillo.  However, that's pretty much where the similarities end from the original.  Gone is the ground breaking music helmed by Jan Hammer - which greatly set the tone of the stories from the classic series.  That said, common elements remain as go-fast boats (cigarette boats), a Ferrari, and planes remain keynote means of travel by the main characters, and the plot is driven by the character's covers having strong impact on the original reason for the characters going undercover to begin with.  So, while different, there are enough common themes that make this &#34;Miami Vice&#34; feel close enough to the original (they even through in &#34;In The Air Tonight&#34; originally covered by Phil Collins - this time covered by Nonpoint) that those that grew-up watching the original series will follow Michael Mann's unique storytelling style.  Those that are not familiar with the original will enjoy this film as it is a traditional &#34;tent pole&#34; film in that there is a lot of action sequences, explosions, and fast paced sequences that summer blockbusters tout.

1025208,A3DD70OOO17HHZ,B000J4QWM2,"Declan Gallagher ""D""","[6, 12]","When one thinks 'Miami Vice', you think pastels, fast cars, constant action, and hip music. Now, thanks to this misguided ""reimagining"" of the hit 1980's TV show, when people think 'Miami Vice', they're going to think boring talk about drugs and not much else. To its credit, 'Vice' has a good soundtrack and some explosive action (some being the key word), but once it hits the half hour mark it becomes a mess of characters, locations, and drug deals that, unfortunately, never go bad (if they did maybe there would be a little action). 'Miami Vice' starts with a bang...literally, with a smackdown in a crowded nightclub, similar to the shootout in the crowded nightclub in 'Collateral'.There is no telling my immense dissapointment with this movie. It starts great, with the aformentioned fist fight and a shootout. The previews for the movie were full of scenes and images of action, and so much of that is not even in the movie at all that one may think it was merely shot for the preview. Evidentally, this movie was originally 146 minutes long. It's now been cut down to 130 minutes, missing, from what I've heard, a boat chase and many lines of dialogue, including some whole scenes, including the one from the trailer where Colin Farell puts a grenade on the table while interrogating someone and tells them ""Violence is real expensive."" The acting in the movie is OK. Jamie Foxx and Colin Farell, playing, respectively, Ricardo Tubbs and Sonny Crockett, never speak to each other, and Naomie Harris plays Tubbs' girlfriend Trudy. By the end of the movie, she has gone through such beatings (such as being captured and beaten by white supremacists and having a bomb strapped to her that detonates, but not to devastating affect) that the viewer (should) feel like they have gone through the beatings with her. But instead, we don't really care.The movie goes for shock value, like having KKK members and Nazi's involved in the plot, but it would have been more shocking if they weren't cookie cutter villains. Instead of threatening to shoot Trudy in the head, maybe they could have shot her, and then everyone watching would be shocked, instead of bemused by the fact that we all knew what was gonna happen. The villains are so generic that I couldn't tell them apart. I felt as if I was watching a foreign film, because I couldn't keep track of the characters. The plot is also incredibly hard to follow. This is an actual line of dialogue from the movie:""We got five kilos on the table. If you want, take them, but our men are gonna be behind you, taking your G's for our kilo's. If you really want this smack, you're gonna tell you're boys here to take they're *expletive deleted* guns off of us and take the stuff. But let me lay this out there. We got five K for ten G, twenty G buy you ten, thirty buy you 25. You want this, it's yours. For a price, for a discount.""Did that make any sense to anyone? Anyone? OK, I proved my point.The plot, from what I could gather, has Crockett and Tubbs going undercover to infiltrate a ruthless drug dealer, who somehow has ties to the KKK. Crockett gets into a relationship with the dealers girlfriend Isabella (Gong Li, who's English is so bad that she just starts pretending to be retarded eventually). The plot is non-stop talk for an hour and a half, until a drug and money trade is set up and by default there is a big showdown.I have nothing against talkative movies. I thoroughly enjoyed 'Little Miss Sunshine', and there was no action in that. Well very little. As I recall there was some reckless driving. Woo! Exilarating! My problem with this movie was that it made no sense, and it was just extremely boring. I almost fell asleep, and I saw it in the early afternoon. There is a character who is killed off in the first ten minutes who evidentally has something very important to do with the plot, but he is never mentioned again. Michael Mann has made some great movies. 'Collateral' is one of my all time favorites, and so is 'Heat.' But this movie assaulted the original series, which is odd because this movie was written by Mann, who produced the original series. There could have been some great action sequences. There were many oppurtunities for car chases and even an airplane chase, but they are thrown away. The movies falls apart under its own heavy handedness. 'Miami Vice' wants to say something about America's current political climate, but instead, it just feels forced, and no message is ever made clear. By my dissapointment with the movie, that is not to say there is no action. There's an amazing, multi-stage gun battle at the end, which has some of the best stunts I've seen in a movie in a long time. The simplicity of the whole scene, with people shooting from behind cars and hiding behind dumpsters, makes the movie almost worthwhile. Instead of using lots of CGI and slow motion, Mann uses none and constructs a great shootout sequence. It's not better than 'Heat' or 'Collateral', but it's right up there. It's been a long time since a movie has gotten a reaction out of me, but this one did. In the final shootout, amongst all the chaos, one death stands out. I won't give away who it was, or who killed him, but the way it was done was genius: two men exchange gun fire, and one of the men is shot, splattering blood and matter all over the wall behind him. He swivels around, and we see that his entire back has been blown off, as has a large part of his chest. It's the only time in recent memory that a movie made me go ""Oh my God!""I gave the movie two stars simply for the action. Again, I stress that I didn't just go for the action. There are lots of movies with no action that I like, but what happened here was that I went expecting an action movie, not a movie that I really had to focus on and might lose track of if I look away for even a second. Perhaps that was my mistake, not fully knowing what the movie was. But as I see it now, this movie is a huge dissapointment.Runtime: 2 hours and 10 minutesRating: R, for strong bloody violence, language, drug material, and some sexual content.",2,"'Miami Vice' Is Low

You know these people are dirt but some of them are so personable that you want them to get away with it.  Michael Mann did another ""Heat"" featuring DeNiro & Pachino with ""Miami vice"".  The action was intense, the plot allthough fairly simple gives a look at the big business surrounding the drug trafficking trade.  The sophistication and the tools that the underworld employs is impressive and Michael shows us this in an easy to follow and understand way.

1025211,A2XSGVBHS37L2B,B000J4QWM2,"D. Mills ""WatchThis""","[0, 1]","With expectations running high for this cinematic treatment of a cultural icon of 1980s television, there was bound to be some controversy surrounding Michael Mann's 2+ hour widescreen extravaganza. Lurking somewhere beneath the breathtaking but drawn out scenes, and the occasional longeurs as the action went slack, there is probably a four-star movie. What Mann needed was something more of an internal censor and some deft editing to trim the fat.Other viewers have tended to stress the differences between the TV series and this movie. As far as I'm concerned, the film picks up on alot of the series: in mood, this is close to Season 3 of the TV show, when, much to its benefit, the small screen series went serious and gritty, producing some of its most consistent plotlines and drama. Unfortunately, the movie suffers from a need for taut editing and transitions, something that plagued the first season of the series. Mann seemed to get the knack as the series went on, but here he's back to the scenes that linger just a bit to long, and transitions that come along with a whimper instead of a bang. This can be excused once or twice, but add this up over more than 120 minutes and you the viewer are catching on to the fact that with some judicious post-production attention, this could have been more riveting, and pared down to about 1hr 45mins without losing the dramatic thread.Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell slip into their roles as Crockett and Tubbs with considerable stature. Foxx's Tubbs has been reworked from the series version with Philip Michael Thomas, with positive results. Foxx seems tough and intense, every bit Farrell's equal (Thomas's Tubbs, and his too-cool-for-school persona, verged on the annoying, and he was definitely second fiddle to Don Johnson). Sadly, there is more slackness in the movie's lack of a backstory. In the series, we know that Tubbs' brother had been killed in New York at the hand of drug lord he would battle off and on in Miami. Crockett, too, had some history of his own, and several bad girlfriend situations. If this movie was hell-bent on exceeding two hours, it could have been filled with something that makes us connect with our two good guys. As it was, I left the film not really caring what happened to any of the principals.In sum, this is a visual treat that showcases some of Michael Mann's talents. If you are new to this franchise, check out the series first. It will help you project some care and concern for the two main players, something - sadly - the movie fails to accomplish on its own.The DVD package is a nice presentation, filled with some meaty 'making-ofs' and interviews.

There's the title, the names of the two main characters, it was filmed somewhere that vaguely looked like Miami.  Other than that there was nothing that connected this weak movie to his original series.  This flim was an insult.  Unfortunately, the director insulted himself.  How weird.  As to the main actors, they just didn't fill the suits.  From the tabloids: 'Crocket' in this movie was played completely stoned drunk the entire shooting.  He checked into rehab immediately after filming ended.  If being drunk out of your mind is the only way he could capture the essence of this role, I pity him.  Otherwise, he looked like a bleached, sawed off, fancy dressed version of a mimic of a clown that tried in desperation to capture what the original Crockett brought every week to that great TV series.  The film's romance had no connection, no fire, no passion.  It's set up was completely unbelievable, and, it's ethnicity, considering the location - there are places in Miami that don't speak english, only spanish - was odd.  But finally, where did the budget go?  Mann used the same settings as backdrops for different unconnected scenes.  The opening sequence is confusing.  They meet up on a roof.  They drive off.  Their captain phones them to meet him at a special secret meeting place.  They meet him back on that same roof they left hours ago.  How weird.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","For the record, I have never seen the original ""Miami Vice"" TV show, since I was a very small child when it originally came out.So be assured that the movie adaptation of ""Miami Vice"" -- produced, directed and written by the series' producer Michael Mann -- does not induce fan-rage in me. It fails not as an adaptation, but as an interesting movie. It's an astoundingly realistic and gritty movie, but it also has almost no tension or excitement... and it piles on a truckload of Hollywood cliches.While pursuing a pimp at a Miami nightclub, ""Sonny"" Crockett ( Colin Farrell) and ""Rico"" Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) are called out by an informant who has been working for the FBI. The guy commits suicide when he discovers that a Colombian cartel has murdered his wife, but not before he reveals that somebody compromised him.With the blessing of FBI Special Agent John Fujima (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds), Sonny and Rico pose as drug smugglers who offer their services to Jose Yero (John Ortiz) and the kingpin Archangel de Jesus Montoya (Luis Tosar). Sonny starts to fall in love with Isabella (Gong Li), Montoya's girlfriend/financial advisor, but it doesn't take long for everything to go belly-up for the Miami Vice partners.The problem with ""Miami Vice"" can be summed up in three words: it is BORING. There are long stretches where absolutely nothing seems to be happening, which Mann tries to fill up with an awkward Sonny/Isabella romance and lots of talking about things that MIGHT happen. In fact, the romance completely derails the whole drug-smuggling plot for awhile.I'm sure actual vice cops have long stretches of tedium in their jobs, so in that regard the movie does feel very ""real."" But it doesn't make for compelling cinema if the first eighty percent of your movie is devoid of tension or action -- and some rockin' soundtrack choices do not inject the much-needed excitement into these scenes.Admittedly this movie is very grittily realistic, with lots of shakycam and grimy, murky standoffs, as if you had followed the cops into their confrontations with a video camera. But that sense of realism is totally undermined by a bunch of Hollywood staples -- the love interest in peril, the forbidden romance with the villain's mistress, the random explosions, and so on. It just snaps you out of the experience.Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are actually pretty decent in their roles. But they both look sort of confused and underwhelmed, and for some reason Farrell often sounds like he's trying to channel Christian Bale's Batman voice. As for Gong Li, she is bafflingly miscast -- I don't really know why a Chinese actress (with a thick accent) was cast as a Cuban.""Miami Vice"" aims for a gritty, realistic approach, but the Hollywood tropes and total lack of tension leave it a pale, lifeless mess.

Look up some old tapes of the episodes ""Prodigal Son"" or ""Freefall"".Mann has tried to insist that this is a new product entirely, but he is fooling himself and everyone else (and actually, the TV series hit its stride after Mann became less directly involved).The plot simply doesn't go anywhere. The politics make no sense (white supremacists? Chinese/Cuban what?), and worst of all, nothing about today's drug war, today's Bush era geopolitics, is addressed.

Can be, but in MIAMI VICE there doesn't seem to be a script to follow...Some of the more exciting actors in the field today were employed to deliver this movie about drug deals, undercover agents, and lots of violence, but they are wooden and seem to be reading their few lines from a TV prompter.  There is just no character development to speak of, no camaraderie between Rico and Sonny - factor that made the old TV show watchable.

Jamie Foxx does an excellent acting job, but Colin Farrell did not seem to always express the correct emotions. The story begins with an undercover job gone bad resulting in a death. Farrell and Foxx insist upon stepping in if their undercover work is not revealed because they suspect that someone in the police agencies is revealing information to the criminals. Farrell makes some rather foolish mistakes, principally falling for one of the outlaws, a rather attractive woman, and displays his emotions, a kiss, in a public area. One of his associates is captured and hurt badly. The woman he is attracted to is also captured.

Gone were the bright lights, deco colors and leisure jackets of the 80's.  This was a decidedly more serious look at the world of crime that hits Miami like a tidal wave during peak crime season.  However, Miami was less the focus than the fallout zone of this crime wave, as most of the action takes place in South American and Carribean locales like Haiti, Cuba and Paraguay.Crockett and Tubbs go by Sonny and Rico in this movie.  There isn't much non-chalance in Sonny's demeanor, as portrayed by Colin Farrell, who takes the lead in this movie.  Jamie Foxx looks buff and very much in control as Rico, able to inspire much more confidence in the character than had Philip Michael Thomas.  The Vice squad looks more like a SWAT team with their heavy arsenal and sophisticated surveillance equipment, as they take over where the FBI had failed in busting up an international drugs and arms cartel that stretches from South American to Russia.Li Gong plays a Chinese-Cuban who is at the center of the cartel, which Sonny and Rico hope to break open.  Always sensuous, Li Gong comes across as a soft target in this movie, as Sonny gets deeper and deeper into the mob activities. Jamie Foxx plays things closer to home in his love interest, Naomie Harris, who is part of the vice squad.The movie is very intimate in its cinematography, shot mostly in the dark or in grainy daylight and interior settings.  I don't think the sun shone once in this movie, as there always seemed to be a dark cloud floating overhead, with the flashing of lightning and crackle of thunder.  It was more similar to Mann's Heat than it was his original television series.  So, those expecting to see something of that 80's feel will be disappointed.  But, it is well done if a bit too earnest in its approach.

1025245,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B000J4QWM2,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[0, 2]","This remake of the 80s hit TV Show has the distinction of being written and directed by the creator of the original series.  And thankfully, it's nothing like the original.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Don Johnson and Phillip Michael Thomas playing Crockett and Tubbs as they entering the seedy underworld of narcotics trafficking and trying to make the big bust to put the bad guys behind bars.  But if you look at it now, it doesn't hold up well with time.In this version, creator/writer/director Michael Mann, who has proven time and again that he is an A list director, takes something that you know he's been itching to re-explore and does it with style and grace.  His list of films include The Last of The Mohicans, The Insider, Collateral, Ali and the near perfect DeNiro/Pachino drama, Heat.  A stellar list to be sure, but here he goes back to playing with an old toy, updating it to the next millennia.Now the players are more serious, more realistic.  It's darker, it's grittier and it finds the frightening underbelly of Miami in so many scenes.  In this version Sonny and Rico (instead of Crockett and Tubbs) stumble on the breakdown of the identity of a snitch who's now working for the Feds.  Before they can help him he steps into traffic and kills himself.  From here, they work their way into the good graces of a drug runner who outsources his transportation.  Yes, even in the drug business, there is outsourcing.  The method of gaining trust is tense and the process is slow and arduous.  But the movie has a brisk pace and the action sequences are well done.Collen Farrell (Sonny Crockett) and Jamie Foxx (Ricardo Tubbs) play their roles in solid form.  In an effort to distance their characters from the show, Mann has written them differently.  Rico is smart and level headed, much more like the senior of the two.  Crockett is slick and hotheaded at times but never over the edge.  They are surrounded by characters who support their deep cover operations and they are obviously well trained and well informed.  If there are groups of vice cops like this, I feel a lot better.With this recreation, Mann has shown what he would have liked to have done in the TV Series.  There were always discussions about the realism of the series and some might question it here as well.  But where the TV show was flashy and colorful, the movie is a glimpse of how shady and dangerous the life of a Vice cop can be and how close to the edge they get when dealing with the kind of people who run these businesses.",4,M.I.N.A. - Miami vice In Name Alone.,1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,2526,"['remake', '80s', 'hit', 'TV', 'Show', 'distinction', 'being', 'written', 'directed', 'creator', 'original', 'series', 'thankfully', 'nothing', 'original', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'enjoyed', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'Phillip', 'Michael', 'Thomas', 'playing', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'entering', 'seedy', 'underworld', 'narcotics', 'trafficking', 'trying', 'make', 'big', 'bust', 'put', 'bad', 'guys', 'bars', 'look', 'now', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'time.In', 'version', 'creator/writer/director', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'who', 'proven', 'time', 'again', 'A', 'list', 'director', 'something', 'know', 'been', 'itching', 're-explore', 'style', 'grace', 'list', 'films', 'include', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'Insider', 'Collateral', 'Ali', 'near', 'perfect', 'DeNiro/Pachino', 'drama', 'Heat', 'stellar', 'list', 'be', 'sure', 'here', 'back', 'playing', 'old', 'toy', 'updating', 'next', 'millennia.Now', 'players', 'are', 'more', 'serious', 'more', 'realistic', 'darker', 'grittier', 'frightening', 'underbelly', 'Miami', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'version', 'Sonny', 'Rico', 'instead', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'stumble', 'breakdown', 'identity', 'snitch', 'who', 'now', 'working', 'Feds', 'can', 'help', 'traffic', 'here', 'work', 'way', 'good', 'graces', 'drug', 'runner', 'who', 'transportation', 'Yes', 'even', 'drug', 'business', 'outsourcing', 'method', 'gaining', 'trust', 'tense', 'process', 'slow', 'arduous', 'movie', 'brisk', 'pace', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'well', 'done.Collen', 'Farrell', 'Sonny', 'Crockett', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Ricardo', 'Tubbs', 'play', 'roles', 'solid', 'form', 'effort', 'distance', 'characters', 'show', 'Mann', 'written', 'differently', 'Rico', 'smart', 'level', 'headed', 'much', 'more', 'senior', 'two', 'Crockett', 'slick', 'hotheaded', 'times', 'never', 'edge', 'are', 'surrounded', 'characters', 'who', 'support', 'deep', 'cover', 'operations', 'are', 'obviously', 'well', 'trained', 'well', 'informed', 'are', 'groups', 'vice', 'cops', 'feel', 'lot', 'better.With', 'recreation', 'Mann', 'shown', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'done', 'TV', 'Series', 'were', 'always', 'discussions', 'realism', 'series', 'might', 'question', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'where', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'flashy', 'colorful', 'movie', 'glimpse', 'how', 'shady', 'dangerous', 'life', 'Vice', 'cop', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'close', 'edge', 'get', 'when', 'dealing', 'kind', 'people', 'who', 'run', 'businesses']",N/A

""A New Yorker""","[1, 5]","Never having been a fan of the TV series (but I confess to never having seen an entire episode), I had no expectations going in, except to be entertained with Mann's customary flair for terse dialogue and stunning visuals. And on that level, I wasn't disappointed. I'd also read that the film wastes no time establishing any back story for the uninitiated, and so it proves. In Zen-like fashion Crockett and Tubbs simply ARE, which allows the film to kick off in the thick of the action.The best way to watch this film is as a police procedural, with a side order of oddly yearning romanticism. No concessions are made to the audience in terms of explaining the cops terminology and the limited exposition is justified as one group of criminals explaining how their operation works to their new collaborators. Once you realize that you don't have to register every nuance and detail to appreciate the plot, you can sit back and enjoy some eerily beautiful Hi-Def cinematography. Petrol-heads and fans of unfeasibly fast motorboats will also find much to enjoy. The ""mojitos in Havana"" romantic interlude was a pleasant surprise, with Farrell having to flex more than just his eyebrows to convince us that this probably is the ultimate first date.The jury's still out for me on Mann's use of music. The blaring MOR rock fits stylistically but can cheapen some scenes. And it would be nice to more scenes sound tracked by near-silence, as is achieved very effectively in a stake-out/rescue scenario later in the film. Farrell and Foxx do work well together, indeed its refreshing to have a cop pairing without all the cutesy buddy stuff. Nevertheless, when one tells the other ""I will never doubt you"" it's almost a statement of love, coming as it does out of a void of professionalism.The parallel-plotting is a little overdone, with not one but two ""lover in jeopardy"" scenes and the dialogue could have been better layered/mixed for clarity, given the obscure nature of some of the procedural references. However, much of the dialogue was laugh-aloud funny in its Mamet-like moments and Mann's action direction is of course superb.Miami Vice is enjoyable but not as emotionally involving as Heat or as kinetic as Collateral.",4,[3.5]-This movie has a triumph of style over substance.,1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,2225,"['Never', 'having', 'been', 'fan', 'TV', 'series', 'confess', 'never', 'having', 'seen', 'entire', 'episode', 'had', 'expectations', 'going', 'be', 'entertained', 'Mann', 'customary', 'flair', 'terse', 'dialogue', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'level', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', ""'d"", 'also', 'read', 'film', 'time', 'establishing', 'back', 'story', 'uninitiated', 'so', 'Zen-like', 'fashion', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'simply', 'ARE', 'film', 'kick', 'off', 'thick', 'action.The', 'best', 'way', 'watch', 'film', 'police', 'procedural', 'side', 'order', 'oddly', 'yearning', 'romanticism', 'concessions', 'are', 'made', 'audience', 'terms', 'explaining', 'cops', 'terminology', 'limited', 'exposition', 'justified', 'one', 'group', 'criminals', 'explaining', 'how', 'operation', 'works', 'new', 'collaborators', 'Once', 'realize', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'register', 'nuance', 'detail', 'appreciate', 'plot', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'eerily', 'beautiful', 'Hi-Def', 'cinematography', 'Petrol-heads', 'fans', 'unfeasibly', 'fast', 'motorboats', 'will', 'also', 'find', 'much', 'enjoy', 'mojitos', 'Havana', 'romantic', 'interlude', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Farrell', 'having', 'flex', 'more', 'just', 'eyebrows', 'convince', 'probably', 'ultimate', 'first', 'date.The', 'jury', 'still', 'out', 'Mann', 'use', 'music', 'blaring', 'MOR', 'rock', 'fits', 'stylistically', 'can', 'cheapen', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'more', 'scenes', 'sound', 'tracked', 'near-silence', 'achieved', 'very', 'effectively', 'stake-out/rescue', 'scenario', 'later', 'film', 'Farrell', 'Foxx', 'do', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'indeed', 'refreshing', 'have', 'cop', 'pairing', 'cutesy', 'buddy', 'stuff', 'Nevertheless', 'when', 'one', 'other', 'will', 'never', 'doubt', 'almost', 'statement', 'love', 'coming', 'void', 'professionalism.The', 'parallel-plotting', 'little', 'overdone', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'lover', 'jeopardy', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'layered/mixed', 'clarity', 'given', 'obscure', 'nature', 'procedural', 'references', 'However', 'much', 'dialogue', 'was', 'laugh-aloud', 'funny', 'Mamet-like', 'moments', 'Mann', 'action', 'direction', 'course', 'superb.Miami', 'Vice', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'Heat', 'as', 'kinetic', 'Collateral']",N/A
1025247,A2JXM2910HL9FY,B000J4QWM2,"JG ""Jake""","[7, 9]","After being disappointed by the flicks that were marketed to kickstart summer 2006 into high-gear (movies such as Mission Impossible III, X-Men 3, The Da Vinci Code, and the somewhat bloated Pirates 2) comes Miami Vice, the (in my opinion) the best and unfortunately the most unfairly received movie of the summer. And it really is a shame, because this one has so much merit lurking in the grainy high-definition universe Mann has rendered it in.Michael Mann is definitely one of my favorite directors, so this review will sound biased, so I'll be as objective as possible.When I went to go see this, prior to watching it, many people who had seen it already were grumbling about the movie, calling it crap and a waste of time, this could only mean one of two things. 1 - The movie is actually bad. 2 - It it too artistic and cinematic. And when the final reel ended, fortunately it was latter.People slag Miami Vice either because it doesn't adopt the stylistic conventions of the universe it was born in. This includes pastel suits, shoes without socks, synth-heavy themes, etc... But here is the thing you have to remember, this is 2006, not the mid-to-late '80s. If anything we should be thanking Michael Mann for this. Mann successfully reinvents the show so as to fit into the modern times of Miami. The use of high-definition film, hand-held cameras, tense editing, and modern club-music and electronic, a tense world that exists in glarring overpowering white light, and deceptive and dangerous black shadows is created. From the first frames to the final fade we are fully submerged into this universe where it seems that something terrible is bound to happen. To simply go back to the '80s style would've basically been recycling '80s, and lets face it, the '80s are long over. I've had many people coming up to me after viewing this movie and saying how it is exactly like Miami in real life. To be able to portray and get the feeling of a real life setting and put it on screen and immerse the audience in it is a skill only the most talented filmmakers have.The movie has also been slagged for being all talk and no action. People expected a big action movie where the buddies always have a big adventures, do death-defying stunts, get the girl in the end, and save the world (or the day) from something bad. But you should never judge a book by it's cover. Crockett and Tubbs are just two Vice Squad officers doing their jobs, not invincible heroes. Crockett is a brooding guy who's job has consumed his personal life and while working undercover falls in love with a member of the drug cartel (Isabella) which he is trying to bring down. Ultimately though, Crockett has to choose between his professional life with the Vice Squad, and his personal life with Issabella, who is high up in the drug trade. Tubbs has the same sort of conflict, falling in love with a fellow detective, giving him a major vulnerability in his line of work. Crockett and Tubbs are fully developed characters played perfectly by Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx. The plot is at times hard to follow, but it is delivered in such a way that one discovers more and more with each repeated viewing. If you're looking for the typical action movie formula, you will probably hate this movie. Following suit of post 9/11 movies like Munich, Syriana, and Good Night and Good Luck, Mann chooses to take an uncompromising, unforgiving take on society and what's wrong with it. Because in real life, the good guy doesn't always get the girl, sometimes things don't make sense, and one is always facing some form of conflict.This is just picking out the obvious from the film, but there are many more aspects of this movie which have yet to surface. Like any good movie, this one rewards the viewer on repeated viewings. Much more so than any other film Mann has ever released. This may not be Mann's best film, but it's by far the best major movie to come out of Hollywood this summer.",5,Best Movie of the Summer 2006 Season,1154563200,"08 3, 2006",2006,3962,"['being', 'disappointed', 'flicks', 'were', 'marketed', 'kickstart', 'summer', '2006', 'high-gear', 'movies', 'such', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'III', 'X-Men', '3', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'somewhat', 'bloated', 'Pirates', '2', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'opinion', 'best', 'unfortunately', 'most', 'unfairly', 'received', 'movie', 'summer', 'really', 'shame', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'merit', 'lurking', 'grainy', 'high-definition', 'universe', 'Mann', 'rendered', 'in.Michael', 'Mann', 'definitely', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'review', 'will', 'sound', 'biased', 'so', ""'ll"", 'be', 'as', 'objective', 'possible.When', 'went', 'go', 'see', 'prior', 'watching', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'already', 'were', 'grumbling', 'movie', 'calling', 'crap', 'waste', 'time', 'could', 'only', 'mean', 'one', 'two', 'things', '1', 'movie', 'actually', 'bad', '2', 'too', 'artistic', 'cinematic', 'when', 'final', 'reel', 'ended', 'fortunately', 'was', 'latter.People', 'slag', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'either', ""n't"", 'adopt', 'stylistic', 'conventions', 'universe', 'was', 'born', 'pastel', 'suits', 'shoes', 'socks', 'synth-heavy', 'themes', 'etc', 'here', 'thing', 'have', 'remember', '2006', 'not', 'mid-to-late', ""'80s"", 'anything', 'should', 'be', 'thanking', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'Mann', 'successfully', 'show', 'so', 'fit', 'modern', 'times', 'Miami', 'use', 'high-definition', 'film', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'tense', 'editing', 'modern', 'club-music', 'electronic', 'tense', 'world', 'glarring', 'overpowering', 'white', 'light', 'deceptive', 'dangerous', 'black', 'shadows', 'created', 'first', 'frames', 'final', 'fade', 'are', 'fully', 'submerged', 'universe', 'where', 'something', 'terrible', 'bound', 'happen', 'simply', 'go', 'back', ""'80s"", 'style', 'would', ""'ve"", 'basically', 'been', 'recycling', ""'80s"", 'face', ""'80s"", 'are', 'long', ""'ve"", 'had', 'many', 'people', 'coming', 'up', 'viewing', 'movie', 'saying', 'how', 'exactly', 'like', 'Miami', 'real', 'life', 'be', 'able', 'portray', 'get', 'feeling', 'real', 'life', 'setting', 'put', 'screen', 'immerse', 'audience', 'skill', 'only', 'most', 'talented', 'filmmakers', 'have.The', 'movie', 'also', 'been', 'slagged', 'being', 'talk', 'action', 'People', 'expected', 'big', 'action', 'movie', 'where', 'buddies', 'always', 'have', 'big', 'adventures', 'do', 'death-defying', 'stunts', 'get', 'girl', 'end', 'save', 'world', 'day', 'something', 'bad', 'should', 'never', 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'Vice', 'Squad', 'officers', 'doing', 'jobs', 'not', 'invincible', 'heroes', 'Crockett', 'brooding', 'guy', 'who', 'job', 'consumed', 'personal', 'life', 'working', 'undercover', 'falls', 'love', 'member', 'drug', 'cartel', 'Isabella', 'trying', 'bring', 'down', 'Ultimately', 'Crockett', 'choose', 'professional', 'life', 'Vice', 'Squad', 'personal', 'life', 'Issabella', 'who', 'high', 'up', 'drug', 'trade', 'Tubbs', 'same', 'sort', 'conflict', 'falling', 'love', 'fellow', 'detective', 'giving', 'major', 'vulnerability', 'line', 'work', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'are', 'fully', 'developed', 'characters', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'plot', 'times', 'hard', 'follow', 'delivered', 'such', 'way', 'one', 'more', 'more', 'repeated', 'viewing', ""'re"", 'looking', 'typical', 'action', 'movie', 'formula', 'will', 'probably', 'hate', 'movie', 'Following', 'suit', 'post', '9/11', 'movies', 'Munich', 'Syriana', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Mann', 'take', 'uncompromising', 'unforgiving', 'take', 'society', 'what', 'wrong', 'real', 'life', 'good', 'guy', ""n't"", 'always', 'get', 'girl', 'sometimes', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'one', 'always', 'facing', 'form', 'conflict.This', 'just', 'picking', 'out', 'obvious', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'aspects', 'movie', 'have', 'yet', 'surface', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'viewer', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'Much', 'more', 'so', 'other', 'film', 'Mann', 'ever', 'released', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Mann', 'best', 'film', 'far', 'best', 'major', 'movie', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'summer']",N/A
1025248,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B000J4QWM2,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[1, 4]","I went to threads for the movie where a lot of people had it planned to hate it before it even came out. So the one star reviews I see here don't really surprise me. They knocked the casting from the start and I admit I also had a problem with Colin Farrell and Jamie Fox being casted. They look nothing like the original actors or even try to sound like them here. Still I can't say they are bad. Farrell gives a kickass performance either way even if he doesn't have Don Johnson's charm. I can't say that Farrell and Fox even have Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas chemestry. While their relationship with Lt. Martin Castillo here is disapointing as well. They barely even like the guy and curse at him every time they see him.Farrell however has really good chemestry with Li Gong. His relationship with her is at least faithful to the show. I mean Johnson's Crockett was always falling for girls when he was undercover. Plus they also have a sexy and cool scene on a speed boat that's faithful to the tone of the show. The shootouts are also faithful to the show even if they are a bit more violent. The show had it's romantic steamy sex scenes and so does this movie. Fox and Farrell both have shower scenes where they share the shower with a woman. Which probably weren't even needed.The look of the film is  faithful since Mann who produced the show directs here and since most of his films are little Miami Vicesish. I was hoping to at least hear the original theme music once or twice but that never happens. I forgive it for that though since I am a Michael Mann fan and was a Michael Mann fan longer than I was a Miami Vice fan. I just got into the show recently with the dvds. While Heat was one of my favorite movies for awhile. If you liked Heat and Collateral then you should also like this movie. Die hard Vice fans probably won't be as crazy about it.Crockett and Tubbs are hardly even buddy buddy in the film, they are partners and that's about it. I wouldn't mind sequels so everyone could develop a little more. How about Elizabeth Rodriguez getting more screen time as Gina. I wouldn't mind seeing her develop a relationship with Crockett like she had in the show ""although I think they only slept together once in the first episode lol"". Here they hardly even talk unless they are working together to bust or kill some bad guys. The movie is just all undercover stuff mostly and you hardly get to know them as people when they aren't undercover. This isn't a bad movie but I don't think it works if they only have one movie and that's it. It leaves you thinking of it as a pilot episode that has you waiting for more episodes....People knock how it's slow and not too much like the show but think about it. They go undercover, deal with bad guys and there's a shootout at the end....sounds like the show to me. Just don't expect music by U2 and Phil Collins or some annoying guy named Noogie.",4,Not the Show but still really good,1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,2914,"['went', 'threads', 'movie', 'where', 'lot', 'people', 'had', 'planned', 'hate', 'even', 'came', 'out', 'one', 'star', 'see', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'surprise', 'knocked', 'casting', 'start', 'admit', 'also', 'had', 'problem', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Jamie', 'Fox', 'being', 'casted', 'look', 'nothing', 'original', 'actors', 'even', 'try', 'sound', 'here', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'are', 'bad', 'Farrell', 'kickass', 'performance', 'way', 'even', ""n't"", 'have', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'charm', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Farrell', 'Fox', 'even', 'have', 'Johnson', 'Philip', 'Michael', 'Thomas', 'chemestry', 'relationship', 'Lt.', 'Martin', 'Castillo', 'here', 'disapointing', 'as', 'well', 'barely', 'even', 'guy', 'curse', 'time', 'see', 'him.Farrell', 'however', 'really', 'good', 'chemestry', 'Li', 'Gong', 'relationship', 'least', 'faithful', 'show', 'mean', 'Johnson', 'Crockett', 'was', 'always', 'falling', 'girls', 'when', 'was', 'undercover', 'also', 'have', 'sexy', 'cool', 'scene', 'speed', 'boat', 'faithful', 'tone', 'show', 'shootouts', 'are', 'also', 'faithful', 'show', 'even', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'violent', 'show', 'had', 'romantic', 'steamy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'so', 'movie', 'Fox', 'Farrell', 'have', 'shower', 'scenes', 'where', 'share', 'shower', 'woman', 'probably', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'needed.The', 'look', 'film', 'faithful', 'Mann', 'who', 'produced', 'show', 'here', 'most', 'films', 'are', 'little', 'Miami', 'Vicesish', 'was', 'hoping', 'least', 'hear', 'original', 'theme', 'music', 'once', 'twice', 'never', 'forgive', 'am', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'fan', 'was', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'fan', 'longer', 'was', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'fan', 'just', 'got', 'show', 'recently', 'dvds', 'Heat', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'awhile', 'liked', 'Heat', 'Collateral', 'then', 'should', 'also', 'like', 'movie', 'Die', 'hard', 'Vice', 'fans', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'crazy', 'it.Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'are', 'hardly', 'even', 'buddy', 'buddy', 'film', 'are', 'partners', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'sequels', 'everyone', 'could', 'develop', 'little', 'more', 'How', 'Elizabeth', 'Rodriguez', 'getting', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Gina', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'develop', 'relationship', 'Crockett', 'had', 'show', 'think', 'only', 'slept', 'together', 'once', 'first', 'episode', 'lol', 'Here', 'hardly', 'even', 'talk', 'are', 'working', 'together', 'bust', 'kill', 'bad', 'guys', 'movie', 'just', 'undercover', 'stuff', 'mostly', 'hardly', 'get', 'know', 'people', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'undercover', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'movie', 'thinking', 'pilot', 'episode', 'waiting', 'more', 'episodes', '.People', 'knock', 'how', 'slow', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'show', 'think', 'go', 'undercover', 'deal', 'bad', 'guys', 'shootout', 'end', 'show', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'music', 'U2', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'annoying', 'guy', 'named', 'Noogie']",N/A

The Director's Cut is the version I THINK was in the theatres, and this version is slightly different.This version opens with the nightclub scene instead of the go-fast boat sequence (which is not in this version at all).  For the rest of the first half of the film it is essentially identical to the Director's Cut.In the second half, in this version there are additional scenes on the transport ship, a longer build-up to the now-extended sequence at the trailer park, and the drug sting and shootout is longer too.There is an additional sequence with Tubbs' girlfriend Trudy getting nabbed by Yero's thugs, more footage in the hospital, and a different scene where Yero informs Montoya of Isabella's relationship with Crockett.I've seen the Director's Cut several times and bought this previously-viewed DVD not knowing there was a different cut of the film.  Naturally, it was a bit disconcerting watching the second half of this one.  One side of my brain is watching and sort of enjoying the new take on it, and the other half of my brain is contemplating whether or not to buy the Director's Cut DVD too, because that was the movie I wanted to buy from the get-go.You get more bonus features with the Director's Cut.

Where do I even start with this one?  How about a basic plot summary: a couple of super-cops, who are best friends, one black the other white, are approached by shadowy FBI or DEA or Government type guys.  Apparently the FBI/DEA/whatever agents fudged up so obviously these super cops, who speed around town all day in flashy sports cars, are the only ones awesome enough to infiltrate the drug lord's inner circle.  Invariably the cops succeed, but have to deal with complications and one of cops nearly loses his way, being seduced by a woman... the drug lord's girlfriend.  Sound familiar?One of my favorite exchanges was halfway in, when Foxx says to Farrell, ""So what's going on?"" Collin says, ""As in?""  Fox: ""As in there is undercover and then there is 'Which way is up?'"" Collin replies, ""You think I'm in so deep I forgot?""  Fox says ""I will never doubt you.""  Then, if I remember correctly they kiss.  I could be mistaken about that last part, but such trite Tv-cop dialogue is all this movie offers.  I'm dead serious.  Every line is terrible.  In fact, every minute of the movie is so laced with cliche you'd swear you're watching a farcical send-up of the genre...  except that the movie takes itself so seriously the dvd might have a stick up its butt.  There is at least one rather grotesquely violent scene early on, and elsewhere I got the impression Michael Mann was trying hard to make this film seem ""gritty"".Even so, most of the time I spent watching this pile I was laughing out loud at the inept writing, acting and forced chic of costumes and accessories.  The editorial reviewer here called it 'stylish,' but apart from the fact that everyone in the movie wears expensive suits, drives fast cars and has a hot girlfriend, there really is no style in evidence, only thin artifice.

1025256,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B000J4QWM2,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[0, 0]","Michael Mann is one of my favorite directors in Hollywood. Mann's unique talent to create interesting characters and great police stories is hard to match, but few things are missing in his new effort.Story:The 80s dynamic duo is now Colin Farrell (James 'Sonny' Crockett) and Jamie Foxx (Ricardo Tubbs) who are undercover cops trying to bring down drug lords who have international operations. As they work, they find themselves going deeper into their operations and things get personal after a while. That's basically it. The movie is very confusing to follow due to the ""cop talk"" and sloppy editing. Mann is known for creating excellent character development in his movies, but unfortunately that's not the case here.Review:Apparently Mann was focused more about his colorful style than the actual plot of the movie. Undoubtedly, there is some traditional ""Mann"" style cinematography that many of his fans will enjoy, but don't expect the storytelling of ""Heat"" or ""Collateral."" Some might say that there is a miscast problem. Farrell and Foxx are suitable for their rolls, but I cannot say that about Gong Li. It was hard to understand her dialogue. The movie was shot in digital video that gave Mann more freedom to shoot at night. There are some remarkable scenes where you can see clouds in the night and that's something that you can never get in traditional film. Digital filmmaking is something that Mann has been using for a while. Unlike ""Collateral,"" Mann used digital cameras even for daytime in this movie, giving it a DV camcorder look.If you want to see a movie like this, you're expecting action. When it comes to police action and drama, Mann has no match. Even though, the actions are few and far between in this movie, he delivers those scenes with crude reality and power. The last action scene of the movie is intense, it reminds us the robbery shooting from Heat.The Verdict:The 80s are gone forever. The white suit and the pastel colors are also gone. Mann delivers a raw, stylish and uncompromising film, but it lacks the storytelling and the character development that he is known for. I recommend this movie to his fans, other people, you might get bored.",4,"Mann delivers a raw, stylish and uncompromising film",1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,2185,"['Michael', 'Mann', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'Hollywood', 'Mann', 'unique', 'talent', 'create', 'interesting', 'characters', 'great', 'police', 'stories', 'hard', 'match', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'missing', 'new', 'effort.Story', '80s', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'now', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'James', ""'Sonny"", 'Crockett', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Ricardo', 'Tubbs', 'who', 'are', 'undercover', 'cops', 'trying', 'bring', 'down', 'drug', 'lords', 'who', 'have', 'international', 'operations', 'work', 'find', 'going', 'deeper', 'operations', 'things', 'get', 'personal', 'while', 'basically', 'movie', 'very', 'confusing', 'follow', 'due', 'cop', 'talk', 'sloppy', 'editing', 'Mann', 'known', 'creating', 'excellent', 'character', 'development', 'movies', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'case', 'here.Review', 'Apparently', 'Mann', 'was', 'focused', 'more', 'colorful', 'style', 'actual', 'plot', 'movie', 'Undoubtedly', 'traditional', 'Mann', 'style', 'cinematography', 'many', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'storytelling', 'Heat', 'Collateral', 'might', 'say', 'miscast', 'problem', 'Farrell', 'Foxx', 'are', 'suitable', 'rolls', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'about', 'Gong', 'Li', 'was', 'hard', 'understand', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'digital', 'video', 'gave', 'Mann', 'more', 'freedom', 'shoot', 'night', 'are', 'remarkable', 'scenes', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'clouds', 'night', 'something', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'traditional', 'film', 'Digital', 'filmmaking', 'something', 'Mann', 'been', 'using', 'while', 'Collateral', 'Mann', 'used', 'digital', 'cameras', 'even', 'daytime', 'movie', 'giving', 'DV', 'camcorder', 'look.If', 'want', 'see', 'movie', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'action', 'When', 'police', 'action', 'drama', 'Mann', 'match', 'Even', 'actions', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'movie', 'scenes', 'crude', 'reality', 'power', 'last', 'action', 'scene', 'movie', 'intense', 'robbery', 'shooting', 'Heat.The', 'Verdict', '80s', 'are', 'gone', 'forever', 'white', 'suit', 'pastel', 'colors', 'are', 'also', 'gone', 'Mann', 'raw', 'stylish', 'uncompromising', 'film', 'storytelling', 'character', 'development', 'known', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fans', 'other', 'people', 'might', 'get', 'bored']",N/A

My first reaction was to change the brightness of the picture and then the type of sound but neither action resulted in any improvement.I should state at the outset that although I watched the original show in England when it was first broadcast I have no attachment to the particular way it was produced. The world is indeed a much darker place than it was all those years ago and things have certainly changed. That said, I was pleased to see the fast boat introduction to the movie proper underscoring one of the main attractions of the show in the first instance, that being the enormous wealth, juxtaposed against some alarming rates of poverty within the Miami Dade area.From then on it was downhill all the way for me. I could hardly make out what the characters were saying for most of the time, with either the characters themselves or the poor audio tracking being the indeterminate culprit. As for the plot, it was confusing at points and it was sometimes difficule to discern the nature of relationships and even why one was at a particular juncture.  The teaming of Foxx and Farrell for me did not appear to work and the whole romantic involvement between Farrell and Li Gong which appeared to be so spiritual as well as physical dissapeared as in a puff of smoke without any tenderness or attachment on Farrell's part when it was he indeed who had made the running in the pursuit.What could have been a fast moving action drama became something of a lead balloon stretched out for far too long and one was hoping for the end long before it occurred. Clearly it weas set up for a sequel which I hope will not materialise.What was also disappointing for me was the music. Clearly it would be illogical to use the music of the time of the tv show except perhaps for an updated version of the masterful original theme, but to me the music did not match the movie in any sense of the word.Much of the inside shots were of homes where space was not an issue. In a way those shots for me symbolise the movie in one word ... vacuous.At the end I was glad it was over. It is a shame too.

1025263,AGXH8DR5LB2JK,B000J4QWM2,Kenneth B. Strumpf,"[5, 8]","I rented Miami Vice with pretty low expectations based on the reviews and my expectations were met. I have several criticisms. First, the film was badly miscast. Colin Farrell was all wrong as Crockett. His expression varied between sulk and pout throughout the movie. His accent was all wrong as well. He had the same vaguely Irish accent he had in Alexander, and you definitely don't want to be reminded of Alexander ever when watching another movie. On the plus side he did have a great permanent three-day growth of beard, like Don Johnson. Jamie Foxx was OK as Tubbs but the two together had no chemistry whatsoever. They could have been two randomly assigned partners, not two men in an intense buddy relationship.And why in the world was Li Gong cast as the main female lead? As best as I could tell she was supposed to be playing a Cuban woman yet she clearly could not speak Spanish (and maybe English as well). What gives? Why not cast an Hispanic actress in the part? Throughout the film I kept thinking ""But she's Chinese! She's not Cuban."" Very distracting and it made no sense. Plus, she and Farrell had zero chemistry together.But my biggest complaint is the casting of Barry Shabaka Henley as Castillo, my favorite character from the TV show. Totally wrong. Henley is amusing in the Aflac commercials but looks completely wrong as Castillo. The role calls for an intense actor filled with barely controlled rage, not some paunchy guy who looks like he belongs behind a desk. The scene where he's trying to locate snipers made me giggle. I kept seeing him in the floppy eared hat he wears in the Christmas Aflac commercial. Why not just cast Edward James Olmos? He still looks great and would have been perfect in the role he created. Maybe promote him to captain to explain his being older.The story itself was pretty pedestrian, the part I could follow anyway. The first 10 minutes made little sense since I couldn't understand half the dialogue. Finally I turned on the subtitles just so I could follow the plot. Everyone was intentionally overacting and the number of cliches (white supremacists, Colombian drug lords, crooked cops, the girlfriend in danger, etc) were too numerous to count.

He wanted to make the film what the show was at the time, edgy and pretty, because Mann know composition. The imagery in the original was so interesting to look at that it generated a pop-culture icon that seriously (and embarrassingly) influenced fashion. Although now the pastels and linens are gone, the high-def photography,intense edits and high action kick VICE up to Mann's usual high standards. Like Collateral he delivers in a modern setting in colors as dark and gray as Crokett and Tubbs very souls.  Colin Farrell's Crockett is okay, minus some corny lines, and Foxx's role as sidekick, makes him seem underused.The story is tricky, but merely the means to the music video ends, which is a Mann film: The pair infiltrate a cartel to scope-out a dept. leak. There's lots of drugs, some women and incidental music (no Jan Hammer though).Mann struggled with whether or not to use ""In the Air Tonight"" for one pivotal pre-battle scene (you'll have to go for yourself to see if he did.It's about what you'd expect , no more, no less...By the by, the shoot was so intense Farrell checked into rehab immediately after.",4,"Nice updated version of 80's TV milestone,",1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,1399,"['could', 'have', 'goofed', '80', 'cop', 'show', 'Bacardi', 'TV', 'spoofs', 'updated', 'big', 'screen', 'translations', 'most', 'recently', 'Bewitched', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'DUKES', 'HAZZARD.But', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'still', 'vision', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'South', 'Floridian', 'cops', 'wanted', 'make', 'film', 'what', 'show', 'was', 'time', 'edgy', 'pretty', 'Mann', 'know', 'composition', 'imagery', 'original', 'was', 'so', 'interesting', 'look', 'generated', 'pop-culture', 'icon', 'seriously', 'embarrassingly', 'influenced', 'fashion', 'now', 'pastels', 'linens', 'are', 'gone', 'high-def', 'photography', 'intense', 'edits', 'high', 'action', 'kick', 'VICE', 'up', 'Mann', 'usual', 'high', 'standards', 'Collateral', 'modern', 'setting', 'colors', 'dark', 'gray', 'Crokett', 'Tubbs', 'very', 'souls', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Crockett', 'okay', 'corny', 'lines', 'Foxx', 'role', 'sidekick', 'seem', 'underused.The', 'story', 'tricky', 'merely', 'means', 'music', 'video', 'ends', 'Mann', 'film', 'pair', 'infiltrate', 'cartel', 'scope-out', 'dept', 'leak', 'lots', 'drugs', 'women', 'incidental', 'music', 'Jan', 'Hammer', '.Mann', 'struggled', 'not', 'use', 'Air', 'Tonight', 'one', 'pivotal', 'pre-battle', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'have', 'go', 'see', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'more', 'less', 'shoot', 'was', 'so', 'intense', 'Farrell', 'checked', 'rehab', 'immediately']",N/A

I miss the beautiful lemon colored or pink suits, all the Armani, that Crockett and Tubbs used to wear on TV: those spotless pastels that made the stars look like walking, talking stacks of Necco wafers in sunglasses.  But what we get in return is richness enough.  Just the aerial scenes alone reach for the sky and into the sun itself.  You haven't seen an American film with this many clouds since the heyday of director William Wellman.I liked all the actors, except for the new Switek (Domenick Lombardozzi).  Tell me, isn't this guy in every movie or TV show produced today?  I just got sick of him on ENTOURAGE, as the lowlife ex-con pal of 4 boys who wound up stealing the original Shrek doll.  Colin Farrell fans can't avoid this bloke, for he was in PHONE BOOTH and also in SWAT, which MIAMI VICE will definitely remind you of, it's like SWAT with class, except that it also has Lombardozzi--who keeps his clothes on at least in this one so my dreams won't be haunted by the sight of those huge buttocks thrusting hundreds of times a minute as they do on ENTOURAGE.  Directors must like him (maybe Colin Farrell likes him>) because he seems like the guy next door, if you lived in Brooklyn in the 1930s, but I don't want the guy next door in my movies, even if he keeps it in his pants.Gong Li on the other hand won't be everyone's cup of tea but at least she hasn't been overexposed much in big US Hollywood movies.  She and Colin Farrell spark up the screen together, and their ride in that go-fast boat to Havana is what the movies are made for.  It skims and skips across the Caribbean as though emblematizing sexual urgency and the need to come to an orgasm.  Whew!  That is some sequence my friends!Did I miss something, or what was the point of that coded message about ""Tuesday day"" which, when revealed, showed that the leak came from within the FBI?

There's star power here too with Jamie Fox, Colin Farrell and Li Gong, and a well known director, Michael Mann.  It's also fun to go to a film on its opening night when every seat is taken in the theater.  Alas, though, the anticipation I felt was the best part of this particular film-going experience.The plot involved our heroes working with the FBI to catch some high-profile drug dealers.  The plot, however, was impossible to follow.  The dialog was mumbled.  And the film editing was cut too fast and produced scenes that didn't make any sense.  To top it all off, it was just plain boring.  There were a couple of romances, of course, but they didn't have any chemistry.  And, basically, I just didn't care.  There were a lot of fast boats and mean bad guys and an inept FBI.  And, in the end, the crime was solved to the characters' satisfaction.

Jaime Foxx plays Ricardo Tubbs and Colin Crockett plays the other undercover Vice cop, Sonny Crockett. They are in their prime, fighting crime in summer white suits.  The drug bust story is standard, but the special touches of blue lighting, windblown palm trees, boat races and chases with rushing water in almost every scene's backdrop give the movie flair and style.  Ricardo and Sonny are working hard to identify the group behind a recent string of drug-related murders.  A romance springs up between the unlikely mob's oriental businesswoman and Sonny.

1025284,A22JG2WG04EJSL,B000J4QWM2,Matthew Moses,"[1, 3]","I had vaguely wanted to see this when it was in theaters, but just never made it. Then I was reminded of it after visiting Fort Lauderdale earlier this year, and now I've seen it and I'm ready to write about it and forget it as soon as possible.The disc opens with the world's longest commercial for HD DVDs. It is a full three minutes long and contains what seems like full instructions to the many intricate and probably pointless ""features"" these discs have--like the ability to have your movie experience interrupted every few seconds by ""fun facts"" which probably run along the lines that Halle Berry really likes yogurt or some such. I was convinced never to buy an HD DVD after this commercial. Then we start the movie, hearing a throbbing undertone accompanying the Universal logo, then coming up out of the water until we see a bunch of catamaran-style speedboats racing along. I like movies that begin either underwater or in space. The boats speed along as the credits play. Apparently this whole section is new and exclusive to the director's cut, as from what I understand the theatrical version didn't even have credits. Oh yeah, did I mention that what I watched was the director's cut? But this is about the only point I'll be able to tell you how it's different from the theatrical version except I heard this one--at 2 hours and 20 minutes--is ""trimmed down.""The first half hour here is police work as sensual experience. The water, the sky, the colors of the boats, all are given loving coverage. Especially the sky; I have never seen so much beautiful cloud coverage in one movie. The clouds should seriously get a credit. We notice that the two guys are often shot with one behind the other, visually making the team into one entity. This happens in the posters and artwork, too. Anyway, then they're in a nightclub [where four different songs play one after another, like in a real club; it definitely ups the verisimilitude and makes the scenes seem longer], then there's some hugger-mugger and then they're on a roof and get a call from some undercover agent whose job is going badly. Then they meet with him, then they're put on some case in order to rat out an informer. The fact is, the first 30 minutes here are absolutely incomprehensible. I went into the rest of the movie with only the vaguest motion of what was happening and why.Then Jamie Foxx as Rico goes to make love with Trudy, his GF and also an agent. Listen to the TOTAL porn-movie music that plays as they do it. The scene goes on so long and Trudy receives so much adoring coverage that I made a little bet that she was going to die or at least be abducted by the end.Then they go undercover and have to infiltrate some drug ring or something, and when the guy questions their credentials they throw this big bluff and threaten to blow up the assembled company, including themselves. I thought, Hmmm, can I do this in job interviews? ""You want to see my portfolio? [pulls out grenade] Are you ready to meet God?""So then Rico has a talk with Trudy about how he's worried she'll be pulled into it and she tells him not to give one thought to her, but only worry about himself and Sonny, because if he thinks of her he'll be distracted and may f*** up. Pretty understanding. Then they meet the big bad guy, this semi-hot bear, and his woman Isabella, played by Gong Li. Sonny comes on hard to Isabella, quite inexplicably and unadvisedly, and they take the speedboat to Cuba for a Mojito. There they listen to music, dance, and make mad passionate love. Then they make a sub-deal to betray the big gangster and get out of the game.By this time one has noted that they are able to have perfectly clear cell phone conversations while in open boats traveling at high speed. And that the look of this is inextricable [which influenced which is debatable] with the Grand Theft Auto video games. And around an hour into it I thought: ""You know, I'm getting really bored.""SPOILERS > > >So a bunch of other standard cops and robbers stuff happens and, as expected, Trudy gets taken hostage. The guys divert from their plan and rescue her, after which she stupidly walks back into the trailer she was held in, which explodes, throwing her forward and leaving her in a coma and with burns over 15% of her body. Why did she go back in? Whatever. Then there's a big showdown shootout and the bad guys are killed, the good guys win, Isabella goes back to Cuba and coma girl shows signs of life.&lt; &lt; &lt; SPOILERSIt's a gorgeous blank. I don't know, I'm often not into cops and robbers movies, and this one I found a little more alienating than most. The first problem is that since the first 30 minutes are absolutely incomprehensible, no emotional connection is formed--you can't even tell what's going on. And for the rest of the movie only the barest outline of plot could be made out [by me--maybe I'm just really thick], which also keeps one disengaged. It works in a James Bond movie where you don't have to follow the plot, just watch the parade of luxury items and action pieces, but this movie seems to be going for a deep dive into the emotional lives of these cops, but it just remained distant from me. The other alienator is that I still have no clue what the basis of Sonny and Isabella's relationship is supposed to be. Why would he take this massive risk over a woman he just met, but suddenly is all passionate about? Is it just lust? I didn't engage in any of it, which left the last hour and twenty minutes as just images passing on a screen.It is, however, very beautiful. I don't think I've ever seen such attention paid to clouds and water and surfaces before. I think maybe he was going for this kind of haze of impressions that defines the high-stakes police experience, this kind of mental dislocation all these shifting alliances and identities leave in their agents, but after awhile character emotional distance results in audience emotional distance. Oh, and the characters never, ever seem to sleep.",2,I've seen clouds from both sides now,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,6011,"['had', 'vaguely', 'wanted', 'see', 'when', 'was', 'theaters', 'just',

1025285,A2HSFKLLQHYY6S,B000J4QWM2,Matt Skidmore,"[0, 1]","When this movie was announced, I was pretty excited. Being a fan of the 80s TV series, I was eagerly looking forward to see how the film makers would contemporise my favourite cop show and knowing that Michael Mann was at the helm, it couldn't really go wrong. However, what I got was something very different to the bright TV show of my childhood...Gone are the slick exterior and pastel clothing. Gone are the 'buddy' cop movie formula and gone are Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas. Replacing the duo are Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell (playing Ricardo 'Rico' Tubbs and 'Sonny' Crockett respectively) who attack the material in a totally different manner. They hardly share any screen time together and unlike the original show, they communicate only via knowing looks and expressions - its all done by gesture. This is pretty smart in the sense that these two know each so well, that they can get the job done just by looking at each other, but as a cinematic way of telling the story, it falls flat. The characterisation is gone and everybody seems 'oh so serious' all the time, neglecting any real humanity and ultimately you cannot connect to the people onscreen. That's not to say the movie is a failure, its just that if you are looking for a 'lethal weapon' style actioner, then you are knocking on the wrong door.Mann's 'Miami Vice' redux is a very cool and cold affair. With gritty digital camera work offering the darkest look at Miami's criminal underbelly, this summer flick is more mood and nuance than buildings being decimated. In the movie, Crockett and Tubbs are once again deep undercover infiltrating a South American drug cartel, but Crocket jepordises the entire operation by falling in love with the main villains' wife Isabella, played by Gong Li. From then on, its all meaningful looks and longing for love as the duo embark on bringing the cartel down. The script itself tries hard to be emotional and involving, but Mann's style is minimal and distancing which actually pulls you away from the drama. Its a very strange experience - as the film rolls, you expect the usual summer actioner with explosions and gunfights (you do get these, but not in the manner to which you expect), but Mann refuses to fall into those old cliches. It's as if he created the 80s, neon lit, orange skyline 'Jerry Bruckheimer look' with the original Miami Vice, but now disregards it and follows his own beat.The score is excellent, and (as he did with 'Collateral') Mann shoots the movie in hig def giving it a gritty, urban and decayed feel. The cast are uniformly good, but the style of the piece takes some getting used to, as do their performances. Watching the film once doesn't give you a satisfactory viewing - you need to see it a few times to 'get' the movie.Universals' DVD transfer is excellent and the movie and audio are great.

While there is already an established audience that will follow the movie from the show, the inevitable comparison's between the two will cause a lot of criticism, and may yield and unhappy critical and box office return.  Such is the case with Miami Vice.  Here, Michael Mann, who had a hand in the great original show, decided to create a very dark and realistic modern take on the beloved characters, which resulted in a split amongst fans.  I wonder how the reaction would be for Miami Vice, had Michael Mann instead did what he did with Heat, which is itself a remake of his show Crime Story but turned into a more modern and dark movie, but without the stigma of comparison.  Similarly, I wonder what would have happened if there wasn't so much behind the scene drama of the actors involved.The trouble is we'll never know.  Which is a shame, as Miami Vice is a dark and gritty cop drama, involving dark themes and moral ambiguity that is seen in more dark films, but is usually not something fans expect from something titled Miami Vice.  The movie is not without flaws, I never bought the romance between Farrell and Gong Li, but much like the bleak world that exists in the drug trade, this movie is not meant to show heart.  Rather, its meant to show the real world.  If you're looking for a gritty crime thriller, akin to Heat or Collateral, then you'll find much to like with Miami Vice.

And most of what unfolds is good but some is not.First of all, with all the talk between Sonny and Ricardo about having each others back and ""I will never doubt you"" talk, there is very little real chemistry between the two and almost no sense that these two are friends which is an absolute prerequisite for partners working undercover. This is partly the screenplay of course but it is primarily in the performances: Sonny and Ricardo in this context do not show anything amounting to affection towards or concern about each other and this damages the film.Another problem is Li Gong (as Isabella, love interest to both Sonny and Drug Lord, Jesus). Though an incredible actress and eye-popping screen presence in her native China (Check out ""Temptress Moon"" and ""Farewell My Concubine"") she is mostly stilted and unintelligible here particularly in comparison to her sublime Hatsumono in ""Memoirs of a Geisha.""

1025294,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000J4QWM2,mirasreviews,"[5, 7]","Michael Mann brings ""Miami Vice"" to the big screen with this gritty 21st century makeover of the stylish 1984-1989 television series that he created. Miami vice squad detectives Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) lead lives deep undercover, sporting multilayered false identities, living in safe houses, hunting pimps and drug dealers. When some federal agents are killed in a drug buy, FBI Special Agent Fujima (Ciaran Hinds) solicits Miami Vice's help in finding the culprits and the source of their intelligence. Crockett and Tubbs go undercover as cocaine importers, hoping to make a delivery to the white supremacist organization that murdered the feds. In order to get the product from the drug tzar (Luis Tosar) in South America, Sonny and Rico must get past his security specialist Jose Yero (John Ortiz) and gain the trust of his money manager Isabella (Gong Li).If you liked the ""Miami Vice"" television show, don't count on liking this movie. Character development is nonexistent, it's never clear what the agents' goals are, people speak in strange clipped phrases, and the visual style is murky. The cinematography by Dion Beebe is technically impressive, in particular his deep focus with striking backgrounds and dark foregrounds. But the overwhelming darkness doesn't serve the film well. The Miami of pastels and art deco that we saw on television in the 1980's was new and interesting. The MTV-style editing was invigorating. The dark, gritty look and disorienting shaky camera of this film have been de rigueur in action movies for 5 years now. They are passe, and they are an impediment to engaging the audience. The frenetic editing is incoherent.With far too many scenes that have no purpose, ""Miami Vice"" moves too slowly and lasts too long for an action movie. The ""director's cut"" DVD is 6 minutes longer than the theatrical release, at 2 hours 20 minutes. Both versions are director-approved, in fact, and both are too long. The ""director's cut"" is a later edit. I can't say much for the stars of ""Miami Vice"". Jamie Foxx and his furrowed brow -that would surely give Tubbs away- are unconvincing. Colin Farrell fares only slightly better. Crockett's mustache and Tubbs' beard are creepy. I can't begin to guess the motives behind so much facial hair. Gong Li is showing her age, but has a great deal of presence. John Ortiz makes Yero intriguing. I would have liked to see more of these two, but the rest of the cast is like wallpaper. I won't even get into the botched accents. A much tighter edit and better dialogue would have helped. I'm giving ""Miami Vice"" 3 stars for interesting locations, well-choreographed action, and few compelling scenes.The DVD (Universal 2006 Director's Cut): ""Miami Vice Undercover"" (12 min) includes interviews with cast and former undercover agents about the nature of undercover work. ""Miami and Beyond: Shooting on Location"" (9 min) takes us to location shoots in Ciudad del Este in Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, and Miami. ""Visualizing Miami Vice"" (12 min) discusses the film's sets, colors, and light with cinematographer Dion Beebe and set decorator Jim Erikson, aerial shots with aerial coordinator Craig Hosking. ""Behind the Scenes Featurettes"" (10 min) are ""Gun Training"" with the cast, ""Haitian Hotel Camera Blocking"", and ""Mojo Race"", which looks at the MTI race boats built for the movie.

The name makes perfect sense for the movie, and yet it has precious little in common with the TV series from the 80's. Perhaps his point is, if he made that series now, this is how it might have looked.So what do we get - it is a serious and intelligent portrayal of the drugs business in Miami. In some ways it is closer to 'Traffic' in showing the mechanics of how it all happens, rather than a thriller like `Heat' for which Mann is better known. Only at the end do we get a shoot out, in full Michael Mann style. Farrell and Foxx do not make a buddy movie - these are long standing partners who barely need to speak, they know and understand each other already, and we do not see the bonding process. Otherwise, this movie is all about process, and little about the characters. Instead, the plot focuses on the team's infiltration of a large drug running organisation, posing as boat runners.The only real venture into characterisation is the wonderful Gong Li, the Cuban Chinese wife of the main villain. Although not the star of the movie, she steals many of the scenes - perhaps it is just in Mann's nature to flesh out the characters of the crooks rather than the police... Crockett falls in love with her, blurring the line of duty for him. Foxx also gets his own personal involvement later in the movie, driving the plot's run to the final shoot out where they all need to make the difficult transition from their undercover character's and their real lives as cops.It's well worth a watch - the trademark blue tinged cinematography, big boats, big guns etc. are all there telling you this is a Mann movie - and as long as you expect something a little different, and yes, not as good as usual, you won't be disappointed.",4,"Not thrilling, but intense and realistic",1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,1806,"['have', 'wonder', 'why', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'even', 'bothered', 'call', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'name', 'perfect', 'sense', 'movie', 'yet', 'precious', 'little', 'common', 'TV', 'series', '80', 'Perhaps', 'point', 'made', 'series', 'now', 'how', 'might', 'have', 'looked.So', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'serious', 'intelligent', 'portrayal', 'drugs', 'business', 'Miami', 'ways', 'closer', ""'Traffic"", 'showing', 'mechanics', 'how', 'rather', 'thriller', 'Heat', 'Mann', 'better', 'known', 'Only', 'end', 'do', 'get', 'shoot', 'out', 'full', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'style', 'Farrell', 'Foxx', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'buddy', 'movie', 'are', 'long', 'standing', 'partners', 'who', 'barely', 'need', 'speak', 'know', 'understand', 'other', 'already', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'bonding', 'process', 'Otherwise', 'movie', 'process', 'little', 'characters', 'Instead', 'plot', 'team', 'infiltration', 'large', 'drug', 'running', 'organisation', 'posing', 'boat', 'runners.The', 'only', 'real', 'venture', 'characterisation', 'wonderful', 'Gong', 'Li', 'Cuban', 'Chinese', 'wife', 'main', 'villain', 'not', 'star', 'movie', 'steals', 'many', 'scenes', 'perhaps', 'just', 'Mann', 'nature', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'crooks', 'rather', 'police', 'Crockett', 'love', 'blurring', 'line', 'duty', 'Foxx', 'also', 'own', 'personal', 'involvement', 'later', 'movie', 'driving', 'plot', 'run', 'final', 'shoot', 'where', 'need', 'make', 'difficult', 'transition', 'undercover', 'character', 'real', 'lives', 'cops.It', 'well', 'watch', 'trademark', 'blue', 'tinged', 'cinematography', 'big', 'boats', 'big', 'guns', 'etc', 'are', 'there', 'telling', 'Mann', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'expect', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'yes', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'usual', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

1025298,A3SF2N0BJF0YJS,B000J4QWM2,N. Caine,"[46, 50]","Two things that crack me up in reading reviews of this movie are:  1) when folks point out all the ""unrealistic"" things in the movie, and 2) when folks point out how silly it is that Tubbs and Crocket are so somber and serious.  Among other things, buying this dvd gets you fantastic extras, including two minimovies on the realism (basically, how millions of dollars and months of preproduction were spent copying things exactly), plus a full length commentary by Michael Mann, which is the best commentary I've ever heard for a movie.  You learn that the script was basically written after extensive interviews with undercover DEA agents and professional informants.  Yes, some DEA and FBI stuff gets laid on Crockett and Tubbs (who, technically, are Miami Vice) but for those who think the whole thing is an elaborate fantasy and that only ""The Wire"" tells you how reality works, you should know that almost everything is based on fact down to the tiniest detail.  In fact, one of the reason Crockett and Tubbs are so somber and serious and have so little to say (no donut jokes) is that they spent months shadowing the guys who really do this and they modeled their performances on how these guys really are.  It's a very intense and edgy thing to be undercover, and the guys who are the deepest really are flying planes and making deals in foreign countries all on their own with no backup and with crime syndicates doing extensive background checks on them.The movie will obviously disappoint anyone looking for a conventional narrative.  We don't have an obvious story arc, and the audience is expected to figure out what's going on without lots of repetition.  (For example, the reason they're undercover is because of a leak in the Federal command superstructure, but if you were munching on your popcorn for that line, you're out of luck.)  I saw the movie in the theater and on dvd, and I actually preferred the dvd, because I could catch lines that were inaudible in the theater.  If there's one complaint I have about the film, it's that Gong Li can be very hard to understand.  That said, Mann's commentary taught me that some of the key players in this world are multilingual and aren't necessarily speaking their native language.  Again, something that seems like a Hollywood mistake (""they got an actress who can't pronounce English"") may not be off the mark.What this movie succeeds in doing, beyond any movie I've seen, is to make you feel like you're actually there.  Mann's pioneering work in filming at night, plus his breakthrough work in aerial filming, go to places film has never been before.  In addition, he doesn't use many ""effects.""  When a car is shot up by a canon-rifle, you're watching it really happen.  So you actually feel like you're at a nighttime drug buy, or along the Miami river, or in speedboat, or in Havana.  On a side note, a number of reviewers have mentioned how unrealistic it is that Crocket just drives his boat to Havana.  Listen to Mann's commentary:  that really is Colin Farrell driving that speedboat 70 miles an hour off the tip of Florida, which would take him less than 80 minutes to get to Havana.  Again, it seems like viewers don't want to feel like they're actually there because they think they're being duped.  But it's like they're used to what counts as ""this is real"" from movies.  The same people probably thought ""Traffic"" was realistic, when it was a great example of Hollywood's ""realism"" which is often cliche in itself [hand held cameras, melodramatic acting, tragic figures -- ""oh this is the street!""].A fantastic dvd to buy, which amazing extras, a cinematic experience that feels new every time I watch it, and a compelling film that challenges the audience to do the thinking.P.S.  For those who wonder what ""director's cut"" means, Mann has really only added a few minutes of footage.  To me, it smoothes out the beginning and the end, but you may not even notice.",4,A great movie for those who like a certain rarified reality over cinema conventionality,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,3945,"['Two', 'things', 'crack', 'up', 'reading', 'reviews', 'movie', 'are', '1', 'when', 'folks', 'point', 'out', 'unrealistic', 'things', 'movie', '2', 'when', 'folks', 'point', 'out', 'how', 'silly', 'Tubbs', 'Crocket', 'are', 'so', 'somber', 'serious', 'other', 'things', 'buying', 'dvd', 'fantastic', 'extras', 'including', 'two', 'minimovies', 'realism', 'basically', 'how', 'millions', 'dollars', 'months', 'preproduction', 'were', 'spent', 'copying', 'things', 'exactly', 'full', 'length', 'commentary', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'best', 'commentary', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'movie', 'learn', 'script', 'was', 'basically', 'written', 'extensive', 'interviews', 'undercover', 'DEA', 'agents', 'professional', 'informants', 'Yes', 'DEA', 'FBI', 'stuff', 'laid', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'who', 'technically', 'are', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'who', 'think', 'whole', 'thing', 'elaborate', 'fantasy', 'only', 'Wire', 'how', 'reality', 'should', 'know', 'almost', 'everything', 'based', 'fact', 'tiniest', 'detail', 'fact', 'one', 'reason', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'are', 'so', 'somber', 'serious', 'have', 'so', 'little', 'say', 'donut', 'jokes', 'spent', 'months', 'shadowing', 'guys', 'who', 'really', 'do', 'modeled', 'performances', 'how', 'guys', 'really', 'are', 'very', 'intense', 'edgy', 'thing', 'be', 'undercover', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'deepest', 'really', 'are', 'flying', 'planes', 'making', 'deals', 'foreign', 'countries', 'own', 'backup', 'crime', 'syndicates', 'doing', 'extensive', 'background', 'checks', 'them.The', 'movie', 'will', 'obviously', 'disappoint', 'anyone', 'looking', 'conventional', 'narrative', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'obvious', 'story', 'arc', 'audience', 'expected', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'lots', 'repetition', 'example', 'reason', ""'re"", 'undercover', 'leak', 'Federal', 'command', 'superstructure', 'were', 'munching', 'popcorn', 'line', ""'re"", 'luck', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'dvd', 'actually', 'preferred', 'dvd', 'could', 'catch', 'lines', 'were', 'inaudible', 'theater', 'one', 'complaint', 'have', 'film', 'Gong', 'Li', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'hard', 'understand', 'said', 'Mann', 'commentary', 'taught', 'key', 'players', 'world', 'are', 'multilingual', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'speaking', 'native', 'language', 'Again', 'something', 'Hollywood', 'mistake', 'got', 'actress', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pronounce', 'English', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'off', 'mark.What', 'movie', 'doing', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'actually', 'there', 'Mann', 'pioneering', 'work', 'filming', 'night', 'breakthrough', 'work', 'aerial', 'filming', 'go', 'places', 'film', 'never', 'been', 'before', 'addition', ""n't"", 'use', 'many', 'effects', 'When', 'car', 'shot', 'up', 'canon-rifle', ""'re"", 'watching', 'really', 'happen', 'actually', 'feel', ""'re"", 'nighttime', 'drug', 'buy', 'Miami', 'river', 'speedboat', 'Havana', 'side', 'note', 'number', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'how', 'unrealistic', 'Crocket', 'just', 'boat', 'Havana', 'Listen', 'Mann', 'commentary', 'really', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'driving', 'speedboat', '70', 'miles', 'hour', 'tip', 'Florida', 'would', 'take', 'less', '80', 'minutes', 'get', 'Havana', 'Again', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'feel', ""'re"", 'actually', 'there', 'think', ""'re"", 'being', 'duped', ""'re"", 'used', 'what', 'real', 'movies', 'same', 'people', 'probably', 'thought', 'Traffic', 'was', 'realistic', 'when', 'was', 'great', 'example', 'Hollywood', 'realism', 'often', 'cliche', '[', 'hand', 'held', 'cameras', 'melodramatic', 'acting', 'tragic', 'figures', 'street', ']', '.A', 'fantastic', 'dvd', 'buy', 'amazing', 'extras', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'new', 'time', 'watch', 'compelling', 'film', 'audience', 'do', 'thinking.P.S', 'who', 'wonder', 'what', 'director', 'cut', 'means', 'Mann', 'really', 'only', 'added', 'few', 'minutes', 'footage', 'out', 'beginning', 'end', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'notice']",N/A
1025299,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000J4QWM2,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 5]","Michael Mann's much criticized re-imagining of the hit 80's cop drama Miami Vice features much of what makes Mann a master of the crime drama, and though it is far from perfect, it is nevertheless exciting and exhilirating.  Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell are Tubbs and Crockett respectively, who go on a very dangerous undercover mission to bring down a drug czar and his vast empire.  This is easier said than done, and things don't go as planned as Rico's fellow cop/lover (Naomie Harris) is targeted, and Sonny falls for the business brain (Gong Li) on the opposite side of the law.  As you've no doubt heard by now, Miami Vice the film resembles nothing of the series it is spawned from, and that is quite a good thing here.  Mann orchestrates a cool yet chaotic atmosphere with the escalating tension that anything can happen at any time, something that he's always excelled at doing with classics like Manhunter and Heat, and even his last film Collateral.  The only real downpoints of the film are some of the actors themselves, including Foxx and Farrell who never seem to click together as the rough and rugged partners.  Other cast members, including Ciaran Hinds (HBO's Rome) and Justin Theroux (Mulholland Drive), are pretty much wasted in their limited screen time, but foreign superstar Gong Li is quite good, and her chemistry with Farrell is as well.  There are also bits of goofy logic here and there (I don't think if someone suffered burns do a good percentage of their body, namely their back, and went into a coma that they would be laying on their back in the hospital bed, but that's just me), but this is forgiveable in most cases (except that one).

1025300,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B000J4QWM2,Newton Ooi,"[4, 5]","The original TV series of the same name was a glamorous exploration of Miami, both the legal and illegal side.  This included scenes of the various neighborhoods, interactions with locals of various ethnicities such as Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Haitians, whites, etc..., and run-ins with criminals of various flavors.  Along the way, the show had side stories dealing with local politics, local communities, and local cultures.  This movie ignores all that and focuses solely on the drug world of Miami and Latin America.  In this, it strays much from the original TV show.  The violence here is also quite brutal and ruthless, unlike the stylized violence seen on the TV show.  But there is one thing that stays true to the TV serial; gorgeous women, though for a movie based in a predominantly Hispanic area of the US, the two women leads are Chinese and black.  This director's cut shows both actresses in the nude, something that is a first for both starlets.  The storyline is unoriginal; cops going undercover to bust a drug smuggling ring.  The action is also unoriginal; shootout scenes where the good guys are dead shots and bad guys are blind shots.

You go from undercover stuff, to twenty or so minutes of just some thrown in romance to build attachment to those characters, but fail at it. I mean I really want to like this movie, but it so hard with some idiotic decisions being made towards the end. It's all been done before, and they don't really try and make the story interesting.The story, as I said has all been done before. The same old premise of police going after the drug dealers and the bad guys. I know it's a cop drama, but they don't really bring anything new to it, or any twists. The acting in this movie isn't bad, but that doesn't save them from the mediocre story. Even with good acting, the characters they portray seem to make more stupid decisions as the movie goes on.The setting the movie takes place in is the best part. The beaches are well filmed, and the water looks amazing. I have lived in Florida most of my life, and I feel like they captured it well. Along with the setting, the only good thing this movie does is SOME tactics they use. With those rare scenes, they actually use smarts, and plan out the method of attack.The music in this movie is pretty decent. Some songs play during the fighting and it works well, and makes it entertaining. These moments are rare as well, mainly playing during the parts when they decided to use smart tactics. Gun fire is believable, and the noise of boats racing over the ocean feels like your right next to it. But again sound doesn't make a movie, it is only part of itThe special features are not too bad for this movie. The commentary is more entertaining than the movie itself.

Even though it might be considered corny by today's standards, it was a good show. Miami Vice the movie is not good movie at all. Michael Mann's Heat is one of my favorite flicks of the past and Collateral turned out to be one of 2005's best surprises but here he falls flat. Miami Vice looks good visually but the movie moves at an old man's pace. It never goes beyond the tale of two cops Crockett(Colin Farrell) and Tubbs(Jamie Foxx) who go deep undercover to bust a drug ring. Crockett gets into an uninteresting relationship with Gong Li's character(whose name I forgot) and ends up getting them into trouble with the buyer. YAWN. There is no chemistry between Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell's character and they both look bored out of their skulls. Not only is there no chemistry between Jamie and Colin, there is also no chemistry between Gong Li's character(whose accent makes it hard to understand her) and Colin Farrell's character. They not only have a bland relationship with each other but they have the most boring sex you will ever see on screen. Hell, Morticia and Gomez of the Addams Family have more chemistry than these two. Both Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell deliver their lines in a deep voice that makes them sound as ridiculous as a teenage guy trying to impress a girl by talking in a deep tone plus did I mention that is almost no action in this movie. This movie is billed as an action flick but action rarely happens. Most of the time Miami Vice the movie is a dull drama with limited action sequences. In short if you're a fan of the TV show the movie is named after you wont like this one. At least Miami Vice was exciting.

Really annoying. The storyline of Gong Li (Isabella-the bad guys/girls businesswoman) with whom Colin Farrell (Sonny) got romantically involved, was really corny. The bad guys who supposedly had eyes on everything and everybody, never seemed to have their eyes on the undercover cops when they met their superiors.The climactic gun battle, which you'd expect from a movie like this, is really bogus. The idiotic Vice captain who was fumbling around like an amateur, trying to spot the bad-guy snipers with his night scope should have delegated that duty to HIS snipers (or counter-snipers); who ended up taking out the two bad snipes seconds before the big gun battle. As the gun battle ensued, the Vice cops were doing the majority of the shooting with the bad guys; when the S.W.A.T. assault team should've been there within a few seconds. When S.W.A.T. did show up, the battle was nearly over. And you kind of wonder what the heck happened to the snipers who should've been picking off the bad guys; who were continually exposing themselves to easy shots. But then again, you wouldn't have your exciting, long drawn-out, extended sequence ""shootout"" to thrill the movie-goers.The shootout scene in the trailer was better than the big shootout.

Visually, there's no one better.  And since adopting digital HD as his new medium, the eye candy is made all the more striking.  As a writer, Mann's storylines are typically layered, intricate; the dialogue tight and intelligent.  No one can argue that Heat is one of the coolest, slickest, smartest, most rewarding and dense takes on the ol' cops and robbers formula ever.  Mann's latest film, Miami Vice is a return to that.  The results, however, are underwhelming. While the film looks terrific, the story lost me early on, and for a reason. To conceal the fact that there is no plot.  Thus making a slow movie seem much slower.  The acting, particularly from the leads, is stiff.  They scowl and that's about all.  Brooding aside, there isn't much of a human element here.  Sure, these guys are hard-boiled, street-saavy undercover cops, but there isn't much else for them (or the viewer) to sink their teeth into, to become emotionally invested in.  Miami Vice will surely draw endless comparisons to Heat, and on some levels Miami Vice is like Heat, far moreso than the Mann-created television series of the '80s it's based on, but without the attention to detail or the human element that made that film an instant classic.  It's too bad considering the talent involved.  Miami Vice is ultimately an unsatisfying time.

No over the top fashion statements are seen here either with our two main characters. What we do get is what we have come to expect from Michael Mann. Top notch, ultra stylish film making at it's absolute best. There are several action sequences that are given a refreshing new face lift. You'll find your self feeling like you finally had the chance to see some action worth remembering after years of waiting for it. The big shootout at the end echos the bank Heist shootout in 'Heat', But instead of the loud and dramatic cinematic gun battle we saw in that film, the sound and camera techniques are down played for realism, and it works extremely well. This gun battle looks and sounds almost like something we have all seen in news footage. The hypnotic and fast paced music that has become a Michael Mann signature since his early 80's crime drama- 'Thief' are all here as well and is pitch perfect through out the movie.

There are no more light tunes, flamingos, multi-colored suits, or sunny beaches. The Mann directed version is a gritty yet exaggerated look into the lives of undercover police officers and what they risk. This film focuses on two Miami cops, Crockett ( a surprise turn for Colin Farrell) and Tubbs (a great-as-usual part for Jamie Foxx), who are asked to infiltrate a world-wide drug ring by posing as transporters. As the pair complete more jobs Crockett begins to fall for the head cartel's wife, Isabella(Li Gong). As the relationship continues, the Cartel's partner, Jose Yero, becomes more jealous and untrusting of the undercover duo. He decides to turn the table on their operations and take over the Cartel's business. Yero pressures Tubbs' and Crockett's personal lives until a final duel is inevitable...Because this is a Michael Mann film, loud and realistic shootouts, beautiful cinematography(many different locales including Miami during hurricane season), a diversified score(mellow piano instrumental mixed with hard rock/pop/salsa), and a tight script are inevitable. However, what really drew me to this film was the slow suspenseful build up to the loud climax. Tubbs and Crockket start off well, but their identities slowly are lost in the confusion of multiple duties and personalities. The unrated version adds a few scenes including an opening shot of a boat race during credits, and an emotional fight in a car between Crockett and his love Isabella.

1025314,A1L6V03YBQ8UK0,B000J4QWM2,"Richard Allen ""R. Allen""","[2, 2]","The film itself isn't so bad. I did some reading and research on the making of the movie only to find out that people, for the most part, dislike Michael Mann because of the way he directs a film. He is described as rude and demeaning and will talk down to most of the crew, including the actors. I understand that the movie is his baby and he wants the best for it. It still doesn't excuse his behavior.Apparently, Jamie Foxx was also hard to work with as he was labeled as a crybaby. Turns out throughout shooting, he would refuse to do scenes if they were on boats or on airplanes. He apparently has a fear of these things, but when you sign onto a movie like this, you are told what is going to go down from the start so if you can't hack it, step aside. Foxx also demanded (and got) more money than Colin Farrell or else he wouldn't do the film. He refused to take commercial flights so the studio had to charter a plane for him whenever they changed locations. To top it all off, he demanded he get top billing over Ferrell. Sigh. I think Foxx is a fine actor, but he sure is a diva.Ferrell, for the most part, was apparently a pleasure to work with. Most of the crew said he still liked to joke around here and there, but when it came to getting scenes done, he was very professional and easy going.One thing that shows through the film is that Michael Mann kept doing rewrites. It's not unusual to change a couple of things here and there, but at times Mann would change things the same day so the crew would have to secure things like boats, cars, even reportedly having to close down a highway in a single day because Mann continuously changed his mind. The story in the movie is cohesive, but barely. Even watching the film it feels like as soon as they start getting into a character's development, the pull the rug out from under them. A lot of the dialog sounds contrived and doesn't feel like it was meant to be said. Gong Li had to learn her lines phonetically and it shows from time to time. I really liked her performance though so I can't hate on her too much. She was believable. In the Director's Cut, you get to see more of her character and how she came to be involved in her current circumstances. Her chemistry with Ferrell was good and I am glad they focused on Sonny and Isabella's relationship as much as they did.A lot of people say this movie has no real plot, but it does. The problem is, again, all the changes that Mann implemented as they went along. The plot is weak, but it's there. If you miss even one piece of information, you are likely to get confused so you have to really pay attention.Some of the subtle nuances were nice and added to the movie. One thing Mann definitely got right was making sure we noticed certain things like the weather in the background of several scenes. The sounds of the gunfire was spot on and didn't sound manufactured.As far as the transfer to Blu Ray, I wasn't all that happy with it. I have this movie on DVD as well and I thought it played pretty nice. I got the Blu Ray because I thought the action was good and I wanted to see how they could improve things. The biggest issue I have is that some of the scenes show far too much grain. I don't mind a little grain as it feels more genuine. However, some of the scenes, especially during the night, were so grainy it was difficult to make out objects and, at times, facial expressions. I'm not sure if this is what Mann was going for when he shot those scenes, but it got annoying. The sound is alright, but not perfect. A pet peeve of mine is having to constantly adjust the volume when watching a film. I hate it when dialog is so low I have to crank my television up to 35 just to hear it. I then have to lower it back down to 20 when an action scene comes up because it gets far too loud.3.3 / 5",3,"Not a Bad Film, but a Bad Blu Ray Transfer",1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,3824,"['film', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'did', 'reading', 'research', 'making', 'movie', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'people', 'most', 'part', 'dislike', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'way', 'film', 'described', 'rude', 'demeaning', 'will', 'talk', 'most', 'crew', 'including', 'actors', 'understand', 'movie', 'baby', 'best', 'still', ""n't"", 'excuse', 'behavior.Apparently', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'was', 'also', 'hard', 'work', 'was', 'labeled', 'crybaby', 'out', 'shooting', 'would', 'refuse', 'do', 'scenes', 'were', 'boats', 'airplanes', 'apparently', 'fear', 'things', 'when', 'sign', 'movie', 'are', 'told', 'what', 'going', 'go', 'down', 'start', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hack', 'step', 'aside', 'Foxx', 'also', 'demanded', 'got', 'more', 'money', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'else', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'film', 'refused', 'take', 'commercial', 'flights', 'studio', 'had', 'charter', 'plane', 'whenever', 'changed', 'locations', 'top', 'off', 'demanded', 'get', 'top', 'billing', 'Ferrell', 'Sigh', 'think', 'Foxx', 'fine', 'actor', 'sure', 'diva.Ferrell', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'apparently', 'pleasure', 'work', 'Most', 'crew', 'said', 'still', 'liked', 'joke', 'here', 'there', 'when', 'came', 'getting', 'scenes', 'done', 'was', 'very', 'professional', 'easy', 'going.One', 'thing', 'film', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'kept', 'doing', 'rewrites', 'not', 'unusual', 'change', 'couple', 'things', 'here', 'there', 'times', 'Mann', 'would', 'change', 'things', 'same', 'day', 'crew', 'would', 'have', 'secure', 'things', 'boats', 'cars', 'even', 'reportedly', 'having', 'close', 'down', 'highway', 'single', 'day', 'Mann', 'continuously', 'changed', 'mind', 'story', 'movie', 'cohesive', 'barely', 'Even', 'watching', 'film', 'as', 'soon', 'start', 'getting', 'character', 'development', 'pull', 'rug', 'lot', 'dialog', 'contrived', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'said', 'Gong', 'Li', 'had', 'learn', 'lines', 'phonetically', 'time', 'time', 'really', 'liked', 'performance', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hate', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'believable', 'Director', 'Cut', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'character', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'involved', 'current', 'circumstances', 'chemistry', 'Ferrell', 'was', 'good', 'am', 'glad', 'focused', 'Sonny', 'Isabella', 'relationship', 'as', 'much', 'did.A', 'lot', 'people', 'say', 'movie', 'real', 'plot', 'problem', 'again', 'changes', 'Mann', 'implemented', 'went', 'along', 'plot', 'weak', 'there', 'miss', 'even', 'one', 'piece', 'information', 'are', 'likely', 'get', 'confused', 'so', 'have', 'really', 'pay', 'attention.Some', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'were', 'nice', 'added', 'movie', 'One', 'thing', 'Mann', 'definitely', 'got', 'right', 'was', 'making', 'sure', 'noticed', 'certain', 'things', 'weather', 'background', 'several', 'scenes', 'sounds', 'gunfire', 'was', 'spot', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'manufactured.As', 'far', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'have', 'movie', 'DVD', 'well', 'thought', 'played', 'pretty', 'nice', 'got', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'thought', 'action', 'was', 'good', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'improve', 'things', 'biggest', 'issue', 'have', 'scenes', 'show', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'grain', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'little', 'grain', 'more', 'genuine', 'However', 'scenes', 'especially', 'night', 'were', 'so', 'grainy', 'was', 'difficult', 'make', 'out', 'objects', 'times', 'facial', 'expressions', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Mann', 'was', 'going', 'when', 'shot', 'scenes', 'got', 'annoying', 'sound', 'alright', 'not', 'perfect', 'pet', 'peeve', 'mine', 'having', 'constantly', 'adjust', 'volume', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'hate', 'when', 'dialog', 'so', 'low', 'have', 'crank', 'television', 'up', '35', 'just', 'hear', 'then', 'have', 'lower', 'back', 'down', '20', 'when', 'action', 'scene', 'up', 'far', 'too', 'loud.3.3', '/', '5']",N/A

1025316,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B000J4QWM2,Richard Ross,"[0, 2]","Michael Mann's previous films ""Heat"" and ""Collateral"" are two masterpieces of the crime genre. Knowing his considerable skill at telling a stylish and gritty story in this genre there were a lot of high hopes for ""Miami Vice"". When I initially saw the film in theaters I was pretty disappointed.  Mann's dialogue was kinda embarrassing and amateurish and the other parts of it were what he calls ""shop talk"" between the cops and the crooks. If you aren't as well versed in it as he is you often don't follow because you don't know what's being said. That is one of Manns' gifts as a director is that he knows this world of crime better than anyone which enables him to make these films as realistic as possible. Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) are in a club trying to entrap a pimp when Crockett gets an urgent phone call. It's  from an informant they haven't worked in six months. He sounds terrified and fears for his life and that of his girlfriend. When the boys meet up with him he informs them that a White Supremacist group he was arranging a drug deal with learned who he was working with and he was forced to give  up Crockett and Tubbs. Distraught the man throws himself in front of an oncoming semi. That night after investigating the scene of the crime Crockett and Tubbs get recruited by the Miami P.D.. The local cops want the boys to go undercover for the drug cartel and see the deal through. They also want them to root out the mole who has compromised their identities. This dangerous mission sends the men to exotic locales like the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Paraguay, and eventually Cuba. Their connection is a small time dealer named Yero (John Ortiz in one of the film's best performances ). Crockett and Tubbs pose as smugglers in possession of a super fast boat that is undetectable by radar since it travels low and fast. Yero doesn't trust them but Isabella, his banker,  does. She is played by the beautiful Gong Li and with two lookers like her and Colin Farrell a romance is inevitable. Crockett and Tubbs figure out how low on the chain Yero is and realize that they are going to have do numerous drops until they find the higher up responsible for the murder of their informant. Since Crockett is escorting Isabella to Cuba for the perfect mojito Tubbs is left to arrange the meetings with the dealers. This causes friction between the two partners since everyone but Crockett realizes the danger he is in by sleeping with Yero's woman. With Mann directing and the above mentioned locales the film looks great and he has assembled a capable cast who all give good performances. Foxx does a lot more of the work than Farrell making him a little more like able. Ortiz is a very colorful villain in the ""Scarface"" tradition. Gong Li does a good job of capturing the fear and independence of a woman involved in this line of work. As with most Mann films  the background players are deserving of a lot more screen time. In this case you have the excellent Justin Theroux who is part of Crockett and Tubb's team and the gorgeous and talented Naomie Harris who is Ricardo's girlfriend Trudy. The two have a fair amount of scenes but I wish they could have been written a little better rather than just appearing in the background as support for Crockett and Tubbs. The action scenes are few and far between but when they happen they are easily the best thing going for the film. The last half hour in particular is exactly what made Heat and Collateral masterpieces. You wish that that kind of energy and excitement happened more often rather than coming all at once in the film's final act.",3,Mann what a disappointing effort,1202601600,"02 10, 2008",2008,3650,"['Michael', 'Mann', 'previous', 'films', 'Heat', 'Collateral', 'are', 'two', 'masterpieces', 'crime', 'genre', 'Knowing', 'considerable', 'skill', 'telling', 'stylish', 'gritty', 'story', 'genre', 'were', 'lot', 'high', 'hopes', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'When', 'initially', 'saw', 'film', 'theaters', 'was', 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'Mann', 'dialogue', 'was', 'kinda', 'embarrassing', 'amateurish', 'other', 'parts', 'were', 'what', 'shop', 'talk', 'cops', 'crooks', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'versed', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'one', 'Manns', 'gifts', 'director', 'world', 'crime', 'better', 'anyone', 'make', 'films', 'as', 'realistic', 'possible', 'Sonny', 'Crockett', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Ricardo', 'Tubbs', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'are', 'club', 'trying', 'entrap', 'pimp', 'when', 'Crockett', 'urgent', 'phone', 'call', 'informant', 'have', ""n't"", 'worked', 'six', 'months', 'terrified', 'fears', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'When', 'boys', 'meet', 'up', 'White', 'Supremacist', 'group', 'was', 'arranging', 'drug', 'deal', 'learned', 'who', 'was', 'working', 'was', 'forced', 'give', 'up', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'Distraught', 'man', 'front', 'oncoming', 'semi', 'night', 'investigating', 'scene', 'crime', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'get', 'recruited', 'Miami', 'P.D..', 'local', 'cops', 'want', 'boys', 'go', 'undercover', 'drug', 'cartel', 'see', 'deal', 'also', 'want', 'root', 'out', 'mole', 'who', 'compromised', 'identities', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'men', 'exotic', 'locales', 'Dominican', 'Republic', 'Colombia', 'Paraguay', 'eventually', 'Cuba', 'connection', 'small', 'time', 'dealer', 'named', 'Yero', 'John', 'Ortiz', 'one', 'film', 'best', 'performances', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'pose', 'smugglers', 'possession', 'super', 'fast', 'boat', 'undetectable', 'radar', 'low', 'fast', 'Yero', ""n't"", 'trust', 'Isabella', 'banker', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Gong', 'Li', 'two', 'lookers', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'romance', 'inevitable', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'low', 'chain', 'Yero', 'realize', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'do', 'numerous', 'drops', 'find', 'higher', 'up', 'responsible', 'murder', 'informant', 'Crockett', 'escorting', 'Isabella', 'Cuba', 'perfect', 'mojito', 'Tubbs', 'left', 'arrange', 'meetings', 'dealers', 'friction', 'two', 'partners', 'everyone', 'Crockett', 'danger', 'sleeping', 'Yero', 'woman', 'Mann', 'directing', 'above', 'mentioned', 'film', 'great', 'assembled', 'capable', 'cast', 'who', 'give', 'good', 'performances', 'Foxx', 'lot', 'more', 'work', 'Farrell', 'making', 'little', 'more', 'able', 'Ortiz', 'very', 'colorful', 'villain', 'Scarface', 'tradition', 'Gong', 'Li', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'fear', 'independence', 'woman', 'involved', 'line', 'work', 'most', 'Mann', 'films', 'background', 'players', 'are', 'deserving', 'lot', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'case', 'have', 'excellent', 'Justin', 'Theroux', 'who', 'part', 'Crockett', 'Tubb', 'team', 'gorgeous', 'talented', 'Naomie', 'Harris', 'who', 'Ricardo', 'girlfriend', 'Trudy', 'two', 'have', 'fair', 'amount', 'scenes', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'little', 'better', 'rather', 'just', 'appearing', 'background', 'support', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'when', 'happen', 'are', 'easily', 'best', 'thing', 'going', 'film', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'particular', 'exactly', 'what', 'made', 'Heat', 'Collateral', 'masterpieces', 'wish', 'kind', 'energy', 'excitement', 'happened', 'more', 'often', 'rather', 'coming', 'once', 'film', 'final', 'act']",N/A
1025317,AO6L5RJILSLDX,B000J4QWM2,"R. Long ""Tessie's Boy""","[3, 4]","I don't hold any slavish devotion to the original ""Miami Vice"" series. I watched it as a kid with my parents in the '80s and I enjoyed it for what it was: a cool and colorful cop show, no more, no less. So I guess I was the perfect audience for this new version, in that I was aware of the older version without being entrenched in it (i.e., I wasn't going to start a petition if Colin Farrell wasn't wearing rolled-up sleeves, pastels and sockless loafers). I thought the movie was good, if not as great as it could have been. Jamie Foxx brings some surprising intensity in the role of Tubbs (even getting to imitate his former co-star Tom Cruise's moves from ""Collateral"" in an early club scene); Farrell was adequate, if a little wooden, as Crockett. They didn't have the chemistry that Don Johnson and Phillip Michael Thomas had, which is underscored by the fact that Foxx and Farrell don't have many one-on-one scenes together. (Also, it was hard to keep from snickering at Crockett's goofy-looking mustache.) At the very least, ""Miami Vice"" goes well beyond the usual lazy, nostalgia-laden updated of most films based on old TV shows, and Michael Mann still has a unique eye for realistic action sequences that would baffle any other director.Leaving aside my thoughts on the film itself, this Blu-Ray is visually and aurally stunning. Furthermore, it perfectly represents the director's intent. Some people have said that this Blu-Ray release is subpar or lacking compared to the DVD. These people are wrong. For those complaining about excessive grain: the night scenes are always going to be grainy, because Mann shot most of the night scenes on HD video with low and/or natural light. The daylight scenes are razor-sharp. Again, I cannot stress this enough: Mann MEANT the film to look like this. You may not like the technique, but it's not the fault of Universal or whatever company that authored the Blu-Ray. If you're saying that you'd actually prefer to have digital noise reduction applied where it wasn't meant to be applied (and counter to the director's intent) then I don't know what to say to that one.Take it from someone who saw the movie in the theater, on DVD and on Blu-Ray: on home video, this is the way to watch Miami Vice.",4,Counterpoint,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,2252,"['do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'slavish', 'devotion', 'original', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'series', 'watched', 'kid', 'parents', ""'80s"", 'enjoyed', 'what', 'was', 'cool', 'colorful', 'cop', 'show', 'more', 'less', 'guess', 'was', 'perfect', 'audience', 'new', 'version', 'was', 'aware', 'older', 'version', 'being', 'entrenched', 'i.e.', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'start', 'petition', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'was', ""n't"", 'wearing', 'rolled-up', 'sleeves', 'pastels', 'sockless', 'loafers', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'surprising', 'intensity', 'role', 'Tubbs', 'even', 'getting', 'imitate', 'former', 'co-star', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'moves', 'Collateral', 'early', 'club', 'scene', 'Farrell', 'was', 'adequate', 'little', 'wooden', 'Crockett', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'chemistry', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'Phillip', 'Michael', 'Thomas', 'had', 'underscored', 'fact', 'Foxx', 'Farrell', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'one-on-one', 'scenes', 'together', 'Also', 'was', 'hard', 'keep', 'snickering', 'Crockett', 'goofy-looking', 'mustache', 'very', 'least', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'well', 'usual', 'lazy', 'nostalgia-laden', 'updated', 'most', 'films', 'based', 'old', 'TV', 'shows', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'still', 'unique', 'eye', 'realistic', 'action', 'sequences', 'would', 'baffle', 'other', 'director.Leaving', 'thoughts', 'film', 'Blu-Ray', 'visually', 'aurally', 'stunning', 'Furthermore', 'perfectly', 'director', 'intent', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'subpar', 'lacking', 'compared', 'DVD', 'people', 'are', 'wrong', 'complaining', 'about', 'excessive', 'grain', 'night', 'scenes', 'are', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'grainy', 'Mann', 'shot', 'most', 'night', 'scenes', 'HD', 'video', 'low', 'and/or', 'natural', 'light', 'daylight', 'scenes', 'are', 'razor-sharp', 'Again', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'enough', 'Mann', 'MEANT', 'film', 'look', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'technique', 'not', 'fault', 'Universal', 'company', 'authored', 'Blu-Ray', ""'re"", 'saying', ""'d"", 'actually', 'prefer', 'have', 'digital', 'noise', 'reduction', 'applied', 'where', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'applied', 'counter', 'director', 'intent', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', 'one.Take', 'someone', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'home', 'video', 'way', 'watch', 'Miami', 'Vice']",N/A
1025318,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000J4QWM2,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 4]","Miami Vice (Michael Mann, 2006)The opening scene in Miami Vice makes it clear, in at least one respect, how Michael Mann and his team have changed over the years. The music in the original TV series Miami Vice was one of the best things about it; Jan Hammer's adrenaline-fueled electropop was bolstered by tracks from such artists as Phil Collins, Glenn Frey, Jackson Browne, Steve Jones, and Bryan Ferry--music that was both rooted in the past and, at least where the eighties were concerned, was well-integrated into the present. Now comes Michael Mann's ""updated"" film version (in which ""updated"" equates to, for example, Colin Farrell's hair being even worse than Don Johnson's was twenty years previous), whose opening scene's music is awful in the extreme, turning a five-minute scene into an endless loop of aural torture best viewed on fast-forward. (Any plot points you miss will be reiterated later, don't worry.) The rest of it's not much better, with a focus on simple, repetitious lyrics and the kind of mindless four-on-the-floor electronica that's here today, gone tomorrow.The more mechanical applications of the update have lost less depth, but their faithfulness does turn the movie into not much more than a feature-length episode of the television show upon which the movie is based. Crockett (Farrell) and Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) go undercover in the organization of a drug lord. Crockett battles with his ethics and gets involved with a beautiful enemy (Gong Li). Tubbs is his anchor to reality.

Martel""","[3, 3]","Instead of making a Miami Vice parody movie, or simply revisiting the television era with younger actors and a fresh plot, director Michael Mann takes the basics of Miami Vice and plants it firmly in 2006.  Here Crockett and Tubbs are tough, no nonsense cops who's lives are on the line.  Here the stakes are high, the villains are cunning, and the payoff is intense.First things first, this is not an action film.  It's not trying to be one.  Instead it's a crime drama, delving into the worlds of cops (and a bit of the criminals) in the Miami area.  Instead of creating a series of climaxes (as he did in ""Heat"") this movie is closer to ""Collateral"".  It builds and builds with sparks flying here and there until the whole thing erupts in an excellent fire fight.The script is tight, and moves a brisk pace.  Viewers need to pay attention and have an ear for accents (there are several floating around during the movie and I found it helpful to have the close captions on).  Direction is typical Michael Mann; everything has an elegant coolness to it.  Miami looks awesome in many of the shots of the film.  The movie is visually dark with lots of blue hues in it, giving it a definate visual style.Sound effects were very good.  I especially liked the gun battle at the end of the film.  The weapons sounded realistic (not Hollywood).  I also enjoyed the score and music used in the film (fans of the television will be disappointed in the lack of 80's nostalgia).The only weak points were casting.  Jamie Foxx and Naomie Harris were excellent and I found their relationship to be interesting and handled very well.  On the flip side I found Colin Farrell adequate at best and bland at worst.  He didn't seem to carry the part off as well as he could have.  In addition Gong Li, a beautiful woman and superb actress, was lacking something.  I'm not sure if her chemistry with Farrell was to blame, or if working in English was difficult, but she is great in certain scenes and in others she didn't click for me.All told, I enjoyed the film.  I wished it had been a bit better (and I think different casting would have solved my main problems), but as part of Michael Mann's delving into the world of crime and cops, this is a solid entry.",4,Fans of the television series beware.

1025322,ADKA2MJQQCMTO,B000J4QWM2,Ron Sullivan,"[2, 4]","I'll state up front that I'm a huge Michael Mann fan and I'm being as generous as I can when I label this as being ""Fair.""  The truth is that it's an uncharacteristically sloppy effort from the vastly talented cast and crew (Mann in particular).As for the bright spots, Jamie Foxx makes another solid outing.  Foxx is quickly gaining a great deal of my attention.  He's done ('Stealth' aside) a couple of genuinely terrific films in a pretty short period of time.  The film's action sequences are also at the same high-level that I've come to expect from any Mann film.As for the bad, unfortunately, the writing and the directing are both sub-par and that falls squarely on Mann's shoulders.  Right from the opening twenty minutes of the 'Director's Cut' and it's inflated and pointless boat race through to the end of the club scene where we meet-up with Crockett and Tubbs getting ready to take down a prostitution ring.  Then a cell phone rings and we learn that a different operation is going wrong.  I looked down at my watch to realize that close to a half an hour had gone by and absolutely nothing relevant to the film had even happened yet because the entire movie up to this point has just been dropped for a totally different story-arc.  This whole un-sequence leads into what I thought was the story.We're told that there's an information leak that caused the death of two under-cover agents.  Farrell and Foxx are then asked to help ferret-out the security-breach since they're unknown to anyone else in the operation.  However, this ""mole-in-the-department"" is never explored any further.  Isn't anyone concerned that,pretty clearly, someone inside is selling out their people?  Not to mention that for all their trouble they never actually arrest the character 'Montoya' (the film's primary villian) which leaves the film's ending feeling hurried and half-finished.  Plot-lines seem to just be dropped or conjured-up all over the place for no apparent reason.Outside of Foxx, the acting seems to be fair to below average.  As odd as this is going to sound Colin Farrell seems to be trying too hard to seem gritty and noir-ish.  Li Gong, in my opinion, is miscast as Crockett's love-interest.  Not only do I think they cast an actress with the wrong nationality, but her actress's accent is so thick, it makes her difficult to understand.  Mann would have been better served with someone like Penelope Cruz.  Granted, the ""brooding cop"" archetype has been done to death, but there's no real character development anywhere in the movie.  The reason it's necessary is because when we see Crockett fall for Gong's character, it comes off not feeling genuine and you don't buy into it.  It undermines one of the only working plots the film has going for it two-thirds in.I'd recommend this for fans of Mann only.  This is a work that seems to want very badly to be both 'Heat' and 'Collateral' at exactly the same time and (unfortunately) fails in both attempts.",2,Fair ...,1184025600,"07 10, 2007",2007,2972,"[""'ll"", 'state', 'up', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'fan', ""'m"", 'being', 'as', 'generous', 'can', 'when', 'label', 'being', 'Fair', 'truth', 'uncharacteristically', 'sloppy', 'effort', 'vastly', 'talented', 'cast', 'crew', 'Mann', 'particular', '.As', 'bright', 'spots', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'solid', 'outing', 'Foxx', 'quickly', 'gaining', 'great', 'deal', 'attention', 'done', 'aside', 'couple', 'genuinely', 'terrific', 'films', 'pretty', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'film', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'also', 'same', 'high-level', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Mann', 'film.As', 'bad', 'unfortunately', 'writing', 'directing', 'are', 'sub-par', 'squarely', 'Mann', 'shoulders', 'Right', 'opening', 'twenty', 'minutes', ""'Director"", 'Cut', 'inflated', 'pointless', 'boat', 'race', 'end', 'club', 'scene', 'where', 'meet-up', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'getting', 'ready', 'take', 'down', 'prostitution', 'ring', 'Then', 'cell', 'phone', 'rings', 'learn', 'different', 'operation', 'going', 'wrong', 'looked', 'down', 'watch', 'realize', 'close', 'hour', 'had', 'gone', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'relevant', 'film', 'had', 'even', 'happened', 'yet', 'entire', 'movie', 'up', 'point', 'just', 'been', 'dropped', 'totally', 'different', 'story-arc', 'whole', 'un-sequence', 'leads', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'story.We', ""'re"", 'told', 'information', 'leak', 'caused', 'death', 'two', 'under-cover', 'agents', 'Farrell', 'Foxx', 'are', 'then', 'asked', 'help', 'ferret-out', 'security-breach', ""'re"", 'unknown', 'anyone', 'else', 'operation', 'However', 'mole-in-the-department', 'never', 'explored', 'further', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'concerned', 'pretty', 'clearly', 'someone', 'inside', 'selling', 'out', 'people', 'Not', 'mention', 'trouble', 'never', 'actually', 'arrest', 'character', 'film', 'primary', 'villian', 'film', 'ending', 'feeling', 'hurried', 'half-finished', 'Plot-lines', 'seem', 'just', 'be', 'dropped', 'conjured-up', 'place', 'apparent', 'reason.Outside', 'Foxx', 'acting', 'be', 'fair', 'below', 'average', 'As', 'odd', 'going', 'sound', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'be', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'seem', 'gritty', 'noir-ish', 'Li', 'Gong', 'opinion', 'miscast', 'Crockett', 'love-interest', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'think', 'cast', 'actress', 'wrong', 'nationality', 'actress', 'accent', 'so', 'thick', 'difficult', 'understand', 'Mann', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'someone', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Granted', 'brooding', 'cop', 'archetype', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'anywhere', 'movie', 'reason', 'necessary', 'when', 'see', 'Crockett', 'fall', 'Gong', 'character', 'not', 'feeling', 'genuine', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'one', 'only', 'working', 'plots', 'film', 'going', 'two-thirds', 'in.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'fans', 'Mann', 'only', 'work', 'want', 'very', 'badly', 'be', ""'Heat"", ""'Collateral"", 'exactly', 'same', 'time', 'unfortunately', 'attempts']",N/A

1025324,A2CDZZQVYJENOQ,B000J4QWM2,"Royster ""Royster""","[3, 6]","My two cents on MVAfter watching Mann's Miami Vice and subsequently reading several polarising reviews, I was reminded of bands like The Fall and Yo La Tengo, or albums such as ""Trout Mask Replica"" and ""Bitches Brew"", the thing they have in common is - either you get them or you don't.Unlike most filmmakers who works in crime drama, Mann's interests lie not in overt emotions (Scorcese, Woo, Coppola), bombast (Scott brothers, Michael Bay, Donner), schematics (Hitchcock, De Palma, Fincher) or didactic/polemic (Spike Lee, Tarantino, Oliver Stone) but in mood and psychology. His lineage is that of John Ford, Kurosawa, Leone and Anthony Mann, along with contemporaries such as Cronenberg, Mamet, Chris Nolan as well as a few non-genre world cinema directors, such as Wenders, Wong Kar Wai and Johnnie To.In Mann's hyper-realistic worlds, characters are defined by the careers. Like their creator, they are artisans, consummate professionals and borderline obsessives. They rarely let each other, let alone the viewer, into their world and motivations. The viewer is left to observe them at work, and the detail is God environment they inhabit. As UK critic Nick James noted in his essay on ""Heat."" In Mann's films, the Style IS the substance. From the negative reviews, this doesn't sit well with critics weaned either on Sundance humanist aesthetic or more traditionalist/literary-bias where story is king. It almost like listening to a Steve Reich movement or a percussion piece and complaining that they couldn't get the melody when it's the rhythm that they should be appreciating in the first place. I am interested in seeing whether reviews from other parts of the world, say Japan and parts of Europe - where a monastic ""work ethic"" is still widely practiced and held in high esteem by their culture - would see things differently.As most critics and viewers realised by now, Vice 06 is not Miami Vice at all, save for the character's names and Nonpoint's cover of ""in the air tonight"". What they hadn't pointed out is that it is actually an expanded and retooled hybrid of 2 stories in Mann's 2002 series ""Robbery Homicide Division"" which starred Tom Sizemore and Barry Shabaka Henley. The 2 episodes in question are episode 8 ""Wild Ride"" and episode 9 ""Life is Dust"". In ""Wild Ride"" - in which Tom Towles (Coleman in Vice) played a White Supremacist drug dealer on a crime spree which culminated in a crackdown in a trailer park which ended in a thug blowing up a trailer/meth lab. Then ""Life is Dust"" - based on a ""story by Michael Mann"" but directed by Mario Van Peebles, had Sizemore going undercover to track down a Vietnamese arms dealer, fell for his Vietnamese lawyer wife and ended in a gunfight at a sting gone wrong. As the two synopsis illustrated, the episodes served as the ""LA Takedown*"" to Vice 06. Whole snatches of dialogue and scenes were reshaped and refined for this film.In fact, the interpersonal dynamics and characterisations of Vice 06 drew more from the Sizemore/Henley and co, than 80s Vice. Like many relationships in workplaces and unlike most cliched ""buddy movie"" pair ups, there are those which you hung with and there are those who you could rely on to get the job done, and 90% of the time they are not the same person. Like RHD, in Vice 06 C/T appeared to be working partners rather than friends.On the dvd commentary of ""Collateral"" Mann mentioned that he is interested in developing that film as ""a third act"" of something larger. I feel that this tactic was quite subtle there, as there were plenty of exposition - both visual and aural, to establish the story. In Vice on the hand, this structure was made explicit, the viewer is literally dropped, mid-scene, into Vice's world, almost like ""finding"" a show whilst channel surfing. Mann's conscious and deadpan homage to tv viewing? Maybe. Mann then propelled you into their mission in a ""fly on the wall"" manner. What happened over the next 2 hours was the cinematic equivalent of ECM album covers, Asian minimalist art, or a pared down sports car - form and function becoming one.The film itself was all about deceit, from playful lies of Tubb's love scene, Crocket/Isabella's relationship, to Crockett/Tubbs persona and posturing, towards both the dealers and to the FBI. The surface sheen of the jargon, big boats, big guns and fast cars are also part of the lies/facade. Truth and character were gleaned through work and action - trademarks of Mann's pop existentialism. For those who didn't catch RHD, a natural non-Mann companion to Vice is Mamet's Spartan. Like Mann, Mamet is another artist who revel in dealing with machismo and professionals (Glengary Glen-Ross, Homicide, Heist, House of Cards and more recently, the Heat/Mann-like tv series, The Unit) yet Mamet's worlds had two things which made them more ""mainstream"" and ""populist"" than Mann - his ""gift of gab"" (quotable lines) and schematics (plot twists). One can only imagine what might happen if their worlds collide!Like a pre-Michael Moore documentarian, Mann captured this ""Mann-made"" world and all its lies for the viewer to experience, the editoralising is done not through conventional dialogue but through purely cinematic/technical means. Visually, what is most uniquely Mann is that, despite his affinity to the handheld aesthetic - often seen in cinema verite, documentaries, reality and procedural shows like Homicide, NYPD Blue, Cops or the Shield - the results, to this viewer at least, were always perfectly composed and considered as opposed to frenetic. Its usage stemmed not from the desire simulate kineticism but rather to visually illustrate the interior of the characters, this was true in Heat, The Insider**, Ali and by and large in Vice. The same applies to the soundtrack which serves to underscore the emotions, and songs were used to define the time and place.Atmospherically, the word foreboding comes to mind, like Heat and RHD the smothering sense of dread were all consuming. Mann and his cinematographer's complete mastery of HD (not to mimic film but as a new medium) serve to instill the ambience with heat and texture. Violence is portrayed swiftly, realistically and had deadly or traumatising effects, in this respect, it reminded me of Cronenberg's ""History of Violence"".So, on the surface at least, this makes for a ultimate Mann film, and while it is true in some ways (visual realisation, mise en scene often rivals The Insider and Heat), there were severe lapses of judgment that for me, made it a ""flawed"" piece. A few minor ones could be deemed ""fixable"" in the eventual dvd release (Nonpoint's appalling cover, relooping of some of Gong's dialogue, awkward timing on a few transitions), all but one of these flaws have to do with the four major ""unfixable"" flaws - the film's name, Colin Farrell, Jamie Foxx and Gong Li.I cannot say that the actors lack acting chops, rather, I feel that they were let down by their relative ""newness"". What made Heat so remarkable and affecting, even to non-Mann admirers - despite the similar lack of overt backstories - was the audiences' collective memory of DeNiro and Pacino's past works. Their twenty-odd year or so of baggage that helped to inform the audience subconsciously of who the characters were. Neither Farrell nor Foxx had the history or gravitas for viewers to latch onto, thereby the viewers were forced to see them as extensions of the persona created by Johnson and Thomas. Had the film went for a different title or had Mann chosen either more established actors or complete unknowns the result might be altogether more positive. Then there's Li, who, besides her difficulty in mastering English (a big problem in the US, but definitely less in the rest of the world), seemed miscast and was unable to fully convey the harsh yet tender aspect of her character. I couldn't help but imagine what someone like Maggie Cheung might bring to the role.As someone who admired most of Mann's output, (in fact my least favourite were his more ""traditional"" work like ""The Last of theMohicians"" and the 80s Miami Vice), I find this cinematic version of ""Robbery Homicide Division - Miami Vice"" to be an engrossing cinematic experience, and his output has been underappreciated by both the mainstream, critics and film scholars alike.* ""LA Takedown"" was Mann's little seen tv movie from which Heat was derived from.**Compare Mann's Insider to Stone's JFK, Nixon or even the earlier works of Alan J Pakula, and you'll begin to respect Mann's masterful riff on paranoia films, transforming a ""ripped from the headlines"" docu-thriller into an intense character study, by subverting the visual/aesthetic cues of a Stonesian conspiracy thriller.",4,"Robbery Homicide Division Redux, not Miami Vice 2006.",1154563200,"08 3, 2006",2006,8701,"['two',

Both Heat and Collateral provided stellar performances, proper gun handling and technique and decent screenplays.Miami Vice the movie was a complete disaster.  The acting was stiff, almost like cartoon characters.  Granted, the movie didn't have masters like De Niro or Pacino, but I expected a lot more from Foxx and Farrell.  The supporting cast was even worse.  And what's up with the screenplay?  There's this scene where one of the female cops threatens an informant with throwing him out a window.  Talk about idiotic empty threats.  In Heat, while interrogating Ashley Judd's boyfriend, the cops intelligently interrogates the subject by leveraging him with the threat of extradition to another state where he would be automatically sent back to prison on a parole violation if he didn't cooperate.  Now that's a threat with a brain behind it.  And then you have the .50 cal sniper rifles.  My impression that it was gross over kill and sensationalist like the typical Hollywood use of Desert Eagle hanguns.  M14s would have made more sense given the possibility of having to be utilized for both sniper and up close work.  And I'm sorry, but Gong Li looked terrible.  I really like Asian women, but she looked like she got up without putting on any makeup and didn't get enough sleep.When I watch a Michael Mann film, I expect to see a modern day classic.  I expect realism intended for a thinking audience.  If I want to watch the typical Hollywood tripe, then I can just go to the theater and watch whatever is playing at the multiplex.The old Miami Vice series had better acting, better gun handling (Don Johnson's Weaver stance), better story lines and much better character development.",1,Dissapointed Michael Mann Fan,1174003200,"03 16, 2007",2007,1729,"['love', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'films', 'Heat', 'Collateral', 'provided', 'stellar', 'performances', 'proper', 'gun', 'handling', 'technique', 'decent', 'screenplays.Miami', 'Vice', 'movie', 'was', 'complete', 'disaster', 'acting', 'was', 'stiff', 'almost', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'Granted', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'masters', 'De', 'Niro', 'Pacino', 'expected', 'lot', 'more', 'Foxx', 'Farrell', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'what', 'up', 'screenplay', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'female', 'cops', 'informant', 'throwing', 'out', 'window', 'Talk', 'idiotic', 'empty', 'threats', 'Heat', 'interrogating', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'boyfriend', 'cops', 'intelligently', 'subject', 'leveraging', 'threat', 'extradition', 'state', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'automatically', 'sent', 'back', 'prison', 'parole', 'violation', 'did', ""n't"", 'cooperate', 'Now', 'threat', 'brain', 'then', 'have', '.50', 'cal', 'sniper', 'rifles', 'impression', 'was', 'gross', 'kill', 'sensationalist', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'use', 'Desert', 'Eagle', 'hanguns', 'M14s', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'given', 'possibility', 'having', 'be', 'utilized', 'sniper', 'up', 'close', 'work', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Gong', 'Li', 'looked', 'terrible', 'really', 'Asian', 'women', 'looked', 'got', 'up', 'putting', 'makeup', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'sleep.When', 'watch', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'film', 'expect', 'see', 'modern', 'day', 'classic', 'expect', 'realism', 'intended', 'thinking', 'audience', 'want', 'watch', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'tripe', 'then', 'can', 'just', 'go', 'theater', 'watch', 'whatever', 'playing', 'multiplex.The', 'old', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'series', 'had', 'better', 'acting', 'better', 'gun', 'handling', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'Weaver', 'stance', 'better', 'story', 'lines', 'much', 'better', 'character', 'development']",N/A
1025327,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000J4QWM2,Samuel McKewon,"[2, 3]","In Michael Mann's ""Miami Vice,"" the tropical skies flash with lightning, but never burst with rain.  Why is that? The answer lies in the sensitive high definition camera technology - nicknamed the Viper - Mann and cinematographer Dion Beebe use to film the movie. What the Viper does - turning night backgrounds into Monet prints complete with purple/grey skies - and does not yet do - film well on the run, in the rain, in the supreme heat, for very long takes - is half of why ""Miami Vice"" becomes what it is: A series of artistic stills, one after another, injecting a kind of mesmerizing unease that you get after swimming in the sun too long or rousing from sleep fueled by cough dope - but it never really progresses into the kind of kinetics that its milieu - Drugs! Sex! Fast Stuff! - suggest. It simmers and froths and then just stretches on into the heavens - pointlessly, for in the end it's just some macho cop flick that, if it does its job, ought to buzz you. Not drill the kind of somnambulant tone you'd hear in a Japanese elevator into your head.And when the movie reaches this stasis 30 minutes in, after the story's been set, a joke's been told and you're attuned to the fuzzy-yet-pungent color scheme of the Viper, nothing in the production breaks free of it. Not the performances from Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx as Sonny Crockett and Rico Tubbs. Not the tepid villains. Not the sex scenes. And certainly not Mann's script, his worst, which has no payoff and trades in a kind of nonsense cop code that uses the phrase ""fabricated fundamentals"" to describe ""fake identities."" Everybody talks in smug, ridiculous platitudes with words like ""OPSEC,"" ""AWAC,"" ""skillsets"" and ""go-fast boats."" That means, you know, speedboats. It is hard, considering they act like bemused aliens in civilian clothes, to much like or believe them.""Miami Vice"" opens in a club where the Crockett and Tubbs lead a team - Mann wordlessly introduces them - to bust, one would guess, a prostitution ring (although that too must be insinuated) when Crockett receives a call from an informant about a drug sting operation about to go bad. It eventually leads to an FBI chief (Ciaran Hinds) deputizing the team to find the leak that tipped off the white-supremacist suppliers. That means masquerading as a transport team for the Columbian drug lord Arcangel Jesus de Montoya (Luis Tosar), who is fronted by Cuban-American lawyer Isabella (Gong Li) and henchman Jose Yero (John Ortiz). Yero's a sporty, manic creep whose teeth would drip with food spit if Mann ordained it. Isabella is a total fiction - borderline incoherent in both Spanish and English - created so Mann could help foreign box office with a Chinese movie star.Crockett and Isabella fall quickly and deeply in love for reasons unexplained -considering that Gong Li is difficult to understand half the time, it can't be the witty banter - while Tubbs is essentially separated from his cop girlfriend (Naomie Harris) until she's kidnapped later in the picture. The plot lurches toward a static shootout in a boatyard that essentially consists of Mann stationing a camera behind an actor shooting his semiautomatic machine gun at an indiscernible enemy. At its end we cast our eyes back at what started this plot in motion - a leak - are unable, as far as I could tell, to decide who, if anyone, that was. A small hope for this picture was that it would shame Michael Bay's ""Bad Boys"" pictures with its artistic expertise and capture of cool. While ""Miami Vice"" is not the vile thing those pictures are, it does not deliver.The acting choices that Foxx and Farrell, two excellent, demonstrative performers, make here are a shock: They're dull, flat and terse. Mann must've shot Farrell, who has a not a little Mel Gibson in him, with horse tranquilizers. Mann needs great stars who know, to quote the movie, their skillsets - Daniel Day Lewis, Russell Crowe, Tom Cruise and Al Pacino  -  to drown the director's urge to stand quietly apart from it all and dispassionately observe. He sunk the uninspiring ""Ali"" with that drive, and though this movie is much lovelier to look at, he sinks it too.Mann shoots all over the Western Hemisphere - Uruguay, the Dominican Republic, the spectacular waterfalls of the Amazon - but, aside from the admittedly jaw-dropping helicopter shots, he doesn't use the locales to any great effect and in fact spends what must have been millions of dollars to simply prove he ""went"" there, indulging in a kind of idiotic hubris that once sunk the great 1970s directors. In an era where dollars genuinely count, it begins to make sense to ask: To what did the x amount of money used to create this creature go? ""Miami Vice"" cost $125 million to make. Any single entry in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy costs less. Does that tell you something?And, my goodness, he wants to make a sequel.",3,Flat. Dull. Gorgeous. Flat. Dull. Gorgeous. Flat.

From the get go this film is cool and stylish, and it has all the ambience of Miami with the fast cars, Ferrari, Bentley GT, BMW 8 Series, fast boats, private jets, water, and attitude. I was surprised to see that the film stood its own and probably only used the ""Miami Vice"" title for marketing purposes. Sure, the TV Miami Vice characters are there by name, but this movie could have lived without the comparisons, and in fact I was trying hard to find reminders of Miami Vice the TV show, but I really couldn't find any and I thoroughly enjoyed this film.At first viewing I was hoping that the music would be better, but after I bought the soundtrack and listened to it several times as well as watching the DVD several times, the music is actually an exceptional selection. Also at first viewing I thought that the acting wasn't that good overall and that the script had some problems, but after watching the film now several times there are many gems in this film, also in the acting with standouts by John Ortiz who does an excellent job as Jose Yero, and then as brief as his role was, but Luis Tosar as the drug kingpin named Montoya produces a very convincing character with great acting.I really enjoyed this film and I have now watched it several times on DVD. Everything is done so well with the location choices and the many details, and the photography was excellent, and overall it was a very good story about the drug trade and in a sense it reminded me remotely of Pacino's Scarface two decades ago - of course Miami Vice is a different flick and as it's growing on me with repeated viewing it's becoming one of my all-time favorite films.I'm not a Colin Farrell fan, but he did a very good job in this film. Also Li Gong added to the substance of the movie and plays a unique character as Isabella who appears cool and distant on the surface, but portraying much passion and sensitivity on the inside - great acting.Does this movie deserve an ""R"" rating? Maybe, because of some sensual scenes and the occasional and unnecessary use of the F word, but compared to other flicks with a PG-13 rating I would say in today's age a PG-13 would have been more appropriate.One thing that I rarely do, I've watched this movie now several times on the big screen and the DVD is a definite buy and belongs in every DVD collection -- get the Unrated Director's cut -- it's excellent and it's a cool flick. Director Michael Mann pays attention to all the details, ... the sky, the mood and ambience, the cars, boats and airplanes, etc., the style, the soundtrack which is also a must as you get selected songs by Moby, India Arie and Manzanita, etc.I think most movie fans will begin to appreciate this film in years to come as a unique cinematic experience. This movie deserves almost 5 stars, ... really it's that good considering all the details, but you will have to watch it a few times to appreciate the many details and to discover the hidden gems.",4,Cool and Stylish!

Here in Miami Vice, we have the perfect example of how bad a movie can possibly be. I am still in denial that this movie is directed by Michael Mann...it just doesn't fit in my head.Like Collateral, Mann takes the same camerawork approach he used, which consists of a documentary ""real"" style. Now unlike Collateral, this movie makes barely any sense. In Collateral we had a plot that was quite plausible and entertaining, and the ""real' style worked, it gave an edge to the movie. But here in Miami Vice...it's just...pathetic; nothing stands in this film, everything is confusing and muddled. Every line is represented as a complex situation...there is not one line where we actually care or feel for the characters.From what I understood, the plot tries to bring the dangerous world of narcotics...ok that could be interesting...NOW ALL WE NEDD IS FOR IT TO MAKE SENSE!!! Seriously how hard can that be, I literally wanted to destroy this DVD after sitting 140 min in front of the screen. Also there is no action, just one real action scene at the end that feels boring...even the action was boring. I'm still pondering on how the hell this movie cost 135 million...its absurd, I cant comprehend how a piece of manure like this can cost so much and have the look of it been shot by an amateur...either Mann didn't care for this movie, or he was high.Not to mention that the film has the most scenes of the characters using their cell phones. Every freaking 5 min we see Collin Farrell and Jaime Fox holding a cell and trying to look cool with their shades. It as if they were placing this movie in a nice package to make it look good. Let me tell you something, no matter how much you shine crap, it will still be crap; and why in the world did Mann copy the same scene of Collateral with the night club...I mean it looked cool in that film, but here it fells bland and soulless. This movie has nothing positive to its side, perhaps some well shot scenes, but that doesn't save the film from irrelevant sex scenes, confusing plot, bad dialogue, and crappy action sequences.

When the movie came out, I knew I'd be dragged to the show to see it, and indeed I was.  But I was in for a surprise because I definitely enjoyed it.  The first thing that stood out to me was the diverse cast.  Hollywood has a way of snubbing minority actors/actresses in films, but this one was full of everybody--Asian, Cuban, Black, White, etc. as major stars in the movie.  Each actor played his/her part to a tea, and I was equally interested in the mysterious drug deal, relationship, friendship, and philosophy of the FBI.  The action scenes were believable instead of over-the-top; the dialogue was realistic; and the plot moved at a steady pace.  After watching this movie, I'm going to go ahead and give in to watching some of my mother's old tapes of the show.  I may have missed something good.The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because sometimes the conversations between the cops was full of so much coding that I lost focus of the movie. I found myself paying more attention to the characters and less to the plot.  I also was rather curious as to why the two main cops seemed to be working alone when they were partners.  They were barely together, and when they were, they were doing their own thing.  I wondered ""Are they really this antisocial on the show?""

See Michael Mann's film adaptation of The Keep (1983).Wanna read an excellent Thriller? Read Thomas Harris' Red Dragon (1981). Wanna see an example of how a book can be made into a movie that's relatively true to the novel? See Michael Mann's film adaptation of Red Dragon called Manhunter (1986) [not to be confused with 2002's Red Dragon remake of Manhunter].Wanna see a campy, Michael Mann produced, popular TV series from the 80s? Rent seasons 1 & 2 of Miami Vice. Wanna see Michael Mann take the campy out of his TV series with a mediocre big screen adaptation? See 2006's Miami Vice.There really isn't much resemblance between Mann's 2006 feature film and the 80s TV series. In fact, I'm not sure why Mann even chose to stick with the TV series connection; I think that he could have re-titled the movie and characters with the same effect: an average buddy/cop movie. But indeed the characters are the same Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell in the film/Don Johnson in the series) and Rico Tubbs (Jamie Foxx in the film/Phillip Michael Thomas in the series).Perhaps the idea was that the Miami Vice name would draw more gate at the box office? If so, either someone was seriously mistaken based on a box office that was half of what it cost to make the film, or there just were never really that many Miami Vice TV series fans as was portrayed by its Neilson ratings from 1984 - 1990.The film was entertaining. A fairly involved story. Some good action. Acting was decent; exactly what you'd expect from Farrell and Foxx. Several silly movie mistakes in conjunction with a couple of guys that were supposed to be deep under cover. The movie was bit long; I don't how long the theatrical version was, but the director's cut I viewed was over 2 hours.

Beautifully shot, awesome music, excellent acting.  Unfortunately, Michael Mann, the creator of the Miami Vice television show, decided to remake the show for the big screen and the resulting movie is far inferior.Unfortunately, even Collin Ferrell and Jamie Foxx cannot save this movie.  For some bizarre reason, the producers chose not to use any of the original music or to even re-do the original music.  The Miami Vice theme song was a top ten Billboard hit when the show first aired, and is still considered one of the best instrumental rock songs of all time.  Jan Hammer's haunting music was one of the great things about the original series.  Unfortunately, the only musical reference to the original series is a poorly done remake of Phil Collin's ""In the Air Tonight"".The use of pastel colors, one of the trademarks of the original series, gives way to a much darker atmosphere.  There is some nice cinematography, but even that goes on for far too long, especially because the music is not interesting enough to make the visuals intersting enough for the length of the shot.  The plot is muddy and takes unexplained turns, leaving the viewer scratching their head.Do not waste your time watching this movie.

You'll probably have a headache after watching it! It's pretty low-key in comparison with the T.V. series, but this film version is truer to Mann's original vision. Thankfully it's not a buddy-buddy cop caper movie and we don't witness the usual inane banter and wisecracking. However, if i have one criticism of this and most other Michael Mann movies it's that they have absolutely no humour in them. Heat could be regarded as an exception but that's down to Al Pacino's overacting rather than director's input! That said Miami Vice is pretty riveting stuff. Jamie Foxx is good enough in the role but doesn't have too much to do. However Colin Farrell is totally miscast. He's looks like an early twenty-something playing dress-up, and dress-up with a mullet and tache no less! (by his appearance i imagine he was intending to audition for a Metallica bio-pic but wandered into the wrong room) They should have got a more mature actor for this role. I mean we're supposed to believe that Foxx and Farrell have been together for years and trust each other implicity. It just doesn't work with Farrell in the roll. Also, he has zero chemistry with Gong-Li, but it's hard to blame Farrell for that as I couldn't understand a word she said in the whole movie. She should have had a translater. I surprised Farrell didn't say ""pardon?"" or ""come again?"" at least once to her. I don't dislike Farrell but he's extremely limited and I think he's more ideally suited to those slick, cocky roles that Cruise used to do in the '80s - Top Gun, Color of Money, Days of Thunder - where action sequences would distract from his limitations. Excellent direction by Mann and good entertainment throughout but doubtful you're wife or girlfriend would watch it with you, unless she wants to see Colin Farrell dressed up as a redneck!",4,Good but not great,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,1889,"['literally', 'very', 'dark', 'movie', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'going', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'headache', 'watching', 'pretty', 'low-key', 'comparison', 'T.V', 'series', 'film', 'version', 'truer', 'Mann', 'original', 'vision', 'Thankfully', 'not', 'buddy-buddy', 'cop', 'caper', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'witness', 'usual', 'inane', 'banter', 'wisecracking', 'However', 'i', 'have', 'one', 'criticism', 'most', 'other', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'movies', 'have', 'absolutely', 'humour', 'Heat', 'could', 'be', 'regarded', 'exception', 'down', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'overacting', 'rather', 'director', 'input', 'said', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'pretty', 'riveting', 'stuff', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'good', 'enough', 'role', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'do', 'However', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'totally', 'miscast', 'looks', 'early', 'twenty-something', 'playing', 'dress-up', 'dress-up', 'mullet', 'tache', 'no', 'less', 'appearance', 'i', 'imagine', 'was', 'intending', 'audition', 'Metallica', 'bio-pic', 'wandered', 'wrong', 'room', 'should', 'have', 'got', 'more', 'mature', 'actor', 'role', 'mean', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'Foxx', 'Farrell', 'have', 'been', 'together', 'years', 'trust', 'other', 'implicity', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'Farrell', 'roll', 'Also', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'Gong-Li', 'hard', 'blame', 'Farrell', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'word', 'said', 'whole', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'translater', 'surprised', 'Farrell', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'pardon', 'come', 'again', 'least', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'dislike', 'Farrell', 'extremely', 'limited', 'think', 'more', 'ideally', 'suited', 'slick', 'cocky', 'roles', 'Cruise', 'used', 'do', ""'80s"", 'Top', 'Gun', 'Color', 'Money', 'Days', 'Thunder', 'where', 'action', 'sequences', 'would', 'distract', 'limitations', 'Excellent', 'direction', 'Mann', 'good', 'entertainment', 'doubtful', ""'re"", 'wife', 'girlfriend', 'would', 'watch', 'see', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'dressed', 'up', 'redneck']",N/A
1025346,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B000J4QWM2,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[0, 1]","So I was late to the party again, which is to say I finally saw ""Miami Vice"" more than two years after it debuted.  I do remember catching the trailer in the theater and liking in particular the Linkin Park song, ""Numb,"" which played over the atmospheric visuals.  Could this be another stunner from Michael Mann, whose films might best be labeled ""adult contemporary,"" that, unbelievable as it sounds, in a good way?  Well, then Jamie Foxx appeared on the screen . . . and then so did Colin Farrell, two actors who almost without fail inspire me to watch something without them in it.  Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas may not have had Oscar-winning careers, but they were eminently more interesting than these two.Speaking of the original series, people nowadays -- especially those who never actually watched ""Miami Vice"" -- tend to remember it for the iconic and occasionally comic fashions, but the reality is that the show was much better produced than most at the time.  Mann's demand for crisp visuals, movie-like camera setups, and use of popular music gave ""Miami Vice"" a cinematic quality that TV in the 80s, with the possible exception of a smattering of programs like St. Elsewhere and The Equalizer, simply did not have.  In fact, the constant comparisons of the TV series to music videos in those days was as inaccurate then as comparing the TV series to the film is today.That is to say that essential characters and the slow, brooding way in which Mann presents them are about the only things the film has obviously in common with the original show.  The bright pastels -- tampered with briefly in the original series -- are replaced with the darker tones of the post-Grunge world.  If scenes were mostly sun-kissed in the original, they are mostly moon-punched in this one.  In fact, one of the surprising things about the film ""Miami Vice"" is how little of the city we actually see, compared to the insides of dank nightclubs or the cockpits of cigarette boats roaring across a bay at sunset.  This is a film that takes the term ""criminal underworld"" literally.If you watch ""Miami Vice"" for a story, you're likely to be disappointed.  Despite some globetrotting changes of scenery, the plot is an uncomplicated crib of any number of TV episodes where Crockett and Tubbs, though less simpatico this time around, team up undercover to foil a smarmy, deadly drug kingpin with a Latin name and nouveau riche lifestyle.  Creepy-looking thugs help him out, just as more pleasant people are allies to our heroes.  There's dialogue, some of it quite effective, some of it quite flowery, some of it mumbled by Farrell in ways that make it incomprehensible, but all of this is really secondary to the aural and visual craft that Mann brings to the screen.  He's always been expert at scenes where characters don't say anything at all, where emotions roil to the surface through a look or their stoicism in the moment, and here Mann is in top form.  Best of all, the two strongest action scenes -- a rescue scene and the film's climax -- are as good as anything he's ever filmed, perhaps better.  And once again, Mann knows how to punctuate a scene with pop music that you would nonetheless assume must have been written precisely for that scene.In most ways, ""Miami Vice"" is more of a drama than an action film, and that is sure to disappoint audiences looking for more shoot 'em ups than this film wants or ever really promises to deliver -- its sensibility might best be compared to ""To Live and Die in LA.""  Some viewers might also be distracted by Farrell's need for a haircut and shower or Foxx's desperate quest to find another expression besides moderately annoyed.  And Jan Hammer's original theme is nowhere to be found.

This movie is one long boring set-up to an underwhelming ending that leaves one feeling like they'd wasted far too much time on this soundtrack-heavy warmed-over 80's style re-envisioning. Colin Farrell is plodding and emotionless, save the narrow band of feelings conveyed when he opens his eyes wide, Jamie Foxx is wasted with banal cop talk, and the movie, which tries unsuccessfully to convey the empty pointless angst of the tv show, ends up being an utterly tired cliche of a movie. Perhaps most heinous, the remarkably talented Gong Li is utterly miscast and thus wasted. Maybe some day she'll get a starring vehicle in a Hollywood film (her role in Memoirs of a Geisha was secondary) that will truly show western audiences her talents, but for now we have to suffer through crap like this.There was no one you cared for in the movie, nothing new to show (South American drug dealers?

I personally really liked the movie. I think if you go in expecting sockless loafers and hot pink suits, you will be sorely disappointed.Now, I'd just like to say that the picture quality of this disc is absolutely stunning. There were several moments where my mouth dropped in sheer disbelief at the beautiful images on the screen. If the HD/DVD combo disc actually looks better, I'm gonna have to see it for myself to believe it. One of the best looking discs of the year, hands down.Sound is pretty nice also. There are several action sequences where the gunshots pack a nice, clean punch and will work your speakers out a bit. Music and dialogue is all clear as well but if I had to make a suggestion, I'd say watch the movie with the subtitles on. The talk gets so technical at times in terms of police procedure that at times you might be left scratching your head or reaching for your remote to rewind the last five minutes of dialogue. Try it and see.I liked the extras on the disc and while it's not as expansive as I would've liked, it does have a great Michael Mann commentary.This is a nice DVD to show off your system with.

And the rescue scene of one of the agents put you on the edge for about 10 minutes. And the rest was la-la land.A lot of the people were fidgeting around and kept leaving and coming back in hopes the dam* thing would pick itself up and become a movie.

1025353,A1NUA9J2JJQW0C,B000J4QWM2,"The Dilettante ""Dilly!""","[3, 6]","I have loved all of Michael Mann's other movies - from Manhunter to Collateral, but this one is a dud.  It's melodramatic, poorly-acted and plodding, with all sorts of preposterous flourishes that make suspension of disbelief a real chore.For instance: Gong Li's character is supposed to be a second-generation Chinese-Cuban whose mother went with Che to fight in Angola...etc...but that's about all I could understood, since she speaks with such a thick Chinese accent.  Exactly what this exotic biography adds to story (except 30 mins of screen time) is unclear to me -maybe I am missing something there- but it seems obvious that no second-generation Cuban citizen would still sound Chinese.The whole movie is like that - which is frustrating, because it could have been SO GOOD with just an ounce of realism.  But rather than include all of those interesting details of drug policing that made the original series gritty, Mann opts for a James Bond-style multinational espionage fantasy.  And with the tone of the film, this just doesn't work.  Filmed almost entirely in blue, and scored with dark alternative music, Miami Vice isn't just moody, it's downright depressive.Of course, it is very, very pretty.  As always, Mann's cinematography is above perfect.  Every frame could be a postcard.

1025354,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B000J4QWM2,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[3, 5]","I realize that when a remake is made from a television series (or a movie) there is some element of creative liberties.  This can be a good thing or a bad thing.  Many people will report that this new rendition is either too much like the original or such an insult to the original it is heresy.  I have to be honest I am not really thrilled about taking old television shows and remaking them.  This type of exercise demonstrates that Hollywood is really running low on the idea tank for new films.I mean how many more retro TV shows are going to be made into blockbuster movies? Here are the obituaries of classic TV shows that (I feel) were butchered as movies.* Bewitched* The Dukes of Hazard* Fat Albert* Charlie's Angels (and there was a sequel)* Scooby Doo (and ""sigh"" there was a sequel)* Starsky & HutchThis is just to list a few, yet I know I am forgetting a couple.So here we have the remake of ""Miami Vice"" (2006) and this DVD features an unrated director's cut.  I didn't see this movie in the theater so I have no idea what was added to the D-Cut.  I must admit I didn't have the highest expectations going into this movie.  However, I found myself really enjoying the first 20 to 30 minutes.  Then the movie really went down the toilet.Jamie Foxx is an excellent actor, being able to pull off action, drama and comedy beautifully.  Nevertheless, Jamie Foxx is wasted in this movie.  Anything I have seen Colin Farrell in has been a disappointment; S.W.A.T. keeps coming to my mind.  (Hold on, wasn't that an old TV series too? I believe it was and the movie sucked.)  However I have to give Farrell credit, his American accent in this movie was amazing.  He did a hell of a job.  In contrast, I don't know what he was trying to do with the mustache in this movie.As for the chemistry between Foxx and Farrell, I didn't think it was there.  After all this was the heart of the ""Miami Vice"".  The interaction between Sonny (Don Johnson) and Rico (Philip Michael Thomas) was great.  Watching this movie it is painfully apparent that the ""new"" Sonny (Colin Farrell) and Rico (Jamie Foxx) have a transparent relationship when in juxtaposition to their predecessors.Now this movie is called ""Miami Vice"" right? So with this type of title one would be lead to the conclusion that the movie would take place in Miami.  Not so much.  Most of the movie takes place out of the United States, South America and/or Cuba or other unknown places; I must admit the cinematography was beautiful.  Consequently this isn't a National Geographic special, it is an action movie.  Where was I? Oh, Sonny and Rico go undercover after being brought in by the FBI and/or CIA to deal with heavy duty drug dealers.  I still find it dubious that two Miami police officers would be brought into an international drug/customs affair.  In retrospect this plot element can be almost forgiven.This movie lacks any real action or suspense.  ""Miami Vice"" (unrated director's cut) clocks at about two and a half hours long.  In this given timeframe there are only two real action sequences, sorry racing boats don't count in my opinion.  This format really produces a very sloppy and clumsy paced movie.  Not to mention there is an unnecessary love interest for Sonny.  Sonny's sordid love interest is ""the bad guy's girl"" and seems moot, not to mention it takes a lot of screen time away from Rico. There was also a scene with a residential trailer and shoddy CGI, I just laughed. I digress to the first 20 to 30 minutes of regulation of this film.  The pace was good, Sonny and Rico were working together, there was a bit of suspense and THEY WERE IN MIAMI!!!!While I wasn't expecting the ""white suites"", peachy music and pseudo 80s cheese that made the television show great.  I was expecting a new twist on Miami Vice, yet still keeping the integrity of the original.  This movie had the potential to have this ""new twist"".  The version of this ""Miami Vice"" was gritty and dark, giving the film a more modern feel.  This is good because Miami in 2006 is different than it was in the1980s. Sadly after the first thirty minutes this movie just ran out of gas.In conclusion, this movie might have been good if it wasn't called ""Miami Vice"", or if the movie had more action, or more interaction with the two leads, or if Colin lost the mustache.  This movie just left a bad taste in my mouth.  With regards to retro television show being remade as movies, ""The Land of the Lost"" (a favorite TV show of mine) is being remade and released this summer.  I feel the forecast for this film will be disaster.",1,Not sure what I watched or where Miami went,1153958400,"07 27, 2006",2006,4581,"['realize', 'when', 'remake', 'made', 'television', 'series', 'movie', 'element', 'creative', 'liberties', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'bad', 'thing', 'Many', 'people', 'will', 'report', 'new', 'rendition', 'either', 'too', 'much', 'original', 'such', 'insult', 'original', 'heresy', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'thrilled', 'taking', 'old', 'television', 'shows', 'remaking', 'type', 'exercise', 'Hollywood', 'really', 'running', 'low', 'idea', 'tank', 'new', 'films.I', 'mean', 'how', 'many', 'more', 'retro', 'TV', 'shows', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'made', 'blockbuster', 'movies', 'Here', 'are', 'obituaries', 'classic', 'TV', 'shows', 'feel', 'were', 'butchered', 'movies', 'Bewitched*', 'Dukes', 'Hazard*', 'Fat', 'Albert*', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'was', 'sequel', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'sigh', 'was', 'sequel', '*', 'Starsky', 'HutchThis', 'just', 'list', 'few', 'yet', 'know', 'am', 'forgetting', 'couple.So', 'here', 'have', 'remake', 'Miami', 'Vice', '2006', 'DVD', 'unrated', 'director', 'cut', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'theater', 'so', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'added', 'D-Cut', 'must', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'highest', 'expectations', 'going', 'movie', 'However', 'found', 'really', 'enjoying', 'first', '20', '30', 'minutes', 'Then', 'movie', 'really', 'went', 'toilet.Jamie', 'Foxx', 'excellent', 'actor', 'being', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'action', 'drama', 'comedy', 'beautifully', 'Nevertheless', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'wasted', 'movie', 'Anything', 'have', 'seen', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'been', 'disappointment', 'S.W.A.T', 'coming', 'mind', 'Hold', 'was', ""n't"", 'old', 'TV', 'series', 'too', 'believe', 'was', 'movie', 'sucked', 'However', 'have', 'give', 'Farrell', 'credit', 'American', 'accent', 'movie', 'was', 'amazing', 'did', 'hell', 'job', 'contrast', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'mustache', 'movie.As', 'chemistry', 'Foxx', 'Farrell', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'heart', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'interaction', 'Sonny', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'Rico', 'Philip', 'Michael', 'Thomas', 'was', 'great', 'Watching', 'movie', 'painfully', 'apparent', 'new', 'Sonny', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Rico', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'have', 'transparent', 'relationship', 'when', 'juxtaposition', 'predecessors.Now', 'movie', 'called', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'right', 'So', 'type', 'title', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'lead', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'would', 'take', 'place', 'Miami', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'Most', 'movie', 'place', 'United', 'States', 'South', 'America', 'Cuba', 'other', 'unknown', 'places', 'must', 'admit', 'cinematography', 'was', 'beautiful', 'Consequently', ""n't"", 'National', 'Geographic', 'special', 'action', 'movie', 'Where', 'was', 'Oh', 'Sonny', 'Rico', 'go', 'undercover', 'being', 'brought', 'FBI', 'and/or', 'CIA', 'deal', 'heavy', 'duty', 'drug', 'dealers', 'still', 'find', 'dubious', 'two', 'Miami', 'police', 'officers', 'would', 'be', 'brought', 'international', 'drug/customs', 'affair', 'retrospect', 'plot', 'element', 'can', 'be', 'almost', 'forgiven.This', 'movie', 'real', 'action', 'suspense', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'unrated', 'director', 'cut', 'clocks', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'given', 'timeframe', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'real', 'action', 'sequences', 'sorry', 'racing', 'boats', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'opinion', 'format', 'really', 'very', 'sloppy', 'clumsy', 'paced', 'movie', 'Not', 'mention', 'unnecessary', 'love', 'interest', 'Sonny', 'Sonny', 'sordid', 'love', 'interest', 'bad', 'guy', 'girl', 'moot', 'not', 'mention', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'away', 'Rico', 'was', 'also', 'scene', 'residential', 'trailer', 'shoddy', 'CGI', 'just', 'laughed', 'digress', 'first', '20', '30', 'minutes', 'regulation', 'film', 'pace', 'was', 'good', 'Sonny', 'Rico', 'were', 'working', 'together', 'was', 'bit', 'suspense', 'THEY', 'WERE', 'IN', 'MIAMI', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'white', 'suites', 'peachy', 'music', 'pseudo', '80s', 'cheese', 'made', 'television', 'show', 'great', 'was', 'expecting', 'new', 'twist', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'yet', 'still', 'keeping', 'integrity', 'original', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'have', 'new', 'twist', 'version', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'was', 'gritty', 'dark', 'giving', 'film', 'more', 'modern', 'feel', 'good', 'Miami', '2006', 'different', 'was', 'the1980s', 'Sadly', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'just', 'ran', 'gas.In', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'called', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'movie', 'had', 'more', 'action', 'more', 'interaction', 'two', 'leads', 'Colin', 'lost', 'mustache', 'movie', 'just', 'left', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'regards', 'retro', 'television', 'show', 'being', 'remade', 'movies', 'Land', 'Lost', 'favorite', 'TV', 'show', 'mine', 'being', 'remade', 'released', 'summer', 'feel', 'forecast', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'disaster']",N/A
1025355,A1X6M6IINHDSRC,B000J4QWM2,Thor,"[4, 5]","As I saw the trailer I knew what to expect: A motion picture which was based on the hit series from the 80's, but was nothing like the series. I was right.But still: Michael Mann, the great director of ""Heat"" and ""Colleteral"" has made a great picture which has a lot of style, vibe and feeling.But: it just isn't Miami Vice.Fans from the series from the 80's starring Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas will be dissapointed. The only thing the movie has in commen with the series are the names of the main characters and the city: Miami. For the rest it's just a ride full of style and darkness. No real humor, which the series had, just gritty reality. There isn't much action. A few action scenes here and there and the most realistic gunfight I've ever seen at the end.The thing that keeps the movie alive and me gluded in the theaterseat is the style and the feeling. Michael Mann has once again made a movie with a vibe that is great entertainment.Also, the acting is on a high level, Collin Farrel and Jamie Foxx are fantastic as Crockett and Tubes, and give the heroes a totally new kind of character which is very different from the actors in the series.Another point that is good is the romance. The depth of the romance is deeper than I expected and shows a Crockett who's truly in love.The locations are true eye candy. Great lighting, buildings and rooms which capture the mood perfectly. Also, fantastic shots of the city and nature will make your heart beat faster.Another thing that helps with the style of the film, is the way it's filmed. Camera-angles that put you right in the action and situations: a great job.So, being a Drama film, more than an action film, Miami Vice has elements that can make you hate it, but also can make you like it, which I did most.So although this movie called Miami Vice isn't Miami Vice, it has a great atmosphere and style that will keep you watching and making you, may it be slowly, fall in love with this motion picture.",4,Miami Vice that isn't Miami Vice,1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,1978,"['saw', 'trailer', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'motion', 'picture', 'was', 'based', 'hit', 'series', '80', 'was', 'nothing', 'series', 'was', 'right.But', 'still', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'great', 'director', 'Heat', 'Colleteral', 'made', 'great', 'picture', 'lot', 'style', 'vibe', 'feeling.But', 'just', ""n't"", 'Miami', 'Vice.Fans', 'series', '80', 'starring', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'Philip', 'Michael', 'Thomas', 'will', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'commen', 'series', 'are', 'names', 'main', 'characters', 'city', 'Miami', 'rest', 'just', 'ride', 'full', 'style', 'darkness', 'real', 'humor', 'series', 'had', 'just', 'gritty', 'reality', ""n't"", 'much', 'action', 'few', 'action', 'scenes', 'here', 'there', 'most', 'realistic', 'gunfight', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'end.The', 'thing', 'movie', 'alive', 'gluded', 'theaterseat', 'style', 'feeling', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'once', 'again', 'made', 'movie', 'vibe', 'great', 'entertainment.Also', 'acting', 'high', 'level', 'Collin', 'Farrel', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Crockett', 'Tubes', 'give', 'heroes', 'totally', 'new', 'kind', 'character', 'very', 'different', 'actors', 'series.Another', 'point', 'good', 'romance', 'depth', 'romance', 'deeper', 'expected', 'Crockett', 'who', 'truly', 'love.The', 'locations', 'are', 'true', 'eye', 'candy', 'Great', 'lighting', 'buildings', 'rooms', 'capture', 'mood', 'perfectly', 'Also', 'fantastic', 'shots', 'city', 'nature', 'will', 'make', 'heart', 'beat', 'faster.Another', 'thing', 'style', 'film', 'way', 'filmed', 'Camera-angles', 'put', 'right', 'action', 'situations', 'great', 'job.So', 'being', 'Drama', 'film', 'more', 'action', 'film', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'elements', 'can', 'make', 'hate', 'also', 'can', 'make', 'did', 'most.So', 'movie', 'called', 'Miami', 'Vice', ""n't"", 'Miami', 'Vice', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'style', 'will', 'keep', 'watching', 'making', 'may', 'be', 'slowly', 'fall', 'love', 'motion', 'picture']",N/A
1025356,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000J4QWM2,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 1]","Detective Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Detective Rico Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) are in the middle of an undercover operation at a trendy Miami nightclub when they receive a call from Alonzo Stevens (John Hawkes, HBO's ""Deadwood""), one of their informants. Very distraught, he tells them an undercover FBI team has been made and will probably get killed during a drug deal with some Aryan gang members. They also have his wife hostage until the deal is completed. The detectives manage to track Alonzo down and talk to him, but they aren't able to save his wife. Soon, FBI Agent Fujima (Ciaran Hands) recruits Crockett and Tubbs, with the consent of Lt. Castillo (Barry Shabaka Henley), to go undercover and expose the people behind the deal. They soon meet Jose Yero (John Ortiz) and Isabella (Gong Li), the advisor to Archangel de Jesus Montoya (Luis Tosar), the head of the organization they are trying to infiltrate.""Miami Vice"", written and directed by Michael Mann (""Heat"", ""Collateral""), is a stylish, sleek, stunningly beautiful update of the seminal 80s television show. Michael Mann is a great filmmaker culling all of the technical expertise at his fingertips to create films that are compelling and extremely watchable. But ""Vice"" has some problems which prevent it from joining the ranks of Mann's best. But even Mann's flawed films are heads and shoulders above most other filmmakers.Mann thrusts us into the lives of Crockett and Tubbs as we join them in the middle of a stakeout. They are in a fashionable Miami nightclub watching some criminals when Crockett receives the call from his informant. As soon as they receive the call, the main story begins. Mann doesn't set aside any screen time for us to stop and get to know either character; we learn everything as we go. Crockett and Tubbs are very dedicated to their job and willing to go deep undercover to uncover a large scale drug operation. They also clearly respect their supervisor, Lt. Castillo, yet seem to hold other law enforcement agencies in disregard. Tubbs (Foxx) and one of the detectives on their team, Trudy (Naomie Harris) are close, sharing a relationship, when there is time. Crockett (Farrell) is not above flirting with women, even while on assignment, which eventually leads him into the arms of Isabella (Gong Li). We learn all of this as it happens, building our impressions of the characters as the film continues.This is an interesting method of developing the narrative. On the one hand, Mann grabs our attention, placing us in the middle of this universe, letting us figure things out. We immediately have to pay attention, to keep up with the events surrounding Crockett and Tubbs or someone will lose their lives. Maybe even us. Mann makes us an active participant. As we watch these two, they learn the same information we learn. Since we are an active participant, it makes their world all the more real to us.On the other hand, this narrative technique mean some, in fact, too many, characters are simply just `there'. As Crockett and Tubbs go undercover, we see two guys, members of their team, following them around, but we never learn anything about them. I don't think I ever even heard their names. They are simply there, providing backup, and during the climactic final gun battle, they prove useful because they can provide the good guys with more guns.Mann's best film ""Heat"" redefined the cops and robbers genre. One of the many reasons for this is he took the time to give every single character in the film a back-story, giving us details about their lives outside of their label as ""cops and robbers"", providing the film with unbelievable depth. Every single person on both Hannah's (Pacino) and McCauley's (DeNiro) teams seemed more human because we knew something about them and their lives. And the two main characters are given unbelievable depth by delving into the characters beyond what is necessary for the story. I know some complain about the scenes between Pacino and Natalie Portman, who plays his step-daughter. Why are those necessary? Strictly speaking, they aren't necessary to the story but they help define his character and explain why he is so determined to catch DeNiro. There are even two or three scenes depicting Dennis Haysbert's character's life and he is introduced very late, as DeNiro's new driver. All of this information creates a rich backdrop for the action that takes place, making those memorable action scenes even more unforgettable.Another thing all of this information does is make us care about even the bad guys, whether McCauley and his crew make it out of the situation alive, even though they are killing people right and left to escape. It's a nifty narrative technique that isn't used enough.But Mann doesn't do this in ""Vice"" and strictly speaking, he doesn't have to. But it would've made the film all the more memorable.As we get involved in the action, we become engrossed in a very detailed plot involving a lot of moving parts. The story is complicated, but Mann keeps all of the elements moving, making it easier to follow along. This is no simple undercover operation and Crockett and Tubbs start transporting large amounts of drugs into the country, to earn the confidence of Montoya (Tosar), a scary man who is into a lot of crooked activity. As they start to uncover the various layers, Crockett flirts with Isabella (Gong Li), Montoya's advisor and lover. Is it an attempt to curry favor or is he actually attracted to her? Crockett asks her to go out for a drink. She accepts and asks what he likes to drink. When he responds ""Mojitos"", she says she knows a place and they speed off in Crockett's luxury boat. Their destination? Havana, where Isabella has a house. As their relationship develops, it becomes clear Crockett has a thing for her, yet he never lets it interfere with his status as an undercover agent, he maintains his cover.Gong Li is another significant problem. She is very good as a mysterious figure in Montoya's operation, soon revealing she is more than Yero's (Ortiz) moll, she is actually Yero's boss, in a way. As a figure of power and mystery, she is quite good. But as her relationship with Crockett develops and they become more conversational, she loses all of her power. When Isabella is authoritative and threatening, she appears slightly mysterious and Gong Li is allowed to carefully enunciate every word, we can both understand her and recognize her power. But in a normal conversation, it becomes almost impossible to understand her. She is a beautiful woman, but because we can't understand much of what she is saying, it makes it difficult to care about her.Mann has been creating a unique visual style in his last few films, experimenting with high definition video. In ""Collateral"", most of the film takes place during a single night in Los Angeles. His high def camera captures a grainy, unique view of the city at night; dark, grainy, punctuated by bright neon and flashes of color. Exteriors are grainy and flat. Interiors are bathed in saturated colors.In ""Vice"", Mann's cinematographer Dion Beebe captures a stunning panorama of images. An early scene on the rooftop of a nightclub shows Crockett and Tubbs against a nighttime sky flat with gray, but glowing with the light of Miami below. A lightning crack punctuates the horizon. Even though each character appears slightly flat, this technique gives them the impression of appearing 3-D. This is all familiar to anyone who has seen ""Collateral"", but no less interesting or stunning.But much of the new film also takes place during the day and Beebe's high definition cinematography is simply stunning. In one scene, the camera pans over the beginning of a waterfall before revealing the rushing water and a mansion at the edge of a cliff. As Crockett's boat speeds across the water to Havana, we can almost feel the spray hitting us in the face. When they are in Havana, every color and weathered board seems to pop out. The film is stunning to watch, simply for the breathtaking cinematography.""Vice"" is definitely one of the better films of the summer, with many pluses in it's favor. It's also a film you should see on the big screen, for the involving action and great cinematography. But it's lack of character development also robs the film of some of it's power. You will be hard pressed to remember any characters except for Crockett and Tubbs.",4,"""Vice"" is Nice, But Too Much Ice",1154390400,"08 1, 2006",2006,8420,"['Detective', 'Sonny', 'Crockett',

I'm afraid Michael Mann is starting to lose his writing and storytelling skills, however.  It seems that with each passing feature, Mann is more concerned with the choreography of the visual and not so concerned with the actual substance:""How fast does that boat go?""""It goes very fast.""Wow!!'Miami Vice' is a improbable film that has more holes in it than a practice green.  Pancho and Lefty go deep undercover to try and corral the narcotics operation that is taking over South America, Latin America and South Beach.  They somehow win the trust of this billion dollar operation in the course of four minutes and begin trafficking the nose blow for the bad guys.That isn't good enough, however.  It seems the DEA and FBI didn't know that the organization they were after is simply a tiny apartment in a 40 story complex.  of course, Tom and Jerry need to go after the kingpin, for some odd reason (and a reason that is never resolved by the end of the film).  Maybe it's because it gives us an additional hour and a half to hear Colin Ferrell talk like Dr. Phil with a voice box.There is a needless love story between one of the worst, most over dramatized performances in recent memory (Farrell) and a even worse performance (a Asian woman who sounds like Ch Chi Rodriguez).

Those `bad' guys all speak English with heavy accent, live in a luxurious house with a beautiful woman who is also his lover. And ... but wait. Isn't this familiar?Because of the acute shortage of good script, Hollywood decided to call this clich&eacute;d story `Miami Vice,' not knowing that what they are doing has been done repeatedly.[SONNY AND RICO] And Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx as Sonny and Rico? And Gong Li as Sonny's lover? I'm ready to admit they are all gifted actors, but there is nothing between Farrell and Foxx that makes me believe their friendship, nor chemistry between Li and Farrell. It is terribly embarrassing to see Gong Li, internationally acclaimed actress, doing these obligatory `love scene' that should be more suitable for cheesy melodramas.If director Michael Mann intended to create a melodrama (which should not be necessarily cheesy, however), his new `Miami Vice' is a total failure, because melodramas usually have a much more interesting story. Mann's stylish images barely hide the fact, but the film is really a standard cop thriller with formulaic set-pieces. In his previous `Collateral' it worked thanks to the exceptional acting from the leads, but without the tension between the characters, you just cannot expect another success.Feature film version `Miami Vice' based on the hugely popular 80s TV series should be seen as a completely independent project, Even as such it lacks originality, and is short of actions.

You know with Mann you are going to get really cool music, cool characters and great cinematography. But this movie just had stupid things that I just could not overcome. First Crockett and Tubbs are suppose to be infiltrating a drug cartel because there is an informant on the inside of the DEA and FBI that is tipping off the said cartel. The cartel is described as very powerful and involved in not only selling drugs but also in black market and arms dealing. It is said to be one of the most vicious and intelligent cartels and that it killed people at the drop of a hat. Soooooooooooooooooooooo Crockett and Tubbs infiltrate the cartel and when leaving the first meeting they are having with them Crockett asks the lady villian who is one of the heads of this cabal of murderers, ""would you like to have a drink with me?"" As they are leaving Tubbs says, ""Sonny..."" ""It's ok... I know what I am doing."" So what does this idiot do? He goes off and has sex with her right off the bat. NOW she comes back to the cartel and her lover who is the big boss and tells him right off, "" I slept with Burnette (Crockett) to which he says, ""Good girl"". So I can accept that because she is a cold calculating tramp who will do anything to manipulate for the business. Crockett, he is just a moron for sleeping with this murdering drug dealer. Sooooooooooooo then later when the head of the cartels intelligence wants to get Crockett and Tubbs killed says, "" I have something to show you."" He pulls out a lap top and shows the head of the cartel Crockett and the girl... DANCING!!!! The man is so outraged he orders Crockett and Tubbs killed. Now, he doesn't care they slept together but he goes into a homicidal rage cause they danced together. MORONIC. Then and this is a SPOILER ALERT!!!!:In the end when they have a gun battle between the cops and the bad guys Crockett helps this drug dealing murdering woman escape, with the aid and assistance of Tubbs who sees them and turns his back. Tubbs, looking deeply into Crocketts eyes, ""I will NEVER doubt you,"" to Crockett was the definition of homoerotic man love. So Crockett, blinded by his 1 or 2 day sexual encounter decides that he no longer is a law enforcement officer and that this woman who was probably directly or indirectly responsible for countless murders as well as selling guns and drugs should be set free. He is the judge and jury just because he had sex with this criminal scum.This movie was just stupid. And Tubbs character was just like the one on the show. It was completely over shadowed by Crockett and given a token relationship and just enough of a part so he didn't look totally like a side kick/ token partner. Again, this movie was stupid.

However, I wasn't expecting much, since remakes and screen adaptations of TV shows usually flop. But Miami Vice is an exception to this trend - the acting is very good, the action is explosive, and the cinemetography is outstanding with beautiful settings along South Beach, the Florida Keys, Cuba, and Colombia. Colin Farrel and Jamie Fox star as the legendary Crockett and Tubbs.However, the film is not perfect and there are some criticisms that deserve mention. First, other than the Crockett and Tubbs characters, there isn't much connection to Miami Vice. Secondary characters, such as Gina, Trudy, Switek, Zito, and Castillo - all of which played very important roles in the TV series - are nearly non-existent in the film and only play very minor roles. Also, the movie loses a good degree of Crockett's and Tubb's personas that were so pervasive in the TV program (Crockett as the ubersexual, wise-cracking macho man and Tubbs as the sharp-dressed slickster from the Bronx). Farrel and Fox give good performances, but the movie portrays them as robot-like killing machines more so than than the Crockett and Tubbs fans of the series will remember.But the movie is fairly good overall...it just doesn't quite feel like ""Miami Vice.""

It literally got such bad reviews from the major movie critcs (except Richard Roeper) that I didn't want to make the effort.  I purchased the DVD with the Director's Unrated Cut on it a couple of days ago out of pure boredom.  I needed something new to watch and was hoping that maybe the Director's Cut of this film would be better than the theatrical version.  Since I didn't the threaterical version, I can't compare the two.  What I can say, however, is that I really liked this movie and look forward to watching it again in a few days.  Maybe it's because I wasn't expecting too much.  I think Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell did a good job protraying the characters of Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs.  I believed them as undercover cops.  I also enjoyed the plot line of them having to infiltrate an international drug cartel and the complications that arised from it.  I mean there's only so many plot lines that a writer can use for undercover vice cops.  The style and feel of the movie was great.  The action was adequately spaced and well choreographed.  I bought into the love interest between Farrell's character and Gong Li's.  All in all, I think it was a pretty good Michael Mann movie.  Like with other reviewers, it did remind me a little bit of Mann's earlier movie, Heat.  As far as Bonus Features go, there's about forty-five minutes of behind the scenes stuff on the disc (along with Colin Farrell being punked by some real-life undercover vice cops), and a nice commentary to the movie by Mr. Mann.  The only reason I'm not giving the movie a 5-Star rating is because there were a few places where I got confused with what was going on, or what was being said between the characters.  I also think that the film was left open-ended.  The head of the drug cartel managed to slip away (actually, he was able to empty his whole estate of everything before the local militia arrived), plus my feeling is that it isn't over between Crockett and Gong Li's character.

The series was captivating and inspiring in many ways.  The music and fashion were as much a part of the show as the plot was.  Sadly the movie does not live up to this.  I felt the movie storyline stayed true to the original characters and the plot would have made for a solid episode, but there was nothing special about the movie.  The movie gets by on its name and the longing of the watcher to go back to and relive the 80's.

1025374,A1JJK67VXR1WSR,B000J4QWM2,William R. Hancock,"[2, 3]","Watching this film I came to the conclusion that the only reason this movie was titled ""Miami Vice"" , and the main characters called Crockett and Tubbs, was an intent by producer-creator Anthony Yerkovich and producer-writer-director Michael Mann to capitalise on the ""name"" power and fan base of the original television series.This film and its characters were so utterly different from what the tv series was about in terms of personality and style that they have next to nothing in common. Mann could have called this ""Smugglers' Blues"" and named his characters Boone and Staggs (or whatever) for all the similarity there was between the two presentations.There is none of the easy comraderie here of the tv show, none of the amusing elements like Crockett living on a boat in the marina with Elvis the alligator, and none of that engaging likability of Don Johnson himself..part of what ""made"" the show. Gone, too, is that driving Jan Hammer theme music, and, very significantly, gone is that mysterious, charismatic backstop of Edward James Olmos's ""Lt. Castillo"".This, in essence,is a well written, well acted, well directed, sumptuously photographed undercover-cops-and-smugglers actionfest that is long on realistic looks at the nature of the drug business and the methodologies and psychological-emotional stresses and temptations that ""go with the territory"" of fighting it. Colin Farrell isexcellent in his role, as is Jamie Foxx in his. I just can't make the ""connect"" here between THIS Crockett & Tubbs and the much moreiconic team of Johnson and Thomas (and Olmos). The Hollywood answer to mydisconnect would be that ""Hey, it's just like switching James Bonds on you"", but the effect is more sweeping than that.Don't misunderstand me. This is a solid, enjoyable movie. Quite entertaining. There just seems to be a recognition gap between this product and what the public at large visualizes, image-wise, when it thinks ""Miami Vice"".",3,"Should have been ""Miami Undercover""",1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,1946,"['Watching', 'film', 'came', 'conclusion', 'only', 'reason', 'movie', 'was', 'titled', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'main', 'characters', 'called', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'was', 'intent', 'producer-creator', 'Anthony', 'Yerkovich', 'producer-writer-director', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'capitalise', 'name', 'power', 'fan', 'base', 'original', 'television', 'series.This', 'film', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'utterly', 'different', 'what', 'tv', 'series', 'was', 'terms', 'personality', 'style', 'have', 'next', 'nothing', 'common', 'Mann', 'could', 'have', 'called', 'Smugglers', 'Blues', 'named', 'characters', 'Boone', 'Staggs', 'similarity', 'was', 'two', 'presentations.There', 'none', 'easy', 'comraderie', 'here', 'tv', 'show', 'none', 'amusing', 'elements', 'Crockett', 'living', 'boat', 'marina', 'Elvis', 'alligator', 'none', 'engaging', 'likability', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'himself..part', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'Gone', 'too', 'driving', 'Jan', 'Hammer', 'theme', 'music', 'very', 'significantly', 'gone', 'mysterious', 'charismatic', 'backstop', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Lt.', 'Castillo', '.This', 'essence', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'directed', 'sumptuously', 'photographed', 'undercover-cops-and-smugglers', 'long', 'realistic', 'looks', 'nature', 'drug', 'business', 'methodologies', 'psychological-emotional', 'stresses', 'temptations', 'go', 'territory', 'fighting', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'isexcellent', 'role', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'connect', 'here', 'THIS', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'much', 'moreiconic', 'team', 'Johnson', 'Thomas', 'Olmos', 'Hollywood', 'answer', 'mydisconnect', 'would', 'be', 'Hey', 'just', 'switching', 'James', 'Bonds', 'effect', 'more', 'sweeping', 'that.Do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'solid', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'Quite', 'entertaining', 'just', 'be', 'recognition', 'gap', 'product', 'what', 'public', 'large', 'visualizes', 'image-wise', 'when', 'Miami', 'Vice']",N/A
1025375,A38QEATH3NODFM,B000J4QWM2,Wiseguy 945,"[1, 5]","Michael Mann gave it a good try, attempting to turn a TV series into a condenced movie version, but It just can't be done...unless they are planning sequels.  Yes, he did a great job in some of his other action films, thinking specifically of  Heat, but this is more of a Luke Warm.  The movie just lanches into Crockett and Tubbs under cover, and they reapidly progress into deep cover. But the movie had no sense of timeline, so it just seemed like it took place over a few days.  And, this movie is 130+ minutes long, and honestly i still don't see they filled this amount of time.  And the love scenes, just not nessessary, Actually detracted from the movie in my book. At the end, its the predictable drug scene gone bad, wife kidnapped and injured critically, and, of course, one of the heros, in this case Sonny, has fallen in love with a girl that he can't have...at least for now.  Anyway, this movie is a rent before buying, and make the judgement for yourself.  I guess if I was a bigger fan of the TV show, it might be pretty close to the same thing, but I always thought the TV show was kinda borish as well, except for the cool intro and theme song.",3,"Ok, but some things were better left on TV.

This film is a masterpiece other than a couple of love scenes that could've been left out but then again it wouldn't be miami vice so it's not that much of an issue. What is at stake however is the tight directing, great script, and talented acting duo of Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell. The supporters are also good.This is a film that needs to be watched more than once. The standard dvd edition does not do the movie justice and I admit I was not much of a fan at first. However with this new directer's cut blu ray, the movie is just so much tighter with minimal changes than the theatrical release. There are so many fine details in this film that you just can't ignore. If you're looking for a great drug ring crime movie than this is your match.I am not a fan of the tv series but I am a huge M Mann fan and this movie belongs next to a movie called HEAT. Maybe you've heard of it.  Not quite on the same level but all in all a great piece of work from a magnificent director. Give this film a second shot and notice how close the bond is between Foxx and Farrell's charchter's. They know each other and are best friends but they never blatantly shove it down your throat.
