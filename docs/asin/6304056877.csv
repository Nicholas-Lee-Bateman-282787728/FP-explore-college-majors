We see another woman leaving by train. A mechanic makes plans with an older man to go into the wild and capture horses. The invite the woman to go with them. [It is a slow starting film.] The dialogue brings out the personality of each character. The group starts out with a drink of whiskey (more symbolism?) ""You can't change things"" seems to be their working philosophy (see the title). So they have another drink of whiskey.On the way to the rodeo they find the third man they will need for ""mustanging"" (capturing wild horses for sale). A paddle and ball allows Roslyn to show her skills and win well over $100. The third man Pierce doesn't do well on a horse or bull. His attitude shows when they are drinking again (does he know his limits?). Their drinking brings out their problems. Finally they set out on the hunt. An old biplane is used to drive the horses into the trap. But only a few horses were found. They lasso a horse with a rope tied to an old tire. It takes three men to bring down the stallion. Roslyn's idealism drives her to an emotional outburst; she doesn't understand how to ""live in harmony with nature"". Does she know the purpose of those cattle drives in the Old West? She convinces Pierce to free the captured horses. Gabe captures the stallion again; then he sets it free. This wins Roslyn's approval. And so the film ends. Roslyn used to be a professional dancer; she danced with men for money.The message in this story is that those who are self-employed are ""misfits"" in a world where most people work for wages. Only big corporations should be allowed to exploit natural resources. [I don't believe that, do you?] The film doesn't explain how they can live in the desert without a water supply. The monetary figures are far out of date. There is one scene where you can see the extinct specie of silver coins. This film would have been better if it had a sound track (Hank Williams' songs would be appropriate). For outdoors men they all lack the expected tan skin. This film is slow moving and talky.

398799,AGEIT17HENDIS,6304056877,Alfred Johnson,"[3, 4]","What is not to like about a movie set in the modern American West where civilization is fast taking the starch out of the independent-minded cowboys and their hangers-on and they are trying to hold on for dear life. Obviously they had not read Professor Turner's thesis on  the end of the Aerican frontier. Nevertheless the code of the old West and its values was losing its effect by the day to the ethos of the modern capitalist farmer and rancher. Larry McMurtry and others have also taken up this theme but none have done it better on film.Add a screenplay by the legendary playwright Arthur Miller. Further add the strong performances, aided by the black and white format, of a grizzled Clark Gable, the ill-fated Marilyn Monroe and the troubled Montgomery Clift supported by Thelma Ritter and Eli Wallach and you have a very good film indeed. I have read that Miller's screenplay was written especially for Monroe, then his wife. If so that explains why this story about castoffs, drifters and non-conformists looking for some emotional relief in the 'new' West that has passed them by had such a powerful effect on me. Monroe as the beautiful but hard luck and misunderstood object of affection seemingly was playing herself here. And to great effect.

398800,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,6304056877,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[1, 1]","THE MISFITS (1961) is not a great movie, but a good movie, very painful to watch but well worth watching.  Roslyn Taber (Marilyn Monroe) has just finished her ""Renovation"" residency in the home of Isabelle Steers (Thelma Ritter), when local mechanic Guido (Eli Wallach) gives them a lift to the courthouse.  Afterwards, the newly divorced Roslyn is introduced by Guido to Gay Langland (Clark Gable), a semi-nomadic cowboy who takes an immediate liking to Roslyn.  The quartet heads to the Dayton (Nevada) rodeo, and along the way encounters Perce Howland (Montgomery Clift), who enters an event at the rodeo but is injured in the process.  Gay and Roslyn couple up and live in Guido's half-built house in the country; later the three men form an informal alliance to trap and sell the area's remaining mustang horses to a slaughterhouse for dog food.THE MISFITS is anything but a standard Hollywood release of its day, which to me is a good thing.  More typical Hollywood fare would have had the Clift and Gable characters in a triangle for Marilyn's affections, leaving the comedy relief to Wallach or perhaps a more rustic character like Slim Pickens.  In this film, based on Arthur Miller's screenplay, Guido tries to play for Roslyn's affections by trading on his horrific memories as a World War II flying ace, but she isn't having any.  Gable as Gay is a suitably virile if surprisingly middle-aged consort for Roslyn, and while she and Perce are soulmates the character Clift plays is too obviously wounded, both psychically and physically, to provide any hope of romantic companionship for her.  Only Thelma Ritter is reliably cast as the wisecracking Isabelle (""The [Nevada] motto should be anything goes . . .  just don't complain if it went"") but, as in some of her earlier movies (like ALL ABOUT EVE), the need for her kind of humor wanes as the movie heads into its more dramatic scenes, and the actress disappears.Contemporary audiences didn't always know quite what to make of THE MISFITS.  Some viewers regretted the absence of the typical Monroe ""dumb blonde"" character, while others felt the rootless high-school dropout she played was too dumb for the demands of the plot.  I feel she did quite well, and perhaps it took a playwright who was married to her to craft a character so close to her own life -- in particular, the abandonment issues of a motherless childhood were close to Roslyn's persona as well as Monroe's own.  Like her, Clift and Wallach were also trained in Method acting and also like her, play wounded characters, victims: Guido having been through the trauma of dropping bombs on civilians and Clift, evicted by his new stepfather from his mother's ranch he had hoped to inherit.  It was Gable, the Hollywood studio product, who felt alienated in technique from the others, but he did a fine job as the beat-up cowboy beset by changing times and the actor himself said it was the only job of ""real"" movie acting he'd ever done.Other than Ritter's quips, there are no laughs in this movie, so don't look for them. Even a scene with a high potential for drunk-funny turns drunk-tragic, when Gay fails to connect with his grown children.  Fragile and wounded Roslyn, despite her ""gift for living,"" often seems on the verge of tears and almost as often gives way to them.  So much of the dialog in this film reflects the main characters' emotional barrenness, underscored by the bleached but beautiful Northern Nevada desert.  At over fifty years' remove, it is easier to see that Miller intended to portray a changing America as well as stretch the actors' emotional range.  Gay in particular is a befuddled loner who grew up in an era when corralling Mustangs was a brave, manly and useful thing to do -- Roslyn, conveying the attitude of a much younger generation, brings home to Gay the idea that driving wild horses to the brink of extinction for a few hundred dollars' worth of dog food is not the act of a good man.Few ""outdoor"" movies have revolved so much around a quartet of actors (quintet, including Ritter), but look quickly for Estelle Winwood as a church lady gathering funds to protect the church graveyard against random grazing by the horses, and Kevin McCarthy as Roslyn Taber's soon-to-be ex.  The widescreen black-and-white print is a good one, but distortion is apparent in some of the closeup sequences and probably was on the silver screen too.  Today's DVD's show MGM's Leo at the very close of the movie, but THE MISFITS, originally released by United Artists, does not close with ""THE END,"" an almost unheard-of thing for an American movie to do in 1961.  Other than a trailer, there are no extras, a pity since any number of film scholars could have contributed Commentary from any number of angles.IMDb comparison ratings (black-and-white,

398801,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304056877,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I don't know why, but I never even really considered watching `The Misfits'.  Even when I was watching a lot of Marilyn Monroe films, I never really thought about watching this one.  A friend told me that it was coming on TCM and that she was going to be watching it, and so we decided to get together and see it together.  While I cannot say that the overall experience was what I hoped for, I must tell you that there are parts of this film that work marvelously.  Overall I was entertained and even delighted (especially during the films finale) but there are huge chunks of this film that don't work as well as they intended to.The film tells of a lonely cowboy and a young divorcee who fall in love over mutual sadness and a longing for belonging.Okay, so lets start with the good.  The acting across the board is very well done.  Both leads handle their performances with a strength that is surprising (beings that neither are brilliant actors) as well as very welcomed.  This is not the best performance by either star (look at Monroe in `Some Like It Hot' or Gable in `It Happened One Night' for that) but it is definitely at the top of their heap.  Monroe's early scenes convey a breathy sense of maturity that she often forgot to lend her vixens, and Gable has so much natural girth that you just can't help but see him as a real man, no actorly symptoms in sight.  The deaths of both actors (which came very shortly after this film was released) is a sad yet poignant facet of the film.  When one watches the film with the knowledge of the eventual demise of the stars we can see a layer of profound realism in the character's desperate plea for some sort of purpose.It makes so much sense.As good as the leads were, the supporting cast is even better.  Eli Wallach delivers one of my favorite supporting performances of all time as Guido, the lovelorn pilot who fails to impress Roslyn as much as he hoped to.  His dire need for a woman's touch is so stunningly conveyed that he takes the cake as the most impressive performer in the cast (it's no wonder Monroe wanted his scenes shorted so that he wouldn't steal her limelight).  Thelma Ritter is also stunningly capable of carrying her scenes, with a spunk and cheery light that emanates and illuminates.  Montgomery Clift really excels in the films final scenes, where his moral dilemmas are made prominent.  It's a beautifully complete performance.But, where there is good there is also some bad.  My biggest issue with `The Misfits' is that there is a huge chunk of film in the middle of the movie that just doesn't fit right.  The beginning is spot on and really engaging, and the ending is nothing short of stunning (that final conversation between Monroe and Wallach is just brilliant) but the middle, that budding romance, is just awkward and unnecessary.  It just doesn't hold up and I found my interest fading.  John Huston is a very capable director (see `Fat City' RIGHT NOW) but he loses his reigns on this one a bit and delivers a less than perfect final product.

It concerns four very troubled and lonely individuals.G&aacute;y (Gable) is an aging rodeo roper who hates the idea of working for wages. He and small plane pilot Guido (Wallach) eke out a living catching the few wild mustangs that still roam Nevada's mountains to sell them for dog food at 6 a pound. Guido's wife is dead, G&aacute;y's left him and took their two kids.Pierce (Clift) is an accident-prone rodeo rider with a huge drinking problem. He's haunted by memories of seeing his dad accidentally killed by a hunter. Roslyn (Monroe) is a club dancer and new divorc&eacute;e who falls for the much older G&aacute;y. She happily fits right in with his little group, unaware of their cruel horse huntng tactics. Seeing for herself what rounding up entails, Roslyn first tries interfering, then offers to pay for the animals' freedom.THE FAMOUS ""CURSE""Clark Gable died of a coronary two months before this film hit theaters. It's been said the hard physical labor required in THE MISFITS may have hastened his death. Marilyn Monroe followed Gable to the grave in mid-1962 of an apparent suicide or accidental OD. Monty Clift's demise came from heart disease in '66, after too many years of drug and alcohol abuse. He was 45. By contrast, the fourth member of their unlucky quartet, Eli Wallach, was frail but still acting a half century later, at age 94.Another ""Misfits"" player, 58-year-old 'B' westerner Rex Bell, succumbed to a heart attack in 1962 while campaigning for Nevada governor.

Under the incredible messages that splash before the screen, it's perhaps one of the greatest love stories Hollywood ever produced.  It's a special love story.  Why?  Because it refuses to ignore the baggage that all relationships are straddled with: desperation, fear, cruelty, loneliness, nurturing, longing for love, longing to lose oneself.  The true Western virtue that desperately conflicts with the dispassionate 20th Century America.  The characters of Clarke Gable, Montgomery Cliff, and Eli Wallach clash with modern society to earn and obtain their own sense of independence.  The wild card in the mix is Marilyn Monroe, a compassionate and loving woman who is more than ready to love without recompense, without conditions.  Despite the passion for purpose, from bronco busting to drinking bouts, these men and women finds themselves standing against a world that wishes to reduce them into clogs.  And not just pitting against a conformed society but against each other as well, trying to burn away the self-imposed crucible of their own making.

And it can't be other way - the actors involved, the brilliant writer (Arthur Miller), the legendary director (John Huston), plus the set of circumstances at the time provided the ingredients for a remarkable and unforgettable film, and ""The Misfits"" certainly is. And now, with its Blu-ray edition, the fans and younger generations can enjoy this jewel as never before.Monroe plays Roslyn Taber, an attractive blonde that is finalizing her divorce from Raymond (Kevin MacCarthy). One day, her car needs some body work, and she and her friend Isabelle (Thelma Ritter) meet Guido (Eli Wallach), who will do the repairs of the vehicle. In turn, he introduces them to Gay Langland (Clark Gable). Gay is an old cowboy that wants to go back to the countryside - if there is such a thing in Reno, where the story takes place --, and invites Roslyn and Thelma to go with him, in order that Roslyn can take some stress off from her divorce. They all go, including Guido, to Guido's house in the desert - he used to live there with his wife until she died. Once there, Roslyn begins to enjoy herself, and Gay invites her to stay with him in the house for a while. She accepts and eventually falls in love with Gay. One day, Guido and Thelma visit them and together they decide to go to the rodeo, where Gay and Guido meet Perce Howland (Montgomery Clift), an old friend from the good old days. After some partying, Gay, Guido, and Perce decide to go ""mustanging,"" that is, capture wild horses, known as mustangs. They invite Roslyn, and she reluctantly accepts. Once there, she learns that all the captured mustangs would be sold, to later be slaughtered, to make dog food. Roslyn, being a good soul, is disturbed by this, and manifests her discomfort to Gay, who basically ignores her. This situation will create tension, which in turn reveals the real nature of some of the protagonists.As mentioned earlier, ""The Misfits"" was the last complete film that Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe did in their lives. Montgomery Clift didn't last that longer, too, as his problems were consuming him during that period. Monroe, who at the time was married to Miller, and for whom the writer wrote her role in the film, looked astonishing, and you can notice that the camera loved her. Huston really took out the best in them, and the acting is superb - a great farewell for three great actors.

B Collins Jr.,"[8, 9]","Superb in every sense, this film is a masterpiece, growing better with distance from the actual life dramas of the actors who perform so well here.I rate this film as a five star film based on the outstanding performances of the cast, the steady minimal visual foundation developed by the director, the penetrating script, and the fascinating message or theme of the film.Monroe is super as the fragile, feminine, idealistic Roslyn Tabor. We learn that her sensitive soft nature has had multiple blows in the world of male dominated reality. Yet she holds her ground. She holds it so well that she becomes the transformative figure in the lives of three men. Gable gets an A plus for this performance of the aged knight, weary from the battle but so familiar with the rules of the game that he is somewhat reluctant to begin a game with new rules. Roslyn offers a completely new game in which he is not in control, a challenge he eventually accepts. Montgomery Cliff plays Perce Howland, a young broken man. He is broken in heart and spirit engaged in a rough trade of rodeo work that breaks his body to match his soul. Eli Wallach plays Guido, that thinks he can move toward meaning in his life if he possesses the girl rather than transforming his life by incorperating the femine principle into his existence. Thelma Ritter is super as Isabell Steers, a character that has learned how to limit her expectations and to even celebrate defeats.John Houston uses stark minimal sets which help focus the attention onto the actors and their interactions and struggles. The narrative and visual flow are excellent and coordinated with high impact. Arthur Miller's script is under appreciated in my opinion. It is an actor's delight to have such intense and insightful poetic language, made even more interesting coming from human misfits in the desert.Miller taps into a theme of great psychological importance in this film, which is the transfoming of the masculine by the feminine. Monroe plays this perfectly as her beauty which is sometimes her curse, is a blessing for those men who try to grow and incorporate the feminine principle. Cliff is healed by this force, Wallach tries to overpower the force with the force of the masculine, but it is Gable who has experienced a world of pain that then allows him to fully integrate the feminine into his character, opening him up to a new world of experience and insight. In this sense the film is very Jungian for the path of pure masculinity is limited and eventually destructive, as the three men in this film reveal. Ritter says they are the 'only real men left and as dependable as jack rabbits.'In the end, the work is a masterpiece in every respect.",5,The triumph of the feminine,1183766400,"07 7, 2007",2007,2703,"['Superb', 'sense', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'growing', 'better', 'distance', 'actual', 'life', 'dramas', 'actors', 'who', 'perform', 'so', 'well', 'here.I', 'rate', 'film', 'five', 'star', 'film', 'based', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'cast', 'steady', 'minimal', 'visual', 'foundation', 'developed', 'director', 'penetrating', 'script', 'fascinating', 'message', 'theme', 'film.Monroe', 'super', 'fragile', 'feminine', 'idealistic', 'Roslyn', 'Tabor', 'learn', 'sensitive', 'soft', 'nature', 'had', 'multiple', 'blows', 'world', 'male', 'dominated', 'reality', 'ground', 'so', 'well', 'transformative', 'figure', 'lives', 'three', 'men', 'Gable', 'A', 'plus', 'performance', 'aged', 'knight', 'weary', 'battle', 'so', 'familiar', 'rules', 'game', 'somewhat', 'reluctant', 'begin', 'game', 'new', 'rules', 'Roslyn', 'completely', 'new', 'game', 'not', 'control', 'challenge', 'eventually', 'Montgomery', 'Cliff', 'Perce', 'Howland', 'young', 'broken', 'man', 'broken', 'heart', 'spirit', 'engaged', 'rough', 'trade', 'rodeo', 'work', 'body', 'match', 'soul', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'Guido', 'can', 'move', 'meaning', 'life', 'girl', 'rather', 'transforming', 'life', 'incorperating', 'femine', 'principle', 'existence', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'super', 'Isabell', 'Steers', 'character', 'learned', 'how', 'limit', 'expectations', 'even', 'celebrate', 'defeats.John', 'Houston', 'stark', 'minimal', 'sets', 'help', 'focus', 'attention', 'actors', 'interactions', 'struggles', 'narrative', 'visual', 'flow', 'are', 'excellent', 'coordinated', 'high', 'impact', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'script', 'appreciated', 'opinion', 'actor', 'delight', 'have', 'such', 'intense', 'insightful', 'poetic', 'language', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'coming', 'human', 'misfits', 'desert.Miller', 'theme', 'great', 'psychological', 'importance', 'film', 'transfoming', 'masculine', 'feminine', 'Monroe', 'perfectly', 'beauty', 'sometimes', 'curse', 'blessing', 'men', 'who', 'try', 'grow', 'incorporate', 'feminine', 'principle', 'Cliff', 'healed', 'force', 'Wallach', 'overpower', 'force', 'force', 'masculine', 'Gable', 'who', 'experienced', 'world', 'pain', 'then', 'fully', 'integrate', 'feminine', 'character', 'opening', 'up', 'new', 'world', 'experience', 'insight', 'sense', 'film', 'very', 'Jungian', 'path', 'pure', 'masculinity', 'limited', 'eventually', 'destructive', 'three', 'men', 'film', 'reveal', 'Ritter', 'are', ""'only"", 'real', 'men', 'left', 'as', 'dependable', 'jack', 'rabbits', 'end', 'work', 'masterpiece', 'respect']",Misfits VHS

398818,A3N95R1VKWROWF,6304056877,Christopher Schwinger,"[1, 2]","This movie is famous for being the last movie Clark Gable did and the last movie Marilyn Monroe did, before each had unexpected deaths, and Montgomery Clift's personal decline soon followed.  I think the reason I don't recommend this movie is because it has such palpable sadness in its outlook on life.  Clark Gable is a rodeo performer, and he also works with Eli Wallach to round up horses to send them to be made into dog food.  They and Montgomery Clift befriend a lonely Marilyn Monroe character and they do some outings together and discuss some weighty issues of life.  One thing that makes it so sad is that Monroe's real-life pain shows in her performance.  She seems so broken, which indeed she was.  Some may say that this authenticity makes it a great performance, but I'm not talking about whether she plays her part well; I'm just saying it's a sad character to be the main focus of the story, and her character made it unenjoyable for me.  There's an ultra-Romantic sense of individualism in the movie that feels kind of lonely, like the characters don't feel a sense of community in the inhumane world around them.  The Eli Wallach character is likable but eventually becomes the worldly voice who wants to keep doing business as usual, rounding up horses to be made into dog food.  Clark Gable succumbs to Marilyn Monroe's idealism and decides to abandon such an inhumane profession, and they drive off with romantic starlight.It's got a lot of melancholy and requires a level of emotional engagement which I don't like to give for a theme as simple as ""care for the animals around you"".  Clark Gable's acting, while more worked-up than he typically is, didn't seem remarkable to me in the sense of a revolutionary new approach he took to acting.  He was attempting to be a ""Method actor"" in this role, in the presence of Method actors Clift, Monroe, and Wallach.  You can call me simple, but it seems to me that ""Method acting"" requires mainly that you make up some backstory to your character to project psychological disturbance in your performance.  I'm only mentioning this to say Gable's acting is not enough of an attraction in this to make it worth the while.  If you have interest in seeing his last role and Marilyn Monroe's last role, go ahead, but the movie doesn't offer anything remarkable from a thematic, cinematic (camerawork), or acting standpoint--and is fairly sad.",3,"Is of interest if you want to see their last roles, but is fairly sad and offers nothing to sufficiently compensate for the mood",1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,2403,"['movie', 'famous', 'being', 'last', 'movie', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'did', 'last', 'movie', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'did', 'had', 'unexpected', 'deaths', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'personal', 'decline', 'soon', 'followed', 'think', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'such', 'palpable', 'sadness', 'outlook', 'life', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'rodeo', 'performer', 'also', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'round', 'up', 'horses', 'send', 'be', 'made', 'dog', 'food', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'befriend', 'lonely', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'character', 'do', 'outings', 'together', 'discuss', 'weighty', 'issues', 'life', 'One', 'thing', 'so', 'sad', 'Monroe', 'real-life', 'pain', 'shows', 'performance', 'so', 'broken', 'indeed', 'was', 'may', 'say', 'authenticity', 'great', 'performance', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'part', 'well', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'sad', 'character', 'be', 'main', 'focus', 'story', 'character', 'made', 'unenjoyable', 'ultra-Romantic', 'sense', 'individualism', 'movie', 'kind', 'lonely', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sense', 'community', 'inhumane', 'world', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'character', 'likable', 'eventually', 'worldly', 'voice', 'who', 'keep', 'doing', 'business', 'usual', 'rounding', 'up', 'horses', 'be', 'made', 'dog', 'food', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'succumbs', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'idealism', 'decides', 'abandon', 'such', 'inhumane', 'profession', 'drive', 'off', 'romantic', 'starlight.It', 'got', 'lot', 'melancholy', 'level', 'emotional', 'engagement', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'give', 'theme', 'as', 'simple', 'care', 'animals', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'acting', 'more', 'worked-up', 'typically', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'remarkable', 'sense', 'revolutionary', 'new', 'approach', 'took', 'acting', 'was', 'attempting', 'be', 'Method', 'actor', 'role', 'presence', 'Method', 'actors', 'Clift', 'Monroe', 'Wallach', 'can', 'call', 'simple', 'Method', 'acting', 'mainly', 'make', 'up', 'backstory', 'character', 'project', 'psychological', 'disturbance', 'performance', ""'m"", 'only', 'mentioning', 'say', 'Gable', 'acting', 'not', 'enough', 'attraction', 'make', 'while', 'have', 'interest', 'seeing', 'last', 'role', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'last', 'role', 'go', 'ahead', 'movie', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'remarkable', 'thematic', 'cinematic', 'camerawork', 'acting', 'standpoint', 'fairly', 'sad']",Misfits VHS

And her character has nothing to do with the talented actress.  It's the truth but it is SO unpleasant that I don't want to see it again. However, I do want to read Marilyn Monroe's lines in her scene with Eli Wallach when he propositions her to save the Mustangs.This movie should put anyone off of pet ownership.  It's a business scam like greeting card holidays.  Who would choose owning a pet over the life of a wild horse?Marilyn Monroe, Chicagoite finds herself in the land of the marginalized, the failures, losers, the fearful narcissists afraid to see their reflection in comparison to others.  Clark Butler in an amazing bout face does an impersonation of his own suave glib style but his character is all surface effort barely concealing an angry fearful male past his prime drooling and surprised at the amazing good fortune to have a fresh piece of sugar cane dropped into the wasteland of his useless life.  Usually, he vengefully toys with the newly divorced passing through Reno but really he can't leave with any of them and work for ""wages"" because he can't handle the risk of anyone seeing him fail or being corrected as he is bound to make mistakes.Eli Wallach (poor Eli Wallach) is just selfish and practiced in reciting the press release of himself - the left behind widower and war veteran - Marilyn Monroe's outburst about what she sees about his true colors is the best thing about this movie and takes place near the end of the movie.  I really feared for her safety as her wary character must have as well for she then calls the three ""sweet dear dead men"" the first two flattering adjectives meant to soothe them and keep her safe from immediate threat.It was easy and advisable to ignore all the hype about her unattractiveness and the drama on set that marred this production. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie but it is strong meat - more so than similar Tenessee Williams based classic Hollywood movies.Everyone's projecting what they need Marilyn Monroe's character to be but she isn't that damaged just trying to be a little boat navigating through all types of water no matter how seemingly harmless so as to not overturn and that is how Marilyn Monroe's character handles Thelma Ritter's tagalong female who holds no sexual interest to any of the three men and knows it.  But she's SO lonely that she insists on being a presence until something more nourishing appears and Marilyn Monroe's character is careful to not leave her out.MM's character thoughout the film juggles everything.  She probably wishes she could have just gotten onto a plane out of Reno when her business there was done but Thelma Ritter's character had glommed onto her at the outset and walked her through her divorce.Marilyn Monroe's character shows an astute and cautious personality that takes no risk of offending anyone as if she had endured a previous life in the midst of menace.Clark Gable's character as do the other men tries to find some leverage over finally settling on the perception that she must have been a stripper back in Chicago. That's where the misfits moniker of the film comes from - he uses that as an excuse for taking out the horses for six cents a pound and tries to make Marilyn believe that about herself to make her stay and to excuse his own refusal to work for ""wages.""  No one in this film is a misfit or an aspberger, the Reno residents are losers, damaged goods usually by their own personality flaws and Marilyn is overqualified for the place and too polite to call anyone on their shortcomings so they think she must be broken (like them) for sticking around.What this movie is has nothing to do with all the hype and negative gossip about it.",5,Incredible character study and portrayals by megatalents of Hollywood.,1315958400,"09 14, 2011",2011,3796,"['Wow', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'did', 'good', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'even', 'married', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'character', 'nothing', 'do', 'talented', 'actress', 'truth', 'SO', 'unpleasant', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'again', 'However', 'do', 'want', 'read', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'lines', 'scene', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'when', 'save', 'Mustangs.This', 'movie', 'should', 'put', 'anyone', 'pet', 'ownership', 'business', 'scam', 'greeting', 'card', 'holidays', 'Who', 'would', 'choose', 'owning', 'pet', 'life', 'wild', 'horse', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Chicagoite', 'land', 'marginalized', 'failures', 'losers', 'fearful', 'narcissists', 'afraid', 'see', 'reflection', 'comparison', 'others', 'Clark', 'Butler', 'amazing', 'bout', 'face', 'impersonation', 'own', 'suave', 'glib', 'style', 'character', 'surface', 'effort', 'barely', 'concealing', 'angry', 'fearful', 'male', 'prime', 'drooling', 'surprised', 'amazing', 'good', 'fortune', 'have', 'fresh', 'piece', 'sugar', 'cane', 'dropped', 'wasteland', 'useless', 'life', 'Usually', 'vengefully', 'newly', 'divorced', 'passing', 'Reno', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'work', 'wages', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'risk', 'anyone', 'seeing', 'fail', 'being', 'corrected', 'bound', 'make', 'mistakes.Eli', 'Wallach', 'poor', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'just', 'selfish', 'practiced', 'reciting', 'press', 'release', 'left', 'widower', 'war', 'veteran', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'outburst', 'what', 'true', 'colors', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'place', 'end', 'movie', 'really', 'feared', 'safety', 'wary', 'character', 'must', 'have', 'as', 'well', 'then', 'three', 'sweet', 'dear', 'dead', 'men', 'first', 'two', 'flattering', 'adjectives', 'meant', 'soothe', 'keep', 'safe', 'immediate', 'threat.It', 'was', 'easy', 'advisable', 'ignore', 'hype', 'unattractiveness', 'drama', 'set', 'marred', 'production', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'movie', 'strong', 'meat', 'more', 'so', 'similar', 'Tenessee', 'Williams', 'based', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'movies.Everyone', 'projecting', 'what', 'need', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'character', 'be', ""n't"", 'damaged', 'just', 'trying', 'be', 'little', 'boat', 'navigating', 'types', 'water', 'matter', 'how', 'seemingly', 'harmless', 'so', 'not', 'overturn', 'how', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'character', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'tagalong', 'female', 'who', 'sexual', 'interest', 'three', 'men', 'SO', 'lonely', 'being', 'presence', 'something', 'more', 'nourishing', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'character', 'careful', 'not', 'leave', 'out.MM', 'character', 'film', 'juggles', 'everything', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'gotten', 'onto', 'plane', 'Reno', 'when', 'business', 'was', 'done', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'character', 'had', 'glommed', 'outset', 'walked', 'divorce.Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'character', 'astute', 'cautious', 'personality', 'risk', 'offending', 'anyone', 'had', 'endured', 'previous', 'life', 'midst', 'menace.Clark', 'Gable', 'character', 'do', 'other', 'men', 'tries', 'find', 'leverage', 'finally', 'settling', 'perception', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'stripper', 'back', 'Chicago', 'where', 'misfits', 'moniker', 'film', 'excuse', 'taking', 'out', 'horses', 'six', 'cents', 'pound', 'tries', 'make', 'Marilyn', 'believe', 'about', 'make', 'stay', 'excuse', 'own', 'refusal', 'work', 'wages', 'one', 'film', 'misfit', 'aspberger', 'Reno', 'residents', 'are', 'losers', 'damaged', 'goods', 'usually', 'own', 'personality', 'flaws', 'Marilyn', 'overqualified', 'place', 'too', 'polite', 'call', 'anyone', 'shortcomings', 'think', 'must', 'be', 'broken', 'sticking', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'hype', 'negative', 'gossip']",Misfits VHS

Gable, an aged drunken cowboy and Wallach, a mechanic and airplane pilot start partying with the girls.  They wind up in Wallach's partially finished house in the desert.One thing leads to another and Gable and Monroe wind up keeping company in the house.  Monroe, a naive idealist is wooed by Gable's old west rap about freedom and the wide open spaces.  They commence a hard to believe relationship much to the chagrin of the neurotic Wallach who is also bewitched by the gorgeous Monroe.Gable and Wallach plan to go out into the desert to round up some wild mustangs which they will capture and sell for meat.  They need a third hand and recruit rodeo cowboy Perce Howland played by Montgomery Clift.  Clift also has issues.  He was a one time momma's boy who had his birthwright stolen by his step father after his widowed mother remarried.  All 3 men are drawn to Monroe like a moth to a beacon.  They are all in love with her and worship her for her alleged knowledge of the true meaning of life.This disturbing flick culiminates when the 3 guys and Monroe go out into the desert to round up the wild mustangs.  The ironic capture of the mustangs which symbolize the freedom espoused by Gable aptly points out the hypocrisy of Gable's existence.  His freedom is funded by the robbing of the freedom of the wild horses.  Monroe is appalled by the round up and the men eventually let them go to appease her, selling out their beliefs. This act symbolically puts an end to Gable's cowboy existence so that he and Monroe can continue together",4,An improbable May-September relationship,1119484800,"06 23, 2005",2005,2281,"['John', 'Huston', 'Misfits', 'tale', 'group', 'unlikeable', 'confused', 'troubled', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'thrown', 'together', 'form', 'unfathomable', 'relationships', 'story', 'written', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'expectedly', 'filled', 'symbolism', 'Misfits', 'actually', 'term', 'used', 'describe', 'wild', 'mustangs', 'roaming', 'ranges', 'West', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'used', 'describe', 'cast', 'characters', 'film.The', 'curvaceous', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'playing', 'Roslyn', 'Taber', 'Reno', 'get', 'divorced', 'Monroe', 'product', 'loveless', 'childhood', 'marriage', 'being', 'accompanied', 'landlady', 'Isabelle', 'played', 'marvelously', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'meet', 'Guido', 'Gay', 'played', 'respectively', 'talented', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'haggard', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Gable', 'aged', 'drunken', 'cowboy', 'Wallach', 'mechanic', 'airplane', 'pilot', 'start', 'partying', 'girls', 'wind', 'up', 'Wallach', 'partially', 'finished', 'house', 'desert.One', 'thing', 'Gable', 'Monroe', 'wind', 'up', 'keeping', 'company', 'house', 'Monroe', 'naive', 'idealist', 'wooed', 'Gable', 'old', 'west', 'rap', 'freedom', 'wide', 'open', 'spaces', 'commence', 'hard', 'believe', 'relationship', 'much', 'chagrin', 'neurotic', 'Wallach', 'who', 'also', 'bewitched', 'gorgeous', 'Monroe.Gable', 'Wallach', 'plan', 'go', 'out', 'desert', 'round', 'up', 'wild', 'mustangs', 'will', 'capture', 'sell', 'meat', 'need', 'third', 'hand', 'recruit', 'rodeo', 'cowboy', 'Perce', 'Howland', 'played', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Clift', 'also', 'issues', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'momma', 'boy', 'who', 'had', 'birthwright', 'stolen', 'step', 'father', 'widowed', 'mother', 'remarried', '3', 'men', 'are', 'drawn', 'Monroe', 'moth', 'beacon', 'are', 'love', 'worship', 'alleged', 'knowledge', 'true', 'meaning', 'life.This', 'disturbing', 'flick', 'culiminates', 'when', '3', 'guys', 'Monroe', 'go', 'out', 'desert', 'round', 'up', 'wild', 'mustangs', 'ironic', 'capture', 'mustangs', 'symbolize', 'freedom', 'espoused', 'Gable', 'aptly', 'out', 'hypocrisy', 'Gable', 'existence', 'freedom', 'funded', 'robbing', 'freedom', 'wild', 'horses', 'Monroe', 'appalled', 'round', 'up', 'men', 'eventually', 'let', 'go', 'appease', 'selling', 'out', 'beliefs', 'act', 'symbolically', 'end', 'Gable', 'cowboy', 'existence', 'so', 'Monroe', 'can', 'continue', 'together']",Misfits VHS

Essentially, it's a very self-consciously deliberate attempt at a &#34;deep&#34;, poetic and unconventionally plotted--even &#34;experimental&#34;--examination of people, relationships, the soul, etc etc--maybe just say &#34;European&#34; to sum it up. Not a bad premise for an alternative to the standard Hollywood servings of the time.But...we have Arthur Miller's celebrated ear for dialogue in full tin clank--in no other movie have I disliked Thelma Ritter, but even that no-nonsense actress' best attempts cannot overcome the high-flown mawkishness of the lines she is forced to speak. Gable is actually very good, especially in his drunk scene when he yells for his children. But his performance, and the gravity of his presence, are undermined by the over-explicit, pseudo-meaningful things he is given to say, about Monroe and her wonderfulness, about life, about whatever it is he keeps babbling about, when everything we see about his character and the way Gable plays him tell us this man wouldn't talk like this--or at least not so MUCH.Clift is very, very good, and he has the best-written part; but Monroe--steady, worshippers!--is flat-out bad. One must give a good deal of the blame to the script; Miller writes her action, her lines and everyone's else's lines referring to her to make her into something non-material, ethereal and floaty, and it's hard to think of many actresses who could portray that, as fundamentally anti-dramatic (and uninvolved--a goddess/angel can dance mistily in the trees, but she's not part of the action) as that is, but a better one would have acted AGAINST this shimmery, formless conception, and Monroe can't or won't. Her voice sounds like an airy whistle petering out into fizzling silence, and she seems less spiritually shining than too awkwardly reticent to say or do anything that would threaten any kind of definiteness; it's hard to imagine her capable of getting through the most basic tasks of an everyday life, so far out in the ether is she presented. Of course, her big &#34;action&#34; moment is when she's trying to stop the roundup, screaming her rage in the flat desert, and while it is the only moment where her performance has any charge at all, all I could think of was these poor hardworking, tough cowboys, utterly bewildered and wondering why in the world they brought THIS hysterical nut along for the ride?Huston's direction suggests his bewilderment as well--a lot of it is visually striking and it's surprisingly well-paced, but he seems totally (and perhaps understandably) distant from the conflicts and psychology in the screenplay; and once more, we must give Miller his due measure of blame for what &#34;The Misfits&#34; is and isn't. One of his few gifts as a dramatist was for constructing plots with absorbing dramatic structures that illustrated his themes. His worst failing was always his utter lack of poetry, compounded by his incessant attempts to be poetic. In &#34;The Misfits&#34; he blithely abandons his plus in favor of his minus, and the result is pre-ordained.",2,The last shall not ALWAYS be first....,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,3186,"['Yes', 'Gable', 'last', 'film', 'Monroe', 'story', 'making', 'fascinating', 'what', 'actual', 'movie', 'Essentially', 'very', 'self-consciously', 'deliberate', 'attempt', '34', 'deep', '34', 'poetic', 'unconventionally', 'plotted', 'even', '34', 'experimental', '34', 'examination', 'people', 'relationships', 'soul', 'etc', 'etc', 'maybe', 'just', 'say', '34', 'European', '34', 'sum', 'up', 'Not', 'bad', 'premise', 'alternative', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'servings', 'time.But', 'have', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'celebrated', 'ear', 'dialogue', 'full', 'tin', 'clank', 'other', 'movie', 'have', 'disliked', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'even', 'no-nonsense', 'actress', 'best', 'attempts', 'can', 'not', 'overcome', 'high-flown', 'mawkishness', 'lines', 'forced', 'speak', 'Gable', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'drunk', 'scene', 'when', 'children', 'performance', 'gravity', 'presence', 'are', 'undermined', 'over-explicit', 'pseudo-meaningful', 'things', 'given', 'say', 'Monroe', 'wonderfulness', 'life', 'whatever', 'babbling', 'about', 'when', 'everything', 'see', 'character', 'way', 'Gable', 'tell', 'man', 'would', ""n't"", 'talk', 'least', 'not', 'so', 'MUCH.Clift', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'best-written', 'part', 'Monroe', 'steady', 'worshippers', 'flat-out', 'bad', 'One', 'must', 'give', 'good', 'deal', 'blame', 'script', 'Miller', 'action', 'lines', 'everyone', 'else', 'lines', 'referring', 'make', 'something', 'non-material', 'ethereal', 'floaty', 'hard', 'think', 'many', 'actresses', 'who', 'could', 'portray', 'that', 'fundamentally', 'anti-dramatic', 'uninvolved', 'goddess/angel', 'can', 'dance', 'mistily', 'trees', 'not', 'part', 'action', 'better', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'acted', 'AGAINST', 'shimmery', 'formless', 'conception', 'Monroe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'voice', 'sounds', 'airy', 'whistle', 'petering', 'out', 'fizzling', 'silence', 'less', 'spiritually', 'shining', 'too', 'awkwardly', 'reticent', 'say', 'do', 'anything', 'would', 'threaten', 'kind', 'definiteness', 'hard', 'imagine', 'capable', 'getting', 'most', 'basic', 'tasks', 'everyday', 'life', 'so', 'far', 'out', 'ether', 'presented', 'course', 'big', '34', 'action', '34', 'moment', 'when', 'trying', 'stop', 'roundup', 'screaming', 'rage', 'flat', 'desert', 'only', 'moment', 'where', 'performance', 'charge', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'poor', 'hardworking', 'tough', 'cowboys', 'utterly', 'bewildered', 'wondering', 'why', 'world', 'brought', 'THIS', 'hysterical', 'nut', 'ride', 'Huston', 'direction', 'bewilderment', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'visually', 'striking', 'surprisingly', 'well-paced', 'totally', 'perhaps', 'understandably', 'distant', 'conflicts', 'psychology', 'screenplay', 'once', 'more', 'must', 'give', 'Miller', 'due', 'measure', 'blame', 'what', '34', 'Misfits', '34', ""n't"", 'One', 'few', 'gifts', 'dramatist', 'was', 'constructing', 'plots', 'absorbing', 'dramatic', 'structures', 'illustrated', 'themes', 'worst', 'failing', 'was', 'always', 'utter', 'lack', 'poetry', 'compounded', 'incessant', 'attempts', 'be', 'poetic', '34', 'Misfits', '34', 'blithely', 'plus', 'favor', 'minus', 'result', 'pre-ordained']",Misfits VHS

398830,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6304056877,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 7]","If ever there was a movie that you would hope would be a masterpiece, especially given the pedigree of talent involved, it may very well be this one. Legends abound throughout the production both in front of and behind the camera. Directed by John Huston and written by Arthur Miller, this is a movie about the last of the cowboys in what apparently was the only frontier left in the early 1960's, the Sierra foothills of Nevada. The last gasp act for these desperate men is to rope wild mustangs from a speeding pick-up truck, so they can sell the carcasses for dog food. It's an intriguing, fragile premise, but the treatment here seems too vaunted. Starring three screen luminaries of towering magnitude - Clark Gable, Marilyn Monroe and Montgomery Clift, the film falls short of its lofty ambitions but not for lack of trying. There are isolated moments of great power and poignancy, but the core problem is really Miller's ponderous and rather misguided script, full of pretentious soliloquies that may work for Willy Loman but not for characters who are supposed to be inarticulate by their very nature. The net result is that you rather feel sorry for the actors as they put in a valiant effort to transcend the material. Miller wrote the screenplay expressly for his then-wife as their marriage was falling apart, and it's a miracle that Monroe ended up with a solid role that capitalized on her strengths given that his post-mortem tribute to her, ""After the Fall"" is a scathing indictment of her memory. But above all else, there is a morbid cloud that seems to darken the tone of the film, and one wonders if Huston was responding to the fragile state of the actors involved.In what turned out to be her last completed film, Monroe extends on the promise she showed in ""Bus Stop"" five years earlier. Still stunning with an unbelievable magnetism, she was growing into a highly instinctive actress capable of conveying deeply felt emotions. With the combination of her beauty and vulnerability acting as the elusive flame around which the three men hover, Monroe uses her childlike innocence and unexpected wisdom to make her forlorn divorcee, Rosalyn, a more fully dimensional woman than she probably was on paper. It is one of the very rare occasions when she is the emotional center of the story, and she is particularly effective in reaction shots when she lets her eyes express her emotions for her. Her climactic banshee cry about the cowboys being murderers is a startling moment and a sad glimpse into what a wonderful actress she could have been given the right roles. In his valedictory role as well, Gable still has the old Hollywood star wattage and natural machismo to bring credibility to his aged cowboy, Gay, showing unexpected sensitivity in some difficult scenes. He lets the sadness come through his smiling eyes as he begins to realize his rugged lifestyle is quickly disappearing, the prospect of ""wages"" growing near and that everything he values is running off with the horses. Perhaps Gable was inspired by his Actors' Studio colleagues to trust his instinct in exposing his vulnerability, but it does backfire badly during his extended drunken scenes where it is discomforting to watch him overact with such broad strokes. It's also painful to see him wrangle the wild mustangs at the end with the knowledge of his looming death, but credit is due him for bringing authenticity to these challenging scenes. Clift, probably as much an acting polar opposite for Gable as he was for John Wayne in ""Red River"", is quite touching in the smallish role of Perce, the cowboy with the most open-hearted infatuation with Rosalyn. Poor Eli Wallach is saddled with probably the most contrived lines of Miller's script and the least sympathetic character, a mouthy braggart who is the first to meet Rosalyn and then suffers the humiliation of witnessing her growing attraction to Gay.

In point of fact it is famous really only for that. A terrible, stoned-looking Monroe slurs and stumbles her way through the part of a world-weary young lady looking for peace and quiet in a small Nevada town. Let me warn all Monroe fans: this is not merely 'great acting' on her part. She looks bad, like a drunk druggie on a relatively good day. Point is, you'll notice it and it will not be pretty to see.As I say, that is not acting - that's real trouble. Perhaps Huston was taking advantage.Gable is one of those big, dopey sweet old-fashioned cowboy types, looking for love and missing his kids. They make a heck of a pair, and I marveled at the fact that the characters might have made it work in real life. This aimless, pointless movie sort of follows Monroe around as she follows Gable around, the story, location and acting: all bleak. I wondered when Huston was going to reveal this was film noir - but of course, that is absurd.The value of seeing Gable and Monroe in such serious, unique roles may be some negligible inducement to see this; I can't say. Personally, I can live without either of them. Though I warn you: if you are sensitive about such things, as I indeed am, you will weep at the sight of Monroe and then weep more when you recall that she will be dead within a short time of wrapping this movie.The great Thelma Ritter and my personal favorite Eli Wallach round out the weird cast of characters. The immortal Estelle Winwood's cameo is all the more strange for its incredible humor.Otherwise, I can find precious little to recommend this thing. I notice many new films - things by the Coen Brothers and so forth - seem to be made in this mould. Mostly it is a genre I despise: early-1960s-pointless-angst. Anything else may be seen as Huston homage. Knowing that there were reasons to have angst in the early 1960s doesn't mean anyone ever really wanted to see films about it.Any day, any, give me a cheery Monroe as inGentlemen Prefer Blondes. The two stars I gave MISFITS are strictly for Monroe and Gable. Let me say: merely a semi-legendary director and several huge stars do not a masterpiece make.

398835,A2HIWDD2TDXS19,6304056877,F. Gentile,"[158, 165]","It's almost impossible to review this as just a movie, as it is, to movie buffs at least, such a curio piece. As everyone knows, the screenplay, written by Arthur Miller, started out as a tribute to his wife, Marilyn Monroe, but proved to be the death knell for their marriage. Though this looks like a ""Western"", it is far from it. It is an almost obscene look into the coming together of a group of lost souls who have nothing left to lose. This John Houston film was famously fraught with problems, many related to M.M.'s real life breakdown, and went over budget, and became, at that time, the most expensive black & white film to date, a dubious distinction. That Miller based ""Roslyn"" on Marilyn is now well known, a portrait at once flattering and brutally honest. If there's any doubt that Roslyn is M.M., watch for the scene when Marilyn opens a locker , in she & Clarks little ""love cottage"", there are well known glamour pin-ups  of the real life Marilyn hung inside, which ""Roslyn"" refers to as ""just some old pictures of me."" Also the scene of M.M. & Gable, as they awaken one morning, and she is seen nude from the back, is one Marilyn fought for, wanting  her breast, which was visible in the rushes, kept in the final film. This was unheard of at that time, and was cut out of the final print. At the time, M.M. commented: ""I love to do things the censors won't pass, after all, what are we here for, just to stand around and let it pass us by?... Gradually, they'll let down the censorship, sadly, probably not in my lifetime "",  a prophetic comment from a woman who was ahead of her time. Though she drove John Houston to distraction during the filming, he years later commented: ""Marilyn was as fine an actress as any I ever worked with... she just reached down within herself and pulled her own emotions  out, it was real.""  This film , aside from Clark Gable, also stars good M.M. friend Montgomery Clift, another real life misfit, also good M.M. friend Eli Wallach, both fellow alumni of The Actors Studio, and the fabulous Thelma Ritter, who seems to be the only one capable of holding it together. At the films release, during Marilyns now famous scene in the desert, where she lashes out at the brutality of  ""the men""  as they capture a horse for slaughter, apparently many in the theatres laughed out loud at this unacceptable version of their Marilyn, which is very sad. I have always found this scene devestating, and only shows the struggle she had to face, in her attempts to grow as an actress, and not be confined by peoples limited vision of her. Contrary to popular belief, this film was not a total artistic failure, and received many positive reviews at it's opening. The New York Tribune: ""Here Miss Monroe is magic but not a living pin-up dangled in skin tight satin, and can anyone deny that in this film, these performers are at their best?""  New York Daily News: ""Gable has never done anything better on screen, nor has Miss Monroe."" The fact that Gable died two weeks after shooting wrapped, and that Marilyn never completed another film, only seals the legend surrounding this films making. In hindsight, it was truly  the end of an era. If you want a fascinating read on the making of this film, try and get the long out of print ""The Story Of The Misfits"", by James Goode. Published in 1963, it's a  day by day chronicle of the films making, and, though only a year after M.M.'s tragic death, handles her memory with total respect...the legend had already begun. This sad, but ultimatley hope filled little drama, filmed in the almost lifeless desert, is maybe not for the viewer looking for lots of excitement and action. But if you're a serious viewer who can appreciate brilliantly subtle performances, starring two of filmdoms biggest legends... in a movie steeped in Hollywood folklore, then you'll appreciate this film. How fitting that their final scene has them riding off, heading ""for that big star.""",5,Twilight Of The Gods.,1024617600,"06 21, 2002",2002,3956,"['almost', 'impossible', 'review', 'just', 'movie', 'movie', 'buffs', 'least', 'such', 'curio', 'piece', 'everyone', 'screenplay', 'written', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'started', 'out', 'tribute', 'wife', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'proved', 'be', 'death', 'knell', 'marriage', 'Western', 'far', 'almost', 'obscene', 'look', 'coming', 'together', 'group', 'lost', 'souls', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'left', 'lose', 'John', 'Houston', 'film', 'was', 'famously', 'fraught', 'problems', 'many', 'related', 'M.M', 'real', 'life', 'breakdown', 'went', 'budget', 'became', 'time', 'most', 'expensive', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'date', 'dubious', 'distinction', 'Miller', 'based', 'Roslyn', 'Marilyn', 'now', 'well', 'known', 'portrait', 'once', 'flattering', 'brutally', 'honest', 'doubt', 'Roslyn', 'M.M.', 'watch', 'scene', 'when', 'Marilyn', 'locker', 'Clarks', 'little', 'love', 'cottage', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'glamour', 'pin-ups', 'real', 'life', 'Marilyn', 'hung', 'inside', 'Roslyn', 'refers', 'just', 'old', 'pictures', 'Also', 'scene', 'M.M', 'Gable', 'awaken', 'one', 'morning', 'seen', 'nude', 'back', 'one', 'Marilyn', 'fought', 'wanting', 'breast', 'was', 'visible', 'rushes', 'kept', 'final', 'film', 'was', 'unheard', 'time', 'was', 'cut', 'final', 'print', 'time', 'M.M', 'commented', 'love', 'do', 'things', 'censors', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pass', 'what', 'are', 'here', 'just', 'stand', 'let', 'pass', 'Gradually', ""'ll"", 'let', 'down', 'censorship', 'sadly', 'probably', 'not', 'lifetime', 'prophetic', 'comment', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'drove', 'John', 'Houston', 'distraction', 'filming', 'years', 'later', 'commented', 'Marilyn', 'was', 'fine', 'actress', 'ever', 'worked', 'just', 'reached', 'down', 'pulled', 'own', 'emotions', 'out', 'was', 'real', 'film', 'aside', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'also', 'good', 'M.M', 'friend', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'real', 'life', 'misfit', 'also', 'good', 'M.M', 'friend', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'fellow', 'alumni', 'Actors', 'Studio', 'fabulous', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'who', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'capable', 'holding', 'together', 'films', 'release', 'Marilyns', 'now', 'famous', 'scene', 'desert', 'where', 'out', 'brutality', 'men', 'capture', 'horse', 'slaughter', 'apparently', 'many', 'theatres', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'unacceptable', 'version', 'Marilyn', 'very', 'sad', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'scene', 'devestating', 'only', 'struggle', 'had', 'face', 'attempts', 'grow', 'actress', 'not', 'be', 'confined', 'peoples', 'limited', 'vision', 'Contrary', 'popular', 'belief', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'total', 'artistic', 'failure', 'received', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'opening', 'New', 'York', 'Tribune', 'Here', 'Miss', 'Monroe', 'magic', 'not', 'living', 'pin-up', 'dangled', 'skin', 'tight', 'satin', 'can', 'anyone', 'deny', 'film', 'performers', 'are', 'best', 'New', 'York', 'Daily', 'News', 'Gable', 'never', 'done', 'anything', 'better', 'screen', 'Miss', 'Monroe', 'fact', 'Gable', 'died', 'two', 'weeks', 'shooting', 'wrapped', 'Marilyn', 'never', 'completed', 'film', 'only', 'legend', 'surrounding', 'films', 'making', 'hindsight', 'was', 'truly', 'end', 'era', 'want', 'fascinating', 'read', 'making', 'film', 'try', 'get', 'long', 'print', 'Story', 'Misfits', 'James', 'Goode', 'Published', '1963', 'day', 'day', 'chronicle', 'films', 'making', 'only', 'year', 'M.M', 'tragic', 'death', 'memory', 'total', 'respect', 'legend', 'had', 'already', 'begun', 'sad', 'ultimatley', 'hope', 'filled', 'little', 'drama', 'filmed', 'almost', 'lifeless', 'desert', 'maybe', 'not', 'viewer', 'looking', 'lots', 'excitement', 'action', ""'re"", 'serious', 'viewer', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'brilliantly', 'subtle', 'performances', 'starring', 'two', 'filmdoms', 'biggest', 'legends', 'movie', 'steeped', 'Hollywood', 'folklore', 'then', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'film', 'How', 'fitting', 'final', 'scene', 'riding', 'off', 'heading', 'big', 'star']",Misfits VHS

398837,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,6304056877,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[20, 23]","Director John Huston had the vision, and his images were taunt, stark, choked in white dust, and bathed in high desert darkness. Arthur Miller wrote the screenplay, possibly as a birthday present for his wife, Marilyn Monroe; a panegyric valentine to salve the pain of her recent miscarriage. Regardless, Miller wrote a powerful tale, something trancendent. He was out to slay the myth of the macho western; creating three male characters named Gay, Guido, and Percy; men that bonded, and held their fears at arm's length. These men feared commitment, and they cherished their freedom at the sacrifice of everything and everyone in their wake.In its day, this movie was the most expensive black-and-white film ever produced. Critics praised it and panned it equally, but all of them secretly viewed it countless times. It grows on you; like loving a plain woman. It becomes more beautiful, significant, and sensitive as you get to know it. It is multi-layered, and it was packaged magnificently. Russell Metty's cinematography was brilliant B&W; reminescent of the best of James Wong Howe. Alex North's score was colorful, touching our emotional core like the fluttering of angel's wings one moment, and then jolting us with a bombastic jazzy penetrating throb the next.The cast has been called,"" Miller's beautiful losers "", and "" Huston's heart attack "", and they were both of those things. Clark Gable gave a magnificent performance; sun-creased, visceral, raw, and unfettered. He played Gay, a malcontent that preyed on divorcees and wild mustangs, always looking for that free ride, and expending his entire supply of virility and youth in the process. It is fitting that this performance was the capstone for is career, because with this role he shared secret parts of his persona that previously had been unexplored.Much has been written about Marilyn Monroe's performance. Her dramatic work in BUS STOP, and NIAGARA touched on her potential, but only in this film did she give an indication of her true range. Yet, sadly, it showcased her limitations as an actress as well. The role was written for her, and it fit her like a tight dress. Her "" You are only happy when you can watch something die."" monologue was bravuro, but forced. She could have used a few more classes at the Actor's Studio. MM's character, Roselyn was beautiful, vulnerable, lost, fragile, yet manipulative....all qualities MM could play in her sleep; but she was also geniune, sweet, loving, and real in a way we had never seen before. The chemistry between herself and Gable was a slow burn, but just rewatch the scene in the morning in Guido's house, observe the smooth sexuality and geniuneness of emotion. MM showed a naked breast in that scene. The censors snipped it, but Huston had filmed it. America was not ready for nudity in 1961, but Marilyn Monroe was.Eli Wallach was a clenched fist as Guido, the tow truck driver, and sometimes pilot. It broke our hearts to watch his ragged yearnings, and to realize that he would never get the girl, and he would never finish building his house. Thelma Ritter was all wisecrack and wit, and deserved her oscar for her supporting role. She was a nice juxtaposition to MM's ice angel. James Barton was a wonderful drunk in the bar scene. Gable should have paid more attention to him. A later scene in which Gable is supposed to be enebriated, calling for his children, is the one false note in his performance.Montgomery Clift as Perce, was one of the walking wounded, banged-up; a bruised soul. Much has been noted about his mental state during the filming, and his medical issues; but somehow Clift made it work for his character. The scene where he lies his head in Roselyn's lap is very touching. His effeminate weakness splashed hard up against the worn leather of Gable's face, and the raw power of Wallach's passion. It was the perfect counterpoint.Nevada's high desert landscape was treated like another character, and filmed like one. We are haunted by images of the horse hunt. A creaky biplane herding them down out of the canyons, and pushing them out onto the salt flats, where the men and ropes waited. Short stocky spirited mustangs, desert horses, galloping hard, breathing their last few gasps of freedom before the men captured them, tied them down to old truck tires; preparing them for their final journey to the slaughter house, ending up as food for poodles and bull dogs.The metaphors and symbols intertwine, men and mustangs, freedom, isolation, lonliness, and desperation. But the sadness permeating the characters within the story, was beautifully balanced out with the gentle stirrings of love. That slim chance that Gay and Roselyn will have a healthy relationship. We want it to happen. We hope it will happen, even though we fear that these character might backslide and pull apart. The fade out is very upbeat; a warm breath expelled with heads tilted up, still searching for truth amongst the stars of a clear desert night sky.",5,"When a Star Dies, the Sky Weeps",1034121600,"10

It's John Huston's opus and as we all know, both Gable and Monroe's last film.  Clift didn't have much longer to live, either.  This tale, redolent of all the sadder emotions mentioned above, coupled with the end of its stars' actual lives, just sort of hangs in the sky like that star, inert yet filled with gusto.  Eli Wallach (bless his heart-still goin' strong) is all too believable as the kind of character whose emotions and motives turn on a dime.  Gable shows a conflicted, tortured side, especially when his character pathetically hollers for his children in the street of the honky tonk town (I'm betting his kids' presence at the bar was a hallucination.)  Clift bursts out in the rodeo sequence, stealing all the scenes he's in, then fades into the background like a gentleman for the final act.  But yes, it's Marilyn's movie.  The words her then husband Arthur Miller wrote for her just come trickling painfully out of her mouth, hesitantly, like zen koans.

There is so much to the simple story, you fear you might be leaving  something out. As a recent divorcee, Marilyn  meets &quot;cowboy&quot;  Gable in Reno.  There is a chemistry between them, transcending the mere  sexual attraction that seems to pervade todays' pictures.  The artistry of  her acting finally came to the fore and Gable is fantastic, their acting  playing off one another. Montgomery Cliff as the rodeo cowboy friend and  Eli Wallach, who owns a little place in the countryside, where Marilyn and  Gable first get to know each other, are wonderful supporting stars.  The  term &quot;misfit&quot; applies to the characters and the story about the  men and their attempt to round up the &quot;misfit horses&quot; on the  plain.  And of course, Marilyn is a misfit for being beautiful, sensitive  and giving of herself with the empathy for her friends and those horses she  screams to protect.She was married to Arthur Miller, who said he  really wrote this for her. When Gable died  shortly after: some said it was  because of the strain of doing a lot of the active scenes without using a  double.  When Eli Wallach says to Marilyn &quot;you care&quot;, even though  people had always taken advantage of her, you were thinking that at the  same time. Marilyn committed suicide not too long after Gable died. It was  no secret that she cared very much for Gable during the making of the  picture and that he helped in her acting and showing her feelings.The dialogue is so full of meaning that you can see this ten times and  still find something new.  Fittingly, the acting and the film were  underrated at the time. It was a misfit of a film.  Watch the last  scene again and know that there was a depth in this story about life and  death.The film is in black and white but you really don't notice  that because you become enthralled with the story, the acting, and the  musical background.

It has everything going for it. Directed by the great John Houston from a screenplay by one of America's greatest playwrights Arthur Miller,the film starred Marilyn Monroe as the just divorced Roslyn Taber, Clark Gable as Gay Langland, along with Montgomery Clift as an over-the-hill rodeo rider, Eli Wallach as a mechanic and Thelma Ritter as Rosyln's friend.Each of these characters in his or her own way is a misfit. They all are pretty much asea even though they are in the Nevada desert. The males all are in love with Roslyn, a fragile creature who cannot stand to see anything or anyone hurt. Her attitude is pitted against the cowboys' who hunt wild mustangs that eventually will be killed. The men value their independence and fear the worst thing that can happen to them, becoming paid by the hour and doing something like pumping gas. The film is beautifully shot, and the stunts with the horses are tense and breathtaking. Monroe and Gable give stunning performances. Ms. Monroe really could act if given a chance and demonstrates it here. I had always thought of Gable as a one trick pony(Rhett Butler) but he is quite wonderful here as the aging cowboy.What was going on off the set rivals the movie. Monroe's showing up late or not at all for a shoot was legendary; Clift was on a downward spiral because of substance abuse; Miller would divorce Monroe soon after the movie was finished. Gable had a heart attack days after finishing the movie and died. This was Monroe's last completed film as well. There are too many ironies here to unravel. Wallach early in the film tells Roslyn that she has ""the gift of life."" Surely no one would describe Monroe in real life in those terms. She apparently had a crush on Gable for years and convinced herself that he was her father.THE MISFITS fits very well as a fine film.",5,A Film That Ages Well,1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,1953,"['Released', '1961', 'filmed', 'beautiful', 'black', 'white', 'MISFITS', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'get', 'better', 'age', 'everything', 'going', 'Directed', 'great', 'John', 'Houston', 'screenplay', 'one', 'America', 'greatest', 'playwrights', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'film', 'starred', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'just', 'divorced', 'Roslyn', 'Taber', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Gay', 'Langland', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'over-the-hill', 'rodeo', 'rider', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'mechanic', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'Rosyln', 'friend.Each', 'characters', 'own', 'way', 'misfit', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'asea', 'even', 'are', 'Nevada', 'desert', 'males', 'are', 'love', 'Roslyn', 'fragile', 'creature', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'see', 'anything', 'anyone', 'hurt', 'attitude', 'pitted', 'cowboys', 'who', 'hunt', 'wild', 'mustangs', 'eventually', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'men', 'value', 'independence', 'fear', 'worst', 'thing', 'can', 'happen', 'becoming', 'paid', 'hour', 'doing', 'something', 'pumping', 'gas', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'stunts', 'horses', 'are', 'tense', 'breathtaking', 'Monroe', 'Gable', 'give', 'stunning', 'performances', 'Ms.', 'Monroe', 'really', 'could', 'act', 'given', 'chance', 'here', 'had', 'always', 'thought', 'Gable', 'one', 'trick', 'pony', 'Rhett', 'Butler', 'quite', 'wonderful', 'here', 'aging', 'cowboy.What', 'was', 'going', 'set', 'movie', 'Monroe', 'showing', 'up', 'late', 'not', 'shoot', 'was', 'legendary', 'Clift', 'was', 'downward', 'spiral', 'substance', 'abuse', 'Miller', 'would', 'divorce', 'Monroe', 'soon', 'movie', 'was', 'finished', 'Gable', 'had', 'heart', 'attack', 'days', 'finishing', 'movie', 'died', 'was', 'Monroe', 'last', 'completed', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'ironies', 'here', 'unravel', 'Wallach', 'early', 'film', 'Roslyn', 'gift', 'life', 'Surely', 'one', 'would', 'describe', 'Monroe', 'real', 'life', 'terms', 'apparently', 'had', 'crush', 'Gable', 'years', 'convinced', 'was', 'father.THE', 'MISFITS', 'fits', 'very', 'well', 'fine', 'film']",Misfits VHS

Montgomery Clift is a walking  rodeo accident/cowboy who joins up with them to go Mustanging.  Each  character has their own story, secrets, and pain, and Monroe seems to be  the one who draws it out of them.  Monroe gives an excellent performance,  fragile yet sexy, and it shows the kind of actress she was becoming.

Montgomery had this inherent talent - often expressing his action in subtext performance rather than through spoken dialogue, IMO. I have never really observed this astonishing talent from watching other actors' performances to the extent I do when watching Montgomery Clift's films. He was so convincing, he did not appear to be acting at all.I am able to discern what Clift's characters were feeling and saying before he spoke his lines, because Montgomery provides me with that privilege through his engrossing talent. Like they say - the eyes are the windows to our souls. Montgomery Clift had a rare gift of expressing his personal emotions by enchanting us with his feelings, humbly and in a restrained manner that was both alluring and gripping, making us want more.  Montgomery Clift was remarkable in achieving empathy for his characters in this manner of Method Acting. As a result, I am buying many of his films from Amazon.It would be a worthy undertaking if a feature film were made about Montgomery Clift, considering his auto accident that subsequently interrupted his career, igniting an apparent fragile personal life already frail, which contributed to his arguably foreseeable downward spiral. It is odd how one regretful decision and turn of events can alter one's future that leads to inevitable adverse consequences and tragedy. ""The Misfits"" is one of several films I highly recommend, in which we are privileged to view and to become enthralled by Montgomery Clift, one of Hollywood's most underrated actors of the twentieth century.",5,A Faded Star Deserves to Shine,1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,1803,"['have', 'been', 'earnestly', 'viewing', 'films', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'am', 'mesmerized', 'emotional', 'acting', 'ability', 'level', 'am', 'not', 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'big', 'screen', 'often', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Clift', 'not', 'say', 'rather', 'when', 'speaking', 'lines', 'Montgomery', 'had', 'inherent', 'talent', 'often', 'expressing', 'action', 'subtext', 'performance', 'rather', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'IMO', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'observed', 'astonishing', 'talent', 'watching', 'other', 'actors', 'performances', 'extent', 'do', 'when', 'watching', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'films', 'was', 'so', 'convincing', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'acting', 'all.I', 'am', 'able', 'discern', 'what', 'Clift', 'characters', 'were', 'feeling', 'saying', 'spoke', 'lines', 'Montgomery', 'privilege', 'engrossing', 'talent', 'say', 'eyes', 'are', 'windows', 'souls', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'had', 'rare', 'gift', 'expressing', 'personal', 'emotions', 'enchanting', 'feelings', 'humbly', 'restrained', 'manner', 'was', 'alluring', 'gripping', 'making', 'want', 'more', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'was', 'remarkable', 'achieving', 'empathy', 'characters', 'manner', 'Method', 'Acting', 'result', 'am', 'buying', 'many', 'films', 'Amazon.It', 'would', 'be', 'worthy', 'undertaking', 'feature', 'film', 'were', 'made', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'considering', 'auto', 'accident', 'subsequently', 'interrupted', 'career', 'igniting', 'apparent', 'fragile', 'personal', 'life', 'already', 'frail', 'contributed', 'arguably', 'foreseeable', 'downward', 'spiral', 'odd', 'how', 'one', 'regretful', 'decision', 'turn', 'events', 'can', 'alter', 'one', 'future', 'inevitable', 'adverse', 'consequences', 'tragedy', 'Misfits', 'one', 'several', 'films', 'highly', 'recommend', 'are', 'privileged', 'view', 'become', 'enthralled', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'underrated', 'actors', 'twentieth', 'century']",Misfits VHS

In fact a book was written about the making of this film, appropriately called 'The Making of  the Misfits'. Arthur Miller wrote this for Marilyn, even as their divorce  would began during the filming. Marilyn was famous for her unprofessional  behavior, but in this film she took it to the limits, drugs, depression,  and her general outlook made the filming of this movie over budget and  late. In fact Clark Gable in an example of cruel irony had said' &quot;That  little lady is gonna end up giving me a heart attack.&quot; Gable soon died  after the completion of this film. This was another blow to Marilyn who  grew up with the fantasy that her father was Clark Gable.The movie  itself is sad. It must have been difficult for the director to create a  movie with a plot had no real direction. The film itself brings out the  vulnerability and softness of Marilyn, which is why I like it so much. The  message of the film is entirely hers. The lines were her true feelings.  This film can be studied like a window into Marilyn's private thoughts and  feelings, a real gem for the serious Marilyn fan. Arthur had Marilyn  totally in mind when he wrote this. He may have known her better than  anybody, being married to her for four years. Not a box-office or casual  fan favorite, but a true fan will cherish it as Marilyn's last  good-bye.On another note, the 'paddleball' scene was written in during  filming.

She meets Guido (Eli Wallach), a sensitive mechanic and his pal Gay (Clark Gable), an aging cowboy.  Both men fall in love with her and she ends up living with Gay in Guido's house.  The men take Roslyn out the desert to go ""mustangin',"" but she's horrified when she learns the purpose of their trip.This story is about four aimless and rather pathetic people who have nothing to do and no place to do it in.  They're just drifting through life and for a short time, they drift together.  Gable is outstanding as the rugged old cowpoke who still wants a woman's touch.  He takes manly command of every scene and is charisma personified.  Wallach's role is  less flashy but still powerful and touching.  Montgomery Clift plays a rodeo cowboy who's been kicked in the head one too many times.  He doesn't get to do much but he's still sweet and likeable.  Marilyn is, well, Marilyn, still delivering her lines in that breathy, little-girl voice.  Only occasionally does she break through and become a real person; mostly she over-emotes and poses prettily.Filmed in black and white in a mostly barren desert, the movie is grim and depressing and doesn't let up for a minute.

Tormented souls in real life (Monroe was raised by a mentally unstable mother and others as a foster child, Gable lost the love of his life, Carole Lombard, in an airplane crash, and Clift's promising career was derailed by injuries from an car crash), all 3 play characters overwhelmed by the unpredictable turns their lives have taken. Supporting actors Thelma Ritter and Eli Wallach provide just enough stability to keep the plot believable.Screenwriter Arthur Miller rewrote the script as director John Huston tried to keep the production moving. This resulted in few wasted lines. Most of the dialogue is sublime:Roslyn Tabor (Monroe): ""I never had anybody much."" And ""I always like to feel I'm on my own.""Gay Langland (Gable): ""Everything's there"" (referring to the desert outside of Reno where most of the action takes place). And ""Dying's as natural as living.""Isabelle Steers (Ritter): ""One thing about Reno men. They remember names.""Guido (Wallach): ""Everything just happened wrong.""Perce Howland (Clift): ""Anything's better than wages."" (Referring to his preference for rodeos and rounding up wild mustangs.)Monroe was on such a downward spiral of too much alcohol and too many prescription drugs that Huston sent her off to a hospital for 2 weeks to sober her up so the film could be completed. Gable did his own stunts. Clift, Ritter, and Wallach open their souls and mix in just enough humor to balance the pathos of their characters.Filming in 100 plus degree temperatures under strained relationships may have taken a final toll: Gable died of complications from a heart attack suffered before the movie's 1961 release; Monroe died 18 months after its premier.",5,autobiographical for the stars,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,1889,"['Perhaps', 'intended', 'allegory', 'how', 'modern', 'life', 'forever', 'changed', 'old', 'West', 'Gable', 'character', 'observation', '3', 'times', 'film', 'also', 'allegory', '3', 'stars', 'Monroe', 'Gable', 'Clift', 'Tormented', 'souls', 'real', 'life', 'Monroe', 'was', 'raised', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'mother', 'others', 'foster', 'child', 'Gable', 'lost', 'love', 'life', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'airplane', 'crash', 'Clift', 'promising', 'career', 'was', 'derailed', 'injuries', 'car', 'crash', '3', 'play', 'characters', 'overwhelmed', 'unpredictable', 'lives', 'have', 'taken', 'Supporting', 'actors', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'provide', 'just', 'enough', 'stability', 'keep', 'plot', 'believable.Screenwriter', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'rewrote', 'script', 'director', 'John', 'Huston', 'tried', 'keep', 'production', 'moving', 'resulted', 'few', 'wasted', 'lines', 'Most', 'dialogue', 'sublime', 'Roslyn', 'Tabor', 'Monroe', 'never', 'had', 'anybody', 'much', 'always', 'feel', ""'m"", 'own', 'Gay', 'Langland', 'Gable', 'Everything', 'referring', 'desert', 'Reno', 'where', 'most', 'action', 'place', 'Dying', 'as', 'natural', 'living', 'Isabelle', 'Steers', 'Ritter', 'One', 'thing', 'Reno', 'men', 'remember', 'names', 'Guido', 'Wallach', 'Everything', 'just', 'happened', 'wrong', 'Perce', 'Howland', 'Clift', 'Anything', 'better', 'wages', 'Referring', 'preference', 'rodeos', 'rounding', 'up', 'wild', 'mustangs', 'Monroe', 'was', 'such', 'downward', 'spiral', 'too', 'much', 'alcohol', 'too', 'many', 'prescription', 'drugs', 'Huston', 'sent', 'off', 'hospital', '2', 'weeks', 'sober', 'up', 'so', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'completed', 'Gable', 'did', 'own', 'stunts', 'Clift', 'Ritter', 'Wallach', 'open', 'souls', 'mix', 'just', 'enough', 'humor', 'balance', 'pathos', 'characters.Filming', '100', 'degree', 'temperatures', 'strained', 'relationships', 'may', 'have', 'taken', 'final', 'toll', 'Gable', 'died', 'complications', 'heart', 'attack', 'suffered', 'movie', '1961', 'release', 'Monroe', 'died', '18', 'months', 'premier']",Misfits VHS
398857,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6304056877,Linda Linguvic,"[9, 13]","In this 1961 film Marilyn Monroe is cast a recent divorcee in Reno who has just shed her husband.  She meets up with Clark Gable, an aging cowboy, as well as Montgomery Cliff, who makes his living working in rodeos.  Then there is Eli Wallach, a former WW2 pilot who has lost his dreams.  And Thelma Ritter, an older woman who befriends Monroe.  In one way or another, they're all misfits.Gable and Monroe start a romance and move to a desert house abandoned by Wallach.  There's a lot of drinking and introspection.  Present throughout is the cruel reality of what the modern world has become.  For example, Wallach, the pilot, shoots bald eagles for the farmers, the bucking broncos in the rodeo have irritants placed under their saddles to make them lively, and mustang horses are rounded up to use for dog food.Filmed in black and white, there's an underlying feeling of sadness. And even the rather happy ending doesn't help that.  It's a good screenplay although it was rather slow at times.  But Miller sure knows how to get to the hearts and souls of his characters. I was impressed with the performances of Eli Wallach and Thelma Ritter who were not cast in starring roles.  And Montgomery Cliff is a fine actor and is outstanding.  As for Gable and Monroe - well, I don't know.  Gable has a few good scenes but mostly he doesn't seem real.  And Monroe just can't act.  She's all right when she's cast as a dumb blonde, but this was a serious role.  Her performance here was wooden and amateurish.I wish there had been some special features on the DVD, but there was nothing more than the original trailer.  The film held my interest though, and is worth seeing just because of its history.  It's the last film that Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable appeared in before their deaths.  And Arthur Miller wrote it especially for Marilyn while he was living in Reno and awaiting a divorce in order to marry her.  The director, John Huston, was one of Hollywood's best at the time.

398858,A82G34PJ0HIXL,6304056877,Marilyn Mercury,"[4, 7]","this is a nice, little movie. MM is neurotic, highly inquisitive, and sad. Ritter is sassy, funny, confident, and flirty. clift is energetic, kind, drunk, and touching. gable is lively, loud, tough, down too earth, a real man's man. eli wallach is kind of vindictive, smart, in love with MM's character, and likes his own way. by no means is this Oscar worthy or ""the ultimate motion picture"" as it was heralded in its day. it is just too simplistic for that. it is simple b/c the plot/storyline is not deep: monroe is a lost, depressed and heartbroken divorcee who needs a retreat and is talked into it by Gable and Wallach. she hangs out with them all they way to their catching of the mustang horses. she argues and fights with them to let them go, and eventually gable and clift do, to the behest of wallach. i guess the movie's very interesting too b/c there was so much ""star power"": gable, clift, monroe, and written by the great Miller. now that you know the plot, it's more important to know the performances; thats the best this movie has to offer. in my initial watching of this i did not like Marilyn in it even though i am a huge fan. she seemed so sad and cranky. and i guess i'm annoyed of people who act like that. but after watching it a few more times, i came to realize that i had to accept that this was essential for her character. it was just at first it was a shock but i got over it. i think MM gave an excellent performance. really great. this lady has talent for comedy or drama. Now Thelma Ritter who i was, and still am unfamiliar with, absolutely shines. she should have at least been nominated for an Oscar. she is hillarious and her performance is so real. Monty Clift I was only a bit familar with, but after seeing his performance in this I am definitely interested in him. he is a great actor. he commands the screen. i think his is my fave in this (and MM is tough to beat!) i love the scene on the way to his rodeo match where he's drunkingly hailing his rodeo pals; he says to mm, gable, ritter, and wallach, ""look! over there's bob! (i can't remember the name), boy does he hate his wife!"" then he shouts to the guy ""hey bob, how's your wife?!"" it might not seem so funny, but they way he says it and acts it really cracks you up. another joke is ""i went to a club once called the Naked Truth.....and boy they weren't lying!!"" it's this kind of humor that makes The Misfits a good movie. and it was surprising b/c Arthur Miller is so serious, and not known for laughy but his writing shows he has a great sense of humor. i think Miller's script and dialogue is excellent. MM looks absolutely beautiful in this. i was really surprised that despite of all the drugs and alcohol she is very pretty. i highly reccomend this movie; it won't change your life, but you might learn a thing or 2, and it will definitely entertain you, and if you are fans of any of the actors you should get it even more. mostly get it to watch Ritter and Clift's performances.",5,i really liked it!

398860,A3QFC8X23IR3QC,6304056877,"Michael C. Smith ""MGMboy@aol.com""","[70, 74]","This once nearly forgotten movie, the last film of Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe is now coming forward in the lexicon of film history as an underrated gem.  Universally misunderstood for the most part at the time it came out it is clear now that this film was at least five of six years ahead of it's time. It fits in more comfortably with films of the late 60's and early 70's.The screenplay by Miller is one of his most striking works. A story of a group of people lost in the wide expanse of the West in search of the discarded souls of their misspent lives. The film's beautiful cinematography by Russell Metty stands out as superb artistry at the demise of the black and white era. It shimmers with the silver of the deep expanse of the desert and the flat grays and blacks of the distant mountains upon which the last act of the story plays. The music by Alex North is among his best work and gives a savage punch to the aerial scenes and the round up at the end of the wild mustangs.Montgomery Clift, by now sliding into the last years of his life is touching in his performance of Perce. His broken cowboy with the broken heart is almost painful to watch. His phone call home to his mother is among some of his best work.  Eli Wallach gives a strong deeply moving portrait of Guido who has lost his wife, his way, and his humanity. He shines in his scene with Monroe where he asks her to save him. When she can't to at least say ""Hello Guido"".Thelma Ritter is, well, Thelma Ritter in yet another of her excellent character roles. Ritter is the master of the one line wisecrack but here as Isobel she laces the cracks with an underlying sadness and vulnerability.As Gay Langland, Clark Gable gives what I consider to be the best performance of his career.  It was a brave move for Gable to take on the role of what on the surface seems another one of his typical macho made to fit parts. But as the story unfolds from Arthur Miller's pen Gay reveals that beneath his gruff, not a care in the world, cowboy is a man in deep pain and despair at his losses. The world has left him behind. Abandoned by his children the drunken Gable breaks so violently it is a shock to watch the great man fall. This is Clark Gable at his finest ever.Marilyn Monroe gives an astounding performance as Roslyn Tabler the newly divorced dancer. A damaged woman who finds in the company of these three men something to finally believe in, something to stand up and fight for, she finds life. It is a performance ground out in part from her own person and experience and in part by the director John Huston and the editor George Tomasini who helped a nearly destroyed Monroe create her stunning Roslyn. This, her last performance is her best and the true example of the collaborative creation that film really is. That Marilyn under the circumstances of her life at that time could be so good is a testament to her talent as an actress and a star. Watch her when she is listening to the other actors. This is where she shines; this is the true mark of a great screen actor. To be able to listen and draw you into the inner life of the character through that deceptively simple act of listening and reaction is her gift to the audience.  Her scene with Monty in back of the bar, sitting on a pile of trash, her afore mentioned scene with Eli Wallach in the speeding car. These are but a few of the examples in this film of her great talent. In the 1950's and early 60's there were only a handful of great young actresses in film, Elizabeth Taylor, and Marilyn Monroe where at the summit of the small mountain.",5,A Lesson In Film,1059696000,"08 1, 2003",2003,3592,"['once', 'nearly', 'forgotten', 'movie', 'last', 'film', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'now', 'coming', 'forward', 'lexicon', 'film', 'history', 'underrated', 'gem', 'Universally', 'misunderstood', 'most', 'part', 'time', 'came', 'clear', 'now', 'film', 'was', 'least', 'five', 'six', 'years', 'ahead', 'time', 'more', 'comfortably', 'films', 'late', '60', 'early', ""70's.The"", 'screenplay', 'Miller', 'one', 'most', 'striking', 'works', 'story', 'group', 'people', 'lost', 'wide', 'expanse', 'West', 'search', 'discarded', 'souls', 'misspent', 'lives', 'film', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Russell', 'Metty', 'out', 'superb', 'artistry', 'demise', 'black', 'white', 'era', 'silver', 'deep', 'expanse', 'desert', 'flat', 'grays', 'blacks', 'distant', 'mountains', 'last', 'act', 'story', 'plays', 'music', 'Alex', 'North', 'best', 'work', 'savage', 'punch', 'aerial', 'scenes', 'round', 'up', 'end', 'wild', 'mustangs.Montgomery', 'Clift', 'now', 'sliding', 'last', 'years', 'life', 'touching', 'performance', 'Perce', 'broken', 'cowboy', 'broken', 'heart', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'phone', 'call', 'home', 'mother', 'best', 'work', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'strong', 'deeply', 'moving', 'portrait', 'Guido', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'way', 'humanity', 'scene', 'Monroe', 'where', 'save', 'When', 'ca', ""n't"", 'least', 'say', 'Hello', 'Guido', '.Thelma', 'Ritter', 'well', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'yet', 'excellent', 'character', 'roles', 'Ritter', 'master', 'one', 'line', 'wisecrack', 'here', 'Isobel', 'cracks', 'underlying', 'sadness', 'vulnerability.As', 'Gay', 'Langland', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'was', 'brave', 'move', 'Gable', 'take', 'role', 'what', 'surface', 'one', 'typical', 'macho', 'made', 'fit', 'parts', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'pen', 'Gay', 'reveals', 'beneath', 'gruff', 'not', 'care', 'world', 'cowboy', 'man', 'deep', 'pain', 'despair', 'losses', 'world', 'left', 'Abandoned', 'children', 'drunken', 'Gable', 'breaks', 'so', 'violently', 'shock', 'watch', 'great', 'man', 'fall', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'finest', 'ever.Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'astounding', 'performance', 'Roslyn', 'Tabler', 'newly', 'divorced', 'dancer', 'damaged', 'woman', 'who', 'company', 'three', 'men', 'something', 'finally', 'believe', 'something', 'stand', 'up', 'fight', 'life', 'performance', 'ground', 'part', 'own', 'person', 'experience', 'part', 'director', 'John', 'Huston', 'editor', 'George', 'Tomasini', 'who', 'helped', 'nearly', 'destroyed', 'Monroe', 'create', 'stunning', 'Roslyn', 'last', 'performance', 'best', 'true', 'example', 'collaborative', 'creation', 'film', 'really', 'Marilyn', 'circumstances', 'life', 'time', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'testament', 'talent', 'actress', 'star', 'Watch', 'when', 'listening', 'other', 'actors', 'where', 'true', 'mark', 'great', 'screen', 'actor', 'be', 'able', 'listen', 'draw', 'inner', 'life', 'character', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'act', 'listening', 'reaction', 'gift', 'audience', 'scene', 'Monty', 'back', 'bar', 'sitting', 'pile', 'trash', 'afore', 'mentioned', 'scene', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'speeding', 'car', 'are', 'few', 'examples', 'film', 'great', 'talent', '1950', 'early', '60', 'were', 'only', 'handful', 'great', 'young', 'actresses', 'film', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'where', 'summit', 'small', 'mountain']",Misfits VHS

I think Marilyn was, incidentally, one of the sources of the problems in movies today where there is too much of a prominence placed on symbolism over substance.  Having said that, Marilyn did a pretty good job in this movie.  I saw more substance in this movie than all the others I've seen combined.  The scene in the desert, where she screams at the brutality of the misfits, was top notch.  In that scene, and a few others in the movie, she displayed some acting talent that is missing in most of today's top starlets.  She evoked a lot of power in some scenes without saying a word.  In other scenes, she over acted a little.Gable played Gable throughout most of the movie, but the scene when he cried out to children was an odd scene for him to take part in.  It showed more weakness in the few minutes it occurred than I've seen in most of the few Gable movies I've seen.Clift was good, but I've seen him better in other movies.  He tended to play the same character in many of his movies, and that character was in this movie too.  He may have been a good actor, but I never saw too much range from him.The movie itself was uneven and inconsistent.  The lead to the arc was very interesting.  I can see why it was considered an off movie for it's era. It kind of lost itself in the arc, however, and I found myself wavering a little in the midst of the overdrawn characterization and setting.  There were interesting scenes, and I can see why some of the scenes were important, but they were a little too long.  Other scenes seemed irrelevant to me.  The close of the movie, from the point where they reach the desert on, was excellent.  All of the characters--even the Eli Wallach character--were rounded out here.  The close of the movie provided an explanation for why some of the scenes that I considered irrelevant were in fact relevant.  Overall, I considered this a really good movie.  It had problems sure, but I would definitely recommend it.",3,An Interesting Piece,1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,2088,"['did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'last', 'movie', 'Marilyn', 'Gable', 'was', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'think', 'Marilyn', 'was', 'incidentally', 'one', 'sources', 'problems', 'movies', 'today', 'where', 'too', 'much', 'prominence', 'placed', 'symbolism', 'substance', 'Having', 'said', 'Marilyn', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'movie', 'saw', 'more', 'substance', 'movie', 'others', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'combined', 'scene', 'desert', 'where', 'brutality', 'misfits', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'scene', 'few', 'others', 'movie', 'displayed', 'acting', 'talent', 'missing', 'most', 'today', 'top', 'starlets', 'evoked', 'lot', 'power', 'scenes', 'saying', 'word', 'other', 'scenes', 'over', 'acted', 'little.Gable', 'played', 'Gable', 'most', 'movie', 'scene', 'when', 'cried', 'out', 'children', 'was', 'odd', 'scene', 'take', 'part', 'showed', 'more', 'weakness', 'few', 'minutes', 'occurred', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'few', 'Gable', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen.Clift', 'was', 'good', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'other', 'movies', 'tended', 'play', 'same', 'character', 'many', 'movies', 'character', 'was', 'movie', 'too', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'actor', 'never', 'saw', 'too', 'much', 'range', 'him.The', 'movie', 'was', 'uneven', 'inconsistent', 'lead', 'arc', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'considered', 'off', 'movie', 'era', 'kind', 'lost', 'arc', 'however', 'found', 'wavering', 'little', 'midst', 'overdrawn', 'characterization', 'setting', 'were', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'scenes', 'were', 'important', 'were', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'Other', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'irrelevant', 'close', 'movie', 'point', 'where', 'reach', 'desert', 'was', 'excellent', 'characters', 'even', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'character', 'were', 'rounded', 'out', 'here', 'close', 'movie', 'provided', 'explanation', 'why', 'scenes', 'considered', 'irrelevant', 'were', 'fact', 'relevant', 'Overall', 'considered', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'had', 'problems', 'sure', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend']",Misfits VHS

398866,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6304056877,Only-A-Child,"[5, 6]","""The Misfits"" is a character study about people who are unable or stubbornly unwilling to adapt to the world; or to the changing world. The title characters have all been seriously hurt in the process of living and are searching (consciously and unconsciously) for ways to cope with what has happened to them in the past. To the extent that they represent an almost universal condition, the film is an allegorical study, with each character meant to illustrate a different means of coping with the realization of ones growing irrelevancy..The film, perhaps more perfect because of its flaws, should remind viewers of ""The Unforgiven"", ""Ride the High Country"", and ""Cutter's Way"".Arthur Miller's script is a good one, but it is John Huston's direction that transforms good into great. In part from his inspired casting and in part from his ability to draw career best ""serious"" performances from his four stars.The initial setting is Reno, symbolically appropriate because as the quickie divorce capital, it is a place where people try to scrap off the excess baggage of their pasts. Roslyn (Marilyn Monroe) has come there for this purpose and her new freedom is a beacon to her three male co-stars. Her beauty and childlike innocence is a catalyst for the three because she tangibly represents a future that all feel will slip away from them without her. All three of the men are essentially dead, a condition that Roslyn finally grasps toward the end of the film. The Roslyn character never entirely comes into focus, and Monroe is actually shot in soft-focus; intentionally contrasting with the sharp focus of the others.There is not a great deal of conflict between the characters, mostly they are fighting their own internal battles.A mechanic, Guido (Eli Wallach), wants to possess her as a way to rekindle his dream of domestic bliss, which was destroyed when his wife died. A former WWII pilot who flies an old biplane, Guido still owns a half-finished house in the country; its construction (and the forward progress of his life) stopped with the death of his wife.Guido copes by living in the distant past (symbolized by his ancient tattered biplane), complaining about the unjust recent past, and scheming (not dreaming) about the future. Late in the film Wallach's character undergoes an abrupt and inconsistent transition. This is the film's one major flaw and may have resulted from Monroe's fear that Wallach's character as originally scripted would over shadow hers.Perce (Montgomery Clift) is a relatively young rodeo rider who has been kicked in the head a few too many times. His idyllic childhood was shattered by the death of his father and his mother's remarriage. Deprived of his destiny by these events, he copes by dulling his senses with bruises, concussions, and alcohol. He is too sensitive when clear-headed to deal with reality of the outside world.Gay (Clark Gable) is an old-time cowboy who is estranged from his wife and family. Unable to control that situation he is determined to retain control of himself, vowing to remain independent and not work for wages. He wants to possess and control Roslyn as well.Eventually the four characters set out on a venture to round up wild Mustangs and sell them to a dog food manufacturer. Out on the isolated range the four characters face their own demons and each other. ""Mustanging"" (essentially misfit humans rounding up misfit horses) was once a romantic adventure, but what seemed OK when the wild horses were numerous seems cruel and pathetic given their diminished number. And it is clearly not a self-sustaining venture as even Guy realizes that the depleted herds offer no future to the cowhand wishing to remain independent.The climatic scene has Guy struggling to subdue a wild stallion, which symbolically represents the world that has changed out from under him. He knows that he must change to have a future, but stubbornly refuses the efforts of anyone to dictate that change. He will change, but it will be on his own terms. By the end, he and Roslyn learn to respect each other, a respect that has everything to do with freedom and nothing to do with possession.Monroe gives her finest serious performance. Determined to make it as a serious actress, she had by this time devoted considerable time to the study of acting. Huston taps into a method performance which is effective because she is able to let her own vulnerability shine through. Much like Elizabeth Hartman's stuff, you are not sure how much of the tortured character is acting and how much is coming from inside the actress. Whatever it is, it is very effective.Then again, what do I know?

398868,A39IY0JU5JI69G,6304056877,"Promise ""promise""","[3, 4]","I've read most of these readers reviews and agree with little bits here and there.  Some of the bits of info contradict each other though---namely the motivation of Arthur Miller who wrote the script.  Some say he wrote it as a valentine for Marilyn, others that he wrote it for her while he was in Reno awaiting his divorce so he could marry her.  Others say that he wrote it as a revenge when they were divorcing.  Hmm.  One reviewer quoted Judy Garland saying that she hated Miller for exposing MM here.  (It got a lot worse in ""After the Fall"" when he got really nasty. He and Philip Roth should share honors for falling in love with beautiful blond women, their opposites, and then trashing them in their work, and calling it ""literature."")It's impossible to separate the legends from this movie because they were all legends.  Miller, for whatever his own reasons, crafted a decent script, at least a vehicle for the artist John Huston to film a beautiful movie, and for these memorable actors to perform.  Putting them all together was, by all accounts, difficult but this film emerges as a lovely gift.  We get to see Marilyn at the height of her beauty, when she's beginning to outgrow her pathetic ""sexy"" mannerisms (although she does quiver her upper lip a little too much in the beginning).  She is luminous and despite the problems of the script, the ponderous, stagy-ness of it, just having the privilege of watching this beautiful creature is wonderful.I've never been a big fan of Clark Gable but he, too, seemed to begin to transcend his screen persona a bit here.  I agree that the scene  outside of the bar where he cried out for his missing son, was a recourse to the MGM old-school of acting, but his physical presence, too, was a gift. He embodies goodness and decency.  The scene where he roped the horse was amazing.  It makes me feel good that he must have been very pleased with his performance, before his death, two weeks later.I agree with the reader who said that he (she?) felt little chemistry between MM and CG, but that they were there between MM and Clift.  I kept hoping she'd ditch the macho old guy and go off with sensitive gorgous Monty.  It was not to be, I guess.  Rosalind (MM's character) was a lost soul, a wounded child in the body of a beautiful woman...an image she revved up to the max as it seemed like the only way she could get attention/love.  She found this father figure in Gable who offered some sense of stability (shades of MM and Arthur Miller) so it was in his arms that she ended up.  The self-destructive Perce (Clift) was too sacrificial in giving up his interest in her.Again one can't separate this film from what has become public knowledge about it's principles (including Miller).  The theme of wildness, raw masculine energy---hmmm---I can see how they would fascinate the bookish, bespectacled Miller.  (I share Judy Garland's opinion that he exploited Marilyn...)Much could be said about the themes of what constitutes true feminity, masculinity, real love, etc. that are touched on here.

398869,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6304056877,Randy Keehn,"[12, 13]","""The Misfits"" was an unusual film for 1961.  It has an all-star cast, an all-star director and a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer.  It would be rather arrogant to suggest that the movie was ahead of its' time but its' hard to escape that feeling.  I saw it as a young man many years ago and, frankly, I couldn't appreciate it then.  I saw it recently and was impressed by what I saw.  This is a brilliantly written, acted, and directed movie about individualists in a world oriented towards conformity.There are a number of great scenes in the movie including one in which Marilyn Monroe is playing the child's game of paddle ball in a bar.  It's a cinema classic.  The scene where Clark Gable and company capture and supposedly break a wild mustang is the allegory of the whole movie.  Untameable individuals seek to break untameable horses.  It was a real Donnybrook (and supposedly hastened Gable's early death) with an exhausted Gable seemingly the victor.  Marilyn Monroe perhaps saw the irony of the situation (or else reacted over femininely to an overly masculine act) and counter-reacts to the situation.  The zenith is followed by the nadir and we are left with the idea that more than one stallion has been broken.This was the last movie for Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe (and, I think, for Montgomery Clift as well).  People are still mourning the passing of MM but it is Gable that I think of when I think of ""The Misfits"".  Anyone who views any combination of Post WWII Gable movies has to realize that the man was a star in name only.  You can blame a lot on the Studio control of what movies he was to star in.  However, his acting was largely uninspired.  His romantic scenes were robotic and he seemed to wear a constant scowl.  His last hurrah was ""The Misfits"" and he certainly made the most of it.  His exuberance, so long missing in action, was back with a vengeance.  What his career might have looked like with more misfits like this is tempting to contemplate.  Better, though, to just say, ""What a way to go!""",5,A Grand Exit,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,2033,"['Misfits', 'was', 'unusual', 'film', '1961', 'all-star', 'cast', 'all-star', 'director', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize-winning', 'writer', 'would', 'be', 'rather', 'arrogant', 'suggest', 'movie', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'hard', 'escape', 'feeling', 'saw', 'young', 'man', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'frankly', 'could', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'then', 'saw', 'recently', 'was', 'impressed', 'what', 'saw', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'acted', 'directed', 'movie', 'individualists', 'world', 'oriented', 'towards', 'are', 'number', 'great', 'scenes', 'movie', 'including', 'one', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'playing', 'child', 'game', 'paddle', 'ball', 'bar', 'cinema', 'classic', 'scene', 'where', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'company', 'capture', 'supposedly', 'break', 'wild', 'mustang', 'allegory', 'whole', 'movie', 'Untameable', 'individuals', 'seek', 'break', 'untameable', 'horses', 'was', 'real', 'Donnybrook', 'supposedly', 'hastened', 'Gable', 'early', 'death', 'exhausted', 'Gable', 'seemingly', 'victor', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'perhaps', 'saw', 'irony', 'situation', 'else', 'reacted', 'over', 'femininely', 'overly', 'masculine', 'act', 'counter-reacts', 'situation', 'zenith', 'followed', 'nadir', 'are', 'left', 'idea', 'more', 'one', 'stallion', 'been', 'broken.This', 'was', 'last', 'movie', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'think', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'as', 'well', 'People', 'are', 'still', 'mourning', 'passing', 'MM', 'Gable', 'think', 'when', 'think', 'Misfits', 'Anyone', 'who', 'combination', 'Post', 'WWII', 'Gable', 'movies', 'realize', 'man', 'was', 'star', 'name', 'only', 'can', 'blame', 'lot', 'Studio', 'control', 'what', 'movies', 'was', 'star', 'However', 'acting', 'was', 'largely', 'uninspired', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'were', 'robotic', 'seemed', 'wear', 'constant', 'scowl', 'last', 'hurrah', 'was', 'Misfits', 'certainly', 'made', 'most', 'exuberance', 'so', 'long', 'missing', 'action', 'was', 'back', 'vengeance', 'What', 'career', 'might', 'have', 'looked', 'more', 'misfits', 'tempting', 'contemplate', 'Better', 'though', 'just', 'say', 'What', 'way', 'go']",Misfits VHS

Naturally, I had a darker view and saw them as empty losers.  We argued.Now, 30 years later, I watched this inspiringly bleak film again.  This time, while still believing they were losers, I also saw it as a portrait of a time and place, an amazing bit of historical context about Reno Nevada.  The acting is unbelievably good, I think the best career performances of Monroe, Gable, and Clift.  The script is utterly superb and unforgiving, unromantic.The protagonists are all sad cases, but they are striving for love and fulfillment in a unforgiving world.  They come together in the most mundane of circumstances, in a place where everything is stupidly temporary and devoid of the possibility of change.  They live in the present, dimly perceive what is missing from their lives and what pain there is in their pasts, but keep going by drink and action and the courting of danger.  Then, there is the possibility of something new in Monroe's character, and three men cluster around her in hope.The result is simply incredible drama, one of Miller's greatest works in my opinion.  He is a first-rate writer, exploring depths and times where the normal American (like me) doesn't want to look.

398875,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,6304056877,"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[6, 7]","One of the fascinating aspects about moviegoing is the way some movies are critical and box office failures originally, but seem like masterpieces decades later.  I am thinking of Griffith's INTOLERANCE (1916), Lubitsch's TROUBLE IN PARADISE (1932), Ford's THE SEARCHERS (1956), Hitchcock's VERTIGO (1958) and MARNIE (1964), and Wilder's AVANTI! (1972).John Huston's ghostly B&W; western, THE MISFITS (1961), joins that group.  It is a melancholy western for adults that was panned originally for Arthur Miller's original screenplay; specifically the way the central character of Roslyn Tabor too closely mirrored Miller's estranged wife, Marilyn Monroe.  Actually, it is a superb script and one of Monroe's very finest, most complex performances.  I know it was a hard film to make, on location in Reno and the surrounding salt flat Nevada desert in temperatures above 100 degrees.  And Marilyn was frequently late to the set.  Clark Gable, in his last film and one of HIS best ever, was in bad health.  They blamed his death from a heart attack after filming was completed on Monroe's tardiness, but Gable was smoking three packs of cigarettes a day in this heat and doing his own stunt work with wild horses.  45 years later, both Gable and Monroe both deserve Oscars.  They were not even nominated.THE MISFITS is one of my very favorite Huston movies, no matter how difficult it was to make.  Monroe's Roslyn is a disillusioned Reno divorcee who bonds with a group of aging men, led by Gable's Gay Langland and Eli Wallach's Guido.  The men are lost in time, anachronisms, as they rope wild horses in the Nevada desert for eventual dog food.  They are joined by Thelma Ritter as Isobel, another divorcee; and Montgomery Clift, as an unstable rodeo rider named Perce.What we have is a character study, magnificently written by Miller (who was getting divorced from Monroe at the time) and directed by Huston.  There is not much of a story.  The men get drunk in Reno, then chat in a house on the outskirts of town about how the business of wild horse roping has changed, then get drunk in town again.  Their behavior fascinates Roslyn, who is a lost soul, much like the real Marilyn Monroe one year before her mysterious 1962 death.  Roslyn at first does not realize what the men are doing in roping the horses out in the desert.  When she does realize the animals will be victims of dog food dealers, she turns on the men and becomes an animal rights activist.  That, in turn, gets the men realizing that maybe Roslyn is right and how much the whole ""misfits"" business has changed from the days of 30 or 40 horses, not 4 or 5.  Are the horses or the men the real ""misfits"" here?  The script got panned originally for being pretentious; I find it engrossing and real.THE MISFITS is exquisitely made, with special mention of Russell Metty's B&W; photography that creates a ghost landscape in the Nevada desert, and Alex North's powerful music score.  More than four decades after its release, it remains a movie masterpiece with at least five brilliant performances that have withstood the test of time.  It is a classic example of tormented actors bringing their own minds and personalities to their characters, with magnificent and eerie results.  Gable died right after filming, Monroe was dead a year later, and Clift never recovered from a 1956 auto accident that had him addicted to painkillers for the rest of his life.John Huston keenly uses the actors' real personalities to great advantage with the characters of Roslyn, Gay, Guido, Perce, and Isobel.  Maybe that was as cruel of him as Miller using his estranged wife as the model for Roslyn.  It certainly wasn't the only time this has happened with filmmaking.  And it certainly will not be the last.  You use whatever you need to do to make the best movie you can with your actors.  The result with THE MISFITS is a movie gem for at least me, with towering performances and complex character conflicts.  Monroe, in fact, is so breathtakingly good here that one can only wonder what she would have achieved if she had lived another decade, including much-deserved awards she never received during her short life.",5,A ghostly moon landscape of a western,1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,4177,"['One', 'fascinating', 'aspects', 'moviegoing', 'way', 'movies', 'are', 'critical', 'box', 'office', 'failures', 'originally', 'seem', 'masterpieces', 'decades', 'later', 'am', 'thinking', 'Griffith', 'INTOLERANCE', '1916', 'Lubitsch', 'TROUBLE', 'IN', 'PARADISE', '1932', 'Ford', 'THE', 'SEARCHERS', '1956', 'Hitchcock', 'VERTIGO', '1958', 'MARNIE', '1964', 'Wilder', 'AVANTI', '1972', '.John', 'Huston', 'ghostly', 'B', 'W', 'western', 'THE', 'MISFITS', '1961', 'group', 'melancholy', 'western', 'adults', 'was', 'panned', 'originally', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'original', 'screenplay', 'specifically', 'way', 'central', 'character', 'Roslyn', 'Tabor', 'too', 'closely', 'mirrored', 'Miller', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Actually', 'superb', 'script', 'one', 'Monroe', 'very', 'finest', 'most', 'complex', 'performances', 'know', 'was', 'hard', 'film', 'make', 'location', 'Reno', 'surrounding', 'salt', 'flat', 'Nevada', 'desert', 'temperatures', '100', 'degrees', 'Marilyn', 'was', 'frequently', 'late', 'set', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'last', 'film', 'one', 'HIS', 'best', 'ever', 'was', 'bad', 'health', 'blamed', 'death', 'heart', 'attack', 'filming', 'was', 'completed', 'Monroe', 'tardiness', 'Gable', 'was', 'smoking', 'three', 'packs', 'cigarettes', 'day', 'heat', 'doing', 'own', 'stunt', 'work', 'wild', 'horses', '45', 'years', 'later', 'Gable', 'Monroe', 'deserve', 'Oscars', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'nominated.THE', 'MISFITS', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'Huston', 'movies', 'matter', 'how', 'difficult', 'was', 'make', 'Monroe', 'Roslyn', 'disillusioned', 'Reno', 'divorcee', 'who', 'bonds', 'group', 'aging', 'men', 'led', 'Gable', 'Gay', 'Langland', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'Guido', 'men', 'are', 'lost', 'time', 'anachronisms', 'rope', 'wild', 'horses', 'Nevada', 'desert', 'eventual', 'dog', 'food', 'are', 'joined', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'Isobel', 'divorcee', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'unstable', 'rodeo', 'rider', 'named', 'have', 'character', 'study', 'magnificently', 'written', 'Miller', 'who', 'was', 'getting', 'divorced', 'Monroe', 'time', 'directed', 'Huston', 'not', 'much', 'story', 'men', 'get', 'drunk', 'Reno', 'then', 'house', 'outskirts', 'town', 'how', 'business', 'wild', 'horse', 'roping', 'changed', 'then', 'get', 'drunk', 'town', 'again', 'behavior', 'fascinates', 'Roslyn', 'who', 'lost', 'soul', 'much', 'real', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'one', 'year', 'mysterious', '1962', 'death', 'Roslyn', 'first', 'not', 'realize', 'what', 'men', 'are', 'doing', 'roping', 'horses', 'out', 'desert', 'When', 'realize', 'animals', 'will', 'be', 'victims', 'dog', 'food', 'dealers', 'men', 'animal', 'rights', 'activist', 'turn', 'men', 'realizing', 'maybe', 'Roslyn', 'right', 'how', 'much', 'whole', 'misfits', 'business', 'changed', 'days', '30', '40', 'horses', 'not', '4', '5', 'Are', 'horses', 'men', 'real', 'misfits', 'here', 'script', 'got', 'panned', 'originally', 'being', 'pretentious', 'find', 'engrossing', 'real.THE', 'MISFITS', 'exquisitely', 'made', 'special', 'mention', 'Russell', 'Metty', 'B', 'W', 'photography', 'ghost', 'landscape', 'Nevada', 'desert', 'Alex', 'North', 'powerful', 'music', 'score', 'More', 'four', 'decades', 'release', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'least', 'five', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'have', 'withstood', 'test', 'time', 'classic', 'example', 'tormented', 'actors', 'bringing', 'own', 'minds', 'personalities', 'characters', 'magnificent', 'eerie', 'results', 'Gable', 'died', 'right', 'filming', 'Monroe', 'was', 'dead', 'year', 'later', 'Clift', 'never', 'recovered', '1956', 'auto', 'accident', 'had', 'addicted', 'painkillers', 'rest', 'life.John', 'Huston', 'keenly', 'actors', 'real', 'personalities', 'great', 'advantage', 'characters', 'Roslyn', 'Gay', 'Guido', 'Perce', 'Isobel', 'Maybe', 'was', 'cruel', 'Miller', 'using', 'estranged', 'wife', 'model', 'Roslyn', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'time', 'happened', 'filmmaking', 'certainly', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'last', 'use', 'need', 'do', 'make', 'best', 'movie', 'can', 'actors', 'result', 'THE', 'MISFITS', 'movie', 'gem', 'least', 'towering', 'performances', 'complex', 'character', 'conflicts', 'Monroe', 'fact', 'so', 'breathtakingly', 'good', 'here', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'achieved', 'had', 'lived', 'decade', 'including', 'much-deserved', 'awards', 'never', 'received', 'short', 'life']",Misfits VHS

If that's what he thinks of me, well, then, I'm not for him and he's not for me."" Obviously she did not care for the script too much.  It is truly horrible, probably the worst written rubbish ever taken seriously, but only by pseudo-intellectuals who assume anything by Arthur Miller will be up to the standards of ""Death of a Salesman"".

398878,A3ILFAT3HHYOXE,6304056877,widowedwalker,"[4, 4]","John Huston's filming of Arthur Miller's THE MISFITS was dismissed at the time -- even by its doomed stars (well, ""doomed"" except for Eli Wallach, who is with us still at the grand old age of 137) but this poignant parable, set in the Nevada foothills, has aged as well as almost any film Marilyn ever did. And, in many ways, reflects most vividly what made her so distinct.Younger people sometimes ask about the nature of her appeal, what was so superlative about her?, was she overrated?, was she just another ""it girl"" for her day?, etc...In addition to being genuinely very pretty (most Hollywood ""beauties"" really are not) with an absolutely perfect feminine body (despite the occasional weight bump) Marilyn really did perfect the tormented, seemingly helpless blonde sex kitten persona better than anyone else, before or since, blending both the ""nice girl"" and ""bad girl"" archetypes of the mid-twentieth century.Also, she's one of the only ones who left behind a filmography of genuinely good pictures.But the era is also key to her appeal; they're inseparable... The idealized, picture perfect self-image America had during the sleepily optimistic new consumerism of the post-war, primary color-saturated 1950's when her career occurred, and the haunted end-of-an-world mood at the peak of the Cold War during the JFK years in the early-'60s when she died, mysteriously, in that cozy little bungalow in Brentwood.You either ""get"" that gauzy, wistful atmosphere or you don't. But it was immediately apparent even then, and it has everything to do with why Marilyn wasn't just one of the screen's greatest sex symbols (arguably, THE greatest) but an ideal icon and metaphor for an immensely promising yet fascinatingly tragic period of American history that still intrigues and confounds.
