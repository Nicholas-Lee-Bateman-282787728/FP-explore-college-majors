801511,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B0001DMW9S,Anyechka,"[79, 86]","This film, based on the memoirs of Dr. Gisella Perl, is an incredibly powerful, moving, soul-searing, and unforgettable experience.  Some people feel that there are too many books and movies about the Shoah, or that after awhile they all start to seem the same because the tale of horror is all-too familiar, but this film is moving proof that that's not the case at all.  Every person's story was different and unique in some way.  How often have we got something from the perspective of a survivor who was a doctor, and a female doctor no less, at a time when men largely dominated the medical field?  Additionally, this story is told in the present day, with flashbacks inserted every so often, instead of told in a linear format or just starting in the present and then having the bulk of the movie be one long flashback before reverting back to the present.Dr. Perl became the first female doctor, and the first female Jewish doctor at that, in her native village of Sighet in Hungary.  Even though her father initially disapproved, ever since she announced her plans as a young girl, she proved to him that she could be an observant Jew, a good doctor, a wife, and a mother.  Becoming a doctor didn't cancel out her faith or a more traditional female role, as her family had feared.  She was well-liked and trusted by her patients, and was doing very well for herself and for her family.  In addition to being an inspiration for having survived what she did, she was also living proof that women can have both a career and a family, instead of just one or the other.In the present day (a few years after the war), Dr. Perl is being examined for American citizenship.  Though she passed all of her medical boards to be allowed to practise medicine in the United States, the question remains of her character and if she collaborated with the Nazis.  There's an ocean of misunderstanding between her and her three interrogators, men who were living comfortable lives while she and her family were being treated like sub-humans, while she lost her entire family and had to do the unthinkable to try to save her own life.  People who were in the camps often had to do things that many in the outside world would consider immoral, uncivilised, or unthinkable, but one must understand that this was another planet, with its own set of rules and morals.  No one should judge anyone else for having done something to preserve one's own life.  It's not as though these things were done willingly or voluntarily.  ""Dr."" Mengele seemed to have a great deal of liking and respect for Dr. Perl, and made her work in the excuse of an infirmary at Auschwitz, even once assisting with a Gypsy patient who was pregnant with her second set of twins, a woman who was later murdered after giving birth and taken to be dissected.  She was also once called upon to give the infamous sadistic Irma Grese an abortion.  However, Dr. Perl did far, far more good than harm, often risking her life to save her patients, doing things that she would have been shot for had she been discovered doing, such as hiding a sick woman during selections in the infirmary and using her and the other doctors' blood as the pretended blood sample of a woman who had typhus.  And since her specialty was in gynecology and obstetrics, she gave about a thousand women abortions, performed without any tools no less.  She knew that this would save these women's lives, and that if they survived, they could go on to bear another child someday, a child who would be born in freedom.  Her goal, her driving force for surviving, was to continue helping to bring life into the world, keeping these Jewish women alive so they would keep their people alive and produce children who would continue to propagate their people, replenishing their ranks after how many people the Nazis slaughtered, a million and a half of whom were just children.  It is this message that she is trying to get across to the men deciding her fate as an American citizen and as a doctor.I'd highly recommend this film, both for its moving and gut-wrenching story and for its unique perspective and structure, quite different from what one usually expects from a film about the Shoah.  Christine Lahti as Dr. Perl gives an absolutely brilliant performance, and everything is brought to life so vividly that one can almost feel as though one is right there in that moment, place, and time.  I was even moved to tears a few times, something that rarely happens when I watch a film.  It's the kind of thing that stays with one for a long time afterward.",5,Absolutely spellbinding and unforgettable,1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,4580,"['film', 'based', 'memoirs', 'Dr.', 'Gisella', 'Perl', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'moving', 'soul-searing', 'unforgettable', 'experience', 'people', 'feel', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'books', 'movies', 'Shoah', 'start', 'seem', 'same', 'tale', 'horror', 'all-too', 'familiar', 'film', 'moving', 'proof', 'not', 'case', 'Every', 'person', 'story', 'was', 'different', 'unique', 'way', 'How', 'often', 'have', 'got', 'something', 'perspective', 'survivor', 'who', 'was', 'doctor', 'female', 'doctor', 'less', 'time', 'when', 'men', 'largely', 'dominated', 'medical', 'field', 'Additionally', 'story', 'told', 'present', 'day', 'flashbacks', 'inserted', 'so', 'often', 'instead', 'told', 'linear', 'format', 'just', 'starting', 'present', 'then', 'having', 'bulk', 'movie', 'be', 'one', 'long', 'flashback', 'reverting', 'back', 'present.Dr', 'Perl', 'became', 'first', 'female', 'doctor', 'first', 'female', 'Jewish', 'doctor', 'native', 'village', 'Sighet', 'Hungary', 'Even', 'father', 'initially', 'disapproved', 'ever', 'announced', 'young', 'girl', 'proved', 'could', 'be', 'observant', 'Jew', 'good', 'doctor', 'wife', 'mother', 'Becoming', 'doctor', 'did', ""n't"", 'cancel', 'out', 'faith', 'more', 'traditional', 'female', 'role', 'family', 'had', 'feared', 'was', 'well-liked', 'trusted', 'patients', 'was', 'doing', 'very', 'well', 'herself', 'family', 'addition', 'being', 'inspiration', 'having', 'survived', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'also', 'living', 'proof', 'women', 'can', 'have', 'career', 'family', 'instead', 'just', 'one', 'other.In', 'present', 'day', 'few', 'years', 'war', 'Dr.', 'Perl', 'being', 'examined', 'American', 'citizenship', 'passed', 'medical', 'boards', 'be', 'allowed', 'practise', 'medicine', 'United', 'States', 'question', 'character', 'collaborated', 'Nazis', 'ocean', 'misunderstanding', 'three', 'interrogators', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'living', 'comfortable', 'lives', 'family', 'were', 'being', 'treated', 'sub-humans', 'lost', 'entire', 'family', 'had', 'do', 'unthinkable', 'try', 'save', 'own', 'life', 'People', 'who', 'were', 'camps', 'often', 'had', 'do', 'things', 'many', 'outside', 'world', 'would', 'consider', 'immoral', 'uncivilised', 'unthinkable', 'one', 'must', 'understand', 'was', 'planet', 'own', 'set', 'rules', 'morals', 'one', 'should', 'judge', 'anyone', 'else', 'having', 'done', 'something', 'preserve', 'one', 'own', 'life', 'not', 'things', 'were', 'done', 'willingly', 'voluntarily', 'Dr.', 'Mengele', 'seemed', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'liking', 'respect', 'Dr.', 'Perl', 'made', 'work', 'excuse', 'infirmary', 'Auschwitz', 'even', 'once', 'assisting', 'Gypsy', 'patient', 'who', 'was', 'pregnant', 'second', 'set', 'twins', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'later', 'murdered', 'giving', 'birth', 'taken', 'be', 'dissected', 'was', 'also', 'once', 'called', 'upon', 'give', 'infamous', 'sadistic', 'Irma', 'Grese', 'abortion', 'However', 'Dr.', 'Perl', 'did', 'far', 'far', 'more', 'good', 'harm', 'often', 'risking', 'life', 'save', 'patients', 'doing', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'had', 'been', 'discovered', 'doing', 'such', 'hiding', 'sick', 'woman', 'selections', 'infirmary', 'using', 'other', 'doctors', 'blood', 'pretended', 'blood', 'sample', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'typhus', 'specialty', 'was', 'gynecology', 'obstetrics', 'gave', 'thousand', 'women', 'abortions', 'performed', 'tools', 'less', 'knew', 'would', 'save', 'women', 'lives', 'survived', 'could', 'go', 'bear', 'child', 'someday', 'child', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'born', 'freedom', 'goal', 'driving', 'force', 'surviving', 'was', 'continue', 'helping', 'bring', 'life', 'world', 'keeping', 'Jewish', 'women', 'alive', 'would', 'keep', 'people', 'alive', 'produce', 'children', 'who', 'would', 'continue', 'propagate', 'people', 'replenishing', 'ranks', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'Nazis', 'slaughtered', 'million', 'half', 'whom', 'were', 'just', 'children', 'message', 'trying', 'get', 'men', 'deciding', 'fate', 'American', 'citizen', 'doctor.I', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'moving', 'gut-wrenching', 'story', 'unique', 'perspective', 'structure', 'quite', 'different', 'what', 'one', 'usually', 'film', 'Shoah', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'Dr.', 'Perl', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'everything', 'brought', 'life', 'so', 'vividly', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'one', 'right', 'there', 'moment', 'place', 'time', 'was', 'even', 'moved', 'tears', 'few', 'times', 'something', 'rarely', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'kind', 'thing', 'one', 'long', 'time', 'afterward']",Out of the Ashes
801512,A3KNGA5WIECM5V,B0001DMW9S,"Beth Fox ""Beth A. Fox""","[7, 7]","This is the story of Dr. Gisella Perl and her struggle to survive Auschwitz and become an American citizen.  Dr. Perl was born to a religious Jewish family in Sighet (the same town as Elie Wiesel) and struggled, against her father's wishes, to become a doctor.  Although a doctor of reknown in her town, she was transported to Auschwitz along with all the other Jews in Sighet.  There, she tried to save as many lives as she could.  Dr. Perl also prevented women from being killed and experminted upon (and their children experimented upon) by Dr. Mengele.  This sometimes required aborting the babies before Dr. Mengele could become aware that the women were pregnant.  Although no movie can fully depict the horror of Auschwitz, this one pulls no puches.Dr. Perl manages to survive Auschwitz, but after arriving in America, must take menial jobs in hospitals.  Her story is told through an inquisition by INS officials, who question what she did in Auschwitz.  The suffering Dr. Perl endured, the things she saw, and the choices she had to make are extremely painful.  It is impossible to judge her actions without walking in her footsteps.  Who knows how any of us would act under the same circumstances?This is a remarkable story.  Christine Lahti movingly and realistically portrays Dr. Perl.

801513,A1Q6PG0Y3XZL7M,B0001DMW9S,"Book & Music thief, from HI","[0, 0]","I felt compelled to write a strong recommendation for this highly unique film (originally aired on Showtime in 2003) and true Story about Gisella Perl, a Hungarian/Jewish physician who survived Auschwitz  and valiantly attempted to covertly save/preserve as many Lives as possible while there...... but upon arriving on American shores after WWII, she faced a somewhat hostile immigration/ INS Board that had many questions regarding her means of survival at the concentration-camp, and whether she in any way (even indirectly) cooperated in carrying-out Nazi atrocities/medical experiments, etc.She then basically had to recount her uniquely harrowing story of survival (and this baring of her Soul, so to speak, elicited contradictory emotions including guilt for simply being a 'survivor').I mainly wanted to recommend this courageous film for the following reasons:1) This story is very unique and the fact that Gisella Perl was a practicing physician within the concentration-camp (even with some very small influence over 'life & death' of individual prisoners) made her tale very morally complex (i.e. her circumstance was not as clearly 'black & white' as most Holocaust stories = the element of individual human 'choice' is an extremely compelling one).2) Christine Lahti is surely one of the most authentically brilliant actresses around (on par with the great Meryl Streep), it always seems that she was a bit underrated - and tended to get more television, as opposed to theatrical Film roles.3) Since it was made for Cable TV (over ten years ago) and not shown theatrically, I'm thinking that many people have never heard of it, or possibly forgotten about it.A last-thought on this particular film:  this story really exemplifies that priceless bit of ancient wisdom = ""Whosoever preserves a single Soul....... it is as though he/she has preserved the Entire World.""",5,'Out of the Ashes' is a Courageous Film worth Remembering & seeing again (or perhaps Seeking-out for the first-Time),1404864000,"07 9, 2014",2014,1880,"['felt', 'compelled', 'write', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'highly', 'unique', 'film', 'originally', 'aired', 'Showtime', '2003', 'true', 'Story', 'Gisella', 'Perl', 'Hungarian/Jewish', 'physician', 'who', 'survived', 'Auschwitz', 'valiantly', 'attempted', 'covertly', 'save/preserve', 'many', 'Lives', 'possible', 'arriving', 'American', 'shores', 'WWII', 'faced', 'somewhat', 'hostile', 'immigration/', 'INS', 'Board', 'had', 'many', 'questions', 'regarding', 'means', 'survival', 'concentration-camp', 'way', 'even', 'indirectly', 'cooperated', 'carrying-out', 'Nazi', 'atrocities/medical', 'experiments', 'etc.She', 'then', 'basically', 'had', 'recount', 'uniquely', 'harrowing', 'story', 'survival', 'baring', 'Soul', 'so', 'speak', 'elicited', 'contradictory', 'emotions', 'including', 'guilt', 'simply', 'being', ""'survivor"", '.I', 'mainly', 'wanted', 'recommend', 'courageous', 'film', 'following', 'reasons:1', 'story', 'very', 'unique', 'fact', 'Gisella', 'Perl', 'was', 'practicing', 'physician', 'concentration-camp', 'even', 'very', 'small', 'influence', ""'life"", 'death', 'individual', 'prisoners', 'made', 'tale', 'very', 'morally', 'complex', 'i.e', 'circumstance', 'was', 'not', 'clearly', ""'black"", 'white', 'most', 'Holocaust', 'stories', '=', 'element', 'individual', 'human', ""'choice"", 'extremely', 'compelling', 'one', '.2', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'surely', 'one', 'most', 'authentically', 'brilliant', 'actresses', 'par', 'great', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'always', 'was', 'bit', 'underrated', 'tended', 'get', 'more', 'television', 'opposed', 'theatrical', 'Film', 'roles.3', 'was', 'made', 'Cable', 'TV', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'shown', 'theatrically', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'possibly', 'forgotten', 'it.A', 'last-thought', 'particular', 'film', 'story', 'really', 'priceless', 'bit', 'ancient', 'wisdom', 'Whosoever', 'single', 'Soul', 'he/she', 'preserved', 'Entire', 'World']",Out of the Ashes

If it was discovered that a women was pregnant, they were sent immediately to the gas chambers because a women with a baby had no value to do the work the Nazis required them to do.Whether you are pro life or pro abortion, this true, never to be forgotten, must see, heart rending motion picture is about the OB/gynecologist Dr. Gisella Perl (Christine Lahti) that performed abortions with her bare hands to save the life of Jewish women in the concentration camps.

How many people in this country (the USA) are aware that we now have a law/regularion in place that allows the U.S. military to place any U.S. civilian currently residing in America under arrest, at any time, for anything, for any length of time without charge(s), legal representation or a court hearing - this is the U.S. we are talking about ~ 2012?!  Before anyone accuses me of being an OWS'er, I am nearing retirement, married, mainstream, worked all my life, saved my money (been punished by our govt for doing so) and Protestant - not a right wing zealot, hater, birther, or religious nut. Very, very proud of our first African-American President but despise his policies (without being a racist no less).  Sorry, but I enjoyed (??) this film very much for the seemingly ""real"" depictions of what can only be imagined by anyone not interned in one of these hell-holes, i.e., concentration 'camps.'  I will not presume to judge Dr. Perl's actions other than to say that she will face a Judge one day that is beyond wiser than I am; however, simply in a logical manner, to me it was ""kill the fetus (baby) or let the Nazi's kill them both.""  The behavior, i.e., demeanor and tone of the interrogation by INS seemed so out of touch with what the concentration camp victims endured as to be nearly nonsensical at times but I did not live through those times, so.....  I thought Christine Lahti did an admirable job portraying Dr. Perl, hard, tough, pragmatic but forever broken from the experiences she suffered/endured.  ""Let it go already....""

Directed by Joseph Sargent and based on the autobiography of Dr. Gisella Perl, this film is about the survival of a physician (Dr. Perl) so compassionate in her dedication to her fellow inmates at Auschwitz that, knowing pregnant Jews were among the first to be cremated in the Nazi ovens, knowingly performed numerous abortions and in doing so saved the lives of countless women. As if her rigors of survival in the concentration camps and her loss of her family to the Nazis weren't enough, she immigrated to the United States for refuge, served in menial medical tasks until she was able to take and pass her exams for medical licensure only to face a panel of folk who declare her a criminal for her role in the concentration camps and make every attempt to prevent her from practicing medicine in the USA. How she survives all of this constitutes the message of this powerful film, but to divulge the ending would diminish the impact for the new viewer. As Dr. Perl, Christine Lahti (one of our most underused and finest actresses) gives a wholly credible, sensitive portrayal: her character remains etched on our minds long after the film is finished. Also in this excellent cast are Richard Crenna, Bruce Davidson, and Beau Bridges among many others in small but pungent roles.

Bernabo,"[9, 9]","I still remember the resolution of ""The Man in the Glass Booth"" as being the moment when the idea that those who survived the Nazi concentration camps could be assailed by massive guilt for coming out alive.  Robert Shaw's play raised more issues than that, and there are certain dramatic twists and turns in that particular story, but the importance of guilt and what it can do to you came through.  However, ""The Man in the Glass Booth"" is a work of fiction, and this 2003 Showtime original film is based on a true story.Out of the Ashes"" addresses more directly the idea that surviving Auschwitz could involve guilt in the particular case of Gisella Perl (Christine Lahti), a Jewish-Hungarian doctor who did just that.  She makes her way to America and wants to practice medicine again, but there are questions about what she did in the camps and to what degree she colluded with the Nazis.  Not just the Nazis, but with Dr. Joseph Mengele (Jonathan Cake).  When he discovered Perl was a doctor, he asked her to help him identify the pregnant women in the camp so that they could be taken to a special infirmary.  Of course, this is a lie, which Perl learns almost immediately.Perl has to appear before three I.N.S. investigators.  Herman Prentiss (Beau Bridges) is the most accusatory, Jake Smith (Richard Crenna) seems sympathetic, and Peter Schuman (Bruce Davison) seems troubled, so the trio provide a variety of responses to the story Perl has to tell.  In telling her story, Perl goes back to not only her time in Auschwitz, but before the Nazis came to Hungary.  As that story unfolds it becomes clear that what she did is not as important to her inquisitors, herself, or her audience, as why.  I assume that anyone who watches ""Out of the Ashes"" will be familiar with the horrors of the Holocaust, but each story told in such settings always finds a way to evoke the horror anew and this one is no different.My only real problem with ""Out of the Ashes"" is not its historical resolution but rather its dramatic.  There is a point where Perl comes to terms with her own actions, which is what allows her to go on and live her life.  We understand how it provides her with a sense of peace, but how it translates into what the decision reached by the tribunal is left unstated.  The fact that Mr. Prentiss delivers their verdict was not lost on me, but I found it hard to believe the words he speaks were written by him and I see him as the odd-man out on a split decision.  So that leaves a gap in the dramatic structure of the story, which matters because in adapting Perl's book ""I Was a Doctor in Auschwitz,"" Anne Meredith (""Bastard Out of Carolina"") has chosen for Perl's story to be revealed in the course of that inquiry. Meredith won the Writers Guild of America award for Adapted Long Form teleplay, so it is not that this is a flawed script, but that I really wanted a better sense of the judgment being offered and I found what was provided inadequate to that task.Showtime's promotions for this movie keep asking the question, ""What would you do?""  But that is really a false issue, as is the specific way that Perl tried to help women in Auschwitz, which resonates in a polarized America in a completely different way.  In interview clips Lahti talks about what Perl did as ""choiceless choices,"" and I certainly endorse the idea that judging someone when you are incapable of standing in their shoes is a senseless intellectual game.  You can say what you would do if you were in the position of Gisella Perl or the title character in ""Sophie's Choice,"" but you are separated from such decisions by some quantum differences in time and place such musing are at least absurd if not insulting.Final Note: Among the brief special features on this DVD is a map marking the location of the Nazi death camps in Eastern Europe.  The map makes a distinction between concentration camps, such as Buchenwald and Dachau, and the extermination camps such as Auschwitz-Birkenau.  It is not a distinction in nomenclature that I have followed previously, and it is hampered by an inadequate understanding of which camps fall into which categories, but it strikes me as making a valid point.",5,The choiceless choices of a Jewish doctor in Auschwitz,1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,4196,"['still', 'remember', 'resolution', 'Man', 'Glass', 'Booth', 'being', 'moment', 'when', 'idea', 'who', 'survived', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camps', 'could', 'be', 'assailed', 'massive', 'guilt', 'coming', 'out', 'alive', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'play', 'raised', 'more', 'issues', 'are', 'certain', 'dramatic', 'twists', 'turns', 'particular', 'story', 'importance', 'guilt', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'came', 'However', 'Man', 'Glass', 'Booth', 'work', 'fiction', '2003', 'Showtime', 'original', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story.Out', 'Ashes', 'more', 'directly', 'idea', 'surviving', 'Auschwitz', 'could', 'involve', 'guilt', 'particular', 'case', 'Gisella', 'Perl', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'Jewish-Hungarian', 'doctor', 'who', 'did', 'just', 'way', 'America', 'practice', 'medicine', 'again', 'are', 'questions', 'what', 'did', 'camps', 'what', 'degree', 'colluded', 'Nazis', 'Not', 'just', 'Nazis', 'Dr.', 'Joseph', 'Mengele', 'Jonathan', 'Cake', 'When', 'discovered', 'Perl', 'was', 'doctor', 'asked', 'help', 'identify', 'pregnant', 'women', 'camp', 'could', 'be', 'taken', 'special', 'infirmary', 'course', 'lie', 'Perl', 'almost', 'immediately.Perl', 'appear', 'three', 'I.N.S', 'investigators', 'Herman', 'Prentiss', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'most', 'accusatory', 'Jake', 'Smith', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'sympathetic', 'Peter', 'Schuman', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'troubled', 'trio', 'provide', 'variety', 'responses', 'story', 'Perl', 'tell', 'telling', 'story', 'Perl', 'back', 'not', 'only', 'time', 'Auschwitz', 'Nazis', 'came', 'Hungary', 'story', 'clear', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'as', 'important', 'inquisitors', 'audience', 'why', 'assume', 'anyone', 'who', 'Ashes', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'horrors', 'Holocaust', 'story', 'told', 'such', 'settings', 'always', 'way', 'evoke', 'horror', 'anew', 'one', 'different.My', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'Out', 'Ashes', 'not', 'historical', 'resolution', 'rather', 'dramatic', 'point', 'where', 'Perl', 'terms', 'own', 'actions', 'what', 'go', 'live', 'life', 'understand', 'how', 'sense', 'peace', 'how', 'what', 'decision', 'reached', 'tribunal', 'left', 'unstated', 'fact', 'Mr.', 'Prentiss', 'verdict', 'was', 'not', 'lost', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'words', 'were', 'written', 'see', 'odd-man', 'out', 'split', 'decision', 'gap', 'dramatic', 'structure', 'story', 'matters', 'adapting', 'Perl', 'book', 'Was', 'Doctor', 'Auschwitz', 'Anne', 'Meredith', 'Bastard', 'Out', 'Carolina', 'chosen', 'Perl', 'story', 'be', 'revealed', 'course', 'inquiry', 'Meredith', 'won', 'Writers', 'Guild', 'America', 'award', 'Adapted', 'Long', 'Form', 'teleplay', 'not', 'flawed', 'script', 'really', 'wanted', 'better', 'sense', 'judgment', 'being', 'offered', 'found', 'what', 'was', 'provided', 'inadequate', 'task.Showtime', 'promotions', 'movie', 'keep', 'asking', 'question', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'really', 'false', 'issue', 'specific', 'way', 'Perl', 'tried', 'help', 'women', 'Auschwitz', 'polarized', 'America', 'completely', 'different', 'way', 'interview', 'clips', 'Lahti', 'talks', 'what', 'Perl', 'did', 'choiceless', 'choices', 'certainly', 'endorse', 'idea', 'judging', 'someone', 'when', 'are', 'incapable', 'standing', 'shoes', 'senseless', 'intellectual', 'game', 'can', 'say', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'position', 'Gisella', 'Perl', 'title', 'character', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'are', 'separated', 'such', 'decisions', 'quantum', 'differences', 'time', 'place', 'such', 'musing', 'are', 'least', 'absurd', 'not', 'insulting.Final', 'Note', 'brief', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'map', 'marking', 'location', 'Nazi', 'death', 'camps', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'map', 'distinction', 'concentration', 'camps', 'such', 'Buchenwald', 'Dachau', 'extermination', 'camps', 'such', 'Auschwitz-Birkenau', 'not', 'distinction', 'nomenclature', 'have', 'followed', 'previously', 'hampered', 'inadequate', 'understanding', 'camps', 'fall', 'categories', 'making', 'valid', 'point']",Out of the Ashes

The acting, especially by Christine Lahti, is extremely convincing; the choreography and the cinematography are excellent. The musical score enhances the film and the plot moves along at a good pace.Dr. Gisella Perl (Christine Lahti) arrives in the United States after World War Two; she has seen nothing but horrific events during her imprisonment at Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp that very few people ever survived. She is met by good friend Didi Goldstein (Zoie Palmer); Gisella can't wait to begin practicing medicine again as she did when she lived in her native Hungary.Gisella is initially relegated to doing lab work in a New York hospital until after she passes the American medical boards; and the INS hesitates to grant citizenship to Gisela because they suspect that she assisted Nazi doctors including the infamously evil Dr. Mengele at Auschwitz. Gisella is shocked; she is a Jew and she shows them the numbers Nazis tattooed on her arm to mark her as a prisoner. The INS people remain skeptical and it is through many flashbacks that we learn everything that Gisella Perl did during her imprisonment at Auschwitz.Her story is incredibly painful and distressing indeed. We see how Nazis invaded the Perl residence in Hungary and sent the family to imprisonment or death in gas chambers. Despite hearing all this, the INS still can't stomach that Gisella performed abortions at Auschwitz; but she tells them that it saved the lives of pregnant Jewish women so that they might survive the war and have Jewish babies after the war is over. Some of Gisella's other actions were not always the most honorable; but she did what she had to do to survive.Actually, there's more to the plot that I left out so as not to spoil it all for you; and I won't write much more so that you can experience this movie the same way that I did! You will be glued to your seat as you watch this dark drama based on true-life events; the acting and the storyline work so very well to create an unforgettable experience. Look for Jonathan Cake to portray the evil Dr. Mengele; Ingrid Veninger as Zozia; and Emma Wellbelove plays a very young Gisella very well. Beau Bridges, Richard Crenna and Bruce Davison portray the INS agents with panache.The DVD comes with bonus features including interviews with cast members; and there is ""The Choices of Dr. Gisella Perl."" There is a map of Holocaust concentration and death camps and even more.""Out of the Ashes"" tells the story of just how far people like Dr. Gisella Perl were pushed to survive World War Two; this story deserves to be told and never forgotten.

She has emigrated to New York - her family, Hungarian Jews, were murdered at Auschwitz - and desperately wants, needs, to begin practicing medicine again.  The movie presents her as a gynecologist, a good one, as well as a strong and at times even vain woman.  Life is never simple, though.  First she must pass the medical boards, and then the immigration must give their approval for her to practice in this country.  And the panel of immigration officials have some tough questions to ask before that appoval is granted.Christine Lahti brings a full palette to her complex character and is pretty much the whole show.  The panel members (Beau Bridges, Bruce Davison and Richard Crenna in his last credited role) need to know if Perl collaborated with the German medical staff at Auschwitz, a staff headed by that arch-fiend, Joseph Mengele (Jonathan Cake.)  And, pre-Roe v. Wade, they're curious about the roughly one thousand abortions she reportedly performed while at Auschwitz.  It's the late forties, after all, and abortions were still illegal and almost universally reviled. These questions usher in flashbacks and, if not excuses, at least explanations for her actions.  Women came to Auschwitz pregnant, or were raped by the guards.  Pregnant women and women with infants were killed, and Perl made one of the many `choiceless choices' Lahti mentions in a short video interview on the dvd.I'm beginning to come to the conclusion that all the good stuff nowadays is produced by television.

Marshall,"[203, 213]","This biographical film relates the story of Auschwitz survivor, Dr. Gisella Perl, providing an important chapter into the lives of those poor souls tortured into unthinkable acts in order to survive during the Holocaust of WWII.Dr. Gisella Perl (Christine Lahti) arrives in New York with tear filled eyes begging for a new life after WWII. Perl wanted to be a doctor from childhood; she studied hard and managed to open a very successful private practice in Hungary. Her only downfall ended up being her bloodlines and this very strong woman soon found herself carted off to Auschwitz. In a series of flashbacks Perl is examined by a committee of American INS men who are judging her character as a step towards her citizenship. Perl is seen as a survivor who at times may have saved her own life at the sake of others and she is accused of collaborating with the Nazi doctor like the retched Josef Mengele. In actuality Perl saved many women by sacrificing the unborn lives of their fetuses after being tricked by Mengele into submission and having to see what went on behind the walls of Auschwitz. Despite the horrors she witnessed Perl survived to flourish once again and her true story is one of an undying spirit.Christina Lahti is phenomenal in her role as Gisella Perl. She manages to capture both the brokenness and the strength of this woman with equal determination. Many scenes in this film are absolutely gut-wrenching but entirely important. As stated in the film Auschwitz became its own country and the ""rules of humanity"" no longer applied. Under these circumstances many atrocities were committed by Nazi's and the Jewish prisoners alike...who is to say what depths a human being can reach under the horror of the Holocaust? In order to thrive in the conditions faced by the prisoners they were forced to either submit and then be burned alive or to calculate another way of living. Gisella Perl did just that. Despite how you feel about abortions this woman had to perform the procedures bare handed and under intolerable conditions in order to save the lives of women prisoners. She was forced under threat to assist in ""experiments"" beside Mengele and even went as far as saving a female Nazi guard from her own ""predicament"" without question. Placed in the same circumstances few of us would have ever survived so leave your moral judgments behind on this one. Instead allow this one woman's story to matter so that the ashes of Auschwitz and all of the other concentration camps never establish a foothold in our world again.",5,No More Fires.....Please!,1107993600,"02 10, 2005",2005,2548,"['biographical', 'film', 'story', 'Auschwitz', 'survivor', 'Dr.', 'Gisella', 'Perl', 'providing', 'important', 'chapter', 'lives', 'poor', 'souls', 'tortured', 'unthinkable', 'acts', 'order', 'survive', 'Holocaust', 'WWII.Dr', 'Gisella', 'Perl', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'New', 'York', 'tear', 'filled', 'eyes', 'begging', 'new', 'life', 'WWII', 'Perl', 'wanted', 'be', 'doctor', 'childhood', 'studied', 'hard', 'managed', 'open', 'very', 'successful', 'private', 'practice', 'Hungary', 'only', 'downfall', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'bloodlines', 'very', 'strong', 'woman', 'soon', 'found', 'carted', 'off', 'Auschwitz', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'Perl', 'examined', 'committee', 'American', 'INS', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'judging', 'character', 'step', 'citizenship', 'Perl', 'seen', 'survivor', 'who', 'times', 'may', 'have', 'saved', 'own', 'life', 'sake', 'others', 'accused', 'collaborating', 'Nazi', 'doctor', 'retched', 'Josef', 'Mengele', 'actuality', 'Perl', 'saved', 'many', 'women', 'sacrificing', 'unborn', 'lives', 'fetuses', 'being', 'tricked', 'Mengele', 'submission', 'having', 'see', 'what', 'went', 'walls', 'Auschwitz', 'horrors', 'witnessed', 'Perl', 'survived', 'flourish', 'once', 'again', 'true', 'story', 'one', 'undying', 'spirit.Christina', 'Lahti', 'phenomenal', 'role', 'Gisella', 'Perl', 'capture', 'brokenness', 'strength', 'woman', 'equal', 'determination', 'Many', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'absolutely', 'gut-wrenching', 'entirely', 'important', 'stated', 'film', 'Auschwitz', 'became', 'own', 'country', 'rules', 'humanity', 'no', 'longer', 'applied', 'circumstances', 'many', 'atrocities', 'were', 'committed', 'Nazi', 'Jewish', 'prisoners', 'alike', 'who', 'say', 'what', 'human', 'being', 'can', 'reach', 'horror', 'Holocaust', 'order', 'thrive', 'conditions', 'faced', 'prisoners', 'were', 'forced', 'submit', 'then', 'be', 'burned', 'alive', 'calculate', 'way', 'living', 'Gisella', 'Perl', 'did', 'just', 'how', 'feel', 'abortions', 'woman', 'had', 'perform', 'procedures', 'bare', 'handed', 'intolerable', 'conditions', 'order', 'save', 'lives', 'women', 'prisoners', 'was', 'forced', 'threat', 'assist', 'experiments', 'Mengele', 'even', 'went', 'as', 'far', 'saving', 'female', 'Nazi', 'guard', 'own', 'predicament', 'question', 'Placed', 'same', 'circumstances', 'few', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'survived', 'so', 'leave', 'moral', 'judgments', 'one', 'Instead', 'one', 'woman', 'story', 'matter', 'so', 'ashes', 'Auschwitz', 'other', 'concentration', 'camps', 'never', 'establish', 'foothold', 'world', 'again']",Out of the Ashes
