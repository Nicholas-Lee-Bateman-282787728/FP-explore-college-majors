1441767,A1LH7YTNTWP6MT,B0054DPLSY,Andrew Furst,"[7, 7]","Easily one of the most exciting baseball games ever, great nostalgia too.  If you are interested in this game, you pretty much know what happened, I won't spoil the details.  Obviously there were a ton of runs scored.  Also of note, some of the best and most memorable players of the late 1970's/early 1980's participated in this game, including Mike Schmidt, Bill Buckner, Pete Rose, Dave Kingman, Tug McGraw, Bruce Sutter, Larry Bowa, and many more.  The Phillies were loaded with talent at this point, and went on to win the World Series the following season.  The Phillies had also won the day's previous game at Wrigley by a score of 13-0.  But the Cubs had a pretty good team themselves at this point, going 48-38 in the first half of 1979 before collapsing (naturally) in the second half to finish a disappointing 80-82.  On this sunny day in at beautiful Wrigley Field however, Cub fans were optimistic, as usual in mid May.  If you are a fan of the Cubs or Phillies of this era, or even just wish to experience the nostalgia of the late 1970's at Wrigley Field, this affordably priced DVD is for you.One thing I'll suggest is to not look at the back of the DVD case (prior to viewing the entire game), as it lists various highlights as well as presenting the inning-by-inning score of the game.  Regarding picture quality, it's actually surprisingly good for the era.  Obviously not remotely HD-quality, but the picture seems fairly comparable to what you'd have seen in 1979 if you watched it live, with perhaps some minor degradation due to time.  Although the picture does look slightly ""fuzzy"" (soft focus) from the outfield camera (showing the live view of the batter), this seems to have been as it was at that time - as the close up views from other cameras give you quite a sharp picture. Some of the time the reds seem pinkish, especially on the Phillies uniforms, although other times (from other camera angles) the reds are true deep red, so again this is likely simply the game as presented, rather than a problem of tape degradation. All in all though, it's more than watchable quality, really good for the era. The tv announcers are Jack Brickhouse (for all but 3 innings) and Lou Boudreau (for 3 innings), which adds to the nostalgia for Cubs fans.  Alternately, you can choose to listen to the Phillies radio broadcast as you watch the action, via a language option.  There's even a brief appearance by beloved college basketball coach Ray Meyer, and also by a Chicago Bulls player (John Mengelt) who speaks about a couple of young NBA prospects who'd just finished their college careers - Magic Johnson and Larry Bird!So what's the flaw here?  Well it's missing a tiny bit of the action.  There are two points (that I noticed) where the first pitch is not shown, you see what you think is the first pitch and then are told it's ""1 and 1"", or ""0 and 2"" or whatever.  Those two points don't matter much, BUT, there's a dramatic point in the game where Dave Kingman strides toward the batter's box as the next batter... and.... they don't show any of that at-bat!  Basically you see Kingman approaching the batter's box, and the next thing you see is Steve Ontiveros standing at the plate, ready to face his first pitch of his own at-bat.  Huh?  So an important, high-drama at-bat was missed entirely (other than the build-up ahead of it), and for that I'm dinging this by one star.  You can figure out what happened (sort of), but it would have been great to see that at-bat. There are no special features, save for the language options and ability to start at any half-inning you choose.  There's no post-game wrap-up, no years-after-the-fact interviews.  The game just starts (it does include some brief pre-game introductions) and then ends just a few moments after the last out.  But it's still great to see this, and at this price, no special features are needed.  Obviously the DVD makers would have loved to show that Kingman at-bat, but I assume it was lost for some reason, and it's better to see all this than nothing at all.  Thanks to MLB Properties, A&E; etc. for this well-done offering of a memorable game and time period.",4,Hugely entertaining - though one small flaw,1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,4161,"['Easily', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'baseball', 'games', 'ever', 'great', 'nostalgia', 'too', 'are', 'interested', 'game', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'details', 'Obviously', 'were', 'ton', 'runs', 'scored', 'Also', 'note', 'best', 'most', 'memorable', 'players', 'late', ""1970's/early"", '1980', 'participated', 'game', 'including', 'Mike', 'Schmidt', 'Bill', 'Buckner', 'Pete', 'Rose', 'Dave', 'Kingman', 'Tug', 'McGraw', 'Bruce', 'Sutter', 'Larry', 'Bowa', 'many', 'more', 'Phillies', 'were', 'loaded', 'talent', 'point', 'went', 'win', 'World', 'Series', 'following', 'season', 'Phillies', 'had', 'also', 'won', 'day', 'previous', 'game', 'Wrigley', 'score', '13-0', 'Cubs', 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'team', 'point', 'going', '48-38', 'first', 'half', '1979', 'collapsing', 'naturally', 'second', 'half', 'finish', 'disappointing', '80-82', 'sunny', 'day', 'beautiful', 'Wrigley', 'Field', 'however', 'Cub', 'fans', 'were', 'optimistic', 'usual', 'mid', 'May', 'are', 'fan', 'Cubs', 'Phillies', 'era', 'even', 'just', 'wish', 'experience', 'nostalgia', 'late', '1970', 'Wrigley', 'Field', 'affordably', 'priced', 'DVD', 'you.One', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'suggest', 'not', 'look', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'prior', 'viewing', 'entire', 'game', 'various', 'highlights', 'as', 'well', 'presenting', 'inning-by-inning', 'score', 'game', 'Regarding', 'picture', 'quality', 'actually', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'era', 'Obviously', 'not', 'remotely', 'HD-quality', 'picture', 'fairly', 'comparable', 'what', ""'d"", 'have', 'seen', '1979', 'watched', 'live', 'perhaps', 'minor', 'degradation', 'due', 'time', 'picture', 'look', 'slightly', 'fuzzy', 'soft', 'focus', 'outfield', 'camera', 'showing', 'live', 'view', 'batter', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'time', 'close', 'up', 'views', 'other', 'cameras', 'give', 'quite', 'sharp', 'picture', 'time', 'reds', 'seem', 'pinkish', 'especially', 'Phillies', 'uniforms', 'other', 'times', 'other', 'camera', 'angles', 'reds', 'are', 'true', 'deep', 'red', 'so', 'again', 'likely', 'simply', 'game', 'presented', 'rather', 'problem', 'tape', 'degradation', 'more', 'watchable', 'quality', 'really', 'good', 'era', 'tv', 'announcers', 'are', 'Jack', 'Brickhouse', '3', 'innings', 'Lou', 'Boudreau', '3', 'innings', 'nostalgia', 'Cubs', 'fans', 'Alternately', 'can', 'choose', 'listen', 'Phillies', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'watch', 'action', 'language', 'option', 'even', 'brief', 'appearance', 'beloved', 'college', 'basketball', 'coach', 'Ray', 'Meyer', 'also', 'Chicago', 'Bulls', 'player', 'John', 'Mengelt', 'who', 'couple', 'young', 'NBA', 'prospects', 'who', ""'d"", 'just', 'finished', 'college', 'careers', 'Magic', 'Johnson', 'Larry', 'Bird', 'So', 'what', 'flaw', 'here', 'Well', 'missing', 'tiny', 'bit', 'action', 'are', 'two', 'points', 'noticed', 'where', 'first', 'pitch', 'not', 'shown', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'first', 'pitch', 'then', 'are', 'told', '1', '1', '0', '2', 'two', 'points', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much', 'BUT', 'dramatic', 'point', 'game', 'where', 'Dave', 'Kingman', 'batter', 'box', 'next', 'batter', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'at-bat', 'Basically', 'see', 'Kingman', 'approaching', 'batter', 'box', 'next', 'thing', 'see', 'Steve', 'Ontiveros', 'standing', 'plate', 'ready', 'face', 'first', 'pitch', 'own', 'at-bat', 'Huh', 'important', 'high-drama', 'at-bat', 'was', 'missed', 'entirely', 'other', 'build-up', 'ahead', ""'m"", 'dinging', 'one', 'star', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'sort', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'see', 'at-bat', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'save', 'language', 'options', 'ability', 'start', 'half-inning', 'choose', 'post-game', 'wrap-up', 'years-after-the-fact', 'interviews', 'game', 'just', 'include', 'brief', 'pre-game', 'introductions', 'then', 'just', 'few', 'moments', 'last', 'out', 'still', 'great', 'see', 'price', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'needed', 'Obviously', 'DVD', 'makers', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'show', 'Kingman', 'at-bat', 'assume', 'was', 'lost', 'reason', 'better', 'see', 'nothing', 'Thanks', 'MLB', 'Properties', 'A', 'E', 'etc', 'well-done', 'offering', 'memorable', 'game', 'time', 'period']",Baseball’s Greatest Games: 1979 Wrigley Field Slugfest

1441769,A2IS16K96YSFDV,B0054DPLSY,Eric Mayforth,"[2, 2]","In the summer of 1977 I was nearly seven and old enough to start noticing and becoming interested in sports.  In my small town in Southwest Michigan, we could pick up WGN from across the lake and I became a big Chicago Cubs fan.  All Cubs home games were played during the day then and were all televised by WGN, and during the months of baseball season that school was in session I'd frequently watch the last few innings when I got home.Thursday, May 17, 1979 was no ordinary day, though--when I turned on the TV, I couldn't believe that the Cubs were down 21-9 to the Phillies.  Even as a third grader, I knew I was watching a game I'd never forget as my team clawed its way back into it, tying the game at 22-22 before finally falling 23-22 in ten innings.I was thrilled to see the game available on DVD.  It seems that there were many other Cubs-Phillies slugfests at Wrigley Field in the late Seventies and early Eighties (I distinctly recall a 12-11 Cubs win in June 1982), but none of them compared to this contest.  I later learned that the score was 7-6 after the first inning, which neither starting pitcher survived.  Bill Buckner and Dave Kingman were two of my favorite players then, and they both had huge days, and Mike Schmidt and Pete Rose came up big for Philadelphia that day.While watching the game you can choose between hearing the Phillies' radio broadcast or the Cubs' television broadcast.  Jack Brickhouse was a great announcer for the Cubs, and it was great to hear his ""Hey Hey!"" home run call after all these years.  At one point in the broadcast, Brickhouse said that ""we've got ourselves a real marathon""...in the third inning when the score was 11-6 and less than 40 percent of the runs had been scored.  This game definitely had a late Seventies feel, too, with the powder blue road uniforms that were en vogue at the time, and in a couple of spots you can even hear typewriters clicking away in the background in the press box.  It was also interesting to recall Wrigley Field minus some of the bells and whistles that exist today.I can recall looking at the outrageous box score in the paper the next day and may even have cut it out, knowing it was a game to remember.  Even today, when you type ""Cubs Phillies"" into Internet search engines, two of the leading suggestions offered are ""23-22"" and ""1979.""  It was a treat to finally watch the game in its entirety a third of a century later, and even though I knew the final outcome, while watching the late innings I found myself wishing that the Cubs could have pulled out a win in this classic.",5,NEVER Thought I'd See This Again,1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,2583,"['summer', '1977', 'was', 'nearly', 'seven', 'old', 'enough', 'start', 'noticing', 'becoming', 'interested', 'sports', 'small', 'town', 'Southwest', 'Michigan', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'WGN', 'lake', 'became', 'big', 'Chicago', 'Cubs', 'fan', 'Cubs', 'home', 'games', 'were', 'played', 'day', 'then', 'were', 'televised', 'WGN', 'months', 'baseball', 'season', 'school', 'was', 'session', ""'d"", 'frequently', 'watch', 'last', 'few', 'innings', 'when', 'got', 'home.Thursday', 'May', '17', '1979', 'was', 'ordinary', 'day', 'though', 'when', 'turned', 'TV', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Cubs', 'were', 'down', '21-9', 'Phillies', 'Even', 'third', 'grader', 'knew', 'was', 'watching', 'game', ""'d"", 'never', 'forget', 'team', 'clawed', 'way', 'back', 'tying', 'game', '22-22', 'finally', 'falling', '23-22', 'ten', 'innings.I', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'game', 'available', 'DVD', 'were', 'many', 'other', 'Cubs-Phillies', 'slugfests', 'Wrigley', 'Field', 'late', 'Seventies', 'early', 'Eighties', 'distinctly', 'recall', '12-11', 'Cubs', 'win', 'June', '1982', 'none', 'compared', 'contest', 'later', 'learned', 'score', 'was', '7-6', 'first', 'inning', 'starting', 'pitcher', 'survived', 'Bill', 'Buckner', 'Dave', 'Kingman', 'were', 'two', 'favorite', 'players', 'then', 'had', 'huge', 'days', 'Mike', 'Schmidt', 'Pete', 'Rose', 'came', 'up', 'big', 'Philadelphia', 'watching', 'game', 'can', 'choose', 'hearing', 'Phillies', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'Cubs', 'television', 'broadcast', 'Jack', 'Brickhouse', 'was', 'great', 'announcer', 'Cubs', 'was', 'great', 'hear', 'Hey', 'Hey', 'home', 'run', 'call', 'years', 'one', 'point', 'broadcast', 'Brickhouse', 'said', ""'ve"", 'got', 'real', 'marathon', 'third', 'inning', 'when', 'score', 'was', '11-6', 'less', '40', 'percent', 'runs', 'had', 'been', 'scored', 'game', 'definitely', 'had', 'late', 'Seventies', 'feel', 'too', 'powder', 'blue', 'road', 'uniforms', 'were', 'en', 'vogue', 'time', 'couple', 'spots', 'can', 'even', 'hear', 'typewriters', 'clicking', 'away', 'background', 'press', 'box', 'was', 'also', 'interesting', 'recall', 'Wrigley', 'Field', 'minus', 'bells', 'whistles', 'exist', 'today.I', 'can', 'recall', 'looking', 'outrageous', 'box', 'score', 'paper', 'next', 'day', 'may', 'even', 'have', 'cut', 'out', 'knowing', 'was', 'game', 'remember', 'Even', 'today', 'when', 'type', 'Cubs', 'Phillies', 'Internet', 'search', 'engines', 'two', 'leading', 'suggestions', 'offered', 'are', '23-22', '1979', 'was', 'treat', 'finally', 'watch', 'game', 'entirety', 'third', 'century', 'later', 'even', 'knew', 'final', 'outcome', 'watching', 'late', 'innings', 'found', 'wishing', 'Cubs', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'out', 'win', 'classic']",Baseball’s Greatest Games: 1979 Wrigley Field Slugfest
