I admit, that Kutcher's acting and directing of the movie is great, but the story itself is missing the thrill which you get from the book.

Jobs is portrayed as part madman, part prophet and sage.There are plenty of moments in the movie that are enjoyable -- particularly the &#34;early days&#34; with Woz et al. -- but the movie drags on and on with its quasi-Messianic tones.The end of the movie was anti-climactic... tragic, perhaps. It doesn't develop Jobs fully such that we can cheer for the man who got back the company he loved and lost. It doesn't show how he grew wiser, calmer, and more patient in the process. It doesn't show how he tried to master his own demons. There's no redemption; no personal growth. (A movie that takes artistic license with history should at least improve the story.)

It's not quite a classical biography or documentary either, as there is no narration or third party interviews. The movie covers Jobs from college to first iPod announcement in 2001, and during this time only parts of his life that is relevant to his endeavor to create (Atari game, Apple I board, Apple II, LISA, first Macintosh). The movie skipped entire stint at NeXT and jumped to his return to Apple and begin instill his philosophy for new Mac and into consumer devices.For general audience, the film will come across bunch of short films concatenated. Each transition (screen black out) may be few months or few years later. For those not familiar with the timeline of events, it may be tough to following as there are no mention of which year after each scene jump. This have bother some people as evident in the reviews from general public.Personally, I enjoyed the viewing. This is probably because 1) I get to be nostalgic and relive the early personal computers from the first Apple II / TRS-80 rivalry, to the intro of Mac challenging IBM PC, and onward. Second is because I am an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley and can relate to everything Jobs have gone through - from garage start-up to first venture funding to first trade show to company growing big to turmoils, investor demands, and board battles.In addition to the above two reasons, I think this movie will also resonate with audience that are:1. Genuinely admire/curious Steve Jobs (or really in awe of the Apple products under him)2. Very interested in how Apple came about3. Want insights on going from ""garage start-ups"" to big time in the early days of techI don't know Steve Jobs so I am neutral on Aston Kutcher's portrayl of him. But those that have interacted with him might have strong feelings one way or the other. With that said, I can see Aston Kutcher took the acting role seriously. In general, this kind of ""biopic"" film it is seldom completely accurate. It's more for audience to get the gist of it, so take it for what it is.In summary, it's not a movie to entertain but rather to give some insights.

Making a film on a famous figure such as Jobs is a daunting task and it is almost impossible to capture all the various facets of the multi talented man who was brilliant and short lived in a movie that is only two hours long. Social Network was an example of a movie about the creation of Facebook and David Fincher came close to making a perfect movie. Jobs had a life that many complexities and it was not ordinary by any standards...he was adopted, could not adjust to societal rules due to his callous behavior even to close friends and kin. The brilliance and cruelty of the man is very briefly touched , so are his many achievements in a film that can only serve as a basic introduction to the man called Steve Jobs.The director Joshua Michael Stern makes an abridged version of Jobs life without giving any deep insights in character and personality if that suits you then this is a good film but if you are looking for deeper insight - you must wait and hope that the upcoming  Adam Sorkin directed drama gets it right.The naysayers who thought that Ashton Kucher would not be right fit as Jobs should be somewhat satisfied as Kucher relishes the role as Jobs, he brings the right amount of youthfulness and maturity. I thought Kucher did well.This is an ok film as there as so many fundamental  details in Jobs life that needed to be analyzed so that we would have been able to understand Jobs the man and the film just failed to do so...Such as1. Why was Jobs so callous to his daughter and how did they make up years later?2. Who is the woman that becomes his wife?3. His relationship with his parents?The only time I thought Jobs had some some humanity was during his interaction with Steve Wozniak as he plans his departure from Apple Computer.Still I enjoyed it and some of you might as well.",4,A decent Job,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,1952,"['think', 'biographical', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'hard', 'make', 'makers', 'can', 'safely', 'assume', 'matter', 'what', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'please', 'anyone', 'Making', 'film', 'famous', 'figure', 'such', 'Jobs', 'daunting', 'task', 'almost', 'impossible', 'capture', 'various', 'facets', 'multi', 'talented', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'brilliant', 'short', 'lived', 'movie', 'only', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'Social', 'Network', 'was', 'example', 'movie', 'creation', 'Facebook', 'David', 'Fincher', 'came', 'close', 'making', 'perfect', 'movie', 'Jobs', 'had', 'life', 'many', 'complexities', 'was', 'not', 'ordinary', 'standards', 'was', 'adopted', 'could', 'not', 'adjust', 'societal', 'rules', 'due', 'callous', 'behavior', 'even', 'close', 'friends', 'kin', 'brilliance', 'cruelty', 'man', 'very', 'briefly', 'touched', 'so', 'are', 'many', 'achievements', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'serve', 'basic', 'introduction', 'man', 'called', 'Steve', 'Jobs.The', 'director', 'Joshua', 'Michael', 'Stern', 'abridged', 'version', 'Jobs', 'life', 'giving', 'deep', 'insights', 'character', 'personality', 'suits', 'then', 'good', 'film', 'are', 'looking', 'deeper', 'insight', 'must', 'wait', 'hope', 'upcoming', 'Adam', 'Sorkin', 'directed', 'drama', 'right.The', 'naysayers', 'who', 'thought', 'Ashton', 'Kucher', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'right', 'fit', 'Jobs', 'should', 'be', 'somewhat', 'satisfied', 'Kucher', 'role', 'Jobs', 'right', 'amount', 'youthfulness', 'maturity', 'thought', 'Kucher', 'did', 'well.This', 'ok', 'film', 'as', 'there', 'so', 'many', 'fundamental', 'details', 'Jobs', 'life', 'needed', 'be', 'analyzed', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'understand', 'Jobs', 'man', 'film', 'just', 'failed', 'do', 'so', 'Such', 'as1', 'Why', 'was', 'Jobs', 'so', 'callous', 'daughter', 'how', 'did', 'make', 'up', 'years', 'later', '2', 'Who', 'woman', 'wife', '3', 'relationship', 'parents', 'only', 'time', 'thought', 'Jobs', 'had', 'humanity', 'was', 'interaction', 'Steve', 'Wozniak', 'departure', 'Apple', 'Computer.Still', 'enjoyed', 'might', 'as', 'well']",N/A
1629368,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00BEIYL6G,Anthony L.,"[58, 65]","I'm surprised I liked JOBS as much as I did, considering that the reviews surrounding the film were mediocre at best, not to mention that Ashton Kutcher is one of my least favourite actors EVER. Much to my surprise, Kutcher was actually astonishingly good in the title role.Take him out, and you are left with a limp, unfocused, poorly paced, and incredibly boring biopic. Put him back in, and you are still left with the above, but with a daring and riveting performance at its centre.Now, this is isn't saying much, but this is Kutcher's best performance by about 300%. He absolutely *nails* Steve Jobs's mannerisms - his stooped walk, the way he held his hands in front of him, the way he pursed his lips, etc. He holds surprising gravitas and charisma, and holds up excellently in scenery-chewing moments. The scenes where he brutally rejects the woman he impregnated, and gives Bill Gates a piece of his mind (""And I will make sure you NEVER earn a dollar again, that I don't get 90 cents from!"") show a different, extremely competent side of the actor. The material surrounding him might be rote and unfeeling, but Kutcher has steel in his gaze and power in his presence.It's a pity then, that JOBS is unfocused in it's storytelling, in need of a damn good edit, uninformative, and rather dull. No really, at times this was one of the most boring films I've ever seen. The scene where Wozniak leaves Apple should have been emotional and heartrending, but nearly put me to sleep. I would rather have had more fun reading up on infections of the large intestine.Jobs had scenes that had no impact whatsoever on the film - extraneous, useless scenes that do nothing that bore the audience. 90% of the movie are actors talking quietly (or loudly) to each-other - just talking. Talking WELL, yes, but still talking. And lastly, JOBS is incredibly uninformative. We get nothing about WHY Apple became big, how it sustained losses through tough times, really WHY Steve Jobs was fired, subsequently rehired, and how Apple recovered.JOBS is not without it's positives, however. The first I went over above - the performance of Ashton Kutcher. The rest of the cast is rather excellent as well. Josh Gad as Steve Wozniak is enjoyable, and JK Simmons chews scenery as Arthur Rock. The costumes and wigs are excellent. The period design is incredible - from the terrible hairdos to the tacky suits to the giant computers. I never felt that I was anywhere else but in the 70's and 80's. Kudos to the the production designer.In conclusion, I don't think Steve Jobs would have been very happy with JOBS. It's not daring enough. It never strives for something edgy or dangerous. It is content to roll along at documentary pace, with poor editing and dull pacing.But I still think you should see this movie. See it for an extraordinary performance from Ashton Kutcher, a fine cast, and excellent production values. See it to remember a great man. A difficult man; a daring, edgy, cruel, prickly, brilliant man: Steve Jobs. 3.5/5 Stars, rounded up to 4.Here's to the Crazy Ones.PS: Remember that the like/dislike buttons are not for saying whether you agree or disagree with the reviewer, but whether the review helped you make a decision to use the product or not.

The presentation was boring, Ashton Kutcher's performance was terrible, and after watching the movie and reading up on the feedback from the actual people represented in the movie, it sounds very inaccurate too.First off, I think there's a lot of room to make this movie very exciting. You have a character that can be hated and loved at the same time, you have betrayal from many directions, you interesting competitors etc and yet somehow they still manage to make it boring. Everything just felt bland. If there's one thing good I can say is that it's cohesive (e.g. it doesn't just jump the timeline for no reason) but apart from that, it was super boring. The first 10-15 minutes or so (or what felt like a lifetime) of where Jobs went to college and then India was so extremely boring and added absolutely zero to the movie. If I didn't respect Jobs as much as I do, I'd probably would've turned off the movie then.As for Ashton Kutcher's performance, it was extremely weak. I mean the times he acted angry, you just sit there and go &#34;really?&#34;. It felt extremely fake and it was no different when he acted sad, all you could do was *facepalm* at it. He completely overdid it. I admit, there were maybe a few moments when his performance was decent but overall 90% of the time you kind of just want him to get kicked out of the movie.One thing I hate more than anything in a biopic, is if it's inaccurate. After watching the movie I decided to check up on it's accuracy and lo and behold, it was pretty much said to be completely inaccurate portrayals of the characters. Woz being the harshest and Kottke the nicest. Let's just say that Kottke (who was a consultant on the film) said &#34;By the time it got to the fourth draft, it was okay. It wasn't making me cringe&#34;. I mean if the nicest thing you can say is that it wasn't terrible, then you know it's pretty bad.I encourage people to watch some of the other movies instead of this boring garbage. You'll save yourself a lot of time. Pirates of The Silicon Valley gives a more accurate portrayal of the characters but the story might jump around a bit as it tries to tell the tale of both Apple and Microsoft.

Again, I don't know how true it was, but all I knew was that Jobs was one of the founders, got the boot and came back to the helm until he got sick.  But for a company that was supposedly based on positive ideals, things got UGLY at Apple (at least, that's what they movie shows).So, while it's probably a thumbnail sketch of Jobs's story, it's a fun tale to watch for anyone who wants a glimpse into a company that brought about a lot of technology that re-defined our lives.

1629392,A2XXBZPQT5EXHV,B00BEIYL6G,Darren O'Neill,"[1, 2]","I was a bit skeptical going into this movie that Ashton Kutcher could carry the role of Steve Jobs.  His performance surprised me and showed me that Kutcher has more acting chops than he normally uses in the sitcom settings we normally get to see him in.For the Apple purists out there this film may not be 100% accurate and since it only lasts about two hours there are obviously things that are left out.  With that said I really enjoyed the movie.  It hit the big points well, covering both the starting of Apple and Jobs eventual removal from the company.The movie shows Jobs for what he was, a visionary that often let his quest for the best product in the world erode his relationships with his family, friends and co-workers.  Kutcher seemed equally comfortable portraying Jobs highs and lows, from the yelling, screaming manic leader of a tech giant to the broken man that winds up crying back in the garage where Apple was created many years prior.I grew up during the Apple revolution and had an Apple IIe.

1629394,A13PPQ2GI1IJYM,B00BEIYL6G,DESERTMAN40,"[0, 0]","Jobs is a biographical film about the late Steve Jobs,the founder of Apple Computer. The time line of the film includes from his hippie days in the 1970's to his return to Apple as CEO to help the company rise from the brink of bankruptcy and leading them to becoming worth almost $500 Billion and become the most valuable company of the United States.After watching the film myself,I was extremely disappointed that we never got to know more about Steve Jobs the person but the screenplay focused more on the history of Apple Computers.Despite the fact that it provides the viewers a great deal of information with regards to his professional history from his days to Atari up to his days to becoming the head of Apple,there were many episodes in his life that were left behind like his activities at Pixar and NEXT.Added to that,we never got to see what made him become a great leader that helped his workers achieve great results.Was it his charisma or better yet was he competent tyrant?It never provides that answer.What we are treated to in this film is the rise of Apple from its humble beginnings to becoming one of the prominent companies in the world.Also,we get to see how Jobs manages to help the company to resurrect from the brink of filing bankruptcy into becoming the most valuable company in the country after his return to the company in 1997.His personal life is barely addressed at all like his adoption,his relationship with Steve Wozniak, his arrogance, and the sudden changes that happened to him later in his life.Also,we don't get to learn more about his rivalry with Bill Gates except when he yelled at him over the phone. It was definitely a missed opportunity.What's worse, Ashton Kutcher's lack of acting ability is in full display. Despite the fact that he tried his best to look like Jobs and acquire his mannerisms for the film,his portrayal of the man was can be classified as incoherent and clumsy.He acts like a lunatic instead of someone who is man that is highly emotional and characterized by an unstable personality.In the end,one would only hope that there would be a better biopic released about Steve Jobs in the future.",2,A Missed Opportunity,1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,2162,"['Jobs', 'biographical', 'film', 'late', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'founder', 'Apple', 'Computer', 'time', 'line', 'film', 'hippie', 'days', '1970', 'return', 'Apple', 'CEO', 'help', 'company', 'rise', 'brink', 'bankruptcy', 'leading', 'becoming', 'worth', 'almost', '500', 'Billion', 'become', 'most', 'valuable', 'company', 'United', 'States.After', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'never', 'got', 'know', 'more', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'person', 'screenplay', 'focused', 'more', 'history', 'Apple', 'Computers.Despite', 'fact', 'viewers', 'great', 'deal', 'information', 'regards', 'professional', 'history', 'days', 'Atari', 'up', 'days', 'becoming', 'head', 'Apple', 'were', 'many', 'episodes', 'life', 'were', 'left', 'activities', 'Pixar', 'NEXT.Added', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'what', 'made', 'become', 'great', 'leader', 'helped', 'workers', 'achieve', 'great', 'results.Was', 'charisma', 'better', 'yet', 'was', 'competent', 'tyrant', 'never', 'are', 'treated', 'film', 'rise', 'Apple', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'becoming', 'one', 'prominent', 'companies', 'world.Also', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Jobs', 'help', 'company', 'resurrect', 'brink', 'filing', 'bankruptcy', 'becoming', 'most', 'valuable', 'company', 'country', 'return', 'company', '1997.His', 'personal', 'life', 'barely', 'addressed', 'adoption', 'relationship', 'Steve', 'Wozniak', 'arrogance', 'sudden', 'changes', 'happened', 'later', 'life.Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'learn', 'more', 'rivalry', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'when', 'yelled', 'phone', 'was', 'definitely', 'missed', 'opportunity.What', 'worse', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'lack', 'acting', 'ability', 'full', 'display', 'fact', 'tried', 'best', 'look', 'Jobs', 'acquire', 'mannerisms', 'film', 'portrayal', 'man', 'was', 'can', 'be', 'classified', 'incoherent', 'clumsy.He', 'acts', 'lunatic', 'instead', 'someone', 'who', 'man', 'highly', 'emotional', 'characterized', 'unstable', 'personality.In', 'end', 'one', 'would', 'only', 'hope', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'biopic', 'released', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'future']",N/A

You don't get to see what it is that changes his mind set and way of life, but he comes back a much calmer and more amiable person.

1629401,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BEIYL6G,FNDNreview,"[29, 35]","A great many words can be used to describe the late Steve Jobs.  Atop the list, you'd probably find innovator and visionary, followed by several harsher words that there's no need to use here.  His contributions to the technology industry are undeniable, and while he clearly had a life full of conflict, history will always remember him as the man that started a technology revolution by co-founding the multi-billion dollar company, Apple.  Today, a rough estimate projects Apple to be worth in the ballpark of $600-700 billion.  And, the odds are (since you're reading this) that you probably own a piece of technology that Steve Jobs oversaw at one point - whether it's an iPhone, iPod, Mac, or one of several other forms of Apple technology.  For all his flaws and rocky relationships, Steve Jobs managed to found a company, lose his place in it, and come back to make it bigger and better than ever.  These real life events are chronicled in the biopic, Jobs.Directed by Joshua Michael Stern (Swing Vote), Jobs stars Ashton Kutcher as the ambitious technology marketer, Steve Jobs.  The film begins with Steve Jobs introducing the iPod in 2001, and quickly shifting to his free spiritedness as a young man during his college years.  After dropping out, Steve becomes involved with Steve Wozniak - a tech guru that has been working on a personal computer.  Together, Jobs and Wozniak - along with a handful of others, begin their quest to build a company, called Apple, from the ground up.  After the initial success of Apple, business and egos come into play as Jobs struggles to find his way in his own company.  J.K. Simmons, Matthew Modine, and Lukas Hass also star in supporting roles.At first, Ashton Kutcher feels like an odd choice to portray Steve Jobs.  However, Kutcher will eventually grow on you, despite his slightly irritating attempt to emulate Steve Jobs' ticks and movements.  Drama is not Kutcher's strong suit, and probably never will be, but that doesn't mean his portrayal of Jobs is any less entertaining.  For the people that actually knew Jobs, it's their job (no pun intended) to nitpick about whether this is an honest portrayal of the actual man himself.  Jobs' death was only a short two years ago, so there's plenty of tape out there that Kutcher had the ability to study.  Regardless, it's pretty safe to say Kutcher's portrayal of the driven, yet easily angry innovator is not so much of a questionable acting job as it is a question of whether or not Jobs was portrayed honestly and fairly.  To the people that produced this film, they'll say Kutcher was right on the money.  Others that actually worked with Jobs have criticized Kutcher's portrayal as being a bit off.  In any event, and as far as this film goes, Kutcher's portrayal provides for high entertainment value (which is the point of a film) - especially in specific scenes, including one in which he's chewing out Bill Gates' voicemail.Like all biopics, it's difficult to fully incorporate every meaningful moment of someone's life in two hours.  Jobs starts at a point that allows Kutcher to pass as a young college student, frankly because he still looks like a twenty year old (and usually acts like one in most of his roles, too).  From there, this film covers the most groundbreaking and strenuous moments of Jobs' life, including the moment he chose to avoid his responsibility as a parent and his constant battles with Apple's Board of Directors.  Sadly, this script (penned by Matt Whiteley) is notable for all of things that it doesn't include, instead of the moments it does include.  The most difficult moments in the final years of his life - fighting cancer - are completely avoided, leaving years of emotional experiences out of the film.Today, people know Steve Jobs for his involvement overseeing modern technology.  However, these technical works of art and their worldwide success are only touched upon briefly (except the iPhone), while the majority of the film focuses on Jobs' spats with the people around him and his supposed ""flaws.""  Kutcher's portrayal leaves Steve Jobs looking like a man that had all the ideas and had everything figured out, but in reality he had very little to do with the actual implementation of Apple products.  He spent most of his time perfecting and then marketing other people's work - a point several former employees, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak are on record pointing out.The supporting cast is also quite enjoyable, featuring Josh Gad as Steve Wozniak - a portrayal that is slightly inaccurate as it portrays Jobs as more a commanding figure in their friendship when that wasn't necessarily always the case.  Still, Gad does an excellent job depicting Wozniak, despite the implication that Wozniak was nothing more than a sidekick.  And, if a film needs to have a corporate villain, there's really no one better to play the part than J.K. Simmons - portraying Arthur Rock.  In the film, Rock is the Apple Board member that outmaneuvers Steve Jobs and pushes him out of his role of power, leading to Jobs' resignation from Apple.  Simmons, like the real life Rock, perceived Jobs as a ticking time bomb and felt it was better to push him out before he sank the ship.  Naturally, we now know Jobs was the saving grace and removing him from power is what fast-tracked Apple to its desperate decline before Jobs eventually rejoined the company in 1996.Overall, Jobs is an opinionated film that depicts Steve Jobs as a bit of an evil genius that had a great deal of vision, but didn't know how to maintain working relationships.  True or not, this depiction of Jobs makes for interesting filmmaking, and will inspire viewers to do their own investigating into the man that helped revolutionize personal technology.  Ashton Kutcher is sustaining in his role as Steve Jobs, carrying the role from Jobs' college years through to the 1997 ""Think different"" advertising campaign.  However the film leaves out a great many important moments in the life of Steve Jobs, and includes several falsities.  While this is only one film's version of Jobs' life, it still tells an entertaining, made for Hollywood story of how Jobs was perceived during the years of Apple's formation and beyond.  But, the contributions of Steve Jobs are undeniably important, making it difficult to say what the world would look like today if Jobs were not the man he turned out to be.Grade:

It is, in essence, a fictional drama stitched together with a base of factual characters and events.  In fact it's clear that's the case since we all feel like we know heaps about Steve Jobs thanks to his very very public persona.Overall Ashton Kutcher does an excellent job of portraying Jobs; he does fall a little short in my mind, the accent was good but just not quite right, the explosive anger spilled out well but this was Steve's well-known nuclear option wielded to great effect and the film's character spilled forth like a mini Krakatoa but did not convince that it was the wrath of an angered demi-god on the edge of spitting your soul which is how I'd been led to believe it felt to be on the withering end of a Jobs' tirade.The scenes around the conception and younger years of Lisa, Steve's first child felt like they were paid lip-service in some ways and perhaps it's the geek in me that wanted it to either be the foundation of why Steve became who he was or to prop up some fundamental turning point in his life.  Instead the movie hints at this awkwardly and confuses the early hippy years, trips to Indian swamis and calligraphy classes in a way that seemed a bit like an area of script that was heavily edited for time and as a result left knotted into a bit of a mess that did not help bolster the rest of the film.Josh Gad's Woz is the right amount of awkward and soft-hearted obtuse-thinking boffin which is how I perceive the real Steve Wozniak to be.  Dermot Mulroney played a blindingly good and convincing performance as Mike Markkula so much so it almost became a mini ""my time with Apple"" biopic of the great man.For all the actors it must have been extremely intimidating to play any of the characters since they are so well known and many many hours of footage exists of them with virtually every Apple geek in the world feeling like they know their every nuance.  A very tough thing to do.  I think it worked.Overall a good even-paced movie but probably not one you're going to rave about.  For Apple fans like myself - a MUST HAVE and must see movie.

Especially, the beginning and ending is sort of inspiring to fellow entrepreneurs and dreamers to always keep innovating. It would have been enlightening to have seen some more of the deeper details and reasons for some things such as why he had such a drive. JOBS was mostly an overview of early Apple, so this would have been a good part 1, although there probably won't be a part 2 of this JOBS, thus four stars. It could have included more from scene one in 2001 until 2011 at the end of JOBS, and it did not.

His departure is wrenching.* Lukas Haas (""Lincoln"" and he was the little Amish boy in ""Witness"") is Daniel Kottke, the long-time friend who did drugs with Jobs during their Reed College days and went to India with him.* Matthew Modine (""The Dark Knight Rises"") is John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to bring a friendly face into the board room.* John Getz (""Blood Simple"") is Paul, Steve's father, whose garage workroom they used to build their first 500 circuit boards.* J.K.

If I had not been a captive in my narrow, uncomfortable seat for many hours I may not have otherwise chosen to watch the film. Since I live in Silicon Valley, and have known many people who worked at Apple, I feel I already know the story of Steve Jobs. Nonetheless, I was riveted by Kutcher's spot-on performance. There is plenty of imagery and video available to document Jobs' style and mannerisms, and it is obvious that Kutcher did his homework and studied the man extensively. Beyond the physical resemblance, the tight, controlled posture and speech patterns were mimicked by Kutcher to an almost uncanny degree. In some of the early, youthful scenes I thought maybe the director had used actual historical footage of Jobs. Kutcher has appeared in many light-weight, comedic roles, but this singular performance will surely elevate his status and put him in consideration for other more serious acting roles.Beyond the acting, however, the film is curiously emotionless and fragmented, leaving some major plot lines incomplete. We see Jobs dismissing the mother of his first child, but some time later we see him as an apparently happy family man. We see him threaten Bill Gates with legal action, but it's never mentioned again. The departure of Wozniak is almost a footnote. The ending is abrupt, omitting the final chapter of Jobs' life altogether. With a better script and direction, coupled with Kutcher's astonishing performance, this could have been a 5-star film with broad audience appeal since Jobs is already well on his way to becoming a legendary figure in American history.",3,Jobs - The Unfinished Life,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,1658,"['watched', 'movie', 'long', 'plane', 'trip', 'SFO', 'Sydney', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'captive', 'narrow', 'uncomfortable', 'seat', 'many', 'hours', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'otherwise', 'chosen', 'watch', 'film', 'live', 'Silicon', 'Valley', 'have', 'known', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'Apple', 'feel', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'Nonetheless', 'was', 'riveted', 'Kutcher', 'spot-on', 'performance', 'plenty', 'imagery', 'video', 'available', 'document', 'Jobs', 'style', 'mannerisms', 'obvious', 'Kutcher', 'did', 'homework', 'studied', 'man', 'extensively', 'physical', 'resemblance', 'tight', 'controlled', 'posture', 'speech', 'patterns', 'were', 'mimicked', 'Kutcher', 'almost', 'uncanny', 'degree', 'early', 'youthful', 'scenes', 'thought', 'maybe', 'director', 'had', 'used', 'actual', 'historical', 'footage', 'Jobs', 'Kutcher', 'appeared', 'many', 'light-weight', 'comedic', 'roles', 'singular', 'performance', 'will', 'surely', 'elevate', 'status', 'put', 'consideration', 'other', 'more', 'serious', 'acting', 'roles.Beyond', 'acting', 'however', 'film', 'curiously', 'emotionless', 'fragmented', 'leaving', 'major', 'plot', 'lines', 'incomplete', 'see', 'Jobs', 'dismissing', 'mother', 'first', 'child', 'time', 'later', 'see', 'apparently', 'happy', 'family', 'man', 'see', 'threaten', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'legal', 'action', 'never', 'mentioned', 'again', 'departure', 'Wozniak', 'almost', 'footnote', 'ending', 'abrupt', 'omitting', 'final', 'chapter', 'Jobs', 'life', 'altogether', 'better', 'script', 'direction', 'coupled', 'Kutcher', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'could', 'have', 'been', '5-star', 'film', 'broad', 'audience', 'appeal', 'Jobs', 'already', 'well', 'way', 'becoming', 'legendary', 'figure', 'American', 'history']",N/A

Kutcher does an amazing job as Jobs (no pun intended)--he's stubborn in some scenes and breaks down in others.  The title character doesn't come off as likable at all, but the role demanded a lot from Kutcher, and he delivered.The most heartbreaking scenes were when he turns his back on his pregnant girlfriend, and when Wozniak leaves Apple--both showed a sort of hardness that was a far cry from &#34;That 70's Show&#34;.  In the first, Jobs refutes paternity of his unborn child, coldly refusing to talk to his girlfriend, but privately erupting into a burst of anger and frustration--seemingly directed at himself.  In the latter scene, Jobs is working late in the deserted Apple headquarters when Wozniak interrupts him to inform Jobs that he's quit Apple; Jobs shows little emotion for his friend and it turns into more of a monologue between Wozniak and the audience.While we're on the subject, Wozniak is the one who I really rooted for in this movie, even though he was relegated to more of a sidekick role for the greater part of the film...in the movie, he was the likable and comedic foil to Jobs' stubborn and unyielding leader, but even as a relative tech outsider, I get that there was probably more of a story there than what was observed in the film.  Can we have a movie about him?The storyline itself was pretty disjointed--it began with his college years and ends with the iPod launch, with some parts in between more or less skipped over.

Then I realized: I'm not pressing ""pause"" OR ""stop""! That says something good about this film. I'm sure there are lots of things that aren't accurate, and they can be annoying or distracting. But this is a movie, not a documentary. The alternative to its having some ""inaccuracies"" is to not have this movie at all, as it's impossible to make a 100% true-to-fact biopic. As for me, I am glad this movie was made, and I think it's smart and well-conceived.The above statement aside, I am a detail person. I notice things like right/left handedness and the changes in style of jeans, including Levi's. But if you get hung up on these kinds of things, you will not be able to enjoy this very good film.There is a lot of criticism about the film from people who know more about Jobs than I do. Like not having anything in it about Pixar. I watched/listened to the directors commentary and learned that this film was intended to be about Apple. Perhaps it should have been titled ""Apple,"" unless maybe that name was taken by some other movie.You have to come to terms with the knowledge that this movie was made from a point of view. It's not intended to be a film version of an encyclopedia article.That said, I saw somewhere that Steve Wozniak has had some criticisms about the accuracy of the movie, especially the roles of and conversations between himself and Jobs. Now, those comments might be worth a listen.I rented this movie from one of those tardis-like red kiosks. After watching it, I wanted to watch the commentary, but it was NOT THERE, as you have to actually purchase the disk to get that. And sucker that I am (glad to be one, this time), I bought the disc set from Amazon. (Tip: I got the Blu-Ray version, and the commentary did not work from the menu. I found it, though, by changing the audio track, using the remote).The director's commentary offers lots of interesting insight. I'm glad I purchased the movie, just for it. It was a little annoying that the director says ""sort of"" and ""kind of"" over and over, in a similar way to how people used to say ""like"" (He says that a lot too!). I noticed that same exact thing of another commentator for a totally different movie (if you want to know, it was ""All is Lost""), and wonder what the deal is. Despite the ""sorta/kinda"" annoyance, both of these commentaries are extremely well done and very interesting.I like how the scenes from the seventies were not overdone, for instance the glasses, big hair, and home decor of the day. There was just enough of all of that to suggest the time but not to distract from the story line. And that Ashton Kutcher lost and gained weight in order to more accurately play the different ages and sizes of Jobs! This actor's performance mimics the real Steve Jobs in so many ways. For instance, he totally nailed the walk.And that the house used in the film, the one with the famous garage, is the actual house where Steve Jobs grew up! How cool is that?Anyway, great film, I think. If you want exact historical accuracy, though, you won't find it anywhere!

Given that this is a Hollywood treatment rather than a documentary, it is natural to assume much of the focus would be on the more sordid events is Job's life and that's what we get.  The film covers a period which essentially begins in Jobs' parents' garage and concludes with the announcement of the i-Pod.  The movie provides little depth into the whys and wherefores of Jobs' growth as a man.Co-founder Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad) is the technical genius who provides the counter-balance to Jobs' sense of how things should work and how the public would perceive them.  Dermot Mulroney plays Mike Markkula, an early investor who tries to guide the company from a business perspective.  Like many driven people, Steve Jobs expected his people to work as hard as he did.  It would appear no personal life was allowed.  For some this seemed to be expected, but for others the work was about getting a paycheck and Jobs had little use for them.The performances are all very good, but I was a bit put off by Kutcher's attention to the physical quirks of Jobs.  That is, the kind of lumbering gait, the pursed lips and lack of eye contact were a bit distracting.  In the end, ""Jobs"" is a mildly entertaining film that tells us little that we already didn't know.  Steve Jobs was a visionary genius...and a real jerk.The Blu ray disc comes in 1080p with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The movie looks good enough, but this is no great beauty.  Some of the color tinting seemed a bit off, but perhaps that was intended.  Given the era, the sets looked authentic if bland.  Still, I could detect no real flaws or artifacts.  The audio comes with a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option, which much like the video is perfectly acceptable but nothing Earth shaking either.

1629461,A2198O25QYUPXE,B00BEIYL6G,Nicholas R.W. Henning,"[2, 4]","""Jobs"" is a biographical drama film based on Apple Computer co-founder and I.T. innovator Steve Jobs.The narrative takes various extracts from Jobs' life, but the main focus of the story is set from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s.Jobs (Aston Kutcher) is presented with some idiosyncrasies such as the stoop of his walk, his endless drive for perfection, displaying an own boss mentality in appropriate and also inappropriate situations, and in some instances demonstrating ruthlessness towards life and business.The transition of the narrative from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s was abrupt, which could cause some confusion for viewers as to how Jobs has found himself in such a new situation. The viewer though can make reasonable assumptions, but a few extra scenes or flashes of events could have gone a way to eliminate any possible misunderstandings.Apple's reinvention as a company and subsequent breakthrough products could have also benefited from a few more scenes or a highlights reel of key events in the 2000s up until its 2012 market leading valuation. Therefore if the running time of the film was increased by eight minutes (making the total 130 minutes) this could have eliminated some gaps in the narrative. That said the movie does present many exciting, anxious and satisfying stages in the evolution of Apple and also the personal growth and development of Steve Jobs.The film was well acted and the costume and set designs takes the viewer back to the 1970s and 80s with some decent authenticity.Nicholas R.W.

1629468,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00BEIYL6G,Paul Allaer,"[6, 9]","""Jobs"" (2013 release; 122 min.) is a biopic about the rise and fall (and rise again) of Steve Jobs. As the movie opens, Jobs is introducing a new product called iPod to the Apple employees in 2001. After that the movie kicks back to 1974 as we see Jobs at Reed College (even though apparently he isn't officially enrolled). It's not long before Jobs and Wozniak are working on a new product out of Jobs parents' garage, the humble beginning of what would become the iconic company that is Apple.Several comments: first, the movie is in a sense a very traditional bio-pic, and I am okay with that as the story that is being told is so compelling that we don't need a lot of extra drama or glitz thrown in for good measure. Highlights of the movie for me were the scenes leading up to Jobs' removal from the very company that he started (with Wozniak), and the scene in which Wozniak comes to tell Jobs that he is leaving Apple. Second, heving read about Jobs' reputation as someone of a tyrant to work for/with, the movie does bring some of that to the screen, but overall I think Jobs get quite a favorable treatment here. Third, the bulk of the movie centers around the year 1876 to 1985, with some attention to his return in 1996. Other than the opening scene (set in 2001), there is nothing in there from 1997 on, and thus nothing about Jobs' battle with cancer, and also very little (snippets really) about his personal life. Fourth, Ashton Kutcher plays the role of his life as Steve Jobs. Indeed, Kutcher is entirely believable, right down to the way he walks. Can Kutcher gather some Best Actor Oscar buzz for this? He should! There is a slew of other great performances, including J.K. Simmons as Chairman of the Board who is trying to oust Jobs, and also a cameo from James Woods as a Reed College administrator, and Leslie Ann Warren in the blink and you'll miss it role of Jobs' mom. Last but not least, there is a really great soundtrack, including Bob Dylan of course (Jobs adored him) with ""Boot of Spanish Leather"", Cat Steven (opening the movie with ""Peace Train""), Joe Walsh's ""Life's Been Good"", and even Toad the Wet Sprocket towards the very end (with ""Walk on the Ocean"").Bottom line: I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie. Even though it was first shown at the Sundance film festival earlier this year, there has hardly been any buzz about this. Why this is, I have no idea. No surprise then that the screening I saw this at here in Cincinnati this afternoon, was not particularly well attended, which is a shame. If you are in the mood for a quality movie that doesn't feature a comic book action here and where the world doesn't get blown to smithereens, by all means do yourself a favor and go see this movie.

In contrast, in the movie Steve Jobs for all his visual brilliance, autistic Type A drivenness, is shown as a disappointing human being, lacking empathy loyalty or compassion, rivetingly portrayed by Ashton Kutcher.National Geographic: Stress - Portrait of a Killerdocuments adrenalin sequelae on lifespan: anger eating holes in the heart (heart attack) and brain (stroke) and decreasing immunity to microbes and mutagens (cancer). Jobs flashed fireworks of vanity spiced with personality disorder. Jobs left unappreciated the loyalty of others, cinematically personified by characters Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad) and Mike Marrkula (Dermot Mulroney). In contrast Professor Temple Grandin continues to teach, mentoring new generations with her life experience and wisdomEthical Wills: Putting Your Values on Paper, 2nd Edition. Though Jobs died young and Professor Grandin is now in her 60s. Perhaps age wisdom and empathy do not coalesce until later in life.Do people live furiously because they sense their lives are destined to be short? or are their lives short because of they way they choose to live?Jobs is a riveting negative role model of human interaction. In the movie, Jobs savages people as disposable widgets sacrificing them to his ego and ambition: his pregnant girl friend, his daughterThe Unexpected Legacy of Divorce: A 25 Year Landmark Study, partners, those who care about him, not friends, since friendship requires mutual effort at connection, and Jobs promptly discards any who are no longer useful or interesting. Jobs' manipulative approach to humans as utilities is frightening but characteristic of personality disorders who choose not to devote energy effort and time to consideration of the feelings of others. Relationships require work.Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving InSelf absorption and self indulgent use of recreational chemicals probably didn't benefit Jobs' longevity or humanity either. Study of children born in 1972 followed to age 38: those who use marijuana display decreasing IQ at age 38, too early for dementia onsetFollowing Sean. Temple Grandin on the other hand eschews all alcohol nicotine caffeine and continues to make contributions to the human community. Both Jobs and Grandin make useful functional products, both are visual thinkers, both changed the direction of their respective fields. But Jobs apparently left a devastated ruin of social interactions behind, while Temple Grandin continues to grow and change and give back. Dr Grandin came to Southern Oregon for the opening of a home for children with special needs. Grandin donates life energy to our shared human fight against poverty ignorance disease.We each choose how to act and execute our livesFrontline: A Class Divided (FRON399). Each biography, biopic movie, informs our personal decisions and our view of the consequences of our behavioral choices. Jobs steps over bodies, like emotional terrorists, mass killers of feelings, who ignore the harm they cause others in competition for fame, publicity and self aggrandizement. Jobs cries when he is fired from Apple. Self pity should not be confused with remorse (apology, amends and commitment to never harm again). Jobs dismissingly accepts caring without returning in kind. Job's calls former supporters as a needy supplicant in search of sympathy. The emotionally mauled do not accept the invitation to return to enabling codependency.Despite exploration in the spiritual East, Jobs appears not to have devoted consistent daily effort to meditation unlike contemporariesThe Empty Mirror: Experiences in a Japanese Zen Monasterywho also ultimately fled the effort required. At least according to the movie, instead Jobs used the short cut LSD recreational chemical method of heightened experience without personal input of patient energy needed to experience self stilling humilityDhamma Brothers, solitudeDeparturesand an attitude of gratitude.Jobs' brain would be interesting to dissect, have MRI magnetic resonance imaging of slices to examine, searching for lacunae, fenestrations, broken connections which puzzled together to create the man.Jobs is absorbing, engaging, forcing reflection on the sequelae of recreational drug use. Contentment lifespan and contributions were curtailed by emotionally suicidal anger, which punched holes in the balloon separating soul from the great void. Frustration resentment and anger marinated Jobs into loneliness, other blaming irritation. The movie Jobs eschews sneaky gossip or character assassination for complete neglect or face on rage. The movie covers Jobs' younger life, perhaps he matured offscreen before the release of the iPhone to audience adulation.Personality disorder is not a mental illness, it is behavior which harms others until and unless consistent effort is made to change.We do not receive wisdom. We must discover it for ourselves following a journey through wilderness which no one can make for us and from which none can spare us. For wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world.

Unsurprisingly, he's pretty lousy. The most oddball non-verbal thing he does is walk like a freak - and even if Steve Jobs DID walk like that in real life - it's just so cringeworthy it shouldn't have been shown. Ashton also still reminds people in nearly every scene that he's the guy from That 70s Show and all those subsequent bad comedy films he did...and his make up as older Jobs looks really, really bad.The only highlights casting-wise though was the guy playing Wozniak and the dark haired guy who played the first investor. Both of those guys did a good job, considering the material they had to work with was so-so and sometimes just plain bad.My issue with the story is that Jobs is painted as a real jerkwad - and that's true, he was - but there's no explanation as to WHY he was allowed time and again to behave that way.

1629508,AOE0XMITAJWDT,B00BEIYL6G,Terry Sunday,"[0, 1]","First, let me say that I have no use whatsoever for Ashton Kutcher. In the past, I've gone out of my way to avoid any and all films or television shows in which he appeared. I'm not sure why, but I just don't care for him as an actor.With that said, I do care very much about the history of personal computer technology. I've read many books and seen many documentaries about the beginnings of the industry. I'm especially interested in the story of Apple Computer. I was an early Apple adopter, back in the pre-Internet days when the company advertised only in dorky electronic hobbyist magazines. Back in the late 1970s, I bought a 64K Apple II with two 5-1/4-inch external floppy disk drives, a CRT monitor and an Epson dot-matrix printer. I used it mainly for writing, with a laughably primitive word processor called Apple P.I.E. (it stood for ""Programma International Editor""). I also learned how to write programs in assembly language, a couple of which I sold through magazine ads.So, my interest in the subject of ""Jobs"" overpowered my distaste for the work of Ashton Kutcher, and I checked the movie out of the public library. And y'know what? It's very good. I enjoyed it a lot. Based on everything I've seen or read, Kutcher nails the role of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs better than any other actor could possibly have done. It's high praise indeed when I say that I sometimes had to remind myself that this guy on the screen was NOT the real Jobs but just an actor playing the part. He's that good in the role.Of course, as in any biopic, the creators of ""Jobs"" took a fair amount of dramatic license with the facts. The story of Apple Computer is long, complex and convoluted, and certainly NOT simple enough to tell in a two-hour movie. That's okay, because once I decided to treat ""Jobs"" as strictly entertainment and not a factual documentary, I just relaxed and enjoyed it. It is very well made, well photographed and visually spectacular. Even better, the dialogue is understandable (a rarity these days), the volume level is consistent (ditto) and the music score is unobtrusive.If you want to know the story of Apple Computer in detail, read some of the scholarly or popular books out there. If you want a broad-brush, somewhat two-dimensional treatment of the life of the company's creative genius, and don't mind the simplifications inherent in the medium, then watch ""Jobs.""As much as it pains me to say this: ""Good job, Mr. Kutcher.""",4,"An Entertaining, if Shallow, Biopic",1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,2458,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'have', 'use', 'whatsoever', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'past', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'way', 'avoid', 'films', 'television', 'shows', 'appeared', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'actor.With', 'said', 'do', 'care', 'very', 'much', 'history', 'personal', 'computer', 'technology', ""'ve"", 'read', 'many', 'books', 'seen', 'many', 'documentaries', 'beginnings', 'industry', ""'m"", 'especially', 'interested', 'story', 'Apple', 'Computer', 'was', 'early', 'Apple', 'adopter', 'back', 'pre-Internet', 'days', 'when', 'company', 'advertised', 'only', 'dorky', 'electronic', 'hobbyist', 'magazines', 'Back', 'late', '1970s', 'bought', '64K', 'Apple', 'II', 'two', '5-1/4-inch', 'external', 'floppy', 'disk', 'drives', 'CRT', 'monitor', 'Epson', 'dot-matrix', 'printer', 'used', 'mainly', 'writing', 'laughably', 'primitive', 'word', 'processor', 'called', 'Apple', 'P.I.E', 'stood', 'Programma', 'International', 'Editor', 'also', 'learned', 'how', 'write', 'programs', 'assembly', 'language', 'couple', 'sold', 'magazine', 'ads.So', 'interest', 'subject', 'Jobs', 'overpowered', 'distaste', 'work', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'checked', 'movie', 'public', 'library', ""y'know"", 'what', 'very', 'good', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'Based', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'read', 'Kutcher', 'role', 'Apple', 'co-founder', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'better', 'other', 'actor', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'done', 'high', 'praise', 'indeed', 'when', 'say', 'sometimes', 'had', 'remind', 'guy', 'screen', 'was', 'NOT', 'real', 'Jobs', 'just', 'actor', 'playing', 'part', 'good', 'role.Of', 'course', 'biopic', 'creators', 'Jobs', 'took', 'fair', 'amount', 'dramatic', 'license', 'facts', 'story', 'Apple', 'Computer', 'long', 'complex', 'convoluted', 'certainly', 'NOT', 'simple', 'enough', 'tell', 'two-hour', 'movie', 'okay', 'once', 'decided', 'treat', 'Jobs', 'strictly', 'entertainment', 'not', 'factual', 'documentary', 'just', 'relaxed', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'photographed', 'visually', 'spectacular', 'Even', 'better', 'dialogue', 'understandable', 'rarity', 'days', 'volume', 'level', 'consistent', 'ditto', 'music', 'score', 'unobtrusive.If', 'want', 'know', 'story', 'Apple', 'Computer', 'detail', 'read', 'scholarly', 'popular', 'books', 'there', 'want', 'broad-brush', 'somewhat', 'two-dimensional', 'treatment', 'life', 'company', 'creative', 'genius', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'simplifications', 'inherent', 'medium', 'then', 'watch', 'Jobs', 'As', 'much', 'say', 'Good', 'job', 'Mr', 'Kutcher']",N/A

It begins with him making the decision to drop out of college then shows his rise from working at Atari to eventually creating the company of Apple computers. I don't really know too much about the life of Jobs but I could tell there was a bunch of stuff they cut out. For example in one scene he bargains with an investor for money for his garage computer shop, the next scene he has a huge office with tons of employees. I know they can't show everything but there are large jumps. They did really seem to skim over a whole story about his daughter that seemed important. I also didn't realize he started at Atari, but the main thing I didn't know was how big of a jerk he was. It is hard to not think of the Social Network when watching this one mainly because of the subject matter. There are a ton of similarities but the one constant between Jobs and Zuckerberg are the way they forgot about everyone that helped them out in the beginning and that is the most devastating part of their lives to me.

Written by first-time writer Matt Whiteley and directed by Joshua Michael Stern (&#8220;Neverwas&#8221; &#8220;Swing Vote&#8221;), &#8220;Jobs&#8221; begins with Steve Jobs (Ashton Kutcher) introducing the iPod in 2001. Then the film flashbacks to the 1970s, when he has just dropped out from college and travelled in India.So far, that&#8217;s fine, but then the film jumps from one episode to another without developing the central character of Jobs. You don&#8217;t have to cover every episode in his life (and we have already a made-for-TV film &#8220;Pirates of Silicon Valley&#8221;), but at least you have to present your own version of what the man is really like, which somehow &#8220;Jobs&#8221; is afraid of doing.The idea of Ashton Kutcher playing Steve Jobs was something unexpected to me, but to his credit, he did a very good job. While watching &#8220;Jobs,&#8221; however, I kept thinking of another bio-pic that was about another influential figure. It was &#8220;The Social Network,&#8221; a biographical film of Mark Zuckerberg, and David Fincher knew what he was doing when portraying the Facebook creator in the opening bar scene. Perhaps it is his incisive vision or touch that is missing in &#8220;Jobs.&#8221;",3,Well-Acted But Lacks Insight,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,1809,"['Watching', '8220', 'Jobs', '8221', 'biographical', 'picture', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'reading', 'student', 'study', 'guide', 'Shakespeare', 'will', 'know', 'someone', '8217', 's', 'life', 'story', 'full', 'events', 'ups', 'downs', 'ups', 'complex', 'person', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'interested', 'feel', 'anything', 'person', 'very', 'much', 'may', 'learn', 'facts', 'many', 'visual', 'details', 'including', 'actual', 'garage', 'where', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'friends', 'worked', 'project', 'do', 'not', 'learn', 'much', 'man', '8217', 'personality.The', 'problem', 'simple', 'film', '8217', 's', 'narrative', 'structure', 'Written', 'first-time', 'writer', 'Matt', 'Whiteley', 'directed', 'Joshua', 'Michael', 'Stern', '8220', 'Neverwas', '8221', '8220', 'Swing', 'Vote', '8221', '8220', 'Jobs', '8221', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'introducing', 'iPod', '2001', 'Then', 'film', 'flashbacks', '1970s', 'when', 'just', 'dropped', 'out', 'college', 'travelled', 'India.So', 'far', '8217', 'fine', 'then', 'film', 'jumps', 'one', 'episode', 'developing', 'central', 'character', 'Jobs', 'don', '8217', 't', 'have', 'cover', 'episode', 'life', 'have', 'already', 'made-for-TV', 'film', '8220', 'Pirates', 'Silicon', 'Valley', '8221', 'least', 'have', 'present', 'own', 'version', 'what', 'man', 'really', 'like', 'somehow', '8220', 'Jobs', '8221', 'afraid', 'doing.The', 'idea', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'playing', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'was', 'something', 'unexpected', 'credit', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'watching', '8220', 'Jobs', '8221', 'however', 'kept', 'thinking', 'bio-pic', 'was', 'influential', 'figure', 'was', '8220', 'Social', 'Network', '8221', 'biographical', 'film', 'Mark', 'Zuckerberg', 'David', 'Fincher', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'when', 'portraying', 'Facebook', 'creator', 'opening', 'bar', 'scene', 'Perhaps', 'incisive', 'vision', 'touch', 'missing', '8220', 'Jobs.', '8221']",N/A

That's why it was so disappointing and depressing to see that the hipster mentality has triumphed in ""Jobs"" at the cost of substance and good writing.What is the hipster mentality? The idea is appearance is everything - that if you wear 1970s vintage clothes, sideburns and mustaches, play 70s music and go barefoot, you will have captured the essence of Steve Jobs.  With Ashton Kutcher in the lead, the illusion was complete - I felt I was watching an extended version of ""That 70s Show.""Jobs is not so much a person in this biopic than a collection of postures, 70s fashions, and occasional bad behavior (symbolized by Jobs yelling into a phone).  Surprisingly, Ashton is not the worst choice to play Jobs, but the script (or lack of) defeats him, and he's reduced to staring intently at the camera (to show Jobs' textbook ""intensity""), copying Job's way of speaking and walking, of course, with a noticeably stoop-shouldered gait.Sadly, the filmmakers have no desire to reveal the ""real man"" behind the image. This hero-worshipping film promotes Job as a Christ-like figure (he even spins in a cornfield, arms outstretched, as if receiving God's message) whose ""genius"" and ""vision"" is unquestioned. This propaganda refuses to pander to non-converts by showing or explaining what made Jobs so special.  We are supposed to act on ""faith"" that, of course, Jobs is a visionary, like Moses.  To preserve this mystical vision (idols aren't supposed to be indebted to anyone or anything), we learn little about  his family background (he was half-Syrian and adopted) or what drove him to break rules, betray and create (see ""the Social Network"" as a great example of how a writer can do this). His successful stewardship of Apple is told more like a fairy tale than a realistic, gritty account of a survivor of the dog-eat-dog business world.This misty-eyed sentimentality and vagueness, so characteristic of the hipster's lack of real-life toughness, ruins the film. Instead, the filmmakers devote loving care to recreating Atari's 1970s-80s office, complete with nostalgic glimpses of ""Breakout"" and ""Pong"" games. We are asked to marvel at the cool, oversized glasses everybody wears. Apparently the director was so happy with the results that he couldn't resist showing it off to the audience - stay for the film's closing credits and you'll see a montage of side-by-side shots inviting you to compare the real 1970s person and the Millennnial-made imitations.If you want to see a Madame Tussaud's Museum in action, watch this. If you want the real Steve Jobs, read his print biography.

It portrays the ascension of the college dropout into one of the leading creative entrepreneurs of the 20th century. Ashton Kutcher plays iconic role in this movie directed by Joshua Michael SternHe begins the movie Jobs with an iconic moment with Steve Jobs inaugurating the first iPod in 2001. As the people rise for a standing ovation he fills with pride. The scene is definitely something that will make the fans go gaga. But do not start expecting a lot after that. The movie as progresses feels like something made for television.Thus it is assured that some other director will pick up the biography again and definitely with a better budget. Another bad thing about Jobs the movie is that it feels rushed. A lot of things passes by the screen even before it can make an impact over the viewer. May be they needed a bigger time line or they needed to drop out some elements to make it look impressive.Ashton Kutcher tries well to adopt the character in the movie Jobs. He exceeds in most of it but you can notice the efforts at certain places. However he did a good job. But the character that has been crafted for Steve should have been more visionary than someone who keeps yelling at people. This something they missed.On a brighter note, Jobs the movie is definitely entertaining for most of the time in the 122 min timeline. They have tried to capture all the important events but again, they have been straightforward. The supporting cast has done well including Josh Gad as Steve Wizniak and Dermot Mulroney as Mike Markkula.There is nothing in the movie Jobs that will take you deeply into the life of Steve Jobs and thus it cannot be accounted as a biopic.
