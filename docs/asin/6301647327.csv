A girl who is a genious gets mixed up with 2 moron's and they are there to help save the day. That big guy who played Jaws in a couple of the Bond films was probably the best actor in the whole movie. This movie didnt appeal to me, but it probably would appeal to a much younger audience, as it was intended to i think.I found it to be silly, stupid, bad acting.... but the kids might love it, these two brothers hitting each other and pretending it hurt, when you can see that they are lightly tapping things and badly done... a goofy movie can work, but this one just didnt for me.",1,Blahhhhhh,1085443200,"05 25, 2004",2004,671,"['dont', 'find', 'anything', 'funny', '2', 'massive', 'body', 'builders', 'who', 'act', 'couple', 'kids', 'A', 'girl', 'who', 'genious', 'mixed', '2', 'moron', 'are', 'there', 'help', 'save', 'day', 'big', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Jaws', 'couple', 'Bond', 'films', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'actor', 'whole', 'movie', 'movie', 'appeal', 'probably', 'would', 'appeal', 'much', 'younger', 'audience', 'was', 'intended', 'i', 'think.I', 'found', 'be', 'silly', 'stupid', 'bad', 'acting', 'kids', 'might', 'love', 'two', 'brothers', 'hitting', 'other', 'pretending', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'are', 'lightly', 'tapping', 'things', 'badly', 'done', 'goofy', 'movie', 'can', 'work', 'one', 'just', 'didnt']",Think Big VHS

The movie is silly but that is what makes it enjoyable. Too many comedy's today are not just stupid, but vulgar and very low brow.  So movies like this that can be funny without foul language and naked women should be applauded.  There are times you want to think while be entertained but when you just want to free your mind and have some laughs this is the kind of movie you need.  I do not think anyone in the movie has any real acting skills but then again it was not written to win an Oscar, but to have some fun.",5,A Classic in its own right,1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,630,"['one', 'time', 'favorites', 'wish', 'would', 'release', 'DVD', 'would', 'buy', 'instant', 'movie', 'silly', 'what', 'enjoyable', 'Too', 'many', 'comedy', 'today', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'stupid', 'vulgar', 'very', 'low', 'brow', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'foul', 'language', 'naked', 'women', 'should', 'be', 'applauded', 'are', 'times', 'want', 'think', 'be', 'entertained', 'when', 'just', 'want', 'free', 'mind', 'have', 'laughs', 'kind', 'movie', 'need', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'anyone', 'movie', 'real', 'acting', 'skills', 'then', 'again', 'was', 'not', 'written', 'win', 'Oscar', 'have', 'fun']",Think Big VHS

I wasn't expecting much from this low-brow, yet strangely cute and occasionally touching road/chase movie with a touch of sci-fi intrigue, but when it was all said & done I found myself mildly entertained by the dumb shenanigans. I even discovered one of the greatest lines ever uttered in low-budget cheeseball cinema history, which I used to title this review!The protagonists, a pair of muscle-bound twins (the Barbarian Brothers, who attained modest cult success in the late 80s), apparently got their thespian chops from the WWF acting school. Too bad they didn't take a few of the school's wrestling courses while they were at it; they really coulda used it. Why, you ask? Well, it's probably `cuz this flick contains some of the most inept fighting sequences I've ever witnessed, especially the dustup at the airport! The battle royale at the truck stop was pretty funny though, especially the part where the two henchmen are arguing over who gets the chain and who gets the two-by-four.But not only is `Think Big' a dumb movie with ridiculous-looking fight scenes, it's also a veritable showcase of notable b-listers from the late 80s:- Richard Moll, best known as the bald-pated bailiff Bull Shannon from 'Night Court', pops up for a moment as a trucking dispatcher who gives Rafe & Vic (the twins) their latest cargo assignment. I love this one scene, `cuz one of the brothers constantly stares at him with one of the dopiest smiles I've ever seen! I can imagine him thinkin' to himself, &quot;Oh my god, it's Bull Shannon! With hair!&quot;- Tom 'Tiny' Lister, best known as Zeus in `No Holds Barred', has a brief appearance here as well whilst still wearing that `Z' on the side of his head.- David Carradine is constantly on the brothers' trail as an oily repo man out to take back their almost-paid-for truck. Carradine's overdone smarmy laughter, which starts up every time his character thought he had the rig in his hands, became pretty annoying after a while. He does get his come-uppance in the end however, albeit a stupid and unsatisfying one.- Michael Winslow, best known as that guy who imitates different sounds in the `Police Academy' movies, shows up in the truck stop scene about halfway into the proceedings. Sadly, he doesn't break out any new sounds or noises here...- Richard Kiel, best known as Jaws from a couple Roger Moore-era Bond movies, is the leader of the henchmen who try to chase down our gallant iron-pumping duo. Man, is that dude scary! And what's with that big ol' knot in the middle of his forehead? Probably a brain tumor, which would explain why he agreed to take this part...- Martin Mull as the leader of the bad guy minions, doing what he does best: being overly-ingratiating and a bit too eager to please. Y'know, kinda like your stereotypical used car dealer, only more easily flustered when his nefarious plans are torn asunder. Kinda like all of the other roles I've seen him do...- The blond dude who plays one of the henchmen, whose &quot;accent&quot; seems to shift from British to German and back again. Or maybe it's Australian to Swedish and back again? Ahhh, who can tell the diff-- he could be tryin' to speak two different dialects of Martian for all I know...And if that ain't enough, our favorite pair of physically-overdeveloped, genetically-identical goombahs also rap the theme to the opening and closing credits!
