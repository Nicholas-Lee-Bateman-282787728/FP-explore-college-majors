1403243,A3NE5KEHD57Q6S,B004EPZ07K,"Admiralu ""admiralu""","[38, 48]","I am one of the few who really enjoyed Green Lantern. I saw it five times in theaters and couldn't wait for the Blu-ray release. Ryan Reynolds makes a perfect Hal Jordan, heroic, funny and real. Having watched the making of features, it is amazing what the actors did with little or no tangible sets or images to work with. Director Martin Campbell let the actors ad lib many of their lines and I loved how it turned out. Ryan's reactions to flying and the alien situations were real. I don't believe he got enough credit. I also loved Blake Lively as Carol Ferris. She was a strong willed, intelligent women with strong business sense and a fighter pilot to boot. Her character was one of the strongest I have seen in the genre. She wasn't just eye candy, but a partner to Hal. I do love the fact that she knew who Hal was even with the mask on. I have the Extended Cut of this film and if you haven't seen it, the missing footage really makes the difference in this film. The theatrical version doesn't do a great job of explaining the triangle between Hal, Carol and Hector. The additional footage helps to explain this much better. The most compelling scene that was also left out of the theater version is an extended version of the scene where Hal talks to Jason about how much he loves flying. The additional scene has Hal encouraging Jason to close his eyes and relive the day he pitched a no-hitter. Hal closes his eyes as well and talks about how flying makes him feel and how to keep believing that something good is out there. This moment is where the ring actually chooses Hal, not the green glowing pick up outside. I think this really showed a bit more depth of the character and why he was chosen.I was not that familiar with the Green Lantern character, but I really did enjoy the message of not allowing fear to overcome. The scenes on Oa were incredible (but too short) and I would love to have seen more of the other Lanterns. The making of footage gave me a deeper appreciate for what the actors went through, Mark Strong was excellent as Sinestro, and I do hope there is a sequel. I recommend the Extended cut, as it does give a better overview of the story and is a fun film. I love fun comic book films. The audiences that I saw Green Lantern with were surprisingly large (theaters 85% full with a wide variety of age groups who really enjoyed it). This was my second favorite film of the summer behind Thor. I enjoyed this more than X-Men First Class. Don't let the bad reviews keep you away. The one major issue of the release is that the digital copy will not work with iTunes. Streaming with Flixter and Ultraviolet is crap. You have to pay extra for an iTunes copy. We have so many futuristic films where man has screwed up the planet that it is nice to see a positive view of aliens and the universe with a hopeful view like Star Trek.

It's pretty average in most respects but also kinda cool here and there.  I think Martin Campbell is a very competent director but I don't think he took the movie as seriously in some places where he could have.  Basically, in a first movie like this, focus less on all mythology and focus more on Hal Jordan.  Leave most of the aliens for the sequels.  Skarsgard is pretty darned good as the bad dude and surprisingly Ryan Reynolds, who I normally can't stand, is tolerable as Jordan.

1403245,AV8WWKAUIUPH1,B004EPZ07K,A Gamer Guy,"[14, 35]","If you've even touched a Green Lantern comic and then watched this abomination you will know how awful it is.  One of the biggest gripes about the movie was using far too much CGI.  Yes, we all understand CGI was needed for the ring's powers and stuff, but this movie had way way way way too much to the point that I felt like I was watching an animated movie at parts (like when Hal travels to Oa).  The Oa scene was essentially 100% CGI except for Hal's face.  When he's flying with Tomar-Re and you see him from a front view as if he's flying towards you it just looks awkward as heck.  Another gripe was they barely introduced the corps at all.  We see Kilowog for a bit (who actually showed up much later in the comics AFTER Hal's first appearance) and Sinestro for a bit more, but that's really about it.  The introduction of the corps lasts like 10 minutes of the movie.  They also killed off Lanterns who place large parts in the current comics such as Iolande and Isamot (more Lanterns who joined the corps even longer after Hal's introduction in the comics).  The Yellow Ring was a joke as well.  It didn't even explain how Sinestro obtained it (from the weaponers on Qward).  It was basically like he just pulled it out of his pocket and said ""Hey the bad guy is yellow, and this ring is yellow, maybe it will work?""  Sinestro also had no reason whatsoever to take the Yellow ring to use during the credits.  I mean a single noob green lantern just defeated Parralax and Sinestro wants more power when what he has already makes him what he should believe one of the most powerful people in the Universe?  He had no reason to want the ring.  He hadn't even been kicked from the corps yet.  Also, Ryan Reynolds did an awful job as Hal.  He joked WAY too much.  Hal cracks the occasional joke but he's not a jokester.  Blake Lively didn't fit Carol Ferris at all, looks and acting.  Peter Sarsgaard did a decent job as Hector Hammond but his head wasn't big enough.  Why Parralax was even in this movie is beyond me.  Overall I give this like a 1/10.  One of the worst comic book movies ever made.  Its just as bad as X-men 3 and Spider-man 3.  I'm a major DC fan, and don't pay much attention to Marvel but I must say that the Marvel movies this year were infinitely better than this trash.  I hope there is no sequel and if they do a remake that they use different actors, a better and more true storyline, and less CGI.",1,Awful,1317340800,"09 30, 2011",2011,2430,"[""'ve"", 'even', 'touched', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'comic', 'then', 'watched', 'abomination', 'will', 'know', 'how', 'awful', 'One', 'biggest', 'gripes', 'movie', 'was', 'using', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'CGI', 'Yes', 'understand', 'CGI', 'was', 'needed', 'ring', 'powers', 'stuff', 'movie', 'had', 'way', 'way', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'point', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'animated', 'movie', 'parts', 'when', 'Hal', 'Oa', 'Oa', 'scene', 'was', 'essentially', '100', '%', 'CGI', 'Hal', 'face', 'When', 'flying', 'Tomar-Re', 'see', 'front', 'view', 'flying', 'just', 'awkward', 'heck', 'gripe', 'was', 'barely', 'introduced', 'corps', 'see', 'Kilowog', 'bit', 'who', 'actually', 'showed', 'up', 'much', 'later', 'comics', 'AFTER', 'Hal', 'first', 'appearance', 'Sinestro', 'bit', 'more', 'really', 'introduction', 'corps', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'also', 'killed', 'off', 'Lanterns', 'who', 'place', 'large', 'parts', 'current', 'comics', 'such', 'Iolande', 'Isamot', 'more', 'Lanterns', 'who', 'joined', 'corps', 'even', 'longer', 'Hal', 'introduction', 'comics', 'Yellow', 'Ring', 'was', 'joke', 'as', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'explain', 'how', 'Sinestro', 'obtained', 'weaponers', 'Qward', 'was', 'basically', 'just', 'pulled', 'pocket', 'said', 'Hey', 'bad', 'guy', 'yellow', 'ring', 'yellow', 'maybe', 'will', 'work', 'Sinestro', 'also', 'had', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'take', 'Yellow', 'ring', 'use', 'credits', 'mean', 'single', 'noob', 'green', 'lantern', 'just', 'defeated', 'Parralax', 'Sinestro', 'more', 'power', 'when', 'what', 'already', 'what', 'should', 'believe', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'people', 'Universe', 'had', 'reason', 'want', 'ring', 'had', ""n't"", 'even', 'been', 'kicked', 'corps', 'yet', 'Also', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'did', 'awful', 'job', 'Hal', 'joked', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'Hal', 'occasional', 'joke', 'not', 'jokester', 'Blake', 'Lively', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Carol', 'Ferris', 'looks', 'acting', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'Hector', 'Hammond', 'head', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'enough', 'Why', 'Parralax', 'was', 'even', 'movie', 'Overall', 'give', '1/10', 'One', 'worst', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'X-men', '3', 'Spider-man', '3', ""'m"", 'major', 'DC', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'Marvel', 'must', 'say', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'year', 'were', 'infinitely', 'better', 'trash', 'hope', 'sequel', 'do', 'remake', 'use', 'different', 'actors', 'better', 'more', 'true', 'storyline', 'less', 'CGI']",Green Lantern

I'm guessing that Sony ponied up some money to get the Sinestro Corp DLC as a PS3 exclusive.Bravo (blatant sarcasm!) WBE for screwing over the XBox 360 users!  As I mentioned in my first update, this just shows that WBE is only concerned with their bottom line and corporate greed instead of appeasing the gamers and fan base.--Update for Sinestro Corp DLC--Beware the offerings, as the Sinestro Corp DLC is only available on the PS3 as the DLC is extracted from the Blu-ray.  As such, I wrote Geoff Johns--Chief Creative Officer at WBE, this e-mail on how cheated I feel as an XBox 360 ownwer:Dear Geoff Johns,As Chief Creative Officer of WBE, I hope that you pass this on to the rest of the WBE and find a quick resolution.I am one of the many people very excited about next week's release for the Batman: Arkham City game.  I'm also geeking out at the DLCs being developed and offered for this game.  As such, I rushed over to Best Buy during my lunch hour today because today's release of the Green Lantern Blu-ray has the Sinestro Corp DLC for Batman: Arkham City.  I was shocked, yes SHOCKED, to discover that the Sinestro Corp DLC is ONLY available for PS3 users because some goofball decided to put the DLC directly onto the Blu-ray disc!So now, as an XBox 360 owner, I will NOT have the Sinestro Corp DLC when I get Batman: Arkham City next week, while the PS3 owners will.  I'm sure the various boards and blogs will have PS3 users gloating at us XBox 360 users.So, who in their SPROCKING mind thought up this ""brilliant"" idea of excluding XBox 360 users?!?  Since I bought a copy of the Green Lantern Blu-ray, but have an XBox 360, what can I do get the Sinestro Corp DLC?  As an XBox 360 owner, my current option is to hope and pray that the Sinestro Corp DLC gets released on the XBox Marketplace and then I have to pony up money AGAIN for something I already own!As a DC Comics fan, I'm very disappointed that some corporate goofball decided to screw over XBox 360 owners like this!  It shows that WBE is more focused on corporate greed, then by offering goodies to fans and game players.  I guess giving fans that they want with The New 52 only extends to DC Comics, and is not part of how the WBE operates.If this issue can be addressed, I ask that one of two options is implemented:1) Fix this issue ASAP, where XBox 360 owners can get access to a free download of the Sinestro Corp DLC.--or--2) In future, screw video game DLCs that are tied to a Blu-ray.  Or include a DVD that both the PS3 and XBox 360 can read to extract and install any included video game DLCs.I apologize for my tirade, but I'm am sick and tired of the smoke-and-mirrors stuff that is constantly done like this.  Thank you for time in reading my e-mail.Sincerely,{my name}--end of update--As a DC Comics fan, I liked the movie althought I thought the movie's ending was way too comic-book like with Hal Jordan and Parallax.

I love most of the DC characters as well as the Justice League, but I've never been crazy about The Green Lantern. He seems like he should be a Marvel hero and I've just never been impressed with his mythology. But ... since Ryan Reynolds was in this (and I'm a fan of his), I decided to give this movie a try. While the film was not as bad as most critics made it out to be, it also wasn't that good either. It didn't impress; it simply is. Even though the crew tried its best, the villain of the movie is anything but frightening (I guess that happens when you incorporate a CG-created villain). Sarsgaard was good as co-villain Hammond, but I think the main problem with the Green Lantern is that he is the jock of superheroes. Sure, Superman has good looks and muscles but his geeky secret identity of Clark Kent keeps him grounded as a hero and relatable to readers. Hal Jordan as Green Lantern, however, has everything: good looks, a job as a jet fighter pilot, a ladies man, etc. He might as well be a rock star who becomes a superhero. And that's my problem with him. While he has his doubts, he still is hard to relate to -- unless you are a fighter pilot or rock star.

1403270,A1YZMGEC9ELI4L,B004EPZ07K,"A.P. Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[1, 2]","3.5 out of 5When dying alien and Green Lantern Abin Sur is discovered by brash and cocky fighter pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds), Hal's life is suddenly changed when the mysterious alien gives him a green power ring and matching lantern with vague instructions to ""speak the oath.""After finally unlocking the lantern, Hal is taken to the planet Oa where he learns he has become Abin Sur's successor in the Green Lantern Corps and is also the first human to ever bear the powerful mantle of a Green Lantern.As part of his training, Hal is taken under the wing of a powerful Lantern named Sinestro (Mark Strong) whose view of right and wrong is sheer black and white, and who has no trouble enforcing the law with lethal force. Turns out Sinestro wasn't the first to feel this way as long ago one of the creators of the lantern rings--the Guardians of Oa--disagreed with the Oan Council and set off on his own, discovering a new power, this one the yellow power of fear. Now the super powered being Parallax, this former Guardian wishes to take revenge on those who banished him.As Hal learns what it means to set aside his own pride and ego and live by the sacred Green Lantern oath--In brightest day, in blackest night, no evil shall escape my sight. Let those who worship evil's might, beware my power, Green Lantern's Light!--he must come to grips with his newfound power and expel Parallax's presence from the universe once and for all.After the crazy success of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Warner Brothers and DC Comics were in big need of another hit after Superman Returns failed to deliver at the box office, and so they went to another DC hero: Green Lantern. Good choice. He's a kind of Superman/Batman hybrid in that Hal Jordan is human and has the qualities and struggles thereof like Bruce Wayne, and yet by wielding his power ring, his superpowers get up there right alongside the Last Son of Krypton in many ways. Whether this was Warners' reasoning or not, I don't know--probably not--but GL was certainly a good character to try and take to the big screen especially since it had never been done before.In a nutshell, the movie wasn't bad. I liked it. It didn't change my life, but it's not the piece of garbage many folks make it out to be. It covered Hal Jordan's transformation into Green Lantern, delivered awesome effects, created a sense of atmosphere both about the Green Lantern Corp and Oa, and came through on telling a simple story that got Hal Jordan from Point A to B in a reasonable amount of time.People complained there wasn't enough action or not enough stuff on Oa--but those kinds of things are--and weren't--supposed to be the focus of this movie. It was about getting the ring into Hal's hands and teaching him the ol' Uncle Ben motto of ""With great power comes great responsibility.""I like how it took time to get Hal used to using the ring and it wasn't a case of him putting it on and suddenly becoming an expert on creating green light constructs. And once he figured it out, I enjoyed how his constructs were simple--the racetrack, machine guns, etc.--as opposed to something crazy or way too technical. Why? Put yourself in his shoes. You'd probably construct something you're more comfortable with than trying to create some big complicated airship stocked with robot soldiers with a zillion weapons and stuff.The love story between Hal and Carol Ferris (Blake Lively) seemed forced though it did provide a nice bridge between the realm of Oa and Earth. Clearly this relationship was introduced for sequel purposes because those who know the comics know Carol Ferris becomes the supervillain Star Sapphire down the line.I think in the end, Green Lantern did its job. Could it have been better? Sure. Could it have been worse? Yup.Regardless, I like popping this movie into the player from time to time, and if you're a superhero fan, you should, too.",4,In Brightest Day . . .,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,3902,"['3.5', '5When', 'dying', 'alien', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Abin', 'Sur', 'discovered', 'brash', 'cocky', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Hal', 'life', 'suddenly', 'changed', 'when', 'mysterious', 'alien', 'green', 'power', 'ring', 'matching', 'lantern', 'vague', 'instructions', 'speak', 'oath', 'finally', 'unlocking', 'lantern', 'Hal', 'taken', 'planet', 'Oa', 'where', 'become', 'Abin', 'Sur', 'successor', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Corps', 'also', 'first', 'human', 'ever', 'bear', 'powerful', 'mantle', 'Green', 'Lantern.As', 'part', 'training', 'Hal', 'taken', 'wing', 'powerful', 'Lantern', 'named', 'Sinestro', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'view', 'right', 'wrong', 'sheer', 'black', 'white', 'who', 'trouble', 'enforcing', 'law', 'lethal', 'force', 'out', 'Sinestro', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'feel', 'way', 'long', 'one', 'creators', 'lantern', 'rings', 'Guardians', 'Oa', 'disagreed', 'Oan', 'Council', 'set', 'off', 'own', 'discovering', 'new', 'power', 'one', 'yellow', 'power', 'fear', 'Now', 'super', 'powered', 'being', 'Parallax', 'former', 'Guardian', 'wishes', 'take', 'revenge', 'who', 'banished', 'him.As', 'Hal', 'what', 'set', 'aside', 'own', 'pride', 'ego', 'live', 'sacred', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'oath', 'brightest', 'day', 'blackest', 'night', 'evil', 'shall', 'escape', 'sight', 'Let', 'who', 'worship', 'evil', 'might', 'beware', 'power', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Light', 'must', 'come', 'grips', 'newfound', 'power', 'expel', 'Parallax', 'presence', 'universe', 'once', 'all.After', 'crazy', 'success', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'DC', 'Comics', 'were', 'big', 'need', 'hit', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'failed', 'deliver', 'box', 'office', 'so', 'went', 'DC', 'hero', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Good', 'choice', 'kind', 'Superman/Batman', 'hybrid', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'human', 'qualities', 'thereof', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'yet', 'wielding', 'power', 'ring', 'superpowers', 'get', 'up', 'there', 'right', 'Last', 'Son', 'Krypton', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'Warners', 'reasoning', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'probably', 'not', 'GL', 'was', 'certainly', 'good', 'character', 'try', 'take', 'big', 'screen', 'especially', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'before.In', 'nutshell', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'life', 'not', 'piece', 'garbage', 'many', 'folks', 'make', 'be', 'covered', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'transformation', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'delivered', 'awesome', 'effects', 'created', 'sense', 'atmosphere', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Corp', 'Oa', 'came', 'telling', 'simple', 'story', 'got', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'Point', 'A', 'B', 'reasonable', 'amount', 'time.People', 'complained', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'action', 'not', 'enough', 'stuff', 'Oa', 'kinds', 'things', 'are', 'were', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'focus', 'movie', 'was', 'getting', 'ring', 'Hal', 'hands', 'teaching', 'ol', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'motto', 'great', 'power', 'great', 'responsibility', 'like', 'how', 'took', 'time', 'get', 'Hal', 'used', 'using', 'ring', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'putting', 'suddenly', 'becoming', 'expert', 'creating', 'green', 'light', 'constructs', 'once', 'figured', 'out', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'constructs', 'were', 'simple', 'racetrack', 'machine', 'guns', 'etc.', 'opposed', 'something', 'crazy', 'way', 'too', 'technical', 'Why', 'Put', 'shoes', ""'d"", 'probably', 'construct', 'something', ""'re"", 'more', 'comfortable', 'trying', 'create', 'big', 'complicated', 'airship', 'stocked', 'robot', 'soldiers', 'zillion', 'weapons', 'stuff.The', 'love', 'story', 'Hal', 'Carol', 'Ferris', 'Blake', 'Lively', 'seemed', 'forced', 'did', 'provide', 'nice', 'bridge', 'realm', 'Oa', 'Earth', 'Clearly', 'relationship', 'was', 'introduced', 'sequel', 'purposes', 'who', 'know', 'comics', 'know', 'Carol', 'Ferris', 'supervillain', 'Star', 'Sapphire', 'line.I', 'think', 'end', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'did', 'job', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Sure', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'worse', 'Yup.Regardless', 'like', 'popping', 'movie', 'player', 'time', 'time', ""'re"", 'superhero', 'fan', 'should', 'too']",Green Lantern

Instead of crafting a simple origin-story narrative in which we meet Green Lantern and he defeats his first super-foe, the script compresses together several major themes that the original DC Comics series took decades to create. Oh no, it's not enough for GL to get superpowers and have a big epic battle, we also have to tie the first film into whatever major events are taking place in the Green Lantern books of today: his newfound self-doubt, the cosmic battles involving the GL Corps and the Parallax monster (which was kind of boring in this version), the existence of different-colored power rings, etc etc etc etc. They throw too much at their audience at once, and give up too many potential future stories (and sequels).  I think the goal for comic-based movie franchises should be to make a series of films with **smaller, simpler** story arcs, one movie after another, the same way the comics are produced. Making the first movie cover so much territory is tiresome and makes the movies too cluttered and dramatically flawed. Enough already.  Same thing happened to the X-Men, Spider-man, the Hulk, Daredevil, Batman, etc.  These films make money, but they could be much, much better and more enjoyable as well.But, of course, nobody ever asks for my opinion about these things.One bright spot: actor Peter Sarsgaard turned in a deliciously perverse performance as the icky, villanous super-baddie Hector Hammond... He seems to be the only actor in the entire film who wanted to do anything more creative than cashing a paycheck. Too bad they were so quick to kill his character off in the first film.

The scenes in outerspace don't quite seem real but also don't have much to do with the story. The acting is entertaining, led by the always humorous Ryan Reynolds, who excels in all but the few parts where he has to act macho. Blake Lively is attractive, although a bit unbelievable, as a fighter pilot/business woman.This is an easy to understand, funny, superhero movie.

And, having seen the movie, I can tell you that, yes, DC once again screwed up. But for all the movie's shortcomings, the underlying Green Lantern story shines through. It's such a powerful story, not even Reynold's overacting, the cheesey CGI or that godawful suit could destroy it.Yes, the flaws are many. Hal Jordan, for example, is introduced as a kind of irresponsible buffoon. I assume the filmmakers wanted to show that Hal was ""only human,"" full of flaws and able to evolve once he became a Green Lantern. But that gimmick betrays a defining principle of the GL story--that Jordan always strove to be a hero, even when he was just a test pilot. The ring made him a superhero. But it didn't give him his bravery or virtue. That's why the ring chose him.Another problem with the movie is the cartoonish CGI used to depict Oa and the GL Corps. The saddest victim of the cheesey CGI is the great Kilowog. He looks, moves and sounds here like a Disney character. Or, dare I say it, Jar Jar Binks...Then there is the suit--the weird CGI mask in particular. Truly, Ryan Reynolds really does look like Hal Jordan. But when that CGI mask is superimposed over his face, he acquires an off-putting resemblance to Ben Stiller. The suit has that odd shimmering CGI look, and the mask looks strangely flat like grease paint. Ben Stiller in a grease paint mask. It's hard to get over.I could go on. Really, I could go on and on about why this movie is a disaster. But despite all the flaws, I really enjoyed it. This is, after all, the Green Lantern story--Abin Sur, Ferris Aircraft, the big blue headed Guardians of the Universe. It's all there for the first time on the big screen, writ large, radiant and amazing despite its flaws.  If you've never cared much for GL, maybe this is a movie to skip. If you're a real fan, this is a story very much worth seeing. You'll be so frustrated by all it gets wrong, but you'll cheer for what it gets right.",4,"Flawed, but well worth watching if you're a GL fan",1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,2128,"['expected', 'hate', 'movie', 'preview', 'glimpse', 'Reynolds', 'hamming', 'up', 'trailer', 'bad', 'review', 'told', 'DC', 'had', 'once', 'again', 'failed', 'truly', 'get', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'having', 'seen', 'movie', 'can', 'tell', 'yes', 'DC', 'once', 'again', 'screwed', 'up', 'movie', 'shortcomings', 'underlying', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'story', 'shines', 'such', 'powerful', 'story', 'not', 'even', 'Reynold', 'overacting', 'cheesey', 'CGI', 'godawful', 'suit', 'could', 'destroy', 'it.Yes', 'flaws', 'are', 'many', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'example', 'introduced', 'kind', 'irresponsible', 'buffoon', 'assume', 'filmmakers', 'wanted', 'show', 'Hal', 'was', 'only', 'human', 'full', 'flaws', 'able', 'evolve', 'once', 'became', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'gimmick', 'defining', 'principle', 'GL', 'story', 'Jordan', 'always', 'strove', 'be', 'hero', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'test', 'pilot', 'ring', 'made', 'superhero', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'bravery', 'virtue', 'why', 'ring', 'chose', 'problem', 'movie', 'cartoonish', 'CGI', 'used', 'depict', 'Oa', 'GL', 'Corps', 'saddest', 'victim', 'cheesey', 'CGI', 'great', 'Kilowog', 'moves', 'here', 'Disney', 'character', 'dare', 'say', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'Binks', 'Then', 'suit', 'weird', 'CGI', 'mask', 'particular', 'Truly', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'really', 'look', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'when', 'CGI', 'mask', 'superimposed', 'face', 'off-putting', 'resemblance', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'suit', 'odd', 'shimmering', 'CGI', 'look', 'mask', 'strangely', 'flat', 'grease', 'paint', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'grease', 'paint', 'mask', 'hard', 'get', 'over.I', 'could', 'go', 'Really', 'could', 'go', 'about', 'why', 'movie', 'disaster', 'flaws', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'story', 'Abin', 'Sur', 'Ferris', 'Aircraft', 'big', 'blue', 'headed', 'Guardians', 'Universe', 'there', 'first', 'time', 'big', 'screen', 'writ', 'large', 'radiant', 'amazing', 'flaws', ""'ve"", 'never', 'cared', 'much', 'GL', 'maybe', 'movie', 'skip', ""'re"", 'real', 'fan', 'story', 'very', 'much', 'seeing', ""'ll"", 'be', 'so', 'frustrated', 'wrong', ""'ll"", 'cheer', 'what', 'right']",Green Lantern

1403305,A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3,B004EPZ07K,Brian Reaves,"[5, 9]","This movie has faced an uphill battle between the fanboys screaming to see it on screen and the non-fans asking ""who in the world is Green Lantern?"". Ryan Reynolds has tackled the role admirably, but I still feel Nathan Fillion would have been a better choice (though with nowhere near the box-office draw of Reynolds). The movie is one of those that rocks when the action is flying, but falters badly when the ring isn't being used.It starts off strong with Abin Sur facing Parallax and eventually fleeing to Earth to get his replacement. Ryan is picked up by the ring and off we go! The film is faithful to the comics for the most part, and Mark Strong is absolutely dead-on as Sinestro. They couldn't have found a better actor to take the role, even though his part in this film is fairly small. He is obviously here to set the stage for the next movie.Center stage and full focus here is on Hal Jordan and his move from slacker to hero. I have to give this movie MASSIVE points for what happens when Carol meets Green Lantern for the first time. Rather than this stupid ""a tiny mask hides everything"" idea we get from comic books, there is a wonderful confrontation that really lightens things up.The ring constructs are perfect for the comic book fans. Those not familiar with the character, however, may be either a little confused or distracted by them. You have to give the director points for the CGI work he allowed in here. As I said before, when Hal is in costume it's a thrill ride.Is it perfect? No way. Is it up to the caliber of ""The Dark Knight""? Not really. But is it better than ""Superman Returns""? Definitely! I would have to characterize this as a step in the right direction for DC. It's not the home run we were hoping for, but it's not a total disaster either. The sequence during the credits shows us what is to come in the next film and it was pretty much the highlight of the movie for me.

Green Lantern was a fun superhero movie and I loved it. For anyone who knows anything about the Green Lantern, this was a very ambitious undertaking from a special effects point of view. The story is all about aliens, new worlds and a seemingly magical ring that can do almost anything.  Those green energy constructs that are made from the ring appeared in the comics and can come across as silly to someone who may not know that this is what a Green Lantern does.  Sorry critics if you need a make-believe story about a radioactive spider to allow you to suspend disbelief. Why not relax and enjoy the show? It is often funny to see the difference between the jaded critics' reviews and the public perception; Moviefone's ranking (public vs. critics) is abou 99% to 40%.  That's about right.Is the story air-tight? Of course not, it's about a superhero. But then again, neither are stories about vampires, aliens or dinosaurs brought back to life.  It's all make believe.  But then again, this is a DC Comics story as opposed to a Marvel comics story.  The two publishers are different in that Marvel spends more time focusing on the humanity and imperfections of their heroes, whereas DC focuses more on just being the hero.  The stories are more simple, but they have their place, too.  They are also both very enjoyable...if you just sit back and enjoy.HOWEVER....the ""digital copy"" allegedly included is not really a digital copy.  It is a code to access it on line.

I then rebooted my laptop to see if maybe that would help but it did nothing as well.So, I signed up and downloaded 2 services to my laptop (flixster & UltraViolet), waited about an hour for the download to complete, uploaded the movie to my Flixster Collection, rebooted, dragged and dropped the file to iTunes and after all of that nothing happened at all.  Waste of time.  I can only watch it while connected to the internet with my laptop, not with my iTouch offline.  A real fast one WB did to their customers.  I will never buy another movie with UltraViolet aka Ultra Trash digital copy again.  I will now contact Amazon and WB to see if they can send me a real digital copy.  If not, it's going back.  This is not what was advertised.*UPDATE on 12-5-11* - I contacted the Flixster support team via email with the issue of UltraViolet's digital code not being compatible with iTunes.  They responded to me quickly and are in the process of mailing me a disc with the digital code for Green Lantern in iTunes.  I also had bought Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Parts 1 & 2 and they sent me those codes instantly for iTunes via email as well.  I raised my 1 star rating to a 3 star rating and yes, I based my rating on the ""Item"" and not the movie.  If I'm paying for a product expecting it to be compatible with my current software/lifestyle the way I've always used these codes then I will expect it to work unless it was advertised that it wouldn't work with itunes.  I will show my approval by giving it a low rating even though the movie was good (The movie was ok btw).  When asked by Amazon to ""Rate this item?"" then that is what I'm rating....the item.  It's not asking me to rate the movie.You can contact Flixster/Ultraviolet by email which is [...]  Hope this info helps those that are currently having this issue.",3,Digital copy for iTunes does not work/exist. *UPDATED*,1322611200,"11 30, 2011",2011,2995,"['everyone', 'else', 'here', 'got', 'mislead', 'believeing', 'digital', 'copy', 'can', 'be', 'downloaded', 'then', 'added', 'iTunes', 'went', 'Help', 'section', 'Flixster', 'also', 'Help', 'UltraViolet', 'read', 'have', 'have', 'latest', 'iTunes', 'software', 'installed', 'must', 'Activate', 'subscription', '3', 'days', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'digital', 'copy', 'did', 'just', 'nothing', 'then', 'tried', 'dragging', 'file', 'iTunes', 'normally', 'would', 'do', 'real', 'digital', 'copy', 'nothing', 'happened', 'again', 'When', 'try', 'play', 'file', 'QuickTime', 'player', 'get', 'following', 'error', 'message', 'Error', '-2041', 'invalid', 'sample', 'description', 'was', 'found', 'movie', 'ADS_UV_GreenLantern_live_main_FAXS_2000k_dl.mp4', '.BTW', 'files', 'were', 'downloaded', 'following', 'path', 'hard', 'drive', 'C', '/', 'Documents', 'settings/', 'pc', 'name', 'here', '/', 'documents/', 'My', 'videos.I', 'checked', 'Download', 'tab', 'Flixster', 'see', 'downloaded', 'amazement', 'was', 'still', 'downloading', 'waited', 'finished', 'took', 'forever', 'complete', 'thought', 'maybe', 'was', 'reason', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'transfer', 'iTunes', 'when', 'finally', 'finished', 'still', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'then', 'rebooted', 'laptop', 'see', 'maybe', 'would', 'help', 'did', 'nothing', 'well.So', 'signed', 'up', 'downloaded', '2', 'services', 'laptop', 'flixster', 'UltraViolet', 'waited', 'hour', 'download', 'complete', 'uploaded', 'movie', 'Flixster', 'Collection', 'rebooted', 'dragged', 'dropped', 'file', 'iTunes', 'nothing', 'happened', 'Waste', 'time', 'can', 'only', 'watch', 'connected', 'internet', 'laptop', 'not', 'iTouch', 'offline', 'real', 'fast', 'one', 'WB', 'did', 'customers', 'will', 'never', 'buy', 'movie', 'UltraViolet', 'aka', 'Ultra', 'Trash', 'digital', 'copy', 'again', 'will', 'now', 'contact', 'Amazon', 'WB', 'see', 'can', 'send', 'real', 'digital', 'copy', 'not', 'going', 'back', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'advertised', '*UPDATE', '12-5-11*', 'contacted', 'Flixster', 'support', 'team', 'email', 'issue', 'UltraViolet', 'digital', 'code', 'not', 'being', 'compatible', 'iTunes', 'responded', 'quickly', 'are', 'process', 'mailing', 'disc', 'digital', 'code', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'iTunes', 'also', 'had', 'bought', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Parts', '1', '2', 'sent', 'codes', 'instantly', 'iTunes', 'email', 'as', 'well', 'raised', '1', 'star', 'rating', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'yes', 'based', 'rating', 'Item', 'not', 'movie', ""'m"", 'paying', 'product', 'expecting', 'be', 'compatible', 'current', 'software/lifestyle', 'way', ""'ve"", 'always', 'used', 'codes', 'then', 'will', 'expect', 'work', 'was', 'advertised', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'itunes', 'will', 'show', 'approval', 'giving', 'low', 'rating', 'even', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'ok', 'btw', 'When', 'asked', 'Amazon', 'Rate', 'item', 'then', 'what', ""'m"", 'rating', '.the', 'item', 'not', 'asking', 'rate', 'movie.You', 'can', 'contact', 'Flixster/Ultraviolet', 'email', '[', 'Hope', 'info', 'are', 'currently', 'having', 'issue']",Green Lantern

1403315,A3MU9G6YWKTGTA,B004EPZ07K,Cary L. Brown,"[3, 5]","This review is for the ""extended edition"" BD/DVD combo set (I say this because Amazon tends to clump different versions together).I missed the flick at the theater...  going to theaters has become an ordeal anyway, so now that I have a great home theater system, it's almost a waste of time to go to a normal theater.  Unless something's showing at the Alamo Drafthouse (a local restaurant/bar/theater where you can order food and drinks during the show, and which is not open to the under-twenty-one crowd in general!), I never go to the theater at all anymore.I'm a long-time Green Lantern fan...  I grew up loving the character, and still do, though I stopped buying the books some time back.  Which is fine since DC is once again ""Rebooting"" their universe, apparently...  and most of what I used to know is now ""invalidated"" anyway... sigh.)So, I purchased this yesterday and watched it last night.  I did not watch the theatrical version but instead only watched the extended version (both can be viewed from the BD).The one big flaw in this film is that, like with so many other films of this type, they tried to shoehorn waaay too much into way too small of a movie.  As others have said, this is really at least three movies worth of material...  the recruitment of Hal Jordan, the story of Hector Hammond, and the ""Parallax"" thing.  And they tried to connect these things which really should be unconnected, leading to a ""contrived"" feel at times.I was not a total fan of some of the casting.  I'm not a huge fan of Ryan Reynolds in general..  no matter what, he'll always be ""Van Wilder"" to me, I guess, and I've never seen him come across much differently.  But they could have done a lot worse, too.  And really, Tim Robbins?  He was a TOTAL waste of pay in this movie... they'd have been better off getting a no-name player.  They clearly paid a lot for him, and he brought next to nothing to the film.  I sure hope he didn't get paid more than Peter Sarsgard was paid, or that Mark Strong was paid... because each of them deserved at least twice what Robbins deserved to be paid.I didn't care for the ""glitzy"" costume or the ""artsy"" design for the ring and lantern (though the GENERAL shape of the ring was nice).  This was a case where ""less would be more"" as far as I'm concerned.  Too many movies do this...  getting too wrapped up in the ""artsy"" stuff and in the process losing track of the important part...  the storytelling.And the one real flaw of this flick was with the storytelling, which was just ""overcompressed.""  I LIKED the movie, though the redefinitions bothered me quite a bit.The good?  Reynolds did OK, and the character was (mostly) written well...  you get more of that with the extended edition, I believe, by the way.  Blake Lively is great as Carol Ferris, and Sarsgard is great as Hammond (although the character is WASTED in this film, I'm afraid).  The GL Corps is nicely done, all around, though I (personally) would have preferred an entire first flick focused on the Corps and Hal's integration into the corps.I disliked how Parallax was redefined, but overall, I thought it was an acceptable ""generic deux ex machina"" monster...  along the lines of Grendel, really.  But this character had pretty much nothing in common with the Parallax who, in the books, possessed Hal Jordan and caused him to go insane and (temporarily) become the most powerful (if well-intentioned) villain in the universe.  I would have been much happier if they hadn't used this name, and if they hadn't used the name Krona for the guardian who became Parallax (since this wasn't what happened in the books, and Krona was a totally different villain as well).Ultimately, this is a nice, solid ""B"" movie.  My criticisms are mainly due to how badly I wanted it to be an ""A+"" movie.  But there have been very few ""A+"" movies (so far, only Batman Begins meets that criteria for me, personally).  This was better than any of the Superman flicks so far (and many grades above the last Superman flick).  It's a FUN movie, but it's not, in the end, an impactful movie.So, pop some popcorn, sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is.  It's a fun movie with great effects which is a passable parallel to the comics character's world in a few ways.And make your own judgements, don't pay attention to the overly hostile reviews.  It's not a bad flick, just not as good as it COULD have been.",4,"Better than average flick, though with real flaws",1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,4404,"['review', 'extended', 'edition', 'BD/DVD', 'combo', 'set', 'say', 'Amazon', 'clump', 'different', 'versions', 'together', '.I', 'missed', 'flick', 'theater', 'going', 'theaters', 'become', 'ordeal', 'anyway', 'so', 'now', 'have', 'great', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'almost', 'waste', 'time', 'go', 'normal', 'theater', 'something', 'showing', 'Alamo', 'Drafthouse', 'local', 'restaurant/bar/theater', 'where', 'can', 'order', 'food', 'drinks', 'show', 'not', 'open', 'under-twenty-one', 'crowd', 'general', 'never', 'go', 'theater', 'anymore.I', ""'m"", 'long-time', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'fan', 'grew', 'up', 'loving', 'character', 'still', 'do', 'stopped', 'buying', 'books', 'time', 'back', 'Which', 'fine', 'DC', 'once', 'again', 'Rebooting', 'universe', 'apparently', 'most', 'what', 'used', 'know', 'now', 'invalidated', 'anyway', 'sigh', 'So', 'purchased', 'yesterday', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'theatrical', 'version', 'instead', 'only', 'watched', 'extended', 'version', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'BD', '.The', 'one', 'big', 'flaw', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'type', 'tried', 'shoehorn', 'waaay', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'too', 'small', 'movie', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'really', 'least', 'three', 'movies', 'material', 'recruitment', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'story', 'Hector', 'Hammond', 'Parallax', 'thing', 'tried', 'connect', 'things', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'unconnected', 'leading', 'contrived', 'feel', 'times.I', 'was', 'not', 'total', 'fan', 'casting', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'general..', 'matter', 'what', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'guess', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'come', 'much', 'differently', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'worse', 'too', 'really', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'was', 'TOTAL', 'waste', 'pay', 'movie', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'getting', 'no-name', 'player', 'clearly', 'paid', 'lot', 'brought', 'next', 'nothing', 'film', 'sure', 'hope', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'paid', 'more', 'Peter', 'Sarsgard', 'was', 'paid', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'was', 'paid', 'deserved', 'least', 'twice', 'what', 'deserved', 'be', 'paid.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'glitzy', 'costume', 'artsy', 'design', 'ring', 'lantern', 'GENERAL', 'shape', 'ring', 'was', 'nice', 'was', 'case', 'where', 'less', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'Too', 'many', 'movies', 'do', 'getting', 'too', 'wrapped', 'up', 'artsy', 'stuff', 'process', 'losing', 'track', 'important', 'part', 'storytelling.And', 'one', 'real', 'flaw', 'flick', 'was', 'storytelling', 'was', 'just', 'overcompressed', 'LIKED', 'movie', 'redefinitions', 'bothered', 'quite', 'bit.The', 'good', 'Reynolds', 'did', 'OK', 'character', 'was', 'mostly', 'written', 'well', 'get', 'more', 'extended', 'edition', 'believe', 'way', 'Blake', 'Lively', 'great', 'Carol', 'Ferris', 'Sarsgard', 'great', 'Hammond', 'character', 'WASTED', 'film', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'GL', 'Corps', 'nicely', 'done', 'around', 'personally', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'entire', 'first', 'flick', 'focused', 'Corps', 'Hal', 'integration', 'corps.I', 'disliked', 'how', 'Parallax', 'was', 'redefined', 'overall', 'thought', 'was', 'acceptable', 'generic', 'deux', 'ex', 'machina', 'monster', 'lines', 'Grendel', 'really', 'character', 'had', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'common', 'Parallax', 'who', 'books', 'possessed', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'caused', 'go', 'insane', 'temporarily', 'become', 'most', 'powerful', 'well-intentioned', 'villain', 'universe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'happier', 'had', ""n't"", 'used', 'name', 'had', ""n't"", 'used', 'name', 'Krona', 'guardian', 'who', 'became', 'Parallax', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'happened', 'books', 'Krona', 'was', 'totally', 'different', 'villain', 'well', '.Ultimately', 'nice', 'solid', 'B', 'movie', 'criticisms', 'are', 'mainly', 'due', 'how', 'badly', 'wanted', 'be', 'A+', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'few', 'A+', 'movies', 'so', 'far', 'only', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'criteria', 'personally', 'was', 'better', 'Superman', 'flicks', 'so', 'far', 'many', 'grades', 'last', 'Superman', 'flick', 'FUN', 'movie', 'not', 'end', 'impactful', 'movie.So', 'pop', 'popcorn', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'what', 'fun', 'movie', 'great', 'effects', 'passable', 'parallel', 'comics', 'character', 'world', 'few', 'ways.And', 'make', 'own', 'judgements', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'overly', 'hostile', 'reviews', 'not', 'bad', 'flick', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'COULD', 'have', 'been']",Green Lantern

Hal himself isn't at all sure he's suited to the job, and neither is Sinestro (Mark Strong), a veteran Lantern who considers humans a young and primitive species.  But what neither Hal nor Sinestro knows is that the xenobiologist genius Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard), son of a powerful Senator (Tim Robbins) who's always considered him a disappointment, has been tapped to head up the analysis of Sur's body--and contaminated by a bit of Parallax's bioessence in the Lantern's fatal wound.  Hal tries to resign from the Lantern corps, but when he discovers that Parallax is threatening Earth, he knows he can't shirk his duty.  There's plenty of action and some fine SFX, but at the core of the film is the distinction between being without fear (which is what Sinestro believes Lanterns must be) and overcoming fear (which, Hal realizes, is the key to success as a Lantern and otherwise).",4,The truth about fear,1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,2206,"['movie', 'gotten', 'fair', 'amount', 'less-than-stellar', 'press', 'various', 'quarters', 'definitely', 'derivations', 'fromStar', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'IV-', 'A', 'New', 'Hope', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'andSpider-Man', '3', 'found', 'not', 'despicable', 'example', 'popular', 'superhero-adventure', 'genre', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'test', 'pilot', 'Ferris', 'aeronautical', 'corporation', 'son', 'pilot', 'who', 'died', 'eyes', 'fiery', 'explosion', 'when', 'Hal', 'was', 'just', 'boy', 'two', 'brothers', 'think', 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'need', 'die', 'certainly', 'tend', 'take', 'fantastic', 'risks', 'Following', 'hotdogging', 'faceoff', 'pair', 'drone', 'fighters', 'wing', 'man', 'Carol', 'Ferris', 'Blake', 'Lively', 'daughter', 'company', 'owner', 'Jay', 'O.', 'Sanders', 'girlfriend', 'were', 'kids', 'Hal', 'fired', 'suddenly', 'scooped', 'up', 'ball', 'mysterious', 'green', 'energy', 'dying', 'Arin', 'Sur', 'Temuerua', 'Morrison', 'member', 'intergalactic', 'police', 'force', 'known', 'Green', 'Lanterns', 'Sur', 'crash-landed', 'earth', 'being', 'attacked', 'being', 'called', 'Parallax', 'feeder', 'embodiment', 'fear', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'one', 'Immortals', 'who', 'originated', 'Lantern', 'corps', 'knowing', 'doomed', 'ordered', 'ring', 'source', 'powers', 'find', 'replacement', 'chosen', 'Hal', 'Hal', ""n't"", 'sure', 'suited', 'job', 'Sinestro', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'veteran', 'Lantern', 'who', 'humans', 'young', 'primitive', 'species', 'what', 'Hal', 'Sinestro', 'xenobiologist', 'genius', 'Hector', 'Hammond', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'son', 'powerful', 'Senator', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'who', 'always', 'considered', 'disappointment', 'been', 'tapped', 'head', 'up', 'analysis', 'Sur', 'body', 'contaminated', 'bit', 'Parallax', 'bioessence', 'Lantern', 'fatal', 'wound', 'Hal', 'resign', 'Lantern', 'corps', 'when', 'Parallax', 'threatening', 'Earth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shirk', 'duty', 'plenty', 'action', 'fine', 'SFX', 'core', 'film', 'distinction', 'being', 'fear', 'what', 'Sinestro', 'Lanterns', 'must', 'be', 'overcoming', 'fear', 'Hal', 'key', 'success', 'Lantern', 'otherwise']",Green Lantern

Also puzzling was that if one Oan Guardian became totally corrupted by the power of ""yellow fear"" power source and became cosmically evil, now the other remaining Guardians of Oa are going to make yellow rings based off the same corruptible yellow power source for it's Lantern Corps to fight the renegade Guardian with? Yeah, I know, a total recipe for disaster on a super cosmic scale. Also, if Abin Sur, Hal Jordan's legendary predecessor,  defeated Parallax all by himself, shouldn't the intimate details of that case be within the Green Lantern Corps records on the planet Oa and shouldn't it therefore be common knowledge throughout the entire Green Lantern Corps?.....Yeah, whoever wrote the script for this movie failed to cover some serious ground on this one.Plus,like the other comic book fans of Green Lantern, I also really wanted to see the film focus more about Hal Jordan being right here on earth as Green Lantern fighting some terrorists, or maybe saving a crumbling freeway bridge during rush hour traffic, or preventing some defenseless towns from being swept away from a bursting hydro-dam's billions gallons of raging water.However, Green Lantern: the movie, does do a lot right, though...Like Ryan Reynolds giving  a charming and very entertaining take on Hal Jordan. The actor playing Sinestro is dead on in his performance and a perfect casting choice for the part! Also, the actress playing Carol Ferris was smoking hot! Her and Ryan Reynolds looked very good on screen together and some real smoldering chemistry! The special effects were cool,too.While I do wish that the final fight between Green Lantern and the fear-based monster, Parallax , while they were both still on earth, would've been way longer and a bit more epic in scale. Yet, again, what's here is still very cool.I got a really big kick out of watching Green Lantern defiantly saying his legendary Green Lantern oath while Parallax had G.L. on the ground and was talking all kinds of crazy smack about devouring the earth like a small $1 apple. ..LOL..Man, I've watched Green Lantern over and over again and it brings a big smile to this DC comics fan's heart.Trust me, after sitting in the movie theaters and wasting 20 bucks on a truly horrible IRON MAN 3 movie, having a soft spot in my fan-boy heart for this Green Lantern movie for just 2 bucks is an absolute  bargain.Plus, I'm really hoping that DC comics and Warner Brothers studios totally  ignores all of the haters and plans on making another cool Green Lantern movie with Ryan Reynolds very soon!...If so, I'm so on board!",4,"THE HARD CORE DC COMIC BOOK FANS WEREN'T DOWN FOR THIS OUTING BUT, FOR ME, GREEN LANTERN WAS A COOL  & FUN SUMMER MOVIE!",1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,3488,"['Even', ""'m"", 'Green', 'Lantern', 'fan', 'silver', 'age', 'comics', 'sat', 'listened', 'negative', 'reviews', 'stayed', 'far', 'away', 'movie', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Still', 'used', 'copy', 'movie', 'was', '2', 'bucks', 'now', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'really', 'awful', 'was', '.Going', 'movie', 'beforehand', 'realizing', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'iconic', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'ever', 'truly', '100', '%', 'perfect', 'imagine', 'shocking', 'surprise', 'laughed', 'cheered', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'watching', 'Hollywood', '2011', 'updated', 'take', 'classic', 'silver-age', 'version', 'Green', 'Lantern.Sure', 'course', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'movie', 'sort', 'bothered', 'watched', 'Carol', 'Ferris', 'being', 'ace', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'wing-man', 'comics', 'Carol', 'Ferris', 'only', 'ran', 'father', 'airplane', 'manufacturing', 'company', 'did', ""n't"", 'fly', 'planes', 'Also', 'puzzling', 'was', 'one', 'Oan', 'Guardian', 'became', 'totally', 'corrupted', 'power', 'yellow', 'fear', 'power', 'source', 'became', 'cosmically', 'evil', 'now', 'other', 'remaining', 'Guardians', 'Oa', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'yellow', 'rings', 'based', 'off', 'same', 'corruptible', 'yellow', 'power', 'source', 'Lantern', 'Corps', 'fight', 'renegade', 'Guardian', 'Yeah', 'know', 'total', 'recipe', 'disaster', 'super', 'cosmic', 'scale', 'Also', 'Abin', 'Sur', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'legendary', 'predecessor', 'defeated', 'Parallax', 'should', ""n't"", 'intimate', 'details', 'case', 'be', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Corps', 'records', 'planet', 'Oa', 'should', ""n't"", 'therefore', 'be', 'common', 'knowledge', 'entire', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Corps', '..Yeah', 'wrote', 'script', 'movie', 'failed', 'cover', 'serious', 'ground', 'one.Plus', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'also', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'focus', 'more', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'being', 'right', 'here', 'earth', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'fighting', 'terrorists', 'maybe', 'saving', 'crumbling', 'freeway', 'bridge', 'rush', 'hour', 'traffic', 'preventing', 'defenseless', 'towns', 'being', 'swept', 'away', 'bursting', 'hydro-dam', 'billions', 'gallons', 'raging', 'water.However', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'movie', 'do', 'lot', 'right', 'though', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'giving', 'charming', 'very', 'entertaining', 'take', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'actor', 'playing', 'Sinestro', 'dead', 'performance', 'perfect', 'casting', 'choice', 'part', 'Also', 'actress', 'playing', 'Carol', 'Ferris', 'was', 'smoking', 'hot', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'looked', 'very', 'good', 'screen', 'together', 'real', 'smoldering', 'chemistry', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'cool', 'too.While', 'do', 'wish', 'final', 'fight', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'fear-based', 'monster', 'Parallax', 'were', 'still', 'earth', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'way', 'longer', 'bit', 'more', 'epic', 'scale', 'again', 'what', 'here', 'still', 'very', 'cool.I', 'got', 'really', 'big', 'kick', 'watching', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'defiantly', 'saying', 'legendary', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'oath', 'Parallax', 'had', 'G.L', 'ground', 'was', 'talking', 'kinds', 'crazy', 'smack', 'devouring', 'earth', 'small', '1', 'apple', '..LOL..Man', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'over', 'again', 'big', 'smile', 'DC', 'comics', 'fan', 'heart.Trust', 'sitting', 'movie', 'theaters', 'wasting', '20', 'bucks', 'truly', 'horrible', 'IRON', 'MAN', '3', 'movie', 'having', 'soft', 'spot', 'fan-boy', 'heart', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'movie', 'just', '2', 'bucks', 'absolute', 'bargain.Plus', ""'m"", 'really', 'hoping', 'DC', 'comics', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'studios', 'totally', 'haters', 'plans', 'making', 'cool', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'movie', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'very', 'soon', 'so', ""'m"", 'so', 'board']",Green Lantern

1403335,A10TTJD5BNJZW6,B004EPZ07K,"Crazy Animated ""The Collector""","[9, 13]","I went to see this movie being very excited and also somewhat nervous after hearing so many negative reviews (which I normally do not pay too much heed, but I was highly anticipating this movie), and being a big comicbook fan I had hoped the movie would have been received better. I was greatly surprized to find that it was immensely enjoyable, and I was confounded as to why there was such a general dislike for the film. The story is simple and characters somewhat campy, but it works really well for a typical super-hero movie. I thought the special effects were great, with the minor exception of some of the aliens at times. I thought the inclusion of so many details for fans to spot was done excellently, without detracting from the story or causing unnecessary cunfusion to the general audience. It really was a nicely told story that kept its focus and allows for a great deal more to be shared with a continuing saga. I really hope to see a sequel!I feel that in a summer full of super-hero movies, Green Lantern was being too strongly compared with others, and not being allowed to be judged as it is. Instead, I hear things like 'Thor was better'. Well that may be, but this movie is nothing like Thor, and comparing them so generally doesn't do either one justice for what it acheives. Where Thor was about a god learning humility, Green Lantern is about a man overcoming fear, and proving that what makes humans great is their ability to be brave when afraid. I really liked that despite him starting out as kind of a jerk, Hal Jordan still chose to do what was right even when he felt incapable. I hope to see his character grow more in more films.Overall, I had a great time seeing this film, and while I haven't read a Green Lantern comic in over a decade (I am loosely familiar with the new rebirth and such, but I really am a big fan of the Emerald Twilight story and also Guy Gardner's character. The last Green Lantern comic I read was Kyle Rayner's origin, but anyway...), I thought this movie was one of the best interpretations of a comic to film that I have seen in a long time. I don't feel a comicbook movie necessarily needs to be as acurate to the source material as some people do, as long as the story told shares the message and tone. I feel Green Lantern did an excellent job conveying a realistic beginning to this super-hero. I put it on par with Iron-man and Batman Begins for its cinematic adaptation enjoyment level.08/25/2011 editI saw the movie again in the dollar theater. It is such a fun movie!

1403338,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004EPZ07K,C. Sawin,"[4, 7]","It feels like forever since Green Lantern first went into production, doesn't it? With all the news about more money being injected into the project to round out the special effects to Ryan Reynolds possibly not being involved in the Deadpool film that may or may not ever see the light of day to sequels already being greenlit to the film's reputation of being downright terrible, Green Lantern has had a ton of ups and downs along the way and its release is finally upon us. While there are certainly better superhero films released in the past few years in comparison and there is some truth to reports of the film being plagued with huge flaws, it still doesn't take away from Green Lantern being at least somewhat entertaining.As you can imagine, we follow Hal Jordan as he becomes a Green Lantern and the film is mostly the story of how he learns to deal with the ring, where it comes from, his biggest threat(s) and enemies, etc. It's an origin story, which seems fine going into it. Once you're actually watching the movie though, it feels like the origin story is forced. It's not that an introduction isn't needed, but we seem to spend a little too much time with Hal's past than we do with this extraordinary world that's just been presented to him. The film shines brightest during the scenes in outer space and you'll be craving more of the cosmos once the film is over. I personally wanted more Tomar-Re and Kiliwog. The special effects are at their best when Hal is in space en route to Oa or when Parallax is sucking the fear right from the bones of some poor organism. Planet Oa itself looks amazing and Parallax always comes off as both devastating and engrossing. Green Lantern almost felt like it was hog-tied into taking the origin path while its restraints were tightened every time the film tried to venture off into more adventurous territory.The cast came off as mostly likeable, as well. Ryan Reynolds portrays Hal Jordan to the best of his abilities as his belief in the project really shines through in his performance. Mark Strong looks and sounds like Sinestro, but isn't really given the chance to do anything important. Blake Lively's role was kind of weird. It's like she started off being more than the clich&eacute; love interest and then quickly evolved into nothing more than just that. Peter Sarsgaard is something else though. His over the top performance as Hector Hammond steals every scene he's a part of and that man can SHRIEK! His performance is laughable, but in the best and most memorable of ways.The special effects are just as much a blessing as they are a curse though. As mentioned before, they can get pretty mesmerizing at times. But when the action gets intense and the screen is filled with nothing but hyperactive computer generated effects, that cartoonish feel rears its ugly head. The scenes of Hal in the Green orb when Abin Sur first tells the ring to find a replacement and right before he goes to Planet Oa for the first time are pretty horrible. Once he starts flying it's fine, but him bouncing around kind of kills it. Sinestro came off as disappointing, too. They have the right actor for the role, but he wasn't utilized correctly. He felt similar to how Venom was just thrown into Spider-Man 3; he was just there to appeal to the fanboys. Then there's the post-credits scene that felt rushed. While awesome, it came off as too soon since the film gave no sign of what Sinestro eventually becomes other than this particular scene.Green Lantern is a terribly tainted superhero film. It seems to truck along at a wounded pace; almost as if Abin Sur's fatal wound and death would be a metaphor for how the film would play out. The storyline goes the simple origin route but it feels forced while dialogue was downright lame at times. However, despite its flaws, Green Lantern is still enjoyable. The cast is above satisfactory and seems to do what they can with the material and the special effects show that they are capable of reaching levels of greatness. Green Lantern isn't necessarily atrocious, but it's not good enough to be considered great either. It turns out that its imperfections are half of its charm and is still fairly enjoyable overall.",3,"Flawed, but still entertaining",1308268800,"06 17, 2011",2011,4220,"['forever', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'first', 'went', 'production', ""n't"", 'news', 'more', 'money', 'being', 'injected', 'project', 'round', 'out', 'special', 'effects', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'possibly', 'not', 'being', 'involved', 'Deadpool', 'film', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'ever', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'sequels', 'already', 'being', 'greenlit', 'film', 'reputation', 'being', 'downright', 'terrible', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'had', 'ton', 'ups', 'downs', 'way', 'release', 'finally', 'upon', 'are', 'certainly', 'better', 'superhero', 'films', 'released', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'comparison', 'truth', 'reports', 'film', 'being', 'plagued', 'huge', 'flaws', 'still', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'being', 'least', 'somewhat', 'entertaining.As', 'can', 'imagine', 'follow', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'film', 'mostly', 'story', 'how', 'deal', 'ring', 'where', 'biggest', 'threat', 's', 'enemies', 'etc', 'origin', 'story', 'fine', 'going', 'Once', ""'re"", 'actually', 'watching', 'movie', 'origin', 'story', 'forced', 'not', 'introduction', ""n't"", 'needed', 'seem', 'spend', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'Hal', 'past', 'do', 'extraordinary', 'world', 'just', 'been', 'presented', 'film', 'shines', 'brightest', 'scenes', 'outer', 'space', ""'ll"", 'be', 'craving', 'more', 'cosmos', 'film', 'personally', 'wanted', 'more', 'Tomar-Re', 'Kiliwog', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'best', 'when', 'Hal', 'space', 'route', 'Oa', 'when', 'Parallax', 'sucking', 'fear', 'right', 'bones', 'poor', 'organism', 'Planet', 'Oa', 'amazing', 'Parallax', 'always', 'off', 'devastating', 'engrossing', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'almost', 'felt', 'was', 'hog-tied', 'taking', 'origin', 'path', 'restraints', 'were', 'tightened', 'time', 'film', 'tried', 'venture', 'off', 'more', 'adventurous', 'territory.The', 'cast', 'came', 'off', 'mostly', 'likeable', 'as', 'well', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'best', 'abilities', 'belief', 'project', 'really', 'performance', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'like', 'Sinestro', ""n't"", 'really', 'given', 'chance', 'do', 'anything', 'important', 'Blake', 'Lively', 'role', 'was', 'kind', 'weird', 'started', 'off', 'being', 'more', 'clich', 'eacute', 'interest', 'then', 'quickly', 'evolved', 'nothing', 'more', 'just', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'something', 'else', 'top', 'performance', 'Hector', 'Hammond', 'steals', 'scene', 'part', 'man', 'can', 'SHRIEK', 'performance', 'laughable', 'best', 'most', 'memorable', 'ways.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'blessing', 'are', 'curse', 'though', 'mentioned', 'can', 'get', 'pretty', 'mesmerizing', 'times', 'when', 'action', 'intense', 'screen', 'filled', 'nothing', 'hyperactive', 'computer', 'generated', 'effects', 'cartoonish', 'feel', 'ugly', 'head', 'scenes', 'Hal', 'Green', 'orb', 'when', 'Abin', 'Sur', 'first', 'ring', 'find', 'replacement', 'right', 'Planet', 'Oa', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'pretty', 'horrible', 'Once', 'flying', 'fine', 'bouncing', 'kind', 'kills', 'Sinestro', 'came', 'off', 'disappointing', 'too', 'have', 'right', 'actor', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'utilized', 'correctly', 'felt', 'similar', 'how', 'Venom', 'was', 'just', 'thrown', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'was', 'just', 'there', 'appeal', 'fanboys', 'Then', 'post-credits', 'scene', 'felt', 'rushed', 'awesome', 'came', 'off', 'too', 'soon', 'film', 'gave', 'sign', 'what', 'Sinestro', 'eventually', 'other', 'particular', 'scene.Green', 'Lantern', 'terribly', 'tainted', 'superhero', 'film', 'truck', 'along', 'wounded', 'pace', 'almost', 'Abin', 'Sur', 'fatal', 'wound', 'death', 'would', 'be', 'metaphor', 'how', 'film', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'storyline', 'simple', 'origin', 'route', 'forced', 'dialogue', 'was', 'downright', 'lame', 'times', 'However', 'flaws', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'cast', 'satisfactory', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'material', 'special', 'effects', 'show', 'are', 'capable', 'reaching', 'levels', 'greatness', 'Green', 'Lantern', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'atrocious', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'considered', 'great', 'out', 'imperfections', 'are', 'half', 'charm', 'still', 'fairly', 'enjoyable', 'overall']",Green Lantern

I can't really remember but anyway, The reason why they (the writers/producers) don't give the indebt story anymore, or go the distance to really give you the background, you know kinda like they did to The Last Airbender, is because critics complained about not enough action in movies, or movies dragging before they get to see some action, blame the critics.

Krona is a huge character that has fought not only Green Lantern, but the rest of the DC universe and has crossed over to the Marvel universe during the DC/Marvel team up days. But that's fine.

1403349,A3U7ELIED4WP4R,B004EPZ07K,Dark Faerie Tales,"[2, 6]","The Review:Green Lantern is Warner Bros' latest attempt to climb back on top of the superhero movie genre (with a character other than Batman).  Their last non-Dark Knight attempt was Superman Returns, and that effort met with mixed results and mixed reviews.  Now comes Green Lantern, guardian of sector 2814.  Does he fair any better than the man of Steel?  Yes, but not nearly so well as Batman or Watchmen.  There are now enough big budget superhero movies that they can be placed in tiers.  In the first tier, we have the best of the best: Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Ironman, X-Men: First Class, Thor and Watchmen.  In the second tier there are good movies that fall a little short of greatness, as well as critical acclaim: The Incredible Hulk (Ed Norton Reboot), Blade, Wolverine, and Superman Returns.  Finally, we have failed efforts that are fundamentally poor movies: Ghost Rider, Daredevil, and The Fantastic Four.  Green Lantern fits firmly into that second tier.  It's entertaining, but it will have neither the universal audience appeal of Batman Begins nor its critical acclaim.Green Lantern brings to the silver screen one of the heavy hitters of the DC universe. Hal Jordan is part of a group of galactic peace keepers, each in charge of a sector of space the size of several galaxies.  It's a very big precinct with cosmic threats.  When Jimmy Olsen needs help, he calls Superman.  When Superman needs help, he calls Green Lantern.  The movie's introduction does a splendid job giving the background on the intricacies of the Green Lantern Corps. Notwithstanding the crash course in Green Lantern lore, much of it will be lost on those not at least a little familiar with Green Lantern comics.  This is one of the potential downsides of the film.  On the one hand, those with substantial familiarity with the source material will get the most from the film.  On the other hand those people most familiar with Green Lantern are apt to be critical of the film makers concessions to the medium of film, e.g. there's a lot of nerd rage surrounding Green Lantern's costume.Some fans of the comic have said Green Lantern takes on too much for a single film.  It is not just the origin story of Hal Jordan, played very well by the criminally underrated Ryan Reynolds. It's also about how he has to vanquish two bad guys, while struggling with his green lantern training.  Trying to do so much short changes other aspects of Green Lantern's origin, such as his complex relationship with Sinestro, played by the versatile Mark Strong, who is destined to become Hal's greatest nemesis.  The villains we get in this movie are poor substitutes.  The first, Hector Hammond, while a well developed character, is about as much threat to a Green Lantern as a paper cut. C'mon, he doesn't even rate a cool supervillain code name.  Only Lex Luthor rolls that hard.  The main villain, Parallax, is certainly a galactic threat, but incredibly underdeveloped.  A superhero movie is generally only as good as its supervillain.  Two subpar villains don't make up for the lack of one great villain.Now I didn't think Green Lantern tried to do too much, and I didn't have any trouble following the movie.  But please bare in mind that my head is swimming with such useless facts as the various differences among red, blue, green and gold kryptonite, and how fast Superman would lose his powers under a red sun.  For those of you who didn't dedicate your childhood to the nerdcore equivalent of pondering how many angels can fit on the head of a pin, Green Lantern might seem a little convoluted.But fear not, Green Lantern does do many things right.  Ryan Reynolds is a great Hal Jordan, despite the rantings of innumerable Internet fanboys.  Hal Jordan is a very Marvel-like superhero for DC-at least in his current incarnation.  He's deeply flawed.  A hot headed womanizer who begins as the most irresponsible of squared jawed heroes.  He is an arrogant fighter jock and he does not play well with others.  Hal has a lot of potential and much of the film revolves around whether he will live up to that potential and overcome his fears and self doubt to become the hero he needs to be. Also, the movie looks fantastic.  The CG aliens are in many cases as expressive as their human costars and I mean that to compliment the FX crew, not knock the actors.In the end, Green Lantern is a fun movie.  It is impossible to take it too seriously and I don't think it's possible to make a Green Lantern Begins along the lines of Batman Begins.  Green Lantern is fundamentally about a guy with a magic ring that can do anything so long as its wearer believes strongly enough.  There's a worthwhile, and largely successful attempt to give Hal Jordan gravitas, but you won't find the social themes of Marvel's X-Men nor the epic struggle of Bruce Wayne to become more than a man.  What you will find is an enjoyable romp, heavy on special FX.  In short, a very watchable second tier superhero movie.FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.",3,Brightest Day and Blackest Night,1308700800,"06 22, 2011",2011,5031,"['Review', 'Green',

This is where the ring [intent] chose Hal- intent is the feeling of it already done.  It is interesting that one of the Oans was missing; kind of likeThe Dark Crystal.

1403354,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B004EPZ07K,David J. Brown,"[2, 6]","I haven't read a Green Lantern comic since the mid 90's, which is about the same time as I stopped reading comics.  You know, started liking girls, and films more.  The last exposure I have to the Green Lantern comes from the Justice League series and the animated films being put out by DC lately.  I always thought the concept would make an eye popping film, but at the same time the concept is so inherantly silly and goofy, who would one pull this off.  Well, they didn't quite.  The problem with this film is that it's YET ANOTHER tired origin movie. I figured as much going in.  This film has to set up and explain what this mythology is and how it works.  So, of course there's laborious scenes of people explaining things.  Sure, the plot is barely existant and less important than Hal Jordan becoming a great part of the Lantern Corps.  The movie isn't terrible but it's far from great.Now on the printed page this concept is a ton of fun and works somehow.  On the big screen it all seems as silly as it really is.  Yellow energy of fear?  Green energy of will, the most powerful force in the universe, that also gives the Lantern Corps their super powers?  Yeah, pretty stupid and really silly.  The biggest fault with this film is the fact that they have fantastical things happening every second, to people who are experiencing this stuff for the first time, and they barely acknowledge it.  The scene where Hal Jordan discovers a downed alien and is passed the ring is a great example.  He shows up and rushes over to the downed space craft.  He finds a purple alien and doesn't quite have a normal human reaction. He barely shudders.  This is a missed opportunity for the character to be, you know, characterized!  This could've been done with humor too, which is the weirdest thing about it considering the light tone of the whole film.  I know, I know, we have to move on to the big lights and effects show and get to stuff blowing up real good, but last time I checked, when films do that they turn out to be lame ducks in the vein of the odious Supergirl film.  Now Green Lantern isn't Supergirl bad but it came close once or twice.  Imagine, just for one second, that you found a downed alien space craft.  Imagine there was a dying alien that was inside.  How would you initially react?  What would be running through your mind?  Now class, write down those reactions filtered through any emotion of your choosing and you've just written a better scripted scene than the one appearing in this film.Also, nobody was happier than me to not have extenssive training and learning the ropes of outerspace sequences ala every other super hero movie(hell, the first X-Men was all setting up powers and characters and nothing else), but if there ever was a more convoluted, dense, GRANDER concept than the Green Lantern that really needed this tired form of storytelling I don't know what does.  Batman Begins took a good hour to set up the character and his journey to becoming the Dark Knight, and it was done well and was entertaining, but he's basically a damaged guy dressing like a bat and fighting crime.  Hal Jordan is a regular slacker with daddy issues who's been give an alien energy source and been charged with becoming a member of the an intergalactic police force!!!!!  This needs more set up and nuance not to be laughable, confusing or just plain stupid.  The movie gives lines of dialogue through a fish alien thingy that conveniently wrap the rules up as we enter the Lantern home planet.  That's it and Hal's off and flying, literally.  We get two combat training sequences in a row, both to display effects, and both to introduce major players in the Lantern mythology.  Hal gets bummed and decides to quit.  Faster than you can say contrivance a school chum of his, hired by secret government guys, has been dissecting the alien he got the ring from, and he gets infected, somehow, with a piece of the 'other' villain of the movie, Paralax.  He becomes quite alien and insane, and of course has a crush on the female lead, who, what else, gets kidnapped and used to bring Hal out.  ALthough, the scene where this plan is formulated, and then when Hal finds out, seem to be missing.  Hal shows up somewhere, finds Hector infected and powerful, with his girl in tow, and then the climax starts pummeling forward with elaborate, if not too special, special effects.That's the other thing, Paralax is set up as this angry ex-Guardian, who wants nothing but revenge on the Corps.  He's on his way to their home base to destroy them, but decides to go to earth.  Why, besides that these films need earth to be in peril for anyone to give a crap?  Well, because he wants to destroy the one wearing the ring of his old enemy???  Huh?  That's really lame, contrived and totally shoehorned into the third act of the film.  Also, there's a moment where Hal reveals his powers up close and personal to a scientist friend of his.  The friend calls him a super hero.  Not good.  A film that is a super hero movie, unless sending it up or satirizing it, shouldn't call its main character a super hero.  This should feel new and wonderous.  Which is the film's main problem.  It just doesn't have a sense of wonder which one would think would come naturally to such an outlandish fantasy subject.  Just watch Richard Donner's first Superman film, it's loaded with wonder, and comparison to the Green Lantern, it's mythology is way easier to swallow.Anyway, I've complained enough.  The film isn't awful, despite what I've written.  Some of the effects are fun and neat, especially the alien designs for the other Lanterns.  Ryan Reynolds is better at the quips than he is at the heroics, but he never feels out of place.  Peter Sarsgard is wonderful as the super villain Hector.  His storyline, while tired, was more compelling than any of the Paralax stuff.  Why did Paralax need him to kill the Lantern, if he was on his way to earth anyway?  Paralax seemed to be very capable of killing Jordan himself, so why enlist the help of a demented human being?  Oh, wait, I'm complaining again.  He's good and I would love to see him in other movies, or a sequel to this.  Tim Robbins registers quickly with his limited scenes as Hector's overbearing father, a Senator.  Angela Bassett(where has she been?) also comes off  believable as some sort of shadow op for the government.  The love interest is fine.  Nothing special, like say Gweneth Paltrow in Iron Man and Natalie Portman in Thor, but good.  They at least give her the courtesy of helping Hal in the end AFTER he has been obligatorily kidnapped.  The realizations of Lantern home base is pretty cool.  Some more info on what the Guardians do when not floating atop pillars pondering, would've been nice.  And, yes, I know what they do due to actually having read the comics, but this is seperate from the films and one shouldn't be required to have read the comics to enjoy or understand the film.  Paralax is pretty cool too, but his visualization did remind me a bit of Galactis from Rise of the Silver Surfer.Martin Campbell directed this film, which is surprising to me.  He's nowhere to be seen in this film.  He is responsible for reinvigorating Bond TWICE(Goldeneye, Casino Royale) and he is a really solid storyteller and action director.  The action in this film are mostly done completely CGI.  Campbell has employed visual effects in his films before, but not on this level.  He seems to lose his visual style and flare among the completely digital scenes and action beats.  This film may have been his learning curve for his next venture, or a reason to never do a film as loaded with effects as this.  When the film mixed the real with the CGI it isn't always successful, and I'm not sure if that's the director's blocking or the visual effects lacking.The film is fun and breezy, but totally inconsequential and not a great representation of The Green Lantern.  The recent direct to video WB animated Green Lantern film has the vibe down better and is very enjoyable for those of you who haven't seen it.  The Green Lantern is no Dark Knight, Superman, Iron Man....or even Thor or X-Men: First Class(two better films that came out earlier this year).  It's more on the level of the first X-Men or Batman Forever.  It's passable fun, but nothing great.  I would like and hope, not that this origin and setting up crap has been done and blundered, that the sequel can tell a good story and let this silly concept shine in all of its unashamed glory.",3,"Underwhelming, mixed bag of goofiness.",1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,8536,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'comic', 'mid', '90', 'same', 'time', 'stopped', 'reading',

1403375,AIA1X0R7JEIA8,B004EPZ07K,Duane Browning,"[0, 0]","The bonus features consist of video interviews of various people who had a part in the comic book series. They go into the history of the series from the early beginnings until the present day. These are most useful for anyone who hadn't been a fan of the comic series and/or was unaware of its history. However, most of these things could be learned by simply reading the Wikipedia articles on the subject.Green Lantern is a modern retelling of how Hal Jordan becomes the first human Green Lantern. The straightlaced Hal Jordan from the comics is replaced by the rather roguish film version. I find the film version much easier to relate to, as he has problems with commitment to relationships, self-doubts and more than the usual helping of cockiness.Suddenly, he finds himself given the enormous responsibility of being a Green Lantern, who is charged with the guardianship of an entire sector of space, including all star systems and sentient species within them. Some people have labelled Hal as being whiny, but if I suddenly was given this kind of a burden, I might have some doubts as to my ability to carry it out and I think any honest person would have to admit the same.The Green Lantern Corps is shown as having faults of its own, as well. Sinestro, who is apparently the leading Green Lantern, displays more than a little arrogance in his belief that the Corps has never been defeated and never will be, which is proved incorrect early on. The news comes as quite a shock to him early in the film.

1403377,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B004EPZ07K,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","I honestly didn't know a lot about the Green Lantern before this movie, since he's not nearly as well known as Spiderman, Superman or Batman. And, well, the ""Green Lantern"" movie isn't really the best way for the public to be introduced to him -- it's thinly-plotted, with a forgettable female lead and a barrage of flashy, splashy CGI.Fighter pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) is suddenly abducted by a ball of green energy, and deposited next to a dying alien who gives him a ring and a green lantern. Before you can say ""it's not easy being green,"" he's zapped off to an alien planet called Oa, where the Green Lantern Corps is headquartered.What is the Green Lantern Corps? Well, they're an intergalactic force for good, who rely on the green energy of WILLPOWER (just roll with it), and are able to use their rings to fly, fire energy blasts, and make anything they can imagine. And the Corps wastes no time in training Hal in his ring's use, although their leader Sinestro (Mark Strong) doesn't think he's up to the job.However, it turns out that the dead Green Lantern was killed by Parallax, a vast malevolent creature feeding off the yellow energy of fear -- and it's also infected a mousy scientist (Peter Sarsgaard), who goes on a rampage. Now Hal must somehow overcome his own fears, or the entire Earth will be destroyed by Parallax.The Cinema Snob said that this felt like the pilot for a Green Lantern TV show, and I have to agree with him -- it's basically all an origin story for the Green Lantern, and everything else is basically secondary to Hal Jordan becoming a superhero and proving himself. It's not horrible, but it failed to thrill me as an epic superhero movie should.So for most of the running time, Martin Campbell tries to dazzle us with flashy action sequences (a dogfight with AI fighter jets) and vast expanses of glitzy special effects (the glimmering emerald cities of Oa). The plot is pretty thin and straightforward, with no real twists or surprises -- about ten minutes in, you can easily predict everything that will happen after that. Seriously, four writers worked on this?And yes, I found it VERY distracting that Parallax looks like a giant cosmic diarrhea attack. I am not kidding -- he looks like Sauron's poo.Ryan Reynolds is.... passable. He doesn't seem like he's trying very hard during the more dramatic scenes, but he's pretty good when Hal is being goofy (""To infinity and beyond!"") or kicking butt. And Mark Strong and Peter Sarsgaard give excellent performances as a suspicious military leader and a big-brained scientist-turned-megalomaniac.But Blake Lively as the token love interest? She's not only completely nondescript and bland, but totally devoid of chemistry with Reynolds. She literally looks like his much younger sister.""Green Lantern"" does a decent job introducing us to the world of the Green Lantern Corps, but the plot is so thin and predictable that it really doesn't do the concept justice.

1403378,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B004EPZ07K,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 5]","THE GREEN LANTERN (2011, 118 minutes) was considered a lousy flop by way too many people. Though I saw it as a refreshing break in the usual comic book superhero overflow coming from cinema, I can also see why it was viewed as a flop. The stunning, drool-inspiring, comedically gifted Ryan Reynolds (as Hal Jordan, who first appeared in the comics in 1959 and was the second in a lineage of 5 Earthlings to belong to the Green Lantern Corps) simply could not carry this film on his own - something he was unfairly expected to do.Even at that, it didn't do too badly at the box office. Without further belaboring of the story (Green Lantern alien falls to earth, lets his Green Lantern ring choose Reynolds, blah blah) let me observe a few things:-Reynolds has a body that matches his talents. Why it had to be CGI'd into the oblivion of a silly Green Lantern suit is beyond me. So much for the staggering line of hunks who were dying to play the role.-Then again, half this film appeared to be no more than a cheap cartoon. Doing CGI? - then do it right!-There was no villain to speak of, though the giant burnt head reminded me of the Wizard of Oz. Hey ... emerald, Oz, planet Oa, green ... is something else going on here?! (Of course: DC was always derivative, while Marvel was original.)-Most touching to me was the lesson, that which is so often thrown out the window with these films but bot here. The lesson is fear can be lethal, and it can be conquered. It shocks me DC Comics tossed this out and not Marvel.-The strange, whiny college-age kids music did absolutely nothing for this film.-The powerful homophobic message is probably what really killed this among certain fans. Wallywood, when will you learn?? Don't you know Reynolds is a front-running poster-boy favorite?!-Of course that's not as bad as the original 2006 script for this: Jack Black was to play a parody of the Green Lantern but this came up against so much hostility they thought they'd better do it 'straight'.-Final piece of trivia, I promise: Tom Kalmaku's unusual appearance had to be accomplished by someone special. Therefore the gorgeous Taika Waititi, half Jewish, half Maori, got the job. It adds a nice spice to Reynolds' golden-boy-next-door charisma.Though the film is certainly set up for a sequel, it must be the worst idea in California right now to even think of such an atrocity. But I for one wouldn't mind seeing more of the delightfully dorky Ryan Reynolds and his unbelievable body ... which I know I will be seeing. In fact, to slightly contradict myself, it truly was Reynolds who made this film bearable at all.With the (wasted) talents of Michael Clarke Duncan, Geoffrey Rush (won't see them, just hear them), Mark Strong, Peter Sarsgaard, Tim Robbins, Angela Basset, and Temuera Morrison.",3,I'll never see green in the same light,1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,2793,"['GREEN', 'LANTERN', '2011', '118', 'minutes', 'was', 'considered', 'lousy', 'flop', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'saw', 'refreshing', 'break', 'usual', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'coming', 'cinema', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'viewed', 'flop', 'stunning', 'drool-inspiring', 'comedically', 'gifted', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'who', 'first', 'appeared', 'comics', '1959', 'was', 'second', 'lineage', '5', 'Earthlings', 'belong', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Corps', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'carry', 'film', 'own', 'something', 'was', 'unfairly', 'expected', 'do.Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'too', 'badly', 'box', 'office', 'further', 'belaboring', 'story', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'alien', 'earth', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'ring', 'choose', 'Reynolds', 'blah', 'blah', 'let', 'observe', 'few', 'things', '-Reynolds', 'body', 'talents', 'Why', 'had', 'be', 'CGI', ""'d"", 'oblivion', 'silly', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'suit', 'So', 'much', 'staggering', 'line', 'hunks', 'who', 'were', 'dying', 'play', 'role.-Then', 'again', 'film', 'appeared', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'cheap', 'cartoon', 'Doing', 'CGI', 'then', 'do', 'right', '-There', 'was', 'villain', 'speak', 'giant', 'burnt', 'head', 'reminded', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Hey', 'emerald', 'Oz', 'planet', 'Oa', 'green', 'something', 'else', 'going', 'here', 'course', 'DC', 'was', 'always', 'derivative', 'Marvel', 'was', 'original', '-Most', 'touching', 'was', 'lesson', 'so', 'often', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'films', 'bot', 'here', 'lesson', 'fear', 'can', 'be', 'lethal', 'can', 'be', 'conquered', 'DC', 'Comics', 'tossed', 'out', 'not', 'Marvel.-The', 'strange', 'whiny', 'college-age', 'kids', 'music', 'did', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'film.-The', 'powerful', 'homophobic', 'message', 'probably', 'what', 'really', 'killed', 'certain', 'fans', 'Wallywood', 'when', 'will', 'learn', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Reynolds', 'front-running', 'poster-boy', 'favorite', '-Of', 'course', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'original', '2006', 'script', 'Jack', 'Black', 'was', 'play', 'parody', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'came', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'hostility', 'thought', ""'d"", 'better', 'do', ""'straight'.-Final"", 'piece', 'trivia', 'promise', 'Tom', 'Kalmaku', 'unusual', 'appearance', 'had', 'be', 'accomplished', 'someone', 'special', 'gorgeous', 'Taika', 'Waititi', 'half', 'Jewish', 'half', 'Maori', 'got', 'job', 'nice', 'spice', 'Reynolds', 'golden-boy-next-door', 'film', 'certainly', 'set', 'up', 'sequel', 'must', 'be', 'worst', 'idea', 'California', 'right', 'now', 'even', 'think', 'such', 'atrocity', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'more', 'delightfully', 'dorky', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'unbelievable', 'body', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'fact', 'slightly', 'contradict', 'truly', 'was', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'bearable', 'wasted', 'talents', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'just', 'hear', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Angela', 'Basset', 'Temuera', 'Morrison']",Green Lantern

I watched the movie on its own terms.  After a confusing start, it gradually grew on me and I began to enjoy the goofy conglomerate of action, flash, and fury.  It was a live action cartoon.  It did exactly what it was supposed to do, entertain.  Yes, at times it was a bit cumbersome, but for all that it still made a statement that worked just fine in the superhero universe.  If I had any concerns it was with the star, Ryan Reynolds.  His predilection for playing smart alecks and jackasses had me worried.  In this case, thankfully, he was toned down.  True, he was still playing a bit of a jerk, but the reckless, braggart at least grew during the course of the film.  At times he appeared appreciatively overwhelmed with his unearned power.  I'm glad they didn't try to make a joke of it.  As for the rest of the cast, I'm puzzled as to why Tim Robbins and (especially) Angela Bassett consented to appear in insubstantial roles that ultimately amounted to nothing and could have been played by anyone to the same effect.  The only actor who got to showcase his talents was Peter Sarsgaard (playing the pathetic villain Hector Hammond).It's by no means a masterpiece.

So I'm going to tell you about the film and the special features because everyone else is glossing over it all because they don't get their digital copy.>>>I am not slamming those who are yelling about this... I'd be pissed too if I needed the digital copy.&lt;&lt;&lt;So, the extended version may only increase the show time by a mere 8 minutes, but it is a 8 minutes well placed. The family scene really made a huge difference for the movie. As it should, because it had been a huge central theme in the comics leading up from rebirth to Blackest Night. I remember watching GL in theatres and being a little underwhelmed in terms of my fan-boy expectations. My first viewing of the Extended Cut struck just the right vibe for  me.First, the BD has Focus Points, literally focusing in on the various paths to complete for the movie as a whole. Broad points on design of the fan favourite characters and the planet Oa, make up for the Guardians. The whole process of the dogfight. Basically mini-featurettes. And well done at that. There's a lot of cool backgrounds on the film's nuances, and no repeating of material. These also explain why some elements were played around with, and by watching these, you can see the sense of it all. Thumbs up for that.Next up is an in-depth look at the history of the Green Lantern/Hal Jordan character, core concepts of the character's rebirth. Then, we have a few scenes from the coming Green Lantern animated series. It is a bit too stylized for my tastes, but it looks intriguing given that the Red Lantern Corps and even the Blue Lanterns show up regularly.

If you followed the comics, there's so much foreshadowing in this movie of things to come. I felt it set up sequels very well.2. We all know Sinestro will eventually use the Yellow ring (Powered by fear) becoming one of the corps greatest foes.3. Hal will eventually become Parallax (He's possessed by Parallax), dies and returns as the Spectre.4. Introduction of other Human GL's will make for good sequels. It would be cool for them to do a Justice League movie as well.5. The CG SFX in this film were pretty good. They mixed up his constructs enough that we didn't see him doing the same thing over and over.The bad:1. I agree with other reviews that said it should have been longer in order to build the characters or the GL's. I didn't feel there was enough interaction with the corps.DVD packaging quality:Not happy that the reg DVD is the movie only and has absolutely zero extras. That's what the digital copy is for.

The foreshadowing was a little heavy handed though I thought.**Spoilers**I kind of thought that some of the guardian elements were poorly done though. I find it strange that they are supposed to be these immensely intelligent people but Sinestro so easily convinced them to harness the power of fear. But really that's my only qualm with the story.

1403397,A3O4QM66IHX8KD,B004EPZ07K,Gabe in Nash,"[6, 9]","OK, so I will admit some major bias, I am a big fan of Green Lantern ever since the Death of Superman saga back in the early/mid 90s. So that being said, I have had some time to fall in and fall out of the GL fanboy status but still my heart pumps that crazy green glow no matter what. Hence, when I heard that this movie was coming out I was absurdly ecstatic about it (kind of like how I was when I heard about Transformers). And much like Transformers, I didn't go into this movie expecting much.First of all, the movie had Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan. Ryan Reynolds as the care free, smartass Kyle Rayner maybe, but not as the serious and solemn Hal Jordan. Honestly, I could've seen Nathan Fillion in his younger days as Hal but really, the guy from 2 Guys and a Girl and a Pizza Place? And yet with my skepticism, he works. Despite what I would consider some major artistic license with this re-imagined version of the title character, Reynolds works his charm, comic timing, and overall sincerity to make this version of Hal Jordan very likable to the point that you might actually be reciting the oath with him (I did so under my breath at one point I think).Folks gave this movie some major flak for some of the effects looking too cartoony. We all realize two things about this film right? One: this is a freaking comic book based movie for Christ's sake! Magic ring and spandex! Granted, the 100% CGI costume is a bit overboard in my humble opinion and did have some moments of cheese with it. However, this is a movie about a guy who gets a magic ring and meets aliens one of which is a human sized chipmunk! Two: we do realize who this character/actor is? One scene in particular that many critics and audience members disliked was the race track that GL used to divert the falling helicopter. The ring makes constructs from the user's will power and imagination. From the goofy and immature way that Hal Jordan is portrayed, who is really surprised by this? Yes it is cartoony to the point that it reminds me of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" but it is sort of the way they were going for. Once again, not exactly how Hal Jordan is in the comics but once again, re-imagining and artistic license.The acting and writing. OK, that I will give in on. The writing sounded like it came straight from the comics and as eye candy(licious) as Blake Lively is, I wouldn't consider her the strongest actress out there. However, she and Reynolds do make an attractive couple and they do have decent chemistry with one another. Unfortunately, a lot of the other actors are relatively forgettable in this movie. And yes, there are some major plot holes in this film. The Guardians are beings from the beginning of time with infinite wisdom with one of them becoming the being known as Parallax and he somehow forgets about the gravitational pull deal? OK, fine I'll forget about that. Then Sinestro after witnessing Hal Jordan proving the power of the Green Lantern Ring does his thing at the end? Couldn't they have made this more of Lucifer thing with him becoming jealous or something instead of just a random act? Eh, what can you do?For all its faults, Green Lantern is still entertaining with plenty of eye candy in either visual effects, Lively, or Reynolds. The acting and writing isn't the best but this is a comic book movie looking more for box office receipts instead of Oscar nods. Is it true to Green Lantern lore? No. Is it entertaining and a decent origin story to introduce the general populace to Green Lantern? Kinda. Is it worth a watch when you don't really want to tax the brain?

1403400,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B004EPZ07K,Gary P. Cohen,"[8, 13]","I've been a GL fan since buying issue #1 in 1960.  I've been waiting for a GL film for years since it obviously could have never been done without the CGI technology currently available.  The last film I saw that I was as excited about was the Star Trek revamp 2 years ago.  I loved the film and saw it twice in the theaters.  I cannot understand why it has done so poorly in the theaters.I knew the film was in trouble when I read the first ridiculous reviews.  The first review I read called him a ""Second tier"" super hero.  Second Tier??  The character was originally created in 1940 and the silver-age GL, the one in this film, has been published continuously since 1960 (and before that in his ""Showcase"" tryout.)  The second review I read was one of those ""Enough super heroes already"" types.  It was obvious how the reviewers were going.  After positive reviews to ""Thor"" and ""X Men First Class,"" they had to find one super hero movie to destroy and show their power as movie reviewers.  Unfortunately, Green Lantern was their victim.  I've seen them do this numerous times before.What I don't understand however is the criticism from comic book fans.  I can't believe that they would be affected by the opinions of movie critics. For some reason, they agreed with the critics.  I don't.  I thought it was an excellent film with a good cast headed by a likeable Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan and a quite hot Blake Lively as Carol Ferris.  The origin story and the special effects were good, the sets incredible.  The only film I enjoyed more this summer was ""Captain America.""Anyway, I'm looking forward to purchasing the film on blu-ray.  I hope that the disappointing grosses of this film do not cause Warner Brothers to cancel GL #2.

I checked out the time length and that really should have been a clue. How much of an origin story can be told in 90 minutes? As a disclosure, I have never read a GL comic, but I am a fan of the superhero movies. I was fully prepared to like it so much that I would buy an anthology of comics. The patheticness of this movie makes me want to check out the comics to see what the real story is about, but forget about ever adding this movie to my collection.I had a few problems with this movie. As much as I love Reynolds as an actor, I did not see him as this character. I felt like I was watching Ryan. It's as though I was always conscious of him. As for Blake Lively, I've seen Gossip Girl, so I know who she is. But in this movie, she felt like a gimmick. As though the producers said, ""which young starlet should be in this movie?"" I felt that Ryan and Blake had no chemistry. Some people, IMO, just don't fit this genre (cough cough Katie Holmes cough cough). Their kiss at the end made me cringe. In the beginning, when she was in pilot mode, I was surprised and thinking ""oh OK, so she's gonna be different from all the other distressed damsels"" (again, I've never read the comics). I thought the movie would have other plans, but it ended up being cliche.I mentioned in my title that I dozed off. Well, the last scene I recall was Peter Saarsgard in pain in his bed, and then I woke up and Green Lantern had formed some race track or something. I have NO clue what I missed and only figured it out based on the plot summary.Lots of wasted familiar faces here: Tim Robbins, Angela Bassett (total surprise) and Mark Strong. The battle scene with Parallax was over so quick. And I'm no scientist, but how did Hal get so close to the sun w/o getting singed?This just wasn't up to snuff.

The movie starts off with Hal Jordan, a shallow test pilot working for a government contractor.  He's reckless and has a history of job hopping...but somehow people continue to hire him as a test pilot.  After crashing a $1 billion dollar fighter jet, he gets fired.  Who knew?A purple alien crash lands on Earth and the green energy scoops-up Jordan and flys him over to the alien ship.  The ship and the alien look fake, like they came from the scene of a video game...wait, that's what actually happened!  Hal takes the ring, puts it on, and the ring transports him across a bunch of galaxies to an alien planet.  He gets his butt kicked during training, so he quits.The plot gets more absurd when a professor pricks himself with the yellow stuff in the alien's dead body.  This somehow turns him into a mad scientist super villian with a big-ugly frog face that wants to rule the world.  We don't even know who this guy is or why he now wants to rule the world.The frog-face wants to start killing people, even though he has no real motive.  He causes the helicopter to spin out of control. Wait..look up in the sky!  It's green lantern to save the day!  The helicopter AND the damsel are saved.Frog face is mad that his plot to kill people for fun was thwarted, so he kills his dad and other government officials in a science lab.  Wait...look up in the sky!  It's Green Lantern.  Uh oh, Frog face guy stole the damsel and she's in DISTRESS!  What are we going to do?  Green Lantern manages to save the day again!  Who knew?Funny though, Frog face isn't even the real villian.  The real villian is Parallax, who is a big blob of fear floating around the universe eating people.  Naturally, Earth is next.  The blob reaches earth and kills Frog face.  The fight between Green Lantern and the blob is too ridiculous to describe with a straight face.  It ends with Green Lantern punching the blob in the face with a big green fist right into the sun.Overall, the movie comes acoss as lame and predictible.  There is no real victory in defeating Parallax because there is no real personal sacrifice that makes Green Lantern true hero.  A true hero is a martyr that goes against the established customs at great personal risk for the greater good.  Spiderman is a nerdy college kid that fights crime part time, even at risk of his grades and his future.  Captain Kirk defies orders and ignores the &#34;prime directive,&#34; often risking a court marshall to save Earth and the Federation.  Without that, Green Lantern is just another super hero.

While Superman set a nice, high bar, the series itself descended into the same silly shambles that plagued the Burton Batman revival and, really, Sam Raimi's third installment of Spiderman. The X-Men series met the same fate though it seems to be rebooting nicely and the Dark Knight and Avengers ""prequels"" have all established a solid, pretty serious standard for comic book fare. Enter, then, Green Lantern. A project initially intended as a comedy starring Jack Black, we get instead an immense opera orchestrated around the cosmic side of, let's face it, one of DC's B-listers. It looks rich, plays with a story that goes both deep and wide and doesn't get too moody. It plays like a really good comic book and at no time aspires to ""serious"" cinema. Nor should it.I am not a Ryan Reynolds fan but felt he balanced the character well. How seriously can a green flying man making imaginary projections really take himself? The writers succeeded in the daunting task of telling the origin tale and introducing an audience to the staggering Green Lantern Corps all while incorporating a phantasmic villain and folding in the seeds of the villainous turn for Sinestro. Heavy stuff for under 120 minutes. And it succeeds. What else could you want?  A less shiny, CGI-obvious suit, maybe but, otherwise, I was 100% pleased. We got Hal Jordan on Earth and the menagerie of his fellow Corps members in space. We get sincere, noble and multifaceted turns from Sinestro and Abin Sur. We get conflict on a cosmic scale. And it all looks GREAT.Not a movie for the uninitiated. But if you ever read Green Lantern comic books in the 70s or 80s I cannot see how you can leave this film unhappy. The Blu-Ray Extended Cut comes with a ton of extras, including a download code for the film as well as the feature-length Emerald Knights animated feature (and these worked fine for me on as downloads to an iPhone despite other criticisms I have read).

1403411,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004EPZ07K,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","GREEN LANTERN is a spectacle to watch - much Technicolored etherized air, visits to other planets, transformations of aliens into humanoid forms and vice versa, lots of derring-do on part of the newly hewn superhero, etc such as in all of these comic book turned films that are so popular - but at its core is a rather sensitive story that for this viewer redeems it. It is a tale of how to overcome fear and to believe in dreams in order to make life in this world livable that for the audience of youngsters for whom these comic books were created presents a challenge and a possibility. It also brings some insight into the topic of filial competition and the role that parents play in fostering this unfortunate sense of worth. Is it a great film or a revelation of philosophy? No, but it does entertain on a different level than most other movies of this nature and that is in large part to the fine performances of a cast that takes the film seriously - in a good way.A really fine synopsis of the story is here: 'A cocky test pilot, Hal Jordan, acquires superhuman powers when he is chosen by ""the Ring"", the willpower-fed source of power, of the Green Lantern Intergalactic Corps. He, reluctantly at first, takes on the challenges these superheroes face. Putting his self-doubts aside, and spurred on by his sense of duty and love for his beautiful, intellectually equal, colleague, Carol Ferris, he is soon called to defend mankind from Parallax, a super-powerful being who feeds on fear. He is the universe's last chance, as many Lanterns have been killed and the Corps is weakened. And he might just be the right Lantern for the job of keeping the world safe from harm.'Martin Campbell directs the solid cast of seen and unseen characters: Ryan Reynolds shines as Hal Jordan, our 'Green Lantern', Taika Waititi is Hal's best friend Tom, Blake Lively is solid as Carol Ferris, Peter Sarsgaard morphs as Hector (Hal's brother), Tim Robbins is the father figure, Mark Strong is the Spock-like Lantern from another planet, Angela Bassett steps in as the secretive Doctor Waller, Temuera Morrison is the lantern space alien who passes the ring to Hal after succumbing to the evil of Clancy Brown as the ominous Paralax, there are some fine voiceovers for the creatures of the Planet AO - Geoffrey Rush as Tomar-Re, Michael Clarke Duncan as Kilowog, and Warren Burton and Salome Jens as the Guardians.Ryan Reynolds has such a strong positive screen presence that he is able to make us root for his flying sculpted body Green Lantern. Though the film had bad press and failed to create box office accolades, it is a strong movie for this genre. Seeing on Amazon on demand gives it a full screen treatment to try before buying the DVD.

When one is mortally wounded his ring, the willpower driven source of his powers, searches the nearest planet to find a fitting replacement. So when Abin Sur, the red skinned alien over seeing our part of space crashes on Earth, his ring summons a seat of the pants test pilot named Hal Jordan to replace Abin Sur and warn the other Lanterns that a previously defeated evil is on the loose again.Hal is physically without fear but has a fear of commitment that leaves his personal life in a shambolic mess. Added to the usual Hal Jordan back story is the idea his dad was also a test pilot who died in a crash and Hal is still chasing that ghost with his wild flying. Sounds good but it comes way too close to Tom Cruise' character in ""Top Gun"" and Cruise did it better.Summoned to the base world of the Green Lanterns, Hal is given minimal training and returns to Earth, pouting about how he was treated and discovers that Earth will be the next target of the evil and it falls to the newest Green Lantern in the universe to face the greatest evil they've ever fought.It is all very pretty but way too predictable.

YEO ""gyeo""","[0, 0]","GREEN LANTERN is actually a good movie until its last act...no spoilers here, but the elaborate build-up, the solid characterisations and spectacular special effects which are definitely blockbuster-worthy, just fall short in the build-up to the battle royale. Kind of how the Fantastic Four dropped the bomb with Galactus in another movie - the movie's scriptwriters present an uninteresting, unscary alien villain for Green Lantern to fight.  Parallax is well rendered visually, but he's kinda like a floating tree trunk.  Somehow intergalactic bad doesn't play so well when most of the movie actually works really well on a more down-to-earth intimate level.I really think Hollywood's forgotten just how to craft and create good villains that will keep audiences on the edge of the seats.  The thing was, I was watching the show and trying to figure out why an overwhelming majority gave it a bad review and then - as the last half hour played out, I understood.  I will say it again - the effects are great and this is probably exactly how Green Lantern should have been styled and brought to life.  It's a visual masterpiece just about, and hopefully with a round 2 on the way - the filmmakers will get it right.Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively make a great couple onscreen - but so much more could have been done in the scripting department to heighten the stakes - yes, we have an alien who wants to destroy our planet, but just how, why and huh?  Blake Lively floating in the air with a needle pointed at her neck (ok a spoiler) - doesn't quite make me shake in my seat.

Factoring in Green Lantern's recent resurgence as a relevant figure in the DC universe, I expected more out of this film. I don't mean the special effects, which I thought were mostly fine. Thing of it is, those unfamiliar with the Green Lantern Corps and its cosmic mythology will probably benefit more from the viewing, because it's all fresh and new to 'em. GL is essentially an intergalactic police officer, and that's a cool hook. But if you're a longtime reader of Green Lantern, then this may not be the movie you've been clamoring for. Oh, the respectful treatment is there. I do believe the filmmakers tried their best to be true to the subject matter. But why must the narrative come off so clunky? I actually have friends who read the comic book and they're pumped up after watching the thing. So mileage may vary; it may vary a lot.I don't believe this to be as bad as the professional critics are intimating (intimating... hell, they're shouting the film's suckiness from the roof tops). But it's not about to make anyone forget about THE DARK KNIGHT or even X-MEN: FIRST CLASS. I think it rates about 2.5 out of 5 stars, which means it's an average film. Again, the film tries so hard to be true to the source material, and maybe that focus became too narrow a beam. There's such a painstaking attempt to lay down the groundwork - whether it's informing us of the grand-scaled Green Lantern Corps mythos or of Hal Jordan's more personal narrative - that it forgets to breathe life into the story. The film is flat. Blame the lazy writing, the tedious exposition, the lame dialogue. When Hal Jordan passionately pleads with the Guardians for a chance to defend his planet - but then Hal's big closing sales pitch is the ""we're only human"" speech - one Guardian actually has the gall to declare his argument ""compelling."" This Guardian probably has Ben Stein as a Friend on his Facebook.Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds, and he's played him better. It's as if the dying Abin Sur crashlanded on Earth, instructed his ring to seek his rightful successor, and the ring then came back with Van Wilder. I never once bought Reynolds as cocky test pilot Hal Jordan. It doesn't help that the film makes Jordan into a mopey character. The Hal Jordan I'm familiar with wouldn't get all whiny and decide he's not cut out for the Corps after only a brief session with Kilowog and one beatdown from Sinestro. And then there's the patented Ryan Reynolds comedy schtick. Sometimes gimmick casting works, sometimes nope. It certainly did with Downey, Jr. as Iron Man, but as much as I enjoy Ryan Reynolds, I would have to label his Hal Jordan as a fail. I've a feeling he'll do better as Deadpool, a character much more suited to his glib persona. By the way, I'm now officially more concerned about Chris Evans as Captain America.The fear-consuming Parallax as the Big Bad is a Big Bad Choice, especially as how he's so poorly designed, all tentacly and amorphous and cloudy and looking like poo. I didn't want to call the Green Lantern Corps. I wanted to call the housemaid for clean-up on Sector 2814. And Imhotep called. He wants his blurry face back. Meanwhile, Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) comes off pretty pathetic here, that poor nebbish (yet creepy) xenobiologist. As if Hammond weren't comfortable enough in his own skin, damn if he doesn't get infected with Parallax's yellow fear juice and begins warping into a freakish funhouse mirror version of himself. This doesn't improve his chances with the lovely Carol Ferris. Hammond becomes so grotesque that even John Merrick just handed him a brown paper bag with eyeholes cut out. On the bright side, he develops telekinesis and he can now read people's minds. Because what he really needs right now is to eavesdrop on what people think of his new, ridiculously fugly figure. Hector Hammond also screams like a girl, which validates my earliest impression of him.Now Blake Lively is worth ogling. I clung to that grimly as I watched her not have chemistry with Reynolds, as I watched her be bland in her role of Carol Ferris (who, granted, even in the comic books, had always been dull as dictionaries). Her and Reynold's romance seems forced, although not as forced as Thor and Jane Foster's thing in their movie. Still, whenever their feeble courtship is shoved up front and center, things come to a screeching halt. Their banter is pretty weak.Not that the film doesn't have its good bits. For one, I love how green energy would course along those lines on Hal's costume. But I despise the mask.Hal's ring constructs are marked by a distinct lack of imagination. Seriously, a race car?How did Hal know to show up just in time for his first big throwdown with Hector Hammond?I gaze at the ancient Guardians of the Universe, those blue midgets, as they pass judgment on everyone and everything from atop their lofty pillars of stone in their citadel, and I wonder how they go about their bathroom breaks.The sense I get is that Amanda Waller is being groomed to be DC's version of Nick Fury. By the way, it doesn't seem right that CCH Pounder isn't playing her.My favorite moment may be that scene in which Green Lantern visits Carol Ferris at her apartment after having just saved her life. What happens there may be the single most clever thing the film accomplishes. I liked the cameos by Abin Sur, Kilowog, Tomar Re, and Sinestro. Mark Strong, I thought, was the most impressive actor here. He is regal and works perfectly as Hal's militant foil. It would've been something to see Sinestro finally turn that corner, become the vile villain he was meant to be. But with the way this film's come all ha1fassed, I don't know if there'll be a sequel. Still, you should stick around for the teaser scene during the closer credits which introduces further developments. That is, if you hadn't walked out of the theater already.",3,"""You reek of fear, Hal Jordan,"" accuses Sinestro.

1403424,A3N0AXNEZVE686,B004EPZ07K,Hound Dog,"[4, 5]","I first discovered Hal Jordan/Green Lantern on the animated ""Challenge of the Super Friends"" in the late 1970's.  At the time, Harrison Ford (circa 1980's ""The Empire Strikes Back"") was my perfect choice for Green Lantern's live-action movie adaptation someday.  In the summer of 2011, Warner Bros. & DC Comics finally produce a Green Lantern film, leaving audiences to settle for Ryan Reynolds as the title character.  Of available young actors, yes, either he or, better yet, Chris Pine were arguably the best known options.  Reynolds subsequently fails to impress in an estimated $300 million production (upon factoring in the promotional costs).  His lackluster efforts are further deep-sixed by a crummy script and gaudy, unconvincing CGI special effects that imbue this vastly disappointing movie with all the aura of a big-screen video game.Director Martin Campbell seemed a logical choice to initiate ""Green Lantern"" into a super-hero film franchise.  Having seen his high octane efforts resurrecting Zorro (with Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones) and James Bond twice (with Pierce Brosnan and later Daniel Craig), Campbell typically has a knack of capturing sleek, inspired performances from his actors.  This time, though, I strongly suspect the extensive computer-generated imagery (CGI) component must have overwhelmed Campbell.  Case in point: the performance quality is virtually non-existent, including a badly miscast Blake Lively as Hal Jordan's love interest, fellow pilot, and boss, Carol Ferris.  Mediocre acting aside, ""Green Lantern"" under Campbell's supervision falls miserably short of the same depth that inspired directors Richard Donner and Christopher Nolan brought to the ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" franchises.  As the movie's script incoherently blends elements from various Green Lantern comic storylines, the target PG-13 audience here is clearly undemanding viewers in the 12-25 crowd.The film immediately makes a major error with its ""Battlestar Galactica""-like voice-over prologue (which is Geoffrey Rush's voice, but it eerily sounds almost exactly like Patrick Macnee's voice from ""Galactica"") that explains too much too soon.  Without revealing crucial spoilers, the filmmakers should have saved revelations about planet Oa's existence and the Green Lantern Corps for a proposed sequel.  There wasn't enough screen time to sufficiently develop Parallax, Hector Hammond, and even Sinestro into villains all in one film.  Although the idea was to wisely set up an awesome Green Lantern vs. Sinestro sequel, the combination of such a bad script with an over-abundance of obviously fake CGI makes for a dreadful viewing experience.  As a result, Hal Jordan's updated origin as a rookie Green Lantern becomes simply underwhelming.  If the film had plausibly concentrated on a raw, mysterious origin (where, say, Hal desperately believes he is the only Green Lantern vs. imminent cosmic destruction), the end result may have been far better.  In all fairness, one of the movie's few assets in exploring Green Lantern's origin is the inclusion of reliable actors in various supporting roles: the late Michael Clarke Duncan, Geoffrey Rush, Clancy Brown, Angela Bassett, Jay O. Sanders, Jon Tenney, and Tim Robbins.  Unfortunately, the mind-numbing script gives them franchise characters (i.e. Kilowog, Tomar-Re, Amanda Waller, Abin Sur, and the Jordan family) with so little to do.Thee movie's worst offense, ultimately, is its pushing of flashy style over substance.  In the first ten minutes (even before Reynolds' first appearance), you will see exactly what I mean.  The galaxy or the planetary scenes don't even try to appear remotely realistic.  One can further sense the movie is in deep trouble early on when even Hal and Carol's jets flying in the California desert are obviously just CGI effects.  Utilizing models (or even recycling stock footage of actual jets from ""Top Gun"") would have been far more credible.  At that point, viewers will recognize they are watching actors lazily going through the motions, treating ""Green Lantern"" merely as a paycheck movie.  Frankly, unlike Reynolds, Howard Murphy (the first live-action Green Lantern), appearing on the two horribly campy ""Challenge of the Super Heroes"" TV specials back in January 1979, at least tried acting the part.  As the cast fails to convince viewers to suspend total disbelief, the total reliance on CGI becomes sadly apparent.  Hence, the film proceeds to waste a very expensive series of optical illusions resulting in nothing more real than an emerald fireworks show.Overall, the reviews I had read prior to viewing ""Green Lantern"" were pretty fair.  Even before seeing the film, I had read about rumors of a possible, scaled-down sequel in the works.  Considering the insane amount of money Warner Bros lost (as the film probably didn't break even), the idea seems laughable.  Yet, no matter how improbable, any ""Green Lantern"" sequel (or, far more likely, a reboot) requires four major upgrades: 1. Find the right Hal Jordan (perhaps Garrett Hedlund); 2. The actors must provide high-caliber performances; 2. Hire a compatible director (someone who actually grasps why a fearless Hal Jordan is Green Lantern); and 3. Far more time and effort is concentrated on a vastly improved script rather than simply gambling it all on gaudy CGI.Despite better judgment, I still bought the blu-ray at a cheap price to enjoy it with my young son.  If only once, we both could be kids gleefully watching my favorite childhood super-hero come to life.  I just wish ""Green Lantern"" had been far, far better.Rating: 4/10 (Note: There are two gruesome scenes inside a secret laboratory in the film's second half that I would advise not letting children see -- parents will know when they watch the film).",2,Green Lantern 2011 - A CGI Video Game Disguised as a Barely Watchable Movie,1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,5804,"['first', 'discovered', 'Hal',

He in fact has always been my favourite Superhero.Having read a number of reviews, I expected the worst and so was pleasantly surprised.It's a good fun movie. It provides a relatively quick background (unlike Captain America which went too long I thought) and gets us into the action pretty quickly. Ryan Reynolds was a good casting of Hal Jordan and I thought he did a great job and didn't take himself to seriously.I thought the movie was let down by the ""bad guy"", a ""yellow fear"" of a moving mass that consumes all in its path.

1403426,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B004EPZ07K,Ian,"[4, 9]","2011 will probably be best remembered as the year when Marvel superheroes once again stormed the silver screen and further built upon their wildly successful fictional universe. In a way, it's easy to feel a little sad for DC, who, aside from Batman, hasn't had much luck with their own superheroes as of late. Thus, ""Green Lantern"" represents their own foray into the superhero film. But while a lot of time and effort was obviously put into the film, the finished product doesn't quite live up to it's full potential.""Green Lantern"" follows the story of Hal Jordon, test pilot extraordinaire, who excels at taking risks and doing the things no on else will. It's this daredevil attitude that leads him to a mysterious power ring that recruits him into the intergalactic peace keepers known as the Green Lantern Corps, who's members are said to be above fear. But while he has gained an extraordinary gift and an awesome responsibility, Hal must now deal not only with the threat of an intergalactic being who could destroy everything he holds dear, but also his own failings, which hold him back from being truly great.When you really look at it, ""Green Lantern"" is a typical superhero origin film, with great visuals, some nifty action scenes, a healthy dose of humor, and a good message about learning to overcome fear. I also really liked the scenes on Oa, where Hal learns about the corps, and starts training to become one, which are easily the most entertaining parts of the film. But while all the elements for a great movie are present, ""Green Lantern"" feels like a puzzle where all the pieces don't quite fit together. Among these are secondary villain Hector Hammond, who has an interesting character arc, but is essentially a placeholder for the main bad guy, and ultimately feels unnecessary. There's also a light love story, but Hal's girlfriend ultimately contributes little to the story.  But what I felt to be the weakest element of the film lay in Hal working to overcome his own personal doubts, because he can't seem to make up his mind about what he's most afraid of (his father's death, or his insecurity about commitment). By the time the final battle began, I wasn't emotionally interested because it didn't feel like Hal had overcome a crippling personal problem. He just felt like a guy in a green costume with magical powers.Overall, ""Green Lantern"" is strong in terms of visuals and humor (Hal's first attempt at reciting the famous oath is quite amusing, as are the jokes about his facemask), and the world of the Green Lanterns themselves is fascinating, but with the emotional backbone of the movie compromised, everything else feels fragmented. There are parts that definitely work, but had the emotional core had been smoothed out and clarified a bit more, ""Green Lantern"" could have been a lot better then it is.",3,A cracked lantern,1308268800,"06 17, 2011",2011,2847,"['2011', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'best', 'remembered', 'year', 'when', 'Marvel', 'once', 'again', 'stormed', 'silver', 'screen', 'further', 'built', 'wildly', 'successful', 'fictional', 'universe', 'way', 'easy', 'feel', 'little', 'sad', 'DC', 'who', 'aside', 'Batman', ""n't"", 'had', 'much', 'luck', 'own', 'superheroes', 'late', 'Thus', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'own', 'foray', 'superhero', 'film', 'lot', 'time', 'effort', 'was', 'obviously', 'put', 'film', 'finished', 'product', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'full', 'potential', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'story', 'Hal', 'Jordon', 'test', 'pilot', 'extraordinaire', 'who', 'taking', 'risks', 'doing', 'things', 'else', 'will', 'daredevil', 'attitude', 'mysterious', 'power', 'ring', 'intergalactic', 'peace', 'keepers', 'known', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Corps', 'who', 'members', 'are', 'said', 'be', 'fear', 'gained', 'extraordinary', 'gift', 'awesome', 'responsibility', 'Hal', 'must', 'now', 'deal', 'not', 'only', 'threat', 'intergalactic', 'being', 'who', 'could', 'destroy', 'everything', 'dear', 'also', 'own', 'failings', 'hold', 'back', 'being', 'truly', 'great.When', 'really', 'look', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'typical', 'superhero', 'origin', 'film', 'great', 'visuals', 'nifty', 'action', 'scenes', 'healthy', 'dose', 'humor', 'good', 'message', 'learning', 'overcome', 'fear', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'scenes', 'Oa', 'where', 'Hal', 'corps', 'training', 'become', 'one', 'are', 'easily', 'most', 'entertaining', 'parts', 'film', 'elements', 'great', 'movie', 'are', 'present', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'feels', 'puzzle', 'where', 'pieces', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'together', 'are', 'secondary', 'villain', 'Hector', 'Hammond', 'who', 'interesting', 'character', 'arc', 'essentially', 'placeholder', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'ultimately', 'feels', 'unnecessary', 'also', 'light', 'love', 'story', 'Hal', 'girlfriend', 'ultimately', 'little', 'story', 'what', 'felt', 'be', 'weakest', 'element', 'film', 'lay', 'Hal', 'working', 'overcome', 'own', 'personal', 'doubts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'most', 'afraid', 'father', 'death', 'insecurity', 'commitment', 'time', 'final', 'battle', 'began', 'was', ""n't"", 'emotionally', 'interested', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Hal', 'had', 'overcome', 'crippling', 'personal', 'problem', 'just', 'felt', 'guy', 'green', 'costume', 'magical', 'powers.Overall', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'strong', 'terms', 'visuals', 'humor', 'Hal', 'first', 'attempt', 'reciting', 'famous', 'oath', 'quite', 'amusing', 'are', 'jokes', 'facemask', 'world', 'Green', 'Lanterns', 'fascinating', 'emotional', 'backbone', 'movie', 'compromised', 'everything', 'else', 'feels', 'fragmented', 'are', 'parts', 'definitely', 'work', 'had', 'emotional', 'core', 'had', 'been', 'smoothed', 'out', 'clarified', 'bit', 'more', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'then']",Green Lantern

1403444,A2PUA6GJJJQKTD,B004EPZ07K,Jay Chen,"[1, 2]","Green Lantern is a study in how not to adapt a comic book hero to film.  The way they portray the Green Lantern's powers remind me a a lot of The Mask -- you know, all those goofy scenes when the Mask pulls out a giant-sized animated Tommy gun and starts mowing down all the bad guys.  In Mask, it's funny.  I'm just not sure they were going for funny with Green Lantern.  Very cartoonish.There are a few points along the way when the plot picks up and it's actually pretty entertaining.  The basic storyline starts (no spoilers) with a dying alien who passes on his special powers to a human.  This human, who doesn't really understand what has happened to him, suddenly finds himself in the middle of an intergalactic battle.  The villain is actually entertaining, and the ""other world"" had some real potential too.  There is actually a pretty good backstory that starts to develop.  The problem is that the story keeps lapsing back into those bizarre animated sequences and you find yourself dropping straight out of movie.The casting was weak too and the Green Lantern's costume was awful.  Now, I know it's odd to comment on something like a costume, but you can't help but notice.  When Green Lantern puts on his mask and tights, he doesn't look cool at all.  I found myself have flashbacks to Will Ferrell in Elf.

1403446,A20IPZQ38M96RB,B004EPZ07K,J. Bakker,"[4, 11]","Check out the full review at Metal Arcade DOT NetBe aware that this review may contain some spoilers. DC Comics' Green Lantern makes his long awaited debut on the big screen. So how did it pan out?Not too great. I went into this movie with very low expectations based on the bad word of mouth it had been receiving. The movie never blew away those low expectations, either.Ryan Reynolds stars in this Martin Campbell (Casino Royale) directed, effects driven romp as Hal Jordan, the first ever human chosen to join the ranks of the Green Lantern Corps.Hal is a reckless, cocky pilot when the movie starts, and he seems to have pissed off most of the people in his life who care about him. Shortly after an accident causes him to lose his job, Hal encounters a dying alien named Abin Sur, who passes the Green Lantern torch to him before he dies, saying that the ring chose him as his successor. A Green Lantern must be responsible and fearless, and so Hal thinks that the ring has made a big mistake in choosing him.After the ring is bonded to him, Hal is sent to the Lantern's home world of Oa. It is there that he meets Sinestro, a great warrior who is resentful of Hal, whom he believes is unworthy of the legendary Abin Sur's ring. He is also greeted by Kilowog (Michael Clarke Duncan), a giant beast of a drill instructor, and the intellectual Tomar-Re (Geoffrey Rush). He is beaten down by Kilowog's harsh training and Sinestro's down-talking, and after being pushed too far, he quits, saying that the ring made a mistake in choosing him.Back on Earth, Hector Hammond (played by a nigh-unrecognizable Peter Skarsgaard), a highly intelligent professor and son of a senator (Tim Robbins), is visited by the government, who wants him to study the alien Abin Sur's body. While examining the body, he is infected by the fear energy that killed Abin Sur, by way of Parallax, a dumb looking Galactus ripoff, fueled by terrible CGI. Hal must overcome his fears of the past, his memories of his dead father's terrible plane crash, and now Hector and Galactus... erm, Parallax, if he's to make Sinestro proud and live up to his hype as a Lantern.The movie itself, however, far from lives up to its hype. With a director like Martin Campbell, who revitalized the aging James Bond franchise, you would think the movie was in good hands. However, this movie is just one more in the long line of 3-D driven special effects spectacles that try to cover up the film's lack of true substance and story. As you could probably tell from my long winded retelling of the film's setup, the story is terribly confusing, with too much going on, too many characters and too much CGI to distract you. This is DC's version of X-Men: The Last Stand (an arguably better movie).The CGI in the movie ranges from terrible to amazing. The time spent on the planet Oa, home of the Lanterns, is arguably the most well done, with thousands of cool looking alien species serving as Corps members and a beautiful skyline. Hal's training on Oa is by far the most interesting visually and story-wise. It's a shame Hal's time on Oa only accounts for about 15 minutes of this movie.Once Hector Hammond makes his debut as a dumb looking giant-headed, ugly ass guy in a wheelchair, the film becomes plain laughable. His character is far from intimidating, and I can't understand why they decided to put him in the movie. Near the end of the film he reveals his feelings for Hal's girl Carol (Blake Lively) and how he's despised Hal since they were kids- which seems thrown in at the last minute since the film makes no mention that they all grew up together. Sarsgaard's performance is hammy and terrible, and you just want his character to die a horrible death form the moment you see him. You'll understand once you see the film- he pretty much just wastes all the time he was onscreen, which could have been much better served on the awesome looking planet Oa.Likewise, the main villain, Parallax, is dumb, stupid looking, and not as intimidating as everyone in the movie makes him out to be. The final confrontation between Hal and this absurd looking villain could have been a great opportunity to showcase the cool looking ranks of the Green Lantern Corps, but I guess they ran out of CGI money there or something, because even Parallax himself looks like he was created by a budget, basement CGI team normally used for Sy-Fi channel garbage.Some people were complaining about Ryan Reynolds being cast in the role of Hal Jordan, but he is bar none the best thing in the movie. He is the only character you actually care about, and his acting ability and charisma are the only thing keeping this film from being totally unwatchable. Blake Lively is pretty good in her role, which doesn't give her much to do besides look pretty and have one cool Top-Gun style flight sequence in the beginning of the film.There are so many things wrong with this movie that I can't detail them all, even in this now close to 1000 word review. It isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, however Hal Jordan, one of DC's few well-respected characters, deserved much better. As it stands, Batman is still the only DC character with movies worthy of his comic pedigree, and that's a real shame.",2,Worse than I expected.,1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,5236,"['Check', 'out',

1403460,A4GPHAI2LRIQI,B004EPZ07K,"JJD ""John""","[5, 8]","I'll preface my comments by stating that I have been a fan of Green Lantern from early on in life. In 1989, around the time Batman was breaking box office records with Tim Burton's epic, DC had released a mini series called ""Green Lantern: Emerald Dawn"". At the time, like much of the world, I was in FULL Batman insanity and saw that film five times theatrically. However, as a GL fan, I decided to pick up the series and read it multiple times with a single thought..how AWESOME would a Green Lantern movie be??? The ingredients for a grandiose space epic were all there. A corps of aliens from multiple galaxies defending the universe, a cocky test pilot with a few human faults to overcome, these seemed like the perfect ingredients for not one, but MULTIPLE films. I even envisioned a collaboration between Richard Donner (director of arguably the greatest super hero movie of all time SUPERMAN (1978)) and Jim Henson's creature shop making several significant Corps members.The point is..this is NOT a character you can simply try to base in any realm of reality. This is why critics have been merciless with this film.Is it without fault, absolutely not. I think Geoff Johns should have stepped down as producer and simply provided a screenplay that is on a level with his wonderfully written origin story from a few years ago, which brought GL back into the forefront of the DC universe.Getting back to the subject at hand, it is a FUN movie. The CGI serves it's purpose here. I enjoyed the fact that they even made Hal's uniform CGI because, as any GL novice would know, it's a construct of the ring's energy. The pacing is fine and didn't bore me in the least. It's an origin story and you have to give some fair amount of exposition in the film. Blake Lively, as Carol Ferris, was good..but a bit young for the role. Ryan Reynolds comes off a bit like his usual self at the beginning, but by the end of the film..he IS Hal Jordan. Mark Strong's Sinestro is PERFECT, and choosing Geoffrey Rush and Michael Clark Duncan as Tomar Re and Kilowog were inspired voice casting choices. I would certainly put this on the same level as Tim Burton's 1989 classic interpretation of Batman. I would even go so far as to say it's BETTER. Batman focused too much on Jack Nicholson's Joker (with his salary, I can see why)and not enough Batman action. This has GL action in spades and after more than 20 years waiting to see this character on the silver screen, it was good enough for me. My only hope is that this film does well enough to warrant a sequel. It certainly deserves one and with the origin out of the way...bring on the space epic we're all anxious to see.It's not a perfect film, but neither were Flash Gordon, Dune, Big Trouble In Little China, and any number of now ""classic"" movies that all fall into the category of ""critical failures/fan favorites"". For two hours, my imagination was pleasantly occupied and I felt like a kid again. It's Green Lantern...not Othello or War And Peace. It's as fun as Iron Man and no less plausible than a guy that can make a suit of armor from scraps in an Afghan cave and power it with a tiny generator built into his chest. While Nolan's Batman films were critical darlings (The Dark Knight in particular)at times they are not at all fun to watch and tend to take themselves far too seriously. I'm not saying the Nolan films aren't great..but they are from a different approach. You can't approach this character on the same level because it's a SPACE hero and not an urban crimefighter with no powers, but a wealth of resources and the funding at his disposal.To sum it all up...we have enough ""reality"" to deal with every day and, these days, much of it is unpleasant to think about. Having seen this film twice now, I can honestly say that I was entertained and had a lot fun watching one of my childhood heroes come to life. This was the most fun I've had at the movies in a LONG time...and I can't wait to see more.",4,On the same level as Tim Burton's Batman (1989),1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,3970,"[""'ll"", 'preface', 'comments', 'stating', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'early', 'life', '1989', 'time', 'Batman', 'was', 'breaking', 'box', 'office', 'records', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'epic', 'DC', 'had', 'released', 'mini', 'series', 'called', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Emerald', 'Dawn', 'time', 'much', 'world', 'was', 'FULL', 'Batman', 'insanity', 'saw', 'film', 'five', 'times', 'theatrically', 'However', 'GL', 'fan', 'decided', 'pick', 'up', 'series', 'read', 'multiple', 'times', 'single', 'thought..how', 'AWESOME', 'would', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'movie', 'be', 'ingredients', 'grandiose', 'space', 'epic', 'were', 'there', 'corps', 'aliens', 'multiple', 'galaxies', 'defending', 'universe', 'cocky', 'test', 'pilot', 'few', 'human', 'faults', 'overcome', 'seemed', 'perfect', 'ingredients', 'not', 'one', 'MULTIPLE', 'films', 'even', 'envisioned', 'collaboration', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'director', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'super', 'hero', 'movie', 'time', 'SUPERMAN', '1978', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'creature', 'shop', 'making', 'several', 'significant', 'Corps', 'members.The', 'point', 'is..this', 'NOT', 'character', 'can', 'simply', 'try', 'base', 'realm', 'reality', 'why', 'critics', 'have', 'been', 'merciless', 'film.Is', 'fault', 'absolutely', 'not', 'think', 'Geoff', 'Johns', 'should', 'have', 'stepped', 'down', 'producer', 'simply', 'provided', 'screenplay', 'level', 'wonderfully', 'written', 'origin', 'story', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'brought', 'GL', 'back', 'forefront', 'DC', 'universe.Getting', 'back', 'subject', 'hand', 'FUN', 'movie', 'CGI', 'purpose', 'here', 'enjoyed', 'fact', 'even', 'made', 'Hal', 'uniform', 'CGI', 'because', 'GL', 'novice', 'would', 'know', 'construct', 'ring', 'energy', 'pacing', 'fine', 'did', ""n't"", 'bore', 'least', 'origin', 'story', 'have', 'give', 'fair', 'amount', 'exposition', 'film', 'Blake', 'Lively', 'Carol', 'Ferris', 'was', 'good..but', 'bit', 'young', 'role', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'off', 'bit', 'usual', 'self', 'beginning', 'end', 'film..he', 'IS', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'Sinestro', 'PERFECT', 'choosing', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Michael', 'Clark', 'Duncan', 'Tomar', 'Re', 'Kilowog', 'were', 'inspired', 'voice', 'casting', 'choices', 'would', 'certainly', 'put', 'same', 'level', 'Tim', 'Burton', '1989', 'classic', 'interpretation', 'Batman', 'would', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'BETTER', 'Batman', 'focused', 'too', 'much', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Joker', 'salary', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'not', 'enough', 'Batman', 'action', 'GL', 'action', 'spades', 'more', '20', 'years', 'waiting', 'see', 'character', 'silver', 'screen', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'only', 'hope', 'film', 'well', 'enough', 'warrant', 'sequel', 'certainly', 'one', 'origin', 'way', 'bring', 'space', 'epic', ""'re"", 'anxious', 'see.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'were', 'Flash', 'Gordon', 'Dune', 'Big', 'Trouble', 'Little', 'China', 'number', 'now', 'classic', 'movies', 'fall', 'category', 'critical', 'failures/fan', 'favorites', 'two', 'hours', 'imagination', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'occupied', 'felt', 'kid', 'again', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'not', 'Othello', 'War', 'Peace', 'as', 'fun', 'Iron', 'Man', 'less', 'plausible', 'guy', 'can', 'make', 'suit', 'armor', 'scraps', 'Afghan', 'cave', 'power', 'tiny', 'generator', 'built', 'chest', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'films', 'were', 'critical', 'darlings', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'particular', 'times', 'are', 'not', 'fun', 'watch', 'tend', 'take', 'far', 'too', 'seriously', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Nolan', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'great..but', 'are', 'different', 'approach', 'ca', ""n't"", 'approach', 'character', 'same', 'level', 'SPACE', 'hero', 'not', 'urban', 'crimefighter', 'powers', 'wealth', 'resources', 'funding', 'disposal.To', 'sum', 'up', 'have', 'enough', 'reality', 'deal', 'day', 'days', 'much', 'unpleasant', 'think', 'Having', 'seen', 'film', 'twice', 'now', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'was', 'entertained', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'watching', 'one', 'childhood', 'heroes', 'come', 'life', 'was', 'most', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'had', 'movies', 'LONG', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'more']",Green Lantern

1403463,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B004EPZ07K,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[7, 14]","Let me say I've never read the Green Lantern comic when I did read and collect them. I was never really interested in DC comics. The just didn't have compelling characters outside of Batman and I only started reading Batman after I saw the movie back in 1989. Right now I can't name any of the major hero's from DC outside of Batman, Superman, and Wonderwoman. I can name Flash also but that's only because of the TV series that came out back and 1990 which was a good show. I think that's the problem with DC comics as a whole their hero's aren't as well known or recognized outside of the big two Batman/Superman while Marvel has many likable and recognizable characters like Captain America, Spiderman, Wolverine, Daredevil, to name a few and even a lesser know character like the Punisher is probably better known than the majority of the hero's/Villains in DC comics. So I don't think there will be many who truly enjoy this movie outside of the ones who read the comic.Now I don't want you to think this is the worst comic book movie out there but it is the worst of the this summer by far. But there have been worst. The Fantastic Four movie that was never released. I have a friend who has a VHS copy of the movie and the movie is the worst comic book movie I've seen. Jonah Hex, Catwoman, Ghost Rider, Punisher: War Zone to name a few of the terrible ones. No I'd but Green Lantern on the level of the first newer Fantastic Four movie which was bad but not horrible.Now that I put you in a downer about Green Lantern I'll go on about what I did like.I like that DC and Warner Brothers took a chance with this character. Since reading into the back history of the character he has to travel to other planets and fight in space. So this is the first comic book movie I can think of that takes place much of the film in space. It's a risk I don't think many movie studio's or Marvel will risk right now. So I need to give DC and WB credit for taking a chance on some levels it worked well. For example in taking us to a alien world and introducing us to alien Green Lanterns. I'll get to what I didn't like about this later on in my review.Next I liked Ryan Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively. Ryan Reynolds(Hal Jordan) is a good but not great actor who has done mostly comedies. He does bring life to Hal Jordan but the writing and script didn't help him much. After seeing this movie I'd have preferred if he had done DEADPOOL. I think he was born to do that character but I don't know if it's going to happen. I hope after this movie bombs which I'm pretty sure it will studio's will still give him a chance to star. Then there's Blake Lively(Carol Ferris) who plays Hal's love interest. Again she is hampered by the bad script but she still brings her beauty and charisma along with her acting talent to this film to brighten it up. She's one of the few bright spots in the show Gossip Girl and was outstanding in THE TOWN. Sadly these are the only two characters who are the least bit interesting.Finally there's the special effects which were good but not great. Going into this movie I thought from trailers this would be the worst part but I was wrong the effects were pretty good. The worlds I saw were believable and the alien characters looked alive.Now onto the what I didn't like.There is the story/writing of the movie. You won't understand anything if you haven't read the comic. Outside the Narration in the beginning you don't get anything. Not details on who the Lantern's are or who the immortal guardians are and this supposed great evil in Parallax. Then there is the high school script and dialogue is out of a a student film you'd expect a child to write. That's how bad it was some of the lines were laughable when they were clearly not intended to be. Finally there's the two useless bad guys which were uninteresting and weren't really that bad or at least didn't seem that bad. Loki and Sebastian Shaw in Thor and X-Men: First Class seem more alive and evil than the two bad guys in this film combined.Now we go to all the useless actors in the film. Tim Robbins(Senator Hammond) is a ghost in this film as you won't remember him once he's gone along with virtually all the other actors except for the two I mentioned above. That includes Angela Bassett(Dr. Amanda Waller), Jay O. Sanders(Carl Ferris), Geoffrey Rush(Voice of Tomar-Re), and Michael Clarke Duncan(Voice of Kilowog) to name a few. Then there is Peter Sarsgaard(Hector Hammond) who I guess was supposed to be tortured soul/villain but he was uninteresting and unlikable and wasn't much of a villain. Finally there is Mark Strong(Sinestro). Mark is a good actor and makes a good villain. Sadly he was underused in this film and I wish he had been the bad guy and I hoped he would have been when the guardians gave him a yellow ring. Unfortunately it wasn't to be and we were stuck with Hammond and Parallax.You'd think the action and special effects would coincide with each other but the don't with this film. While the special effects were pretty good the action was terrible and downright boring. I heard this movie cost around 175 million to make and you'd think with that much of a budget they'd have better action. I can't think of one good action scene in this film and the climax where Parallax invades earth and chases Hal Jordan around the solar system is terribleThe last thing I'll talk about is the score/soundtrack which there isn't one or at least I didn't notice one. I think this film would have been helped out by a good score/soundtrack.I was hoping this movie would take place entire ally in space. I would love to have seen a superhero Star Wars type of film. I think it could have worked that way with a better bad guy and better writings. They studio had the budget for it and I'd like to know what they spent all that money on because the couldn't have used it all on this film judging by the finished project.Overall a bad film but not a terrible one. I have no doubt this will be the worst superhero film of the summer and one of the worst I've seen but no the worst. So I'd skip it and if you need a superhero fix go see THOR, X-MEN: FIRST CLASS or wait for Captain America. This film isn't worth your time or the money you'll spend on it.",2,The Worst Superhero Film Of the Summer.,1308268800,"06 17, 2011",2011,6258,"['Let', 'say', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Green',

I rented this because I was curious about some of the positive reviews here and elsewhere. OK, I rented the disk from a local Blockbuster, took it home, popped a bag of corn, got a beer out the fridge and settled in expecting, if not a great or even a good movie, a movie that could hold my attention for an hour or so.Not. First, no need to give a synopsis as this page pretty well sums it up. What turned me off to this story, this film, is that it looked too much like a cartoon. The cg in this film looked cheap and cheesy a la Phantom Menace Mars Attacks cheesy. And the story was simply too familiar to involve myself in. The dialogue was flat. The heroic moments in the film where I am supposed to cheer and pump my fists left me cringing in embarrassment. This film just didn't have anything absolutely zero going for it at all. There's one scene where a helicopter is sliding through a group of people at this party. You'd think someone would have been killed by the spinning propeller blades but miraculously no one does and at the last minute our  hero Green lantern and his magic ring saves the day by catching the plane in a green hotrod and diverting it out of harms way. Then, as a spectator is catching him on her camera phone, our hero, a la Superman 1, flies away.I've been watching this movie a chapter a day for the past 2 weeks because I can't sit through the whole thing.

Like most Hollywood movies these days, it is more spectacle than substance. It is an exercise in CG special effects rather than good story-telling. Character development is paper-thin and the plot has too many clich&eacute;s.The hero is a handsome hunk for whom things seem to work out no matter how reckless he behaves and can get any girl he wants. The villain is a disfigured balding intellectual who is not even liked by his own father and of course has absolutely no chance of getting the girl or any girl for that matter. (What has Hollywood got against intellectuals anyway? A bookish boy who studies hard his whole life has a much better chance of being successful in real life than a guy who simply breezes through it on reckless stunts.)The central idea of this movie that fear is the ultimate evil is childishly simplistic and absurd. Fear can be good. Fear of getting hurt is what keeps us from taking stupid risks; fear of being punished is what keeps (most) people from breaking rules etc. If there was absolutely no fear we'd all be jumping off cliffs.

1403471,AXOO7BPM22BDO,B004EPZ07K,"John Green ""Darkwriter""","[9, 17]","Green Lantern hits theaters today, directed by Martin Campbell and starring Ryan Reynolds in the title role, along with Blake Lively (Carol Ferris), Peter Sarsgaard (Hector Hammond) and Mark Strong (Sinestro). It's written by Greg Berlanti, Michael Green, Marc Guggenheim and Michael Goldenberg and after seeing it I have one burning question: it really took four people to write this?You oughta know the plot by now: Hal Jordan, test pilot extraordinaire, gets chosen by dying legendary Green Lantern Abin Sur to replace him in the ranks.  As both the first human ever chosen and the bearer of Abin Sur's legacy, Hal has a lot to prove to his new comrades.  But the same galactic threat that killed his predecessor is still out there, giving Hal the opportunity to earn his stripes.The basic premise of the franchise remains intact, but only barely.  If you were unfamiliar with the comic you wouldn't know a whole lot more after seeing this.  What's presented here is disjointed, choppy and kind of dull, and I've never really understood the need for comic book movies to deviate so wildly from the established material.  The villain Parallax is a bastardized version of two DC characters, which is silly since if they used the one they borrowed from the most- Krona- you'd have practically the same story.  The origins and personalities of the Green Lantern Corps are the richest parts of the story- and one of the best in comics- and they all get shorted big time.  The Guardians of the Universe, elder beings and creators of the Lantern Corps, are just a bunch of big-headed blue sourpusses sitting around in the dark.  We're never shown what's so special about being a Lantern or why Abin Sur was so revered- Hal may as well have gotten the ring from a Cracker Jacks box for all the honor and responsibility he's supposed to shoulder.The opening sequence is a straight rip-off of last year's Clash of the Titans intro- with the whole half-hearted exposition delivered over space vistas highlighted by mock-ups of key figures and events.  Foreshadowing seems to be the order of the day in this film: at his brother's house Hal briefly plays with his nephew's Hot Wheels racing set, so guess what he creates in his debut appearance to stop a helicopter crash?  During Hal's indoctrination on Oa, Kilowog mentions out of nowhere something about the gravity pull of a sun, so in the big finale against Parallax... And somehow- I'm still not sure how- Sinestro convinces the Guardians to create a Yellow Ring based on the energy Parallax uses to combat him even though they mistrust and fear its power.  *sigh*Four guys, huh?Characters are just ok.  Hal is portrayed mostly as the boy who never quite grew up- which he was never portrayed as in the comics, so why now? Carol Ferris, his love interest, is actually more interesting than he is, but since she's not the main character...  Sinestro is given a little bit of rein to show why he's the Guardians' go-to guy, but doesn't have nearly enough screen time, not to mention how they seem to have completely screwed up his story arc.  I won't spoil it but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt- for now.  Likewise with Kilowog and Tomar-Re- two staples of the franchise that are relegated to bit players.  And the Hector Hammond storyline was completely useless; valuable screen time that could've been devoted elsewhere was wasted on this guy.Four- count 'em- four writers.It's not a total wreck, though.  The humor is pretty good and doesn't distract from anything, in fact it works fine- especially when lampshading the whole 'my mask hides my identity' bit, and when Hal's trying to figure out the Lantern's Oath.  The ring's FX are pretty stellar- the comic's versions are fully brought to life. The planet Oa is built upon the organic technology style that's in vogue these days, but just looks dank, dark and dirty.  Parallax is like a greasy, smoky escapee from some Lovecraft fanfic or someone's tentacle hentai fetish- sometimes it looks good, sometimes it don't.  And in typical Remote Control Productions style the music barely registers upon you, a down moment for someone of James Newton Howard's stature.But still- four of 'em?Green Lantern tries to be the type of origins movie that the first Superman film was but fails by not investing enough into the Lanterns themselves.  And you can't help but wonder why it took four guys to write it and still mess it up.",3,"In Brightest Day, In Blackest Night, Four Writers Couldn't Get It Right",1308268800,"06 17, 2011",2011,4432,"['Green', 'Lantern', 'theaters', 'today', 'directed', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'starring', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'title', 'role', 'Blake', 'Lively', 'Carol', 'Ferris', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Hector', 'Hammond', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'Sinestro', 'written', 'Greg', 'Berlanti', 'Michael', 'Green', 'Marc', 'Guggenheim', 'Michael', 'Goldenberg', 'seeing', 'have', 'one', 'burning', 'question', 'really', 'took', 'four', 'people', 'write', 'oughta', 'know', 'plot', 'now', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'test', 'pilot', 'extraordinaire', 'chosen', 'dying', 'legendary', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Abin', 'Sur', 'replace', 'ranks', 'first', 'human', 'ever', 'chosen', 'bearer', 'Abin', 'Sur', 'legacy', 'Hal', 'lot', 'prove', 'new', 'comrades', 'same', 'galactic', 'threat', 'killed', 'predecessor', 'still', 'there', 'giving', 'Hal', 'opportunity', 'earn', 'stripes.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'franchise', 'intact', 'only', 'barely', 'were', 'unfamiliar', 'comic', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'seeing', 'What', 'presented', 'here', 'disjointed', 'choppy', 'kind', 'dull', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'understood', 'need', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'deviate', 'so', 'wildly', 'established', 'material', 'villain', 'Parallax', 'bastardized', 'version', 'two', 'DC', 'characters', 'silly', 'used', 'one', 'borrowed', 'most-', 'Krona-', ""'d"", 'have', 'practically', 'same', 'story', 'origins', 'personalities', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Corps', 'are', 'richest', 'parts', 'story-', 'one', 'best', 'comics-', 'get', 'shorted', 'big', 'time', 'Guardians', 'Universe', 'elder', 'beings', 'creators', 'Lantern', 'Corps', 'are', 'just', 'bunch', 'big-headed', 'blue', 'sourpusses', 'sitting', 'around', 'dark', ""'re"", 'never', 'shown', 'what', 'so', 'special', 'being', 'Lantern', 'why', 'Abin', 'Sur', 'was', 'so', 'revered-', 'Hal', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'gotten', 'ring', 'Cracker', 'Jacks', 'box', 'honor', 'responsibility', 'supposed', 'shoulder.The', 'opening', 'sequence', 'straight', 'rip-off', 'last', 'year', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'intro-', 'whole', 'half-hearted', 'exposition', 'delivered', 'space', 'vistas', 'highlighted', 'mock-ups', 'key', 'figures', 'events', 'Foreshadowing', 'be', 'order', 'day', 'film', 'brother', 'house', 'Hal', 'briefly', 'plays', 'nephew', 'Hot', 'Wheels', 'racing', 'set', 'so', 'guess', 'what', 'debut', 'appearance', 'stop', 'helicopter', 'crash', 'Hal', 'indoctrination', 'Oa', 'Kilowog', 'nowhere', 'something', 'gravity', 'pull', 'sun', 'so', 'big', 'finale', 'Parallax', 'somehow-', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'how-', 'Sinestro', 'Guardians', 'create', 'Yellow', 'Ring', 'based', 'energy', 'Parallax', 'combat', 'even', 'mistrust', 'fear', 'power', '*sigh*Four', 'guys', 'huh', 'Characters', 'are', 'just', 'ok.', 'Hal', 'portrayed', 'mostly', 'boy', 'who', 'never', 'quite', 'grew', 'up-', 'was', 'never', 'portrayed', 'comics', 'so', 'why', 'now', 'Carol', 'Ferris', 'love', 'interest', 'actually', 'more', 'interesting', 'not', 'main', 'character', 'Sinestro', 'given', 'little', 'bit', 'rein', 'show', 'why', 'Guardians', 'go-to', 'guy', ""n't"", 'have', 'nearly', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'not', 'mention', 'how', 'seem', 'have', 'completely', 'screwed', 'up', 'story', 'arc', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', ""'ll"", 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt-', 'now', 'Likewise', 'Kilowog', 'Tomar-Re-', 'two', 'staples', 'franchise', 'are', 'relegated', 'bit', 'players', 'Hector', 'Hammond', 'storyline', 'was', 'completely', 'useless', 'valuable', 'screen', 'time', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'devoted', 'elsewhere', 'was', 'wasted', 'guy.Four-', 'count', ""'em-"", 'four', 'writers.It', 'not', 'total', 'wreck', 'though', 'humor', 'pretty', 'good', ""n't"", 'distract', 'anything', 'fact', 'fine-', 'especially', 'when', 'lampshading', 'whole', 'mask', 'hides', 'identity', 'bit', 'when', 'Hal', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'Lantern', 'Oath', 'ring', 'FX', 'are', 'pretty', 'stellar-', 'comic', 'versions', 'are', 'fully', 'brought', 'life', 'planet', 'Oa', 'built', 'organic', 'technology', 'style', 'vogue', 'days', 'just', 'dank', 'dark', 'dirty', 'Parallax', 'greasy', 'smoky', 'escapee', 'Lovecraft', 'fanfic', 'someone', 'tentacle', 'hentai', 'fetish-', 'sometimes', 'good', 'sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'typical', 'Remote', 'Control', 'Productions', 'style', 'music', 'barely', 'down', 'moment', 'someone', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'stature.But', 'still-', 'four', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'tries', 'be', 'type', 'origins', 'movie', 'first', 'Superman', 'film', 'was', 'fails', 'not', 'investing', 'enough', 'Lanterns', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'took', 'four', 'guys', 'write', 'still', 'mess', 'up']",Green Lantern

The special effects where ok but I do think they are getting cared away with them.

1403484,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B004EPZ07K,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[6, 9]","Finally, after years of sitting on the bench as Marvel Studios churned out adaptation after adaptation for their iconic comic book characters, DC Comics is making an effort to step up to the plate. Sure, DC has had massive success with Batman and to a lesser extent Superman, but their other popular characters have been relatively absent from the silver screen. That is until now.""Green Lantern"" follows a test pilot named Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) as he inadvertently finds himself chosen to become a member of the elite, intergalactic police force known as the Green Lantern Corps. As Hal learns the ropes and begins to understand the scope of his new responsibilities, a mysterious and powerful enemy known as Parallax has set its sights upon Earth. Now, with the aid of his one-time love Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), Hal must find the courage to overcome his fears and insecurities and unleash the power of will before Parallax and his accomplice, Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard), tear our world apart.""In brightest day, in blackest night; no evil shall escape my sight. Let those who worship evil's might, beware my power, Green Lantern's light!"" Those words form the pledge by which every single member of the Green Lantern Corps live their lives. It's not a pledge the characters in this film take lightly, by any means. So, does the film adaptation do justice in bringing this character, all of his supporting cast (both alien and human), and the pledge by which they live and breathe, to cinematic life?If you ask me to answer that question, I would say...yes, for the most part. Are there issues with the film as an adaptation or as just a movie? To an extent, yes there is, but the good and accurate portions (in relation to the comic book) far outweigh the few bits that are incorrect or need work.Written by Greg Berlanti (TV's ""No Ordinary Family"") and Marc Guggenheim (TV's ""FlashForward"") the story for ""Green Lantern"" is a combination of a character-driven drama and an origin tale. Plus, the story boasts a hefty dose of science-fiction, moments of humor, and the rekindling of a romance, not bad for a character's first foray to the big screen.In blending all of those elements together the writers did an impressive job of striking a relative balance between each of them. Thus, leaving audiences with an end result that is a thoroughly entertaining first installment in what will hopefully continue on to become another successful superhero franchise.As I mentioned earlier, more often than not, the film works very well. The scenes set on Oa were both visually stunning and fanboy dreams come to life. I mean come on, anyone that has read a Green Lantern comic has got to admit that it was great to see so many members of the esteemed Corps up on the big screen. The action scenes were also very energetic and well choreographed and the intermixing of live-action with CGI was relatively seamless (at least 95% of the time).As for the drama unfolding within the story, most of it was gleamed from Geoff Johns' superior retelling of Green Lantern's origin during a comic book story arc known as Secret Origin. The movie does an admirable job of conveying the inner turmoil that had consumed Hal for much of his life. Plus, the scenes shared between Hal and Carol were very nice moments that offered a quiet respite from the more sci-fi oriented aspects of the story.Now, I will admit that there were parts of the film that didn't work as well as they should have. Chief among these issues is the handling of the film's primary villain, Parallax.For the most part, I didn't mind the film's take on Parallax, because in the comics he's never really been given an origin tale. So, the fact that the writers, with the blessing of Geoff Johns (who served as a consultant on the film), combined the Parallax character with a fallen Guardian, although not canon, it did make sense to me.Of course, some may cry foul at that departure from the comics, but for me it wasn't much of an issue. The bigger problem with the character was in his appearance.Never has Parallax appeared in the comics as a cloud-like entity (&agrave; la Galactus from ""Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer""). While at various points within the film the character's face does somewhat resemble his comic book counterpart, more often than not, it looked nothing like him. However, since the goal was apparently to make the character a villain of more substance rather than merely a spirit entity, this departure while not my favorite choice, didn't ruin the movie, but it did bring it down a little bit.Some other very minor gripes surround a few of the CGI sequences that appeared more rushed in order to get the film completed on time. And in some instances some of the scenes of Hal on Earth interacting with Carol or various other characters would occasionally feel oddly edited. As if there were bits of information either omitted from earlier in the scene or from elsewhere in the film.Now, a major issue that some critics are citing with this film is that many of the actors and actresses in this movie are woefully miscast. If you ask me, this couldn't be further from the truth.First off, Ryan Reynolds (""The Proposal"") as Hal Jordan turned out to be a spot-on choice for the role. I'll admit that at first I was skeptical of Ryan's casting. Reason being was aside from having the proper physical appearance his typically sarcastic demeanor didn't seem to fit the character. However, aside from a few brief moments early on in the film, Ryan's trademark sarcasm was kept in check.I think that in casting Ryan Reynolds DC and Warner Bros. made a wise decision by going with a lead actor that has star power, is young enough to build a franchise around, and has the acting chops to help the audience relate to the character and accept the more outlandish aspects of the material. Personally, I think that Ryan was a great choice in the end, and despite my misgivings early on, he ultimately wound up impressing me in the role.Alongside Ryan as Carol Ferris, a love interest for Hal, is actress Blake Lively (""The Town""). Blake is yet another casting choice that many took issue with by saying that she never convincingly conveys the authority her character possesses and that she lacks any true acting ability.Again, I disagree as I felt that Blake was very good as Carol. She brought strength and determination to the role. And, any perceived limitations with her character are due to the fact that her role wasn't as fleshed out as Hal's, but that's where a sequel can come in to play.Serving as one of the film's villains (the one that is flesh and blood) is actor Peter Sarsgaard (""Flightplan"") as Hector Hammond. In the comics Hector has always been very creepy and stalker-ish towards women, and as odd as this is to say, Peter really nailed this aspect of the character perfectly.As Hector, Peter played the part in two distinct ways. The first was as a very meek and subservient individual, who was always too weak to speak out or defend himself or his ideas. Then after his chance encounter with Parallax he embraces his newfound power and lords it over everyone he can. All the while he is trying to woo Carol Ferris, albeit in the creepiest manner possible.Now, a big gripe by many a critic, and even some comic book fans, is that the various alien members of the Green Lantern Corps show up as little more than over-glorified cameos. Honestly, this to me made sense given that this film was about Hal Jordan's journey to become a Green Lantern, and not the collective Corps at large. However, Warner Bros.' marketing department (whether instructed to or not) showcased the various other members of the Corps to such a degree that most expected to see a lot more of them in the movie.However, what's done is done, and despite their cameo status, the various alien members of the Corps that were featured were all terrific adaptations of their comic book counterparts. Whether they were completely computer generated (for example Tomar-Re and Kilowog) or an actor with heavy amounts of make-up and prosthetics applied (Sinestro), each were convincing, living breathing versions of some of the more renowned members of the Corps come to life.Comprising the main three members we are introduced to in the film are three very talented actors. First is Mark Strong (""Robin Hood"") as Sinestro, one of the leading and most revered members of the Corps. Mark perfectly conveyed Sinestro's contempt for new recruits into the Corps. Plus, showcasing his indomitable inner strength and determination to be the best there is at what he does is Sinestro through and through.Along with Mark Strong, are actors Geoffrey Rush (""The King's Speech"") and Michael Clarke Duncan (""The Green Mile"") providing the voices for Tomar-Re and Kilowog respectively. Both Geoffrey and Michael were spot-on in their vocal renditions of the characters, especially Michael whose booming bass voice perfectly complimented Kilowog's impressive stature.Well, I suppose I've gone on about this movie long enough, and so I leave you with one last thought: despite what most of the critics have said about the film, ""Green Lantern"" is truly an entertaining piece of summer superhero movie fun and is easy to follow and understand even if you're not familiar with the character.Not to mention, those aforementioned critics, most of them admit they've never read the comic book on which this film is based. Which is obvious given that much of their complaining is in regards to aspects of the film that are completely accurate to the source material. So, in that respect, I wouldn't put too much stock in their opinions of this movie.""Green Lantern"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",4,"Beware His Power, Green Lantern's

1403501,ARAWVCUZQ6X4Q,B004EPZ07K,King Me,"[4, 6]","Was sort of itching to write a quick review (of the movie only at this point). First off, this film took way, way more abuse than it deserved when in theaters! Judging by most of the reviews I read, I thought my eyeballs were going to burn out of my skull if I dared to view it! Anyway, I did think the writers and director made some unfortunate choices in what story to tell and in how to portray the character of Hal Jordan, and I think that those mistakes hurt the film to a large extent, but by no means made it into a terrible movie.To be a little more specific, they made Hal Jordan to be a much sadder, less confident person than he should have been for a big-budget, summer film that they were hoping would become a solid franchise. Hal was portrayed as too much of a screw-up who, after being given this absolutely incredible gift and responsibility of the power ring, quickly gives up and goes home after being roughed up a little in training. Crazy! That should have been the moment when he said to himself, ""Finally! I have a way to do something fantastic with my life!"" He should have been more of a shot-in-the-arm for the Green Lantern Corps, not someone who comes across as something of a quitter. That being said, I thought Ryan Reynolds was perfectly cast as Hal and certainly did what was asked of him in the film. Its just that I feel the writers/director made some bad choices for him.I understand that they approached it as though Hal felt he failed to live up to his father because Hal felt fear and he believed his father did not, but that seemed a sort of flimsy reason to cripple him with self-doubt for most of the movie. It seemed that Hector Hammond was in the film to show another variation on how a father can effect his son's mental health and confidence, but to tell you the truth, I didn't enjoy being distracted by another emotionally damaged character when I wanted to see an excited Hal Jordan on an incredible first adventure with the Corps. Plus the mutated Hammond sort of turned my stomach a little too much. Gross! And again, the actor portraying him did an excellent job, its just that the way he was written distracted from what was cool and exciting.And I thought Blake Lively took way too much abuse as well. She was perfectly cast, looks very much like Carol Farris, was smokin' hot and her acting was perfectly fine. What was the problem? And she'd have made a great Star Sapphire, too.I really enjoyed the end fight with Parallax. I thought the FX looked great and they did a fine job of showing how cool it is to wield one of the rings. I thought it was great seeing Green Lantern streak off into space with that gigantic beasty chasing him. Just the scale of it was exciting. And though it might have been a little goofy, I loved the way they had Hal use a giant fist to punch Parallax into the sun. You gotta smile at something like that!I should mention the helicopter action scene quickly. It just seemed a little silly to me how long it took that damn thing to come down! I mean it seemed to be spinning around out of control for ten minutes while people ran in circles screaming, and then another five minutes rolling around in Hal's hot wheels track before it crashed! Just GRAB the frikkin' thing already! hah. But anyway, even THAT scene didn't bother me all that much. It was just goofy.So to wrap this short review up: Green Lantern was a quite flawed but very fun movie, full of excellent characters and a huge, NEW universe to explore. I REALLY hope they don't give up on a sequel, its really such a great story with limitless potential. And one last thing, the casting of Mark Strong, his portrayal of Sinestro and the look of the character were all perfection. We GOTS to see him again!(October 28 Update) Just an add-on regarding the blu-ray of Green Lantern. The good news is that I think it looks and sounds GREAT! I can't agree with the criticisms of the picture quality. Also, I thought the CGI suits for the Lanterns worked perfectly and were a good idea. The bad news is that this movie must have some kind of curse on it! Somehow they decided that there would be no Bookmark option on the disc! Of all the many blu-rays I own, THIS is the one that most needs viewer-chosen bookmarks to allow you to skip over the parts that just don't work, and get right to the parts that are actually pretty cool. Also, they chose to use some murky black and white printing on the discs themselves. They look terrible. Finally, I do have to agree that the ultraviolet/flixster digital copy is a pain. Maybe they're ahead of their time on that (since there are some interesting options online, and if I could actually access it from my tv rather than my computer, it might be useable), but the iTunes digital copies (included on disc, NOT downloaded) are much better. I'll be steering clear of the ultraviolet copies in future. I'd still LOVE to see a sequel to Green Lantern, though. Great characters and potential.",4,Great characters!

1403503,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B004EPZ07K,K. Ostrowski,"[3, 3]","I've read some other reviews of this film, but after having seen it myself, I have to say, I only half agree with what they had to say.I've heard the claim that the lantern ring creates matter from nothing; a power that only God possesses.  No, it doesn't.  They make it quite clear in the film that the ring creates constructs out of energy, not nothing.The movie claims that ""will"" is ""the greatest force in the universe.""  Not only do I believe this to be false, but the comics, to my knowledge, didn't make this claim.  They insisted that the Lantern Ring was ""the most powerful weapon in the universe,"" but all that stuff about the green power being greater than anything else is clearly incorrect.  I can think of several characters in DC Comics who could make it tap-dance with a snap of their fingers.Issue has been taken with the philandering behavior of the main character at the start of the film, and I'm very glad to hear that I'm not the only one who saw the problem with this.  The movie tries to imply that fearlessness is the only important thing about being a Green Lantern.  That's false.  You also need to be utterly honest, and of course, guess which of those qualifications the main character lacks in this film?Hal Jordan himself (the title character) is easily the most irritating thing about the movie.  For some reason, they decided to make him not only energetic, wisecracking and extroverted (traits the character had in the comics as well,) but also dishonest, self-centered, childish and rock stupid (traits he did -not- have in the comics.)  Because of this, Hal, and every relationship scene containing him, got on my nerves severely.The villain, sure enough, is a growing, planet-consuming lovecraftian abomination named Parallax, which mutates one Earthman into a psychic elephant-man-looking character who apparently runs on fear, and consumes several others like the blob before he's eventually defeated.  I didn't find anything terribly interesting or fun about this villain, and the ""innocent people body count"" he gets doesn't help matters any.I do have to admit that the scenes on Oa were pretty good, and the film's rendition of the Green Lantern Corps and the Guardians was very good.  I also liked the visual effects used for the power ring, and wished we could have seen more of that, and less of Hal trying to get back together with his former girlfriend Carol.On the whole, I wasn't pleased with this movie, although it did have some moments I found visually-impressive, which gave me a nice thrill in exchange for my time.  If I were to rate it, with movies like Superman, Spider-man 2 and The Avengers at the top of the scale, and movies like Daredevil, The Fantastic Four and Catwoman at the bottom, Green Lantern would be right in the center.  It's the closest thing to a ""meh"" superhero movie I've ever seen.Final Notes: There's one last thing I forgot to mention; Amanda Waller.  This annoyed me severely.  The actress who they got to play Amanda Waller is a good 200 pounds too light to play her.  What really makes this bad, though, is that there's another woman in the film who would have been perfect for her, if only she hadn't been busy playing ""woman in distress"" during the Parallax attack on the city.",3,"I like the crazy, alien parts best, but meh overall",1345075200,"08 16, 2012",2012,3262,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'film', 'having', 'seen', 'have', 'say', 'only', 'half', 'agree', 'what', 'had', 'say.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'claim', 'lantern', 'ring', 'creates', 'matter', 'nothing', 'power', 'only', 'God', 'No', ""n't"", 'make', 'quite', 'clear', 'film', 'ring', 'energy', 'not', 'nothing.The', 'movie', 'claims', 'will', 'greatest', 'force', 'universe', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'believe', 'be', 'false', 'comics', 'knowledge', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'claim', 'insisted', 'Lantern', 'Ring', 'was', 'most', 'powerful', 'weapon', 'universe', 'stuff', 'green', 'power', 'being', 'greater', 'anything', 'else', 'clearly', 'incorrect', 'can', 'think', 'several', 'characters', 'DC', 'Comics', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'tap-dance', 'snap', 'fingers.Issue', 'been', 'taken', 'philandering', 'behavior', 'main', 'character', 'start', 'film', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'hear', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'saw', 'problem', 'movie', 'imply', 'fearlessness', 'only', 'important', 'thing', 'being', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'false', 'also', 'need', 'be', 'utterly', 'honest', 'course', 'guess', 'qualifications', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'title', 'character', 'easily', 'most', 'irritating', 'thing', 'movie', 'reason', 'decided', 'make', 'not', 'only', 'energetic', 'wisecracking', 'extroverted', 'character', 'had', 'comics', 'well', 'also', 'dishonest', 'self-centered', 'childish', 'rock', 'stupid', 'did', '-not-', 'have', 'comics', 'Hal', 'relationship', 'scene', 'containing', 'got', 'nerves', 'severely.The', 'villain', 'sure', 'enough', 'growing', 'planet-consuming', 'lovecraftian', 'abomination', 'named', 'Parallax', 'one', 'Earthman', 'psychic', 'elephant-man-looking', 'character', 'who', 'apparently', 'fear', 'consumes', 'several', 'others', 'blob', 'eventually', 'defeated', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'terribly', 'interesting', 'fun', 'villain', 'innocent', 'people', 'body', 'count', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'any.I', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'scenes', 'Oa', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'rendition', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Corps', 'Guardians', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'also', 'liked', 'visual', 'effects', 'used', 'power', 'ring', 'wished', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'less', 'Hal', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'Carol.On', 'whole', 'was', ""n't"", 'pleased', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'moments', 'found', 'visually-impressive', 'gave', 'nice', 'thrill', 'exchange', 'time', 'were', 'rate', 'movies', 'Superman', 'Spider-man', '2', 'Avengers', 'top', 'scale', 'movies', 'Daredevil', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'Catwoman', 'bottom', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'center', 'closest', 'thing', 'meh', 'superhero', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Final', 'Notes', 'one', 'last', 'thing', 'forgot', 'mention', 'Amanda', 'Waller', 'annoyed', 'severely', 'actress', 'who', 'got', 'play', 'Amanda', 'Waller', 'good', '200', 'pounds', 'too', 'light', 'play', 'What', 'really', 'bad', 'woman', 'film', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'only', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'busy', 'playing', 'woman', 'distress', 'Parallax', 'attack', 'city']",Green Lantern

Despite the excitement I felt during the film's development, it gets a bargain bin rating now that I've finally seen it.Not a terrible film, but not something to pick up at full price either. It might be a fair value when it drops to ten bucks and under. Apart from contemporary effects, this is the Green Lantern movie that we could have expected in the late eighties or early nineties alongside the Keaton Batman films and the John Wesley Shipp Flash TV series. Reynold's Green Lantern would have been right at home in those superhero worlds, not least of all for the scream-queening of Peter Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond and the goofy nature of some of Hal Jordan's ring constructs.The film has more than a few flaws, but for me the greatest disappointment was the lack of integration between the events on Earth and those in space. This should have been a story of awe and wonder on an incredible scale, yet each time my imagination began to soar I found it yanked back down to a clumsy, two-dimensional Earth.There were also some playback issues--even following an update--with this Blu-Ray disc that I haven't been able to troubleshoot yet.

Personally I was just stoked that the Green Lantern character would ever get a big budget movie so that for me was enough to watch it. I understand not every person is familiar with the character or grew up reading the comics so its hard to like the movie unless you are already somewhat of a fan.Most people will agree that they did get some things right on for example, Mark Strong as Sinestro (Hell Yeah!) and yes Ryan Reynolds was a capitol choice for Hal Jordan. Other than those two pluses, I do think the movie crossed too many story lines for a first movie. Only dedicated fan boys can keep up with all of the mishmash that was going on.They crossed at least 3 major story lines all in the first film and that to me was complete overkill. The Sinestro Corp War storyline was hinted at, The Parallax storyline was raped and abused into this film and the Hal Jordan origin story was rushed along in this film as well.I totally think that Hugo Strange did not even need to be in this film. The Movie should've just focused on Hal Jordan, his origins and early days as the Green Lantern of Earth. The other story lines could be spread across a really nice trilogy that could've ended with the Parallax Saga.

Just judging it as a movie, it didn't measure up to the best superhero movies that have come out over the last few years - Spiderman and Ironman being my favorites, as well as The Dark Knight. These brought something different to the genre because of the complexity of the characters, their tortured depths, and how they were played by their respective actors. Unfortunately, although the writers tried to give some of that complexity to Green Lantern, it just didn't come through well. So many scenes are cliche, and neither Ryan Reynolds or Blake Lively manage to bring much emotional depth through. And their chemistry was not great either.The story, in terms of the alien race that is the source of Green Lantern's power, and the 'guardian' role they play is interesting, as is the idea of 'will' and 'fear' as forces in the universe that they can harness. However, the training scenes seemed like a combination of Star Wars and Karate Kid, but weren't done as well as either. The special effects were good - I especially enjoyed the guardian flying sequences - but not enough to entirely save the film for me.So overall, mildly entertaining, but a bit cliche and wooden - not the stuff of a new hit series of movies, I think.",3,"Had Some Fun Special Effects, But Lots of Cliche Moments, and Performances Just So-So",1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,1352,"['should', 'first', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'original', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'story', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'perspective', 'Just', 'judging', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'best', 'superhero', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Spiderman', 'Ironman', 'being', 'favorites', 'as', 'well', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'brought', 'something', 'different', 'genre', 'complexity', 'characters', 'tortured', 'depths', 'how', 'were', 'played', 'respective', 'actors', 'Unfortunately', 'writers', 'tried', 'give', 'complexity', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'well', 'So', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'cliche', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Blake', 'Lively', 'manage', 'bring', 'much', 'emotional', 'depth', 'chemistry', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'either.The', 'story', 'terms', 'alien', 'race', 'source', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'power', ""'guardian"", 'role', 'play', 'interesting', 'idea', ""'will"", ""'fear"", 'forces', 'universe', 'can', 'harness', 'However', 'training', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'combination', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'were', ""n't"", 'done', 'as', 'well', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'guardian', 'flying', 'sequences', 'not', 'enough', 'entirely', 'save', 'film', 'me.So', 'overall', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'bit', 'cliche', 'wooden', 'not', 'stuff', 'new', 'hit', 'series', 'movies', 'think']",Green Lantern

1403518,A3TRXPRUYVOLSM,B004EPZ07K,Little Roy Blue,"[4, 10]","I avoided seeing ""Green Lantern"" when it hit the theaters, because the trailers looked bad and most reviews were harsh. But as the months went by, I became oddly curious to see this much-maligned film. Could it possibly be as bad as I'd heard...?The answer to that question is, of course, yes - it really is *that* bad. So if, like me, you dodged this turkey initially but have a strange itch to see it now, I can confirm that this itch need not be scratched.The film has so many problems that it's hard to know where to begin trashing it. First of all, despite the massive budget, it looks awful. The computer effects have an unconvincing, video-game feel to them, while the aliens are universally corny. Overall, the film has a hideous aesthetic sense - unless you happen to be fond of lime green, canary yellow, and fuchsia. The action scenes, meanwhile, have the hectic and totally unexciting quality of most contemporary action scenes. (How I long for the days when Hollywood knew how to properly thrill audiences with stunts, extras, and physical effects...)Needless to say, the script is awful as well. The writers never give us any reason to like Hal Jordan, who is depicted as a self-involved creep (and played with zero depth by Ryan Reynolds). Another problem is that the relationship between Hal and Carol Ferris is poorly developed, as is their mutual connection to Hector Hammond. These three characters form the emotional core of the movie, yet their collective backstory is very sketchy indeed.Also, I don't think the movie does a good job of ""selling"" the concept of Green Lantern. Alas, the idea of a superhero who creates green energy shapes out of pure willpower strikes me as a little too strange even by Hollywood standards. Plus, it raises all kinds of questions for me; if Green Lantern can really create *anything* with his ring, why does he settle for bland stuff like giant fists and (yawn) guns? And finally, all the chatter this movie serves up about the conflict between ""willpower"" and ""fear"" strikes me as abstract and silly. (Compare the baloney you get here to Batman Begins, which used the concept of ""fear"" in very intelligent ways to develop both the plot and the characters.)In short, this thing stinks. Indeed, it's a textbook example of everything that's wrong with contemporary cinema. Compared to Green Lantern, the Thor movie is a masterpiece - while a real masterpiece like Amadeus exists in another universe entirely. So, I strongly advise you to avoid Green Lantern, just as you would avoid a poisonous yellow cloud of...erm...tangible fear, or something like that.",1,"Deserved all the bad reviews, and even a few more--!",1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,2611,"['avoided', 'seeing', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'when', 'hit', 'theaters', 'trailers', 'looked', 'bad', 'most', 'reviews', 'were', 'harsh', 'months', 'went', 'became', 'oddly', 'curious', 'see', 'much-maligned', 'film', 'Could', 'possibly', 'be', 'as', 'bad', ""'d"", 'heard', 'answer', 'question', 'course', 'yes', 'really', '*that*', 'bad', 'So', 'dodged', 'turkey', 'initially', 'have', 'strange', 'itch', 'see', 'now', 'can', 'confirm', 'itch', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'scratched.The', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'problems', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'trashing', 'First', 'all', 'massive', 'budget', 'awful', 'computer', 'effects', 'have', 'unconvincing', 'video-game', 'feel', 'aliens', 'are', 'universally', 'corny', 'Overall', 'film', 'hideous', 'aesthetic', 'sense', 'happen', 'be', 'fond', 'lime', 'green', 'canary', 'yellow', 'fuchsia', 'action', 'scenes', 'meanwhile', 'have', 'hectic', 'totally', 'unexciting', 'quality', 'most', 'contemporary', 'action', 'scenes', 'How', 'long', 'days', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'knew', 'how', 'properly', 'thrill', 'audiences', 'stunts', 'extras', 'physical', 'effects', 'Needless', 'say', 'script', 'awful', 'as', 'well', 'writers', 'never', 'give', 'reason', 'like', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'who', 'depicted', 'self-involved', 'creep', 'played', 'zero', 'depth', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'problem', 'relationship', 'Hal', 'Carol', 'Ferris', 'poorly', 'developed', 'mutual', 'connection', 'Hector', 'Hammond', 'three', 'characters', 'form', 'emotional', 'core', 'movie', 'collective', 'backstory', 'very', 'sketchy', 'indeed.Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'selling', 'concept', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Alas', 'idea', 'superhero', 'who', 'green', 'energy', 'shapes', 'pure', 'willpower', 'strikes', 'little', 'too', 'strange', 'even', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'kinds', 'questions', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'can', 'really', 'create', '*anything*', 'ring', 'why', 'settle', 'bland', 'stuff', 'giant', 'fists', 'yawn', 'guns', 'finally', 'chatter', 'movie', 'up', 'conflict', 'willpower', 'fear', 'strikes', 'abstract', 'silly', 'Compare', 'baloney', 'get', 'here', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'used', 'concept', 'fear', 'very', 'intelligent', 'ways', 'develop', 'plot', 'characters', 'short', 'thing', 'Indeed', 'textbook', 'example', 'everything', 'wrong', 'contemporary', 'cinema', 'Compared', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Thor', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'real', 'masterpiece', 'Amadeus', 'universe', 'entirely', 'So', 'strongly', 'advise', 'avoid', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'just', 'would', 'avoid', 'poisonous', 'yellow', 'cloud', 'erm', 'tangible', 'fear', 'something']",Green Lantern

1403527,A1R17YELPTSM5T,B004EPZ07K,MacJunegrand,"[1, 1]","(This review is about both the Theatrical and Extended Cut versions)Ah, the Green Lantern movie.  It's somehow ironic that a movie that contains the theme of rooting for the underdog ended up being the underdog that got constantly bullied by critics.  As I do sometimes in my reviews, first, a little history.THE COMIC:Green Lantern, the character (and universe) that gets adapted in this movie, is a DC comics franchise that was originally the reboot of a previous franchise by the same name but with different elements (the original Green Lantern was alone and not a member of a group, had nothing to do with space, wore a different suit and had a different weakness).  Later the original character was brought back to share the universe with the new one.  If you think it's confusing to have two characters sharing the same name, try 3600.  Then double that.  Plus 1.You see, Green Lantern is not just the story of one character, but of a vast universe of them.  Hal Jordan, pilot, who works at Ferris Aircraft with his girlfriend Carol Ferris (yup, the owner's daughter), is suddenly and unexpectedly summoned to the crash site of a spaceship by a dying alien, Abin Sur, who bestows him with a ring, which has chosen Hal as his successor.  Abin Sur is a member of the Green Lantern Corps, an intergalactic peacekeeping force armed with power rings that have the ability to create any physical object its wearer can think of, and it's powered by will.  Every construct created by the ring is made of green, hard energy, and its strenght is either magnified or diminished by the user's willpower or lack thereof.  The rings also grant the ability to fly and since they're advanced technology, they can translate other languages and provide its user with information.  The rings' energy has to be recharged periodically by a lantern that's given to each member of the Corps.  Hence the name, Green Lantern.The GL Corps are managed by their creators, the Guardians of the Universe, an ancient race of aliens who harnessed the power of will in a giant battery located on the planet Oa, the center of the known universe.  Then they divided the universe in 3600 sectors and asigned a guardian to each one, powered by a ring.  The guardians don't choose the recruits, the rings do.  Unfortunately, the rings have a weakness.  Due to an impurity in the central battery, caused by an entity named Parallax, a being of pure fear that was imprisoned in the battery by the Guardians, who couldn't destroy him, the rings can't directly affect anything of color yellow, since it's the color of fear.  That means, if the Green Lanterns want to attack something/someone of color yellow, they need to attack him indirectly.  For instance, they could create a giant fan that makes wind to blow the object away, or use the ring's energy to lift a boulder and throw it at the guy in the banana suit.  The Green Lantern ring is the most powerful weapon in the universe, but just like any weapon, it's only as good as its user.Hal Jordan's first real challenge is to overcome being the replacement of Abin Sur (even though he didn't chose to be), who was a loved member of the Corps, specially before Sinestro, Abin's friend and one of the top GL members.  Then, he later proves himself to the group by defeating a powerful enemy and is finally welcomed to the Corps as one of their own.THE MOVIE:As you probably expect by knowing the story, this is a pretty hard concept to get in a movie.  It's less a regular superhero tale and more of a space opera, like Star Wars.  The entire concept is really, really different from most stories out there, and it's quite a lot to take, so, when word got out that they were going to make a Green Lantern movie, fans were both excited and worried for the film.  Why?  Because making a film faithful to the comic it would mean a lot of people would consider it too bizarre, so the filmmakers had a hard choice to make.  If they focused on making a good adaptation, they'd be subjected to bad reviews from people who thought the thing was too crazy.  If they focused on making a good film, they'd leave the fans angry.  Unfortunately, they didn't focus on either and instead they tried to go the easy way by going with a tried-and-true tale, thinking that would give them leeway to make a good adaptation without the need to focus too much on story.  It... didn't work very well.The movie is, in general, a pretty good adaptation of the basics of the story.  We have Hal Jordan being brought to Abin Sur's crash site and being given the ring and lantern, we have him being taken to Oa to be trained and we have him proving himself to the Corps by defeating a seemingly invincible enemy on his own.  We have two classic GL villains in this film, Parallax, and Hector Hammond, a biologist who gets infected by Parallax and becomes deformed but gets granted telekinetic abilities.  So yeah, the basics are there but... the details and execution leave a lot to be desired.This movie got a lot of hate from critics, most of them calling it bad.  But, if you take your time to read a few reviews, you'll notice that critics really want to hate the film, but are unsure why.  The criticisms are different in every review, and some praise what others criticize.  In general, when a movie is actually bad, it's easy to pinpoint why (most critics agree on what they didn't like on, say, The Phantom Menace, for instance).  The problem with Green Lantern is not that it's bad, it's that it's GENERIC.  Sometimes to the point of being infuriating.  And, as you know, average is usually much worse than bad when it comes to entertainment.For instance, instead of actually focusing the story in space and making this an original superhero tale, the story is mostly relegated to Earth, making it like pretty much every other superhero movie.  Instead of focusing on what makes Hal Jordan an interesting character in the comics, they go for the old ""I am in doubt about me, and I don't think I can do this job"" trope.  Instead of making Hector Hammond the central villain (who could have been a fantastic sympathetic villain), the film focuses on Parallax, who has been transformed into an strictly one-note villain in this story.  Instead of making the protagonist a sympathetic character, they make him a jerk (note this: unlike for every other comic book power fantasy, here the nerd is the villain and the jock is the hero).  The Guardians of the Universe are kind of jerks in the comics, and the GL's opinions many times clash with them.  Here, the GL's blindly follow their commands no matter how ridiculous.  And the film ignores the color yellow weakness.Plus, there are some problems with the film's visuals.  The effects are pretty good for the most part.  GL's suit is made of pure energy, so it makes sense for it to be made with CGI instead of clothes.  But the problem is the central villain.  For a villain who's supposed to be the personification of fear, he's really not scary.  At all.  He looks like the giant octopus from that awful Titanic animated movie that pretends no one died (yes, that movie exists, and it even has a sequel with that stupid octopus as protagonist).  I understand what they were going for, but it just wasn't a good idea.  For instance, the SFX makers claim they made Parallax look like a smoke cloud because having him spread around the buildings would bring people memories of 9/11 and the buildings crashing, which was scary...  Am I the only one who thinks that's a really stupid reason?  I mean, smoke is not scary by itself.  Sure, 9/11 was terrible, but we're talking about the physical representation of fear here.  It should be something primal, something elemental, not something that MIGHT remind some people of a particular situation that happened years ago and very few people witnessed personally.Also, and this is something that might sound strange, but the score... is not good.  I mean, it's not just that you won't find yourself humming the GL theme (you probably won't, though), but the music just doesn't fit the action on the screen.  Sometimes it's so terribly distracting that you will find your inmersion completely broken.  Which is strange, because the composer is not bad.  I don't know what happened here.So yeah, the film has problems, but... is it really bad?  No, of course not.  Generic is not bad.  Plus, the important thing about the movie is that, well, it's fun.  A lot of fun.  Yeah, sometimes there are some misses and groan-inducing moments, specially when it comes to really tired cliches, but when the movie hits, it's always bullseye.  The action scenes are exciting, every moment that happens outside the Earth is a treat, the comedy bits are really funny, and, I can't stress this enough, the actors do a great job with their parts.  You can feel Carol's frustration at Hal's inmaturity.  You can feel Hector's self-loathing and disdain for his father.  You can see Hal's real feelings behind the ones he shows, and the movie does a good job of showcasing the constructs he creates under pressure.  So yeah, while I wouldn't call it a great film, it's definitely an entertaining one, if you give it a chance.THE EXTENDED CUT:This cut is not much longer than the theatrical one, it only adds less than ten minutes of scenes, and a few of them are repeated in flashbacks later in the film (the theatrical version only shows the flashbacks), but some of them are quite important, and I fail to see why weren't they shown in theaters.  We get mostly more scenes with Hal as a child, and some more time with his nephew, which adds to the characterization of both (even though later scenes with the nephew were removed from both cuts).But the most important scene shows Hal, Carol and Hector together as children with their parents.  It already establishes their personalities and shows they were friends as kids, which is an important pillar in which the rest of the movie should stand.  It's easier to understand Hector's grudge and Hal's life once you see it, yet for some reason it got removed.  Go figure.  In any case, the extended cut is the way to go.  It's not much longer, but it's clearly the superior version.THE EXTRAS:Unlike the regular version, the Extended Cut comes with a few extras.  There's a very interesting video that talks about Green Lantern's history in the comics which should be watched by anyone who's not familiar with the character before watching the film.  There's a short one that shows the filming process and how Ryan Reynolds became Green Lantern, which is interesting as it shows how passionate the team and actors were about the project and the characters, but it's curious, since a lot of the things they rightfully praise did not make the transition into film, so I don't know who's to blame for this movie's problems.There's also an interactive feature-length extra which shows information alongside the film while its being played.  A lot of interesting things are said and shown here, and it, again, shows the passion the cast and team had.  There are also a bunch of deleted and extended scenes.  Some are interesting, some not.  Some you can easily see why they were cut, and some I'm puzzled as to why they did it.  The last extra is a digital comic: the first issue of the New 52 JLA comic (for those not-in-the-know, this is the first issue of the reboot of the Justice League comic that occurred a couple of years ago).  The art is great (Jim Lee is one of the best comic book artists), but I've read the story arc in its entirety, and I'm absolutely not a fan.  They kinda really, really screwed up the characters.  That being said, the first issue is the least damaging, and it has some funny dialogue, so I see no reason not to check it out.All in all, a good film held back by some poor decisions, but pretty entertaining nonetheless.  The Blu Ray picture has fantastic visual and audio quality, so go for it.",4,"Not the movie GL deserves, but pretty good nonetheless",1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,11947,"['review', 'Theatrical',

I don't know, but when you've got an eight-year-old boy, you've got to watch some comic book superhero movies. Maybe this will help you decide whether you want to take your kid yourself or have some other adult take your kid and give them a nice glass of wine or a cold beer when they bring your kid home--or decide whether it's suitable for your child at all.Just to give you an idea of my taste, not because I love to talk about myself but so you'll know whether it's worth your time to keep reading what I have to say, I don't read superhero comics and I usually don't like movies made out of superhero comics. I did, however, enjoy Tim Burton's first ""Batman"" and Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight."" Maybe I just have a soft spot for ""Batman"" having grown up on the high-camp Adam West/Burt Ward TV show. Given a choice between a superhero comic movie and a romantic comedy, I'll take the superhero comic movie unless the rom-com has Cary Grant, George Clooney or Owen Wilson or is directed by Woody Allen or the Coen Brothers. I had never read a ""Green Lantern"" comic and knew nothing about the character except that the original DC Comics artist supposedly based the character's look on Paul Newman.So, ""The Green Lantern."" Ryan Reynolds stars as playboy test pilot Hal Jordan who is haunted by having, as a child of perhaps 10, watched his father die in a fiery test pilot crash before his eyes. This is shown in a graphic flashback that some kids may find disturbing. Ryan does not look like Paul Newman but he does look pretty good in his green superhero suit and has a certain charm about him. Blake Lively plays his love interest, Carol Ferris. Superhero girlfriend parts are hard to play, but she seems extra-dull. Peter Sarsgaard steals every scene he's in as a nerdy scientist who is infected by fear (more on that below) and becomes the embodiment of evil on earth. I hadn't heard of the rest of the actors except Tim Robbins who plays a corrupt politician. Other than the charming Reynolds and the morbidly fascinating Sarsgaard, most of the actors' performances are of the conventional, ham-fisted comic-book type.Forgive me if I don't get the all details exactly right, but ""The Green Lantern"" involves a threat of destruction of the universe. Guardians are a circle of elders who are in charge of 3600 peacekeepers of the universe called Green Lanterns. The Green Lanterns keep the peace by the power of ""will."" The universe is under threat of destruction from a fallen Guardian called Parallax whose power is ""fear.""  Green Lanterns are mortal and when one dies, his special Green Lantern ring chooses a successor who must be fearless.  A dying Green Lantern crashes his spaceship and his ring chooses our hero Hal Jordan as his successor and the first-ever human Green Lantern. Will Hal live up to the honor and responsibility bestowed upon him by the ring and save the universe by destroying Parallax?We find out through a great many very intense, very loud battle sequences and a few quieter scenes where Carol tells Hal he needs to live up to his responsibilities. The visual imagination on display in the Green Lantern is impressive. The special effects are well done. The pacing is quick enough. However, this is a very violent and frightening movie. My kid found some of the material too intense and at one point said he wanted to go home. (I always make him wait it out because I figure if he sees the resolution, that will cause fewer nightmares than if he walks out when he's most frightened.) Even I was feeling some anxiety at points,  and after the thousands of movies I've watched, I'm pretty immune. As we walked out of the theater, my son said he thought ""The Green Lantern"" was ""really cool."" I kind of wish I had not taken him though.There were no surprises, a lot of cliches, and an obvious set-up for a sequel, but overall I enjoyed the ""The Green Lantern"" more than I thought I would.",3,"Striking Visuals, Trite Plot",1308787200,"06 23, 2011",2011,4002,"['Should', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'genre', 'review', 'movies', 'genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', ""'ve"", 'got', 'eight-year-old', 'boy', ""'ve"", 'got', 'watch', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'movies', 'Maybe', 'will', 'help', 'decide', 'want', 'take', 'kid', 'have', 'other', 'adult', 'take', 'kid', 'give', 'nice', 'glass', 'wine', 'cold', 'beer', 'when', 'bring', 'kid', 'home', 'decide', 'suitable', 'child', 'all.Just', 'give', 'idea', 'taste', 'not', 'love', 'talk', 'so', ""'ll"", 'know', 'time', 'keep', 'reading', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'superhero', 'comics', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movies', 'made', 'superhero', 'comics', 'did', 'however', 'enjoy', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'first', 'Batman', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Maybe', 'just', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'Batman', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'high-camp', 'Adam', 'West/Burt', 'Ward', 'TV', 'show', 'Given', 'choice', 'superhero', 'comic', 'movie', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""'ll"", 'take', 'superhero', 'comic', 'movie', 'rom-com', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'directed', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'comic', 'knew', 'nothing', 'character', 'original', 'DC', 'Comics', 'artist', 'supposedly', 'based', 'character', 'look', 'Paul', 'Newman.So', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'playboy', 'test', 'pilot', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'who', 'haunted', 'having', 'child', 'perhaps', '10', 'watched', 'father', 'die', 'fiery', 'test', 'pilot', 'crash', 'eyes', 'shown', 'graphic', 'flashback', 'kids', 'may', 'find', 'disturbing', 'Ryan', 'not', 'look', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', 'green', 'superhero', 'suit', 'certain', 'charm', 'Blake', 'Lively', 'love', 'interest', 'Carol', 'Ferris', 'Superhero', 'girlfriend', 'parts', 'are', 'hard', 'play', 'extra-dull', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'scene', 'nerdy', 'scientist', 'who', 'infected', 'fear', 'more', 'below', 'embodiment', 'evil', 'earth', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'rest', 'actors', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'who', 'corrupt', 'politician', 'Other', 'charming', 'Reynolds', 'morbidly', 'fascinating', 'Sarsgaard', 'most', 'actors', 'performances', 'are', 'conventional', 'ham-fisted', 'comic-book', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'details', 'exactly', 'right', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'threat', 'destruction', 'universe', 'Guardians', 'are', 'circle', 'elders', 'who', 'are', 'charge', '3600', 'peacekeepers', 'universe', 'called', 'Green', 'Lanterns', 'Green', 'Lanterns', 'keep', 'peace', 'power', 'will', 'universe', 'threat', 'destruction', 'fallen', 'Guardian', 'called', 'Parallax', 'power', 'fear', 'Green', 'Lanterns', 'are', 'mortal', 'when', 'one', 'special', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'ring', 'successor', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'fearless', 'dying', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'spaceship', 'ring', 'hero', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'successor', 'first-ever', 'human', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Will', 'Hal', 'live', 'up', 'honor', 'responsibility', 'bestowed', 'ring', 'save', 'universe', 'destroying', 'Parallax', 'find', 'out', 'great', 'many', 'very', 'intense', 'very', 'loud', 'battle', 'sequences', 'few', 'quieter', 'scenes', 'where', 'Carol', 'Hal', 'live', 'up', 'responsibilities', 'visual', 'imagination', 'display', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'impressive', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'pacing', 'quick', 'enough', 'However', 'very', 'violent', 'frightening', 'movie', 'kid', 'found', 'material', 'too', 'intense', 'one', 'point', 'said', 'wanted', 'go', 'home', 'always', 'make', 'wait', 'out', 'figure', 'resolution', 'will', 'cause', 'fewer', 'nightmares', 'out', 'when', 'most', 'frightened', 'Even', 'was', 'feeling', 'anxiety', 'points', 'thousands', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'watched', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'immune', 'walked', 'theater', 'son', 'said', 'thought', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'was', 'really', 'cool', 'kind', 'wish', 'had', 'not', 'taken', 'were', 'surprises', 'lot', 'cliches', 'obvious', 'set-up', 'sequel', 'overall', 'enjoyed', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'more', 'thought', 'would']",Green Lantern

There are almost no redeeming qualities, and it is a painful, if sometimes unintentionally comical viewing experience. The dialogue is abysmal, the visual effects subpar, the performances weak, and the story limp.Green Lantern is a superhero I didn't know too much about going in. The opening of the film tries to compact an entire series' worth of comic book lore into a three-minute jumble of exposition. Basically, it's explained that there are a a couple thousand protectors of the universe called the Green Lantern Corps. They wear green rings that are powered by green lanterns, which give the wearer the power to create anything that they can imagine (sword, machine gun, giant fist, etc.). The Lanterns are kind of like Jedi, using the Force (green energy) as a weapon against the Dark Side (the yellow lanterns of fear). The Lanterns are ruled by a council of elder aliens who sit atop large pillars. Whether they sit there constantly or just during meetings is unclear.Ryan Reynolds plays Hal Jordan, the cocky pilot who has been ""chosen"" by the ring to be the next Green Lantern. The whole story operates under an inherently silly premise, and one which clearly is more easily visualized in comic book form, so I can sympathize to an extent with the hurdle the filmmakers had to cross to try and make it seem legitimate. However, they approached it the wrong way, relying too heavily on Ryan Reynolds' jokey persona to poke fun at how asinine everything around him is. ""I pledge allegiance to a lantern, that was given to me by a dying purple alien"", he stutters. And later, ""I always knew I'd be a green supercop, defending the universe"".Ryan Reynolds may have the body type for the Green Lantern, but he was probably not the perfect casting choice for this movie, or even a decent casting choice. Reynolds is one of those guys you tend to like in spit of yourself; yes, he seems like an egotistical douche, but in the right set of circumstances, he can be charming. Needless to say, this movie does not have the right set of circumstances. He's even more of an ass than usual in this film, awkwardly infusing humor at every possible moment, and cheesing up the melodrama in the more dramatic scenes.The main villain of ""Green Lantern"" is a giant space blob that feeds on fear, called Parallax. It's a shapeless blob that has a disembodied head floating amongst the goop. I would talk about what a lame, uninteresting villian it is, but I'm too distracted by the fact that it's a direct rip-off of Hexxus, the villain from FernGully: The Last Rainforest.

1403548,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B004EPZ07K,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[225, 276]","Green Lantern has received quite a bit of flak from reviewers for not being mainstream enough to relate to modern audiences. And that's a shame, because if Green Lantern is guilty of anything, it's of being a SUPERHERO movie.Back before all these directors started streamlining films, revising backstories, and taking out Spider-Man's technologically-advanced web shooters, comic books were a glorious hodge-podge of the near possible, the impossible, and the just plain fantastic. Because superhero settings include every superhero and villain imaginable, they have to accommodate magic, aliens, superscience, and alternate dimensions in one heady mix. This makes for a very rich comic book series that can be intimidating for new audiences - which is precisely why movie directors cut out so much.But you can't cut all the crazy out of Green Lantern and still stay true to the comics. And so, with tons of exposition, Green Lantern rabbit-punches viewers with world-shattering fact after mind-altering fact in the first five minutes: aliens exist, there's a giant yellow monster imprisoned in a planet, ancient humanoids predating humanity have been guarding the universe with green willpower, and there's a dizzying variety of highly advanced technical races from across the galaxy. Green Lantern makes Superman's backstory look quaint. His name doesn't help either - Emerald Flashlight has to say an oath that activates a ring that's charged by a lantern that's powered by a planet that's actually the embodiment of all sentient beings' will. No wonder critics got confused.)o()o()o( ""I pledge allegiance to a lantern, given to me by a dying purple alien."" - Hal Jordan )o()o()o(Director Martin Campbell knows all this. He makes fun of the ridiculous circumstances in which Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds and his fab abs) finds himself, ranging from a dogfight with two robot jets to a dogfight with a giant soul-eating monster. Part of what makes Green Lantern so entertaining is that it embraces its pulpy roots: there's the childhood sweetheart (smoking hot Blake Lively as Carol Ferris who just happens to be a successful businesswoman and fighter pilot), the nebbishly awkward villain (Peter Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond), and tough-as-nails ""red Spock"" Sinestro (Mark Strong). The real villain of the piece, Parallax, sounds like a 1980s video game effect - oh wait, it is! This is not a movie to be taken too seriously.)o()o()o( ""It's not a magic ring--it's a ring powered by advanced technology!"" - Hal Jordan )o()o()o(And yet, Green Lantern is no movie trifle. The challenge with a superhero who has powers like Green Lantern is that the possibilities are literally endless - the rings are powered by the hero's will, which means he can technically imagine anything. This also means that an abusive hero might imagine black holes and solve all of his problems that way. Green Lantern cleverly constrains these god-like powers by imposing plot-related restrictions on Hal's creativity. When all Hal can come up with to stop a helicopter from crashing into partying guests is a Matchbox car in a ramp, it's because he played with one in his nephew's room the day before. When he's trying to use the sun's gravitational pull as a weapon, it's because he used the Earth's gravitational pull as a weapon against the two jets earlier and because his tutor Kilowog points out that gravity is a...uh, harsh mistress. Hal Jordan might always manifest boring weapons straight out of a first-person shooter, but that's because he's harboring a lot of guilt over his military daddy's death.)o()o()o( ""You thought I wouldn't recognize you just because I can't see your cheekbones?"" - Carol Ferris )o()o()o(Speaking of daddy issues, Green Lantern is one giant ball of forest-colored father/son conflict: Hal and his military pilot father, Hammond and his successful senator father, dead Abin Sur and grieving Sinestro, Abin Sur and the newly created Green Lantern, Parallax and his newly adopted avatar Hammond...it's clear the Green Lantern writers were looking for some emotional hook, and that hook was spelled out D-A-D. Green Lantern tries very hard to be deep.Unfortunately, Green Lantern can be pretty shallow at times. Parallax, remember, is an ancient being predating much of humanity's evolution, but he falls for the oldest trick in the book. We're supposed to believe that Parallax really, really, REALLY hates Abin Sur and everything associated with him. After he kills Abin Sur, you have to ask why Parallax wants to go after just Hal Jordan when he could be eating so many other Green Lanterns for breakfast.When Green Lantern goes big, it's glorious, but when it pulls in tight, the plot turns an earth-shattering battle between god-like beings into a schoolyard shoving match. But really, that's pretty normal from superhero comics. It's just that today's movie superhero fans expect a guy in a cloak that's just like you and me without any of the world-spanning baggage.Green Lantern's guilty of being true to Green Lantern, spandex, mask, ring and all. For those who find it implausible, maybe a superhero powered by a jade-colored light source isn't for them.",3,Daddy Issues,1309478400,"07 1, 2011",2011,5172,"['Green', 'Lantern', 'received', 'quite',

1403551,A2ZFN595FLTHEB,B004EPZ07K,Michael Martinez,"[5, 13]","For those of you wanting a review from a Green Lantern fan, here I go:The film was okay. But just okay. After seeing it, you have to wonder when you're handling an intellectual property revolving around creativity and imagination, why wasn't more of that injected into the project? Was the director just not up to properly conveying just how large-scale this movie could be? Should have they have just threw a bunch of money at Geoff Johns to write the movie instead of getting a bunch of guys together to see if they could imitate what he's done to make Green Lantern so popular over the last several years? Did they not have to budget to do what they should have, which was to break from the superhero staple of a love interest and set this movie almost entirely in space as Hal learns to sling the green?I'm sure the answers to these questions are known to some already or will come out following the film's release, but for whatever reason, I find it hard to imagine a GL fan would say this movie lives up to its potential. Here are some of the reasons why the film missed the mark:*Blake Lively was positively wooden save for maybe one scene.*Hal's time exploring the capabilities of the ring and training on Oa was too brief.*There's no memorable musical score to go along with the character.*The CGI of organic creatures was off and felt sub-standard, as if whichever company behind it didn't really take pride in their work.*The relationship between Hal and Sinestro isn't explored enough, and overall Sinestro wasn't given enough screentime, certainly not enough to demonstrate his motivations for doing what he does in the stinger.*The action was a bit too brief and the big bad is defeated too easily.*There were no stand-outs acting-wise.*There's no real personal beef between the main villain and Hal, so there's little emotional weight to their fight.It's certainly disappointing if you're a GL fan and if you realize how much better it could have been if they'd gone a different way with it or gotten the money and creative team to take pride in the movie rather than simply throw a DC superhero movie out there just to show they're making an effort (albeit minimal) in the comic book big screen battle.I wish I could give it a 2.5/5-Star review because this movie was so middle-of-the-road, but the more I think about this movie, the more I realize how disappointing the experience was, when it should be the other way around, so I'm going to have to round down on this one.",2,Unimaginative and Underwhelming,1310428800,"07 12, 2011",2011,2490,"['wanting', 'review', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'fan', 'here', 'go', 'film', 'was', 'okay', 'just', 'okay', 'seeing', 'have', 'wonder', 'when', ""'re"", 'handling', 'intellectual', 'property', 'revolving', 'creativity', 'imagination', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'injected', 'project', 'Was', 'director', 'just', 'not', 'up', 'properly', 'conveying', 'just', 'how', 'large-scale', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'Should', 'have', 'have', 'just', 'threw', 'bunch', 'money', 'Geoff', 'Johns', 'write', 'movie', 'instead', 'getting', 'bunch', 'guys', 'together', 'see', 'could', 'imitate', 'what', 'done', 'make', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'so', 'popular', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'Did', 'not', 'have', 'budget', 'do', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'was', 'break', 'superhero', 'staple', 'love', 'interest', 'set', 'movie', 'almost', 'entirely', 'space', 'Hal', 'sling', 'green', ""'m"", 'sure', 'answers', 'questions', 'are', 'known', 'already', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'following', 'film', 'release', 'reason', 'find', 'hard', 'imagine', 'GL', 'fan', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'up', 'potential', 'Here', 'are', 'reasons', 'why', 'film', 'missed', 'mark', '*Blake', 'Lively', 'was', 'positively', 'wooden', 'save', 'maybe', 'one', 'scene', '*Hal', 'time', 'exploring', 'capabilities', 'ring', 'training', 'Oa', 'was', 'too', 'brief', 'memorable', 'musical', 'score', 'go', 'along', 'character', '*The', 'CGI', 'organic', 'creatures', 'was', 'off', 'felt', 'sub-standard', 'whichever', 'company', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'take', 'pride', 'work', '*The', 'relationship', 'Hal', 'Sinestro', ""n't"", 'explored', 'enough', 'overall', 'Sinestro', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'screentime', 'certainly', 'not', 'enough', 'demonstrate', 'motivations', 'doing', 'what', 'stinger', '*The', 'action', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'brief', 'big', 'bad', 'defeated', 'too', 'easily', 'were', 'stand-outs', 'acting-wise', 'real', 'personal', 'beef', 'main', 'villain', 'Hal', 'little', 'emotional', 'weight', 'fight.It', 'certainly', 'disappointing', ""'re"", 'GL', 'fan', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'been', ""'d"", 'gone', 'different', 'way', 'gotten', 'money', 'creative', 'team', 'take', 'pride', 'movie', 'rather', 'simply', 'throw', 'DC', 'superhero', 'movie', 'there', 'just', 'show', ""'re"", 'making', 'effort', 'minimal', 'comic', 'book', 'big', 'screen', 'wish', 'could', 'give', '2.5/5-Star', 'review', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'middle-of-the-road', 'more', 'think', 'movie', 'more', 'realize', 'how', 'disappointing', 'experience', 'was', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'other', 'way', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'round', 'down', 'one']",Green Lantern

It is definitely one of the weaker comic book hero films, but that's not to say there was not any fun to be had. The ability to create anything using the ring had a few neat moments, though it did need more ring action, and the universe traveling with all the different kinds of alien species was different for this type of movie.Ryan Reynolds is okay here as the hero in green. He really didn't seem to be trying that hard to turn in a memorable performance, but maybe that's due to the limitations of the rather weak script. Blake Lively sure looked good, but unfortunately that's about all the praise she is going to get from me. Peter Sarsgaard was decent in yet another underwritten part as the villain with the BIG head that looked flat out silly. What was Tim Robbins doing here other than collecting a check?Like I said, the story was only semi-interesting because of the alien element.

1403563,A20OMCGB73X5LV,B004EPZ07K,Moon Donkey,"[4, 5]","The plot is basically as follows - this nasty entity named Parallax (sounds like a drug for arthritis or erectile disfunction) is floating around the universe destroying worlds, eating souls, etc.  You know, the usual evil space entity kind of stuff.  Kind of reminds me of a floating skull Galactus or something.  The Green Lanterns, as protectors of the universe and what have you, must stop the evil Parallax.  Got that?  Ok.The caveat to all this is that Parallax was previously defeated and imprisoned by a Green Lantern named Abin Sur.  Parallax was apparently the greatest enemy that the Lanterns had faced.  It was quite an accomplishment by Abin Sur to defeat him.  The problems start when Parallax escapes.Are you ready to have your world shattered by a revelation of why this film is so stupid?  Ok... her it goes.If a Green Lantern named Abin Sur defeated Parallax and saved the universe, why is it that apparently the Green Lanterns know absolutely nothing about it?  Huh?  Sinestro, the leader of the Lanterns HAS NO IDEA what or who Parallax is.  None of the Lanterns have any idea at all.  Huh?  Parallax was the greatest threat they faced... Parallax had been defeated by Abin sur (who is still around btw).  So why the heck doesn't anyone know anything about Parallax?  Does this make any sense at all?  Any?  Of course not... it is completely and utterly stupid.Having said that, allow me dear friends to ask a simple question - why did the writers choose to have the Lanterns not know about Parallax?  Why?  Or put it this way... wouldn't it been better if they had known about Parallax from the beginning?  If that was the case, the plot would have gone something like - *Oh no!  It is Parallax!  He has escaped!  Green Lantern's to battle!  We must defeat him once again!*  You know, something along those lines.But no.  Since the Lanterns inexplicably know nothing about him, the plot goes something like *Parallax who?  Parallax what?  Gee... I guess we should send out some Lanterns to take care of this thing... and then get our butts kicked by it... and then find out after the fact that the Council knew about it and let us go anyway... etc...etc.*Get my point?  Not only is the plot stupid because it makes no sense.  It is stupid because the plot would have been better if the Lanterns had known in the first place.Having said that, the film then doubles down on the stupidity.Parallax is running around making a mess of things, so Sinestro approaches the Green Lantern Council (a group of little blue people called Guardians or something) about what to do.  Sinestro mentions that Abin Sur referred to the threat as ""Parallax"" before he was lost.  Then Sinestro begs the council to allow him to lead a team of his best Lanterns against the threat.  The council agrees - after which the group of Lanterns get their butts kicked.Here is the problem - we later find out that even though the Lanterns didn't know about Parallax, the Council knew who Parallax was - Parallax used to be one of them.  He was seduced by the yellow power of fear and became Parallax (sort of like Darth Vader was seduced I guess).  Even though the Lanterns have never heard of Parallax, the Council is well aware of him.  Ok ... but then why doesn't the council mention any of this to Sinestro?  Huh?  They allow Sinestro to lead a team of Lanterns to their doom knowing full well that Parallax is too powerful.  What?  Cat got their tongue or something?  If I was Sinestro, I'd be mighty upset when I got back.  ""What - didn't anyone think that this information was important to tell me before sending us out to get slaughtered?""On another subject - I thought that the explanation of green power (will) and yellow power (fear) was stupid.  Hal Jordan, the ""new"" green lantern is told that the Lanterns harness the green power of will because it is the most powerful force in the universe.  Uhhh... ok.  Then how do you explain Parallax?  This is one guy who tampered with the yellow power and became a universal menace.  One guy.  One guy exposed to yellow that is apparently more powerful than all the green ones put together.  And green is more powerful how?Also, when the Lanterns have to come up with a plan to defeat Parallax, what do they do?  They forge a yellow ring.  I suppose they must figure that all the green ones aren't good enough.  So I repeat - the green power is more ""powerful"" how?Speaking of the green power and of rings, does it make any sense that Sinestro questions Hal Jordan's selection as a Lantern?  Why wouldn't Sinestro give him the benefit of the doubt?  After all, we are told that the green power is the most powerful power in the universe.  We are also told that the rings seek out those who are deserving of the power.  Well, Abin Sur's ring found Abin Sur at one point, and Abin Sur was great, so why wouldn't the ring do the same thing again?  Did Sinestro think the ring went haywire or something?  Did he think the ring was broken?  Why the heck did he think the ring selected Hal Jordan?  Huh?  Did Sinestro think he was smarter than the ring?Again, this makes no sense at all.  The correct reaction would have been for Sinestro to recognize that Hal Jordan must have the potential because the ring selected him.  Look... either you have faith in the green power or you don't.  If you do, you trust the ring.  If you don't, then what the heck are you doing leading the Lanterns?  So what does Sinestro do?  He mocks Hal Jordan, tells him he is worthless, and that the ring made a mistake.  It makes no sense.Well - all is good in the end.  Lucky for Hal Jordan and the rest of the Lanterns that Parallax, though very powerful, is apparently the dumbest skull shaped space cloud in the universe.  How dumb is he you ask?  Parallax is so dumb that he ends up killing himself by flying into the sun.  Sure, he is chasing Jordan toward the sun.... but what?  Didn't he see the sun or something?  Didn't the cloud think to himself... ""Hmmmm... I'm getting kind of close to the sun... maybe this isn't a good idea...""  Parallax is a giant space cloud, so I figure the guy must have some experience flying around planets and suns and such.  Therefore, I find it a bit odd that Parallax thought this would be a good day to chase a Lantern so close to the sun that he couldn't escape.Look - I don't have high standards for these films, but I can't fathom how this stuff gets past the directors, producers, writers, editors, etc.  Wasn't there a single person on the set asking himself or herself why none of the Green Lanterns had ever heard of Parallax?  Wasn't there a single voice in the crowd that said it didn't make sense?",1,Surprise (not really)... another film that makes no sense.,1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,6667,"['plot', 'basically', 'nasty',

1403574,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B004EPZ07K,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[0, 1]","The long awaited adaptation of my beloved Green Lantern has had its share of critical flack since it was first released, which is not to say that it isn't all deserved.  While Green Lantern is quite a flawed superhero film, it isn't nearly as bad as so many have said it is.  A miscast Ryan Reynolds stars as Hal Jordan, a test pilot who is chosen to join the intergalactic police force known as the Green Lantern Corps.  In the process the evil alien entity of fear known as Parallax (voiced by Clancy Brown) is headed towards Earth, while Hal takes on his newly mutated former childhood acquaitance Hector Hammond (Peter Saarsgard) and tries to woo his occasional girlfriend Carol Ferris (Blake Lively).  That principal cast for the most part does little if anything to enhance what's going on storywise, with the Green Lantern mythos itself getting equal parts faithful re-telling and hastily-revised editing.  What is the most interesting about the film are the all too-briefly seen alien Lanterns like Sinestro (Mark Strong), Kilowog (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan), and Tomar (voiced by Geoffrey Rush) and the Lantern home planet of Oa, all of which are wonderous sights to behold.  The Lantern construct effects are wonderful, but none of this makes up for the ultimately empty proceedings.  Still, all things considered, this could have been much worse.

Especially a ring that can reproduce any man made object on the planet?This film wasn't as action packed as the review on the back cover indicates. However, it was entertaining. If you can suspend your belief in reality for 114 minutes, you might enjoy this film.The way Lantern's origin was presented had a lot of holes in it's logic. In the original origin of Green Lantern (the 60's version); he gets his powers from an alien who has crash landed. In the modern movie version a ball of green light swoops up Hal Jordan out of nowhere, with no explanation, to the crash site.It's a confusing story. The Green Lantern Corps aspect of the story was too much for the uninitiated.  While it presented some exciting looking visuals, it was a too disjointed for me. The alien threat to planet earth unfolded a too predictably.  Watching Tim Robbins (as the Senator) and Angela Basset  the scientist) just made me cringe. They deserved a lot better than the secondary roles in this film. The dialogue they had to speak was very clich&eacute; ridden material fans have heard in hundreds of movies.  If you can ignore the silliness of the script, it's still a fun little movie.The climax of the film makes it worth your wait.  The monster was a shapeless mass that I've never seen before; unless he's part of the new comics.  The creature looks like a giant.....well, you'll come to that conclusion when you see it.  When you see the end, you'll be just as confused as I am. The DVD should have came with a guide to the leaders in the Green Lantern Corps.  If you follow the comics, you won't have to wonder who all the players are.If you bother with DVD extras; The Cartoon Network has a preview of The Green Lantern CGI cartoon series.  Had the producers gone with a cartoon instead, it might have been more successful.  The snippets in the preview show much better characters and scenes than the live action movie.

And a geek who wants Green Lantern's girl friend so he turns himself into a hideous monster in order to kill her or get GL's power ring or destroy the earth?

And that flying exhibition to establish Hal Jordan as an irresponsible but gifted pilot who has bad memories of his father's death is so ripped off from Top Gun.  The producers of that film deserve a really big check along with an apology.  The best scenes are on the planet Oa and the best character is Sinestro -- two great reasons for a sequel that will never be.  Ryan Reynolds is to Green Lantern as a duck is to a Volvo.

A deadly dull prologue starting the film on the wrong foot, miscasting an adorable, boyish 1/2-comedian more in touch with his muscle shirts than his own soul, shallowing out every character until we can only guess what turns Hector Hammond's frustrations homicidal (or even why he gets picked to examine the dead alien), or why Hal Jordan's ""humanity"" is a quality no other Green Lantern has but is enough to destroy the alien threat, or how the Guardians governed the universe for billions of years but seem befuddled, confused and abashed when Hal Jordan tells them they can win if they face fear, a locker-room pep talk speech they find ""compelling""...There is no unified aesthetic here to coordinate the humble Earthly settings and the outlandish, circus-like wonders from outer space so they seem to occur in the same universe and don't clash jarringly.  Had they the imagination, they could have found the answer in the human technology on display but employed here only to service the story.  How is it we humans can live in cluttered homes, utter banal dialogue of puerile cliche's, drive recklessly and arrive late for work, waste our best talents in unrewarding teaching posts, yet produce flying machines of wondrous power and complexity?  It didn't appear out of nowhere, and everyone seems to take it for granted.  Because the WORK that went into it is left out here, with no hint of a test pilot's demanding education and technical intelligence.  People once laughed at the idea of human beings flying, but stopped laughing the first time they saw an aircraft leave the ground.  A Grail knight in armor of the Crusades, or Gandhi or Jesus in their robes -- even Batman in his spandex -- are far out of our normal visual experience, but are solemn symbols of great power and moral courage AND STUDY to millions of people.  Not that we must be entirely solemn here, but still.)THAT said...the film grabs hold with the test dogfight, parallels Jordan's humility at his selection with Hammond's own, follows Sinestro's demands to harness the yellow power of fear against Parallax with the Ferris contract-award dance party entirely lit with YELLOW light -- in fact, with the sound off, the whole film becomes a symphony with light, beautifully, I mean BEAUTIFULLY, photographed by Dion Beebe, lots of early-morning and late-afternoon golden warmth filtering through the airplane factory office windows, sculpting the leads in their gentle romantic scene on the control tower, fretting the cool glow of the planet Oa with shadows slanting from pillars and steles and cliffs, lighting up Hammond's dreams of personal consequence at the government lab where he examines Abin Sur....The film also squirrels away little comments throughout, like the large peace sign on the wall behind Jordan's nephew (Jordan tests warplanes, but they, and the Lanterns, are about peacekeeping); the plastic female anatomy-lesson torso in the classroom belonging to the lonely, female-repellent dweeb loser Hammond, with the skin off, showing all the stuff inside he cannot, symbolically, ever reach; the caged hamster in Hammond's home, running madly in its stationary wheel or lying still, way in the background.  And for once, the nonstop epidemic of thunderous, echoing digital slamming noises that pollutes every CGI movie and every film trailer even when no CGI is in the story, has a use, announcing the power of the ring when it flashes, the way lightning heats air so fast a thunderclap results.Kudos to the producers for shooting in the refreshing and atypical (for Hollywood) Louisiana settings.  And especially to Mark Strong and Temuera Morrison as Sinestro and Abin Sur, who take their roles seriously enough, despite wearing alien makeup and glowing leotards, that you can't take your eyes off them, and relish their dialogue readings.Let's hope the filmmakers (and especially the writers) know what to do with the sequel.

I'm wondering what got cut out of it because in some places it's hard to follow, like as if something is missing.  It was hard to understand the motivation for the villan, Hector Hammond, and how the monster with the big head fit into the plot. Carol Ferris and some of the other characters were more cardboard-like, but the actor who played Green Lantern did a great job of bringing him to life and of fleshing out Hal Jordan as well.  The other thing about it that I was a little disappointed with is how they had a sequence where Green Lantern saves a crowd from a falling helicopter and then meets Carol  on the balcony of her apartment.  It was so much like Superman:The Movie, and I think the plot could have been more original in that regard.

The storyline was okay enough, and the acting by all was done well, but I thought the action scenes and special effects were great, and the 3D was truly awesome. Ryan Reynolds did a really good job as the hero, Hal Jordan, and Peter Sarsgaard as the antagonist Hector Hammond was really good too, and Mark Strong as the Green Lantern Corps leader, Sinestro was excellent. I hope they make a sequel so that I can see more of Sinestro and what he plans to do with the power of the yellow ring of fear. This movie overall was pretty cool and a lot of fun to watch.So since I recently obtained a 3D TV and 3D Blu Ray player this year, I've been getting more and more into 3D movies for home viewing and I decided to buy the Green Lantern 3D Blu Ray, which also came with a regular Blu Ray version of the movie, and a DVD version of the film as well, and I placed an order with Amazon because this movie seems to be kinda hard to find in the stores around my area. And I have to say that I am very happy with my purchase.

The CGI in this was actually outstanding IMHO, except for using primary colors in CGI it's like trying to keep a white car clean, it just accentuates the problems.The Story and Action were far better than expected but the insecurities and play boy nature of Hal did stray from the character a bit, that was one of the problems of going with a character like Hal since he was so dull, would have been better off telling Kyle or John Stuart's back-story.

This question came to my mind pretty often as I sat through this movie, waiting with a yawn (a few dozens of those in fact) for it to end.What can any idea, no matter how good, look like, if it is beaten to death? DEAD, of course, what else.This movie keeps it no secret that the basic tenet it is trying to preach is what many of us have read and seen in Rhonda Byrne's ""Secret"".There should NOT have been any problem with the idea had the goings on been more interesting.Two factors screw the secret:One, the special effects do not justify the setting. The dispute is of inter-galactic nature, which should have been shown as a battle of epic proportion BUT the producers were too scared to invest big money to create such a strife on screen. I bet they too were devoured by the Guardian of Fear, Parallax. (Parallax by the way is a black amoebic being, which feeds on fear of civilisations spread across 1000s of ""sectors"" in our universe and harbours the diabolical desire to annhilate the Universal Peacekeeping corps known as the GREEN LANTERNS). Nothing wrong with thinking of a BIG CANVAS idea provided one has a BIG CANVAS available. The director and the makers of this movie were seriously hard pressed for funds.Two, I too would have been devoured by the Guardian of Fear, Parallax had I been betting a BIG CANVAS project on a facetious looking leading man. Ryan Reynolds looks like a super hero who was flipping burgers at Mc Donald's before he was ""chosen"" by the ""RING"" to be part of the corps. The ring, I bet was either affected by the ever growing pollution, when it entered our atmosphere or it was made in China that it chose Ryan Reynolds to assume the role of a peace-keeper, somoene who presumably needed to have the star presence to look convincing fighting off and vanquishing an inter-galactic enemy. A ""ring"" in its right mind would have chosen an actor who does not look and act like ""garibon ka John Travolta"".Word of advice for the producers - Change the leading man, go to a big investor (call Anil Ambani) and you may have a better sequel to offer.Final Verdict - Watch only if your sleeping pills are losing effect.Rating - yawn/5(P.S: Ryan resembles Hrithik Roshan in some scenes.

Hal is a test pilot, cocky and reckless. And the Corps doesn't believe that Hal or humanity is worthy to join their ranks. But humanity may have what the Corps has been missing in their fight against Parallax - willpower.Hal Jordan (played by Ryan Reynolds) is brazen, courageous, and witty. When the Green Lantern ring chooses him, with no instructions, humor ensues. As with other super hero origin stories, Hal takes a while to learn and train his newly found power. Seeing early clips and images, I was worried that the Green Lantern aliens would be too corny and ridiculous-looking for comic-to-film adaptation. And while there still was a bit of hokey-ness at times, I was really impressed on how the aliens were handled and at the amazing CGI.It does help to go in to movies with lower expectations. I actually thoroughly enjoyed every bit of the story and the characters. The main villain Hector, Parallax's puppet, (played by Peter Sarsgaard) is a tortured, almost sympathetic character. And Mark Strong as Sinestro is simply fantastic. As science fiction and comic book fan, I was swept away in the action and amazing special effects, as the hero travels to and from space.

This review is for the Theatrical Release.]Green Lantern -- Not as bad as the Critics ThinkFirst Impressions:What I liked about Green Lantern was the simple plot and explanation.  I have heard that some felt they would not get the film if they were new to the character or never heard of Green Lantern.  Nothing could be further from the truth.Plots & Holes:The film starts out with what I thought was a clear understanding of what the Green Lantern Corps was all about.  The origin story with Hal Jordan as the Green Lantern was altered from comic book canon but that's fine.  It is only a comic book, right?The Parallax character was changed a bit as well from the comics.  Here the bad guy is an irresistible force, a former Guardian who looks amazingly like Galactus did from the Fantastic Four movie!  He lives on fear!Now, characters living off emotions and draining them to achieve power, like a spirit vampire, is not new to fiction.  I mean Star Trek had that as one show.  What's different here is that the beast tends to draw out what looks like the skeleton of the person.  The animation on this is fierce.Carol Ferris, played by Blake Lively, was miscast.  She tried to come off tough but was not really as forceful as the comic book character.  When she finds out about Hal the scene was funny and pokes fun at the whole secret identity thing.  In the comics, no one recognized Green Lantern as Hal Jordan as long as he wore the mask.Family:My only real criticism is that the family of characters was not fully developed.  The film touches on Hal's family, his brothers and his nephew.  They seem mad at him for being reckless or forgetting birthdays.  Why so mad?  What's the back-story if any?  Who is this nephew and why do we care?Green Lantern Corps:The whole Guardians thing and the planet Oa I felt were faithful to the comic book characters but even more so.  The Guardians are blue aliens, immortals and an ancient race who put all this together in the first place.  As in the comics they are pretty stuck up and arrogant.The Corps does not accept Hal at first and this is quite a blow to his self esteem as he has self doubts.  This part of the story was hard to swallow as well.  I could not see a jet pilot being so full of self doubt after earlier in the film showing such bravado and recklessness.Hammond:Hammond is a secondary villain who gains power through accidentally coming in contact with the Parallax element.  This is a far cry from the comics but is forgivable.  The back story again is missing.  He seems jealous of Hal with Carol.  Why?  What's their history?Credits:There is a cool thing with Sinestro mid credits.  Don't miss it.  It did make me excited for a sequel.Bottom Line:Not the best they could have done and often missed opportunities to shine.  However, this is a great summer movie to take the kids to.  And fans, don't worry if the first film does not work out.  Neither did Superman's first film.  Nor did Batman hit the screen first time running.  And the first Star Trek film was really, really long!Ryan Reynolds was good as the reckless Hal who grows a conscience.  Blake Lively was very good-looking but could not quite pull Carol Ferris off.

It is not utterly horrible, but for those of us looking forward to a truly good or even great Green Lantern film, that is nowhere to be found here. I would say that this one is good to have around for kids to watch, but be warned, the villain in this film is one of the most terrifying in any mainstream comic book-based movie that I have seen,As far as specifics - and bearing in mind that this is only my opinion - Ryan Reynolds is unable to play a convincingly serious Hal Jordan. He is simply miscast in this role. But he is not helped by the script and direction of this film, which tries to be a little too lighthearted for its own good. The rest of the cast is fairly decent (Mark Strong as Sinestro is fantastic), but their parts are in most cases not written very well, which feeds back into the screenplay as a whole. It should have been a lot better than this.Finally, the visual effect are in many places appallingly cheap-looking for such an expensive, high-concept film. The power ring constructs look good (aside from often being goofy in form), but the scenes on Oa are horribly low-budget-looking. Perhaps too much time was spent rendering the CGI costumes?

1403664,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B004EPZ07K,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[1, 2]","This movie has taken a lot of flak on many different levels. At the same time there are some people who really liked it. I'm not one of them. In the wave of comic book movies that have been flowing through the theaters Green Lantern comes out as a weak and halfhearted endeavor. The pacing is lopsided. The script is weak. Acting is uninspired. Eye candy is about the only thing the movie seems to try to be consistent on, and even there it falls short of the movies it's competing with.There are two big problems with this movie. The first is how the story unfolds. It starts off strong with a good set up for our hero Hal Jordan with character strengths and flaws all rolled up in a tidy bow before he finds a dying alien, who then passes the role of interstellar guardian with powers limited only by your imagination to him. From there the story stays flat. Branching side plots start interesting, then cartoonish. Hal's training story is forgettable. The build up to a planet destroying evil didn't feel like a build up. Worst of all the that was tossed at the beginning of the movie showing some promise for character development was dropped over and over again with some pretty trite script writing keeping our hero on the bench for way too long.Too much focus seems to be on the pretty CG effects, which isn't pretty enough to replace good storytelling. What happens is the action doesn't raise the level of excitement as it seems to rely too much on the special effects. The scenes that are supposed to be dramatic are overdramatic; almost to the point of pulp style. There is no buildup when there should be and there is no plot development that isn't being outplayed by the computer effects and melodrama. But hey, it's a superhero movie. This is about seeing a beloved comic character come to life more than high drama. Well they screw that up too.Green Lantern is a pretty violent film for a freshman introduction to a 40's superhero to the public. Of course other superhero films show violence, but it's all about presentation. A guy gets burned alive. Innocent bystanders are vaporized. And the way this stuff is presented is pretty dark and seems to revel in showing it (another notch against the movie's heavy handed CG fetish). It just seems to be way too much grit too soon for a franchise about a green colored force for good.Acting is mostly uninspiring with a few exceptions. Mark Strong's Sinestro is so spot on I wished the movie would have been about him. Peter Sarsgaard does a good Hector Hammond as well. Clancy Brown gets a shout out for lending his voice to the only good part of the ridiculous Parallax. Special effects are just about on par for a superhero movie, but that's not a good thing when the special effects are the star of the show.You get the theatrical release of the film along with an extended cut with nine minutes of extra footage. Nothing that really makes a difference in this film unfortunately. The movie's package of extras is not bad and is all on high definition. Here's the breakdown:Maximum Movie Mode: Green Lantern's Light - It's essentially a picture in picture with a ton of interviews, featurettes, pop up trivia, bios and more.Focus Points - All of the featurettes from Maximum Movie Mode. &#34;The Art of Green Lantern,&#34; &#34;Weapons Hot: The U.C.A.V. Dog Fight,&#34; &#34;Reinventing the Superhero Costume,&#34; &#34;Ring Slinging 101,&#34; &#34;We Are the Corps,&#34; &#34;Acting Under 10 Pounds of Silicone,&#34; &#34;Guardians Revealed&#34; and &#34;When Parallax Attacks.&#34;The Universe According to Green Lantern - Interviews with comic writers, fans, film crew and executives all talking about the history of the comic and characters.Ryan Reynolds Becomes the Green Lantern -  A pretty short featurette on Ryan Reynold's transformation.Deleted Scenes - Less than ten minutes of unfinished footage from five scenes. Nothing worth writing about.UltraViolet Digital Copy - As always with UltraViolet it's not a true digital copy, but a code so you can download it from a website.I think we actually should have a Green Lantern franchise, but the way this has started it may not happen. This movie misses the mark on all the elements that make a good superhero movie. If you are into flashy effects and action you may be like many others and really love this film. If you need more than just a popcorn flick you may as well pass or watch it on TV. Maybe the Green Lantern will be picked up again and reworked to something that's worthy of the title.Justice League #1 Digital Comic - This little bonus is from the new 52 comics relaunch that DC was doing. You get the full digital comic.Preview of Green Lantern: The Animated Series - It's a short preview of the cartoon.PS3 Arkham City Character Skin Code - Pretty cool extra if you have the game and console. It's the Sinestro Corps Batman suit.",2,Misses the mark on what it takes to make a good superhero movie,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,4868,"['movie', 'taken', 'lot', 'flak', 'many', 'different',

1403669,A1RU5B8SDUYPF2,B004EPZ07K,Steve G. Bjorg,"[2, 2]","This review is not about the movie itself, but the included Digital Copy using UltraViolet (UV).  If you're read other reviews, you'll have seen that UV is NOT compatible with iTunes, but instead requires its own playback client (Flixster).  This review is about my experience with the process and service.The movie comes with a card that contains the UV code and the web site information where to register.  The sign-up process took 5 minutes and was pretty simple.  To my surprise, I didn't just get access to the ""Green Lantern"" movie, but also to ""Green Lantern: Emerald Knights"".  I don't know if that was part of a promotion or if every copy comes with it, but either way, I was positively surprised by this.  I've used Flixster on the Kindle Fire and iPhone 4S.  It works great on both devices.  I have NOT tried using AirPlay on the iPhone to see if I could send the movie to the Apple TV.My only annoyance at the moment is that the Flixster app shows ads at times when you start it up.  There are no ads during the movie, so it's not disruptive.  However, I would have preferred if they had a dedicated UV playback app instead of putting it into Flixster, which is also used for other services where ads can be justified.In short, if you're holding back on buying this package, because of UV, don't worry about it.  I was lucky to pick up this movie during Black Friday sales for $9.99 and thought that even if UV doesn't work, I'll still have the DVD and Bluray as fallback.  I'm glad I did and I would not hesitate to buy other UV movies in the future.  That said, if given a choice, I would opt for the old Digital Copy via iTunes since I'm more familiar with it.Hope this helps!",4,UltraViolet works on Kindle Fire & iPhone 4S,1322697600,"12 1, 2011",2011,1691,"['review', 'not', 'movie', 'included', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'using', 'UltraViolet', 'UV', ""'re"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'have', 'seen', 'UV', 'NOT', 'compatible', 'iTunes', 'instead', 'own', 'playback', 'client', 'Flixster', 'review', 'experience', 'process', 'service.The', 'movie', 'card', 'UV', 'code', 'web', 'site', 'information', 'where', 'register', 'sign-up', 'process', 'took', '5', 'minutes', 'was', 'pretty', 'simple', 'surprise', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'access', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'movie', 'also', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Emerald', 'Knights', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'part', 'promotion', 'copy', 'way', 'was', 'positively', 'surprised', ""'ve"", 'used', 'Flixster', 'Kindle', 'Fire', 'iPhone', '4S', 'great', 'devices', 'have', 'NOT', 'tried', 'using', 'AirPlay', 'iPhone', 'see', 'could', 'send', 'movie', 'Apple', 'TV.My', 'only', 'annoyance', 'moment', 'Flixster', 'app', 'ads', 'times', 'when', 'start', 'up', 'are', 'ads', 'movie', 'not', 'disruptive', 'However', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'had', 'dedicated', 'UV', 'playback', 'app', 'instead', 'putting', 'Flixster', 'also', 'used', 'other', 'services', 'where', 'ads', 'can', 'be', 'justified.In', 'short', ""'re"", 'holding', 'back', 'buying', 'package', 'UV', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'was', 'lucky', 'pick', 'up', 'movie', 'Black', 'Friday', 'sales', '9.99', 'thought', 'even', 'UV', ""n't"", 'work', ""'ll"", 'still', 'have', 'DVD', 'Bluray', 'fallback', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'would', 'not', 'hesitate', 'buy', 'other', 'UV', 'movies', 'future', 'said', 'given', 'choice', 'would', 'opt', 'old', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'iTunes', ""'m"", 'more', 'familiar', 'it.Hope']",Green Lantern

1403672,A1CLUR3JCYO0TQ,B004EPZ07K,stevie,"[1, 4]","Ok..........where to begin. This movie sucked. I'm sorry. Sometimes movies just suck. I heard Warner Bros spent Avatar money on this movie, marketing it as the big action adventure. Woah. Firstly, the Green Lantern is not even in the second tier of super heroes. He is so far down the chain among notables such as batman, spiderman and superman. I doubt most people even knew who this was. I knew who it was, but I never wanted to be green lantern for halloween. However, the trailers for it looked interesting enough and there was nothing out at the time. I saw it in theaters. I don't know what you get in the blu-ray version. It may not be worth it unless there is a free copy of spiderman 2 in there.Hal Jordan is cocky test pilot. For some reason, the lanterns choose him to be their next guardian. Apparently, the universe is full of green lanterns and they pick their members very carefully, but hall doesn't understand why they would pick him over everyone else. The usual super hero cliches begin. He gets powers. Learns them. Makes wise guy comments while doing so. Fights inner demons. Learn the ""real"" reason why he has been given these abilities. Fights a lame villain with a huge head. Fight another villain who is an escaped space monster. Fight said villain in large metropolitan area. Rescue a girl.What should be cool about this movie is that the Green Lantern can create stuff with his mind. A giant fist? Yes. Machine gun? Yes. Giant ramp resembling hot wheels? Yes....? This is where the movie really gets cheesy. In one scene, a helicopter, after launching from a helipad, quickly spins out of control endangering the people below. There is a party going on down below and no party is complete without helicopter launch pads. I dont know. Maybe I'm just a high roller. What does the Green Lantern do? He clips the wings which causes the helicopter to pummel to the ground. UH OH! Its going too fast and now its sliding on the ground? What does the Green Lantern do now? He makes a ramp out of thin air for the sliding machine to go onto. Yes....a ramp. In the effort to make this movie cool, no solution is ever practical or ground in common sense for the green lantern. Extravagance is on Hal's mind. Any number of things springs to mind here. What if I had these powers? I'm sure you thought you could either make giant arms and punch the thing away, build a wall to stop it, or blow it up with a canon (something he does use later in the movie).

I was skeptical about those reviews, due to my preconceptions about the character and story itself.Getting this right out of the way, I am a comic fan. A fan of Green Lantern in comic book format for decades has perhaps given me some insight and perspective that many going in with no prior knowledge would not have. I watched this with my wife, who is not familiar with the comics or the story at all. She asked me a few minor questions about the universe that was presented to her through this film, but overall was more pleased with it than when we watched Thor or X-Men First Class. Yes, She enjoyed it and found less flaws in this as one story than either of the largely praised films from the publication competition. The reviews I believe to have been biased from the get-go do not do justice to this film.I do believe they anticipated making a franchise out of Green Lantern, and not merely limiting it to this film alone. The setup for viewer understanding of the Guardians of the Galaxy granting power rings to the Corps of Green Lanterns was well done. The alien designs were accessible enough and the only major design flaw I saw was in the look of Parallax, which could have been done better if it had stuck with the look of the fear entity from the comics. Aside from the look of the main villain, I thought they did an excellent job setting up a vast and expansive universe that can easily hold the interest of a casual viewer. You do not have to have any prior knowledge of the comics to understand the story, and the character development felt natural and legitimate. I would definitely recommend this to anyperson that enjoys fun action dramas and is willing to suspend disbelief enough to accept a scifi story where we are not alone in the universe.",5,Cohesive Story that was Fun with Great Visual Effects,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,1834,"['heard', 'horrible', 'things', 'movie', 'initial', 'reviews', 'was', 'skeptical', 'reviews', 'due', 'preconceptions', 'character', 'story', 'itself.Getting', 'right', 'way', 'am', 'comic', 'fan', 'fan', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'comic', 'book', 'format', 'decades', 'perhaps', 'given', 'insight', 'perspective', 'many', 'going', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'watched', 'wife', 'who', 'not', 'familiar', 'comics', 'story', 'asked', 'few', 'minor', 'questions', 'universe', 'was', 'presented', 'film', 'overall', 'was', 'more', 'pleased', 'when', 'watched', 'Thor', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'Yes', 'enjoyed', 'found', 'less', 'flaws', 'one', 'story', 'largely', 'praised', 'films', 'publication', 'competition', 'reviews', 'believe', 'have', 'been', 'biased', 'get-go', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'film.I', 'do', 'believe', 'anticipated', 'making', 'franchise', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'not', 'merely', 'limiting', 'film', 'alone', 'setup', 'viewer', 'understanding', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'granting', 'power', 'rings', 'Corps', 'Green', 'Lanterns', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'alien', 'designs', 'were', 'accessible', 'enough', 'only', 'major', 'design', 'flaw', 'saw', 'was', 'look', 'Parallax', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'had', 'stuck', 'look', 'fear', 'entity', 'comics', 'Aside', 'look', 'main', 'villain', 'thought', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'setting', 'up', 'vast', 'expansive', 'universe', 'can', 'easily', 'hold', 'interest', 'casual', 'viewer', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'have', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'comics', 'understand', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'felt', 'natural', 'legitimate', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'anyperson', 'fun', 'action', 'dramas', 'willing', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'enough', 'accept', 'scifi', 'story', 'where', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'universe']",Green Lantern

I am the guy who notices all the things the film makers got wrong.  ""How can Superman talk in space?""  ""Wolverine can't have an Admantium bullet pierce his skull!!""  ""Why does Magneto have none of the powers he does in the comic book?""  ""Why doesn't Donald Duck wear pants?""  Needless to say I'm a stickler for questions and for details.This movie failed on many levels.  **Some spoilers ahead**,  First off Paralax is not a former Guardian, it is the first being to feel fear in the Universe.  Paralax is more like a powerful spirit, not a space octupus.  When it is seen, it looks like a yellow bug, a fearsome yellow bug.  The Guardian's would never in a billion years turn to the power of fear, and never make a ring to channel it.  Also why would there even be a Yellow Power battery?  The Guardians would not make such a thing.  Ryan Reynalds sucked as Hal Jordan, stick to stupid comedies Ryan, your no superhero.  Also your Deadpool sucked.  Blake Lively is a terrible actress as well.  Michael Clark Duncan was the wrong voice for Kilawog.  Mark Strong was wrong for Sinestro.  Sinestro should look more like Lee Van Cleef...The Green Lantern's powers were imagined wrong in the movie.  No auras envelope their bodies like in the comics or tv.  The power rings looked all wrong.  The costumes looked like crap also, like they were painted on or something.  Also the power ring's battery looked like something that was half assed at the last minute.Action wise this film was extremely weak.  Even worse than Iron-Man 1.Also Hal ""defeated"" Paralax way too easily in the film.  First of all Hal in the comics up until 5 years ago could not defeat Paralax.  I doubt a sun could kill it.  Hal was actually possessed by Paralax and did horrible things before dying.  He became the Spectre for a while...Aliens were rarely seen in the movie, with the rest of the Green Lantern core only seen in glimpses.In conclusion.

1403688,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B004EPZ07K,Theo,"[1, 1]","This is a deeply flawed film. But still, I think, an underrated one. A film probably not _quite_ fully deserving of its profoundly unimpressive box office numbers and many critical pannings.The best thing about this movie are its visuals. Here, it's utterly electrifying and completely true to the original comic book vision. On this level it also benefits enormously from taking itself entirely seriously, a strength that unfortunately does not flow through into too many other aspects of the work.The problems, you see, are in the writing.It has been said that at the heart of all stories there is only one story: the hero's journey to find him or her self. That's what we get here. The trouble is, this hero's inner quest is utterly banal. The lessons learned are about as deep and interesting as those to be found in the latest disposable self-help paperback chock full of dime-store psychobabble. Or even, dare I say it, penny arcade psychobabble.Incidentally, while we're on the subject of character, to be completely fair, even though the leading man and lady seem to have been chosen mainly on the basis of their looks, both do at least a credible job of standing up and reading their lines. Of course, we're still left with the problem that those lines suck, but yes, Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively both put in a solid if unremarkable showing. The only really noteworthy performance is by Mark Strong as Sinestro. What's truly impressive here is that we do get to see the well-intentioned man that Sinestro starts out as, while just subtly hinting at the tragic flaws that will ultimately lead to his damnation.Strong's work aside, the best performances in this film are by those who are merely lending their voices to various CGI creations. This includes Geoffry Rush who provides the voice of Tomar-Re, and Michael Duncan in the role of Kilowog. The only other actor I'd like to pick out by name is Clancy Brown, who provides the voice of Paralax. While best known for his role as the Kurgan in the original Highlander, he's also had a very successful voice acting career. In Bruce Timm's original DC Animiated Universe, Brown owned Lex Luthor like Kevin Conroy owned Batman, although sadly, he never seemed to receive the same level of recognition for doing so. While hardly used to his fullest potential in this film, he is at least worthy of an honorable mention.Fundamentally, I would have to say that the problem with this work is that the director and screenwriters didn't take what they were doing even the tiniest bit seriously. I'd hazard a guess to say that these are not people who watch - or read - anything in the superhero genre in their off-hours. So on the most fundamental level, what I really think was lacking here was any respect at all for the source material.When someone like Frank Miller comes along and thinks seriously about who his characters are and why they do the things they do, it shows. Similarly so on the acting front when people like Christian Bale and Kevin Conroy portray the Bat. But when someone comes along and says ""Hey, let's do a summer blockbuster - we'll make tons of money!"", that also shows. Because frankly, that's the kind of thinking that shines through in this mediocrity.It doesn't completely suck. I suspect that somewhere, far behind the scenes, deep in the CGI department, there were some geek true believers who sincerely loved the Green Lantern mythos.Unfortunately, their work is very close to being the only thing in this movie that's worth watching.Theo.",3,Visually Glorious But Poorly Written,1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,3526,"['deeply', 'flawed', 'film', 'still', 'think', 'underrated', 'one', 'film', 'probably', 'not', '_quite_', 'fully', 'deserving', 'profoundly', 'unimpressive', 'box', 'office', 'numbers', 'many', 'critical', 'pannings.The', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'are', 'visuals', 'Here', 'utterly', 'electrifying', 'completely', 'true', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'vision', 'level', 'also', 'benefits', 'enormously', 'taking', 'entirely', 'seriously', 'strength', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'flow', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'aspects', 'work.The', 'problems', 'see', 'are', 'writing.It', 'been', 'said', 'heart', 'stories', 'only', 'one', 'story', 'hero', 'journey', 'find', 'self', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'trouble', 'hero', 'inner', 'quest', 'utterly', 'banal', 'lessons', 'learned', 'are', 'deep', 'interesting', 'be', 'found', 'latest', 'disposable', 'self-help', 'paperback', 'chock', 'full', 'dime-store', 'psychobabble', 'even', 'dare', 'say', 'arcade', 'psychobabble.Incidentally', ""'re"", 'subject', 'character', 'be', 'completely', 'fair', 'even', 'leading', 'man', 'lady', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'chosen', 'mainly', 'basis', 'looks', 'do', 'least', 'credible', 'job', 'standing', 'up', 'reading', 'lines', 'course', ""'re"", 'still', 'left', 'problem', 'lines', 'suck', 'yes', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Blake', 'Lively', 'put', 'solid', 'unremarkable', 'showing', 'only', 'really', 'noteworthy', 'performance', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'Sinestro', 'What', 'truly', 'impressive', 'here', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'well-intentioned', 'man', 'Sinestro', 'out', 'just', 'subtly', 'hinting', 'tragic', 'flaws', 'will', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'damnation.Strong', 'work', 'aside', 'best', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'who', 'are', 'merely', 'lending', 'voices', 'various', 'CGI', 'creations', 'Geoffry', 'Rush', 'who', 'voice', 'Tomar-Re', 'Michael', 'Duncan', 'role', 'Kilowog', 'only', 'other', 'actor', ""'d"", 'like', 'pick', 'out', 'name', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'who', 'voice', 'Paralax', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'Kurgan', 'original', 'Highlander', 'also', 'had', 'very', 'successful', 'voice', 'acting', 'career', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'original', 'DC', 'Animiated', 'Universe', 'Brown', 'owned', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'owned', 'Batman', 'sadly', 'never', 'seemed', 'receive', 'same', 'level', 'recognition', 'doing', 'so', 'hardly', 'used', 'fullest', 'potential', 'film', 'least', 'worthy', 'honorable', 'mention.Fundamentally', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'problem', 'work', 'director', 'screenwriters', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'even', 'tiniest', 'bit', 'seriously', ""'d"", 'hazard', 'guess', 'say', 'are', 'not', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'read', 'anything', 'superhero', 'genre', 'off-hours', 'So', 'most', 'fundamental', 'level', 'what', 'really', 'think', 'was', 'lacking', 'here', 'was', 'respect', 'source', 'material.When', 'someone', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'along', 'seriously', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'why', 'do', 'things', 'do', 'Similarly', 'so', 'acting', 'front', 'when', 'people', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'portray', 'Bat', 'when', 'someone', 'along', 'Hey', 'let', 'do', 'summer', 'blockbuster', ""'ll"", 'make', 'tons', 'money', 'also', 'frankly', 'kind', 'thinking', 'mediocrity.It', ""n't"", 'completely', 'suck', 'suspect', 'somewhere', 'far', 'scenes', 'deep', 'CGI', 'department', 'were', 'geek', 'true', 'believers', 'who', 'sincerely', 'loved', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'mythos.Unfortunately', 'work', 'very', 'close', 'being', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching.Theo']",Green Lantern

But then not many people knew who Iron Man was, either.Whatever the case, this is a great movie, it just didn't find its audience unfortunately. Not everything about it works. The computer-painted-on costume just looked weird, and as much as I like Ryan Reynolds, I don't think he was suitable for this part. His pretty boy smartass charm works in his other films, but as a longtime GL fan, I pictured this role going to a more ruggedly handsome actor who can play it straight, like John Hamm.The story also suffers from the common error of trying to fit too many villians into the story. You get Hector Hammond, Sinestro (not a villian yet, but that's set up at the end for the probably-not-forthcoming sequel), and Parallax. It's all too much. This is the kind of stuff that wrecked ""Spider-Man 3"", and it dilutes this movie as well.The film is gorgeously shot if you're a fan of CGI animation, though I wouldn't fault anyone for finding it all too overwhelming. It should definitely have been a bigger hit than it was, and I hope they continue the franchise.

It's NOT a digital copy, but rather an authorization to access a streaming video of the original cut of the movie online. This is NOT the package I pre-ordered! When I saw the commercials for the ""UltraViolet"" digital copy, I thought there would be some special feature-- I never dreamed that special feature would be WB promising me a digital copy that I couldn't use in iTunes EVEN THOUGH EVERY OTHER DIGITAL COPY OF A MOVIE DOES. The digital copy you do get (IF you can get the website to work!) has to be played on some kind of Adobe player THAT WILL NOT PLAY THE FILE. So you're stuck with their online streaming swill even though you were promised a digital copy.Sure they said ""UltraViolet,"" but NO ONE KNEW WHAT THAT MEANT, and Warner Brothers did NOT explain it. I'm sure the people at the top are scrambling to figure out where to point the finger and how to explain to consumers what they didn't know and when they didn't know it, or how to blame consumers themselves, or pirates, or space aliens. Frankly, I don't care about the excuses. When I see ""digital copy"" I expect a digital copy and THEY KNOW IT. I did NOT expect to be locked into some kind of online digital cloud where it could only be watched at their whim on the device of their choosing-- in addition to being taken away at any time.I can't return this for a refund because it's an open movie, nor can I exchange it for a different version. So I can't afford to get the digital copy from iTunes for the iPod my autistic nephew uses. My nephew doesn't understand why he can't watch this on his iPod and I can't explain it to him. All I can say is that their digital cloud is a bunch of hot air that smells REALLY bad, and this is a slap in the face to both myself and my nephew. I never did keep much track of which studio did what movie, but I will from now on. I will never forgive this studio for my nephew's heartbreak, nor will I forget it.11/11/2011 **UPDATE** Five stars for Amazon customer service for refunding me the full purchase prices for this falsely advertised product!

1403700,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B004EPZ07K,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[1, 1]","This movie is pure science fiction fantasy.  Right off the bat it tells us this by entering us into the story with some linear exposition.  Once it establishes this new ""reality"" it introduces us to the antagonists and protagonists quickly (the extended version here doing so a bit better than the theatrical version but not much is lost in the theatrical version).  The story is a trifle of one man being chosen to be a savior of sorts who essentially doesn't believe in himself but comes to believe in himself because he comes to believe in something more than himself (saving the world).  Standard stuff really.  What elevates this movie then?  For one, it is absolutely gorgeous to look at.  The colors are deep and vibrant.  For another, it gives us unambiguous characters and an easy to follow story that makes it perfect popcorn fare (I realize that this is enough to significantly downgrade its ratings in a lot of people's eyes but shouldn't they know that they are getting a certain type of movie when they see the...oh, preview for this one?).  And for another, the ""reality"" in this film is sufficiently fascinating with plenty of supporting characters that can be explored.  Like many others I can't figure out why this movie got thrown under the bus when all of Marvel's fare enjoyed moderate success and decent critic review.  After seeing ""X-men: First Class"", ""Thor"", and ""Captain America"" I'd have to say that ""Green Lantern"" beats all of them out in my book (barely ""Thor"").  Sure X-men gave you some subtext and philosophical arguments to chew on and interlaced its story with our history (something the Cap film should have done a lot better) but the effects in X-men were less than stellar and the characters, while better drawn out than in Lantern, required that they be drawn out more.I will admit that I don't do the digital download/ ultraviolet copy things yet so, please, if that's your thing take a look at the one star reviews here.  They will be important to you.Lastly, I wanted to share one thing about this film that did bother me.  The ""hero"" of the story has looks, has a pretty adoring girl, has raw talent; in short, he's the supposed ""dream"" many want to be.  He's able to overcome his one flaw.  So, by the end of the story the ""pretty person"" gets everything and remains in their exalted status as said ""pretty person"" who is really pretty and now so much more.  By contrast you have one of the ""villains"" (played sympathetically and extremely well by Peter Sarsgaard--good job there) who is presented as a competent sad-sack.  He doesn't have the looks (poor balding guy), he doesn't have the pretty adoring girl (though said girl is kind to him), and his talent is capable but not superior.  He is not one of the ""pretty people"" (some might say ""below average"") but his heart, while sad at the recognition of loss of being able to get one of the ""pretties"", is also an honest and apparently decent heart at the beginning of the film.  He becomes infected by the uber-villain and undergoes transformations to his character and physical features that turn him into an extremely disgusting individual (inside and out).  Of course he dies.  So, by the end of the story the physically unattractive person loses everything and becomes so much less.  Doesn't this validate our Madison Avenue's view that the pretty are good and the ugly are bad (to put it simplistically)?  It sure did in this film and that's one thing I didn't like about the film.

1403705,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B004EPZ07K,Tom Benton,"[8, 15]","An awful movie, the worst potentially good superhero film since ""Daredevil.""  The problem stems from an excruciatingly simple script, composed by a quartet of television writers, which is entirely devoid of creativity, the absence of which the writers compensate with gaping plot holes.  The hero of the picture is Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds), an arrogant fighter pilot who walks away from everything he cares about because he has daddy issues.  Reynolds doesn't have the power to play a superhero.  He's never seemed so gratingly foolish as when he's trying to do so.  He's like a guy who went to a superhero-themed kegger and started taking himself seriously.  The core fault of this ""Green Lantern"" is that I never for a moment believed Hal Jordan could save anyone, let alone the universe.Blake Lively, on the other hand, is charming and underused, making her transition from ""Gossip Girl"" to the big screen.  But God save the scene if she has to act emotional.  The rest of the cast, which includes Peter Sarsgaard as an increasingly deformed scientist, Mark Strong as Sinestro, Jordan's mentor in the comics and his bully in the film, and Temuera Morrison as Abin Sur, the dying alien who grants Jordan his powers.  They're all forgettable, perhaps save for the aforementioned and appropriately named Ms. Lively.It's only so much their fault.  Besides the trash script, Martin Campbell, who previously directed the Antonio Banderas ""Zorro"" films and twice revitalized the James Bond series (minorly with 1995's ""GoldenEye,"" with Pierce Brosnan; majorly with ""Casino Royale"" in 2006, Daniel Craig's debut), has an uninspired directorial style which also produces dull visuals and poorly-constructed scenes--big pitfalls in what should be a flashy film.  The filmmakers are clearly trying to emulate Richard Donner's original ""Superman,"" from 1978--but that was 1978, and this is 2011.  Superhero films have grown by leaps and bounds since then.This film seems unconscious of that fact, so it also seems derivative and lifeless.  The visual effects are up and down: some are underdeveloped (landscapes, especially on the Green Lanterns' homeplanet, Oa), while others are impressive (Parallax, the demon space entity with an insatiable hunger for fear).  The underappreciated ""Thor"" is a better bet as far as superhero movies are concerned.  Better yet, wait for ""Captain America: The First Avenger,"" released July 22, which, with a sturdy cast, Joe Johnston's direction, and a script co-written by Joss Whedon, the maverick of creative genre writing, seems likely to be the best superhero movie we've seen since ""Iron Man 2.""",2,Nauseating simplicity 'til you're green in the face,1308268800,"06 17, 2011",2011,2628,"['awful', 'movie', 'worst', 'potentially', 'good', 'superhero', 'film', 'Daredevil', 'problem', 'excruciatingly', 'simple', 'script', 'composed', 'quartet', 'television', 'writers', 'entirely', 'devoid', 'creativity', 'absence', 'writers', 'compensate', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'hero', 'picture', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'arrogant', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'who', 'away', 'everything', 'about', 'daddy', 'issues', 'Reynolds', ""n't"", 'have', 'power', 'play', 'superhero', 'never', 'seemed', 'so', 'gratingly', 'foolish', 'when', 'trying', 'do', 'so', 'guy', 'who', 'went', 'superhero-themed', 'kegger', 'started', 'taking', 'seriously', 'core', 'fault', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'never', 'moment', 'believed', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'could', 'save', 'anyone', 'let', 'alone', 'universe.Blake', 'Lively', 'other', 'hand', 'charming', 'underused', 'making', 'transition', 'Gossip', 'Girl', 'big', 'screen', 'God', 'save', 'scene', 'act', 'emotional', 'rest', 'cast', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'increasingly', 'deformed', 'scientist', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'Sinestro', 'Jordan', 'mentor', 'comics', 'bully', 'film', 'Temuera', 'Morrison', 'Abin', 'Sur', 'dying', 'alien', 'who', 'Jordan', 'powers', ""'re"", 'forgettable', 'perhaps', 'save', 'aforementioned', 'appropriately', 'named', 'Ms.', 'Lively.It', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'fault', 'trash', 'script', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'who', 'previously', 'directed', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Zorro', 'films', 'twice', 'revitalized', 'James', 'Bond', 'series', 'minorly', '1995', 'GoldenEye', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'majorly', 'Casino', 'Royale', '2006', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'debut', 'uninspired', 'directorial', 'style', 'also', 'dull', 'visuals', 'poorly-constructed', 'scenes', 'big', 'pitfalls', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'flashy', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'clearly', 'trying', 'emulate', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'original', 'Superman', '1978', 'was', '1978', '2011', 'Superhero', 'films', 'have', 'grown', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'then.This', 'film', 'unconscious', 'fact', 'also', 'derivative', 'lifeless', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'up', 'are', 'underdeveloped', 'landscapes', 'especially', 'Green', 'Lanterns', 'homeplanet', 'Oa', 'others', 'are', 'impressive', 'Parallax', 'demon', 'space', 'entity', 'insatiable', 'hunger', 'fear', 'underappreciated', 'Thor', 'better', 'bet', 'as', 'far', 'superhero', 'movies', 'are', 'concerned', 'Better', 'yet', 'wait', 'Captain', 'America', 'First', 'Avenger', 'released', 'July', '22', 'sturdy', 'cast', 'Joe', 'Johnston', 'direction', 'script', 'co-written', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'maverick', 'creative', 'genre', 'writing', 'likely', 'be', 'best', 'superhero', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Iron', 'Man', '2']",Green Lantern
1403706,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B004EPZ07K,Tom Birkenstock,"[5, 5]","Over the last decade, the summer and holiday months have been littered with the cast off remains of failed franchises.  Eager for the consistent influx of cash that popular series like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, or Twilight bring in over the course of years, or even decades, studios have been caught counting their chickens long before they have hatched, hoping that whatever rebooted 80s cartoon, young adult novel, or underused superhero will leaven the strain of actually producing new material.  Some of these failures have taken on the veneer of cult success (I would argue this in the case of the Wachowski's Speed Racer or Joe Johnston's The Rocketeer), where others fail to live up to the promise of their source material (such as Jonah Hex or The Golden Compass), and still others should never have been put into production in the first place (Prince of Persia, Battlefield Earth).  And while there have been rumors of a Green Lantern sequel, I have the feeling that the first film's poor showing at the box office will dissuade the bean counters from risking another go at DC's space cop.  And that's a shame, not because the first film was such a triumph, but because, despite plenty of flaws, there's a lot of potential in the Green Lantern, even if much of it is squandered by the movie's end.I watched Green Lantern after reading some damning reviews, so imagine my surprise when, for at least the first half of the film, the movie turned out to be an engaging balance of sci-fi spectacle and carefully executed character building.  We begin the film in the far reaches of space where some alien astronauts stumble upon a trapped entity known as Parallax who feeds on these victims and escapes.  Parallax proceeds to chase down and mortally wound the Green Lantern who had trapped him in the first place, Abin Sur.  Sur manages to escape from Parallax and crash land on Earth where he, knowing how little time he has left, instructs his ring, the source of a Green Lantern's power, to find a suitable replacement.The ring eventually chooses Hal Jordan, a test pilot for experimental aircraft.  Hal's portrayed as a womanizer whose talents as a pilot far outstrip his discipline.  He works for Ferris Aircraft and has some romantic history with the boss's daughter, Carol Ferris, who also happens to balance her career helping run the family business with her roles as a test pilot along with Hal.  The two must run a demonstration for the government in hopes that Uncle Sam will buy their non-manned fighter pilot drones (take that China!).  While the ultimate goal of this demonstration is to show how good the drones are, Hal decides to break the rules of engagement by taking his jet much higher than permitted, which allows him to take out the drones, but also forces him to crash his plane in the process.  Naturally, Carol is upset when Hal not only uncovers flaws in their product but also trashes a multi-million dollar piece of equipment.Hal is played by Ryan Reynolds, who got his start as a cartoony wiseass in sitcoms and teen comedies but has since attempted to break his way into marginally more serious action work, and he has spent years trying to prove himself as a potential blockbuster lead.  Here his ability to crack a joke not only serves to accentuate his character's freewheeling nature, but also helps ground the more absurdist aspects of a comic book character who was created fifty years ago.  The movie manages to be funny without becoming jokey.  Reynolds also happens to have great chemistry with love interest Carol Ferris, played by Blake Lively.  The two of them have a surprisingly emotionally complicated scene at a local bar for pilots that could have been sliced into a more dramatic film without much trouble.  The central love story reminded me of the scenes in another film by directors Martin Campbell, the James Bond reboot Casino Royale, whose romance between Bond and Vesper served as the heart of the film.It's not long after he downs the company jet that Hal is swept away by Abin Sur's ring and taken to the crash site of Sur's escape pod where the dying alien tells him how to use the ring.  After figuring out the basics Hal is whisked away to the planet Oa, the headquarters of the Guardians, a race of blue aliens who forged the Green Lantern rings in order to form the Green Lantern Corps, a group tasked with policing the entire universe.  The planet Oa is beautifully filmed, a strange mixture of darkened crags, smooth surfaces of technology, and tasteful waves of color.  It is as if an aurora borealis went off in an Apple store after hours.  Here Hal learns of the history of the Green Lanterns and begins his training with Kilowog, a beast of an alien with the face of a pig, the body of a brick wall, and the voice, conveniently enough, of Michael Clark Duncan.It's at this point in the movie where I excitedly awaited for the film to really take off.  Until now there had been some exciting action and nice character work.  Hal had been firmly established as a screw up, adrift in life, hoping for something bigger, and now that fate has handed him the chance to join the Green Lantern Corps, he presumably has a chance to right his course in life.  But in an incredibly contrived moment, he decides that he's not up to snuff, quits the corps and returns to Earth (although, strangely enough, he is allowed to keep the ring).  Instead of the epic space opera I was expecting, the filmmakers decides on something far more quotidian: a superhero movie.  The rest of the film goes through the usual superhero motions: the main character reveals himself to the public by bravely saving hundreds of people and afterwards visits the love interest/damsel in distress.  Green Lantern is a decidedly schizophrenic movie.  Where the first half of the film provides the perfect set up for the ""hero's journey,"" a story about one character being plucked from the mundane world and lifted into an exciting realm of adventure, the second half of the film seems content on playing superhero connect the dots.  There is even a second villain, a scientist who becomes infected by Parallax, who is obviously there to make sure the action doesn't stray too far from Earth.I'm convinced that the studio didn't really know what they had with the Green Lantern.  Unlike Batman, Spider-Man, or even Superman, the Green Lantern Corps lends itself to interplanetary superheroics more in the vein of Star Wars and Flash Gordon than Iron Man.  But this is also what makes the character exciting.  Where we have seen the basic outline of a superhero movie time and again, Green Lantern offers the chance of more science fiction tropes, which could potentially differentiate him from the glut of other superhero movies.  Instead of shying away from the imaginatively bizarre, the filmmakers should have embraced the alien aspects of the Green Lantern mythos.  Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of Green Lantern is that it represents a missed opportunity.  The few moments we spend in space are exciting because of their promise of the weird, and because they are one of the few images of space made by people who have actually looked at photographs from the Hubble Telescope.  Instead of peregrine flights of fancy, the movie clings tight to formula, and suffered for it, both artistically and at the box office.",3,A Schizophrenic Movie,1333756800,"04 7,

After destroying an expensive jet, pilot Hal Jordan (Reynolds) becomes chosen to wear the ring of the Green Lanterns.  Thinking the choice was a mistake he wonders what to do with his new powers.  Being a big Ryan Reynolds fan I was actually looking forward to this movie.  I did enjoy it, but I think with the overload of comic book movies coming out lately this is just another movie that isn't as good as the last one.  I have never been a big comic book fan and this one just seemed like a cross between Spiderman and Superman.  I think that my biggest problem with the movie is that there was not as much action as I was expecting. While the humor of Reynolds is used effectively, thier is also not enough of that either.  This may sound like I'm bashing it, but I'm really not. I did really enjoy this one, but after ""Thor"" this one wasn't as good.  While the effects were very good, and the acting was actually very, very good too (hard not to be with the cast) it just felt like there was something missing. Don't listen to all the bad reviews on this one, it was entertaining and fun, just a few steps away from being great.  Overall, I liked it, but it felt like it could have been better.

1403710,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B004EPZ07K,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[5, 7]","Movie - 4.0When I initially saw this in theaters I had no exposure to the GL franchise whatsoever aside from a few Justice League episodes. I saw the movie, loved the potential, but couldn't really tell if prior knowledge was required to enjoy this even more. Afterward, I watched the two GL animated feature films First Flight and Emerald Knights. First Flight really caught my attention, so I set out to read up what I could on my new-found interest. And after seeing those animated movies, doing the research, watching the extras on this BD, and finally re-watching the film with everything I learned, I have to say I became quite interested in what the GL franchise holds. The story begins on a moon in a distant galaxy where a group of aliens have accidentally discovered and freed a being named Parallax. Parallax had been imprisoned there by a Green Lantern named Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison) and was left in captivity so it could no longer wreak havoc throughout the universe with its terrible power. After escaping, Parallax finds Abin Sur in an attempt to exact its revenge. Mortally wounded, Abin Sur barely escapes his ship and sets course for the nearest inhabited planet: Earth. In a last, desperate attempt to transfer its powers to a worthy successor, his ring chooses rowdy test pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds). With the ring, Hal is entrusted with the power and duty of serving the Green Lantern Corp, an intergalactic military force responsible for upholding the peace across the farthest reaches of the universe. But upon initial skepticism by senior Green Lantern Sinestro (Mark Strong), Hal would have to earn the confidence of the Corps and its founders, the Guardians. Meanwhile, Hal must overcome his fear of obligation and face his inner demons as Parallax makes its way towards Earth.What draws me to this film is its basic concept of good vs. evil and the core values of what it means to be a hero. All the traits that usually accompany this kind of status (power, responsibility, hope, etc.) are there just like any other superhero flick. But I find it interesting how the franchise takes these ideals beyond the mere scope of Earth and expands them across the vastness of the universe. This is very lightly touched upon by the dynamic relationship and beliefs between Hal and Sinestro: one believing that willpower is what drives life, with the other believing that life is maintained through the oppression of fear. Sadly, though, the two problems I have with this film is that it spends too much time on earth and not enough across space, and the fact that the rest of the Corps like Tomar-Re, Kilowog, and Sinestro hardly get any screen time for development. I think all four of the main Lanterns were excellently cast, particularly Mark Strong. And I really hope that if a sequel comes out that they expand upon everyone's characters in greater detail, especially the clash of ideals between Hal and Sinestro. By the way, the Extended Cut of the film is greatly encouraged. It's only 9:43 longer, but it actually does a much better job putting Hal, Carol, and Hector's characters into context for later events.Video - 4.5- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC- Video resolution: 1080p- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1To start off, yes, aesthetically it's a fairly dark movie. Black levels are heavy and tend to crush some of the details and delineation making textures appear somewhat smudgy and a little hard to see at times, but that's exactly how it appeared in theaters and should be attributed to the cinematography. It's not any fault of the studio for making a bad transfer, so what you see is what you get. However, because of the heavy blacks I personally feel that colors receive a significantly bigger boost in boldness and vibrancy. The greens and yellows of the color palette are especially strong and were even addressed in the extras as an aspect they really wanted to nail in terms of presentation. Saturation is a little high as well and ends up making human flesh tones seem like everyone has a nice tan, but it also helps in accentuating the looks in all the alien lifeforms. Tomar-Re, Kilowog, and Sinestro, in particular, look great and very detailed in comparison to other versions of them I've seen in both the GL animated films and various drawings from the comic book art. And Blake Lively, mm.. Despite her casting being a little too young for the actual role of Carol she is, indeed, a beauty and I had trouble keeping my eyes off her in just about every scene she was in.Contrast feels very well-balanced, especially when she's on-screen (and I guess for Reynolds if you're a gal that likes looking at him, too). But yeah, I didn't think overall detail was as bad as so many other people make it out to be. In fact, compared to Sherlock Holmes and Kick-Ass (two other films that I feel had more problematic color schemes) this looks way better. Sherlock was not only crushed, but the art direction and costuming was considerably grey and foggy, whereas Kick-Ass had that weird ""no blacks"" palette to mimic the comic (ironically, both films also star Mark Strong). My favorite scenes are when Hal visits his nephew (it's probably the most ""normal"" down-to-earth-looking scene you'll find) for it's balanced and filmic texture, and then probably when Hal goes to Oa for his introduction into the Corps and initial training for its colorfulness and CG integration.Audio - 5.0Languages- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1- French: Dolby Digital 5.1- Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1- Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1- Thai: Dolby Digital 5.1- Extended Cut: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 onlySubtitles- English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Indonesian, Korean, Mandarin (Simplified), ThaiWhile the video presentation might be questionable for some, the audio should be a no-brainer. Mixed by Michael Keller, Rick Kline, and Mike Prestwood Smith, 2 of who worked on such films as Hellboy II, Casino Royale (two of my loudest BDs) and the other nominated for 11 Oscars in Sound, Green Lantern comes with a DTS-HD MA 5.1 track that is sure to give your home theater system a rightful workout. The F-35s in the dogfight sequence are a pretty good indicator of what to expect with a very nice rumble and awesome directionality as the jets fly across the screen (ironically enough, one of these sound mixers also worked on Top Gun, go figure). LFEs are further tested by the occasional pulsing of Hal's power ring or any other green energy effects that either engulf or emanate from him during battle. Another great display is in the presence of Kilowog. When we first meet him on Oa and he tussles with Hal, even his footsteps feel thunderous.Separation is keen, specifically in the GL training sequence and when Hal is fighting Parallax. Whether he's using his constructs, getting pushed around, or having stuff blow up around him, when things start to pick up, action-wise, there's really nothing to complain about. Some reviews argue that just a tiny bit of the dialogue can become indiscernible when the sound gets too loud, but I never lost any of what they were saying (which might've been a word or two like ""run!"" or ""look out!""). Getting back to the directionality, though, I really like the overall sound design and the comic book-esque effects they created. Specifically, I love the sounds the constructs make when they're being created by the Lanterns. The idea of energetic constructs itself feels very imaginative and the kind of clanking and dispersion noises they make when being built and discharged makes for a cool sound that kind of gets my own imagination going. My favorite scenes for reference are the aforementioned dogfight (for its roaring bass and panning effects) and then the scene where Hal is training on Oa (for its great directionality and separation amongst all the fighting and constructs being thrown around).Extras - 4.5- Maximum Movie Mode (162:55)A Picture in Picture application that plays along with the Theatrical Cut of the film. It's not the ""all-out"" version where the director stands in front of split-screens and pauses the thing every now and then to explore an aspect of something, but instead we get DC Entertainment Chief and Green Lantern writer Geoff Johns taking us through a lot of material concerning the making of the film itself. I should also point out that there's a difference between watching MMM and the truncated Focus Points that are available separately from the movie. If you watch MMM in its entirety, it not only gives you the Focus Points, but also stills galleries and additional interview footage with Johns, Ryan Reynolds, director Martin Campbell, and other members of the cast and crew. This was a very big reason for me liking the film as much as I do, as it really shows you the amount of hard work and production that went into making it. I highly recommend everyone give this a viewing, whether you're a fan of the actual comic book series or just a casual movie-goer. It's quite informative.- Focus Points (HD; 46:55 altogether)If you're interested in the film-making process of the movie itself, these offer a lot of background and production notes that fans should really get a kick out of. The following features cover: pre-production and concept art while the movie was in its planning stages and how they eventually portrayed it, the filming of the dogfight and the level of realism Campbell wanted to put into it, the planning process and execution of what and why they chose to do GL's costume completely in CG, the motion-capturing, visual effects, and voice acting of the GL Corps, the prosthetic work that went into Abin Sur, Sinestro, and Hector Hammond, the concept and construction of the Guardians, and then the same for Parallax. Below are the segmented titles and their running times:- The Art of Green Lantern (6:03)- Weapons Hot: The U.C.A.V. Dog Fight (4:04)- Reinventing the Superhero Costume (7:46)- Ring Slinging 101 (5:20)- We are the Corps (5:38)- Acting Under 10 Pounds of Silicone (7:10)- Guardians Revealed (6:10)- When Parallax Attacks (4:42)Other features include:- The Universe According to Green Lantern (HD; 20:12)An exploration of the comic book franchise from the various writers and artists that have worked on Green Lantern over the years. It's a fascinating progression from when the first issue started to about the point of Green Lantern: Rebirth. After watching MMM and all the Focus Points, this was icing on the cake in really getting me hooked on what the comics have to offer. I highly recommend this as a compliment to MMM, and to rookie fans like myself who'd like to know more about the franchise.- Ryan Reynolds Becomes the Green Lantern (HD; 8:48)Thoughts and analysis of the character Hal Jordan from cast and crew. It basically shows Reynolds and a lot of the prep he had to go through: 9 months of working out, doing some of his own stunts, and what he personally found interesting about Hal Jordan that made him want to do the role in the first place.- Deleted Scenes (HD; 7:16)Incomplete ones at that.- Justice League #1 Digital Comic (HD; 9:13)Part of the New 52 lineup. It's the entire issue with automatic moving panels and has some pretty sleek artwork.- Preview of Green Lantern: The Animated Series (SD; 6:32)The art is a little weird, but the storytelling and voice acting have potential.Overall - 4.5By this point, I'm confident in saying that I've become totally enamored with world of Green Lantern. The idea and concept of an intergalactic marine corps looks and sounds like a very cool idea. After seeing the two currently available GL animated features from DC, doing some research around the 'Net, and watching the incredibly informative extras on this BD, I am really excited with the prospect of discovering this franchise and learning a lot more about it. If anyone out there is reading this and can recommend me any graphic novels and such, I'd be more than willing to listen. And hopefully, if Warner can get enough funding together they'll make a much-needed sequel to further expand, what I think is, a really cool concept in the Green Lantern. The video quality looks great to me, but may be a little too dark for others, while the sound should be more than sufficient. And if you're a fan of the film or the franchise itself, definitely give the extras a look and maybe even check out those animated films if you haven't already.

1403712,A185QFJRTB5W93,B004EPZ07K,"TrailsEndWild ""Writer/Researcher""","[1, 1]","I am trying to figure out why this film is almost universally panned.  I can only assume that the reviews are from those who have no familiarity with the comic series or those who do not get any enjoyment out of classic pulp comic books.  The only problem with Green Lantern is that it probably stuck too close to the comic series and did not drift off into some ""Hollywood-esque"" superhero movie.  The fact is, Green Lantern is a ""cosmic"" superhero, and to attempt to portray a movie without incorporating that element would serve a huge disservice to the character.  If the film-makers had tried to keep Green lantern ""down to Earth,"" it would have gone against the entire grain of the traditional series.  The fact is, it is just too bad that this superhero movie was just too comic-like for too many people.  I guess they should have darkened it up like Nolan's Dark Knight series, and then all the wannabee fans could rave about how ""cool"" it was (note: I am not bashing Nolan's 1st or 2nd Batman film [the 3rd was not that good], just he idea that all superhero movies have to be ""dark"" or ""gritty"" these days to play to the vast movie going audience).  All in all, Green Lantern was a fun film.  The only real drawback was the colossal build-up to a ""villain"" that was so easily defeated.  Maybe they can do a better job with that in the next installment.  Having said that, I think the film deserves at least one more in the series, most obviously following up with Sinestro.  Now, that would be a better overall fight.  If you are a classic comic fan, feel free to enjoy this movie and not get taken in by the ""hater crowd.""  I give it 5 stars to attempt to rebalance the rating and get this film where it should be.

To be fair, the movie is not a colossal failure.  It has some wit, the script is actually pretty serviceable, the action is fairly good, but somehow the movie just doesn't feel like a success-- it feels like a rental.  Though there are many superhero movies that hope to be even as passably nifty as Green Lantern (Jonah Hex, Daredevil, Ghost Rider, anyone?), passable niftiness is not the standard that was set by Batman Begins and the Dark Knight, and it was not set by Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, and so on.The movie seems too short. The Green Lantern story line is vast and populous, yet this movie feels oddly compact and undermanned.  It doesn't have enough room to breath, and worst of all, its villain is acutely underwhelming, as if his inclusion in the movie was just an afterthought when the writers realized that they hadn't chosen a villain yet by the time they completed the script.It's a good thing DC has a sure hit with The Dark Knight Rises.-TDW",3,Can't quite compete with recent superhero movies.,1316995200,"09 26, 2011",2011,1152,"['was', 'obviously', 'DC', 'attempt', 'try', 'realize', 'one', 'lesser', 'known', 'characters', 'way', 'Marvel', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Thor', 'Captain', 'America', 'be', 'fair', 'movie', 'not', 'colossal', 'failure', 'wit', 'script', 'actually', 'pretty', 'serviceable', 'action', 'fairly', 'good', 'somehow', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'success', 'rental', 'are', 'many', 'superhero', 'movies', 'hope', 'be', 'even', 'passably', 'nifty', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'Daredevil', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'anyone', 'passable', 'niftiness', 'not', 'standard', 'was', 'set', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'was', 'not', 'set', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Thor', 'Captain', 'America', 'so', 'on.The', 'movie', 'too', 'short', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'story', 'line', 'vast', 'populous', 'yet', 'movie', 'oddly', 'compact', 'undermanned', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'room', 'breath', 'worst', 'villain', 'acutely', 'underwhelming', 'inclusion', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'afterthought', 'when', 'writers', 'realized', 'had', ""n't"", 'chosen', 'villain', 'yet', 'time', 'completed', 'script.It', 'good', 'thing', 'DC', 'sure', 'hit', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises.-TDW']",Green Lantern

The only limit on their abilities is their imagination and the source of those abilities is willpower along with a ring and an actual green lantern. But for the first time in recent history, they are vulnerable. A dark force that draws his power from fear is picking off Lanterns one at a time. Wounded, one Lantern crashes on Earth and his ring seeks out his replacement.Enter Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds). A test pilot for a private aerospace firm, Jordan is brash, sarcastic, and reckless. The ring and lantern find him and bring him, against his will, to his predecessor who informs him of their purpose.Going into this, I kept referring to it (to myself and others) as The Green Hornet without meaning to. Leaving the theater afterwards, I still struggle to distinguish the two. Of course the characters are immensely different as are the stories. The similarities are the tone and the fatally flawed execution. I actually like Reynolds, generally, but maintaining dramatic tension while practically winking at the audience and his fellow cast members is a near impossible task and Reynolds falls far short of accomplishing it.

1403715,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004EPZ07K,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","Made with an estimated budget of $200,000,000, ""Green Lantern"" certainly looks nice. It also has an interesting cast including Ryan Reynolds, Mark Strong, Angela Bassett and Tim Robbins, and is directed by Martin Campbell, who had successfully rebooted the 007 franchise twice (with ""GoldenEye"" and ""Casino Royale""). So, ""Green Lantern"" should have been a great film, but somehow it ended up with a good film held back from greatness by the inept script. A film with four names in its writing credits is not always destined to be inconsistent and mediocre, I know, but watching ""Green Lantern"" almost made me feel that way.The film opens with a brief history of the intergalactic police force Green Lantern Corps, followed by the main story about a fearless (or reckless) test pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds), who is chosen by a power ring of fatally wounded Green Lantern member Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison) as his successor. So far, the film keeps a good pace.But apparently the filmmakers couldn't decide in what way the story should be developed. ""Green Lantern"" tries to tell us so many things at the same time - Hal Jordan's romance with Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), and what he has to learn as a recruit to the Green Lantern Corps; tormented Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) and his descent into the dark side; and the impending danger from fear-eating Parallax. It's like checking the list of problems the third ""Spider-man"" film suffered.I like the light-hearted tone of Green Lantern,"" especially its first half. I like the idea of Hal Jordan creating constructs (like a green-colored catapult to protect the people). There is also an amusing scene sending up the famous balcony scene of the Superman. They may be silly, but fun nonetheless.But with its uneven pace (Hal Jordan's training period on Planet Oa is very short) and underwritten characters (Tim Robbins as Senator Robert Hammond, Hector's father, is wasted), I couldn't help feeling that there seems to be a much better movie buried in ""Green Lantern.""",3,A Missed Opportunity; Still Entertaining,1315872000,"09 13, 2011",2011,2024,"['Made', 'estimated', 'budget', '200,000,000', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'certainly', 'nice', 'also', 'interesting', 'cast', 'including', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'directed', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'who', 'had', 'successfully', 'rebooted', '007', 'franchise', 'twice', 'GoldenEye', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'So', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'somehow', 'ended', 'up', 'good', 'film', 'held', 'back', 'greatness', 'inept', 'script', 'film', 'four', 'names', 'writing', 'credits', 'not', 'always', 'destined', 'be', 'inconsistent', 'mediocre', 'know', 'watching', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'almost', 'made', 'feel', 'way.The', 'film', 'brief', 'history', 'intergalactic', 'police', 'force', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Corps', 'followed', 'main', 'story', 'fearless', 'reckless', 'test', 'pilot', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'chosen', 'power', 'ring', 'fatally', 'wounded', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'member', 'Abin', 'Sur', 'Temuera', 'Morrison', 'successor', 'So', 'far', 'film', 'good', 'pace.But', 'apparently', 'filmmakers', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'what', 'way', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'developed', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'tell', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'same', 'time', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'romance', 'Carol', 'Ferris', 'Blake', 'Lively', 'what', 'learn', 'recruit', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Corps', 'tormented', 'Hector', 'Hammond', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'descent', 'dark', 'side', 'impending', 'danger', 'fear-eating', 'Parallax', 'checking', 'list', 'problems', 'third', 'Spider-man', 'film', 'suffered.I', 'light-hearted', 'tone', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'like', 'idea', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'creating', 'constructs', 'green-colored', 'catapult', 'protect', 'people', 'also', 'amusing', 'scene', 'sending', 'up', 'famous', 'balcony', 'scene', 'Superman', 'may', 'be', 'silly', 'fun', 'nonetheless.But', 'uneven', 'pace', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'training', 'period', 'Planet', 'Oa', 'very', 'short', 'underwritten', 'characters', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Senator', 'Robert', 'Hammond', 'Hector', 'father', 'wasted', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'there', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'buried', 'Green', 'Lantern']",Green Lantern

While a few other comic characters from this company have made it to film like `Watchmen' & `Hellblazer' Still, where are all the other popular DC characters? Our prayers were finally answered this summer with `Green Lantern'First off, I am a huge Green Lantern fan. I love the story and I love the fact that a hero so simple can have such a deep complex life as well as a very deep story. This movie was huge, because the entire DC franchise was weighing it. Success would bring all the other major DC names to the big screen finally. Unfortunately, this film is not the greatest. The acting was not the greatest, but thank goodness Ryan Reynolds was able to do a decent job. Blake was not lively at all as Carol Ferris and Marc Strong who played Sinestro barley got any screen time. The other weakness of the film while it was strength to me was the story. The story of Green Lantern goes far beyond the ring, there is a whole world full of Green Lanterns that protect the entire universe and a story like that may not sit well with people whom have never read the comic and no nothing of the lore. Green Lantern fans will appreciate that aspect, but at the same time will not be entirely satisfied due to the subpar acting.There is a great deal of potential for a sequel to be a better film, especially with the cliffhanger ending. The only problem is due to box office failure, there may not be another film. Still, `Green Lantern' is a fun film and I own it and after seeing it a second I still feel the same way. It is a fun film that the true fan will enjoy, with of potential to be better.Again this is a horrible DVD and I blame it on Blu Ray, there are next to know decent special features and you can only get the extended edition on Blu Ray...shame shame.",3,There is hope...,1319587200,"10 26, 2011",2011,1845,"['film', 'DC', 'Comics', 'only', 'brought', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'versions', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'few', 'other', 'comic', 'characters', 'company', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'Watchmen', 'Hellblazer', 'Still', 'where', 'are', 'other', 'popular', 'DC', 'characters', 'prayers', 'were', 'finally', 'answered', 'summer', 'Green', ""Lantern'First"", 'am', 'huge', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'fan', 'love', 'story', 'love', 'fact', 'hero', 'so', 'simple', 'can', 'have', 'such', 'deep', 'complex', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'deep', 'story', 'movie', 'was', 'huge', 'entire', 'DC', 'franchise', 'was', 'weighing', 'Success', 'would', 'bring', 'other', 'major', 'DC', 'names', 'big', 'screen', 'finally', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'not', 'greatest', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'greatest', 'thank', 'goodness', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'Blake', 'was', 'not', 'lively', 'Carol', 'Ferris', 'Marc', 'Strong', 'who', 'played', 'Sinestro', 'barley', 'got', 'screen', 'time', 'other', 'weakness', 'film', 'was', 'strength', 'was', 'story', 'story', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'far', 'ring', 'whole', 'world', 'full', 'Green', 'Lanterns', 'protect', 'entire', 'universe', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'people', 'whom', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'comic', 'nothing', 'lore', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'aspect', 'same', 'time', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'satisfied', 'due', 'subpar', 'great', 'deal', 'potential', 'sequel', 'be', 'better', 'film', 'especially', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'only', 'problem', 'due', 'box', 'office', 'failure', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'film', 'Still', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'fun', 'film', 'own', 'seeing', 'second', 'still', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'fun', 'film', 'true', 'fan', 'will', 'enjoy', 'potential', 'be', 'better.Again', 'horrible', 'DVD', 'blame', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'are', 'next', 'know', 'decent', 'special', 'features', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'extended', 'edition', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'shame', 'shame']",Green Lantern

1403720,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B004EPZ07K,V. Berk,"[3, 6]","Green Lantern seems doomed to be perhaps the biggest box office disappointment of 2011.  I know during the months leading up to it I was incredibly excited to see where it went, and the trailers did not disappoint.  So, where did the film go wrong exactly?  An estimated budget of roughly $200 million, a lot of hype leading up to it, a cast of likable actors, the talent of proven action director Martin Campbell (GoldenEye, Casino Royale, The Mask of Zorro), a superhero whose universe is rich with mythology of its own creation - what could possibly go wrong?  Well, a lot actually, as the box office returns, and harsh critical response has proven.Once the movie started I quickly cought onto the first strike against Green Lantern.  The script of Green Lantern is founded on conventional superhero movies clich&eacute;s and offers very little variation.  If you've seen any superhero films of the last thirty years you've already seen Green Lantern.  Green Lantern as a comic-adaptation has one thing that could possibly help it from being just another superhero movie and that's the mythology.  Aliens, an intergalactic peace corps- this is good stuff that could have made a far superior movie.  What we do see of the Green Lantern Corps and the world of Oa really is the best the movie offers, and sadly are likely only 10% of the actual running time.  From the trailers I was really expecting this film to explore this intergalactic, multi-species group of heroes, with Hal Jordan being the audience's guide and voice through the experience.  One scene where all the different races are shown united together is one of the most striking, visually spectacular moments of the film!Sadly, that is not the case.  Hal goes to Oa, is briefly trained for all of five minutes, decides he isn't good enough, and then sails back to Earth for the duration of the film (except for a brief period at the end).  What I wanted to see the most from the movie the filmmakers ultimately failed to deliver.Ryan Reynolds is likable enough as Hal Jordan, but is burdened by a forced romance between him and Blake Lively's character.  To be fair, Lively's acting isn't as bad by most action movie standards, but her character is just poorly written.  I know I'll sound repetitive, but once again the best comes from Oa and the Lantern Corps with Mark Strong as Sinestro, Geoffrey Rush as Tomar-Re, and Michael Clarke Duncan as Kilowag who steal the movie during all their scenes.  Their characters aren't complex, but they wind up leaving a far greater impact on the audience and make one wish they could have gotten far more than the minimal screen time they ultimately received in the film.But what is a superhero film without a super villain?  Well, here comes another disappointment.  The antagonists of the film are Parallax, a giant octopus-like entity that consumes fear in individuals and can decimate entire worlds, and a human intellectual with daddy issues named Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard), who is corrupted by Parallax's yellow energy.  Aside from the issue of trying to cram two super villains into a movie where the hero's origin story is the primary focus, both of these antagonists have huge problems.Let's start with our primary antagonist, Parallax; the giant head/space-octopus who is responsible for the extinction of many worlds and the death of Green Lantern Abin Sur.  Many have criticized the film stating that Parallax simply looks silly, but that honestly isn't my primary complaint with the character.  My complaint is that in a fictional universe with thousands of Green Lanterns they have to have the giant, planet consuming villain be the one to fight one-on-one with new Lantern Hal Jordan.  Wouldn't this villain have been far more effective if they'd saved him for a sequel where the entire Corps could ban together?  It just doesn't seem fitting for a single member to be fighting something like this, not to mention it isn't as exciting to look at one film because there's really no way to coordinate an action sequence between a giant, planet sized yellow smoke-octopus and a single man.Oh, and then there's Peter Sarsgaard.  I love Sarsgaard in this movie, but not at all for the reason the movie would like.  It seems unlikely that the script intended this, but Sarsgaard has created one of the most hilarious characters to appear in a superhero movie I've ever seen- and he's supposed to be the antagonist.  The script clearly wants him to be a fleshed out villain acting out of his feelings of inadequacy, but Sarsgaard is so over-the-top and downright goofy he comes across as a cartoon character who would be more at home in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" than an action movie.  Every scene he awkwardly speaks his lines in a silly manner that leaves the audience snickering and during the action scenes he screams in ways that would no doubt make Sam Raimi proud if he were to cast Sarsgaard in an Evil Dead film.On top of all other issues the film is dreadfully edited and cut down from what was obviously intended to be a much longer film.  Rumor has it that 20 to 40 minutes of Martin Campbell's initial cut were removed to achieve a runtime of less than two hours.  This is just a painfully obvious fact that the film constantly reminds you of!  Characters appear in random places without any explanation!  Clearly the character and dialogue scenes have been cut to make most of the film action scenes, but without any context the audience doesn't care.  The blatantly cut out transitions and exposition above all else are what really kills Green Lantern.In the end, I am going to give the extended cut of this film a watch when it comes out on Blu-Ray/DVD.  Many of the problems will likely remain, such as cheesy dialogue, the fairly generic superhero plot, and of course Sarsgaard's off-key performance, but there's no doubt that some actual transitions and character development would be a vast improvement - or, so I hope.Green Lantern isn't as bad as some other summer blockbusters you could go see (I'd much rather sit through Green Lantern over any of Michael Bay's Transformers films) but as it is the film is bland, and brings nothing new to the table.  Whether they make a sequel or a reboot I do hope they choose to concentrate more on the mythology and the actual Green Lantern Corps, because that really is the more interesting aspect of this

I was there at the midnight opening, with merely a few others, I thought that was a bad sign because Thor/X-Men were pretty full for their midnight releases. After the movie, me and my friends agreed it was decent and definitely not as bad as the critics made it out to be. I actually ended up seeing it twice throughout it's theatrical run and enjoyed it quite a bit more the second time. When I heard the Blu-Ray was going to have an Extended Cut I was really happy. I was thinking ""It just needed more Oa/Sinestro scenes!"" Unfortunately, the EC doesn't have any of that. In the EC it includes scenes of Hal's childhood, and little bit more of an extended scene with Hal and his nephew at his birthday party. Surprisingly, it helps out the first act of the film quite a bit. In fact, I was watching it with my brother and he said to me, ""when does the movie start to suck again?"" After watching it quite a few times, I can honestly say I enjoyed GL. It does have its obvious flaws, but you can still enjoy it. I think why fans are so hard on it is because we know what GL could have been. Does ""Space-Opera"" and ""Star Wars of Comic Book Movies"" sound familiar? Yeah.Now I was kinda letdown with the score, it does have some decent spots, but overall it was fairly average. The complete CGI suit looked decent at best. I think they should have been more practical and had Ryan Reynolds wear a real suit and added some CGI to it, so it still feels like a living thing or give it that ""alienistic"" feel they were going for.Now I think the cast was pretty great for the most part, mainly Ryan Reynolds. The only thing that really bugged me was Hector's ""mating call"" scream. I'm sorry, but it was kinda funny.Still, it seems to be selling well on BR. Despite it's somewhat of a flop at the B.O. it seems people may have been holding out for this one to hit DVD/BR and get it instead of seeing it at the cinema.

So I set it on a shelf and didn't watch it until yesterday, more than a year later. I was pleased to find that I didn't think the movie was nearly as bad as many of the reviews I had read indicated. Certainly there are weak spots, in my opinion, the ending (vanquishing the villian) probably at the top of that list. However, this was an origin story and as such had a lot of ground to cover.

Still, ""Green Lantern"" is entertaining and Ryan Reynolds brings his characteristic charm and humor to the role.We get both the theatrical cut and the extended edition which includes more background on Hal Jordan's childhood and the death of his father.

And I was right. From beginning to end Green Lantern is a special effects extravaganza and an entertaining origin story. I generally do not care for origin stories because being familiar with a superhero character means I already know the story and would rather see something new. With Green Lantern we really have the best of both worlds. The movie does not delay in placing the ring of power on the finger of Hal Jordan. From there we watch as Hal struggles to meet the burden placed upon him while the Earth is threatened by Parallax one of the Guardians of Oa that has turned evil.There is good character development with Hal who is depicted as being a womanizing cocky and brash pilot to a responsible superhero. The CGI is top notch and the depiction of Oa, the guardians and many of the other aliens that are a part of the intergalactic Green Lantern Corps rivals the special effects seen in the more recent Star Wars prequels. The relationship between Hal and Dr. Hector Hammond, who is infected with the yellow power of Parallax, could have been better fleshed out and brought to more depth. The same could be said with Hal's relationship with Carol Farris. There seems to be little justification for the affection between the two given the characterization of their earlier antagonism toward one another.Parallax has a habit of easily defeating the other Green Lanterns in the Corps and after the Guardians of Oa refuse to help him, with the encouragement of Sinestro a future supervillian, Hal faces the Corps most notorious villain alone.  I won't give away the ending and although origin stories can be predictable, as this one certainly is, the story is told in a manner which is exciting and entertaining. I am unabashedly a CGI junkie and this movie delivers on that account. Therefore combined with a story that is pretty riveting despite its predictability along with great eye candy The Green Lantern is a good introduction for this underdog and little known superhero.",5,Lived up to the Hype for Me!!!,1319500800,"10 25, 2011",2011,2126,"['Reviews', 'were', 'mixed', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'trailers', 'viewed', 'indicated', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'would', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'was', 'right', 'beginning', 'end', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'special', 'effects', 'extravaganza', 'entertaining', 'origin', 'story', 'generally', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'origin', 'stories', 'being', 'familiar', 'superhero', 'character', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'something', 'new', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'really', 'have', 'best', 'worlds', 'movie', 'not', 'delay', 'placing', 'ring', 'power', 'finger', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'watch', 'Hal', 'meet', 'burden', 'placed', 'Earth', 'threatened', 'Parallax', 'one', 'Guardians', 'Oa', 'turned', 'evil.There', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'Hal', 'who', 'depicted', 'being', 'womanizing', 'cocky', 'brash', 'pilot', 'responsible', 'superhero', 'CGI', 'top', 'notch', 'depiction', 'Oa', 'guardians', 'many', 'other', 'aliens', 'are', 'part', 'intergalactic', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Corps', 'special', 'effects', 'seen', 'more', 'recent', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequels', 'relationship', 'Hal', 'Dr.', 'Hector', 'Hammond', 'who', 'infected', 'yellow', 'power', 'Parallax', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'fleshed', 'out', 'brought', 'more', 'depth', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Hal', 'relationship', 'Carol', 'Farris', 'be', 'little', 'justification', 'affection', 'two', 'given', 'characterization', 'earlier', 'antagonism', 'one', 'another.Parallax', 'habit', 'easily', 'defeating', 'other', 'Green', 'Lanterns', 'Corps', 'Guardians', 'Oa', 'refuse', 'help', 'encouragement', 'Sinestro', 'future', 'supervillian', 'Hal', 'Corps', 'most', 'notorious', 'villain', 'alone', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'origin', 'stories', 'can', 'be', 'predictable', 'one', 'certainly', 'story', 'told', 'manner', 'exciting', 'entertaining', 'am', 'unabashedly', 'CGI', 'junkie', 'movie', 'account', 'Therefore', 'combined', 'story', 'pretty', 'riveting', 'predictability', 'great', 'eye', 'candy', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'good', 'introduction', 'underdog', 'little', 'known', 'superhero']",Green Lantern
1403731,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B004EPZ07K,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[3, 6]","Given some of the superhero movies that have come out lately, the best news about Green Lantern is that the studio, Warner Brothers, did _not_ go with their original idea of casting Jack Black as Hal Jordan (unlike Columbia Pictures who _did_ cast Seth Rogen as Britt Reid in The Green Hornet, condemning it to be The Green Bomb of superhero flicks).  Ryan Reynolds is actually fairly decent as the title hero, and while the movie did come up short in a number of ways, it wasn't for any failing on Reynolds' part.For anyone already familiar with the Green Lantern comics which go back for decades, no real synopsis is needed, but for everyone else here's the basic plot: Unknown to humanity, who only recently have begun to venture out into space, there is an ancient organization called the Green Lantern Corps, established by a race known as the Guardians of the Universe, to act as a kind of inter-galactic police force, with one Green Lantern assigned to each of the 3,600 sectors that make up the known universe. Each Green Lantern is armed with a ring of power that allows them to create whatever they need out of a kind of mystical green energy, the only limits being that of their imagination and their will. A battle with a deadly entity known as Parallax (voiced by Clancy Brown) leaves the Green Lantern for our sector, Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison), mortally wounded. Crash-landing on Earth, the dying Sur commands his ring to find a worthy successor among the inhabitants of Earth to take his place.  The ring, as fate would have it, finds Hal Jordan (Reynolds), a cocky if irresponsible and impulsive test pilot. The transition is made and Jordan becomes the new Green Lantern, only to be faced with opposition from Sinestro (Mark Strong), the current leader of the GL Corps who regards him as unfit to be the new GL.  Jordan has his own doubts about his fitness, but they quickly become immaterial as Earth is faced with twin threats: the entity Parallax and a human scientist, Hector Hammond (marvelously played by Peter Sarsgaard) who is accidentally infected with some of Parallax's essence, which causes him to mutate, disfiguring and crippling him but giving him extraordinary mental powers including telepathy and telekinesis. Alone and unsure of himself, Jordan must nonetheless use the power given him to save both the Earth and his love interest, Carol Ferris (Blake Lively).  Or die trying.As a film, Green Lantern is somewhat uneven, mainly due to the script and to a lesser degree some questionable casting.  Too much of the script consists of lumps of exposition, making it hard for the film to build up momentum and causing parts of it to drag unnecessarily. It also spreads itself too thin, bringing in characters from the Green Lantern comic lore like Tomar-Re (Geoffrey Rush) and Kilowog (Michael Clarke Duncan), two alien GL's, and Amanda Waller (Angela Bassett), head of a secret government science/security agency, but giving them minimal screen time and little to do.  And the choice of villains is highly questionable. Hector Hammond is hardly the most memorable GL villain from the comics and in this incarnation is rendered more disfigured than truly powerful, and Parallax is done here more like a creature out of an H.L. Lovecraft story than anything else, consisting entirely of special effects with Clancy Brown's voice behind them.(This is one of my frequent complaints about movies in recent years:  special effects do _not_ make up for a lame script.  Neither does doing the film in 3D.  Green Lantern cost some $150M to make.  They'd have been better off spending more money getting the script right than on trying to cover its deficiencies up with special effects and 3D.)And as I mentioned, some of the casting was unfortunate. Tim Robbins as Senator Hammond, Hector's over-bearing father, is utterly wasted and out of place, most of the time looking like he's wondering how he got stuck in the role and how soon he can get out of it.  Angela Bassett is not only wasted, she's just simply _wrong_ as Amanda Waller as anyone familiar with the character from the comics can attest to.  And with Blake Lively, who's not remotely believable as a test pilot, there's a complete lack of chemistry between her and Reynolds. To be fair though, all of these people are fine actors who have been remarkable in any number of other movies; they were simply badly cast here and hampered with banal dialogue that would've tested any actor.But which leads me to mention the two stand-outs of Green Lantern. Mark Strong is quite convincing as Sinestro, GL's classic nemesis from the comics, though here he's in pre-villain mode and so can't take center stage.  Nonetheless, in the scenes he does have, Strong can do more with a withering glance than most actors can with a page of dialogue. But it's Peter Sarsgaard's Hector Hammond who really steals the show (not to mention every scene he's in). More than any other actor in the film, Sarsgaard seems to really get what comic superheroes and supervillains are all about. And he plays Hammond to the hilt, even hampered by the script and by a make-up job that is more Elephant Man than the villain from the original comics, reaching the audience on a level that no one else in the film does. You _get_ Hammond, even if you wouldn't want to be in the same room with him. And, it has to be said, Sarsgaard brings to the table the best (and creepiest) supervillain / evil-scientist laugh I've heard in years.The special effects, particularly the ring effects which are absolutely vital to making Green Lantern come alive, are fairly well done.  I wasn't blown away by them, but neither was I left feeling let down by them.  The same for the alien Green Lanterns and the Guardians of the Universe.  Not the best they could have been, but they work. With one exception: the attempts to make Hal Jordan's eyes green when he becomes the Green Lantern never quite pull it off.Oh, and make sure you watch the movie through the end credits: there's a scene with Sinestro that sets things up for what will almost certainly be the sequel, if GL has a respectable box office anyway.Overall, I'd recommend Green Lantern as a decent watch if you're a fan of the comic or of superhero films in general.",3,A decent Green Lantern but could have been better,1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,6269,"['Given', 'superhero', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'out',

I just wasn't sold on Ryan Reynolds being the Green Lantern, nothing the hero did really 'qualified' him to be a ring bearer. In fact, probably the most interesting character was Sinestro and he's only in a few scenes. There were also a few plot inconsistencies which were very blatant.  For instance...Why does Hal Jordan fly back to the lantern homeworld, to ask them to fight for Earth, get rejected, and then say fine let me be the one to fight for Earth by myself. Instead of wasting time flying back he should have went to fight Parallax and be done with it.Also, the over use of CG was ridiculous, to the point that I got annoyed everytime Hal put on the green mask. It looked so damn fake, everything about it looked awful. The CG for the homeworld was pretty and some of the lantern stuff was cool, but holy crap, the suits looked terrible.

Collecting and following the DC Comic Book Superhero character for years with all its rich history was maybe part of the reason for a negative reaction to the film because expectations were so high. When the release of the Blu-Ray/DVD for GREEN LANTERN in October was approaching, this reviewer was not going to even purchase it because of the initial screening. However, this reviewer relented and even bought the Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Package because of the extended director's cut. Well, seeing the film again, this reviewer found the movie entertaining and not as bad as was remembered from the June big screen premier. Perhaps the film works better on the small screen than on the big screen (and without the annoying 3-D glasses and without a bunch of noisy teenagers in the theater yelling at the screen). This reviewer found a few positive points for the film. Ryan Reynolds does a decent job as Hal Jordan/Green Lantern as does the rest of the cast. The movie worked well when the film shifted to the Green Lantern Corps home planet on OA. However, the scenes on Earth are somewhat clunky. The creators had a chance to make a great space opra film with the Green Lantern Corps being a sort of Jedi Knights equivalent (The Green Lantern Corps were created years before Jedi Knights), but maybe the sequel (hopefully) will address that.

Sure it was animated, but in that one you didn't have Hal Jordan whining about his dead father and how he feels like he can't handle being a Green Lantern.  In this movie Hal Jordan, the one person on Earth who is supposed to be confident, fearless, and in control, is NONE of those things.  He's an adult who whines like an emo 14 yr old.  ""Oh my dad's dead, wah!  Oh my girlfriend won't go out with me anymore, wah!  Oh, I lost my job, wah! Oh, I was in a life and death situation yesterday and I got scared, wah!""The whole time I was shifting in my seat, checking my phone, reading the newspaper, etc.  I didn't care!  Look, I read comic books.  I'll admit that right now.  And not EVERY character needs to be dark and brooding with daddy issues.  Seriously, we did that crap in the 90's with every single character, it only worked for like 3 characters, the rest were just crap.  It didn't work then, and it sure as hell doesn't work now.  I didn't buy this movie to watch some whiny emo brooding 20-something complaining about his life.  I bought this movie cuz I wanted to see Ryan Reynolds get a ring that lets him fly through space, shoot energy blasts, make energy constructs, talk to aliens, travel to other planets and fight Parallax.Honestly, if you're just interested in the things I just mentioned, fast forward past everything until you see Hal running up to Abin Suir's crashed space ship.  Say what you will about ""First Flight,"" but in that movie it only took 2 minutes to do what it took the live action movie 20 minutes to do!  Establish Hal getting the ring and friggin' using it!When they FINALLY get to Oa, we get some action at last!  The portrayal of Sinestro was PERFECT!  Seriously, it could not have been done better in any way shape or form.  But Kilowog.  Oh god what happened?  At the end of the movie Kilowog says ""Can I train 'em or can I train 'em?""  Ummm, 'Wog, you didn't train Hal at all, you just kicked his ass for like 2 minutes and insulted him the whole time about how he wasn't ready to be a lantern and then you left.  Sure at the end he uses the whole, ""The bigger you are the faster you burn"" thing, which is an off handed comment that Kilowog made during their ""training session.""Trying to take credit for that is like if you were watching a boxing match and halfway through the fight you shouted out, ""Hit him really hard!""  And the boxer won the fight.  Then you turned to you buddy and said, ""Yeah, I told him to do that.""Kilowog LOOKED awesome, the voice was good, and he had ONE good line.  ""Welcome to ring-slingin' 101, or as I like to call it the worst day of your miserable life.""  That was the only good part of Kilowog's entire appearance in this movie.Later Hal is moping around his apartment crying about how he can't be a Green Lantern and that he doesn't want to be a Green Lantern, and that it's too much responsibility for him.  Oh god, I hear enough of this crap in my everyday life, I didn't pay $24.95 to hear this crap.  Get to the friggin' action!  And then in the VERY NEXT SCENE suddenly he grows a pair and races off to Oa to say, ""We MUST stop Paralax and if you don't help me, I'll do it myself!""  Ummm, did we miss something?  How did he go from being the whiny emo punk with daddy issues to being John McClane with a power ring in like 15 seconds?  Seriously, I feel like there's like 2 or 3 scenes missing between those 2 scenes.I won't go into how lame the climax between Hal and Paralax is, but let's just say it's a BIG disappointment.I know this movie was garbage and was just setting up for the sequel, but I hope that the next one will be better and they'll get it right next time.  But do NOT pay full price for this.  If anything go rent this from the Redbox or have a friend burn you a copy.FAIL!!!",2,Just Plain Bad,1319846400,"10 29, 2011",2011,4006,"['Okay', 'know', 'everyone', 'up', 'arms', 'digital', 'copy', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'am', 'going', 'talk', 'am', 'going', 'review', 'just', 'movie', 'itself.First', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'First', 'Flight', 'was', 'better', 'Sure', 'was', 'animated', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'whining', 'dead', 'father', 'how', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'being', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'movie', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'one', 'person', 'Earth', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'confident', 'fearless', 'control', 'NONE', 'things', 'adult', 'who', 'emo', '14', 'yr', 'old', 'Oh', 'dad', 'dead', 'wah', 'Oh', 'girlfriend', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'anymore', 'wah', 'Oh', 'lost', 'job', 'wah', 'Oh', 'was', 'life', 'death', 'situation', 'yesterday', 'got', 'scared', 'wah', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'shifting', 'seat', 'checking', 'phone', 'reading', 'newspaper', 'etc', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Look', 'read', 'comic', 'books', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'right', 'now', 'not', 'EVERY', 'character', 'needs', 'be', 'dark', 'brooding', 'daddy', 'issues', 'Seriously', 'did', 'crap', '90', 'single', 'character', 'only', 'worked', '3', 'characters', 'rest', 'were', 'just', 'crap', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'then', 'sure', 'hell', ""n't"", 'work', 'now', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movie', 'watch', 'whiny', 'emo', 'brooding', '20-something', 'complaining', 'life', 'bought', 'movie', 'cuz', 'wanted', 'see', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'get', 'ring', 'fly', 'space', 'shoot', 'energy', 'blasts', 'make', 'energy', 'constructs', 'talk', 'aliens', 'travel', 'other', 'planets', 'fight', 'Parallax.Honestly', ""'re"", 'just', 'interested', 'things', 'just', 'mentioned', 'fast', 'forward', 'everything', 'see', 'Hal', 'running', 'up', 'Abin', 'Suir', 'crashed', 'space', 'ship', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'First', 'Flight', 'movie', 'only', 'took', '2', 'minutes', 'do', 'what', 'took', 'live', 'action', 'movie', '20', 'minutes', 'do', 'Establish', 'Hal', 'getting', 'ring', 'friggin', 'using', 'When', 'FINALLY', 'get', 'Oa', 'get', 'action', 'last', 'portrayal', 'Sinestro', 'was', 'PERFECT', 'Seriously', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'Kilowog', 'Oh', 'god', 'what', 'happened', 'end', 'movie', 'Kilowog', 'Can', 'train', 'can', 'train', 'Ummm', ""'Wog"", 'did', ""n't"", 'train', 'Hal', 'just', 'kicked', 'ass', '2', 'minutes', 'insulted', 'whole', 'time', 'how', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'be', 'lantern', 'then', 'left', 'Sure', 'end', 'whole', 'bigger', 'are', 'faster', 'burn', 'thing', 'off', 'handed', 'comment', 'Kilowog', 'made', 'training', 'session', 'Trying', 'take', 'credit', 'were', 'watching', 'boxing', 'match', 'halfway', 'fight', 'shouted', 'out', 'Hit', 'really', 'hard', 'boxer', 'won', 'fight', 'Then', 'turned', 'buddy', 'said', 'Yeah', 'told', 'do', 'Kilowog', 'LOOKED', 'awesome', 'voice', 'was', 'good', 'had', 'ONE', 'good', 'line', 'Welcome', 'ring-slingin', '101', 'like', 'call', 'worst', 'day', 'miserable', 'life', 'was', 'only', 'good', 'part', 'Kilowog', 'entire', 'appearance', 'movie.Later', 'Hal', 'moping', 'apartment', 'crying', 'how', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'Green', 'Lantern', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'too', 'much', 'responsibility', 'Oh', 'god', 'hear', 'enough', 'crap', 'everyday', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', '24.95', 'hear', 'crap', 'Get', 'friggin', 'action', 'then', 'VERY', 'NEXT', 'SCENE', 'suddenly', 'pair', 'races', 'off', 'Oa', 'say', 'MUST', 'stop', 'Paralax', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', ""'ll"", 'do', 'Ummm', 'did', 'miss', 'something', 'How', 'did', 'go', 'being', 'whiny', 'punk', 'daddy', 'issues', 'being', 'John', 'McClane', 'power', 'ring', '15', 'seconds', 'Seriously', 'feel', '2', '3', 'scenes', 'missing', '2', 'scenes.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'how', 'lame', 'climax', 'Hal', 'Paralax', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'BIG', 'disappointment.I', 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'garbage', 'was', 'just', 'setting', 'up', 'sequel', 'hope', 'next', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'better', ""'ll"", 'get', 'right', 'next', 'time', 'do', 'NOT', 'pay', 'full', 'price', 'anything', 'go', 'rent', 'Redbox', 'have', 'friend', 'burn', 'copy.FAIL']",Green Lantern
