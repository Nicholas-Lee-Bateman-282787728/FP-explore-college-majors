1447522,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B0058YPO9A,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[35, 36]","When I was a kid, anyone who got cancer was usually dead a few months later.  Flash forward to 2011 and I know many people in stage four cancers who are lasting year after year.  I am five years past colon cancer 2A so I am familiar with the whole current routine.This show picks up where cancer is today.  It is a much longer event and one must live a life while also carrying around this disease for who knows how long.  Laura Linney as the cancer patient continues her excellent job from season one.One distinct improvement this season is that her oncologist was replaced by an actor who is doing a more believable job.  This is Alan Alda. Alda always brings interesting juxtapositions to his roles.  He is able to play a competent professional doing his job yet also turn the role on its head by being a smarmy fool married to a much younger woman.Likewise, Kathy has a friend now also in her clinical trial and he is a valuable addition to the show.  He has had cancer a lot longer that Kathy.  This is not his first clinical trial. He covers a gamut of emotions far more advanced than Kathy's.  While she is still in strong survival mode, focused solely on beating cancer, he is not so sure he wants to continue the battle.  The knowledge has set in that he cannot beat it; he can only forestall it.  Additionally, they are both stage fours so they face constant chemo (or similar) or they will die. This strong piece of acting is done by Brit actor Hugh Dancy who is totally believable as an American cancer patient.I've noticed that more and more shows bill themselves as comedies.  This one also does so, with the tag line, ""A suburban mom, diagnosed with cancer, tries to find the humor in the disease.""  I do not find this an accurate depiction of this show. Although there are comedic moments, there are far many more dramatic moments.I will take issue with only one thing that I think is wrong about this show in depicting cancer.  When Kathy is getting chemo, she looks far too healthy.  People who are getting chemo have a certain grayness to them, a sickly pallor.  This is because poison is being pumped into their veins.  Kathy looks radiant, by contrast. Hugh Dancy, playing her cancer buddy in the clinical trial, actually looks like someone going through chemo.  I don't know why this wasn't done to both actors.If I were not a cancer patient, I might give this series four stars instead of five.  However, it is the most germane piece of tv work I've seen relative to my own illness so for me personally it is worth the five stars.",5,Cancer Continues--Mirroring Real Life,1316304000,"09 18, 2011",2011,2553,"['When', 'was', 'kid', 'anyone', 'who', 'got', 'cancer', 'was', 'usually', 'dead', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'Flash', 'forward', '2011', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'stage', 'four', 'cancers', 'who', 'are', 'lasting', 'year', 'year', 'am', 'five', 'years', 'past', 'colon', 'cancer', '2A', 'so', 'am', 'familiar', 'whole', 'current', 'routine.This', 'show', 'up', 'where', 'cancer', 'today', 'much', 'longer', 'event', 'one', 'must', 'live', 'life', 'also', 'carrying', 'disease', 'who', 'how', 'long', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'cancer', 'patient', 'excellent', 'job', 'season', 'one.One', 'distinct', 'improvement', 'season', 'oncologist', 'was', 'replaced', 'actor', 'who', 'doing', 'more', 'believable', 'job', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'Alda', 'always', 'interesting', 'juxtapositions', 'roles', 'able', 'play', 'competent', 'professional', 'doing', 'job', 'yet', 'also', 'turn', 'role', 'head', 'being', 'smarmy', 'fool', 'married', 'much', 'younger', 'woman.Likewise', 'Kathy', 'friend', 'now', 'also', 'clinical', 'trial', 'valuable', 'addition', 'show', 'had', 'cancer', 'lot', 'longer', 'Kathy', 'not', 'first', 'clinical', 'trial', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'far', 'more', 'advanced', 'Kathy', 'still', 'strong', 'survival', 'mode', 'focused', 'solely', 'beating', 'cancer', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'continue', 'battle', 'knowledge', 'set', 'can', 'not', 'beat', 'can', 'only', 'forestall', 'Additionally', 'are', 'stage', 'fours', 'face', 'constant', 'chemo', 'similar', 'will', 'die', 'strong', 'piece', 'acting', 'done', 'Brit', 'actor', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'who', 'totally', 'believable', 'American', 'cancer', 'patient.I', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'more', 'more', 'shows', 'bill', 'comedies', 'one', 'also', 'so', 'tag', 'line', 'suburban', 'mom', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'tries', 'find', 'humor', 'disease', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'show', 'are', 'comedic', 'moments', 'are', 'far', 'many', 'more', 'dramatic', 'moments.I', 'will', 'take', 'issue', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'think', 'wrong', 'show', 'depicting', 'cancer', 'When', 'Kathy', 'getting', 'chemo', 'far', 'too', 'healthy', 'People', 'who', 'are', 'getting', 'chemo', 'have', 'certain', 'grayness', 'sickly', 'pallor', 'poison', 'being', 'pumped', 'veins', 'Kathy', 'radiant', 'contrast', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'playing', 'cancer', 'buddy', 'clinical', 'trial', 'actually', 'someone', 'going', 'chemo', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'actors.If', 'were', 'not', 'cancer', 'patient', 'might', 'give', 'series', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'However', 'most', 'germane', 'piece', 'tv', 'work', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'relative', 'own', 'illness', 'so', 'personally', 'five', 'stars']",The Big C: Season 2

Cathy does border on the eccentric, but I guess it runs in the family since her brother is 'out there' as well.I won't spoil any story lines, but we start to see that characters come and go in Cathy's life.

It's a fabulous portrayal of the vast array of emotions a terminal cancer patient goes through on their way through what's left of their life - without being at all depressing.  There's a lot of 'comedy', if you will - and poignant moments that will leave you re-evaluating your own day-to-day living skills long after the episode has ended.  This is an excellent 'ice-breaker' for families and friends of cancer patients to watch together, to kind of open up dialogue on many difficult to broach subjects.  Some of the best acting on television, hands down.",5,Just finished season 2,1370044800,"06 1, 2013",2013,577,"['love', 'show', 'fabulous', 'portrayal', 'vast', 'array', 'emotions', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'patient', 'way', 'what', 'left', 'life', 'being', 'depressing', 'lot', ""'comedy"", 'will', 'poignant', 'moments', 'will', 'leave', 're-evaluating', 'own', 'day-to-day', 'living', 'skills', 'long', 'episode', 'ended', 'excellent', ""'ice-breaker"", 'families', 'friends', 'cancer', 'patients', 'watch', 'together', 'kind', 'open', 'up', 'dialogue', 'many', 'difficult', 'broach', 'subjects', 'best', 'acting', 'television', 'down']",The Big C: Season 2
