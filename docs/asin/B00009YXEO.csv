It was about ppl in particular inwhich this movie portrays very well, it doesnt matter if these ppl were in Atlantic city.  Notice that most of the negative reviews only point out what the movie isnt about, geesh! one can only feel that maybe these viewers are mad because they werent in the movie are no one showed their neighborhood. lol  Anyway, moving on to the movie itself, O'donnell gives a superb and somewhat comedic performance as a bad guy hitman who runs with the money, Michael Rappaport plays a crooked cop whos out for a little reward of his own when he comes across the other characters and their struggle for possession of the money.  Jeremy does a good job with playing the innocent guy role as well as cook playing a valley girl gone bad, and Bill pullman as a goofy weird clerk at a bus station.  This movie does what pulp fiction didnt and thats keep the pace with all of its characters and how they interact and cross each other paths.  I also like the Indians in this movie and their whole buy back the land casino gig.  I won't go into detail about the movie because Im not into spoilers but to be brief this is a movie revolving around a bag full of money, and what ppl will do to get their hands on it.  Great acting, good plot I would reccomend this movie to anyone who wants to see something that doesnt drag in the wind.....................nuff said!",5,Better than pulp fiction,1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,1496,"['What', 'bunch', 'cry', 'baby', 'idiots', 'one', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'ppl', '29', 'palms', '29', 'palms', 'general', 'was', 'about', 'ppl', 'particular', 'inwhich', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'matter', 'ppl', 'were', 'Atlantic', 'city', 'Notice', 'most', 'negative', 'reviews', 'only', 'point', 'out', 'what', 'movie', 'isnt', 'geesh', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'feel', 'maybe', 'viewers', 'are', 'mad', 'werent', 'movie', 'are', 'one', 'showed', 'neighborhood', 'lol', 'Anyway', 'moving', 'movie', ""O'donnell"", 'superb', 'somewhat', 'comedic', 'performance', 'bad', 'guy', 'hitman', 'who', 'money', 'Michael', 'Rappaport', 'crooked', 'cop', 'out', 'little', 'reward', 'own', 'when', 'other', 'characters', 'struggle', 'possession', 'money', 'Jeremy', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'innocent', 'guy', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'cook', 'playing', 'valley', 'girl', 'gone', 'bad', 'Bill', 'pullman', 'goofy', 'weird', 'clerk', 'bus', 'station', 'movie', 'what', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'didnt', 'thats', 'keep', 'pace', 'characters', 'how', 'interact', 'cross', 'other', 'paths', 'also', 'Indians', 'movie', 'whole', 'buy', 'back', 'land', 'casino', 'gig', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'movie', 'Im', 'not', 'spoilers', 'be', 'brief', 'movie', 'revolving', 'bag', 'full', 'money', 'what', 'ppl', 'will', 'do', 'get', 'hands', 'Great', 'acting', 'good', 'plot', 'would', 'reccomend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'something', 'drag', 'wind', 'nuff', 'said']",N/A
759940,A1CK1RZ1M4JM7K,B00009YXEO,"Laurie ""moviemailer""","[1, 1]","29 Palms is a good movie worth renting or buying.29 Palms is a thrill-packed action suspense mystery filled with a good cast that includes: Bill Pullman,Chris O'Donnell,Michael Rapaport,Keith David,Michael Lerner, Rachel Leigh Cook,Jeremy Davie and Jon Polito. The main thing in this movie is that the main character doesn't know who to trust after he comes home to find his girlfriend being killed so he is on the run after he was the target of a hitman due to their belief that he is an undercover FBI agent. The only flaw in the film is that they don't state whether he was an undercover agent or not-perhaps this doesn't matter.This may be better to purchase or rent on dvd as the extra features could explain that question. There is not always a motive or reason so that could be the answer to that question but why was this particular man the subject of a hitman ? Why did the hitman record the verbal transaction asking for the proof of the hit when he picked up the bag of money ?Everything revolves around the hitman's stolen-then lost bag of money that has been reproduced into several identical bags that rotate around fooling everyone-except the one who planted the extra bags.The money is for the hit on the man who ran after finding his girlfriend murdered. We never know the main character's name as it's listed in the credits as ""the drifter"" played by Jeremy Davies. Bill Pullman as the bus station manager. Keith David as the local sheriff. Michael Rapaport is as a corrupt policeman.Joe Polito is good as a horny security guard.Chris O'Donnell as an FBI agent hitman.Michael Lerner as the guy who orders the hit.Rachel Leigh Cook is good as the girl on the side of the road who's car is broken down.There are Native Americans in this as well who give good performances.This is a recommended thriller-mystery.It would get 5 stars but it is good but not excellent.",4,29 Palms-Thriller Mystery Action Suspense  with a Good Cast,1061424000,"08 21, 2003",2003,1881,"['29', 'Palms', 'good', 'movie', 'renting', 'buying.29', 'Palms', 'thrill-packed', 'action', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'filled', 'good', 'cast', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'Michael', 'Rapaport', 'Keith', 'David', 'Michael', 'Lerner', 'Rachel', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'Jeremy', 'Davie', 'Jon', 'Polito', 'main', 'thing', 'movie', 'main', 'character', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'trust', 'home', 'find', 'girlfriend', 'being', 'killed', 'so', 'run', 'was', 'target', 'hitman', 'due', 'belief', 'undercover', 'FBI', 'agent', 'only', 'flaw', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'state', 'was', 'undercover', 'agent', 'not-perhaps', ""n't"", 'matter.This', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'purchase', 'rent', 'dvd', 'extra', 'features', 'could', 'explain', 'question', 'not', 'always', 'motive', 'reason', 'could', 'be', 'answer', 'question', 'why', 'was', 'particular', 'man', 'subject', 'hitman', 'Why', 'did', 'hitman', 'record', 'verbal', 'transaction', 'asking', 'proof', 'hit', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'bag', 'money', 'Everything', 'revolves', 'hitman', 'stolen-then', 'lost', 'bag', 'money', 'been', 'reproduced', 'several', 'identical', 'bags', 'rotate', 'fooling', 'everyone-except', 'one', 'who', 'planted', 'extra', 'bags.The', 'money', 'hit', 'man', 'who', 'ran', 'finding', 'girlfriend', 'murdered', 'never', 'know', 'main', 'character', 'name', 'listed', 'credits', 'drifter', 'played', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'bus', 'station', 'manager', 'Keith', 'David', 'local', 'sheriff', 'Michael', 'Rapaport', 'corrupt', 'policeman.Joe', 'Polito', 'good', 'horny', 'security', 'guard.Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'FBI', 'agent', 'hitman.Michael', 'Lerner', 'guy', 'who', 'orders', 'hit.Rachel', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'good', 'girl', 'side', 'road', 'who', 'car', 'broken', 'are', 'Native', 'Americans', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'give', 'good', 'performances.This', 'recommended', 'thriller-mystery.It', 'would', 'get', '5', 'stars', 'good', 'not', 'excellent']",N/A

I liked that it used a take on the Indian Casinos, which are all the rage here. I like Jeremy Davis and he has a cool subtleness in the way he performs, very sensitive and creating a depth to his character. I liked O'Donnell who plays against his cast type and does a good job, he really looks the part. My favorite was Bill Pullman, that guy can really act tripped out. I think he acts really freaky in this film and I liked that. I wish he had more scenes. Rappaport who is also good is in the film. I like him, its seems like he can play a cop good in any film. The other characters were over the top and I couldn't get into them, except Cook who plays her character pretty straight. I loved the ending, that was funny. The rest of the film was too predictable and I got bored with it.

759943,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00009YXEO,Michael Butts,"[3, 4]","Quirky and potentially interesting crime movie that loses its fizzle after its first two thirds.  Using a plot we've seen dozens of times before:  a hitman's bag of loot is stolen by a frenetic security guard, who the hitman was able to shoot before he got hit in the head with said bag; security guard crashes his car and crooked cop steals the money; crooked cop mails the bag to a bus station in 29 Palms.  The hitman's target happens to end up in 29 Palms after evading killers and he steals the bag from the whacked out bus clerk.  Target picks up a girl who is having car trouble and she takes the bag too.  Problem is the target has bought several like bags and who knows which one the money is in?All of this would work fine, but by the end of the movie, we're given so many flashbacks that don't make any sense and we're left wondering what in the world happened in those final minutes.  The talented cast includes Jeremy Davies as the target; Chris O'Donnell as the pretty inept hitman; Jon Polito as the security guard; Rachael Leigh Cook as the car trouble girl; Michael Rappaport as the dirty cop; Keith David as a marijuana smoking lawman, and a deliciously insane performance from Bill Pullman as the bus clerk.

But the intrigue ends there since the movie feels like it was left on the drawing board. The movie wallows in headachey camera edits and chrachters that are never draw out. The plot line feels familiar and rehashed. the shear confusion of the storyline and awkward charachters difuse any sort of interest in whats going on.The performaces are patciualrly poor by Chris Odonnell in faux cool mode and acting as hollow as ever. Jeremy Davies adds a slight bit of unabashed levity and understated acting though and Bill Pullman acts cracked out.
