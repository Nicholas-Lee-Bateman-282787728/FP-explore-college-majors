Most of the episodes aren't completely vomit inducing. I did like that the main character is a girl that's armed to the teeth and who's always willing to shoot and stab people at the drop of a hat. Kino basically seems to be a rip-off of Roland the main character from Steven King's Dark Tower series and the world seems to be exactly as disjointed and lawless as the middle world from the Dark Tower. Plus the basic theme is the same, a single lone gunman walks from place to place and comments on how absurd everything is with a plethora of quazi-deep philosophical platitudes.",4,Most episodes are good,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,679,"['Cheese-ball', 'lines', ""'ll"", 'give', 'balance', ""'ll"", 'give', 'speed', 'really', 'made', 'gag', 'Most', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'completely', 'vomit', 'inducing', 'did', 'main', 'character', 'girl', 'armed', 'teeth', 'who', 'always', 'willing', 'shoot', 'stab', 'people', 'drop', 'hat', 'Kino', 'basically', 'be', 'rip-off', 'Roland', 'main', 'character', 'Steven', 'King', 'Dark', 'Tower', 'series', 'world', 'be', 'exactly', 'disjointed', 'lawless', 'middle', 'world', 'Dark', 'Tower', 'basic', 'theme', 'same', 'single', 'lone', 'gunman', 'walks', 'place', 'place', 'comments', 'how', 'absurd', 'everything', 'plethora', 'quazi-deep', 'philosophical', 'platitudes']",N/A

Her constant companion is Hermes, a talking motorbike with a sarcastic bent.Together, they explore various social situations, and their potential consequences. Is knowing the thoughts of those around you a blessing or a curse? Is it right to live at the expense of another? What are the consequences of prophecy? Can a society truly divest itself of all its traditions? What does it mean to be a reasonable adult?We aren't always given answers to our questions, either. Kino is not a judge. She neither condones nor condemns those around her.In the second episode, we do see Kino fight against a group of slave traders, but this is only after they threaten Kino's own life.Despite some moments of graphic violence, this is a series that I would seriously consider sharing with children about ten or older.Oft times thoughtful, it is the quiet moments when we see that which is truly beautiful in the world.My sole complaint is that Kino's identity as a girl was supposed to be a surprise in the fourth episode, but the ADV english translation reveals it a bit early.The art style is intruigingly complex and simplistic at the same time, with vivid detail for the backgrounds and mechanical devices, but with remarkably plain character designs. The colors use a great deal of earth tones, and it is nowhere as brightly colored as some anime. The musical score is both vivid and haunting. The voice cast for both Japanese and English dialogue are superb.Personally, I wouldn't mind seeing a few more like this one.",5,Kino is...,1086220800,"06 3, 2004",2004,1776,"['something', 'be', 'said', 'use', 'quiet', 'story-telling', 'device.I', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'first', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'Kino', 'Journey', 'was', 'quickly', 'captivated', 'series.Kino', 'impartial', 'witness', 'traveling', 'one', 'land', 'next', 'constant', 'companion', 'Hermes', 'talking', 'motorbike', 'sarcastic', 'bent.Together', 'explore', 'various', 'social', 'situations', 'potential', 'consequences', 'knowing', 'thoughts', 'blessing', 'curse', 'right', 'live', 'expense', 'What', 'are', 'consequences', 'prophecy', 'Can', 'society', 'truly', 'divest', 'traditions', 'What', 'mean', 'be', 'reasonable', 'adult', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'given', 'answers', 'questions', 'either', 'Kino', 'not', 'judge', 'condones', 'condemns', 'second', 'episode', 'do', 'see', 'Kino', 'fight', 'group', 'slave', 'traders', 'only', 'threaten', 'Kino', 'own', 'moments', 'graphic', 'violence', 'series', 'would', 'seriously', 'consider', 'sharing', 'children', 'ten', 'older.Oft', 'times', 'thoughtful', 'quiet', 'moments', 'when', 'see', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'world.My', 'sole', 'complaint', 'Kino', 'identity', 'girl', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'surprise', 'fourth', 'episode', 'ADV', 'english', 'translation', 'reveals', 'bit', 'early.The', 'art', 'style', 'intruigingly', 'complex', 'simplistic', 'same', 'time', 'vivid', 'detail', 'backgrounds', 'mechanical', 'devices', 'remarkably', 'plain', 'character', 'designs', 'colors', 'use', 'great', 'deal', 'earth', 'tones', 'nowhere', 'as', 'brightly', 'colored', 'anime', 'musical', 'score', 'vivid', 'haunting', 'voice', 'cast', 'Japanese', 'English', 'dialogue', 'are', 'superb.Personally', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'few', 'more', 'one']",N/A

795458,A2ICKE6A3MJMM5,B00018D4XG,E. L. Green,"[1, 1]","The mysterious stranger coming to town is a trope that has been around for eons. Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns of the 1960's are a perfect example. The mysterious stranger comes to town, and nothing's the same again.Kino is the mysterious stranger here, though she rarely changes the towns she enters. Kino travels from town to town on her talking motorcycle, Hermes, experiencing the different civilizations on her world. She stays three days and two nights, then leaves.  Kino is a mystery, even her gender is a mystery for the first few episodes. She doesn't act like a stereotypical boy, or a stereotypical girl, she's Kino, as she reminds people who call her ""little boy"" or ""little girl"" (she's around 15 in the books, and presumably around the same age here, but she's a small person regardless of her age). We're told something of her background, of how she fled her home town when another mysterious stranger gave his life for her, of how she was trained in martial arts and weapons by a mysterious figure known only as ""Master"", but Kino is an enigma. Why is she traveling? What does she hope to accomplish? Where is she going? We're never told, though we can guess reasons why she may be traveling based on clues in the series.Kino is a bad-ass but not showy about it. She is a crack shot and also a collector of knives and to a certain extent embodies the ""small girl, big gun"" trope but rarely shoots except when absolutely necessary for survival, and most episodes never pulls her guns except to practice in the mirror or to clean them in her hotel room. She can be kind, she helps several people that she encounters in her travels, but she is also a dispassionate observer who rarely tries to intervene in anything big. Sometimes she does intervene, but her interventions are typically small -- there is none of the pyrotechnics of something like Eastwood's ""High Plains Drifter"" for the most part. Even the most action-filled episodes where she kills someone (there are three episodes out of thirteen where she kills someone), the killing is a shock simply because it is so out of the norm for this series.The result is oddly touching. Kino can take care of herself, she is tough and resilient, but you want to give her a hug from time to time when she encounters things that are disturbing. Kino rarely displays any outward emotion when encountering disturbing things, and makes only occasional objections when she runs across true atrocities, but you the viewer are more likely to be disturbed than Kino. She accepts the world as it is, not as she may wish it to be, with a stoicism devoid of cynicism, and somehow that makes this series even more disturbing. You wonder how she was hurt to make her like that.Definitely not easy viewing, it's a psychological series rather than an action series (there are some scenes of shocking violence, but they are few and far between, which is perhaps why they seem so shocking despite being tame by modern-day standards) and intended more to make you think and feel than as mindless entertainment. There's no fan service here and no big fighting robots or anything like that. No real plot -- for the most part Kino travels to a country, interacts with the citizens, learns disturbing things, moves on. No easy answers either -- each episode will raise questions, but you'll have to provide answers yourself. If there are any. Still, if you're in the right mindset, definitely a rewarding series to watch, and will leave you wanting more -- more backstory, more opportunities for growth on the part of Kino (note that the episodes are *not* in chronological order though they are in the correct order for the purposes of the original author), more of watching Kino interact with the world and trying to make sense of it, and maybe Kino eventually being able to answer for herself why she is travelling and what she hopes to accomplish. Alas, there's unlikely to ever be more.

So much of anime is misunderstood and misunderstood by the American audience, but this one (volume one, Idle Adventurer) speaks to anyone with a clear and philosophical voice that gives the viewer an insight into a dark and mysterious world that seems to be mostly just around the corner.One small criticism:  Kino's gender is left ambiguous (deliberately?) through most of volume 1.  If he's a guy, why would a guy want to marry him (episode 1, &quot;Land of Visible Pain&quot;)?

795465,A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,B00018D4XG,"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;""","[12, 13]","Originating as a series of novels, Kino's Journey is the story of Kino, a young wanderer and Hermes, the intelligent, somewhat sarcastic motorrad (motorcycle) that serves as vehicle and companion.  Kino travels are less adventures than they are philosophical moments that dig away as the thin veneer of the superficial that is the casual traveler's fare.Limiting each leg of the journey to three days, Kino and Hermes seek to find a momentary vision that reveals the heart of each country, often in uncomfortable terms.  The first episode, for instance turns into a reflection on the tragedy of a world where telepathy works, i.e., where nothing is secret.  Where the very thing that should bring people together makes any closeness impossible.From a technical standpoint, the artwork is graceful and understated.  It acts as a setting for the frequent interplays of thought that Hermes and Kino share.  This is the most onusual of conversations, moving from Kino's desire for food and Hermes' frequent worrying to sudden remarkable turns of phrase.  Director Ryutaro Nakamura (best known for his work on Serial Experiments Lain) strives for a impact and affect as he works toward a different form of aesthetic experience.  ""The world is not beautiful, and therefore it is.""Like Lain, Kino's Journey is a thinking person's type of anime.  The action often turns around intellectual reflections rather than external crises.  Objects frequently have unexpected symbolic contexts.

795466,A15TIGL6MKUWYU,B00018D4XG,"Mark E. Summers ""Gamekrazy""","[5, 6]","I have a slight warning to be prepared before you start watching Kino's journey.  In doing some checking to make sure it wasn't just my DVD, I found that the lines that are found throughout the anime were done intentionally and are not a defect.  Like watching a movie in widescreen, this might bother some people and they might not be able to deal with it.  For myself, I prefer widescreen and stopped noticing the lines through the video after the first few minutes.As for the series itself, I have to say it's something of a marvel.  Kino and Hermes, Kino's motorrad (a talking motorcycle) travel the world, visiting no country for more than three days.  As Kino observes, it's enough time to get a feel for the region and then it's time to go because staying for more than three days means less time that he can stay in another country.  Kino is also truthful enough to also admit that this reasoning may be a lie and that he's just afraid of liking a region too much and setting down roots, which would mean he would no longer be a traveller.Kino and Hermes spend a lot of time talking to one another, having philosophical discussions as they travel, about the places they're going to and what meets them when they get there.  Each country they travel through has their own set of laws and government and those who travel through them are not supposed to do anything to disturb their customs.  This manages to give us an interesting look at the world and see how things work and don't work.The first country Kino visits seems devoid of humanity, with machines performing all the roles that humans usually fulfill.  Kino is greeted by a machine as he enters the town, is served food by machines and is even given a room by one.  It's not until later that Kino notices there are people living nearby, but they are all alone and far spread out, with no one living with anyone else.  It's as Kino is leaving that he finally speaks with someone and finds out why the town is like that and how their hope for a Utopian society had led to their downfall and isolation.In the second episode, Kino doesn't actually visit a town but instead finds three men who are stuck in the snow and are near the point of starvation.  Kino stops to help them but even then questions his own motives in doing so, as he feels no paricular regard for them.  It's these ruminations that Kino and Hermes have throughout this episode that really intersted me.In the third episode, Kino visits several towns, with several of the stories about the towns overlapping.  It's done in an interesting style, the way these stories weave together, without the point being hammered into your head.  I enjoyed the flow, especially with the first country, where the end of the world is being predicted the following day, so everyone gives Kino what he is shopping for for free.I can't say much for the final episode because I wouldn't want to spoil anything for someone on their first viewing of it.  There is a twist here, which is about all I can safely say without giving it away.  Depending on whether you watch the anime in English or Japanese will also give you some clues as to what's going on.  I think the English version gave away some hints too early on, but maybe that's just me.  All in all, I recommend this show for anyone who likes to think.  It isn't all out action for those that just like fighting animes, but for those who like their anime to challenge their intellect a bit, I can highly recommend this show.",5,Enjoy the journey with Kino,1077840000,"02 27, 2004",2004,3493,"['have', 'slight', 'warning', 'be', 'prepared', 'start', 'watching', 'Kino', 'journey', 'doing', 'checking', 'make', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'DVD', 'found', 'lines', 'are', 'found', 'anime', 'were', 'done', 'intentionally', 'are', 'not', 'defect', 'watching', 'movie', 'widescreen', 'might', 'bother', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'deal', 'prefer', 'widescreen', 'stopped', 'noticing', 'lines', 'video', 'first', 'few', 'minutes.As', 'series', 'have', 'say', 'something', 'marvel', 'Kino', 'Hermes', 'Kino', 'motorrad', 'talking', 'motorcycle', 'travel', 'world', 'visiting', 'country', 'more', 'three', 'days', 'Kino', 'enough', 'time', 'get', 'feel', 'region', 'then', 'time', 'go', 'staying', 'more', 'three', 'days', 'less', 'time', 'can', 'stay', 'country', 'Kino', 'also', 'truthful', 'enough', 'also', 'admit', 'reasoning', 'may', 'be', 'lie', 'just', 'afraid', 'liking', 'region', 'too', 'much', 'setting', 'down', 'roots', 'would', 'mean', 'would', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'traveller.Kino', 'Hermes', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'talking', 'one', 'having', 'philosophical', 'discussions', 'travel', 'places', ""'re"", 'going', 'what', 'when', 'get', 'there', 'country', 'travel', 'own', 'set', 'laws', 'government', 'who', 'travel', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'do', 'anything', 'disturb', 'customs', 'give', 'interesting', 'look', 'world', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'work.The', 'first', 'country', 'Kino', 'devoid', 'humanity', 'machines', 'performing', 'roles', 'usually', 'fulfill', 'Kino', 'greeted', 'machine', 'town', 'served', 'food', 'machines', 'even', 'given', 'room', 'one', 'not', 'later', 'Kino', 'notices', 'are', 'people', 'living', 'nearby', 'are', 'alone', 'far', 'spread', 'out', 'one', 'living', 'anyone', 'else', 'Kino', 'leaving', 'finally', 'someone', 'out', 'why', 'town', 'how', 'hope', 'Utopian', 'society', 'had', 'led', 'downfall', 'isolation.In', 'second', 'episode', 'Kino', ""n't"", 'actually', 'visit', 'town', 'instead', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'stuck', 'snow', 'are', 'point', 'starvation', 'Kino', 'help', 'even', 'then', 'questions', 'own', 'motives', 'doing', 'so', 'paricular', 'regard', 'ruminations', 'Kino', 'Hermes', 'have', 'episode', 'really', 'intersted', 'third', 'episode', 'Kino', 'several', 'towns', 'several', 'stories', 'towns', 'overlapping', 'done', 'interesting', 'style', 'way', 'stories', 'weave', 'together', 'point', 'being', 'hammered', 'head', 'enjoyed', 'flow', 'especially', 'first', 'country', 'where', 'end', 'world', 'being', 'predicted', 'following', 'day', 'everyone', 'Kino', 'what', 'shopping', 'free.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'final', 'episode', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'someone', 'first', 'viewing', 'twist', 'here', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'giving', 'away', 'Depending', 'watch', 'anime', 'English', 'Japanese', 'will', 'also', 'give', 'clues', 'what', 'going', 'think', 'English', 'version', 'gave', 'away', 'hints', 'too', 'early', 'maybe', 'just', 'recommend', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'think', ""n't"", 'out', 'action', 'just', 'fighting', 'animes', 'who', 'like', 'anime', 'challenge', 'intellect', 'bit', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show']",N/A

795469,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B00018D4XG,Sesho,"[4, 4]","Kino is a young girl who travels through different countries, never staying for longer than 3 days, because she is afraid that if she stays longer, she might settle down. Her only companion is her motorcycle, Hermes. Hermes has sentience and can speak to Kino and other people. Each episode is a different adventure as she encounters people of all types and countries, each with their own customs and problems.This dvd has the first four episodes of Kino's Journey.In &quot;Land of Visible Pain&quot;, Kino and Hermes come upon a city that has no visible human inhabitants, only robots who wait on their every need. Where did all the people go? They will find out soon enough. The second episode is about Kino helping out 3 truckdrivers whose vehicle has become trapped in a blizzard and are starving to death. &quot;Land of Prophecies&quot;, the 3rd episode concerns a country where the people believe that the next morning after Kino arrives will be the last day before the earth ends. In the last episode, we learn a little more about Kino in a flashback to her childhood in which we learn the origins of her wanderings and how she came to meet up with Hermes.This was a great dvd and should appeal to those anime watchers who like a lot of story instead of giant robots fighting each other. It almost seems like a book, and actually, this anime is based on a series of books published in Japan. It is pretty hardhitting and philisophical and should appeal more to adults than to kids. There are scenes of some graphic violence, such as a man getting shot in the head and a stabbing.
