1329232,A1VDRK69F22YMN,B0036VH97C,Anticlimacus,"[1, 1]","A girl is ditched by her stepmother but befriends a rich old woman and subsequently moves in with the family, which consists of two spoiled grandchildren and their high maintenance mother.  The old woman (who owns a prosperous beef soup restaurant chain) then decides to give her inheritance to the new girl, which creates consternation within the family as well as the company.  By the end of episode 5 all of the main characters are set up in very compelling ways and the conflicts are based off of manipulation, misinformation and ignorance, so the viewer is glued to the screen to see if (and when) each of the characters discover the little truths that have been hidden away from them.  The protagonist's stepmother is a backstabbing, manipulative wench who could very well be the most despicable character in the history of K-dramas (the viewer's blood is guaranteed to boil furiously!).  False accusations and rumors are piled onto the lead protagonist in huge quantities, but her perseverance builds character and makes her very likable.  Hyo-joo Han turns in a great performance that demands a wide range of emotion.  On the negative side, there are contrivances and coincidences that do get annoying at times, but the dramatic elements are so emotionally affecting that this K-drama series (28 episodes, 60 minutes each) cannot be denied its rightful place as one of the best ever.",5,Very Good!,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,1391,"['girl', 'ditched', 'stepmother', 'rich', 'old', 'woman', 'subsequently', 'moves', 'family', 'two', 'spoiled', 'grandchildren', 'high', 'maintenance', 'mother', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'prosperous', 'beef', 'soup', 'restaurant', 'chain', 'then', 'give', 'inheritance', 'new', 'girl', 'consternation', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'company', 'end', '5', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'very', 'compelling', 'ways', 'conflicts', 'are', 'based', 'manipulation', 'misinformation', 'ignorance', 'viewer', 'glued', 'screen', 'see', 'when', 'characters', 'discover', 'little', 'truths', 'have', 'been', 'hidden', 'away', 'protagonist', 'stepmother', 'backstabbing', 'manipulative', 'wench', 'who', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'most', 'despicable', 'character', 'history', 'K-dramas', 'viewer', 'blood', 'guaranteed', 'boil', 'furiously', 'False', 'accusations', 'rumors', 'are', 'piled', 'lead', 'protagonist', 'huge', 'quantities', 'perseverance', 'builds', 'character', 'very', 'likable', 'Hyo-joo', 'Han', 'great', 'performance', 'wide', 'range', 'emotion', 'negative', 'side', 'are', 'contrivances', 'coincidences', 'do', 'get', 'annoying', 'times', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'are', 'so', 'emotionally', 'affecting', 'K-drama', 'series', '28', 'episodes', '60', 'minutes', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'rightful', 'place', 'one', 'best', 'ever']",N/A

1329236,A1DZX6MVC1ABYT,B0036VH97C,K. Canales,"[11, 11]","I bought this drama without any previous knowledge of what it was about. I have to admit that the nice cover art and catchy title combined with YAentertainmen's track record did it for me. All twenty-eight episodes of this series are well paced and thought out. The story is, albeit predictable to a fault, enjoyable and each episode ends in a rather nice cliffhanger. There is always something interesting to look forward to throughout the series, meaning that it does not get annoyingly repetitive. The antagonists are scheming and conniving, but you can still find personality traits and emotions which lead to you empathize with them at times. The main characters are good hearted, but not naive. Once the protagonist, Eug-Seung, realizes her family betrayed her, she does not believe them again and analyzes their behavior (step mom and sister) and the implications it has had in what happened to her. I don't want to give it away,  but this actress sure knows how to cry a good tear.The packaging is O.K., there is nothing amazing about it. It is just an artbox with three individual DVD cases inside. The last case contains two smiley face pins (the ones used by the employees at Jinsung). The only tiny problem I noticed with the subtitles was somewhere in DVD case #2 where some words were switched, as in ""he is the in room."" Other than that, nothing else worth mentioning.I have to say that the price here in Amazon is a bit steep. I would either wait for it to be on sale or shop around (there are other places where you can save money). Other than that, I'm sure you'll enjoy this series",5,If I could only pronounce the names...,1272240000,"04 26, 2010",2010,1600,"['bought', 'drama', 'previous', 'knowledge', 'what', 'was', 'have', 'admit', 'nice', 'cover', 'art', 'catchy', 'title', 'combined', 'YAentertainmen', 'track', 'record', 'did', 'twenty-eight', 'episodes', 'series', 'are', 'well', 'paced', 'thought', 'out', 'story', 'albeit', 'predictable', 'fault', 'enjoyable', 'episode', 'rather', 'nice', 'cliffhanger', 'always', 'something', 'interesting', 'look', 'forward', 'series', 'meaning', 'not', 'get', 'annoyingly', 'repetitive', 'antagonists', 'are', 'scheming', 'conniving', 'can', 'still', 'find', 'personality', 'traits', 'emotions', 'lead', 'empathize', 'times', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'hearted', 'not', 'naive', 'protagonist', 'Eug-Seung', 'family', 'betrayed', 'not', 'believe', 'again', 'analyzes', 'behavior', 'step', 'mom', 'sister', 'implications', 'had', 'what', 'happened', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'actress', 'sure', 'how', 'cry', 'good', 'tear.The', 'packaging', 'O.K.', 'nothing', 'amazing', 'just', 'artbox', 'three', 'individual', 'DVD', 'cases', 'inside', 'last', 'case', 'two', 'smiley', 'face', 'pins', 'ones', 'used', 'employees', 'Jinsung', 'only', 'tiny', 'problem', 'noticed', 'subtitles', 'was', 'somewhere', 'DVD', 'case', '2', 'where', 'words', 'were', 'switched', 'room', 'Other', 'nothing', 'else', 'worth', 'mentioning.I', 'have', 'say', 'price', 'here', 'Amazon', 'bit', 'steep', 'would', 'either', 'wait', 'be', 'sale', 'shop', 'around', 'are', 'other', 'places', 'where', 'can', 'save', 'money', 'Other', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'series']",N/A

A young lady, although abandoned by her step-mother, takes in an old woman off the street who is hurt and has temporary memory loss. Turns out that the old woman is rich and the head of a prosperous company, and after regaining her memory, puts the girl to the test by doing irrational and annoying things. After obtaining a promise that she will not be abandoned, the old woman decides to return the favor and takes the girl home, threatening to make the girl her heir in place of the irresponsible, spoiled family. The threat has a redemptive, if hilarious, effect on the family, as the grandma puts them all to work in her company.",5,Fun story about compassion,1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,711,"['favorite', 'K-Dramas', 'have', 'strong', 'core', 'values', 'one', 'compassion', 'young', 'lady', 'abandoned', 'step-mother', 'old', 'woman', 'street', 'who', 'hurt', 'temporary', 'memory', 'loss', 'out', 'old', 'woman', 'rich', 'head', 'prosperous', 'company', 'regaining', 'memory', 'girl', 'test', 'doing', 'irrational', 'annoying', 'things', 'obtaining', 'promise', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'abandoned', 'old', 'woman', 'return', 'favor', 'girl', 'home', 'threatening', 'make', 'girl', 'heir', 'place', 'irresponsible', 'spoiled', 'family', 'threat', 'redemptive', 'hilarious', 'effect', 'family', 'grandma', 'work', 'company']",N/A
