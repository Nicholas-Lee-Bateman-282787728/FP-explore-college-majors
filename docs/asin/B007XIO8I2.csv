I do not think it is the greatest zombie film ever but it is very good for one of the indie zombie films that have come out. It is low budget but I do not think that hurt this movie. The cinematography is good and the acting is pretty good. Overall, I wish that more of the current crop of zombie films were more like this. It just seemed to have a good blend and good pacing to it. There are a few nitpicks here and there but overall it is well worth the watch and a buy honestly.

Through the years, I've seen literally hundreds of zombie films. Varying from the incredibly cheesy to the hardcore. The ones that ended up being my favorites were the ones that mostly everybody else liked because they were the ones that, even though it were more of the same, they added their own unique spin on things(Most recently; Pontypool, Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies, Zombieland, Exit Humanity, Dawn & Day of the Dead, Rec, Zombie Dearest, Fido, Shaun of the Dead, The Dead..for examples). Some were made on small or no budgets at all, really, but they made a lasting impression.  I come to Zombie Undead thinking I'd, at least, walk away from the experience satisfied that I got a good zombie fix whether or not they put their own spin on things. Well guess what? They didn't. They didn't...do alot of things with this picture and that left me very..wait, scratch that..extremely disappointed and pissed off that I wasted good money on this.Sarah's father is bleeding, and she knows he will die if she doesn't get him to a hospital fast. The scene that greets them on arrival is one of chaos and horror as bodies of the dying and injured are lying about. Sarah stumbles and falls and loses consciousness. Yet, when she regains consciousness, she realizes that she's alone tere or is she? That's pretty much the plot of this movie.You're probably wondering what it is that I dislike about Zombie Undead. Well, everything in the movie seems uninspired to me. Everything from the acting to the script to the zombie makeup. Heck, even the zombie attacks/kills. None of it failed to interest or excite me. It was dull, boring and lifeless. Okay, so it was a low budget movie..that's still no excuse for this drivel. Heck, Automaton Transfusion was made on a low budget and it turned out pretty decent(least, it held my interest til the end). I know everyone is entitled to their opinion(I respect that, believe me) but calling this movie a game-changer? &lt;smh> I'm sorry. I'm just not buying it. Course, I wish I hadn't have bought it. Sorry, folks, but I believe in telling the truth. It did absolutely nothing for me.

Can't they take a minute to wash it off?

Secondly if you are in a building that has zombies, don't ride the elevator as you don't know what is going to be outside the doors when they open. When you suspect the zombie infestation is caused by a blood borne pathogen, don't leave infected blood on your skin. Immediately wash it off and disinfect with a 10% Clorax solution. Also according to the Homeland Security handbook, the people who will actually be infected first are old people, children, and those with weak immune systems. Not every bite transmits the disease, but you need extra precaution and a holding cell/ isolation room during the incubation period.
