I am happy Kristin was back for Season 6, as she always adds a whole new dynamic to the show! I also liked to see that everyone got along a lot better in this season.  Of all the seasons though, this seemed to be the most staged.  While its understandable, there was a certain cheese factor.  The cast was overly done up when they shot episodes, it made the show seem really fake.  While its understandable, that with all the fame the cast has gained from the show it is unrealistic to be able to shoot the show without any staged set ups, it could have been done a lot better.I did enjoy the ending, especially, if you remember towards the end of the show how the media was saying how fake the whole show was.  It was fun to see MTV admit that not all of it is real.  All in all, I am a big fan of the hills and wished Kristin would have been around for all the seasons, which is why I loved this season so much!",4,Sad to see The Hills go,1335916800,"05 2, 2012",2012,1008,"['was', 'surprised', 'liked', 'season', 'absence', 'LC', 'actually', 'really', 'liked', 'am', 'happy', 'Kristin', 'was', 'back', 'Season', '6', 'always', 'whole', 'new', 'dynamic', 'show', 'also', 'liked', 'see', 'everyone', 'got', 'lot', 'better', 'season', 'seasons', 'seemed', 'be', 'most', 'staged', 'understandable', 'was', 'certain', 'cheese', 'factor', 'cast', 'was', 'overly', 'done', 'up', 'when', 'shot', 'episodes', 'made', 'show', 'seem', 'really', 'fake', 'understandable', 'fame', 'cast', 'gained', 'show', 'unrealistic', 'be', 'able', 'shoot', 'show', 'staged', 'set', 'ups', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'lot', 'better.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'ending', 'especially', 'remember', 'end', 'show', 'how', 'media', 'was', 'saying', 'how', 'fake', 'whole', 'show', 'was', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'MTV', 'admit', 'not', 'real', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'hills', 'wished', 'Kristin', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'seasons', 'why', 'loved', 'season', 'so', 'much']",N/A
1380292,A1I61T0VRK0JKQ,B0041KKX3O,BarryChamplain,"[14, 15]","A number of years ago this series started by following Lauren Conrad from the last episode of Laguna Beach Season 1 to California. The first two or three seasons, in my opinion, were great and very believable. From the third season on, it was obvious that the whole thing was becoming too popular, staged and that acting and random former Laguna cast members were brought in to create more ""drama"". Also, Lauren was and is ""The Hills"". I found it very fitting that the only cast member who actually went to school, internships, got a job and started a career was the first to jump off the sinking ship. After Lauren left the church early at Heidi and Spencer's wedding in season 5, this series should have been over. Instead, MTV decided to double dip in the Laguna Beach pot and bring in the most annoying character (although the hottest) from the series, Kristin Cavalleri. There is no real understanding as to where she came from. And it just seemed extremely forced and desperate for the show producers to run with this idea.Lauren Conrad seems like a very mature, driven and smart young lady. I am looking forward to her new reality show that focuses more on her real life than petty ""drama"", boyfriends and visits to the club every night.The death blow to the show was the creation of a romantic relationship between the two lamest cast members, Brody Jenner and Kristen Cavalleri. Both of whom are just painfully boring. Two rich and jobless people who do nothing but go to clubs and complain about petty garbage. So all that's left is LC hanger-on Lo, Spencer's sister, the Audrina and ""Justin Bobby"" relationship and her brief fling with former one hit wonder Ryan Cabrerra. Yawn! Predictable, boring, garbage. To make things worse, Heidi and Spencer disappear from the series for an unknown or explained reason. The series ends in a Laguna Beach graduation episodes-esque manner. All the girls sit around talking about what they will do next in their lives and then have a going away party! Oh yeah, people are supposed to look at this as a ""reality"" show. So on the last episode it's very convenient that the cast has a ""future plans"" talk and a pool party. This is like Laguna Beach ""graduation and moving away talk"" and ""graduation party/leaving town"". Lame move. The series then ends with Brody and Kristin basically saying that the series was partially or completely staged and acted out as the Hollywood sign background rolls away to expose a Hollywood studio lot. The final season of the Hills was all hype and absolutely no delivery.The DVD itself is very basic. Just the episodes. No special features. I have a feeling that MTV will release a complete season box set one of these days, so I'd say to stay away from this DVD purchase for awhile. If anything, the price will only go further down.2/5. Entertaining just to see how it would end. Very disappointing for a final season. The DVD itself  is unimpressive with no special features.",2,"Without Lauren Conrad, the Hills dies a slow, boring death.",1288224000,"10 28, 2010",2010,2957,"['number', 'years', 'series', 'started', 'following', 'Lauren', 'Conrad', 'last', 'episode', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'Season', '1', 'California', 'first', 'two', 'three', 'seasons', 'opinion', 'were', 'great', 'very', 'believable', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'obvious', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'becoming', 'too', 'popular', 'staged', 'acting', 'random', 'former', 'Laguna', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'brought', 'create', 'more', 'drama', 'Also', 'Lauren', 'was', 'Hills', 'found', 'very', 'fitting', 'only', 'cast', 'member', 'who', 'actually', 'went', 'school', 'internships', 'got', 'job', 'started', 'career', 'was', 'first', 'jump', 'off', 'sinking', 'ship', 'Lauren', 'left', 'church', 'early', 'Heidi', 'Spencer', 'wedding', 'season', '5', 'series', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Instead', 'MTV', 'decided', 'double', 'dip', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'pot', 'bring', 'most', 'annoying', 'character', 'hottest', 'series', 'Kristin', 'Cavalleri', 'real', 'understanding', 'where', 'came', 'just', 'seemed', 'extremely', 'forced', 'desperate', 'show', 'producers', 'run', 'idea.Lauren', 'Conrad', 'very', 'mature', 'driven', 'smart', 'young', 'lady', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'new', 'reality', 'show', 'more', 'real', 'life', 'petty', 'drama', 'boyfriends', 'visits', 'club', 'night.The', 'death', 'blow', 'show', 'was', 'creation', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'two', 'lamest', 'cast', 'members', 'Brody', 'Jenner', 'Kristen', 'Cavalleri', 'whom', 'are', 'just', 'painfully', 'boring', 'Two', 'rich', 'jobless', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'nothing', 'go', 'clubs', 'complain', 'petty', 'garbage', 'So', 'left', 'LC', 'hanger-on', 'Lo', 'Spencer', 'sister', 'Audrina', 'Justin', 'Bobby', 'relationship', 'brief', 'fling', 'former', 'one', 'hit', 'wonder', 'Ryan', 'Cabrerra', 'Yawn', 'Predictable', 'boring', 'garbage', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'Heidi', 'Spencer', 'disappear', 'series', 'unknown', 'explained', 'reason', 'series', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'graduation', 'episodes-esque', 'manner', 'girls', 'sit', 'talking', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'lives', 'then', 'have', 'going', 'away', 'party', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'people', 'are', 'supposed', 'look', 'reality', 'show', 'So', 'last', 'episode', 'very', 'convenient', 'cast', 'future', 'plans', 'talk', 'pool', 'party', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'graduation', 'moving', 'away', 'talk', 'graduation', 'party/leaving', 'town', 'Lame', 'move', 'series', 'then', 'Brody', 'Kristin', 'basically', 'saying', 'series', 'was', 'partially', 'completely', 'staged', 'acted', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'sign', 'background', 'away', 'expose', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'lot', 'final', 'season', 'Hills', 'was', 'hype', 'absolutely', 'delivery.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'basic', 'Just', 'episodes', 'special', 'features', 'have', 'feeling', 'MTV', 'will', 'release', 'complete', 'season', 'box', 'set', 'one', 'days', ""'d"", 'say', 'stay', 'away', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'awhile', 'anything', 'price', 'will', 'only', 'go', 'further', 'down.2/5', 'Entertaining', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'end', 'Very', 'disappointing', 'final', 'season', 'DVD', 'unimpressive', 'special', 'features']",N/A
