747641,A2RQ0SJXNHPFDG,B00008VDUC,Doctor Quartz,"[73, 86]","This is a decent history of Syd and the Pink Floyd (the narration could have been better written and delivered), but there should be more footage, more interviews, more analysis, better graphics, etc.  This DVD is about an hour long.  Which is maddening.  It's like getting a single bite from a fantastic piece of cake on a buffet table filled with gastronomic riches, and then being shuffled out of the eatery.  I don't understand why there isn't a 9 or 10 DVD set on the history of Pink Floyd with at least 6 hours on just Syd?  Where are all the TV show performances?  They are one of the biggest bands of all time, and this is the only DVD history of the band in its early days?  We've got a lousy biography (Saucerful of Secrets) written by the wrong author (thank god Nick Mason has a book coming out)--and a couple of compilations of old clippings.  With the Beatles there are literally hundreds of books to read.  We've got the ""ANTHOLOGY"" DVD set.  But with the Floyd we get these measly little crumbs.  What are they thinking?  David Gilmour, Roger Waters, Richard Wright and Nick Mason should put together a big DVD history of their band, before everyone worth interviewing dies out.  The people from their generation are beginning to drop like flies. There's little time left to put something together.  And what's up with the cover picture on this DVD?

That only lasts a few seconds, like most of the concert footage.This DVD is a documentary of the Syd Barrett years and a very entertaining one at that.  It's well worth adding to your collection if you're a Floyd fan.The bonus features are interesting, but could have been much better.  Concert footage (featuring entire songs, not snippets) from the early days of Floyd would have been perfect to add, and would make this DVD a 5-star masterpiece.  I know there's footage of Syd & Floyd in concert performing Astronomy Domine - why not add that instead of cover versions of Barrett & Floyd songs?Oh well, it gets four stars anyhow.

747646,A3G2DMLKUDFO5Q,B00008VDUC,landru141,"[25, 26]","For those of us in America, this was the original documentary chopped up into the version shown on VH1.  This documentary is infinitely superior to the US for a few key reasons.  Mostly because it is more detailed about the later history of Syd's life and music and because it allows for the possibility that Syd wasn't just an acid casualty, but something more interesting.  Perhaps he deliberately used his ""breakdown"" as an excuse.  If so, his continued silence has probably gotten him more than if he'd broken it.  As a Syd Barrett fan, it is important that something about the man should appear, beyond the rip-offs like ""Syd's First Trip"".The story is told in chronological order with interesting interviews with every member of the band, apart from Syd, of course.  Roger ""Syd"" Barrett has basically turned his back on the world of music for 30 years, despite the underground cult he seems to feed by doing so.  It is ironic that his absence should be the cause of his continued fascination.  No doubt if he turned up on an interview, now a much older man (as are the rest of Pink Floyd) it would be a pin in the balloon.This documentary is really both for fans and non-fans alike.  It glosses over periods, while expounds on others.  The music is inter-cut throughout, with some nice emphasis on the later solo work.  The major inaccuracy that seems to occur because of editing, is the one that comes up all the time.  It's a question of timeline.  Syd was ousted from the band in 1968, though they did record a few of his songs (some are still unreleased, one appeared on the 1968 Saucerful of Secrets album.)  Syd's solo recordings began in 1968 and were carried into 1969.  Much of the first solo LP was recorded in that period, but wasn't released until 1970.  The second solo album was recorded quickly in 1970 and released at the end of that same year.  It was then, and only then, that Syd really stopped.The documentary is good.  I recommend it.  For the fan, its essential.  For the casual watcher, its really interesting stuff.  It certainly gives perspective on everything Pink Floyd did afterward.",5,What exactly is a dream?,1117670400,"06 2, 2005",2005,2117,"['America', 'was', 'original', 'documentary', 'chopped', 'up', 'version', 'shown', 'VH1', 'documentary', 'infinitely', 'superior', 'US', 'few', 'key', 'reasons', 'Mostly', 'more', 'detailed', 'later', 'history', 'Syd', 'life', 'music', 'possibility', 'Syd', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'acid', 'casualty', 'something', 'more', 'interesting', 'Perhaps', 'deliberately', 'used', 'breakdown', 'excuse', 'so', 'continued', 'silence', 'probably', 'gotten', 'more', ""'d"", 'broken', 'Syd', 'Barrett', 'fan', 'important', 'something', 'man', 'should', 'appear', 'rip-offs', 'Syd', 'First', 'Trip', '.The', 'story', 'told', 'chronological', 'order', 'interesting', 'interviews', 'member', 'band', 'apart', 'Syd', 'course', 'Roger', 'Syd', 'Barrett', 'basically', 'turned', 'back', 'world', 'music', '30', 'years', 'underground', 'cult', 'feed', 'doing', 'so', 'ironic', 'absence', 'should', 'be', 'cause', 'continued', 'fascination', 'No', 'doubt', 'turned', 'up', 'interview', 'now', 'much', 'older', 'man', 'are', 'rest', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'would', 'be', 'pin', 'balloon.This', 'documentary', 'really', 'fans', 'non-fans', 'alike', 'periods', 'expounds', 'others', 'music', 'inter-cut', 'nice', 'emphasis', 'later', 'solo', 'work', 'major', 'inaccuracy', 'occur', 'editing', 'one', 'up', 'time', 'question', 'timeline', 'Syd', 'was', 'ousted', 'band', '1968', 'did', 'record', 'few', 'songs', 'are', 'still', 'unreleased', 'one', 'appeared', '1968', 'Saucerful', 'Secrets', 'album', 'Syd', 'solo', 'recordings', 'began', '1968', 'were', 'carried', '1969', 'Much', 'first', 'solo', 'LP', 'was', 'recorded', 'period', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', '1970', 'second', 'solo', 'album', 'was', 'recorded', 'quickly', '1970', 'released', 'end', 'same', 'year', 'was', 'then', 'only', 'then', 'Syd', 'really', 'stopped.The', 'documentary', 'good', 'recommend', 'fan', 'essential', 'casual', 'watcher', 'really', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'certainly', 'perspective', 'everything', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'did', 'afterward']",N/A

I did not know (though I had expected it) that much of the Pink-character was inspired by the life (and fate) of Syd Barrett. I had never heard that coming from Roger Waters' mouth until now, and of course; It makes sence having always thought that it was mainly inspired from the life of Roger himself (which it also partly is), but as mentioned the Pink-character has always reminded more to me of Syd. So now the ""bricks seem more fit"" (though to many Floyd-fans this might be old news, I don't know..?)What the about 45 minutes documentary is missing is actually more of Syd. Ironically it does being mainly a tribute to him, and his genious. We see tiny bits of an interview he and Roger once did, I wanted to hear more. We see tiny bits of some rare consert-footage with Syd in the lead, but I wanted to see more. We see plenty of old photographs of Syd, which is great (many of those photos are great, and say so much about his condition by looking at the captured expressions on his face becoming more and more unrecognizable), but all in all I was still ""hungry"" after watching it the first time. And I still am. Much of what lies out on the internet are rumours and lies when it comes to facts about Syd -so I can't help feeling a bit let down by an otherwise so great documentary about one of the most peculiar personalities in the history of rock'n roll.So if you are interested in Floyd, this one's a ""must""!",4,A very interesting documentary...,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,1806,"['having', 'seen', 'flower-power-cover', 'edition', 'here', 'amazon.com', 'think', 'preffer', 'mine', '-not', 'much', 'minor', 'detail', 'considering', 'what', 'inside', '.I', 'will', 'start', 'saying', 'documentary', 'answered', 'many', 'questions', 'mysterious', 'Syd', 'origin', 'one', 'favorite', 'bands', 'even', 'Wall', 'now', 'got', 'whole', 'new', 'meaning', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'had', 'expected', 'much', 'Pink-character', 'was', 'inspired', 'life', 'fate', 'Syd', 'Barrett', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'coming', 'Roger', 'Waters', 'mouth', 'now', 'course', 'sence', 'having', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'mainly', 'inspired', 'life', 'Roger', 'also', 'partly', 'mentioned', 'Pink-character', 'always', 'reminded', 'more', 'Syd', 'So', 'now', 'bricks', 'seem', 'more', 'fit', 'many', 'Floyd-fans', 'might', 'be', 'old', 'news', 'do', ""n't"", 'know..', 'What', 'about', '45', 'minutes', 'documentary', 'missing', 'actually', 'more', 'Syd', 'Ironically', 'being', 'mainly', 'tribute', 'genious', 'see', 'tiny', 'bits', 'interview', 'Roger', 'once', 'did', 'wanted', 'hear', 'more', 'see', 'tiny', 'bits', 'rare', 'consert-footage', 'Syd', 'lead', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'see', 'plenty', 'old', 'photographs', 'Syd', 'great', 'many', 'photos', 'are', 'great', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'condition', 'looking', 'captured', 'expressions', 'face', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'unrecognizable', 'was', 'still', 'hungry', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'still', 'am', 'Much', 'what', 'out', 'internet', 'are', 'rumours', 'when', 'facts', 'Syd', '-so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'otherwise', 'so', 'great', 'documentary', 'one', 'most', 'peculiar', 'personalities', 'history', 'rock', 'n', 'roll.So', 'are', 'interested', 'Floyd', 'one', 'must']",N/A
