733616,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B0000844LS,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[5, 9]","""The Weight of Water"" is the most artistic and literary of Bigelow's film, the furthest from the action-adventure genre.  Although it has thrilling moments of disaster at sea, it is primarily a character study.  There are 4 people aboard a yacht, the most pivotal being Sean Penn, playing a writer whose writing days are mainly in the past because they were all based on an early tragedy involving the loss of the love of his life.  He's married to someone else now but has serious relationship problems which are exacerbated by having another woman on board who has captured his sexual interest (Elizabeth Hurley).  Where this film really gets interesting though is unveiling a whole other story of a woman who used to live on an island in these waters over a century ago who may, or may not, have murdered two other women.  Sarah Polley does a wonderful job playing her.  The underwater sequences during the storm at sea involving this woman's ghost and our present day people are the most artistic and stunning of Bigelow's career.  I saw this as a rental and immediately wished I had bought it instead.  This is Bigelow at her best as a filmmaker, artist and storyteller all rolled into one (based on the source Anita Shreve novel). Writer-director Kathryn Bigelow was a very talented painter before she went to film school to become a movie director.  It shows in her work which is very artistic for someone primarily known to the action-adventure genre of filmmaking.  She is a breath of fresh air in this genre, investing it with literate scripts and haunting imagery.  Her most frequent producer is James Cameron (the action wonder king, ""Titanic,"" ""Terminator""), who is also her ex-husband.  You can see his influence on her work as well.",5,"Bigelow: Artistic, Literary & Haunting",1059436800,"07 29, 2003",2003,1747,"['Weight', 'Water', 'most', 'artistic', 'literary', 'Bigelow', 'film', 'furthest', 'action-adventure', 'genre', 'thrilling', 'moments', 'disaster', 'sea', 'primarily', 'character', 'study', 'are', '4', 'people', 'yacht', 'most', 'pivotal', 'being', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'playing', 'writer', 'writing', 'days', 'are', 'mainly', 'past', 'were', 'based', 'early', 'tragedy', 'involving', 'loss', 'love', 'life', 'married', 'someone', 'else', 'now', 'serious', 'relationship', 'problems', 'are', 'exacerbated', 'having', 'woman', 'board', 'who', 'captured', 'sexual', 'interest', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'Where', 'film', 'really', 'interesting', 'though', 'unveiling', 'whole', 'other', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'used', 'live', 'island', 'waters', 'century', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'murdered', 'two', 'other', 'women', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'wonderful', 'job', 'playing', 'underwater', 'sequences', 'storm', 'sea', 'involving', 'woman', 'ghost', 'present', 'day', 'people', 'are', 'most', 'artistic', 'stunning', 'Bigelow', 'career', 'saw', 'rental', 'immediately', 'wished', 'had', 'bought', 'instead', 'Bigelow', 'best', 'filmmaker', 'artist', 'storyteller', 'rolled', 'one', 'based', 'source', 'Anita', 'Shreve', 'novel', 'Writer-director', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'was', 'very', 'talented', 'painter', 'went', 'film', 'school', 'become', 'movie', 'director', 'work', 'very', 'artistic', 'someone', 'primarily', 'known', 'action-adventure', 'genre', 'filmmaking', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'genre', 'investing', 'literate', 'scripts', 'haunting', 'imagery', 'most', 'frequent', 'producer', 'James', 'Cameron', 'action', 'wonder', 'king', 'Titanic', 'Terminator', 'who', 'also', 'ex-husband', 'can', 'see', 'influence', 'work', 'as', 'well']",N/A

Von Behren ""reneofc""","[4, 4]","If I hadn't already read the novel by Anita Shreve upon which this film is based, I think I would have found the switching back and forth from the turn of the century to the present offsetting.  As I anticipated the older story and the parallel emotions its discovery brings to the surface in the modern story, I found Bigelow's technique sufficiently expert to convey the story's message and tone.As in the book, Jean, a photojournalist is married to Thomas an award winning poet.  Jean has been assigned the task of photographing the environs of the isolated islands off the coast of Maine and New Hamphire, where two horrific murders occurred over a century before.  As she, Thomas, her brother-in-law and her brother-in-law's too attractive girlfriend, Adaline, sail along the treacherous coastline, the audience infers by the foursome's moody dialogue and the flirtatious yet melancholy interplay between Thomas and Adaline---punctuated with plenty of ice clinking in drinks--- that Jean and Thomas's marriage is lacking in some arena that is never quite explored.The absence in the film of Thomas and Jean's daughter, Billie removes a dimension to the plot which would have added irony to the overall outcome---although the movie works well enough without Billie's presence.Jean, intent on the task of photographing the island locale where the murders occurred, becomes obsessed when she discovers a diary written by the murders only witness---a young Norwegian immigrant named Marin. As Jean reads the document, and it plays out for us in multiple visits to the past, we sense a similiarity between the yearning of both characters, past and present.  The movie ends with the same cataclysmic happening that occurs in the book with one very relevant difference and twist of tragedy.I didn't like Sean Penn as Thomas; I envisioned Thomas as a more economic human being who uses poetry to express what he ordinarily could never convey without breaking.  Sean is too large a persona to get across that still-waters-run-deep quality I believe Thomas possessed in the novel.  McCormack portrays an edgier Jean---more frazzled with a cigarette smoking intensity that was unfortunately not softened by the presence of the child.  Hurley too overtly flirtatious---Adaline of the novel was less conscious of her beauty and its ability to seduce--it was more second nature rather than worked.  Sarah Polley undoubtably gets my vote for best player---she emotes without speech--her loneliness is as evident as the lone house against the backdrop of the crashing waves---far from civilization and any real human warmth.Watching this film will certainly provoke some conversational aftermath---and for this I recommend it--even if the conversation that ensues only compares the film with the book.",3,Adequately Captures the Atmosphere of the Novel,1049241600,"04 2, 2003",2003,2790,"['had', ""n't"", 'already', 'read', 'novel', 'Anita', 'Shreve', 'film', 'based', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'switching', 'back', 'forth', 'turn', 'century', 'present', 'offsetting', 'anticipated', 'older', 'story', 'parallel', 'emotions', 'discovery', 'surface', 'modern', 'story', 'found', 'Bigelow', 'technique', 'sufficiently', 'convey', 'story', 'message', 'tone.As', 'book', 'Jean', 'photojournalist', 'married', 'Thomas', 'award', 'winning', 'poet', 'Jean', 'been', 'assigned', 'task', 'photographing', 'environs', 'isolated', 'islands', 'coast', 'Maine', 'New', 'Hamphire', 'where', 'two', 'horrific', 'murders', 'occurred', 'century', 'before', 'Thomas', 'brother-in-law', 'brother-in-law', 'too', 'attractive', 'girlfriend', 'Adaline', 'sail', 'treacherous', 'coastline', 'audience', 'infers', 'foursome', 'moody', 'dialogue', 'flirtatious', 'yet', 'melancholy', 'interplay', 'Thomas', 'Adaline', '-punctuated', 'plenty', 'ice', 'clinking', 'drinks', 'Jean', 'Thomas', 'marriage', 'lacking', 'arena', 'never', 'quite', 'explored.The', 'absence', 'film', 'Thomas', 'Jean', 'daughter', 'Billie', 'dimension', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'irony', 'overall', 'outcome', 'movie', 'well', 'enough', 'Billie', 'presence.Jean', 'intent', 'task', 'photographing', 'island', 'locale', 'where', 'murders', 'occurred', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'when', 'diary', 'written', 'murders', 'only', 'witness', '-a', 'young', 'Norwegian', 'immigrant', 'named', 'Marin', 'Jean', 'document', 'out', 'multiple', 'visits', 'past', 'sense', 'similiarity', 'yearning', 'characters', 'past', 'present', 'movie', 'same', 'cataclysmic', 'happening', 'book', 'one', 'very', 'relevant', 'difference', 'twist', 'tragedy.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Thomas', 'envisioned', 'Thomas', 'more', 'economic', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'poetry', 'express', 'what', 'ordinarily', 'could', 'never', 'convey', 'breaking', 'Sean', 'too', 'large', 'persona', 'get', 'still-waters-run-deep', 'quality', 'believe', 'Thomas', 'possessed', 'novel', 'McCormack', 'edgier', 'Jean', '-more', 'frazzled', 'cigarette', 'smoking', 'intensity', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'softened', 'presence', 'child', 'Hurley', 'too', 'overtly', 'flirtatious', '-Adaline', 'novel', 'was', 'less', 'conscious', 'beauty', 'ability', 'seduce', 'was', 'more', 'second', 'nature', 'rather', 'worked', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'undoubtably', 'vote', 'best', 'player', '-she', 'emotes', 'speech', 'loneliness', 'as', 'evident', 'lone', 'house', 'backdrop', 'crashing', 'waves', '-far', 'civilization', 'real', 'human', 'warmth.Watching', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'provoke', 'conversational', 'aftermath', '-and', 'recommend', 'even', 'conversation', 'only', 'film', 'book']",N/A

Kathryn Bigelow was managed to direct an excellent cast in a well written screenplay based on a novel by Anita Shreve - an exploration by a contemporary set of couples on a weekend excursion to re-address an actual murder of two women that took place on the lonley Isle of Shoals off the coast of New Hampshire in 1873.  The impetus of the investigation is journalist/photographer Catherine McCormack with alcoholic poet husband Sean Penn, Penn's worldy brother Josh Lucas and his current paramour Elizabeth Hurley.  This quartet of strangely interconnected lives  is slowly exposed to the facts of the century old murders through the voice of one of the three women in the fated house who survived.  The island murder site has one lonely house with a history of Norwegian immigrants beset with marital discord, incest, and isolation.  As the real version of the murders unfolds the contemporary couples' similar quirks are revelded.  To say more would deprive the viewer of the keen suspense this spellbinding story holds.  Suffice it to say that with a cast of contemporaries like Catherine McCormack, Sean Penn, Elizabeth Hurley and Josh Lucas and the parallel cast of islanders that includes a wonderful Sarah Polley, Vinessa Shaw and Katrin Cartlidge the suspense and intensity is matched only by the main character of the film - the mighty Atlantic ocean.  Beautifully photographed, the film's only real problem is that the voices are often buried by a lushly orchestrated and sung film score; the music is beautiful but overpowers the actors and pacing of the story. But that said, THE WEIGHT OF WATER  is a fine movie that deserves another go  - and that can now happily happen in your home on a very well made DVD.",4,A fine play within a play,1047340800,"03 11, 2003",2003,1864,"['WEIGHT', 'OF', 'WATER', 'fine', 'story', 'one', 'better', 'examples', 'double', 'stories', 'played', 'flashback', 'released', 'recent', 'years', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'was', 'managed', 'direct', 'excellent', 'cast', 'well', 'written', 'screenplay', 'based', 'novel', 'Anita', 'Shreve', 'exploration', 'contemporary', 'set', 'couples', 'weekend', 'excursion', 're-address', 'actual', 'murder', 'two', 'women', 'took', 'place', 'lonley', 'Isle', 'Shoals', 'coast', 'New', 'Hampshire', '1873', 'impetus', 'investigation', 'journalist/photographer', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'alcoholic', 'poet', 'husband', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Penn', 'worldy', 'brother', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'current', 'paramour', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'quartet', 'strangely', 'interconnected', 'lives', 'slowly', 'exposed', 'facts', 'century', 'old', 'murders', 'voice', 'one', 'three', 'women', 'fated', 'house', 'who', 'survived', 'island', 'murder', 'site', 'one', 'lonely', 'house', 'history', 'Norwegian', 'immigrants', 'beset', 'marital', 'discord', 'incest', 'isolation', 'real', 'version', 'murders', 'unfolds', 'contemporary', 'couples', 'similar', 'quirks', 'are', 'revelded', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'deprive', 'viewer', 'keen', 'suspense', 'spellbinding', 'story', 'Suffice', 'say', 'cast', 'contemporaries', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'parallel', 'cast', 'islanders', 'wonderful', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'Vinessa', 'Shaw', 'Katrin', 'Cartlidge', 'suspense', 'intensity', 'matched', 'only', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'mighty', 'Atlantic', 'ocean', 'Beautifully', 'photographed', 'film', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'voices', 'are', 'often', 'buried', 'lushly', 'orchestrated', 'sung', 'film', 'score', 'music', 'beautiful', 'actors', 'pacing', 'story', 'said', 'THE', 'WEIGHT', 'OF', 'WATER', 'fine', 'movie', 'go', 'can', 'now', 'happily', 'happen', 'home', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'DVD']",N/A

I was overwhelmed by `The Weight of Water.' I guess part of the problem is that the ad campaign seems to have presented it as a thriller, which it's not. It's also not a mystery or a love story. It's a slow-paced, decidedly downbeat look at two women who are trapped in loveless relationships. Basically, it consists of two parts, a modern-day part and a historical part, set in the 19th century. The 19th century part shows promise and actually gives a pretty interesting view of how a mysterious double murder took place, but ultimately it's underdeveloped and I'll have to admit is a bit slow.However, compared to the modern-day part, the 19th century part is sort of Oscar material. But as you watch this film you will notice that the modern-day part seems to rely on two major things: Liz Hurley's breasts and some endlessly drawn out shots and quasi-philosophical conversations which really don't have much of a storyline.Kathryn Bigelow's direction is masterful. She uses images and sounds to express the powerful passions which the two main characters feel but can't express themselves. She gets excellent performances out of the entire cast, but Sarah Polley is especially fine. I'm sure the fact that none of the characters are sympathetic (at least not in the usual sense) is one of the reasons people aren't responding to the film. Bigelow isn't telling a simple story here, and she doesn't want to manipulate the audience by trotting out the usual clich&eacute;s. This is a complicated movie about how complicated love really is.I haven't read Anita Shreves's novel, but I'd like to. I imagine Bigelow was attracted to it because it offered a blunt, unsentimental look at relationships. `The Weight of Water' is not a conventional Hollywood entertainment. If you're open to it, if you throw away your preconceptions, you may be surprised at where this film takes you.",4,Kathryn Bigelow obviously put a lot of care into her direction of this film.,1160092800,"10 6, 2006",2006,1966,"[""'m"", 'absolutely', 'shocked', 'critical', 'reaction', 'movie', 'been', 'so', 'negative', 'was', 'overwhelmed', 'Weight', 'Water', 'guess', 'part', 'problem', 'ad', 'campaign', 'have', 'presented', 'thriller', 'not', 'also', 'not', 'mystery', 'love', 'story', 'slow-paced', 'decidedly', 'downbeat', 'look', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'trapped', 'loveless', 'relationships', 'Basically', 'two', 'parts', 'modern-day', 'part', 'historical', 'part', 'set', '19th', 'century', '19th', 'century', 'part', 'promise', 'actually', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'view', 'how', 'mysterious', 'double', 'murder', 'took', 'place', 'ultimately', 'underdeveloped', ""'ll"", 'have', 'admit', 'bit', 'slow.However', 'compared', 'modern-day', 'part', '19th', 'century', 'part', 'sort', 'Oscar', 'material', 'watch', 'film', 'will', 'notice', 'modern-day', 'part', 'rely', 'two', 'major', 'things', 'Liz', 'Hurley', 'breasts', 'endlessly', 'drawn', 'out', 'shots', 'quasi-philosophical', 'conversations', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'storyline.Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'direction', 'masterful', 'images', 'express', 'powerful', 'passions', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'feel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'express', 'excellent', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'especially', 'fine', ""'m"", 'sure', 'fact', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'least', 'not', 'usual', 'sense', 'one', 'reasons', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'responding', 'film', 'Bigelow', ""n't"", 'telling', 'simple', 'story', 'here', ""n't"", 'want', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'trotting', 'out', 'usual', 'clich', 'eacute', 's.', 'complicated', 'movie', 'how', 'complicated', 'love', 'really', 'is.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Anita', 'Shreves', 'novel', ""'d"", 'like', 'imagine', 'Bigelow', 'was', 'attracted', 'offered', 'blunt', 'unsentimental', 'look', 'relationships', 'Weight', 'Water', 'not', 'conventional', 'Hollywood', 'entertainment', ""'re"", 'open', 'throw', 'away', 'preconceptions', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'where', 'film']",N/A

Sargent ""jesteratsnetnet""","[4, 7]","Stark and uncompromising, this film manages to balance simplistic, but edgy, psychodrama and historical mystery with honest character study.It's refreshing to see Elizabeth Hurley (Adaline) star in an intelligent psychological drama.  Not since her breakthrough performances in KILL CRUISE and PERMANENT MIDNIGHT has the actress been allowed to stretch much farther than glorified eye-candy (not that I'm complaining about that ;)  Unfortunately, she's not much more in this film.  The real stars are Sean Penn as Thomas, an alcoholic and melancholic poet who hasn't picked up pen in years, and Sarah Polley as a Norweigian immigrant (Maren) who struggles with a cold marriage, a desperate secret and a building internal rage that threatens her sanity make this film a winner.Catherine McCormack is excellent as well in the role of Thomas' wife Jean, a photojournalist researching an old murder case from 1873 (the film is based on Kathryn Bigelow's book and the murder on the Island of Shoals actually happened).  She happens upon new evidence that calls into question the official explanation of the crime and reveals the powerful fury of violent emotions that sometimes overtake good people and move them to acts of horror.  In the midst of her discovery, she must confront her own passion, disappointment, jealousy and frustration.Both stories are tightly woven through a complex parallel narrative.  The cinematography is at times artistic and elegant and at others pale and unrefined.  The ending is a bit forced and the storm scene seems contrived, but if the viewer can excuse the final 13 minutes of the film, the initial 100 feature performances that border on virtual genius.The only lead that fails as a character lacking any depth whatsoever is Rich (played by Josh Lucas), Thomas' brother and Adaline's beau.  There is more personality in a wooden pencil.  Further, the viewer waits for the ... tension between both Penn and Hurley's characters, and likewise Lucas' and McCormack's, to materialize beyond innuendo, but the film falls short of providing such powerful impetus for a rage that is, one supposes, meant to be mirrored by Nature's furious rampage near the end of the tale.Overall the film is thought-provoking and holds the viewer's interest, but it lacks in depth beyond the obvious and suffers from predictable cliche' development throughout.  This is forgivable, though.  The tightly filmed narrative paces along rapidly and the interior struggles that the characters endure expose the reality of human frailty.  One fairly touching scene occurs between Polley's character and that of Anethe (played by Vinessa Shaw).  Therefore, it must be said that throughout, this is Polley's film.I rate it four/five and suggest KILL CRUISE (or DER SKIPPER) (starring Hurley, Patsi Kensit and J&uuml;rgen Prochnow) as a decent companion picture.  Fans of Polley's work should also see NO SUCH THING.  Cheers!",4,Hurley - just eye-candy.

Well, as our protagonist digs deeper and deeper into the old crime, she begins to lose control on reality, seeing herself in the same situation as one of the possible killers from the unsolved mystery.Good acting and a story that slowly engulfs.

733644,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0000844LS,Lawyeraau,"[18, 23]","This is an adaptation of the  exceptionally well-written book of the same name by Anita Shreve.  The film, as does the book, tells two stories, each with its own voice, demanding to be heard. The stories run parallel to each other, and the film cuts back and forth between each one, a difficult thing to do successfully. The director, Karen Bigelow, handles the flashbacks with competent ease. One story takes place in the present, and the other takes place over a century ago. The film is not a faithful adaptation of the book, and the revisions  somewhat  undercut the tension in the present day story, weakening that portion of the film. Moreover, while the casting for the period segment is perfect, the casting of the present day story leaves much to be desired.The film tells the present day story of Jean (Catherine McCormack),  a news photographer who sets out on a large sailboat to a remote island off the coast of New Hampshire, accompanied by her Pulitzer prize winning writer/husband, Thomas (Sean Pen),  her brother-in-law, Rich (Josh Lucas), and his sexy girl friend of several months, Adaline (Elizabeth Hurley). It turns out that Thomas and Adeline already knew each other, as Thomas had introduced her to his brother, a fact of which Jean had been previously unaware. It appears that relations may be strained on this voyage, as Adeline flirts outrageously with Thomas. Jean's present is haunted by passion, jealousy, and betrayal. She feels great angst, as she senses the attraction that seems to exist between her husband and Adeline.The purpose of the visit to the island is to view the scene of a nineteenth century double murder that saw two Norwegian, immigrant women hacked to death, which murders were much ballyhooed at the time as the crime of the century. A third woman, Maren Hontvedt (Sara Polley), survived the carnage that took the lives of her sister and sister-in-law and lived to tell the tale. It seems that a former boarder returned to their homestead, while the husbands of two of the women were away, and attacked them. He was caught, charged, tried, convicted and, proclaiming his innocence to the end, executed for his crimes.Jean later discovers an uncatalogued statement made by the lone surviving eyewitness, Maren Hontvedt, which recounts  Maren's life and  the events that led up to the carnage. It reveals what actually happened. The period segment reveals that while Maren's marriage is not a love match, she is, nonetheless, doing everything she can to make a home. When her relatives arrive from Norway, they revive past issues best left dormant. Jean begins to identify with Maren's struggles with love and marriage. Ultimately, It is through Maren's compelling story that Jean finds herself able to come to term with her own personal tragedy.Alternating between Jean's unraveling present and the secrets of the past, the film provides an absorbing and suspenseful narrative, as it tries to tell the two stories. It is in the period piece that the film succeeds, however, painting a wonderful picture of what Maren's life  was like over a century a go on that isolated island. Sarah Polley is terrific as the tragic Maren and the cinematography is magnificent. It is the period story, painting the picture of nineteenth century immigrant life, that carries the film, as it is that story that is the most compelling.  The two juxtaposed dramas each come together, however, in a primal and tragic climax.The present day story, unfortunately sinks under its own weight. Sean Penn in the role of Thomas gives a performance that makes the viewer want to slap him, so obnoxious and pretentious does he come across. He is all but laughable and so unattractive as to make one wonder what the gorgeous Adeline could ever see in him. Elizabeth Hurley is well cast as the slyly flirtatious Adeline. Josh Lucas is likable as Rich, Jean's good looking  brother-in-law. Unfortunately, the anorexic looking Catherine McCormack is also not particularly likable as Jean. One begins to think that she and Thomas deserve each other. Moreover, the viewer cares little about what happens to either one of them, so unlikable are they.The present day story deserves about  two stars, while the period segment deserves at least a four, so I am rating this film with three stars.

While I was convinced that Thomas drowns, my wife thought he didn't; so any film that leaves you with that large of a plot hole sinks from the weight of editing.&quot;The Weight of Water&quot; was introduced in 2000 at the Toronto film festival and then not released for 2 years.  Katherine Bigelow who has directed &quot;Point Break&quot; and &quot;K-19: The Widowmaker&quot; with Harrison Ford does a good job of filming two parallel stories, although they don't really have any relationship to each other.The actors do turn in some interesting performances and are a joy to watch even if the film doesn't completely make sense.  British actress Catherine McCormack who was so memorable in Mel Gibson's &quot;Brave Heart&quot; and also appeared in &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot; with Meryl Streep and &quot;The Tailor of Panama&quot; gives an edgy performance as photographer Jean Janes whose marriage is on the ropes.  She does a splendid job of being attracted to her husband, her brother-in-law, being frigid, and worrying about her husband's attraction to the oh-so-topless Adaline playing with an ice cube on the deck of the boat.  Perhaps a tad less nervous, this is the type of performance that Jane Fonda used to nail.Elizabeth Hurley who gained fame as Hugh Grant's girlfriend while he was cruising the streets, gives a seductive, albeit one-note performance, as a poet groupie.Sean Penn didn't add to his 3 Oscar nominations (&quot;Dead Man Walking,&quot; &quot;Sweet &amp; Lowdown,&quot; &quot;I Am Sam&quot;) with this film, but does an interesting job of portraying a troubled poet with a haunted past.Josh Lucas isn't as memorable as he was in &quot;Sweet Home Alabama,&quot; nor does his performance have neither the meat of &quot;An Incredible Mind&quot; nor the entertainment value of &quot;The Hulk.&quot;  However, he looks great on the boat and seems to have some emotional variety in the scene where he swims out to check on his sister-in-law.The past story that is edited back and forth with the present also boasts some interesting performances.  Most notable is Sarah Polley as Maren who appeared in the very confusing beauty &amp; the beast-type tale &quot;No Such Thing.&quot;  I don't know what she'll have to do in the upcoming &quot;Dawn of the Dead,&quot; but here she gives a multifaceted performance as the lonely, isolated wife of a fisherman who was banished from her home for getting a bit too close to her brother.  The scene where she also gets a bit too close to her brother's wife played by Vinessa Shaw who got a bit too close to Tom Cruise in &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is an eye opener.The late Katrin Cartlidge does an excellent job as the straight-laced judgmental sister Karen who should've kept her mouth shut and winds up as one of the 2 corpses.  Ulrich Thomsen plays husband John Hontvendt is a less than memorable role.  Danish soap star Anders W. Berthelsen plays Maren's beloved brother.  Irish actor Ciaran Hinds from &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover&quot; plays Louis Wagner who is accused and executed for the murders.This is an interesting film to watch for the performances, although the editing and the ending may leave you scratching your head to figure out what went on.

733647,AKEJE0HB5BST0,B0000844LS,Mark Lee,"[3, 3]","This film tells two stories.  The first, a murder mystery occurring in what appears to be 19th century New England in an immigrant community.  The second, the story of two couples - brothers played by Sean Penn and Josh Lucas with, respectively wife (Catherine McCormack) and girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) - on a short holiday somewhat casually investigating the matter as they sail around the locale.  The timelines are well demarcated cinematically through color and sound (with a couple of odd cuts), and this film will appeal to fans of the neo-noir/mystery genre, as well as folks who like to watch Elizabeth Hurley walk around barely clad.  There are some interesting relationships between the past and present storylines, well-filmed parallel stormy crescendos, and some worthy dialogue (such as the extended conversation between McCormake and Hurley about Penn's character).I liked Mccormack as Penn's troubled photographer wife.  She and Ciaran Hinds as the creepy accused murderer in the flashbacks were the bright spots in this film for me.  Sarah Polley put in a typically good effort as a gray, twisted, perpetually disappointed young bride in a hard new world.  Hurley was hired to ooze naughtiness in this film, and that's what she did by sucking and nibbling on every small object at hand and stroking herself so much that I'd have expected a related rash or friction burn.  Was Penn's character an ogling, self-obsessed, unlikeable poet or a grand, tortured poet-soul?  ""Talent excuses cruelty.""  Josh Lucas just sort of handsomely floated around the periphery of the troubled threesome for most of the film, and Vinissa Shaw floated through the middle of the earlier timeline as Polley's naive and very sweet sister-in-law.In the end, there were lots of moments that I liked, but the whole thing left me with a few unscratched itches and that feeling that, like a few of the characters, I'd been quickly diddled and then left alone.",3,"Weighty, and Watery.

This movie, however, fails to really do that.  The murder mystery set in 1870s New Hampshire is riveting, and Sarah Polley is marvelous as young Maren, the woman caught up in a double murder.  Ciaran Hinds is also very good as the accused boarder who is sentenced to death for the crimes.  Unfortunately, the present day storyline is so muddled and weakly performed that we never fully understand how the two storylines could ever possibly tie together.  Sean Penn gives one of his worst performances in this film, having no energy or conviction in his role; Elizabeth Hurley tries to look sexy, and succeeds, but who is this woman?  Catherine McCormack doesn't help matters, with her self-absorbent performance, and only Josh Lucas in a throwaway role as Penn's brother redeems himself.

The thing that stops this film from raising above the merely good and talented fray is that the two tales are unbalanced.  Though the modern day tale of Sean Pean as a writer, his wife as a photojournalist, Josh Lucas as Penn's brother, and a deliciously played coy Elizabeth Hurley as Lucas' girlfriend and a literary groupie to Penn makes for complicated interactions played interestingly by a fine cast, it simply does not live up to the history behind the mystery.The two tales are attempted to be interwoven but aren't connected skillfully like similar cinematic anachronistic parallel tales like ""The Hours.""

I am putting the performance Sarah Polley gives here in my all-time greats pantheon. This, my friends, is an actress to be reckoned with.I have yet to read Anita Shreve's book. I will be after watching this movie. And while I usually prefer the written word to film adaptations, I am fearful that there will be nothing on the page that will be able to hold a candle to the fierce and wounded performance of Ms. Polley.As Maren, Sarah Polley--more than any other actress or actor I have ever seen--captures our universal and very human need for love. Even more brilliant: she does this from moment one of the performance but conceals it until a pivotal moment later in the movie. She has, through her performance, truly breathed life into this character.Through most of the movie she alternates between a relatively to extremely unlikable character. Yet when she arrives at her weakest moment, at what some might argue is her most vile moment, I found her totally sympathetic and heart-breaking.This is acting that gives us a true glimpse into a character. By extension it lets us more clearly see ourselves.While there are things about this movie that I do not care for (I really don't care all that much for anyone on the boat except maybe the brother...hence the four stars), there is no performance that I could ever recommend more highly than the one Sarah Polley turns in here.

So why does it seem like a Lifetime Original Movie(TM) on steroids?Jean Janes (Shadow of the Vampire's Catherine McCormack) is obsessed with a pair of murders that occurred on the Isles of Shoals in 1873, when Louis Wagner (Rome's Ciaran Hinds) was convicted of the murders of two women and executed. Jean isn't sure they got the right person. She and her poet husband Thomas (Sean Penn) set off for the islands on a boat with Thomas' brother Rich (Josh Lucas, recently of Poseidon) and Rich's new girlfriend Adaline (Elizabeth Hurley, who went from this right on to film Bedazzled). The interpersonal relationships on the boat cause tensions to flare, as everyone seems to want pretty much everyone else, and the situation on the boat brings Jean to a possible revelation of an alternative theory of the crime.It's an interesting premise, and from everything I've heard it's carried off quite successfully in the book, which I haven't read. But oh, it doesn't work well at all in the film. The links between the two stories are shown only by the way the two stories are intercut; no work at all was done on trying to parallel the two in any structural way. Most of the actors are wasted here; even the vastly talented McCormack seems only a shadow of her usual irrepressible self, while Sarah Polley, whose story takes place over in the nineteenth century time frame, seems as if she's worn down by a lot more than inimical primitive island life. About the only actor who's really effective here is Hinds, who plays his role to the hilt.It's not the worst movie I've seen in the past month, but it's pretty close. **",2,Wow-- it's impressive how much of a mess this is.,1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,1826,"['Weight', 'Water', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', '2000', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'production', 'adaptation', 'Anita', 'Shreve', 'novel', 'directed', 'Near', 'Dark', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'starring', 'handful', 'big-name', 'actors', 'So', 'why', 'seem', 'Lifetime', 'Original', 'Movie', 'TM', 'steroids', 'Jean', 'Janes', 'Shadow', 'Vampire', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'obsessed', 'pair', 'murders', 'occurred', 'Isles', 'Shoals', '1873', 'when', 'Louis', 'Wagner', 'Rome', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'was', 'convicted', 'murders', 'two', 'women', 'executed', 'Jean', ""n't"", 'sure', 'got', 'right', 'person', 'poet', 'husband', 'Thomas', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'set', 'off', 'islands', 'boat', 'Thomas', 'brother', 'Rich', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'recently', 'Poseidon', 'Rich', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Adaline', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'who', 'went', 'right', 'film', 'Bedazzled', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'boat', 'cause', 'tensions', 'flare', 'everyone', 'want', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'situation', 'boat', 'Jean', 'possible', 'revelation', 'alternative', 'theory', 'crime.It', 'interesting', 'premise', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'carried', 'quite', 'successfully', 'book', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'oh', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'film', 'links', 'two', 'stories', 'are', 'shown', 'only', 'way', 'two', 'stories', 'are', 'intercut', 'work', 'was', 'done', 'trying', 'parallel', 'two', 'structural', 'way', 'Most', 'actors', 'are', 'wasted', 'here', 'even', 'vastly', 'talented', 'McCormack', 'only', 'shadow', 'usual', 'irrepressible', 'self', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'story', 'place', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'time', 'frame', 'worn', 'down', 'lot', 'more', 'inimical', 'primitive', 'island', 'life', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'really', 'effective', 'here', 'Hinds', 'who', 'role', 'hilt.It', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'past', 'month', 'pretty', 'close', '**']",N/A
733656,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0000844LS,Roland E. Zwick,"[42, 49]","**1/2 In its basic structure and format, ""The Weight of Water"" is very similar to the far more impressive film ""Possession"" from 2002.  In both movies, we get two different stories running simultaneously: one, a mystery set in the past, and, the other, a personal drama located in the present, involving a group of characters reflecting on and trying to make sense of the events that took place a century or so earlier.The story-within-a-story in ""The Weight of Water"" is a true-life account of a brutal double murder that took place on a remote island off the coast of New Hampshire in the 1870's.  Two out of the three women who were on the island that fateful night fell victim to the murderer, with the third escaping and fingering a man - a former boarder - as the culprit.  The man was convicted and hanged for the offense, yet, more than a century later, a shadow of doubt hangs over the verdict.  One of the modern-day doubters is Jean Janes, a photographer who ventures to the island to do a shoot of the location, only to find herself strangely obsessed with uncovering the truth about the case.  Accompanying her on her quest are her husband, Thomas, a celebrated poet; Rich, his handsome brother whose boat they use to get to the island; and Adaline, the latter's gorgeous girlfriend who also happens to be a devotee of Thomas' literary work and a bit of a ""groupie,"" as it turns out, in both tone and temperament, attaching herself rather obviously to the talented young bard, despite the fact that his observant wife is on the boat with them.  As in ""Possession,"" the filmmakers in this film - screenwriters Alice Arlen and Christopher Kyle and director Kate Bigelow - shift constantly between the past and the present, allowing us to piece together the clues as to what really happened on that island over 130 years ago, and, at the same time, to examine the strained relationships among those contemporary figures looking for the answers.The problem with ""The Weight of Water"" - as it is in many films with this dual-narrative structure - is that one story almost inevitably ends up dominating over the other.  Certainly, both tales seem to want to make the same unified point:  that love and passion are often such overwhelming forces in our lives that they can end up destroying us in the process.  How often do luck, fate, personal demons or societal pressure force us to compromise those elemental passions raging within our hearts, leading us, ultimately, to all the wrong choices and wrong partners that we end up having to live with for the rest of our lives?  This is certainly the case in the part of the story set in the past where loneliness, regret, even incest and lesbianism play a crucial part in what happens to the characters.  We can understand what motivates these individuals to do what they do, since their hungers, needs and intentions are cleanly laid out and clearly defined.The same, unfortunately, cannot be said for the outer story set in the present.  These characters lack the necessary delineation to make us truly understand where they are coming from or to make us care where they are going.  Catherine McCormack does a superb job as Jean, capturing the fears, jealousies and anxieties of this insecure modern woman, but the screenplay doesn't let us into her mind enough to show us what is really going on beneath the surface.  We know that she is unhappy in her marriage, but we never really get to know why.  The situation is not helped one bit by Sean Pean who barely registers an emotion in the crucial role of Jean's husband.  Apart from the fact that he seems to be brooding all the time, we never get the sense that Thomas could really be the world-class poet we are told he is.  As Adaline, Josh's tawny-haired girlfriend, Hurley looks great in her bikini, of course, but the character is little more than the stereotypical temptress placed there by the writers to serve as a source of strain and tension on the marriage.  The movie also builds to a mini- ""Perfect Storm""-type climax that seems forced, phony, arbitrary and all too convenient and, worst of all, fails to make the connection between the two narratives clear and comprehensible.  The final scenes seem strained at best, as the authors attempt to bring all the disparate elements together - but to no real avail.  The fact is that the filmmakers never make their case as to why we should find any kind of meaningful parallels between the characters and events in the two stories.  The characters in the past are obviously hemmed in by the repressive society in which they live so we give them a little leeway and offer them our sympathy; the characters in the present, with so many more options open to them, just come across as whiney and self-pitying and we find ourselves growing more and more impatient with them (all except Jean, that is) as the story rolls along.""The Weight of Water"" wants to be an important and meaningful film, but only one half of its story truly earns those adjectives.",2,half a good film,1059696000,"08 1, 2003",2003,5018,"['**1/2', 'basic',

The flaws of the film pertain to it's rigid desire to maintain a parallel structure in it's two separate (yet connected) stories. The one story feels very original and fresh (though come to find out it is roughly based on a tragedy some 100 years before). But the other feels forced into an attachment with the primary narrative.

This from my perspective was the downfall to this movie that had plenty to work with the history combined with the research being done by Jean (Catherine McCormack). Jean (the photo journalist) with the help of her husdand Thomas (the writer) (Sean Penn) who enlists his brother Rich (Josh Lucas) who's sailboat boat they use for their seaside base camp for Jean's research into the 1873 murders. The three are joined by Rich's girlfriend Adaline (the hot antagonist distraction) (Elizabeth Hurley) who seems to either of had an affair or wants to have one with Thomas and the two are the antagonists for the present day story. As you can imagine there is plenty of tension between the two couples (in the cramped quarters of the sailboat) while Jean is doing her research and again it serves as more of a distraction to this story than a correlation between the people involved then and now.  There are a few scenes throughout and near the end that can be considered a link to the killers actions/emotions in 1873 and Jean's actions/emotions. I really liked what was presented as the possible motive for the murders of the two women in 1873 that was so taboo back then as well as it is today. It negates the current story of the two couples like in a Massive Tsunami Wave kinda way.

733661,A3T2GFSCZVUAP7,B0000844LS,"S. Wetzel ""music /movie fan""","[4, 7]","Whew!  After reading other reviewer's remarks, I'm glad to see I was not the only one who thought this movie was crap.  The cinematography is great, and the look (art direction) is authentic.  I too had trouble following the double-storyline.  Just when I started to get interested in the modern-day story, the action cut back to the past.  I don't know if it was poor choices during the editing processes or what.  I have seen many other movies that use flashback and dual-timeline stories.  None of those were this boring.  By the time you get to discover the real truth behind the century-old murders, you really don't care anymore.  And I don't see how the climactic storm at sea resolves the modern-day storyline.In terms of casting, I have to agree with the other reviewers: why cast two British actress as the modern-day leads.  To me, the character of Jean should've been played with either an American actress (or at least a British or Australian actress with an American accent)instead of Catherine McCormick.  I also couldn't begin to identify with the character.  She seems so obsessed over this murder but completely inarticulate when discussing it (unless that's the point).  Sean Penn sits around and broods as her husband, a has-been poet.  Josh Lucas and Elizabeth Hurley (as Sean Penn's brother and the brother's girlfriend) really don't have much to do except add some eye candy (Josh for the ladies, and Elizabeth for the guys, and believe me, I kept wanting to see more of her in the bathing suit -- with and without the top).  Some say Josh Lucas's acting is a bit wooden and stiff in this role; I say he has nothing to work with: the character is just there to steer the boat and give Hurley backrubs.  He has no real personality quirks and Lucas works best when he plays someone who's a bit flawed (he is a rare case of a character actor who has leading-man good looks but bland roles don't suit him).  Sean Penn, on the other hand, looks like he's sleepwalking through half the movie.  His alcoholic poet seems more like he's stoned on Prozac; there's no passion, even when he quotes Dylan Thomas.  I think this was a miscasting; he's not sympathetic either.  (SPOILER ALERT: His character's fate during the storm is almost deserved; one cannot feel sympathy for him.)The story set in the last century is much more interesting but because of the cut-up flashbacks, one doesn't hold interest.  Sarah Polley is a good actress, but her moping around -- ""Oh, I'm stuck in a loveless marriage, and I really want to sleep with my brother again,"" attitude gets old.  Yes, dear viewers, I gave away another spoiler: incest. The other actors that play in the murder mystery story (aside from Polley and the great Ciaran Hinds as the wrongly accused murderer) are all Scandinavian and I've never heard of any of them before.  They do a good job with the material they're given, but it's hard to connect with them as well.Perhaps this is one of those movies that you grow to like after repeated viewings.  Once was enough for me.  Perhaps you also need to read the original Anita Shreve novel before you watch it.  If so, I understand the movie is quite the literal adaptation.  This may be its biggest flaw: novels can be cinematic in their themes, imagery and their dialogue; they become water-logged when one tries to adapt the same style in telling two contrasting stories.  It also helps that when reading a novel with two story lines, it's much easier to go back and re-read parts of it, when the action gets confusing.",2,Water-logged,1116806400,"05 23, 2005",2005,3539,"['Whew', 'reading', 'other', 'reviewer', 'remarks', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'crap', 'cinematography', 'great', 'look', 'art', 'direction', 'authentic', 'too', 'had', 'trouble', 'following', 'double-storyline', 'Just', 'when', 'started', 'get', 'interested', 'modern-day', 'story', 'action', 'cut', 'back', 'past', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'poor', 'choices', 'editing', 'processes', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'use', 'flashback', 'dual-timeline', 'stories', 'None', 'were', 'boring', 'time', 'get', 'discover', 'real', 'truth', 'century-old', 'murders', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'anymore', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'climactic', 'storm', 'sea', 'modern-day', 'storyline.In', 'terms', 'casting', 'have', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'why', 'cast', 'two', 'British', 'actress', 'modern-day', 'leads', 'character', 'Jean', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'played', 'American', 'actress', 'least', 'British', 'Australian', 'actress', 'American', 'accent', 'instead', 'Catherine', 'McCormick', 'also', 'could', ""n't"", 'begin', 'identify', 'character', 'so', 'obsessed', 'murder', 'completely', 'inarticulate', 'when', 'discussing', 'point', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'around', 'broods', 'husband', 'has-been', 'poet', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'brother', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'add', 'eye', 'candy', 'Josh', 'ladies', 'Elizabeth', 'guys', 'believe', 'kept', 'wanting', 'see', 'more', 'bathing', 'suit', 'top', 'say', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'acting', 'bit', 'wooden', 'stiff', 'role', 'say', 'nothing', 'work', 'character', 'just', 'there', 'steer', 'boat', 'give', 'Hurley', 'backrubs', 'real', 'personality', 'quirks', 'Lucas', 'best', 'when', 'someone', 'who', 'bit', 'flawed', 'rare', 'case', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'leading-man', 'good', 'looks', 'bland', 'roles', 'do', ""n't"", 'suit', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'other', 'hand', 'sleepwalking', 'movie', 'alcoholic', 'poet', 'more', 'stoned', 'Prozac', 'passion', 'even', 'when', 'Dylan', 'Thomas', 'think', 'was', 'miscasting', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'either', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'character', 'fate', 'storm', 'almost', 'deserved', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'story', 'set', 'last', 'century', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'cut-up', 'flashbacks', 'one', ""n't"", 'hold', 'interest', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'good', 'actress', 'moping', 'around', 'Oh', ""'m"", 'stuck', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'really', 'want', 'sleep', 'brother', 'again', 'attitude', 'old', 'Yes', 'dear', 'viewers', 'gave', 'away', 'spoiler', 'incest', 'other', 'actors', 'play', 'murder', 'mystery', 'story', 'Polley', 'great', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'murderer', 'are', 'Scandinavian', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'material', ""'re"", 'given', 'hard', 'connect', 'well.Perhaps', 'one', 'movies', 'grow', 'like', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'Once', 'was', 'enough', 'Perhaps', 'also', 'need', 'read', 'original', 'Anita', 'Shreve', 'novel', 'watch', 'so', 'understand', 'movie', 'quite', 'literal', 'adaptation', 'may', 'be', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'novels', 'can', 'be', 'cinematic', 'themes', 'imagery', 'dialogue', 'become', 'water-logged', 'when', 'one', 'adapt', 'same', 'style', 'telling', 'two', 'contrasting', 'stories', 'also', 'when', 'reading', 'novel', 'two', 'story', 'lines', 'much', 'easier', 'go', 'back', 're-read', 'parts', 'when', 'action', 'confusing']",N/A

733666,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000844LS,Tsuyoshi,"[22, 26]","(Let me say first that my rating is actually about 2.5, but I could not do that, so made it 3.)  I had a chance to watch this film based on a novel by Anita Shreve (which I haven't read), and was interested in the names of the cast including Sean Penn, and the director Kathryn Bigelow.  I am sorry to say that the entire film, though it has some intriguing premise and fantastic photography, somehow fell short of my expectation.  But I don't know how you will receive this film, so I concentrate on writing factual aspects of this one.  Let me hear your own opinions from you on Amazon later.Some sources call ""The Weight of Water"" a thriller, but that is misleading.  It is more like a drama with some psycological depth.  ""The Weight of Water"" has two plots side by side, one set in today, the other in the past.  The film follows both the mystery of the horrible ax murder in the past, and hidden envy or hatred between the apparently friendly travellers today, with each story interwoven together.The film (or the book, I should say) is based on an actual double murder case that happened on the Isles of Shoals, off the coast of New Hampshire, in 1873.  The introductory part of the film reveals us that a couple of female immigrants from Norway were killed, and a man called Lewis is arrested.  But as the sole survivor and witness Maren (Sarah Polley, most unlucky girl in ""GO"") recounts her story to us, complicated things leading up to the fatal night slowly reveals unexpected side to us.Meanwhile, the other story concerns the four members on board, crusing in a yacht off the coast of the Isles: photographer Jean (underrated Catherine McCormack, in ""Braveheart"" and ""Spy Game""), her husband and celebrated poet Thomas (Sean Penn), his brother Rick (Josh Lucas), and Rick's new girlfriend Adeline (Elizabeth Hurley).  Jean is assigned to take photos about the murder case in 1873, and she is gradully obcessed with investigating the truth behind the case.  But as she gets closer to the facts, the relations between the four members on board stars to falter, opening both the channel for the undercurrent enmity, and the wounds that should have been healed long ago.The double plot concept sounds good, but does not seem to be working well.  It depends on your view, but I thought these too many details thrown in the film look so disjointed that the film fails to keep them tight, making the whole work look very confusing.  The murder story is developed, generating our interest adequet for watching, thanks to Sarah Polley's convincing acting, but her character, with all credible complexity, suffers from so many flashbacks and story-within-story structure.  It is a shame because she is really good, as is McCormack, whose character Jean, with her unconsciously sneaking loneliness, is phychologically (or supernaturally) connected with tormented Maren's life (so it is implied).  With more stress on the aspect of the relation between them, the film could be more accessible and involving.  Overall, acting is good, but, you know, when did Sean Penn provide us with bad acting?Director Bigelow's trademake photography, making full use of light and darkness, is here again, and her cutting-edge cinematography that raised her past works one notch higher can be seen this time.  However, I must say that her known weakness in handling the story also damages the film, as in the past.  The last sequence about the storm coming to the yacht off the Isles (this ""Perfect Storm""-like climax set in today corresponds with the re-enactment of deadly night 130 years ago) looks very contrived, inspite of the tactful editing.Now, I said what I wanted to say.  I also point out that this was produced by Studio Canal (France), and made before the Harrison Ford film ""K-19"" directed by Bigelow.  I give three stars, but I must confess that I was disappointed after seeing this twice.",3,A Phychological Drama that Is Inspired by Actual Murder,1029542400,"08 17, 2002",2002,3892,"['Let', 'say', 'first', 'rating', 'actually', 'about', '2.5', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'made', '3', 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Anita', 'Shreve', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'was', 'interested', 'names', 'cast', 'including', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'director', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'am', 'sorry', 'say', 'entire', 'film', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'fantastic', 'photography', 'somehow', 'fell', 'short', 'expectation', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'will', 'receive', 'film', 'concentrate', 'writing', 'factual', 'aspects', 'one', 'Let', 'hear', 'own', 'opinions', 'Amazon', 'later.Some', 'sources', 'call', 'Weight', 'Water', 'thriller', 'misleading', 'more', 'drama', 'psycological', 'depth', 'Weight', 'Water', 'two', 'plots', 'side', 'side', 'one', 'set', 'today', 'other', 'past', 'film', 'mystery', 'horrible', 'ax', 'murder', 'past', 'hidden', 'envy', 'hatred', 'apparently', 'friendly', 'travellers', 'today', 'story', 'interwoven', 'together.The', 'film', 'book', 'should', 'say', 'based', 'actual', 'double', 'murder', 'case', 'happened', 'Isles', 'Shoals', 'coast', 'New', 'Hampshire', '1873', 'introductory', 'part', 'film', 'reveals', 'couple', 'female', 'immigrants', 'Norway', 'were', 'killed', 'man', 'called', 'Lewis', 'arrested', 'sole', 'survivor', 'witness', 'Maren', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'most', 'unlucky', 'girl', 'GO', 'story', 'complicated', 'things', 'leading', 'up', 'fatal', 'night', 'slowly', 'reveals', 'unexpected', 'side', 'us.Meanwhile', 'other', 'story', 'concerns', 'four', 'members', 'board', 'crusing', 'yacht', 'coast', 'Isles', 'photographer', 'Jean', 'underrated', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'Braveheart', 'Spy', 'Game', 'husband', 'celebrated', 'poet', 'Thomas', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'brother', 'Rick', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Rick', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Adeline', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'Jean', 'assigned', 'take', 'photos', 'murder', 'case', '1873', 'gradully', 'obcessed', 'investigating', 'truth', 'case', 'closer', 'facts', 'relations', 'four', 'members', 'board', 'stars', 'falter', 'opening', 'channel', 'undercurrent', 'enmity', 'wounds', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'healed', 'long', 'ago.The', 'double', 'plot', 'concept', 'good', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'working', 'well', 'view', 'thought', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'thrown', 'film', 'look', 'so', 'disjointed', 'film', 'keep', 'tight', 'making', 'whole', 'work', 'look', 'very', 'confusing', 'murder', 'story', 'developed', 'generating', 'interest', 'adequet', 'watching', 'thanks', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'convincing', 'acting', 'character', 'credible', 'complexity', 'suffers', 'so', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'story-within-story', 'structure', 'shame', 'really', 'good', 'McCormack', 'character', 'Jean', 'unconsciously', 'sneaking', 'loneliness', 'phychologically', 'supernaturally', 'connected', 'tormented', 'Maren', 'life', 'implied', 'more', 'stress', 'aspect', 'relation', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'accessible', 'involving', 'Overall', 'acting', 'good', 'know', 'when', 'did', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'provide', 'bad', 'acting', 'Director', 'Bigelow', 'trademake', 'photography', 'making', 'full', 'use', 'light', 'darkness', 'here', 'again', 'cutting-edge', 'cinematography', 'raised', 'past', 'one', 'notch', 'higher', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'time', 'However', 'must', 'say', 'known', 'weakness', 'handling', 'story', 'also', 'damages', 'film', 'past', 'last', 'sequence', 'storm', 'coming', 'yacht', 'Isles', 'Perfect', 'Storm', '-like', 'climax', 'set', 'today', 'corresponds', 're-enactment', 'deadly', 'night', '130', 'years', 'ago', 'very', 'contrived', 'inspite', 'tactful', 'editing.Now', 'said', 'what', 'wanted', 'say', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'was', 'produced', 'Studio', 'Canal', 'France', 'made', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'film', 'K-19', 'directed', 'Bigelow', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'must', 'confess', 'was', 'disappointed', 'seeing', 'twice']",N/A
