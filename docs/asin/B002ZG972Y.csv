The detail that goes into the plot, character development, and animation is nothing but the best.  Unfortunately, Alpha and Omega isn't from the studio that gave us Buzz, Nemo, or Dug the Dog.  That's not to say it's a bad movie.  Just that its an `also ran'.The plot is harmless enough.  Kate and Humphrey are members of the same pack, but not of the same social standing.  Kate is an Alpha - a hunter and leader, driven and trained to be the very best.  Humphrey is a good-natured and loveable goofball who pals around with his buddies, rising to the occasion whenever absolutely necessary.  Sadly, Humphrey - an Omega - has feelings for Kate, and that's not just going to fly when it comes right down to pack law.  Think Romeo and Juliet for the Wild Kingdom set.But when the pair of wolves gets tranquilized and relocated hundreds of miles from home, the journey back gives them a chance to discover each other.  Sadly, the journey just doesn't live up to its potential.  You can see each plot development coming from a mile off.  We're also subjected to numerous jokes involving bodily functions and butts.Hayden Panettiere and Justin Long do a passable job as the star crossed Kate and Humphrey.  Dennis Hopper and Danny Glover also turn in decent efforts as the senior statesmen of the Wolf community.

Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere""","[3, 20]","I know this was made for little kids, but the messages it instills in their little formulative, impressionable brains is just plain terrible.  This is a movie about wolves, but it overtly teaches children it's perfectly alright to be judgemental, superficial, arrogant, violent human beings.Kate is the cool, proud, strong, sophisticated Alpha wolf that is responsible and dutiful.  Humphrey is the lovable loser Omega wolf that spends his time joking and playing around.  Hump likes Kate, but she ridicules and looks down upon him.  Any friendship between the two would not be tolerated.  Instead Kate is expected to hook up with Garth, another stud Alpha wolf from a rival pack.  Their marriage will supposedly unite the packs and end the pointless feuding so all the wild dirty dogs could chomp on some yummy caribou together.This basic, uninspired script is not really a problem.  Arranged marriage?  Primitive, but hey they are wolves.  The constant wolf bickering and fighting is pointless, but it does accurately reflect human nature.  It's also no big deal that the wolves get frightened by a pack of caribou and are forced to eat berries and cupcakes.What I found preposterous and harmfully derogatory was the divisive mindset portrayed here.  Even when captured by hunters and expected to repopulate a national park, Kate looked at Humphrey with contempt and disgust.  She refused to go slumming and give it up to the loser wolf.  That right there teaches girls it's okay not to do their duty and spread 'em.  Wrong on so many levels.Alpha and Omega had so many howling bad lines and silly developments.  The visuals are pretty bland as well.  Plus a basic story you've seen a hundred times before, mixed with negative messages to brainwash our kids.  Am I overreacting?  Yes.

1300561,A1BFO0O2FT0O3T,B002ZG972Y,"Chancie ""Chance""","[3, 6]","""Alpha and Omega"" looked pretty cute to me. I've always enjoyed the movies geared towards kids, and I'm a little ashamed to admit that I love movies with the talking animals. When I saw previews for this, I knew I'd have to see it, especially with my love for wolves.However, on its own, ""Alpha and Omega"" falls a little bit...well, flat.The premise is two rival wolf packs who want to unite and end the battle between them by marrying their two Alpha wolves together. The only problem is that Kate (one of the Alphas) and childhood friend Humphrey (Omega, lowest ranking) are kidnapped together and driven all the way from Canada to Idaho for a national park. From there, they have to get back home before the packs go to war, all while learning about love, trust, friendship, etc. along the way.And that's really all there is to the story.It's cute, don't get me wrong, but it's extremely basic and simple. From seeing just the trailer alone, you could pick out how many particular events in the movie play out. And even for the parts that don't involve the trailer, they're still predictable, and they use aspects that have been seen before in children movies (such as mistaking someone for dead, and they turn out not to be).Not to mention, you can see the ending coming from a mile away.It felt like it was trying to be a Disney movie, driving home on all of these sentimental messages, but just didn't quite make it. And really, the messages were practically screaming and so in-your-face that it felt like a little too much.However, I found it interesting that the howling in the movie is actually considered ""singing."" When the wolves howl, they don't hear howling. They hearing singing, and if you can ""sing well,"" then it was the same as having that deep emotional wolf howl.Clever idea, but it took me a little bit to catch on to it.Now, let me say that it's not a bad movie. It's just a simple movie. It's clearly meant for the kids and that's about it. I always love when kids' movies also have the parents in mind, who have to sit through it, and I love when they throw in a few jokes here and there to keep the older audience entertained. Unfortunately, you won't find that here.

1300563,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG972Y,Chris Pandolfi,"[17, 27]","""Alpha and Omega"" is a cute, harmless, disposable animated film, something the kids may enjoy during its ninety-minute run but then forget about as soon as they get home. I appreciated it from a technical standpoint - the animation is decent, the color scheme is vivid, the vocal performances are competent - but I didn't get all that much out of the story or the characterizations, both of which are a little too innocuous for my taste. Not to sound presumptuous, but I suspect I speak for the majority of adult audiences, who will no doubt dutifully take their children to see it. In all fairness, far worse children's films have been made (I'm talking to you, the people behind ""Furry Vengeance"" and ""Standing Ovation""). It's not so much that ""Alpha and Omega"" is bad; it's just that it's awfully by-the-numbers.It tells the story Kate (voiced by Hayden Panettiere) and Humphrey (voiced by Justin Long), two wolves living in Canada's Jasper National Park. Even though they're from the same pack and like each other, they're separated by social status; Kate is an alpha - a hunter, a leader, well trained, committed to responsibility - whereas Humphrey is an omega - goofy, playful, responsible for nothing apart from breaking up the occasional fight. According to the laws, dictated by Kate's father (voiced by Danny Glover), alphas and omegas can be friends, but they can never be mates. She can only be with another alpha. Low and behold, such a wolf is Garth (Chris Carmack), the son of Tony (voiced by the late Dennis Hopper), the leader of a rival pack. To prevent the two packs from going to war, it's decreed that Garth and Kate will marry.Matters are complicated when Kate and Humphrey are tranquilized by rangers and sent to an Idaho wildlife preserve, apparently in an attempt to repopulate the area with wolves. They soon cross paths with a golf enthusiast and his caddy, the former a French-Canadian goose (voiced by Larry Miller), the latter a British duck (voiced by Eric Price); with their help, Kate and Humphrey escape the preserve and begin the journey home. It's a surprisingly uneventful trip. There are only two real exciting moments. One occurs during a rainstorm, when Humphrey has to save Kate from falling into a canyon by swinging in on a vine. The other is when Humphrey and Kate escape from angry bears by sliding down a mountain in a halved and hollowed log. Everything else that happens to them is barely worth mentioning. Mostly, they just dance around the issue of being in love with one another.As far as the basic plot is concerned, that's pretty much all there is to say. All we have left are the personality quirks of the side characters, who, in the tradition of even the best animated films, thoroughly upstage anything done by the leads. Garth, for example, is the canine equivalent of a mimbo - a fitness buff and ladies man who couldn't howl properly even if his life depended on it. (Not that anyone really howls in this movie; if anything, they harmonize, as if performing the backup sections of a love ballad at a karaoke bar.) And then there's Kate's mother, Eve (voiced by Vicki Lewis), whose pleasant, wholesome voice belies a shocking tendency to threaten others with throat ripping and eye gouging. Kate's sister, Lilly (voiced by Christina Ricci), is a soft-spoken omega who has a thing for Garth, in spite of the laws forbidding it.I suppose I should mention that the film is presented in 3D, although in this day and age, it's becoming less and less necessary to point that out. Regardless, the filmmakers did everything they could to take advantage of the process. Rocks that act as golf balls zoom directly at the camera. So do lunging wolves and splashes of water. It seemed most prominent during the film's first twenty minutes, at which point I kept noticing a juvenile fixation on rear ends. Perhaps directors Ben Gluck and Anthony Bell are the kind of guys that think butts are inherently funny. Or maybe they understood that many children, their sense of humor still in development, are easily amused by that particular part of the body. Whatever the case, I was glad when they finally eased up on the references. Personally, I think faces are a lot funnier. Yes, even in 3D.If there is, in fact, a theme or message, it rests solely on the idea of Opposites Attract. Even then, there isn't all that much to go on, mostly because it isn't explored in any meaningful way. The best we're given, apart from the obvious inclusion of the alphas and omegas, is the pairing of a big, burly motorcycle enthusiast and a petite, matronly librarian; they drive a trailer and listen to heavy metal while wearing novelty sunglasses. I grant you it makes for a few amusing visuals, but that's about it. The bottom line: ""Alpha and Omega"" is an adequate way to keep the kids out of the house for a little while, but I seriously doubt it will be remembered ten years down the line. It follows a formula and follows it well, and while that may not be much of a compliment, it's the best I can do.",3,Two Wolves Learn That Opposites Attract,1285027200,"09 21,

1300565,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002ZG972Y,C. Sawin,"[8, 15]","Is it just me or is it weird seeing Lionsgate distribute an animated film theatrically? Lionsgate is pretty much known for distributing R-rated horror (it's responsible for both Saw and Hostel) and even some martial arts flicks (The Forbidden Kingdom and The Transporter series). While they have released animated films in the past like Happily N'Ever After and family films such as Akeelah and the Bee, Alpha and Omega still feels like a really awkward fit for the studio. The problem with animated films Lionsgate releases is that they always have this direct to DVD quality to them and that is most likely the first thing you'll notice about Alpha and Omega.There are so many animated films out there that are so completely dull, lifeless, and lacking emotion and inspiration. Alpha and Omega is all of these things and corny right from the starting line. Animals usually fall into a certain rank; the alpha is at the top while the omega picks up the scraps at the bottom. The alpha tends to be the leaders, get to eat first, have choice of prey, choose their mates, etc. The omegas are the followers and eat last. In Alpha and Omega, the alpha wolves are apparently like flashy jocks and the omega wolves are the carefree frat boys who care about nothing more than having fun. You know those stupid dance-off movies? ""I'm going to break-dance with a poor girl even if you don't like it to help battle your brain cancer and save that burning orphanage!""  This is kind of like that. An alpha never associates itself with an omega! Well grandpa, get off your dinosaur because they do now.The lameness doesn't stop there though. There's a slow motion sequence at the beginning of the movie that seems to sort of spoof The Matrix except it's two wolves. That can talk. Defying gravity. For no reason. The jokes are beyond stale, as well. There's a scene where a hunt for caribou goes wrong and the wolves are on the receiving end of a caribou stampede. After it dies down, the alpha wolves are getting the short end of the stick and the omega wolves step in to break up the scuffle. At one point, an omega wolf named Humphrey (Justin Long) points out that the caribou are laughing at them. A group of caribou is shown flashing their tales at the wolves to which Humphrey replies, ""That's a moon even I don't want to howl at."" Speaking of Humphrey, the entire film seems to be an excuse for him to complain about his butt or his tail or anything in that general vicinity.Canada is also apparently a place to find empty tree carcasses at the most convenient at times. Hollowed-out tree trunks are used as luges a good half a dozen times in the movie and are usually the reason a catastrophe is avoided. The musical segments in the film came off as lazy. Whenever a wolf howls at the moon they sing, but there are never any lyrics. It's nothing more than a variation of ""ooo's"". Throw in the weird rip-off instrumentals from Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" and you've got something really peculiar on your hands. The French-Canadian goose who's obsessed with golf and his duck caddy that is also a chiropractor came off as a little more than unnecessary. They're given an ounce of character and a few quirks and they do nothing more then tell the main characters information they probably could've figured out on their own. The whole experience is just very disheartening.Want to hear something that's really going to make this depressing? This is Dennis Hopper's last film. His final role was wasted on a cranky wolf with back problems. If it wasn't for the fact that this was labeled as his last role or the dedication at the end of the movie, this lifeless character wouldn't be memorable at all.Alpha and Omega is a pretty forgettable animated feature. The animation is underwhelming, the voice cast is fairly lifeless (but who can blame them with the material they were given?), and the storyline is really just run-of-the-mill fluff. It's also kind of a travesty that this movie has to be labeled as Dennis Hopper's last performance. While this may be fun for some children, it'll be a lethargic trip for adults.

But after watching it a few times, it really grew on me and has become a personal favorite.  Granted, the animation is not up to par with Dreamworks or Pixar, but it's still pretty decent.  I guess I was a little disappointed at first that the wolves didn't all look that wolf-like, but after watching the &#34;making of&#34; documentary, they said that their goal wasn't for super realism, but more like caricatures of wolves - looking at it from that perspective, I got to like it a little more.  (Besides, even the characters in Pixar movies look more like caricatures of the animals they're supposed to be - such as the &#34;Madagascar&#34; characters).  Anyway, I like the way that they intertwined the idea of relocating wolves to other parks to start new packs into an animated feature, since wolf relocation to establish new packs is something that has been done in real life.  And I was just glad to (finally) see a movie, especially an animated movie, that portrays wolves in a positive light - something that has been far too lacking in any genre, since there is so much misinformation and animosity towards wolves.  One of the only things in the film that I thought was silly was the howl-singing of the wolf characters, but even that kind of grew on me after a while.  Kate and Humphrey are such great characters, as are Lilly and Garth.  Some of the humor will definitely go over kids' heads, but that's something that can be said of most of these CGI animated movies.

El-Hewie""","[7, 14]","The artist carved his masterpiece with packs of wolves, caribous, birds, grizzly bears, forests, mountains, steam train, full moon, and plenty of wolves howling styles.Each element blended gracefully in an old fashion narration of love, family, marriage, and unity for the good of the whole. From the remote forests of Idaho and Canada, to the remote cultures of tribal marriage that strengthens the bonds between families, to the intriguing elements of nature such as mud slides and downhill skiing, to the stampedes of caribous that frighten ferocious wolves, the movie touches on the issue of real love founded on genuine choice.The alpha wolf, Kate, was struck with two choices. One, was uniting the packs and marrying the alpha wolf, Garth, which would have pleased their fathers, Toni and Winston. Two, Kate already experienced the fun and joy of the omega wolf Humphrey during their capture and dislocation ordeal. Kate dared to go against her father's wish and chose the omega wolf, which engulfed the wolf packs into war.Fortunately, for Kate, the forest took care of its own inhabitants. As the packs of wolves engaged in rage and fight, the birds were sacred, which alerted the caribous to stampede. The stampeding caribous brought greater dangers on the wolves, which forced them to cease fighting.Humphrey was also fortunate to have missed the train in his effort to break away from the pack. Both Kate and Humphrey were presented with one in life time opportunity to save their elderly wolves from the stampede of the caribous.The wolves' love story ended peacefully with Kate marrying Humphrey, and Lilly marrying Garth.  Both were mixed marriages between alphas and omegas.At the end of the movie, the different artistic elements were displayed to represent the basics thoughts that gathered in the artist's mind in the making of the movie. The howling of two stranded wolves, befriended by two two birds, on the background of train wheels knocking the rail transitions, added extra sense of serenity to the milieu.Living the peaceful and tranquil nights in an open train car, zipping through the Rocky mountains and valleys, under the majesty of open space, full moon, and captivating nature, were the best experience the viewers will enjoy by sitting in a movie theater.

I really don't get how some good movies go to dvd while others like this go to the theaters. It's a kind of movie that a parent would bring their child to, only to yawn themselves to sleep while their little child claps and screams out ""daddy, daddy! Look at the woof woof!"" (replace daddy with mommy if you're a mom). The only age that'll appreciate this would be ages 1 through maybe 8?It makes me just embarrass just to be seen watching this, definitely not for serious dates, even if you just want a easygoing laughable movie, this is not the one to choose. It has a lot of childish humor. Embarrassing to watch scenes include wolves howling like they're singing, which made me cringe and shut my eyes, praying that it'd go away.This is a lower budget animation. I'm a gaming/animation major, but it doesn't take someone in gaming or animation major to tell you that the animation is of lower caliber to something like...Ice Age for example. The film I found was boring, the humor was not very amusing to my taste, the plot has been overdone (Romeo and Juliet variety), animation was alright but definitely nothing special and definitely not revolutionary. Humor involving the mom, nice try but didn't go through, it was too corny.I skipped through many parts of the movie because I just couldn't take anymore mediocre/bad films, it's a bit overwhelming. This is why pirating has gone up and the movie industry wonders why? Better movies and lower movie prices please.Cute movie, but leave it to the young kiddies. The movie is definitely not universally entertaining and if you're an adult that gets lots of laughs from this, either you're on multiple medications which you should have prescribed me a couple of OR you have a brain of a 5 year old, which I don't find surprising.The rating system on amazon is near worthless as well....

1300592,A3BAGKMJFQCJAQ,B002ZG972Y,Nicholas Jarak,"[1, 1]","Alpha & Omega is not bad, but not great either.Overall:The movie has some funny moments, and it was quite cute at times. I'm a 23 year old guy, and I found some parts of it to be pretty funny, and I really liked the cute moments. I also really liked the CG art style of the film, but at times it suffers from rather mediocre animation. The story and characters are okay, but they are a little lacking. Honestly, this is a movie that you'll probably enjoy watching for a bit, but won't remember very long because it doesn't do a fantastic job on anything except for it's style (it really does have an endearing style, though).Animation:The movie's CG effects had a very stylized look to it that was reminiscent of cell-shading at times due to the bright color palette. This works out pretty well because it has a very unique look to it. Sometimes the backgrounds even ended up looking like paintings. Overall, I liked it. The characters looked pretty good, and quite cute at times, but the character models seemed a bit basic at times. The animation of the characters was pretty mediocre. Most of the time it looked pretty good, but there were quite a few times that I felt that the movements felt a little stiff or awkward.Story:The story is pretty simple. I must say that some of the character reactions did surprise me a little because they deviated a bit from my expectations (which is a good thing). But, for the most part, the story was unsurprising and bland. Most of it didn't really evoke much emotion. It almost feels like this story could have been told in 30 minutes, but then the plot element of the wolves being kidnapped was thrown in to lengthen the story without adding much valuable material to the film. The biggest issue I had with this story was the lack of tension. The climax of the film felt more like a fizzle because the tension was missing. Some this is an issue with the animation because the movements of the characters always seemed to lack urgency even when the situation called for it. Everyone seemed to move at a slow, uninteresting pace, even when they were trying to be quick about it. It left you feeling like there was no urgency to anything even when the rest of the film was trying to setup a moment of great tension. Truthfully though, the main problem is with the story. It's not necessarily bad. It's just longer than it should have been so it feels like everything is dragged out. Honestly, 30 minutes (maybe 45) would have been plenty of time to tell this story. The most redeeming element of the story was the ending. Even though it was predictable, and I already knew what was going to happen, I still got a little teary eyed.Accuracy:There isn't much. Don't expect this movie to feel like watching the lives of wolves because it feels nothing like that. It's inaccuracies are all over the place. One should go into this film ready to suspend disbelief, otherwise, the inaccuracies may be a little distracting if not confusing at times. Just forget everything you know about wolves and imagine that this is just some kind of society with a completely different social order. There are a couple moments that may be a bit confusing, but it's pretty easy to catch on to most of it. For example, apparently in this so called ""wolf"" society, being a vegetarian is the equivalent of being ugly. I can see where the writers got the idea since wolves are primarily carnivores, but the joke confused me for a second because it was an odd association to make.Characters:The characters are okay. Humphrey is actually kinda funny at times. Interestingly enough, at one point, I actually disliked the main female wolf (Kate) for a little bit because at one point in the movie, she shows herself to be incredibly shallow. I actually liked her sister more because she was a more interesting character (humble and shy). I was watching the film hoping that things would work out well for the sister even though she was only a secondary character. The other side characters were had their moments that were pretty entertaining also. The mother's crazy and borderline scary personality was quite fun to watch (even if it seemed a bit out of place at times). The father was about as a boring as can be. He's basically a ""insert generic chief/leader archetype here"". My main issue with some of the characters was that it was obvious that at times that the writers were trying to evoke certain reactions from the audience with some of the character's actions, but a there were a few times where it just fell flat. It leaves you thinking, ""Okay... I see what you are trying to do there, but it didn't work."" Or sometimes, you have no idea what the writers were trying to achieve, and it just comes off as awkwardly random.",3,Not bad and Cute,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,4745,"['Alpha', 'Omega', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'either.Overall', 'movie', 'funny', 'moments', 'was', 'quite', 'cute', 'times', ""'m"", '23', 'year', 'old', 'guy', 'found', 'parts', 'be', 'pretty', 'funny', 'really', 'liked', 'cute', 'moments', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'CG', 'art', 'style', 'film', 'times', 'rather', 'mediocre', 'animation', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'okay', 'are', 'little', 'lacking', 'Honestly', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'bit', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', 'very', 'long', ""n't"", 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'anything', 'style', 'really', 'have', 'endearing', 'style', 'though', '.Animation', 'movie', 'CG', 'effects', 'had', 'very', 'stylized', 'look', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'cell-shading', 'times', 'due', 'bright', 'color', 'palette', 'out', 'pretty', 'well', 'very', 'unique', 'look', 'backgrounds', 'even', 'ended', 'up', 'looking', 'paintings', 'Overall', 'liked', 'characters', 'looked', 'pretty', 'good', 'quite', 'cute', 'times', 'character', 'models', 'seemed', 'bit', 'basic', 'times', 'animation', 'characters', 'was', 'pretty', 'mediocre', 'Most', 'time', 'looked', 'pretty', 'good', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'felt', 'movements', 'felt', 'little', 'stiff', 'awkward.Story', 'story', 'pretty', 'simple', 'must', 'say', 'character', 'reactions', 'did', 'surprise', 'little', 'deviated', 'bit', 'expectations', 'good', 'thing', 'most', 'part', 'story', 'was', 'unsurprising', 'bland', 'Most', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'evoke', 'much', 'emotion', 'almost', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', '30', 'minutes', 'then', 'plot', 'element', 'wolves', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'was', 'thrown', 'lengthen', 'story', 'adding', 'much', 'valuable', 'material', 'film', 'biggest', 'issue', 'had', 'story', 'was', 'lack', 'tension', 'climax', 'film', 'felt', 'more', 'fizzle', 'tension', 'was', 'missing', 'issue', 'animation', 'movements', 'characters', 'always', 'seemed', 'lack', 'urgency', 'even', 'when', 'situation', 'called', 'Everyone', 'seemed', 'move', 'slow', 'uninteresting', 'pace', 'even', 'when', 'were', 'trying', 'be', 'quick', 'left', 'feeling', 'was', 'urgency', 'anything', 'even', 'when', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'setup', 'moment', 'great', 'tension', 'Truthfully', 'main', 'problem', 'story', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'just', 'longer', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'everything', 'dragged', 'out', 'Honestly', '30', 'minutes', 'maybe', '45', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'plenty', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'most', 'redeeming', 'element', 'story', 'was', 'ending', 'Even', 'was', 'predictable', 'already', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'still', 'got', 'little', 'teary', 'eyed.Accuracy', ""n't"", 'much', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'feel', 'watching', 'lives', 'wolves', 'nothing', 'inaccuracies', 'are', 'place', 'One', 'should', 'go', 'film', 'ready', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'otherwise', 'inaccuracies', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'distracting', 'not', 'confusing', 'times', 'Just', 'forget', 'everything', 'know', 'wolves', 'imagine', 'just', 'kind', 'society', 'completely', 'different', 'social', 'order', 'are', 'couple', 'moments', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'confusing', 'pretty', 'easy', 'catch', 'most', 'example', 'apparently', 'so', 'called', 'wolf', 'society', 'being', 'vegetarian', 'equivalent', 'being', 'ugly', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'writers', 'got', 'idea', 'wolves', 'are', 'primarily', 'carnivores', 'joke', 'confused', 'second', 'was', 'odd', 'association', 'make.Characters', 'characters', 'are', 'okay', 'Humphrey', 'actually', 'kinda', 'funny', 'times', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'one', 'point', 'actually', 'disliked', 'main', 'female', 'wolf', 'Kate', 'little', 'bit', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'be', 'incredibly', 'shallow', 'actually', 'liked', 'sister', 'more', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'humble', 'shy', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'hoping', 'things', 'would', 'work', 'out', 'well', 'sister', 'even', 'was', 'only', 'secondary', 'character', 'other', 'side', 'characters', 'were', 'had', 'moments', 'were', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'also', 'mother', 'crazy', 'borderline', 'scary', 'personality', 'was', 'quite', 'fun', 'watch', 'even', 'seemed', 'bit', 'place', 'times', 'father', 'was', 'about', 'boring', 'can', 'be', 'basically', 'insert', 'generic', 'chief/leader', 'archetype', 'here', 'main', 'issue', 'characters', 'was', 'was', 'obvious', 'times', 'writers', 'were', 'trying', 'evoke', 'certain', 'reactions', 'audience', 'character', 'actions', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'where', 'just', 'fell', 'flat', 'thinking', 'see', 'what', 'are', 'trying', 'do', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'sometimes', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'writers', 'were', 'trying', 'achieve', 'just', 'off', 'awkwardly', 'random']",N/A
1300593,AHF97M45JFCB,B002ZG972Y,ONENEO,"[2, 2]","It&#8217;s been almost 3-years to the day since the film&#8217;s DVD release (1/11/2011) that I finally dug through my animated film queue deep enough to give Alpha and Omega its due.  The reason for the delay? Well for one, abundant negative reviews surrounding this piece.  A quick search reveals no shortage of critics, professional and amateur alike, willing to slam this movie in just about every conceivable unit of measurement.  Yet despite the criticisms, Alpha and Omega just continues plugging along.  Nowhere was this reality more abundant than when this past October a direct-to-DVD sequel was released (A Howl-iday Adventure) with word that Alpha and Omega 3: The Great Wolf Games (2014), Alpha and Omega 4: The Legend of the Saw-Tooth Cave (2014) and Alpha and Omega 5: Family Vacation (2015) were going to follow.Five-part CG films put this series in very exclusive company as, after all, even blockbusters like Pixar&#8217;s Toy Story has only gone three and DreamWorks&#8217; Shrek and Blue Sky&#8217;s Ice Age have reached the golden number of four (not including spin-offs and shorts).  Clearly, despite critical disappointment, the film has been deemed powerful enough to warrant continued support, a fact made even clearer by three franchise books by Scholastic as well as several licensed video games at present.So why all the attention you wonder?  In short it was a box office success through and through.  The film hit 2,625 theaters via Lionsgate with an estimated budget of $20-mil.  By the time it finished its theatrical run, it had grossed $50,507,267.  That&#8217;s not even taking into account DVD, Blu and licensing revenue.  As a result Alpha and Omega earns the prestigious honor of being the most successful film to date from Lionsgate or India&#8217;s Crest Animation, the two companies responsible for the film&#8217;s creation.All that being said, Alpha and Omega tells the tail er I mean tale of two young wolves in Canada's Jasper National Park: Humphrey (Justin Long) and Kate (Hayden Panettiere). The latter is an alpha, being groomed for leadership and hunting prowess while the former is one of the ragtag omegas; the good hearted and funny members of the group known more for riding logs down the wooded hillside than leading the pack. With hunting territory hanging in the balance, their pack faces a challenge from the encroaching Eastern wolves. In an effort to unite the packs and thus prevent war between the two, alpha Winston (Danny Glover) has promised the hand, er I mean paw in marriage of his eldest daughter, Kate, to the son of Eastern leader Tony (Dennis Hopper).Despite Tony&#8217;s son Garth (Chris Carmack) being a bit of a meat head, not to mention a terrible howler to boot, the plan goes to pot when park rangers tranquilize and relocate Kate (along with Humphrey) to Idaho to repopulate Sawtooth National Forest as apparently we foolish humans are completely unaware of the laws governing wolves whereby alphas and omegas are prohibited from mating, or as it&#8217;s referred to here, &#8220;howling together&#8221;.The core of the tale centers on Humphrey and Kate&#8217;s attempts to return to their home while the two wolf packs teeter on the brink of all out territory war.The screenplay for this one was written by Steve Moore; the guy responsible for the much clunkier Open Season 2 and there are more than a few passing similarities between the two pieces.  Among these talking canines, oblivious humans, stowaways in motorhomes, slight themes of environmentalism and so on.However, unlike Open Season 2, Alpha and Omega carries much better plot momentum and, as is apparently requisite for animation to succeed in theaters these days, a few musical numbers of varying degrees of attainment.I actually came away from this film quite pleasantly surprised and a little bewildered by the pattern of negativity surrounding it.  While it&#8217;s true that it lacks the big-budget eye candy of your modern day Pixar or DreamWorks CG feature (or the complexly layered humor of say Illumination&#8217;s Despicable Me franchise), what is here is 88-minutes of cute entertainment with a  perfectly cast vocal cast and a charming/ distinct art style to boot.  While it&#8217;s true that the film takes very few chances and introduces nothing new to the genre, it&#8217;s hardly as flawed as many similarly budgeted CG pieces jamming up the Redbox these days- particularly those that are actually foreign films with an English dialog track slapped on.At the end of the day, going in with low expectations certainly helps to appreciate Alpha and Omega for what it is but, as I can safely affirm, leaving it sitting on your DVD shelf for three years is certainly overkill.",4,Better Than the Negative Reviews Would Have You Suspect,1392681600,"02 18,

Two wolves that are unable to ""be"" together get captured and relocated to another park halfway across the country.  They set out for home with help from some very funny friends.  Being a kids movie not much really to review, (except my kids really liked it).  For the adults who watch this I really found it to be a metaphor for a class based system of the haves and have-nots.  I may have read too much into it, but it makes a good point of love conquering all, no matter who or what you are.  Deep enough?  There were some really funny scenes in this but it is definitely a kids movie.  Adults won't be totally bored, but don't expect ""Shrek"" type humor in this.
