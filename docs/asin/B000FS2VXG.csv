The Elric Brothers have experienced so much in their long trip of searching for the Philosopher's Stone. They were kind-hearted and helped many people, they were faithful and solved many problems, they were strong and conquered many difficulties. What's more, they loved and trusted each other so much! ""They will get the happiness they deserve at last."" I thought. But the ending made me so sad. Edward renounced his arm and leg that were back for bringing his brother back, and himself was sent to another world, separated from his younger brother Alphonse and people he loved so much. And Alphonse began his long trip of looking for his elder brother.The Elrics held on to the principle of ""Equivalent Exchange"", that's why they tried so hard for the Philosopher's Stone. But what they got at last? Separation, I think. I think it's not fair at all! When I saw Edward and Alphonse on the trains, in 2 different world of course, held up their hands to the sky on the same time, my tears fell, because of their separation, and also because of being moved by their strong faith.I think this is not the ending, it's another beginning. And I saw the hope of opening the door according to the brothers' faith. I'm expecting the reunion.",5,Sorrowful ending.

The author decided that she wants the anime to end differently.  So she got her wish.Anyway, Edward and Alphonse are at the end of the line.  Dante wants to transfer to Rose's body so she can attain youth.  But to switch bodies, Dante needs the Philosopher's Stone, or in this case, Alphonse.  Edward gets into the underground city for one last fight.  Edward learns more and more as he gets deeper into the city.  What is alchemy really?  What is behind Equivalent Exchange?  If Hohenheim and Dante had an affair, if they lived for 1,000 years wouldn't that mean-.  All of the questions before this disc are answered as Edward meets his old man again but in a  much different way then last time.  The homonculi and the military are also apart of this final battle as our favorite Colonel puts his life on the line to expose Bradley for what he really is.  I won't spoil anything pass this point.The Good: Amazing art, music score, the story still goes on, a satisfying moral and cliffhanger is given.The Bad: It's all filler, not exactly engaging, the disc is the same price as the previous discs when it has less episodes, the show continues into a movie.",3,"To Be Blunt, It Wasn't Good Enough",1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,1232,"['anime', 'had', 'gotten', 'ahead', 'manga', 'had', 'gone', 'making', 'fillers', 'author', 'decided', 'anime', 'end', 'differently', 'got', 'wish.Anyway', 'Edward', 'Alphonse', 'are', 'end', 'line', 'Dante', 'transfer', 'Rose', 'body', 'can', 'attain', 'youth', 'switch', 'bodies', 'Dante', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'case', 'Alphonse', 'Edward', 'underground', 'city', 'one', 'last', 'fight', 'Edward', 'more', 'more', 'deeper', 'city', 'What', 'alchemy', 'really', 'What', 'Equivalent', 'Exchange', 'Hohenheim', 'Dante', 'had', 'affair', 'lived', '1,000', 'years', 'would', ""n't"", 'that', 'mean-', 'questions', 'disc', 'are', 'answered', 'Edward', 'old', 'man', 'again', 'much', 'different', 'way', 'then', 'last', 'time', 'homonculi', 'military', 'are', 'also', 'apart', 'final', 'battle', 'favorite', 'Colonel', 'life', 'line', 'expose', 'Bradley', 'what', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'pass', 'point.The', 'Good', 'Amazing', 'art', 'music', 'score', 'story', 'still', 'satisfying', 'moral', 'cliffhanger', 'given.The', 'Bad', 'filler', 'not', 'exactly', 'engaging', 'disc', 'same', 'price', 'previous', 'discs', 'when', 'less', 'episodes', 'show', 'movie']","Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 13: Brotherhood Episodes 49-51"

As Ed races to save Al, he finally faces his greatest challenge - an inevitable, to-the-death battle with the psychotic, androgynous shapeshifter Envy - that even his love for Al might not help him win this time.Although loose ends are left for the movie which follows, alot is wrapped up, particularly Mustang's storyline and the shocking revealation of exactly why the mere mention of any of the Elrics, especially the boys' father, throws Envy (who has some of the volume's most memorable moments) into an unspeakable rage.

(And I do love the movie.) But the story of FMA is just like nothing else I have ever watch or will watch. The animation was always breathtaking the voice talent was the best out there.

Ed catches up with Dante, who wants to use Al the Philosopher's Stone as the means to transfer her soul to Rose's body. That's if the varying motivations of the Homunculi don't get in the way. And Ed finally learns the secret of the black gate he saw when he lost his arm and leg and Al lost his whole body, and he also discovers where it leads! Their mentor Izumi does battle with the new cyborg weapon version of Archer, who has been programmed to serve Dante and the Homunculi's commands without question. Meanwhile, Mustang shows up at King Bradley's house to pay a cordial visit full of fire!All in all, Fullmetal Alchemist ranks as one of the greatest anime series ever made. But this last volume comes up a little short because its true resolution is left for the movie version. I just don't see the point in leaving such a big hole at the end like Volume 13 did. It seemed needlessly exploitive of the fans who will now have to buy another dvd to get the end. The secret behind the gate also left me a bit underwhelmed going ""That's it?"". The point I did like about these last episodes is that at one point Dante tries to dismiss the whole equivalent exchange theory as a human's wishful thinking. To her, the rule was a made-up maxim to self-impose limits upon the power of alchemy. Taking it further, she takes the existentialist viewpoint that there is no higher moral law controlling the universe and that it is basically left to chance. In other words, there is no justice. But the ""good guys/gals"" in Fullmetal Alchemist try their best in this volume to defeat this lack of ideals and prove that evil eventually gets its punishment.",3,GOOD VS.
