1639727,AJJ2YKN4BG2FC,B00BVMXBDO,"Accidental Tourist ""Maryam M""","[11, 15]","BBC America's new proffering takes me back to my Lost fangirl days of reading way too much into every little fictional thing, but then coming out of the frenetic fan-research with some actual thoughtful content to mull over. It's profoundly written, acted and executed. For those coming off of the Lost or Fringe waves, this series will sweep you right back off your feet.Orphan Black's subject matter delves into the mysterious and exciting world of fringe science's cloning endeavor. Our protagonist, Sarah Manning, should not exist. But by whatever miracle of Sciences-That-Should-Not-Be, she does. But this isn't a story about one woman. This is a story about several whose resemblances begin and end at their faces. The clones of Orphan Black are separate and distinct characters amazingly brought to life in what could only be described as a Herculean acting feat accomplished by lead actress Tatiana Maslany. Alongside her charismatic foster brother Felix (Jordan Gavaris), and a host of supporting characters (several portrayed by Maslany) with their own tall tales and complex relationships, Sarah is suddenly made aware of the bizarre nature of her existence, and in lieu of a mixture of necessity and natural curiosity, begins to pull back the pages of her life. With each turn of the chapter --or in this case, packed episode -- the plot thickens. And watching it unfold is a most excellent way to spend your Saturday.I feel as though like the creators of Orphan Black have dipped generously from Aldous Huxley's Brave New World in crafting the premise of the show, and it's good if they have, being that Huxley's book is such mind-blowing and spooky material. There are easter eggy references to the author, so chances are that they actually have! To me, it's books and shows like these that define what true science fiction is. Science fiction isn't just all robots and mind control. It asks often bizarre but often important questions about absolutely everything. It digs deep into the ""maybe""'s of life, and procures the unusual, the fantastic, the surreal and unreal.With any luck, this series will last as long as Lost or Fringe did. It certainly deserves to.",5,Could Someone Clone This Show?,1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,2177,"['BBC', 'America', 'new', 'proffering', 'back', 'Lost', 'fangirl', 'days', 'reading', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'little', 'fictional', 'thing', 'then', 'coming', 'frenetic', 'fan-research', 'actual', 'thoughtful', 'content', 'mull', 'over', 'profoundly', 'written', 'acted', 'executed', 'coming', 'off', 'Lost', 'Fringe', 'waves', 'series', 'will', 'sweep', 'right', 'back', 'feet.Orphan', 'Black', 'subject', 'matter', 'mysterious', 'exciting', 'world', 'fringe', 'science', 'cloning', 'endeavor', 'protagonist', 'Sarah', 'Manning', 'should', 'not', 'exist', 'miracle', 'Sciences-That-Should-Not-Be', ""n't"", 'story', 'one', 'woman', 'story', 'several', 'resemblances', 'begin', 'end', 'clones', 'Orphan', 'Black', 'are', 'separate', 'distinct', 'characters', 'amazingly', 'brought', 'life', 'what', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'Herculean', 'acting', 'feat', 'accomplished', 'lead', 'actress', 'Tatiana', 'Maslany', 'Alongside', 'charismatic', 'foster', 'brother', 'Felix', 'Jordan', 'Gavaris', 'host', 'supporting', 'characters', 'several', 'portrayed', 'Maslany', 'own', 'tall', 'tales', 'complex', 'relationships', 'Sarah', 'suddenly', 'made', 'aware', 'bizarre', 'nature', 'existence', 'lieu', 'mixture', 'necessity', 'natural', 'curiosity', 'pull', 'back', 'pages', 'life', 'turn', 'chapter', 'case', 'packed', 'episode', 'plot', 'thickens', 'watching', 'unfold', 'most', 'excellent', 'way', 'spend', 'Saturday.I', 'feel', 'creators', 'Orphan', 'Black', 'have', 'dipped', 'generously', 'Aldous', 'Huxley', 'Brave', 'New', 'World', 'crafting', 'premise', 'show', 'good', 'have', 'being', 'Huxley', 'book', 'such', 'mind-blowing', 'spooky', 'material', 'are', 'easter', 'eggy', 'references', 'author', 'chances', 'are', 'actually', 'have', 'books', 'define', 'what', 'true', 'science', 'fiction', 'Science', 'fiction', ""n't"", 'just', 'robots', 'mind', 'control', 'often', 'bizarre', 'often', 'important', 'questions', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'deep', 'maybe', 'life', 'unusual', 'fantastic', 'surreal', 'unreal.With', 'luck', 'series', 'will', 'last', 'as', 'long', 'Lost', 'Fringe', 'did', 'certainly']",Orphan Black: Season 1

1639731,ATHNYP7D3RW1A,B00BVMXBDO,A. Gavin,"[0, 0]","Lately, there have been a lot of shows  using the device of twins borrowing identities. Perhaps it's a trend, perhaps it's just a fan fave, as Shakespeare himself went for it in Comedy of Errors and Twelfth Night. In any case, Orphan Black up the ante. Not twins or triplets, but human clones. And there are at least seven of them. Plus, it's better than last years duplicate thrillers: Ringer (as much as i'm a SMG fan) and The Lying Game (which is pretty good in a lightweight way).What is crazy impressive about Orphan is that Canadian actress Titiana Maslany (Shakespeare reference right there in her name!) manages to pull off wildly distinct personalities was incredible aplomb. I mean, seriously, you can just feel the different presence of these girls. You can even see quite effectively when one of them is pretending to be another. Watching uptight suburban mom Allison pretending to be punk Sarah is hilarious -- and effective.This show is Science Fiction, but the SF is confined to the clone thing and it's low budget too. There aren't a ton of effects. What there is, however, is very good writing, casting, acting, and pacing. It's a great show really. We can't know that the quality will survive into later seasons, but this one is break neck. The characters are sympathetic and interesting, and boy is she(s) put through the ringer (sorry SMG). The tone is simultaneously dark and comic, but always tense and unpredictable. There is one bit in the pilot where Sarah (playing Beth) is caught in an impossible situation. She goes to the bathroom to buy herself some time, then does something completely unexpected that actually works as a clever solution. This is very effective thriller plotting. It doesn't feel forced or overwrought but merely tense.Importantly, the complex central mystery is drooled out episode by episode, but it is drooled out. We find out quite a lot -- although hardly everything. The amount of reveal is very effective in this season, but could be problematic next year as they will not be able to depend on the same  dynamic. The show might not be able to depend on the clones even playing their normal lives (or each others).While Maslany steals the show. Many of the secondary actors are very solid as well. Jordan Gavaris as her (very) gay foster brother is a standout. He about says it all when he sits down at a piano and says, ""let me show you a bit of Queen."" Kevin Hanchard is solid as cop twin Beth's partner.The show feels slightly schizophrenic with regard to its sexuality. At times, in some episodes (like the pilot), it's pleasantly steamy. Maslany does a good bit of walking around in underwear (always a plus). But this remains uneven, unpredictable. When two characters close we never know if the camera will linger or cut to morning. In a way, this keeps the viewer off balance. Deliberate thriller style or mere inconsistency? Who knows.Either way, the show is very much worth watching.Andy Gavin, author of Untimed and The Darkening Dream",5,Phenomenal acting,1377648000,"08 28, 2013",2013,3000,"['Lately', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'shows', 'using', 'device', 'twins', 'borrowing', 'identities', 'Perhaps', 'trend', 'perhaps', 'just', 'fan', 'fave', 'Shakespeare', 'went', 'Comedy', 'Errors', 'Twelfth', 'Night', 'case', 'Orphan', 'Black', 'up', 'ante', 'Not', 'triplets', 'human', 'clones', 'are', 'least', 'seven', 'better', 'last', 'years', 'duplicate', 'thrillers', 'Ringer', 'as', 'much', 'i', ""'m"", 'SMG', 'fan', 'Lying', 'Game', 'pretty', 'good', 'lightweight', 'way', 'crazy', 'impressive', 'Orphan', 'Canadian', 'actress', 'Titiana', 'Maslany', 'Shakespeare', 'reference', 'right', 'there', 'name', 'pull', 'off', 'wildly', 'distinct', 'personalities', 'was', 'incredible', 'aplomb', 'mean', 'seriously', 'can', 'just', 'feel', 'different', 'presence', 'girls', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'quite', 'effectively', 'when', 'one', 'pretending', 'be', 'Watching', 'uptight', 'suburban', 'mom', 'Allison', 'pretending', 'be', 'punk', 'Sarah', 'hilarious', 'effective.This', 'show', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'SF', 'confined', 'clone', 'thing', 'low', 'budget', 'too', 'are', ""n't"", 'ton', 'effects', 'What', 'however', 'very', 'good', 'writing', 'casting', 'acting', 'pacing', 'great', 'show', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'know', 'quality', 'will', 'survive', 'later', 'seasons', 'one', 'break', 'neck', 'characters', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'interesting', 'boy', 'put', 'ringer', 'sorry', 'SMG', 'tone', 'simultaneously', 'dark', 'comic', 'always', 'tense', 'unpredictable', 'one', 'bit', 'pilot', 'where', 'Sarah', 'playing', 'Beth', 'caught', 'impossible', 'situation', 'bathroom', 'buy', 'time', 'then', 'something', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'actually', 'clever', 'solution', 'very', 'effective', 'thriller', 'plotting', ""n't"", 'feel', 'forced', 'overwrought', 'merely', 'tense.Importantly', 'complex', 'central', 'mystery', 'drooled', 'out', 'episode', 'episode', 'drooled', 'out', 'find', 'out', 'quite', 'lot', 'hardly', 'everything', 'amount', 'reveal', 'very', 'effective', 'season', 'could', 'be', 'problematic', 'next', 'year', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'depend', 'same', 'dynamic', 'show', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'depend', 'clones', 'even', 'playing', 'normal', 'lives', 'others', '.While', 'Maslany', 'steals', 'show', 'Many', 'secondary', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'solid', 'well', 'Jordan', 'Gavaris', 'very', 'gay', 'foster', 'brother', 'standout', 'about', 'when', 'down', 'piano', 'let', 'show', 'bit', 'Queen', 'Kevin', 'Hanchard', 'solid', 'cop', 'twin', 'Beth', 'partner.The', 'show', 'slightly', 'schizophrenic', 'regard', 'sexuality', 'times', 'episodes', 'pilot', 'pleasantly', 'steamy', 'Maslany', 'good', 'bit', 'walking', 'around', 'underwear', 'always', 'plus', 'uneven', 'unpredictable', 'When', 'two', 'characters', 'close', 'never', 'know', 'camera', 'will', 'linger', 'cut', 'morning', 'way', 'viewer', 'balance', 'Deliberate', 'thriller', 'style', 'mere', 'inconsistency', 'Who', 'way', 'show', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'watching.Andy', 'Gavin', 'author', 'Untimed', 'Darkening', 'Dream']",Orphan Black: Season 1

1639770,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B00BVMXBDO,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[5, 5]","Sarah Manning, a petty fraudster, has returned to the city she grew up in to put her life back together and reunite with her seven-year-old daughter, in the keeping of Sarah's foster mother. However, Sarah's life is thrown into turmoil when, getting off the train, she immediate comes face-to-face with a woman who is her exact double. The double immediately throws herself in front of a train. Shocked, Sarah steals her belongings and discovers she has a lot of money in savings. Sarah decides to pose her double to take that money and built a new life for her and her daughter...but when she discovers that there are yet other duplicates of her out there, things become a lot more complicated.There are many reasons to watch Orphan Black: its compelling science fiction plot and ramifications (handled with a light touch), the perfectly-timed story development and pacing, the interesting array of three-dimensional supporting characters, its excellent soundtrack and its refusal to conform to any kind of formula are among them. But one stands tall over all others: the absolutely astonishing central performances by Canadian actress Tatiana Maslany. Maslany plays not just the central character of Sarah, but an array of her various doubles and duplicates. In one episode she plays no less than five characters, many of them interacting with each other. The interactions themselves are convincing (with judicious use of CGI and overlaying of images, but mostly clever double work and positioning) but it's Maslany's ability to fully inhabit and develop each character as a completely separate individual that is jaw-dropping. Even when they are posing as one another, it's possible to tell which is which through subtle nuances of expression. Before the season is half over, it's easy to join in the chorus of voices expressing disapproval that Maslany was robbed of an Emmy nomination this year. The only flaw in her performance is her 'street' English accent she uses as Sarah, which is mostly acceptable but occasionally dips towards Dick van Dyke territory. But it's easy to forgive given how good she is on every other level.The supporting cast is a mixture of other young talent and established names. Providing experience and presence are Matt 'Max Headroom' Frewer and Maria Doyle Kennedy (probably best known internationally as Queen Catherine of Aragon on The Tudors, also known as 'the best thing in it') as the morally ambiguous Dr. Leekie and as Sarah's foster-mother Siobhan respectively. Amongst the other younger castmembers are Jordan Gavaris as Sarah's foster-brother and partner-in-crime Felix (whose English accent is better, though still a bit affected) and Michael Mando (who played the psychotic Vaas in the recent computer game Far Cry 3) as Vic, Sarah's highly unreliable ex-boyfriend who plays both an antagonistic and comic role as the series progresses. The cast is, as a whole, fairly likable and play their parts well, though the otherwise-solid Kevin Hanchard could do with bringing a bit more subtlety to his role as Detective Art Bell.The series has a relentless pace to it which makes a nice change from other shows that seem to delight in rationing out their secrets to the audience over many years. Instead, Orphan Black covers more ground in its first episode than most shows manage in two seasons. By the end of these opening ten episodes alliances have been forged and shattered, major characters have arrived and been killed off and the secrets behind the duplicates have been exposed, explored, developed and complicated several times over. Yet the show never feels rushed, with a good blend of drama, psychological horror and occasionally hilarious comedy (particularly driven by Sarah's 'soccer mom' double, Alison) making each episode immensely watchable and indeed re-watchable in the light of information unveiled in later episodes. The show is also sensible in dropping even major characters for several episodes in a row when they have nothing to do rather than giving them pointless filler storylines. Not only is the cast good, but their interactions are highly engaging: Felix and Alison's initially prickly relationship develops into a more amusing friendship as the season continues, whilst Sarah finds it tricky to deceive Art, a good man who may end up on the opposing side to her.Picking out flaws is almost impossible, and the most noticeable (such as Sarah's accent) are pretty trivial. One of the revelations in the season finale is a bit puzzling, since it is completely illegal and would never stand up in a court of law yet the characters react like it's a life-changing moment. There's also an argument that the actual cliffhanger is leaning towards the predictable cop-out side of things and, on occasion (most notably in the final two episodes, which barely pause for breath), the show's pace runs away with it a little and allows it to get away with a few minor lapses in plot logic.But it's hard to criticise the show too much. Orphan Black's first season (****) is relentlessly entertaining, supremely-acted by its star and its science fiction plot is surprisingly well-developed (the science itself is a bit simplified for casual viewers, but the social ramifications are addressed nicely). It is available now on DVD and Blu-Ray in the USA, but, somewhat perplexingly, not until August 2014 in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray).",5,An intelligent show with an astonishing central

And probably the least watched, since it isn't on a main network or on a well-known cable channel.Canadian actress Tatian Maslany plays Sarah Manning, a street-smart young woman who has had to hustle just to stay alive and ahead of the bill collectors. Her life is turned upside down when she witnesses a suicide -- a woman jumping in front of a train -- especially since the woman looked like her long-lost twin.  She decides to take her place for a while, in order to take advantage of her money and her lifestyle (nice apartment, etc.).  Big mistake: apparently Sarah's doppelganger was a police detective -- one who seems to have been involved in shady dealings.  Just when it seems Sarah has gotten herself out of one fix -- because of the dealings of her dead doppelganger -- she lands in another pot of hot water.  Worse, Sarah stumbles across evidence of a larger, possibly government-connected conspiracy.  And stumbles across a few more ""doppelgangers"".Tatiana Maslany is an _amazing_ young actress: not only does she manage to play different versions of ""herself"" (replete with accents that range from cockney to midwestern American to German), but she does it such an expert way that one actually feels as if they are watching completely _different_ actresses playing the parts.  Amazing.And Jordan Gavaris -- as her gay best friend -- is equally impressive.

This show is a collaboration between Canadian and American productions and the majority of the show takes place in Ontario, which I only figured out by paying attention to the license plates of vehicles. To really pull off a show like this you need two things, a very good lead actress and very good writing. Season one delivers both.Tatiana Maslany is previously unheard of by me but she has done an impressive job in this first season and it made me wonder where this lady has been hiding. Her ability to switch between different clone personalities is amazing. Never once did I feel that one clone felt like another with her remarkable performance. Her body language, demeanor and manner of speech change with each clone she has to pretend to be. Which, to me, seems quite a challenge for just one production but one she handles quite capably. I think what struck me the best is how she handles pretending to be one person while pretending to be another. I speak about her the most because she carries the show, but luckily the supporting acting is also equally wonderful. Except for her, suddenly new, boyfriend, Paul. His is the only performance where I kind of found it to be wooden. He seems more male model than actor but time can prove that differently (I guess you ladies might like him).The writing in this show is really quite good. It&#8217;s also very clever, with the way it is written as Sarah finds out things so does the audience. It feels natural in its progression and doesn&#8217;t feel like any of the plot points are too forced. There are definitely twists and turns in the show and each character feels like a real person with baggage. Even though this is on the fringe side of science, the writing brings it to plausible territory very well and you find yourself accepting the premise of the show quite easily. Or at least, I did.This is one show I feel you should take time from your day to give it a watch.

First episodes-- even for good ones-- can be awkward, with the cast and writers not yet finding the chemistry.This one hit managed to hit maximum speed seconds after it began, and then spent the rest of the show proving there was more to spare. Somehow, it did this without sacrificing character development. Thanks to co-creator John Fawcett's taut direction, and remarkable performances by Tatiana Maslani as three physically identical women with distinct personalities, accents and mannerisms. She even plays one mimicking another, with her cockney accent wavering.The story is about Sarah, a young woman surviving on the margins as a hustler and a drug dealer, who's just walked out on her boyfriend. She witnesses a stranger identical to herself, Beth, commit suicide. Sarah steals and assumes her identity. Despite the fact that Sarah had little to lose, it turns out this was not the best move. The mysterious pink cellphone and a recently loaded savings account hint at the weird secrets that drove Elizabeth to suicide.The show has one gamble in its structure, that is, Sarah is not a likeable character. Even if you can't warm up to her anti-heroism, you might still enjoy the trouble she brings on herself and still admire the cleverness she shows. Maslani's remarkable performance generates fascination. I expect that as the plot continues to unfold, we'll see Sarah's other better qualities.Maslani seems like a chameleon, and co-Creator, Fawcett, is the best filmmaker out of Canada, having made the timeless horror movie &#34;Ginger Snaps.&#34;  I'm hooked.

She's in shock when she witnesses the suicide of her look-alike Detective Elizabeth ""Beth"" Childs, whom just happens to leave her purse containing her identification. Being a con artist, Sarah takes over Beth's identity, mostly to clear out Beth's bank accounts before the authorities learn of her death; plus, Sarah is trying to runaway from ex-boyfriend. She hopes the money is enough for her to start a new life with her seven-year-old daughter, Kira.The longer Sarah stays as Beth, the more dangerous her life becomes as she learns there are more look-alikes, a housewife, a science nerd, and a crazy assassin. Allied with her foster brother, Felix, and two of her chameleons, Sarah is determined to figure out what is going on and who she really is.Episodes on the 3-disc DVD are:Disc 1:Natural SelectionInstinctVariation Under NatureEffects of External ConditionsDisc 2:Conditions of ExistenceVariations Under DomesticationParts Developed in an Unusual ManneEntangled BankDisc 3:Unconscious SelectionEndless Forms Most BeautifulSpecial Features:Interview with Tatiana and Set Tour from ""The Nerdist""Send in the ClonesInsider VignettesI don't get BBC America in my area, but I saw the series advertise on a recent Doctor Who DVD release and it looked intriguing.

Despite having a science fiction plot, the series is more of a thriller, similar in style to the X-Files or even Torchwood. The supporting cast is great, especially Matt Fewer as the so-called villain. For me, the episodes were more likes chapters in a good book as it kept getting better and better. The bad news is it ended in a cliffhanger, but the second season will air in the spring of 2014!

Well, I'll try.1. Don't see this if you need glossy, upbeat Hollywoody science fiction. There isn't a single Dudly Do-Right in the entire cast of characters. Everyone has issues. Everyone has baggage. Problems can't always be solved by sweet reason, Star Trek style. And who's a Good Guy or a Bad Guy isn't always clear, even when you learn just who and what they are. And with some of the more damaged characters, they can't necessarily be fixed--ever. Some things you can't come back from. And problems don't have quick fixes. That is, there's no pandering to your inner 12 year old. This is a show for grown-ups.There is hope, and character growth, and goodness--but not unmixed, and not come by easily. Think about Egon Schindler of Schindler's List--a womanizer, war profiteer, Nazi collaborator--who also saved over 900 Jews. He'd fit right in here.2. Don't see this if you have to have a saintly, lovable central character who always does the right thing without hesitation. If you're the kind of person who likes to sit in judgement of others, and who thinks nothing in a person's upbringing/environment can excuse anything wrong they do, skip Orphan Black. There's no black and white morality to be had here.3. Skip this if you need your science fiction to be 100% scientifically plausible. The basic premise for the show isn't possible in the timeframe of the show (it's set in present-day Toronto). I forgive the show for this--it would have made the show too expensive to produce if it had been set 40 years in the future. And the show is so character-driven that that this flaw is overshadowed by the rest of it anyway.4. This has moments of sex, violence and bad language that aren't outside the envelope of today's television, but it sure ain't ""Little House on the Prairie"" or a Hallmark Special either. And the general intensity level is HIGH. A Russian friend of mine thought it was overacted, but she's the kind of person who expects characters to always respond to events optimally--which I see as a holdover of the ""Soviet Realism"" she was raised on--where every show is expected to function as straightforward moral instruction. This show has a moral center, but it doesn't wear it on its sleeve.5. See this if you loved the best of Hitchcock's movies--scary, intelligent, suspenseful, sometimes white-knuckly, more fear, less gore. Don't see this if a little gore is too much for you, though. There's a scene of self-surgery that's rather stomach-churning, though it isn't gratuitous. And it's not the only Ewwww! moment in the show. Forewarned is forearmed.6. See this if you admire great--not good, great--acting. The show's star, 28 year old Canadian actress Tatiana Maslany, from Regina, Saskatchewan, won the Critics' Choice award for Best Actress in a TV Drama (the drama being Orphan Black), dumbfounding all the Hollywood Establishment types who perhaps hadn't even heard of this show.I love great stars like Audrey Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart, who cultivate an onscreen persona and mostly play that throughout their careers. Maslany is a different kind of actor--the kind who can play ANYONE. The kind who can disappear into a role so deeply you forget the actor and only see the character they're playing. She's an actor's actor, like Alec Guinness was. Maslany plays multiple roles in Orphan Black, and in each role she's that person--character, mannerisms, dialect, everything. You're never unclear as to which character you're looking at--including when she's playing one of her characters pretending to be another of her characters.Acting schools will have their students watch Orphan Black to see how it should be done. James Lipton will be camping on Maslany's doorstep to get her on his Actor's Studio interview show.The other characters are well-acted too--particularly the young man who plays the central character's brother. I've seen him in interviews and he's nothing like his character. And it's a role that could have been overplayed; instead it's given a nuanced performance by this actor.7. See it if you like mysteries that gradually answer your questions, without copouts. This isn't like ""Lost,"" where the final resolution of the plot left most viewers going ""Seriously?"" Not here. You'll have a lot of questions, and you'll get a gradual stream of answers--though many lead to more questions, but those get answered too, and so forth.8. See this if you prefer serialized shows; don't see this if you insist on episodic shows. That is, the first season of Orphan Black is a 430 minute movie. Don't even think of seeing it any other way. You'll be lost, and not in a good way.9. See this if you like to pay attention. Don't try to play this while you're doing a crossword puzzle. You'll miss something important.10. Humor: not much. There are frequent light touches, but mostly it's a drama, and a drama on the white-knuckle side of things. Called it fast-paced is an understatement. My spouse and I returned from our honeymoon in Japan on the last airliner out of Tokyo before they closed the airport due to an incoming typhoon. On our takeoff roll the rain was blowing horizontally. One we were airborne that fully-loaded 747 bounced around as if it was a little Cesna 152. The passengers were audibly gasping in unison every time that huge airplane abruptly dropped a few dozen feet.Orphan Black moves like that.As I said, the show is set in the present day. The science fiction aspects are real but don't involve the visual props of most sci-fi--no space ships, no aliens, no time travel, no teleporting, really very little requiring CGI other than what's needed to put Maslany on the screen in several places at one time. I can think of one little thing, but you only see it briefly and I'd have to give you a spoiler to tell you more.This means that people who don't go for the really futuristic stuff might like this one. On the other hand, those who love the futuristic stuff might question whether this is really sci-fi (it is, though).I hope I've told you enough to get you to see the pilot--provided none of my cautions are a problem for you. I watch way too much TV for my own good, and I've found myself looking forward to the next episode--and season--more than almost any other show I've seen. Right up there with Game of Thrones, only on a miniscule fraction of the budget. And the fact that it delivers so much bang for the budget impresses me, though strictly speaking I suppose I shouldn't give it credit for that.If you need to find out what the plot is, read any of the other reviews here. But I urge you not to. See the pilot. Then come back here and read them.If you want to calibrate your tastes against mine, here are some sci-fi shows I've liked:Babylon 5DefianceDoctor Who (the reboot, not the old series)FarscapeLexxRed DwarfStar Trek (and Next Gen but not so much Voyager or Deep Space Nine)Moviewise I'm reminded a bit of Let Me In/Let the Right One In, even though they aren't science fiction but rather fantasy. But they also have that gritty, realistic quality that's so missing from so much sci-fi/fantasy.",5,No-spoilers review--and you really need that for Orphan Black,1372377600,"06 28,

Sarah Manning (Tatiana Maslany) sees a woman throw herself in front of train.

I do have some reservations in regard to the execution. Mazlany has a tough task in trying to hold down all the roles and it's a bit uneven. To her credit she gets better as the series progresses and her handling of the Ukrainian character is a true highlight. I also could have used better lensing. BBC has a lot of series with the look of, say &#34;Downton Abbey.&#34; This is better than that but not quite up to the standards of the current &#34;Sherlock Holmes&#34; series. If one looks at &#34;The Killing&#34; or &#34;The Bridge&#34; they can see, right off the bat, that those just look better.That being said, this is great effort.

Orphan Black takes the dual role challenge way farther, into the outer reaches of what one actress can be asked to do - and does it really well. The season ended with more questions than answers and I can't wait to see how it will go forward! One woman, ordinary sort who is clearly in dire straits, gets a chance to start fresh. She's a gambler and she takes the bet, pretending to be another person only to find out that she has stepped into something a lot more complicated than what she was trying to escape. And her old troubles just follow her. Tons of surprising characters, a London landscape that mixes grit and shine with supporting characters that kept me guessing.

I would like to have continued watching but when I start rooting for the star character to be killed, it is time for me to stop.  First the story, I won't go into details as not to spoil the show for those that want to watch.  It basically follows a woman who steals someone else's identity that looks just like her.  There are some very interesting plot developments and twists which keeps up your interest level.  The relationships between characters are also very intriguing.So why did I stop watching?  Partly because the acting and dialogue were mediocre at best.  The main actress is horrible.  She absolutely has no talent.  No matter whether she is scared, angry, sad, happy, constipated or whatever, she has the same dead pan expression on her face.  It never changes.  It wouldn't surprise me if she gets a Botox injection right before filming.The primary reason I hate this show is because of the main character, Sarah Manning.  Not only does the actress do a poor acting job but the character is probably the most narcissistic, self absorbed character I have ever seen on television.  She disappears from her family for months, comes back and starts demanding her only friend/family to help her.  When her ""brother"" asks why, she blows him off.  Case in point in one scene, she walks in unannounced into her ""brother's"" apartment with blood on her face, gives him a hard time for helping her out, won't answer any of his worried questions, then demands he do more favors for her.  I won't go into anymore detail but I can't continue watching the show when I actually passionately hate the main character and wish bodily harm befalls her.  For most it seems that this is not an issue.  So if you are one of those people, hope you enjoy the series.

Art Bell, Beth's partner), Michael Mando (Vic - Sarah's boyfriend she abandoned), Maria Doyle Kennedy (Mrs. S the foster mother) and Skyler Wexler (Sarah's daughter) -- The other 5 roles (3 additional others that disappeared/died) are played by Tatiana superbly -- each having a different stance, walk, posture, mannerisms and speech.Orphan Black is about a Sarah Manning, a street smart young woman that walked out on her child 10 months prior that returns home and learns by accident while stealing Beth's identity, there are a group of women that all look exactly like her.  Turns out these women are clones, who have been monitored.  Although these women are all identical, DNA-wise, that is the only thing identical about them.Sarah is a street smart hustler.Allison is a prim and proper, gun toting soccer mom.Cosima is a gay naive science geek.Helena is an psychopath that is killing the clones.Elizabeth (Beth) is a police officer.There is also a professional clone -- or pro-clone as Felix calls her.This first season is about Sarah taking responsibility as well as the group of women learning not only to trust one another but who not to trust.  Don't be fooled into thinking this is a &#34;girly&#34; show, it isn't.  This show will force you to think and it is far from predictable.  The actions of some of the women will be surprising and unexpected as you take this journey with them to learn more about who cloned them and why.Helena's insane behavior reveals some logic to her behavior.  Allison begins to spin out of control as she suspects everyone of being her clone spy.  Cosima makes mistakes because she doesn't understand exactly how naive she is.  Sarah is under pressure from Paul, Vic, Mrs. S., the clones and especially Helena (who has decided not to kill Sarah because she feels a connection to her and when you find out what it is you will say @amn).There is some violence but this season is about putting the puzzle together, learning who is who, hoping someone you've grown attached to doesn't die and understanding the big picture.  Is there some heart-ache?  Yep.  Are there some moments to cheer?  Yep.  Will this show make you say &#34;what the Puck?&#34;  Absolutely -- several times.

Her range in acting is evident immediately, her eyes smolder with intensity and with fear and anger and sadness, and whatever else the scene may require. Almost immediately we are thrown in to Sarah's plight and just as confused as she is. A strong series opening episode, albeit confusing, I think that is the point. This show is told from Sarah's view point and the idea is to figure out the plot of the show with Sarah as she figures it out for herself.*Episode Review*""Natural Selection"" written by John Fawcett and Graeme Manson and directed by John Fawcett starts out with Sarah, a street smart estranged single mother witnessing the suicide of a woman on a train platform in Canada who happens to look exactly like her. Felix played by Jordan Gavaris (Degrassi: The Next Generation) plays Sarah's foster brother who helps her escape her life by assuming the newly dead doppelgangers identity. In an attempt to take over this persons life and emptying her bank account, Sarah inadvertently inherits all the problems that come along with taking over someone elses identity. The denouement of the episode answers some lingering questions and also flips everything on it head and poses even more questions with a very intense awesome action scene that comes way out of left field from an otherwise very methodically paced episode. For a first episode, I was immediately drawn in and intrigued, this show is a great pairing with Doctor Who on the Supernatural Saturday's on BBC America. Side note, there was a decent amount of nudity in this episode which I thought was great because I think Tatiana Maslany is sexy. Some may think this was unnecessary but I think it was meant to show how Sarah uses her sexuality to her advantage, and how quick she can think on her toes. So this show is not super kid friendly, but I think adults will enjoy this sexy, smart thriller. Can't wait to see where the next 9 episodes take this show.""Instinct"" written by Graeme Manson and directed by John Fawcett has our main character Sarah on the run from an assassin who killed the German at the end of last weeks episode ""Natural Selection"". Sarah buries the body, gets a call from another identical who tells her to go to the Germans hotel room and retrieve her briefcase. Meanwhile Sarah continues her con as Beth, (the dead identical who's identity Sarah has taken over) and has realized that Beth's police partner Art, has taken the $75,000 that Sarah emptied from Beth's bank account (kind of confusing I know). After using info taken from the German's briefcase, Sarah tracks down another identical, Alison, who happens to be a soccer mom. They set up a rendezvous for a later time, Sarah brings Felix as her back up and more secrets and questions are answered and at the same time more questions are posed. This show is still very intriguing and I am very curious what direction this show is going to go, because at this point it could go in a lot of different directions.""Variation Under Nature"" written by Graeme Manson and directed by David Frazee (Continuum, Flashpoint) starts with Sarah face to face with Alison and Cosima, who waste no time breaking the news that they are all clones and being killed off. Cosima will give Sarah more details when Sarah gives her the Germans brief case. Meanwhile Sarah still has to play at being Beth so Art will give her the money he took from her that she emptied from Beth's account. Sarah finds herself reinstated as an on duty officer after passing the hearing from an accidental shooting. Soon Sarah is answering a call with Art and finds herself at the exact site she buried the assassinated German, not realizing it was an active quarry site. The body is chewed up but prints have been found, and Cosima maybe her only help to get her out of this tight spot. Sarah gives Cosima the case and Cosima tells Sarah she has to keep pretending to be Beth so that they can use police intel to stay safe and dig for clues. While at the police station, a mysterious caller (the killer targeting the clones) gives Art some vague info about his activities. Sarah deletes some incriminating pictures off of the Evidence Tech's computer. Afterward she meets with Mrs. S. to set up a visit with her daughter Kira. Meanwhile Art pieces together more of the Germans murder while at the murder scene. Felix gets some great and comedic screen time in this episode. We find out that the $75,000 that Sarah took from Beth's bank account didn't exactly belong to her, which makes it even more imperative that Sarah gets it back from Art. Sarah and Art get a lead on a stolen motorcycle that may be a match to tire tracks at the scene of the Germans murder, this lands Sarah and Art in the line of fire. Like the first episode, this episode ends with some intense action. This show is shaping up nicely and answering enough questions to keep it interesting and leaving enough unanswered to keep it intriguing. We find out who the killer is in this episode, and it's heavy man. Can't wait to see what happens in next weeks episode ""Effects of External Conditions"".""Effects of External Conditions"" written by Karen Walton (Ginger Snaps, Flashpoint) and directed by Grant Harvey (Gone, Heartland) starts with the killer cleaning the wound Sarah inflicted on her. A young boy walks in on her and she grabs his hand and walks him into the bathroom where she is cleaning up and closes the door behind them, presumably to kill him. Meanwhile Sarah and Alison talk about the events that just happened. Sarah gives Alison her $75,000 back and tells her about her plan to run off with it but gives it back because she too has a family. After a text from Art, Sarah meets him at a crime scene where the Killer ditched her bike. Luckily the little boy was not murdered. When they ask the boy what the Killer looked like, he points to Sarah/Beth. The Killer left a clue in the form of a cootie catcher. Sarah struggles again to get along with Mrs. S. who threatens to not let Sarah see her daughter Kira if she misses their meeting. Back at the police station they reveal that the body found at the quarry was killed by gunshot. Sarah/Beth gets a phone call from the Killer who wants to meet. The Killer knows she is not Beth and threatens to expose Sarah's lie if she doesn't meet with her. The Killer infiltrates the police station and learns how close they are to catching her. Sarah, Art and other officers search a place they believe the Killer maybe. Sarah realizes she won't be able to make the meeting with Mrs. S so she asks Felix to get Alison to pretend to be her and meet with Mrs. S. and Kira. When Sarah and Art get back to the station, they realize the Killer has been there. The scenes between Felix and Alison are great, extremely funny. Tatiana Maslany's ability to play multiple characters gets better and better each episode. Paul shows up after the Killer called him and pretended to be Sarah. The killer calls Sarah again at the station, who still wants to meet. Sarah finds a video on her computer that the Killer made, confessing to the murder of Maggie Chen that Beth ""accidentally"" killed. Alison and Felix arrive at Mrs. S.'s, meanwhile Art and Angela seem to question Sarah's story about the Killer. Kira knows that Alison is not he mother Sarah, while Sarah follows the trail to meet with the Killer. Unlike my review which seems to be all over the place, the show isn't. The first episode was a bit confusing but as the show progresses and questions are answered, this show has great pacing. It's tense and intriguing. I cannot wait for next weeks episode ""Conditions of Existence"".""Conditions Of Existence"" written by Alex Levine (Flashpoint, Stargate SG-1) and directed by T.J. Scott (Spartacus: War of The Damned, and the forthcoming Black Sails on STARZ which looks awesome) focuses on Sarah, Alison and Cosima realizing that they are being watched as some part of ongoing experiment. Sarah suspects Paul is watching her, Alison suspects her husband has been assigned to watch her, and Cosima is unsure of who is looking after her. Sarah thanks Alison for filling in as her so she can now pick her daughter Kira up from school and take her home to Mrs. S's. As Sarah probes further into what Paul does for a living, she triggers him to start putting together the pieces of his own puzzle because of her strange behavior. Alison finds a case in the garage that her husband rips from her hands to keep her from opening. Things are getting tense for these two couples as secrets are starting to bubble to the service. Cosima seems to have met a new friend in the lab, or has she? After Sarah visits Paul's work to bug it, her and Felix listen in on what is being said, here some big news is revealed. This leads to a phone call to Sarah where Paul plays a move to convince her to meet him, this is where things get really tense. Meanwhile Vic spots Alison at a shopping center after getting the hurt put on him by some local drug thugs. Thinking Alison is Sarah, he confronts her and demands to know what she did with the cocaine she stole from him and tells her the thugs will kill him if he cannot furnish the $15,000 he now owes them.  He is promptly pepper sprayed and tased which is hilarious. A lot of big stuff happens this episode, some major plot points are revealed, there are some good laughs and sentimental moments as well. And excellently balanced episode and well-crafted all around. Next week's episode ""Variations Under Domestication"" looks insane, and looks as if a lot of big stuff is going to go down.",5,Orphan Black,1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,9813,"['Orphan', 'Black',

The story  begins immediately and keeps getting better. The characters are extremely engaging and the mystery compelling. I watched three episodes the first night.  Tatiana Maslany is simply amazing. When my husband started watching, he had no idea she was playing the part of all the main characters because her performances of each of them is so unique. Each woman has her own look, body motions, facial expressions and personality. Her Helena is creepy and takes quirky mannerisms to a whole new level. Jordan Gavaris lends comic relief, kindness, friendship, the voice of reason and free spirit to the show. I can't imagine the show without his frank assessments of each situation and character.

A 43-minute Orphan Black episode seemed just the thing.  I mean, how deep can a show about clones be?  Whatever it is, it has surely been done to death already.Boy were we ever wrong.  Because this is a show that really does make you think.  Don't get me wrong--the stereotypes are all there: the soccer mom is totally uptight, the Eastern European has never heard of clothes that actually fit, the kid from UC Berkeley would put the biggest hippie on Telegraph to shame, the drifter (who's poor btw) never takes off the leather jacket I can't afford, the Irish woman has the famous temper, the Black Ops guy is impossibly gorgeous (with never a scratch on him), and so on and so forth.  But underneath all of that, there is a serious message.  A lot of them.Today, genetics companies own diseases.  Especially the common ones that really scare us.  (Ever wonder why the only available--i.e., affordable-- cure for breast cancer dates back from the 1800s?  That's why.)  How do they own diseases?  They patent them.  Remember the SARS virus and how hard it was to get the drugs out there?  That was because different strains of the disease were owned by different genetics companies and until those companies could sort out whose patent governed what (and hence who was going to get paid for what) people had to just keep on dying.  Before he died, Michael Crichton estimated that about 20% of our bodies are already patented by the genetics companies. That's not in the movie. That happened in real life.The series just takes it a step further.  So what if these people--these eminently recognizable because they are after all stereotype characters--were wholly owned by a genetics company?  Not 20% of them; not their disease--all of them and everything they could biologically do and/or produce.  What then?  What does it mean to be human then?That, IMO, ultimately is what this series is about.

ORPHAN BLACK would be any actor's dream as lovely Tatiana Maslany stars as several characters. Often she is on screen with one or more versions of &#34;herself.&#34; Maslany's main character is Sarah Manning, a seriously troubled single mother with a sordid history. The action begins immediately as Sarah accidentally stumbles upon her apparent identical twin, Beth,  in the midst of committing suicide. Sarah has few morals so why not assume her &#34;twin's&#34; identity to clean out a bank account or two.Sarah is out for the money and to get her young daughter back from her foster mother. Soon we learn that Sarah is not as heartless and she seems and her need to uncover the mystery of her origin becomes stronger. There are several versions of &#34;Sarah&#34; and is fun to see them interact together. We quickly learn why Sarah has so many identical versions of herself.ORPHAN BLACK is a fresh take on a few film genres. It's Sci-Fi, and a crime/detective drama with an occasional film noir feel.We quickly learn Sarah's secret as does her new boyfriend, her handlers and all of her doubles. The writers must enjoy the twists of this show. Occasionally, an element of the story drags on but for the most part, it's fast paced and addictive.The cast is phenomenal. They may not be household names but there is an array of talent here.Sarah has a gay foster brother Felix (Jordan Gavaris), He is apparently as unsavory as she is but soon we seen he also has a heart and would do anything for Sarah. Dylan Bruce as Paul Dierden seems a little stiff at first and his connection to his girlfriend Beth seems tenuous until he realizes Beth is actually Sarah. Add in all the characters played by Maslany and the character's significant others, friends and family and there is quite the cats. One person of note is Maria Doyle Kennedy playing  the mysterious Mrs. S - the foster mother who raised Sarah and Felix and is now raising Sarah's daughter Kiera. It is always a joy to see this lovely and talented actress.ORPHAN BLACK grabs your attention in the first scene and does not let go. The finale leaves you only wanting more.

When this Canadian series appeared on BBCAmerica (yeah, I don't get it either), I didn't get around to watching it even though the professional reviews were certainly impressive.  However, when the EMMY nominations approached, all anyone could talk about was the blistering work of rising star Tatiana Maslany.  Maslany plays multiple roles concurrently throughout the ten episode run of Season One.  I hesitate to reveal any spoilers, but you can't really approach the DVD without already knowing it is about clones due to the description and advertising materials.  I'll still be vague, however, in any discussion of the show as it is best left to unravel with all surprises intact.  But Maslany does play many versions of the same character, each with a distinct temperament and back story and even nationality.  To paraphrase one of my favorite blurbs about Maslany: ""if it wasn't the best acting of the season, it was easily the most acting of the season.""  Sadly, Maslany did not get that deserved EMMY nod, but she did become one of the biggest breakout stars of the 2013.We see much of ""Orphan Black"" through the eyes of Sarah Manning.  A street tough with a troubled past. a drug dealing boyfriend, and an estranged daughter she hasn't seen in a year, Sarah just hopes to get her life back together.  As she contemplates the choices ahead, she witnesses something absolutely mind boggling.  A woman who looks just like her commits suicide right before her eyes.  Never one to pass on an opportunity, Sarah swipes the lady's bag, heads off to her posh apartment, and begins a plot to extract any available finances from the dead woman's estate.  Before she can make a clean getaway, however, she starts to get embroiled in something she doesn't understand.  Another version of herself appears and is promptly murdered.  Sarah, now acting as Beth, suddenly finds herself as a suspended cop with a boyfriend and a ton of questions.  Things get even murkier as other replicas start appearing including a suburban housewife, an American academician, and a ruthless assassin.  What's a girl to do?  Someone has to get to the bottom of this mystery and Sarah takes on the task with the help of her other selves.  As the series progresses, the conspiracy becomes more labyrinthine and more compelling.With all the surrounding hype, I was afraid that ""Orphan Black"" would fall short in my estimation.  And truthfully, I thought the beginning episodes were only good but not great.  But the deeper you go, the richer it gets.  By the sixth episode where a wacky neighborhood potluck party brings together major players from different factions, I was having an incredible amount of fun with the clever overlaps.  This is a rare show that has both geek chic AND cool kid cred.  Yes, it may be outlandish at times but it is never dumb.  The various characters that Maslany plays are interwoven with perfection.  Already approved for a Second Season, I can't wait to get back to the adventure and the mystery.  At ten episodes, Season One is the perfect binge watch show.  With cliffhangers wrapping up almost every hour, it is extremely difficult to stop after just one!  Maslany is worth the price of admission, but the show deserves props for being surprisingly smart, sophisticated, hysterical, thrilling, and wildly entertaining.  I'm officially drinking the Kool-aid.  Watch ""Orphan Black!""

For 2013, it's a smart and sexy sci-fi suspense thriller starring Canadian actress Tatiana Maslany, who recently won the Critics' Choice Award for Best Actress in a Drama for her multi-role part in BBC Americas' ""Orphan Black."" Contenders included Claire Danes for ""Homeland,"" Julianna Marguiles for ""The Good Wife,"" and Elizabeth Moss for ""Mad Men.""It's unbelievable Maslany was snubbed by the Emmy Awards. What were they thinking? Still, we get these surprises - or shocks - every year, too. (""The Walking Dead"" got nothing again, even after a dynamite 3rd season.)""The initial inspiration for `Orphan Black' was John saying `Wouldn't it be cool if you saw yourself on a train platform and then killed yourself?'"" co-creator/writer Graeme Manson says at the start of making-of feature, ""Send in the Clones.""""I think that Graeme and I got very excited about this because we loved the idea of seeing yourself in multiplicity,"" co-creator/director John Fawcett continues.The main character, Sarah Manning, is a product of the foster care system; she's street smart, living on the edge of chaos. Having just run away from her abusive, drug dealing boyfriend, Sarah encounters the suicide who looks just like her. Despite the shock, Sarah picks up the woman's purse and takes off. She meets up with her gay foster brother Felix, played by Jordan Gavaris in another tour de force performance, where we learn Sarah hopes to change her life enough to care for her 7-year-old daughter, Kira.But Sarah keeps running into women who look exactly like her: Cosima, the genius science geek from San Francisco; Alison, the straight laced suburbanite; Katja, the German punk rocker, and Helena, the killer psycho, a cutter with angel wings carved into her back. Obviously, this isn't just a lost twin or triplet. What's more, someone is trying to kill these look-alikes.Maslany breathes so much life and personality into each character that they all matter. I cared about what happened, what was going on, and speculated on the Big Plot in each of the 10 episodes. So will you. An intense season finale leaves us with a promise of more thrills to come in Season 2, airing Spring 2014.An extra, ""Send in the Clones"" is a good breakdown of the series' inspiration with reactions from Maslany, but it's full of spoilers. Don't watch any of the extras - including ""Interviewing Tatiana, a set tour and interview from ""The Nerdist,"" or the ""Insider Vignettes"" featuring short takes on the major characters - until after viewing the series.Then you'll want to find out as much as you can about ""Orphan Black.""-- Kay Reynolds",5,Amazing acting and a smart story make a great debut season,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,2645,"['TV', 'SEASON', 'new', 'sleeper', 'hit', '2013', 'smart', 'sexy', 'sci-fi', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'starring', 'Canadian', 'actress', 'Tatiana', 'Maslany', 'who', 'recently', 'won', 'Critics', 'Choice', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Drama', 'multi-role', 'part', 'BBC', 'Americas', 'Orphan', 'Black', 'Contenders', 'included', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Homeland', 'Julianna', 'Marguiles', 'Good', 'Wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Moss', 'Mad', 'Men', 'unbelievable', 'Maslany', 'was', 'snubbed', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'What', 'were', 'thinking', 'Still', 'get', 'surprises', 'shocks', 'year', 'too', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'got', 'nothing', 'again', 'even', 'dynamite', '3rd', 'season', 'initial', 'inspiration', 'Orphan', 'Black', 'was', 'John', 'saying', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'cool', 'saw', 'train', 'platform', 'then', 'killed', 'co-creator/writer', 'Graeme', 'Manson', 'start', 'making-of', 'feature', 'Send', 'Clones', 'think', 'Graeme', 'got', 'very', 'excited', 'loved', 'idea', 'seeing', 'multiplicity', 'co-creator/director', 'John', 'Fawcett', 'continues.The', 'main', 'character', 'Sarah', 'Manning', 'product', 'foster', 'care', 'system', 'street', 'smart', 'living', 'edge', 'chaos', 'Having', 'just', 'run', 'away', 'abusive', 'drug', 'dealing', 'boyfriend', 'Sarah', 'suicide', 'who', 'just', 'shock', 'Sarah', 'up', 'woman', 'purse', 'off', 'up', 'gay', 'foster', 'brother', 'Felix', 'played', 'Jordan', 'Gavaris', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'where', 'learn', 'Sarah', 'hopes', 'change', 'life', 'enough', 'care', '7-year-old', 'daughter', 'Kira.But', 'Sarah', 'running', 'women', 'who', 'look', 'exactly', 'Cosima', 'genius', 'science', 'geek', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Alison', 'straight', 'laced', 'suburbanite', 'Katja', 'German', 'punk', 'rocker', 'Helena', 'killer', 'psycho', 'cutter', 'angel', 'wings', 'carved', 'back', 'Obviously', ""n't"", 'just', 'lost', 'twin', 'triplet', 'What', 'more', 'someone', 'trying', 'kill', 'look-alikes.Maslany', 'breathes', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'personality', 'character', 'matter', 'cared', 'what', 'happened', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'speculated', 'Big', 'Plot', '10', 'episodes', 'So', 'will', 'intense', 'season', 'finale', 'promise', 'more', 'thrills', 'come', 'Season', '2', 'airing', 'Spring', '2014.An', 'extra', 'Send', 'Clones', 'good', 'breakdown', 'series', 'inspiration', 'reactions', 'Maslany', 'full', 'spoilers', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'extras', 'including', 'Interviewing', 'Tatiana', 'set', 'tour', 'interview', 'Nerdist', 'Insider', 'Vignettes', 'featuring', 'short', 'major', 'characters', 'viewing', 'series.Then', ""'ll"", 'want', 'find', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'Orphan', 'Black', 'Kay', 'Reynolds']",Orphan Black: Season 1

I thought it would be a gimmick and silly. How wrong I was. Tatiana Maslany's performance in this show is mind blowing. Each of her characters doesn't just have say a different hair color--they have wholly separate personalities and ways of simply moving. They walk and sit differently. Not once when watching was I pulled out of the story and think that it was ridiculous. Tatiana's acting is simply superb.I thought about several mainstream Hollywood actresses, and wondered if they could even possibly begin to pull Tatiana's characters off--and got nothing. Tatiana isn't just an incredible actress but she has a remarkably physical androgyny that is crucial to her being believable as different people. Not that she isn't pretty--she is, but it's almost like she's a blank slate. Distinctive yet malleable. This show wouldn't have a snowball's chance in Hades of succeeding without her.Moving on from Tatiana though, this show has a really fun plot as well. It's sci-fi in a way that I've never seen been done before. The sci-fi exists simply to move the plot forward. It's the basis of the show, but not really the point of the show. Sure, it's the big mystery--but the drama and meaningful plots all come from the people involved. It's a means to an end, and allows the freedom for this show to cross major boundaries. It's Desperate Housewives meets Bionic Woman while hanging out with Continuum and Lost Girl. It's drama, sci-fi, comedy, a cop show, an action show etc...I also need to mention that the method of filming was quite nice as well. It changes depending on which of the characters is on screen. It's subtle, but there and helps to establish character as well as the mood.Really engaging, really fun. Recommended for any discerning viewers out there who want to watch one of the best shows of 2013.

What's good about it?  Well, for starters Tatiana Muslany is simply amazing as the lead actress.  Muslany gets a rare opportunity to play multiple (I counted 9 of them) different characters in a single series and she just knocks it out of the park.  The show is worth watching for her performances alone.  But there is lots more to like here than just one of the best performances by any actor or actress in a long time.  The supporting cast, with only a few exceptions, is also top notch.  The suspense is pretty intense and is maintained well throughout the entire first season.  Each episode brings new and usually very unexpected twists.  This show is dark and gritty and none of the characters are even remotely saints, but it also has a good sense of humor and doesn't club you over the head with despair.  In addition to being dark and gritty, it also has significant (though not gratuitous) adult content, so if you don't care for that then this may not be the show for you.

Orphan Black provided more excitement than they would -- and delivered, amazingly, by the ever-predictable boob tube!Lead actress, Tatiana Maslany, is a genius! With each episode I am amazed at the scope of her acting range and the unpredictable nuances she offers in her portrayal of her character. Where has this woman been?!?I won't offer much more, as I don't want to spoil it for new viewers, but this is as brilliant and unexpected as Clare Danes in Homeland. They both deserve every acting award on the planet. The supporting cast is also stunning, especially Jordan Gavaris, who plays her foster brother, and Maria Doyle Kennedy playing their foster mother.Every episode will leave you breathless and, because we are not as smart as we think, WRONG about what is coming up next for Sarah, Felix and Kira!Gather food and drink around you, dim the lights and turn off your phone.

Tatiana Maslany is an amazing actress and there is no mistaking who she is when she is playing each character. I love when the clones are talking to each other! It's 100% believable that it's two (or three) people. In one scene, 3 of the clones are interacting with each other and one pours wine for the other. If you know anything about film making, you will understand that the wine pour alone is an incredibly difficult feat to pull off with one actress playing 3 parts. But they do it, and seamlessly at that!The storyline, while unbelievable in parts, totally pulls you in and makes you want more. If you want an action-packed show with twists and turns that keep you on your toes, then Orphan Black is for you! Don't miss out! Get it today! You will not be disappointed.I read some of the negative reviews, and most are mad that there is homosexuality and sexual situations (both straight and gay) in this. If that's the sort of thing that turns you off, then please do not buy it!

I caught the trailer while waiting for another movie to download and instead of skipping it after 5 seconds, which is what I usually do, I found myself excited for the launch of the series and even marked it on my calendar and I am so glad that I had.Without going into the details of the story-line to Orphan Black, (which might ruin the surprises to come) I just want to say that it is one of the most original story-lines being shown outside of the U.S. that is actually addicting to watch.  Though I have only watched the first three episodes, I find myself anxiously awaiting next week's program to see more of what is going to happen to Sarah/Beth. In the past, the only shows that have drawn me in, in this way, have been Mad Men and the Walking Dead so this gives you an idea of the type of shows I gravitate toward.If your unsure of whether or not to buy episodes to begin watching this show, I highly recommend you give it a go. I doubt you will be disappointed. I found myself hooked even after just the FIRST episode... which is strange for me since I am terribly particular with what I will religiously watch.With a great deal of fast action and a superb leading young actress, makes Orphan Black a remarkable series, even though the premise of the story is a bit on the wild-side.Please feel free to view my other TV and Movie reviews and thanks for reading this one!Cheers, Mike!",5,This show had me hooked from just the trailer!,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,1494,"['show', 'had', 'hooked', 'straight', 'off', 'JUST', 'trailer', 'caught', 'was', 'even', 'released', 'caught', 'trailer', 'waiting', 'movie', 'download', 'instead', 'skipping', '5', 'seconds', 'what', 'usually', 'do', 'found', 'excited', 'launch', 'series', 'even', 'marked', 'calendar', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'had.Without', 'going', 'details', 'story-line', 'Orphan', 'Black', 'might', 'ruin', 'surprises', 'come', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'story-lines', 'being', 'shown', 'U.S.', 'actually', 'addicting', 'watch', 'have', 'only', 'watched', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'find', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'next', 'week', 'program', 'see', 'more', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'Sarah/Beth', 'past', 'only', 'have', 'drawn', 'way', 'have', 'been', 'Mad', 'Men', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'idea', 'type', 'shows', 'gravitate', 'toward.If', 'unsure', 'not', 'buy', 'episodes', 'begin', 'watching', 'show', 'highly', 'recommend', 'give', 'go', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'found', 'hooked', 'even', 'just', 'FIRST', 'episode', 'strange', 'am', 'terribly', 'particular', 'what', 'will', 'religiously', 'watch.With', 'great', 'deal', 'fast', 'action', 'superb', 'leading', 'young', 'actress', 'Orphan', 'Black', 'remarkable', 'series', 'even', 'premise', 'story', 'bit', 'wild-side.Please', 'feel', 'free', 'view', 'other', 'TV', 'Movie', 'reviews', 'thanks', 'reading', 'one', 'Cheers', 'Mike']",Orphan Black: Season 1

I love how Orphan Black takes pains to ensure that nearly all of its characters have complex and sympathetic motives, whatever their actions may be. And among the cast, Jordan Gavaris's Felix adds just the right note of awesome comic relief to all the intrigue and bloodshed. But this show just wouldn't be as good without the astonishing Tatiana Maslany, who inhabits multiple characters so completely, with different voices, mannerisms, and body language, that you just forget they're played by the same actress. (Kudos also to her double Kathryn Alexandre, who has the thankless job of flawlessly mimicking all those performances, yet having her face digitally replaced by Maslany's in every scene they share.)

1640184,AMN9FHL5CA2SM,B00BVMXBDO,Pentaxian Dom,"[0, 0]","BBC America has long been a source of great entertainment drama geared towards adults.  An example of this was ""MI-5"", which kept me glued to the TV.  Now BBC brings us ""Orphan Black"".  Five stars is not enough to express my feelings for this show. It's billed as Sci-Fi, but don't expect ""Buck Rogers"" or ""Star Trek"".  This is a serious drama with good writing, some occasional light moments.  It's more like a Rod Serling story for ""The Twilight Zone"", another series I've always admired.The story begins with Sarah Manning (Tatiana Maslany) arriving at a train station in Ontario, Canada where she comes face to face with another young woman, Beth Childs, who looks identical to her.  Within seconds she witness the woman leap in front of an oncoming train to her death.  Sarah takes the woman's purse that she left behind and leaves the scene. She then goes to Child's apartment and proceeds to steal her identity.  Sarah is after all a street hustler who knows how to make the best of a bad situation. She learns that Beth had a bank account with $ 75,000 and she makes plans to take the money out, Beth's boyfriend Paul (Dylan Bruce) pops in and she aggressively makes love to him.  The next day ,however is a slight turn of events for Sarah.  The bank tells her she has to wait a few days to withdraw that amount of cash and while on her way out she is taken by another man who thinks she's Beth,Art Bell (Kevin Hanchard) who insists she goes with him.  It's here we learn that Beth is detective on the metropolitan police department and is up for a departmental review because of a shooting of an unarmed civilian. Can't get worse you think, Sara then meets with another woman, a red headed German look alike who is very quickly shot by sniper who almost kills Sarah/Beth. It's then that Sarah and we learn that all of the characters played Ms. Maslany are human clones. If you think I've given away the story line too much, don't worry, there are lots of twists and turns and double crosses every step of the way to hold your interest. Ms. Maslany plays all the clones that occur.  By the final episode of the season we meet 5 who are still alive.  She is brilliant in adapting different mannerisms and accents to play each role.I'm hooked on this series and can't wait for season 2 to start on April 19 on BBC America.April 8, 2014 - I am updating this review.  I have been watching it a second time and would like to comment on the various clone characters played by Tatiana Maslany.Alison Hendrix - This character is described as a ""Soccer Mom"".  She lives in suburbia with her husband and two adopted children. She's tough , gun toting who is quick to draw a weapon when threatened (or at least if she thinks she  is.) Yet despite these characteristics, she is warm and loving around her children and even Sarah's daughter Kiera.  She somehow manages to provide comic relief to the plot at times like one of the ""Desperate Housewives"" transplanted.  This is especially true when paired with ""Felix"", Sarah's flamboyantly gay foster brother.Here's a clip of the Alison character:[...]Cosima Niehaus - This is the cool head one.  A very brainy Phd candidate in ""EVO-DEVO"" (Evolutionary Development). We learn after a couple of episodes that she is lesbian (or maybe Bi).Helena - Helena is the villianess.  we learn early on in the series, she is killing off the other clones. She has all the killer qualities of someone from a ""James Bond"" movie.  Despite that we occaisionaly see a soft naive side in the series.  She is victimized by her ""Monitor"" with tortue and abuse, permitting us to feel empathy for her at times.In much the same way you would feel for James Cagney in one of his gangster movies.  Here are a couple of my favorite scenes involving Tatiana:[...][...]Sarah/ Beth = I'm pairing these two characters because I feel Ms. Maslany actually plays them as one.  Beth is really like Sarah's alter ego. Sarah becomes Beth at times even after she is know longer playing Beth. Sarah starts out only concerned with taking Beth's money and fleeing with her daughter.  As the series progresses, she winds up devoting herself to the cause of helping Alison and Cosima ,just as Beth did.The show provides us with different characters despite the fact they all have identical genetics.  this leads one to speculate that the show is advancing the theory that we are all products of our enviroment.

1640194,AV8GEO6IYIOOQ,B00BVMXBDO,PoochJD,"[1, 1]","Quite why the BBC decided to bury this brilliantly, innovative piece of Canadian drama, on the infantile network that was BBC3, and failed to promote it at all, in any way, shape or form, whilst simultaneously broadasting it only in Standard Definition (rather than in High Definition), I will never fathom or forgive them for. (HD will come to BBC3 sometime early in 2014, where I hope this show will be repeated in proper HD, where I'm certain it will look even better stil.)But for those of us who discovered it in time for Episode 1, were met with the best piece of TV I've seen in the entireity of this year! (And that includes shows like THE NEWSROOM, GAME OF THRONES, and HOMELAND!)The show follows a young woman, who arrives in Canada, only to witness the apparent suicide of a woman, who closely resembles herself. With no one around, the young woman steals her purse and handbag, and proceeds to start a new life, under the guise of the dead woman's name. What she isn't aware of, is just how wrong this decision will be, and how much of a problem this one decision will now affect her.I can't say much more than this, as I don't want to spoil it for others. I only need to say that once you hear what the major plot-twist reveal is, at the very end of Episode 2, you will firmly be on the edge of your seat, as it's truly one of the biggest and most shocking reveals I've ever witnessed on TV. Ever! (So please do not go reading other reviews for this excellent show, as once you know the twist, it really will ruin part of the greatness of this show!)Simply put, Tatiana Maslany is jaw-dropping in her role. Again, I can't say more, because the spoiler is of such a big manitude, that to say more robs you of the major point for watching this show. The fact that this is a Canadian drama, financed by BBC America, with a set of British, American and Canadian cast members is a testamount to how multi-faceted the show is. Yes, the cast's accents are ropey at times, but if you can forgive this one single issue, you will be rewarded with probably the finest TV show of the year, and certainly one of the best shows ever.This is science-fiction, but it's not spaceships and aliens. The emphasis here, is most definitely on the ""science"" part, and with a couple of memorable guest actors appearing in the final half of the Season - again, no spoilers here, as they're worth the wait of their respective shock appearances, this show is truly worthy of your time.Not since Season 1 of HOMELAND or Season 1 of THE NEWSROOM have I seen a show, so completely compelling, well-written, and incredibly shocking, as I have with ORPHAN BLACK. This has consistantly been a really high-concept, riveting piece of TV, that more than deserves to become bigger than the niche, cult show it currently is!If you haven't seen it yet, you owe it to yourself to access this show NOW! What you will end-up with is 10 truly amazing episodes of TV, and I for one, cannot wait until Season 2 gets broadcast next year - hopefully in HD and on BBC2, where it truly deserves to be shown.P.S. Why the Beeb is making UK fans wait almost 8 months for this show to arrive onto DVD and Blu-Ray, is another embarrassingly stupid decision.

The cast is superb, the basic story (though predictable and unfortunately derivative of a long running Battlestar Galactica subplot) is well constructed, the production values are high enough and I'm generally a sucker for a BBC drama. However, being able to correctly call the outcome after watching a pilot is deeply annoying and suffering through slow moving subplots involving numerous clones in the &#34;clone club&#34; when you really only care about one of them is tedious enough to render the show unwatchable for me. If you can suffer through something slower, like Mad Men, you will probably find this quite exciting. If you can't, finding instead that drama alone is not enough to hold your interest, this is not the show for you. I can't sit through Downton Abbey, for obvious reasons, and Mad Men is among my all-time favorite sleepy-time views, because nothing puts me to sleep quite like it, but this does, at least, fall somewhere short of that, putting me to sleep about a third of the time and just lulling me into getting up and cleaning the kitchen the rest of the time.

The amazing thing is that she imbues each character with its own recognizable, different persona, often in the same scene (she often has to act opposite herself).  (SPOILER ALERT) Her &#34;characters&#34; are different cloned versions which have grown up totally separate from each other.The story begins rather vaguely, following one of the characters, Sarah, leading a down-and-out life, and who, due to a bizarre incident, begins to assume the life of one of the other clones (Beth, a police detective).  Things were so hazy at first that I wasn't able to initially identify where the story was taking place (Toronto).  But, trust me, after a couple of episodes, the main framework of the story comes into clearer focus, with all the main and supporting characters in place, and &#34;Orphan Black&#34; really begins to rock.  Toronto, which is often used by U.S. film companies as a less expensive stand-in for New York, L.A., or Boston, here looks like....Camden.  This is supposed to reflect Sarah's grubby life, I guess, but it mainly comes off as cheap.  This isn't your Canada of the pristine wilderness of Alberta or Manitoba, but urban Canada, which is kind of....vanilla.Though one of the characters is a young scientist, Season 1 gets into the science of cloning hardly at all, deleting the need for any science related special effects and staying centered on being a fast-paced paranoia-based thriller.

And since it's clearly done on a budget, you have to believe it will get better as the series gets more popular.I'll stay off of the premise of the show because there are 8 billion other reviews that get into that. (Short version....woman finds out she's a clone and then tries to find out more about her 'sisters'. There, you are up to speed on the main plot.)The real joy of the show comes in the acting of Tatiana Maslany. Well, the whole cast is brilliant in their respective roles, but Maslany is PHENOMINAL in all of her 8+ roles! She plays a variety of different characters (the various clones) and despite them all looking alike Maslany gives each one of them a completely unique identiy. It's incredible how multiple characters with the same face played by the same woman can be so entirely different from one another. The range Maslany shows as an actress is absolutely incredible. It's certainly not just a wig and a different voice for each one. Each character has her own unique personality and identiy, complete with her own quirks. And Maslany never mixes up her characters.She is so good that you actually forget that the various clones are all played by the same actress! And they are incredibly different.

The show has not disappointed me once and the further into this world we go, the more interesting, frustrating, and completely fascinating it becomes. The lead actor, Tatiana Maslany, is a truly amazing, talented actress, bringing life to each character she plays convincingly, and in the process, brings forth a truly separate persona for each character. It may look like Tatiana, but when Allison Hendricks is onscreen, it's Allison onscreen, not Tatiana Maslany trying to play a character named Allison, or Cosima, or Sarah, or any of her other characters in the Orphan Black world. Each of her characters is so different, and played so well, there's just no convincing yourself that it's anyone but the character onscreen. Lots of other actors these days seem to have one character in them, and they play that one character over and over no matter who, or how different, each character is supposed to be.Add to that astounding talent of Ms. Maslany's, the solid talent of all the other actors who play characters in the show, who help to create a world that feels real. This is a show so well done it's one in which the viewer's sense of disbelief is put aside easily and keeps us coming back week after week.To finish out here, major kudos go to the show's creators, who are also the outstanding writing team, who keep us guessing and keep us anticipating the next new episode.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[1, 2]","I came to the BD version of this series, which aired on BBC America because it was recommended to me as something ""different"" with great acting. Well, it's certainly that. I warn you in advance that you won't learn much about the plot from my review because I'm not an advocate of ""spoilers"" and - honestly - the best way to approach this series is to go in knowing as little as possible, the way I did.As the first episode (pilot?) appeared on my screen - and I heard the title character's British accent, I thought - since this was a BBC series - it would take place in the UK. But it doesn't (not a spoiler here in my opinion). It takes place in America and the series was produced by a Canadian company, if I'm correct. It's got a science fiction twist to it, but there are no aliens here. I'm not a science fiction fan but this one grabbed me in the first 10 minutes. If you aren't sure if you will want the whole DVD or BD set, and can watch Amazon Instant (I can't because my ISP only offers slow DSL) then I'll suggest you watch the firsr episode on Amazon Instant and see if it doesn't grab you and encourage you to see ""what happens next?"".  Then go for the ""hard copy"" because you may want to reply a few of the scenes. Also there are the three ""bonus features""  (mostly behind the scenes featurettes and interviews) - which you should not watch until you have watched all the episodes (unless, again, you like ""spoilers"")The cast is great - especially lead actress Tatinia Maslany (an actress new to me).You should also know - if reading the reviews of this title on Amazon - that Amazon groups ALL reviews of a show in ALL formats. So if you are looking for a DVD or Bluray you should note the format the reviewe r is referring to and you might want to sort by ""Newest First"".If you like something ""out of the ordinary"" this series should interest you.

I cannot say much more about that without giving away plot details, and as a viewer you will want to savor every little discovery that comes along.  The surprises are many, both big and small, and I love all of them.  The show concept is amazing, and the attention to detail in the writing is evident throughout.We are introduced to Maslany as streetwise woman named Sarah who has a strange encounter at a train station.  She witnesses the death of a young woman who looks just like her.  Things rapidly evolve from there as we learn more about Sarah and the deceased woman.  We soon learn that Sarah lives in a world of gray, a background that will soon serve her well in the events that later unfold.The science fiction elements of the story are not immediately clear, but they start to fall into place with each new episode.  The core story is a mystery/thriller that rapidly draws the viewer in and makes you eager to find out what happens next.As amazing as the story is, I am in some ways more impressed with Maslany's performance.  She is easily half of the reason to watch this show.  Although the success of a film or TV show is often intimately related to the abilities of the lead actors, that is especially true for this show.  Fortunately, Maslany does not disappoint and consistently keeps our attention riveted on her.I would love to rave more about this show, but that can't really be done without introducing spoilers.

From that recognition moment forward, I was hooked and couldn't wait to start the next episode. Maslany's primary character is Sarah Manning, who was a foster child, where she met and befriended Jordan Garvaris's Felix Dawkins, her adopted brother. Manning swims in the lower end of the social order, where she delves and delivers dope for her seedy boy friend, Michael Mando's Vic, whose life is in peril when Sarah fails to deliver the dope to its intended recipient. Sarah was too busy inserting herself into the life of this police detective, who chose to step in front of a subway train. Being the street persons she is, Sarah stole the poor girl's identity and tried to become her, since they looked exactly alike. Why you may ask? All the Sarah looking characters are clones, and one clone is on a mission to kill all her fellow clones to eliminate the evidence of a science experiment gone wrong. It is fun stuff, and you'll find yourself getting hooked on season one, but if you're a Prime Video subscriber, you'll have to pay to see season two.

However, I don't consider the storyline 5 star worthy. It rates a decent 4 stars. Some reviewers feel the shows starts great but lags a bit as it progresses. I find the opposite to be true. By the end of this first season, I felt the story was at its best and just warming up.The best thing about this show is the lead actress, Tatiana Maslany. WOW, she is really great.
