432505,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,6304696558,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[3, 3]","Goldie Hawn is just perfect as Judy Benjamin, a young woman who is torn to pieces after the death of her husband just six hours after saying their vows.  Yes her husband dies right in the middle of making love to her.  That's enough to make anyone a little nuts.  While in this state of anxiety she calls up a local radio station under the persona of Jessica and laments about her situation.  While the radio receives dozens of callers wanting to give their advice, it's one in particular that gets Judy thinking, and with a little persuasion she up and joins the army under the false impression that she'll have her own condo and, if things prove too hard for her, she can just up and quit whenever she wants.  Little does she know, upon arriving at her base, she'll be bunked with quite a few other women (some of which are hardened criminals) and there will be no quitting for three years.Worse yet is her Captain, Doreen Lewis (Eileen Brennan) who's determination is to make Judy's stay complete hell.  Upon arriving Judy complains, she whines and fights and complains, tries to escape and, yes...complains, but after a meeting with her family and she understands just what they think of her she decides to take things a little more seriously, and she actually becomes quite good.Through the course of the film she becomes a Thornbird and then, through no fault of her own, is transferred to the international theater in France where she rekindles a relationship with a French Obi-gyn (who obviously knows what he's doing if you get my drift) and then her relationship with her Captain who just so happens to be working in the same building as Judy, still determined to make her suffer.  The remainder of the film has Judy making life altering decisions as to whether she wants to leave the army and start a life with her French lover (Armand Assante) or if she's willing to give him up for her career.The entire cast is outstanding, but especially Hawn who lights up the screen with her charm and beauty.  We all know where Kate gets it.  This is a great movie about self growth and the ability to become more than what people expect of us.  To her family Judy was always a screw-up, never making the right decisions, always needing to be bailed out of something, but throughout her stay in the army Judy became her own woman and proved to herself that she doesn't need anyone but herself.

I remember years ago when I first saw this that I laughed a lot more but I guess it's understandable as very few comedies age very well as they tend to be dated to the times that they were written for and this film is no exception.Thankfully this film is not just a comedy as it still retains its ability to entertain and amuse despite the time-decayed nature of most of the jokes because it is also a very good story about how a spoilt, dependent young woman becomes emancipated and self-confident to be better able to identify various attempts to exploit and manipulate her with her passing the final test at the end with the jerk she's supposed to marry.  Goldie Hawn shows in this film that she's not just a comedianne but that she's also a serious actress and the scenes when she is upset and reaching out for help on the radio chat show for example were quite moving.  This is the best Goldie Hawn film that I've seen.As a result, the film retains its ability to still amuse and entertain despite the poor aging of most of the gags.  Unfortunately, the quality of this dvd version of the film is very, very poor.  Both the picture (especially the picture) and sound quality are abysmal and there are no special features worth mentioning.  Fans of the film should give this particular dvd version a wide berth and wait for either a standard or Blu-ray format with much improved picture restoration and sound quality remastering with at least 5.1 surround sound options in an anamorphic widescreen format to surface.",1,Amusing and Interesting Film!

For one, the only released version of this is in Standard Pan &amp; Scan.  I know some of you out there still cling to this outmoded format, but for the rest of us, this is unacceptable.  At the very least, it should have been dual sided, with Widescreen on one side and Standard on the other.  Secondly, they've done nothing with soundtrack other than present in Dolby Stereo 2.0.  I realize that with some older titles, they don't bother to remaster the soundtrack in 5.0 (let alone DTS - the Ultimate sound format for your buck!), but I still think it's very lame that they do this.  Anyway, there is a trailer, at least, but don't expect any deleted scenes, bloopers, or any other fancy features.  The film can also be heard in French, but Spanish would also have been nice (there are at least Spanish subtitles).  They've priced this relatively low (I guess because they knew what a lame job they did with it), but I'd have preferred a bit more of a higher price if it meant little more effort on their part for this truly classic comedy.  Let's hope that &quot;Foul Play&quot; offers a lot more when it's finally released.",3,Great Film!

432522,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6304696558,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[8, 10]","Goldie Hawn has long had a knack for comedy.  ""Private Benjamin"" is one of her best comedies.  The ""Jewish Princess"" persona wears a little thin in a few places, but most of the time the comedy works well.Judy Benjamin (Hawn) has led a pampered life.  We learn this early in the movie when Judy becomes upset that the upholsterer has failed to find an obscure color for an ottoman.  The movie proceeds to develop Judy's character as that of a woman that has received excessive luxuries from everyone in her life, with the only requirement that she be obedient.  As we join the movie, it seems that Judy is about to get her life long wish.  She is about to marry a man of great promise, her parents are thrilled, and she has tons of expensive wedding gifts.  Unfortunately for Judy, the wedding night exertions are too much for her new spouse, and Judy finds herself a newlywed widow.Judy learns that she is good for little.  She is non-functional as a secretary.  Judy is spoiled to the point of absurdity.  She is unable to cook.  I doubt she knows how to clean house.  Judy realizes she needs to get her life moving along again, but she does not know how.  A fortuitous phone call has Judy visiting an Army recruiter, where she learns that modern army life is full of beautiful bases, condos, and yachts, not to mention great medical benefits.  Judy believes the recruiters picture of Army life, and heads off to basic training.Basic training is filled with the lovely accommodating people that you might anticipate.  Judy quickly learns that her recruiter misled her more than a lot.  Captain Doreen Lewis (Eileen Brennan) initially makes Judy's life a living hell.  Judy wants to quit the Army, but a visit from her parents makes Judy realize that she is tired of people pushing her around, so Judy turns into a model soldier.Judy turns misfortune into embarrassment for Captain Lewis.  Judy catches her current love interest Captain William Woodbridge (Craig T. Nelson) in a rather interesting position with a fellow recruit.  Judy and a small band of misfits manage to take guard duty of a swamp and turn it into a major embarrassment of Captain Lewis, but glory for Judy and her gang.  After Captain Lewis punishes the barracks once more for all the embarrassment she has received, Judy and her fellow recruits get their revenge with a little bit of dye.Judy's life seems to have hit a turning point.  She is in charge of herself and doing well.  She turns another embarrassing incident into a European assignment.  Judy soon finds the man of her dreams, again.  Unfortunately, Captain Lewis also has an assignment at the same facility, and she still wants to make Private Benjamin's life as difficult as possible.  Life becomes very interesting for Judy as she decides how to stay in control of her life.This movie has far more humor than my mellow review would intimate.  This movie has numerous one-liners that bring smiles all the way to serious laughs.  Judy Benjamin complains to Captain Lewis that she signed up with a different Army, the one with the condos and the yachts.  When a drill sergeant tells Private Benjamin that she is only permitted to stop running if she is puking, she does; on his shoes.  When Captain Lewis tells Judy that she is not fit to wear an Army uniform, Judy replies that she has been trying to tell her that.Goldie Hawn does an excellent job of bringing the role of Private Benjamin to life.  She performed so well that she was nominated for a Best Actress in a Leading Role.  Eileen Brennan was also outstanding, and was nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.  Both nominations were well deserved.This movie is rated R because it has several scenes that are bit risqu&eacute;.  Considering today's standards, an R rating seems a little excessive.  Regardless, this movie is not a family movie.The occasional bumpy spots in the movie are more than compensated for by the humor of the rest of the movie.  This movie is one that I watch when I want light comedy with guaranteed funny jokes.  After watching this movie a half dozen times, I suspect I will watch it many more times.

432527,AP50P603W4BA7,6304696558,"Ms. H. Sinton ""dragondrums""","[2, 2]","Goldie Hawn plays the part of Judy Benjamin, a young socialite who is widowed on her wedding night. Distraught and with no purpose to her life and no skills to speak of she appeals to the listeners of a radio show to help her. One of the respondents is an army recruitment officer who, having convinced Judy that army life really consisted of yachts and condo's and sunbathing in California, manages to get her to sign up for 3 years. This is where the comedy really starts as Judy, who has never had to lift a manicured finger, gets a reality check and discovers that being in the army is not like being on holiday. Goldie Hawn is made for this kind of role, and as usual delivers the goods. There are some genuinely 'laugh out loud' moments as she struggles to adapt and make friends. Unfortunately the film seems to run out of steam half way through. Whereas the first half is true comedy, the second half has very little in the way of humour to offer. Having met a French gynaecologist who she falls for, she wangles a posting to Paris to be with him. This is where the humour disappears as Judy leaves the army to be with him and he turns out to be a control freak that turns Judy into a clone of his ex girlfriend.

Not knowing where to go from there, she calls a radio call-in show to get advice from people.  In the end, she meets an army recruiter who tells her to enlist.  Judy does so, but only because the recruiter glamorizes the lifestyle to the point that he flat out lies.  When she gets there, she gets a rude awakening.The first half of the movie is the best half, highlighted by many slapstick fish-out-of-water scenes.  You'll laugh hysterically at them, especially the scene where she is forced off the bus.  Eileen Brennan is also great as Judy's commanding officer, a tough-as-nails and unsympathetic woman.  What makes the film far from perfect is the second half.  Judy decides to be the best soldier she can be, and becomes the best out of them all.  When that is all said and done, the movie then becomes a romantic drama with some chuckle-inducing moments, but nothing that could be considered a guffaw.  It also tends to clash with the first half of the movie, not making the movie as satisfying as it could have been.Still, despite some glaring flaws, Private Benjamin is a good movie with a good story to tell.  Unfortunately, what was probably a pretty daring look at gender rolls for its time has gotten really stale.  If you overlook that, though, the movie is very entertaining.

Doreen Lewis(Eileen Brennan)prompting her to want a quit the Army, but then Judy has a change of heart and decides to stick it out leading her to a series of adventures that eventually lead her to a promotion and a transfer to Paris, France.During Judy's time in the service, while being stationed in Europe she meets and has a short-lived romance with a dashing French doctor Henri Tremont(Armand Assante)and ends up leaving the service when Capt. Lewis gives Judy an ultimatum to choose between leaving the service and leaving Henri after Henri proposes marriage to Judy, but then Judy ends up walking out on their wedding ceremony when she discovers that Henri has been unfaithful by having an affair with his maid, but Judy also comes to the realization that she's capable of doing whatever she wants and doesn't need Henri for it either especially after Judy walks out on him at the altar to go live her own life and make a new beginning.PRIVATE BENJAMIN was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a leading role(Goldie Hawn), Best Actress in supporting role(Eileen Brennan), and Best Writing done directly for the screen in the Spring of 1981.Additionally, PRIVATE BENJAMIN was such a big smash at the box office that they had decided to make it into an Emmy and Golden Globe-winning television series using the same name, which starred Lorna Patterson as Private Judy Benjamin replacing Goldie Hawn along with Eileen Brennan reprising her role as Capt. Doreen Lewis and Hal Williams reprising his role as Sgt. L.C.

432539,AEKVNXC6R8O9G,6304696558,The philosopher,"[7, 13]","This 1980s feminist fable is about the pampered and weak JAP (Jewish-American Princess) Judy Benjamin, who wants nothing more than to be married to a rich and successful man and be able to spend lots of money.  She has been cared for by men for her entire life and has no skills, independence, or serious ambitions.  After she is widowed, she falls for a recruiter's sales pitch and joins the Army, believing that it will be like going to a spa and will help her recover from the emotional blow of her husband's death.  There is great comic potential here, but the movie lacks the sort of sharp writing that would have taken it to the next level.  Nonetheless, it obviously strikes a cord with many viewers.The first half of this film is inoffensive, sitcom-grade material.  (In fact, a sitcom based on the film ran from 1981 to 1983.)  Goldie Hawn's alternately cutesy/whiny act during basic training gets tiring quickly -- she's like a child who keeps begging for our attention -- and the film rarely manages to capitalize on the comic potential of the situations.  Still, it does set up well how her parents' visit to the Army base reminds her of their degrading treatment of her, making her resolve to be the best soldier possible.  We cheer for her to succeed.  She does, of course, becoming a strong and independent woman in the Army.The second, more serious half of the movie is somewhat more satisfying, as we watch Private Benjamin fight not to let her new French beau Henri bully her into reverting to her shallow, weak, pre-Army self.  Her romance with the despicable Henri is the most interesting part of the film, in part because Arman Assante plays his part so well: charming but condescending and unfaithful.The picture quality on the DVD is average for a film from 1980.  The DVD includes the trailer and short biographies of the major actors.  The film is captioned in several languages and can be heard with French dubbing.

Private Benjamin does absolutely nothing to fix what ain't broke, contenting itself to offer the odd slight tweak and flavoring with a mild dose of Jewish humor as Goldie Hawn's sheltered princess finds herself talked into joining the `new' army by Harry Dean Stanton's smooth-talking recruiting sergeant after husband Albert Brooks dies in the throes of passion before the honeymoon even starts (""Do you remember what the last thing he said was?"" asks his distraught mother, eliciting the reply ""I'm coming."").While it's a given that there are no surprises whatsoever, it's one of those comedies that manages to be pretty consistently funny throughout even if there aren't many really big laughs out of sheer likeability. Hawn's character is not too bright but not too Hilton with it - her character arc is not just from dependence to self-reliance but more importantly from not being able to understand why Jill Clayburgh walked out on Alan Bates in An Unmarried Woman to being able to make the same choice herself, in the process tackling sexism rather more effectively than G.I. Jane did 17 years later. Eileen Brennan is clearly having a ball as the obligatory sadistic training officer out to make her life hell and there's a quietly impressive supporting cast filling out the ranks as well as a memorable Bill Conti score. It only really misses its step slightly in the scenes where her Monsieur Right (Armand Assante) rather clumsily turns out to be Monsieur Wrong at the end, as if afraid of losing the audience's sympathy long after she's won them over, but not enough to squander the goodwill it's earned by then.",4,All present and correct,1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,2284,"['service', 'comedy', 'genre', 'almost', 'as', 'old', 'cinema', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'Victor', 'McLaglen', 'Edmund', 'Lowe', 'trenches', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'befuddling', 'sergeants', 'Carry', 'team', 'assault', 'course', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'co', 'Police', 'Academy', 'almost', 'immutable', 'formula', 'never', 'ever', 'departed', 'mildly', 'comic', 'misadventure', 'misfit', 'find', 'army/navy/air', 'force/police', 'force', 'are', 'hopelessly', 'unprepared', 'harsh', 'realities', 'basic', 'training', 'fumble', 'task', 'yet', 'somehow', 'come', 'perfect', 'soldier/sailor/airman/cop', 'prove', 'mildly', 'comic', 'baptism', 'fire', 'Private', 'Benjamin', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'fix', 'what', 'ai', ""n't"", 'broke', 'contenting', 'offer', 'odd', 'slight', 'tweak', 'flavoring', 'mild', 'dose', 'Jewish', 'humor', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'sheltered', 'princess', 'talked', 'joining', 'new', 'army', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'smooth-talking', 'recruiting', 'sergeant', 'husband', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'throes', 'passion', 'honeymoon', 'even', 'Do', 'remember', 'what', 'last', 'thing', 'said', 'was', 'distraught', 'mother', 'eliciting', 'reply', ""'m"", 'coming', 'given', 'are', 'surprises', 'whatsoever', 'one', 'comedies', 'be', 'pretty', 'consistently', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'really', 'big', 'laughs', 'sheer', 'likeability', 'Hawn', 'character', 'not', 'too', 'bright', 'not', 'too', 'Hilton', 'character', 'arc', 'not', 'just', 'dependence', 'self-reliance', 'more', 'importantly', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'understand', 'why', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'walked', 'out', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Unmarried', 'Woman', 'being', 'able', 'make', 'same', 'choice', 'process', 'tackling', 'sexism', 'rather', 'more', 'effectively', 'G.I', 'Jane', 'did', '17', 'years', 'later', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'clearly', 'having', 'ball', 'obligatory', 'sadistic', 'training', 'officer', 'make', 'life', 'hell', 'quietly', 'impressive', 'supporting', 'cast', 'filling', 'out', 'ranks', 'as', 'well', 'memorable', 'Bill', 'Conti', 'score', 'only', 'really', 'step', 'slightly', 'scenes', 'where', 'Monsieur', 'Right', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'rather', 'clumsily', 'out', 'be', 'Monsieur', 'Wrong', 'end', 'afraid', 'losing', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'long', 'won', 'over', 'not', 'enough', 'squander', 'goodwill', 'earned', 'then']",N/A
