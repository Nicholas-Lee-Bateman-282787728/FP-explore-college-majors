He does a great job.  But, that is where it stops!Barry is a good looking guy, however, this film does not show him off and Barry keeps his shirt on.  O well!

683568,A15G57AIKJ5PRQ,B00005U8EQ,"A. C. Walter ""awalter""","[0, 0]","""When Strangers Appear"" (2001) is just the sort of film I'm a sucker for.  It's a tense, neo-Hitchcockian thriller with a crisp, clean visual style, a forceful sense of place, several great suspense sequences, very effective camera work, and one hell of a paranoid mood.  The story concerns a young woman who for 48 hours becomes entangled in a mysterious manhunt when her path crosses with the wrong people on the Oregon coast.  Or, as I really like to tell folks, it's about a waitress being chased by diabolical surfers.The film was written and directed by New Zealand director Scott Reynolds.  For me his first film, ""The Ugly,"" was close to unwatchable, but then he released ""Heaven,"" which showed a lot of promise.  (And with any luck he'll break his 6-year dry spell and bring us something else soon.)  Radha Mitchell and Josh Lucas are both very, very good in ""When Strangers Appear,"" as is Kevin Anderson in his supporting role.  The film has a few flaws, however.  This includes a few too-self-conscious moments and the casting of Barry Watson as Jack, the man on the run.  Still, the film is a must-see for fans of tense contemporary thrillers that lie in the shadow of Hitch, or for anyone who's up for the sort of gripping, old-fashioned good time provided by films like ""Red Rock West,"" ""Nick of Time,"" and ""Breakdown.""",4,gripping neo-Hitchcockian thriller,1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,1333,"['When', 'Strangers', 'Appear', '2001', 'just', 'sort', 'film', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'tense', 'neo-Hitchcockian', 'thriller', 'crisp', 'clean', 'visual', 'style', 'forceful', 'sense', 'place', 'several', 'great', 'suspense', 'sequences', 'very', 'effective', 'camera', 'work', 'one', 'hell', 'paranoid', 'mood', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'who', '48', 'hours', 'becomes', 'entangled', 'mysterious', 'manhunt', 'when', 'path', 'crosses', 'wrong', 'people', 'Oregon', 'coast', 'really', 'tell', 'folks', 'waitress', 'being', 'chased', 'diabolical', 'surfers.The', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'New', 'Zealand', 'director', 'Scott', 'Reynolds', 'first', 'film', 'Ugly', 'was', 'close', 'unwatchable', 'then', 'released', 'Heaven', 'showed', 'lot', 'promise', 'luck', ""'ll"", 'break', '6-year', 'dry', 'spell', 'bring', 'something', 'else', 'soon', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'When', 'Strangers', 'Appear', 'Kevin', 'Anderson', 'supporting', 'role', 'film', 'few', 'flaws', 'however', 'few', 'too-self-conscious', 'moments', 'casting', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'Jack', 'man', 'run', 'Still', 'film', 'must-see', 'fans', 'tense', 'contemporary', 'thrillers', 'lie', 'shadow', 'Hitch', 'anyone', 'who', 'up', 'sort', 'gripping', 'old-fashioned', 'good', 'time', 'provided', 'films', 'Red', 'Rock', 'West', 'Nick', 'Time', 'Breakdown']",When Strangers Appear

This film has a &quot;Psycho&quot; feeling to it, with all the camera shots, dialogue types. This is very evident at the very beginning. We're in a country kitchen in the middle of nowhere, it's almost eight o'clock, and there is absolutely nobody except for this young and attractive waitress. But, the tension climbs high up just five seconds later, as a mysterious young man enters the eatery. And, indeed, the whole story is about the mystery of this man, who claims himself to be hiding from his friends. The storyboard is quite interesting, in addition to having a known feeling to it, as a thriller-fan would sense it immediately. Yet it is good.The direction is meticulously done. Juxtapositions in tension scenes are indeed excitement-stressing, such as the young man's dealing with his wound in the most ungentle fashion and the coffee droplets dripping from the coffee machine, making a 'bizzzz' on the metal surface.Blood, which is a part of most thriller films, is well used. It's not excesive; it's minimally used, yet very efficiently. I think it&quot;s the fear on the victims that thrill us more, and not the blood.The end is very interesting. I mean not the end of the story, but the end of the film... I will not tell you, because you really have to see it.

683570,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00005U8EQ,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[0, 0]","Watching this film is not a difficult thing.  Theres enough going for it that it will hold your interest.  With likable charactors like Beth (Mitchell) that overshadow that annoying charactors like Jack (Watson) you are bound to enjoy most of the film.  My only pet peves are that most of the plot, and even the sub-plots, are never fully explored.  When Jack arrives at Beths diner he's worn out, bleeding and frightened.  When Peter (Lucas) arrives looking for Jack he's the complete opposite.  He's clean and calm.  Beth is confused.  Is this Jack guy crazy or rightfully and justifiably on the run.  And then there's Brice, the cop who raped Beth and his crazy wife who harrases Beth constantly.  And there's the doctor Eric who Beth asks to help Jack.  Theres problems with all of this.  They never really explain what really happened between Beth and Brice, they never tell you why Eric and Beth are so close (Beth says somthing about Eric being there for her when no one else was...what in the hell is she talking about???) and the biggest problem is that while they explain that Peter and his buddies are after a disc that Jack has they never explain what is on the disc...I mean, what do three slacker surfing bums want with a disc.  I think the writer couldn't come up with a good enough ending or even a plot and so he said, lets end it with some eplosions and $hit and then we won't have to explain anything...What saves this movie it the acting.  I think that Rahha Mitchell is an excilent actress (See Melinda and Melinda) and Josh Lucas always possesses that cool and colected air about him.  Barry Watson has never impressed me and he just upset me in this movie.  His charactor was so unstable and jumpy that it was unrealistic.  Expecially the scene in the diner when Peter and his friends enter for the first time.  Jack is behind the counter with Beth and he;s telling her how these guys want to kill him and he doesnt want her to say anything but he;s so loud and pretty much in plain sight...it's just rediculous.

683571,A39AZT0WDM8AC9,B00005U8EQ,KEVIN BRIAN,"[1, 2]","Just finished watching this on Showtime. I'm not into the 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Dust to Dawn' Tarantino-ish kind of action films and this sort of fits in that genre.  The thing that really 'bugged' the hell out of me was the narrative of the story.There were these 'gaps' and I mean, freakin' giant 'gaps' throughout the film that made the flow seem 'episodic' and terribly paced.  It's like 'commercials' should of been placed where the story suddenly fades,or jumps to a new scene, oddly zapping the main characters into a totally new situation. You literally have to 'connect the dots' with quick flashbacks, or listen to the characters explain 'what the hell' just happened.Of course, or at least I hope (!),that this was the intention that the director, and editor wanted. You know,to 'self indulge' themselves, trying to make the movie more cryptic and way kooler than it actually is.I thought this style really worked in the teen, pulp-fiction like comedy ""Go"" but in this,for me, it just didn't need it. It's a simple little thriller that has it's heart in the right place, but is dressed up with too many 'flashbacks' and 'plot twists'.Spunky waitress meets a dangerous (or is he?) fugitive, befriends a good-looking, friendly (or is he?) drifter with two loser buddies and later teams up with the town sheriff (who's also a rapist! Huh?)in a subplot that goes nowhere.Now I will admit,that the film does look incredibly gorgeous and has a 'feverish' sunny kind of hypontic appeal and Josh Lucas looks stunning. His blue eyes, and dashing mysterious charm is worth the peek alone, and there's a scene at the very end, (after the climactic showdown, and 'only in the movies' kind of explosion of an old road side gas station) with lead actress Radha Mitchell that is pretty darn cute. But in a Tarantino...ain't this movie soooo kool....kinda way. That's just my opinion!

The whole style of the film serves to keep you off-balance and it works wonderfully; i haven't been this engaged by a film in a long time; I really wanted to know what was going on...and I was not disappointed at all in the way this film wraps things up. It has a trio of excellent performances from 3 up and coming actors: the radiantly tough Radha Mitchell, the awesome (as always) Josh Lucas and (after escaping the purgatory of 7TH HEAVEN) Barry Watson; all perform very capably and help sell this films many pleasures.

683575,A1HS9F7J51E9CB,B00005U8EQ,sweetmolly,"[11, 11]","This made-on-a-shoestring film delivers a wallop. I went in with no expectations and was instantly drawn into the compelling opening scenes, and the razor sharp acting by the young cast.The movie opens with Beth (Radha Mitchell) striding purposefully down a dusty highway. She is furious when a car speeds past her leaving her in a cloud of dust without offering her a ride. She arrives at a surprising spacious, super hygienic diner that she opens for business.  Imaginative quick shots follow of her filling the condiment containers, starting the coffee, turning on the lights highlighting the boredom and repetitiousness of her life.  Enter the driver of the car who passed her by, Jack (Barry Wilson) greasy haired, frail, shaky and obviously broke and hungry. Beth warily jokes with him and feels empathy toward this polite young man; she has obviously had troubles of her own.  Jack claims that three surfers are after him, trying to kill him.  He clearly is frightened and has a serious wound in his side. While he is telling his story, the &quot;surfers&quot; drive up. In a panic, he draws a knife and hides.  The three, led by Daniel (Josh Lucas, the only actor I recognized: &quot;Sweet Home Alabama,&quot; &quot;Hulk&quot;) said they were on their way to the nearby beach.  Daniel in particular was charming, funny and sweet.  They admitted they were looking for a drifter who they claimed had broken into their car and robbed them. That's the setup, and Beth (and the viewer) spend two-thirds of the movie trying to figure out who to believe. Violence, terror, and things that-go-bump-in-the-night escalate until the tension is unbearable.The pacing is relentless and for me, the movie went by in a flash.  Excellent directing by Scott Reynolds who I understand has made other fine, quirky, low budget films. &quot;When Strangers Appear&quot; doesn't answer all your questions.  It never tells you exactly what, if anything, was stolen or whether the drifter or the surfers might be disguised agents of some government, maybe our own.  I do not consider this a flaw.  It was just one more thing to ponder over. A minor annoyance was the &quot;Oregon&quot; locale. The movie was shot in some Commonwealth country; the road and informational signs were a dead giveaway.  The lack of extras (probably a budget consideration) was a plus; it focused the intensity on the main players and heightened the sense of alienation.&quot;When Strangers Appear&quot; is excellent entertainment.  I recommend buying it for your home library if you are not adverse to a scare or two or three.-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer",4,Tidy Little Thriller,1057190400,"07 3, 2003",2003,2615,"['made-on-a-shoestring', 'film', 'delivers', 'wallop', 'went', 'expectations', 'was', 'instantly', 'drawn', 'compelling', 'opening', 'scenes', 'razor', 'sharp', 'acting', 'young', 'cast.The', 'movie', 'Beth', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'striding', 'purposefully', 'down', 'dusty', 'highway', 'furious', 'when', 'car', 'speeds', 'leaving', 'cloud', 'dust', 'offering', 'ride', 'surprising', 'spacious', 'super', 'hygienic', 'diner', 'business', 'Imaginative', 'quick', 'shots', 'follow', 'filling', 'condiment', 'containers', 'starting', 'coffee', 'turning', 'lights', 'highlighting', 'boredom', 'repetitiousness', 'life', 'Enter', 'driver', 'car', 'who', 'passed', 'Jack', 'Barry', 'Wilson', 'greasy', 'haired', 'frail', 'shaky', 'obviously', 'broke', 'hungry', 'Beth', 'warily', 'feels', 'empathy', 'polite', 'young', 'man', 'obviously', 'had', 'troubles', 'own', 'Jack', 'three', 'surfers', 'are', 'trying', 'kill', 'clearly', 'frightened', 'serious', 'wound', 'side', 'telling', 'story', 'quot', 'surfers', 'quot', 'drive', 'up', 'panic', 'knife', 'hides', 'three', 'led', 'Daniel', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'only', 'actor', 'recognized', 'quot', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'quot', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'said', 'were', 'way', 'nearby', 'beach', 'Daniel', 'particular', 'was', 'charming', 'funny', 'sweet', 'admitted', 'were', 'looking', 'drifter', 'who', 'claimed', 'had', 'broken', 'car', 'robbed', 'setup', 'Beth', 'viewer', 'spend', 'two-thirds', 'movie', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'believe', 'Violence', 'terror', 'things', 'that-go-bump-in-the-night', 'escalate', 'tension', 'unbearable.The', 'pacing', 'relentless', 'movie', 'went', 'flash', 'Excellent', 'directing', 'Scott', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'understand', 'made', 'other', 'fine', 'quirky', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'quot', 'When', 'Strangers', 'Appear', 'quot', ""n't"", 'answer', 'questions', 'never', 'exactly', 'what', 'anything', 'was', 'stolen', 'drifter', 'surfers', 'might', 'be', 'disguised', 'agents', 'government', 'maybe', 'own', 'do', 'not', 'consider', 'flaw', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'ponder', 'over', 'minor', 'annoyance', 'was', 'quot', 'Oregon', 'quot', 'locale', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'Commonwealth', 'country', 'road', 'informational', 'signs', 'were', 'dead', 'giveaway', 'lack', 'extras', 'probably', 'budget', 'consideration', 'was', 'plus', 'focused', 'intensity', 'main', 'players', 'heightened', 'sense', 'alienation.', 'quot', 'When', 'Strangers', 'Appear', 'quot', 'excellent', 'entertainment', 'recommend', 'buying', 'home', 'library', 'are', 'not', 'adverse', 'scare', 'two', 'three.-sweetmolly-Amazon', 'Reviewer']",When Strangers Appear
683576,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005U8EQ,trebe,"[4, 4]","When Strangers Appear, is the kind of movie that can suck you in, and take you along for a suspenseful, and unpredictable journey.  Written and directed by Scott Reynolds, the film is an Australian production, set in of all places, Oregon.  The plot unfolds, taking twists and turns, designed to keep you guessing.  The film features no big stars, but contains solid performances by the entire cast.  Ultimately how much you may enjoy it, may depend on your tolerance for ambiguity.  If you need to have total clarity and resolution, you may not be satisfied with the ending.  Saying too much, about exactly what happens, would ruin it for those who have not yet seen the movie, but here are some peripheral comments.Radha Mitchell, is an actress with talent.  She was great in ...Pitch Black..., and also plays a strong woman here.  Her performance is believable, and rings true throughout.  No cheap laughs, or throwaway lines.  Her character ""Beth"", is busy running two businesses.  By day, a tiny dinner, and at night, she manages a motel.  Barry Watson, gives an edgy performance as a furtive and suspicious drifter who shows up at the diner, claiming that people are after him.  Josh Lucas plays a helpful ""surfer"", one who's concerned about Beth.  And Kevin Anderson plays the local lawman, a guy who apparently has problems controlling himself around women, especially Beth.When Strangers Appear, is an interesting film, with some quirky choices in editing.  It starts a bit slow, but the level of violence escalates, at times quite surprisingly.  The plot twists keep you guessing, and in the end, you don't know exactly what it was all for.  There are some major problems with time sequencing during a standoff scene at the diner, where it goes from noon to dusk in just a few minutes.  Also, cars seem to suddenly and silently, appear out of nowhere, a bit too often.  The foreign locales could pass for Oregon, unless perhaps you're an expert on trees of the Pacific Northwest.  A couple of minor characters, do seem to have a hint of Aussie type accents.  The post end credit ""post script"" doesn't add anything.  Though far from perfect, it is still a thriller well worth your time.  Radha Mitchell continues to show that she is an actress with much potential.The DVD contains both widescreen and full screen versions of the movie.  The extras are minimal, and the subtitling is not true to the actual dialog.",4,What&#65533;s all the fuss about?,1030924800,"09 2, 2002",2002,2422,"['When', 'Strangers', 'Appear', 'kind', 'movie', 'can', 'suck', 'take', 'along', 'suspenseful', 'unpredictable', 'journey', 'Written', 'directed', 'Scott', 'Reynolds', 'film', 'Australian', 'production', 'set', 'places', 'Oregon', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'taking', 'twists', 'turns', 'designed', 'keep', 'guessing', 'film', 'big', 'stars', 'solid', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'Ultimately', 'how', 'much', 'may', 'enjoy', 'may', 'depend', 'tolerance', 'ambiguity', 'need', 'have', 'total', 'clarity', 'resolution', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'satisfied', 'ending', 'Saying', 'too', 'much', 'about', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'ruin', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'movie', 'here', 'are', 'peripheral', 'comments.Radha', 'Mitchell', 'actress', 'talent', 'was', 'great', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'also', 'strong', 'woman', 'here', 'performance', 'believable', 'rings', 'true', 'cheap', 'throwaway', 'lines', 'character', 'Beth', 'busy', 'running', 'two', 'businesses', 'day', 'tiny', 'dinner', 'night', 'motel', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'edgy', 'performance', 'furtive', 'suspicious', 'drifter', 'who', 'up', 'diner', 'claiming', 'people', 'are', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'helpful', 'surfer', 'one', 'who', 'concerned', 'Beth', 'Kevin', 'Anderson', 'local', 'lawman', 'guy', 'who', 'apparently', 'problems', 'controlling', 'women', 'especially', 'Beth.When', 'Strangers', 'Appear', 'interesting', 'film', 'quirky', 'choices', 'editing', 'bit', 'slow', 'level', 'violence', 'escalates', 'times', 'quite', 'surprisingly', 'plot', 'keep', 'guessing', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'are', 'major', 'problems', 'time', 'sequencing', 'standoff', 'scene', 'diner', 'where', 'noon', 'dusk', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'Also', 'cars', 'seem', 'suddenly', 'silently', 'appear', 'nowhere', 'bit', 'too', 'often', 'foreign', 'locales', 'could', 'pass', 'Oregon', 'perhaps', ""'re"", 'expert', 'trees', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'A', 'couple', 'minor', 'characters', 'do', 'seem', 'have', 'hint', 'Aussie', 'type', 'accents', 'post', 'end', 'credit', 'post', 'script', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'far', 'perfect', 'still', 'thriller', 'well', 'time', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'show', 'actress', 'much', 'potential.The', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'full', 'screen', 'versions', 'movie', 'extras', 'are', 'minimal', 'subtitling', 'not', 'true', 'actual', 'dialog']",When Strangers Appear

It had NOTHING good in it whatsoever.Glitches in the movie--Why was there only one sheriff?  Even in small towns, there's usually a sheriff and a deputy.Why would the police officer just stop the car in the middle of the road to talk?  People can talk while driving...DUH!On foot, Beth never would have escaped from those crooks.Also, why didn't they show us what was on the disk?  After making us endure a terrible movie, they should have at least shown us what was on the disk.The movie had a poorly thought-out ending.The movie was gory.  It's so revolting how those three guys were able to get away with killing a lot of people for so long.This movie was a waste of film.
