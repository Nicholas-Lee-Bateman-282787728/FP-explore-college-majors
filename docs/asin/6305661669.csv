Although there is a linearness to using one leg at a time during the initial standing pose sequence, keep in mind this is balanced with deep squatting and twisting.  I think the quick salutation pace really builds heat in the body, making this one of the most aerobic of the power yoga DVD's I own.  I particularly love the complex four part single leg standing sequence.  It seems that the raven pose is all I need to tighten up and firm my abs.

This DVD from The Yoga Zone is very much like those classes with emphasis on vinyasa flow, chair and the warrior poses. The routine does provide a challenging series of difficult poses. It is a good idea having one of the participants performing lower impact versions of the poses as an alternate for viewers.The pace of the video is fast. I sometimes chose to linger in a pose, usually up dog, rather than rush through the vinyasa. The practice begins with the vinyasa sequence rather than providing a few minutes of warm up poses like spinal balance, cat and cow. It would have been nice to include these more basic poses before getting into the more challenging ones.  It would have been nice to mix up dog with cobra for the sake of variety.Lisa Bennett is an excellent teacher and the flow of her poses is very good. She offers some good tips about the poses. I would not say that this DVD should be used by someone new to yoga. I started taking basic yoga classes and graduated myself over time to the more advanced classes. Yoga is not the easy relaxation exercise that many people think it is and can be very challenging.

It was great that they were bringing yoga to a larger audience, but the yoga from their television shows seemed very watered down.  I waited until this video was recommended by two people before giving it a try.The first time I did this I sweat buckets.  What really revs this workout up is the chairs and twisted prayers which are held for what first seemed like an eternity.  Those asanas are part of an extended sun salutation which progressively builds.  You start with warrior 1, then move into warrior 1, warrior 2.  This continues until you have built into warrior 1, warrior 2, right angle, crescent, triangle.  Throughout, you are interspersing the chairs and twisted prayers.  Following the sun salutation are several balancing poses.  They don't look that challenging on preview, but when your legs are quivering, you feel it.This is a nice, challenging video, and I enjoy Lisa Bennett's instructions and tips, particularly to pay attention to the breath and not push yourself beyond a flowing breath.  However, it would have been great if the video had begun with instruction on ujjayi breath and ended with a longer guided relaxation.  This would have put the tape at over an hour, though, and maybe they were trying to keep it brief.I would recommend this tape for being familiar with the breathing; however, beginners should try the Total Yoga series to get acquainted with the basics.",4,More strenuous than it looks,1023408000,"06 7, 2002",2002,1473,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'admit', 'video', 'had', 'attitude', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'was', 'great', 'were', 'bringing', 'yoga', 'larger', 'audience', 'yoga', 'television', 'shows', 'seemed', 'very', 'watered', 'waited', 'video', 'was', 'recommended', 'two', 'people', 'giving', 'try.The', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'sweat', 'buckets', 'What', 'really', 'revs', 'workout', 'up', 'chairs', 'twisted', 'prayers', 'are', 'held', 'what', 'first', 'seemed', 'eternity', 'asanas', 'are', 'part', 'extended', 'sun', 'salutation', 'progressively', 'start', 'warrior', '1', 'then', 'move', 'warrior', '1', 'warrior', '2', 'have', 'built', 'warrior', '1', 'warrior', '2', 'right', 'angle', 'crescent', 'triangle', 'Throughout', 'are', 'interspersing', 'chairs', 'twisted', 'prayers', 'Following', 'sun', 'salutation', 'are', 'several', 'balancing', 'poses', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'challenging', 'preview', 'when', 'legs', 'are', 'quivering', 'feel', 'it.This', 'nice', 'challenging', 'video', 'enjoy', 'Lisa', 'Bennett', 'instructions', 'tips', 'particularly', 'pay', 'attention', 'breath', 'not', 'push', 'flowing', 'breath', 'However', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'video', 'had', 'begun', 'instruction', 'ujjayi', 'breath', 'ended', 'longer', 'guided', 'relaxation', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'tape', 'hour', 'maybe', 'were', 'trying', 'keep', 'brief.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'tape', 'being', 'familiar', 'breathing', 'however', 'beginners', 'should', 'try', 'Total', 'Yoga', 'series', 'get', 'acquainted', 'basics']",N/A

From my perspective, I saw little or none of the infomercial tone some reviewers commented on.  Perhaps previous negative experience with other Yoga Zone productions sensitized some viewers.  I also found the warm-up at the beginning of the disc quite sufficient to build heat, especially if practiced in a room that is heated and/or not over air-conditioned.  Also, viewers should of course take it easy with the first few poses till they warm up.Overall, the disc contains a clean, relatively simple flow-oriented routine which does a nice job of building heat and deep breathing.  There are relatively few of the more complex standing or seated postures, but the postures that are included are entered into in unusual and interesting ways.The disc includes a standing one-leg balance with a twist, which is not very common on yoga videos.  It also includes sequences in which you move from a twisting chair (thunderbolt) position back into a twisting lunge.  This presents a new challenge and brings the body into the position in a way that opens up new sensation and insight into the posture.For the money, this is a simple, enjoyable, challenging and very rewarding routine that is well worth checking out.  It is accessible and challenging at the same time, which is nice.  This will allow many viewers to have a great yoga experience without getting caught up in the details of a lot of unfamiliar poses.  Experienced yogis will like the chance to flow through a clean routine and build heat.I was surprised at how much my wife and I enjoyed it.",5,An Underestimated Video that is Actually Excellent,1095033600,"09 13, 2004",2004,1615,"['think', 'disc', 'better', 'comments', 'would', 'suggest', 'perspective', 'saw', 'little', 'none', 'infomercial', 'tone', 'reviewers', 'commented', 'Perhaps', 'previous', 'negative', 'experience', 'other', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'productions', 'sensitized', 'viewers', 'also', 'found', 'warm-up', 'beginning', 'disc', 'quite', 'sufficient', 'build', 'heat', 'especially', 'practiced', 'room', 'heated', 'and/or', 'not', 'air-conditioned', 'Also', 'viewers', 'should', 'course', 'take', 'easy', 'first', 'few', 'poses', 'till', 'warm', 'up.Overall', 'disc', 'clean', 'relatively', 'simple', 'flow-oriented', 'routine', 'nice', 'job', 'building', 'heat', 'deep', 'breathing', 'are', 'relatively', 'few', 'more', 'complex', 'standing', 'seated', 'postures', 'postures', 'are', 'included', 'are', 'entered', 'unusual', 'interesting', 'ways.The', 'disc', 'standing', 'one-leg', 'balance', 'twist', 'not', 'very', 'common', 'yoga', 'videos', 'also', 'sequences', 'move', 'twisting', 'chair', 'thunderbolt', 'position', 'back', 'twisting', 'lunge', 'new', 'challenge', 'body', 'position', 'way', 'up', 'new', 'sensation', 'insight', 'posture.For', 'money', 'simple', 'enjoyable', 'challenging', 'very', 'rewarding', 'routine', 'well', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'accessible', 'challenging', 'same', 'time', 'nice', 'will', 'allow', 'many', 'viewers', 'have', 'great', 'yoga', 'experience', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'details', 'lot', 'unfamiliar', 'poses', 'Experienced', 'yogis', 'will', 'like', 'chance', 'flow', 'clean', 'routine', 'build', 'heat.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'wife', 'enjoyed']",N/A

Most of the poses are not pass the intermediate level.  The body is given a through stretch through slow repetition versus speed (i.e. MTV's Power Yoga and Rodney Yee's Power Yoga dvds).Overall, the workout is slow and intense.  Please note that by slow I mean that the poses are held for a while, and the pace is not as aerobic as some of the other popular Power Yoga tapes, but you will still build up a meaningful sweat.

It's very intense and does the work you need!!  I wish that Yoga zone would make another Power Yoga DVD similar to this one and incorporate more difficult standing postures for the legs and glutes in a 50 to 60 minute session.

472354,A10X0JN8KTK89H,6305661669,ninjasuperstar,"[4, 4]","The best part of the Yoga Zone series is the level of instruction in how to perform the poses.  Alan Finger and his crew understand that mere observation and vague, vapid monologues about relaxation and breathing do not sufficiently explain yoga poses and practices.  Yoga Zone instructors do point out how yoga can lead to inner harmony and abstract notions of spirituality and being, but the majority of the series is spent telling and showing you how to perform yoga safely, emphasizing that yoga is not about competition with others, but with the self.  Some instructors are better than others, and some routines feel like repetitions of other DVDs.  I am writing this introduction to all of the Yoga Zone DVDs I own.  The following pertains to this particular DVD.Yoga Zone's Power Yoga for Strength and Endurance can be very challenging for yoga beginners, those who have weak legs and a weak back, and especially for those who are overweight.  The routine is divided into two sections - one that builds heat and strength in your system and one that challenges your balance.  The overall routine relies heavily on the muscular strength and endurance of one's legs.  Expect to get sweaty doing this program.  The poses and exercises are performed in full and modified forms, but one should be aware that the modified forms are not necessarily easy.  I have lost seven pounds since beginning this program, and the extra weight I started with made some of the poses difficult to perform.  As I lost weight (and my stomach and waistline decreased), I began to be more comfortable while doing the routine.The instructor is Lisa Bennett.  She has a pleasant voice and explains poses thoroughly (if a bit quickly).  She seems like a real person and does not speak over your head or get all mystical.  After all, power yoga is work, and one needs an encouraging coach to perform work, not a spiritual leader (which is often appropriate for other kinds of yoga routines).  Lisa Bennett is definitely a good coach and instructor, and this DVD is a fine addition to your yoga video collection.",5,"Powerful, Moderately Difficult, and Rewarding",1141344000,"03 3, 2006",2006,2088,"['best', 'part', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'series', 'level', 'instruction', 'how', 'perform', 'poses', 'Alan', 'Finger', 'crew', 'understand', 'mere', 'observation', 'vague', 'vapid', 'monologues', 'relaxation', 'breathing', 'do', 'not', 'sufficiently', 'explain', 'yoga', 'poses', 'practices', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'instructors', 'do', 'point', 'out', 'how', 'yoga', 'can', 'lead', 'inner', 'harmony', 'abstract', 'notions', 'spirituality', 'being', 'majority', 'series', 'spent', 'telling', 'showing', 'how', 'perform', 'yoga', 'safely', 'emphasizing', 'yoga', 'not', 'competition', 'others', 'self', 'instructors', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'routines', 'feel', 'repetitions', 'other', 'DVDs', 'am', 'writing', 'introduction', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'DVDs', 'own', 'following', 'pertains', 'particular', 'DVD.Yoga', 'Zone', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Strength', 'Endurance', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'challenging', 'yoga', 'beginners', 'who', 'have', 'weak', 'legs', 'weak', 'back', 'especially', 'who', 'are', 'overweight', 'routine', 'divided', 'two', 'sections', 'one', 'heat', 'strength', 'system', 'one', 'balance', 'overall', 'routine', 'relies', 'heavily', 'muscular', 'strength', 'endurance', 'one', 'legs', 'Expect', 'get', 'sweaty', 'doing', 'program', 'poses', 'exercises', 'are', 'performed', 'full', 'modified', 'forms', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'modified', 'forms', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'easy', 'have', 'lost', 'seven', 'pounds', 'beginning', 'program', 'extra', 'weight', 'started', 'made', 'poses', 'difficult', 'perform', 'lost', 'weight', 'stomach', 'waistline', 'decreased', 'began', 'be', 'more', 'comfortable', 'doing', 'routine.The', 'instructor', 'Lisa', 'Bennett', 'pleasant', 'voice', 'poses', 'thoroughly', 'bit', 'quickly', 'real', 'person', 'not', 'speak', 'head', 'get', 'mystical', 'power', 'yoga', 'work', 'one', 'encouraging', 'coach', 'perform', 'work', 'not', 'spiritual', 'leader', 'often', 'appropriate', 'other', 'kinds', 'yoga', 'routines', 'Lisa', 'Bennett', 'definitely', 'good', 'coach', 'instructor', 'DVD', 'fine', 'addition', 'yoga', 'video', 'collection']",N/A

It's 55 minutes in length, and you'll be burning calories from the start. Now I speak as an intermediate yoga student, so for those of you that have been at it for years, and are at the advanced level, or consider yourselves &#34;yogis&#34; this may be just another day of practice for you. I'm 5'4, and 194 lbs., so maybe that's why I sweat. They say yoga doesn't burn that many calories, or isn't as effective as a regular cardio workout, but I beg to differ; I FEEL like I've worked out after this video. It's done outside on the grass, which I love, cause I hate yoga videos filmed in a studio. Well, except for a yoga video I have by Kathryn Budig, which is done in a beautiful, open, high ceiling, indoor/outdoor loft style space that's well lit and somehow just makes me feel instantly peaceful, but that's an exception. I actually prefer all my yoga DVDs on a beach location, but I'm learning to be more flexible. This instructor is mature, well versed and pleasant, with two people accompanying her during the practice. She doesn't rush through poses, and never makes you push your body further than it can go.  You can tell by what they're wearing it's a little dated, but just ignore that in exchange for how you'll feel when you're done!",5,Prepare to sweat.....,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,1356,"['video', 'definite', 'workout', 'need', 'easy', 'breezy', 'yoga', 'more', 'meditative', ""n't"", 'one', '55', 'minutes', 'length', ""'ll"", 'be', 'burning', 'calories', 'start', 'Now', 'speak', 'intermediate', 'yoga', 'student', 'so', 'have', 'been', 'years', 'are', 'advanced', 'level', 'consider', 'yourselves', '34', 'yogis', '34', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'day', 'practice', ""'m"", '5', '4', '194', 'lbs.', 'so', 'maybe', 'why', 'sweat', 'say', 'yoga', ""n't"", 'burn', 'many', 'calories', ""n't"", 'as', 'effective', 'regular', 'cardio', 'workout', 'beg', 'differ', 'FEEL', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'out', 'video', 'done', 'outside', 'grass', 'love', 'cause', 'hate', 'yoga', 'videos', 'filmed', 'studio', 'Well', 'yoga', 'video', 'have', 'Kathryn', 'Budig', 'done', 'beautiful', 'open', 'high', 'ceiling', 'indoor/outdoor', 'loft', 'style', 'space', 'well', 'lit', 'somehow', 'just', 'feel', 'instantly', 'peaceful', 'exception', 'actually', 'prefer', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'beach', 'location', ""'m"", 'learning', 'be', 'more', 'flexible', 'instructor', 'mature', 'well', 'versed', 'pleasant', 'two', 'people', 'accompanying', 'practice', ""n't"", 'rush', 'poses', 'never', 'push', 'body', 'further', 'can', 'go', 'can', 'tell', 'what', ""'re"", 'wearing', 'little', 'dated', 'just', 'ignore', 'exchange', 'how', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'when', ""'re"", 'done']",N/A
