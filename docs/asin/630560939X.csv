This is one of the first movies that I have seen related to Phantom of the Opera. When I was younger I was enchanted by it.I liked the fact that we didn't see Erik's face when he showed it to Christine. That was a good move I believe.However, there are some things about the movie that I didn't really enjoy. They could have  tried to get different actress for Christine and Erik's mother ( it's disturbing when you think about it.)I guess they didn't want to because they wanted to show exactly why Erik is so interested in Christine.The twist of Erik's father being in the film was interesting and kind of disappointing at the same time.I liked the chemistry between the two actors. And you could tell that Erik's father does love his son.However, again not really a Phantom plot line at all.All and all though it was a very good attempt for a new Phantom film at the time.  My one thought is to try out Susan Kay's novel ""Phantom"". Another Phantom of the Opera retelling.Very nice.This movie is good but not really on my favorite list any more. It's good for romance lovers that like semi sad themes , that aren't really well developed.Either way it was a very interesting and good attempt for another Phantom of the Opera multimedia mix.",3,Intersting Phantom Remake,1082419200,"04 20, 2004",2004,1311,"['are', 'quiet', 'few', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'retold', 'stories', 'days', 'one', 'first', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'related', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'When', 'was', 'younger', 'was', 'enchanted', 'it.I', 'liked', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Erik', 'face', 'when', 'showed', 'Christine', 'was', 'good', 'move', 'believe.However', 'are', 'things', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'could', 'have', 'tried', 'get', 'different', 'actress', 'Christine', 'Erik', 'mother', 'disturbing', 'when', 'think', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'wanted', 'show', 'exactly', 'why', 'Erik', 'so', 'interested', 'Christine.The', 'twist', 'Erik', 'father', 'being', 'film', 'was', 'interesting', 'kind', 'disappointing', 'same', 'time.I', 'liked', 'chemistry', 'two', 'actors', 'could', 'tell', 'Erik', 'father', 'love', 'son.However', 'again', 'not', 'really', 'Phantom', 'plot', 'line', 'all.All', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'attempt', 'new', 'Phantom', 'film', 'time', 'one', 'thought', 'try', 'out', 'Susan', 'Kay', 'novel', 'Phantom', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'retelling.Very', 'nice.This', 'movie', 'good', 'not', 'really', 'favorite', 'list', 'more', 'good', 'romance', 'lovers', 'like', 'semi', 'sad', 'themes', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'well', 'developed.Either', 'way', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'good', 'attempt', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'multimedia', 'mix']",The Phantom of the Opera

Charles Dance as my namesake (yes I know he spells it with a k) is delightful.  Burt Lancaster as his father (Carriere) is well has the man ever done anything bad on the big or small screen?  It's a shame that this came out on DVD only and as 2 separate parts like on TV rather than one straight 3 hour film.  Must be because it never came on VHS.  In fact, after NBC showed it in 1990 it disappeared til A&E showed it a few times prior to the DVD release.  It is definitely a must see whether you have seen the musical, listened to the musical's soundtrack or none of the above.  If you are only fans of the silent movie, the Herbert Lom of the 60s, the Claude Rains of 43, or any of the others (yes even the Freddy Krueger one of 89) you are in for a surprise.

They were all just incredibly talented and moving in this production of Phantom that it leaves me speechless for words to describe just how extraordinary these actors all were in this touching version. This is indeed my favorite version aside from the original Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford one. Charles Dance was perfect as Phantom Erik and Teri Polo was just superb as Christine Daee. Burt Lancaster was absolutely moving as Erik's father and brought lots of warmth and sympathy to the role. The ending is a real tear-jerker when poor Erik is shot in this version and Christine truly loves Erik so much to the point where she removes his mask to look at him once more up close before he dies in his father's arms.

470704,A2CZBGIJP8TZ1T,630560939X,Joy,"[24, 27]","Words can't even describe how much I love this Phantom Of The Opera film! When my mother borrowed it from the library back in 2003, I was a bit skeptical to watch it because before watching this one, the only other one I saw which was in the 90's, was some horror version which I think was Dario Argento's version and it was so boring and the main storyline bored me. I hated it so I wasn't jumping for joy when I saw that my mom had borrowed this 1990 version. I know if I started with the Lon Chaney version, I would have been more excited because even though the Lon Chaney version isn't my favorite, it's a good film and I do like it but at least I've seen it since this 1990 one and that's all that matters. I then just decided and took a chance and watched it and man did I totally fall in love with it!! As a matter of fact, my mom had it for a couple of weeks and I saw it at least once a day until she had to return it. It became this daily thing and then right after she took it back, I ordered my own copy and have now seen it over 100 times and never get bored of it. This is the most romantic, passionate and emotional Phantom Of The Opera I've ever seen!!! Why, this is the most romantic, passionate and emotional movie I've ever seen!! I've seen many other versions since this and no other Phantom or any movie for that matter, could even hold a candle to this masterpiece!!!Charles Dance, who is now my favorite actor of all time because of this movie, is the best Phantom ever!! Forget Lon Chaney, which I've seen, forget Claude Rains who've I've also seen, forget Michael Crawford (who've I've heard from the cast recording and seen a whole bunch of videos of him from Phantom since 2003 which I know isn't a whole lot but just from what I've heard and seen, I still love Charles the most), Robert Englund and even Gerard Butler who've I've seen too because Charles Dance is the most romantic, passionate, sweetest Phantom ever and no one and I mean NO ONE could ever do a better job than Charles!!! Don't get me wrong, I like all the Phantoms I listed above, I'm just emphasizing how much I really love Charles!!! I didn't even know about Charles Dance until 2003 when I saw this magnificent film!!! The most romantic scene is between Erik and Christine who is played by Teri Polo (Meet The Parents/Fockers) on this picnic and I love everything he says and does and I can't stop watching that scene over and over again. I totally love the clothes he wore during that picnic scene and really impresses me! Why can't there be men out there today that dresses like that? There is also a couple really sad scenes with The Phantom/Charles which I won't give away but I start to cry every time I see them. If I didn't know better, I would say Charles Dance/The Phantom is really in love with Teri Polo/Christine because Charles makes it look like he really loves her especially this one sad part where he's crying that actually makes me cry too, he really makes me feel and see his pain. I just have totally fallin' in love with this movie and Charles Dance as an actor and it's because of this movie and of course Charles' sexy British accent which I totally love, that I've bought other Charles Dance movies that I never saw until I got them.The Phantom's father Gerard Carriere who is played by Burt Lancaster (Field Of Dreams) is really good also. Just last year, I found out that Burt Lancaster had passed away over 10 years ago from a heart attack and I still feel sad about it because he did a wonderful job as Erik's father and in other movies like Field Of Dreams and it's just so sad knowing that he's not even alive anymore! And in this film, Christines' love is not Raoul but Phillipe who is played by Adam Storke (The Stand). I will say this: If I were Christine, I would have picked Erik because Charles Dance makes him so romantic and passionate and even with the mask on, he is so handsome and the most important parts are his mouth and eyes so I would have definitely picked Charles Dance/The Phantom. Carlotta is very funny is this film also, especially in the Opera scenes, it's so hilarious!I love the music and the dialog and the singing and even though the singing parts were dubbed, it's amazing. Mich&egrave;le Lagrange, who did the singing for Christine/Teri Polo has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard.In this film, the following Operas/excerpts were featured:GOUNOD: FaustVERDI: La TraviataBELLINI: NormaThere is this one scene where Christine sings at the Bistro and the Opera piece that Christine sings is called ""Par le rang et par l'opulence"" from ""La Fille du Regiment"" (the daughter of the regiment) by DONIZETTI. Hearing these Operas have made me start really getting into Opera and has made me buy real Operas on CD and soon, will have all the Operas on CD that were featured in this film. The Operas sound incredible!But what really gets me every time in this film is Charles Dance's performance as The Phantom Of The Opera!! I am completely taken by Charles as an actor and there will never be a better Phantom than Charles!! Never!!!This Phantom film is my all time fav along with the 2004 one but if I had to choose between the two, it's so obvious which one I would ultimately pick: Charles Dance!!! If only I could find a man who dresses the way that Charles/The Phantom dressed during that picnic scene and was as romantic, I would be in heaven!!!One more thing: This film version actually was filmed in The Paris Opera House in France!And no one and I mean NO ONE could ever love Charles Dance/The Phantom or wish that they were Christine as much as I do!!! Never!!!",5,The MOST romantic film of all time!!!!,1127260800,"09 21, 2005",2005,5636,"['Words', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'describe', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'film', 'When', 'mother',

470706,A2NJO6YE954DBH,630560939X,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[64, 67]","This two-part televison version of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; is a mixed bag to be sure, but it does have its moments.  Clearly this is a post-Lloyd Webber version of &quot;Phantom,&quot; highlighting the romance between the title character (Charles Dance) and Christine (Terri Polo) even more than the Broadway show.  For once, the love triangle between teacher, pupil and Philippe (Adam Stroke), the Count de Chagny, is realistic; which is to say, Christine really has a choice between the two men who command her affection.  Of course, the paradox is that the more romantic a figure the Phantom becomes, the less he can be seen as a deadly maniac roaming at will through the Paris Opera House.  The result is that when this Phantom kills intruders into his subterranean realm, I found it hard to believe because it went against Erik's character (cf. the 1989 film version with Robert Englund of Freddy Krueger fame).One of the strengths of the film is the use it makes of the opera part of the title.  There is a wonderful scene early when Christine has come to the big city and has joined the chorus of the Opera.  One evening she is signing at a local tavern and the managers of the Opera House convince Carlotta (Andr&eacute;a Ferr&eacute;ol), the egotistical diva, to go up and sign with the girl.  However, it does not take long for Christine to blow Carlotta away, and when the diva flees from the stage we have clear proof as to who has more talent.  The finale of the mini-series involves a production of Charles Gounod's ""Faust,"" which is one of the best uses of an opera in a film since a production of ""La Traviata"" popped up in ""Pretty Woman.""  The choice of ""Faust"" is a masterstroke, not just because the opera is actually sung in French, but because there are some strong parallels between the story of Faust and that of the Phantom.  This allows for a rather surprising and haunting use of the opera's climatic aria.I know there will be strong disagreement on this score, but I also appreciated this version's approach to the Phantom's disfigurement.  There is a pivotal scene early on when Christine actually tries to persuade Erik to remove his mask, maintaining that she can look at whatever is beneath it with eyes of love.  When the mask is removed the focus is not on his face but rather on Christine's as she bases from shock to horror to senselessness.  It is that look, along with Erik's cry of anguish, that carries the scene.  More importantly, it sets up an even better scene at the end of the film.  That first scene is clearly influenced by the Broadway version, where the audience never sees the Phantom's face at that point, just Christine, rather than the immortal scene where Mary Philbin unmasked Lon Chaney in the classic silent version.  Meanwhile, the film's conclusion actually harkens back to Gaston Leroux's original novel with regards to how Christine conquers Erik.Editing this film down a bit would certainly be helpful; the four-hour mini-series loses about an hour once you take out the commercials, but could benefit from losing another half-hour or so.  The performances are competent, with Dance evincing charm as the Phantom without a real undercurrent of menace.  Polo is a tad too emotional at time and has a lot of lip-synching to do with all the opera singing, but there is an earnestness that matches the character.  Stroke has the unenviable tasks of trying to convince both Christine and the audience that she should pick his character instead of the Phantom.  Most of the supporting cast are assigned various roles of comic relief with French accents, while Burt Lancaster gets to bring some dignity to the proceedings as the former manager of the Paris Opera House who knows more about the Phantom than anyone knows.The key thing is that this 1990 version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is not going to be the first one you view.  You have to see Lon Chaney's silent version and at least listen to the Broadway musical (paying copious attention to the libretto so you know exactly what is happening).  The 1943 Claude Reins film involving acid being thrown and music being stolen is optional.  But the more you are familiar with the various tellings of this tale, the more you can enjoy what writer Arthur L.

The Phantom of the Opera's metamorphosis from an object of horror to a romantic hero can probably be credited to two extraordinary actors: Michael Crawford and Charles Dance. In this non-musical (unless you count that gorgeous duet from 'Faust') made-for-TV version, Dance's Erik has been reconfigured so that the beauty of his artist's soul encompasses his whole being, his disfigurement concealed behind a series of elegant masks. Tall and elegant, with a cat-like walk and a wry sense of humor, Dance does some of his most effective acting with his wonderfully expressive eyes. Moving effortlessly from swashbuckling action and urbane wit to heartbreaking vulnerability, his Erik is so magnetic that it seems incomprehensible that Terri Polo's brave and charming Christine would choose her childish, petulant boyfriend Raoul over him. Polo has some lovely and heartfelt scenes, especially her tearful farewell to Erik, and Burt Lancaster plays his father with a sad and gentle world-weariness that conveys his impending sense of doom.

Given that it was a made for TV miniseries and not a big screen motion picture with a massive budget, that's saying a lot.While it does have some irksome bits... namely the replacing of Raoul with his elder brother from the original novel, Phillipe, as Christine's love interest (no mention of Raoul is even made, poor guy), and the slightly corny ""picnic in the forest scene"" in the Phantom's layer... overall it is a wonderful telling of the story.The cast is masterful, and the musical score truely fitting.  The final scene on the roof of the opera house is especially noteworthy in it's depiction of sacrifice and emotion.  You won't go wrong with this DVD.  It portrays the Phantom as being very human at heart, and has some exceptionally touching moments.As far as the DVD itself, the only complaint I can make is about the lack of extras (in fact the only extra on the disc is a ""trailer"" that looks more like a soundtrack-less scene compilation than anything else).  But given that it was a TV miniseries that was made well before DVDs, I suppose it should come as no real surprise that there are no cast and crew interviews or gag reels.All in all, if you are a Phantom fan, buy this.

I'm such a HUGE fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage version, so I tend to always compare the two. But without the comparison, it's not that bad. I liked that we get a lot of background on Erik's (The Phantom) past. Charles Dance played a nice Phantom, his vocals sounded menacing, yet soothing at the same time. I didn't like that the part of Raoul, was changed to 'Phillipe' (but here I am comparing again). Teri Polo (now of 'Meet the Parents' fame) plays a nice Christine and it's heartbreaking when Carlotta drugs her and she's booed off the stage. At three hours or so, this really is an epic version of 'The Phantom'. There are some great images... when Christine and Phillipe (eye roll) take a midnight carriage ride or when The Phantom leads Christine through his lair. The set is so different. It's forest-like with stuffed birds/deer etc... all over the place. Creepy... It was nice to see Burt Lancaster and he did a good job. It was an interesting twist to have the former Opera manager actually be the Phantom's father. I agree with another viewer. Where's the Masquerade ball? That's one of the most stunning sequences in all of Broadway history and should have been included. The end is kind of unnecessary and plays out more like a suspense thriller with a chase on the Paris Opera rooftops. All in all, though, this is a decent version and has it's virtues.

Although it is highly inaccurate (comparing to Leroux's novel) concerning Erik's past before his life as the Phantom, it is the first Phantom movie I  have scene that chronicles Christine's past and her lifelong  relationship/friendship with her lover  with amazing faithfulness to the  novel.  Well, at least they do this up until she begins her life as an  employee at the Paris Opera house.  Oh, well.  Can't win them all.Also  wanted to add that La Carlotta and her husband are hysterically funny, as  is Erik a few times, in this movie.  Leroux's Erik has a sense of humor and  a beautiful singing voice, two charming qualities that had been continually  overlooked in the other movies.  (I know, the silent movie with Lon Chaney  discusses his lovely voice, but it's a silent movie...bummer.  He also  wasn't too funny in that one.  That one focuses almost solely on the  sinister.)I also like when Christine kisses a maskless Erik on the  forehead just like in the novel.

470714,A1IBDINRF8HZFR,630560939X,"The War Goddess ""Morrigahn""","[5, 10]","This movie is the best version of 'Phantom Of The Opera' that I have ever seen.  The music is wonderful, the cast is excellent, and the plot is very well done.Charles Dance gives an extrordinary performance as the Phantom and he plays the part so well that you can't help but love the character.The movie starts out with Christine Daee walking to the Opera House in hopes of finding a person to give her singing lessons.  As it turns out, she was sent by a wealthy count to see the manager and recieve singing lessons.The Manager, however, had been bought out by a different company.  The new manager does not listen to what the old manager has to say and dismisses the legends of an Opera Ghost as poppycock.  And that happens to be the first of his many mistakes.  His second one is ignoring what The Phantom says and the third is casting his wife, who can't sing, as the lead female.The Phantom then hears Christine sing and he offers to give her singing lessons.  She then is heard at The Bistro where the manager of the Opera House casts her in the lead role.This dosen't make his wife happy at all and therefore she sabatoges Christine's performance.The Phantom then rescues Christine and takes her to his realm under the Opera House where she'll be safe.  He treats her well, loves her, and then she asks him to let her see his face.He refuses and then she tells that she can love him regardless of what he looks like because she knows his heart and has seen his eyes.When he removes the mask, she faints and therefore he thinks she dosen't love him.  When she tries to escape, he catches her and then puts her in a cage thing, which she busts out of and then runs above ground where the Count and the old manager happpen to be standing in the lobby when Christine comes out of a secret door. The count then gets her out and takes her to his Chateau where she is put to bed.  but she recieves a dream where she sees the Phantom dying and she knows that she has to go back.  The count does not aggree with her plan but she is insistent and so she sings the part of Margurite in Faust and the Phantom hears her.  He comes to his box and sings the lead male role and the people love him.  After the performance, he jumps onto the stage, grabs Christine and takes her to the roof where there is climatic finish where the phantom winds up dying and Christine winds up with the count.",5,One Of The Greatest Love Stories Of All,1060128000,"08 6, 2003",2003,2385,"['movie', 'best', 'version', ""'Phantom"", 'Opera', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'music', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'excellent', 'plot', 'very', 'well', 'Dance', 'extrordinary', 'performance', 'Phantom', 'part', 'so', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'character.The', 'movie', 'out', 'Christine', 'Daee', 'walking', 'Opera', 'House', 'hopes', 'finding', 'person', 'give', 'singing', 'lessons', 'out', 'was', 'sent', 'wealthy', 'count', 'see', 'manager', 'recieve', 'singing', 'lessons.The', 'Manager', 'however', 'had', 'been', 'bought', 'out', 'different', 'company', 'new', 'manager', 'not', 'listen', 'what', 'old', 'manager', 'say', 'legends', 'Opera', 'Ghost', 'poppycock', 'be', 'first', 'many', 'mistakes', 'second', 'one', 'ignoring', 'what', 'Phantom', 'third', 'casting', 'wife', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'lead', 'female.The', 'Phantom', 'then', 'Christine', 'sing', 'give', 'singing', 'lessons', 'then', 'heard', 'Bistro', 'where', 'manager', 'Opera', 'House', 'lead', 'role.This', 'dose', ""n't"", 'make', 'wife', 'happy', 'therefore', 'Christine', 'performance.The', 'Phantom', 'then', 'Christine', 'realm', 'Opera', 'House', 'where', ""'ll"", 'be', 'safe', 'well', 'then', 'let', 'see', 'face.He', 'refuses', 'then', 'can', 'love', 'regardless', 'what', 'heart', 'seen', 'eyes.When', 'mask', 'faints', 'therefore', 'dose', ""n't"", 'love', 'When', 'escape', 'then', 'cage', 'thing', 'then', 'runs', 'ground', 'where', 'Count', 'old', 'manager', 'happpen', 'be', 'standing', 'lobby', 'when', 'Christine', 'secret', 'door', 'count', 'then', 'out', 'Chateau', 'where', 'put', 'bed', 'dream', 'where', 'Phantom', 'dying', 'go', 'back', 'count', 'not', 'aggree', 'plan', 'insistent', 'so', 'part', 'Margurite', 'Faust', 'Phantom', 'box', 'lead', 'male', 'role', 'people', 'love', 'performance', 'stage', 'grabs', 'Christine', 'roof', 'where', 'climatic', 'finish', 'where', 'phantom', 'up', 'dying', 'Christine', 'up', 'count']",The Phantom of the Opera

Sure there were some parts I didn't like but, for the most part it was good. The ending was way off but, I enjoyed it. Instead of Vicomte de Chagny there is now Count de Chagny and he goes by the name Phillipe (in the novel this is Raoul's brother). It explains how they met in their childhood and Phillipe is in some ways like the Phillipe in the novel. Instead of hearing an Angel of Music the Phantom offers singing lessons in person and tells her he wears the mask because he wants to be anonymous (which in my opinion is much more believable). Carlotta is married to the new manager and you kinda find out why Erik (the phantom) is deformed. Christine does fall in love with Erik and it seems happy until his unmasking. Unlike most movies where you see his face, you never see Erik's which in a way is fitting and left to your own imagination. I don't think they could make a face that would meet the expectations of many of the ""phans"". Also like the Susan Kay version it goes more into detail on why Erik becomes so obsessed with Christine. I am very picky with phantom stuff and liked this! So I highly suggest all ""phans"" see this version.",4,Very Creative and Interesting version of the Phantom,1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,1271,"['Even', 'mini-series', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'original', 'Leroux', 'novel', 'there', 'ever', 'been', 'one', 'similar', 'liked', 'Sure', 'were', 'parts', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'good', 'ending', 'was', 'way', 'enjoyed', 'Instead', 'Vicomte', 'de', 'Chagny', 'now', 'Count', 'de', 'Chagny', 'name', 'Phillipe', 'novel', 'Raoul', 'brother', 'how', 'met', 'childhood', 'Phillipe', 'ways', 'Phillipe', 'novel', 'Instead', 'hearing', 'Angel', 'Music', 'Phantom', 'singing', 'lessons', 'person', 'mask', 'be', 'anonymous', 'opinion', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'Carlotta', 'married', 'new', 'manager', 'kinda', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Erik', 'phantom', 'deformed', 'Christine', 'fall', 'love', 'Erik', 'happy', 'unmasking', 'most', 'movies', 'where', 'see', 'face', 'never', 'see', 'Erik', 'way', 'fitting', 'left', 'own', 'imagination', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'make', 'face', 'would', 'meet', 'expectations', 'many', 'phans', 'Also', 'Susan', 'Kay', 'version', 'more', 'detail', 'why', 'Erik', 'so', 'obsessed', 'Christine', 'am', 'very', 'picky', 'phantom', 'stuff', 'liked', 'So', 'highly', 'suggest', 'phans', 'see', 'version']",The Phantom of the Opera
