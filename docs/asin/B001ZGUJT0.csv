Also the scene with the three teenagers (two female, one male) speaking about how large they are/like it to be is rather...well the acting is so bad it really should have been left out.  The first half of the movie is rather slow considering it shows one sexual encounter after another until the two main characters meet.The movie does show some interesting techniques to ummm deal with the main characters' issues but aside from a few of those we found rather funny (and I am not sure they were ment to be funny) that was pretty much all we got out of it.  So we gave it one star for the humor and the other star was for the view from her vagina.  That was indeed a first for us.We watched it and it wasn't something we enjoyed enough to watch again.

It is a completely insane plot and the production values are not exactly sky-high.The director is known for creating cult, over the top movies, and he doesn't disappoint here.  The opening scene is the female lead explaining to us how she was born with 7 (at least) clits.  It moves forward from there.  I just couldn't stop watching.  It was so insane that we had to see what would happen next.  Also, if you are a dude, you will enjoy the plethora of boobs sprinkled liberally throughout the experience.This is a good one to rent if you are in the mood for something different.

The fact that they accidentally set fire to the 150-year-old mansion they rented for a whopping $4,000 as the film's primary location -- and then extinguished the flame with diet soda -- gives you some clue that this was not a normal shoot!And then there are the purple-hued ""penis-cam"" shots...Suffice it to say that if you enjoy ""Something Weird"" videos, you will likely enjoy this film, which also features one of the most tragic ""happy endings"" you will ever see.As the director says on the commentary, at the consummation of this unusual love story, ""Now there's something you don't see every day.""

There's quite a lot of nudity as we see about half a dozen different women being attacked - albeit very very briefly and not very explicitly.Jennifer kills a couple of her lovers for no real reason either.

1245783,A2GHCZWQMAR1A7,B001ZGUJT0,"Mark S. Williams ""Mark Williams""","[3, 9]","I anxiously awaited the release of Frank Henenlotter's new opus BAD BIOLOGY.  After all, his BASKET CASE, BRAIN DAMAGE, and FRANKENHOOKER are master works and three of the funniest movies ever.  They are films that work on several levels.  Entertaining from start to finish, they're imaginative, extremely well written, edgy, and have underlying, serious themes explored intelligently.  BASKET CASE examines alienation in society and within families.  BRAIN DAMAGE is a hard look at the horrors of drug addiction.  FRANKENHOOKER touches on losing a loved one early in life.I even love the liner notes Mr. Henenlotter wrote for his Special Edition series released on Something Weird Video.  It's obvious as well that he's probably one of the nicest guys in show business.BAD BIOLOGY, like the others, is professionally-made on a small budget.  However, its content is thoroughly ugly and unfunny.  There's no compassion shown for the leads, and no wit to speak of.  The best moments are but brief and pale imitations of the earlier movies.  Even the climax is dull viewing.  I'm inclined to place all the blame for this confused mess on producer and co-writer R.A. Thorburn.  His god-awful rap-video, included on the dvd, has him throwing gallons of his fecal matter on a lovely nude woman.  That he thinks it's entertaining is depraved.  It doesn't even have shock value.  It just disgusts, and mostly conveys he has no musical sensibility whatsoever.I suppose I'm predjudiced because I didn't like Mr. Thorburn much the first time I saw him, revisiting locations with Mr. Henenlotter on the Special Edition of BASKET CASE.I imagine the movie couldn't have been made without Thorburn's financial contribution.

1245784,A2HSFKLLQHYY6S,B001ZGUJT0,Matt Skidmore,"[3, 7]","When a movie begins with the not so subtle opening credit of ''An R.A. The Rugged Man Thorburn production' you get the impression that you're not entering into the next great cinematic masterpiece. However, when that is followed by 'A Film by Frank Henenlotter' your hopes are raised considerably higher. However, from my recent viewing of Mr Henenlotter's latest endeavor, maybe I shouldn't have raised my hopes that high at all...Henelotter has been away from directing movies for a very long time and for me at least, he's been sorely missed. His unique brand of bizarre ideas combined with an actual 'idea' behind them proved a very successful antidote to all those 80s slashers that he was so obviously trying to distance himself away from. Beginning with the great 'Basket Case 1 & 2' to my favourite anti-drugs movie 'Bran Damage' and finally with the near classic 'Frankenhooker', old Uncle Frank has entertained me time and time again with his off the wall humor and strange creature features. So, to see him 'come home' has been an exciting proposition to say the least...Which brings us to 'Bad Biology'. The story has Jennifer, a young woman with a strange abnormal mutation (which we couldn't possibly discuss on a family website) which gives her a heightened lust for sexual gratification. Across town, a young man named Bax, who has his own sexual issues (again, which I won't spoil here) injects steroids into his . . . err . . . gentleman jim to satisfy his own particular frustrations. The first half of the movie splices scenes of these two sexual adventurers in their many encounters with hapless horny folk up until their long awaited meeting when . . . well, let's say sparks do indeed fly between the two.This eventual meeting is possibly the problem with the movie. The preceeding 50 minutes or so is just a collection of soft core sex scenes combined with awful acting from a plethora of rap stars and adult actresses and you yearn for the main couple to meet. The lead up to their union is quite dull and you find yourself wanting to forward to the end... Lead Charlee Danielson isn't the best actor in the world and when she breaks the 'fourth wall' by talking to the audience about her lustful activities - it comes across as amateur and mis-directed (instead of amusing and fresh, which it was so obviously trying to be). Anthony Sneed doesn't fair much better either, yet he does represent the usual Henenlotter lead actor role with the ''boy with a secret'' scenario that is prevalent in many of Frank's back history of films. To be fair, the acting across the board is pretty painful and one particular scene which takes place in a diner where 3 teens talk candidly about their private life is so badly acted and staged that it resembles a school play or indeed a rehearsal for the final scene.The film plods along at a slow pace with the odd shot of female flesh every 3 minutes, and even this usually helpful cinematic device becomes tiresome at the 40 minute mark. Your mind starts to wish old Aylmer or Belial would turn up and give this movie some life . . . or at least, a little personality. Things that are obviously shocking or subversive in the film makers minds just come across as cheap, sleazy and tacky in actuality and the wonderfully dull script by both Henenlotter and Rugged Man is both school boy smirk and tired horror comedy in one - and not something of originality and wit that I feel Henenlotter was always remembered for.On one hand, I admire his dedication to keeping things low budget and not just directing the usual horror sequel dreck - but, when you compare this to his older catalogue - it seems the director is far from the top of his game.This review, taken from the UK Region 2 release (I am assuming there maybe extras on the Region 1 release) - the disc is a movie only affair, yet the picture is sharp and the movie does look good on what is obviously a low budget. The audio is a little all over the place, but that's a minor quibble. The film itself isn't the comeback I was hoping for and just in another long line of crude and smutty horror comedies that clog up video store shelves.

1245786,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B001ZGUJT0,Michael R Gates,"[4, 8]","The horror films of director Frank Henenlotter are always narratively outrageous and visually over-the-top, so when moviegoers familiar with his approach to horror stories and his cinematic style see the name HENENLOTTER on a project, they expect to get an eyeful and an earful.  But with his earlier films like BASKET CASE (1982), BRAIN DAMAGE (1988), and FRANKENHOOKER (1990), the writer/director delivers more than bizarre story lines and over-the-top gore and FX.  While outrageously fun in a grindhouse kind of way, each of these films also has a subtext that offers a culturally relevant, highly satirical commentary on Western society and human foibles.  However, after watching BAD BIOLOGY--the director's long-awaited return to the movie biz--fans of Henenlotter's other films will be left scratching their heads and wondering WTF?Like Henenlotter's FRANKENHOOKER, the writer-director's BAD BIOLOGY tackles the themes of human sexuality and Western sexual mores.  The problem, though, is that the once witty and iconoclastic filmmaker doesn't seem to have anything left to say about such topics.  His story revolves around a girl who was born with a vaginal mutation that makes it impossible for her to be satisfied by any normal man or woman, and in her quest to rectify her problem, she stumbles across a boy who, because of his own genital deformity, just might be able to satiate her every need and desire.  Unfortunately for her, the boy hasn't emotionally adjusted to his biological defect as well as she has to her own, and because of his reluctance to let nature take its course, his (ahem!) manhood has decided to take matters into its own ""hands.""  Clearly, the film's plot is paper thin and somewhat cliched, but it could be a vehicle for biting satire in the hands of a master like Henenlotter. Sadly, however, the filmmaker's usual sarcastic and curmudgeonly sense of humor is almost totally absent.  Instead of delivering wry observations about the absurdity of human behavior and the hypocrisy of Western social practices and traditions, BAD BIOLOGY offers little more than copious T&A; shots and a little (very) soft-core porn action.  Even the film's bizarre climax (excuse the pun) seems to be nothing more than an excuse for Henenlotter to be inordinately blasphemous while delivering a couple of bad (as in NOT FUNNY) sight gags about male genitalia.Shriek Show's DVD edition of an unrated version of BAD BIOLOGY offers the film in its intended aspect ratio of 1.78:1 (not the 1.33:1 ratio indicated in some reports), and the transfer from 35mm film to digital is stunning.  This is a real plus, especially considering that the cinematography is one of the best things about the film.  The sound quality, however, is another story.  Audio is offered in both 2.0 and 5.1 Dolby Surround, but in both mixes, dialogue is often muffled by the ambient sound and FX, especially when a scene is set in a public place such as a nightclub.  DVD extras include some behind-the-scenes footage, a Henenlotter-directed video from R.A. The Rugged Man (a rap singer who produced the film and contributed to the soundtrack), and a feature commentary with the director and the producer.Warning: There is a bug in the DVD's menu system that causes the disc to stall when it is loading on a blu-ray player.  Fortunately, users can get around this by hitting the player's MENU button, which then opens the disk's root menu.  As far as could be determined through testing, this bug only seems to manifest itself on blu-ray players and does not seem to occur when the disk is played in a standard DVD player.In short, BAD BIOLOGY is an unsatisfying horror film, especially for fans of Henenlotter who are hoping, after a long wait, for another one of the legendary filmmaker's over-the-top but meaningful satires.  If T&A;, bad sex jokes, and groan-generating sight gags about genitalia are all you're after, this might be the film for you.  Otherwise, you'll just have to keep waiting to see if Henenlotter makes a true comeback.",2,"Bad Biology?

We get about five minutes of entirely unintelligible street patois, and then we cut to a scene of a man berating a woman because he can't understand what she's saying. It's that sort of thoughtfulness that makes me wonder why Henenlotter didn't spend another sixteen years revising the script.I love the premise of this movie: two people who, shall we say, get overexcited when they're making love (this inevitably results in the deaths of their partners) are living in the same city, but are unaware of one another's existence until a chance meeting. It's obvious they're made for one another, but they've both had such terrible experiences before that they're shy around one another and afraid to reach out. It's a great idea. Unfortunately, the execution is a little off. In fact, aside from the idea, there's not a single thing about this movie that makes me want to recommend it. The acting is competent at best (and isn't usually as its best), the direction is lackluster, the soundtrack is far more horrifying than the special effects, which are at least amusing at times, in that sort of toilet-humor way we're not supposed to find amusing after fifth grade, but is a guilty pleasure for almost everyone I know.If you find yourself watching this, don't think about what is.

It's a welcome return and he certainly hasn't grown up, which is good.  In recent years he has teamed up with a rap artist called RA The Rugged Man.  RA did the music for this film and co-wrote it as well, which probably accounts for the large number of white rapper types in the film.Bad Biology is billed as a ""God-Awful Love Story"", but to me it's not much of a love story at all, god-awful or not.  The two leads don't actually meet until the end of the film, and it's not even the least bit romantic.The two central characters are a man and woman who each have enhanced and/or added sexual equipment.  In Henenlotter's world this translates to mutated and deformed!  This causes problems for their sex partners/victims who seem to suffer from coming in contact with them.The two leads are more or less made for one another to engage sexually.  Like I said though, their meeting isn't until the last act and it doesn't run as smoothly planned.This isn't Henenlotter's best I must say, but that also means it's much better than a lot of stuff out there that tries for the old grindhouse vibe.  It's as sexually crude as possible without becoming pornographic, so don't watch it with the kiddies.  That may be one of the problems too is that it's more or less a nonstop sexathon when a bit more story could have been focused on.  Henenlotter's films, while outrageous, were always a step ahead because of good characters and story.  Nobody here is all that interesting to be honest.  Also, the stop motion animated disembodied penis with a sinister mind of it's own was done before in the Russ Meyer tribute film, Pervert!But even with that being said, it's still pretty entertaining and occasionally quite funny.  In this crappy age of digital, Henenlotter gives us the added treat of shooting in 35mm!Bad Biology is a welcome return, and hopefully Henenlotter is back to stay for awhile this time.",4,"Finally, A Woman With That Little Extra ""Something""",1339200000,"06 9, 2012",2012,2007,"['more', 'less', 'retiring', 'early', '90s', 'Basket', 'Case', '3', 'Frank', 'Henenlotter', 'back', 'game', 'welcome', 'return', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'grown', 'up', 'good', 'recent', 'years', 'teamed', 'up', 'rap', 'artist', 'called', 'RA', 'Rugged', 'Man', 'RA', 'did', 'music', 'film', 'co-wrote', 'well', 'probably', 'accounts', 'large', 'number', 'white', 'rapper', 'types', 'film.Bad', 'Biology', 'billed', 'God-Awful', 'Love', 'Story', 'not', 'much', 'love', 'story', 'god-awful', 'not', 'two', 'leads', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'meet', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'least', 'bit', 'romantic.The', 'two', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'man', 'woman', 'who', 'have', 'enhanced', 'and/or', 'added', 'sexual', 'equipment', 'Henenlotter', 'world', 'mutated', 'deformed', 'problems', 'sex', 'partners/victims', 'who', 'seem', 'suffer', 'coming', 'contact', 'them.The', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'made', 'one', 'engage', 'sexually', 'said', 'meeting', ""n't"", 'last', 'act', ""n't"", 'run', 'smoothly', 'planned.This', ""n't"", 'Henenlotter', 'best', 'must', 'say', 'also', 'much', 'better', 'lot', 'stuff', 'there', 'tries', 'old', 'grindhouse', 'vibe', 'sexually', 'crude', 'possible', 'becoming', 'pornographic', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'kiddies', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'problems', 'too', 'more', 'less', 'nonstop', 'sexathon', 'when', 'bit', 'more', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'focused', 'Henenlotter', 'films', 'outrageous', 'were', 'always', 'step', 'ahead', 'good', 'characters', 'story', 'Nobody', 'here', 'interesting', 'be', 'honest', 'Also', 'stop', 'motion', 'animated', 'disembodied', 'penis', 'sinister', 'mind', 'own', 'was', 'done', 'before', 'Russ', 'Meyer', 'tribute', 'film', 'Pervert', 'even', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'occasionally', 'quite', 'funny', 'crappy', 'age', 'digital', 'Henenlotter', 'added', 'treat', 'shooting', '35mm', 'Bad', 'Biology', 'welcome', 'return', 'hopefully', 'Henenlotter', 'back', 'stay', 'awhile', 'time']",Bad Biology [Region 2]
