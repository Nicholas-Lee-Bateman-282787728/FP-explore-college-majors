I wound up thoroughly enjoying it.First, I should probably say why I initially resisted it... 1) The whole concept was unappealing. 2) A long-time fan of Aardman, I had been disappointed by ""W&G; and the Curse of the Were-Rabbit"". 3) I knew that this was done with CGI in the style of claymation and that kinda turned me off.The concept proved much more appealing in its entirety than was evident in the trailers. The plot is serviceable, the casting and the voice talent are uniformly excellent. The plot is certainly better, and better executed, than ""Were-Rabbit"". The animation was top notch. To be sure it was highly stylized CGI to emulate claymation, but it worked brilliantly.Certainly, the characters are more believable and sympathetic than in ""Were-Rabbit"".

1043271,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000M343BC,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 17]","""Flushed Away"" is a film I'm torn over. On the one hand, it's perfect for children, filled with humorous circumstances, borderline slapstick action sequences, and colorful characters. On the other hand, it's unflatteringly unoriginal, despite the unique settings and vibrant plot. It didn't help that I had already seen most of the funnier moments in the trailers and TV commercials, all of which were repeatedly played. They felt hollow by the time I actually saw the film, with all my initial amusement completely run dry. I'm beginning to think that too many animated films were released in 2006. But such a thought is wasted effort; more will be released before the year is over, and I know I'm going to see at least one or two of them. Call me crazy, but even though I'm an adult, I still have a soft spot for family oriented animated films.And that's why criticizing this film will be difficult. I recognize that it has its good points, and it comes across in the plot; it tells the story of a pampered pet rat named Roddy (Hugh Jackman). While he lives the good life in an upper class British neighborhood called Kensington, he's incredibly lonely, having only his young owner's dolls to serve as friends. He even says ""Goodnight"" to himself when he goes to bed. But such a humdrum life is about to change; one night, a rat pops out of the kitchen sink. Here enters Sid (Shane Richie), a loud, obnoxious sewer rat who decides that he wants the kind of life Roddy has. In desperation, Roddy attempts to flush his unwanted guest down the toilet. Unfortunately, it backfires; Roddy is the one who lands in the bowl, and Sid is quick to pull the flushing mechanism.Thus begins Roddy's adventure in the sewers of London, one that will force him to reassess his life on the surface. In this underworld, he discovers an entire population of rats, all of which live in an elaborately modeled miniature city. He also discovers other life forms, specifically frogs and slugs. I admit that such an idea was promising, and to some degree, it succeeded. Consider the interesting characters he runs into; the most important is Rita (Kate Winslet), an on-the-run, tough-as-nails rat who pilots a makeshift watercraft. Apparently, a ruthless amphibian crime boss known only as The Frog (Ian McKellen) wants a ruby that's in her possession (why he wants it is never adequately explained), and he's prepared to go to great lengths to get it.But matters are complicated when Roddy enters the picture. Initially, his only goal is to get back home; never mind Rita, the ruby, The Frog, or The Frog's dimwitted henchman, Whitey (Bill Nighy) and Spike (Andy Serkis). But through a series of ill-timed and accidental events (such as revealing Rita's location and destroying a number of The Frog's best loved souvenirs), Roddy gets himself involved. He now has to work with Rita if he wishes to return home, no easy task considering Rita's distrusting nature. The fact that she steals a computer power cord from The Frog's lair makes the situation even worse; The Frog needs that cord in order to carry out a dastardly plan during the World Series, one that directly relates to his hatred of rodents.It seems as if I'm describing a completely engaging film. But the reality is that something was missing. Let's start with the underground city: it's impressive to say the least. In retrospect, it's a little too impressive; the local rats have built a near-perfect replica of London, complete with a working London Bridge and a menacing yet attractive Big Ben. Access to electricity doesn't seem to be a problem, and this is proven through shots of the city's miniature neon light displays. If such a fantastic world has been created, one would expect it to be central to the story, relevant enough to warrant serious exploration. This didn't happen in ""Flushed Away""; the best we're given are some brief exterior shots, all of which do little to make the rest of the story meaningful. Example: have the rats created little supermarkets in this city, and if so, do they shop in them? Such a slice of life would have given this film a much-needed dose of credibility.Rita's circumstances were also problematic; it's eventually revealed that she has a large family living in poverty (in the sewer world, that translates to a floating pile of boxes that continuously rocks back and forth). Her intention in stealing the ruby was selfless rather than selfish; her family needs money desperately. This goes double for her father, whose entire body is wrapped in a cast (much like before, no adequate explanation is given for this). Yes, Rita's plight is touching, but it still didn't make enough of an impact. Her family is given such little screen time that its general inclusion in the story seemed unnecessary (save for a few amusing one liners). Maybe it would have been better if Rita had stolen the ruby for selfish reasons; it may lack any morality, but at least the story would be more focused.And then there are the side characters, most of which are provided for comedy relief. A legion of slugs is first and foremost in this film. At times they act like frightened children, screaming in weak, squeaky voices at anything unfamiliar (specifically Roddy). At other times, they serve the story as a kind of Greek Chorus, appearing at inconvenient moments to express the characters' feelings through song (most of which are recent pop hits; ""Rolling on the River"" and ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" come to mind). The idea initially worked. But after a while, their continuous presence became repetitive and stale. Then there's Le Frog (Jean Reno), The Frog's perpetually sticky, ninja-fighting French cousin. He's nothing more than a caricature, hollowly portraying a nationality in exaggerated, almost offensive ways. ""I laugh at everyone's pain but my own,"" he says: ""I'm French!""I realize that I may be analyzing ""Flushed Away"" a little too deeply. The fact that it forced an analysis in the first place is troublesome. Am I not supposed to escape into this fantasy world? Wasn't I supposed to lose myself in imagination and fun? I wish I could say that this film had that kind of effect on me, and I wish that it had enough good points to outweigh its flaws. Sadly, this isn't the case; I can only consider ""Flushed Away"" as a decent attempt that ultimately misses the mark.

1043274,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000M343BC,"Cloud ""...""","[7, 10]","It's a bad sign when, after watching the film, the only thing really worth remembering was slugs. Yes, for all its technical marvel and impressive cast list, the only thing that really entertained me were singing slugs. It's hard to figure out where the problem was but it's just something that nagged throughout the whole thing: this should be making me laugh and it's only doing it in parts and even then, the humor didn't even look part of the intended joke. It's not really a terrible film but it's hard to wholeheartedly recommend and refrain from suggesting a better film instead.Roddy is a pampered rat living in a posh house in England. He plays and daydreams but he's by himself, which he's aware of constantly. One day, a couch potato/slob of a rat comes out of the sink and flushes Roddy down the toilet. A fish out of water among the sewer folk, he runs into Rita, a street-wise rat who's in trouble with the local frog mob boss. Roddy reluctantly teams up with Rita and eventually have to stop the frog's scheme and become friends and potentially something more.The humor of the film feels like a mix between British humor and American humor as seen through a Britishman's eyes. Even though we're a little sick of fart, burp and hit-in-the-crotch jokes, apparently they don't think so and we got tons. Some will laugh a lot and find the film charming while others will probably barely laugh. Another knock, although it's not as bad as Dreamworks' stuff, is the cast list. Hugh ""Wolverine"" Jackman plays Roddy and while he does an admirable job, you can tell the voice acting stuff is new to him and he gets overshadowed by everyone else, along with Kate Winslet. Highlights though are Bill Nighy and Andy Serkis as henchmen and Jean Reno as a french bad guy.The look of the film though works as well although it seems odd at times. The basic premise is claymation-looking characters but animated in the computer. So while everything was done in the computer, the characters look as if they were done in the Aardman-style of stop motion animation like Wallace and Gromit. On one hand, it gives the film a unique look while on the other, having thumbprints on the clay or mouth movements looking noticeably choppy feels distracting. Either go fully 3D worlds and characters or make the world look as if it was stop-motion animated as well. But the way it is just feels clunky.Is it watchable and something to recommend? Maybe. You wouldn't think an animated film will have a ""love it or hate it"" vibe but that's what I get here. I don't hate it but this is far below what was expected.",3,"Kinda funny, kinda slow",1175385600,"04 1, 2007",2007,2596,"['bad', 'sign', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'worth', 'remembering', 'was', 'slugs', 'Yes', 'technical', 'marvel', 'impressive', 'cast', 'list', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'entertained', 'were', 'singing', 'slugs', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'problem', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'nagged', 'whole', 'thing', 'should', 'be', 'making', 'only', 'doing', 'parts', 'even', 'then', 'humor', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'part', 'intended', 'joke', 'not', 'really', 'terrible', 'film', 'hard', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'refrain', 'suggesting', 'better', 'film', 'instead.Roddy', 'pampered', 'rat', 'living', 'posh', 'house', 'England', 'daydreams', 'aware', 'constantly', 'One', 'day', 'couch', 'potato/slob', 'rat', 'sink', 'flushes', 'Roddy', 'toilet', 'fish', 'water', 'sewer', 'folk', 'Rita', 'street-wise', 'rat', 'who', 'trouble', 'local', 'frog', 'mob', 'boss', 'Roddy', 'reluctantly', 'up', 'Rita', 'eventually', 'have', 'stop', 'frog', 'scheme', 'become', 'friends', 'potentially', 'something', 'more.The', 'humor', 'film', 'feels', 'mix', 'British', 'humor', 'American', 'humor', 'seen', 'Britishman', 'eyes', 'Even', ""'re"", 'little', 'sick', 'fart', 'burp', 'hit-in-the-crotch', 'jokes', 'apparently', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'got', 'tons', 'will', 'laugh', 'lot', 'find', 'film', 'charming', 'others', 'will', 'probably', 'barely', 'laugh', 'knock', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'Dreamworks', 'stuff', 'cast', 'list', 'Wolverine', 'Jackman', 'Roddy', 'admirable', 'job', 'can', 'tell', 'voice', 'acting', 'stuff', 'new', 'overshadowed', 'everyone', 'else', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Highlights', 'are', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'henchmen', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'french', 'bad', 'guy.The', 'look', 'film', 'though', 'as', 'well', 'odd', 'times', 'basic', 'premise', 'claymation-looking', 'characters', 'animated', 'computer', 'So', 'everything', 'was', 'done', 'computer', 'characters', 'look', 'were', 'done', 'Aardman-style', 'stop', 'motion', 'animation', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'one', 'hand', 'film', 'unique', 'look', 'other', 'having', 'thumbprints', 'clay', 'mouth', 'movements', 'looking', 'noticeably', 'choppy', 'feels', 'distracting', 'go', 'fully', '3D', 'worlds', 'characters', 'make', 'world', 'look', 'was', 'stop-motion', 'animated', 'well', 'way', 'just', 'feels', 'clunky.Is', 'watchable', 'something', 'recommend', 'Maybe', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'animated', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'love', 'hate', 'vibe', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'far', 'what', 'was', 'expected']",Flushed Away

His quest becomes to get back home, but along the way, he figures a few things out, and what matters the most to him.I must say, hugh jackman as roddy, kate winslet as rita, and Ian Mckellen as the toad work quite well, great voices that fit the parts well.

1043277,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000M343BC,Craig Matteson,"[5, 5]","This is a delightful movie.  The visuals are a top notch, but the characterizations are even better.  Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet play the romantic leads as Roddy and Rita.  He is a upper crust pet rat from Kensington (a suburb within London) and Rita comes from down down down in the sewers.  The rats down there seem to have built their city.They meet because Roddy's family (owners) leave for a vacation.  Roddy entertains himself as best he can when out of the pipes comes Sid (Shane Ritchie) who clearly comes from somewhere less refined.  Sid announces he is taking over and Roddy's plan to get rid of Sid backfires and Roddy ends up flushed into the sewers.  Roddy tries to get some help to get back to Kensington, which leads him to Rita.  She has real troubles of her own and Roddy's troubles multiply.Ian McKellen plays Toad, the big boss of this underworld.  He wants something that he claims Rita took, and has some secret plan that I won't get into here.  His main two henchmen are Whitey (the large one - played by Bill Nighy who played Davey Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean 2) and Spike (the small one - played by Andy Sirkis who played Gollum in Lord of the Rings and King Kong).  These two have some great lines together.Toad also enlists the help of Le Frog (Jean Reno - who has played so many wonderful roles) and his own band of henchfrogs.  And being French they have many lines related to those quirks.  For example, Le Frog says, ""We now have a mission!  Let nothing stand in our way!  We leave immediately!""  One of the henchfrongs asks, ""What about dinner?"".  Silence.  Then Le Frog says, ""We leave in five hours!!""I am sure there has never been a movie that has used slugs so extensively and to such good effect.  They form a kind of chorus that supplies some of the movie's incidental music, its ambient music, some commentary on the scenes and even draw on our sympathy when they seem threatened.

It was funny and entertaining, and I never got bored or irritated with it. Even my teenager laughed, and he's a hard sell.Roddy (Hugh Jackman) is a pet rat with a posh life--a gilded cage, and when the humans are away, he can do as he pleases, with the dolls from the dollhouse for companionship. Then one day, the house is invaded by a sewer rat named Sid, and when Roddy tries to lure him into the ""jacuzzi,"" Roddy's the one who gets flushed instead.He ends up in and underground rat city that's busy and full of cute details I had to pause to check out on DVD because there was no way I could catch all of them--things like a teacup ride made from actual teacups, what looked like Lego flowers, and hand-mixer jet skis. It reminded me very much of the Borrowers or the Littles books from when I was a kid.All Roddy wants is to get home, and in his quest, he gets help from Rita (Kate Winslet)--as long as he promises to pay her, that is--and runs afoul of The Toad. The various characters are a hoot--from the singing slugs to the French ninja frogs, led by LeFrog (Jean Reno), who not only fight, but bring along their own mime.Roddy's character arc is predictable, but at least he has one, and he and Rita have interesting and distinct personalities.One thing we all found amusing was that the rats were all into the World Cup, and especially the reaction of the American rat--after living through World Cup fever here in Germany a couple of summers ago.It's not The World's Greatest Animated Comedy, but it's well worth your time.",4,fun and entertaining,1227657600,"11 26, 2008",2008,1643,"['must', 'admit', 'afterBarnyard', 'was', 'bit', 'leery', 'seeing', 'animated', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'was', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'never', 'got', 'bored', 'irritated', 'Even', 'teenager', 'laughed', 'hard', 'sell.Roddy', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'pet', 'rat', 'posh', 'life', 'gilded', 'cage', 'when', 'humans', 'are', 'away', 'can', 'do', 'dolls', 'dollhouse', 'companionship', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'house', 'invaded', 'sewer', 'rat', 'named', 'Sid', 'when', 'Roddy', 'lure', 'jacuzzi', 'Roddy', 'one', 'who', 'flushed', 'instead.He', 'up', 'underground', 'rat', 'city', 'busy', 'full', 'cute', 'details', 'had', 'pause', 'check', 'out', 'DVD', 'was', 'way', 'could', 'catch', 'things', 'teacup', 'ride', 'made', 'actual', 'teacups', 'what', 'looked', 'like', 'Lego', 'flowers', 'hand-mixer', 'jet', 'skis', 'reminded', 'very', 'much', 'Borrowers', 'Littles', 'books', 'when', 'was', 'kid.All', 'Roddy', 'get', 'home', 'quest', 'help', 'Rita', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'as', 'long', 'pay', 'afoul', 'Toad', 'various', 'characters', 'are', 'hoot', 'singing', 'slugs', 'French', 'ninja', 'frogs', 'led', 'LeFrog', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'fight', 'bring', 'along', 'own', 'mime.Roddy', 'character', 'arc', 'predictable', 'least', 'one', 'Rita', 'have', 'interesting', 'distinct', 'personalities.One', 'thing', 'found', 'amusing', 'was', 'rats', 'were', 'World', 'Cup', 'especially', 'reaction', 'American', 'rat', 'living', 'World', 'Cup', 'fever', 'here', 'Germany', 'couple', 'summers', 'ago.It', 'not', 'World', 'Greatest', 'Animated', 'Comedy', 'well', 'time']",Flushed Away

I saw that it was an animation and quickly glanced at the slapstick silliness of it and said, ""Eh, not now"". Months later a friend gave me this movie in a pile of films to borrow. Yet still, I saved this movie as one of the last to watch. Its so funny how one can misperceive and so quickly brush off a film based on a few glimpses of it. I surely did this, later finding out this is one of the most exciting animation films I have seen in along time. Aardman Animation and Dreamworks team up for an endearing and entertaining storyline.  Aardman has brought us the clay/stop-motion animation of Wallace and Gromit. In Flushed Away, one can see the influences the medium of clay have on this film. At times the film is clearly CGI, other times clay-like.As for the characters, we have some wonderful ones in this film. The main characters and their personalities are so well-developed, however it is the little characters in the film that make this film feel whole...you will love the slugs and the ninja frogs. In Flushed Away, the writer does what all good animation or fantasy does; creates a world existing in our world, but is hidden. Roddy St. James, the main character in the film, is a pet mouse completely unaware that there is an entire mouse/rat city a toilet flush away. So much fun. Sure to please children and adults.

Thus Rodney's social interactions are limited to his owner's dolls when she is not around.  After the girl and her family leave for a week-long trip he spends the first day humorously if somewhat poignantly partying with the dolls until his somewhat lonely if well-ordered interlude is shattered by the arrival of a coarse, unrefined, and too tough to beat up sewer rat, Sid (Shane Richie), who takes one look at Roddy's posh Kensington pad and announces that he is staying.  Roddy's desperate attempt to get rid of Sid by convincing him that the toilet is a Jacuzzi backfires (because Sid is not quite THAT stupid) so that it is Roddy who getsFlushed Away.What he discovers to his (and the audience's) surprise is a miniature sewer rat version of London built from discarded materials and chock full of wonder and sight gags, but Roddy has eyes for none of it as he is desperate to find a way to get back home to deal with Sid before his owner returns.  Inquiries lead him to the salvage boat (also built of salvage, naturally) Jammy Dodger, captained by the tough and working class Rita (Kate Winslet) who is struggling to support her large family and being hunted by The Toad (Ian McKellen), the malevolent amphibious kingpin of the local rat Mob, because she has something he wants.  Roddy's attempt to ingratiate himself with the Toad by giving him what he wants backfires when the same clumsiness that gave him the opportunity causes him to destroy the Toad's ""priceless"" collection of Royal Family memorabilia.  Sentenced to being ""iced"" (literally), Rita and Roddy are forced to flee together, unknowingly taking something the Toad wants back even more than the first item, leading the Toad's hench-rats a merry chase through the sewers of London, and finally forcing the overly theatrical Toad to call in his dreaded mercenary cousin, Le Frog (Jean Reno), to finish the job and restore to him the Key to his Sinister Plot.Unfortunately this capsule synopsis cannot do justice to this joke-a-minute joy, which includes clever and sprightly dialogue, sight gags galore, hysterically self-parodying voice acting by McKellen and Reno in particular, a running gag involving a Greek Chorus of singing slugs, out-of-nowhere references to everything fromFinding Nemoto the oldBatmanTV series, the best mime bit I've ever seen, the best waterborne movie chase sinceLive and Let Die, a never ending series of French jokes, and even Hugh Jackman's excuse for a singing voice.Defects?  Well, there might be a few too many belching, farting, and injury to crotch jokes for some (though at least in this movie they are FUNNY), and, no surprise in a mile-a-minute movie like this, some of the plot points won't QUITE make sense on later reflection (Just what was Rita planning to do with a human-sized jewel, could hench-rats really ride mixers like Jet Skis, and where exactly did the liquid nitrogen come from?).  However the total effect is a tidal wave (literally) of fun for the whole family.  Catch it on the big screen while you can; buy it on DVD when you get the chance.  Trust me; you won't want to miss this one!Note: The above review was written about the theater release; for the DVD,Flushed Away (Widescreen Edition), I'll just add the following: it's a good thing the movie is as great as I remembered it because the rest of the DVD was a little disappointing.  A couple of unskippable previews that have to fast-forwarded past, a couple more selectable from the main menu, a couple of animated singing slug music videos, a couple of ""making of"" featurettes, a couple of ""how to"" featurettes, a couple of video jukeboxes, one directors' commentary track, and a really lame DVD game is about it until you pop the disk in your computer, at which point you get a bunch of printables and 21 games of varying quality and playability.  The limited edition extra DVD available from some retailers adds little more: one new singing slug music video in addition to the two duplicated on the main disk, a slug cam video of a live slug, and a couple of lame DVD games.  Popping this disk in the computer yields a downloadable virtual slug, some slug-tones for your cell phone (one wonders why they didn't add any belch-tones or fart-tones), more printables, and one more game.  Oh, well, perhaps that is all we can expect from a DVD whose blurb defiantly claims it to be ""one of the year's best-REVIEWED films"", emphasis added, instead of, say, one of the biggest box office

The reason why I fell in love with Wallace and Gromit is because the Aardman people did so much with so little:  slight movements, eye expressions, and subtle humor let me get to know the characters so that when the action happened it was truly unpredictable and funny, and the same joke wasn't run into the ground.In this movie, they did so little with so much.  The animation technology really impressed me, but the characters didn't.

1043327,AHF97M45JFCB,B000M343BC,ONENEO,"[0, 1]","I suppose a bit of my own disappointment with this particular film stems from the very fact that Aardman's domestic advertising campaign coupled to DreamWorks boasting that it came from the creators of Shrek left me expecting something much more grandiose then what actually exists here.What does exist here is an 85-minute tale of one Roddy St. James (Hugh Jackman), a decidedly high-class pet rat who makes his home in a polished brass cage within in a posh Kensington flat.His high society existence comes to a screeching halt when a common sewer rat named Sid pops out of the kitchen sink and decides to stay, especially considering their home land of England happens to be playing arch nemesis Germany in the FIFA World Cup final and what posh Kensington flat isn't complete without a 60-inch flat-screen?Roddy, sensing the threat to his lifestyle that a dirty, sloppy sewer rat could pose, decides to get rid of Sid by luring him into the ""jacuzzi"", which is in fact the toilet. With the pull of the lever, he could send ol Sid back from once he came.  Classless and manner-less Sid may be, but plumbing he understands! He plays along and instead pushes Roddy into the toilet and flushes him away instead.There, Roddy meets Rita Malone (Kate Winslet), and high adventure, narrow escapes, and nautical chases ensue.Reviewers who claimed Flushed Away contains a certain British charm have hit the nail right on the head.  The humor is the odd combination of dry witty dialog (with cultural references galore) and over-the-top slapstick.  Theoretically this should be the secret to success in appealing to everyone (little something for the adults to enjoy while the youngsters snicker at the onscreen antics) but unless the viewer is prepared for the type of sublime dry dialog exchanges that happen without warning, much of the humor and charm could go undetected.I was particularly impressed with Aardman's ability to duplicate the stop-motion clay animation look of their earlier films and series through use of laser scanning and software animating.  Many of the textures are remarkably lifelike and, not unlike the dialog, require careful examination to appreciate the layers of depth and pop culture references scattered about.The vocal work is top notch with Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen delivering voice performances no less potent than the live-action deliveries that each is known for.In all Flushed Away comes off as a charming little romp with a bit more underlying depth (no pun intended) than is common in animated feature films.  It's undeniably Aardman though which means it isn't quite as in your face or over the top as a majority of the DVDs wearing the famous DreamWorks logo.",3,Charming but Not Quite Epic,1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,2715,"['suppose', 'bit', 'own', 'disappointment', 'particular', 'film', 'very', 'fact', 'Aardman', 'domestic', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'coupled', 'DreamWorks', 'boasting', 'came', 'creators', 'Shrek', 'left', 'expecting', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'grandiose', 'then', 'what', 'actually', 'here.What', 'exist', 'here', '85-minute', 'tale', 'one', 'Roddy', 'St.', 'James', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'decidedly', 'high-class', 'pet', 'rat', 'who', 'home', 'polished', 'brass', 'cage', 'posh', 'Kensington', 'flat.His', 'high', 'society', 'existence', 'screeching', 'halt', 'when', 'common', 'sewer', 'rat', 'named', 'Sid', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'stay', 'especially', 'considering', 'home', 'land', 'England', 'be', 'playing', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'Germany', 'FIFA', 'World', 'Cup', 'final', 'what', 'posh', 'Kensington', 'flat', ""n't"", 'complete', '60-inch', 'flat-screen', 'Roddy', 'sensing', 'threat', 'lifestyle', 'dirty', 'sloppy', 'sewer', 'rat', 'could', 'pose', 'decides', 'get', 'rid', 'Sid', 'luring', 'jacuzzi', 'fact', 'toilet', 'pull', 'lever', 'could', 'send', 'ol', 'Sid', 'back', 'once', 'came', 'Classless', 'manner-less', 'Sid', 'may', 'be', 'plumbing', 'along', 'instead', 'pushes', 'Roddy', 'toilet', 'flushes', 'away', 'instead.There', 'Roddy', 'Rita', 'Malone', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'high', 'adventure', 'narrow', 'escapes', 'nautical', 'chases', 'ensue.Reviewers', 'who', 'claimed', 'Flushed', 'Away', 'certain', 'British', 'charm', 'have', 'hit', 'nail', 'right', 'head', 'humor', 'odd', 'combination', 'dry', 'witty', 'dialog', 'cultural', 'references', 'galore', 'over-the-top', 'slapstick', 'Theoretically', 'should', 'be', 'secret', 'success', 'appealing', 'everyone', 'little', 'something', 'adults', 'enjoy', 'youngsters', 'snicker', 'onscreen', 'antics', 'viewer', 'prepared', 'type', 'sublime', 'dry', 'dialog', 'exchanges', 'happen', 'warning', 'much', 'humor', 'charm', 'could', 'go', 'undetected.I', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'Aardman', 'ability', 'duplicate', 'stop-motion', 'clay', 'animation', 'look', 'earlier', 'films', 'series', 'use', 'laser', 'scanning', 'software', 'animating', 'Many', 'textures', 'are', 'remarkably', 'lifelike', 'not', 'dialog', 'require', 'careful', 'examination', 'appreciate', 'layers', 'depth', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'scattered', 'about.The', 'vocal', 'work', 'top', 'notch', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'delivering', 'voice', 'less', 'potent', 'live-action', 'deliveries', 'known', 'for.In', 'Flushed', 'Away', 'off', 'charming', 'little', 'romp', 'bit', 'more', 'underlying', 'depth', 'pun', 'intended', 'common', 'animated', 'feature', 'films', 'undeniably', 'Aardman', ""n't"", 'quite', 'face', 'top', 'majority', 'DVDs', 'wearing', 'famous', 'DreamWorks', 'logo']",Flushed Away

In Flushed Away they proved that a movie can be family fun and not entirely formulaic.Plot outline:Favored house pet, Roddy St. James(Hugh Jackman)is a spoiled mouse living in splendid isolation, free to live it up in a world of his imagination, rich children's toys and no contact with any other animals. In a sudden reversal of fortune, he is flushed out of his deluxe apartment in the sky - ok its Kensington, England and down the tubes into the sewer. Here he finds a decidedly Dickensian London world inhabited by all manner of small fury and not so fury denizens.He quickly becomes involved with a truly underworld, underworld crime boss(Ian McKellen as The Toad), his heavy duty dirty rats and a beautiful mouse maiden in distress. Rita Pantsed mouse (Kate Winslet) is plucky, fiercely independent and not at all impressed with the cut of Roddy, but events keep them together on a classic jewel quest.So far all of this sounds very traditional and predictable. The structure is. The details are not.The standard model kiddie/family movie is:Lots of humor in the beginning; include a few references for the parentsAdd in some romance, but keep it at arms length, nothing to offend kiddies' sensibilities or to rouse the ""Girls are Yucky"" in the younger boy viewersSlowly add in the danger, bringing in enough violence to allow for chase scenes and maybe demonstrate some heroicsBy about the  way mark there are few or no jokes until...At the happy resolution a few final jokes are allowed to offset the resolution of the romance and some maudlin emotionsFlushed away is funny beginning to end. Yes we have chases and typical kid's movie violence. The emphasis is always on fun. The violence is more in the way of adventure than people, ok animal getting hurt.Dream Works made excellent use of the folks behind the claymation series Wallace and Grommet. Flushed Away is computer animated, but the characters have something of the warmth and physical depth that their W and G artists achieve in clay.On the personal side, I loved the chorus of singing slugs. To see such an ancient theater tradition revived is such a totally unlikely venue was hysterical. The little guys were magically used to set the tone of scene after scene and to warn the viewers on what to expect next. In other words exactly what an ancient chorus is supposed to do.Bottom line:For very few dollars you can entertain the kids, have plenty of fun for the supervising adults, and almost forget that your eating popcorn.",4,More Family fun then any thing you will have at near this price,1350691200,"10 20, 2012",2012,2729,"['movie', 'ancient', 'question', 'way', 'other', 'wise', 'restful', 'slumbers', 'parents', 'world', 'wide', 'Does', 'family', 'movie', 'have', 'be', 'written', 'Disney', 'Formula', '2006', 'Dream', 'Works', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'tied', 'Disney', 'Flushed', 'Away', 'proved', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'family', 'fun', 'not', 'entirely', 'formulaic.Plot', 'outline', 'Favored', 'house', 'pet', 'Roddy', 'St.', 'James', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'spoiled', 'mouse', 'living', 'splendid', 'isolation', 'free', 'live', 'up', 'world', 'imagination', 'rich', 'children', 'toys', 'contact', 'other', 'animals', 'sudden', 'reversal', 'fortune', 'flushed', 'deluxe', 'apartment', 'sky', 'Kensington', 'England', 'tubes', 'sewer', 'Here', 'decidedly', 'Dickensian', 'London', 'world', 'inhabited', 'manner', 'small', 'fury', 'not', 'so', 'fury', 'denizens.He', 'quickly', 'involved', 'truly', 'underworld', 'underworld', 'crime', 'boss', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Toad', 'heavy', 'duty', 'dirty', 'rats', 'beautiful', 'mouse', 'maiden', 'distress', 'Rita', 'Pantsed', 'mouse', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'plucky', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'not', 'impressed', 'cut', 'Roddy', 'events', 'keep', 'together', 'classic', 'jewel', 'quest.So', 'far', 'very', 'traditional', 'predictable', 'structure', 'details', 'are', 'not.The', 'standard', 'model', 'kiddie/family', 'movie', 'Lots', 'humor', 'beginning', 'include', 'few', 'references', 'parentsAdd', 'romance', 'keep', 'arms', 'length', 'nothing', 'offend', 'kiddies', 'sensibilities', 'rouse', 'Girls', 'are', 'Yucky', 'younger', 'boy', 'viewersSlowly', 'add', 'danger', 'bringing', 'enough', 'violence', 'allow', 'chase', 'scenes', 'maybe', 'demonstrate', 'heroicsBy', 'way', 'mark', 'are', 'few', 'jokes', 'happy', 'resolution', 'few', 'final', 'jokes', 'are', 'allowed', 'offset', 'resolution', 'romance', 'maudlin', 'emotionsFlushed', 'away', 'funny', 'beginning', 'end', 'Yes', 'have', 'chases', 'typical', 'kid', 'movie', 'violence', 'emphasis', 'always', 'fun', 'violence', 'more', 'way', 'adventure', 'people', 'ok', 'animal', 'getting', 'hurt.Dream', 'Works', 'made', 'excellent', 'use', 'folks', 'claymation', 'series', 'Wallace', 'Grommet', 'Flushed', 'Away', 'computer', 'animated', 'characters', 'have', 'something', 'warmth', 'physical', 'depth', 'W', 'G', 'artists', 'achieve', 'clay.On', 'personal', 'side', 'loved', 'chorus', 'singing', 'slugs', 'see', 'such', 'ancient', 'theater', 'tradition', 'revived', 'such', 'totally', 'unlikely', 'venue', 'was', 'hysterical', 'little', 'guys', 'were', 'magically', 'used', 'set', 'tone', 'scene', 'scene', 'warn', 'viewers', 'what', 'expect', 'next', 'other', 'words', 'exactly', 'what', 'ancient', 'chorus', 'supposed', 'do.Bottom', 'line', 'very', 'few', 'dollars', 'can', 'entertain', 'kids', 'have', 'plenty', 'fun', 'supervising', 'adults', 'almost', 'forget', 'eating', 'popcorn']",Flushed Away

The visuals are stunning, the voice talent is the best and most seamless in recent memory, and there is quite literally a laugh-a-minute (for Mom & Dad, too!).The filmmakers' attention to detail was truly remarkable.  Repeat viewings yield more and more chuckles as you'll notice smart in-jokes and running gags.  The french frog (get it?) swat team wears (what else?) frog suits.  One of them does a hilarious turn as a mime.  At their first call to action, they promptly surrender.The voice casting was truly first-rate.  Hugh Jackman plays the wide-eyed rat-out-of-comfy-cage role perfectly.  Kate Winslet infuses sassy fun into her hip, Euro-cool, street-wise rat.

Part of the appeal of their work was that they still used dolls, clay and traditional stop motion.  You could see and appreciate the time the movie took to make and almost feel the love for the art coming right through your set.  Sure CG has a place in the world of animation, but also believe firmly in keeping the older arts alive and thriving.  Aardman was doing a great job with their stop motion work; why change a good thing?Part of it was technical.  ""Flushed Away"" contains so many scenes with water and fluids rising, splashing and whirling that stop motion would have been next to impossible.  CG was the best way to handle it.  Luckily Aardman kept their traditional look to their characters.  In the end, the mix works wonderfully.  The film is dynamic, fast paced and lots of fun.  The CG helps, and doesn't stand out at all.  In fact the movie is full of details in backgrounds and throw away sight gags that you can watch it multiple times to take it all in.The voice casting and performances are excellent.  Everyone seems to be having a great time with their parts and somehow manages to make you forget you are listening to a bunch of A-list celebraties.  I'd hate to single any one performance out, because they were all so good.  The score and songs used in the film also work wonderfully.  The songs are picked because they fit the film (and are not shoehorned into the movie to sell the soundtrack), and that is refreshing.If there is anything wrong with the movie its the simple fact that the script feels overly worked to make it more family friendly.  In other words, some of the simple charms that Aardman has in their films has been polished and scrubbed away.  The film has a total of 15 writers working on it.  At times you can almost feel the number of hands working on this cake.  Some of the jokes have the feel of ""let's put this in here, because kids love that kind of stuff"".  It makes moments in the film seem a bit unnatural and not really in line with previous Aardman films.  However, I doubt anyone but a serious fan of their work would notice.With that said, I recommend this movie.  It's not as good as ""Wallace and Gromit"", but really what is?  It's great fun, and the voice acting is top notch.  Its too bad that the movie did so poorly in theaters.  it didn't deserve it at all.

This is not surprising, as Dreamworks teamed up with Aardman to make an animated film that looks more like ""Chicken Run"" than ""The Incredibles.""  Some of that quirky stop-motion sensibility has clearly permeated this film, and that is its saving grace.The plot is ordinary.  Roddy St. James (Hugh Jackman) is a pet rat in an upper-crust house in Kensington - apparently a ritzy neighborhood in London.  Roddy's owners head out for a few days' holiday, and Roddy romps around the house, playing with the toys and pretending to be James Bond.  The theme is perhaps given away by the playing of Billy Idol's ""Dancin' with Myself"" during this scene.  Future lessons about the values of friendship on the horizon, perhaps?All too soon, Roddy's idyll is invaded by Sid, a sewer rat.  Push comes to shove and Roddy's attempt to flush Sid down the toilet backfires.  Roddy falls into an alternative version of London in its sewers populated by a whole rat society, which gives the filmmakers a gazillion opportunities to make little jokes . . . and they do so in spades.  Repeat viewings are required to catch all the little gags, and they never fail to please.Roddy then gets caught up in a ridiculous jewel heist involving Rita (Kate Winslet), who has gone against the Sewer-London's crime lord, the Toad (Ian McKellen).  The Toad also has visions of sewer-domination and wiping out the rat civilization - using a clever ploy involving England's fixation on the World Cup finals.  To this end, the Toad enlists his French cousin, Le Frog (Jean Reno) and his sidekicks.  As an example of the witty British sensibility that permeates this film, when Le Frog yells ""To action!"" to rally his band of henchfrogs, the henchfrogs immediately raise their arms and shout, ""We surrender!""Look for some amazing animation in ""Flushed Away,"" particularly with some chase scenes through the sewers of London.  But the joys of this movie are found in the jokes, no doubt about it.  And while the movie is not stolen by minor characters as in some other animated movies (such as where the penguins completely swipe ""Madagascar""), a bevy of slugs do their best to provide the movie's great moments.While surely not the best animated movie out there, ""Flushed Away"" still stands out among the dreck that has piled up in recent years.  While not in the class of ""Ratatouille"" or even ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit,"" ""Flushed Away"" is nevertheless a solid entry into the family film library.

Over the flippin' hedge. Happy Feet (though that one was ok). Besides crappy romantic comedies, they're the most overdone film genre of all-time.But, as it so happens, I found myself on a bus to Six Flags in Massachusetts one day as part of a college reunion my dad was in (there was a program for the kids, and our group, age 15-17, was going to Six Flags one day), and they were showing this film, ""Flushed Away,"" on the bus.Meh. I had nothing better to do. Sleep? I just woke up like a minute and a half ago, it was 9:00 in the morning. Study for my exam I was taking off-campus on Saturday? Yeah, right. Watch ""Flushed Away"" for no apparent reason whatsoever? Sounds like a plan!Ok, so basically, ""Flushed Away"" is about this lonely (but almost scarily elated) rat named Roddy who gets flushed down the loo one day and discovers a huge underworld city in the sewers of London where other rats live. He meets this girl scavenger rat named Rita who looks for treasures in the sewers and he keeps ruining things for her on her boat...thus Rita gets a huge sense of resentment for this poor rat. Roddy needs to get back to Kensington (hehe, I love that place) where he lives...but has no plan of doing so. Rita just so happens to have a dilemma as well: she has this quarrel with a big toad named...er...the Toad who stole a ruby from her that was going to make her poor family wealthy again. Roddy agrees to help Rita get the ruby back in return for her help in getting him back to the land ""up top."" (Kensington)As you can see from my basic plot summary, ""Flushed Away"" is an odd film. It has some fantastic voice talent, though, starring Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Ian McKellen, and Bill Nighy. It also is pretty funny with tons of British humour (oh, did I mention the evil Toad is trying to rig all the toilets in London to suck the people in during the half-time break at the World Cup? hehe  ) and it reminded me immensely of Nick Park's brilliant ""Wallace and Grommit"" series. There are references to tons of other adult movies that only we would get.

1043351,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000M343BC,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 8]","Roddy (Hugh Jackman), a pet rat living in a posh house in Kensington, London, wakes up one morning to find the little girl who cares for him has gone on vacation, leaving him enough food for a month. With the house to himself, he makes a checklist of fun activities and uses the girl's other toys as companions. Later, that same evening, Roddy awakes to a strange noise and arrives in the kitchen just in time to see Sid (Shane Richie), a fat sewer rat, explode through the kitchen plumbing. When Sid realizes where he is, he quickly makes himself comfortable. Roddy is aghast at the messy intruder and comes up with a way to get rid of him. Offering his guest a Jacuzzi bath, he shows him the toilet. Sid is all for the Jacuzzi, but turns the tables on Roddy who is soon flushed away. In the sewers, the pet rat finds a miniature London populated by sewer rats, frogs and slugs. He soon meets Rita (Kate Winslet), the tough as nails skipper of a little schooner. She is wanted by the Toad (Sir Ian McKellan), the local gangster with  a brood of rat henchmen, including Whitey (Bill Nighy), a former laboratory rat who is now an albino and Spike (Andy Serkis, the Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings""), Whitey's none too bright accomplice. The Toad has a master plan and wants the ruby Rita stole from him. When they retrieve that, Rita quickly grabs the ""Master Cable"", the Toad's method of controlling the flood gate into their world. Rita and Roddy form an uneasy alliance to escape and set things right.""Flushed Away"" is a CGI Animated film from the same people who brought us the ""Wallace and Gromit"" films and ""Shrek"". If you are familiar with Wallace and Gromit, you probably know they are animated using an old fashioned technique; Claymation. The figures are made out of clay and they are moved and changed for every single frame, giving them a rounded look and making them appear three dimensional. You also frequently see thumbprints and imperfections as the characters move and change, but this is part of the charm for this type of animation.In ""Wallace and Gromit and the Curse of the Were-rabbit"", the filmmakers developed a new software program allowing them to animate the bunnies floating around in the Bun-Vac 6000, while retaining the same look of Claymation. This software was used to make all of ""Flushed Away"". Essentially, the entire film is created with CGI, but the software maintains certain imperfections and shows us an occasional thumbprint. It is an interesting idea and works well. Perhaps too well. I'm sure this new software allows for a faster production schedule, but it also allows the filmmakers to create larger, more complicated landscapes. This robs this type of animation of intimacy. In ""Curse of the Were-rabbit"", it was more than a little endearing to see Wallace and Gromit's little British village come to life. In ""Flushed Away"", Roddy enters a miniature London, complete with replicas of the London Bridge, Big Ben, Piccadilly, neon, ads, shops and more. It is just too large and makes the characters seem lost and more traditionally animated. This scene is reminiscent of the same company's ""Shark Tales""; we watch Will Smith's character swim into an underwater version of Times Square.Honestly, when I saw the trailers for ""Flushed"" I thought Roddy was voiced by Ralph Fiennes. After his appearance in ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit"", it fit. So I was shocked to learn the voice was Hugh Jackman. He does a good job of playing a rich, upper-class rat, used to a life of privilege in the Royal Borough of Kensington. Kate Winslet does a good job as Rita, the skipper of her own boat, with a large family to look after, providing for her disabled dad (David Suchet) and mum (Kathy Burke) and their ever increasing brood. But their performances are just a little too ordinary. They don't add another dimension to these characters.The real voice talent lies in the supporting cast of characters. Sir Ian McKellan seems to have a great time playing a larger than life Toad bent of controlling his little universe. He has some funny moments throughout the film; for instance when he shows off his prized collection of ceramic representations of the Royal Family, he smiles broadly like a child showing his report card, eager for a nod of approval. He is all bombast and ego as he tries to continue with his evil plan, making him a funny take off of many of the James Bond villains.Jean Reno is also amusing as Le Frog, the leader of a band of French frogs who wear leather jackets and do the bidding of their cousin, the Toad. At one point, he yells for his followers to respond and they shout ""We surrender."" Later, he is perturbed to have his coffee interrupted and throws a coin on his Parisian caf&eacute; table before hopping off.Bill Nighy is also very good as Whitey, the brain damaged henchman of the Toad. He states ""I used to be a laboratory rat. Dealt with a lot of shampoo and now I'm white."" Throughout, he adds a certain goofy charm to the role.The film contains a couple of ongoing funny jokes. When Roddy first arrives in the sewers, he encounters a large group of slugs, who are as terrified of the rat as the rat is of them. They scream a high pitched squeal and attempt to run away, but their progress is slow. Throughout the film, they return and provide a sort of Greek chorus, singing songs from the 50s and 60s, fitting for that particular moment in the film.Perhaps the funniest ongoing joke is the Mime Frog. The band of French motorcycle gang frogs have a mime who accompanies them everywhere. When they first appear, they stop for a moment, so he can do a little routine. Later, when they are confronting Rita and Roddy, Le Frog brings out a cell phone with a camera and the Mime places it in front of his face. While the Toad speaks to them from afar, the Mime acts out the Toad's gestures, pace, inflections and more. A couple of times the Toad gets exasperated with the Mime, yelling at him to do something. It is an original and funny sequence.The character transformations for Roddy and Rita happen way too fast. One moment, they are fighting each other, pairing up simply because they have to. Then they are suddenly longing for each other's company and they want to spend the rest of their lives together. This is not a subtle change and brings to mind the type of character development one would find in an animated series on television. Why couldn't they find a few more moments, another story development to make this more believable? The problem is the kids won't even notice this type of thing. It is the adult chauffeur's who will and keeps the film from joining the hallowed ranks of animated classics.During the screening, I noticed one father snoring loudly throughout the entire film. Clearly, his interest was not held. And I can't believe he was the only one.""Flushed Away"" is cute, bright, and full of energy but has story problems and the larger canvas robs the animation of any intimacy. Why try to recreate the look of Claymation in CGI if you are going to try to make the landscape huge? Claymation begs for intimacy. ""Flushed Away"" is a film sure to keep the kids happy and adults will have a few laughs. It is a good animated effort, not as good as some I have seen this year (""Cars"", ""Monster House"", Open Season"", ""Over the Hedge"") and far better than others (""Ant Bully"").Go to a bargain

1043354,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000M343BC,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 4]","""Flushed Away"" is a CG animation produced by DreamWorks and Aardman, companies that brought us wildly imaginative and hugely entertaining ""Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit."" Their new collaboration ""Flushed Away"" is as an enjoyable ride as the Oscar-winning predecessor, but the creativity and imagination of Wallace and Gromit are somehow missing.Roddy (voiced by Hugh Jackman) is a pet mouse living in a posh house in Kensington. His affluent life is suddenly over, however, when he is literally ""flushed away"" by an intruder, a sewer mouse named Sid (Shane Richie). Through the pipes Roddy goes deep down into the underworld, where he encounters a feisty, street-smart female mouse Rita (Kate Winslet), who is being chased by the scheming kingpin ""The Toad"" (Ian McKellen).""Flushed Away"" suffers from underdeveloped characters and weak storyline. Of all the animation characters I have ever seen, Roddy is probably the least interesting hero. All Roddy wants to do is going up above, back to his old house, and it is not a very difficult thing to do (Sid already did that). Hugh Jackman does his best, but voice acting is not his forte, and many of his scenes are stolen by The Toad's ridiculously incompetent henchmen Whitey and Spike (Bill Nighy and Andy Sarkis) and the singing slugs.According to IMDb, as many as five credited screenplay writers (and another six writers who did additional screenplay material) were attached to the project. But you will notice there is someone who should be here. For all funny slapstick jokes, pop culture references (""Finding Nemo"" ""Batman"" etc.) and visual detail of the London underworld, ""Flushed Away"" is a little disappointing, lacking Nick Park's creative genius.",3,Entertaining But Needs Nick Park's Creative Genius,1254528000,"10 3, 2009",2009,1728,"['Flushed', 'Away', 'CG', 'animation', 'produced', 'DreamWorks', 'Aardman', 'companies', 'brought', 'wildly', 'imaginative', 'hugely', 'entertaining', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'Curse', 'Were-Rabbit', 'new', 'collaboration', 'Flushed', 'Away', 'enjoyable', 'ride', 'Oscar-winning', 'predecessor', 'creativity', 'imagination', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'are', 'somehow', 'missing.Roddy', 'voiced', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'pet', 'mouse', 'living', 'posh', 'house', 'Kensington', 'affluent', 'life', 'suddenly', 'however', 'when', 'literally', 'flushed', 'away', 'intruder', 'sewer', 'mouse', 'named', 'Sid', 'Shane', 'Richie', 'pipes', 'Roddy', 'deep', 'down', 'underworld', 'where', 'feisty', 'street-smart', 'female', 'mouse', 'Rita', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'who', 'being', 'chased', 'scheming', 'kingpin', 'Toad', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Flushed', 'Away', 'suffers', 'underdeveloped', 'characters', 'weak', 'storyline', 'animation', 'characters', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Roddy', 'probably', 'least', 'interesting', 'hero', 'Roddy', 'do', 'going', 'up', 'back', 'old', 'house', 'not', 'very', 'difficult', 'thing', 'do', 'Sid', 'already', 'did', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'best', 'voice', 'acting', 'not', 'forte', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'stolen', 'Toad', 'ridiculously', 'incompetent', 'henchmen', 'Whitey', 'Spike', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Andy', 'Sarkis', 'singing', 'slugs.According', 'IMDb', 'as', 'many', 'five', 'credited', 'screenplay', 'writers', 'six', 'writers', 'who', 'did', 'additional', 'screenplay', 'material', 'were', 'attached', 'project', 'will', 'notice', 'someone', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'here', 'funny', 'slapstick', 'jokes', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'Batman', 'etc', 'visual', 'detail', 'London', 'underworld', 'Flushed', 'Away', 'little', 'disappointing', 'lacking', 'Nick', 'Park', 'creative', 'genius']",Flushed Away

This is a funny perspective of what happens when the family's small pets get flushed down the toilet.  Also a story that reminds us money can't buy true happinesss.  The overall plot is a variation of many other tales, rich person with everything but no family or love gets removed from their environment, finds and unexpecting person who has a family, falls for them and their family, sacrifices their wealthy way of life for the true love and family.  But this is entertaining, and the slugs are actually funny additions.  Agian, some of the humor is crude, how many groins hits can you fit into a movie, at least 3 different characters get hit in the groin. For that reason, i think this film is best suited for kids around 10 or above.

Freeman ""Zach""","[4, 10]","In Flushed Away a spoiled pet rat from Kensington (Hugh Jackman) gets flushed down the toilet and into the sewer, where he discovers a whole underground city of rats. In his quest to get back to his home on the surface, he meets a street-smart, mischevious boat captain (Kate Winslet). While trying to get back to the surface, and escape from the evil Godfather-like Toad (Ian McKellan) and his henchman, (Bill Nighy and Andy Serkis), mayhem ensues and a good family-friendly time is had by all.The 84 minute film makes up for its thin plot by throwing in singing slugs every now and then, or randomly inserting a movie reference. There are plenty of laughs here (although there are also quite a few gags that fall flat), and the voice-actors are brilliant, but the ""I'm so lonely and I never realized it"" plot line has been played out so many times (and much more effectively) that it seems a bit too bland of an ending by the time you get to it.The DVD extras are enjoyable. A short ""meet the cast"" featurette definitely provides the kind of information and peek behind the scenes that any enjoyer of animation loves to see.
