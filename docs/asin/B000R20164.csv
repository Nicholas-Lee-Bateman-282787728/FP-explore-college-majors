1078451,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B000R20164,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[12, 20]","Luckily I was able to catch this on HBO OnDemand one boring Saturday morning, expecting the typical HBO greatness and grittiness.While long, this movie is hardly epic. That is not to say it is terrible, either. There are plenty of redeeming features with regards to acting, costumes, etc.Like with any modern PC depiction of Native Americans, the conflict is strenuous, painful, and always the same way. Traditionalism vs Modernism, the almost childlike stubbornness of the Natives to live in their homelands in peace, versus the cold, inevitable need to expand of a young nation with the world in front of them to be conquered. It is always an inability for these two to adapt with one another that leads to the conflict at hand.At the center of the conflict is Sitting Bull, the chief of the Lakota tribe, resisting US expansion. On the other side is Henry Dawes, a Senator struggling fiercly against anti-Indian sentiment in the US after the slaughter of General Custer and his troops at Little Big Horn to try and resolve the conflicts between the tribes and the U.S.The other story involves Ohiyesa, an Indian boy whose father converts to Christianity and becomes anglicized, taking his son with him, where he becomes Charles Eastman, and the shining star of hope to Henry Dawes and his faction that the natives are not savages, and can be civilized.Eastman, however, cannot forget his roots, and still has hateful memories of his time in school, Ohiyesa forced to accept a Christian name or else not be called upon or allowed to pass. His story branches out with a sympathizing woman, lamely acted by Anna Paquin, who later marries him. The both of them work to help Natives on reservations, specifically with medicine and medical help.Sitting Bull, meanwhile, sees that his land is lost, and leads the remnants of his tribe to Canada, where the Canadians graciously grant them land to live on, so long as they abide by ground rules, and tolerate the presence of their ancestral rivals. They cannot, and so the tribe forces Sitting Bull to bring them back home, where they settle in to reservation life.The story is known from here, and I won't go on about it. While the story was a good one and well acted, it fell victim to a sort of reverse-stereotyping that Native Americans suffered a hundred years ago and more, depicted as godless savages. The Americans are depicted as sleazy, uncaring, selfish men who don't care at all for the plight of the Natives, and see them all as simply a pest infection that cannot be solved via extermination. Even Henry Dawes, the Senator risking everything to help the Natives, is gradually revealed as a sleazy self-serving hypocrite who cares only for advancing his career with controversial legislation.As the Americans are hellspawn sent to ravage the earth, the Natives are the helpless victims with only good in their hearts and nature in their souls. No tribal leaders seek violence against the White men, none think of exacting vengeance against individuals, and none seek to harm anyone anywhere for any reason. The Natives gathered at Wounded Knee are simply praying. Sitting Bull is simply befuddled and confused as to why he's being taken away from his home.All of this leads to a rather clumsily delivered conclusion, in which Sitting Bull is shot in a scene because the Americans felt like shooting someone in the confusion, and the massacre at Wounded Knee for pretty much the same reason.Eastman's story isn't at all resolved, as he leaves his white wife to go and find himself, in the midst of a hellish job of trying to re-name all the Natives in reservations to anglicized names.I cannot judge the novel, as I haven't read it, and wouldn't know if this was a faithful adaptation of it, but I feel that overall, this was a clumsily executed attempt at an epic. A true example of the popular phrase about shooting for the stars, and at least ending up somewhere high. This was a good movie, but not great. And certainly not as epic as it attempts to be.",3,Sorely lacking in its quest to be an epic.,1189555200,"09 12, 2007",2007,4013,"['Luckily', 'was', 'able', 'catch', 'HBO', 'OnDemand', 'one', 'boring', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'expecting', 'typical', 'HBO', 'greatness', 'grittiness.While', 'long', 'movie', 'hardly', 'epic', 'not', 'say', 'terrible', 'either', 'are', 'plenty', 'redeeming', 'features', 'regards', 'acting', 'costumes', 'modern', 'PC', 'depiction', 'Native', 'Americans', 'conflict', 'strenuous', 'painful', 'always', 'same', 'way', 'Traditionalism', 'vs', 'Modernism', 'almost', 'childlike', 'stubbornness', 'Natives', 'live', 'homelands', 'peace', 'cold', 'inevitable', 'need', 'expand', 'young', 'nation', 'world', 'front', 'be', 'conquered', 'always', 'inability', 'two', 'adapt', 'one', 'conflict', 'center', 'conflict', 'Sitting', 'Bull', 'chief', 'Lakota', 'tribe', 'resisting', 'US', 'expansion', 'other', 'side', 'Henry', 'Dawes', 'Senator', 'struggling', 'fiercly', 'anti-Indian', 'sentiment', 'US', 'slaughter', 'General', 'Custer', 'troops', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'try', 'resolve', 'conflicts', 'tribes', 'U.S.The', 'other', 'story', 'Ohiyesa', 'Indian', 'boy', 'father', 'converts', 'Christianity', 'anglicized', 'taking', 'son', 'where', 'Charles', 'Eastman', 'shining', 'star', 'hope', 'Henry', 'Dawes', 'faction', 'natives', 'are', 'not', 'savages', 'can', 'be', 'civilized.Eastman', 'however', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'roots', 'still', 'hateful', 'memories', 'time', 'school', 'Ohiyesa', 'forced', 'accept', 'Christian', 'name', 'else', 'not', 'be', 'called', 'allowed', 'pass', 'story', 'branches', 'out', 'sympathizing', 'woman', 'lamely', 'acted', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'who', 'later', 'work', 'help', 'Natives', 'reservations', 'specifically', 'medicine', 'medical', 'help.Sitting', 'Bull', 'meanwhile', 'land', 'lost', 'remnants', 'tribe', 'Canada', 'where', 'Canadians', 'graciously', 'grant', 'land', 'live', 'so', 'long', 'abide', 'ground', 'rules', 'tolerate', 'presence', 'ancestral', 'rivals', 'can', 'not', 'so', 'tribe', 'forces', 'Sitting', 'Bull', 'bring', 'back', 'home', 'where', 'settle', 'reservation', 'life.The', 'story', 'known', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'well', 'acted', 'fell', 'victim', 'sort', 'reverse-stereotyping', 'Native', 'Americans', 'suffered', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'more', 'depicted', 'godless', 'savages', 'Americans', 'are', 'depicted', 'sleazy', 'uncaring', 'selfish', 'men', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'plight', 'Natives', 'see', 'simply', 'pest', 'infection', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'solved', 'extermination', 'Even', 'Henry', 'Dawes', 'Senator', 'risking', 'everything', 'help', 'Natives', 'gradually', 'revealed', 'sleazy', 'self-serving', 'hypocrite', 'who', 'only', 'advancing', 'career', 'controversial', 'legislation.As', 'Americans', 'are', 'hellspawn', 'sent', 'ravage', 'earth', 'Natives', 'are', 'helpless', 'victims', 'only', 'good', 'hearts', 'nature', 'souls', 'tribal', 'leaders', 'seek', 'violence', 'White', 'men', 'none', 'think', 'exacting', 'vengeance', 'individuals', 'none', 'seek', 'harm', 'anyone', 'anywhere', 'reason', 'Natives', 'gathered', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'are', 'simply', 'praying', 'Sitting', 'Bull', 'simply', 'befuddled', 'confused', 'why', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'home.All', 'rather', 'clumsily', 'delivered', 'conclusion', 'Sitting', 'Bull', 'shot', 'scene', 'Americans', 'felt', 'shooting', 'someone', 'confusion', 'massacre', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'reason.Eastman', 'story', ""n't"", 'resolved', 'white', 'wife', 'go', 'find', 'midst', 'hellish', 'job', 'trying', 're-name', 'Natives', 'reservations', 'anglicized', 'names.I', 'can', 'not', 'judge', 'novel', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'feel', 'overall', 'was', 'clumsily', 'executed', 'attempt', 'epic', 'true', 'example', 'popular', 'phrase', 'shooting', 'stars', 'least', 'ending', 'up', 'somewhere', 'high', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'certainly', 'not', 'as', 'epic', 'be']",Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee

1078453,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000R20164,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[28, 30]","BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE is a somber retelling of the events leading up to the massacre at (what is now) the Wounded Knee Memorial. But this isn't a documentary. This is a made-for-TV fictional retelling, and it is the ""made-for-TV"" bit that makes this important American event lose some of its composure.The entire production flags because of the TV aspect, many of the film shots losing their impact either because of lack of attention to detail or funds (or probably both). Either way this could've been an extreme visual recollection for most viewers but instead it lacks the depth I would've liked to have seen.Regardless, there are some stellar appearances and acting within it. August Schellenberg as Sitting Bull undeniably has the most impact. Recent movie viewers will probably remember him from his portrayal as Powhatan inThe New World. The contrast between the character in The New World and here in Wounded Knee shouldn't be lost, either. Without Powhatan and Pocahontas, the white settlers at Jamestown would've perished within the first few winters. And now, in Wounded Knee, it is the white man who destroys what is left of Native American life; a terribly stark (and bloody) reality.The other notables are Adam Beach (Flags of Our Fathers) as Charles Eastman, and Aidan Quinn (Legends of the Fall) as Senator Henry Dawes. They spend a lot of time together on film and they played against/off each other exceptionally well. Charles being the ""new wave"" Indian who melds into the white man's way of life until exposed to reservation life at Pine Ridge. Henry Dawes seeing himself as ""The Great White Savior Of The Indians"" by passing legislation that loops a few nooses around the necks of the Plains Indians' way of life without even realizing it.But other actors have little to offer. Anna Paquin (X-Men) as Charles' white love interest (and eventual wife) is seen too infrequently so the relationship between the two has little impact. She does a good job of acting but the script stymied any possibility of real success. From here the acting dips into the drab and boring. I have to give mention to Senator Fred Thompson (currently a Republican runner for the U.S. Presidency) who plays President Ulysses S. Grant. We see maybe four frames of film with him in it and then he's gone. This surprised me greatly since it was Grant's administration that doomed Native Americans by rounding them up and placing them on reservations.Despite my misgivings about the script, cinematography and acting, this is a vital story that needs to be told, and it isn't something that is normally taught in grade school or higher. Europeans (us) conquered this land and its people, and pushed them into holding pens where they, to this day, await justice for our multiple treaty violations and massacres of their men, women and children (I will say that the scenes depicting large-caliber rifle bullets ripping through young kids was filmed well and was equally hard to watch).So the story gives this film a higher rating than anything within it, which is unfortunate, as this terrible moment in American history needs to be remembered just as much as Germany needs to remember its holocaust.",4,The Story Shines Brighter Than Anything Within The Film,1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,3199,"['BURY', 'MY', 'HEART', 'AT', 'WOUNDED', 'KNEE', 'somber', 'retelling', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'massacre', 'what', 'now', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'Memorial', ""n't"", 'documentary', 'made-for-TV', 'fictional', 'retelling', 'made-for-TV', 'bit', 'important', 'American', 'event', 'lose', 'composure.The', 'entire', 'production', 'flags', 'TV', 'aspect', 'many', 'film', 'shots', 'losing', 'impact', 'lack', 'attention', 'detail', 'funds', 'probably', 'way', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'extreme', 'visual', 'recollection', 'most', 'viewers', 'instead', 'depth', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'seen.Regardless', 'are', 'stellar', 'appearances', 'acting', 'August', 'Schellenberg', 'Sitting', 'Bull', 'undeniably', 'most', 'impact', 'Recent', 'movie', 'viewers', 'will', 'probably', 'remember', 'portrayal', 'Powhatan', 'inThe', 'New', 'World', 'contrast', 'character', 'New', 'World', 'here', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'lost', 'Powhatan', 'Pocahontas', 'white', 'settlers', 'Jamestown', 'would', ""'ve"", 'perished', 'first', 'few', 'winters', 'now', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'white', 'man', 'who', 'what', 'left', 'Native', 'American', 'life', 'terribly', 'stark', 'bloody', 'other', 'notables', 'are', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'Charles', 'Eastman', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'Senator', 'Henry', 'Dawes', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'together', 'film', 'played', 'against/off', 'other', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'Charles', 'being', 'new', 'wave', 'Indian', 'who', 'white', 'man', 'way', 'life', 'exposed', 'reservation', 'life', 'Pine', 'Ridge', 'Henry', 'Dawes', 'seeing', 'Great', 'White', 'Savior', 'Indians', 'passing', 'legislation', 'few', 'nooses', 'necks', 'Plains', 'Indians', 'way', 'life', 'even', 'realizing', 'it.But', 'other', 'actors', 'have', 'little', 'offer', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'X-Men', 'Charles', 'white', 'love', 'interest', 'eventual', 'wife', 'seen', 'too', 'infrequently', 'relationship', 'two', 'little', 'impact', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'script', 'stymied', 'possibility', 'real', 'success', 'here', 'acting', 'dips', 'drab', 'boring', 'have', 'give', 'mention', 'Senator', 'Fred', 'Thompson', 'currently', 'Republican', 'runner', 'U.S.', 'Presidency', 'who', 'President', 'Ulysses', 'S.', 'Grant', 'see', 'maybe', 'four', 'frames', 'film', 'then', 'gone', 'surprised', 'greatly', 'was', 'Grant', 'administration', 'doomed', 'Native', 'Americans', 'rounding', 'up', 'placing', 'reservations.Despite', 'misgivings', 'script', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'vital', 'story', 'be', 'told', ""n't"", 'something', 'normally', 'taught', 'grade', 'school', 'higher', 'Europeans', 'conquered', 'land', 'people', 'pushed', 'holding', 'pens', 'where', 'day', 'await', 'justice', 'multiple', 'treaty', 'violations', 'massacres', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'will', 'say', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'large-caliber', 'rifle', 'bullets', 'ripping', 'young', 'kids', 'was', 'filmed', 'well', 'was', 'equally', 'hard', 'watch', '.So', 'story', 'film', 'higher', 'rating', 'anything', 'unfortunate', 'terrible', 'moment', 'American', 'history', 'needs', 'be', 'remembered', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Germany', 'remember', 'holocaust']",Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee

1078461,A2YDESWJL4P3WV,B000R20164,James A. Holland,"[105, 116]","Bury My Heart....is a decent film. I always welcome any film that, respectfully and honestly, tries to deal with native american subject matters.However; this film was simply too riddled with historical inaccuracies to be what it should have been.The first problem arises in that Dee Brown's book in itself romantizises the massacre at wounded knee. To base a film on a book that is already flawed, from a native point of view, is tatamount to building a house on quicksand.Ok let's look at the character of Ohiysa, or Dr. Charles Eastman, portrayed by Adam Beach.Ohiyesa was Whappeton-Sisseton DAKOTA....in the film he is portrayed as LAKOTA. To most people that won't matter much, but for both the Lakota and Dakota people it does.He sometimes speaks in Lakota....which, as a Dakota, he most certainly would not have. True, both dialects are mutually understandable and are of siouan origin, but Ohiyesa would certainly have spoken his Whappeton Dakota dialect....not the Oglalla Lakota dialect.Then he is placed in the wrong place and time. Ohiyesa was nowhere near the greasy grass (little big-horn) when the lakota camp was attacked by Reno and his men. In fact, he was a state away up in North Dakota or further over in Minnesota....not in Montana where the battle took place.Neither was he ever close to the wounded knee massacre. He WAS the agency physician at Pine Ridge, Oglalla Lakota Reservation, but not at the time of the battle at wounded knee.Chief Tatanka Iyotake...Sitting Bull. August Schellenberg did a good job with the script he was given. What bothers me however, is that in almost all native type movies the actors are forced to speak in a very awckward manner which comes across as phoney and contrieved. As though natives would have spoken that way in their own language.Anyhow. Tatanka Iyotake comes across as somewhat of a jerk and I feel that the way he was pertrayed took much away from the real Sitting Bull...not that I knew the man of course. However; Sitting Bull was a wicasa wakan...a holy man amongst his Hunkpapa people and I doubt he would have conducted himself as arrogantly and foolishly as he was made to look in this film. Also, he never came to Pine Ridge...much less did he surrender there. He surrendered at Ft. Robinson Nebraska.....the same place where Tashunke Witko...Chief Crazy Horse surrendered and where he was murdered by the U.S. Govt. They did get it right that Sitting Bull was murdered on his Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota.Again, these inaccuracies may not seem like a big deal to most, but I doubt ANY american would take kindly to a foreigen nation making a film about, say Pearl Harbor, but confuse names, events and places of major american figures along the way. Imagine, a foreigen produced film about Pearl Harbor, with Gen. Mc Arthur invading China instead of Japan, and Pearl Harbor being set on the coast of Maine. Wouldn't go over well would it? Now imagine how the decendants of the native side of wounded knee feel when the story of their ancestors is constantly told in a haphazzard manner.Point made.There are a few other things wrong with this film. In the last frames of the film Chief Makhpia Luta...Red Cloud, is shown riding on a wagon, as Ohiyesa and his wife bare witness to the aftermath of the massacre. Red Cloud was not at wounded knee. He was at Pine Ridge at the time yes, but he did not visit the killing field because he was afraid that more violence would errupt. Beyond that, he had gone blind and was in frail health at the time of the massacre....he couldn't have gone even if he had wanted to.All in all the acting was anywhere from great to ok, but given the lame script and dialogue there was not much any of the actors could have done. The cinematography was very good, as were the costumes....at least here they paid attention to detail in ditinguishing the Arikira from the Crow and the Crow from the Lakota...as each tribe had it's own very distinctive dress and appearance forms.One last note on Dr. Eastman. In the film he is shown as being desolate toward the end and out of work when he, in fact, went on to publish many books and was, even in his day, recognized as a writer and orator of great renown.From my perspective it is hard to get around the inaccuracies and the torrid dialogue, but given the scarsity of cerdible native themed films...still and ever, I take it for what it is and give it 3 stars.",3,Inaccurate,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,4425,"['Bury', 'My', 'Heart', 'decent', 'film', 'always', 'welcome', 'film', 'respectfully', 'honestly', 'tries', 'deal', 'native', 'american',

1078463,A140XH16IKR4B0,B000R20164,Jean E. Pouliot,"[3, 3]","An arrow launched bravely, but falls shortI read Dee Brown's classic story about the brutal, tragic history of White-Indian relations back in the early 1970s when I was in high school. Ranging as it does over 400 years of American history, from Columbus to the early 20th century, the book seemed impervious to adaptation to television. But HBO has done a creditable job of bringing a slice of Brown's blood-soaked tale to the small screen. To do so, HBO had to cut away much of Brown's wide-ranging narrative, and might have cut even more to keep from confusing the audience with too many characters. HBO spliced onto the story the tale of Charles Eastman, a Dartmouth-trained doctor who grew up as a Sioux. Eastman's story functions as a splint that holds together the disparate shards of Indian history that culminate at Wounded Knee. It also serves as a bridge between the worlds of Washington DC, where decisions about Indian affairs were made, and the distant battlefields and reservations where those decisions were implemented.""Bury My Heart"" focuses mostly on the stories of chiefs Red Cloud and Sitting Bull, who lead some of the last bands of Indian holdouts against assimilation into white society. The film depicts Sioux life as harsh, yet happy and robust. Tepees sprout in harmony along rivers and streams. Children play happily, hunters bring home the abundant game and families sit cozily around campfires. But all goes awry when whites encroach on Indian lands, and especially when gold is discovered in the Black Hills, sacred to the Sioux. Suddenly, the iron-clad treaties that whites had negotiated with the Sioux are treated as fungible, and deal after deal is shoved down the throats of these bands whose firepower is vastly outbalanced by white guns and rapaciousness. The final ""battle"" -- if gunning down hundreds of unarmed and sick Indian men, women and children can be ennobled by that word -- occurs with horrifying finality at Wounded Knee Creek.The film is strongest where it shows important events that rarely make it into the history books. The ""education"" (really, indoctrination) of young Indians by white teachers, Little Bighorn, Sitting Bull's death (assassination is not a stretch), the Sioux emigration into Canada, and the final battle are well-depicted. The ongoing debates between government ""progressives"" (who wanted to save Indians from extermination by forced assimilation into white ways) and the militants (who wanted to kill them off outright) shows the lack of understanding and respect that hampered white's ability to deal with the Indians fairly. Where the film falls short is in depicting the emotions and subtleties of the interaction. There are no scenes showing gold-crazed whites pushing into Indian lands. Treaties with Indians are shown, accompanied by maps, but it's hard for the uneducated viewer to quite understand the issues. An interaction between Sitting Bull and Phil Sheridan gives the American general the opportunity to trash the Sioux version of its history, but gives next to no space to the Sioux view, suggesting that Sheridan was correct. Most importantly, the film skirts the issue of race. This was especially evident in the love story between Sioux Charles Eastman and his white wife-to-be, Elaine Goodale. Everyone seems thrilled that these two young people were getting together. But given the tenor of times, it's hard to believed that a red man marrying a white woman would have been acceptable to most people.Still, the film provides indelible images of the campaign of white atrocities and duplicities that drove the outgunned Indians from their lands. An Indian chief's frozen body is flipped on its back to facilitate a photographer; an endless series of tepees stretches along the Little Big Horn as the battle rages; Indians literally ""touch pen"" to the implements that signify their assent to a document; Hotchkiss guns hurl deadly shells at fleeing Indians; an old man drags young boy after he has been cut down.In spite of its many deficiencies, ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"" is worthy of watching -- especially for an amazing performance by part-Mohawk August Schellenberg, who gave his role of Sitting Bull the ferocity, gravitas and dignity that made him completely believable as the fearsome Sioux war chief.",4,"An arrow launched bravely, but falls short",1261440000,"12 22, 2009",2009,4308,"['arrow', 'launched', 'bravely', 'shortI', 'read', 'Dee', 'Brown', 'classic', 'story', 'brutal', 'tragic', 'history', 'White-Indian', 'relations', 'back', 'early', '1970s', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'Ranging', '400', 'years', 'American', 'history', 'Columbus', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'book', 'seemed', 'impervious', 'adaptation', 'television', 'HBO', 'done', 'creditable', 'job', 'bringing', 'slice', 'Brown', 'blood-soaked', 'tale', 'small', 'screen', 'do', 'so', 'HBO', 'had', 'cut', 'away', 'much', 'Brown', 'wide-ranging', 'narrative', 'might', 'have', 'cut', 'even', 'more', 'keep', 'confusing', 'audience', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'HBO', 'spliced', 'story', 'tale', 'Charles', 'Eastman', 'Dartmouth-trained', 'doctor', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Sioux', 'Eastman', 'story', 'functions', 'splint', 'together', 'disparate', 'shards', 'Indian', 'history', 'culminate', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'also', 'bridge', 'worlds', 'Washington', 'DC', 'where', 'decisions', 'Indian', 'affairs', 'were', 'made', 'distant', 'battlefields', 'reservations', 'where', 'decisions', 'were', 'implemented', 'Bury', 'My', 'Heart', 'mostly', 'stories', 'chiefs', 'Red', 'Cloud', 'Sitting', 'Bull', 'who', 'lead', 'last', 'bands', 'Indian', 'holdouts', 'assimilation', 'white', 'society', 'film', 'Sioux', 'life', 'harsh', 'happy', 'robust', 'Tepees', 'sprout', 'harmony', 'rivers', 'streams', 'Children', 'play', 'happily', 'hunters', 'bring', 'home', 'abundant', 'game', 'families', 'sit', 'cozily', 'campfires', 'awry', 'when', 'whites', 'encroach', 'Indian', 'lands', 'especially', 'when', 'gold', 'discovered', 'Black', 'Hills', 'sacred', 'Sioux', 'Suddenly', 'iron-clad', 'treaties', 'whites', 'had', 'negotiated', 'Sioux', 'are', 'treated', 'fungible', 'deal', 'deal', 'shoved', 'down', 'throats', 'bands', 'firepower', 'vastly', 'outbalanced', 'white', 'guns', 'rapaciousness', 'final', 'battle', 'gunning', 'down', 'hundreds', 'unarmed', 'sick', 'Indian', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'can', 'be', 'ennobled', 'word', 'horrifying', 'finality', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'Creek.The', 'film', 'strongest', 'where', 'important', 'events', 'rarely', 'make', 'history', 'books', 'education', 'really', 'indoctrination', 'young', 'Indians', 'white', 'teachers', 'Little', 'Bighorn', 'Sitting', 'Bull', 'death', 'assassination', 'not', 'stretch', 'Sioux', 'emigration', 'Canada', 'final', 'battle', 'are', 'well-depicted', 'ongoing', 'debates', 'government', 'progressives', 'who', 'wanted', 'save', 'Indians', 'extermination', 'forced', 'assimilation', 'white', 'ways', 'militants', 'who', 'wanted', 'kill', 'off', 'outright', 'lack', 'understanding', 'respect', 'hampered', 'white', 'ability', 'deal', 'Indians', 'fairly', 'Where', 'film', 'short', 'depicting', 'emotions', 'subtleties', 'interaction', 'are', 'scenes', 'showing', 'gold-crazed', 'whites', 'pushing', 'Indian', 'lands', 'Treaties', 'Indians', 'are', 'shown', 'accompanied', 'maps', 'hard', 'uneducated', 'viewer', 'quite', 'understand', 'issues', 'interaction', 'Sitting', 'Bull', 'Phil', 'Sheridan', 'American', 'general', 'opportunity', 'trash', 'Sioux', 'version', 'history', 'next', 'space', 'Sioux', 'view', 'suggesting', 'Sheridan', 'was', 'correct', 'Most', 'importantly', 'film', 'issue', 'race', 'was', 'especially', 'evident', 'love', 'story', 'Sioux', 'Charles', 'Eastman', 'white', 'wife-to-be', 'Elaine', 'Goodale', 'Everyone', 'thrilled', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'were', 'getting', 'together', 'given', 'tenor', 'times', 'hard', 'believed', 'red', 'man', 'marrying', 'white', 'woman', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'acceptable', 'most', 'people.Still', 'film', 'indelible', 'images', 'campaign', 'white', 'atrocities', 'duplicities', 'drove', 'outgunned', 'Indians', 'lands', 'Indian', 'chief', 'frozen', 'body', 'flipped', 'back', 'facilitate', 'photographer', 'endless', 'series', 'tepees', 'stretches', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'battle', 'Indians', 'literally', 'touch', 'pen', 'implements', 'signify', 'assent', 'document', 'Hotchkiss', 'deadly', 'shells', 'fleeing', 'Indians', 'old', 'man', 'young', 'boy', 'been', 'cut', 'down.In', 'spite', 'many', 'deficiencies', 'Bury', 'My', 'Heart', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'worthy', 'watching', 'especially', 'amazing', 'performance', 'part-Mohawk', 'August', 'Schellenberg', 'who', 'gave', 'role', 'Sitting', 'Bull', 'ferocity', 'gravitas', 'dignity', 'made', 'completely', 'believable', 'fearsome', 'Sioux', 'war', 'chief']",Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee

You have been warned.The similarities of blacks and Indians/Native Americans are just so in your face, it's hard not to notice and say something. I'm black myself and admittedly sometimes I'm fixated on the black man's plight. Not in a victimology way, in a that's interesting and sad way.Indians/Native Americans couldn't understand, at the time, that assimilation into the white world was the only choice that remained. American whites didn't invent how the world works, they are just much better at taking advantage of how it works. White folks, that's nothing to be ashamed of. Hell, you should be celebrating it. After all, what's the alternative? Would you like to switch positions with the Sub Saharan Africans for example? Maybe you'd like to switch with the Northern Africans then? That part of the world clearly can't adapt quickly to ever evolving world conditions.Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is a very powerful read. The movie wasn't great but does present a clear understanding of Indian/Native Americans dilemma in the later half of the 19th century. The path, for natives, was pretty simple but incredibly difficult to accept, by the first and second generation natives. Even though they have lived by these types of rules the ENTIRE time they dominated the Americas, it was totally unacceptable to be dominated by another race using those same rules. The world is governed by the aggressive use of force. Whom would you rather have THE FORCE? There won't be a vacuum for very long WHEN America falls. With the apparent rise of China the next couple of 50 years could be very scary indeed.

Crawford,"[0, 0]","I do not have the expertise to critique the historical accuracy of this film in detail, but I nonetheless think it was a great success as a viewing experience that is moving, informative, and superlatively acted.  I watched it with my son, whose curiosity I hoped to spark after the raucously wonderful and sad Little Big Man.  THe film leaves you with a hunger to learn more, a sure sign of success.The story begins essentially at the moment that  Little Big Man ends, with the last big triumph of the Indians in their fight to preserve their land and way of life.  The principal character, a gifted boy (Charles, as he is later named at random in order to participate in school), is sent to get an education among the whites, eventually going to medical school with the sponsorship of a US Senator, Dawes.  The boy excels and is co-opted into helping Dawes in his attempt to reach a settlement with the Sioux and several other tribes on reservations, after their traditional lands had been expropriated.  He moves from hope to disillusion, of course, in a kind of personal crisis of conscience that is painful to watch.The other big characters include Sitting Bull, a subtle portrait that shows how he is losing his prestige yet still can muster a following to resist the policies that, however well intentioned Dawes might have been, are administered not just poorly but brutally.  He is a man who witnessed the destruction of his culture and way of being, from the first encroachments by whites until he is summarily executed in the terrible incident known as the Wounded Knee massacre.  There is also CHarles' wife, a remarkable woman of empathy and spirit who serves as a witness with him to what can only be called clumsy ethnic cleansing.  It is horrible and heartbreaking to watch.Not only are the policy details covered adequately, but the existential crises at the heart of the end of the old ways are moving portrayed in characters.  To be sure, though based on historical figures, the film adds novelistic inaccuracies to move the story along succinctly.  These inaccuracies, such as placing Charles at the Battle of Little Bighorn, do not help for the credibility of the film, but they work as plot devices.  Indeed, it would have been nearly impossible to pack the information they had to include into the 2-hour format if they hadn't - and it would have been to do a longer series.  The characters cover the full range, from insensitive and caring whites to adaptable Indians and those who fell victim to bizarre cults that mixed messianic Christian visions with apocalyptic predictions for the fate of whites.  It is as nuanced as you can get in a film.Recommended warmly.",4,"moving, if historically flawed, narrative evocation of tragic ends",1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,2689,"['do', 'not', 'have', 'expertise', 'critique', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'film', 'detail', 'nonetheless', 'think', 'was', 'great', 'success', 'viewing', 'experience', 'moving', 'informative', 'superlatively', 'acted', 'watched', 'son', 'curiosity', 'hoped', 'spark', 'raucously', 'wonderful', 'sad', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'THe', 'film', 'hunger', 'learn', 'more', 'sure', 'sign', 'success.The', 'story', 'essentially', 'moment', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'last', 'big', 'triumph', 'Indians', 'fight', 'preserve', 'land', 'way', 'life', 'principal', 'character', 'gifted', 'boy', 'Charles', 'later', 'named', 'random', 'order', 'participate', 'school', 'sent', 'get', 'education', 'whites', 'eventually', 'going', 'medical', 'school', 'sponsorship', 'US', 'Senator', 'Dawes', 'boy', 'excels', 'co-opted', 'helping', 'Dawes', 'attempt', 'reach', 'settlement', 'Sioux', 'several', 'other', 'tribes', 'reservations', 'traditional', 'lands', 'had', 'been', 'expropriated', 'hope', 'disillusion', 'course', 'kind', 'personal', 'crisis', 'conscience', 'painful', 'watch.The', 'other', 'big', 'characters', 'include', 'Sitting', 'Bull', 'subtle', 'portrait', 'how', 'losing', 'prestige', 'yet', 'still', 'can', 'muster', 'following', 'resist', 'policies', 'however', 'well', 'intentioned', 'Dawes', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'administered', 'not', 'just', 'poorly', 'brutally', 'man', 'who', 'witnessed', 'destruction', 'culture', 'way', 'being', 'first', 'encroachments', 'whites', 'summarily', 'executed', 'terrible', 'incident', 'known', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'massacre', 'also', 'CHarles', 'wife', 'remarkable', 'woman', 'empathy', 'spirit', 'who', 'witness', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', 'clumsy', 'ethnic', 'cleansing', 'horrible', 'heartbreaking', 'watch.Not', 'only', 'are', 'policy', 'details', 'covered', 'adequately', 'existential', 'crises', 'heart', 'end', 'old', 'ways', 'are', 'moving', 'portrayed', 'characters', 'be', 'sure', 'though', 'based', 'historical', 'figures', 'film', 'novelistic', 'inaccuracies', 'move', 'story', 'along', 'succinctly', 'inaccuracies', 'such', 'placing', 'Charles', 'Battle', 'Little', 'Bighorn', 'do', 'not', 'help', 'credibility', 'film', 'work', 'plot', 'devices', 'Indeed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'pack', 'information', 'had', 'include', '2-hour', 'format', 'had', ""n't"", 'would', 'have', 'been', 'do', 'longer', 'series', 'characters', 'cover', 'full', 'range', 'insensitive', 'caring', 'whites', 'adaptable', 'Indians', 'who', 'fell', 'victim', 'bizarre', 'cults', 'mixed', 'messianic', 'Christian', 'visions', 'apocalyptic', 'predictions', 'fate', 'whites', 'as', 'nuanced', 'can', 'get', 'film.Recommended', 'warmly']",Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee

I'm not completely sure, but I think I'd have to say for now that Schellenberg is probably the best Sitting Bull on film yet--even though he's been played well a number of times in recent years. Some other Native people have told me they had mixed feelings about the portrayal of Sitting Bull [it's painful], but I felt that it actually captured a deeper and more subtle tragedy behind the events that other films on this subject don't bring out as much: the way the government manipulated tribes and tribal members to attempt to set them against each other, all while steadily attacking the dignity of each individual (and their ancestors). I'd have to say that this film brought out the shame factor big-time, and that is very, very hard to watch coming from my culture. Yet as much as it might seem disrespectful, I think in this case it's important for Americans to acknowledge this aspect of the injustice and understand the magnitude of it.On a side note, I have to admit that I resent the inappropriate and melodramatic subtitle ""The Epic Fall of the American Indian"" as it implies some kind of extinction is in effect. Maybe your town/city is Native-free, but Ishi the last Yahi is not the reality of every tribe! I get tired of hearing people feeling bad about what white people did in the past without realizing that they can do something positive in the present.
