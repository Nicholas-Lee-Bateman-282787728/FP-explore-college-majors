666497,A1J87C2DKBO441,B00005N5QV,A. Evans,"[6, 6]","Seeing this film left me sad that we don't have similar documentaries available for other periods of great economic change.  The realism here, like others have said, is intact.  As someone who has lived through a startup I couldn't help but reminisce every single problem and success these guys endured.  There's a lesson here if this truly is a recurring blueprint for the birth of a company (possibly captured more succinctly by FJ Lennon in 'Every Mistake in the Book').While the movie falls short in documenting the real decline of the mechanics of their business it excels in showing the decline on the people side.  The greed, insecurities, ambitions, and pettiness of each person is brought out to varying degrees based on how well or badly things are going.  The personalities of people who you feel you have a grip on, change before your very eyes.  How much more exciting it is to see a 'reality' show that's not provoking people into being interesting.  The strains and successes provide the catalyst for an incredibly interesting people dynamic.  And ultimately why the dream of working at a company with your best friends invokes the thought that one should be careful what they wish for.The film makers do a particularly strong job of being in the right place at the right time to capture key events.  And it all hauntingly reflects my experiences.  From the embarassing 'rah rah'/'go team' meetings to the vicious reality of the VC prostitution circuit to the joy of hitting key milestones like the public release of their website or securing money to the greed that sinks its teeth into people who don't pull their weight and are called on it to the daunting realization that all hope is lost and one is in way over one's head to the final reflection on the wreckage that is left - it is all here.For those who sat back during this crazy period in comfortable safe jobs, it is a chance to see what all the fuss was about.  For those who lived this, it is a chance to reflect on what seemed like a path we controlled yet in reality was a long corridor we chose to travel down in straitjackets with an exit sign at the end beyond which lies the big train wreck.",4,Fly on the wall,994636800,"07 9, 2001",2001,2175,"['Seeing', 'film', 'left', 'sad', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'similar', 'documentaries', 'available', 'other', 'periods', 'great', 'economic', 'change', 'realism', 'here', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'intact', 'someone', 'who', 'lived', 'startup', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'reminisce', 'single', 'problem', 'success', 'guys', 'endured', 'lesson', 'here', 'truly', 'recurring', 'blueprint', 'birth', 'company', 'possibly', 'captured', 'more', 'succinctly', 'FJ', 'Lennon', ""'Every"", 'Mistake', 'Book', 'movie', 'short', 'documenting', 'real', 'decline', 'mechanics', 'business', 'showing', 'decline', 'people', 'side', 'greed', 'insecurities', 'ambitions', 'pettiness', 'person', 'brought', 'out', 'varying', 'degrees', 'based', 'how', 'well', 'badly', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'personalities', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'have', 'grip', 'change', 'very', 'eyes', 'How', 'much', 'more', 'exciting', 'see', ""'reality"", 'show', 'not', 'provoking', 'people', 'being', 'interesting', 'strains', 'successes', 'provide', 'catalyst', 'incredibly', 'interesting', 'people', 'dynamic', 'ultimately', 'why', 'dream', 'working', 'company', 'best', 'friends', 'thought', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'for.The', 'film', 'makers', 'do', 'particularly', 'strong', 'job', 'being', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'capture', 'key', 'events', 'hauntingly', 'experiences', 'embarassing', ""'rah"", ""rah'/'go"", 'team', 'meetings', 'vicious', 'reality', 'VC', 'prostitution', 'circuit', 'joy', 'hitting', 'key', 'milestones', 'public', 'release', 'website', 'securing', 'money', 'greed', 'teeth', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'pull', 'weight', 'are', 'called', 'daunting', 'realization', 'hope', 'lost', 'one', 'way', 'one', 'head', 'final', 'reflection', 'wreckage', 'left', 'here.For', 'who', 'sat', 'back', 'crazy', 'period', 'comfortable', 'safe', 'jobs', 'chance', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about', 'who', 'lived', 'chance', 'reflect', 'seemed', 'path', 'controlled', 'yet', 'reality', 'was', 'long', 'corridor', 'chose', 'travel', 'down', 'straitjackets', 'exit', 'sign', 'end', 'big', 'train', 'wreck']",N/A

The film chronicles 18 months in their lives as the pair strive to make their dream a reality; eventually  reaching a level of success uncanny for such a short period, rubbing shoulders with President Clinton (I was disappointed that Bill didn't produce one of his famous cigars and ask Kaleil for a light, all the while wiggling his eyebrows like Groucho Marx) and then ultimately watching it come crashing down around them. Could Tuzman's astronomical ego and jet turbine sized motor-mouth be to blame? Watch this and judge for yourself.STARTUP.COM is possibly one of the best documentaries I've ever seen, despite the two main protagonists being self- absorbed poindexters gone haywire. Essential viewing for anybody who harbors similar ambitions; this will give you an idea of what NOT to do. It's only Tuzman's arrogance that prevents STARTUP.COM from getting 5 stars; though Herman is equally bad by neglecting his adorable little girl and attractive wife (How is it possible?) in order to become rich and powerful.Finally, it's interesting to note that throughout the film from shot to shot Herman's face keeps changing: One shot he has a beard, then he's clean shaven, then beard again, then he's trimmed it to a goatee. Directors Jehane Noujaim and Chris Hegedus even go so far as showing a sequence of Herman shaving his beard off. Is this a subtle attempt at demonstrating the ""cut-throat"" world of entrepeneurship? A case of ""hair today, gone tomorrow?"" I'm still scratching my noodle at the complexity of it all.DVD extras include a commentary track, the trailer and profiles for the Directors and Herman and Tuzman.",4,From STARTUP.COM to STARTUP.BOMB.,1056844800,"06 29, 2003",2003,1830,"['STARTUP.COM', 'fascinating', 'documentry/', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'centering', 'Kaleil', 'Tuzman', 'Tom', 'Herman', 'two', 'childhood', 'friends', 'who', 'hit', 'bright', 'idea', 'establishing', 'company', 'named', 'govworks.com', 'film', '18', 'months', 'lives', 'pair', 'strive', 'make', 'dream', 'reality', 'eventually', 'reaching', 'level', 'success', 'uncanny', 'short', 'period', 'rubbing', 'shoulders', 'President', 'Clinton', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Bill', 'did', ""n't"", 'produce', 'one', 'famous', 'cigars', 'ask', 'Kaleil', 'light', 'while', 'wiggling', 'eyebrows', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'then', 'ultimately', 'watching', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'Could', 'Tuzman', 'astronomical', 'ego', 'jet', 'turbine', 'sized', 'motor-mouth', 'be', 'blame', 'Watch', 'judge', 'yourself.STARTUP.COM', 'possibly', 'one', 'best', 'documentaries', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'two', 'main', 'protagonists', 'being', 'self-', 'absorbed', 'poindexters', 'gone', 'haywire', 'Essential', 'viewing', 'anybody', 'who', 'similar', 'ambitions', 'will', 'give', 'idea', 'what', 'NOT', 'do', 'only', 'Tuzman', 'arrogance', 'prevents', 'STARTUP.COM', 'getting', '5', 'stars', 'Herman', 'equally', 'bad', 'neglecting', 'adorable', 'little', 'girl', 'attractive', 'wife', 'How', 'possible', 'order', 'become', 'rich', 'powerful.Finally', 'interesting', 'note', 'film', 'shot', 'shot', 'Herman', 'face', 'changing', 'One', 'shot', 'beard', 'then', 'clean', 'shaven', 'then', 'beard', 'again', 'then', 'trimmed', 'goatee', 'Directors', 'Jehane', 'Noujaim', 'Chris', 'Hegedus', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'showing', 'sequence', 'Herman', 'shaving', 'beard', 'subtle', 'attempt', 'demonstrating', 'cut-throat', 'world', 'entrepeneurship', 'case', 'hair', 'today', 'gone', 'tomorrow', ""'m"", 'still', 'scratching', 'noodle', 'complexity', 'extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'track', 'trailer', 'profiles', 'Directors', 'Herman', 'Tuzman']",N/A

The two main players, Kaleil, a born salesman, and Tom, the techno person, go from rags to riches to rags again in the frenzied arena of the dot com revolution, with their idea for an e-commerce site that would allow people to pay parking tickets online.At the beginning, when they started to get financial backing, they were not even sure of what they were going to put online! I was amazed at the financing they were able to obtain, $60 million, based on only an idea, nothing tangible. I guess that is why I am not an enterpreneur!I liked the format and never felt that Tom and Kaleil were playing to the camera....I think they were so self-absorbed that it just did not matter. Watching their failure, even though the viewer knew in advance that it was going to happen, was really painful to see, especially the possiblity that a long-term friendship might end. The clash of their personal and business philosophies was starkly revealed by the cameras: Kaleil is confident and brash; Tom is more laid back, but capable in a quiet way. Both work at a frenetic pace with cell phones sprouting from their heads, never sleeping, never eating right. It is a wonder they did not collapse.I would have liked to have known a little more about the backgrounds of the main players in this drama....what they had done after college, their family dynamics and so on.",4,A Real and Painful View,1006992000,"11 29, 2001",2001,1477,"['documentary', 'was', 'voyeuristic', 'look', 'rise', 'fall', 'dream', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'friends', 'high', 'school', 'two', 'main', 'players', 'Kaleil', 'born', 'salesman', 'Tom', 'techno', 'person', 'go', 'rags', 'riches', 'rags', 'again', 'frenzied', 'arena', 'dot', 'com', 'revolution', 'idea', 'e-commerce', 'site', 'would', 'allow', 'people', 'pay', 'parking', 'tickets', 'online.At', 'beginning', 'when', 'started', 'get', 'financial', 'backing', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'put', 'online', 'was', 'amazed', 'financing', 'were', 'able', 'obtain', '60', 'million', 'based', 'only', 'idea', 'nothing', 'tangible', 'guess', 'why', 'am', 'not', 'enterpreneur', 'liked', 'format', 'never', 'felt', 'Tom', 'Kaleil', 'were', 'playing', 'camera', 'think', 'were', 'so', 'self-absorbed', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'matter', 'Watching', 'failure', 'even', 'viewer', 'knew', 'advance', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'was', 'really', 'painful', 'see', 'especially', 'possiblity', 'long-term', 'friendship', 'might', 'end', 'clash', 'personal', 'business', 'philosophies', 'was', 'starkly', 'revealed', 'cameras', 'Kaleil', 'confident', 'brash', 'Tom', 'more', 'laid', 'back', 'capable', 'quiet', 'way', 'work', 'frenetic', 'pace', 'cell', 'phones', 'sprouting', 'heads', 'never', 'sleeping', 'never', 'eating', 'right', 'wonder', 'did', 'not', 'collapse.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'known', 'little', 'more', 'backgrounds', 'main', 'players', 'drama', '.what', 'had', 'done', 'college', 'family', 'dynamics', 'so']",N/A

I mean, out of the gazillions of dot coms with exactly the same story to tell as govworks.com (a couple of moderately-bright and over-ambitious young guys with a lukewarm idea hit up their family and friends up for money, get a round of financing, and fall on their faces as soon as it's clear that the whole thing was rushed into and had a flimsy foundation), it is a shame that this movie followed the travels of the two ... in charge.  Furthermore, this documentary somehow took footage from a spot on the front line of one of the most bombastic, hectic, and electrifying times in this nation's economy, and distilled it into a drab and boring story.  Trust me, this felt every bit like a documentary (you know, the bad kind- the kind which every good documentary clearly distances itself from).Kaleil Isaza Tuzman was OK but had too big of an ego (he'd make a better cheerleader than businessman, use of corporate buzzwords and catchphrases notwithstanding), Tom Herman was a creep with a wet-blanket liberal  personality, and the prevailing quality that comes to mind for everyone involved in the project is ""spoiled.""

666504,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,B00005N5QV,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[45, 53]","Startup.com is one of the best 2001 films now available on DVD. It is a documentary and about the trials and tribulations of a start up internet company but it also  a Heart-wrenching, emotionally involving story about hopes, dreams and friendships.We watch as a group of friends begin their company (in May of 1999) and in less than 2 years are running a 50 million-dollar corporation employing over 250 people (Govworks.com). And then it all begins to fall apart&#65533; rapidly.  We watch as CEO  Kaleil Isaza Tuzman and to a slightly lesser extent Tom Herman become famous via business magazine covers, columns, articles, television news programs, CNN interviews, and even a meeting with a President in which Kaleil suggests the President Clinton  consider working for his company when his presidential term is over.  It's all here and it really happened.The film-makers shot for over two years and were editing the more than 400 hours of video/film right up to their Sundance premiere in early 2001 and re-edited the last few minutes of the film just prior to it's theatrical release in May of 2001.Jehane Noujaim started the film. Noujaim became Kaleil Tuzman Harvard roommate and they remained good friends.  After quitting her job at MTV with plans to go to her homeland Egypt to make a film Noujaim instead began filming Tuzman as he quit his job to begin this company with his old high school chum and a small circle of friends.  She contacted Chris Hegedus and D.A. Pennebaker  for help in financing the project.  They were excited about the idea and Hegedus enthusiastically became a partner in the project.  Hedges and her husband, D.A. Pennebaker  made the excellent  Moon over Broadway (about Carol Burnett's return to Broadway) and The War Room (behind the scenes of Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign) in recent years. Pennebaker is the legendary documentary filmmaker who made the famous film about Bob Dylan,  Don't Look Back and Monterrey Pop.  Pennebaker produced the film and Hegedus and Noujaim  co-directed it.The filmmakers have access to some remarkable private moments, some confidential private meetings and some very special events (like Bill Clinton and in another scene with a speech from former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson.).  At times the film doesn't take quite enough time to explain some of the inner-workings of financing the company  and we don't spend quite enough time on the problems and development of the software itself--but to do so would have meant slowing the movie down and focusing it more on the business and less on the people involved.  Every once in a while you can be confused with what is going or why&#65533; but, life doesn't stop and explain itself to you as well as it should either.  If it's a flaw, it's one that is easy to over-look.I wish the filmmakers did include a little more footage of the special relationship Tom Herman had with some of his co-workers.  He was the one who insisted on  hiring women in the company and he had a much warmer management style which we don't see much of in the film.There's some moments in the film, particularly at the end, where the film-makers deliver just the right balance of verite' and crossing over the line a bit for the sake of some much needed humor.  I don't want to spoil a few moments by saying more than that, but there are several subtle pay-offs, which occur during the film's final moments, which end the film on a very human and ironic note.  This is a film about a lot more than the rise and fall of a dot com company.The film was shot on digital video and is present in the original perspective it was shot in Standard 1:33:1.  The picture is sharp and clear and free from any technical problems whatsoever but it is documentary film-making on the fly and cinema verite'.The Audio is a strong Dolby 5.1 mix The sound quality varies slightly because of the manner in which the film was shot and the sound originally recorded.  However we can clearly hear all of the important dialogue and at times, when the film gets very quiet, we are aware how free from defects the audio actually is.The too short interview with the documentary filmmakers gives a face to the filmmakers.  Some of the information they talk about on-camera is repeated during their feature audio commentary.  The very thorough production notes are appreciated.  It is a real shame however that not all of the pre-release extras that were announced by Artisan several months ago are on the disc.  Extra footage, and commentary from Kaleil and Tom would be a huge asset to the DVD package and I can only assume there were last minute problems that meant the plans to include such commentary had to be scrapped.The feature length commentary track starts out by covering the same ground as the short interview featurette but after 30 minutes we start learning some interesting details and getting some insights into things we are not seeing on the screen.  We learn some interesting information and even about a tragedy that occurred to one of the people we see during the film.  It's well worth the time to listen to the commentary but it can't top one of my favorite commentaries of all time  (the one on Moon Over Broadway).Christopher Jarmick,is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

666506,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,B00005N5QV,darragh o'donoghue,"[13, 18]","After an abrupt start, 'startup.com' is quite an entertaining documentary about two high-school friends, Tom and Kaleil, setting up an internet company, but its pleasures are almost entirely negative.  it's refreshing to see the bright, shiny multi-million hype of the internet industry filmed in cheap, grainy digital.  it is good to see loudly over-ambitious entrepreneurs stabbing themselves in the back as great projects go horribly wrong.  It's fascinating, in a kind of scientific experiment Zola would have been proud of, to see the relationship between two long-time friends put into the incubator of commerce and slowly disintegrate.  For someone completely alien to this world, it is instructive to see how business operates, and, more precisely, the limits you can reach with youth, hype and intelligence - the success of increasing amounts of bogus motiveation needed as things unravel is telling.  And it is always refreshing to see the machinations of not particularly sympathetic, but articulate and bright young men.This is a film about a new subject that tells a very old American story about the promise of hope and fortune emerging from little or nothing.  These guys just need to talk and they seem to sprout money.  these pioneers try to connect with another American story, that of Thoreau, the Romantics and nature - there is an exquisitely embarrassing sequence when Tom takes their staff to his country home and encourages them to listen to the trees.It is always intriguing to see the personal stories behind the public news, in this case the rise and fall of the internet boom; and there is some marvellous footage of Kaleil meeting with President Clinton and offering him his card.Nevertheless, the film has its flaws.  For me, there is the perennial issue of credibility in these documentaries - would these people really be so suicidallly honest in front of a camera, no matter how familiar the people behind it, especially in moments of crisis?  There is also a lack of faith in the Direct Cinema fly-on-the-wall method (the film, produced by the great DA Pennebecker, places itself in a contentious tradition of the documentary), with the imposing of symbolic vignettes (e.g. Tom fixing his daughter's plaits to get both sides even, prologue to a story about two friends going off-kilter), or the biased structuring (Tom is a family man, his soul is saved; Kaleil is so egomaniacally obsessed with the business, his relationships lapse, and his gestures of religion seem insincere).My main problem is with the digital film-making - this, rather like the Internet, once promised greater freedom for film-makers in its cheapness, accessibility and portability, but the framing in this film is often heavy and intrusive.  Further, the increasing indifference among film-makers to the texture and form of the image, their faith in flat, monotonous, murky shots, only obscures stories and can become dull.  If directors cannot bring the visual wit of a Vinterberg or Figgis to digital, than maybe its eminence will be less assured than was once promised.",3,A murky look at a bright new world.,1002844800,"10 12, 2001",2001,3081,"['abrupt', 'start', ""'startup.com"", 'quite', 'entertaining', 'documentary', 'two', 'high-school', 'friends', 'Tom', 'Kaleil', 'setting', 'up', 'internet', 'company', 'pleasures', 'are', 'almost', 'entirely', 'negative', 'refreshing', 'see', 'bright', 'shiny', 'multi-million', 'hype', 'internet', 'industry', 'filmed', 'cheap', 'grainy', 'digital', 'good', 'see', 'loudly', 'over-ambitious', 'entrepreneurs', 'stabbing', 'back', 'great', 'projects', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'fascinating', 'kind', 'scientific', 'experiment', 'Zola', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'proud', 'see', 'relationship', 'two', 'long-time', 'friends', 'put', 'incubator', 'commerce', 'slowly', 'disintegrate', 'someone', 'completely', 'alien', 'world', 'instructive', 'see', 'how', 'business', 'more', 'precisely', 'limits', 'can', 'reach', 'youth', 'hype', 'intelligence', 'success', 'increasing', 'amounts', 'bogus', 'motiveation', 'needed', 'things', 'unravel', 'telling', 'always', 'refreshing', 'see', 'machinations', 'not', 'particularly', 'sympathetic', 'articulate', 'bright', 'young', 'men.This', 'film', 'new', 'subject', 'very', 'old', 'American', 'story', 'promise', 'hope', 'fortune', 'emerging', 'little', 'nothing', 'guys', 'just', 'need', 'talk', 'seem', 'sprout', 'money', 'pioneers', 'try', 'connect', 'American', 'story', 'Thoreau', 'Romantics', 'nature', 'exquisitely', 'embarrassing', 'sequence', 'when', 'Tom', 'staff', 'country', 'home', 'listen', 'trees.It', 'always', 'intriguing', 'see', 'personal', 'stories', 'public', 'news', 'case', 'rise', 'fall', 'internet', 'boom', 'marvellous', 'footage', 'Kaleil', 'meeting', 'President', 'Clinton', 'offering', 'card.Nevertheless', 'film', 'flaws', 'perennial', 'issue', 'credibility', 'documentaries', 'would', 'people', 'really', 'be', 'so', 'suicidallly', 'honest', 'front', 'camera', 'matter', 'how', 'familiar', 'people', 'especially', 'moments', 'crisis', 'also', 'lack', 'faith', 'Direct', 'Cinema', 'fly-on-the-wall', 'method', 'film', 'produced', 'great', 'DA', 'Pennebecker', 'contentious', 'tradition', 'documentary', 'imposing', 'symbolic', 'vignettes', 'e.g', 'Tom', 'fixing', 'daughter', 'plaits', 'get', 'sides', 'even', 'prologue', 'story', 'two', 'friends', 'going', 'off-kilter', 'biased', 'structuring', 'Tom', 'family', 'man', 'soul', 'saved', 'Kaleil', 'so', 'egomaniacally', 'obsessed', 'business', 'relationships', 'lapse', 'gestures', 'religion', 'seem', 'insincere', '.My', 'main', 'problem', 'digital', 'film-making', 'rather', 'Internet', 'once', 'promised', 'greater', 'freedom', 'film-makers', 'cheapness', 'accessibility', 'portability', 'framing', 'film', 'often', 'heavy', 'intrusive', 'Further', 'increasing', 'indifference', 'film-makers', 'texture', 'form', 'image', 'faith', 'flat', 'monotonous', 'murky', 'shots', 'only', 'stories', 'can', 'become', 'dull', 'directors', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'visual', 'wit', 'Vinterberg', 'Figgis', 'digital', 'maybe', 'eminence', 'will', 'be', 'less', 'assured', 'was', 'once', 'promised']",N/A

Alas, it is also akin to political democracy in that it is unnerving and somewhat yucky to closely observe the actual sausage making process. This documentary is a must see for anybody desiring to further comprehend the recent dot.com economic debacle. Long time chums Kaleil Isaza Tuzman and Tom Herman become partners hoping &quot;to eliminate frustration in the public sector.&quot; The GovWorks website encourages citizens to interact financially with their government agencies. One could pay traffic tickets or taxes, and even bid on seized property among a myriad of other possibilities. We get to observe the adventure of this start up until it closes down less than two years later. This business model is a certain winner in the long run. Unfortunately, as Lord Keynes once sardonically remarked, we are all dead in the long run. The free market generally rewards only those successful in a shorter time frame. Much is made of the so called first mover advantage. Conveniently overlooked, however, is the cold fact that the second movers are often able to take advantage of the mistakes committed by the pioneers. Tuzman and Herman soon learn that attempting to hit the proverbial home run also significantly increases the odds of striking out.Our under thirty years of age duo bravely endure the long hours and never ending obstacles threatening their dream. They initially agree to share the power until realizing that this management structure is doomed to fail. The resulting crisis inevitably tests their friendship to the breaking point. Tuzman is something of a lightning rod for abuse and criticism. He makes enemies with relative ease. Is this merely the price of leadership, or does Tuzman possess a damaging character flaw? I suspect the former, but concede that my opinion is highly debatable.Many people gleefully gloat that Tuzman and Herman deserved their comeuppance. I believe that a fair-minded viewer of &quot;Startup.com&quot; will instead credit these two gentlemen with the courage and perhaps foolhardiness to reach for the stars. After all, we are ultimately the beneficiaries of their risk taking and creativity. The film makers should have added another fifteen-twenty minutes to flesh out the rise and fall of GovWorks. This is especially true with their flippant handling of the scene wherein Tuzman is talking to President Bill Clinton. Sitting next to Tuzman is Robert Putnam of &quot;Bowling Alone&quot; fame who was one ofTuzman's Harvard University professors. Coincidentally, it should be added is that Putnam is a specialist in facilitating improved relationships between governments and the common folk. Isn't it therefore reasonable to suppose that Putnam had at least something to do with the very conceptualization of the GovWorks idea? This movie earns four stars. It could have been better, but the finished product still deserves a large audience.

The only artistic aspect is some nifty editing (e.g. she says to camera that she wants to settle down with Kaleil and get a dog; he says to the telephone, almost immediately afterwards, but in a different venue, that he hates the idea of having either a dog or a baby.) This film is not going to win any prizes for cinematography.But what you do get is a fantastically instructive series of lessons in how to start up a business. Ultimately these guys fail, but along the way, you get a lot of lessons in what venture capitalists were looking for, how to attract talent and funding when you seem to have nothing but enthusiasm to offer, how to handle competitors and how to cope with long-term friends in your firm.This is the DVD you need to watch every time you're thinking of starting up a business, or thinking of going into business with a friend. Not necessarily to put you off, but at least to warn you of some of the dangers.Of course, there is a very different VC climate nowadays, since the dot-com bust, and I would imagine that even then, some of the US practices seen here would not be transferable to the UK without some modification. In this film, it is startling to see a small group of twentysomethings flying between the East Coast and Silicon Valley, casually talking about getting their first $15 million of funding when they have no customers and no product. One of the original founders gets out very early -- it seems for $700K in cash -- and it looks likely, he is the only one who makes anything out of this venture, called govWorks.com. (By the way, the film ends with the caption that the firm was bought by a multinational, but that Web address does not seem to work now. Although bizarrely the fictitious Web address implied by the start.com title DOES exist!)So, every would-be MBA graduate ought to watch this movie.

Set against the backdrop of the dot com bubble burst, what I loved about this movie is that it is basically a story of two guys with a solid friendship. I can't blame them for starting a business on a dream. Everyone was doing the same thing in the late 90's. I don't blame them for the business failing. Most of these ventures failed. During the rise and fall of the company there is a lot of drama between the two founders of the company. They have been friends since kids and the failing business almost tears their friendship apart. In the end I got a great sense of hope that there is more to life than just making profits and that true friends can get through anything and come out on top at the end. I think too many people go into this movie wanting to know all the details about why the business failed and what went wrong. A lot of people have bashed this movie because it focuses on the relationships of the players but that is the same quality of this movie that endears it to me. Money comes and goes.

666518,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00005N5QV,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[25, 25]","""Startup.com"" is a fascinating, but slightly flawed documentary following the lives of several men who founded a dot-com in 1998. (Work leading to its creation had started months earlier, but wasn't included in the documentary.)  The principal dot-com founders were Kaleil Isaza Tuzman, Tom Herman and Chieh Cheung.  Kaleil and Tom were high school friends.  Shortly after the company's official launch, Chieh's involvement was terminated after Kaleil and Tom decided to buy him out.  They believed Chieh wasn't doing enough, in spite of Chieh's time, work and money invested prior to the company's official launch.For the most part, the first third of documentary is devoted to Kaleil's efforts to obtain venture capitalist (VC) investment into the new company.  The combination of his efforts and unbridled VC risk-taking of the 1990's succeeded in Kaleil securing $50-million in VC investment.  At the company's launch, it had eight employees.  After several months of hard work and the hiring of a lot more staff, the company's website was finally launched. Within about a year, the company's total employment exceeded 200 employees, but the joy didn't last long.  Personality conflicts between Kaleil and Tom lead to some unpleasant consequences.  Also, like most of the dot-com's created in the 1990's, the amount of money earned through the company's website paled in comparison to the amount of invested capital and the money squandered by the company.Sadly, the creators of this documentary (Chris Hegedus and Jehane Noujaim) focused far too much on Kaleil, not enough on Tom and very little on Chieh.  The quality of the documentary would have been far better had more time been devoted to Tom throughout the film, and more to Chieh at the beginning (prior to the company's launch).  No narration was provided in the documentary.  Instead, it was shot much like a reality television show using small hand-held cameras, but occasional subtitles provide the viewer with time references and employee counts.  Highlights in the documentary include an actual CNBC interview with Kaleil (when the company was worth $50-million with venture capital) and his brief meeting with then U.S. President Bill Clinton.The real value of this documentary is fourfold:(1) The eagerness of 1990's venture capitalists to willingly invest millions of dollars into companies with unsubstantiated and exaggerated business plans.(2) The squandering by dot-com's of millions of invested dollars(3) The strain put on long-term friendships when money and cutthroat business practices get involved.(4) Seeing some of the faces and narcissistic egos behind dot-coms.For these reasons, I rate this documentary with 4 out of 5 stars. I highly recommend it to any former or current dot-com employee, to anyone that invested and subsequently lost money in a dot-com or to anyone that wants to form his/her own company.",4,How Not to Run A Business,1046044800,"02 24, 2003",2003,2895,"['Startup.com', 'fascinating', 'slightly', 'flawed', 'documentary', 'following', 'lives', 'several', 'men', 'who', 'founded', 'dot-com', '1998', 'Work', 'leading', 'creation', 'had', 'started', 'months', 'earlier', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'documentary', 'principal', 'dot-com', 'founders', 'were', 'Kaleil', 'Isaza', 'Tuzman', 'Tom', 'Herman', 'Chieh', 'Cheung', 'Kaleil', 'Tom', 'were', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'Shortly', 'company', 'official', 'launch', 'Chieh', 'involvement', 'was', 'terminated', 'Kaleil', 'Tom', 'decided', 'buy', 'out', 'believed', 'Chieh', 'was', ""n't"", 'doing', 'enough', 'spite', 'Chieh', 'time', 'work', 'money', 'invested', 'prior', 'company', 'official', 'launch.For', 'most', 'part', 'first', 'third', 'documentary', 'devoted', 'Kaleil', 'efforts', 'obtain', 'venture', 'capitalist', 'VC', 'investment', 'new', 'company', 'combination', 'efforts', 'unbridled', 'VC', 'risk-taking', '1990', 'succeeded', 'Kaleil', 'securing', '50-million', 'VC', 'investment', 'company', 'launch', 'had', 'eight', 'employees', 'several', 'months', 'hard', 'work', 'hiring', 'lot', 'more', 'staff', 'company', 'website', 'was', 'finally', 'launched', 'year', 'company', 'total', 'employment', 'exceeded', '200', 'employees', 'joy', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'Personality', 'conflicts', 'Kaleil', 'Tom', 'lead', 'unpleasant', 'consequences', 'Also', 'most', 'dot-com', 'created', '1990', 'amount', 'money', 'earned', 'company', 'website', 'paled', 'comparison', 'amount', 'invested', 'capital', 'money', 'squandered', 'company.Sadly', 'creators', 'documentary', 'Chris', 'Hegedus', 'Jehane', 'Noujaim', 'focused', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'Kaleil', 'not', 'enough', 'Tom', 'very', 'little', 'Chieh', 'quality', 'documentary', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'better', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'been', 'devoted', 'Tom', 'film', 'more', 'Chieh', 'beginning', 'prior', 'company', 'launch', 'narration', 'was', 'provided', 'documentary', 'Instead', 'was', 'shot', 'much', 'reality', 'television', 'show', 'using', 'small', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'occasional', 'subtitles', 'provide', 'viewer', 'time', 'references', 'employee', 'counts', 'Highlights', 'documentary', 'include', 'actual', 'CNBC', 'interview', 'Kaleil', 'when', 'company', 'was', 'worth', '50-million', 'venture', 'capital', 'brief', 'meeting', 'then', 'U.S.', 'President', 'Bill', 'Clinton.The', 'real', 'value', 'documentary', 'fourfold', '1', 'eagerness', '1990', 'venture', 'capitalists', 'willingly', 'invest', 'millions', 'dollars', 'companies', 'unsubstantiated', 'exaggerated', 'business', 'plans', '2', 'squandering', 'dot-com', 'millions', 'invested', 'dollars', '3', 'strain', 'put', 'long-term', 'friendships', 'when', 'money', 'cutthroat', 'business', 'practices', 'get', 'involved', '4', 'Seeing', 'narcissistic', 'egos', 'dot-coms.For', 'reasons', 'rate', 'documentary', '4', '5', 'stars', 'highly', 'recommend', 'former', 'current', 'dot-com', 'employee', 'anyone', 'invested', 'subsequently', 'lost', 'money', 'dot-com', 'anyone', 'form', 'own', 'company']",N/A

If you feel good about yourself, you will achieve more.  Yet if you compare academic achievement, students in countries such as Korea where the students were more likely to not consider themselves bright, considering themselves not to have above average skills in mathmatics scored much higher than students in countries like the U.S. where they indicated great self-confidence in their intelligence.This is the opposite of when the U.S. students would have been on top in achievement in less-psychologized days.The documentary starts out with Kaleil(?) and Tom buying out a third founder who is not going forward in quitting his job and dedicating fully to their new business.  This guy plays Kaleil and Tom like marionettes and they buy him out for $700,000(?) before the thing is really even started.At this point, we see our first glaring indication of what psychologized men they are, Kaleil and Tom comfort each other about how it hurt each other more ""emotionally"" than the money itself.In the film, Tom is definitely the one who has bought into modern psychological thought the most.  He places importance on creating good feelings, creating company social occasions, and positive work environments.  He even focuses on little company ""camping"" events where his father plays a guitar and has sing-a-long songs.  Meanwhile, Tom isn't that great of a programmer and the documentarians fail to show how he leads a programming team.  However, we do later see, it was not done successfully as GovWorks software was incompentently made and has very obvious problems while nearing production status that shouldn't have gotten past the beginning stages of development.Kaleil does seem to have a lot of organizational, business skills getting investors interested (although the absurdly unrealistically optimistic internet enthusiasm made it possible where normally he probably couldn't have) and putting together various business deals.  Unfortunately, Kaleil himself does focus on organizing company ""Rah Rah"" sessions as well as motivational-speaker-type events.Meanwhile Tom and the programmers have developed a horrendously faulty system that Kaleil rightfully declares he can not release into the market despite its emminent deadline.Then business reality finally starts to take force and Tom is forced out of the company.  Now Tom and Kaleil fight and then hug and nurture each other going through this struggle.Now, we have a competitor breaking the market with what seems to be a competent product and the end of GovWorks quickens.There is a lot of things I was interested in about this movie.#1) Entrepenuerial effort even though failed.#2) A study on the farce of psychological thought being an asset while in reality being quite destructive.#3) True dramatic interactions between close friends during different situations and struggles.  Even if they are sappy psychobabblers who made their own problems.The potential of their plan was incredible and legitimate.  These guys could have made in the hundreds of millions each if they implemented their ideas correctly.  It was a time that won't happen again in the foreseeable future.#1) A legitimately new and lucrative market waiting to be exploited.#2) Investors throwing money around at anything ""internet"".In honesty, with a little LESS confidence, LESS believing in themselves and an extreme dedicated focus on perfecting the product, they probably could have made it.",5,It'll be the last time street punks

The movie begins with the two friends, along with some business partners, brainstorming over what to call the business and then going out to venture capitalists to raise the funds...tens of millions of dollars.  Early on, the ask a &quot;man on the street&quot; what he thinks of the name of their web site.  He declares he doesn't like it...doesn't trust the government.  An early potential investor tells them they're three years too late with their idea and that it will fail.  These words turn out to be prophetic...but these guys are mostly amused and laugh the criticism off.Tuzman is the focal point of the movie.  His is an ego run rampant.  We see him scheming...this is a real, live type-A internet tycoon.  His temper flairs, he's foul-mouthed, he's full of himself.  But he can be convincing and charming too.  Tom, his oldest, dearest friend, is very soft-spoken in comparison, and the two occasionally fight...and occasionally hug in reconciliation.The raise a bunch of money and really start living high on the hog.  But when things go downhill, Tuzman turns on Tom and the disintegration of the company and relationship is luridly fascinating.  We'd like to turn away, because what we see is real...but we can't.  These guys are getting thier comeuppance...and that's fun to see.  But we've also learned to empathize with them...to hope that THIS TIME the story won't turn out the way you know it will.The movie is fun.  The filmmakers were SO lucky to get this kind of access at this point in internet history.  A few years earlier and maybe govworks might have made it, and then the story wouldn't have been interesting.  A few months later, and there would have been no funding and thus no story to tell.Some viewers who aren't very familiar with venture capital and such might get lost at a few points in the film, BUT, you can certainly understand what's going on by the roller-coaster of emotions these guys are going through.  There's no narration to tell you what, factually, is happening...we see it all through the conversations of these guys we're following.  Powerful stuff and worth putting up with the only occasionally esoteric financial details.It's interesting that we never get a really clear idea of how govworks.com is supposed to work...I suspect these guys didn't really either.  It was a time when just opening up on the web could yield millions.  The business model would take care of itself...so they thought.  So, ultimately, startup.com is a cautionary tale.

Watching their strains, their accomplishments, and their hubris is fascinating.On the other hand, we do not get much of the crucial but less photogenic backstory.  We don't know much about what these guys were doing before they started the company.  We don't see much of their interaction with the venture capitalists who funded them or the board that apparently was near the point of firing them.  We see that there was a suspicious break-in to their offices, but there is no follow-up in the documentary about whether the police ever found the culprit, what the missing documents were, and why the documents were so important.  We see more of their discussions about raising money and less of the conversations about what features they would include on the web site, how they decided on its design, and so forth.  We never are told what the business model for the company was.  How specifically did they expect to make a profit, and what did they fail to anticipate that prevented them from doing so?  (Did they have too few customers?  Could they not get enough cities to participate?)  Perhaps they had no clear path to profitability, but that is something we should know.  Finally, we see Bryan R. Mundy, the CEO of competitor ezgov.com, visiting govwork.com's headquarters, and we later hear Kaleil complain that govwork.com's competitors (including, I assume, ezgov.com) are doing much better.  How did these other companies make a go of it?  What did they do that govworks.com failed to do?  (For those who are curious, ezgov.com is still in business, but Mr. Mundy died in a fire in his house in January 2001.)  These are the sorts of details that a good Wall Street Journal feature or a John McPhee profile would have included.See the film if you are interested in the personalities and lives of two hi-tech entrepeneurs as they take flight and then crash and burn.

666528,ABKAPN87T5G80,B00005N5QV,Twain,"[11, 14]","This movie is basically about one thing: a young, wildly arrogant and immature businessman named Kaleil Izaza Tuzman, and how foolish everyone was for believing in him for even a split second. He is such an amateur, such a pompous fool, that the whole documentary takes on the feel of a practical joke as we watch bankers, co-workers, and at least one woman get sucked into this clown's semi-fabulous dot.com world. There is a certain satisfaction as we watch the movie and watch what was truly a house of cards come tumbling down on this poor ass.To a somewhat lesser extent, the movie also follows his partner Tom, who is a bit more subtle and reflective than Kaleil, but equally ignorant about what they are actually doing. But in telling Tom's story, the film makes some serious mistakes and omissions. He kind of jumps on the scene and it is hard to understand where he is from both literally and in a broader sense.Overall the one thing to take away from this movie is just how amazingly stupid people were in the late 1990s. Kaleil and Tom ran one of the most worthless businesses I have ever heard of (although hindsight is perfect after all) and managed to get 50 million dollars and hire 250 people. It's really mind-blowing. It is also surprising and disturbing that Kaleil was hired by Goldman Sachs. The fact that anyone hired this doofus at all, let alone the investment banking department of Goldman Sachs, is disgraceful. I mean, this is a guy who's invited to be on CNN and he shows up wearing gold chains. It is really amazing that nowhere in his journey did anyone just pull him aside and tell him, ""Kaleil, you have got to ditch the french cuffs and for God's sake, slow down when you talk to people, and get a decent haircut and decent clothes. You look like you got pulled off the beach at Atlantic city."" I mean, you want to scream at him throughout the movie. I know this is a superficial criticism, but it is quite apt I think, as his dubious style and demeanor proves to be an accurate reflection of his abilities as a businessman: he's all flash and no substance. In fact, in the end, he seals his own fate as an absolute zero when he forgets to check the code the night before his site goes up! It doesnt take much to realize that the reality of the situation is that for all their audacity, both Kaleil and Tom are actually pretty sloppy, bad and immature communicators, and of questionable intelligence. Really.  In fact, all they really have is ambition.I guess that is a statement of sorts in itself; arguably, the failure of the insipidly named ""govworks"" illustrates that just maybe substance does count for something after all.
