They made two studio LPs, those having the advantage of studio overdubbing and the usual tricks.  They made a double-live LP.  They played very little together, actually, because it's rare a stage is large enough to accommodate more than one of their egos at a time.Two studio LPS and a double-live in 30-40 years, and they've been sitting on that.  And this shows the weaknesses -- the holes in their harmonies, etc. -- of their live performances.The same mega-hype applies to ""Buffalo Springfield"".  They made -- what? -- two LPs, and the second was mostly tracks left over from the first.  And yet one would think they'd produced a brilliant LP per year for 40 years.  I recall ""seeing"" ""Buffalo Springfiled"" in 1967: they came out on stage, spent some 10 minutes tuning up, then left the stage.

822196,A3ORIPRRULK20G,B00023B1A8,"Leonard Skinnard ""Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown""","[21, 39]","Knowing the street date was June 9th, I stopped off at Best Buy, they didn't have it, but that's not surprising, they didn't have Cat Stevens two weeks earlier. I then went to the local record store and there sat one copy each of CSN &quot;Acoustic&quot; and &quot;Daylight&quot; again. I now own about 100 Concert DVD's, all are classic rock, two weeks earlier I picked up Cat Stevens &quot;Majikat&quot; from 1976, Doobie Bros &quot;Rockin' Down the Highway&quot; from 1996 and Simon &amp; Garfunkel at Central Park from 1981. One of my first DVD purchases about two years ago was a Supertramp show from 1983 and I've been turned off on buying older shows ever since, normally looking for newer concerts because of the audio and video. However recently I picked up the Doors Collection and the 1968 L.A. show that's included is pretty good so I've expanded my horizon. If your a fan of Cat Stevens, his new DVD will blow you away, even though I've held a grudge for his changes in lifestyle and religion it was easy to forget all that. Now, two weeks later I'm sitting down to watch CSN Acoustic &amp; Daylight Again. I start off with the older 1983 Daylight again. I've been a fan since 1969 but have never seen them in person, I own the Woodstock DVD, and I can remember wearing out the Deja Vu record while stationed overseas in 1970-'71 and later the Four Way Street album. First off, the DVD audio and video are excellent, as good as any current DVD recordings. The concert was pretty much as I expected, a good backup band, a mix of old and newer songs, some acoustic, some electric and some with Graham on piano. I didn't know Graham Nash played guitar, it's interesting when they open and you see three guitars standing side-by-side. I would recommend buying this DVD, giving it 4 out of 5 stars. The second DVD, &quot;Acoustic&quot; recorded 1991, I'll probably rewatch more because it includes more of the songs I like. Stephen Stills is plugged in quite a bit of the time, so the main difference is there are no drums or keyboard backup, however CSN is good either way. The audiences on both concert DVD's are really into the band, but on the &quot;Acoustic&quot; DVD the San Franciscan crowd is a bigger part of the event, probably because it's a little smaller venue and the band invites them to be more vocal. Even though it's billed as acoustic, it's an energetic show, I would give &quot;Acoustic&quot; 4-1/2 stars.

Perhaps those interested in Uncle Tupelo or Wilco or Jay Farrar will want to know where it all came from, but in any case, unless you're over 40, you just aren't going to get it. That's OK. I'd rather you didn't.For the rest of us, this is a warm, engaging concert propelled by an extraordinarily healthy David Crosby. Crosby was the heart, soul and brains of this outfit, thecreative fire as well as the wizened seer. His inner strength shines through and while Nash and Stills have seen better days as singers and musicians, Crosby continues to age like the most powerful and protean force the world of music has ever known. He hits his marks and covers for both ends of his partners with a voice that is a gift and that has gathered a strength, scope and power with age and experience. No one sings like David Crosby. Inspite of being the one from Southern California, Crosby is the erudite, urbane, witty and philosophically politicized member of the group. He has an incisive mind that comes through in his lyrics, the subtlety of his chord changes. He still writes songs that matter, and his current group, CPR, is every bit the match of this venerable lineup.But as to the matter at hand, this is a wonderful concert in which each of them performs with a passionate commitment to their music. As many times as I've heard these songs, I love the renditions here. The showis beautifully shot and the Dolby 5.1 sound recreates an incredible acoustic experience. Stills was particulalrly on for the show. His voice has deteriorated the most, but his guitar playing throughout was a model of taste, restraint and finesse. That's quite an accomplishment for Stephen, considering hispenchant for sloppy excess. Nash is still the barefoot lightweight, and he seriously misses the first few harmonies on the opening Deja Vu before adjusting his regester and hitting the mark thereafter. The overbearing ""Cathedral"" is not as melodramatic as it typically is and ""Marrakesh Express"" is reworked, reset perfectly. Unfortunately most of his heartfelt stuff comes off as trite, redeemed solely as an excuse to showcase Crosby's incredible talent for infusing the most banal with meaning by force of delivery. Crosby, as I say, is the wheel here.By this point, they were in the sunset of their careers. Only Crosby and the Canadian Odd-ball have managed to remain relevant in a shifting musical and political world. Here, they glow in the light of all they managed to surmount and survive. Their best stuff still matters, and reminds you that there was once a point to singing.",4,Terrific Concert Capturing the Sunset of their career,1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,2742,"['need', 'be', 'bit', 'nostalgic', 'hippie', 'music', 'definite', 'time', 'hip', 'hop', 'beastie-kid-boyband-covertrash', 'metal', 'punks', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'get', 'Perhaps', 'interested', 'Uncle', 'Tupelo', 'Wilco', 'Jay', 'Farrar', 'will', 'want', 'know', 'where', 'came', 'case', ""'re"", '40', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'get', 'OK', ""'d"", 'rather', ""didn't.For"", 'rest', 'warm', 'engaging', 'concert', 'propelled', 'extraordinarily', 'healthy', 'David', 'Crosby', 'Crosby', 'was', 'heart', 'soul', 'brains', 'outfit', 'thecreative', 'fire', 'as', 'well', 'wizened', 'seer', 'inner', 'strength', 'shines', 'Nash', 'Stills', 'have', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'singers', 'musicians', 'Crosby', 'age', 'most', 'powerful', 'protean', 'force', 'world', 'music', 'ever', 'known', 'marks', 'covers', 'ends', 'partners', 'voice', 'gift', 'gathered', 'strength', 'scope', 'power', 'age', 'experience', 'one', 'sings', 'David', 'Crosby', 'Inspite', 'being', 'one', 'Southern', 'California', 'Crosby', 'erudite', 'urbane', 'witty', 'philosophically', 'politicized', 'member', 'group', 'incisive', 'mind', 'through', 'lyrics', 'subtlety', 'chord', 'changes', 'still', 'songs', 'matter', 'current', 'group', 'CPR', 'bit', 'match', 'venerable', 'lineup.But', 'matter', 'hand', 'wonderful', 'concert', 'performs', 'passionate', 'commitment', 'music', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'songs', 'love', 'renditions', 'here', 'showis', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'sound', 'incredible', 'acoustic', 'experience', 'Stills', 'was', 'particulalrly', 'show', 'voice', 'deteriorated', 'most', 'guitar', 'playing', 'was', 'model', 'taste', 'restraint', 'finesse', 'quite', 'accomplishment', 'Stephen', 'considering', 'hispenchant', 'sloppy', 'excess', 'Nash', 'still', 'barefoot', 'lightweight', 'seriously', 'first', 'few', 'harmonies', 'opening', 'Deja', 'Vu', 'adjusting', 'regester', 'hitting', 'mark', 'thereafter', 'overbearing', 'Cathedral', 'not', 'as', 'melodramatic', 'typically', 'Marrakesh', 'Express', 'reworked', 'reset', 'perfectly', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'heartfelt', 'stuff', 'off', 'trite', 'redeemed', 'solely', 'excuse', 'showcase', 'Crosby', 'incredible', 'talent', 'infusing', 'most', 'banal', 'meaning', 'force', 'delivery', 'Crosby', 'say', 'wheel', 'here.By', 'point', 'were', 'sunset', 'careers', 'Only', 'Crosby', 'Canadian', 'Odd-ball', 'have', 'managed', 'remain', 'relevant', 'shifting', 'musical', 'political', 'world', 'Here', 'glow', 'light', 'managed', 'surmount', 'survive', 'best', 'stuff', 'still', 'matters', 'was', 'once', 'point', 'singing']",N/A

Among the tunes included on the set list are Our House, Deja Vu, Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, Teach Your Children and many more. Over 80 minutes of acoustic bliss.From Woodstock to the present day, Crosby Stills and Nash have always been included among super group stature. The boys were showing their age but the skills were still sharper than ever. The harmonies were so clear and you could see and feel the emotion from the trio after every song. They thoroughly enjoyed the evening and so did I. This was a reunion to remember.I really enjoyed Still's metallic sound and fantastic solos. When he played his electric guitar on a couple songs he captured the audience and their participation was infectious.This was a stimulating experience. I found my attention riveted to the screen, not wanting to miss a note.For previews of music and videos not available on Amazon, check out Crosby, Stills & Nash's ""The Acoustic Concert"" on You Tube.",5,A Reunion To Remember,1349913600,"10 11, 2012",2012,1112,"['Filmed', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Warfield', 'Theater', 'November', '1991', 'concert', 'legendary', 'Crosby', 'Stills', 'Nash', 'performing', 'acoustic', 'versions', 'best', 'loved', 'songs', 'tunes', 'included', 'set', 'list', 'are', 'House', 'Deja', 'Vu', 'Suite', 'Judy', 'Blue', 'Eyes', 'Teach', 'Children', 'many', 'more', '80', 'minutes', 'acoustic', 'bliss.From', 'Woodstock', 'present', 'day', 'Crosby', 'Stills', 'Nash', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'included', 'super', 'group', 'stature', 'boys', 'were', 'showing', 'age', 'skills', 'were', 'still', 'sharper', 'ever', 'harmonies', 'were', 'so', 'clear', 'could', 'see', 'feel', 'emotion', 'trio', 'song', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'evening', 'so', 'did', 'was', 'reunion', 'remember.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Still', 'metallic', 'sound', 'fantastic', 'solos', 'When', 'played', 'electric', 'guitar', 'couple', 'songs', 'captured', 'audience', 'participation', 'was', 'infectious.This', 'was', 'stimulating', 'experience', 'found', 'attention', 'riveted', 'screen', 'not', 'wanting', 'miss', 'note.For', 'previews', 'music', 'videos', 'not', 'available', 'Amazon', 'check', 'out', 'Crosby', 'Stills', 'Nash', 'Acoustic', 'Concert', 'Tube']",N/A

The harmonies are bang-on, (unlike some live footage of them that's out there,Woodstock maybe, where they waver off key because they can't hear the monitors) This is a blend of their older and newer materialincluding some of their solo efforts. I especially liked Stills' guitar work on 'For What it's Worth' which he turns into an audience participation song.

The song selection was (and is) excellent, ""Acoustic"" is the guys' second name and there was no reason to doubt the audio quality of their exceptional vocal harmonies.Yet, the result is far from satisfactory considering the potential of such concert. Four major drwbacks:1. It is not exactly 'acoustic'; Excluding a couple of songs Stills plays only electric guitar and though in some cases it does fit (Just a song before I go) in others (For what it worth) it's out of place2. The vocal harmonies are lost in an annoying echo created probably by the acoustic structure of the concert hall and not the actual audio editing; still the result - when they get to high pitch - is annoying3. There are some tedious pieces that go on and on and are very boring and don't develop; Mainly ""Wooden ships"" followed by ""Judy blue eys"", each almost 10 minutes of very poor arrangement. They could do much better - and shorter...4. The song sequence is uneven: The opening (Deja Vu) is quite bad, but then it recovers and improves (mainly due to the density of Nash's pieces - see below) and is pretty even until it gets to ""Wooden ships"". The closing part is OK as well, but I assume most people will jog between songsStill, there's one person who stands out and not only because he looks much better than his 2 fat and sweaty colleagues: Graham Nash's pieces are all good and above, especially when he's at the piano, and for those (like myself) who see him as the band's main musical figure - this does makes this DVD - despite the flwas - worth buying.",3,Disappointing...
