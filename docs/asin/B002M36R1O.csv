I have been waiting for the release of these gems for a long time. I am not disappointed in the quality or the content of this release.The introductions by ""of that era actors"" like Jack Klugman are fantastic. The behind the scenes interviews with directors and actors are fascinating. The quality of images are not horrible by any means, and are much better than in previous collections that I have purchased. Five minutes into each show, and you are there, marveling at what an accomplishment these creations really were.As for the content, in many ways it does not get any better than what you will see here. This is the pick of the of the litter. Personally I prefer the ""Marty"" that is in this collection to the filmed version. ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" is superb in every way. ""The Comedian"" is incomparable, and ""Patterns"" sublime.A negative review for this collection is unwarranted in my opinion. These are shows which you will again and again and again return to, because there is simply nothing like them.

In the beginning of television were part motion picture and part theater. Shows like Playhouse 90, US Steal Hour, Four Star Play house, etc filled the airwaves. The stage guild would  help produce  60 to 90 minutes pieces of theater thru the medium of TV.This three disk collection is a piece of American history. These tele-plays was high art on a small scale.  with talented names like Rod Steiger (Marty), Cliff Robertson (The Days of Wine and Roses), Mickey Rooney (The Comedian), Paul Newman (Bank the Drum Slowly) and Andy Griffith (No Time for Sergeants) fill this piece of TV history. What amazes me is these TV plays still hold up sixty years later.This is like a time capture since many of the performers are no longer with us. It is a marvelous feat to watch the shows. The staging, the camera work, the acting is all top notice and at the tip of their games.Originally These eight shows were shown on PBS in 1980's. Thank heaven for the Criterion  collection to allow this collection to come to DVD.If you are a fan of classic tv or just great talent, this is one to get for those who love great television.Bennet PomerantzAUDIOWORLD",5,Classic Television,1353196800,"11 18, 2012",2012,1181,"['1950', 'Television', 'was', 'LIVE', 'beginning', 'television', 'were', 'part', 'motion', 'picture', 'part', 'theater', 'Playhouse', '90', 'US', 'Steal', 'Hour', 'Four', 'Star', 'Play', 'house', 'etc', 'filled', 'airwaves', 'stage', 'guild', 'would', 'help', 'produce', '60', '90', 'minutes', 'pieces', 'theater', 'thru', 'medium', 'TV.This', 'three', 'disk', 'collection', 'piece', 'American', 'history', 'tele-plays', 'was', 'high', 'art', 'small', 'scale', 'talented', 'names', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'Marty', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Days', 'Wine', 'Roses', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Comedian', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Bank', 'Drum', 'Slowly', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'No', 'Time', 'Sergeants', 'fill', 'piece', 'TV', 'history', 'What', 'TV', 'plays', 'still', 'hold', 'up', 'sixty', 'years', 'later.This', 'time', 'capture', 'many', 'performers', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'marvelous', 'feat', 'watch', 'shows', 'staging', 'camera', 'work', 'acting', 'top', 'notice', 'tip', 'games.Originally', 'eight', 'shows', 'were', 'shown', 'PBS', '1980', 'Thank', 'heaven', 'Criterion', 'collection', 'allow', 'collection', 'come', 'DVD.If', 'are', 'fan', 'classic', 'tv', 'just', 'great', 'talent', 'one', 'get', 'who', 'love', 'great', 'television.Bennet', 'PomerantzAUDIOWORLD']",N/A
1277568,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B002M36R1O,calvinnme,"[67, 70]","Early in the days of television, the teleplay was made popular with independent one and two hour segments on shows named after the sponsor, such as ""The U.S. Steel Hour"". These were early showcases of the excellent talents of young writers such as Rod Serling. Because you didn't have to leave your living room to see a fine drama, they had a huge negative impact on the film industry and led to such innovations as making both the color film and the widescreen film common, since these were two things you couldn't get from television. Up to now many of these early teleplays have been shown only in the public domain if at all, because they only existed on kinescope, and then only for the purpose of rebroadcasting to different time zones. The concept of the rerun and syndication had not occurred to producers at the time these were made - with the exception of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. New digital techniques have allowed these early kinescopes to be transferred and viewed with better clarity than ever before, and this new package by Criterion boasts some fine dramas from the 1950's, many of which went on to be made into acclaimed motion pictures.EPISODES:Marty (1953) - The motion picture was a Best Picture Oscar winner in 1955. This version has the role of Marty played by Rod Steiger and the role of the girl with which he connects played by Nancy Marchand. Written by Paddy Chayefsky.Patterns (1955) - Written by Rod Serling. Show starred Richard Kiley as young executive Fred Staples. However, Staples can see his possible distant future in an aging executive (Ed Begley) who is constantly berated and belittled by the boss (Everett Sloane).No Time for Sergeants (1955) - Andy Griffith is cast as Will Stockdale, a backwoods fellow who is drafted into the army.  Harry Clark plays the sergeant that is his nemesis. This play was the basis for the TV Show ""Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C"" which ran from 1964 until 1969.A Wind from the South (1955) - Stars Julie Harris.Requiem for a Heavyweight (1956) - Written by Rod Serling with Jack Palance as the slow-witted mountain of a man who suddenly finds his boxing career over and doesn't know what to do next.Bang the Drum Slowly (1956) - Written by Mark Harris and starring Paul Newman in one of his earliest performances. It's a story of a baseball team that is a thinly disguised version of the New York Yankees whose catcher gets Hodgkin's disease and tries to conceal his ailment.The Comedian ((1957) - Written by Rod Serling and starring Mickey Rooney as a difficult TV comedian who picks on his brother (Mel Torme) and drives one of his gag writers (Edmund O'Brien) to the brink of insanity by his behavior.Days of Wine and Roses (1958) - Cliff Robertson and Piper Laurie are a couple whose lives are ruined by alcoholism.Extra features:Commentaries by directors John Frankenheimer, Delbert Mann, Ralph Nelson, and Daniel PetrieInterviews with key cast and crew, including Frankenheimer, Andy Griffith, Julie Harris, Kim Hunter, Richard Kiley, Piper Laurie, Nancy Marchand, Jack Palance, Cliff Robertson, Mickey Rooney, Carol Serling, Rod Steiger, and Mel TormePLUS: A booklet featuring an essay by curator Ron Simon and his extensive liner notes on each program",5,Fine examples of early television dramas,1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,3224,"['Early', 'days', 'television', 'teleplay', 'was', 'made', 'popular', 'independent', 'one', 'two', 'hour', 'segments', 'shows', 'named', 'sponsor', 'such', 'U.S.', 'Steel', 'Hour', 'were', 'early', 'showcases', 'excellent', 'talents', 'young', 'writers', 'such', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'leave', 'living', 'room', 'see', 'fine', 'drama', 'had', 'huge', 'negative', 'impact', 'film', 'industry', 'led', 'such', 'innovations', 'making', 'color', 'film', 'widescreen', 'film', 'common', 'were', 'two', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'television', 'now', 'many', 'early', 'teleplays', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'only', 'public', 'domain', 'only', 'existed', 'kinescope', 'then', 'only', 'purpose', 'rebroadcasting', 'different', 'time', 'zones', 'concept', 'rerun', 'syndication', 'had', 'not', 'occurred', 'producers', 'time', 'were', 'made', 'exception', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Desi', 'Arnaz', 'New', 'digital', 'techniques', 'have', 'allowed', 'early', 'kinescopes', 'be', 'transferred', 'viewed', 'better', 'clarity', 'ever', 'new', 'package', 'Criterion', 'fine', 'dramas', '1950', 'many', 'went', 'be', 'made', 'acclaimed', 'motion', 'pictures.EPISODES', 'Marty', '1953', 'motion', 'picture', 'was', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'winner', '1955', 'version', 'role', 'Marty', 'played', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'role', 'girl', 'played', 'Nancy', 'Marchand', 'Written', 'Paddy', 'Chayefsky.Patterns', '1955', 'Written', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'Show', 'starred', 'Richard', 'Kiley', 'young', 'executive', 'Fred', 'Staples', 'However', 'Staples', 'can', 'see', 'possible', 'distant', 'future', 'aging', 'executive', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'who', 'constantly', 'berated', 'belittled', 'boss', 'Everett', 'Sloane', '.No', 'Time', 'Sergeants', '1955', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'cast', 'Will', 'Stockdale', 'backwoods', 'fellow', 'who', 'drafted', 'army', 'Harry', 'Clark', 'sergeant', 'nemesis', 'play', 'was', 'basis', 'TV', 'Show', 'Gomer', 'Pyle', 'U.S.M.C', 'ran', '1964', '1969.A', 'South', '1955', 'Julie', 'Harris.Requiem', 'Heavyweight', '1956', 'Written', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'slow-witted', 'mountain', 'man', 'who', 'suddenly', 'boxing', 'career', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'next.Bang', 'Drum', 'Slowly', '1956', 'Written', 'Mark', 'Harris', 'starring', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'one', 'earliest', 'performances', 'story', 'baseball', 'team', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'version', 'New', 'York', 'Yankees', 'catcher', 'Hodgkin', 'disease', 'tries', 'conceal', 'ailment.The', 'Comedian', '1957', 'Written', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'starring', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'difficult', 'TV', 'comedian', 'who', 'brother', 'Mel', 'Torme', 'one', 'gag', 'writers', 'Edmund', ""O'Brien"", 'brink', 'insanity', 'behavior.Days', 'Wine', 'Roses', '1958', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'are', 'couple', 'lives', 'are', 'ruined', 'alcoholism.Extra', 'features', 'Commentaries', 'directors', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'Delbert', 'Mann', 'Ralph', 'Nelson', 'Daniel', 'PetrieInterviews', 'key', 'cast', 'crew', 'including', 'Frankenheimer', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'Kim', 'Hunter', 'Richard', 'Kiley', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'Nancy', 'Marchand', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Carol', 'Serling', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'Mel', 'TormePLUS', 'booklet', 'featuring', 'essay', 'curator', 'Ron', 'Simon', 'extensive', 'liner', 'notes', 'program']",N/A

Suffice it to say, there's hardly a title that doesn't surpass anything on the tube today. Come on, is there a funnier show than ""The Honeymooners"" (The Big Bang Theory"" - please) better drama then ""Requiem for a Heavy Weight"" (Jersey Shore - ugh). You know in your heart of hearts the answer is no. There are two good reasons for this and let me let you in on the secret. There isn't enough talent in the world to write for seventy or eighty networks, not at the level of this quality. It was hard enough to do it for three back in the fifties. Most of the talent on these shows were Broadway trained, meaning they didn't have to do one take after another to get it right. Does anybody really think that Charlie Sheen is in even in the same world as Paul Newman? The other reason is very obscure and has to do with Channel 2. Back in the early 50's, William Paley, the ""feared by everyone"" CEO of CBS was buying up channels or making deals with affiliates that were broadcast on the frequency alloted Channel 2. Why? Because, as any elderly engineer will tell you, Channel 2 has a larger reception area than Channel 4, or 7 or heaven forbid 13. At the end of the 50's Paley, who was quite an intellectual himself, realized, that most people didn't want to see Broadway plays that challenged the intellect. They wanted eye candy that didn't force their brains to work beyond a certain level. So, he decided that instead of authentically great shows like Studio One or Playhouse 90, his network would produce crap, like The Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres. His reasoning was that Channel 2 (of which he controlled many) would get out into the countryside, where people who would eat up his countrified shows. Turns out he was right. Now this is not to knock people who have low brow taste - it's just the way it is. And the Golden Age of television disappeared in a few seasons, but what the heck, we did get ""My Mother the Car"".",5,Face It - TV Has Gone Downhill Since the Beverly Hillbillies,1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,2024,"['Okay', 'are', 'enough', 'reviews', 'tell', 'detail', 'what', 'shows', 'was', 'about', 'Suffice', 'say', 'hardly', 'title', ""n't"", 'surpass', 'anything', 'tube', 'today', 'Come', 'there', 'funnier', 'show', 'Honeymooners', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'please', 'better', 'drama', 'then', 'Requiem', 'Heavy', 'Weight', 'Jersey', 'Shore', 'ugh', 'know', 'heart', 'hearts', 'answer', 'are', 'two', 'good', 'reasons', 'let', 'let', 'secret', ""n't"", 'enough', 'talent', 'world', 'write', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'networks', 'not', 'level', 'quality', 'was', 'hard', 'enough', 'do', 'three', 'back', 'fifties', 'Most', 'talent', 'shows', 'were', 'Broadway', 'trained', 'meaning', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'one', 'take', 'get', 'right', 'Does', 'anybody', 'really', 'think', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'even', 'same', 'world', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'other', 'reason', 'very', 'obscure', 'do', 'Channel', '2', 'Back', 'early', '50', 'William', 'Paley', 'feared', 'everyone', 'CEO', 'CBS', 'was', 'buying', 'up', 'channels', 'making', 'deals', 'affiliates', 'were', 'broadcast', 'frequency', 'alloted', 'Channel', '2', 'Why', 'elderly', 'engineer', 'will', 'tell', 'Channel', '2', 'larger', 'reception', 'area', 'Channel', '4', '7', 'heaven', 'forbid', '13', 'end', '50', 'Paley', 'who', 'was', 'quite', 'intellectual', 'realized', 'most', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Broadway', 'challenged', 'intellect', 'wanted', 'eye', 'candy', 'did', ""n't"", 'force', 'brains', 'work', 'certain', 'level', 'So', 'decided', 'instead', 'authentically', 'great', 'shows', 'Studio', 'One', 'Playhouse', '90', 'network', 'would', 'produce', 'crap', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'Green', 'Acres', 'reasoning', 'was', 'Channel', '2', 'controlled', 'many', 'would', 'get', 'out', 'countryside', 'where', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'eat', 'up', 'countrified', 'shows', 'out', 'was', 'right', 'Now', 'not', 'knock', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'low', 'brow', 'taste', 'just', 'way', 'Golden', 'Age', 'television', 'disappeared', 'few', 'seasons', 'what', 'heck', 'did', 'get', 'Mother', 'Car']",N/A

Like another recent box set of anthology plays I enjoy these kind of shows and little was shown in my territory at the time in Australia. The shows were kinescoped on ""Live"" presentation and we are lucky so many survived and in reasonable condition. They can vary because of the quality of the monitor that was used to record the shows direct to the camera and the ultimate processing at a lab. Sure the sets are simple and it shows but what the heck there are good old performers giving their all in these dramas.

1277572,A2M22E7J0D8LDT,B002M36R1O,"Mark Cheney ""semi-human being""","[17, 17]","I want to address a specific issue concerning Rod Serling's ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"", which is arguably the jewel in the crown of Criterion's ""The Golden Age of Television"" DVD set.One of the problems with digital technology is that some people can't resist trying to ""fix"" older film and television resources. The overuse of clean-up software is a good example: When applied injudiciously, characters waving their arms or walking quickly will have their hands or feet virtually disappear. Over-correction can be worse than none at all, since new errors are introduced and the material is compromised.Criterion apparently thought that the soundtrack on ""Requiem"" was too noisy, so they applied a noise-gate. The result is that when a character stops talking, low-level sounds like background conversations or the music score are abruptly cut off or, worse, sputter in and out, sounding like someone jiggling a loose speaker wire. Sometimes even the dialogue is affected. This is too bad, especially since it was unnecessary.Criterion's source for the kinescopes was the early-'eighties program ""The Golden Age of Television"". Rhino Records released some of these same episodes (""Requiem"", ""Patterns"", and ""The Comedian"") on VHS in 1993. I did a direct comparison between Rhino's VHS and Criterion's DVD, and saw that they appeared to derive from the same source: Both pictures are slightly dark on the left-hand side and lack contrast on the right-hand side, for example. But Criterion apparently tried to boost the contrast, which aggravated the left-to-right disparity. So, although Rhino's version has the inherent characteristics of VHS, their picture is more consistent.But the real problem with Criterion's ""Requiem"", as I said, is the soundtrack: The sound on the Rhino release is fine, but that on the Criterion version is painful to listen to. It's bad. It would be acceptable if there were no other choice, but, judging by the far-superior sound on Rhino's tape, there was no reason to tamper with it. I had them playing side by side for this comparison; every time I heard a particularly bad passage on the Criterion disk, I listened to the same passage on the Rhino tape, and Rhino's sound was always clear, with no drop-outs.What a shame!
