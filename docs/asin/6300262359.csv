Very witty & well written story, told in flashback, of child, played wonderfully by little prodigy Drew Barrymore, who's divorcing her battling parents. Little Drew seems to be the only sane person here, the adults all progressively deteriorating into vindictive, obnoxious, immature beings. The parents are portrayed with comic skill by Ryan O'Neal & Shelley Long. Watching them meet, fall in whirlwind love, achieve fame, grow apart... is funnier than it sounds, though also at times very moving. Sharon Stone, in what I believe was her introductory role, is hysterical as new star ""Blake Chandler"", the obnoxious, self-centered opportunist in sheeps clothing. Her scene in O'Neals characters pathetic and doomed musical version of ""Gone With The Wind"", where she sings, always cracks me up, she is so perfectly talentless, arrogant, and awful.

It was well done, charming, and worth repeat viewings.Lionsgate has done an appallingly awful job on this DVD.  They don't even know who their audience are...It opens with a very inappropriate red-banded, R rated noisy hard-sell preview of a horror movie, followed by another horror preview.  Both of these fourth-rate screamers have unknown casts, yet they were treated infinitely better than the feature we are paying for on this disc - a well written movie starring four very famous actors.  While the horror movies got newly remastered in widescreen with new interviews, this movie seems to have been copied from a grainy pan/scan transfer on an old VHS tape.The gratingly cheesy-busy menus seem to have been made up by someone who thinks the 80s were nothing but disco.  The scene selection is lazily authored to force the viewer to manually navigate from page to page, rather than linking them together so you can right click through them all in sequence.The picture is so dark that many scenes are now played out almost totally unwatchably in black screen or shadows.  There are eve changeover cues, meaning it was transferred from an old exhibition print.Clearly the principle that anything worth doing is worth doing well is lost on Lionsgate.  They obviously have no respect for this movie, which they refer to as ""forgotten"" on the cover, and have deliberately issued a product that is obsolete.  It's amazing that they would list ""full screen"" as a ""feature"" in today's world when even broadcast TV is going widescreen.  The fact is that for a great many people who buy this, it will NOT be in full-screen at all, and it is missing maybe a third of the picture from its Original Aspect Ratio.Ryan O'Neal, Shelly Long, Drew Barrymore, Sharon Stone, Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer all have good reason to be proud of this charming film.  You'd think they wouldn't mind sharing some interesting thoughts about it for a commentary or ""Making of"" featurette, but nooooo... Lionsgate couldn't be bothered to consider that.  All we get here is a little trivia track that's less informative than annoying by taking a Quiz format rather then just delivering the mostly Irrelevant information.This product is a slap in the face of anyone who worked on, or likes this movie.  SHAME on Lionsgate for treating obscure horror movies better than this one!  I will from here on heavily suspect any product from Lionsgate, and rent their titles rather than buy.Bottom line, there is no excuse for releasing this bad a product.  The disc should be recalled, competently remastered in its full aspect ratio from a good print, and reissued with at least a commentary track.

230630,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6300262359,Gregor von Kallahann,"[2, 4]","There's a scene in this film that viewers who know anything about Drew Barrymore's personal history will almost certainly find disturbing.  Her nine-year old character Casey Brodsky is at a party given by her non-custodial film-director dad, and she is plainly unhappy.  None of the self-obsessed adults pay any attention to the child, and when a waiter whizzes by her with a tray of drinks, she grabs a glass of wine and slugs it down.  Barrymore, of course, developed drug and drink habits before even hitting adolescence, we know now, and one hates to think that any of the roles she played as a child might have given her ideas.But the reality is, of course, that Drew's milieu was similar enough to Casey's in the film that own her pre-adolescent descent into substance abuse might have been almost impossible to avoid anyway, regardless of the roles she might have played.  Ultimately, Casey's own story has a qualified happy ending--as do those of her feuding parents--and there's reason to hope that her character's life will improve.  Nevertheless, the scene resonates, perhaps moreso than any other in the entire film.There's a certain honesty in this film's representation of a Hollywood childhood--and of Hollywood life in general.  Hollywood is seen as a corrupting influence on basically good, intelligent--and talented--people who should be able to see the damage they do themselves and their child.  In flashback, we see how the parents meet (and they do meet, as they say in Tinseltown, ""cute,"" but also very innocent and rough around the edges).  Dad (Ryan O'Neal) is a young(ish) film scholar who yearns to break into directing--somehow.  For now, he's accepted a post at a film school.  Shelley Long is the mom, but prior to that she was an educated but somewhat aimless young woman who, until our young director type, swept her off her feet was on her way to marry someone else ( a military man, who, we are led to believe, would almost certainly have made her even more miserable that the director ultimately will.Shelley Long is Lucy Van Patten Brodsky in this film, but she is essentially in Diane mode (maybe just a bit sweeter natured).  Her character is vaguely ""creative,"" but doesn't really blossom until she gets a chance to co-author her husband's scripts.  She doesn't get the credit she deserves, of course, and that leads to some resentment when those scripts turn into highly successful film properties.  O'Neal's Albert Brodsky gets all the glory, and the apparent adoration of a young protegee (a very funny, and very GOOD Sharon Stone).  The marriage hits the rocks, predictably enough, and a series of career ups and downs for the warring parents is set into motion.  (Shelley goes from being an economically stressed single mom to an overnight literary sensation--just as Ryan hits bottom by going along with his consorts ludicrous demands to make a musical out of GONE WITH THE WIND, a move which is actually HIS HEAVEN'S GATE.So what's a nine-year old to do but seek a ""divorce"" from BOTH her parents.  Her dream is to live with Maria, the Hispanic maid who first worked for them as a couple, them for him when he was flush, and then for HER when the tide turned.  But through it all, Maria was the one person who was there for the little girl.  Sound hokey enough?  Well, it is--and it isn't.The storyline is so preposterous that I avoided this film for over 20 years.  Yes, sometimes minors in their ""late-ish"" teens can become legally emancipated, but younger children have no such recourse, even in Hollywood.  So you gotta suspend a heck of a lot of disbelief.  But if you can manage to do that, there is much in the film that makes it worth watching.  The inside showbiz humor is pretty sharp.  The film whiz kid who rises and falls in Hollywood has its real life analogs, of course, and Brodsky is obviously patterned Bogdanovich, whose own talent was undercut by vanity (projects).The serious message behind all the spoofing is that contemporary LIFE (not just show biz values) takes a toll on us all, despite our best intentions and good will toward man, woman and child.  In a better world, all of these differences would by no means be ""irreconcilable.""  In a simpler world--like that of the Mexican maid--they might be more readily dealt with, or even successfully ignored in the daily struggle to survive.IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES is something of a morality play for (post)modern times.  It doesn't succeed wholly, but it works well enough to engage our sympathies and our minds.  It's ""bittersweet"" ending is really the only one possible, but in life, like in the movies, there is hope.

230635,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,6300262359,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[7, 8]","""Irreconcilable Differences"" is finally coming to DVD, and all I can say is: IT'S ABOUT TIME! This is a wonderful underrated movie that was released in theaters way back in the fall of 1984. I remembered seeing it at the theater when it was released. My mother took me to see this and the Sally Field movie ""Places in the Heart"" in the same day. And it was great to see not one but two great movies at the theater in one day. However ""Irreconcilable Differences"" was not a hit at the box office, and got pretty much lost while waiting for a DVD release. It was released on home video in the old VHS format, but it has taken what has seemed like forever for the film to get released on DVD. I was constantly checking amazon.com to see if this movie was ever going to be released, and was getting frustrated not seeing anything about a DVD release date. That was until today, when at long last I found out that this terrific little movie was finally getting released on DVD.""Irreconcilable Differences"" is a comedy-drama that tells the story of a Hollywood couple who marry, have a kid, make movies, write novels, and in the end (after one fight too many) are sued for divorce by their 9 year-old daughter. The stars are: Ryan O'Neal, who was still a big star at the time this movie was made (he has since pretty much disappeared from the acting scene and has been having personal problems in real life); Shelley Long, who was starring on the hit TV sitcom ""Cheers"" at the time when she made this; a very young Drew Barrymore, who made this a few years after hitting it big with Steven Spielberg's blockbuster ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial""; and a young Sharon Stone, who would go on to be a big star of 90's movies such as ""Total Recall"", ""Basic Instinct"", and ""Casino"". It was directed by Charles Shyer, who co-wrote the screenplay with Nancy Meyers (his wife at the time). This is the same team who won an Oscar nomination for writing the screenplay to Goldie Hawn's hit 1980 comedy ""Private Benjamin"" and would go on to make the hit comedies ""Baby Boom"" (1987), ""Father of the Bride"" (1991), and ""Father of the Bride 2"" (1995). Meyers later turned to directing and scored box office hits with ""The Parent Trap"" (1998), ""What Women Want"" (2000), and ""Something's Gotta Give"" (2003).""Irreconcilable Differences"" wasn't a hit at the box office, but it received some good reviews from the critics (overall the critical response was mixed). Roger Ebert and his late partner Gene Siskel gave it two thumbs up (both critics gave the movie 3 1/2 stars for their newspaper reviews), and it received 2 Golden Globe nominations: Shelley Long was nominated for Best Actress in a Motion Picture (Musical/Comedy), and Drew Barrymore was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture. Everybody does a good job here. O'Neal, Long, and Barrymore are perfect as the Hollywood family who go through good times at first, then rough times later when the couple split up after constantly fighting all the time and in the process ignore their little girl, who feels lost through all of this and decides enough is enough.I'm hoping that ""Irreconcilable Differences"" will be released in the widescreen format on DVD. That's the way to view movies. I'm also hoping for some extras on the DVD too. But even if there aren't any extras on the DVD, I'm just glad that it's finally coming to DVD period. It's been long overdue.WARNING: If you're looking for perfect DVD quality with this film, you might be disappointed. While it was great to see this movie again after not seeing it for so long, the DVD quality of ""Irreconcilable Differences"" is not the best. All they did was copy the movie off of one of those old VHS tapes from its' original VHS distributor, Vestron Video, and on to a DVD disk (you'll see that old Vestron Video logo on the DVD right before the movie starts, just like it was on the VHS tape). This perfectly explains why the DVD of this film is not in widescreen. And it also explains why the movie doesn't have quite the clear look that you see on most DVD's today. While I may have been a tad bit disappointed by the DVD quality of this film, it's not really all that bad. At least they found a VHS tape of this film that was in pretty good shape. I've seen a lot of DVD's that have been transferred from an old VHS tape to a DVD disk in far worse condition than this. So overall, I'm satisfied with the ""Irreconcilable Differences"" DVD.",5,Wonderful underrated movie,1236729600,"03 11, 2009",2009,4445,"['Irreconcilable', 'Differences', 'finally', 'coming', 'DVD', 'can', 'say', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'TIME', 'wonderful', 'underrated', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'way', 'back', 'fall', '1984', 'remembered', 'seeing', 'theater', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'mother', 'took', 'see', 'Sally', 'Field', 'movie', 'Places', 'Heart', 'same', 'day', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'great', 'movies', 'theater', 'one', 'day', 'However', 'Irreconcilable', 'Differences', 'was', 'not', 'hit', 'box', 'office', 'got', 'pretty', 'much', 'lost', 'waiting', 'DVD', 'release', 'was', 'released', 'home', 'video', 'old', 'VHS', 'format', 'taken', 'seemed', 'forever', 'film', 'get', 'released', 'DVD', 'was', 'constantly', 'checking', 'amazon.com', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'ever', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'was', 'getting', 'frustrated', 'not', 'seeing', 'anything', 'DVD', 'release', 'date', 'was', 'today', 'when', 'long', 'last', 'found', 'out', 'terrific', 'little', 'movie', 'was', 'finally', 'getting', 'released', 'DVD', 'Irreconcilable', 'Differences', 'comedy-drama', 'story', 'Hollywood', 'couple', 'who', 'marry', 'have', 'kid', 'make', 'movies', 'write', 'novels', 'end', 'one', 'fight', 'too', 'many', 'are', 'sued', 'divorce', '9', 'year-old', 'daughter', 'stars', 'are', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'who', 'was', 'still', 'big', 'star', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'pretty', 'much', 'disappeared', 'acting', 'scene', 'been', 'having', 'personal', 'problems', 'real', 'life', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'who', 'was', 'starring', 'hit', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'Cheers', 'time', 'when', 'made', 'very', 'young', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'who', 'made', 'few', 'years', 'hitting', 'big', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'blockbuster', 'E.T', 'Extra', 'Terrestrial', 'young', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'be', 'big', 'star', '90', 'movies', 'such', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'Casino', 'was', 'directed', 'Charles', 'Shyer', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'wife', 'time', 'same', 'team', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'hit', '1980', 'comedy', 'Private', 'Benjamin', 'would', 'go', 'make', 'hit', 'comedies', 'Baby', 'Boom', '1987', 'Father', 'Bride', '1991', 'Father', 'Bride', '2', '1995', 'Meyers', 'later', 'turned', 'directing', 'scored', 'box', 'office', 'Parent', 'Trap', '1998', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', '2000', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', '2003', 'Irreconcilable', 'Differences', 'was', ""n't"", 'hit', 'box', 'office', 'received', 'good', 'reviews', 'critics', 'overall', 'critical', 'response', 'was', 'mixed', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'late', 'partner', 'Gene', 'Siskel', 'gave', 'two', 'critics', 'gave', 'movie', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'newspaper', 'reviews', 'received', '2', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nominations', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Musical/Comedy', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Everybody', 'good', 'job', 'here', ""O'Neal"", 'Long', 'Barrymore', 'are', 'perfect', 'Hollywood', 'family', 'who', 'go', 'good', 'times', 'first', 'then', 'rough', 'times', 'later', 'when', 'couple', 'split', 'up', 'constantly', 'fighting', 'time', 'process', 'ignore', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'lost', 'enough', 'enough.I', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'Irreconcilable', 'Differences', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'widescreen', 'format', 'DVD', 'way', 'view', 'movies', ""'m"", 'also', 'hoping', 'extras', 'DVD', 'too', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'extras', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'finally', 'coming', 'DVD', 'period', 'been', 'long', 'overdue.WARNING', ""'re"", 'looking', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'quality', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'not', 'seeing', 'so', 'long', 'DVD', 'quality', 'Irreconcilable', 'Differences', 'not', 'best', 'did', 'was', 'copy', 'movie', 'one', 'old', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'original', 'VHS', 'distributor', 'Vestron', 'Video', 'DVD', 'disk', ""'ll"", 'see', 'old', 'Vestron', 'Video', 'logo', 'DVD', 'right', 'movie', 'just', 'was', 'VHS', 'tape', 'perfectly', 'why', 'DVD', 'film', 'not', 'widescreen', 'also', 'why', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'clear', 'look', 'see', 'most', 'DVD', 'today', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'tad', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'quality', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'least', 'found', 'VHS', 'tape', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'shape', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'DVD', 'have', 'been', 'transferred', 'old', 'VHS', 'tape', 'DVD', 'disk', 'far', 'worse', 'condition', 'So', 'overall', ""'m"", 'satisfied', 'Irreconcilable', 'Differences', 'DVD']",N/A

230646,A2M15WTRYMLHFA,6300262359,"Stan Heck ""Movie Man Stan""","[0, 0]",I love this film .It shows what it is like when adults divorce and still fight after the divorce is final.  In this film the child wants nothing to do with her parents because the parents are so self involved that she suffers.  A story the rang true in 1984 that still rings true in 2013.  Nobody in this film gives a false performance.  I was waiting for years for a DVD release and when it came out I was so disappointed and here is why..THE MGM DVD  release  was terrible.  They used the same transfer as the original VHS release.  In fact the MGM was so cheap to make a new transfer that the old VESTRON LOGO WAS INCLUDED on this release. The original Vestron transfer was made in 1985!  (Vestron also has not been around since 1991)!  So on  the DVD  the picture was fuzzy and had a washed out look to it.Also the talent behind the camera is amazing.  This film also has a brilliant comedic performance by  Sharon Stone.  It was one of her first roles.  In fact I became a fan of hers because of this film.  I also have the poster of this film hanging on my wall.I think all divorced parents should watch this with their children.  (Just Cover their eyes because there is a brief topless scene)I can not say enough good things about this film.....,5,I HOPE THIS RELEASE HAS A NEW TRANSFER,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,1252,"['love', 'film', '.It', 'what', 'when', 'adults', 'divorce', 'still', 'fight', 'divorce', 'final', 'film', 'child', 'nothing', 'do', 'parents', 'parents', 'are', 'so', 'self', 'involved', 'A', 'story', 'rang', 'true', '1984', 'still', 'true', '2013', 'Nobody', 'film', 'false', 'performance', 'was', 'waiting', 'years', 'DVD', 'release', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'here', 'why..THE', 'MGM', 'DVD', 'release', 'was', 'terrible', 'used', 'same', 'transfer', 'original', 'VHS', 'release', 'fact', 'MGM', 'was', 'so', 'cheap', 'make', 'new', 'transfer', 'old', 'VESTRON', 'LOGO', 'WAS', 'INCLUDED', 'release', 'original', 'Vestron', 'transfer', 'was', 'made', '1985', 'Vestron', 'also', 'not', 'been', '1991', 'So', 'DVD', 'picture', 'was', 'fuzzy', 'had', 'washed', 'out', 'look', 'it.Also', 'talent', 'camera', 'amazing', 'film', 'also', 'brilliant', 'comedic', 'performance', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'roles', 'fact', 'became', 'fan', 'hers', 'film', 'also', 'have', 'poster', 'film', 'hanging', 'wall.I', 'think', 'divorced', 'parents', 'should', 'watch', 'children', 'Just', 'Cover', 'eyes', 'brief', 'topless', 'scene', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'film', '..']",N/A
230647,A3RWCVHKXK9LTC,6300262359,"waived wench ""waived wench""","[2, 3]","&quot;Irreconcilable Differences&quot; is a small, simple film with a message. Don't pull your children into your troubles! Drew Barrymore plays Casey, a precocious nine year old who decides to divorce her self-absorbed parents after years of being used as a pawn in their bitter feuding. Casey sits on the sidelines watching her parents' love and lives deteriorate and the story is told through flashbacks during testimony in court. There are some funny moments in the film (such as a cocky young starlet's talentless singing about the Civil War), but the whole general effect is very sobering. One particularly poignant note is the parallels that can be made between the film and Drew Barrymore's own childhood. The scene where she sneakily downs a glass of champagne while sitting ignored at her father's New Year's Eve party takes on particular meaning when viewed against her own much publicized battles with youthful addiction. In the end, the film should be made required viewing at divorce cases where children are involved.",4,should be a must-see for all divorcing couples,1061078400,"08 17, 2003",2003,1032,"['quot', 'Irreconcilable', 'Differences', 'quot', 'small', 'simple', 'film', 'message', 'Do', ""n't"", 'pull', 'children', 'troubles', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Casey', 'precocious', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'divorce', 'self-absorbed', 'parents', 'years', 'being', 'used', 'pawn', 'bitter', 'feuding', 'Casey', 'sidelines', 'watching', 'parents', 'love', 'deteriorate', 'story', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'testimony', 'court', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'such', 'cocky', 'young', 'starlet', 'talentless', 'singing', 'Civil', 'War', 'whole', 'general', 'effect', 'very', 'sobering', 'One', 'particularly', 'poignant', 'note', 'parallels', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'film', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'own', 'childhood', 'scene', 'where', 'sneakily', 'glass', 'champagne', 'sitting', 'ignored', 'father', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'party', 'particular', 'meaning', 'when', 'viewed', 'own', 'much', 'publicized', 'battles', 'youthful', 'addiction', 'end', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'required', 'viewing', 'divorce', 'cases', 'where', 'children', 'are', 'involved']",N/A
