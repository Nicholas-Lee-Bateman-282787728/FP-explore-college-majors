31909,A2IAR5XDY0KT2F,0780622588,Becky,"[0, 0]","Adam Sandler has never been sweeter than in the role of slightly schizoid, romantically frustrated wedding singer Robbie, and in the role of Julia, Drew Barrymore has never been sweeter or more adorable, except perhaps,  when she played Gertie in ET.  This entertaining movie focuses on Robbie  Hart, an ex rock singer who now plays mainly at weddings, much to the  disgust of his shallow fiance Linda.  When Linda literally dumps him at the  altar, he is shattered - until he meets the appealing waitress Julia, who  is engaged to the sexist, &quot;Miami Vice&quot; loving philanderer Glenn  Ghoulia, a truly appalling individual and definitely not someone a mother  would want her daughter to fall in love with. Set against the backdrop of  the mid 1980's, this movie also shows viewers that the 1960's and 1970's  weren't the only decades in history which posessed some weird trends and  fads.  The on screen chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore is given an  added boost by the hilarious supporting cast, especially Christine Taylor,  who plays a Madonna wannabe to perfection (the awful fashion sense and  tartishness are completely intact), Steve Buscemi as a scene stealing  drunk, and Alexis Arquette as a Boy George twin whose one song repertoire  completely confounds the guests at two weddings and one bar mitzbah (what  song is it, you ask.

Even though the plot and the ending you can smell a mile away, it's a nice entertaining watch.Adam Sandler plays Robbie Hart, a wedding singer who wants to be a rock star. He's devastated when his fiance, Linda, leaves him at the altar. Things turn around when he starts falling for Julia Sullivan(Drew Barrymore). The only problem is Julia's engaged to a shallow, unfaithful man.One thing that the writers used for laughs is our knowledge of pop culture after the movie is taken place. For example: one woman tells Robbie and Julia they're gonna be an everlasting couple like Donald and Ivana Trump and Burt Reynolds and Loni Anderson although we all know how they turned out. Or when Robbie sees Linda in a Van Halen t-shirt saying &quot;now take it off and you'll jinx the band and they break up&quot; which is partly true. David Lee Roth just quit/fired.Adam brings in a good performance in this by not actually being kind of dumb. Drew is very likeable in this. Has a girl-next-door quality.

Adam Sandler may put out a mediocre movie now and again, but he proves his acting skills in The Wedding Singer.  The adorable Drew Barrymore pretty much breaks the world record for cuteness, innocence, and preciousness in her performance.  Robbie Hart (Sandler) is a wedding singer who is a week away from marrying his sweetheart Linda.  Julia Sullivan (Barrymore) is a waitress who has moved to the city to be closer to her fianc&eacute;e Glenn, whom she fears is never going to set a date for their wedding.  Robbie loves his job and loves helping all sorts of people, but his world crashes down around him when his fianc&eacute;e never shows up for the wedding and later tells him she cannot possibly marry someone who is just a wedding singer in a small town.  Julia is overjoyed when Glenn finally agrees to get married, but she begins to question her feelings as she spends more and more time with Robbie, whom she helps bring out of his Linda-induced  depression.  Both Linda and Glenn are thoroughly shallow, unworthy people.  Naturally, there are all kinds of complications involved in Robbie and Julia actually acknowledging and expressing their feelings for one another, and the movie culminates in Robbie's desperate attempt to find Julia before she gets to Las Vegas and marries Glenn.The theme may sound rather commonplace, and it probably is, but this movie works wonderfully.  The entire cast is wonderful, from an older lady who pays Robbie for singing lessons with meatballs as she learns a song to sing for her husband on their 50th wedding anniversary, to Robbie's strange friend who dresses like Michael Jackson and patterns his life after Fonzie.  Robbie's androgynous, Culture Club-loving backup singer George is a real hoot, and Billie Idol (yes, that Billie Idol) ably adds his own unique touch to the movie.  Not only is the storyline wonderful, refreshing, and touching, the whole film is a treasure trove of 1980s pop culture.  The soundtrack is a veritable smorgasbord of 1980s music, featuring some of the decade's most popular and most distinctive songs.  There are references to the pop culture of the time strewn everywhere, making The Wedding Singer a veritable tribute to my favorite decade.

Their on screen chemistry was very strong in this movie and it felt a little more natural than Sandler and Faruza Balk in The Waterboy.

I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan, but I like this movie for several reasons:Considering the excessive amount of Boomer-driven 60s and 70s nostalgia films out there it's refreshing to see a movie that lovingly sends up the 80s for once. For those of us who grew up in the 80s this movie is a real treat. Sure the movie exaggerates the culture, the outfits, the music, the hair, the television ... but I got a kick out of it anyway. The cameo of Billy Idol was a nice touch.And yes, the love story is a bit cheesy, but it was nice to see both Sandler and Barrymore tone their acts down a bit. There is actually quite a bit of chemistry between these two which overcomes the somewhat obvious storyline. Barrymore used this movie to sweeten up her image, and I had hoped Sandler would do so a well.  He does a decent job when he's not so over the top. Be warned, if you are a fan of 'the Waterboy' and 'Little Nicky' this movie will probably dissappoint you.Anyway, I had a thouroughly good time watching 'The Wedding Singer.'

He's nice to old ladies, lives in his sister's basement, and is the best wedding singer money can buy.  At the opening of the film, Robbie and his bandmates are setting the dancefloor aflame with the 80's classic, ""You Spin Me Round"" (originally by Dead or Alive).  While at this wedding reception, Robbie runs into Julia (played to sweet perfection by Drew Barrymore), a soon-to-be married server with the catering service at the reception.  The two hit it off instantly and become good friends.  Julia even works at Robbie's wedding and witnesses his being left at the altar by his would-be wife, Linda.Robbie falls into a funk, refusing to play any and every wedding reception he's offered, including Julia's.  He eventually agrees to help her set up her wedding with her Don Johnson wannabe fiance, Glenn (Matthew Glave).  As any good romantic comedy would have happen, Robbie and Julia begin to fall for each other and their respective fiances are proven to be no good and undeserving of their love.  Even though, neither Robbie nor Julia can openly reveal their love for one another to anybody.  In the end, everything is tied nicely together by a ballad sung by Robbie, and everyone goes home happy.The cast in this film is wonderful. Christine Taylor plays Holly, Julia's loose cousin.  Frank Sivero is hilarious in a brief role as Robbie's brother-in-law.  Steve Buscemi and Jon Lovitz also have bit roles but make the most of them.  Sandler's buddy, Allen Covert, plays his best friend, Sammy, a limo driver who wants to be like the Fonz.  Alexis Arquette is George, a Boy George lookalike.  Also look for Kevin Nealon as a banker who interviews Robbie.Of course, the one thing most people seem to focus on in this film is the music and fashion of the 80's.  Pop culture abounds in this film with references to Van Halen's breakup, Burt Reynolds and Loni Anderson's ""strong"" marriage, J.R. getting shot on ""Dallas,"" Freddy Krueger, all temperCheer, and the Dunkin' Donuts guy.  The musical lineup includes songs by Journey, Flock of Seagulls, Culture Club, David Bowie, and Huey Lewis and the News among others.  Heck, Billy Idol even has a scene-stealing cameo on a flight to Las Vegas.Obviously, if you grew up in the 80's, you're going to catch onto most of the pop culture references in the film.  However, you need not know them in order to enjoy this film.  It's a hilarious romantic comedy that showcases the talents of Sandler and Barrymore, and I highly recommend it.",4,Sandler Sings For His Supper,1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,2982,"['Adam', 'Sandler', 'film', 'career', 'had', 'ups', 'downs', 'easily', 'forgotten', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'well-intentioned', 'slightly', 'miscued', 'Click', 'Sandler', 'played', 'straight', 'man', 'buffoon', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'Sandler', 'harness', 'inner', 'goofball', 'off', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'what', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'date.Sandler', 'plays', 'Robbie', 'Hart', 'aspiring', 'songwriter', 'who', 'weddings', 'extra', 'cash', 'career', 'off', 'nice', 'old', 'ladies', 'lives', 'sister', 'basement', 'best', 'wedding', 'singer', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'opening', 'film', 'Robbie', 'bandmates', 'are', 'setting', 'dancefloor', 'aflame', '80', 'classic', 'Spin', 'Round', 'originally', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'wedding', 'reception', 'Robbie', 'Julia', 'played', 'sweet', 'perfection', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'soon-to-be', 'married', 'server', 'catering', 'service', 'reception', 'two', 'hit', 'off', 'instantly', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'Julia', 'even', 'Robbie', 'wedding', 'being', 'left', 'altar', 'would-be', 'wife', 'Linda.Robbie', 'funk', 'refusing', 'play', 'wedding', 'reception', 'offered', 'including', 'Julia', 'eventually', 'help', 'set', 'up', 'wedding', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'wannabe', 'fiance', 'Glenn', 'Matthew', 'Glave', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'would', 'have', 'happen', 'Robbie', 'Julia', 'begin', 'fall', 'other', 'respective', 'fiances', 'are', 'proven', 'be', 'good', 'undeserving', 'love', 'Even', 'Robbie', 'Julia', 'can', 'openly', 'reveal', 'love', 'one', 'anybody', 'end', 'everything', 'tied', 'nicely', 'together', 'ballad', 'sung', 'Robbie', 'everyone', 'home', 'happy.The', 'cast', 'film', 'wonderful', 'Christine', 'Taylor', 'Holly', 'Julia', 'loose', 'cousin', 'Frank', 'Sivero', 'hilarious', 'brief', 'role', 'Robbie', 'brother-in-law', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'also', 'have', 'bit', 'roles', 'make', 'most', 'Sandler', 'buddy', 'Allen', 'Covert', 'best', 'friend', 'Sammy', 'limo', 'driver', 'who', 'be', 'Fonz', 'Alexis', 'Arquette', 'George', 'Boy', 'George', 'lookalike', 'Also', 'look', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'banker', 'who', 'Robbie.Of', 'course', 'one', 'thing', 'most', 'people', 'seem', 'focus', 'film', 'music', 'fashion', '80', 'Pop', 'culture', 'film', 'references', 'Van', 'Halen', 'breakup', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Loni', 'Anderson', 'strong', 'marriage', 'J.R.', 'getting', 'shot', 'Dallas', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'temperCheer', 'Dunkin', 'Donuts', 'guy', 'musical', 'lineup', 'songs', 'Journey', 'Flock', 'Seagulls', 'Culture', 'Club', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Huey', 'Lewis', 'News', 'others', 'Heck', 'Billy', 'Idol', 'even', 'scene-stealing', 'cameo', 'flight', 'Las', 'Vegas.Obviously', 'grew', 'up', '80', ""'re"", 'going', 'catch', 'most', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'film', 'However', 'need', 'not', 'know', 'order', 'enjoy', 'film', 'hilarious', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'talents', 'Sandler', 'Barrymore', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

You will know which of these two categories you fall into within 5 seconds of the movie starting. If you start bopping along to the title music, you will love this movie. If you hate the title music, you will hate this movie. By the way, the opening song is You Spin Me Round. Me, I love this movie. It's one of my all-time favourites.The story at one level is a basic romantic comedy; boy meets girl, they fall in love, and despite seemingly insurmountable odds, they get together by the end, which is how you want it to be. It rises above the genre, however, both by being very funny, and by being set in 1985, which allows you to laugh at the fashions and the social mores of a period not all that long past.The movie opens with the aforementioned song, being sung at a wedding by Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler). Robbie Hart is a Wedding Singer, and a very good one at that, as he quickly demonstrates by salvaging the best man's speech from this wedding. We also learn that Robbie is a very kind, generous and caring kind of guy. We also get to meet Julia (Drew Barrymore), a waitress who has just started work at this particular reception hall. Julia is a wonderful, sweet human being. Robbie and Julia develop an instant rapport, and we learn that Robbie himself is getting married next week and Julia is involved in a long term relationship at the moment which doesn't appear to be progressing towards the altar.Robbie's wedding day arrives, but unfortunately, he is left standing at the altar by Linda (Angela Featherstone) whereupon he falls into a deep depression. Robbie's best friend, Sammy (Allen Covert) convinces Robbie to return to work, and an absolutely hysterical sequence follows revolving around the songs Holiday and Love Stinks.Robbie gets to meet Glen, Julia's fianc&eacute; (by now he has proposed). Glen (Matthew Glare) is a big-time Don Johnston wannabe. Julia convinces Robbie to help her with her wedding plans. They have a lot of fun together, including another hysterical scene involving Jimmie Moore and his band (Michael Jay in a cameo role). As a result of this, Julia's cousin, Holly (Christine Taylor) takes an interest in Robbie. This leads to a double date with Robbie, Glen, Julia and Holly, where Robbie learns that Glen is a big-time fink, and has no intention of changing even after he marries Julia.Robbie and Julia's romance now takes a seriously rocky course, with seemingly endless obstructions to their getting together. However, with a little help from Billy Idol and the entire First Class section of a flight to Las Vegas, Robbie and Julia finally get together.

Sandler's honest characterization makes him the object of our sympathy as we follow him through the painful scene in which his fiancee jilts him at the altar.  Robbie's despondence is broken when he meets a sweet girl named Julia (played by Drew Barrymore) who coaxes him into singing at her upcoming wedding to one Glen Goolia.  Whereas Glen has no interest in helping Julia plan the wedding, Robbie offers his expertise and they grow closer together.  Robbie discovers, on a double date, that Glen is quite the player, and has been cheating on Julia.  Later on in the evening, Robbie's ex shows up on his doorstep, paying him a booty call, and gives Julia the wrong impression when she shows up the next morning to confess her newly-realized feelings for him.  In a fit of broken-hearted resolve, she concedes to marrying Glen in Vegas right away.  Once Robbie gets wind of this and delivers his classic oneliner, &quot;Psycho...get out of my VanHalen t-shirt before you jinx the band and they break up,&quot; it's a race against time to get on Julia's flight. He woos her with a song, and well, he doesn't have to do the singing at their wedding.

Adam Sandler plays his most endearing role as Robbie Hart, a wedding singer whose heart was robbed of his parents as a child, then of his bride (at the altar).  Drew Barrymore is the same type of warm, funny character that she plays so well.The jokes and sight gags relating to the ridiculousness of the 80s really score.  Supporting players Christine Taylor as Drew's slutty cousin and Allen Covert as Adam's smooth-talking friend add to the laughs.This particular ""Totally Awesome"" version contains more than five minutes of never-before-seen footage.  One of those scenes is an unfunny exchange between Drew's character and her mother.  The other is a lengthy scene in which Robbie Hart engages in sex talk with an aged woman taking voice lessons from him.  Although the scene's coarseness is likely the reason it was deleted from the theatrical release, it makes an unexpected (though welcome) appearance on this DVD release.The other special feature, a backstage look at the Broadway musical ""The Wedding Singer"" did little to sell me on the play's merits.

This era, known as the 80's, is the setting for this film starring Adam Sandler (&quot;Little Nicky&quot;) and Drew Barrymore (&quot;Charlie's Angels&quot;) in what is one of the best films mad about one of the best decades of the last century.Robbie (Sandler) is a wedding singer who is hired to perform at weddings in the small New Jersey town he resides in. At a wedding banquet, he meets Julia (Barrymore), the cousin of one of his best friends who happens to be the newest waitress at the banquet hall. Robbie seems to be the happiest person on earth, especially since he is marrying his girlfriend. However, plans change, and Robbie finds himself dumped at the altar, lonely and depressed.Julia on the other hand is dating Glenn, a selfish, sexist pig that she believes will make her happy. With Robbie tagging along and helping her plan her upcoming wedding, they get to know each other, and discover the chemistry they have for one another. Only with time do they realize that they are in love, but how will Julia break up her marriage?Directed by Frank Coraci, the &quot;Wedding Singer&quot; is by far the best Adam Sandler film ever made. While his other films do possess humor, the &quot;Wedding Singer&quot; has a romantic plot, with comedy mixed in. Both stars are great, as well as Christine Taylor as Julia's cousin, and Alexis Arquette as Robbie's Boy George-looking band mate. With many hysterical performances, especially that of Robbie's rapping grandmother, the 'Wedding Singer&quot; will make you wish that you were back in time to the 80's.

Every supporting role (even the extras) is perfectly cast and although a few familiar SNL faces (Lovitz/Nealon) show up, the mostly unknown character actors add a touch of reality to the 80's universe they created.The only time Sandler came close to his former glory was after re-teaming with Drew Barrymore for 50 First Dates, but even then his hangers-on buddies and gross-out humor spoil the show.This version of the film has an additional scene (a nice surprise) featuring Rosie and Robbie that is very reminiscent of the ""Meatball"" scene from the theatrical cut, but just as funny.The making of the musical mini-doc only manages to make you realize that the broadway folks had no idea why people loved the movie as they discuss their decisions to replace all the beloved hits from the soundtrack with their own compositions and have the lead actors behave nothing like Adam Sandler or Drew Barrymore-LAME!Finally, the ""80's Mix Tape"" feature provides minimal trivia on the soundtrack songs and then just skips to the scenes in the movie where the music plays in the background which is pretty pointless b/c the music plays throughout the movie, so you might as well just watch the film itself over again.But the reason for the DVD is the great movie and not the extras (at least in this case) so if you don't already own it on DVD pick up this version, for nothing else than a few extra minutes of Sandler in his prime.",5,Sandler Peaked With His 3rd Film,1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,2009,"['perfect', 'blend', 'insecure', 'charm', 'silly', 'singing', 'wacky', 'supporting', 'cast', 'sad', 'none', 'Sandler', 'other', 'films', 'were', 'ever', 'enjoyable.I', 'have', 'been', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'fan', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'seeing', '3', 'times', 'theater', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'continued', 'trend', 'comedy', 'excellence', 'then', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'came', 'along', 'showed', 'Sandler', 'was', 'capable', 'blending', 'real', 'heart', 'outrageous', 'humor.The', 'key', 'film', 'first', '2', 'later', 'efforts', 'cast', 'not', 'consist', 'solely', 'Happy', 'Madison', 'Gang', 'aka', 'friends', 'Sandler', 'Every', 'supporting', 'role', 'even', 'extras', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'few', 'familiar', 'SNL', 'Lovitz/Nealon', 'show', 'up', 'mostly', 'unknown', 'character', 'actors', 'add', 'touch', 'reality', '80', 'universe', 'created.The', 'only', 'time', 'Sandler', 'came', 'close', 'former', 'glory', 'was', 're-teaming', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', '50', 'First', 'Dates', 'even', 'then', 'hangers-on', 'buddies', 'gross-out', 'humor', 'spoil', 'show.This', 'version', 'film', 'additional', 'scene', 'nice', 'surprise', 'featuring', 'Rosie', 'Robbie', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Meatball', 'scene', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'just', 'funny.The', 'making', 'musical', 'mini-doc', 'only', 'make', 'realize', 'broadway', 'folks', 'had', 'idea', 'why', 'people', 'loved', 'movie', 'discuss', 'decisions', 'replace', 'beloved', 'hits', 'soundtrack', 'own', 'compositions', 'have', 'lead', 'actors', 'behave', 'nothing', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Drew', 'Barrymore-LAME', 'Finally', '80', 'Mix', 'Tape', 'feature', 'minimal', 'trivia', 'soundtrack', 'songs', 'then', 'just', 'skips', 'scenes', 'movie', 'where', 'music', 'background', 'pretty', 'pointless', 'music', 'movie', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'watch', 'film', 'reason', 'DVD', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'extras', 'least', 'case', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'own', 'DVD', 'pick', 'up', 'version', 'nothing', 'else', 'few', 'extra', 'minutes', 'Sandler', 'prime']",N/A

This film seems to mark his transition into the more modern, sometimes disgusting, movies we see today.  This film was still miles better than those.  When local wedding singer Robbie Hart, played by Sandler, is dumped by his fianc&eacute;e the day after their wedding that she didn't show up for, he spirals down into a nervous breakdown that sadly is fun to watch.  Along the way, he befriends Julia Sullivan, played by Drew Barrymore, a waitress preparing for her own wedding to Australian businessman Glenn Gulia, played by Matthew Glave (yes, they do point out the future couple's name situation.)  Their relationship blossoms and feelings soon develop, all while the wedding plans move right on ahead.  This film has the corny moments that many of Adam Sandler's early films were known for, but they were sweet and the plane scene at the end was especially fun.  While he is childish at times this is a version of Sandler that can be more easily related to as opposed to his later characters.

While he is very funny and great at playing those characters, he was painting himself into a corner.  He really turned heads with his portrayal of Robbie Hart in The Wedding Singer.  The movie takes place in a Northern New Jersey town circa 1985.  Robbie is a popular wedding singer who is about get married himself.  He meets Julia who is a server at the catering hall he performs at.  She too is engaged and they strike up a friendship.  Robbie is stood up at the altar and sinks into a depression.  He is revived out of it by Julia, whom he then falls for. He finds out that her fianc&eacute; is a jerk who fools around on her.

Like most people, much of my high school career was awkward, and I was not one of the &quot;popular&quot; kids.  But strangely enough, I look back on the entire decade with a sort of wistful nostalgia that I didn't even realize I possessed the capacity for--until I saw The Wedding Singer.I've seen The Wedding Singer countless times now, and like some other beautiful films (like Groundhog Day), it never gets old or boring.  Maybe it's because I AM the demographic that this movie is shooting for--a guy who went through puberty in the mid 80's, and a guy who loves romantic comedies, especially when the main character of said romantic comedy is a lovable schlemiel, and even more especially when the leading lady is as lovely and wholesome as Drew Barrymore.  I think that accounts for part of it, certainly, and I'm not sure how comfortable I'd be in recommending this movie to someone who doesn't relate to watching Fonzie growing up, and making fun of Culture Club in junior high, and thinking that Billy Idol was the coolest bad dude around.On the other hand, a good movie is a good movie, and this one passes all the tests for me.  It's an intelligent script.  The acting is good, especially the dynamite performance of Steve Buscemi, who's got to be the coolest weirdo I've ever seen in a movie.  And Jon Lovitz's cameo has me laughing just thinking about it.And most importantly, it's a comedy that makes me laugh.  And I laugh almost nonstop throughout the movie, and after the movie, I have the warm fuzzies, thinking that maybe even a lovable 80's schlemiel might someday encounter true love with a beautiful, wholesome young Drew Barrymore type.And that's a pretty good feeling to have after watching a movie.",5,True Love and the 1980's,1001808000,"09 30, 2001",2001,1763,"['graduated', 'high', 'school', '1988', 'most', 'people', 'much', 'high', 'school', 'career', 'was', 'awkward', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'quot', 'popular', 'quot', 'kids', 'strangely', 'enough', 'look', 'back', 'entire', 'decade', 'sort', 'wistful', 'nostalgia', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'possessed', 'capacity', 'saw', 'Wedding', 'Singer.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'countless', 'times', 'now', 'other', 'beautiful', 'films', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'never', 'old', 'boring', 'Maybe', 'AM', 'demographic', 'movie', 'shooting', 'guy', 'who', 'went', 'puberty', 'mid', '80', 'guy', 'who', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'especially', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'said', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'lovable', 'schlemiel', 'even', 'more', 'especially', 'when', 'leading', 'lady', 'lovely', 'wholesome', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'think', 'accounts', 'part', 'certainly', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'comfortable', ""'d"", 'be', 'recommending', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'relate', 'watching', 'Fonzie', 'growing', 'up', 'making', 'fun', 'Culture', 'Club', 'junior', 'high', 'thinking', 'Billy', 'Idol', 'was', 'coolest', 'bad', 'dude', 'other', 'hand', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'tests', 'intelligent', 'script', 'acting', 'good', 'especially', 'dynamite', 'performance', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'who', 'got', 'be', 'coolest', 'weirdo', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'cameo', 'laughing', 'just', 'thinking', 'about', 'most', 'importantly', 'comedy', 'laugh', 'laugh', 'almost', 'nonstop', 'movie', 'movie', 'have', 'warm', 'fuzzies', 'thinking', 'maybe', 'even', 'lovable', '80', 'schlemiel', 'might', 'someday', 'encounter', 'true', 'love', 'beautiful', 'wholesome', 'young', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'type.And', 'pretty', 'good', 'feeling', 'have', 'watching', 'movie']",N/A

Frank Coraci knows that sweet spot in Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore and gets it out of them in The Wedding Singer. People who don't &quot;get&quot; Adam Sandler's movies associate him with crass body function jokes, ridiculous characters with childish made-up accents and a penchant for violence. Coraci understands that side of Sandler as well and gave him free reign when he directed the Waterboy.  That certainly is one side of Adam Sandler. But there is another side of Sander that is easy to be fond of.  The one that loves little kids because he still is one himself. Loves his grandma and old people because they used to give him cookies. The one that likes girls and Rock and Roll just because they make him feel real good when they are around. And there is the slightly shy and gentle Sandler that you sometimes see on talkshows or when he breaks up during a skit. That is much more the real Adam Sandler when he is not allowed to play a character. It is also the Sandler you get in this funny heartwarming romantic comedy set in the eighties.Sandler plays Robbie Hart who is the kind of guy that is always looking out for the shy or forgotten person in the room, then works out something sweet to turn the evening around for them. He likes people and everybody likes him in turn. He is a wedding singer in part because he loves weddings and believes in family and happily ever afters. Until his own wedding where all his hopes and fantasies are dashed when his girlfriend leaves him standing at the altar. Unable to contain his embittered feelings, to the horror of his clients, Robbie lashes out at romance and love at their weddings. Enter an extremely likeable and sweet Drew Barrymore who remembers his better self and slowly helps him put his heart back together. If you haven't liked Adam Sandler in his other films it is very hard not to like him as Robbie Hart. This is a film that enjoys people and it is fun to recognize types you have seen at other weddings you may have attended. Unlike some of Sandlers other films, people are not treated in a cartoon fashion. Always there is a sense of genuiness and affection. If you enjoyed the eighties as much as I did, you will get a kick out the music and off handed references.  Cameo appearances by Billy Idol as himself, Jon Lovitz as the &quot;other&quot; wedding singer and Steve Buscemi are also great fun.The disc itself is great. Near reference quality. The picture is pristine and the colors are vibrant which really enhances the fun feel and upbeat mood of this romantic comedy. A small number of extras are included, the best of which is a fun little eighties trivia game to stir up some forgotten memories. I had much fun watching this again on DVD.

This movie is funny and romantic. It'a movie for the whole family.The story starts out at a wedding in a Banquet Hall in 1985. There is Robby Hart (Sandler), a engaged wedding singer who is getting married next week. Then there is Julia (Barrymore), also engaged working as a waitress at the hall. Here is where the stuff hits the fan. At Robbie's wedding, he is standing at the alter and no bride. His fianc&eacute; Linda decides to dump him the day of the wedding just leaving him there at the altar.Now Robbie is all alone and going insane. He can't stand singing at weddings anymore. He sings &quot;Love Stinks!&quot; at a wedding and getts beaten up for it. His friend Julia starts befriending Robby more and more and he pulls himself back together as he helps her plan her wedding to her rich, cheating, double crossing fianc&eacute; Glenn. So the two start falling in love. As they fall in love and Julia's wedding day gets closer and closer she is starting to have second thoughts while Glenn could care less if he gets married because he already has girls stashed on the sides. Robbie sets out to win her over. Julia is upset at Robbie because Linda shows up all of a sudden and she thinks they're back together (which they're not). So her and Glenn get on a plane to Vegas to get married. Robbie goes afetr her. He doesn't even realize that he's on the same plane as her. With the help of Billy Idol and a bunch of first class passengers, Robby can finally tell Julia how he feels. Will he get her?This is a great comedy for the whole family to watch.

Robbie, his feathered hair and all, is a good guy though who dreams of writing his own music and marrying his high school girlfriend, the ditzy, big haired and clunky-belted Linda.While doing his DJ duties at one wedding, Robbie meets Julia Sullivan (Drew Barrymore), a waitress who is new to town and looking forward to marrying her own sweetheart, Don Johnson wannabe Glenn, who sole pursuit in life, besides emulating Miami Vice, seems to be chasing tail.Linda decides, in a serious case of bad timing, that Robbie is too small town for her and doesn't show up to their wedding ceremony.  Although he decides to give up wedding singing in a fit of depression, he agrees to help Julia plan her big day with Glenn.  In the process, he falls in love with Julia.Like most romantic comedies, although both leads are perfect for each other, neither realizes it at the same time and only a dramtic intervention at the end of the film will save the day (in this film, Billy Idol is involved!)Look for hilarious bits by Steve Buscemi, as a drunken best man in the wedding that opens the movie, Alexis Arquette as the cross-dressing Boy George lookalike in Robbie's back up band,  Christine Taylor as Julia's promiscuous cousin Holly who strives to be so much like Madonna and Ellen Dow, as a rapping grandmother who is taking singing lessons from Robbie.The soundtrack is wonderful and the feel-good feeling this movie leaves you with will make you long again for the days of Spandau Ballet, John Hughes and Molly Ringwald.Highly recommended.",5,"Love, 1980s Style!!",1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,1938,"['grew', 'up', '1980s', 'particularly', 'were', 'teen', 'bit', 'older', 'then', 'grab', 'Swatch', 'watch', 'leg', 'warmers', 'Members', 'Only', 'jacket', 'Rubik', 'Cube', 'get', 'ready', 'fun', 'trip', 'back', 'excessive', '80s', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Robbie', 'Hart', 'small', 'town', 'DJ', 'who', 'weddings', 'occasional', 'bar', 'mitzvah', 'weekends', 'sixty', 'bucks', 'pop', 'living', 'sister', 'basement', 'Robbie', 'feathered', 'hair', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'dreams', 'writing', 'own', 'music', 'marrying', 'high', 'school', 'girlfriend', 'ditzy', 'big', 'haired', 'clunky-belted', 'Linda.While', 'doing', 'DJ', 'duties', 'one', 'wedding', 'Robbie', 'Julia', 'Sullivan', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'waitress', 'who', 'new', 'town', 'looking', 'forward', 'marrying', 'own', 'sweetheart', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'wannabe', 'Glenn', 'who', 'sole', 'pursuit', 'life', 'emulating', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'be', 'chasing', 'tail.Linda', 'decides', 'serious', 'case', 'bad', 'timing', 'Robbie', 'too', 'small', 'town', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'wedding', 'ceremony', 'give', 'up', 'wedding', 'singing', 'fit', 'depression', 'help', 'Julia', 'plan', 'big', 'day', 'Glenn', 'process', 'love', 'Julia.Like', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'leads', 'are', 'perfect', 'other', 'same', 'time', 'only', 'dramtic', 'intervention', 'end', 'film', 'will', 'save', 'day', 'film', 'Billy', 'Idol', 'involved', 'Look', 'hilarious', 'bits', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'drunken', 'best', 'man', 'wedding', 'movie', 'Alexis', 'Arquette', 'cross-dressing', 'Boy', 'George', 'lookalike', 'Robbie', 'back', 'up', 'band', 'Christine', 'Taylor', 'Julia', 'promiscuous', 'cousin', 'Holly', 'who', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'Madonna', 'Ellen', 'Dow', 'rapping', 'grandmother', 'who', 'taking', 'singing', 'lessons', 'Robbie.The', 'soundtrack', 'wonderful', 'feel-good', 'feeling', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'long', 'again', 'days', 'Spandau', 'Ballet', 'John', 'Hughes', 'Molly', 'Ringwald.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

32047,AKP40TIE5SVSQ,0780622588,Some Gravity,"[1, 2]","I'll start off my review with the whole truth,and nothing but the truth:I am a die hard fan of 80's hair metal,and that,along with hard rock,is my second favorite genre of music. I still do like bands like Motley Crue(and luckily and thankfully,a lot of people still do also),Slaughter,Warrant,etc.-and Adam Sandler is my favorite comedian. And by now,the question you're asking me is,is one of Adam Sandler's films of the late '90's,THE WEDDING SINGER,which takes place in the 80's(even though it was released at a time with bands like The Backstreet Boys all over the radio,still proved to be succesful)any good? Read on for my review of this:The time:1985.The place:Los Angeles,California.The situation:Robbie Hart(Adam Sandler)is a musician who sings at people's weddings...and a lot of people like him. Not only is Hart good at what he does,but he is also a pretty nice guy. And when it is time for Hart to marry a woman named Linda who he loves and is very happy with him(as well as Robbie is very happy with her)Linda calls off the wedding. Her reason for doing this? Linda claims that after waking up one morning and realizes that she is about to marry a wedding singer,isn't crazy about it(ego,anyone?!)and that after realizing she is in love with the Robbie Hart she met years ago and not the Robbie Hart she knows now,she doesn't want to marry Robbie.Then,life goes on--but not neccesarily in a great way.After Linda ends her relationship with Robbie,Robbie is very depressed--and spends half of his time in his sister's basement. Along the way and somewhere in the middle is when Robbie meets a girl named Julia(Drew Barrymore)who is a waitress at where Robbie sings at. Julia is about to marry a man named Glen...except there is a small problem there also. Julia doesn't know whether or not Glen is serious about his relationship with her,and after she and Robbie have met each other,they start doing some thinking and ""investigating"" about their current,former,and possible future relationships--and what happens next? Well,I could tell you that--but then I'd spoil the movie for you!THE WEDDING SINGER is one of my favorite Adam Sandler movies. Sandler is hillarious in this film,and with this film,Sandler is not playing Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore all over again--he is playing a totally new character who has a different personality that Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore had. As a matter of fact,EVERYONE in this film is funny--I especially like the scene that feautures a cameo appearance from Jon Lovitz and the scene that feautures a cameo appearance from Billy Idol. And if you throw in 80's fashion to a movie that was made with great actors and a great and funny story and script,you have an entertaining film--I'm usually not a fan of films that end up in the genre of chick flicks,but even if this film is a chick flick,it is a chick flick that both men and woman should be able to enjoy(actually,it is more of a romantic comedy then it is a chick flick--just in case you were wondering).",5,Funny and Entertaining,1122249600,"07 25, 2005",2005,3017,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'off', 'review', 'whole', 'truth', 'nothing', 'truth', 'am', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', '80', 'hair', 'metal', 'hard', 'rock', 'second', 'favorite', 'genre', 'music', 'still', 'do', 'bands', 'Motley', 'Crue', 'luckily', 'thankfully', 'lot', 'people', 'still', 'do', 'also', 'Slaughter', 'Warrant', 'etc.-and', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'favorite', 'comedian', 'now', 'question', ""'re"", 'asking', 'one', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'films', 'late', ""'90"", 'THE', 'WEDDING', 'SINGER', 'place', '80', 'even', 'was', 'released', 'time', 'bands', 'Backstreet', 'Boys', 'radio', 'still', 'proved', 'be', 'succesful', 'good', 'Read', 'review', 'time:1985.The', 'place', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'California.The', 'situation', 'Robbie', 'Hart', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'musician', 'who', 'people', 'weddings', 'lot', 'people', 'Not', 'only', 'Hart', 'good', 'what', 'also', 'pretty', 'nice', 'guy', 'when', 'time', 'Hart', 'marry', 'woman', 'named', 'Linda', 'who', 'very', 'happy', 'as', 'well', 'Robbie', 'very', 'happy', 'Linda', 'wedding', 'reason', 'doing', 'Linda', 'waking', 'up', 'one', 'morning', 'marry', 'wedding', 'singer', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'ego', 'anyone', 'realizing', 'love', 'Robbie', 'Hart', 'met', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'Robbie', 'Hart', 'now', ""n't"", 'want', 'marry', 'Robbie.Then', 'life', 'not', 'neccesarily', 'great', 'way.After', 'Linda', 'relationship', 'Robbie', 'Robbie', 'very', 'depressed', 'half', 'time', 'sister', 'basement', 'way', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'when', 'Robbie', 'girl', 'named', 'Julia', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'who', 'waitress', 'where', 'Robbie', 'Julia', 'marry', 'man', 'named', 'Glen', 'small', 'problem', 'there', 'also', 'Julia', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'Glen', 'serious', 'relationship', 'Robbie', 'have', 'met', 'other', 'start', 'doing', 'thinking', 'investigating', 'current', 'former', 'possible', 'future', 'relationships', 'what', 'next', 'Well', 'could', 'tell', 'then', ""'d"", 'spoil', 'movie', 'WEDDING', 'SINGER', 'one', 'favorite', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movies', 'Sandler', 'hillarious', 'film', 'film', 'Sandler', 'not', 'playing', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'over', 'again', 'playing', 'totally', 'new', 'character', 'who', 'different', 'personality', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'had', 'matter', 'fact', 'EVERYONE', 'film', 'funny', 'especially', 'scene', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'scene', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Billy', 'Idol', 'throw', '80', 'fashion', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'great', 'actors', 'great', 'funny', 'story', 'script', 'have', 'entertaining', 'film', ""'m"", 'usually', 'not', 'fan', 'films', 'end', 'up', 'genre', 'chick', 'flicks', 'even', 'film', 'chick', 'flick', 'chick', 'flick', 'men', 'woman', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'actually', 'more', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'then', 'chick', 'flick', 'just', 'case', 'were', 'wondering']",N/A

It's also the second pairing between director Frank Coraci and actor/comedian Adam Sandler (Happy Gilmore), the other movie that joins the two is The Waterboy which was released the same year. The movie also stars Drew Barrymore (Never Been Kissed).Sandler plays Robbie Hart, a down-on-his-luck wedding singer who's dumped by his fiance on the day of their wedding. He lives in his sister's basement, and has a cross-dressing sidekick, played by Alexis Arquette who was the fourth guy in Bret's apartment who shoots and misses both John Travolta and Samuel Jackson in Pulp Fiction, who always sings Do You Really Want To Hurt Me by Culture Club. Barrymore plays Julia, a waitress at the banquet hall where Robbie sings, who's about to get married to a rich sleazeball named Glenn who dresses up like Don Johnson from Miami Vice and drives a Delorean from the Back To The Future movie. Robbie and Julia begin a friendship that seems so innocent but they slowly begin falling for one another. Robbie knows that Julia is the one for him and will do anything to get her even if it means that he should get some assistance from Billy Idol!Enjoy the fun of The Wedding Singer and relive the 80's with all its hairstyles, fashion, and tunes featuring The Police, The Thompson Twins, Hall And Oates, Billy Idol, and a hilarious rendition of Rapper's Delight by Sugarhill Gang performed by Ellen Albertini Dow.

Anyways, it's pretty cool.First, Julia (Drew Barrymore) likes this one guy named Glen. He's real rich and has almost everything. Especially for that time.

That's what I try doing with most of my reviews. Just getting sections, but later they see what REALLY happens.Well, Adam Sandler's character is pretty funny on it too. He says this one song he made up was half in the breakup and half when they were together. You should REALLY watch it around that part. And he was also talking to Glen how it was funny that he (Glen) had the last name Gulia. And how if they married her name would be Julia Gulia.

Banks,"[4, 17]","Trying to understand the popularity of The Wedding Singer I've got to assume many never tire of its sappy, done-once-too-many-times formula plot of two people meant for each other about to marry the wrong people. Will they end up happily ever after? What do you think? Harlequin, the romance novel franchise and happy ending specialists, should sue the producers for plagiarism.There are a few rare moments of fun in a movie that, overall, is quite uninspired, too often dull, and as predictable as the characters are unsurprising cardboard cutouts. Headliners Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler frequently make moon eyes at each other but that doesn't equate to chemistry, forget acting. The highlight in this movie is granny getting down to boogey.  Unfortunately, that scene lasts maybe 10 seconds. Plus, it was played to death in the trailers.Adam Sandler allegedly falls apart when his fiance doesn't show up at the wedding. But his grossly exaggerated self-pitty routine is neither believable nor particularly funny. Rarely does his voice veer from a droning monotone. You know you're a bad actor when Billy Idol's acting steals a scene from you during a cameo! His funniest moment is his unintentional bad lip syncing during his final tear-jerking silly love song. The good news is at least Drew Barrymore can act which, in this flick, is a very lonely job.If you yearn for '80s pop tunes, the sound track is the best part of the Wedding Singer and, to large extent, helps the audience pass the time.

Robbie is a goodhearted wedding singer who gets paid in meatballs (along with money from others) by a energetic elderly woman. Robbie's fiancee Linda leaves him during the movie, towards the beginning. Now enters Julia. Julia (played by Barrymore) hires Robbie to help her plan her upcoming wedding to Glen Grulia. They soon become fast friends, but quickly fall in love. The problem is that Julia (soon to become ""Julia Gulia"") is already engaged. Julia later questions the authenticity of she and Glen's relationship with one hilarious near-closing scene. This is a HILARIOUS movie that I would recommend to anyone. The MPAA rated it PG-13, but it is worthy of a mere PG rating. If you have kids maybe 9+, they would enjoy it. It's great, for every generation.

I also loved the old lady, especially when she was rapping to the Sugar Hill Gang, rapper's delight. I also liked seeing Alexis Arquette, she's always a trip and a current drag queen pre-op transexual. The Wedding Singer is a nostalgic throwback to a very cool time in history, the totally awesome 80's and I think Adam Sandler honoured that time comedically beautiful.",5,Big Fun,1303516800,"04 23, 2011",2011,502,"['love', '80', 'music', 'fashion', 'sheer', 'tackiness', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'best', 'also', 'loved', 'old', 'lady', 'especially', 'when', 'was', 'rapping', 'Sugar', 'Hill', 'Gang', 'rapper', 'delight', 'also', 'liked', 'seeing', 'Alexis', 'Arquette', 'always', 'trip', 'current', 'drag', 'queen', 'pre-op', 'transexual', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'nostalgic', 'throwback', 'very', 'cool', 'time', 'history', 'totally', 'awesome', '80', 'think', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'honoured', 'time', 'comedically', 'beautiful']",N/A
