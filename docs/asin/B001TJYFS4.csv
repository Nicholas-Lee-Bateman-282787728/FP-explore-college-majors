1236556,A2XFII4E73279L,B001TJYFS4,"Charles Justus Garard ""Charles J. Garard Jr. PhD""","[11, 16]","Wow. That this is a scary film is undeniable. To say that is is compelling and worthy of our attention is an understatement.Maybe people have their doubts about the predictions of Nostradamus, and this is understandable. I mean, how many of us really want to entertain the belief that the world, at least as we know it, is coming to an end in 2012? We would rather put our heads in the sand and tell ourselves that it could never happen -- at least in our lifetime. If we are in doubt about this particular prediction, we should examine the quatrains that he wrote predicting other world events. If none of them have occurred, then perhaps we can cease worrying. As Sherlock Holmes would say, let's look at the facts. Of course, we might also argue that his quatrains are so obscure at to be open to numerous interpretations, as are the many signs around the world which are subject to being decoded according to separate perspectives. Did he, as some have claimed, predict 9-11? Did he predict Hurricane Katrina and global warming?As this film points out, however, we cannot put all of this into the lap of the famous seer who lived at a time when making such predictions could put one in danger of being burned at the stake as a heretic. One did not then go against the beliefs and teachings of the Church. The Lollards, for example, often were burned at the stake like William Tyndale for merely wanting a version of the Holy Word in English instead of Latin. The Church in Rome opposed this because they feared a loss of control over the semi-educated masses in England. This film, to its credit, draws our attention not only to Nostradamus and to The Revelations of St. John in the Bible but to other prophecies that have been made since early times by the underrated star-gazing Mayans, the Egyptians, and the Hopis as well.Many people will have their own opinions about this program, so it is unlikely that anything I write will change their personal views. Some find it funny; some believe it is inaccurate. Many may even think it is foolish to look around to see what we are doing to our own planet. They will dismiss this, perhaps, as easily as they dismiss such films as THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, based on Whitley Streiber's and Art Bell's book THE COMING SUPERSTORM, as being only fiction.As my brother stated, this planet is a living entity and will, he believes, protect itself, even if it means disgorging itself of the beings that are inhabiting it and abusing it. My own suggestion would be to examine other books and DVDs on this topic now available through Amazon and to arrive at your own conclusions. If you can find a place to hide from our transgressions, then do so. Book a ticket to a flight away from here, or hope that some friendly aliens will rescue some of us, as is shown in the fictional film KNOWING. Some experts, if we wish to call them such, believe that this world will indeed undergo some dramatic changes, but that not all of us will necessarily perish. What we supposedly will see will be a new world, maybe one -- if the optimists are correct -- that will be occupied by people who don't feel the need to destroy each other and the very planet that has supported us for eons.If I have any complaints about this program, it would be that it lacks subtitles. Because I teach students whose first language is not English, it is a small detriment. That said, I cannot help but wonder how many teachers would actually show this program to their students. I wonder if do so would put them in jeopardy with school boards and administrators, even at colleges. Might they be treated to a modern version of being burned at the stake -- i.e., terminated -- their teaching contracts, I mean?",5,Scary but important stuff . . . definitely controversial,1252195200,"09 6, 2009",2009,3718,"['Wow', 'scary', 'film', 'undeniable', 'say', 'compelling', 'worthy', 'attention', 'understatement.Maybe', 'people', 'have', 'doubts', 'predictions', 'Nostradamus', 'understandable', 'mean', 'how', 'many', 'really', 'want', 'entertain', 'belief', 'world', 'least', 'know', 'coming', 'end', '2012', 'would', 'rather', 'put', 'heads', 'sand', 'tell', 'could', 'never', 'happen', 'least', 'lifetime', 'are', 'doubt', 'particular', 'prediction', 'should', 'examine', 'quatrains', 'wrote', 'predicting', 'other', 'world', 'events', 'none', 'have', 'occurred', 'then', 'perhaps', 'can', 'cease', 'worrying', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'would', 'say', 'let', 'look', 'facts', 'course', 'might', 'also', 'argue', 'quatrains', 'are', 'so', 'obscure', 'be', 'open', 'numerous', 'interpretations', 'are', 'many', 'signs', 'world', 'are', 'subject', 'being', 'decoded', 'according', 'separate', 'perspectives', 'Did', 'have', 'claimed', 'predict', '9-11', 'Did', 'predict', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'global', 'warming', 'film', 'out', 'however', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'lap', 'famous', 'seer', 'who', 'lived', 'time', 'when', 'making', 'such', 'predictions', 'could', 'put', 'one', 'danger', 'being', 'burned', 'stake', 'heretic', 'One', 'did', 'not', 'then', 'go', 'beliefs', 'teachings', 'Church', 'Lollards', 'example', 'often', 'were', 'burned', 'stake', 'William', 'Tyndale', 'merely', 'wanting', 'version', 'Holy', 'Word', 'English', 'instead', 'Latin', 'Church', 'Rome', 'opposed', 'feared', 'loss', 'control', 'semi-educated', 'masses', 'England', 'film', 'credit', 'attention', 'not', 'only', 'Nostradamus', 'Revelations', 'St.', 'John', 'Bible', 'other', 'prophecies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'early', 'times', 'underrated', 'star-gazing', 'Mayans', 'Egyptians', 'Hopis', 'well.Many', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'own', 'opinions', 'program', 'unlikely', 'anything', 'write', 'will', 'change', 'personal', 'views', 'find', 'believe', 'inaccurate', 'Many', 'may', 'even', 'think', 'foolish', 'look', 'see', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'own', 'planet', 'will', 'dismiss', 'perhaps', 'easily', 'dismiss', 'such', 'films', 'DAY', 'AFTER', 'TOMORROW', 'based', 'Whitley', 'Streiber', 'Art', 'Bell', 'book', 'THE', 'COMING', 'SUPERSTORM', 'being', 'only', 'fiction.As', 'brother', 'stated', 'planet', 'living', 'entity', 'will', 'protect', 'even', 'disgorging', 'beings', 'are', 'inhabiting', 'abusing', 'own', 'suggestion', 'would', 'be', 'examine', 'other', 'books', 'DVDs', 'topic', 'now', 'available', 'Amazon', 'arrive', 'own', 'conclusions', 'can', 'find', 'place', 'hide', 'transgressions', 'then', 'do', 'so', 'Book', 'ticket', 'flight', 'away', 'here', 'hope', 'friendly', 'aliens', 'will', 'rescue', 'shown', 'fictional', 'film', 'KNOWING', 'experts', 'wish', 'call', 'such', 'believe', 'world', 'will', 'indeed', 'undergo', 'dramatic', 'changes', 'not', 'will', 'necessarily', 'perish', 'What', 'supposedly', 'will', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'new', 'world', 'maybe', 'one', 'optimists', 'are', 'correct', 'will', 'be', 'occupied', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'destroy', 'other', 'very', 'planet', 'supported', 'eons.If', 'have', 'complaints', 'program', 'would', 'be', 'subtitles', 'teach', 'students', 'first', 'language', 'not', 'English', 'small', 'detriment', 'said', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'teachers', 'would', 'actually', 'show', 'program', 'students', 'wonder', 'do', 'so', 'would', 'put', 'jeopardy', 'school', 'boards', 'administrators', 'even', 'colleges', 'Might', 'be', 'treated', 'modern', 'version', 'being', 'burned', 'stake', 'i.e.', 'terminated', 'teaching', 'contracts', 'mean']",Nostradamus: 2012

The issue that I have with it (as with other documentaries) is that it strongly favors a lot of superstitious, end-of-the-world scenarios. The meaning of the Nostradamus quatrains is still heavily debated, since it is all in code and cannot necessarily be taken at face value. I enjoyed the documentary but it definitely gets one stirred up a bit.There's another documentary,2012: Science Or Superstition, that gives a bit more about world enlightenment, etc, rather than just strictly different ways Earth can get blown up. When it comes to the Mayan calendar theory, no one can even translate the Mayan language 100%, too much of the material has been destroyed.

1236560,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B001TJYFS4,Howard M. Kindel,"[2, 2]","Never underestimate man's capacity for self-destruction.  And, guess what?  Unlike any other time in human history, man finally has the means of annihilating almost all life on this planet - which makes 2012 a quantum leap ahead of any other ""End of Times"" prediction.  Not that I expect the world to end on December 21, 2012; but it wouldn't surprise me if 12/21/12 turned out to be a pivotal date in human history. Especially in light of global warming; or a shift in earth's magnetic field; or the involvement of too many nations in one or another of man's wars of choice; or the growing religious fervor sweeping the globe.  Of all these possible forces of potential destruction, I'd put my money on religious fervor.  I think there's far more to that kind of madness than meets the eye.  I think people get drawn into a religious vortex for reasons having more to do with social evolution than religious belief per se.  One of the things that struck me when I recently watched the PBS series ""Cosmos"" was Carl Sagan's observation that had the science of the Hellenistic period prevailed over the superstition of the Church during the Middle Ages, we would almost certainly have put a man on the moon a millenium ago.  I disagree.  I think, instead, we would almost certainly have put an end to human existence a millenium ago. Which makes me think that the evolutionary process itself contains the seeds of each species' survival as well as its destruction.  As abhorrent as religious fervor is, I believe it may well serve the evolutionary purpose of short-circuiting man's self-destructive impulse by censuring his scientific genius.  It took a thousand years for man to re-discover the science sent into hiding by religion.  Nature, I believe, through some evolutionary mechanism, is once again trying to bottle up man's genius before it's too late to save the species.  The problem is, it may already be too late.  When the Church last gained ascendancy, man had not yet created ""the Bomb.""  This time around he has.
