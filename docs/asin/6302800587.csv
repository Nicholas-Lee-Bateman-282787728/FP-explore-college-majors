This is a great movie because the subject matter is so intense at times and hilarious at some points too.  This movie kinda helped me deal with some of the issues covered in the movie, like his rocky relationship with his Mom.  My Dad and I had a similar relationship but it was a little more escalated.  If you are thinking of comming out, WATCH THIS FLICK!!!  It is also great to share with your family, that is if all of you are comfortable viewing this type of movie.  There is no nudity and does not have any scenes depicting drug use.  That is part of why I think this is a great movie because gays are not portrayed as addicts or sexual predators.

336352,AB9WCN34TY8CV,6302800587,Charles Sutherland,"[0, 0]","While this film is somewhat dated now, it does a very interesting job at showing gay relationships in emotional complexity -- the world of the drag queen, the world of those who are not quite out, and the problems faced by couples in terms of basic everyday human relationships.Arnold (Harvey Fierstein) is the central character, a drag-queen/playwright who is never quite accepted by his family (the mother, played by Anne Bancroft, is wonderfully performed).  He goes through a three-act story (Trilogy) showing his first encounters with Ed (Brian Kerwin), the not-quite-out school teacher; his long-term relationship with Alan (played by a very nervous looking Matthew Broderick) which ends in tragedy, and finally the adopted son/mother/reacquaintance with Ed.The one-liners are rattled off with ease, and the scenes are developed in fairly predictable yet well crafted ways.  This is a film derived from a stage play that, for the most part, predates the AIDS crisis, so this is not mentioned at all in the film.  It does deal with discrimination and violence in peripheral ways, but this isn't central to the story, except for the inter-family relationships, primarily with Arnold and his mother.A great film!",5,A three-act life,1085356800,"05 24, 2004",2004,1215,"['film', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'now', 'very', 'interesting', 'job', 'showing', 'gay', 'relationships', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'world', 'drag', 'queen', 'world', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'problems', 'faced', 'couples', 'terms', 'basic', 'everyday', 'human', 'relationships.Arnold', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'central', 'character', 'drag-queen/playwright', 'who', 'never', 'quite', 'accepted', 'family', 'mother', 'played', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'wonderfully', 'performed', 'three-act', 'story', 'Trilogy', 'showing', 'first', 'encounters', 'Ed', 'Brian', 'Kerwin', 'not-quite-out', 'school', 'teacher', 'long-term', 'relationship', 'Alan', 'played', 'very', 'nervous', 'looking', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'tragedy', 'finally', 'adopted', 'son/mother/reacquaintance', 'Ed.The', 'one-liners', 'are', 'rattled', 'off', 'ease', 'scenes', 'are', 'developed', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'yet', 'well', 'crafted', 'ways', 'film', 'derived', 'stage', 'play', 'most', 'part', 'AIDS', 'crisis', 'not', 'mentioned', 'film', 'deal', 'discrimination', 'violence', 'peripheral', 'ways', ""n't"", 'central', 'story', 'inter-family', 'relationships', 'primarily', 'Arnold', 'mother.A', 'great', 'film']",Torch Song Trilogy VHS

Taylor ""GFT""","[18, 19]","You don't have to be gay to love this surprising and unpretentious little movie, which should appeal to the hidden sense of ""outsider"" in most viewers. The story of an overweight, overly emotional, gravel-voiced and very unglamorous drag queen who seeks true love in a society that prizes appearance over values, TORCH SONG TRILOGY is a hilarious and often poignantly touching film with a break-out performance by Harvey Fierstein, who adapts his Tony-award winning stage script and performance for the screen with considerable aplomb.In addition to Fierstein's brilliantly honest script and self-depreciating performance, the film also offers knock-out performances by Anne Bancroft as Fierstein's Jewish-Mother-From-Hell and Matthew Broderick as his much younger and somewhat unlikely lover; although not in the same league with these three, supporting players Brian Kerwin strikes the right note as Fierstein's tepidly bisexual ex-lover and Karen Young is quite good as Kerwin's understandably neurotic wife.  Although the film script does depart from the stage script, it remains faithful in spirit, and the film as a whole is reasonably--although not outstandingly--served by director Paul Bogart.The film abounds with quotable lines (""I'm the pretty one"") that will keep you laughing, but although it concludes on a ""hope for the future"" note TORCH SONG TRILOGY is not all grins and giggles by a long shot: the dramatic underpinnings are deadly serious, and at least one or two scenes will leave most viewers as shocked, angered, and heart-broken as the characters it so vividly displays.  While the film isn't BOYS IN THE BAND, I think it is the only gay-themed film to date that actually approaches the artistic and emotional impact of BOYS IN THE BAND; more over, most viewers will probably find it more accessible, and many will be surprised to by a realization of much TORCH has influenced cinema's portrayal of gay characters from the 1980s right up to the present.

Adapted from his series of three plays, Torch Song Trilogy focuses on the life of Harvey's alter ego, Arnold Beckoff, a drag performer.  In chapter one, Arnold's career is moving along well, but he dreams of having a family of his own - a family who, unlike his parents, will love and respect Arnold for who he is.  Arnold meets Ed (the studly Brian Kerwin) in a bar, and they begin a relationship, but Ed, a self-identified bisexual, is not quite as comfortable with his gay side as Arnold would like.  Ed's internalized homophobia and desire to keep up an outwardly heterosexual image prove too much for the couple, and Arnold finds himself single again.In chapter two, Arnold becomes involved with Alan (Matthew Broderick), a former hustler now working as a model.  Arnold is leery of the handsome young man at first, but Alan's persistence wears him down, and the two become a couple.  The pairing is successful, to the point where they begin the process of adopting a child together.  Meanwhile, Ed has married a woman, who contacts Arnold and Alan, inviting them to spend a weekend in the country.  Tensions run high, with each of the foursome checking out the competition, and the weekend turns out to be eye-opening for all involved.  Back in the city, life appears to be working out for Arnold and Alan, but as the men prepare to bring their adopted son home, tragedy strikes, in the form of a gay bashing, and Arnold's world once again comes crashing down.Chapter three finds Arnold, his new 15-year-old gay son David, and now-separated houseguest Ed, preparing for a visit from Arnold's widowed mother (Anne Bancroft). Arnold and his mother finally let out all the anger and frustration that have built up over the years, battling over such basic issues as honesty, respect, and the devaluing of the emotions of others.  While many issues of their relationship are left unresolved, mother and son come to an understanding, and part with an increase in caring and respect for each other.  At the conclusion, Arnold is left to contemplate the joys and sorrows of the past, and the promise and possibilities of his future.This film is a gay touchstone.  No matter what stage of the coming out process you are in, the messages of self acceptance and standing up for your right to be loved and respected for who you are should be affirming and motivating.  Through Arnold's experiences, it is made clear that life is most fulfilling when you find your identity, choose your path, and insist that others deal with the real you, rather than allowing others to dictate your public persona.I just received my copy of the new DVD from Amazon, and I am very pleased with the release.  The copy I received is a widescreen transfer of a very good print, and is the same version of the film that I saw on the big screen.  In addition, the commentary track by the always-entertaining Harvey Fierstein is wonderful - filled with anecdotes about the history of the plays and film, tidbits and gossip about the film's cast and crew, and descriptions of scenes that were cut from the film due to time constraints.  I would love to have seen those deleted scenes and alternate takes included on the DVD, as well as existing footage of the original plays, and/or the award shows in which the stage productions were winners. These are minor quibbles, however - on the whole, the release is an excellent one, and I highly recommend it to those who are already fans of the film and of Harvey Fierstein, as well as to those who have not yet had the pleasure of seeing Torch Song Trilogy.",5,A welcome DVD release of a great film!,1083974400,"05 8, 2004",2004,3692,"['Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'classic', 'film', 'gay', 'man', 'funny', 'moving', 'quest', 'create', 'own', 'family', 'finally', 'DVD', 'Adapted', 'series', 'three', 'plays', 'Torch', 'Song', 'Trilogy', 'life', 'Harvey', 'alter', 'ego', 'Arnold', 'Beckoff', 'drag', 'performer', 'chapter', 'one', 'Arnold', 'career', 'moving', 'along', 'well', 'having', 'family', 'own', 'family', 'who', 'parents', 'will', 'love', 'respect', 'Arnold', 'who', 'Arnold', 'Ed', 'studly', 'Brian', 'Kerwin', 'bar', 'begin', 'relationship', 'Ed', 'self-identified', 'bisexual', 'not', 'quite', 'comfortable', 'gay', 'side', 'Arnold', 'would', 'like', 'Ed', 'internalized', 'homophobia', 'desire', 'keep', 'up', 'outwardly', 'heterosexual', 'image', 'prove', 'too', 'much', 'couple', 'Arnold', 'single', 'again.In', 'chapter', 'two', 'Arnold', 'involved', 'Alan', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'former', 'hustler', 'now', 'working', 'model', 'Arnold', 'leery', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'first', 'Alan', 'persistence', 'down', 'two', 'become', 'couple', 'pairing', 'successful', 'point', 'where', 'begin', 'process', 'adopting', 'child', 'together', 'Meanwhile', 'Ed', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'Arnold', 'Alan', 'inviting', 'spend', 'weekend', 'country', 'Tensions', 'run', 'high', 'foursome', 'checking', 'out', 'competition', 'weekend', 'out', 'be', 'eye-opening', 'involved', 'Back', 'city', 'life', 'be', 'working', 'out', 'Arnold', 'Alan', 'men', 'prepare', 'bring', 'adopted', 'son', 'home', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'form', 'gay', 'bashing', 'Arnold', 'world', 'once', 'again', 'crashing', 'down.Chapter', 'three', 'finds', 'Arnold', 'new', '15-year-old', 'gay', 'son', 'David', 'now-separated', 'houseguest', 'Ed', 'preparing', 'visit', 'Arnold', 'widowed', 'mother', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Arnold', 'mother', 'finally', 'let', 'out', 'anger', 'frustration', 'have', 'built', 'up', 'years', 'battling', 'such', 'basic', 'issues', 'honesty', 'respect', 'devaluing', 'emotions', 'others', 'many', 'issues', 'relationship', 'are', 'left', 'unresolved', 'mother', 'son', 'come', 'understanding', 'part', 'increase', 'caring', 'respect', 'other', 'conclusion', 'Arnold', 'left', 'contemplate', 'joys', 'sorrows', 'past', 'promise', 'possibilities', 'future.This', 'film', 'gay', 'touchstone', 'matter', 'what', 'stage', 'coming', 'out', 'process', 'are', 'messages', 'self', 'acceptance', 'standing', 'up', 'right', 'be', 'loved', 'respected', 'who', 'are', 'should', 'be', 'affirming', 'motivating', 'Arnold', 'experiences', 'made', 'clear', 'life', 'most', 'fulfilling', 'when', 'find', 'identity', 'choose', 'path', 'insist', 'others', 'deal', 'real', 'rather', 'allowing', 'others', 'dictate', 'public', 'persona.I', 'just', 'received', 'copy', 'new', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'release', 'copy', 'received', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'very', 'good', 'print', 'same', 'version', 'film', 'saw', 'big', 'screen', 'addition', 'commentary', 'track', 'always-entertaining', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'wonderful', 'filled', 'anecdotes', 'history', 'plays', 'film', 'tidbits', 'gossip', 'film', 'cast', 'crew', 'descriptions', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'film', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'seen', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'included', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'existing', 'footage', 'original', 'plays', 'and/or', 'award', 'stage', 'productions', 'were', 'winners', 'are', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'however', 'whole', 'release', 'excellent', 'one', 'highly', 'recommend', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'fans', 'film', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'Torch', 'Song', 'Trilogy']",Torch Song Trilogy VHS

Even though the movie is only two hours long-- the play was about four-- he captures the essence of this groundbreaking play. Although we previously had had BOYS IN THE BAND, THE STAIRCASE and similar plays/movies about gay people in America, no writer before had said (that I can recall) that gays should adopt children, gays should be monogamous, gays should be honest with themselves, their families and everybody else, gays had nothing to be ashamed of, gays were good people. Fierstein says all that and more in this most seminal work. When the history of the gay movement in the late 20th Century is written, this play/movie will be remembered with the likes of ANGELS IN AMERICA as lasting art. I saw the play on broadway years ago. It was the shortest four hours of my life. Both the play and the movie will make you laugh; they will make you cry.Of course Fierstein, who both wrote the screenplay and plays Arnold Beckoff a/k/a Virginia Ham, gets a tad dramatic at times and his addressing the audience works better on stage than in the film; and maybe the great actress Anne Bancroft overacts as his b----y mother. These are just table crumbs, however, from a magnificent visual feast.All the actors to a person are superb, and the soundtrack is worth owning--Fierstein, who sings his songs live, has a voice no lower than Marlene Dietrich's and just as good.Fierstein also does a commentary on the DVD of this film, offering interesting insights and tidbits about the making of TORCH SONG TRILOGY, a film you will want to see again and again.",5,Such A Fine Movie,1144195200,"04 5, 2006",2006,1633,"['Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'play', 'won', 'Tony', 'beautifully', 'screen', 'Even', 'movie', 'only', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'play', 'was', 'four', 'essence', 'groundbreaking', 'play', 'previously', 'had', 'had', 'BOYS', 'IN', 'THE', 'BAND', 'THE', 'STAIRCASE', 'similar', 'plays/movies', 'gay', 'people', 'America', 'writer', 'had', 'said', 'can', 'recall', 'should', 'adopt', 'children', 'gays', 'should', 'be', 'monogamous', 'gays', 'should', 'be', 'honest', 'families', 'everybody', 'else', 'gays', 'had', 'nothing', 'be', 'ashamed', 'gays', 'were', 'good', 'people', 'Fierstein', 'more', 'most', 'seminal', 'work', 'When', 'history', 'gay', 'movement', 'late', '20th', 'Century', 'written', 'play/movie', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'likes', 'ANGELS', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'lasting', 'art', 'saw', 'play', 'broadway', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'shortest', 'four', 'hours', 'life', 'play', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'will', 'make', 'cry.Of', 'course', 'Fierstein', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'plays', 'Arnold', 'Beckoff', 'Virginia', 'Ham', 'tad', 'dramatic', 'times', 'addressing', 'audience', 'better', 'stage', 'film', 'maybe', 'great', 'actress', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'b', 'y', 'mother', 'are', 'just', 'table', 'crumbs', 'however', 'magnificent', 'visual', 'feast.All', 'actors', 'person', 'are', 'superb', 'soundtrack', 'worth', 'owning', 'Fierstein', 'who', 'songs', 'live', 'voice', 'lower', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'just', 'good.Fierstein', 'also', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'film', 'offering', 'interesting', 'insights', 'tidbits', 'making', 'TORCH', 'SONG', 'TRILOGY', 'film', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'again']",Torch Song Trilogy VHS

If you are not familiar with this film, it is a must see. A delightful, funny, gentle and moving film. For those not familiar, to put it in the context of time, it was one of the first movies with a positive image of gay characters.I go way back with Torch Song. In the 1970's I saw, ""International Stud"" in the Village (I believe it was a theatre on Bleecker St.) I also remember seeing it as an entire triology off off Broadway when it was presented by the Glines (I seem to remember that the ticket cost $5 with a coupon, or was it 2-for $10 with coupon?)Harvey Fierstien is to be applauded. We take for granted the more positive image we see of gays today (although apparently, we have progressed from the film images of where we kill ourselves, to the television images of where we are only acceptable if we are making straight people happy  and so that they can marry each other, while we ourselves are not allowed to get married).Torch Song represents hope, love, and pride.A big plus on the DVD is the not to be missed commentary by Harvey.Thank you Harvey for writing this.

Estelle Getty did this play on Broadway and it was this story and all the friends she made that made her a lifelong supporter of gay rights and AIDS research. It's only too bad I didn't get to see her in the movie since I didn't get to see the play. Anne Bancroft played a very strong mother to Harvey Fierstein's gay son, however, and their relationship was heartbreaking. I know people with relationships like that because the parent (or friend or whoever) just won't understand, and I wish those people would watch a movie like this with an open mind. But not only will they not watch it with an open mind, they won't watch it at all!I think the final third of the movie (Arnold's  relationship with his mother) had the biggest impact on me and was the part of the movie I enjoyed the most, even though it just about made me cry. I was almost ready to believe that Arnold was about to get through his mother's thick head when he described his pain at the loss of his partner (after she said how dare he compare his loss to her husband!), but alas, no. Too bad.I don't know why this was rated R. A few bad words but that was about it. No icky sex scenes (that they think sell movies but a lot of us really don't want to watch).

Fierstein is at his campy best, and captivates with his heartfelt portrayal of an  aging drag queen searching for love before it's too late.  I forgot to  breathe during the cemetery scene, where Arnold's strained relationship  with his mother reaches critical mass.

336378,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,6302800587,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","A notable film on several levels. First, it was way ahead of the U.S. in being a relatively mainstream film that treated gay men as people of depth,value, humor and worth making a film about. (Although there is sad irony in the fact this huge hit play took so long to make it to the screen thatAIDS had already totally altered the landscape by the time of its release. That's something the film only notes in the closing credits, and gives it abit of a 'rose colored glasses' hue).But beyond any politics or social significance this is also a very well acted, funny and moving look at one man, Arnold, (played by the unique andcharismatic Harvey Firestein, who wrote the play and screenplay) as he looks for love &#8211; both romantic and familial in a sometimes very cold world.If Firestein's performance can occasionally feel theatrical, it's also entirely appropriate for the starting-to-age drag queen performer he plays.What's wonderful is how Firestein always keeps the humanity under Arnold's occasional flamboyance very alive, as does Anne Bancroft as his'difficult' mother. Later in her career Bancroft could tend towards theatricality on screen as well, but she tones it down just enough to feel realhere, and anyway, lets face it, next to a drag queen, who is more innately dramatic than a Jewish mother? (I grew up with one, trust me).Matthew Broderick and Brian Kerwin also do very good work in support, Broderick as a sexy but understated young man totally at ease with hissexuality, and Kerwin as a confused bi- sexual trying to work out his. While never rising to the level of a great film (the direction is verystraightforward and bland, there's almost a TV movie look to it, it never completely surpasses it's theatrical origins), it's certainly a good, touching,human, and important one &#8211; although to a generation growing up with the reality of gay marriage and deeper integration of gay people intosociety, some of the historical importance may be lost. But not the essential, timeless embrace of kindness, love, respect and understanding.",4,"Touching, funny, sad and important",1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,2065,"['notable', 'film', 'several', 'levels', 'First', 'was', 'way', 'ahead', 'U.S.', 'being', 'relatively', 'mainstream', 'film', 'treated', 'gay', 'men', 'people', 'depth', 'value', 'humor', 'worth', 'making', 'film', 'sad', 'irony', 'fact', 'huge', 'hit', 'play', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'make', 'screen', 'thatAIDS', 'had', 'already', 'totally', 'altered', 'landscape', 'time', 'release', 'something', 'film', 'only', 'closing', 'credits', 'abit', ""'rose"", 'colored', 'glasses', 'hue', 'politics', 'social', 'significance', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'funny', 'moving', 'look', 'one', 'man', 'Arnold', 'played', 'unique', 'andcharismatic', 'Harvey', 'Firestein', 'who', 'wrote', 'play', 'screenplay', 'love', '8211', 'romantic', 'familial', 'sometimes', 'very', 'cold', 'world.If', 'Firestein', 'performance', 'can', 'occasionally', 'feel', 'theatrical', 'also', 'entirely', 'appropriate', 'starting-to-age', 'drag', 'queen', 'performer', 'plays.What', 'wonderful', 'how', 'Firestein', 'always', 'humanity', 'Arnold', 'occasional', 'flamboyance', 'very', 'alive', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', ""his'difficult"", 'mother', 'Later', 'career', 'Bancroft', 'could', 'tend', 'towards', 'theatricality', 'screen', 'as', 'well', 'down', 'just', 'enough', 'feel', 'realhere', 'anyway', 'face', 'next', 'drag', 'queen', 'who', 'more', 'innately', 'dramatic', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'grew', 'up', 'one', 'trust', '.Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Brian', 'Kerwin', 'also', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'work', 'support', 'Broderick', 'sexy', 'understated', 'young', 'man', 'totally', 'ease', 'hissexuality', 'Kerwin', 'confused', 'bi-', 'sexual', 'trying', 'work', 'out', 'never', 'rising', 'level', 'great', 'film', 'direction', 'verystraightforward', 'bland', 'almost', 'TV', 'movie', 'look', 'never', 'completely', 'theatrical', 'origins', 'certainly', 'good', 'touching', 'human', 'important', 'one', '8211', 'generation', 'growing', 'up', 'reality', 'gay', 'marriage', 'deeper', 'integration', 'gay', 'people', 'intosociety', 'historical', 'importance', 'may', 'be', 'lost', 'not', 'essential', 'timeless', 'embrace', 'kindness', 'love', 'respect', 'understanding']",Torch Song Trilogy VHS

336381,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6302800587,Linda Linguvic,"[5, 6]","Writen by and starring Harvey Fierstein, this 1988 film was adapted from the stage play.  It's set in the New York world of gays in the 1970s, before AIDS.  But even then, life was certainly not bliss for Harvey Fierstein.  From early childhood Harvey knew he was different.  As an adult, he works as a feminine impersonator and has accepted himself, but every day he has to confront his gayness.  He uses humor to cover up his hurts and that's why this film can be considered a comedy as well as a drama.  But even though I laughed out loud at certain points, it is still a poignant and moving story of an individual's search for love and respect.There are two men in Harvey's life.  One is Ed, a bisexual who can't quite come to terms with living as a gay man.  He actually gets married and Harvey and the new ""love of his life"", Alan, played by Mathew Broderick are invited for a visit.  Naturally there are complications.  But the two men resolve them, move to a new apartment and make plans to adopt a 15-year old gay boy.  It's then that tragedy strikes and Alan is viciously murdered.The most important relationship, however, is Harvey's relationship with his mother, played by Ann Brancroft.  She's supposed to be Jewish with all the Jewish stereotypical expressions.  Sorry, but I didn't get it.  She comes across as a caricature rather than a real person.  And, had she played the role better, I might even have had a small amount of sympathy for her.  This didn't happen.  All I did was be amused as she tried to act Jewish.  It's a good role. It just needed a better actress.With the exception of Ann Bankcroft's acting, I really liked this film.  Harvey Fierstein is outstanding and it clear that the role comes straight from his heart.  The rest of the cast did a good job and the cinematography was good. As a side note, part of this movie was filmed across the street from where I live.  I even remember when they were filming it.  It depicts the neighborhood as a dangerous one.  That is not true at all.  But, after all, this is the movies.I definitely recommend Torch Song Trilogy and give it a high recommendation.  It depicts a time and a place in the world of gay men that has unfortunately ended when AIDS came on the scene.  I just wish that the casting would have been better for the mother's role.",4,Poignant and moving story.  It's also a comedy.

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[26, 26]","In 1988, the film version of the Tony Award-winning, landmark play ""Torch Song Trilogy"", which was written by the outspoken and very witty Harvey Fierstein, was released to theaters.  Written originally as three separate one-act plays between 1978 and 1979 (""The International Stud"", ""Fugue in a Nursery"" and ""Widows and Children First""), Harvey Fierstein combined them into the more familiar three-act play ""Torch Song Trilogy"" in 1981 since each one-act play focused on the life of a gay man named Arnold (played by Harvey Fierstein), who is a gay drag-show entertainer.  In the first act, Arnold meets a stranger at a bar named Ed (Brian Kerwin). A precarious relationship develops quickly between Ed and Arnold, but Ed also wants to marry a woman named Laurel (Karen Young).  In the second act, Arnold meets a young man named Alan (Matthew Broderick) at the club where Arnold performs.  A long-term relationship develops between Arnold and Alan until an unexpected tragedy occurs.  The third act focuses on Arnold taking care of a teenaged son, David (Eddie Castrodad) that he & Alan had adopted, as well as Arnold's ongoing difficulties with his mother (Anne Bancroft).With excellent dialog, engaging personalities and superb acting, ""Torch Song Trilogy"" is a fantastic film, demonstrating not only the love that exists within gay couples, but also the very real difficulties that many gay men face in their daily lives, including the all-too-often difficulties with family members who cannot accept them for who they are.  Harvey Fierstein's unique voice adds a special flare to his drag show performances, as well as to his arguments with his mother.  Anne Bancroft's performance is superb and emotional.  Matthew Broderick did a wonderful portraying Alan.  Interestingly, he had played the teenaged son David when ""Torch Song Trilogy"" was being performed on stage as a play.  Brian Kerwin and Karen Young also portray their roles well.  Other significant characters in the film include Bertha Venation (Charles Pierce), Marina Del Rey (Alex Vera), the young Arnold (Benji Schulman) and Murray (Kevin Page).  Overall, I rate ""Torch Song Trilogy"" with 5 out of 5 stars.

The movie starts humourously with the mother's discovery of the son hiding in a closet and trying to beautifying himself with her make-up. The mother yelled, ""What are you doing in the ---"". Then the mother knew what was going on.The movie can be basically divided into three parts (that's why it's titled trilogy) - his career as a professional drag queen (or politically correct - a female impersonator), during which he knew a bisexual man; his falling in love with a middle class boy who is still uncontaminated by the world. He, however, was sadly, killed by hateful discrimination. Finally, the movie has a touch of adopting a (gay) son and brings out the issue of gay parenting. The movie ends with a fight, not a reconciliation, between the mother and the gay son. Each part of the movie tells you the life and the bumpy road Arnold was living through at the moment. The movie does not depict it in a pitiful way, or else, it lets the plot bring out the emotio spontaneously to the audience. The dialogues are clever, symbolic and witty. The acting is professional and does not go over the top. The director deals with the fantastic scripts carefully and the final scene of Arnold holding the three most valuable things in his life in a chair is simply self-effacing.Torch Song Trilogy is a gay classic drama.

Based on the stage play of the same name and written by Harvey Fierstein, this was one of the first films to honestly portray homosexuals in a positive and honest light. Harvery plays Arnold, a drag queen, who meets a young, beautiful man, played to perfection by Matthew Broderick, and they eventually fall in love and ""adopt"" a young man. The jist of the story is between Arnold and his Jewish/Catholic mother, who doesn't approve of her son's homosexual lifestyle. The scenes between Harvey and Anne Bancroft, who plays his mother, are written to perfection, as these scenes are honest in their portrayal of a mother who wants her son to be straight and have a nice home, wife, and children, yet when the mother realizes this will never be, strong, confrontational encounters between mother and son erupt. Everything about the movie from the other characters and scenes are excellent, but its the chemistry between Bancroft and Fierstein that makes the movie work.I first saw this movie while in college, and have waited years for its release on DVD, and it's finally here. We all should watch this movie, not just for sheer enjoyment, but for good, educational reasons as we discover all families have issues, and families with gay sons are no different. The message here is that gay people cannot change. The problem isn't with the person who's gay, but with the parent who doesn't accept their child's homosexuality.There is also a fantastic commentary from Harvey on the making of the film, and the movie is in widescreen format, and is digitally remastered from the original studio print.

336396,A8ZTPTLGC4755,6302800587,Terry,"[0, 0]","I can't tell you how much I love Torch Song Trilogy.  I can honestly say I love this more than Brokeback Mountain.  Now before anyone starts ragging on me, I'll tell you why.  Trilogy shows that gay people are just as vulnerable to hurt, joy, and humanity as straight people.  Fierstein's character isn't afraid to take on the world even when it is hostile and violent toward him.  He displays strength and compassion and never loses his sense of humor, no matter how despairing and bleak it gets.  Now don't get me wrong, I love BBM but Arnold Beckoff has strength and resilience in a way that Ennis Del Mar could only dream of.  Mountain was a wonderful film but like all major gay love stories it always has to end tragically with the death of one of the characters.  Trilogy showed that while Arnold experienced the loss of a loved one, he also fought and gained an old flame who finally came to his senses.  It would be nice for mainstream gay themed films to have characters that are unafraid to take on the world and fight for that respect.  Instead we get gay characters who are the subjects of ill humor or tragedies that make people think twice about falling in love.  I can also add that this is one of the better films of the overblown 1980s (I also believe the 80s was probably one of the worst decades for movies).",5,One of the best of the 80s,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,1328,"['ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'Torch', 'Song', 'Trilogy', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'love', 'more', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Now', 'anyone', 'ragging', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'why', 'Trilogy', 'gay', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'vulnerable', 'hurt', 'joy', 'humanity', 'straight', 'people', 'Fierstein', 'character', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'take', 'world', 'even', 'when', 'hostile', 'violent', 'strength', 'compassion', 'never', 'sense', 'humor', 'matter', 'how', 'despairing', 'bleak', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'BBM', 'Arnold', 'Beckoff', 'strength', 'resilience', 'way', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'could', 'only', 'dream', 'Mountain', 'was', 'wonderful', 'film', 'major', 'gay', 'love', 'stories', 'always', 'end', 'tragically', 'death', 'one', 'characters', 'Trilogy', 'showed', 'Arnold', 'experienced', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'also', 'fought', 'gained', 'old', 'flame', 'who', 'finally', 'came', 'senses', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'mainstream', 'gay', 'themed', 'films', 'have', 'characters', 'are', 'unafraid', 'take', 'world', 'fight', 'respect', 'Instead', 'get', 'gay', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'subjects', 'ill', 'humor', 'tragedies', 'make', 'people', 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'falling', 'love', 'can', 'also', 'add', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'overblown', '1980s', 'also', 'believe', '80s', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'worst', 'decades', 'movies']",Torch Song Trilogy VHS

What is also important is that the widescreen is anamorphic.  Even better is that the film has been beautifully restored, and the transfer is great for a film of its year (1988).
