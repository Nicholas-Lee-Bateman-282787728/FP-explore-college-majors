The first season is the only one so far released on DVD, and it is great!  Never content with being just another sitcom about working class buddies, the Drew Carey Show pushed the bounds of humor and occasionally good taste in its nine seasons on ABC.The original opening music, &#34;Moon Over Parma&#34;, is the only opening music in this season, and brings back fond memories every time I see it.  This season introduces the whole gang, and Drew's nemesis and foil, Mimi Bobeck, in the office working for Drew's boss.  Drew's frustration with his almost meaningless job, troubles dating, and his attempts to claw his way up the corporate ladder provide much of the humor, but his friends Kate (who has dating troubles of her own), Oswald (who just gets odder as the show goes on) and Lewis (who may be criminally insane...or not) all have their share of the spotlight.A three episode arc in the middle of the season has Drew and his employer being sued for sexual harassment over a funny cartoon.  As is often the case, he's his own worst enemy in the run-up to his day in court, but throughout it's funny, very very funny.  Look for Penn and Teller as weaselly attorneys in the second ep of the arc.  Watch any episode of this season, and you should find yourself laughing loud and hard, and looking forward to the next episode on the disc.Most pilot episodes look like a work in progress, and don't always hit the mark.  The pilot for The Drew Carey Show is both hilarious and consistent with later episodes.  The cast already has chemistry, and honestly are the kind of people I'd love to hang out with at a tavern just like the Warsaw that is their watering hole.Bottom line is that this is one hilarious show.  If you're easily offended, watch a couple of episodes, and  you'll probably get over it.  Excellent inaugural season, and the ones that followed were also very good for the most part.  This is before the epic musical numbers that made their way into the show, or before the contest episodes.Can't wait for Season Two!

I am living in Germany at the moment and I watched the show every single day when I lived in the U.S., and even taped most of the episodes so I could watch them over and over again! I loved it so much and was so disappointed when we went overseas and I couldn't see it anymore (I moved right before the finale) and now it's FINALLY out on DVD and I can have it - I am so happy!I quickly lost interest in most popular television shows because the humor was very fake and forced. This show is about your average every-man and a kaleidescope of hilarious friends and colorful nemesis, and all the ""adventures"" they go through together. I have yet to meet someone who has actually sat through a full episode of this show and not adored it; everyone finds the humor fresh, unique, and very real. Oftentimes they will have outtakes from the episode playing during the credits (although I'm not sure if they do in the first season) and you can see that even the actors can't get through it without laughing - everything is SO funny and enjoyable!This show is also more than great laughs. The casting is also genius: you can't help but love Drew Carey because it is all too easy to relate to his problems and sense of humor - a very un-romanticized portrait of what it means to have a mundane job! His buddies Lewis (Ryan Stiles) and Oswald (Diedrick Bader) brilliantly adopt silly, idiotic characters with charm and perfect comedic timing. Mimi (Kathy Kinney) is his rival - and don't judge a book by its cover! She is a ruthlessly funny enemy who gets the biggest kick out of playing pranks on Drew; or as she calls him, ""the pig."" Her excessive makeup and outlandish clothing only add to the hilarity of her character. As for HUGE super-fans of Mr. Wick (Drew's second boss who stays for the remainder of the show's run) don't despair - he isn't in the first season, but he arrives in the very second episode of the following season. He is fantastic as well.Fans, please buy this show so the rest of the seasons come out all the quicker!

1045978,AY2WLFER9C9A,B000MGBLFK,"Mark Schaefer ""themarkman99""","[60, 64]","What's WRONG with you people! Don't you reconize a funny, smart, brilliant, over-the-top hilarous TV show when you see one?! I can't believe people praise ""Seinfeld"" for being inventive and revolutionary when this show kicks it's A*S!Jerry Seinfeld is about as funny as a bag of toenail clippings! The Drew Carey Show blows Seinfeld out of the water, and then some! Everyone on this show is hilarous, and it's not a comedy all of the time. Sometimes there's drama when Drew has just been dumped by a women, or when he loses his job, or any of the miscellanious things life throws at us. Here's info about the show and the characters you're going to love and relate to:Drew Allison Carey (Drew Carey) - The protagonist. Forty-something assistant director of personnel at a department store in Cleveland. He's very much the lovable loser, though it should be noted that he's the most successful of his group of friends. Original founder and owner of Buzz Beer (a special brew the gang makes containing coffee and beer. The brewery is in Drew's garage). A perpetual ""nice guy."" Has a long-standing feud with Mimi Bobeck, aspects of which include: Destroying Mimi's clothes, shredding her vacation requests and masquerading as Antonio Banderas to taunt her.Lewis Kiniski (Ryan Stiles) - Forms a double-act with Oswald. Lewis is the tall, lanky, blond, insane one. Lewis can be counted on to nonchalantly say bizarre and offensive things. He possesses an IQ of 180. He's a janitor in his forties that works for a company called DrugCo. He notes in one episode that due to accidentally releasing a virus into the population he was busted down to janitor from a position that required he wear a labcoat. It's uncertain if he was a scientist or lab assistant, though it's possible he was joking. At one point he posed as Drew to take his physical for him, and inadvertently ended up taking a psychiatric exam as well. The results showed him to mentally unstable, possibly criminally insane.Oswald Lee Harvey (Diedrich Bader) - Lewis's slightly shorter, dark-haired friend, is the dumb one of the double-act. That tends to be his only distinguishing characteristic. Lewis described him once as a ""man-child stuck in a state of prolonged adolescence."" At one point he was training to be a nurse, but he proved unsuitable. Oswald was a deejay in the first season, but later he became a delivery driver for Global Parcel (a UPS ripoff made for the show).Kate O'Brien (Christa Miller) - Friends with Drew, Lewis and Oswald since they were kids. Kate's main characteristic is that she's a bit of a tramp, and a hothead. She and Oswald almost got married at one point, but she called it off just after Oswald threw her a surprise wedding (essentially leaving Oswald at the altar). Kate found out about Drew's long-standing crush on her at their high school reunion, and realized that she had feelings for him too. They dated for a season (even becoming engaged), but broke up when they disagreed about having kids. Drew and Kate were married for a short time in a later season, although this was illegal, as Drew had just become married to his old girlfriend Nicki. Eventually, Drew's sham was discovered and Kate felt incredibly betrayed. It took Drew a long time, but he eventually regained Kate's trust and they went back to being friends. Kate left at the begining of the eighth season, marrying a Marine and moving out of Cleveland.Nigel Wick (Craig Ferguson) - Drew's boss after the first season, replacing the never-seen Mr. Bell. Crude, boisterous and offensive. He was also a cocaine addict before he was forced to go into rehab. Wick dominated every scene he was in and was the focal point of the show for a while. For some time, he and Drew were in a homosexual marriage (technically a civil union) in order for Mr. Wick to get his Green Card and Drew to get his job back. When he first appeared on stage in guest episodes in the last two seasons he was greeted with thunderous applause. Wick always had unusual methods of firing employees (and always fired someone named Johnson.)Mimi Bobeck (Kathy Kinney) - Mr. Bell's, later Mr. Wick's, assistant. She is an overweight woman who wears a lot of make-up. However she has very high self-esteem and is Drew's arch-nemesis. Mimi vowed to make Drew's life a living hell after Drew denied her a job based on her makeup. Mimi's pranks included gluing Drew's hand to a porno magazine, covering Drew's desk with garbage and eventually sending Drew to China. Her character can be seen as an attack on societal norms of beauty, much as the main character of Rosalie Goes Shopping is. Later on she becomes more of a friend to Drew (they agree to put their feud on hold while Mimi dates/marries Steve) and a good, if unconventional, mother to Gus.Steve Carey (John Carrol Lynch) - Drew's crossdressing brother. He came to Cleveland and got a job in the cosmetics department in the same store Drew works at. He falls in love with Mimi and they eventually get married. In later seasons the concept of Steve being a crossdresser is abandoned entirely with little explanation (though it is hinted that he gave it up to make Mimi happy). He leaves, along with Kate and Wick, during the early seventh season.Kellie Newmark (Cynthia Watros) - An old friend of Drew's from high-school. She was a housewife who was left by her husband. When Drew met up with her again she was working as a stripper. She took Kate's place on the show, but the character was much different. Kellie was probably the only genuinely nice person on the show, and was horrified at many of the goings-on that our characters had come to take for granted. She was also the only liberal character on the show, the others either being libertarian (as is Drew Carey), South Park Republican, or completely oblivious to the world of politics.The Drew Carey Show ran for nine years. Like many shows with long runs, the show's run can be broken down into several generally-agreed upon ""eras"".""Moon Over Parma""/Chemistry Titles Era (1995-1996)The first season of The Drew Carey Show was significantly different from the rest of the series. Drew and Mimi worked under a Mr. Bell, who existed only as a voice on Drew's speakerphone. Other characters who appeared exclusively in this era were Drew's hillbilly neighbor Jules and his family. Drew's first girlfriend Lisa was introduced in this season, though she stayed with the cast for the early episodes of the next season. Many of the episode titles were related to chemistry in some way. No explanation for this was ever given, and the tradition was abandoned at the end of the season. Buzz Beer, beer that had caffeine and tasted like coffee, was invented by the main characters in the last episode of the first season. The concept stayed with the series until the very end.Wick Era (1996-2002)The second season was notably different from the first. The opening theme ""Moon Over Parma"" was replaced by ""Five O'Clock World"" by The Vogues, which itself was later replaced with ""Cleveland Rocks"" by The Presidents of the United States of America. This also introduced the concept of the music video-like opening as the cast danced and sang around the various sets of the show. In the first episode Mr. Bell was fired, in the second episode he was replaced by Nigel Wick. Nigel Wick was one of the show's most outrageous characters. Like Lewis he had a tendency to slip truly bizarre or patently offensive things into casual conversation. Nigel Wick, however, was nowhere near as staid as Lewis. Nigel Wick was probably the first British character to appear on an American sitcom who wasn't an upper-class, refined stiff. That is, he was crude, boisterous and offensive.Lisa and Drew moved in together early in the second season, but it didn't work out. But this allowed the introduction of Speedy, Drew's dog who stayed throughout the end of the series. Steve, Drew's cross-dressing brother, was introduced during this period. He quickly fell in love with Mimi and they had a child, Gus.Drew was promoted several times, taking away Wick's job. However Wick always managed to return and take Drew's job back from him. At the end of this era Wick and Drew were co-managers of the Winfred Louder department store. Drew was also fired once, but got his job back by ""marrying"" Wick in Vermont, allowing him to get his green card. This was also the era in which series regular Kate and Drew got romantically involved. They were on the verge of getting married, but they called it off when they realized they didn't feel the same about the prospect of children.This era of the show is generally considered to be the show's best era, and the most recognizable. This era of the show was also known for its special events episodes. Virtually every season had two such episodes: ""What's Wrong With This Episode?"" and ""Drew Live"". The first contained a large number of mistakes, the person who could compile the largest list and phone them in would win a prize. The second was a live show that was recorded four-times over for each time zone, heavily featuring cast members from ""Whose Line is it Anyway?"" because of their improvisational skill. There was also the season 5 finale ""A Very Special Drew"" in which the cast indulged in manipulative and syrupy melodrama in an attempt to get an Emmy nomination.By far the most extreme was the Drew Carey's Back-to-School Rock 'n' Roll Comedy Hour which was shown a few weeks before the first episode of the 2001 season. The show was a series of sketches which was far closer in content and tone to Saturday Night Live or MADtv than The Drew Carey Show.Neverending Store Era (2002-2004)In the fall of 2002 the show returned, but it had become obvious to the producers that the formula was wearing thin. The concept of Winfred Louder and the characters' jobs there was abandoned completely. Show openings alternated with remixes of the previous theme songs, credits, and logo, however the opening was still a montage of various moments from past seasons of the show. The new concept involves Drew getting a job at the company that rented the building occupied by Winfred Louder, an internet start-up department store called ""Neverending Store"". Mimi gets a job as well, and Mr. Wick gets the only job he's qualified for -- janitor. However, Wick stopped appearing all together after a few episodes; Steve was also phased out in the same way. The most notable change, however, was when Kate O'Brien, one of the show's main cast, left. She was quickly replaced with Kellie, an old high school friend of Drew's who had been working as a stripper.Drew's bosses were a set of twenty-something internet geeks. The combination of high intelligence, low social skills, and hacker naivete created a very different sort of humor for the show. However they weren't the main focus. Like in the first season, Drew's life outside the office took center-stage once again.Tony The Bus-Driver became a main fixture, appearing in virtually every episode of the last two seasons. He typically played a role similar to a smart-alecky bartender that Drew could tell his problems to. (One of the first lines he uttered in the series: ""There's only one reason a man doesn't want to go home at the end of the day: ugly children."")In the eighth season Drew decided that he would get married a year from the date he set; a day which would coincide with the last episode of the season. Drew wouldn't make the deadline, but he would realize in the process that he was in love with Kellie. The eighth season was put in a dead timeslot on Monday nights. It was yanked mid-season and the remaining episodes were shown during the summer. In what was almost assuredly a unique event, ABC was forced to finance a ninth season, even though they had effectively canceled the show. The ninth season did not show during the fall of 2003, but ended up getting shown in the summer of 2004.Drew's last season felt very different from the rest of the show. ABC left the cast and crew alone as they made the season, since it seemed they never intended to show it. The directors started experimenting with one-camera set-ups, showing that the sets were completely built, there actually were fourth walls in most rooms, and the rooms were actually linked together. The writers were equally brazen, as they had Gus burn down Mimi's house, forcing her to move in with Drew. Drew and Mimi's mutual hatred of each other finally vanished and they became true friends.The season ended with Drew getting Wick's help to open up a department store, using the vacated building that Neverending Store left behind. However, Drew is quickly kicked out of his job as store manager by Wick, who has been given his job by the project's sole investor: his father-in-law. Mimi is also relieved of her vice-presidency and made Mr. Wick's assistant, Drew becomes the assistant director of personnel. Drew goes and sits at his desk, the surroundings are now the same as the Winfred Louder set that hadn't been seen for two years, and Barry Manilow's ""Looks Like We Made It"" starts up.The actual final episode follows as Drew and Kellie's first child is born, scant moments after the two are married. The final scene is Drew playing pool on his backyard pool table in the rain; the same scene that ended the first episode. He looks up at the camera and thanks the audience, saying it has been fun. The series ends with a montage set to ""You Can Still Rock in America"".Thank You for your time, cheers!",5,"""The Drew Carey Show"" be underrated NO MORE!!!",1127520000,"09 24,

The show is trying to find it's footing and the characters are starting to flesh out.  Drew himself pretty much remains the same as he does throughout the series, but others, especially Mimi (Kathy Kinney), evolve.  The series focuses on life of the working stiffs who live for the weekend and work at dead end jobs.  The pilot episode finds Mimi applying for a job in the cosmetic section and although she has some heavy application of eye shadow, her character isn't as garish both fashion wise and cosmetic wise as she would become.  She accuses Drew of discrimination and calls him a pig which would become a staple of the series.  Drew eventually gives the job to his best friend Kate (Christa Miller) and the series is set in motion.  Other notable differences in the first season is that there is no Mr. Wick, the store manager is an unseen Mr. Bell (voiced by Kevin Pollock) who torments Drew via intercom.  Lewis (Ryan Stiles) and Oswald (Dietrich Bader) are along as Drew's friends.  Buzz Beer doesn't make it's debut until the final episode, but it will become an integral part of the show.

Lovable loser Drew Carey (Himself) lives his middle-life years in Cleveland, Ohio as the mild-mannered assistant director of personnel of the multinational department store chain Winfred-Louder. Drew spends much of his days dealing with his cranky cosmetics-challenged co-worker Mimi (Kathy Kinney) and hanging out with his close friends Kate (Christa Miller), Oswald (Diedrich Bader) and Lewis (Ryan Stiles) in the local tavern. ""The Drew Carey Show"" is the very funny comedy sitcom that debuted on the ABC network in the fall of 1995. The first season features some amusing episodes with a terrific comic cast and side-splitting laughs. Adult viewers might relate to the characters mid-life issues. The onscreen rivalry between Carey and Kinney is utterly hilarious. The first season of ""The Drew Carey Show"" also includes Kevin Pollack (The Usual Suspects) as Drew's sexist and unseen boss Mr. Bell, and guest appearances by David Cross, Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis and Penn & Teller.Experience again all the laughs from one of the funniest comedy shows in recent television history with ""The Drew Carey Show: The Complete First Season"". All 22 episodes of the first season are presented in their original full screen format. The picture quality is quite good and certainly sharper than your average television rebroadcast. Its 2.0 Dolby Digital audio is well balanced and rather enjoyable. The only extras in the 4-disc set are the 19-minute ""Life inside a Cubicle"" featurette and the ""1-900-Mimi"" parody.

""I [would have] wanted to have some crummy, white-collar-type job where I COULD be in charge, but I'm not,"" Carey said.Although unfulfilled professionally, Drew is sustained by his longstanding friendship with pals Oswald (Diedrich Bader), Lewis (Ryan Stiles), and Kate (Christa Miller). While the four pals all find humor in being losers - a fact typically pointed out by Drew's cosmetics-challenged co-worker/arch enemy Mimi (Kathy Kinney) - only Drew cares about getting ahead on the job, but his prospects are few and fleeting.Like the rest of us, according to producer Bruce Helford, Drew's trying to juggle a life and a career and get through the day with a bit of dignity left. He takes his lumps, then goes home and feels better by hanging out with his pals at the Warsaw tavern. For me and my friends, it's the local IHOP. Initially branded as yet another one of the manyFriendsclone shows to appear during its freshman season (1995-1996), The Drew Carey Show immediately stood out from the pack with its unique brand of humor, going on to become one of ABC's longer-running hit comedies (9 seasons). It's good to see the show finally packaged in a season set DVD release. Hopefully, the first of many to come.The Drew Carey Show - The Complete First Season is a 4-disc (489 min.) set featuring all 22 episodes in Full Frame (1.33:1) video, plus the following Special Features: ""1-900-MIMI"" and ""Life Inside a Cubicle"" featurette.Episodes include:1. ""Pilot""Between best friend Kate and hostile Mimi (who threatens to go to his boss), pressure to fill a cosmetics-counter job has Drew a shade irascible.2. ""Miss Right""Drew finally finds ""Miss Right"" (Katy Selverstone), only to discover she's also just right for the window-dresser job he's trying to fill.3. ""The Joining of Two Unlike Elements Is a Mixture""Drew vows to throw Kate a surprise shotgun wedding after she laments that one of the few states she never entered was that of holy matrimony.4. ""Nature Abhors a Vacuum""When Drew fires his boss's inamorata, Mr. Bell (voice of Kevin Pollak) forces him to employ all his resources to find him a new girlfriend. Unfortunately Kate is the only other woman who rings Bell's chimes.5. ""No Two Things in Nature Are Exactly Alike""Drew's painted into a corner when a female co-worker misconstrues an off-color cartoon he distributed at work and files a lawsuit against him.6. ""Drew Meets Lawyers""With the company attorneys (Penn & Teller) pushing him to settle, and legal aid finding he makes $2000 too much for eligibility, the only other lawyer Drew can afford is Kate's obnoxious ex-boyfriend.7. ""Drew in Court""After weeks of facing sexual-harassment charges brought against him by a co-worker, Drew gets his day in court--acting as his own counsel.8. ""Lewis' Sister""Lewis's newly divorced sister takes an immediate interest in Drew when he takes her on a date - much to Lewis' (and Drew's) chagrin.9. ""Drew and Mrs. Louder""Drew's ""shortcut up the corporate ladder"" new position as the store owner's personal assistant soon turns compromising.10. ""Science Names Suck""Kate feels she's being elbowed out of the group when Drew and the guys welcome back to town an old high school friend.11. ""The Electron Doesn't Fall Far From the Tree""Drew's not too wild about joining his visiting dad's lodge, the Wildebeests, especially after learning that most of the members are bigots.12. ""Isomers Have Distinct Characteristics""Drew is forced to hire scabs when store employees--including Kate--go on strike during the holiday shopping rush.13. ""Drew and the Unstable Element""Drew is threatened by a mentally unstable man (David Cross) who he foolishly hired, then fired for refusing to see the company psychiatrist.14.

It really is funny, but we watch it when the children are asleep.  Lots of adult situations and crude humor.  We have been really excitedly waiting for the other seasons to follow.  We have been waiting a long while.  Check out season 1, if you like adult comedys, you'll really enjoy it.  The only way to see Drew carey now is on the Price is Right!!!!

I've recomended the series to many over the years in repeats.  It's been hard to wait so long.  It's good to see it in print now.  If you hold out until the 3rd season you wil see the best TV show ever from the 90's period, hands down. The first is really only ok, but buy it so they will release all the other seasons.  The first season is ok the 2nd season is near great and the third is pure gold. BUY THIS NOW BEFORE DREW DISAPEARS ALL TOGETHER. This series was a cultural touchpoint for manyfans that spaned the 90's into the 2000's.  Dont let it be forgoten.
