199705,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6300181502,Annie Van Auken,"[0, 0]","SHENANDOAH is a family movie set in battle-torn Virginia in 1864. The story's overall message is trite but true: civilians as well as soldiers die during times of war. A superb ensemble and Technicolor photography are pluses while the picture's limitations are a predictible plot and historical inaccuracy.As to the latter:The 500 acre Anderson farm is located at Shenandoah Gap, an area that Gen. T.J. Jackson and his Union pursuers traversed at least twice (in both directions) and that Gen. Phil Sheridan laid waste so (to paraphrase) ""a crow flying over would have to carry its own provisions."" Yet, the Anderson place remains unscathed, even after an invasion of scavengers, who usually steal whatever can be hauled away and torch anything left behind.Here, Jimmy Stewart is Charlie Anderson-- pater familias to six grown sons, a daughter and daughter-in-law. Charlie is adamantly anti-war, and his boys have avoided the ongoing North/South fray perhaps out of deference. When a quartet of Unioners arrive to confiscate his farm's horses, Charlie is accused of cowardice, so he throws the first punch of a good old donnybrook. Their uninvited guests are sent packing, sans equines.Sixteen-year-old Boy Anderson (Alford) is mistaken for a Reb soldier and captured. Charlie and kin search for him while James (Wayne) with his wife Ann (Ross) and newborn daughter remain behind, only to be ambushed by a band of thugs. Meanwhile, the other Andersons capture and destroy a train hauling Confederate prisoners north, but they're unable to find Boy. On the group's return home, a tragic accident occurs.""Shenandoah"" is available onDVD.Related item:In the sprawling epic, HOW THE WEST WAS WON (1962), Jimmy Stewart plays Linus Rawlings.

199720,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,6300181502,Chrijeff,"[9, 9]","It may be an instance of precognition on the part of its producers, but this film, which was released in the same year in which combat ground troops were sent to Vietnam, not only concerns itself with a similarly divisive war but has a distinctly anti-war tone.  (At a moment when the world seethes with debate over the proper response to Saddam Hussein, it comes again into its own as an echo of current events.)  There's nothing of the ""glory"" of war in it, though it's nowhere near as gritty and graphic as some later war films, and its main focus, like that of any good story (whether written or filmed), is on the people who make the events happen.Though often filed under Westerns, it actually takes place during the Civil War, probably in the late summer and fall of 1864 (Gettysburg and Vicksburg are mentioned as past events).  Stewart plays Charley Anderson, a Virginia farmer, whose 500 acres at Shenandoah Gap are and have always been farmed without the aid of a single slave.  Instead his work force consists of his six sons, Jacob (Glenn Corbett), John (James McMullen), James (Patrick Wayne), Nathan (Charles Robinson), Henry (Tim McIntire), and ""The Boy"" (Philip Alford), aged 16 (Charley's wife Martha ""died the night he was born""), daughter Jenny (Rosemary Forsyth) (who says she can ""outrun, outride, and outshoot"" any of her brothers), and daughter-in-law (James's wife) Ann (Katharine Ross).  Though the war rolls back and forth around him, Charley stoutly maintains that it ""is not mine, and I take no note of it.""  Jacob keeps asking, at each apparent provocation, ""Does it concern us now?"", but even when a Confederate patrol is ambushed and massacred on his land, Charley refuses to get involved.  Not till 51 minutes into the movie, when the Boy is mistaken for a Rebel and picked up as a POW by a small Union patrol, does he say, ""Now it concerns us.""  The remainder of the movie follows the adventures of himself, Jenny, and four of the boys (James and Ann have stayed behind at the farm), shortly joined by Jenny's Confederate-officer husband Sam (Doug McClure), whom they've rescued off a prison train, to find their missing kinsman, with intercut segments showing the Boy's escape from his captors and brief experience of battle.As mentioned, there's very little pageantry or glory in this video, which, given that when it was made going to war as a volunteer was still considered ""the thing to do,"" seems almost incongruous.  And though it's marred by a few minor historical inaccuracies (a black soldier would not be serving in the same unit with white troops in that war, and it seems surprising that the Andersons seem to have not only plenty of food and all their livestock but no refugeed relatives sharing it with them), it manages to give something of the very spirit of noncombatant life at the time.  There's an element of romance in Jenny and Sam's courtship and wedding (she has memorized her half of the vows before she's asked to speak them), which goes unconsummated when a courier brings word to Sam that the Yankees have ""broken through at Winchester.""  There are also moments of humor, like the suspension of a pending battle while the Rebs try to take a ""Union cow"" prisoner (she ultimately dodges back behind the Federal lines and escapes).  Though opposed to the war, Charley is not portrayed as unpatriotic; he asks his old friend Doc Witherspoon, in a concerned tone, ""Virginia's losin', isn't she?""  And the story might almost be called a fable, since it goes so far as to articulate, through Charley, its moral: ""I knew...we weren't likely to find him...But if we don't *try*, we don't *do*.  And if we don't *do*--why are we here on this earth?!""Modern families may find Charley's advice to the hopeful Sam (""Women are like that...[Just] hug her a bit.  'Cause that's all they really want when they're like that, Sam--a little lovin'."") mildly chauvinistic, even though it's closely followed by very similarly toned advice from Ann to Jenny.  Still, it should be kept in mind that in this the script is being true to the era portrayed, and that women in those days were considered more or less second-class citizens.  Younger children may ask an awkward question or two regarding the deaths of James and Ann, murdered by a trio of ""scavengers.""  But on the whole the movie has a very strong pro-family tone, and the older generation, especially those raised on TV Westerns, will also enjoy picking out the familiar faces in the cast: Denver Pyle as Reverend Bjorli, Paul Fix as Witherspoon, Dabbs Greer as neighbor Abernathy, Tom Simcox as Lt. Johnson, George Kennedy as Union Col. Fairchild (a small part but very well done), Edward Faulkner as a Union straggler, Strother Martin as a railroad engineer, James Best as the Boy's fellow escapee Carter, Harry Carey, Jr., as one of their comrades, Kevin Hagen as Mule, Lane Bradford as scallywag Tinkum.  Stewart is, of course, the heart and soul of all that goes on, displaying a range of acting talent that varies from warm fatherly sympathy through cynicism to his famous ""insanity"" phase; indeed, this may be one of the definitive parts of his long career.  The humor, tragedy, and simple family warmth are nicely balanced, and despite its moments of violence and grief, Shenandoah is by no means too intense for the younger kids.  It should also serve as the starting point for some penetrating discussion, especially if the parents watching are old enough to remember the divisions engendered by Vietnam.  This is a highly recommended video on every count.",5,A Civil War movie for its time--and this,1044403200,"02 5, 2003",2003,5567,"['may', 'be', 'instance', 'precognition', 'part', 'producers', 'film',

199722,A3VDGERHHLOQVQ,6300181502,Crabby Apple Mick Lee,"[7, 8]","SHENANDOAH has been a favorite since its 1965 release.  It concerns the tragedy of the Anderson family during the last stages of the American Civil War.  It is a story of how the pride of Charlie Anderson, the patriarch of the family, preserved the family from the strife of the conflict only to have that same pride bring suffering and death to the very footsteps of his household.  After over one hundred forty years  our emotions and perceptions of the Civil War are still complex and conflicted.  Many movie executives worried that showing the war through the eyes of one family would risk the disfavor of entire parts of the country.  Yet despite these concerns SHENANDOAH was well received on both sides of the Mason-Dixon Line.The reason for this is clear upon viewing the movie.  The setting is the Civil War but it is not about the Civil War.  The story is actually an inventive retelling of the prodigal son parable from the New Testament.  James Stewart is the prodigal.  He is a wealthy farmer richly blessed in land and family.  He has six sons, one daughter, one daughter-in-law, and in the course of the story acquires a son-in-law and a granddaughter.  Yet Charlie Anderson's pride is revealed (humorously) as he prays over the family meal at the beginning of the movie.  He gives thanks to God not out of real gratitude but simply because that is what he is supposed to do.  But he cannot let the prayer pass without making the point that it was his family's sweat that put the food on the table-not God's.  Subsequently, Charlie Anderson dutifully takes his family to church; but his behavior and manners betray a subtle disrespect for the institution.  Later events also show us that Charlie Anderson feels no sense of gratitude or obligation to his beloved Virginia nor to the advancing Union forces of the country of his birth.  We come to see a patriarch prideful unto himself unwilling to help and asking none of God and country-so sure of himself that if he stood firm and aloof the war would just pass him and his family by.  Thus the viewer is shown that the destruction and suffering to befall the Andersons is brought about by a lost Confederate cap.It is not that Charlie Anderson is a bad man.  Throughout the movie we see he is a loving father to all his children and quite devoted husband to the memory of his wife.  When he speaks with his soon to be son-in-law about marriage, Charlie Anderson actually has some perceptive things to say.  (Charlie Anderson's little lecture on love may strike some as corny.  But after thirty years of marriage, I can tell you that there's more behind that speech than you'd guess.)  Part of the tragedy is that if Charlie Anderson were consistently a truly bad man perhaps the evil that befalls his family would largely be averted; but it is precisely because he loves his family that the gate is left wide open for the wolves to enter.Lee's army had protected Virginia well for three years; but Union forces had finally broken through and the war was being fought in the fields and towns in the Shenandoah Valley.  Fighting had been getting closer to the Anderson farm until the youngest son is taken prisoner by Union solders after being mistaken for a rebel solder (the lost cap in his procession).  Charlie Anderson undertakes an understandable but truly foolish quest to retrieve his son.  In the midst of two battling armies, the Anderson's go in search of Charlie's son and his captors.  During this quest, the Andersons find a son-in-law; but not the son.  The oldest son is killed as the Andersons are mistaken for enemy riders.  Meanwhile, back at the farm, another son is killed and his wife is gang-raped and murdered while the house is looted by thieves.Charlie Anderson returns from his quest without his youngest son and learns that by leaving to save the one he has exposed his family and farm to the worst.  In trying to keep from losing one, he failed and lost three more.  Charlie Anderson is a defeated and broken man.  At the first meal, Charlie Anderson speaks is usual prayer only to realize what a fool he has been all his life.  He has depended on God's mercy for every crumb.  He was not sufficient unto himself.  As blessed and strong as he was in family and land, all God had to do was remove his protection for a moment for it to all come to ruin.Charlie Anderson's ""return"" in the church and his youngest son's literal return to the family strike many as sentimental; but these are the natural movements of the parable.  SHENANDOAH was made in the 1960's and so does not portray war in much of the grimness we are accustomed to today.  It also only indirectly touches on the subject of slavery and race-two subjects some feel should be front and center in any discussion of the American Civil War.  Again, it can only be pointed out that the story isn't about the war-it is about a particular family.SHENANDOAH has worn well over the years and bears repeated viewings.  It is an excellent movie and one of Jimmy Stewart's most touching characters.",5,THE PRODIGAL  PATRIARCH,1114732800,"04 29, 2005",2005,5045,"['SHENANDOAH', 'been', 'favorite', '1965', 'release', 'tragedy', 'Anderson', 'family', 'last', 'stages', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'story', 'how', 'pride', 'Charlie', 'Anderson', 'patriarch', 'family', 'preserved', 'family', 'strife', 'conflict', 'only', 'have', 'same', 'pride', 'bring', 'suffering', 'death', 'very', 'footsteps', 'household', 'one', 'hundred', 'forty', 'years', 'emotions', 'perceptions', 'Civil', 'War', 'are', 'still', 'complex', 'conflicted', 'Many', 'movie', 'executives', 'worried', 'showing', 'war', 'eyes', 'one', 'family', 'would', 'risk', 'disfavor', 'entire', 'parts', 'country', 'concerns', 'SHENANDOAH', 'was', 'well', 'received', 'sides', 'Mason-Dixon', 'Line.The', 'reason', 'clear', 'viewing', 'movie', 'setting', 'Civil', 'War', 'not', 'Civil', 'War', 'story', 'actually', 'inventive', 'retelling', 'prodigal', 'son', 'parable', 'New', 'Testament', 'James', 'Stewart', 'prodigal', 'wealthy', 'farmer', 'richly', 'blessed', 'land', 'family', 'six', 'sons', 'one', 'daughter', 'one', 'daughter-in-law', 'course', 'story', 'son-in-law', 'granddaughter', 'Charlie', 'Anderson', 'pride', 'revealed', 'humorously', 'family', 'meal', 'beginning', 'movie', 'thanks', 'God', 'not', 'real', 'gratitude', 'simply', 'what', 'supposed', 'do', 'can', 'not', 'let', 'prayer', 'pass', 'making', 'point', 'was', 'family', 'sweat', 'put', 'food', 'table-not', 'God', 'Subsequently', 'Charlie', 'Anderson', 'dutifully', 'family', 'church', 'behavior', 'manners', 'betray', 'subtle', 'disrespect', 'institution', 'Later', 'events', 'also', 'show', 'Charlie', 'Anderson', 'sense', 'gratitude', 'obligation', 'beloved', 'Virginia', 'advancing', 'Union', 'forces', 'country', 'birth', 'come', 'see', 'patriarch', 'prideful', 'unwilling', 'help', 'asking', 'none', 'God', 'country-so', 'sure', 'stood', 'firm', 'aloof', 'war', 'would', 'just', 'pass', 'family', 'Thus', 'viewer', 'shown', 'destruction', 'suffering', 'befall', 'Andersons', 'brought', 'about', 'lost', 'Confederate', 'cap.It', 'not', 'Charlie', 'Anderson', 'bad', 'man', 'movie', 'see', 'loving', 'father', 'children', 'quite', 'devoted', 'husband', 'memory', 'wife', 'When', 'soon', 'be', 'son-in-law', 'marriage', 'Charlie', 'Anderson', 'actually', 'perceptive', 'things', 'say', 'Charlie', 'Anderson', 'little', 'lecture', 'love', 'may', 'strike', 'corny', 'thirty', 'years', 'marriage', 'can', 'tell', 'more', 'speech', ""'d"", 'guess', 'Part', 'tragedy', 'Charlie', 'Anderson', 'were', 'consistently', 'truly', 'bad', 'man', 'perhaps', 'evil', 'family', 'would', 'largely', 'be', 'averted', 'precisely', 'family', 'gate', 'left', 'wide', 'open', 'wolves', 'enter.Lee', 'army', 'had', 'protected', 'Virginia', 'well', 'three', 'years', 'Union', 'forces', 'had', 'finally', 'broken', 'war', 'was', 'being', 'fought', 'fields', 'towns', 'Shenandoah', 'Valley', 'Fighting', 'had', 'been', 'getting', 'closer', 'Anderson', 'farm', 'youngest', 'son', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'Union', 'solders', 'being', 'mistaken', 'rebel', 'solder', 'lost', 'cap', 'procession', 'Charlie', 'Anderson', 'understandable', 'truly', 'foolish', 'quest', 'retrieve', 'son', 'midst', 'two', 'battling', 'armies', 'Anderson', 'go', 'search', 'Charlie', 'son', 'captors', 'quest', 'Andersons', 'find', 'son-in-law', 'not', 'son', 'oldest', 'son', 'killed', 'Andersons', 'are', 'mistaken', 'enemy', 'riders', 'Meanwhile', 'back', 'farm', 'son', 'killed', 'wife', 'gang-raped', 'murdered', 'house', 'looted', 'thieves.Charlie', 'Anderson', 'returns', 'quest', 'youngest', 'son', 'leaving', 'save', 'one', 'exposed', 'family', 'farm', 'worst', 'trying', 'keep', 'losing', 'one', 'failed', 'lost', 'three', 'more', 'Charlie', 'Anderson', 'defeated', 'broken', 'man', 'first', 'meal', 'Charlie', 'Anderson', 'usual', 'prayer', 'only', 'realize', 'what', 'fool', 'been', 'life', 'depended', 'God', 'mercy', 'crumb', 'was', 'not', 'sufficient', 'blessed', 'strong', 'was', 'family', 'land', 'God', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'remove', 'protection', 'moment', 'come', 'ruin.Charlie', 'Anderson', 'return', 'church', 'youngest', 'son', 'literal', 'return', 'family', 'strike', 'many', 'sentimental', 'are', 'natural', 'movements', 'parable', 'SHENANDOAH', 'was', 'made', '1960', 'so', 'not', 'portray', 'war', 'much', 'grimness', 'are', 'accustomed', 'today', 'also', 'only', 'indirectly', 'subject', 'slavery', 'race-two', 'subjects', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'front', 'center', 'discussion', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'Again', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'story', ""n't"", 'war-it', 'particular', 'family.SHENANDOAH', 'worn', 'well', 'years', 'bears', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'excellent', 'movie', 'one', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'most', 'touching', 'characters']",N/A

Actually, it is because it isn't like today's movies that I appreciate it more.  Some find its earnestness too sweet and the humor a bit ham-bone.  But I am willing to transport myself into a time when such things were possible in movies.  All movies have conventions and none are ""realistic"" - not even documentaries.  So, if you can accept one set of conventions, you should be able to adapt to another and appreciate the movie for what it sets out to be.This is not a movie about violence per se.  It is about family and loss, and deals with the notion of trying to be in the world but apart from it and how difficult that can be because the world has a way of rolling over you.  The Civil War is the backdrop of this question.  Jimmy Stewart's character, Charlie Anderson, is a widower who still grieves for his lost sweetheart.  He has a bunch of sons and one daughter.  He tries to keep them out of the war, but cannot.  His daughter is pursued by Lieutenant Sam (Doug McClure) who fights for the Confederacy. (If both armies are bad to Charlie Anderson - the Yankees are the worse army in this movie.)My two favorite scenes are the family prayer over the meal where Charlie thanks God for the meal and food while noting without their hard work it wouldn't be on the table.  The other is when Lieutenant Sam asks Charlie for Jennie's hand in marriage.  Charlie asks Sam why he wants to marry Jennie.  Sam say's its because he loves her.  Charlie says that isn't good enough.  Sam is nonplussed.  Charlie asks if he likes her.  Sam doesn't get it.  And the explanation Charlie gives should be printed on a card and handed to EVERY young couple contemplating marriage.  It is wonderful and true.This is a good movie if not a great one.  If you enjoy Jimmy Stewart, this is a very good performance.

199728,A2OFSDJB3MVQ16,6300181502,Dennis W. Wong,"[1, 1]","This film proven to be perhaps the last big hit for Stewart but what an heartfelt one!! It has endured in various screenings on TV and also resulted in a musical with John McCullum in the role Jimmy created memorably here.  Although he was to make a few more films in this genre (Firecreek, Bandolero,The Rare Breed, Cheyenne Social Club), none of them held a candle to this family oriented Western.  Stewart gives one of his best performances as a patriarch of a large family in the South who tries to hold on to his pacifist ways despite the fact a Civil War is brewing and that his family will be torn apart from it.  This film may not appeal to Stewart fans used to seeing him in the rough edged films he did with Anthony Mann since this film is extremely sentimental and non-edgy but still powerful in its message of tolerance and forgiveness in troubled times.  In a sense, then, this film is timeless regardless of the fact that's it's a Civil War western. Andrew V.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[12, 12]","Charlie Anderson (James Stewart) may be a gritty, crusty, widowed father of six sons and one daughter, but there's no denying this tough patriarch loves and cherishes his family beyond words or understanding.  And with the brutal savagery of the Civil War raging maniacally around his farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, he is able to keep his family out of the conflict--at least, for awhile.  Inexorably, inevitably, the war comes to the front porch of Anderson's home when his youngest son, simply named &quot;Boy&quot; (Phillip Alford) is mistakenly taken prisoner by Union solidiers.And thus the film SHENANDOAH embarks on a more ominous dimension, as Anderson and his sons journey forth into the insanity around them to find the boy.  Their quest is unsuccessful--the subsequent tragedy to the family unbearable.  Stewart so vividly portrays a tough man who is stricken down, again and again, by the horrors of man's inhumanity to man.  Yet he succeeds in keeping his now fragile family together, a family that has abandoned its search and returned home.  Stewart's scene in the family cemetery--a quiet plot now hosting fresh graves--is one of the most moving, compelling scenes I have ever watched.  And if you're not wiping tears from your face when this film reaches its powerful, emotional conclusion, you've either fallen asleep or not paid attention to the story.The supporting cast--including Doug McClure, Glenn Corbett, Rosemary Forsyth, Patrick Wayne, and Katherine Ross--is solid; director Andrew V.

199733,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6300181502,Dr. James Gardner,"[2, 3]","""Shenandoah"" is a 1965 anti-war film concerning the Civil War. It stars James Stewart with an enormous supporting cast that includes Doug McClure, Glenn Cornett, Patrick Wayne, Katherine Ross, and Rosemary Forsyth and a host of characters like Paul Fix (physician), Strother Martin (train engineer), Denver Pyle (preacher), George Kennedy (Union officer), and Harry Carey Jr. (rebel soldier)This was Jimmy Stewart's (1908-97) 68th  film.  He needs little introduction. He ranks #3 on the AFI list of greatest male stars. He was nominated for an Oscar 5 times, winning for ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940), although he's probably better known for ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946). He made nearly 100 films between 1934 and 1991, and was equally at home in westerns (""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"", ""Cheyene Autumn"", Winchester 73""), comedies (""The Shop Around the Corner"", ""Take Her She's Mine""), and drama (""Rear Window"", ""The FBI Story"").This was Katherine Ross' (1940) film debut, having appeared on ""Gunsmoke"" in an episode directed by Andrew McLaglen. She's best known for her Oscar nominated performance in ""The Graduate"" (1967) and her BAFTA winning role in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" (1969).The film is directed by Andrew McLaglen (1920), the son of famous film actor Victor McLaglen who was a staple in films with John Wayne and often directed by John Ford. In fact he got his start in ""The Quiet Man"" (1952) starring his dad, Maureen O'Hara, and John Wayne and directed by John Ford. McLaglen specialized in westerns and war films, and also spent a lot of time directing TV series like ""Gunsmoke"" and ""Have Gun Will Travel"".Photography is by William Clothier (1903-96) who is best known for his frequent work with John Wayne. Clothier and Wayne worked together on 21 films, and with John Ford they worked on 4 films -  ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""The Horse Soldiers"" (1959), ""Liberty Valance"" (1962), and ""Donovan's Reef"" (1963).  Clothier was nominated for two Oscars - ""The Alamo"" (1960) and ""Cheyenne Autumn"" (1964). Clothier's motto was ""anything for a shot"". He often worked with McLaglen.The music is from Frank Skinner (1897-1968), and this was one of the last of Skinner's more than 200 film compositions. He was nominated 5 times for an Oscar, for films like ""The Houise of Seven Gables"" (1940) and ""Arabian Nights"" (1942).Coming as it does in 1965, the anti-war sentiments of the film are loud and clear. ""Shenandoah"" was #9 in the box office for 1965 - the top grossing films were ""The Sound of Music"", ""Doctor Zhivago"", ""Thunderball"", ""A Thousand Clowns"", and ""The Great Race"". The Oscar  winners were ""Sound of Music"" (Picture, Director),  ""Cat Ballou"" (Actor), and ""Darling"" (Actress). Other westerns released that year include ""For a Few Dollars More"", ""Major Dundee"", ""The Rounders"",  and ""The Sons of Katie Elder"".You need to be a big fan of Jimmy Stewart to enjoy this film since he is in virtually every scene. As such, the film moves at a slow pace, to capture Stewart's particular brand of acting. The NY Times called it ""a pretty good Civil War drama - an altogether respectable one"" but noted that it ""is also too long...and...hits and hangs onto many a static snag."" The Cleveland Press praises Stewart as ""an iconoclast"" but said ""The film is good but misses greatness.""One of the main problems with this film is that it fails to use the enormous talent who are there for a few brief seconds, say a few meager lines, and then disappear.Fans of Jimmy Stewart will enjoy this film, but for others, there are far better westerns, and even narrowing the field to Civil War dramas, there are so many better films (e.g., ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""The Horse Soldiers"", ""Dances with Wolves"", ""GWTW"", ""They Died with Their Boots On"").",3,Anti-war western,1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,3766,"['Shenandoah', '1965', 'anti-war', 'film', 'concerning', 'Civil', 'War', 'James', 'Stewart', 'enormous', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Doug', 'McClure', 'Glenn', 'Cornett', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'Rosemary', 'Forsyth', 'host', 'characters', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'physician', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'train', 'engineer', 'Denver', 'Pyle', 'preacher', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'Union', 'officer', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'rebel', 'soldier', 'was', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', '1908-97', '68th', 'film', 'little', 'introduction', '3', 'AFI', 'list', 'greatest', 'male', 'stars', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', '5', 'times', 'winning', 'Philadelphia', 'Story', '1940', 'probably', 'better', 'known', 'Wonderful', 'Life', '1946', 'made', 'nearly', '100', 'films', '1934', '1991', 'was', 'equally', 'home', 'westerns', 'Man', 'Who', 'Shot', 'Liberty', 'Valance', 'Cheyene', 'Autumn', 'Winchester', '73', 'comedies', 'Shop', 'Corner', 'Take', 'Mine', 'drama', 'Rear', 'Window', 'FBI', 'Story', '.This', 'was', 'Katherine', 'Ross', '1940', 'film', 'debut', 'having', 'appeared', 'Gunsmoke', 'episode', 'directed', 'Andrew', 'McLaglen', 'best', 'known', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'Graduate', '1967', 'BAFTA', 'winning', 'role', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', '1969', '.The', 'film', 'directed', 'Andrew', 'McLaglen', '1920', 'son', 'famous', 'film', 'actor', 'Victor', 'McLaglen', 'who', 'was', 'staple', 'films', 'John', 'Wayne', 'often', 'directed', 'John', 'Ford', 'fact', 'got', 'start', 'Quiet', 'Man', '1952', 'starring', 'dad', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'John', 'Wayne', 'directed', 'John', 'Ford', 'McLaglen', 'specialized', 'westerns', 'war', 'films', 'also', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'directing', 'TV', 'series', 'Gunsmoke', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', '.Photography', 'William', 'Clothier', '1903-96', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'frequent', 'work', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Clothier', 'Wayne', 'worked', 'together', '21', 'films', 'John', 'Ford', 'worked', '4', 'films', 'Fort', 'Apache', '1948', 'Horse', 'Soldiers', '1959', 'Liberty', 'Valance', '1962', 'Donovan', 'Reef', '1963', 'Clothier', 'was', 'nominated', 'two', 'Oscars', 'Alamo', '1960', 'Cheyenne', 'Autumn', '1964', 'Clothier', 'motto', 'was', 'anything', 'shot', 'often', 'worked', 'McLaglen.The', 'music', 'Frank', 'Skinner', '1897-1968', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'Skinner', 'more', '200', 'film', 'compositions', 'was', 'nominated', '5', 'times', 'Oscar', 'films', 'Houise', 'Seven', 'Gables', '1940', 'Arabian', 'Nights', '1942', '.Coming', '1965', 'anti-war', 'sentiments', 'film', 'are', 'loud', 'clear', 'Shenandoah', 'was', '9', 'box', 'office', '1965', 'top', 'grossing', 'films', 'were', 'Sound', 'Music', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'Thunderball', 'Thousand', 'Clowns', 'Great', 'Race', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'were', 'Sound', 'Music', 'Picture', 'Director', 'Cat', 'Ballou', 'Actor', 'Darling', 'Actress', 'Other', 'westerns', 'released', 'year', 'include', 'Few', 'Dollars', 'More', 'Major', 'Dundee', 'Rounders', 'Sons', 'Katie', 'Elder', '.You', 'need', 'be', 'big', 'fan', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'enjoy', 'film', 'virtually', 'scene', 'such', 'film', 'moves', 'slow', 'pace', 'capture', 'Stewart', 'particular', 'brand', 'acting', 'NY', 'Times', 'called', 'pretty', 'good', 'Civil', 'War', 'drama', 'altogether', 'respectable', 'one', 'noted', 'also', 'too', 'long', 'hits', 'hangs', 'many', 'static', 'snag', 'Cleveland', 'Press', 'Stewart', 'iconoclast', 'said', 'film', 'good', 'greatness', 'One', 'main', 'problems', 'film', 'use', 'enormous', 'talent', 'who', 'are', 'there', 'few', 'brief', 'seconds', 'say', 'few', 'meager', 'lines', 'then', 'disappear.Fans', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'others', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'westerns', 'even', 'narrowing', 'field', 'Civil', 'War', 'dramas', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'better', 'films', 'e.g.', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'Horse', 'Soldiers', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'GWTW', 'Died', 'Their', 'Boots']",N/A

Naturally something really horrible happens because of the hat.  Another thing that irked me and it's irked me with a number of films from this period is the blind happiness in going to church.

Usually we attended blockbuster musicals and comedies.When I say this is a star vehicle for Stewart, I mean that he gets more lines than anyone else, and he gets all the good lines. There are a fair number of good lines in this movie, which tells the story of a Virginia farmer who tries to keep himself and his sons out of the Civil War raging all around him. He is successful at tending his own business exclusively (he doesn't believe in slavery and finds no reason he or any of his should fight for it) until the war finds him. The South tries to requisition (""steal"") his animals, which leads to an altercation. His youngest boy is carried off by mistake by the North as a prisoner of war. Dad sets off to find his son. The family does not remain unscathed, due to bad men and bad luck.Shenandoah is probably one of the last Hollywood films that is unabashedly religious in underlying orientation, in the old style of the 1940s and 50's. Though Stewart's character has, shall we say, a strained relationship with God, he keeps his family tied to the church -- to fulfill his wife's final wishes. There's a very effective scene at the end where he talks to his wife Martha at her grave, longing for her to be there to give him some comforting words to help him deal with the tragedy he has just endured.It's a simple story, effectively told. You could say it was an anti-war movie, but without the trappings of modern anti-war films, which tend to end up being anti-American. This film is more anti-government, in my opinion.

Dibert ""the wessel DVD Collector and ...","[0, 0]","Shenandoah was released in movie theaters on June 3, 1965; it was a western that contained Drama and war. Shenandoah was a 1965 American Civil War film starring James Stewart, Doug McClure, Glenn Corbett, and Patrick Wayne. Andrew V. Mclaglen directed this film. Though set during the American Civil War, the film's strong antiwar and humanitarian themes resonated with audiences in later years as attitudes began to change toward the Vietnam War. Upon its release, the film was praised for its message, as well as its technical production. In 1966, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound. For her part in Shenandoah, Rosemary Forsyth was nominated for a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer - Female.Summary: Set in the state of Virginia during the American Civil War, James Stewart plays the role of family patriarch, Charlie Anderson. He and his six sons run the family farm, while his daughter, Jenny (Rosemary Forsyth), and daughter-in-law, Ann (Katherine Ross) take care of the housework. Charlie's oldest son, Jacob (Glenn Corbett) wants to join the war, but Charlie repeatedly tells his family that they won't join the war until it concerns them. Although a few of the boys want to join, they respect their father's wishes, and remain on the farm. Charlie's daughter, Jenny, is courting a young soldier, Sam (Doug McClure). He wants to marry Jenny, and when Charlie gives his permission, the wedding occurs a few days later. As soon as the vows are said, a young lieutenant rides up and announces that Sam is wanted beck immediately. Sam leaves, much to the sorrow of his new bride. While out hunting raccoon, Charlie's youngest son and his friend stumble onto a confederate ambush. They run away, and stop for a drink at a pond. The boy is wearing an old rebel soldier cap that he found at the river. When a union patrol comes on them, the boy is takes as a prisoner of war. His young friend, Gabriel (Eugene Jackson), runs to tell the Andersons what happened. When Charlie hears the news, he and his sons, and his daughter Jenny leave to look for the boy, leaving James (Patrick Wayne) and his wife, Ann at the farm with their young baby. Meanwhile, the boy is taken to a prisoner of war camp. He finds a man (James Best) who is going to escape, and decides to let the boy come along. They and a few other men successfully make it out of the camp, and start heading south. Not long after, they come onto a confederate camp, and are soon involved in a skirmish. The boy's friend is killed, and the boy himself is shot in the leg. When a union soldier comes along about to kill him, the boy looks up into the face of his friend, Gabriel. Gabriel helps him off into a bush to hide until after the battle.Questions: Who is looking for a boy? Who is this boy? Why did the boy leave on his horse? Who overjoyed when she sees what? Whom does Sam leave with? What does Sam tell the boys to do? What happens on the farm? Who takes shots at Jacob? What happen to James and Ann? Who starts there day with a prayer? Who hears church bells ringing in the distance? Who is the Pastor?My Thoughts: I don't like war pictures but this one was different. Usually in war pictures, the audience goes to war right from the beginning. However, in this picture the war comes to the Andersons. The Andersons did everything to stay away from the war but the war came to them. I thought Jimmy Stewart was excellent in his role as Mr. Anderson. I love the filming of the farm and how the Andersons work the farm. I thought Rosemary Forsyth was also excellent in her role as Jennie Mr. Anderson daughter. I also thought that Katherine Ross was great playing the role of Mr. Anderson daughter in law. I usually don't like war pictures but I make an exception in this case. Because of the great acting and the beautiful scenery of the Anderson farm, I give this movie 8 weasel stars.

However, the war catches up to them eventually and with it comes tragedy,loss,death and finally, hope.Director Mclagen was mainly known for directing films more of the Action variety, but embues the film with a great subtlety and warmth that connects and involves the viewer in the story.Stewart's character is a noble character whom the audience can identify with. A good man who is a widower and truly loves and cares for his family and does not believe(rightfully) in the insanity of War. The rest of the cast are absolutely believable in there parts, but it's Stewart that anchors this film.The film is often classified in the Western genre, but it's really more of a historical Drama and one of cinema's best interpretations of the American Civil War.Both sides are handled with equally amounts of symapthy and neither are villiainized for the antagonist of this piece is rather war itself than the men involved therein.Veteran actor George Kennedy has a classic bit as a world weary general who sympathesizes with Stewart's dstraught father who has just had his young son taken prisoner by the Union Army. It's a little scene but it adds alot of weight to the film.Credit must be given to how unexpected the deaths are presented within this film, adding extra layers of tragedy that makes for a film destined to be labelled a tearjerker.Easily one of the best films about this most written about topic in American history and one of the most neglected.

It is not long, however, before the film's tone changes when the youngest son (Boy) is taken prisoner simply because of an event that takes place near the beginning of the film (I won't spoil it for anyone who has yet to see the film). From that moment on the film becomes much darker in tone and events take their toll upon the family.It is an enjoyable film, Jimmy Stewart (as ever) turns in a fine performance.The picture quality is excellent with only one small scene looking slightly below par (I would rate it 95% in comparison with the rest of the film).

It's full of sweeping expanse, wagons-west adventure and stark, beautiful cinematography that makes one wish for a western landscape that, in reality, never truly existed.Universal Studios has developed a rather nasty track record with their catalogue titles ever since the introduction of DVD.

199766,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6300181502,Only-A-Child,"[1, 1]","It is intriguing how some comments confidently classify ""Shenandoah"" (1965) as an anti-war film and others see it as pro-war propaganda (insert Vietnam here). The anti-war advocates must be basing their position on the film's similarity to ""Friendly Persuasion"" while the propaganda pundits appear to have been influenced by the fact that screenwriter James Lee Barrett would write the script for ""The Green Berets"" a couple years later. But given that the screenplay was written in 1963 and actual production was completed by late 1964, it is unlikely that Vietnam (pro or con) was much of a factor. National consciousness was a couple years away from regarding that little adventure as something of real significance.I think the real strength of ""Shenandoah"" is that it maintains the same kind of uneasy neutrality that the Anderson family holds to throughout the film. It shows good and bad people on both sides as the family attempts to just distance themselves as much as possible from the conflict. That they are not entirely successful in doing so hardly sends a clear message of either pacifism of patriotism.Director Andrew V. McLaglen's films are some of the least political you are likely to find, the exception being his frequent focus on strong women. In ""Shenandoah"", neither Charlie Anderson (James Stewart) nor his six sons are a match for daughter Jennie (Rosemary Forsyth). The father-daughter dynamic purposely gets a disproportionate amount of screen time as Jennie is shown to be the child most like the father and the only one who routinely stands up to him. This merits the most attention if one is looking for subtle political messages in the film.Stewart is the only cast member with more screen time than Forsyth. Her romantic scenes with Doug McClure are also first rate, with a touch of comic relief as you begin to realize that he has little idea what he is getting himself into. And their reunion scene at the prisoner of war train is handled extremely well.Civil war buffs will generally enjoy this film as it presents the war from the (until then unprecedented) point of view of a southern family who did not buy into the frenzy for secession in 1861 and remains resolute even as their property is overrun with union troops. It wouldn't be until ""Cold Mountain"" that another film would present the reality of a not so united southern home front. Eastern Tennessee and western Virginia remained pro-union, and Winston County, Alabama seceded from the state and attempted to stay in the union.Of course the buffs will find many inaccurate historical details.

It is old-fashioned in the sense that it deals with love of family and friends in a tender way... For this, and many other reasons, it stays in the heart and mind...Stewart has never been in better form than in ""Shenandoah."" He is an archetypal widower, deeply concerned for his six sons and one daughter on their farm in a remote section of Virginia, while the Civil War rages around them... A pacifist and a man who refuses slavery, Stewart holds himself and his sons away from both the Confederate and Union causes... But, for all his hatred of war, the rush of events finally draws him into that tumultuous and heartbreaking clash...When he loses his 16-year-o1d youngest boy to the Union soldiers as a prisoner, he is compelled into action... He presides with cold affection over his daughter's marriage to a young Confederate officer... He visits his wife's grave (she had died giving birth to the son who is now a prisoner) and in simple and sincere words movingly talks with her... Stewart's hatred of war is continually intact, but his faith in family remains stronger than ever...The film is alive with great performances... Katharine Ross, in her first film role, is moving as the daughter-in-law... Rosemary Forsyth is strong and stately as Stewart's only daughter, who dresses in male clothes and joins her brothers in their search for their captured sibling... George Kennedy is effective as a Union officer who helps Stewart with a pass to obtain his son... Paul Fix is affecting as the attentive and concerned family doctor, and many others round out a superb cast...""Shenandoah"" was Stewart's first film with director Andrew V. McLaglen, the 45-year-o1d son of the famous Victor, who had won a Best Actor Oscar in John Ford's ""The Informer"" in 1935... McLaglen had been an assistant director to John Ford, Budd Boetticher, and others, and had absorbed much from them, before emerging with his own individual directing style...Nominated for a Best Sound Oscar, ""Shenandoah"" exudes a quality that seems to have partially disappeared from American life...

199779,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,6300181502,Stanley Crowe,"[0, 0]","Things are going badly for the Confederate forces after Gettysburg, and they need men, and they need horses. Early in the movie, some horse dealers come to a farm and offer to buy the farmer's horses, and they threaten to just take them if he won't sell.  The farmer has five strapping sons, and a good old fist fight breaks out, as the farmer and his boys defend their property -- it's choreographed for considerable comic effect (the youngest boy keeps getting knocked into the horse trough) and is reminiscent of the end of the barn-raising scene in ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.""  By the end of the movie, the farmer is standing by his wife's grave, telling her that she has company now -- three members of the family have joined her in the family plot.So this movie has all kinds of tonal problems, and the best one can say is that James Stewart, as Virginia farmer Charlie Anderson, is reasonably believable at any given moment, whether he's in his quasi-comic foxy patriarch mode, in his obsessed searcher mode, or in his grieving father/widower mode.  But all that doesn't add up to a character.  The action takes place late in the Civil War (after Gettysburg).  The wholesome family scenes, with their strong comic undertones just don't jive with the consequences of Anderson's decision to go after his youngest son (at whose birth Anderson's wife died) when he has been mistakenly taken prisoner by the Union Army -- he has been wearing a Confederate cap, and the Union captors reasonably assume that he's a Confederate boy soldier.  Anderson abhors slavery, but he also abhors war, and in a Confederate state, Virginia, he tries to remain isolated from it and get on with his farming.  Even his daughter's marriage to a young Confederate officer resolves itself in his mind to the question of whether the young man likes the girl.  He never raises with either the question of the rights and wrongs of the war, or of the implications of the fact that the South is clearly losing, or the issue of his son-in-law's feelings about slavery.  Are we to see Anderson as a naif, a kind of late-in-life Candide, who thinks that if he doesn't think about history, history won't bother with him?  Or is he the obsessed searcher seeking to keep his family together -- and in trying to do so, at least contributing to the violent deaths of three of them?  We see Anderson conversing in spirit with his late wife at her graveside, and Stewart does it well, but the questions of his judgment and possible culpability don't seem to enter his mind.There are some striking scenes -- the strongest might be the one where Anderson and his sons stop a train that is carrying Confederate prisoners so that they can find out if his son is among them.  He isn't, but by chance his son-in-law is!  The burning of the empty train is well filmed.  On the other hand, the following scene in which Anderson prepares a marriage bed in a deserted house so that his daughter's marriage can be consummated (while the rest of the family wait downstairs) is a bit cringe-inducing (the son-in-law had been summoned to report for duty right at the end of the wedding ceremony).The actors do their jobs, but the writing isn't strong enough to give the sons distinct characters. Rosemary Forsyth is attractively feisty as Anderson's daughter, and Katherine Ross hasn't much to do as his daughter-in-law except have a baby.  George Kennedy is a dignified Union General, to balance the son-in-law's decent Confederate officer.  The movie resolutely doesn't take sides -- so that the general ""war is hell"" message can get across in an uncomplicated kind of way.  But things aren't really that simple, and the movie avoids too much and sacrifices emotional coherence and credible characterization to boot.",2,what does it want to be?,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,3777,"['Things', 'are', 'going', 'badly', 'Confederate', 'forces', 'Gettysburg', 'need', 'men', 'need', 'horses', 'Early', 'movie', 'horse', 'dealers', 'come', 'farm', 'offer', 'buy', 'farmer', 'horses', 'threaten', 'just', 'take', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sell', 'farmer', 'five', 'strapping', 'sons', 'good', 'old', 'fist', 'fight', 'breaks', 'out', 'farmer', 'boys', 'defend', 'property', 'choreographed', 'considerable', 'comic', 'effect', 'youngest', 'boy', 'getting', 'knocked', 'horse', 'trough', 'reminiscent', 'end', 'barn-raising', 'scene', 'Seven', 'Brides', 'Seven', 'Brothers', 'end', 'movie', 'farmer', 'standing', 'wife', 'grave', 'telling', 'company', 'now', 'three', 'members', 'family', 'have', 'joined', 'family', 'plot.So', 'movie', 'kinds', 'tonal', 'problems', 'best', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Virginia', 'farmer', 'Charlie', 'Anderson', 'reasonably', 'believable', 'given', 'moment', 'quasi-comic', 'foxy', 'patriarch', 'mode', 'obsessed', 'searcher', 'mode', 'grieving', 'father/widower', 'mode', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'character', 'action', 'place', 'late', 'Civil', 'War', 'Gettysburg', 'wholesome', 'family', 'scenes', 'strong', 'comic', 'undertones', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'jive', 'consequences', 'Anderson', 'decision', 'go', 'youngest', 'son', 'birth', 'Anderson', 'wife', 'died', 'when', 'been', 'mistakenly', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'Union', 'Army', 'been', 'wearing', 'Confederate', 'cap', 'Union', 'captors', 'reasonably', 'assume', 'Confederate', 'boy', 'soldier', 'Anderson', 'abhors', 'slavery', 'also', 'war', 'Confederate', 'state', 'Virginia', 'remain', 'isolated', 'get', 'farming', 'Even', 'daughter', 'marriage', 'young', 'Confederate', 'officer', 'mind', 'question', 'young', 'man', 'girl', 'never', 'question', 'rights', 'wrongs', 'war', 'implications', 'fact', 'South', 'clearly', 'losing', 'issue', 'son-in-law', 'feelings', 'slavery', 'Are', 'see', 'Anderson', 'naif', 'kind', 'late-in-life', 'Candide', 'who', ""n't"", 'think', 'history', 'history', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'obsessed', 'searcher', 'seeking', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'trying', 'do', 'so', 'least', 'contributing', 'violent', 'deaths', 'three', 'see', 'Anderson', 'conversing', 'spirit', 'late', 'wife', 'graveside', 'Stewart', 'well', 'questions', 'judgment', 'possible', 'culpability', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'enter', 'mind.There', 'are', 'striking', 'scenes', 'strongest', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'where', 'Anderson', 'sons', 'stop', 'train', 'carrying', 'Confederate', 'prisoners', 'so', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'son', ""n't"", 'chance', 'son-in-law', 'burning', 'empty', 'train', 'well', 'filmed', 'other', 'hand', 'following', 'scene', 'Anderson', 'marriage', 'bed', 'deserted', 'house', 'daughter', 'marriage', 'can', 'be', 'consummated', 'rest', 'family', 'wait', 'downstairs', 'bit', 'cringe-inducing', 'son-in-law', 'had', 'been', 'summoned', 'report', 'duty', 'right', 'end', 'wedding', 'ceremony', '.The', 'actors', 'do', 'jobs', 'writing', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'give', 'sons', 'distinct', 'characters', 'Rosemary', 'Forsyth', 'attractively', 'feisty', 'Anderson', 'daughter', 'Katherine', 'Ross', ""n't"", 'much', 'do', 'daughter-in-law', 'have', 'baby', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'dignified', 'Union', 'General', 'balance', 'son-in-law', 'decent', 'Confederate', 'officer', 'movie', 'resolutely', ""n't"", 'take', 'sides', 'so', 'general', 'war', 'hell', 'message', 'can', 'get', 'uncomplicated', 'kind', 'way', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'that', 'simple', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'emotional', 'coherence', 'credible', 'characterization', 'boot']",N/A
199780,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,6300181502,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[4, 8]","Replace the allegedly anti-Semitic, alcoholic ax wielder from ""The Patriot"" with taciturn Jimmy Stewart, and you've basically got ""Shenandoah,"" a well-meaning film whose strength lies in its performances and sentimentality and certainly not in its plotting.Cribbed a bit from the better ""Friendly Persuasion,"" the plot concerns an irascible Southern farmer (Stewart) who stubbornly -- and correctly -- refuses to let his sons join the lost cause that is the American Civil War.  His stand is less a moral than a selfish one, and there are several effective moments where is proven right, not the least of which is the slaughter of the command of a young officer who just minutes earlier challenges Stewart's stand.  Stewart's point that Virginia didn't lift one finger to help raise his children is an economical and rational defense to the argument that their lives are nonetheless owed to the state.There are other scenes that rather maddeningly come close to making this a better film than it is:  an otherwise capable officer's (Doug McClure, who could be played by a prettied-up Matt Damon in a bio-pic) nervous asking for Stewart's daughter's hand in marriage, Stewart's demands of a sympathetic union colonel (a self-effacing George Kennedy), his fury at the young sentinel who shoots one of his sons, a brief but bloody battle, and the quiet horror when murderous scavengers inevitably invade his all-but-deserted home.Unfortunately, they're blunted by some rather dopey elements, including Stewart allowing his youngest son (rather annoyingly referred to as ""the boy"") to trundle about the countryside wearing a discarded confederate cap along with his gray clothes (you can see where that's going), his leaving his home virtually defenseless when horrific battles are occuring just miles away, and the baffling conclusion son Glenn Corbett comes to upon seeing the decimated troop his father kept him from joining.In fact, I found myself at the end less moved by the power of the story and more irritated as to how Stewart's character, despite his ego, determination, and self-righteousness could not see that had he simply told the kid to take that hat off, none of the tragedy in the story would have happened.  I generally prefer older movies because they're so much smarter and more natural than newer ones -- but not this time.Stewart and the rest of the cast are quite good, though Patrick Wayne is so toothy in his role that you might be torn between sorrow and relief by the ultimate fate of his character.  And, despite its thematic heaviness, the film often has much lighter moments more appropriate for a Disney film, which ironically may be what finally holds everything together.  Watch for a young Katherine Ross in a supporting role, and try to ignore some of the historical liberties.

199781,AK61LQI92GTCH,6300181502,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[18, 32]","Jimmy Stewart plays the cigar chomping patriarch of a Virginia family during the waning days of the Civil War in SHENANDOAH, an old-fashioned epic western.  For half of the movie it ain't ""his"" war, and the movie lumbers ahead lethargically until something happens to throw him, and his brood, into it.I remember seeing and enjoying SHENANDOAH a generation or so ago.  I watched it again recently and was a little surprised how annoyed I was with it.  One of us has changed.To begin with, the small historical inaccuracies, although nothing in themselves, accumulated to critical mass and forced me to pay attention to them.  Charles Anderson's (Stewart) brood would NEVER have been allowed to respectfully decline to join the Confederate army.  The South was drafting men from 15-55 by the time this movie took place.  A musketeer fires a minie ball into a covered cart and the cart explodes in a fireball.  Minie balls were small lumps of lead, hot but not explosive or hot enough to cause an explosion.  An integrated Union unit comes across a young pair of boys so the African-American soldier can tell the black youth that ""he's a slave no longer.""  No Union units were integrated, save that most were commanded by white officers.  At one point daughter Jennie (Rosemary Forsyth) tells Pa Anderson that ""That's the last of coffee.""  Unless they were independently wealthy, or had been growing their own coffee, the Anderson's last cup of coffee was about three years earlier.  Towards the end of the war, coffee was worth its weight in gold in the south....Okay, I'm nitpicking and I'll stop, although I've still got more in my cartridge box and could carp about everything from costumes to a ludicrously improbable train hijacking.  I wouldn't have been so critical if the movie had caught a spark sometime before the half-way point, but it wasted so much time establishing things.  And I do mean wasted - a wedding that should have taken about a minute of screen time is blown up to about 8 minutes worth, with the married couple, for no discernable reason, reciting their vows en tote.  Both of them.Still, the movie picks up a bit when events conspire to make it Pa Anderson's war, as well.  Stewart is a great actor, maybe the greatest screen actor ever, and it's fortunate for this movie that he's in it.  Who else could read a line like this convincingly? ""We have to try.  If you don't try, you can't do.  And if we don't do, why are we here on this earth?""  Why, indeed?Okay.  Leaden pacing,  historical inaccuracies up the wazoo, goofy script.  Have I missed anything?Yep.  The director sheds some unnecessary blood at the end and shamefully manipulates the audience in the final scene.  Two stars.  One for the photography, one for Stewart.",2,Away you rolling river,1096675200,"10 2, 2004",2004,2756,"['Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'cigar', 'chomping', 'patriarch', 'Virginia', 'family', 'waning', 'days', 'Civil', 'War', 'SHENANDOAH', 'old-fashioned', 'epic', 'western', 'half', 'movie', 'ai', ""n't"", 'war', 'movie', 'lumbers', 'ahead', 'lethargically', 'something', 'happens', 'throw', 'brood', 'it.I', 'remember', 'seeing', 'enjoying', 'SHENANDOAH', 'generation', 'so', 'ago', 'watched', 'again', 'recently', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'how', 'annoyed', 'was', 'One', 'changed.To', 'begin', 'small', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'nothing', 'accumulated', 'critical', 'mass', 'forced', 'pay', 'attention', 'Charles', 'Anderson', 'Stewart', 'brood', 'would', 'NEVER', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'respectfully', 'decline', 'join', 'Confederate', 'army', 'South', 'was', 'drafting', 'men', '15-55', 'time', 'movie', 'took', 'place', 'musketeer', 'minie', 'ball', 'covered', 'cart', 'cart', 'fireball', 'Minie', 'balls', 'were', 'small', 'lumps', 'lead', 'hot', 'not', 'explosive', 'hot', 'enough', 'cause', 'explosion', 'integrated', 'Union', 'unit', 'young', 'pair', 'boys', 'African-American', 'soldier', 'can', 'tell', 'black', 'youth', 'slave', 'longer', 'Union', 'units', 'were', 'integrated', 'save', 'most', 'were', 'commanded', 'white', 'officers', 'one', 'point', 'daughter', 'Jennie', 'Rosemary', 'Forsyth', 'Pa', 'Anderson', 'last', 'coffee', 'were', 'independently', 'wealthy', 'had', 'been', 'growing', 'own', 'coffee', 'Anderson', 'last', 'cup', 'coffee', 'was', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'end', 'war', 'coffee', 'was', 'worth', 'weight', 'gold', 'south', '.Okay', ""'m"", 'nitpicking', ""'ll"", 'stop', ""'ve"", 'still', 'got', 'more', 'cartridge', 'box', 'could', 'carp', 'everything', 'costumes', 'ludicrously', 'improbable', 'train', 'hijacking', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'so', 'critical', 'movie', 'had', 'caught', 'spark', 'sometime', 'half-way', 'point', 'wasted', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'establishing', 'things', 'do', 'mean', 'wasted', 'wedding', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'about', 'minute', 'screen', 'time', 'blown', 'up', '8', 'minutes', 'worth', 'married', 'couple', 'discernable', 'reason', 'reciting', 'vows', 'tote', 'them.Still', 'movie', 'up', 'bit', 'when', 'events', 'conspire', 'make', 'Pa', 'Anderson', 'war', 'as', 'well', 'Stewart', 'great', 'actor', 'maybe', 'greatest', 'screen', 'actor', 'ever', 'fortunate', 'movie', 'Who', 'else', 'could', 'read', 'line', 'convincingly', 'have', 'try', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'why', 'are', 'here', 'earth', 'Why', 'indeed', 'Okay', 'Leaden', 'pacing', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'wazoo', 'goofy', 'script', 'Have', 'missed', 'anything', 'Yep', 'director', 'unnecessary', 'blood', 'end', 'shamefully', 'audience', 'final', 'scene', 'Two', 'stars', 'One', 'photography', 'one', 'Stewart']",N/A

As many reviewers have already noted, this is not Mr. Stewart's best but the questions it raises about the relative morality of war and our obligation to the state are interesting ones indeed.

Probably this film. released in 1965, sought to capitalize on growing ambivalence or concern about America's involvement in South Vietnam.What really rankled me about this film is that in order to supply raison d'etre characters had to do really stupid things - Charlie Anderson's (James Stewart's) 16  years old noncombatant son wears a confederate cap while out coon hunting among patrolling Union cavalry and is thus taken prisoner of war; Anderson's other son, responsible for the safety of his wife and baby girl, while unarmed, turns his back - with catastrophic consequences - on an armed stranger who drifts onto the family farm.
