It may have been exciting in 1972 when it was released, 42 years ago, when viewers would have enjoyed the plot and scenery, but it is now 42 years alter we have seen essentially the same plot with little variation frequently. Yet the film does display the characters of some half a dozen of the people in the film very nicely, although not the character of any Indians in it, for the Indians are treated as they were in most films of the era, badly. Nevertheless, after a difficult day of work, the film can be a restful diversion.",3,Good characterization but a plot we saw many times,1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,555,"['grade', 'B', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'exciting', '1972', 'when', 'was', 'released', '42', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'viewers', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'plot', 'scenery', 'now', '42', 'years', 'alter', 'have', 'seen', 'essentially', 'same', 'plot', 'little', 'variation', 'frequently', 'film', 'display', 'characters', 'half', 'dozen', 'people', 'film', 'very', 'nicely', 'not', 'character', 'Indians', 'Indians', 'are', 'treated', 'were', 'most', 'films', 'era', 'badly', 'Nevertheless', 'difficult', 'day', 'work', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'restful', 'diversion']",N/A

George Peppard and Pernell Robertsd are in it but the movie is boring and predictable.  The sets do not seem real and the Indians look fake.  Western movie lovers will see the flaws right away and will turn the movie off.  No wonder this film was so cheap--you get what you pay for.
