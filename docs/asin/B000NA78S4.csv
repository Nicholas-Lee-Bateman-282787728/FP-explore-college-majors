1055781,A59NEDTG1DHG7,B000NA78S4,Addicted2Amazon!,"[80, 82]","I bought ""ENVYGirls"" hesitantly.  I had previously been dupped into purchasing Carmen Electra's ""Aerobic Striptease"" DVD (from the same producers) expecting a fun but somewhat effective workout, and have never forgiven myself since! Nonetheless, the reviews that I read on Amazon convinced me to take a chance on this one.  And I am happy to say that I made the right decision!This DVD is without doubt one of my favorite toning workouts.  Period.First off, as evidenced by the packaging, the production is first-rate.  It is as clear and well-edited as any major Hollywood production, and the absolutely gorgeous island setting (South Pacific?? Carribean??) inspires me to work out even harder.  You can practically feel the breeze coming off the ocean! :-) The music is GREAT, hip and modern; I love it! It's so refreshing to actually work out to a good soundtrack instead of the generic dance club beat that is so prevalent in exercise videos.The entire concept of ""ENVYGirls"" is that of a ""superteam of fitness"" (their words, not mine), each one with a particularly good body part.  Each girl then leads you through a 15-20 minute workout to help you get that particularly good body part. The parts are: Abs, Buns, Legs and Arms. There is an optional 4-min. warmup (it is the same on all four programs) and 5-min. express workouts for each program.Make no mistake, this is not just an eye candy DVD a la Carmen Electra.  It actually is a pretty effective strength workout.  The moves are designed by celebrity trainer Michael Carson who is very knowledgable and inspiring but not drill sergeant-like (if you've ever seen ""The Biggest Loser,"" think Bob, not Jillian!).  Michael does a voiceover commentary on the warmup (as I preceeded this workout with cardio, I never really used the warmup) as well as a Trainer's Tips interview for each workout in which he guides you through correct form of some of the trickier exercises.  Also, don't miss the Trainer Commentary Option on which you can have Michael give a voice over on both the Primary Workout and the 5 Min. Workout.  He has a lot of important things to say, and don't worry, the music is still loud, and there is a repetition countdown on the screen, so you'll know how many reps you have left in a particular move!ABS OF ENVY - My personal favorite!  I still pull this one out from time to time, and I've owned this for over a year.  When I initially viewed this program, I was skeptical because there are only a few crunches towards the end.  However, when I did it, it was challenging, I broke a sweat, and when I went to stretch my abs at the end, they burned quite a bit! It utilizes a lot of standing abs moves, but if you concentrate on using your abs, your belly will become sculpted and flat and your waist will be cinched, giving you that hourglass effect. Done almost entirely standing with a few minutes of floorwork.BUNS OF ENVY - Uses various squats (love that Helicopter Squat!), Lunges, Reverse Lunges (called dips in The Firm) and other moves to effectively shape your glutes and thighs. Done mostly standing with some floorwork about three-quarters into the workout.LEGS OF ENVY - Uses lunges, plies, plyo jumps and even balance moves to give you shapely thighs and calves. Done entirely standing with stretching on the floor at the very end.ARMS OF ENVY - Uses bicep curls, hammer curls and some fun, creative moves such as the Dumbbell Catch and the Gecko Pushup to work your upper body. Done mostly standing with some push-up variations and floor tricep work towards the end.And Now For The Bad:  The only real detriments that I could find: One- The packaging of the DVDs. Yes, plural. All four programs, unnecessarily, are recorded onto 4 separate DVDs.  For anyone who wished to combine workouts, it can be quite annoying to have to switch DVDs and then sit through minutes of exercise advisement/legal jargon/Lionsgate material. Two-The repetiveness of the exercises.  Though I found the exercises different and fun, each program actually contains about 7 minutes of moves that are repeated at least once halfway through. Depending on your attention span and the frequency with which you use this DVD, you may get bored quickly.Three- The girls themselves.  Though I found them pleasant enough, it is obvious that these girls are not fitness professionals and were simply cast due to their looks.  Some viewers may find them a little Playboy-bunny-esque and not interesting.  I simply was inspired to attain their physiques! If they bother you, you could always choose the voiceover option by Michael , who IS a fitness professional, and a charismatic one at that.All in all, I highly recommend this DVD and don't think anyone who wants a great body will be dissapointed.",4,All-Around AWESOME Toning DVDs...!,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,4758,"['bought', 'ENVYGirls', 'hesitantly', 'had', 'previously', 'been',

I promise it's not some silly joke that will leave you regretting spending your hard-earned money.In fact, this is one of the best workout DVD's I've seen for dumbbells (arms). I ordered the series just for that 20 minute workout alone, after trying it for free on Exercise TV. (It's actually about $[...] before S+H is tacked on on the Exercise TV website.) It's recommended you get 3-5lb dumbbells I believe, which you will actually need for most of the workouts. I use 8-10lb ones, though.I saw some users complaining about the fact that it's not challenging enough. Well, I am in fairly good shape, and I found some of these moves challenging. Of course, this isn't the only exercise I get in during the week. The ab DVD alone, for example, is definitely not enough to challenge me. I use it as a warm-up and then do 100's of more reps. But that's not something one should expect a DVD to walk them through, anyway (this isn't P-90X, people).I've also found that combing the leg workout with the butt workout right after will really work the thigh & butt muscles.

1055785,A3T7MN2WPZ3M1O,B000NA78S4,Emily,"[1, 2]","CONS:-It was hard to find the trainer voice-over option. And you need to watch the trainer videos (which are a little creapy) to understand how to do the workout properly.- And some of the moves are done too fast. I started with a  5lb weight but parts of the warm up and the abs dvd go way too fast to use a 5 lb weight without injuring your elbows, so i switched to a 2 lb weight amd will see if I can work my way up.-This does display itself with a black square around it but it's nothing that's horribly aweful on a small bedroom tv and my box tv in the living roo . I don't have a new flat tv so i don't know how it works on there.-it doesn't go slow enough to get good form, i've been doing the lotte berk method muscle burns fat and the belly twins bellydance fitness for begginners basic moves so i had learned a lot about form.PROS:-oh and the cover is really cool. The girls litterally pop off the box and the squares are little mirror. My sister saw it and mentioned it looks like your suppose to imagine you'ol be like them one day, lol-Since no one mentioned this (i read almost all the reviews before i purchased this) i will say how i like that in the bottom right hand corner it always countdowns the reps, which is really helpful for me because i get worn out and end up giving up to rest only to find out there was only one or two left on other dvds.-a lot of people complained how there are 4 seperate dvds but i like that. I do 30 mins a day of good muscle workout and this keeps me on a schedule.-the scenery is beautiful and although they do switch camera angles quite often there has only been one instance where i couldn't tell what they were doing.-there is no cardio dvd, why isn't this in the con department? Because that's a good thing for me. I lose weight more when i work on my muscles and watch what goes into my mouth. But doing all these will have you huffing and puffing, partly because they don't tell you when to breath but these dvds all have a mix of muscle and cardio at the same time. (later I found out that there was origionally a 5th one with cardio that was never released)-the girls are pretty and yes some are in bikini bottoms but they're on the beach. And they are pretty but not fakey pretty. But you,ll be working out too hard to notice what they're wearing. And no it's nothing like soft-core porn like the guy from salt lake said in his review. The one who made his wife throw it out. It's justpretty girls in workout clothes for hot weather. It's not tacky and they aren't being overtly sexy or sexual. I've seen workouts that the woman actual makes faces like she's having sex! And it's way better to look at these girls curvy forms than the annoying extra peppy too-muscly women in most other dvds (if you don't believe me check out the corny crunch and dance off workouts on netflix)I always come back and update so today is 10/04/11 i weigh 228. I will be back in 8 weeks (11/29/11) to update on weight and anything else i like and didn't like. If i take pictures i'll leave a link to see the difference.UPDATE: 12/27/11 Okay so I came a little late and I'll be honest this wasn't as challenging as I thought at first. With Diet and little exercise I'm down inches and pounds. But I tried and tried but couldn't get motivated to use these dvds more than a few times. If you are thin already or just want to get a quick workout in these dvds are fine. If you are expecting something like Tonique that will wip your butt into shape...don't count on it. In the end it's great to use if you go on vacation or have little room to move around.

1055788,AVSO0JTRKXK8E,B000NA78S4,"mukhy0 ""Blah-se""","[3, 3]","This workout is good for days when you're too tired but just want to squeeze something in. The exercises will tone you but it won't help if you're trying to lose weight. Don't let the girls in their small outfits fool you. Most of the moves are effective and you will feel sore the next day. One thing I like about this video is that the moves are different from a lot of other exercise videos. It's a refreshing change from all the workout videos I've used. I don't really mind the girls. They're cute and chipper. I don't find their attire that big of a deal. I would be flaunting it too if I were in their shape! If anything, that encourages me to work harder.I break into a light sweat when I do the legs and buns exercise, but the arms and abs section are too easy for me. I use Envy Girls when I'm bored with my other videos or when I am too tired after work for something more rigorous. I wouldn't depend solely on this product to get in shape. It's just too light, but it is decent if all you need is toning.Complaints. The girls are pretty bad at cuing and explaining the form. This can be pretty frustrating for a lot of people. For me, I just copy their form. After doing the video once, you can pretty much figure out the moves the second time around. The DVD has extra clips of the trainer demonstrating and explaining some of the more trickier moves. I don't know why they didn't just use him in the video because he was so much better at explaining things than the girls. Also, the arms video concentrates too much on the triceps. My triceps were definitely sore the next day, but the rest of my arms (biceps) didn't get a workout at all! Also, if you're already in healthy shape, the abs section probably won't do anything for you.",3,A decent light workout,1268438400,"03 13, 2010",2010,1747,"['workout', 'good', 'days', 'when', ""'re"", 'too', 'tired', 'just', 'want', 'squeeze', 'something', 'exercises', 'will', 'tone', 'wo', ""n't"", 'help', ""'re"", 'trying', 'lose', 'weight', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'girls', 'small', 'outfits', 'fool', 'Most', 'moves', 'are', 'effective', 'will', 'feel', 'sore', 'next', 'day', 'One', 'thing', 'like', 'video', 'moves', 'are', 'different', 'lot', 'other', 'exercise', 'videos', 'refreshing', 'change', 'workout', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'used', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'girls', ""'re"", 'cute', 'chipper', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'attire', 'big', 'deal', 'would', 'be', 'flaunting', 'too', 'were', 'shape', 'anything', 'work', 'harder.I', 'break', 'light', 'sweat', 'when', 'do', 'legs', 'buns', 'exercise', 'arms', 'abs', 'section', 'are', 'too', 'easy', 'use', 'Envy', 'Girls', 'when', ""'m"", 'bored', 'other', 'videos', 'when', 'am', 'too', 'tired', 'work', 'something', 'more', 'rigorous', 'would', ""n't"", 'depend', 'solely', 'product', 'get', 'shape', 'just', 'too', 'light', 'decent', 'need', 'toning.Complaints', 'girls', 'are', 'pretty', 'bad', 'cuing', 'explaining', 'form', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'frustrating', 'lot', 'people', 'just', 'copy', 'form', 'doing', 'video', 'once', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'figure', 'moves', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'DVD', 'extra', 'clips', 'trainer', 'demonstrating', 'explaining', 'more', 'trickier', 'moves', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'use', 'video', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'explaining', 'things', 'girls', 'Also', 'arms', 'video', 'too', 'much', 'triceps', 'triceps', 'were', 'definitely', 'next', 'day', 'rest', 'arms', 'biceps', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'workout', 'Also', ""'re"", 'already', 'healthy', 'shape', 'abs', 'section', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything']",Envy Girls - Workouts for the Spots That Really Count

I sold it the next day...So I had low expectations with this one because female eye candy does nothing for me but I was mistaken, this is a great workout dvd set.
