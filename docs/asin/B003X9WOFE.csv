Harris ""Film aficionado""","[14, 16]","Obviously, anyone who is a fan of Daniel Tosh is going to want to pick up this extravaganza filmed before a lively San Francisco audience.  The presentation is loaded with Tosh's particular brand of wry and intelligent smut.  Definitely for adult audiences, he straddles the line of good taste and oftentimes falls on the wrong, but hilarious, side of polite humor.  Whether riffing on his girlfriend, his host city, illegal immigrants, or his more vocal opponents--Tosh's understated delivery always draws me in and then he kicks me out to left field with an unexpectedly lurid twist.  I love it....but gosh, he seems so nice and then it's a brutal skewering of everything good and decent!Some moments of inspiration include imagining a Brad Pitt and David Beckham procreation that defies political correctness as well as putting the amusing side into an amusement park decapitation.  I think he might be the devil in disguise with his innocent appeal and relaxed demeanor.  His societal observations are as spot-on as they are deadly.  Tosh is certainly one of my favorites--and not every moment of this hour long concert is perfect.  But my friends and I laughed long, hard and loudly.  This was a unqualified winner in our household.  And there is one bit of multi-tasking advice that just might revolutionize your morning routine!
