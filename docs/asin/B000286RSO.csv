Steve Reeves (Who was a good friend and work out partner of Gordan Scott.) had captured my imagination and inspired me to begin a life long love of body building/weight lifting with his portryal of, Hercules.""Sampson and the Seven Miracles of the World"" was one of the countless such films that I watched each and every Sat. afternoon. Gordon Scott has always been one of my favorite body builder turned actor. He can actually act !! He also had a build that was on a par with the late great Steeve Reeves and knew how to make the best use of those massiive lats in the scenes where he up roots trees or moves huge boulders. He knew how to make us kids think he was actually lifting something in humanly heavy. As a kid I ate it up.As an adult, I enjoyed watching this gem because I rememberd all the ""Muscle"" scenes. That was why I watched it after all to begin with. However, with dubed voices, white actors playing Mongols with little or no Mongol make up a (Sampson himself hardly looks like a native.) obviously rubber boulders, a story line that even as a kid I had trouble taking seriously, stunts that were so poor the union would have walked off the set, sets that were obviously left over from another sword and sandle saga set in a completey different culture,,,It was better in my mind or rather in a child's mind. Still, I give it five stars because as a kid I thought it was great, Gordon Scott was great in it and the ""muscle scenes are still fun to watch as I fast forward through the rest of the film to watch those.If you can suspend critical observation and slip back into the mind of a child, you ought to buy this movie. If you can't, buy it any way and fast forward away !The Shootist",5,"It was better in my mind,,,",1126483200,"09 12, 2005",2005,1838,"['viewed', 'film', 'local', 'theater', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'youngster', 'time', 'was', 'inthralled', 'things', 'sword', 'sandle', 'Steve', 'Reeves', 'Who', 'was', 'good', 'friend', 'work', 'out', 'partner', 'Gordan', 'Scott', 'had', 'captured', 'imagination', 'inspired', 'begin', 'life', 'long', 'love', 'body', 'building/weight', 'lifting', 'portryal', 'Hercules', 'Sampson', 'Seven', 'Miracles', 'World', 'was', 'one', 'countless', 'such', 'films', 'watched', 'Sat', 'afternoon', 'Gordon', 'Scott', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'body', 'builder', 'turned', 'actor', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'also', 'had', 'build', 'was', 'par', 'late', 'great', 'Steeve', 'Reeves', 'knew', 'how', 'make', 'best', 'use', 'massiive', 'lats', 'scenes', 'where', 'up', 'roots', 'trees', 'moves', 'huge', 'boulders', 'knew', 'how', 'make', 'kids', 'think', 'was', 'actually', 'lifting', 'something', 'humanly', 'heavy', 'kid', 'ate', 'adult', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'gem', 'rememberd', 'Muscle', 'scenes', 'was', 'why', 'watched', 'begin', 'However', 'dubed', 'voices', 'white', 'actors', 'playing', 'Mongols', 'little', 'Mongol', 'make', 'up', 'Sampson', 'hardly', 'native', 'obviously', 'rubber', 'boulders', 'story', 'line', 'even', 'kid', 'had', 'trouble', 'taking', 'seriously', 'stunts', 'were', 'so', 'poor', 'union', 'would', 'have', 'walked', 'off', 'set', 'sets', 'were', 'obviously', 'left', 'over', 'sword', 'sandle', 'saga', 'set', 'completey', 'different', 'culture', 'was', 'better', 'mind', 'rather', 'child', 'mind', 'Still', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'because', 'kid', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'Gordon', 'Scott', 'was', 'great', 'muscle', 'scenes', 'are', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'fast', 'forward', 'rest', 'film', 'watch', 'can', 'suspend', 'critical', 'observation', 'slip', 'back', 'mind', 'child', 'ought', 'buy', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'way', 'fast', 'forward', 'away', 'Shootist']",Samson and the Seven Miracles of the World
