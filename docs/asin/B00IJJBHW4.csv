For the other 10 you might want to look to Amazon Instant Video, until the rest of this series is released on dvd!  Also, you may want to support the show on FB for the most recent updates!**Edit 7-09-14: Walmart is now selling the dvd's in sets of 2 (with different covers, by another distributor-- ""Millennium Entertainment"").  I purchased ep's 1-4 at my local store the other night.  I also checked on Walmart's website, and ep's 5 & 6 will be released this month, and I believe 7 & 8 will be released in August.  You can pre-order both sets now.  Not only are the prices cheaper per set (I paid less than $10 for 2 ep's), but the info states there ARE English SDH (aka. Subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing), & Spanish Subtitles!  ..I thought that I'd pass that along since another reviewer said there were no subtitles/captions on this 1st release set._____________________First off, I haven't read any of the Janette Oke book series this show is named after (although from what I've read, it's not actually based on the namesake's lead characters, but rather a new book spin-off entitled ""Where Courage Calls"").  And I didn't watch the pilot movie beforehand (FYI, the lead actors aren't even the same).My initial impression/review of ep's 1-4, was a 4 star rating.  But I'm giving the entire season 5 stars, because I feel that the story lines from episodes 5-12 really take off!  Actually, some of the best moments of the season are in those episodes (ep's 9 & 12 are especially phenomenal)!!!This is my first experience with either lead actor (well, technically Miss Krakow appeared in 1 episode of a show I watch, but I can't recall her performance).I'm especially amazed at how well Mr. Lissing can conceal his accent, which I'm sure can't be easy!  Also, the chemistry between the leads seems to flow naturally, and doesn't feel contrived (despite the fact their characters get off to a rough start).If I'm being totally honest, there are a few over dramatic, and somewhat predictable moments (*slight SPOILER*: for instance when the hero ""Jack"" is ALWAYS there to save the day-- seriously, pretty soon they're going to have to sew an ""S"" onto his uniform because he's the Edwardian version of ""Clark Kent""!).But really, what does that matter when each episode has an underlying positive message, AND it's clean family friendly entertainment (a rarity these days)?!It's definitely reminiscent of ""Christy"" (one of my favorite, but sadly short-lived TV series in the mid 90's), ""Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman"", and perhaps a little of ""Anne of Green Gables"", or ""Little House on the Prairie"".My one real complaint, is that music is constantly being played during much of the dialogue and it competes with their voices (so unless you have closed caption on, you might have to replay it, and/or constantly adjust the volume)! Unfortunately, other Hallmark productions have this problem too...I conclusion, I highly recommend this for anyone who loves this genre, or are who are simply looking for something decent for the whole family to watch!**Thankfully Hallmark has renewed this series for a second season.  However, filming has yet to commence (likely in Aug. or Sept.), and the premier date circulating through the fanbase is that it won't air until likely May 2015.  The reason for that likely being a new series is set to air in Jan., and that always takes a couple of months to get through.  So unless Hallmark decides to air more than one original series at a time, fans might be waiting a good while yet for it to start up again.  But at least we have another season to look forward to!

1694244,A385SBEEJ15HHJ,B00IJJBHW4,Cindy Navarro,"[4, 5]","When Calls The Heart: Lost and Found is the first episode of a series that began on the Hallmark Channel Jan. 11, 2014. Based on the Canadian West novels of Janette Oke, but not an adaptation of the books. There was also a television movie that debuted last year that tied the 2 together a bit closer. I saw that movie and loved it. It also caused a bit of confusion at the beginning of this dvd for me since there was a change in the lead actress, a new Canadian Mountie, and the ending of the movie had been changed to reflect the new direction the series is taking. Also, a couple of other scenes from the movie had been reused with slight alterations. However, I quickly adapted and quit trying to compare the two.The drama of a small town coming to grips with the disaster of a mine collapse and the deaths of so manyhusbands, fathers, sons, relatives, and friends could easily become maudlin, but there are enough elements of comedy and romance to soften the harsh realities. While Elizabeth and Daniel may be the main focus, the story of the townspeople weaves through this a fascinating drama. The determination of the women to do whatever it takes to support their families and give them options, the children trying to adapt to their loss, and everyone in the town trying to come to terms with their new normal.The characters are well developed and each seems to have the determination and strength to get through no matter what comes their way. I do think it a little odd that even the weakest of them aren't more prone to give-up, but this is only episode 1. The character that I thought was the best written was the &#34;villian&#34; of the piece...the mine supervisor. There are times when he is does the wrong thing, but I felt that the very nature of his job would make him have to be a bit cold-hearted in making some decisions.Altogether, really balanced storyline, characters that you will come to care about, delightful scenery, and you are left wanting to know more of the story at the end of the episode. The fact that my grandfather and a couple of uncles were coalminers gave this an additional fascination for me, but would have kept my attention anyway. Not quite a 5 star for me, but certainly a 4.5. I definitely recommend this particular dvd, and I am sure that the others will live up to the hope I have for this series.Thank you to Edify Media and Word Entertainment for providing me with a copy of this dvd for review purposes.

I was in a hurry to read it, because I knew I had this movie to watch and review.  Well, I didn't need to hurry.Have you heard the old line, &#34;The names have been changed to protect the innocent&#34;?  Well, in this case, the names were almost the only thing that weren't changed!  Elizabeth was still the new teacher in Coal Valley, and  Jack Thornton was the constable for Coal Valley.  There was a single scene involving chalk dust that was in the book, but that's where the similarity ends.  I thought that this movie was a sequel to the first movie.  I thought the book was a sequel to the first movie.  Maybe they both are but with completely different story lines.  So, if you're a read-the-book then watch the movie person, be forewarned.  You can read about this movie in the official synopsis below.  It is my understanding that this movie is part of the When Calls the Heart television series.MY THOUGHTS:Things I liked:~ The acting was good.~ Good chemistry between Elizabeth and Jack.~ Good variety of support characters.~ Clean family film.~ No bad language, love scenes, or violence.Things I didn't like:~ They didn't follow the book at all.~ Although the actress playing Elizabeth was good, I didn't like changing the main character. The new Elizabeth was too different in my mind.~ I found that the women working in the coal mine was a completely unrealistic transfer of 21st century women's behavior to early 20th century women.The bottom line:Would I recommend it?  Yes.  It was a film my entire family enjoyed.  I enjoyed it, too, after I realized it was a different story.Four stars",4,Good family film but doesn't follow the story in the book.,1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,1742,"['Last', 'week', 'reviewed', 'book', 'Where', 'Courage', 'Calls', 'story', 'Elizabeth', 'Thatcher', 'arrived', 'Coal', 'Valley', 'teach', 'school', 'was', 'hurry', 'read', 'knew', 'had', 'movie', 'watch', 'review', 'Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'hurry.Have', 'heard', 'old', 'line', '34', 'names', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'protect', 'innocent', '34', 'Well', 'case', 'names', 'were', 'almost', 'only', 'thing', 'were', ""n't"", 'changed', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'still', 'new', 'teacher', 'Coal', 'Valley', 'Jack', 'Thornton', 'was', 'constable', 'Coal', 'Valley', 'was', 'single', 'scene', 'involving', 'chalk', 'dust', 'was', 'book', 'where', 'similarity', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'sequel', 'first', 'movie', 'thought', 'book', 'was', 'sequel', 'first', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'story', 'lines', 'So', ""'re"", 'read-the-book', 'then', 'watch', 'movie', 'person', 'be', 'forewarned', 'can', 'read', 'movie', 'official', 'synopsis', 'understanding', 'movie', 'part', 'When', 'Heart', 'television', 'series.MY', 'THOUGHTS', 'Things', 'liked', '~', 'acting', 'was', 'good.~', 'Good', 'chemistry', 'Elizabeth', 'Jack.~', 'Good', 'variety', 'support', 'characters.~', 'Clean', 'family', 'bad', 'language', 'love', 'scenes', 'violence.Things', 'did', ""n't"", '~', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'book', 'all.~', 'actress', 'playing', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'changing', 'main', 'character', 'new', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'too', 'different', 'mind.~', 'found', 'women', 'working', 'coal', 'mine', 'was', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'transfer', '21st', 'century', 'women', 'behavior', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'women.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Would', 'recommend', 'Yes', 'was', 'film', 'entire', 'family', 'enjoyed', 'enjoyed', 'too', 'realized', 'was', 'different', 'story.Four', 'stars']",When Calls the Heart - Lost & Found DVD

So when Hallmark starting making series and movies inspired by her books I was excited about it! I learned quickly, however, that &#8220;inspired by&#8221; means just that&#8211;these might have the same titles and character names, but the stories in the movies/series are very loosely based on the books. They are great in and of themselves, but if you are expecting a great book to tv adaptation you&#8217;re going to become disappointed quickly. I learned this with the Love Come Softly movie series, so going into watching When Calls the Heart &#8211; Lost & Found DVD I was expecting something similar, and I was right. This DVD is actually the first 2 episodes in the When Calls the Heart Series&#8211;so don&#8217;t expect the full season. It&#8217;s just enough to give you a great taste for the series and leaves you wanting more.The story focuses around Elizabeth Thatcher&#8211;a starry eyed rich girl who goes to a rough and  tumble coal town that just suffered a devastating tragedy and who expects to change the world overnight by being the best teacher to the town&#8217;s children that she can be. Erin Krakow plays the character well, although some of the mistakes she makes at first are a bit silly&#8211;even for a &#8220;spoiled rich girl&#8221;. Also somewhat predictable is the &#8220;oh-I-hate-you-now-but-you-can-tell-we&#8217;ll-fall-in-love-in-the-end&#8221; storyline between Elizabeth and the one, new, handsome eligible Mountie Jack Thornton; though I will give credit that even just in the first two episodes they work the changes in both directions in a believable and gradual manner, which is better than many movies and books which have a similar situation happen.Characters like Abigail Stanton add a richness and depth to the plot line, and by the end of the second episode you find yourself pulling for the people of Coal Valley and anxious to see how their stories will play out. The acting was all great and the product value was wonderful&#8211;lots of gorgeous shots, settings, and costumes.If you loved the Love Comes Softly movie series or are just looking for some quality, family friendly entertainment then you will very much enjoy this DVD and series!",4,If you enjoy Halmark movies then you'll love this series!,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,2312,"['Ever', 'first', 'read', 'Love', 'Comes', 'Softly', 'Series', 'teen', '8217', 'loved', 'Janette', 'Oke', '8217', 'books', 'So', 'when', 'Hallmark', 'starting', 'making', 'series', 'movies', 'inspired', 'books', 'was', 'excited', 'learned', 'quickly', 'however', '8220', 'inspired', '8221', 'just', '8211', 'might', 'have', 'same', 'titles', 'character', 'names', 'stories', 'movies/series', 'are', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'books', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'expecting', 'great', 'book', 'tv', 'adaptation', '8217', 're', 'going', 'become', 'disappointed', 'quickly', 'learned', 'Love', 'Come', 'Softly', 'movie', 'series', 'going', 'watching', 'When', 'Calls', 'Heart', '8211', 'Lost', 'Found', 'DVD', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'similar', 'was', 'right', 'DVD', 'actually', 'first', '2', 'episodes', 'When', 'Heart', 'Series', '8211', 'don', '8217', 'expect', 'full', 'season', '8217', 's', 'just', 'enough', 'give', 'great', 'taste', 'series', 'wanting', 'more.The', 'story', 'Elizabeth', 'Thatcher', '8211', 'starry', 'eyed', 'rich', 'girl', 'who', 'rough', 'tumble', 'coal', 'town', 'just', 'suffered', 'devastating', 'tragedy', 'who', 'change', 'world', 'overnight', 'being', 'best', 'teacher', 'town', '8217', 'children', 'can', 'be', 'Erin', 'Krakow', 'character', 'well', 'mistakes', 'first', 'are', 'bit', 'silly', '8211', 'even', '8220', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'girl', '8221', 'Also', 'somewhat', 'predictable', '8220', 'oh-I-hate-you-now-but-you-can-tell-we', '8217', 'll-fall-in-love-in-the-end', '8221', 'storyline', 'Elizabeth', 'one', 'new', 'handsome', 'eligible', 'Mountie', 'Jack', 'Thornton', 'will', 'give', 'credit', 'even', 'just', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'work', 'changes', 'directions', 'believable', 'gradual', 'manner', 'better', 'many', 'movies', 'books', 'have', 'similar', 'situation', 'happen.Characters', 'Abigail', 'Stanton', 'richness', 'depth', 'plot', 'line', 'end', 'second', 'episode', 'find', 'pulling', 'people', 'Coal', 'Valley', 'anxious', 'see', 'how', 'stories', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'product', 'value', 'was', 'wonderful', '8211', 'lots', 'gorgeous', 'shots', 'settings', 'costumes.If', 'loved', 'Love', 'Comes', 'Softly', 'movie', 'series', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'quality', 'family', 'friendly', 'entertainment', 'then', 'will', 'very', 'much', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'series']",When Calls the Heart - Lost & Found DVD

1694253,A8N3FYDA2VUYY,B00IJJBHW4,"Pirate2240 ""Kat""","[9, 10]","I've been completely addicted to this series since I watched the original movie When Calls The Heart. Then I was excited to learn that the Hallmark Channel had decided to pick this one up as a series and continue the story from best selling author Janette Oke. In this DVD, When Calls The Heart: Lost and Found, we find that Elizabeth Thatcher has left her wealthy and prominent life to journey west to become a teacher in Coal Valley. She believes despite all her father's misgivings she can do what they believe she can't. Armed with nothing more than her clothes and some books, she is soon the victim of a stage coach robbery that leaves her with little more than the clothes on her back. She arrives at the request of the women of Coal Valley that have suffered the loss of their husbands and older children in a mining explosion. Their only hope is that Elizabeth can educate their children so that they don't have to become miners when they grow up.But Elizabeth isn't at all prepared for what she is hoping for and thus no matter how hard she struggles to fit in, she is more of a challenge than she thinks. From learning to deal with issues that the children are facing to establishing the school in a saloon during the day, there are numerous laughs to be found along the way. Elizabeth's biggest ally is Abigail  Stanton who has lost both her husband and son in the mining explosion. Yet both women persevere despite all the odds against them. Abigail dispenses motherly wisdom to Elizabeth when she feels overcome by the challenges facing her on the frontier and the two become friends.Jack Thornton arrives as someone Elizabeth's father has hired to watch over his daughter while she insists on taking up the teaching in Coal Valley. Soon the sparks fly between the two even though they fight the attraction brewing between them. Yet after some time, Elizabeth soon discovers that Jack is more than just a friend and the harder they try to fight their romantic feelings the more they each are drawn closer together.I received When Calls the Heart: Lost and Found compliments of Word Films, The Hallmark Channel and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for my honest review and the opinions expressed are strictly my own unless otherwise noted.
