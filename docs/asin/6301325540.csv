249732,ALTJKDWT2B1GB,6301325540,James,"[0, 0]","They Were ExpendableShot during the closing weeks of WWII, They Were Expendable is the somewhat real life story of the American defeat in the Philippines as seen through the eyes of the men of a PT boat squadron commanded by Lt. John Bulkeley (called Brickley in the film and played by Robert Montgomery) and his second in command Lt. Robert Kelly (named Rusty Ryan played by John Wayne). The concept of PT boat warfare is a new idea to the navy and the men are given limited assignments. The movie was directed by Capt. John Ford USNR and based on a screenplay by Cmdr. Frank (Spig) Wead, USN who became the subject of another John Ford movie entitled The Wings of Eagles (1957).There is no elaborate plot to the film, no Hollywood drama here, no special effects, no plot twisting events, just ordinary men doing an ordinary job under difficult times. It is simply the story of men trying to survive on a day to day basis in wartime. They are having to cope with the loss of their fellow crewmen and the defeat which they can sense is coming as the United States slowly retreats from the Philippine Islands. These men are meant to buy time, a delaying action, until the United States can gather its forces for all out war.There is little or no real emphasis on combat scenes and the scenes are limited, almost as if they were unintended. The minor characters of the film (the men of the PT boat crews) are hard to follow in that their speaking parts are limited, making remembering them as individuals difficult. Donna Reed's character, Sandy an army nurse, really wasn't worth the extra scenes given to her but is more in tune with Ford's having to have a romantic character in the text of the film. The film is worth seeing, giving the viewer an incite into early days of WWII.Flying LeathernecksIt's Marines, Marines and more Marines in this action adventure of WWII. John Wayne and Robert Ryan star as the commander and executive officer of VFM 247 fighter squadron assigned to fight it out on the island of Guadalcanal with close air support for ground troops, but Wayne and Ryan are constantly at odds as to how to manage this group of young college aviators. The movie resembles the story of Pappy Boyington and the Black Sheep squadron, VMF 214, but with more antagonism and less humor. There is plenty of action in this movie and lots of authentic combat footage.Wayne and Ryan are not at their best in this movie for they simply do not fit the profile of typical Marine officers and the story line tends to drag. If you like action movies with plenty of combat, then this movie will please you. If you are looking for more of a story about historical events then this film may disappoint but its worth a one time see.

Second, we see the agonies of command.John Wayne is a major who is not always liked by his subordinates.

249737,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,6301325540,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","This white and black film made in 1951 tells the story of airmen of US Marines Corps during the battles of Guadalcanal (August 1942-February 1943) and later Okinawa (April-June 1945). John Wayne and Robert Ryan play two main roles.The film begins with Major Daniel X. Kirby (John Wayne) arriving with new planes and pilots on Henderson Field, the only airfield Americans have on Guadalcanal. Kirby is also there to take command of the fighter squadron based on Henderson Field, much to the disappointment of almost all the pilots who hoped this post will go the very popular Captain Carl Griffin (Robert Ryan). But as the battle of Guadalcanal goes on and butcher's bill increases, there will be finally little time for personal grudges... Much later, the few survivors of this desperate battle will meet again during the bloody Okinawa campaign, during which they will fly better planes, but also face hundreds of Japanese fighters and kamikazes...This is a very honest, solid war film, made in this pretty jingoistic style characteristic to the movies from 40s and 50s. This film is inspired by real events and tries seriously to stick to historical realities. John Wayne's character (Major Kirby) was modeled on a real person - Major John L. Smith, an ace who downed 19 Japanese fighters and bombers during the Guadalcanal campaign flying from Henderson Field and who received later Medal of Honor for this achievement.American air units on Guadalcanal were nicknamed Cactus Air Force, from the coded name ""Cactus"" given to Guadalcanal during the campaign. The bloody and by moments pretty desperate fight waged by airplanes operating from Henderson Field is really well described in ""Flying Leathernecks"". The fight in the air was not always the most dangerous part - Henderson Field was almost daily subject to bombing and strafing by Japanese air planes operating from Rabaul and Buka airbases and almost every night Japanese warships shelled American airbase. The Japanese had also in the monutains of Guadalcanal a couple of heavy long range guns (naval pieces mounted on wheels) which kept a daily schedule of slow rate irregular firing on Henderson Field - by avoiding any fire patterns they made certain that pilots and mechanicians who ventured on the airfield in the open could never know if it was not precisely the moment when a heavy shell was already on its way towards them... The always present threat of this ""death from above"" is also well shown in this film.Relations between people and dialogs are pretty good. Kirby is the lonely guy in charge, who must press his men to give the maximum, knowing that as a result many of them will die. Griffin is a more human, more compassionate character - but exactly for that reason he is not the right person to command in such a terrible, long battle. This weakness of character will finally catch up with him much later during the battle of Okinawa, in an absolutely devastating manner...There is some humor in the film, mostly provided by Master Sergeant Clancy, the chief mechanician of fighter squadron, able to repair virtually any damaged plane. He is also the greatest thief of fuel and spare parts on Guadalcanal and the most feared serial pilferer of food, cloth and liquor warehouses in all Pacific War Theatre! The fate will also catch up with him ultimately...)))US Air Force offered generous support to make this film and as a result we can see some good air sequences - also, some real World War II footage was included in the film. However, in one point the film had to differ from reality - in 1942 Cactus Air Force fighters were Grumman F4 Wildcats, but in 1951 there were no more even one such a plane operational in US Air Force or US Navy, and therefore the planes we see in the film are more modern and more powerful Grumman F6 Hellcats. On another hand, for Okinawa battle in 1945, US Marines air units used Vought F4 Corsairs and in 1951 there were still hundreds of those available - and therefore we can see them in also in this film.In conclusion, this is a good war film, still very watchable, sticking pretty close to the historical truth and definitely a must for all John Wayne's fans - however it never was exactly an immortal masterpiece and it also aged a tiny little bit. Still I liked it.

Bagnolo ""Slugger/BIGGUY""","[4, 4]","THEY WERE EXPENDABLEMaybe because I was just a little kid, and the war was still raging, (1945) but nearing an end. Maybe it was partially because my grandfather took me to see this movie as he took me to see other movies every Saturday, and maybe it was because my Polio was gone and I could walk and run again, but mostly because my uncle was the skipper of a PT boat and knew JFK. Great Direction by John Ford, with his regular crew plus Robert Montgomery, (John Wayne, Donna Reed, Ward Bond) and many other great stars gave outstanding performances in an authentic, tropic ambiance displayed convincingly, though in Black and white.The missions, struggles, disappointments, amiable characters just doing a very tough, under-appreciated job in plywood PT boat's which the navy and marines didn't entirely trust.The secondary question was; would Monty and The Duke bring home a winner, or switch to submarines?This is a short intro of the coming of age of a PT boat fleet, the hopelessness that hung like a black cloud of Damocles just above the heads of the officers and grunts in what then seemed a losing effort, but one in which they kept grinding on with the stiff-upper lip, hard bitten, toughness of ordinary men and women doing extraordinary things.At this point in the war, the US was not yet winning, and beneath the surface the fighting men and women worried, more about whose fate was unknown than themselves. The milieu and attitudes of the characters gave one a feeling of what it really must have been like in those dark times. When my uncle came back from action a year later, he said it was one of his favorite war films-authentic and revealing.FLYING LEATHERNECKSThe second film, made in 1951, which was filmed in Technicolor, Flying Leather Necks, directed by Nicolas Ray and starring Wayne, Robert Ryan and an excellent supporting cast, was a typical fighter pilot film, well done, filled with the conflicts, misunderstandings, emotional struggles with tensions of death and mistakes and orders which are hard to follow at times. A good film but less of a classic than the Black and white above. Besides all of that, one Great film, one good film and a terrific price. By the way, this movie borrows just a bit of its plot from a 1938 Howard Hawks directed, Errol Flynn, vehicle: Dawn Patrol. The rankling relationship of Wayne with Robert Ryan, is almost parallel to Flynn's relationship to his commanding officer, Basil Rathbone. Except in this film, the roles are reversed. Here, the leading man, Wayne is the commander,  and Ryan his second in command. However, in Dawn Patrol, the underling, Flynn is the leading man and co-star Rathbone his commander.",5,One of 10 best war movies ever,1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,2679,"['THEY', 'WERE', 'EXPENDABLEMaybe', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'kid', 'war', 'was', 'still', 'raging', '1945', 'nearing', 'end', 'was', 'partially', 'grandfather', 'took', 'see', 'movie', 'took', 'see', 'other', 'movies', 'Saturday', 'maybe', 'was', 'Polio', 'was', 'gone', 'could', 'walk', 'run', 'again', 'mostly', 'uncle', 'was', 'skipper', 'PT', 'boat', 'knew', 'JFK', 'Great', 'Direction', 'John', 'Ford', 'regular', 'crew', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'stars', 'gave', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'authentic', 'tropic', 'ambiance', 'displayed', 'convincingly', 'Black', 'white.The', 'missions', 'struggles', 'disappointments', 'amiable', 'characters', 'just', 'doing', 'very', 'tough', 'under-appreciated', 'job', 'plywood', 'PT', 'boat', 'navy', 'marines', 'did', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'trust.The', 'secondary', 'question', 'was', 'would', 'Monty', 'Duke', 'bring', 'home', 'winner', 'switch', 'submarines', 'short', 'intro', 'coming', 'age', 'PT', 'boat', 'fleet', 'hopelessness', 'hung', 'black', 'cloud', 'Damocles', 'just', 'heads', 'officers', 'grunts', 'what', 'then', 'seemed', 'losing', 'effort', 'one', 'kept', 'grinding', 'stiff-upper', 'lip', 'hard', 'bitten', 'toughness', 'ordinary', 'men', 'women', 'doing', 'extraordinary', 'things.At', 'point', 'war', 'US', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'winning', 'surface', 'fighting', 'men', 'women', 'worried', 'more', 'fate', 'was', 'unknown', 'milieu', 'attitudes', 'characters', 'gave', 'one', 'feeling', 'what', 'really', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'dark', 'times', 'When', 'uncle', 'came', 'back', 'action', 'year', 'later', 'said', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'war', 'films-authentic', 'LEATHERNECKSThe', 'second', 'film', 'made', '1951', 'was', 'filmed', 'Technicolor', 'Flying', 'Leather', 'Necks', 'directed', 'Nicolas', 'Ray', 'starring', 'Wayne', 'Robert', 'Ryan', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'typical', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'filled', 'conflicts', 'misunderstandings', 'emotional', 'struggles', 'tensions', 'death', 'mistakes', 'orders', 'are', 'hard', 'follow', 'times', 'good', 'film', 'less', 'classic', 'Black', 'white', 'above', 'one', 'Great', 'film', 'one', 'good', 'film', 'terrific', 'price', 'way', 'movie', 'just', 'bit', 'plot', '1938', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'directed', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'vehicle', 'Dawn', 'Patrol', 'rankling', 'relationship', 'Wayne', 'Robert', 'Ryan', 'almost', 'parallel', 'Flynn', 'relationship', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'film', 'roles', 'are', 'reversed', 'Here', 'leading', 'man', 'Wayne', 'commander', 'Ryan', 'second', 'command', 'However', 'Dawn', 'Patrol', 'underling', 'Flynn', 'leading', 'man', 'co-star', 'Rathbone', 'commander']",Flying Leathernecks VHS

The Duke plays Major Daniel Kirby, a new squadron leader who tries to get the men into fighting shape as he tries to prove his theory of ground attacks heavily supported by air support.  Kirby and his executive officer, Captain Griffin butt heads as they argue over how to treat the men.  The plot might sound familiar to Sands of Iwo Jima which it is, but it is still a quality movie.  The aerial shots are taken from actual WWII footage that work pretty well with the shots of the actors in their planes.  The story is fairly predictable, but it is still worth a watch if nothing else.John Wayne is pretty good as tough as nails Major Kirby, a role very similar to his role as Sergeant Stryker that earned him a Best Actor nomination.  Robert Ryan gives a decent performance as Captain Griffin, who Kirby believes is not ready to take over command of the squadron.  Wayne and Ryan work well together throughout.  Don Taylor plays Griffin's brother-in-law and fellow squadron member.  Jay C. Flippen has a very funny role as Master Sergeant Clancy, Kirby's line chief who has a talent for taking things that are just lying around.
