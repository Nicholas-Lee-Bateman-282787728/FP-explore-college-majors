I thought it might be along the lines of the ""I Love the 80's"" rip-offs that just were released.But then I did some research and found there will be some cool ""special features"" on these, including a full-length commentary on ""The Breakfast Club"" from Anthony Michael Hall and Judd Nelson!  I wish there were commentaries on the other two, but at least there will be a featurette or two.Would I have preferred these were on the ""High School Reunion"" releases, of course!

761874,A2H1QA1Z1TZI6S,B0000A98ZQ,"belvis ""i don't have one""","[19, 20]","I think we should all just pretend that John Hughes died tragically in 1990, shortly after working on the brilliant ""Uncle Buck.""  He was not at all involved in such films as ""Baby's Day Out"" or ""Home Alone 3.""  He did, however, make several great movies in the 1980s, including ""Sixteen Candles,"" ""The Breakfast Club,"" and ""Weird Science,"" the films enclosed in this lovely collection.A lot of people have been very critical of the inclusion of ""Weird Science"" in this collection, but I am not one of them.  It's true that this is not really a Brat Pack movie, but it is a John Hughes '80s film, and it is great.  It's also the third movie he directed.  ""The Breakfast Club"" is the second.  ""Sixteen Candles"" is the first.  So, basically, this collection gives us the first three classics that John Hughes brought us, so I don't see the problem.""Sixteen Candles"" (1984): This will always be my favorite of the John Hughes movies.  It's a bonafide classic of the '80s with wonderful performances from Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall.  This is my favorite because it's really funny (Long Duk Dong especially, and Anthony Michael Hall's team of geeks) but also sorta touching.  Anyone can identify with Samantha Baker's sadness, and how she doesn't really know  why she's sad, just that she is sad.  That's really quite touching, in my opinion.  There are some great scenes, like the one between Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall in the shop room, or when Molly Ringwald and her dad (Paul Dooley, recently on ""Desperate Housewives"") have a nice conversation at night in the living room.  It's scenes like this that make the movie truly great, more so than other teen movies.""The Breakfast Club"" (1985): While not my favorite of the John Hughes films, this is also a classic and quite possibly the most famous of his work.  I'm a sophomore in high school, and I still hear people talking about this one all the time, which proves just how enduring and timeless the work of John Hughes really is.  This movie is a wonderful ensemble with great work from Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall, and especially Judd Nelson.  Also, Paul Gleason is the perfect jackass.  Great '80s fun with plenty of touching moments and a wonderful ending.""Weird Science"" (1985): This is just plain wacky fun.  It's different in style from the other two films in this collection, but I love it just as much.  It's crazy and wild and out of control and it's just great.  Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan-Mitchell Smith make the perfect geeks, and Kelly LeBrock is so wonderfully sexy.  A noteable part of this movie is the incredible Oingo Boingo theme song, ""Weird Science,"" which is just about the coolest song ever.So, what about this set?  It should be noted that the three disks in this collection are the same three disks from the previously released ""High School Reunion Collection,"" and even come with an ad for that collection.  The quality is great.  The movies are all remastered in anamorphic widescreen and look beautiful.  The cool thing is that ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""Weird Science"" come with their original theatrical soundtracks and not the changed VHS soundtracks, which is really nice.The thing that makes this collection distictive is definately the gorgeous binder package.  Looking at the above picture is not the same as really seeing it.  This is just a beautiful piece of art.  It really is a binder, with clasps and everything, and the movies enclosed in little slips on the clasps.  It's truly lovely and looks very noteable on the shelf.This set also comes with an extra CD featuring eight great '80s songs, including ""True"" (Spandau Ballet), ""If You Leave"" (Orchestral Maneuvers In The Dark), ""Weird Science"" (Oingo Boingo), ""Oh Yeah"" (Yello),"" and ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"" (Simple Minds).  This set is definately worth buying for this CD.  I listen to it all the time.  I love these songs, so much, and each one is good, although my favorite is by far ""If You Leave,"" followed closely by ""Weird Science.""  Trust me, if you get this set, you'll find yourself listening to this CD all the time.  It's just great.So, the only thing that this set lacks is special features.  I for one was very dissapointed to see that none of the deleted scenes from the TV versions of the film made it here.  All three have some footage that can only be seen on TV, but Universal was not generous enough to bestow it upon us, which is a shame.  Basically, there's nothing here in the way of special features, except for trailers on ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Weird Science.""  So, if you're into special feautres, you'll be severely dissapointed.However, aside from that, this set is great.  All three movies are '80s classics, and they're presented with their original soundtracks, in a lovely special case, with a wonderful music disk.  How can you say no?

761875,A3KMTOFTUUNFHG,B0000A98ZQ,Brett D. Cullum,"[7, 7]","First off, these are the same editions as found in THE HIGH SCHOOL REUNION COLLECTION set of DVDs.  If you own those - no need to double dip.  The transfers are the same, no extras, and yes... these are only the Universal owned ""Brat Pack"" movies.  Nothing has been changed to the three movies proper.  Original soundtracks are here for SIXTEEN CANDLES and WEIRD SCIENCE (tv versions often replace many of the songs, as did the VHS copies).  All of them are in enhanced widescreen with 5.1 sound mixes.The packaging is indeed a very cool little 3-ring binder.  It includes an 8 song CD with the following songs:""True"" Spandau Ballet""Tenderness"" - General Public""If You Leave"" -OMD""Weird Science"" Oingo Boingo""Oh Yeah"" Yello""Pretty in Pink"" - The Psychedelic Furs (the soundtrack version not original recording)""Don't You (Forget About Me)"" - Simple Minds""I Go Crazy"" - Flesh for LuluIf you bought them the first time around I would suggest just heading over to iTunes or a similar service and downloading the 8 songs for less than $8.  If you didn't buy the set the first time then it's a neat repackage, and will be a fun item for collectors and fans.  I do like the packaging a lot, but it is bigger than your average DVD case - so it won't fit easily in a holder if you have one that conforms to the standard release size.The films are GREAT!  SIXTEEN CANDLES, THE BREAKFAST CLUB, and WEIRD SCIENCE are all fun even after two decades.  They don't make teen movies like this anymore, and all three films are like totally awesome.  I can't see anyone having a problem with what's here.  Sure, it's not the ENTIRE ""Brat Pack"", but it's most of them.

761876,A1ELVOQTTWNLJ1,B0000A98ZQ,Cameron Johnson,"[1, 9]","There is nothing to complain about the packaging. The three movies come in a very durable, pseudo-high-school style mini-binder, which is very durable and also will fit in nicely on any DVD shelf. Since this is a ""collection"" I thought there would be more extra features - you know, commentary, featurettes, that kind of thing. But the extras are mainly just the theatrical trailers. So that was disappointing, but not completely devastating.I saw Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club on TV a few times, enjoyed them, and received this collection as a gift from a friend. By the time I received this gift, I hadn't seen either movie in quite a few years. So I was excited to watch them again.SPOILER ALERTAnd I was disappointed. Sixteen Candles has the totally pointless asian exchange student (or whatever) as a character, proving that John Hughes apparently thought that depicting ""foreigners"" as gibberish speaking idiots was the height of comedy. We also have the hugely illogical ending, which is Jake Ryan falling for Molly Ringwald, a girl he never talks to, doesn't know at all, and isn't even part of the same circle of friends. It's this very strange decision he comes to that basically boils down to - ""I am deciding that I like Samantha Baker now because I found a piece of paper that said she was a virgin [titillating!] and, being a male of the dumber variety, now perceive my current girlfriend as a slut, therefore not girlfriend material, which is totally logical since she is having sex with me.""The Breakfast Club was even more disappointing since it had a lot of potential - five students, in detention, all bond and realize that, amazingly, they all kind of like each other, and high school cliques are stupid. Unfortunately, the way they all pair off is a little baffling. First, Princess goes after Bad Boy; wow, I certainly didn't see that coming from a mile away. Wonder how long that relationship is going to last? Then, Princess gives Goth Girl a makeover (for some unexplained reason), which causes Jock to actually speak to Goth Girl, and, of course, kiss her. What a wonderful message - if you're a girl, let some prissy popular girl make you look exactly like her, and some dumb jock (with Daddy issues) will treat you like a person instead of a piece of furniture. Aw, the power of inner beauty. The Geek, of course, gets left out of all of this romantic pairing up, because everyone knows that geeks can't ever have girlfriends; geeks are also all guys. Considering their shared status as social pariahs, you'd think it would make more sense for the Geek and Goth Girl to pair up, but then poor Emilio Estevez would left out, and leaving an attractive person without a potential date is just too unrealistic, even for a teen movie.There's not much I can say about Weird Science. The premise is ridiculous, and more than a little misogynistic. Did John Hughes just get off a bad breakup or something when he agreed to direct this? Women are either social-ladder climbing shrews (the jocks' girlfriends) or perfect goddesses (Lisa, the ""computer-generated"" woman). What makes even less sense is that after a violent standoff, where the Geeks act all manly, the girls, who previously dated the jocks, now wrap themselves around the Geeks. So...now the Geeks have girlfriends! So now Lisa has absolutely no purpose, so she conveniently leaves. Weird Science is, by far, the very worst of these three movies.Hence the 2 star rating. Now, if you've already seen these movies, and you already like them, then I would highly recommend you purchase this. It's very cute and nostalgic. I, however, after receiving this as a gift, realized how awful all three of these movies actually are. The 80's must have been a low point in quality film with realistic, sympathetic characters that one could relate to, because John Hughes has been held up as some sort of King of the Teenage Experience, and if that's how he sees the teenage experience...well, the guy has a seriously selective memory, then.",2,Not Good Movies,1305072000,"05 11, 2011",2011,4020,"['nothing', 'complain', 'packaging', 'three', 'movies', 'come', 'very', 'durable', 'pseudo-high-school', 'style', 'mini-binder', 'very', 'durable', 'also', 'will', 'fit', 'nicely', 'DVD', 'shelf', 'collection', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'extra', 'features', 'know', 'commentary', 'featurettes', 'kind', 'thing', 'extras', 'are', 'mainly', 'just', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'was', 'disappointing', 'not', 'completely', 'devastating.I', 'saw', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'TV', 'few', 'times', 'enjoyed', 'received', 'collection', 'gift', 'friend', 'time', 'received', 'gift', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'either', 'movie', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'So', 'was', 'excited', 'watch', 'again.SPOILER', 'ALERTAnd', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'totally', 'pointless', 'asian', 'exchange', 'student', 'character', 'proving', 'John', 'Hughes', 'apparently', 'thought', 'depicting', 'foreigners', 'gibberish', 'speaking', 'idiots', 'was', 'height', 'comedy', 'also', 'have', 'hugely', 'illogical', 'ending', 'Jake', 'Ryan', 'falling', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'girl', 'never', ""n't"", 'know', ""n't"", 'even', 'part', 'same', 'circle', 'friends', 'very', 'strange', 'decision', 'basically', 'down', 'am', 'deciding', 'like', 'Samantha', 'Baker', 'now', 'found', 'piece', 'paper', 'said', 'was', 'virgin', '[', 'titillating', ']', 'being', 'male', 'dumber', 'variety', 'now', 'perceive', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'slut', 'therefore', 'not', 'girlfriend', 'material', 'totally', 'logical', 'having', 'sex', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'disappointing', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'five', 'students', 'detention', 'bond', 'realize', 'amazingly', 'kind', 'other', 'high', 'school', 'cliques', 'are', 'stupid', 'Unfortunately', 'way', 'pair', 'off', 'little', 'baffling', 'First', 'Princess', 'Bad', 'Boy', 'wow', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'Wonder', 'how', 'long', 'relationship', 'going', 'last', 'Then', 'Princess', 'Goth', 'Girl', 'makeover', 'unexplained', 'reason', 'Jock', 'actually', 'speak', 'Goth', 'Girl', 'course', 'kiss', 'What', 'wonderful', 'message', ""'re"", 'girl', 'let', 'prissy', 'popular', 'girl', 'make', 'look', 'exactly', 'dumb', 'jock', 'Daddy', 'issues', 'will', 'treat', 'person', 'instead', 'piece', 'furniture', 'Aw', 'power', 'inner', 'beauty', 'Geek', 'course', 'left', 'romantic', 'pairing', 'up', 'everyone', 'geeks', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'have', 'girlfriends', 'geeks', 'are', 'also', 'guys', 'Considering', 'shared', 'status', 'social', 'pariahs', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'Geek', 'Goth', 'Girl', 'pair', 'up', 'then', 'poor', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'would', 'left', 'out', 'leaving', 'attractive', 'person', 'potential', 'date', 'just', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'even', 'teen', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'say', 'Weird', 'Science', 'premise', 'ridiculous', 'more', 'little', 'misogynistic', 'Did', 'John', 'Hughes', 'just', 'get', 'off', 'bad', 'breakup', 'something', 'when', 'agreed', 'direct', 'Women', 'are', 'social-ladder', 'climbing', 'shrews', 'jocks', 'girlfriends', 'perfect', 'goddesses', 'Lisa', 'computer-generated', 'woman', 'What', 'even', 'less', 'sense', 'violent', 'standoff', 'where', 'Geeks', 'act', 'manly', 'girls', 'who', 'previously', 'dated', 'jocks', 'now', 'Geeks', 'now', 'Geeks', 'have', 'girlfriends', 'So', 'now', 'Lisa', 'absolutely', 'purpose', 'conveniently', 'Weird', 'Science', 'far', 'very', 'worst', 'three', 'movies.Hence', '2', 'star', 'rating', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'movies', 'already', 'then', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'very', 'cute', 'nostalgic', 'however', 'receiving', 'gift', 'realized', 'how', 'awful', 'three', 'movies', 'actually', 'are', '80', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'low', 'point', 'quality', 'film', 'realistic', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'one', 'could', 'relate', 'John', 'Hughes', 'been', 'held', 'up', 'sort', 'King', 'Teenage', 'Experience', 'how', 'teenage', 'experience', 'well', 'guy', 'seriously', 'selective', 'memory', 'then']",High School Reunion Collection: (The Breakfast Club / Sixteen Candles / Weird Science)

761881,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B0000A98ZQ,Dorrie Wheeler,"[13, 15]","Okay...when I heard about The Brat Pack Movie and Music Collection I was pretty sure that it was probably just a rehash of The High School Reunion Collection which was released several years ago.  Both sets were released by Universal.  Fear not, I am here to tell you about the differences.  The first thing that is painfully obvious about this set is the choice of movies.  Like it's closest cousin The High School Reunion Collection, The Brat Pack Movie and Music Collection includes the exact same movies-""The Breakfast Club,"" ""Sixteen Candles"" and Weird Science.""  The cover art on the DVD's is the same, no new bonus material with each film that I detected.It has been mentioned time and time again that the choice of movies is a bit off.  No one even really pegged this acting group ""The Brat Pack,"" until around 1985.  Molly Ringwald was one of the best known Brat Pack members and ""Sixteen Candles"" helped to start the whole Brat pack phenom but no one ever considered ""Weird Science"" a Brat Pack movie. Trust me, I remember the 80's.  It always seemed like it would make more sense to include ""St Elmo's Fire"" or ""Pretty in Pink"" in with this set.  This is painfully clear with the bonus music disc included.The music CD includes the following songs-""True"" by Spandau Ballet, ""Tenderness"" by General Public, ""If You Leave"" by OMD, ""Weird Science,"" by Oingo Boingo, ""Oh Yeah"" by Yello (which was in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", Pretty in Pink by the Psychedelic Furs, ""Don't You Forget About Me,"" by Simple Minds and ""I Go Crazy"" by Flesh For Lulu.Why include music from ""Pretty In Pink"" and not include the movie?  On to the packaging.  The packaging is very unique and makes the set worth owning.  I own over 100 TV on DVD and box  sets and nothing is like this.  The DVD's are held in what is literally a three ring binder and the DVD's are in sleeves instead of jewel cases. On the back page of the binder is a pop quiz.For the most part it is very similar to The Highschool Reunion collection but it's nice to have the bonus CD and the cool packaging.  However, it would have been nice if Universal would have given fans who bought the previous set a little more inspiration to purchase this new collection. One must assume they must not own the rights to ""Pretty in Pink"" (it's listed as a Parmount DVD) because that is easily one of the best known Brat Pack movies and it seems insane that it is not included in a set with the term Brat Pack associated with it.",4,Not just a rehash of The High School Reunion Collection,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,2475,"['Okay', 'when', 'heard', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'Movie', 'Music', 'Collection', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'was', 'probably', 'just', 'rehash', 'High', 'School', 'Reunion', 'Collection', 'was', 'released', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'sets', 'were', 'released', 'Universal', 'Fear', 'not', 'am', 'here', 'tell', 'differences', 'first', 'thing', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'set', 'choice', 'movies', 'closest', 'cousin', 'High', 'School', 'Reunion', 'Collection', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'Movie', 'Music', 'Collection', 'exact', 'same', 'movies-', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'Weird', 'Science', 'cover', 'art', 'DVD', 'same', 'new', 'bonus', 'material', 'film', 'detected.It', 'been', 'mentioned', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'choice', 'movies', 'bit', 'off', 'one', 'even', 'really', 'pegged', 'acting', 'group', 'Brat', 'Pack', '1985', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'known', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'members', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'helped', 'start', 'whole', 'Brat', 'pack', 'phenom', 'one', 'ever', 'considered', 'Weird', 'Science', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'movie', 'Trust', 'remember', '80', 'always', 'seemed', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'include', 'St', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'set', 'painfully', 'clear', 'bonus', 'music', 'included.The', 'music', 'CD', 'following', 'songs-', 'True', 'Spandau', 'Ballet', 'Tenderness', 'General', 'Public', 'Leave', 'OMD', 'Weird', 'Science', 'Oingo', 'Boingo', 'Oh', 'Yeah', 'Yello', 'was', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'Psychedelic', 'Furs', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Forget', 'Me', 'Simple', 'Minds', 'Go', 'Crazy', 'Flesh', 'Lulu.Why', 'include', 'music', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'not', 'include', 'movie', 'packaging', 'packaging', 'very', 'unique', 'set', 'worth', 'owning', 'own', 'over', '100', 'TV', 'DVD', 'box', 'sets', 'nothing', 'DVD', 'are', 'held', 'what', 'literally', 'three', 'ring', 'binder', 'DVD', 'are', 'sleeves', 'instead', 'jewel', 'cases', 'back', 'page', 'binder', 'pop', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'similar', 'Highschool', 'Reunion', 'collection', 'nice', 'have', 'bonus', 'CD', 'cool', 'packaging', 'However', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Universal', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'fans', 'who', 'bought', 'previous', 'set', 'little', 'more', 'inspiration', 'purchase', 'new', 'collection', 'One', 'must', 'assume', 'must', 'not', 'own', 'rights', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'listed', 'Parmount', 'DVD', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'known', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'movies', 'insane', 'not', 'included', 'set', 'term', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'associated']",High School Reunion Collection: (The Breakfast Club / Sixteen Candles / Weird Science)

No Brat Pack movie pack is complete without St. Elmo's Fire.(2) WTF is Wargames doing in here? Wargames isn't a Brat Pack movie! Yes, it has Ally Sheedy in it, but Matthew Broderick has never been in any other movies with any Brat Pack members, so he is not a member of the Brat Pack. And starring only one member of the Brat Pack does not make a movie a Brat Pack movie.Basically, this movie has one core BP movie, one peripheral BP movie, and one non-BP movie. It is also worth noting that in addition to not being a Brat Pack movie, Wargames isn't even a GOOD movie, and in addition to being only a peripheral BP movie, Sixteen Candles is pretty mediocre. I have no idea whether they did this on purpose or not. Since this box basically got things about half right overall, I'm giving it 3/5.

761889,AWKOLLCRFFZAM,B0000A98ZQ,"J. Salzenstein ""Style Editor""","[28, 28]","For me, there couldn't be a more fitting name for this set of DVDs. Watching these films was an instant flashback to those years I've so longed to forget. Although I graduated just after The Breakfast ClubSixteen Candles, and Weird Science were released, they were certainly still popular when I was in school, and watching them brought back memories- and reminded me how great these movies are.While these teen angst cult classics will be available individually this fall as well, The High School Flashback Collection brings the three of them together for the first time, which is absolutely brilliant. Whether you host a marathon 80's movie party at your house on a Friday night (and require everyone to wear leg warmers, jelly bracelets, and parachute pants) or simply sit down with a bowl of popcorn one Sunday afternoon, you're going to enjoy three films that helped define a generation.Writer/director John Hughes is brilliant, and these three films are the jewels in his crown. And with stars like Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, Kelly LeBrock, and Emilio Estevez, how can you go wrong?(I'm not even going to get into the synopsis ofThe Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, or Weird Science; if you haven't seen them at least half a dozen times since their release, you shouldn't be reading this, you should be watching the films!)SPECIAL FEATURESFor the most part, the extras on these discs aren't anything to write home about. Having said that, what they lack in quantity, they almost make up for in meatiness.The Breakfast Club includes Sincerely Yours, a 12-part documentary featuring cast and crew (although not surprisingly, Ms. Ringwald is missing...) reflecting on the making of the film, sharing stories, and talking about their lives at the time. It also includes a look at the characters and music from the film, and interviews with filmmakers (Amy Heckerling from Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Diablo Cody from Juno) who talk about the cultural resonance of the film, and how it affecting them and their careers.A second bonus feature- and one I found sociologically interesting- is called The Most Convenient Definitions: The Origins of the Brat Pack. In this featurette, cast members, journalists and film historians explore the ""Brat Pack"" label, and the impact that it had both on pop culture, and on the careers of the group's members. Audio Commentary with Anthon Michael Hall and Judd Nelson, and the original Theatrical Trailer round out the extras.The special features on the Sixteen Candles disc are much weaker. In fact, there's only one, and it's an 11-part documentary featuring cast members who discuss their experience making the film, and what was going on in their lives at the time... is this starting to sound familiar? And yes, there's also an interview with filmmakers- the same from The Breakfast Club- who discuss the cultural resonance of this film, blah, blah, blah.At least the special features on the Weird Science disc original. It's Alive! leads off, with a look at the making of the film, including fashion, music, character development and special effects. Next is She's Alive, the slightly scary (and not in a horror film sort of way) TV pilot episode that was based on the film. Finally, they've thrown in the Theatrical Trailer, most likely just to beef it up.",4,Ya gotta love the 80s!,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,3309,"['could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'fitting', 'name', 'set', 'DVDs', 'Watching', 'films', 'was', 'instant', 'flashback', 'years', ""'ve"", 'so', 'longed', 'forget', 'graduated', 'just', 'Breakfast', 'ClubSixteen', 'Candles', 'Weird', 'Science', 'were', 'released', 'were', 'certainly', 'still', 'popular', 'when', 'was', 'school', 'watching', 'brought', 'back', 'memories-', 'reminded', 'how', 'great', 'movies', 'teen', 'angst', 'cult', 'classics', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'individually', 'fall', 'as', 'well', 'High', 'School', 'Flashback', 'Collection', 'three', 'together', 'first', 'time', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'Whether', 'host', 'marathon', '80', 'movie', 'party', 'house', 'Friday', 'night', 'require', 'everyone', 'wear', 'leg', 'warmers', 'jelly', 'bracelets', 'parachute', 'pants', 'simply', 'sit', 'down', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'one', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', ""'re"", 'going', 'enjoy', 'three', 'films', 'helped', 'define', 'generation.Writer/director', 'John', 'Hughes', 'brilliant', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'jewels', 'crown', 'stars', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'Kelly', 'LeBrock', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'how', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'get', 'synopsis', 'ofThe', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'Weird', 'Science', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'least', 'dozen', 'times', 'release', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'reading', 'should', 'be', 'watching', 'films', 'SPECIAL', 'FEATURESFor', 'most', 'part', 'extras', 'discs', 'are', ""n't"", 'anything', 'write', 'home', 'Having', 'said', 'what', 'lack', 'quantity', 'almost', 'make', 'up', 'meatiness.The', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Sincerely', 'Yours', '12-part', 'documentary', 'featuring', 'cast', 'crew', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'Ms.', 'Ringwald', 'missing', 'reflecting', 'making', 'film', 'sharing', 'stories', 'talking', 'lives', 'time', 'also', 'look', 'characters', 'music', 'film', 'interviews', 'filmmakers', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'Juno', 'who', 'talk', 'cultural', 'resonance', 'film', 'how', 'affecting', 'careers.A', 'second', 'bonus', 'feature-', 'one', 'found', 'sociologically', 'interesting-', 'called', 'Most', 'Convenient', 'Definitions', 'Origins', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'featurette', 'cast', 'members', 'journalists', 'film', 'historians', 'explore', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'label', 'impact', 'had', 'pop', 'culture', 'careers', 'group', 'members', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'Anthon', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'original', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'round', 'extras.The', 'special', 'features', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'disc', 'are', 'much', 'weaker', 'fact', 'only', 'one', '11-part', 'documentary', 'featuring', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'discuss', 'experience', 'making', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'lives', 'time', 'starting', 'sound', 'familiar', 'yes', 'also', 'interview', 'filmmakers-', 'same', 'Breakfast', 'Club-', 'who', 'discuss', 'cultural', 'resonance', 'film', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah.At', 'least', 'special', 'features', 'Weird', 'Science', 'disc', 'original', 'Alive', 'look', 'making', 'film', 'including', 'fashion', 'music', 'character', 'development', 'special', 'effects', 'Next', 'Alive', 'slightly', 'scary', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'sort', 'way', 'TV', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'based', 'film', 'Finally', ""'ve"", 'thrown', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'most', 'likely', 'just', 'beef', 'up']",High School Reunion Collection: (The Breakfast Club / Sixteen Candles / Weird Science)

The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, &amp; Weird Science have just been re-released on DVD in remastered style after very disappointing DVD transfers in the late 90's.The Renunion collection allows purchasers the chance to buy all three DVD's in a package deal.  It makes sense to do this because it is cheaper than buying them separately.  In fact, you practically get one for free!  A friend of mine bought the package as soon as it was released.  I think it will sell out, so hop to it!Each title has been remastered although they are not perfect.  Still, considering the age of these films, they look very pleasing.All three are now 16:9 enhanced which is a blessing, no more large black bars top and bottom which plagued the 1998 DVD of &quot;Breakfast Club&quot; (for example).Even better news for purists, is that the original soundtracks have been reinstated into the films. This is denoted on each separate cover, and is an important factor.  for too long we have had to put up with altered soundtracks. Sixteen Candles soundtrack was butchered so bad that the film lost its spark.  Well no more with this release.The DVD's boast a DTS soundtrack for each movie.  Sorry, but it's nothing to write home about!  In the case of &quot;Breakfast Club&quot;, the opening song &quot;Don't you forget about me&quot; still sounds very lame and mono as it did on the previous DVD release!  The same applies for portions of &quot;sixteen Candles&quot;.  DTS can be a bit of a gimmick as demonstrated by all three DVD's.  Don't be fooled in this regard.Extras? Sorry to report that Universal have decided not to include extras on any on any of the dics (except for trailers).  This is a shame because this is what DVD's are all about.  I can only assume that this is because DTS soundtracks take up considerable disc space.  What I would have liked is some deleted scenes or alternate scenes which do exist. For example, the TV version of &quot;breakfast Club&quot; is different to the DVD version, it contains several different scenes. Overall, there was approximately 4 hours of footage taken from Breakfast Club so to get some of this as an added special feature would have been nice Universal!!!  There are also alternate scenes out there for &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; but you dont get to see them on this DVD.Despite these let-downs, you must order this package deal because it's the best the films have looked in a long time. Plus the original soundtracks have been reinstated.  Another reason is that they will go out of stock for sure.  I've been watching my friends copy, and mine is on the way!!!
