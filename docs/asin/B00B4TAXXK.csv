1621641,AOMDGKZTVIE9P,B00B4TAXXK,Andrew Collins,"[4, 4]","The President of the United States is the head of the executive branch of the U.S. federal government and is also seen as the ""leader"" of the United States. In the long history of the presidency, many different men and personalities have occupied the office.The Ultimate Guide to the Presidents is essentially a remake and update of History's previous presidential presentation from 2005. Like the original, this series sets out to look at every person that has been president. Through quick-paced editing interspersed with interviews from historians, each president is looked at. This includes some of their personality traits and the major events that occurred during their administrations.The series does a decent job of covering the major events without too much detail. After all, even throughout eight forty-five minute episodes, only so much can be explained. The fast pace of the show means that it never gets boring.My two disappointments with the series comes with their coverage of two different eras. The series mostly glosses over a few Gilded Age presidents, such as Rutherford Hayes and Benjamin Harrison, and basically writes them off as ""weak executives."" It would have been nice to see a mention of even the rather minor accomplishments of these men such as civil service reform under Chester Arthur. The other concerns the four most recent presidents. All four are given scant coverage and it almost seems like the modern era was tacked on the end of the last episode as an afterthought. This is particularly ironic when it is considered that their portraits adorn the cover of this DVD set.In conclusion, I found this to be an interesting, if only sometimes incomplete, look at the personalities and accomplishments of the forty-four Presidents of the United States. I would recommend this to those interested in presidents or American history.",4,Personality and Politics,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,1864,"['President', 'United', 'States', 'head', 'executive', 'branch', 'U.S.', 'federal', 'government', 'also', 'seen', 'leader', 'United', 'States', 'long', 'history', 'presidency', 'many', 'different', 'men', 'personalities', 'have', 'occupied', 'office.The', 'Ultimate', 'Guide', 'Presidents', 'essentially', 'remake', 'update', 'History', 'previous', 'presidential', 'presentation', '2005', 'original', 'series', 'out', 'look', 'person', 'been', 'president', 'quick-paced', 'editing', 'interspersed', 'interviews', 'historians', 'president', 'looked', 'personality', 'traits', 'major', 'events', 'occurred', 'administrations.The', 'series', 'decent', 'job', 'covering', 'major', 'events', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'even', 'eight', 'forty-five', 'minute', 'episodes', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'explained', 'fast', 'pace', 'show', 'never', 'boring.My', 'two', 'disappointments', 'series', 'coverage', 'two', 'different', 'eras', 'series', 'mostly', 'few', 'Gilded', 'Age', 'presidents', 'such', 'Rutherford', 'Hayes', 'Benjamin', 'Harrison', 'basically', 'off', 'weak', 'executives', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'mention', 'even', 'rather', 'minor', 'accomplishments', 'men', 'such', 'civil', 'service', 'reform', 'Chester', 'Arthur', 'other', 'concerns', 'four', 'most', 'recent', 'presidents', 'four', 'are', 'given', 'scant', 'coverage', 'almost', 'modern', 'era', 'was', 'tacked', 'end', 'last', 'episode', 'afterthought', 'particularly', 'ironic', 'when', 'considered', 'portraits', 'cover', 'DVD', 'set.In', 'conclusion', 'found', 'be', 'interesting', 'only', 'sometimes', 'incomplete', 'look', 'personalities', 'accomplishments', 'forty-four', 'Presidents', 'United', 'States', 'would', 'recommend', 'interested', 'presidents', 'American', 'history']",The Ultimate Guide To The Presidents

Only issue I have is the end, they rush through almost to the point of skiping, Jimmy carter, Regan, Bush, Clinton, Bush jr and end with Obamas 1st term. All of them get like 2 to 3 mins tops of them just showing photos of them over and over while they talk about a few things they did.

1621643,A6QRO6ALNZ9SS,B00B4TAXXK,Mary,"[49, 53]","When I was asked to review this new DVD series from the History Channel I thought it would be a collection of biographies of the men that have held the office of President of the United States since George Washington assumed the office on April 30, 1789.  Although, it began with George Washington and worked its way through each successive office holder, it quickly became clear to me that the focus of this new 2013 production was directed toward each man's presidential politics and how the policies of each administration ultimately shaped the role of government in its citizens lives and in the world community of nations.Perhaps the best way to illustrate the difference in this new production is to compare it to an earlier award-winning series produced in 2005 for the History Channel entitled simply ""The Presidents"" since they appear to cover the same material.Of course both series start with George Washington.  The 2005 documentary begins by telling us interesting little facts about George Washington, the man.  We learn he loved to dance the minuet and collect American landscape paintings.  He enjoyed interior decoration, personally decorating the interiors of his home at Mount Vernon.  He also dabbled in fashion design and designed various military uniforms.  Thomas Jefferson said he was the best horseman he had ever known and Washington's white horse was named Nelson.We learn Washington was considered a good judge of character and not someone who simply wanted ""yes men"" advisors.  He selected the first cabinet and it was composed of really talented and experienced men including Thomas Jefferson who served as Secretary of State and Alexander Hamilton who became the first Secretary of the Treasury.  Washington met with them regularly and seriously considered their advice when making decisions.  Then, one of the professional historians interviewed for this segment very tactfully mentioned that Washington was ""accustomed to command.""  We also learn that Washington did not like to shake hands but one of the historians again tactfully explained that Washington simply felt it was beneath the dignity of the office of President.The older program went on to tell us that Washington personally selected the site for the new capital and even personally surveyed the site.  Then we learn about Washington's declaration of neutrality when Great Britain went to war with France and, when a large number of citizens violently objected to a whiskey tax enacted by Congress, Washington led a force of 12,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion.  Lastly, much is made of Washington's willingness to lay down the responsibilities of president and peacefully return to Mount Vernon like an American Cinncinattus.Interesting what a difference eight years makes in historical perceptions!  The new series first spends quite a bit of time explaining the context of the office of president at that time.  Congress considers itself the most important governing body and also imparts substantial strength to the judicial branch.  But the position of chief executive is viewed as someone who essentially will rubber stamp whatever legislation is ultimately sanctioned by the Congress.  Members of Congress did not initially consider giving the president veto power or control of government in any way, wishing to avoid the problems of heriditary monarchies or military-controlled empires.As the first person to hold the office, Washington set a number precedents, including the appointment of a cabinet.  As mentioned in the first series, it is pointed out that he dislikes shaking hands but this time the historian is more frank about Washington's attitude that he felt the custom was beneath him.The differences between the two documentaries becomes especially obvious in the discussion of Washington's second term.  When Great Britain and France declare war and Washington decides to sign a neutrality agreement, people are outraged.  Some people call Washington a traitor and Washington is burned in effigy.  Furthermore, Congress questions Washington's right to sign such an agreement since the president cannot declare war.  That is the perogative of Congress.  Washington becomes very angry because he is not only ""accustomed to command"" as it was so delicately stated in the first documentary, but he is not used to criticism or having his viewpoint challenged.As the second term wore on, the 2013 program points out Washington became tired of the job and longed to retire to Mount Vernon.  He often appeared bored at state dinners.His selection of the site of the new nation's capital was not without challenge either.  Several of the colonies, now states, had incurred large debts during the revolution and wanted the central government to now assume them.  Other colonies that had paid their own debts were opposed.  Washington felt strongly that if the central government was to exercise authority over all of the states, it should assume the war debts.  But to overcome the opposition he developed a compromise.  One of the largest debtors was New York, the location of the capital at that time.  The majority of colonies that did not have large war debts was in the south.  So Washington proposed that in exchange for assuming the war debts of the mostly northern colonies, the new government capital would be relocated south to its present location on the Potomac River.  I thought this was an interesting example of early political compromise.So, I came away from my comparison wishing the History Channel had integrated these documentaries to truly produce an ""Ultimate Guide to The Presidents"".  The 2013 documentary also included more live action reenactments and tack sharp visuals as well as a more dramatic score.  At least I can recommend both productions as complementary to each other and not duplicative in scope or focus.",4,More Presidential policies and politics than biography,1365379200,"04 8,

1621644,A19SPM4Y7A8OHN,B00B4TAXXK,MrQ,"[1, 1]","For anyone recently taken over by an interest in our nation, especially the Presidency, this is a good intro. It truly is difficult to find a work that mentions all the United States Presidents without it being a mammoth multi-volume bore (except for that remaining 10% who stay with it).This series gets a big kudos for that. It lays our nation out in chronological order with every President and his major ""hits"" (both the good and the bad) getting enough air time to plant a seed. It is narrated with just the right amount of actual photos, motion pictures, graphics, and current events of those times to make it interesting.The negative? The incessant personal commentaries from current ""historians"" who speak as if they were there with each President, having intimate knowledge of each man's feelings about this or that issue; spewing forth big sweeping generalizations about the American people's mood---why they voted this way or that---overlaying current mores over past eras, world affairs, etc. It does get a bit old and irritating.

Offering unusual stories, this eight-episode History Channel series provides a fresh perspective on the 44 men who have served as Commander-in-Chief, from George Washington to Barack Obama.  It concentrates on the ebbs and flows of presidential power and responsibilities as each of America's leaders deals with the events, expectations, and challenges of his time.One of the most interesting revelations is that the Founding Fathers originally regarded the office of President as administrative, merely to rubber-stamp legislation passed by Congress.  Washington didn't want the job, but when he finally accepted it, he made the office more powerful than envisioned, setting a number of precedents, including appointing a Cabinet.The best aspect of the series is the way the various presidents are personalized.  We get to see how each responded differently to criticism, crises, and public outcry in a job that eventually came to be labeled the most powerful position in the world.Bonus material includes over 30 minutes of footage never before seen on TV.",5,Getting to know America's Chief Executives,1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,1190,"['Ultimate', 'Guide', 'Presidents', 'three-disc', 'DVD', 'collection', 'chronicling', 'American', 'Presidency', 'past', '200', 'years', 'Offering', 'unusual', 'stories', 'eight-episode', 'History', 'Channel', 'series', 'fresh', 'perspective', '44', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'served', 'Commander-in-Chief', 'George', 'Washington', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'ebbs', 'flows', 'presidential', 'power', 'responsibilities', 'America', 'leaders', 'deals', 'events', 'expectations', 'challenges', 'time.One', 'most', 'interesting', 'revelations', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'originally', 'regarded', 'office', 'President', 'administrative', 'merely', 'rubber-stamp', 'legislation', 'passed', 'Congress', 'Washington', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'job', 'when', 'finally', 'accepted', 'made', 'office', 'more', 'powerful', 'envisioned', 'setting', 'number', 'precedents', 'including', 'appointing', 'Cabinet.The', 'best', 'aspect', 'series', 'way', 'various', 'presidents', 'are', 'personalized', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'responded', 'differently', 'criticism', 'crises', 'public', 'outcry', 'job', 'eventually', 'came', 'be', 'labeled', 'most', 'powerful', 'position', 'world.Bonus', 'material', '30', 'minutes', 'footage', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'TV']",The Ultimate Guide To The Presidents
