You would think that was Red country, though it's just a couple hours outside Philly. That contrast is what sets up this film, and it works, sort of. Acting is very good all around.

1430190,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004VW4V76,Grady Harp,"[4, 7]","LEBANON, PA. is a quiet little conversational film that is a microcosm of the interrelationships of families and the issues that affect us all.  It is this straight forward, no pretenses stance that makes the film work.  The story takes place in the town of Lebanon, Pennsylvania and is portrayed as a place where values are traditional and immutable. But after viewing the film, one wonders if the reference to this very church- oriented place might be the biblical one: Jeremiah 22:23 'O inhabitant of Lebanon, nested among the cedars, how you will groan when pangs come upon you, pain as of a woman in travail!'  Just  a passing thought....A death has occurred at film's beginning: Will (Josh Hopkins, another actor to add to the Hunk list) has driven form his advertising firm in Philadelphia for the funeral of his distant father, a teacher and toy boat maker who left his family when Will was young to live in this picturesque but doggedly small town mentality haven.  He stays with his cousin Andy (Ian Merrill Peakes), a devout Catholic whose wife died giving birth to his second child Chase (Hunter Gallagher). His daughter CJ (Rachel Kitson) is the woman of the house despite the fact that she is only seventeen and in high school.  Will attends the sparse funeral of his father: his mother (Mary Beth Hurt) is conspicuously absent, preferring to remain in Philadelphia because of her longterm resentment of he departed husband.  Will finds the slow motion of Lebanon enticing, makes regular visits to the local bar (Christopher Mann plays the observant bartender) where he meets school teacher Vicki (Samantha Mathis), hits on her, falls for her only to discover she is married.CJ has a problem: she is pregnant by classmate Pete (Josh Hunt) but has told no one - until she shares her with Will, a man she feels she can trust.  CJ has dreams of attending college in Philadelphia but her current pregnant status threatens that. She is faced with a major decision: keep the pregnancy and put the child up for adoption or terminate the pregnancy to get on with her life.  Will is supportive as is Vicki with out telling CJ what to do but assuring her she has options.  Andy discovers CJ's secret (as does the entire gossipy town) and on religious grounds demands that she have the baby. How CJ comes to a decision is as tough as the decision Vicki must make about her deep feelings, reciprocated, for Will, and Will must decide whether to follow his father's pathway to isolation form the city or maintain his status quo. The interaction of all these characters results in some tough but realistic decisions about those things we all face in life.Ben Hickernill wrote and directed this film which at times feels like a Hallmark special and at other times like a solid and brave little statement about the cultural divide in America.

1430191,A1A7KZU5NNDP3V,B004VW4V76,"J. Laudermilch ""The snarky critic""","[4, 5]","I'm a native of Lebanon, PA so this movie had a lot to live up to. I was a little put off by the filmmaker's choice to show Lebanon as kind of a country, hick town. We aren't. We are actually a mix of all sorts of people. The older generation probably would see this movie as the way they see Lebanon life. However, not everyone in this town is a religious republican, so I was put off by that. They painted the kids with the same strokes as they painted the parents and I knew that just wasn't correct. I wouldn't be offended seeing a bumper sticker that mentioned pro-choice or going green. I also didn't think Josh Hopkins would stick out like a sore thumb in our town.  Seriously, it's not that tiny. We do have men that look like him. Those things are nit picky because I'm from here, so it did detract from the story for me.That said, as the story unfolded and I got to see where exactly it was  going, I really started to get into the characters.  The two youngest who played siblings were my favorite relationship in the film.  The film did remind me of Juno in that the young girl is faced with similar choices, but I actually found this one to be a lot more mature about it. This girl knew who she was and knew the right questions to ask herself. You hope she makes the right decision, but I realized in watching this, you hope she makes the right decision for her. It wasn't about pro or anti abortion, it was about what a young girl facing a lifelong decision goes through to reach her final choice. They wrote her character in such a way that you know she will make the choice that will be right for her and she will be comfortable with that choice. Isn't that what matters in the end? What is right for me isn't what's necessarily right for someone else. I thought this movie was great in giving that message.The side story with the married teacher could have been fleshed out a bit more. I thought the talents of Samatha Mathis were a bit underused. She was a major part of the story in the end, but her character didn't come off as all that important until the last few scenes.If you liked Juno, I do think you will enjoy this film as it deals in the same issues, but with a greater maturity than Juno. Josh Hopkins was a great lead and I'm hoping the teens will be able to jump start their careers with this movie as both of them were very good.",3,An interesting film,1309651200,"07 3, 2011",2011,2362,"[""'m"", 'native', 'Lebanon', 'PA', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'was', 'little', 'put', 'off', 'filmmaker', 'choice', 'show', 'Lebanon', 'kind', 'country', 'hick', 'town', 'are', ""n't"", 'are', 'actually', 'mix', 'sorts', 'people', 'older', 'generation', 'probably', 'would', 'see', 'movie', 'way', 'see', 'Lebanon', 'life', 'However', 'not', 'everyone', 'town', 'religious', 'republican', 'was', 'put', 'off', 'painted', 'kids', 'same', 'strokes', 'painted', 'parents', 'knew', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'correct', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'offended', 'seeing', 'bumper', 'sticker', 'mentioned', 'pro-choice', 'going', 'green', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Josh', 'Hopkins', 'would', 'stick', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'town', 'Seriously', 'not', 'tiny', 'do', 'have', 'men', 'look', 'things', 'are', 'nit', 'picky', ""'m"", 'here', 'did', 'detract', 'story', 'me.That', 'said', 'story', 'unfolded', 'got', 'see', 'where', 'exactly', 'was', 'going', 'really', 'started', 'get', 'characters', 'two', 'youngest', 'who', 'played', 'siblings', 'were', 'favorite', 'relationship', 'film', 'film', 'did', 'remind', 'Juno', 'young', 'girl', 'faced', 'similar', 'choices', 'actually', 'found', 'one', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'mature', 'girl', 'knew', 'who', 'was', 'knew', 'right', 'questions', 'ask', 'hope', 'right', 'decision', 'realized', 'watching', 'hope', 'right', 'decision', 'was', ""n't"", 'about', 'pro', 'anti', 'abortion', 'was', 'what', 'young', 'girl', 'facing', 'lifelong', 'decision', 'reach', 'final', 'choice', 'wrote', 'character', 'such', 'way', 'know', 'will', 'make', 'choice', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'will', 'be', 'comfortable', 'choice', ""n't"", 'what', 'matters', 'end', 'What', 'right', ""n't"", 'what', 'necessarily', 'right', 'someone', 'else', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'giving', 'message.The', 'side', 'story', 'married', 'teacher', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'bit', 'more', 'thought', 'talents', 'Samatha', 'Mathis', 'were', 'bit', 'underused', 'was', 'major', 'part', 'story', 'end', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'important', 'last', 'few', 'scenes.If', 'liked', 'Juno', 'do', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'same', 'issues', 'greater', 'maturity', 'Juno', 'Josh', 'Hopkins', 'was', 'great', 'lead', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'teens', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'jump', 'start', 'careers', 'movie', 'were', 'very', 'good']","Lebanon, PA"
1430192,A22RZG1NQ0WAUX,B004VW4V76,Katrina L. Burchett,"[2, 2]","Will (Josh Hopkins), an account manager for an ad agency in Philadelphia, attends his father's funeral in Lebanon, PA. While he's back in his hometown seventeen year old CJ (Rachel Kitson) tells him something she's hasn't shared with anyone else - she's pregnant.I'll begin with this: I would have liked the relationship between Will and Vicki (Samantha Mathis) if the circumstances were different.The film clearly shows the problems that arise when a teenage girl gets pregnant, when a teenage boy makes a baby -how it puts a strain on the young parents-to-be and their parents.CJ : It didn't seem to me that this teen was struggling to decide if she should or shouldn't have an abortion. What I saw was a pregnant girl who knew what she wanted to do, but needed someone to tell her the choice was okay.Lebanon, PA deals with the delicate issue of abortion. I thought it was handled quite well, because it wasn't one-sided; however, I didn't like the way Vicki responded to CJ's question. It was like she was telling the girl the decision to make without actually saying the words as if that would free her of any responsibility.There were things I did not agree with, but this was an okay movie. Also, there wasn't much profanity, the shower scene was tastefully done (not much was revealed), and even the act of violence wasn't all that intense. What I liked most was seeing characters praying `in the name of Jesus' - that doesn't happen a whole lot in films.*Do not copy/paste my review without permission.

I did not selected it and watched it only out of social obligation, but I'm glad I did.The bad: It's a bit amateurish. The cinematography in particular was, at times, distracting as it tried just a little too hard. If anything that heavy handedness was the common weakness throughout. Although the acting was good the move was generally a bit over wrought. The pull quote from the trailer was dropped into the film in a way that said after thought more than critical moment, the symbolism of the closing seen was obvious and yet imperfect. The realism was refreshing but the ending took a disappointing turn towards implausible redemption.The inexplicable: I have no idea why it was titled Lebanon, PA. Any conservative rural setting within driving distances of a major metropolitan area would have done. Lebanon wasn't a character, it wasn't relevant. The choice of titles was strange.The good: From opening shot to climax this movie had a refreshing realism, quality acting, and a thought provoking plot. It managed to tell multiple stories in a cohesive and synergistic way. (Drawing those lines together in an improbable resolution was an unfortunate rom-com choice) The realism added to the films wit and engagement.
