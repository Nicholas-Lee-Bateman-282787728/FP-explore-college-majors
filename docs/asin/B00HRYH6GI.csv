But they chose to do things to this new edition that I feel really messed things up.* I purchased this DVD at a local store, and not on Amazon dot com.To begin with, this 35th Edition has a New Narrator whose voice is often timesway too loud, and is also very annoying at times.They should have kept the Original Narrator who was on the Original Release of The Jesus Film. His voice was always at a comfortable volume, and easy to listen to.Plus this 35th Edition has added backround music, that often becomes annoying anddistracting from the visual content.And then there are the Changes in the Words of Jesus that have been made to this new edition of The Jesus Film.In the Original Release of The Jesus Film during the celebration of The Passover, Jesus is talking to His disciples, and one of the things He says, is that if you have no sword to go and sell your cloak and buy one. One of his disciples then picks up two long knives off the ground and says to Jesus that they have two swords, and in this 35th Edition Jesus responds by saying, ""Enough of This."" But in the Original Release of The Jesus Film, Jesus responds by saying, ""That is enough."" There you can clearly see how they changed the words of Jesus from the Original Version of The Jesus Film to the 35th Edition. This makes me think that some PeaceNik who would like to see the American People disarmed was responsible for this change. And, if they made this change regarding the words spoken by the actor playing the part of Jesus in this scene, what other changes might they have made in other scenes?Another problem with the 35th Edition is that the narrator in two different places states that Jesus is the Son of God, in a spiritual sense. ( A spiritual sense? )When Jesus was baptized by his cousin John the Baptist in the Jordan River and the heavens opened and God spoke this is My beloved Son in whom I am well pleased, God did NOT say He is My Son in ( a spiritual sense ) He said this is My Son. This sounds to me like there may have been some type of Islamic influence in this particular changing of the words.I did have high hopes for this 35th Anniversary Edition of The Jesus Film, but I must say that I was very disappointed.*  They should have remastered the visual and audio, turned the full screen into widescreen and left the rest alone. Then I would have written a positive review for this new edition. They had a pretty good movie, and they have really messed it up.Therefore, the next time I watch The Jesus Film, I will be watching my older DVD of the Original Version, while this new 35th Anniversary Edition will remain on the shelf to collect dust.Someone once said, ""If it ain't broken, don't fix it.""I think the people in charge of making this 35th Anniversary Edition should have taken a saying like that to heart.",2,35th Anniversary - Disappointment,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,2966,"['had', 'simply', 'remastered', 'film', 'made', 'widescreen', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'pleased', 'New', '35th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'Jesus', 'Film', 'chose', 'do', 'things', 'new', 'edition', 'feel', 'really', 'messed', 'things', 'up', '*', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'local', 'store', 'not', 'Amazon', 'dot', 'com.To', 'begin', '35th', 'Edition', 'New', 'Narrator', 'voice', 'often', 'timesway', 'too', 'loud', 'also', 'very', 'annoying', 'times.They', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'Original', 'Narrator', 'who', 'was', 'Original', 'Release', 'Jesus', 'Film', 'voice', 'was', 'always', 'comfortable', 'volume', 'easy', 'listen', 'to.Plus', '35th', 'Edition', 'added', 'backround', 'music', 'often', 'annoying', 'anddistracting', 'visual', 'content.And', 'then', 'are', 'Changes', 'Words', 'Jesus', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'new', 'edition', 'Jesus', 'Film.In', 'Original', 'Release', 'Jesus', 'Film', 'celebration', 'Passover', 'Jesus', 'talking', 'disciples', 'one', 'things', 'have', 'sword', 'go', 'sell', 'cloak', 'buy', 'one', 'One', 'disciples', 'then', 'up', 'two', 'long', 'knives', 'ground', 'Jesus', 'have', 'two', 'swords', '35th', 'Edition', 'Jesus', 'saying', 'Enough', 'Original', 'Release', 'Jesus', 'Film', 'Jesus', 'saying', 'enough', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'how', 'changed', 'words', 'Jesus', 'Original', 'Version', 'Jesus', 'Film', '35th', 'Edition', 'think', 'PeaceNik', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'American', 'People', 'disarmed', 'was', 'responsible', 'change', 'made', 'change', 'regarding', 'words', 'spoken', 'actor', 'playing', 'part', 'Jesus', 'scene', 'what', 'other', 'changes', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'other', 'scenes', 'problem', '35th', 'Edition', 'narrator', 'two', 'different', 'places', 'states', 'Jesus', 'Son', 'God', 'spiritual', 'sense', 'spiritual', 'sense', 'When', 'Jesus', 'was', 'baptized', 'cousin', 'John', 'Baptist', 'Jordan', 'River', 'heavens', 'opened', 'God', 'spoke', 'My', 'beloved', 'Son', 'whom', 'am', 'well', 'pleased', 'God', 'did', 'NOT', 'say', 'Son', 'spiritual', 'sense', 'said', 'Son', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'type', 'Islamic', 'influence', 'particular', 'changing', 'words.I', 'did', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', '35th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'Jesus', 'Film', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'should', 'have', 'remastered', 'visual', 'audio', 'turned', 'full', 'screen', 'widescreen', 'left', 'rest', 'alone', 'Then', 'would', 'have', 'written', 'positive', 'review', 'new', 'edition', 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'have', 'really', 'messed', 'up.Therefore', 'next', 'time', 'watch', 'Jesus', 'Film', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'older', 'DVD', 'Original', 'Version', 'new', '35th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'will', 'remain', 'shelf', 'collect', 'dust.Someone', 'once', 'said', 'ai', ""n't"", 'broken', 'do', ""n't"", 'fix', 'think', 'people', 'charge', 'making', '35th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'saying', 'heart']",Jesus Film

I've had a couple copies of the film, and have given several of them away over the years, and watch it periodically.

But I just got mine today and it is fantastic. I don't know how they did it but the Blu-ray is really outstanding High Definition. I haven't had time to compare the Extra Features yet to see if there are new ones, but am very anxious to watch the entire film soon, again.&#34;I love to tell the story... of Jesus and His love&#34;.",5,WoW!
