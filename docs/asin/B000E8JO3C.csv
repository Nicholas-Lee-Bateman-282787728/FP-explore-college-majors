Some of these film interpretations have been wonderful, and others are plain trash.Regarding THIS version (with Michael Caine, Patrick Dempsey, and Mia Sara), the greatest positive I was able to find is that the film does have some action packed moments and makes the veiwer feel sorry for Captain Nemo (and sympathize with his cause).However, the name of the film, a captain called Nemo, a ship-sinking submarine, a professor called Arronax, a harponer named Ned Land, and a lot of angry sentiment about the world above the ocean are basically the only things the novel and this film have in common.In short, if you want a more accurate telling of the novel, purchase the classic Disney version (starring Kirk Douglas & James Mason). However, if you do not mind being surprise with a different rising action and climax, than this 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea could be just the adaptation for you.",3,A Wandering Film,1190937600,"09 28, 2007",2007,970,"['20,000', 'Leagues', 'Sea', 'been', 'adapted', 'many', 'times', 'television', 'film', 'interpretations', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'others', 'are', 'plain', 'trash.Regarding', 'THIS', 'version', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'Mia', 'Sara', 'greatest', 'positive', 'was', 'able', 'find', 'film', 'have', 'action', 'packed', 'moments', 'veiwer', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'sympathize', 'cause', '.However', 'name', 'film', 'captain', 'called', 'Nemo', 'ship-sinking', 'submarine', 'professor', 'called', 'Arronax', 'harponer', 'named', 'Ned', 'Land', 'lot', 'angry', 'sentiment', 'world', 'ocean', 'are', 'basically', 'only', 'things', 'novel', 'film', 'have', 'common.In', 'short', 'want', 'more', 'accurate', 'telling', 'novel', 'purchase', 'classic', 'Disney', 'version', 'starring', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'James', 'Mason', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'mind', 'being', 'surprise', 'different', 'rising', 'action', 'climax', '20,000', 'Leagues', 'Sea', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'adaptation']",N/A
970339,ATGDJOCF60QOU,B000E8JO3C,"ClassicRocker ""ClassicRocker""","[0, 0]","The Kirk Douglass adaption from 1954 will always be my favorite adaption of the classic novel. It had the perfect cast, story line but the one problem with that one was to an extent it followed the novel and changed the novel around the movie with a cold war feeling set back in the 1866. Now i do not have a problem with that there were certain elements i liked changed with the original movie, and made the movie well! But in 1997 it was decided the movie would be remade for television, one for CBS and one for ABC. I didn't like the CBS one with Ben Cross, but it did follow the novel like the original movie to an extent. Like the other two versions this one had more points of the novel in the movie but at the same time it didn't. The movie starts out with Pierre Arronax played by Patrick Dempsey saying he thinks a giant narwal is whats been attacking ships, using the same text from the novel to tell his fathers peers his father mocks him out and he is made a joke. But the cunard line with the US government wants to hunt the beast, and with him, a guy he befriended on the train who was African American, and Ned Land they go to hunt the monster only to find out it isn't a monster. Now this movie has the volcano sequence from the novel, the south pole sequence, Brings up his Indian background, the girl they help, and Atlantis,thou different from the novel a lot of Nemos dialogue from the novel. It does have a lot of stuff written for it. It tries to bring in the issue with slavery, Ned Land is made his character from the novel who wants freedom at whatever the cost, Nemo is brutal to his guests, and he is also part robot. Now however i liked these changes, i also liked how it told the prospective from the US government trying to hunt the beast, i thought these scenes MADE this special. It depends on how much you like the novel or the movie back from the 1950s but either way i liked all three the 1954, the novel and this adaption from 1997. If you want something completely faithful to the novel, theirs the cartoon versions from the 1980s and there was one from nickelodeon from 2002 that was faithful other then having a lead female character in it, like this adaptation.",5,Call me crazy but i liked this adapation.,1396915200,"04 8, 2014",2014,2201,"['Kirk', 'Douglass', 'adaption', '1954', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'favorite', 'adaption', 'classic', 'novel', 'had', 'perfect', 'cast', 'story', 'line', 'one', 'problem', 'one', 'was', 'extent', 'followed', 'novel', 'changed', 'novel', 'movie', 'cold', 'war', 'feeling', 'set', 'back', '1866', 'Now', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'problem', 'were', 'certain', 'elements', 'i', 'liked', 'changed', 'original', 'movie', 'made', 'movie', 'well', '1997', 'was', 'decided', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'remade', 'television', 'one', 'CBS', 'one', 'ABC', 'did', ""n't"", 'CBS', 'one', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'did', 'follow', 'novel', 'original', 'movie', 'extent', 'other', 'two', 'versions', 'one', 'had', 'more', 'points', 'novel', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'out', 'Pierre', 'Arronax', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'saying', 'giant', 'narwal', 'whats', 'been', 'attacking', 'ships', 'using', 'same', 'text', 'novel', 'tell', 'fathers', 'peers', 'father', 'mocks', 'out', 'made', 'joke', 'cunard', 'line', 'US', 'government', 'hunt', 'beast', 'guy', 'befriended', 'train', 'who', 'was', 'African', 'American', 'Ned', 'Land', 'go', 'hunt', 'monster', 'only', 'find', 'out', ""n't"", 'monster', 'Now', 'movie', 'volcano', 'sequence', 'novel', 'south', 'pole', 'sequence', 'up', 'Indian', 'background', 'girl', 'help', 'Atlantis', 'thou', 'different', 'novel', 'lot', 'Nemos', 'dialogue', 'novel', 'have', 'lot', 'stuff', 'written', 'bring', 'issue', 'slavery', 'Ned', 'Land', 'made', 'character', 'novel', 'who', 'freedom', 'whatever', 'cost', 'Nemo', 'brutal', 'guests', 'also', 'part', 'robot', 'Now', 'however', 'i', 'liked', 'changes', 'i', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'told', 'prospective', 'US', 'government', 'trying', 'hunt', 'beast', 'i', 'thought', 'scenes', 'MADE', 'special', 'how', 'much', 'novel', 'movie', 'back', '1950s', 'way', 'i', 'liked', 'three', '1954', 'novel', 'adaption', '1997', 'want', 'something', 'completely', 'faithful', 'novel', 'cartoon', 'versions', '1980s', 'was', 'one', 'nickelodeon', '2002', 'was', 'faithful', 'other', 'then', 'having', 'lead', 'female', 'character', 'adaptation']",N/A

970341,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000E8JO3C,Grady Harp,"[27, 29]","Few knew when Jules Verne was writing his futuristic novels in the 19th century that such entertaining page-turners would foretell so much reality.  In this 1997 adaptation of Verne's '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea' the screenwriter (Brian Nelson) and director Rod Hardy have elected to pay homage to the scientific aspects of the thriller rather than make the story into a cartoon.  And though it is a long song (3 hours), it plays well and introduces some fine special effects and philosophical statements about environmental issues, slavery, feminism, familial relationships, and commitment to dreams.  Not bad for a Sci-Fi novel!The cast is solid: Patrick Dempsey makes a wholesome, handsome Pierre Arronax, Bryan Brown as the driven sailor Ned Land, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is excellent as Cabe Attucks (nice to see this fine actor in a role far different than the one he played on the TV series 'Oz'), John Bach is the arrogant father Thierry Arronax, and  Mia Sara serves up the beefed up role of Mara nicely.  But the submarine mysterious ship Nautilus surfaces or sinks at the hands of Captain Nemo and while Michael Caine isn't the embodiment of evil we so often see, he finds the soul of the driven scientist whose goal is to protect the 'surface' he has forsaken to scuttle the seas in search of ways to stop future earthquakes topside.Originally made as a mini-series for television in 1997, the movie for sails along, holding our attention and fascination for the full three hours, not only because we care about the characters, but also because we are treated to some spectacular underwater sequences and a Nautilus that is as elegant a vessel as Verne described.  And yes, Captain Nemo still plays the pipe organ as part of the musical score.  The script gets a bit on the corny side, especially in the areas of father son relationships, and the unnecessary spin on romances that seem to be de rigueur in keeping an audiences attention. But in the end this is an entertaining interpretation of the Jules Verne classic that still stimulates our thinking and challenges our concepts of environmental concerns.

I had only seen the Disney movie before, but not since I was a little kid so I didn't really remember it. The book ended up being really different, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying this movie. The Stanley Kubrick version of The Shining doesn't have much to do with the book it's based on either, but I still love it. If you can watch this version of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea as it's own thing, it's actually really good. I actually always thought it was one of the best made-for-tv movies, and I wanted to see it again but they never reaired it. Finally it came out on DVD after YEARS of searching for it, and I still like it.I don't understand all the negative reviews. I'm probably going to get attacked for this, but I actually like this better than the Disney movie, which I watched again not long after this aired. The Disney movie feels to me like a travelogue and has minimal story. This version has a better story and a more climactic ending. There's more happening. It's darker, edgier. There's more character development, and a couple new characters (Nemo's daughter, played by Mia Sara), which may make some people mad but I thought it added to the story. One of the criticisms I've heard people make of Jules Verne is that he wasn't very good at writing women. All the same themes and ideas are here, some of them are just presented in a different way. The special effects aren't as good as I remembered, they look kind of cheap, but halfway through the movie you stop noticing because you're drawn into the story.Anyway, give it a chance.
