484292,A1K3WK2QHB8397,6305949778,A Customer,"[5, 5]","I am so tired of the current trend of taking good films from Hong Kong and Americanizing them.  The Defender is a perfect example.  The original title  was The Bodyguard From Beijing and it was subtitled as all good HK films  should be.  The film is based on the American film The Bodyguard with Jet  Li protraying the role of Kevin Costner and charged with protecting the  female lead.  Jet Li plays a Chinese military officer, and the HK Police in  the film never miss a chance to poke fun at Red China - something that the  newer HK films are forbidden to do.  Anyway, Jet Li acts in his typical  style, getting into fights and all.  There's a great fight at the end of  the film in a kitchen filled with a noxious gas.  Jet Li and the other guy  go from beating on each other to trying to get some fresh air - great HK  action!  There's another scene set in a mall featuring Jet Li vs. everyone!

484294,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,6305949778,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[0, 0]","The Defender is perhaps one of Jet Li's more different and original of all his HK made films.  The movie relies on a pretty good story filled with multiple aspects of conflict and suspense, rather than a lot of action.  The lesser amount of action never phased me because I thought the movie does well without it.  Thats not to say there isn't any, just not as much as most of Jet Li's movies.  Fortunately, if you can't help but desire a good fight, the finale of the movie presents one of Jet Li's better fights scenes I have ever scene, a fight of originailty etched with emotion.There are a few set backs from getting a 5 star rating.  The English dubbing, as always, gives the movie a cheesy feel sometimes and makes the acting seem a little week.  Aside from the dubbing, there are some moments in the movie that are a bit cheesy.  Jet Li's character and the woman he is ordered to protect endure continuous scenes of tension that are great to watch, since he takes his work seriously and she has a rich boyfriend who has hired the bodyguard.  Though entertaining and suspenseful moments arise from these two, they also present the cheesy moments, especially the ending of the film.The Defender is a great addition to anyone who loves Jet Li movies.  I'd have to say this is one of his better ones overall.  Great story filled with suspense, and a wonderful final fight scene that is amongst the best.  If you are looking for movie filled with action throughout, it may not please, but this is a good all-around film, giving more than most martial art films would.",4,"fantastic jet li movie, though a bit cheesy",1163808000,"11 18, 2006",2006,1570,"['Defender', 'perhaps', 'one', 'Jet', 'Li', 'more', 'different', 'original', 'HK', 'made', 'films', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'filled', 'multiple', 'aspects', 'conflict', 'suspense', 'rather', 'lot', 'action', 'lesser', 'amount', 'action', 'never', 'phased', 'thought', 'movie', 'well', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'just', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'most', 'Jet', 'Li', 'movies', 'Fortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'desire', 'good', 'fight', 'finale', 'movie', 'one', 'Jet', 'Li', 'better', 'fights', 'scenes', 'have', 'ever', 'scene', 'fight', 'originailty', 'etched', 'are', 'few', 'set', 'backs', 'getting', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'English', 'dubbing', 'always', 'movie', 'cheesy', 'feel', 'sometimes', 'acting', 'seem', 'little', 'week', 'Aside', 'dubbing', 'are', 'moments', 'movie', 'are', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'Jet', 'Li', 'character', 'woman', 'ordered', 'protect', 'endure', 'continuous', 'scenes', 'tension', 'are', 'great', 'watch', 'work', 'seriously', 'rich', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'hired', 'bodyguard', 'entertaining', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'arise', 'two', 'also', 'present', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'especially', 'ending', 'film.The', 'Defender', 'great', 'addition', 'anyone', 'who', 'Jet', 'Li', 'movies', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'overall', 'Great', 'story', 'filled', 'suspense', 'wonderful', 'final', 'fight', 'scene', 'best', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'filled', 'action', 'may', 'not', 'please', 'good', 'all-around', 'film', 'giving', 'more', 'most', 'martial', 'art', 'films', 'would']",The Defender VHS

She is the only remaining witness to a mob hit.At first the girl is a pampered, spoiled, gold digging jerk, who doesn't listen to her new bodyguard's security restrictions, 'cause they put a kink in her shopping time!When she is nearly killed in a attempt on her life at the mall (after not listening to the bodyguard's security concerns about a large open area like a mall)... she begins to realize perhaps she should listen to the bodyguard!THE BODYGUARD FROM BEJING is the original name for this film. Like most HK films, it is very well made, but when Americans get their hands on them, they edit them, often taking out whole scenes, and don't make any attempt at good dubbing, as that costs more money. This makes the films look funny when it shouldn't be, and poorly made, when they aren't.This is the only version available right now.

484298,AL1P9JG9K9B6J,6305949778,Horst H,"[0, 0]","I rarely believe what other reviewers say and I am glad I didn't do it this time either. The DVD I got was issued by Dimension on August 15, 2000 and the quality of the film is excellent. The synchronization (into English) is also excellent, as are the (English) subtitles.There are two problems however:The first one concerns the translation from Cantonese into English. By pure chance I had also bought ""Jet Li: Film Collection"" and one of the 8 films in this collection turned out to be ""The Bodyguard from Beijing"", in other words ""The Defender"". It is in Cantonese and its English subtitles are often VERY different from those in ""The Defender"". As I unfortunately do not understand Cantonese I can not say which translation is the correct one. I must admit that I do not know if this version of ""The Bodyguard from Beijing"" is the same that is being offered as a standalone version which may be different. Nevertheless this remarkable difference in translation is worrisome.The second problem is a medical one and also occurs in other HK movies repeatedly. When in the ""The Defender"" towards the end the room fills with gas Jet Li and Collin Chou/Ngai Sing try to save themselves by slashing water in their mouths....!This is such absolute nonsense it equals Jackie Chan's car battery resuscitation in RobinBHood! Every movie producer should have a medical consultant for each movie so that such absolute stupidities will not occur.Final comment: Although my version of ""The Bodyguard from Beijing"" is two minutes longer than ""The Defender"", there are still cuts noticeable.",5,The Defender,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,1580,"['rarely', 'believe', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'say', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'time', 'DVD', 'got', 'was', 'issued', 'Dimension', 'August', '15', '2000', 'quality', 'film', 'excellent', 'synchronization', 'English', 'also', 'excellent', 'are', 'English', 'are', 'two', 'problems', 'however', 'first', 'one', 'translation', 'Cantonese', 'English', 'pure', 'chance', 'had', 'also', 'bought', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Film', 'Collection', 'one', '8', 'films', 'collection', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Bodyguard', 'Beijing', 'other', 'words', 'Defender', 'Cantonese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'often', 'VERY', 'different', 'Defender', 'unfortunately', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'Cantonese', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'translation', 'correct', 'one', 'must', 'admit', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'version', 'Bodyguard', 'Beijing', 'same', 'being', 'offered', 'standalone', 'version', 'may', 'be', 'different', 'Nevertheless', 'remarkable', 'difference', 'translation', 'worrisome.The', 'second', 'problem', 'medical', 'one', 'also', 'other', 'HK', 'movies', 'repeatedly', 'When', 'Defender', 'end', 'room', 'gas', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Collin', 'Chou/Ngai', 'Sing', 'try', 'save', 'slashing', 'water', 'mouths', 'such', 'absolute', 'nonsense', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'car', 'battery', 'resuscitation', 'RobinBHood', 'Every', 'movie', 'producer', 'should', 'have', 'medical', 'consultant', 'movie', 'so', 'such', 'absolute', 'stupidities', 'will', 'not', 'occur.Final', 'comment', 'version', 'Bodyguard', 'Beijing', 'two', 'minutes', 'longer', 'Defender', 'are', 'still', 'cuts', 'noticeable']",The Defender VHS

484300,A15TIGL6MKUWYU,6305949778,"Mark E. Summers ""Gamekrazy""","[2, 3]","I like Jet Li, but I didn't particularly care for this movie.  First off, this is the most wooden I've ever seen Jet Li acting.  Granted, his character was supposed to be one of those stone faced types who doesn't let his emotions show until he starts falling in love with the woman he's protecting.  Unfortunately, even after he's supposed to be falling in love with her, he looks no less wooden.  It's as if he were doing this movie against his better judgement, and just couldn't get into the role he was supposed to play.  At least that's the way it seemed to me.The plot line is fairly standard, a woman, along with two other witnesses, sees one man kill another, and then weeks before his trial, the other two witnesses are killed, and she narrowly avoids being killed herself, so her boyfriend hires a bodyguard to protect her.  Enter Jet Li's character, who annoys the woman he's supposed to be protecting by violating her privacy, installing security cameras all over her house, including her bedroom.  He annoys her, that is, until she stupidly goes out shopping against his recommendation, and he has to save her life from what looked like about twenty assassins who try to kill her at the mall.  The action sequence here, and the big fight at the end, are the main reasons I gave this movie even as good a recommendation as I did.  The rest of it is very subpar, but the action sequences are exciting, intense, and fast paced.Some of the side characters in this movie went beyond my annoyance tolerance level.  One of the cops only purpose was to serve as some sort of comedy relief, but unfortunately, he wasn't very funny, and didn't demonstrate any great effort on the side of the police to protect their only remaining witness to thii crime.  Also, the girls little brother is given a fair amount of air time in the movie, and he was annoying beyond belief, and I saw absolutely no reason for him ever to have been included as a character in this movie except to cause trouble, and draw the movie out a little longer.In closing, if you want to see some great action sequences, and don't mind a lot of ho hum filler scenes in between, go ahead and rent this movie, but don't buy it, it's definitely not worth that.  If you do rent it, I recommend just skipping to about half way into the movie when the crew goes shopping, and then to the end for the final fight.
