I regret that I had to get a VHS copy as that was the only type available and hope it will come to DVD soon.  This was an unusual story about a drifter who comes to town to find his mother and meets a lady that is a bored housewife with an unusual past.  I thought that considering the story and the character, Teresa Russell did a good job in her role.  Gary Oldman who is my favorite actor was excellent as Martin the drifter.  A lot of times he was over the top but not enough for the movie to not be enjoyable.  It was easy to see how he became the actor that we know of today.  This movie doesn't follow the standard Hollywood type of movie and plays more as an indendent film.  It is not for everyone but is very entertaining and a must see for any Gary Oldman fan.",5,Unusual but entertaining story,1260576000,"12 12, 2009",2009,822,"['was', 'glad', 'have', 'chance', 'view', 'movie', 'regret', 'had', 'get', 'VHS', 'copy', 'was', 'only', 'type', 'available', 'hope', 'will', 'come', 'DVD', 'soon', 'was', 'unusual', 'story', 'drifter', 'who', 'town', 'find', 'mother', 'lady', 'bored', 'housewife', 'unusual', 'past', 'thought', 'considering', 'story', 'character', 'Teresa', 'Russell', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'who', 'favorite', 'actor', 'was', 'excellent', 'Martin', 'drifter', 'lot', 'times', 'was', 'top', 'not', 'enough', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'became', 'actor', 'know', 'today', 'movie', ""n't"", 'follow', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'type', 'movie', 'more', 'indendent', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'very', 'entertaining', 'must', 'see', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'fan']",Track 29 VHS

I picked it up because I saw that Gary Oldman was in it, but I couldn't make heads or tails of the characters or plot. Apparantly, there's an unhappily married  woman (Theresa Russell) who keeps fantasizing that the son she gave up for  adoption has come looking for her.  He appears in the form of Oldman, but  he acts like a bratty three year old, and the sequences involving him and  Russell are just too odd to explain.  And then there's her husband  (Christopher Lloyd), who has this weird fascination with trains and  masochism...but that's a different story.  The ending makes no sense, but  then, the whole movie makes no sense so I guess it doesn't matter.",2,Too weird for words,944697600,"12 9, 1999",1999,718,"['have', 'only', 'been', 'able', 'sit', 'film', 'once', 'picked', 'up', 'saw', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'was', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'heads', 'tails', 'characters', 'plot', 'Apparantly', 'unhappily', 'married', 'woman', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'who', 'fantasizing', 'son', 'gave', 'up', 'adoption', 'come', 'looking', 'form', 'Oldman', 'bratty', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'sequences', 'involving', 'Russell', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'odd', 'explain', 'then', 'husband', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'who', 'weird', 'fascination', 'trains', 'masochism', 'different', 'story', 'ending', 'sense', 'then', 'whole', 'movie', 'sense', 'so', 'guess', ""n't"", 'matter']",Track 29 VHS

Oldman plays a character that may or may not exist in reality but is almost a demonic force in the mad mind of Theresa Russell.  This twisted, frustrating and weirdly mesmerizing story about a woman caught in a sexless. Cold marriage to a preoccupied, miniature train-loving doctor (Christopher Lloyd) who fantasizes about the son she gave away after being raped as a teen.  Or is Oldman's drifter a monster who takes advantage of a crazy, vulnerable woman?  Or is he the seducer of his own mother?  No matter what the reality, it's hard to take your eyes off Oldman in one of his more galvanizing early roles that has been compared to his work in SID AND NANCY.  Some critics hated this picture as hopelessly ambiguous, but that's the whole point of it all.
