HE HAS  A FULL BAND, AND BACKUP VOCALISTS, AS  COMPARED TO JUST HIM, A BASS & DRUMMER, IN LIVE  IN SAN FRAN. STAY AWAY FROM THAT ONE IT STINKS. LIAR IS ALSO VERY GOOD IF YOU LIKE THE  LIAR CD YOU WILL LIKE THE LIAR DVD. BUT AS A VERY LONG TIME TODD FAN SINCE HE BEGAN WITH NAZZ, THIS IS REALLY VERY GOOD.  HIS BAND IS GREAT, HIS VOICE IS AT ITS BEST.  HE PLAYS VERY LITTLE GUITAR ON THIS DVD, AND LIAR. BUT THE GUITAR PLAYER IS EXCELLENT.  LIVE IN JAPAN IS WELL WORTH THE  MONEY.",5,TODD AT  HIS  BEST,1166832000,"12 23, 2006",2006,569,"['VERY', 'GOOD', 'AUDIO-VIDEO', 'GREAT', 'SONG', 'SELECTION', 'TODD', 'AT', 'HIS', 'BEST', 'IN', 'THIS', 'OLDER', 'VIDEO', 'HE', 'A', 'FULL', 'BAND', 'AND', 'BACKUP', 'VOCALISTS', 'AS', 'COMPARED', 'TO', 'JUST', 'HIM', 'A', 'BASS', 'DRUMMER', 'IN', 'LIVE', 'IN', 'SAN', 'FRAN', 'STAY', 'AWAY', 'ONE', 'IT', 'STINKS', 'LIAR', 'IS', 'ALSO', 'VERY', 'GOOD', 'IF', 'YOU', 'LIKE', 'THE', 'LIAR', 'CD', 'YOU', 'WILL', 'LIKE', 'THE', 'LIAR', 'DVD', 'BUT', 'A', 'VERY', 'LONG', 'TIME', 'TODD', 'FAN', 'SINCE', 'HE', 'BEGAN', 'WITH', 'NAZZ', 'THIS', 'REALLY', 'VERY', 'GOOD', 'HIS', 'BAND', 'IS', 'GREAT', 'HIS', 'VOICE', 'IS', 'AT', 'ITS', 'BEST', 'HE', 'PLAYS', 'VERY', 'LITTLE', 'GUITAR', 'ON', 'THIS', 'DVD', 'AND', 'LIAR', 'BUT', 'THE', 'GUITAR', 'PLAYER', 'IS', 'EXCELLENT', 'LIVE', 'IN', 'JAPAN', 'IS', 'WELL', 'THE', 'MONEY']",N/A

The greater number of personnel allows for more diverse arrangements, and no edge has been sacrificed.  The songs drive hard, and include a number of other standards such as &quot;Love of the Common Man&quot;, &quot;Real Man,&quot; and &quot;Love In Action.&quot;  It's also -funny- here and there...What may also surprise you is the lighting -- there is greater variation in the lighting than I've seen in the Utopia DVD's currently available.With this old show finally available on DVD, can &quot;An Evening With Utopia&quot; be far behind?",5,"Solid, professional performance, great song selection",1030924800,"09 2, 2002",2002,817,"['.This', '1990', 'concert', 'was', 'part', 'tour', 'promote', 'quot', 'Nearly', 'Human', 'quot', 'thus', 'highlights', 'songs', 'one', 'Todd', 'most', 'melodic', 'interesting', 'albums', 'solid', 'non-Utopian', 'band', 'additional', 'guitarist', 'keyboards', 'bass', 'drums', 'sax', 'trumpet', 'backing', 'vocalists', 'greater', 'number', 'personnel', 'allows', 'more', 'diverse', 'arrangements', 'edge', 'been', 'sacrificed', 'songs', 'drive', 'hard', 'include', 'number', 'other', 'standards', 'such', 'quot', 'Love', 'Common', 'Man', 'quot', 'quot', 'Real', 'Man', 'quot', 'quot', 'Love', 'Action.', 'quot', 'also', '-funny-', 'here', 'there', 'What', 'may', 'also', 'surprise', 'lighting', 'greater', 'variation', 'lighting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Utopia', 'DVD', 'currently', 'old', 'show', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'can', 'quot', 'Evening', 'Utopia', 'quot', 'be', 'far']",N/A

Nearly 20 songs in just over 90 minutes, and worth every minute.  His band features former members of The Tubes and Bourgeois Tagg, bands for whom Todd has served as producer over the years.  The normally staid Japanese audience goes wild for Todd at this show, and so will you.  I can't believe this concert was never released on CD -- it is THAT GOOD!  I found this video in a cut-out bin at Camelot Music in 1992 and I only had to pay $7.00 for it.

271964,A339IE87G18AJ1,6301902122,WillieB,"[6, 6]","Todd is a master crafter of catchy songs, an innovative musician/engineer, and his unmistakable voice (full, thick and soothing) is a treat to hear. On this DVD, most of the songs from ""Nearly Human"" and other favorites are captured live. The band consists of guitar, bass, drums, two keyboardists, sax, trumpet, percussion, three female backing vocals and Todd. If you want to see Todd jam you may be disappointed since he only plays lead on ""Unloved Children"", solo acoustic guitar on ""Love of the Common Man"", and electric guitar on ""Love in Action"". On this tour, he focused on singing and let his incredibly tight band provide the music.The video is clear; the editing, tastefully done, shows the enthusiasm of the musicians. Audio choices are DD 5.1 and stereo. Both sound great, but the stereo mix sounds tighter and better defined.
