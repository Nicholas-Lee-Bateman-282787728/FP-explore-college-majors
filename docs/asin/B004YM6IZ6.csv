It was still very good, just not like it has been in the past.  The only real standout in this season was Gabrielle Anwar's Fiona.  You were able to see new depth to her character that you hadn't before.  In past seasons she was always willing to do whatever it took to help their clients, but the show never explored her as a person.  This season we were better able to see what she was willing to sacrifice for the greater good of those whe loved, even if it was her freedom.  This was a big turnaround for someone who I always thought was a little selfish and narrow minded.  Like I said she was always willing to do whatever it takes, but usually in her own terms.  She relentlessly pursued her relationship with Michael, but she would always threaten to walk away if he did something she didn't like.  While the changes in Fiona were good, I did not always like the changes in Michael.  Too many times this season, he went too far, and sometimes it looked like the othere could never pull him back.  I think the she runners were trying to show us what he was like pre burn notice now that he was back with the CIA, but I still did not like the changes.  These things I could have forgiven and still given the season 4 stars, but the worst part was the shows under utilization of Bruce Campbell.  I felt that Sam spent most of the season in background.  I think that he is one of the best parts of the show, and I hate that he was only used for occasional comic relief.

But he's great in a supporting role if used sparingly.) The trio is great and you don't want to screw up a good thing. I got the feeling they thought Season 4 was it and this is a bit of surprise, but I don't follow the biz closely enough to really know.  At any rate, very glad to see this excellent series continue (now that Season 6 is a done deal).It's a challenge to keep a series going for more than a few seasons -- coming up with new ideas and interesting plots...where to take it all?  So they have to go somewhere new and a bit darker makes sense to me.  But I hope they don't lose the campy humor that's at the heart of this and keeps it fun.However it goes, you have to say these guys put together one of the best new action series in a long time.  Kudos to whoever green lighted this one.  The experience of all involved really makes it work.  These guys know what they are doing and they never forget their mission - to entertain!

In an attempt to stick with the formula of essentially wrapping up each episode, the scripts started to get too fantastical and farfetched.  The other thing that was troubling this season was that we start to see a dark side to Michael, nothing wrong with that.  However, there didn't seem to be much moral weight to it.  He does some pretty awful things and the show glossed over some of this.  I think it would have been better of these things created more dialog amongst his friends, I think Sam and Jesse would have called Michael out and pushed back more on some things.As to my comment about the episode formula, I am happy to say they really changed things up for the next season.  There is even some mention about Michael having sort of gone off the rails.  I certainly think that Season 5 is worth buying.

1433395,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B004YM6IZ6,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[45, 49]","This latest season of BURN NOTICE, one of the best TV shows on the air right now, was decidedly different in tone if not in execution as Michael Westen, Fiona Glennanne, Sam Axe and Jesse Porter face a much more insidious threat than they have before on this show, and this show has seen plenty of threats.We begin with Michael being embraced once again by the CIA, under the purview of his old handler Raines (the always great, but sadly under-used Dylan Baker) and while he's in a probationary period, he's putting all of his old skills to work with his new partner Max (Grant Snow) and has a new case officer, the sharp and attractive Agent Pearce (Lauren Stamile). He's living in something resembling bliss also, with Fiona moved into his loft, desperately trying to make the place more hospitable. Sam is back down to his ""fighting weight"", as we saw in the tie-in TV movie THE FALL OF SAM AXE, and Jesse has a flashy job with an independent, high-profile security contractor. Madeline is also dating!The first few episodes of the season deal mostly with Michael sliding comfortably back into working as a spy again, bantering with his pals, becoming somewhat domesticated by Fi, and outwitting the bad guys. Things turn for the worse with a shocking death that Michael is intended to be framed for, and our heroes scramble to track down the real killer, while keeping the intrepid Agent Pearce off their backs. This leads once again to another showdown with Dead Larry (the sleazy and great Tim Matheson in his recurring guest role) who is forcing Michael again to do something dangerous and traitorious (like stealing secrets from a foreign embassy), as they race to save the life of an innocent woman who is engaged to a psychiatrist named Anson (the GREAT Jere Burns) who has been kidnapped by Larry. As we find out shortly, Anson's fiance is already dead and when Fi tries to save Michael using small amounts of explosives (and as an ancillary bonus, get Larry out of their lives forever), the detonation seems to cause greater damage than anticipated and kills the small unit of innocent security guards in the building. Fi is utterly shocked and haunted by this; especially since she's never wrong about the explosives she uses. As guilt begins to bear down on Fi and the rest of the team, it is revealed that Anson is actually the man behind all of this. Anson is the LAST one of the group that burned Michael; he was the one who had Michael framed for a fellow agent's death, and he set charges in the embassy killing those guards to frame Fi, and unless Michael uses his regained CIA security to help Anson achieve his goals, he will release the evidence that will link Fi to the deadly explosion. The questions then become: How far will Anson make Michael go, and how can Michael defeat him when he proves time and again that he holds all the cards? Also, can Fiona live with Michael doing these things to protect her?As you can probably tell from that summation, this is a considerably darker tone than any previous season has taken. While Michael may deal with psychopaths and international assassins and shadowy cabals on a weekly basis, never has a threat emerged in a more frightening and more immediate fashion as Anson. Being a psychiatrist, Anson is able to probe deeply into Michael's mind, shaking his faith in himself, and is also able to predict Michael's moves before he does them. That element of prediction is brought into shocking relief when it comes out that Madeline's boyfriend has been spying on Michael at Anson's behest. Even more shocking than that are certain truths about Michael's father.While the primary cast members continue to work extremely well together, the biggest coup of the season is Jere Burns as Anson. He plays this part to perfection, and what's fun about him is his willingness to be in physical danger when he confronts Michael. Burns is not in any way a physically intimidating actor and he uses that as a strength during his scenes with Michael and the gang. Anson isn't afraid of Michael because Michael knows that the danger that Anson can put the people he cares about in.As far as our primary players, Jesse is more or less persona non grata in this season, which is actually something I consider to be something of an asset. It's nothing against the character or against Coby Bell as an actor; I just don't find Jesse to be a truly necessary part of the team that showrunner Matt Nix has crafted over these five seasons to be three of the most unique and consistently entertaining characters on television. Jesse seemed to be shoe-horned in when he was introduced as kind of a sequel to Michael Westen, and his absences during this season certainly were not glaring. In the episodes he's in during this season, he plays usually a small but integral role, and that's how it should stay. Jeffrey Donovan gets to play things not quite so close to the vest this season and he really pulls off a difficult job of having to be less of the gang's stoic anchor and man of action, and it gives way to frustration, paranoia and fear. Gabrielle Anwar is still incredibly appealing and flirty and sexy (although I do think she should have a burger every now and then) and she's also dangerous as ever, but her more constant interaction with Michael does start to show and gives her character more dimensions to play at. BRUCE CAMPBELL IS SAM AXE. That's all you need to know about him. He's possibly the one person you would want backing you up for all of eternity. And most importantly, I think it's a sin that Sharon Gless hasn't been nominated for awards for every single season. Her performance and her character are the emotional core of this show, and if that goes, the whole show becomes something less, and the great thing that Nix is doing is giving Madeline more to do, which means Gless has more screen-time and we have more time to bask in the greatness of her character and her performance.For all of the seasons of this show, I always felt that if the show got too dark, it would start to lose much of what makes the show such a breezy and effortlessly entertaining hour. This season of the show shows it at its darkest yet, and it does go to places that you wouldn't have expected it to go, but with the show's major arc (Who burned Michael and why?) inevitably coming to a close, things do get darkest before the dawn. I still think this show has a few seasons left in it, and I'm sure that Matt Nix will keep things moving and maybe allow our heroes to have things be a little easier. This season, however; they have it harder than ever before, and considering the events of the season finale, it might get harder and darker still.",5,"A darker direction for Westen and Co., but it

In other words he was terminated, without access to cash, contacts or influence.He finds himself in his hometown Miami, Fla. He turns to his old girlfriend Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar), a retired Navy SEAL Sam Axe (Bruce Campbell) and Madeline Westen (Sharon Gless) his mother, to try to find who burned him and why.

His character of Michael Westen is downright awesome and amazing!  Hats still off to Sam as he spends most seasons in the background but he is a funny and loveable character.This season shows a darker side to Michael, more geared towards his CIA days and reconnecting with ""old friends"".  But with the show's major arc (Who burned Michael and why?) inevitably coming to a close, things do get darkest before the dawn.  Fiona's character also grew immensly in this season, she is always kick butt and edgy, she shows female strongness and empowerment- she holds her own and I think it's amazing they finally made a character on TV that isn't ditzy- someone who's intelligent and knows how to get the job done, and handle the big artillery.  Jesse grew a lot on me this season- before I didn't care much for him as a ""burned agent"" or his character, but he really stepped it up this season and I grew as a fan of his.

I watched seasons 1-4 in preperation for season 5, and was immediately struck by jerky, badly cut filming during scenes, stiff character postures, terrible dialogue and a wooden serious atmosphere. I felt like characters had turned into charicatures of themselves, trying too hard, acting over the top, ect. Example: Fiona had turned into a girly girl more concerned with her hair, clothes and vacation spot than anything worth while. She's always been a fashion minded, at times femanine woman, and I find no fault with that, because she always had an edge and a strong attitude, a strong person.Scenes were rushes, clipped and jumped from face shot to face shot on who ever was talking. I didn't see any of the nuances that I had come to enjoy with Burn notice, the facial expressions and subtle tones of voice that conveyed more than words alone could. I went online to see if I could figure out what, if anything has changed, but in the end it doesn't really matter I suppose. Overall, I am very disappointed in Season 5 so far.Okay, so the season has gotten a little better as it has gone on, or maybe I've gotten used to the ""different"" prsentation. I'm feeling a little more invested in the plot and I'm feeling more interested in the characters.

It was becoming too obviously formulaic and the antagonists were getting sillier and sillier.  Each season the people Michael's team was fighting against became ever more powerful - they could circumscribe world governments and they became less and less believable as time went on. What new super power of evil would the team be fighting against next, I asked myself after Season Four - the Devil?  I stopped buying the DVDs after Season Two - But.  I can't wait for Season Five to become available.  The creation of Anson as the antagonist is inspired.  He really could qualify as the Devil; he is so believable that it is chilling.  He has tied the previous four season together as we get glimpses into Michael's past.  The use of a highly intelligent, skilled psychologist as Michael's foe, bringing the evil back to one man, makes the series believable again.If you think of Anson as Archangel Lucifer and Michael as Archangel Michael - the two ultimate warrior foes - we could be set for an heroic battle in the next season.

1433415,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004YM6IZ6,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","I'll say up front that I've been a fan of this series since season one. The concept of a spy who is tossed aside mid-assignment by some unseen person who then tries to redeem himself and find out who burned him was an original concept. The lengths that the series has gone to stay fresh and change up the bad guys from season to season has made it remain constantly interesting and suspenseful as well as providing a mystery that is solved one small piece at a time.Along for the ride are the same cast of characters that have been there from day one. Gabrielle Anwar as Fiona Glenanne or Fi, Michael's love interest from the past is a woman with a past and a love of heavy armor. Sam Axe (Bruce Campbell) is the old friend and ex-Navy SEAL who has been around Michael longer than anyone. With the exception of Michael's mother Madeline (Sharon Gless) who continues to discover more about her son than she would like. And coming along for the ride from season four is Jesse Porter (Coby Bell), the ex-CIA agent Michael burned but who he helped regain his standing. This cast of characters and actors is a dream team always delivering the goods and never failing. It is this core group that helps make the show so wonderful to watch.But a perfect cast without a decent plot won't get you anywhere. The writing on this show is amazing. The quips tossed out by Michael and Sam are funny but my favorite part is the descriptions used to tag various characters such as ""Julio, not a nice guy"". Okay that's a bad example but once you get into the series you'll know what I'm talking about.Season five kicks off with Michael somewhat back in the good graces of the CIA. Not completely taken off the burn list, Michael is assigned a handler to keep him involved and out of trouble named Max. Unfortunately for Max, someone kills him and set up the evidence to point straight at Michael as the assassin.Agent Pearce is assigned to find out who it was that killed Max. Unable to turn to her for help, Michael and his group are trying to discover the same thing. At the same time a man who helped Michael get out of jail takes up much of Michael's time as well. Certain that this man is behind it all or at least a part of the organization that did him wrong, Michael plays out his options hoping to get enough evidence to take them down.The season ends with the actual man behind it all, the one pulling all the strings, meeting with Michael and forcing his hand. He wants Michael to take out the CIA team he's working with and to come work for him. But Fi has plans of her own when it comes to helping Michael.The twists and turns of this main plotline are interwoven with Michael and his group helping other people in need as well. It's not always just about the CIA or the covert organization beneath it all, its often about helping some poor shmuck out of a jam as well. Sometimes these are friends or acquaintances and other times its someone Michael isn't quite fond of. But a case never seems to get turned down and the group always comes through in the end.This series looks great, is acted great, written great and best of all entertains from start to finish. Season five takes Michael into a whole new world of good guys and bad guys and as has happened before who he thinks is at the core of it all turns out to be just another pawn manipulated by some higher power. As season six has begun on TV we find out more layers beneath these layers as well. I know the series will end one day. Let's just hope that the conclusion is as suspense filled as the series has been for 5 seasons.

Well, they've pretty much ditched the helping others part of the show, and Mike is devolving into a ""do anything that it takes to get what I want for the good of me"" character/spy. Bruce Campbell has been pushed back and as such, much of the humor has vanished from the show, and when they do use him, it's to cover up plot points they can't/won't explain. ""We need this really hard to get thing....oh hey, Sam, you still hanging around in the background? ? You have a friend who can take care of this, right?""The final straw was bringing in Anson. It's not like Mike hasn't been outmatched before, but it was pretty much him vs the U.S. govt. At this point Anson knows all, sees all, can manipulate time and space to be wherever he needs to be when he needs to, to heck with things like needing to drive. Why he needs Mike and the team to do anything never makes any sense, as Anson is SO powerful, that he's a dozen steps ahead of them all the time.

The video and audio are clear and sharp with this set as expected and with some added bonuses to the set too form some commentaries to a few gag reels.

I love spy thrillers anyway, and this blend of espionage and humor seemed perfect.  I thought the writing fell off a bit in the third season, and I really didn't like the introduction of the Jesse Porter character into the series in the fourth season.  I thoroughly enjoyed the relationship between Michael, Fiona and Sam, and didn't want to see another character thrown into the mix to disrupt things.  I even felt mother Madeline's character had outlived her usefullness (and still do) but I've grown to like the Jesse character and enjoy his interaction with the other three.  I really enjoyed season five, even though it had the potential to be a disaster.  The whole premise of the show is Michael Westen being burned from his agency and out in the cold and how he deals with that.  With season five, he's back with the CIA (in a manner of speaking) and I was concerned this would destroy the whole reason behind the show.  Not so.  The team behind Burn Notice did a wonderful job reintegrating Michael into the intelligence community and yet still keeping him as sort of a rogue character.  I do wish Grant Show's character could have stuck around a little longer.  I thought he made a good partner for Michael.  But I understand that his demise propelled the season storyline, so I understand.  I think Anson Fullerton is a great bad guy, and have enjoyed his scenes with the group.  I like the idea of one last bad guy from the group that burned Michael, and one who was there from the beginning.
