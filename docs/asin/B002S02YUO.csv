1286162,A3R74EHB34JTTP,B002S02YUO,Amazon Customer,"[6, 10]","I've looked at many workout DVDs over the years, and this one is easily one of my least favorites. I bought it based on the workout video clips I saw on the SparkPeople web site, and by that standard this was disappointing. It had a feel - even without the '80s Aerobics track - that made it seem more 'dated' than 'retro' and the production values felt amateurish: the set has spinning bikes and 'fan' type bicycles (why??), making it look cramped and a bit distracting.Many of the moves were recycled, 'old school' aerobics (boring!), and the kickboxing segment showed some very - and surprisingly - sloppy form. (Elbows should be close in at your sides, for example, not poked out like a halfback. I know she's not a kickboxing instructor here, but if you're going to build a workout around it, you can at least demonstrate proper, basic form.) Even on the 'jump rope' segment - where even with the 'rope' (an exercise band) laid on the floor, the instructor manages to scuff it with her shoe at one point. A very minor point, and I don't fault her for that, but you'd think that would've been edited and maybe re-shot. It just strengthens my impression that this DVD lacks polish.Each segment begins with the exact same warm-up. I'd have preferred individual warm-ups that matched each segment's 'type' to help prepare mentally - and not just physically - for what's ahead, versus the one-size-fits-all approach here. Plus, if you're planning on a 10-minute workout, nearly a third of that is warm-up.I can't say it got my heart rate going because it didn't even inspire me or motivate me to try. And that's a shame since I had it on my wish list before it was released. Since I have others that are better, I won't be keeping this one.",2,Dated feel and lacks polish,1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,1740,"[""'ve"", 'looked', 'many', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'years', 'one', 'easily', 'one', 'least', 'favorites', 'bought', 'based', 'workout', 'video', 'clips', 'saw', 'SparkPeople', 'web', 'site', 'standard', 'was', 'disappointing', 'had', 'feel', 'even', ""'80s"", 'Aerobics', 'track', 'made', 'seem', 'more', ""'dated"", ""'retro"", 'production', 'values', 'felt', 'amateurish', 'set', 'spinning', 'bikes', ""'fan"", 'type', 'bicycles', 'why', 'making', 'look', 'cramped', 'bit', 'distracting.Many', 'moves', 'were', 'recycled', ""'old"", 'school', 'aerobics', 'boring', 'kickboxing', 'segment', 'showed', 'very', 'surprisingly', 'sloppy', 'form', 'Elbows', 'should', 'be', 'close', 'sides', 'example', 'not', 'poked', 'out', 'halfback', 'know', 'not', 'kickboxing', 'instructor', 'here', ""'re"", 'going', 'build', 'workout', 'can', 'least', 'demonstrate', 'proper', 'basic', 'form', 'Even', ""'jump"", 'rope', 'segment', 'where', 'even', ""'rope"", 'exercise', 'band', 'laid', 'floor', 'instructor', 'scuff', 'shoe', 'one', 'point', 'very', 'minor', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'fault', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'edited', 'maybe', 're-shot', 'just', 'strengthens', 'impression', 'DVD', 'polish.Each', 'segment', 'exact', 'same', 'warm-up', ""'d"", 'have', 'preferred', 'individual', 'warm-ups', 'matched', 'segment', ""'type"", 'help', 'prepare', 'mentally', 'not', 'just', 'physically', 'what', 'ahead', 'one-size-fits-all', 'approach', 'here', ""'re"", 'planning', '10-minute', 'workout', 'nearly', 'third', 'warm-up.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'got', 'heart', 'rate', 'going', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'inspire', 'motivate', 'try', 'shame', 'had', 'wish', 'list', 'was', 'released', 'have', 'others', 'are', 'better', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'keeping', 'one']",N/A

I plan on using it to add a worout before work.  These workouts are not too difficult and are short but you have the option to combine them into a longer workout.

1286168,A231KSL42Z60CQ,B002S02YUO,Melissa McKenzie,"[6, 8]","I was looking for something fun and ideally an 80s retro DVD.  I remember growing up and watching my mom doing all of these classic exercises so when I saw this one had at 80s section I knew I had to get it, but I'm sorry I did.I was completely bored!  I was counting down the seconds until I could move to the next section because I felt the first three sections were more like warm ups than workout and I was literally just going through the motions.  The first two sections were low intensity and the kickboxing was a little better, but not at all what I was used to.  Kickboxing is one of my favorite exercises but this just lacked the same intensity and enjoyment I get out of other DVDs.  By the time I got halfway through the fourth section I just turned off the DVD  I was finally breaking a sweat, but I felt like I had already wasted 30 minutes that could have been better utilized doing something else.  The final three sections are the most intense and perhaps if I had done those first I would have felt better about this DVD.  If you want to get a decent workout you have to start the DVD at the jumping sections, however, you will still end up bored.  The moves are very repetitive and you get tired of doing the move long before you're physically tired.Nicole is super cute and sweet and I love her stuff on SparkPeople, but the music is horrendous, and I don't really see myself doing again in the future.I really wanted to love this one, but I unfortunately just didn't get much of anything out of it.",2,BORING!,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,1519,"['was', 'looking', 'something', 'fun', 'ideally', '80s', 'retro', 'DVD', 'remember', 'growing', 'up', 'watching', 'mom', 'doing', 'classic', 'exercises', 'so', 'when', 'saw', 'one', 'had', '80s', 'section', 'knew', 'had', 'get', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'did.I', 'was', 'completely', 'bored', 'was', 'counting', 'down', 'seconds', 'could', 'move', 'next', 'section', 'felt', 'first', 'three', 'sections', 'were', 'more', 'warm', 'ups', 'workout', 'was', 'literally', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'first', 'two', 'sections', 'were', 'low', 'intensity', 'kickboxing', 'was', 'little', 'better', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'used', 'Kickboxing', 'one', 'favorite', 'exercises', 'just', 'lacked', 'same', 'intensity', 'enjoyment', 'get', 'other', 'DVDs', 'time', 'got', 'halfway', 'fourth', 'section', 'just', 'turned', 'off', 'DVD', 'was', 'finally', 'breaking', 'sweat', 'felt', 'had', 'already', 'wasted', '30', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'utilized', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'final', 'three', 'sections', 'are', 'most', 'intense', 'perhaps', 'had', 'done', 'first', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'better', 'DVD', 'want', 'get', 'decent', 'workout', 'have', 'start', 'DVD', 'jumping', 'sections', 'however', 'will', 'still', 'end', 'up', 'bored', 'moves', 'are', 'very', 'repetitive', 'get', 'tired', 'doing', 'move', 'long', ""'re"", 'physically', 'tired.Nicole', 'super', 'cute', 'sweet', 'love', 'stuff', 'SparkPeople', 'music', 'horrendous', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'doing', 'again', 'future.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'one', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'anything']",N/A
