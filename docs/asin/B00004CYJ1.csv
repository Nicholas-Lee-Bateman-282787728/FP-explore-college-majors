Don Johnson is as cool as a cucumber that he can kill people without breaking a sweat. Don Johnson is so cool that he can get his head split open after a spectacular fall. Well, Guilty as Sin is directed by Sidney Lumet, and I naturally have high expectations from him. Guilty as Sin sort of reaches them yet comes out as a clunker by the disappointing ending. Not much happens at the end; they both fall out, he dies, and the female lawyer survives. It just ends like that. That's great. Rebecca De Mornay, of course, looks hot for a lawyer and is too cool to play as one. Hmm, I think the word ""cool"" is being overused here, and that's the problem with Guilty as Sin. There is too much coolness and confidence, so am I supposed to believe that people can do it that easily when murder happens? I like the casting of Jack Warden, but much more can have been done with his character.
