Also there are a lot of unreleased music on this DVD that is different from the CD of the same title.  PLUS there are 2 bonus songs in the &quot;game&quot; section.

My only complaint is that his video for &quot;Millennium&quot; IS NOT included here (which is strange since that's really the only hit he's had so far in the U.S.) That video is not on his &quot;Where Egos Dare&quot; DVD either (a DVD that was cancelled for U.S. release, but can be found as a Canadian release rather easily- that DVD is is a must buy for all Robbie fans as well.  It's got even more extras than this one does!) Don't miss out on this DVD- I would not be surprised if it went out of print at some point.

475133,A2GZTI0EIOCQNZ,6305739609,"M. Hind ""daria_m""","[19, 20]","Robbie Williams is one of the most creative, tongue-in-cheek lyricists in the world.  His songs cover a wide range of emotions, from sadness to love, from arrogance to insecurity, from pain to unabashed fun.  But since this is a DVD, I will focus more on Mr. Williams' visual appeal.There are seven videos featured on this disc (two are available if you conquer the Find the Joker game).  Here's each one in a nutshell:""Angels"" - a stunning, black-and-white video with gorgeous cinematography and simplicity.  Probably the best I've ever seen him do.  It's no wonder that the song and the video were (and still are) wildly popular in the UK.""Lazy Days"" - As Robbie explains, he was ""mad"" during this video as it was filmed during one of his stints in rehab.  There are some interesting camera effects in this one and some cool tricks involving small floating mirrors.""South of the Border"" - Robbie and his band perform in a building that is on fire.  As the heat goes up, the band members and their instruments begin to sweat.  You literally feel the heat while watching it.  Good concept.""Heaven From Here"" and ""Grace"" - Both videos are comprised of vacation footage shot by Williams' writing partner Guy Chambers.  ""HFH,"" a slower song, features softer moments, while ""Grace"" gets fun with a karaoke feel.""Get the Joke"" - A live studio video, kind of an Unplugged moment for Robbie.  Very simple, not visual at all, but the song is still enjoyable.The extras on the disk are pretty good.  His poetry renditions offer a nice break from his crazy pop idol persona and allows us to get into his head a bit.  There are also a couple of short interviews, including one where he discusses how he knew ""Angels"" was going to be a hit.My only beef:  I wish there were more videos available!  There are many I have not seen yet.This is a great gift for any Robbie fan and also a wonderful way to introduce a non-believer to a great artist.  I would like to see Robbie Williams try again with the American audience.

Angels, Heaven from Here, Man Machine, etc are all here - in addition, the bonus footage of Robbie reading poetry, rehearsing backstage with his bandmates (Get the Joke) and tons of home video material round out this DVD.Unlike many artists who get wrapped up in acting/looking perfect whenever the cameras are rolling, RW is not afraid to be himself, often at his own expense, and his music and videos are that much better for it.For an even better DVD, check out &quot;Where Egos Dare&quot; - a newly released documentary and concert from a 1999 performance at Slane Castle in the UK.

475135,A1T4IVIH6NUEXF,6305739609,sand-da-man,"[7, 9]","THE EARLY WORKPurely by accident, my exploration into the world that is  Robbie Williams has been going in reverse chronological order. I first viewed the Knebworth Concert DVD, then Live at Albert Hall, now this. The quality or entertainment value seems to work in inverse proportion as well. The latest has more, the earliest, less. This DVD, released in 1999, is much shorter than the other two and is essentially a package of studio-produced, VH1 or MTV-type videos for the singles records. It therefore immediately suffers by comparison, not least of which because performing live is Robbie's strength. Of the video selections, only Angels is worthwhile: singularly memorable, it is a tour de force. It is as moving as the recording, explaining why that song was such an initial success, and it alone can be an argument for buying this DVD. Come to think of it, it's probably the reason I did. Not surprisingly, in one of the additional sections entitled &quot;Interview,&quot; Williams also briefly describes the genesis and meaning of that composition. The &quot;Poems&quot; section presents the author being shot against a blank white background, briefly reading some of his verse without any musical accompaniment, as if he were in the local library. If nothing else it provides a brief glimpse into the character of Robbie's lyrical genius and the instincts which drive it. Given the date, the footage also reveals a seemingly more innocent Robbie-sans-tatoos, almost symbolically showing us the boy before the deluge. Indeed, overall this is a prettier picture of an early(earlier) Williams whose star has just begun to rise. Consequently, his budding art, like the artist himself, is much more tame and rudimentary than the  edgier, more sophisticated (in some instances) material that would characterize his later work. My suggestion: pass on this for now, view the more recent (live) DVD releases, then come back perhaps to measure how far our Robbie has come.",3,It's early and it's too pretty,1084406400,"05 13, 2004",2004,1974,"['EARLY', 'WORKPurely', 'accident', 'exploration', 'world', 'Robbie', 'Williams', 'been', 'going', 'reverse', 'chronological', 'order', 'first', 'viewed', 'Knebworth', 'Concert', 'DVD', 'then', 'Live', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'now', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'value', 'work', 'inverse', 'proportion', 'as', 'well', 'latest', 'more', 'earliest', 'less', 'DVD', 'released', '1999', 'much', 'shorter', 'other', 'two', 'essentially', 'package', 'studio-produced', 'VH1', 'MTV-type', 'videos', 'singles', 'records', 'therefore', 'immediately', 'suffers', 'comparison', 'not', 'least', 'performing', 'live', 'Robbie', 'strength', 'video', 'selections', 'only', 'Angels', 'worthwhile', 'singularly', 'memorable', 'tour', 'force', 'as', 'moving', 'recording', 'explaining', 'why', 'song', 'was', 'such', 'initial', 'success', 'alone', 'can', 'be', 'argument', 'buying', 'DVD', 'Come', 'think', 'probably', 'reason', 'did', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'one', 'additional', 'sections', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Interview', 'quot', 'Williams', 'also', 'briefly', 'genesis', 'meaning', 'composition', 'quot', 'Poems', 'quot', 'section', 'author', 'being', 'shot', 'blank', 'white', 'background', 'briefly', 'reading', 'verse', 'musical', 'accompaniment', 'were', 'local', 'library', 'nothing', 'else', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'character', 'Robbie', 'lyrical', 'genius', 'instincts', 'drive', 'Given', 'date', 'footage', 'also', 'seemingly', 'more', 'innocent', 'Robbie-sans-tatoos', 'almost', 'symbolically', 'showing', 'boy', 'deluge', 'Indeed', 'overall', 'prettier', 'picture', 'early', 'earlier', 'Williams', 'star', 'just', 'begun', 'rise', 'Consequently', 'budding', 'art', 'artist', 'much', 'more', 'tame', 'rudimentary', 'edgier', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'instances', 'material', 'would', 'characterize', 'later', 'work', 'suggestion', 'pass', 'now', 'view', 'more', 'recent', 'live', 'DVD', 'then', 'come', 'back', 'perhaps', 'measure', 'how', 'far', 'Robbie', 'come']",N/A
