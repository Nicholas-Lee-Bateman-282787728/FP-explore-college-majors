I did not give it enough of a chance to play out. I am so used to Keifer Sutherland's movies and &#34;24&#34; that I got spoiled.

I got it as one of four - along with `Along For The Ride', `Across The Tracks' and `Deadfall'. I never knew Brotherhood of Justice was a TV `movie' until the credits started - you know how a TV movie always has those horrible credits? No wonder I couldn't find anything about it in cinema stuff.It's your basic storyline: a few guys think they can rid their school of all the lowlifes and drug dealers and what not. They think they're the police. They take it upon themselves to do this, and it all goes horribly wrong.Keanu Reeves is the main focus of the film, playing Derek. He has a girlfriend, and he seems to me, to be totally possessive of her. Having to see her during school, meet her for lunch, meet her after school, meet her after work . . . And then acts all jealous when she starts working with Kiefer Sutherland's character, who wouldn't be that much of a [danger], until Derek started acting [silly]. You could tell that relationship would go into meltdown pretty quickly.Most of this film's actors were unknowns, though some of them went on to become big in the movie world. Billy Zane (who becomes the big head during Brotherhood of Justice) went on to star in the `Back To The Future' trilogy, that film with Nicole Kidman `Dead Calm', and played the snooty Cal Hockley in `Titanic'. Kiefer Sutherland has made a name for himself recently, starring in the TV series `24'. And Keanu Reeves . . . Well; I could go on forever with him, couldn't I? He has starred in a few turkeys in his time, and has made a name for himself from movies such as `Speed', `Johnny Mnemonic', `Matrix', `A Walk In The Clouds', and the `Bill & Ted' movies. You decide which ones were the turkeys!Contrary to what SOME people say, Keanu Reeves is not ""wooden"" in all his films. Although, I'm sorry, to say, he is in this film. In his defence, it was one of his early films. He acts wooden, and his lines are just spoken without any emotion. And with that bad 80s haircut, and clothes . . .This film isn't really worth watching, unless you're a big fan of Keanu Reeves. It won't be easy to find either, considering it's a TV movie, and is not well known.",2,Keanu as A Vigilante,1060992000,"08 16, 2003",2003,2239,"['Thankfully', 'got', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'cheap', 'cos', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'liked', 'buy', 'full', 'price', 'got', 'one', 'four', 'Along', 'Ride', 'Tracks', 'Deadfall', 'never', 'knew', 'Brotherhood', 'Justice', 'was', 'TV', 'movie', 'credits', 'started', 'know', 'how', 'TV', 'movie', 'always', 'horrible', 'credits', 'wonder', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'cinema', 'stuff.It', 'basic', 'storyline', 'few', 'guys', 'think', 'can', 'rid', 'school', 'lowlifes', 'drug', 'dealers', 'what', 'not', 'think', ""'re"", 'police', 'take', 'do', 'horribly', 'wrong.Keanu', 'Reeves', 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'playing', 'Derek', 'girlfriend', 'be', 'totally', 'possessive', 'Having', 'see', 'school', 'meet', 'lunch', 'meet', 'school', 'meet', 'work', 'then', 'jealous', 'when', 'working', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'character', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'that', 'much', '[', 'danger', ']', 'Derek', 'started', 'acting', '[', 'silly', ']', 'could', 'tell', 'relationship', 'would', 'go', 'meltdown', 'pretty', 'quickly.Most', 'film', 'actors', 'were', 'unknowns', 'went', 'become', 'big', 'movie', 'world', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'who', 'big', 'head', 'Brotherhood', 'Justice', 'went', 'star', 'Back', 'Future', 'trilogy', 'film', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Dead', 'Calm', 'played', 'snooty', 'Cal', 'Hockley', 'Titanic', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'made', 'name', 'recently', 'starring', 'TV', 'series', '24', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Well', 'could', 'go', 'forever', 'could', ""n't"", 'starred', 'few', 'turkeys', 'time', 'made', 'name', 'movies', 'such', 'Speed', 'Johnny', 'Mnemonic', 'Matrix', 'Walk', 'Clouds', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'movies', 'decide', 'ones', 'were', 'turkeys', 'Contrary', 'what', 'SOME', 'people', 'say', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'not', 'wooden', 'films', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'film', 'defence', 'was', 'one', 'early', 'films', 'wooden', 'lines', 'are', 'just', 'spoken', 'emotion', 'bad', '80s', 'haircut', 'clothes', '.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'worth', 'watching', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'easy', 'find', 'either', 'considering', 'TV', 'movie', 'not', 'well', 'known']",N/A

294829,A3SAU1A0IEYDNX,6302088712,Soaring Heart,"[39, 46]","If you have children, this would be a very good movie to teach them a lesson with.Talented Keanu Reeves convincingly plays Derek, a quarterback and natural born leader of a group who later call themselves  &quot;The Brotherhood of Justice.&quot; They form after a senior high  school meeting led by the Principal, discusses vandalism and thefts going  on at their school.  He doesn't realize he is doing it, but he's really  what started this &quot;mess&quot; in the first place.The  &quot;revenge&quot; begins controlled. It actually makes sense at first;  but violence just grows like a brush fire. Each &quot;punishment&quot; by  the brotherhood gets more violent.  Derek, played by Keanu, calls it stops  and not a second too late.The ending is very good; parents will be proud  to see justice done.  I recommend you sit down and watch this entire movie  with your children, explaining and answering questions as the movie  progresses.  There are some excellent role models to watch; not only Keanu  Reeves, but Lori Loughlin and Kiefer Sutherland as well.&quot;The  Brotherhood of Justice&quot; is rated M for mature audiences. Whether  you're an adolescent, teen or adult (single or married); everyone can  relate to and get something out of this movie.  I highly recommend buying  this one.",5,RETURNING VIOLENCE WITH VIOLENCE ONLY MAKES THINGS WORSE,961027200,"06 15, 2000",2000,1297,"['have', 'children', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'teach', 'lesson', 'with.Talented', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'convincingly', 'Derek', 'quarterback', 'natural', 'born', 'leader', 'group', 'who', 'later', 'call', 'quot', 'Brotherhood', 'Justice.', 'quot', 'form', 'senior', 'high', 'school', 'meeting', 'led', 'Principal', 'vandalism', 'thefts', 'going', 'school', ""n't"", 'realize', 'doing', 'really', 'what', 'started', 'quot', 'mess', 'quot', 'first', 'place.The', 'quot', 'revenge', 'quot', 'controlled', 'actually', 'sense', 'first', 'violence', 'just', 'brush', 'fire', 'quot', 'punishment', 'quot', 'brotherhood', 'more', 'violent', 'Derek', 'played', 'Keanu', 'not', 'second', 'too', 'late.The', 'ending', 'very', 'good', 'parents', 'will', 'be', 'proud', 'see', 'justice', 'done', 'recommend', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'entire', 'movie', 'children', 'explaining', 'answering', 'questions', 'movie', 'are', 'excellent', 'role', 'models', 'watch', 'not', 'only', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Lori', 'Loughlin', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'well.', 'quot', 'Brotherhood', 'Justice', 'quot', 'rated', 'M', 'mature', 'audiences', ""'re"", 'adolescent', 'teen', 'adult', 'single', 'married', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'get', 'something', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'buying', 'one']",N/A
