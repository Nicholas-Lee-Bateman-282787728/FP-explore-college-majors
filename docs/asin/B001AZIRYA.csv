The audience was packed, and the host told us that one person laughed so hard he burst a hernia and had to be taken out in an ambulance. I'm not surprised. Dozens of voices, odd characters, strange movements, and virtually everything improvised. The host managed to get in a few serious questions, but Williams' answers were more in the way of demonstrations than explanations. For example, in pointing out that almost anything can provide inspiration, he borrowed a pink scarf or shawl from a lady in the front row and did about ten minutes of using that piece of fabric with fringes on the two short ends to be just about anything he wanted.The most serious part is at the end, when the students ask him questions directly. It becomes clear that Williams cares deeply about their talents and their dreams. A joy to watch all the way through an episode about twice the length of the Johnny Depp episode (which I also reviewed).",5,Inside the Mind of a Comic Genius With a Serious Side,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,974,"['Seems', ""'m"", 'not', 'alone', 'loving', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'audience', 'was', 'packed', 'host', 'told', 'one', 'person', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'hernia', 'had', 'be', 'taken', 'out', 'ambulance', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'Dozens', 'voices', 'odd', 'characters', 'strange', 'movements', 'virtually', 'everything', 'improvised', 'host', 'managed', 'get', 'few', 'serious', 'questions', 'Williams', 'answers', 'were', 'more', 'way', 'demonstrations', 'explanations', 'example', 'pointing', 'out', 'almost', 'anything', 'can', 'provide', 'inspiration', 'borrowed', 'pink', 'scarf', 'shawl', 'lady', 'front', 'row', 'did', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'using', 'piece', 'fabric', 'fringes', 'two', 'short', 'ends', 'be', 'just', 'anything', 'most', 'serious', 'part', 'end', 'when', 'students', 'ask', 'questions', 'directly', 'clear', 'Williams', 'deeply', 'talents', 'dreams', 'joy', 'watch', 'way', 'episode', 'twice', 'length', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'episode', 'also', 'reviewed']",Robin Williams: Inside The Actors Studio

1169345,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B001AZIRYA,Eric S. Kim,"[0, 0]","""Inside the Actor's Studio"" is pretty straightforward: James Lipton interviews actors with important questions, and nothing is over-stylized with MTV music or clever camera angles. It's rare to see an episode where it just turns wild. This particular episode with Robin Williams is different from most episodes because it's so humorous. Sometimes Lipton would have to wait in order to ask the next question because Robin's answers are filled with unexpected improvisations. In fact, the first question is delayed just because Robin can't stop joking around with both Lipton and the audience. There is one audience member who simply cannot stop laughing because Robin just won't stop with the hilarious jokes (I have to admit, though, that her laugh is a bit distracting from beginning to end). This episode is still worthy of watching straight through, because there's a lot of insight on where and how all this comedy originated, and how he is able to improvise so quickly. It's a fascinating episode, and it's a must-see for all Robin Williams fans.NOTE: The original episode ran for about four hours, but this DVD has only one hundred minutes worth of footage. Maybe in the future, we'll be able to see the entire interview, but for now, a hundred minutes is enough.Grade: 8.5/10",4,"Robin Williams appears in a VERY fun episode of ""ITAS""",1282262400,"08 20, 2010",2010,1282,"['Actor', 'Studio', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'James', 'Lipton', 'actors', 'important', 'questions', 'nothing', 'over-stylized', 'MTV', 'music', 'clever', 'camera', 'rare', 'see', 'episode', 'where', 'just', 'wild', 'particular', 'episode', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'different', 'most', 'episodes', 'so', 'humorous', 'Sometimes', 'Lipton', 'would', 'have', 'wait', 'order', 'ask', 'next', 'question', 'Robin', 'answers', 'are', 'filled', 'unexpected', 'improvisations', 'fact', 'first', 'question', 'delayed', 'just', 'Robin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'joking', 'Lipton', 'audience', 'one', 'audience', 'member', 'who', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'laughing', 'Robin', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'hilarious', 'jokes', 'have', 'admit', 'though', 'laugh', 'bit', 'distracting', 'beginning', 'end', 'episode', 'still', 'worthy', 'watching', 'straight', 'lot', 'insight', 'where', 'how', 'comedy', 'originated', 'how', 'able', 'improvise', 'so', 'quickly', 'fascinating', 'episode', 'must-see', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'fans.NOTE', 'original', 'episode', 'ran', 'four', 'hours', 'DVD', 'only', 'one', 'hundred', 'minutes', 'footage', 'Maybe', 'future', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'see', 'entire', 'interview', 'now', 'hundred', 'minutes', 'enough.Grade', '8.5/10']",Robin Williams: Inside The Actors Studio
1169346,ANPE9R0D2G8AO,B001AZIRYA,Inanna Arthen,"[1, 1]","Actors Studio Drama School alumnus Robin Williams was interviewed by Lipton on January 29, 2001, and the resulting episode of *Inside the Actors Studio* became one of the most popular that Bravo ever aired. In his inimitable style, Williams takes control of the evening away from his host the moment he steps onto the stage, and spends more than five hours (from which the original two-hour episode was edited) committing serial improvisation for the very entertained students. He also, when Lipton can get a word in edgewise, answers questions, discussing his childhood, different film roles and how he moved from stand-up comedy to acting.The DVD version is extremely enjoyable. Everything that made the original broadcast episode so popular is intact, along with additional footage from Williams' live interview. It's futile to say any more about it, because Robin Williams can't be described - you just have to watch him, and repeated viewings are recommended. Sometimes he's gleefully predictable: when Lipton ingenuously asks Williams if he has an introverted side, we know exactly how Williams will respond, and we're just waiting for it. But more typically, Williams takes Lipton and us on the kind of roller-coaster ride we've come to expect from this brilliant comedian and actor.  Only two things about this DVD disappointed me.James Lipton takes up a bit too much of the allotted time, speaking for four and half minutes at the beginning of the interview. There is a dictum among writers: ""show, don't tell."" Lipton talks at great length, needlessly describing things we're about to see in the interview, when all we, as viewers, want is to see Williams himself. Lipton's tone and demeanor toward his subjects are so reverential, he could be delivering their eulogies, a mood that the soft, somber series theme music underscores. But his respect would be better expressed by stepping aside and giving his subjects the center stage.Along with this, I was slightly offended that the producers of the DVD saw fit to ""bleep"" Robin Williams' speech when he says something that normally couldn't be broadcast on network TV. No one expects this kind of coy caution on a commercial DVD. It's also rather absurd to bleep out individual words when much of the physical content of Williams' improvisation involves sexual humor that skirts the edges of obscene. In his introduction, Lipton promises us Robin Williams ""unleashed, uncensored [and] uncut.""  I'm sorry to say that Lipton isn't being truthful.Despite these nuisances, *Inside the Actors Studio: Robin Williams* is well-produced and worth the price. Theatre students, teachers, and fans of Robin Williams will all enjoy and learn from this interview.  The DVD includes about 30 minutes of extra footage that didn't make it into the final episode.",4,a riotous improvisational lesson on comedy and acting,1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,2807,"['Actors', 'Studio', 'Drama', 'School', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'was', 'interviewed', 'Lipton', 'January', '29', '2001', 'resulting', 'episode', 'Actors', 'Studio*', 'became', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'Bravo', 'ever', 'aired', 'inimitable', 'style', 'Williams', 'control', 'evening', 'away', 'host', 'moment', 'stage', 'more', 'five', 'hours', 'original', 'two-hour', 'episode', 'was', 'edited', 'committing', 'serial', 'improvisation', 'very', 'entertained', 'students', 'also', 'when', 'Lipton', 'can', 'get', 'word', 'edgewise', 'answers', 'questions', 'discussing', 'childhood', 'different', 'film', 'roles', 'how', 'moved', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'acting.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'Everything', 'made', 'original', 'broadcast', 'episode', 'popular', 'intact', 'additional', 'footage', 'Williams', 'live', 'interview', 'futile', 'say', 'more', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'described', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'are', 'recommended', 'gleefully', 'predictable', 'when', 'Lipton', 'ingenuously', 'Williams', 'introverted', 'side', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'Williams', 'will', 'respond', ""'re"", 'just', 'waiting', 'more', 'typically', 'Williams', 'Lipton', 'kind', 'roller-coaster', 'ride', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'brilliant', 'comedian', 'actor', 'Only', 'two', 'things', 'DVD', 'disappointed', 'me.James', 'Lipton', 'up', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'allotted', 'time', 'speaking', 'four', 'half', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'interview', 'dictum', 'writers', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Lipton', 'talks', 'great', 'length', 'needlessly', 'describing', 'things', ""'re"", 'see', 'interview', 'when', 'viewers', 'want', 'see', 'Williams', 'Lipton', 'tone', 'demeanor', 'subjects', 'are', 'so', 'reverential', 'could', 'be', 'delivering', 'eulogies', 'mood', 'soft', 'somber', 'series', 'theme', 'music', 'underscores', 'respect', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'expressed', 'stepping', 'aside', 'giving', 'subjects', 'center', 'stage.Along', 'was', 'slightly', 'offended', 'producers', 'DVD', 'saw', 'fit', 'bleep', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'speech', 'when', 'something', 'normally', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'broadcast', 'network', 'TV', 'one', 'kind', 'coy', 'caution', 'commercial', 'DVD', 'also', 'rather', 'absurd', 'bleep', 'out', 'individual', 'words', 'when', 'much', 'physical', 'content', 'Williams', 'improvisation', 'sexual', 'humor', 'edges', 'obscene', 'introduction', 'Lipton', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'unleashed', 'uncensored', '[', ']', 'uncut', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'Lipton', ""n't"", 'being', 'truthful.Despite', 'nuisances', 'Actors', 'Studio', 'Robin', 'Williams*', 'well-produced', 'worth', 'price', 'Theatre', 'students', 'teachers', 'fans', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'will', 'enjoy', 'learn', 'interview', 'DVD', '30', 'minutes', 'extra', 'footage', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'final', 'episode']",Robin Williams: Inside The Actors Studio
