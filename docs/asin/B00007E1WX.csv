Mr. Breen poses as a beginning copy writer and gets to know the staff. We notice that Mr. Breen is too well dressed for the part and looking closer we recognize him as...Lord Peter (Ian Carmichael) used the address of the empty apartment owned by his brother-in-law Chief Inspector Parker (Mark Eden) and sister Lady Mary (Rachel Herbert)While Lord Peter is doing his investigation of the mysterious doings at Pym's, Chief Inspector Parker is investigation dope smuggling. Their paths cross frequently.Is there a link?And was Victor Dean just a victim of an accident?Watch and find out.You may notice that Ian Carmichael is really showing his age in this film and is just a tad old for the part.They took the time to put just about everything relevant from the book in to this production. There were a few exceptions but not worth bothering about. The production is complete enough that you do not have to read the book.Dorothy L. Sayers writes many non-fiction books however among her best is the Lord Peter Wimsey series. I came to this series sort of though the back door. My first taste was the BBC productions with Petherbridge as Lord Peter, which can now be found on DVD and as a set of Lord Peter stories. So I read all of Dorothy's books containing the relationship of Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane.

726991,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B00007E1WX,drkhimxz,"[0, 0]","It is, indeed, difficult to believe that we have lost both Bertie Wooster and Lord Peter Wimsey. Of course, by that I mean that Ian Carmichael, versatile British actor, died this year, 2010. While frequently playing serious roles after his discharge from military service following WW 2, his greatest contribution to PUBLIC WELL-BEING was in recreating for television two classic literary characters, P.C. Wodehouse's, Bertie Wooster, and Dorothy Sayers, Lord Peter Wimsey. Wodehouse is generally considered the foremost literary humorist of the 20th Century and Sayers is securely situated as one of the founding mothers of the modern British detective novel. Carmichael recreated both in such manner on television as to continue their lives far beyond what reissues of the books, were there to have been any without his characterizations, would have accomplished.Murder Must Advertise requires Wimsey to appear as an amiable, but rather silly, substitute copy writer in an advertising agency. As Carmichael says in an interview, included on one of the two discs, he plays Wimsey as a fundamentally serious person with the surface of Wooster, which masks his detectival activities. There are a number of interesting characters in the agency, a bit of witty badinage, and a deadly crime, leavening the interaction. Lovers of the Sayers book should find this rendering to their taste, while newcomers may develop an itch for the further adventures to be found recounted in other DVD's. The picture and color are fine for 1973, and the sound as good as British accents can be made to appear to American ears.Certainly, I had a jolly good time.

726992,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00007E1WX,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 2]","Dorothy L. Sayers (1893-1957) wrote comparatively few mystery novels, but they were more than sufficient to make her as widely admired as the more prolific Agatha Christie and Ngaio Marsh.  MURDER MUST ADVERTISE was published in 1933; fifty years later it at last reached the television screen with a 1973 BBC production.  The series starred Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter Wimsey, Sayer's titled sleuth, which he played in several BBC adaptations of Sayers novels.Now, there will no doubt be the pulling of hair and gnashing of teeth when I say this, but Sayers was what you might call a very literary writer, by which I mean that her way of telling a story was more important than the details of the story itself, and her sharp humor, her clever plots, and her intriguing characters have never translated to the screen very well.  This is as true of this series and these actors as they are the other attempts to put the novels on screen.  It doesn't work well because what usually emerges on film is a lot of people sitting around drinking tea and chatting, and few things can be more dull than that.MURDER MUST ADVERTISE isn't quite that bad, but the simple fact of it is that you probably won't be able to follow it unless you've read the novel first.  And make no mistake: although she herself was a little ify about it, this is one of Sayers' best works, the tale of a young man working for an advertising agency who suddenly falls to his death down a spiral staircase.  Was it accident?  The office would like to think so.  Was it murder?  Well, there is a suggestive letter he was writing not long before his death.  The agency soon calls in Lord Peter Wimsey, who disguises himself as working man Death Bredon, takes a job as a copywriter, and soon finds himself up to his monocle in a drug trafficing scheme that is somehow worked out the ad agency's office.  But how?  And by who?  And what does all this have to do with the murdered man any way?The whole thing is very, very BBC series of the period, if you know what I mean: everything is quickly done, and it is easy to spot where they really should have done a re-take or two; everything is very inexpensive, and the costumes and sets are never entirely convincing.  But we must give the show its due.  Director Rodney Bennett keeps it moving at a fast clip, and writer Rodney Bennett has done as good a job possible adapting the story for the screen--fans of the novel will recognize large chunks of the dialogue and many of Sayers most memorable zingers lifted directly from book to script.  Although he lacks Wimsey's icy quality, Ian Carmichael isn't bad as Lord Peter, but on the whole I would describe the actors as expert instead of gifted.  The DVD has little in the way of extras, but it does offer an interview with Carmichael that is rather fun.When all is said and done, this really is probably as good as a film adaptation of a Sayers novel can be--and although the 1987 series starring Edward Petherbridge had its own charms and failings, this series comes out slightly ahead on the cast, writing, and direction.  Recommended, yes, but only for those who are already fans of Sayers novels.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,"A Staircase Murder, Cocaine, and Lord Peter Wimsey",1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,3186,"['Dorothy', 'L.', 'Sayers', '1893-1957', 'wrote', 'comparatively', 'few', 'mystery', 'novels', 'were', 'more', 'sufficient', 'make', 'widely', 'admired', 'more', 'prolific', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'Ngaio', 'Marsh', 'MURDER', 'MUST', 'ADVERTISE', 'was', 'published', '1933', 'fifty', 'years', 'later', 'last', 'reached', 'television', 'screen', '1973', 'BBC', 'production', 'series', 'starred', 'Ian', 'Carmichael', 'Lord', 'Peter', 'Wimsey', 'Sayer', 'titled', 'sleuth', 'played', 'several', 'BBC', 'adaptations', 'Sayers', 'novels.Now', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'pulling', 'hair', 'gnashing', 'teeth', 'when', 'say', 'Sayers', 'was', 'what', 'might', 'call', 'very', 'literary', 'writer', 'mean', 'way', 'telling', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'important', 'details', 'story', 'sharp', 'humor', 'clever', 'plots', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'have', 'never', 'translated', 'screen', 'very', 'well', 'true', 'series', 'actors', 'are', 'other', 'attempts', 'put', 'novels', 'screen', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'what', 'usually', 'film', 'lot', 'people', 'sitting', 'drinking', 'tea', 'chatting', 'few', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'dull', 'that.MURDER', 'MUST', 'ADVERTISE', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bad', 'simple', 'fact', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'follow', ""'ve"", 'read', 'novel', 'first', 'make', 'mistake', 'was', 'little', 'ify', 'one', 'Sayers', 'best', 'works', 'tale', 'young', 'man', 'working', 'advertising', 'agency', 'who', 'suddenly', 'death', 'down', 'spiral', 'staircase', 'Was', 'accident', 'office', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'so', 'Was', 'murder', 'Well', 'suggestive', 'letter', 'was', 'writing', 'not', 'long', 'death', 'agency', 'soon', 'Lord', 'Peter', 'Wimsey', 'who', 'working', 'man', 'Death', 'Bredon', 'job', 'copywriter', 'soon', 'finds', 'monocle', 'drug', 'trafficing', 'scheme', 'somehow', 'worked', 'out', 'ad', 'agency', 'office', 'how', 'who', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'murdered', 'man', 'way', 'whole', 'thing', 'very', 'very', 'BBC', 'series', 'period', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'everything', 'quickly', 'done', 'easy', 'spot', 'where', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'done', 're-take', 'two', 'everything', 'very', 'inexpensive', 'costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'never', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'must', 'give', 'show', 'due', 'Director', 'Rodney', 'Bennett', 'moving', 'fast', 'clip', 'writer', 'Rodney', 'Bennett', 'done', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'possible', 'adapting', 'story', 'screen', 'fans', 'novel', 'will', 'recognize', 'large', 'chunks', 'dialogue', 'many', 'Sayers', 'most', 'memorable', 'zingers', 'lifted', 'directly', 'book', 'script', 'Wimsey', 'icy', 'quality', 'Ian', 'Carmichael', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Lord', 'Peter', 'whole', 'would', 'describe', 'actors', 'expert', 'instead', 'gifted', 'DVD', 'little', 'way', 'extras', 'offer', 'interview', 'Carmichael', 'rather', 'fun.When', 'said', 'done', 'really', 'probably', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Sayers', 'novel', 'can', 'be', '1987', 'series', 'starring', 'Edward', 'Petherbridge', 'had', 'own', 'charms', 'failings', 'series', 'out', 'slightly', 'ahead', 'cast', 'writing', 'direction', 'Recommended', 'yes', 'only', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'fans', 'Sayers', 'novels.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",Lord Peter Wimsey - Murder Must Advertise
