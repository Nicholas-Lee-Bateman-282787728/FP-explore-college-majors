But the local police sergeant played by Albert Finney is crazy about her, and more than a little crazy in general.

Add in some smuggling, IRA bombs, a bombastic Catholic priest and the brew starts bubbling nicely.This movie was well-acted and well-written -- the plot has a lot going on; the scenery is lovely; the accents are Irish and Robin Wright is very beautiful. I have just two criticisms: I found the music intrusive and too much like a pastiche of what people think Irish tunes should be.

Order is maintained equally by the Catholic Church and the local constabulary represented primarily by a moody officer, Brendan(Albert Finney).  A gloom has fallen over the town, however.  The locals believe a curse is on the town because unmarried seamstress Tara(Robin Wright), who also makes extra quid running supplies to the IRA, has given birth out of wedlock and it won't be lifted until she names the father.  Brendan has made repeated offers of marriage to Tara to make her a decent woman but she will have none of it.  Meanwhile a travelling group of actors called the Playboys has come to town.  What this troupe lacks in polish it has in versatility.  They can do Shakespeare and ""Gone with the Wind"" as well as a mean Can-Can much to the consternation of the parish priest.  Tara becomes smitten with the Playboys affably handsome lead performer, Tom(Aidan Quinn).  This draws the ire of Brendan but will Tara sacrifice the greatest happiness she's ever known?  I think the novelty of ""The Playboys"" is it shows the people of Ireland in a different light.  Most films set in Ireland draw these folks in broad strokes with more than a touch of blarney.  There's a grittiness on display here.  The beauty of the script, co-written by Shane Connaughton who helped write ""My Left Foot"", is that the characters and not the setting take prominence.  Tara and Mike are fully fleshed out individuals and their romance is kinetic.  Also, Brendan could have been played heavy handed but Finney gives the character complexity making him a tragic figure instead of a villain.  ""The Playboys"" is at turns challenging and entertaining.

I saw the film in the theatre several years ago and have been waiting to buy the DVD.  I don't remember the characters names, but the gist of the story is this:  Robin Wright plays a young woman living in a small village in Ireland.  She is the mother of an adorable out-of-wedlock baby.  She will not divulge the identity of the baby's father.  Albert Finney plays the village constable.  He wants to marry Wright, but she refuses to marry him or to identify her child's father.  Many folks in the village feel Wright ought to marry the good cop.One day, a very small traveling carnival arrives in the village. The carnival is so small all the members of the troupe perform multiple tasks.  One of the troupe is played by Aiden Quinn. Quinn has a nifty motorcycle which he spins round and round the village green to impress Wright.  Finney disapproves of Quinn's interest in Wright.  When the carnival leaves the village, Quinn asks Wright to ride aways with him on his motorbike. Will she, should she?  You'll have to watch the film to find out whether she chooses the good cop or the dashing young man, and you will discover the identity of the baby's father by the end of the film.",4,Irish love story.....,990403200,"05 21, 2001",2001,1250,"['PLAYBOYS', 'stars', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Aiden', 'Quinn', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'saw', 'film', 'theatre', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'buy', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'characters', 'names', 'gist', 'story', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'young', 'woman', 'living', 'small', 'village', 'Ireland', 'mother', 'adorable', 'out-of-wedlock', 'baby', 'will', 'not', 'divulge', 'identity', 'baby', 'father', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'village', 'constable', 'marry', 'Wright', 'marry', 'identify', 'child', 'father', 'Many', 'folks', 'village', 'feel', 'Wright', 'ought', 'marry', 'good', 'cop.One', 'day', 'very', 'small', 'traveling', 'carnival', 'arrives', 'village', 'carnival', 'so', 'small', 'members', 'troupe', 'perform', 'multiple', 'tasks', 'One', 'troupe', 'played', 'Aiden', 'Quinn', 'Quinn', 'nifty', 'motorcycle', 'round', 'round', 'village', 'green', 'impress', 'Wright', 'Finney', 'Quinn', 'interest', 'Wright', 'When', 'carnival', 'village', 'Quinn', 'Wright', 'ride', 'aways', 'motorbike', 'Will', 'should', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'good', 'cop', 'dashing', 'young', 'man', 'will', 'discover', 'identity', 'baby', 'father', 'end', 'film']",N/A

This film, ""The Playboys"", is better than all those films, in my opinion.A story about secrets, love, fidelity, irony and small town life, ""The Playboys"" features a stunning performance by Alber Finney and likely the best film work of Aidan Quinn's career as they compete for unwed-but-pregnant Robin Wright, a young woman in a small Irish town that won't disclose the father of her child circa 1957.While the film is not completely convincing in its representation of the 1950s (who knows what rural Ireland was like then?) it nonetheless remains an involving drama about people, circumstances, personal honor and what is important in life. Shane Connaughton's script plays the competition between the two men -- the standup cop Finney, representing good and irony, against actor-playboy Quinn, representing free spirits --against the overall conservatism and situational condemnation of village residents. The result is good fun and enticing cinema verite.Filmed in Ireland, ""The Playboys"" is a wonderful movie that avoids nonsense and sentimentality, ends realistically, and asks the viewer what happenend when it's all over.

316192,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,6302497183,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 2]","""The Playboys,""(1992), is a drama/romance/comedy set in a pretty, provincial Irish village of the 1950's.  The rural landscape of County Cavan is lovely in this film directed by Gillies MacKinnon, who was born in the urban, unlovely town of Glasgow, Scotland.  The clothes, cars and houses look authentic and atmospheric, the dialogue's good, and there's plenty of ""crac,"" that Irish wit.The movie, which is full of faces familiar from other Irish films, concerns one Tara Maguire, played by the American Robin Wright, who's been delivered of a boy child and refuses to identify his father.  (This part was to have been played by Annette Bening, but she turned up pregnant.)  Tara's sister Brigid, played by Niamh Cusack, of the well-known Irish theatrical family, is solidly supportive.  Adrian Dunbar - has a modern Irish movie ever been made without him ?- plays a local farmer who kills himself, possibly over bad luck with his cattle, possibly because of Tara's refusal to marry him.  She's also refusing to marry the older man, the local Constable, Brendan Hegarty, who, we come to learn, actually is the child's father.  As played by an adamantine Albert Finney, he really is the spine of this slow, low-key, soft-focus film.  For although the village priest is calling Tara out from the pulpit, the locals can't be too hard on her: they've known her from her own birth.Into this pregnant situation comes a threadbare traveling troupe of actors, led by Freddie, the marvelously talented Milo O'Shea. Tom Casey, played by the American, handsome blue-eyed Aidan Quinn, is the leading man of their performances.  Performances that are always eccentric, and frequently downright hilarious.  And Tara, who rather unusually for the time and place, insists on marrying for love, sure loves Tom.  Tara is portrayed, possibly also rather unusually for the time and place, as a woman who stubbornly insists on standing on her own, and supporting herself and her child: this she ably does by sewing, and by a spot of comic-relief smuggling across the nearby border of Northern Ireland now and then.  There's also a subplot about the activities of the Irish Republican Activities that never amounts to much.  Despite the fact that a barn is actually burnt down during its course, ""The Playboys""is no barn-burner; but it's a charming, romantic little comedy to curl up with of a chilly evening.",4,"Finney's The Spine of This Slow, Soft-Focus Film",1196294400,"11 29, 2007",2007,2388,"['Playboys', '1992', 'drama/romance/comedy', 'set', 'pretty', 'provincial', 'Irish', 'village', '1950', 'rural', 'landscape', 'County', 'Cavan', 'lovely', 'film', 'directed', 'Gillies', 'MacKinnon', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'urban', 'unlovely', 'town', 'Glasgow', 'Scotland', 'clothes', 'cars', 'houses', 'look', 'authentic', 'atmospheric', 'dialogue', 'good', 'plenty', 'crac', 'Irish', 'wit.The', 'movie', 'full', 'familiar', 'other', 'Irish', 'films', 'concerns', 'one', 'Tara', 'Maguire', 'played', 'American', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'who', 'been', 'delivered', 'boy', 'child', 'identify', 'father', 'part', 'was', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'turned', 'up', 'pregnant', 'Tara', 'sister', 'Brigid', 'played', 'Niamh', 'Cusack', 'well-known', 'Irish', 'theatrical', 'family', 'solidly', 'supportive', 'Adrian', 'Dunbar', 'modern', 'Irish', 'movie', 'ever', 'been', 'made', 'local', 'farmer', 'who', 'possibly', 'bad', 'luck', 'cattle', 'possibly', 'Tara', 'refusal', 'marry', 'also', 'refusing', 'marry', 'older', 'man', 'local', 'Constable', 'Brendan', 'Hegarty', 'who', 'come', 'learn', 'actually', 'child', 'father', 'played', 'adamantine', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'really', 'spine', 'slow', 'low-key', 'soft-focus', 'film', 'village', 'priest', 'calling', 'Tara', 'pulpit', 'locals', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'hard', ""'ve"", 'known', 'own', 'birth.Into', 'pregnant', 'situation', 'threadbare', 'traveling', 'troupe', 'actors', 'led', 'Freddie', 'marvelously', 'talented', 'Milo', ""O'Shea"", 'Tom', 'Casey', 'played', 'American', 'handsome', 'blue-eyed', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'leading', 'man', 'performances', 'Performances', 'are', 'always', 'eccentric', 'frequently', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'Tara', 'who', 'rather', 'unusually', 'time', 'place', 'marrying', 'love', 'sure', 'Tom', 'Tara', 'portrayed', 'possibly', 'also', 'rather', 'unusually', 'time', 'place', 'woman', 'who', 'stubbornly', 'standing', 'own', 'supporting', 'child', 'ably', 'sewing', 'spot', 'comic-relief', 'smuggling', 'nearby', 'border', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'now', 'then', 'also', 'subplot', 'activities', 'Irish', 'Republican', 'Activities', 'never', 'much', 'fact', 'barn', 'actually', 'burnt', 'down', 'course', 'Playboys', 'barn-burner', 'charming', 'romantic', 'little', 'comedy', 'curl', 'up', 'chilly', 'evening']",N/A
