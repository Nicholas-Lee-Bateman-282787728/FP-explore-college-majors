Others here have captured its essence, but as an adult I loved this charming little tale of a neglected and unloved little girl who finds her Prince Charming. The costumes are fascinating, along with a special blend of fantasy elves and witches with the real characters. The trees that come alive in an attempt to harm the peasant boy reminded me of a somewhat similar scene in L. Frank Baum's The Wizard of Oz. This is a classic worth the purchase, although I saw it on Hulu.",5,Perfect holiday movie for the little ones,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,572,"['would', 'make', 'perfect', 'little', 'movie', 'keep', 'little', 'ones', 'entranced', 'holiday', 'time', 'Others', 'here', 'have', 'captured', 'essence', 'adult', 'loved', 'charming', 'little', 'tale', 'neglected', 'unloved', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'costumes', 'are', 'fascinating', 'special', 'blend', 'fantasy', 'elves', 'witches', 'real', 'characters', 'trees', 'come', 'alive', 'attempt', 'harm', 'peasant', 'boy', 'reminded', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'scene', 'L.', 'Frank', 'Baum', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'classic', 'worth', 'purchase', 'saw', 'Hulu']",N/A

Well yes it was really silly, but it was fun to watch!  I couldn't find a time that I was board to tears.""WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS""Once there was a pretty young girl with a father and an evil stepmother and fat, stupid and ugly stepsister.  Her stepmother has no love for the girl, the girl's name is Nastenka.  She can somehow talk to the roosters and make the flowers grow from her tears.  She and her father are forced to do house chours, especially her.Meanwhile in a distant village, there is a very handsome young man named Ivanushka, or Ivan for sort.  Well he's handsome all right, but he's so vain that he holds up a mirror singing about how beautiful he is, how hilarous!  He lets himself get robbed, plays a game with the Mushroom sorcerer, but then when he acts rude to the Mushroom sorcerer, even after he gives him a bow and arrow, the Mushroom sorcerer decides to play a cruel, but good trick on Ivan.Well Ivan is out searching for a wife.  Well this actor that plays him looks to be about in his late twenties while the actoress that plays  Nastenka looks to be about in her teens.  Well then he meets Nastenka, he's taken by her beauty and asks her to marry him, she rejects, and he sees some bears across the stream, and decides to prove he's worth to her by killing the bears.  She gets mad and puts a bucket over his head, and when she takes it off he's a bear.  Well what do you know, it's the curse that the Mushroom sorcerer put on him.  Well Nastenka faints at the sight of him.  Everyone else runs away from him.  And in order to get his handsome self back he has to do some good deeds.Well he does some good deeds and he's back to normal, and he's ready to meet up with Nastenka again!  And a lot of events lead to their meeting, from Baba Yaga to Father Frost.  And I'll end the spoilers here.You'll have to watch the movie for yourself, I'll warn you, it might be a little silly by American standerds, but hey it's a kids movie!  Don't take it too seroiusly!  Watch it and have a good time!  Who knows, maybe you might feel like a kid again!

There's a reason it was included in the Mystery Science Theater lineup, and unsurprisingly it's because what you've got here is a bizarrely staged fairy tale that fails on oh-so-many levels.  The costumes and sets are hokey, the dubbing is atrocious, the effects are ridiculous, and even as budgetary constraints prevented the film from looking as magical as a fairy tale should, the filmmakers apparently decided that they could make up for it with the sort of slapstick that will appeal only to slow children under the age of ten.

Some tech details left off Amazon's page:  languages: Russian, also dubbed English and French; subtitles: Russian, English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Italian, and Japanese. Remixed to Dolby 5.1 (variable quality, sometimes electronically reprossed for stereo, some mono); full screen; 84 minutes; among the extras: an interview with the grown-up lead actress (what a change!).  There are two versions: one with the title MOPO3KO on the cover playable in all regions (my copy), and this one.  The first you can find in Russian stores.  If you're learning Russian, this is probably beyond second year, but you can follow the subtitles.  Very good picture quality.  Totally enjoyable.  Now one of my all-time favorites.

672396,AT7W1EXT0PF2Y,B00005OCKP,The Patriarch,"[19, 19]","I'm really pleased that this is on DVD and that so many other reviewers share my feelings about this film. First of all, this is a fine movie for children to watch, unlike the garbage released today. But for older viewers this movie is all the more amazing. To put it lightly, this is a tripped out tour de force of talking mushrooms, huts on fowls legs, man-bear transformations, and a man with a very bad haircut. The most amazing thing about this film is that something completely bizzare happens in every scene. Example: when the hero finds his future wife(sorry I'm not even going to bother trying to transcribe the names) she is watering a dead tree stump, ""so that it will sprout flowers."" Later when he is turned into a bear(!) the flowers grow and reassure her that he is alright. I wish I could write stuff like this. The special effects are horrible, but would you want it any other way? I would recommend this film to any parent who wants an imaginative and clean film for their child, and those who enjoy classic/obscure/budget cinema.",5,beautiful film,1130457600,"10 28, 2005",2005,1048,"[""'m"", 'really', 'pleased', 'DVD', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'share', 'feelings', 'film', 'First', 'all', 'fine', 'movie', 'children', 'watch', 'garbage', 'released', 'today', 'older', 'viewers', 'movie', 'more', 'amazing', 'put', 'lightly', 'tripped', 'out', 'tour', 'force', 'talking', 'mushrooms', 'huts', 'fowls', 'legs', 'man-bear', 'transformations', 'man', 'very', 'bad', 'haircut', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'film', 'something', 'completely', 'bizzare', 'happens', 'scene', 'Example', 'when', 'hero', 'future', 'wife', 'sorry', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'bother', 'trying', 'transcribe', 'names', 'watering', 'dead', 'tree', 'stump', 'so', 'will', 'sprout', 'flowers', 'Later', 'when', 'turned', 'bear', 'flowers', 'grow', 'reassure', 'alright', 'wish', 'could', 'write', 'stuff', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'horrible', 'would', 'want', 'other', 'way', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'parent', 'who', 'imaginative', 'clean', 'film', 'child', 'who', 'enjoy', 'classic/obscure/budget', 'cinema']",N/A
