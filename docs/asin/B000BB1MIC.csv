No. Gilmore Girls is one of those rare creations on TV or any media really where the characters are so well fleshed out they are real. I can not draw. When I try to draw a human face it ends up looking like a cat drew it or a 2-year old. Most TV is that way. Characters are distorted, lamed-down, absurd imitations of human beings. Quite depressing actually. It is why I read or watch sports.Once in awhile lo and behold REAL PEOPLE on TV. Quirky people. Quirky people who are belivable. The main characters are flawed, intelligent, interesting, amusing, and aware. The quirky supporting cast is just as believable and endearing.This year we get to see Rory dealing with relationships on a deeper more emotional level both with boyfriends and her mom. And there is more Luke and Lorelai together. Good stuff.There has been talk of a Gilmore Girls movie filling in the time since we last have seen them. Also talk of Alexis not wanting to do it. It doesn't matter. Once you get hooked on the series you will know these characters as well as the writers and the actors. And that is some mighty fine writing to achieve that.The Emmys should be ashamed of itself. The series was virtually over-looked except for a 'statue' episode. Almost nothing receiving an Emmy the forst years of the new decade could come close to this. Series is so good I gave it a 5 but it should as a DVD be closer to a 4 or even a 3. Not a lot of extras. Fans deserve more when they shell out money, especially as many have watched the episodes before.But if you want to introduce someone new to them or watch them commerical free whenever you want.

939258,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000BB1MIC,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[16, 19]","It's very safe to say that season five of GG was a startling and smashing return to form. Coming off of the misguided season four, which started off on the wrong foot but ended with a blaze of glory, season five was the kind of season that reminded you why you loved this show, and you were just glad that it was back in glorious form. There were some things that didn't quite gel as the season progressed, but they are minor quibbles. Nothing to detract from a fine season. Why so good?. The show was back to itself. Mother and daughter were more close again, and the show just had that special GG tone back. The writing was back on firmer Gilmore ground, new storylines were fresh, brilliantly done, and for this show and characters, daring. The humor was always there, but it was better and even spicier than in season four. This is the GG I knew and love. The season premiere, ""Say Goodbye To Daisy Miller"", was a brilliant season opener, and if you know who Daisy Miller is, the title makes perfect sense. Basically, Rory slept with married Dean, and that is causing major ripples in their lives. Dean's marriage crumbles, and Rory is in this interesting new state. Meanwhile, Lorelai and Luke are an item, and the episode ""Written In The Stars"", is a magical, sweet, romantic, and sweet tour de force that has the duo going on their first date. Rory meets rich kid Logan Huntberger, and it is the beginning of a new relationship. I didn't like Logan, but events towards the end of the season changed my mind a little. Other great episodes include the series' 100th episode, ""Wedding Bell Blues"", where Richard and Emily re-tie the knot. An amazing episode that begins a strong seperation between Lorelai and Emily. The end of the season finds Rory getting a job at one of Logans' dad's newspapers. But in ""Blame Booze And Mellville"", our little Rory gets disheartening news and reacts in a shocking and un-Rory way. That's what makes it great. The finale, ""A House Is Not A Home"", is a major piece of GG television. It sets up situations that are major in these girls' lives, and carry over into season six. It rivals season four's fantastic finale in a major way. There are plenty of other good to great episodes, but too many to all name here. Not all are great, like ""I Jump, You Jump, Jack"" and ""Norman Mailer I'm Pregnant!"", which does feature the famed author, but there isn't a bad one in the bunch. The writing is top notch and back to fighting form. This was easily one of the show's best seasons ever. The storytelling was rich, and the GG heart, humor, and drama were in full force. This season was one of the most complex and the most rejuvenated. The town of Stars Hollow itself and it's number of looney, but beloved, citizens are just as much a part of the show as anyone else, and I think they got the short shrift in season four. But they are all back and more involved than last year. Lauren Graham continues to shine and is the number one actress who continues to be Emmy-worthy, but never gets the much sought after award. Not even a nomination!. Alexis Bledel as Rory continues to blossom into such a young beauty, and this season has both women in new, different, exciting, and challenging places. Season five of Gilmore Girls is great television.

939261,A169I83JL8QJGN,B000BB1MIC,Daniel A Moir,"[2, 5]","To be honest I only ever heard of Gilmore Girls one time before when the mother and daughter of the series were mocked by the Family Guy and my wife had a quick retort to the show's defense. Then, not a week later, she begged me to buy her this box set for Christmas. In some ways I'm glad I did, and in others I'm kicking myself at the same time for not just buying her Season 1, as I'm still kind of lost at the moment entering a series so late into it's over all drama.In my research, prior to watching season five I learned that this show's premise is supposed to be a mother and daughter who are so close that people mistake them for sisters. Something must have gone horribly wrong along the way because in Season Five I felt that there was a sharp wedge between Lorelei and Rory... a huge sharp wedge. I don't know if that was there all along, or if it's new, but I felt a mother desperately trying to get close to her daughter, only to be pushed away by the 19 year old.To be honest this show was a mixed bag for me, again coming into it so late, though my wife was very excited to receive this Christmas present, and was able to hop right into the set I took longer to get my bearings in the story, and have come to certain conclusions that may not accurately reflect the series as a whole.Firstly, that the show opened up with Rory helping what I later earned is her ex-boyfriend commit adultery didn't exactly put her in a favorable light with me, and said ex-boyfriend, Derek, seemed to have a really sweet, very loving wife who was desperate to please him, and crushed when she learned of his infidelity. This did not put him in a favorable light with me either. Neither character found redemption with me throughout the season, especially with the huge decision that Rory has to make when Preppy boy Logan comes into the picture (who looks freakishly like the guy I sit behind at work I might add...) I did not find a single redeeming quality to Rory, and I came to really detest Derek. I'm not too fond of Rory's grandmother either who is even more shallow and self absorbed than she is!Thankfully, there's Lorelei who is funny, charming, and witty, and (According to my wife) finally with the guy of her dreams and they exhibit some amazing chemistry. I especially enjoyed the episode where the whole town finds out that they are together, and how the town reacts to it, and how they react to their reaction! It was a very funny episode. Lorelei is what made this season so enjoyable for me as she did for Gilmore Girls what Qui Gon Jin did for Star Wars Episode 1, held the show together, and prevented it from becoming un-enjoyable. You see, unlike her daughter and her mother, Lorelei is not shallow, hollow, and self-serving. She's quite the opposite in fact. There were numerous occasions where it was tempting for me to forward through Rory's scenes just to get back to her mother again. She does an excellent job keeping an otherwise stale story afloat, and making it actually entertaining! The show is slower paced, and more character driven, but as long as you don't mind that you'll probably find this series enjoyable.Perhaps the biggest head scratching moment I had was when I read the back of the package and noticed a small add for the series' sound track... The music is used very rarely, and what is there is uninspired. Numerous heavily dramatic moments passed in this season where (especially with Rory) I just wasn't feeling it from the actors, this lack of feeling could have been eliminated with some dramatic score, an acoustic guitar... anything, But in most cases there was nothing. I suppose after 5 season you might have enough licensed material for a single CD, but don't expect much from the show itself.The sound was decent for what it is; plenty loud on its own merits, but lacking any explosions and anything fancy like that it doesn't really need anything big sound wise so it delivers for what it is. The video is light years better than the grainy mess that was American Gothic, but its still not as clean as say 24 (Insert whatever season you choose) and for the sharp trained eye be warned there are frame rate drops which causes the camera movement and the action on the screen to appear somewhat choppy. Its very subtle, and having worked in film editing myself, most likely the result of the way it was filmed (probably digital) rather than the video transfer. This effect is less noticeable on a smaller screen, and isn't as bad as the first couple seasons of Deep Space Nine where any sharp movement of the actors or the camera caused significant choppiness in the presentation, as well as a motion blur. Gilmore Girls Season 5's frame rate dips are nowhere near that bad, but are noticeable on a big screen like mine, and my wife noticed them as well. Again people running this on a smaller TV (Like DS9 before it) may not find it all that noticeable.In all honesty this is not a show I would have been drawn to on my own, but like I said I am glad I got introduced to it. It's one of the WB's better efforts, and although some of the lead characters seem shallow and self-serving they can be pretty true to life. I've lived in small towns, I know people like Lorelei and Rory, for better or worse, and so it's easy to get drawn into the show because of that. My recommendation is that this show is best for fans, or for folks who don't mind slower paced, more character driven shows, and especially for folks who live in smaller rural areas. I'll probably pick up the other seasons gradually myself, as I identify greatly with Luke and my wife, incidentally, has a personality very similar to Lorelei, which makes the show that much more enjoyable for us both. Plus its nice to have a show that we can both agree on, since she usually detests the horror shows I like to watch.",4,A suprisingly decent effort from the WB,1138579200,"01 30,

They share a love for breathless quip-filled conversation and coffee, frequenting Luke's Diner in the downtown of Stars Hollow, their fictitious Connecticut suburb.In Season 1, 16-year-old Rory decides she wants to transfer from the public high school to Chilton, a ritzy private school in Hartford. To make it happen, Lorelai has to make the ultimate sacrifice -- beseech her parents Richard and Emily, with whom she hasn't been on good terms since she announced her teenage pregnancy. Although estranged with Lorelai, the elder Gilmores are more than eager to accept their young granddaughter into their lives. They agree to foot the bill -- on one condition. Both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the elder Gilmores' home every Friday evening.Reluctantly, Lorelai agrees. The resulting Friday night dinners set the stage for much hilarity and snark throughout the seasons -- as well as the occasional glimpse into the Gilmores' sad past, hinting at everything that went wrong in their relationship, well before Rory's birth.Also seen on the show are diner proprietor Luke, a quiet, loyal friend to both mother and daughter with a building crush on Lorelai; Lane, the Korean-American daughter of a stern single mother and Rory's best friend; Sookie, chef at the Independence Inn, which Lorelai manages; Kirk, a quirky ""townie"" who mysteriously shows up everywhere anyone's doing anything; dance instructor and romance expert Miss Patty; and many others. Rory's father Christopher is also around sporadically, as he and Lorelai fight an attraction which has intertwined throughout their lives, but never seems to work out.In this season, Rory embarks on an affair with her ex-boyfriend Dean, who married the past season. Her actions drive her and her mother apart - as well as many fans, who viewed Rory's decisions as completely un-Rorylike. But meanwhile, Rory's also fighting an attraction to rich bad-boy Logan, a fellow member of the Yale newspaper and a mysterious campus secret society. Sookie learns she's pregnant with her second child, Luke's and Lorelai's relationship grows more serious, and the elder Gilmores announce their separation.Although the show is supposedly set in Connecticut, the writers and producers never really make that believable to a native (i.e. Rory and Lorelai walking around with thin coats, wide open, supposedly in the middle of winter. Still, I can overlook that -- it's fun having one of my favorite shows set in my own state.

The season builds-up momentum and really hit's stride when marking it's 100th episode anniversary, (that was a great episode) and I have to agree with many, Lauren Graham deserves Emmy consideration! Nonetheless, many Luke and Lorelai fans will adore this season because the best stuff really comes from them.  Emily is meaner then ever, Paris is just as nuts as she always is and yes, Rory has a new love interest, there's just one problem he doesn't commit well.Honestly the last episode of this season is the best of the series so far.  I can't wait to watch them all over again, because I know there will be something I'll notice that I didn't catch before.If your unsure of investing in the Gilmore Girl sets then watch an episode of season 6 airing now, which is turning out to be, believe it or not, even better then season 5! It's already a shoe in for a 7th season and deserves all the praise it's getting, and all the praise the writers are getting for making us the fans fall in love with these characters all over again. There is no doubt in my mind that this series will eventually end with just as much whit, spunk, charm, warmth, and popularity as it did when it began and when that sad day comes I will have a complete set of one of the most fabulously crafted shows to ever grace our TV sets.

939281,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000BB1MIC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[13, 14]","The fourth season of ""Gilmore Girls"" was my least favorite to date because essentially Lorelia and Rory spent the year treading water.  The finale of the third season, ""Those Are Strings, Pinocchio,"" was when Luke had the dream about Lorelia asking him not to go on the cruise with Nicole, which created a nice bookend with the third season premier, ""Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days,"" when Lorelia had the dream about Luke. Clearly something was being set up for the fourth season, but the payoff was deterred all the way until the final episode, at which point Luke finally kissed Lorelia, Lorelia kissed him back, and then Rory went and lost her virginity to Dean, who happened to be married to Lindsay.  Obviously the series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino is well aware of all those romantic comedies that died as soon as the bickering couples consummated their love (""Moonlighting"" being the paradigmatic example of such a fate).  Still, waiting until the end of the fourth season to have Luke and Lorelai finally kiss was sheer agony.Between the first kisses and the consummation devoutly to be wished, the impediments came from other Gilmores.  ""Goodbye to Daisy Miller"" has Lorelai worried about Rory and Dean, and then learning that her parents are separated.  Fortunately Emily takes Rory to Europe and this actually gives Lorelai and Luke the necessary alone time.  Ultimately ""Gilmore Girls: The Complete Fifth Season"" is about cementing the ties that bind between Luke and Lorelai.  By the end of this season they have become one in every way that matters short of cohabitation and marriage, and are clearly moving in those directions.  All of the best moments in this season have to do with those two, while Rory gets thrown off track by falling into the orbit of Logan Huntsburger and his family.The fifth season has several of my all-time favorite moments in the series to date and two moments when I was a-feared the show was jumping the shark.  My first favorite moment comes in ""Written in the Stars"" when Luke and Lorelai go on their first date, he recalls the first time they met, and shows her what is in his wallet.  Of course he is all in.  Then there is the moment at the end of ""Wedding Bell Blues,"" when Lorelai has learned from Christopher that Emily was encouraging him to rekindle their romance.  As Lorelai was being dragged over for the wedding photography I was yelling at my television for Lorelia to ""nuke"" her mother, by which I meant to pull out the biggest nuclear device in her possession and drop it on Emily, which, I believe is exactly what she does.  There was a close call for another great moment off of this plot line when Rory blows up at her grandmother in ""So...Good Talk,"" but it fell short of my requirements (I want Rory to say to Emily, just once, ""Grandmother, I love you a whole lot, but no matter what you do or what happens I will never love you more than I love my mom"").  My second favorite moment is the end of ""A House is Not a Home,"" and I am talking not only of Lorelia's final question of the season but the whole range of thoughts and emotions that Lorelai goes through right before she pops the question.  Why Lauren Graham does not at least get nominated for an Emmy for Best Actress in a Comedy Series is beyond comprehension (but neither did Sarah Michelle Gellar or any other actress from the WB).My first fears of shark jumping proved to be a false alarm, but in the wake of the wedding debacle I did not buy it when Luke tells Lorelai in ""Say Something"" that they could not be together.  As the town elder points out in ""Blame Booze and Melville,"" Luke has been waiting for Lorelai for a long time and he should be able to weather the perpetual hurricane that is Emily Gilmore.  Fortunately Lorelia's phone call at the end of the episode changes the dynamic (Look at Luke's face: I swear he is ready to take her back right then).  I should point out that my third favorite moment of the season is what accompanies Judy Garland singing ""The Man Who Got Away"" from ""A Star is Born"" at the end of ""So... Good Talk.""However, I had much greater concerns over what happens in ""Blame Booze and Melville"" when Mitchum Huntzberger lowers the boom on Rory and she decides to drop out of Yale.  I personally think that a gopher/intern should keep their mouth shut in meetings of the senior staff at a newspaper.  In the sixth season in ""We've Got Magic to Do"" it is suggested that Mitchum actually believes what he is saying, but I still find it hard to believe.  But the resulting split between Lorelai and Rory is really the province of the sixth season, and while I agree that the dramatic consequences of such a rift was worth pursuing at this point in the series, I simply think that dropping out of Yale and moving in with grandma and grandpa was not the way to go (I waited in vain for Paris to really read Rory the riot act).  But as the nadir of the series plays out against Claudin Longet singing ""I Think It's Going To Rain"" when Rory turns away from her mother, it also serves to set up the beauty of the cliffhanger that was never a cliffhanger.""Wedding Bell Blues"" was the show's 100th episode so it gets special treatment with the DVD extras here.  However, the main thing is that we are now caught up with all five seasons out on DVD during the sixth season of ""Gilmore Girls.""  Let joy be undiminished on theis new year's day.",5,Luke and Lorelai finally get to the devoutly wished consummation,1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,5397,"['fourth', 'season', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'was',

This show used to be a cute, funny ""dramedy"" that managed to stay rooted in reality despite somewhat far-fetched characters and plotlines. Now, it's all over the place. I can understand that characters need to mature over the course of a show, but Rory's personality change is ridiculous. Suddenly, she's no longer a serious academic, but instead wants to drop out of college, break the law, and sleep around. Meanwhile, several promising storylines go nowhere. Dean has returned, yes, but he's now a scruffy jerk. Luke and Lorelai finally get together, yes, but they sleep together after one date, ruining tons of potential. The list goes on and on. Plus, every episode now includes at least 15 minutes of uninterrupted, near-unintelligible, ""funny"" banter and/or diatribes. The plotlines have become ridiculous, in a failed attempt to be satirical. Once I saw the episode where Dean and Luke get into fisticuffs over a freakin' Bop-It, I was done.

939284,A1J6W0GJ9HQTBM,B000BB1MIC,Marinergirl,"[7, 19]","In my opinion, season 5 is when the girls start their not-so-graceful swandive to mediocrity. The emphasis of the show turns to Yale and Richard and Emily and the Huntzbergers so much so that the show is starting to resemble a ""Who's who of upper class Conneticut"" advertisement. Less and less time is spent in Stars Hollow, and former regulars on the show don't get the airtime they deserve. Suki, Jackson, Miss Patty, Babette (what happened to Maury anyway? He's simply disappeared from the show!) and even Taylor are rare sights these days.It's hard to complain about Lorelia's character, on her own she's fabulous. But when paired with Luke? The show has deflated noticably since this unfortunate turn.The same goes for Rory. Once a strong, independent character, she has been reduced to half of the Logan/Rory combination. By making the two women of the show half of a couple takes away from the girl power message the show started out with. They now need men to save them, like Luke loaning Lorelai the money and Logan (in season 6) sweeping in to save the paper just hours before publication.The show was at its peak when it revolved around Stars Hollow. Season five isn't all bad, but it's the beginning of the end. Season 6 has bright spots, but they are few and far between. Who knows what will happen once Amy and Dan Palladino leave after this season?

939287,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B000BB1MIC,MollyRK,"[1, 1]","Okay, maybe I'm being a little critical there. At this point in the show's run, with Rory having one year of college under her belt and witnessing an undeniable rift in the mother/daughter dynamic in Season 4, I think it was important to add more than a twinge of humanity to Rory's character in this pivotal Season 5.Season 4 was clearly not Gilmore Girls' best year, perhaps mostly because the relationship between mother and daughter had to undergo a significant change with the separation caused by Rory's entrance into college. As all avid fans know, Rory maintained her squeaky-clean, sweet little girl next door image throughout that season, right up to the season finale....and then she fell flat on her face with a decision that stunned everyone. In Season 5, we get to bear witness to her reaction to her big mistake (a reaction that you might not expect from her), and she goes back for her second year at Yale as a much more human college kid. She parties more, breaks out of her shell, and truly separates from that sweet and youthful image with a choice in the season finale that, just like the 4th season finale, left all viewers speechless (maybe even more so this time around). Now, of course, in the current Season 6, Rory is most definitely a very different person than she was portrayed as the first four years of the show, and although it is disappointing to many Rory fans, it is a dramatic shift in character that clearly began its unwinding in this Season 5.A renaissance of a year for Rory Gilmore, indeed....but let's not forget Lorelai, either. Not only does she finally get her dream inn, the Dragonfly, underway with a highly successful test run and a booming first year of business, but she gets something else that's pretty major. Indications of the chemistry and concealed love between Luke and Lorelai have been evident to the naked eye since the pilot episode of Season 1, and now we FINALLY get to see this formulate into a romantic relationship. The strength of this season lies arguably in the bond that these two share. It's something that fans have wanted for a very long time, and with the developments occurring in Season 6, it appears that this couple will make for some very high quality television.Season 5 is certainly a season to purchase if you are a big fan of the show. A strong metamorphosis takes place with the characters as they settle into their changes in distance and personal relationships, the show becomes something far different from what we enjoyed in the first few seasons and truly becomes respectable and powerful in its own right.",5,the season with the Rory we wish we never had to meet....,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,2595,"['Okay', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'little', 'critical', 'there', 'point', 'show', 'run', 'Rory', 'having', 'one', 'year', 'college', 'belt', 'witnessing', 'undeniable', 'rift', 'mother/daughter', 'dynamic', 'Season', '4', 'think', 'was', 'important', 'add', 'more', 'twinge', 'humanity', 'Rory', 'character', 'pivotal', 'Season', '5.Season', '4', 'was', 'clearly', 'not', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'best', 'year', 'perhaps', 'mostly', 'relationship', 'mother', 'daughter', 'had', 'undergo', 'significant', 'change', 'separation', 'caused', 'Rory', 'entrance', 'college', 'avid', 'fans', 'know', 'Rory', 'maintained', 'squeaky-clean', 'sweet', 'little', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'image', 'season', 'right', 'up', 'season', 'finale', '.and', 'then', 'fell', 'flat', 'face', 'decision', 'stunned', 'everyone', 'Season', '5', 'get', 'bear', 'witness', 'reaction', 'big', 'mistake', 'reaction', 'might', 'not', 'expect', 'back', 'second', 'year', 'Yale', 'much', 'more', 'human', 'college', 'kid', 'parties', 'more', 'shell', 'truly', 'separates', 'sweet', 'youthful', 'image', 'choice', 'season', 'finale', 'just', '4th', 'season', 'finale', 'left', 'viewers', 'speechless', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'time', 'around', 'Now', 'course', 'current', 'Season', '6', 'Rory', 'most', 'definitely', 'very', 'different', 'person', 'was', 'portrayed', 'first', 'four', 'years', 'show', 'disappointing', 'many', 'Rory', 'fans', 'dramatic', 'shift', 'character', 'clearly', 'began', 'unwinding', 'Season', '5.A', 'renaissance', 'year', 'Rory', 'Gilmore', 'indeed', '.but', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Lorelai', 'either', 'Not', 'only', 'finally', 'get', 'dream', 'inn', 'Dragonfly', 'underway', 'highly', 'successful', 'test', 'run', 'booming', 'first', 'year', 'business', 'something', 'else', 'pretty', 'major', 'Indications', 'chemistry', 'concealed', 'love', 'Luke', 'Lorelai', 'have', 'been', 'evident', 'naked', 'eye', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Season', '1', 'now', 'FINALLY', 'get', 'see', 'formulate', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'strength', 'season', 'arguably', 'bond', 'two', 'share', 'something', 'fans', 'have', 'wanted', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'developments', 'occurring', 'Season', '6', 'couple', 'will', 'make', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'television.Season', '5', 'certainly', 'season', 'purchase', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'strong', 'metamorphosis', 'place', 'characters', 'settle', 'changes', 'distance', 'personal', 'relationships', 'show', 'something', 'far', 'different', 'what', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'truly', 'becomes', 'respectable', 'powerful', 'own', 'right']",Gilmore Girls: Season 5

Rory found her place at Yale, Paris was MUCH less of an annoying roommate than she could have been, and everything in Stars Hollow seemed to be clicking.  This season was just 22 episodes of fun mixed with some excellently written drama.  I don't really believe there is much else to say about this season.  The romance between Lorelai and Luke has been so long in the making that it is finally a huge breath of fresh air to see it come to fruition.  After their little falling out 1/2 through the season, seeing Luke at her door and the two of them kiss made all my roommates and I jump off our couches and scream, ""YYEEESSSS!""  Which may not be that weird to some people, but we are all heterosexual heavy metal loving males.  Why do I mention this?  Because the Gilmore girls works on a level that is attractive to everyone.  Whether you're a middle aged woman, a college aged girl, or a pierced up 20 something male, the Gilmore girls is a fabulously well written and very entertaining show.The thing I loved most about season 5 is the speed with which the characters quip back and forth to each other.

939293,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B000BB1MIC,P Magnum,"[147, 154]","Gilmore Girls is one of those rare shows that has maintained a consistently high standard of quality throughout its run and has even managed to get better with age.  The show started with the Lorelei (Lauren Graham) & Rory (Alexis Bledel) as mother & daughter who are best friends.  Rory was an innocent intellectual who was starting a prestigious high school as sophomore.  Through the years, the show has transformed her from a young girl who lost herself in books and education to a young woman who is experiencing life first-hand.  The change started at the end of season four when Rory sleeps with her ex-boyfriend, the married Dean (Jared Padalecki) and continues in this season with her relationship with the rich Logan Huntzberger (Matt Czuchry).  The change in Rory is startling and Lorelei has a tough time dealing with it thus creating rift between the two.  This season also shows the blossoming of her relationship with Luke (Scott Patterson) and how that relationship is handled by her parents Emily (Kelly Bishop) and Richard (Edward Hermann).  One particular funny episode involves Richard taking Luke golfing.  The best episodes of the season involve Richard & Emily's wedding to renew their vows and the fall-out from Emily's visit to Rory's father Christopher (David Sutcliffe) who shows up at the wedding and gets into a verbal fight with Luke.  The season ends with Rory and Logan stealing a yacht and Rory decides to drop out of Yale.  Lorelei goes to her parents for help in this matter and they agree Rory shouldn't drop out.  They provide the cruelest slap of all in Lorelei's face when they renege on their promise and Rory ends up moving into the pool house.  Ms. Graham is particular superb in this season and fact she was snubbed for an Emmy nomination is criminal.

It finally happens, but not without struggle and heartbreak.  This season is also a little controversial because Rory begins her downward spiral which only ends(?) with her bottoming out in season 6.  My favorite episode is probably ""Wrtten in the Stars"", a lovely, deceptively sweet show when Luke ardently proclaims his love and Lorelai is subtly equivocal, thus setting up the smash-up in the middle of the season.  Other soon to be legendary episodes are ""Wedding Bell Blues"", the 100th episode, when Emily and Christopher nearly succeed in destroying Luke and Lorelai; ""Pulp Friction"", the real reconciliation episode; and of course the season finale ""A House is Not a Home"", where Rory finally loses it after a mind screw-over courtesy of the Huntzberger family. (I wonder; is that supposed to remind us of the Sulzbergers of the ""New York Times""?  What did that newspaper ever do to Amy Sherman-Palladino, hmm?)  This is just a classic TV series, and I shouldn't have to remind men that it features two very hot actresses; winsome Alexis Bledel, and the staggeringly charismatic Lauren Graham.

Mostly, because I really loathed the direction the writers took with Rory, the boring Luke/Lorelai pairing and Ritchie Rich, um, er.. Logan character. The only bright points in this season was the development of Lane, the ending of the relationship between Paris and that creepy professor, and the dragonfly inn.First my peeves: I found Rory incredibly obnoxious this season. She started off as such a wholesome, nice girl, but has slowly become an obnoxious rich brat. Her treatment of her Grandmother, her insensitivity to Dean, and the the way she behaves  is just rude and callous. I really expected more from her. Plus, what I like about this series is the small town atmosphere. The richer than God friends Rory has been hanging out with make me feel like I'm watching Dynasty.Lorelai has regressed to about 13. Since when does Lorealai need protection by her daughter? The Luke/Lorelai pairing bored me. I just don't see any chemistry there. Luke's treatment of Dean was obnoxious. I found it difficult to believe that Lorelai and Rory wouldn't have some issue with that. Okay, so they give their own mother the cold shoulder for playing matchmaker and don't get annoyed with Luke for trying to engineer Rory's relationship....Okay.The girls were hypocritical and irritating this season.

For me Lorelei's best match was Max.  It was a pleasure seeing them together.  Luke belongs in the ""best friend category"" and as a good contrast to Lorelei's sunny disposition.  I found their scenes together forced and did not enjoy watching them together.I got tired of so many scenes by Doose, Kirk and all the silly characters which were funny before but now have been pushed to an extreme on the silly meter.The actress who plays Sookie, who is usually superb was, awful during the election of her husband to town's rep.  She looks like she's acting.....Completely unbelievable that Lane and Zach got together, especially knowing they marry them off in Season 6.  Ridiculous!!!!The positive this season?  LOGAN.  He was a pleasure to watch, and the mix between his good and ""bad"" sides were perfect.  I enjoyed all the scenes between him and Rory.  The screen lit up everytime he was on.  I am glad to see he continues to be very present in season 6.  BUT PLEASE, need to improve the kissing scenes between Logan and Rory.  We're not watching a 1930's movie!!!!.  Go back and watch Rory and Jess kissing, and then have Rory and Logan do the same.Rory's character had the most changes.  It was good to see her making some bad decisions as she was just too perfect to be true.  But I don't think the actress was up to the needed performance.  I have a hard time accepting her as a 19-year old.  Also,PLEASE do something about her wardrobe and hair.  She looks 14 most of the time.So, in conclusion, maybe it's time for me to say good-bye to the Gilmore girls....In any case, if I keep watching it will be for Lauren Graham, who has been a wonderful and consistent Lorelei, for Logan and Rory together (I think the writers can help the actress who plays Rory to evolve in her role),  and that's about it.",3,"Gilmore is LESS, this season.",1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,2427,"['realized', 'quality', 'show', 'had', 'greatly', 'diminished', 'fact', 'found', 'fast-forwarding', 'repeatedly', 'last', '3', 'dvd', 'season.I', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'Season', '5', 'looked', 'up', 'show', 'Episode', 'Guide', 'read', 'Season', '6', 'synopses', 'determine', 'buy', 'when', 'out.While', 'Lorelei', 'be', 'strong', 'character', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'shine', 'portraying', 'found', 'plot', 'lines', 'be', 'dull', 'forced', 'plain', 'everyone', 'else', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Luke', 'Lorelei', 'together', 'Lorelei', 'best', 'match', 'was', 'Max', 'was', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'together', 'Luke', 'best', 'friend', 'category', 'good', 'contrast', 'Lorelei', 'sunny', 'disposition', 'found', 'scenes', 'together', 'forced', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'together.I', 'got', 'tired', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'Doose', 'Kirk', 'silly', 'characters', 'were', 'funny', 'now', 'have', 'been', 'pushed', 'extreme', 'silly', 'meter.The', 'actress', 'who', 'Sookie', 'who', 'usually', 'superb', 'was', 'awful', 'election', 'husband', 'town', 'rep.', 'acting', '..Completely', 'unbelievable', 'Lane', 'Zach', 'got', 'together', 'especially', 'knowing', 'marry', 'off', 'Season', '6', 'Ridiculous', 'positive', 'season', 'LOGAN', 'was', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'mix', 'good', 'bad', 'sides', 'were', 'perfect', 'enjoyed', 'scenes', 'Rory', 'screen', 'lit', 'up', 'everytime', 'was', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'be', 'very', 'present', 'season', '6', 'BUT', 'PLEASE', 'need', 'improve', 'kissing', 'scenes', 'Logan', 'Rory', ""'re"", 'not', 'watching', '1930', 'movie', 'Go', 'back', 'watch', 'Rory', 'Jess', 'kissing', 'then', 'have', 'Rory', 'Logan', 'do', 'same.Rory', 'character', 'had', 'most', 'changes', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'making', 'bad', 'decisions', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'perfect', 'be', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'actress', 'was', 'up', 'needed', 'performance', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'accepting', '19-year', 'old', 'Also', 'PLEASE', 'do', 'something', 'wardrobe', 'hair', '14', 'most', 'time.So', 'conclusion', 'maybe', 'time', 'say', 'good-bye', 'Gilmore', 'girls', 'case', 'keep', 'watching', 'will', 'be', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'who', 'been', 'wonderful', 'consistent', 'Lorelei', 'Logan', 'Rory', 'together', 'think', 'writers', 'can', 'help', 'actress', 'who', 'Rory', 'evolve', 'role']",Gilmore Girls: Season 5

Luke and Lorelai's relationship grows from strength to strength, with some major hiccups in between, no thanks to the interference of Emily Gilmore [Kelly Bishop] and Christopher.The last two episodes of this season truly keeps you riveted as a dejected Rory turns to a desperate act that lands her not only in trouble with the law but also causes a rift between her and her mother, Lorelai.The writing is as good as ever and the acting superb.
