It is short and doesn't contain any new proof of finding, or even locating Atlantis. There are many of these books featuring different locations from the Antarctic to the Adriatic. As I said, it's not a bad read, more like an introduction to a longer, more detailed work. It still wasn't bad for the very low price.",3,Only So-so,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,391,"['Atlantis', 'Secret', 'Star', 'Mappers', 'Lost', 'World', 'OK', 'considering', 'price', 'short', ""n't"", 'contain', 'new', 'proof', 'finding', 'even', 'locating', 'Atlantis', 'are', 'many', 'books', 'featuring', 'different', 'locations', 'Antarctic', 'Adriatic', 'said', 'not', 'bad', 'read', 'more', 'introduction', 'longer', 'more', 'detailed', 'work', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'very', 'low', 'price']",N/A
