My Panasonic wouldn't but my Philips would play it.Before things got so PC the use of the palmer girls was a reflection of the age. The Power Station videos and audio are exceptional as are ""Addicted To Love"" and ""Simply Irresistible"". I discovered his vocal power in Dada and Vinegar Joe. His love affair with Jamaica and reggae seems quaint compared to the polished silk tie of his later years. He's sorely missed but the videos carry his ghost well. Highly recommended.As I Am",4,PAL all regions DVD,1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,580,"['Very', 'good', 'collection', 'Palmer', 'videos', 'enjoyed', 'commentary', 'Surprised', 'was', 'not', 'listed', 'PAL', 'Panasonic', 'would', ""n't"", 'Philips', 'would', 'play', 'it.Before', 'things', 'got', 'so', 'PC', 'use', 'palmer', 'girls', 'was', 'reflection', 'age', 'Power', 'Station', 'videos', 'audio', 'are', 'exceptional', 'are', 'Addicted', 'Love', 'Simply', 'Irresistible', 'discovered', 'vocal', 'power', 'Dada', 'Vinegar', 'Joe', 'love', 'affair', 'Jamaica', 'reggae', 'quaint', 'compared', 'polished', 'silk', 'tie', 'later', 'years', 'sorely', 'missed', 'videos', 'carry', 'ghost', 'well', 'Highly', 'recommended.As', 'Am']",Addictions

I was able to purchase it new for $8.38.  It is a great DVD and I am glad that I purchased it, but there are several problems with it.1.  The Amazon description of the DVD says it is a Region 1 format.  It is actually  a PAL/All Regions format.  It would not play on my newer Sony DVD player, but will play on my 5+ year old Emerson DVD player.2.  Robert Palmer's voice is out of sync with the video.  It looks like an old foreign movie where the dialog doesn't match the movements of the mouth.3.  No chapter stops.  You can't go directly to a particular video/song.It would be nice if the manufacturer would remaster this DVD and place Robert Palmer's commentaries between the videos rather than over the videos.  Also, chapter stops for easier access to favorite videos would be helpful.",3,Great Video Collection in spite of problems,1259971200,"12 5, 2009",2009,893,"['DVD', 'collection', 'Robert', 'Palmers', 'videos', 'available', 'again', 'thru', 'several', 'suppliers', 'Amazon.com', 'was', 'able', 'purchase', 'new', '8.38', 'great', 'DVD', 'am', 'glad', 'purchased', 'are', 'several', 'problems', 'it.1', 'Amazon', 'description', 'DVD', 'Region', '1', 'format', 'actually', 'PAL/All', 'Regions', 'format', 'would', 'not', 'play', 'newer', 'Sony', 'DVD', 'player', 'will', 'play', '5+', 'year', 'old', 'Emerson', 'DVD', 'player.2', 'Robert', 'Palmer', 'voice', 'sync', 'video', 'old', 'foreign', 'movie', 'where', 'dialog', ""n't"", 'match', 'movements', 'mouth.3', 'chapter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'directly', 'particular', 'video/song.It', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'manufacturer', 'would', 'remaster', 'DVD', 'place', 'Robert', 'Palmer', 'commentaries', 'videos', 'rather', 'videos', 'Also', 'chapter', 'stops', 'easier', 'access', 'favorite', 'videos', 'would', 'be', 'helpful']",Addictions

784213,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,B0000UM080,William,"[2, 3]","The Robert Palmer DVD Collection contains about 15 clips covering the early days through to most of the later hits. Missing are videos for 'I'll be Your Baby Tonight"" and ""She Makes my Day"" but this may be because they were not filmed.As other reviewers have pointed out, this collection is nothing more than the old video collection which was released at the time of ""Addictions"" in 1992. I also agree with others about the use of Palmer's voice over for alot of the song's introductions. This is particularly poorly done for the ""Johnny and Mary"" video where he talks through the entire song intro and stops just as the first verse is beginning. BAsed on what Palmer says before ""Looking for Clues"" video, it seems he did not like ""Johnny and Mary"" anymore. Another observation is that the video for ""Bad Case of Loving You"" has been replaced with the 1992 remixed version dubbed over the film.  Hard to understand why he chose to remix this song.So there are a few shortfalls with this DVD. However, considering it contains the majority of his hits and that Robert is no longer with us, the voice overs are forgiveable. In a sense, it is a tribute to Palmer and a good record of what he thought of his songs.Can be picked up for a good price so worth getting.",3,Pity about voice overs,1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,1262,"['Robert', 'Palmer', 'DVD', 'Collection', '15', 'clips', 'covering', 'early', 'days', 'most', 'later', 'hits', 'Missing', 'are', 'videos', ""'ll"", 'be', 'Baby', 'Tonight', 'Makes', 'Day', 'may', 'be', 'were', 'not', 'filmed.As', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'collection', 'nothing', 'more', 'old', 'video', 'collection', 'was', 'released', 'time', 'Addictions', '1992', 'also', 'agree', 'others', 'use', 'Palmer', 'voice', 'alot', 'song', 'introductions', 'particularly', 'poorly', 'done', 'Johnny', 'Mary', 'video', 'where', 'entire', 'song', 'intro', 'just', 'first', 'verse', 'beginning', 'BAsed', 'what', 'Palmer', 'Looking', 'Clues', 'video', 'did', 'not', 'Johnny', 'Mary', 'anymore', 'observation', 'video', 'Bad', 'Case', 'Loving', 'been', 'replaced', '1992', 'remixed', 'version', 'dubbed', 'film', 'Hard', 'understand', 'why', 'chose', 'remix', 'song.So', 'are', 'few', 'shortfalls', 'DVD', 'However', 'considering', 'majority', 'hits', 'Robert', 'longer', 'voice', 'overs', 'are', 'forgiveable', 'sense', 'tribute', 'Palmer', 'good', 'record', 'what', 'thought', 'songs.Can', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'good', 'price', 'so', 'worth', 'getting']",Addictions
