375070,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6303450849,Acute Observer,"[2, 6]","Decades ago children were entertained and educated by traditional stories (called Fairy Tales) which ended with some moral lesson. Many of them were so gruesome as to be censored or changed for 20th century tastes. Their rationale was to warn children about an evil world and its dangers. It was not a colorful cartoon where a cat played with mice or a fox with hens. Most of all they taught children the importance of obeying their parents and not advertisers on TV.This film begins with a teenage boy running through the woods. Will he shoot a hare with his slingshot? [This is false, a .22 rifle or a 20 gauge shotgun is more likely.] What about that stray dog? Angus learns to drive a truck but doesn't brake in time. The new yellow dog provides some comedy. [The brown grass suggests California.] Can they afford a dog? [Do people in rural areas need a dog license?] John McCormick pilots his small boat to deliver goods to a customer. Is the boat too small for that big ocean? A huge wave hits the boat and overturns it. Rescue aircraft save the father, but Angus is lost. The son and the yellow dog survive in a small boat to land on the rugged shore. They hunt for fish and clams for food. After a few days Angus decides to walk south to the light house; but they can't. It is cold and rainy. Are there wild animals? Can they trap small animals for food. Biscuits for bait? [No wild berries for food?]Can Angus find a path to the south? The searchers find the boat, Angus would be rescued if he remained where he landed! [Would those searchers travel unarmed in the wilderness?] More days pass for Angus and his Labrador. Will they find food? [Angus appears well fed.] Finally the searchers find their man. ""They found him"" is the message, the tone says good news. A helicopter lifts Angus to safety, the yellow dog falls to the water below. [Was any animal harmed in this film?] The search ends because of the budget. Will the yellow dog eventually return for a happy ending?This entertaining story tells about life in the Pacific Northwest wilderness. The moral is: if you are ever lost stay in one place to increase your chance of being found. A smoky fire would have helped. [Do you know how to start a fire if you don't have a match?]",3,A Modern Traditional Story,1246924800,"07 7, 2009",2009,2247,"['Decades', 'ago', 'children', 'were', 'entertained', 'educated', 'traditional', 'stories', 'called', 'Fairy', 'Tales', 'ended', 'moral', 'lesson', 'Many', 'were', 'so', 'gruesome', 'be', 'censored', 'changed', '20th', 'century', 'tastes', 'rationale', 'was', 'warn', 'children', 'evil', 'world', 'dangers', 'was', 'not', 'colorful', 'cartoon', 'where', 'cat', 'played', 'mice', 'fox', 'hens', 'Most', 'taught', 'children', 'importance', 'obeying', 'parents', 'not', 'advertisers', 'TV.This', 'film', 'teenage', 'boy', 'running', 'woods', 'Will', 'shoot', 'hare', 'slingshot', '[', 'false', '.22', 'rifle', '20', 'gauge', 'shotgun', 'more', 'likely', ']', 'What', 'stray', 'dog', 'Angus', 'drive', 'truck', ""n't"", 'brake', 'time', 'new', 'yellow', 'dog', 'comedy', '[', 'brown', 'grass', 'California', ']', 'Can', 'afford', 'dog', '[', 'Do', 'people', 'rural', 'areas', 'need', 'dog', 'license', ']', 'John', 'McCormick', 'pilots', 'small', 'boat', 'deliver', 'goods', 'customer', 'boat', 'too', 'small', 'big', 'ocean', 'huge', 'wave', 'boat', 'Rescue', 'aircraft', 'save', 'father', 'Angus', 'lost', 'son', 'yellow', 'dog', 'survive', 'small', 'boat', 'land', 'rugged', 'shore', 'hunt', 'fish', 'clams', 'food', 'few', 'days', 'Angus', 'walk', 'south', 'light', 'house', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cold', 'rainy', 'Are', 'there', 'wild', 'animals', 'Can', 'trap', 'small', 'animals', 'food', 'Biscuits', 'bait', 'wild', 'berries', 'food', ']', 'Can', 'Angus', 'find', 'path', 'south', 'searchers', 'find', 'boat', 'Angus', 'would', 'be', 'rescued', 'remained', 'where', 'landed', '[', 'Would', 'searchers', 'travel', 'unarmed', 'wilderness', ']', 'More', 'days', 'pass', 'Angus', 'Labrador', 'Will', 'find', 'food', '[', 'Angus', 'well', 'fed', 'Finally', 'searchers', 'find', 'man', 'found', 'message', 'tone', 'good', 'news', 'helicopter', 'lifts', 'Angus', 'safety', 'yellow', 'dog', 'water', '[', 'Was', 'animal', 'harmed', 'film', ']', 'search', 'budget', 'Will', 'yellow', 'dog', 'eventually', 'return', 'happy', 'ending', 'entertaining', 'story', 'tells', 'life', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'wilderness', 'moral', 'are', 'ever', 'lost', 'stay', 'one', 'place', 'increase', 'chance', 'being', 'found', 'smoky', 'fire', 'would', 'have', 'helped', '[', 'Do', 'know', 'how', 'start', 'fire', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'match', ']']",Far From Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog VHS
375071,A2582KMXLK2P06,6303450849,B. E Jackson,"[0, 2]","I'm sorry to be such a Scrooge with Christmas rapidly approaching, but while watching Far From Home- The Adventures of Yellow Dog tonight, it sort of struck me as boring.  I was expecting a family-oriented film that focuses on a teenager and his dog struggling to make it after a terrible boat accident leaves them stranded along the rocky coasts of British Columbia, and the film delivers in that respect but... it just *barely* delivers.The entire presentation feels really bloated and exaggerated to me which is typical of early to mid 90's adventure films.  A film that certainly LOOKS really good and I imagine a lot of time was devoted to making it, and I remember back in the mid 90's how these type of animal movies won the hearts of everyone who had an affection for them, but as the years pass and technology and filmmaking changes, I find a movie like this just isn't very fun to watch anymore.I can't remember if this film was produce by Disney but it definitely *feels* like it was.  My biggest problem is that the actual survival story between the teenager and his dog was incredibly shallow.Yes they collect bugs, kill animals when they get hungry enough, encounter dangerous wildlife animals such as wolves and wild cats, but... it's just not enough.  These segments feel undeveloped and uncreative.  It's just not enough entertainment and doesn't offer a darn thing as far as originality is concerned either.  It's completely missing anything TRULY enticing.Yes, the parents are worried that their teenage boy is missing.  Interesting though that it never seemed to cross the mind of either those searching for the boy or his parents (with the exception of one scene) that he might be dead.  It was also strange how it was just assumed the boy would make it on land.  I'd be flying planes over the ocean first.If that was MY son out there missing in the woods, you better believe I'd fear the worst.  Granted, there was one really good emotional segment where the father looks into a mirror and cries his eyes out while his wife comforts him, but eh... that was just one moment of sincerity surrounded by a subtle belief that the boys life was never *truly* in danger.  Not very appealing or accurate storytelling.The fact the film is barely 75 minutes long is another problem, and even though everyone loves the dramatic and touching ending, I've seen better.  Actually had the entire movie been dramatic and memorable like the ending, it would have been even better.Personally I feel Homeward Bound is a LOT better because that movie utilizes not just a compelling story of animal survival, but humor as well.  A much better movie than this one.",3,uh oh,1323043200,"12 5, 2011",2011,2664,"[""'m"", 'sorry', 'be', 'such', 'Scrooge', 'Christmas', 'rapidly', 'approaching', 'watching', 'Far', 'Home-', 'Adventures', 'Yellow', 'Dog', 'tonight', 'sort', 'struck', 'boring', 'was', 'expecting', 'family-oriented', 'film', 'teenager', 'dog', 'struggling', 'make', 'terrible', 'boat', 'accident', 'stranded', 'rocky', 'coasts', 'British', 'Columbia', 'film', 'delivers', 'respect', 'just', '*barely*', 'delivers.The', 'entire', 'presentation', 'feels', 'really', 'bloated', 'exaggerated', 'typical', 'early', 'mid', '90', 'adventure', 'films', 'film', 'certainly', 'LOOKS', 'really', 'good', 'imagine', 'lot', 'time', 'was', 'devoted', 'making', 'remember', 'back', 'mid', '90', 'how', 'type', 'animal', 'movies', 'won', 'hearts', 'everyone', 'who', 'had', 'affection', 'years', 'pass', 'technology', 'filmmaking', 'changes', 'find', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'very', 'fun', 'watch', 'anymore.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'film', 'was', 'produce', 'Disney', 'definitely', 'was', 'biggest', 'problem', 'actual', 'survival', 'story', 'teenager', 'dog', 'was', 'incredibly', 'shallow.Yes', 'collect', 'bugs', 'kill', 'animals', 'when', 'get', 'hungry', 'enough', 'encounter', 'dangerous', 'wildlife', 'animals', 'such', 'wolves', 'wild', 'cats', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'segments', 'feel', 'undeveloped', 'uncreative', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'entertainment', ""n't"", 'offer', 'darn', 'thing', 'as', 'far', 'originality', 'concerned', 'either', 'completely', 'missing', 'anything', 'TRULY', 'enticing.Yes', 'parents', 'are', 'worried', 'teenage', 'boy', 'missing', 'Interesting', 'never', 'seemed', 'cross', 'mind', 'searching', 'boy', 'parents', 'exception', 'one', 'scene', 'might', 'be', 'dead', 'was', 'also', 'strange', 'how', 'was', 'just', 'assumed', 'boy', 'would', 'make', 'land', ""'d"", 'be', 'flying', 'planes', 'ocean', 'first.If', 'was', 'MY', 'son', 'there', 'missing', 'woods', 'better', 'believe', ""'d"", 'fear', 'worst', 'Granted', 'was', 'one', 'really', 'good', 'emotional', 'segment', 'where', 'father', 'mirror', 'eyes', 'out', 'wife', 'eh', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'moment', 'sincerity', 'surrounded', 'subtle', 'belief', 'boys', 'life', 'was', 'never', '*truly*', 'danger', 'Not', 'very', 'appealing', 'accurate', 'storytelling.The', 'fact', 'film', 'barely', '75', 'minutes', 'long', 'problem', 'even', 'everyone', 'dramatic', 'touching', 'ending', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'Actually', 'had', 'entire', 'movie', 'been', 'dramatic', 'memorable', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better.Personally', 'feel', 'Homeward', 'Bound', 'LOT', 'better', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'compelling', 'story', 'animal', 'survival', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'one']",Far From Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog VHS

Unfortunately I didn't find it quite as satisfying at most of the reviewers.  Can't quite put my finger on it, but perhaps I didn't find the characters as likeable or convincing as some who saw this.  Even the dog was not that interesting for some reason; perhaps not one of the more attractive breeds.  Also it seemed that they didn't spend enough time developing the bond between the boy and the dog. (The movie is short; not even 1 1/2 hours.) It's a great family movie and I think it is more suitable for young children than older ones who may find it boring.  The younger ones might be a little upset near the end when the dog can't be rescued, but don't worry as it has a happy ending.  It's an okay movie, but I expected a lot more.  I like movies that BOTH kids and adults can enjoy (like Shrek II).  This is definately one mainly just for the kids.  So many things that kids can't or shouldn't watch.  This is one that anyone can watch, which is a big plus.

375081,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,6303450849,Godly Gadfly,"[21, 22]","The cover of our DVD of ""Far From Home"" says in large letters: ""Family Feature"".  And a great family movie it is.  But don't make the mistake of thinking that this is just another dog movie, in this case the adventures of a Labrador named ""Yellow"".  Even more it is about the adventures of his young master Angus.  Angus acquires Yellow when the dog appears on the family property, apparently lost, and soon the boy and his dog become firm friends.  When Angus and Yellow are marooned in wilderness country after the sinking of his father's ship, it is their combined strength that is required to survive the rugged coastline, vast forests, and hostile wildlife.Most of the conflict revolves around this very real struggle against the elements, leading up to a suspenseful and heartwarming conclusion.  But along with this suspense comes excellent and convincing characterization.  More than just an adventure story, ""Far From Home"" is ultimately a coming-of-age story, as Angus learns about responsibility and survival.  In the process, his relationships with his father and with his dog are especially well-portrayed.Although the movie is ""clean"", I would not recommend this movie for younger children under 10 mainly because of its capacity to evoke strong emotions of fear (there are some scary moments involving a sinking ship during a storm, a wolf attack, and a perilous log crossing over a ravine) and grief (it's hard to hold back the emotions experienced at losing a missing child).  But with this depth of emotion, older children and adults alike will find it a real tear-jerker.  When combined with good acting and some lovely cinematography of beautiful rugged British Columbia, this movie is definitely a drama worth keeping for the family. - GODLY GADFLY",5,Spectacular and suspenseful family film!,1092441600,"08 14, 2004",2004,1769,"['cover', 'DVD', 'Far', 'From', 'Home', 'large', 'letters', 'Family', 'Feature', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake', 'thinking', 'just', 'dog', 'movie', 'case', 'adventures', 'Labrador', 'named', 'Yellow', 'Even', 'more', 'adventures', 'young', 'master', 'Angus', 'Angus', 'Yellow', 'when', 'dog', 'family', 'property', 'apparently', 'lost', 'soon', 'boy', 'dog', 'become', 'firm', 'When', 'Angus', 'Yellow', 'are', 'marooned', 'wilderness', 'country', 'sinking', 'father', 'ship', 'combined', 'strength', 'required', 'survive', 'rugged', 'coastline', 'vast', 'forests', 'hostile', 'wildlife.Most', 'conflict', 'very', 'real', 'struggle', 'elements', 'leading', 'up', 'suspenseful', 'heartwarming', 'conclusion', 'suspense', 'excellent', 'convincing', 'characterization', 'More', 'just', 'adventure', 'story', 'Far', 'From', 'Home', 'ultimately', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'Angus', 'responsibility', 'survival', 'process', 'relationships', 'father', 'dog', 'are', 'especially', 'movie', 'clean', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'younger', 'children', '10', 'mainly', 'capacity', 'evoke', 'strong', 'emotions', 'fear', 'are', 'scary', 'moments', 'involving', 'sinking', 'ship', 'storm', 'wolf', 'attack', 'perilous', 'log', 'crossing', 'ravine', 'grief', 'hard', 'hold', 'back', 'emotions', 'experienced', 'losing', 'missing', 'child', 'depth', 'emotion', 'older', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'will', 'find', 'real', 'tear-jerker', 'When', 'combined', 'good', 'acting', 'lovely', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'rugged', 'British', 'Columbia', 'movie', 'definitely', 'drama', 'worth', 'keeping', 'family', 'GODLY', 'GADFLY']",Far From Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog VHS

He's just finishing up a nice canoe.  And when he finds a stray dog, he adopts him and names him Yellow.Taking a few days off from school to accompany his dad, John (Bruce Davison), on a supply run seems like a dream come true.  But when they encounter a fierce storm, the boat they are in capsizes.  John is quickly rescued, but the search and rescue teams can't find any trace of Angus or Yellow.The two have survives and are trying to find their way back to civilization.  Will they be able to survive and be reunited with their family?This movie is fairly standard and innocuous family fare.  It is a little slow at times, especially in the beginning while things are set up.  It is fairly predictable.  But it is entertaining.  Kids will enjoy it more than their parents.  My biggest complaint was actually the short scenes.  Many things are introduced and resolved too quickly, never giving any plot point time to be fully developed.  At the same time, I did eventually get caught up in the emotions and found the ending satisfying.The film could have been much better but does grow on you.

375088,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,6303450849,Michael Butts,"[5, 5]","Young Jesse Bradford gives a heartwarming performance as Angus, a young lad who adopts a labrador and names it Yellow Dog.  On a sailing trip with father Bruce Davison (effective in a non-typical role), he and the dog are thrown overboard and faced with surviving in uncharted Pacific Northwest.  Mimi Rogers plays Angus' mother, and the parents' dedication in believing their son is still alive is touching as well.  Although the movie doesn't give us a lot of ""adventures"" with the boy and his dog, it nonetheless focuses on Angus' survival skills and the devotion of his dog.  One particularly poignant scene involves a rabbit.  Early in the film, Bradford and his buddies are chasing a rabbit and he has the opportunity to kill it with his slingshot but upon seeing the cute little thing, he scares it away.  When he is lost, a rabbit is once again caught by the dog and Angus realizes the difference between hunting for play and for survival.

First, the characters were all thoroughly likable, none of the Hollywood clich&eacute; petty cruelties and insults. The landscapes are spectacular and menacing. The imaginative use of mixed sound and music gives a heightened sense of reality. Even though I saw it on a relatively small screen, it has much of the emotional impact of IMAX. Of course yellow dog steals the show since she is so sincere. This is not a cute film, but a rather scary tale of getting lost, survival and rescue.Only in retrospect did I wonder how the climatic scene was done. I still wonder if everyone, including yellow dog risked their necks to shoot it. The natural world dangers in the film were similar to dangers I have lived myself, so they seemed ever so much more frightening than guns and bombs.
