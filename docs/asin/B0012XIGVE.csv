I keep thinking of people I should give them to because they would love them, but I just can't give them up.There are times in my life when I just want to slow things down and enjoy a romantic novel that I don't have to read. Those are the times when nothing good is on television and I'm just too tired from working on my computer for hours to want to read anything.This collection has a permanent place in my home.",5,What a Delightful Collection!

The content, production values, acting, etc. are generally very good to excellent, and 30 hours of entertainment for the price is good value. However, I have one problem with this set which keeps it from getting 5 stars, the packaging. One of the discs simply falls out of the case, you have to catch it every time, and another disc is somewhat loose. I can find no remedy for the problem, so I will probably end up storing the discs in something other than the original case. if I could separate the two, I would probably give it 5 stars for content, but zero for packaging.",4,"Good content, packaging problem.",1291334400,"12 3, 2010",2010,659,"['bought', 'Amazon', 'Marketplace', 'was', 'New', 'still', 'original', 'shrink', 'wrap', 'content', 'production', 'values', 'acting', 'etc', 'are', 'generally', 'very', 'good', 'excellent', '30', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'price', 'good', 'value', 'However', 'have', 'one', 'problem', 'set', 'getting', '5', 'stars', 'packaging', 'One', 'discs', 'simply', 'case', 'have', 'catch', 'time', 'disc', 'somewhat', 'loose', 'can', 'find', 'remedy', 'problem', 'will', 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'storing', 'discs', 'something', 'other', 'original', 'case', 'could', 'separate', 'two', 'would', 'probably', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'content', 'zero', 'packaging']",The Romance Collection: (Pride and Prejudice / Emma / Jane Eyre / Ivanhoe / Tom Jones / and more)
