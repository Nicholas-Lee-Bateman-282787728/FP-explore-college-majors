891403,AE8LL9S715YTE,B0007UVXCC,"Amazon Customer ""fbrobertson2""","[3, 8]","I hate to say this, but American (slasher haven) and even European (think Zombie 2 through 5 as prime examples of bad horror) have left me bored.  American and European horror has just left me cold, or at worse, luke-warm (where you just want to spit the film out, so to speak).  Most horror films you see in the movie theaters these days are just plain bad.  Big names and big special effects drive the stories along to such an extent, that you really don't care what's going on by the end of the film.  You just want the film to end.  I'll give examples of tiresome horror, the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the abysmal Seed of Chucky, the yawn producing Secret Window, the eye rolling House of the Dead.  Ok, that's enough, I've got a bad taste in my mouth.  They follow the same cliches, or they are gore scenes pieced together for the sake of gore scenes.  Stories are badly written, if at all, and I'm just tired of what I see.  Now, I will admit I liked a few select movies: Constantine, the remake of Dawn of the Dead, Boogeyman, Exorcist the Beginning, and the Resident Evil series.  Still, over all, I find myself let down again and again by Hollywood.  Do I really need to see another vampire movie?  No.  Do I really need to see another supernatural hack and slasher like Jason moving around killing fools?  No.  I want something that will make me question, that will make me fear.Thus I have begun, curious enough through watching films like Koma, to examine the Asian horror field.  I've loved films like Tale of Two Sisters, Koma, and Ju-On (though I have to admit I like the American version, Grudge).  I've also enjoyed the more known movies on the state side like Ringu.  Today I went to the local store and found this gem of a movie, Nightmare.  The movie did have extreme violence, but, the violence was a part of the story, not the whole story in and of itself (like so many Western horror movies these days).  The movie is pieced together like a magician's show, sleight of hands pulling and pushing the story along at an eager pace.  You dont know what's going on, you are as bewildered as the main female star, and you think you know what's going on, when the film superbly pulls off another trick to bring a sense of horror down one's spine.  What I like maybe about the Asian horror movies such as Nightmare and Ringu (for example) is that the Asian perspective of natural and supernatural to be so linked together, running together where there is no end and no beginning.  Where the American and European horror movies go for shock value and mindless cliches of supernatural, the Asian horror movies like Nightmare show that reality is not as it appears, that we only see a bit of the whole, and when we finally see the whole, we find fear.  For those of you who like real horror, intelligent horror, I would suggest this film.  It works wonders to bring about your own nightmares real.",5,"I'd give the movie a go, on a few conditions of course",1123200000,"08 5, 2005",2005,2922,"['hate', 'say', 'American', 'slasher', 'haven', 'even', 'European', 'think', 'Zombie', '2', 'through', '5', 'prime', 'examples', 'bad', 'horror', 'have', 'left', 'bored', 'American', 'European', 'horror', 'just', 'left', 'cold', 'worse', 'luke-warm', 'where', 'just', 'want', 'spit', 'film', 'out', 'so', 'speak', 'Most', 'horror', 'films', 'see', 'movie', 'theaters', 'days', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'Big', 'names', 'big', 'special', 'effects', 'drive', 'stories', 'extent', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'going', 'end', 'film', 'just', 'want', 'film', 'end', ""'ll"", 'give', 'examples', 'tiresome', 'horror', 'remake', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'abysmal', 'Seed', 'Chucky', 'yawn', 'producing', 'Secret', 'Window', 'eye', 'rolling', 'House', 'Dead', 'Ok', 'enough', ""'ve"", 'got', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'follow', 'same', 'cliches', 'are', 'gore', 'scenes', 'pieced', 'together', 'sake', 'gore', 'scenes', 'Stories', 'are', 'badly', 'written', ""'m"", 'just', 'tired', 'what', 'see', 'Now', 'will', 'admit', 'liked', 'few', 'select', 'movies', 'Constantine', 'remake', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Boogeyman', 'Exorcist', 'Beginning', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'series', 'Still', 'find', 'let', 'down', 'again', 'again', 'Hollywood', 'Do', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'vampire', 'movie', 'No', 'Do', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'supernatural', 'hack', 'slasher', 'Jason', 'moving', 'around', 'killing', 'fools', 'want', 'something', 'will', 'make', 'question', 'will', 'make', 'fear.Thus', 'have', 'begun', 'curious', 'enough', 'watching', 'films', 'Koma', 'examine', 'Asian', 'horror', 'field', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'films', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'Koma', 'Ju-On', 'have', 'admit', 'American', 'version', 'Grudge', ""'ve"", 'also', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'known', 'movies', 'state', 'side', 'Ringu', 'Today', 'went', 'local', 'store', 'found', 'gem', 'movie', 'Nightmare', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'extreme', 'violence', 'violence', 'was', 'part', 'story', 'not', 'whole', 'story', 'so', 'many', 'Western', 'horror', 'movies', 'days', 'movie', 'pieced', 'together', 'magician', 'show', 'sleight', 'hands', 'pulling', 'pushing', 'story', 'along', 'eager', 'pace', 'dont', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'are', 'as', 'bewildered', 'main', 'female', 'star', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'when', 'film', 'superbly', 'off', 'trick', 'bring', 'sense', 'horror', 'one', 'spine', 'What', 'like', 'maybe', 'Asian', 'horror', 'movies', 'such', 'Nightmare', 'Ringu', 'example', 'Asian', 'perspective', 'natural', 'supernatural', 'be', 'so', 'linked', 'together', 'running', 'together', 'where', 'end', 'beginning', 'Where', 'American', 'European', 'horror', 'movies', 'go', 'shock', 'value', 'mindless', 'cliches', 'supernatural', 'Asian', 'horror', 'movies', 'Nightmare', 'show', 'reality', 'not', 'only', 'see', 'bit', 'whole', 'when', 'finally', 'see', 'whole', 'find', 'fear', 'who', 'real', 'horror', 'intelligent', 'horror', 'would', 'suggest', 'film', 'wonders', 'bring', 'about', 'own', 'nightmares', 'real']",N/A
891404,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B0007UVXCC,Ernest Jagger,"[1, 1]","""Nightmare,"" by director Byeong-ki Ahn, is neither a very good horror film, nor a very good slasher film. The film begins with a pretty good start: You witness the body of a young girl in a morgue who is having her eyes stitched shut. Fast forward into the future, and the films narrative begins with a a group of former college friends who are being killed off one by one. Is this the work of a mentally unstable woman? Or is it the vengeful spirit of one of the groups former friends who was accidentally killed years before? The film leaves you guessing as to whether or not this is the work of either a killer, or a ghost. Or maybe both?As the films narrative moves along, you see a young woman, Sun-ae (Jeong-yun Choi) who has just returned from the United States, after a two year absence. Moreover, she is hiding out in one of the friends' apartment; and she believes the ghost of this vengeful spirit is out to take revenge and kill her. The viewer sees Kyungh-ah (Ji-won Ha) as the vengeful ghost who is on an unstoppable mission. Or is it? As the bodies begin to pile up, some of the friends are warned by detectives that one of the girls, Sun-ae (Jeong-yun Choi) has been in a mental hospital, and is either the killer, or maybe in danger herself. She has sought refuge in the apartment of one of her friends, who was also once part of her inner circle of friends: Hye-jin (Gyu-ri Kim).These few survivors are what remain of the college friends who know of the terrible secret regarding Kyungh-ah [aka: Eun-ju]. Although this film was probably inspired by ""Prom Night,"" that is not the problem. The major problem with this film is the scriptwriting and cohesion of the film itself. The film is very disjointed, and the back and forth flashbacks from past and present were a little irritating. And while the film was not really original, I could deal with that. However, the film was slow and boring. This film will probably appeal to those who like slasher films, whether or not it is foreign. This is not the worst Asian horror film I have seen, however, the film just isn't that good either.",2,Not One Of Korea's Better Horror Films!,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,2104,"['Nightmare', 'director', 'Byeong-ki', 'Ahn', 'very', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'slasher', 'film', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'start', 'witness', 'body', 'young', 'girl', 'morgue', 'who', 'having', 'eyes', 'stitched', 'shut', 'Fast', 'forward', 'future', 'films', 'narrative', 'begins', 'group', 'former', 'college', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'killed', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'work', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'woman', 'vengeful', 'spirit', 'one', 'groups', 'former', 'friends', 'who', 'was', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'years', 'film', 'guessing', 'not', 'work', 'killer', 'ghost', 'maybe', 'films', 'narrative', 'moves', 'along', 'see', 'young', 'woman', 'Sun-ae', 'Jeong-yun', 'Choi', 'who', 'just', 'returned', 'United', 'States', 'two', 'year', 'absence', 'Moreover', 'hiding', 'out', 'one', 'friends', 'apartment', 'ghost', 'vengeful', 'spirit', 'out', 'take', 'revenge', 'kill', 'viewer', 'Kyungh-ah', 'Ji-won', 'Ha', 'vengeful', 'ghost', 'who', 'unstoppable', 'mission', 'bodies', 'begin', 'pile', 'up', 'friends', 'are', 'warned', 'detectives', 'one', 'girls', 'Sun-ae', 'Jeong-yun', 'Choi', 'been', 'mental', 'hospital', 'killer', 'maybe', 'danger', 'herself', 'sought', 'refuge', 'apartment', 'one', 'friends', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'once', 'part', 'inner', 'circle', 'friends', 'Hye-jin', 'Gyu-ri', 'Kim', '.These', 'few', 'survivors', 'are', 'what', 'remain', 'college', 'friends', 'who', 'know', 'terrible', 'secret', 'regarding', 'Kyungh-ah', '[', 'aka', 'Eun-ju', ']', 'film', 'was', 'probably', 'inspired', 'Prom', 'Night', 'not', 'problem', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'scriptwriting', 'cohesion', 'film', 'film', 'very', 'disjointed', 'back', 'forth', 'flashbacks', 'past', 'present', 'were', 'little', 'irritating', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'original', 'could', 'deal', 'However', 'film', 'was', 'slow', 'boring', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'appeal', 'who', 'slasher', 'films', 'not', 'foreign', 'not', 'worst', 'Asian', 'horror', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'however', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'that', 'good']",N/A

The woman, Sun Ae, drops in on her friend Hyun Jin and while there, makes some cryptic remarks about needing to escape from a girl who is dead.  From this point, things fall apart.  The dead girl, who may or may not be haunting them, appears to be killing off the band of buddies one by one.  Meanwhile, there is a series of subplots about bad business dealings, and adultery.  Throw a series of semingly unrelated flashbacks into the mix and you get a movie that is almost incomprehensible.  On a second viewing (yes, I am a masochist), I was able to piece together that the dead girl's ghost isn't doing the killings.  Instead, she is possessing the real murderer(s).

Just a little black around the eyes and she's as creepy as they come. And quite beautiful too. In fact, the only redeeming quality of this attempt to jump on the I Know What You Did Last Summer style of horror bandwagon is that all the female players are gorgeous. And they do a fine job acting. Beyond that, compliments are hard to muster.I hesitate to single out someone for deep ridicule but the guy who plays the lawyer in this flick, his acting is so bad it's painful. He ruins the film. Well, a script that is convoluted beyond repair doesn't help but if it was the script alone it wouldn't be painful. There's an inverse relationship between the film's cohesion and the level of badness to this guy's acting. As the film falls apart, making suspension of disbelief nearly unattainable, this guy gets more screen time and becomes more obnoxious. By the time the third act rolls around it's a chore not to hit the eject button.There are buckets and buckets of blood spilled and some of the kills are pretty good, and, much to my surprise as it's unusual in Korean cinema featuring young starlets, there's brief nudity, Ha Ji-won included. So it's got the ingredients. They're just not stirred very well. A group of friends, boys and girls, belong to an organization called ""A Few Good Men"". They (accidentally?) kill one of their members and try to cover it up by faking it as a suicide. The one who got killed is bummed out by it so she comes back and starts killing the members of the club, one by one. Good thing one of the members is a videographer and gets all of it on tape. Also a good thing that no one else in the community seems aware of all the bloodshed ... but I digress. The hilarious thing about this videotape is that it is magically done in third-person, if you will. Several times all of the characters are actually in the video. And the guy with the camera, just after assisting with pushing the deceased off a rooftop in the attempted fake suicide, flies out into mid-air, and even does a pull back, so we get a good view of the body going down and eventually landing on the roof of a car. I know this can be explained by security cameras, editing, and artistic license to splice in other people's points of view, but it's still hilarious when you watch it.All in all there is some enjoyment to be had from watching a handful of attractive young Koreans go through the horror motions, but I can pretty much guarantee you will be groaning and moaning and pointing fingers and poking fun at this flick before it's over.",2,Bad outweighs the good,1263254400,"01 12, 2010",2010,2649,"['Ha', 'Ji-won', 'fabulous', 'here', 'playing', 'Korean', 'JHGC', 'J-Horror', 'Goth', 'Chick', 'bangs', 'neatly', 'combed', 'hair', 'Just', 'little', 'black', 'eyes', 'as', 'creepy', 'come', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'too', 'fact', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'attempt', 'jump', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summer', 'style', 'horror', 'bandwagon', 'female', 'players', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'acting', 'Beyond', 'compliments', 'are', 'hard', 'muster.I', 'hesitate', 'single', 'out', 'someone', 'deep', 'ridicule', 'guy', 'who', 'lawyer', 'flick', 'acting', 'so', 'bad', 'painful', 'film', 'Well', 'script', 'convoluted', 'repair', ""n't"", 'help', 'was', 'script', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'painful', 'inverse', 'relationship', 'film', 'cohesion', 'level', 'badness', 'guy', 'acting', 'film', 'apart', 'making', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'nearly', 'unattainable', 'guy', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'more', 'obnoxious', 'time', 'third', 'act', 'rolls', 'chore', 'not', 'hit', 'eject', 'are', 'buckets', 'buckets', 'blood', 'spilled', 'kills', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'much', 'surprise', 'unusual', 'Korean', 'cinema', 'featuring', 'young', 'starlets', 'brief', 'nudity', 'Ha', 'Ji-won', 'included', 'got', 'ingredients', ""'re"", 'just', 'not', 'stirred', 'very', 'well', 'group', 'friends', 'boys', 'girls', 'belong', 'organization', 'called', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'accidentally', 'kill', 'one', 'members', 'try', 'cover', 'up', 'faking', 'suicide', 'one', 'who', 'got', 'killed', 'bummed', 'out', 'back', 'killing', 'members', 'club', 'one', 'one', 'Good', 'thing', 'one', 'members', 'videographer', 'tape', 'Also', 'good', 'thing', 'one', 'else', 'community', 'aware', 'bloodshed', 'digress', 'hilarious', 'thing', 'videotape', 'magically', 'done', 'third-person', 'will', 'Several', 'times', 'characters', 'are', 'actually', 'video', 'guy', 'camera', 'just', 'assisting', 'pushing', 'deceased', 'off', 'rooftop', 'attempted', 'fake', 'suicide', 'out', 'mid-air', 'even', 'pull', 'back', 'get', 'good', 'view', 'body', 'going', 'down', 'eventually', 'landing', 'roof', 'car', 'know', 'can', 'be', 'explained', 'security', 'cameras', 'editing', 'artistic', 'license', 'splice', 'other', 'people', 'points', 'view', 'still', 'hilarious', 'when', 'watch', 'it.All', 'enjoyment', 'be', 'had', 'watching', 'handful', 'attractive', 'young', 'Koreans', 'go', 'horror', 'motions', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guarantee', 'will', 'be', 'groaning', 'moaning', 'pointing', 'fingers', 'poking', 'fun', 'flick', 'over']",N/A

Group of young-and-beautifuls shares dark secret that returns to bite them in the collective behind, and they start dying one by one. The subject of many a giallo, and later, many an American slasher film. Why not resurrect it in the Asian horror boom?Well, I'll tell you why-- because it's not always the case that Asian horror is better than American (or Italian) horror simply because it came from somewhere west of Hollywood and east of Bollywood. While it has generally been the case that they do grow 'em big out there, some Asian horror films are simply derivative shlock that's, at best, worth killing an hour and a half with, and that's the case here. There's no real standout acting, the direction is competent if pedestrian, the movie relies heavily on Western tricks to make you jump out of your chair rather than setting the eerie atmosphere that makes so many Asian horror films of the last thirty years so wonderful. That said, the young-and-beautifuls really are young and beautiful, and like most bad genre horror/mystery flicks, it moves along at a rapid enough pace that it's not a torture to watch.

You all should probably know a little about the storyline, so I'll just go into what I think they could've improved on:1 - The first half of the movie was confusing and slow. Sure, they tie it all together at the end, but they could've made the retracing of what happened in the past more apparent. I was watching the movie in present-time and had no idea they were retracing the characters' previous actions. For a while, it felt like several random scenes were being pieced together which was apparently supposed to make sense.2 - The make-up effects were laughable. The ghost looked like a goth chick and wasn't that scary at all.3 - The movie assumes you know everything about the main characters. The characters go around and talk about specific things to each other more than half-way into the movie which should've been brought up/hinted on/foreshadowed earlier as to avoid confusion. The characters hold connections to each other that just felt tossed in just to make the relationships seem more dense.Yeah... if they would've spent a little bit more time going over everything, they could've made the storyline easier to follow, thus making the movie more enjoyable. Oh, and they should also take a few notes from their Japanese horror counterparts because the ghost was seriously not scary. But don't be dismayed... everything comes together in the last 30 minutes of the film (making everything a bit more intense), and the ending was actually kind of cool, so the movie is at least worth being rented first.",3,Hey - At least it's Asian horror.,1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,1613,"['Nightmare', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'lot', 'better', 'then', 'again', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'lot', 'worse', 'should', 'probably', 'know', 'little', 'storyline', ""'ll"", 'just', 'go', 'what', 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'improved', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'confusing', 'slow', 'Sure', 'tie', 'together', 'end', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'retracing', 'what', 'happened', 'past', 'more', 'apparent', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'present-time', 'had', 'idea', 'were', 'retracing', 'characters', 'previous', 'actions', 'while', 'felt', 'several', 'random', 'scenes', 'were', 'being', 'pieced', 'together', 'was', 'apparently', 'supposed', 'make', 'sense.2', 'make-up', 'effects', 'were', 'laughable', 'ghost', 'looked', 'goth', 'chick', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'all.3', 'movie', 'know', 'everything', 'main', 'characters', 'characters', 'go', 'around', 'talk', 'specific', 'things', 'other', 'more', 'half-way', 'movie', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'brought', 'up/hinted', 'on/foreshadowed', 'earlier', 'avoid', 'confusion', 'characters', 'hold', 'connections', 'other', 'just', 'felt', 'tossed', 'just', 'make', 'relationships', 'seem', 'more', 'dense.Yeah', 'would', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'going', 'everything', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'storyline', 'easier', 'follow', 'thus', 'making', 'movie', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Oh', 'should', 'also', 'take', 'few', 'notes', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'counterparts', 'ghost', 'was', 'seriously', 'not', 'scary', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'dismayed', 'everything', 'together', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'making', 'everything', 'bit', 'more', 'intense', 'ending', 'was', 'actually', 'kind', 'cool', 'movie', 'least', 'worth', 'being', 'rented', 'first']",N/A
