Sun,"[5, 7]","After reading the negative comments regarding how it's not the same with just Mickey, Keith and Bryan I still decided to give this DVD a chance because I never heard them without the full band and this DVD received good reviews.As talented as these three guys are - the sound just isn't the same without 2 guitars, keyboards, or other instruments in certain songs.Some songs like Summer of '69, Run to You, Cloud #9, etc., really cry out for the missing musicians and the added character the songs have with a full band.There is nothing to look at in this DVD. The 3 band members are dressed in white T shirts and white pants and the stage is really barren and there is no show aspect at all.The production is good and the sound is clear, however Live! Live! Live! really is a far better representation of the concert Bryan Adams sound.Unplugged has better versions of classic songs presented in a different way and the use of the Michael Kamen led Julliard students, Irish pipes, and other little surprises, along with all the band members make that a special collection of Bryan Adams music.Bryan Adams REALLY needs to just remaster and release all his videos on DVD with Dolby 5.1 sound.Bryan also needs to go back on guitar and hire at least a bass player and keyboardist to get the sound back to what it is supposed to be.",2,2 Stars Because it's Bryan Adams,1087948800,"06 23, 2004",2004,1327,"['reading', 'negative', 'comments', 'regarding', 'how', 'not', 'same', 'just', 'Mickey', 'Keith', 'Bryan', 'still', 'decided', 'give', 'DVD', 'chance', 'never', 'heard', 'full', 'band', 'DVD', 'received', 'good', 'reviews.As', 'talented', 'three', 'guys', 'are', 'sound', 'just', ""n't"", 'same', '2', 'guitars', 'keyboards', 'other', 'instruments', 'certain', 'songs.Some', 'songs', 'Summer', ""'69"", 'Run', 'Cloud', '9', 'etc.', 'really', 'out', 'missing', 'musicians', 'added', 'character', 'songs', 'have', 'full', 'band.There', 'nothing', 'look', 'DVD', '3', 'band', 'members', 'are', 'dressed', 'white', 'T', 'shirts', 'white', 'pants', 'stage', 'really', 'barren', 'show', 'aspect', 'all.The', 'production', 'good', 'sound', 'clear', 'however', 'Live', 'Live', 'Live', 'really', 'far', 'better', 'representation', 'concert', 'Bryan', 'Adams', 'sound.Unplugged', 'better', 'versions', 'classic', 'songs', 'presented', 'different', 'way', 'use', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'led', 'Julliard', 'students', 'Irish', 'pipes', 'other', 'little', 'surprises', 'band', 'members', 'make', 'special', 'collection', 'Bryan', 'Adams', 'music.Bryan', 'Adams', 'REALLY', 'just', 'remaster', 'release', 'videos', 'DVD', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'sound.Bryan', 'also', 'go', 'back', 'guitar', 'hire', 'least', 'bass', 'player', 'keyboardist', 'get', 'sound', 'back', 'what', 'supposed', 'be']",N/A

Only three people on stage: Bryan, a guitar player and the drumer. I think that's enough to play good rock music, as they did. Track lists are the same for those concerts, so that's not a difference.The main difference is the attendance. I think it would be wondeful to be at Slane Castle. Robbie Williams also performed a concert there, another success. However, it's not the same in Japan. They are enthusiastic, the scream loudly but that's not enough to reach Ireland's atmosphere.Another thing: when Bryan wanna sing ""When You're Gone"", a girl climbs to the stage and try to sing the song... I'd like to forget that...I give 3.5 stars to this DVD, for Bryan's music.",4,It was nearly the same at Slane Castle,1092096000,"08 10, 2004",2004,744,"['bought', 'two', 'DVDs', 'Live', 'Budokan', 'Live', 'Slane', 'Castle', 'Only', 'three', 'people', 'stage', 'Bryan', 'guitar', 'player', 'drumer', 'think', 'enough', 'play', 'good', 'rock', 'music', 'did', 'Track', 'lists', 'are', 'same', 'concerts', 'not', 'difference.The', 'main', 'difference', 'attendance', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'wondeful', 'be', 'Slane', 'Castle', 'Robbie', 'Williams', 'also', 'performed', 'concert', 'there', 'success', 'However', 'not', 'same', 'Japan', 'are', 'enthusiastic', 'scream', 'loudly', 'not', 'enough', 'reach', 'Ireland', 'atmosphere.Another', 'thing', 'when', 'Bryan', 'wan', 'na', 'sing', 'When', ""'re"", 'girl', 'climbs', 'stage', 'try', 'sing', 'song', ""'d"", 'like', 'forget', 'give', '3.5', 'stars', 'DVD', 'Bryan', 'music']",N/A
760580,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B0000A02WV,L.A. Scene,"[8, 8]","Bryan Adams has always been a good artist when it comes to making live material available on either CD or DVD format.  Thus, I immediately was excited when I heard that Bryan Adams was releasing a live performance DVD called ""Bryan Adams: Live at The Budokan"".  The Budokan is basically the Madison Square Garden of concert venues in Tokyo.  Whenever I hear the word ""Budokan"", I think to what might be one of the most legendary live performances ever - Cheap Trick's 1978 concert which became a legendary album.  I've seen and heard the energy of Bryan Adams live in person, on the ""Live Live Live"" CD, and the ""MTV Unplugged"" performance.  I know Bryan Adams is as capable as anyone when it comes to delivering a knockout with a live performance.  When I heard that he was releasing a live performance at the legendary Budokan - now I was really psyched.  This particular DVD has its moments, but it is more of a TKO as opposed to the slam dunk knockout I would have expected.Bryan Adams has always surrounded himself with a top band.  For the 2+ decades of his career, I have always thought of Bryan Adams as ""Team Adams"".  For most of this time, Bryan has had Mickey Curry on Drums, Dave Taylor on Bass,  Tommy Mandel on Keyboards, and Keith Scott on Lead Guitar.  On his last studio album in 1998 ""On a Day Like Today"" - gone was Tommy Mandel.  By the time 2000 rolled around, gone also was Dave Taylor.  The performance at the Budokan is a trio performance.  I look at this as a double edged sword.  From one standpoint, I do think the stage presence of Tommy Mandel and Dave Scott are missed.  I also think having any extra players on stage to fill the roles would have been nice.  Keyboards have played a key role Adams' music.  As for the role of the Bass,  Bryan himself takes on that instrument for most of the concert (except for the acoustic numbers), so the band is down one less guitar player.  However, there is an upside to this - Bryan, Mickey, and Keith Scott really turn it up a notch.  They produce every sound on stage and in the process do a fantastic job in the process - especially Scott who in addition to some incredible guitar work really shines on background vocals.The stage itself is disappointing.  To me, it almost seems more like a stage for an 'A&E; By Request' concert than a concert that is at one of the most legendary venues of the music business.  The band itself is all dressed in white, and this doesn't enhance the stage presence visually.  I also think the production work wasn't the best.  You don't get a real good feel for the crowd during much of the performance.  What has always been a strength of an Adams performance - whether in person, on CD, or on video is the connection with the crowd.  Yes, Adams connects with the crowd, but visually you don't see this as much due to the editing.  Much of this live performance has more of a feel of a private performance as opposed to connecting with the masses of the audience.The performance gets off to a bit of a slow start.  I don't think Adams really starts to connect with the audience until the fifth number ('Summer of 69').  There are some very good highlights in the concert once it starts cranking.  Despite no Tina Turner on ""It's Only Love"", Adams is able to pull things off without a female vocalist thanks to some amazing guitar work and background vocals by Keith Scott.  Adams doesn't do a lot of stuff from ""Into the Fire"" (an amazing album), but there is a rare performance of the title track from that album.  ""Into the Fire"" had been included on the ""Live Live Live"" album, but this version is much more hard rocking and is much better than that one.  Adams also does a rare performance of ""Remember"" (from his self titled debut album 'Bryan Adams').  ""Remember"" is one of the highlights of this performance and once again Keith Scott really shines added some terrific background vocals.  There also is a terrific version of ""Run to You"" that is delivered - this is probably the best live version of the song I have seen and heard of this signature Adams tune.A couple of other disapponting things..  The version of ""(Everything I Do) I Do It For You"" is the shorter version and doesn't contain the great instrumental at the end that are heard on the ""Waking Up the Neighbours"" CD.  The girl he picks from the audience to do co-vocals for ""When You're Gone"" (a tradition at Adams' concerts) is disappointing.  I can understand that she might not know all of the words - but I've seen other girls deliver a lot more passion and energy than this girl did.  There are also 4 ""Bonus Tracks"" (""Fits Ya Good"", ""I Don't Wanna Live Forever"", ""Before the Night is Over"", ""Still Beautiful To Me"") and I don't undertstand why these aren't just part of the regular performance.  The four bonus tracks would have much been better if they were integrated into the flow of the concert.  There is not a lot of interaction with the crowd and really seem like a private performance.  On the plus side, these are four excellent tracks - with ""Before the Night is Over"" being the MVP of the four songs.The DVD contains some a booklet that gives credits for the songs, but nothing that will give you any additional insight into the performance.  Despite many of these shortcomings, this is still a pretty good DVD - but it could have been a lot better.  All in all, it will keep the Adams fans happy and may even be good for the casual Adams fan.",4,Could have been better - but still pretty good,1091923200,"08 8, 2004",2004,5441,"['Bryan', 'Adams',
