1296511,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B002W1HBIO,Haunted Flower,"[4, 5]","Gary Unmarried - The Complete First Season TV on DVD Review20 Episodes on 3 Discs Widescreen Edition (2010)""Gary Unmarried"" is a sitcom about a single dad paint contractor, Gary Brooks (Jay Mohr) who has a very workable relationship with his ex-wife, Allison (Paula Marshall) as they take care of the kids and fight. Paula is engaged to their marriage counselor Dr. Krandall played by Ed Begley Jr. and Gary is trying to date again after fifteen years of marriage and has managed to find another single-mom hottie Vanessa (Jaime King). Their son, Tom (Ryan Malgarini) is just getting interested in girls and their daughter, Louise (Kathryn Newton) is trying to save the world and has a crush on Al Gore.I haven't watched comedy sitcoms since Home Improvement, Family Matters, and Seinfeld when I was younger so the first thing that struck me watching this first season of this show was the canned laughter. It takes a lot to get used to again, it just feels so phony. After a few episodes it started to feel familiar again, but the jokes are mostly just average. It's a bunch of situational comedy. Introduce conflict, have silly resolutions along the way, problem over. A list of typical situations: son dating, Gary dating the kids' teachers, Allison & her fiance getting cold feet, their daughter being TOO talented, meeting a new girlfriends' friends, whose house to have Thanksgiving at, the ex-wife and the new girlfriend getting along too well, etc.Jay Mohr was great in Jerry Maguire, but just average here. He holds his own as star of the series, but the series itself isn't very memorable. His character, Gary is a lazy irresponsible dad who acts like a big kid. It's almost like Tim Allen's character from Home Improvement but without the tool snafus and he isn't married. The divorced couple still has fights just as if they were married, they just seem to live at different houses. They are perfectly happy being divorced because they don't like each other very much dating-wise. Gary and Allison get divorced but Allison still takes care of him and so does his new girlfriend, Vanessa so he doesn't have to learn anything or be responsible. I guess this is what shows are built on!The kids are just ok, very predictable. Louise's self righteousness gets old VERY fast and she was re-cast right after the pilot episode, first a little brunette, then a blond with curls reminiscent of Goldilocks, pretty obvious. Tom tries to use relationship slang whenever possible when talking about girls and it's weird, but I bet parents would think it's funny and endearing.It has been frequented by a number of good guest stars like Jane Curtin, Martin Mull, and Matthew Lillard. Jaime King seems almost like a bait-and-switch because she is in the series quite a bit in the beginning and then vanishes. Poof!I'm not a parent or divorced so this show is just ok by me and I wouldn't watch it unless it were the only thing on. However, that being said, I bet lots of single/divorced parents would find it very funny and refreshing to have a take on divorce that doesn't involve the two people screaming at each other constantly and the wife being an evil dragon lady. Apparently this series has been a success so far because it was picked up for another season.DVD Extras:First, there is a series of silly bloopers. Then a feature where you can spend a day with Jay Mohr on the set of the show. Then there is a feature called ""Planet Begley"" about Ed Begley Jr. making the set more eco-friendly. Lastly a feature called ""The Chemistry of Comedy"" consists of an all-access tour of the show with the cast and crew.",2,I'd only watch this if nothing else was on. It's funny but not enough for my time.,1268179200,"03 10, 2010",2010,3613,"['Gary', 'Unmarried', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'TV', 'DVD', 'Review20', 'Episodes', '3', 'Discs', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', '2010', 'Gary', 'Unmarried', 'sitcom', 'single', 'dad', 'paint', 'contractor', 'Gary', 'Brooks', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'who', 'very', 'workable', 'relationship', 'ex-wife', 'Allison', 'Paula', 'Marshall', 'take', 'care', 'kids', 'fight', 'Paula', 'engaged', 'marriage', 'counselor', 'Dr.', 'Krandall', 'played', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'Gary', 'trying', 'date', 'again', 'fifteen', 'years', 'marriage', 'managed', 'find', 'single-mom', 'hottie', 'Vanessa', 'Jaime', 'King', 'son', 'Tom', 'Ryan', 'Malgarini', 'just', 'getting', 'interested', 'girls', 'daughter', 'Louise', 'Kathryn', 'Newton', 'trying', 'save', 'world', 'crush', 'Al', 'Gore.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'comedy', 'sitcoms', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'Family', 'Matters', 'Seinfeld', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'so', 'first', 'thing', 'struck', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'canned', 'laughter', 'lot', 'get', 'used', 'again', 'just', 'feels', 'so', 'phony', 'few', 'episodes', 'started', 'feel', 'familiar', 'again', 'jokes', 'are', 'mostly', 'just', 'average', 'bunch', 'situational', 'comedy', 'Introduce', 'conflict', 'have', 'silly', 'resolutions', 'way', 'problem', 'list', 'typical', 'situations', 'son', 'dating', 'Gary', 'dating', 'kids', 'teachers', 'Allison', 'fiance', 'getting', 'cold', 'feet', 'daughter', 'being', 'TOO', 'talented', 'meeting', 'new', 'girlfriends', 'friends', 'house', 'have', 'Thanksgiving', 'ex-wife', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'getting', 'along', 'too', 'well', 'etc.Jay', 'Mohr', 'was', 'great', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'just', 'average', 'here', 'own', 'star', 'series', 'series', ""n't"", 'very', 'memorable', 'character', 'Gary', 'lazy', 'irresponsible', 'dad', 'who', 'big', 'kid', 'almost', 'like', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'character', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'tool', 'snafus', ""n't"", 'married', 'divorced', 'couple', 'still', 'fights', 'just', 'were', 'married', 'just', 'seem', 'live', 'different', 'houses', 'are', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'being', 'divorced', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'other', 'very', 'much', 'dating-wise', 'Gary', 'Allison', 'get', 'divorced', 'Allison', 'still', 'care', 'so', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Vanessa', 'so', ""n't"", 'have', 'learn', 'anything', 'be', 'responsible', 'guess', 'what', 'shows', 'are', 'built', 'kids', 'are', 'just', 'ok', 'very', 'predictable', 'Louise', 'self', 'righteousness', 'old', 'VERY', 'fast', 'was', 're-cast', 'right', 'pilot', 'episode', 'first', 'little', 'brunette', 'then', 'blond', 'curls', 'reminiscent', 'Goldilocks', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'Tom', 'use', 'relationship', 'slang', 'whenever', 'possible', 'when', 'talking', 'girls', 'weird', 'bet', 'parents', 'would', 'think', 'funny', 'endearing.It', 'been', 'frequented', 'number', 'good', 'guest', 'stars', 'Jane', 'Curtin', 'Martin', 'Mull', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Jaime', 'King', 'almost', 'bait-and-switch', 'series', 'quite', 'bit', 'beginning', 'then', 'vanishes', 'Poof', ""'m"", 'not', 'parent', 'divorced', 'show', 'just', 'ok', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'were', 'only', 'thing', 'However', 'being', 'said', 'bet', 'lots', 'single/divorced', 'parents', 'would', 'find', 'very', 'funny', 'refreshing', 'have', 'take', 'divorce', ""n't"", 'involve', 'two', 'people', 'screaming', 'other', 'constantly', 'wife', 'being', 'evil', 'dragon', 'lady', 'Apparently', 'series', 'been', 'success', 'so', 'far', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'season.DVD', 'Extras', 'First', 'series', 'silly', 'bloopers', 'Then', 'feature', 'where', 'can', 'spend', 'day', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'set', 'show', 'Then', 'feature', 'called', 'Planet', 'Begley', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'making', 'set', 'more', 'eco-friendly', 'Lastly', 'feature', 'called', 'Chemistry', 'Comedy', 'all-access', 'tour', 'show', 'cast', 'crew']",Gary Unmarried: Season 1
1296512,A19XE6G6NDZFPS,B002W1HBIO,Joanna Mechlinski,"[5, 5]","Having become a fan of the funny Jay Mohr during his time on ""Ghost Whisperer,"" I was excited to learn he'd gotten a show of his own and really had high hopes for it. However, while it does have some better episodes/moments than others, I do have to say that for the most part, there's really nothing to make this show stand out from scads of other predictable sitcoms.The premise of the show centers upon Gary Brooks (Jay Mohr) having recently divorced his wife of many years, Allison (Paula Marshall). The two share custody of their teen children, Tom - a typically goofy, slightly lazy young male like his dad in many ways - and Louise, an overachieving perfectionist. Gary is self-employed as a painter, while Allison is a stay-at-home mom. While Gary is just beginning to get back into dating after many years of marriage, Allison has already found someone new, and is already engaged.Many of the show's conflicts and humor stem from the differences between Gary's and Allison's personalities and parenting styles; Gary is very mellow and laid back, often bordering on irresponsible, while Allison is quite driven and super-organized in all areas of life. In her weaker moments, she worries that her children and others around her see her as someone who drains the fun out of their lives, and it further fuels the fights between her and Gary, as she faults his lack of responsibility with the reason for why she needs to be the way she is.",3,"Cute, though somewhat generic, sitcom",1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,1444,"['Having', 'become', 'fan', 'funny', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'time', 'Ghost', 'Whisperer', 'was', 'excited', 'learn', ""'d"", 'gotten', 'show', 'own', 'really', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'However', 'have', 'better', 'episodes/moments', 'others', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'most', 'part', 'really', 'nothing', 'make', 'show', 'stand', 'out', 'scads', 'other', 'predictable', 'sitcoms.The', 'premise', 'show', 'Gary', 'Brooks', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'having', 'recently', 'divorced', 'wife', 'many', 'years', 'Allison', 'Paula', 'Marshall', 'two', 'share', 'custody', 'teen', 'children', 'Tom', 'typically', 'goofy', 'slightly', 'lazy', 'young', 'male', 'dad', 'many', 'ways', 'Louise', 'overachieving', 'perfectionist', 'Gary', 'self-employed', 'painter', 'Allison', 'stay-at-home', 'mom', 'Gary', 'just', 'beginning', 'get', 'back', 'dating', 'many', 'years', 'marriage', 'Allison', 'already', 'found', 'someone', 'new', 'already', 'engaged.Many', 'show', 'conflicts', 'humor', 'stem', 'differences', 'Gary', 'Allison', 'personalities', 'parenting', 'styles', 'Gary', 'very', 'mellow', 'laid', 'back', 'often', 'bordering', 'irresponsible', 'Allison', 'quite', 'driven', 'super-organized', 'areas', 'life', 'weaker', 'moments', 'children', 'others', 'see', 'someone', 'who', 'fun', 'lives', 'further', 'fuels', 'fights', 'Gary', 'faults', 'lack', 'responsibility', 'reason', 'why', 'be', 'way']",Gary Unmarried: Season 1
1296513,ABQWMANK4AR63,B002W1HBIO,"John S. Dean ""John""","[0, 0]","People have been reviewing this about how &#34;generic&#34; it is, but I have never seen another show that did such a great job in the back and forth between divorced people.  This is one of my all time favorite shows.  But only Season 1.Season 1 is great.  The quips, the back and forth, the bashing of the ex wife's new fianc&eacute;e due to his age, it's just very, very enjoyable.  Some intelligent humor and great one liners.  The people really are cast well, and they meld great.It's a show about a divorced man and his ex wife and kids.  Yes, it's been done.  But I'm sorry, I really can't see any other show where it was done this well.  There's no end to the byplay between Jay Mohr and Paula Marshall.  Both are hilarious, and she's just adorable to watch in anything because she's so understatedly attractive.  She's got the quick mouth for the comebacks, and handles the lines of dialog perfectly.  Her and Jay complaining at each other really just works.Season 2, not so much.  They changed pretty much the entire supporting cast, and the whole show suffered.  Had they had the same people from season 1, I can see this getting renewed for Season 3 and beyond, but with the cast they had for Season 2, it was almost painful to watch after the awesomeness that was Season 1.  Jay and Paula couldn't save it on their own, which is too bad as they were so much fun to watch together.Great show, definitely worth the cost of the DVD for Season 1, but there's nothing compelling for Season 2.",5,Season 1 outshines season 2 by a huge margin,1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2014,1500,"['People', 'have', 'been', 'reviewing', 'how', '34', 'generic', '34', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'back', 'forth', 'divorced', 'people', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'shows', 'only', 'Season', '1.Season', '1', 'great', 'quips', 'back', 'forth', 'bashing', 'ex', 'wife', 'new', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'due', 'age', 'just', 'very', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'intelligent', 'humor', 'great', 'one', 'liners', 'people', 'really', 'are', 'cast', 'well', 'meld', 'great.It', 'show', 'divorced', 'man', 'ex', 'wife', 'kids', 'Yes', 'been', 'done', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'show', 'where', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'end', 'byplay', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'Paula', 'Marshall', 'are', 'hilarious', 'just', 'adorable', 'watch', 'anything', 'so', 'understatedly', 'attractive', 'got', 'quick', 'mouth', 'comebacks', 'lines', 'dialog', 'perfectly', 'Jay', 'complaining', 'other', 'really', 'just', 'works.Season', '2', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'changed', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'whole', 'show', 'suffered', 'Had', 'had', 'same', 'people', 'season', '1', 'can', 'see', 'getting', 'renewed', 'Season', '3', 'cast', 'had', 'Season', '2', 'was', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'awesomeness', 'was', 'Season', '1', 'Jay', 'Paula', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'own', 'too', 'bad', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'together.Great', 'show', 'definitely', 'cost', 'DVD', 'Season', '1', 'nothing', 'compelling', 'Season', '2']",Gary Unmarried: Season 1
