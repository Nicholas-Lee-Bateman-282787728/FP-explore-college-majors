The lead character is from 2013, but he doesn't make any references to the time, or talk about his previous life at all. That's unrealistic. You can't move from one culture to another and not want to talk about your life in the previous one. He's on a research ship, piloting a million dollar submarine by himself, but there is no mention how or why. Is he a botanist? An ocean researcher? Treasure explorer? What is he an expert in? If so, why doesn't he use any of his knowledge or talk about it? In the first episode, he's very clumsy with a sword, in the second he's an expert? Really?

It is positively not ""edgy"" and personally that is just fine by me as I am a bit tired of everything needing to be ""edgy"". Everyday life is edgy enough, I want to sit down  at days end and just relax and be entertained. ""Atlantis"" pleasantly provides just this opportunity.Filmed in Wales and Morocco, this is the story of a young (modern day) man named Jason who, in searching for his missing father, unexpectedly arrives on the shores of the not-so-lost city of Atlantis. It seems Jason has a destiny, and together with his new found friends Hercules & Pythagoras, this penniless trio sets out to solve mysteries (Jason's abilities, fate, and his missing father), overcome perilous tasks, perform good deeds and keep Hurcules fed.There is romance, action, humor, mystery and intrigue. From the palace to the underworld caves of Hades we are introduced weekly to many characters...a noble, slightly out-of-touch king, a scheming queen, a lovelorn princess, an ill-fated hand-maiden, and a mysterious oracle. Without overpowering the story, the show makes good use of CGI to render the occasional mythological (Minotaur, Witch, Desert Furies, Gorgon) creature. And let us not forget Pandora's box.The show has much to offer should you be looking for some fun, relaxing entertainment.

The adherence to the rich Greek mythology heritage is refreshing.

The scripts do have forced humor, but it is for a family audience, so that is understandable. That it respects its subject and tries to inform about the ancient world culture is a five star effort that only the 50's Jason and the Argonauts, Clash of the Titans, etc. has attempted.

1673336,A2ZRCNY3FVR4AI,B00FRQ0NYU,"Lucas Goldstein ""Luke Goldstein""","[0, 0]","One of our worst enemies in the realm of enjoying new television shows and movies is our own preconception. &#8220;This is going to be just like my other favorite show!&#8221; or &#8220;This is going to dark and moody like that other show!&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;ll never like this because it&#8217;s silly like those other shows.&#8221;Generating comparisons based on a commercial or even the first episode is dangerous because you run the risk of missing out on something far more rewarding than you imagined. Feeling my own preconception get bested by a new TV show is a fun bit of chagrin for me, showing it is not always a bad thing to be proven wrong.The BBC series Atlantis brings a new twist to the legendary lost city.In this version, Atlantis is home to not only its own legends, but also a flurry of Greek mythological heroes and monsters. The story surrounds Jason, who falls through a wormhole in time back to the ancient city and quickly befriends the famous duo of Hercules and Pythagoras (who never actually meet in the original tales). Jason is at the center of a dark and troubling prophecy, but he doesn&#8217;t understand his part and must decide how hard to fight to get away from it, while not risking the lives of the friends he meets along the way.After watching the first episode, I thought I had this show pegged. It&#8217;s the BBC version of Xena: Warrior Princess. There are jokes, some slapstick humor and fantastical action, which always seems to include lots of acrobatic flipping by the hero. I didn&#8217;t expect much more as it went along, but I found myself drawn in by the most simple of premises. Jason, played charmingly by Jack Donnelly, is the prototypical fish out of water, but his naivet&eacute; comes across as very genuine. A poignant and poetic side of the character evolves from his foreknowledge of events since some of the people he meets are part of the stories he was told as a kid in the future. When he is introduced a lovely lady by the name of Medusa, he sadly realizes her fate is already sealed, no matter how much he would want to change it. Watching him navigate those waters and balance his morality with so-called destiny is much better than your ordinary scifi/fantasy fare.The revisionist stories are also fun for those people who know the original stories; the show is full of mythological easter eggs just for you. The writers find more and more creative ways to drop in folks like King Midas, the Minotour, Pandora&#8217;s Box, and of course the historical significance of Hercules and Pythagoras. Jason&#8217;s two lovable sidekicks, the ancient version of Laurel and Hardy, provide much of the heart for the show. This version of Hercules shows a man past his prime and living off the legends of his past heroics, which more and more seem like fairy tales in themselves. He drinks too much, gambles too much, and takes too much advantage of those who care about him, but he is loyal to the end and proves to be there when he&#8217;s really needed. While Pythagoras is braver and more courageous than his thin frame belies, he uses his brain (and his love of science and triangles) to help his friends cheat death time and time again.The villains are numerous and they provide an endless series of hoops for Jason and his friends to jump through in order to stay alive and chase their dreams, which for Jason is the love of Atlantis&#8217; Princess Ariadne. Her place in the royal family and Jason&#8217;s place, or lack thereof, trots out the tried and true long lost lovers storyline. Yet the stories that surround our hero, including some which I won&#8217;t give away, keep the show multi-layered and full of possibilities.Atlantis is a fun show that is easy to pass off, but don&#8217;t make that mistake. It will get under your skin and soon enough you&#8217;ll find yourself cheering out loud for the talented trio of heroes.",4,"Campy at first, but proves to be much more",1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,3903,"['One', 'worst', 'enemies', 'realm', 'enjoying', 'new', 'television', 'shows', 'movies', 'own', 'preconception', '8220', 'going', 'be', 'just', 'other', 'favorite', 'show', '8221', '8220', 'going', 'dark', 'moody', 'other', 'show', '8221', '8220', '8217', 'never', '8217', 'silly', 'other', 'shows.', '8221', 'Generating', 'comparisons', 'based', 'commercial', 'even', 'first', 'episode', 'dangerous', 'run', 'risk', 'missing', 'out', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'rewarding', 'imagined', 'Feeling', 'own', 'preconception', 'get', 'bested', 'new', 'TV', 'show', 'fun', 'bit', 'chagrin', 'showing', 'not', 'always', 'bad', 'thing', 'be', 'proven', 'wrong.The', 'BBC', 'series', 'Atlantis', 'new', 'twist', 'legendary', 'lost', 'city.In', 'version', 'Atlantis', 'home', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'legends', 'also', 'flurry', 'Greek', 'mythological', 'heroes', 'monsters', 'story', 'Jason', 'who', 'wormhole', 'time', 'back', 'ancient', 'city', 'quickly', 'famous', 'duo', 'Hercules', 'Pythagoras', 'who', 'never', 'actually', 'meet', 'original', 'tales', 'Jason', 'center', 'dark', 'troubling', 'prophecy', '8217', 'understand', 'part', 'must', 'decide', 'how', 'hard', 'fight', 'get', 'away', 'not', 'risking', 'lives', 'friends', 'way.After', 'watching', 'first', 'episode', 'thought', 'had', 'show', 'pegged', '8217', 's', 'BBC', 'version', 'Xena', 'Warrior', 'Princess', 'are', 'jokes', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'fantastical', 'action', 'always', 'include', 'lots', 'acrobatic', 'flipping', 'hero', 'didn', '8217', 'expect', 'much', 'more', 'went', 'along', 'found', 'drawn', 'most', 'simple', 'premises', 'Jason', 'played', 'charmingly', 'Jack', 'Donnelly', 'prototypical', 'fish', 'water', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'very', 'genuine', 'poignant', 'poetic', 'side', 'character', 'foreknowledge', 'events', 'people', 'are', 'part', 'stories', 'was', 'told', 'kid', 'future', 'When', 'introduced', 'lovely', 'lady', 'name', 'Medusa', 'sadly', 'fate', 'already', 'sealed', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'would', 'want', 'change', 'Watching', 'navigate', 'waters', 'balance', 'morality', 'so-called', 'destiny', 'much', 'better', 'ordinary', 'scifi/fantasy', 'fare.The', 'revisionist', 'stories', 'are', 'also', 'fun', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'original', 'stories', 'show', 'full', 'mythological', 'easter', 'eggs', 'just', 'writers', 'find', 'more', 'more', 'creative', 'ways', 'drop', 'folks', 'King', 'Midas', 'Minotour', 'Pandora', '8217', 'Box', 'course', 'historical', 'significance', 'Hercules', 'Pythagoras', 'Jason', '8217', 'two', 'lovable', 'sidekicks', 'ancient', 'version', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'provide', 'much', 'heart', 'show', 'version', 'Hercules', 'man', 'prime', 'living', 'off', 'legends', 'past', 'heroics', 'more', 'more', 'seem', 'fairy', 'tales', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'advantage', 'who', 'care', 'loyal', 'end', 'be', 'there', 'when', '8217', 'really', 'needed', 'Pythagoras', 'braver', 'more', 'courageous', 'thin', 'frame', 'belies', 'brain', 'love', 'science', 'triangles', 'help', 'friends', 'cheat', 'death', 'time', 'time', 'again.The', 'villains', 'are', 'numerous', 'provide', 'endless', 'series', 'hoops', 'Jason', 'friends', 'jump', 'order', 'stay', 'alive', 'chase', 'dreams', 'Jason', 'love', 'Atlantis', '8217', 'Princess', 'Ariadne', 'place', 'royal', 'family', 'Jason', '8217', 's', 'place', 'lack', 'thereof', 'out', 'tried', 'true', 'long', 'lost', 'lovers', 'storyline', 'stories', 'surround', 'hero', 'including', 'won', '8217', 'give', 'away', 'keep', 'show', 'multi-layered', 'full', 'possibilities.Atlantis', 'fun', 'show', 'easy', 'pass', 'off', 'don', '8217', 'make', 'mistake', 'will', 'get', 'skin', 'soon', 'enough', '8217', 'find', 'cheering', 'out', 'loud', 'talented', 'trio', 'heroes']",N/A

1673342,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00FRQ0NYU,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[2, 2]","A young man arrives in a legendary city ruled over by a tyrannical monarch, where a mysterious prophet waits in an underground cavern, telling him of his great destiny as a future hero. Throw in a bromance, a rebellious princess, a few CGI beasties, and a new spin on familiar legends, and I've just described ""Atlantis"".I've also just describedMerlin. This not a coincidence, as both shows share the same producers, writers, directors, and occasionally the same actors. Even some of the sets and sound-effects are the same (fans of the earlier show will instantly recognise that the screams of the Furies are just like the Dorocha). It's pretty clear that this is an attempt to recapture the success of ""Merlin"", which for the record - isn't a bad thing. Heck, it's good business. The problem lies with the fact that the brains behind ""Atlantis"" seem to be almost comically misinformed about what made ""Merlin"" such a success. If anything, all they've done is recycle the *worst* components of its predecessor.Jason (Jack Donnelly) is a young man searching for his missing father, who takes a submarine down into the depths of the ocean, only to wake up some time later on the shores of a strange beach. He explores further and finds himself in Atlantis, ruled over by King Minos and Queen Pasiphae, and the beautiful Princess Ariadne. Soon enough he makes friends with Hercules and Pythagoras (Mark Addy and Robert Emms) and is told by the Oracle living in the Temple of Poseidon that he's been brought there for a reason - though she will not say what.Yet having established that Jason has apparently travelled back in time, this is never again brought up. If you were to start watching from the second episode (or even halfway through the first) you'd have no idea whatsoever that Jason was from the contemporary world. Did he just forget about it, along with the search for his father? We learn absolutely nothing about his life before coming to Atlantis: his mother, his friends, his job prospects, his hobbies - nothing. He's just a blank slate. Furthermore, he seems to have no problems whatsoever to acclimatizing to living in an ancient civilization. Does he miss hot running water? Electricity and medicine? Television and the internet? Apparently not, though as any fan ofSleepy Hollowcan tell you, there is a lot of fun to be found in fish out of water scenarios.Only occasionally does Jason demonstrate knowledge of the Greek myths that make up this world, though that only leads to another problem. See, the underlying premise of ""Merlin"" was that it was a prequel to Arthurian legends. This provided the writers for opportunities to explore elements of the familiar story in what could be quite clever ways (the creation of Excalibur, the origins of the Lady of the Lake, the forming of the Knights of the Round Table). You can tell that ""Atlantis"" is trying to do the same thing here by including such characters as Medusa and Odeipus, figures whose fates are already known to the audiences (and Jason).Yet the problem with this that unlike the Arthurian legends, which have a distinct beginning, middle and end, the diaspora of Greek myths are varied and largely unconnected to each other. The show comes across as somewhat random as a result, not helped by the fact that real historical figures such as Pythagoras exist alongside the mythological ones. So is Jason in the distant past? Or another dimension? Is this meant to be the ""true story"" behind the Greek myths that were distorted over time, or is it a completely different world where all bets are off? The show gives us no clue at all, and plays so fast and loose with the content of the Greek myths that it's impossible to figure it out.The characters are likeable enough, but not hugely interesting. You could probably remove Pythagoras from the show entirely without it having much effect on the overarching storylines, and though the presence of the famous mathematician and philosopher should lead to scenes of lateral problem-solving or thinking outside the box, he's really just there to be the mildly geeky sidekick. You could count the number of times he mentions triangles on one hand, and his interest in them is just used for a running gag anyway. Meanwhile Mark Addy plays his usual role as the loud, boisterous, drunken womanizer. Here Hercules is characterized as a man whose reputation is wildly exaggerated in order to cover for his gambling, drinking and womanizing ways - you'll either find this amusing or tedious, but given that Addy is given first-billing, he ends up dominating the show, even to the detriment of Jason.Then there's the female characters. These show-runners were notoriously bad at doing right by the women in ""Merlin"", whose female characters came in three flavours: evil witches, distressed damsels, and dead plot-devices. In five years I think there was only one exception to this rule, and the trend continues well into ""Atlantis"". Evil Queen? Check. Evil Witch? Check. Evil Cult of Evil Priestesses? Check. Of our two main female characters Princess Ariadne is given virtually nothing to do expect stare at Jason and exchange snarky comments with her stepmother, and though Medusa is afforded a little agency at first, she's soon relegated to hostage, victim, and love interest to a man who used an enchantment to brainwash her into loving him. She'll no doubt go the way of Morgana: sweet and kind at first, only to become evil off-screen without any warning. Oh, and take a shot every time a woman gets drugged or enchanted against her will. These writers *love* that one.Edit: in a late episode, they do finally manage to introduce a female character who breaks the mould: one who is capable, benevolent and survives the episode. I was genuinely astonished.In the interests of fairness, the production values of the show are very high, with above-average sets, costumes, and CGI. Much of the show was filmed on-location in Morocco, and the actors are likeable enough. Sarah Parish in particular plays the role of evil queen with panache, and many of the guest stars are familiar British thespians who've turned up for a bit of fun.But if you think I'm being unfair by comparing it to ""Merlin"", that's simply because it tries to replicate so many of its predecessors' components that it's almost impossible to judge it on its own merits. Perhaps if I hadn't been aware of the production team behind it - but I was, and thus the similarities are obvious. There's lots of shirtlessness, a slew of fat jokes, a lack of continuity, and plenty of plot holes (how exactly did Jason become a master swordsman overnight?) Also, is Atlantis even an island? The characters cross deserts and visit other large cities, giving no indication whatsoever that the city of Atlantis, famed for sinking below the waves, is in any way surrounded by the ocean.Basically, it's a diverting enough show for youngsters (though your daughters deserve much better representation than this) and popular enough to be renewed for at least one more series. As light fluff it's enjoyable enough, but if you want a higher quality BBC period drama/adventure series for the whole family, then definitely check out their latest rendition ofThe Musketeersinstead. It's better in every respect.",3,"""You Have a Great Destiny...""",1396224000,"03 31, 2014",2014,7280,"['young', 'man', 'legendary', 'city', 'ruled', 'over', 'tyrannical', 'monarch', 'where',
