And while that is happening, the replay pertaining runs.These dancers are NOT like the Dancing with The Stars Hasbeens who have never danced in their life.  These people are authentic dancers, and that is where this show becomes entertainment and not a joke.Hot Tamale Train-Mary!The judges are excellent, except you can take only so much of the screaming, yelping, yapping, Hot Tamale Train-Mary! But aside from that she provides good criticism.  And what I like about the judges is that they were past dancers/choreographers.  They know their craft.Dance NumbersThese young dancers have toned bodies, excellent dance lines, experience, grace, style, etc.  They perform to music we know and like.  And they are under the instruction of famed choreographers, which is a huge contribution.  The dance numbers are amazing!  Some are just so beautiful you just gaze at every step they take, every move they make, every breath they take...oooops, wrong song!!Versatility and VarietyWith a range of styles the choreographers bring, we get to see all styles of dance, jazz, ballroom, crimp, hip hop, waltz, contemporary, etc., etc.  What a showcase of dance styles, costumes, hairstyles and routines.Professional Dance Groups and Entertainers too!What I really like is that some speciality groups dance, or the cast does fantastic group dances.  The musical entertainers enhance the show.Can't wait for more....Rizzo",5,As Nigel said....THIS  is the real number one dancing show!,1214438400,"06 26, 2008",2008,1541,"['wonderful', 'entertainment', 'viewer', 'get', 'learn', 'dance', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'praise', 'critcism', 'happening', 'replay', 'pertaining', 'runs.These', 'dancers', 'are', 'NOT', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'Hasbeens', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'danced', 'life', 'people', 'are', 'authentic', 'dancers', 'where', 'show', 'entertainment', 'not', 'joke.Hot', 'Tamale', 'Train-Mary', 'judges', 'are', 'excellent', 'can', 'take', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'screaming', 'yelping', 'yapping', 'Hot', 'Tamale', 'Train-Mary', 'aside', 'good', 'criticism', 'what', 'like', 'judges', 'were', 'past', 'dancers/choreographers', 'know', 'craft.Dance', 'NumbersThese', 'young', 'dancers', 'have', 'toned', 'bodies', 'excellent', 'dance', 'lines', 'experience', 'grace', 'style', 'etc', 'perform', 'music', 'know', 'are', 'instruction', 'famed', 'choreographers', 'huge', 'contribution', 'dance', 'numbers', 'are', 'amazing', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'beautiful', 'just', 'gaze', 'step', 'take', 'move', 'make', 'breath', 'take', 'oooops', 'wrong', 'song', 'Versatility', 'VarietyWith', 'range', 'styles', 'choreographers', 'bring', 'get', 'see', 'styles', 'dance', 'jazz', 'ballroom', 'crimp', 'hip', 'hop', 'waltz', 'contemporary', 'etc.', 'etc', 'What', 'showcase', 'dance', 'styles', 'costumes', 'hairstyles', 'routines.Professional', 'Dance', 'Groups', 'Entertainers', 'too', 'What', 'really', 'like', 'speciality', 'groups', 'dance', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'group', 'dances', 'musical', 'entertainers', 'enhance', 'show.Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'more', '.Rizzo']",So You Think You Can Dance
1162003,A1VBWYIOZQQIDQ,B00198X0YU,"Alan Montgomery ""Opera lover""","[0, 0]","the only reason I can see for not releasing this show, season by season, to DVD is that the accompaniment to each dance is from copyrighted material and they might have trouble getting clearance.  But WOW, the dancing on this show is as spectacular as it comes.  Take the season just ending.  Three young people, aged 18 and 19, did some amazing dancing, and the rest of the cast was close behind.  Okay, I think Kent or Rob should have won, but that's beside the point.  I would include the dancing only, except where an explanation of the content might help.  But the choreography does not go easy just because they are young dancers.  Forget some of the junk dancing you see in videos.  This is the real stuff, and hometowns are justifiably proud when their native sons or daughters get into the final 4 or 5.I've been DVD-ing the final two shows for three seasons, and it makes for wonderful viewing.  Come on, Fox, give us this show, season by season, on DVD.

1162006,A17VUWG0UV6Z2R,B00198X0YU,"Dudley Ristow ""books4me""","[1, 2]","Hands down this is the best TV talent show ever !Whilst the scope of possible winners (Joshua, Katee, Twitch, Will) was the greatest in Season 4; for me, whilst not wishing to take anything from Sabra, the best dancer of all the seasons was Danny.  It used to nark me no end whenever the judges harped on his withdrawn personality - so big deal who wanted him to do an Oprah on the show anyway ?  His moves did the talking !Review edit : Season 6 has just finished showing in my country - S Africa.  What stars were both Jakob and Russell?  But then I went back to Season 4 which just made me realize its unfair to compare seasons since truly each season is special in its own way.From Season 2 I pvr'ed every program and then program by program I edited every dance onto video - only including auditions if they were really expectional, (so often these don't make it to the final round) omitting ads, needless chit-chat, choreo sessions and even judges' feedback until the final 10 - which I then had burnt onto DVDs and even if I say so myself, I have done both the series and myself proud - its like watching a live show that flows from one great dance to the next.  What collector's items have I got here!When life gets a little too hectic and i am down in the dumps the viewing of these DVDs just makes my spirits soar again.  Anyone interested in inheriting the collection one day?  LOLHope the idea to change the format to only 10 dancers who will dance with an all star partner (dancers from previous seasons)with only one dancer at a time being eliminated is not going to change the magic of this series.",5,Pure magic ......,1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,1613,"['down', 'best', 'TV', 'talent', 'show', 'ever', 'scope', 'possible', 'winners', 'Joshua', 'Katee', 'Twitch', 'Will', 'was', 'greatest', 'Season', '4', 'not', 'wishing', 'take', 'anything', 'Sabra', 'best', 'dancer', 'seasons', 'was', 'Danny', 'used', 'nark', 'end', 'whenever', 'judges', 'harped', 'withdrawn', 'personality', 'so', 'big', 'deal', 'who', 'wanted', 'do', 'Oprah', 'show', 'anyway', 'moves', 'did', 'talking', 'Review', 'edit', 'Season', '6', 'just', 'finished', 'showing', 'country', 'S', 'Africa', 'What', 'were', 'Jakob', 'Russell', 'then', 'went', 'back', 'Season', '4', 'just', 'made', 'realize', 'unfair', 'compare', 'seasons', 'truly', 'season', 'special', 'own', 'way.From', 'Season', '2', ""pvr'ed"", 'program', 'then', 'program', 'program', 'edited', 'dance', 'video', 'only', 'including', 'auditions', 'were', 'really', 'expectional', 'so', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'final', 'round', 'omitting', 'ads', 'needless', 'chit-chat', 'choreo', 'sessions', 'even', 'judges', 'feedback', 'final', '10', 'then', 'had', 'burnt', 'DVDs', 'even', 'say', 'so', 'have', 'done', 'series', 'proud', 'watching', 'live', 'show', 'one', 'great', 'dance', 'next', 'What', 'collector', 'items', 'have', 'got', 'here', 'When', 'life', 'little', 'too', 'hectic', 'i', 'am', 'down', 'dumps', 'viewing', 'DVDs', 'just', 'spirits', 'soar', 'again', 'Anyone', 'interested', 'inheriting', 'collection', 'one', 'day', 'LOLHope', 'idea', 'change', 'format', 'only', '10', 'dancers', 'who', 'will', 'dance', 'star', 'partner', 'dancers', 'previous', 'seasons', 'only', 'one', 'dancer', 'time', 'being', 'eliminated', 'not', 'going', 'change', 'magic', 'series']",So You Think You Can Dance
