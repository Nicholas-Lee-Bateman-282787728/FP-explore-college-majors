1459100,AIEEK7AHXKZCC,B005FPT2E0,BeatleBangs1964,"[12, 16]","""Here comes the sun....the smile's returning to their faces."" -- George Harrison, 1969""I want to tell you, my head is filled with things to say."" -- George Harrison, 1966This is the documentary Beatle fans and George Harrison fans have prayed for and long awaited!  As others have noted, I, too could have happily watched both installments at one time.  Seeing it broken into 2 separate parts had an advantage in that it gave me something to look forward to wataching.  This is a brilliant work covering the life and artwork of George Harrison, artist extraordinaire in his multi-faceted glory.I've said all along that George was all about love.  From the time George made his presence known and felt; from the time he was placed in the loving arms of Louise French Harrison and she saw her own intensity looking back at her; from the time Harold Sr. first set eyes on George and his only sister and two older brothers welcomed this ""new little Harrison,"" as Louise French Harrison would later describe George and other new arrivals (nieces, nephews and grandchildren) with much love.  Harold Sr. and Louise French were from all accounts a very loving couple who were nuturing to their 4 children.  George, surrounded by love from the beginning would live full circle by making a final request that people ""love one another.""This documentary portrays the REAL George Harrison and does not degenerate into idolatry.  George is shown in many moods, some less than cheery and shown warts, wrinkles, atrocious perm days and all.George's fellow Wilburys and former Beatle bandmate Paul McCartney and wife Olivia provide the best interviews. I just wish more Harrison family members had been a part of this stellar documentary.  George's sister, also named Louise has banged on the drum for her brother for many years.  In fact, George was the first Beatle to cross the Atlantic, coming to America in 1963 to visit his only sister.Most, if not all Harrison fans find George's view of religions very interesting.  It has been documented that Louise French Harrison, herself Catholic had George baptized in March of 1943 when he was 1 month old.  In 1965 George and Ravi Shankar met and during that time, George introduced the world at large to Eastern music and was exploring his philosophies and religious expression.  His Catholic roots never left him; a lovely statue of Mother Mary graced his property at Friar Park.Louise, George's only sister would say in an early April 2011 interview that it was a shock to her to discover that the ""real world"" wasn't as honest as Harold Sr. and Louise French were and not everybody lived up to their high standard of honesty.  George too lived by that credo and he took things to heart deeply and passionately.George was also fun. He liked cool cars and was an avid Formula One Fan.  His sister had a serious Dodge Dart when he first came to visit her in 1963 when she was living in Benton, Illinois.  He had a brilliant, dry, droll wit. He loved nature and demonstrated a very nurturing side, which was a Louise French trait.  His passion for gardening was a gift from Harold Sr. and Louise French.  George was an intensely curious and interested person, seeking information and trying to make sense out of the world in which he lived.George had beautiful wavy hair, courtesy of Harold Sr.; the deep-set Harold Sr. eyes, but he had the burning Louise intensity that never once left his eyes. Pictures of George as an infant and as a very young child show his ubiquitous intensity, which never left him at any time.  It could be a tad unnerving to see such intensity radiating from one so young.  It was a trait that never left him.  George resembled Harold Sr. from the eyes up.  From the nose down, he was Louise French Harrison all over again and his brother Peter was almost a double of Harold Sr.!  Harold Jr. looked more French than Harrison; he and George inherited their maternal grandfather's tall, lean frame.  Lou was a Franco-Harrison creation as was George.  You get to appreciate these things all the more in the book AND in the documentary.  Paul McCartney even says in the book that George had a lot of Louise French's character and personality in him.  Louise definitely left her stamp on George!  Louise even said in the newsletter that she always thought George looked like her dad, John French Sr.)Louise French Harrison lent her voice to the George Harrison Official Fan Club Newsletter from 1965-1969.  It is plain that Louise loved George and his siblings and in her column, each Harrison child is included and given his or her place under Here Comes the Sun.Olivia is a beautiful gracious lady and she discusses her life with George and some of the road bumps they hit along the way.  She does so with grace, tact and aplomb. At no time does she resort to tawdry tale-bearing and finger pointing.  Despite all they had been through together, they raised a good son and Olivia loved George, warts, problems, atrocious perms, infidelity and all.  Dhani, their son resembles George and his maternal grandmother who unfortunately died 8 years before he was born.  Clearly George and Olivia loved and cared about each other and again, to Olivia's credit, she is tactful and discreet when certain questions crop up. That reflects well on her and speaks to good.Readers walk the Long & Winding Road with George from his early days until his untimely death in 2001.  I love the way George could see humor in himself AND his fellow Beatles, as evidenced in his laughing at a Beatle video.  The interviews make a good thing even better and I thank the kind person who made it possible for me to watch this until I am able to buy this dvd.George Harrison has given the gift of his beautiful voice to many.  I knew a child with Asperger's Syndrome, which is a form of autism.  She was a MAJOR Beatles fan and George was her favorite.  This child, like so many children with autism spectrum issues was a late talker.  Once she acquired speech and an awareness of music, she found her voice in the Beatles.  She would let George ""talk"" for her in that she would quote Harrison lyrics and lyrics from Beatle songs to get a point/message across.  This later segued into richer, developed speech.  As I said about the book, George Harrison's music and his natural, yet childlike grace of sorts reached countless many. He has a large following of fans with autism, as do the Beatles as a group. Beatle fans with autism is a demographic that is not at all rare or unusual.George's humor comes through time and again.  His sardonic wit after that crackpot broke into his home at the tail end of 1999 was evidenced when he said in re the crackpot: ""well, he sure wasn't auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys.""  He had made peace with his life; he was surrounded by love every step of the way.  George during his post-1999 brush with death had a very peaceful and serene look about him; his eyes, always intense like those of Louise French Harrison included an inner peace, like his 1968 song ""The Inner Light.""  He disclosed his peace and the fact that he was ready to let go to Olivia, who bore this with dignity and grace.A beautiful tribute to George and how meaningful his life has been in the eyes of those who knew him and others who love his art/music.  George has brought more people closer to God. In fact, my church, which is a Catholic church uses George songs, some of which like ""Dear One"" are beautiful prayers set to  music for our prayer meetings, Bible studes and discussion groups.  George is, as we say ""a parishioner by proxy"" because his beautiful music and his open heart and mind have set a good example to countless people.Bless George, George's family and all who have traveled down the Long & Winding Road with George.You will also want to readBefore He Was Fab : George Harrison's First American Visit, which was co-authored by George's sister, Louise.",5,The Inner

1459101,AJWQ0YLZ5U8GD,B005FPT2E0,Bernardo,"[1, 1]","I have always been interested and curious about George Harrison, being aware of his talent eclipsed by John and Paul while part of The Beattles. I also knew of his interest in Eastern spirituality but never really found out more about it. This film answers those questions and more. This documentary is extraordinary; of course, what else could we expect of Martin Scorsese!The film documents, primarily based on the archives kept and life experiences shared by his wife Olivia, George's life from early infancy until his departure from this material existence. Along the way the viewer is treated to very rare photographs, intimate interviews with the many people who George deeply touched during this soujourn, home movies, and rare interview footage. We get to see various aspects and facets of the man: his wit, humor, charity, creativity, innovativeness, seriousness, perseverance, compassion, and depth. We also get an inkling about his vulnerabilities, though only by vague mention, his anger and weakness for the ladies, aspects only mentioned, very briefly, by his wife of thirty years, and Paul McCartney, probably to not take away the focus off the remarkable elements of George's life.We also catch sight of his discontent with aspects of the 60's revolution, which, instead of being a mind expansion leading to greater achievements in humanity, it became a regression into useless and self satifying materialism. We also witness his work for the Concert for Bangla Desh, the first rock concert ever organized for charitable purposes and the greatest gathering of prominent artists since Woodstock, and his close involvement in film production with the Monty Python crew -George even morgaged his house so the Python's could produce the Life of Brian.We see George as a musician, a collaborator, a creater, a spouse, a friend, a mystic, and a cool father. You may even have a tear pour out at some point, as Ringo does when he recalls the last words he heard from his friend shortly before disincarnating.",5,A peak into the soul of the man,1332028800,"03 18, 2012",2012,2017,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'interested', 'curious', 'George', 'Harrison', 'being', 'aware', 'talent', 'eclipsed', 'John', 'Paul', 'part', 'Beattles', 'also', 'knew', 'interest', 'Eastern', 'spirituality', 'never', 'really', 'found', 'out', 'more', 'film', 'answers', 'questions', 'more', 'documentary', 'extraordinary', 'course', 'what', 'else', 'could', 'expect', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'film', 'documents', 'primarily', 'based', 'archives', 'kept', 'life', 'experiences', 'shared', 'wife', 'Olivia', 'George', 'life', 'early', 'infancy', 'departure', 'material', 'existence', 'way', 'viewer', 'treated', 'very', 'rare', 'photographs', 'intimate', 'interviews', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'George', 'deeply', 'touched', 'soujourn', 'home', 'movies', 'rare', 'interview', 'footage', 'get', 'see', 'various', 'aspects', 'facets', 'man', 'wit', 'humor', 'charity', 'creativity', 'innovativeness', 'seriousness', 'perseverance', 'compassion', 'depth', 'also', 'get', 'inkling', 'vulnerabilities', 'only', 'vague', 'mention', 'anger', 'weakness', 'ladies', 'only', 'mentioned', 'very', 'briefly', 'wife', 'thirty', 'years', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'probably', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'focus', 'remarkable', 'elements', 'George', 'life.We', 'also', 'catch', 'sight', 'discontent', 'aspects', '60', 'revolution', 'instead', 'being', 'mind', 'expansion', 'leading', 'greater', 'achievements', 'humanity', 'became', 'regression', 'useless', 'self', 'satifying', 'materialism', 'also', 'witness', 'work', 'Concert', 'Bangla', 'Desh', 'first', 'rock', 'concert', 'ever', 'organized', 'charitable', 'purposes', 'greatest', 'gathering', 'prominent', 'artists', 'Woodstock', 'close', 'involvement', 'film', 'production', 'Monty', 'Python', 'crew', '-George', 'even', 'morgaged', 'house', 'Python', 'could', 'produce', 'Life', 'Brian.We', 'see', 'George', 'musician', 'collaborator', 'creater', 'spouse', 'friend', 'mystic', 'cool', 'father', 'may', 'even', 'have', 'tear', 'pour', 'out', 'point', 'Ringo', 'when', 'last', 'words', 'heard', 'friend', 'shortly', 'disincarnating']",George Harrison - Living in the Material World
1459102,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,B005FPT2E0,Carlisle Wheeling,"[106, 108]","I just finished watching this on cable over the span of the last two days, parts 1 and 2, but as far as I'm concerned they could have run the entire documentary in one day, and I would have sat through the entire 5-hour uminterrupted run.  A nicely done biography courtesy of Martin Scorsese on the life, music, and personality of ""the quiet Beatle.""  Although some of the editing was a bit choppy on some of the musical footage, I found the biography to be a fascinating look into a performer I didn't really know about as much as I thought I did.One thing you come away with is that George, in his aspiration to spread love, was greatly loved in return by friends and family for a lot of obvious reasons.  What was really nice to see is that he was accepted with his moody side as well, something lots of people look at in others first, disregarding the rest.  Of all the people interviewed for commentary, the most inciteful ones seemed to be Eric Clapton, Tom Petty, and wife Olivia.George's religious philosophy and world views may not necessarily be eye to eye with your own, but anyone who is trying to make a difference in the lives of the lesser off and is a true advocate for positive change is a good icon for the world at large.  Apparently the quiet Beatle had a gift for reaching out and opening people's minds at a one-on-one level, though not good at delivering speeches in front of thousands.  He was obviously very personable, candid, and passionate about the things that he believed in.  That passion--or any--can make an orator out of a mute.  Funny how one of the most telling things about him was his eyes!  You can see the depths of his emotions constantly, and maybe the weight of the world was something he placed too firmly on his own shoulders.  You would be moody too!In contrast, we see he had a very playful side, loved mischief, and got simple joy out of colors, flowers, and close friendships.  Unfortunately, the mischief veered into unfortunate territory for the main women in his life, and Olivia makes it plain in what she says about him--or, rather, what she DOESN'T say.  ""The key to a long marriage...Don't get divorced,"" speaks volumes on her thoughts about his quirks and aberrant behavior.  She was trying to be graceful without giving details, but not too many people appreciate infidelity.  Was he a good husband?  Well, it's very obvious she loved him, which covers up a multitude of foibles.  Was he a good father?  It certainly looked like it to me, because Dhani seems to be a good kid, and boy, he sure looks a lot like his dad!  Was he a good friend?  Undoubtedly.  Was he a great spiritualist?  He tried his hardest with lots of success.  Was he a great musician?  Ringing affirmative!Moments that stand out in the film:George standing protectively by John's side after Stu Sutcliffe passed away while Astrid shot their photos.George laughing and singing along to ""This Boy"" while viewing an old Beatle performance.Eric Clapton's recounting the entire Patty Boyd situation.The wonderful footage of that huge, sprawling mansion.All the interviews with Tom Petty, from the funny ukelele story to his recounting of George's post Orbison death comment:  ""Aren't you glad it's not you?""  Well, at least he was bold enough to say what most people are thinking anyway.The music footage, of course, and getting to see nearly everyone who was anybody in it!The most touching part for me was after that lunatic broke into the estate, nearly killing George and Olivia, forcing them to have to fight back.  The results of the attack seemed to bring out the best thing for George in his preparation for death:  closure.  His telling Olivia that he finally figured out he really had to let go of all his bitterness and be more forgiving made me want to take stock in the way I've been conducting my own life, and maybe it's time to be more spiritual myself.  No matter what your faith is, forgiveness can do wonderful things--well, I've generally seen it in other people.To sum it up, this was an excellent account of George's life because it didn't put him on a sugary pedestal.

My only complaint is that it covered The Beatles years far too long and went through the solo years too fast. The film shows throughout how George felt spiritual belief was becoming far more important then chart success (if it covered his Cloud 9 period you would have seen he really enjoyed chart success). Then again it we don't see as much of what he liked in the material sense as much as the title of the films name (and title of his second album by the way). The Beatles portion was a ""5"" but gave it a ""4"" due to the fact it skipped over his solo career too fast. It covers ""All Things Must Pass"" well, skims over the rest of his solo work. Maybe it was a time restraint, nevertheless I would recommend it to anyone wondering how good George became at the close of The Beatles break-up. Back to the material world vs the spiritual world. A lot was put on the religious beliefs etc but skimmed over what material things he loved. It did mention racing but maybe it was because he was fortunate to have had money to do things and looked into the things money could not buy.

It will take you back to the fabled ""1960's"" and everybody needs to re-visit those times, including people like me who remember it well, and also people never part of it, or who were there but left it when the calendar changed and ""modern times"" after the ""60's"" started up and continued to the present (2012).The famous movie titled ""My Dinner With Andre"" (1981) asked the important question ""What if the '60's were the best years ever to have happened, and it's been all down hill after that?"" Worth thinking about! The ""'60's"" were a highlight in human history of great importance, a benchmark of cultural and human excellence.They somehow got disappeared, and more to the sad point, never properly or adequately explained or communicated after the times changed, and glory of the '60's died.George Harrison was an icon of the 1960's, and his life after the '60's was devoted to ideals part of the high water mark times of the '60's.....and we see his important life in this wonderful documentary movie.....created in 2011 by Martin Scorcese.Scorcese attended NYU Film School in the mid-1960's and was a senior camera crew tech guy for the ""Woodstock"" (1969) documentary when Scorcese was still in his 20's. He was there for all of it, and never forgot it.""George Harrison: Living In The Material World"" (2011) is a memorial to the whole decade as well as to Mr. Harrison who was and is a remarkably representative person part of the 1960's.You had to be there to understand it, and remember it.No adequate documentary or other cinema art work effort ever came near to communicating what the 1960's were all about, why they were so important, and truly different than times before or since.....not until this documentary.See it, and you'll see the 1960's ideals and way of life, mentality.....so important and beautiful and worth preserving and studying.The 1960's were more than ""flower power"" and ""social protest"" times and events......those years, for some people, were a way of life never to be forgotten or abandoned.Yet, they are hard to describe......memories supported by visual and sound images need to be presented about the 1960's.This documentary is the very best effort doing that...succeeds as no other documentary about those times has ever done, to my thinking.You'll ""feel"" the 1960's........if you screen this documentary movie....and that's a worthwhile experience...one worth repeating often until you ""get the point"" and then start working to bring it back...somehow.-----------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG actor.",5,"""George Harrison"" (2011) documentary it the best ""trip"" back to the 1960's era mentality Harrison never abandoned!",1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,2775,"['George', 'Harrison', '2011', 'documentary', 'best', 'trip', 'back', '1960', 'era', 'mentality', 'Harrison', 'never', 'abandoned', 'See', ""'ll"", 'experience', '60', 'noblest', 'era', 'modern', 'times', 'See', 'noble', 'documentary', 'Marin', 'Scorcese', 'will', 'take', 'back', 'fabled', '1960', 'everybody', 're-visit', 'times', 'including', 'people', 'who', 'remember', 'well', 'also', 'people', 'never', 'part', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'left', 'when', 'calendar', 'changed', 'modern', 'times', '60', 'started', 'up', 'continued', 'present', '2012', '.The', 'famous', 'movie', 'titled', 'Dinner', 'Andre', '1981', 'asked', 'important', 'question', 'What', ""'60"", 'were', 'best', 'years', 'ever', 'have', 'happened', 'been', 'down', 'hill', 'thinking', ""'60"", 'were', 'highlight', 'human', 'history', 'great', 'importance', 'benchmark', 'cultural', 'human', 'excellence.They', 'somehow', 'got', 'disappeared', 'more', 'sad', 'point', 'never', 'properly', 'adequately', 'explained', 'communicated', 'times', 'changed', 'glory', ""'60"", 'died.George', 'Harrison', 'was', 'icon', '1960', 'life', ""'60"", 'was', 'devoted', 'ideals', 'part', 'high', 'water', 'mark', 'times', ""'60"", '..and', 'see', 'important', 'life', 'wonderful', 'documentary', 'movie', '..created', '2011', 'Martin', 'Scorcese.Scorcese', 'attended', 'NYU', 'Film', 'School', 'mid-1960', 'was', 'senior', 'camera', 'crew', 'tech', 'guy', 'Woodstock', '1969', 'documentary', 'when', 'Scorcese', 'was', 'still', '20', 'was', 'there', 'never', 'forgot', 'George', 'Harrison', 'Living', 'Material', 'World', '2011', 'memorial', 'whole', 'decade', 'as', 'well', 'Mr.', 'Harrison', 'who', 'was', 'remarkably', 'representative', 'person', 'part', ""1960's.You"", 'had', 'be', 'there', 'understand', 'remember', 'it.No', 'adequate', 'documentary', 'other', 'cinema', 'art', 'work', 'effort', 'ever', 'came', 'communicating', 'what', '1960', 'were', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'important', 'truly', 'different', 'times', '..not', 'documentary.See', ""'ll"", 'see', '1960', 'ideals', 'way', 'life', 'mentality', '..so', 'important', 'beautiful', 'worth', 'preserving', 'studying.The', '1960', 'were', 'more', 'flower', 'power', 'social', 'protest', 'times', 'events', 'years', 'people', 'were', 'way', 'life', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'abandoned.Yet', 'are', 'hard', 'describe', 'memories', 'supported', 'visual', 'sound', 'images', 'need', 'be', 'presented', ""1960's.This"", 'documentary', 'very', 'best', 'effort', 'doing', 'other', 'documentary', 'times', 'ever', 'done', 'thinking.You', ""'ll"", 'feel', '1960', 'screen', 'documentary', 'movie', '.and', 'worthwhile', 'experience', 'one', 'worth', 'repeating', 'often', 'get', 'point', 'then', 'start', 'working', 'bring', 'back', 'somehow.', '-Written', 'Tex', 'Allen', 'SAG', 'actor']",George Harrison - Living in the Material World

But it is also so much more than just that. You will absolutely learn more than you thought you knew about George Harrison. Surely The Beatles and their respective members have been chronicled extensively in several mediums from books, television, films, radio and a huge catalogue of YouTube programs and videos. The coverage of the history of the Liverpool band is staggering. And that's why LITMW is such a joy to watch. You learn about George's extraordinary life through the voices of his many close friends like surviving Beatle band mates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, Beatle's producer George Martin, close friend legendary guitarist Eric Clapton, Eric Idle, Jackie Stewart, Tom Petty, Ravi Shankar, Ray Cooper, Terry Gilliam, Yoko Ono, and many others including his brothers Harry and Pete, ex-wife Patty Boyd and his son Dhani and widow Olivia.They paint a picture of a man far more talented, powerful, spiritual, and accomplished then some might give George credit. And yet the endearing quality about all the reminiscences by his friends and family is how vitally important and good having George was in all their lives and the profound impact he had on all his family and friends. In the end, we get a more complete, more endearing, more human portrait of George than we have ever seen before. And a look inside what drove the man and his massive talent, whether it was music, films, gardening, racing cars, or the spiritual journey he took from being an icon of popular music to being a man at one with God. It chronicles his search for the spiritual understanding of the purpose of his life and the sometimes elusive peace of mind he sought for himself and the world around him.A brilliant, warm, touching, humorous, engaging and all together entertaining presentation worthy of Martin Scorsese's unparalleled ability as a unique storyteller.",5,Scorsese scores big with George Harrison documentary,1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,2113,"['Knowing', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'track', 'record', 'music', 'documentaries', 'Band', 'Last', 'Waltz', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Shine', 'Light', 'wonder', 'Living', 'Material', 'World', 'well', 'done', 'thoughtful', 'review', 'life', 'Quiet', 'Beatle', 'also', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'will', 'absolutely', 'learn', 'more', 'thought', 'knew', 'George', 'Harrison', 'Surely', 'Beatles', 'respective', 'members', 'have', 'been', 'chronicled', 'extensively', 'several', 'mediums', 'books', 'television', 'films', 'radio', 'huge', 'catalogue', 'YouTube', 'programs', 'videos', 'coverage', 'history', 'Liverpool', 'band', 'staggering', 'why', 'LITMW', 'such', 'joy', 'watch', 'learn', 'George', 'extraordinary', 'life', 'voices', 'many', 'close', 'friends', 'surviving', 'Beatle', 'band', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Ringo', 'Starr', 'Beatle', 'producer', 'George', 'Martin', 'close', 'friend', 'legendary', 'guitarist', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Eric', 'Idle', 'Jackie', 'Stewart', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Ravi', 'Shankar', 'Ray', 'Cooper', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'many', 'others', 'including', 'brothers', 'Harry', 'Pete', 'ex-wife', 'Patty', 'Boyd', 'son', 'Dhani', 'widow', 'Olivia.They', 'paint', 'picture', 'man', 'far', 'more', 'talented', 'powerful', 'spiritual', 'accomplished', 'then', 'might', 'give', 'George', 'credit', 'yet', 'endearing', 'quality', 'reminiscences', 'friends', 'family', 'how', 'vitally', 'important', 'good', 'having', 'George', 'was', 'lives', 'profound', 'impact', 'had', 'family', 'friends', 'end', 'get', 'more', 'complete', 'more', 'endearing', 'more', 'human', 'portrait', 'George', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'look', 'what', 'drove', 'man', 'massive', 'talent', 'was', 'music', 'films', 'gardening', 'racing', 'cars', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'took', 'being', 'icon', 'popular', 'music', 'being', 'man', 'one', 'God', 'search', 'spiritual', 'understanding', 'purpose', 'life', 'sometimes', 'elusive', 'peace', 'mind', 'sought', 'world', 'him.A', 'brilliant', 'warm', 'touching', 'humorous', 'engaging', 'together', 'entertaining', 'presentation', 'worthy', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'unparalleled', 'ability', 'unique', 'storyteller']",George Harrison - Living in the Material World

While I understand why people will like to have more ""just George after the Beatles"" footage I also understand that even though Beatles always try to under play being a ""Beatle"" that was most likely the most important thing that happened in their lives. George is not a stranger to that feeling. It is true that all of that has been well documented before but that happened and was paramount in his life and also in the others Beatles lives. I enjoyed a lot the part that shows his other interests such as car racing, movies (Life of Brian an episode that I did not know), and his relationship with other great musicians such as Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Jeff Lynne, etc. That was a nice addition.In my opinion the documental was candid and very well presented the facts.  They did not try to portrait him like a saint. It was kind of hard to hear his own wife talking about his weakness for ladies something that others have reported but not in such a personal way like Olivia Harrison did. I think they did a great job in that part.I enjoyed the documental and I recommend it to George's or Beatles fans. If you are not a Beatle fan I am afraid that you could get a little bit bored I wasn't. Still it is a nice historical perspective. The music we have today definitively had its rots and influences in the music from that time.George Harrison always has been my favorite Beatle because while the others wrote, sang and played songs about peace/love George Actually took action in the Bangladesh concert to help people tormented by natural disasters and give them some relief and hope. In that regard he was a pioneer as well it was the first time that an artist got together with a plethora of stars for a good cause. If you notice Paul was not there and I read somewhere that John wanted that Yoko was in the stage after Harrison's refusal Lennon opted out.....None of that was also included in the part that talks about the Bangladesh concert.The fact that he has such close relationship with Eric Clapton drove me back to the times of the great impressionist painters that know each other such as Degas, Cezanne, Monet, Manet, or Paul Gauguin friendship with Vincent Van Gogh. History usually sends us those geniuses in groups....Harrison definitively was the more ""spiritual"" of the four the fact that he needed to cope with some frustrations and sometimes shows  a kind of erratic behavior with great swings between vicious words and gentle actions puts him in a level that the rest of us can understand, relate and identify and of course love/admire him even more.",5,Beatles fans or George's fan you will love it.,1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,2691,"['took', 'time', 'read', 'almost', 'reviews', 'certainly', 'feeling', 'shock', 'surprise', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'will', 'like', 'have', 'more', 'just', 'George', 'Beatles', 'footage', 'also', 'understand', 'even', 'Beatles', 'always', 'try', 'play', 'being', 'Beatle', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'happened', 'lives', 'George', 'not', 'stranger', 'feeling', 'true', 'been', 'well', 'documented', 'happened', 'was', 'paramount', 'life', 'also', 'others', 'Beatles', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'part', 'other', 'interests', 'such', 'car', 'racing', 'movies', 'Life', 'Brian', 'episode', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'relationship', 'other', 'great', 'musicians', 'such', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'etc', 'was', 'nice', 'addition.In', 'opinion', 'documental', 'was', 'candid', 'very', 'well', 'presented', 'facts', 'did', 'not', 'try', 'portrait', 'saint', 'was', 'kind', 'hard', 'hear', 'own', 'wife', 'talking', 'weakness', 'ladies', 'something', 'others', 'have', 'reported', 'not', 'such', 'personal', 'way', 'Olivia', 'Harrison', 'did', 'think', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'part.I', 'enjoyed', 'documental', 'recommend', 'George', 'Beatles', 'fans', 'are', 'not', 'Beatle', 'fan', 'am', 'afraid', 'could', 'get', 'little', 'bit', 'bored', 'was', ""n't"", 'Still', 'nice', 'historical', 'perspective', 'music', 'have', 'today', 'definitively', 'had', 'rots', 'influences', 'music', 'time.George', 'Harrison', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'Beatle', 'others', 'wrote', 'sang', 'played', 'songs', 'peace/love', 'George', 'Actually', 'took', 'action', 'Bangladesh', 'concert', 'help', 'people', 'tormented', 'natural', 'disasters', 'give', 'relief', 'hope', 'regard', 'was', 'pioneer', 'well', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'artist', 'got', 'together', 'plethora', 'stars', 'good', 'cause', 'notice', 'Paul', 'was', 'not', 'there', 'read', 'somewhere', 'John', 'wanted', 'Yoko', 'was', 'stage', 'Harrison', 'refusal', 'Lennon', 'opted', 'out', '..None', 'was', 'also', 'included', 'part', 'Bangladesh', 'concert.The', 'fact', 'such', 'close', 'relationship', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'drove', 'back', 'times', 'great', 'impressionist', 'painters', 'know', 'other', 'such', 'Degas', 'Cezanne', 'Monet', 'Manet', 'Paul', 'Gauguin', 'friendship', 'Vincent', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'History', 'usually', 'geniuses', 'groups', '.Harrison', 'definitively', 'was', 'more', 'spiritual', 'four', 'fact', 'needed', 'cope', 'frustrations', 'sometimes', 'kind', 'erratic', 'behavior', 'great', 'swings', 'vicious', 'words', 'gentle', 'actions', 'level', 'rest', 'can', 'understand', 'relate', 'identify', 'course', 'love/admire', 'even', 'more']",George Harrison - Living in the Material World
1459120,AKYCVQN0EN2T8,B005FPT2E0,"Jeff Walker ""It-Was-Never-Over""","[4, 8]","I guess when Martin Scorsese is putting together a documentary, no one is shy about granting an interview. It was great to see the likes of wife Olivia, son Dhani, Mac, Clapton, Jackie Stewart, Eric Idle, Ray Cooper, that Krishna Consciousness devotee, Ravi, Ringo et al reminiscing. Olivia gives a pretty frank account of their relationship, which must have been pretty stormy for her to have cited an adage I hadn`t heard before: `What is the secret of a long marriage...Not getting divorced`. She wouldn`t say so explicitly, but it would seem that George had a major problem with sexual fidelity even during this, his second and more fulfilling marriage. And how good could it make her feel, at the very end of the film, when George says the only thing he will REALLY regret about leaving this life is not being a father longer to his son. No mention of the wife.I, doubtless, am not the only one who has a real problem with George`s denigration of the only life we know for the sake of glorifying existence on some astral plane that probably doesn`t even exist. Still it seems he was a wonderful friend to a great many people and went out of his way to make them feel good. It could be a matter of both one-upsmanship and sour grapes: In his own mind he kept one-up on his rock`n`roll friends by holding to Krishna Consciousness by way of a supposedly profound and exotic (to Westerners) system of belief, one that would trump the superficiality of the celebrity circuit, and at the same time, he could wield his celebrity status to maintain a safe distance from real immersion in Krishna Con and many of its more boring adherents by keeping one foot in the world of music and film. Too bad he didn`t truly immerse himself for enough time to quit smoking, since that`s mainly what took away a decade or two from his lifespan. There`s where the sour grapes come in. It`s easier to accept that you`re dying prematurely (due to mostly your own misguided actions) if you believe that you`re not going to be missing much anyways since life is just maya and a pale shadow of a life beyond. I think if George had grown up in India, he might have eventually wanted to try on Roman Catholicism for size, but be equally ambivalent about that as well.Would have liked to see more about his career as an executive film producer, presiding over a very impressive set of films. More on his 1991 tour of Japan. Would have been nice to get a Dylan interview but I guess there`s the Dylan ego problem. More on his development as an Indian-music-influenced slide guitar player. Something on how he helped wreck Ringo`s first marriage by having an affair with Mo (Of course, they both wound up with far happier second marriages, so...) Such suggestions are not to criticize Scorsese`s choices, but merely to suggest just how interesting and rich George`s post-Beatles life was. We appreciators of George as an equal of John or Paul as a songwriter and player as of 1969 would love to have seen more, but I guess a four-hour documentary might have been too much for most viewers.Hilarious George ad Mac anecdote by Mac in the bonus features, though it does sound familiar. The bonus features are worth a peek, but all were definitely best left out.Anyways, a deserving tribute to the man from a director of note with a genuine interest in Harrison`s life. Well-done.

Oleson,"[2, 2]","None other than Martin Scorsese pulls together tons of video clips, home movies, still photos, print clippings and interesting interviews to explore the life of the ""quiet"" Beatle.  The 2 disc Blu ray set runs nearly 3  hours (not including supplements) divided into 2 parts.  There is another 20 minutes or so of bonus features.Part I details Harrison's early days with the Beatles.  This section is as much about the Beatles and their emergence as it is about George.  We can see that John and Paul essentially run the group, write almost all the songs leaving George and Ringo only occasional input.  All the while George is collecting numerous songs he'd written but never made it on a record, at least until the last Beatle albums.  By then he had had enough.  For him the break-up was a good thing.Part 2 deals with Harrison's talents becoming mainstream with a cadre of great songs, many of which were attributed to The Beatles.  We see his first marriage fail when Pattie Boyd leaves for best friend Eric Clapton, although there isn't anything too juicy explained by any of the participants.  We see how Harrison became heavily influenced by Ravi Shankar and meditation.  Even the eventual love of his life, Olivia admits George continued to have affairs after their marriage, but Scorsese keeps a respectful distance.The best part of the film is the great interviews with those that loved Harrison.  In addition to the obvious choices, we hear from race car driver Jackie Stewart, record impresario Phil Spector, actress Jane Birkin, actor/comedian Eric Idle and director Terry Gilliam along with some of the great musicians Harrison played with.

Once this very impressive intro passes by, LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD dives into conventional bio storytelling that centers largely on George -- and that's where the problems begin. It's not George's fault that he's a bit dull. As he says himself somewhere toward the end of the film from what is probably a 1980s or 1990s interview, he's not a showbiz kind of guy. Far from it, he's a spiritualist living in a mansion who was, by all accounts of those who knew him, a good and kind friend and a great dad. Lovely man, for sure, a bit dire at times, but still a man who really did try to live a decent and meaningful life and strived to help others when he could. He also loved the ukulele. And long, meandering Indian tunes. And he loved planting trees. You see where I am going here?

Some of the editing is daft - Why set a montage of wartime England getting bombed to a lugubrious version of ""All Things Must Pass""-  And I'm not sure George's story (capable but not exactly astonishing guitarist for the Beatles, writer of a few great songs after ten years of watching John & Paul write them) is worthy of a four-hour documentary.

The most blatant are George's music and some people in his life.Re the missing music: there is nothing that George recorded between Dark Horse and The Traveling Wilburys. No 33 & 1/3, no All Those Years Ago, not even Cloud Nine (including the great videos of these records). Also: nothing from the pro-shot 1991 Japanese tour with Eric, from the Prince's Trust Concert, and neither from the Carl Perkins TV special.It's true the documentary is 3 and a half hours long, but had it to be a one-piece film? George wanted an Anthology, like the Beatles' one, so why didn't they make a series of 7 or 8 episodes? They had plenty of material.The other big absence is Patty's. In this respect, Olivia did quite a nasty job. Patty, the woman who shared the most significant part of George's life, the one who introduced him to the Indian spirituality, is reduced to some discussions about her infidelity with Eric. As for her presence in the film, there is a fragment of an old footage (quite insignificant) where she was a bit angry with the other three Beatles, and a paragraph from her (audio)book. Isn't that a shame...How ironic this must be for Patty: after being forced to deal with the fans' nastiness in the 60's (and she was constantly physically and verbally abused), with all the humiliations coming from George (mainly his many infidelities inclusively with Ringo's first wife), as well as with George's public statement that Something was not about her (he could be a perfect gentleman sometimes, George), now she is refused her own past and history.

Where the first disc documented his young life and his time with The Beatles, the second disc really was about the man that George had become.

1459159,AZ49LEQ9GGDQI,B005FPT2E0,Some Other Guy,"[2, 2]","Martin Scorcese's Living In The Material World, while more cohesive than his Bob Dylan doc, still has its peaks and valleys, and the fact that it holds together better might well be due to pervasive knowledge of the Beatles story rather than his presentation. That said, there are a lot of treats for the eyes via photos and video footage that has never been seen before.Its downfall of course is reliance on photos and footage that have been seen if not over-exposed.In some respects the use of footage from the Beatles Anthology seems redundant. Borrowing footage from someone else's documentary to make your own does not seem to be the way to go. In some instances, Scorcese redeems himself on that point by using alternate takes or material that didn't make it into the Anthology's final cut. But in a pinch he does fall upon segments lifted directly from Anthology. Meanwhile those bits culled from the Anthology's cutting room floor pose the tittilating question, how much more is there we haven't seen, an answer those of us who own a bootleg of an early cut of that doc already partially know. Doubtlessly, Scorcese would have offered more were it not for the fact that the scope of his film was George alone.Probably the most disappointing offering here is the footage from Let It Be. Not only is public starved for and denied the film's re-release, but in the modern world view of fans who enjoy outtakes as much as the finished product, the Let It Be archives surely offer a treasure trove. One would have hoped a man of the reputation of Martin Scorcese could have wrestled some of those unseen treats from tightly guarding fists of Apple. Disappointing, not only is that not the case but we get the one scene that emphasizes the aspect of that project remaining Beatles believe should not be made public, the ugly in-fighting between members of the band. It has been argued by Paul and Ringo, apparently, that Let It Be's release would denigrate the reputation and legacy of the band for future fans. Unfortunately, by denying fans access both to the original film and miles of outtakes that certainly exist, they only further emphasize that one little tif between Paul and George, as we see it repeatedly with no other material to give it context or balance it out.Also disappointing among what's missing from the Material World is more footage from obvious sources like the Rutles, a project that George championed and even did a cameo in. It gets mentioned only in passing.Overall, I'm nitpicking here. There is much here that is good. A lot of great interviews and a few moving moments and another great excuse to pour over details about the Fab Four. That it could have been better does not mean it ain't worth the price of the ticket.

Despite its 210-minute running time it never drags and holds the viewer's attention throughout.The format is a roughly chronological narrative which follows Scorsese's usual `fly-on-the-wall' style of no-voiceover-commentary, allowing for the interviewees - Paul McCartney, Ringo, Eric Clapton, Phil Spector, Jackie Stewart, Klaus Voorman, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Olivia and Dhani Harrison and George himself (not a complete list by any means) - to do the talking. The memories are poignant, honest, heartfelt and engaging, offering a mostly sympathetic portrait of this most introspective of Beatles juxtaposed with archive footage and stills from George's long career, plus some live concert and studio sessions.Some of the most arresting moments explore George's rejection of the trappings of fame, lack of interest in awards and quest for deeper self-knowledge and `spirituality'. Harrison's long friendship with Ravi Shankar and interest in Indian mysticism, his wicked sense of humour and his warm generosity, his love of privacy in his Surrey home which he carefully re-landscaped himself with spade in hand, all reveal a man who strove, sometimes in small ways and sometimes on a big canvas - like his 1971 visionary project to raise money for victims of the Bangladesh famine, a blueprint for Bob Geldof's `Live Aid' project 15 years later - to make the world a better place; to make a difference.George Harrison was in so many ways an exceptional and atypical rock star, and Martin Scorsese has done him proud with this superb film. If you are of a later generation who missed the 1960s and 1970s, and the name George Harrison means little to you, then seeing this film might be time well spent; it'll give you a flavour of this talented, generous and unusual man. And BTW if you love and appreciate the Pythons' `Life of Brian' - well, it would never have seen the light of day without George, whose financial support enabled the film to be made.",5,Scorsese delivers a fine bio-pic of the deeper Beatle,1335916800,"05 2, 2012",2012,2469,"['Following', 'outstanding', '2005', 'documentary', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'early', 'career', 'Direction', 'Home', 'excellent', 'series', 'blues', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'again', 'be', 'master', 'craft', 'in-depth', 'bio-pic', 'documentary', 'film-making', 'glorious', 'colourful', 'warts-and-all', 'portrait', 'George', 'Harrison.The', 'film', 'available', 'either', 'two', 'separate', 'DVDs', 'Beatles', 'break-up', 'divider', 'one', 'single', 'uninterrupted', 'DVD', 'can', 'take', 'three-and-a-half', 'hour', 'film', 'one', 'sitting', '210-minute', 'running', 'time', 'never', 'viewer', 'attention', 'throughout.The', 'format', 'roughly', 'chronological', 'narrative', 'Scorsese', 'usual', 'fly-on-the-wall', 'style', 'no-voiceover-commentary', 'allowing', 'interviewees', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Ringo', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Phil', 'Spector', 'Jackie', 'Stewart', 'Klaus', 'Voorman', 'Eric', 'Idle', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'Olivia', 'Dhani', 'Harrison', 'George', 'not', 'complete', 'list', 'means', 'do', 'talking', 'memories', 'are', 'poignant', 'honest', 'heartfelt', 'engaging', 'offering', 'mostly', 'sympathetic', 'portrait', 'most', 'introspective', 'Beatles', 'juxtaposed', 'archive', 'footage', 'stills', 'George', 'long', 'career', 'live', 'concert', 'studio', 'sessions.Some', 'most', 'arresting', 'moments', 'explore', 'George', 'rejection', 'trappings', 'fame', 'lack', 'interest', 'awards', 'quest', 'deeper', 'self-knowledge', 'spirituality', 'Harrison', 'long', 'friendship', 'Ravi', 'Shankar', 'interest', 'Indian', 'mysticism', 'wicked', 'sense', 'humour', 'warm', 'generosity', 'love', 'privacy', 'Surrey', 'home', 'carefully', 're-landscaped', 'spade', 'hand', 'reveal', 'man', 'who', 'strove', 'sometimes', 'small', 'ways', 'sometimes', 'big', 'canvas', '1971', 'visionary', 'project', 'raise', 'money', 'victims', 'Bangladesh', 'famine', 'blueprint', 'Bob', 'Geldof', 'Live', 'Aid', 'project', '15', 'years', 'later', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'make', 'difference.George', 'Harrison', 'was', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'exceptional', 'atypical', 'rock', 'star', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'done', 'proud', 'superb', 'film', 'are', 'later', 'generation', 'who', 'missed', '1960s', '1970s', 'name', 'George', 'Harrison', 'little', 'then', 'seeing', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'time', 'well', 'spent', ""'ll"", 'give', 'flavour', 'talented', 'generous', 'unusual', 'man', 'BTW', 'love', 'appreciate', 'Pythons', 'Life', 'Brian', 'well', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'George', 'financial', 'support', 'enabled', 'film', 'be', 'made']",George Harrison - Living in the Material World

I was quickly disappointed when I realized it was simply a bunch of interviews and old film clips.  There was no narration to carry the film so it was essentially a grab bag of items.  The first hour was a waste as it didn't reveal anything new about the Beatle era.  His life after the Beatles was what I really wanted to see and although there were a few bits and pieces that were worth seeing (the interviews with Tom Petty and Patti Harrison were by far the best) it was really not worth the cost of admission.,3,Too long and too much repetition,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,637,"['George', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'Beatle', 'reminded', 'father', 'so', 'was', 'excited', 'watch', 'documentary', 'was', 'quickly', 'disappointed', 'when', 'realized', 'was', 'simply', 'bunch', 'interviews', 'old', 'film', 'clips', 'was', 'narration', 'carry', 'film', 'was', 'essentially', 'grab', 'bag', 'items', 'first', 'hour', 'was', 'waste', 'did', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'anything', 'new', 'Beatle', 'era', 'life', 'Beatles', 'was', 'what', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'were', 'few', 'bits', 'pieces', 'were', 'worth', 'seeing', 'interviews', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Patti', 'Harrison', 'were', 'far', 'best', 'was', 'really', 'not', 'cost', 'admission']",George Harrison - Living in the Material World
