This time, five friends -three girls and two guys- are on vacation together. While driving along, the group is followed by someone in a dark van. The van seems to appear wherever they go. Is it all coincidence, or are they being stalked?  Of course, one of them -named Leo- films almost everything that happens. They arrive at their destination -a big empty house- and settle in for the night. A party ensues, everyone gets drunk, and night gives way to day. Oh, those crazy, fun-loving kids! They start off on a snowy hike through the deep woods to see some &#34;Indian drawings&#34;. Naturally, they get lost, tempers flare, and day becomes night. Then, otherworldly noises begin echoing through the trees. If only they'd stayed in the nice, warm house! Wait a minute! There's the house up ahead! Yay! Time for more beer! During a late dinner, the hang-up calls start. Next, the knocking at the door, and a mysterious package is left on the porch. It contains a video tape. They watch it and are shocked to see...  themselves! Yep, the creepy van guy is a videographer as well as a stalker! The tension mounts as the video becomes increasingly intimate.

1436324,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00519BOY6,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 3]","Evil Things is a wonderfully creepy little thriller that has everything most films of this genre lack &#8211; a compelling storyline, really effective acting, and filmmakers that actually appreciate true suspense and know how to manifest it on film.  I love blood and gore even more than the next guy, but the reality is that blood and gore are often used to prop up movies lacking a decent plot.  The truly remarkable horror film does not require blood to be shed on camera and usually succeeds much better without it.  Evil Things is a case in point.  I&#8217;ve watched and reviewed hundreds and hundreds of horror films, and I&#8217;m telling you that I want to shout from the rooftops about just how good this movie is.  I really can&#8217;t understand why so many people hate it so much.This film works because it is wholly believable &#8211; and disquietingly so.  Let&#8217;s face it: the odds are quite low that your camping trip will turn in to a fight for survival against a family of inbred cannibals or three days and nights of terror against an evil spirit of legend, that those quasi-friends of yours who unexpectedly invited you for a weekend on the lake are really planning on sacrificing you to some demi-god, or that some dude is going to stumble up to your cabin with some form of hellishly contagious, organ-liquefying disease.  Films with those kinds of plots can certainly scare you &#8211; but only up to a point.  Evil Things, in contrast, tells a story that you can envision really happening &#8211; and, just to boost things up a notch, it all goes down in a place you would normally feel safe and secure.  I&#8217;m not talking about coming home to find some dangerous psycho waiting for you or waking up to find an intruder &#8211; that&#8217;s much too quick and easy.  This story builds up the tension slowly, as the characters cycle through increasingly worrisome moments of fear and relief, letting much of the horror percolate in the audience&#8217;s imagination before finally unleashing its full fury.  It&#8217;s not at all difficult to put yourself in the place of these unfortunate characters, and that is a recipe for an avalanche of creepiness.To say this film has no plot is simply laughable.  Let&#8217;s see: five friends head out of New York City to enjoy a wintry weekend out in the country, at the home of one girl&#8217;s aunt, celebrating the 21st birthday of one of their own.  Their trip along increasingly snow-packed roads is made even more eventful by a case of road rage that eventually escalates into so much more.  I was quite impressed by the acting.  The characters are quite funny when they&#8217;re relaxed and goofing around, and they seem genuinely frightened by the increasingly ominous circumstance they find themselves in.  These girls can scream with the best of them, to boot.  With a budget of just over three million dollars, Evil Things proves that you don&#8217;t need a lot of money in order to generate visceral fear and dread.  To me, effective horror is all about the creepiness factor, and this is one of the creepiest films I&#8217;ve seen in years.  I don&#8217;t care what anybody else says &#8211; I freakin&#8217; love this movie.",5,Genuinely and exceedingly creepy,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,3212,"['Evil', 'Things', 'wonderfully', 'creepy', 'little', 'thriller', 'everything', 'most', 'films', 'genre', 'lack', '8211', 'compelling', 'storyline', 'really', 'effective', 'acting', 'filmmakers', 'actually', 'appreciate', 'true', 'suspense', 'know', 'how', 'manifest', 'film', 'love', 'blood', 'gore', 'even', 'more', 'next', 'guy', 'reality', 'blood', 'gore', 'are', 'often', 'used', 'prop', 'up', 'movies', 'lacking', 'decent', 'plot', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'require', 'blood', 'be', 'shed', 'camera', 'usually', 'much', 'better', 'Evil', 'Things', 'case', 'point', '8217', 'watched', 'reviewed', 'hundreds', 'hundreds', 'horror', 'films', '8217', 'telling', 'want', 'shout', 'rooftops', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'really', 'can', '8217', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'hate', 'so', 'much.This', 'film', 'works', 'wholly', 'believable', '8211', 'disquietingly', 'so', 'Let', '8217', 'face', 'odds', 'are', 'quite', 'low', 'camping', 'trip', 'will', 'turn', 'fight', 'survival', 'family', 'inbred', 'cannibals', 'three', 'days', 'nights', 'terror', 'evil', 'spirit', 'legend', 'quasi-friends', 'yours', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'invited', 'weekend', 'lake', 'are', 'really', 'planning', 'sacrificing', 'demi-god', 'dude', 'going', 'stumble', 'up', 'cabin', 'form', 'hellishly', 'contagious', 'organ-liquefying', 'disease', 'Films', 'kinds', 'plots', 'can', 'certainly', 'scare', '8211', 'only', 'up', 'point', 'Evil', 'Things', 'contrast', 'story', 'can', 'envision', 'really', 'happening', '8211', 'just', 'boost', 'things', 'up', 'notch', 'down', 'place', 'would', 'normally', 'feel', 'safe', 'secure', '8217', 'not', 'talking', 'coming', 'home', 'find', 'dangerous', 'psycho', 'waiting', 'waking', 'up', 'find', 'intruder', '8211', '8217', 's', 'much', 'too', 'quick', 'easy', 'story', 'up', 'tension', 'slowly', 'characters', 'cycle', 'increasingly', 'worrisome', 'moments', 'fear', 'relief', 'letting', 'much', 'horror', 'percolate', 'audience', '8217', 'imagination', 'finally', 'unleashing', 'full', 'fury', '8217', 'not', 'difficult', 'put', 'place', 'unfortunate', 'characters', 'recipe', 'avalanche', 'creepiness.To', 'say', 'film', 'plot', 'simply', 'laughable', 'Let', '8217', 'see', 'five', 'friends', 'head', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'enjoy', 'wintry', 'weekend', 'country', 'home', 'one', 'girl', '8217', 's', 'aunt', 'celebrating', '21st', 'birthday', 'one', 'own', 'trip', 'increasingly', 'snow-packed', 'roads', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'eventful', 'case', 'road', 'rage', 'eventually', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'acting', 'characters', 'are', 'quite', 'funny', 'when', '8217', 're', 'relaxed', 'goofing', 'around', 'seem', 'genuinely', 'frightened', 'increasingly', 'ominous', 'circumstance', 'find', 'girls', 'can', 'scream', 'best', 'boot', 'budget', 'just', 'three', 'million', 'dollars', 'Evil', 'Things', 'don', '8217', 'need', 'lot', 'money', 'order', 'generate', 'visceral', 'fear', 'dread', 'effective', 'horror', 'creepiness', 'factor', 'one', 'creepiest', 'films', '8217', 've', 'seen', 'years', 'don', '8217', 'care', 'what', 'anybody', 'else', '8211', 'freakin', '8217', 'love', 'movie']",Evil Things

1436330,A3T29QVYZ7IBAL,B00519BOY6,"Jennifer Chatham ""Mad Moose Mama""","[2, 4]","Evil Things from Inception Media Group starts out with five college friends getting ready for a trip to the mountains for Miriam's (Elyssa Mersdorf) 21st birthday. Miriam's Aunt Gayle (Gail Cadden) has provided the group with a cabin and after a slight misunderstanding, the group settles in for their wonderful weekend out of the city.However, before the weekend ends, the five friends are in fear for their lives as someone unknown to them has followed them from the city and is playing a psychological game with their heads.The first night they get drunk and have a great birthday celebration. The next day the five go on a hike to look for ancient Native cave drawings and they become lost in the woods. After hours and hours of searching, night has fallen, the group is getting scared and nervous, they are finally steered in the correct direction by the ""animals"" that they are hearing. Thankful to have ""found"" their way back to the cabin, they head inside to get warmth and food.Later on in the night, the phone rings but no one is on the other end and there is a knock at the door. When they answer it, they find a package. The contents of the package freak the group out and they try to flee their surroundings and get back to civilization. However, it may be too late as each of the group go missing and there are no clues as to what or who is tormenting them.The movie is shot Blair Witch Project style from the camera lens of Leo (Morgan Hooper), Miriam's boyfriend. It contains all the jostling and bouncing and out-of-focus shots you would normally encounter with a home movie. The audio is sometimes muffled, often you can hear them breathing or rustling as they move throughout the picture, giving it an authentic home -movie feel.I thought that the backstory of the characters portrayed was long, tiresome and without any real direction. I would have liked to have seen more creep involved in this aspect of the movie. I think the movie could have done without a majority of the beginning narrative; I found my attention drifting while the first thirty minutes of the movie played out. As well, the opening scenes did not give me any real like for the characters in that I didn't learn anything about them that gave me a genuine interest in their adventure.Laurel Castillo does bring a strong performance to the character of Cassy Crawford. She delivers it with as much finesse as she is able given the weak plot and poor direction. She is able to deliver a multi-character performance reaching into her depth and drawing out the fear and horror needed to give Evil Things a diversity to the characters involved, that would otherwise be lacking.The interpretation of the antagonist in the story is definitely a creepy concept and it is outlined in a fashion that does bring the creep into you. In this, director, Dominic Perez, delivers the edge needed to make this picture worth watching.However, we are given so little in the final outcome of the picture that you are left with more questions than answers. The added footage strewn throughout the end credits does not give any added significance to the overall movie, and I wasn't left with the impression that I needed to have seen it in order to fully understand the movie.Evil Things is a horror/psychological thriller and is rated R. Its running time is 86 minutes and comes in DVD and widescreen format only.

On the way, a van begins to play games with them--honking its horn, cutting in front of them and forcing them to drive slow. We sense this is going to be a crucial fear factor later on.But for the next 50 minutes, we watch the photographed antics of the group as they have a birthday party, they sit around and get drunk. The next day they get lost in the snowy woods. Since it's not snowing, one wonders why they couldn't just follow their own footsteps back into the house.All this time we're waiting for SOMETHING to happen and it finally does--heralded by phone calls, a pounding on the front door, a package left on the steps, a videotape made by someone whose gotten into the house at night and filmed them asleep.when the creeper finally comes into the house, the girls all shriek and run upstairs and wait for the boys to protect them. I was surprised that these healthy, strong girls behaved so idiotically. Not only did they do nothing to protect themselves, they never even armed themselves with a butcher knife, a heavy vase, nothing.  They were like throwbacks to women characters in films of the past. They stood by weakly, offering no aide to their male protectors.The movie ends on a disturbing note. We have no idea what happened to the group. While the credits roll, we see curious scenes of a stalker in NYC, and another scene perhaps of the killer, while he watches several TV screens, including the footage he shot in the death house.I'm looking forward to more movies from this director.",3,Who Lurks Outside Our House?,1365638400,"04 11, 2013",2013,1978,"['When', 'quickly', 'realized', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'lost', 'footage', 'efforts', 'would', 'be', 'shot', 'one', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'started', 'hit', 'eject', 'button.I', ""'m"", 'glad', ""didn't.Director"", 'Dominic', 'Perez', 'template', 'revitalizes', 'making', 'EVIL', 'THINGS', 'moderately', 'scare', 'delight.We', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'car', 'full', 'All-American', 'college', 'kids', 'two', 'boys', 'three', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'traveling', 'friend', 'manor', 'snowy', 'woods', 'way', 'van', 'play', 'games', 'honking', 'horn', 'cutting', 'front', 'forcing', 'drive', 'slow', 'sense', 'going', 'be', 'crucial', 'fear', 'factor', 'later', 'on.But', 'next', '50', 'minutes', 'watch', 'photographed', 'antics', 'group', 'have', 'birthday', 'party', 'sit', 'around', 'get', 'drunk', 'next', 'day', 'get', 'lost', 'snowy', 'woods', 'not', 'snowing', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'follow', 'own', 'footsteps', 'back', 'house.All', 'time', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'SOMETHING', 'happen', 'finally', 'heralded', 'phone', 'calls', 'pounding', 'front', 'door', 'package', 'left', 'steps', 'videotape', 'made', 'someone', 'gotten', 'house', 'night', 'filmed', 'asleep.when', 'creeper', 'finally', 'house', 'girls', 'shriek', 'run', 'upstairs', 'wait', 'boys', 'protect', 'was', 'surprised', 'healthy', 'strong', 'girls', 'behaved', 'so', 'idiotically', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'do', 'nothing', 'protect', 'never', 'even', 'armed', 'butcher', 'knife', 'heavy', 'vase', 'nothing', 'were', 'like', 'throwbacks', 'women', 'characters', 'films', 'past', 'stood', 'weakly', 'offering', 'aide', 'male', 'protectors.The', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'note', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'happened', 'group', 'credits', 'roll', 'see', 'curious', 'scenes', 'stalker', 'NYC', 'scene', 'perhaps', 'killer', 'several', 'TV', 'screens', 'including', 'footage', 'death', 'house.I', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'more', 'movies', 'director']",Evil Things

Straight from the opening cut as the kids are leaving home and getting in the car, we realize this film is mirroring Blair Witch in a distorted way. This film blatantly rewrites some of Blair Witch's scenes even down to talking about food, doing interviews, etc. They even get lost in the woods, which, in my book was stupid. They carry on about being lost, oh what do we do, we are lost, we will die here. Well, since it did snow heavily the night before, and it's not snowing now, maybe follow your own tracks back. bet you never thought of that, little Einsteins!The characters are very uninteresting. Only at one point, the lead female puts on a man's wig, and acts like another character's mother, does the film get entertaining.The film took almost 50 minutes of bad acting before anything really interesting happens. And that is when a video tape shows up on the front porch. They watch the tape and realize they themselves have been watched. That concept was chilling. But that was it for spooky parts.

Five college friends decide to celebrate a friends 21st birthday at her aunt and uncle's house in the country. On the way there they are tormented by a man in a van, they finally reach thier destination think they are in for a relaxing weekend.  In the last ten years there have basically been two types of horror movies.  The ""Saw"" type, and the ""Reality"" (Paranormal Activity & Blair Witch like) type.  This falls into the reality style, but it is actually pretty good.  When I watched ""The Blair With Project"" the first time I thought it was a pretty neat idea, but very, very boring with a stupid ending.  To me this is the type of movie that ""Blair Witch"" wanted to be.  The movie seems very much the same, no script, just a basic idea of what they wanted and everything creepy happens off camera so you just get a sense of what is going on, which adds to the effect.  I am not saying this is a hide under the bed scary, but it does have it's creepy moments.  Most of the horror is in the waiting for something to happen, much like in ""Paranormal Activity 2"".  One bad thing I will say about the movie is that it should have ended 20 min before it did.  I guess the director wanted people to stay through the credits so it added more clips, but that's what DVD special features are for.  Overall, very surprisingly good inde-horror that is much better then ""Blair Witch"".
