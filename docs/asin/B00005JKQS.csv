It has a few other flaws as well. But there are a lot of reasons to like a movie and sometimes you have to make allowences.What works about it? Matthew O'Leary and Vince Vaughn; the helpless kid &amp; the bad guy. As the movie progresses, the kid gets more and more loveable and the evil dude becomes ever more despicable. Everything you need for this type of movie to be successful; a couple of very good actors in the right roles, convincingly earning, in this case, our sympathy or our bile. Even if the movie holds up in no other way for you, these two actors are sure to do their part. Settings, production, background, or script aside, these two deliver.Predictable? Somewhat, sure. How many movies aren't? As for Trovolta perhaps being a little off, hey, the man is very busy. Besides, he was supposed to be low-key in this role, the emphasis of the movie being his son's plight. I think ultimately he served that role very well.So despite its flaws, this movie still works, and I think quite well.

590325,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JKQS,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 5]","Domestic Disturbance is a typical Hollywood film.  The story, characters, and even the camerawork all seem prefabricated and recycled.  The language that Travolta and Vaughn spurt from their mouths even feels repetitive.  Do you know why?  Because we have seen it all before.  This film did not scare me, did not entice me, or even excite me in anyway because of the resemblance this had to every other film of this genre.  It is the classic story of the boy that cried wolf too many times and eventually everyone never believed him.  It is the classic story of the strength of a father that believes that when life throws lemons, that he must make lemonade.  It is the classic story of the family struggle to survive against all odds.  It is nothing fresh, it is nothing new, it is nothing remarkable.  It is Hollywood, in its purest form.  Audiences paid money to see this recycled film and for that I think we should all be issued an apology from the Hollywood community.I even have the subtle feeling that everyone involved in this project felt the same way.  Travolta and Vaughn are laughable in their roles.  The child actor was acting, and you could tell every time he was on screen.  The only ""fun"" character in this entire production was Steve Buscemi, who continually plays this slippery sneaky fishy looking character that just gets under your skin the wrong way.  He was perfect, I only wish I could say the same for everyone else.  Perhaps it is my newer images of Vaughn that hurt him in this role.  After seeing the comedy duds like Dodgeball and Starsky & Hutch, I couldn't help but think that Vaughn was trying to play a bit of comedy into this role as well.  He just didn't seem to fit.  His eyes needed to see evil, when in fact they saw nothing more than the cue cards reminding him of his lines.  I kept waiting to hear him say something to Travolta about ""Vegas Baby, Vegas"", but alas, it never occurred.  I felt similar about Travolta's role in this film.  His character suffered from lack of solidity.  I never felt that he was a strong father.  I knew he could build boats, but fight evil I just couldn't see it.  I also had trouble seeing the father/son dynamic.  During the scenes that him and O'Leary share, I continually felt that they were acting their parts, not building the characters.  It was sad, and only left me with a weak impression of them when the climax occurred.  Teri Polo was shallow, really contributing nothing to the story other than the classic role of mother who will not believe, while child actor Matt O'Leary definatly needed more time with an acting coach before landing this role.  All of these paid actors were going through their parts, but not into their characters, which ultimately flawed the film.What happens when you have actors not reaching their potential and a story that seems like it could be a ""Made-for-TV-Movie""?  You get the film Domestic Disturbance.  The story was horrible.  Father who loves his son, who cannot let go of a previous life (although it seemed that in the film Travolta and Polo were ok with there divorce), who doesn't trust his ex-wife's new beau.  This seemed like a very troubled man instead of the hero that he portrayed.  I also felt that this story really didn't give any credit to the local police.  Instead of investigating, it seemed like they were just sitting around.  That was Travolta's tax dollars at work, but instead he ended up doing all the work.  It reminded me of the times that I have to bag my own groceries at the story.  Am I not paying for the goods so that they can provide baggers?  Ah well.  From the opening scene of this film until the unclimactic ending (which made me chuckle due to the lack of sympathy), it was nothing more than Hollywood fluff.  Travolta had been making a strong return to the film industry prior to this project, and I wish that somebody had talked him out of it.  This film was filler, and plenty of people got paid for some shoddy workmanship.Overall, I was very disappointed with this film.  In fact, I was more than disappointed, I was appalled.  This had no redeeming value to it (outside of Buscemi) and it continually perplexed me as to why it was made.  There was no stretching of anyone's acting ability, nor did I ever really see the power family structure that was so important to the characters.  What I saw was an angry father upset about the path his life has taken, and decides to do something about it using his son's lies as a crutch.  Perhaps I needed Vaughn's character to be darker, or maybe more boats built to help me understand Travolta's role, but something needed to happen and it didn't.  This was a sad excuse of a film, and I do not recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the cinema.Grade: ** out of *****",2,He doesn't lie to me.,1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,4776,"['Domestic', 'Disturbance', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'story', 'characters', 'even', 'camerawork', 'seem', 'prefabricated', 'recycled', 'language', 'Travolta', 'Vaughn', 'spurt', 'mouths', 'even', 'feels', 'repetitive', 'Do', 'know', 'why', 'have', 'seen', 'before', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'scare', 'did', 'not', 'entice', 'even', 'excite', 'anyway', 'resemblance', 'had', 'other', 'film', 'genre', 'classic', 'story', 'boy', 'cried', 'wolf', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'eventually', 'everyone', 'never', 'believed', 'classic', 'story', 'strength', 'father', 'when', 'life', 'lemons', 'must', 'make', 'lemonade', 'classic', 'story', 'family', 'struggle', 'survive', 'odds', 'nothing', 'fresh', 'nothing', 'new', 'nothing', 'remarkable', 'Hollywood', 'purest', 'form', 'Audiences', 'paid', 'money', 'see', 'recycled', 'film', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'issued', 'apology', 'Hollywood', 'community.I', 'even', 'have', 'subtle', 'feeling', 'everyone', 'involved', 'project', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'Travolta', 'Vaughn', 'are', 'laughable', 'roles', 'child', 'actor', 'was', 'acting', 'could', 'tell', 'time', 'was', 'screen', 'only', 'fun', 'character', 'entire', 'production', 'was', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'who', 'continually', 'slippery', 'sneaky', 'fishy', 'looking', 'character', 'just', 'skin', 'wrong', 'way', 'was', 'perfect', 'only', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'same', 'everyone', 'else', 'Perhaps', 'newer', 'images', 'Vaughn', 'hurt', 'role', 'seeing', 'comedy', 'duds', 'Dodgeball', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'Vaughn', 'was', 'trying', 'play', 'bit', 'comedy', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'eyes', 'needed', 'see', 'evil', 'when', 'fact', 'saw', 'nothing', 'more', 'cue', 'cards', 'reminding', 'lines', 'kept', 'waiting', 'hear', 'say', 'something', 'Travolta', 'Vegas', 'Baby', 'Vegas', 'alas', 'never', 'occurred', 'felt', 'similar', 'Travolta', 'role', 'film', 'character', 'suffered', 'lack', 'solidity', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'strong', 'father', 'knew', 'could', 'build', 'boats', 'fight', 'evil', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'also', 'had', 'trouble', 'seeing', 'father/son', 'dynamic', 'scenes', ""O'Leary"", 'share', 'continually', 'felt', 'were', 'acting', 'parts', 'not', 'building', 'characters', 'was', 'sad', 'only', 'left', 'weak', 'impression', 'when', 'climax', 'occurred', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'was', 'shallow', 'really', 'contributing', 'nothing', 'story', 'other', 'classic', 'role', 'mother', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'believe', 'child', 'actor', 'Matt', ""O'Leary"", 'definatly', 'needed', 'more', 'time', 'acting', 'coach', 'landing', 'role', 'paid', 'actors', 'were', 'going', 'parts', 'not', 'characters', 'ultimately', 'flawed', 'film.What', 'when', 'have', 'actors', 'not', 'reaching', 'potential', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'Made-for-TV-Movie', 'get', 'film', 'Domestic', 'Disturbance', 'story', 'was', 'horrible', 'Father', 'who', 'son', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'previous', 'life', 'seemed', 'film', 'Travolta', 'Polo', 'were', 'ok', 'divorce', 'who', ""n't"", 'trust', 'ex-wife', 'new', 'beau', 'seemed', 'very', 'troubled', 'man', 'instead', 'hero', 'portrayed', 'also', 'felt', 'story', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'credit', 'local', 'police', 'Instead', 'investigating', 'seemed', 'were', 'just', 'sitting', 'around', 'was', 'Travolta', 'tax', 'dollars', 'work', 'instead', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'work', 'reminded', 'times', 'have', 'bag', 'own', 'groceries', 'story', 'Am', 'not', 'paying', 'goods', 'so', 'can', 'provide', 'baggers', 'Ah', 'well', 'opening', 'scene', 'film', 'unclimactic', 'ending', 'made', 'chuckle', 'due', 'lack', 'sympathy', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'fluff', 'Travolta', 'had', 'been', 'making', 'strong', 'return', 'film', 'industry', 'prior', 'project', 'wish', 'somebody', 'had', 'talked', 'film', 'was', 'filler', 'plenty', 'people', 'got', 'paid', 'shoddy', 'workmanship.Overall', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'film', 'fact', 'was', 'more', 'disappointed', 'was', 'appalled', 'had', 'redeeming', 'value', 'Buscemi', 'continually', 'perplexed', 'why', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'stretching', 'anyone', 'acting', 'ability', 'did', 'ever', 'really', 'see', 'power', 'family', 'structure', 'was', 'so', 'important', 'characters', 'What', 'saw', 'was', 'angry', 'father', 'upset', 'path', 'life', 'taken', 'decides', 'do', 'something', 'using', 'son', 'lies', 'crutch', 'Perhaps', 'needed', 'Vaughn', 'character', 'be', 'darker', 'maybe', 'more', 'boats', 'built', 'help', 'understand', 'Travolta', 'role', 'something', 'needed', 'happen', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'sad', 'excuse', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'cinema.Grade', '**', '*****']",N/A

When this came out I didn't really know what I liked and for some reason I thought I liked this.  Ha, and so I bought it.  Having watched this recently I've come to realize just how awful it really is.  I mean, technically this movie is just stupid.The acting, as campy as it can be, is the films only real noteworthy point.The film tells the story of a divorced father's love for his son.  Yeah, my face is not straight.  Really, Frank is a jealous ex-husband who resents his ex-wife for marrying the seemingly straight laced Rick.  Their son, Danny, hates his new step-dad.  The problem is that Danny has a habit of lying and getting into trouble, so when he witnesses his new step-daddy killing someone no one believes him.Well, Frank does, but that's more because he REALLY wants to.The film is kind of comical in its approach.  I totally get some of the themes here, but this campy, corny delivery makes fun of it so-to-speak and makes it kind of laughable.  The situations that arise are preposterous, and the faux sense of tension that embodies this film is NOT authentic or lasting.  In fact, the final confrontation between Frank and Rick is one of the funniest (unintentional of course) scenes in movie history (well, that may be farfetched).  When John Travolta just burst into the garage to save the day, I was in stitches.Like I said, thankfully the actors here do a great job with what little they are handed.  John Travolta is effectively parental.  Even if the film kind of takes jabs at his personal state, he sells it.  Vince Vaughn steals this though.  He is just down right creepy.  I like Vince, always have, and while he is a far better comedian than a dramatic actor, he pulls this off very well.  Even when his character is slipping into camp, he remains at all times interesting.What ever happened to Teri Polo?Anyways, this film is pretty stupid, awfully so, but whatever.  If you have nothing better to do and want to soak in a preposterously entertaining thriller then, by all means, sit back and enjoy.  I don't see a need to ever watch this again, but I don't hate myself for having seen it once (well, twice).",2,Not quite disturbing enough...,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,2212,"['film', 'pretty', 'bad', 'funny', 'how', 'taste', 'changes', 'time', 'When', 'came', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'liked', 'reason', 'thought', 'liked', 'Ha', 'so', 'bought', 'Having', 'watched', 'recently', ""'ve"", 'come', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'awful', 'really', 'mean', 'technically', 'movie', 'just', 'stupid.The', 'acting', 'as', 'campy', 'can', 'be', 'films', 'only', 'real', 'noteworthy', 'point.The', 'film', 'story', 'divorced', 'father', 'love', 'son', 'Yeah', 'face', 'not', 'straight', 'Really', 'Frank', 'jealous', 'ex-husband', 'who', 'ex-wife', 'marrying', 'seemingly', 'straight', 'laced', 'Rick', 'son', 'Danny', 'new', 'step-dad', 'problem', 'Danny', 'habit', 'lying', 'getting', 'trouble', 'so', 'when', 'new', 'step-daddy', 'killing', 'someone', 'one', 'him.Well', 'Frank', 'more', 'REALLY', 'to.The', 'film', 'kind', 'comical', 'approach', 'totally', 'get', 'themes', 'here', 'campy', 'corny', 'delivery', 'fun', 'so-to-speak', 'kind', 'laughable', 'situations', 'arise', 'are', 'preposterous', 'faux', 'sense', 'tension', 'film', 'NOT', 'authentic', 'lasting', 'fact', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Frank', 'Rick', 'one', 'funniest', 'unintentional', 'course', 'scenes', 'movie', 'history', 'well', 'may', 'be', 'farfetched', 'When', 'John', 'Travolta', 'just', 'burst', 'garage', 'save', 'day', 'was', 'stitches.Like', 'said', 'thankfully', 'actors', 'here', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'what', 'little', 'are', 'handed', 'John', 'Travolta', 'effectively', 'parental', 'Even', 'film', 'kind', 'jabs', 'personal', 'state', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'though', 'just', 'down', 'right', 'creepy', 'like', 'Vince', 'always', 'have', 'far', 'better', 'comedian', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'Even', 'when', 'character', 'slipping', 'camp', 'times', 'interesting.What', 'ever', 'happened', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'Anyways', 'film', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'awfully', 'so', 'whatever', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'want', 'soak', 'preposterously', 'entertaining', 'thriller', 'then', 'means', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'need', 'ever', 'watch', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'having', 'seen', 'once', 'well', 'twice']",N/A

590330,ALR35EFI69S5R,B00005JKQS,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[4, 6]","This is only a passable action thriller that works along the genre and succeeds more on the basis of star power than on any kind of logical or believable plot. John Travolta has so much screen charisma he can make even this somewhat disjointed script work as he threads his way through the mixed motives and misleading signals coming from his ex-wife, his pre-adolescent son, and his son&#65533;s new step father, who the son claims he saw commit murder. Add into this mix the economic struggle and romantic troubles Travolta has diverting him (since he is a boat builder with more heart than business sense and a girl friend who has a lot of insecurity issues to deal with), and away we go into a muddled and mediocre plot line that only a star like Travolta can rescue us from.And rescue us he does, if only belatedly, for no one turns forceful and violent with more verve and purpose than a switched on Travolta, and he has moments of true movie magic and he starts to deliver on being the kind of worst nightmare he has promised the step father he could become if provoked. Of course, it takes a world class jerk to not recognize the trouble to come, and Vince Vaughn steps up to deliver the kind of raw, believable performance that makes the viewer yearn for the eventual come-uppance. Steve Buscemi is also appropriately devilish in his role as the ex-con friend of the step father. There are some twists and turns to the plot that are not especially convincing, but here the story is hardly the thing to watch. Instead, focus on Travolta and his portrayal of an otherwise gentle and compassionate man suddenly, finally giving in to his pent-up anger and growing rage.Older viewers may be reminded of what I would call the &#65533;Billy Jack&#65533; syndrome, that is, a portrayal of a man all too capable and comfortable with violence who is desperately trying to keep himself on a short leash both for his own sanity&#65533;s sake and for the benefit of others, until that fateful moment that someone triggers his anger and cuts the leash, and his will to resist just snaps. As with Billy Jack it happens again and again, but here it happens only meaningfully later in the film, when Travolta's character finally snaps. When it does finally happen the screen goes electric, and the last twenty minutes or so are great to experience.

There are some very bad reviews of this film here but it is not as bad as others may make it sound.  It is a B movie meant to be treated as such.  It is marketed as an intense thriller and it does have some creepy moments and some that will make you jump but overall it comes across more as a typical 90 minute made for tv film.  The fact that it stars major actors John Travolta and Vince Vaughan does raise the bar a little but it is still just your standard suspense film.Travolta plays a divorced father trying to deal with his wife's new marriage while keeping his strong relationship with his son intact.  He does manage to bring some depth and insight into a character from a script with little of that to offer.  Vaughan is the new husband and from the get go we know he is creepy.  He provides the appropriate stern voice and cold stares demanded.  When the son sees Vaughan commit a murder no one believes him except father Travolta.

And, to his credit, he does a wonderful job portraying the divorced father who is faced with the impossible: either believe an incredulous story from his frequently prevacating son, or trust the &quot;authorities&quot; and their assertion that nothing his son has claimed occurred.Fortunately for the audience, Travolta decides to go with his son on this one.  However, the movie tends down a standard path in the process of uncovering the truth about his son's new stepfather.  There are also some considerable leaps in deductive logic, and a few too many perfectly arranged situations that lead to a rather predictable conclusion.  One of the most annoying aspects of the film is how inept the local police department appears to be in gathering evidence.  I realize the events in the film take place in a small coastal town on the Eastern Seaboard, but they can't be so backward that they don't even have a connection to the internet.Casting for this feature is outstanding.  Matthew O'Leary, as Travolta's son, is fantastic in his ability to play the classic child of a divorced family.  Vince Vaughn is able to capture that creepiness of the individual who has more to show than meets the eye.  Teri Polo, as Travolta's ex-wife, brings believability to her character's desire to see what she wants in her new husband, and ignore the obvious warning signs.If you are looking for a pure escape movie, this is the one.

Sure, we can put down the obvious: the plot is tired, the ending predictable, the silly lines. But other films like this don't have Steve Buscemi!The only saving grace of this film is the acting. Despite John Travolta's cookie cutter role - the ""harm my son and I'll kill you"" lines, for example - he turns in a rather credible performance as a caring father. Given the one-dimensional characters, I think he managed to give the role some depth (as much as possible, anyway).

590349,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005JKQS,D. Litton,"[11, 13]","Stereotypical characters, convoluted logic, and an abundant absence of intelligence abide in &quot;Domestic Disturbance,&quot; a thriller that wants to be naughty, but ends up playing nice. What begins as a somewhat interesting film tailspins into an unending chasm of unbelievable plot twists and aggravating characters who make all the wrong choices. Here is a movie that covers familiar ground, yet it fails to spark much interest once things go awry.John Travolta stars as Frank Morrison, a boat builder whose ex-wife Susan (Teri Polo) is on the brink of remarrying. This, of course, is unacceptable to their 12-year-old son, Danny (Matthew O'Leary), whose outbursts against his parents' divorce have led to being picked up from the police station on numerous occasions. Like any good father, Frank advises Danny to accept that which he cannot change, and to give his new stepfather, the wealthy and popular Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn), a warm welcome.Now anyone who knows their thrillers can guess that if there is money involved, then there's usually a tainted past here and there; this film is no exception. The wedding goes off without a hitch, despite the presence of Ray Coleman (Steve Buscemi), a former acquaintance of Rick's who is set on collecting a large sum of money from his old pal. One thing leads to another, contrivances appear, and Rick has a murder on his hands, unaware that Danny witnessed the deed from the backseat of the car in which it occurred.This is the first in a series of several scenes that look promising, but hold little intensity or surprise. Judging from Danny's &quot;Boy Who Cried Wolf&quot; syndrome, it is easy to foresee that no one will believe him when he reveals what he saw, save for Frank, who must hold a grudge against his son's aggressor if there is to be any action or energy in the story. There's a little bit of cat-and-mouse going on, as Frank searches for the missing Ray and possible clues to take to the police, but it goes virtually nowhere.The movie seems more interested in showing us just how stupid people can be in such situations, however unbelievable they may be. From the start, Susan stands by her man, defending him against Danny's accusations. Does it ever occur to her that when a strange event happens, Rick was out of the house at that same time? Does she ever stop to think about how her disbelief in her son's statements is affecting him, rather than the old song-and-dance about her marriage to Rick? Even the police are completely clueless, ignoring everything until the end when it hardly matters.My big complaint with &quot;Domestic Disturbance&quot; is its editor, who has chopped the movie down to a mere 88 minutes, too short for a thriller and too long for a documentary on vengeful stepfathers. Paramount's advertising campaign for the film hit us with a slew of pre-release television commercials, as well as a lengthy and revealing theatrical trailer. There are scenes in both of these, one of which involves a car chase, the other involving a discussion between Rick and Frank in which Rick tries to buy him off. These and others glimpses are not even included in the final cut, and perhaps may have been more interesting than what we see here.The climax is standard fodder, but it has the ability to generate more intensity than the rest of the film altogether. Travolta turns in a good performance, convincing us of his status as a loving father; Vaughn fails to generate a sense of menace, while Polo does little else except look completely clueless. For all its attributes (which are few), &quot;Domestic Disturbance&quot; adds nothing new to a worn out genre; its lack of lucid plot could be overlooked if not for its failure to generate any level of suspense. 'Note: The film was shot on the eastern coast of North Carolina, in Southport, yet in one scene, Ray mentions his locating Rick was from a childhood memory of Rick's about a family vacation in Maryland.

I'm really sick of Hollywood doing this.  ""What Lies Beneath""'s trailer also did this even worse, and you can practically write the review from the preview.But I'll give the movie a shot on it's own, and it squeaks by with *** (barely).  It tells the story of a broken up family, where John Travolta lives separately from his ex-wife and teenage son.  The ex-wife gets married to Vince Vaughn, who, while seemingly trying to put together a good life, has a past he can't quite escape.  When the son witnesses some very nasty behavior from Vaughn, he seemingly has nobody that believes him, at least for awhile.What I liked most about it was the genuinely scary situation the young son is put in throughout the movie.  The first is where he sees the first act of very nasty behavior.  Put yourself in the situation, which involves a furnace, and you feel for the kid.  As scary is the fact that he has to live with Vaughn when Vaughn finds out that the kid knows about him.  To be helpless in a situation where your life is in real danger is the best part of the movie.I also liked the acting of the three adult male leads (Travolta, Vaughn, and Steve Buscemi).  But where it gets ordinary is what I call the ""Unlawful Entry"" syndrome.  In that movie, and you can probably pick a dozen more, Kurt Russell approaches his problems with Ray Liotta by doing a bunch of emotional, dumb things that only hurt his cause.  In this movie, Travolta, once on the side of his son, commits a daylight kidnapping of the son, which also involves an assault committed by him.  He also shows up drunk at formal dinner attended by Vaughn's new family which also works against him.Then you add that of course the police don't believe the boy, and stop short of conducting a forensics test that would have vindicated him.  Then you add the ""James Bond Syndrome"", where the villian doesn't seem to think it's important to make sure the good guy is dead before leaving the attempted murder scene, you have a plot that becomes ordinary, when it could have been better.  The final inevitable confrontation between Vaughn and Travolta is a well done physical fight, but again it ends with plain dumb luck.Good to see once.",3,Some good scary parts in a very standard plot,1026864000,"07 17, 2002",2002,2305,"[""'m"", 'really', 'tempted', 'trash', 'say', 'just', 'see', 'trailer', 'basically', 'whole', 'plot', ""'m"", 'really', 'sick', 'Hollywood', 'doing', 'What', 'Beneath', 'trailer', 'also', 'did', 'even', 'worse', 'can', 'practically', 'write', 'review', 'preview.But', ""'ll"", 'give', 'movie', 'shot', 'own', '***', 'barely', 'story', 'broken', 'up', 'family', 'where', 'John', 'Travolta', 'separately', 'ex-wife', 'teenage', 'son', 'ex-wife', 'married', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'seemingly', 'trying', 'put', 'together', 'good', 'life', 'past', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'escape', 'When', 'son', 'very', 'nasty', 'behavior', 'Vaughn', 'seemingly', 'nobody', 'least', 'liked', 'most', 'was', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'situation', 'young', 'son', 'put', 'movie', 'first', 'where', 'first', 'act', 'very', 'nasty', 'behavior', 'Put', 'situation', 'furnace', 'feel', 'kid', 'scary', 'fact', 'live', 'Vaughn', 'when', 'Vaughn', 'out', 'kid', 'be', 'helpless', 'situation', 'where', 'life', 'real', 'danger', 'best', 'part', 'movie.I', 'also', 'liked', 'acting', 'three', 'adult', 'male', 'leads', 'Travolta', 'Vaughn', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'where', 'ordinary', 'what', 'call', 'Unlawful', 'Entry', 'syndrome', 'movie', 'can', 'probably', 'pick', 'dozen', 'more', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'problems', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'doing', 'bunch', 'emotional', 'dumb', 'things', 'only', 'hurt', 'cause', 'movie', 'Travolta', 'once', 'side', 'son', 'daylight', 'kidnapping', 'son', 'also', 'assault', 'committed', 'also', 'up', 'drunk', 'formal', 'dinner', 'attended', 'Vaughn', 'new', 'family', 'also', 'him.Then', 'add', 'course', 'police', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'boy', 'stop', 'short', 'conducting', 'forensics', 'test', 'would', 'have', 'vindicated', 'Then', 'add', 'James', 'Bond', 'Syndrome', 'where', 'villian', ""n't"", 'seem', 'think', 'important', 'make', 'sure', 'good', 'guy', 'dead', 'leaving', 'attempted', 'murder', 'scene', 'have', 'plot', 'ordinary', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'final', 'inevitable', 'confrontation', 'Vaughn', 'Travolta', 'well', 'done', 'physical', 'fight', 'again', 'plain', 'dumb', 'luck.Good', 'see', 'once']",N/A

The man has talent, but he needs some serious career counseling.  This script is not even TV grade.  A kid has cried wolf a couple of times so the police don't bother to follow up when he claims he saw his step father murder someone; yes, that's very realistic.  The screenplay would make any Wisconsin dairy farmer proud.  It has so many holes that it is better classified as fantasy/comedy than drama.I'm surprised that this product comes from director Harold Becker (""The Onion Field"", &quot;Malice"") who has given us a couple of fine thrillers.  Besides the flimsy script, the cinematography is annoyingly underexposed.  If Becker was trying for a dark look, he achieved it, because the film is so dark that much of the time you can only tell who's speaking by voice recognition, and that's outdoors during the day!If there is anything that saves this film from the abyss, it is the acting.  Travolta is sometimes fantastic and sometimes awful.  In this film he is very good, especially considering the material with which he has to work.  Matthew O'Leary is particularly good as the troubled son.  He gives a convincing performance, capturing the motivations of his character effectively with all the conflict one would expect from a kid in his situation.  Vince Vaughn gives a decent performance, though he is a bit tentative when trying to be duplicitous.  He is much more convincing as a villain than a good guy.  Steve Buscemi is one of my favorite bad guys, extremely underrated and unappreciated for his consistently sleazy characters.  Again, he gives us a terrifically slimy portrayal of Rick's former underworld buddy.To enjoy this film you have to look beyond the tired plot, the unbelievable departures from reality and the poor cinematography.

There is of course no real suspense since we know who the criminal is and what the end is going to be. The punch line is directed at the police. The chief of police of this small community is just sorry though he voluntarily neglected simple facts and evidence. Amazing how in our modern societies you just need to say you are sorry to be excused even of your worst negligence and incompetence. That's the new version of the Peter's Principle. When you have reached your level of incompetence just say you're sorry and everything will be just okay and go smooth and you will not be considered as responsible for the few dead people along the road.

Bernabo,"[2, 3]","&quot;Domestic Disturbance&quot; is one of those films that belongs to a growing genre of recent Amercian movies in which the main character has to take the law into their own hands because the system cannot or will not provide protection.  Young Danny Morrison (Matthew O'Leary) is not happy when his mother (Teri Polo) gets remarried to Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn).  He is even less happy when he sees Rick commit a murder.  Danny tells his father, Frank (John Travolta), and they tell the police.  With all of the details provided by Danny and all the advantages of 20th century forensics, the police come up with no evidence whatsoever.  But Danny has never lied to his father and Frank keeps coming back to that one fact and refuses to let things drop.&quot;Domestic Disturbance&quot; overloads our repulsion at this situation by having Rick repeatedly threaten Danny, so not only do we have to do with the injustice of the cops being incompetent and/or apathetic, but we have a child in danger as well.  At least his mother turns out not to be a total idiot, which is a good thing, but then it provides additional irritation during the climatic fight scene (this is not a spoiler: if Frank is going to have to take matters into his own hands this is going to involve physical violence).  My problem is that people in movies do not know how to fight.  Everybody has something that they want a nickle for every time they seen it in a movie: I want mine for situations in which a person in peril takes a whack at the bad guy and then drops the implement (skillet, bat, artificial leg, etc.) and runs away giving the villain a chance to recover.  This is why I literally stood up and applauded while watching &quot;24&quot; this season when Jack made his daughter shoot the guy trying to kill her not once but twice.  Get the job done.Ultimately my complaints are more about the plot than the actors, since Travolta and Vaughn are fine as the heroes and villains.  &quot;Domestic Disturbance&quot; is a formula film put together with bits and pieces of things we have seen before and seen done better.  The result is not &quot;great&quot; (five stars) or &quot;good&quot; (four stars), but &quot;okay&quot; (three stars).Oh, and if ever happen to be fighting for your life and you are on top of the person trying to kill you, instead of hitting them in the face with your fist (which is going to hurt you) grab their head by the hair and bang it on concrete.

O'Leary went on to show his incredible range in FRAILTY, but in this movie, he brings his doe-eyed innocence and fervent fear to form the core of the movie.  John Travolta does well as Danny's father, although he sometimes seems overburdened with trying not to act like Pulp Fiction; Vince Vaughn is appropriately menacing as the wicked new stepfather, but we never really understand his motivation for marrying Polo in the first place.  Steve Buscemi shows up in his usual seedy bad guy role, but doesn't get much of a chance to do anything with it.This is an entertaining movie, and works because it attacks our primal fear of something happening to our kids.

590373,A20ZFWGBY4REFX,B00005JKQS,"Nicholas Williams ""movie, music, and book fan""","[15, 15]","Now, THIS is a John Travolta movie! Especially when this movie is called ""Domestic Disturbance"", a movie that is packed with so much action and suspense that it never, never, never lets up from one minute to the next! This is director Harold Becker's (""Mercury Rising"", ""Malice"") best film since he directed Bruce Willis in 1998's ""Mercury Rising""! The rest of the supporting cast, including Vince Vaughn (""The Lost World: Jurassic Park""), Teri Polo (""Meet the Parents""), Steve Buscemi (""Armageddon""), and newcomer Matt O'Leary were all incredible alongside Travolta. But, to me, this is really John Travolta's movie as he stands out above the crowd as Frank Morrison, a successful boat builder and divorced, but loving father to his son Danny (O'Leary). Frank's ex-wife Susan (Polo) is now married to a new resident named Rick Barnes (Vaughn), also Danny's stepfather, whom everyone thinks of as the perfect gentleman and such, but Rick is not so perfect to Danny when he witnesses Rick killing a person and burning his body inside a factory one night. And quite frankly, the only person who will believe Danny is none other than his father, whom Danny has never lied to before. Rick knows that Danny told his father that night and starts making threats to him about it...but Frank will be damned if Rick thinks that he's going to lay a hand on his son! So, Frank goes out to find out the truth about Rick and bring the truth to light, etc. With lots of suspense from start to finish, leading up to a earth-shattering climax between father (Frank) and stepfather (Rick), you'll agree that ""Domestic Disturbance"" is one of the best John Travolta films ever made since ""Swordfish"" and ""The General's Daughter""!

Just when you begin to think it may be decent, you realize it is far from.This B-movie is the story of a divorced father (John Travolta) who's ex-wife is about to remarry. His son is a troubled youth, good at heart but having difficulty dealing with all the changes divorce brings. Then the step father (Vince Vaughn), who appears to be a wonderful guy on the outside, reveals himself to the son his evil, criminal ways and Travolta must step in to save his kid. Sound familiar? It should, it's been done way too many times before. Now, this would be alright if Domestic Disturbance offered something new to the story. Maybe some realistic characters with depth, or maybe some real unique twists. But it doesn't even come close.To begin, all the characters are as flat as can be. No motivation is explained, you're just expected to accept that the step-father is crooked just because he is, and that the ex-husband can't be believed just because he is the ex.Plus the plot holes are horrendous. *Minor spoiler warning* For two years, in this small town, no one realizes that the popular step father is a criminal, yet late in the film Travolta does a 30 second search on the internet and boom! there's an article that explains everything. Then there's the scene where the step father commits a murder in his SUV early in the film. After he quickly wipes up the blood with an old rag, police run tests on the seat and find no signs of blood! Even had he scrubbed it with chemicals, there would still be a trace so soon after.The ending was also a disappointment. The film at least built up some decent suspense, but the climax didn't follow through in the least. And it was the least realistic part of the film.Still, this film is somewhat enjoyable on a guilty pleasure level, hence the three stars. Mostly because it did hold some suspense for most of its running time, and the young actor playing the son was excellent. Better then Travolta and Vaughn combined.

590385,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JKQS,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 10]","If a ""suspense"" filmed was played in the woods, and it didn't actually contain any suspense, would a bear watch it?The previous sentence makes about as much suspense as the reason behind making ""Domestic Disturbance"", the newest `thriller' starring John Travolta, Vince Vaughn and Teri Polo.Let's talk for a few minutes about Mr. Travolta. Can anyone name an actor who has received more chances in his career and squandered them? I think that Travolta has now surpassed Richard Dreyfuss as the comeback/ lose it again king. After a brilliant comeback engineered by his longtime admirer Quentin Tarantino in ""Pulp Fiction"", Travolta appeared in a number of films that were interesting and proved interesting choices. ""Face/Off"" and ""Broken Arrow"" highlighted a string of hits that ultimately allowed Travolta to join the $20 million club. In the last few years, every film Travolta has appeared in has failed miserably. ""Lucky Numbers""? ""The General's Daughter""? That film was a hit but can anyone even remember one significant scene from it? ""Swordfish""? Interesting, but a flop. ""Battlefield Earth""? Why does he keep making this trash? It has to be the paychecks. I can't see any other conceivable reason. John, baby, how long before the studios realize that these films aren't making any money and they stop hiring you? John, baby, how long before you need another comeback vehicle?Frank Morrison (John Travolta) is a divorced father who makes wooden boats. He doesn't get a lot of business, but the business that he does get gets a great deal. He doesn't charge his customers enough to make a profit. Frank does this because HE IS THE GOOD GUY. His son, Danny (Matthew O'Leary) has a lot of problems accepting his mom's (Teri Polo) new relationship with Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn). He gets into a lot of trouble and lies to everyone. A couple of days after his mom and Rick get married, he stows away in Rick's car and witnesses him murdering a business associate. The police don't believe him however. After a little soul searching, Frank believes his son. He may lie to everyone, but he doesn't lie to Frank.Directed by Harold Becker (""Sea of Love""), ""Domestic Disturbance"" is a suspense film without any suspense. From the moment Danny stows away in Rick's car and WATCHES HIM MURDER Ray (Steve Buscemi), which we also watch, we know who the good guy is and who the bad guy is. To make matters worse, Frank instantly believes his son, which means that the film boils down to a cat and mouse game between Frank and Rick. A boring cat and mouse game. When you know the identity of the villain, a huge percentage of the suspense is flushed down the toilet. When Frank believes Danny early on, the rest of the suspense is flushed down with it.The film would've been greatly improved by showing Danny in the backseat of the car, watching everything, the pain and suspense registering on his face, while the audience sees nothing. Then, when Danny tries to convince his dad, the police chief, his mom, that Rick is a murderer, at least we haven't seen the act, and we would require some convincing as well.Because the filmmakers chose to show us everything, the next logical step to provide some suspense would be to have Frank doubt Danny, his son. However, after a very brief segment, Frank believes Danny, causing us to watch a battle between Frank and Rick, which isn't very interesting.Each of the actors, including Travolta, are serviceable in their roles, but because the film robs us of just about everything in the first fifteen minutes, the remaining ninety become an exercise in tedium.Skip ""Domestic Disturbance"". It isn't even worthy of a video rental. Go to see the far superior and very different ""Amelie"" or ""The Man Who Wasn't There"".

Nevertheless, Travolta is always able to bring his charm and personal touch to any part, and to give it the warmth of a real person.Here he plays Frank Morrison, a boat builder who learns that his ex wife's new husband is not the man he pretends to be. In fact, it is no other then Danny, Frank's son who now lives with this man, who blames him to be a murderer. If only the viewer did not know that Danny is right...we could have been in a better position to understand Frank's hesitation in believing his son. However, in this movie, the viewer is always a little ahead of the actual heroes and thus the tension is not a matter of &quot;did he&quot; or &quot;didn't he&quot; do it, but rather a feeling of &quot;can't you see he is telling the truth...&quot;The story line is somewhat predicted as we are all familiar with movies uncovering a villain's true face, including all the slow gathering of evidence. We are even familiar with the &quot;real face&quot; being uncovered by the person most unlikely to do so, such as in this movie. However, even if you know for sure that the end will be good and the bad will be punished for their deeds (or rather, that someone will believe the &quot;good&quot;), this is a real thriller that keeps you sitting at the edge of your seat.Other actors do not stand out as much.
