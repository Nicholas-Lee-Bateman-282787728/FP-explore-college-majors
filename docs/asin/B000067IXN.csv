I was tired of getting movies that were not any good so I was looking for stars that I enjoy.I was so surprised. LDP plays a bad guy and does it so well.This is one that turned out to be fun and I am so glad I bought it.I always like Robert Forster and He was great also.,4,this was fun,1190246400,"09 20, 2007",2007,356,"['got', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'was', 'it.I', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'was', 'tired', 'getting', 'movies', 'were', 'not', 'good', 'was', 'looking', 'stars', 'enjoy.I', 'was', 'so', 'surprised', 'LDP', 'bad', 'guy', 'well.This', 'one', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'fun', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'bought', 'it.I', 'always', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'was', 'great', 'also']",Lone Hero
702810,A2G0X4DYLN6VPU,B000067IXN,Joshua Craig,"[1, 1]","Lone hero is one of those movies that proves you don't need a big budget to make a enjoyable movie. Lou diamond phillips is great as the leader of the iron bandits. He plays the bad guy very well and has some great lines. And sean patrick flanery is great as the reluctant hero. The movie never gets bogged down either moving at a pretty consistent pace with plenty of action along the way all leading to the eventual shoot out between the iron bandits and townspeople. Lone hero is a great movie to pop in when you don't want to think to hard or be amazed by multi million dollar effects. To me it has everything a good movie needs memorable heroes and villians, good writing with some memorable lines and a decent amount of action delivered at a steady pace.",4,a nice surprise,1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,760,"['Lone', 'hero', 'one', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'big', 'budget', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'Lou', 'diamond', 'phillips', 'great', 'leader', 'iron', 'bandits', 'bad', 'guy', 'very', 'well', 'great', 'lines', 'sean', 'patrick', 'flanery', 'great', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'movie', 'never', 'bogged', 'down', 'either', 'moving', 'pretty', 'consistent', 'pace', 'plenty', 'action', 'way', 'leading', 'eventual', 'shoot', 'iron', 'bandits', 'townspeople', 'Lone', 'hero', 'great', 'movie', 'pop', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'think', 'hard', 'be', 'amazed', 'multi', 'million', 'dollar', 'effects', 'everything', 'good', 'movie', 'needs', 'memorable', 'heroes', 'villians', 'good', 'writing', 'memorable', 'lines', 'decent', 'amount', 'action', 'delivered', 'steady', 'pace']",Lone Hero

For some reason Hollywood seems to think that the only way to make a guy seem tough is to have them say the ""F"" word & ""G D"" over and over again.  Almost all the bikes were Hondas, most were Honda Magnas and Shadows.  The Harley at the end of the movie did not seem to be in the rest of the movie and there was one HD Sportster, with a long front end, but if there were any other HD's I missed them. Boy, these were some big tough bikers on their 750 Honda's.",3,Wanabe Bikers,1225756800,"11 4, 2008",2008,569,"['acting', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'was', 'alright', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Philips', 'play', 'bad', 'guy', 'reason', 'Hollywood', 'think', 'only', 'way', 'make', 'guy', 'seem', 'tough', 'have', 'say', 'F', 'word', 'G', 'D', 'over', 'again', 'Almost', 'bikes', 'were', 'Hondas', 'most', 'were', 'Honda', 'Magnas', 'Shadows', 'Harley', 'end', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'HD', 'Sportster', 'long', 'front', 'end', 'were', 'other', 'HD', 'missed', 'Boy', 'were', 'big', 'tough', 'bikers', '750', 'Honda']",Lone Hero
