It's ends with the death of Patton.Extremely well made. They used archival footage and tossed in some very good computer graphics to fill in gaps and brought back many of the actual men who served under Patton for new interviews as the events unfolded. Very well done and presented. I must say too, enjoy this and this type of series while we still can. Those brave men who served in WW2 are now in their late 80's to 90's, 10 years from now, this series will be impossible to make as there sadly won't be any survivors left.If you are a war buff, a patriot, a historian or just want to watch some GOOD....get this DVD set.

1222604,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,B001OLP2T8,CGScammell,"[15, 16]","I bought this video for my husband who is a big fan of Patton and could recite every one of his quotes.  I ordered this on 22 November and received it today.  Within 30 minutes my husband had the DVD in his player to watch it.The combination of both archival news footage and computer graphics had me pulled into the battle as soon as I heard the tank rounds explode in the TV room.This DVD set of three discs runs over seven hours long.  The story, narration and scenery pull you into the battle.  Tank rounds never stop exploding in the background as you go from scratchy video to CGI to talking heads and back to scratchy video as the battle goes on, as if in real time. And, like zooming in and out with Google Earth, you get to see aerial views of the battlefield as well as lateral shots and ground shots.  Old-looking maps of the warfront show the US and Nazi armies moving toward each other in the Benelux area.The transformation between film footage and CGI is continuous, as the CGI helps continue the battle scenes.  You may see one scene of a tank getting hit.  That very same tank then turns into a computer-enhanced graphic that turns around and fires a shot back.  This is thrilling, exciting and scary all rolled into one!Between battle scenes old veterans of this battle retell their version of the fight.  This is classic History Channel quality.  Even the narrator sounds so History Channelish.My husband gives this production five stars, I give it four.  My complaint is the background superimposition of what looks like an old compass dial coming at you while you are listening to a veteran retell his story, or a historian comment on the action.  It's not noticable at first, but in most every archival footage there is that compass dial coming at you like shooting stars or snow aiming for the camera.  What is that all about?  My husband was so engrossed in the story he says it didn't bother him, but to me it was annoying.  This did not take away from the subject matter, though:  Patton was an amazing strategist.Thus, from two history fans, 4+ stars.

1222605,A3RDGQ1S04HJVE,B001OLP2T8,chcjrbone,"[3, 9]","This series has several serious problems.First, the background music is so loud and pounding, it actually drowns out the narration. This was especially true at the beginning of the ""American Blitzkrieg"" episode. Couldn't an editor have actually watched this episode before burning it on the DVD? For the other episodes, I missed probably 50% of the narration due to the excessive volume of the background music. And note: there are NO SUBTITLES.Not that the breathless narration was informative. It mostly takes the form of U.S. government propaganda films of the era, you know, the dirty Nazi krauts have backed the fearless true-blue Americans in a corner, but due to the American bravery and plain ole goodness, they overcome the odds and are victorious!About the only relief to be found is during the expert interviews. Even here, things are uneven. Several no-name military guys in uniform give their opinions, what do they know? On the other hand, the editors had the wisdom to feature Rick Atkinson, author of the excellent books, ""An Army at Dawn"" and ""The Day of Battle.""As other reviewers have noted, the repetitive use of computer graphics is amateurish and not even that realistic. It's as though they had to do something to fill up the time and three DVDs.Which brings me to my biggest complaint: the series is an inefficient use of time. They use ten episodes to explain what could have been done in maybe two. I'm reminded of Christian preachers who need to fill up sermon time and so they use ten words to explain what could have been explained in two.

""Old Blood'n Guts"" General Patton in spite of his obvious character flaws, notable disdain for authority along the infamous 'slapping incident' was probably the only man that could have achieved what he did. Patton's ""Lust for Glory"" was undoubtably what drove him to the victories he acheived and was perhaps the right, and only General that could have done this.A few of the CG effects were a bit bland of the land conflicts and tank battles, but most other re-enacted scenes based on eye witness accounts and records remain unparalleled similary to the aforementioned in this series by the History Channel.highly recommended.",4,Patton 360,1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,963,"['Not', 'repeat', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'written', '360', 'somewhat', 'same', 'vein', 'Battle', '360', 'Season', '1', 'catalogue', 'Carrier', 'Enterprise', 'involvement', 'Pacifc', 'conflict', 'Patton', '360', 'equally', 'battle', 'must', 'history', 'fanatics', 'Patton', 'historians', 'serious', 'students', 'era', 'Old', 'Blood', 'n', 'Guts', 'General', 'Patton', 'spite', 'obvious', 'character', 'flaws', 'notable', 'disdain', 'authority', 'infamous', ""'slapping"", 'incident', 'was', 'probably', 'only', 'man', 'could', 'have', 'achieved', 'what', 'did', 'Patton', 'Lust', 'Glory', 'was', 'undoubtably', 'what', 'drove', 'victories', 'acheived', 'was', 'perhaps', 'right', 'only', 'General', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'this.A', 'few', 'CG', 'effects', 'were', 'bit', 'bland', 'land', 'conflicts', 'tank', 'battles', 'most', 'other', 're-enacted', 'scenes', 'based', 'eye', 'witness', 'accounts', 'records', 'remain', 'unparalleled', 'similary', 'aforementioned', 'series', 'History', 'Channel.highly', 'recommended']",Patton 360: The Complete Season 1
