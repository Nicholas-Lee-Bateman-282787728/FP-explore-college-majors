Went,"[0, 0]","Whilst I admit that this season was, in my view, a little lacklustre, it still features the first time the show went to Cambodia, which was a highlight for me, and many other interesting spots. I found that I didn't really like or engage with any of the teams much this season- the pushy wife and her athletic husband, who seemed to be trying to prove to her that he was good husband despite past transgressions, the two dimensional Nick and Starr, the weird nerdy frat boys... I dunno, they just didn't do it for me. BUT the show itself is always fabulous and it's great that more seasons are being released.",5,Great to have more Amazing Race seasons on DVD,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,609,"['Whilst', 'admit', 'season', 'was', 'view', 'little', 'lacklustre', 'still', 'first', 'time', 'show', 'went', 'Cambodia', 'was', 'highlight', 'many', 'other', 'interesting', 'spots', 'found', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'engage', 'teams', 'much', 'season-', 'pushy', 'wife', 'athletic', 'husband', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'trying', 'prove', 'was', 'good', 'husband', 'past', 'transgressions', 'two', 'dimensional', 'Nick', 'Starr', 'weird', 'nerdy', 'frat', 'boys', 'dunno', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'show', 'always', 'fabulous', 'great', 'more', 'seasons', 'are', 'being', 'released']","The Amazing Race, S13"

The competition can sometimes become unfriendly but the scenery is beautiful and the challenges fun to watch.
