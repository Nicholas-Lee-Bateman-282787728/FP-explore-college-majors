1505195,A2IWPUK181NIA,B005XB8SPK,"Cody Shay ""Big Yami No Matsuei Fan..""","[1, 1]","I've heard about ef for a few years now and it always sounded like something I would enjoy.  However, so much time went by that I figured it would never get picked up.  Luckily for us, Sentai swooped in and picked it up.  Not only did they release it on bluray but they also gave it one of the finest dubs in recent memory out of Texas.First of all, I have to say that the word ""Masterpiece"" gets thrown around a lot in anime.  I've heard it applied more than once to ef and I have to say this is one of the few cases where I think it truly fits.  The show is emotional and moving, without the feeling that it's constantly screaming ""Cry Damn It! Cry!"" like so many other series, like Air, Saikano, or even Clannad at times.  The touches are subtle and don't beat you over the head.  You need to pay attention to pick everything up, which is quite easy considering how easily this show sucks you in.  I quickly marathoned through the entire series, which is something I rarely do.Now as for the dub, I've seen some criticisms of it and I have to say that I can't disagree more.  ef is one of the most expertly cast dubs to come out in recent memory, and I'm become pretty picky when it comes to casting and acting in dubs.  I love that Sentai and Seraphim get the fact that casting a character isn't just about choosing someone who sounds just like the Japanese VA.  It's about how they can convey the character and their emotions.  This is a lesson I wish some other dubbing studios would learn.  Funimation, Bang Zoom and others have ruined dubs because they cast simply on the sound of an actor's voice and failed to realize that the American actor simply couldn't capture the emotion and range needed for the character.  Who cares if the actors sound alike if one just isn't up to the task?The video quality is superb.  It's not quite as 100% flawless as some of Sentai's other recent releases like Angel Beats, but it's look amazing.  There are occasional flaws in the video, such as extremely light digital artifacts, but you could count the total number on one hand and still have a few fingers left over.  And like all recent Sentai blurays, the audio is 100% lossless DTS Master HD Audio.  With a decent receiver and speakers, it sounds just as great as it looks.I simply can't say enough good things about ef or it's dub.  I realize tastes are entirely subjective, but if you enjoyed Angel Beats, Kanon, Clannad, or other Key Arts works, then you should definitely give it a try.",5,A Series That Deserves All The Hype!,1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,2489,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'ef', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'always', 'sounded', 'something', 'would', 'enjoy', 'However', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'went', 'figured', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'picked', 'up', 'Luckily', 'Sentai', 'swooped', 'picked', 'up', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'release', 'bluray', 'also', 'gave', 'one', 'finest', 'dubs', 'recent', 'memory', 'Texas.First', 'have', 'say', 'word', 'Masterpiece', 'thrown', 'lot', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'applied', 'more', 'once', 'ef', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'few', 'cases', 'where', 'think', 'truly', 'show', 'emotional', 'moving', 'feeling', 'constantly', 'screaming', 'Cry', 'Damn', 'Cry', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'series', 'Air', 'Saikano', 'even', 'Clannad', 'times', 'touches', 'are', 'subtle', 'do', ""n't"", 'beat', 'head', 'need', 'pay', 'attention', 'pick', 'everything', 'up', 'quite', 'easy', 'considering', 'how', 'easily', 'show', 'quickly', 'marathoned', 'entire', 'series', 'something', 'rarely', 'do.Now', 'dub', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'criticisms', 'have', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'more', 'ef', 'one', 'most', 'expertly', 'cast', 'dubs', 'come', 'out', 'recent', 'memory', ""'m"", 'become', 'pretty', 'picky', 'when', 'casting', 'acting', 'dubs', 'love', 'Sentai', 'Seraphim', 'get', 'fact', 'casting', 'character', ""n't"", 'just', 'choosing', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'Japanese', 'VA', 'how', 'can', 'convey', 'character', 'emotions', 'lesson', 'wish', 'other', 'dubbing', 'studios', 'would', 'learn', 'Funimation', 'Bang', 'Zoom', 'others', 'have', 'ruined', 'dubs', 'cast', 'simply', 'sound', 'actor', 'voice', 'failed', 'realize', 'American', 'actor', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'capture', 'emotion', 'range', 'needed', 'character', 'Who', 'actors', 'sound', 'alike', 'one', 'just', ""n't"", 'up', 'task', 'video', 'quality', 'superb', 'not', 'quite', '100', '%', 'flawless', 'Sentai', 'other', 'recent', 'releases', 'Angel', 'Beats', 'look', 'amazing', 'are', 'occasional', 'flaws', 'video', 'such', 'extremely', 'light', 'digital', 'artifacts', 'could', 'count', 'total', 'number', 'one', 'hand', 'still', 'have', 'few', 'fingers', 'left', 'over', 'recent', 'Sentai', 'blurays', 'audio', '100', '%', 'lossless', 'DTS', 'Master', 'HD', 'Audio', 'decent', 'receiver', 'speakers', 'just', 'as', 'great', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'ef', 'dub', 'realize', 'tastes', 'are', 'entirely', 'subjective', 'enjoyed', 'Angel', 'Beats', 'Kanon', 'Clannad', 'other', 'Key', 'Arts', 'works', 'then', 'should', 'definitely', 'give', 'try']",ef: A Tale of Memories Complete Collection

1505198,A1ITY7MPAFKMXH,B005XB8SPK,Kohinata99,"[19, 19]","I watched this anime a long time ago and it's one of the great ones out there! Like Clannad, it's based on an original visual novel game, ""Ef-A Fairytale of the two."" It's romantic and psychological. The only thing I don't really like is the sort of ""darkness"" present in this anime. But I guess that's why the show is so great. The ending is good too, but I won't spoil it. I'm mostly looking forward to hearing the new English dub with many actors I've seen in previous animes released by Sentai. Nagisa Furukawa from Clannad and Haruko Kamio from Air will voice Miyako. Ryou Fujibayashi from Clannad, Ayu from Kanon and Yuri from Angel Beats doing Kei's. Greg Ayres who voices Sunohara from Clannad doing Hiro's. Mizuzu from Air will do Chihiro's voice, Fuko Ibuki from Clannad will do Mizuki's voice, and Yoshino Yusuke from Clannad playing Kazuya's voice (correct me if I got his name wrong). I'm so excited that I know how the characters will sound like before the anime, but too bad we have to wait an entire month until it's released. The opening song (euphoric field sung by ELISA) and second ending song are catchy too. If you buy this anime and it impresses you, don't forget to pick up the sequal season, ef-a tale of melodies which in my opinion, is even darker and kinda more disturbing than this season.",5,A great anime finally released in English!,1324944000,"12 27, 2011",2011,1318,"['watched', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'one', 'great', 'ones', 'there', 'Clannad', 'based', 'original', 'visual', 'novel', 'game', 'Ef-A', 'Fairytale', 'two', 'romantic', 'psychological', 'only', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'sort', 'darkness', 'present', 'anime', 'guess', 'why', 'show', 'so', 'great', 'ending', 'good', 'too', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', ""'m"", 'mostly', 'looking', 'forward', 'hearing', 'new', 'English', 'dub', 'many', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'previous', 'animes', 'released', 'Sentai', 'Nagisa', 'Furukawa', 'Clannad', 'Haruko', 'Kamio', 'Air', 'will', 'voice', 'Miyako', 'Ryou', 'Fujibayashi', 'Clannad', 'Ayu', 'Kanon', 'Yuri', 'Angel', 'Beats', 'doing', 'Kei', 'Greg', 'Ayres', 'who', 'Sunohara', 'Clannad', 'doing', 'Hiro', 'Mizuzu', 'Air', 'will', 'do', 'Chihiro', 'voice', 'Fuko', 'Ibuki', 'Clannad', 'will', 'do', 'Mizuki', 'voice', 'Yoshino', 'Yusuke', 'Clannad', 'playing', 'Kazuya', 'voice', 'correct', 'got', 'name', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'so', 'excited', 'know', 'how', 'characters', 'will', 'sound', 'anime', 'too', 'bad', 'have', 'wait', 'entire', 'month', 'released', 'opening', 'song', 'euphoric', 'field', 'sung', 'ELISA', 'second', 'ending', 'song', 'are', 'catchy', 'too', 'buy', 'anime', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'pick', 'up', 'sequal', 'season', 'ef-a', 'tale', 'melodies', 'opinion', 'even', 'darker', 'kinda', 'more', 'disturbing', 'season']",ef: A Tale of Memories Complete Collection
