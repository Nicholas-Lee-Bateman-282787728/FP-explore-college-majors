I like the way the characters were portrayed and even shed a tear in the end when the girls spirit was finally released. I highly recommend that others give this movie a try.

1603048,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B009XICUB2,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[6, 6]","Be With Me, aka Ghost, is a South Korean horror anthology that follows three girls that are told their fortunes and are told to expect a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity after they chant their name 3 times in front of a mirror. Each story has a ghost theme, all of them using horror as their main element, the first and last story use some comedy. Be With Me is a great horror anthology.I enjoyed all of the stories in this film. The first story has three students sent into an old school by the seniors and they have to find a ghost. This film uses haunting imagery of ghosts, plenty of jump scares, and some funny moments throughout. The second story follows a young pregnant student and her very close friend. This story doesn't use ghost or jump-scares as often nor does it use any comedy; this story is slower paced, deeper, and has a strong buildup to its ending, making it much more haunting and impactful than the rest. The final story follows another young student that can see ghosts; he befriends a friendly ghost that is still being hunted by her murder. This one also uses ghosts and some funny moments. This story reaches a bit further into the unique and creative zone. I didn't love the frame story, but it got the job done; it was a little confusing due to the lack of a fulfilling explanations, and the subtitles could've been better during these scenes. It's not the scariest film ever, but it packs a few great scares. The acting was great in all of the stories.Overall, Be With Me is a great horror anthology. All of the stories are enjoyable, some scarier than others and some with comedy elements. (don't expect a horror/comedy, I mean it has some funny moments but it never really feels like a real comedy) as of 2/19/13, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video, a purchase is recommended for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.Be With Me has some violence and blood.",4,A Great Horror Anthology...,1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,1905,"['Be', 'Me', 'Ghost', 'South', 'Korean', 'horror', 'anthology', 'three', 'girls', 'are', 'told', 'fortunes', 'are', 'told', 'expect', 'once-in-a-lifetime', 'opportunity', 'chant', 'name', '3', 'times', 'front', 'mirror', 'story', 'ghost', 'theme', 'using', 'horror', 'main', 'element', 'first', 'last', 'story', 'comedy', 'Be', 'Me', 'great', 'horror', 'anthology.I', 'enjoyed', 'stories', 'film', 'first', 'story', 'three', 'students', 'sent', 'old', 'school', 'seniors', 'have', 'find', 'ghost', 'film', 'haunting', 'imagery', 'ghosts', 'plenty', 'jump', 'scares', 'funny', 'moments', 'second', 'story', 'young', 'pregnant', 'student', 'very', 'close', 'friend', 'story', ""n't"", 'use', 'ghost', 'jump-scares', 'often', 'use', 'comedy', 'story', 'slower', 'paced', 'deeper', 'strong', 'buildup', 'ending', 'making', 'much', 'more', 'haunting', 'impactful', 'rest', 'final', 'story', 'young', 'student', 'can', 'see', 'ghosts', 'friendly', 'ghost', 'still', 'being', 'hunted', 'murder', 'one', 'also', 'ghosts', 'funny', 'moments', 'story', 'bit', 'further', 'unique', 'creative', 'zone', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'frame', 'story', 'got', 'job', 'done', 'was', 'little', 'confusing', 'due', 'lack', 'fulfilling', 'explanations', 'subtitles', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'scenes', 'not', 'scariest', 'film', 'ever', 'few', 'great', 'scares', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'stories.Overall', 'Be', 'Me', 'great', 'horror', 'anthology', 'stories', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'scarier', 'others', 'comedy', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'horror/comedy', 'mean', 'funny', 'moments', 'never', 'really', 'feels', 'real', 'comedy', '2/19/13', 'film', 'available', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'Instant', 'Video', 'purchase', 'recommended', 'fans', 'genre', 'rental', 'otherwise.Be', 'Me', 'violence', 'blood']",Be With Me
1603049,AEWAJRKEL38X9,B009XICUB2,"LM ""You are entitled to your INFORMED opinion...","[1, 1]","I did not go into this film expecting anything great; I just hoped to be entertained.  Overall, I was.  I did not find the three stories great by any means, but the second and third one entertained and touched me more than I expected them to.That said, to me it is obvious that these are films by relatively inexperienced (or at least they are imo) directors, but they do not do badly with what budgets they had.  The acting was pretty good and I liked how, despite this being a foreign film to me, did not alienate me with too many subtitles.  I had an easy time following the plots and was not overwhelmed with the subtitles at all.Addressing the ""frame story"" I was disappointed with such an over-used formula.  It is pretty cliche by now, but I suppose finding another to tie in these stories would have been difficult.  It also does not ""resolve"" itself or even give a reason for being there other than to tie such separate stories together.  That knocked me out of that particular element of the film in an almost ""fourth wall"" way.As to the stories themselves, they were not bad.  The first one left me disappointed and felt too formulaic, imo.The second was very moving, touching, sad, yet had a wonderful ending that not only surprised me a bit, but left me feeling that that was the way it SHOULD have ended!  Sometimes betrayed love gets its own back in the end in a unique way that is satisfying.The final story had humour and some tense moments (but nothing to make me jump) and I really loved the actors in it, especially the cute girl ghost.  You learn something significant about one of the characters who comes off as totally different from what he appears at first.  It was a moving, funny at times, and well-done little story that I really enjoyed.All in all, I am not certain I would purchase this film, but perhaps if it is offered relatively cheaply (I saw it for free on Amazon Prime) I may.  For fans of the genre, like me, I liked it well enough that I would not mind seeing it again.Overall, not a great film by any means, but one I would recommend watching at least once.",3,Has some decent entertainment,1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,2098,"['did', 'not', 'go', 'film', 'expecting', 'anything', 'great', 'just', 'hoped', 'be', 'entertained', 'Overall', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'three', 'stories', 'great', 'means', 'second', 'third', 'one', 'entertained', 'touched', 'more', 'expected', 'said', 'obvious', 'are', 'films', 'relatively', 'inexperienced', 'least', 'are', 'imo', 'directors', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'badly', 'what', 'budgets', 'had', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'liked', 'how', 'being', 'foreign', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'alienate', 'too', 'many', 'subtitles', 'had', 'easy', 'time', 'following', 'plots', 'was', 'not', 'overwhelmed', 'subtitles', 'all.Addressing', 'frame', 'story', 'was', 'disappointed', 'such', 'over-used', 'formula', 'pretty', 'cliche', 'now', 'suppose', 'finding', 'tie', 'stories', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'also', 'not', 'resolve', 'even', 'give', 'reason', 'being', 'other', 'tie', 'such', 'separate', 'stories', 'together', 'knocked', 'particular', 'element', 'film', 'almost', 'fourth', 'wall', 'way.As', 'stories', 'were', 'not', 'bad', 'first', 'one', 'left', 'disappointed', 'felt', 'too', 'formulaic', 'imo.The', 'second', 'was', 'very', 'moving', 'touching', 'sad', 'yet', 'had', 'wonderful', 'ending', 'not', 'only', 'surprised', 'bit', 'left', 'feeling', 'was', 'way', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'ended', 'Sometimes', 'betrayed', 'love', 'own', 'back', 'end', 'unique', 'way', 'satisfying.The', 'final', 'story', 'had', 'humour', 'tense', 'moments', 'nothing', 'make', 'jump', 'really', 'loved', 'actors', 'especially', 'cute', 'girl', 'ghost', 'learn', 'something', 'significant', 'one', 'characters', 'who', 'off', 'totally', 'different', 'what', 'first', 'was', 'moving', 'funny', 'times', 'well-done', 'little', 'story', 'really', 'enjoyed.All', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'would', 'purchase', 'film', 'perhaps', 'offered', 'relatively', 'cheaply', 'saw', 'free', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'may', 'fans', 'genre', 'liked', 'well', 'would', 'not', 'mind', 'seeing', 'again.Overall', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'means', 'one', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'least', 'once']",Be With Me
