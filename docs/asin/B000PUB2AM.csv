1072931,AFH39CEQQZ9JB,B000PUB2AM,Bradley Stephenson,"[7, 7]","I really enjoyed this and though that the two 40 minute programs were worth the cost of the DVD (even though some content is repeated). However I really would have liked a little more information on Qi Gong in general, it's history, practice and more specifically what defines it from Tai Chi which about 40% of the content on this disk appears to be.Having practised Yoga for almost 8 years I was also left wanting more instructions on breath. Mind you there is constant narration of ""breathe in / out"" but I'm sure there must be more to it than that. Was given the impression that the breathing was through the nose but then I noticed several times that Matthew Cohen is opening his mouth and it's unclear if he's performing some kind of Qi Gong / Tai Chi breathing or even if he's out of breath.Something else that became obvious after a while was that the woman seemed to be positioning her body differently than Matthew a lot of the time. i.e. leaning forward more, arms straight while his were almost bent at 90 degree angles and sitting with her waist just above knee level while Matthew would sit all the way down parallel or under his knees. Also despite instructing the viewer to place their feet at ""shoulder width"", both his and his assistant's feet are placed way wider than that (at least by my Yoga training).I must stress that I'm glad I bought this. It's very well made and I really liked the extra on hand mudras (most of which I hadn't seen before) but if you're after more detailed instruction you may be disappointed.",3,Good but missing something?,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,1538,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'two', '40', 'minute', 'programs', 'were', 'worth', 'cost', 'DVD', 'even', 'content', 'repeated', 'However', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'little', 'more', 'information', 'Qi', 'Gong', 'general', 'history', 'practice', 'more', 'specifically', 'what', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'about', '40', '%', 'content', 'disk', 'be.Having', 'practised', 'Yoga', 'almost', '8', 'years', 'was', 'also', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'instructions', 'breath', 'Mind', 'constant', 'narration', 'breathe', '/', ""'m"", 'sure', 'must', 'be', 'more', 'Was', 'given', 'impression', 'breathing', 'was', 'nose', 'then', 'noticed', 'several', 'times', 'Matthew', 'Cohen', 'opening', 'mouth', 'unclear', 'performing', 'kind', 'Qi', 'Gong', '/', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'breathing', 'even', 'breath.Something', 'else', 'became', 'obvious', 'while', 'was', 'woman', 'seemed', 'be', 'positioning', 'body', 'differently', 'Matthew', 'lot', 'time', 'i.e', 'leaning', 'forward', 'more', 'arms', 'straight', 'were', 'almost', 'bent', '90', 'degree', 'angles', 'sitting', 'waist', 'just', 'knee', 'level', 'Matthew', 'would', 'sit', 'way', 'down', 'parallel', 'knees', 'Also', 'instructing', 'viewer', 'place', 'feet', 'shoulder', 'width', 'assistant', 'feet', 'are', 'placed', 'way', 'wider', 'least', 'Yoga', 'training', '.I', 'must', 'stress', ""'m"", 'glad', 'bought', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'really', 'liked', 'extra', 'hand', 'mudras', 'most', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', ""'re"", 'more', 'detailed', 'instruction', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed']",Qi Gong Fire & Water With Matthew Cohen

His narration holds up to months of repeated viewings. Fire Qi Gong works better for me than water though some water moves and poses are great. I spent time with some other Qi Gong DVDs like the Garipolis. They were good but have different emphases than Matthew Cohen. This one is more full body and I consistently felt significantly MORE Qi after a fire workout than with other DVDs. It develops balance in a big way and after doing it for a few weeks, I felt more energetic, centered and flexible. Both mentally and physically. I've been doing it now for about a year. Usually do it right before bed and it helps me get more restful sleep. I wake up sometimes with an intense body energy the next morning depending on the intensity of the workout the night before.The production on this DVD is also really well done. Great camera work. Great narration. Great setting - the hills. It has a grandness and vastness that is inspiring. Good music. Not too interesting or distracting but mysterious, stimulating and relaxing.

I've only done the ""fire"" part, haven't done the water part yet. The instructor explains things very well and I think it's a good dvd for beginners as well as more advanced.There is a first part where he talks and explains the moves, then you can also go go a part where you can just go thru the moves and not hear his voice.  There was a part marked ""music only"" but there is nothing there so I don't know what that's about.You need a good amount of leg strength to do this dvd.  His only suggestion for modification is either standing up straighter if you want less, or bending your knees more if you want more.  However, I have been doing some of it sitting on an exercise ball because alot of the moves, at least in the ""fire"" part, are just arms anyway, so standing for a really long period of time with knees bent just to do arm movements didn't seem beneficial to me personally.But all in all, I think it was worth the money and a good dvd.

1072941,A2NTYK9JC5H0LS,B000PUB2AM,Sarah Sheikh,"[1, 1]","Beautifully filmed with amazing inspirational scenery of California's Alabama hills as the backdrop for Matthew's masterful practice, I felt reeled in from the start of the DVD. Matthew's instructional style is everything I admire in a teacher:- concise, inspirational, clear, comprehensive, graceful yet dynamic. His wisdom and expertise create a strong body of teachings to provide a solid foundation for Qi Gong in your life. There are two routines to choose from:- Fire & Water, and I really love this approach, as the elements of nature, of life, do deeply affect us, and also the fire routine may be more suitable earlier in the day, whilst the water routine may be rather lovely for the evening time practice. The background music is multilayered, weaving wonderful tones that deeply enhance the dynamic approach to Qi Gong, with wonderful earthly sounds grounding you deep into your physical body, as Matthew weaves the magic of his unique energetic style through each routine. I love the running commentary style, where he offers so much advice on each position, you are never left wondering what to do or how, as everything is so perfectly explained. The programmes are 40 minutes each, hence the DVD is approx. 80 minutes in duration, in colour, stereo and 16:9 widescreen. Matthew discusses detoxification and the elements such as the metal element. Each section within the main programme is clearly titled, and I found this is a great addition. The fire programme menu includes a free-form demonstration - including a free form improvisation of Monkey Kung Fu and Ba Ua. Matthew is simply stunning in this highly energetic routine. If you are not excited yet by Qi Gong, watch this and see where your practice might lead one day, if you choose! Matthews style is shamanic based by appearance, and he has such deep physical alignment in the most poised manner. A section on mudras is included from taoist and hatha yoga.Matthew aligns the spiritual with the physical in sublime synergy, allowing a deep unfoldment of core awareness within your being. The second programme of water is filmed with slightly different background scenery as beautiful as the first. A beautiful addition to the lush background music is the sound of running water, somehow aiding your visualisation and alignment to the water element. The second routine is flows beautifully, and is reminiscent of water, gentle, all encompassing, refreshing, and calm. Beautiful vocals commence approximately at 6 minutes into the water programme, further enhancing the beauty of Qi Gong. Matthew discusses balance and how the balance achieved within the Qi Gong practice will benefit balance in your life in general, as one corresponds and is linked to the other. The water programme menu also includes Ba Gua demonstration, a uniquely dynamic interpretation of the Iching by Matthew, including fast and artfully beautiful movements that depict the strength of a warrior (he is also trained in martial arts). It is difficult to take your eyes off of him! Mesmerising!Qi Gong Fire & Water is accessible for the beginner, but can be enjoyed by intermediate and advanced levels also, as this DVD appears to offer something for everyone at every level.

1072943,A1Z8HAH2FJAATJ,B000PUB2AM,TreeDogRain,"[4, 4]","This is a gorgeous instructional DVD, and a pleasure on every level. Matthew Cohen's instruction is clear and simple, with never a wasted word, and yet he never sounds like he's dumbing-down his insights into this profound and at times esoteric practice. And -- joy! -- his voice is calm and relaxing. Both practices (about 40 minutes total each) end with a seated meditation, and I only wish those meditations were longer. Both practices also have chapter headings for skipping around, though I've never been tempted to do so.What I most enjoy about this is the thought that went into the production. The stunning outdoor setting somehow enhances the simplicity of the practices. Using voice-over instruction, Cohen performs both practices with another instructor; her equally calm presence and mirroring offers the eye and mind another place to learn from and study. Every visual detail seems to have been considered in advance. To name just two: i) the timing of the day (stunning morning light for the Fire practice; dusk-evening light for the more calming Water practice), and ii) crane shots that enhance the instruction by letting us see different angles than would be available to us if we were standing directly in front. Some 'jazzy' quick cutting here and there (the disc has a couple of free-form practice demonstration chapters separate from the instruction), but overall the artistic direction is sophisticated, subtle and unobtrusive. I particularly like the music and sound effects in the Water section.One suggestion: keep the remote nearby at the end of the Water practice. You'll be in a mellow zone after the end of the meditation, and the music pops back on so quickly that it's kind of startling.Overall, my favorite Qi Gong DVD by far.
