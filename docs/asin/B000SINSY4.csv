1086240,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B000SINSY4,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[0, 0]","This TV series has an almost Shakespearean blend of tragedy and comedy that has the viewer on  a roller coaster of emotions in the small space of one two hour episode.  The viewer who is already familiar with the venue of Lochdubh and its residents will enjoy the entries in Series Three. More than the first, this (and series two) show the countryside beautifully.  Some of the views of the mountains and the lake are so impressive, I almost feel like going in search of Lochdubh even though I know it doesn't actually exist.For those who've seen the two previous entries this is a welcome return to a familiar venue.  As in good soap operas, the series characters have caught us up in the ongoing events of their lives, and we almost feel like they're personal friends.  We've lived through some of the ups and downs in some of their lives and have even parted with some of them.  Series Three presents a number of chances for us to see the village in action when their win of a lottery has unfortunate effects on their relationships, their pursuit of the Stone of Scone leads to unanticipated sacrifices, and their confrontation with some big city villains leaves the latter feeling out of their depths.  My favorite of the three, but so sad to see them go.",5,Sad to see the series end!,1280361600,"07 29, 2010",2010,1260,"['TV', 'series', 'almost', 'Shakespearean', 'blend', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'viewer', 'roller', 'coaster', 'emotions', 'small', 'space', 'one', 'two', 'hour', 'episode', 'viewer', 'who', 'already', 'familiar', 'venue', 'Lochdubh', 'residents', 'will', 'enjoy', 'entries', 'Series', 'Three', 'More', 'first', 'series', 'two', 'show', 'countryside', 'beautifully', 'views', 'mountains', 'lake', 'are', 'so', 'impressive', 'almost', 'feel', 'going', 'search', 'Lochdubh', 'even', 'know', ""n't"", 'actually', 'exist.For', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'two', 'previous', 'entries', 'welcome', 'return', 'familiar', 'venue', 'good', 'soap', 'operas', 'series', 'characters', 'have', 'caught', 'up', 'ongoing', 'events', 'lives', 'almost', 'feel', ""'re"", 'personal', 'friends', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'ups', 'downs', 'lives', 'have', 'even', 'parted', 'Series', 'Three', 'number', 'chances', 'see', 'village', 'action', 'when', 'win', 'lottery', 'unfortunate', 'effects', 'relationships', 'pursuit', 'Stone', 'Scone', 'unanticipated', 'sacrifices', 'confrontation', 'big', 'city', 'latter', 'feeling', 'depths', 'favorite', 'three', 'so', 'sad', 'see', 'go']",Hamish MacBeth - Series Three

1086242,A91BK8S5QH98K,B000SINSY4,CelticWomanFanPiano,"[1, 2]","This is the third of the three series featuring Hamish MacBeth, a BBC production featuring Robert Carlyle as the local Constable who tries to help the locals out more than perhaps he probably should.  But it ends up being an endearing aspect to his character.  This series had some clever episodes such as ""The Honorable Policeman"".  But the really disappointing aspect of the series is the really stretched out plot wise two part conclusion.  Hamish and Isobel end up in a snowy cave rescued by a rather unusual man who burns money and they finally get their differences ""sorted out.""  It would have been nicer after all the previous episodes in which Hamish said he wanted to do things the ""right"" way now, if he had proposed to Isobel in the cave, but the writers had minds of their own.  It boggles the mind in the series how they are in such a snowy peak and in the next scene it is bright and sunshiny.  Perhaps that is possible in the Highlands, I do not know, but the whole thing seems to lack some kind of logical explanation.  It is sad that TV John ends up dying in the series, although in an honorable way.  The plot featuring the hypnotist seems like the series' usual mix of the paranormal with mystery plot fare, which calls for a serious suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer.  All in all, I'm glad I checked this series out of my local library.  I've watched ""Ballykissangel"" and ""Monarch of the Glen"", so I'm become accustomed to the BBC shows, which can often be quite good.  I do have to say, though, that while this series has promise it just doesn't quite fulfill its promise.  The writing just isn't up to par with most of the episodes leaving many unresolved issues at the end.",1,"Some clever episodes, pathetic ending.",1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,1713,"['third', 'three', 'series', 'featuring', 'Hamish', 'MacBeth', 'BBC', 'production', 'featuring', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'local', 'Constable', 'who', 'help', 'locals', 'out', 'more', 'perhaps', 'probably', 'should', 'up', 'being', 'endearing', 'aspect', 'character', 'series', 'had', 'clever', 'episodes', 'such', 'Honorable', 'Policeman', 'really', 'disappointing', 'aspect', 'series', 'really', 'stretched', 'out', 'plot', 'wise', 'two', 'part', 'conclusion', 'Hamish', 'Isobel', 'end', 'up', 'snowy', 'cave', 'rescued', 'rather', 'unusual', 'man', 'who', 'money', 'finally', 'get', 'differences', 'sorted', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nicer', 'previous', 'episodes', 'Hamish', 'said', 'wanted', 'do', 'things', 'right', 'way', 'now', 'had', 'proposed', 'Isobel', 'cave', 'writers', 'had', 'minds', 'own', 'mind', 'series', 'how', 'are', 'such', 'snowy', 'peak', 'next', 'scene', 'bright', 'sunshiny', 'Perhaps', 'possible', 'Highlands', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'whole', 'thing', 'lack', 'kind', 'logical', 'explanation', 'sad', 'TV', 'John', 'up', 'dying', 'series', 'honorable', 'way', 'plot', 'featuring', 'hypnotist', 'series', 'usual', 'mix', 'paranormal', 'mystery', 'plot', 'fare', 'serious', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'part', 'viewer', ""'m"", 'glad', 'checked', 'series', 'local', 'library', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Ballykissangel', 'Monarch', 'Glen', ""'m"", 'become', 'accustomed', 'BBC', 'shows', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'quite', 'good', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'though', 'series', 'promise', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fulfill', 'promise', 'writing', 'just', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'most', 'episodes', 'leaving', 'many', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'end']",Hamish MacBeth - Series Three

This is the third in the series and the shows presented here have quite the serious tone to them compared the the first two seasons.  The highland humour is still present  as the undergirding for the shows but much of what is here is just good drama.  We get to see a side of Hamish, and the other characters, that weren't so obvious before.  The season does go out on a high, but slightly weird, note regarding two of the characters' relationship as well as a shocking premonition coming true.

When ""Alex"" completely departed from character by becoming hysterical, stealing the radio van, driving off into the night and dying/committing suicide, it was a weird and unnecessary departure from the folksy, whimsical, cozy-mystery tone the series previously exhibited. She should have stayed in character and gone back to London leaving Hamish and Isobel to live happily ever after. Clearly, this was a device to stretch the stories into a third series. The third series is just an unmitigated disaster with everyone out of character, unlikely, bizarre story lines, crude sexual humor and humor at the expense of an unlikely and unlikable character with artificial limbs. They must have changed writers for the third series. I honestly wish I had not watched it.
