1152400,A17SUSWN64RA8J,B001675YOI,Pramod,"[13, 13]","This is a great introduction to Alaska by Jeff Corwin. The photography is spellbinding and the graphics are well done too. The host can sound over enthusiastic at times, but Alaska does that to people. It comprehensively covers all aspects of Alaska, its sights and wildlife (Denali National Park and Preserve, The Kenai Peninsula, Bear Country, Southeast Alaska get separate episodes). The DVD is of very good quality, seen on a good LCD or Plasma, possibly upscaled. A Blu-ray, sadly unavailable, would have been stunning. I lament that subtitles are missing. That would have benefitted the hard of hearing. It ideal for armchair travelers and all those interested in this vast land. Alaska is still pristine and efforts like this are needed to drive home the importance of preserving its unique charms. A great buy.",5,A great series,1250726400,"08 20, 2009",2009,818,"['great', 'introduction', 'Alaska', 'Jeff', 'Corwin', 'photography', 'spellbinding', 'graphics', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'too', 'host', 'can', 'sound', 'enthusiastic', 'times', 'Alaska', 'people', 'comprehensively', 'aspects', 'Alaska', 'sights', 'wildlife', 'Denali', 'National', 'Park', 'Preserve', 'Kenai', 'Peninsula', 'Bear', 'Country', 'Southeast', 'Alaska', 'get', 'separate', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'quality', 'seen', 'good', 'LCD', 'Plasma', 'possibly', 'upscaled', 'Blu-ray', 'sadly', 'unavailable', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stunning', 'lament', 'subtitles', 'are', 'missing', 'would', 'have', 'benefitted', 'hard', 'hearing', 'ideal', 'armchair', 'travelers', 'interested', 'vast', 'land', 'Alaska', 'still', 'pristine', 'efforts', 'are', 'needed', 'drive', 'home', 'importance', 'preserving', 'unique', 'charms', 'great', 'buy']",Into Alaska with Jeff Corwin

The other locations make me want to go back again.  I was a little afraid that some of the wild animal scenes might get violent, but they didn't.  I didn't want to see little bear cubs killed.
