998283,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000G1R39E,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Stephen King proves once again that he's the master of bizarre, unpredictable and warped storytelling.  Desperation is pure horror with a TON of atmosphere.  Totally fantastic movie.  Never read the book but then again, I'm not much of a book reader.  If the book's better, I wouldn't know.Desperation is about an evil police officer entity that at first seems completely ordinary with a bossy and arrogant undertone just taking a cruise out in the desert with nothing better to do.  However pretty soon we see that he's deliberately making people guilty as an excuse to arrest them for a crime they didn't commit (such as having a bag of marijuana in their possession in a couple instances).  This concept *alone* sounds interesting, but of course, Stephen King takes it even deeper.  Throw in vicious dogs, spiders and cougars appearing in unusual moments and now you have a quality storyline worthy of the Stephen King name.So many peculiar things happen while this mysterious cop appears in the middle of the desert, but that's for your viewing pleasure and not for me to spoil.  What's worth mentioning next however, is that once 5 or 6 people are arrested, one of the prisoners (a young boy who's really mature for his age and is a FANTASTIC actor if I do say so) believes that the power of prayer and the strong belief in God and freewill wins out in the end so with the guidance of this brave little boy, eventually it's up to these people to escape and put an end to the dangerous entity that's reeking havoc on this little town.What's causing this evil presence to appear, you wonder?  Due to a discovery among Chinese immigrants in a mineshaft several years ago, this Nevada town is again being tortured and it's up to the escaped prisoners to put an end to it.  Now a few things are probably copied from a couple other Stephen King movies.  For example, ""a group of people taking on unexplainable evil"" occurs in the Langoliers, and a malicious entity threatening to do harm to others occurs in the Storm of the Century (with the evil presence being incredibly sarcastic to the point of being comical) however there's enough original and compelling elements in Desperation that these comparisons aren't a big deal.  My only complaint is the way the ending occurs.  It's too bland and cheesy.

It starts off w/ a wonderfully insane performance by Ron Perlman (Hellboy himself!) as the homicidal sheriff / demon of the small town of the title. He's very fun to watch! Then, we see the gathering of the forces of good (Steve Weber, Annabeth Gish, Charles Durning, et al) who must face down this beast. There is solid evidence that we are in for an epic battle, a reworking of THE STAND in microcosm. Tension builds, weird things happen, and lives are lost. All is well until we get to the conclusion of the story. That's when the proverbial wheels fly off. I mean, there's all this build-up, all this ""coming supernatural showdown"" stuff for the first 90 minutes or so, then- Pfffftt! A big fizzle at the end.

I say ""a bit"" because ""Desperation"" is not one of Stephen King's better novels in the first place; Steven Spielberg would've been hard-pressed to make a good movie out of it, much less Mick Garris, who is decidedly no Steven Spielberg.Speaking of mick, can't we all get together and keep him from making Stephen King movies?  He's still not managed to make one that is as good as it ought to be: ""The Stand"" is good, but also incredibly bad in spots; ""The Shining"" not only fails to match Kubrick, it fails to replicate the novel; ""Ride the Bullet"" is like a student film; ""Sleepwalkers"" is incredibly uneven.Garris is terrible with actors (they always sound like they're actors delivering dialogue, rather than characters speaking to one another), yet somehow manages to attract good ones -- maybe that's King's rep at work.  Here, we get performances from Tom Skeritt, Ron Perlman, and Steven Weber that just don't take flight, despite being very on-the-mark in terms of technique.Garris also has, apparently, no visual sense; but even that isn't consistent, as he does sometimes manage to pull a very effective shot from out of nowhere.  I almost feel bad for railing against the guy, as he does show sings of promise; perhaps somewhere down the road.But stop mucking about with King!  He's suffered enough tepid adaptations; you're not helping!I expect to get slammed with negative feedback by King fans, but hey guys . . . I'm one of you, too.  And it ain't all gold.Speaking of King, his screenplay is adequate, but that's all.  It admirably reduces a lengthy novel to a feature-film length, but as the only interesting elements of said novel were the characters, and characterizations are the things that are the most trimmed in this abrdigement of the story . . . well, it all just seems like a waste to me.Ultimately, this one generates no strong feelings of any kind, and that's a problem in and of itself.Buy it if you're a King junkie.

It makes us human.I understand this.Now, what I can't understand is how you can take a very good premise ( I mean that ape guy in Alien Res as a crazy cop- the best man!the freaking best!Tak!)and culminate it into a dissapointing and frankly annoying ending.This movie could have been a masterpiece.It took Stephen kings character based saga and ran with it.The use of desert creatures as soldiers in the army of evil was a smart move, and even the redemption on the part of Tom skerrit rang somewhat true. The child actor was annoying as most are and the lead was quite good as he usually is- check out the TV Shining movie.I guess in the end what did this effort in was essentially the end.As in other reviews on Amazon, I have shown my displeasure of not exposing the titular creature. I mean, here we go through the whole movie, hearing about this TAK fella and do we even catch a glimpse of this demi-god or demon or whatever..no.This is my main complaint..the excellent beginning...the creature kills..the not made for TV dead bodies everywhere..all should have led up to the final confrontation with this antithesis of good. But what do we get instead, some kind of Rodney Dangerfield..I get no respect type dialogue between the good guy and the bad guy..with the good guy muttering to a hole in the ground that is supposed to represent the beast.Give me a break.Since when do the movie going public deserve fodder as a climax to a otherwise smooth and charming film.Why..oh why can't we all just agree on a common theme.If your gonna cop out at the end..just don't make the movie.So in conclusion, if you were to watch the movie halfway through and be interrupted and unable to complete its viewing you would say"" Wow.

No? Let me clarify, then.We're driving, Me & Thee, across some barren stretch of ancient Arizona moonscape, and we've hit upon what I call the Magic Hour: when the Day is laying down its sword in honor of Old Man Night, and the setting sun is really firing up all those sleeping reds and oranges and deep, feral yellows, up on the rocks, the hills, the cliffs, the crags, the bluffs.Can you see it? Can you hear the coyotes keening and wailing and hi-yi-kee-yi-ing away back up in some box canyon, where those black-rooted stunty trees wave their straggly, evil, twisted arms towards an absentee Heaven?We still think of America as a young country, and maybe that's just our innocence talking. Because this land is just as ancient as any trod by the African or Chinese, and can't you just smell the Terrible Old Blood-Secrets buried down under the Earth when you're out on the high desert?Sure. As the town of Desperation's former Sheriff (former, in that he's going through something of a---ah, Midlife Crisis) would say, Gosh, yes.The guts and sheer, pulpy, bloody visceral glory of Stephen King's novel ""Desperation"" rides that seam of ancient, buried, hulking horror like a 40-something housewife saddling up the mechanical bull at Gilley's, and that's half its charm---which is why I was expecting so much with Mick Garris's cinematic version, and, no doubt, why I was just so damned disappointed.The setup, the build, the execution---everything about ""Desperation"" cuts thematically close to the territory King marked with his bad-doggie tale ""Cujo"". Remember ""Cujo""? Something ancient and unspeakably evil, and deeply stupid and hungry---something nasty lies all coiled-up in a dark cave.Until Cujo---big, bumbling, naive, benevolent---comes lumbering into its domain.And gets eaten. Devoured. Turned into a shambling, rabid hulk of its former lovable slobbery self, transformed into a ravenous engine of death with one single design: to spread carnage, red and raw and toothy, across the trembling land.Now, just as the arc and trajectory of the bullet isn't all that mindful of its casing, so too the unsleeping Ancient Evils of Cujo and Desperation aren't too picky about their corporeal hosts. Whether it's a 300-pound dog or a 300-pound lawman, the only real concern is where to pile the bodies.Or so you'd think. Sadly, ""Desperation"" is a tiny little bang, and a ton of whimper: 15 minutes of shivery brilliance, and what feels like about 8 hours of unbridled dullness.That bristling tale of ancient, sleeping, hungry Evil---Tak ripped out of his slumber with the explosion of the charges in the Rattlesnake Pit, and his unquenchable desire to eat his way out into the guts of the little town of Desperation---all of the novel's frantic hardscrabble fight against a mounting, relentless Evil is wasted by Mick Garris's listless, uninspired direction.It's as if Garris burned up his budget hiring Ron Perlman to run the numbers as Collie Entragian, and then outsourced the rest of the flick to Bangalore. Hell, they even dragoon some worn-out mountain lion to take a chunk out of flabby old Charles Durning's patooshka, and even that doesn't jack up the Excite-O-Meter on this miserable thing.Not that I'm complaining about Perlman: this sad little flick bumps and grinds and gets its Crawling Kingsnake groove-on *only* when Entragian is on the screen, and Perlman is the perfect choice as the Lawman who goes all Economy on us and squeezes both Good Cop *and* Bad Cop into one body, then goes on to Downsize his jurisdiction. With extreme prejudice. Tak!""Desperation"" has its 15 minutes of brilliance with that fatal traffic stop: everything is just about note perfect. Those lying, impossibly high wild-blue Western skies; the Trooper lurching out of his cruiser, that Gary Cooper drawl just crackling out over the silence of the High Desert, the spike of Dread at the curt command to step out of the car succeeded by a queasy flood of relief when---thank God!---it's just a busted-tail-light.It's here, in the seconds before ""Desperation"" lurches forward zombie-style into B-grade horror, that the movie succeeds, that it creeps and crawls the way the book did. It is here that the film conjures up the loneliness of the Vast Stretches, the realization---something most American suburbanites go to their graves without knowing---that there are wild spaces on this crazy planet where you could be murdered and buried without anyone knowing how, or why.While the coyotes howl, the scorpions scuttle and clatter, the black widows stalk and spin and move

When I heard the film was available on DVD and ""R"" rated, too, I vowed to rent it and see the movie as it was designed to be seen. Curses, gore, adult scares and, perhaps a booby! One wouldn't expect anything but the most watered down presentation on ABC but the ""R"" rated version, oh boy!The DVD, rated ""R"", was EXACTLY the same presentation word for word and scene for scene with the only difference being the exclusion of commercials. I'm going to say, and prove me wrong, that the ""R"" rating was slapped on the DVD to intice people to rent it to see the original adult version. What a sneaky rip-off. How can they do that?Overall, the movie was not great. The ending was completely tacked on and I got a little tired of the sermonizing.

This time the action takes place entirely in the southwestern desert, with a bunch of people trying to escape a scenery-chewing Ron Perlman... when they aren't having theological discussions that kills whatever plot momentum has been built up.Mary Jackson (Annabeth Gish) and her husband are driving in Nevada when they are stopped by Sheriff Etragian (Perlman). He comes up with an excuse to arrest them, and soon reveals that he's also a dangerous psychopath who plans to kill them. He also apprehends a famous writer, Johnny Marinville (Tom Skerritt), who happens to be passing through the area.After killing Mary's husband, Etragian throws them in the jail cells, along with an old veterinarian (Tom Billingsley) and the Carver family, including the highly religious boy David (Shane Haboucha). David believes that God will take care of them, despite his hysterical mother's scorn.Meanwhile, Marinville's ""roadie"" Steve (Steven Weber) and a hitchhiker named Cynthia (Kelly Overton) sneak into Desperation to find out what's happening, and discover that everyone has been killed. The group soon realizes that Etragian is possessed by a grotesque, demonic entity referred to as ""Tak,"" which plans to use their bodies once the current one wears out.""Stephen King's Desperation"" has a pretty simple story: an evil demon has been released from its prison, and a band of anti-heroes must stop it. The chills are in the execution -- the movie is caked in blood, dust, insects and the smell of rotting corpses, and the constant presence of silent, murderous animals gives everything an eerie feeling. Desperation is literally a ghost town.Director Mick Garris goes for a pulpy, over-the-top style, with lots of close-ups of Tak and eerie scenes involving child ghosts and mind-controlled beasts. It can be a little disorienting when Perlman's enormous head fills the screen at an angle -- it looks like he's about to pop out and bite you. But he also has a knack for tapping into the raw, primal horror in King's work, such as Tak's bombastic, bipolar way of talking.The problem? Well, this movie has a LOT of theological musings. It feels like we can barely get through a scene without the narrative grinding to a halt so the characters can argue about the timeless topic of why God lets bad things happen. No, we don't get any deep answers.As for the actors, Perlman chews the scenery like he's been starving in the desert, and his performance is kind of fun. Haboucha is rather stiff and a little irritating (does he HAVE to mention God in every sentence?), but Weber, Skerritt, Gish and an unusually normal Matt Frewer all give excellent performances -- most of their characters aren't really developed (except for alcoholism), but they make their characters likable.""Stephen King's Desperation"" keeps tripping over its own theological musings, but otherwise is an effective, simple horror movie -- and it's worth it for Perlman's constantly over-the-top acting.",3,Talk a lot!,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,3233,"['deserts', 'Nevada', 'old', 'collapsed', 'mine', 'been', 'reopened', 'something', 'old', 'vile', 'surfaced', 'first', 'time', 'century.That', 'plot', 'description', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Desperation', 'one', 'few', 'King', 'stories', 'Maine', 'time', 'action', 'place', 'entirely', 'southwestern', 'desert', 'bunch', 'people', 'trying', 'escape', 'scenery-chewing', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'having', 'theological', 'discussions', 'plot', 'momentum', 'been', 'built', 'up.Mary', 'Jackson', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'husband', 'are', 'driving', 'Nevada', 'when', 'are', 'stopped', 'Sheriff', 'Etragian', 'Perlman', 'up', 'excuse', 'arrest', 'soon', 'reveals', 'also', 'dangerous', 'psychopath', 'who', 'kill', 'also', 'famous', 'writer', 'Johnny', 'Marinville', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'who', 'be', 'passing', 'area.After', 'killing', 'Mary', 'husband', 'Etragian', 'jail', 'cells', 'old', 'veterinarian', 'Tom', 'Billingsley', 'Carver', 'family', 'including', 'highly', 'religious', 'boy', 'David', 'Shane', 'Haboucha', 'David', 'God', 'will', 'take', 'care', 'hysterical', 'mother', 'scorn.Meanwhile', 'Marinville', 'roadie', 'Steve', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'hitchhiker', 'named', 'Cynthia', 'Kelly', 'Overton', 'sneak', 'Desperation', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'discover', 'everyone', 'been', 'killed', 'group', 'soon', 'Etragian', 'possessed', 'grotesque', 'demonic', 'entity', 'referred', 'Tak', 'use', 'bodies', 'current', 'one', 'out', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Desperation', 'pretty', 'simple', 'story', 'evil', 'demon', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'band', 'anti-heroes', 'must', 'stop', 'chills', 'are', 'execution', 'movie', 'caked', 'blood', 'dust', 'insects', 'smell', 'rotting', 'corpses', 'constant', 'presence', 'silent', 'murderous', 'animals', 'everything', 'eerie', 'feeling', 'Desperation', 'literally', 'ghost', 'town.Director', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'pulpy', 'over-the-top', 'style', 'lots', 'close-ups', 'Tak', 'eerie', 'scenes', 'involving', 'child', 'ghosts', 'mind-controlled', 'beasts', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'disorienting', 'when', 'Perlman', 'enormous', 'head', 'screen', 'angle', 'pop', 'out', 'bite', 'also', 'knack', 'tapping', 'raw', 'primal', 'horror', 'King', 'work', 'such', 'Tak', 'bombastic', 'bipolar', 'way', 'talking.The', 'problem', 'Well', 'movie', 'LOT', 'theological', 'musings', 'can', 'barely', 'get', 'scene', 'narrative', 'grinding', 'halt', 'characters', 'can', 'argue', 'timeless', 'topic', 'why', 'God', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'deep', 'answers.As', 'actors', 'Perlman', 'scenery', 'been', 'starving', 'desert', 'performance', 'kind', 'fun', 'Haboucha', 'rather', 'stiff', 'little', 'irritating', 'HAVE', 'mention', 'God', 'sentence', 'Weber', 'Skerritt', 'Gish', 'unusually', 'normal', 'Matt', 'Frewer', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'most', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'developed', 'alcoholism', 'make', 'characters', 'likable', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Desperation', 'tripping', 'own', 'theological', 'musings', 'otherwise', 'effective', 'simple', 'horror', 'movie', 'Perlman', 'constantly', 'over-the-top', 'acting']",Desperation

I mean on the lonesome road from nowhere to somewhere in the middle of the land that God forgot, we can place the wooden, and absolutely untalented Henry Thomas (E.T.) in a vehicle, with a conversation that was so unmotivating, I thought, ""wait, wait, this has to be a Stephen King based movie."" The two carry on this horrible relationship through the first twenty minutes of the movie, and you are praying to your own personal God that either one of them gets mauled to stop the insanity. Ron Pearlman plays this overacted, possessed cop, and during his interactions with the unknowing travelers, his face becomes more grim, as the possession slowly eats away at the cocoon. (see friends, this entity takes control of the host body, and slowly, evidentally eats away at it, therefore each new body finds more feed, that being the unknowing travelers.)I thought perhaps the superb Tom Skerritt (Picket Fences, Contact, A River Runs Through It) [to name my favorites] could help the overacting and pathetic dialog, while holding on to some semblance while an ensemble forms in the local town of Desperation's police station. It doesn't. It tries to, but what movie doesn't try overtly to become cohesive. The grounding is formulaic, and it's petty. Ok, so let's go back to that acting made the movie comment by doctor death there. Amazing? To whom, Helen Keller? Shane Haboucha, playing the young boy David in the film, who suffers tremendous loss, did a really good job, as he UNDOUBTEDLY carried the entire film, however his acting was pushed, rushed and so scripted, there was no emotional creativity in the least. (His crying scenes were as paltry as Culkin trying to be something other than Kevin McCallister)Desperation is what you scream out during the last scenes of the movie, because the name is fitting considering how rancid the cutting is. I wont give anything away, but the ending in itself is enough to make most film lovers drop their jaws in horror at exactly why the director would allow such complete absurdity in a film, and a voiceover that you thought would be from a man behind the curtain who you aren't supposed to pay atttention to.

998298,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B000G1R39E,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[0, 0]","STEPHEN KING'SDESPERATION""Desperation is one of my favorite King novels out there, in fact I remember the day I bought it. It was in 1996 when I was living in Laredo Texas, I got it with his other novel under the name Richard Bachman, ""The Regulators"". I had to get both because they were mirror books, some of the same characters and things in parallel universes. Any way I had waited for years to see this book on film. So finally a few years back I got it, and what I got was a pretty good TV flick.A young couple is driving threw the Nevada desert when they are pulled over by a local sheriff. Things heat up as the officer plants drugs on them and arrests them. When taken into the town it seems like no one actually lives there, it is a ghost town. They reach the jail only to be locked up with other unlucky travelers who the sheriff grabbed. They have no idea what is going on but something is really messed up with this sheriff. It may or may not have something to do with the town's history and the mine that was once the life blood of the place. Something that may not be human at all.This King adaptation which was written by King himself is of course nowhere near as good as the book, but it is good. Mick Garris comes back to direct this movie as he has made many a King flick. In fact he was the director of the epic ""The Stand"" that many people including myself love. I like that he tried to keep the feeling of the book intact but it doesn't match entirely. Still the idea of good versus evil is obviously still intact which has always been a big thing in most King novels. In fact this one has much to do with God and the evil that would be against him. In that respect it is much like ""The Stand"" and the spiritual quest that those us who believe must take to over come said evil.I will say that I love the way this film was shot, there are times when it makes the story feel so much bigger. Then of course there are times when it gets tight and that adds to the feeling of dread that the group has to deal with. Also the effects are very good for a TV flick which this is, it was not a miniseries. The look of the sheriff as he wears down is very well done as are any bloody moments. Speaking of him Ron Pearlman is great here as the lead villain. You can tell he had a really great time with this role and at times ham'd it up.Also Garris regulars Matt Frewer and Steven Weber are excellent as well. Frewer who has been in many a Garris project since his turn as ""The Trashcan Man"" in the stand may have been the MVP here. His performance is really good and one of the best he has done in one of Mick's flicks. Weber who starred in King's and Garris's ""The Shining"" TV miniseries once again does a good job. The rest of the cast is also just as great here with Tom Skerritt in particular as a writer that the cop picks up was memorable to me. Still everyone here was great including the kid whose character is very much an intricate part of this story.Now this is not a perfect movie and is not even one of the best of the King movies. But for his TV ones this is pretty good. Like I said before I love the look and feel of this movie but despite all that it doesn't feel as big as the book. Now I know that what I said is no shock to anyone, but I had been waiting on this movie for years. So I know I built up expectations a little too high which is not fair to the film. Also I think it should be noted that the reason the effects are so good are because KNB were the people behind them. I didn't know this until I watched the movie with the great audio commentary by Director Mick Garris, actor Ron Pearlman, and Executive Producer Mark Sennet. Also there is a behind the scenes feature called ""Letters from Bangor"".I would have loved to have seen this the way King and Garris originally wanted, as a feature film. I think this movie would have been closer to an actual classic, same cast and everything would have been wonderful. Also for anyone who has read the two books or the ""Dark Tower"" series should be happy that they are still ""Tak-ing"" around here.

To show it in flipping pictures has a lot less effect. The pangs of conscience and intellect of the main opponent, the one who is going to destroy Tack, or rather to bury him or it alive in the underground mine is less convincing on the screen. Yet the film is strange, just as much as the book was, because Stephen King inverts some essential elements of his vision. For him, over and over again, evil is on the surface and causes damage underground, in the doppelganger world that is supposed to support us and yet is obliged to bear the great destructions we impose onto it. Here evil exists underground and has to be buried alive back into that underground from which human greed has managed to get it out in the most brutal way: mining and exploiting Chinese who are transformed into some un-respected cattle. This simplicity of the relation between the surface and the underground world is surprising for Stephen King who has often accustomed us to more complex relations, like in the Dark Tower. That makes the film slightly superficial and standing only on the frightening leg. We would have liked to be terrorized in our minds more than out superficial nervous system. Apart from that it is well built and directed though the emphasis on God, of course the good old Christian God, is definitely excessive and it should have been widened up to a universal God, ,especially in the present period where some are willing to start religious wars against anyone who is of a different creed or faith.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",4,Too Biblical to be fascinating,1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,1784,"['book', 'was', 'interesting', 'especially', 'descriptions', 'decaying', 'nature', 'Tack', 'embodied', 'sheriff', 'other', 'being', 'afterwards', 'show', 'flipping', 'pictures', 'lot', 'less', 'effect', 'pangs', 'conscience', 'intellect', 'main', 'opponent', 'one', 'who', 'going', 'destroy', 'Tack', 'rather', 'bury', 'alive', 'underground', 'mine', 'less', 'convincing', 'screen', 'film', 'strange', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'book', 'was', 'Stephen', 'King', 'essential', 'elements', 'vision', 'over', 'again', 'evil', 'surface', 'damage', 'underground', 'doppelganger', 'world', 'supposed', 'support', 'yet', 'obliged', 'bear', 'great', 'destructions', 'impose', 'Here', 'evil', 'underground', 'be', 'buried', 'alive', 'back', 'underground', 'human', 'greed', 'managed', 'get', 'out', 'most', 'brutal', 'way', 'mining', 'exploiting', 'Chinese', 'who', 'are', 'transformed', 'un-respected', 'cattle', 'simplicity', 'relation', 'surface', 'underground', 'world', 'surprising', 'Stephen', 'King', 'who', 'often', 'accustomed', 'more', 'complex', 'relations', 'Dark', 'Tower', 'film', 'slightly', 'superficial', 'standing', 'only', 'frightening', 'leg', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'be', 'terrorized', 'minds', 'more', 'superficial', 'nervous', 'system', 'Apart', 'well', 'built', 'directed', 'emphasis', 'God', 'course', 'good', 'old', 'Christian', 'God', 'definitely', 'excessive', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'widened', 'up', 'universal', 'God', 'especially', 'present', 'period', 'where', 'are', 'willing', 'start', 'religious', 'wars', 'anyone', 'who', 'different', 'creed', 'faith.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",Desperation

Demon spirits of Chinese workers are released after a mining explosion and nasty Sheriff has wiped out the entire population.

998320,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000G1R39E,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[4, 5]","One night when my friends were over late, we discovered that one of them had locked himself out of his car.  To be more precise, the key had snapped off in the lock.  It was an old car.While we were trying to jimmy the lock, a car sped by - it was common for drivers in front of my parents' house to roar down the street with total disregard to speed limits - and a police cruiser drove past soon after.  We cheered; finally, a cop was going to pull someone over for speeding!Instead, the cruiser turned around.  The cop and his partner, wary of four teenagers trying to break into a car, went on the offensive. One of my friends, the son of a cop, dared to frown as the cop tried to intimidate him, which just made things worse.  As my friend put it, police have ""SERVE and protect"" on their cars.  But there was a lot less serving going on.  When we explained that we weren't trying to break into the car, the cops told us to try harder and drove off.  They could just have easily arrested us.I was in the comfort of home turf, in front of my parents' house, surrounded by friends.  But what if it were just me alone, out in unfamiliar territory, and the cop accused me of something I didn't do?  What then? That's the premise behind Desperation.At least, that's how it starts.  Like so many Stephen King stories, Desperation takes a nugget of everyday terror and explodes it into a full-blown story of terrifying proportions.  We discover the fate of two lonesome travelers, Peter (Henry Thomas) and Mary (Annabeth Gish) Jackson, as they are pulled over by sheriff Collie Entragian (the fantastic Ron Perlman) of Desperation, Nevada.  A sasquatch of a man, Desperation lets the question hang in the air for a few minutes as to whether Entragian is merely corrupt or truly insane. Once it's clear that he's completely bonkers and afflicted with some kind of debilitating condition, the tension peaks - is Entragian the victim of a disease? Did he really kill off all the inhabitants of Desperation?  Or is he just a corrupt cop looking for a bribe?Unfortunately, Desperation answers.  And answers.  And won't shut up about it - it's a battle between good and evil, between God and the Devil, between city folk and town folk, between man and nature, between White men and Chinese.  In other words, it's every Stephen King movie you've ever seen.Entragian, the scariest part of the entire movie, disappears to be replaced with a body-hopping spirit. Marching in to fill his place is a cavalcade of King stereotypes: the drunk, the desperate couple, the psychic child. The new addition is a stand in for King himself, John Edward Marinville (Tom Skerritt), who mocks his books and the genre he helped establish with a wink and a nod.King throws a stream of exotic words at us to cover up the pedestrian plot torn from H.P. Lovecraft's The Temple: a series of stone idols (Can Tah, or ivory statues in The Temple) are unearthed from an underground dimension (Pirin Moh, a parallel for Atlantis) that release a demon from the depths (a ""wazeen"" known as TAK, a parallel to Gloon from The Temple).  By the time the King stand-in has a showdown with TAK, it's clear from the dialogue that the author has given up on trying to scare us and is just laughing all the way to the bank.Amidst talk about God's plans, ghostly appearances, wild animal attacks, and creepy statues, what started as a battle of wills between people in a desert town turns into a full-blown holy war. Or at least, a war of words.  More breath is spent arguing over the existence of God than meaningfully propelling the plot.  King apparently wanted to write about his religious view of the universe and decided to do it through Desperation.  It's about as exciting as it sounds.",2,TAK-y,1282435200,"08 22, 2010",2010,3745,"['One', 'night', 'when', 'friends', 'were', 'over', 'late', 'discovered', 'one', 'had', 'locked', 'car', 'be', 'more', 'precise', 'key', 'had', 'snapped', 'off', 'lock', 'was', 'old', 'car.While', 'were', 'trying', 'jimmy', 'lock', 'car', 'sped', 'was', 'common', 'drivers', 'front', 'parents', 'house', 'roar', 'down', 'street', 'total', 'disregard', 'speed', 'limits', 'police', 'cruiser', 'drove', 'past', 'soon', 'cheered', 'finally', 'cop', 'was', 'going', 'pull', 'someone', 'speeding', 'Instead', 'cruiser', 'turned', 'around', 'cop', 'partner', 'wary', 'four', 'teenagers', 'trying', 'break', 'car', 'went', 'offensive', 'One', 'friends', 'son', 'cop', 'dared', 'frown', 'cop', 'tried', 'intimidate', 'just', 'made', 'things', 'worse', 'friend', 'put', 'police', 'have', 'SERVE', 'protect', 'cars', 'was', 'lot', 'less', 'serving', 'going', 'When', 'explained', 'were', ""n't"", 'trying', 'break', 'car', 'cops', 'told', 'try', 'harder', 'drove', 'off', 'could', 'just', 'have', 'easily', 'arrested', 'us.I', 'was', 'comfort', 'home', 'turf', 'front', 'parents', 'house', 'surrounded', 'friends', 'what', 'were', 'just', 'alone', 'out', 'unfamiliar', 'territory', 'cop', 'accused', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'What', 'then', 'premise', 'Desperation.At', 'least', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'Stephen', 'King', 'stories', 'Desperation', 'nugget', 'everyday', 'terror', 'full-blown', 'story', 'terrifying', 'proportions', 'discover', 'fate', 'two', 'lonesome', 'travelers', 'Peter', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'Mary', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'Jackson', 'are', 'pulled', 'over', 'sheriff', 'Collie', 'Entragian', 'fantastic', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'Desperation', 'Nevada', 'A', 'sasquatch', 'man', 'Desperation', 'question', 'hang', 'air', 'few', 'minutes', 'Entragian', 'merely', 'corrupt', 'truly', 'insane', 'clear', 'completely', 'bonkers', 'afflicted', 'kind', 'debilitating', 'condition', 'tension', 'peaks', 'Entragian', 'victim', 'disease', 'Did', 'really', 'kill', 'off', 'inhabitants', 'Desperation', 'just', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'looking', 'bribe', 'Unfortunately', 'Desperation', 'answers', 'answers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'shut', 'up', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'God', 'Devil', 'city', 'folk', 'town', 'folk', 'man', 'nature', 'White', 'men', 'Chinese', 'other', 'words', 'Stephen', 'King', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Entragian', 'scariest', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'be', 'replaced', 'body-hopping', 'spirit', 'Marching', 'fill', 'place', 'cavalcade', 'King', 'stereotypes', 'drunk', 'desperate', 'couple', 'psychic', 'child', 'new', 'addition', 'stand', 'King', 'John', 'Edward', 'Marinville', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'who', 'books', 'genre', 'helped', 'establish', 'wink', 'nod.King', 'stream', 'exotic', 'words', 'cover', 'up', 'pedestrian', 'plot', 'torn', 'H.P', 'Lovecraft', 'Temple', 'series', 'stone', 'idols', 'Can', 'Tah', 'ivory', 'statues', 'Temple', 'are', 'unearthed', 'underground', 'dimension', 'Pirin', 'Moh', 'parallel', 'Atlantis', 'release', 'demon', 'depths', 'wazeen', 'known', 'TAK', 'parallel', 'Gloon', 'Temple', 'time', 'King', 'stand-in', 'showdown', 'TAK', 'clear', 'dialogue', 'author', 'given', 'up', 'trying', 'scare', 'just', 'laughing', 'way', 'bank.Amidst', 'talk', 'God', 'plans', 'ghostly', 'appearances', 'wild', 'animal', 'attacks', 'creepy', 'statues', 'what', 'started', 'battle', 'wills', 'people', 'desert', 'town', 'full-blown', 'holy', 'war', 'least', 'war', 'words', 'More', 'breath', 'spent', 'arguing', 'existence', 'God', 'meaningfully', 'propelling', 'plot', 'King', 'apparently', 'wanted', 'write', 'religious', 'view', 'universe', 'decided', 'do', 'Desperation', 'as', 'exciting']",Desperation

998327,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000G1R39E,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Desperation (Mick Garris, 2006)Ron Perlman is an actor who isn't afraid to take chances, and in general, the more risks he takes, the better the resulting character. Consider his work in such classics as Cronos and City of Lost Children, for example. On the other hand, here you've got an adaptation of a Stephen King novel; it's pretty much a guaranteed shot out of the park, but there's not a great deal of room for Perlman to play with character, given that King is a master of characterization. Still, it's Ron Perlman; you've got a 90% chance of a fantastic performance. (The other 10% was Blade II.)Perlman plays Collie Entragian, the sheriff of the town of Desperation, NV, where something very odd is going on. Collie is rounding up people just passing through and tossing them into jail; there's a renegade writer (Tom Skerritt) and his assistant (Steven Weber, who's done some King TV adaptations in the past, including The Shining miniseries and an episode of Nightmares and Dreamscapes); a family; a hitchhiker. And there's something wrong with Collie, though we can't really tell what, at first. He's got some odd twitches, and he's sunburned, but you kind of expect that from a guy who polices out in the middle of nowhere. It becomes obvious, though, that there's a lot more going on with him. And the town itself looks pretty darned deserted, as folks are rolling through it in the back of the police car. The prisoners have to figure out what's going on, and quick.I tend to slot Stephen King novels into three categories. There are the brilliant novels where there's not a thing wrong with the finished product ('Salem's Lot, The Stand, Misery, etc.), the mediocre novels I can take or leave (The Regulators, Bag of Bones, Needful Things, etc.), and the flat-out awful ones I'll never consider reading again (The Tommyknockers, Insomnia, etc.). Desperation is one of the mediocre ones, and I kind of avoided watching this for a couple of years because the mediocre novels, when they're adapted, tend toward mediocre movies. But, man, Ron Perlman. I'm not sure how much of a stretch this really was for him; it's certainly not as amazing a character as he played in City of Lost Children. But he brings something to the role nonetheless, and it's Perlman who's really going to hook the viewer here. The supporting cast isn't exactly full of slouches, either; Weber and Skeritt are joined by Charles Durning, Annabeth Gish, the woefully underrated Matt Frewer, Kelly Overton, Henry Thomas, and many more, all of whom bring, if not their A games, at least the top level of their B games. Garris, in his sixth partnership with King, keeps the pace fast and hard, though he does sacrifice some of the novel's character development in the process, and because of that the film is not all it could be. But then it's a TV movie, and so there were time constraints one wouldn't find in a feature film; still, it clocks in at over two hours, and to keep a movie this fast-paced for this long requires a good deal of artistry.Very good work indeed; probably my favorite TV adaptation of King since Tobe Hooper adapted 'Salem's Lot over thirty years before. Not great, but well worth watching. *** ",3,"Could have been much worse, but could have been better.",1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,3204,"['Desperation', 'Mick', 'Garris', '2006', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'actor', 'who', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'take', 'chances', 'general', 'more', 'risks', 'better', 'resulting', 'character', 'Consider', 'work', 'such', 'classics', 'Cronos', 'City', 'Lost', 'Children', 'example', 'other', 'hand', 'here', ""'ve"", 'got', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'pretty', 'much', 'guaranteed', 'shot', 'park', 'not', 'great', 'deal', 'room', 'Perlman', 'play', 'character', 'given', 'King', 'master', 'characterization', 'Still', 'Ron', 'Perlman', ""'ve"", 'got', '90', '%', 'chance', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'other', '10', '%', 'was', 'Blade', 'II', 'Perlman', 'Collie', 'Entragian', 'sheriff', 'town', 'Desperation', 'NV', 'where', 'something', 'very', 'odd', 'going', 'Collie', 'rounding', 'up', 'people', 'just', 'passing', 'tossing', 'jail', 'renegade', 'writer', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'assistant', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'who', 'done', 'King', 'TV', 'adaptations', 'past', 'including', 'Shining', 'miniseries', 'episode', 'Nightmares', 'Dreamscapes', 'family', 'hitchhiker', 'something', 'wrong', 'Collie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'what', 'first', 'got', 'odd', 'twitches', 'sunburned', 'kind', 'expect', 'guy', 'who', 'out', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'obvious', 'though', 'lot', 'more', 'going', 'town', 'pretty', 'darned', 'deserted', 'folks', 'are', 'rolling', 'back', 'police', 'car', 'prisoners', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'quick.I', 'tend', 'slot', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novels', 'three', 'categories', 'are', 'brilliant', 'novels', 'where', 'not', 'thing', 'wrong', 'finished', 'product', 'Lot', 'Stand', 'Misery', 'etc', 'mediocre', 'novels', 'can', 'take', 'leave', 'Regulators', 'Bag', 'Bones', 'Needful', 'Things', 'etc', 'flat-out', 'awful', 'ones', ""'ll"", 'never', 'consider', 'reading', 'again', 'Tommyknockers', 'Insomnia', 'etc.', 'Desperation', 'one', 'mediocre', 'ones', 'kind', 'avoided', 'watching', 'couple', 'years', 'mediocre', 'novels', 'when', ""'re"", 'adapted', 'tend', 'mediocre', 'movies', 'man', 'Ron', 'Perlman', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'stretch', 'really', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'amazing', 'character', 'played', 'City', 'Lost', 'Children', 'something', 'role', 'nonetheless', 'Perlman', 'who', 'really', 'going', 'hook', 'viewer', 'here', 'supporting', 'cast', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'full', 'slouches', 'either', 'Weber', 'Skeritt', 'are', 'joined', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'woefully', 'underrated', 'Matt', 'Frewer', 'Kelly', 'Overton', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'many', 'more', 'whom', 'bring', 'not', 'A', 'games', 'least', 'top', 'level', 'B', 'games', 'Garris', 'sixth', 'partnership', 'King', 'pace', 'fast', 'hard', 'sacrifice', 'novel', 'character', 'development', 'process', 'film', 'not', 'could', 'be', 'then', 'TV', 'movie', 'so', 'were', 'time', 'constraints', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'find', 'feature', 'film', 'still', 'two', 'hours', 'keep', 'movie', 'fast-paced', 'long', 'good', 'deal', 'artistry.Very', 'good', 'work', 'indeed', 'probably', 'favorite', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'King', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'adapted', ""'Salem"", 'Lot', 'thirty', 'years', 'before', 'Not', 'great', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', '***']",Desperation

Even for religious people, you may find it annoying - it feels to preachy to me.

As a film, is so-so, as a faithful adaptation it's quite impressive.  I've never been much of a Garris fan, but he usually tries to make the most faithful King adaptation he can for tv.  Plus it helps that he enlists King himself to write the script.  The movie is damn near 90% accurate with the book(people whining about the lack of an actual Tak monster at the climax should consult the book and realize you never really saw it in there either.  The exchange through the eye-like hole in the ground was accurate).  A few corners were cut here and there, but you can't complain too much about minor changes since it's King himself doing the changes.  As a film, it's not terribly impressive.  Like the rest of the made-for-t.v. King films, it looks and feels like a made-for-t.v. film.  This eliminates any kind of creepiness the film would have.  I don't know what it is about made for t.v. movies, but you can spot one instantly, they seem to have a look about them.  A great decision was casting Perlman as the cop.  He had the look and talk down wonderfully.  Many of us who read the book most likely pictured a guy like Perlman while reading it.  The character is supposed to be a bit younger, but that's no big deal and has no real bearing on the story.  The rest of the cast is kinda throwaway.  Frewer is given nothing to do but whine like a little girl, Durning's so-so, and the kid is annoying, like most psychic/godlike kids are in horror films.  Skerritt's good though.  I'm kinda biased on that one coz I've always liked him.  I like Weber as well, but he just kinda peters out when the whole gang unites.  Though it's an average film, I do gotta give it kudos for being one of the few King adaptations that makes an honest attempt to keep it faithful.  It really is a painless two hours.

For the first hour, Desperation was great and Ron Pearlman was hilarious as the twisted sheriff, abducting people on the highway. Unfortunately, about half way through this film, the movie changes focus to young David, played by the kid from the Stacy's Mom video, Shane Haboucha. David is some kind of prophet who is more aware of things than the other. That was cool, but his constant ramblings about God, and spouting of all this religious bull got really annoying. By the time things built up to the end, I was so annoyed with this little kid and his ramblings that I just didn't care about what was going to happen. I just wanted the film to be over. Desperation is just another case of a writer and an actor taking things too far, to a point where it taints the whole movie.",2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,913,"['When', 'Stephen', 'King', 'work', 'started', 'being', 'turned', 'movies', 'were', 'always', 'great', 'newer', 'stuff', 'really', 'been', 'hit', 'miss', 'first', 'hour', 'Desperation', 'was', 'great', 'Ron', 'Pearlman', 'was', 'hilarious', 'twisted', 'sheriff', 'abducting', 'people', 'highway', 'Unfortunately', 'way', 'film', 'movie', 'changes', 'focus', 'young', 'David', 'played', 'kid', 'Stacy', 'Mom', 'video', 'Shane', 'Haboucha', 'David', 'kind', 'prophet', 'who', 'more', 'aware', 'things', 'other', 'was', 'cool', 'constant', 'ramblings', 'God', 'spouting', 'religious', 'bull', 'got', 'really', 'annoying', 'time', 'things', 'built', 'up', 'end', 'was', 'so', 'annoyed', 'little', 'kid', 'ramblings', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'just', 'wanted', 'film', 'be', 'Desperation', 'just', 'case', 'writer', 'actor', 'taking', 'things', 'too', 'far', 'point', 'where', 'whole', 'movie']",Desperation

In the case of a product, one can argue that some reviewers got a a bad item because the factory workers had a bad day or the product was damaged during shipment. In the case of a movie, however, we all get the same product. That being said, there is absolutely no reason this movie should receive anything above 2 stars. The acting in this movie is pretty bad. The plot is definitely in the 2 star range, if I were generous. The movie looks and feels old and dated. Ron Perlman who (fair disclosure) I've never really been a fan of. Hams it up as a crazy sheriff. There are a few good actors in the movie, like Charles Durning and Tom Skerrit, but they don't have any material to really work with. I'm not sure about the level of Stephen Kings involvement with the movie, but his movies are generally better when he isn't too involved. This is definitely a B or C horror flick. It was really painful to watch. I still haven't finished, but I will dutifully try and finish it tonight. I say this with a greater sense of dread than the movie is able to stir up in its audience. Maybe the true genius of the movie is the discomfort and dread it inspires in watching, not because the movie is that good, but rather because it's so bad.One last thing: Can I say that I really have a problem when people give 5 star ratings to movies like this? I mean, have they ever seen The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, The Shining, etc.? How many stars would they get? Is this truly on a par with those movies? Are they saying, ""Hey, thsi is a horror classic? I just wish I had more stars to give. Utterly wonderful. I would see it again and again. When does the blue ray come out? I want to own this and pass it on to my posterity? Great job, movie people!"". Now I realize that movies vary and you can't always compare one with another, but really? If you ignore my review and the other 1 star reviews on this movie, I challenge you to sit through the entire thing and watch it again. I dare you!
