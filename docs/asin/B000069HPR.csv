At first, I found myself just enjoying the recreation, on screen, of a very  idyllic time (1920)  and place (small country town) with the seemingly gentle and harmless character of Major Herbert Armstrong played superbly by Michael Kitchen  along with his most irritating wife wonderfully (and surprisingly for me) played by Sarah Miles.  The next thing I was aware of, I was completely absorbed in this murder/mystery.""Dandelion Dead"" is NOT a ""who done it?""  From the very beginning, I was fully aware that the Major had poisoned his harpy of a wife.  (in all honesty, to me, if anyone ""had it coming"" it was she-what a B....!) The ""mystery/suspense"" is how is the major going to get caught with justice prevailing.  At first, it DOES appear that he has gotten away with murder.

Whereas Foyle has rock hard integrity, the Major, not as much. But he is more amiable. The Major is saddled with a disagreeable wife. No, that is too kind. She is absolutely horrid, played marvelously by Sarah Miles. She has not a shred of affection for him, is an unremitting nag & embarasses him in front of friends & associates. I found myself rooting for him as he decides to poison her with arsenic he has acquired to rid himself of weeds in his beloved garden. She dies a slow, painful death. He is free! But so is his hubris at getting away with murder so easily. His law practice is slipping & he has competition in the small village where he works. So...Lovely period piece set in 1921.

The first part really reels the viewer in with the gorgeous scenery, charming atmosphere, lovely costumes, and English gents saying ""Jolly good"" and ""Cheerio"". What fun! However, the plot is quite a bit darker which is why the film is so good. Set against this beautiful backdrop, the charming Herbert Armstrong decides to murder his wife. And, even though I am always one to side with the victims rather than the perpetrator, this is one time I would say the wife had it coming.Oh, she was horrible! And, he was just wonderful. She was rude, unloving, and seemed to only have her self-interest at heart. When he'd make overtures to her to talk about their issues she'd rebuff him in the nastiest way possible. He wasn't milquetoast, though-- he seemed to have quite a bit of depth under that placid demeanor. She actually had the nerve to interrupt him at a tennis tournament to tell him to get home for dinner and that it was his bath night!(This movie is based on true events and, from what I've read on other sites (look up Major Herbert Armstrong), the depictions of these characters were very true to life.)Consequently, we empathize with Armstrong and don't mind when she drinks her arsenic-laced tea and cocoa. It's exciting to see Armstrong come out of his shell and be actually happy (while she's ill) because we've grown to care about HIM and understand how horrible the wife made his life and the children's lives.In the second part, though, we change our minds completely about Herbert. He's no longer just a charming happy guy freed from living with an evil shrew-- he's now selfish and unscrupulous. Realizing what an easy time he had killing his wife, he now considers murder as an option for dealing with his business rival.Had he not attempted this other crime, he would have gotten away with his wife's murder.I don't usually like true crime films. This falls into the genre, I guess, but it's really a wonderful drama. Michael Kitchen (Foyle's War, To Play the King) is very versatile-- much more than I realized. Everyone in this was just excellent, as was the script and direction.By the end, the viewer really does want Armstrong to get his comeuppance, but the entire chain of events is so very sad. There are no happy endings for anyone.The disc has few extras-- bios of the main cast and a little silly quiz.ADDENDUM: I recently read The Hay Poisoner by Martin Beales. Beales believes Armstrong is innocent and presents evidence to attempt to prove his case. If you really liked this movie and are interested in this case, you might want to read that book, as well. It was also published under the title Dead Not Buried.  But, both titles are the exact same book.",4,Riveting True Crime Drama,1204675200,"03 5, 2008",2008,2837,"['Spoiler', 'alert', 'two', 'part', 'movie', 'watched', 'first', 'part', 'yesterday', 'second', 'part', 'evening', 'was', 'riveting', 'start', 'finish', 'first', 'part', 'really', 'viewer', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'charming', 'atmosphere', 'lovely', 'costumes', 'English', 'gents', 'saying', 'Jolly', 'good', 'Cheerio', 'What', 'fun', 'However', 'plot', 'quite', 'bit', 'darker', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'Set', 'beautiful', 'backdrop', 'charming', 'Herbert', 'Armstrong', 'murder', 'wife', 'even', 'am', 'always', 'one', 'side', 'victims', 'rather', 'perpetrator', 'one', 'time', 'would', 'say', 'wife', 'had', 'coming.Oh', 'was', 'horrible', 'was', 'just', 'wonderful', 'was', 'rude', 'unloving', 'seemed', 'only', 'have', 'self-interest', 'heart', 'When', ""'d"", 'make', 'overtures', 'talk', 'issues', ""'d"", 'rebuff', 'nastiest', 'way', 'possible', 'was', ""n't"", 'milquetoast', 'though', 'seemed', 'have', 'quite', 'bit', 'depth', 'placid', 'demeanor', 'actually', 'had', 'nerve', 'interrupt', 'tennis', 'tournament', 'tell', 'get', 'home', 'dinner', 'was', 'bath', 'night', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'sites', 'look', 'up', 'Major', 'Herbert', 'Armstrong', 'depictions', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'true', 'life', 'Consequently', 'empathize', 'Armstrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'when', 'arsenic-laced', 'tea', 'cocoa', 'exciting', 'see', 'Armstrong', 'come', 'shell', 'be', 'actually', 'happy', 'ill', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'care', 'HIM', 'understand', 'how', 'horrible', 'wife', 'made', 'life', 'children', 'lives.In', 'second', 'part', 'though', 'change', 'minds', 'completely', 'Herbert', 'longer', 'just', 'charming', 'happy', 'guy', 'freed', 'living', 'evil', 'shrew', 'now', 'selfish', 'unscrupulous', 'Realizing', 'what', 'easy', 'time', 'had', 'killing', 'wife', 'now', 'murder', 'option', 'dealing', 'business', 'rival.Had', 'not', 'attempted', 'other', 'crime', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'wife', 'murder.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'true', 'crime', 'films', 'genre', 'guess', 'really', 'wonderful', 'drama', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'Foyle', 'War', 'Play', 'King', 'very', 'versatile', 'much', 'more', 'realized', 'Everyone', 'was', 'just', 'excellent', 'was', 'script', 'direction.By', 'end', 'viewer', 'really', 'want', 'Armstrong', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'entire', 'chain', 'events', 'so', 'very', 'sad', 'are', 'happy', 'endings', 'anyone.The', 'disc', 'few', 'extras', 'bios', 'main', 'cast', 'little', 'silly', 'quiz.ADDENDUM', 'recently', 'read', 'Hay', 'Poisoner', 'Martin', 'Beales', 'Beales', 'Armstrong', 'innocent', 'presents', 'evidence', 'attempt', 'prove', 'case', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'are', 'interested', 'case', 'might', 'want', 'read', 'book', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'also', 'published', 'title', 'Dead', 'Not', 'Buried', 'titles', 'are', 'exact', 'same', 'book']",N/A

707079,AUFK6UT2DU87H,B000069HPR,"Meredith L. Burton ""Bookworm""","[3, 3]","Dramas based on true stories are often more strange than fiction.  ""Dandelion Dead"" is an unforgettable miniseries that chronicles the life of Major Herbert Armstrong, a British solicitor living in the early part of the 20th century.  Major Armstrong was convicted of the murder of his wife Catherine in 1921.This miniseries is enthralling from the very beginning.  Superb characterization is employed to make true people shine in their foibles and good points.  Armstrong is shown as a downtrodden husband whom you can easily empathize with.  However, as the story progresses, he becomes more erratic and unpredictable.  Therefore, the viewer is glad when he receives his just desserts.The acting in this movie is marvelous! Michael Kitchen is unsurpassable is Armstrong, bringing a vulnerability to this complex person.  As he prepares the arsenic-laced cocoa and tea for his wife, the viewer is repelled, but he/she is also secretly proud of the henpecked man for standing up for his rights.  Of course, when one says this, it sheds light on his/her secret dark desires.  Sarah Miles does brilliant work as the repulsive Catherine, and shee, too, gives emotional depth to an otherwise irredeemable character.  Toward the end of the first part of the miniseries, you see this character begin to change, so you tend to have mixed emotions about her fate.  The other performers are equally brilliant.I strongly recommend this brilliant movie.

It is not just a murder-mystery but a study of jealousy and small-town crises and scandals.
