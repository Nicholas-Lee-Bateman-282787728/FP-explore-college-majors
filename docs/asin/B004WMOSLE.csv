That really would come down to personal preference.Series three of Wish ME Luck builds on the same surviving characters we came to know and be drawn into through series one and two as it brings us to the end of the war.It has all the elements that made series one and two so captivating, for me at least. Love, betrayal, loyalty, courage, determination and force of character were all displayed by the actors in a very finely tuned and most professional way - a way that had the ice-cream forgotten and melting in the bowl!All aspects of this series about the Women's spy service were excellently executed - the costumes were very detailed, the sets profesional, even the aircraft didn't look like cheaply done computer animations or enhancements.Between the characters, the storylines, both of which were excellently developed, and the sets the viewer is almost irresistably drawn into and through the period with every advancing episode.The only advice I could possibly give to anyone, and its from a personal perspective, if you like drama, and set around this period, buy the entire set. You probably will eventually anyway.

British women in the Special Operations Executive (SOE) branch of the war fought in silence, often leading men, risking all on the French theater. Subplots in these 8 episodes also finding occasional love. Duty for the women gets ugly and hard. Triumphs with tragedy. Takes place in 1944 in SE France, with bits in London HQ. Women in strong roles (based on REAL stories), and tense episodes that provide a magnificent view of idyllic French countryside. Excellent attention to period detail. 8 episodes with a continuing story, picked up from the previous season. So good my wife and I watched all, one after another.""WISH ME LUCK: Series 1 & 2"" might be considered as well. One introduces characters that continue throughout the 3 years by involvement in some dicey espionage. More military/spy action/fighting in 2nd. Historically accurate war drama. Fantastic 1940s depiction of London and France. It's a segment of real war action that is seldom featured.Cast: now head of HQ-Faith (Jane Asher-Death at a Funeral).....Spy Kit (Michael J.

1430746,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B004WMOSLE,Jon Wynne,"[0, 1]","Series One of WISH ME LUCK left me wanting more. Series Two left me on the edge of my seat. I could hardly wait for the third and final series!The contribution of female British agents in World War II is a time-honoured, though still under-represented, topic in films. Beginning with such films as &#8220;Odette&#8221; and &#8220;Carve Her Name With Pride&#8221; (both made in the &#8217;50s), the British have taken occasional stabs at presenting the stories of these courageous women whose contribution to the war effort is often over-looked. WISH ME LUCK is a gripping program that seeks to give credit where credit is due.Series Three picks up where Series Two left off, though there is one notable absence, at least on the home front. Julian Glover for some reason left the show and while Jane Asher is promoted to the central home front role, she isn&#8217;t as commanding a presence as Glover. This really serves as a metaphor for the whole series by this point: something is missing and you wish they&#8217;d recover it, or just get on with things!Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s still a gripping espionage thriller, but by now we&#8217;ve seen everything we&#8217;re going to see from these characters, even though there are some changes in the central cast. In harm&#8217;s way previously, Kate Buffery was a wonderful protagonist. While it is entirely believable that her character would disappear for a while, she was sorely missed. She did appear for the finale, which was a good thing, and helped to give the series a proper finish.I thoroughly enjoyed Series Three of WISH ME LUCK, though the storylines had become awfully familiar by now.Still, it&#8217;s nice when a quality program has the opportunity to wrap up loose ends and finish things properly.

For those so interested the SOE really existed and was created in 1940 by Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Minister of Economic Warfare Hugh Dalton to conduct guerrilla warfare against the Axis and to instruct and aid local resistance movements. The last series of this TV show was in some ways the weakes of the three but in other ways one of the strongest. First off, some of new characters were just below par in acting abilities. The Jewish girl courier overacted, trying to talk in an overly sophisticated voice and bulging her eyes and sticking her chin out too much. It just looked weird and a spy would try to fit in, not stand out. She was easily the most noticeable and irriating and while there were some others they were several notches down. In other areas it was strong because it used characters from the previous two series and it also built up the ending to a tragic conclusion.The third and final series is based on the actions of the Maquis du Vercors and the events in Vassieux-en-Vercors, though the locations used are given fictional names, such as the village being named Couermont and the plateau ""Le Crest"".  Nice touch on showing the home people getting too attached to their agents when bad things happen at the end.
