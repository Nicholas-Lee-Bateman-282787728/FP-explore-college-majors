Yes, the story was a tad on the bland side but the excellent acting by Freddie Highmore made up for it.  The story is about a conflicted and philosophical high school student (Highmore) who is failing in his studies. He believes that life is too short and inconsequential and that getting an education isn't worth it.  He befriends a girl from his school and they form a close and unique bond.  The movie explores their unusual relationship and the highs and lows that transpire.  I found the ""Art of Getting By"" to be touching and entertaining.

If you give this movie a chance, it will draw you in. If you enjoy indie films, than this is a no-brainer.

Yeah, now that unplaceable American accent now makes some sense.Yet too much of this was way too odd. Apparently in New York City no one cards high school students in bars or nightclubs. The musical choices on the soundtrack are interesting but, honestly, a bit twee and second division indie. I thought (SPOILER ALERT) Emma Roberts putting the moves on the painter ""friend"" in his 20s was a pretty dumb plot twist. Also, the cramming in of an entire year of homework assignments into three weeks was ridiculously unachievable. Plus the final project painting just did not fit Highmore's art up to that point. He goes from funky out-there fantasy style manga meets graphic novel to a straight very traditional portrait?The performances worked, New York City as a ""character"" worked, but the plot was too inevitable.

1497212,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B005PTMPYA,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[1, 1]","The Art of Getting By is a wonderful coming of age film. Freddie Highmore and Emma Roberts turn in wonderful performances and carry this film.George is bored at his expensive New York City prep school. He sees Sally across the rooftop of the school smoking. When a teacher steps out onto the roof, he takes the blame for smoking. He's so used to be being in trouble, what's one more problem? At a very simple level, the film is about Sally and George being friends, and maybe being more than friends - which will it be?This is a wonderful small independent film that focuses on emotions and the two lead characters. The writer and director, Gavin Wiesen, develops the romantic tension between Sally and George without being heavy handed. This is Wiesen's first feature length film. Freddie Highmore (August Rush, The Golden Compass, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) turns in another great performance. I believed that he was that artistic, smart, and that bored. But yet he always seemed to do the right thing, even though he could have done the wrong thing. Emma Roberts (Lymelife, Nancy Drew, Hotel for Dogs, and Scream 4) was radiant as the quirky, bohemian girl that confuses and attracts George. The rest of the cast was quite good; they truly supported these two main characters.The film is not perfect. Somehow these two seventeen or eighteen year old kids end up with beers in front of them and in bars in New York City a little more often than they should be. Maybe this is classic well to do children in prep school in New York City - it certainly wouldn't play that way elsewhere. The teachers weren't necessarily represented in a positive light. George was a little bit too friendly with the principal. The three week ultimatum was a bit odd. These were minor flaws for me, I hung much more on what George or Sally would say. I cared more about those two characters and could overlook the flaws.This is a short film at an hour and twenty three minutes. Wiesen did an excellent job with pacing; the film did not drag at the usual middle point. I loved the color of this film. For a first time feature length film, this was an impressive film.The film is rated PG-13. There is underage drinking in the film for those sensitive parents. The f bomb gets tossed once and other strong language is used (all television appropriate language). George and Sally discuss sex. What makes it appropriate is the reaction they have to the discussion. There is a very brief scene where George is seen lying in bed with a tent pole under the covers (it is brief, embarrassing for him, but very natural and appropriate in the film). I'm very happy this film didn't get bumped to an R rating, it is a really fine coming of age film that thirteen year plus viewers should see.This was a wonderful small independent film that was a surprise. Freddie Highmore and Emma Roberts are worth the price of admission.Freddie Highmore:August RushThe Golden CompassCharlie and the Chocolate FactoryEmma Roberts:LymelifeNancy DrewHotel for DogsScream 4",5,Enjoyable Coming Of Age DVD,1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,3038,"['Art', 'Getting', 'wonderful', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'turn', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'carry', 'film.George', 'bored', 'expensive', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'prep', 'school', 'Sally', 'rooftop', 'school', 'smoking', 'When', 'teacher', 'out', 'roof', 'blame', 'smoking', 'so', 'used', 'be', 'being', 'trouble', 'what', 'one', 'more', 'problem', 'very', 'simple', 'level', 'film', 'Sally', 'George', 'being', 'friends', 'maybe', 'being', 'more', 'friends', 'will', 'be', 'wonderful', 'small', 'independent', 'film', 'emotions', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'writer', 'director', 'Gavin', 'Wiesen', 'romantic', 'tension', 'Sally', 'George', 'being', 'heavy', 'handed', 'Wiesen', 'first', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'August', 'Rush', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'great', 'performance', 'believed', 'was', 'artistic', 'smart', 'bored', 'yet', 'always', 'seemed', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'even', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'wrong', 'thing', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'Lymelife', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Hotel', 'Dogs', 'Scream', '4', 'was', 'radiant', 'quirky', 'bohemian', 'girl', 'George', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'truly', 'supported', 'two', 'main', 'characters.The', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'Somehow', 'two', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'year', 'old', 'kids', 'end', 'up', 'beers', 'front', 'bars', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'little', 'more', 'often', 'should', 'be', 'Maybe', 'classic', 'well', 'do', 'children', 'prep', 'school', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'play', 'way', 'elsewhere', 'teachers', 'were', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'represented', 'positive', 'light', 'George', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'friendly', 'principal', 'three', 'week', 'ultimatum', 'was', 'bit', 'odd', 'were', 'minor', 'flaws', 'hung', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'George', 'Sally', 'would', 'say', 'cared', 'more', 'two', 'characters', 'could', 'overlook', 'flaws.This', 'short', 'film', 'hour', 'twenty', 'three', 'minutes', 'Wiesen', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'pacing', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'drag', 'usual', 'middle', 'point', 'loved', 'color', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'was', 'impressive', 'film.The', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'underage', 'drinking', 'film', 'sensitive', 'parents', 'f', 'bomb', 'tossed', 'once', 'other', 'strong', 'language', 'used', 'television', 'appropriate', 'language', 'George', 'Sally', 'discuss', 'sex', 'What', 'appropriate', 'reaction', 'have', 'discussion', 'very', 'brief', 'scene', 'where', 'George', 'seen', 'lying', 'bed', 'tent', 'pole', 'covers', 'brief', 'embarrassing', 'very', 'natural', 'appropriate', 'film', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'bumped', 'R', 'rating', 'really', 'fine', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'thirteen', 'year', 'viewers', 'should', 'see.This', 'was', 'wonderful', 'small', 'independent', 'film', 'was', 'surprise', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'are', 'price', 'admission.Freddie', 'Highmore', 'August', 'RushThe', 'Golden', 'CompassCharlie', 'Chocolate', 'FactoryEmma', 'Roberts', 'LymelifeNancy', 'DrewHotel', 'DogsScream', '4']",N/A

Gavin Wiesen both wrote and directed this updated existentialist story and cast it with a very solid crew of actors.  The result is a movie that is both nostalgic and heartwarming.George Zinavoy (Freddie Highmore as a very fine developing adult actor) is a lonely and fatalistic high school senior who believes `you are born alone, die alone and everything else is an illusion'. Despite the fact that he is very intelligent and artistic he fails to complete any class work assignments, failing to see the point of doing such mundane tasks if we are all going to simply die anyway. His mother (Rita Wilson) and father (Sam Robards) are at odds: his father's business went bankrupt and he spends his time in the park and in coffee shops to hide the fact that he is unemployed (George sees this unbeknownst to the parents). George finally makes a friend in Sally (Emma Roberts), and develops and attraction for clueless George. The school's principal (Blair Underwood) and art teacher (Jarlath Conroy) introduce him to an alumni, and successful artist, Dustin (Michael Angarano - continuing to be one of the most interesting young actors on the screen today), who can help guide George along life's path, but other distractions start surfacing, and George might not even be able to graduate from high school.  How George discovers his feelings and his options is a well played out ending.There are some fine cameos by Alicia Silverstone, Ann Harada, Marcus Carl Franklin, Ann Dowd, Elizabeth Reaser among others.  But the significant satisfaction is the privilege of watching Freddie Highmore graduate into more adult roles: he is becoming a very fine actor.

He is used to being the problem and figured he would take the fall instead of her.Some of the reviews talk about how ""scattered"", ""mopey"" ""dreadful"" or ""self centered"" this movie is, but I will tell you none of that!Freddie and Emma are wonderful actors who took a dreary, slow, somber script about coming of age as teens about to embark on a new path in life and gave it life!Freddie Highmore who we have all come to love in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Arthur and the Invisibles, August Rush, Finding Neverland is right up there with Dakota Fanning as far as acting chops. I cannot wait to see how far he does. He has grown into a tall child (5'10) and has border Zac Efron looks.Emma Roberts is Kristen Stewart without the awkwardness and quiet mannerisms.Freddie's George is a deep, thoughtful, smart boy who has way too much going on in his artistic head. The weight of his family life and his unsure movement into manhood creates a tornado of emotions that he doesn't have the tools to deal with. The secondary characters, especially in his school Blair Underwood, Alicia Silverstone, Jarloth Conroy are wonderful. My favorite moments of the movie were with his teachers and principles.I was sobbing in his last scene with Jarloth Conroy!Freddie is AMAZING so forget about all the other reviews and see this for what it is...a stepping stone of an amazing actor moving from children's movies into adult movies.",4,Coming of Age Movie,1322697600,"12 1, 2011",2011,1692,"['411', 'Freddie', 'George', 'senior', 'high', 'school', 'lot', 'mind', 'deep', 'thoughtful', 'artistic', 'probably', 'something', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'real', 'Freddie', 'Emma', 'popular', 'senior', 'who', 'Freddie', 'blame', 'something', 'used', 'being', 'problem', 'figured', 'would', 'take', 'fall', 'instead', 'her.Some', 'reviews', 'talk', 'how', 'scattered', 'mopey', 'dreadful', 'self', 'centered', 'movie', 'will', 'tell', 'none', 'Freddie', 'Emma', 'are', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'who', 'took', 'dreary', 'slow', 'somber', 'script', 'coming', 'age', 'teens', 'embark', 'new', 'path', 'life', 'gave', 'life', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'love', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Arthur', 'Invisibles', 'August', 'Rush', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'right', 'there', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'chops', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'grown', 'tall', 'child', ""5'10"", 'border', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'looks.Emma', 'Roberts', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'awkwardness', 'quiet', 'mannerisms.Freddie', 'George', 'deep', 'thoughtful', 'smart', 'boy', 'who', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'artistic', 'head', 'weight', 'family', 'life', 'unsure', 'movement', 'manhood', 'tornado', 'emotions', ""n't"", 'have', 'tools', 'deal', 'secondary', 'characters', 'especially', 'school', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'Jarloth', 'Conroy', 'are', 'wonderful', 'favorite', 'moments', 'movie', 'were', 'teachers', 'principles.I', 'was', 'sobbing', 'last', 'scene', 'Jarloth', 'Conroy', 'Freddie', 'AMAZING', 'so', 'forget', 'other', 'reviews', 'see', 'what', 'stepping', 'stone', 'amazing', 'actor', 'moving', 'children', 'movies', 'adult', 'movies']",N/A

But maybe I'm missing something.  I had high expectations because I do think the two lead actors have tremendous talent and potential, and did a great job.  However, the introduction to the characters seemed a bit inconsistently handled.  At times there were efforts to develop the characters and then things seemed to happen with and between the characters that didn't have a solid footing, requiring a bit of a leap of faith in sticking with the story.

1497226,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B005PTMPYA,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","Remember little Freddie Highmore from 2004's ""Finding Neverland""?  Well now he's a tall, lanky 20 year old playing a well-to-do high school senior at a private school in New York City.  He is struggling with his studies and is at risk of not graduating.  Smart enough, but he's lost interest in school and spends most of his time creating interesting sketches.He meets a cute fellow classmate, Sally Howe (Emma Roberts) who has her own issues.  She's the daughter of Charlotte (Elizabeth Reaser), herself only 36 and still full of vigor when it comes to men and the flash of Manhattan.  Unfortunately there's not much new here.  We have a couple of attractive 18 year olds, struggling with what they will do with their lives.  It's hard to be terribly sympathetic with kids on the ""right side of the track"" not even worried about going to school.In one scene, George (Highmore) who is still a virgin, is questioned by Sally (who isn't) about it.  He struggles with an honest answer, so she suggests they get it on.  This freaks George out, so for the next 20 minutes we try to figure out what George's real problem is.  I kind of lost interest at that point.  Still first time director and writer, Gavin Wiesen actually does a pretty good job with the direction if not the boring script.  Highmore and Roberts hold their own with the lightweight material.  Michael Angarano is along for the ride as a former student who has made a name for himself as a painter.  He becomes a mentor for George and a lover of the shunned Sally.  I had to look twice but yes that's Alicia Silverstone as one of George's teachers.The Blu ray transfer is OK but nothing special.  Shot in 35mm film, it has an appropriate soft appearance.  It has a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 which is clear and centered for the most part.

He meets Sally (Roberts) who sees the same thing in herself. This is a very good movie made better by the acting. Highmore, in a departure from his usual disgustingly good boy roles is excellent in this. Roberts, who is fast becoming a better actress then her aunt is, is also fantastic in this movie. The role of George is written to be a total jerk to most people he meets, but Highmore has enough ""baggage"" with him that even though he is not nice to almost everyone in the movie you still wind up rooting for him and wanting him to succeed by the end. That is a rare thing for an actor that young. While this is a very good movie that forces you to keep watching it does tend to drag in a few places, but not enough to be boring. If that makes sense.
