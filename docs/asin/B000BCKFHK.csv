Yes, even by the standards of slasher films.Firstly, the central characters are investigating the disappearence of other characters. When one of them vanishes, the others are focused on their disappearence. Understandable, but these people rarely talk about anything else. There's some talk on their army training and that's about it. They have very little personnality.Secondly, the Skeleton Man himself uses weapons such as a sword, lance, bow, etc. Generally speaking, don't slasher movie fans want to see inventive deaths?Also, at some time  the Skeleton Man has some kind of connection or relevence to birds of prey but it's not really explained. It's also reasonably long for a slasher movie, but there's a lot more deaths than I've seen in any other slasher movie, so I guess the movie being longer doesn't change much.Aside from being sub-par in the most important elements of a slasher movie, this movie isn't all that bad . I enjoyed it (and not in a ""so bad its good"" way, because I never have that mentality while watching movies), but it's not something I'd recommend to slasher movie fans in general.",2,"Very simple movie, even by slasher standards",1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,1163,"['couple', 'things', 'lacking', 'substance', 'Yes', 'even', 'standards', 'slasher', 'films.Firstly', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'investigating', 'disappearence', 'other', 'characters', 'When', 'one', 'vanishes', 'others', 'are', 'focused', 'disappearence', 'Understandable', 'people', 'rarely', 'talk', 'anything', 'else', 'talk', 'army', 'training', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'personnality.Secondly', 'Skeleton', 'Man', 'weapons', 'such', 'sword', 'lance', 'bow', 'etc', 'Generally', 'speaking', 'do', ""n't"", 'slasher', 'movie', 'fans', 'want', 'see', 'inventive', 'deaths', 'Also', 'time', 'Skeleton', 'Man', 'kind', 'connection', 'relevence', 'birds', 'prey', 'not', 'really', 'explained', 'also', 'reasonably', 'long', 'slasher', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'deaths', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'slasher', 'movie', 'guess', 'movie', 'being', 'longer', ""n't"", 'change', 'much.Aside', 'being', 'sub-par', 'most', 'important', 'elements', 'slasher', 'movie', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'way', 'never', 'have', 'mentality', 'watching', 'movies', 'not', 'something', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'slasher', 'movie', 'fans', 'general']",N/A

I thought STAR SHIP TROOPERS rather ho-hum except for the great special effects. When I saw Casper's name I thought of that movie and I bought SKELETON MAN with the ""how bad can it be?"" mindset.I hadn't realized it had been made for the SciFi Channel although that wouldn't have had any effect on the decision to buy except to expect a bit less in the special effects department.We can now change the ""a bit less"" to darn near nonexistant. Someone told the writer/director to keep panning the scenery as a) it'll make the movie it's required length and b) it'll give the audience a sort of feel for the situation. Without the constant panning the movie is about a half hour long. The situation is boring. The is acting minimal, the script inane, and the special (snicker) effects are considerably less than awesome. The continuity mistakes are bothersome, the idiot mistakes are constant, and the things the script has the folks doing are silly. The entire movie makes me think of a couple of high school kids getting together to make a slasher movie. In fact, that feeling persists throughout the entire flick.Is it just me or has anyone else noticed that when we have a group of people the women are all wearing a whole lot less than the men?  The men in this one are wearing two or three shirts. The women are ALL wearing tanktops. I'm amazed, truly, that they aren't also wearing shorts (camoflaged, of course). And where the heck did all the guns come from? On that note, where the heck did all the Skeleton Man's weapons come from? Did he keep a stable of horses cuz they did seem to change a bit here and there. And why didn't the woman try to drive the SUV she found instead of running into a small building. GETTING AWAY FROM THERE would seem to be the bright thing to do. Well, silly me, the bright thing to do would have be NOT to appear in this movie and/or once it was made NOT to waste my money on it.Give this one a big pass.",1,Obviously Sponge Bob has become an agent to the semi-stars,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,2108,"['Obviously', 'Sponge', 'Bob', 'become', 'agent', 'semi-star', 'otherwise', 'WHY', 'earth', 'would', 'people', 'especially', 'Casper', 'van', 'Dien', 'even', 'appear', 'disaster', 'thought', 'STAR', 'SHIP', 'TROOPERS', 'rather', 'ho-hum', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'When', 'saw', 'Casper', 'name', 'thought', 'movie', 'bought', 'SKELETON', 'MAN', 'how', 'bad', 'can', 'be', 'mindset.I', 'had', ""n't"", 'realized', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'SciFi', 'Channel', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'effect', 'decision', 'buy', 'expect', 'bit', 'less', 'special', 'effects', 'department.We', 'can', 'now', 'change', 'bit', 'less', 'darn', 'nonexistant', 'Someone', 'told', 'writer/director', 'keep', 'panning', 'scenery', ""'ll"", 'make', 'movie', 'required', 'length', 'b', ""'ll"", 'give', 'audience', 'sort', 'feel', 'situation', 'constant', 'panning', 'movie', 'half', 'hour', 'long', 'situation', 'boring', 'acting', 'minimal', 'script', 'inane', 'special', 'snicker', 'effects', 'are', 'considerably', 'less', 'awesome', 'continuity', 'mistakes', 'are', 'bothersome', 'idiot', 'mistakes', 'are', 'constant', 'things', 'script', 'folks', 'doing', 'are', 'silly', 'entire', 'movie', 'think', 'couple', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'getting', 'together', 'make', 'slasher', 'movie', 'fact', 'feeling', 'persists', 'entire', 'flick.Is', 'just', 'anyone', 'else', 'noticed', 'when', 'have', 'group', 'people', 'women', 'are', 'wearing', 'whole', 'lot', 'less', 'men', 'men', 'one', 'are', 'wearing', 'two', 'three', 'shirts', 'women', 'are', 'ALL', 'wearing', 'tanktops', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'truly', 'are', ""n't"", 'also', 'wearing', 'shorts', 'camoflaged', 'course', 'where', 'heck', 'did', 'guns', 'come', 'note', 'where', 'heck', 'did', 'Skeleton', 'Man', 'weapons', 'come', 'Did', 'keep', 'stable', 'horses', 'cuz', 'did', 'seem', 'change', 'bit', 'here', 'there', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'woman', 'try', 'drive', 'SUV', 'found', 'instead', 'running', 'small', 'building', 'GETTING', 'AWAY', 'FROM', 'THERE', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'bright', 'thing', 'do', 'Well', 'silly', 'bright', 'thing', 'do', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'NOT', 'appear', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'NOT', 'waste', 'money', 'it.Give', 'one', 'big', 'pass']",N/A

940470,A2FQDF8QE9B9BC,B000BCKFHK,"H. Detter ""Finally""","[5, 5]","Having watched every movie in my collection worth watching at least 3 or 4 times, I decided to buy a new movie. Being a huge fan of horrors, that's always the section I start my new movie search. As I rounded the corner of my huge electronics super store (you know the name) and approached the ""S"" section, my eyes were drawn to ""Skeleton Man"". Everything about its packaging (excellent cover photo, 2 actors who I respect, description on the back) made me believe it would be of at least decent quality. The extremely low purchase price convinced me to make the purchase. Would I land a diamond in the rough?To paraphrase Malcolm X, ""I've been hoodwinked, bamboozled, lead astray, run amuck"". This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. EVER. I'm very forgiving of bad movies but this truly is unacceptable. By reading the other reviews here on Amazon, I learned that this was a Sci-Fi Channel sponsored movie. Fine. Made for TV movies are hit and miss just like their typically upscale theatrical run brethren so that's no excuse for this slop. Budgetary constraints are no excuse either. Some of the best horrors ever were made on a low budget.First of all, the whole idea was a complete rip-off of another movie which I consider to be a classic. A vengeful spirit, clothed in a black cape riding around on a horse killing people mostly by chopping off their heads. Sound familiar? I won't even name that movie because to put the 2 in the same sentence would be an insult to the better of the 2. However, the man whose face appears on the cover of the DVD had a small role in that movie as well. Speaking of which, Casper Van Dien should know better. Watching the only ""not so special feature"" on this DVD lets you know that he did this movie because of his friendship with whoever had this idea. I'm sure it can be hard for an actor to know how a movie will look when complete. But had I acted in this movie and they showed me this as being the finished product, I would've given them an ultimatum. Don't ever release this junk, take my face off the cover and edit me out of the movie entirely or I'll end the friendship immediately. No amount of money is worth the loss of respect from his following.I'm sort of a Michael Rooker fan and his performance was decent enough. The other four main actors (another male and 3 females) were terrible but I place no blame at their feet. The dialog given to each was insulting. The females were given fancy titles for their military positions but the actors themselves were treated in the same stereo-typical insulting manner. The males, except for maybe their forearms, were covered from head to toe. The females? Skin tight tank tops. These same military trained females were falling, screaming and making bad decisions as if they were in a horror movie from the 1970's.Please pardon me as I'm usually not one to dispense with so much vitriol when reviewing a movie because it's only entertainment. But this movie truly offended me. It's going in the trash immediately after this review is posted. Suffice it to say, there was nothing done well in this movie. I could do better using only my camera phone.Rating: Unless you're taking a college course titled ""Bad Movie Making 101"", don't waste your time.",1,"SO BAD, I WAS ACTUALLY OFFENDED (an honest review...)",1145232000,"04 17, 2006",2006,3255,"['Having', 'watched', 'movie', 'collection', 'watching', 'least', '3', '4', 'times', 'decided', 'buy', 'new', 'movie', 'Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'horrors', 'always', 'section', 'start', 'new', 'movie', 'search', 'rounded', 'corner', 'huge', 'electronics', 'super', 'store', 'know', 'name', 'approached', 'S', 'section', 'eyes', 'were', 'drawn', 'Skeleton', 'Man', 'Everything', 'packaging', 'excellent', 'cover', 'photo', '2', 'actors', 'who', 'respect', 'description', 'back', 'made', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'least', 'decent', 'quality', 'extremely', 'low', 'purchase', 'price', 'convinced', 'make', 'purchase', 'Would', 'land', 'diamond', 'rough', 'paraphrase', 'Malcolm', 'X', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hoodwinked', 'bamboozled', 'lead', 'astray', 'run', 'amuck', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'EVER', ""'m"", 'very', 'forgiving', 'bad', 'movies', 'truly', 'unacceptable', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'learned', 'was', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'sponsored', 'movie', 'Fine', 'Made', 'TV', 'movies', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'just', 'typically', 'upscale', 'theatrical', 'run', 'brethren', 'excuse', 'slop', 'Budgetary', 'constraints', 'are', 'excuse', 'best', 'horrors', 'ever', 'were', 'made', 'low', 'budget.First', 'whole', 'idea', 'was', 'complete', 'rip-off', 'movie', 'consider', 'be', 'classic', 'vengeful', 'spirit', 'clothed', 'black', 'cape', 'riding', 'around', 'horse', 'killing', 'people', 'mostly', 'chopping', 'off', 'heads', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'name', 'movie', 'put', '2', 'same', 'sentence', 'would', 'be', 'insult', 'better', '2', 'However', 'man', 'face', 'cover', 'DVD', 'had', 'small', 'role', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Speaking', 'Casper', 'Van', 'Dien', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'Watching', 'only', 'not', 'so', 'special', 'feature', 'DVD', 'know', 'did', 'movie', 'friendship', 'whoever', 'had', 'idea', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'actor', 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'will', 'look', 'when', 'complete', 'had', 'acted', 'movie', 'showed', 'being', 'finished', 'product', 'would', ""'ve"", 'given', 'ultimatum', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'release', 'junk', 'take', 'face', 'cover', 'edit', 'movie', 'entirely', ""'ll"", 'end', 'friendship', 'immediately', 'amount', 'money', 'loss', 'respect', 'following.I', ""'m"", 'sort', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'fan', 'performance', 'was', 'decent', 'enough', 'other', 'four', 'main', 'actors', 'male', '3', 'females', 'were', 'terrible', 'place', 'blame', 'feet', 'dialog', 'given', 'was', 'insulting', 'females', 'were', 'given', 'fancy', 'titles', 'military', 'positions', 'actors', 'were', 'treated', 'same', 'stereo-typical', 'insulting', 'manner', 'males', 'maybe', 'forearms', 'were', 'covered', 'head', 'toe', 'females', 'Skin', 'tight', 'tank', 'tops', 'same', 'military', 'trained', 'females', 'were', 'falling', 'screaming', 'making', 'bad', 'decisions', 'were', 'horror', 'movie', ""1970's.Please"", 'pardon', ""'m"", 'usually', 'not', 'one', 'dispense', 'so', 'much', 'vitriol', 'when', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'only', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'truly', 'offended', 'going', 'trash', 'immediately', 'review', 'posted', 'Suffice', 'say', 'was', 'nothing', 'done', 'well', 'movie', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'using', 'only', 'camera', 'phone.Rating', ""'re"", 'taking', 'college', 'course', 'titled', 'Bad', 'Movie', 'Making', '101', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time']",N/A
940471,A2DKARU8OOUDJV,B000BCKFHK,"M. Bartel ""FAIZ""","[0, 0]","The concept seems pretty decent and the Skeleton man himself seemed like a good idea.  That is about as far as this movie went.Locations are look nice, but the cast in general and dialogue are pretty lame.  The skeleton man himself is poorly wardrobed - sometimes interesting with the tattered look, but most of the time in a silly Halloween costume with shimmering material and a hood clearly held upright around the face with cardboard.  I think if they got the look of the Skeleton man down, it could have been a little better.Locations have a problem since in the beginning it makes it appear like it is a secluded area in a wilderness reached only by helicopter - yet in some of the dialogue it is a &#34;civilian area&#34; - there is some dude fishing from a sheer cliff in the middle of nowhere that apparently only survivalists or military can reach.  There is also a major highway nearby and some underground boiler room type facility - locations make no sense in that regard.The special forces &#34;they&#34; whoever they are send out really don't look the part or act professional.  The females are all young and in tight tanktops - labeled usually as &#34;Instructors&#34; yet showing little competence or knowledge of their profession or even survival skills - certainly not looking military aside from not putting much makeup on.... i guess this was the best they could scrape together.  Sometimes they try to move silently with hand gestures and others they are having long drawn out discussions.Now i am pretty sure they at some point notice that Skeleton man can generally teleport, he does it quite a bit but that doesn't stop them from thinking bullets might hurt him as they keep shooting and shooting and shooting yet not hurting him.  Do they come up with a new plan?  Well, it takes about 6 deaths before they even try to rethink their strategy.Like i said, the Skeleton Man himself as a concept could have worked nicely - hell even the special forces unit but this was just executed in all the wrong ways by what would appear to be a new writer, told the general idea and to come up with a story and script in 2 days.  Oh and padding the movie with a shot of a female eagle screeching... why?!?!?!?  All i can guess is it tries to keep the link of a robed skeleton man connected to some ancient tribe concept they flashed back to a couple times... and back to locations - why is there a chemical plant out here?  Why did they need a special ops group to trudge through vast wilderness when you can just drive up in vehicles?  Why does Skelly with one swing of an axe blow the plant up?  and why bother?

What's it about?SKELETOR: I play a Native American Indian named Cottonmouth Joe who rises from the dead and goes on a killing spree.HE-MAN: Seriously? You're the whitest guy I know.SKELETOR: That's funny, I was going to say the same thing about you.HE-MAN: Cottonmouth Joe sounds like some bad country rap act.SKELETOR: Well you wouldn't be laughing if you were Delta Force.  I killed all those guys, including the stupid archeologist and the hot chicks in tight tank tops who are underwater demolition specialists--HE-MAN: Wait.  This movie takes place underwater?SKELETOR: No.HE-MAN: So why did they send an underwater demolition specialist after you?SKELETOR: I don't know man, I just ride a horse and shoot people with arrows when I'm not stabbing them with spears or chopping their heads off with my awesome medieval sword.HE-MAN: There are so many things wrong with that sentence...I didn't know you could shoot a bow.SKELETOR: I can't.  But they put it in later with digital effects.  Isn't CGI awesome?HE-MAN: Yeah, awesome.SKELETOR: Hey don't laugh! Casper Van Diem is in it...or at least he was until he walked off the set.HE-MAN: What happened?SKELETOR: I don't know, this truck driver pulled over for no reason, Casper hopped in to drive it, tried to run me over, I warped out (I can do that you know) and then we don't see him anymore.HE-MAN: This movie was so bad that Casper Van Diem couldn't stick with it?SKELETOR: Shut up. This movie is my best work yet. The awesome ending takes place between me and a Delta Force guy in a chemical plant.HE-MAN: Oh that sounds cool. How do you die?SKELETOR: I get electrocuted.HE-MAN: In a chemical plant?SKELETOR: Yeah.  Hey!  Where are you going? I'm auditioning for the part of a Nazgul in the sequel!
