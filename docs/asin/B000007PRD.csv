495092,A10EH95EUDO9W3,B000007PRD,"Banshee ""Beeyotch""","[0, 0]","I remember watching two parts of this old animated show based on a classic children's epic on the TV perhaps over two decades ago and I can recall nearly all of it - from beginning to end. The animation may be simplistic, but the story itself is quite gripping and it also had some very good  visual effects as well to enhance it. No one who had ever seen it will  forget the witch's beguilling charms as she feeds innocent young Edmund  some luscious chocolates, nor the Faun's tears rolling down his cheeks as  he stood frozen by the witch's gates, nor the fate of the poor woodland  critters as they were mercilessly turned into stone, nor the very end where  all the children grew up into handsome kings and beautiful queens with  long, flowing hair as they go out hunting for the White Stag. And perhaps  the most memorable part of all is when Aslan was so cruelly slain on the  great altar as the poor, frightened girls watched from their hiding places.  I just can't forget such a noble creature like Aslan laying dead on the  cold stone with his majestic mane so brutally shorn off. Now, I would love  to have this very video someday so I can relive such an astonishing fairy  tale like this once again!",5,Very vivid memories right out of the past!,956361600,"04 22, 2000",2000,1211,"['remember', 'watching', 'two', 'parts', 'old', 'animated', 'show', 'based', 'classic', 'children', 'epic', 'TV', 'perhaps', 'two', 'decades', 'can', 'recall', 'nearly', 'beginning', 'end', 'animation', 'may', 'be', 'simplistic', 'story', 'quite', 'gripping', 'also', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'visual', 'effects', 'as', 'well', 'enhance', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'will', 'forget', 'witch', 'beguilling', 'charms', 'innocent', 'young', 'Edmund', 'luscious', 'chocolates', 'Faun', 'tears', 'rolling', 'down', 'cheeks', 'stood', 'frozen', 'witch', 'gates', 'fate', 'poor', 'woodland', 'critters', 'were', 'mercilessly', 'turned', 'stone', 'very', 'end', 'where', 'children', 'grew', 'up', 'handsome', 'kings', 'beautiful', 'queens', 'long', 'flowing', 'hair', 'go', 'out', 'hunting', 'White', 'Stag', 'perhaps', 'most', 'memorable', 'part', 'when', 'Aslan', 'was', 'so', 'cruelly', 'slain', 'great', 'altar', 'poor', 'frightened', 'girls', 'watched', 'hiding', 'places', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'such', 'noble', 'creature', 'Aslan', 'laying', 'dead', 'cold', 'stone', 'majestic', 'mane', 'so', 'brutally', 'shorn', 'off', 'Now', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'very', 'video', 'someday', 'can', 'relive', 'such', 'astonishing', 'fairy', 'tale', 'once', 'again']",N/A
495093,APP5MBH2BSX6I,B000007PRD,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[10, 12]","For those unfamiliar with the story, this is an allegory for the story of salvation through Jesus Christ.  Even without the spiritual understanding, however, it's a captivating fantasy story, part of a seven-book series written decades ago by British scholar/apologist C.S. Lewis, and this filmed version (originally broadcast on the BBC in England and on PBS in the States) does a beautiful job of capturing the spirit of the story and its characters.My 5-year-old daughter, thankfully, loves it as much as I do.  The story essentially includes four London children in 1940 who are spending their school holiday (summer vacation) in the country, sent by parents who are worried for their lives in wartime in London, when Hitler was intent on bombing that city into oblivion.  They discover a hidden door to a magical world of fawns, nymphs, talking animals, giants, a white witch, and a majestic lion called Aslan.And oh, what a lion!  If only the filmmakers had been able to better solve the problem of making a lion's mouth speak English.  Therein lies the only problem I have with anything about this film (first in a series of three films about the Narnia Chronicles).  The lion costume is spectacular otherwise, but the FX are severely curtailed by a BBC budget.  Some of the more magical creatures, when the filmmakers couldn't put an actor into a costume, were simply drawn, creating a jarring effect.  Even my 5-year-old asked why the flying horse was a drawing.If this series could be redone with 21st-century FX and a ""Lord Of the Rings"" budget, it would be equally spectacular.  But we have what we have, and what we have is uplifting, enchanting, memorable, and thoroughly entertaining.  Suitably melodramatic at times, with the kind of uneven acting one might expect from children and other disguised little people, it plays like an upscale ""Doctor Who"" episode with a gospel overtone.  And yes, that's a good thing.  (In fact, ""Doctor Who"" actor Tom Baker plays a major role in the third part of this series, ""The Silver Chair."")",4,If only they'd had a better budget!,1045785600,"02 21, 2003",2003,2044,"['unfamiliar', 'story', 'allegory', 'story', 'salvation', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Even', 'spiritual', 'understanding', 'however', 'captivating', 'fantasy', 'story', 'part', 'seven-book', 'series', 'written', 'decades', 'British', 'scholar/apologist', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'filmed', 'version', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'BBC', 'England', 'PBS', 'States', 'beautiful', 'job', 'capturing', 'spirit', 'story', 'characters.My', '5-year-old', 'daughter', 'thankfully', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'story', 'essentially', 'four', 'London', 'children', '1940', 'who', 'are', 'spending', 'school', 'holiday', 'summer', 'vacation', 'country', 'sent', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'worried', 'lives', 'wartime', 'London', 'when', 'Hitler', 'was', 'intent', 'bombing', 'city', 'oblivion', 'discover', 'hidden', 'door', 'magical', 'world', 'fawns', 'nymphs', 'talking', 'animals', 'giants', 'white', 'witch', 'majestic', 'lion', 'called', 'Aslan.And', 'oh', 'what', 'lion', 'only', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'better', 'solve', 'problem', 'making', 'lion', 'mouth', 'speak', 'English', 'Therein', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'anything', 'film', 'first', 'series', 'three', 'films', 'Narnia', 'Chronicles', 'lion', 'costume', 'spectacular', 'otherwise', 'FX', 'are', 'severely', 'curtailed', 'BBC', 'budget', 'more', 'magical', 'creatures', 'when', 'filmmakers', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'actor', 'costume', 'were', 'simply', 'drawn', 'creating', 'jarring', 'effect', 'Even', '5-year-old', 'asked', 'why', 'flying', 'horse', 'was', 'drawing.If', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'redone', '21st-century', 'FX', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'budget', 'would', 'be', 'equally', 'spectacular', 'have', 'what', 'have', 'what', 'have', 'uplifting', 'enchanting', 'memorable', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'Suitably', 'melodramatic', 'times', 'kind', 'uneven', 'acting', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'children', 'other', 'disguised', 'little', 'people', 'upscale', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'episode', 'gospel', 'overtone', 'yes', 'good', 'thing', 'fact', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'major', 'role', 'third', 'part', 'series', 'Silver', 'Chair']",N/A

495096,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000007PRD,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[8, 11]","Last December, C.S. Lewis's ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" followed in the footsteps of the ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy,"" with a gleaming new big-screen adaptation.And despite the new movie's presence, it's worth taking a trip back to the 1988 adaptation of Lewis's book, produced by the BBC. It's evenly divided between good and bad -- good scripting and some good acting, but also some poor acting and sketchy direction.The four Pevensie children arrive in the country, at the start of World War II. Despite the eccentric but friendly professor (Michael Aldridge) who lives there, they're all bored. And during a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy (Sophie Wilcox) slips into an old wardrobe -- and finds that the back of it opens into a magical, snowy forest land called Narnia. She encounters a friendly faun, but when she arrives back home, she finds that none of her siblings believe her.But soon Lucy and her siblings find their way through -- not knowing that peevish Edmund (Jonathan R. Scott) has already allied himself to the evil White Witch (Barbara Kellerman) who keeps Narnia locked in winter. She's especially desperate, because Narnia is beginning to thaw out, now that leonine Aslan is coming back to it, and the Pevensie kids have shown up to fulfil an old prophecy. But the Witch won't go down without a massive battle -- and one that might destroy the lion-messiah himself.""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is a mixed bag -- it has more or less equal measures of good and bad. What it also has is deep fidelity to Lewis's original book, which was one of the first major fantasies to get widespread attention. And that's definitely an important detail, since the spirit of the book could easily have been lost.The filmmakers obviously did their homework, crafting the script and dialogue to be close to Lewis's novel. And it's a credit that they pulled off some lines that could have sounded idiotic (""You're not dead, Aslan!"" ""Do I look dead?"") in the wrong hands. They also did an excellent job of changing atmosphere, shifting from the stodgy English country house to the airy frozen Narnia, with its castles and dewy wildlands.Unfortunately, the special effects haven't aged well. They were state of the art at the time, but now they look quite cheesy and low budget, with a few exceptions -- the scene where Lucy restores various ""statued"" people to life is pretty good. The other stuff ranged from primitive bluescreen to an enormous puppet playing Aslan. It's a good puppet, and remarkably convincing physically, but it still makes Aslan look like he has a wicked case of arthritis.The acting is also divided between good and bad. Scott is particularly good as the ""bad boy"" Edmund, who ends up falling in with the Witch, especially when he turns on his evil mentor. He is accompanied by some good acting from Sophie Cook as Susan, and Richatd Dempsey as Peter, who also has to do a convincing battle with a werewolf. The weak links are Wilcox, who speaks most of her lines in a whine, and Kellerman, who laughs madly, coos and shrieks, and generally hams it up like a lunatic.While the new version of  ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" has captured the imaginations of moviegoers, the BBC version is still worth taking a look at.",3,"The Lion, the Witch, and the BBC",1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,3265,"['Last', 'December', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'followed', 'footsteps', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Trilogy', 'gleaming', 'new', 'big-screen', 'adaptation.And', 'new', 'movie', 'presence', 'worth', 'taking', 'trip', 'back', '1988', 'adaptation', 'Lewis', 'book', 'produced', 'BBC', 'evenly', 'divided', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'scripting', 'good', 'acting', 'also', 'poor', 'acting', 'sketchy', 'direction.The', 'four', 'Pevensie', 'children', 'arrive', 'country', 'start', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'eccentric', 'friendly', 'professor', 'Michael', 'Aldridge', 'who', 'there', ""'re"", 'bored', 'game', 'hide-and-seek', 'Lucy', 'Sophie', 'Wilcox', 'old', 'wardrobe', 'back', 'magical', 'snowy', 'forest', 'land', 'called', 'Narnia', 'friendly', 'faun', 'when', 'back', 'home', 'none', 'siblings', 'believe', 'her.But', 'soon', 'Lucy', 'siblings', 'find', 'way', 'not', 'knowing', 'peevish', 'Edmund', 'Jonathan', 'R.', 'Scott', 'already', 'allied', 'evil', 'White', 'Witch', 'Barbara', 'Kellerman', 'who', 'Narnia', 'locked', 'winter', 'especially', 'desperate', 'Narnia', 'beginning', 'thaw', 'out', 'now', 'leonine', 'Aslan', 'coming', 'back', 'Pevensie', 'kids', 'have', 'shown', 'up', 'fulfil', 'old', 'prophecy', 'Witch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'massive', 'battle', 'one', 'might', 'destroy', 'lion-messiah', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'mixed', 'bag', 'more', 'less', 'equal', 'measures', 'good', 'bad', 'What', 'also', 'deep', 'fidelity', 'Lewis', 'original', 'book', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'major', 'fantasies', 'get', 'widespread', 'attention', 'definitely', 'important', 'detail', 'spirit', 'book', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'lost.The', 'filmmakers', 'obviously', 'did', 'homework', 'crafting', 'script', 'dialogue', 'be', 'close', 'Lewis', 'novel', 'credit', 'pulled', 'off', 'lines', 'could', 'have', 'sounded', 'idiotic', ""'re"", 'not', 'dead', 'Aslan', 'Do', 'look', 'dead', 'wrong', 'hands', 'also', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'changing', 'atmosphere', 'shifting', 'stodgy', 'English', 'country', 'house', 'airy', 'frozen', 'Narnia', 'castles', 'dewy', 'wildlands.Unfortunately', 'special', 'effects', 'have', ""n't"", 'aged', 'well', 'were', 'state', 'art', 'time', 'now', 'look', 'quite', 'cheesy', 'low', 'budget', 'few', 'exceptions', 'scene', 'where', 'Lucy', 'various', 'statued', 'people', 'life', 'pretty', 'good', 'other', 'stuff', 'ranged', 'primitive', 'bluescreen', 'enormous', 'puppet', 'playing', 'Aslan', 'good', 'puppet', 'remarkably', 'convincing', 'physically', 'still', 'Aslan', 'look', 'wicked', 'case', 'arthritis.The', 'acting', 'also', 'divided', 'good', 'bad', 'Scott', 'particularly', 'good', 'bad', 'boy', 'Edmund', 'who', 'up', 'falling', 'Witch', 'especially', 'when', 'evil', 'mentor', 'accompanied', 'good', 'acting', 'Sophie', 'Cook', 'Susan', 'Richatd', 'Dempsey', 'Peter', 'who', 'also', 'do', 'convincing', 'battle', 'werewolf', 'weak', 'links', 'are', 'Wilcox', 'who', 'most', 'lines', 'whine', 'Kellerman', 'who', 'madly', 'coos', 'shrieks', 'generally', 'hams', 'up', 'lunatic.While', 'new', 'version', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'captured', 'imaginations', 'moviegoers', 'BBC', 'version', 'still', 'worth', 'taking', 'look']",N/A
495097,A2OP1HD9RGX5OW,B000007PRD,"Jedidiah Palosaari ""Not My Real Name""","[5, 9]","I love the books, and think of them as some of the best literature ever written.  I enjoyed watching the animated movie as a kid, but longed for something that was more real- namely, live action.  And in an age when Harry Potter is big, and The Lord of the Rings has been updated into live action from it's original animation, why not also Narnia?  And here it is.It kept very close to the book, which was helpful.  And it is overwhelmingly British- which is just right, since Lewis was British and wrote about British children.  This is a production that needed to be done in England to do it right.  The acting is certainly superior to anything you see in Harry Potter, thank God- these children can actually act, and emote.  But as many have pointed out, the special effects really drag the movie down.  It's a bit odd, as the movie obviously has the money for location shooting that put it above a high-school project.  But every little while through the movie, you see bits that look like high-schoolers plugged sequences in.  The beavers look like people in costumes, with make-up.  There's no attempt to hide that they are people.  The wolf transforms (very sloppily) from a dog into a guy in a wolf costume, who doesn't look scary as much as humorous.  A bit of Babe or Animal Farm (live-action version) technology, with talking animals, would have done well here, and not have been that hard to do.  And the painted mythological creatures are really badly done.  A computer would have touched this up very easily, very cheaply, to make the special effects realistic- or even some costumes for mythological creatures.The telling point is a final fight scene between Peter and a wolf, in which the background suddenly changes, inexplicably, into a set for a play, throughout the entire fight.  It was then that I realized that this would make an excellent play.  There was nothing wrong with the acting, or costumes, or sets, were this a play.  It just doesn't measure up to what we have come to expect from movies or even TV.The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Widescreen Edition)",3,"Great to see, but could have been better.",1081468800,"04 9, 2004",2004,2117,"['love', 'books', 'think', 'best', 'literature', 'ever', 'written', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'animated', 'movie', 'kid', 'longed', 'something', 'was', 'more', 'real-', 'namely', 'live', 'action', 'age', 'when', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'big', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'been', 'updated', 'live', 'action', 'original', 'animation', 'why', 'not', 'also', 'Narnia', 'here', 'kept', 'very', 'close', 'book', 'was', 'helpful', 'overwhelmingly', 'British-', 'just', 'right', 'Lewis', 'was', 'British', 'wrote', 'British', 'children', 'production', 'needed', 'be', 'done', 'England', 'do', 'right', 'acting', 'certainly', 'superior', 'anything', 'see', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'thank', 'God-', 'children', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'emote', 'many', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'drag', 'movie', 'down', 'bit', 'odd', 'movie', 'obviously', 'money', 'location', 'shooting', 'put', 'high-school', 'project', 'little', 'movie', 'see', 'bits', 'look', 'high-schoolers', 'plugged', 'sequences', 'beavers', 'look', 'people', 'costumes', 'make-up', 'attempt', 'hide', 'are', 'people', 'wolf', 'transforms', 'very', 'sloppily', 'dog', 'guy', 'wolf', 'costume', 'who', ""n't"", 'look', 'scary', 'as', 'much', 'humorous', 'bit', 'Babe', 'Animal', 'Farm', 'live-action', 'version', 'technology', 'talking', 'animals', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'here', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'do', 'painted', 'mythological', 'creatures', 'are', 'really', 'badly', 'done', 'computer', 'would', 'have', 'touched', 'up', 'very', 'easily', 'very', 'cheaply', 'make', 'special', 'effects', 'realistic-', 'even', 'costumes', 'mythological', 'creatures.The', 'telling', 'point', 'final', 'fight', 'scene', 'Peter', 'wolf', 'background', 'suddenly', 'changes', 'inexplicably', 'set', 'play', 'entire', 'fight', 'was', 'then', 'realized', 'would', 'make', 'excellent', 'play', 'was', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'acting', 'costumes', 'sets', 'were', 'play', 'just', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'what', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'movies', 'even', 'TV.The', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'Widescreen', 'Edition']",N/A

extras (as has happened with a few films in the past; The Hitch-Hikers Guide To The Galaxy, for instance, even though I still find the BBC mini series of that, better, I now like the film MUCH more then I did upon first viewing)...I actually, almost, had myself deluded into thinking that the movie and its unnecessary need to veer away from the book in both words and events, wasn't, so bad...Then a neat thing happened to me, while researching another movie, I discovered that there was a REMASTERED edition of the original BBC mini series, on DVD coming to Canada on April 25, 2006 from Morningstar Entertainment (and already available in the U.S. through Image) and I happened to luck out and find a place that had the U.S. version in stock, for a relatively decent price (19.99 Canadian funds + tax) here in Canada.So, I scrapped some money together (payday wasn't till Friday, and it was only Monday) picked it up, played it as soon as I got home, and suddenly, the mind laps that had me thinking that the movie wasn't so bad, was gone, for here was the real story of the wondrous land of Narnia, come to life, in all of it's glorious verse and imagery, and with no pointless need for veering from the original source material, to achieve this.As for the newly remastered picture, well, there's still a slight bit of the ghosting that had plagued the original DVD, but the picture is much clearer, colours are much more vibrant (although, on occasion, the colour saturation is so strong that it almost looks like it had been colourized, but not enough to ruin the experience, on the contrary, as it tends to give the whole thing a more fairy tale look) and the White Witch, actually has a white, instead of off grey, complexion (which in itself is a great improvement over the older disc).Okay, granted the F/X's are kind of hooky by today's, ""Lord Of The Rings"", standards, but what it lacks in flash, it more then makes up for in heart (where as the movie, is the exact opposite, having all the flash that money can buy, but very little of the heart of the original story).So if flashy F/X are all that you crave, then I guess the new movie is for you, but if you want to feel like a kid again, feel the magic that reading the books for the first time instilled within you, then the BBC mini series is the way to go.Here's hopping that the rest of the BBC Narnia mini series get the remastered treatment, and soon :)",5,"Conserning The, BBC ""REMASTERED"" DVD Version",1145836800,"04 24, 2006",2006,2751,"['wanted', 'love', 'new', 'movie',
