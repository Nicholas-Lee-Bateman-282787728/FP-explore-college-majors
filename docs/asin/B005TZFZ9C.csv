1503964,A1F7YU6O5RU432,B005TZFZ9C,Angela Streiff,"[0, 0]","Volume 2 of Storage Wars (aka: half of Season 2) is just as great as Season 1, filled with much of the same kinds of drama. There's the same fighting (some a bit more intense than before), rare finds, messy storage units and Barry showing up with all kinds of funny people.Darrell seems to spend most of all these episodes on the sidelines, not bidding on much. But he's always there to partake in the bidding drama. Jarrod and his wife have obviously been having good business in their store after Season 1, since they appear to have quite a bit more spending money to buy units in Season 2. They are definitely much more of a contender in this season than they were in the last, often outbidding the king of the Storage Wars, Dave. There are lots of appearances by the familiar appraisers, each helping put a value on the odd and rare items that are found in the units.As noted by others, this ""Volume 2"" is only part of the second season. I suspect Volume 3 (when released) will be the other half of the second season, which may very well confuse some buyers. I can see people looking to buy Season 3, buying Volume 3 and being disappointed when they discover it's the second half to Season 2. So just be sure to check and see what volume you're buying has the episodes your looking for.",5,"Love the show, but wish ""Volume 2"" contained everything from ""Season 2""",1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,1290,"['Volume', '2', 'Storage', 'Wars', 'aka', 'half', 'Season', '2', 'just', 'as', 'great', 'Season', '1', 'filled', 'much', 'same', 'kinds', 'drama', 'same', 'fighting', 'bit', 'more', 'intense', 'before', 'rare', 'finds', 'messy', 'storage', 'units', 'Barry', 'showing', 'up', 'kinds', 'funny', 'people.Darrell', 'spend', 'most', 'episodes', 'sidelines', 'not', 'bidding', 'much', 'always', 'there', 'partake', 'bidding', 'drama', 'Jarrod', 'wife', 'have', 'obviously', 'been', 'having', 'good', 'business', 'store', 'Season', '1', 'appear', 'have', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'spending', 'money', 'buy', 'units', 'Season', '2', 'are', 'definitely', 'much', 'more', 'contender', 'season', 'were', 'last', 'often', 'outbidding', 'king', 'Storage', 'Wars', 'Dave', 'are', 'lots', 'appearances', 'familiar', 'appraisers', 'helping', 'put', 'value', 'odd', 'rare', 'items', 'are', 'found', 'units.As', 'noted', 'others', 'Volume', '2', 'only', 'part', 'second', 'season', 'suspect', 'Volume', '3', 'when', 'released', 'will', 'be', 'other', 'half', 'second', 'season', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'confuse', 'buyers', 'can', 'see', 'people', 'looking', 'buy', 'Season', '3', 'buying', 'Volume', '3', 'being', 'disappointed', 'when', 'discover', 'second', 'half', 'Season', '2', 'So', 'just', 'be', 'sure', 'check', 'see', 'what', 'volume', ""'re"", 'buying', 'episodes', 'looking']",Storage Wars: Season 2

Cooper,"[2, 3]","While I agree that it would be a good thing if more episodes were on this volume, I will review what IS here and not what isn't here.The 14 episodes that are here are very entertaining and enjoyable. I think the key to this show's success is the interesting characters. I saw a copycat show on another network dealing with buyers bidding on storage lockers and it was really bad. This show uses the framework of the storage lockers to present Barry's offbeat and funny humor,Dave and Darrell's childish and petty arguements and Brandi and Jarrod's struggles to break into the business. They'll show some interesting antiques and novelties as well but the real winning formula is the interactions of the characters.Even the Texas version of the show made by the same producers and network isn't as good as their characters aren't as entertaining. This is the original Storage Locker show and I suspect it'd be a good show if you had these characters exploring caves  or commenting on baseball games or travelling to exotic places.

1503972,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005TZFZ9C,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[40, 40]","Explanation For Lower Rating:Once upon a time, when you bought a TV show on DVD--it tended to be an entire season.  People who bought complete seasons of some of History's reality hits were surprised by later offerings such as ""Pawn Stars: Volume Three"" and ""American Pickers: Volume Two.""  Both of those shows had released Complete Seasons previously, but suddenly switched to these ""Volumes.""  I know people that preordered sight unseen, or just weren't paying attention, felt a little shortchanged by these smaller portions as opposed to what they had assumed were full season DVD releases. Personally, I didn't agree with the decision--but, at least, the DVD packaging was very clear about what was included. Anyone who read the box knew what to expect--how many episodes and which ones, so it wasn't a blind investment!Not so for A&E;'s ""Storage Wars, Volume Two!""  People who bought ""Storage Wars Season One"" should NOT expect a full Season Two set this time around.  That's their choice, but what is unforgivable is that the packaging does not tell the consumer what they are buying.  I am sitting here with the DVD in hand and nowhere does it say how many episodes are inside. Never mind that it doesn't list them (which in my opinion it should if it is not a Complete Season package)--it doesn't even tell you how many episodes you are getting. I suppose I'm supposed to look at the running time and do some estimated mathematics? I know this may seem trivial to some or that I'm overreacting, but I think the company owes potential buyers this information. My lower rating, therefore, reflects A&E; Networks Distributing apparent disregard for its own fan base. I don't like to make purchases without knowing exactly what I'm paying for!I, however, will tell you what is inside. The 2 DVD set has fourteen episodes, the first of Season Two. Really, how hard would it have been to include the fact that there were fourteen episodes on the DVD box?  FOR THE RECORD: I DON'T MIND VOLUME SET DVDs FOR A LOWER PRICE, I MIND HAVING NO IDEA AS A SHOPPER WHAT THAT SET INCLUDES (EVEN WHEN LOOKING DIRECTLY AT THE DVD).Episodes: (1) Hang Em High Desert, (2) Buyers on the Storm, (3) Pay the Lady, (4) Santa Ana Street Fight, (5) Unclaimed Baggage, (6) Enemy of the Enemy, (7) Fire in the Hole, (8) San Burrito, (9) Tanks for the Memories, (10) Land of the Loss, (11) Almost the Greatest Show on Earth, (12) Bowling for Dollars, (13) Get Him To The Mayan, and (14) FU Dog Day Afternoon.Actual Review:I will be brief in my actual review since I already went on a tirade.  A&E;'s reality hit ""Storage Wars"" has the irresistible allure of a modern day treasure hunt. It is dumpster diving for the age of economic default. As with most reality programming, there is a bit of contrivance to the set-up. A crew of easily definable characters is established that will be your guides.  These entrepreneurs go to auctions to purchase unclaimed and unpaid storage facilities. With only a few minutes to peruse the contents of a unit from afar (they aren't allowed into a space or to touch anything), they must decide whether or not to bid on the property. Using savvy or instinct, it's pay and play for our heroes--who sometimes score big rewards or major disappointment.  While, to my mind, the concept alone doesn't necessarily scream entertainment--there is no denying the fascination in this culture of uncovering something for nothing. Of course, the idea is to claim a space for the lowest price possible, but bidders oftentimes drive the auction up on one another simply to deplete their cash supply. Every transaction is done with folding money only, so any apparent treasures tend to go to the party with the largest stack.  It's a terrifically fun and entertaining show as long as you don't think too much about the sad underbelly of what is actually happening and why there is so much unclaimed merchandise!

The other half will be release later on.This show is back and it's better than last season. Everyone has returned for more and better storage units.For the new season, the show tried to introduce a new character, Mark. He is only in there for a few shows, but he made a statement. He is this really big/strong looking guy that has millions. He loves to push out the other characters from an auction with his money. If he wants it, there's no unit he would not buy.  This makes him a very dangerous buyer to all the other buyers. The other characters think they can make him lose out on many units by bidding higher and making him really pay for them, but Mark seems like he just doesn't care if he does. To him, its like a game that he must win. He is not living on storage unit to storage unit like the others are. Mark does this as a hobby and not a real job.Some other things to say for this season. Barry is the only one that can get along with every person on the show. There's just something about him that doesn't get on peoples nerves as the other characters hate everyone else there. I think it's because he's not there so much to make it rich as compared to the others and he keeps a lot of stuff. Also, he tends to give away his stuff he finds.
