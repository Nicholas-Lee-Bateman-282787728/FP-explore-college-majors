581490,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00005BJW9,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[8, 9]","Despite the fact that my initial interest in this DVD was the opportunity to see Patsy Kensit, I actually found Jurgen Prochnow and Elizabeth Hurley to be far more entertaining as (respectfully) the skipper of a private yacht and a passenger desperately trying to reach the Bahama's.Although her role is pivotal to the plot, Kensit plays her part as a whiney, insecure sidekick to Hurley's. Her character really only seems to serve as a catalyst to engender a bond between Prochnow's skipper and Hurley's flamboyant passenger in addition to adding some sense of reason to a twist at the end that has me still scratching my head.This movie was marketed as another trip into ""Deep Calm"" waters but in actual fact the expected confrontation that the movie seems to be inevitably  steering towards never occurs, this probably greatly contributed to the lackluster performance of the movie but for me the picture took more interesting turns into examining some really warped human behavior and building distrust between the three people stuck on a small boat together for four weeks.Prochnow plays a washed out sailor who, after a tragic event at sea, has not had the courage to leave port for months. Following an intoxicated meeting with two female entertainers (Kensit and Hurley) he subsequently finds out that he has agreed to take the two carefree women on a four week sail to the Bahama's.What follows is a roller coaster of human emotion, suspense, sex (nudity from Hurley) and confusion. The movie however never seems to find its niche though and its twist is underwhelming and unsatisfying. So much more should have been delivered, especially with such an attractive cast, but the screen time and talent seems wasted.Perhaps this is the reason this movie has been marketed under so many titles. Its original German title was `Der Skipper', but its also been named `The Storm.'",3,A suspense thriller that lacks suspense,1102896000,"12 13, 2004",2004,1881,"['fact', 'initial', 'interest', 'DVD', 'was', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Patsy', 'Kensit', 'actually', 'found', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'respectfully', 'skipper', 'private', 'yacht', 'passenger', 'desperately', 'trying', 'reach', ""Bahama's.Although"", 'role', 'pivotal', 'plot', 'Kensit', 'part', 'whiney', 'insecure', 'sidekick', 'Hurley', 'character', 'really', 'only', 'serve', 'catalyst', 'engender', 'bond', 'Prochnow', 'skipper', 'Hurley', 'flamboyant', 'passenger', 'addition', 'adding', 'sense', 'reason', 'twist', 'end', 'still', 'scratching', 'head.This', 'movie', 'was', 'marketed', 'trip', 'Deep', 'Calm', 'waters', 'actual', 'fact', 'expected', 'confrontation', 'movie', 'be', 'inevitably', 'steering', 'towards', 'never', 'occurs', 'probably', 'greatly', 'contributed', 'lackluster', 'performance', 'movie', 'picture', 'took', 'more', 'interesting', 'examining', 'really', 'warped', 'human', 'behavior', 'building', 'distrust', 'three', 'people', 'stuck', 'small', 'boat', 'together', 'four', 'weeks.Prochnow', 'washed', 'out', 'sailor', 'who', 'tragic', 'event', 'sea', 'not', 'had', 'courage', 'leave', 'port', 'months', 'Following', 'intoxicated', 'meeting', 'two', 'female', 'entertainers', 'Kensit', 'Hurley', 'subsequently', 'out', 'agreed', 'take', 'two', 'carefree', 'women', 'four', 'week', 'sail', ""Bahama's.What"", 'roller', 'coaster', 'human', 'emotion', 'suspense', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Hurley', 'confusion', 'movie', 'however', 'never', 'find', 'niche', 'twist', 'underwhelming', 'unsatisfying', 'So', 'much', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'delivered', 'especially', 'such', 'attractive', 'cast', 'screen', 'time', 'talent', 'wasted.Perhaps', 'reason', 'movie', 'been', 'marketed', 'so', 'many', 'titles', 'original', 'German', 'title', 'was', 'Der', 'Skipper', 'also', 'been', 'named', 'Storm']",N/A

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[30, 33]","Jurgen Prochnow, best known for playing the captain of a German submarine in the classic DAS BOAT, once more demonstrates his prowess in fulfilling the role of a sailor.  This time, however, he portrays a washed-up sailor, and the dangers that lurk are far more insidious than the depth charges hurled at him in DAS BOAT.This time around, he is an average-Joe who is hired by two gorgeous women to give them a ride on his schooner.  It's quite a long ride - about a month or more.  The 2 women are played by Elizabeth Hurley & Patsy Kensit.So, you say, sounds like every man's fantasy, right?  To be out to sea with two lovely women all to himself - seems like a pretty good deal.  Only one catch:  both of them turn out to be borderline crazy.Ultimately, there is but one reason to see this movie, and that's to see Kensit & Hurley sport an assortment of bikinis, halter tops, evening gowns & other sexy summmer clothes.  If you're disinterested in these things, you'll likely be disinterested in watching this film.  [The storyline isn't very good, nor is it particularly intriguing]The film would have been better had it been saturated with nudity, but sadly it's not.  It appeared a few times that it was going in that direction, but the movie always seemed to pull back from the threshold at the last moment.Hence, if the fantasy of 2 women on a boat without land in sight is enough to keep your attention for a few hours, this one might be worth a look.

Hurley and Kensit, on a larth, go off on a boat with drunken sailor Prochnow.  Prochnow has a sort of shady past so there is a little bit of tension as sexual tension begins to develop between he and Hurley.  Kensit seems jealous, although whether it's for Prochnow or Hurley we're never really sure.I don't mind not knowing what's going on, but I wish the filmmakers did.  Twists seem to come out of nowhere with no rhyme or reason.  At first, both women seem to view the skipper as a lesser being, a plaything for their amusement.  Then Kensit acts like a spoiled brat for no adequately explained reason.  The final twist comes out of left field.  Sure, I was surprised, but if a big squid would have popped up in the last scene and ate the ship I would be surprised too.  It doesn't mean it's a good ending.  The mysterious coda is the only reason to recommend this other than T & A.  Days later I found myself wondering exactly what did happen.

The first time I saw it, I was bored out of my mind; yet, I knew something was brewing underneath the surface. So, I watched until the end. Then I watched it a second time just to figure out what the heck I saw the first time. I was probably around 12 or so.Anyway, the first time I viewed the film, I kept saying to myself: ""this is called Kill Cruise but nobody's dying on this cruise."" And that might be the biggest downfall of Kill Cruise: there's not much ACTION for the majority of the film. But there is something: a lingering tension and a couple of sex scenes.What's funny is, I had no idea who Liz Hurley or Patsy Kensit were when I saw the movie. I knew their characters' names were Sue and Lou but by the end credits I got the names confused and thought Liz Hurley's name was actually Patsy Kensit and vice versa. It's humorous trying to get someone to recall an actress when you're giving them the wrong name.Bottom Line: It's a cheap little drama about a neurotic, self-centered girl and her shy, quiet friend who go on a boat trip with a man who is suspected of killing his wife's lover.

581494,A3IH2L4B5VOA59,B00005BJW9,"J. Houzet ""wozamoya""","[1, 2]","Kill Cruise is a Dead Calm type thriller, the drama and suspense happening on board a yacht sailing from Gibraltar to Barbados. Jurgen Prochnow plays a washed out sailor. His best friend died at sea under suspicious circumstances and his wife left him soon after. He spends his days in the bars on Gibraltar, muttering his intention to sail away but never doing so. Elizabeth Hurley and Patsy Kensit play two English trollops idling their days away on the island till they decide to go to Barbados. Prochnow is reluctant to be recruited for this trip till provoked to prove he can still sail.The strength of this movie lies in the very realistic irritations played out among three people in close quarters who don't quite trust each other. Patsy Kensit is the painfully self-centered one, vying for the skipper's attention and becoming increasingly jealous and vindictive when he favors Hurley's character. Hurley is submissive and vacuous. There seems to be some lesbian tension between the two girls that further complicates matters. Kensit's snipes at the skipper and paranoid discussions with Hurley escalate into life-threatening behavior. Just when we think things have settled down again there is an inexplicable horrific act.Prochnow and Kensit are the better actors here, and the young Liz Hurley seems to be around as window dressing. I was still surprised that she was the one who went naked, however, in several love scenes with Prochnow. Both of the girls are very pretty, even if their characters are grating. The main problem of this movie is the ""twist"" at the end for which there was no motive.There seem to be a hundred different editions of this movie out there, all released by different distributors. Either the studio sold the rights again and again to make a quick buck, or there's some bootlegging going on.",3,"Yeah, you might enjoy it",1104192000,"12 28, 2004",2004,1831,"['Kill', 'Cruise', 'Dead', 'Calm', 'type', 'thriller', 'drama', 'suspense', 'happening', 'board', 'yacht', 'sailing', 'Gibraltar', 'Barbados', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'washed', 'out', 'sailor', 'best', 'friend', 'died', 'sea', 'suspicious', 'circumstances', 'wife', 'left', 'soon', 'days', 'bars', 'Gibraltar', 'muttering', 'intention', 'sail', 'away', 'never', 'doing', 'so', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'Patsy', 'Kensit', 'play', 'two', 'English', 'trollops', 'idling', 'days', 'away', 'island', 'till', 'decide', 'go', 'Barbados', 'Prochnow', 'reluctant', 'be', 'recruited', 'trip', 'till', 'provoked', 'prove', 'can', 'still', 'sail.The', 'strength', 'movie', 'very', 'realistic', 'irritations', 'played', 'out', 'three', 'people', 'close', 'quarters', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'trust', 'other', 'Patsy', 'Kensit', 'painfully', 'self-centered', 'one', 'vying', 'skipper', 'attention', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'jealous', 'vindictive', 'when', 'Hurley', 'character', 'Hurley', 'submissive', 'vacuous', 'be', 'lesbian', 'tension', 'two', 'girls', 'further', 'complicates', 'matters', 'Kensit', 'snipes', 'skipper', 'paranoid', 'discussions', 'Hurley', 'escalate', 'life-threatening', 'behavior', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'things', 'have', 'settled', 'down', 'again', 'inexplicable', 'horrific', 'act.Prochnow', 'Kensit', 'are', 'better', 'actors', 'here', 'young', 'Liz', 'Hurley', 'be', 'around', 'window', 'dressing', 'was', 'still', 'surprised', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'went', 'naked', 'however', 'several', 'love', 'scenes', 'Prochnow', 'girls', 'are', 'very', 'pretty', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'grating', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'twist', 'end', 'was', 'motive.There', 'seem', 'be', 'hundred', 'different', 'editions', 'movie', 'there', 'released', 'different', 'distributors', 'studio', 'sold', 'rights', 'again', 'again', 'make', 'quick', 'buck', 'bootlegging', 'going']",N/A

Creatively shot, and featuring some solid acting performances, by Jurgen Prochnow, Patsy Kensit, and Elizabeth Hurley, the movie is an interesting character study, with some dramatic and emotional twists.In a bar in the port of Gibraltar, English entertainers Su (Kensit) and Lou (Hurley), hook up with ""the Skipper"", a washed up mariner, who plans to take his boat the Bella Donna to Barbados.  The four week voyage with the two women aboard, is undertaken after a night of drinking, with virtually no thought or advance planning.With little sailing experience, and mostly interested in having fun, the girls have brought along their dog, who fearlessly roams the deck without falling overboard.  The Skipper hasn't done much sailing, since a man died on his boat, and his wife left him.  Things start out fairly well, with the Skipper seemingly taking things in stride, but things begin to deteriorate, as Su begins acting up, while conversely, Lou becomes closer to the Skipper.Things reach a critical point, when Su suspects that the Skipper may have killed his wife, and takes action that puts his life at risk.  The Skipper retaliates by tossing Su into the ocean, and dragging her behind the boat.  Just when things seem to have settled down, madness strikes, sealing the fate of all those aboard.While not very realistic, the lively acting performances make Kill Cruise (aka Der Skipper) an interesting watch.  Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot,The Replacement Killers) is perfect as a burned out mariner.  Their characters probably have no place on a trans Atlantic voyage, but Patsy Kensit (Lethal Weapon 2), and a very thin Elizabeth Hurley (Austin Powers), carry out their roles well, while being very easy on the eyes.",3,"the adventures of the skipper, and his whacky new crew...",1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,1852,"['trans-Atlantic', 'voyage', 'deadly', 'Kill', 'Cruise', '1990', 'drama', 'mostly', 'place', 'small', 'boat', 'bound', 'Barbados', 'Creatively', 'shot', 'featuring', 'solid', 'acting', 'performances', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'Patsy', 'Kensit', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'movie', 'interesting', 'character', 'study', 'dramatic', 'emotional', 'twists.In', 'bar', 'port', 'Gibraltar', 'English', 'entertainers', 'Su', 'Kensit', 'Lou', 'Hurley', 'hook', 'up', 'Skipper', 'washed', 'up', 'mariner', 'who', 'take', 'boat', 'Bella', 'Donna', 'Barbados', 'four', 'week', 'voyage', 'two', 'women', 'undertaken', 'night', 'drinking', 'virtually', 'thought', 'advance', 'planning.With', 'little', 'sailing', 'experience', 'mostly', 'interested', 'having', 'fun', 'girls', 'have', 'brought', 'along', 'dog', 'who', 'fearlessly', 'deck', 'falling', 'overboard', 'Skipper', ""n't"", 'done', 'much', 'sailing', 'man', 'died', 'boat', 'wife', 'left', 'Things', 'start', 'out', 'fairly', 'well', 'Skipper', 'seemingly', 'taking', 'things', 'stride', 'things', 'begin', 'deteriorate', 'Su', 'acting', 'up', 'conversely', 'Lou', 'closer', 'Skipper.Things', 'reach', 'critical', 'point', 'when', 'Su', 'Skipper', 'may', 'have', 'killed', 'wife', 'action', 'life', 'risk', 'Skipper', 'retaliates', 'tossing', 'Su', 'ocean', 'dragging', 'boat', 'Just', 'when', 'things', 'seem', 'have', 'settled', 'down', 'madness', 'strikes', 'sealing', 'fate', 'not', 'very', 'realistic', 'lively', 'acting', 'performances', 'make', 'Kill', 'Cruise', 'aka', 'Der', 'Skipper', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'Das', 'Boot', 'Replacement', 'Killers', 'perfect', 'burned', 'out', 'mariner', 'characters', 'probably', 'have', 'place', 'trans', 'Atlantic', 'voyage', 'Patsy', 'Kensit', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', '2', 'very', 'thin', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'carry', 'out', 'roles', 'well', 'being', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes']",N/A
