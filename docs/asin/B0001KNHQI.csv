In the process of mining an alien vessel has been found. And what do vessels hold. Yep you have just guessed the whole movie.Aka ""The Alien Within"" (1995) TV movie was really cheap in production and acting.  Even of you know the story, sometime the execution can be fun; this one is jejune.

Upon arrival, they find most of the Russian crew dead, and take the comatose sole-survivor back to their facility. Unfortunately, he's brought something w/ him! Now, a parasitic organism is out to enter and possess the crew. It wants to a-sexually reproduce don'cha know! UNKNOWN ORIGIN is another of Roger Corman's ALIEN clones, this time under-water w/ some of THE THING and LEVIATHAN tossed in.

It reminds me of why people went to movie-theatres, sat in the dark and were entertained by having all their buttons pushed in the right way. Unknown Origin falls somewhere between Star Trek and Alien. Considering it was made in 1995 its scientific effects like control panels for example seem sort of 80ish compared to the design wizardry of today. Initially I thought it would turn schmaltzy but not at all. This is because this movie is all about great story-telling through movie- telling It has pace action intrigue humour good drama good sets.

809308,A1UVGM5K7ZMXSN,B0001KNHQI,R.K.,"[0, 1]","The best way I can describe this is, that this movie takes elements from other movies and combines it down to something that as a low budget sci-fi film stand quite well.The basic premise is that like in the film &#34;Leviathan&#34; our cast of characters works on an underwater mining station who are rushing to meet quota before their shift is over and they get leave. They receive a distress call from a nearby Russian station, when they go to investigate they find the corpses of several crew members have been drained of their bodily fluids, they stumble upon two surviors one running in fear of the other, with the other crew member ranting and carrying a gun and saying that something is inside him etc a la &#34;The Thing&#34;.The crew brings the lone Russian survivor back to their station...take a guess what happened to the one with the gun...where he is quarantined and full battery of tests is conducted on him to see how and why he survived what for all intents and purposes they believe to be a viral outbreak. What we come to discover is that the Russians, who were mining as well came across an alien in hibernation deep underground and that is managed to reawaken and attacked the crew.Of course now this alien has a new set of hosts on which to gorge itself while the survivors try to figure out just who is infected and who isn't. There are a few twists with this movie but nothing that we haven't seen in other movies of this type. I mean this movie was made in 1995 so I mean you can sort of see that this movie is really just an amalgam of &#34;Leviathan&#34; 1989, &#34;The Thing&#34; 1982, &#34;Alien&#34; 1979/1986.It isn't a bad movie, but not the greatest, still there are a few twists here and there that made it enjoyable if you can get past the obvious plot points taken from other better know science fiction films of the 80s and 90s.",4,Think Leviathan...Meets The Thing...With Just A Hint Of Alien,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,1866,"['best', 'way', 'can', 'describe', 'movie', 'elements', 'other', 'movies', 'combines', 'down', 'something', 'low', 'budget', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'stand', 'quite', 'well.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'film', '34', 'Leviathan', '34', 'cast', 'characters', 'works', 'underwater', 'mining', 'station', 'who', 'are', 'rushing', 'meet', 'quota', 'shift', 'get', 'leave', 'receive', 'distress', 'call', 'nearby', 'Russian', 'station', 'when', 'go', 'investigate', 'find', 'corpses', 'several', 'crew', 'members', 'have', 'been', 'drained', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'stumble', 'two', 'surviors', 'one', 'running', 'fear', 'other', 'other', 'crew', 'member', 'ranting', 'carrying', 'gun', 'saying', 'something', 'etc', 'la', '34', 'Thing', '34', '.The', 'crew', 'lone', 'Russian', 'survivor', 'back', 'station', 'take', 'guess', 'happened', 'one', 'gun', 'where', 'quarantined', 'full', 'battery', 'tests', 'conducted', 'see', 'how', 'why', 'survived', 'what', 'intents', 'purposes', 'believe', 'be', 'viral', 'outbreak', 'What', 'come', 'discover', 'Russians', 'who', 'were', 'mining', 'as', 'well', 'came', 'alien', 'hibernation', 'deep', 'underground', 'managed', 'reawaken', 'attacked', 'crew.Of', 'course', 'now', 'alien', 'new', 'set', 'hosts', 'gorge', 'survivors', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'who', 'infected', 'who', ""n't"", 'are', 'few', 'twists', 'movie', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'type', 'mean', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1995', 'mean', 'can', 'sort', 'see', 'movie', 'really', 'just', 'amalgam', '34', 'Leviathan', '34', '1989', '34', 'Thing', '34', '1982', '34', 'Alien', '34', '1979/1986.It', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'greatest', 'still', 'are', 'few', 'twists', 'here', 'there', 'made', 'enjoyable', 'can', 'get', 'obvious', 'plot', 'points', 'taken', 'other', 'better', 'know', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', '80s', '90s']",Unknown Origin
809309,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0001KNHQI,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Unknown Origin (Scott P. Levy, 1995)I watched Unknown Origin immediately after finishing the excellently stupid Irish monster movie Grabbers, which in no small part redeemed itself because at no point did it ever take itself seriously. It's not the most original movie in the world, but it celebrates that fact. Unknown Origin gets everything wrong that Grabbers got right; it is an obvious, painful ripoff of the much-superior The Thing (the '82 Carpenter remix) and Alien, but never even nods in their directions. Worse, it takes itself as seriously as cancer. This movie probably had ten times Grabbers' budget, but I've no idea where it went; it looks like it was made for three cases of beer and ten bucks on borrowed equipment and stock that had been thrown away for being years past its expiration date. If the actors worked for scale, the production company should sue them for fraud. As for Scott Levy (whose next feature was another rip-off of exactly this sort called Piranhas)? Somehow, he got away with it, and kept directing all the way up until the dawn of the new millennium. I am reasonably certain that if I never see another Scott Levy film, my life will be much the better for it.Unknown Origin, also released under the more-obvious-ripoff title The Alien Within, centers around an undersea mining city overseen by Jedidiah Pickett (Pretty Woman's Alex Hyde-White), who looks like the kind of guy who would rather be out in the action than administering things from behind a desk. They receive a distress call from another of the company's undersea mining rigs, and Pickett, along with the city's doctor, Henry Lazarus (The Poseidon Adventure's Roddy McDowall, slumming it) and a couple of other crew members, head for the other city. They discover it has been torn to shreds. The only survivor is out of his mind and has to be sedated. At least, they thinkhe's the only survivor, but if you've seen The Thing, you know he's not, and soon the crew are getting paranoid around one another and trying to devise a test to discover who's infected and who isn't.I spent half this movie laughing at it and the other half of it wondering how in the flying Poughkeepsie the casting director convinced Roddy McDowall that he needed to appear in this monstrosity. Blackmail may have been involved. He is, as usual, a slight bright spot in the otherwise ridiculous proceedings, but let's face it&#8212;this is a seventy-five minute movie where seventy-three minutes could have easily been (and should have easily been) left on the cutting-room floor. A couple of clips of McDowell pontificating and a couple others of Sha-Ri Pendleton glowering would have been all that survived, and it would have been better than this.
