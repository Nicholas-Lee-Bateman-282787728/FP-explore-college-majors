373935,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6303427472,Acute Observer,"[3, 3]","This film is set in Las Vegas, a city dependent on tourism and gambling. With this foundation you can imagine the people it attracts. A man leaves a gambling casino with a small suitcase and hails a cab. Pursuers in another car chase this cab. After it crashes the man is struck by this car and killed. The pursuers do not retrieve the suitcase he carried! The cab driver leaves and takes the suitcase: it is filled with a million dollars in hundred-dollar bills. [That would weight about 32 lbs (14.5kg) and would not be as easily carried as shown in this film.]The pursuers figure out the cabbie took the money. The casino manager hires a collector to get it back. This collector displays the identification of a Las Vegas police officer. He's not afraid of a mugger! The cabbie buys a train ticket but is easily tracked, even when he changes his destination to Los Angeles. Another collector picks him up in a taxicab, and takes him to a safe house. There is a scene of gratuitous torture. A miracle occurs, and Jimmy escapes. He winds up in a hospital for his wounds. Nobody looks inside the large bag he carried! [Believable?] A nurse  tries to help him and gets entangled. [Believable?] There is a sideshow dealing with disloyal employees. The two collectors join forces. One is eliminated and Jimmy escapes to the cellar (no exit!). The fight results in an unexpected ending. Jimmy and the nurse discard the collectors [in a method that will attract a lot of attention!], and are last seen buying a ticket for Rio de Janeiro. While there is no extradition treaty, certain forces have the connections there to accomplish their revenge. Again, nobody looks inside the suitcase. [Believable?] The fact is that Customs searches both incoming and outgoing baggage. It is a crime to take out more than $10,000 without declaring it. All in all, it is an action movie that won't strain your brain.",3,Amorality Play,1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,1896,"['film', 'set', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'city', 'dependent', 'tourism', 'gambling', 'foundation', 'can', 'imagine', 'people', 'man', 'gambling', 'casino', 'small', 'suitcase', 'cab', 'Pursuers', 'car', 'chase', 'cab', 'man', 'struck', 'car', 'killed', 'pursuers', 'do', 'not', 'retrieve', 'suitcase', 'carried', 'cab', 'driver', 'leaves', 'suitcase', 'filled', 'million', 'dollars', 'hundred-dollar', 'bills', '[', 'would', 'weight', '32', 'lbs', '14.5kg', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'easily', 'carried', 'shown', 'film', ']', 'pursuers', 'figure', 'out', 'cabbie', 'took', 'money', 'casino', 'manager', 'collector', 'get', 'back', 'collector', 'identification', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'police', 'officer', 'not', 'afraid', 'mugger', 'cabbie', 'train', 'ticket', 'easily', 'tracked', 'even', 'when', 'destination', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'collector', 'up', 'taxicab', 'safe', 'house', 'scene', 'gratuitous', 'torture', 'miracle', 'Jimmy', 'escapes', 'up', 'hospital', 'wounds', 'Nobody', 'large', 'bag', 'carried', '[', 'Believable', ']', 'nurse', 'tries', 'help', 'entangled', '[', 'Believable', ']', 'sideshow', 'dealing', 'disloyal', 'employees', 'two', 'collectors', 'join', 'forces', 'One', 'eliminated', 'Jimmy', 'cellar', 'exit', 'fight', 'results', 'unexpected', 'ending', 'Jimmy', 'nurse', 'discard', 'collectors', '[', 'method', 'will', 'attract', 'lot', 'attention', ']', 'are', 'last', 'seen', 'buying', 'ticket', 'Rio', 'Janeiro', 'extradition', 'treaty', 'certain', 'forces', 'have', 'connections', 'there', 'accomplish', 'revenge', 'Again', 'nobody', 'suitcase', 'Believable', ']', 'fact', 'Customs', 'incoming', 'outgoing', 'baggage', 'crime', 'take', 'out', 'more', '10,000', 'declaring', 'action', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'strain', 'brain']",Night of the Running Man VHS
373936,A89MGH1RHEOQN,6303427472,Adam Paul Bailey,"[10, 12]","This movie is great and I was very lucky to pick it up at the local video store for only a dollar. Good copy too.Andrew McCarthy plays a cabdriver who picks up a passenger who has a million dollars in his suitcase. Pretty soon they are involved in a car chase and the passenger is dead. McCarthy takes the money, saying later that he didn't even want it (yeah right, who wouldn't want a million dollars?). He leaves town and has a hitman on his trail who wants to get the money back to his boss and ofcourse he is also hired to kill him, regardless of how many times he tells him he doesn't have to, I think he fully intends on killing him.One bad mistake that McCarthy made which put Scott Glenn, the hitman onto him was telling this waitress at a diner where he was going so the hitman could force the truth out of her later on. McCarthy tells her he is going to Salt Lake City on the train. Now the killer knows where he is going. McCarthy should have lied and the hitman could have chosen any other station stops at random and possibly have picked the wrong one.Later the hitman's affiliate kidnaps McCarthy and so he won't run off, he boils his feet in hot water, a scene that really stands out in this movie.Amazingly enough, the hitman's helper lets his guard down and falls asleep. When he wakes up he is hit on the head by a dumbbell from McCarthy and gets knocked unconscious. McCarthy goes to hospital and the hitman is always on his tail. Eventually a nurse and him leave the hospital, fall in love etc.Later when Glenn catches up with them, he kills his helper, who once asked how did the hitman think it would go if they had a gunfight. Glenn answers very  quickly.It is a happy ending for McCarthy and his girlfriend although in real life I am not so sure it would work out this way. McCarthy gets lucky and nails the hitman in the head-literally.This film has a lot of adventure and is a great film if you like films about hitmen chasing their victims.",5,run to rent or buy this one,1047168000,"03 9, 2003",2003,1968,"['movie', 'great', 'was', 'very', 'lucky', 'pick', 'up', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'only', 'dollar', 'Good', 'copy', 'too.Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'cabdriver', 'who', 'up', 'passenger', 'who', 'million', 'dollars', 'suitcase', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'are', 'involved', 'car', 'chase', 'passenger', 'dead', 'McCarthy', 'money', 'saying', 'later', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'right', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'million', 'dollars', 'town', 'hitman', 'trail', 'who', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'boss', 'ofcourse', 'also', 'hired', 'kill', 'regardless', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""n't"", 'have', 'think', 'fully', 'killing', 'him.One', 'bad', 'mistake', 'McCarthy', 'made', 'put', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'hitman', 'was', 'telling', 'waitress', 'diner', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'so', 'hitman', 'could', 'force', 'truth', 'later', 'McCarthy', 'going', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'train', 'Now', 'killer', 'where', 'going', 'McCarthy', 'should', 'have', 'lied', 'hitman', 'could', 'have', 'chosen', 'other', 'station', 'stops', 'random', 'possibly', 'have', 'picked', 'wrong', 'one.Later', 'hitman', 'affiliate', 'kidnaps', 'McCarthy', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'run', 'off', 'feet', 'hot', 'water', 'scene', 'really', 'out', 'movie.Amazingly', 'enough', 'hitman', 'helper', 'guard', 'down', 'asleep', 'When', 'up', 'hit', 'head', 'dumbbell', 'McCarthy', 'knocked', 'unconscious', 'McCarthy', 'hospital', 'hitman', 'always', 'tail', 'Eventually', 'nurse', 'leave', 'hospital', 'fall', 'love', 'etc.Later', 'when', 'Glenn', 'up', 'helper', 'who', 'once', 'asked', 'how', 'did', 'hitman', 'think', 'would', 'go', 'had', 'gunfight', 'Glenn', 'answers', 'very', 'quickly.It', 'happy', 'ending', 'McCarthy', 'girlfriend', 'real', 'life', 'am', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'would', 'work', 'out', 'way', 'McCarthy', 'lucky', 'hitman', 'head-literally.This', 'film', 'lot', 'adventure', 'great', 'film', 'like', 'films', 'hitmen', 'chasing', 'victims']",Night of the Running Man VHS

373938,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6303427472,Craig Connell,"[1, 2]","Ah, here's another somewhat bizarre crime film that few people have heard about and, as of today (March, 2009), still is not available on DVD. It is one of the fastest-moving films I've seen.This is a notch above the average low-life criminals affair because of the performances of Scott Glenn and John Glover. They play cold-blooded professional killers who act polite, have impressive vocabularies, dress with class, keep their cool, don't get loud and obnoxious....but are brutally sadistic. Both are also fascinating to watch with Glenn having the bigger role as the main hired killer and Glover as his friend in another city.I might be overrating this a bit because the last 45 minutes is a stretch, a real stretch, beginning with the entrance of a beautiful nurse who unrealistically gets involved with Andrew McCarthy, a guy on the run from these killers. That just wouldn't happen, but it does keep the story going strong.There are some memorable scenes in this movie and some of them not too pleasant, so be forewarned: it can be tough to watch. There are two gratuitous sex scenes in here, too.At any rate, for a no-name movie, it was surprisingly entertaining and I'd love to see someone finally put this out on a Region 1 DVD.
