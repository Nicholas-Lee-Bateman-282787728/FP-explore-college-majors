This is the worst horror movie I have ever seen in all my entire life.  And there have been quite a few.  The acting is bad.  The gore effects are bad.  The very storyline itself is beyond bad.  Editing is even bad.  The people that created this monster of a movie just didn't know what they were doing.  I just dont know how to corelate words to convey the horror that is this film.

They are the easiest to do and also the ones that are usually terrible and completely unorigional. This is an example of the worst of the worst. It takes the basic slaher premise... a group of fun loving adult-teens go on a road trip only to be stalked and picked off by a ""hidden"" killer. There are the token victims and in this films case, there is no fun trying to determine who will live and who will die because once any of the characters spoke, it was EXTREEMLY evident what their fate would be. So, our dim-witted future-victims go to a camp site and despite learning there was a murder there the night before stay there to ""continue"" with the fun as planned. They even befriend a young woman at the camp site (all the alarms should have gone off... someone else in a campsite where a murder went down... hmmmm) and chill with each other by a fire as they talk and ramble about stuff a script couldn't have even improved upon. Each and every actor was gratingly off... and not a single one of them did not get on my nerves. As I watched them speak, I wondered where these card board cut outs who only appeared human like came from. So, when they were finaly dispatched, I felt little pity and maybe a little satisfaction. Of course, it was not enough that this movie had horrible actors and a weak suspensless plot... it also had a killer who was down-right unbelievable. I mean, yes... I guessed who it was the minute the character made the appearance, but that aside there was no real way this person would be ""Strong"" enough to pull off some of the kills they did. Which brings me to the only pro out of this turd on wheels slasher flick. There were a couple of kills that were actually pretty decent. The one in the tent involving a tree, machette, and twine was quite unexpected. Taht said, the kills hardly redeem this flop of a horror film and there really is no reason to watch it... not even at a ""horror movie aprty"" night where everyone gets drunk and makes fun of the movie. Oh no... this film would only serve as the sobering last act...",1,Seriously.

On their way to the camp site they are told of a story about how the area would be secluded due to killings the previous night.  (From here I was already let down!) Throughout the movie, there were many phony ""hints"" worked into the plot as to who was the killer.  After about an hour of very cheesy diolauge and VERY fake gore scenes, the killers are revealed.  The funny thing is, it ended up there were two killers.  The relationship between the killers was never specified. This to me did not make any sense.  Two killers causing all of this so called ""mayhem"", and still the audience has no idea how they connect. Wow. Also, throughout the movie these white captions popped up on the screen for EVERY word said, this was also VERY VERY annoying.Pro's Of The Movie:It's cheap factor had me laughing. I don't know if that's necessarily a good thing, however.Cons Of The Movie:Cheesy diolauge, Idealstic plot, Very very fake gore scenes, and not to mention, rather annoying, there is a character in the movie much like a slim shady wanna be making stupid comments the whole time. Nothing is more annoying than a white boy with a chain using the ""N"" word every other second. At other times I thought I had rented a porn.  Several topless sexual in nature scenes have lead me to this statement.Overall, I could have done better with a video camera phone shooting this movie.  It was sort of funny I guess, but it was supposed to be scary. It was funny in the way that I seriously have NO IDEA how this movie ever made it out of a cheap hifi 8 camcorder.

Sometimes it might be a rich chewy caramel, and other times it might be one of those nasty fruits.  Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised by Motor Home Massacre which is a campy throwback to the slasher films of the 1980's.  And isn't it scary that were now looking at slasher films of the 1980's with a nostalgic eye?  It's a low budget film but the filmmakers at least seem to know this and don't take themselves too seriously.  The plot is standard fare:  A group of good looking friends packs up an RV and heads out to the woods for a good time, only to encounter a goggle-wearing ( I kid you not) psycho bent on busting up the party.Yes the acting is quite Amateurish, especially on the part of the women.  It's pretty clear most of them are along for the ride because they are very hot and show some skin and have fantastic bodies.  Certainly Motor Home Massacre gets an ""A"" when it comes to having a hot female cast.  Shan Holleman as the female lead Sabrina is quite attractive and does an OK job, as does Tanya Fraser as Nicole.  The rest of the females are pretty much just eye-candy.  It's a fairly action-packed slasher with decent special effects and decent gore along with some pretty inventive kills.  I'd say the cast and crew had a pretty good time making the film.  Technically it's OK.  The music is pretty uneven and there are spots when it's a bit too dark but all in all, you can do much worse for a recent slasher film than Motor Home Massacre.",4,A CAMPY THROW BACK TO 80'S SLASHER FILMS,1146614400,"05 3, 2006",2006,1604,"['can', 'paraphrase', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'Films', 'are', 'box', 'chocolates', 'really', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'Sometimes', 'might', 'be', 'rich', 'chewy', 'caramel', 'other', 'times', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'nasty', 'fruits', 'Thankfully', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Motor', 'Home', 'Massacre', 'campy', 'throwback', 'slasher', 'films', '1980', ""n't"", 'scary', 'were', 'now', 'looking', 'slasher', 'films', '1980', 'nostalgic', 'eye', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'least', 'seem', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'plot', 'standard', 'fare', 'group', 'good', 'looking', 'friends', 'up', 'RV', 'out', 'woods', 'good', 'time', 'only', 'encounter', 'goggle-wearing', 'kid', 'not', 'psycho', 'bent', 'busting', 'up', 'party.Yes', 'acting', 'quite', 'Amateurish', 'especially', 'part', 'women', 'pretty', 'clear', 'most', 'are', 'along', 'ride', 'are', 'very', 'hot', 'show', 'skin', 'have', 'fantastic', 'bodies', 'Certainly', 'Motor', 'Home', 'Massacre', 'A', 'when', 'having', 'hot', 'female', 'cast', 'Shan', 'Holleman', 'female', 'lead', 'Sabrina', 'quite', 'attractive', 'OK', 'job', 'Tanya', 'Fraser', 'Nicole', 'rest', 'females', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'eye-candy', 'fairly', 'action-packed', 'slasher', 'decent', 'special', 'effects', 'decent', 'gore', 'pretty', 'inventive', 'kills', ""'d"", 'say', 'cast', 'crew', 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'time', 'making', 'film', 'Technically', 'OK', 'music', 'pretty', 'uneven', 'are', 'spots', 'when', 'bit', 'too', 'dark', 'can', 'do', 'much', 'worse', 'recent', 'slasher', 'film', 'Motor', 'Home', 'Massacre']",Motor Home Massacre
