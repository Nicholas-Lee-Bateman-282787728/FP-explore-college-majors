Hot Dog VendorJustin PeroffMandy Lee Jones ... Teenager in HeavenThe plot is exactly the same as the old movie, Heaven Can Wait, starring Warren Beatty, and first released as Here Comes Mr. Jordan.  The latter two films, however, were played rather straight, without the humor in Down to Earth.  There are differendes, too.  Instead of a death-defying wish to be a quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams, like Joe Pendleton (Warren Beatty) in Heaven Can Wait, His counterpart in Down to Earth, Lance Barton (Chris Rock) is a black comedian who wants to play in the old Apollo theater before it is closed.Like Pendleton, he is temporarily issued the body of a millionaire, or perhaps a billionaire, until another more suited to his talents can be found.This movie has some hillarious ramifications, and is truly entertaining.  Like Joe Pendelton, Lance falls in love in his temporary body, which presents a problem since he is not allowed to keep that identity, but must 'move on' when a more permanent body is found for him.This movie is filled with comedy, when his aged white host acts like a hip black comedian.

583739,A1SCD2NYTIAQTY,B00005JH9O,Mouldy Pilgrim,"[0, 0]","I have to agree with another reviewer and confess that ""Down to Earth"" is definitely not Chris Rock's best movie. He was much funnier and much better in many other movies, though I would not level the degree of criticism at ""Down to Earth"" that others have.First off, the plot is pretty thin, not to mention the fact that it has been flogged like a dead horse even before this movie came out. With some thin changes, the plot still comes of a bit on the weak side. Basically, a well meaning, but failing comedian gets snuffed ten seconds before his impending death on the front of a moving truck. Due to the Angel of Death's merciful mistake, the comedian gets reincarnted into another body: rich, aging, white guy. The antics of this major shift in perspective supply the majority of the gags, some of which are amusing, but hardly gut-wrenching.This movie is nothing if not predictable, and there are some famous faces whose talents are pretty much squandered in it. After all, it is a romantic comedy, and there is not much to be expected in surprises. In some places, it just comes off as corny, but it does not negatively impact on the movie overall. In the end, one would not choose this for its ""surprise factor"" and major plot twists.The humour itself is pretty weak over all, but generally is worth a giggle or two in places. The shock of Charles Wellington coming back to life after his wife and executive killed him was pretty cool as a scene. While none of the humour was really enough to bring tears to the eyes, it was not all that bad. Amusing, but not much more.All in all, ""Down to Earth"" is a predictable, safe and amusing romantic comedy. I don't think there are any illusions to greatness here, and it makes a nice little movie to sit down and zone out to. I had a small giggle, but I would not recommend buying it.

I was glad to see my first impression was wrong. Down to Earth is a wonderful romantic comedy. Chris Rock does what he does best, keep it funny. He has chemistry with all the characters including Eugene Levy, Chazz Pa(? ) and Regina King.Lance ( Rock ) is a struggling comedian finally winning his chance to become something great. His life is ended when he's confronted by a lovely vision ( Regina King )while riding his bike. Little does Lance know his number is up and Keys ( Eugene Levy ) is the messenger that takes him up to heaven.  Lance is given the option of returning back to earth as a rich white man. The fault with this is that when Lance becomes Charles Wellington, he doesn't KNOW anything about Charles. But shouldn't he know everything if he has BECOME Charles? I guess the filmmakers didn't see the slip-up. Once Lance claimed the body he would have automatically become the dead guy. So why was it he didn't know anything about...himself? Anyway, Charles is a "" bastard "" to hear Sontee Jenkins tell it. Sontee ( Regina King ) has stolen Lance's heart and the only way he can woo her is through Charles' body. That's when the fun really begins. As predicted, Lance slowly charms Sontee until she falls for him. He also ends up with a shot at playing the Apollo. Everything is where it should be and his life has never been better, except that ( it isn't his life is it?). By the time Lance gets in the true groove of being Charles, the angels find another body. Lance tries to allude them so he can keep Sontee and his newfound good fortune but it all comes to an end. But as all romantic comedies go, Lance ends up getting the girl in an entirely different form.This was predictable at times. It's a remake of Heaven Can Wait with Warren Beatty. We KNEW Lance would get the girl. We KNEW his dreams would come true. The major faults were stereotypical jokes and behavior against blacks. It wasn't a big deal in this particular film, but it was there and it wasn't needed. This film relies heavily on the differences between the black and white cultures. It does move the film along, but it gets tiresome after the fourth "" see-how-we're-different "" joke.The actors give convincing performances. Rock is not my first choice for a romantic lead, but he IS the funniest man in America and he was the hottest comedian in 2001. There is no question why Rock was awarded this film deal.  Regina King puts in another great performance.  Down to Earth is entertaining but would have been even better with a stronger male lead.

Some of the new aspects I enjoyed with this remake were the theme of a black man getting a white man's life in his second chance on Earth, the main character's (Chris Rock) life revolving around a career in stand-up comedy and the image of heaven as an exclusive nightclub with an Italian Frank Sinatra wannabe as the boss.If you're not familiar with Chris Rock you're missing out.  Rock is one of the best comedians today but the entire cast gives a wonderful performance with great supporting roles such as Wanda Sykes in the role of a bitter and stubborn maid.  &quot;Down to Earth&quot; mixes in a nice romantic tale that leaves you with a happy ending and enjoyable cinema experience.  The only negative comment I have about the movie is the short length.  The movie lasts 87 minute and seems to end quickly but perhaps thats because it's also a good and deep enough film that you wish it would go on.In DVD version, the movie is a disappointment.  The only additional options included (besides audio setup and scene selection) are a theatrical trailer and a ten minute &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; clip that resembles something you would see on HBO.  Considering the DVD price, if you don't have an objection towards mixing your DVD collection with VHS movies, I'd recommend this movie on VHS if you can find a bargain price for it.

Chris Rock, in probably the best of his work that I've ever seen, plays Lance Barton, a struggling comedian who is suddenly hit by a truck and killed.  The reason for his death is due to a screw-up by his guardian angel, a newbe played by Eugene Levy.  Because of this snafu, the angels are willing to help Barton return to Earth, first finding a ""loaner"" body for him to temporarily occupy while they find a more permanent solution.  So Barton takes on the role of millionaire Charles Wellington III.  But he quickly inputs his own ideas and changes the grim, money-making-at-all-costs outlook that the elderly white man was previously known for.  Again, a fine job all around.  Apart from Chris Rock, who shined from beginning to end, great performances were given by Frankie Faison, Eugene Levy, Regina King, Chazz Palminteri, Jennifer Coolidge and many others.  It's a film I've watched and liked multiple times.  Sure, some of the jokes could be better, but the plot and the cast do make up for that quite nicely.  A solid five stars for this one.

In the meantime, he's got big dreams to pursue on Earth, such as landing a slot at the final Amateur Night Contest at the famed Apollo Theatre. Lance's has one little problem though, he ain't that funny. Thanks to an over-cautious emissary from heaven, Mr. Keyes, he's going to get hit literally with a much bigger problem.
