855383,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,B00061QJH6,John D. Cofield,"[10, 10]","The 3rd and 4th series of Rumpole of the Bailey continue and improve on the fine tradition established by the first two series. Leo McKern remains utterly magnificent as the intrepid barrister who never pleads Guilty (although he does break that tradition once), the scourge of the pompous and the pettifoggers of his chambers at Equity Court in the Temple and in the courtrooms of the Old Bailey.  He tackles a series of cases, many of them outside of London in various rural locales, and once at a military base in Germany.  Whatever his milieu, Rumpole is always master of the situation.These  series have a larger number of women characters than the first two. Besides Phillida Trant Erskine-Brown, Rumpole's chambers also boast two female barristers-in-training:  Fiona Allways, an upper-crust sort who seeks out Rumpole when her sister badly needs assistance; and my favorite among the minor characters, Liz Probert, the brilliant daughter of a left-wing Labour Party leader who joins Rumpole in championing the poor and oppressed (although they have considerably different views as to what sorts of people are included in that category.)  There is also Hilda ""She Who Must Be Obeyed"" Rumpole, who is played by a different actress starting in the 4th series, but who remains as indomitable as ever.There are some old favorites among the minor characters like Claude Erskine-Brown and the petty-thieving Timson clan.  Guthrie Featherstone is now a judge, but he has been replaced as Head of chambers by ""Soapy Sam"" Ballard, a  highly religious and insufferable twit who is a perfect foil for Rumpole.Although these stories were filmed in the 1980s they remain fresh and funny, a breath of air tinged with the smoke of Rumpole's old cheroots and a splash of Chateau Thames Embankment.",5,Rumpole Improves With Age,1113350400,"04 13, 2005",2005,1788,"['3rd', '4th', 'series', 'Rumpole', 'Bailey', 'continue', 'improve', 'fine', 'tradition', 'established', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'utterly', 'magnificent', 'intrepid', 'barrister', 'who', 'never', 'Guilty', 'break', 'tradition', 'once', 'scourge', 'pompous', 'pettifoggers', 'chambers', 'Equity', 'Court', 'Temple', 'courtrooms', 'Old', 'Bailey', 'series', 'cases', 'many', 'London', 'various', 'rural', 'locales', 'once', 'military', 'base', 'Germany', 'Whatever', 'milieu', 'Rumpole', 'always', 'master', 'situation.These', 'series', 'have', 'larger', 'number', 'women', 'characters', 'first', 'two', 'Phillida', 'Trant', 'Erskine-Brown', 'Rumpole', 'chambers', 'also', 'boast', 'two', 'female', 'barristers-in-training', 'Fiona', 'Allways', 'upper-crust', 'sort', 'who', 'out', 'Rumpole', 'when', 'sister', 'badly', 'assistance', 'favorite', 'minor', 'characters', 'Liz', 'Probert', 'brilliant', 'daughter', 'left-wing', 'Labour', 'Party', 'leader', 'who', 'Rumpole', 'championing', 'poor', 'oppressed', 'have', 'considerably', 'different', 'views', 'what', 'sorts', 'people', 'are', 'included', 'category', 'also', 'Hilda', 'Who', 'Must', 'Be', 'Obeyed', 'Rumpole', 'who', 'played', 'different', 'actress', 'starting', '4th', 'series', 'who', 'as', 'indomitable', 'are', 'old', 'favorites', 'minor', 'characters', 'Claude', 'Erskine-Brown', 'petty-thieving', 'Timson', 'clan', 'Guthrie', 'Featherstone', 'now', 'judge', 'been', 'replaced', 'Head', 'chambers', 'Soapy', 'Sam', 'Ballard', 'highly', 'religious', 'insufferable', 'twit', 'who', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Rumpole.Although', 'stories', 'were', 'filmed', '1980s', 'remain', 'fresh', 'funny', 'breath', 'air', 'tinged', 'smoke', 'Rumpole', 'old', 'cheroots', 'splash', 'Chateau', 'Thames', 'Embankment']",N/A

Martin,"[24, 25]","If you saw at least some of the series and you wonder if a set is worth springing for, I think it is.Leo McKern is unfailingly perfect as the idealistic libertarian tempered by a weathered cynicism of legal and government machinations. The other actors are usually quite good, though the roles are somtimes a bit caricaturish. In a sense, though, the caricatures are apt since they reveal attorneys and judges as priggish hypocrites they so commonly are. Rumpole recognizes that we are victims of these fools that he suffers not so gladly. Unlike most people, he is neither snowed by nor kowtows to the pretensions of the the legal system. He does, though, care a great deal about the ideals of justice that are given little more than lip service in reality.The stories are not brilliant, but they are consistent and sufficiently good to showcase McKern. There are two reasons I've bought the DVDs. The first is McKern, and the second is a sense of civility one experiences watching Rumpole. TV is so relentlessly moronic that one gasps for the fresh air that a series like this affords. It's striking how TV content -- including that provided on so-called public television -- has deteriorated since Rumpole first ran. Long gone are the days of I, Claudius, The Singing Detective, and Sherlock Holmes. Now the offerings of Masterpiece Theater and Mystery! are often embarassingly bad.
