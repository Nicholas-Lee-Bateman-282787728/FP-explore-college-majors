Great script.  Superb performances.  Until recently, it cost $175 to buy a copy so as soon as I saw it for less than $10 I jumped on it.  Will send it to other friends in upcoming months.  If you love John Astin, you will love ERS.  Haven't ever see the Brothers O'Toole and am looking forward to it.  If you don't get anything else out of this review, IT IS HILARIOUS.  Buy it.
