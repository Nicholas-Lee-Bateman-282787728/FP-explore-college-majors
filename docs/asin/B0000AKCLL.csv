The writers use the Jersey Devil as the antagonist for the film and they do play around with the legend some.  For a low budget film there are some very good production values.  Many low budget direct to video films either rely heavily on CGI or look like a director's home movie.  This movie has several seasoned actors and some new ones.  The acting from the veterans is believable and the new actors do a good job.I don't understand all the bad reviews for this movie.  Yeah, it has some clich&eacute;s and they do change some things for the sake of drama, but this movie is very watchable.  It's obviously a low budget film, but the production crew did a lot with the little they had.  I also don't understand why so many reviewers found the movie confusing.

764027,A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,B0000AKCLL,Draconis Blackthorne,"[1, 1]","Briefly, the legend of The Jersey Devil is quite an interesting one, going back some 260 years. A demonic entity supposedly appears before some impending disaster to unsuspecting folk in the enchanted pine barrens area of New Jersey. Its origins stem from a mother who cursed her child by proclaiming that The Devil could take it - in consequence, a devilish child with horns, wings, tail,  and cloven hooves issued from her loins and took to flight, thus beginning this urban legend. There are several other variations, including a really interesting one about its mother being a witch, and The Devil, its father. Older pIctures drawn by purported 'witnesses' describe a very Baphomet-looking creature, as well as a sort of horse-demon synthesis.The Pine Barrens are a natural environment overgrown with wonderful foliage, swamps, and residences transcending modern civilation. Such wildly lush locations tend to breed folktales because of these seeming opposing conditions to the 'big city', thus rendering them intriguing and mysterious places, as well as the residents themselves propagating continual superstition.In this cinematic adaptation, an investigator named ""Kathryn"" {Michelle Maryk} is assigned to follow up the apparent murder of a redneck hunter who just so happened to be listening to a decidedly ""Coast to Coast""-sounding program on the radio, before being attacked by a red-eyed creature, apparently attracted by the carcass of a deer hooked onto his truck, which was to be the hick's dinner. Apparently, he became the main course!Kathryn meets up with a law-enforcement acquaintance {although a more personal relationship is suggested}, subsequently finding a large black 'tooth', along with the mutilated torso of the hunter, and take it to be examined at the Coroner's office - predictably, it turns out that there is no matching DNA with the relic, but instead seems to be a composit of a goat's, bat's, and something else they cannot identify.She eventually meets with a ""Mr. Shroud"" {Cliff Robertson} - a charming and enigmatic gentleman with many remarkable de-facto Satanic qualities, from his appearence, demeanor, to even his total environment. He graciously offers her a stay for the night, and over pleasant dinner conversation, reveals his agreeable misanthropy.During the course of the investigation, Mr. Shroud's deadly 'secret' is discovered, but even through some difficulty, manages to preserve his Magical and timeless existence.As a humorous aside, a scene wherein a bumpkin couple drive around seeking a spot to copulate, find an abandoned trailer in the woods, where they are frightened by some hillbillies, and are sent scampering back to the car, eventually being stopped by the Police in a half-naked hysteria.In a seemingly gratuitous element of the plot, a mental patient named 'Riley' {Robert Guillaume} recounts his experience with The Jersey Devil, and holds onto a talisman to protect him and keep him alive. His eventual misbehavior lands him in solitary confinement where he eventually receives a visit from the creature, who takes his due.On a visual basis, I did like the appearence of the Jersey Devil monster itself, very demonic with horns, wings, hooves, and Giger-like alieneque jaws.The 13th Child is a dramatic take on the urban legend, incorperating some blood and gore similar to 'Jeepers Creepers', although there are no accounts of The Jersey Devil actually killing anyone, so astistic license was taken for this presentation.

How in the world do you take such an old & creepy legend that countless locals still believe in & manage to somehow screw it up? Being from jersey devil land I was kind of insulted. I grew up with these extemely spooky stories that made me, my cousins & friends never venture into the Pine Barrens at night & we would often get creeped out even during day light hours. I really don't know where to begin? First off, me nor any of my friends or family ever heard the so called tale that they tried to pass off in the film? I have no idea what the thinking was there so the film held no truth what so ever, except for the mere fact that it was a real legend thats been passed down for many generations.Yes....I'm well aware that this was just a movie & I'm quite familiar with the Hollywood way, but this was supposed to based entirely on the real legend & nothing could have been further from the truth. The very simple premise of the real story could have easily been another Blair Witch Project or at least another Wendigo, which was a far better take on the jersey devil, even though that film was based on a true Native American legend unlike this movie & done extemely well in my opinion. Besides, the stupidly fabricated story of the 13th Child being a complete crock, they over loaded the movie with terrible special effects that made no sense & the creature looked like a really bad copy of an H.R. Gieger alien.Just horrible. If....... they had to show a clear shot of the creature, the creature in the Wendigo would have been a hundred times better. The only things mildly watchable were some cool shots of NJ & the Pine Barrens & go figure?, there is a good documentary included on the special features, which interviewed some true residents & writers of the region . I'm certain that those poor people are ashamed of being included on the same disk as the ""movie"" Other than these few things it was very poorly done & I can't help but think that anybody from the area could have done a much better job. All that they had to do was follow the true stories that the real locals told & that would have been more than enough to make a great horror film, that could have been a classic. I truly hope that some director out there makes a new movie that does this scarey legend justice.  Worth seeing? If......... you can get it REALLY CHEAP, I'd say check it out, for the documentary, but DO NOT spend more than five dollars. Only the documentary merrits the second star.If you're interested in spookey movies that are based on actual fact check out the fore mentioned Wendigo, The Mothman Phrophecies & The Legend of Boggy Creek (highly debated as fact of fiction, but great)& for flat out fiction....... Session 9 & The Blair Witch Project were sheer genious & very entertaining.

I did, however, learn two things. (A) Uncle Ben has relinquished his benevolent role in Spider-Man to pursue his evil secret career as an anecdotal alchemist somewhere deep at the heart of the Pine Barrens. (B) Uncle Ben's pet spider, ""Bruno"", is in fact the Jersey Devil.The movie starts off with Riley in a mental hospital, jabbering about a series of events that no one else believes. Then, the movie flips backwards to a couple of days earlier.Special investigator Kathryn is called in to solve a murder of an escaped convict and his girlfriend and also, just whenever she gets the chance, the legend of the Jersey Devil. Kathryn is joined by fellow investigator Ron and Ron's partner whose name I can't recall. Uncle Ben evidently now travels under the ominous name of Mr. Shroud. He resides at the Shroud Estate, where he tends to his spiders and poison herbs, squatting on land bequeathed to him by an ancient Indian tribe. Kathryn ends up staying the night at the Shroud place, during which she is regaled by Shroud's bizarre rambling diatribe---various pseudo-nihilistic theories on natural selection and predatory nobility; presumably, Shroud thinks he's got a solid shot and he's moving in for the kill with his ""A"" material. Peripherally, Kathryn is also officially introduced to Bruno, while still in his spider mode, of course.Kathryn snoops around and finds an animal talon. This talon is identical to another talon discovered along the shoreline of the river where the convict's mutilated remains were originally recovered. This of course automatically incriminates Shroud. The talons and the victim's mutilated torso are brought to the local autopsy specialist, at which point he roughly compares one of the talons to one of the wounds on the torso and instantly deduces that the talon is in fact the murder weapon. Yes my dear Watson, I believe the game is now afoot!Kathryn ends up in trapped Shroud's barn, with Ron bleeding out on the ground somewhere behind her. She is confronted by Shroud, who immediately disgorges some kind of screwball elliptical explanation for everything. Then Shroud summons Bruno in Jersey Devil mode, a big hairy monster with horns and buckets of saliva. Shroud and Bruno, are, according to Shroud, connected in some undisclosed way.I've seen Bigfoot movies, Nessie movies, Abominable Snowman movies, and they've even got one now about the Bell Witch.

Not only does he appear in the movie, he also co-wrote its incomprehensible and sometimes dull script.The Jersey Devil is one of those local legends that claims to have sustained truth; the movie even includes one local who explains how she saw the devil and drew a picture of it to boot.  The movie takes this legend and weaves a story (somewhat) around it, peopling it with stereotypes and cliches, and asking its audience to accept all kinds of improbabilities and plot holes.  The acting..well, Robertson tries to bring a dignity to his role as Mr. Shroud; Lesley Ann Down and Peter Jason have brief bits as the State DA and coroner, respectively; and poor Robert Guillaume eschews his Benson role in favor of a supposedly wacky former cop who lost his partner to the Devil and knows its ""secret.""  Worst of all is Michelle Maryk as the female lead who suspiciously has the last name of one of the producers; she's awful.  I gave it two stars for a couple of creepy scenes involving the spider and the actual creature, but otherwise, it's nothing new or exciting.

The plot is about a woman who is seeking some mystery of the Jersey Devil. She teams up with people, they have no chemistry, the acting is far from great, the plot is not strong, you don't really know why or how characters tie into the story but you don't care enough to rewind to find out either.The special effects aren't much, the Jersey Devil is portrayed as more a big stupid dumb mongoloid with a mouth ripped right off from Aliens. By the time the things finished, you have no satisfaction about what you just saw. It's far from being one of the worst films of all time, and it isn't exactly boring, but it doesn't pay off in the end and they should have kept the JD more a mystery then revealing what it is and who controls it.To say it's scary? HAHA, no way, maybe for an adolescent afraid of there own shadow. It's one of those cut away, show the blood after it kind of things and add a few loud noises here and there.Honestly, I'm not saying avoid it, but i recommend only watch it if you have nothing better to do or are curious, but don't expect anything out of it but more then something to pass some time watching.I'd would have given it 2 and a half stars but unfortunately it tried to throw in a useless nude scene that was not needed so the desperately depraved perverts out there will take an interest in it. so it gets a 1 and a half from me.",2,The Jersey Flop,1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,1573,"['first', 'heard', 'Jersey', 'Devil', 'legend', 'video', 'called', 'last', 'broadcast', 'when', 'i', 'read', 'back', 'cover', 'was', 'curiosity', 'made', 'rent', 'it.Well', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'only', 'rent', 'plot', 'woman', 'who', 'seeking', 'mystery', 'Jersey', 'Devil', 'teams', 'up', 'people', 'have', 'chemistry', 'acting', 'far', 'great', 'plot', 'not', 'strong', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'why', 'how', 'characters', 'tie', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough', 'rewind', 'find', 'out', 'either.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'Jersey', 'Devil', 'portrayed', 'more', 'big', 'stupid', 'dumb', 'mongoloid', 'mouth', 'ripped', 'right', 'Aliens', 'time', 'things', 'finished', 'have', 'satisfaction', 'what', 'just', 'saw', 'far', 'being', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'time', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'boring', ""n't"", 'pay', 'off', 'end', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'JD', 'more', 'mystery', 'then', 'revealing', 'what', 'who', 'it.To', 'say', 'scary', 'HAHA', 'way', 'maybe', 'adolescent', 'afraid', 'own', 'shadow', 'one', 'cut', 'away', 'show', 'blood', 'kind', 'things', 'add', 'few', 'loud', 'noises', 'here', 'there.Honestly', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'avoid', 'i', 'recommend', 'only', 'watch', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'are', 'curious', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'more', 'then', 'something', 'pass', 'time', 'watching.I', ""'d"", 'would', 'have', 'given', '2', 'half', 'stars', 'unfortunately', 'tried', 'throw', 'useless', 'nude', 'scene', 'was', 'not', 'needed', 'so', 'desperately', 'depraved', 'there', 'will', 'take', 'interest', '1', 'half']",13th Child: Legend of the Jersey Devil

However...let's begin.Actually they got the legend totally wrong, completely.  My sister did an extensive research and practically tore the TV apart when watching what little she did.  It painful to begin with.Not enough could be said about how totally HORRIBLE the actor job was. (sorry, the guy who played the human brother was great) But the actress (can u call her that?) that led made me want to cry.  She can not act at all. At the final sceen she sound so fake like she was hypervitilating. I just couldn't stand it.The effects were ok at the least, like any normal bad horror movie. The really bad thing about the entire ordeal is that this is only vol 1!! I can't imagine any sequel? To sum it up, this was bad, all to say.
