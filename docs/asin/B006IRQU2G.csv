I did the same this time around and enjoyed it just as much as I did back then. Well, almost! It is a little dated (especially with effects) and a little corny at times but it's also a lot of fun. I think I remember reading that this show was filmed during the writers strike and as such they basically re-shot some of the original episodes, but as I never watched the original series it had little effect on me.
