251709,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6301412702,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[62, 63]","Though this film has only a few scraps to offer in the way of scriptural accuracy, it is a visual delight, and one of the very best examples of the lush Technicolor of the mid 20th century, with its deep cobalt blues and incredibly rich reds. The cinematography by Leon Shamroy, along with the massive sets and luxurious costumes (all three were Oscar nominated but lost out to &quot;An American in Paris&quot;) make this a fabulous &quot;sword and sandals&quot; epic; it also boasts a dramatic score by Alfred Newman, and one of my favorite dance sequences on film, by the brilliant Jack Cole. One had to be very strong and athletic to do his choreography, and the dancer in this number is the great Gwen Verdon.Gregory Peck is handsome beyond words as King David, and it's always a pleasure to listen to his resonant voice; his recitation of the 23rd psalm, and his prayer at the Ark of the Covenant, are memorable scenes. In this film David is a pale reflection of the Bible character, this story being more about a big Hollywood romance, and the trouble it gets him in along with his partner in sin Bathsheba, played by the stunning Susan Hayward, who maintains her tiny waistline even though she is supposed to be &quot;with child&quot;.Directed by Henry King, the script and score were also Oscar nominated but lost to &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;.For a film that is faithful to scripture, see the excellent TV production starring Nathaniel Parker, but for simply lavish entertainment, vibrant color and a gorgeous cast, this film is a classic well worth viewing.

251710,A1E0WHE7NDK2S6,6301412702,Angel G. Garcia,"[2, 3]","King David, the hero of Israel, is performed very well by Gregory Peck, who falls in love with Bathsheba ( Susan Hayward ), a beautiful woman married to one of his army captains Uriah ( Kieron Moore ). David decides to send Uriah into a hard battle to get rid of a disturbing husband. This film is the story of a sin and a redemption, though nowadays more than 3000 years later, that sin would not exist, I think, and for this there would not be any reason to send Uriah to battle, besides going to battle was one of the best gifts that a warrior as Uriah could receive.An abandoned married woman Bathsheba lives by King David and at times both of them can see by chance the other one at home, besides Bathsheba has no company, no love and no sex for years, because his busy husband likes to be at the war against the Philistines ( ancient inhabitants of Palestine ), and behaves as if his wife were only a flowerpot. After being a long time at the war front Uriah comes back only for a day and decides to sleep at the barracks of the army instead of staying at home that night with his wife, a big humiliation for his wife indeed!, unfortunately their marriage were settled by their parents. Both David and Bathsheba like each other, so David only wants to get that abandoned flower at his best before it withers. A bit aggresive and superstitious prophet Nathan ( played well by Raymond Massey ) fights for justice and accuses David of living in sin, of causing the destruction ( ?! ) of Israel, and moves the mob to trow stones at Bathsheba, according to law. The ending of the movie is fair and nice, both lovers are forgiven by God's love and can live as a true married couple for ever.The technicolor of the film is wonderful.",4,Love versus circumstances.,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,1732,"['King', 'David', 'hero', 'Israel', 'performed', 'very', 'well', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'who', 'love', 'Bathsheba', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'married', 'one', 'army', 'captains', 'Uriah', 'Kieron', 'Moore', 'David', 'send', 'Uriah', 'hard', 'battle', 'get', 'rid', 'disturbing', 'husband', 'film', 'story', 'sin', 'redemption', 'nowadays', 'more', '3000', 'years', 'later', 'sin', 'would', 'not', 'exist', 'think', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'reason', 'send', 'Uriah', 'battle', 'going', 'battle', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'gifts', 'warrior', 'Uriah', 'could', 'receive.An', 'abandoned', 'married', 'woman', 'Bathsheba', 'King', 'David', 'times', 'can', 'see', 'chance', 'other', 'one', 'home', 'Bathsheba', 'company', 'love', 'sex', 'years', 'busy', 'husband', 'likes', 'be', 'war', 'Philistines', 'ancient', 'inhabitants', 'Palestine', 'behaves', 'wife', 'were', 'only', 'flowerpot', 'being', 'long', 'time', 'war', 'front', 'Uriah', 'back', 'only', 'day', 'decides', 'sleep', 'barracks', 'army', 'instead', 'staying', 'home', 'night', 'wife', 'big', 'humiliation', 'wife', 'indeed', 'unfortunately', 'marriage', 'were', 'settled', 'parents', 'David', 'Bathsheba', 'other', 'so', 'David', 'only', 'get', 'abandoned', 'flower', 'best', 'bit', 'aggresive', 'superstitious', 'prophet', 'Nathan', 'played', 'well', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'fights', 'justice', 'David', 'living', 'sin', 'causing', 'destruction', 'Israel', 'mob', 'trow', 'stones', 'Bathsheba', 'according', 'law', 'ending', 'movie', 'fair', 'nice', 'lovers', 'are', 'forgiven', 'God', 'love', 'can', 'live', 'true', 'married', 'couple', 'ever.The', 'technicolor', 'film', 'wonderful']",N/A

251712,ADES8B01WRPI3,6301412702,"Bryan E. Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[9, 9]","I never heard of this film until I saw it on amazon.com's ""People Who Bought This Also Bought..."" web feature. I am glad I saw it there, it is a very interesting 1950's film starring a very famous Hollywood star, Gregory Peck!DAVID AND BATHSHEBA itself is a little low on action, but it redeems itself by being cram-packed with accurate Bible scenes, and intelligently re-arranged Bible scenes that do not offend the sensibilities of folks who know the actual Bible story well! It is probably more accurate than THE TEN COMMANDMENTS starring Charlton Heston, also from the 1950's, but Heston's film is more fun and more famous. Nevertheless, DAVID AND BATHSHEBA is very good, especially for being a nearly forgotten film that few people seem to know about.Gregory Peck is awesome as the thoughtful King of Israel who strays from God as a mid-life crisis, but pays the price! Peck has the screen presence and intelligence to make an excellent King David during this era of David's life! Susan Hayward is okay as Bathsheba, (but she seems a little too All-American, strawberry blonde, instead of Jewish brunette).The script follows the Bible pretty closely, concerning Bible scenes and characters. There is minor chronological re-arranging, and minor character development details not in the Bible, but throughout the film, the added details enhance the film without contradicting the Bible verses! A lot of the details are so close to accurate that I had to pick up my King James Bible to verify if they had gotten it right or not, and they usually had gotten it right! I even learned that the correct pronounciation is BATHsheba, according to this film and my King James Bible, though I always said bathSHEba! Watch and learn.Absalom is probably too young at times, but scenes with Michal, David's first wife, are NOT in the Bible, but very accurate to Michal's complaining, negative attitude! The guy playing Uriah is great, and very well written. This movie actually helped me to envision Uriah in a different, more detailed way that I think makes perfectly logical sense.The the biggest, worst thing that I saw where they got the Bible wrong is that the last 30 minutes of the film focuses on the people demanding that Bathsheba be stoned for her adultery, and how King David tries to resolve her fate. In the Bible, of course, Bathsheba is NEVER criticized publically or called to be punished by the people. Having said that, the last 30 minutes are also some of the nicest scenes in the film, showing King David reciting Psalm 23, and showing flashbacks of David's childhood, such as slaying Goliath!There is also an interesting b/w feature of an oddity, a promotional piece showing Gregory Peck, Susan Hayward, and the director acting out how Gregory Peck supposedly got hired for this film. My DVD copy stops abrubtly after 3 minutes, mid-verse(!), but hopefully everybody elses will play correctly.If you collect Bible movies, like I do, then this will make a nice addition to your Bible DVD library!",5,"A Bit SLOW at Times, but 90% Bible Accurate, and 10% Bible Rearranged Nicely!",1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,3008,"['never', 'heard', 'film', 'saw', 'amazon.com', 'People', 'Who', 'Bought', 'Also', 'Bought', 'web', 'feature', 'am', 'glad', 'saw', 'there', 'very', 'interesting', '1950', 'film', 'starring', 'very', 'famous', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'DAVID', 'AND', 'BATHSHEBA', 'little', 'low', 'action', 'being', 'cram-packed', 'accurate', 'Bible', 'scenes', 'intelligently', 're-arranged', 'Bible', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'offend', 'sensibilities', 'folks', 'who', 'know', 'actual', 'Bible', 'story', 'well', 'probably', 'more', 'accurate', 'TEN', 'COMMANDMENTS', 'starring', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'also', '1950', 'Heston', 'film', 'more', 'fun', 'more', 'famous', 'Nevertheless', 'DAVID', 'AND', 'BATHSHEBA', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'being', 'nearly', 'forgotten', 'film', 'few', 'people', 'seem', 'know', 'about.Gregory', 'Peck', 'awesome', 'thoughtful', 'King', 'Israel', 'who', 'God', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'price', 'Peck', 'screen', 'presence', 'intelligence', 'make', 'excellent', 'King', 'David', 'era', 'David', 'life', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'okay', 'Bathsheba', 'little', 'too', 'All-American', 'strawberry', 'blonde', 'instead', 'Jewish', 'brunette', 'script', 'Bible', 'pretty', 'closely', 'concerning', 'Bible', 'scenes', 'characters', 'minor', 'chronological', 're-arranging', 'minor', 'character', 'development', 'details', 'not', 'Bible', 'film', 'added', 'details', 'enhance', 'film', 'contradicting', 'Bible', 'verses', 'lot', 'details', 'are', 'so', 'close', 'accurate', 'had', 'pick', 'up', 'King', 'James', 'Bible', 'verify', 'had', 'gotten', 'right', 'not', 'usually', 'had', 'gotten', 'right', 'even', 'learned', 'correct', 'pronounciation', 'BATHsheba', 'according', 'film', 'King', 'James', 'Bible', 'always', 'said', 'bathSHEba', 'Watch', 'learn.Absalom', 'probably', 'too', 'young', 'times', 'scenes', 'Michal', 'David', 'first', 'wife', 'are', 'NOT', 'Bible', 'very', 'accurate', 'Michal', 'complaining', 'negative', 'attitude', 'guy', 'playing', 'Uriah', 'great', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'movie', 'actually', 'helped', 'envision', 'Uriah', 'different', 'more', 'detailed', 'way', 'think', 'perfectly', 'logical', 'sense.The', 'biggest', 'worst', 'thing', 'saw', 'where', 'got', 'Bible', 'wrong', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'people', 'demanding', 'Bathsheba', 'be', 'stoned', 'adultery', 'how', 'King', 'David', 'resolve', 'fate', 'Bible', 'course', 'Bathsheba', 'NEVER', 'criticized', 'publically', 'called', 'be', 'punished', 'people', 'Having', 'said', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'are', 'also', 'nicest', 'scenes', 'film', 'showing', 'King', 'David', 'reciting', 'Psalm', '23', 'showing', 'flashbacks', 'David', 'childhood', 'such', 'slaying', 'Goliath', 'also', 'interesting', 'b/w', 'feature', 'oddity', 'promotional', 'piece', 'showing', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'director', 'acting', 'out', 'how', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'supposedly', 'got', 'hired', 'film', 'DVD', 'copy', 'stops', 'abrubtly', '3', 'minutes', 'mid-verse', 'hopefully', 'everybody', 'elses', 'will', 'play', 'correctly.If', 'collect', 'Bible', 'movies', 'do', 'then', 'will', 'make', 'nice', 'addition', 'Bible', 'DVD', 'library']",N/A

Williams ""gareth37""","[4, 4]","In August 1951, Twentieth Century Fox released David and Bathsheba--a bold, colorful depiction of the fateful love affair between a chosen king and the woman who would bear his successor. Adultery, intrigue, murder and divine judgment play their roles in this biblically based saga.Alfred Newman's musical score is that type of grand orchestration which touches the soul.  Without music, there is no inspiration.Phillip Dune's script gave the movie audiences a fine portrayal of a an aging king who allowed his obsession and passion for a beautiful woman, who was married to one of his bravest and truest warriors, to bring disgrace on his name and divine wrath on Israel.  Like his later scripts (The Robe, The Agony and the Ecstasy...), Dune's focus was on the characters and what made them, what drove them, and what were their inner conflicts. Their moments of joy and moments of sadness, and eventually, their decisions and the effect of those decisions on themselves and those around them were explored in full circle.Raymond Massey's Nathan is a wilderness prophet in the true tradition of Old Testament prophets.  He gave the word of the Lord unequivocally without fear of the consequences.Gregory Peck, with his impeccable voice, and Susan Hayward, with her graceful beauty, gave life to David and Bathsheba on the screen.  From the first moment of their encounter in his chamber to the last scene in his chamber, the story unfolds from forbidden love to forgiveness.  As the rains pour from the heavens to refresh the earth, they refresh David's soul and rekindle the spark of what made him-a man after God's own heart.""In war time the best are always the first to die."" David's words to Uriah were fortuitous.David had Joab sacrifice Uriah in order to cover his own sins against his God and his fellow man.  Uriah would have died for David without hesitation. However, to take Uriah's life in order to have his wife was a crime which David the shepherd boy would never had done.  However, the king whom David had become had no hesitation in making it happen.The theme in this film is that David the king rediscovers David the shepherd boy and his faith in God.

It is a love that is doomed from the start, because she is the wife of one of David's army captains, Uriah (Kieron Moore).David, uncharacteristically, wants Bathsheba at any cost. His is a passion that will not be denied. When she capitulates, it is to have great ramifications for all the parties involved. When their transgression and the lengths to which David went to secure Bathsheba for himself become known, it is Bathseheba who may pay the ultimate price in order to expiate their sin.Gregory Peck seems ill at ease in this role and a bit stiff, though he revives at the end in order to quell God's wrath. Susan Hayward is beautiful, but she and Peck seem to lack chemistry. Jayne Meadows plays David's first wife, and she is very effective in the role of the woman scorned. Raymond Massey is excellent in the role of the prophet, Nathan, who calls David to judgment for his sin. It is Kieron Moore, however, who plays the role of Uriah, David's faithful captain and Bathsheba's cuckolded first husband, who steals the show.This 1951 film, which received three Academy Award nominations, is a biblical epic that, despite some of its shortcomings, still manages to entertain the viewer.",3,SIN AND REDEMPTION...,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,1300,"['story', 'love', 'David', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'King', 'Israel', 'Bathsheba', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'love', 'doomed', 'start', 'wife', 'one', 'David', 'army', 'captains', 'Uriah', 'Kieron', 'Moore', '.David', 'uncharacteristically', 'Bathsheba', 'cost', 'passion', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'When', 'have', 'great', 'ramifications', 'parties', 'involved', 'When', 'transgression', 'lengths', 'David', 'went', 'secure', 'Bathsheba', 'become', 'known', 'Bathseheba', 'who', 'may', 'pay', 'ultimate', 'price', 'order', 'expiate', 'sin.Gregory', 'Peck', 'ill', 'ease', 'role', 'bit', 'stiff', 'end', 'order', 'quell', 'God', 'wrath', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'beautiful', 'Peck', 'seem', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'Jayne', 'Meadows', 'David', 'first', 'wife', 'very', 'effective', 'role', 'woman', 'scorned', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'excellent', 'role', 'prophet', 'Nathan', 'who', 'David', 'judgment', 'sin', 'Kieron', 'Moore', 'however', 'who', 'role', 'Uriah', 'David', 'faithful', 'captain', 'Bathsheba', 'cuckolded', 'first', 'husband', 'who', 'show.This', '1951', 'film', 'received', 'three', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'biblical', 'epic', 'shortcomings', 'still', 'entertain', 'viewer']",N/A

Although nowhere near as good as the Ten Commandments this movie is worth adding to your collection. The film ran about 2 hours long and focuses on a love story between David (Gregory Peck) and Bathsheba (Susan Hayward). Michal played by (Jayne Meadows) is great in her role as the jealous wife. Much of the Bible was cut out of the movie such as Absalom's uprising and the birth of Solomon. The movie get's its purpose across however. The great King David beloved of God falls from grace because of his love for one woman. The film was nominated for 5 Academy Awards. It earned 7$ million at the U.S. Box Office in 1951 making this film the most popular movie of the year. There are great shots of the plains and desert which took place in Nogales Arizona.This film was up for an Academy Award for its extravagant costuming. The actors wore bright reds, dark greens, and brilliant orange. Gregory Peck certainly looks like an Israelite King. Susan Hayward was simply beautiful with her long curly brown hair. The movie does follow the Bible but is very condensed. This is however a beautiful movie that starts out as a love story between two people then ends up being a film of punishment and forgiveness.The last scene is the most powerful. Famine and drought has swept over the land of Israel.  David goes to the tent with the Arc of the Covenant and like Uzzah puts his hands on the Arc. Lightening strikes and David remembers  when he stoned Goliath and was loved by God. David prostrates him self then rain falls. The sinner King has been forgiven.

251742,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,6301412702,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","This 1951 Biblical epic, albeit showing its age, is still a very honest watch. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.This Biblical story is of course very well known, so there is hardly any need to describe it here. As far as I understood this film, King Vidor decided to show those events from three perspectives.The first one is of course the story of a God's chosen king (Gregory Peck) who breaks the covenant with God by a grievous and hateful sin and in the same time also violates the pact with his subjects, by commiting the vilest betrayal possible, against his most faithful and most devoted officer, a not-so-bright man who trusted him infinitely and therefore was as defenseless as a baby...The second one is a middle age crisis of an eminent man, who achieved a great lot in his life, but who nevertheless finds himself terminally, morbidly unhappy, not the least because his principal wife Mihal became with age not only less attractive (which is unavoidable) but also turned into a nagging, hostile shrew (a perfectly avoidable mistake). As most men he also thinks more with what he has between the legs than with his head - and of course for those reasons he is ripe for picking for the cunning woman who is willing to profit from this oportunity.The third one is the ambition, anger and desire of revenge of a young and desirable woman who feels (deservedly) neglected by her husband and sees her young years slipping through her fingers without leaving anything but grief - and who happens to have for neighbour a God's chosen king who doesn't mind playing peeping Toms when she takes her bath...))) Played splendidly by Susan Hayward, in this film Bathsheba is a formidable woman, always calm and seemingly very innocent, but in fact she is the force that makes the things move on the chessboard - and under the mask of prude nobility she is venomous as a snake and absolutely merciless!Film's action has a good rhytm and dialogs are definitely less solemn and better than in many other Hollywoodian Biblical epics. There are moments of humour, some of them actually unvoluntary, like one of previous reviewers already noticed...))) Sorry for the SPOILER here but I simply couldn't resist the scenes (there is at least two of them) in which the already worn out David receives first the ""Envoys of the Pharaoh of Egypt"", who already give him hard time, and then immediately after ""Nathan, the Prophet of God"" who always comes to bust his @ss even worse...)))You will also certainly appreciate that Absalom, who in the distant future (not shown in this film) will betray his father and rebel, well, even if he is still a child is already all the time playing with a knife...)))And yes, there is of course some soft porn with half naked dancers, as in those old times Hollywood simply couldn't resist the temptation to seize the Biblical pretext in order to show some skin...)))Some minimal knowledge of Old Testament is required to fully appreciate this film, as there are many alusions to what happened in the past between David, his predecessor Saul and latter's son, Jonathan. The conclusion of the film is, I believe, not exactly faithful to the scriptures but quite beautiful and uplifting.Bottom line, I liked this film a lot and I will cetainly keep my DVD.

I watched this movie on TV some years ago, and I don't remember this flaw in the presentation.The DVD case says ""Full Frame: This Film is Presented in a Full Frame Format Preserving the Aspect Ratio of Its Original Theatrical Exhibition.""  I don't see how this can be.  Would the original theatrical exhibition have cut off the top of Gregory Peck's head, and the heads of other characters, several times?  Hard to believe that an A-list movie would do that.  Also, I'm not convinced that some parts of the scenes aren't cut off at the sides; the scenes of dancers in the court, etc., look as if they originally showed more to the left and right.  However, I can't be sure of that, whereas I'm sure of the chopped-off heads.Does anyone know anything about various DVD (or even VHS) versions of this film?  Do I have a flawed copy, or do all available versions of this film suffer from the same problem?  And if so, how did the TV presentation I saw years ago not have the same flaw?  Or is my memory simply faulty?

Others see it as a story of grace, restoration, and hope... It is actually both - Henry King illustrates the portrait of a mighty monarch almost destroyed by his passion, his downward spiral of sin, and his upward climb of healing..'David and Bathsheba' is an emotional movie full of vividly memorable characters who attain mythic status while retaining their humanity... Henry King handles the powerful story, taken from the Old Testament, with skill...David, 'the lion of Judah,' having stormed the walls of Rabgah, saves the life of one of his faithful warriors Uriah (Kieron Moore), and returns to Jerusalem...Back at his court, his first wife complains of neglect, and offends him for being a shepherd's son, distinguishing herself for being the daughter of King Saul...One evening, and while walking on the terrace of his palace which evidently held a commanding view of the neighborhood, David's eyes happened to alight upon a young lady who was taking a refreshing bath... She was beautiful and attractive... David could not take his eyes off her... He finds out later on that she was the wife of one of his officers...Sending for her, he discovers that she, too, is unhappy in her marriage... By this point, it's apparent that David's intentions shift from an interest in taking Bathsheba as a wife, to just plain taking Bathsheba... As usual, sin had its consequences, and David hadn't planned on that possibility...When a drought sweeps the land and there is a threat of famine, David suspects that the Lord is punishing him and his people for his sin... But when Bathsheba tells him that she is pregnant and fears that she may be stoned to death according to the law of Moses, David tries to cover up his sin...He sends word to Joab, the commander of his army, and ordered him to send to him Bathsheba's husband... David did something that was abominable in God's sight... He sends the man to the front line where he would be killed...The soldier is indeed killed and with him out of the way, David marries his beloved Bathsheba in full regal splendor...God punishes the couple when Bathsheba's child dies soon after birth... Meanwhile, a mighty famine has spread throughout the land and the Israelites - led by Nathan - blame the King for their plight... They storm the palace and demand that Bathsheba pays for her sin...Peck plays the compassionate king whose lustful desire outweighed his good sense and integrity..Hayward as Bathsheba, is a sensitive woman who begins to believe that every disaster occurring in her life is the direct result of her adultery... The sequence of her bath which could have been a great moment in Biblical film history, is badly mishandled, and the viewers eyes are led briefly to Hayward's face and shoulders...Raymond Massey appeared as Nathan the Prophet, sent by God to rebuke David after his adultery with Bathsheba; Gwyneth Verdon is Queen Michal who tries to resist the ambition and greed that have become integral to David's personality and kingship; ex-silent screen idol, Francis X. Bushman, had a brief part as King Saul...The best moments of the film were: The Ark en route to its permanent home when God breaks a young soldier who tries to touch the sacred object; the defining moment in David's life when he confesses his sin and is prepared to accept his punishment of death; and for the film's climax, inserting it as a flashback, David remembering his fight with the giant Goliath...With superb color photography and a masterly music score, 'David and Bathsheba' won Oscar nominations in the following categories: Music Scoring, Art and Set Direction, Cinematography, Story and Screenplay, and Costume Design..",3,Henry King handles the powerful story with skill!,1166918400,"12 24, 2006",2006,3744,"['Biblical', 'film', 'story', 'judgment', 'condemnation', 'Others', 'see', 'story', 'grace', 'restoration', 'hope', 'actually', 'Henry', 'King', 'portrait', 'mighty', 'monarch', 'almost', 'destroyed', 'passion', 'downward', 'spiral', 'sin', 'upward', 'climb', ""healing..'David"", 'Bathsheba', 'emotional', 'movie', 'full', 'vividly', 'memorable', 'characters', 'who', 'attain', 'mythic', 'status', 'retaining', 'humanity', 'Henry', 'King', 'powerful', 'story', 'taken', 'Old', 'Testament', 'skill', 'David', 'lion', 'Judah', 'having', 'stormed', 'walls', 'Rabgah', 'life', 'one', 'faithful', 'warriors', 'Uriah', 'Kieron', 'Moore', 'returns', 'Jerusalem', 'Back', 'court', 'first', 'wife', 'complains', 'neglect', 'being', 'shepherd', 'son', 'distinguishing', 'being', 'daughter', 'King', 'Saul', 'One', 'evening', 'walking', 'terrace', 'palace', 'evidently', 'held', 'commanding', 'view', 'neighborhood', 'David', 'eyes', 'happened', 'alight', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'was', 'taking', 'refreshing', 'bath', 'was', 'beautiful', 'attractive', 'David', 'could', 'not', 'take', 'eyes', 'out', 'later', 'was', 'wife', 'one', 'officers', 'Sending', 'too', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'point', 'apparent', 'David', 'intentions', 'shift', 'interest', 'taking', 'Bathsheba', 'wife', 'just', 'plain', 'taking', 'Bathsheba', 'usual', 'sin', 'had', 'consequences', 'David', 'had', ""n't"", 'planned', 'possibility', 'When', 'drought', 'land', 'threat', 'famine', 'David', 'Lord', 'punishing', 'people', 'sin', 'when', 'Bathsheba', 'pregnant', 'fears', 'may', 'be', 'stoned', 'death', 'according', 'law', 'Moses', 'David', 'cover', 'up', 'sin', 'word', 'Joab', 'commander', 'army', 'ordered', 'send', 'Bathsheba', 'husband', 'David', 'did', 'something', 'was', 'abominable', 'God', 'sight', 'man', 'front', 'line', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'killed', 'soldier', 'indeed', 'killed', 'way', 'David', 'beloved', 'Bathsheba', 'full', 'regal', 'splendor', 'God', 'couple', 'when', 'Bathsheba', 'child', 'dies', 'soon', 'birth', 'Meanwhile', 'mighty', 'famine', 'spread', 'land', 'Israelites', 'led', 'Nathan', 'blame', 'King', 'plight', 'storm', 'palace', 'demand', 'Bathsheba', 'sin', 'Peck', 'compassionate', 'king', 'lustful', 'desire', 'outweighed', 'good', 'sense', 'integrity..Hayward', 'Bathsheba', 'sensitive', 'woman', 'who', 'believe', 'disaster', 'occurring', 'life', 'direct', 'result', 'adultery', 'sequence', 'bath', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'moment', 'Biblical', 'film', 'history', 'badly', 'mishandled', 'viewers', 'eyes', 'are', 'led', 'briefly', 'Hayward', 'face', 'shoulders', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'appeared', 'Nathan', 'Prophet', 'sent', 'God', 'rebuke', 'David', 'adultery', 'Bathsheba', 'Gwyneth', 'Verdon', 'Queen', 'Michal', 'who', 'resist', 'ambition', 'greed', 'have', 'become', 'integral', 'David', 'personality', 'kingship', 'ex-silent', 'screen', 'idol', 'Francis', 'X.', 'Bushman', 'had', 'brief', 'part', 'King', 'Saul', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'were', 'Ark', 'en', 'route', 'permanent', 'home', 'when', 'God', 'young', 'soldier', 'who', 'touch', 'sacred', 'object', 'defining', 'moment', 'David', 'life', 'when', 'sin', 'prepared', 'accept', 'punishment', 'death', 'film', 'climax', 'inserting', 'flashback', 'David', 'remembering', 'fight', 'giant', 'Goliath', 'superb', 'color', 'photography', 'masterly', 'music', 'score', ""'David"", 'Bathsheba', 'won', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'following', 'categories', 'Music', 'Scoring', 'Art', 'Set', 'Direction', 'Cinematography', 'Story', 'Screenplay', 'Costume', 'Design..']",N/A

Each line reveals some aspect of Israelite culture as well as developing the character and advancing the plot. Not a word is wasted; and the actors, especially Peck, express the script effectively by using restraint. What others have called ""stiff"" performances are really spare and subtle. It never devolves into the cheap splashy schmaltz of other epics of the era. In the death scene of her child, Hayward never over-emotes, but without even seeing her face, her muffled sobs by the cradle are more moving than over-acting would have been. The score is very good, as are the costumes and sets, but again, all are used with restraint, to serve the story, and not overshadow it. The film respects the script, which in turn respects its source.  The understated dialogue and Peck's wonderful face express much; his human imperfection, and his complex attitude toward Hebrew beliefs and Laws, even Israel's relations with other nations, and with Nature itself. A central theme is the dissapointment and cynicism of adulthood and nostalgia for lost innocence.  It resolves with a satisfying, if typical, redemptive ending; done with good taste.

251759,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6301412702,Simon Davis,"[2, 4]","At first glance I found Gregory Peck an odd choice to play one of the great characters from the Bible in ""David and Bathsheba"". For most movie fans he is associated much more with modern day dramas such as ""On The Beach"", ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", and ""The Omen"", and always seems to possess a decidely modern screen persona. However I found as the story progressed that he seemed to fit in better with the character and gave David an interesting slant that I had never thought about before. ""David and Bathsheba"", was one of Twentieth Century Fox's biggest productions for 1951 and while it is lavish in construction and boasts a fine cast it is not your typical Cecil B. DeMille type of biblical epic so common in the 1950's. Apart from the construction of the walls of Jerusalem in the Californian desert, and David's throne room there are really no lavish set pieces so the interest in th emovie is definately on th echaracterisations and the dialogue which for th emost part are first rate. Interestingly David is not painted as a living saint in ""David and Bathsheba"", as is so often the way in these stories but instead as a man with weaknesses to which he succumbs on occasion. This different and seemingly more adult approach to retelling a famous story of the Bible makes for interesting viewing and despite the fact that the talented Susan Hayward as Bathsheba, has like Gregory Peck a largely modern screen persona, she as always delivers an interesting interpretation of this ""scarlet woman"" who almost toppled david's throne.",4,Less Opulent 1950's Biblical Drama With Some Interesting Performances,1146096000,"04 27, 2006",2006,1538,"['first', 'glance', 'found', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'odd', 'choice', 'play', 'one', 'great', 'characters', 'Bible', 'David', 'Bathsheba', 'most', 'movie', 'fans', 'associated', 'much', 'more', 'modern', 'day', 'dramas', 'such', 'Beach', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Omen', 'always', 'possess', 'decidely', 'modern', 'screen', 'persona', 'However', 'found', 'story', 'progressed', 'seemed', 'fit', 'better', 'character', 'gave', 'David', 'interesting', 'slant', 'had', 'never', 'thought', 'before', 'David', 'Bathsheba', 'was', 'one', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'biggest', 'productions', '1951', 'lavish', 'construction', 'fine', 'cast', 'not', 'typical', 'Cecil', 'B.', 'DeMille', 'type', 'biblical', 'epic', 'so', 'common', '1950', 'Apart', 'construction', 'walls', 'Jerusalem', 'Californian', 'desert', 'David', 'throne', 'room', 'are', 'really', 'lavish', 'set', 'pieces', 'interest', 'th', 'emovie', 'definately', 'th', 'echaracterisations', 'dialogue', 'th', 'emost', 'part', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'Interestingly', 'David', 'not', 'painted', 'living', 'saint', 'David', 'Bathsheba', 'so', 'often', 'way', 'stories', 'instead', 'man', 'weaknesses', 'occasion', 'different', 'seemingly', 'more', 'adult', 'approach', 'retelling', 'famous', 'story', 'Bible', 'interesting', 'viewing', 'fact', 'talented', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'Bathsheba', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'largely', 'modern', 'screen', 'persona', 'always', 'interesting', 'interpretation', 'scarlet', 'woman', 'who', 'almost', 'toppled', 'david', 'throne']",N/A

251762,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,6301412702,The Mysterious Traveler,"[2, 2]","The third film in Golden Age Hollywood's unofficial and unintended series on the House of David afterTHE STORY OF RUTH(1960)andSAUL AND DAVID(1964)DAVID AND BATHSHEBA(1951) Directed by Henry King. Script by PhilipDunne. Based on the book THE BIBLE by God. Makeup by Ben Nye. Score byAlfred Newman. Produced by Darryl F. Zanuck.Starring Gregory Peck(as King David), Susan Hayward(asBathsheba), Raymond Massey(as Nathan), Kieron Moore, James RobertsonJustice, Jayne Meadows(as Michal), John Sutton, Dennis Hoey(as Joab),Francis X. Bushman(as King Saul) Holmes Herbert, Sean McClory, WalterTalun(as Goliath), Gwen Verdon and George Zucco.Set several years after the previous film(see SAUL AND DAVID), David is now King ofan increasingly glorious Israel and yet is also increasingly unhappyand disastisfied as he misses the freedom and glory of his youth aswell as the communion that he once had with God. When he encounters themarried woman Bathsheba, he begins a reluctant but inevitable pathtowards sin and tragedy.An interesting though not entirely successful attempt to do theBiblical epic as a psychological character study as well as anexamination of the toll real politic might have on the spirit of aheretofore virtuous man. Hayward is rather fetching as the ladyBathsheba and is convincing as a woman who could tempt a man to greatsin. Peck as the generally unhappy King David is a tower of classictragedy and Massey is perfect as the prophet Nathan. It is kind of funthat Zucco, known to horror fans for his work in the Universal Kharisthe Mummy series, should be cast as the Egyptian Ambassador for thePharoah to the Court of King David. The film's main flaw is that itplays as a set up for an act two that was never filmed as David'sactions here will, historically, result in a civil war that willthreaten Israel's existence and put brother against brother and fatheragainst son as the wicked Prince Absolom(here still a preteen) willattempt to displace his father David. The film also seems to be settingup a conflict with Eygpt. Perhaps a sequel was planned? Perhaps thefilm was intended to be much longer?In any case, the film, intended or not, gives the correctimpression, as does SAUL AND DAVID, that history does not have happyendings but just keeps on going after the end credits. This might beoffputting to the viewer.Still a good solid film well worth seeing.For my last review of the last film in unofficial HOUSE OF DAVID series where tiny Israel must finally face the full power of Egypt seeSOLOMON AND SHEBA(1959)",4,The Decline of the House of David,1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,2535,"['third', 'film', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Hollywood', 'unofficial', 'unintended', 'series', 'House', 'David', 'afterTHE', 'STORY', 'OF', 'RUTH', '1960', 'andSAUL', 'DAVID', '1964', 'DAVID', 'AND', 'BATHSHEBA', '1951', 'Directed', 'Henry', 'King', 'Script', 'PhilipDunne', 'Based', 'book', 'THE', 'BIBLE', 'God', 'Makeup', 'Ben', 'Nye', 'Score', 'byAlfred', 'Newman', 'Produced', 'Darryl', 'F.', 'Zanuck.Starring', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'King', 'David', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'asBathsheba', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'Nathan', 'Kieron', 'Moore', 'James', 'RobertsonJustice', 'Jayne', 'Meadows', 'Michal', 'John', 'Sutton', 'Dennis', 'Hoey', 'Joab', 'Francis', 'X.', 'Bushman', 'King', 'Saul', 'Holmes', 'Herbert', 'Sean', 'McClory', 'WalterTalun', 'Goliath', 'Gwen', 'Verdon', 'George', 'Zucco.Set', 'several', 'years', 'previous', 'film', 'see', 'SAUL', 'AND', 'DAVID', 'David', 'now', 'King', 'ofan', 'increasingly', 'glorious', 'Israel', 'yet', 'also', 'increasingly', 'unhappyand', 'disastisfied', 'freedom', 'glory', 'youth', 'aswell', 'communion', 'once', 'had', 'God', 'When', 'themarried', 'woman', 'Bathsheba', 'reluctant', 'inevitable', 'pathtowards', 'sin', 'tragedy.An', 'interesting', 'not', 'entirely', 'successful', 'attempt', 'do', 'theBiblical', 'epic', 'psychological', 'character', 'study', 'as', 'well', 'anexamination', 'toll', 'real', 'politic', 'might', 'have', 'spirit', 'aheretofore', 'virtuous', 'man', 'Hayward', 'rather', 'fetching', 'ladyBathsheba', 'convincing', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'tempt', 'man', 'greatsin', 'Peck', 'generally', 'unhappy', 'King', 'David', 'tower', 'classictragedy', 'Massey', 'perfect', 'prophet', 'Nathan', 'kind', 'funthat', 'Zucco', 'known', 'horror', 'fans', 'work', 'Universal', 'Kharisthe', 'Mummy', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'cast', 'Egyptian', 'Ambassador', 'thePharoah', 'Court', 'King', 'David', 'film', 'main', 'flaw', 'set', 'up', 'act', 'two', 'was', 'never', 'filmed', ""David'sactions"", 'here', 'will', 'historically', 'result', 'civil', 'war', 'willthreaten', 'Israel', 'existence', 'put', 'brother', 'brother', 'fatheragainst', 'son', 'wicked', 'Prince', 'Absolom', 'here', 'still', 'preteen', 'willattempt', 'displace', 'father', 'David', 'film', 'also', 'be', 'conflict', 'Eygpt', 'Perhaps', 'sequel', 'was', 'planned', 'Perhaps', 'thefilm', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'much', 'longer', 'case', 'film', 'intended', 'not', 'correctimpression', 'SAUL', 'AND', 'DAVID', 'history', 'not', 'have', 'happyendings', 'just', 'keeps', 'going', 'end', 'might', 'beoffputting', 'viewer.Still', 'good', 'solid', 'film', 'well', 'seeing.For', 'last', 'review', 'last', 'film', 'unofficial', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'DAVID', 'series', 'where', 'tiny', 'Israel', 'must', 'finally', 'face', 'full', 'power', 'Egypt', 'seeSOLOMON', 'AND', 'SHEBA', '1959']",N/A
251763,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6301412702,Trevor Willsmer,"[2, 2]","There's no shortage of bad dialog in David and Bathsheba - ""I was quite a hand with a slingshot,"" ""The King of all Israel out there in the darkness exposing himself to the enemy"" (full marks to Dennis Hooey for delivering that one with a straight face), ""Go and sit with the concubines."" And somehow I doubt a bored David ever told the prophet Nathan ""Whatever you say."" He even tries the old ""My kingdom doesn't understand me"" routine on desperate housewife Bathsheba at one point. So it's probably a tribute to Henry King's direction that the film isn't at all bad despite the pitfalls much of the first third provide.Maybe it's to play down the censor-baiting nature of the plot - a married man kills a femme fatale's husband and gets away with it! - but King brings out the growing moral and theological complexities in Phillip Dunne's script rather than upping the sin and sandals hokum. This is the conflicted David on the downhill slope, abandoned by a vengeful God he no longer understands, and the film doesn't back away from the awkward unanswerable questions about why a loving deity would choose to wreak vengeance on the innocent rather than the guilty. It even offers a genuinely surprising criticism of the sexual inequality of the law, where the failings of husbands result in the punishment of their wives.Unlike King David, which sidelined the king in favor of the admittedly more interesting Saul, David is firmly at the center of the drama and despite an interesting display of shoulder twitching and a frankly gormless overlong close-up when visiting the site of Saul and Jonathan's death, Gregory Peck's performance grows in stature as David shrinks. Susan Hayward is pure Hollywood pro, Raymond Massey is an appropriately theatrical prophet (why be naturalistic when you've got a voice that makes the very heavens quake?) and Kieron Moore's Uriah such an intransigent unreconstructed chauvinist that you can't exactly blame David for putting him in harm's way, but despite threatening to soft peddle the film doesn't allow David a moral get out of jail free card over his death. With surprisingly strong but subdued design and Technicolor photography this is definitely a cut above most 40s-50s Biblical epics.Fox's new DVD is a good transfer, including an incredibly hokey `candid' behind-the-scenes short and a trailer with brief shots deleted from the film's sole battle scene.",4,Above average 50s Biblical epic,1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,2403,"['shortage', 'bad', 'dialog', 'David', 'Bathsheba', 'was', 'quite', 'hand', 'slingshot', 'King', 'Israel', 'out', 'there', 'darkness', 'exposing', 'enemy', 'full', 'marks', 'Dennis', 'Hooey', 'delivering', 'one', 'straight', 'face', 'Go', 'sit', 'concubines', 'somehow', 'doubt', 'bored', 'David', 'ever', 'told', 'prophet', 'Nathan', 'say', 'even', 'old', 'kingdom', ""n't"", 'understand', 'routine', 'desperate', 'housewife', 'Bathsheba', 'one', 'point', 'probably', 'tribute', 'Henry', 'King', 'direction', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'pitfalls', 'much', 'first', 'third', 'provide.Maybe', 'play', 'down', 'censor-baiting', 'nature', 'plot', 'married', 'man', 'femme', 'fatale', 'husband', 'away', 'King', 'out', 'growing', 'moral', 'theological', 'complexities', 'Phillip', 'Dunne', 'script', 'rather', 'upping', 'sin', 'sandals', 'hokum', 'conflicted', 'David', 'downhill', 'slope', 'abandoned', 'vengeful', 'God', 'no', 'longer', 'understands', 'film', ""n't"", 'back', 'away', 'awkward', 'unanswerable', 'questions', 'why', 'loving', 'deity', 'would', 'choose', 'wreak', 'vengeance', 'innocent', 'rather', 'guilty', 'even', 'genuinely', 'surprising', 'criticism', 'sexual', 'inequality', 'law', 'where', 'failings', 'husbands', 'result', 'punishment', 'wives.Unlike', 'King', 'David', 'sidelined', 'king', 'favor', 'admittedly', 'more', 'interesting', 'Saul', 'David', 'firmly', 'center', 'drama', 'interesting', 'display', 'shoulder', 'twitching', 'frankly', 'gormless', 'close-up', 'when', 'visiting', 'site', 'Saul', 'Jonathan', 'death', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'performance', 'grows', 'stature', 'David', 'shrinks', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'pro', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'appropriately', 'theatrical', 'prophet', 'why', 'be', 'naturalistic', 'when', ""'ve"", 'got', 'voice', 'very', 'heavens', 'quake', 'Kieron', 'Moore', 'Uriah', 'intransigent', 'unreconstructed', 'chauvinist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'blame', 'David', 'putting', 'harm', 'way', 'threatening', 'soft', 'peddle', 'film', ""n't"", 'allow', 'David', 'moral', 'get', 'jail', 'free', 'card', 'death', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'subdued', 'design', 'Technicolor', 'photography', 'definitely', 'cut', 'most', '40s-50s', 'Biblical', 'epics.Fox', 'new', 'DVD', 'good', 'transfer', 'including', 'incredibly', 'hokey', 'candid', 'behind-the-scenes', 'short', 'trailer', 'brief', 'shots', 'deleted', 'film', 'sole', 'battle', 'scene']",N/A
