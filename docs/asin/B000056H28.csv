I even have respect for PETA and their effort to ethically treat animals.  That's a good mission to have.But, that is a message that does not play well as this 90 minute movie.  I mean with quotes like this ""Maybe there are people like me behind the eyes of another creature.""  just went too far for me.This movie was too melodramtic and my wife was calling out the plot points about one minute before each one which made for an abysmal screenplay.  The musical score was fine enough as was the melody.If you want a better dog movie, go get something like Old Yeller or Where the Red Fern Grows.  Both are probably equally molodramtic but at least they have a better story/screenplay to carry the story to the conclusion.This movie is literally for the dogs.",1,Basically a 90 minute PETA commerical.,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,821,"['First', 'grew', 'up', 'dogs', 'have', 'affection', 'dogs', 'even', 'have', 'respect', 'PETA', 'effort', 'ethically', 'treat', 'animals', 'good', 'mission', 'have.But', 'message', 'not', 'play', 'well', '90', 'minute', 'movie', 'mean', 'quotes', 'Maybe', 'are', 'people', 'eyes', 'creature', 'just', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'me.This', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'melodramtic', 'wife', 'was', 'calling', 'out', 'plot', 'points', 'one', 'minute', 'one', 'made', 'abysmal', 'screenplay', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'fine', 'enough', 'was', 'melody.If', 'want', 'better', 'dog', 'movie', 'go', 'get', 'something', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'Where', 'Red', 'Fern', 'Grows', 'are', 'probably', 'equally', 'molodramtic', 'least', 'have', 'better', 'story/screenplay', 'carry', 'story', 'conclusion.This', 'movie', 'literally', 'dogs']",N/A

Reum,"[4, 7]","Fluke, the warm and fuzzy star of the show does a fantastic job of gripping your heart, reeling you in, and telling the story.The movie starts with a somewhat confusing sequence involving a car chase.  If you're not paying attention when you start this film, you may need to skip back in order to pick up a few telling details.  For the most part this opening act isn't fully explained until the end of the film.  This adds some mystery and intrigue, but get ready for a bit of a surprise.In the movie, you'll follow young Fluke from the birth canal  (literally) through his young life.  It isn't long and he begins to ""remember"" things.  This leads him back to the family he was prematurely ripped away from.  You see Fluke was once a man!  He had a beautiful family and he wants to be with them once again.The movie is not overly complicated at first glance, but by the end my nine year old was quite confused.  When it was over he was mostly satisfied that there were lots of cute, lovable animals to watch.  The older kids liked the movie but found it to be ""sad"" or a little ""unsettling"".There is a clear and overt attempt to support reincarnation throughout the movie.  Several of the movie's characters are reincarnated and one more than once.  Although we would completely disagree with reincarnation and its denial of eternal reward or punishment, it offered our family an opportunity to discuss the belief that some folks have about reincarnation.This movie offers many topics you may want to discuss with kids.  Animal laboratory research and homelessness are topics that make their way onto your television screen.  Death is also prevalent throughout this show as at least two people and one animal perish.Overall, this is a well made film that can help you approach a philosophy believed by many.  Watch it together and support your beliefs as you discuss the movie's ideals and themes.  Of all the places you want your children to discover controversial and provocative ideas, wherever you are is a good place.",3,Cherish life no matter what form its in-Fluke,1071187200,"12 12, 2003",2003,2024,"['Fluke', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'star', 'show', 'fantastic', 'job', 'gripping', 'heart', 'reeling', 'telling', 'story.The', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'sequence', 'involving', 'car', 'chase', ""'re"", 'not', 'paying', 'attention', 'when', 'start', 'film', 'may', 'need', 'skip', 'back', 'order', 'pick', 'up', 'few', 'telling', 'details', 'most', 'part', 'opening', 'act', ""n't"", 'fully', 'explained', 'end', 'film', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'get', 'ready', 'bit', 'surprise.In', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'follow', 'young', 'Fluke', 'birth', 'canal', 'literally', 'young', 'life', ""n't"", 'long', 'remember', 'things', 'back', 'family', 'was', 'prematurely', 'ripped', 'away', 'see', 'Fluke', 'was', 'once', 'man', 'had', 'beautiful', 'family', 'be', 'once', 'again.The', 'movie', 'not', 'overly', 'complicated', 'first', 'glance', 'end', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'was', 'quite', 'confused', 'When', 'was', 'was', 'mostly', 'satisfied', 'were', 'lots', 'cute', 'lovable', 'animals', 'watch', 'older', 'kids', 'liked', 'movie', 'found', 'be', 'sad', 'little', 'unsettling', 'clear', 'overt', 'attempt', 'support', 'reincarnation', 'movie', 'Several', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'reincarnated', 'one', 'more', 'once', 'would', 'completely', 'disagree', 'reincarnation', 'denial', 'eternal', 'reward', 'punishment', 'offered', 'family', 'opportunity', 'discuss', 'belief', 'folks', 'have', 'reincarnation.This', 'movie', 'many', 'topics', 'may', 'want', 'discuss', 'kids', 'Animal', 'laboratory', 'research', 'homelessness', 'are', 'topics', 'make', 'way', 'television', 'screen', 'Death', 'also', 'prevalent', 'show', 'least', 'two', 'people', 'one', 'animal', 'perish.Overall', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'can', 'help', 'approach', 'philosophy', 'believed', 'many', 'Watch', 'together', 'support', 'beliefs', 'discuss', 'movie', 'ideals', 'themes', 'places', 'want', 'children', 'discover', 'controversial', 'provocative', 'ideas', 'are', 'good', 'place']",N/A
569140,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000056H28,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","I was torn whether to give Fluke a 1 or 5 star rating.  Why?  Because I was literally CRYING right from the very beginning.  Right when you see adorable puppies walking around in some back alley with their mother, I was crying.I'm 29 years old and I'm a man.  Guess what?  I WAS CRYING LIKE A BABY WATCHING FLUKE!This is seriously one of the most emotionally heart-breaking dog movies I've ever seen.First of all, I love golden retrievers with a passion.  I think they're absolutely the most adorable puppies and dogs on the face of the planet.Whichever writer was responsible for finding just the right golden retriever to star in Fluke did an AMAZING job.  I was looking into this dogs eyes and seeing one of the most intelligent animals I've ever seen.  We're talking a dog that made me cry just by his spot-on eye movements alone.  It's like the dog was part human.  He'd follow along perfectly to the movements of the little boy and his mother at *all* the right moments.  Amazing job on the writers part.The storyline... oh right.  Just by reading the description you know what to expect, and trust me, it delivers *exactly* how you're imaginging it would.  A husband/father comes back through reincarnation as a golden retriever to search for his wife and child.Eventually the wife and child notice that the dog is doing a ton of things that strongly resemble what their father/husband used to do, so they become interested and suspicious of the dogs actions.However, the majority of the storyline is about the golden retrievers adventures through a dreary city and just being a dog on the run from all the bad guys who keep threatening to put him in doggy prison.He meets a friend -another much bigger and older (and more street smart) dog, and so the two dogs then become close friends.Yes, you will hear voice actors actually talking to indicate that the two dogs are communicating with each other.  It actually works though.  Works REALLY well.  Remember- I was actually crying hard watching this film earlier today.  I wouldn't be crying if it hadn't worked- I would've been laughing, and I definitely wasn't doing that!I absolutely love Fluke... or hate it!  It's one of these strong reactions for sure!  I watched this movie when it first came out, but since that time I've learned to appreciate dogs even more, so the storyline really hit me incredibly hard.  If you absolutely love dogs...  I don't know.  I seriously can't recommend it... or do I STRONGLY recommend it?

The trailer made the movie look like it was simply a movie for children about a man who died and came back as a dog and found his way home. I wasn't really interested. One day I was watching TV and I caught the movie almost near the end - I was captivated. And I realized the movie was about way more than simply a lost puppy. This movie is something that you won't expect - it leaves you thinking one thing until the end. (Much like a Sixth Sense fashion). &quot;Fluke&quot; begins with a man named Tom. We only see glimpses of Tom and another man driving on the road, and suddenly he swerves out of the way of a truck and is killed. The next scene we see is an ADORABLE puppy - Tom was reborn as the puppy! The movie follows the puppy through the beginnings of life (and although some parts of the movie are a bit cheesey- the animal acting is magnificant.. especially Comet aka Fluke's performance.. near the end he fakes a limp.. and I was so impressed.. I think the animal actors did better than the actor that played Tom's son!) The puppy grows up and keeps having flashes of his life before, of his wedding as a man, his wife, his son. So Fluke, as he's called - decides to find his long lost family. He meets a lot of friends along the way - such as Rombo a lovable dog that teaches him the ropes. There are some sad parts in the movie, but once you see the end it all makes sense.

Never has an animal performed with such emotion as Comet does in this tear-jerker, yet satisfying movie.  The human stars take back seats to both Fluke and Rombo (wonderfully voiced by the ubiquitous Samuel L. Jackson).  Nancy Travis had the glowing warmth and beauty needed to convey the hopelessness Fluke must feel in realizing he can't have his life back.  Based on a novel by spook writer James Herbert, the script pulls a real doozy on you at the end, and it's finale in the cemetery is poignantly touching.  Without using the techniques in BABE (Which were fine for that movie), FLUKE captures your heart by showing you the love a dog can bring into a life, especially when it's been reincarnated.

The screen writers completely rewrite the finish leaving one to wonder if his former wife had any notion of who Fluke was or had been; despite her tears it was difficult to tell. Again, the scene found nowhere in the book. Also, Tom's former business partner staying the night with his wife while they were not married. In the book, they had been married, though Fluke had no knowledge of this. Still, who can forget the characters, and who cannot be touched by the conclusion, the reconnecting of Rumbo and Fluke.

569163,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000056H28,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[6, 7]","Fluke (Carlo Carlei, 1995)There is book, and there is film. And every once in a while, there are book and film that are utterly unlike one another, and yet both are brilliant. Perhaps the best-known example of this phenomenon is Stephen King's novel and Tobe Hooper's TV miniseries 'Salem's Lot, which bear at best a passing resemblance as narrated by a gallon drunk. Fluke comes off the same way, and despite Carlei's ham-handedness, this movie works.First, you have to realize this movie is based on a novel by James Herbert. The phrases ""James Herbert"" and ""family film"" are incapable of existing in the same sentence without quotes around them, or some sort of weird dimensional rift will open in the Universe, and the things that come through will eat all humanity, but not before subjecting it to weird perverse tortures. (No, they're not Cenobites. The things in James Herbert's imagination eat Cenobites for breakfast and use the nails as toothpicks.) So one has to wonder, as I have for the past ten years, how any movie based on a James Herbert novel could possibly be called a ""wonderful family film"" by, erm, at least one critic blurbed on the DVD cover. I forget which. Then I remembered 'Salem's Lot, and still had some hope that we might get a good film out of it (film adaptations of James Herbert novels tend to be bloody boring-- they cut out all the good bits to avoid the video nasty laws). Then they attach an unknown writer-director and Matthew Modine, a guy whose career was going nowhere fast in 1995 (though it did pick up again soon after this, and has almost hit its previous level). I got to the point where the only hope I had for this flick lay in Eric Stoltz, whom I have always loved and will always love, no matter how awful the films in which he appears (yes, I even forgave him Anaconda. He needed the money. Honest). So, finally, I got the chance to sit down and actually watch the thing... and it really is wonderful. It bears about as much resemblance to the James Herbert novel upon which it is based as the American all-beef Ball Park bears to its wondrous ancestor the haggis, but as with the scary meat products, each is great in its own way.Tom Johnson (Modine, recently in Transporter 2) and Jeff Newman (Stoltz, recently of The Butterfly Effect) are partners. In the opening scene, the two of them are racing down a country road. Johnson pulls up alongside Newman's car and tries to get him to pull over so they can talk. Newman ignores him, but Johnson doesn't get too long to try-- he ends up playing chicken with a truck, losing, and going over an embankment to his death. Thanks to the magic of special effects, we see his soul fly off and inhabit an Irish Setter pup. (And through the magic of film, you can get an Irish Setter pup from a mom who looks kind of like a collie mix.) The pup, who eventually becomes the title character, has a series of very nasty adventures early in his life (the first half-hour of this film makes me wonder why anyone called it a family film-- it is relentlessly depressing) before meeting Rumbo (xXx's Samuel L. Jackson), a big Saint Bernard who offers to teach him the ropes. Fluke is unhappy with his life as a dog, however; he has recurring dreams of Newman and his family, and he feels that his family is in danger.First, the bad things about the movie. Carlei is overly ham-handed with a number of his moral lessons (especially in the final voice-over, which any editor worth his salt should have burned rather than exposing it to the elements). If you're looking at the film as something to watch with the kiddies, you may have an uncomfortable time answering some questions from the younger ones about death and vivisection that are likely to be raised in the opening half-hour of the film. And the kid who voices Fluke-as-pup (Sam Gifaldi of the animated series Hey! Arnold) sounds as if he's reading, woodenly, off a teleprompter. The end, while not actually leaving any loose ends dangling, feels a little frayed. And Nancy Travis' line ""...he needs a bath. He's filthy!""is perhaps the most unintentionally funny ever voiced in kids' films; you will never see so well-groomed and well-fed a road dog as Fluke.The good things: well, the rest of the movie. The opening half-hour, while relentless, has no single scenes that will traumatize a kid any more than some of the stuff Disney put in their animated flicks when we were kids. Modine and Jackson have a great chemistry between them, and when Fluke starts spending most of his time around humans, things ride the line of sappy without ever quite crossing over. Most of all, Lynn Stalmaster, the High King of Casting Directors, made one of the most inspired choices of his career in Eric Stoltz. I can't explain why without ruining the crux of the film, but let's just say it would've been hard to achieve the effect the movie did without Eric Stoltz playing Newman. Perfect, perfect, casting.Unless you're a diehard James Herbert fan who can't separate  Fluke-the-film from Fluke-the-book, you'll probably end up loving this movie despite yourself. Yeah, yeah, the talking animal thing's way overdone. That doesn't mean it can't still be done well now and again. ****",4,Excellent film.,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,5214,"['Fluke', 'Carlo', 'Carlei', '1995', 'book', 'film', 'once', 'while', 'are',

I have no doubt it will stand up to the ""repeated viewing"" test.  The range of looks on Fluke's face is simply incredible, what a beautiful dog, a seeming old soul.  In all of Fluke's scenes you'd swear he's a sentient being, there's no hint of a trainer anywhere in the vicinity (also the case with other animals, e.g., dogs, a chimp, a squirrel, all behave and interact totally naturally, as though no cameras or people are present, just phenomenal).This movie is all about love of family, righting wrongs, and redemption.  It's profoundly moving and yet subtly so, not sentimental, saccharine or maudlin, dealing with death in an honorable way, neither trivializing it nor exploiting it.  I'm a big fan of films (so few and far between) that handle death gracefully, with dignity, and in a way that enriches us, delivers closure.  The movie works its magic on you below the surface, you won't see the tears coming.  And, there are a couple of surprising twists and a happy, perhaps slightly hokey but eminently satisfying ending.Personally, I think this film suitable for any child old enough to know that people die.  Other reviewers think not, though, so you might want to view it first to gauge its appropriateness for your own children.  Animal control officers are depicted as the bad guys (from the animals' point of view), which will warrant a talk with your kids about such matters.If you're an animal lover, I say buy this movie, you will LOVE it!And BTW, if you do, you may also like:The Story of the Weeping Camel...a joyful semi-documentary filmed by a native woman about her people, who love their animals, their environment, and each other, one of my favorite films ever.",5,SPLENDID movie about love and righting wrongs,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,1785,"['saw', 'network', 'TV', 'was', 'utterly', 'charmed', 'moved', 'immediately', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'have', 'doubt', 'will', 'stand', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'test', 'range', 'looks', 'Fluke', 'face', 'simply', 'incredible', 'what', 'beautiful', 'dog', 'seeming', 'old', 'soul', 'Fluke', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'swear', 'sentient', 'being', 'hint', 'trainer', 'anywhere', 'vicinity', 'also', 'case', 'other', 'animals', 'e.g.', 'dogs', 'chimp', 'squirrel', 'behave', 'interact', 'totally', 'naturally', 'cameras', 'people', 'are', 'present', 'just', 'phenomenal', '.This', 'movie', 'love', 'family', 'righting', 'wrongs', 'redemption', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'yet', 'subtly', 'so', 'not', 'sentimental', 'saccharine', 'maudlin', 'dealing', 'death', 'honorable', 'way', 'trivializing', 'exploiting', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'films', 'few', 'far', 'handle', 'death', 'gracefully', 'dignity', 'way', 'closure', 'movie', 'magic', 'surface', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'tears', 'coming', 'are', 'couple', 'surprising', 'twists', 'happy', 'perhaps', 'slightly', 'hokey', 'eminently', 'satisfying', 'ending.Personally', 'think', 'film', 'suitable', 'child', 'old', 'enough', 'know', 'people', 'die', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'think', 'not', 'though', 'might', 'want', 'view', 'first', 'gauge', 'appropriateness', 'own', 'children', 'Animal', 'control', 'officers', 'are', 'depicted', 'bad', 'guys', 'animals', 'point', 'view', 'will', 'warrant', 'talk', 'kids', 'such', 'matters.If', ""'re"", 'animal', 'lover', 'say', 'buy', 'movie', 'will', 'LOVE', 'BTW', 'do', 'may', 'also', 'like', 'Story', 'Weeping', 'Camel', 'joyful', 'semi-documentary', 'filmed', 'native', 'woman', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'animals', 'environment', 'other', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'ever']",N/A

His quest to find his human family is plagued with mystery, including the fact that he must unravel the story of his old business partner. Only when he remembers what truly happened between the two of them on the night of his death does ""Fluke"" realize how he must let his family know who he is and set things right.This movie is highly emotional and definitely a tear-jerker. I cry almost every time I watch it, at multiple parts; and I am admittedly not always the most sensitive person, nor a big blubberer over cheeseball stuff. Although grossly underrated, this movie has one of the most beautiful soundtracks I have ever heard. Just listen to the music in the background throughout the entire movie; it's magical! Slightly eerie, this film is for anyone who loves animals, mysteries, the supernatural, or just a really good film.The cemetery scene in which Fluke ""tells"" his wife who he is, before his grave, is particularly poignant.

It is NOT the 'cute animal' story it presents itself to be.There was more language in it than I expected. Nothing horrific, but things like 'damn' and a few 'what the hells'. Good to know so you can decide for your own family if you're okay with that or not. There's also a scene with a man rather pointedly chain smoking, which I generally don't expect to find in a 'family' movie.It's a rather violent movie for the genre/rating. There are various dog attack scenes (which could frighten children harboring any anxiety about dogs), a scene where a man fires a gun and intentionally hits an animal, and two different violent car crash scenes, as well as overtones of murder. And death, lots of death, from animals to people. Not what I gleaned from the cover or description at all and it might be upsetting to younger or more sensitive children.The message of this story is a good one, but I feel strongly that it's misrepresented in the description and cover. Don't expect a 'Babe' or 'Milo and Otis', because this is nothing like either of those. While I don't imagine for a second that my school-aged children were scarred from seeing it, it might be too much for some kids and parents should allow their younger children to see it with great caution.Decent story, but not the type of story it appears to be and probably inappropriate on various levels for the younger set.",2,Far darker and grittier than it's PG rating or 'cutesy' presentation lets on- probably not good for younger kids,1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,1478,"['understand', 'why', ""n't"", 'rated', 'PG13', 'seemed', 'really', 'push', 'boundaries', 'PG', 'movie', 'NOT', ""'cute"", 'animal', 'story', 'be.There', 'was', 'more', 'language', 'expected', 'Nothing', 'horrific', 'things', ""'damn"", 'few', 'hells', 'Good', 'know', 'so', 'can', 'decide', 'own', 'family', ""'re"", 'okay', 'not', 'also', 'scene', 'man', 'rather', 'pointedly', 'chain', 'smoking', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'find', ""'family"", 'movie.It', 'rather', 'violent', 'movie', 'genre/rating', 'are', 'various', 'dog', 'attack', 'scenes', 'could', 'frighten', 'children', 'harboring', 'anxiety', 'dogs', 'scene', 'where', 'man', 'gun', 'intentionally', 'animal', 'two', 'different', 'violent', 'car', 'crash', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'overtones', 'murder', 'death', 'lots', 'death', 'animals', 'people', 'Not', 'what', 'gleaned', 'cover', 'description', 'might', 'be', 'upsetting', 'younger', 'more', 'sensitive', 'children.The', 'message', 'story', 'good', 'one', 'feel', 'strongly', 'misrepresented', 'description', 'cover', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', ""'Babe"", ""'Milo"", 'Otis', 'nothing', 'do', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'second', 'school-aged', 'children', 'were', 'scarred', 'seeing', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'kids', 'parents', 'should', 'allow', 'younger', 'children', 'see', 'great', 'caution.Decent', 'story', 'not', 'type', 'story', 'be', 'probably', 'inappropriate', 'various', 'levels', 'younger', 'set']",N/A
