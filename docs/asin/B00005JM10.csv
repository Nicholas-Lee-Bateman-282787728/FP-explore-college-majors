611515,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JM10,A Customer,"[2, 5]","...My Comments:I was really expecting a very shallow movie that was all about big bikes and other big parts of human anatomy.  I wasn't really disappointed, but I was surprised that the sexual content was minimized (though the objectification of women was not, though there was at least one attempt to objectify a man too) and that there was an attempt to create a story here.Of course, the story wasn't very good, but I have to at least give them some credit for trying.  There are a number of plot holes and coincidences in the story that just don't make much sense.  The archaic twist that Kid is really Smoke's son wasn't at all surprising - this has been done a million times (Star Wars).  Kid also illustrates that he has virtually no morals when he tells his mother that he won't race anymore then turns around and races about 2 days later.  There's also the race with Dogg, which just kind of happens without any explanation.  It's kind of obvious that this is really just an attempt to keep Kid Rock involved with the movie.  And worst of all is the sudden change in Kid's attitude when he wins the race; as though beating your dad will make everything better...  I don't know who came up with this idea, but it was pretty silly.As for the acting, Lawrence Fishburne is a pretty good actor, so he actually had a positive influence on this movie.  Derek Luke, on the other hand, has a lot of growing to do.  Especially bad was his scene with Tina (Meagan Good), where he goes from not having a relationship with her at all to suddenly making love to her - I didn't see that coming.  There was no development of their relationship.  One minute Tina is telling him she doesn't even know who he is and the next she is going for a ride of her own.  Some of the other peripheral actors, Soul Train (Orlando Jones) and Motherland (Djimon Hounsou) in particular, were pretty good, but they didn't have to do much.I should also note that despite the majority of the characters being black, this doesn't really fit into the 'black movie' genre, at least, not entirely.  Whereas movies like 'Friday After Next' are full of Ebonics and black-oriented jokes, this is a pretty straightforward mainstream movie that doesn't seem to be catering specifically to a black audience.  I was a little surprised by this considering the predominantly black cast, but probably shouldn't have been.  Because I have never really been able to appreciate black-oriented humor (I'm sorry, I just don't get it), I found the lack of it in this movie to be a relief.Overall, I don't think I would really recommend this movie, but if you like motorcycles, you might enjoy it.  Some of the acting is okay, but most of it isn't.  And the story, well, it's horrible.  I watched it because I thought it was going to be horrible and because it claimed to be better than 'The Fast and the Furious'.  I don't really think it was, but then again neither movie was really all that good, so it doesn't mean much either way.",2,Wasn't as bad as expected; but still pretty bad,1062288000,"08 31, 2003",2003,2988,"['Comments', 'was', 'really', 'expecting', 'very', 'shallow', 'movie', 'was', 'big', 'bikes', 'other', 'big', 'parts', 'human', 'anatomy', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'disappointed', 'was', 'surprised', 'sexual', 'content', 'was', 'minimized', 'objectification', 'women', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'least', 'one', 'attempt', 'objectify', 'man', 'too', 'was', 'attempt', 'create', 'story', 'here.Of', 'course', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'have', 'least', 'give', 'credit', 'trying', 'are', 'number', 'plot', 'holes', 'coincidences', 'story', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'archaic', 'twist', 'Kid', 'really', 'Smoke', 'son', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'been', 'done', 'million', 'times', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Kid', 'also', 'virtually', 'morals', 'when', 'mother', 'wo', ""n't"", 'race', 'anymore', 'then', 'around', 'races', '2', 'days', 'later', 'also', 'race', 'Dogg', 'just', 'kind', 'happens', 'explanation', 'kind', 'obvious', 'really', 'just', 'attempt', 'keep', 'Kid', 'Rock', 'involved', 'movie', 'worst', 'sudden', 'change', 'Kid', 'attitude', 'when', 'race', 'beating', 'dad', 'will', 'make', 'everything', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'was', 'pretty', 'silly.As', 'acting', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'pretty', 'good', 'actor', 'actually', 'had', 'positive', 'influence', 'movie', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'other', 'hand', 'lot', 'growing', 'do', 'Especially', 'bad', 'was', 'scene', 'Tina', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'where', 'not', 'having', 'relationship', 'suddenly', 'making', 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'was', 'development', 'relationship', 'One', 'minute', 'Tina', 'telling', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'who', 'next', 'going', 'ride', 'own', 'other', 'peripheral', 'actors', 'Soul', 'Train', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'Motherland', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'particular', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'much.I', 'should', 'also', 'note', 'majority', 'characters', 'being', 'black', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', ""'black"", 'movie', 'genre', 'least', 'not', 'entirely', 'Whereas', 'movies', ""'Friday"", 'Next', 'are', 'full', 'Ebonics', 'black-oriented', 'jokes', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'mainstream', 'movie', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'catering', 'specifically', 'black', 'audience', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'considering', 'predominantly', 'black', 'cast', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'able', 'appreciate', 'black-oriented', 'humor', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'found', 'lack', 'movie', 'be', 'relief.Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'really', 'recommend', 'movie', 'like', 'motorcycles', 'might', 'enjoy', 'acting', 'okay', 'most', ""n't"", 'story', 'well', 'horrible', 'watched', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'horrible', 'claimed', 'be', 'better', ""'The"", 'Fast', 'Furious', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'was', 'then', 'again', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'good', ""n't"", 'mean', 'much', 'way']",N/A

But a friend of mine bought the DVD and then talked me into watching it. I must say - it grabbed me from the beginning. I won't spoil things, but I will say that the film opens with a very impactful scene - in fact - I found myself identifying with and feeling for the characters right away. From there it had my attention. The movie is well done - very entertaining - and actually has some depth to it that you probably wouldn't have expected at first glance. Of course you have to admire Laurence Fishburne, who plays the famed Morpheus in the Matrix trilogy - and it surprised me to see Brendan Fehr in this flick as well. I remember him best from The Forsaken - loved him in that. Biker Boys appears to be a carbon copy of The Fast And The Furious - only on motorcycles - at the surface. But once you pop it in the DVD player and settle in, you realize right away that you were mistaken. Similarities? Yes. But this is no copy, it stands on its own. There is far less focus on the vehicles themselves and far more spotlight on the plot.

611545,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JM10,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","With this wrong title and its wrong timing of release, 'Biker Boys' had no chance from the beginning.  The fact is the film is not so bad -- as long as you don't care its very thin material.  The bike race scenes on the street are staged credibly, though not as powerful as those of 'The Fast and the Furious,' but the good cast (which include two Oscar nonimees) barely manage to interest us despite the weak story.  I mean, barely.What you watch is essentially this.  A young biker 'Kid' challenges the invincible king 'Smoke' in the world of urban bike racing.  That's all.  There are love interest, comic relief, another rival named 'Dogg' etc. plus truths about the birth of Kid, but none of them is memorable because of their oridinariness.  'Biker Boyz' tries to engage our attention, but the running time (110 mins) is so long, and we feel that.The good thing is, Smoke is played by Laurence Fishburne and Kid by Derek Luke.  Their acting talent, especially Derek Luke one of the most promising new faces these days, is surely undeniable even with their characters.  Yes, they are surprisingly likable, but if you feel the emotional tension between charismatic Smoke and headstrong Kid, it is because the actors are so good infusing the life into the so-so portraits of the characters.Clearly some part of the film (such as the strict rules about membership) are based on the research about the real-life bikers, but director Reggie Rock Bythewood seems to have chosen to stress the relations between characters.  So we see a few descriptions of West Coast bikers' culture, which could have made the film more interesting, but they are not developed enough.  In the same way, we see good turns from Orlando Jones and Djimon Hounsou (both are impressive), but their roles are undeservedly small.With better cast than 'Torque' and perhaps 'The Fast and the Furious' or its sequel, 'Biker Boyz' gets surprisingly serious at times.  That's a welcome change, but still the film needs something better than stereotyped characters, fast bikes, and pretty good acting from Kid Rock as ""Dogg.""",3,"(2.5 STARS) The Content Is Too Thin, But the Cast Is Still Impressive (And No More Boy'z'  Please)",1131408000,"11 8, 2005",2005,2092,"['wrong', 'title', 'wrong', 'timing', 'release', 'Boys', 'had', 'chance', 'beginning', 'fact', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'very', 'thin', 'material', 'bike', 'race', 'scenes', 'street', 'are', 'staged', 'credibly', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'powerful', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'good', 'cast', 'include', 'two', 'Oscar', 'nonimees', 'barely', 'manage', 'interest', 'weak', 'story', 'mean', 'watch', 'essentially', 'young', 'biker', 'invincible', 'king', ""'Smoke"", 'world', 'urban', 'bike', 'racing', 'are', 'love', 'interest', 'comic', 'relief', 'rival', 'named', ""'Dogg"", 'etc', 'truths', 'birth', 'Kid', 'none', 'memorable', 'oridinariness', 'Boyz', 'tries', 'engage', 'attention', 'running', 'time', '110', 'mins', 'so', 'long', 'feel', 'that.The', 'good', 'thing', 'Smoke', 'played', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Kid', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'acting', 'talent', 'especially', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'one', 'most', 'promising', 'new', 'days', 'surely', 'undeniable', 'even', 'characters', 'Yes', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'likable', 'feel', 'emotional', 'tension', 'charismatic', 'Smoke', 'headstrong', 'Kid', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'infusing', 'life', 'so-so', 'portraits', 'characters.Clearly', 'part', 'film', 'such', 'strict', 'rules', 'membership', 'are', 'based', 'research', 'real-life', 'bikers', 'director', 'Reggie', 'Rock', 'Bythewood', 'have', 'chosen', 'stress', 'relations', 'characters', 'see', 'few', 'descriptions', 'West', 'Coast', 'bikers', 'culture', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'interesting', 'are', 'not', 'developed', 'enough', 'same', 'way', 'see', 'good', 'turns', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'are', 'impressive', 'roles', 'are', 'undeservedly', 'small.With', 'better', 'cast', 'perhaps', ""'The"", 'Fast', 'Furious', 'sequel', 'Boyz', 'surprisingly', 'serious', 'times', 'welcome', 'change', 'still', 'film', 'something', 'better', 'stereotyped', 'characters', 'fast', 'bikes', 'pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'Kid', 'Rock', 'Dogg']",N/A
