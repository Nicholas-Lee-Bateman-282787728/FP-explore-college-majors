1155384,AXMKAXC0TR9AW,B00170JQAC,"Bill Emblom ""Bill Emblom""","[16, 16]","If you are interested in following the route of Christopher Columbus as he embarked on his four journeys to the Caribbean with an initial stop in the Canary Islands off the west coast of Africa this movie should be of interest to you.  We sail with approximately twelve intellectually curious young boys who are interested in learning about The Admiral of the Ocean Sea.  The movie doesn't specifically follow Columbus' first voyage, but rather visits places he visited during his four trips to the new world.  A visit is made off the Paria Peninsula of Venezuela and then north past the islands of Grenada, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and others in addition to a visit to Central America where Columbus visited on his fourth and final trip to the Caribbean.  Throughout the movie the boys ask questions about ancient findings they come across while their shipmates seem to have an answer for them.  The photography is good and we see underwater scenes as well.  The boys speak French throughout the movie which adds some exotic flavor to it, but this requires an English translation which can be annoying when you are trying to view the movie instead of having to read the spoken words in English.  I enjoyed the movie, and it is certainly viewable for the entire family.",4,A Field Trip With Intellectually Curious Boys,1177113600,"04 21, 2007",2007,1268,"['are', 'interested', 'following', 'route', 'Christopher', 'Columbus', 'embarked', 'four', 'journeys', 'Caribbean', 'initial', 'stop', 'Canary', 'Islands', 'west', 'coast', 'Africa', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'interest', 'sail', 'approximately', 'twelve', 'intellectually', 'curious', 'young', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'learning', 'Admiral', 'Ocean', 'Sea', 'movie', ""n't"", 'specifically', 'follow', 'Columbus', 'first', 'voyage', 'rather', 'visits', 'places', 'visited', 'four', 'trips', 'new', 'world', 'visit', 'made', 'off', 'Paria', 'Peninsula', 'Venezuela', 'then', 'north', 'islands', 'Grenada', 'Martinique', 'Guadeloupe', 'others', 'addition', 'visit', 'Central', 'America', 'where', 'Columbus', 'visited', 'fourth', 'final', 'trip', 'Caribbean', 'movie', 'boys', 'ask', 'questions', 'ancient', 'findings', 'come', 'shipmates', 'seem', 'have', 'answer', 'photography', 'good', 'see', 'underwater', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'boys', 'speak', 'French', 'movie', 'exotic', 'flavor', 'English', 'translation', 'can', 'be', 'annoying', 'when', 'are', 'trying', 'view', 'movie', 'instead', 'having', 'read', 'spoken', 'words', 'English', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'certainly', 'viewable', 'entire', 'family']",Western Lights

Phelps,"[3, 3]","The Juvenile Participants, French Boys 11 - 15 years old, were students in an Experimental School, who re-traced the voyage of Christopher Columbus from Seville in Spain to the new world.  I was a Sea Explorer, in the Boy Scouts of America, and know how talented it was for a crew of such young French boys to learn and actually sail their craft at sea, their knowledge and use of archeology and history about the voyage of Columbus! This is a very impressive DVDand requires the viewer, both adult and youngster, to know why the boys ran around the boat with chests bare, bathing in the buff when landing on the Islands or at sea, and wore bikini swimwear.  From my own experiences south of the Boarder, and military travels overseas in Spain, the heat and humidity can be very harsh.  I was not surprised to see the boys so ""bronzed"" by the Sun to their advantage.  Also, as much as possible, the boys re-enacted on land and at sea, how the Sailors and Officers on the Columbus Voyage lived, bathed, cooked and explored on each Island or land.

This is not a scripted movie, but rather a reality show, before reality shows were a fad. It is also more interesting than most of the reality shows on TV today.The movie is only part of the thirteen episodes which showed on French television, I think I would enjoy watching the full thirteen episodes.The boys are shown not only learning about history, but are also shown learning about archeology, geology, navigation, sailing (they are both students and crew), and wood working (they build some items out of wood to install on the boat while they are staying in one of the ports along the way). I am sure they also have to study regular school courses, but that is not shown.I am also sure a lot of boys would enjoy school a lot more if they could attend wearing their swim suits, or cutoffs, to say nothing of the extra excitement and fun of learning these subjects with an hands on approach instead of just out of a book.The pace of the movie is not fast, but it is a lot of fun.There are a couple of brief skinny dipping scenes in the movie. Once off of a rocky coast line where all of the boys are seen nude from the rear while getting in the water and playing about. The skinning dipping scene lasts about 30 seconds. Later the boys swim nude off the boat, this scene last about a minute, but actually less nudity is seen due to back lighting and camera angles.",5,Slow but real,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,1520,"['Observing', 'boys', 'follow', 'learn', 'Christopher', 'Columbus', 'journey', 'other', 'history', 'places', 'visit', 'was', 'interesting', 'not', 'scripted', 'movie', 'rather', 'reality', 'show', 'reality', 'shows', 'were', 'fad', 'also', 'more', 'interesting', 'most', 'reality', 'TV', 'today.The', 'movie', 'only', 'part', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'showed', 'French', 'television', 'think', 'would', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'full', 'thirteen', 'episodes.The', 'boys', 'are', 'shown', 'not', 'only', 'learning', 'history', 'are', 'also', 'shown', 'learning', 'archeology', 'geology', 'navigation', 'sailing', 'are', 'students', 'crew', 'wood', 'working', 'build', 'items', 'wood', 'install', 'boat', 'are', 'staying', 'one', 'ports', 'way', 'am', 'sure', 'also', 'have', 'study', 'regular', 'school', 'courses', 'not', 'shown.I', 'am', 'also', 'sure', 'lot', 'boys', 'would', 'enjoy', 'school', 'lot', 'more', 'could', 'attend', 'wearing', 'swim', 'suits', 'cutoffs', 'say', 'nothing', 'extra', 'excitement', 'fun', 'learning', 'subjects', 'hands', 'approach', 'instead', 'just', 'book.The', 'pace', 'movie', 'not', 'fast', 'lot', 'fun.There', 'are', 'couple', 'brief', 'skinny', 'dipping', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Once', 'rocky', 'coast', 'line', 'where', 'boys', 'are', 'seen', 'nude', 'rear', 'getting', 'water', 'playing', 'about', 'skinning', 'dipping', 'scene', 'lasts', '30', 'seconds', 'Later', 'boys', 'swim', 'nude', 'boat', 'scene', 'last', 'minute', 'actually', 'less', 'nudity', 'seen', 'due', 'back', 'lighting', 'camera', 'angles']",Western Lights
1155388,AHUT81XKK6N4G,B00170JQAC,michael,"[8, 9]",Interesting to see how lax safety precautions had been with boys and what appears to be no supervision with regard to handling machinery.  Video looks more like from the 70s and not from the 90s as touted. Otherwise this documentary seems OK. Would have been nice to see more supervisory input (but probably not the focus of the project). I can appreciate the innocent inquisitiveness and learning objectivity of the boys.  Really appreciated it not being so 'americanized' (for example: not wearing the dorky american long pant swim trunks down to the knees).

1155390,A1N4OFD1OGTVFI,B00170JQAC,Mr. Dudley J. Tate,"[58, 58]","""Western Lights"" is an amazing and very entertaining movie.It has restored my confidence in the good in human nature and in the desire inpeople to get along with others. It is appropriate that this lesson is taught by agroup of boys.This is an adventure movie and it documents a sailing trip following in the footstepsof Christopher Columbus from the Continent to the Americas in 1492.The trip is undertaken by a group of 12 boys who have prepared themselves wellfor the trip. They all have a good knowledge of the Columbus voyage and areenthusiastic to learn more. They all know the basics of good seamanship - how tonavigate and set a course and how to rig and sail the ship. They all possess otherskills which may prove to be required. With a group of boys this large and all livingclose together, you would expect some disagreements but this did not happen.They all very quickly became good mates. They listened to and respected eachothers views and were eager to share with other boys their own personalknowledge and opinions.This is an adventure and probably the biggest adventure that they willexperience in their lives. They visited all the ports of call and prominent landmarkson the way. They took exploration trips on land and sea, visiting at times themost inaccessible places. They also participated in snorkeling activities.What a pleasant experience both for the boys and the viewers of this movie. Allparents and their children should be encouraged to view ""Western Lights"". It isboth entertaining and educational and there is a lot to learn from it about humanbehaviour and tolerance.I believe that this film has been condensed to a two hour running time from a 13episode documentary made for French television. It may be regarded as a documentarybut it is also a story about individuals. The dialogue is spoken in French andthere are English sub-titles. However, don't let this throw you.
