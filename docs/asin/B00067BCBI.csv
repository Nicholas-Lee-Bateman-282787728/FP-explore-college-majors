862614,A1H4X50VE4K2W6,B00067BCBI,"A. D. Bowman ""64panther""","[7, 7]","This is a warm and well produced movie that you wouldn't ordinarily expect to find even on cable. The characters are clearly defined and the actors seem very cormfortable  in their roles. The movie pull no punches in re-creating a period in American history that for most of us seem so distant. However the crowning acheivement to me is how all the pieces fit. From the costumes, the subtle evolution of time from the Thirties on through the Seventies as the movie progress. The content and medical theme hold your interest, but it's the personal relationship between Doctor and helper that drives this movie. All the actors did exceedingly well, but it was Mos Def with his effortless approach and execution that really rises above the ordinary. This is a very good movie and historically invaluable to anyone who doesn't mind going beyond that which is accepted as either truth or entertainment. This is a winner and I recommend it to all thinking people who wish  to be enlightened and moved.

The things we take for granted now - from open heart surgery to integrated society to being able to get college credits for material we already know - none of these opportunities existed back when Dr. Vivien Theodore Thomas started helping Dr. Alfred Blalock. The film includes great performances by Alan Rickman (who is never bad in any of his roles, but is particularly strong here) and Mos Def. The film's powerful message and sincere treatment of history provide an excellent opportunity for further discussion of race relations, medical breakthroughs, and animal experimentation.",5,simply a great film that you must watch,1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,743,"['Unequivocally', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'medical', 'profession', 'film', 'also', 'portrayal', 'history', 'race', 'relations', 'America', 'things', 'take', 'granted', 'now', 'open', 'heart', 'surgery', 'integrated', 'society', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'college', 'credits', 'material', 'already', 'know', 'none', 'opportunities', 'existed', 'back', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Vivien', 'Theodore', 'Thomas', 'started', 'helping', 'Dr.', 'Alfred', 'Blalock', 'film', 'great', 'performances', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'who', 'never', 'bad', 'roles', 'particularly', 'strong', 'here', 'Mos', 'Def', 'film', 'powerful', 'message', 'sincere', 'treatment', 'history', 'provide', 'excellent', 'opportunity', 'further', 'discussion', 'race', 'relations', 'medical', 'breakthroughs', 'animal', 'experimentation']",Something the Lord Made
862616,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00067BCBI,Alistair McHarg,"[13, 13]","When I read the description of Something The Lord Made, I thought to myself - there is just no conceivable way that this is going to be interesting.  However, it did have a lot going for it.  It was directed by Joseph Sargent, who also directed the brilliant, A Lesson Before Dying.  It starred Alan Rickman who is so good he could make an IKEA commercial look like it was directed by Ingmar Bergman.  It paired Rickman with Mos Def, who has remarkable screen presence.  (I first noticed Mos Def in another exceptional film, The Woodsman, which, coincidentally or not, also featured Kyra Sedgwick.)  So, despite the promise of (in)action confined exclusively to a medical lab, I forged ahead.I'm so glad I did.  This is one of those minor gems you might easily miss.  Make sure to pay attention to the score, which is outstanding.  It's way too easy to sketch this movie out as an anti-racism diatribe, that's way too facile.  As with A Lesson Before Dying, racism is simply a fact, not a larger-than-life villain.  This, of course, makes the depiction that much more powerful.  We don't see the pain of racism courtesy of gassy soliloquies; we feel the pain of it as we read Mos Def's face watching Dr. Blalock receive his award at Baltimore's Biltmore Hotel.Why beat a dead parrot?  We know the Biltmore is segregated.  Vivien - Def - can only gain admittance by posing as a bellhop.  We know that Blalock is a vain and arrogant surgeon (quelle surprise!) only too willing to bask in glory that would never have been his without Vivien's remarkable contributions.  And yes, we know that the racist culture surrounding these men makes it easy for Blalock to distance himself from Vivien when it suits him.This context of racism is woven right into our flag; it's part of the culture, hardly newsworthy enough to merit a film.  The engine that's really driving Something The Lord Made is not racism at all; it's the subtle, complex relationship joining these very different men who share a passion for medicine.  The interplay between Vivien's self-effacing, quiet dignity and Blalock's braggadocio is pure gold, these two are so right for each other; they balance one another in a way that is touching at the very least.Certainly there were moments when I wanted to explain to the supercilious twits at Hopkins that Vivien was the genius behind the wheel and they should be lavishing praise on him.  At times it was sad, and Vivien's stoicism makes it sadder.  But the movie never takes cheap shots; Def and Rickman offer marvelously reserved performances, thereby increasing the impact.  Ultimately I was left with an overwhelmingly positive sense of how people can, and often do, achieve miraculous things despite the mountains of debris and bizarre baggage they've been saddled with.  A wonderful film.",5,Something HBO Made,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,2806,"['When', 'read', 'description', 'Something', 'Lord', 'Made', 'thought', 'myself', 'just', 'conceivable', 'way', 'going', 'be', 'interesting', 'However', 'did', 'have', 'lot', 'going', 'was', 'directed', 'Joseph', 'Sargent', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'brilliant', 'A', 'Lesson', 'Dying', 'starred', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'who', 'so', 'good', 'could', 'make', 'IKEA', 'commercial', 'look', 'was', 'directed', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'paired', 'Rickman', 'Mos', 'Def', 'who', 'remarkable', 'screen', 'presence', 'first', 'noticed', 'Mos', 'Def', 'exceptional', 'film', 'Woodsman', 'coincidentally', 'not', 'also', 'featured', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'So', 'promise', 'action', 'confined', 'exclusively', 'medical', 'lab', 'forged', 'ahead.I', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'one', 'minor', 'gems', 'might', 'easily', 'miss', 'Make', 'sure', 'pay', 'attention', 'score', 'outstanding', 'way', 'too', 'easy', 'sketch', 'movie', 'out', 'anti-racism', 'diatribe', 'way', 'too', 'facile', 'A', 'Lesson', 'Dying', 'racism', 'simply', 'fact', 'not', 'larger-than-life', 'villain', 'course', 'depiction', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'pain', 'racism', 'courtesy', 'gassy', 'soliloquies', 'feel', 'pain', 'read', 'Mos', 'Def', 'face', 'watching', 'Dr.', 'Blalock', 'receive', 'award', 'Baltimore', 'Biltmore', 'Hotel.Why', 'beat', 'dead', 'parrot', 'know', 'Biltmore', 'segregated', 'Vivien', 'Def', 'can', 'only', 'gain', 'admittance', 'posing', 'bellhop', 'know', 'Blalock', 'vain', 'arrogant', 'surgeon', 'quelle', 'surprise', 'only', 'too', 'willing', 'bask', 'glory', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'Vivien', 'remarkable', 'contributions', 'yes', 'know', 'racist', 'culture', 'surrounding', 'men', 'easy', 'Blalock', 'distance', 'Vivien', 'when', 'suits', 'him.This', 'context', 'racism', 'woven', 'right', 'flag', 'part', 'culture', 'hardly', 'newsworthy', 'enough', 'merit', 'film', 'engine', 'really', 'driving', 'Something', 'Lord', 'Made', 'not', 'racism', 'subtle', 'complex', 'relationship', 'joining', 'very', 'different', 'men', 'who', 'share', 'passion', 'medicine', 'interplay', 'Vivien', 'self-effacing', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'Blalock', 'braggadocio', 'pure', 'gold', 'two', 'are', 'so', 'right', 'other', 'balance', 'one', 'way', 'touching', 'very', 'least.Certainly', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'wanted', 'explain', 'supercilious', 'twits', 'Hopkins', 'Vivien', 'was', 'genius', 'wheel', 'should', 'be', 'lavishing', 'praise', 'times', 'was', 'sad', 'Vivien', 'stoicism', 'sadder', 'movie', 'never', 'cheap', 'shots', 'Def', 'Rickman', 'offer', 'marvelously', 'reserved', 'performances', 'thereby', 'increasing', 'impact', 'Ultimately', 'was', 'left', 'overwhelmingly', 'positive', 'sense', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'often', 'do', 'achieve', 'miraculous', 'things', 'mountains', 'debris', 'bizarre', 'baggage', ""'ve"", 'been', 'saddled', 'wonderful', 'film']",Something the Lord Made

So, the excellence of this production (it took home the 2004 Emmy for outstanding made-for-TV movie) may have passed us by were it not for the fact that we make it rule to see everything Alan Rickman does.  You never know when you might miss Rickman's droll underplaying winning the day in delightful surprises likeBlow DryorBottle Shock.Now, we can add 'Something the Lord Made' to that category of delights.  This stirring film captures the unlikely, real life partnership between Alfred Blalock (Rickman) and Vivien Thomas (Mos Def).  The two - and the movie's point is that it was The Two, not just Blalock - invented the entire discipline of cardiovascular surgery.  [In one of the film's sly and informed moments, Blalock addresses a student - 'Dr. Cooley.'  This would be Dr. Denton Cooley, a pioneer in the field himself, but depicted here as learning at the feet of Blalock...and Thomas.]I love the moment at the end of film in which hung portraits of Blalock and Thomas (renderings of 'retired' Rickman and Mos Def done for the movie) give way to the real-life portraits of the two men which hang in the halls of Johns Hopkins.  It's then you realize that this is one movie where the events weren't overplayed.  This is a true tale of triumph and friendship.This film is yet another quality effort from HBO Films.

It takes place in the 1930's, a society in which only doctors can be paged and blacks are only qualified to get donuts.  Alan Rickman and Mos Def play the men who got rid of the myth that heart surgery is impossible.  Rickman does a great job here as an egotistical southerner who does mean the best. He is probably underrated as an actor.  However, I have yet to buy the Mos Def bill of goods. Here and in ""The Woodsman"" he comes off as perpetually stoned, which eliminates any opportunity for his characters to come alive.  The main problem with this film is that it comes off as a standard biopic that failed to captivate me.  It even gives in to biopic clich&eacute;s like the nagging wife (in fact this one even has 2 of them).  These movies (""Ray"" and ""Miracle"" also spring to mind) would have you believe that females do much more to hinder progress than they do to inspire it.  And speaking of hindering progress the Church makes an appearance opposing heart surgery.  It makes you wonder if the Church has even been in favor of anything other than pain.  It also glosses over the fact that the research here was perfected on dogs, yet doesn't even pose the question of whether or not this is ethical.  I would say that it's probably not.  If we're all living things why are some allowed to be science experiments? When the Nazis did it to men we all screamed bloody murder, yet when we do it to man's best friend (in the same decade) we call it science.  In the end the black man is supposedly repaid for all the suffering the hospital put him through, but again I questioned whether or not this was fair payment.  More than anything this movie reminded me that college is a system that you pay into as opposed to some place where educational miracles are born.

However, with the great multitude of privileged doctors surrounding him, perhaps Blalock's most valuable asset was the work of his lab assistant, Vivien Thomas, a black man who was never given the chance to be a doctor, but was given, by Blalock, the opportunity to help develop revolutionary techniques that would save countless lives.Something the Lord Made, a film made for HBO, tells this story from Vivien's perspective, which is radically different from the story that was told at the time by the international media. Mos Def plays Vivien, and does a wonderful job in making Vivien a real person, instead of an idealistic caricature, who doesn't make much money, but isn't satisfied making more money elsewhere, because he really enjoys the field of medicine. Alan Rickman plays Dr. Blalock and adds an atrocious southern accent to an otherwise stable performance.Vivien Thomas, a carpenter by trade, has been saving for medical school for several years, when he comes across the opportunity to be a janitor in the lab of Dr. Alfred Blalock, a young research doctor who experiments on dogs in order to find a way to perform surgery to repair defective hearts, an operation that has been deemed impossible by most experts. Vivien shows some interest and more than a little knowledge of medicine, and soon Blalock has given him a white coat and they work side by side in the lab, challenging one another along the way. When Blalock gets a new job as head of surgery at Johns Hopkins, he insists that Vivien come along with him.The doctors at Hopkins are very slow to accept Vivien, a black man, into their world, but he slowly gains their respect through his extensive knowledge and calm demeanor. There are still skeptics, however, and Vivien wonders whether Blalock is treating him as an equal or just using him to further his own career and accomplishments. After they perform the first surgery together, Vivien isn't even allowed to be in the pictures taken for the magazines.This is a good made-for-TV movie, but not up to the standards of a theatrical release. The dialogue is all medically accurate, I am told, but when they are not talking medicine, the characters aren't given much interesting to say. As I stated before, the performances are solid, with Mos Def shining most brightly, but Alan Rickman really needs to stick to British characters, because more often than not, his accent was just distracting.

Middleton,"[10, 11]","This is a quality HBO production about two extraordinary men who developed a new technique in heart surgery, (In fact heart surgery had never been done before) creating by-passes to the heart, in this case, the condition of `blue babies', where not enough blood or oxygen reaches the heart of the child, thus causing the skin to turn blue. This was a fatal condition before this surgical technique was developed. One can imagine that it is difficult enough operating on a full grown, adult heart, but the first by-pass surgery was done on an infant, which makes the event that much more incredible.Alan Rickman plays the famous Dr. Alfred Blalock, whose approach to medicine generally extended beyond the received wisdom, forging ahead in to new areas and known for taking risks in the development of modern surgical medicine.Mos Def put in an incredible performance as the famous African American, Vivien Thomas, once a skilled carpenter, to then discover his natural gift for surgery and medicine in general.Since this groundbreaking surgery was performed, literally thousands of lives have been saved across the planet, thanks to the skill and determination of an educated and gifted researcher and a special autodidact, a man naturally skilled in surgery and a deep passion for the profession.The film depicts the entrenched and generally accepted racism and social segregation at the time, shown with Vivien Thomas's constant battle against unfounded prejudice while working with Dr. Blalock at John Hopkins. However despite this racism, Thomas became an invaluable teacher at John Hopkins and finally, after the death of Dr. Blalock, was given the accolades, an honorary doctorate, and included as one of the great teachers and surgeons at the world famous hospital.Is there humility in utter greatness? Well, to say the least, Vivien Thomas was terribly humble and extremely intelligent and, as the film implies, was the central contributor to the development of bypass surgery.

This movie is about the birth of cardiac surgery and how the great surgeon Dr. Alfred Blalock came to perform the first heart surgery on the blue baby, Eileen Saxon, in 1944.  It is also the story, and primarily the story of the great Vivien Thomas, an African-American, a surgical technician who was Dr. Blalock's assistant.Thomas wanted to be a doctor, but his precarious finances were made impossible by the Great Depression.  He was grateful to be hired as a janitor by Blalock.  It wasn't long before Thomas' brilliance was appreciated by those who knew him, but the racist attitudes of those years prevented his great genius from being presented to and appreciated by the general public until much later.Dr. Helen Taussig suggested a way to treat blue baby syndrome to Blalock who involved Thomas in researching the arterial shunt suggested by Taussig.  Thomas first developed the way to create the syndrome in dogs and then developed the way of relieving it with the shunt.  After a great deal of work with dogs, Thomas taught the procedure to Blalock and it was Blalock who did the first surgery in 1944.  Thomas could not perform the surgery because he wasn't a doctor and he did not get public acknowledgement for his contribution for decades.Still, acknowledgement did come, and we are all better for knowing about this genius, the life Thomas led and the contributions he made.  Mos Def is brilliant as the quiet and dignified Thomas.  It is a subtle and moving performance.  Watch the details of the actor's characterization and how he adds so much depth to this portrayal of Thomas.Alan Rickman is also fabulous as Dr. Blalock.  Here is a brilliant surgeon with the ego that cardiac surgeons have (need to have) in order to brave the challenge of taking their patients to the brink of death in order to give them life.  I enjoy the interactions between Blalock and Thomas.  Blalock is clearly a good man.  He braves much opposition to have Thomas in the surgical theater, but he is also a man of his time.  Blalock does not directly participate in the racial attitudes of his era, but he doesn't take his challenge of them beyond bringing Thomas in when he needs him.This movie is full of wonderful moments that I never tire of seeing.  The other characters add to the richness of the movie, but it is the performances of Mos Def and Alan Rickman that make this movie the treasure it is.Strongly and enthusiastically recommended.",5,A movie I enjoy seeing repreatedly,1156377600,"08 24, 2006",2006,2635,"['want', 'see', 'movie', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'story', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'lived', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'who', 'did', 'important', 'things', 'still', 'have', 'impact', 'world', 'inhabit', 'movie', 'birth', 'cardiac', 'surgery', 'how', 'great', 'surgeon', 'Dr.', 'Alfred', 'Blalock', 'came', 'perform', 'first', 'heart', 'surgery', 'blue', 'baby', 'Eileen', 'Saxon', '1944', 'also', 'story', 'primarily', 'story', 'great', 'Vivien', 'Thomas', 'African-American', 'surgical', 'technician', 'who', 'was', 'Dr.', 'Blalock', 'assistant.Thomas', 'wanted', 'be', 'doctor', 'precarious', 'finances', 'were', 'made', 'impossible', 'Great', 'Depression', 'was', 'grateful', 'be', 'hired', 'janitor', 'Blalock', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Thomas', 'brilliance', 'was', 'appreciated', 'who', 'knew', 'racist', 'attitudes', 'years', 'prevented', 'great', 'genius', 'being', 'presented', 'appreciated', 'general', 'public', 'much', 'later.Dr', 'Helen', 'Taussig', 'suggested', 'way', 'treat', 'blue', 'baby', 'syndrome', 'Blalock', 'who', 'involved', 'Thomas', 'researching', 'arterial', 'shunt', 'suggested', 'Taussig', 'Thomas', 'first', 'developed', 'way', 'create', 'syndrome', 'dogs', 'then', 'developed', 'way', 'relieving', 'shunt', 'great', 'deal', 'work', 'dogs', 'Thomas', 'taught', 'procedure', 'Blalock', 'was', 'Blalock', 'who', 'did', 'first', 'surgery', '1944', 'Thomas', 'could', 'not', 'perform', 'surgery', 'was', ""n't"", 'doctor', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'public', 'acknowledgement', 'contribution', 'decades.Still', 'acknowledgement', 'did', 'come', 'are', 'better', 'knowing', 'genius', 'life', 'Thomas', 'led', 'contributions', 'made', 'Mos', 'Def', 'brilliant', 'quiet', 'dignified', 'Thomas', 'subtle', 'moving', 'performance', 'Watch', 'details', 'actor', 'characterization', 'how', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'portrayal', 'Thomas.Alan', 'Rickman', 'also', 'fabulous', 'Dr.', 'Blalock', 'Here', 'brilliant', 'surgeon', 'ego', 'cardiac', 'surgeons', 'have', 'need', 'have', 'order', 'brave', 'challenge', 'taking', 'patients', 'brink', 'death', 'order', 'give', 'life', 'enjoy', 'interactions', 'Blalock', 'Thomas', 'Blalock', 'clearly', 'good', 'man', 'much', 'opposition', 'have', 'Thomas', 'surgical', 'theater', 'also', 'man', 'time', 'Blalock', 'not', 'directly', 'participate', 'racial', 'attitudes', 'era', ""n't"", 'take', 'challenge', 'bringing', 'Thomas', 'when', 'him.This', 'movie', 'full', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'never', 'tire', 'seeing', 'other', 'characters', 'add', 'richness', 'movie', 'performances', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'make', 'movie', 'treasure', 'is.Strongly', 'enthusiastically', 'recommended']",Something the Lord Made

I don't like to give spoilers, but if you have issues with animal experimentation this movie isn't for you.  If you understand the medical necessity in it, and take it as that, then this is a great movie about the beginning of open heart surgery for the treatment of Tetralogy of Fallot and how racial prejudice could have easily delayed or even prevented this procedure.My only criticism is the use of foul language during one of characters temper tantrums.  I don't think it was necessary and it almost seemed out of character for Dr. Blalock, at least the way Mr. Rickman portrayed the character...it seemed almost ""forced"".  It could have been a great family movie with the deletion of the obscenities as this could be a springboard for the discussion of racial issues, animal experimentation and even critically ill children.

862647,A11PTCZ2FM2547,B00067BCBI,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[2, 3]","The hallmark of a great film, in my humble opinion, is its ability to stop us dead in our tracks.  This is twofold:  First, the film has the uncanny ability to make us stop whatever we're doing, when we come across it on cable, to watch; and second, the ability to absorb us totally and completely into the story.  Such is the case with director Joseph Sargent's SOMETHING THE LORD MADE.Based on true events, this is the story of Dr. Alfred Blalock and Vivien Thomas, two pioneers in the field of cardiac surgery.  Dr. Blalock is obnoxious and high on ego; yet he also has dedicated his career to saving lives--in particular, ""blue babies"", the tiny infants with heart abnormalities preventing the flow of oxygen, thus usually leading to their deaths.  Blalock hires Thomas, a quiet and unassuming African-American man, as a janitor in his lab at Vanderbilt, yet it soon becomes apparent to the surgeon that Thomas is a medical genius; soon Vivien is promoted to lab technician (although still receiving a janitor's pay), where he becomes indispensable to Blalock's ongoing research into open heart surgery--a very risky proposition in the 1940s.  Once the surgery is successfully performed at Johns Hopkins University it is Dr. Blalock who receives all the credit and accolades, while Thomas, a perpetual victim of Jim Crow, is ignored or shunned.  Even Blalock himself refuses to publicly acknowledge Thomas, leading to a tension that temporarily ends their association.  Yet in the end, many years later, Thomas receives his overdue recognition at Johns Hopkins, in one of the most moving scenes you'll ever experience.Quite frankly, for the most part, I find Alan Rickman annoying; yet as Dr. Blalock he is absolutely convincing and believable as the gruff, no-nonsense surgeon.  And Mos Def is a most effective counterpart as the quiet, patient Thomas--a man yearning for one of humanity's most vital emotional needs:  recognition.  Meanwhile, director Sargent vividly recreates the sights and sounds of medical experiments and primitive surgery, which again immerses the viewer into the story.

862650,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B00067BCBI,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[8, 10]","""Something the Lord Made"" was written by Peter Silverman and Robert Caswell and directed by Joseph Sargent.  It is an inspiring film that was based in part on a magazine article by Katie McCabe who derived her material from a true story.  The movie stars the great British actor, Alan Rickman, who adopts a southern accent for his role as an ambitious and imperious surgeon and medical researcher named Dr. Alfred Blalock.  Blalock hires a black man, Vivien Thomas, underplayed beautifully by Mos Def, to do odd jobs around his lab.  Much to Dr. Blalock's shock, Vivien is not only incredibly skilled with his hands, but he picks up medical knowledge like a sponge and would like to become a doctor himself.  Soon Vivien becomes an indispensible assistant to Blalock, who learns to respect the young man's dedication, intuition, and creativity.The story begins in the thirties, when opportunities for bright young African-Americans were few, and Thomas is thrilled to be involved in important and involving work.  However, as the years pass, he begins to resent the fact that he is perpetually relegated to the status of a second class citizen and he finds it impossible to support a wife and children on the low wages that he receives.Alan Rickman plays Dr. Blalock as an arrogant, self-centered, and short-tempered individual who is anxious to be a pioneer in medical research.  He gets the chance to do just that when he and Vivien come up with a plan to perform heart surgery, an unprecendented operation that most doctors considered impossible. Mos Def imbues Thomas with quiet intelligence and dignity, and he is genuinely touching as a man whose wounded pride gets in the way of his willingness to perform the job he loves.The film's main weakness lies in its unsubtle treatment of institutional racism and reactionary hospital administrators. Kyra Sedgwick plays the stock role of Dr. Blalock's wife, Mary, a beautiful and long-suffering spouse who rarely sees her busy husband.  Gabrielle Union is the sugary sweet Clara Thomas, Vivien Thomas's supportive and patient wife. Mary Stuart Masterson is the hearing-impaired Dr. Helen Taussig, a caring and tenacious physician who first gives Blalock the idea of operating on ""blue babies.""In spite of its few flaws, ""Something the Lord Made"" is worth seeing for its unfliching look at an unusual collaboration between two very different men who shared a passion for saving lives.  It is also a history lesson about the days when heart surgery was unthinkable and when talented men of color were relegated to a secondary and unheralded role in medicine.",4,"""We changed the world.""",1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,2607,"['Something', 'Lord', 'Made', 'was', 'written', 'Peter', 'Silverman', 'Robert', 'Caswell', 'directed', 'Joseph', 'Sargent', 'inspiring', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'part', 'magazine', 'article', 'Katie', 'McCabe', 'who', 'derived', 'material', 'true', 'story', 'movie', 'great', 'British', 'actor', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'who', 'southern', 'accent', 'role', 'ambitious', 'imperious', 'surgeon', 'medical', 'researcher', 'named', 'Dr.', 'Alfred', 'Blalock', 'Blalock', 'black', 'man', 'Vivien', 'Thomas', 'underplayed', 'beautifully', 'Mos', 'Def', 'do', 'odd', 'jobs', 'lab', 'Much', 'Dr.', 'Blalock', 'shock', 'Vivien', 'not', 'only', 'incredibly', 'skilled', 'hands', 'up', 'medical', 'knowledge', 'sponge', 'would', 'like', 'become', 'doctor', 'Soon', 'Vivien', 'indispensible', 'assistant', 'Blalock', 'who', 'respect', 'young', 'man', 'dedication', 'intuition', 'creativity.The', 'story', 'thirties', 'when', 'opportunities', 'bright', 'young', 'African-Americans', 'were', 'few', 'Thomas', 'thrilled', 'be', 'involved', 'important', 'involving', 'work', 'However', 'years', 'pass', 'resent', 'fact', 'perpetually', 'relegated', 'status', 'second', 'class', 'citizen', 'impossible', 'support', 'wife', 'children', 'low', 'wages', 'Rickman', 'Dr.', 'Blalock', 'arrogant', 'self-centered', 'short-tempered', 'individual', 'who', 'anxious', 'be', 'pioneer', 'medical', 'research', 'chance', 'do', 'just', 'when', 'Vivien', 'come', 'up', 'plan', 'perform', 'heart', 'surgery', 'unprecendented', 'operation', 'most', 'doctors', 'considered', 'impossible', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Thomas', 'quiet', 'intelligence', 'dignity', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'man', 'wounded', 'pride', 'way', 'willingness', 'perform', 'job', 'film', 'main', 'weakness', 'unsubtle', 'treatment', 'institutional', 'racism', 'reactionary', 'hospital', 'administrators', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'stock', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Blalock', 'wife', 'Mary', 'beautiful', 'long-suffering', 'spouse', 'who', 'rarely', 'busy', 'husband', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'sugary', 'sweet', 'Clara', 'Thomas', 'Vivien', 'Thomas', 'supportive', 'patient', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'hearing-impaired', 'Dr.', 'Helen', 'Taussig', 'caring', 'tenacious', 'physician', 'who', 'first', 'Blalock', 'idea', 'operating', 'blue', 'babies', 'spite', 'few', 'flaws', 'Something', 'Lord', 'Made', 'worth', 'seeing', 'unfliching', 'look', 'unusual', 'collaboration', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'men', 'who', 'shared', 'passion', 'saving', 'lives', 'also', 'history', 'lesson', 'days', 'when', 'heart', 'surgery', 'was', 'unthinkable', 'when', 'talented', 'men', 'color', 'were', 'relegated', 'secondary', 'unheralded', 'role', 'medicine']",Something the Lord Made
862651,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B00067BCBI,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[3, 3]","In 1930, Vivien Thomas is an unemployed carpenter when a friend gets a position for him at Vanderbilt University Hospital. He must clean the dog kennels for Alfred Blaylock, M.D. surgeon, overbearing, supremely confident descendent of Jefferson Davis and racist by today's standards.It isn't long before he notices that Thomas is reading his medical books and he begins pushing him to operate on research anmimals, which he does with singular skill.  In twelve years, Doctor Blaylock's research in shock and trauma earns him a position as head of surgery at Johns Hopkins in MD. He turns down a position in Michigan because they will not accept his lab assistant, and Blayock will go nowhere without Vivien Thomas.Enter Doctor Taussig a medical doctor who meets Blaylock in his home where Vivien Thomas is serving drinks to his guests. She asks the good doctor to pioneer a surgical procedure for ""blue babies,"" so called because they do not have enough blood flow to the extremities. While Mr. Thomas is serving drinks and listening to the conversation, he is adding his two medical cents to his mentor. With more curiosity and respect than pique, she demands, ""Who are you?"" Dr. Taussig and other guests like Drs. Denton Cooley and William P. Longmire will soon learn of Thomas's knowledge and skill.As in real life, Thomas helps Blaylock overcome the dictum, ""do not touch the heart."" He creates special clamps, stitches, and procedure for blue baby operations. Thomas has the magical ability to operate with his eyes closed. He will assist the ground-breaking operation of open-heart surgery, but will not get any of the credit.Heartbroken and feeling betrayed by the exclusion, Thomas tries to pursue college and a new career without success. He humbles himself returning to Doctor Blaylock where he teaches residents surgery. He finally receives an honorary degree that doesn't quite match the level of respect and admiration that hospital staff have for his achievement and skill.There's nothing like a good book, but there is also nothing like a good movie. Alan Rickman plays Dr. Blaylock superbly. Very progressive by World War II standards, he is woefully bigoted by today's, and is perplexed at Thomas' disappointment in him. Mos Def too, plays the respectful and self-respecting Vivien Thomas to perfection. He will not tolerate Dr. Blaylock's temper tantrum and returns money to another doctor who insists he get coffee and a donut for him. Both play from a superb script. The single piano as background was the perfect accompaniment to the triumphs, disappointments, frustration, and sadness of the show.

Such a decision rubber stamps the importance of these 'small films' and makes them available to the general public.Such is certainly the case for SOMETHING THE LORD MADE which is a tender epistle about the growth of trust and bonding between two men for the good of science and mankind.  Dr. Alfred Blalock (Alan Rickman) is a cardiovascular surgeon whose importance in the field of medicine is still being recognized.  An early pioneer in the hemodynamics of vascular and cardiac surgery, this brief portion of his life focuses on his benevolence in hiring a bright but impoverished young African American Vivien Thomas (Mos Def) and through a recognition of the latter's fine mind and bright spirit, bonds in a way that for the day was completely dissonant to the rest of racially prejudiced America.How these two men finessed the surgery for a congenital disorder of the great vessels of the heart which had always meant death to those born with this Tetralogy of Fallot before Blalock and Thomas intervened is but one aspect of this sensitive film.  The even more important statement is the one of racial equality that preceded many other more famous movements.  Much of the power of this film is in the portrayals of Mos Def and Alan Rickman who are both brilliant in their interpretations.  This is a subtle film and one that is greatly enhanced by a superb supporting cast and the capable direction by Joseph Sargent.  Simply stated, this is one of those films that everyone should see.

(Alan Rickman & Mos Def.) Surounded by prejudice, discrimination & racism; the two men learned to respect, and to ultimately benefit from their differences for the good of all. They developed the heart surgery shunt technique to prolong life for 'blue babies.' Although that's what the plot is about, it's not what the story is...I shouldn't have liked this - not a fan of HBO 'original' movies, nor rap stars turned actors. Great movies are made by studios or independents, not networks. Great actors come from the world of acting; not singing, photography or sports. But the description sounded interesting, so I gave it a chance... WOW.Excellent story, very fine acting, authentic looking cinematography, compelling and well-developed screenplay; and a real zing for your heartstrings. The particular subject matter is interesting enough, but the real story is the human relationships, both within/among the characters & American society. As we travailed through the growing pains of integration and striving for equality whether by race, gender or social class distinction; the story of how we coped and progressed has seldom been depicted with such artistic clarity.Also, a real Believe In Yourself, Do What You Love, Don't Give Up kind of story. Not a perfect film, might seem a bit slow-paced at times for some, but very engrossing. Along with the lead actors who portrayed their characters wonderfully, Kyra Sedgwick also turned in another fine appearance. Watching it unfold it was easy to become involved, by the end I was very pleasantly surprised to be reminded that the brilliant young leading man was Mos Def.

862671,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00067BCBI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[155, 169]","For me the worst bigots are not the ones who carry shotguns and engage in lynchings.  Underneath their hatred is a fear born from knowing in the marrow of their bones that they are not as good as the people they are oppressing and that on an equal playing field they will be the ones who end up on the bottom.  I am always outraged more by those bigots whose racism is embodied in what they say and how they say it, as well as by the gestures they demand to keep Jim Crow in place despite the evidence of their eyes and the assumption what they see actually gets into their brains.  In ""Something the Lord Made,"" there is a moment where a white doctor at the most prestigious hospital in the country makes a point of leaving his office and go into a laboratory just to have a black man fetch food and drink.  I look at such a man and wonder what he is thinking, knowing that whatever it is, it is just not right.Racism is the subtext of ""Something the Lord Made,"" an HBO movie that dramatizes the story first told in the ""American Experience"" documentary ""Partners of the Heart.""  This is the story of Dr. Alfred Blalock, who pioneered cardiac surgery in 1944 when he and Dr. Helen Taussig developed the Blalock-Taussig technique, a surgical procedure that repaired the faulty blood vessel in the hearts of babies that was causing a lack of oxygen.  This fatal birth defect turned babies a light shade of blue, resulting in their being commonly called ""blue babies"" (Fallot's tetralogy).  The story of ""Something the Lord Made"" is about not only this pioneering medical work, but also the relationship between Blalock and Vivien Thomas, a lab technician. Blalock (Alan Rickman) is white and Thomas is black (Mos Def), which is why racism keeps rearing its head throughout the tale.Blalock is a brilliant but brash physician doing pioneering work on the treatment of hemorrhagic and traumatic shock (Blalock demonstrated that surgical shock resulted primarily from the loss of blood, and therefore encouraged the use of plasma or whole-blood transfusions as treatment).  Thomas has been saving his money to go to medical school but has been working as a carpenter's assistant when he gets a job sweeping and cleaning Blalock's laboratory and dog kennels (experimental techniques are developed working on dogs, once a condition comparable to what is found in humans is created).  But the doctor quickly discovers that Thomas has a quick and inventive mind and the Great Depression ends Thomas' dream of going to medical school.  What starts off as a relationship between master and servant (or at least boss and employee), becomes that of teacher and student.  By the time Blalock moves to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and takes Thomas with him, the two have become joined at the brain.  There is a delightful scene where Blalock is kicking around ideas with his new colleagues and Thomas keeps making comments and bouncing ideas off the doctor until they are involved in an intense discussion and everybody is watching dumbfounded.Director Joseph Sargent (""Colossus: The Forbin Project,"" ""Miss Evers' Boys"") has two major stories to tell here.  One is the medical story of the invention of cardiac surgery and the other is the human story of whether Vivien Thomas would ever be recognized for his invaluable assistance in that effort.  Thomas does the work of a lab technician, but is paid as a janitor.  He has to use the back entrance at Johns Hopkins when he comes to work and students flock to see the great Dr. Blalock assisting Thomas when operating on a dog.  Even after they achieve their greatest success, there are colleagues who laugh at Blalock because he needed Thomas' help to do the impossible, their bigotry making it impossible for them to realize doing the impossible is no mean feat.There are social victories along the way.  Not so much that Blalock is finally persuaded to do something about his invaluable assistant's salary as the young doctors who come up to Thomas and ask if they can work with him in their spare time (although their accents are invariably not of the south).  But Blalock is getting his picture on the cover of ""Life"" and the only one in the operating theater not in the group photographs are Thomas and the nurse, and there is an element of sadness that it was over a decade after Blalock died that Thomas received his overdue recognition.  Was Blalock's problem that he was egotistical or that the man was so focused?  The film suggests it was the latter and that the work was what mattered.  Indeed, the most memorable scene in this 2004 film is when we see with our own eyes the miracle that Blalock, Thomas, Taussig, and these others wrought in 1944.""Something the Lord Made"" won the 2004 Emmy for outstanding made-for-TV movie, due in part to the marvelously understated performances by Rickman and Def.  The DVD includes audio commentary by Sargent, writer Peter Silverman, and producers Robert W. Cort and Eric Hetzel.  The featurette on the making of the film and historical slide show both get into some of the true story, which is worth pursuing on its own.  The frail child on whom the operation was first performed died months later during a second operation.  But the film does make it clear that she was very ill and a high-risk patient to begin with, who was doomed to die, and what happened at Johns Hopkins in 1944 did prove the surgical procedure worked well enough to end up saving the lives of tens of thousands of children.  So there are more aspects of this fascinating story that have been left untold that you can certainly find out more about.",5,A superb mixture of medical and human drama from HBO,1109980800,"03 5,

I don't know what the competition was but this is one of my favorite movies and deserves any awards it receives. It is the true story of Dr. Alfred Blalock and Vivian Thomas. The film begins in the 1930's when  white heart surgeon Blalock hires Thomas, an African American, as the janitor in his medical lab. Thomas takes home textbooks at night and teaches himself medicine. He is also very skilled with his hands and wants to pursue a career as a surgeon but America is not a friendly environment for blacks who want to achieve in the scholastic world, especially the world of medicine. It soon becomes apparent to Blalock what a genius Thomas is and what a skilled surgeon he could make. While Thomas perfects a new technique that saves thousands of infant lives (still in use today I understand), Blalock gets all the credit. The acting is outstanding and the story will bring tears to your eyes. It's still hard to believe this was America 50 to 60 years ago. A great movie. Too bad it never made it to the theaters. Other than some brief, rough language on the part of Dr. Blalock this is a very family friendly film, one you will want to watch more than once. Better yet - buy several for family & friends.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[21, 22]","Vivien Thomas would have been on his way to medical school if not for the stock market crash of 1929 wiping out the Thomas' finances.  A skilled carpenter trained by his father, Vivien took work in the research lab of surgeon Alfred Blalock.The partnership was magic.  Blalock had been a disappointment of sorts.  Although he graduated from Johns Hopkins, he didn't get his desired residency in surgery there, and after three years he left Baltimore to become the first surgery resident at Vanderbilt in Nashville.Blalock had ideas about treatment of shock due to trauma - the now common sense plan of blood transfusion - and his research led to the saving of untold lives in World War II (and beyond). As a result of his new fame he was offered the position of Chief of Surgery at Johns Hopkins.  He brought along Vivien Thomas.The achievements of Dr. Blalock are suitably shown in this movie, but the film wisely focuses on Thomas and on their relationship.  Without a single day as a medical student, Thomas uses his innate intelligence and abilities so well that he becomes the lab extension of Blalock's research.  While Blalock is off being Chief of Surgery, Thomas is in the lab, devising new surgical techniques on dogs.  The movie by-passes the technique Blalock and Thomas devised for treatment of coarctation of the aorta.Dr. Helen Taussig is a pediatric cardiologist at Hopkins who cares for those unfortunate children born with ""blue baby syndrome"" - Tetrology of Fallot - with a severely narrowed pulmonary artery (carrying blood to the lungs from the heart) and a hole in the wall between the right and left ventricles of the heart (allowing already poorly oxygenated blood to bypass the body).  She approaches Blalock and the Blalock-Thomas team go to work trying to reproduce the condition in the laboratory so that they can devise a means to treat it.  (Historical records show that it could have been any one of the three who came up with the idea).So while Vivien Thomas is doing the bulk of the lab work that will eventually bring Dr. Blalock world-wide fame, he is being paid as a ""class 3"" employee (the pay scale for custodial workers) at Hopkins because he is black.  He isn't even allowed to enter his building through the front door.The film doesn't gloss over the fact that racism holds Thomas in his place when his own intelligence and abilities have made him in every way Blalock's colleague.  It also doesn't gloss over the fact that Blalock did little to correct things for his colleague.Alan Rickman portrays Blalock and Mos Def gives an astonishing performance as Thomas.

So much the better for HBO I guess.  The story is about the doctors who pioneered the technics for heart surgery.  It was thought back then that you could not operate on the heart.  Dr. Blalock thought otherwise.  Vivien Thomas was a carpenters son and was very skilled at his trade.  After losing his job he finds a job cleaning the lab for Dr. Blalock who was working on shock syndrome.  He used dogs for his research.  Blalock soon discovered that Thomas had skills beyond that of a carpenter.It is said that Alan Rickman who played Dr. Blalock in the movie balked at saying the line ""this is like Something the Lord made.""  He thought is was corny having to say the title of the movie as dialogue.  I beg to differ.  When you think of the line within the context of Vivien Thomas, a truer word was never spoken.  Indeed, Thomas was something the Lord made.  God made Vivien Thomas a doctor even though he never went to medical school.  You've seen that happen before.  A pianist who can't read music, a painter who never took art lessons, a preacher who never went to seminary school, etc.Mos Def (he should buy himself a new name now) plays Thomas and he is brilliant in this role.  I don't know if he'll ever do anything as wonderful as this again.  He is a natural.  Seems that the Lord made him an actor:)  Def has great instincts and great timing.  I was highly impressed.  If you watch the film closely, you will notice that he changes his body language and voice 3 times as the character ages.  Mos Def seems to play a spot on image of Thomas who played things close to the vest and was not prone to outbursts or fits of temper even when he became angry.You must view this film.  It's heart breaking to watch Blalock and the other doctors get their picture taken for a magazine while Thomas stands in the background with no recognition at all even though Blalock called him into the O.R. to talk him through the procedure.I won't tell you what happens at the end but you'll be happy with the end results.  Please, please, please don't miss this one. I must commend HBO.  It seems as though they are the only company that produces african american themed films on a regular basis.

These two doctors' work in conjunction with Dr. Helen Taussig in as well as emergency surgeries begun in World War II gave rise to the discipline of cardiology.Vivien Thomas began working for Dr. Alfred Blalock in 1929 at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, TN.  At the time, Blalock was studying trauma. Blalock and Thomas together developed the procedure to transfuse blood to restore life to trauma patients.That work took the pair of them to Johns Hopkins where the Dr. Blalock was challenged by Dr. Taussig to help 'blue babies.' The two pioneered both the instruments and techniques including sutures that 'grow' that enabled blue babies to live.It's no surprise this film won an Emmy in 2004.  ""Something the Lord Made"" is a fascinating historical depiction of a pioneering time in our history both scientifically and racially.  Both Mos Def and Alan Rickman did an excellent job in their roles, literally losing their own persona in their acting.",5,"""Where others see risk, I see opportunities...""",1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,1225,"['2004', 'made', 'television', 'film', 'details', 'lives', 'Drs', 'Vivien', 'Thomas', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Alfred', 'Blalock', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'who', 'are', 'pioneers', 'field', 'cardiac', 'surgery.Prior', '1940', 'was', 'theorized', 'touching', 'human', 'heart', 'would', 'result', 'instant', 'death', 'two', 'doctors', 'work', 'conjunction', 'Dr.', 'Helen', 'Taussig', 'as', 'well', 'emergency', 'surgeries', 'begun', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'gave', 'rise', 'discipline', 'cardiology.Vivien', 'Thomas', 'began', 'working', 'Dr.', 'Alfred', 'Blalock', '1929', 'Vanderbilt', 'Medical', 'Center', 'Nashville', 'TN', 'time', 'Blalock', 'was', 'studying', 'trauma', 'Blalock', 'Thomas', 'together', 'developed', 'procedure', 'transfuse', 'blood', 'restore', 'life', 'trauma', 'patients.That', 'work', 'took', 'pair', 'Johns', 'Hopkins', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Blalock', 'was', 'challenged', 'Dr.', 'Taussig', 'help', ""'blue"", 'babies', 'two', 'pioneered', 'instruments', 'techniques', 'including', 'sutures', ""'grow"", 'enabled', 'blue', 'babies', 'live.It', 'surprise', 'film', 'won', 'Emmy', '2004', 'Something', 'Lord', 'Made', 'fascinating', 'historical', 'depiction', 'pioneering', 'time', 'history', 'scientifically', 'racially', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'roles', 'literally', 'losing', 'own', 'persona', 'acting']",Something the Lord Made

Leo TolstoyTrue story: 1940s Vanderbilt surgeon Alfred Blalock (Alan Rickman) hired carpenter Vivien Thomas (Mos Def) in his dog research lab. Thomas impresses Blalock with his rapid intellect, curiosity, manual dexterity, humor and inventive flexibility.Blalock takes Thomas with him North to Johns Hopkins. Dr. Taussig, noted for her ability to diagnose via palpation instead of auscultation, brings a blue baby destined to die within 6 months to Blalock. Blalock and Thomas wrestle to recreate a model of a blue baby in the dog Anna (now immortalized in a portrait at Johns Hopkins) and then cure the cyanosis.A friend who worked with us at the Gallup Indian Hospital in 1971 suffered the loss of his first born, a son, to Transposition of the Great Arteries, blue baby syndrome.Surgical dogma at the time proscribed touching the heart. Blalock and Thomas broke tradition as a mixed race medical teaching partnership during the era of segregation, pioneered heart surgery on an infant, created new surgical techniques and invented ground breaking miniature instrumentation.5 star inspiring true story of risking on the frontiers of medicine to offer guidance for generations of physicians and hope for families.I had the good fortune to do research under John Norman, MD surgeon, on a totally implantible artificial heart at Boston City Hospital in the 60s. Dr Norman moved to Texas to work with Denton Cooley on the Abdominal Left Ventricular Assist Device. Dr Cooley was one of Dr Blalock and Dr Thomas' residents.It is important to teach children kindness and simplicity in life and work.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[1, 1]","People like Adrianne of ""America's Next Top Model"" want to do away with Black History Month and anything centering around honoring Black people regardless of all of the holidays, streets, buildings, and stamps that honor those of other cultures.  However, what she does not seem to realize is that without months like these, it is much harder for the African American community to be able to learn about the lesser known heroes in African American culture in an educational environment. I went almost 25 years without knowing Vivien Thomas' name, and it took a trip to a Jena 6 rally in simple conversation to even hear about this film. I'm disappointed that Hollywood would not take this movie to major theaters for others to find out, specifically potential African American surgeons who are students now.  The fact that this movie could not reach broader audiences by being a major film is disappointing, but I applaud HBO for embracing it enough to let the movie be seen on their station.This movie is about a young, aspiring African American male, Vivien Thomas, who would like to become a heart surgeon and practice medicine some day.  Because a bank is closed, for whatever reason, he was never able to get the money he'd saved for over a decade to go to medical school. Taking a maintenance position with a well-known White doctor, Alfred Blalock, the two team up to become very successful at the first heart surgery for ""blue babies"" in the middle of Jim Crow law days. Movies like this are essential in African American culture, and I was very impressed by how the movie was written, produced, directed, and acted.  I loved Mos Def's role because I love him as an artist but moreso because I think he has turned out to be a phenomenal actor.  I hope the Board of Education takes movies like this into consideration during February and any other month of the year so maybe Adrianne can get her wish to celebrate American history and African Americans can get their wish to see more of themselves in history books and onscreen in positive roles.",5,A Look At African American History And Medical History,1190764800,"09 26, 2007",2007,2053,"['People', 'Adrianne', 'America', 'Next', 'Top', 'Model', 'want', 'do', 'away', 'Black', 'History', 'Month', 'anything', 'centering', 'honoring', 'Black', 'people', 'regardless', 'holidays', 'streets', 'buildings', 'stamps', 'honor', 'other', 'cultures', 'However', 'what', 'not', 'seem', 'realize', 'months', 'much', 'harder', 'African', 'American', 'community', 'be', 'able', 'learn', 'lesser', 'known', 'heroes', 'African', 'American', 'culture', 'educational', 'environment', 'went', 'almost', '25', 'years', 'knowing', 'Vivien', 'Thomas', 'name', 'took', 'trip', 'Jena', '6', 'rally', 'simple', 'conversation', 'even', 'hear', 'film', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'not', 'take', 'movie', 'major', 'theaters', 'others', 'find', 'out', 'specifically', 'potential', 'African', 'American', 'surgeons', 'who', 'are', 'students', 'now', 'fact', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'reach', 'broader', 'audiences', 'being', 'major', 'film', 'disappointing', 'applaud', 'HBO', 'embracing', 'enough', 'let', 'movie', 'be', 'seen', 'station.This', 'movie', 'young', 'aspiring', 'African', 'American', 'male', 'Vivien', 'Thomas', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'become', 'heart', 'surgeon', 'practice', 'medicine', 'day', 'bank', 'closed', 'reason', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'get', 'money', ""'d"", 'saved', 'decade', 'go', 'medical', 'school', 'Taking', 'maintenance', 'position', 'well-known', 'White', 'doctor', 'Alfred', 'Blalock', 'two', 'team', 'up', 'become', 'very', 'successful', 'first', 'heart', 'surgery', 'blue', 'babies', 'middle', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'law', 'days', 'Movies', 'are', 'essential', 'African', 'American', 'culture', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'produced', 'directed', 'acted', 'loved', 'Mos', 'Def', 'role', 'love', 'artist', 'moreso', 'think', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'phenomenal', 'actor', 'hope', 'Board', 'Education', 'movies', 'consideration', 'February', 'other', 'month', 'year', 'so', 'maybe', 'Adrianne', 'can', 'get', 'wish', 'celebrate', 'American', 'history', 'African', 'Americans', 'can', 'get', 'wish', 'see', 'more', 'history', 'books', 'onscreen', 'positive', 'roles']",Something the Lord Made
862706,A39T7TMQXZ93YL,B00067BCBI,"Sithara Batcha ""Sithara""","[2, 3]","This movie is a gem:  It intertwines multiple stories together and does so brilliantly.At one level, it can be viewed as how the evolving relationship between two extraordinary people led to great medical advances.  There is the brilliant, brash short-tempered white surgeon Blalock and the equally brilliant, cool, calm, dignified Black janitor/student/technician/assistant/...(I won't give it away- watch the movie) Thomas.  These two opposing personalities recognize that they complement each other perfectly, and, develop a deep respect for each other. Working together they make extraordinary advances in medicine from discovering the nature and treatment for shock to performing the first heart surgery.On another level, the movie presents the realities of race relations in American History.  While Thomas and Blalock work as equals in the laboratory, on the outside world, things couldn't be more different.  While Blalock lives in a mansion, and gets lauded for 'his' advances at galas, the press and by the medical community, Thomas works extra jobs to pay rent, including serving as a waiter at Blalock's parties!  Its heartbreaking to see his contributions so thoroughly ignored by the outside world- he is not even included in the picture taken of first medical team to perform the surgery, is not included as an co-author in medical journal articles, and he is not invited to, much less acknowledged at, conferences and gatherings.  However, the advent of civil rights brings Thomas gradually increasing recognition, leading to the film's rich and incredibly gratifying ending.The film is often at is best when it shows the outside world of racism colliding with the collegial world of laboratory:  when Thomas, working as a waiter in Blalock's party, shocks the other physicians with his knowledge and insight during a discussion of possible surgery for the heart condition tetralogy of fallot, or when Blalock visits the Thomas family and gets an icy cold reception from Thomas' wife Clara for finally arranging for a raise for Thomas from a `maintenance worker' to a 'lab technician,' to the highlight of the movie where Blalock finds he just cannot perform his first heart surgery without Thomas at his side, regardless of the general surprise and snickering/denigration of some of his colleagues.Last but not least, this is also a movie about one of the extraordinary advances of medical science.  It is brilliantly done just from a medical history point of view.  Medical concepts are explained simply but without sacrificing accuracy.  Watching how Thomas and Blalock go from stage to stage- from creating a cardiovascular condition similar to tetralogy of fallot in a dog, to performing the first corrective procedures in dogs (with some tragic mishaps) to performing the first successful procedure in a baby girl is simply fascinating.  Indeed, watching baby Eileen's face turn from blue to pink upon success of the surgery- one feels that one has just witnessed a modern miracle.Indeed, it is something the Lord made possible, working through the minds and hands of two extraordinary men from two very different worlds.",5,Simply Extraordinary,1150070400,"06 12, 2006",2006,3143,"['movie', 'gem', 'multiple', 'stories', 'together', 'so', 'brilliantly.At', 'one', 'level', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'how', 'evolving', 'relationship', 'two', 'extraordinary', 'people', 'led', 'great', 'medical', 'advances', 'brilliant', 'brash', 'short-tempered', 'white', 'surgeon', 'Blalock', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'cool', 'calm', 'dignified', 'Black', 'janitor/student/technician/assistant/', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away-', 'movie', 'Thomas', 'two', 'opposing', 'personalities', 'recognize', 'complement', 'other', 'perfectly', 'develop', 'deep', 'respect', 'other', 'Working', 'together', 'make', 'extraordinary', 'advances', 'medicine', 'discovering', 'nature', 'treatment', 'shock', 'performing', 'first', 'heart', 'surgery.On', 'level', 'movie', 'realities', 'race', 'relations', 'American', 'History', 'Thomas', 'Blalock', 'work', 'equals', 'laboratory', 'outside', 'world', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'different', 'Blalock', 'mansion', 'lauded', ""'his"", 'advances', 'galas', 'press', 'medical', 'community', 'Thomas', 'extra', 'jobs', 'pay', 'rent', 'including', 'serving', 'waiter', 'Blalock', 'parties', 'heartbreaking', 'see', 'contributions', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'ignored', 'outside', 'world-', 'not', 'even', 'included', 'picture', 'taken', 'first', 'medical', 'team', 'perform', 'surgery', 'not', 'included', 'co-author', 'medical', 'journal', 'articles', 'not', 'invited', 'much', 'less', 'acknowledged', 'conferences', 'gatherings', 'However', 'advent', 'civil', 'rights', 'Thomas', 'gradually', 'increasing', 'recognition', 'leading', 'film', 'rich', 'incredibly', 'gratifying', 'ending.The', 'film', 'often', 'best', 'when', 'outside', 'world', 'racism', 'colliding', 'collegial', 'world', 'laboratory', 'when', 'Thomas', 'working', 'waiter', 'Blalock', 'party', 'other', 'physicians', 'knowledge', 'insight', 'discussion', 'possible', 'surgery', 'heart', 'condition', 'tetralogy', 'fallot', 'when', 'Blalock', 'Thomas', 'family', 'icy', 'cold', 'reception', 'Thomas', 'wife', 'Clara', 'finally', 'arranging', 'raise', 'Thomas', 'maintenance', 'worker', ""'lab"", 'technician', 'highlight', 'movie', 'where', 'Blalock', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'perform', 'first', 'heart', 'surgery', 'Thomas', 'side', 'regardless', 'general', 'surprise', 'snickering/denigration', 'colleagues.Last', 'not', 'least', 'also', 'movie', 'one', 'extraordinary', 'advances', 'medical', 'science', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'just', 'medical', 'history', 'point', 'view', 'Medical', 'concepts', 'are', 'explained', 'simply', 'sacrificing', 'accuracy', 'Watching', 'how', 'Thomas', 'Blalock', 'go', 'stage', 'stage-', 'creating', 'cardiovascular', 'condition', 'similar', 'tetralogy', 'fallot', 'dog', 'performing', 'first', 'corrective', 'procedures', 'dogs', 'tragic', 'mishaps', 'performing', 'first', 'successful', 'procedure', 'baby', 'girl', 'simply', 'fascinating', 'Indeed', 'watching', 'baby', 'Eileen', 'face', 'turn', 'blue', 'pink', 'success', 'surgery-', 'one', 'one', 'just', 'witnessed', 'modern', 'miracle.Indeed', 'something', 'Lord', 'made', 'possible', 'working', 'minds', 'hands', 'two', 'extraordinary', 'men', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'worlds']",Something the Lord Made

But Thomas' remarkable manual dexterity and scientific acumen shatter Blalock's expectations, and Thomas rapidly becomes indispensable as a research partner to Blalock in his first daring forays into heart surgery. The film traces the groundbreaking work the two men undertake when they move in 1941 from Vanderbilt to Johns Hopkins, an institution where the only black employees are janitors and where Thomas must enter by the back door. Together, they boldly attack the devastating heart problem of Tetralogy of Fallot, also known as Blue Baby Syndrome, and in so doing they open the field of heart surgery. The movie dramatizes their race to save dying Blue Babies against the background of a Jim Crow (Racial Segregation) America, illuminating the nuanced and complex relationship the two sustain. Thomas earns Blalock's unalloyed respect, with Blalock praising the results of Thomas' surgical skill as being ""like something the Lord made"", and insisting that Thomas coach him through the first Blue Baby surgery over the protests of Hopkins administrators.

Bottom Line, this movie is about saving lives, Baby's Lives. And the road to saving those precious infant lives is full of failure, frustration, anger, unfairness and miracles.It's based on a true story and seems to accurately depict the racial attitude that existed in America during that time.  A lot goes on in the relationship between the two main characters, but as always in great movies, it's the things that are not said that make the story so captivating.  You get to see not only the growth of two men, but also the evolution of surgery and surgical procedures that have made a difference in how heart valve problems are treated today.Maybe those who griped about the movie were misled by the title. It's not about the son of God, but it does show the gift of God in the hands of human beings. What better gift for man than to be led to discovering a way to mend a newborn infant heart?I'd recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys seeing how with medicine and innovative medical procedures, doctors/surgeons have triumphed over many health defects to save patients lives.

""Something the Lord Made"" is based on the true events that led to cardiac surgery as we know it today.But there are two great stories here. One story is the fascinating process of discovery in medicine born of the partnership between the brilliant Dr. Alfred Blalock (played by Alan Rickman) and his no less brilliant laboratory technician, Vivien Thomas (played by Mos Def). The other story, no less fascinating, is of a white man and a black man in a partnership to bring oxygen to the heart ... metaphorically speaking. Their partnership takes place in the time when civil rights were still just a twinkle in Martin Luther King's eye, in the 1930's and 40's. Blalock is a risk-taking surgeon who runs a laboratory where he conducts his research, and he hires an African-American janitor with an interest in medicine. He promotes him to lab technician, but where there are moments when Blalock rises above bigotry and does what is right, there are also those moments when he conforms to the racism of the day. When he achieves success in developing the technique for a bypass on a ""blue baby,"" he publicly expresses his gratitude to every white man in the operating room, yet leaves Vivien Thomas unacknowledged. Blalock is in great measure a hero, defying the day, but not without his moments of failing the quiet man working beside him, bringing life to his heart in more ways than one. Much of the movie's intrigue is the movement of the two men toward and away from each other, in and apart from medicine.It is disappointing that this movie has not received greater acclaim. First shown as an HBO movie, it deserves the bigger screen. It shines an important light on innovation, the risk and determination needed to realize a great discovery, the taking of a higher road when the lower road would seem so much easier. We see a man rise above when he is forced to take the back entrance to John Hopkins, live on the pay of a janitor while perfecting operating techniques he can literally perform with his eyes closed, perform under surgical lights in a hospital where black men cannot be called on a PA system... because they are black. We see here a man do the work he loves, in spite of the lack of recognition, in spite of being ignored again and again, year upon year, brushed aside without credit. This is the greatness that happens when, and only when, a passion is followed through first and foremost because the work is worthy - not the applause.It is only when great work is done without considering applause, after all, that it deserves it. The ending, so long in coming, is deeply satisfying. It brings new oxygen to all human hearts.",5,Saving Heart,1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,2810,"['writer', 'editor', 'health', 'care', 'am', 'always', 'curious', 'learn', 'workings', 'indeed', 'miracles', 'happen', 'everyday', 'hospital', 'operating', 'rooms', 'Something', 'Lord', 'Made', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'led', 'cardiac', 'surgery', 'know', 'are', 'two', 'great', 'stories', 'here', 'One', 'story', 'fascinating', 'process', 'discovery', 'medicine', 'born', 'partnership', 'brilliant', 'Dr.', 'Alfred', 'Blalock', 'played', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'less', 'brilliant', 'laboratory', 'technician', 'Vivien', 'Thomas', 'played', 'Mos', 'Def', 'other', 'story', 'less', 'fascinating', 'white', 'man', 'black', 'man', 'partnership', 'bring', 'oxygen', 'heart', 'metaphorically', 'speaking', 'partnership', 'place', 'time', 'when', 'civil', 'rights', 'were', 'still', 'just', 'twinkle', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'eye', '1930', '40', 'Blalock', 'risk-taking', 'surgeon', 'who', 'laboratory', 'where', 'research', 'African-American', 'janitor', 'interest', 'medicine', 'lab', 'technician', 'where', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'Blalock', 'bigotry', 'what', 'right', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'when', 'racism', 'day', 'When', 'success', 'developing', 'technique', 'bypass', 'blue', 'baby', 'publicly', 'gratitude', 'white', 'man', 'operating', 'room', 'Vivien', 'Thomas', 'unacknowledged', 'Blalock', 'great', 'measure', 'hero', 'defying', 'day', 'not', 'moments', 'failing', 'quiet', 'man', 'working', 'bringing', 'life', 'heart', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'Much', 'movie', 'intrigue', 'movement', 'two', 'men', 'away', 'other', 'apart', 'medicine.It', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'not', 'received', 'greater', 'acclaim', 'First', 'shown', 'HBO', 'movie', 'bigger', 'screen', 'important', 'light', 'innovation', 'risk', 'determination', 'needed', 'realize', 'great', 'discovery', 'taking', 'higher', 'road', 'when', 'lower', 'road', 'would', 'seem', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'see', 'man', 'rise', 'when', 'forced', 'take', 'back', 'entrance', 'John', 'Hopkins', 'live', 'pay', 'janitor', 'perfecting', 'operating', 'techniques', 'can', 'literally', 'perform', 'eyes', 'closed', 'perform', 'surgical', 'lights', 'hospital', 'where', 'black', 'men', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'called', 'PA', 'system', 'are', 'black', 'see', 'here', 'man', 'do', 'work', 'spite', 'lack', 'recognition', 'spite', 'being', 'ignored', 'again', 'again', 'year', 'year', 'brushed', 'aside', 'credit', 'greatness', 'when', 'only', 'when', 'passion', 'followed', 'first', 'foremost', 'work', 'worthy', 'not', 'applause.It', 'only', 'when', 'great', 'work', 'done', 'considering', 'applause', 'ending', 'so', 'long', 'coming', 'deeply', 'satisfying', 'new', 'oxygen', 'human', 'hearts']",Something the Lord Made
