Because we fell in love with the little guy, returning him to the shelter was not an option, even though he wanted to bite. So we purchased Cesar Millan's DVD set about how to deal with aggressive dogs. Within two days of watching these DVD's, our little guy was behaving 200% better than he was at the beginning. We have now had him for two months and happily report he no longer ants to bite, gets along very well with our other dogs and is a loving little guy that just needed some TLC and proper training.",5,Expert Advice,1323907200,"12 15, 2011",2011,669,"['wife', 'adopted', 'third', 'dog', 'local', 'animal', 'shelter', 'soon', 'realized', 'had', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'socializing', 'other', 'animals', 'people', 'fell', 'love', 'little', 'guy', 'returning', 'shelter', 'was', 'not', 'option', 'even', 'wanted', 'bite', 'purchased', 'Cesar', 'Millan', 'DVD', 'set', 'about', 'how', 'deal', 'aggressive', 'dogs', 'two', 'days', 'watching', 'DVD', 'little', 'guy', 'was', 'behaving', '200', '%', 'better', 'was', 'beginning', 'have', 'now', 'had', 'two', 'months', 'happily', 'report', 'no', 'longer', 'ants', 'bite', 'along', 'very', 'well', 'other', 'dogs', 'loving', 'little', 'guy', 'just', 'needed', 'TLC', 'proper', 'training']",N/A

Cesar is the man when it comes to dog psychology. He has several great videos.

The examples are CLEAR. They are nothing short of miraculous. Cesar gives direct reasons for WHY each dog is out of control. If you love shopping Amazon, you probably have learned to read reviews carefully and to discern honest, educated comments from those of ""passer-by"" reviewers who attack a product citing things that 20 or 30 other reviewers have already addressed as invalid. The great thing about the Amazon community is that you get to ""try"" a product out before you buy it simply by reading the reviews. I have saved a lot of money and frustration because I read these reviews carfully. If it doesn't make sense it probably is not an earnest review. Some delight in being a horse's patoot. This DVD and the Cesar Milan dog psychology in general is safe and proven effective. One only need pay attention to this or other Milan DVDs to see that truth.",5,Pay Attention and LEARN --it's that easy!,1321056000,"11 12, 2011",2011,1052,"['might', 'not', 'learn', 'anything', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'have', 'learning', 'disability', 'short-attention', 'span', 'are', 'just', 'unwilling', 'learn', 'truth', 'why', 'pet', 'misbehaves', 'aggressively', 'examples', 'are', 'CLEAR', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'miraculous', 'Cesar', 'direct', 'reasons', 'WHY', 'dog', 'control', 'love', 'shopping', 'Amazon', 'probably', 'have', 'learned', 'read', 'reviews', 'carefully', 'discern', 'honest', 'educated', 'comments', 'passer-by', 'reviewers', 'who', 'attack', 'product', 'citing', 'things', '20', '30', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'addressed', 'invalid', 'great', 'thing', 'Amazon', 'community', 'get', 'try', 'product', 'out', 'buy', 'simply', 'reading', 'reviews', 'have', 'saved', 'lot', 'money', 'frustration', 'read', 'reviews', 'carfully', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'probably', 'not', 'earnest', 'review', 'delight', 'being', 'horse', 'patoot', 'DVD', 'Cesar', 'Milan', 'psychology', 'general', 'safe', 'proven', 'effective', 'One', 'only', 'need', 'pay', 'attention', 'other', 'Milan', 'DVDs', 'see', 'truth']",N/A

As I have had an aggressive dog it gave me a few good ideas on how to deal with it and what signs to look for to indicate pending aggressive episodes.

972210,A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH,B000EGDAMK,"The Three Woods ""mommy2lile""","[36, 37]","If you have tried every possible trainer out there in your area, and they all offer silly advice like ""clicker train"", ""praise the dog when it does this or that"" and other nicey-nice responses or the extreme opposite - ""smack the dogs head back when he looks at you for grabbing his tail"" to control an extremely aggressive dog,  then this is the DVD for you! Cesar Millan was recommended by an AKC trainer who said that sometimes you need a little more than what's out there in ""humane training"". She was right! What a difference it made in a Labradoodle who was a seriously abused rescue dog. Trying the ""nice"" way didn't do anything for him. He didn't need someone who was all sweet and happy with praise. He needed someone calm and assertive. If you watch the videos and really pay attention to the way Cesar handles himself, you'll note he really reacts the same way you see Alpha dogs react. I use his techniques now with every dog/puppy I work with. I am very thrilled to say I have had nothing but positive results. I have even been able to capture strays in our neighborhood using his techniques - which makes our neighborhood a safer place for our kids.HOWEVER, I recommend going to the National Geographic website to view small snipits of some shows, or watching the shows on the National Geographic channel to make sure you are comfortable with trying his techniques. I believe you might even find his DVDs in a local library. Otherwise, if you are familiar with his techniques, I would recommend buying from Amazon as they are definitely the cheapest that I have found.",5,AWESOME MATERIAL AND ADVICE,1173830400,"03 14, 2007",2007,1582,"['have', 'tried', 'possible', 'trainer', 'there', 'area', 'offer', 'silly', 'advice', 'clicker', 'train', 'praise', 'dog', 'when', 'other', 'nicey-nice', 'responses', 'extreme', 'opposite', 'smack', 'dogs', 'head', 'back', 'when', 'grabbing', 'tail', 'control', 'extremely', 'aggressive', 'dog', 'then', 'DVD', 'Cesar', 'Millan', 'was', 'recommended', 'AKC', 'trainer', 'who', 'said', 'sometimes', 'need', 'little', 'more', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'humane', 'training', 'was', 'right', 'What', 'difference', 'made', 'Labradoodle', 'who', 'was', 'seriously', 'abused', 'rescue', 'dog', 'Trying', 'nice', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'sweet', 'happy', 'praise', 'needed', 'someone', 'calm', 'assertive', 'watch', 'videos', 'really', 'pay', 'attention', 'way', 'Cesar', ""'ll"", 'note', 'really', 'same', 'way', 'see', 'Alpha', 'dogs', 'react', 'use', 'techniques', 'now', 'dog/puppy', 'work', 'am', 'very', 'thrilled', 'say', 'have', 'had', 'nothing', 'positive', 'results', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'able', 'capture', 'strays', 'neighborhood', 'using', 'techniques', 'neighborhood', 'safer', 'place', 'kids.HOWEVER', 'recommend', 'going', 'National', 'Geographic', 'website', 'view', 'small', 'snipits', 'shows', 'watching', 'shows', 'National', 'Geographic', 'channel', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'comfortable', 'trying', 'techniques', 'believe', 'might', 'even', 'find', 'DVDs', 'local', 'library', 'Otherwise', 'are', 'familiar', 'techniques', 'would', 'recommend', 'buying', 'Amazon', 'are', 'definitely', 'cheapest', 'have', 'found']",N/A
