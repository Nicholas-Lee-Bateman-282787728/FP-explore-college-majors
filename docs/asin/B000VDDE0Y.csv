It took a while but it was well worth it when I finaly got it! Frasier is one of the series that never lost its edge during it's entire (11 year) run. The stories were always fresh and while there were running story lines, individual episodes never repeated themes, the charachters were always consistantly funny and the dry intelectual humour was easily understood by everyone. If I had to pick favorites I would say the relationship between Niles and Frasier provided the most consistent laughs although all the other charachters were funny too. Niles's low key dry wit and physical humour and Frasiers straight man sarcastic dry comments cannot be surpassed anywhere else on TV.

While the physical timing of many episodes (""The Ring Cycle"" for example) is rather off it's better than most series could ever hope for.Once again there are no extras but at least we don't have to suffer through previews on Disc One as you can choose to go straight to the main menu.  Compared to the Seinfeld DVDs, I have to wonder why Frasier gets such a poor treatment. This is one of the great sitcoms of all time, can't we at least get some bloopers, commentary, or at least a list of Emmy wins? I suppose not unless we get a Blue Ray ""Ultimate"" edition.We have quite a few guest appearances this season; unfortunately none of them are particularly memorable.  Dean Cain, Brent Spiner, Bob Hoskins & particularly Nana Visitor who spent seven years starring in Star Trek: Deep Space 9 only to be regulated to a few minutes in ""Daphne Does Dinner"". I wonder just exactly why she took this job since she doesn't even get a close up, not to mention any memorable lines.Also, if you look at the small print on the DVD box, you'll see that some of the episodes may be from the syndicated run instead of the original full length versions. I would think that if CBS Video had the original masters for the previous 10 DVD releases, why do they not in this particular season? This is rather disturbing, especially since they do not indicate which episodes are from the syndicated run.Having said all that, I have enjoyed this DVD edition and would recommend it to all Frasier fans.Tidbits:- The final tally of spine photos is as follows: Eddie 4, Frasier 6, Eddie & Frasier 1-  Dr. Phil once played football for the University of Tulsa...and he was a linebacker when  Houston scored 100 points on them back in 1968.
