We are drawn into the movie and wonder how much of this played out in real life. Skeet Ulrich plays the hacker, Kevin Mitnick, that feels hacking is an innocent way to expose the governments shortcomings. The problem is he has downloaded government files and proprietary documents, therefore stolen, files from the top security analyst and others. Now of course these files expose that the analyst wasn't so innocent either, but that hardly justifies what Mitnick does. The hypocrisy with most of this is hackers would be hell bent for justice, revenge, or payback if someone stole their software. Overall good story, acting, camera work, and directing. Check out as rental, but you may want to add to your collection if you enjoy the hacker movies. Good quality DVD with decent replayability.

I was ignorant of the real facts behind the story of Kevin Mitnick. See &#34;Freedom Downtime&#34; (free on You Tube), a documentary with the real facts about Kevin Mitnick. This movie should be criticized for its innuendo, inaccuracies, and downright B.S.  A movie that is supposed to be based on a true story should try its best to be true to that story. This was made by people who presented a fallacious slant , a biased account of the facts. In short folks this was a bad movie from an ethical viewpoint. if you don't care about the truth or ethics or even an attempt at realizing these, than this is the movie for you. And you will probably stop reading at this point. For anyone continuing to read let me tell you that this so called &#34;criminal&#34; spent 8 months in solitary confinement , a real disgrace to the American justice system since the vast majority of criminal activity attributed to Kevin Mitnick was pure fantasy. Markoff, the New York times journalist who covered the Mitnick story, never met or talked with Mitnick.He based his articles on rumours and gouvernment claims.

839655,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0002L57YQ,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","""Trackdown"", called ""Takedown"" in Europe after the book on which it is based, is one of those unfortunate attempts by Hollywood to make current events into slick entertainment. It was released in 2000 in Europe, just months after Kevin Mitnick, its hacker anti-hero, was released after serving 5 years in prison. The script was primarily based on the book ""Takedown"" by computer security expert Tsutomu Shimomura and New York Times journalist John Markoff about the efforts to catch Mitnick. The book has been much criticized as exaggeration and hype. Interestingly, one of ""Trackdown""'s writers, John Danza, found the more sympathetic account of the same events in ""The Fugitive Game"" by Jonathan Littman more interesting, and tried to incorporate that perspective into the script. The results are thematically confusing but did result in a lawsuit by Littman against Miramax. Kevin Mitnick also sued for defamation, which was settled out of court.As the film begins, Kevin Mitnick (Skeet Ulrich) is on probation for unspecified computer crimes, and his friend Alex Lowe (Donal Logue) is trying to convince him to give up hacking. But Mitnick is a compulsive hacker. An FBI informant tries to impress him with information about a service that would allow Kevin to access FBI wiretaps, a ploy that backfires when Kevin acquires access and listens to the informant and his FBI handler. Then the film skips 2 years. Kevin is now targeting a computer security expert named Tsutomu Shimomura (Russell Wong), ostensibly provoked by Shimomura's testimony before Congress. Kevin threatens Shimomura over the phone, denies him access to his work computer system, and deletes and steals a large encrypted file. FBI agent Mitch Gibson (Christopher McDonald), who is under pressure to catch Mitnick due to hype generated by a series of New York Times articles, enlists Shimomura's help in tracking him.This is one of the most confusing movies I've seen, both narratively and thematically. It's not accurate, but that's not even the point once you start watching. It is 92 minutes of cat-and-mouse, as the FBI, and then Shimomura, pursue Mitnick relentlessly. It is never clear what Mitnick has done to deserve this. Although there is a mindboggling quantity of technical talk and action in the film, what characters are doing is never clear. I am not an IT person, however, so I can't say if Mitnick's or Shimomura's actions intelligible to that community. The FBI is politically motivated, which is clear enough. Shimomura supposedly just wants his file back. Mitnick is portrayed as ideological and compulsive, but with pathological tendencies. A fictional scene in which he physically beats Shimomura was removed from the script after protests by Mitnick's supporters. But we never understand Kevin's personality or what he has done to deserve this attention.The different approaches taken by different writers are evident in the final product. ""Trackdown"" is not sympathetic to anyone. Mitnick is remarkably talented at ""social engineering"" and evading the authorities. He's bright and more mischievous than harmful. But he's also an unstable menace to society. Shimomura is talented too, and he's played by the handsome Russell Wong. But he indulges in some shady activities in order to recover his file, and he is basically selfishly motivated. The FBI doesn't understand hacking and just wants to polish its image. Thematically, the film begins by comparing the ""information should be free"" ethos to communism and ends with Shimomura doing a ""mea culpa"" to express sympathy with that idea. Despite the frequent presence of Markoff's articles on screen, Agent Gibson says they're all hype. Markoff can't have been pleased. Agent Gibson also admits that he doesn't know what crime Mitnick committed.This film doesn't know what it's trying to say. The audience can't tell what is going on or why half the time. It seems that cinematographer Dermot Downs was brought in to spice up a lot of scenes of hacking and telephone calls. Downs has a background in music video. The quick-cutting, abstract visuals don't make things any clearer. Writer John Danza was unsatisfied with the script. John Markoff ""thought it was a fundamentally dishonest movie."" Mitnick sued. Littman sued. ""Trackdown"" was a commercial failure. But Kevin Mitnick's story is fascinating, both socially and legally. The story of how this film was and was not made is interesting. Mitnick's plight spawned the Free Kevin movement, one of the first examples of collaborative activism by hackers. Emmanuel Goldstein made a film about protesting this film, called ""Freedom Downtime"" (2001). Kevin Mitnick has written several books. For his account of the manhunt, check out Mitnick's keynote speech from HOPE 5.The DVD (Buena Vista 2004): There is one bonus feature, ""Behind the Kevin Mitnick Story"" (8 min), which interviews several producers, director Joe Chappelle, cinematographer Dermot Downs, and some of the cast about the directing style and how the characters are portrayed. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.",3,"Not Accurate.

The only people that manage to write reviews about it are ones to complain and are offended. These people are fans of a lame hacker by the name of Kevin Mitnik. Face it the character of Kevin in this movie was actually better than Kevin himself. The real Kevin Mitnik was quite lame and uninteresting, he just happened to get a lot of media attention. If an accurately based entertainment movie was made on him it would be extremely boring and nobody would watch it. If anything Kevin Mitnik should be proud of the great character and story they made of him in the movie.No movie made is 100% historically accurate, so why bother expecting it out of this one? This isn't a Kevin Mitnik documentary so don't expect it to be one. The movie is for entertainment and shows a more accurate world of hacking than other movies have so far. Sneakers, Swordfish, Hackers, are hardly if any at all based on the reality of hacking and computer security. Though Track Down isn't completely true either with mythical things such as contempt, it manages to be the most accurate hacker movie to date. Track Down interestingly demonstrates how technology and especially people can be exploited.The soundtrack of this movie is also spectacular. Though never relased and I wish it was, the movie has a great mix of rock and electronic music that fits the scenes very well and in my opinion manages to outdo the majority of movie soundtracks.If you enjoy computers I would recommend you watch this movie but don't take it that far as to how ""historically"" accurate it really is, because that takes the fun out of this great movie.
