However, I wish I knew how to get a copy of that song.  The relationship between Sheen and the little girl was precious.  The story is about a working MoM who needs a sitter tio take care of her daughter.  Sheen finds an attraction to the MOM and tries to get noticed by trying out for the position.  Good dynamics between child and adult playing out power struggles are displayed. I expected something more from the ending. It could have pushed the dilm to higher levels of awards and creative achievement had they put a forward to daughters wedding and make Sheen an older Father, so thatit could be implied his role modeling a Dad meant something like love or happiness for the daughter.

272015,AYZLXLVMJGTJV,6301907906,L. J Nary,"[2, 3]","This movie would be only a one star if not for Sheen's heartwarming performance. He even outshines the child star which is unusual in most films that I have seen. He has a way of acting that is engaging and makes the movie worth viewing. The plot is pretty much nonexistent and is something you can find on t.v. channels most anytime, the difference being they don't have a Martin Sheen starring in them. There is one particular scene where he is playing with a barbie doll with the child actor and the way he talks for the barbies, playacting, is just really funny. I think this one scene alone was what made the movie worthwhile to view. The movie is a romantic comedy where Sheen is portraying a maid but is in real life, a busy Wall Street man with a flare for sucess. He becomes a maid for Bisset's character at first because he is attracted to her, not really thinking he would actually have to become a maid. But Bisset is desparate and he works for her until he starts his new job at a bank where Bisset is the manager in Paris. She does not know that he is the new man coming from New York and he does not know she works at the firm he will be starting at as soon as he has settled in at his new surroundings. Anyways pretty one-dimensional storyline with not much to offer in the way of thoughts and provoking subject matter but funny and cute only because of Martin Sheens acting ability!Lisa Nary",3,Martin Sheen makes this come alive!,1016668800,"03 21, 2002",2002,1408,"['movie', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'not', 'Sheen', 'heartwarming', 'performance', 'even', 'child', 'star', 'unusual', 'most', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'way', 'acting', 'engaging', 'movie', 'viewing', 'plot', 'pretty', 'much', 'nonexistent', 'something', 'can', 'find', 't.v', 'channels', 'most', 'anytime', 'difference', 'being', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'starring', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'where', 'playing', 'barbie', 'doll', 'child', 'actor', 'way', 'barbies', 'playacting', 'just', 'really', 'funny', 'think', 'one', 'scene', 'alone', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'view', 'movie', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'where', 'Sheen', 'portraying', 'maid', 'real', 'life', 'busy', 'Wall', 'Street', 'man', 'flare', 'sucess', 'maid', 'Bisset', 'character', 'first', 'attracted', 'not', 'really', 'thinking', 'would', 'actually', 'have', 'become', 'maid', 'Bisset', 'desparate', 'new', 'job', 'bank', 'where', 'Bisset', 'manager', 'Paris', 'not', 'know', 'new', 'man', 'coming', 'New', 'York', 'not', 'know', 'firm', 'will', 'be', 'starting', 'as', 'soon', 'settled', 'new', 'surroundings', 'Anyways', 'pretty', 'one-dimensional', 'storyline', 'not', 'much', 'offer', 'way', 'thoughts', 'provoking', 'subject', 'matter', 'funny', 'cute', 'only', 'Martin', 'Sheens', 'acting', 'ability', 'Lisa', 'Nary']",N/A

The plot is very light - a banker arriving in Paris for a new job is attracted by a colleague (Jacequeline Bisset) but does not reveal to her that he is a financier too, and instead takes on a job as the maid for her apartment, and nanny for her young daughter in order to get close to her. Martin Sheen is a joy to behold in this film, and has excellent lines too. The eventual attraction between hero and heroine is built up carefully, and at the end is convincing. The film is also a great tutorial for men on how to behave with their young children ! A sweet film which I can strongly recommend.

When he shows up at her door, she mistakes him for the new maid and nanny to her obnoxious daughter (Victoria Shalet). Smitten, he continues the charade as he works for her as a maid but little does she know that he is actually her new colleague at the investment firm she works for. When one thinks of romantic comedy leading men, Martin Sheen is far from the top of the list and this film proves why. He's a fine dramatic actor but short on charm and though he gives it the old college try, his performance is awkward and he looks uncomfortable. Granted the wan material gives him no help at all but Bisset seems to have no problem fitting in. There aren't any surprises and the film dutifully goes through its paces till its predictable conclusion. Directed by Ian Toynton.
