What  this set has is just  1  DVD and so both  movies are on  1 disc and in  black  and white. The back  of the DVD  case shows the colorized photos which makes you think the films are the color versions.  The menus also show colorized photos.  The VHS versions which are in color  looked very good but for some reason  Universal  decided to  not include them.The real prize of this DVD is the extra, which is Shirley's very first  movie and which has NEVER before been available on  VHS or DVD or  16MM or any other format. ""THE RUNT PAGE"".Shirley is not shown much  at  all during the 10 minutes this film  runs. She is shown  right  after the opening credits and then again  during the  last  3 minutes.  She is very  adorable here and, for this first  film  short, she is wearing only  shorts, she would be covered up  more in her next  7 berlesk  film shorts.In  this film short, she is aware of the camera and theres a few times where she is looking  at it.  She is so very adorable in her scenes and its amazing  that  at  this time she was 3 years old!You  will really  enjoy  this film short as well as the 2 movies which are in  super quality!ENJOY!",5,SUPER COLLECTION  OF HER 2 PARAMOUNT FILMS!,1114128000,"04 22, 2005",2005,1330,"['set', 'wonderful', 'few', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'set', 'was', 'first', 'announced', 'was', 'be', '2', 'disc', 'set', '2', 'films', 'were', 'be', 'colorized', 'versions', 'What', 'set', 'just', '1', 'DVD', 'so', 'both', 'movies', 'are', '1', 'disc', 'black', 'white', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'colorized', 'photos', 'think', 'films', 'are', 'color', 'versions', 'menus', 'also', 'show', 'colorized', 'photos', 'VHS', 'versions', 'are', 'color', 'looked', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'Universal', 'decided', 'not', 'include', 'them.The', 'real', 'prize', 'DVD', 'extra', 'Shirley', 'very', 'first', 'movie', 'NEVER', 'before', 'been', 'available', 'VHS', 'DVD', '16MM', 'other', 'format', 'RUNT', 'PAGE', '.Shirley', 'not', 'shown', 'much', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'shown', 'right', 'opening', 'credits', 'then', 'again', 'last', '3', 'minutes', 'very', 'adorable', 'here', 'first', 'film', 'short', 'wearing', 'only', 'shorts', 'would', 'be', 'covered', 'up', 'more', 'next', '7', 'berlesk', 'film', 'shorts.In', 'film', 'short', 'aware', 'camera', 'few', 'times', 'where', 'looking', 'so', 'very', 'adorable', 'scenes', 'amazing', 'time', 'was', '3', 'years', 'old', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'film', 'short', 'as', 'well', '2', 'movies', 'are', 'super', 'quality', 'ENJOY']",Shirley Temple: Little Darling Pack (Little Miss Marker/Now and Forever/The Runt Page)
880226,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0007CNY7W,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 1]","LITTLE MISS MARKER:This is one of those movies you couldn't make today, that's for sure. A gambler leaves his adorable little girl (Shirley Temple) with a bookie as a ""marker"" until he can go home and get the $20 he wants to bet. But he committed suicide instead, probably because he heard the race he wanted to bet on over the radio and knew he had lost. Sorrowful Jones, the bookie, thus has custody of the kid, who tells him her mommy ""got awful tired and went away,"" by which we are to understand she died.So Sorrowful Jones takes her back to his apartment, and there is this cute little scene where she says she can't sleep in her underwear, and so Jones takes it off for her. Imagine making a scene like that today! She also jumps into his bed as he is preparing a bed for her out of two chairs, which is something the PC censors would never accept, either. And then there is the fact that when his friend Bubbles, the night-club singer, reads about the suicide of Markie's father in the newspaper, they do not instantly turn her over to the police. In fact, a policeman comes around looking for her, since they found Jones' betting ticket in the suicide's pocket, and Jones lies about having seen the kid.There's a lot of cuteness here, but like I say, very little that would be done these days. Also, frankly, if you subtract the cutest little kid anyone had seen in many a year, the actual story is very poorly written, the actors pretty hammy, and lots of stereotypes are perpetuated that would not be acceptable today. It did enjoy the scene where all these tough mugs dress up like King Arthur's knights of the round table, though.It's hard to assign stars to something like this, but I'll give it one for Shirley Temple herself, and one for the rest of the cast combined.NOW AND FOREVER:This is one I had not seen on TV when I was a kid, the way I did with ""Little Miss Marker."" I think I know why. Too much sympathy for criminals. Well, the gamblers in ""Marker"" were criminals, too, but it wasn't quite so obvious.Strange that Shirley Temple did so many movies with disreputable characters, isn't it?Gary Cooper plays her father, Carole Lombard is her step-mother. When the story opens, they are in China, swindling the hotel they've been staying in for three weeks out of the $805 they owe. (Yes, three weeks in a luxury hotel for $805. This was 1934, after all.) Cooper gets a letter from his brother-in-law, who has custody of his daughter ever since her mother (the old crab's sister) died. And of course he is an old crab. Cooper is determined to sell Shirley to him for $75,000, but when he gets to know her, she charms him so much he refuses to sell her, and instead takes her away with him. They go back to Paris, where Lombard is waiting for him. She didn't know he'd be bringing the kid along, but she had disapproved of selling her to the uncle.It happens that one of Cooper's swindles was on a man who was himself a swindler, and a jewel thief, and gets Cooper involved in his schemes because of having to pay some $2,000 for Shirley's posh school. These people have gotten used to living far above their means, you know.Cooper ends up in bed with a bullet wound, Shirley has been handed over to a rich lady who was as charmed by her as everyone always was, and there are gendarmes in Cooper's sick room ready to take him away. This story is perhaps a little better than ""Little Miss Marker,"" and it does have Gary Cooper, looking as charming as he was able to look when he was young, but Lombard looks like she's been wearing out. I don't think it was the makeup.Two stars, one for Cooper and one for Shirley.",3,Two Full Length Films and One Short,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,3636,"['LITTLE', 'MISS', 'MARKER', 'one', 'movies', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'today', 'sure', 'gambler', 'adorable', 'little', 'girl', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'bookie', 'marker', 'can', 'go', 'home', 'get', '20', 'bet', 'committed', 'suicide', 'instead', 'probably', 'heard', 'race', 'wanted', 'bet', 'radio', 'knew', 'had', 'lost', 'Sorrowful', 'Jones', 'bookie', 'thus', 'custody', 'kid', 'who', 'mommy', 'got', 'awful', 'tired', 'went', 'away', 'are', 'understand', 'died.So', 'Sorrowful', 'Jones', 'back', 'apartment', 'cute', 'little', 'scene', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'underwear', 'so', 'Jones', 'off', 'Imagine', 'making', 'scene', 'today', 'also', 'bed', 'preparing', 'bed', 'out', 'two', 'chairs', 'something', 'PC', 'censors', 'would', 'never', 'accept', 'then', 'fact', 'when', 'friend', 'Bubbles', 'night-club', 'singer', 'suicide', 'Markie', 'father', 'newspaper', 'do', 'not', 'instantly', 'turn', 'police', 'fact', 'policeman', 'around', 'looking', 'found', 'Jones', 'betting', 'ticket', 'suicide', 'pocket', 'Jones', 'having', 'seen', 'kid.There', 'lot', 'cuteness', 'here', 'say', 'very', 'little', 'would', 'be', 'done', 'days', 'Also', 'frankly', 'subtract', 'cutest', 'little', 'kid', 'anyone', 'had', 'seen', 'many', 'year', 'actual', 'story', 'very', 'poorly', 'written', 'actors', 'pretty', 'hammy', 'lots', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'perpetuated', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'acceptable', 'today', 'did', 'enjoy', 'scene', 'where', 'tough', 'mugs', 'dress', 'up', 'King', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'round', 'table', 'hard', 'assign', 'stars', 'something', ""'ll"", 'give', 'one', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'one', 'rest', 'cast', 'combined.NOW', 'FOREVER', 'one', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'TV', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'way', 'did', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Marker', 'think', 'know', 'why', 'Too', 'much', 'sympathy', 'criminals', 'Well', 'gamblers', 'Marker', 'were', 'criminals', 'too', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'obvious.Strange', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'did', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'disreputable', 'characters', ""n't"", 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'father', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'step-mother', 'When', 'story', 'are', 'China', 'swindling', 'hotel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'staying', 'three', 'weeks', '805', 'owe', 'Yes', 'three', 'weeks', 'luxury', 'hotel', '805', 'was', '1934', 'Cooper', 'letter', 'brother-in-law', 'who', 'custody', 'daughter', 'ever', 'mother', 'old', 'crab', 'sister', 'died', 'course', 'old', 'crab', 'Cooper', 'determined', 'sell', 'Shirley', '75,000', 'when', 'know', 'so', 'much', 'sell', 'instead', 'away', 'go', 'back', 'Paris', 'where', 'Lombard', 'waiting', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'be', 'bringing', 'kid', 'had', 'disapproved', 'selling', 'uncle.It', 'one', 'Cooper', 'swindles', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'swindler', 'jewel', 'thief', 'Cooper', 'involved', 'schemes', 'having', 'pay', '2,000', 'Shirley', 'posh', 'school', 'people', 'have', 'gotten', 'used', 'living', 'far', 'means', 'know.Cooper', 'up', 'bed', 'bullet', 'wound', 'Shirley', 'been', 'handed', 'over', 'rich', 'lady', 'who', 'was', 'charmed', 'everyone', 'always', 'was', 'are', 'gendarmes', 'Cooper', 'sick', 'room', 'ready', 'take', 'away', 'story', 'perhaps', 'little', 'better', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Marker', 'have', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'looking', 'as', 'charming', 'was', 'able', 'look', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'Lombard', 'been', 'wearing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'makeup.Two', 'stars', 'one', 'Cooper', 'one', 'Shirley']",Shirley Temple: Little Darling Pack (Little Miss Marker/Now and Forever/The Runt Page)

On the other hand, it is disturbing to notice the significant racial stereotyping and discrimination that is pervasive in the movies.

880232,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0007CNY7W,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[26, 30]","This DVD collects two of Shirley Temple's earliest movies and her very first short in one pack.  The movies are ""Little Miss Marker"" and ""Now and Forever.""  The short is ""The Runt Page.""  Fans of Shirley Temple will want these early films for their collection.""The Runt Page""Shirley Temple has a minor role in this ten minute short.  She is rarely seen and has no speaking part.  Actually, none of the child actors has a speaking part as adults voiced all parts.  This short is a satire of ""The Front Page,"" which was released the year before, and features a host of small children dressed in diapers acting a short vignette based on that movie.  The short is fair, and by itself would probably rate only three stars.  The material is dated, the sound is poor, and I found the short somewhat tedious to watch.""Little Miss Marker""I have seen many, and perhaps most, of Shirley Temple's later movies.  Those movies feature Shirley in various states of peril.  However, I was unprepared for Shirley being a marker for a bet.  Though I was initially appalled that any father could use a child as a marker, the movie was actually quite well done and the only character who failed to come away improved from their contact with Shirley was Shirley's father.Marthy ""Marky"" Jane (Temple) is left by her father (Edward Earle, in an uncredited role) as a marker for a bet.  We do not see Marky's father again, but we learn that he lost his bet and committed suicide.  We wonder what will become of Shirley, but, never fear, Shirley charms even the meanest of hoodlums.  The ending provides redemption for the worst of the crowd, and foreshadows even more poignant (or maudlin, depending on your point of view) future Shirley Temple roles.In addition to Temple, the standout actor in this film is Adolphe Menjou as Sorrowful Jones.  Dorothy Dell was also quite good as a singer and marginal woman of ill repute Bangles Carson.  Unfortunately, Dell's career would be cut short soon after this film when she was killed in a car accident.The picture quality of this film is quite good and the sound is fair.  I thought both were acceptable considering the age of the movie and the likely quality of the original prints.  Improvements in both may be possible with newer technology, but complaints of either the picture or sound in this version are, in my opinion, unwarranted.If you can get past the initial concept of a father betting his daughter on a horse race, fans of Shirley Temple will enjoy this cute film.""Now and Forever""This movie is even stranger than the previous movie.  Gary Cooper plays a swindler(!), which seems strange given that he was already a star and had appeared in more than 50 movies.  I found it hard to accept Gary Cooper as a crook, even if he found redemption, as most co-stars did, with Shirley Temple.Jerry Day (Cooper) is offered the opportunity to allow his brother-in-law to raise the daughter he has not seen in years, Penelope ""Penny"" Day (Temple).  Penny's mother died soon after Penny was born and Jerry headed out to make his living my stealing.  Initially Jerry sees this offer as an opportunity to get a lot of money for a child he cares nothing about.  However, after meeting Penny, Jerry is charmed and decides he wants to raise her after all.Love interest Toni Carstairs (Carole Lombard) wants to settle down in one place and wants to stop Jerry's swindling, but does not think Jerry can do it.  Jerry tries hard to quit, but discovers that working at a real job does not pay enough for Penny's private school.  Jerry works one last job with jewel thief Felix Evans (Guy Standing), but soon regrets what he did, courtesy of his personal conscience Penny.The end of this movie is similar to many others with Shirley Temple.  Everyone is redeemed except for one person, and though the messy details are left off camera, the ending is happy.As with ""Little Miss Marker,"" the quality of this film is good.  The sound is probably better in this film than the previous film.  I found both to be quite acceptable for a film of this era.  My biggest struggle was with Gary Cooper in the role of a crook.  Cooper really did not pull of this role very well.  Further, Carole Lombard was too nagging as Toni Carstairs.  The only person walking away from this film with their reputation intact was Shirley Temple, who was incredibly cute and the scene stealer throughout.  Actually, there was one other standout performance, and that was Charlotte Granville as Mrs. J.H.P. Crane.  I will leave a viewer to discover why I thought her performance was very good or even excellent.Shirley Temple was well on her way to becoming a phenomenon when she made this movie.  She rolls over Cooper and Lombard, both of whom were billed ahead of her, and becomes the real star of this movie.  Fans of Temple will absolutely need this movie for their collection.

Contrary to the review previous to this one, the prints look and sound quite good, even--incredibly--The Runt Page, which is the oldest feature on the disk. The captions are, for once, quite accurate, and I believe there are some other language options as well.On the downside, the only insert is an ad for other titles in the series--no hard-copy chapter list. It also seems to me that perhaps commentary by Mrs. Black (Temple's married moniker) might have added value to the package.If you're not familiar with Shirley Temple, be warned: you're about to witness a full-fledged phenomenon. Shirley Temple is one of the most remarkable women ever born, and is certainly the greatest child star of all time.

Mixed in between, she did two films from Paramount, both presented here, released by Universal (now Comcast). Both films are missing from Fox sets and are in pristine restored (and captioned) shape on this disc. They are the B&W; originals, not the later colorized versions, which is why this disc gets only four stars from me.The real gem is the rarely-included The Runt Pack, the first picture Shirley ever appeared in. Again, the picture and sound quality are very clean and in the original B&W.; What is more disappointing about the ten-minute picture is that all the children's spoken parts are voice-overs by adults.
