1442058,A1UDL8R0OQDZ5P,B0054TOU4O,Anthony J. Simeone,"[1, 2]","I thought this movie had a lot of potential at the beginning.  It started out as a good, clean, Christian, family oriented film.  Baseball in the 1920's.  Something that the whole family could watch and enjoy.  Not that this is a film that the family can't enjoy, but this movie took a sidestep, and went off on a deep tangent about alcoholism, and how drinking alcohol, even 1 sip, was so very wrong, and such a bad sin.  I can understand how it might be wrong to drink in over abundance, but this movie went on and on, harping on how bad alcohol was, and that a 'good Christian' should stay far far away from it.  Instead of enjoying a good clean baseball movie, I was being lectured repeatidly about the theme of how drinking is wrong and bad for you.  Very misleading.  They should have changed the title to Milltown Drunk, and people describing the movie and what it is about should give the potential viewer a warning about how the movie harps on alcholism.  I was very distracted with this underlying theme, circulating throughout the entire movie, and felt it took away from baseball in the 20's, a lot.",2,Really disappointed,1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,1111,"['thought', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'beginning', 'started', 'out', 'good', 'clean', 'Christian', 'family', 'oriented', 'film', 'Baseball', '1920', 'Something', 'whole', 'family', 'could', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'Not', 'film', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'took', 'sidestep', 'went', 'off', 'deep', 'tangent', 'alcoholism', 'how', 'drinking', 'alcohol', 'even', '1', 'sip', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'wrong', 'bad', 'sin', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'might', 'be', 'wrong', 'drink', 'abundance', 'movie', 'went', 'harping', 'how', 'bad', 'alcohol', 'was', ""'good"", 'Christian', 'should', 'stay', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'Instead', 'enjoying', 'good', 'clean', 'baseball', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'lectured', 'repeatidly', 'theme', 'how', 'drinking', 'wrong', 'bad', 'Very', 'misleading', 'should', 'have', 'changed', 'title', 'Milltown', 'Drunk', 'people', 'describing', 'movie', 'what', 'about', 'should', 'give', 'potential', 'viewer', 'warning', 'how', 'movie', 'harps', 'alcholism', 'was', 'very', 'distracted', 'underlying', 'theme', 'circulating', 'entire', 'movie', 'felt', 'took', 'away', 'baseball', '20', 'lot']",Milltown Pride

1442062,A2FF6HVK48D1C0,B0054TOU4O,Tim Williams,"[1, 2]","""Milltown Pride"" is a shaky, sightly, sincere, stagy film about baseball and faith in the 1920's. An old rhyme goes, ""Shed a tear for Jimmy Brown, for Jimmy is no more; for what he thought was H2O was H2SO4."" Alas, sincerity is not enough. I wish I could give this film higher praise, because I care deeply about the message and the messengers, and I love baseball, but I can't. Concerning production values, the scenery and costumes look good. Concerning the baseball scenes, it's spotty. Sometimes the baseball looks phony and sometimes it looks okay, but the scales are tipped to the phoniness side by having the hero bat out of order in the climactic scene. I wish the script had not had him pinch run in the bottom of the eighth. Concerning the drama, there just aren't enough believable scenes, the dialogue sounds artificial, and there is too much telling instead of showing. We are told how terrible drunkenness is, but we don't really see it. We are told how poor and different the mill folk are, but we aren't really shown it. Concerning theology, some questions arise. A great deal of emphasis is put on the theme of teetotalism, but the stated goal of the film is evangelistic. It would seem that the teetotalism emphasis would be more appropriate in a teaching film about alcoholism. In this film, it seems to distract from the main theme and possibly confuse. For example, why is there so much more emphasis on teetotalism than on Mr. and Mrs. Wright's snobbery? Some might be misled into thinking that salvation from sin is a matter of not doing certain external things. Also, addressing teetotalism in a film like this makes it very likely that the subject will not be dealt with in depth. This can easily lead to being uncharitably superficial toward those who disagree. My favorite aspects are the Billy Sunday sermon, the bonus features and the use of ""Coming Home"" in the soundtrack. Wait till next year.",2,Poor Jimmy Brown,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,1924,"['Milltown', 'Pride', 'shaky', 'sightly', 'sincere', 'stagy', 'film', 'baseball', 'faith', '1920', 'old', 'rhyme', 'Shed', 'tear', 'Jimmy', 'Brown', 'Jimmy', 'more', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'H2O', 'was', 'H2SO4', 'Alas', 'sincerity', 'not', 'enough', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'film', 'higher', 'praise', 'care', 'deeply', 'message', 'messengers', 'love', 'baseball', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Concerning', 'production', 'values', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'look', 'good', 'Concerning', 'baseball', 'scenes', 'spotty', 'Sometimes', 'baseball', 'phony', 'okay', 'scales', 'are', 'tipped', 'phoniness', 'side', 'having', 'hero', 'bat', 'order', 'climactic', 'scene', 'wish', 'script', 'had', 'not', 'had', 'pinch', 'run', 'bottom', 'eighth', 'Concerning', 'drama', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'believable', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'artificial', 'too', 'much', 'telling', 'instead', 'showing', 'are', 'told', 'how', 'terrible', 'drunkenness', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'are', 'told', 'how', 'poor', 'different', 'mill', 'folk', 'are', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'shown', 'Concerning', 'theology', 'questions', 'arise', 'great', 'deal', 'emphasis', 'put', 'theme', 'teetotalism', 'stated', 'goal', 'film', 'evangelistic', 'would', 'seem', 'teetotalism', 'emphasis', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'teaching', 'film', 'alcoholism', 'film', 'distract', 'main', 'theme', 'possibly', 'confuse', 'example', 'why', 'there', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'emphasis', 'teetotalism', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Wright', 'snobbery', 'might', 'be', 'misled', 'thinking', 'salvation', 'sin', 'matter', 'not', 'doing', 'certain', 'external', 'things', 'Also', 'addressing', 'teetotalism', 'film', 'very', 'likely', 'subject', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dealt', 'depth', 'can', 'easily', 'lead', 'being', 'uncharitably', 'superficial', 'who', 'disagree', 'favorite', 'aspects', 'are', 'Billy', 'Sunday', 'sermon', 'bonus', 'features', 'use', 'Coming', 'Home', 'soundtrack', 'Wait', 'till', 'next', 'year']",Milltown Pride
