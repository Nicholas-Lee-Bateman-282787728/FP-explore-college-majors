It is one of those rare special moves that is able to touch on many emotions.  Watching this made me understand the true meaning of imagination and not letting go of your innocent wonder.The movie is loosely based on the life of the man who wrote the play Peter Pan.  The story helps you understand the purity in this mans heart to open peoples mind to imagination.  From beginning to end I was in another world and it seemed nothing bad could happen.  It is really a visual journey that is pleasantly set in England at the turn of the 20th century.  Kate Winslett and Johnny Depp do a superb job in there roles as they show why they are two of the best actors of this current generation.  Except this story has wonderful acting all over.  From the children to the adults who acted as children.  It really is a special tale for all those to see.  I really can't think of anything bad to say about this movie.  For it woke up my creative spirit and opened my eyes to the fantastic Neverland that is in all our hearts.I was lucky enough to view this on Blu-ray and I must say it looks fabulous.

879878,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0007CNXUK,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","This biopic tailor made for the family is a nice way to spend an evening at home.  It's sweet, dramatic, traumatic and overall delightfully charming.  It has almost every element you'd want in family entertainment.  It has a wonderful script and a stellar cast and the set designs were wonderfully crafted, able to cast a sense of mystery and fantasy while still carrying a touch of reality.  I myself have always been a fan on the biopic, and when that said biopic is done brilliantly, well then I can be found close to tears.  Let's just say that `Finding Neverland' is on the verge of heavenly in my boat.Following J.M. Barrie as he struggles to pick himself up from his last stage disaster, Depp does a wonderful job investing charm and humor in his character while still layering him with an apparent sadness.  He's fallen out of touch with his wife, played by the tragically underused Radha Mitchell.  His last few plays have been flops, and while he parades himself as the optimist on the outside Depp subtly allows us to see this man crumbling inside.  When Depp was first nominated for the Oscar I didn't quite get it, but after several viewings of this film I now understand.  His performance was understated and subtle, and in those subtleties he was able to breathe reality into J.M. Barrie.Just when writers block seems to have taken its hold of Barrie he runs into a young widow Sylvia, played by the iconic Kate Winslet, and her four young boys.  Barrie soon takes an attachment to the boys, and they to him, and it's in their fire that he finds inspiration for the play that made him a household name, Peter Pan.  Winslet's performance is probably the most difficult of the cast, and she pulls it off with flying colors.  She's able to evoke every emotion out of the audience without ever appearing overly needy or displaying a shred of self-pity.  Her character has only her children in mind even as she falls apart on the inside.  Like in Depps case, it's the subtlety in the performance that makes the character all the more real.Another highlight to the film is newcomer Freddie Highmore who plays Sylvia's more emotionally troubled son Peter.  His mature performance perfectly compliments those of the adult cast, and his tears in a few key scenes will mirror yours as you become emotionally invested in this young boy.The film beautifully captures the spirit of adolescence and shows the importance for children to have a father and for men to have children.  Even though Barrie was not a father himself, much less the father of the four boys that inspired him, the five of them needed each other and grew together because of it.  It's a wonderful family film complete with a stellar supporting cast as well including Dustin Hoffman and Julie Christie.  There are few films that both parents and children can enjoy, so when gems like this film arrive we do well to swoop in and devour them.",5,"Charming and delightful, wonderful entertainment for the whole family...",1182384000,"06 21, 2007",2007,2912,"['biopic', 'tailor', 'made', 'family', 'nice', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'home', 'sweet', 'dramatic', 'traumatic', 'overall', 'delightfully', 'charming', 'almost', 'element', ""'d"", 'want', 'family', 'entertainment', 'wonderful', 'script', 'stellar', 'cast', 'set', 'designs', 'were', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', 'able', 'cast', 'sense', 'mystery', 'fantasy', 'still', 'carrying', 'touch', 'reality', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'biopic', 'when', 'said', 'biopic', 'done', 'brilliantly', 'well', 'then', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'close', 'tears', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'verge', 'heavenly', 'boat.Following', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'pick', 'up', 'last', 'stage', 'disaster', 'Depp', 'wonderful', 'job', 'investing', 'charm', 'humor', 'character', 'still', 'layering', 'apparent', 'sadness', 'fallen', 'touch', 'wife', 'played', 'tragically', 'underused', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'last', 'few', 'plays', 'have', 'been', 'flops', 'optimist', 'outside', 'Depp', 'subtly', 'see', 'man', 'crumbling', 'inside', 'When', 'Depp', 'was', 'first', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'several', 'viewings', 'film', 'now', 'understand', 'performance', 'was', 'understated', 'subtle', 'subtleties', 'was', 'able', 'breathe', 'reality', 'J.M', 'Barrie.Just', 'when', 'writers', 'block', 'have', 'taken', 'hold', 'Barrie', 'young', 'widow', 'Sylvia', 'played', 'iconic', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'four', 'young', 'boys', 'Barrie', 'soon', 'attachment', 'boys', 'fire', 'inspiration', 'play', 'made', 'household', 'name', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Winslet', 'performance', 'probably', 'most', 'difficult', 'cast', 'off', 'flying', 'colors', 'able', 'evoke', 'emotion', 'audience', 'ever', 'appearing', 'overly', 'needy', 'displaying', 'shred', 'self-pity', 'character', 'only', 'children', 'mind', 'even', 'apart', 'inside', 'Depps', 'case', 'subtlety', 'performance', 'character', 'more', 'real.Another', 'highlight', 'film', 'newcomer', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'who', 'Sylvia', 'more', 'emotionally', 'troubled', 'son', 'Peter', 'mature', 'performance', 'perfectly', 'adult', 'cast', 'tears', 'few', 'key', 'scenes', 'will', 'mirror', 'yours', 'become', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'young', 'boy.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'spirit', 'adolescence', 'importance', 'children', 'have', 'father', 'men', 'have', 'children', 'Even', 'Barrie', 'was', 'not', 'father', 'much', 'less', 'father', 'four', 'boys', 'inspired', 'five', 'needed', 'other', 'grew', 'together', 'wonderful', 'family', 'film', 'complete', 'stellar', 'supporting', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'parents', 'children', 'can', 'enjoy', 'so', 'when', 'gems', 'film', 'arrive', 'do', 'well', 'swoop', 'devour']",Finding Neverland
879879,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0007CNXUK,Andy Orrock,"[2, 7]","'Finding Neverland' is a good enough movie...as fiction.  However, when seen through the prism of the 'biopic' (as it was presented to the public), it comes up short.  I put 'Neverland' into the same category of 'Hurricane': films in which the writers and directors feel oddly compelled to shape facts and invent new truths to weave some false sense of heightened emotional narrative into the tale.Which is a shame, because neither film needs these lies.  In 'Hurricane,' Rubin Carter's life and his triumph over gross injustice is incredible enough and didn't require the writers inventing a single, bent detective holding a decades-long vendetta against him.  This license to invent undermined what should have been an Oscar-winning portrayal by Denzel Washington (his win for 'Training Day' was a make-up call).In 'Finding Neverland,' much of the movie is based upon Johnny Depp's J.M. Barrie befriending of Kate Winslet's Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, recently widowed with four young boys in tow.  Nice movie, but the truth of Barrie's life is that, ahem, Ms. Llewlyn Davies was in fact very much un-widowed when Mr. Barrie began showering attention on her family.  In other words, the key emotional driver of the film was invented as a plot device.The recent gold standard for biopics is Bill Condon's ""Kinsey.""  Watch that, and then watch Frontline's recent documentary on the same subject, and you'll see that Condon was able to make a powerful, compelling film that took no liberties with the actual events of Kinsey's life.Criticism aside, 'Neverland' continues the streak of strong performances by Mr. Depp, and Kate Winslet is as winning and winsome as ever.  And, 20 years from now, people may remember 'Neverland' as Freddie Highmore's debut.

It was directed with a sense of what I could imagine how Barrie viewed things in his life. Visually the movie is very beautiful with top-notch production.  Moreover, I'm glad the director avoided being too sentimental with the material. Instead, the movie develops with emotional scenes that carry real value in the characters and the audience.

The story is also about being creative using your mind to help you become a writer and write plays.  Depp found some children in a nearby park (actually, they found him) and throughout the film, Depp wanted the children to use their imagination to help them appreciate another side of life- dreaming and telling stories.That's what I got out of the story.

879889,A14QAT1XDSCLEO,B0007CNXUK,Bitcetc,"[6, 7]","By the time Johnny Depp receives his due, it will be long overdue. There are many elements of beauty in this film; Depp's performance as J.M. Barrie, the author of ""Peter Pan"", is one of the most moving.In thinking back over some of my favorite of his performances: ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Chocolat"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", among others, I was trying to distill the reason why there is not a ""Johnny Depp""-identifiable role-- a typecast part which we all recognize Depp must play. And yet, when Johnny Depp plays a role, it becomes impossible to imagine it being played by anyone else. Depp seems to be a genuine romantic in his real life, and that may be part of the something special he brings to the souls of the characters he plays. They are ""romantic"" in the classical sense. Somehow he leaves this jaded, too-hip, too-wise-and-world-weary world behind in bringing to life characters who are rarely motivated by cynicism, but who are open and susceptible to the splendid draughts and drags of emotionally large and tumultuous or tiny and subtle events. His eyes are magic. He is a spellbinder.The cynical may well be uncomfortable with this movie. It is, after all, about the power of ""believing""--- and pretending---, about a playwright who did not want to grow up, but who recognized to the fraction of an instant when the dividing line between childhood and adulthood had been crossed. On the other hand, if you have the genius, as did J.M. Barrie in this story, to scatter a child's view throughout the theater of your perception, then the pure romance of the biographical story (""inspired by true events"", but not necessarily true events) behind the story of the creation of ""Peter Pan"" is wonderfully transporting.Evocative music, unabashedly old-fashioned and romantic, was my first clue that I had come to the theater ill-equipped. I was going to need Kleenex, and I had none. The characters are played by exceptionally beautiful people: Kate Winslet is lovely and likeable as Mrs. Llewelyn-Davies, widowed mother of the boys who became the inspiration for Barrie's most famous play; the luminous Julie Christie as Mrs. du Maurier, Mrs. Llewelyn's mother, is almost our hero's antagonist in opposing Barrie's involvement with her daughter and grandchildren, and yet her motives are understandable; the Llewelyn-Davies children, especially Peter, played by Freddie Highmore, are people we would like to meet and have as friends almost from the instant they appear on screen. Even Barrie's poor wife (Radha Mitchell), supportive when his previous play flops, then neglected in favor of his muse and inspiration for his greatly successful play ""Peter Pan"", is a sympathetic figure in spite of her conflict with her charming husband.  When Dustin Hoffman becomes a mere foil and a footnote as the play's producer, one clearly has an abundance of riches.The cinematographer and set designer do a lovely job of marrying the fantasy and the reality: the film looks beautiful. Highlighted details like the early electric lightbulbs and the period automobiles underscore the changing of an age and the ""toys-for-adults"" aspect of nascent industrial technology. The costuming is also a visual treat.Without being too overtly didactic, the movie both illustrates inspiration and inspires. If you aspire to be a writer, or just to reclaim a little innocence, this would be one to own on DVD when it comes out. But don't deny yourself the marvelous pleasure of seeing it now, and rooting for it to be remembered at Oscar time.

879890,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0007CNXUK,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[5, 7]","Mr. Barrie's (Johnny Depp) play, Peter Pan, was so ground-breaking, so unusual, that even his producer (Dustin Hoffman) thought him a bit cuckoo when he presented his ideas to him. And with the miserable failure of his last play, it's little surprise.But this new one has something unusual, something not quite tangible in the mind. Why? Because Mr. Barrie's inspiration was a group of young boys who've lost their father and are preparing for the worst kind of news about their mother, too (played excellently by Kate Winslet).What struck me as interesting and incredible about the film is that it focuses on the muse of a writer; and this muse is pretty dark. Peter (Freddie Highmore), is a lonely boy even within his family of brothers. He misses his father terribly, and he doesn't know how to grieve. So when Johnny Depp appears in his life, he's none too happy about it (""You can't replace my father""). Can this young boy find salvation in the writings of one man? Can he find that bit of serendipity that we all lose as children when we hit the barrier of adulthood? Even with his mother in mortal danger?Sound kinda dark? It is. But the amazing thing about it is that the film is tremendously uplifting, even with death looming in the shadows.I will say that Johnny Depp never ceases to amaze me. I loved him in Pirates of the Caribbean, and it was often times difficult for me to imagine that this was the same actor playing this role. Kate Winslet was excellent as the ailing mother. Julie Christie was wonderful as the protective grandmother of Winslet's children. But to me, the show stealer was undoubtedly Freddie Highmore (Peter). I don't know where this boy came from, but his presence on screen brought a lump to my throat from the moment I saw him, and by the end of the film everyone in the theater (I mean everyone!) was blubbering like a baby.

879891,A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ,B0007CNXUK,Boggman!,"[5, 18]","I watched this film last night and can not figure out, for the life of me, what all the ""hype"" is about.  Yes, we all love Johnny Depp, and many will say the same about Kate Winslet as well. However, not even these two talented performers can save this ""clunker"" from being the dreadful bore that it is.J.M. Barrie (Depp) is a London playwright in 1903. While writing in the park as he often does, he happens to stumble across Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Winslet) and her four children. Immediately taking a liking to them, he begans a relationship with the troop, which in return, gives him the inspiration to write ""Peter Pan"".First of all, does anyone really care? The character of J.M. Barrie for a full length feature film, just doesn't hold up. What is the surprise that a writer, while running around with 4 boys all day playing Cowboys and Indians, wouldn't start to get some kind of creative juice flowing? Doesn't take a genius to figure that out!! I found it very odd that J.M. Barrie was a married man, yet he spent all his free time running around with a widows children that aren't even his own? Barrie never even develops a romance with Davies, he simply plays with her kids all day long. Yet he refuses to introduce his wife to the family, nor involve her in any of his imaginative ""play dates"". It's almost as if he is having a love affair with these children, but not with their mother.  If someone were to do that by today's standards, people would be in an uproar.I side with Davies mother Mrs. Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie), who thinks the whole ordeal is outlandish, and that Barrie should back off, letting Davies (a widow) and the children, move on with their life. After all, he is a married & successful playwright, with a life of his own.  Of course, the children have become completely attached to Barrie, not realizing that when his writing is all said and done, the relationship with Barrie is more than likely to dissipate.Well, that's not what happens, due to the fact that Davies has a secret illness (the cause never revealed) that will eventually take her own life. She starts out with a little cough here and there, then suddenly becomes too weak to leave the house and then....well you can guess the rest.  It all happens rather quickly, without even a good explanation to the cause of her illness in the first place.Summed up in a nutshell: Man meets kids, man plays with kids, man enjoys spending time with surrogate family more than own wife, man writes play, wife leaves husband, play becomes timeless classic, childrens' mother dies, man gets joint custody of kids.ZZZZZZZZZZZ!!I found the entire movie to be pretty boring. A romance with Winslet is never developed, although at times it is hinted that Depp has really fallen for her. However, they never even kiss in the film, so it is all speculation really. The children in the film are like any children by todays standards; creative, spunky and full of energy. One is named Peter, and of course, Peter and Barrie have the strongest bond with each other.I feel that dispite the two talented leads, this movie has nothing to offer really.

It was produced well and the acting was good, but the storyline overly glorified Barrie, making him seem like a saint, and it failed to interest me.  It also altered Barrie's life too much for me to appreciate the film.In truth Barrie fell in love with Sylvia Llewelyn Davies while her husband Arthur was still alive and practically moved in with the family--one of those types of guests that you can't get rid of. The husband didn't approve of Barrie spending so much time with his wife and children. Can you blame him?  I would look upon someone who had such an interest in my children with suspicion.  In fact, it has often been suggested that Barrie was a pedophile and molested the children though no proof has ever been found to support that suspicion. Some claim he was asexual.At any rate Mr. Davies unsuccessfully kept Barrie away from his family even after he'd moved his family many miles away to put some distance between them and the writer. Arthur soon died and then Sylvia, and Barrie did in fact get custody of the children.I believe that the true events of Barrie's life are far more interesting than what was revealed in this film.

879899,A1W4HQPL1GXHLO,B0007CNXUK,"Casey Crookston ""Casey Crookston""","[4, 6]","""Finding Neverland"" instantly rose to my top 10 all time favorite movies.I don't recall the last time I was so captivated by a movie as I was when watching this one.  There have been many films which attempts to capture the world of children as seen by adults, and most come off a bit sappy and overly nostalgic.  This one is perfect.Johnny Depp, as he so often is, was masterful in his role as the shy, introverted, imaginative, and playful playwright J. M. Barrie.  Kate Winslet was bold and provocative as Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, the mother of the boys who provided the inspiration for  Barrie's play Peter Pan.But, in all honesty, I think top honors should go to Freddie Highmore,  Joe Prospero,  Nick Roud, and  Luke Spill, the boys who played Peter, Jack, George, and Michael Davies.  Freddie Highmore played Peter (not Peter Pan, but the real Peter) and I would have to say that he nearly stole the show.  For a child actor his performance was moving, vivid, and strikingly real. (He also has the lead child role in the upcoming Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, again plating with Depp.  Johnny was so impressed with Highmore performance's in Neverland that he insisted he be given the lead child role in Chocolate Factory as well.)The story is told through the eyes of Barrie as he befriends the young Davies boys, and despite the social objections which flutter around them, becomes their adopted uncle and spends his afternoons and evenings playing cowboys, pirates, kings, etc.These scenes of playful imagination are filmed in such as way that we are fully engulfed in their world of make believe, with occasional flashes back to reality to remind us that it is only pretend.  The flashes back and forth between imagination and reality are handled with just the right touch of reserve and taste.I can't emphasize enough how touching and magical this movie is.  It's an innocent and sweet look into the lives of three people:  One is an a creative and simple man caught between his desire to still be a kid and the world of adults in which he lives, one is lonely and stressed widow trying to raise four boys on her own, and the third is a scared little boy who's grieving for his father's death and must learn how to become a child again.I absolutely promise you will love ever second of it.

It was hard at first to accept Johnny Depp, taller than quite a number of the other actors, as the pint-sized Barrie, but he captures Barrie's whimsy so convincingly that one soon can look past this. Depp does reasonably a good job with his accents (I suppose if it is de rigeur for all Roman soldiers in movies to have British accents, then it is acceptable for a Scotsman to be played by an American) and draw you in enough to feel the pain of loss.I might have been tempted to give this only three stars, if not for the utterly stellar performance of Freddie Highmore as Peter Llewelyn Davies. Whenever he is on the screen, one is transfixed by his completely unaffected approach to the role. From what I have heard, Johnny Depp was mesmerized by Highmore's performance, and when it came time to make ""Charlie & the Chocolate Factory,"" wanted only Highmore for the role of Charlie. It is easy to see why.

879904,AU78WGAXA3IY1,B0007CNXUK,"Chelle ""Chelle""","[2, 2]","One wouldn't normally describe a film as being lovely, but it's the first word that comes to mind, well, mine at least, when trying to put together thoughts on Finding Neverland. The second, perhaps, would be sad. That last word, however, is misleading. In the context of this film, sadness is uplifting as it reaffirms one's belief in the power of believing.For as long as I can remember, the story behind a story/novel/poem/etc. has fascinated me. In the case of Peter Pan, it was the story of how Barrie came to fashion the Lost Boys, and the idea of a child who refused to grow up. I knew from reading a brief biography of Barrie that the loss of his brother at a young age had a severe effect on their mother, which impacted Barrie's own grief. And I was glad to see that that event was mentioned in this film, beautifully illustrating the idea that children should be children while they are able to, and that childhood can disappear, before its time, in the blink of an eye. This film is by no means a faithful biography of Barrie, but then I don't think it was meant to be. There is truth in certain aspects, but there are fabrications as well, which no doubt were intended to heighten the drama of the many relationships involved. As an example, the viewer comes to care a great deal about the unstated, but deeply felt, feelings that Barrie and Sylvia (the mother of the Davies boys) share, which wouldn't have been possible if the makers of the film had followed history and had Sylvia's husband alive as he actually was when the boys met Barrie. The feelings between those two make the ending that much more sad and rather bittersweet. I wouldn't have changed that for the world. Not even for the sake of being more true to life.The film, in its entirety, is quiet and bright, simple in its expression, but extremely meaningful. It obviously wasn't a lavish production and yet the scenes were rich and the settings nicely detailed. As a viewer, you don't doubt the authenticity of the time it is portraying, which adds overall credibility to the film.Now, onto the acting. Johnny Depp. Luckily for us, he always has something to offer. A film could be completely unremarkable and yet he manages to make his role unforgettable. Depp personifies the type of actor who slips into the skin of the character he is playing, learning him inside and out, who brings forth all of the mannerisms and quirks that speak of a greater understanding of humanity than most could hope for. But to put it more simply, it comes down to a matter of belief. I, myself, have never doubted him in any role. No matter the time period, or how fantastical his performance may seem, you believe in him. What a wonderful trait for the actor portraying Barrie to have. You believe in him. Kate Winslet, in her role, was wonderful. She exuded an inner happiness and faith and her presence on screen was just glowing. Towards the end of the film when she is viewing the play based on her boys, well, she has never been more beautiful. They couldn't have cast the role better. And as for the boys, each and every one was charming and deserving of recognition for their performances.Finding Neverland reminds us of the importance of imagination and wonder.

Anyone else might be crushed, but Barrie immediately sets out to write a new one.  While engrossed in this project, he unexpectedly encounters the four Llewellyn-Davies boys, George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Prospero), Peter (Freddie Highmore), and Michael (Luke Spill), whose mother Sylvia (Kate Winslet) was recently left a widow ""with hardly a penny"" (though she and her sons seem to live well enough).  A bond immediately forms between him and the boys--except for Peter, who has been left embittered by his father's death and unwilling to believe in anything, especially if it smells of fantasy--and he soon becomes ""Uncle Jim,"" playing with the quartet and even lending the family his summer cottage.  Though the supposed relationship with Sylvia causes something of a scandal and alienates his wife (Radha Mitchell), Barrie finds himself inspired by it and writes a new play of a kind never seen before: the story of a boy who never grows up.Depp's Barrie is a delightful ""boy-man"" with more than a touch of Captain Jack Sparrow about him (it's intriguing that he would have been cast as the creator of one of the best-known pirates in English literature), and the developing love of the four boys for this substitute father, plus the growing strain on his own marriage, is excellently done by all parties involved.  Dustin Hoffman appears as theatrical impresario Daniel Frohman, who's dubious about ""Peter Pan"" at first but takes the risk and, of course, finds he has an unprecedented hit on his hands.

The same holds true for Finding Neverland, which has a feel of an independent movie.The story takes place in 1903 and is about author J.M. Barrie (Depp) and how he became inspired to write the play ""Peter Pan.""  Basically he was at the park and met the Davies Family.  Sylvia (Kate Winslet) is the mom/widow of the family whom has four boys that she is responsible for.  James begins the hang out with the family on a regular basis.  He plays cowboys or pirates with the boys.  As he does this, he writes down all of his ideas and images, which eventually turns out to be ""Peter Pan.""Johnny Depp gaves an amazing performance.  I really hope that he gets his long over-due Oscar for this performance.  Everytime that he is in a movie, he makes it a better.  He is the perfect person to play the role of a grown man who doesn't want to grow up.  Kate Winslet also gives a good, dramatic performance.  Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman are also featured in this film and due well for having limited roles.The movies itself was really good.  It seems like the kind of movie that would get boring, but it actually didn't.  I was very interested in the movie the whole way through.  Marc Forster did an excellent job of directing this movie.  I especially like how he showed what James is thinking in his imagination.  Also the way the recreation of the original ""Peter Pan"" play is something to see.  Forster definately did his homework on the original ""Peter Pan"" play.So my recommendation is the check this movie out.  It is a very entertaining movie, that provides you with a good message.  Imagination is the greatest gift of all and to always try to find and keep alive the inner child in you.

Barrie got his inspiration for writing his most famous play, Peter Pan. But this moving film is not only about that, but also about the ways in which we deal with difficult times in our lives, and sadness, and most of all the power of imagination.Johnny Depp plays J.M. Barrie, who has reached a point in his life where he is struggling to write in a meaningful way that will connect with audiences. His latest play was a huge bomb, but promoter Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman) is willing to sink money into Barrie's productions regardless. Barrie spends his days in the park, where one day he meets the Davies family: mother Sylvia (Kate Winslet), and boys Jack (Joe Prospero), George (Nick Roud), Michael (Luke Spill), and the aloof Peter (Freddie Highmore), in whom James sees a lot of himself.James takes an instant shine to the boys and their mother, and when he learns that they have recently lost their father, and that Sylvia's health is also deteriorating, he begins spending more time with them. Their time together is spent pretending they are pirates and indians, and director Marc Forster uses an inventive approach here mixing shots of reality and the imaginary world within scenes.All this time they are spending together, however, creates a rift between James and his wife Mary (Radha Mitchell), who wishes he would spend more time with her, and is suspicious that he is carrying on an affair with Sylvia. Sylvia's mother (Julie Christie) is also jealous of the time James is spending with her grandchildren, and is suspicious of his motives. James contends that he just wants to be their friend, and we sense a mutual need from both the boys and Barrie. All this time, James is putting together his latest play, which is based on his experiences with the boys.As I said before, Finding Neverland is deeply moving in its depiction of the relationships between James, the boys, and Sylvia, and their respective needs to escape to a place James likes to call Neverland in order to cope with the sadness and emptiness in their lives. The film is not manipulative in evoking emotions from its viewers; it simply allows us to become familiar with these characters, and when sadness strikes, we truly feel for them.It would be great if none of these people ever had to find Neverland, but sometimes it's necessary to spend some time in a land of make believe in order to cope with the harshness of the real world.

I've seen it twice as of this review and liked it immensely more the second time. It helped that I now knew Freddie Highmore from his subsequent starring role in ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"" and it helped to watch this on my best TV which highlighted the magnificent cinematography in here.This is simply a beautifully-filmed movie, the DVD visuals stunning in parts, and a touching story that gets you involved and makes you think. It's nice to see Johnny Depp step out of character and play a clean-cut, wholesome-looking guy instead of some wacky weirdo. He did a great job of it, too, coming across as a very likable character: J.M. Barrie, the author of ""Peter Pan.""The story offers an interesting dilemma: was Barrie an innocent friend helping out a family desperately in need a father figure, or was he ""out of bounds"" spending too much time with another family while he had a wife sitting home alone? The answer is the latter, even though the movie slants in favor of the former. Despite Barrie's good intentions, his first commitment was still with his wife. However, he was so good with those four kids in this film that it's hard to totally find fault with him.Hightower is the youngest of four kids left without a dad. The older brothers are good kids and all of them are good actors. You rarely hear their real names, so here they are: Joe Prospero, Nick Road and Luke Spill.Kate Winslet plays the mother. I'm not a big fan of hers, but I have to give her her due....she, too, is excellent in this film. Radha Mitchell plays Barrie's wife and handles a tough situation in an interesting manner. Also in smaller-but-important roles are two big-name actors: Dustin Hoffman and Julie Christie.I really can't find much fault with this movie except that the first 30 minutes might be a little slow.

879916,AUHG8KSHI529U,B0007CNXUK,Craig Matteson,"[1, 2]","This is a beautiful film.  It is extremely well done and is a wonderful fantasy dedicated to the idea that what we wish life could be can be so if we only believe hard enough.  It is about the writing of Peter Pan by James Matthew Barrie.  We all know that world of make believe and magic this parable has for us as it has had for audiences and readers for more than 100 years.The movie says that its telling of this story is inspired by true events.  Yes, but with great liberties.  It is itself a fantasy of how the story ""should"" have been.  I won't bother telling you all the liberties taken with the way life actually was because you can simply search the web for Barrie's full name and find all the biographical detail you want, but like all facts it might destroy some of the beautiful wishing the movie inspires.  So, be careful what it is you want to know.The actors do a splendid job.  While I usually have mixed emotions about Johnny Depp, he is masterful in this performance.  Kate Winslet as the comsumptive Sylvia Llewelyn Davies makes the movie by being the foundation for Barrie's relationship with her boys, the true love of Barrie, however chaste, and the vehicle for the tragedy that makes the ending so poignant and strengthening the argument for making reality through belief.  Julie Christie plays Sylvia's mother who dislikes Barrie and does a great job as the  bucket of cold water on all this make believe stuff.  And Dustin Hoffman brings just the right touch as the good natured impresario who backs Barrie's plays without really understanding what Barrie is really about.So, this is a fable about Barrie and one you might prefer to believe to the reality of the man and the lives of those involved.  Yet, I think you can have both.  What is given us here is something worth experiencing and remembering.  However, it is only the story of the author of Peter Pan in the broad strokes.  Somehow, doesn't making a fantasy about the life of a person who could imagine Neverland seem perfectly appropriate?  Yes, but remembering what it was he really did and how things really happened is also important.But see this film.

Barrie such a brilliant fantasist is that he could see the world differently, as a child might and was not tied down by society's stuffy conventions. Finding Neverland (2004) is based loosely on an account of how he wrote his most cherished work, Peter Pan. The film was something of a critical darling and connected with audiences but came up short of many awards that year. Miramax hyped it to the sky (along with The Aviator) but is it really all that good or a classic example of the Emperor with no clothes?There is an audio commentary by director Marc Forster, producer Richard Gladstein and writer David Magee. Forster talks about technical details and the actors' performances while Magee speaks about the evolution of his screenplay, pointing out changes throughout the movie.""The Magic of Finding Neverland"" is a standard behind-the-scenes featurette. The cast and crew talk about what attracted them to the material and gush about working with Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet.""Creating Neverland"" is a brief look at the film's visual effects, showing how they pulled off one of the most ambitious shots in the production.""On the Red Carpet"" is a quick look at the various premieres that the cast attended all over the world with interviews as they make their way past the throngs of adoring fans and rabid media.There are three deleted scenes with optional commentary by Forster, Gladstein and Magee. They don't really add too much to the movie and were rightly cut.Finally, there is an ""Outtakes"" reel of blown lines and silly takes, including a dinner scene full of rude noises that were created in order to get the kids laughing spontaneously.Finding Neverland is a good movie full of charm and one that gradually works itself through your emotions to a climatic payoff that is heart-wrenching and hopeful at the same time. It's not a great film, hardly the Oscar heavyweight that Miramax hoped it would be. Voters must have realized this as well; it received very few statues on Oscar night. Still, one has to admire a movie that champions imagination in this day and age where everything is spelled out and shown to us in explicit detail.

The only problem is I've been touched this way before, and it was better.  There is a beautiful light found in the eyes of Kate Winslet who was robbed of the Oscar nomination for she was the far better actor of the two in question, and yet Depp was the only one to receive the nomination.The film, as everyone knows, is about J.M. Barrie (Depp), the writer of `Peter Pan' and it chronicles the events in his life that lead to the classic we all know and love.  Those events involve Widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Winslet) and her four boys, in particular Peter (Freddie Highmore).  Peter is struggling to recover from his father's death and dealing with his mothers growing illness and Barrie offers him a form of escape.  As I stated, Winslet does outstanding as the dieing woman who wants nothing more than a good life for her children, but I would feel wrong if not to mention the brilliant acting on young Freddie Highmore's part for he truly commanding the screen.I will admit when I first saw this film I was smitten by its charm and human appeal, and even now I still love this film.

The story is, of course, how Peter Pan came to be.  And though there may be some historical inaccuracies in the name of art, the story, acting and pretty much everything about this film is perfectly done.  Johnny Depp, who charmed his way into everyone's heart with his wickedly funny portrayal of Capt Jack Sparrow in the surprise hit, ""Pirates of the Carribean"", will no doubt win more hearts with this role. He is thoroughly charming as J. M. Barrie, a writer suffering from a couple of back to back flops in the theater world.  As fate would have it, he is out one day in the park and comes across a group of boys with their mother (the beautiful and talented Kate Winslet).  These boys steal Barrie's heart, especially the stoic Peter, who seems to be drowning in grief over the loss of his father.  In no time, he becomes ""Uncle James"" and spends more time with the boys and their Mom than he does at home.  This doesn't help his already suffering marriage; his wife has all been given up on the marriage by this time but ultimately gives the writer an ultimatum---her or the work.Depp's performance is extremely good and shows how he just gets better and better.  I would love to see him get an Academy Award nomination for this role.  Ms. Winslet is, as usual, perfect in her role as the adoring mom.  She too deserves a nomination though many feel if she gets a nod it will be for her earlier film, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"".  And though I doubt it will happen, it would be nice to see the young boy who played Peter get a supporting nod.Regardless of winning awards or not, this is my favorite film that was released in 2004.

879926,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B0007CNXUK,David A. Wend,"[1, 3]","Finding Neverland is a wonderful film with great performances.  But like so many film biographies the screenplay does not compare well to the real events concerning J. M. Barrie and the Llewelyn Davies boys (actually 5 instead of 4 and Barrie not only knew their father but was not liked by him).  Film, being vastly different than writing a full-length biography, has to take liberties to be  coherrant and tell a story. In creating the world of J. M. Barrie, ""Finding Neverland"" is a great success and is an  unforgetable movie.Johnny Depp is always fascinating to watch and here he makes J. M. Barrie into a genius searching for a direction in his life having had a play fail and a wife (Radha Mitchell) that treats their relationship coldly.  His inspiration comes from the recently widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four sons, with whom he builds the close relationship that is lacking in his life.  Through the many hours he spends with the boys, pretending to be pirates and Indians, the story of Peter Pan takes shape.  However, even as Barrie has found a semblance of family with the Llewelyn Davies' he is challenged by Sylvia's mother (Julie Christie) who finds the relationship inappropriate.  Coupled with this are the signs of illness Sylvia exhibits (and tries to hide) which makes this a sad and poignant story.The performances by Depp, Winslet and Christie save the film from an overly sweet tear-jerker.  The performance of Freddie Highmore as Peter is superb, and his character meshes perfectly with Johnny Depp's J.M. Barrie that one forgets the three other boys.  The production is also outstanding with excellent costumes and all of the details that help re-create Edwardian England.  The cinematography is beautiful but, indeed, it is the performances that make this a great film.",5,Magical Performances,1113350400,"04 13, 2005",2005,1823,"['Finding', 'Neverland', 'wonderful', 'film', 'great', 'performances', 'so', 'many', 'film', 'biographies', 'screenplay', 'not', 'compare', 'well', 'real', 'events', 'concerning', 'J.', 'M.', 'Barrie', 'Llewelyn', 'Davies', 'actually', '5', 'instead', '4', 'Barrie', 'not', 'only', 'knew', 'father', 'was', 'not', 'liked', 'Film', 'being', 'vastly', 'different', 'writing', 'full-length', 'biography', 'take', 'liberties', 'be', 'coherrant', 'tell', 'story', 'creating', 'world', 'J.', 'M.', 'Barrie', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'great', 'success', 'unforgetable', 'movie.Johnny', 'Depp', 'always', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'here', 'J.', 'M.', 'Barrie', 'genius', 'searching', 'direction', 'life', 'having', 'had', 'play', 'fail', 'wife', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'relationship', 'coldly', 'inspiration', 'recently', 'widowed', 'Sylvia', 'Llewelyn', 'Davies', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'four', 'sons', 'whom', 'close', 'relationship', 'lacking', 'life', 'many', 'hours', 'boys', 'pretending', 'be', 'pirates', 'Indians', 'story', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'shape', 'However', 'even', 'Barrie', 'found', 'semblance', 'family', 'Llewelyn', 'Davies', 'challenged', 'Sylvia', 'mother', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'who', 'relationship', 'inappropriate', 'Coupled', 'are', 'signs', 'illness', 'Sylvia', 'exhibits', 'hide', 'sad', 'poignant', 'story.The', 'performances', 'Depp', 'Winslet', 'Christie', 'save', 'film', 'overly', 'sweet', 'tear-jerker', 'performance', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'Peter', 'superb', 'character', 'meshes', 'perfectly', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'one', 'three', 'other', 'boys', 'production', 'also', 'outstanding', 'excellent', 'costumes', 'details', 'help', 're-create', 'Edwardian', 'England', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'indeed', 'performances', 'make', 'great', 'film']",Finding Neverland
879927,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B0007CNXUK,David Baldwin,"[5, 6]","When they were handicapping the Oscars this year ""Finding Neverland"" took up the rear.  In my book I ranked Marc Forster's film a shade behind ""The Aviator"" as the best film of the year.  This is an amazing film that demands our emotional involvement and earns it.  Johnny Depp is terrific as J.M. Barrie, a blocked playwright who finds inspiration through his relationship with a widow and her four boys.  In an understated way Depp manages to convey the inner workings of a man who learns to unloose his imagination and in the process create a work of lasting impact.  Kate Winslet is effervescent as Sylvia, a woman who is learning to enjoy life after great tragedy.  Radha Mitchell as Barrie's wife, Mary, gives dimension and empathy to a character that in lesser hands would have been villified.  The impression you are left with is that it is just as much the fault of James than Mary for the dissolution of their marriage.  Julie Christie also creates a full bodied character in the role of Sylvia's mother.  In lesser hands she could appear shrewish but Christie manages to convey that her character's stern demeanor is born from concern for her daughter and grandchildren's well-being and not some unbased malevolence.  The actors playing Sylvia's children are all excellent but special mention should go to Freddie Highsmore as Peter.  Of all the children in the film his character evolves the most psychologically and Highsmore gives a performance of great depth.  Ironically, you almost forget the prescence here of Dustin Hoffman as Barrie's producer.  Hoffman is good but this is not a particularly demanding part for him.",5,Best Ensemble of 2004,1111795200,"03 26, 2005",2005,1636,"['When', 'were', 'handicapping', 'Oscars', 'year', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'took', 'up', 'rear', 'book', 'ranked', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'film', 'shade', 'Aviator', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'amazing', 'film', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'terrific', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'blocked', 'playwright', 'who', 'inspiration', 'relationship', 'widow', 'four', 'boys', 'understated', 'way', 'Depp', 'convey', 'inner', 'workings', 'man', 'who', 'unloose', 'imagination', 'process', 'create', 'work', 'lasting', 'impact', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'effervescent', 'Sylvia', 'woman', 'who', 'learning', 'enjoy', 'life', 'great', 'tragedy', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Barrie', 'wife', 'Mary', 'dimension', 'empathy', 'character', 'lesser', 'hands', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'villified', 'impression', 'are', 'left', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'fault', 'James', 'Mary', 'dissolution', 'marriage', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'also', 'full', 'bodied', 'character', 'role', 'Sylvia', 'mother', 'lesser', 'hands', 'could', 'appear', 'shrewish', 'Christie', 'convey', 'character', 'stern', 'demeanor', 'born', 'concern', 'daughter', 'grandchildren', 'well-being', 'not', 'unbased', 'malevolence', 'actors', 'playing', 'Sylvia', 'children', 'are', 'excellent', 'special', 'mention', 'should', 'go', 'Freddie', 'Highsmore', 'Peter', 'children', 'film', 'character', 'most', 'psychologically', 'Highsmore', 'performance', 'great', 'depth', 'Ironically', 'almost', 'forget', 'prescence', 'here', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Barrie', 'producer', 'Hoffman', 'good', 'not', 'particularly', 'demanding', 'part']",Finding Neverland
879928,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B0007CNXUK,David E. Levine,"[1, 4]","I recently saw this movie on dvd, having previously seen the other four movies that had been nominated for the 2005 Academy Award as best picture. Yes, this was a good picture but, in my opinion, it was the weakest of the nominees. It is a relatively short movie (for some reason, many ""best pictures"" run on endlessly). Still, at times, I found the picture dragged and I was ready for it to end when it did. The movie is about JM Barrie's friendship with a widow and her young sons. The friendship puts a strain on his already shaky marriage. His friendship with the boys and his encouragement for them to use their imaginations is his inspiration for the great play that he authored; ""Peter Pan."" Barrie is played by Johnny Depp. One problem I have with the dvd is that Depp's affected English accent is difficult to understand. Look, I'm getting older; maybe my hearing isn't so good but, more and more, I find that acting in movies is done in conversational tones. I believe that a slight ""projection"" as opposed to whispers, murmers, and incomprehensible accents would not ruin the realism. Accordingly, having had to use subtitles, this dvd gets no more than four stars from me.Again, the story is charming and I thought Kate Winslet was great as the widow and, in a supporting role, Dustin Hoffman was supurb. Hoffman often plays sort of strange, oddball types but, his depiction of a conservative, somewhat cranky British drama agent was wonderful. What a fine actor he is!! He can step into so many different skins.Anyway, at times the movie drags a little and I could hear it but, it really was a charming story thus, I'll give it four stars.",4,Charming but not great,1115942400,"05 13, 2005",2005,1652,"['recently', 'saw', 'movie', 'dvd', 'having', 'previously', 'seen', 'other', 'four', 'movies', 'had', 'been', 'nominated', '2005', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'picture', 'Yes', 'was', 'good', 'picture', 'opinion', 'was', 'weakest', 'nominees', 'relatively', 'short', 'movie', 'reason', 'many', 'best', 'pictures', 'run', 'endlessly', 'Still', 'times', 'found', 'picture', 'dragged', 'was', 'ready', 'end', 'when', 'did', 'movie', 'JM', 'Barrie', 'friendship', 'widow', 'young', 'sons', 'friendship', 'strain', 'already', 'shaky', 'marriage', 'friendship', 'boys', 'encouragement', 'use', 'imaginations', 'inspiration', 'great', 'play', 'authored', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Barrie', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'One', 'problem', 'have', 'dvd', 'Depp', 'affected', 'English', 'accent', 'difficult', 'understand', 'Look', ""'m"", 'getting', 'older', 'maybe', 'hearing', ""n't"", 'so', 'good', 'more', 'more', 'find', 'acting', 'movies', 'done', 'conversational', 'tones', 'believe', 'slight', 'projection', 'opposed', 'whispers', 'murmers', 'incomprehensible', 'accents', 'would', 'not', 'ruin', 'realism', 'Accordingly', 'having', 'had', 'use', 'subtitles', 'dvd', 'more', 'four', 'stars', 'me.Again', 'story', 'charming', 'thought', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'was', 'great', 'widow', 'supporting', 'role', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'supurb', 'Hoffman', 'often', 'sort', 'strange', 'oddball', 'types', 'depiction', 'conservative', 'somewhat', 'cranky', 'British', 'drama', 'agent', 'was', 'wonderful', 'What', 'fine', 'actor', 'can', 'step', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'skins.Anyway', 'times', 'movie', 'little', 'could', 'hear', 'really', 'was', 'charming', 'story', 'thus', ""'ll"", 'give', 'four', 'stars']",Finding Neverland

Depp has demonstrated over and over he is a multitalented actor who is best adapted to playing eccentric and/or magical men whether they sail pirate ships, delve in chocolate, or sculpt ice.  In this film the svelte Depp depicts the robust JM Barrie, author of Peter Pan and creator of Neverland.  Kate Winslett is counterpart, looks wonderful wearing the fashions from the early 20th century-large hats and big skirts- whether she plays an American heiress, an impoverished widow or an Oxford scholar. And, she can act, so her characters are poignant and believable, and the interaction is real.  Julie Christie as Winslett's mother is as beautiful as ever, while appearing maternal and stern. Dustin Hoffman is a wonderful foil to Depp as he plays the somewhat rational producer of his magical play. The little boys who play Winslett's sons and who along with their mother inspire the work are absolutely swell.My sister warned me that the book and film were tear-jerkers, and the film is at least a three-hankie affair. It is also a beautiful magical film and I found myself saying ""I believe in fairies"" more than once, but particularly when Tinkerbell drinks the poisoned medicine to save Peter. The message, ""What your mind can conceive and believe it will achieve"" is stressed, although all the characters discover that denying something won't make it go away.These days, I ""screen"" everything before I buy it, so I watched the rented version of the film, however, I like this DVD enough to buy it.",4,When things aren't the way you want them to be......there's magic,1127001600,"09 18, 2005",2005,1568,"['FINDING', 'NEVERLAND', 'starring', 'actor', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'winner', 'Depp', 'demonstrated', 'multitalented', 'actor', 'who', 'best', 'adapted', 'playing', 'eccentric', 'and/or', 'magical', 'men', 'sail', 'pirate', 'ships', 'delve', 'chocolate', 'sculpt', 'ice', 'film', 'svelte', 'Depp', 'robust', 'JM', 'Barrie', 'author', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'creator', 'Neverland', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'counterpart', 'wonderful', 'wearing', 'fashions', 'early', '20th', 'century-large', 'hats', 'big', 'skirts-', 'American', 'heiress', 'impoverished', 'widow', 'Oxford', 'scholar', 'can', 'act', 'characters', 'are', 'poignant', 'believable', 'interaction', 'real', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Winslett', 'mother', 'as', 'beautiful', 'ever', 'appearing', 'maternal', 'stern', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'wonderful', 'foil', 'Depp', 'somewhat', 'rational', 'producer', 'magical', 'play', 'little', 'boys', 'who', 'play', 'Winslett', 'sons', 'who', 'mother', 'inspire', 'work', 'are', 'absolutely', 'swell.My', 'sister', 'warned', 'book', 'film', 'were', 'tear-jerkers', 'film', 'least', 'three-hankie', 'affair', 'also', 'beautiful', 'magical', 'film', 'found', 'saying', 'believe', 'fairies', 'more', 'once', 'particularly', 'when', 'Tinkerbell', 'poisoned', 'medicine', 'save', 'Peter', 'message', 'What', 'mind', 'can', 'conceive', 'believe', 'will', 'achieve', 'stressed', 'characters', 'discover', 'denying', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'go', 'away.These', 'days', 'screen', 'everything', 'buy', 'so', 'watched', 'rented', 'version', 'film', 'however', 'like', 'DVD', 'enough', 'buy']",Finding Neverland

I have made that ""mistake"" before, but thought my chances of disliking this movie were close to zero.  I am a big fan of Johnny Depp and love Kate Winslet, as well.  The story was also intriguing to me... so, although I have learned never to expect much of anything I get my hopes up about, I bought this feeling as if it had incredible potential.I was pleasantly surprised to find that this movie lived up to exactly what I hoped it to be... clever, well acted, inspirational, imaginative, visually stunning, and an overall treat with a powerful ending.  What a rare surprise, a movie lived up to my expectations and delivered!I have heard several things about the innacurracies of historical events, but the spirit and the emotional impact were spot on and the historical ""error"" (although I believe it was deliberate), is completely irrelevant in my mind - in fact, it appears necessary in order to fully portray this story's significance in less than 2 hours.Johnny Depp has proven himself, yet again.  In fact, with a list of great acting credits, this ranks up with one of his best, in my mind.  It is worth pointing out that the story is driven by dialogue and the character relationships, so - although there is nothing innappropriate for child minds, it may appear a bit slow and cause them to lose interest - although my three year old loved the ending!  This, I think, explains many of the poor ratings that this movie has received on Amazon - but dont let those ""bored""  by this movie fool you!This movie is inspiring and does what it intends to do - bring out the child in your heart; so long as you believe!

Like Michael Jackson, James Barrie refused to grow up and was only really comfortable with children.The Davis family, when he met them, was not reeling from the loss of a father.  Their father was perfectly alive and became increasingly upset by the way Barrie, with his celebrity, wealth and charm, wormed himself into Davis' sons'and wife's affections.  Why the hell do you think they left the man out of the movie?  Because it would have spoiled the warm and fuzzy story they wanted to put over.James Barrie never had a ""normal"" relationship with a woman, not even his wife who did leave him, not because he found a more meaningful relationship with Sylvia Davis but because he could never be a real husband.He did end up as a guardian to the boys after the deaths of their parents but the boys, as they grew up, came to understand how intrusive Barrie had been in their lives and they resented him for it.  His influence on them was not good.  They did not regard him fondly.  He used them selfishly for his own emotional and creative purposes and they knew it.Peter Pan was the result.  It is a work of genius but it has a dark side as anyone who actually reads the work can attest.  As the little boy in the movie said, it was Barrie himself who was really Peter Pan.  In the context of the movie it was supposed to be a compliment but in real life it was tragic.That one moment, however, was the closest this movie comes to the truth of the work of art that is ""Peter Pan"" and to the heart of its creator.

879937,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B0007CNXUK,D. S. Thurlow,"[2, 2]","2004's ""Finding Neverland"" is a gentle dramatization of the playwright James Barrie's relationship with a widow and her four young sons, out of which will be born the timeless classic story of Peter Pan.  The movie successfully walks a challenging tightrope between comedy and tragedy, as childhood clashes with adult realities.Johnny Depp is pitch-perfect as James M. Barrie, a imaginative Scottish writer with a failed play and an unraveling marriage on his hands.  Walking his dog in a London Park, he encounters the four adventurous children of recently widowed Sylvia Llewlyn Davies (Kate Winslet).  His efforts to entertain the children are gratefully welcomed by an overstretched Sylvia.  Putting on fantasy games involving dancing bears, pirates and indians for the boys seems to recharge Barrie's own creative batteries.Barrie spends increasing time with Sylvia and the boys, in the process scandalizing the local gossips, pushing his already unhappy wife (Radha Mitchell) to the edge, and bringing down the wrath of Sylvia's suspicious mother (Julie Christie).  His theater producer (Dustin Hoffman in a comically crusty turn) is openly skeptical that Barrie's new play, about a boy who refuses to grow up, will attract an audience.  To complicate the situation, Barrie's efforts to bring off the play begin to collide with Sylvia's mysteriously deteriorating health.  The stage is set for a very dramatic and emotional opening night.In spite of the attractive fantasy elements of the story, this is a tough love movie.  Barrie, thrust into the role of de facto father, must teach the children the realities of the adult world without prematurely destroying their childhood.  Barrie and Sylvia walk a delicate line, balancing their shared concern for the children and their respective needs for emotional support, against the lack of any socially sanctioned basis for their relationship.  Barrie must also deal forthrightly with his failures in his own marriage.""Finding Neverland"" is a small window into the theater world of 1903, where ""Peter Pan"" was a remarkably innovative production.  The rehearsals for the play provide comic relief, while its opening night brings together multiple plots threads.  ""Finding Neverland"" is very highly recommended as a entertaining movie, especially for those with their own childhood memories of Peter Pan.",5,Tough Love....,1212883200,"06 8, 2008",2008,2356,"['2004', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'gentle', 'dramatization', 'playwright', 'James', 'Barrie', 'relationship', 'widow', 'four', 'young', 'sons', 'will', 'be', 'born', 'timeless', 'classic', 'story', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'movie', 'successfully', 'challenging', 'tightrope', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'childhood', 'clashes', 'adult', 'realities.Johnny', 'Depp', 'pitch-perfect', 'James', 'M.', 'Barrie', 'imaginative', 'Scottish', 'writer', 'failed', 'play', 'unraveling', 'marriage', 'hands', 'Walking', 'dog', 'London', 'Park', 'four', 'adventurous', 'children', 'recently', 'widowed', 'Sylvia', 'Llewlyn', 'Davies', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'efforts', 'entertain', 'children', 'are', 'gratefully', 'welcomed', 'overstretched', 'Sylvia', 'Putting', 'fantasy', 'games', 'involving', 'dancing', 'bears', 'pirates', 'indians', 'boys', 'recharge', 'Barrie', 'own', 'creative', 'batteries.Barrie', 'increasing', 'time', 'Sylvia', 'boys', 'process', 'scandalizing', 'local', 'gossips', 'pushing', 'already', 'unhappy', 'wife', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'edge', 'bringing', 'down', 'wrath', 'Sylvia', 'suspicious', 'mother', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'theater', 'producer', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'comically', 'crusty', 'turn', 'openly', 'skeptical', 'Barrie', 'new', 'play', 'boy', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'will', 'attract', 'audience', 'complicate', 'situation', 'Barrie', 'efforts', 'bring', 'off', 'play', 'begin', 'collide', 'Sylvia', 'mysteriously', 'deteriorating', 'health', 'stage', 'set', 'very', 'dramatic', 'emotional', 'opening', 'night.In', 'spite', 'attractive', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'story', 'tough', 'love', 'movie', 'Barrie', 'thrust', 'role', 'de', 'facto', 'father', 'must', 'teach', 'children', 'realities', 'adult', 'world', 'prematurely', 'destroying', 'childhood', 'Barrie', 'Sylvia', 'walk', 'delicate', 'line', 'balancing', 'shared', 'concern', 'children', 'respective', 'needs', 'emotional', 'support', 'lack', 'socially', 'sanctioned', 'basis', 'relationship', 'Barrie', 'must', 'also', 'deal', 'forthrightly', 'failures', 'own', 'marriage', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'small', 'window', 'theater', 'world', '1903', 'where', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'was', 'remarkably', 'innovative', 'production', 'rehearsals', 'play', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'opening', 'night', 'together', 'multiple', 'plots', 'threads', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'especially', 'own', 'childhood', 'memories', 'Peter', 'Pan']",Finding Neverland

The story of ""Finding Neverland"" was inspired by the life of author/playwright James M. Barrie who is played by the talented Johnny Depp. While I wasn't convinced by his Scottish accent, Johnny makes up for it with is moving performance as a child trapped in a man's body. Stuck in a loveless marriage and trying to recover from a failed play, James Barrie meets widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (played by the lovely Kate Winslet) and her four boys and immediately strikes up a genuine platonic friendship with the widow and her boys. James' friendship with the Davies brothers quickly inspire him to create what would eventually evolve into the story of Peter Pan.There were a few changes made in James M. Barrie's story but this film never claimed to be an actual documentary or docudrama of Barrie's life. That aside, ""Finding Neverland"" was a truly moving film. The gorgeous orchestral film score Jan A.P Kaczmarek helped the film the emotional impact especially the last fifteen minutes of the film. All of the actors involved with the film gave wonderful performances especially Kate Winslet and Freddie Highmore.The dvd has some excellent bonus features like outtakes which were hilarious and behind the scene footage.

879941,A7R8B1TI25ITH,B0007CNXUK,E. Cummins,"[4, 5]","GothamGirl and another reviewer on here who gave low ratings seem to miss the point of the movie.To the reviewer who gave a rating of 1 Star, of course there aren't going to be any real pirates in this or a shot gun blast to the chest. This movie has to do with how playwright J.M. Barrie came up with the idea for writing Peter Pan. So it makes perfect sense that there would be kids and grown-ups dressed up as pirates and such in this movie. If you were going into this movie thinking it would be like Depp's last movie Pirate of the Carribean, than you probably shouldn't have gone to see this.To GothamGirl, yes, the movie can be a bit slow but personally I wouldn't have preferred it any other way than to have the movie focus on Barrie and his wife. It's the estrangement between him and his wife that causes him to form this frienship with four boys and their widow mother. And actually, I felt the movie did a wonderful job of balancing the focus between Barrie and his wife as well as with Winslet's character and her family of four boys.Now on to the movie, lol. First off definitely gotta say that I loved this movie and will be adding it to my DVD library when it comes out to DVD on March 22. The tear jerkers come more towards the end, but it's still a very touching movie and certainly filled with a lot of magic, imagination and wonder. Depp as always does a great job and I become more and more a fan of his with each movie I see (looking forward to the Burton movie of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory that he's doing and the sequel to Pirates Of The Carribean). Depp's Scottish accent was perfect (at first I thought the accent was Irish since I hadn't realized that Barrie is originally Scottish). Freddy Sizemore is incredible as a boy who demands to grow up as quickly as possible so as not to feel the pain that children feel when losing a loved one like a parent(s). Sizemore was just incredibly talented in this film, which leads me to believe we can expect more great things from him as he gets older not too mention seeing more of his talent as Charlie Bucket in Tim Burton's version of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory.I definitely recommend this movie for the entire family to watch, but be sure to have some tissues ready.",5,'Finding Neverland' A Magical Experience,1110758400,"03 14, 2005",2005,2255,"['GothamGirl', 'reviewer', 'here', 'who', 'gave', 'low', 'ratings', 'seem', 'miss', 'point', 'movie.To', 'reviewer', 'who', 'gave', 'rating', '1', 'Star', 'course', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'real', 'pirates', 'shot', 'gun', 'blast', 'chest', 'movie', 'do', 'how', 'playwright', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'writing', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'perfect', 'sense', 'would', 'be', 'kids', 'grown-ups', 'dressed', 'up', 'pirates', 'such', 'movie', 'were', 'going', 'movie', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'Depp', 'last', 'movie', 'Pirate', 'Carribean', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'gone', 'see', 'this.To', 'GothamGirl', 'yes', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'slow', 'personally', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'preferred', 'other', 'way', 'have', 'movie', 'focus', 'Barrie', 'wife', 'estrangement', 'wife', 'form', 'frienship', 'four', 'boys', 'widow', 'mother', 'actually', 'felt', 'movie', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'balancing', 'focus', 'Barrie', 'wife', 'as', 'well', 'Winslet', 'character', 'family', 'four', 'boys.Now', 'movie', 'lol', 'First', 'off', 'definitely', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'loved', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'adding', 'DVD', 'library', 'when', 'out', 'DVD', 'March', '22', 'tear', 'jerkers', 'come', 'more', 'towards', 'end', 'still', 'very', 'touching', 'movie', 'certainly', 'filled', 'lot', 'magic', 'imagination', 'wonder', 'Depp', 'always', 'great', 'job', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'fan', 'movie', 'see', 'looking', 'forward', 'Burton', 'movie', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'doing', 'sequel', 'Pirates', 'Carribean', 'Depp', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'was', 'perfect', 'first', 'thought', 'accent', 'was', 'Irish', 'had', ""n't"", 'realized', 'Barrie', 'originally', 'Scottish', 'Freddy', 'Sizemore', 'incredible', 'boy', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'so', 'not', 'feel', 'pain', 'children', 'feel', 'when', 'losing', 'loved', 'one', 'parent', 's', 'Sizemore', 'was', 'just', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'film', 'believe', 'can', 'expect', 'more', 'great', 'things', 'older', 'not', 'too', 'mention', 'seeing', 'more', 'talent', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'version', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory.I', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'entire', 'family', 'watch', 'be', 'sure', 'have', 'tissues', 'ready']",Finding Neverland

879943,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0007CNXUK,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 3]","It's no wonder Michael Jackson is drawn to Peter Pan and the concept of Neverland from this 2004 romanticized telling of playwright James M. Barrie's attachment to the Llewelyn Davies family as the inspiration for his classic play. Director Marc Forster, whose only other credit I know is the melodramatic and overrated ""Monster's Ball"", draws fine performances from his cast, but the film itself is oddly uninvolving at least until the last twenty minutes. Forster, along with screenwriter David Magee, takes a rather reverential attitude toward their subject, and this beatific sense is heightened by the immaculate approach toward the production.The result seems targeted squarely at the Merchant-Ivory connoisseur of good taste, but somewhere along the way, the edges have been dulled, and the intensity of feeling that Barrie has for the boys has been mollified for a broader audience. Fortunately, Johnny Depp has been ideally cast as Barrie mimicking a convincing Scottish accent in a surprisingly restrained performance. Even so, his unsullied playfulness comes through in his scenes with the children even if they tend to go on ad nauseam. Looking almost too radiant with an innate inability to convey fragility, Kate Winslet has the saintly role of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, the sickly mother who lives selflessly for her boys while in self-denial about her undisclosed illness.Even more thankless is the role of Barrie's social climbing wife Mary played in an overly pinched manner by Radha Mitchell (take a look at the outtakes to see a much livelier actress at work). Because her character is drawn in such shallow strokes, the unspoken love implied between Barrie and Sylvia seems all the more distracting from the main point of the story, the parallel between life and fantasy in Barrie's writing of ""Peter Pan"". Unbelievably nearly forty years since her enigmatic Lara in David Lean's ""Doctor Zhivago"", Julie Christie plays the predictable part of Sylvia's unyielding, Gladys Cooper-type mother with conviction, supposedly the inspiration for Captain Hook. I only wish her character was developed more to match her well-missed talent. In an even smaller role, Dustin Hoffman plays money-conscious impresario Charles Frohman with welcome panache.All four boys are effortless though the standout is Freddie Highmore, who plays the pivotal role of third son Peter. He plaintively lends the gravity of a serious child recovering from his father's death and unwillingly in the throes of a man consumed with fantasy, especially poignant in the closing scene with Depp. The recreation of the original production of ""Peter Pan"" is done well, even the fanciful scenes toward the end. I also think credit is due to composer Jan A.P. Kaczmarek, who provides an ethereal and evocative musical score.The DVD has the standard set of extras. Forster, Magee and producer Richard Gladstein - though sadly none of the actors - provide informative commentary on an alternate audio track. There are three deleted scenes and about five minutes worth of outtakes which frankly could have blessedly goosed the pacing of the film. Of course, there is the expected making-of featurette, ""The Magic of Finding Neverland"" but also a quick film on the film's special effects which could have been much longer and a stars-on-the-red-carpet clip that is completely disposable.",3,"If You Believe, Clap Your Hands...But Wait Until the Final Twenty Poignant Minutes",1130976000,"11 3, 2005",2005,3360,"['wonder', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'drawn', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'concept', 'Neverland', '2004', 'romanticized', 'telling', 'playwright', 'James', 'M.', 'Barrie', 'attachment', 'Llewelyn', 'Davies', 'family', 'inspiration', 'classic', 'play', 'Director', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'only', 'other', 'credit', 'know', 'melodramatic', 'overrated', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'fine', 'performances', 'cast', 'film', 'oddly', 'uninvolving', 'least', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'Forster', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Magee', 'rather', 'reverential', 'attitude', 'subject', 'beatific', 'sense', 'heightened', 'immaculate', 'approach', 'production.The', 'result', 'targeted', 'squarely', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'connoisseur', 'good', 'taste', 'somewhere', 'way', 'edges', 'have', 'been', 'dulled', 'intensity', 'feeling', 'Barrie', 'boys', 'been', 'mollified', 'broader', 'audience', 'Fortunately', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'been', 'ideally', 'cast', 'Barrie', 'mimicking', 'convincing', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'surprisingly', 'restrained', 'performance', 'Even', 'so', 'unsullied', 'playfulness', 'through', 'scenes', 'children', 'even', 'tend', 'go', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'Looking', 'almost', 'too', 'radiant', 'innate', 'inability', 'convey', 'fragility', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'saintly', 'role', 'Sylvia', 'Llewelyn', 'Davies', 'sickly', 'mother', 'who', 'selflessly', 'boys', 'self-denial', 'undisclosed', 'illness.Even', 'more', 'thankless', 'role', 'Barrie', 'social', 'climbing', 'wife', 'Mary', 'played', 'overly', 'pinched', 'manner', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'take', 'look', 'outtakes', 'see', 'much', 'livelier', 'actress', 'work', 'character', 'drawn', 'such', 'shallow', 'strokes', 'unspoken', 'love', 'implied', 'Barrie', 'Sylvia', 'more', 'distracting', 'main', 'point', 'story', 'parallel', 'life', 'fantasy', 'Barrie', 'writing', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Unbelievably', 'nearly', 'forty', 'years', 'enigmatic', 'Lara', 'David', 'Lean', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'predictable', 'part', 'Sylvia', 'unyielding', 'Gladys', 'Cooper-type', 'mother', 'conviction', 'supposedly', 'inspiration', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'only', 'wish', 'character', 'was', 'developed', 'more', 'match', 'well-missed', 'talent', 'even', 'smaller', 'role', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'money-conscious', 'impresario', 'Charles', 'Frohman', 'welcome', 'panache.All', 'four', 'boys', 'are', 'effortless', 'standout', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'who', 'pivotal', 'role', 'third', 'son', 'Peter', 'plaintively', 'gravity', 'serious', 'child', 'recovering', 'father', 'death', 'unwillingly', 'throes', 'man', 'consumed', 'fantasy', 'especially', 'poignant', 'closing', 'scene', 'Depp', 'recreation', 'original', 'production', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'done', 'well', 'even', 'fanciful', 'scenes', 'end', 'also', 'think', 'credit', 'due', 'composer', 'Jan', 'A.P', 'Kaczmarek', 'who', 'ethereal', 'evocative', 'musical', 'score.The', 'DVD', 'standard', 'set', 'extras', 'Forster', 'Magee', 'producer', 'Richard', 'Gladstein', 'sadly', 'none', 'actors', 'provide', 'informative', 'commentary', 'alternate', 'audio', 'track', 'are', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'five', 'minutes', 'outtakes', 'frankly', 'could', 'have', 'blessedly', 'goosed', 'pacing', 'film', 'course', 'expected', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'Magic', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'also', 'quick', 'film', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'longer', 'stars-on-the-red-carpet', 'clip', 'completely', 'disposable']",Finding Neverland

879946,AC9B29BXXWJHD,B0007CNXUK,Ellis Bell,"[1, 1]","Finding Neverland is the story of JM Barrie and the four children who helped inspire the story of Peter Pan. The opening credits tell us that the movie is based upon real events, but warn the reader that what occurs in Finding Neverland is actually factual. In fact, there are a lot of historical inaccuracies. Many of them are liberties taken by the screenwriter: Arthur Davies was still alive at the time this story takes place; these events occurred over a period of about 10 years, rather than a few months, as the movie suggests; and there were actually five Davies boys, not four. There's also some artistic license taken with the casting of Barrie; in real life he was only about five feet tall, whereas Johnny Depp is of course much taller. Also an invention were the orphans invited to the opening night of Peter Pan so that they might help get the rest of the audience to get into the premise of the play. Forgive me for making such a crass analogy, but Finding Neverland is rather like the movie Moulin Rouge; one is asked to suspend belief with regards to how true-to-life the movie is. Which neither is.One must concentrate instead on the message that the movie tries to convey. George, Jack, Peter and Michael meet JM Barrie (played by Johnny Depp) and his sheepdog in Kensington Gardens one day while playing make-believe (in real life this event took place when Peter was still in diapers and before Michael and the youngest boy, Nicholas, were even born). JM Barrie, who in real life was unable to connect well with adults, and who was not guilty of the pedophilic accusations directed at him in recent times, spends most of his waking hours playing with the boys, much to the consternation of his wife and the boys' grandmother, played by Julie Christie.A recent play of Barrie's has been a flop; but, due to the Davies boys, Barrie gets inspiration for his latest venture, Peter Pan. All the boys' names were used for the play: George and Michael for the Darling boys; Jack for a lost boy; and Peter for Peter Pan himself. The real-life Peter is the most sensitive of the Llewellyn-Davies boys; and he is the one Barrie bonds with the most, and the one Barrie encourages to write his own stories. This movie is all about believing- not just in having an imagination, but in believing about yourself as well. There's a downturn in the plot when a major character dies; but for the most part this is a movie with an excellent script and wonderful characters as well as actors. The real story of the Llewellyn-Davies boys is too sad; I'd rather believe the movie version.",4,One of those movies I could watch over and over...,1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,2587,"['Finding', 'Neverland', 'story', 'JM', 'Barrie', 'four', 'children', 'who', 'helped', 'inspire', 'story', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'opening', 'credits', 'tell', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'warn', 'reader', 'what', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'actually', 'factual', 'fact', 'are', 'lot', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'Many', 'are', 'liberties', 'taken', 'screenwriter', 'Arthur', 'Davies', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'time', 'story', 'place', 'events', 'occurred', 'period', '10', 'years', 'rather', 'few', 'months', 'movie', 'were', 'actually', 'five', 'Davies', 'boys', 'not', 'four', 'also', 'artistic', 'license', 'taken', 'casting', 'Barrie', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'only', 'about', 'five', 'feet', 'tall', 'whereas', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'course', 'much', 'taller', 'Also', 'invention', 'were', 'orphans', 'invited', 'opening', 'night', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'might', 'help', 'get', 'rest', 'audience', 'get', 'premise', 'play', 'Forgive', 'making', 'such', 'crass', 'analogy', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'rather', 'movie', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'one', 'asked', 'suspend', 'belief', 'regards', 'how', 'true-to-life', 'movie', 'Which', 'is.One', 'must', 'concentrate', 'instead', 'message', 'movie', 'convey', 'George', 'Jack', 'Peter', 'Michael', 'meet', 'JM', 'Barrie', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'sheepdog', 'Kensington', 'Gardens', 'one', 'day', 'playing', 'make-believe', 'real', 'life', 'event', 'took', 'place', 'when', 'Peter', 'was', 'still', 'diapers', 'Michael', 'youngest', 'boy', 'Nicholas', 'were', 'even', 'born', 'JM', 'Barrie', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'unable', 'connect', 'well', 'adults', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'guilty', 'pedophilic', 'accusations', 'directed', 'recent', 'times', 'most', 'waking', 'hours', 'playing', 'boys', 'much', 'consternation', 'wife', 'boys', 'grandmother', 'played', 'Julie', 'Christie.A', 'recent', 'play', 'Barrie', 'been', 'flop', 'due', 'Davies', 'Barrie', 'inspiration', 'latest', 'venture', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'boys', 'names', 'were', 'used', 'play', 'George', 'Michael', 'Darling', 'boys', 'Jack', 'lost', 'boy', 'Peter', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'real-life', 'Peter', 'most', 'sensitive', 'Llewellyn-Davies', 'boys', 'one', 'Barrie', 'bonds', 'most', 'one', 'Barrie', 'write', 'own', 'stories', 'movie', 'believing-', 'not', 'just', 'having', 'imagination', 'believing', 'about', 'as', 'well', 'downturn', 'plot', 'when', 'major', 'character', 'dies', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'excellent', 'script', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'actors', 'real', 'story', 'Llewellyn-Davies', 'boys', 'too', 'sad', ""'d"", 'rather', 'believe', 'movie', 'version']",Finding Neverland

879948,A1655SGPPUUCRP,B0007CNXUK,Emily Todd,"[1, 2]","Director Marc Forster's ""Finding Neverland"" is a truly charming, moving, and powerful biographic film of Peter Pan writer J.M. Barrie, played impressively by the great Johnny Depp.  Though ""Finding Neverland"" does take some liberties in the life of Barrie, for the most part, the film is entirely factual, which makes the tragic story even more affecting.  Balancing tear-jerking sentimentality with moments of childlike (and I mean ""childlike"" in the bets possible way) delight and warm humor, Forster has created a nearly flawless film that can be enjoyed on many different levels by young and old alike.My whole family went to see ""Finding Neverland"" the day before Christmas Eve and we all left the theater teary-eyed yet utterly satisfied with what we all consider to be one of the best films of the year.  Though it never actually mentions the holidays, ""Finding Neverland"" is the perfect holiday film as it embodies many of the ideas associated with the season: the ability to retain childlike optimism and hope, the notion that people are essentially good if you trust and encourage them, and the faith that a life after death will reunite believers.Johnny Depp's giddy sense of childlike glee and innocence is so incredibly genuine that it really brings the audience into the world of Barrie. Depp's brilliant performance helps us to understand Barrie's eccentric person by remaining sweet and rueful while suggesting unseen emotional depths.  It is also fascinating to see the reason behind the common theme of many of Barrie's plays; seeking in art a happiness we cannot sustain in life.",5,"""Unlock your imagination.""",1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,1598,"['Director', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'truly', 'charming', 'moving', 'powerful', 'biographic', 'film', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'writer', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'played', 'impressively', 'great', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'take', 'liberties', 'life', 'Barrie', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'entirely', 'factual', 'tragic', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'affecting', 'Balancing', 'tear-jerking', 'sentimentality', 'moments', 'childlike', 'mean', 'childlike', 'bets', 'possible', 'way', 'delight', 'warm', 'humor', 'Forster', 'created', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'young', 'old', 'alike.My', 'whole', 'family', 'went', 'see', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'day', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'left', 'theater', 'teary-eyed', 'yet', 'utterly', 'satisfied', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'never', 'actually', 'holidays', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'perfect', 'holiday', 'film', 'many', 'ideas', 'associated', 'season', 'ability', 'retain', 'childlike', 'optimism', 'hope', 'notion', 'people', 'are', 'essentially', 'good', 'trust', 'encourage', 'faith', 'life', 'death', 'will', 'reunite', 'believers.Johnny', 'Depp', 'giddy', 'sense', 'childlike', 'glee', 'innocence', 'so', 'incredibly', 'genuine', 'really', 'audience', 'world', 'Barrie', 'Depp', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'understand', 'Barrie', 'eccentric', 'person', 'remaining', 'sweet', 'rueful', 'suggesting', 'unseen', 'emotional', 'depths', 'also', 'fascinating', 'see', 'reason', 'common', 'theme', 'many', 'Barrie', 'plays', 'seeking', 'art', 'happiness', 'can', 'not', 'sustain', 'life']",Finding Neverland

I just went into the film just to be entertained. I wasn't really concerned with how much or little truth to the story is. I just really wanted to see if the praise over the film is worthy.Johnny Depp plays the struggling playwright James Barrie whose plays just never finds the right audience. His overactive imagination doesn't find an audience. Radha Mitchell (of ""Pitch Black"") plays his wife Mary. One day Johnny meets the widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four boys in the park. This quickly leads to a close friendship thanks to James' vivid imagination. Of course this does not sit well with Mary or Sylvia's mother Emma (Julie Christie) who wants Sylvia to remarry into high society. She also does not care for J.M Barrie. She feels that a man his age should not be playing with children, as does J.M's wife. The four boys are precocious as is James Barrie. The five have a rollicking good time together. In the beginning the second youngest son Peter is wary of James Barrie because he is still mourning over the loss of his father. With a little gentle prodding, James manages to get Peter to open up.I immensely enjoyed the film. It had that same whimsical feel that I would get from a Tim Burton movie (like 2003's ""Big Fish""). While his British accent wasn't completely convincing to me, Johnny Depp still managed to put in a superb performance as James Barrie. His chemistry with the young lads were hilarious. I especially loved the scene when they were in the country pretending to be pirates. I loved the vivid scenes of the actors on the pirate ship but I especially loved the last ten-fifteen minutes of the film which involved a performance of ""Peter Pan"". I didn't think it was possible but Kate Winslet managed to put in an even a more incredible performance in this film after last year's wonderful ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". Her final scenes in the film literally brought tears to my eyes. Julie Christie was brilliant as Sylvia's overbearing mother. The young lads in the film were a delight to watch, especially Freddie Highmore as Peter. I think we will be seeing more of Freddie in the near future after this film.Despite Johnny Depp's unconvincing Scottish accent, I pretty much found ""Finding Neverland"" flawless. I forgot the last time I became so emotional during a movie. The last fifteen minutes of the film was so heartbreaking I found myself all choked up. I was truly moved. ""Finding Neverland"" is a great film for people of all ages. It is certainly one of the best films from last year that I have seen.The bonus dvd features are excellent. I especially loved the outtakes which I found to be hilarious. The behind the scenes footage was equally wonderful. I especially enjoyed watching the actors discuss their roles in ""The Magic of Finding Neverland"". There are also a few deleted scenes included.

Yes, usually I find the deep, emotional, dramatic films boring and dull; but, except for a minor bout of yawn-induction, ""Finding Neverland"" is an interesting and touching drama starring one of Hollywood's current superstars: Johnny Depp.""Finding Neverland"" is the (almost) entirely true story of how English playwright James Matthew Barrie was inspired to write his most famous play:  ""Peter Pan"".  Interestingly enough, it was originally scheduled to premiere last year, which would have been about the same time as the latest movie rendition of Barrie's famous play hit theaters.  Ultimately, ""Peter Pan"" didn't pan out (har!) too well, but at the time Columbia Pictures refused to allow Miramax to use portions of the play if the movies were released at the same time, so the film was held for a year.  ""Finding Neverland"" premiered in the larger cities months ago, but has recently gotten a lot of Oscar buzz, so our humble theater has begun showing it here.As the story goes, J. M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) was inspired to create a story of children who didn't grow up by the Llewelyn Davies boys: George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Prospero), Michael (Luke Spill), and most significantly, Peter (Freddie Highmore).  He meets them in the park one day, and they become good friends and playmates.  Barrie uses his incredible imagination to entertain and enlighten the boys, all the while growing closer to their widowed mother, Sylvia (Kate Winslet).  Unfortunately, some of their romance stuff is pretty slow, and rather predictable, which weighs down the film and prevents it from getting a perfect rating.This film is a bit like ""Big Fish"", with scenes of ""reality"" intercut with beautiful fantasy.  It's also reminiscent of ""Shakespeare in Love"", with moments in Barrie's life that obviously inspire aspects of the ""Peter Pan"" story.Even though it is probably technically a ""romance"", ""Finding Neverland"" is an interesting tale of how a lasting work of theatrical and literary art is developed and created.  Writers definitely ""write what they know"".  This film gives us a glimpse at what the inside of a truly creative person's mind must look like:  images and feelings, wrapped together to form a seamless, wonderful tale.Johnny Depp is excellent as J. M. Barrie.  His English accent is impeccable, and a different dialect than we heard in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" (though he does slip briefly back into Jack Sparrow when he's playing ""pirates"" with the boys).Perhaps what says the most about Depp's skills as an actor is that his next role will be that of zany Willie Wonka in the upcoming remake of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", a abrupt departure from his sophisticated (but still good-humored) J. M. Barrie.",4,"Depp finds success again in ""Neverland""",1108771200,"02 19, 2005",2005,2901,"['Here', 'scary', 'revelation', 'Evan', 'Average', 'Joe', 'Reviewer', 'Hinton', 'actually', 'agreeing', 'snooty', 'movie', 'critic', 'community', 'one', 'serious', 'Oscar-worthy', 'pictures', 'Yes', 'usually', 'find', 'deep', 'emotional', 'dramatic', 'films', 'boring', 'dull', 'minor', 'bout', 'yawn-induction', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'interesting', 'touching', 'drama', 'starring', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'current', 'superstars', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'almost', 'entirely', 'true', 'story', 'how', 'English', 'playwright', 'James', 'Matthew', 'Barrie', 'was', 'inspired', 'write', 'most', 'famous', 'play', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'was', 'originally', 'scheduled', 'premiere', 'last', 'year', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'time', 'latest', 'movie', 'rendition', 'Barrie', 'famous', 'play', 'hit', 'theaters', 'Ultimately', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'did', ""n't"", 'pan', 'out', 'har', 'too', 'well', 'time', 'Columbia', 'Pictures', 'refused', 'allow', 'Miramax', 'use', 'portions', 'play', 'movies', 'were', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'held', 'year', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'premiered', 'larger', 'cities', 'months', 'ago', 'recently', 'gotten', 'lot', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'humble', 'theater', 'begun', 'showing', 'here.As', 'story', 'J.', 'M.', 'Barrie', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'was', 'inspired', 'create', 'story', 'children', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'Llewelyn', 'Davies', 'George', 'Nick', 'Roud', 'Jack', 'Joe', 'Prospero', 'Michael', 'Luke', 'Spill', 'most', 'significantly', 'Peter', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'park', 'one', 'day', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'playmates', 'Barrie', 'incredible', 'imagination', 'entertain', 'enlighten', 'boys', 'growing', 'closer', 'widowed', 'mother', 'Sylvia', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Unfortunately', 'romance', 'stuff', 'pretty', 'slow', 'rather', 'predictable', 'down', 'film', 'prevents', 'getting', 'perfect', 'rating.This', 'film', 'bit', 'Big', 'Fish', 'scenes', 'reality', 'intercut', 'beautiful', 'fantasy', 'also', 'reminiscent', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'moments', 'Barrie', 'life', 'obviously', 'inspire', 'aspects', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'story.Even', 'probably', 'technically', 'romance', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'interesting', 'tale', 'how', 'lasting', 'work', 'theatrical', 'literary', 'art', 'developed', 'created', 'Writers', 'definitely', 'write', 'what', 'know', 'film', 'glimpse', 'what', 'inside', 'truly', 'creative', 'person', 'mind', 'must', 'look', 'images', 'feelings', 'wrapped', 'together', 'form', 'seamless', 'wonderful', 'tale.Johnny', 'Depp', 'excellent', 'J.', 'M.', 'Barrie', 'English', 'accent', 'impeccable', 'different', 'dialect', 'heard', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'slip', 'briefly', 'back', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'when', 'playing', 'pirates', 'boys', '.Perhaps', 'what', 'most', 'Depp', 'skills', 'actor', 'next', 'role', 'will', 'be', 'zany', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'upcoming', 'remake', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'abrupt', 'departure', 'sophisticated', 'still', 'good-humored', 'J.', 'M.', 'Barrie']",Finding Neverland

I'm glad I didn't get too pumped up about it meanwhile, or I would have been  disappointed. I had thought that this movie would be something of a biography of James M. Barrie, the author of Peter Pan, but it hardly qualifies as such.We are not given much insight into Mr. Barrie's character or behavior, or that of anyone else featured in the film, for that matter. What we get are essentially one-dimensional stick figures. J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) meets four children and their widowed mother (Kate Winslet) in the park while walking his dog. Suddenly they all become inseparable, much to the chagrin of Barrie's wife (Radha Mitchell) and Winslet's character's mother (Julie Christie). For the most part, the adults (excepting perhaps the Christie character) are too busy being dignified to show emotion or reveal their motivation(s). Mr. Barrie maintains a certain stateliness even when playing with the children, often while wearing a three-piece suit.The result is a film which fails to hook the viewer, who is also unable to get emotionally involved.

879965,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0007CNXUK,Grady Harp,"[6, 7]","FINDING NEVERLAND is that rare work of art that transcends the medium of film and becomes a spirit-altering experience.  Strong accolades?  Gush?  Perhaps so, but squeeze time out of the clutter of life and the holidays to see this movie and be transported to a place that nurturingly reassures us that the cycle of life is indeed good.  Find Neverland!Marc Forster ('Monster Ball') has created a lovingly tender look at the playwright JM Barrie (Johnny Depp) in 1903 when, down on his luck with theater flops, unfulfilled by a marriage of Victorian standards to a beautiful but aloof and social climbing wife Mary (Radha Mitchell), and with writer's block, he encounters the Llewellyn Davies family - a widow Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her four boys, George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Prospero), Michael (Luke Spill) and Peter (Freddie Highmore) - playing blissfully in Kensington Gardens.  Barrie is captivated, draws the boys to him with his patient and infectious enthusiasm for play, and bonds with this family, gaining the obvious seeds for his highest achievement or creation, PETER PAN.How these seeds grow, despite the soft, yet supportive, growling of his producer Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman) and the not so soft interference of Sylvia's wealthy haughty mother Madame du Maurier (Julie Christie), form the storyline of this film.  The magic comes from the skill of the writers (Alan Knee and David Magee) and director, the cinematographer (never has Victorian London glowed with such elegant gaslight presence), and the musical score by Jan Kaczmarek.  Cameo roles are treated with tremendous respect: Eileen Essel as Mrs. Snow, Ian Hart as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Kelly MacDonald as the first Peter Pan, etc all are brief but fully realized and poignant.Given this support it is obvious that the talents of the lead performers will shine, and they glow they do with such understated performances that make the simple story of the sanctity of the inner child so cogent that there is not a dry eye in the house during the thankfully long credits.  Johnny Depp continues to prove that he is one of the finest actors on the screen today: his Barrie has a flawless Scottish accent and a manner of movement and facial expressions that make him a gentle hero.  Kate Winslet, never more beautiful, likewise embodies Sylvia with exactly the right amount of perk and pathos, and as her mother, Julie Christie is strikingly beautiful and unfailingly solid in a role less than loving.  The boys are artfully recreated, never absurdly over the top, always very close to the bridge that crosses the craggy canyon between childhood and adulthood.  Growing up has never been better portrayed -  by all of the characters!In a time when too often films that address magic and imagination rely on computer effects to create creatures that are comic book absurd, FINDING NEVERLAND relies on simply showing the stage mechanics of the play, suspending wires and all, even in the climax of the story when Barrie brings his successful play to the living room of the ill Sylvia in order to keep his promise to her to take her to Neverland.  No gimmicks here, just solid stagecraft very much in keeping with the inherent magic of Barrie's enduring play.  This is a brilliant cinematic accomplishment - a feast for the eyes, the ears, the brain, and the soul.  Please don't miss it!  Grady Harp, November 2004",5,"10 Stars!

And that really could be a more apt description of this movie. This script is a complete fabrication out of the minds of the script writers, with a lot of marketing thrown in by the Corporate sponsors to make sure this movie is a sellable to Middle America. As anyone who has read a biography of Barrie knows, his relationship with the Llewelyn Davies family was very complicated, and not entirely innocent. Not the least important defect of the movie script is that it's inaccurate about even the most basic of details about Barrie and his involvment with this family. For instance, Barrie first became involved with the Llewlyn Davies family when the father was still alive and living with the family. But the most grevious defect of the movie is portraying Barrie's interest in the children as entirely innocent. The original book ""Peter Pan"" was actually an adult fairy tale by a subliminated pedophile. The movie is no more a reflection of Barrie's relationship with these kids and their mother then Disney's cartoon version of ""Peter Pan"" bore a relationship to the original story. The little boys in their little outfits with their knee breeches are wholesome and cute, and Barry's relationship with the boy's mother is pure fatherly concern for the welfare of his boys. Yeah, we've heard that one before! Shades of Wacko Jacko Jackson, and his ranch, ""Neverland"", more exactly.

But his role is a composition of the best and most difficult type, the type of stunts you don't need a stuntman to do in your place. The film is a real gem for two main reasons. First of all because it is a love story in a time when love was some kind of forbidden goods in the aristocracy. And the love story is so pure, so beyond any doubt that he avoids melodrama when death decides to play his own game with that Johnny who invades the widowed mother's life a little bit too much. Dramatic but not tear-wringing. And the second reason of the beauty of that film is also the reason why it remains feeling intense without being heart rending or heart breaking. The whole film is centered on a bunch of boys and brothers and Peter is so young that we are amazed by his being so present, so good, so mature in his performance. He does not miss a word, a sentiment or an emotion and his so deep acting touches us a lot more than the obstinacy of Death to come and take away what he considers his owed property. And all the rest is nothing but the clothing and beefing up of that power. Johnny Depp becomes a real prodigy in this composition and he looks so serious that we forget the genial clown he is quite often in other films. Peter Pan is a legend and his author is like the Peter of Heavens, the guide and majordomo of our imagination who can introduce us to what real spiritual happiness can be. And we discover we are still able to dream because somewhere the film wakes up the child or even the baby who has never died completely in our life of needs and wants and remembers the cradle that a motherly hand was rocking in a regular and powerful rolling that has inspired our most intimate desires as soon as we were big enough to sleep flat on our stomach in an adult bed. Regular and religious rhythm of that rocking.

The highlight is certainly the last 20 minutes or so, with the opening night performance of Barrie's play and then the private staging of it at the Davies home.  Much of the rest of the elegantly staged and acted film feels exactly that way -- a collection of set pieces laid end to end for a couple hours.  Peter Pan is all about play, energy and imagination but even when playing Johnny Depp and the Davies boys seem more like they are working than having fun.  (What looks like the most fun, in fact, is the game the boys are playing when young Michael is found beneath Barrie's park bench.)  Depp is more burdened and tired than mischievous and flighty in his interpretation of Barrie -- and that may be exactly right, but again, it's not exactly fun.  In Barrie's increasingly loveless marriage, all this viewer's sympathies lie with his wife.  His neglect of her is shameless and selfish, as is his reaction when -- after being away from home night after night with the Davies -- he comes home to find that she once, once!, has chatted late into the night with a male visitor who came looking for Barrie.  And Kate Winslet has little to do but look, first, overwhelmed by four active boys and then consumptive -- which she does quite fetchingly.  My question is whether there has ever been a more ""she's a goner"" movie cough than the one Winslet produces as she and Depp are walking to watch a play her sons have staged.  Dustin Hoffman, on the other hand, has a wonderful time playing the role of Barrie's long-suffering producer.

It is truly a beautiful movie, probably one of Johnny Dep's best. The portrayal of Barrie's journey to develop Peter Pan makes for an interesting and thoroughly touching story, even if it does occasionally wander into melodrama. Fans of Kate Winslet will enjoy her wonderful performance as Carrie's muse and Hoffman's role, though small, is hilarious. The movie basically plays up on the relationship he develops with 4 boys who play sons of Kate Winslett. They become his inspiration for writing Peter Pan. Even having said that, it can't begin to discribe how moving and touching the entire movie plays out. Johnny Dep brings out the kid in all of us.

879984,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0007CNXUK,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[8, 11]","""Finding Neverland"" is a deeply moving, poetic film, based on the life of Scottish playwright and novelist James Matthew Barrie, and adapted from Allan Knee's play ""The Man Who Was Peter Pan."" It is a fictional account of how Barrie came to write ""Peter Pan,"" which has long been a beloved children's classic symbolizing everlasting youth.Johnny Depp gives an unusually understated, sensitive performance as J. M. Barrie, who is facing a crisis in life. His latest play is not receiving accolades, and his marriage has grown cold and sterile. He meets Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, (Kate Winslet), a widowed mother of four sons, and immediately hits it off with her boys - played by Joe Prospero, Nicholas Roud, Luke Spill, and the extremely gifted Freddie Highmore as Peter. Although he is friendly with Sylvia, it is with the children that he is able to take-off on glorious flights of imagination. And the five of them soar. Their back-yard games transform into fantasy imagery. They're flying!! The results are remarkable scenes played out as adventures, veritable fetes of daring. He and the boys act as pirates sailing the Spanish Main, cowboys and ""red Indians"" riding the plains of the old West.In reality, however, this is Edwardian England, not the Wild West, and Barrie's friend Arthur Conan Doyle, (Ian Hart), warns him of vicious gossip about his ""unseemly"" interest in the family. Barrie responds with disgust. As he becomes increasingly involved with the boys, tension escalates between him and his upper-class wife, Mary, (Radha Mitchell). Sylvia's mother, Emma (Julie Christie), also lifts a questioning brow, wondering why on earth a grown man would spend so much time with children, and someone else's to boot!Barrie's deep feelings for Sylvia and her boys are genuine. A decent man, he never had kids of his own, nor did he have much of a childhood. Complex and creative, emotionally immature with a brilliant mind, he carves out a realm for himself with the Davies family, his own Neverland of sorts. He lavishes them with affection, gifts, and tons of energy as he enacts, with them all, his inspired games. His poignant longing for the childhood he missed is evident. For me, Barrie epitomizes the ""lost boy."" The children, in turn, love him back and gift him with the inspiration for his haunting tale of Peter Pan, the youth who refuses to grow up. In David Magee's screenplay, Sylvia is the female figure in Barrie's fantasies - like a Wendy - more maternal than wifely.Sorrow and loss lie just over the horizon from this world of fantasy and delight, but I will keep them at bay here. Let it suffice to say that some dark themes are explored. Director Marc Forster has delivered a fine period piece, with amazing sets and costume design. The acting is superb. Johnny Depp imbues the film with a sense of wonder. Ultimately, ""Finding Neverland"" is about holding on to the all the magical aspects of childhood and keeping the imagination alive.

879991,A1PNNR3B9H8GTC,B0007CNXUK,Jeremy Berman,"[4, 6]","The role of unpredictable writer J.M. Barrie is one that Johnny Depp was born to play. Only an actor who blends eccentricity and sensitivity as seamlessly as Depp could ever think of inhabiting an artist who created a literary world of pirates, fairies and pixie dust to combat the social pressures and personal tragedies that torment humanity. As I watched Depp morph into the 19th century British aristocrat that crafted the unforgettable adventures of Peter Pan, I was stunned to find that many of the nuances and emotions that had characterized his most memorable performances were coalescing before my eyes: I saw the abiding sweetness of Edward Scissorhands mingling with the unbridled optimism and energy of Ed Wood and the sheer lust for life that inhabited Captain Jack Sparrow. The result is a performance that is as dynamic, affecting and disarmingly enjoyable as any I've seen this year, and one that defines the persona and uniqueness of Johnny Depp just as clearly as the part of Rhett Butler revealed all the priorities and charm of Clark Gable. Even without such a brilliant star turn, Finding Neverland would still be an extremely pleasant and moving parable about the use of creativity and imagination to confront personal demons, but Depp elevates the film into the realm of magic.When the movie commences, Barrie's life is in dismal condition. His latest play is an unqualified disaster, his producer Charles Frohman (a very amusing Dustin Hoffman) has little faith in his future prospects as a writer, and he is trapped in a confining marriage to a humorless social climber (Radha Mitchell). Things take a turn for the better when he encounters the Davies family, a harried brood that consists of four boys and widowed mother Sylvia (Kate Winslet). Their lives have been dispirited since the death of the patriarch, and they will come to know more suffering when Sylvia begins showing the symptoms of consumption. Barrie revives the passion and purpose in his own life by teaching the Davies boys to mitigate their grief through whimsy and imagination, and the innocence and playfulness of the children ultimately inspires the timeless story of Peter Pan.In several marvelously inventive and well-constructed sequences, director Marc Forster cuts between the elaborate fantasy worlds imagined by Barrie and the children and the prosaic backyard circumstances they are escaping. Depp transforms himself into pirate captains, Indian chiefs and circus performers with incredible style and panache, and his sheer giddiness is always infectious among the audience. Such outlandishness is always thrilling to watch, but Depp is equally effective in quieter and more reflective moments. He conveys an appropriate mix of frustration and pity in his conversations with his chilly wife, and the scene in which he confides to Sylvia the tragic family history that led him to pursue a career as an imagineer is a masterpiece of restrained, heartfelt acting.Forster is to be congratulated for finding such brilliant child actors to play off of Depp's franticness and compassion. Freddie Highmore is unforgettable in the role of Peter, the pragmatic middle child who resists Barrie's games and adventures because they blind him to the important and tragic events occurring in his life. Highmore traces Peter's emotional journey with maturity and depth, best epitomized by his changing attitudes toward creative writing. Equally excellent is Nick Roud as eldest son George, who requires Barrie's help to balance the burgeoning responsibilities and maturity that come with adolescence and his own desire for fantasy and frivolity. And Luke Spill (playing the role of youngest child Michael Davies) is quite simply the most adorable moppet to grace the screen since Drew Barrymore in E.T. I defy any audience member not to lose their heart to him within thirty seconds of his arrival on screen.Finding Neverland may focus most of its attention on the male bonding between Barrie and the Davies boys, but the women do not get lost in the shuffle. Although Mrs. Davies seems to exist initially as a romantic alternative to Mrs. Barrie, Sylvia movingly emerges as the greatest convert to Barrie's glorious world of make-believe. As her health deteriorates, she relies on magic and fantasy to bring her hope and hold her family together. Winslet plays the role with an astonishing mix of resoluteness and vulnerability, and she will probably be joining Depp as one of this year's most prominent Oscar contenders. Veteran actress Julie Christie also deserves a great deal of credit for humanizing the essentially villainous character of Mrs. Du Maurier, Sylvia's rigid mother. Her eyes and body language always capture the essence of a woman who wishes to protect her daughter at any cost, even when her dialogue characterizes her as a one-note harpy bent on driving Barrie's imaginative nonsense from the family household.Despite reports from the Barrie estate that Finding Neverland distorts many of the events in the writer's life, the film is always true to his spirited personality and literary priorities. Barrie was an illusionist who would have welcomed any creative touches that might have rendered his life story more exciting, uproarious or touching, if only to inspire and enchant the audience. He would have adored this thought-provoking gem of a movie and treasured Depp's bravura performance, just as audiences will today.",5,Finding Enchantment,1099872000,"11 8, 2004",2004,5436,"['role',

879995,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0007CNXUK,Joe Sherry,"[202, 228]","A film by Marc ForsterJ.M Barrie (Johnny Depp) is something of a failed playwright.  His latest play has just flopped on opening night.  The audience was bored and left the theatre saying how dreadful it was.  His relationship with his wife, Mary (Radha Mitchell) is chilly and loveless.  But James Barrie still has an incredibly fertile imagination, turning the mundane into something more spectacular and wondrous, if only in his mind.  While writing in a park James encounters the Davies family with one of the boys lying under the bench Barrie is sitting on.  This boy is pretending to have been imprisoned by the king, George (Nick Roud), who is really just his older brother.  Barrie, unlike what most adults would do, plays right along with the scene and tries to bargain young Michael (Luke Spill) out of jail.  Immediately Barrie seems to form a friendship with the family, performing a little play with his dog for the family, which includes the mother Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her other two sons Peter (Freddie Highmore) and Jack (Joe Prospero).  Barrie spends more and more time with the Davies, befriending Sylvia and playing make believe with the children.  From this relationship we see instances of Barrie's imagination taking hold and the creation of aspects of ""Peter Pan"".Three of the boys join in and play every game with James Barrie, but young Peter does not.  Still grieving and resentful at the death of his father, Peter will not play.  In talking with James, however, Peter starts to come out of his shell.  It is clear that this friendship, which is entirely innocent of anything romantic (in the case of Sylvia) or otherwise is of great comfort both to the Davies family as well as to James Barrie.  There is conflict, of course.  Sylvia's mother, Mrs Emma Du Maurier (Julie Christie) disapproves because of Barrie's behavior but also because she feels that the friendship will only cause a scandal and ruin any chance of Sylvia's being able to remarry into ""Society"".  Barrie, of course, is married.  This is the other major conflict.  Mary is resentful of the time Barrie spends away from her, but it is also clear that their relationship is not working even before he met Sylvia and her family.  They were already sleeping in separate bedrooms (though that may have been a cultural thing, I am not sure).While all of this is happening, the producer of Barrie's plays, Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman) is trying to get Barrie's new play financed and is very worried when he sees what it is.  It is a play about fairies and children with an alligator and a grown man who must dress up in a dog costume.  Since these plays are shown to the ""High Society"", it is a play destined to flop.  Coming from the twenty first century, we also know it is destined to become a classic in ""Peter Pan"".Rated PG, ""Finding Neverland"" is a wonderful family film.  In fact, that is the exact word that came to mind as I walked out of the theatre: Wonderful.  There is truly a sense of wonder about J.M. Barrie and his imagination which created Neverland.  His friendship with the Davies comes off as genuine and heartfelt and entirely natural.  Johnny Depp's performance carries the movie, though Winslet and the four children are also to be commended for how well ""Finding Neverland"" has turned out.  Depp is much more restrained here than in most of his other movie, but he still is able to shine through with a quirkly personality that feels appropriate to Barrie.  ""Finding Neverland"" is a very imaginative movie, beautifully shot, with enough scenes of Barrie's imagination to override what could have otherwise been a drab London.

I must respectfully disagree with that. Yes, there were a few facts that were fudged - but that's all, just a few. The core of both stories is the same: how an adult came to find a muse within children, and to use his inspiration to write a genre breaking play that gave the world one of the most endearing characters in all of fiction.Unlike many who have posted reviews, I have never been overly fond of Johnny Depp. However, that was not the case in this film. I've seen countless films of his, and enjoyed them on one level or another, but his personal involvement never affected me in a positive way. The perfect example for this is Chocolat, easily one of my favorite films, but I could have taken or left Johnny Depp. Finding Neverland has changed my opinion of Mr. Depp entirely, and I now count myself one of his fans. His performance was so understated, so sublime, so perfect that he made an admirer out of me. It takes an amazing performance to do such a thing, and this was an amazing performance.Kate Winslet was Kate Winslet: without fault, capable of evoking emotion with a simple cough. The moment she appeared on the screen seemed almost to be the beginning of the film. Rather - the moment her character and her character's children appeared on film was when it really beganWinslet and Depp had terrific chemistry on screen - in fact, they may have had too much. They looked so good when they were together, that it seemed as if they should have been husband and wife. I kept expecting them to get together, but since one of the fudged facts is that Winslet's character's husband was still alive during all of this, that was impossible.The film did a wonderful job showing something that would have been highly frowned upon in today's society. A grown man, spending all of his time with children? There may have been a restraining order placed upon him with today's sensibilities.

M. Barrie that inspired his masterwork, 'Peter Pan.' But it goes beyond the mere workings of creativity. It actually becomes a celebration of imagination itself and the day-to-day hope and comfort that can be fashioned by it.Johnny Depp actually gets out of the way of the character and Kate Winslet does her usual excellent period piece work. Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman have important parts (Even if a bit distracting. I mean just how many women had obvious facelifts in the early 1900s?). But the most impressive actor by far in this picture is then-nine-year-old Freddie Highmore as Winslet's son, Peter. He brings immediacy and honesty to a role that the movie hinges upon and will probably leave the most lasting impression on viewers.Though the film has its flaws and a few ""misunderstood artist"" cliches, its vision eventually rises effortlessly above them, much like the Darling children when they also think of a wonderful thought.The penultimate scene is beyond description. On paper it would sound awfully simple.

880011,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B0007CNXUK,Kaya Savas,"[0, 0]","MOVIE: The story of the real Peter Pan, James Mathew Barrie.  The movie opens with Barrie impatiently waiting for reaction on his latest play, he is off to the side watching people's reactions.  At the end it  turns out to be a failure, and his producer who is played by Dustin Hoffman is beginning to become impatient with him.  As Barrie spends one of his afternoons at the park he meets a widowed mother and her four sons. He becomes inspired by the children's soaring minds and imagination and befriends them. However one of the boys, Peter, looks at everything at a literal level.  He still is hanging over the fact that his father died, and playing pretend doesn't seem to cover up reality. The audience sees that Barrie himself is still a child as he teaches the boys to open their minds through various adventures. He ends up spending day after day with the family and becomes close to the mother, played by Kate Winslet.  The grandmother of the family does not approve of Barrie spending all this time with them, and neither does Barrie's wife or the rest of the city.  Sexuality is played around as one of the themes.  Most of the folk feel that  spending time with these children is showing sexual intrest. His wife feels that he is doing this just for Mrs. Davies (Winslet). The audience sees this separation between Barrie and his wife, and she comes across more as his mother than his companion.  They even sleep in seperate rooms.  That is just a small theme addressed, but the major idea of the film is holding on to what you cherish.  Barrie, while although very smart, grows up with these children in a sense.  He is placed into a new role, and as he meets the children he could fit as their sibling, but as time progresses he fits a more fatherly role to them.  The ending will tug at your heart, and while it is tragic it sends the message that no matter what life delivers you, everything you hold dear will stay in Neverland.  All you have to do is close your eyes and you can revisit everything you cherish at anytime.ACTING/DIRECTING: This year's Best Actor category is tough, and Johnny Depp has a very good chance of taking it.  This is truly the best work he has ever done.  His portrayal of Barrie is poignant and heartfelt.  Marc Foster's visual style of Barrie's imagination is truly vivid and wonderful.  The audience takes a step through the doorway into the mind of a fascinating writer.  The cinematography was also some of the most captivating I've seen in a while.BOTTOM LINE: Touching, funny, tragic, and heartfelt.  Finding Neverland is an amazing story of finding one's self and finding the things that make us happy and complete.  While sometimes in our lives we may lose the things that complete us, mentally we will always be attached, never letting them escape our thoughts.  Take the opportunity to see Finding Neverland in theaters before the big night.

880012,A35CLKCUCRITU1,B0007CNXUK,K. Cooley,"[0, 0]","Imagine a wonderful film with no violence, no obscenities, and no torrid love scene...FINDING NEVERLAND proves that, yes, it still can be done successfully in this day and age and stand strongly against other films.Johnny Depp play the title role as the author of Peter Pan, struggling from writer's block after his last play flops.  Kate Winslet is wonderful as Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies, the widowed mother of 4 boys and head of the family who inspire Barrie to write Peter Pan.  Julie Christie is great as the grandmother you love to hate--fearful for her daughter's reputation, but also ""protecting what she has"" as she puts it during a strong talk with Barrie.The 4 young men who play the Davies brothers are especially impressive.  They look and act like brothers and hardly seem to be acting at all because they are so natural.  Note that all 4 of the boys lended their names to the story:  John (Jack) and Michael are Wendy's younger brothers, George is the father (and the oldest son), and of course Peter is the boy who refuses to grow up.  Legend has it that Barrie created the name Wendy and it was first heard in Peter Pan.Of course the stand-out young man is Freddie Highmore, who plays the young Peter from whom Barrie borrows the name of his title character.  I think we'll see great things from him in the future.  He'll be playing Charlie Bucket in Tim Burton's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.  Johnny Depp will be Willy Wonka.  These are great roles for Johnny, who seems to be defying aging himself.  Who knows how FINDING NEVERLAND would've turned out if Johnny Depp hadn't been cast as J.M. Barrie?  Fortunately, we'll never know.Dustin Hoffman does a superb turn as Charles Frohman, Barrie's producer.  Of course, we all know that Dustin Hoffman can do anything onscreen, but it is fun to see him linked to Peter Pan once more after his hilarious turn as Captain Hook in HOOK, with Robin Williams.If differently cast, with different editing, this could've been a very boring movie.

I'm Kind Of A ...","[0, 0]",When I saw the previews for Finding Neverland I was very sure it was just a new addition to the many remakes of Peter Pan but I made the mistake of judging it. Of course like a lot of people my attention was directed to the film more because of Johnny Depp but it wasn't enough for me to hit the theatre. You soon find out that Johnny is enough and he hit's his amazing character right on point. The film may seem a little slow or boring to some but the story is so interesting that you can't turn it off.In the previews you don't really don't get that the film is about the author of Peter Pan and how he created the play and not Pan itself and this becomes a rope that pulls you in. When you see how beautiful the mind of J.M. Barrie you want nothing more then to see how Pans story begins. To be honest this film is almost better than watching any Peter Pan film because it tells the story of the creator and the children that are Peter Pan and his friends but in reality they are real people.,5,The Story I Never Knew,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,996,"['When', 'saw', 'previews', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'was', 'very', 'sure', 'was', 'just', 'new', 'addition', 'many', 'remakes', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'made', 'mistake', 'judging', 'course', 'lot', 'people', 'attention', 'was', 'directed', 'film', 'more', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'hit', 'theatre', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'Johnny', 'enough', 'hit', 'amazing', 'character', 'right', 'point', 'film', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'slow', 'boring', 'story', 'so', 'interesting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off.In', 'previews', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'film', 'author', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'how', 'created', 'play', 'not', 'Pan', 'rope', 'When', 'see', 'how', 'beautiful', 'mind', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'want', 'nothing', 'more', 'then', 'see', 'how', 'Pans', 'story', 'be', 'honest', 'film', 'almost', 'better', 'watching', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'film', 'story', 'creator', 'children', 'are', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'friends', 'reality', 'are', 'real', 'people']",Finding Neverland
880014,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B0007CNXUK,Kenji Fujishima,"[7, 13]","Marc Forster's FINDING NEVERLAND isn't a bad movie, I suppose. In its depiction of playwright J.M. Barrie's creation of the classic PETER PAN, it has its occasional moments of real wide-eyed wonder (mostly during re-enactments of moments in the actual play), and it has generally fine performances from its cast---not even the prestige-pic atmosphere of this movie can keep the wide-ranging actor Johnny Depp down. And, of course, the movie looks sumptuous and handsome (which counts for something in my book).But FINDING NEVERLAND is yet another example of the kind of sentimental, non-threatening tripe that Hollywood has a tendency to produce and foist upon the masses during Oscar season. This particular Oscar-bait picture has as its mantra ""Just believe,"" but the movie rarely ever elicits the same sense of innocent wonder that this film's Barrie clearly believes in. (Its brief ""fantasy"" sequences---which includes Barrie dancing with a dog, or Barrie playing a pirate with a widower's kids---are too cheesily done to make us believe in anything.) Nor does it have much of a sharp edge to its potentially disturbing depiction of a writer's sudden fixation on the widower's kids; his attraction to the innocence of these kids---at least, in most of the kids; one of them, played by Freddie Highmore, still carries the pain and anger of loss with him---is depicted (and romanticized) by Forster and screenwriter David Magee as mostly pure and rather beautiful. (Yea right; so is Michael Jackson's, too?) By smoothing away almost all of the rough edges, by manipulating events to fit its banal message, by toning down Johnny Depp's usual actorly exuberance, Marc Forster comes up with a film that, for all its impressive production values, is never very intellectually stimulating. It's insufferably pleasant rather than challenging. Is it deeply moving? For me, not really; when Forster finally unveils his visual depiction of Neverland towards the end, it is mawkish rather than transporting; so is its final scene, in which Barrie tells disillusioned young Peter Davies to ""just believe"" that his relatives still live on.Look, it's a nice idea, to be able to hold on to your child-like innocence and all that. But, just because you become an adult, that doesn't mean you have to lose your imagination or sense of child-like wonder. (That's one of the things movies can do best---but not this movie.) But it's hardly a good idea either to be as child-like as this film's Barrie is; in this difficult world, you'd never survive if your only purpose in life was to remain an innocent child throughout, the way Barrie tries to be. Growing up is something everybody has to do; it's something FINDING NEVERLAND apparently doesn't believe in. It's better to remain a naive kid rather than live in the real world. And of course this potentially dangerous philosophy gets applause from gullible viewers who find the movie ""enchanting"": it's a fantasy that appeals to them, which is precisely why I think the film is intellectually empty. Sorry if that sounds terribly cynical, but that personal reaction to the film's message is the only way I can explain why there was only one scene in the movie that genuinely moved me: a scene in which an angry Peter Davies shouts out to Barrie, ""I will not be lied to."" It's the only scene with any real dramatic weight to it, because it is the closest the movie comes to challenging its own sentimental, simple-minded ""just believe"" philosophy. Peter has glimpsed the cold, hard reality of death, and is trying to deal with it in his own way; this film's Barrie, instead, would probably try to tell himself that no one ever really dies, as long as his/her memory is kept alive. Again, a comforting notion; but it can be plain delusional to deny the harsh reality of death.FINDING NEVERLAND is well-made enough that it's worth the 3 stars I'm granting it here. The movie probably makes worthy family entertainment; there's nothing all that offensive for parents to get too worried about. But if you're expecting something truly insightful or deeply moving from this trite Hollywood prestige pic, you might be disappointed.

Too many people will be watching it knowing that facts are fudged to make better cinema.  And that's what has happened here.On the other hand you have Johnny Depp at the top of his form, acting with a really very well done Northern accent that was probably tweaked very slightly in post-production.  I thought that the picture was a little muddled up--was it supposed to show that Barrie was so imaginative that he saved the lives of the Llewellyn Davies boys, or was it the other way around?  And if it was both, then why was it so sad?  Anyone watching the movie would assume that Mary, Mrs. Barrie, the character played by Radha Mitchell, was a social climber in 1904 and that she aspired to get to know Emma Du Maurier (the Julie Christie part) because of Christie's superior social status.  That's just all wrong and the screenwriters must have known this.  There was not this enormous social distance between the two families, both were well-known in theatrical circles but as anyone knows, that was a very louche occupation a hundred years ago, no guarantee of respectability.After the film was over, I realized I had been so captivated by the superior performances of Depp, Christie, Winslet and little Freddie Highmore that I didn't even care.  Was Barrie supposed to have been in love with Sylvia?  I didn't get that in the movie, until quite late, when little Peter lashes out at Barrie saying something like, ""My mother never cared for you the way she cared for my father!""  Johnny Depp didn't even look that upset, just concerned that his boys not suffer too much from her absence.I wish they would make a sequel that would show the horrible things that happened to the four boys in the rough years that were to follow the Edwardian age.  Was it worth it?  Who's to say!  Another bonus is the remarkable acting of Kelly Macdonald (GOSFORD PARK) who plays ""Peter Pan"" on stage at the theater.

880018,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0007CNXUK,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[4, 7]","Imagination, the source of creativity and essential for hope, provides an opportunity to dream of endless possibilities in life, as it is also a necessary tool for writers and storytellers.  The storyteller needs an imagination when creating new stories, which can help people see possibilities in dire situations when everything seems to be bad.  Children often use their imagination for play and games while adults frequently forget this marvelous tool for success as they drift into a life of responsibility and work.  The Scottish playwright and journalist Sir James Matthew Barrie (Johnny Depp) must have kept his inner child close to him as he wrote masterpieces such as Peter Pan that display his boundless imagination about a boy that did not wanted to grow up.Finding Neverland is loosely based on events that took place in J.M. Barrie's life commencing in the year of 1903 after his latest play turned out to be an expensive fiasco.  In disappointment Barrie begins to search within himself and his own imagination where he could discover new and better material for a play.  Frequent walks in the London parks lead him to bump into widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four children -- Peter, Jack, George, and Michael.  The children trigger his imagination as he begins to play pretend with the children which brings him dancing bears, cowboys, Indians, pirates, and crocodiles.  He brings his fantasy land to the children, a land he calls Neverland, to which he escapes in order to get away from the daily hassles and the responsibilities of being an adult.One of the children, Peter (Freddie Highmore), shows no interest in imagination or pretending, as he frequently spoils moments by pointing out reality.  Barrie brings it on his own shoulders to help Peter discover the possibilities of imagination, but it turns out to be a tougher task than what he first thought.  Nonetheless, Barrie remains persistent in helping Peter see the possibilities of pretending as they play in the backyard of their house.  It seems as if Peter is holding on to what is real, as he still suffers from the loss of his father.Barrie's close relationship with Mrs. Davies brings people to suspect that he has ulterior motives.  It also begins to affect his relationship with his wife who suspects that he sees the Davies in order to meet with Sylvia.  Others have darker and much more ominous imaginations, as they seem to believe that he has developed a fondness for the children beyond care giving.  Despite the allegations Barrie continues to do what he thinks is right, but it seems to bring further heartache and pain to the family as people talk behind their back.Caught between Neverland and the reality of adulthood Barrie has to learn how to balance both sides while it might hurt people involved in his life.  His wife complains that she never see him since he is always working by staring at a wall dreaming himself away in order to write, or that he spends too much time with the Davies.  The Davies have their own problems into which Barrie has arrived by generating a positive fantasy world where pain does not exist; however, reality is much grimmer.  Barrie is caught between a fantasy world where he always has answers and reality where he seldom has answers, as the possibilities are not as frequent as in Neverland.Finding Neverland is a poignant story of the power of imagination that is wonderfully directed by Marc Forster who also directed Monster's Ball (2001).  Performances by the cast are dazzling with brilliant actors such as Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Julie Christie, and Dustin Hoffman among others.  Depp's performance as J.M. Barrie is outstanding, which displays a very complex character.  The mise-en-scene and cinematography elevate the visuals, which are enhanced by a great script that leaves the audience with a truly touching and thoughtful cinematic experience.",5,The Power of Imagination - A Source of Hope & Dreams...,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,3913,"['Imagination', 'source', 'creativity', 'essential', 'hope', 'opportunity', 'dream', 'endless', 'possibilities', 'life', 'also', 'necessary', 'tool', 'writers', 'storytellers', 'storyteller', 'imagination', 'when', 'creating', 'new', 'stories', 'can', 'help', 'people', 'see', 'possibilities', 'dire', 'situations', 'when', 'everything', 'be', 'bad', 'Children', 'often', 'use', 'imagination', 'play', 'games', 'adults', 'frequently', 'forget', 'marvelous', 'tool', 'success', 'drift', 'life', 'responsibility', 'work', 'Scottish', 'playwright', 'journalist', 'Sir', 'James', 'Matthew', 'Barrie', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'must', 'have', 'kept', 'inner', 'child', 'close', 'wrote', 'masterpieces', 'such', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'display', 'boundless', 'imagination', 'boy', 'did', 'not', 'wanted', 'grow', 'up.Finding', 'Neverland', 'loosely', 'based', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'life', 'commencing', 'year', '1903', 'latest', 'play', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'expensive', 'fiasco', 'disappointment', 'Barrie', 'search', 'own', 'imagination', 'where', 'could', 'discover', 'new', 'better', 'material', 'play', 'Frequent', 'walks', 'London', 'parks', 'lead', 'bump', 'widow', 'Sylvia', 'Llewelyn', 'Davies', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'four', 'children', 'Peter', 'Jack', 'George', 'Michael', 'children', 'trigger', 'imagination', 'play', 'pretend', 'children', 'dancing', 'bears', 'cowboys', 'Indians', 'pirates', 'crocodiles', 'fantasy', 'land', 'children', 'land', 'Neverland', 'order', 'get', 'away', 'daily', 'hassles', 'responsibilities', 'being', 'adult.One', 'children', 'Peter', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'interest', 'imagination', 'pretending', 'frequently', 'moments', 'pointing', 'out', 'reality', 'Barrie', 'own', 'shoulders', 'help', 'Peter', 'discover', 'possibilities', 'imagination', 'out', 'be', 'tougher', 'task', 'what', 'first', 'thought', 'Nonetheless', 'Barrie', 'persistent', 'helping', 'Peter', 'see', 'possibilities', 'pretending', 'play', 'backyard', 'house', 'Peter', 'holding', 'what', 'real', 'still', 'loss', 'father.Barrie', 'close', 'relationship', 'Mrs.', 'Davies', 'people', 'suspect', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'also', 'affect', 'relationship', 'wife', 'who', 'Davies', 'order', 'meet', 'Sylvia', 'Others', 'have', 'darker', 'much', 'more', 'ominous', 'imaginations', 'seem', 'believe', 'developed', 'fondness', 'children', 'care', 'giving', 'allegations', 'Barrie', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'bring', 'further', 'heartache', 'pain', 'family', 'people', 'talk', 'back.Caught', 'Neverland', 'reality', 'adulthood', 'Barrie', 'learn', 'how', 'balance', 'sides', 'might', 'hurt', 'people', 'involved', 'life', 'wife', 'never', 'see', 'always', 'working', 'staring', 'wall', 'dreaming', 'away', 'order', 'write', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'Davies', 'Davies', 'have', 'own', 'problems', 'Barrie', 'arrived', 'generating', 'positive', 'fantasy', 'world', 'where', 'pain', 'not', 'exist', 'however', 'reality', 'much', 'grimmer', 'Barrie', 'caught', 'fantasy', 'world', 'where', 'always', 'answers', 'reality', 'where', 'seldom', 'answers', 'possibilities', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'frequent', 'Neverland.Finding', 'Neverland', 'poignant', 'story', 'power', 'imagination', 'wonderfully', 'directed', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Monster', 'Ball', '2001', 'Performances', 'cast', 'are', 'dazzling', 'brilliant', 'actors', 'such', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'others', 'Depp', 'performance', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'outstanding', 'very', 'complex', 'character', 'mise-en-scene', 'cinematography', 'elevate', 'visuals', 'are', 'enhanced', 'great', 'script', 'audience', 'truly', 'touching', 'thoughtful', 'cinematic', 'experience']",Finding Neverland

It is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life and it a movie that kids might like watching with their parents as well.All about the creative process and based on real life events ""Finding Neverland"" will stay close to your heart right after you see the words ""The End.""  The movie begins just after J.M. Barrie's play flops and now he must find the difficult task of writing a hit. Then, by chance he comes across the recently widowed Winslet and her four young boys whom Barrie enjoys playing around with. He quickly forms a strong friendship with the boys and plays with them often going into worlds of imagination where their pirates, bear tamers, or cowboys. As Barrie's friendship grows for the family and particularly the youngesters Barrie becomes inspired to write what will be his greatest hit ""Peter Pan."" As the story progresses Barrie's friendship is tested with rumours of affairs, and dishonorable acts he may have towards the boys. And in many ways you can see how the Davies family has saved Barrie's imagination as he puts up with a sedated and less than loving wife. When Winslet starts to become ill with a serious cough Barrie knows he must care for the boys and their mother spending even more time with them and becoming even more inspired. When ""Peter Pan"" becomes a hit that is when, Barrie decides to tell a dying Winslet about Neverland.It was wonderful to watch and find out who inspired which character in Peter Pan. You can see it in the film who inspired what and what events happened in Barrie's dealing with the children that ended up in the play. After watching this movie Peter Pan had a whole new meaning to me and I found myself feeling chased by the ticking crocodile(Time's chasing after all of us). At the end I also found myself wondering what become of each of the boys who J.M Barrie was partial guardian too.This movie is nothing sort of genius. Who could have imagined a movie written about the creative process will come out so wonderful and rich? The young boys do a wonderful job acting particularly Peter. Johnny Depp delievers a performance that should have one him an Oscar and Winslet also gives one of her best performances. I felt a real connection between the two of them on screen and I wonder if Barrie was in love with her I remember he told Peter ""I loved your mother very much."" Johnny Depp seemed to be just as sweet and lovable as Colin Firth in the Bridget Jone's Movies as J.M.

Forget the usual spate of tired, formulaic ""holiday"" pictures (the dreadful ""Christmas with the Kranks,"" for example). Far more appropriate for the season is this sweet fact-based tale of playwright James Barrie (Johnny Depp) and his relationship with an attractive widow, Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies (Kate Winslet), and her sons--a friendship that inspired his classic play ""Peter Pan."" Foremost among the film's many virtues are the easy and unself-conscious way it slips between fantasy and reality, and its refusal to divide the players into facile heroes and villains. Barrie, played to perfection by Depp, is an enchanting figure to the Llewelyn-Davies boys, but also an impractical dreamer and negligent husband. Nor is all sweetness and light among the family he befriends: Peter (Freddie Highmore), the most sensitive of the boys, and Sylvia's mother Emma (Julie Christie, whose screen appearances these days are infrequent, but always welcome) in particular are wary, at times hostile. The gossip and disapproval that the playwright's unusual relationship with the family aroused are acknowledged as well. The vividness of the characters is due in equal parts to the literate, thoughtful screenplay and the almost uniformly superb quality of the acting.

I don't know why, but his portrayal in that movie cracked me up. He picks his movies carefully, and in the past, he just seemed strange. Kind of like an actor-version of Tim Burton. Now I am beginning to see that he is evolving as an actor, and as he evolves, he becomes better and better.As someone who existed on myths and fairytales when growing up, because the reality of life being a deaf child in a hearing school (and so constantly tortured...), I was not enamored of Peter Pan as done by Disney. It was insipid stuff, especially for a child with high reading skills at an early age. I much prefered even the musical with Mary Martin, and that thing was quite old by the time I started seeing it regularly on television.As I grew older, I read a lot more especially in college about Barry. He was not a successful man. He was lonely, and estranged from everyone. Who knows what type of psychological trauma he experienced. But I also read about him and the 'Lost Boys,' and there is no comparison between this man and his relationship with this family and a certain more modern person who will remain unnamed here. Barry learned to care for not just the boys, but this family (the father did not appreciate his presence in the family like the mother did not)...To an extent Barry was right. None of us want to grow up, because growing up means a lot of hurting...Barry was trying to explain that from the view of a child. I would rather have stayed home with my family who cared about me than going out into the real world, in which deafness is considered a 'horrific' difference. The feelings evoked by my favorite fairytales, whether in book format or movie format, were very much raised in this movie.the acting is beautiful, by all concerned. Even my husband was solemn at the end of the movie and admitted it was sweetly done. Depp continues to delight and surprise me, though I am aprehensive about his next foray with Burton into Willy Wonka, but I'll hold off judging him again, until I see his work.this is a beautiful movie...Karen Sadler",5,One of the most equisitely emotional movies...,1114732800,"04 29, 2005",2005,2118,"['never', 'liked', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'much', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'portrayal', 'movie', 'cracked', 'up', 'movies', 'carefully', 'past', 'just', 'seemed', 'strange', 'Kind', 'actor-version', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Now', 'am', 'beginning', 'see', 'evolving', 'actor', 'better', 'better.As', 'someone', 'who', 'existed', 'myths', 'fairytales', 'when', 'growing', 'up', 'reality', 'life', 'being', 'deaf', 'child', 'hearing', 'school', 'so', 'constantly', 'tortured', 'was', 'not', 'enamored', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'done', 'Disney', 'was', 'insipid', 'stuff', 'especially', 'child', 'high', 'reading', 'skills', 'early', 'age', 'much', 'prefered', 'even', 'musical', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'thing', 'was', 'quite', 'old', 'time', 'started', 'seeing', 'regularly', 'television.As', 'grew', 'older', 'read', 'lot', 'more', 'especially', 'college', 'Barry', 'was', 'not', 'successful', 'man', 'was', 'lonely', 'estranged', 'everyone', 'Who', 'what', 'type', 'psychological', 'trauma', 'experienced', 'also', 'read', ""'Lost"", 'Boys', 'comparison', 'man', 'relationship', 'family', 'certain', 'more', 'modern', 'person', 'who', 'will', 'remain', 'unnamed', 'here', 'Barry', 'learned', 'care', 'not', 'just', 'boys', 'family', 'father', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'presence', 'family', 'mother', 'did', 'not', 'extent', 'Barry', 'was', 'right', 'None', 'want', 'grow', 'up', 'growing', 'up', 'lot', 'hurting', 'Barry', 'was', 'trying', 'explain', 'view', 'child', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'stayed', 'home', 'family', 'who', 'cared', 'going', 'out', 'real', 'world', 'deafness', 'considered', ""'horrific"", 'difference', 'feelings', 'evoked', 'favorite', 'fairytales', 'book', 'format', 'movie', 'format', 'were', 'very', 'much', 'raised', 'movie.the', 'acting', 'beautiful', 'concerned', 'Even', 'husband', 'was', 'solemn', 'end', 'movie', 'admitted', 'was', 'sweetly', 'done', 'Depp', 'delight', 'surprise', 'am', 'aprehensive', 'next', 'foray', 'Burton', 'Willy', 'Wonka', ""'ll"", 'hold', 'off', 'judging', 'again', 'see', 'work.this', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'Karen', 'Sadler']",Finding Neverland

880025,AAEP58H79J67E,B0007CNXUK,lawlady,"[2, 4]","This movie is the story of how JM Barrie came up with his ideas for Peter Pan and the first showing of the play.  I am not a critic but I know what I like.I did not really like this movie overall, but I liked parts of it enough to give it three stars.I think Johnny Depp is awesome in almost every thing he stars in and he is equally as good in this.  His accent was great and he really made me feel like he was the kid at heart who could create a place such as Neverland and have us believe.  It was as though he became the man he was playing.I did not really care for Kate Winslet or her character but this could be because the character was not fleshed out as much.  She was merely a woman who went along for the ride as JM Barrie and her children bonded. The movie gave no insight into why she was so willing to just go along with them or why she neglected her health when she was the only parent her children had.  However, to Ms. Winslet's credit, the same could be argued of most of the other characters.  The only character who we were given any insight into was Mr. Barrie.THE STORY:Mr. Barrie had just made a play that flopped and then he was moping in the park and met 4 boys and their mother.  The boys are sad over the recent death of their father.  He starts to spend time with them and he brings out their ability to use their imagination and to create plays.  He then starts to create his vision of Neverland and his characters of Peter Pan and the Lost Boys.I liked alot of this movie because it showed how absolutely wonderful imagination is and how it can make you flourish, the way it did for the boys.  Also, it showed how stuffy and unimaginative we are as adults and sometimes it takes a child to show us how to enjoy ourselves.

880026,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0007CNXUK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 4]","I was eager to see ""Finding Neverland"" but I knew that the film had a couple of high hurdles to overcome.  The first is that I loved last year's version of ""Peter Pan"" from director P.J. Hogan, who crafted what I think will be the best version of the beloved story for adults.  Certainly no other version of ""Peter Pan"" has touched upon the depths of the tale of the boy who never grew up.  The second is that I also have fond memories of the television movie ""The Dreamer of Oz,"" which told the story of L. Frank Baum (played by John Ritter) and how he crafted the characters and story of ""The Wizard of Oz.""  ""Finding Neverland"" is in a similar vein, more comparable to ""Dreamchild"" (about ""Alice in Wonderland"") although it is more interested in the magic that was created on stage when the play first premiered than in detailing the specific sources of inspiration.""Finding Neverland"" is about how J. M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) came to write one of the classic children's stories of all time (you start counting them on one hand and ""Peter Pan"" has to be there).  The situation as set up in the film is that Barrie's latest play has been a flop and his financier, Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman) needs another play to keep the theater and the cast afloat.  So Barrie heads off to the park with his journal and his dog to seek inspiration, which is revealed to him through a strategic hole in his newspaper and by the presence of a small boy imprisoned in a dungeon beneath his park bench.So it is that Barrie is introduced to the family of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet), a widow with four sons: George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Propsero), Michael (Luke Spill), and Peter (Freddie Highmore).  Slyvia and her children become not only a source of inspiration for the Lost Boys, Pirates, and Indians of Neverland but the family he never had.  But even in this reimagined version of how ""Peter Pan"" came to be written it is clear that Barrie does not want to be a father.  He wants to be a brother, and eventually we find out why that would be an important gap in his life to be filled.Mary Answell Barrie (Radha Mitchell) is not happy that her husband is seeking inspiration with another woman and her family, and Barrie seems to be on cusp of scandal as he continues to do what he want and writes his new play.  Mary is not a sympathetic figure because it is clear from the start that she has no idea what sort of man she is married to (we can debate exactly what that means, but whatever the interpretation the point is valid).  She thinks that her husband is cheating on her, and one of the ironies of the film is he does not do so, by either the conventional meaning of the term or the privileged meaning it has for her, until after his wife has beaten him to the punch.  Slyvia's mother, Mrs. Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie) disapproves of the relationship between ""Uncle Jimmy"" and her grandchildren and what it means for the prospects of her daughter remarrying.Ultimately ""Finding Neverland"" is about the relationships Barrie had with Sylvia and Peter, more than it is about the creation of the play ""Peter Pan.""  But it is when we get to the final act of this film, adapted by David Magee form Allan Knee's play, that director Marc Forster's movie becomes truly magical.  Barrie knows that he has created a work of genius, approaching this opening night with a supreme confidence he lacked for his work at the start of the film, having assured success by reserving 25 seats in the theater for his play's perfect audience.  But opening night is only the first half of the magic, and the second act brings together the major elements of the story into a sublime moment of beauty and wonder.I was disappointed that there was not more of Barrie's actual play, but then I realized that was because I erroneously thought that in the case of ""Finding Neverland"" the play is the thing.  What sets up the endings of this film is not the play, but the relationships that have been built while we distracting look for the first signs of Captain Hook and Tinkerbelle.  This is a movie where the climax is everything you hoped it would be and redeems whatever shortcomings you see in the film up to that point, even if it is only in retrospect that you understand how it was set up.Depp's performance is incredibly understated by his standards, and I would imagine that an Oscar nomination and perhaps even winning the award could result from this film because of the immense respect and affection he has garnered in recent years with his stellar body of work.  But he is merely a conduit for something larger in this case, and if he is the recipient of the universal reservoir of good will engendered by a story that is about to celebrate its centennial, I have no problem with that.  Winslet continues to create a solid body of work without most people noticing, and while much will be made of Highmore's Peter it is Roud as George, the oldest son who if forced to be an adult in the span of thirty seconds by the circumstances of his life who captures my attention in a film celebrating the boy who never grew up and the man who wrote his story.WARNING: If you find yourself bespelled by ""Finding Neverland"" and want to find out how much of the story is true when you get online, all I can say in the strongest possible terms is DO NOT do that.  It will ruin your memories of this movie forever.  I am not even close to joking on this one and you have all been duly warned.",5,"A fanciful version of how J.M.

880028,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B0007CNXUK,Linda Linguvic,"[0, 5]","This 2004 film is about the writer of the beloved tale of Peter Pan.  Johnny Depp is cast in the lead role of Sir James Barrie, a married London playwright whose career is failing.  However, when he meets a young widow, played by Kate Winslet, and her four young boys, he becomes a friend of that family, much to the displeasure of his own wife as well as the widow's mother, played by Julie Christie.  These are fine roles for all of them.  And the story held my interest.  However, even though the film is set in 1903, I couldn't help viewing it through modern eyes.

The writers could have made it go on and on, bloating it past it's just over an hour and a half time frame.  But they didn't.  With amazing actors Johnny Depp, Kate Winslett, and Dustin Hoffman, the director could have let the cameras linger longer, stargazing to the point of watering down the story.  But he didn't.Finding Neverland tells the story of how the enduring story of Peter Pan came to be.  Johnny Depp plays Scottish playwright Sir James M. Barrie.  Barrie is just coming off a flop of a play that theater manager Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman) underrwrote.  Kate Winslett plays a young widowed mother named Sylvia Llewelyn Davies. She is struggling to raise four boys.  The boys become the inspiration for Barrie's play.  Unfortunately, the story comes at personal cost to Barrie's wife Mary, and Sylvia.Like Johnny Depp, who got comparisons to Michael Jackson in his portrayal of Willy Wonka, Barrie is drawing ire from the Victorian folks as they question not only what is a married man doing spending so much time with a young widow, but what is he doing with four young boys? Mary is neglected as James spends hours playing games with the boys, or walking in the park with Sylvia. Sylvia is socially ostracized, causing her mother to become enraged with Barrie.  She accuses Barrie of being selfish.  There is no doubt that is true.I cannot stress enough that the brilliance and genuine qualities of all the children who acted in this film made this movie.  The looks of sheer delight on their faces as they watched the play looked like pure innocence.Extras include absolutely hilarious outtakes, a short piece on the creation of the movie, where Depp, Winslett, and Hoffman are interviewed, and an even shorter piece on the special effects used in the film.This is a film worth purchasing, as you will want to see it repeated times.  LIke a fine wine, it will ripen each time you see it, with new layers and nuances unfolding, until - one day - you will fall into tears.",5,Lovely,1131321600,"11 7, 2005",2005,2083,"['Finding', 'Neverland', 'wonderful', 'lovely', 'little', 'film', 'as', 'perfect', 'get', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'go', 'bloating', 'just', 'hour', 'half', 'time', 'frame', 'did', ""n't"", 'amazing', 'actors', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'let', 'cameras', 'linger', 'longer', 'stargazing', 'point', 'watering', 'down', 'story', ""didn't.Finding"", 'Neverland', 'story', 'how', 'enduring', 'story', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'came', 'be', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Scottish', 'playwright', 'Sir', 'James', 'M.', 'Barrie', 'Barrie', 'just', 'coming', 'off', 'flop', 'play', 'theater', 'manager', 'Charles', 'Frohman', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'underrwrote', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'young', 'widowed', 'mother', 'named', 'Sylvia', 'Llewelyn', 'Davies', 'struggling', 'raise', 'four', 'boys', 'boys', 'become', 'inspiration', 'Barrie', 'play', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'personal', 'cost', 'Barrie', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Sylvia.Like', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'who', 'got', 'comparisons', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'portrayal', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Barrie', 'drawing', 'ire', 'Victorian', 'folks', 'question', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'married', 'man', 'doing', 'spending', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'young', 'widow', 'what', 'doing', 'four', 'young', 'boys', 'Mary', 'neglected', 'James', 'hours', 'playing', 'games', 'boys', 'walking', 'park', 'Sylvia', 'Sylvia', 'socially', 'ostracized', 'causing', 'mother', 'become', 'enraged', 'Barrie', 'Barrie', 'being', 'selfish', 'doubt', 'true.I', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'enough', 'brilliance', 'genuine', 'qualities', 'children', 'who', 'acted', 'film', 'made', 'movie', 'looks', 'sheer', 'delight', 'watched', 'play', 'looked', 'pure', 'innocence.Extras', 'include', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'outtakes', 'short', 'piece', 'creation', 'movie', 'where', 'Depp', 'Winslett', 'Hoffman', 'are', 'interviewed', 'even', 'shorter', 'piece', 'special', 'effects', 'used', 'film.This', 'film', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'repeated', 'times', 'fine', 'wine', 'will', 'ripen', 'time', 'see', 'new', 'layers', 'nuances', 'unfolding', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'fall', 'tears']",Finding Neverland

It's not a blockbuster kind of movie, but it will stand the rest of time. Years from now, when many of today's hit movies may be viewed as quaint and laughable, this movie will still be enjoyed.This is the movie version of the events that inspired J.M. Barrie to write the classic play, ""Peter Pan"", over one hundred years ago.James Barrie [Johnny Depp] was a popular British playwright. He was devastated when one of his plays flopped. Soon afterwards, in a London Park he frequented, he met a remarkable family - Sylvia Llewlyn Davis [Kate Winslett] and her four young boys, Jack, George, Michael and Peter. James had a childless, loveless marriage with Mary [Radha Mitchell]. Sylvia was a widow. Though the movie doesn't say so, I assume she had had a joyous, loving relationship with her dead husband.Barrie was well off. Sylvia was poor, although she came from a wealthy family, headed by her dominating mother [Julie Christie]. As Barrie bonded with Sylvia and her boys, his imagination began to create Peter Pan, Neverland, and its inhabitants. The movie shows the process of Barrie's imagination to great effect.I have read that the movie is not historically accurate because it does not put some events in correct chronological order. This fact may bother historians, but it shouldn't deter most moviegoers who have little knowledge of Barrie's life to begin with.As always, Depp gives an amazing performance. Like the movie, Depp will be remembered fondly years from now.

Consider the following two facts about Finding Neverland: (a) there is virtually no profanity or sex and (b) it features a protagonist who is able to have a platonic, mature relationship with a woman who is not his wife, a relationship that he partakes in solely for the good of the woman and her family. But I think I liked the film mostly because it deals with one of my favorite topics: the human imagination. Some movies (Star Wars, etc.) are exercises in the human imagination, but don't really delve into how the exercise of imagination can affect normal everyday life. There is a tendency in some people to discount ""escapist"" cinema as being less worthy of artistic or cultural merit than movies that deal with ""real"" subjects. But as this movie shows, the fantastic can influence the real world in meaningful ways, and vice versa. It is the relationship with the widow's four sons that provided the impetus for J. M. Barrie to write his classic ""Peter Pan"" stageplay, and in Barrie's overactive imagination the boys found the strengh to deal with very real tragedies that had befallen their young lives. As C. S. Lewis (a writer of the fantastic whose relationship with another woman's sons is strangely similar to Barrie's) once commented, the only people who object to escapism are jailers.",5,Shows the power of the human imagination ...,1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,1423,"['movie', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'increasingly', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'make', 'least', 'unable', 'make', 'well', 'Consider', 'following', 'two', 'facts', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'virtually', 'profanity', 'sex', 'b', 'protagonist', 'who', 'able', 'have', 'platonic', 'mature', 'relationship', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'wife', 'relationship', 'solely', 'good', 'woman', 'family', 'think', 'liked', 'film', 'mostly', 'one', 'favorite', 'topics', 'human', 'imagination', 'movies', 'Star', 'Wars', 'etc', 'are', 'human', 'imagination', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'delve', 'how', 'exercise', 'imagination', 'can', 'affect', 'normal', 'everyday', 'life', 'tendency', 'people', 'discount', 'escapist', 'cinema', 'being', 'less', 'worthy', 'artistic', 'cultural', 'merit', 'movies', 'deal', 'real', 'subjects', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'can', 'influence', 'real', 'world', 'meaningful', 'ways', 'vice', 'versa', 'relationship', 'widow', 'four', 'sons', 'provided', 'impetus', 'J.', 'M.', 'Barrie', 'write', 'classic', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'stageplay', 'Barrie', 'overactive', 'imagination', 'boys', 'found', 'strengh', 'deal', 'very', 'real', 'tragedies', 'had', 'befallen', 'young', 'lives', 'C.', 'S.', 'Lewis', 'writer', 'fantastic', 'relationship', 'woman', 'sons', 'strangely', 'similar', 'Barrie', 'once', 'commented', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'object', 'escapism', 'are', 'jailers']",Finding Neverland

I was in two minds about getting it because, although I love the story of Peter Pan, but I wasn't sure how a film about how J.M. Barrie was inspired to write Peter Pan would be.Boy was I wrong.By the end of this film, I was in tears, and that's mighty embarrassing. Even my dad shed a little tear - something he still denies. It's a very powerful film, and totally sucks you in. It leaves you in a state of shock, wonder and numb all at the same time.Johnny Depp was absolutely fabulous (as always) as a very suave J.M. Barrie and his Scottish accent (coming from a Scot) was flawless. It sounded very strange when he first speaks, I didn't realise he was playing a Scot, so I jumped when he came out with the accent. He managed to perfect the accent, unlike some stars with different accents (anyone remember Keanu Reeves' fatal attempt at an English accent in that Dracula movie?) The gorgeous Kate Winslet was perfect as always, playing an English rose. I wasn't keen on the little kids, they seemed very bratty, and emotionless. Dustin Hoffman (who was also in Hook), was a fabulous, although underused addition to the movie. He lost the tip of a finger and performed one day of shooting on morphine (so that explains it!) And most extras wanted to shake his hand when they were entering the theatre. And look out for Mackenzie Crook stealing the two scenes he's in from under Johnny's nose. Also Kelly MacDonald playing Peter Pan towards the end.This film moves effortlessly from scene to scene, and I found myself getting more & more involved & lost in the story. This is one movie that will definitely stand the test of time. It was extremely interesting to see J.M. Barrie being ""inspired"" by the Davies children, with scenes which you will no doubt recognise from all the different versions of Peter Pan there have been.This is definitely a family movie, although I was quite shocked at the hints of paedophilia in the movie. I only noticed this was because about a week ago, I watched Happiness, and that was quite heavily featured.

880048,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0007CNXUK,Michael Butts,"[1, 5]","Only a week ago, I watched HOOK, and although it was a well done film, I've never been a real PETER PAN fan, so it was with some hesitance that I decided to view FINDING NEVERLAND.  But this wonderful and brilliant film is not so much about how J. M. Barrie came to create Peter Pan, but the story of relationships touched by love, admiration and most importantly imagination.  Barrie was Peter Pan, a grown man who still wanted to be a little boy.  As embodied by the amazingly versatile Johnny Depp, J.M. Barrie becomes a symbol of that youthful innocence we all would love to maintain.  It is a deeply realized, thoughtful and outstanding addition to the amazing repertoire of characters Depp has given us in the past few years.  For once, Depp doesn't look like the eternal teenager, using his dark good looks more as an adult than any film he's done, ironic in that his character still wants to be a boy. Depp never allows his character to sink into predictable maudlin behavior with the Davises; he maintains an honest, forthright position with them and his social climbing wife as well.  In finally taking Sylvia to Neverland, in a heart-rending finale, Depp shows us the depth of his performance.  Kate Winslet continues her chameleonic talents in the role of Sylvia; her every movement, gesture and dialogue carries the weight of a woman who has lost her husband and is facing her own imminent death.  Never self-effacing, or mawkish, Winslet's performance is a glowing one, and when she goes to neverland, it is a three hanky moment.  Freddie Highmore as the young Peter, a little boy who seems to be growing up too fast, is devastatingly brilliant.  A cute Haley Joel Osment clone, Highmore brings such depth and believability to this role, he is amazing, and should have garnered a Best Supporting Actor nomination and win, for this beautifully performed role.  The scene in which he asks Depp why his Mommy had to die is heartbreaking and beautiful.  Director Mark Forster rounds out his cast with marvelous performances from the rest of the little boys; Julie Christie brings a depth to a cliche role as the rather diabolical mother of Winslet, but as we get to know her better, we can see where her motherly love is taking her.  Christie hasn't had a role this good in years; and of course, the superb Dustin Hoffman gives us a remarkably understated performance as the producer who funds Barrie's plays, and his moment of amazement when he realizes Peter Pan is going to be successful is typical Hoffman brilliance.  Radha Mitchell (Pitch Black, Open Water) gives a marvelously restrained performance as Barrie's wife, whose reverence for social climbing ultimately results in the destruction of their marriage; it isn't really Barrie's spending time with the Davises, but the fact that the two were mismatched from the beginning that separates them.FINDING NEVERLAND is one of my favorite films I've viewed in the past year, and its Oscar nominations were richly deserved.  Johnny Depp would have stood a good chance of winning Best Actor had it not been the same year as Jamie Foxx's brilliant Ray Charles.  But Depp has range and endurance and I know one day he's going to be up at the podium, and deservedly so.  Don't let the movie's ""quietness"" keep you from viewing it.  It is vastly entertaining and really what moviemaking is all about.",5,THE ROAD TO NEVERLAND,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,3361,"['Only', 'week', 'ago', 'watched', 'HOOK', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'film', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'real', 'PETER', 'PAN', 'fan', 'was', 'hesitance', 'decided', 'view', 'FINDING', 'NEVERLAND', 'wonderful', 'brilliant', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'how', 'J.', 'M.', 'Barrie', 'came', 'create', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'story', 'relationships', 'touched', 'love', 'admiration', 'most', 'importantly', 'imagination', 'Barrie', 'was', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'grown', 'man', 'who', 'still', 'wanted', 'be', 'little', 'boy', 'embodied', 'amazingly', 'versatile', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'symbol', 'youthful', 'innocence', 'would', 'love', 'maintain', 'deeply', 'realized', 'thoughtful', 'outstanding', 'addition', 'amazing', 'repertoire', 'characters', 'Depp', 'given', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'once', 'Depp', ""n't"", 'look', 'eternal', 'teenager', 'using', 'dark', 'good', 'more', 'adult', 'film', 'done', 'ironic', 'character', 'still', 'be', 'boy', 'Depp', 'never', 'character', 'sink', 'predictable', 'maudlin', 'behavior', 'Davises', 'honest', 'forthright', 'position', 'social', 'climbing', 'wife', 'as', 'well', 'finally', 'taking', 'Sylvia', 'Neverland', 'heart-rending', 'finale', 'Depp', 'depth', 'performance', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'chameleonic', 'talents', 'role', 'Sylvia', 'movement', 'gesture', 'dialogue', 'weight', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'husband', 'facing', 'own', 'imminent', 'death', 'Never', 'self-effacing', 'mawkish', 'Winslet', 'performance', 'glowing', 'one', 'when', 'neverland', 'three', 'hanky', 'moment', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'young', 'Peter', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'be', 'growing', 'up', 'too', 'fast', 'devastatingly', 'brilliant', 'cute', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'clone', 'Highmore', 'such', 'depth', 'believability', 'role', 'amazing', 'should', 'have', 'garnered', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'nomination', 'win', 'beautifully', 'performed', 'role', 'scene', 'Depp', 'why', 'Mommy', 'had', 'die', 'heartbreaking', 'beautiful', 'Director', 'Mark', 'Forster', 'out', 'cast', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'rest', 'little', 'boys', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'depth', 'cliche', 'role', 'rather', 'diabolical', 'mother', 'Winslet', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'motherly', 'love', 'taking', 'Christie', ""n't"", 'had', 'role', 'good', 'years', 'course', 'superb', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'remarkably', 'understated', 'performance', 'producer', 'who', 'funds', 'Barrie', 'plays', 'moment', 'amazement', 'when', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'going', 'be', 'successful', 'typical', 'Hoffman', 'brilliance', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'Open', 'Water', 'marvelously', 'restrained', 'performance', 'Barrie', 'wife', 'reverence', 'social', 'climbing', 'ultimately', 'results', 'destruction', 'marriage', ""n't"", 'really', 'Barrie', 'spending', 'time', 'Davises', 'fact', 'two', 'were', 'mismatched', 'beginning', 'them.FINDING', 'NEVERLAND', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'past', 'year', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'were', 'richly', 'deserved', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'would', 'have', 'stood', 'good', 'chance', 'winning', 'Best', 'Actor', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'same', 'year', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'brilliant', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Depp', 'range', 'endurance', 'know', 'one', 'day', 'going', 'be', 'up', 'podium', 'deservedly', 'so', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'movie', 'quietness', 'keep', 'viewing', 'vastly', 'entertaining', 'really', 'what', 'moviemaking']",Finding Neverland

Finding Neverland is an outstanding movie for one key reason; it tells a wonderful story wonderfully.  And the story itself, based on one summer in the life of the man who penned ""Peter Pan,"" is about wonder and imagination recaptured through the innocence of childhood.No planets blow up, there's no nudity, and I don't recall hearing any zingy four-letter words, and I suspect that's why the few reviewers who were critical of the film did not enjoy it.  It's not an action flick; it's more from the Merchant Ivory school of film.  This is a film for those in the mood to be told a quiet and emotionally honest tale.  And yes, I'm sure that ""Finding Neverland"" capitalizes on the use of fictionalized history, and that's fine with me.  If I'd wanted to watch a documentary, I would have, but I wanted to make popcorn and enjoy a movie about a man who resurrects his youthful imagination by befriending three young fatherless boys and their ill mother. I enjoyed it famously.Johnny Depp is rapidly becoming one of my favorite actors, and he is joined by a talented entourage, including Kate Winslet, Julie Christy, and Dustin Hoffman.  The children actors in this film were phenomenal.

I can imagine some people might be disappointed that the film isn't as ""magical"" as ""Peter Pan,"" the beloved play whose creation it depicts. But Forster isn't creating a fantasy; he is telling a story about real people and the resources of imagination, love and faith they rely on to stay alive. The movie takes some liberties with the story of how James M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) befriends Sylvia Llewellyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her young sons; for example, Sylvia had five sons, not four, and her husband, Arthur, was still alive when Barrie met the family. But emotionally the film feels right: as Barrie takes Sylvia and the boys on a magical mystery tour of his fecund imagination, the film switches between reality and fantasy with masterful aplomb, and never fails to engage and move its audience. ""Finding Neverland"" is generous enough to find sympathy even for its less likable characters--Barrie's beautiful but chilly wife Mary (Radha Mitchell) and Sylvia's staid, disapproving mother, Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie). Even though Barrie briefly imagines Emma as Captain Hook, she is not a monster, merely a loving but overly starchy woman with very fixed ideas about what is proper and what isn't. The performances are every bit as excellent as you could wish, and the photography and production design are marvelous. Kelly Macdonald, seen briefly as the actress playing Peter Pan at its premiere, is so good that one hopes she'll get to play the role in earnest before too long. (I must also say a kind word for the actor who plays Nana.) I could hear sobs from the audience toward the end of this film, and my guess is that if you don't reach for your handkerchief at least once, you're probably a Captain Hook type yourself. (And if you don't want to go out immediately and buy a Newfoundland after seeing Porthos, the dog that inspired Nana, you just don't like dogs!)",5,"Gentle, poignant and lovingly detailed.",1102982400,"12 14, 2004",2004,2058,"['Marc', 'Forster', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'poignant', 'impeccably', 'crafted', 'testimonial', 'power', 'imagination', 'how', 'human', 'spirit', 'face', 'tragedy', 'can', 'imagine', 'people', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', ""n't"", 'magical', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'beloved', 'play', 'creation', 'Forster', ""n't"", 'creating', 'fantasy', 'telling', 'story', 'real', 'people', 'resources', 'imagination', 'love', 'faith', 'rely', 'stay', 'alive', 'movie', 'liberties', 'story', 'how', 'James', 'M.', 'Barrie', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Sylvia', 'Llewellyn', 'Davies', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'young', 'sons', 'example', 'Sylvia', 'had', 'five', 'sons', 'not', 'four', 'husband', 'Arthur', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'when', 'Barrie', 'met', 'family', 'emotionally', 'film', 'feels', 'right', 'Barrie', 'Sylvia', 'boys', 'magical', 'mystery', 'tour', 'fecund', 'imagination', 'film', 'switches', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'masterful', 'aplomb', 'never', 'engage', 'move', 'audience', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'generous', 'enough', 'find', 'sympathy', 'even', 'less', 'likable', 'characters', 'Barrie', 'beautiful', 'chilly', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Sylvia', 'staid', 'disapproving', 'mother', 'Emma', 'Maurier', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Even', 'Barrie', 'briefly', 'imagines', 'Emma', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'not', 'monster', 'merely', 'loving', 'overly', 'starchy', 'woman', 'very', 'fixed', 'ideas', 'what', 'proper', 'what', ""n't"", 'performances', 'are', 'bit', 'as', 'excellent', 'could', 'wish', 'photography', 'production', 'design', 'are', 'marvelous', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'seen', 'briefly', 'actress', 'playing', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'premiere', 'so', 'good', 'one', ""'ll"", 'get', 'play', 'role', 'earnest', 'too', 'long', 'must', 'also', 'say', 'kind', 'word', 'actor', 'who', 'Nana', 'could', 'hear', 'sobs', 'audience', 'end', 'film', 'guess', 'do', ""n't"", 'reach', 'handkerchief', 'least', 'once', ""'re"", 'probably', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'type', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'out', 'immediately', 'buy', 'Newfoundland', 'seeing', 'Porthos', 'dog', 'inspired', 'Nana', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'dogs']",Finding Neverland
880052,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0007CNXUK,mirasreviews,"[1, 4]","""Finding Neverland"" is a fictionalized account of the relationship between Scottish playwright James Barrie and the Llewelyn Davies family that inspired Barrie to write the classic children's story ""Peter Pan"". The film was written by David Magee, based on a portion of Allan Knee's play ""The Man Who Wrote Peter Pan"" and directed by Marc Forster of ""Monster's Ball"" fame.In London, 1904, James Barrie (Johnny Depp) is a playwright in need of fresh ideas. Walking his dog in the park one day, he meets a young widow, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet), and her four sons, George, Jack, Peter, and Michael. The boy's playfulness and earnestness fire James' imagination, and he makes regular trips to the park to spend time with them. This unusual relationship with the boys and their mother raises a few eyebrows, including those of James' wife, Mary (Radha Mitchell), and Sylvia's socially conscious mother, Mme. du Maurier (Julie Christie). But James is quite fond of Sylvia and her sons, and the boys become a sort of muse. Peter (Freddie Highmore), a thoughtful, melancholy child still grieving the loss of his father, lends his name to ""Peter Pan"", as James writes the fanciful play about ""the irrepressible spirit of youth"".""Finding Neverland"", although fictionalized, is an interesting exploration of the creative process: How James Barrie's own childhood and those of the Llewelyn Davies children were translated into art -into a play whose popularity seems endless. This is a ""period"" film, but not really conventional. Gemma Jackson's production design and Roberto Schaefer's cinematography are striking from the film's first minutes. ""Finding Neverland"" is part period drama, part tear-jerker, and part children's fantasy. The fantasy sequences are spare and skillfully blended into the film to avoid being overbearing or incongruous. The cast is impressive. Johnny Depp conveys the perfect blend of maturity and playfulness necessary to make us charmed, instead of bewildered, by James Barrie's carrying on with the children. Barrie's rapport with those kids is palpable. Julie Christie's role as Sylvia's uptight mother is small but crucial and wonderfully articulated. Dustin Hoffman is the skeptical, sensible theatrical producer, who thankfully has a sense of humor. ""Finding Neverland"" injects humor in just the right places, so it never becomes leaden, even when the drama turns serious.This is a beautiful film to look at, and its oscillations between playful and serious, reality and fantasy, prevent the story from ever stagnating. An embellished story about the creation of ""Peter Pan"" won't appeal to everyone, but I can't imagine anyone doing it better than ""Finding Neverland"". And I never could stand ""Peter Pan"", so that's not a qualification to enjoy this movie.The DVD (Miramax 2005 release): Bonus features include 3 mini-documentaries, 3 deleted scenes with optional commentary, outtakes (5 minutes), and an audio commentary. ""The Magic of Finding Neverland"" (15 minutes) is a general ""making-of"" piece featuring interviews with cast, producers, and director Marc Forster. This includes some discussion of various versions of ""Peter Pan"" and the actor's careers. ""Creating Neverland"" (3 minutes) is about the film's visual effects. ""On the Red Carpet"" (2 minutes) features interviews with cast, producers, and even Hilary Clinton, on the red carpet at the film's various premieres. The audio commentary by director Marc Forster, producer Richard Gladstein, and writer David Magee is the most worthwhile of the bonus features. It's not scripted, but the commentary is full of information. The three men discuss everything that comes to mind for each scene, and in doing so manage to cover many facets of the film and its history. They talk about filming, cast, locations, technical stuff, and writer David Magee compares the events depicted in the film to Allan Knee's play, his script, and the real story of James Barrie and the Llewelyn Davies family. English captions are available for the film, as well as subtitles in French and Spanish.

The same can be said of Johnny Depp.  As the main ""grown-ups"" in this film about four boys, it was extremely important that the actors portraying the children's parent (Winslet) and best-friend (Depp) love children and be able to relate to them not as kids, but as people.  That's why I love this movie.  Johnny, Kate, and the entire story treat children as they deserve to be treated: as real, important, awesome people.  This movie is awesome because it respected, nourished, and loved everything that is brilliant about childhood, and the adult actors obviously respected and loved childhood an equal amount.This is a calming, beautiful, happy story that was snubbed out of its obvious best picture win because the Academy has no use for happy, loving, family films.

Depp plays playwright J. M. Barrie, who after his most recent play bombs, meets widow Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her four boys while in the park.  Soon enough, a friendship is forged with Sylvia, and a bond is formed with her sons, including young Peter who may have grown up too quickly.  Even though Barrie's distant wife (Radha Mitchell) and Sylvia's mother (Julie Christie) disapprove, Barrie continues the relationship with the family, inspiring him to write Peter Pan.  The cast does fantastic work with Depp giving one of the finest performances of his career, while Kate Winslet is Kate Winslet: giving the perfect blend of subtlety and believeability to her character.

880063,A2M3K0QDZ4IUUF,B0007CNXUK,Never Lander,"[1, 1]","Best film of my entire life.  I am an avid fan of Peter Pan, both the play, the musical and the Disney version.This film blends sweetness, sadness and virtual brilliance.  Johnny Depp plays a perfect JM Barrie, a man torn between childhood and adult responsibilites.  Barrie himself, mirror Peter Pan a bit of course.If one reads ""Inventing Wonderland"" by Jackie Wullschlager, it is clear that there can be severl interpretations of the creation of Peter Pan, Winnie the Pooh, The Owl and the Pussycat and Through the Looking Glass.  The problem is one of paradigm shifts.In Victorian England, children were seen as the epitomy of society and romanticized.  For a grown man to use children as a muse was not seen as something odd or strange.Johnny Depp shows the perfect balance of reservation and release when he is with the children through his imagination.  His relationship with his wife is shown beautifully.I too would have to disagree with the writer that stated that the ""real story"" of the creation of Peter Pan would diminish the love of this film.  Knowing the ""true story"" simply allowed me to fill in blanks that the film glossed over or changed.Biggest change in my opinion was the change of JM Barrie's childhood muses' mother to a widow from a married woman (which was the true story).The small boy that played Peter was so good, Johnny Depp recommended him by name for Charlie in Tim Burton's amazing remake of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" which was closer to the book than the wonderful but flawed Gene Wilder version that painted Willy Wonka as an eccentric rather than a sadistic character.JM Barrie was Peter Pan and this film boasts a deeply moving  performance from both Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp.  The film will move you to tears many times.  It is remnicent of Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" in its ultimate goal, to always have a zest for life and live life to its fullest.The best scene in the film to me was Johnny Depp in his writers chair staring out the window and his wife's longing for him to let her into his world.Bottom line, Finding Neverland may be a ""fudge"" on some facts but the story breaks down the creation well and gives us an insight into a timeframe and a man.

880064,A1129LM24YWSZV,B0007CNXUK,"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw""","[1, 3]","Finding Neverland is a beautiful family film about playwright James Barrie (played by Johnny Depp). Barrie, who has unfortunately just weathered the commercial failure of his latest play, happens upon a fatherless family in the park. Sylvia Llewelyn Davies' husband has passed away, and she has been left to care for four very rambunctious boys: Peter, Jack, George, and Michael. Barrie falls in love with the young boys, and to an extent with their mother, because he discovers they stoke his own child-like imagination. Together, Barrie and the boys are pirates, cowboys, circus performers, and more. Inspired by the little family, and particularly by Peter Davies (played with aching accuracy by Freddie Highmore), Barrie pens the stage play Peter Pan, which is a resounding commerical and critical success for him.This movie is a beautiful story about imagination, renewal, and growing up. Young Peter is scarred by the death of his father, and he observes his mother's illness with growing trepidation. He is an old soul in a young body, which seems to be why Barrie names his own primary character after him. Barrie hopes that Peter can feel young again, can rediscover the carefree life of childhood. Of course, there are complications. Barrie's wife, Mary (played by Radha Mitchell), doesn't appreciate all of the time he spends with the Davies family, nor of the affection he feels for Sylvia. As well, Sylvia's mother disapproves of Barrie's presence in her daughter's life. However, our protagonist overcomes both obstacles, and the resulting story is both hopeful and triumphant.The performances in the film were particularly good. Depp is subtle and endearing as Barrie, playing a character much more true-to-life than his turns as fantastical Jack Sparrow, Willy Wonka, and Edward Scissorhands. Winslet is also excellent. Some of the scenes in which she revealed and dealt with Sylvia's illness were wonderful little gems in the film. She makes Sylvia such a likable character that it is difficult not to root for her whole-heartedly. Also, Freddie Highmore was astonishing as young Peter. I loved him in the scenes at the premiere of the play. A surprising new talent.I also enjoyed the way the film invited the viewer into Barrie's imagination. During some scenes, flashes of what Barrie imagines (flying children, a ship tossed on rough seas, a dancing bear) are interspersed with dull reality. It was a very effective technique.",4,Magical family film,1131062400,"11 4, 2005",2005,2446,"['Finding', 'Neverland', 'beautiful', 'family', 'film', 'playwright', 'James', 'Barrie', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Barrie', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'weathered', 'commercial', 'failure', 'latest', 'play', 'fatherless', 'family', 'park', 'Sylvia', 'Llewelyn', 'Davies', 'husband', 'passed', 'away', 'been', 'left', 'care', 'four', 'very', 'rambunctious', 'boys', 'Peter', 'Jack', 'George', 'Michael', 'Barrie', 'love', 'young', 'boys', 'extent', 'mother', 'stoke', 'own', 'child-like', 'imagination', 'Together', 'Barrie', 'boys', 'are', 'pirates', 'cowboys', 'circus', 'performers', 'more', 'Inspired', 'little', 'family', 'particularly', 'Peter', 'Davies', 'played', 'aching', 'accuracy', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'Barrie', 'stage', 'play', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'resounding', 'commerical', 'critical', 'success', 'him.This', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'story', 'imagination', 'renewal', 'growing', 'up', 'Young', 'Peter', 'scarred', 'death', 'father', 'mother', 'illness', 'growing', 'trepidation', 'old', 'soul', 'young', 'body', 'be', 'why', 'Barrie', 'own', 'primary', 'character', 'Barrie', 'Peter', 'can', 'feel', 'young', 'again', 'can', 'rediscover', 'carefree', 'life', 'childhood', 'course', 'are', 'complications', 'Barrie', 'wife', 'Mary', 'played', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'time', 'Davies', 'family', 'affection', 'Sylvia', 'As', 'well', 'Sylvia', 'mother', 'disapproves', 'Barrie', 'presence', 'daughter', 'life', 'However', 'protagonist', 'obstacles', 'resulting', 'story', 'hopeful', 'triumphant.The', 'performances', 'film', 'were', 'particularly', 'good', 'Depp', 'subtle', 'endearing', 'Barrie', 'playing', 'character', 'much', 'more', 'true-to-life', 'turns', 'fantastical', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'Winslet', 'also', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'revealed', 'dealt', 'Sylvia', 'illness', 'were', 'wonderful', 'little', 'gems', 'film', 'Sylvia', 'likable', 'character', 'difficult', 'not', 'root', 'whole-heartedly', 'Also', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'was', 'astonishing', 'young', 'Peter', 'loved', 'scenes', 'premiere', 'play', 'surprising', 'new', 'talent.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'film', 'invited', 'viewer', 'Barrie', 'imagination', 'scenes', 'flashes', 'what', 'Barrie', 'imagines', 'flying', 'children', 'ship', 'tossed', 'rough', 'seas', 'dancing', 'bear', 'are', 'interspersed', 'dull', 'reality', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'technique']",Finding Neverland

880067,A2E18ZUBLPJ8RY,B0007CNXUK,N. Williams,"[3, 8]","I was surprised how much I enjoyed Finding Neverland. I thought the acting and story were wonderful and well played. However after doing some research I see again that Hollywood likes to manipulate the facts. Although its True Barrie had a strong connection with the boys in the story, the true story is far more tradgic. Many would liken Barrie to Micheal Jackson in that his love for children may have bordered on paedophilia (a controvery that has surrounded Barrie for a long time), although the boys all denied it and nothing was every proven.Tragically one children the oldest, George was killed in WW1, six years later Micheal drowned mysteriously, with his hands were tied to those of his best male Rupert Buxton. Some speculate that the two were gay and commited suicde together, although no one knows for sure.  Peter Davies always resented the character he had inspired and drank himself to poverty and ruin, eventually killing himself by jumping in front of a tube train.Other controvery surrounds Barrie. One major one that is not noted in the movie is that Barrie himself forged his name into Sylvia Davies will replacing his name Jimmy with the name of Jenny, a sister of the nurse Mary who looked after Sylvia.When Barrie died in 1937 he cut the two surviving brothers (Jack and Nicholas) from his will.There is more but find out for yourself if you are interested.....The more you learn about the truth behind James Barrie the more you see how truely flawed the new movie is. Although dont let this stop you from enjoying it and the story it tells. However out of respect for the real characters involved be sure you understand that this movie is very much fictional and that the real story is far less enchanting, a bit disturbing and truely tragic.

I am a long time fan of both Depp and ""Peter Pan"".  Also, the characters are real, and the play is real and the story is, in the majority, true.  I'm not sure which facts the other reviewer thinks were fudged.  However, the play, Peter Pan, is wonderful.  Although I knew that the inspiration for Peter Pan was a ""real boy"", I didn't know he was one of the talented DuMaurier family.  Besides showing the story of how Peter Pan was written, the film gives a quick history lesson on the life of women at the turn of the 20th century.  Kate Winslett's character is left penniless with four young boys to raise.  Still she resists the demands of the mother, who helps support her family, by allowing James Barrie to become part of their circle.  She realizes that he will contribute the male presence that her children need.  She also sees that her grieving children seem happier when they are with Barrie.  Barrie has his own problems with a career which started with a blaze of glory, a recent play which flopped and a wife who is more interested in the reflected glory she thought he would give her than trying to understand her husband.  The quixotic Depp, as the Scots playwright, includes the sparkle that he has shown in such films as ""Chocolat"" and ""Pirates"".  You may not like him, but you have to allow that he is extremely talented.  Dustin Hoffman is his usual wonderful self as the theatre producer who doesn't understand the new play, but goes along with it on the strength of Barrie's past inate theatre sense, as exasperating as it is.  Julie Christie, aging with grace and beauty, also gives a marvelous performance as Winslett's mother.  The boys are wonderful, and let's not forget Kelly MacDonald in her cameo role as ""Peter Pan"".  She makes me wish that she would become involved in a real stage production of Peter Pan and take her place alongside such as Maude Adams and Mary Martin in the pantheon of actresses who have played the boy who would not grow up.I can't find anything not to like about this film.

Rarely do we get to watch a movie in which the story is filled with so much fantasy, imagination, and spirit that will keep us entertained throughout the movie.The story starts off with James Barrie, a Scottish playwright whose most recent work is a failure. One day in the park, he meets Sylvia Davies, a widow, and her four boys and strikes up a conversation with him. Little by little, he becomes closer to them, and gets inspired to write a new play, one that would be one of the greatest classics of our time.The film focuses mainly on Barrie's relationship with the Davies family, and by viewing small things such as the children's behavior, how he created Peter Pan and the Lost Boys, and added the pirates and the Indians to create a magical masterpiece.Marc Forster, the director of this movie (who also directed Monster's Ball) gives us magic in this story inspired by the life of James Barrie, the author of `Peter Pan'. Johnny Depp acted flawlessly as J.M.Barrie. His expressions (along with the accent) were perfect, and his performance laudable. The rest of the cast, including Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman and Julie Christie also acted incredibly well. However, I was really amazed by the performance of Freddie Highmore, the young boy who acted as Peter Davies in the movie, especially towards the end of the movie.I think this is one of the best movies to be released this year.

880079,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0007CNXUK,RMurray847,"[1, 3]","A criticism frequently leveled against this film is that it isn't very accurate biographically.  In my opinion, this totally misses the point.  First, the film was never postured as ""The Life Story of J.M. Barrie.""  It is a fictional speculation, inspired by actual events, as to what might have gone into the creation of PETER PAN.I know from reading interviews with writers that one of the questions they are most frequently asked is:  ""Where Do you get your ideas?""  This movie shows how that sort of thing can happen...how inspiration comes from circumstance coupled with imagination.  It's a beautiful evocation of how artists experience events and how their work is informed.  Obviously, each artist is inspired in different ways, but the movie feels RIGHT in its delicate tone when it comes to how J.M. Barrie might have conceived PAN.There's also a wonderful story here about how important the child in all of us might be.  J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp, the best argument for the importance of the child within the man), a famous playwright, has discovered that his work has become a drudgery.  He isn't inspired by his life of wealth and position.  He isn't inspired by his attractive wife...who is willing to put up with a lot from Barrie (to her credit), but doesn't offer him much in return (to her debit).  Barrie accidentally meets up with a young widow and her several sons, and is immediately drawn to them.  The widow (a radiant Kate Winslet) is swept up by meeting a ""celebrity"" and the two develop a relationship that is never sexual, but is a deep friendship, built around the fact that Barrie loves her sons, and is able to play with them in a way that no man ever has before.  He knows how to spark the imagination of the kids, and they spark his.  He takes them on elaborate flights of fancy.  Winslet is thrilled to be with a man who can make her kids happy again.  And he dotes on her.  Her mother, played by Julie Christie, disapproves of this man who has entered the lives of her family.  The relationship is unseemly, and the ""playing"" is unseemly too.  So the movie offers a tug of war between being ""mature"" and ""manly"" with ""fun"" and ""childish.""  It argues, very well, that a rounded person needs a bit of both.Barrie certainly is a man who perhaps has kept a bit too much of the child in him.  But, the film also shows that it's this very childishness that enables him to conceive of PETER PAN.  The story of PAN has resonated with children for over a century, despite all the generational changes.  He obviously tapped something deep in the human psyche.  He couldn't have done it without his impish side.  Yet, late in the film, Barrie must be strong and mature...and the man in him knows when to come out and take charge.The movie itself is a treat.  Beautiful sets and costumes, including some really terrific looks at backstage life and the way shows created special effects over a century ago.  It's lighted in lovely, rich tones.  When the film ventures outdoors, it's suffused with life.  The acting is impeccable all around.  Depp and Winslet are great.  Young Freddie Highmore, as Peter, is really, really good.  If you liked Haley Joel Osment in SIXTH SENSE, you'll appreciate Highmore even more...his emotions are even more open.  Rhadha Mitchell, as Barrie's wife, is good...she manages to be both sympathetic and villainous at the same time.  Dustin Hoffman has fun in a small role, and Julie Christie is really good...terrific to see her in a substantial role again.I really couldn't find any major faults in the movie.  It is not fast paced, but never drags.  It's okay for kids.  And it is tear-jerker of epic proportions that actually earns its tears.  There is a scene near the end when Winslet's character gets a private showing of PETER PAN.  From the start of that scene until the end of the movie, I challenge you to keep the tears away.  And the final image of the movie...well, all I can say is that in the movie theater, we heard more than a few people gasping back their tears simply to prevent out and out weeping.  And what's great is that even though we cry...it isn't a depressing movie.

880081,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0007CNXUK,Robert Moore,"[3, 4]","I know very little about the actual circumstances about J. M. Barrie's composition of PETER PAN and so won't join the debate here about how accurate this film is. After all, it states at the opening that it was ""inspired"" by actual events, and that gives the filmmakers a very wide degree of latitude. And although there are those inside the film's narrative who want to turn Barrie's frienship with a widowed mother and her four young boys into something scandalous, those in control of the making of the film refuse to allow their characters to do so. The film ends up being not about romance, though there is clearly an affection between the characters portrayed by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, but about true friendship, about the sheer caring about one another because of our shared humanity.The story is simple: famed Edwardian playwright J. M. Barrie, coming off a flop, meets and befriends a widow and her four children, and the imaginative games he plays with the boys becomes the basis for his eternal classic PETER PAN, the title character taking his name from the most resistant and most damaged of the four boys. In truth not a great deal more happens in the film (though what does is weighty and significant), but nonetheless the film has an air of richness and fullness. To the very end, what is most striking is the true and disinterested nature of the affection all feel for one another.Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet are both outstanding in the lead roles, but the cast is strong from top to bottom. There is some irony that Dustin Hoffman plays the theatre impresario Charles Frohman given the fact that he played the character of Captain Hook in the oddish version of the story that starred Robin Williams. I will add a slightly polemical note and state that Depp belongs to that small but select group of people not named Jamie Foxx who did not deserve a nomination for Best Actor more than did Paul Giamatti for SIDEWAYS, an outrage that stands out as the greatest absurdity in all of the years that I have followed the Oscars. Depp is very, very fine, and had Giamatti gotten his incredibly well deserved nomination, I would not have minded in the least Depp getting one as well. But the truth is that this year Jamie Foxx deserves to win, Paul Giamatti was next most deserving of a nomination, and the final three spots should have been fought for by the four who gathered the four other spots.

880086,AO19QQOF7E2SX,B0007CNXUK,roger,"[2, 3]","""Finding Neverland"" is the story of a man who doesn't want to grow up, and writes the story of a boy who never does. The boy is Peter Pan, and the man is Sir J.M. Barrie, who wrote his famous play after falling under the spell of a widow and her four young boys. That Barrie was married at the time, that he all but ignored his wife, that he all but moved into the widow's home, that his interest in the boys raised little suspicion, would make this story play very differently today. Johnny Depp's performance makes Barrie not only believable, but acceptable. And he does it without evading the implications of his behavior: The movie doesn't inoculate Barrie as a ""family friend,"" but shows him truly and deeply in love with the widow and her boys, although in an asexual way; we wonder, indeed, if this man has ever had sex, or ever wants to.The movie opens in 1903 in a London theater where Barrie, a Scottish playwright, has seen his latest play turn into a disaster. He needs something new, and quickly, because his impresario (Dustin Hoffman) has a lease on the house and needs to keep it filled. In Kensington Gardens, Barrie happens upon the Davies family: the mother, Sylvia (Kate Winslet), and her boys Peter, George, Jack and Michael. As he watches them at play, a kind of spiritual hunger begins to glow in his eyes. They represent an innocence and purity that strikes him so powerfully he's unable to think of anything else.He becomes friendly with the family. Sylvia has recently become widowed and is not interested in a new romance, but then, curiously, nothing about Barrie's behavior suggests he's attracted to her in that way. He idealizes her, he obsesses about her boys, and when he talks about his own unhappy childhood we get a glimpse of his motivation; when his older brother died, his parents started calling him by the brother's name, and perhaps he felt he lived his brother's childhood and never had his own.He plays games with the boys. He wrestles with a big stuffed bear. He leads them in games involving pirates and cowboys and Indians. He dresses in funny costumes. The children like him and Sylvia is grateful for his attention, especially since she has developed an alarming cough and he helps take care of the boys. The only holdout is Peter, played by Freddie Highmore in a remarkableperformance; if Barrie never grew up, Peter was perhaps never a child. He is wise and solemn, feels the loss of his father more sharply than his brothers, and boldly tells Barrie: ""You're not my father."" Nor does Barrie want to be; he wants to be his brother. Sylvia's condition worsens, and when the boys stage a play in thefamily garden, it's cut short by her coughing. The boys are reassured that nothing serious is wrong, but Peter is sure they're lying to him about her illness: ""I won't be made a fool!""Two other women regard this situation with alarm. Barrie's wife Mary (Radha Mitchell) rarely sees him at home and is understandably disturbed about his relationship with the Davies family, although she is not as angry as she might be; there is the implication that she has long since given up on expecting rational behavior from her husband. He lives in a dream world, and to some degree she understands that. Not as sympathetic is Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie), Sylvia's mother, who as the widow of the famous George du Maurier moved in sophisticated circles and is not amused by a 43-year-old man who wants to become the best playmate of her grandchildren.It is Barrie's innocence, or naivete, or perhaps even a kind of rapture, impervious to common sense, that steers him past all obstacles as he begins to form the idea of ""Peter Pan"" in his mind. The boys are his muses. He tries to explain his new play to his impresario, who has just closed one flop, doesn't want to open another, and is less than thrilled about a play involving fairies, pirates, and children who can fly. Depp in his scenes shows Barrie in the grip of a holy zeal, his mind operating on a private, almost trance-like level, as the play comes into focus for him. He knows, if nobody else does, that he is creating a myth that will powerfully involve children. His masterstroke is to invite 25 orphans to the play's opening night and scatter them through the audience, where their laugher and delight stirs the adults to see the magic in the play.For Depp, ""Finding Neverland"" is the latest in an extraordinary series of performances. After his Oscar nomination for ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" (2003), here is another role that seems destined for nomination. And then think of his work in ""Secret Window"" (2004), the Stephen King story about the author caught in a nightmare, and his demented CIA agent in ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" (2003), and wait until you see him in ""The Libertine,"" as the depraved and shameless Earl of Rochester. That the flamboyance of his pirate and the debauchery of the Earl could exist in the same actor as the soft-spoken, gentle, inward J.M. Barrie is remarkable. It is commonplace for actors to play widely differing roles, but Depp never makes it feel like a reach; all of these notes seem well within his range.""Finding Neverland"" is, finally, surprisingly moving. The screenplay by David Magee (based on Allan Knee's play) and the direction of Marc Forster (""Monster's Ball"") manipulate the facts to get their effect; Sylvia's husband was still alive in the original story, for example, and her illness had not taken hold. But by compressing events, the movie creates for the Barrie character an opportunity for unconditional love. What he feels for the Davies family is disinterested and pure, despite all the appearances. What he feels for his wife remains a mystery, not least to her.",4,surprisingly moving,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,5732,"['Finding', 'Neverland', 'story', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'grow',

880087,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0007CNXUK,Roland E. Zwick,"[8, 9]","Johnny Depp gives one of his most subtle performances to date in ""Finding Neverland,"" a film about the creative process that has a thing or two to say about the part imagination plays in all our lives.  In this adaptation of the play by Allan Knee, Depp plays J.M. Barrie, the author who, in 1904, introduced the world to Peter Pan.  According to the movie (though not necessarily reality), Barrie gleaned the inspiration for his creation from a beautiful young widow and her four sons whom he met one day in the park and with whom he forged a deep and lasting relationship (there are a few factual errors in that synopsis, but in the interest of keeping your confusion to a minimum, I`ll recount the story as the movie presents it).  In his endeavors to entertain the children, Barrie brought them into his world of magical make believe, eventually weaving the story of Peter Pan out of those experiences.When we first meet Barrie, he is already a well-known and successful playwright in the London theater world - although his latest work has bored his audience and critics so thoroughly in its premiere performance that it is forced to close on opening night.  Suffering from creative stagnation and stuck in a stifling marriage, Barrie eventually finds surcease and an outlet for his creativity with his new-found ""family"" from the park.  However, even though the film technically takes place in the Edwardian Era, the iron hand of Victorian Era morality still holds England in its icy grip.  For soon rumors are flying not only about the ""unseemly"" relationship between Barrie and Mrs. Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, but even about the questionable and potentially sinister nature of Barrie's relationship with the boys.Written by David Magee and directed by Marc Foster, ""Finding Neverland"" offers a touching, fascinating glimpse into the mind of a man in the process of creating one of the most enduring tales of modern literature.  One of the marks of any ""classic"" work of inspiration - be it art, music, literature or drama - is that we are never aware of the nuts-and-bolts process that has gone into its creation.  The greater the work, the more we are inclined to believe that it dropped fully formed from heaven, a rare gift from the gods that seems somehow always to have existed somewhere.  That is certainly the case with ""Peter Pan,""  which is why ""Finding Neverland"" provides such an invaluable service.  It forces us to acknowledge that even the greatest of creations, which we tend to attribute to that mysterious and intangible entity known as ""genius,"" are really the product of one part inspiration to two  parts fortuitous timing and hard work.  ""Finding Neverland"" flows effortlessly between the events as they happened in real life and the fantasy scenarios that Barrie eventually wove out of them to create his masterpiece.  As a result, the movie itself has a kind of heightened fairy tale feel to it that works well in the context of the story.  The movie also affords us an entertaining behind-the-scenes view of the creation of the play itself and a breathless recreation of its opening night.In addition to Depp, the film is filled with fine performances by Kate Winslet as Sylvia, Julie Christie as her stern, disapproving mother, Dustin Hoffman as Barrie's sympathetic theater manager, and Radha Mitchell, as Barrie's cold, status-conscious wife.  The four young actors who play the boys are also excellent, with Freddie Highmore, as the precocious and too-cynical-for-his-own-good Peter, a particular standout.Historians may find room to quibble about some of the liberties the film takes with the facts.  Sylvia was not a widow at the time of the story and her husband resented the intrusion of Barrie into their lives.  Even one of the sons has been dropped.  This is acceptable, however, since an over-cluttered plot would likely have robbed the film of the simplicity it needs to sustain its fairy tale ambiance.  Moreover, the movie telescopes a number of key events to enhance their dramatic impact (i.e. his wife's affair with writer Gilbert Cannan, which is shown as being a contemporaneous event, actually occurred a number of years after this part of the story).  But such nitpicking seems fruitless in the overall scheme of the film.Was Peter Llewelyn Davies the real inspiration for Peter Pan or was it J.M. Barrie himself?  The film doesn't answer that question, but it certainly hints at the distinct possibility of the latter.  For Barrie was clearly a man who much preferred the warm fantasies of carefree childhood to the cold cynicism of responsible adulthood.

And then there are those rare films that seem to have it all.This movie has it all.From amazing performances, to believable and likeable characters, to a fascinating, original storyline, to laughter and tears, Finding Neverland does not disappoint on any level.Johnny Depp is truly amazing.  There is no other actor who can create original characters and make them multidimensional the way Depp can.  Depp's Barrie is a shy, sensitive, creative genius filled with warmth and humor. I can't imagine any other actor who could play Barrie with that kind of believability.  Pitt?  Too shallow and untested.  Cruise?  Too self-involved.  Crowe?  Too rough around the edges.  (Pay attention during the parlor scene in Sylvia's house when James relates to Sylvia the story of his mother after the death of James's brother.  He has never spoken of his unique fantasy--Neverland--to anyone before this, he tells her.  Depp's delivery is remarkable.  Watch the subtle movements in his expression.  The eyes, the shy smile.  Incredible.)And Kate Winslet puts in an outstanding performance as Sylvia, a woman who has her priorities in the right places.  She made me want to go home, trade my PC for Play-Doh and spend my time with my kids.Although I don't think Depp and Winslet are an obvious couple, and there's never anything physical between Sylvia and James, the depth of love shown by these characters is obvious and genuine. Once again, it would be hard to picture other actors in their places.Freddie Highmore's performance as Peter is garnering all the attention, and rightfully so, but all the boys are extraordinary.  They are so convincing that it is hard to believe these boys are from the present century.  There's not a one who doesn't represent his character as if he were in fact a Llewellyn Davies.The scenery and the music also evoke another, more innocent era, strengthening the mood of the film.Even the fringe characters--Radha Mitchell as cold Mary Barrie, Dustin Hoffman as James's dry-humored business manager, and Julie Christie as Sylvia's stern, protective mother--hit the mark.And director Marc Forster was robbed of an opportunity to win an Oscar, having not even been nominated.

880091,A387BD735MI50R,B0007CNXUK,R. Schultz,"[1, 3]","This is a lushly photographed, but ultimately rather flat film. Although it has a lot of star power, most of its popular actors fail to shine. Dustin Hoffman actually manages to be uninteresting as the long-suffering Producer of James Barrie's plays. Kate Winslet comes off as the somewhat conventional, dreary mother of a host of boys. Only one of these boys is allowed enough screen time to become a distinct character. Julie Christie appears as a one-dimensional harpy for most of the length of the film. Johnny Depp himself seems rather languorously abstracted into the fantasy world he periodically occupies with the boys.Part of the reason for the actors' failure to give spark to their characters - might be that perennial pressure Directors are now under to maintain pacing. There is a Director's Commentary on this DVD, which is itself somewhat flat, but still probably worth listening to if you have the time. In this Commentary, Marc Forster tells how much of author James Barrie's biography he was compelled to cut in the interests of ""keeping things moving."" Some of the omissions he alludes to might make viewers wish that, instead of this movie, they had attended a performance of the ""Lost Boys"" play from which parts of ""Finding Neverland"" are loosely adapted.For example, Depp (as Barrie) is seen briefly chatting with a man on the sidelines of a cricket game. The scene will probably completely fail to register with most viewers. But then the Director tells us that this fleeting exchange actually was the ten-second glimpse the film afforded into the abiding friendship between Barrie and Arthur Conan Doyle, inventor of Sherlock Holmes and himself a dedicated researcher into the mostly imaginary worlds beyond the veil. The scene would have been much more interesting if it had been given more time and detail. That's true of so many scenes.Then the details that the Director did labor to include don't seem to count much. He points out how he would present two subtly different views of a setting or a character's dress. First we see Julie Christie's dress as it really is, Then when we turn back and see it again, it has changed ever so slightly, to reflect Barrie's heightened, imaginative view of it. However these changes are in fact so subtle, that it's doubtful they are registering, even subliminally, on most of us. It might have been more effective, more moving -  to just dwell on and flesh out the initial reality of the various scenes.However, my somewhat dimmer view of the movie might just be a reflection of my lifelong indifference to the story of Peter Pan. As much as I like many of Barrie's other plays and stories, I was always left relatively cold, even as a child, by the play's philosophy - by its longing after the stasis of an eternal youth and by its early pop psychology purveyance of the idea that if you just believe - you can make it true. So the movie's lack of appeal for me might just be the result of the jaundiced view I've taken of the Peter Pan principle in general. Maybe those who really can believe in faeries - will find this a wonderland of a movie.",3,Doesn't Fly,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,3115,"['lushly', 'photographed', 'ultimately', 'rather', 'flat', 'film', 'lot', 'star', 'power', 'most', 'popular', 'actors', 'fail', 'shine', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'actually', 'be', 'uninteresting', 'long-suffering', 'Producer', 'James', 'Barrie', 'plays', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'off', 'somewhat', 'conventional', 'dreary', 'mother', 'host', 'boys', 'Only', 'one', 'boys', 'allowed', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'become', 'distinct', 'character', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'one-dimensional', 'harpy', 'most', 'length', 'film', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'rather', 'languorously', 'abstracted', 'fantasy', 'world', 'periodically', 'boys.Part', 'reason', 'actors', 'failure', 'give', 'spark', 'characters', 'might', 'be', 'perennial', 'pressure', 'Directors', 'are', 'now', 'maintain', 'pacing', 'Director', 'Commentary', 'DVD', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'still', 'probably', 'worth', 'listening', 'have', 'time', 'Commentary', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'how', 'much', 'author', 'James', 'Barrie', 'biography', 'was', 'compelled', 'cut', 'interests', 'keeping', 'things', 'moving', 'omissions', 'might', 'make', 'viewers', 'wish', 'instead', 'movie', 'had', 'attended', 'performance', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'play', 'parts', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'are', 'loosely', 'adapted.For', 'example', 'Depp', 'Barrie', 'seen', 'briefly', 'chatting', 'man', 'sidelines', 'cricket', 'game', 'scene', 'will', 'probably', 'completely', 'fail', 'register', 'most', 'viewers', 'then', 'Director', 'fleeting', 'exchange', 'actually', 'was', 'ten-second', 'glimpse', 'film', 'afforded', 'abiding', 'friendship', 'Barrie', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'inventor', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'dedicated', 'researcher', 'mostly', 'imaginary', 'worlds', 'veil', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'time', 'detail', 'true', 'so', 'many', 'scenes.Then', 'details', 'Director', 'did', 'labor', 'include', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'count', 'much', 'out', 'how', 'would', 'present', 'two', 'subtly', 'different', 'views', 'setting', 'character', 'dress', 'First', 'see', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'dress', 'really', 'Then', 'when', 'turn', 'back', 'see', 'again', 'changed', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'reflect', 'Barrie', 'heightened', 'imaginative', 'view', 'However', 'changes', 'are', 'fact', 'so', 'subtle', 'doubtful', 'are', 'registering', 'even', 'subliminally', 'most', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'more', 'moving', 'just', 'dwell', 'flesh', 'out', 'initial', 'reality', 'various', 'scenes.However', 'somewhat', 'dimmer', 'view', 'movie', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'reflection', 'lifelong', 'indifference', 'story', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'As', 'much', 'like', 'many', 'Barrie', 'other', 'plays', 'stories', 'was', 'always', 'left', 'relatively', 'cold', 'even', 'child', 'play', 'philosophy', 'longing', 'stasis', 'eternal', 'youth', 'early', 'pop', 'psychology', 'purveyance', 'idea', 'just', 'believe', 'can', 'make', 'true', 'movie', 'lack', 'appeal', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'result', 'jaundiced', 'view', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'principle', 'general', 'Maybe', 'who', 'really', 'can', 'believe', 'faeries', 'will', 'find', 'wonderland', 'movie']",Finding Neverland

880096,AQM2ADBR0TYSO,B0007CNXUK,Sarah Schenkkan,"[2, 2]","I saw this film at a sneak preview last Thursday night, and was utterly enthralled with it from start to finish. Johnny Depp shines in one of the best performances of his career as J.M. Barrie, a Scottish playwright, who after coming off of his last poorly reviewed play, struggles for inspiration. And this he finds, in the minds and hearts of the Lywellyn-Davies family, a widowed Sylvia Lywellyn-Davies, and her four young boys, whom he meets by chance in a nearby park. The children are immediately enthralled by Barrie's childlike manner and his wild imagination, (Barrie equally so) and he soon becomes a prominent figure in their lives, and the life of Sylvia, much to the gossip of the town, and the dismay of Barrie's wife, Mary. From his relationship with this family, Barrie soon begins to write the play that would remain a classic forever, ""Peter Pan"".One of the things I liked best about this film are the performances, which are incredible. Johnny Depp, who has been named an Oscar contender for Best Actor, is perfect in the role of the quirky and imaginative Barrie. As Sylvia, Kate Winslet is astounding, and the supporting cast of Dustin Hoffman, Julie Christie, and Radha Mitchell are a pleasure to watch. However, the performance that truly blew me away in ""Finding Neverland"" was that of Freddie Highmore. At the mere age of twelve, he seems to embody innocence, and is captivating and moving as Sylvia's youngest son, Peter. Keep an eye on this young man, he can next be seen in another beloved tale, ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" as Charlie Bucket.The world of J.M.

880098,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0007CNXUK,Scott Schiefelbein,"[3, 4]","Marc Forster's ""Finding Neverland"" is the best tale of artistic inspiration since ""Amadeus.""  In that amazing film about Mozart, some of the most enjoyable scenes focused on how Mozart could find inspiration for a musical composition in the dribble composed by a rival, or even in the shrieking of his mother-in-law.  ""Amadeus"" left you bewildered at the scope of Mozart's genius.""Finding Neverland"" shows the inspiration of a talented author that comes from a different source -- love and lost innocence.  The author, J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp, once again magnificent), is trapped both in a loveless marriage and by the social mores of 1903 England.  His latest play is a flop, and his curmudgeonly backer, Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman, redeeming himself for the disastrous ""Hook""), is dropping ominous hints about Barrie's future.And then, lo and behold, Barrie stumbles across the Widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four little boys.  Instantly tapping into the active imaginations of these kids, Barrie is soon playing pirates, or cowboys and Indians, or any number of games involving imagination with the tykes.  Out of these games, and also thanks to the harsh discipline vainly imposed by the Sylvia's mother Emma (Julie Christie), the classic tale of ""Peter Pan"" is born.""Finding Neverland"" skirts cheap manipulation but always stays on the side of effective restraint.  Watch for several tear-jerker scenes, especially the perfect choice Barrie makes to ensure on ""Peter Pan's"" opening night that the older theater audience ""gets"" the play.  But the cast never goes over the top, and this saves the movie.And while each of the kids in the movie provides performances ranging from good to great, special mention has to be made for Freddie Highmore as Peter.  This little guy is freakishly good, and says more with a glance than many adult actors can do with a rambling speech.A heck of a family film that never descends into mawkishness, ""Finding Neverland,"" like ""Peter Pan,"" has several delights that are worth (and include) a few tears along the way.

880099,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B0007CNXUK,Sebastian Fernandez,"[0, 0]","A couple of times in my lifetime I have come across a movie that seemed filmed especially for me. As most of you can imagine, I experience great joy when this happens, and ""Finding Neverland"" spoke to me in a very special way and therefore, generated this very special feeling. People say that everyone has a child inside that is eager to come out, and that adults are constantly fighting this desire keeping it in check. Even though I am thirty years old, I feel this way at least a couple of times a day, so watching Depp in the role of James Barrie was touching and marvelous.The movie tells the story of how Mr. Barrie created the magnificent play ""Peter Pan"", and we get to see the events that inspired him and allowed him to free his inner child. The setting is London 1903, where we find Barrie presenting his last play, which is plain and unsatisfying. He is eager to do better, but does not have a muse, which in part is the result of the attitude of his wife Sarah. She is distant, formal, and is interested in posing as an upper class family and showing a proper behavior, more than in sharing moments with her husband.James usually goes to the park to write while allowing his dog, a beautiful Newfoundland, to wander around. This is how he meets his muses, Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her four boys, Michael, George, Jack, and...Peter. From that point forward he starts to get involved in playing with the kids and in sharing their fantasies, without caring about what others think of this. Sylvia is a widow, and the boys have suffered greatly by the loss of their father, especially Peter. But through perseverance and kindness, James starts building a beautiful relationship with them and having an effect on their lives.There are so many messages in this movie that it would be impossible to enumerate them. This is one of the reasons why I think that this is a film that can be watched over and over again without losing its appeal. But besides the great script, there is also the high-level performances of Depp and Winslet, who fit their roles to perfection and provide their characters with a realism seldom seen. The kids are also great in their performances, especially Freddie Highmore playing Peter, since he presents the emotions of the character with great conviction. To top it off, the music is absolutely delightful. I guess that by this point, you have a pretty good idea: this is a movie that you cannot afford to miss!",5,"""I think I can do better""",1112659200,"04 5, 2005",2005,2449,"['couple', 'times', 'lifetime', 'have', 'come', 'movie', 'seemed', 'filmed', 'especially', 'most', 'can', 'imagine', 'experience', 'great', 'joy', 'when', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'spoke', 'very', 'special', 'way', 'therefore', 'generated', 'very', 'special', 'feeling', 'People', 'say', 'everyone', 'child', 'eager', 'come', 'out', 'adults', 'are', 'constantly', 'fighting', 'desire', 'keeping', 'check', 'Even', 'am', 'thirty', 'years', 'old', 'feel', 'way', 'least', 'couple', 'times', 'day', 'so', 'watching', 'Depp', 'role', 'James', 'Barrie', 'was', 'touching', 'marvelous.The', 'movie', 'story', 'how', 'Mr.', 'Barrie', 'created', 'magnificent', 'play', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'get', 'see', 'events', 'inspired', 'allowed', 'free', 'inner', 'child', 'setting', 'London', '1903', 'where', 'find', 'Barrie', 'presenting', 'last', 'play', 'plain', 'unsatisfying', 'eager', 'do', 'better', 'not', 'have', 'muse', 'part', 'result', 'attitude', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'distant', 'formal', 'interested', 'posing', 'upper', 'class', 'family', 'showing', 'proper', 'behavior', 'more', 'sharing', 'moments', 'husband.James', 'usually', 'park', 'write', 'allowing', 'dog', 'beautiful', 'Newfoundland', 'wander', 'around', 'how', 'muses', 'Sylvia', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'four', 'boys', 'Michael', 'George', 'Jack', 'Peter', 'point', 'forward', 'get', 'involved', 'playing', 'kids', 'sharing', 'fantasies', 'caring', 'what', 'others', 'think', 'Sylvia', 'widow', 'boys', 'have', 'suffered', 'greatly', 'loss', 'father', 'especially', 'Peter', 'perseverance', 'kindness', 'James', 'building', 'beautiful', 'relationship', 'having', 'effect', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'messages', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'enumerate', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'think', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'losing', 'appeal', 'great', 'script', 'also', 'high-level', 'performances', 'Depp', 'Winslet', 'who', 'fit', 'roles', 'perfection', 'provide', 'characters', 'realism', 'seldom', 'seen', 'kids', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'performances', 'especially', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'playing', 'Peter', 'emotions', 'character', 'great', 'conviction', 'top', 'off', 'music', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'guess', 'point', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'miss']",Finding Neverland

880103,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B0007CNXUK,Shashank Tripathi,"[3, 4]","It is not easy to gripe about a sweetly sentimental film that deals un-mawkishly with a theme as mawkish as this, but if you've seen the recent Ewan McGregor starrer 'Big Fish,' you may find Neverland wanting in luster. But I'm putting the horse before the cart, plus that's not the point.Several glowing tributes in major publications had me convinced that Neverland was a biopic of JM Barrie, the creator of Peter Pan. In reality the film is not smitten one bit with the misery of historical precision - google for Barrie and you'll see even his looks were a world apart from a very comely Johnny Depp.It is more a silver-tongued ode to the magic of imagination, to the pursuit of a joy in art that's elusive in the Real World, to the value of retaining a childlike wonder while acquiring a mature understanding of the world.On all of those levels, it eclipsed my expectations. Even if we were to discount Peter Pan and think of Barrie as just an obscure, failed writer, this heartfelt film would still enchant with equal intensity.The screenplay glides between full-blown fantasy sequences to reveal the fertility of Barrie's brain while keeping us grounded in reality. If Big Fish and Neverland were put belly to belly, I suspect that the former would have an edge, but Neverland's set up of its context is fluent and fascinating while sporting some old Edwardian restraint.Johnny Depp is probably one of the finest actors around, I marvel at his ability to find poetry in his character while turning in a measured presence with a very unobstrusive Scottish accent. He even looks about 15 years younger than his real age. I've never seen Kate Winslet as maternal as this but she's luminous nonetheless. An egging romantic subplot is tossed between the two, always platonic on the surface but not without a tinge of intrigue if you pay attention to those prolonged glances.Hoffman has an embarrasingly marginal role, so if you're expecting some histrionics from him, don't. It is unclear why he's doing this -- Lemony Snicket has a painfully trivial appearance from him too.The true stars of the show however are the four young boys, especially Freddie Highmore who plays the cynical child to whom ""Peter"" Pan was dedicated.There will understandably be some quibbles with this film. Perhaps the scope is too modest -- we barely begin to enjoy Barrie's consummation of his fantasties when all of it comes to an abrupt end. Or perhaps, especially in hindsight, it all feels like we stepped on the sob pedal too hard, which is not helped by some pat dialgue about, gulp, 'believe in it'.If you come away from this film with such a Scrooge-like perspective, it's ironically a good sign that you need a ticket to Neverland yourself.It's a well-done, moving film. I enjoyed my time in the theatre. Pack your Kleenex, keep your quixotic horses saddled, and soon, like the audience in the film itself, you'll find yourself wondering if we ever really let go of that child in ourselves.

For the Llewen-Davies boys, times have been very tough, with the death of their father, and the pitiful financial state that has left the family in.  Times are tough, indeed, and they are about to get tougher, with the degenerating health of their mother, beautifully played by Kate Winslet.But the Davies boys are about to get some relief from their hard-knock lives in the form of J.M. Barrie, a playwright who is having hard times of his own.  Johnny Depp plays Barrie as a champion of youthfull spirit, but also with the realism of an adult fully aware of the problems he has been ignoring for some time.  Barrie's marriage is on the rocks.  He and his wife (Radha Mitchell) do not share the same bed, nor do they share much about their own lives with one another.  There are a few key moments that expose that these two people were in love once, though that has long since passed, and the loss of that love is in some way a tragedy.  A scene where they say their final goodbye at the premier of ""Peter Pan"" is touching and tragic, and the audience finally gets the view of the marriage that could have been if...Barrie spends all of his time with the Davies boys and their mother (though in a platonic relationship) and teaches them to pretend.  IN the meantime, they give him the inspiration he needs for his masterwork.  He never uses the boys for inspiration, though.  His relationship with them is one of love (fatherly love, as is his relationship with their mother.  When he communicates to Sylvia (Winslet) about love it is both vague, and far too late for any romantic attachment.  Reality once again sets in, and Barrie must teach the boys and their mother that they must not pretend all of the time.  They must deal with what is at hand, but with the powers of their collective imagination, their family can last a lifetime.The final scene involves Barrie and Peter talking on a bench.  Peter is one of the middle children in the Davies family, and is played with such maturity and emotion by Freddie Highmore that you wonder how much depth someone that young could really have.  ""Finding Neverland"" is about just that, finding the place you can escape reality and deal with it all at once.  It is a beatiful film that may be a little sweet, and it certainly skirts the issues surrounding Barrie's relationship with both the boys and their mother.  Barrie is depicted as near saintly here, but the result is something wonderful nonetheless.

The movie is loosely based on the life of J.M. Barrie, the writer of the `Peter Pan' story. The writers of the movie manipulated the facts to get a warm fuzzy effect of the movie that I guess is supposed to leave you feeling inspired, though it didn't with me.Basically, the plot is rather mediocre. To sum up, Barrie meets a widowed woman and her son's in the park and they develop a friendship. Actually, I would consider Barrie more than just a `family friend'; he takes it a step further in my opinion. However, the writers of the movie made it obvious that their friendship was totally asexual (even with the mother). Essentially, the rest of the movie is him pretend-playing with these boys, thusly getting the inspiration for his famous play, `Peter Pan'. In the middle of this his wife gets annoyed that he's spending so much time with this family and leaves him (who could blame her). I wont say anything else about the plot because I don't want to spoil it, but that's pretty much it in a nut shell. The concept of the story is great; triumph of art, creativity, and playfulness over snootiness and growing-up.  However, I feel it was poorly executed in the movie. The acting and the visuals were pretty good, but the plot seriously lacked momentum.On a side note, it's funny how the movie completely mirrors Michael Jackson. You have a man who, for some reason, has this need to fill a void in his life by pretend-playing with young boys. This man completely refuses to `grow-up' and take on the normal responsibilities of adulthood such as tending to relationships and commitments.This movie is good for a rental.

While looking for inspiration for his next venture, he meets Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four sons.  There is an instant rapport between Barrie and the young men.  As he spends more time with them, Barrie's imagination is stimulated and he begins to develop a new work entitled ""Peter Pan.""  However, the vast amount of time he spends with the boys and their mother strains his relationship with his wife, Mary (Radha Mitchell) and raises the ire of Sylvia's mother, Mrs. Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie).The manner in which ""Finding Neverland"" blends fantasy and reality is befitting for a film about the author of ""Peter Pan.""  Yet the main reason for the film's success is due to its collection of outstanding performances.  Depp is outstanding and Winslet ably compliments him with a very strong turn of her own.  In addition, Freddie Highmore, Nick Roud, Joe Prospero, and Luke Spill are great as the young boys.  Mitchell, Christie, and Dustin Hoffman round things out with strong supporting work.  Yet, ""Finding Neverland"" succeeds mainly because of Depp.  He immerses himself so well in the role of Barrie that it never feels like he is just an actor playing a part.

880120,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B0007CNXUK,Timothy Kearney,"[2, 3]","PETER PAN was never my favorite childhood story. It has come to life in a number of versions on stage and screen, but the story of the boy who never wanted to grow up never appealed to me. Who knows, maybe I need to release my inner child and that is why I react negatively to it. Since I am not the greatest PETER PAN fan, I had no string desire to see FINDING NEVERLAND. I read reviews in the paper, some of which lauded the work, others which gave it less than favorable grades. It was not until a woman in a writing workshop I attended praised the film that my interest was peaked. She said it was something all writers would relate to and it was well done. Since she, like many of the participants of the workshop could tell an interesting story and appreciate a good story as well, I decided I should go see it. I put it off until after it was nominated for various Academy Awards and decided I had to see it before the Oscars.I will not say that FINDING NEVERLAND deserves to receive all of the Oscars that it is the running for, but it does deserve all of the nominations it has received. It is a beautiful film with a riveting story. It tells the story of the writer J.M. Barrie and the relationship he has with the widow Sylvia Llewellyn Davies and her four young sons.  Barrie is in an unhappy marriage and his friendship with Sylvia, as well as his fascination with her sons brings him out of a slump. The relationship resulted in his writing the play PETER PAN. The main focus of the film is the relationship between Barrie, Sylvia, and her sons. Little attention is paid to the marital conflict, nor is undue attention paid to the rumors regarding the friendship of Sylvia and Barrie (e.g. Is it Platonic? Why is he so mesmerized by the boys?). Both situations are mentioned so the viewer is aware that Barrie's world is not Neverland. While some could se this as a glossing over of the conflict in the film, the brief attention speaks powerfully and allows the viewer to be aware of the whole situation, which in turn allows the viewer to see how this family inspired what many consider to be a great work by a genius.The acting is superb. Once again Johnny Depp shows he is a great character actor and Kate Winslet is wonderful as Sylvia. Rahda Mitchell plays Mary Barrie, J.M.'s wife with great skill. She is neither a vixen nor a shrew, which makes the marital difficulties easy to believe. Two of Hollywood's greats, Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman, play supporting roles which are integral to the success of the film. Hoffman is the theatre owner Charles Frohman who produces Barrie's plays and has misgivings about PETER PAN. Julie Christie plays Sylvia's mother Emma du Maurier. Emma is a socialite who appears to be snobby, but we see as the film progresses that it is out of concern for her daughter and grandchildren. Perhaps the characters who have the most emotional pull in the film are the Llewelyn Davies boys George, Jack, Peter, and Michael played by Nick Roud, Joe Prospero, Freddie Highmore, and Luke Spill respectively. While Highmore's Peter is endearing, viewers' hearts go out to Roud's George, who cannot be a Peter Pan like figure when his mother is dying. The setting for the film is beautiful. Early twentieth century England comes to life in a realistic manner, and the props and stage equipment in the theatre are also accurate for the time period. The music is moving and adds an emotional element to the film.So will it get Best Picture? Maybe, but the competition is steep. I would not expect to see Depp receive best actor in place of Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles, though in another year Depp would be a contender for the award. It could easily win awards for art direction, music, adapted screenplay and costume design.

880121,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B0007CNXUK,Traveler,"[17, 19]","""Finding Neverland"" is that rare gem of a movie that takes its audience seriously.  So many of the movies out of Hollywood are geared towards the 16 to 25 year old male perspective.  Action, dumb plot, stupid characters, etc.  ""Neverland"" is a movie that doesn't pander to emotion.  It doesn't show us yet another unnecessary action scene.  And it doesn't make every relationship obsessed with sex.What you get with ""Neverland"" is a movie that takes you to another time and gives you insight into the mind of a great writer and the experiences which influenced him.  It is a patient movie, more interested in creating a tone and place to help us understand the concepts of Neverland, imagination, and reality.While perhaps not the focus of the director (and probably unnoticed by most viewers), ""Neverland"" is also a refreshing depiction of a male character dealing with children.  While Barrie is depicted as being child-like, he is still a grown man with an adult's ability in relating to children.  Far too often we're inundated with media images of the stupid father figure, the doofus, who doesn't have a clue.  With Depp's characterization of Barrie we see a man who can play with children and yet still be an adult.Johnny Depp, almost as matter of course, once again delivers a performance that is all the more amazing given his body of work as a whole.  This the same man who did ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" and a dozen other movies in widely divergent character roles.  And Kate Winslet seems to be only getting better with age, both in ability and beauty.There seems to be a number of reviewers claiming that ""Neverland"" is slow or that it's pretentious.  If you enjoy well made movies you can ignore these comments.  Of course, don't fall prey to the hype, either.  ""Finding Neverland"" might not become your most favorite film, but it is worth both viewing and owning as a DVD.

880122,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B0007CNXUK,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","Finding Neverland is a bit of a charmer that's much better than it has any right to be but not nearly as good as it could have been with a bit more nerve. Whereas The Lost Boys (no, not the vampire one), Andrew Birkin's BBC take on the relationship between J.M. Barrie and the Llewellyn-Davies children who inspired his greatest work, was all sombre darkness and little light, Marc Forster's film could do with a little more shading, and it's a tribute to Johnny Depp's abilities that he manages to avoid turning Barrie into Tinkerbell or, worse, Mrs Doubtfire. His understated charm gives the whimsy wings even when the direction and photography fails to quite convince. It's the smaller moments that really convince - the genuinely touching moment with a widow after the premiere of Peter Pan beautifully touches on the sense of loss that fuelled the play, as does the moment he notices the oldest of the children suddenly growing up.The other players meet with mixed fortunes. Kate Winslett is just Kate Winslett, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, Freddie Highmore impresses as Peter, Dustin Hoffman is reliably worldworn, but Julie Christie's wicked stepmother is always on the brink of parody (but then Christie never was much of an actress). Rhada Mitchell tries hard to avoid turning Mrs Barrie into a heartless stereotype, but the script is so busy celebrating Barrie's free spirit that it only briefly touches on the way he shuts her out of his imagination. The DVD also includes a wonderful in-character out-take of Depp expressing his admiration for the capacity of his dog's bladder that is worth the price of the disc on its own.",4,A charming underachiever,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,1645,"['Finding', 'Neverland', 'bit', 'charmer', 'much', 'better', 'right', 'be', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'nerve', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'not', 'vampire', 'one', 'Andrew', 'Birkin', 'BBC', 'take', 'relationship', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'Llewellyn-Davies', 'children', 'who', 'inspired', 'greatest', 'work', 'was', 'sombre', 'darkness', 'little', 'light', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'film', 'could', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'shading', 'tribute', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'abilities', 'avoid', 'turning', 'Barrie', 'Tinkerbell', 'worse', 'Mrs', 'Doubtfire', 'understated', 'charm', 'whimsy', 'wings', 'even', 'when', 'direction', 'photography', 'fails', 'quite', 'convince', 'smaller', 'moments', 'really', 'convince', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'moment', 'widow', 'premiere', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'beautifully', 'sense', 'loss', 'fuelled', 'play', 'moment', 'oldest', 'children', 'suddenly', 'growing', 'up.The', 'other', 'players', 'meet', 'mixed', 'fortunes', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'just', 'Kate', 'Winslett', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'Peter', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'reliably', 'worldworn', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'wicked', 'stepmother', 'always', 'brink', 'parody', 'then', 'Christie', 'never', 'was', 'much', 'actress', 'Rhada', 'Mitchell', 'hard', 'avoid', 'turning', 'Mrs', 'Barrie', 'heartless', 'stereotype', 'script', 'so', 'busy', 'celebrating', 'Barrie', 'free', 'spirit', 'only', 'touches', 'way', 'imagination', 'DVD', 'also', 'wonderful', 'in-character', 'out-take', 'Depp', 'expressing', 'admiration', 'capacity', 'dog', 'bladder', 'price', 'disc', 'own']",Finding Neverland

Still, his marriage seems distant and he is bothered by the mediocrity of his creative output. On opening night, people complement him on his terrible plays and he knows they are just trying to be nice.One day while sitting on a park bench, he encounters three adolescent boys, who he quickly befriends. He invites them over for dinner and also solidifies a friendship with their mother, played by Kate Winslet, much to the disappointment of his wife and her mother, the stern, protective Julie Christie. The boy's father died from cancer and to some extent, his becomes their playmate, without trying to replace their dad. At the same time, his wife becomes increasingly disenchanted that her husband is spending so much time with another woman and her children.As his friendship grows with the boys and her mother, he begins to develop a play, loosely based about them. While initially met with skepticism in the planning stages, the play ends up becoming Barrie's most famous creation.While less visually fantastic than last year's Big Fish by Tim Burton, Finding Neverland has its own tastefully limited special effects, but it outshines Burton's film in its amount of sheer heart.I actually ended up seeing this film since I arrived too late for the film I originally wanted to see. At the end of Finding Neverland, I was not even slightly surprised to see the audience burst into applause. It was also nice to see that the film was sold out.The acting is well done without being spectacular. I enjoyed Johnny Depp's performance, but he didn't play the role with an extraordinary amount of charisma. Some people will see this as a failing, but I think a genuine performance is better than glitzy but shallow one. One of the children is particularly strong, playing the role of Peter.

880126,A5CWLQF6QO3CN,B0007CNXUK,"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B...","[2, 2]","Finding Neverland is the story about how Sir James Barrie inspired by a widowed family and wrote the all time classics Peter Pan.James (Johnny Depp) was having a serious writer block and his last work flopped badly. He was in need of inspiration and his marriage was on the rocks. Fate brought him to meet the widowed family of Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet), whose deceased husband left her 4 boys on her own. Through interactions with the boys, each having their own character, James weaved together a masterpiece that originally was thought of insane, but then turned to be the classic that everyone now still reads and enjoys.Johnny Depp gave a spectacular performance again as James Barrie. Not that he put on an accent for the role, but the way he re-created James Barrie as a living character again. The struggle he exhibited for his career, the way how he wanted to solve the marriage problem and yet tried to avoid it, the straight innocence and purity for his care of the boys, and his crazy and imaginative way of telling his stories. Johnny Depp handled every single aspect of the character with a magic touch and yet you could see any side of his character fell apart from the main body. The scenes in which he told Sylvia his childhood secret. and the last scene with Peter were just so well done that you just got drawn into the world of James Barrie and felt that you were there.Kate Winslet as Syvia Davies gave a good turn of her character choice compared to her other movies. She re-lived the life of a woman who contributed her life for her 4 sons. She was worn out by life, she was living through grief, and yet she still wanted to believe that imagination could be solution to problems. You could feel her pain inside her glances from time to time. The character choice was great.The supporting cast was also great. Nick Roud who played George and Freddie Highmore who played Peter were two of the more outstanding ones in terms of performance opportunities. Both were boys who were forced to grow up because of the mishappening at home, but deep inside they wish they could still live a life as a boy of their parents. They are the muse for James and thus eventually named the main character in his play after Peter.Finding Neverland is about the retention of childhood, imagination and creativity in the grown up world. It is the desire to remind the audience about, what matters inside your mind and make believe is the energy of life, no matter what the situation is. This is why James Barrie reserved seats for a group of kids on the opening night, despite the opposition of the theatre manager. It was only through the laughter of the kids that, the audience felt relax and could actually enjoy the imagination and creativity provided by the Neverland.The movie itself has quite a bit of sad elements in it, however, because of what we saw the characters were trying to do, even after weeping (yeah you could hear people weeping in the cinema) you would still feel very good about the movie. The subtle positive energy delivered by the movie would make you to remember it, feel it and appreciate it. The soundtrack accompanying the movie is also marvellous. The tune just fit perfectly into the world of the movie and helped carry the emotion to the audience vividly.Finding Neverland could easily be one of the best movies of the year, without shedding blood, cutting limbs, or any 100 million dollar special effect. In fact, just looking at how older day's theatre tried to expand their imagination on their stage design is already a pleasure.

880127,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0007CNXUK,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 4]","Johnny Depp, dead cert for Oscar nomination of 2005, plays J. M. Barrie, the creator of Peter Pan.  'Finding Neverland' is largely based on the real-life events surrounding the man and the four boys and a widow who inspired the writer to give birth to one of the world's most beloved character, and how the friendship between them gave the magical inspiration to the writer.  And the film has that magical quality too.After the critical disaster of the stage production (which was also a financial disaster to his patron Charles Frohman played by Dustin Hoffman) J. M. Barrie meets the boys and their mother in the park while walking his dog.  The widowed lady is Sylvia Davies (equally superb Kate Winslet), to whom Barrie is attracted despite the existence of his neglected wife Mary (Radha Mitchell).  In this curious but still interesting way, the magical creation of Peter Pan started.While Barrie comes to be an unofficial member of Sylvia's family, we realize that there is too much innocence on the side of Barrie, who can see that imagination is a great thing when playing with the kids yelling like pirates in the garden, but who cannot see that he (and Sylvia) is violating the social mores of English middle-class.  Nor can he understand the broken heart of his own wife.The film takes great liberty with the biographical facts, so don't believe that eveything depicted here is historically accurate.  The story is too neat, with the events compressed within 100 minutes.  And some characters -- such as Ian Hart as Conan Doyle or Julie Christie as Mrs. Emma DuMaurier -- should be given more substantial or complex roles.But Johhny Depp gives accomplished portrait as Barrie who refused to see certain things in life, and created the character who refuses to grow up, with very warm and tender touch.  Frankly, I find his Scottish accent slightly annoying, and Barrie's naivete that could be more harmful to the Sylvia's family is toned down to make his personality and the film itself more accessable.

880128,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0007CNXUK,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 2]","FINDING NEVERLAND is a short biopic about author J.M. Barrie and how he came to write the play PETER PAN, which has gone on to become one of the most famous works of theatre and children's literature ever. The movie opens as Barrie watches his latest play being performed, displaying his anxiety. The play is a flop. From there the movie goes on to show Barrie's first meeting of the Llewelyn-Davies family, how he became friends with the family, the estrangement and eventual divorce from his wife, and how the Llewelyn Davies children inspired the creation of PETER PAN.Johnny Depp portrays Barrie. As is usually the case, Depp is in excellent form and is well deserving of the Oscar nomination he received. Kate Winslet plays the widowed and dying Sylvia Llewelyn Davies. Winslet has had a career of hits and misses. Her performance in FINDING NEVERLAND is one of her better performances, displaying a full range of her skills, rather than just typecasting her as a beautiful young romantic or as a naked crazy woman (or as the case in TITANIC the beautiful young naked woman). Dustin Hoffman has a supporting role in the film as does Ian Hart. However, it is the performance of Freddie Highmore as Peter Llewelyn Davies that is most outstanding. Highmore's performance is remarkable and is just as extraordinary as Haley Joel Osment in THE SIXTH SENSE. It's a shame that Highmore didn't gain an Oscar nomination (though he did become friends with Depp-who he shares a birthday with-and Depp had him cast as Charlie Bucket in the upcoming Tim Burton version of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY).FINDING NEVERLAND is a touching film that doesn't degrade itself to schmaltz. The film plays with certain details of Barrie's life to make the movie more dramatic (for example, Arthur Llewelyn Davies was still alive when Barrie first met his family; there were five sons instead of four). Still, it does a great job at showing how Barrie's experiences with the Llewelyn Davies inspired the creation of Peter Pan. Most of the time the film also shies away from the mushy sentimentality that so many other films of similar type succumb to.

880133,A2KU5PG32H7QBN,B0007CNXUK,"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic""","[1, 2]","'Finding Neverland' is a fictionalized account of play-write J.M. Barrie's inspirations that would result in possibly his most famous work, 'Peter Pan.'  This inspiration is the Llewelyn Davies family, composed of the widowed Sylvia (Kate Winslet), her cynical mother (Julie Christie), and her four boys, including the ""young adult"" Peter (Freddie Highmore), increasingly apathetic and depressed following his father's death.  The story is one of magic, as is the film.  However, despite the opportunity for more interesting subject matter, director Mark Forster's new film feels quite processed; one can tell the cheese-loving Miramax produces.  There are no difficulties, nothing challenges the audience; even the performances given by an appropriately softened Depp and the disappointingly plain (it's not like she was given much to work with) Kate Winslet seem to settle at one horizon and cease to expand upon their respective characters or develop nuance.  But despite its short-comings, 'Finding Neverland' is an often-times endearing piece of work, proving perfect in production value; there are even delicious supporting roles that seem to exist only to spice up the screen with the likes of Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman, both doing well with small, underwritten roles.  The highlight of the film, though, is young Freddie Highmore, who, despite his young age, manages to fully emote and elicit honest emotional response (in a key break-down scene, Highmore nearly had me in tears).  He, among other reasons, will draw many to the film (I expect 'Neverland' to rank high on weekend box office charts).  Mark Forster sets the film at a generously even pace, so 'Neverland' will keep its audience awake.  But the screenplay falls short of making its themes of imagination vs. cynicism entirely convincing, as there is lack of character development throughout, and many adults herein feel much too black-and-white during a rather quick group transition from stern to jovial.  Though I recommend 'Neverland' to some, I am still a bit reserved as many may be disappointed in its lack of intense feel-good moments and ""inspirational"" schmaltz.  Unlike the play 'Peter Pan' itself, Forster's own Neverland is too simple and restricted to be entirely moving.",4,More like three-and-a-half stars: reserved recommendation.,1100995200,"11 21, 2004",2004,2264,"[""'Finding"", 'Neverland', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'play-write', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'inspirations', 'would', 'result', 'possibly', 'most', 'famous', 'work', 'Pan', 'inspiration', 'Llewelyn', 'Davies', 'family', 'composed', 'widowed', 'Sylvia', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'cynical', 'mother', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'four', 'boys', 'including', 'young', 'adult', 'Peter', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'increasingly', 'apathetic', 'depressed', 'following', 'father', 'death', 'story', 'one', 'magic', 'film', 'However', 'opportunity', 'more', 'interesting', 'subject', 'matter', 'director', 'Mark', 'Forster', 'new', 'film', 'feels', 'quite', 'processed', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'cheese-loving', 'Miramax', 'are', 'difficulties', 'nothing', 'audience', 'even', 'performances', 'given', 'appropriately', 'softened', 'Depp', 'disappointingly', 'plain', 'not', 'was', 'given', 'much', 'work', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'seem', 'settle', 'one', 'horizon', 'cease', 'expand', 'respective', 'characters', 'develop', 'nuance', 'short-comings', ""'Finding"", 'Neverland', 'often-times', 'endearing', 'piece', 'work', 'proving', 'perfect', 'production', 'value', 'are', 'even', 'delicious', 'supporting', 'roles', 'seem', 'exist', 'only', 'spice', 'up', 'screen', 'likes', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'doing', 'well', 'small', 'underwritten', 'roles', 'highlight', 'film', 'young', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'who', 'young', 'age', 'fully', 'emote', 'elicit', 'honest', 'emotional', 'response', 'key', 'break-down', 'scene', 'Highmore', 'nearly', 'had', 'tears', 'other', 'reasons', 'will', 'draw', 'many', 'film', 'expect', 'rank', 'high', 'weekend', 'box', 'office', 'charts', 'Mark', 'Forster', 'film', 'generously', 'even', 'pace', 'so', ""'Neverland"", 'will', 'keep', 'audience', 'awake', 'screenplay', 'short', 'making', 'themes', 'imagination', 'vs.', 'cynicism', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'many', 'adults', 'herein', 'feel', 'much', 'too', 'black-and-white', 'rather', 'quick', 'group', 'transition', 'stern', 'jovial', 'recommend', 'am', 'still', 'bit', 'reserved', 'many', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'intense', 'feel-good', 'moments', 'inspirational', 'schmaltz', 'play', 'Pan', 'Forster', 'own', 'Neverland', 'too', 'simple', 'restricted', 'be', 'entirely', 'moving']",Finding Neverland
880134,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B0007CNXUK,Wesley Mullins,"[0, 2]","At the beginning of ""Finding Neverland"", struggling playwright J.M. Barrie (Depp) is in a rut, as he has been creating uninspiring and boring plays. The film suggests he tried to write to his audience, rather than remaining true to his own worldview and letting everyone see his unique form of genius. Barrie discovers the secret to unlocking his brilliance when he develops a deep platonic love for a widow and her four young boys and draws on them as his muse. From his time with the fatherless family, the world is given the play ""Peter Pan"".Although Barrie develops a powerful and strangely non-sexual love for the mother of the boys (Kate Winslet), it is his relationship with her children that touches his heart and opens a path toward emotions he has repressed for years. Seeing the innocence in them reminds Barrie of a simpler time in his life when dreams came true and magic lurked around every corner.He immerses himself in their lives, inventing imagination outlets for the boys and driving them to believe in dreams and wonder. What Barrie feels for the children is hard to explain (and in today's time would be viewed with a few raised eyebrows). He develops the kind of pure, unconditional love that convinces others it must be tainted in some way. No man can love a stranger's four boys so much.Like ""Shakespeare in Love"", the audience gets to see how real life events become iconic moments from literature. The film's lasting images include beautiful dissolves from reality to imagination, as Barrie's mind alters and sculpts experiences to fit his play. One unforgettable image begins with the four boys jumping on their beds and (in Barrie's mind) becomes the famous scene from ""Peter Pan"" where the children float out of their bedroom.While the film makes important declarations as to the power of wide-eyed youthful imagination and challenges viewers to recapture the wonder of childhood, it at times becomes laborious to watch. The only real conflict in the film is painfully artificial and clich&eacute;d (disapproval from Barrie's wife and the boys' grandmother). Indeed, it is an inspirational and magical film, but it just seems to be lacking a little something extra to make it great.",4,"Moving and Magical, but overall Unremarkable",1109030400,"02 22, 2005",2005,2211,"['beginning', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'struggling', 'playwright', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'Depp', 'rut', 'been', 'creating', 'uninspiring', 'boring', 'plays', 'film', 'tried', 'write', 'audience', 'rather', 'remaining', 'true', 'own', 'worldview', 'letting', 'everyone', 'see', 'unique', 'form', 'genius', 'Barrie', 'secret', 'unlocking', 'brilliance', 'when', 'deep', 'platonic', 'love', 'widow', 'four', 'young', 'boys', 'draws', 'muse', 'time', 'fatherless', 'family', 'world', 'given', 'play', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Barrie', 'powerful', 'strangely', 'non-sexual', 'love', 'mother', 'boys', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'relationship', 'children', 'heart', 'path', 'emotions', 'repressed', 'years', 'Seeing', 'innocence', 'Barrie', 'simpler', 'time', 'life', 'when', 'dreams', 'came', 'true', 'magic', 'lurked', 'corner.He', 'lives', 'inventing', 'imagination', 'outlets', 'boys', 'driving', 'believe', 'dreams', 'wonder', 'What', 'Barrie', 'children', 'hard', 'explain', 'today', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'viewed', 'few', 'raised', 'eyebrows', 'kind', 'pure', 'unconditional', 'love', 'others', 'must', 'be', 'tainted', 'way', 'man', 'can', 'love', 'stranger', 'four', 'boys', 'so', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'audience', 'see', 'how', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'become', 'iconic', 'moments', 'literature', 'film', 'lasting', 'images', 'include', 'beautiful', 'dissolves', 'reality', 'imagination', 'Barrie', 'mind', 'alters', 'sculpts', 'experiences', 'fit', 'play', 'One', 'unforgettable', 'image', 'four', 'boys', 'jumping', 'beds', 'Barrie', 'mind', 'famous', 'scene', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'where', 'children', 'float', 'film', 'important', 'declarations', 'power', 'wide-eyed', 'youthful', 'imagination', 'viewers', 'recapture', 'wonder', 'childhood', 'times', 'becomes', 'laborious', 'watch', 'only', 'real', 'conflict', 'film', 'painfully', 'artificial', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'disapproval', 'Barrie', 'wife', 'boys', 'grandmother', 'Indeed', 'inspirational', 'magical', 'film', 'just', 'be', 'lacking', 'little', 'something', 'extra', 'make', 'great']",Finding Neverland

He just wants to do whatever he does best, even if the grownups (like him, sort of) don't get it. Yet another, grimmer view of this story finds much to question in this man's fascination with little boys, an echo of Lewis Carroll's dark side.All the levels present themselves at once - maybe more than once, as scenes keep coming back to the viewer, even days later. It's a well-made movie, and an emotionally powerful one (if that's what you want).

The thrill of staying young forever, flying away to distant lands, and battling pirates is one that can easily capture the imagination of the young.  ""Finding Neverland"" is the story of how James Barrie created that magical universe that has stood the test of time.For a basic plot summary, ""Finding Neverland"" sees struggling playwright James Barrie (Johnny Depp) introduced to Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet), a widow with four young children, on a chance encounter at a local park.  While forming a bond with Sylvia and especially her playful children, Barrie begins to realize the power of ""play"" and ""imagination"" and begins to incorporate those elements into a new play about a boy who never grows up.This film is very successful on two different levels:1. The backstory on Barrie/Davies is very interesting.  I knew nothing about it going in, so I can't speak to the accuracy of all the events depicted, but it sure seems as if Barrie was truly inspired by the Davies children.2. For fans of the Peter Pan narrative, seeing the story come together bit by bit is a visual and emotional treat.  It is kind of strange to think of the Pan story as anything but pure childhood escapism fiction, but this movie shows us how it was quite real to the actors, theater-goers, and producers of the day.Only helping matters is the solid acting by Depp and Winslet, who are both so ""classically trained"" in acting (I believe they have both done much theater) that their casting is perfect in this period piece.Overall, then, ""Finding Neverland"" is a fun, informative film for fans of the Peter Pan cannon.  It will bring out your emotions, humor, and sense of history while viewing.",5,"The Magic Of ""Pan""",1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,1784,"['magic', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'universe', 'something', 'most', 'children', 'experience', 'time', 'lives', 'thrill', 'staying', 'young', 'forever', 'flying', 'away', 'distant', 'lands', 'battling', 'pirates', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'capture', 'imagination', 'young', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'story', 'how', 'James', 'Barrie', 'created', 'magical', 'universe', 'stood', 'test', 'time.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'struggling', 'playwright', 'James', 'Barrie', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'introduced', 'Sylvia', 'Davies', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'widow', 'four', 'young', 'children', 'chance', 'encounter', 'local', 'park', 'forming', 'bond', 'Sylvia', 'especially', 'playful', 'children', 'Barrie', 'realize', 'power', 'play', 'imagination', 'incorporate', 'elements', 'new', 'play', 'boy', 'who', 'never', 'up.This', 'film', 'very', 'successful', 'two', 'different', 'levels:1', 'backstory', 'Barrie/Davies', 'very', 'interesting', 'knew', 'nothing', 'going', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'accuracy', 'events', 'depicted', 'sure', 'Barrie', 'was', 'truly', 'inspired', 'Davies', 'children.2', 'fans', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'narrative', 'seeing', 'story', 'come', 'together', 'bit', 'bit', 'visual', 'emotional', 'treat', 'kind', 'strange', 'think', 'Pan', 'story', 'anything', 'pure', 'childhood', 'escapism', 'fiction', 'movie', 'how', 'was', 'quite', 'real', 'actors', 'theater-goers', 'producers', 'day.Only', 'helping', 'matters', 'solid', 'acting', 'Depp', 'Winslet', 'who', 'are', 'classically', 'trained', 'acting', 'believe', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'theater', 'casting', 'perfect', 'period', 'piece.Overall', 'then', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'fun', 'informative', 'film', 'fans', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'cannon', 'will', 'bring', 'out', 'emotions', 'humor', 'sense', 'history', 'viewing']",Finding Neverland
880138,A3ADK3ZTJ87915,B0007CNXUK,"Zinta Aistars ""Writer & Editor""","[5, 7]","Movies are just one means of enjoying flights into fancy, escaping from the everyday into a world of fantasy, where all things are possible. Imagination rules the day, and with imagination, there are no rules.The on-screen story of J. M. Barrie (played by Johnny Depp) as the author/playwright of Peter Pan is a delightful flight into another world, if not always one that is removed from the pains and bruisings of reality. Inspired by (if on occasion departing from) true events, the story about the writing of the story shows the evolving friendship between Barrie and the widow Davies (played by Kate Winslet) and her four young sons.Barrie meets the family while sitting on a park bench writing ideas for a play. I was charmed from the moment Depp seamlessly left his creative work to give in to a moment of play with the boy curled up below the park bench. While in reality I have watched such attempts from adults to come down to the level of children in relating to them as playmates appear a mix of patronizing at worst, clumsy at best, Depp, as Barrie, suffers no such stumbling. Surely, neither did Barrie, or he would not have created such a work of playfulness, even inspiring a psychological term of ""the Peter Pan syndrome"" to refer to adult men who refuse to grow up.But there is a child in all of us, isn't there? There should be. Just as there is the wisdom of the ancients, and perhaps the two go hand in hand, as playmates. Barrie soon spends his days, when he is not writing, playing with the four boys. Games of cowboys and Indians, heroes and villains, pirates and kings. Play unlocks Barrie's creativity to eventually become the groundbreaking play, Peter Pan (with Dustin Hoffman as curmudgeonly theatre producer who goes along with a begrudging trust in Barrie's talent, even while spouting doubt after doubt). Somewhat in the background to all of this play is the widow Davies, and one never quite understands whether there is a romantic bond forming or simply one of deeply felt friendship. We never see the relationship between the two adults develop beyond the latter, although love is evident. Barrie already has a wife, and we see her pain, too, as she loses her husband to the widow's family and her own marriage unravels. Neglected, she finds another companion, and the Barrie marriage is over.These are the pangs of reality. They, too, show up in Peter Pan on the stage. There is death, there is loss, there is grief. But there is also the magic of taking flight, ""real"" and of the spirit. The on stage story parallels the story off stage.We know already that the play, Peter Pan, becomes a classic, and rightfully so. But I found myself often watching the story behind the story unfold with the bittersweetness of nostalgia and longing. I watched the magic of creativity, of art. I saw the human connections made and unmade, fragile and tender, between adult and adult, adult and child. I saw a world, real and imaginary, that has so often become lost to us, as we increasingly replace imagination with a crass and ugly reality, or, perhaps more accurately referred to as--indulgence.Depp is exquisite. I've come to expect that from this actor. Winslet is convincing, offering not too much, not too little, with excellent timing. The four boys, especially young Peter, are wonderful. Were there more such children today! Were there more such adults who knew how to play.Recommended.",5,The serious work of play,1112745600,"04 6, 2005",2005,3418,"['Movies', 'are', 'just', 'one', 'means', 'enjoying', 'flights', 'fancy', 'escaping', 'everyday', 'world', 'fantasy', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'possible', 'Imagination', 'rules', 'day', 'imagination', 'are', 'rules.The', 'on-screen', 'story', 'J.', 'M.', 'Barrie', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'author/playwright', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'delightful', 'flight', 'world', 'not', 'always', 'one', 'removed', 'pains', 'bruisings', 'reality', 'Inspired', 'occasion', 'departing', 'true', 'events', 'story', 'writing', 'story', 'evolving', 'friendship', 'Barrie', 'widow', 'Davies', 'played', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'four', 'young', 'sons.Barrie', 'family', 'sitting', 'park', 'bench', 'writing', 'ideas', 'play', 'was', 'charmed', 'moment', 'Depp', 'seamlessly', 'left', 'creative', 'work', 'give', 'moment', 'play', 'boy', 'curled', 'up', 'park', 'bench', 'reality', 'have', 'watched', 'such', 'attempts', 'adults', 'come', 'down', 'level', 'children', 'relating', 'playmates', 'appear', 'mix', 'patronizing', 'worst', 'clumsy', 'best', 'Depp', 'Barrie', 'such', 'stumbling', 'Surely', 'did', 'Barrie', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'created', 'work', 'playfulness', 'even', 'inspiring', 'psychological', 'term', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'syndrome', 'refer', 'adult', 'men', 'who', 'refuse', 'grow', 'up.But', 'child', ""n't"", 'there', 'should', 'be', 'Just', 'wisdom', 'ancients', 'perhaps', 'two', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'playmates', 'Barrie', 'soon', 'days', 'when', 'not', 'writing', 'playing', 'four', 'boys', 'Games', 'cowboys', 'Indians', 'heroes', 'villains', 'pirates', 'kings', 'Play', 'unlocks', 'Barrie', 'creativity', 'eventually', 'become', 'groundbreaking', 'play', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'curmudgeonly', 'theatre', 'producer', 'who', 'along', 'begrudging', 'trust', 'Barrie', 'talent', 'even', 'spouting', 'doubt', 'doubt', 'Somewhat', 'background', 'play', 'widow', 'Davies', 'one', 'never', 'quite', 'romantic', 'bond', 'forming', 'simply', 'one', 'deeply', 'felt', 'friendship', 'never', 'see', 'relationship', 'two', 'adults', 'develop', 'latter', 'love', 'evident', 'Barrie', 'already', 'wife', 'see', 'pain', 'too', 'husband', 'widow', 'family', 'own', 'marriage', 'unravels', 'Neglected', 'companion', 'Barrie', 'marriage', 'over.These', 'are', 'pangs', 'reality', 'too', 'show', 'up', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'stage', 'death', 'loss', 'grief', 'also', 'magic', 'taking', 'flight', 'real', 'spirit', 'stage', 'story', 'story', 'stage.We', 'know', 'already', 'play', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'classic', 'rightfully', 'so', 'found', 'often', 'watching', 'story', 'story', 'unfold', 'bittersweetness', 'nostalgia', 'longing', 'watched', 'magic', 'creativity', 'art', 'saw', 'human', 'connections', 'made', 'unmade', 'fragile', 'tender', 'adult', 'adult', 'adult', 'child', 'saw', 'world', 'real', 'imaginary', 'so', 'often', 'become', 'lost', 'increasingly', 'replace', 'imagination', 'crass', 'ugly', 'reality', 'perhaps', 'more', 'accurately', 'referred', 'indulgence.Depp', 'exquisite', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'actor', 'Winslet', 'convincing', 'offering', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'too', 'little', 'excellent', 'timing', 'four', 'boys', 'especially', 'young', 'Peter', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Were', 'there', 'more', 'such', 'children', 'today', 'Were', 'there', 'more', 'such', 'adults', 'who', 'knew', 'how', 'play.Recommended']",Finding Neverland
