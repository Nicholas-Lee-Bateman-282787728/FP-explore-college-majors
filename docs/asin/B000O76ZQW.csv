1062749,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000O76ZQW,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Every working class neighborhood has produced (and produces), if those that I have lived in are indicative, its fair share of drifters, grifters, lamsters, short moneymen, wise guys and just plain big talkers. In classical Marxist speak this element is called the lumpenproletariat and in political terms is a drag on the class struggle and the feeding grounds for fueling reactionary and counter-revolutionary movements. In short, bad news.I am willing to bet, and make that bet 6/5, that any interested reader looking at this review to get the 'skinny' on Damon Runyon's short stories of film, here ""Big Street,"" probably did not bargain for the above analysis. Fair enough. Okay, we will suspend disbelief about the true nature of these types for as long as it takes to get through this collection. Damon Runyon has taken that collection of drifters, grifters and con artists and their `dolls' and headquartered them, mainly in one place, New York's Broadway, the Great White Way of the 1920's and 1930's, and given us some very memorable stories about the sometimes hilarious, sometimes poignant as here, trials and tribulations of this motley crew.Runyon's great art is to have an ear for the kind of dialogue that those on the hustle would produce if such a rogue's gallery of lumpen types as the Hot Horse Herbies, Skys, Sam the Gonolphs, Bookie Bobbies and the rest of the cock-eyed tribe ever had time to talk to each other. It is no secret that every little sub-culture has its own mores, language and sense of what passes for honor. Runyon takes this and exaggerates the effect but also in many cases puts an edge on it. ""The Big Street"" has a tragic- comedic starting off as a goof on caf&eacute; society busboy Henry Fonda's off-beat `crush"" on torch singer Lucille Ball. And Ms. Ball is nothing but a, well, nothing but... The story line is driven by her gold-digger crazed desires to hit the Mayfair swells big time, her fall (literally) and her dreams of grandeur (small-sized) which our boy Henry, against his usual strong and sturdy type-casting, raises heaven and earth (and maybe the Holland Tunnel)  to carry out. And in the end he cannot do more than see that her last wish is carried out.Some commentators have argued that Runyon was just a cynic and had contempt for his characters (or for the real life characters that he based them on). Maybe, so. But if you want to look at a time and place that never really existed, except as caricature, then this is your stop.

Here we have lucy tries to be a movie actress? Like many of the actors and actresses of old hollywood they often visited the studio bosses looking for plum parts,and who could really make a career for them. The old studio bosses were knowledgeable,every writer,every producer,bit star actor,film proposal who was working on what,and even b pictures,and lesser stuff going on,and film distribution...i dont know if you went to a holywood studio today if the would be so representative of these old mavericks...i'm sure it has only improved. If we look back at a later time before discussing this film,while promoting a later film the long long trailer with then husband desi whoaccompanied her to her home town,on a promotional tour,the two seemed odd together on this promotional junket,and i dont know whether how her career developed really turned our how she wanted it to be...but she never really could convince the studio execs to give her the roles she wanted..and you couldnt argue with them regarding knowledge,they would tell you exactly why another actress was much better suited to the role. Also the business behind it,all the actors and actresses they knew and in great detail all about them...Henry fonda is here as costar and is very good as usual and is one of the better actors who survived into the 60's with roles as advise & consent and fail safe. His reputation he felt in the 60's was inaccurately portrayed and personality not accurately guaged and i may write of this later...here we have lucy agains type as a diva,not playing a nice creation,wheel chair bound on the way to florida as a disabled person,with her doting servant fonda,meeting her every whim from robbery to just about everything,with a small plot of paranoia,not really developed...when you watch this film,which is odd so well worth watching,you feel yes we are watching something good,a depiction of life that is there,...but sadly lucy seems uninteresting here,and she and fonda dont really gel or have charisma,like lucy and desi returning home in the mid 50's she seemed out of sorts,..this may be one of her better roles and also his...here the one who serves and who accepts the service...there's something not there...although its rare to see this film well worth watching...Ithank PBS for showing the early interview from the Buffalo area of lucy and desi when in the area promoting the film..there are two lucy memorabilia tapes out and one has her children at this home town area...but i wonder whether this tape will be produced...i know its there i saw it and recall and i find it very informative",4,change of role for star in different film,1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,2841,"['interesting', 'when', 'watch', 'person', 'who', 'tried', 'be', 'serious', 'star', 'lucille', 'ball', 'ended', 'up', 'tv', 'long', 'tenure', 'everyone', 'mind', 'here', 'have', 'her', 'film', 'see', 'type', 'actress', 'tried', 'be', 'Here', 'have', 'lucy', 'tries', 'be', 'movie', 'actress', 'many', 'actors', 'actresses', 'old', 'hollywood', 'often', 'visited', 'studio', 'looking', 'plum', 'parts', 'who', 'could', 'really', 'make', 'career', 'old', 'studio', 'bosses', 'were', 'knowledgeable', 'writer', 'producer', 'bit', 'star', 'actor', 'film', 'proposal', 'who', 'was', 'working', 'what', 'even', 'b', 'pictures', 'lesser', 'stuff', 'going', 'film', 'distribution', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'went', 'holywood', 'studio', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'representative', 'old', 'mavericks', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'only', 'improved', 'look', 'back', 'later', 'time', 'discussing', 'film', 'promoting', 'later', 'film', 'long', 'long', 'trailer', 'then', 'husband', 'desi', 'whoaccompanied', 'home', 'town', 'promotional', 'tour', 'two', 'seemed', 'odd', 'together', 'promotional', 'junket', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'how', 'career', 'developed', 'really', 'turned', 'how', 'wanted', 'be', 'never', 'really', 'could', 'convince', 'studio', 'execs', 'give', 'roles', 'wanted..and', 'couldnt', 'argue', 'regarding', 'knowledge', 'would', 'tell', 'exactly', 'why', 'actress', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'suited', 'role', 'Also', 'business', 'actors', 'knew', 'great', 'detail', 'Henry', 'fonda', 'here', 'costar', 'very', 'good', 'usual', 'one', 'better', 'actors', 'who', 'survived', '60', 'roles', 'advise', 'consent', 'fail', 'safe', 'reputation', 'felt', '60', 'was', 'inaccurately', 'portrayed', 'personality', 'not', 'accurately', 'guaged', 'i', 'may', 'write', 'later', 'here', 'have', 'lucy', 'agains', 'type', 'diva', 'not', 'playing', 'nice', 'creation', 'wheel', 'chair', 'bound', 'way', 'florida', 'disabled', 'person', 'doting', 'servant', 'fonda', 'meeting', 'whim', 'robbery', 'just', 'everything', 'small', 'plot', 'paranoia', 'not', 'really', 'developed', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'odd', 'so', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'something', 'good', 'depiction', 'life', 'there', 'sadly', 'lucy', 'uninteresting', 'here', 'fonda', 'dont', 'really', 'gel', 'have', 'charisma', 'lucy', 'desi', 'returning', 'home', 'mid', '50', 'seemed', 'sorts', '..this', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'better', 'roles', 'also', 'here', 'one', 'who', 'who', 'accepts', 'service', 'something', 'not', 'there', 'rare', 'see', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'Ithank', 'PBS', 'showing', 'early', 'interview', 'Buffalo', 'area', 'lucy', 'desi', 'when', 'area', 'promoting', 'are', 'two', 'lucy', 'memorabilia', 'one', 'children', 'home', 'town', 'area', 'i', 'wonder', 'tape', 'will', 'be', 'produced', 'i', 'know', 'i', 'saw', 'recall', 'i', 'find', 'very', 'informative']",N/A

Most of them are comedic (though do not often equal the quality of any of her Lucy personas), many roles were small, and only a few were dramatic. I think this one by far showed the largest range of acting ability and depth, though I liked certain other movies more.The movie was... well, weird. As hard as I tried, I could not understand Little Pinks's fascination with Lucy's character Gloria. Infatuation is one thing, but when that affection is not only not returned in the slightest, you would think it would fade over time. Especially when one is abused! Pinks is often called a fool by his friends, yet he still caters to Gloria's every whim. I was ready to scream when Pinks finally walked away... and of course there just happened to be someone else right there to push Gloria's chair. It would have served her right to have to just sit there for a while and think, waiting until someone finally came to help, and realize she is actually dependent and shouldn't be so nasty and should maybe, just maybe, be a little bit grateful instead.Well, we all know people in life who stay with abusive partners, and we just ask, why??

1062757,A3I9PUR2E3BSJC,B000O76ZQW,"Ruth Anderson ""Book Reviewer""","[3, 4]","I actually had pretty high hopes for The Big Street when I discovered that it's based on a Damon Runyon short story since I'm a huge fan of his work, and Guys and Dolls is one of my all-time favorite shows. Runyon had quite a knack for creating hilarious, quirky, and unforgettable characters. I haven't read the short story ""Little Pinks"" that was the basis for this film, but after watching Street I have to think the story works better in print versus on-screen. Lucille Ball's pre-television screen roles are actually pretty interesting, primarily because the roles are usually the antithesis of the flamboyant comedienne she later became known and loved for through the I Love Lucy show. That said, Lucy's character, Gloria, in The Big Street is almost shocking because she's so selfish and unlikable. Henry Fonda's character only compounds the difficulty of relating to anyone in this movie at all - his timid busboy ""Pinks"" is so slavishly devoted Gloria for no apparent reason that when I wasn't repulsed by Gloria's meanness I wanted to smack Pinks upside the head with a baseball bat for being such a doormat. Apparently it's not enough to have Fonda and Ball play so extremely against type, because about halfway through the movie completely jumps the shark and veers into the realm of insanity when Pinks pushes Gloria from NEW YORK CITY to FLORIDA in her wheelchair. I kid you not. Yet I can't call this movie completely bad - it's more freakishly bizarre. I have to give Fonda and Ball credit for giving these roles, which now seem so antithetical to their commonly known screen personas, their all. My favorite appearances are by Agnes Moorehead as Pinks' friend Violette and Eugene Pallette as Nicely-Nicely Johnson (of Guys and Dolls fame). It's a real treat especially to see Moorehead play such a sweetheart since she's typically cast in more ""prickly"" roles. The Big Street is so incredibly odd and off-beat it was interesting to watch once (I'll give it this, I was engaged in that way you are when you spend the whole time staring at the screen going ""I don't believe this!!""), but it's not a film I'll be revisiting.
