913470,A364W6U6YL219D,B0009UZG64,"Craig Edwards ""Media Guy""","[1, 2]","Dennis the Menace (1993) Hank Ketcham's comic strip character is brought to life as the latest attempt by John Hughes to cash in on his own Home Alone series. It's really too bad, because the film is so perfectly cast: Mason Gamble (Spy Hard) is an acceptable Dennis; Lea Thompson (Back to the Future) and Robert Stanton (Bob Roberts) couldn't be more likable as Dennis' parents; and Walter Matthau and Joan Plowright are absolutely perfect as Mr. and Mrs. Wilson. But the film, which starts off well, eventually slides directly into Home Alone territory, especially with the introduction of a thief character (Christopher Lloyd-Back to the Future) whom Dennis trips up in that painful ""Kevin vs Harry and Marv"" way. This one gets sooo painful, in fact, it's nearly unwatchable. Still, the kids are sure to love, so there will probably be a viewing in your future if you're a parent.",2,Oh Mr. Wilsonnn......,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,883,"['Dennis', 'Menace', '1993', 'Hank', 'Ketcham', 'comic', 'strip', 'character', 'brought', 'life', 'latest', 'attempt', 'John', 'Hughes', 'cash', 'own', 'Home', 'Alone', 'series', 'really', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'so', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Mason', 'Gamble', 'Spy', 'Hard', 'acceptable', 'Dennis', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'Back', 'Future', 'Robert', 'Stanton', 'Bob', 'Roberts', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'likable', 'Dennis', 'parents', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'are', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Wilson', 'film', 'off', 'well', 'eventually', 'directly', 'Home', 'Alone', 'territory', 'especially', 'introduction', 'thief', 'character', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd-Back', 'Future', 'whom', 'Dennis', 'up', 'painful', 'Kevin', 'vs', 'Harry', 'Marv', 'way', 'one', 'sooo', 'painful', 'fact', 'nearly', 'unwatchable', 'Still', 'kids', 'are', 'sure', 'love', 'there', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'viewing', 'future', ""'re"", 'parent']",Dennis the Menace / Dennis the Menace: Strikes Again
