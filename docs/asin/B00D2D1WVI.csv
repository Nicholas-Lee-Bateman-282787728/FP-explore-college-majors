The writing is superb, the mysteries intriguing and the characters unforgettable.  Chief of Police Jesse Stone has flaws that include his inability to get over his ex-wife, a distrust of modern technology and alcoholism. He plays the character so well you actually feel like he's really this fictional character. The first time the Hallmark Channel ran this series, I expected it to be much less compelling than it turned out to be. I recommend that you watch the first movie and see if you don't buy the second one to see what happens next.

1653081,A2364DJDJWF5LO,B00D2D1WVI,Chase Leon,"[2, 2]","I have watched and greatly enjoyed all eight &#34;Jesse Stone&#34; movies. Hopefully, &#34;Benefit of the Doubt&#34; won't be the last, because this series is so well written and well performed, it's like Selleck and company are just hitting their stride.This is a very old fashioned series, meaning that it relies on intelligence, substance and patience, rather than the current style of micro-fast editing, totally rad dialog and trendy clothes and hair that similar &#34;police&#34; movies rely on. Fortunately, in Paradise, there are actually people over 35 years old.The Jesse Stone series is a very reflective and highly atmospheric series, and there is indeed an audience for this type of show, as every &#34;Stone&#34; movie has been a ratings winner.Sadly, the powers-that-be at CBS who have been producing them claim they won't be doing any more in this series, because they are giving in to the younger (and larger) demographic that prefers the super-fast style and minimum (if any) substance. It's really their stupidity and their loss if this all proves to be true.Tom Selleck, who is perfect for this role,  has stated that he's not tired of this character, and perhaps a cable channel will pick up the series. Millions of intelligent fans hope that this is true, and will happily look forward to eight more in the series.As it stands, I am a very happy fan of the eight movies thus far, and I applaud CBS for giving them to us.

1653088,A17D77DFID0GZG,B00D2D1WVI,"dsrussell ""greyhater""","[0, 0]","As I told my friends and family, if you like the first in the series, you'll like them all.  That being said, if you didn't like the first one, then don't bother with the others.  This makes testing out the series relatively painless and without a lot of money flying out of your pocket.  Just rent the first (Night Passage) and see if you like it or not.  BTW, the current price of this set (May of 2014) is three times the price I paid 3 months ago in February of 2014, so either buy them individually or the set when it is properly priced (hat or no hat).If you're looking for intense plots or non-stop action, this isn't the series to get.  If you're looking for pristine picture quality and deep, wall-slamming bass, this isn't the series either (it doesn't come in blu-ray format).  However, there is nothing wrong with either the picture if one's player has up-converting capability, or the sound.  Actually, the soundtrack is appropriate and nicely done throughout.  This is a very laid back character study of a homicide detective fired from the LAPD. for being drunk on the job.  The back story is his wife cheated on him, then divorced him, which led him to hit the bottle harder than usual, which then caused his firing.  What also keeps him drinking is his daily conversations with his ex-wife on the phone (we never see her).  Neither Jesse or his ex-wife can cut the cord, even though they've been divorced for 5 years.  He's obviously a very good and experienced detective even though he says he's not in the &#34;right and wrong business&#34; but in the &#34;legal and illegal business&#34;.  Yet, he's more than either of those things, but his continuing struggles holding on to his ex-wife often causes a downward spiral ending in booze.After being fired from the LAPD, Jesse leaves Southern California with his 10 year-old dog and not much else.  He has been offered a police chief job in, of all places, the fictional town of Paradise Massachusetts -- a small sea-side community of around 25,000 people and not too far from Boston.  It was obviously one of very few jobs, if any, offered to him.  But Stone wasn't born yesterday, and immediately wondered why they wanted to hire him.  It doesn't take long for him to find out.  They were looking for someone they could control and have him look the other way.  It's an easy paycheck for a drunk if he could just write speeding and parking tickets, police small-town petty complaints, mind his own business and leave well enough alone, or so the community leader / leaders thought.The cast of characters are all rounded out very nicely and the acting is first-rate throughout.  Tom Selleck is in top form here, as is all of the regular cast and guest cast of well-known supporting actors/actresses.  These are very believable, everyday characters and not cartoon cutouts.  These are people with minor or not so minor flaws that try to get by day-to-day.  Even many of the bad guys aren't all bad, although there are a few.  It makes for a very enjoyable, although not what I would call thrilling, ride.Here's another thing I found out after I began watching this series.  It was difficult not to immediately put in the second movie, then a third.  It took me all of 3-1/2 days to view them all, and I was trying hard to pace myself.  That is called being hooked.  It hooked my friends the same way it hooked me.  They couldn't stop at the first one either, and played two or more per night.  It's also a series one will be happy to revisit surprisingly often.Between 1 and 10, I don't think it deserves more than an 8, or 4 stars (I do have a few minor complaints).  However, this series hooked me like few others have, so I am going to give the Jesse Stone series a marginal 9, or 5 stars.  It has an intangible quality that is hard for me to easily explain.  One of my all time favorite series was Firefly (a no-brainer 5-star series for me), yet I know I'll revisit the Stone series more often than Firefly.  Heck, I've already been through the series twice in three months, and could probably pull it out again today and enjoy it thoroughly.  Matter-of-fact, after writing this, I think I'll do just that.Here is the order of viewing:Night Passage (prequel to Stone Cold)Stone Cold (aired first, but second in the series)Death in ParadiseSea ChangeThin IceNo RemorseInnocents LostBenefit of Doubt",5,Fascinating character study.,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,4370,"['told', 'friends', 'family', 'like', 'first', 'series', ""'ll"", 'like', 'being', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'first', 'one', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'others', 'testing', 'out', 'series', 'relatively', 'painless', 'lot', 'money', 'flying', 'pocket', 'Just', 'rent', 'first', 'Night', 'Passage', 'see', 'like', 'not', 'BTW', 'current', 'price', 'set', 'May', '2014', 'three', 'times', 'price', 'paid', '3', 'months', 'ago', 'February', '2014', 'buy', 'individually', 'set', 'when', 'properly', 'priced', 'hat', 'hat', '.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'intense', 'plots', 'non-stop', 'action', ""n't"", 'series', 'get', ""'re"", 'looking', 'pristine', 'picture', 'quality', 'deep', 'wall-slamming', 'bass', ""n't"", 'series', ""n't"", 'come', 'blu-ray', 'format', 'However', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'picture', 'one', 'player', 'up-converting', 'capability', 'sound', 'Actually', 'soundtrack', 'appropriate', 'nicely', 'done', 'very', 'laid', 'back', 'character', 'study', 'homicide', 'detective', 'fired', 'LAPD', 'being', 'drunk', 'job', 'back', 'story', 'wife', 'cheated', 'then', 'divorced', 'led', 'hit', 'bottle', 'harder', 'usual', 'then', 'caused', 'firing', 'What', 'also', 'drinking', 'daily', 'conversations', 'ex-wife', 'phone', 'never', 'see', 'Jesse', 'ex-wife', 'can', 'cut', 'cord', 'even', ""'ve"", 'been', 'divorced', '5', 'years', 'obviously', 'very', 'good', 'experienced', 'detective', 'even', 'not', '34', 'right', 'wrong', 'business', '34', '34', 'legal', 'illegal', 'business', '34', 'more', 'things', 'continuing', 'struggles', 'holding', 'ex-wife', 'often', 'downward', 'spiral', 'ending', 'booze.After', 'being', 'fired', 'LAPD', 'Jesse', 'Southern', 'California', '10', 'year-old', 'dog', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'been', 'offered', 'police', 'chief', 'job', 'places', 'fictional', 'town', 'Paradise', 'Massachusetts', 'small', 'sea-side', 'community', '25,000', 'people', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'Boston', 'was', 'obviously', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'jobs', 'offered', 'Stone', 'was', ""n't"", 'born', 'yesterday', 'immediately', 'wondered', 'why', 'wanted', 'hire', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'find', 'out', 'were', 'looking', 'someone', 'could', 'control', 'have', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'easy', 'paycheck', 'drunk', 'could', 'just', 'write', 'speeding', 'parking', 'tickets', 'police', 'small-town', 'petty', 'complaints', 'mind', 'own', 'business', 'leave', 'well', 'enough', 'alone', 'so', 'community', 'leader', '/', 'leaders', 'thought.The', 'cast', 'characters', 'are', 'rounded', 'out', 'very', 'nicely', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'top', 'form', 'here', 'regular', 'cast', 'guest', 'cast', 'well-known', 'supporting', 'actors/actresses', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'everyday', 'characters', 'not', 'cartoon', 'cutouts', 'are', 'people', 'minor', 'not', 'so', 'minor', 'flaws', 'try', 'get', 'day-to-day', 'Even', 'many', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'bad', 'are', 'few', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'thrilling', 'thing', 'found', 'out', 'began', 'watching', 'series', 'was', 'difficult', 'not', 'immediately', 'put', 'second', 'movie', 'then', 'third', 'took', '3-1/2', 'days', 'view', 'was', 'trying', 'hard', 'pace', 'called', 'being', 'hooked', 'hooked', 'friends', 'same', 'way', 'hooked', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'first', 'one', 'either', 'played', 'two', 'more', 'night', 'also', 'series', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'revisit', 'surprisingly', 'often.Between', '1', '10', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'more', '8', '4', 'stars', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'minor', 'complaints', 'However', 'series', 'hooked', 'few', 'others', 'have', 'am', 'going', 'give', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'series', 'marginal', '9', '5', 'stars', 'intangible', 'quality', 'hard', 'easily', 'explain', 'One', 'time', 'favorite', 'series', 'was', 'Firefly', 'no-brainer', '5-star', 'series', 'yet', 'know', ""'ll"", 'revisit', 'Stone', 'series', 'more', 'often', 'Firefly', 'Heck', ""'ve"", 'already', 'been', 'series', 'twice', 'three', 'months', 'could', 'probably', 'pull', 'out', 'again', 'today', 'enjoy', 'thoroughly', 'Matter-of-fact', 'writing', 'think', ""'ll"", 'do', 'just', 'order', 'viewing', 'Night', 'Passage', 'prequel', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'aired', 'first', 'second', 'series', 'Death', 'ParadiseSea', 'ChangeThin', 'IceNo', 'RemorseInnocents', 'LostBenefit', 'Doubt']",Jesse Stone: The Complete Set
1653089,A3HQQ0G1HE0XEW,B00D2D1WVI,dwagamon@Bandag.com,"[0, 0]","This is a fantastic collection!  I was able to catch a few of the Jesse Stone movies on Hallmark but wanted to get the collection as I wanted to watch them again and again.  The collection gave me 3 movies I had not previously seen, which was a treat.  I think Tom Selleck is in his element as the aloof Jesse Stone.  After making some bad choices, Jesse ends up in a small town position - seen as his last chance.  The town council has little respect for him and the police staff are having issues giving up loyalty to the previous police chief.  Jesse is perceived as a loner who walks outside the box and ruffles feathers.  While most individuals see him as incompetent and troublesome, Jesse is busy putting the pieces together and honing in on the killer.  Tom Selleck does an amazing job portraying the hard drinking, troubled loner and you vary between feeling sorry for him and wondering why he can't get it together.

The screenplays follow Robert Parker's books very closely. These films aren't for everybody. There's a lot of dysfunctional misery expressed here. A dysfunctional cop obsesses over his ex-wife, who is screwing everything that walks...so he drinks and drinks...a lot. All the screenplays (and books)utilize the identical formula. Even though he's an alcoholic he has the foresight to solve obscure crimes and murders. The formula is subtle and unrushed. As if this weren't enough, the setting is the Northeast in constant rain and overcast, with morose piano music as background. Most people probably would not care for this type of rendition. They just don't want to wallow in this much depression and despair. Selleck has stated that he would continue to do more films in the series, but the studios won't buy them, due to excessive expense. They're very low-key, so most of the cost is probably Selleck's salary. But more than likely no more of the books will be made into films, as Selleck has moved on.

Like most Parker fans I think I was most taken by Spenser. But after reading all of that series I turned to the Jesse Stone series and found I liked them a great deal. It's quite extraordinary for a writer, any writer, to create two hugely successful lead characters each in their own series, but Parker did it.And Tom Selleck was the absolute perfect choice to play Stone. I really never paid that much attention to Selleck as actor, but in this series he won me over big time. This is one of those cases where, once you've seen an actor in a particular role, you simply can't imagine any other actor succeeding in that role. Selleck is a subtle and his character pained and emotionally wounded without being maudlin or boring. He is tough without throwing it in your face a lot (something Spenser did a bit, but it worked for him). He is really a joy to watch.I waited for this series to drop in price (I paid $42 right after the Xmas holidays, when it went on sale) and I'm so glad I bought it.

1653103,A39CB39366315Z,B00D2D1WVI,"K. E. Ruef ""BarnKat""","[0, 0]","Tom Selleck really does a fantastic job bringing Robert B. Parker's &#34;Jesse Stone&#34; to life.  I've been a fan of Parker for years, and I'm one of those readers who feels protective of the characters a good author creates.  I am pleased to be able to say that the entire cast here does an excellent job with Parker's cast of characters.  I bought this for my other half and we thought we had seen all of the movies, but the collection has two movies (Night Passage & Death in Paradise) that we did not even know existed.  Bonus!Now, about WHY this collection is as good as it is:First and foremost, with Robert B. Parker writing the original books and Tom Selleck playing the lead, how can you go wrong?  One of the things that made Parker such a great writer is that he put a lot of humanity into his characters.  They weren't anywhere close to invincible super-humans.  They were just human, prone to the same flaws and foibles any of us are.  With a little help from readers, they had the capacity to become real.  Same goes for Selleck's acting style.  He gets to know his characters, and his genuine concern for playing true to the part is obvious, even though he never appears to be working hard or reaching for it.  Which brings us to the next point...Selleck fills this role as comfortably as a favorite pair of jeans or those old sneakers you just can't toss out.  From the beginning, it seems he has been playing Jesse Stone for years.  Correction:  he's not playing Jesse Stone; he IS Jesse Stone.  As a Parker fan, I have a habit of playing the &#34;who could play them?&#34; game with the characters.  I hadn't with this series yet, but I couldn't have cast it any better if I had.The supporting cast is just that... supporting, but indispensable and incredibly well cast.  Moviemakers seem to sometimes forget that the supporting cast is there for a reason and that, no matter how big a name you have in the lead, it's hard to carry a movie with just one person.  No a problem with the Jesse Stone movies.  Rose, Suit, Hasty, and Dr. Dix... they are all strong enough to carry their scenes.  I don't know how things actually were on the set, but the finished product has that familiar rapport between characters who have known each other for years.  Kathy Baker (Rose Gammon) and Kohl Suddeth (Officer Luther &#34;Suitcase&#34; Simpson) are wonderful, playing in perfect balance to Selleck's brooding, imperfect Stone.  They are feeling characters, drawing you in and making the story real.  Saul Rubinek is councilman Hasty Hathaway... a snake-oil-selling carpetbagger who really does care about his friends in his own bizarre way.  Even the dog, Reggie, is as solid as a... Stone.If you like good drama, movies with heart, soul and a purpose, I definitely recommend the Jesse Stone collection.  I've seen a lot of comments about it being far too expensive a set, and maybe I agree.  $60 or more is a lot to pay, and you may be able to find them individually in the cheap bins at your local big box store.  Then again, for 8 brand new movies worth watching again, I'm not complaining.  It all depends on how much you value good... really good... entertainment.",5,Nice collection,1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,3180,"['Tom', 'Selleck', 'really', 'fantastic', 'job', 'bringing', 'Robert', 'B.', 'Parker', '34', 'Jesse', 'Stone', '34', 'life', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Parker', 'years', ""'m"", 'one', 'readers', 'who', 'feels', 'protective', 'characters', 'good', 'author', 'creates', 'am', 'pleased', 'be', 'able', 'say', 'entire', 'cast', 'here', 'excellent', 'job', 'Parker', 'cast', 'characters', 'bought', 'other', 'half', 'thought', 'had', 'seen', 'movies', 'collection', 'two', 'movies', 'Night', 'Passage', 'Death', 'Paradise', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'existed', 'Now', 'about', 'WHY', 'collection', 'as', 'good', 'First', 'foremost', 'Robert', 'B.', 'Parker', 'writing', 'original', 'books', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'playing', 'lead', 'how', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'One', 'things', 'made', 'Parker', 'great', 'writer', 'put', 'lot', 'humanity', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'close', 'invincible', 'super-humans', 'were', 'just', 'human', 'prone', 'same', 'flaws', 'are', 'little', 'help', 'readers', 'had', 'capacity', 'become', 'real', 'Same', 'Selleck', 'acting', 'style', 'know', 'characters', 'genuine', 'concern', 'playing', 'true', 'part', 'obvious', 'even', 'never', 'be', 'working', 'hard', 'reaching', 'Which', 'next', 'point', 'Selleck', 'role', 'as', 'comfortably', 'favorite', 'pair', 'jeans', 'old', 'sneakers', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'toss', 'out', 'beginning', 'been', 'playing', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'years', 'Correction', 'not', 'playing', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'Parker', 'fan', 'have', 'habit', 'playing', '34', 'who', 'could', 'play', '34', 'game', 'characters', 'had', ""n't"", 'series', 'yet', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'cast', 'better', 'had.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'just', 'supporting', 'indispensable', 'incredibly', 'well', 'cast', 'Moviemakers', 'seem', 'sometimes', 'forget', 'supporting', 'cast', 'there', 'reason', 'matter', 'how', 'big', 'name', 'have', 'lead', 'hard', 'carry', 'movie', 'just', 'one', 'person', 'problem', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'movies', 'Rose', 'Suit', 'Hasty', 'Dr.', 'Dix', 'are', 'strong', 'enough', 'carry', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'things', 'actually', 'were', 'set', 'finished', 'product', 'familiar', 'rapport', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'known', 'other', 'years', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'Rose', 'Gammon', 'Kohl', 'Suddeth', 'Officer', 'Luther', '34', 'Suitcase', '34', 'Simpson', 'are', 'wonderful', 'playing', 'perfect', 'balance', 'Selleck', 'brooding', 'imperfect', 'Stone', 'are', 'feeling', 'characters', 'drawing', 'making', 'story', 'real', 'Saul', 'Rubinek', 'councilman', 'Hasty', 'Hathaway', 'snake-oil-selling', 'carpetbagger', 'who', 'really', 'care', 'friends', 'own', 'bizarre', 'way', 'Even', 'dog', 'Reggie', 'as', 'solid', 'Stone.If', 'like', 'good', 'drama', 'movies', 'heart', 'soul', 'purpose', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'collection', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'comments', 'being', 'far', 'too', 'expensive', 'set', 'maybe', 'agree', '60', 'more', 'lot', 'pay', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'individually', 'cheap', 'bins', 'local', 'big', 'box', 'store', 'Then', 'again', '8', 'brand', 'new', 'movies', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'how', 'much', 'value', 'good', 'really', 'good', 'entertainment']",Jesse Stone: The Complete Set
1653104,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00D2D1WVI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[314, 319]","Note: A brief mention about pricing. While it's great to get all eight of the Jesse Stone films together in one convenient shipment, many have been around at bargain pricing for years. You may want to do a bit of shopping for a price configuration that makes sense to you if the ask here seems a little high.  This collection does house all 8 previously released DVDs in a new box with a replica of Jesse's PPD ball cap as additional swag.Included:2005: Stone Cold2006: Night Passage2006: Death In Paradise2007: Sea Change2009: Thin Ice2010: No Remorse2011: Innocents lost2012: Benefit Of The DoubtTom Selleck is Jesse Stone! I don't know who author Robert B. Parker might have envisioned inhabiting his iconic small town police chief, but Selleck has certainly owned and perfected the role over the course of these 8 made-for-TV movies. Stone must surely be one of the most laid back heroes to ever grace the small screen and Selleck has perfected the minimalism necessary to make this character stand out. In the film world of quick cut editing, these films defy expectation by unfolding at a very leisurely pace. For the most part, the mysteries place a distant second in importance to the characterizations and the humor developed in the scripts (for which Parker does share a writer's credit). For the Stone series to be successful, you've got to care about the principals. So while Selleck is as comfortable as an old slipper in his role, it is also important to single out the recurring cast that helps to sell these tidy mysteries. With stellar talents like Viola Davis, William Devane and Kathy Baker providing back-up (not to mention a quietly impressive Kohl Sudduth or a pretty cool dog), it's easy to become invested in this small community of characters no matter what challenge they're faced to solved.Starting with 2005's ""Stone Cold"" through 2012's ""Benefit of the Doubt,"" each of the eight films obviously has its own central plot and mystery. While the earlier films are probably regarded as stronger entries plot-wise, I do think each chapter has enough to recommend it on its own merits. You'll appreciate the films to varying degrees as with any serialization. Some you may love, some just like. The series gets progressively more introspective. Some of the later entries have enormous sections with very little dialogue. However, to my way of thinking, what has made this series terrific is the continuing back story and its respect to the characters. Jesse Stone and team have evolved through the years and their interactions, relationships and growth in the totality of these eight films is what is so very special.In truth, there is nothing necessarily ground-breaking here. Just old pros putting on some great entertainment. Lacking hysterics and over-the-top action set pieces, the Jesse Stone series is a quietly compelling throw-back to when stories and people mattered more than special effects.

1653110,A1GQAKL9CGQLP1,B00D2D1WVI,L. M. Keefer,"[107, 109]","If you like a detective series with a soul, this Jesse Stone series offers it up in the form of haunting and original music, inspired scenery and sets (love Stone's waterside home), quirky and realistic plots, insightful casting, gorgeous cinematography, and a sensitive but tough detective with Tom Selleck playing Jesse Stone.Jesse has a few of his own mysteries to solve, along with the ones he confronts in his work.  Is he ever going to not answer the phone when his ex-wife calls and just forget about her?  Will he be able to stop drinking?  Can he keep his community happy in the small northeastern town he polices and hang onto his job?  Will he ever find a woman who is sympatico?In between battling his own demons, therapy sessions with his shrink (William Devane), and cryptic conversations with just about everybody including his dog, Jesse manages to solve quite a few crimes with his non-police manual methods.In analyzing why this series is compelling, one reason is that it just feels real.  Selleck inhabits the role of Jesse Stone with ease.  You feel like he's playing some aspect of himself.  The secondary characters are strong.  You don't feel like you are watching a show.  You feel like it's real life.  And you care about the characters.  Even the crooks have a sort of likability in some instances.This is the kind of series you could watch every year.  Although another show hasn't been purchased by CBS, Selleck said in an interview that he thinks someone will want to produce another episode.  We hope Selleck is right.

I'm reviewing the actual product that goes on sale next week.

1653128,ALD1CRUBY1365,B00D2D1WVI,R. L. MILLER,"[0, 0]","I ignored this cycle of films during its first run frankly because it was hyped as a downer-and-proud-of-it when I was still in mourning for the semi-comical gumshoe Thomas Magnum, he of the Ferrari and bouncing eyebrows. I'd been afraid that Selleck would do like a lot of &#34;fun actors&#34; have done when given a totally straight role and overplay it. Example--John Goodman's somewhat wooden Speaker Of the House subbing for the Prez in &#34;West Wing&#34;. But I ran into a dry period over at Netflix where everything worth watching wasn't even on disc yet and started renting the old 1950s Hitchcock suspense series while I bought this box set here to meet my movies quota. Really, if you approach this from the angle of Parker's character Jesse Stone rather than imagine Thomas Magnum at the age of his straight man co-star Higgins, you get a character as semi-dysfunctional as Eastwood's Dirty Harry but a bit less violent. It isn't always easy if you haven't read the books (which I haven't) but it can be done. I also love to picture the reactions of knee-jerk cop critics (the type who are in denial because they don't use the word &#34;pig&#34;) when they see the occasional scene where Jesse bluntly and calmly threatens a suspect he doesn't have enough evidence on to arrest yet. They all start with a phone conversation with Stone's &#34;let's part as friends&#34; ex-wife (does the actress playing her qualify as a &#34;voice-over&#34; like Don Pardo?) and somewhere along the way he has his visits with his two shrinks--the one played by William Devane and Dr. Johnnie Walker Red, who makes evening house calls. Now that I already have the complete &#34;Magnum&#34; series--as well as having just added this box--all I have to do now is wait until &#34;Blue Bloods&#34; runs its course into box set status and my collection will include The Three Ages Of Selleck. The hat's even useful as an off-season substitute for my usual Yankees hats (which sometime get me told that I'm a bit old to be a 50-Cent fan).",4,"Selleck's ""Mid Life Crisis""?

The contemplative tone where ostensibly little is happening (except volumes are being communicated), is a brave approach to take and I salute the filmmakers for so doing.

Many scenes tell the story visually, in the purest way. Proof that less is more and that the adornments of skakey cam and other mere flourishes don't add much in the final bargain.
