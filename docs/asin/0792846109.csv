Could Diane Keaton be any cuter?! She is such a natural and talented actress. I was pleasantly surprised by young Mariel Hemingway's vulnerable and very mature performance, she plays Tracy, Allen's 17 year old girlfriend in the film. I love the look on Allen's face at the end of the film (you'll know what I mean when you see it, priceless!) Manhattan explores the ups and downs of so-called committed relationships. My three top Allen films are of course Manhattan followed by Annie Hall and Hannah and Her Sisters. Manhattan is breathtaking to look at, Allen's camera angles are defintely unorthodox, especially in the numerous car scenes and in his apartment.

155120,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,0792846109,Alex Udvary,"[12, 16]","Woody Allen's &quot;Mahattan&quot; is one of the all-time great American films of the past century. It's one of Allen's best and most respected films. And I feel it has that &quot;classic&quot; Woody Allen persona. The wise-cracks, the views of New York, and his ideas on love.It's hard for me to pin point the &quot;main&quot; story-line concerning the film. To some I suppose it's about a relationship dealing with Isaac Davis (Allen) and a 17 year old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway, in an Oscar nominated performance). Others still my say it's about Yale (Michael Murphy) cheating on his wife, Emily (Anne Byrne) with Mary (Diane Keaton). Or, perhaps you feel it's the story of Isaac and Mary falling in love. And if that doesn't do it for you, we also have the story concerning Isaac and his ex wife, Jill (Meryl Streep), who left him for another woman and has now written a &quot;tell all&quot; book about their marriage. So what is &quot;Manhattan&quot; about? I guess it's about all of these things. It's about people living in the &quot;Big Apple&quot; finding and losing love. Coming to term with themselves and realizing who they are. For example, Isaac comes to realize that he really let the one girl who he loved slip away. Yale and Mary come to realize they really are in love. And Tracy goes from being a young girl to a woman, and probably the most level-headed character in the movie.&quot;Mahattan&quot; is one of those movies that whenever it's on tv I have to watch it, despite the fact that I own the movie. But, I just can't resist it. Whenever I go to New York, I have to watch this before I leave. It just puts me in the mood to go. And as soon as I come back I have to watch it again, because I miss it.If you weren't able to tell before Woody Allen loves New York and what a perfect valentine for the greatest city in the world he made. The cinematography by Gordin Willis is beautiful. It has to rank among the best of his films. It's a shame he didn't win or even get nominated for an Oscar. He really shows the city in all it's beauty. The use of Gershwin music adds to the film's more romantic moments. Think of the scene where Allen and Keaton are walking through the street and &quot;Someone To Watch Over Me&quot; plays as they sit under the bridge. You just can't beat that moment! What about the end of the movie when &quot;But Not For Me&quot; is playing and we're unsure if the two lovers will get together in the end?For those who have never watched a Woody Allen, this is a great place to start. I think of this movie as the &quot;sister&quot; of &quot;Annie Hall&quot;. Two of the most charming romantic comedies of all-time. I really love this movie and I'm glad to see so many others do as well. I hope people who come to watch this in the future will appreciate it as much as I do.Bottom-line: One of Woody Allen's best films. Made durning a time most people feel Allen was at his peek, the 70's.

If one were to name the person who represented the essence of middle/high brow New York in the 1970's and 80's the name Woody Allen would top most lists. The theme, as usual in an Allen film, is about the endlessly tangled interpersonal relationships among and between the upwardly mobile, or at least wannabe upward mobile, intellectual set in 1970's New York. An added twist, given later developments in Allen's personal life, is his tangled romance with a teenaged Waspish type (played by Hemingway), a type that he is seemingly fatally attracted to.  Some of the wit may seem dated as it relates to 1970's New York; some of Allen's physical mannerisms seem very familiar and for those who have seen his later work the theme has been done better but here is Allen in his city.

As for the story, it's another convoluted Woody Allen piece, where the characters likely think too much for their own good.Allen plays a writer struggling with, among other things, abandoning his job with a TV show that's just not funny, his girlfriend who's still in high school and his lesbian ex-wife's new tell-all book about their marriage. Things get more complicated when he finds out that his best friend has recently taken up an extramarital affair with a completely unbearable woman, played by Diane Keaton. Of course, Allen discovers over time that she might not be that bad.This is the film which showed that Allen was capable of more than one truly great piece of serious cinema.And with Meryl Streep and Mariel Hemingway turning in winning roles on top of all that, you'll quickly find yourself in love with this movie.",5,The best Woody Allen film.

It is a small arthaus type of movie but speaks to viewers at many levels. Thematically, it is a predecessor of Hannah and Her Sisters. Allen's Isaac Davis fully captures our sympathy as he is completely indecisive about so much that is important in life despite having so many trappings of success. His only decisive act is to quit his job which then results...in his feeling more despair. His relationship with Mariel Hemingway foreshadows Woody's eventual marriage to his step-daughter along with a crucial subplot of Husbands and Wives.

155134,A20IIR0422G3A5,0792846109,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[2, 3]","`Manhattan', directed by Woody Allen and written by Allen with `Annie Hall' collaborator, Marshall Brickman has, since the moment I first saw it, been my favorite Woody Allen movie. Because I saw it before I saw `Annie Hall', I did not appreciate why the earlier movie garnered so much more attention than `Manhattan'. Even though `Annie Hall' has several gimmicky flashbacks and Marshall McCluhan moments, it is still obviously a major step towards a realistic plot and characters we care about, away from the contrivances of `Sleeper', `Love and Death', `Bananas' and other early movies.`Manhattan' completes the separation from the gimmicks, easy jokes, and post-mortem speeches. While some of these devices may come back, especially with a very serious twist in `Stardust Memories' and with a refreshed inspiration in `Mighty Aphrodite', `Manhattan' is entirely realistic, with the jokes securely embedded in the situation at the moment and with characters for which one can really sympathize. The movie may also be more secure in itself with its black and white wide screen filming thanks to the `Annie Hall' Academy Award which gave Allen much greater clout in making the movie to fully fit his artistic vision.The movie is so powerful and so real that if it were not for the great artistry with which the film was made, it may be, like Terry Gillian's `Brazil', almost too painful to watch, as we really don't enjoy seeing the four major characters go through some of the emotional turmoil played out in the course of the story.The DVD liner notes say that the movie was inspired by Allen's listening to a recording of George Gershwin's overtures to his musical plays. While this is not the first movie in which the selection of music is an essential part of the story, it is certainly one of the most effective. It is also the one, obviously, in which the city of New York and surrounding towns such as Nyack play an important part of the `look and feel' of the movie. For people who are familiar with New York City, you see constant `quotes' in scenes at Zabars, in Greenwich Village, by Gramercy Park, the Museum of Natural History, the Guggenheim museum, Nyack antique stores, the wharf by the Hudson in Nyack, and Scribners book store, not to mention the great skyline, for which Allen has the good taste to use lesser landmarks such as the 59th street bridge and Third Avenue skyscrapers rather than doting on the Brooklyn Bridge and the Empire State Building. For really savvy New Yorkers, there is also a cameo appearance of Bella Abzug as the featured speaker at a fund-raiser for the equal rights amendment at the Museum of Modern Art.Allen's evolving repertoire company is well represented here, with a small part for Wallace Shawn and leading lady heavy lifting going to Diane Keaton. `M.A.S.H.' alumnus Michael Murphy takes the best buddy role usually played by Tony Roberts. Mariel Hemingway and Meryl Streep play the two other important women in the story. Streep plays a role that is almost identical to her part in the Academy Award winning movie `Kramer versus Kramer'. Hemingway actually plays the more important role as the primary love interest to Allen's character, Isaac Davis.This movie is chocked full of little pleasures. It is so great to be with, however vicariously, people who speak intelligently about cultural figures and issues. Being without this kind of stimulating conversation can leave one almost as desolate as being without love, which is one of the primary themes of the movie. This is just one of the things which make the characters so real to me. Like many of Allen's other middle and later movies, his character is not a `loser'. He is really a very successful comic TV script writer with some unfortunate moments of impracticality, as when he quits his obviously high paying job at the TV studio. He also happens to be relatively successful in charming women. His former wife (Streep) didn't leave him for another man, but for another woman. Murphy plays a highly respected teacher and writer. Keaton plays a talented book editor. Streep's vocation is not as well defined, but she is capable of writing a book that is immediately published, promoted heavily in book stores, and is seriously considered as the basis of a Hollywood movie. Hemingway is a serious student of acting who is given a scholarship to study Shakespearean acting in London. These are people you can take seriously.Behind the great city, the delightful Gershwin music, the erudite, well-acted characters, and the jokes, is a tragedy. Isaac Singer, successful screenwriter and adored boyfriend of the drop dead gorgeous Mariel Hemingway, is skewered by his ex-wife's best-selling book, looses his job over a fit of intellectual integrity, drops Hemingway for the older mistress of his married friend, looses his new girlfriend who returns to teacher, gets blamed for this affair by teacher's wife, and looses his chance for reconciliation with Hemingway who is on her way to London. Not quite `Romeo and Juliet', but then Shakespeare didn't have to compete with Manhatten as a stage.One can analyze this movie further, but I will leave it with the statement that I think it is a really important landmark in Allen's career, which I have always found even more interesting than my other favorite directors such as Stanley Kubrick. Almost all of Allen's movies seem to be cut from the same cloth, with a great continuity of topics, actors, crew, style, and level of achievement.Even if you are not a Woody Allen fan, this is an important movie achievement.",5,One of Allen's best.

While this music was created for productions other than ""Manhattan"", it is about the best thing going for this film.  In this Allen vehicle, he is romantically involved with three characters played by Meryl Streep, Diane Keaton and Mariel Hemingway.  It seems implausable that a middle-aged nerdy Allen could attract women of such beauty, especially considering that one character is only 17 years old.  Yet supposedly this Hemingway character is based on one of Allen's real life experiences.  And Allen, for a brief time, was romantically involved with Keaton.The film is talky, and when Allen is not talking he is annoyingly coughing or clearing his throat.  The dialogue seems faux intellectual.  Allen says he intended ""Manhattan"" to be a ""metaphor for everything wrong with our culture,"" and an exploration of the problem of trying to live an ethical life in a city he says is ""desensitized by television, drugs, fast food chains, loud music and feelingless, mechanical sex.""

He is married but having an affair with Mary, played by Diane Keaton. Mary is very different from Annie Hall.  There is nothing goofy about her.  she is sophisticated, brittle, smart, good looking and deeply neurotic.  allen would later use judy davis in similar roles in later films. when yale breaks up with mary, this throws all relationships into chaos, including the mariel hemingway one as allen's character becomes besotted with Mary (keaton).this film has some of the best comedy in allen's films.  everything from ""having one mother is enough"", to ""every climax is right on the money"", to a dabate of art works in the museum, to the psychiatrist taking an overdose and being in a coma, and on and on.  the comedy continues with his ex-wife, played by meryl streep, who left him for a woman to Mary's ""devastating, lady killer ex husband"" who turns out to be rotund and bald wally shawn.the whole film is set to gershwin music and the photography of manhattan is stunning.",5,gorgeous black and white follow up to Annie Hall,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,2108,"['film', 'meld', 'comedy', 'bittersweetness', 'relationships', 'men', 'women', 'relationships', 'here', 'are', 'more', 'complex.at', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'not', 'much', 'was', 'made', 'allen', 'character', 'early', 'forties', 'romancing', 'sleeping', '17', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'senior', 'high', 'school', 'played', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'present', 'day', 'tolerance', 'thing', 'past', 'people', 'see', 'allen', 'pervert', 'using', 'film', 'criticism', 'exploded', 'when', 'took', 'up', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'Soon-Yi', 'real', 'life', 'regardless', 'how', 'one', 'real', 'life', 'issue', 'masterful', 'exposition', 'older', 'man', 'fascination', 'innocence', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'becoming', 'woman', 'phenomenon', 'occurred', 'planet', 'recorded', 'time', 'so', 'was', 'not', 'unique', 'allen', 'film.the', 'above', 'major', 'portion', 'film', 'established', 'mariel', 'hemingway', 'actress.but', 'lot', 'more', 'going', 'film', 'adultery', 'other', 'major', 'motif', 'allen', 'character', 'best', 'friend', 'Yale', 'played', 'Michael', 'Murphy', 'married', 'having', 'affair', 'Mary', 'played', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Mary', 'very', 'different', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'nothing', 'goofy', 'sophisticated', 'brittle', 'smart', 'good', 'looking', 'deeply', 'neurotic', 'allen', 'would', 'later', 'use', 'judy', 'davis', 'similar', 'roles', 'later', 'films', 'when', 'yale', 'up', 'mary', 'relationships', 'chaos', 'including', 'mariel', 'hemingway', 'one', 'allen', 'character', 'besotted', 'Mary', 'keaton', '.this', 'film', 'best', 'comedy', 'allen', 'films', 'everything', 'having', 'one', 'mother', 'enough', 'climax', 'right', 'money', 'dabate', 'art', 'works', 'museum', 'psychiatrist', 'taking', 'overdose', 'being', 'coma', 'comedy', 'ex-wife', 'played', 'meryl', 'streep', 'who', 'left', 'woman', 'Mary', 'devastating', 'lady', 'killer', 'ex', 'husband', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'rotund', 'bald', 'wally', 'shawn.the', 'whole', 'film', 'set', 'gershwin', 'music', 'photography', 'manhattan', 'stunning']",N/A

155143,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,0792846109,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[12, 14]","There's poetry in Manhattan, the poetry of opposites.  As Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue plays over lusciously composed black and white images of an idyllic Manhattan, we see picture postcards shots of Broadway, 42nd Street, Central Park, the Skyline and fireworks. Fireworks we almost wish would burst the film into color.  It won't.  This is a film about  opposites, black and white or at least inconsistencies.It's a film about 42 year old Isaac, (Woody Allen)and his small circle of friends. He's a successful television writer, who's been divorced twice.  Isaac  is having a fling with 17 year old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway).  Isaac continually reminds her their relationship is temporary.  When she talks about being in love with him, he tells her to not get hung up, she's too young, there's too much life for her experience, she has to go to school in London without him in the near future.Isaac hates his job.  Hates writing the junk he is writing just to earn a paycheck and support his comfortable lifestyle.  He quits to get serious about the novel he's always wanted to write. He's having a bit of trouble finding his writing voice, just as he's having trouble finding balance in his life.  Quitting his job however means he'll have to cut-back his lifestyle and even move into an apartment with noisy neighbors and brown water.  Isaac's ex-wife (Meryl Streep) is about to publish a sure to be devastatingly personal book about their marriage.  It ended when his wife left him for another woman and Isaac tried to run over her girlfriend with his car.  They have a son and on visiting days old wounds are re-opened.  His best friend Yale,  (Michael Murphy) who is happily married, is nevertheless having an affair with Mary (Dianne Keaton). When Isaac first meets Mary, he hates her. She represents the type of Radcliff  pseudo- intellectual who can't properly pronounce Van Gogh that he detests.  But opposites do  attract.  They become friends but Isaac does not make a pass at his best friend's mistress.Yale decides to stop cheating on his wife, and suggests to Isaac that he should date Mary.These people operate in a world of shadows and illusions.  They are all false fronts.  Their self confidences, their cleverness and wit are all a facade hiding how scared, alone and vulnerable they really are.  And this is not a film where suddenly they open up and reveal themselves or transform into better people.  These are characters who have become a part of the city, of Manhattan, and a part of each others lives.Gordon Willis photography is part of this charade.  In one of the later montages, a romantic montage of shots is given an edge, partially by the greyness of the images (not merely black and white) and partially because cliche's are used and turned inside out.  During the  cliched Central Park boat row boat ride (an homage to Horsefeathers perhaps),  Isaac reaches into the water and removes his hand which is now covered with sludge.  At the Hayden planetarium it's so dark we see Isaac and Mary in silhouette.  A shot in Mary's apartment is lit seemingly by a small table lamp.Allen's cynicism and skepticism have never been as sharply realized than in this film.  There are no slapstick sequences, and no dream sequences in this -- Allen's most assured, mature and personal of films.There are plenty of laugh out loud lines of dialogue (courtesy of Allen and Marshall Brickman), but they seem natural, and never forced.  This is a confident, relaxed Allen.  He's not trying to please the audience as he did with Annie Hall.  He's not making compromises with his material so he can sell a few more tickets at the box-office.All of the actors are perfectly cast and at their peak.  Even small supporting roles, like Wallace Shawn and Michael O'Donoghue are wonderful. Look fast at the t.v. show for David Rasche and Karen Allen (in a blonde wig).

In fact the cassette deck is so extraordinary a tool at the time that it overflows the big screen, as does the bridge, as it does ten years later inThe Thin Blue Line, in a dramatic, fascinating diagonal shot which overwhelms the material.Warning:This is 1979.People were still influenced by early imprintings of Bogey and Bacall, and drinking and smoking tobacco cigarettes was still considered romantic by the older generation, as mocked in the first scene. Indoor smoking was not yet a crime in New York City.Warning:This is 1979.People are not yet epidemically overweight.A 42 year old man might conceivably however improbably have a seventeen year old girlfriend, with only a laughing reference to the police. In fact this is the most improbable (and repugnant) device of the film, which closes with the young girl counseling her elder, she the wiser now.Warning:This movie best seen upon the big screen for the awe-inspiring visuals backed by the Gershwin score. The dialogue and characters only echo the emptiness of the times, the ""negative capabilities.""It is a love story for the island itself of its day, never to be so dramatically depicted again, never before since Kong scaled the Empire State, despite the other New York films from this auteur.Warning: The story line here might best be described as Mr. Allen still in the grips of Bergman, not yet fully finding his own voice. This script may best be described as practice for writing, or a first draft for writing, the overlooked yet remarkableAlice, in which Mia Farrow plays the Woody Allen role. Get that instead; it stands up far better on the small flat screen, and includes an intriguing glimpse of Catholic theology and morality. Here Catholics are only noted in passing for their alleged life-long commitment.This movie is highly recommended to those who need to see Manhattan once more, as it was thirty years ago, as it was inhabited by an empty headed intellectual elite, who fight over a woman with screams of intellectual angst and empty universal philosophical principles.As always the best scene is the cameo with Mr. Wallace Shawn, he ofMy Dinner with Andreof his moving monologueThe Feverand his loveable yet tyrannic appearance inToy Story (10th Anniversary Edition).Get it. The best bit is the accurate send up of US televised ""comedy"" which Allen's character truly lambastes for the horror which it is, saying something like ""You guys are all on drugs; no wonder you find it funny.""

Not only are the characters in this film prime examples of that selfish bevy but I can't see Manhattan appealing to anyone other than those who either make up that mindset or else wish to study it. Let's be honest, most people are sheep, and if they're told something is  masterpiece of art or literature or cinema, they believe it and cling to that belief with mastiff-like tenacity. I suspect that explains much about Woody Allen's alleged magnum opus, Manhattan.I guess I'm having trouble seeing this film as a masterpiece. It was all right, I don't regret investing the time to see it, but a masterpiece? Many people cite the brilliance of its opening few minutes, but why does Woody Allen get credit for that when George Gershwin wrote the music, and the skyline of Manhattan was created by other people? Yes, adoring Woody Allen fans, I'm saying it: the filming of the scenery set to Rhapsody in Blue could as easily have been done by an educated media arts student. As for the plot, well, it was thin and seemed badly dated to my twenty-something sensibilities. Pampered pseudo-intellectuals ""tawking"" endlessly about how convoluted their amoral lives are? Sorry, that's been done and done and done, and for that matter, done better. And then there's the ethics of it all wherein a man teetering on the brink of post-middle age serially commits the statutory rape of a high school girl. Oh, I forgot, that's somehow avant-garde. Gee, I bet his lawyers loved that storyline back when the accusations of child molestation were flying, huh?Yes, I know, I'm being a little mean here. Woody Allen is a witty soul who has given us a number of fine movies (about one film in six he's made) and since movie appreciation isn't the inarguable exactitude of mathematics, then appreciation others believe they have for this movie is valid in their own minds. I just can't see it...Okay, fire away. I've got on my Kevlar dress...

155147,A39AKB7OM66L44,0792846109,Darnell R. Johnson,"[9, 10]","Most people have a love/hate relationship with their hometown. Only Woody Allen has put his relationship on film and set it to the music of George Gershwin. In his 1979 release ""Manhattan,"" Allen stars as Isaac Davis, a writer who's watching his life fall apart. He writes for a TV show, but quits over the the quality of the skits. His ex-wife, Jill (Meryl Streep, who won an Oscar that year for ""Kramer Vs. Kramer""), who left Isaac for another woman, has written a tell-all book about their marriage that is very unflattering to Isaac. The 42-year-old Isaac is involved with Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), who's 25 years his junior, yet shares his tastes and says she thinks she loves him. Isaac constantly discourages this talk, even though Tracy wants him to live with her in London, where she's planning to study once she turns eighteen.His best friend, a teacher and writer named Yale (Michael Murphy, who co-starred with Allen in ""The Front""), is having a secret affair with another writer, Mary Wilke (Diane Keaton). Mary, though, wants to know if Yale will choose her or his wife, Emily (Anne Byrne). On a restless Sunday where Yale is away with Emily, Mary gets Isaac to go out with her, though nothing intimate happens. Later, Yale breaks up with Mary, who turns to Isaac, even though Isaac is constantly perplexed by Mary's tastes and attitudes (""I'm from Philadelphia. We believe in God,"" is one of Mary's statements). Isaac wants what he cannot get - the upper hand in a relationship.""Manhattan"" is a wonderful study of parallels and contradictions, as well as a funny and insightful look at the ""Me Generation"" of the seventies. Both Isaac and Yale have great soulmates, yet they want something else. Both seem destined to create heartbreak for themselves and for their loved ones, even though the twice-divorced Isaac tells Tracy at one point, ""People should mate for life, like pigeons and Catholics."" Just like Mary wants to impose her intellectual standards on everyone, Isaac wants to impose his way of living on both Tracy and Jill. Isaac describes Manhattan as his metaphor for a decaying culture and lowering of intellectual standards, yet he cannot imagine living anywhere else. Like ""Annie Hall,"" we see a man looking at life, love, and relationships, yet still grasping to learn from his mistakes. ""Manhattan,"" though, is more present tense and more serious than ""Annie Hall.""The late seventies marked a period of great growth for Allen as an artist. In the drama ""The Front,"" he showed he could integrate his screen persona with somebody else's words. In ""Interiors,"" he showed he was equally capable of creating a moving, serious film of his own. ""Annie Hall"" mixes wit and wisdom as well as I've seen the two mixed. ""Manhattan"" shows Allen improving the look and the sound of his pictures. Gordon Willis creates beautiful black and white imagery, especially in the opening and closing montages. I also enjoyed the shots of Isaac and Mary at the planetarium and enjoying a sunrise. The Gershwin tunes on the soundtrack are lovingly conducted by Zubin Metha and Michael Tilson Thomas.While Allen brought in actors like Keaton and Murphy, who worked well with Allen before, he also gave Streep and Hemingway (in an Oscar-nominated performance) some great exposure early in their film careers. Streep is cold and angry as Jill, and some of it is understandable because Isaac wants to be controlling, even though they're no longer married. Jill's stares at Isaac seem to jump right out of the screen to grab attention. Hemingway comes across as the person with her head on the straightest. Tracy is sweeter and smarter than Isaac deserves. I like that Tracy knows what she wants, and repeatedly tells that to Isaac, who seems to be deaf to her arguments. Other performers have notable cameos, such as Karen Allen (""Animal House"") and David Rasche (""Sledge Hammer"") as actors on the show where Isaac works. Wallace Shawn (""My Dinner With Andre"") appears as Mary's ex-husband, Jeremiah, who is described by his ex as dominating, but comes across as anything but that. Bella Abzug, who represented New York in the seventies in Congress and was at the forefront for equal rights for women, is the guest speaker at a party attended by Isaac and Mary.As the seventies ended, so did Allen's creative partnerships with two people who helped make his films so memorable. ""Manhattan"" marked the last appearance of Keaton in an Allen film until ""Radio Days"" eight years later. Marshall Brickman, who co-wrote this film, ""Annie Hall,"" and ""Sleeper"" with him, turned to directing himself in the eighties, though none of his efforts (""Simon,"" ""Lovesick,"" and ""The Manhattan Project"") are nearly as memorable as his work with Allen. However, Brickman and Allen collaborated again on Allen's 1993 film, ""Manhattan Murder Mystery,"" which starred Allen and Keaton. It seemed like they were never really away.""Manhattan"" is a successful marriage of comedy, drama, and images of a place that has meant a great deal to Allen. The image that struck me the most in my most recent viewing of the film was the one of fireworks in the Manhattan night sky. It's a sign of happier times in a place that came under such a terrible attack. Like Isaac, Manhattan is now in a state of recovery. Someday, people will celebrate such a sight in that sky again. Until then, we have these pictures and stories that seem so far away now.",5,Rhapsody In Black And White,1020384000,"05 3, 2002",2002,5418,"['Most', 'people', 'have', 'love/hate', 'relationship',

The plot lacks humor, the characters seem cardboard, and the fact it is shot in B&W; seems an economical compromise, not at artistic choice. Worse, the central character, played by Woody, is unlikable and unsympathetic. A rather good supporting cast, including Diane Keaton, can't raise this dreck above the curbside. In fact, if you liked the classic &#34;Annie Hall,&#34; you might regard this as its evil doppelganger: unfunny, unsympathetic, uninteresting.It's beyond my comprehension why this film enjoys any reputation at all. Must be the title. I notice, the DVD menu features prominently the Statue of Liberty, which is NOT in Manhattan (and never appears in the film).The DVD: Widescreen. The only features (they ain't special) are a single trailer, and language choices (English or dubbed Spanish, Spanish or French subtitled).Disregard whatever you've heard about this film's reputation; get yourself a DVD of &#34;Annie Hall&#34; first, and &#34;Hannah and her Sisters&#34; after that.

The fact that it's black and white doesn't take away from that beauty; in Woody Allen's hands, B&W; actually adds to the beauty.Allen displays New York at its cosmopolitan height, even as the city was crumbling around him. He glories in its aging beauty, its earthy, crusty patina, its diversity and the grandeur of Manhattan and its people. Those short-sighted reviewers who choose to grade the movie based on their opinion of Allen's personal life--which they have gleened from the pages of the Weekly World News and Parade magazine--are not only missing the point of this film, they are flying in the face of the compassion and love of humanity which it evokes.Of course, that may be the way Allen would handle it if the situation were reversed. He is the personification of the old line--is it from Socrates or vaudeville?--""I love humanity; it's people I can't stand.""The story isn't as approachable as Annie Hall, and the characters aren't as warm, but MANHATTAN is still Allen at his creative peak.

155151,A35UNON2GI8C0R,0792846109,David Kusumoto,"[163, 178]","In 1979, Woody had the burden of trying to capture the ""originality"" of ""Annie Hall,"" the Oscar-winning Best Picture of 1977.So when ""Manhattan"" was released, Woody's first ""true"" widescreen picture (so much so that Woody insisted this film NEVER be released on video or shown on television without the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen), I wasn't quite sure what to expect.I discovered that ""Manhattan"" had a completely different tone than ""Annie Hall.""  It was more serious, but still hilarious.  I became so enraptured by its themes, its music and its atmosphere that I felt, until I saw ""Schindler's List"" in late 1993, that I had witnessed something that comes along only once or twice a generation...and that's true greatness on film.  I paid to see ""Manhattan"" at least four times during its initial run in 1979.  I had never done this before, even when I include those popcorn pictures I had seen several times put out by Spielberg and Lucas during the 1970s.  I found ""Manhattan"" simply incredible, so ""on the mark,"" so revelatory about the weaknesses of people, especially so-called ""intelligent"" people.Rather than go over the plot, I believe ""Manhattan's"" themes include the following:1. intellectualism is overrated.2. romance is illogical and unscientific.3. words don't always match our actions.4. moral structure is a man-made invention.5. fidelity is an optimistic ideal.6. skeletons in the closet are better left unsaid.7. uncorrupted optimism is mostly found in young people.8. cynicism increases as you grow old.9. advancing years = more unnecessary baggage.10. The more you know, the more it can hurt you.That all of the above is delivered with humor is something only Woody Allen could accomplish.There was a time when Woody's life imitated his art so closely that I had to avoid this SPECIFIC film for awhile. But now the past is past and it doesn't matter. Woody's art remains and the messages in ""Manhattan"" haven't been diminished after so many years.  It still holds up even though it was made during the late 1970s.Yes, Woody Allen's films are an acquired taste. People won't admit it, but when you pin down WHY they don't like ""Manhattan"" or anything he does, you find the reasons are rooted in conventional moral judgments, religious intolerance or even genetic issues such as his ""whiny"" voice and the fact he is one of the most un-photogenic actor-director-writers of our time (e.g., no one likes watching Woody ""kiss"" any woman on screen.)And when art becomes too closely reflective of an artist's life, it can make people uncomfortable.  My response is if you are unable to separate an artist's personal life or lifestyle from his work, sometimes the world can be made the lesser for it.""Manhattan"" and ""Annie Hall"" remain the benchmarks of all urban-based, non-screwball comedies made in America. That Woody was able to ""re-invent,"" or more to the point -- to ""invent"" a new genre of comedy -- is more evident today by looking at everything that has come since 1979 that is clearly derivative from these two landmark urban films.Only elitist thinkers will call people who don't ""get"" this film ""fools."" They're not.  Again, Woody's films are an acquired taste. Fans who have followed him forever, quite candidly, like the way he is on screen, even if it's the same nebbish, over-analytical character every time.  We're comfortable with him in the same and opposite way that we didn't mind Cary Grant playing Cary Grant all of the time.  Nobody delivers a punch line or joke better than Woody and when he's not in his own films, they don't seem as funny.""Manhattan,"" in my opinion, is the finest of Woody's ""quartet"" of masterpieces (the others are ""Annie Hall, Hannah and Her Sisters"" and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors""). There is so much hilarity and truth woven into this picture, complimented by a glorious Gershwin score and wonderful black and white cinematography, that I'm 100 percent sure -- that Woody will never be able to top this film -- even if he lives to 100.The end ""smirk"" on his face speaks volumes about what's going on in this story, and why, unlike most of Hollywood's ""mainstream"" comedies, he won't give you the standard cornball ending.Yet what he leaves behind as the credits roll, still leaves you satisfied.  There isn't anything left hanging, in my mind, since you already know that Woody's character KNOWS how everything is going to end.  That's the reason for the ""smirk.""How many filmmakers can get away with this and stay original?This is Woody's greatest film and it remains undated after more than 30 years...",5,"More Than 30 Years Later, Still Woody's True Masterpiece",1005696000,"11 14, 2001",2001,4586,"['1979', 'Woody', 'had', 'burden', 'trying', 'capture', 'originality', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Oscar-winning', 'Best', 'Picture', '1977.So', 'when', 'Manhattan', 'was', 'released', 'Woody', 'first', 'true', 'widescreen', 'picture', 'so', 'much', 'Woody', 'insisted', 'film', 'NEVER', 'be', 'released', 'video', 'shown', 'television', 'black', 'bars', 'top', 'bottom', 'screen', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'expect.I', 'discovered', 'Manhattan', 'had', 'completely', 'different', 'tone', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'was', 'more', 'serious', 'still', 'hilarious', 'became', 'so', 'enraptured', 'themes', 'music', 'atmosphere', 'felt', 'saw', 'Schindler', 'List', 'late', '1993', 'had', 'witnessed', 'something', 'only', 'once', 'twice', 'generation', 'true', 'greatness', 'film', 'paid', 'see', 'Manhattan', 'least', 'four', 'times', 'initial', 'run', '1979', 'had', 'never', 'done', 'even', 'when', 'include', 'popcorn', 'pictures', 'had', 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'put', 'out', 'Spielberg', 'Lucas', '1970s', 'found', 'Manhattan', 'simply', 'incredible', 'mark', 'so', 'revelatory', 'weaknesses', 'people', 'especially', 'so-called', 'intelligent', 'people.Rather', 'go', 'plot', 'believe', 'Manhattan', 'themes', 'include', 'following:1.', 'intellectualism', 'overrated.2', 'romance', 'illogical', 'unscientific.3', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'match', 'actions.4', 'moral', 'structure', 'man-made', 'invention.5', 'fidelity', 'optimistic', 'ideal.6', 'skeletons', 'closet', 'are', 'better', 'left', 'unsaid.7', 'uncorrupted', 'optimism', 'mostly', 'found', 'young', 'people.8', 'cynicism', 'grow', 'old.9', 'advancing', 'years', '=', 'more', 'unnecessary', 'baggage.10', 'more', 'know', 'more', 'can', 'hurt', 'above', 'delivered', 'humor', 'something', 'only', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'could', 'accomplish.There', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'Woody', 'life', 'imitated', 'art', 'so', 'closely', 'had', 'avoid', 'SPECIFIC', 'film', 'awhile', 'now', 'past', 'past', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Woody', 'art', 'messages', 'Manhattan', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'diminished', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'still', 'up', 'even', 'was', 'made', 'late', '1970s.Yes', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'are', 'acquired', 'taste', 'People', 'wo', ""n't"", 'admit', 'when', 'pin', 'down', 'WHY', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Manhattan', 'anything', 'find', 'reasons', 'are', 'rooted', 'conventional', 'moral', 'judgments', 'religious', 'intolerance', 'even', 'genetic', 'issues', 'such', 'whiny', 'voice', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'un-photogenic', 'actor-director-writers', 'time', 'e.g.', 'one', 'watching', 'Woody', 'kiss', 'woman', 'screen', 'when', 'art', 'too', 'closely', 'reflective', 'artist', 'life', 'can', 'make', 'people', 'uncomfortable', 'response', 'are', 'unable', 'separate', 'artist', 'personal', 'life', 'lifestyle', 'work', 'sometimes', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'lesser', 'Manhattan', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'remain', 'benchmarks', 'urban-based', 'non-screwball', 'comedies', 'made', 'America', 'Woody', 'was', 'able', 're-invent', 'more', 'point', 'invent', 'new', 'genre', 'comedy', 'more', 'evident', 'today', 'looking', 'everything', 'come', '1979', 'clearly', 'derivative', 'two', 'landmark', 'urban', 'films.Only', 'elitist', 'thinkers', 'will', 'call', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'film', 'fools', ""'re"", 'not', 'Again', 'Woody', 'films', 'are', 'acquired', 'taste', 'Fans', 'who', 'have', 'followed', 'forever', 'quite', 'candidly', 'way', 'screen', 'even', 'same', 'nebbish', 'over-analytical', 'character', 'time', ""'re"", 'comfortable', 'same', 'opposite', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'playing', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'time', 'Nobody', 'punch', 'line', 'joke', 'better', 'Woody', 'when', 'not', 'own', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'funny', 'Manhattan', 'opinion', 'finest', 'Woody', 'quartet', 'masterpieces', 'others', 'are', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Hannah', 'Sisters', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'so', 'much', 'hilarity', 'truth', 'woven', 'picture', 'complimented', 'glorious', 'Gershwin', 'score', 'wonderful', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', ""'m"", '100', 'percent', 'sure', 'Woody', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'top', 'film', 'even', '100.The', 'end', 'smirk', 'face', 'volumes', 'what', 'going', 'story', 'why', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'mainstream', 'comedies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'standard', 'cornball', 'what', 'credits', 'roll', 'still', 'satisfied', ""n't"", 'anything', 'left', 'hanging', 'mind', 'already', 'know', 'Woody', 'character', 'KNOWS', 'how', 'everything', 'going', 'end', 'reason', 'smirk', 'How', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'stay', 'original', 'Woody', 'greatest', 'film', 'undated', 'more', '30', 'years']",N/A

Gershwin music continues to be woven throughout the movie, played by an orchestra conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas. Oh, and the movie itself? Woody has always had an eye for talented actors to populate his movies, often well ahead of their wider acclamation. In this case we have Meryl Streep in an early movie of hers, playing Woody's estranged wife who has run off with another woman; Mariel Hemmingway as his new, much younger love interest and Michael Murphy. It is a well-constructed story about relationships. The lines are memorable. For example, Woody is talking about his pre-teen son with whom he has visiting rights and the son's mother being in a lesbian relationship, ""Most people have trouble surviving one mother, let alone two."" Woody when in bed with 18-YO Mariel Hemmingway responds when she says, ""I like making love a lot"", with, ""A lot is my favourite number!""

155155,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0792846109,Ed Uyeshima,"[7, 7]","Perhaps a quarter-century is enough to overlook the unavoidable prescience of this 1979 social dramedy in depicting Woody Allen's future relationship with and marriage to 35-years younger Soon-Yi Previn. I hope so because viewing it for the first time since its original release, I think it's probably still his most mature and romantic film. Neither as hilariously quirky as ""Annie Hall"" nor as expansive in perspective as ""Hannah and Her Sisters"", this film focuses almost exclusively on the degrees of human fallibility in its central characters, almost all of whom are writers and consequently acute, sometimes pretentious observers of the life around them.Allen portrays Isaac Davis, a neurotic but successful TV writer who at 42, has soured on love after two failed marriages. Almost in emotional retaliation, he has taken up with Tracy, a seventeen-year old high school student. She is a calming influence but one he refuses to take seriously given her tender years. Isaac's frustrated best friend Yale, married twelve years to Emily, has been having an affair with an irritatingly self-absorbed editor named Mary. Realizing the relationship cannot go anywhere, Mary breaks it off and finds herself drawn to Isaac. Concurrently caught in an unexpected career change, Isaac starts to face realities about his own emotional state, and complications ensue in a most resonant manner. In fact, the last five minutes are the most achingly romantic that Allen has put on film.What remains impressive about this true masterwork is the unbeatable combination of the clever, penetrating script by Allen and Marshall Brickman (reunited from ""Annie Hall""), the grandly orchestrated Gershwin pieces as a musical chorus and the astonishing black-and-white cinematography of Gordon Willis. As usual for an Allen film, the performances are uniformly accomplished. In something of an about-face from the lovable Annie, Diane Keaton unapologetically brings out the sharp intellect and brittle neurosis of Mary in crisp detail. Michael Murphy plays a variation of his cheating husband in ""An Unmarried Woman"" but with far greater depth as Yale. In her breakout year, Meryl Streep, looking austerely beautiful with her long blonde hair cast to one side, has three incisive scenes as Isaac's ex-wife Jill, who has since embarked on a lesbian relationship and writes a tell-all book about their marriage.Ironically, Anne Byrne was just about to go through her own public divorce from Dustin Hoffman when she played Emily at the time. Even Allen manages a few moments of poignancy that transcend Isaac's constant angst. But the jewel of the cast is Mariel Hemingway, who plays Tracy with such a beguiling blend of maturity and naivet&eacute;. As it turns out, her character is the only one who is emotionally available and honest about her feelings. This is still a splendid work, and if you can get past the life-imitating-art-imitating-life analogies, this one will stay with you. And Manhattan never looked better.

155156,A1XPIXEIB0QXCM,0792846109,El Rey Lin,"[10, 17]","I just re-watched this movie recently. I loved it in college, and thought Woody was a genius. The dialogue and story are still great, the cinematography is beautiful, and New York City shines as a majestic, romantic city. Woody's depiction of the neurotic intellectual elite crowd in Manhattan is entertaining and hilarious.But today I see something sinister here that I didn't twenty years ago. Maybe it has to do with the whole twisted Soon Yi-Mia business that happened in the subsequent years. Maybe it's because now that I'm the age of Ike Davis, I realize how screwed up it is for a guy in his forties to be dating a high school student. Maybe now that I have daughters of my own, I know I'd never want them to get involved with a 42 year-old guy when they were still wearing braces.Strip away the learned banter about Kafka and Bergman, the great black and white shots of the city, the wry, pithy remarks from Ike, and this movie essentially glorifies and presents as healthy what is legally considered statutory rape. If you want to be really blunt about it, you might say that this movie is a pedophile's fantasy.Ike Davis's manipulation and mistreatment of Tracy is presented as not such a bad thing.  Tracy, the pure, sweet, yet sexually wild nymphet (the pedophile's fantasy, indeed) accepts it all, and remains loyal to her 42 year-old man. Ike's constant complaints to his friends about how he realizes Tracy is too young and how he has to get out of the relationship are supposed to show that he's not some predatory sicko but a normal guy who shares the audience's moral perspective.Yet he ultimately discards any concerns he has about the propriety of his relationship with Tracy. He concludes that his relationship with Tracy is the best one he's ever had with a ""woman"" and wants her to cancel her 6-month trip to London so she can get back together with him. She tells Ike that had he come to her a week earlier, she might have considered it. But not to worry, says Tracy: ""What's six months if we both love each other?"". Despite Ike having cheated on her, dumped her, and repeatedly told her that he's unwilling to commit to her, Tracy still regards him as her true love.So again, it's the pedophile's fantasy: this isn't an abusive, inappropriate relationship--it's true love! Ike's mistreatment of Tracy and taking advantage of her childlike navet&eacute; is not morally wrong--see, she still loves him and wants more! The best partner for a 42 year-old accomplished intellectual man is not an accomplished intellectual woman the same age like Diane Keaton's character--no, it's a girl in high school!I read an article in the NY Times recently about how, given the increased awareness of sexual abuse of children that has emerged since 1979, a movie like Manhattan could never get made today. That's probably not such a bad thing. Back in the 80s, I read a glowing review of Manhattan that talked about Ike Davis's smile in the final scene when Tracy tells him he has to have a little more faith in people. That smile was so profound, said the reviewer, the perfect expression of the complex emotions in the lives of these elite intellectual New Yorkers. I agreed with the reviewer 20 years ago. But when I re-watched the movie the other day, all I could think was that if it was my daughter this guy was preying on, if I saw that smile I'd want to get him locked up.",4,A Pedophile's Fantasy,1260835200,"12 15, 2009",2009,3390,"['just', 're-watched', 'movie', 'recently', 'loved', 'college', 'thought', 'Woody', 'was', 'genius', 'dialogue', 'story', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'shines', 'majestic', 'romantic', 'city', 'Woody', 'depiction', 'neurotic', 'intellectual', 'elite', 'crowd', 'Manhattan', 'entertaining', 'hilarious.But', 'today', 'see', 'something', 'sinister', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'Maybe', 'do', 'whole', 'twisted', 'Soon', 'Yi-Mia', 'business', 'happened', 'subsequent', 'years', 'Maybe', 'because', 'now', ""'m"", 'age', 'Ike', 'Davis', 'realize', 'how', 'screwed', 'guy', 'forties', 'be', 'dating', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Maybe', 'now', 'have', 'daughters', 'own', 'know', ""'d"", 'never', 'want', 'get', 'involved', '42', 'year-old', 'guy', 'when', 'were', 'still', 'wearing', 'braces.Strip', 'away', 'learned', 'banter', 'Kafka', 'Bergman', 'great', 'black', 'white', 'shots', 'city', 'wry', 'pithy', 'remarks', 'Ike', 'movie', 'essentially', 'glorifies', 'presents', 'healthy', 'what', 'legally', 'considered', 'statutory', 'rape', 'want', 'be', 'really', 'blunt', 'might', 'say', 'movie', 'pedophile', 'fantasy.Ike', 'Davis', 'manipulation', 'mistreatment', 'Tracy', 'presented', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'Tracy', 'pure', 'sweet', 'yet', 'sexually', 'wild', 'nymphet', 'pedophile', 'fantasy', 'indeed', 'loyal', '42', 'year-old', 'man', 'Ike', 'constant', 'complaints', 'friends', 'how', 'Tracy', 'too', 'young', 'how', 'get', 'relationship', 'are', 'supposed', 'show', 'not', 'predatory', 'sicko', 'normal', 'guy', 'who', 'shares', 'audience', 'moral', 'perspective.Yet', 'ultimately', 'concerns', 'propriety', 'relationship', 'Tracy', 'relationship', 'Tracy', 'best', 'one', 'ever', 'had', 'woman', 'cancel', '6-month', 'trip', 'London', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'Ike', 'had', 'come', 'week', 'earlier', 'might', 'have', 'considered', 'not', 'worry', 'Tracy', 'What', 'six', 'months', 'love', 'other', 'Ike', 'having', 'cheated', 'dumped', 'repeatedly', 'told', 'unwilling', 'commit', 'Tracy', 'still', 'true', 'love.So', 'again', 'pedophile', 'fantasy', ""n't"", 'abusive', 'inappropriate', 'relationship', 'true', 'love', 'Ike', 'mistreatment', 'Tracy', 'taking', 'advantage', 'childlike', 'navet', 'eacute', 'not', 'morally', 'wrong', 'see', 'still', 'more', 'best', 'partner', '42', 'year-old', 'accomplished', 'intellectual', 'man', 'not', 'accomplished', 'intellectual', 'woman', 'same', 'age', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'character', 'girl', 'high', 'school', 'read', 'article', 'NY', 'Times', 'recently', 'how', 'given', 'increased', 'awareness', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'children', 'emerged', '1979', 'movie', 'Manhattan', 'could', 'never', 'get', 'made', 'today', 'probably', 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'thing', 'Back', '80s', 'read', 'glowing', 'review', 'Manhattan', 'talked', 'Ike', 'Davis', 'smile', 'final', 'scene', 'when', 'Tracy', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'faith', 'people', 'smile', 'was', 'so', 'profound', 'said', 'reviewer', 'perfect', 'expression', 'complex', 'emotions', 'lives', 'elite', 'intellectual', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'agreed', 'reviewer', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 're-watched', 'movie', 'other', 'day', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'was', 'daughter', 'guy', 'was', 'preying', 'saw', 'smile', ""'d"", 'want', 'get', 'locked', 'up']",N/A

155160,A1GY4VWXY0747S,0792846109,FredCritic,"[0, 0]","First let me let me say this and then I'll explain the title I have given to this review.Although Manhattan is my all-time favorite Allen film, I would not consider it one of his better artistic accomplishments. (That list would include The Purple Rose of Cairo, Husbands and Wives, Bullets Over Broadway, Everyone Says I Love You, Match Point, and You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger.)The reason for this is that Manhattan has serious third-act problems. (For those that have not yet seen this movie, not to worry, I'm not giving anything away; it will be glaringly obvious as you make your way through the third act). Quiet simply, the third act feels as if it were dropped in from the moon. You're left wondering what in the hell it has to do with anything that preceded it in the film (i.e., the first two acts). Woody Allen has said, in interview after interview for the past several decades, that after he watched the finished product, he offered the film studio the following deal: If they would agree to burn and destroy the film, he would make another for free. Interviewer after interviewer have asked him what he doesn't like about the film and his typical response is usually something along the lines of ""I don't know, I just don't like it."" Yeah, right. See the film, folks, and tell me if it wasn't the third act that turned him against the film.-------------------------------------------------------Now, as for the title of this review. In film after film, starting with Manhattan, big time, Allen has romanticized and white-washed screwed up, neurotic women. For the past several decades, male friends and acquaintances of mine have sincerely and seriously commented that ""they like Woody's women."" And I've always thought,""Good gosh, these women are terrors...neurotic, dysfunctional or even nonfunctional, screwed up, walking time bombs. What's there to like?"" Of course, I never actually said this to their faces; I didn't want to insult them. But this is what I was thinking.But at any rate, with Blue Jasmine, for the first time Allen has avoided romanticizing and white-washing this type. In his latest film, Blue Jasmine, Allen has finally managed to portray neurotic, screwed up women (specifically, the Jasmine character) quiet similar to the neurotic, screwed up women that you run into from time to time in real life. Annoying, obnoxious, hysterical, self-absorbed, self-centered, self-destructive, trouble-making, and so on and so forth, with very few, if any, redeedming qualities. And to this I say: WHAT A TREMENDOUS RELIEF AFTER ALL OF THESE DECADES. Congratulations to Woody Allen for finally facing reality head-on.But now, my question is, is this the end of Allen's romanticizing and white-washing neurotic women, or does he go back to his old ways beginning with his next film...?We shall soon see.",4,From Manhattan up to Blue Jasmine and then pulling the 'ol switcheroo...,1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,2835,"['First', 'let', 'let', 'say', 'then', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'title', 'have', 'given', 'review.Although', 'Manhattan', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'Allen', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'consider', 'one', 'better', 'artistic', 'accomplishments', 'list', 'would', 'include', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'Husbands', 'Wives', 'Bullets', 'Over', 'Broadway', 'Everyone', 'Love', 'Match', 'Point', 'Will', 'Meet', 'Tall', 'Dark', 'Stranger', 'reason', 'Manhattan', 'serious', 'third-act', 'problems', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'movie', 'not', 'worry', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'will', 'be', 'glaringly', 'obvious', 'make', 'way', 'third', 'act', 'Quiet', 'simply', 'third', 'act', 'feels', 'were', 'dropped', 'moon', ""'re"", 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'hell', 'do', 'anything', 'preceded', 'film', 'i.e.', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'said', 'interview', 'interview', 'past', 'several', 'decades', 'watched', 'finished', 'product', 'offered', 'film', 'studio', 'following', 'deal', 'would', 'agree', 'burn', 'destroy', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'free', 'Interviewer', 'interviewer', 'have', 'asked', 'what', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'typical', 'response', 'usually', 'something', 'lines', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Yeah', 'right', 'See', 'film', 'folks', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'third', 'act', 'turned', 'film.', '-Now', 'title', 'review', 'film', 'film', 'starting', 'Manhattan', 'big', 'time', 'Allen', 'romanticized', 'white-washed', 'screwed', 'up', 'neurotic', 'women', 'past', 'several', 'decades', 'male', 'friends', 'acquaintances', 'mine', 'have', 'sincerely', 'seriously', 'commented', 'like', 'Woody', 'women', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'Good', 'gosh', 'women', 'are', 'terrors', 'neurotic', 'dysfunctional', 'even', 'nonfunctional', 'screwed', 'up', 'walking', 'time', 'bombs', 'What', 'there', 'like', 'course', 'never', 'actually', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'insult', 'what', 'was', 'thinking.But', 'rate', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', 'first', 'time', 'Allen', 'avoided', 'romanticizing', 'white-washing', 'type', 'latest', 'film', 'Blue', 'Jasmine', 'Allen', 'finally', 'managed', 'portray', 'neurotic', 'screwed', 'up', 'women', 'specifically', 'Jasmine', 'character', 'quiet', 'similar', 'neurotic', 'screwed', 'up', 'women', 'run', 'time', 'time', 'real', 'life', 'Annoying', 'obnoxious', 'hysterical', 'self-absorbed', 'self-centered', 'self-destructive', 'trouble-making', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'very', 'few', 'redeedming', 'qualities', 'say', 'WHAT', 'TREMENDOUS', 'RELIEF', 'AFTER', 'ALL', 'THESE', 'DECADES', 'Congratulations', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'finally', 'facing', 'reality', 'head-on.But', 'now', 'question', 'end', 'Allen', 'romanticizing', 'white-washing', 'neurotic', 'women', 'go', 'back', 'old', 'ways', 'beginning', 'next', 'film', 'shall', 'soon', 'see']",N/A
155161,A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4,0792846109,Gerard D. Launay,"[2, 4]","That's a line that Isaac  (Woody Allen) whispers to Mary (Diane Keaton) in the NYC planetarium as they walk between the planets and the stars on the screen.  Such an existential moment.  Alas, it seems to be the one thing that Woody Allen can articulate but not adopt - really deeply - in his soul.  We know him from his wisecracks about God, death, movies, intellectuals, sex...but what this film is about is nostalgia - what we remember of what we think we love.The film begins with Woody Allen exclaiming how much he loves THE CITY.  Yes, I think that is true. One theme is whether he knows how to love  something entirely different - another human being.  His characters always seem to be reaching for that goal - just out of his reach. From my experience, loving another requires unqualified unselfishness, full acceptance of the other, compassion, and a sparkle of wisdom.  Would his character offer his kidney to his wife or best friend?  One senses no.So many reviewers have praised the glorious black and white cinematography. They are right on the money. Gordon Willis did the photography for Woody Allen - and he is justly known for also doing ""The Godfather.""  The opening sequence may be one of the most sensational I have ever seen on the silver screen....nostalgic shots of Manhattan against the background of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue.  The opening concludes in a burst of light from fireworks over the city.  Orgasmic. (Gordon Willis also shot ""Stardust Memories"" for Woody Allen, one of those films that doesn't get much mention these days)It is striking to me that Woody Allen's character does not ever smile. He offers a smirk, yes, but not a smile.  That's an interesting observation about a comedian, about ""this"" comedian.  Perhaps at this time in his life, he was going through his immature mid life crisis.  That occurs when a man believes he is losing his virility, ponders growing old, and foolishly thinks he can resurrect his life by dating a young, pretty girl.  It is a risque move - as a director - to put your true flaws right into a picture, but there it is, for all to see.  A 42 year old man having an affair with a 17 year old high school student!Mariel Hemingway - the 17 year old - is a revelation.  Of all the characters, she (Tracy) speaks simply from the heart.  The others go about lamenting their relationships, criticizing themselves or their lover, but none of them really seem to be loving anyone. Other than one scene (in a horse carriage in Central Park) when Isaac says that Tracy is ""God's answer to Job"", Isaac generally does not respect Tracy as an equal. In public, he makes disparaging comments about her. And he is always warning her she is too young for him and the relationship has to self-destruct. So when Tracy finally leaves Isaac, he suddenly realizes he may indeed have lost the one love of his life. At the end of the movie, he begs her to stay.  But the deed is done; she will travel away to London.  Isaac - or Woody Allen - lost the one person in the film who really could love him back, if he had chosen to love her first.Unlike other films which are tied to their moment, the truths in this film will remain valid 10 or 100 years from now. And that's one reason it is a masterpiece.

The movie was released in 1979 and helped mark a true departure for Woody.  Gone were the days of the quick and easy comedy (but not for long), while this movie heralded a more mature Allen and dramatic endeavors.The plot is essentially about Allen as Isaac Davis, a divorced New Yorker that is dating a high schooler (an impressive Mariel Hemingway), who realises he is much more suited for his best friends girlfriend/mistress.  Allen is his usually solid self, while Karen Allen is well-cast and suited for her role.This movie is short - clocking in at under 100 minutes - and is filmed in balck and white.

I think I'm only one of the few seventeen-year-old girls on the planet that really likes Woody Allen. He is a wonderful director and actor. 'Manhattan' is plain, simple proof of that. It is indescribable. I think I'm in love with this film. I can really identify with almost all the actresses and actors, including Mariel Hemingway's character, Tracy. Being the same age as she is, I can see myself in her. I really love her strength and maturity. She's the only one that makes sense and thinks things through in the movie- the others, such as Diane Keaton's character, Mary, Michael Murphy's Yale, and Woody Allen's Issac, they all just run around blurting out unintentional things. But they really add to the effect of the movie. This movie is so wonderful on many levels. Humor, optimism, pessimism, romance, betrayal, and innocence.  I just LOVE the lines Keaton, Hemingway and Allen deliver! Two very memorable lines: &quot;I wanted to throw you down on the lunar surface and commit interstellar perversion with you.&quot; and &quot;You just got to have a little faith in people&quot;. This especially strikes your emotional chords, and the way Hemingway says it.  This is a classic love triangle, with the main character dumping his seventeen-year old girlfriend, and realizing he wants her back. Some people might find 'Manhattan' plain sick, because of the relationship between a 42-year-old man and a 17-year-old girl, but that wasn't annoying at all to me. Meryl Streep as Jill was rewarding. I'm still laughing at the details she portrayed in her book about Issac, and how Issac denies that he tried to run over Jill and her girlfriend when he first found out that they were lovers.  Keaton is wonderful. Of course, she is in all of her movies. I found her character amusing, although I was shocked at first when she decided to go back to Yale instead of staying with Issac, but when I thought about it, I realized that both Mary and Issac are both two neurotic individuals who enjoy each other at first, but after a while, their neurotism just interfere. And their first lovers, Yale and Tracy, are stable people. So, going back to their original lovers was really the right thing to do. But when they were together, they were simply wonderful. I really enjoyed the lines they threw at each other. I also love the first kiss! It's simply impossible to describe how they dredged up particular emotions.  'Manhattan' is magical. It's impossible to not appreciate its aesthetic qualities. I especially love the last scene. It combines nostalgia and finality. I love when Tracy says &quot;You just got to have a little faith in people,&quot; and Issac looks at her and this wistful, faint smile floats across his lips. It's impossible to explain what emotions 'Manhattan' delivers!I think I'll wear out my DVD version ogling this movie over and over. DON'T MISS IT!!

155181,A34D06JL7LC6MU,0792846109,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[0, 0]","To Woody Allen; Manhattan is his worst film. To many; it may be his greatest. Released at an interesting time in Woody's career, in 1979, only two years after his most mature directorial effort,Annie Hall, netted him an Oscar for Best Director. A year later, he moved from the realm of comedy to direct Interiors, a bleak drama. Manhattan effectively combines the tone of these films, with Allen saying it was ""like a mixture of what I was trying to do with Annie Hall and Interiors."" In fact, Manhattan is a more cynical, caustic take on the whimsy of Annie Hall. The films really are two sides of the same coin, even sharing the same co-screenwriter Marshall Brickman.The opening shots are iconic. Lavish, black & white photography by Gordon Willis set to Rhapsody in Blue by George Gershwin. Among other things, the film is a love letter to the city that Allen loves and this beautiful sequence of images establish New York as an ideal. Isaac Davis (Allen) is a twice-divorced television writer, currently working on a novel about his love for New York. Meanwhile he's dating a 17-year-old girl named Tracy (Mariel Hemingway). Isaac is 42. His ex-wife Jill (Meryl Streep) left him for a woman and is, much to Isaac's chagrin, working on a book about their marriage. His best friend, Yale (Michael Murphy) is married but conducting an affair with Mary Wilke (Diane Keaton). With the exception of Tracy, every character is deeply unhappy with their current state of affairs. Isaac likes Tracy but spends most of the film trying to break up with her; Yale loves Mary, but won't leave his wife; Mary doesn't want him to, because she doesn't want to be a ""home wrecker."" Of course, Isaac and Mary get involved, but this isn't a happy-go-lucky film.Manhattan straddles a fine line between drama and comedy, brilliantly balancing both. It's a cynical take on the traditional Allen film. Take the Isaac character, a far cry from Alvie Singer (or whatever Allen character you'd like to consider). The mannerisms are similar, but Isaac's attitude is more cynical, more complex, and more easily annoyed. He's not the cute, philosophical, and awkward character that Allen usually plays so well. The same can be said for Keaton's performance, which isn't as flighty as Annie Hall. Hemingway's performance is the dichotomy between the characters and she brings such tenderness to the film she received an Oscar nomination for her performance. Only 18 at the time, Hemingway plays Tracy as sweet and clear-minded, probably the most aware; the character with the most direction. It's a mature and dynamic performance that Hemingway renders heartbreakingly simple.Infidelity, sexuality, love, connections, and relationships; Manhattan has all of the themes that mirror Allen's personal obsessions, but with one more...Loss. This gives his film more insight, more complexity, into the human condition(s) that he explores and makes Manhattan one of his most profound cinematic statements. Aesthetically, it's inarguably one of Allen's most beautiful films. The shot that graces the cover is one of the most iconic images in all of film, but Willis' photography (the film was shot in 2.35:1 aspect ratio) consistently paints a beautiful portrait of New York throughout. So important is his composition that the aspect ratio was preserved for VHS releases at a time when most films were subjected to pan & scan treatment. It's a huge part of the film's grandeur and its staying power.The conclusion boasts some of Woody's strongest acting and most poignant writing. This may be Allen's best performance, but the ending especially may be the most emotionally striking climax of any film he's directed. The conversation between Isaac and Tracy is lovely, touching, and tragic, even when it's hopeful. Allen's acting here shows range and ability that he's rarely given credit for.Manhattan is undoubtedly a masterpiece, but it could also be Woody Allen's masterpiece. It's such a perfect balancing act of tone, theme, and dialogue. It's possible that no film he's made before or since has brought these obsessions into such beautiful cinematic harmony with each other. A funny, scathing, and mature film from one of America's most prolific filmmakers, it's shocking that Allen actually tried to block its release due to being unhappy with it. This makes me wonder if he has a deep-rooted fear of success. In a career that spans more than 40 films, Manhattan can be pegged as one of his greats and one of the greats. Recently released on Blu-Ray, it can now be seen in stunning, HD clarity. The picture is a bit grainy, but the HD adds more texture and brings the most out of the beautiful photography. Being an Allen film, the only special feature is a theatrical trailer, but any lover of cinema will be pleased to see this film in all of its glory.GRADE: A",5,Quite Possibly Allen's Greatest

Although &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; is probably my favorite Woody Allen movies, this is Allen's cinematic masterpiece.  Words can't describe how beautiful the lights of Manhattan look as they sparkle through the trees in Central Park.  But the acting shines as well.  Diane Keaton is both hilarious and sad as a neurotic woman who is so full of herself and yet so unlucky in love; Woody Allen plays a divorced, neurotic man (shocker. . .); and while Mariel Hemingway isn't terrible, the tone of her voice and her manner did grate on my nerves a little. . .but that didn't ruin the movie at all.  She is the voice of reason not only to Issac (Allen's character) but for the entire film.It's a true testament to the genius of Allen that his movies, which usually end so sad, can still fill you with hope.

155186,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0792846109,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[37, 44]","When Woody Allen won the Oscar (in abstentia) for writing and directing &quot;Annie Hall,&quot; which also won the Oscar for Best Picture, it was assumed the stand-up comic turned auteur had reached the pinnacle of his career.  Then Allen proceeded to go out and make an even better film with his next effort, &quot;Manhattan.&quot;  Filmed in glorious black &amp; white (and widescreen) by the great cinematographer Gordon Willis, the opening sequence combining indelible images of New York City with Gershwin's &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; is a paean to city Allen loves and the most rhapsodical sequence in any of his films.Rather than talking about the plot per se, &quot;Manhattan&quot; is best explained as a convoluted series of wrecked and ruined relationships centering around Allen's character, Isaac Davis.  Isaac is divorced from Jill (Meryl Streep), who is now living with Connie (Karen Ludwig), and planning to write an expose on her marriage.  Isaac is having an affair with 17-year-old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), but then he meets Mary (Diane Keaton), the mistress of his best friend Yale (Michael Murphy), who is married to Emily (Anne Byrne).  Ultimately, however, this is not a film about love, but rather a film about loss, because you just know that forced to make choices, Isaac is going to make the wrong ones.  Tracy and Mary are characters constructed as such polar opposites and it never dawns on Isaac to focus more on what each has than on what they lack.Of course, today this film is obviously open to reinterpretation given Allen's very public personal life and it is now assumed that the Isaac-Tracy relationship was a sign of things to come rather than a dramatic construction.  If you can get away from the film's Freudian implications then you can appreciate Hemingway's Oscar nominated performance, which is not only at the heart of the film but provides its heart as well.  In contrast, Keaton's Mary is rather soulless (the anti-Annie Hall if you will).  When the choice is so clear the fault is clearly not in the women, but rather in the character of Isaac (or lack of character, as the case might be).  The ending is certainly the most bitter sweet of any Allen film to date.Most Romantic Lines (remember, this is a Woody Allen film): (1) &quot;I think people should mate for life, like pigeons or Catholics&quot;; (2) &quot;Yeah! I can tell, a lot. That's, well, a lot is my favorite number&quot;, and, of course, (3) &quot;Why is life worth living? It's a very good question. Um...Well, There are certain things I guess that make it worthwhile. uh...Like what... okay...um...For me, uh... ooh...

155191,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,0792846109,Michael Crane,"[6, 7]","Woody Allen's ""Manhattan"" is truly one of those rare masterpieces where you don't feel like you're watching a movie with actors.  No, it feels like you're watching life and that these actors are the real people they portray.  You forget that this is only a DVD that's playing on your TV, and that's because you get so wrapped up into it all.  The people are real and flawed, and yet we can't help but sympathize for them all.  After it was done, I seriously had to ask myself, ""Was that a movie I just watched, or did that really happen?""  My only regret is that it took me so long to finally see it, but I guess late is better than never--not to mention that I might not have appreciated it like I do now if I had seen it earlier.The movie is not about plot.  It doesn't feel like it's all getting to this fixed ending that it has been leading to since the first minute.  ""Manhattan"" is focused on these complex and usually unsatisfying relationships.  These people think they're happy one minute, but then you can tell that there's something they find not right about it all.  Issac is a 42 year old who's in a relationship with a girl who is 17 going on 18, but she's more in love with him than he is.  His best friend is having an affair with Jill, and being frustrated with the fact that she's into a married man, she starts hanging out with Isaac and the two start to fall for each other--and this ends up complicating things even further.  Let's not forget the fact that Isaac's ex is writing and publishing a very unfavorable book that details some of the dissatisfactions with their relationship.  In the end, everybody just wants to be happy and find that someone that will make them complete, but as ""Manhattan"" tells it like it is, that is rarely ever an easy task.It sounds like there's so much going on in this film, and yet everything unfolds with such ease.  You never feel overwhelmed, just saddened by the fact that the film is very honest.  Again, all of these people are flawed and have issues, but you can also find something redeeming about all of them.  The cinematography is breathtaking giving you beautiful images of Manhattan, and having it all shot in black & white enhances the movie even more.  I really admire how there are a lot of times where there are scenes that go on without a lot of edits, which brings you into the moment and makes you feel like this is all happening.I know that this review is not doing the movie justice, but it's really hard to sum up the experience in a few paragraphs.  The best advice I can give you is to see it.  Even if you end up not liking it, see it at least once so you can at least say that you have seen it.  The movie is a complete gem when it comes to the writing and the cinematography.  I'm glad that I decided to give this wonderful movie a chance, and it is something I could watch again and again.  ""Manhattan"" is a film that I will never forget, and the very last line is something that will stay with me for days. -Michael Crane",5,"""I thought I took it rather well under the circumstances.

155193,A27PSZX2SE0B51,0792846109,Mike Stone,"[3, 3]","I'm working my way through Woody Allen's oeuvre chronologically.  'Manhattan', to me, was the first time he managed to make an adult comedy that lived up to its artistic pretensions.  It is art on a visual, sonic, aesthetic, and emotional level.  All this, and terribly funny too.I'm not one to fetishize movies that are black and white, and letterboxed.  But this transfer utilizes all those qualities perfectly.  The scene where Woody and Diane dance in his department to the tune of &quot;Embraceable You&quot; (that's the song, if memory serves), is -- cinematographically speaking -- beautifully shot.  It manages to be a very poetically composed image.My favourite sequence is when Isaac and Mary take shelter from the rain inside the planetarium.  It's a very self-conscious moment (i.e., romance under the stars, only the stars are fake, so can the romance be real?) that fits nicely into the midpoint of the film.  Also, it allows Isaac to (later) deliver my favourite line of the movie: &quot;I wanted to throw you down on the lunar surface and commit interstellar perversions.&quot;  What a great Woody line!  If you're under the impression that 'Manhattan' is a &quot;serious&quot; movie, don't worry.  The Woody wit flies fast and furious.  Listen to Isaac's response to Mary's declaration that a child raised by two mothers has a good chance at turning into a healthy result:  &quot;It's my experience that most people don't survive one mother.&quot;  Or his rejoinder to a woman who's doctor told her she had the &quot;wrong kind of orgasm&quot;: &quot;Even my worst one was right on the money.&quot;  The writing is solid, and sometime brilliant.The Isaac and Tracy relationship -- never mind the fact that it's prescient to Woody's own life -- says a lot about the central themes of the film.  I mean, Isaac knows that he's created a problem for himself, one that takes his mind off the impossible 'real' problems that he must deal with (e.g., his current financial crisis).  I found Tracy to be an unbelievable character, a little too mature to be believed (almost prodigious in this regard).  And furthermore, whereas all the men in the film were gaga over her &quot;pretty face&quot;, she seemed kind of plain too me.  In fact, none of the women in the movie were very attractive; they all came off kind of cold and distant.  A touch too analytical about their relationships and sexuality.  I suppose that's part of the point, though.A &quot;film&quot; strives towards an artistic message, combining poetry with humanity.  A &quot;movie's&quot; main goal is to entertain, with art as an afterthought.  After seeing 'Manhattan' for a second time, I've come to the conclusion that it's a better &quot;film&quot; than 'Annie Hall', which is a better &quot;movie&quot;.  You go to one for an entirely different purpose than you go to the other for.  When taken for what they are, however, both are as perfect as Woody Allen is going to get.P.S... Unfortunately, Michael O'Donoghue's (Mr. Mike) lengthy role was cut to two or three lines.

155195,A1HCHMYMPO97CL,0792846109,M. J. Dirou,"[2, 2]","Woody Allen said in an Interview once that 'Manhattan', was never the film he intended to write, the end result turning out infact completely different to the intial vision he had, and that he was actually very surprised at the popularity and accolades it earned by audiences and critics alike. Yet this supposedly unintentional fluke, became the definitive 'Woody Allen' film to many, and a modern cinematic masterpiece that paid reverent hommage to Allen's home town of 'New York City'. A city which Allen's main character 'Issac', admits to 'romantacizing out of all proportion'. I admit it was partly Allen's films over the years that led to my fascination and long distance love affair with New York. A melting pot of artists, writers, intellectuals, Jazz, Gershwin, smokey bars and cosy restaurants, quirky bookshops and delis. And of course the highly strung Manhattan neurotic, never without their 'shrink', or analyst. It's all here in this 70's cinema classic. Woody Allen could not have captured the magic and poetry of his beloved city more sublimely; magnificently filmed in black and white 'Panavision', with an exquisite musical score, cinematography, and all round cast ensemble. Most of my favourite of Allen's films are his collaborations with Diane Keaton, they had such a wonderful chemistry.The charm of Allen's films lie largley in his clever, witty, satirical and often sadonic observations of human nature, foibles and weaknesses. The fragility of life and fickleness of relationships. Allen's movies often present like a modern take on Brechtian theatre, with the central character acting partly as narrator, and detatched observer or commentator as well as participant. Pondering lifes deeper questions, puzzlements and moral dilemmas. Presented always with his wry Jewish American, intellectual brand of humour. Manhattan, along with 'Hannah and her Sisters', and 'Crimes and Misdemeanours', in my view probably display this ""wry observation"" the most stylishly and successfully. His films (particularly the earlier ones) are also full of mocking self parody, where by he is really often just playing himself or at the very least aspects of himself. There are some hilarious moments and memorable vintage 'Woody' lines here.""She's 17 and I'm 42.."". Says Issac to his friends about his young girlfriend Tracey (Mariel Hemmingway).""I'm older than her Father... I'm dating a girl where in I can beat up her Father, that phenomenon never occurred before"". And on relationships: "" I'm old fashioned I believe people should mate for life like pigeons.. or Catholics"". But my favourite, in conversation with his ex wife( the divine Meryl Streep)who left him for another woman:""Well you knew my history when you married me""."" Yeah my analyst warned me, but you were so beautiful that I got another analyst"".The characters in Manhattan are very 'New York' yet ones that audiences recognize within themselves and own lives, or society at large. With all their petty adult problems of extra marital affairs, and flitting from one relationship to the next. Perhaps a subconscious distraction to avoid dealing with life's more deeper issues, such as death. A subject never far from Allen's thoughts.Allen and Keaton are great as always but I think Mariel Hemmingway really steals the show here, she's just perfectly gorgeous as Allen (Issac's) young love interest, who despite her youth has a wisdom beyond her years, enabling her to teach him ultimately as much as he's taught her, especially in the beautifully ironic twist at the end.Manhattan really is a timeless visual piece of cinematic art, and most quintessential 'New York' movie. It most definitely would not have  worked as well in colour. As one reviewer eloquently put it, the city itself is as much a star of this movie as the actors, if not more so.Last year I was finally lucky enough to have my dream of visiting New York City become a reality, and I was not disappointed. Every so often as I strolled through Central Park, or Greenwich village, I half expected to catch a glimpse of Woody in the street, hearing Gershwin and Cole Porter tunes as I gazed at the Brooklyn Bridge or the Russian Tea room.

155196,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,0792846109,M. Oleson,"[2, 3]","Following up on his smash ""Annie Hall,"" Woody Allen displays his love for the city of New York in all her black and white glory.  Woody plays Isaac Davis, an unhappy writer for TV sitcoms.  He has a good life with a nice apartment, good friends and is unashamedly dating a 17 year old high school student (Mariel Hemingway).  Finally fed up with the crap he has to write, he quits his job to pursue his quest of writing a novel.  Now financially strapped, he must move and cut back on expenses including money he sends to his parents.  He bemoans the fact that they won't have as good a seat in the synagogue.  That they will be far away from God...away from the action.  Little gems like that are sprinkled throughout the film.Isaac realizes that while the sex with Tracy (Hemingway) is great, their age difference (25 years) will be an on-going problem.  Eventually he dumps her in favor of an opinionated feminist from Philadelphia (a radiant Diane Keaton).  She herself recently ended an affair with Isaac's married best friend (Michael Murphy).  There is a tangential story line involving Isaac's second ex-wife (Meryl Streep).  She divorced Isaac because she finally realized she was a lesbian.  In another scene, Jill (Streep) argues with Isaac that surely he must have known she wasn't straight.  Isaac quips something about his analyst suggested as much, so he changed analysts.Jill is now writing a ""tell all"" book much to Isaac's consternation.  This theme runs throughout the film.  Ultimately as funny as it is, this is a more expansive vision of love, art and relationships.  It could be argued that it is Woody Allen's greatest film.  I would put it a click behind ""Annie Hall.""The Blu ray transfer is beautiful.  In perhaps Allen's most ambitious stylized film, the black and white picture sparkles.  As usual with Allen's films, the soundtrack is displayed in mono, with options of Dolby Surround or the lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0.  Even with that limitation, the Gershwin oriented score sounds magnificient.

155197,A2MTMDC5UOOFU4,0792846109,"Mooseville ""gvan""","[5, 16]","People tend to fall all over themselves praising Woody Allen's Manhattan with all its aesthetic strengths.  Notable is its photography and score and the collective sensory romancing of NYC.  The dialogue crackles and is very funny, which is the least you want and expect from a Woody Allen film.But because of Allen's portrayal of a 42 year-old man having a fling with an emotionally vulnerable high school girl (are there any other kind?), played by Mariel Hemingway, I found the creepy-factor undermining my total appreciation of this film.  Especially when Allen is dialoguing with her and delivering witty asides about his sexual prowess and being ""lucky if the police don't bust in"".  I understand that this is sophisticated comedy and not one about some guy wiping donut grease on his t-shirt as he's engaged in statutory rape.  But the line that separates one against the other is pretty tenuous.  Once again, the cult of celebrity trumps our willingness to critique this dark streak for what it is, usually for fear of appearing conventional  --not the healthiest thing, especially for a film that has been heralded as among the best offerings of American cinema.Having said that, I do agree that this is a very skillfully made film.  I cannot totally dislike any movie which contains an alleged TV show slyly entitled: ""Human Beings, Wow!"".  I just wish that it wasn't so much of an inverted pyramid in its construction, with skin-deep beauty and a horror operating within; I wish that I could actually follow the central character without wanting to throw up.",3,"Good, but in an inverted way",1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,1569,"['People', 'tend', 'fall', 'praising', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Manhattan', 'aesthetic', 'strengths', 'Notable', 'photography', 'score', 'collective', 'sensory', 'romancing', 'NYC', 'dialogue', 'crackles', 'very', 'funny', 'least', 'want', 'expect', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film.But', 'Allen', 'portrayal', '42', 'year-old', 'man', 'having', 'fling', 'emotionally', 'vulnerable', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'are', 'there', 'other', 'kind', 'played', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'found', 'creepy-factor', 'undermining', 'total', 'appreciation', 'film', 'Especially', 'when', 'Allen', 'dialoguing', 'delivering', 'witty', 'asides', 'sexual', 'prowess', 'being', 'lucky', 'police', 'do', ""n't"", 'bust', 'understand', 'sophisticated', 'comedy', 'not', 'one', 'guy', 'wiping', 'donut', 'grease', 't-shirt', 'engaged', 'statutory', 'rape', 'line', 'one', 'other', 'pretty', 'tenuous', 'Once', 'again', 'cult', 'celebrity', 'willingness', 'critique', 'dark', 'streak', 'what', 'usually', 'fear', 'appearing', 'conventional', 'not', 'healthiest', 'thing', 'especially', 'film', 'been', 'heralded', 'best', 'offerings', 'American', 'cinema.Having', 'said', 'do', 'agree', 'very', 'skillfully', 'made', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'totally', 'dislike', 'movie', 'alleged', 'TV', 'show', 'entitled', 'Human', 'Beings', 'Wow', 'just', 'wish', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'inverted', 'pyramid', 'construction', 'skin-deep', 'beauty', 'horror', 'operating', 'wish', 'could', 'actually', 'follow', 'central', 'character', 'wanting', 'throw', 'up']",N/A

The good news is its better than Annie Hall.Allen (Isaac) plays his usual neurotic New Yorker.  He is a writer for a television show.Mariel Hemingway (Tracy) is his much younger girlfriend.  She is tired of young boys.Meryl Streep (Jill), before she was MERYL STREEP, is his lesbian ex-wife.Michael Murphy (Yale) is his best friend who is having an affair.Diane Keaton (Mary) is the woman Yale is having an affair with.Eventually, Mary dumps Yale and turns to Isaac.  They wind up having an affair, so Isaac breaks up with Tracy.  Of course, Yale and Mary wind up together again and Isaac is alone.This is an oversimplified synopsis.  But if you have seen any of Allen's films during this time, you will figure the rest.The screenplay by Allen and Marshall Brickman is their best.  Additionally, Allen chose to use the music of George Gershwin for the underscore.  Allen felt that Gershwin's music personified the spirit of NYC and he uses it well in the film.Allen cinematographer Gordon Willis felt that using Panavision (16:9 aspect ratio) would best frame the city.  He also wanted to give the film of the 30's, so it is filmed in Black & White.  Both were perfect choices.If you are an Allen fan or just a mild admirer, you will love this film.DVD EXTRAS: None.",5,Woody's Best,1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,1390,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'Manhattan', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'bad', 'news', 'same', 'ground', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'good', 'news', 'better', 'Annie', 'Hall.Allen', 'Isaac', 'usual', 'neurotic', 'New', 'Yorker', 'writer', 'television', 'show.Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'Tracy', 'much', 'younger', 'girlfriend', 'tired', 'young', 'boys.Meryl', 'Streep', 'Jill', 'was', 'MERYL', 'STREEP', 'lesbian', 'ex-wife.Michael', 'Murphy', 'Yale', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'having', 'affair.Diane', 'Keaton', 'Mary', 'woman', 'Yale', 'having', 'affair', 'with.Eventually', 'Mary', 'Yale', 'Isaac', 'wind', 'up', 'having', 'affair', 'so', 'Isaac', 'up', 'Tracy', 'course', 'Yale', 'Mary', 'wind', 'up', 'together', 'again', 'Isaac', 'alone.This', 'oversimplified', 'synopsis', 'have', 'seen', 'Allen', 'films', 'time', 'will', 'figure', 'rest.The', 'screenplay', 'Allen', 'Marshall', 'Brickman', 'best', 'Additionally', 'Allen', 'chose', 'use', 'music', 'George', 'Gershwin', 'underscore', 'Allen', 'felt', 'Gershwin', 'music', 'personified', 'spirit', 'NYC', 'well', 'film.Allen', 'cinematographer', 'Gordon', 'Willis', 'felt', 'using', 'Panavision', '16:9', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'would', 'best', 'frame', 'city', 'also', 'wanted', 'give', 'film', '30', 'filmed', 'Black', 'White', 'were', 'perfect', 'choices.If', 'are', 'Allen', 'fan', 'just', 'mild', 'admirer', 'will', 'love', 'film.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'None']",N/A

This is a movie rich in textures, thanks to Gordon Willis's lush  black-and-white cinematography and Woody Allen's fine script, which casts a  somewhat forgiving eye on its tangled web of relationships. Ultimately, and  as only Woody can, the film's bittersweet ending, while not upbeat, manages  to be uplifting. Memorable performances from Allen, Mariel Hemingway (her  finest performance--bar none), Dianne Keaton, and Michael Murphy. Meryl  Streep makes her film debut in a small part.

Which actually means it's good because there's real talent there.Other things are at work, however.  First of all, we have the opening line about New York, the city that ""exists in black and white and pulses to the sounds of Gershwin music.""  It's a really good image, but I think, unfortunately, that the black and white photography was a bit poor.  Also, I, uh... don't really like Gershwin music.  It's just kind of loud and obnoxious to me.  Which fits New York, but not the nice imagery.This movie is apparently about ""the fall of human values"" or something to that effect.  Can't say I got too much of that out of it, except that the relationships that pull together at the end are definitely more surprising than you'd think.  We expect a different outcome, we're given a different one.This film is also interesting because it features Allen's character dating a high schooler.  I'm not quite clear on the Allen timeline and where he is with his whole crazy relationships thing, so I don't know if this was made before or after he got together with his adopted daughter, but either way it's an interesting thing to put into a film considering the character.Allen also has the ability to make me burst out in laughter despite myself, even during times when I'm not sure I find it funny.All in all it has some good technique and is definitely enjoyable to Allen fans.

From Woody Allen's opening voiceover descriptions of the title city to the farewell shots of the cityscape, it's clear that this isn't just a story about people living within Manhattan, but about the city itself. Gordon Willis' sumptuous photography makes you believe again in why black & white can be so beautiful to look at. Viewing the picture in any other way just would not do. The whole milieu is accented appropriately by George Gershwin's gorgeous musical scores.OK, on to the story...Examining the love-hate personalities of Manhattan, Woody's main character weaves through a tapestry of usual Allen themes: love, sex, existentialism, philosophy, life, art, etc. The central focus is the relationship between middle-aged Woody and a 17-year old (played sweetly & earnestly by Mariel Hemingway), which is handled honestly & delicately in Woody's hands. The dialogues between the two are absolutely charming. Michael Murphy plays Woody's pal, a guy dabbling in extramarital affairs. But midway, Woody--in a story twist only he can do--finds himself inexplicably drawn into an affair with a woman (Diane Keaton, abandoning the comic flakiness, for once) whom he initially finds repulsive. We even see Meryl Streep at the beginning of her film career in a smaller role as Woody's ex-wife, now involved in a same-sex relationship.As with ""Annie Hall"", ""Manhattan"" is peppered with cameos from familiar faces.Watching ""Manhattan"" might make you sigh, wondering why more films aren't created in black & white.",5,Woody's ode to the city he loves,1321142400,"11 13, 2011",2011,1615,"['breakthrough', '1977', 'Annie', 'Hall', '1979', 'Manhattan', 'seemed', 'be', 'logical', 'follow-up', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'opening', 'voiceover', 'descriptions', 'title', 'city', 'farewell', 'shots', 'cityscape', 'clear', ""n't"", 'just', 'story', 'people', 'living', 'Manhattan', 'city', 'Gordon', 'Willis', 'sumptuous', 'photography', 'believe', 'again', 'why', 'black', 'white', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'beautiful', 'look', 'Viewing', 'picture', 'other', 'way', 'just', 'would', 'not', 'do', 'whole', 'milieu', 'accented', 'appropriately', 'George', 'Gershwin', 'gorgeous', 'musical', 'scores.OK', 'story', 'Examining', 'love-hate', 'personalities', 'Manhattan', 'Woody', 'main', 'character', 'weaves', 'tapestry', 'usual', 'Allen', 'themes', 'love', 'sex', 'existentialism', 'philosophy', 'life', 'art', 'etc', 'central', 'focus', 'relationship', 'middle-aged', 'Woody', '17-year', 'old', 'played', 'sweetly', 'earnestly', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'handled', 'honestly', 'delicately', 'Woody', 'hands', 'dialogues', 'two', 'are', 'absolutely', 'charming', 'Michael', 'Murphy', 'Woody', 'pal', 'guy', 'dabbling', 'extramarital', 'affairs', 'midway', 'Woody', 'story', 'twist', 'only', 'can', 'do', 'finds', 'inexplicably', 'drawn', 'affair', 'woman', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'abandoning', 'comic', 'flakiness', 'once', 'whom', 'initially', 'repulsive', 'even', 'see', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'beginning', 'film', 'career', 'smaller', 'role', 'Woody', 'ex-wife', 'now', 'involved', 'same-sex', 'relationship.As', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Manhattan', 'peppered', 'cameos', 'familiar', 'faces.Watching', 'Manhattan', 'might', 'make', 'sigh', 'wondering', 'why', 'more', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'created', 'black', 'white']",N/A

It remains today almost as fresh and marvelous as when I first saw it. Partly the reason for this is the incredibly crisp, beautiful black and white photography, which lends the film a kind of timelessness. The cinematography also is remarkable for being filmed in the widest film ratio (2.35:1), the only time that Woody Allen has used this ratio. He almost always uses 1.85:1. The greatest thing about the photography and the wider ratio is that Allen is able to use it to show effectively the enormous love he has for his home city. In no movie has Manhattan been portrayed so beautifully or exhilaratingly.MANHATTAN was one of two transition films for Woody Allen. Along with ANNIE HALL and INTERIORS, he made the move from purely comic director to a more serious filmmaker. Although my own bias is in favor of the earlier, funnier Allen, I do dearly love both ANNIE HALL and MANHATTAN. In these two films he struck a perfect balance between laughs and seriousness. Too many of his later efforts lean too heavily in the serious direction.The cast, like most Woody Allen films, is absolutely first rate. Ever since ANNIE HALL, Allen has had a genius for having actors and actresses in some of their earliest roles before going on later to become well known or even better known. This film was Meryl Streep's second major film appearance (after DEER HUNTER the previous year) and it was the first major role for Mariel Hemingway, who was just transcendently beautiful in this film. Diane Keaton, of course, had appeared in several of Woody Allen's films when they were romantically involved, but thankfully this didn't keep them from working together on additional films.As a one-time would-be Kierkegaard scholar, I have always been keenly attuned to film or any other cultural references to him, and I would be remiss if I didn't point out that this film contains a brief discussion of his thought much to my delight, and much better one than the rather bizarre quotation from Kierkegaard in Chinese in WAYNE'S WORLD.The use of Gershwin is just exquisite.

Filmed in glorious black and white by Gordon WIllis, this is a robust, indelible piece of art work.

155228,AJ9W09EUQPAKE,0792846109,Sirin,"[5, 5]","Manhattan is the quintessential Woody Allen movie. Annie Hall is funnier, but Manhattan is surely the one Allen movie which captures so beautifully the great auteur's concerns: the love/hate relationship with New York, the frustrations and phoniness of urban intellectualism, the all knowingness of modern city types who cannot enjoy pleasure since they are too world wise, the appeal of the innocent beautiful face, roiling and fizzing jazz music, the egotism and narcissism of men and women in contemporary society (this movie was from the 70s, but these themes are well made for Western urban social scenes today).Manhattan is a movie for modern romance - where passions are washed over as soon as they are arrived at by the next wave of introspection; impulsive decision making; a new face at dinner, or the theatre. Isaac (Allen) is a classic protagonist for Woody Allen's movies - a sexually impulsive man with a razor sharp wit and a sarcastic, nihilistic answer to everything, an egoist who wants to do the right thing but is drowning in a sea of his neurosis. Allen's characters are like the filmic, comic incarnations of the great characters of of masterful novelist Saul Bellow - big hearted people awash in the modern condition, with their minds always on the big picture, the universal scape: hence the famous scene where Isaac meets Mary in the planetarium - the stars look down on their mortal, transient concerns (echoes of the final chapter of the Bellow novel 'The Dean's December'); then again in the school when Isaac confronts his friend Max for taking back Mary, the mistress he had let go - Isaac stands by a skeleton saying 'one day we'll be like this, I hope that when I thin out I'll be looked well on'. (This scene also contains the memorable Allen line - 'you think you're God' - 'well I have to model myself on someone'.)What is life for? Manhattan poses this question beautifully. Some sort of answer occurs as Isaac makes a list towards the end of the movie whilst lying, psychoanalytical style, on the couch: Groucho Marx, the second movement of the Jupiter Symphony, Louis Armstrong's recording of 'Potato Blues', Swedish movies, L'Education Sentimentale by Flaubert, Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando, Cezanne's apples, the crab at Sun Wo's (now no longer in existence). A valid Allen list, but slightly disengenuous - for Woody Allen, cultural epiphanies are a diversion. His real life purpose, which he has executed brilliantly over the years, is to fulfil that great mantra of Charlie Chaplin: life may be a tragedy in close up, but in the long shot it's a comedy.",5,Rhapsody in Grey,1182556800,"06 23, 2007",2007,2596,"['Manhattan', 'quintessential', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'funnier', 'Manhattan', 'surely', 'one', 'Allen', 'movie', 'so', 'beautifully', 'great', 'auteur', 'concerns', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'New', 'York', 'frustrations', 'phoniness', 'urban', 'intellectualism', 'knowingness', 'modern', 'city', 'types', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'enjoy', 'pleasure', 'are', 'too', 'world', 'wise', 'appeal', 'innocent', 'beautiful', 'face', 'roiling', 'fizzing', 'jazz', 'music', 'egotism', 'narcissism', 'men', 'women', 'contemporary', 'society', 'movie', 'was', '70s', 'themes', 'are', 'well', 'made', 'Western', 'urban', 'social', 'scenes', 'today', '.Manhattan', 'movie', 'modern', 'romance', 'where', 'passions', 'are', 'washed', 'as', 'soon', 'are', 'arrived', 'next', 'wave', 'introspection', 'impulsive', 'decision', 'making', 'new', 'face', 'dinner', 'theatre', 'Isaac', 'Allen', 'classic', 'protagonist', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'sexually', 'impulsive', 'man', 'razor', 'sharp', 'wit', 'sarcastic', 'nihilistic', 'answer', 'everything', 'egoist', 'who', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'drowning', 'sea', 'neurosis', 'Allen', 'characters', 'are', 'filmic', 'comic', 'incarnations', 'great', 'characters', 'masterful', 'novelist', 'Saul', 'Bellow', 'big', 'hearted', 'people', 'awash', 'modern', 'condition', 'minds', 'always', 'big', 'picture', 'universal', 'scape', 'hence', 'famous', 'scene', 'where', 'Isaac', 'Mary', 'planetarium', 'stars', 'look', 'down', 'mortal', 'transient', 'concerns', 'echoes', 'final', 'chapter', 'Bellow', 'novel', 'Dean', 'December', 'then', 'again', 'school', 'when', 'Isaac', 'friend', 'Max', 'taking', 'back', 'Mary', 'mistress', 'had', 'let', 'go', 'Isaac', 'skeleton', 'saying', ""'one"", 'day', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hope', 'when', 'thin', 'out', ""'ll"", 'be', 'looked', 'well', 'scene', 'also', 'memorable', 'Allen', 'line', 'think', ""'re"", 'God', ""'well"", 'have', 'model', 'someone', 'What', 'life', 'Manhattan', 'question', 'beautifully', 'sort', 'answer', 'occurs', 'Isaac', 'list', 'end', 'movie', 'whilst', 'lying', 'psychoanalytical', 'style', 'couch', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'second', 'movement', 'Jupiter', 'Symphony', 'Louis', 'Armstrong', 'recording', ""'Potato"", 'Blues', 'Swedish', 'movies', ""L'Education"", 'Sentimentale', 'Flaubert', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Cezanne', 'apples', 'crab', 'Sun', 'Wo', 'now', 'no', 'longer', 'existence', 'valid', 'Allen', 'list', 'slightly', 'disengenuous', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'cultural', 'epiphanies', 'are', 'diversion', 'real', 'life', 'purpose', 'executed', 'brilliantly', 'years', 'fulfil', 'great', 'mantra', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'tragedy', 'close', 'long', 'shot', 'comedy']",N/A

The excellent two part documentary by PBS, which aired in November, compelled me to watch this great film once again. I must say that, over time, Manhattan has aged quite well. The cinematography remains excellent and perhaps is the best of any Woody Allen film. Radiating in gourgeous black and white, and enhanced by the great use of George Gershwin's music, the film remains a true feast for the eyes. So much so that during the Academy Awards for films of 1979, the master cinematographer Haskell Wexler raged to the Academy that one of the best names in his field, Gordan Willis, had been left off the ballot. Of course, prior to films made up to 1967, Oscar separated between black-and-and white and color films, as well as in Art Direction and Costume Design. Beginning in 1967, films made in color as well as in black-and -white were distilled into one category. Woody re-visits his themes of troubled relationships, cerebral friends, and comedy. Mariel Hemingway did receive a Best Supporting Nomination and Woody did receive another screenwriting nomination, but neither won an Oscar.

Unfortunately, the accompanying story does not measure up to the breathtaking visuals on display.Isaac Davis (Allen) is dating 17-year-old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) but finds his eye wandering toward Mary Wilkie (Diane Keaton), the mistress of his friend Yale (Michael Murphy).  Isaac has his share of misery in his life as his television writing job is unfulfilling and his ex-wife Jill (Meryl Streep) is writing a book that will not portray him in a dignified light.  Thinking that change will do him good, Isaac leaves his job, breaks up with Tracy, and courts Mary.  Harsh reality then sets in as he realizes his decisions have not worked out for the best.The performances in ""Manhattan"" are very good as one would come to expect from a Woody Allen film.  However, the story this time around has a more distant feel to it compared to his previous works.  As a result, one never develops enough of an interest in the characters and their respective plights.  Of special note though is the performance turned in by Hemingway who brings a haunting innocence to her teenaged character.  Yet, in the end, it is the cinematography of ""Manhattan"" that will linger in your mind upon its completion.

He wrote, directed, and acted in this film which pays homage to Gershwin's brilliant score featured in the film. The Gershwin music is timeless and classic as ever in this film. Woody Allen's genius is his ability to know where, when, and how to use the music to enhance the experience. The film was shot in black and white in widescreen cinematography with his cast of first rate actors like Meryl Streep (played his lesbian ex-wife Jill); Mariel Hemingway (played his teenage girlfriend); and his girlfriend at the time, Diane Keaton, as Mary, his love interest.The film is about Isaac trying to recover from a nasty divorce as his ex-wife writes a book about their marriage. Meryl Streep is perfect as the cold, distant, lesbian ex-wife. The film is about Isaac's pursuit of happiness in finding love. Amid his sea of neurosis, Isaac is very much Woody Allen or vice versa. The film is shot entirely on location in Manhattan, his beloved island and city. It's a fine film and expected from Woody Allen. It's Gershwin's score which is the star in my opinion. The score highlights the film and the city.Anyway, I think this DVD could have showed bonus materials such as as the making of Manhattan; a biography of Woody Allen and the Gershwins as well and other cast members. While I enjoyed the film, it's typical Woody Allen at best. It's still interesting to see the intellectual, cerebral minority of society who worship literature and aren't different from the rest of society. The characters here are real but they still have primitive needs and desires like the rest of us to be fulfilled. I think that's Woody Allen's problem.

155237,A1FA0GBB3S1MWU,0792846109,Timothy R Whitelaw,"[0, 0]","Woody Allen may never have reached a greater height of personnal achievement than in Manhattan, a rhapsodic urban poem of human relationships in tangles,  of love, friendship and betrayal - Allen's world has never found a more beautiful or eloquent expression.  More literary in structure and design than Allen's earler efforts (the script was knocked in to shape by Allen's co-writer Marshall Brickman), yet less derivative,  the picture is funny without being trivial and serious without being portentous.  Allen's decision to shoot in black-and-white removes the picture several levels from reality, and New York becomes a beautiful but de-humanised backdrop against which the human relationships are played out.  Allen plays Issac, a 42 year old author with two ex-wifes and a seventeen year old girl-friend, Stacy,whom he is considering dropping in favour of his best friend Yale's neurotic, intellectual mistress ( played by Dianne Keaton).  Althogh Allen's characters gravitate towards moral and ethical certainties they can't bring themselves to commit to them fully. It is the admission of of such ambiguity in human relationships and his exploration of them that has always elevated Allen above the level of a humorist - in his own words the picture is about &quot;trying to lead an ethical life in a city  de-humanised by drugs, violence and fast-food.&quot; And there is genuine tragedy here in Allen's moral tug-of-war over the legitmacy of his relationship with the seventeen-old Stacy (played with heart-breaking sweetness and honesty by a young Mariel Hemingway), whether or not he should also be in love in with his best friend's mistress and indeed in the relationships of all the characters who struggle earnestly to find a connection that is emotional, physical and intellectual.  There is humour to, but always at the service of insight rather than at its expense.  Sumptuously shot in a down-at-heel 1970s New York, Allen's thoughtful framing immortalises much of the imagery - the picture's most famous image of the figures of Allen and Keaton looking out over the East river under the oppressive shadow of a collosal bridge is at once both romantic yet isolated and cool.

155242,A2KU5PG32H7QBN,0792846109,"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic""","[2, 4]","There's a scene in this film where Woody Allen is lying on his couch, lethargic and immensely depressed. He's talking into a tape recorder, and he says something along the lines of, &quot;I'm thinking about writing a short story about people in Manhattan who are constantly creating these real, unnecessary, neurotic problems for themselves, because it keeps them from dealing with more unsolvable, terrifying problems about the universe.&quot; What an interesting issue he's preparing to approach in his latest work of art. And purposefully (for obvious reasons), that quote sums up the entire film.Manhattan surrounds the lives of Isaac (Woody Allen), his ex-wife Jill (Meryl Streep), his best friend Yale (Michael Murphy), his seventeen-year-old girlfriend Tracy (the Oscar-nominated Marial Hemmingway), Yale's wife (Anne Byrne Hoffman), and, of course, Yale's mistress Mary (the wonderful Diane Keaton). One day, Isaac and Tracy are on a date and they come across Yale spending the day with Mary. And that's what starts it all. At first Isaac despises Mary's overbearing, free personality. But eventually he runs into her again and he gives her a chance, walking home with her after a gala. And the two become great friends, leading to something more, causing an entire love triangle to form, affecting every character in the film in different ways. But of course, that's not all there is to it.The love triangle between Mary, Isaac and Yale is a vehicle for studying the behavioral habits of Isaac, the film's main focus. He is an intensely neurotic man who, like he says at one point in the film, fixates on smaller problems in order to rid his mind of the larger ones he is afraid to face. But as the love triangle progresses, falls apart, nearly comes back together, then falls apart again, he transforms into another man at the end. And the way Woody Allen carefully (and in a very clever way) tells the tale and explains the change is so utterly original and touching that it will leave you breathless.That is, of course, the high point of the film: its screenplay. There are so many brilliantly subtle jokes and so many of Isaac's mannerisms made fun of and focuses upon that the smile will never leave your face. It is also full of artistic maturity and integrity which Allen, in his early days (apparently), never ceased to express. Not once does he stray from the purpose of the film. Nor does he create unnecessary or cliche plot points or become dishonest in any way. He remains true to himself and the the world. And what strengthens the writing are the wonderful performances from every person in the cast.Of course, Marial Hemmingway was nominated for the Oscar. And although she was great, the truly wonderful performance in this film was Diane Keaton's as the confused, newly-divorced Mary. She is so precise with her emotions, but reveals so many shades and builds upon the already realistic depth of Allen's screenplay. She should have been nominated for the Oscar. Also noticeably great was, of course, Woody Allen himself, who is always wonderful. Another character clearly and beautifully conveyed in the film is the city of New York.The widescreen, black-and-white cinematography by Gordon Willis is stunning, and matches the overall tone of the film perfectly. Also complementing the photography and personality of the film is the music scattered throughout, all written by George Gershwin (the film even opens up with the commanding sound of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;).So as you turn off your television and relax after having finished Manhattan, you are sure to be filled with amazement at how honest, witty and glorious the film is, with the clear knowledge that Woody Allen is a pure genius.",5,A brilliant character study!,1081555200,"04 10, 2004",2004,3726,"['scene', 'film', 'where', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'lying', 'couch', 'lethargic', 'immensely', 'depressed', 'talking', 'tape', 'recorder', 'something', 'lines', 'quot', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'writing', 'short', 'story', 'people', 'Manhattan', 'who', 'are', 'constantly', 'creating', 'real', 'unnecessary', 'neurotic', 'problems', 'dealing', 'more', 'unsolvable', 'terrifying', 'problems', 'universe.', 'quot', 'What', 'interesting', 'issue', 'preparing', 'approach', 'latest', 'work', 'art', 'purposefully', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'quote', 'sums', 'up', 'entire', 'film.Manhattan', 'lives', 'Isaac', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'ex-wife', 'Jill', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'best', 'friend', 'Yale', 'Michael', 'Murphy', 'seventeen-year-old', 'girlfriend', 'Tracy', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Marial', 'Hemmingway', 'Yale', 'wife', 'Anne', 'Byrne', 'Hoffman', 'course', 'Yale', 'mistress', 'Mary', 'wonderful', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'One', 'day', 'Isaac', 'Tracy', 'are', 'date', 'come', 'Yale', 'spending', 'day', 'Mary', 'what', 'first', 'Isaac', 'Mary', 'overbearing', 'free', 'personality', 'eventually', 'again', 'chance', 'walking', 'home', 'gala', 'two', 'become', 'great', 'friends', 'leading', 'something', 'more', 'causing', 'entire', 'love', 'triangle', 'form', 'affecting', 'character', 'film', 'different', 'ways', 'course', 'not', 'it.The', 'love', 'triangle', 'Mary', 'Isaac', 'Yale', 'vehicle', 'studying', 'behavioral', 'habits', 'Isaac', 'film', 'main', 'focus', 'intensely', 'neurotic', 'man', 'who', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'smaller', 'problems', 'order', 'rid', 'mind', 'larger', 'ones', 'afraid', 'face', 'love', 'triangle', 'apart', 'nearly', 'back', 'together', 'then', 'apart', 'again', 'man', 'end', 'way', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'carefully', 'very', 'clever', 'way', 'tale', 'change', 'so', 'utterly', 'original', 'touching', 'will', 'leave', 'course', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'screenplay', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'brilliantly', 'subtle', 'jokes', 'so', 'many', 'Isaac', 'mannerisms', 'made', 'fun', 'smile', 'will', 'never', 'leave', 'face', 'also', 'full', 'artistic', 'maturity', 'integrity', 'Allen', 'early', 'days', 'apparently', 'never', 'ceased', 'express', 'Not', 'once', 'stray', 'purpose', 'film', 'create', 'unnecessary', 'cliche', 'plot', 'points', 'become', 'dishonest', 'way', 'true', 'world', 'what', 'writing', 'are', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'person', 'cast.Of', 'course', 'Marial', 'Hemmingway', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'was', 'great', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'film', 'was', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'confused', 'newly-divorced', 'Mary', 'so', 'precise', 'emotions', 'reveals', 'so', 'many', 'shades', 'builds', 'already', 'realistic', 'depth', 'Allen', 'screenplay', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Also', 'noticeably', 'great', 'was', 'course', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'who', 'always', 'wonderful', 'character', 'clearly', 'beautifully', 'conveyed', 'film', 'city', 'New', 'York.The', 'widescreen', 'black-and-white', 'cinematography', 'Gordon', 'Willis', 'stunning', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'perfectly', 'Also', 'complementing', 'photography', 'personality', 'film', 'music', 'scattered', 'written', 'George', 'Gershwin', 'film', 'even', 'up', 'commanding', 'sound', 'quot', 'Rhapsody', 'Blue', 'quot', '.So', 'turn', 'off', 'television', 'relax', 'having', 'finished', 'Manhattan', 'are', 'sure', 'be', 'filled', 'amazement', 'how', 'honest', 'witty', 'glorious', 'film', 'clear', 'knowledge', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'pure', 'genius']",N/A

New York City is affectionately lensed in black-and-white, and brought to life with a score featuring music by George Gershwin. There are several inspired moments: A twilight scene filmed under the Brooklyn Bridge; a conversation between Allen and Keaton in silhouette against a background of stars and planets at the Natural History Museum in Central Park, a scene which beautifully encapsulates the irony at the centre of Woody's persona.At the same time, however, I cannot escape the feeling that our experience of the characters in Manhattan is, for the most part, a cerebral one. We do not care for Isaac the way we cared for, say, Alvy in Annie Hall. Stunning, intelligent, undoubtedly the work of a very accomplished filmmaker, but the film lacks the heart of some of his other work.
