Yes, I did sweat and felt good afterwards, but  I like TaeBo II: Get Ripped Advanced Workout better, it was filmed in a less desired studio but I felt like it was more genuine, people were working harder and it felt less choreograph. It also made me work harder and there were less interruptions.  I felt that with this DVD that there were too many breaks and it did not feel advanced.

After not exercising for several months, I have jumped back into my Tae Bo workouts. When I saw that Tae Bo Advanced was being released, I eagerly pre-ordered it.The new workout uses the same old set and participants from the most recent Tae Bo releases. This an advanced workout, so there is no stretching as you jumps into the workout at a faster pace than normal. Most of the typical moves are here, with the addition to a few new ones, some change ups and new combos.I started to sweat about ten-minutes into the workout and was soaked from head to toe by the end.Is it as good as the old advanced workouts?All I can say is that it has a different routine than what the others had.Overall, I'm more than satisfied with my purchase.",5,Tae Bo Advanced is Not for Beginners!,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,836,"['Last', 'year', 'got', 'whole', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'thing', 'now', 'own', 'several', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'few', 'VHS', 'not', 'exercising', 'several', 'months', 'have', 'jumped', 'back', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'workouts', 'When', 'saw', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'Advanced', 'was', 'being', 'released', 'eagerly', 'pre-ordered', 'it.The', 'new', 'workout', 'same', 'old', 'set', 'participants', 'most', 'recent', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'advanced', 'workout', 'stretching', 'jumps', 'workout', 'faster', 'pace', 'normal', 'Most', 'typical', 'moves', 'are', 'here', 'addition', 'few', 'new', 'ones', 'change', 'ups', 'new', 'combos.I', 'started', 'sweat', 'ten-minutes', 'workout', 'was', 'soaked', 'head', 'toe', 'end.Is', 'as', 'good', 'old', 'advanced', 'workouts', 'can', 'say', 'different', 'routine', 'what', 'others', 'had.Overall', ""'m"", 'more', 'satisfied', 'purchase']",N/A
1594514,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B009B82FUU,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[0, 0]","Billy Blanks: Tae Bo Advanced DVD is not a reissue of one of the twelve Advanced Live videos that came out when Tae Bo was at its peek of popularity.  Those Tae Bo Veterans expecting this to be the case, prepare to be slightly disappointed.The Advanced Live series featured exhilarating music from actual artists that enhanced Billy's routine.  They were fast-paced and enjoyable.  (Hint: Reissue this series on DVD so that Tae Bo veterans that no longer have VHS players can still experience them.) This newer offering uses tinny computerized background sounds to keep the pace--not memorable.In this 2012 version of Advanced, Billy is featured with a smaller group of participants in a martial arts setting complete with samurai swords and kanji pictogram posters.  Billy forgoes the usual warm-up and gets right into a fairly fast-paced (when compared to other ""Advanced"" Tae Bo routines) set of moves.  He relies on his ""butterfly"" side-to-side move often when he just wants to keep his company moving and he can regroup as to what to do next.  In typical Billy fashion, he does forget to do both sides at times, but as this is a cardio workout, it doesn't matter much.This is a long DVD for those who have been conditioned by other more recent Tae Bo offerings.  Its over an hour while the others have logged in at about 45 minutes--complete with warm-up and cool-down.  There is a cool down on this DVD as well as a motivational message at the end.Some of the moves are awkward and since this is considered 'advanced' most of the slow moves meant to teach the sequence really do not need to be executed.  Anyone who has done Tae Bo before knows what ""In and Out"" is and should be familiar with the various punches and kicks.  The constant tutelage breaks the momentum and becomes extremely frustrating once your heart rate is up.  As with other Tae Bo DVDs, I find that doing your own thing during these moments works just as well--just wish the music was more stimulating. (wondering if there was some licensing problem with the original Live series and Billy had to abandon using actual music by artists.)Billy does throw in some more aggressive moves which, if your body isn't sweating up to this point in the session, it will be after these surprise moves.  These include jumping and throw-downs with push-ups which almost come as a departure from the rest of the exercises.Bottom line?  Tae Bo Advanced is longer than most of the recent Tae Bo Advanced offerings.  It is a Cardio DVD, does not include a warm-up, uses less-than optimal background music, but does give you a fairly good workout.  Jumps and push-ups included.  Usual cool-down and motivational speech.

1594515,AI2C1A86S8X1R,B009B82FUU,Donna Simmons,"[0, 0]","I own many Tae Bo workouts. This one is up there with my favorites. There is some floor work, but it's very short. A few push ups (I HATE push ups) and some knee raises from the floor. I don't care much for those, but I'm sure my body needs it. I am thinking this video was intended to be called &#34;Push It&#34; because it's mentioned a few times throughout. The DVD is an hour in length. The warm up is fast paced. I actually sweated during the warm up. 4 minutes is cool down. In between is fast paced with few breaks. And those few breaks go by extremely fast! There is less talk in this one compared to the others. Some of the moves I don't quite have yet, but today was my first time using it. I figured as long as I'm moving it's all good. The only problem I had were a couple of the girls were a more of a distraction. They were both in black. One did the moves very well but I wish she would have put on a better top. Her saggy boobs distracted me. lol The other girl, I believe, was there to look pretty. Her make up was immaculate, hair was cute, moves were sloppy. If you're new to Tae Bo I don't suggest this one yet. You could be overwhelmed by the moves, lack of explanation of those moves and the duration and intensity. When I have a 'lazy day' I prefer the Get Amped! series.During the workout Billy informs us that their sweat is real, no machines involved to spray 'em down with fake sweat. lol That tickled me :D",5,Their sweat is real,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,1434,"['own', 'many', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'one', 'there', 'favorites', 'floor', 'work', 'very', 'short', 'few', 'push', 'ups', 'HATE', 'push', 'ups', 'knee', 'floor', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', ""'m"", 'sure', 'body', 'am', 'thinking', 'video', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'called', '34', 'Push', '34', 'mentioned', 'few', 'times', 'DVD', 'hour', 'length', 'warm', 'up', 'fast', 'paced', 'actually', 'sweated', 'warm', 'up', '4', 'minutes', 'cool', 'down', 'fast', 'paced', 'few', 'breaks', 'few', 'breaks', 'go', 'extremely', 'fast', 'less', 'talk', 'one', 'compared', 'others', 'moves', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'yet', 'today', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'using', 'figured', 'as', 'long', ""'m"", 'moving', 'good', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'were', 'couple', 'girls', 'were', 'more', 'distraction', 'were', 'black', 'One', 'did', 'moves', 'very', 'well', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'better', 'top', 'saggy', 'boobs', 'distracted', 'lol', 'other', 'girl', 'believe', 'was', 'there', 'look', 'pretty', 'make', 'up', 'was', 'immaculate', 'hair', 'was', 'cute', 'moves', 'were', 'sloppy', ""'re"", 'new', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'do', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'one', 'yet', 'could', 'be', 'overwhelmed', 'moves', 'lack', 'explanation', 'moves', 'duration', 'intensity', 'When', 'have', ""'lazy"", 'day', 'prefer', 'Get', 'Amped', 'series.During', 'workout', 'Billy', 'sweat', 'real', 'machines', 'involved', 'spray', 'down', 'fake', 'sweat', 'tickled', 'D']",N/A

While better than a lot of the various Tae Bo workouts in this area, I don't think they are needed at all.  Most of the people who buys these have done more than a couple of them and hence know how to do the routines.  It does give you a chance to catch your breath if you need it but would prefer to move right from one to another without a break.  Billy of course needs to stop talking so much, but that is a given in any of these workouts, the only motivation it gives me is to turn off the sound.",4,Good workout,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,620,"['only', 'complaint', 'being', 'called', 'advanced', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'have', 'slow', 'motion', 'how', 'do', 'routines', 'better', 'lot', 'various', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'area', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'needed', 'Most', 'people', 'who', 'buys', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'couple', 'hence', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'routines', 'give', 'chance', 'catch', 'breath', 'need', 'would', 'prefer', 'move', 'right', 'one', 'break', 'Billy', 'course', 'needs', 'stop', 'talking', 'so', 'much', 'given', 'workouts', 'only', 'motivation', 'turn', 'off', 'sound']",N/A
