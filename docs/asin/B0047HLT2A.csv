He wanted this movie on all day, even when he was sleeping off and on he wanted it on in the background!  ""Wobbly Wheels & Whistles"" is a DVD with four Thomas & Friends episodes back to back.  Thomas and his friends have to move Jobi wood, cross Shake Shake Bridge, work together, understand priorities, and most important have fun!  The one train tries to be the most useful engine by doing everything he can, but then he doesn't finish and it is poor workmanship, he realizes that he needs to prioritize and say no to jobs he doesn't have time for.  Another episode features an older train afraid of the woods but he doesn't want to ask for help or admit he is scared.  It is a great DVD full of great lessons and perfect for any child!  I love the new CGI animation used because everything is so brightly animated and fun looking!",5,Great lessons to learn!,1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,905,"['son', 'was', 'sick', 'yesterday', 'wanted', 'just', 'lay', 'couch', 'day', 'wanted', 'movie', 'day', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'sleeping', 'off', 'wanted', 'background', 'Wobbly', 'Wheels', 'Whistles', 'DVD', 'four', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'back', 'back', 'Thomas', 'friends', 'have', 'move', 'Jobi', 'wood', 'cross', 'Shake', 'Shake', 'Bridge', 'work', 'together', 'understand', 'priorities', 'most', 'important', 'have', 'fun', 'one', 'train', 'tries', 'be', 'most', 'useful', 'engine', 'doing', 'everything', 'can', 'then', ""n't"", 'finish', 'poor', 'workmanship', 'prioritize', 'say', 'jobs', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'episode', 'older', 'train', 'afraid', 'woods', ""n't"", 'want', 'ask', 'help', 'admit', 'scared', 'great', 'DVD', 'full', 'great', 'lessons', 'perfect', 'child', 'love', 'new', 'CGI', 'animation', 'used', 'everything', 'so', 'brightly', 'animated', 'fun', 'looking']",N/A
