28929,AHCVWPLA1O4X8,0780618831,bixodoido,"[6, 7]","This is another well-made documentary by Ken Burns.  What I love most about his films is that they incorporate beautiful and relevant images and scenery with important quotes, figures, and anecdotes from the event in question.  It would have been a difficult task to produce a four-hour documentary on this expedition--there were no photographs taken, and little physical evidence still exists from the trip.  But the scenery is still there, and Burns makes ample use of it.The best part about this documentary, however, is the characterization--not only of Lewis and Clark, but also of their men.  This film portrays them as a closely-knit family, a band of brothers.  And, most importantly, it shows that they were ALL heroes, down to the last and weakest of the men.  Lewis and Clark are portrayed as the extraordinary individuals and talented leaders that they were, but the ugly side of both men is also apparent.  Lewis and Clark were human, and this is one of the things that makes them such spectacular models of American spirit and courage.  This film helps us to see Lewis and Clark, as well as Thomas Jefferson, as the great heroes they were.Like Burns's documentaries on Mark Twain and the Civil War, this film successfully conveys the emotion, the feeling of the Lewis and Clark expedition.  This is much more than just a rambling of dry historians or a rattling of dates and facts, this is a story.  Most importantly, it is a true story, told in a true manner, one which will give inspiration and courage for many generations to come.",5,A wonderful telling of one of the great American stories,1053388800,"05 20, 2003",2003,1548,"['well-made', 'documentary', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'What', 'love', 'most', 'films', 'incorporate', 'beautiful', 'relevant', 'images', 'scenery', 'important', 'quotes', 'figures', 'event', 'question', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'task', 'produce', 'four-hour', 'documentary', 'expedition', 'were', 'photographs', 'taken', 'little', 'physical', 'evidence', 'still', 'trip', 'scenery', 'still', 'there', 'Burns', 'ample', 'use', 'it.The', 'best', 'part', 'documentary', 'however', 'characterization', 'not', 'only', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'also', 'men', 'film', 'closely-knit', 'family', 'band', 'brothers', 'most', 'importantly', 'were', 'ALL', 'heroes', 'down', 'last', 'weakest', 'men', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'are', 'portrayed', 'extraordinary', 'individuals', 'talented', 'leaders', 'were', 'ugly', 'side', 'men', 'also', 'apparent', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'were', 'human', 'one', 'things', 'such', 'spectacular', 'models', 'American', 'spirit', 'courage', 'film', 'see', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'as', 'well', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'great', 'heroes', 'were.Like', 'Burns', 'documentaries', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'Civil', 'War', 'film', 'successfully', 'emotion', 'feeling', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'expedition', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'rambling', 'dry', 'historians', 'rattling', 'dates', 'facts', 'story', 'Most', 'importantly', 'true', 'story', 'told', 'true', 'manner', 'one', 'will', 'give', 'inspiration', 'courage', 'many', 'generations', 'come']",N/A

The greatest feat of exploration of the past century was the manned landing on the moon. However, it was more a feat of technology than a voyage of discovery. In the nineteenth century, the greatest feat of exploration in North America was the journey of the corps of discovery, where Meriwether Lewis and William Clark led a small expedition up the Missouri river and over land to the Pacific ocean. Sent by President Jefferson shortly after the Louisiana Purchase, their mandate was to map, gather scientific data on the wildlife, search for a Northwest passage to the Pacific and to make contact with the native American inhabitants.  Amazingly, they did all three, being more successful than even the greatest of optimists could have foreseen.Retracing their journey and interspersed with dramatic reenactments, this tape is truly history in action. With no possibility of relief arriving for years, they were required to live on what they could carry as well as what they could find on the land or obtain from the natives. What was most interesting about the tape is the descriptions of their relationships with the various tribes they encountered. Truly, without the active assistance of several tribes, they would have starved to death or have been forced to turn back. In fact, a Shoshone woman named Sacagawea traveled with them for most of the journey, carrying her infant son every step of the way. It is a tribute to Lewis and Clark that they kept such accurate and honest journals. From them, we can learn what happened, and there is no hint of personal embellishment in their writings. In hearing these accounts, you cannot help but wonder if the native tribes understood that their world had changed forever, and of course not for the better.I have traveled most of their route by vehicle, and when you move up the mountains, you cannot help but be impressed by how difficult it was for them to move over them by horseback. Keep in mind that they were also carrying extensive munitions, goods for trade and other miscellaneous necessities. Furthermore, there was only one fatality among the members of the corps, and that was most likely appendicitis, something that no medical person on the planet could have successfully treated.The journey of Lewis & Clark irrevocably changed the social structure of half of what is now the continental United States.

The Core of Discovery expedition was more than a century and a half before my birth and yet, this film made me feel as if I were a member.Like other Ken Burns films, it is long. However, like other Ken Burns films, it encouraged me to take my time. I watched the 4 hours one segment at a time in the evenings with dinner over the course of almost two weeks. And what a viewing!I never knew that the Lewis and Clark expedition was a military expedition. I never knew that Lewis and Clark where military officers and that they took a platoon of soldiers with them. I never knew that they took plant and animal samples, including sending a live ground hog back to Thomas Jefferson.I never knew that the expedition was called the Core of Discovery or that these two incredible military officers took so many soldiers such an incredible distance over the course of years and lost only one, who was lost to a disease that most likely no one could have cured at the time. I never knew that they drew the first map of most of the United States, using only dead reconning and were accurate to withing 40 miles of the actual distance despite their primative instruments and a distance of some 4,000 miles! I never knew these men were so incredible. And, I never knew that Merriweather Lewis was so incredibly depressed that he died, ""I'm sorry to say,"" by suicide.This film is so personal, I felt the tears that the historian on the film displayed when he told of Lewis' death. He died more than a century before my birth and yet, by the time I was finished with the film, I felt pain for his death, anger at York's difficulty gaing his freedom and sadness at the passing of the Shoshone Indian lady guide Sakajeya.Films like this might actually make me like history, a topic I learned to hate in elementary school.

This wonderful program is a great way to become more familiar with this fascinating story and that great band of explorers (including the woman on our Golden Dollar: Sacagawea).  Hal Holbrook is a great narrator and the writing is quite good.  The visuals are even better.  It is stunning to view and brings some real appreciation to what the Corps of Discovery accomplished.  Just taking that boat upstream for so many miles is stunning, let alone all the cataloging they did in the face of a very real struggle for survival.It is also amazing to see how many vistas Burns and crew were able to find in such a seemingly pristine state.  One of the real shocks to me was to understand how nearly deadly the Great Plains were to the Corps because of the lack of wood.  Growing up in Michigan with trees everywhere, we take wood for granted.  On that expedition, its lack was a real hardship.While not as dramatic as war and without and the lack of contemporary illustrations requires a different presentation style than Burns normally provides, this is still a visual feast and good solid food for the brain.

Sanderman,"[14, 14]","When I was growing up in Oregon, the Lewis & Clark Expedition was raised up as one of the most important events in American History and we got to learn about it every year.  Of course, the entire focus of the journey was on reaching the Oregon Country and the winter they spent at Fort Clatsop.  I was always captivated by the journey and loved visiting some of the sites along the trail.When I came across this Ken Burns documentary, I was excited by the prospect of its four hour run time.  I've seen many films about the expedition that try to squeeze the trip into a 45 minute adventure.  And let me tell you: this film delivers.  It lived up to all of my expectations.Given its running time, LEWIS & CLARK: THE JOURNEY OF THE CORPS OF DISCOVERY has time to dwell on the entire journey.  I was amazed by how much I learned about the expedition BEFORE they reached the Columbia (something largely left out of my childhood lectures).  The film, in many parts, is beautifully shot and Burns manages to capture many parts of the country without capturing modern civilization.Of course, I agree with those reviewers who argue that the film does gloss over some of the impact the expedition had on the course of American history.  While the narrators mention the destruction that would befall the Native American tribes and the fact that Lewis & Clark were brining a message of American empire, this documentary could have used a little more historical realism.  But the film wouldn't have been as cheery or sentimental that way.Stephen Ambrose, despite the claims of accuracy that many have touted on this site, gets a little too involved for my tastes. Of course, he is a fabulous storyteller.  He'd be a great grandfather to have around.  But one has to wonder while listening to him exactly where he is embellishing and ""filling in"" the history and how much he is reporting.On the whole, I thoroughly enjoyed LEWIS & CLARK: THE JOURNEY OF THE CORPS OF DISCOVERY.  It is a great historical work and a piece of art as well.  I have watched it twice already and have not been bored.  If you're interested in Lewis & Clark, this is a great way to bring history into the television room.

We didn't even know about the Rocky Mountains, let alone the Cascades.  All we knew, or thought we knew, was the head-waters of the Missouri River would show us the route to the Pacific.Jefferson made the Louisiana Purchase of lands from the Gulf north and west into the unknown, and those lands had to be explored and charted.  An expedition was sent by President Jefferson into these unknown lands as strange to us back then as the moon or Mars is to us, today.  Yet, while the Apollo astronauts had communications with the friendly folks at NASA, this rustic party of explorers were on their own.  Equipped with all the state-of-the-art equipment of the day, there were no camera'd rovers to show them what they faced and only vague stories passed on by trappers and Indians as to what may be found.  But they assembled their team and set out not knowing whether they would survive, some saying their chances were nil and they'd never return.  Yet they succeeded!

The film moves along faithful to the journey, with historians and writers adding drama and color, but what was missing, for me, was more in-depth information.  Perhaps much is lost to history, but I would have liked to have learned so much more:What is a keel boat?  What were the medicinals of the time?  What kinds of rifles did they likely carry?  What were they likely to have worn?  How did they cook?  How would they have survived the winters?  More information on the Native American tribes would have been wonderful. Also, more about the scientific writings and discoveries, the flora, fauna, geology, etc. After all, that was the journey's purpose.  What would Thomas Jefferson have wanted to know?The music was great, the filming well-done and I was relieved there were no re-enactments.  Still the whole thing seemed rather cold and unaffecting.

Now, after viewing the DVD, I have to add one more to the glowing reviews!This DVD chronicles the journey of Meriwether Lewis, William Clark and the &#34;Corps of Discovery&#34;, beginning with the decision by Thomas Jefferson to buy &#34;Louisiana&#34; from France. Jefferson himself chose the man who would lead the expedition - Meriwether Lewis. Lewis, once appointed to command, immediately contacted his friend William Clark, younger brother of George Rogers Clark (a hero of the frontier in the &#34;Old Northwest&#34;), to join him.The video follows the path taken by these explorers in their epic trek to the west and back. The DVD does an excellent job of showing the viewer the types of terrain and the beauty of the west. The cinematography is simply excellent! The production does an excellent job of showing the challenges encountered by the explorers, from the freezing snows of the passes of the Rocky Mountains to the often dangerous Indian tribes. Though the Mandans were friendly, many tribes including the Sioux were hostile and were ever ready to rob or slaughter the explorers.It does a good job of showing the courage and fortitude required by these men who suffered through hunger, snow and cold, threat to life from Indians. Shows the vital part played by the young woman known as Sacagawea and how she was able to obtain assistance from the tribe she had been taken from and made a slave. It turns out that an important chief was her long-separated brother!This is truly an excellent production from a visual standpoint as well as effectively (and enjoyably) telling the story of &#34;Lewis and Clark&#34;. If it has any flaw, it's the usual handwringing over slavery all the while making no moral point of the enslavement among Indians as exemplified by Sacagawea herself.

During the presidency of Thomas Jefferson,  Robert Livingston, the U.S. Minister to France negotiated the Louisiana Purchase with Napoleon Bonaparte in 1803. The land purchased was 828,800 square miles. The following year, President Jefferson sent out an  expedition to explore the newly acquired western land.I  really can't say enough wonderful things about this terrific DVD.  Lewis & Clark, A Journey of the Corps of Discovery is an awesome look at that expedition, that begin in 1804 and ended in 1806.It was  beautifully filmed and the dialogue introduced the gorgeous scenery and  the majestic sites that were seen by the men on this journey.  I can't even imagine how thrilling and terrifying it was to come across huge snow covered mountains and rivers that they had to cross. The Indians, that they met on the journey, were mostly helpful in supplying food and sometimes they were able to help with directions.  Yes, they also ran into some hostile Indians.After the return of the expedition, the story goes on to tell about the lives of the men after their glorious, but exhausting venture was finished. I found the information about William Clark and Meriwether Lewis to be especially interesting. The dialogue by actors, Hal Halbrook and Alan Arkin was terrific and added a lot of character to the story!If you ever visit President Thomas Jefferson's home, Monticello, you'll see some of the artifacts that Lewis & Clark brought back.

The film actually follows, from location to location, the movement of Lewis and Clark's expidition. Hal Holbrook's narration is interspersed with bits from the men's journals read by very capable actors. In short, it truly played like a superb adventure film.In as much detail as possible, we get to see it all. The journey, the relationships, the anxieties and the triumphs; From the bonds and battles with various indian tribes, to Meriwether Lewis' depressions and ultimate suicide. The only possible negative comment, that the film was a whopping 4 hours, in the end turns out to be an asset. If the film had been shorter, details would have had to be sacrificed which in the end gave the film such a powerful excitement.Even for the historical documentary skeptic, one viewing of L&amp;C will change your mind.

They took thirty men up the Missouri River into uncharted territory looking for the mythical ""Northwest Passage,"" which others had searched for for three hundred years.  They mapped the land, and catalogued the animals and plants.  They befriended Indians and made promises successive generations would ultimately break.  They lived off-of-the-land, or traded with natives for whatever they couldn't hunt or catch.The trek took two-and-a-half years.  They traveled in spring and summer and put-up for the winter.  During one lengthy encampment, they dined on nothing but elk for months - because they wouldn't eat the local salmon which was plentiful.They faced death on numerous occasions, yet came back suffering only one casualty (due to appendicitis).  All of the men (except for a slave) were awarded 300 acres by the U.S. government.  Lewis & Clark each earned 1,600.  Lewis was manic-depressive; and his paranoia, which was controlled during their journey, revived to torment him after his return.  His friend, Clark, lived a long life.  Lewis, haunted by demons, committed suicide.President Thomas Jefferson, who had bought the Louisiana Territory from Napoleon, was a true visionary.  But he was derided for the purchase.  He waited years for the vindication that Lewis & Clark would eventually bring him.The movie's live footage of majestic scenery is awe-inspiring.

Thinking back, I remember seeing historical markers and signs for the &quot;Lewis and Clark Trail&quot; along various highways in the Midwest but, prior to viewing this film, I didn't really know where they went or what incredible hardships and risks they faced.  This excellent documentary gives the full picture of these two explorers, including their personal lives and background.  It also gives due credit to the corps of men (and two women) who accompanied them.Tape #1 traces their route as far as the Rocky Mountains, while tape #2 picks up from there and continues to the Pacific Ocean and back, with follow-up on what happened to some of the participants after the expedition was over. (Interestingly, many of the crew were unable to settle back into &quot;civilized&quot; routine again, and went West to become mountain men or settlers.  Lewis himself, who seems to have had some sort of bi-polar disorder that ran in the family, fell into a deep depression and committed suicide -- a tragic ending to a brave life.)I found the presentation to be very well-balanced, giving the Native American viewpoints as well as the written records from the expedition journals.  Some of the Native tribes have oral traditions about meeting Lewis and Clark which have been passed down through the generations, and it was fascinating to hear their perspectives. The film also gives proper credit to the role of Sacajewea, the Indian woman who accompanied them on much of the journey.  Her presence on the expedition (along with her newly-born son) helped prove to possibly hostile tribes that Lewis and Clark came in peace, since a war party would not take a woman along.  There was also a black slave on the expedition, and his story is well-covered, too.  On the technical end, the photography is magnificent, giving a good feel for the awe that the expediiion must have felt upon seeing these sights for the first time.

I have seen hundreds of documentaries over the years but few have made me almost forget that what I was watching and hearing was fact, not fiction. Ken Burns, the director, producer, and jack-of-trades behind this production has put forth a yeoman's effort nearly rivaling in vision what the explorers themselves were guided by. The film editing is superb--giving the story a variety of narrative voices needed to sustain it over such a lengthy project.

Even if you are not a history buff, you will enjoy and appreciate this film. It is instructive on many levels, both  practical and spiritual.

Before Neil Armstrong and ""Buzz"" Aldrin"" walked on the moon, Lewis and clark began a journey of equal importance over 150 years before. We are now approaching the bicentennial of that voyage. This journey is equal to the United States quest of the moon. In the video they commented that during the Apollo 13 emergency JIm Lovell and crew were in constant communication with mission control in Houston. Lewis and Clark were completeley isolated from Washington. Any communication would take weeks to travel.In 1803 Thomas Jefferson Purchased the Louisiana Territory from Napoleon. Jefferson Comissioned his friend Merriwether Lewis to explore this new territory. Being a naturalist, Jefferson wanted Lewis to record all of the nature of this new area. His main purpose was to discover the northwest passage.In 1804 Lewis and his partner William Clark set out along the missouri river. Ken Burns does a great job of capturing the beauty of this area. The Buffalo herds today were not any where near the size of the herds when lewis and clark first saw them. They also saw prarie chickens as well as prarie dogs. Lewis sent a couple of prarie dogs back to Jefferson.Lewis and Clark never found the northwest passage, but they returned as heroes. Ken Burns includes what happened to Lewis and Clark after their journey, including the tragic suicide of Merriwether Lewis.
