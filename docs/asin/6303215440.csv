I loved it then and since purchasing and watching it again, nothing has changed.Vatican 2 is enthralling. I am not a religious person but have always had a fasciantion with nuns and the lives they have chosen to lead. Brides of Christ shows different nuns and how they deal with the change, and the obedience required when choosing this life as a vocation.Mother Ambrose tried her best to change while maintaining her faith, Sister Agnus is againt all changes and wishes for the Church to keep all of it's traditions and rituals, Sister Paul is unsure of what she wants and Sister Catherine hopes for the Church to change at an even faster pace...the last straw for her is when the Pope announces he is against birth control.So, yes, I highly reccomend this mini-series.

364802,A3FHSLWEMH7JD8,6303215440,"Elizabeth G. Melillo ""gloriana""","[7, 8]","The brilliance of this series, where conflicts within the Roman Catholic religious life are treated through incidents in the lives of Sisters and students, may not be captured by all at first glance. The obvious (and superbly handled) theme is adjusting to drastic changes in monastic and Church life. Yet there is a greater depth still in less glaring themes, which mirrored what many Sisters faced.The community of Spirito Santo is depicted as quite exceptional, with a high intellectual standard and, even in the days before the 'old ways' are abandoned, a degree of warmth and interaction between most Sisters which is beyond what some communities would have experienced. Various Sisters illustrate shortcomings (which one can see only in hindsight) which had drastic implications for the Church at large, not only the religious life (which too often was in its dying days.) For example, the wise, truly caring Mother Ambrose, who at first seems to wish to involve the viewpoints of all Sisters in community decisions, illustrates a very common response of the time - valuing 'unity' (such as that shown in forcing all Sisters into the modified habit) at all costs. It may not be obvious to those who did not have close associations with religious Orders, but, during the period, far more drastic, sometimes devastating, 'options' than a modified garb became permissible, then an unwritten rule, in the name of the 'ways of the community.'Diane/Sister Catherine is an interesting, if exasperating, character, because, initially, it is to the congregation's credit that one who questioned constantly, often in a superior, smug, and self absorbed fashion, was not dismissed for a lack of 'obedience.' One would wonder why someone of her sort entered religious life in the first place, though there is a strong hint that she overestimates her own intellectual gifts and thinks herself to be quite a prize. Catherine's overall story points out traps into which many Sisters fell.For example, much of the conflict surrounding Humanae Vitae (the topic of one episode), which was stirred by celibates, arose from anger that the pope's statement was against the recommendations of his committee - the Religious protested more because of collegiality or a sense of 'democracy', where the married (who did not depart in droves, even if they did not obey the directives) largely were not concerned with such consultations. Catherine's ire is not only directed at Rome, but at married people who don't 'take her side up on' the prohibition on birth control. She is too blinded by her own agenda to see the implicit condescension, nor, for all her academic intelligence, does she have the minimal wordly wisdom which would have prevented her from commenting on, let alone interfering in, anything as private as a couple's marital practise.Another solid image is how many Sisters, looking to show acceptance and dispel a supposed image of their being inapproachable and rigid (though most Spirito Santo Sisters, from the first frame of the film, are anything but), ignored prudence. It is perfectly understandable when student Frances is sent to attend her mother's registry office wedding - yet neither Sisters Catherine nor Paul can see that their attending, then dancing the twist in long habits at the reception, could make them seem vaguely pathetic (look at the queens of cool...), as well as be taken for a protest against teachings of the Church which they represent. The mothers at the school, who avoid Frances' mother, indeed seem hard and uncharitable, but the dimension that is not presented (and which Sisters well might forget, because their desire to seem tolerant could cause tunnel vision) is that parents may not wish their children to see a fuss over one who, to their minds, departed from the commitment of sacramental marriage.Sister Paul's story was especially insightful. Non-Catholics, or Catholics who were not that aware of matters theological at the time, can miss that this is not merely a tale of a young woman who suddenly is questioning whether her decision to enter a convent should be permanent. In the aftermath of Gaudium et Spes, a document which presented a far from new idea about the 'universal call to holiness,' too many religious minimised the value of their own lives, seeing the 'only call as baptism.' Sister Paul is a delightful young teacher, who seems perfectly happy in convent life, but who is not only dealing with her first strong attraction to a man (whom she cannot see does not return her love, but is using her to 'get back at' the Church as he departs the priesthood in bitterness) but with the sudden new idea that there is no real value in religious life, sees only that she'd serve God just as well as a wife and mother. Ambrose's comment captures a great deal of a situation which many Sisters of sanguine disposition faced: Paul entered at 19 more because it was 'what everyone expected,' and 'never really made a decision in her life.' Her ultimate decision is to remain a religious, but she did not see that she had not developed maturity until confronted with the conflict.The single deficiency in the presentation was that Sisters who are of more conservative bent are shown as being so because of defects of character rather than conviction. This was a very common idea in religious life at that time - and indeed a manipulative tactic to push conformity. (For example, Sisters who preferred to retain religious garb were convinced that they must want to keep people at a distance - those who wished common prayer schedules were written off as immature.) Though Sister Agnes is an intelligent, learned woman, she is of a very trying, domineering personality, and it seems implicit that her desire for the 'old ways' is based on her difficulty in dealing with others. I was sorry that there was no episode from her point of view. The other 'conservative' Sister who is any major emphasis is pathetic - an emotional wreck who breaks down before the community, sobbing that she wants to be told what to do and does not want to make her own decisions, and then makes a suicide attempt. One could come away from a series which otherwise is notably frank and realistic with the impression that more conservative Sisters were either dreadful personalities or mentally ill.Of course, there is an element of pathos in the final product as well. The efforts of the Sisters at the time are understandable - seeking to adapt and have a fresh spirit, and to become more available to those whom they served. As time has shown, the very climate of 'options', supposed democracy and dialogue which cut out voices which did not fit the party line and thought such voices inferior, and the conformity, no less than that of the old ways even if it was called being 'community minded' rather than 'obedience,' sounded the death knoll for the positive religious life one sees in this film.",5,Outstanding dramatic

Vatican II, began in 1962 when the newly elected Pope John XXII called Catholic bishops around the world to meet and reflect on the place of the Roman Catholic Church in the contemporary world.  The idea was to open the windows of the Church and let in some fresh air.  This meant the decentralization of authority, the introduction of the local language into the church liturgy, and in general a new spirit of ecumenism.  Religious orders were encouraged to make decisions about their daily lives and to examine their rituals and customs for elements that had become irrelevant in the modern world.  However, the traditionally conservative hierarchy of the Catholic Church in Australia did not move quickly to embrace such reforms and it was the nuns who emerged as the leaders in the spiritual and educational revolution Down Under.""Brides of Christ"" is a six-part 1991 mini-series set in the convent of Santo Spirito in Sydney during the turbulent 1960s.  The convent is also a boarding school for young girls.  Each chapter is named for one of the characters and while I though that this would be the story of six different nuns, some of the episodes focus more on the young girls at the school.  In retrospect ""Brides of Christ"" focus on three generational pairs.  Mother Ambrose (Sandy Gore) heads the convent with her stern right hand, Sister Agnes (Brenda Fricker).  Joining the convent and becoming the best of friends are Diane (Josephine Byrnes) and Veronica (Lisa Hensley), who become Sister Catherine and Sister Paul respectively.  Amongst the girls the two who stand out are Frances Heffernan (Naomi Watts) and Rosemary Fitzgerald (Kym Wilson), although Mary Maloney (Pat Bishop) becomes a pivotal character at the end as well.Episode 1, ""Diane,"" introduces the key character in the series.  Diane is about to get married and has even slept with her fianc&eacute; when she decides to call off the wedding and enter the convent instead.  As Sister Catherine goal is to control her ego, but this is going to prove to be a major problem.  Although such special friendships are frowned upon by the domineering Sister Agnes, Sister Catherine becomes close to Sister Paul, another new postulate.  But the bigger problem is that Sister Catherine wants to argue with not only Sister Agnes about Catholic theology, but to challenge the teachings of Anselm and Aquinas as well.  However, the reforms of Vatican II make her radical thoughts more acceptable than ever in the Church's history.Episode 2, ""Frances,"" finds Sisters Catherine and Paul are now both teaching at the convent and focuses on the friendship that has formed between young Frances and Rosemary.  Frances's father and mother are separated, and when her mother wants to get remarried, Frances worries that her mother will go to Hell for getting a divorce.Episode 3, ""Ambrose,"" is about changes at Santo Spirito presided over by the Reverend Mother.  The two most important ones are a new lay teacher, Ian McGregor (Philip Quast), who teaches economics, and the adoption of a new habit by the sisters.  Not only Sister Agnes, but also Sister Philomena (Caroline Gilmer) do not want to accept change and McGregor proves to be too radical for the parents of the girls.Episode 4, ""Rosemary,"" finds Sister Agnes's lessons on self respect lost on young Rosemary.  After one of the girls is expelled from the boarding school for having sex, Rosemary becomes promiscuous.  She also has a crush on Mary Maloney's sister, Dominic (Russell Crowe), whose number comes up for Vietnam.Episode 5, ""Paul,"" finds Sister Paul developing feelings for her old friend, Jack (Simon Burke), a radical priest who leaves the church because it is not changing quickly enough.  Sister Paul decides to leave the convent, but maintains her vow of chastity while she tries to figure out what she really wants to do with her life.Episode 6, ""Catherine,"" brings us back full circle, as it is now Sister Catherine who questions staying in the convent after the Pope's new encyclical on birth control is released.  Mother Ambrose is in Rome and Sister Agnes is running Santo Spirito, which does not make things any easier.  Young Frances has strong feelings about the subjects of birth control and abortion as well, which brings her into conflict with her friend Mary, who announces her desire to become one of the penguins.I am reminded somewhat of ""The Trouble With Angels"" by ""Brides of Christ,"" not so much in terms of the convent/boarding school setting but more because of the careful balance between respect for the sisters and the intimate portrait of their lives.  The key thing here is that the characters are all fully realized, and even the minor characters have specific functions to fulfill in life at the convent.  I was inclined not to like the resolution of the conflict because of the point it is making, but if Sister Agnes is okay with it then I have little room to complain.  Overall, I liked the story lines focusing on the Sister Catherine and Sister Paul (the fact that Byrnes and Hensley are good friends off screen helps) and even on the Old Guard nuns more than I did those about the youngsters, but I understand how things have to be marketed on television, even on the other half of the world.Obviously Catholics and those raised in the Church who remember those times will find these stories resonating more than those of different faiths.  But these stories really are more about the characters than the issues. Although ""Brides of Christ"" is set in the 1960s most of the issues remain relevant and represent inherent tensions between the Church and those living in more liberal democratic nations, The mini-series is quite captivating.  The sparse extras on the two-DVD set are all screen shots, but they do note that Watts and Crowe have gone on to somewhat successful screen careers.",5,The Sisters of Santo Spirito deal with the

364810,A308QC9XPFHFGJ,6303215440,"Malfoyfan ""Cath""","[1, 1]","I saw this mini-series originally on a cable TV channel and then sought it out on VHS (I've had it for a while, obviously).  Even with commercials it was mesmerizing, drawing me into the story immediately.  I think the scene that really grabbed me was when Diane/Catherine was a little girl trying on her mother's wedding dress and jewelry and she sees the figurine of the Virgin come ""alive"" for a moment. The series has excellent writing and acting.  All the characters, even the more peripheral ones, are fully realized.  Some of the actors were familiar to me (Russell Crowe and Naomi Watts - both exuding star quality even as young actors - especially, but also Brenda Fricker), and others I had never seen before, but all were first-rate. The ones that stand out are the actresses who play Catherine and the Reverend Mother of the order.I'm not Catholic, so some of the issues in the program were new to me and I found them fascinating. It must have been difficult for Catholics in that era to deal with all the changes in the church.I also thought that the balance between the girls' stories and the nuns' stories was well done.  I loved the ending, where the story is both brought full circle and propelled into the future.All in all, this series is well worth your time for whatever reason you may choose to watch it.

364811,A68QXK0H88J4I,6303215440,matt,"[9, 14]","I viewed all of the episodes one day last week when I was sick, and perhaps that dampened the mood of my opinion of the series. I read the other reviews and on most parts agree whole heartedly that the acting is top notch and the script an accurate portrayal of the crises that many monastics experienced in the time leading up to Vatican Two and especially thereafter regarding the meaning and substance of not only their personal vocation, but the value of the faith and Church at large. Brides of Christ also shows the Catholic societal milieu wherein the Church held an authority over the faithful somewhat unknown in our time.OK, READ NO MORE IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE ENDING SPOILED.My main qualm with the series centers around the way the writers portrayed the crises of faith for the cast. In general, and I think actually this applies to every case, those who remained faithful to the Church's teaching were portrayed as either nave and simple minded or strict and rigid, unable to live in the ""real world."" I have the suspicion that this was part of the writers' agenda and bias, but who knows. Moreover, those who were portrayed positively in the film were the rebels who disobeyed the Church and were ""with it,"" or simply those who wised up and threw off the habit or the novitiate. This is my only issue in an otherwise very entertaining series that I will watch again sometime (maybe when I am not ill).One true point that the film made was how the legitimate and progressive interpretation of the spirit of V2 that sought to give personal choice was used by the liberals to, ironically, strictly enforce their own agenda to rid the Church of authority and traditionalism in most forms. It seems to this reviewer that this is one of the tendencies of reform movements is that they lose sight of their spirit and become just as tyrannical and despotic as their supposed oppressors, e.g. communism and most academia. I would argue that in truth the Orthodox and Catholic traditions are actually more tolerant and liberal than the liberals, but that's another story.I know several nuns and ex-nuns from the era and they also watched it with similar feelings, even though one of them is of the liberal type to begin with and left about 15 years after V2. Yes, going from Latin to ""Kumbaya Lord"" was indeed a huge shift for them all, along with the forced decisions that some of the more ""progressive"" abbesses and bishops shoved down the pipe.",3,Ch Ch Changes,1157241600,"09 3, 2006",2006,2450,"['viewed', 'episodes', 'one', 'day', 'last', 'week', 'when', 'was', 'sick', 'perhaps', 'dampened', 'mood', 'opinion', 'series', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'most', 'parts', 'agree', 'whole', 'heartedly', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'script', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'crises', 'many', 'monastics', 'experienced', 'time', 'leading', 'up', 'Vatican', 'Two', 'especially', 'thereafter', 'regarding', 'meaning', 'substance', 'not', 'only', 'personal', 'vocation', 'value', 'faith', 'Church', 'large', 'Brides', 'Christ', 'also', 'Catholic', 'societal', 'milieu', 'wherein', 'Church', 'held', 'authority', 'faithful', 'somewhat', 'unknown', 'time.OK', 'READ', 'NO', 'MORE', 'IF', 'YOU', 'DO', 'NOT', 'WANT', 'THE', 'ENDING', 'SPOILED.My', 'main', 'qualm', 'series', 'centers', 'way', 'writers', 'portrayed', 'crises', 'faith', 'cast', 'general', 'think', 'actually', 'applies', 'case', 'who', 'remained', 'faithful', 'Church', 'teaching', 'were', 'portrayed', 'nave', 'simple', 'minded', 'strict', 'rigid', 'unable', 'live', 'real', 'world', 'have', 'suspicion', 'was', 'part', 'writers', 'agenda', 'bias', 'who', 'Moreover', 'who', 'were', 'portrayed', 'positively', 'film', 'were', 'rebels', 'who', 'disobeyed', 'Church', 'were', 'simply', 'who', 'wised', 'up', 'threw', 'off', 'habit', 'novitiate', 'only', 'issue', 'otherwise', 'very', 'entertaining', 'series', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'sometime', 'maybe', 'when', 'am', 'not', 'ill', '.One', 'true', 'point', 'film', 'made', 'was', 'how', 'legitimate', 'progressive', 'interpretation', 'spirit', 'V2', 'sought', 'give', 'personal', 'choice', 'was', 'used', 'liberals', 'ironically', 'strictly', 'enforce', 'own', 'agenda', 'rid', 'Church', 'authority', 'traditionalism', 'most', 'forms', 'reviewer', 'one', 'tendencies', 'reform', 'movements', 'lose', 'sight', 'spirit', 'become', 'just', 'tyrannical', 'despotic', 'supposed', 'oppressors', 'e.g', 'communism', 'most', 'academia', 'would', 'argue', 'truth', 'Orthodox', 'Catholic', 'traditions', 'are', 'actually', 'more', 'tolerant', 'liberal', 'liberals', 'story.I', 'know', 'several', 'nuns', 'ex-nuns', 'era', 'also', 'watched', 'similar', 'feelings', 'even', 'one', 'liberal', 'type', 'begin', 'left', '15', 'years', 'V2', 'Yes', 'going', 'Latin', 'Kumbaya', 'Lord', 'was', 'indeed', 'huge', 'shift', 'forced', 'decisions', 'more', 'progressive', 'abbesses', 'bishops', 'shoved', 'down', 'pipe']",Brides of Christ VHS
364812,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,6303215440,William Timothy Lukeman,"[0, 0]","This Australian TV mini-series remains one of the finest I've ever seen -- as rich & complex as any novel, with the lives of many fascinating characters interwoven over the space of several crucial years in Catholicism, the time of Vatican II & the changes it brought. The stories of several nuns parallel & intersect those of several schoolgirls in their care, as the pressing issues of the day are explored with sensitivity & nuance. There are no outright villains, no spotless heroines -- rather, we're offered something rare in popular entertainment these days, the lives of women as three-dimensional human beings, not just sexual objects -- although sexuality is one of the divisive issues they explore.Some reviewers have mistakenly called the series an attack on religion in general & the Catholic Church in particular. I can't see that. For example, the essentially conservative but compassionate Mother Ambrose is presented as a caring, sympathetic woman, sometimes troubled by the rules she lives by, sometimes helpless to aid those most in need of it, but always striving to to do her best for others without condescension. And while Sister Catherine is in many ways the primary viewpoint character, with her sharp & questioning mind on full display, we also see how she sometimes fails as well. Even the stern Sister Agnes is far more than the tough ""top sergeant"" she initially seems, while Sister Paul is clearly a born teacher with a heart as big as the world -- a heart made for breaking at one point.And so it is with all the characters, both nuns & schoolgirls. Even for a lapsed Catholic like myself, long since in the agnostic camp, the depiction of faith in all its light & shadows is quite moving. These aren't blind fanatics, but women called by some inner need & desire to fulfill their lives through the spirit. Yet they're often brought up against the constraints & limitations of that path, as well as its possibilities, with each individual dealing with her situation in her own way.The schoolgirls are equally diverse, coming of age in the mid-1960s, with all the ferment of the times swirling around them. Again, each one is a distinct individual, struggling to cope with the demands of both faith & approaching adulthood, as well as their own awakening sexuality. But it isn't just the physical aspect of sex that's examined, it's the emotional aspect as well. Most of all, the difficulty of becoming one's own person is shown with understanding & empathy, without any easy answers appearing at the last minute.As I said before, what makes this series especially welcome is its emphasis on women in a world made by & run by men -- but they're never solely defined by men. If anything, they're defined by their relationships with one another, in a world men can't enter & seldom try to understand. Feminist? Yes, in that the women are seen first & foremost as themselves, seeking to become whole human beings -- and that's not only feminist, but just plain human. It's what we're all trying to do, isn't it?I see that this DVD is currently out of print. That's a shame, because it deserves to be readily available to thoughtful, discerning viewers. My single complaint is that I wish it could have been at least twice as long -- these compelling women remain with you, and I would dearly love to learn more about them.
