562203,A27VMEB55OY9LS,B00004ZET8,Kathy-W,"[0, 0]","I own most Secret Garden albums and love them all in one way or another. Whether you choose to call their music fusion, New Age, world, folk, neo-classical, or just contemporary instrumental, they have generated some marvelous and enduring music in the years they've been around. So now we come to the DVD.While I am thrilled to own a DVD concert of this group, I can't say I was blown away. The performers are great and so are the compositions, don't get me wrong. Rolf grins like an idiot on a number of occasions and looks like a kid in a candy store when it comes to the keyboard-prominent songs (he is, after all, a very decent pianist). Fionnuala, however, looks scared stiff on the first few songs. This is understandable but slightly sad given her immense musical abilities - she needn't have worried about ruining the night.Any fan will tell you that Secret Garden live appearances are rare - even in a busy year, they perform perhaps a dozen times in concert. I don't begrudge them this if the trade-off is solid, thoughtful, methodical albums, but that is the stark fact about them. Therefore, this DVD is definitely the closest many of us will ever get to seeing them in concert.The main problem I see is that there is nothing much new here. Particularly early on in the show, this concert has the distinct feeling of being a ""showcase"" (a phenomenon common among new talent or pop singers - every hair is in place and every song must be perfect). There is basically no room for improvisation, although this is an innate feature of their songs (I'm not complaining because these songs are already very polished, but you always have an expectation of some song variation in a live setting). Some of the percussion seems a little different, but there are no notable solo riffs. I was really hoping to see Fionnuala get sawing away on her fiddle just once, but it didn't happen. She plays beautifully, but I have an inkling that she might have had a little more fun if she had some ""wiggle room"" somewhere. I also would have dearly loved to see Rolf add some flourishes to a quiet piano moment...but it, too, didn't happen.Again, I'm not actually criticizing the songs. I love these songs and the musicians are perfectly capable and talented at what they do. Anuna is strong at all times and that size of choir was very appropriate for the instrument ratio in this somewhat smaller concert setting.As others have said, the lighting was often cluttered and unnecessary, but keep in mind that this concert was done in Norway; stage sensibilities probably differ a little from country to country, either due to cultural differences or just variations in lighting tastes. I'm not trying to excuse it, but the concert wasn't actually ruined for me because of it.The documentaries are EXTENSIVE and are actually about as interesting as the concert itself. The menus are clever and artsy, if not a bit dated. I do recommend buying this concert, but like other reviews said, there isn't much new here. Mind you, I love the songs they chose for this, but they really tried to play these as heard on the albums (a point which some people will like and some will not).By the way, some reviews were complaining about voices sounding muted. I would remind everyone that there IS more than one sound choice on this DVD. One option worked very well on my TV and one did not. Experiment around and see if you come to the same conclusion.",4,"Fun music, and it's very nice to see Rolf and Fi on stage, but....",1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,3430,"['own', 'most', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'albums', 'love', 'one', 'way', 'choose', 'call', 'music', 'fusion', 'New', 'Age', 'world', 'folk', 'neo-classical', 'just', 'contemporary', 'instrumental', 'have', 'generated', 'marvelous', 'enduring', 'music', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'around', 'So', 'now', 'come', 'DVD.While', 'am', 'thrilled', 'own', 'DVD', 'concert', 'group', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'performers', 'are', 'great', 'so', 'are', 'compositions', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Rolf', 'idiot', 'number', 'occasions', 'kid', 'candy', 'store', 'when', 'keyboard-prominent', 'songs', 'very', 'decent', 'pianist', 'Fionnuala', 'however', 'scared', 'stiff', 'first', 'few', 'songs', 'understandable', 'slightly', 'sad', 'given', 'immense', 'musical', 'abilities', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'worried', 'ruining', 'night.Any', 'fan', 'will', 'tell', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'live', 'appearances', 'are', 'rare', 'even', 'busy', 'year', 'perform', 'perhaps', 'dozen', 'times', 'concert', 'do', ""n't"", 'begrudge', 'trade-off', 'solid', 'thoughtful', 'methodical', 'albums', 'stark', 'fact', 'Therefore', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'closest', 'many', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'seeing', 'concert.The', 'main', 'problem', 'see', 'nothing', 'much', 'new', 'here', 'Particularly', 'early', 'show', 'concert', 'distinct', 'feeling', 'being', 'showcase', 'phenomenon', 'common', 'new', 'talent', 'pop', 'singers', 'hair', 'place', 'song', 'must', 'be', 'perfect', 'basically', 'room', 'improvisation', 'innate', 'feature', 'songs', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'songs', 'are', 'already', 'very', 'polished', 'always', 'have', 'expectation', 'song', 'variation', 'live', 'setting', 'percussion', 'little', 'different', 'are', 'notable', 'solo', 'riffs', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'see', 'Fionnuala', 'get', 'sawing', 'away', 'fiddle', 'just', 'once', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'beautifully', 'have', 'inkling', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'fun', 'had', 'wiggle', 'room', 'somewhere', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'dearly', 'loved', 'see', 'Rolf', 'add', 'flourishes', 'quiet', 'piano', 'moment', 'too', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen.Again', ""'m"", 'not', 'actually', 'criticizing', 'songs', 'love', 'songs', 'musicians', 'are', 'perfectly', 'capable', 'talented', 'what', 'do', 'Anuna', 'strong', 'times', 'size', 'choir', 'was', 'very', 'appropriate', 'instrument', 'ratio', 'somewhat', 'smaller', 'concert', 'setting.As', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'lighting', 'was', 'often', 'cluttered', 'unnecessary', 'keep', 'mind', 'concert', 'was', 'done', 'Norway', 'stage', 'probably', 'differ', 'little', 'country', 'country', 'either', 'due', 'cultural', 'differences', 'just', 'variations', 'lighting', 'tastes', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'excuse', 'concert', 'was', ""n't"", 'actually', 'ruined', 'it.The', 'documentaries', 'are', 'EXTENSIVE', 'are', 'actually', 'as', 'interesting', 'concert', 'menus', 'are', 'clever', 'artsy', 'not', 'bit', 'dated', 'do', 'recommend', 'buying', 'concert', 'other', 'reviews', 'said', ""n't"", 'much', 'new', 'here', 'Mind', 'love', 'songs', 'chose', 'really', 'tried', 'play', 'heard', 'albums', 'point', 'people', 'will', 'like', 'will', 'not', 'way', 'reviews', 'were', 'complaining', 'voices', 'sounding', 'muted', 'would', 'remind', 'everyone', 'more', 'one', 'sound', 'choice', 'DVD', 'One', 'option', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'TV', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'Experiment', 'see', 'come', 'same', 'conclusion']",N/A

After watching this DVD, I went out and buy all their first 3 albums(Songs from a Secret Garden,White Stones and Dawn of a New Cenury), the music is that good... How can you not embrace songs like Poeme, Hymn to Hope, Passacaglia, Sona,Dawn of a New Century (and others). These songs keep playing in my head while I am at work, I just can't get enough of them, it's insane! The picture and sound is real DVD quality, so clear and so precise. Excellent arrangement on stage from a small orchestra and with guests like Anuna and Karen Matheson, you just can't go wrong. The DVD features 2 small behind the scenes about the making of their first 3 albums and some other interesting articles.I wish they have the song ""Illumination"" included in there since it has such a beautiful and haunting melody.

To say it is near CD quality is way off base. Maybe it's time for you to get a new sound system. I've had this DVD for over a year (or two?) and played it many times to the enjoyment of family and friends. The 5.1 surround is excellent as well as the sound quality of the music and vocals.

562208,A3OMDSHIGTFY84,B00004ZET8,"S. Fennell ""pianistcritic""","[80, 81]","For the uninitiated, &quot;Secret Garden&quot; is the fantastic duo of Rolf Lovland, (composer, keyboards), and Fionnuala Sherry (violin). He's Norwegian, she's Irish, and together, they have created some of the most remarkably heartfelt and melodic music of recent years.  Combining elements of celtic, classical, new age, and pop, this is music for the romantic visionary.  That said, let it be known that this DVD is an extraordinary look at the group, on and off stage.  In addition to the hour and a half concert, (which I believe is 30 minutes longer than the VHS version of the same show), you also get 2 different thirty-minute documentaries, a complete discography with brief audio samples of every track on the albums, 2 music videos, biographies, photo gallery, an optional running narrative for the concert, and a really cool 3-D animated intro before any of the above comes on the screen.  The concert itself is nothing short of phenomenal.  If you are a fan of their albums, rest assured that nothing is lost in the transition of these songs to a &quot;live&quot; setting. (Yes, the original CDs made use of a full orchestra, but the smaller one used in the concert is equally effective. Choral group, &quot;Anuna&quot;, makes an appearance, as well.)  I love to see an artist become totally &quot;lost in the moment&quot; during a performance, and that's what you are treated to, here.  It's obvious that Rolf and Fionnuala love what they do.  With a complete concert, and so many &quot;extras&quot; included, this is truly a bargain.  I can't recommend it highly enough. By the way, the track listing included on a previous review was not complete, and was probably based on the VHS version.  Here is the complete song listing for the DVD version:  1. Intro 2. The Rap  3. Song from a Secret Garden  4. Pastorale  5. Children of the River 6. Sigma  7. Nocturne  8. Steps  9. Passacaglia  10. Sona  11. Poeme  12. Moving  13. Adagio  14. Windancer  15.
