But will watch it again because it was fantastic! Anthony Sher holds his own against Flemyng's diva performance. But, still you love him! He is afraid, happy, sad, angry, and passionate: all at once! You care about each character. They are human. We all know someone like them and while we might not always like each character (and they don't always like each other) every second of the movie you learn to love them as they learn to love not only each other, but themselves as well.

I don't have much to add that hasn't already been said by others who love this movie, except that I don't understand how anybody can see Tonio as a repulsive character. It's the only time I've been extremely grateful that a gay role was played by a straight actor, because no actor on earth could have done it as well as Jason Flemyng did. It's a perfect performance.Although the AIDS element is a little dated, everything else about this movie is about as perfect and as timeless as a movie can be. And having a dated topic is no defect at all. If a movie is great it's great... period. Gone with the Wind, The Miracle Worker, and many others prove that. This is currently my favorite movie.

Flemyng's portrayal of a ballet dancer stricken by AIDS packs a wallop of a punch... It is a POWERFUL performance.The story is about how two men who are incredibly different manage to come together, yet there is another story that is more powerful here:  The strength required to carry on in the face of an illness that is wiping out everyone around you.  This is one of the greatest films made about the AIDS epidemic, and it shows the impact of the disease upon the ballet world of the 80's and 90's.  The dance scene near the end of the film is a victorious refusal to succumb to death.  Antonio's (Flemyng's) courage and determination to perform the ballet is as inspiring as anything you are ever likely to see in any film.

The lead ""charismatic"" actor, Jason Flemyng, playing the dancer Tonio, has AIDS and has seen a lover and a best friend both die of AIDS.  After this he meets an AIDS therapist, and though they start off on the wrong foot, albeit film's cliche of ""meet cute"", the therapist pursues the dancer and the dancer quickly succumbs.  But these aren't two-dimensional characters, but guys with personal histories and demons which both actors are fully capable of bringing off.  These characters come alive as real people, a credit to both actors.  Overall the AIDS dilemna is a tiresome one, however the screenplay takes a different approach with this couple because the guys wouldn't have become a couple at all if it wasn't for AIDS being a contributing factor: it's like AIDS is the third lead in the film.
