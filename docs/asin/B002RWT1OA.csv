The last song in Snoopy the Musical Just One Person always makes me sad but in this special the last song Happiness always makes me happy. I love the songs but I only wish I could find the music for the TV special and not the Broadway version. My favorite is the Home on the Range song when everyone is yelling at each other it's so funny to watch. I think Robert Towers does a great Snoopy voice. Great special and I really enjoy it. I have it on video but it's not a good picture.

Of all the shows I've seen, performed in, read about, or lectured about, there are few that hold the emotional pull of You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown. I'm sure part of it is because of my affection for the Peanuts comic strip itself, but I also love the sweet, tuneful simplicity of Clark Gesner's songs, and the wry wit of the Charles Schulz vignettes that form the spine of the show. The 1999 Broadway revival of You're a Good Man Charlie Brown left me cold, mostly because it was trying to jazz things up and expand the show, and seemed to lose sight of what made the show appealing in the first place.Now we have the 1985 animated special on DVD. I remember watching it when it first aired and being less than impressed, but when I popped in the DVD upon its arrival, I was thoroughly delighted. The special has the polished look and feel of the 1970s Charlie Brown specials, as opposed to some of the later specials that seemed a bit slapdash.Because it needed to fit into an hour-long TV slot, the show has been cut down quite a bit, removing some rather fun numbers, such as Linus's ""My Blanket and Me"" and Snoopy's ""The Red Baron."" But what's left is charming, and very engagingly animated. I actually laughed out loud at some of the clever bits. There was something about seeing the actual Snoopy, as opposed to an adult in a white turtle neck, that made his parts a bit more effective. And including Woodstock, particularly during the song ""Snoopy,"" was an inspired touch.",5,"Great Music, Great Fun",1264636800,"01 28, 2010",2010,1519,"['musicals', 'just', 'stick', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'performed', 'read', 'lectured', 'are', 'few', 'hold', 'emotional', 'pull', ""'re"", 'Good', 'Man', 'Charlie', 'Brown', ""'m"", 'sure', 'part', 'affection', 'Peanuts', 'comic', 'strip', 'also', 'love', 'sweet', 'tuneful', 'simplicity', 'Clark', 'Gesner', 'songs', 'wry', 'wit', 'Charles', 'Schulz', 'form', 'spine', 'show', '1999', 'Broadway', 'revival', ""'re"", 'Good', 'Man', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'left', 'cold', 'mostly', 'was', 'trying', 'jazz', 'things', 'up', 'expand', 'show', 'seemed', 'lose', 'sight', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'appealing', 'first', 'place.Now', 'have', '1985', 'animated', 'special', 'DVD', 'remember', 'watching', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'being', 'less', 'impressed', 'when', 'popped', 'DVD', 'arrival', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'delighted', 'special', 'polished', 'look', 'feel', '1970s', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'specials', 'opposed', 'later', 'specials', 'seemed', 'bit', 'needed', 'fit', 'hour-long', 'TV', 'slot', 'show', 'been', 'cut', 'down', 'quite', 'bit', 'removing', 'rather', 'fun', 'numbers', 'such', 'Linus', 'Blanket', 'Me', 'Snoopy', 'Red', 'Baron', 'what', 'left', 'charming', 'very', 'engagingly', 'animated', 'actually', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'clever', 'bits', 'was', 'something', 'seeing', 'actual', 'Snoopy', 'opposed', 'adult', 'white', 'turtle', 'neck', 'made', 'parts', 'bit', 'more', 'effective', 'including', 'Woodstock', 'particularly', 'song', 'Snoopy', 'was', 'inspired', 'touch']",N/A

While the content is taken from the Broadway musical, the animation and the voices are in keeping with the Peanuts TV specials and movies.  Translation?  They've got little kids and adequate animation.But that's not a huge problem for me because I love what is here.  The emphasis seems to be on the songs with only a little bit of dialogue between them.  But since the musical is a collection of vignettes and not a complete story, that certainly works.And I love some of the songs here.  ""T-E-A-M"" is funny and sad.  ""Book Report,"" which finds the gang attempting to write a report on Peter Rabbit, and ""Glee Club,"" which presents a hilarious but not necessarily harmonious take on ""Home on the Range"" provide the best laughs.With the emphasis being on the songs, many of the other bits get cut or left out.  There is one section that deals with Valentine's Day.  And they've got Charlie Brown's classic monologue about lunch time.  But I do wonder why they left out Snoopy's fight with the Red Barron.Speaking of Snoopy, he does get a voice here.  No, he doesn't talk to the kids, but he does sing his two classics from the show, ""Snoopy"" and ""Suppertime.""The DVD only contains this 48 minute special.  Seems like they could have put something else on here.  The 15 minute documentary on the musical and how it became a special is a little too short and scattered to truly tell us much, but there are a few interesting nuggets in there.Personally, I would love to get a live action version of the show, preferably from after the revival so we can get my favorite song.
