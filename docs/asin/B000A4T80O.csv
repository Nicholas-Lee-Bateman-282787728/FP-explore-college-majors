I decided to invest in a few yoga videos to keep me moving at a good pace and really improve my body's tone and muscle shape.Rodney Yee is a master yogi.

His body is perfectly sculpted and toned, and watching him, I was able to make my body mimic his.At first, the moves were not that difficult, and they did not ""burn"" but as the workout continued, my body began to really feel the positions and open up. At some point, I even began yelling back at Rodney, ""I've got it this time!"" I felt so proud that I was able to easily follow along through most of it, and when I couldn't get it right the first repition, the move was repeated for both sides 3 times until I had it down!This is great for intermediate yogis, even beginners who have a knowledge of the positions!

The poses are all done slowly and with continuous movement then repeated several times. The sheer slowness trains the mind to be `present' so you will definitely feel the burn.YOGA BURN is different then Rodney Yee's other practices and I really enjoyed this workout as I found myself getting into the zone because of its slow, meditative and almost hypnotic quality (the great ambient music helped too) Some of the poses are quite advanced but I think the really challenging part is the length of time the poses are held and the repetition (most sequences are done 2 to 3 times each.)For a change this has been filmed indoors and Rodney looks better than ever as he gives us flawless voice instruction from a raised wooden platform. The audio is available with 2 different options; Full or minimal instruction (which is a great feature)I think complete beginners will need more instruction and modifications than are available here and I did find some of the moves quite advanced.

921091,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B000A4T80O,Colleen M. Schneider,"[2, 2]","In Yoga Burn Rodney Yee takes standard yoga poses and slows them down to a fluid and graceful flow. Each move is done three times and then flows into the next position.  Now don't get me wrong, slow and precise does not mean easy; when you are slowing down repetitions where your core (abs) are engaged you are building some mighty strong muscles, and you do feel it.  This dvd was excellent.  I felt like the poses were well chosen for the workout: chair poses, forward bends, bridge, triangle, seated twists, boat pose, bow pose among other others.  I felt very loose and relaxed when I finished this dvd and felt like I had a good practice.  My mind felt calm and my muscles felt loose and well worked.I do yoga a couple times a week along with many types of exercises and would consider myself an intermediate practitioner.  Though the dvd states beginner to advanced, I would recommend watching the dvd all the way through if you are an absolute beginner and don't feel like you have to go as deeply into the poses if you are not quite there with your flexibility.  I started with very elementary dvds for practice at home first so that I had practiced quite a bit before moving on.  I would say this would be perfect for intermediate and above as you are already familiar with the poses and already know how to flow from one pose to the next.The instruction is calming with light instrumental music in the background that is pleasant and never distracting.I enjoy yoga by Bryan Kest, Alan Finger, Sara Ivanhoe and Shiva Rea among others and liked the idea of getting something a little different with my practice.  I felt much like I do when I practice Pilates-I felt that due to the slow and precise movement I worked my body very efficiently.An excellent addition to your home yoga practice!",5,a slow flow that challenges the core....,1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,1799,"['Yoga', 'Burn', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'standard', 'yoga', 'poses', 'down', 'fluid', 'graceful', 'flow', 'move', 'done', 'three', 'times', 'then', 'next', 'position', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'slow', 'precise', 'not', 'mean', 'easy', 'when', 'are', 'slowing', 'down', 'repetitions', 'where', 'core', 'abs', 'are', 'engaged', 'are', 'building', 'mighty', 'strong', 'muscles', 'do', 'feel', 'dvd', 'was', 'excellent', 'felt', 'poses', 'were', 'well', 'chosen', 'workout', 'chair', 'poses', 'forward', 'bridge', 'triangle', 'seated', 'twists', 'boat', 'pose', 'bow', 'pose', 'other', 'others', 'felt', 'very', 'loose', 'relaxed', 'when', 'finished', 'dvd', 'felt', 'had', 'good', 'practice', 'mind', 'felt', 'calm', 'muscles', 'felt', 'loose', 'well', 'worked.I', 'do', 'yoga', 'couple', 'week', 'many', 'types', 'exercises', 'would', 'consider', 'intermediate', 'practitioner', 'dvd', 'beginner', 'advanced', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'dvd', 'way', 'are', 'absolute', 'beginner', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'have', 'go', 'deeply', 'poses', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'flexibility', 'started', 'very', 'elementary', 'dvds', 'practice', 'home', 'first', 'had', 'practiced', 'quite', 'bit', 'moving', 'would', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'intermediate', 'above', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'poses', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'flow', 'one', 'pose', 'next.The', 'instruction', 'calming', 'light', 'instrumental', 'music', 'background', 'pleasant', 'never', 'distracting.I', 'enjoy', 'yoga', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'Alan', 'Finger', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'others', 'liked', 'idea', 'getting', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'practice', 'felt', 'much', 'do', 'when', 'practice', 'Pilates-I', 'felt', 'due', 'slow', 'precise', 'movement', 'worked', 'body', 'very', 'efficiently.An', 'excellent', 'addition', 'home', 'yoga', 'practice']",Rodney Yee: Yoga Burn

If you are looking for something like Bryan Kest or Baron Baptiste where you hold the pose for at least five breadths, this is not it.  However, the repetition of slow movements (3xs each) allows for bringing circulation into that area of the body, and you find you are able to get a little deeper each time.  I love watching him as I'm doing the yoga.  It feels like Rodney is just flowing with the movements-a very intuitive practice.  This was a nice spin on the usual vinyasa where sometimes you flow in and out of poses too quickly.  Sometimes a position feels so good you just want to stay there and ""feel the sweetness of it""--if that is what you are looking for this is the video for you.

921096,A55LS2HWPQB0Q,B000A4T80O,"Jill Florio ""Green RVer""","[5, 5]","I picked up this DVD at Target for 15 bucks and I really like it. All my other Yoga DVDs feature women as instructors, and I was nervous that a man instructor would focus too much on strength moves. I don't know how that applies to Rodney's other DVDs, but in this one he only does easy beginner poses.The key is, he does each pose in a set of three. You do the moves slowly, which took me awhile to actually DO, as I am used to each pose at the speed I have been already doing them.I did not feel much of a 'burn', but i did feel a definite heat in my core during the hour-long workout. I honestly felt GREAT - my blood was nice and warm and I felt very strong. So maybe this is the kind of burn that is referred to, instead of the typical aerobics burn of using a muscle group until fatigue. This DVD is not like that at all, even though it's what I was expecting.Some of his sequences were very fluid and creative - I liked his warrior vinyasa, for example. And some of his forward bends really encouraged my body to loosen to a far greater extent than I had done previously. I found the repetition of each pose (the three times) to be boring at first. Then I noted that each time I repeated the pose I was able to go significantly further into the stretch.I did not find that much strength was needed in the hour, but then, I like downdogs and planks. There are also some updogs halfway through that got exhilarating/tiring, but one can always replace them with cobras if needed.Rodney has a very nice yoga instructional voice. Soothing. He does not talk too much - the instruction is just enough, as long as you know what each pose is named (he uses the English terms). Rodney is also enjoyable to look at.The setting is quite nice - set in a yoga studio - some kind of very cool Zen one. There are rice screens behind him; he is on a bamboo floor platform, and the platform is set above a Zen rock garden. The beige sand is raked around the rocks like one would expect. Very peaceful to look at, with some Zen-like, low music in the background that does not distract.I found the DVD a bit sparse in options. No matrix or sections to choose from - you just start the program and an hour later you are done. So if you don't have that much time, you'd have to do only a part of this DVD from the beginning, or fast forward to another section and go from there.There is an intro by Rodney that i still need to watch. There is a choice of playing the hour with less instruction - ie, just voice prompts. The full-on instructional option is not for novices, however. Rodney assumes you have some experience and can follow along by going into downdog, boat, warrior one and two, etc, without having to be told anything about them. He provides no postural tips or even breathing assistance. I think at one point he reminds us to breathe and relax our faces, and that's all we get. I would have liked more direction about when to breathe in and out, myself.So this DVD would be good for experienced beginners and for intermediates looking for an easy burn. Anyone expecting any arm balances, pigeons or wheel poses won't find them here. I assume for that we'd have to buy his Intermediate Yoga DVD.

What I found is that Rodney starts to loose the mind/body/breath connection.  I have gone to yoga classes with much better thought out moves.  Sometimes he moves so fast in and out of asanas that I loose my inner focus.The routine feels rushed. It also feels WESTERNIZED.  Like Rodney is trying get on the LA Burn power craze... which is NOT YOGA!!!  That is just my opinion.  I rarely use this video after buying it... as again I just feel rushed. There are many other Rodney Yee videos I prefer.Also my belief is one does not have to pump the body hard or stand on your head in a neck stand to get benefits from yoga.  Yes head/neck stands etc. might be applicable to some.. but this routine seems to move from beginning to advanced postures.. In otherwords it feels like the routine is all over the place.Sorry not my fav.J.

As someone who's been doing yoga for about one year, I find this a good workout: not too intense and not too easy.  Just right (for me).Other reviewers say the moves are VERY slow, but I don't think they are.  In total contrast to the other reviewers, I wish it was even slower.  But this is how I like to do yoga.  I feel I should stress that: this is how I like to do yoga.The reason I wrote that sentence twice is because I think reviews of ""workouts"" are HIGHLY subjective.

921106,A2P4C0R66Z3ZAZ,B000A4T80O,Pix76,"[19, 20]","I was reading through the many reviews of this DVD and realized that I've actually owned Yoga Burn for about 2 years and never used it! I think what happened was I bought Yoga Burn at the same time I bought Yee's Advanced Yoga DVDRodney Yee - Advanced Yoga.  It took me all of 2 minutes of previewing the Advanced DVD to stop it and put it away.  I put the Burn DVD on the shelf with it, assuming that it would be equally difficult; they'd been collecting dust together ever since!But reading the other reviews recently made me realize that I can probably do the Burn DVD, so I pulled it out and tried it (the Advanced Yoga DVD is still collecting dust, and will probably be for many years to come). Now that I've tried the Burn DVD, I understand what the debate is about, and I think I can help bring some clarity for those who are wondering if they should purchase it.1. For those who are afraid it will be too difficult: this DVD CAN be done by beginner-level folks!! The entire DVD is comprised of basic poses. The difficulty only comes from having to hold them for a longer period of time. As you practice, you will gain strength, flexibility, and the agility you will need for transitioning from pose to pose. If it's too difficult at first, just do as much as you can and you will eventually do the whole thing with purpose, integrity, and grace.2. For those who are afraid it will be too easy: ok, I may not be the MOST fit person in the world.  But I'm fit enough to do Rodney Yee'sPower Yoga - Total Body Workoutor Shiva Rea's Fire Practice without collapsing! If this DVD is practiced with purpose and you INTENTIONALLY use the muscles that the poses are designed to target, you will not be able to help but feel a burn.  Now, exactly how MUCH burn will depend on your fitness level, but there's no way you won't generate some heat.3. For those who are afraid there won't be enough instruction: Yee explains during the introduction that the main focus of this DVD is in the slow, purposeful TRANSITIONING from one pose to the next.  I take this to mean that people who purchase this video (even beginner-level folks) should already be somewhat familiar with basic poses as well as with how to breathe.If you are not familiar with basic poses and breathing, then you should also purchase Yoga for Beginners (Patricia Walden's DVD is an exceptional source of basic instructionYoga for Beginners,Yoga Journal - Yoga Practice for Flexibility).  But don't let that stop you from purchasing Yoga Burn.  Once you're confident with the poses and breathing, you can pop in the Burn video when you're in the mood for a good, extremely low-impact workout that will improve your strength, flexibility, and mindfulness.4. For the folks who are afraid it will be boring: I'm not a big Dr. Phil fan these days, but I agree with him when he says that ""bored people are usually BORING people.""  If you're getting too used to ANY video that you practice, just make a choice to spice it up!  Creative folks who are very familiar with a DVD and its poses will naturally begin to alter the poses to make them more advanced or more interesting.Of course, I can't speak for anyone else, but I myself did not find this one boring.

Rodney may be too Eastern or new age for some but if his calling the floor ""mother earth"" bothers you then you probably will not like this routine anyway. If I recall I think Camel might be the only pose that beginner might have trouble with other than fact that you are on your hands a lot holding poses so wrist issues might be something for beginners too.  As for intermediate  or advanced yogis, the beauty of yoga is you never out grow it and instead just go deeper in the pose and the long hold counts work beautifully for deepening into the moves for greater gains in flexibility. Folks if you are not feeling the burn IT IS YOU NOT MR.

Plus, I am cursed with the tightest hamstrings in the Western hemisphere.  And so it was with some trepidation that I popped in Rodney Yee's ""Yoga Burn"" DVD - something about the title jangled a bit.Fortunately, this hour-long workout DVD is flat-out solid.  Like all the Rodney Yee productions, the workout is polished and precise.  Yee narrates his workout in voice-over while he silently goes through the poses.  The stage has an attractive temple quality, and while there is some music in the soundtrack it never rises above the level of mild background noise.  And Yee never gets new-agey or overly-spiritual like other yogis.The workout is flat-out tremendous.  Yee puts you through a full-body workout that focuses on repetition and control.  Prepare to move slowly from pose to pose - this slow pace is more pronounced early, but it is a recurring theme throughout the video.  By focusing on holding positions and controlling movement, ""Yoga Burn"" earns its name.The workout starts out slowly with some lower-body stretches (staff pose, cobbler's pose, etc.), gradually moves to some strengthening positions (lots of downward dog transitioning to leg lifts, baby cobras, lunges, etc.), moves to some extensive hamstring and lower-back work, and finishes with some bridge poses and general cool-down.  Yee keeps things moving, and while you repeat most poses three times, he has a couple of one-off poses that prevent monotony from setting in over the course of the hour.All in all, this is an excellent foundation yoga workout for your week.

921111,A2W4W1P1S0547T,B000A4T80O,sobepeace,"[175, 175]","This is a beautiful, mindful, and potentially powerful yoga practice. It is true that there are no big surprise poses in this sequence--all are well-known, fairly basic level poses. The main audio option contains some instruction, but mostly about moving into and out of the poses; there is not much about alignment within the pose. Complete beginners may need more instruction and modifications than available here. The other audio option omits instruction at all, containing only prompts for moving from one pose to another.  The basic poses, simple instruction, and deemphasis on speed makes this dvd a good place for advanced beginners who have some knowledge of the poses to deepen their understanding of them, and for anyone, irrespective of level, to work on the mindful awareness aspect of their yoga practice.The intensity in this dvd comes, not from speed or difficulty of poses, but from deep, slow, conscious repetition of fundamental asanas, with the time to build awareness of movement into, within, and out of them. Yoga is not meant to be a purely physical activity. The awareness aspect of yoga is rightfully considered advanced practice, and the familiar poses presented here allow the mind to take precedence. The point is not merely physical endurance (though, if done right, this sequence will also challenge the body in that way). The purpose is at least twofold: physically, to develop long and lean muscle through slow repetition of simple postures, and mentally, to use the simplicity of the poses as a platform for developing presence and awareness with each pose. Yoga is, after all, about the mind-body connection, and this practice aims at allowing the time and space for working on this crucial element. For those ready to move their yoga practice beyond the physical dimension while still developing the body, this is a lovely practice dvd.The asanas are presented in small cycles of three poses or so with about three repetitions each, so it is hard to present an exact sequence, but here is a list of poses, roughly as they appear in the practice: Staff, Flying Crossed Legged Pose, Cobbler, Half Boat, Boat, Simple Crossed Leg Twist, Cat, Down Dog, Plank, Cobra, Single-legged Down Dog, Triangle, Warrior 2, Standing Forward Bend, Chair, Standing Side Stretch, Warrior 1 and 2, Low Lunge with backbend, Low lunge with hands in reverse prayer, Bow, Cobbler with forward bend, Head to Knee forward bend, Wide Angle forward bend series, Seated Forward Bend, Back Stretch, Reclined Bent Knee Twist, Bridge, Reclined Leg Stretch, Reclined Crossed Leg to Chest, Corpse.",5,burning awareness,1156118400,"08 21, 2006",2006,2597,"['beautiful', 'mindful', 'potentially', 'powerful', 'yoga', 'practice', 'true', 'are', 'big', 'surprise', 'sequence', 'are', 'well-known', 'fairly', 'basic', 'level', 'poses', 'main', 'audio', 'option', 'instruction', 'mostly', 'moving', 'poses', 'not', 'much', 'alignment', 'pose', 'Complete', 'beginners', 'may', 'need', 'more', 'instruction', 'modifications', 'available', 'here', 'other', 'audio', 'option', 'instruction', 'containing', 'only', 'prompts', 'moving', 'one', 'pose', 'basic', 'poses', 'simple', 'instruction', 'deemphasis', 'speed', 'good', 'place', 'advanced', 'beginners', 'who', 'have', 'knowledge', 'poses', 'deepen', 'understanding', 'anyone', 'irrespective', 'level', 'work', 'mindful', 'awareness', 'aspect', 'yoga', 'practice.The', 'intensity', 'dvd', 'not', 'speed', 'difficulty', 'poses', 'deep', 'slow', 'conscious', 'repetition', 'fundamental', 'asanas', 'time', 'build', 'awareness', 'movement', 'Yoga', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'purely', 'physical', 'activity', 'awareness', 'aspect', 'yoga', 'rightfully', 'considered', 'advanced', 'practice', 'familiar', 'poses', 'presented', 'here', 'allow', 'mind', 'take', 'precedence', 'point', 'not', 'merely', 'physical', 'endurance', 'done', 'right', 'sequence', 'will', 'also', 'challenge', 'body', 'way', 'purpose', 'least', 'twofold', 'physically', 'develop', 'long', 'lean', 'muscle', 'slow', 'repetition', 'simple', 'postures', 'mentally', 'use', 'simplicity', 'poses', 'platform', 'developing', 'presence', 'awareness', 'pose', 'Yoga', 'mind-body', 'connection', 'practice', 'allowing', 'time', 'space', 'working', 'crucial', 'element', 'ready', 'move', 'yoga', 'practice', 'physical', 'dimension', 'still', 'developing', 'body', 'lovely', 'practice', 'dvd.The', 'asanas', 'are', 'presented', 'small', 'cycles', 'three', 'poses', 'so', 'three', 'repetitions', 'hard', 'present', 'exact', 'sequence', 'here', 'list', 'poses', 'roughly', 'appear', 'practice', 'Staff', 'Flying', 'Crossed', 'Legged', 'Pose', 'Cobbler', 'Half', 'Boat', 'Boat', 'Simple', 'Crossed', 'Leg', 'Twist', 'Cat', 'Down', 'Dog', 'Plank', 'Cobra', 'Single-legged', 'Down', 'Dog', 'Triangle', 'Warrior', '2', 'Standing', 'Forward', 'Bend', 'Chair', 'Standing', 'Side', 'Stretch', 'Warrior', '1', '2', 'Low', 'Lunge', 'backbend', 'Low', 'lunge', 'hands', 'reverse', 'prayer', 'Bow', 'Cobbler', 'forward', 'bend', 'Head', 'Knee', 'forward', 'bend', 'Wide', 'Angle', 'forward', 'bend', 'series', 'Seated', 'Forward', 'Bend', 'Back', 'Stretch', 'Reclined', 'Bent', 'Knee', 'Twist', 'Bridge', 'Reclined', 'Leg', 'Stretch', 'Reclined', 'Crossed', 'Leg', 'Chest', 'Corpse']",Rodney Yee: Yoga Burn

921113,A1T6VABQU7RBMA,B000A4T80O,T. Carr,"[4, 4]","This is a wonderful yoga dvd for all levels. I think it is difficult to find a yoga dvd that would work for everyone, but this may be it. It doesn't focus on the spiritual/cleansing side of yoga (e.g. no talk of letting go of negative energy or connecting to your inner self, chanting etc.) nor does it focus on only the physical benefits. Whether you look to yoga as a healing practice for the mind and soul or strictly as way to keep flexible and fit, this practice would appeal to you, as it allows for a natural, meditative calmness while providing some deep stretches.The poses are fairly basic, though he does not offer detailed instruction on correct form. Therefore, if you're completely, completely new to yoga you may want to start elsewhere. However, I think so long as you have some understanding of body positioning and breath this dvd could work for you. Even though the poses are fairly basic, they offer a good stretch, and are not SO basic that they are boring for the advanced practitioner. I have done many, many yoga dvds that were too basic to hold my interest or to feel worthwhile, and this is not one of them.Rodney Yee's instruction is very clear. Usually when I'm doing an exercise dvd for the first time I have to constantly look up to the screen to see what's going on. Very shortly into the exercise I found myself following along to his cuing and barely needing to look at the screen at all. This also made it easier to get into the yoga flow and make the process more relaxing and meditative.My one, tiny gripe is that there's a small part where the video shot does not match with what is being said. It lasts about 5 seconds and then the image on the screen matches what he is doing again. His instruction moves on to a new exercise while the image repeats the previous movement. The video image moves back to what he is talking about while the new move is still being set up so it doesn't disrupt much. And after you realize this once you just end up ignoring it when you do the exercise again. Still, it's unfortunate to have this happen in a dvd that otherwise is superb.(As a side note, I got this as part of a Rodney Yee Power Yoga Collection which includes this plus 2 additional 60 min. yoga workouts of Rodney Yee's on one dvd (Power Yoga Total Body and Yoga Conditioning for Athletes). It costs only a dollar or two more than any of the workout dvds individually and they're all fantastic workouts. GREAT value!)",4,Wonderful yoga practice.

921115,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B000A4T80O,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[4, 4]","Sobepeace 8/21/06 wrote a great review & the poses he names are all Rodney does. There aren't a lot of poses in this 50 min practice w/a 4 minute relaxation mediation due to the fact he moves slow in/out & during each pose & there is repetition for every pose. He moves about 1/4-1/2 speed the whole time & each pose is done 2-4x each either again & again or in a sequence. Normally I hate repetition, but with Rodney's good energy/awareness, I was able to do it, I would also do a more advance version of what he was doing or else instead of in/out as he does, I would hold the pose the whole time. At first I started to FFW, because I was anxious to do something else besides workout before it got too late, but with Rodney, I didn't want to. The music is very slow/minimal which I usually don't like, but it fits with the slow pace & once I got my racing mind to relax with the repetitive down dog, single leg down dog, knee to nose, then w/addition of a lunge repetition & then warrior series, that tired me out a bit. The only thing I'd wish is that instead of doing any poses more then 2x, he'd add more poses. I do enjoy the pace, but I think it would have been better served with that. Since I have good body awareness, I was able to do my own stretches or additions sometimes when he did repetitions that I felt compelled to do that moment, which I'm sure he would be glad that people would do. I have to admit, I felt intense soreness for two days after doing this. Rodey's body awareness really inspires you to push yourself as well & you're never bored.The production quality from GAIAM is great as usual, Rodney voice overs as always, you can choose the minimal instruction w/pose name or choose him only saying the pose names alone. Considering that lack of detailed instruction, this is not for yoga newbies, but intermediate beginners or advanced beginners & beyond. Those more advanced can use it as a light day or for slower, more forced body conscious practice.There are TWO trailers on youtube under ""Gaiam Yoga Burn"" submitted by GAIMSEARCH which is the same video they use on their site gaiam com",4,Slow moving basic poses for body awareness & strength building,1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,2118,"['Sobepeace', '8/21/06', 'wrote', 'great', 'review', 'poses', 'names', 'are', 'Rodney', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'poses', '50', 'min', 'practice', 'w/a', '4', 'minute', 'relaxation', 'mediation', 'due', 'fact', 'slow', 'in/out', 'pose', 'repetition', 'pose', '1/4-1/2', 'speed', 'whole', 'time', 'pose', 'done', '2-4x', 'again', 'again', 'sequence', 'Normally', 'hate', 'repetition', 'Rodney', 'good', 'energy/awareness', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'would', 'also', 'do', 'more', 'advance', 'version', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'else', 'instead', 'in/out', 'would', 'hold', 'pose', 'whole', 'time', 'first', 'started', 'FFW', 'was', 'anxious', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'workout', 'got', 'too', 'late', 'Rodney', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'music', 'very', 'slow/minimal', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'slow', 'pace', 'once', 'got', 'racing', 'mind', 'relax', 'repetitive', 'down', 'dog', 'single', 'leg', 'down', 'dog', 'knee', 'nose', 'then', 'w/addition', 'lunge', 'repetition', 'then', 'warrior', 'series', 'tired', 'out', 'bit', 'only', 'thing', ""'d"", 'wish', 'instead', 'doing', 'poses', 'more', 'then', '2x', ""'d"", 'add', 'more', 'poses', 'do', 'enjoy', 'pace', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'have', 'good', 'body', 'awareness', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'own', 'stretches', 'additions', 'sometimes', 'when', 'did', 'repetitions', 'felt', 'compelled', 'do', 'moment', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'glad', 'people', 'would', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'felt', 'intense', 'soreness', 'two', 'days', 'doing', 'Rodey', 'body', 'awareness', 'really', 'push', 'as', 'well', ""'re"", 'never', 'bored.The', 'production', 'quality', 'GAIAM', 'great', 'usual', 'Rodney', 'voice', 'overs', 'always', 'can', 'choose', 'minimal', 'instruction', 'w/pose', 'name', 'choose', 'only', 'saying', 'pose', 'names', 'alone', 'Considering', 'lack', 'detailed', 'instruction', 'not', 'yoga', 'newbies', 'intermediate', 'beginners', 'advanced', 'beginners', 'more', 'advanced', 'can', 'use', 'light', 'day', 'slower', 'more', 'forced', 'body', 'conscious', 'practice.There', 'are', 'TWO', 'trailers', 'youtube', 'Gaiam', 'Yoga', 'Burn', 'submitted', 'GAIMSEARCH', 'same', 'video', 'use', 'site', 'gaiam', 'com']",Rodney Yee: Yoga Burn
