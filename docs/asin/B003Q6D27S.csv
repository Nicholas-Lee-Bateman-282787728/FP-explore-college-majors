I've felt this way for the last couple of Saw movies but thought I would give this one a buy for the 3D effect since there are so few 3D movies out. The movie was just OK. I will most likely not watch it again but I am not an uber fan. It has it's twists and the scenarios are original and a throwback at the same time.3D- I would rate the 3D effect at a 3. There were times that it was really neat but they were very few and far in between. It lacked the depth I've seen in other live action 3D films. There were times with the lighting that it completely washed the scenes out and I thought it was completely unacceptable.Bottom Line. If your a Saw fan you probably aren't reading this and you probably already have the movie.

1357365,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B003Q6D27S,A. Estes,"[0, 1]","The long-running ""Saw"" series comes to a conclusion with yet another gruesome installment. ""Saw: The Final Chapter"" (renamed from its theatrical version, ""Saw 3D"") attempts to wrap up any and all loose ends within 90 minutes in an effort to ensure that Jigsaw's legacy will not go on. Unfortunately the film-makers just can't get out of their own way and what the viewer is left with is just another ""Saw"" movie that provides no real closure but rather leaves a few loose ends dangling in the wind. But hey, the traps are pretty cool!To explain the plot(s) would be an insufferable headache. So to keep it simple, the test subject at hand here is a self-help guru (Sean Patrick Flannery) who claims to have survived one of Jigsaw's life-changing traps. Unfortunately for him, somebody is on to his secret and puts him to the test to see if he can truly live up to the story he has built his fame upon. You can almost see Tony Robbins squirming in his seat with each and every gnarly and nasty trap laid out on-screen.If you've seen all six ""Saw"" movies leading up to ""The Final Chapter"" then you pretty much know what to expect. Fact is, the series was played out about four installments ago, but the writers (Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan) have done a remarkable job of pulling plot devices out of thin air and creating new characters for us to despise. Speaking of despicable, beware of the acting in this film, which hits an all-time low. The worst offender of all would be Chad Donella, who plays newbie detective Adam Gibson. Donella obviously studied at the Matthew McConaughey school of acting and serves more as the unintentional comic relief of the show than an actual tangible protagonist.Having knocked the film for its convoluted plot and horrendous acting (Flannery, you're alright), it must be said that ""Saw: The Final Chapter"" at least delivers what the fans expect at this point. There's plenty of gore to go around with the traps themselves being every bit as outlandish and uncomfortable as you'd expect. Long-time fans will get a smile on their face as an old character comes back for one more round, which is appropriate because at this point nobody else but the die-hards are following along. Shamelessly, the film wraps up in an all-too predictable fashion, leaving the door wide open for the inevitable ""Saw VIII: A New Beginning."" Game over? Hardly.",3,Game Over?

IV) how they bring Jigsaw back into the film. And of course they don't fail in that in this one. And each film has that 'gotcha' moment, that 'aha factor'. This one comes at the very beginning of the film as a character not seen since the 1st film makes a return appearance. It seems like everyone else has mentioned who this is, but I won't for those who like to keep secrets. But once this person returns you realize who has really been masterminding things from behind the scenes so to speak. You realize who has been Jigsaw's right hand man this whole time. And it isn't Det. Hoffman. And a lot of people (myself included) would say that pt. VI was a good/great ending to the series, and it was, or would have been. But this one serves as a great end-game as well. All the players are dispatched, or, if not, you know where they stand. And c'mon, the giant roasting pig is a classic.Oh one more thing, for those who bought this just 'cause it's in 3D....what are ya, dumb or something. You bitch about the film b/c the 3D sucks? Lame.

1357371,A3327KH3Z7GZ1F,B003Q6D27S,"Anthony L. Wallace ""ALW""","[2, 4]","Saw 3D was a gut wrenching film from beginning to end. The return of Dr. Gordon was awesome and was not disappointed by his performance. The continuing battle between Detective Hoffman and Jill escalated with Hoffman's identity being released to the IA and on the run. With this escalation brings countless deaths and a man losing his way towards vengeance and trying to eliminate all loose ends. The main character in this film, Bobby Dagen, becomes the next pawn in Jigsaw's Legacy, as he must face a series of traps that he must free all of those he has deceived. By lying to everyone about his experience in a Jigsaw trap, and making money off his book, he will endure pain and suffering along the way towards his ultimate test which shouldn't be any surprise. This film has it's ups and downs, however, it does give a sense of closure as it respects to Dr. Gordon. The traps in this film may not have the same moral dilemma that the past six have all carried with, but everyone must realize that these traps were set forth by Detective Hoffman, a man who has lost his ways, and has thrown everything he was taught by Jigsaw out the window. The main game was set in motion by Hoffman to get his hands on Jill Tuck, and also give way to his escape (or so Hoffman thinks). Saw 3D feels different as a film, but that's what makes it fun and exciting. Though some of the acting was bad and could have left out some humor, but not all, overall the film was enjoyable and had a great sense of closure at the end.

Hivner ""Jack Lantern""","[1, 2]","Saw's Final Chapter does everything it set out to do: It ties up all the loose ends, is done in 3D, is exceptionally gory, brings back characters throughout the earlier films, and ends the long-running story-driven plot. The problem is, most of these weren't accomplished in the best ways they could've been.When a long-running horror franchise ends, it's nice to see everything fit together and make sense by the conclusion, which The Final Chapter achieves. But somehow, even though the film debuted within the timeframe of all the others, it feels rushed and insignificant. Perhaps this is due to what was to be Saw's biggest twist of all. It was not only suspected by most Saw die-hards, but the filmakers chose to introduce this colossal twist within the movie's first 10 minutes, ruining the effect. From that point on, it's a dead giveaway.This isn't to say The Final Chapter doesn't have its moments. The acting is as good as it's always been for returning characters, so if you liked/disliked them before, nothing changes here. There are a few twists and turns along the way, which for better or worse, is entertaining to watch. Unfortunately, Tobin Bell(Jigsaw)'s screen time is significantly reduced. He appears in only a scant few scenes, and the perfomances are very brief. This makes the rest of the film's shortcomings all the more conspicuous.The gore is top-notch, and is done magnificently throughout; perhaps better than ever before. The 3D effects are good as well, but let it be known you don't see a whole lot of it. Horror fans will likely find My Bloody Valentine 3D to be far more satisfying in the 3D department. The overall look is similar to what you'd come to expect from a Saw film, though there is a very interesting trap setpiece done in public while in broad daylight. It's new for the series, and is a very welcome addition.Saw: The Final Chapter is an interesting film, and ties up the numerous loose ends from the earlier installments, making the annual horror series come full circle. Most die-hards will enjoy it, as it accomplishes all it's primary objectives. It's just that it seems if that was the filmakers' only goal, and to do it as quickly as possible. The Final Chapter manages to come together, but something's missing.

Detective Hoffman survives the trap set by Jill Tuck at the end of the last film, and initiates the largest game yet in order to lure an ex-partner into delivering Jill into his possession. Hoffman chooses a con-artist that has been posing a Jigsaw survivor to place in the center of his cruel new devices, but who will survive, and how will it all end? Rather than tying up the loose ends that were set up in the six previous entries, SAW 3D goes back even further in the series and re-opens closed story threads in order to further complicate the plot. If the terms convoluted, contrived, and utterly preposterous ever applied, it would be in this seventh installment. Sadly, these new twists add nothing to John Kramer's original designs. There is hope for the film yet, despite the disappointing storyline! As ridiculous and implausible as the elaborate traps may be, they even bloodier and more sadistic than ever before, with the most gore the series has ever seen.

It does add up to some fairly awesome, sinister fun. Not much to really hack or slash this particular one away from the rest of the bloody pointless franchise, aside from the visual 3-D gimmicks. Don't be expecting some deep, revealing closure to give the entire story some greater meaning or purpose. But it does have a higher budget (17 million) and delivers plenty of blood and repulsive human carnage. Anything less would just be barbaric.You will see some familiar faces here, but the main new character is Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flanery). He achieved quasi-celebrity status by falsely claiming to have survived one of Jigsaw's traps. Bad idea to mock a homicidal lunatic, as Bob's lies will soon become a reality.In case you somehow don't know what's in store here, there is plenty of hacksaws ripping flesh, buzzsaws chopping off limbs, and circular saws viscerating all hope from sapless victims. There are some other deadly traps where survival is just not looking too promising. It's some good gooey pleasure for you morbid gorehounds, lots of graphic entrails removal and unpleasant disembowelment to make you wince in delight. You timid viewers should definitely avoid this deranged adventure, of course.As far as the 3D goes, it does look kinda cool I suppose but it doesn't add much to the overall experience. In fact, it detracts from the realism quite a bit.So overall it's more of the same here. This final Saw delivers exactly what you should expect.

1357388,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B003Q6D27S,C. Sawin,"[7, 10]","None of the Saw films have been able to capture the same atmosphere or effectiveness of the original film. The sequels weren't able to screw with your head or have a twist that was quite as big as the one in the 2004 film. Most of the sequels had a budget of around $10 million, but went on to gross over $50 million at the box office. It's no wonder that Jigsaw is the new face of horror and the Saw films are being called the modern version of Friday the 13th since the sequels hit every year around Halloween like clockwork. So now, here we are, the ""final"" installment in the franchise and it's being presented in 3-D. Unfortunately, Saw 3D leaves a lot to be desired.The film honestly felt like it was just trap after trap after trap until we reached the finale. The traps were bigger and sure, they looked pretty great in 3-D, but they were happening to new characters; characters we didn't know or care about. It seemed like they tried to cram as many traps they could into an hour and a half to capitalize on the 3-D trend. On one hand, that isn't all bad. If you're a fan of the series, you'll probably still enjoy the countless amount of traps (seriously, you won't be able to remember all of them after it ends). If the film was just another Saw sequel, these bigger traps and new characters would be fine. But this is labeled as the last film of the franchise and other than what's revealed in the final minutes of the film, nothing is answered or unanswered that wasn't revealed in Saw VI.The script seemed pretty horrid at times. Coincidentally, both examples are from the Detective Gibson character. So maybe just his dialogue was written terribly. At one point, Gibson calls Jill, ""crazier than a sack full of cats."" Who says that? Even a crazy person who witnessed someone putting a bunch of cats in a bag would think that was lame. Later on in the film when Gibson is talking to Jill, he literally says the word, ""crazy,"" about every other word. This isn't the exact dialogue, but it went something like, ""I knew you were crazy the moment I set my eyes on you, you crazy woman. You're crazy. Crazy. I knew you were crazy."" So hey, did you hear? Gibson thinks Jill is crazy. It was just very redundant, but many would use that word to describe the Saw films anyway.The biggest issue of the whole film is the lack of John Kramer. He literally has like two flashback scenes and an intro video. That's it. Sure, the man died four films ago and he's been surviving on flashbacks and memories ever since, but Tobin Bell doesn't deserve top billing if he's only in the film for five minutes. The highlights of the film mostly lie in the short amount of screen time Dr. Gordon gets. Cary Elwes' return to Saw was probably the biggest drawing point of the film. The problem is that when you bring a character back from a previous film, especially in the Saw films, you can probably guess what that person was brought back for. So the predictability was a bit of a letdown.The ending itself actually made it feel like Saw 3D was a return to form or at least an attempt to get back to its roots, which sounds pretty good on paper but isn't once you see it on-screen. Unless Saw 8 actually winds up happening and continues on with mostly new characters, then the whole thing feels like nothing more than a huge tease.Saw 3D is not a satisfying conclusion to a horror franchise that has run the past seven years as it leaves too many unanswered questions to gratify hardcore fans, but is still fairly entertaining thanks to its endless amount of traps and return of Dr. Gordon. The film does seem to wrap up everything for the John Kramer character, but makes you wonder if the series is really done or if it was left open ended on purpose in case it does well at the box office for the seventh year in a row. At the end of the day, Saw 3D may be considered a pointless sequel that will either leave fans wanting a more definitive conclusion or wishing it never happened.",3,"Trap heavy, but a weak conclusion to a seven year franchise",1288396800,"10 30, 2010",2010,3976,"['None', 'Saw', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'capture', 'same', 'atmosphere', 'effectiveness', 'original', 'film', 'sequels', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'screw', 'head', 'have', 'twist', 'was', 'quite', 'as', 'big', 'one', '2004', 'film', 'Most', 'sequels', 'had', 'budget', '10', 'million', 'went', 'gross', '50', 'million', 'box', 'office', 'wonder', 'Jigsaw', 'new', 'face', 'horror', 'Saw', 'films', 'are', 'being', 'called', 'modern', 'version', 'Friday', '13th', 'sequels', 'hit', 'year', 'around', 'Halloween', 'clockwork', 'So', 'now', 'here', 'are', 'final', 'installment', 'franchise', 'being', 'presented', '3-D', 'Unfortunately', 'Saw', '3D', 'lot', 'be', 'desired.The', 'film', 'honestly', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'trap', 'trap', 'trap', 'reached', 'finale', 'traps', 'were', 'bigger', 'sure', 'looked', 'pretty', 'great', '3-D', 'were', 'happening', 'new', 'characters', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'care', 'seemed', 'tried', 'cram', 'many', 'traps', 'could', 'hour', 'half', 'capitalize', '3-D', 'trend', 'one', 'hand', ""n't"", 'bad', ""'re"", 'fan', 'series', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'still', 'enjoy', 'countless', 'amount', 'traps', 'seriously', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'remember', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'Saw', 'sequel', 'bigger', 'traps', 'new', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'labeled', 'last', 'film', 'franchise', 'other', 'what', 'revealed', 'final', 'minutes', 'film', 'nothing', 'answered', 'unanswered', 'was', ""n't"", 'revealed', 'Saw', 'VI.The', 'script', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'horrid', 'times', 'Coincidentally', 'examples', 'are', 'Detective', 'Gibson', 'character', 'maybe', 'just', 'dialogue', 'was', 'written', 'terribly', 'one', 'point', 'Gibson', 'Jill', 'crazier', 'sack', 'full', 'cats', 'Who', 'Even', 'crazy', 'person', 'who', 'witnessed', 'someone', 'putting', 'bunch', 'cats', 'bag', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'lame', 'Later', 'film', 'when', 'Gibson', 'talking', 'Jill', 'literally', 'word', 'crazy', 'other', 'word', ""n't"", 'exact', 'dialogue', 'went', 'something', 'knew', 'were', 'crazy', 'moment', 'set', 'eyes', 'crazy', 'woman', ""'re"", 'crazy', 'Crazy', 'knew', 'were', 'crazy', 'hey', 'did', 'hear', 'Gibson', 'Jill', 'crazy', 'was', 'just', 'very', 'redundant', 'many', 'would', 'use', 'word', 'describe', 'Saw', 'films', 'anyway.The', 'biggest', 'issue', 'whole', 'film', 'lack', 'John', 'Kramer', 'literally', 'two', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'intro', 'video', 'Sure', 'man', 'died', 'four', 'films', 'ago', 'been', 'surviving', 'flashbacks', 'memories', 'ever', 'Tobin', 'Bell', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'top', 'billing', 'only', 'film', 'five', 'minutes', 'highlights', 'film', 'mostly', 'short', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'Dr.', 'Gordon', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'return', 'Saw', 'was', 'probably', 'biggest', 'drawing', 'point', 'film', 'problem', 'when', 'bring', 'character', 'back', 'previous', 'film', 'especially', 'Saw', 'films', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'what', 'person', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'predictability', 'was', 'bit', 'letdown.The', 'ending', 'actually', 'made', 'feel', 'Saw', '3D', 'was', 'return', 'form', 'least', 'attempt', 'get', 'back', 'roots', 'pretty', 'good', 'paper', ""n't"", 'once', 'see', 'on-screen', 'Unless', 'Saw', '8', 'actually', 'up', 'happening', 'mostly', 'new', 'characters', 'then', 'whole', 'thing', 'feels', 'nothing', 'more', 'huge', 'tease.Saw', '3D', 'not', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'horror', 'franchise', 'run', 'past', 'seven', 'years', 'too', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'gratify', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'still', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'thanks', 'endless', 'amount', 'traps', 'return', 'Dr.', 'Gordon', 'film', 'seem', 'wrap', 'up', 'everything', 'John', 'Kramer', 'character', 'wonder', 'series', 'really', 'done', 'was', 'left', 'open', 'ended', 'purpose', 'case', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'seventh', 'year', 'row', 'end', 'day', 'Saw', '3D', 'may', 'be', 'considered', 'pointless', 'sequel', 'will', 'either', 'leave', 'fans', 'wanting', 'more', 'definitive', 'conclusion', 'wishing', 'never', 'happened']",Saw: The Final Chapter

Robinson ""Electrojunkie""","[0, 2]","I'm a big fan of the first three Saw films but they could have really stopped at the third one, because of the rest of the franchise heavily relied on flashbacks so that Tobin Bell could be a part of all the films. So for four films straight we have to get the backstory of Jigsaw and tie up any loose ends from the six previous films. If they knew they were going to use Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith for these films, then should have kept them alive and not kill them off so early.Saw VII was bad, not the worst in the franchise but very bad nonetheless and opens up the possibility of an 8th film if they so decide to do so. That's why End is in quotation marks in my title. The first trap in the film made no sense as they aren't connected to anything or anyone in this film and these traps are mostly done in private areas and never explained why this one is made public for everyone to see who was walking by that day. The trap just didn't make sense. The first trap is basically for the added gore. Then they have this meeting of something of all the Jigsaw survivors and this one lady who talks about her trap, but we never seen her trap in previous films, that trap was there to be added.Also this film made horrible mistakes in killing off all the main characters by the fourth film and we're getting all these new characters like we're suppose to care for them knowing they are going to die anyway. They killed off important characters like Det. Kerry who was the lead detective early on, so she should have made it all the way to the last film.This one we have Sean Patrick Flanery playing some author, who lied about being a part of Jigsaw's games now him along with his entourage and wife have to suffer because of it. Meanwhile Jill is trying to keep herself from being caught by Hoffman as the results from Saw VI. This plot and sub plot is very weak because in the previous films the subjects that Jigsaw chose were being tested. SPF's character was just being tested for being a liar.It just seemed to me that Betsy Russell and Costas Mandylor wasn't too thrilled on doing this film because they gave very wooden performances as well as Chad Donnella as he was stiff in his scenes as they were the leading actors in this movie. S. Patrick Flanery must have had some botox injected in his face because his facial expressions didn't change at all. Cary Elwes comes back but in total he's in the film for a whole 7 minutes, as he appears sporadically in the film and he couldn't do much to save it. If the leading actors aren't giving good performances then we can only fear what the supporting actors are bringing to the table which isn't much as they are assigned to be obnoxious characters and their main objectives is to just cuss and scream, so we could care less if they got their guts ripped out. Of course the Saw franchise will never be recognized for it's acting abilities which is why no big name actors were apart of it except for Danny Glover in the 1st film but his movie roles recently have been questionable.They could have done better to end the franchise then what they put out. Just because you had Saw films come out every year doesn't mean rush through the last one. To date Saw III was the highest grossing film for the Saw franchise and it should have told the writers and whatnot after the rest didn't rack up as much mone , that they should have concentrated and really thought out the last film. Should have written it in a way that would have made viewers wanting more but can't, now it's don't want anymore sequels.",1,"Very Bland Movie to ""End"" the series",1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,3557,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'first', 'three', 'Saw', 'films', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'stopped', 'third', 'one', 'rest', 'franchise', 'heavily', 'relied', 'flashbacks', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'could', 'be', 'part', 'films', 'So', 'four', 'films', 'straight', 'have', 'get', 'backstory', 'Jigsaw', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'six', 'previous', 'films', 'knew', 'were', 'going', 'use', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'Shawnee', 'Smith', 'films', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'alive', 'not', 'kill', 'off', 'so', 'early.Saw', 'VII', 'was', 'bad', 'not', 'worst', 'franchise', 'very', 'bad', 'nonetheless', 'up', 'possibility', '8th', 'film', 'so', 'decide', 'do', 'so', 'why', 'End', 'quotation', 'marks', 'title', 'first', 'trap', 'film', 'made', 'sense', 'are', ""n't"", 'connected', 'anything', 'anyone', 'film', 'traps', 'are', 'mostly', 'done', 'private', 'areas', 'never', 'explained', 'why', 'one', 'made', 'public', 'everyone', 'see', 'who', 'was', 'walking', 'day', 'trap', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'first', 'trap', 'basically', 'added', 'gore', 'Then', 'have', 'meeting', 'something', 'Jigsaw', 'survivors', 'one', 'lady', 'who', 'trap', 'never', 'seen', 'trap', 'previous', 'films', 'trap', 'was', 'be', 'added.Also', 'film', 'made', 'horrible', 'mistakes', 'killing', 'off', 'main', 'characters', 'fourth', 'film', ""'re"", 'getting', 'new', 'characters', ""'re"", 'suppose', 'care', 'knowing', 'are', 'going', 'die', 'anyway', 'killed', 'off', 'important', 'characters', 'Det', 'Kerry', 'who', 'was', 'lead', 'detective', 'early', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'way', 'last', 'film.This', 'one', 'have', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'playing', 'author', 'who', 'lied', 'being', 'part', 'Jigsaw', 'games', 'now', 'along', 'entourage', 'wife', 'have', 'suffer', 'Meanwhile', 'Jill', 'trying', 'keep', 'being', 'caught', 'Hoffman', 'results', 'Saw', 'VI', 'plot', 'sub', 'plot', 'very', 'weak', 'previous', 'films', 'subjects', 'Jigsaw', 'chose', 'were', 'being', 'tested', 'SPF', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'being', 'tested', 'being', 'liar.It', 'just', 'seemed', 'Betsy', 'Russell', 'Costas', 'Mandylor', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'thrilled', 'doing', 'film', 'gave', 'very', 'wooden', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'Chad', 'Donnella', 'was', 'stiff', 'scenes', 'were', 'leading', 'actors', 'movie', 'S.', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'botox', 'injected', 'face', 'facial', 'expressions', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'back', 'total', 'film', 'whole', '7', 'minutes', 'sporadically', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'save', 'leading', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'giving', 'good', 'performances', 'then', 'can', 'only', 'fear', 'what', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'bringing', 'table', ""n't"", 'much', 'are', 'assigned', 'be', 'obnoxious', 'characters', 'main', 'objectives', 'just', 'cuss', 'scream', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'got', 'guts', 'ripped', 'out', 'course', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'recognized', 'acting', 'abilities', 'why', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'were', 'apart', 'Danny', 'Glover', '1st', 'film', 'movie', 'roles', 'recently', 'have', 'been', 'questionable.They', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'end', 'franchise', 'then', 'what', 'put', 'out', 'Just', 'had', 'Saw', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'year', ""n't"", 'mean', 'rush', 'last', 'one', 'date', 'Saw', 'III', 'was', 'highest', 'grossing', 'film', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'should', 'have', 'told', 'writers', 'whatnot', 'rest', 'did', ""n't"", 'rack', 'up', 'as', 'much', 'mone', 'should', 'have', 'concentrated', 'really', 'thought', 'out', 'last', 'film', 'Should', 'have', 'written', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'viewers', 'wanting', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'anymore', 'sequels']",Saw: The Final Chapter

And being the seventh entry, it's only natural that this Saw is in need of a good sharpening.I've seen every film in this series, and this one falls somewhere in the middle as far as plot, quality, and creativity go. The movie is being advertised as the final Saw, and I hope that's true. I have always been intrigued by the overall premise - which isn't just to slice and dice innocent victims like so much of the ""torture porn"" does nowadays. These movies take moral and ethical dilemmas, and turn them into inventive life or death games. This seventh film lost a lot of the originality and the traps seemed quite repetitive, while many of the deaths were not justifiable in the realm of the Saw logic. Here the filmmakers just decided to splatter as much blood on their 3D audience for sheer shock value - and that is not something I am a fan of.I will say, without spoiling the ending, that the last five minutes were extremely satisfying. If you're a Saw fan, you should see this movie if for nothing more than seeing how the saga concludes. If you've never seen one of these films and are curious, rent the first one.

The body being decapitated looked so fake compared to even the first two films which had the lowest budget to work with. I'm not sure if the director was trying to do something unique or different because it sure was disappointing to end the SAW Series like this.

1357394,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B003Q6D27S,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[0, 1]","After surviving the RBT that Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell) so elegantly placed on his head at the end of ""SAW 6"", and with an entire police force now after him, Jigsaw's protegee Detective Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor), who has the uncanny ability of healing from an electric shock and facial mutilations rather quickly, decides to even out the score. He wants Jill dead but she has gone to the police and in exchange for information, seeks police protection. Meanwhile a dishonest Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flanery), a proclaimed Jigsaw trap survivor who is capitalizing on his experience, is put through a series of gruesome tests. If you've seen any of the previous films, you know the traps are set to a timer and if not completed in time, the unfortunate victim will meet an unpleasant demise. More of the same? Yes. But considering this is the final film in the franchise, I was expecting a lot more.In regards to the gore, the film delivers the goods. Yes, the gore and grisly deaths are here in abundance so gore-hounds will not be bored and the squimish will most likely be sick to their stomachs.  The film also boasts in having the most traps of any SAW film. I originally saw this film in the theatres in 3-D and felt the 3-D effects were under utilized. Watching it on the small screen I wondered why they even bothered filming this in 3-D at all and many have already complained about the fake looking blood which looked good on the big screen, on DVD ... not so much.Now, as mentioned previously, since this is supposed to close out the series, I was expecting a lot and my expectations were firmly set high. What I got was an all too familiar premise and some very unfortunate character developments thanks to the not so clever writers. My biggest beef with this sequel is with the treatment of 2 key characters: Jill Tuck and Detective Mark Hoffman.I had grown fondly attached to the character of Jill. Her character in previous films, SAW 6 being the exception, did not get much screen time but from the few seconds you saw of her you knew that she was somehow involved in Jigsaw's warped game. Her wicked smile, her cool and detached demeaner gave her an air of arrogance and yet she remained an enigma. There was a self confidence to her that convinced me that if there was anyone capable of outsmarting Hoffman, it would be her. There was an opportunity here to fully flesh out her character but instead the writers decided to turn on her and transform her from a slick, detached babe who oozed mystery and quiet malice to a whimpering idiot and a damsel in distress. Prior to this film, there was a build-up to her character but the writers decided to use her as a prop and went the other direction. Detective Hoffman, on the other hand, reaches his final transformation here into HE-MAN.. or ""The Terminator"" .. or maybe 007? His character became a caricature of ludicrous proportions, a Rambo-esque powerkiller who is able to annihilate the world using his mad skills and a knife. Really?Judging by the reaction from those I saw this with and by public reviews, ""SAW 3-D"" or ""The Final Chapter"" is definitely receiving a mixed reaction. I most definitely hated it and purchased it simply for completing my SAW DVD collection but in my heart of hearts... my true final chapter is ""SAW 6"". This installment is disappointing on many levels. Instead of giving us a satisfying conclusion, the writers got a little lazy and gave us a more of the same by-the-numbers sequel. It was predictable, the dialogue was cheesy and the final twist was something that was predicted years ago. Watch it for the never-ending gore and the elaborate traps but don't expect much else. Game Over? I should hope so...unless they find a clever way of resurrecting the series and finally give us a proper closure.",2,Delivers the Gore but an Incredibly Disappointing Finish to the Franchise.,1296691200,"02 3, 2011",2011,3808,"['surviving', 'RBT', 'Jill', 'Tuck', 'Betsy', 'Russell', 'so', 'elegantly', 'placed', 'head', 'end', 'SAW', '6', 'entire', 'police', 'force', 'now', 'Jigsaw', 'protegee', 'Detective', 'Mark', 'Hoffman', 'Costas', 'Mandylor', 'who', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'healing', 'electric', 'shock', 'facial', 'mutilations', 'rather', 'quickly', 'even', 'out', 'score', 'Jill', 'dead', 'gone', 'police', 'exchange', 'information', 'police', 'protection', 'Meanwhile', 'dishonest', 'Bobby', 'Dagen', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'proclaimed', 'Jigsaw', 'trap', 'survivor', 'who', 'capitalizing', 'experience', 'put', 'series', 'gruesome', 'tests', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'previous', 'films', 'know', 'traps', 'are', 'set', 'timer', 'not', 'completed', 'time', 'unfortunate', 'victim', 'will', 'meet', 'unpleasant', 'demise', 'More', 'same', 'Yes', 'considering', 'final', 'film', 'franchise', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'more.In', 'regards', 'gore', 'film', 'goods', 'Yes', 'gore', 'grisly', 'deaths', 'are', 'here', 'abundance', 'so', 'gore-hounds', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'bored', 'squimish', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'sick', 'stomachs', 'film', 'also', 'having', 'most', 'traps', 'SAW', 'film', 'originally', 'saw', 'film', 'theatres', '3-D', 'felt', '3-D', 'effects', 'were', 'utilized', 'Watching', 'small', 'screen', 'wondered', 'why', 'even', 'bothered', 'filming', '3-D', 'many', 'have', 'already', 'complained', 'fake', 'looking', 'blood', 'looked', 'good', 'big', 'screen', 'DVD', 'not', 'so', 'much.Now', 'mentioned', 'previously', 'supposed', 'close', 'out', 'series', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'expectations', 'were', 'firmly', 'set', 'high', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'too', 'familiar', 'premise', 'very', 'unfortunate', 'character', 'developments', 'thanks', 'not', 'so', 'clever', 'writers', 'biggest', 'beef', 'sequel', 'treatment', '2', 'key', 'characters', 'Jill', 'Tuck', 'Detective', 'Mark', 'Hoffman.I', 'had', 'grown', 'fondly', 'attached', 'character', 'Jill', 'character', 'previous', 'films', 'SAW', '6', 'being', 'exception', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'few', 'seconds', 'saw', 'knew', 'was', 'somehow', 'involved', 'Jigsaw', 'warped', 'game', 'wicked', 'smile', 'cool', 'detached', 'demeaner', 'gave', 'air', 'arrogance', 'yet', 'remained', 'enigma', 'was', 'self', 'confidence', 'convinced', 'was', 'anyone', 'capable', 'outsmarting', 'Hoffman', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'opportunity', 'here', 'fully', 'flesh', 'out', 'character', 'instead', 'writers', 'decided', 'turn', 'transform', 'slick', 'detached', 'babe', 'who', 'oozed', 'mystery', 'quiet', 'malice', 'whimpering', 'idiot', 'damsel', 'distress', 'Prior', 'film', 'was', 'build-up', 'character', 'writers', 'decided', 'use', 'prop', 'went', 'other', 'direction', 'Detective', 'Hoffman', 'other', 'hand', 'final', 'transformation', 'here', 'HE-MAN..', 'Terminator', '..', 'maybe', '007', 'character', 'became', 'caricature', 'ludicrous', 'proportions', 'Rambo-esque', 'powerkiller', 'who', 'able', 'annihilate', 'world', 'using', 'mad', 'skills', 'knife', 'Really', 'Judging', 'reaction', 'saw', 'public', 'reviews', 'SAW', '3-D', 'Final', 'Chapter', 'definitely', 'receiving', 'mixed', 'reaction', 'most', 'definitely', 'hated', 'purchased', 'simply', 'completing', 'SAW', 'DVD', 'collection', 'heart', 'hearts', 'true', 'final', 'chapter', 'SAW', '6', 'installment', 'disappointing', 'many', 'levels', 'Instead', 'giving', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'writers', 'got', 'little', 'lazy', 'gave', 'more', 'same', 'by-the-numbers', 'sequel', 'was', 'predictable', 'dialogue', 'was', 'cheesy', 'final', 'twist', 'was', 'something', 'was', 'predicted', 'years', 'ago', 'Watch', 'never-ending', 'gore', 'elaborate', 'traps', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'else', 'Game', 'should', 'hope', 'so', 'find', 'clever', 'way', 'resurrecting', 'series', 'finally', 'give', 'proper', 'closure']",Saw: The Final Chapter

Instead of dedicating it's over-edited and slight running time (90 minutes, with a fade-out at the 85-minute mark) to wrapping-up all of the plot strings left hanging from previous movies this seventh film instead shoehorns in YET ANOTHER bunch of hopeless morons who cannot stop and use common sense for just two moments to get themselves out of series of grisly traps. It falls very far below the social commentary of Saw VI and it all feels like arbitrary filler.With Hoffman now on the rampage and after Jill a new detective on the case (about the 40 millionth cop featured in the series) shelters her from his wrath while another game plays out in an abandoned asylum. Why on Earth Hoffman would still honor Jigsaw's wishes after he marked him for death at the end of the previous movie is obviously not something you're supposed to think about.Liar Bobby Dagen is the schlub who has to fight his way through the latest traps as punishment for telling porkies about being a Jigsaw survivor. The cassettes say that Bobby has been publicizing these lies for &#34;years&#34;, which does not fit in with the chronology.This plot was completely unnecessary. There's no twist at the end either, all Saw 3D does is confirm what everybody had been suspecting since the end of the first movie - Doctor Gordon IS alive (and apparently still practicing medicine) and is in cahoots with Jigsaw. So...did he return to his family or not? Why is he considered &#34;disappeared&#34; in the other movies? Looking for answers? You're not going to find them here. Jigsaw's narration also claims that Gordon has been helping him for &#34;years&#34;. But since this movie takes place a couple of months after VI, which happened immediately after V, which took place right after IV, which took place simultaneously as III, which took place a few months after II that revelation could only make sense if Saw II took place years after Saw, which is obviously not true.Kevin Gruetert, who seems to direct the movie like a kid waiting for the final school bell to ring, has ZERO idea of how to utilize the 3D gimmick. Hanging? Wooden planks? A string down the throat? Really? Really??? Jason Voorhees had a far superior 3D adventure 28 years before this movie. It's Saw VII, not Saw 3D.The series had a few interesting moments and good ideas, but this one just makes you glad that it's finally over.The 1.78:1 1080p picture looks like any other Saw movie in 2D, with horrible filters, fake tampering to bring faces out of darkness, giving them a purple hue instead anything fleshy and normal, and lots of pink blood.

The reason Saw appealed to me, and the reason I watched it all the way through to the ""end"" is because of the psychological aspect. This review will be for the series as a whole, as each individual movie does not deserve 5 stars. The quality fluctuated among the movies and this last one was probably not the best.The first Saw was probably the best one (although that is usually the case when a movie goes on and on for ten years). I was absolutely fascinated at Jigsaw's idea of teaching his ""victims"" a lesson. He was going about it the wrong way, of course, by torturing them, but it was still fascinating. And even if the first was the highest quality, the fifth was my personal favorite. Jigsaw and the movie attacking the insurance industry was just so amazing.Here were my problems:1. You simply cannot orchestrate killing so many people after you are dead. No one is that good at planning ahead. That right there is the best reason for not having so many sequels.2. Jigsaw's victims are so grateful for the lessons they learned that they turn around and help him in his quest to ""teach others lessons."" That is, gruesome murder. That is believable ONCE. How many times did it happen by movie 7? Four?3. How does Jigsaw have all these huge, empty warehouses that he can fill will all these huge traps that the police do not know about? Is he a billionaire or what?4. The traps would never work that perfectly like clockwork the way that they do. Just the fact that the TV screens always pop on with Jigsaw's message the exact second the victim wakes up is highly unlikely. (If you watch the special features, they sometimes had trouble getting the traps to work for filming... and that's with all the people right there WITH the traps! And multiple people who built them!)Anyway, suspend your disbelief (for a ridiculous number of things), watch it for the psychological aspect, and you have an enjoyable movie franchise. I don't generally like horror, so I don't own too many horror movies, but I would probably rate this as my all-time favorite horror series. It lasted too long... they probably should have quit while they were ahead. But they still did a pretty good job, as all 7 movies kept my attention and all 7 movies went together well and connected the pieces that were missing from previous movies. That's another thing you don't often see: sometimes sequels ignore what you have previously learned, but these movies went together so perfectly, it was scary.The final problem was that this ""Final Chapter"" was not so final. There were still a few loose ends. Will there be an eighth chapter? Even though I have enjoyed the series, I don't really hope so... unless it actually wraps it up for good. It has to end sometime, before it wears out its welcome. Which it sort of already did. It's just that those of us who are die-hard fans need to see how it ends that we kept watching this long.",5,"Great, but too many sequels",1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,2963,"['am', 'not', 'horror', 'fan', 'hate', 'blood', 'guts', 'gore', 'reason', 'Saw', 'appealed', 'reason', 'watched', 'way', 'end', 'psychological', 'aspect', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'series', 'whole', 'individual', 'movie', 'not', 'deserve', '5', 'stars', 'quality', 'fluctuated', 'movies', 'last', 'one', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'best.The', 'first', 'Saw', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'one', 'usually', 'case', 'when', 'movie', 'ten', 'years', 'was', 'absolutely', 'fascinated', 'Jigsaw', 'idea', 'teaching', 'victims', 'lesson', 'was', 'going', 'wrong', 'way', 'course', 'torturing', 'was', 'still', 'fascinating', 'even', 'first', 'was', 'highest', 'quality', 'fifth', 'was', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Jigsaw', 'movie', 'attacking', 'insurance', 'industry', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'amazing.Here', 'were', 'problems:1', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'orchestrate', 'killing', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'dead', 'one', 'good', 'planning', 'ahead', 'right', 'best', 'reason', 'not', 'having', 'so', 'many', 'sequels.2', 'Jigsaw', 'victims', 'are', 'so', 'grateful', 'lessons', 'learned', 'turn', 'around', 'help', 'quest', 'teach', 'others', 'lessons', 'gruesome', 'murder', 'believable', 'ONCE', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'did', 'happen', 'movie', '7', 'Four', '3', 'How', 'Jigsaw', 'have', 'huge', 'empty', 'warehouses', 'can', 'fill', 'will', 'all', 'huge', 'traps', 'police', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'billionaire', 'what', '4', 'traps', 'would', 'never', 'work', 'perfectly', 'clockwork', 'way', 'do', 'Just', 'fact', 'TV', 'screens', 'always', 'pop', 'Jigsaw', 'message', 'exact', 'second', 'victim', 'up', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'watch', 'special', 'features', 'sometimes', 'had', 'trouble', 'getting', 'traps', 'work', 'filming', 'people', 'right', 'WITH', 'traps', 'multiple', 'people', 'who', 'built', 'Anyway', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'ridiculous', 'number', 'things', 'watch', 'psychological', 'aspect', 'have', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'franchise', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'like', 'horror', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'too', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'would', 'probably', 'rate', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'horror', 'series', 'lasted', 'too', 'long', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'quit', 'were', 'ahead', 'still', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', '7', 'movies', 'kept', 'attention', '7', 'movies', 'went', 'together', 'well', 'connected', 'pieces', 'were', 'missing', 'previous', 'movies', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'sometimes', 'sequels', 'ignore', 'what', 'have', 'previously', 'learned', 'movies', 'went', 'together', 'so', 'perfectly', 'was', 'scary.The', 'final', 'problem', 'was', 'Final', 'Chapter', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'final', 'were', 'still', 'few', 'loose', 'ends', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'eighth', 'chapter', 'Even', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'hope', 'so', 'actually', 'up', 'good', 'end', 'sometime', 'out', 'welcome', 'sort', 'already', 'did', 'just', 'who', 'are', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'need', 'see', 'how', 'kept', 'watching', 'long']",Saw: The Final Chapter
1357407,A377RCSSGQ6WZW,B003Q6D27S,"ja6438 ""ja6438""","[0, 1]","I have had a checkered opinion on this series for awhile.  When I first viewed SAW back in '05, I was thrilled and decided it was my favorite original horror film of the decade... at least for a little while.  When SAW II and III came along, the vision was destroyed for me, and I sort of resented the series as nothing more than a tacky money maker milking the first movie for everything it was worth.  And then something happened.  The series kept going, and people kept going to see it.  As more and more of Jigsaw's history was unearthed, I found the series to be getting cheesier and cheesier, but also more interesting.Let's get one thing straight, SAW 3D (or SAW: THE FINAL CHAPTER, as they are lamely yet necessarily calling it for home video purposes) is a tried and true popcorn movie; nothing more, nothing less.  While I can't say that I've made it to the movie theater for every one of these movies, I can comfortably say that they're much more enjoyable in a theater environment, whether it be an actual cinema or around the TV with a bunch of friends.  For me, there's little satisfaction to be had sitting in a room cringing, gagging and laughing all by myself, but it's a lot of fun with another person present.  At first I was resenting sequels to the first SAW because I felt that they lowered it from it's pedestal into the pit of B-movies, but I have to give the series credit for going as far as it did.  How many film franchises can boast hitting their first seven entries in their first seven years?  Not even Godzilla or James Bond can say that much, as many of their movies were given a few years to breathe in between productions.Getting back to SAW 3D specifically, this is not a scary movie.  Don't expect much as far as plot or haunting ideas that stay with you for days like some films are capable of producing.  What you CAN expect is some haunting VISUALS that might stay with you for days, and some serious creativity in that department.  With the absence of Jigsaw himself as a major character, we're left with nothing but cardboard cutouts who we actually want to see die, and we are given just that; in that sense, the movie is a terrific success.  There's no sense in delving into plothole peeves; they're there, but that's not why we're watching this movie.  SAW 3D, and the SAW series as a whole (with the exception of maybe the first one) is not where we turn for extensive plot and character development, it is where we turn to see the work of some really talented special effects artists giving it all they've got, and I have to applaud the effort.(... And I can't help but once again comment on the title change.  I don't really see any harm in calling the movie 'SAW 3D' for home video market, since that is the actual title card that appears in the film, which I'm glad they didn't change.  But if they HAD to change the name for perfectly logical reasons, I think 'SAW VII' would have done much better than the dreadfully overused 'The Final Chapter'.

She followed the instructions and found Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and then put him in a face trap. Jill made her getaway. Hoffman was able to get out of the trap. Bleeding and in excruciating pain, Hoffman screams out.What a cliff-hanger!  We eagerly awaited SAW 7 titled ""SAW 3D: The Final Chapter"" for 2010.Since SAW VI (2009) did not do very well, they decided to combine 3 proposed SAW movies into one last movie, thus calling it SAW 3D: The Final Chapter.I prefer to call it ""SAW VII 3D"". Eliminating the ""VII"" or ""7"" from the title is going to confuse people not following the series now, but wish to buy them on DVD and watch them in the correct order.We are taken back to the first SAW (2004), where we see one of the men has cut his foot off to escape. He drags himself down the hallway, stops at a hot, steamy pipe on the wall and deliberately burns the open end of his amputated leg.The game continues as we see Hoffman taking care of his ripped-off facial wounds and stitched himself up.  You know he is going to go after Jill.What has become a tradition in the SAW movie series, is the first trap. This new trap is very differently done than any trap we have seen. The trap is not inside, but outside in a metropolitan city in the business district. It involves 2 men (Jon Cor, Sebastian Pigott) and one woman (Anne Lee Greene). They are trapped in a window shop display case at Metro Hall in Toronto. They are seen by a gathering audience outside as they watch in horror.We are also introduced to another survivor of John's traps. We have not seen him before. Bobby (Sean Patrick Flannery) is making the tv circuit with a published book about his ordeal and he is helping other survivors.That's the beginning of this seventh and last SAW movie and I will not tell you the Grand Finale.Rated ""R"".

Lionsgate has been cranking them out solid every year for October since 2004. They need a break.  The SAW movie franchise is a ""cash cow"" (Mow Mow) for the actors and everyone connected with Lionsgate and the SAW movies.I like the good mystery, suspense, gore, plot twists and the traps they invent. I thought SAW II (2005) was the best and SAW III made it even better. Bringing back Donnie Wahlberg for SAW IV was a great idea and allowing Costas Mandylor to continue his role as ""Hoffman"" since SAW III has keep the drama going. The continuous scene between John and Hoffman in SAW V (without breaking it up) was the best tension-builder of all the films. Certainly nothing wrong with long dramatic scenes between main characters.My first experience seeing a reaL D))3D movie with the new glasses. NO longer red & blue with the new movie techniques.

Im a HUGE fan of ""Behind the scenes"" & ""The Making of"" and ""Behind the traps"" which ALL of the previous Saw films had, all 6. This one had NONE, granted I did enjoy the Deleted scenes on this and I like that it has 2 commentaries but they totally dropped the ball on the behind the scenes stuff.Now for the movie itself. IM A HUGE fan of the Saw franchise. That being said, I think this was rushed. The writing, and I can tell. This is ""supposedly"" the final chapter, but theres so many lose ends and so many unnecessary things. I enjoyed the splatters and all the traps very much, but idk, it didnt feel right. Maybe it was because Torbin Bell was hardly in it. And this film confirms what I've been saying since I saw part 5, the biggest mistake they made in this Franchise is killing Jigsaw off in the 3rd film, they should've kept him alive in a few more. 6 Was a much better story and film and twist than this movieThat being said I hope theres a part 8, in fact, no I HIGHLY doubt that there wont be a part 8, its like they left so many things open, and so many little things that they didnt normally do...there almost has to be a part 8. And if there is a part 8, mark my word, it'll be out after 2011 which will give the writers more than enough time to come up with a amazing movie, one that is worthy to be their last one. BUT at the same time if there is a part 8, theres a very good chance it wont be the last one, especially if the box office performance is great. Wheather its next year, the next 5 yrs, or (in Screams case) the next 15 years, I know there will be a Saw 8 and it will kick Saw 7's butt.So I give the DVD 3 stars & I give the movie 4 stars.",4,OK Im disapointed with this DVD,1305763200,"05 19, 2011",2011,1738,"['Let', 'talk', 'product', 'talk', 'movie', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'scenes', 'Making', 'traps', 'ALL', 'previous', 'Saw', 'films', 'had', '6', 'one', 'had', 'NONE', 'granted', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'like', '2', 'commentaries', 'totally', 'dropped', 'ball', 'scenes', 'stuff.Now', 'movie', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'was', 'rushed', 'writing', 'can', 'tell', 'supposedly', 'final', 'chapter', 'theres', 'so', 'many', 'lose', 'ends', 'so', 'many', 'unnecessary', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'splatters', 'traps', 'very', 'much', 'idk', 'didnt', 'feel', 'right', 'Maybe', 'was', 'because', 'Torbin', 'Bell', 'was', 'hardly', 'film', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'saying', 'saw', 'part', '5', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'made', 'Franchise', 'killing', 'Jigsaw', '3rd', 'film', 'should', ""'ve"", 'kept', 'alive', 'few', 'more', '6', 'Was', 'much', 'better', 'story', 'film', 'twist', 'movieThat', 'being', 'said', 'hope', 'part', '8', 'fact', 'HIGHLY', 'doubt', 'wont', 'be', 'part', '8', 'left', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'open', 'so', 'many', 'little', 'things', 'didnt', 'normally', 'do', 'there', 'almost', 'be', 'part', '8', 'part', '8', 'mark', 'word', ""'ll"", 'be', 'out', '2011', 'will', 'give', 'writers', 'more', 'enough', 'time', 'come', 'up', 'amazing', 'movie', 'one', 'worthy', 'be', 'last', 'one', 'BUT', 'same', 'time', 'part', '8', 'very', 'good', 'chance', 'be', 'last', 'one', 'especially', 'box', 'office', 'performance', 'great', 'next', 'year', 'next', '5', 'yrs', 'Screams', 'case', 'next', '15', 'years', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'Saw', '8', 'will', 'kick', 'Saw', '7', 'butt.So', 'give', 'DVD', '3', 'stars', 'give', 'movie', '4', 'stars']",Saw: The Final Chapter

What an ignominious, albeit fitting end to a once strong horror series that simply overstayed its welcome with audiences.""Saw: The Final Chapter"" finds Hoffman (Costas Mandylor), having survived his death trap at the hands of Jigsaw's widow, Jill (Betsy Russell), now planning one final game in order to settle the score. Knowing that Hoffman will stop at nothing for revenge, Jill seeks out Detective Matt Gibson (Chad Donella), offering up any and all information she possesses in exchange for protection. Meanwhile, Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flanery), a self-help guru and proclaimed Jigsaw survivor, is out promoting his inspirational tale of survival. However, behind Bobby's harrowing tale lay a dark secret that may cost him everything that he holds dear.Having forced myself to endure through the last few entries in this once original and now stale franchise, I thought that perhaps nothing could bring this series to a close. After all, this blood-soaked saga has survived being critically panned repeatedly, it's own incredibly convoluted and borderline incomprehensible storyline, and ultimately becoming tedious and repetitive.I never expected that horror fans would eventually grow tired of the same old thing, quit forking over their hard-earned money, and force Lionsgate to kick the Jigsaw legacy to the curb? I mean, hardcore horror fans have kept many an undeserving franchise afloat well past their prime. But, I guess even the most ardent horror aficionados have their limits.So, where did this most recent, and reportedly ""final chapter"" go wrong? Well, pretty much in all of the same areas as its torturous brethren. Now, please note my doubt at the ""fact"" that this is going to be the absolute final installment in this franchise. After all, ""Friday the 13th Part 4"" was subtitled ""The Final Chapter"" and yet there were six other sequels that followed in its wake. So, pardon my disbelief, but the word ""final"" holds very little meaning with horror films. But, I digress.As has been the growing trend ever since ""Saw IV"", the story for this last installment is as paper-thin as ever; relying solely on the traps to keep things moving along. The writing duo of Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan once again return to craft what unsurprisingly turns out to be yet another well below sub-par horror flick.Now, how does one create a movie that ranks as being below sub-par, you ask? Well, by sticking to the status quo that this duo had established in their previous outings in the series. A checklist of sorts is as follows: creating characters that an audience can relate to is no longer necessary, plot holes can always be fixed by the next installment via flashbacks (except this film can only fix previous entries, any errors here will presumably be left wide open), and originality is either too hard or takes too long.Now that I've listed out briefly what major issues with the story can be found in this movie, let's look at them a little closer.I mentioned that providing a character that audiences could relate to was apparently deemed no longer necessary by the writers of this movie. In the first few movies we were introduced to characters quickly, but we would come to know who they were and see them grow to an extent over the course of the film. With this installment, and the previous two for that matter, the characters placed in the various traps are complete blank slates to us.The only character we do manage to learn bits and pieces about, mostly through the tapes recorded by Jigsaw and a few flashbacks, is the primary victim Bobby Dagen. The problem is, his character, a self-professed self-help guru, is completely uninteresting, and nothing we learn about him improves that perception. For a main character, either the writers poorly handled the role or the actor, Sean Patrick Flanery (""The Boondock Saints""), went completely in the wrong direction with his lame performance. Whatever the case, the character was a narcissistic bore that you find yourself caring very little about.Another issue is the various flashbacks that take place in this movie. The previous films all featured flashbacks to help fill gaps in the story they are featured in, or fix any plot holes left behind by their predecessors. So, if flashbacks have become such a staple of the franchise, then why do they bother me in this installment more than ever before? The reason is because the flashbacks are used so prevalently that they become distracting.Every time I saw a flashback in this film, I just found myself thinking, ""Ok, here we go, what plot hole, from which film in the series, will we be addressing this time?"" When your viewer begins having this type of thought, then game over. Because it has become quite obvious that you've relied on this tool for far too long and it has grown tedious.While we're on the topic of the tedious nature of this series; we now arrive at the unoriginality inherent in this film. For starters, the characters are nothing more than carbon copies of previously used, forgettable characters from other horror films and franchises. Truth be told, I'm not that surprised by this issue, since lame characters have become another staple for the series lately. Still, a little bit more effort could have been put forth to make some of them seem a little more unique. Oh wait, that would have been too hard, and therefore impossible for this writing duo.Then there are the infamous traps of the ""Saw"" franchise. Despite their macabre nature, the traps have always been both creative and complex in their design. In the previous two films, they have become less inventive, and a creative block had apparently found its way into this aspect of the series. Now, I presumed that the writers would take whatever steps necessary to break down this block, and bring back some ingenuity to the most recognizable part of these films. Apparently, I was wrong in that presumption.Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of traps that present some originality. However, beyond those two or three traps, the remainder simply repeat various aspects of the three original ideas only with some small twist to make them ""new"" or ""different"". Unfortunately for the writers, this lame attempt to fool the audience failed, and I for one was left feeling like I had already seen it all before.Now, I know that last angle of criticism seemed odd (as it has every time before), but for this type of movie some critiques may seem a bit out there. I mean, when inventive traps are the order of the day, one must point out when that inventiveness has lost its footing. Anyway, moving on.In regards to the writers of this film, Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan: what I don't understand is why these two talent-less hacks continued to get the writing job for this series? Especially, when these guys have been so pivotal in this franchise's steady downfall.To me, if you're either Lionsgate or the franchise's producers you'd want to, I don't know, maybe find someone that could wrap up the series on a higher note rather than potentially push it down further. I'm all for giving people another chance, but come on, these guys have had three previous movies to make their story work. Yet, all they've managed to do was make everything more confusing and derivative.Perhaps if a different writer or writers had been brought on board to help out or re-write this mess, then maybe the series wouldn't have devolved into the stagnant, gore and snore-fest that it has become. Then again, ending the series with ""Saw III"" would have been an even better idea, since that was the last time this series actually possessed anything even remotely resembling a plot and character development. But, I digress once again.Despite all of the issues to be found in this final installment, there were two things that ""Saw: The Final Chapter"" sort of did right. First and foremost, the writers managed to finally bring this series to a conclusion. Not necessarily a completely satisfying one, but a conclusion all the same. For that, I say thank you and it's about time.Secondly, the flashbacks manage to provide some answers to questions left lingering ever since ""Saw IV"". Namely, explaining how so many times since Jigsaw was killed in ""Saw III"" these other victims just so happened to coincidentally stumble into his traps as he had planned. As it turns out, Jigsaw had yet another accomplice previously unknown to the audience who had been maneuvering these victims into their proper places to undergo their ""therapy"", so to speak.Of course, this retconning of events didn't provide resolution for all of the instances of happenstance found in this series. But, at least it was a decent effort all the same. That being said, this surprise revelation still felt convoluted and was an obviously desperate attempt on the writers' part to save face for their oversights and/or shortcomings with the previous three films.You may be wondering why I semi-praised the usage of flashbacks after I just complained about them moments before. Well, the reason is that sometimes an element of a movie can be both beneficial and detrimental at the same time. The flashbacks were problematic because of their prevalence in this film, and also for the incredible amount of retconning they did to the series. But at the same time, the retconning proved beneficial at times in attempting cohesion for the franchise as a whole. It's complicated, but oddly enough I think it's fitting given how convoluted this entire franchise has become.Finally, let's take a look at the quality of acting found in ""Saw: The Final Chapter"". In the lead role of Hoffman, Jigsaw's replacement, we find the insufferably boring and seemingly lifeless (performance-wise), Costas Mandylor. As he has done ever since his first appearance in this series back in ""Saw IV"", Costas has presented to us a performance so completely devoid of any shred of humanity, charisma, or excitement that one wonders how this man ever finds work in Hollywood. Not to mention, why did the casting director feel he was an appropriate choice to replace Tobin Bell after Jigsaw's demise? The answer is beyond me.Speaking of Tobin Bell, as always his brief appearances in this film are the only times I actually became interested in the movie. I was actually surprised that he wasn't featured more in this film. I thought the writers were setting a trend with the previous movies by having Jigsaw appear more frequently through flashbacks than he ever did when he was alive. If that had been the case, then maybe this movie wouldn't have been the worst one yet. I guess they wanted to see if the film could stand more on its own without as much of Tobin's aid. Too bad it didn't pan out, though.Filling out the other primary roles in the film are series veteran Betsy Russell as Jigsaw's widow and series newcomer Chad Donella (""Final Destination"") as a detective tracking down Hoffman.Betsy Russell seemed to fall into Costas Mandylor's method of acting in this film as she does not seem invested in the role at all. Of course, given the low quality of writing found in the script, I can understand why she no longer has any interest in this character. In the case of Chad Donella's performance, I wasn't really sure what to expect. If his one-dimensional, wooden performance in this film is any indication, then I think he fits right in with the rest of the cast. Because he certainly doesn't have the talent necessary for other, much stronger movie fare.Then we have the cameo appearances by Cary Elwes, reprising his role as Dr. Lawrence Gordon from the original film. Cary's performance in the first ""Saw"" was generally over-the-top, and at times laughably so; however, his performance here is almost completely in the other direction. Despite delivering a very restrained performance, Elwes' portrayal wound up suffering from being far too obvious. While he corrected one performance mistake, he created another one in return, go figure.What makes this surprising is that Cary's not new to acting; he's been acting for years. And I know he can do better, I've seen him do it in previous films (for example, ""Kiss the Girls""). I guess he just didn't see a reason to try, most likely due to the quality of the script and how small the role turned out to be.In the end, a once strong horror franchise has been weakened to the point it can no longer sustain an audience's interest and must finally be put down. Of course, if you ever watch this entry, or any of the last few for that matter, then it's not surprising that this is the end given the inferior quality on display. So, unless you're like me, and have watched all of the previous entries in the series and just want to see it come to a conclusion, do yourself a favor and steer clear of ""Saw: The Final Chapter"".""Saw: The Final Chapter"" is rated R for torture, disturbing images, violence and language.",1,The Game is Finally Over...,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,13046,"['six', 'previous',

1357425,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003Q6D27S,Mark Turner,"[0, 2]","3-D has taken the theaters by storm this past year. So much so that everything but the kitchen sink has been tossed at audiences (and I'm not certain that even that hasn't been thrown). Greek Gods to zombies have found there way to the format so is it any wonder that a horror series jumped on board? SAW 3D THE FINAL CHAPTER supplies that need.Fans of the film series have loved every gruesome, gory scene offered. But now they had the chance to witness it in 3D in theaters. But with the movie being released on DVD in regular 2D format is it a good movie? Without the comin' at ya type effects, is it any good? The answer is yes and no.If you've been following the series at all you know that the film began with 2 people chained in a run down old subway type bathroom being provided knowledge of how they had wronged people and given a chance to make a choice, one that would involve some great pain or damage, but that would give them the chance to make write their wrongs.The series continued in this vein with the main character of Jigsaw, the culprit who was behind the dangerous torture fueled traps that held each person captive, who in reality was John Kramer (Tobin Bell). It seems that John was diagnosed with an inoperable condition and then treated poorly by everyone from insurance agents to police. With nothing to lose, he set out to help people change their lives, giving them an opportunity to become valued members of society or perish in the process. Talk about tough love.By the time this film opens, John's last assistant has gone on a rampage and disgraced the original intent that John began with. Sure it was crazy, but Det. Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) has taken it into a whole different direction. As seen in the last film, rather than truly offering people a chance to change, he's set out on making the traps inescapable. Instead of a chance it is now out and out murder.It appeared that he was facing death at the hands of John's wife (Betsy Russell) in the last film, but he escaped and is now searching for her as well as setting up a whole new game for Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flannery). It seems that Dagen claimed to be on of Jigsaw's victims, profiting from writing a book about his experience and going on to creating self help groups for other victims as well as a DVD of their meetings.Now Bobby must face Jigsaw for real in the form of Hoffman. And with each new trap we are witness to another form of torture that has the potential to end gruesomely and with much blood spilled. While not quite out and out torture porn, as this genre has been named, the film does have the viewer bear witness to some truly gut wrenching deaths. Perhaps not if you've seen the other films, but anyone just now jumping on may turn their head more often than once.As Hoffman pursues John's wife and sets in motion Bobby's trial by fire, the police are hot on his trail. Tracking him through the clues left behind, they narrow it down. But will the get there in time to prevent another death forever linked to Jigsaw?One thing the movie does offer is the chance for it to truly end. And the surprise ending here was one that caught me off guard and was actually quite satisfying. But it did offer the slightest chance for the series to continue. One can only hope that the makers of this series let it go out on a high note rather than milk it for one last dollar. I mean does anyone really feel the need to pull out JASON GOES TO MANHATTAN? Six films in a series that has only one (in my opinion) truly bad film is something to take pride in.So if you're a fan you'll love this one. If you've come and gone, you'll get a decent solution to the story. The lose ends are tied up nicely by the last minute. The series has a beginning, middle and an end. And the ending offered is satisfactory.",3,IS IT REALLY THE END?,1295913600,"01 25, 2011",2011,3820,"['3-D', 'taken', 'theaters', 'storm', 'past', 'year', 'So', 'much', 'everything', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'been', 'tossed', 'audiences', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'even', ""n't"", 'been', 'thrown', 'Greek', 'Gods', 'zombies', 'have', 'found', 'way', 'format', 'so', 'wonder', 'horror', 'series', 'jumped', 'board', 'SAW', '3D', 'THE', 'FINAL', 'CHAPTER', 'supplies', 'need.Fans', 'film', 'series', 'have', 'loved', 'gruesome', 'gory', 'scene', 'offered', 'now', 'had', 'chance', 'witness', '3D', 'theaters', 'movie', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'regular', '2D', 'format', 'good', 'movie', 'comin', 'ya', 'type', 'effects', 'good', 'answer', 'yes', 'no.If', ""'ve"", 'been', 'following', 'series', 'know', 'film', 'began', '2', 'people', 'chained', 'run', 'down', 'old', 'subway', 'type', 'bathroom', 'being', 'provided', 'knowledge', 'how', 'had', 'wronged', 'people', 'given', 'chance', 'make', 'choice', 'one', 'would', 'involve', 'great', 'pain', 'damage', 'would', 'give', 'chance', 'make', 'write', 'wrongs.The', 'series', 'continued', 'vein', 'main', 'character', 'Jigsaw', 'culprit', 'who', 'was', 'dangerous', 'torture', 'fueled', 'traps', 'held', 'person', 'captive', 'who', 'reality', 'was', 'John', 'Kramer', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'John', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'inoperable', 'condition', 'then', 'treated', 'poorly', 'everyone', 'insurance', 'agents', 'police', 'nothing', 'lose', 'set', 'out', 'help', 'people', 'change', 'lives', 'giving', 'opportunity', 'become', 'valued', 'members', 'society', 'perish', 'process', 'Talk', 'tough', 'love.By', 'time', 'film', 'John', 'last', 'assistant', 'gone', 'rampage', 'disgraced', 'original', 'intent', 'John', 'began', 'Sure', 'was', 'crazy', 'Det', 'Mark', 'Hoffman', 'Costas', 'Mandylor', 'taken', 'whole', 'different', 'direction', 'seen', 'last', 'film', 'rather', 'truly', 'offering', 'people', 'chance', 'change', 'set', 'out', 'making', 'traps', 'inescapable', 'Instead', 'chance', 'now', 'out', 'murder.It', 'appeared', 'was', 'facing', 'death', 'hands', 'John', 'wife', 'Betsy', 'Russell', 'last', 'film', 'escaped', 'now', 'searching', 'as', 'well', 'setting', 'up', 'whole', 'new', 'game', 'Bobby', 'Dagen', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'Dagen', 'claimed', 'be', 'Jigsaw', 'victims', 'profiting', 'writing', 'book', 'experience', 'going', 'creating', 'help', 'groups', 'other', 'victims', 'as', 'well', 'DVD', 'meetings.Now', 'Bobby', 'must', 'face', 'Jigsaw', 'real', 'form', 'Hoffman', 'new', 'trap', 'are', 'witness', 'form', 'torture', 'potential', 'end', 'gruesomely', 'much', 'blood', 'spilled', 'not', 'quite', 'out', 'torture', 'porn', 'genre', 'been', 'named', 'film', 'have', 'viewer', 'bear', 'witness', 'truly', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'deaths', 'Perhaps', 'not', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'anyone', 'just', 'now', 'jumping', 'may', 'turn', 'head', 'more', 'often', 'once.As', 'Hoffman', 'John', 'wife', 'sets', 'motion', 'Bobby', 'trial', 'fire', 'police', 'are', 'hot', 'trail', 'Tracking', 'clues', 'left', 'behind', 'narrow', 'down', 'will', 'get', 'there', 'time', 'prevent', 'death', 'forever', 'linked', 'Jigsaw', 'One', 'thing', 'movie', 'offer', 'chance', 'truly', 'end', 'surprise', 'ending', 'here', 'was', 'one', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'did', 'offer', 'slightest', 'chance', 'series', 'continue', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'makers', 'series', 'let', 'go', 'out', 'high', 'note', 'rather', 'milk', 'one', 'last', 'dollar', 'mean', 'anyone', 'really', 'feel', 'need', 'pull', 'out', 'JASON', 'GOES', 'TO', 'MANHATTAN', 'Six', 'films', 'series', 'only', 'one', 'opinion', 'truly', 'bad', 'film', 'something', 'take', 'pride', 'in.So', ""'re"", 'fan', ""'ll"", 'love', 'one', ""'ve"", 'come', 'gone', ""'ll"", 'get', 'decent', 'solution', 'story', 'lose', 'ends', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'nicely', 'last', 'minute', 'series', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'ending', 'offered', 'satisfactory']",Saw: The Final Chapter

WATCH THE MOVIE YOURSELF.If you've come this far in the Saw series, the ending will be that much sweeter.Besides, you have a lesson to learn after all you've witnessed at the hands of Jigsaw.Play the game... watch the final Saw. Be amazed at the genius behind the plot that finally comes to a close.You will NOT be sorry.I will miss the yearly Saw movie... the games might be over... but the memory will ALWAYS remain.What a ride it has been. Saw, Saw 2, Saw 3, Saw 4, Saw 5, Saw 6, and Saw The Final Chapter.We've taken quite a ride with the man they call Jigsaw.In the end, the journey was worth it.I have never experienced such a cleaver plot that wrapped all the movies into one package.To understand all, you have to see all... then you will know all.What amazes me through the entire series is that Jigsaw had this ALL planned out from the beginning.He left nothing undone. No stone unturned. No person without their redemption. Everyone played the game.Not everyone won their game. Some lost badly. Others got a healthy dose of reality and learned to appreciate life.Live or die.It was their choice.And chose they did.In the end, Jigsaw himself shed NO blood.He hurt no one.No one died by his hands.They died by their own choices.All Jigsaw did was helped them.In the end, Jigsaw got what he wanted.They'd make a choice.They'd learn a lesson one way, or another.And after 7 movies of this...THE ""BAD GUY"" won... so to speak.But what DID Jigsaw win?He died back in movie 3.What could he possibly have WON from all the games that continued after he was dead?Perhaps it was the satisfaction in knowing even though he was gonna die one way or the other (from his disease or from the hands of someone be it a cop or someone else seeking revenge for the lessons he was teaching them)... all this would one day come to a close and that the lesson would be learned, everyone will have gotten ""educated"" and made their ultimate choices (with their fate being in their own hands), and that even though he wouldn't be there to SEE the ending ... perhaps just KNOWING the genius of it all made John Kramer aka Jigsaw happy/satisfied.In my book, Jigsaw is one of the smartest horror movie ""villains"" of all time. Setting up a game that lasted THAT long... that had EVERYONE he could have possibly thought to need a ""REALITY CHECK"" in it and for it to play out EXACTLY as he predicted down to that final moment... that is what makes the Saw series work on SO many levels.

While you can still get enjoyment out of them as a stand alone, there is nothing better than having seen them all one by one and seeing the parallel between movies, characters, friends and enemies. Bell (Jigsaw) is always at the helm (dead or not) and is the glue for each movie, in this one hes finally on the peripheral as his wife moves up. I believe this is the last (but would not be surprised to see another one) but if its not you need a marathon watch of all them before this one. I liked this premise, and enjoyed seeing familiar faces as trap escapees come together to talk about their ordeals. Every movie gives better and more elaborate traps and this one does not disappoint. I loved the carnage. It seemed more innocents died here, which is kinda sad, even loving carnage I dont just want anyone and everyone to die. Still, for me, Saw never gets old. Hit or miss in the a couple middle movies, but I enjoyed this one too.

The first three movies were the best, but these last two are worthy sequels. I didn't care much for IV or V. The acting this time around is okay and story doesn't lag too much, but I have to say that the traps and gore level is probably the highest of all the films. If only the blood didn't look so cheap, with a noticeable pinkish hue, I think I would have had a harder time not turning away from the carnage.

The best way to approach a ""Saw"" film is to not question anything and just watch it for the torture scenes and gore. Asking where they got 50 old push lawnmowers isnt important. How any of these elaborate devices where built is irrelevant. Sure they've given bogus explainations in past films but, whatever. Jigsaw has become an iconic horror figure thanks to the voice of Tobin Bell and the eerie looking puppet that often delivers the tasks to the many victims through out the series.

With movies like these, the movie industry wonders how come piracy has increased?Reason 1:The overall price to watch movies has increased. I use to be able to watch a movie at the theater for about $3.50-5.50...now with 3D it's like...what? $13-15?? Per person? The DVD of this is sold here for $19~ and the blue ray is $30?!Reason 2:Decline in movie quality. Remakes....remakes of remakes...drawing a movie or tv show out until it is literally boo-ed off and can no longer be milked.Reason 3:Higher availability of high quality pirated material.Saw: The Final Chapter, can be a good example that fits into reason 2. I admit, it's not a horrific sequal/finale (...no more please...) But movies that have 3D in them seem to be using 3D as a clutch, substituting good plot, acting, and general movie quality for cheap effects. The term ""ain't how it use to be"" applies somewhere here. My problem with this final is that it is now literally a movie for people that get a kick for watching other people suffer...and that's it.SPOILER ALERT!!SPOILER ALERT!!After the ""victim""  fails the second time and not being able to save the second person, I already got the impression that this movie has no other objective, but to thrill the viewers with more and more scenes of gore and torture. Usually there's a surviver or so that tags along and makes you feel ""oh okay, maybe they can survive it!"". This movie is too predictable.Let's see.Who here predicted that Sean Flanery aka Bobby (the main victim of the movie) was going to get captured and that he would be the main victim of the movie?Who here predicted that the cops, etc, that entered the 'torture' base where Bobby was being kept were being led into a trap and would die?Who here predicted after the second victim's death that this movie was not really about the possibility of survival, but a gore fest...one after another?Who here predicted that his wife would die in the end?Who here predicted that Jigsaw's wife (ex? forgot...) would die even while under police protection?If you were the ones that were able to predict those, then congrats, you have a brain or you're experience in watching enough movies to tell.If you weren't able to predict all that and still made a review on here...well...Anyway...gore and torture is fine with me (even though that's a sick thought altogether) but I would like a good movie to go along with that.

You've been coming down with something since Saw V though, and I'd know this because I was there, as with many fans, of the Franchise. Actually IV was starting to show signs of wear. And this shows that since Saw 3 struck gold, you thought ""Hey, well, I'm Saw, I can pump out anything since I made a real smash at the B.O."". Well hate to rain on your parade, but, even despite Saw VI being an improvement on this long in the tooth series, it's been feeling like you're not even trying anymore.That isn't to say I hated your latest installment. I saw it tonight in 3D and actually didn't mind it too much. However though, despite entertainment value, I feel as if you spent more time putting effort into 3D as opposed to story. We have Bobby Dagen, a Jigsaw survivor, who is out through a trap again and must save people he knows to save his wife. We have a battle between Hoffman and Jill for Jigsaw's legacy. We have reunions of people who have survived Jigsaw.These storylines are all interesting, I'll admit. But there are lots of holes in them, and there aren't any truly terrifying moments. Sure there are creepy moments, but creepy just isn't enough. What happened to moments like the ""Camera flash"" scene in Saw 1, or the well played and intense scene where Jeff, having just lost his daughter, has to choose between burning her possessions to free the judge who wrongly sentenced the daughter's killer, or letting the judge drown in pig guts and trapping the memory of his daughter?? Sure the scene where Bobby has to help his close friend (whose eyes are covered) walk across loose planks in high areas and set him free is intense, but it doesn't have the same intensity as those two moments mentioned, or the conversation between Jigsaw and Eric in Saw 2 (which was totally brilliant).Overall I am happy that this is the last in your series, because I think its time you and I took some time off from each other. It's been a nice ride and all, but honestly, I think it's time you went to bed for good. While this film wasn't bad, it's definitely good that the series is over. But hey you may come back someday, Saw.

1357446,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003Q6D27S,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[7, 13]","Saw VII (Kevin Gruetert, 2010)I had absolutely no intention of ever letting Saw VII (aka Saw 3D) pass between my eyelids. But my daughter wanted to see it in the theater, and she has an odd relationship with horror movies. She likes them, but prefers to know what's going to happen. Thus, I found myself watching what I knew was going to be one of the worst movies of the year in order to be able to relate the events to the kid so she could watch it. A parent's trials are never done.So here we have what we are being promised is the final chapter of this series, which started off so well and got so bad so fast. As with the rest of the series since the second, half the movie has an incredibly weak plot, in which Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) tries to get to Jill (Betsy Russell). We're no longer even sure why. He can't be erasing his tracks, since basically the entire world's police know he's taken over the jigsaw role. The other half of the movie is all about the elaborate torture traps that various people have to endure. The ""main"" trap involves Bobby Dugan (Sean Patrick Flanery), a self-help guru who wrote a book about surviving a Jigsaw trap. Ah, hubris. He finds himself in another one, with his trophy wife at the end of it. There are a few other traps involved that have nothing to do with anything. Surprised? Not remotely.When James Wan, who devised the storyline for the original, bailed after the first movie, the series kinda fell off a cliff. When Leigh Whannell, who designed the traps for the first movie, also bailed, the series floated down to the bottom of the Marianas Trench. Both have stick around as ""Executive Producers"", which basically means ""we throw money and you and get a cut of the profits."" Why shouldn't they? Everyone with half a brain was well aware that this movie, like all the other entries in the franchise, was going to make money hand over fist. When Wan is in the director's chair, good things get done (viz. the highly underrated Dead Silence from 2007), but Kevin Gruetert, who directed Saw VI, is not nearly James Wan. (IMDB trivia reports that Gruetert was roped into directing this after being signed on for Paranormal Activity 2. I guess there IS a silver lining to this movie, because I can't imagine what a mess he'd have made of that....) Nor have the rest of the franchise's directors, but Gruetert, along with the Melton/Dunstan scriptwriting team who have been responsible for this mess since Saw IV, have taken it to new lows. The more Melton and Dunstan tried to turn it into a soap opera, the more amused I was. This installment is no exception, with a couple of scenes that are supposed to refresh your memory of Saw VI. Except I can't imagine anyone has any memories of Saw VI, unless they watched it just before going to see this. None of the films since II has been in any way memorable. This latest (and hopefully, really, last) in the franchise is no different; those most you'll take away from it is a couple of snatches of interesting, semi-devious trap setups. None of which, I will hasten to add, is nearly as good as the one from the original film.

1357451,A3RTR8Q4POQCKW,B003Q6D27S,SaveUsMike,"[0, 2]","**SPOILER FREE**Words cannot begin to express how dissatisfying SAW 3D was to a avid fan of the entire franchise. From the unlikable characters to the over the top actors who played them. Saw 3D was a HUGE mess. Do not worry about anything being spoiled as all my reviews are spoiler free (Despite knowing almost 1 minute in the movie what to expect). I'll let you find out for yourself.For starters I have always loved the SAW franchise. It has always been my guilty pleasure. While my movie standards are usually set fairly high I have always had a soft spot for SAW (Maybe because each movie had so many intricate plot details and I loved that). My favorite of the series was a tie up between 3 and 4 as I felt things started to really get complex at that point, this wasn't your average Freddy or Jason movie. SAW 5 and 6 were considered mild dissapointments to me but I still loved them nonetheless. I guess I was too anticipating Dr. Gordon making his return that whatever twist the movies had wasn't as good as what I secretly wished it would be. So finally in SAW 3D Dr.Gordon comes back and completely WASTES his return back to the franchise. To be fair it wasn't Carys (Gordon) acting as much as the script he was given that completely was garbage. With lines from ""Main"" Characters such as ""You think im stupid huh, STUPID!"" you will understand why this movie is a complete dud.Apart from the god awful dialog the characters were SO unlikeable! To this day I remember every ""Detectives"" name from a SAW movie, except for SAW 3D. I HATED (I cannot stress that word enough) the ""Main"" character of the movie. Such an unlikable person you practically beg Jigsaw to just kill him already. Absolutely NO redeeming qualities whatsoever and NO he was not written that way he is just a really bad character.My second big complaint was the lack of thought into the traps. I felt that SAW 3 had the best traps that just made you cringe at not only how violent they were but about the symbolism behind the majority of them. In SAW 3D each trap is designed to ""pop out"" at you (the movie was made for 3D audiences but I am sure you all know that) and every trap just involved something sharp pointing at the audience. Hoffman even has a dream at one point about Killing Jill Tuck by having some weird pointy blade thing just fly across the room and stab her. Yes these traps were completely diluted of any thought at all. I would laugh if the directors really thought they were being innovative.BUT my biggest clause is with the return of Gordon and the way his character is so obviously used from the very start of the film. I'll let you see for yourself.To be fair the movie is not completely terrible as a horror movie but lacks the ""heart"" (terrible word I know) that a SAW movie would have. The movie managed to rack in 3 stars from me because 1) it is SAW 2) Gordon did come back, even if I was upset how he was used, and 3) I was entertained by this movie (just not in the way every other SAW movie has entertained me with there complexity.I hope you give the movie a shot though because as a SAW fan it is definitely worth a rental at best.",3,My favorite franchise comes to a painful conclusion,1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,3147,"['**SPOILER', 'FREE**Words', 'can', 'not', 'begin', 'express', 'how', 'dissatisfying', 'SAW', '3D', 'was', 'avid', 'fan', 'entire', 'franchise', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'top', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'Saw', '3D', 'was', 'HUGE', 'mess', 'Do', 'not', 'worry', 'anything', 'being', 'spoiled', 'reviews', 'are', 'spoiler', 'free', 'knowing', 'almost', '1', 'minute', 'movie', 'what', 'expect', ""'ll"", 'let', 'find', 'out', 'yourself.For', 'starters', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'SAW', 'franchise', 'always', 'been', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'movie', 'standards', 'are', 'usually', 'set', 'fairly', 'high', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'soft', 'spot', 'SAW', 'Maybe', 'movie', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'intricate', 'plot', 'details', 'loved', 'favorite', 'series', 'was', 'tie', 'up', '3', '4', 'felt', 'things', 'started', 'really', 'get', 'complex', 'point', 'was', ""n't"", 'average', 'Freddy', 'Jason', 'movie', '5', '6', 'were', 'considered', 'mild', 'dissapointments', 'still', 'loved', 'nonetheless', 'guess', 'was', 'too', 'anticipating', 'Dr.', 'Gordon', 'making', 'return', 'twist', 'movies', 'had', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'what', 'secretly', 'wished', 'would', 'be', 'So', 'finally', 'SAW', '3D', 'Dr.Gordon', 'back', 'completely', 'WASTES', 'return', 'back', 'franchise', 'be', 'fair', 'was', ""n't"", 'Carys', 'Gordon', 'acting', 'as', 'much', 'script', 'was', 'given', 'completely', 'was', 'garbage', 'lines', 'Main', 'Characters', 'such', 'think', 'im', 'stupid', 'huh', 'STUPID', 'will', 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'complete', 'dud.Apart', 'god', 'awful', 'characters', 'were', 'SO', 'unlikeable', 'day', 'remember', 'Detectives', 'name', 'SAW', 'movie', 'SAW', '3D', 'HATED', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'word', 'enough', 'Main', 'character', 'movie', 'unlikable', 'person', 'practically', 'beg', 'Jigsaw', 'just', 'kill', 'already', 'Absolutely', 'NO', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'whatsoever', 'NO', 'was', 'not', 'written', 'way', 'just', 'really', 'bad', 'character.My', 'second', 'big', 'complaint', 'was', 'lack', 'thought', 'traps', 'felt', 'SAW', '3', 'had', 'best', 'traps', 'just', 'made', 'cringe', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'violent', 'were', 'symbolism', 'majority', 'SAW', '3D', 'trap', 'designed', 'pop', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '3D', 'audiences', 'am', 'sure', 'know', 'trap', 'just', 'involved', 'something', 'sharp', 'pointing', 'audience', 'Hoffman', 'even', 'dream', 'one', 'point', 'Killing', 'Jill', 'Tuck', 'having', 'weird', 'pointy', 'blade', 'thing', 'just', 'fly', 'room', 'stab', 'Yes', 'traps', 'were', 'completely', 'diluted', 'thought', 'would', 'laugh', 'directors', 'really', 'thought', 'were', 'being', 'innovative.BUT', 'biggest', 'clause', 'return', 'Gordon', 'way', 'character', 'so', 'obviously', 'used', 'very', 'start', 'film', ""'ll"", 'let', 'see', 'yourself.To', 'be', 'fair', 'movie', 'not', 'completely', 'terrible', 'horror', 'movie', 'heart', 'terrible', 'word', 'know', 'SAW', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'movie', 'managed', 'rack', '3', 'stars', '1', 'SAW', '2', 'Gordon', 'did', 'come', 'back', 'even', 'was', 'upset', 'how', 'was', 'used', '3', 'was', 'entertained', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'way', 'other', 'SAW', 'movie', 'entertained', 'complexity.I', 'hope', 'give', 'movie', 'shot', 'though', 'SAW', 'fan', 'definitely', 'worth', 'rental', 'best']",Saw: The Final Chapter

People simply expressed a disinterest in the ""Saw"" series of films after the sixth. This is nothing new in the horror genre; many other scary films like ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" suffered from the same fate as ""Saw"": overexposure of a great product at the box office.The studio wondered how to bring the audience back for the final installent of ""Saw 7"" and the decision was made to make it in 3D. Also, it was announced heavily in the press that this 3D version would be the finale. Obviously both ideas worked wonderfully as ""Saw 3D"" became the #1 movie at North American cinemas Halloween weekend 2010 raking in an impressive $24,200,000. This made more than $10,000,000 than ""Saw 6"".The story is pretty much the same as other installments in the ""Saw"" series; people are kidnapped by the maniacal Jigsaw and are put into torture chambers to realize how lucky they were with their lives. The propose reason for killing these victims is due to the fact they took their lives for granted. Not for those who have a weakness for gore, ""Saw 3D"" is exciting, involving, well-acted, and a thrill-ride. If you enjoyed the other ""Saw"" films ""Saw 3D"" will satisfy your thirst!Cary Elwes who played a doctor in the original reprises his role in this outing, so his perfromance is a good bookmark for the franchise.",5,"""The Finale, and A Good One""",1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,1488,"['disappointing', 'performance', 'box', 'office', 'Saw', '6', '2009', 'producers', 'wisely', 'decided', 'seventh', 'installment', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'People', 'simply', 'expressed', 'disinterest', 'Saw', 'series', 'films', 'sixth', 'nothing', 'new', 'horror', 'genre', 'many', 'other', 'scary', 'films', 'Halloween', 'Friday', '13th', 'suffered', 'same', 'fate', 'Saw', 'overexposure', 'great', 'product', 'box', 'office.The', 'studio', 'wondered', 'how', 'bring', 'audience', 'back', 'final', 'installent', 'Saw', '7', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'make', '3D', 'Also', 'was', 'announced', 'heavily', 'press', '3D', 'version', 'would', 'be', 'finale', 'Obviously', 'ideas', 'worked', 'wonderfully', 'Saw', '3D', 'became', '1', 'movie', 'North', 'American', 'cinemas', 'Halloween', 'weekend', '2010', 'raking', 'impressive', '24,200,000', 'made', 'more', '10,000,000', 'Saw', '6', '.The', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'other', 'installments', 'Saw', 'series', 'people', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'maniacal', 'Jigsaw', 'are', 'put', 'torture', 'chambers', 'realize', 'how', 'lucky', 'were', 'lives', 'propose', 'reason', 'killing', 'victims', 'due', 'fact', 'took', 'lives', 'granted', 'Not', 'who', 'have', 'weakness', 'gore', 'Saw', '3D', 'exciting', 'involving', 'well-acted', 'thrill-ride', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'Saw', 'Saw', '3D', 'will', 'satisfy', 'thirst', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'who', 'played', 'doctor', 'original', 'role', 'outing', 'perfromance', 'good', 'bookmark', 'franchise']",Saw: The Final Chapter
1357458,A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,B003Q6D27S,The Cool Guy,"[2, 4]","I have watched all the Saw movies. I like them a lot, and this was no exception. I think it is a great Saw movie, and a fitting end to it all. (If indeed the series is truly over - you just know Hollywood is going to resurrect it someday, somehow...)* WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! *** I MEAN IT! MAJOR SPOILERS COMING UP! ***** WHAT, YOU'RE STILL HERE? OKAY, DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YA! ***There were some things I did and didn't like about the movie.DISLIKES:1. I didn't like the ""torture porn"" aspect. Now I realize that this is part of all the Saw movies, but it seemed a lot more obvious here. What I mean is that it seemed like there were a lot of women tortured in this movie, and all of them were really hot. Now, that may be somebody's fetish, but I'm just not into that sort of thing, okay? Torture and murder is part of the Saw movies, but I don't like it when it seems like it's more about the scene than the story. Maybe I'm wrong here, but I don't remember having this reaction from the other 6 Saw movies. Yeah, they all had their ""hot babe being tortured"" moments, but just seems like this one was much worse. (Or better, depending on your view.) And one of the hot babes got killed TWICE, just for good measure.2. I didn't like it that Bobby Dagen failed at the end. Yeah, I know he was a slimeball who got what was coming to him, but toward the end, I kind of empathized with him. I actually wanted him to succeed. Maybe that's not what the writers were going for, but that's what happened with me. I was sad when he fell.3. I also didn't like when the woman Bobby loved got roasted. She didn't actually deserve to die. The others, maybe... But her only crime was being dumb. I mean, come on Jigsaw, what's your problem? Normally, Mr. Jig follows a moral code. I guess in Bobby's case he made an exception. Anyway, that was pretty hard to watch.4. No Amanda. Yeah, I know she's toast at this point. But Jigsaw himself lives on in flashbacks. I would have liked to have seen Shawnee Smith here. But alas, it was not to be (sigh).5. The killing off of Jill Tuck. Was that really necessary? She was a somewhat likeable protagonist. But I guess she was cursed by being a hottie. Yeah, she was an older hottie, but a hottie nonetheless. And that's pretty much a death sentence in any Saw movie. Kind of like those who do drugs or have sex in a Jason movie. If you are female, you don't have to actually do anything bad to die in a Saw movie; you just have to look hot. Oh well, I liked her and was disappointed to see her go. (Also, would she have died instantly like she did at the end? Having a jaw blown off would hurt A LOT, but wouldn't necessarily kill you outright. I shudder to think if it had shown her still squirming there afterward...)6. And speaking of Jill Tuck, did anyone else notice that in the ""suspended above the rails scene"" it looked like she had one super hairy armpit? Maybe it was just the shadowing in the scene, but it sure looked like it. (This is where the pause button on your DVD player comes in handy.) Anyway, Jill and her hairy armpits... Actually, maybe I kinda liked that part.LIKES:1. The return of Dr. Gordon. Yeah, he's a little chubbier. (Hey, it's been over 10 years since the first movie people! It's hard to get exercise when you're an amputee.) But I can go with it. Cary Elwes is a great actor. I always thought Dr. Gordon had died, since I thought I remembered seeing a footless corpse out in the hallway in Saw 2 or 3... but apparently he's alive and well. I liked that. Some people say he was underutilized, but I think he was used just right.2. The appearance of Tobin Bell. Yeah, he only had a couple of parts in the movie, but considering the guy has survived I-don't-know-how-many movies now on nothing but flashbacks, it's still good to see him. And I'm always impressed how they can fit yet another Jigsaw flashback in, and squeeze so much out of it.3. The guy who plays Bobby Dagen is Sean Patrick Flannery, from ""The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"". Now I always thought that show sucked. I don't know if that was Flannery's fault or not (probably not), but it didn't hurt my feelings at all to see bad things happen to Young Indy. If he had worn the hat, I probably would have enjoyed it even more.4. Similar to ""Alcoholics Anonymous"", we now have the ""Jigsaw Survivor Group"". This was kind of hilarious to me. It's a laughable concept really, that one killer or a small group of killers could do enough damage to society to spawn a support group for the survivors. But it was all in good fun. And I really liked the idea, for these movies. I thought it was done well.5. The skewering of the ""Self Help"" or ""Life Coach"" movement. I get really sick of all the Gurus on TV, going on Oprah, hawking their books, and promising to change your life for the better or whatever. That's all a bunch of b.s., and only idiots fall for that kind of junk. It was cool to see the writers of Saw 7 have fun with that. Unfortunately, there are far too many real-life ""Bobby Dagens"" to count...6. Nice cringeworthy traps, as always... Seems like these were some of the worst. I could hardly watch some of it, even knowing it was fake. My mind might know it is fake, but it is still super hard to watch. So your higher-functioning brain knows it is fake, but you still can't stop yourself from reacting emotionally to it. That's the stroke of good filmaking right there.7. Mark Hoffman is now more of a killer than a true acolyte. This fits his character more anyway, I think. I never liked that guy as an acolyte. I just couldn't see him filling the role of Jigsaw. He just doesn't look the part. He looks stupid. More like a linebacker than the intelligent-yet-twisted philosopher that it takes to be Jigsaw.8. S.U.R.V.I.V.E. It took a repeat viewing for me to realize that in the title of Dagen's book, each letter stands for something. And then throughout Dagen's traps, the messages he finds from Jigsaw spell out the chapter headings of his book. This is a really nice touch that I didn't catch the first time around.9. What actually happened to Bobby Dagen? The movie doesn't really show. Which to me, implies that he is still alive. I like this. I mean, it shows Hoffman blow up his Jigsaw lab, but apparently he wasn't even running Bobby Dagen's traps. So Dagen still lives. So in a way, he survived his ordeal. Even if his girlfriend did get roasted with extra barbeque sauce.10. Who is actually running the traps? Must be Dr. Gordon, right? The movie makes you think it was Hoffman. But then toward the end, the truth comes out. It makes sense because throughout the movie, Hoffman is more obsessed with getting revenge on Jill than running traps.11. Who were the 2 acolytes with Dr. Gordon at the end? I liked this, because it shows the ""legacy"" of Jigsaw living on, with more acolytes. Is it really the end? No way!12. I own the 3D Blu-Ray of this movie, and I like the 3D this has. No, it isn't ""in your face"", but it is still quite nice. The blood and guts fly at you sometimes. Some scenes really stand out. Also, for the 3D they had to cut down on all the quick cuts and jittery camera movements. I REALLY LIKE THIS. I'm pretty sick of all the new movie action sequences that are filmed ""Transformers-style"", where everything jumps and shakes around so much you can't tell what is going on. For this alone, I am thankful for the 3D version.CONCLUSION:Saw 7 is not the greatest movie ever, but I liked it. I thought it was a fitting end to the series, at least for now. If there are no more Saw movies, then this is a good end. I am happy it is in my 3D movie collection.",4,My thoughts on Saw 3D / Saw 7,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,7634,"['have', 'watched', 'Saw', 'movies', 'like', 'lot', 'was', 'exception', 'think',

After six Saw movies I suspect that if you're currently reading this, you're obviously a fan who followed the Saw franchise. If you've never cared for Saw or always hated the franchise this one probably won't change your mind. However, for fans it's a fitting end to the series and we owe it to ourselves as fans to see this ""final"" Saw. After all we followed the entire series and waited year after year to see the new Saw movie (I personally did). In the past  we've seen Jigsaw die, the rise and fall of Amanda Young, Hoffman taking control and countless victims die. The seventh Saw brings something the other Saw movies didn't have : 3D, hence the title Saw 3D (although it is also referred to as Saw VII). Saw 3D ends it all, we get answers it and has the most traps out of all the Saw movies. Speaking of traps, they're not bad at all but I felt it was almost impossible to outdo what they previously did (Saw VI had some pretty interesting ones). The 3D, however, offers something different and makes VII that much more disgusting and gory.Saw 3D is all about putting the pieces of the puzzles together and end Saw while it's time (no one wants Saw 14 do they?) to. This time around we're following Bobby Dagen who wrote a book called ""Survive"" about his fake experience as a victim of Jigsaw. Dagen achieves fame because of his book and Jigsaw is determined to give him what he deserves. At the beginning we see a flashback sequence of Dr. Lawrence Gordon which finally explains what happened to him after the events of Saw 1 (I'm not spoiling anything, fans have been wondering what happened to Gordon ever since the original Saw, it's about time we found out). ) We also see what happens to Jigsaw's wife, Jill, who's been somewhat of a mystery since Saw V. Hoffman's future is also addressed and as claimed nothing is left without an answer. I find it a little insulting to fans that the two most important characters of Saw VII, Jigsaw and Dr. Gordon don't receive enough screen time, especially considering this is supposed to be the final Saw. Jigsaw barely has 5 minutes of screen time for the whole movie (perhaps they killed him a little too early in the series?) and Gordon who is very important to this final Saw doesn't get as much time as he should (his situation is mostly recaps unfortunately).Saw 3D is a fitting ending and puts the pieces of the puzzle together, likely to satisfy the fans but nothing exceptional for the fans who have seen all previous films. There was supposed to be an eight Saw film but after Saw VI did poorly at the box office (when compared to the other Saw films at least) it was decided that it would better for everyone if they ended the series as quick as possible. I think it might have been better had the time been taken to make two separate movies but Saw VII is an entertaining conclusion to the series. I'm not a huge of 3D but I admit it worked well in Saw 3D and it did add some excitement to the series. Most viewers certainly seem to think so, Saw 3D has earned over $ at the box office. Producer Mark Burg said that the DVD release of Saw VII will be 2D only and that 3D will be theater only. Saw 3D received mostly negative reviews from critics, but Saw movies nearly always get poor reviews from the ""professionals"" so if you're a fan don't bother with negativity and enjoy it for what it is. I liked Saw VII 3D for what it was, certainly not my favorite Saw film but decent.

After Bobby Dagen (Flanery) becomes rich after writing a book chronicling his survival from Jigsaws traps he finds himself in another one.  This time with bigger implications.  When the police finally find out the truth can they get to him in time?  Let me start off by saying I am a fan of the Saw franchise, in spite of the gore factor.  Jigsaw has always reminded me a little of Hannibal Lector, a brutal serial killer, but there is a reason for what he does.  The first one is excellent due to the fact it changed the genre, but through the years it decided to remove the plot aspects and see how many people they can cut up in 90 minutes.  This one was not nearly as graphic as the other ones (ran out of ideas?) and only one scene made me squirm while watching.  It is a Saw movie so you pretty much know what your gonna get.

The Bobby Dagen story seemed a little rushed, but there were some good twists. For all you critics who felt this was the weakest, I've seen my share of pointless sequels, this series hasn't had one. However, this chapter was very conclusive, so to continue the series after this, that would seem pointless-all the backstories are finally explained, and the series can finally rest, along with John Kramer.

When I saw ""Saw V,"" I thought ""Saw VI"" would be the final installment (with the secret about the box), but maybe the filmmakers just wanted more. Whatever the reason is, they made another ""Saw,"" which delivers what the long-running series have provided us with: deadly traps and gruesome deaths (and there's a lot of them).But there is one thing that is missing: Jigsaw, who has very limited screen time here. Though Tobin Bell is first-billed, he is hardly in the film, about four minutes or less, which is very disappointing. The film's story revolves around Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and Jill (Betsy Russell), plus Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flanery), a survivor of Jigsaw's trap, who turned kind of celebrity. Hoffman lacks charisma of Tobin Bell's iconic character; Jill has little to do in the story; as to Bobby, well, you know exactly what will happen to him. Some characters return, only to confuse us more with its rushed ending.It is reported that director Kevin Greutert, who did a much better job in ""Saw VI,"" was not originally attached to the project. He was called in on short notice, which might explain some of the plot holes and Jigsaw's near absence. Some of the fiendish traps (including the opening ""table"" trap) almost make up for it, though I believe Kevin Greutert could have done better with more time.

I'm not just talking in comparison with the other films.  The acting in this one is some of the worst I've EVER seen.-Because it was made in 3D, the graphics are cheesy and the gore effects are all pinkish and over-the-top.  The last bastion of reason to watch a Saw film (those brutal trap scenes) are effectively ruined by the 3D.-Whereas I thought this movie was going to really wrap up the series in a meaningful way, it instead has its own plotline for 80 minutes and lazily wraps up the ""big picture"" stuff in the final 10.
