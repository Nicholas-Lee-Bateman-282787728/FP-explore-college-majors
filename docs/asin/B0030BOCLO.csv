I love them because they are great teaching tools for teaching valuable life lessons. Friendship, honesty, faithfulness, dependability, caring, sharing, and punctuality are taught in these stories and isn't that what we all need to get along better in life. These later edition Thomas DVD's are fully animated and that just makes them all the more appealling to children. Hope they keep up the wonderful work.",5,Grandson loves this.,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,457,"['5', 'year', 'old', 'grandson', 'everything', 'Thomas', 'love', 'are', 'great', 'teaching', 'tools', 'teaching', 'valuable', 'life', 'lessons', 'Friendship', 'honesty', 'faithfulness', 'dependability', 'caring', 'sharing', 'punctuality', 'are', 'taught', 'stories', ""n't"", 'what', 'need', 'get', 'along', 'better', 'life', 'later', 'edition', 'Thomas', 'DVD', 'are', 'fully', 'animated', 'just', 'more', 'appealling', 'children', 'Hope', 'keep', 'wonderful', 'work']",N/A

I think it is a perfect DVD to get us in the mood for spring time and kite flying!  I also love the lessons that kids can learn from it such as working together and problem solving.  I also love the CG animation so it seems like a regular animated DVD.  Aidan was super excited to see Hiro from Hero of the Rails and that the trains talked, instead of just a narrator.I received this DVD to review but it is 100% my opinion.",5,Adorable as Usual!,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,536,"['usual', 'Thomas', 'DVD', 'was', 'hit', 'house', 'DVD', 'was', 'short', 'had', 'four', 'short', 'fun-filled', 'episodes', 'think', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'get', 'mood', 'spring', 'time', 'kite', 'flying', 'also', 'love', 'lessons', 'kids', 'can', 'learn', 'such', 'working', 'together', 'problem', 'solving', 'also', 'love', 'CG', 'animation', 'regular', 'animated', 'DVD', 'Aidan', 'was', 'super', 'excited', 'see', 'Hiro', 'Hero', 'Rails', 'trains', 'talked', 'instead', 'just', 'narrator.I', 'received', 'DVD', 'review', '100', '%', 'opinion']",N/A
1315071,A1Q0CZZ4CUP748,B0030BOCLO,David Stockett,"[1, 1]","This is a typical ""marking-time"" Thomas DVD.The title story is about a kite that gets away from Sir Topham Hatt's grandkids and Thomas chases it a little too far.  The episode could have ended earlier than it did.  Watching the kite go on...and on...and on...got a bit old.  But, my 2.5-year old son liked it, so that's all that mattered.  (I did wonder why the drivers didn't just get out of the trains and grab the darned thing!)Hiro makes an appearance in 2 episodes.  He comes back to Sodor to help out during the summer.  My son really likes Hiro.  When he saw Hiro at the docks, he yelled, ""HIRO!!!!""  Ohhhkay.  I guess so!Toby's 3-chime steam whistle...3-chime steam whistle...3-chime steam whistle...3-chime steam whistle.  Getting on your nerves, yet?  What until you hear it mentioned in the episode about 200 times.  You'll be reaching for the MUTE button!Lastly, Mr Perkins.  He is a bit more lively than in Splish, Splash, Splosh!  Someone must have told him to smile.  Maybe there's hope for him yet.On the whole, it fills a good 45-minutes.  That's quiet time when it counts.",3,"Hiro's back!

This Thomas is CGI animated and features Mr. Perkins in the middle of each episode, like Splish Splash Splosh. The first episode features Charlie and all of the other Sodor engines, while the next episode and those following have Hiro in them (he has returned for the summer from his homeland).When we got the package I told my 2 yr old that he got mail and he was so excited to open it up even though he had no idea what was inside. He was soooo happy to see a new Thomas movie that he made me take it to the sitters that day. I love Amazon!!!!",5,Another Thomas hit,1267660800,"03 4, 2010",2010,677,"['Ordered', 'pre-release', 'Amazon', 'Release', 'date', 'was', 'Tues', 'Mar', '2', 'got', 'delivered', 'free', 'Mar', '2', 'Prime', 'membership', 'Thomas', 'CGI', 'animated', 'Mr.', 'Perkins', 'middle', 'episode', 'Splish', 'Splash', 'Splosh', 'first', 'episode', 'features', 'Charlie', 'other', 'Sodor', 'engines', 'next', 'episode', 'following', 'have', 'Hiro', 'returned', 'summer', 'homeland', '.When', 'got', 'package', 'told', '2', 'yr', 'old', 'got', 'mail', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'open', 'up', 'even', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'inside', 'was', 'soooo', 'happy', 'see', 'new', 'Thomas', 'movie', 'made', 'take', 'sitters', 'day', 'love', 'Amazon']",N/A
