267304,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301798066,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Elvis became a film star with his debut performance in &#8216;Love Me Tender&#8217;.  It was a shocking role for the musical sensation, mostly because he has some questionable (at least as far as fans were concerned) character arcs towards the end, so much so that fans demanded a different ending (and kind of got it).  The film itself is decent at best; a war themed western that has a love triangle at the core and some ethical play with regards to the main character&#8217;s bout with the army, some stolen money and his decision to follow the law.  The acting is decent, and Presley delivers an admirable performance that paved the way for him to carve out a niche for himself.  He wasn&#8217;t a very polished actor, but he made it work and gave his fans what they wanted.  The biggest shock here is that &#8216;Love Me Tender&#8217; was not a contender for Oscar&#8217;s Original Song.  In fact, the fact that Elvis was NEVER nominated for a single song he wrote for his countless films is odd, since they were all very good (at least mostly) and he was such a star.",3,Elvis makes his mark&#8230;,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,1073,"['Elvis', 'became', 'film', 'star', 'debut', 'performance', '8216', 'Love', 'Me', 'Tender', '8217', 'was', 'shocking', 'role', 'musical', 'sensation', 'mostly', 'questionable', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'fans', 'were', 'concerned', 'character', 'arcs', 'end', 'so', 'much', 'fans', 'demanded', 'different', 'ending', 'kind', 'got', 'film', 'decent', 'best', 'war', 'themed', 'western', 'love', 'triangle', 'core', 'ethical', 'play', 'regards', 'main', 'character', '8217', 's', 'army', 'stolen', 'money', 'decision', 'follow', 'law', 'acting', 'decent', 'Presley', 'delivers', 'admirable', 'performance', 'paved', 'way', 'carve', 'out', 'niche', 'wasn', '8217', 'very', 'polished', 'actor', 'made', 'work', 'gave', 'fans', 'what', 'wanted', 'biggest', 'shock', 'here', '8216', 'Love', 'Me', 'Tender', '8217', 'was', 'not', 'contender', 'Oscar', '8217', 'Original', 'Song', 'fact', 'fact', 'Elvis', 'was', 'NEVER', 'nominated', 'single', 'song', 'wrote', 'countless', 'films', 'odd', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'least', 'mostly', 'was', 'such', 'star']",Love Me Tender VHS

267327,A2Y1D4PNZ1G7IH,6301798066,Mike Kurosky,"[14, 17]","In this western drama set immediately after the Civil War (originally titled ""The Reno Brothers""), Elvis appears in the secondary role of Clint Reno. This was the only time in his acting career that Elvis received second billing. Clint, the younger of the four Reno brothers, stayed behind to run the family farm during the war while his older brothers were off fighting for the Confederacy. Star Richard Egan plays Vance Reno, the elderst brother whom the family believes to have been killed in battle. Upon returning home, Vance is shocked to discover that Clint has married Vance's former sweetheart, Cathy, played by Debra Pagent (who appeared in The Ten Commandments). The love triangle, complicated by the greedy actions of some unscrupulous ex-Confederates, eventually pits brother against brother, resulting in Clint's death. The downbeat ending is tempered by the brother's reconciliation as Clint dies in Cathy's arms.Originally titled ""The Reno Brothers"", this western drama was re-titled after a number of articles announced that advanced sales for ""Love Me Tender""--one of the songs recorded for the film--exceeded a million copies. It was the first time advanced sales for a single release had ever suprassed the million mark, and the producers capitalized on the publicity by changing the film's title.The enormous amount of press coverage also affected the film's conclusion. During production, fanzines leaked that Elvis's character was supposed to die near the end of the film. As originally shot, the final scene features Mother Reno solemnly ringing the dinner bell as her three remaining sons toil in the fields. Pain and loss are registered on the faces of Mother Reno and Cathy, who mourn the death of Clint. Elvis's legion of fans were disturbed by the news that their idol was to be killed off in his first film and caused such a commotion that Twentieth Century-Fox shot an alternative ending in which Clint is spared. For reasons known only to the producers the second ending was rejected. Instead a third version of the ending was used and Clint is killed as called for in the original script, but the final shot superimposed a ghostly close-up of Elvis as Clint crooning ""Love Me Tender"" as his family slowly walks away from his grave. Hence the fans were then left with a final image of Elvis doing what he was famous for--singing.The same promotion surrounding Love Me Tender that generated excitement among the fans also generated loathing among the critics. Many were brutal in their assessment of Elvis's performance, particulary Time Magazine, comparing Elvis's acting and screen presence to that of a sausage, a ""Walt Disney Goldfish"", a corpse, and a cricket--all in the same brief review.If Elvis cried over the mean-spirited reviews, then he cried all the way to the bank. The film recouped its production costs within three days of release, guaranteeing that Elvis's Hollywood future would be lucrative.Produced for Twentieth Century Fox by David Weisbart.

I don't claim to be a follower of his movies either, but this one is a western and I AM a follower of westerns and Civil War movies and this passes well.This movie brings it highs and lows.  A trio of brothers fresh from a raid of a Union payroll find out that the war is over on their way to turn in the money to their General with the unit.  Their commander Vance (the eldest brother) decides there is no Confederate Government to turn the cash in to.  They split the dough and head home.  The family gets a shock that they are alive when they were told they were dead, while he gets a shock which the girl we was to marry is wed to his younger brother (Elivs).The plot twists when the Union army decides that to come after the former raiders, causing splits among the raiders and increasing the tension between the brothers.  The movie is more than passable (should likely be 3 3/4 stars vs 4's) and the acting is pretty good and the story moves along well.As far as Elvis goes, this movie proves he can act.  Its a shame that we don't see him in later years in more conventional movies such as this one.  This picture convinces me he could carry it off well.

It seems as though thousands of young teenage girls who had attended classes that very morning had suddenly vanished; like they had just disappeared off the face of the earth. Well, what the school authorities did not know that the young girls did know about was that they had snuck off to the historic Paramount movie theater in the heart of Times Square in New York to be among the first to actually witness a screening of Elvis Presley's very first feature film debut. A very large cardboard cut-out was seen placed atop of the theater's marquee, covered by a sheet of canvas. When the canvas was removed, the image revealed was that of Elvis Presley, smiling while strumming his guitar. Naturally, the girls all went crazy when this happened. This was an elaborate publicity scheme masterminded by Elvis' manager Col. Tom Parker. Originally released during the 1956 Thanksgiving holiday season, ""Love Me Tender"" quickly recovered its 1-and-a-half million dollar investment costs within less than three days in the cinemas. This was not only Elvis' screen debut; it was also the first and only time in his film career in which he recieved co-star billing. The movie was originally titled ""The Reno Brothers"". However, due to the rise in Elvis' overwhelming popularity, the studio decided to change the film's title. This was intended to capatalize on the film's title song, which eventually became another number one hit for Presley. The movie itself wound up becoming the second-highest grossing film of the year 1956, behind ""Giant"" starring Rock Hudson and James Dean. Elvis would follow this film with 3 more during the 50s: ""Loving You"", ""Jailhouse Rock"" and ""King Creole"". Shortly thereafter, he would go on to serve a 2-year stint in the United States Army overseas in Germany. Elvis himself had a very unique on-screen presence that helped to make him one of the most original personalities in the history of popular entertainment. Many people have thoroughly enjoyed his film career, which spans a total of 33 motion pictures. ""Love Me Tender"" is a truly classic movie with a brilliant stand-out performance from Elvis Presley, highlighted by 4 songs on the film's soundtrack.
