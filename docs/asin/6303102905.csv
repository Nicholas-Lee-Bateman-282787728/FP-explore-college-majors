That said, my expectations were set at an appropriately low bar, knowing this was an obscure made-for-TV movie from the 1970s. But I was a kid in the disco decade and always have a soft spot for that simpler time, especially its groovy old horror movies!  The cast here is fun and so is the story, but there's not much werewolf action and the monster makeup is pretty cheesy when you finally get to see it at the end. As for gore, there's nothing much, but it was made for TV, so you shouldn't expect more than a splash of blood now and again.  I'd love to see this remade on a larger budget with better gore and monster FX.This was based on the novelMoon of the Wolf, and I've always been curious to read it and see how well it stacks up to the movie version.",4,Good times if you dig groovy old 70s TV horror films,1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,834,"['not', 'lot', 'good', 'werewolf', 'movies', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'said', 'expectations', 'were', 'set', 'appropriately', 'low', 'bar', 'knowing', 'was', 'obscure', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', '1970s', 'was', 'kid', 'disco', 'decade', 'always', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'simpler', 'time', 'especially', 'groovy', 'old', 'horror', 'movies', 'cast', 'here', 'fun', 'so', 'story', 'not', 'much', 'werewolf', 'action', 'monster', 'makeup', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'when', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'end', 'gore', 'nothing', 'much', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'more', 'splash', 'blood', 'now', 'again', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'remade', 'larger', 'budget', 'better', 'gore', 'monster', 'FX.This', 'was', 'based', 'novelMoon', 'Wolf', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'curious', 'read', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'up', 'movie', 'version']",N/A

356686,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,6303102905,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[1, 1]","Disclaimer: The version of this film that I viewed is contained in theSci-Fi Classics 50 Movie Packproduced by Mill Creek. As such, I cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of the disc released by Westlake Budget. My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.Mill Creek Sci-Fi Classics 50 Movie Pack: Disc 1, Side A, third feature: MOON OF THE WOLF, a 1972 made-for-television film starring David Janssen and Barbara Rush, directed by Daniel Petrie (A RAISIN IN THE SUN, FORT APACHE, THE BRONX).I've always had a turn-up-your-nose attitude toward made for TV films - there used to be a lot of them on the networks (does anyone still make made for TV films?), especially back in the seventies, when I did most of my television watching.  While I haven't exactly changed my mind, there is a certain charm to some of these films nowadays - mostly in recognizing character actors I'd forgotten about, or even in just looking at the landscape through a 1970's lens.  MOON OF THE WOLF is no classic in any sense of the word, though it isn't a complete write-off either.  David Janssen stars as the sheriff of a small town in the Louisiana bayou, and it shouldn't be surprising - given the title of the film - that he's going to have a serious lycanthropy problem on his hands.  Given that the film was made for television, it also shouldn't be surprising that that lycanthropy is not going to put much of a bite on anyone either.Like I said, this film isn't rocket surgery, but everyone here turns in a competent, credible performance, even if it is in the service of a predictable script.  Anyone who's seen much seventies television is going to recognize several familiar faces here, even if the names don't ring a bell: Royal Dano and Geoffrey Lewis were two that especially stood out for me.  Maybe more fun than even the acting is a look at all those great old vehicles - my son mentioned to me that 'cars were cool back then.'  Yes, son, they were - whenever a Pontiac GTO is considered a family car and a Plymouth Barracuda a reasonable, rational choice for a young couple's first car, I think you can make a fair case that, indeed, cars WERE cool back then.I did enjoy David Janssen's performance in this not-bad, not-good-either film.  I liked his persona here, which, if I remember correctly, was consistent with most of his roles - competence might be the best word to sum it up, or perhaps the man who keeps his head when all about him are losing theirs, etc, etc.  It occurred to me that I don't see his type of acting much anymore, it at all.  Janssen isn't in charge because he's going to kick everyone's tail if they don't do what he tells them to, and he isn't just barely better than the bad guy he's chasing, and he isn't a vigilante, and he isn't some kind of cartoonish super-hero.  He's the sheriff, and he abides by the law and upholds it the best he can and people respect him for it.  Boy, what a square!  Who's going to believe in that kind of character anymore?  Sheesh, talk about nostalgia.Well, if you can get past the made-for-tv bias, you should find the flick at least average, but with a few tangential lagniappes for film buffs and those who appreciate early seventies cultural touchstones.  This Mill Creek release is probably as good as any other (night scenes are really tough to make out), but if the film sounds interesting at all, you can buy it outright in a collection like this or stream it free from IMDb.

Now available in a number of video versions, this is a little-known but quite serviceable production of some merit.  Set in the isolated Louisiana marshland, the story revolves around the local Sheriff's efforts to uncover the truth behind a young girl's mysterious and grisly death.  Was she killed by wild dogs, or by an ex-lover's revenge?  Acting is very good all-around, with David Janssen well-cast as the no-nonsense but likeable sheriff and Barbara Rush as the Southern Belle with a few secrets of her own.  The script is good, and the suspense methodically rises as the story progresses.  The only real weakness, as is often the case with low-budget horror films, is the monster make-up.  The eponymous werewolf doesn't look anything like the creature in the DVD art, but at least the director has the sense to keep the monster in the shadows most of the time so that the viewer's imagination can take up the slack.  The climax is something of a surprise, even if you've read the novel, as the hero in the end isn't exactly who you think it's going to be.

356694,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6303102905,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[0, 0]","This movie opens with a mysterious murder.  It turns out that the victim was pregnant, so Sheriff Aaron Whitaker, played by David Janssen of the original television show ""Fugitive,"" ""Harry-O,"" and dozens of other television shows and movies, investigates the murder as any other, with a twist that dogs apparently gnawed on the body.  Then there is a bed-ridden guy who keeps saying ""loup garou.""  Fans of werewolf movies know instantly that a loup garou is a werewolf, so we are waiting for the clueless cast of the movie to catch up.With the exception of the werewolf twist, this 1972 made-for-television movie plays much like mysteries of the 1970's and 1980's.  Sheriff Whitaker keeps probing and asking questions, tossing off any suggestions that there is anything supernatural until near the end.  Beautiful Barbara Rush (who is a veteran of film and television, with her last role as Ruth Camden on ""Seventh Heaven) plays Louis Rodanthe, who seems attracted to sheriff Whitaker.  Bradford Dillman, another veteran of television and movies such as ""The Enforcer"" and ""The Way We Were,"" frequently played a creepy bad guy in the 1970s and 1980s.  Dillman is Andrew Rodanthe, brother of Louis.  Andrew seems unhappy with Louise and the modest attention she gives to sheriff Whitaker.Several other characters a thrown into this mix to spice the plot and the movie.  The great character actor Royal Dano (""Something Wicked this Way Comes,"" ""The Right Stuff,"" ""The Dark Half,"" and dozens more) plays a quirky local character.  Geoffrey Lewis (""Blue Thunder,"" ""High Plains Drifter"" and dozens more) plays Lawrence, the father of the murdered girl.  Of course, Lawrence is out for revenge.As was typical with made-for-television horror movies, we see very little of the werewolf until near the end of the movie.  Indeed, we are about 40 minutes or so into the movie before the sheriff figures out there is something strange going on when someone, or something, rips apart a jail cell.  Things get stranger when one of the characters has an issue after smelling garlic.  At this point, veteran horror movie fans have pretty much figured out who the werewolf is, assuming they have not figured it out already.  The only question is how the cast discovers the werewolf and how the werewolf meets its end.Of course, we have to continue to churn through mundane dialogue to get to the end of the movie, without anyone figuring out what is killing the locals with teeth and claws.  The big clue for the cast comes about the same time we finally get our first real glimpse of the werewolf.  There is an interesting scene as the werewolf checks himself out of the hospital (neglecting to fill out the proper paperwork, I might add) and goes on a rampage.  Of course, at this point everyone knows who the werewolf is.  It helps, or does not help, that we know (and I am not telling) who the wolf's next victim will be.The last ten minutes of the movie are relatively exciting as the werewolf tries to get the last bite.  Sadly, werewolves are typically sad creatures who are ultimately doomed by their curse, so we know where this movie almost assuredly has to end.  Until the end, the excitement continues.With the exception of the werewolf twist, this movie is much like a typical mystery movie of the era.  We have a cast of characters played by well-known actors.  Everything is suitably low budget, including the werewolf makeup - no costume for this movie.  Sadly, we do not see any transitions from man to werewolf or back again.  Since this movie was made-for-television, we also see very little blood or gore.  Even with the drawbacks, if you are a huge fan of werewolf movies, you need to see this one, just to say you did.  Some people seem to enjoy this movie more than once, so maybe you should have this one for your collection.  This movie seems to be in the public domain and is available in several versions and in at least one collection, so there are many opportunities to acquire it.Enjoy!",3,Serviceable Low Budget Werewolf Movie of the 70's,1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,3999,"['movie', 'mysterious', 'murder', 'out', 'victim', 'was', 'pregnant', 'so', 'Sheriff', 'Aaron', 'Whitaker', 'played', 'David', 'Janssen', 'original', 'television', 'show', 'Fugitive', 'Harry-O', 'dozens', 'other', 'television', 'shows', 'movies', 'murder', 'other', 'twist', 'dogs', 'apparently', 'gnawed', 'body', 'Then', 'bed-ridden', 'guy', 'who', 'saying', 'loup', 'garou', 'Fans', 'werewolf', 'movies', 'know', 'instantly', 'loup', 'garou', 'werewolf', 'are', 'waiting', 'clueless', 'cast', 'movie', 'catch', 'exception', 'werewolf', 'twist', '1972', 'made-for-television', 'movie', 'much', 'mysteries', '1970', '1980', 'Sheriff', 'Whitaker', 'probing', 'asking', 'questions', 'tossing', 'off', 'suggestions', 'anything', 'supernatural', 'end', 'Beautiful', 'Barbara', 'Rush', 'who', 'veteran', 'film', 'television', 'last', 'role', 'Ruth', 'Camden', 'Seventh', 'Heaven', 'Louis', 'Rodanthe', 'who', 'attracted', 'sheriff', 'Whitaker', 'Bradford', 'Dillman', 'veteran', 'television', 'movies', 'such', 'Enforcer', 'Way', 'Were', 'frequently', 'played', 'creepy', 'bad', 'guy', '1970s', '1980s', 'Dillman', 'Andrew', 'Rodanthe', 'brother', 'Louis', 'Andrew', 'unhappy', 'Louise', 'modest', 'attention', 'sheriff', 'Whitaker.Several', 'other', 'characters', 'thrown', 'mix', 'spice', 'plot', 'movie', 'great', 'character', 'actor', 'Royal', 'Dano', 'Something', 'Wicked', 'Way', 'Comes', 'Right', 'Stuff', 'Dark', 'Half', 'more', 'quirky', 'local', 'character', 'Geoffrey', 'Lewis', 'Blue', 'Thunder', 'High', 'Drifter', 'more', 'Lawrence', 'father', 'murdered', 'girl', 'course', 'Lawrence', 'out', 'revenge.As', 'was', 'typical', 'made-for-television', 'horror', 'movies', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'werewolf', 'end', 'movie', 'Indeed', 'are', '40', 'minutes', 'so', 'movie', 'sheriff', 'out', 'something', 'strange', 'going', 'when', 'someone', 'something', 'apart', 'jail', 'cell', 'Things', 'get', 'stranger', 'when', 'one', 'characters', 'issue', 'smelling', 'garlic', 'point', 'veteran', 'horror', 'movie', 'fans', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'figured', 'out', 'who', 'werewolf', 'assuming', 'have', 'not', 'figured', 'out', 'already', 'only', 'question', 'how', 'cast', 'werewolf', 'how', 'werewolf', 'end.Of', 'course', 'have', 'continue', 'churn', 'mundane', 'dialogue', 'get', 'end', 'movie', 'anyone', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'killing', 'locals', 'teeth', 'claws', 'big', 'clue', 'cast', 'same', 'time', 'finally', 'get', 'first', 'real', 'glimpse', 'werewolf', 'interesting', 'scene', 'werewolf', 'hospital', 'neglecting', 'fill', 'out', 'proper', 'paperwork', 'might', 'add', 'rampage', 'course', 'point', 'everyone', 'who', 'werewolf', 'not', 'help', 'know', 'am', 'not', 'telling', 'who', 'wolf', 'next', 'victim', 'will', 'be.The', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'relatively', 'exciting', 'werewolf', 'get', 'last', 'bite', 'Sadly', 'werewolves', 'are', 'typically', 'sad', 'creatures', 'who', 'are', 'ultimately', 'doomed', 'curse', 'know', 'where', 'movie', 'almost', 'assuredly', 'end', 'end', 'excitement', 'exception', 'werewolf', 'twist', 'movie', 'much', 'typical', 'mystery', 'movie', 'era', 'have', 'cast', 'characters', 'played', 'well-known', 'actors', 'Everything', 'suitably', 'low', 'budget', 'including', 'werewolf', 'makeup', 'costume', 'movie', 'Sadly', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'transitions', 'man', 'werewolf', 'back', 'again', 'movie', 'was', 'made-for-television', 'also', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'blood', 'gore', 'Even', 'drawbacks', 'are', 'huge', 'fan', 'werewolf', 'movies', 'need', 'see', 'one', 'just', 'say', 'did', 'people', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'one', 'collection', 'movie', 'be', 'public', 'domain', 'available', 'several', 'versions', 'least', 'one', 'collection', 'are', 'many', 'opportunities', 'acquire', 'it.Enjoy']",N/A

This 1972 made for TV stinker stars the normally respectable David Janssen as a sheriff in a backwater Louisiana town trying to track a savage killer.The story starts with the murder of a girl, and false leads abound: she was pregnant by one guy, smuggling drugs for another, romantically involved with a third, etc. Despite the small town soap opera, David Janssen makes an arrest, but finds he has the wrong guy when the arrestee and a deputy are savagely killed. Throughout this mess there is the old, dying psychic man babbling in French (remember, this is Cajun country) about the ""loup-garou."" At first I had absolutely no clue what he was going on about, as ""loup-garou"" is not in my French vocabulary. A quick consultation with my French dictionary shed some light on the situation: ""loup-garou"" means ""werewolf"" in French.When all is said and done it turns out that the werewolf is none other than Bradford Dillman, the smarmy aristocratic Cajun Mogul-in-Chief. The movie doesn't show the werewolf until close to the end, but believe me bad movie fans, it is worth the wait. The makeup makes Dillman look like a very Amish werewolf in the facial hair department. He is also a spectacularly scrawny, agile, and whiny werewolf. I am especially fond of the ""werewolf in the flaming barn"" shots which are perhaps the least realistic depiction of fire that I have ever seen in a movie. I will not give away the stirring conclusion to the film, but suffice it to say that you won't be even a bit surprised.This one gets two stars for campy entertainment value. David Janssen is not bad as the sheriff; the rest of the cast is less good, while the townsfolk are downright creepy. A wardrobe warning: be prepared for Janssen's habit of unbuttoning his shirt way too low; his chest hair looks more like a weasel pelt attached to his anterior by Velcro. What I am saying here is that it is really not a good look for him.

David Janssen is the southern sheriff with a string of bloody murders on his hands.  An incoherent, bed-ridden old man down on the bayou babbles in a Cajun dialect of something that sounds like ""luke-a-ruke.""  As the victims pile up, the sheriff finally learns that the old man is saying ""Werewolf!""  (loup garou). This movie is a mixed blessing.  Most of the script devotes itself to fathoming the mystery, and red herrings abound.  Time is also spent on the subplot of a mild flirtation between Janssen and Barbara Rush.  She is of the local gentry, and her brother disapproves of Janssen's attentiveness.  About 59 minutes into the 73-minute film, the movie shifts gears and the horror elements finally kick in.  The local Larry Talbot suffers a peculiar genetic malady that usually can be controlled by drugs.  Things get serious one night when the moon is full, and a young girl is brutally murdered.  The fright makeup looks as if it came from a shopping mall Halloween shop.  Where is Jack Pierce when you need him?  Nevertheless, there is some suspense.  As the werewolf pounds on the door, Rush barricades herself into the spooky antebellum mansion.  There are no silver bullets to report, but there is a handy pistol with sanctified cartridges that have been blessed.  Great foresight on someone's part.  The '70s cars and clothes add to the modest budget look of the movie.  Die-hard fans of horror thrillers should be pleased.

Only 74  minutes long (this premiered on ABC-TV's weekly 90-minute program of original TV movies) it naturally moves pretty fast even when not much happens.  David Janssen stars as a small-town sheriff in Louisiana on the trail of the killer of a young woman whose mauled body was found by some locals.  Eventually when the killer strikes again, this time tearing out the bars of a local jail with his bare hands, it's clear this is something other than human.I enjoyed this intriguing little movie even if it wasn't particularly well-written (some of Janssen's ""suspects"" seem dubious possibilities and why is the werewolf so selective in whom he kills, he has a chance to get several at the hospital, is he an elitist or something??).  Very effectively filmed on location in Louisiana, movie buffs may recognize the Bradford Dillman/Barbara Rush home as Houmas House, the famed antebellum mansion that was Bette Davis' home in HUSH HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE about a decade earlier (apparently Hollywood thinks all rich people in the South still live in Civil War era mansions!)  The cast is good although it is amusing to hear Janssen, Geoffrey Lewis, and John Beradino all pronounce ""pecan"" differently.  I particularly liked Bradford Dillman in this, looking quite handsome and coming across very Tony Perkinesque (I was startled to discover he was 42 at the time, a  year older than Janssen who looked more than a decade his senior).This film apparently fell into public domain as there are multiple releases of it on DVD and film print quality may vary.

We know the culprit at about an hour into the production as the sheriff suspects everyone. The werewolf make-up and special effects are low budget as in ""Full Moon High"" low budget. Perhaps the selling point of this whole film is that it is so low budget, David Jansen's shirt has buttons that don't work, sporting more hair than the werewolf he hunts. Suspect Barbara Rush adds little to the film. The accents were more hillbilly than Cajun. The part of the gypsy is taken over by an old man who reads palms.This isn't a bad film for a compilation collection, but by itself it is not worth owning.

I had a few minor issues with the film even then but overall it is a good horror film and not too frightening.  The issues I had remain even now - althought there IS  a Marsh Island off the coast of Louisiana it is an uninhabited wild life refuge - there are no roads, towns or houses  and no one lives there.  It IS a marsh with little solid ground.  The scenes of the court house and town area in the film were filmed in the old city of Clinton, Louisiana and the scenes of the Plantation house were filmed at Bocage Plantation House between Baton Rouge and New Orleans.  My biggest issue however is with the Hollywood style Georgian Southern accent - you won't hear that in South Louisiana around the Cajun French - they speak English with the Cajun Accent.  And NOBODY in Cajun Louisiana would not know what the old man speaking the French and repeating ""loup garou"" (pronounced LOO GAHROO) was saying and everyone knows exactly what that means.  Otherwise it is a suspensful movie.
