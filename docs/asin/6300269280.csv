For starters, the opening scene with the newlywed Adam West going into an emotional breakdown and dashing out of his bridal suite in despair is PRICELESS. The opening title sequence, which consists of an excellent music theme over stark and simple high-contrast animated graphics, is also wonderful.The affable Paul Newman, who seems right at home in any era, anchors the film as the young attorney Anthony Lawrence (he portrays a man in his early 20's, but when the film was made he was actually 35!). His love interest, played by the stunningly beautiful Barbara Rush -- I couldn't take my eyes off her! Wow, what a luscious woman!Robert Vaughn is melodramatic and charismatic as Lawrence's troubled best friend; Otto Kruger and John Williams are refreshingly stuffy and avuncular as Lawrence's legal mentors, and the courtroom scene, with Richard Deacon as an arrogant butler testifying on the stand, is indispensable for Deacon fans.This film reveals a world more obsessed with status, social class, and family names than we are today. It seems very odd, but I guess it was a reflection of the times. I'm not sure times have changed all that much. You can be the judge.

Movies tend to fall short of good novels because they are too limited in what they can cover.  But this movie does quite well.  In the book there were three generations of Irish.  The hero's grandmother is the immigrant who got the family to America.  Next Tony (the hero) gets a key block in the getting ahead game when his second generation mother finds a crack in society's door but doesn't quite get in herself.  But she keeps her foot in the door in that commitment to the future that our immigrant ancesters had that has done many of us a lot of good.  Her commitment put Tony in a position to belong IF he can graduate from the right school and prove himself in a Society level law firm.Tony and his mother get behind the scenes help from Tony's real father a successful and politically connected Phila contractor who sounds an awful lot like the famous John Kelly (Grace Kelly's Grandfather).  Once again the Irish immigrant class are working with a commitment to the future of their people and their family. The real father sees to it that Tony can afford Princeton and law school.  And Dad keeps Tony's mother's secret.  They even keep it from Tony himself.Tony does some bad things. He gets suckered by his sweetheart's father when the lovers decide to marry before Tony has his law degree.  So he loses the girl.  Next he steals a a plum summer job out from under one of his college buddies to advance his own career.Next Tony does some good things.  His super influential summer employer's young wife thinks she is in love with Tony.  Tony actually turns her down while making her feel good about the whole thing.  He's learning to think on his back as well as his feet.  And he uses his inherited Irish blarney to great effect.Next he saves his old Princeton Buddy from a murder rap, earning the undying gratitude of a socially very important main line family.  His original girl friend, good looking and also well connected, marries Tony after her husband is killed in Korea.  She wanted him even though she thought he was a sell out.  But when she watches him battle his way through a tough criminal rap, in a high risk situation, out of loyalty to his old pal, she stands with a look of admiration and says something like &quot;you are the man.  I'm yours for ever&quot;At that point I was wishing that I was Tony.",5,The Irish make it again!,1073692800,"01 10, 2004",2004,2360,"['read', 'book', 'years', 'ago', 'Movies', 'tend', 'fall', 'short', 'good', 'novels', 'are', 'too', 'limited', 'what', 'can', 'cover', 'movie', 'quite', 'well', 'book', 'were', 'three', 'generations', 'Irish', 'hero', 'grandmother', 'immigrant', 'who', 'got', 'family', 'America', 'Next', 'Tony', 'hero', 'key', 'block', 'getting', 'ahead', 'game', 'when', 'second', 'generation', 'mother', 'crack', 'society', 'door', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'foot', 'door', 'commitment', 'future', 'immigrant', 'ancesters', 'had', 'done', 'many', 'lot', 'good', 'commitment', 'put', 'Tony', 'position', 'belong', 'IF', 'can', 'graduate', 'right', 'school', 'prove', 'Society', 'level', 'law', 'firm.Tony', 'mother', 'get', 'scenes', 'help', 'Tony', 'real', 'father', 'successful', 'politically', 'connected', 'Phila', 'contractor', 'who', 'awful', 'lot', 'famous', 'John', 'Kelly', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'Grandfather', 'Once', 'again', 'Irish', 'immigrant', 'class', 'are', 'working', 'commitment', 'future', 'people', 'family', 'real', 'father', 'sees', 'Tony', 'can', 'afford', 'Princeton', 'law', 'school', 'Dad', 'Tony', 'mother', 'secret', 'even', 'keep', 'Tony', 'himself.Tony', 'bad', 'things', 'suckered', 'sweetheart', 'father', 'when', 'lovers', 'decide', 'marry', 'Tony', 'law', 'degree', 'girl', 'plum', 'summer', 'job', 'one', 'college', 'buddies', 'advance', 'own', 'career.Next', 'Tony', 'good', 'things', 'super', 'influential', 'summer', 'employer', 'young', 'wife', 'love', 'Tony', 'Tony', 'actually', 'down', 'making', 'feel', 'good', 'whole', 'thing', 'learning', 'think', 'back', 'as', 'well', 'feet', 'inherited', 'Irish', 'blarney', 'great', 'effect.Next', 'old', 'Princeton', 'Buddy', 'murder', 'rap', 'earning', 'undying', 'gratitude', 'socially', 'very', 'important', 'main', 'line', 'family', 'original', 'girl', 'friend', 'good', 'looking', 'also', 'well', 'connected', 'marries', 'Tony', 'husband', 'killed', 'Korea', 'wanted', 'even', 'thought', 'was', 'sell', 'out', 'when', 'battle', 'way', 'tough', 'criminal', 'rap', 'high', 'risk', 'situation', 'loyalty', 'old', 'pal', 'look', 'admiration', 'something', 'quot', 'are', 'man', ""'m"", 'yours', 'ever', 'quot', 'point', 'was', 'wishing', 'was', 'Tony']",The Young Philadelphians VHS

These would include Villanova, Paoli, Swarthmore, Haverford, Radnor, etc. All very upscale and socially desireable communities. Rittenhouse Square (the opening when the wedding takes place) is in Center City Philadelphia. Also ritzy, but not Main Line. South Philadelphia is...well, South Philadelphia. The stereotypes are well-drawn, quite full of themselves and very over the top. Then again, maybe the rich really are that different.

Directed by Vincent Sherman, who had made some of Joan Crawford's tough career-woman vehicles, this slick soap opera actually finds Newman in a Crawford role...Tony Lawrence is born into poverty, and his mother brings him up to believe that social position, good contacts and money are all that matter... At first he resists, but events harden him into a cynical opportunist, and he sets out on an amoral journey to the top of his law firm...

Finally deciding that success isn't worth, the price, he chooses integrity, risking the enmity of a prominent family by defending an alcoholic friend...Tony, the ruthless opportunist, is superficially another Ben Quick (""The Long, Hot Summer""), but here the writing is superficially and Newman responds with an appropriately routine portrayal...

Tony doesn't even have the underlying devilish charm, only an attractive face... And at crucial moments--when Tony's girl marries another man and when he finds out who his real father is--Newman falls back on heavy breathing, rapid blinking and feverish lip movements...Barbara Rush gives her best performance as the depressed, cynical, high society daughter of one of Philadelphia's most prominent attorney Gilbert Dickson (John Williams).Robert Vaughn is excellent as the alcoholic victim, cheated and inherited...Billia Burke is delightful as the old millionairess whom Tony wins her trust by persuading her to transfer the administration of her possessions to a firm that could save her 'some' taxes...""The Young Philadelphians"" is Vincent Sherman's best film of the fifties, with excellent supporting cast specially by Alexis Smith as the dissatisfied wife of an aging lawyer collaborating in unifying the arguments of the dramatic action...With 3 Academy Award Nominations for Best Supporting Actor (Vaughn), Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design, the film is gleamingly done and acted with assurance...",4,The magnificent temptress Alexis Smith taking the longest walk of her life after midnight...,1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,2348,"['Warners', 'Young', 'Philadelphians', 'Newman', 'young', 'lawyer', 'who', 'values', 'search', 'success', 'Directed', 'Vincent', 'Sherman', 'who', 'had', 'made', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'tough', 'career-woman', 'vehicles', 'slick', 'soap', 'opera', 'actually', 'Newman', 'Crawford', 'role', 'Tony', 'Lawrence', 'born', 'poverty', 'mother', 'up', 'believe', 'social', 'position', 'good', 'contacts', 'money', 'are', 'matter', 'first', 'events', 'harden', 'cynical', 'opportunist', 'out', 'amoral', 'journey', 'top', 'law', 'firm', 'romances', 'success', 'youthful', 'idealism', 'unhappy', 'Finally', 'deciding', 'success', ""n't"", 'worth', 'price', 'integrity', 'risking', 'enmity', 'prominent', 'family', 'defending', 'alcoholic', 'friend', 'Tony', 'ruthless', 'opportunist', 'superficially', 'Ben', 'Quick', 'Long', 'Hot', 'Summer', 'here', 'writing', 'superficially', 'Newman', 'appropriately', 'routine', 'portrayal', 'motions', 'well', 'conveying', 'smiling', 'eager', 'innocent', 'beginning', 'intense', 'jaded', 'conniver', 'later', 'surface', 'depth', 'feeling', 'Tony', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'underlying', 'devilish', 'charm', 'only', 'attractive', 'face', 'crucial', 'moments', 'when', 'Tony', 'girl', 'man', 'when', 'out', 'who', 'real', 'father', 'Newman', 'back', 'heavy', 'breathing', 'rapid', 'blinking', 'feverish', 'lip', 'movements', 'Barbara', 'Rush', 'best', 'performance', 'depressed', 'cynical', 'high', 'society', 'daughter', 'one', 'Philadelphia', 'most', 'prominent', 'attorney', 'Gilbert', 'Dickson', 'John', 'Williams', '.Robert', 'Vaughn', 'excellent', 'alcoholic', 'victim', 'cheated', 'inherited', 'Billia', 'Burke', 'delightful', 'old', 'millionairess', 'whom', 'Tony', 'trust', 'persuading', 'transfer', 'administration', 'possessions', 'firm', 'could', 'save', ""'some"", 'taxes', 'Young', 'Philadelphians', 'Vincent', 'Sherman', 'best', 'film', 'fifties', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'specially', 'Alexis', 'Smith', 'dissatisfied', 'wife', 'aging', 'lawyer', 'collaborating', 'unifying', 'arguments', 'dramatic', 'action', '3', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Nominations', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Vaughn', 'Best', 'Cinematography', 'Best', 'Costume', 'Design', 'film', 'gleamingly', 'done', 'acted', 'assurance']",The Young Philadelphians VHS
