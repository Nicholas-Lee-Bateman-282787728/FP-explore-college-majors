In a nutshell, this film chronicles the life of the ancient warrior Asoka and his journey to becoming a holy monk of some sort at the end. The movie was just great. A wonderful mix of comedy, romance, drama and dance.I was most impressed with the performance of Kareena Kapoor who portrays Princess Kaurwaki. I was amazed how effortlessy she was able to switch from silly to serious to dancer throughout the movie. She steals every scene she is in. ""King"" Khan who portrays Asoka/Pawan is also just as compelling. The dance numbers are also great. I'm still humming some of the tunes in my head.All in all, a highly entertaining and moving story with one of the most tragic endings I have ever seen.",5,Musical History Lesson,1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,719,"['loved', 'movie', 'nutshell', 'film', 'life', 'ancient', 'warrior', 'Asoka', 'journey', 'becoming', 'holy', 'monk', 'sort', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'great', 'wonderful', 'mix', 'comedy', 'romance', 'drama', 'dance.I', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'performance', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'who', 'Princess', 'Kaurwaki', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'effortlessy', 'was', 'able', 'switch', 'silly', 'serious', 'dancer', 'movie', 'scene', 'King', 'Khan', 'who', 'Asoka/Pawan', 'also', 'just', 'compelling', 'dance', 'numbers', 'are', 'also', 'great', ""'m"", 'still', 'humming', 'tunes', 'head.All', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'moving', 'story', 'one', 'most', 'tragic', 'endings', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

There are dozens of other Shahrukh Khan movies far better than this one, and many more beautiful Indian actresses rather than Kareena Kapoor. The biggest problem with this movie is that its an insult to one of India's most revered leaders. Its like making a movie about George Washington complete with hiphop music and the story ends before he becomes president. If you go to Wikipedia and look up Ashoka, you'll see that he has a powerful influence even on modern day India and Buddhism. Unfortunately, someone thought they could make a buck by condensing a small part of his life into a action/romance. Its just terrible. The singing and dancing are totally inappropriate. The battle scenes are small and a bit cheesy. The story is very confused (which woman does he love? why is he killing his brothers? why is he attacking Kalinga, why was he wandering around in Kalinga by himself incognito to start?), but less so if you read the real story to find the ""backstory"". And at the end, when I thought maybe it has some redeeming value where it shows Ashoka's great transformation, it suddenly ends. Its just garbage. If you want to see Khan in his glory see Khabie Kushie Khabe Gum, Dil Se or even Devdas. At least those have better songs, better dancing, appropriate musical interludes, better story, emotional arc, better costumes, and better family values and sense of romance. This movie was just about making a quick buck, and Khan should be ashamed to be a part of it.",2,"Lousy, Exploitative, and Waste of Time and Talent",1183334400,"07 2, 2007",2007,1494,"['Avoid', 'movie', 'are', 'dozens', 'other', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'movies', 'far', 'better', 'one', 'many', 'more', 'beautiful', 'Indian', 'rather', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'insult', 'one', 'India', 'most', 'revered', 'leaders', 'making', 'movie', 'George', 'Washington', 'complete', 'hiphop', 'music', 'story', 'president', 'go', 'Wikipedia', 'look', 'up', 'Ashoka', ""'ll"", 'see', 'powerful', 'influence', 'even', 'modern', 'day', 'India', 'Buddhism', 'Unfortunately', 'someone', 'thought', 'could', 'make', 'buck', 'condensing', 'small', 'part', 'life', 'action/romance', 'just', 'terrible', 'singing', 'dancing', 'are', 'totally', 'inappropriate', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'small', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'story', 'very', 'confused', 'woman', 'love', 'why', 'killing', 'brothers', 'why', 'attacking', 'Kalinga', 'why', 'was', 'wandering', 'around', 'Kalinga', 'incognito', 'start', 'less', 'so', 'read', 'real', 'story', 'find', 'backstory', 'end', 'when', 'thought', 'maybe', 'redeeming', 'value', 'where', 'Ashoka', 'great', 'transformation', 'suddenly', 'just', 'garbage', 'want', 'see', 'Khan', 'glory', 'see', 'Khabie', 'Kushie', 'Khabe', 'Gum', 'Dil', 'Se', 'even', 'Devdas', 'least', 'have', 'better', 'songs', 'better', 'dancing', 'appropriate', 'musical', 'interludes', 'better', 'story', 'emotional', 'arc', 'better', 'costumes', 'better', 'family', 'values', 'sense', 'romance', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'making', 'quick', 'buck', 'Khan', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'be', 'part']",N/A
680733,AU78WGAXA3IY1,B00005RYLQ,"Chelle ""Chelle""","[4, 5]","I was browsing about in the DVD section of a local store when I found ASOKA. The cover, admittedly, was appealing, which would account for my hand reaching toward it eagerly. When I read the back and discovered that it had some connection to Buddhism, I decided to call up a friend who is studying Buddhism and make a night of it. I am most thankful that I did.After the first ten to fifteen minutes I was groaning. I thought, ""Great, this movie is well over two hours long and we're going to be stuck watching a bad documentary with really poor picture quality."" My friend urged me to turn it off, but I resisted, and within another twenty minutes we were both hooked. I found the film to be irresistible.ASOKA runs the gamut between humor and sorrow with grace. During the first half I often found myself laughing at a bit of dialogue or a quick facial expression. I'm sure the musical interludes weren't meant to be funny, but, well, they were and I don't think there is anything wrong with being amused by them. It added to the experience in a wonderful way and set it apart from other epics of its kind. The anger and despair of the second half was infectious. Prince Asoka was tormented and so in turn was the viewer.Shah Rukh Khan can be credited with the success of this film. He covers vast emotional ground with the dignity of the royalty that he was portraying. I've rarely said that someone was a joy to watch, but, really, Khan was. A lot of the humor lies in the subtlety of his expression, in the carriage of his character, and he pulls it off wonderfully. Truly, I hope he makes more movies that are then available in the States.I will stick with what I initially said, though. The picture quality throughout the movie seemed uneven to me. It started off rather poorly, improved, it would slip and then reclaim itself. I have no idea of why this might have been. But that's only a little complaint. It didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film.All I can say is that I had an emotional reaction to this film after it was over and I knew immediately that I'd want to watch it again. Sometimes it's hard to understand why a certain film clicks with you, but you just accept it and recommend it to others, hoping they find/see the same thing that you did.",4,A wonderful find,1032048000,"09 15, 2002",2002,2270,"['was', 'browsing', 'about', 'DVD', 'section', 'local', 'store', 'when', 'found', 'ASOKA', 'cover', 'admittedly', 'was', 'appealing', 'would', 'account', 'hand', 'reaching', 'eagerly', 'When', 'read', 'back', 'discovered', 'had', 'connection', 'Buddhism', 'decided', 'call', 'up', 'friend', 'who', 'studying', 'Buddhism', 'make', 'night', 'am', 'most', 'thankful', 'did.After', 'first', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'was', 'groaning', 'thought', 'Great', 'movie', 'well', 'two', 'hours', 'long', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'stuck', 'watching', 'bad', 'documentary', 'really', 'poor', 'picture', 'quality', 'friend', 'urged', 'turn', 'off', 'resisted', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'were', 'hooked', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'irresistible.ASOKA', 'gamut', 'humor', 'sorrow', 'grace', 'first', 'half', 'often', 'found', 'laughing', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'quick', 'facial', 'expression', ""'m"", 'sure', 'musical', 'interludes', 'were', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'funny', 'well', 'were', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'wrong', 'being', 'amused', 'added', 'experience', 'wonderful', 'way', 'set', 'apart', 'other', 'epics', 'kind', 'anger', 'despair', 'second', 'half', 'was', 'infectious', 'Prince', 'Asoka', 'was', 'tormented', 'so', 'turn', 'was', 'viewer.Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'can', 'be', 'credited', 'success', 'film', 'vast', 'emotional', 'ground', 'dignity', 'royalty', 'was', 'portraying', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'said', 'someone', 'was', 'joy', 'watch', 'really', 'Khan', 'was', 'lot', 'humor', 'subtlety', 'expression', 'carriage', 'character', 'off', 'wonderfully', 'Truly', 'hope', 'more', 'movies', 'are', 'then', 'available', 'States.I', 'will', 'stick', 'what', 'initially', 'said', 'though', 'picture', 'quality', 'movie', 'seemed', 'uneven', 'started', 'off', 'rather', 'poorly', 'improved', 'would', 'slip', 'then', 'reclaim', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'little', 'complaint', 'did', ""n't"", 'detract', 'enjoyment', 'film.All', 'can', 'say', 'had', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'film', 'was', 'knew', 'immediately', ""'d"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'certain', 'film', 'clicks', 'just', 'accept', 'recommend', 'others', 'hoping', 'find/see', 'same', 'thing', 'did']",N/A

This is Bollywood!I've seen only a few other Bollywood movies and I must give kudos to this one in particular for its female characters.  There isn't one silly twitchy ingenue in the whole movie.  All three of the main female characters, Asoka's mother, his lover and his wife, are strong, each is a unique and interesting individual and each in her own way gives this movie its moral balast. I am so impressed.Also, the actor playing the Emperor Asoka is a hunk and a half.  And he can act.  Even when his character becomes vicious and violent, you continue to care about him and not just because he's pretty.However, I did knock off one star for the really dreadful ""comic relief"" scenes with the three guards whose dialog always reveals that one of the guard's wives is unfaithful without that guard being aware of it.

680741,A3Q1KSLCTE0VF0,B00005RYLQ,Jeffrey Lehman,"[0, 0]","Most of what people know about Asoka is pure fantasy.  For example, it is widely believed that Ashoka, out of disgust and sorrow over all the blood he shed, renounces violence and becomes a Buddhist.  The details about this, however, comes from text written several hundred years after his death.  Historic fact is that he probably did not become a Buddhist, and he became the model emperor in order to peacefully consolidate his conquests.  If he had renounced violence and was sorry for what he had done, why did he not return the land he had taken?  Any good history book will clarify this.Now, about the film:The film Asoka takes the fantasy, and fantasizes about it, creating a whole new level of fantasy, which is the story the film follows.  It is pure Bollywood melodrama:  boy meets girl, they fall in love, they get separated, boy thinks girl dies, boy eventually remarries, invades her country, and fights her army in  battle.  Okay, the last bit doesn't fit any of the normal formulas.Having said all of that, if you accept that almost nothing of the  story is at all factual, and that it is a ""heightened emotional drama"", as is the usual case with Indian films, then Asoka is quite an enjoyable film.  The story has its own interest, and the song and dance bits are fascinating.  The cinematography is quite good by Bollywood standards.

680742,A2UJG6T6DOWKQF,B00005RYLQ,Jennifer Hopfinger,"[1, 1]","When monsters become monks, it's usually the stuff of legends. But Asoka--a bloodthirsty emperor who later renounced violence--was a real person. The 2001 film 'Asoka,' about his early life, captures in mesmerizing fashion how such an unlikely conversion could take place.Asoka was the favorite grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, the emperor of the kingdom of Magadha in the third century BC. Chandragupta beat back the armies of Alexander the Great, conquered most of the Indian subcontinent, and then adopted the Jain religion, renounced his throne, and died from fasting. The empire fell to his son Bindusara, whose heir apparent was Asoka's eldest brother Susima.And that's where the film begins. There's no trace of the Asoka who would one day convert to Buddhism and become one of the world's first great humanitarians, a man who made nonviolence the law of his vast land. Shahrukh Khan plays the young Asoka, a skilled and merciless warrior with ruthless political ambition, a role perfectly suited to Khan's intense dramatic style (he always shines as an antihero). Asoka is an animal in a kill-or-be-killed courtly world, but when he's temporarily exiled and gets mixed up with a woman on the run, Kaurwaki (Kareena Kapoor), his love for her humanizes him--and Khan and Kapoor make a scorching pair. When Asoka is falsely told she's dead, he's shattered, marries another--a Buddhist named Devi (Hrishita Bhatt)--violently assumes the throne, and becomes even more brutal than before. The story is bolstered by striking art direction, tight editing, and fantastic performances by supporting actors.The lavish final battle scene--which included 6,000 extras--is refreshingly low-tech and all the more realistic as a result. The aftermath is gory and moving as Asoka searches among the corpses for his lost love. (According to historical records, Asoka was horrified by the magnitude of death he'd caused at the Battle of Kalinga, which prompted him to reform.)There are a couple of detracting elements that break the film's powerful spell. The use of comedy is a distraction rather than a relief. That's not an indictment of masala--Bollywood's traditional blending of genres--but in this case, it doesn't work. The drama is too captivating to downshift out of it. Also, the songs seem too contemporary for a historical pic.Finally, the film was criticized for its historical inaccuracies (Devi was actually Asoka's first wife; he married Kaurwaki later). The criticism is unfair to some degree given that it's necessary to take liberties with true stories in order to create a narrative arc, but since the film's explanation of Asoka's profound change doesn't jibe with the facts, his confounding transformation remains, unsatisfyingly, a mystery.- The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)",4,Worth Watching,1276646400,"06 16, 2010",2010,2845,"['When', 'monsters', 'become', 'monks', 'usually', 'stuff', 'legends', 'Asoka', 'bloodthirsty', 'emperor', 'who', 'later', 'renounced', 'violence', 'was', 'real', 'person', '2001', 'film', ""'Asoka"", 'early', 'life', 'captures', 'mesmerizing', 'fashion', 'how', 'such', 'unlikely', 'conversion', 'could', 'take', 'place.Asoka', 'was', 'favorite', 'grandson', 'Chandragupta', 'Maurya', 'emperor', 'kingdom', 'Magadha', 'third', 'century', 'BC', 'Chandragupta', 'beat', 'back', 'armies', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'conquered', 'most', 'Indian', 'subcontinent', 'then', 'adopted', 'Jain', 'religion', 'renounced', 'throne', 'died', 'fasting', 'empire', 'fell', 'son', 'Bindusara', 'apparent', 'was', 'Asoka', 'eldest', 'brother', 'Susima.And', 'where', 'film', 'trace', 'Asoka', 'who', 'would', 'one', 'day', 'convert', 'Buddhism', 'become', 'one', 'world', 'first', 'great', 'humanitarians', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'law', 'vast', 'land', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'young', 'Asoka', 'skilled', 'merciless', 'warrior', 'ruthless', 'political', 'ambition', 'role', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'Khan', 'intense', 'dramatic', 'style', 'always', 'antihero', 'Asoka', 'animal', 'kill-or-be-killed', 'courtly', 'world', 'when', 'temporarily', 'exiled', 'mixed', 'up', 'woman', 'run', 'Kaurwaki', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'love', 'humanizes', 'Khan', 'Kapoor', 'make', 'scorching', 'pair', 'When', 'Asoka', 'falsely', 'told', 'dead', 'shattered', 'Buddhist', 'named', 'Devi', 'Hrishita', 'Bhatt', 'violently', 'throne', 'even', 'more', 'brutal', 'before', 'story', 'bolstered', 'striking', 'art', 'direction', 'tight', 'editing', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'supporting', 'actors.The', 'lavish', 'final', 'battle', 'scene', 'included', '6,000', 'extras', 'refreshingly', 'low-tech', 'more', 'realistic', 'result', 'aftermath', 'gory', 'moving', 'Asoka', 'corpses', 'lost', 'love', 'According', 'historical', 'records', 'Asoka', 'was', 'horrified', 'magnitude', 'death', ""'d"", 'caused', 'Battle', 'Kalinga', 'prompted', 'reform', 'are', 'couple', 'detracting', 'elements', 'break', 'film', 'powerful', 'spell', 'use', 'comedy', 'distraction', 'rather', 'relief', 'not', 'indictment', 'masala', 'Bollywood', 'traditional', 'blending', 'genres', 'case', ""n't"", 'work', 'drama', 'too', 'captivating', 'downshift', 'Also', 'songs', 'seem', 'too', 'contemporary', 'historical', 'pic.Finally', 'film', 'was', 'criticized', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'Devi', 'was', 'actually', 'Asoka', 'first', 'wife', 'married', 'Kaurwaki', 'later', 'criticism', 'unfair', 'degree', 'given', 'necessary', 'take', 'liberties', 'true', 'stories', 'order', 'create', 'narrative', 'arc', 'film', 'explanation', 'Asoka', 'profound', 'change', ""n't"", 'jibe', 'facts', 'confounding', 'transformation', 'unsatisfyingly', 'mystery.-', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket', 'American', 'guide', 'Indian', 'movies', 'Subscribe', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket']",N/A

680746,AW3I97UR8NP7T,B00005RYLQ,"Karen Shaub ""Nickname:  Queen B""","[7, 7]","Are you up for something completely different, something the likes of which I guarantee you have never experienced before? A film that has the lush aura of Franco Zefferelli's Shakespearean films combined with the extavagent sets of Liz Taylor's CLEOPATRA mixed with the whimsy of Baz Luhrmann's MOULIN ROUGE?  You say no such animal exists? Well my friend, you are wrong!That film is ASOKA which stars the legendary Shah Rukh Khan who is undoubtedly the most worshipped romantic leading man in the world of cinema today--bar none. I was going to say that he was the most lusted after, which is probably true as well, but there is something about SRK, as he is known, that seems to evoke an even more powerful emotion in women than mere lust. He is Rudolph Valentino, Gene Kelly, and, when he needs to be, Douglas Fairbanks. He's all of those and more, he's an original. And he's a very important part of what makes this film work so well.There is so very much in this film to like aside from Khan that I hardly no where to begin. The cast is all superb, especially his co-star the incredibly beautiful Kareena Kapoor who plays Asoka's love interest the Princess Kaurwaki, she couldn't be more believable as the woman for whom he would gladly give up a throne. The sets and costumes and sets are gorgeous and whether or not they are true to the time period couldn't concern me less since the director's approach to this film seems to be more that of a romantic fantasy that of an historical documentary.That brings us to the one element that sets Bollywood pictures apart from Hollywood films, the musical numbers! (Remember I said SRK had a little Gene Kelly in him.) The fact that anyone can burst into song and dance for no apparent reason at any given moment is one of the things I like best about Bollywood movies. There is so much joy and exuberance in these numbers that sometimes I just want to get up and dance myself, but since I look nothing like those pretty girls with their bare midriffs I've managed to restrain myself, so far. I know what you're thinking, but really after you get accustomed to it the songs won't bother you at all. In fact you might even like them. They're sort of a combination of folk and pop, and they're very catchy. I've always liked ""foreign"" folk music so I fell right into it.But what about the story, you say. The story is mostly fiction based on fact. There was a man named Asoka who became a brutal monarch and then renounced his throne to spread the word of Buddha. He is in fact credited with having transformed Buddhism from a second-rate sect into a major world religion by sending forth missionaries. His personal life and his rise to power which are the subjects of this film,are the stuff of myth and legend. But that's always where the best stories are.The dvd begins with a crawl that fills us in a tiny bit on the importance of the the man in the story we are about to see which is very helpful for those of us without any background in Buddhism. And our story itself begins with Asoka's grandfather the Emperor Chandragupta Mauya giving away all his possessions to the people prior to embracing his new life as a Jainist monk. Asoka is just a young boy and doesn't understand his grandfather's choice, nor does he understand when his grandfather tries to stop Asoka from keeping his sword for himself. His grandfather tells him that the sword is a demon and that once it is drawn it sees neither friend nor foe it only thirsts for blood, and that he should throw it away before it can do anymore harm. Asoka refuses, so his grandfather grabs it from him and throws it in the river himself, then leaves on his journey with the other monks. If only Asoka had left the sword in the river, but he doesn't. If only he had not drawn it, but he does. If only he learned from that first bloody lesson, but he doesn't.There is plenty more to Asoka's story, the film runs well over 2 and 1/2 hours, but in that time it manages to pack in adventure, romance, comedy, drama, one really good battle scene and a couple of small skirmishes, plus song and dance numbers that run the gamut from free wheeling fun, to sensual and exotic desire. My God, how much more do you want from your first Bollywood experience!WHAT ARE YOU WAITING? FOR EVERY BLOCKBUSTERS HAS A COPY OF THIS MOVIE. GO RENT IT. Really.Oh, there is one tiny negative.

680752,AYZLXLVMJGTJV,B00005RYLQ,L. J Nary,"[2, 2]","The film shimmers in color and it seems you can see the sparks of electricity jump out from Asoka's eyes. I loved the color and cinematography. The dance sequences were upbeat with modern mixed with primitive style. The music was catchy and still had such a great Indian flavor. The two main actors were involving to watch. The movie has a Bollywood feel yet I think it is more contempary than some of the others I have seen. The film flashes with the music creating a unique picture. It sometimes reminds me of a music video. The actress who plays Kariwake has the most beautiful eyes and gives her character a spice and anger that makes her quite interesting.The movie is about a prince who wanted to sit on his fathers throne yet had to compete for this with his stepbrothers. Asoka was playful and could be seen as a big child yet he could be vindictive and cruel. He had a lust for blood as the movie had shown us at the beginning yet he had a grief and sadness after violence was inflicted. He was human and the film I think portrayed this.He ends up leaving his home on his mothers manipulation and trys to become an ordinary man. Yet his beauty and skill at swordplay and yoga moves set him out as something quite special. He falls for a beautiful young girl who I mentioned earlier. Karwaki is also royalty and is hiding from those that want her brother's throne. The romance sequences are rich with music, playful antics and color. The sex is left out for the imagination. They do not even kiss, which could be a bit dissappointing if you like to see this in a film. You can feel their hunger for one another yet it is not acted out.The film takes a dark turn after Asoka finds out that Karawaki has been murdered. His mother is murdered and thats when he explodes with anger and revenge. This part I found hard to sit through. I wanted the romance to continue and florish and it did not. It really never had a closure to me.

The breakouts into musical segments was a little different for me, and did not always flow into the plot very well, but the music videos were sensual and entertaining in their own right.

For that reason I wonder about how characteristic this film is of Bollywood film generally -- but that is I suppose an odd question: like seeing Star Wars or Jaws or The Titanic only and asking ""is this what all Hollywood films are like?""  But judging on this film alone there is a whole new world of film to explore, and I'm excited to take the leap.The story of the famous warrior king Asoka who became a Buddhist missionary for peace, it starts out beautifully, and one gets the sense this will be an epic film in the style of Hollywood epic melodrama.  Then, when he has left his homeland and gone wandering he catches the eye of a beautiful young woman, things change suddenly and one gets the sense this is nothing like a Hollywood film.  The vast scope of the film narrows and instead of lush and broad period backgrounds we get closeups of navels and hips, and it becomes a fiery dance number, with dance moves inspired by ancient Hindu love texts and diagrams (think Kamasutra style without sex: on the documentary included on this disc the choreographer said that diagrams from the Kamasutra as well as other early Hindu texts provided inspiration for some of the dance moves).  The epic story resumes quickly but is ""interrupted"" several times by bizarre but catchy and infectious dance and song numbers, that appear a peculiar hybrid between Broadway, MTV and  traditional dance.  After I got used to such scenes they grew on me and I found myself smiling and laughing in ways that I rarely do watching a Blockbuster Hollywood film.  Even though some (not all) of the dance/music scenes are erotically charged there is a remarkable innocence about them that hearkens back to early Hollywood musicals -- and I think my response to these numbers (partly due to the unexpected novelty) was close to what it must have been like to experience great Hollywood musicals as they emerged and not through the jaded eyes of a filmgoer whose experience is with films that have ""grown out"" of such styles.  In its epic mode, too, the film has a grandeur that is rarely approached in Hollywood epics today (and does not solicit the same kind of cynicism at least for me that seems an appropriate response to films like ""Alexander""), and comes perhaps closer to Kurosawa films like Ran.  Another connection to Kurosawa is in color -- though I think that where this film falls short of the Japanese master is in the editing which sometimes feels a bit too contrived (comparable at times to MTV style editing: cutting for a preconceived effect rather than cutting to create an organically seamless unity).",5,my first Bollywood experience -- and it won me over!!,1146614400,"05 3, 2006",2006,2891,"['did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'going', 'film', ""'m"", 'embarassed', 'say', 'even', 'teach', 'occasional', 'film', 'classes', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'true', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'only', 'read', 'knew', 'was', 'Bollywood', 'Blockbuster', 'one', 'only', 'few', 'had', 'wide', 'success', 'India', 'reason', 'wonder', 'how', 'characteristic', 'film', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'generally', 'suppose', 'odd', 'question', 'seeing', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Jaws', 'Titanic', 'only', 'asking', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'are', 'judging', 'film', 'alone', 'whole', 'new', 'world', 'film', 'explore', ""'m"", 'excited', 'take', 'leap.The', 'story', 'famous', 'warrior', 'king', 'Asoka', 'who', 'became', 'Buddhist', 'missionary', 'peace', 'out', 'beautifully', 'one', 'sense', 'will', 'be', 'epic', 'film', 'style', 'Hollywood', 'epic', 'melodrama', 'Then', 'when', 'left', 'homeland', 'gone', 'wandering', 'eye', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'things', 'change', 'suddenly', 'one', 'sense', 'nothing', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'vast', 'scope', 'film', 'narrows', 'instead', 'lush', 'broad', 'period', 'get', 'closeups', 'navels', 'hips', 'fiery', 'dance', 'number', 'dance', 'moves', 'inspired', 'ancient', 'Hindu', 'love', 'texts', 'diagrams', 'think', 'Kamasutra', 'style', 'sex', 'documentary', 'included', 'choreographer', 'said', 'diagrams', 'Kamasutra', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'early', 'Hindu', 'texts', 'provided', 'inspiration', 'dance', 'moves', 'epic', 'story', 'resumes', 'quickly', 'interrupted', 'several', 'times', 'bizarre', 'catchy', 'infectious', 'dance', 'song', 'numbers', 'appear', 'peculiar', 'hybrid', 'Broadway', 'MTV', 'traditional', 'dance', 'got', 'used', 'such', 'scenes', 'grew', 'found', 'smiling', 'laughing', 'ways', 'rarely', 'do', 'watching', 'Blockbuster', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'Even', 'not', 'dance/music', 'scenes', 'are', 'erotically', 'charged', 'remarkable', 'innocence', 'back', 'early', 'Hollywood', 'musicals', 'think', 'response', 'numbers', 'partly', 'due', 'unexpected', 'novelty', 'was', 'close', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'experience', 'great', 'Hollywood', 'musicals', 'emerged', 'not', 'jaded', 'eyes', 'filmgoer', 'experience', 'films', 'have', 'grown', 'out', 'such', 'styles', 'epic', 'mode', 'too', 'film', 'grandeur', 'rarely', 'approached', 'Hollywood', 'epics', 'today', 'not', 'solicit', 'same', 'kind', 'cynicism', 'least', 'appropriate', 'response', 'films', 'Alexander', 'perhaps', 'closer', 'Kurosawa', 'films', 'Ran', 'connection', 'Kurosawa', 'color', 'think', 'where', 'film', 'short', 'Japanese', 'master', 'editing', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'too', 'contrived', 'comparable', 'times', 'MTV', 'style', 'editing', 'cutting', 'preconceived', 'effect', 'rather', 'cutting', 'create', 'organically', 'seamless', 'unity']",N/A
680756,A3QVAKVRAH657N,B00005RYLQ,"Orrin C. Judd ""brothersjudddotcom""","[6, 8]","Unfortunately, this otherwise terrific movie ends just at the point where Asoka loses it all, which is actually when he became a truly important figure in world history.  Though the events of his life are somewhat sketchy, we know that Asoka was a great leader of India in the third century B.C.--he seems to have lived from about 299 to 232 B.C.  The grandson of the Mauryan Emperor Chandragupta, who was one of the earliest patrons of Buddhism, when Asoka took the throne he led a savage military campaign which eventually united much of India and even extended as far as Afghanistan.  But after the particularly brutal conquest of the state of Kalinga, Asoka was consumed by remorse and gave up his warrior ways, devoting himself instead to the spread of Buddhism, which he achieved by bringing some uniformity to Buddhist edicts, sending out missionaries across much of Asia, the Middle East, and even into North Africa, and by having Buddhist maxims inscribed on stones and pillars that were then placed along main routes of the kingdom and along its borders.  Though the Mauryan dynasty and the vast kingdom he had forged did not survive long after his death, Asoka is credited with transforming Buddhism from a secondary sect into one of the world's major religions.The appeal of such a story to a filmmaker is obvious, what with its combination of warfare and religious awakening.  Add in certain legends concerning his great love for the Princess Kaurwaki and you've got romance to add to the action and drama.  As if that's not enough, tack on the big musical numbers and the leisurely three hour pace that characterizes Bollywood and we're talking mega-epic.  Try to imagine Jerry Bruckheimer producing a collaboration between Baz Luhrmann and David Lean and you'll be nearly prepared to watch the movie.The movie is basically divided into three acts.  It opens with Asoka as a boy, watching his grandfather cast a great sword into a river.  Asoka asks him why he does such a thing and is told that it is a demon blade, which demands blood whenever it is drawn.  Asoka fishes it from the water and discovers, to his own horror, the truth of these words.  Having grown into a willful and violent young man, Asoka represents a threat to his stepbrothers in their quest for the thrown and they try repeatedly to have him murdered.  By threatening to take a vow of silence otherwise, Asoka's mother forces him to flee the capital and hide out, incognito, in the countryside.  It's there that he meets Kaurwaki, who, along with her princely younger brother, is likewise fleeing dynastic mayhem in Kalinga.  The young couple alternately woo and war with one another until the fates split them apart.  Whether because of this separation, which Asoka comes to believe must signal Kaurwaki's death, or because it is his nature, Asoka embarks on his fratricidal path to the throne and the horrific wars that won him a vast kingdom.  Eventually though, confrontations with a loyal retainer before the battle with Kalinga and with Kaurwaki and her brother after the battle show Asoka the misery he has wrought and the monster he has become.  A few scant lines of text tell us the rest of the story before the credits roll.Shahrukh Khan makes for a charismatic and soulful Asoka. Kareena Kapoor, daughter of one of India's great film families (I guess she'd be their Drew Barrymore?), is a captivating Kaurwaki.  Their tentative love affair consumes the long middle section of the film, before providing the tragic final impetus for Asoka's conversion.  It would seem to have made more dramatic sense to continue on with final act about Asoka's spiritual work, since that's what he's remembered for and since it would complete the arc of the film.  I guess though that the rather oppressive atmosphere of Hindu nationalism in India is such that it is somewhat risky to celebrate other religions in the way that this more natural storytelling would have entailed.The only other quarrel I have with the film is that, on video at least, it was a little bit washed out and the subtitles were white and nearly impossible to read against a light background.  Hopefully at some point the film will get the quality transfer that it warrants.GRADE : B",4,needs a sequel,1022976000,"06 2, 2002",2002,4240,"['Unfortunately', 'otherwise', 'terrific', 'movie', 'just', 'point', 'where', 'Asoka', 'actually', 'when', 'became', 'truly', 'important', 'figure', 'world', 'history', 'events', 'life', 'are', 'somewhat', 'sketchy', 'know', 'Asoka', 'was', 'great', 'leader', 'India', 'third', 'century', 'B.C.', 'have', 'lived', 'about', '299', '232', 'B.C', 'grandson', 'Mauryan', 'Emperor', 'Chandragupta', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'earliest', 'patrons', 'Buddhism', 'when', 'Asoka', 'took', 'throne', 'led', 'savage', 'military', 'campaign', 'eventually', 'united', 'much', 'India', 'even', 'extended', 'as', 'far', 'Afghanistan', 'particularly', 'brutal', 'conquest', 'state', 'Kalinga', 'Asoka', 'was', 'consumed', 'remorse', 'gave', 'up', 'warrior', 'ways', 'devoting', 'instead', 'spread', 'Buddhism', 'achieved', 'bringing', 'uniformity', 'Buddhist', 'edicts', 'sending', 'out', 'missionaries', 'much', 'Asia', 'Middle', 'East', 'even', 'North', 'Africa', 'having', 'Buddhist', 'maxims', 'inscribed', 'stones', 'pillars', 'were', 'then', 'placed', 'main', 'routes', 'kingdom', 'borders', 'Mauryan', 'dynasty', 'vast', 'kingdom', 'had', 'forged', 'did', 'not', 'survive', 'long', 'death', 'Asoka', 'credited', 'transforming', 'Buddhism', 'secondary', 'sect', 'one', 'world', 'major', 'religions.The', 'appeal', 'such', 'story', 'filmmaker', 'obvious', 'what', 'combination', 'warfare', 'religious', 'awakening', 'Add', 'certain', 'legends', 'concerning', 'great', 'love', 'Princess', 'Kaurwaki', ""'ve"", 'got', 'romance', 'add', 'action', 'drama', 'not', 'enough', 'tack', 'big', 'musical', 'numbers', 'leisurely', 'three', 'hour', 'pace', 'Bollywood', ""'re"", 'talking', 'mega-epic', 'Try', 'imagine', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'producing', 'collaboration', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'David', 'Lean', ""'ll"", 'be', 'nearly', 'prepared', 'watch', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'basically', 'divided', 'three', 'acts', 'Asoka', 'boy', 'watching', 'grandfather', 'cast', 'great', 'sword', 'river', 'Asoka', 'why', 'thing', 'told', 'demon', 'blade', 'blood', 'whenever', 'drawn', 'Asoka', 'water', 'discovers', 'own', 'horror', 'truth', 'words', 'Having', 'grown', 'willful', 'violent', 'young', 'man', 'Asoka', 'threat', 'stepbrothers', 'quest', 'thrown', 'try', 'repeatedly', 'have', 'murdered', 'threatening', 'take', 'vow', 'silence', 'otherwise', 'Asoka', 'mother', 'flee', 'capital', 'hide', 'out', 'incognito', 'countryside', 'there', 'Kaurwaki', 'who', 'princely', 'younger', 'brother', 'likewise', 'fleeing', 'dynastic', 'mayhem', 'Kalinga', 'young', 'couple', 'alternately', 'woo', 'war', 'one', 'fates', 'split', 'apart', 'Whether', 'separation', 'Asoka', 'believe', 'must', 'signal', 'Kaurwaki', 'death', 'nature', 'Asoka', 'fratricidal', 'path', 'throne', 'horrific', 'won', 'vast', 'kingdom', 'Eventually', 'confrontations', 'loyal', 'retainer', 'battle', 'Kalinga', 'Kaurwaki', 'brother', 'battle', 'show', 'Asoka', 'misery', 'wrought', 'monster', 'become', 'few', 'scant', 'lines', 'text', 'tell', 'rest', 'story', 'credits', 'roll.Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'charismatic', 'soulful', 'Asoka', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'daughter', 'one', 'India', 'great', 'film', 'families', 'guess', ""'d"", 'be', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'captivating', 'Kaurwaki', 'tentative', 'love', 'affair', 'long', 'middle', 'section', 'film', 'providing', 'tragic', 'final', 'impetus', 'Asoka', 'conversion', 'would', 'seem', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'dramatic', 'sense', 'continue', 'final', 'act', 'Asoka', 'spiritual', 'work', 'what', 'remembered', 'would', 'complete', 'arc', 'film', 'guess', 'rather', 'oppressive', 'atmosphere', 'Hindu', 'nationalism', 'India', 'such', 'somewhat', 'risky', 'celebrate', 'other', 'religions', 'way', 'more', 'natural', 'storytelling', 'would', 'have', 'entailed.The', 'only', 'other', 'quarrel', 'have', 'film', 'video', 'least', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'washed', 'out', 'subtitles', 'were', 'white', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'read', 'light', 'background', 'Hopefully', 'point', 'film', 'will', 'get', 'quality', 'transfer', 'B']",N/A
680757,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00005RYLQ,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[45, 51]","Asoka inspires mixed emotions. On the one hand, there are elements of pure beauty and love and then you have a contrast in the horrors of war. The cinematography is rich and awe-inspiring. I was literally mesmerized.This is not a romance in the sense of peace and love, this is a tragic tale of two hearts looking for one another amidst a world of betrayal and deceit. Not to mention a lust for power. The plot is complex and there are elements of revenge, cruelty and battles on a large scale.The intensity in the contrast is at times overwhelming. The action never seems to subside into a moment of peace. Either passion dances across the screen or horror and suspense surround the characters. The musical numbers give some relief from the intensity, yet they are also equally vibrant.This legendary story is recorded in a second century book called the ""Asokavadana."" The movie is based loosely on the story and at the end there is the implication of the renunciation of war.""Love wounds in a way that does not let you live or die.""It is emotional from the start and is dark in its lust for power and beautiful in its exotic swirling dance sequences. An almost mythological atmosphere pervades the film in places.The story begins when Asoka's grandfather tosses his sword into a waterfall because the sword hungers for blood. As his grandfather leaves, Asoka searches for the sword and finds it.When he is older his life is in danger. His mother, Dharma (Subhashini Ali), asks him to save his life by fleeing. After changing his name to Pawan, he meets Kaurwaki who is following a similar fate and is hiding out in the lush green countryside with her much younger brother Prince Arya.Prince Asoka/Pawan (Shah Rukh Khan) and the feisty and sensuous Princess Kaurwaki (Kareena Kapoor) imagine they have met before and Asoka calls her ""my warrior."" So romantic!The story then dives into a crystal pool of the most primal instincts. A man fighting for a woman, a warrior woman fighting for her land. Splashes of color spread out against a pastel blue sky. Swords become a part of the characters as they fight for their lives. There is a reward for finding Kaurwaki as she is the daughter of the king of Kalinga.When Asoka tells Kaurwaki:""I couldn't put a price on you. The earth doesn't have enough gold for that.""We know he is going to pay some terrible price for his love. They marry and just as soon as you think this story is going to move in a good direction, Asoka's mother calls him back and he is then sent off on a mission.""What is this surge of love?Do I drown to experience it?Can you tell what it is?Where could it lead?""On his return, he is told that his true love is dead. Once convinced, his aggressive nature emerges. He has no reason to live and desires only death. This loss of love seems to make him lust for power as he has lost the influence of Kaurwaki's love. He then ascends the throne of Magadha in the 3rd century BC. When he decides to extend the borders of his empire, he wages a bloody war on Kalinga, a neighboring kingdom.This review refers to a Widescreen edition. My only complaint was the extent of the violence in places and the subtitles were white and difficult to read at times. If you loved Lagaan, this movie is much more tragic.The story of Asoka's journey from war to peace.

The film runs the gamut of emotions from sheer joy to lust, violence, and stunning heartbreak.  It's an absolute tour-de-force from a country whose films are often the subject of parody and laughter in the West.  Nobody will parody this one.  ""Asoka"" is no joke and can easily be compared the China's wuxia classics.The central theme of this very long and involving story is the way love can transform you.  The title character is the classic Prince who leaves his land to seek adventure as a commoner after his arrogant ways lead to his own brothers attempting to have him assassinated.  While Asoka is the baddest warrior in the land (possibly due to the influence of a demonic sword), he is led to self-imposed exile when his beloved mother, fearing for his life, takes a vow of lifelong silence until he leaves.  Shortly upon embarking, he encounters a vision of spectacular beauty: a green-eyed girl singing and dancing as she bathes in a waterfall.  And I have to say, there are few actresses in the history of cinema more instantly desirable then Kareena Kapoordebarking.  She puts on a hell of a show for the young prince (and the viewer) and upon meeting her peeper, quickly departs after a somehow charming threat of violence.  Naturally, the headstrong warrior is only more intrigued.  So begins his REAL journey.One of the first things that struck me about ""Asoka"" was the low production values in the early scenes.  I'm hardly a film snob, but I'm just not used to a 2001 film that looks like a 1960's chop-socky flick.  Thankfully, I like me some chop-socky.  Quickly overlooked and forgotten as the quality seems to spike later.  More disconcerting however, is the occasionally shoddy recording of the voices for the musical numbers.  One likes for the film to maintain the illusion of the characters actually singing, but that's hard to do when the vocals occasionally sound like somebody held a tape recorder up to a vocalist's mouth to record the parts.  Bad news in a musical.  Thankfully, this is anything but an average song-and-dance affair and low-budget does not mean low-quality.The musical scenes flow very well with the story most of the time.  Occasionally, there are random performances in bars or in the streets just for the fun of it to break up the action a little, but at least one does a great job of advancing the lead characters' relationship, which is great.  A few are completely unnecessary and one resembles a bad Latin pop video, but most are very enjoyable provided you are not dead inside and are still able to find some joy in life.  You'll walk away from this film with some catchy tunes in your head for sure.  And don't worry; there's bloodshed to offset all the hip-swaying, scatting, and sitars.  ""Asoka"" boasts some very nice action scenes.  Leading man Shahrukh Khan brings the noise when it's time to step up the cool factor.  The bit that impressed me the most involved a long flexible blade that he wielded as a whip. That is just sweet.  Another early scene where an assassin tries to take him down as he bathes in the river is made entirely out of bada$z.  While the middle of the film focuses entirely on romance, in the end Asoka returns to the battlefield with a vengeance and inflicts much harm in some large-scale battles that portray the horrors of war.  Seeing a man collapse in despair on a pile of severed limbs, corpses, and blood covering the ground is just the kind of image that strikes right to the core of the matter.  And when it comes down to it, the film pulls no punches.  The final act is overflowing with bitter irony and tragedy of the worst kind.As I said, the theme of ""Asoka"" is love's ability to change us from the inside.  It strikes at the very core of our being and few who have experience it can deny this.  Seeing love transform the arrogant, ambitious, violent prince first into a smiling happy-go-lucky boy who wants nothing more then peace, then into a brutal tyrant who cares for nothing, and finally a Buddhist legend -all over the woman he loves- is just amazing.  The story is a work of art and unassailable.  I always enjoy a peep into an exotic culture as well.  In this case, I spent time pondering India's must-vaunted sensuality.  The clothing is often exceptionally skimpy, the ladies sway their hips in the most provocative ways, lovers caress each other, the lyrics are suggestive, one song's verses are punctuated by a teasingly breathy rhythmic sigh,  and the music itself has a sexually inviting aura to it.  And yet there is no kissing and certainly no actual love scene to be found in spite of the fact that so much of the film is focused on desire and sexual tension.  This is largely due to the conservative values of India and the fact that intimate displays of affection including kissing are viewed as indecent.  That's right; the culture that brought us the Kama Sutra is uptight about kissing.  Watch for it in this one.  Sexual thoughts and feelings pervade nearly every scene, but that tension is never released.  In Western cinema, that is nearly unheard of.  In India, it's practically the law.  Other cultures are truly fascinating.Pointless observations aside, ""Asoka"" is an absolute must for fans of epic Asian cinema.  Even Western film fans should give it a try.  You never know, you might like it.  There's an whole world of film outside of America and more often then not, it kicks our tail.  This was the first Bollywood flick I've seen and it's unlikely to be the last.  In spite of the epic length, the story is pretty well paced and the platter of entertainment it serves has something for everybody.  There's some classic comedy, killer action, despair and heartbreak, romance for miles, sexiness for days, endearing characters, and a brilliant message.  ""Asoka"" is a great film by most any standard and you oughtta give it a shot.4 1/2 stars rounded down for low-quality vocal recordings on high-quality musical numbers.",4,A warrior's

Although it didn't have the financial success it deserved, the movie is completely watchable, a love story set amongst beautiful scenery and historical settings.The beginning of Asoka is exciting and adventurous, with Asoka battling numerous adversaries (including his brothers) against a backdrop of temples, castles, and rivers. Asoka then is exiled and leaves the kingdom. He meets the princess Kaurwaki and adopts the guise of a commoner. Here, the story turns into one of romance. There is the obligatory dancing. This is sufficient ""down time"" before the movie once again picks up the pace, driving straight into more rousing battle scenes.Kareena Kapoor does a good job as the princess Kaurwaki. She manages to be commanding, tough, and sensual all at once. I must also commend Shahrukh Khan's performance - he deviates greatly from the other roles he has portrayed in previous movies. The thing that stops me from giving this film 5/5 stars is the seemingly random song/dance numbers. They seem completely unrelated to the mood of the movie, and they could definitely go into the trash.Overall, Asoka is great.
