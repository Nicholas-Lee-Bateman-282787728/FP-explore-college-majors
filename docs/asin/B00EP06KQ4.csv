1668418,A1HPBQ7G7WYJVU,B00EP06KQ4,Polo Grande,"[0, 0]","Very funny, albeit predictable ""road movie"" that showcases some wonderful chemistry between Rogan and Streisand.  Some great gags and lines, priceless reaction shots, and a borderline believable premise has Rogan setting out on a last ditch sales trip with his prototypical ""Jewish mother"" tagging along and listening to R-rated talking books in the process.  The Guilt Trip does an admirable job of balancing the main road movie premise with events that unfold along the trip (strange hitchhikers, strippers, drunks, rich meat eating cowboys, failed product pitches).The core of The Guilt Trip is a sweetness of tone, with both characters equally at each others' throats, then taking a deep breath and realizing that familial love is stronger than transient pain.  The moments of revelation between the two seem genuine and unforced, and in some case almost ad-libbed.Streisand's ""Joyce"" occasionally becomes cartoonish and mannered, and Rogan plays the same character he's played in a dozen films- with a few welcome, subtle shadings.  He shows some promise of having the ability to ""underact"" if necessary.A funny and endearing mother-son movie.",4,Fun Trip,1405641600,"07 18, 2014",2014,1148,"['Very', 'funny', 'predictable', 'road', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'Rogan', 'Streisand', 'great', 'gags', 'lines', 'priceless', 'reaction', 'shots', 'borderline', 'believable', 'premise', 'Rogan', 'setting', 'out', 'last', 'ditch', 'sales', 'trip', 'prototypical', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'tagging', 'along', 'listening', 'R-rated', 'talking', 'books', 'process', 'Guilt', 'Trip', 'admirable', 'job', 'balancing', 'main', 'road', 'movie', 'premise', 'events', 'unfold', 'trip', 'strange', 'hitchhikers', 'strippers', 'drunks', 'rich', 'meat', 'eating', 'cowboys', 'failed', 'product', 'pitches', '.The', 'core', 'Guilt', 'Trip', 'sweetness', 'tone', 'characters', 'equally', 'others', 'throats', 'then', 'taking', 'deep', 'breath', 'realizing', 'familial', 'love', 'stronger', 'transient', 'pain', 'moments', 'revelation', 'two', 'seem', 'genuine', 'unforced', 'case', 'almost', 'ad-libbed.Streisand', 'Joyce', 'occasionally', 'cartoonish', 'mannered', 'Rogan', 'same', 'character', 'played', 'dozen', 'films-', 'few', 'welcome', 'subtle', 'shadings', 'promise', 'having', 'ability', 'underact', 'necessary.A', 'funny', 'endearing', 'mother-son', 'movie']",N/A

One would think that it would be a dull movie but the Humor is there and makes the entire film work very well. Streisand and Rogen work very well together in this film and makes the whole thing a good Family friendly movie that just skirts in the adult territory with scenes and topics. Still it pulls off as a very well done film across the board. Well worth watching once in a while.
