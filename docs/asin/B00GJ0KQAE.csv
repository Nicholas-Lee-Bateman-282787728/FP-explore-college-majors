1678514,A4KWEJ17QCZQK,B00GJ0KQAE,"Joshua M. ""Joshua""","[3, 3]","I have to say that writer/director Shane O'Sullivan is quite a brilliant and very talented artist. It shows very early in this film in the way he mixes his information, interviews and wonderfully haunting recreations of Oswald. The actor portraying Lee Harvey Oswald neither looks nor sounds like the real Oswald. And to me that's brilliant in the way Mr. O'Sullivan sets it up with the same basic background. I don't think there are many other filmmakers working today that could pull that off as effectively as Shane O'Sullivan does in KILLING OSWALD. My hat's off to the director here as he paints a haunting picture of the reality of JFK & Oswald's deaths. Lee is innocent and Kennedy in a sense was not so different from Lee. Their political positions basically the same despite their different class positions in society. Thanks for the film Mr. O'Sullivan! I hope to see more from you! You are providing a great service to humanity and to the memories of Jack and Bobby Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald and the pursuit of justice & truth. For that, we can never do enough to repay you.

1678515,A2CA2Q6JS6CQAE,B00GJ0KQAE,"Michael Harris ""Michael Harris""","[1, 2]","This is a very interesting film.  There is a short bit of film of the FBI's recreation of the hiding of the rifle and running down the stairs.  My question is,  why is that short piece of film sped up?  I have to assume the makers of Killing Oswald used the film as is; from the archives I suppose.  So did the FBI speed the film up to cut the time it would have taken to hide the rifle and get downstairs because Oswald was stopped in the 2nd floor lunch room about 90 secs after the shooting.  Did the FBI speed up that bit of &#34;recreation&#34; to &#34;make sure&#34; Oswald would have time to get downstairs.It's only that short bit of black & white footage that is sped up, the rest of the film is very well done & if that film was acquired in it's fast speed,  I certainly appreciate Shane O'Sullivan keeping the footage at the speed they received it in.  It sticks out like a sore thumb to me, but if you didn't notice it (I didn't the first time I watched this documentry),  it's worth re-watching",5,Killing Oswald makes me wonder....,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,1007,"['very', 'interesting', 'film', 'short', 'bit', 'film', 'FBI', 'recreation', 'hiding', 'rifle', 'running', 'down', 'stairs', 'question', 'why', 'short', 'piece', 'film', 'sped', 'up', 'have', 'assume', 'makers', 'Killing', 'Oswald', 'used', 'film', 'archives', 'suppose', 'So', 'did', 'FBI', 'speed', 'film', 'up', 'cut', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'hide', 'rifle', 'get', 'downstairs', 'Oswald', 'was', 'stopped', '2nd', 'floor', 'lunch', 'room', '90', 'secs', 'shooting', 'Did', 'FBI', 'speed', 'up', 'bit', '34', 'recreation', '34', '34', 'make', 'sure', '34', 'Oswald', 'would', 'have', 'time', 'get', 'downstairs.It', 'only', 'short', 'bit', 'black', 'white', 'footage', 'sped', 'up', 'rest', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'was', 'acquired', 'fast', 'speed', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'Shane', ""O'Sullivan"", 'keeping', 'footage', 'speed', 'received', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'did', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'documentry', 'worth', 're-watching']",Killing Oswald
1678516,A1WFTEJFRBV0LE,B00GJ0KQAE,Norma Desmond,"[32, 34]","This is an excellent film, except for one glaring mistake.  Near the beginning of the film, Lee Oswald is referred to as President Kennedy's &#34;convicted killer.&#34;  I would remind the film-maker that Oswald never had a trial, and in fact, repeatedly requested legal assistance and never got any.  I will quote one witty journalist:  &#34;Lee Oswald miraculously managed to survive nearly 48 hours in the custody of the Dallas Police Department.&#34;I would recommend this for people who are at least moderately interested in the Kennedy assassination.  I do think the casual observer might not find it all that compelling.

1678518,A2P4W7YS7RKHUN,B00GJ0KQAE,TLR,"[16, 17]","This is a very strong, though not perfect, two-hour collection. It collects just about every bit of film footage we have of Oswald (except for some color film of him on a New Orleans street which surfaced in the last few years), and excerpts from the New Orleans radio interview. It demonstrates what an intelligent and articulate young man Oswald was, going against the official stereotype of him as an uneducated nobody.There is a bit too much reliance on David Kaiser, who believes that Oswald killed JFK and that the ""backyard photos"" are genuine. Russell discusses the Richard Case Nagell story and Newman talks about Mexico City. Veciana tells about seeing Oswald meeting with an agent he knew as Maurice Bishop in Dallas. A caption reveals that Veciana recently disclosed that ""Bishop"" was CIA officer David Atlee Phillips. Also included is a brief color clip of Phillips at Win Scott's wedding in December 1962.The Sylvia Odio and Mexico City incidents are examined from different angles.There is an old interview (looks like late 1960s) with Loran Hall that I'd never seen before where he talks about being briefly jailed in Dallas before the assassination. I was amazed that he doesn't have the slightest trace of a Cuban accent. He sounds like he's from California. An excerpt from a phone interview from the late 70s is misused by Kaiser to link Hall and Santo Trafficante to the assassination. However, during his testimony to the HSCA in 1977, Hall makes it clear that he is referring to the Bayo-Pawley raid rather than the killing of Kennedy.There is vintage footage of an Allen Dulles interview in 1965, and a 1968 George de Mohrenschildt interview. He is asked whether Oswald was a friend or an enemy of President Kennedy. De Mohrenschildt replies, ""He definitely was not an enemy. He was an admirer of President Kennedy. From his point of view, he was an excellent President and his ideas corresponded very well with President Kennedy's ideas and vice versa."" At one point he refers to him as ""Harvey Lee Oswald,"" as so many people did (government documents before the assassination, Clay Shaw, even Robert Kennedy). De Mohrenschildt laughs at the government's idea that a lunatic killed a lunatic who killed the President, and now another lunatic (Jim Garrison) is reopening the investigation - are there really so many lunatics in America?There is also 1964 film footage of a Ruth Paine interview. As with all her interviews, they reveal (like Oswald) a serious, disciplined, intelligent person who stays on message. I'd never seen the film of Gen. Walker being interviewed right after the ""assassination attempt,"" and he appears to be almost smirking as he describes it.There are many samples of Oswald's writings, his evolving political views, his rejection of capitalism, communism and socialism, and his attempts to find another social-democratic alternative. He talks about the possibility of a military coup overthrowing the US government, possibly being organized by the Marines. Oswald also talked about how much Russia and the US needed to work out their differences ""because our two countries have too much to offer each other than to be tearing at each other's throats in an endless Cold War.""Since this is a documentary about Oswald, there is a bit too much footage of Jack (and Jackie in Spanish) talking hawkishly about Cuba from the 1960 campaign, without any discussion of the back-channel talks JFK was having with Castro in late 1963 about normalizing relations with Cuba. There is only a brief mention of JFK's tensions with the military leadership (some clips from the film Seven Days in May and discussion of Gen. Edwin Walker are included - no mention of Generals Lemnitzer and LeMay, Admiral Anderson and SAC Commander Thomas Power).",5,Four and a half stars,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,3777,"['very', 'strong', 'not', 'perfect', 'two-hour', 'collection', 'just', 'about', 'bit', 'film', 'footage', 'have', 'Oswald', 'color', 'film', 'New', 'Orleans', 'street', 'surfaced', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'excerpts', 'New', 'Orleans', 'radio', 'interview', 'what', 'intelligent', 'articulate', 'young', 'man', 'Oswald', 'was', 'going', 'official', 'stereotype', 'uneducated', 'nobody.There', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'reliance', 'David', 'Kaiser', 'who', 'Oswald', 'killed', 'JFK', 'backyard', 'photos', 'are', 'genuine', 'Russell', 'Richard', 'Case', 'Nagell', 'story', 'Newman', 'talks', 'Mexico', 'City', 'Veciana', 'seeing', 'Oswald', 'meeting', 'agent', 'knew', 'Maurice', 'Bishop', 'Dallas', 'caption', 'Veciana', 'recently', 'disclosed', 'Bishop', 'was', 'CIA', 'officer', 'David', 'Atlee', 'Phillips', 'Also', 'included', 'brief', 'color', 'clip', 'Phillips', 'Win', 'Scott', 'wedding', 'December', '1962.The', 'Sylvia', 'Odio', 'Mexico', 'City', 'incidents', 'are', 'examined', 'different', 'old', 'interview', 'late', '1960s', 'Loran', 'Hall', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'where', 'being', 'briefly', 'jailed', 'Dallas', 'assassination', 'was', 'amazed', ""n't"", 'have', 'slightest', 'trace', 'Cuban', 'accent', 'California', 'excerpt', 'phone', 'interview', 'late', '70s', 'misused', 'Kaiser', 'link', 'Hall', 'Santo', 'Trafficante', 'assassination', 'However', 'testimony', 'HSCA', '1977', 'Hall', 'clear', 'referring', 'Bayo-Pawley', 'raid', 'rather', 'killing', 'Kennedy.There', 'vintage', 'footage', 'Allen', 'Dulles', 'interview', '1965', '1968', 'George', 'de', 'Mohrenschildt', 'interview', 'asked', 'Oswald', 'was', 'friend', 'enemy', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'De', 'Mohrenschildt', 'replies', 'definitely', 'was', 'not', 'enemy', 'was', 'admirer', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'point', 'view', 'was', 'excellent', 'President', 'ideas', 'corresponded', 'very', 'well', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'ideas', 'vice', 'versa', 'one', 'point', 'Harvey', 'Lee', 'Oswald', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'did', 'government', 'documents', 'assassination', 'Clay', 'Shaw', 'even', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'De', 'Mohrenschildt', 'government', 'idea', 'lunatic', 'killed', 'lunatic', 'who', 'killed', 'President', 'now', 'lunatic', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'reopening', 'investigation', 'are', 'there', 'really', 'so', 'many', 'lunatics', 'America', 'also', '1964', 'film', 'footage', 'Ruth', 'Paine', 'interview', 'interviews', 'reveal', 'Oswald', 'serious', 'disciplined', 'intelligent', 'person', 'who', 'message', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'Gen.', 'Walker', 'being', 'interviewed', 'right', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'be', 'almost', 'smirking', 'are', 'many', 'samples', 'Oswald', 'writings', 'evolving', 'political', 'views', 'rejection', 'capitalism', 'communism', 'socialism', 'attempts', 'find', 'social-democratic', 'alternative', 'possibility', 'military', 'coup', 'overthrowing', 'US', 'government', 'possibly', 'being', 'organized', 'Marines', 'Oswald', 'also', 'talked', 'how', 'much', 'Russia', 'US', 'needed', 'work', 'out', 'differences', 'two', 'countries', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'offer', 'other', 'be', 'tearing', 'other', 'throats', 'endless', 'Cold', 'War', 'documentary', 'Oswald', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'footage', 'Jack', 'Jackie', 'Spanish', 'talking', 'hawkishly', 'Cuba', '1960', 'campaign', 'discussion', 'back-channel', 'talks', 'JFK', 'was', 'having', 'Castro', 'late', '1963', 'normalizing', 'relations', 'Cuba', 'only', 'brief', 'mention', 'JFK', 'tensions', 'military', 'leadership', 'clips', 'film', 'Seven', 'Days', 'May', 'discussion', 'Gen.', 'Edwin', 'Walker', 'are', 'included', 'mention', 'Generals', 'Lemnitzer', 'LeMay', 'Admiral', 'Anderson', 'SAC', 'Commander', 'Thomas', 'Power']",Killing Oswald
