397277,A3TRZPS9Q7RLON,6304039212,"Dan Allen ""the canon""","[0, 0]","Wayne Wang's sequel to Smoke is equal to if not better than Smoke. Heard this one is more improvised and looser than Smoke. It has a great cast including Lou Reed(with a pair of cool glasses), Michael J. Fox, of course Harvey Keitel and Rosanne! This is a great little gem, with some moments of laughter, and a nice portrait of an ever-changing Brooklyn and its characters. Very much in the tradition of Jarmusch, maybe a little more comedy-based, but well done none the less. Blue in the Face is fun, and one to come back to once in a while. Pretty cool soundtrack too. Caution if you are an ex-smoker though, ha.Blue in the Face",4,The Brooklynytes,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,630,"['Wayne', 'Wang', 'sequel', 'Smoke', 'equal', 'not', 'better', 'Smoke', 'Heard', 'one', 'more', 'improvised', 'looser', 'Smoke', 'great', 'cast', 'including', 'Lou', 'Reed', 'pair', 'cool', 'glasses', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'course', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Rosanne', 'great', 'little', 'gem', 'moments', 'laughter', 'nice', 'portrait', 'ever-changing', 'Brooklyn', 'characters', 'Very', 'much', 'tradition', 'Jarmusch', 'maybe', 'little', 'more', 'comedy-based', 'well', 'done', 'none', 'less', 'Blue', 'Face', 'fun', 'one', 'come', 'back', 'once', 'while', 'Pretty', 'cool', 'soundtrack', 'too', 'Caution', 'are', 'ex-smoker', 'though', 'ha.Blue', 'Face']",Blue in the Face VHS
397278,A398FD7XNE6ISZ,6304039212,Dave Beards,"[10, 12]","'Blue In The Face' chronicles a snapshot of life in Brooklyn NY. At the centre of this life is a cigar store that is frequented by a parade of weird and wonderful people. So that is it - there is no story line, or indeed it appears there is no script - just a series of 'situations' designed to be a wonderful showcase for the actors involved.And what a cast of actors!!! Memorable performances by Lou Reed, Michael J. Fox, Madonna, Roseanne and a host of others make this movie a must see. They don't appear to have to operate within the confines of a script so their full ad-lib abilities shine. At the centre of the action is Harvey Keitel who gives a wonderful performance as the laid back cigar store worker.Another fascinating angle to this movie is the inclusion of real Brooklyn residents describing Brooklyn and their lives. Even though the unstructured aspect of the movie makes for no story lines, it does seem as though it is a homage to Brooklyn and its residents.The picture quality on this DVD is outstanding. Perhaps a little too soft in places, but otherwise it is hard to fault. No special features are included which is a shame. It would have been great to have interviews with the cast to hear their thoughts on the movie.'Blue In The Face' is a bizarre movie, but with it featuring some very well known faces in roles they have not been seen in before, made Blue in the face riveting viewing for me.",4,Interesting diversion from the Hollywood norm....,1056758400,"06 28, 2003",2003,1420,"[""'Blue"", 'Face', 'chronicles', 'snapshot', 'life', 'Brooklyn', 'NY', 'centre', 'life', 'cigar', 'store', 'frequented', 'parade', 'weird', 'wonderful', 'people', 'story', 'line', 'indeed', 'script', 'just', 'series', ""'situations"", 'designed', 'be', 'wonderful', 'showcase', 'actors', 'involved.And', 'what', 'cast', 'actors', 'Memorable', 'performances', 'Lou', 'Reed', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'Madonna', 'Roseanne', 'host', 'others', 'make', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'operate', 'confines', 'script', 'so', 'full', 'ad-lib', 'abilities', 'shine', 'centre', 'action', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'who', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'laid', 'back', 'cigar', 'store', 'worker.Another', 'fascinating', 'angle', 'movie', 'inclusion', 'real', 'Brooklyn', 'residents', 'describing', 'Brooklyn', 'lives', 'Even', 'unstructured', 'aspect', 'movie', 'story', 'lines', 'seem', 'homage', 'Brooklyn', 'residents.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVD', 'outstanding', 'Perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'soft', 'places', 'hard', 'fault', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'included', 'shame', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'have', 'interviews', 'cast', 'hear', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'Face', 'bizarre', 'movie', 'featuring', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'roles', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'seen', 'before', 'made', 'Blue', 'face', 'riveting', 'viewing']",Blue in the Face VHS

Harvey Keitel is great, I don't think I've ever seen him in a bad film. But many charachters, such as the one played by Michael J. Fox, are only seen for a few brief minutes. There is no narrative, this movie is shameful compared to it's predecessor. I understand the directors wanted too do an ode to Brooklyn, but why, oh why, did they have to do it around a sequel to smoke?",2,What a shame!!!,1028505600,"08 5, 2002",2002,462,"['What', 'waste', 'terribly', 'filmed', 'aimless', 'also', 'shoddy', 'editing', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'bad', 'film', 'many', 'charachters', 'such', 'one', 'played', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'are', 'only', 'seen', 'few', 'brief', 'minutes', 'narrative', 'movie', 'shameful', 'compared', 'predecessor', 'understand', 'directors', 'wanted', 'too', 'do', 'ode', 'Brooklyn', 'why', 'oh', 'why', 'did', 'have', 'do', 'around', 'sequel', 'smoke']",Blue in the Face VHS
