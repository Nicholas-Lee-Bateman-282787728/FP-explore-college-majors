1175475,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001CC7PLM,Chris Pandolfi,"[36, 39]","""Deception"" is to the thriller genre what a pulp detective novel is to literature: it's a guilty pleasure that satisfies, even though something better is always an option. I never believed that this story was in any way, shape, or form possible, but I certainly had fun watching it. As the title suggests, many of the characters are intentionally giving off the wrong impression, and by the time we discover their true natures, something new is revealed. This isn't to say that the film is overloaded with plot twists; the mystery eventually comes to an end with little confusion, and that's good for anyone who actually wants to follow along with the details. I will say that I was concerned entering the theater, because let's face it--a title like ""Deception"" makes one wonder just how far it will go to fool the audience.We're immediately introduced to Jonathan McQuarry (Ewan McGregor), a timid accountant for some unnamed firm in New York City. While working late, he meets Wyatt Bose (Hugh Jackman), an extremely charismatic attorney. He instantaneously gets on McQuarry's good side, first by sharing a joint with him, second by involving him in activities he would never be a part of. They become friends, but it's obvious that something sinister is lurking behind Bose's devilish smile. McQuarry begins to discover this when the two accidentally switch cell phones during a lunch meeting--while Bose is supposedly on a London business trip, McQuarry keeps getting phone calls from women who ask if he's available, believing he's Bose. Feeling emboldened, McQuarry decides to take one of the women up on her offer and meet at a hotel.And that's when he discovers that Bose is part of a sex club that caters to people interested in one-night stands. McQuarry eventually meets a Wall Street belle (Charlotte Rampling) who states the two basic rules: no rough stuff, and no names. In this seemingly harmless world of casual sex, McQuarry eventually meets a woman known only as S (Michelle Williams). Both are initially uncomfortable because they realize they had met before in a subway station. To alleviate the tension, they break the rules and actually strike up long-winded conversations. They also go on dinner dates from time to time. What they don't do is share their real names. However, McQuarry seems to think that a romance is developing, so it seems likely that all such missing pieces will eventually fall into place.Then again, maybe they won't. When both stay in a Chinatown hotel, McQuarry returns to his room only to be knocked unconscious by a masked assailant, just as he notices that the bed sheets are stained with blood. He comes to hours later--not only are the bed sheets perfectly clean, S is nowhere to be found. It would seem that McQuarry has unknowingly been drawn into something much bigger than he thought, and what's worse, it has everything to do with Wyatt Bose. I won't reveal who he really is, what he plans to do, why he wants to do it, how he involves McQuarry, and what has happened to S, but rest assured that it's all about as sinister as you expect it to be, and no more. At a certain point, McQuarry accuses Bose of being a liar: ""Those weren't lies,"" Bose says maliciously. ""That was foreplay."" I can't quote the rest of that line for censorship reasons, but believe me when I say that the next bit of dialogue was oddly satisfying.The same can be said for the movie as a whole, even if the story is less believable than Michelle William's bleach blonde hair. I found myself caught up in the suspense, the way it slowly built itself before going right to light speed at the start of the third act. McQuarry is much more resourceful at that point, which is expected not only because his life is in jeopardy, but also because he begins the film as a mousy nobody. Then again, I'm not entirely sure he changes by the end of the movie--his love for S is motivating him more than anything else, which is odd considering he little he knows about her, least of all her name. Following her so blindly just doesn't seem logical. But I don't think logic is what the filmmakers were aiming for. ""Deception"" is a good old-fashioned mystery, adhering strictly to a formula of pure entertainment; chances are you'll find the plot twists more interesting than the coherence of the story.The same can be said for the performances, which are only as good as this film allows them to be. Jackman isn't much of a surprise here, since his role doesn't call for anything grander than being a villain. McGregor, on the other hand, reveals a refreshing new side to his personality. Being small and meek is a lot harder to pull off than being the tough guy--you need to be shy and vulnerable while making it look like you're desperate to prove something. I sensed that from his character and appreciated it, despite the fact that the story didn't always support it. But since I didn't expect anything more or less than what was delivered, I guess it's okay. I got my money's worth from ""Deception,"" and you will too as long as you're able to suspend disbelief and go with the flow. It's like being a client in an underground sex club--everyone can go home happy as long as no questions are asked.",4,"Sex, Lies, and Accounting",1209081600,"04 25, 2008",2008,5220,"['Deception',

1175483,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001CC7PLM,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","DECEPTION (2008) is one of those films that fares better after the brouhaha surrounding its release has dies down: catching for free on television probably adds to the positive response if the viewer has never even heard of the film!  So, in that vein, DECEPTION is a smooth thriller populated by a fine cast of actors who manage to keep the audience with them as the various aspects of this maze of a film at first confuse and then satisfy.  Writer Mark Bomback impresses and director Marcel Langenegger shows promise, but it is the work of the three main characters, with some VERY strong support form fine actors in cameo roles, that makes this thriller tick.Jonathan McQuarry (Ewan McGregor) is an accountant whose world needs to be precisely organized - and boring - and excludes any form of diversion or unexpected excitement.  Until handsome and debonair 'lawyer' Wyatt Bose (Hugh Jackman) appears on the scene.  The two strike up a strange 'guy-thing' relationship: Bose introduces McQuarry to tokes and women and then accidentally exchanges cellphones with the spaced out McQuarry.  Probably for the first time in his life McQuarry notices a young lady (Michelle Williams) in the subway and without an exchange of more than a few words of direction he becomes obsessed with her.  Meanwhile  Bose is off to London, leaving McQuarry to discover the cellphone connection to a sex club: call a number, ask if they are busy, meet them,  and have a wholly anonymous liaison - following the strict rules of the club.  McQuarry responds to some of these calls and discovers a world that includes such beauties as Charlotte Rampling, Natasha Henstridge, Paz de la Huerta, Maggie Q...and incidentally, 'S' - the moniker assumed by Michelle Williams.  McQuarry and 'S' connect on a higher level and it is at this point that Bose returns and the deceptive scheme for 'altering auditor books' to shift millions to Bose is presented to McQuarry as the only way he will see 'S' again.  From then on nothing is as it seems, entanglements become knots, bad things happen, and the only saving grace is the manner the film ends just shy of the happy-wappy manner....until the final frames betray the taste of the movie.DECEPTION is not a great film, but it is a good diversion as a thriller that keeps you thinking.  McGregor, Jackman, Williams et al (especially a cameo detective performance by Lisa Gay Hamilton) give fine performances - and that alone is refreshing enough to stay with the movie to the end.

It's Spike the Bulldog and Chester the Terrier, ""Hey Spike, what do you want to do today!?""  After some reefer, some tennis, and a bit of friendly banter, Wyatt not only gets Jonathan to admit to only having bedded four women in his lifetime, but also that rich women who are busy and horny are easy for simply those two reasons.

It sounds great until the immortal words of The Notorious B.I.G. are remembered,Mo Money Mo Problems.  Too true, player, too true.

1175495,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B001CC7PLM,magellan,"[2, 2]","Please note that I saw this on HBO so I can't comment on the quality of the video transfer or its features.Deception has some good points--mainly the excellent cast--and some decent acting. But the plot is, as other writers here have noted, so full of holes that you could drive  a truck through them. But if you ignore that, and concentrate on the development of the main characters, none of whom are what they seem to be on the surface, and which is gradually revealed during the course of the movie, there is some tension and drama from that as the movie unfolds and you discover their true nature. The idea of an exclusive, casual sex club in New York City where people use fictional names to hide their true identities, is sort of interesting, and a key relationship in the movie gets developed because of that when they break the club's rules of anonymity. The details of the international banking and money transfers were also sort of interesting, and the movie has an unexpected twist of an ending. The sex club idea reminded me of the infamous Plato's Retreat decades ago in New York City--I wonder if anyone still remembers that?I also want to mention that the movie has Charlotte Rampling in a supporting role, who I haven't seen in many years. The last time I recall seeing her was in the sci-fi/fantasy movie Zardoz from the mid-80s where she played opposite Sean Connery.

I was forced, in a matter of speaking, to watch the movie, with the hope that I could talk later to a manager at the store who ""possessed"" the skills to void extra charges.I tried to put my frustration aside and be an open minded viewer. The beginning of the movie was such a clich&eacute; for every man's dream coming true (i.e getting lucky and have a friend who would enable him to have one night stands with pretty women, who he never met before). Thrilled by this new life and the anticipation of his next bed partner, he finds that there's only one woman (of the sex list of course) that he's interested in, and he desires to know her well before bedding her.During the ten minutes interaction between the main character and the charming mysterious blonde, I had a drink to allow me to forget the trite predictability of the lame kisses and the fake romanticism.But, no, just minutes before the bodily union between the two souls, a surprise takes place.

That said my interest raised as each chapter unfolded. Knowing how the genre is, working out the inevitable twists and curve balls ensued. That is part of the experience. So is the outlandish nature of plot, and I don't know a soul who thought 'Body Double' was based on anything remotely possible, but they still enjoyed it. This film has something different about it. A subtle expression that grows into an intriguing smile.Director Marcel Langenegger worked with writer, Mark Bomback, to make the film work for both their tastes and sensibilities. Their collaboration is for the good of the project. He also brought in Dante Spinotti, a fine Director of Photography. He was largely responsible for the look of the Chinatown sequence and it was my favorite sequence of events.I wanted to see `Deception' on the strength of Hugh Jackman and Ewan McGregor's involvement with the film. Both are extraordinarily fine actors and I could not imagine either appearing in anything sub-par. They took on assignments that cast them in a different light than most are used to viewing them in.Mr. Jackman dives into his role with the same gusto he has become famous for. I feel that few actors can match his range. His `Wolverine' is much more than a raging mutant. Jackman squarely lifted the `X-Men' gambit to his shoulders and skyrocketed into mega-franchise orbit. He also has history on Broadway and lit the boards afire in `The Boy From Oz'. His turn as 'Van Helsing' the great vampire hunter sees Hugh in the action-adventure region and earning high praise.Mr. McGregor plays an accountant who goes through his daily paces as one of the army of eternal extras who drift through the scenes of New York's rich, powerful, and flamboyant theater of the absurd. McGregor's skill is on display as a timid, almost apologetic excuse of a being that I would have loved to seen introduced ala `Twilight Zone' by Rod Serling. His character certainly passes through it.What gives `Deception' its edge is an outstanding performance by Michelle Williams. Her interaction with both stars is intense, but in particular, with McGregor she is magical. Ms. Williams says more with a glance than words could express. Each scene finds her generously sprinkling talent in all directions. Oh, she does indeed speak, and I savored every word.A quick nod to Charlotte Rampling who I might well have wrote the above paragraph for had she been given more screen time. She makes ample use of what time she does receive. Ms. Rampling has a rather brutal, but matter-of-fact way of taking over a scene. Her dominance is simply never in question.The sliding scale for a psychological thriller begins with `Hitchcock brilliant' and works its way down from there. `Deception' is definitely north of its genres norm, and a decent companion on one of those nights when the phone is not ringing.",3,"Sometimes, it's what you don't see that makes all the difference...",1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,2945,"['Going', 'had', 'fair', 'warning', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'name', 'as', 'much', 'said', 'interest', 'raised', 'chapter', 'unfolded', 'Knowing', 'how', 'genre', 'working', 'out', 'inevitable', 'twists', 'curve', 'balls', 'ensued', 'part', 'experience', 'outlandish', 'nature', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'soul', 'who', 'thought', 'Double', 'was', 'based', 'anything', 'remotely', 'possible', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'something', 'different', 'subtle', 'expression', 'intriguing', 'smile.Director', 'Marcel', 'Langenegger', 'worked', 'writer', 'Mark', 'Bomback', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'tastes', 'sensibilities', 'collaboration', 'good', 'project', 'also', 'brought', 'Dante', 'Spinotti', 'fine', 'Director', 'Photography', 'was', 'largely', 'responsible', 'look', 'Chinatown', 'sequence', 'was', 'favorite', 'sequence', 'events.I', 'wanted', 'see', 'Deception', 'strength', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'involvement', 'film', 'are', 'extraordinarily', 'fine', 'actors', 'could', 'not', 'imagine', 'either', 'appearing', 'anything', 'sub-par', 'took', 'assignments', 'cast', 'different', 'light', 'most', 'are', 'used', 'viewing', 'in.Mr', 'Jackman', 'role', 'same', 'gusto', 'become', 'famous', 'feel', 'few', 'actors', 'can', 'match', 'range', 'Wolverine', 'much', 'more', 'raging', 'mutant', 'Jackman', 'squarely', 'lifted', 'X-Men', 'gambit', 'shoulders', 'skyrocketed', 'mega-franchise', 'orbit', 'also', 'history', 'Broadway', 'lit', 'boards', 'afire', 'Boy', 'From', 'Oz', 'turn', ""'Van"", 'Helsing', 'great', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'Hugh', 'action-adventure', 'region', 'earning', 'high', 'praise.Mr', 'McGregor', 'accountant', 'who', 'daily', 'paces', 'one', 'army', 'eternal', 'extras', 'who', 'drift', 'scenes', 'New', 'York', 'rich', 'powerful', 'flamboyant', 'theater', 'absurd', 'McGregor', 'skill', 'display', 'timid', 'almost', 'apologetic', 'excuse', 'being', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'seen', 'introduced', 'ala', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'character', 'certainly', 'it.What', 'Deception', 'edge', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'interaction', 'stars', 'intense', 'particular', 'McGregor', 'magical', 'Ms.', 'Williams', 'more', 'glance', 'words', 'could', 'express', 'scene', 'generously', 'sprinkling', 'talent', 'directions', 'Oh', 'indeed', 'speak', 'savored', 'word.A', 'quick', 'nod', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'who', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'wrote', 'above', 'paragraph', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'ample', 'use', 'what', 'time', 'receive', 'Ms.', 'Rampling', 'rather', 'brutal', 'matter-of-fact', 'way', 'taking', 'over', 'scene', 'dominance', 'simply', 'never', 'question.The', 'sliding', 'scale', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Hitchcock', 'brilliant', 'way', 'there', 'Deception', 'definitely', 'north', 'genres', 'norm', 'decent', 'companion', 'one', 'nights', 'when', 'phone', 'not', 'ringing']",Deception

Granted, no one is claiming that the sperm was taken out of the prostitute and put into a dead girl across town in order to perpetrate an elaborate frame. On the other hand, no one is claiming that sperm is being taken out of a dead prostitute. That would have perked up the movie a little too much.The first problem with the movie is timing of the release.The Sum of All Fears (Special Collector's Edition)came out right after 9/11 and at the time the Russian policy towards the insurgency in Chechnya wasn't really on anyone's mind since the American policy towards the Taliban was the main debate. This movie comes along during the biggest crash since 1929 and the already hard sell of dashing accountants getting into the glitz and glamor of people who spend 15 hours at the office is impossible when those dashing financial analysts have just lost us all a ton of money.But even without the bad timing, this is an atrocious piece of work. Hugh Jackman might as well be wearing a sign that says ""I am the villain"" the second he enters the frame. Ewan MacGregor does a fine job of playing an accountant who has had all vitality sucked out of him long ago. Unfortunately his character never gets that vitality back so we are caught between a mustache twirling Supervillain (not only can he plot against our hero but also read his mind to know almost everything he does) and a nebbish accountant who is just dead inside.And Michelle Williams as the love interest is dull. When Natasha Hentridge and Charlotte Rampling are offering themselves up, I really can't see anyone falling for Michelle Williams (ok Heath did but he's dead from too many pills so what does that tell you?) She's just boring.Note that I'm talking about the characters and the actors playing them. That's because the plot is so obvious and so inane that you see every major twist coming a mile away. When no one recognizes Hugh Jackman's character at the firm, only Ewan MacGregor doesn't find that strange. When the phones get switched and MacGregor is having great anonymous sex with gorgeous women who also work 15 hour days, he doesn't think to ask where everything is leading (of course, that's the gift horse in mouth syndrome but still) and once Hugh Jackman reveals his evil plan, it's kind of lame. And the last few twists where Ewan MacGregor is required to get a handle on the situation and turn the tables - not terribly believable either. Mostly because Ewan MacGregor is just the boring accountant from the beginning. I was so hoping for him to break into a Renton fromTrainspotting - Director's Cut (Collector's Edition)but I guess he's method acting when he's playing the accountant without vitality.Nothing special.

1175506,A3ALCP02N5EF41,B001CC7PLM,Reader,"[17, 18]","What made the movie very good viewing are the interesting character studies and the excellent portrayals by the two lead actors.  Jonathan leads a rather lonely life as a CPA who does not even develop any ties with the people on whose work he passes judgment on.  When Wyatt comes into his life and opens a new and exciting world beyond the glass towers of corporate Manhattan, he is wide-eyed and smiling to himself with his discovery.  Wyatt is all smooth-talking and self-assured, professionally and socially, while pressing a hidden agenda.  What I liked most about the movie is the phase when these two men, seemingly from two different worlds, interact and a fraternal bond seemed to have developed. As if they have suddenly become the best of friends and share intimate secrets.The movie traces how this initial bond becomes a vehicle for committing a crime ( stealing millions from questionable sources and taking advantage of how these transactions can pass through the international payment systems without being caught immediately) and how the seemingly good friend unravels his intentions to coerce the cooperation of the mousy accountant.  The twist is how the accountant foils the villain's intention, a solution made in accountant heaven  ( with their dogma of ""check and balance""!).The parade of attractive women adds some zest to the story but I think it is the interaction of the two characters which is the essence of the story.Ewan McGregor is excellent as the mousy accountant and leads one to sympathize with his character easily.

Moreover, one notable thing about ""Deception"" is that the film is co-produced by Hugh Jackman himself. You can see why he was attracted to the role he plays in this film - here Hugh Jackman plays a type of character he is not usually associated with - but I still don't see what part of the film's generic script he found so attractive.A meek accountant Jonathan (Ewan McGregor) meets a smooth-talking lawyer named Wyatt (Hugh Jackman) in New York City. They soon become friends, but while Wyatt is away from the city, Jonathan is accidentally introduced to a mysterious sex club Wyatt is a member of, and Jonathan encounters a woman simply called ""S"" (Michelle Williams). Things get complicated and serious, naturally, when Jonathan falls for her and Wyatt comes back.The premise itself is fairly intriguing. I can also forget the numerous plot holes and implausible situations (how many of us would answer the phone and go out to meet a stranger like Jonathan does?). As to the sex club, I would not be surprised if it really exists and watching the supporting players such as Natasha Henstridge, Maggie Q and Charlotte Rampling is amusing. Also, Dante Spinotti's night scene photography using Genesis digital video camera is aptly cold, capturing the atmosphere of the office Jonathan works in.But the film is slow, the characters are flat, and most importantly, the plot is obvious. First-time director Marcel Langenegger drops so many hints as to the story carelessly in the first half of the film that I started to think the predictability is actually a ploy to deceive us.
