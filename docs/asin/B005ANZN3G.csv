If you have Lang Lang Live in Vienna, don't expect the same level of satisfaction. This performance was at the London Round House festival which was intended to spread classical music to non-classical music fans or rock concert goers. Although his piano performance is good, the visual background (a la music video) is very distracting. It surely will disappoint many classical music fans. Half of the disk is filled with ""virtuoso"" piece which is really a self promotion of Lang Lang.",1,Music Video does not belong to Classical Music.,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,603,"['Lang', 'Lang', 'excellent', 'passionate', 'pianist', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'BR', 'utter', 'disappointment', 'have', 'Lang', 'Lang', 'Live', 'Vienna', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'same', 'level', 'satisfaction', 'performance', 'was', 'London', 'Round', 'House', 'festival', 'was', 'intended', 'spread', 'classical', 'music', 'non-classical', 'music', 'fans', 'rock', 'concert', 'goers', 'piano', 'performance', 'good', 'visual', 'background', 'la', 'music', 'video', 'very', 'distracting', 'surely', 'will', 'disappoint', 'many', 'classical', 'music', 'fans', 'Half', 'disk', 'filled', 'virtuoso', 'piece', 'really', 'self', 'promotion', 'Lang', 'Lang']",N/A

1452351,A38NTWCEH0P8MT,B005ANZN3G,George R. Collison,"[40, 43]","Some strongly criticize Lang Lang for showmanship.  Such criticism should be reconsidered.  In the show I saw broadcast live he was called a ""classical rock star"".  That is true.  This is a classical rock concert.  There were no blue hairs in the audience in London.  That in itself, is remarkable;  it was the first classical concert I have ever attended where the average age was under 60.  The piano some times floated in fog, there were streams of images on light panels across the stage.  In the showing I attended, after several pieces, the audience in the theatre stood up and clapped to the screen.  It seemed totally appropriate.  The performance was superb.  The commentator is a bit underwhelming (one view is enough);  on the DVD just fast forward through it.Each generation needs to define its own method to appreciate classical music and to approach it through the technology of its time.  I lived with scratches on LPs for years and learned to marvel at icy clean technical renditions by Horowitz.  Times and tastes change.  I'm quite sure what Liszt's audience in those salons of 19th century Paris heard was not cool precision.  Liszt, by all accounts from the time, was all ablaze in his performances.  He, Georges Sand, and others scandalized Paris;  Parisians loved it. He gave them, in this repressive, highly stratified society, new ways to see themselves, new ways to think about liberty.  Lang Lang, for this new generation of classical listeners, shares that fire.  My 17 year old son, a fine pianist, was hypnotized by the spectacle.  He came home and started playing for 40 minutes.  It was 11:30 pm when he started.  In twenty years, almost all of the current blue haired classical music lovers will be in the grave or in rest homes, myself included.  It is time to listen in a new way.  Get with the program.Stated last, but not as an afterthought I must comment on the tenor of the whole performance.  This young man understands deeply what freedom means.  He breaks boundaries technically and with interpretation.  Isn't that exactly what Liszt was trying to do before his audiences in the mid 19th century?  ""Liszt now"" for me, means exactly that;  we're listening _now_.  It is such a delight to hear with new ears.This is a great performance.  I am delighted it is on DVD.",5,Saw the concert.  It was just incredible.

His playing is magical, he lives up too his reputation as a world class artist and the video arts burn the house down with the most amazing lights and camera arts, all too the highest standard.

1452353,A270MUUEMRKM3N,B005ANZN3G,Mr. Michael Wang,"[7, 16]","I like Lang Lang as I have been following up his career for a number of years. As huge as his stardom is, he is not a great pianist (yet) as his artistry is still in the stage of infancy. Let's forget about his rock star status for now. In terms of pianistic capacities, Kissin is seldom matched. But I do take Lang Lang very seriously. Is he a showman? No. I think he is very genuine expressing his freedom within the right context of the music he plays. So, beyond the corny and superficial smoke & blue lights exhibited in this concert, he plays the music as it should be played based on his understanding and experience. Now let's get to the marketing side of the concert. In live concert, maybe those side shows such as flashing lights or blue smoke might excite younger generations who know nothing about classical music, but do make an effort coming to see Lang Lang live. In the sad days of claasical music with totally diminished audiences, we need to do whatever it taks to let young people experience the beauty of past treasures. In this sense, I give the promoter(s) 5 stars to pack young people in the concert hall so that classical music won't completely die away in another 5 years. But I do give the DVD one star for the viewing experience as the video director lost his sense of providing a sense of continuity of images matching the music. So, I needed to look away from my large TV so that I can concentrate on his playing AND music, of course.My recommendation: Buy the DVD regardless to support classical music if you can. The music along is good enough to compensate the shortcomings of the visual presentation.",1,One star for results and 5 stars for intent,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,1634,"['like', 'Lang', 'Lang', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'up', 'career', 'number', 'years', 'As', 'huge', 'stardom', 'not', 'great', 'pianist', 'yet', 'artistry', 'still', 'stage', 'infancy', 'Let', 'forget', 'rock', 'star', 'status', 'now', 'terms', 'pianistic', 'capacities', 'Kissin', 'seldom', 'matched', 'do', 'take', 'Lang', 'Lang', 'very', 'seriously', 'showman', 'No', 'think', 'very', 'genuine', 'expressing', 'freedom', 'right', 'context', 'music', 'So', 'corny', 'superficial', 'smoke', 'blue', 'lights', 'exhibited', 'concert', 'music', 'should', 'be', 'played', 'based', 'understanding', 'experience', 'Now', 'let', 'get', 'marketing', 'side', 'concert', 'live', 'concert', 'maybe', 'side', 'shows', 'such', 'flashing', 'lights', 'blue', 'smoke', 'might', 'excite', 'younger', 'generations', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'classical', 'music', 'do', 'make', 'effort', 'coming', 'see', 'Lang', 'Lang', 'live', 'sad', 'days', 'claasical', 'music', 'totally', 'diminished', 'audiences', 'need', 'do', 'whatever', 'let', 'young', 'people', 'experience', 'beauty', 'past', 'treasures', 'sense', 'give', 'promoter', '5', 'stars', 'pack', 'young', 'people', 'concert', 'hall', 'classical', 'music', 'wo', ""n't"", 'completely', 'die', 'away', '5', 'years', 'do', 'give', 'DVD', 'one', 'star', 'viewing', 'experience', 'video', 'director', 'lost', 'sense', 'providing', 'sense', 'continuity', 'images', 'matching', 'music', 'So', 'needed', 'look', 'away', 'large', 'TV', 'can', 'concentrate', 'playing', 'music', 'course.My', 'recommendation', 'Buy', 'DVD', 'regardless', 'support', 'classical', 'music', 'can', 'music', 'along', 'good', 'enough', 'compensate', 'shortcomings', 'visual', 'presentation']",N/A

Those who do not like Lang Lang's unique way of presenting a concert need not comment because this was not made for the classical music snobs (which most people, and I would agree) contribute to classical music's demise.  If you want classical music to survive, then you need to support artists who make videos like this.  There's no written rule that says a concert must be done a certain way.  If you're going to comment, comment on the actual music and not everything else going on.  Lang Lang is brilliant.
