1502386,A35NVI7X5JM0LB,B005SH65G8,Dusty Taylor,"[1, 4]","Ireland is as mysteriously unknown as it is amazingly known. From this culturally and historically rich land comes some of the most tantalizing and beautiful, if not controversial, stories known to the pantheon of lore and history. Often a footnote and pawn to the powers that be, but not entirely without full autonomy and consequential self-awareness to the greater dramas of Europe and certainly beyond, Ireland is steeped and mired in stories that beg to be told. It is a land that prides itself in the ability if not the requirement to tell a good story. Their cultural music is as distinct as their gift for the gab. Whats more, the BBC is a leader in documentary. And yet, somehow, this documentary of this land, falls drastically, tragically short of being anything worthy of the story it tries to tell.It is, &#34;a going with the motion,&#34; of sorts. The presenter is drab, the ambient music is dull, the story is hastened, and I am left desperately pleading for the documentary to hit its stride. It never does. It is a complete and total waste. You would do better, MUCH better in buying anything produced by PBS such as their NOVA documentary on the ancient peoples of Ireland or better yet, a book. Any book.And if I am left with any questions on the struggle of Ireland, it is &#34;what did I waste more? My time?

1502387,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B005SH65G8,FYI,"[25, 26]","Identity is a funny thing. Or not. Contentious issues like religion and politics can be polarizing, as is often the case in Ireland. Irish writer and journalist Fergal Keane appropriately begins his dialogue against a stormy Irish coastline, sea crashing against rocks, with the premise that Irish identity has always been less insular and more international than commonly believed. Historically, the ocean was easier to traverse than overland journeys were; many peoples landed on the island, ultimately creating a complex cultural heritage.""The Story of Ireland"" is an intelligently written narrative, beautifully filmed, and deftly presented by Keane. Ancestors are mentioned: the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, Brian Boru, Aoife MacMurrough, Richard De Clare (Strongbow), among others. Many if-onlys are explored: if only the Spanish and Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, had united effectively in 1601; if only the French had landed in County Cork with Wolfe Tone in 1796 (""We were near enough to throw a biscuit ashore,"" wrote Tone in his diary); if only Michael Collins had lived in 1922 instead of the prude-sycophant &Egrave;amon De Velara, who, as Keane points out, commiserated with the Third Reich via his condolences after Hitler finally committed suicide. Even the premise that the Irish are a defiant people is scrutinized, strong in confronting challenges from without, but then facing abuse from Church authorities. The advent of ultramontanism in the mid-19th century laid a foundation for later corruption under De Velara's government, with no division between Church and State.Keane moves from the lyrical myth of St. Patrick, to the near past; recent ghosts haunt. Accompanied by a survivor, he visits an infamous orphanage where a forgotten class of the young, vulnerable, and poor were thrown-away into horrific facilities. It has been shown that these industrial-grade, autocratically run bureaucracies were bastions of abuse. He and Keane wander through a graveyard filled with the poignant gravestones of those victims who didn't make it, their humble grave-markers adorned with plastic saints and rosaries. What a grievous irony that this occurred in a land whose unique Irish Gaelic Christianity produced wonders such asThe Book of Kells, gentle spiritual leaders likeSt. Columba, theologians likeAdomnan of Iona, and those who preserved treasures of Western civilization in monasteries and abbeys. In any case, this series is an informative tromp through Ireland's tumultuous stories.Two disks feature five hour long episodes, all with helpful subtitles (for those of us who have trouble hearing sometimes!): The Age of Invasion, The Age of Conquest, The Age of Revolution, The Age of Union, and The Age of Nations.You also may enjoy the music of the:High Kings: Memory Lane.",5,Exploring Ireland's History and Myths,1354060800,"11 28, 2012",2012,2793,"['Identity', 'funny', 'thing', 'not', 'Contentious', 'issues', 'religion', 'politics', 'can', 'be', 'polarizing', 'often', 'case', 'Ireland', 'Irish', 'writer', 'journalist', 'Fergal', 'Keane', 'appropriately', 'dialogue', 'stormy', 'Irish', 'coastline', 'sea', 'crashing', 'rocks', 'premise', 'Irish', 'identity', 'always', 'been', 'less', 'insular', 'more', 'international', 'commonly', 'believed', 'Historically', 'ocean', 'was', 'easier', 'traverse', 'overland', 'journeys', 'were', 'many', 'peoples', 'landed', 'island', 'ultimately', 'creating', 'complex', 'cultural', 'heritage', 'Story', 'Ireland', 'intelligently', 'written', 'narrative', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'deftly', 'presented', 'Keane', 'Ancestors', 'are', 'mentioned', 'U', 'iacute', 'N', 'eacute', 'ill', 'Brian', 'Boru', 'Aoife', 'MacMurrough', 'Richard', 'De', 'Clare', 'Strongbow', 'others', 'Many', 'if-onlys', 'are', 'explored', 'only', 'Spanish', 'Hugh', ""O'Neill"", 'Earl', 'Tyrone', 'had', 'united', 'effectively', '1601', 'only', 'French', 'had', 'landed', 'County', 'Cork', 'Wolfe', 'Tone', '1796', 'were', 'near', 'enough', 'throw', 'biscuit', 'ashore', 'wrote', 'Tone', 'diary', 'only', 'Michael', 'Collins', 'had', 'lived', '1922', 'instead', 'prude-sycophant', 'Egrave', 'amon', 'De', 'Velara', 'who', 'Keane', 'points', 'out', 'commiserated', 'Third', 'Reich', 'condolences', 'Hitler', 'finally', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Even', 'premise', 'Irish', 'are', 'defiant', 'people', 'scrutinized', 'strong', 'confronting', 'challenges', 'then', 'facing', 'abuse', 'Church', 'authorities', 'advent', 'ultramontanism', 'mid-19th', 'century', 'laid', 'foundation', 'later', 'corruption', 'De', 'Velara', 'government', 'division', 'Church', 'State.Keane', 'moves', 'lyrical', 'myth', 'St.', 'Patrick', 'near', 'past', 'recent', 'ghosts', 'haunt', 'Accompanied', 'survivor', 'infamous', 'orphanage', 'where', 'forgotten', 'class', 'young', 'vulnerable', 'poor', 'were', 'thrown-away', 'horrific', 'facilities', 'been', 'shown', 'industrial-grade', 'autocratically', 'run', 'bureaucracies', 'were', 'bastions', 'abuse', 'Keane', 'wander', 'graveyard', 'filled', 'poignant', 'gravestones', 'victims', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'humble', 'grave-markers', 'adorned', 'plastic', 'saints', 'rosaries', 'What', 'grievous', 'irony', 'occurred', 'land', 'unique', 'Irish', 'Gaelic', 'Christianity', 'produced', 'wonders', 'such', 'asThe', 'Book', 'Kells', 'gentle', 'spiritual', 'leaders', 'likeSt', 'Columba', 'likeAdomnan', 'Iona', 'who', 'preserved', 'treasures', 'Western', 'civilization', 'monasteries', 'abbeys', 'case', 'series', 'informative', 'tromp', 'Ireland', 'tumultuous', 'stories.Two', 'disks', 'feature', 'five', 'hour', 'long', 'episodes', 'helpful', 'subtitles', 'who', 'have', 'trouble', 'hearing', 'sometimes', 'Age', 'Invasion', 'Age', 'Conquest', 'Age', 'Revolution', 'Age', 'Union', 'Age', 'Nations.You', 'also', 'may', 'enjoy', 'music', 'High', 'Kings', 'Memory', 'Lane']",The Story of Ireland

1502390,A5R3U8ZSFKAL4,B005SH65G8,"Paul Lawrence ""'EJL'""","[6, 7]","Fergal Keane starts this five part series on the history of Ireland by talking about how international it was. How it was always more 'connected' to the outside world than we may have previously thought and how it was connected to what was going on around it. How it's story cannot be merely viewed via an isolationist prism. This is a brilliant way of opening up the viewer to the nature of the story they are about to be told.Effectively this is in many ways a straight telling of the history of Ireland from ancient times of the megalith builders through to Roman times and how Ireland has been so intertwined with that other island so nearby. And it's really Keanes ability to dispassionately discuss so much of the interaction between the isles that sit to the west of continental Europe that did so much to make this series for me. The way he shows the to-ing and fro-ing of peoples, ideas, armies and religions. Speaking on a purely personal level this is my first attempt at learning more about Irish history and I'm glad it was presented the way it was.As time moves on the action moves more and more from the battlefield (Vikings, Normans, French and plenty of others 'had a go') to the political boardrooms and corridors of power the action does, obviously, become less thrilling from an outright excitement factor but there is a tension of a different kind as the many powers extant in Ireland jockey for position and power. The series bring us up to speed - circa 2010 or so - and at the same time as it is spending time on the political and social machinations you realise it is also taking time to discuss cultural achievements such as literature. The way the whole thing is blended together is extremely well balanced and well rendered. A bunch of talking heads and experts in specific fields are collared to give their opinion and the very physicality of Ireland is used well to provide visual backdrop. The series even takes time to look at the results of mass Irish migration - mainly in terms of the many Irish who went to the new world to try their luck there.A highly recommended work. Now, it's only left for me to hope The Story of Wales and the Story of Scotland are similarly well rendered!",5,A judicious blend,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,2216,"['Fergal', 'Keane', 'five', 'part', 'series', 'history', 'Ireland', 'talking', 'how', 'international', 'was', 'How', 'was', 'always', 'more', ""'connected"", 'outside', 'world', 'may', 'have', 'previously', 'thought', 'how', 'was', 'connected', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'How', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'merely', 'viewed', 'isolationist', 'prism', 'brilliant', 'way', 'opening', 'up', 'viewer', 'nature', 'story', 'are', 'be', 'told.Effectively', 'many', 'ways', 'straight', 'telling', 'history', 'Ireland', 'ancient', 'times', 'megalith', 'builders', 'Roman', 'times', 'how', 'Ireland', 'been', 'so', 'intertwined', 'other', 'island', 'so', 'nearby', 'really', 'Keanes', 'ability', 'dispassionately', 'discuss', 'so', 'much', 'interaction', 'isles', 'sit', 'west', 'continental', 'Europe', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'make', 'series', 'way', 'to-ing', 'fro-ing', 'peoples', 'ideas', 'armies', 'religions', 'Speaking', 'purely', 'personal', 'level', 'first', 'attempt', 'learning', 'more', 'Irish', 'history', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'presented', 'way', 'was.As', 'time', 'moves', 'action', 'more', 'more', 'battlefield', 'Vikings', 'Normans', 'French', 'plenty', 'others', ""'had"", 'go', 'political', 'boardrooms', 'corridors', 'power', 'action', 'obviously', 'become', 'less', 'thrilling', 'outright', 'excitement', 'factor', 'tension', 'different', 'kind', 'many', 'powers', 'extant', 'Ireland', 'jockey', 'position', 'power', 'series', 'bring', 'speed', 'circa', '2010', 'so', 'same', 'time', 'spending', 'time', 'political', 'social', 'machinations', 'realise', 'also', 'taking', 'time', 'discuss', 'cultural', 'achievements', 'such', 'literature', 'way', 'whole', 'thing', 'blended', 'together', 'extremely', 'well', 'balanced', 'well', 'rendered', 'bunch', 'talking', 'heads', 'experts', 'specific', 'fields', 'are', 'collared', 'give', 'opinion', 'very', 'physicality', 'Ireland', 'used', 'well', 'provide', 'visual', 'backdrop', 'series', 'even', 'time', 'look', 'results', 'mass', 'Irish', 'migration', 'mainly', 'terms', 'many', 'Irish', 'who', 'went', 'new', 'world', 'try', 'luck', 'there.A', 'highly', 'recommended', 'work', 'Now', 'only', 'left', 'hope', 'Story', 'Wales', 'Story', 'Scotland', 'are', 'similarly', 'well', 'rendered']",The Story of Ireland
