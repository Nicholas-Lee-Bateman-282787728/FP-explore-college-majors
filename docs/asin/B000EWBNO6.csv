Every time I listen to his music, it is almost like hearing it for the first time. The man was amazing and to die so early in life  proves the rule that  ""only the good die young."" His claim that he had the fastest right hand in the world goes undisputed by me.

I had hesitated, because I have Anthony Burger playing the piano on several of my DVDs, but this is just really different. The interview with Bill Gaither and the clips from different concerts are all put together beautifully. In addition, there is a precious moment when Mr. Burger is relaying an incident about his little son, that would touch anyone's heart.It could have nothing less than five stars.
