365457,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6303241123,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 46]","For those of you who have not read the story, basically we follow the life of a black stallion named ""Black Beauty"" and ""Blackjack"" when he has his name changed near the center of the film. We watch as Black Beauty goes through all the emotions and feelings of a human through his life. He learns of love from his mother at birth, and later through another horse named Ginger. He learns of friendship through his first family, through a boy named Joe, and even through a archaic taxi driver.  Through the course of an hour and a half, we see the highs and lows of life through the eyes of this beautiful stallion.I feel that the initial response that I will get from this review is that if I do give it a poor review, it means that I agree with the cruel treatment of animals.  First of all that is not the case. I am a vegetarian, not that it has anything to do with animals, but it is fun to say.  There is something I need to get off my chest about this film.  For an hour and a half I sat and watched the cruel treatment of this fine horse by humans.  I watched as the director attempted to show that humans are capable of both love and hate.  A theme used in almost every film today.  My biggest gripe about this film is not with the film itself, but with what was happening behind the camera.  During the course of the film, you could not help but wonder how the trainers were getting these horses to move, act, and react on cue.  I am almost one hundred percent certain that these horses did not have their own trailers, that they did not have an acting coach, and most importantly that there was a scene rehearsal.  I am certain that these animals were thrown right in front of the camera as their trainers did everything possible to make sure that they did everything they were supposed to.For all of those reviews I have read about how this film shows a much needed side of humanity and their cruelty of animals, I think this film is a double standard.  It teaches/shows the cruelty of animals, yet we do not see behind the camera.  I am not a betting man, but if I was I would have to say that perhaps what the camera didn't show was madness, mayhem, and cruelty. I could see it in the extra's eyes that they were not treated fairly (the extras were cows ... you can tell a lot about a cow through the eyes).  Do animals get the same treatment as actors?  Is there a union for these horses, or do they have representation? If the answer is ""no"" to both of these, then I am going to have to say that we DEFINITELY need to look behind the camera and see the true cruelty that is happening to these beasts.Also, why was is this film considered an independent film? I am going out on a limb here by saying that they only reason is due to Alan Cumming.  I think that his early work is considered ""independent"", so they added it to this bookTo sum up quickly, this film was horrible. Not only was my mind constantly questioning the treatment when the cameras went off, but I felt the story was too coincidence. I know it is very Hollywood to have these coincidences, but too many of them make an unbelievable story.  To believe that this horse, of all the horses in the world, came full circle to happiness really made me question the sanity of the director.  The words coming from the horse were to the utmost cheese factor.  The line that sticks so heavily in my mind is hearing Alan Cumming (in character of Black Beauty) say, ""Oats. Wonderful oats."" I was hoping to die a happy man without those words passing through my mind. But oh well, who would have thought it.Overall, this is a children's story and film, so maybe I needed more children to fully enjoy it. Black Beauty was not the film that I was hoping for, nor will I ever rest until my animal friends have proper film representation. I think I am going to call the law offices of Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe. I think they are the only ones that can help...Grade:  * out of *****",1,Oats.

You will recognize at least one face: London cabbie Jerry Barker is played by David Thewlis, who also played Remus Lupin in the Harry Potter series. And I think the snobby lady was played by the same actress who played the owner of the girls' school in the Warner Brothers version of ""The Little Princess.""The story is narrated by Black Beauty himself, a marvelous black horse with a white triangle on his forehead. (In the book, I think it was a diamond, but the horse who acted the part has a triangle, so there it is.) He was raised on a nice farm, but was eventually sold to a place with several children which included a ginger-colored horse named Ginger and a Shetland pony named Merrylegs. He made friends with Ginger, who had been very mean-tempered and unmanageable until Beauty came along. He charmed her and probably would have mounted her in due time, but never got the chance.At this place, a young boy named Joe was apprenticed to the groomsman, and nearly killed Beauty by not knowing how to treat him when he'd been running and was all sweaty and chilled. But Joe was so sorry that when Beauty recovered, he was completely devoted to Beauty. Joe turned out to be quite a competent horseman.Their mistress was very sick, and finally the family had to move to a milder climate. Beauty and Ginger were then sold as a pair to the haughty lady who insisted their heads be pulled up with a bearing reign. Beauty tolerated as best he could, but Ginger eventually rebelled, injuring Beauty in the process.He was sold several times, under various circumstances and given various names, until he came to Jerry Barker, the London cabbie. But then Jerry got sick, and was told he could never drive a cab again, and Beauty was again sold. He was so cruelly mistreated that when he was put up for sale again, the consensus was he was good for nothing but the knackers. But the grown-up Joe recognized him, and bought him to put him to pasture. It was from this pasture that he was telling his story.There's a breathtaking sequence of the birth of Beauty, so if you have children who want to know what that's like, this is the movie for them. And if you know anyone who has ever been cruel to an animal, this is the movie for them, too. Also, as beauty points out when Jerry is kept waiting for hours in the snow for a couple of gents who are getting stinking drunk, these humans are not only cruel to horses, they are cruel to each other.A beautifully made film which is a worthy addition to Warner Brothers' Family Entertainment collection. Decent for children, but not too sweet for adults. And gives parents and kids plenty to talk about.",4,Classic Book; Classic Movie,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2726,"['recommend', 'book', 'even', 'more', 'movie', 'very', 'well-made', 'movie', 'will', 'recognize', 'least', 'one', 'face', 'London', 'cabbie', 'Jerry', 'Barker', 'played', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'Remus', 'Lupin', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'think', 'snobby', 'lady', 'was', 'played', 'same', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'owner', 'girls', 'school', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'version', 'Little', 'Princess', 'story', 'narrated', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'marvelous', 'black', 'horse', 'white', 'triangle', 'forehead', 'book', 'think', 'was', 'diamond', 'horse', 'who', 'acted', 'part', 'triangle', 'was', 'raised', 'nice', 'farm', 'was', 'eventually', 'sold', 'place', 'several', 'children', 'included', 'ginger-colored', 'horse', 'named', 'Ginger', 'Shetland', 'pony', 'named', 'Merrylegs', 'made', 'friends', 'Ginger', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'very', 'mean-tempered', 'unmanageable', 'Beauty', 'came', 'along', 'charmed', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'mounted', 'due', 'time', 'never', 'got', 'chance.At', 'place', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Joe', 'was', 'apprenticed', 'groomsman', 'nearly', 'killed', 'Beauty', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'treat', 'when', ""'d"", 'been', 'running', 'was', 'sweaty', 'chilled', 'Joe', 'was', 'so', 'sorry', 'when', 'Beauty', 'recovered', 'was', 'completely', 'devoted', 'Beauty', 'Joe', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'competent', 'horseman.Their', 'mistress', 'was', 'very', 'sick', 'finally', 'family', 'had', 'move', 'milder', 'climate', 'Beauty', 'Ginger', 'were', 'then', 'sold', 'pair', 'haughty', 'lady', 'who', 'insisted', 'heads', 'be', 'pulled', 'up', 'bearing', 'reign', 'Beauty', 'tolerated', 'best', 'could', 'Ginger', 'eventually', 'rebelled', 'injuring', 'Beauty', 'process.He', 'was', 'sold', 'several', 'times', 'various', 'circumstances', 'given', 'various', 'names', 'came', 'Jerry', 'Barker', 'London', 'cabbie', 'then', 'Jerry', 'got', 'sick', 'was', 'told', 'could', 'never', 'drive', 'cab', 'again', 'Beauty', 'was', 'again', 'sold', 'was', 'so', 'cruelly', 'mistreated', 'when', 'was', 'put', 'up', 'sale', 'again', 'consensus', 'was', 'was', 'good', 'nothing', 'knackers', 'grown-up', 'Joe', 'recognized', 'bought', 'put', 'pasture', 'was', 'pasture', 'was', 'telling', 'story.There', 'breathtaking', 'sequence', 'birth', 'Beauty', 'so', 'have', 'children', 'who', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'cruel', 'animal', 'movie', 'too', 'Also', 'beauty', 'points', 'out', 'when', 'Jerry', 'kept', 'waiting', 'hours', 'snow', 'couple', 'gents', 'who', 'are', 'getting', 'stinking', 'drunk', 'humans', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'horses', 'are', 'cruel', 'other.A', 'beautifully', 'made', 'film', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Family', 'Entertainment', 'collection', 'Decent', 'children', 'not', 'too', 'sweet', 'adults', 'parents', 'kids', 'plenty', 'talk']",N/A

Plenty, because if your child or you are ever going to handle or ride horses for real the child or you will expect horses to think and act like a human as the movie horse did and horses don't think or act like humans. Misunderstanding the real nature of horses can result in injury or death. Most movies anthropomorphize horses, so avoid getting indoctrinated by movie nonsense in regard to the nature of the horse.

365466,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,6303241123,Chrijeff,"[0, 0]","Though perhaps occasionally too intense for the youngest or most tender-hearted kids, this British version of the classic children's bookBlack Beauty (Unabridged Classics)follows the original closely and is beautifully filmed, with a handsome equine lead and an affecting storyline, and a good mastery of the ""look"" of Victorian England.  It was to help ameliorate the sufferings of city horses like Beauty that the original ASPCA was founded in 1866 by Henry Bergh, and although there was a British version (the RSPCA) as early as 1824, enforcement was obviously weak until the 20th Century.  Supported by friends Ginger (the spirited chestnut mare) and Merrylegs (the gallant pony), Beauty looks back in his old age upon the many owners, some kind, some cruel, and some simply thoughtless or neglectful, that he's had in his life: from colthood on a prosperous farm, to an idyllic period with Squire Gordon (Peter Davison) and his family, to the very grand estate of the Wexmires (Eleanor Bron, Peter Cook), to experience as a cart and a livery horse, to pulling Jerry Barker's (David Thewlis) cab in London, his ups and downs are affectingly told.

The animals are portrayed with human feelings and thoughts and IN PARTICULAR the central character (Black Beauty) does a voiceover narration throughout, which is in keeping with the autobiographical first-person viewpoint of the book.  Nothing wrong with this approach of course (Disney has humanized animals forever) but it would be unfair to reject the movie because you weren't expecting it. Think of the movie as a children's fantasy.Most &#34;horse&#34; movies are about racing champions - Seabiscuit, Secretariat, Dreamer, etc.  In contrast, Black Beauty is the life story of an ordinary working horse in 19th-century England, born on a rural farm and used in London for hired hacks.  Thousands of horses lived this kind of ordinary life, and it is the portrayal of Victorian England and how these horses fit into that environment that makes this movie particularly appealing. Even apart from the story, the movie is a joy to watch just for its beauty.  I'm not a &#34;horse&#34; person but the simple scenes of horses running and playing against the backdrop of rural England, with Danny Elfman's outstanding score, are beautiful. At the time I write this a Blu-ray release has been announced, and with its strong visual components this movie will greatly benefit from a hi-definition presentation.It's a shame this little movie slipped in and out of theatres without much notice.

The 1877 novel by Anna Sewell shed light on the mistreatment of horses, and the 1994 film adaptation written and directed by Caroline Thompson renews this heartwarming story for all.I bypassed Black Beauty when I was working at a video store and again when it worked its way into the $5 bin at Wal-Mart. There have been countless films, cartoons, and series taking the name (14 at imdb!) -horse movies themselves are a dime a dozen, and my favorite has always been The Man From Snowy River. This December, however, I chanced upon a second hand copy of Black Beauty. $2, Sean Bean's in it, and hey, my nieces would like it.Well, I should not have waited on my purchase. Alan Cumming voices Beauty, a lovely black stallion who enjoys his early life with Farmer Grey (Sean Bean) and subsequent move to Birtwick Park. There he frolics with fellow horses Ginger and Merry Legs and kindly stable hands John Manly (Joe Carter, Dinotopia) and Joe (Andrew Knott). Unfortunately, hardships and injury force Beauty's move to a cruel Lord and Lady, hostile liveries, a kind but hard working cabbie named Jerry (David Thewlis), and finally backbreaking labor before his return to idyllic pastures with Joe. It's a story that's been tread more than once, but this faithful film includes all the good, bad, and tear jerking of Beauty's life.Although he's top billed, Sean Bean's role as Farmer Grey is rather small-especially considering that in 1994 he was perhaps at his height: Sharpe, Patriot Games, Goldeneye. Nevertheless, Bean gives us a touch of how good he can be as a good guy-it's a rarity in American films and a pleasant surprise. Also often cast as a villian, David Thewlis (Harry Potter, Kingdom of Heaven) also surprises as poor, but kind Jerry. Darling as the actors are in Black Beauty, the star is without a doubt the horse- Docs Keepin Time (The Horse Whisper, Busch Commericials, too.). Thompson (Edward Scissorhands, The Secret Garden, Corpse Bride) smartly makes people are secondary in the film, even though they are the positive or negative influence in Beauty's life.At first an adult may scoff at the idea of a film narrated by a horse, but Alan Cumming (X-2, Tin Man) sells the animal's innocent and loving nature. Just like the book is narrated by Beauty, I found myself waiting for the horse's commentary in the film's quiet moments. At some point during the viewing you are without a doubt on the animals' side. It leads to much food for thought. Yes, why don't those pesky humans listen to Beauty? Why are humans cruel to animals to begin with? Why do we fail to notice when a horse is in pain or has instincts that we fail to comprehend?Underlying the charming work onscreen is the lovely score by Danny Elfman (The Simpsons, Charlie and The Chocolate Factory) When words or visuals won't get you, music will. Cumming's vocals and the music timing fit the horse's work perfectly. I applaud Thompson and her production team for its work-which I'm sure wasn't easy even with the best trained acting horses. The beautiful English locales and majestic looks of the horses practically sell themselves. Again, with such scenery it's easy to be on the horse's side. Nods to the 19th century are also enchanting. The nobility's clothes versus the poor, Dickensian streets of London, carriages and coaches bring us back to a time we often imagine as lofty and ideal. In fact, Beauty's telling shows us how low and ignorant those times often were.Naturally, all the visuals mean diddly if you haven't got a story. Black Beauty could have been done with claymation ala Gumby and it would still turn the heart of anyone. My nieces are young and can be touchy-so I put on the DVD for a solo viewing-besides, I could get some lovely screen captures. It's been many years since my horse phase (does every kid have a horse phase?) I haven't read books like The Saddle Club or King of The Wind in years. I dare say its been twenty years since I've read Black Beauty. Even so, when my nieces borrow books from me, Sewell's classic is the one I always suggest. Unfortunately, my nieces saw a cartoon version and said it was too sad. Black Beauty is very sad, down right upsetting in some parts, yet it's the story my father and I always discuss when we pick up the kids at school. It's as if this kind of emotion is necessary for youth. Books and film like Old Yeller, Where The Red Fern Grows, Shane. Children ought to learn about the extremes of the human-or horse-condition. Learning how to cry can do us all a bit of good.Thompson smartly frames Black Beauty with happy opening and closing scenes. Just in case you aren't familiar with the story, you need to know it has positive outcome. There were moments in my viewing I expected, and others I had forgotten-but each brought a tear to my eye or a choke in my throat. I don't recall the reception this film received upon its release in 94, but Black Beauty is kind of like Les Miserables or The Ten Commandments. Sometimes a story is too good to mess up-too good for critics and box offices numbers to matter.Any age, animal lovers or not, Black Beauty can be enjoyed by anyone, and such family friendly entertainment is tough to find at such an affordable price. Black Beauty is available at most retailers under $10, cheaper if you know where to shop. As much as I whole heartily endorse Black Beauty, parents should be careful with those under ten or any extra-sensitive kids. The film is rated G, but a pre-viewing without the kids is a safe way to determine when your child is ready for this heartwarming, but tough story. Be on the look out for some sad goodbye sequences and animal abuse. One upsetting horse death might want to be skipped by parents all together.Naturally, the film comes with the standard warnings about animals on set, although the DVD is devoid of behind the scenes or interactive featurettes that might help kids separate fact from fiction. It's wise to remind younger audiences that the story does have a happy ending, and it's a purely fiction film-although it brought about social changes on the mistreatment of horses. Depending on the younger folks' reactions, parents could consider directing young readers to the book or the story of invalid author Anna Sewell. The wealth of material and emotion experience around Black Beauty is worth the tug at any and all heart strings. Share Black Beauty with the young and old.",5,Classic rendition,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,6491,"['choice', 'requirement', 'school', 'kid', 'probably', 'read', 'Black', 'Beauty', '1877', 'novel',

I will suffer through bad acting, awful plots, and overly precious child actors in just about any horse movie, and for me to say Black Beauty was almost unbearable is a statement and a half. I was hoping for so much more from this film after reading about how much more faithful a version it was. Having sat through two '80s animated monstrosities, an entertaining but in-name-only New Zealand made TV series, and a downright awful '70s version that has Beauty in the circus, going to war, and involved with a bunch of Irish Travelers, I was expecting much better from something prouduced in the '90s.It all starts innocently enough, with the lovely Sean Bean attending to Beauty from his birth and throughout his training and though I was a bit annoyed that the fox hunt was cut I could understand why something so brutal was left out. From thereonin it was all downhill. Absolutely pointless changes were made, nobody is permitted to die, they simply get fired or move to the country, and if we aren't shown anything an offhand remark tells us that 'all the other horse were saved too'. I can understand not wanting to frighten children but for heaven's sake, animals died in Babe didn't they?Black Beauty was not intended to be a kids' book, it was meant to draw attention to animal cruelty of the time period and for it to be so dumbed down is annoying. We are told Ginger is vicious, and there is an offhand comment about previous bad owners but that's about it. Only Beauty is given a voice and Merrylegs' and Ginger's stories are left frustratingly untold, replaced with overlong shots of them frolicking that will have even children getting antsy. And how annoying is it that Ginger is bizarrely made into a love interest? At least with the other Black Beauties the changes were apparent enough from the start that you weren't expecting much later on.Weird edits give us random shots of doors as scenes end or shots of Beauty tossing his head for minutes on end. The movie is 87 minutes long but because of the extended horse footage it seems to take forever. You know there's a problem when I'm counting down the minutes to when David Thewlis pops up instead of swooning over the horsies.I'm not so heartless as to not admit that the film made me cry, twice no less, but those were the only times I felt anything other than apathy or annoyance. It's too bad, because this really had the potential to be like Nightmare Before Christmas or Spirited Away and have a crossover appeal to young and old audiences. If you want a good horse film you won't have to suffer too much through, get Misty instead and, for a lush children's period piece, pick up the '95 incarnation of A Little Princess. Either way you'll have a nice family movie that will encourage kids to pick up a book without insulting your intelligence in the process.",2,Overhyped and Pointlessly Altered,1051747200,"05 1, 2003",2003,2851,"['love', 'horses', 'will', 'suffer', 'bad', 'acting', 'awful', 'plots', 'overly', 'precious', 'child', 'actors', 'just', 'horse', 'movie', 'say', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'was', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'statement', 'half', 'was', 'hoping', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'reading', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'faithful', 'version', 'was', 'Having', 'sat', 'two', ""'80s"", 'animated', 'monstrosities', 'entertaining', 'in-name-only', 'New', 'Zealand', 'made', 'TV', 'series', 'downright', 'awful', 'version', 'Beauty', 'circus', 'going', 'war', 'involved', 'bunch', 'Irish', 'Travelers', 'was', 'expecting', 'much', 'better', 'something', 'prouduced', ""'90s.It"", 'innocently', 'enough', 'lovely', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'attending', 'Beauty', 'birth', 'training', 'was', 'bit', 'annoyed', 'fox', 'hunt', 'was', 'cut', 'could', 'understand', 'why', 'something', 'so', 'brutal', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'thereonin', 'was', 'downhill', 'Absolutely', 'pointless', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'nobody', 'permitted', 'die', 'simply', 'get', 'fired', 'move', 'country', 'are', ""n't"", 'shown', 'anything', 'offhand', 'remark', 'other', 'horse', 'were', 'saved', 'too', 'can', 'understand', 'not', 'wanting', 'frighten', 'children', 'heaven', 'sake', 'animals', 'died', 'Babe', 'did', ""n't"", 'Black', 'Beauty', 'was', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'kids', 'book', 'was', 'meant', 'draw', 'attention', 'animal', 'cruelty', 'time', 'period', 'be', 'so', 'dumbed', 'down', 'annoying', 'are', 'told', 'Ginger', 'vicious', 'offhand', 'comment', 'previous', 'bad', 'owners', 'Only', 'Beauty', 'given', 'voice', 'Merrylegs', 'Ginger', 'stories', 'are', 'left', 'frustratingly', 'untold', 'replaced', 'overlong', 'shots', 'frolicking', 'will', 'have', 'even', 'children', 'getting', 'antsy', 'how', 'annoying', 'Ginger', 'bizarrely', 'made', 'love', 'interest', 'least', 'other', 'Black', 'Beauties', 'changes', 'were', 'apparent', 'enough', 'start', 'were', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'later', 'on.Weird', 'edits', 'give', 'random', 'shots', 'doors', 'scenes', 'end', 'shots', 'Beauty', 'tossing', 'head', 'minutes', 'end', 'movie', '87', 'minutes', 'long', 'extended', 'horse', 'footage', 'take', 'forever', 'know', 'problem', 'when', ""'m"", 'counting', 'down', 'minutes', 'when', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'up', 'instead', 'swooning', 'horsies.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'heartless', 'not', 'admit', 'film', 'made', 'cry', 'twice', 'less', 'were', 'only', 'times', 'felt', 'anything', 'other', 'apathy', 'annoyance', 'too', 'bad', 'really', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'Nightmare', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'have', 'crossover', 'appeal', 'young', 'old', 'audiences', 'want', 'good', 'horse', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'suffer', 'too', 'much', 'get', 'Misty', 'instead', 'lush', 'children', 'period', 'piece', 'pick', 'up', ""'95"", 'incarnation', 'A', 'Little', 'Princess', 'way', ""'ll"", 'have', 'nice', 'family', 'movie', 'will', 'encourage', 'kids', 'pick', 'up', 'book', 'insulting', 'intelligence', 'process']",N/A

There were a few things I noticed.1. In the book, Beauty's mother taught him many lessons, including not to ever bite or kick even in play and to always do his best. You could see how this shaped how Beauty responded to his various situations in life. In the movie, apparently he just developed that out of nowhere. When he collapsed under the weight of the drunk rider, he said he had been taught to be faithful to his rider. I found myself wondering where that came from in the context of the movie.2. There was no explanation as to why Ginger was so bad-tempered. In the book, Merrylegs explained to Beauty that Ginger didn't like biting, she had just been so badly treated that she didn't know what else to do and she herself explained she'd been taken from her mother and broken in too early. You don't get that in the movie, so you don't feel any empathy toward her. And I would like to have heard Beauty's indignant speech about he wasn't a pony and he didn't turn anyone out of their home.3. What was the deal with Merrylegs opening the stalls and letting the other horses out?4. There was no explanation as to why it was such a big deal for Jerry and Beauty to take the woman to see her family on Sunday. The issues of cab horses working every day versus having a day off on Sunday was a pretty big deal in the book. And the transition to that scene was so quick I actually missed it. That was all just far too rushed.5. When Jerry and Beauty were in the field in the country you could tell Beauty was having fun and appreciated the opportunity. But I really wanted to hear him say the lines in the book about how he couldn't decide which thing to do first, eat the grass, roll around on his back, lay down and rest or gallop around.6. They really glossed over some of the harder aspects of Beauty's life. This was a rated G movie and geared for very young children. They should have made it PG and targeted a little bit older audience. That really would have made a much bigger impact and been truer to the book.7. The end was kind of anti-climactic. Oh, and when he was laying under the tree and reflecting on his life, he said he could imagine being with his friends at Birtwick. Did they mention the name of Squire Gordon's house earlier in the movie? If so, I missed it.",3,Kind of disappointing,1284163200,"09 11, 2010",2010,2402,"['had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'finished', 'movie', 'was', 'kept', 'waiting', 'something', 'happen', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'noticed.1', 'book', 'Beauty', 'mother', 'taught', 'many', 'lessons', 'including', 'not', 'ever', 'bite', 'kick', 'even', 'play', 'always', 'do', 'best', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'shaped', 'how', 'Beauty', 'responded', 'various', 'situations', 'life', 'movie', 'apparently', 'just', 'developed', 'nowhere', 'When', 'collapsed', 'weight', 'drunk', 'rider', 'said', 'had', 'been', 'taught', 'be', 'faithful', 'rider', 'found', 'wondering', 'where', 'came', 'context', 'movie.2', 'was', 'explanation', 'why', 'Ginger', 'was', 'so', 'bad-tempered', 'book', 'Merrylegs', 'explained', 'Beauty', 'Ginger', 'did', ""n't"", 'biting', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'so', 'badly', 'treated', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'explained', ""'d"", 'been', 'taken', 'mother', 'broken', 'too', 'early', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'empathy', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'heard', 'Beauty', 'indignant', 'speech', 'was', ""n't"", 'pony', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'anyone', 'home.3', 'What', 'was', 'deal', 'Merrylegs', 'opening', 'stalls', 'letting', 'other', 'horses', '4', 'was', 'explanation', 'why', 'was', 'such', 'big', 'deal', 'Jerry', 'Beauty', 'take', 'woman', 'see', 'family', 'Sunday', 'issues', 'cab', 'horses', 'working', 'day', 'having', 'day', 'off', 'Sunday', 'was', 'pretty', 'big', 'deal', 'book', 'transition', 'scene', 'was', 'so', 'quick', 'actually', 'missed', 'was', 'just', 'far', 'too', 'rushed.5', 'When', 'Jerry', 'Beauty', 'were', 'field', 'country', 'could', 'tell', 'Beauty', 'was', 'having', 'fun', 'appreciated', 'opportunity', 'really', 'wanted', 'hear', 'say', 'lines', 'book', 'how', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'thing', 'do', 'first', 'eat', 'grass', 'roll', 'around', 'back', 'lay', 'down', 'rest', 'gallop', 'around.6', 'really', 'glossed', 'harder', 'aspects', 'Beauty', 'life', 'was', 'rated', 'G', 'movie', 'geared', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'PG', 'targeted', 'little', 'bit', 'older', 'audience', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'bigger', 'impact', 'been', 'truer', 'book.7', 'end', 'was', 'kind', 'anti-climactic', 'Oh', 'when', 'was', 'laying', 'tree', 'reflecting', 'life', 'said', 'could', 'imagine', 'being', 'friends', 'Birtwick', 'Did', 'mention', 'name', 'Squire', 'Gordon', 'house', 'earlier', 'movie', 'so', 'missed']",N/A

Although lovingly filmed, with very pretty scenery, nice settings and good actors, I thought this movie was disappointing.Alan Cummings was given an overly saccharine script, in my opinion, without honest realism.  Ginger was portrayed as Beauty's love interest and I thought this incomprehensible, since Black Beauty is a gelding and it detracted from the true meaning of the story; that Ginger, a close companion during the best days of their youth together, was squandered and brought low by mens' cruelty.I also found it jarring that none of the other horses were given voices of their own.  It detracted from the film, and made for an odd sense of dislocation, as you watch two horses acting out a scene - one with a voice and the other without.This film also succumbs to putting a human character front and center in the story.  The story is supposed to be about Black Beauty and his life, and not with any particular person.Lastly, while some scenes were well done - notably Black Beauty's first experience with shoes - most of the horse scenes looked fake.  Few and far between are the movies that portray horses in realistic ways.  This is not one of them.  And while I greatly admire Doc's Keeping Time, the Quarter Horse who played the main role, I thought he was the wrong physical type for it.  I think the filmmakers would have served the film better by using a horse more suited to the era and to the work being asked.I recommend the film highly for children, but for adults looking for a good horse movie - it will be amusing but otherwise uninteresting.",3,I'm sure kids will love it but adults be prepared,1081123200,"04 5, 2004",2004,1695,"['love', 'horses', 'will', 'watch', 'almost', 'movie', 'am', 'also', 'sensitive', 'correct', 'portrayals', 'film', 'lovingly', 'filmed', 'very', 'pretty', 'scenery', 'nice', 'settings', 'good', 'actors', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointing.Alan', 'Cummings', 'was', 'given', 'overly', 'saccharine', 'script', 'opinion', 'honest', 'realism', 'Ginger', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Beauty', 'love', 'interest', 'thought', 'incomprehensible', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'gelding', 'detracted', 'true', 'meaning', 'story', 'Ginger', 'close', 'companion', 'best', 'days', 'youth', 'together', 'was', 'squandered', 'brought', 'low', 'mens', 'cruelty.I', 'also', 'found', 'jarring', 'none', 'other', 'horses', 'were', 'given', 'voices', 'own', 'detracted', 'film', 'made', 'odd', 'sense', 'dislocation', 'watch', 'two', 'horses', 'acting', 'out', 'scene', 'one', 'voice', 'other', 'without.This', 'film', 'also', 'putting', 'human', 'character', 'front', 'center', 'story', 'story', 'supposed', 'be', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'life', 'not', 'particular', 'person.Lastly', 'scenes', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'notably', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'first', 'experience', 'shoes', 'most', 'horse', 'scenes', 'looked', 'fake', 'Few', 'far', 'are', 'movies', 'portray', 'horses', 'realistic', 'ways', 'not', 'one', 'greatly', 'admire', 'Doc', 'Keeping', 'Time', 'Quarter', 'Horse', 'who', 'played', 'main', 'role', 'thought', 'was', 'wrong', 'physical', 'type', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'have', 'served', 'film', 'better', 'using', 'horse', 'more', 'suited', 'era', 'work', 'being', 'asked.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'highly', 'children', 'adults', 'looking', 'good', 'horse', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'amusing', 'otherwise', 'uninteresting']",N/A

Accordingly, she made a horse - the titular character - the narrator of the story.  This film version, unlike prior efforts, retains this tactic, and thanks to Alan Cummings' wonderful voice-over, it works extremely well.  BB is an eager, pleasant horse who just wants to frolic with his friends, give his humans a good ride, and eat his oats.  Curmudgeons out there (and I'm looking at you, Roger Ebert) may smirk and say that real horses wouldn't talk this way.  Well, they may be right, but until a real horse tells me otherwise, I choose to suspend my disbelief.BB starts his life in a bucolic setting and quickly meets lifelong friends, his girlfriend Ginger, Merrylegs the pony, and the lad Joe.  This idyllic setting cannot last, and BB is forced to join the harsh world of working England.  Owners range from inconsiderate to malicious to tender (most notably a young David Thewlis as a cab driver), and the world has many harsh lessons to teach our young horse.  Some of these messages can be frightening for smaller kiddies, but tykes also seem to be able to tap into the strong messages of love and friendship that underpin the story.  The stirring sights of the horses at play will also lift the darkest spirits.This is a rated 'G' movie that adults and children can enjoy together.  Prepare to do some serious sniffling as the story progresses, and Danny Elfman's soundtrack is wonderful.  At the end of the story, as BB reflects on his life, parents and children will feel a bit wiser and have a stronger affinity for their four-legged friends.

Though not completely faithful to Anna Sewell's classic storyBlack Beauty (Sterling Classics), this film version stays true in many aspects to the spirit of the story. Told from the point of view of Black Beauty (voiced by Alan Cummings), the story traces the life and times of a beautiful black stallion, Black Beauty from his birth and idyllic beginnings with a squire's family to being worked cruelly by other owners over a period of twenty or so years.The story has its uplifting moments, as when Black Beauty narrates his story - of good friends MerryLegs the plucky pony, to his tempestuous and fiery-willed lady friend, Ginger; of being treated with kindness and respect, and then to the bleak, dark moments of working round-the-clock and being treated with cruelty and indifference. The score is achingly beautiful and the cinematography is gorgeous, giving viewers a glimpse of life in Victorian England. The horse's voice rings true and clear, and there isn't the cutesy talking animals seen in other movies.
