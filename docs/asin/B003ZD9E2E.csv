1377274,ADGRC6O3AGRQL,B003ZD9E2E,"Erick Rasmussen ""Theater Competent""","[34, 34]","Just in time for the holiday season, Cher: The Film Collection is released.This is a set of films that Cher fans, movie fans, cine-philes, and everyone in between can enjoy. Six movies featuring our girl Cher are presented beautifully in one collection for a reasonable price.Good Times (1967) was an outrageous vehicle for Sonny and Cher. This movie was made slightly before their hugely successful TV show. Good Times is about Sonny trying to come up with an idea for a movie for the two of them to star in. It is goofy and extremely campy; what would you expect from these two. Not the greatest movie in the collection, but worth a watch on a lazy afternoon. William Friedkin (The Exorcist) makes his directorial debut.Chastity (1969) sounds familiar? Sonny and Cher's daughter, well now son, was conceived during the making of this movie.  She was named after this movie, not the movie being named after her (contrary to popular belief). Sonny wrote this for Cher because he wanted to showcase her as a serious actress. This may be Sonny's best attempt to be serious, but the goofiness of the movie is almost outweighing the seriousness. The drama that went on behind the scenes on this movie would have made for a better movie. Cher cheated on Sonny because she was furious with him over how Chastity was turning out. There is next to no plot to this movie. Cher plays Chastity, a curious girl exploring the world of sex and drugs.Silkwood (1983) is amazing. Cher plays a supporting character, Dolly, who is Meryl Streep's roommate and best friend. Cher plays a lesbian with no flash or fance....and she does it beautifully. Never before or after has Cher looked so homely. This film is a drama in the highest degree. No longer in print, the only way to get this would be to buy it used or in this collection. Mike Nichols directs.Moonstruck (1987) is Cher's best known role. She was an academy award for her portrayal of an Italian lady trying to do the right thing in her own way. She is magnetic here, magical, even heart wrenching. One of the greatest performances from any actress. One of the greatest movies ever made. Definitely not to be missed.Mermaids (1990) completes Cher's emergence into film stardom. Cher is the Jewish mother of two girls trying to grow up in the 1960s. Like any mother, Cher's character makes it as difficult as she can. After another break up, Cher, as Mrs. Flax, loads up the car and drives everyone to Massachusetts to begin another new life there. Of the movies in this collection, Mermaids is by far the most fun.Tea with Mussolini (1999) finds a relatively small part for Cher. Maybe one of the most underrated movies of this time period, Tea with Mussolini is remarkably thoughtful and heartfelt. Set just before WWII, a group of wealthy English women raise a child whose mother has died. It's nice to see that this movie was included in this set and can be brought into the light once again. Maybe more people will appreciate it after a second viewing.There it is, 6 movies on 6 disc's. If you own these movies already individually, its not worth buying as there are no new special features on here.Sadly missing from this collection are a handful of Cher's great films like Mask, Witches of Eastwick, Suspect, If These Walls Could Talk, Faithful, Stuck On You, and most upsetting of all, Come Back to the Five And Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (which has still YET to be released on DVD!!!!)Bottom Line:If you don't already own these movies, do yourself a favor and buy this collection. These will surely warm up your cold winter nights this holiday season.With love.",5,Cher gets her own boxset...Finally!,1288915200,"11 5, 2010",2010,3613,"['Just', 'time', 'holiday', 'season', 'Cher', 'Film', 'Collection', 'released.This', 'set', 'films', 'Cher', 'fans', 'movie', 'fans', 'cine-philes', 'everyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Six', 'movies', 'featuring', 'girl', 'Cher', 'are', 'presented', 'beautifully', 'one', 'collection', 'reasonable', 'price.Good', 'Times', '1967', 'was', 'outrageous', 'vehicle', 'Sonny', 'Cher', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'slightly', 'hugely', 'successful', 'TV', 'show', 'Good', 'Times', 'Sonny', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'movie', 'two', 'star', 'goofy', 'extremely', 'campy', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'two', 'Not', 'greatest', 'movie', 'collection', 'watch', 'lazy', 'afternoon', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'Exorcist', 'directorial', 'debut.Chastity', '1969', 'familiar', 'Sonny', 'Cher', 'daughter', 'well', 'now', 'son', 'was', 'conceived', 'making', 'movie', 'was', 'named', 'movie', 'not', 'movie', 'being', 'named', 'contrary', 'popular', 'belief', 'Sonny', 'wrote', 'Cher', 'wanted', 'showcase', 'serious', 'actress', 'may', 'be', 'Sonny', 'best', 'attempt', 'be', 'serious', 'goofiness', 'movie', 'almost', 'outweighing', 'seriousness', 'drama', 'went', 'scenes', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'movie', 'Cher', 'cheated', 'Sonny', 'was', 'furious', 'how', 'Chastity', 'was', 'turning', 'out', 'next', 'plot', 'movie', 'Cher', 'Chastity', 'curious', 'girl', 'exploring', 'world', 'sex', 'drugs.Silkwood', '1983', 'amazing', 'Cher', 'supporting', 'character', 'Dolly', 'who', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'roommate', 'best', 'friend', 'Cher', 'lesbian', 'flash', 'fance', 'beautifully', 'Cher', 'looked', 'so', 'homely', 'film', 'drama', 'highest', 'degree', 'No', 'longer', 'print', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'would', 'be', 'buy', 'used', 'collection', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'directs.Moonstruck', '1987', 'Cher', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'was', 'academy', 'award', 'portrayal', 'Italian', 'lady', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'own', 'way', 'magnetic', 'here', 'magical', 'even', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'One', 'greatest', 'performances', 'actress', 'One', 'greatest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Definitely', 'not', 'be', 'missed.Mermaids', '1990', 'Cher', 'emergence', 'film', 'stardom', 'Cher', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'two', 'girls', 'trying', 'grow', 'up', '1960s', 'mother', 'Cher', 'character', 'as', 'difficult', 'can', 'break', 'up', 'Cher', 'Mrs.', 'Flax', 'up', 'car', 'everyone', 'Massachusetts', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'there', 'movies', 'collection', 'Mermaids', 'far', 'most', 'fun.Tea', 'Mussolini', '1999', 'relatively', 'small', 'part', 'Cher', 'Maybe', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'movies', 'time', 'period', 'Tea', 'Mussolini', 'remarkably', 'thoughtful', 'heartfelt', 'Set', 'just', 'WWII', 'group', 'wealthy', 'English', 'women', 'raise', 'child', 'mother', 'died', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'included', 'set', 'can', 'be', 'brought', 'light', 'once', 'again', 'Maybe', 'more', 'people', 'will', 'appreciate', 'second', 'viewing.There', '6', 'movies', '6', 'disc', 'own', 'movies', 'already', 'individually', 'not', 'worth', 'buying', 'are', 'new', 'special', 'features', 'here.Sadly', 'missing', 'collection', 'are', 'handful', 'Cher', 'great', 'films', 'Mask', 'Witches', 'Eastwick', 'Suspect', 'Walls', 'Could', 'Talk', 'Faithful', 'Stuck', 'most', 'upsetting', 'Come', 'Back', 'Five', 'Dime', 'Jimmy', 'Dean', 'Jimmy', 'Dean', 'still', 'YET', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'own', 'movies', 'do', 'favor', 'buy', 'collection', 'will', 'surely', 'warm', 'up', 'cold', 'winter', 'nights', 'holiday', 'love']",Cher: The Film Collection (Good Times / Chastity / Silkwood / Moonstruck / Mermaids / Tea with Mussolini)

Laying on the couch over the last two weeks being unable to do anything has been made bearable thanks to books and movies. How many re-runs of Friends, and Everybody Loves Raymond can one watch?Moonstruck is by far one of my favorite movies. The paring of Nicholas Cage and Cher was shear magic. And, Mermaids, well....who didn't want a mom who served cheese doodles for dinner?For a woman who started out on TV, showing her belly button and swinging her long, silky, straight black hair, Cher has really made a name for herself.As the daughter of a Gay man who absolutely loves Cher, I can tell you that passing this along to Dad as much as I want to won't be happening. I had never seen Tea With Mussoloni or Chasity and loved them too.Cher's range is truly impressive. The woman shocked the world with her costumes in the 80's but I believe as an actress she is one of the best.  I cannot wait to see her newest Burlesque with Christina Aguilerar.

1377284,ATJRTEOGW5OZN,B003ZD9E2E,Rons Reviews,"[9, 10]","Few performers can rival the career of Cher and few can fill their case with the awards she has received including an Academy Award, a Grammy, an Emmy, and more.  Not only does she hold the Hot 100 record for the longest hit making career span with 33 years between the release of her first and most recent number one singles, she also starred in her first motion picture (Good Times) in 1967 and returns to the big screen in 2010's ""Burlesque"".It is the release of ""Burlesque"" that prompts MGM to package six of the actresses performance into ""Cher: The Film Collection"" which hit shelves on November 2nd 2010.  Though the set does not include some of the films you may expect such as ""Mask"", ""The Witches of Eastwick"", and ""Come Back to the Five and Dime Jimmie Dean Jimmie Dean"", the set does provide one with the evolution of an actress.  The exclusion of the above mentioned films certainly has more to do with studio politics than with their respective worthiness.The films in the collection include six films for the true Cher fan, but only three for movie fans.  Opening with ""Good Times"" from 1967 we are introduced to Cher, and then husband and performing partner Sonny Bono, playing themselves trying to come up with an idea for a movie in which they can star and thus capitalize on the fame currently being generated by their hit records.  ""Good Times"" combines the camp of the beach movies of the era with the sketch comedy that Sonny and Cher would display in their hit television show.  The comedy sketches on the ""The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour"" usually lasted about five minutes, which is how much actual good time can be found in this bomb.Two years later Sonny would write and produce ""Chastity"" in an attempt to showcase Cher as a serious actress.  Unfortunately the film showcases a lack of writing and direction, and Cher appears to be wandering aimlessly through the film in both character and performance.Luckily for Cher, she would stay away from the big screen for more than ten years.  The absence allows the few movie goers who experienced ""Good Times"" and ""Chastity"" time to get over those weak efforts, and time for Cher to grow as an actress.  Though it does not appear to be a big stretch for her, Cher's performance in ""Silkwood"" displays substantial growth from her previous endeavors and garnered her a Best-Supporting Actress nomination.  Silkwood is a powerful film that clearly belongs to Meryl Streep, who portrays Karen Silkwood, the nuclear facility worker who takes on a huge corporation. Despite Silkwood being a starring vehicle for Streep, Cher holds her own alongside both Streep and Kurt Russell.Two years after the ""Silkwood"", Cher would cement herself as a leading lady in ""Mask"".  Unfortunately ""Mask"" is not included in this collection.  Up to this point there was a similarity in the characters Cher portrayed, but in 1987 she would truly show her range by starring in ""The Witches of Eastwick"", ""Suspect"". and ""Moonstruck"".  The later being the only one of the three included in this collection, and clearly the gem in Chers storied career as she sheds all pre-conceived notions as to who she is and what she can do in this Academy Award winning performance.  Cher portrays Italian widow Loretta with subtle brilliance in this Norman Jewison directed romantic comedy that also features Nicolas Cage, Olympia Dukakis, Danny Aiello, and Vincent Gardenia.Unfortunately Cher would follow ""Moonstruck"" three years later with the disappointing ""Mermaids"".  Though surrounded by a talented cast including Winona Ryder, Christina Ricci, and the always enjoyable Bob Hoskins,"" Mermaids"" drowns amidst a sea of eighties tripe.  This pointless story follows single mom Cher and her two daughters (Ryder and Ricci) from town to town as Cher attempt to avoid scandal.  ""Mermaids"" is full of squandered potential in both storytelling and performance, as all lack development.The Cher film collection is rounded out by ""Tea with Mussolini""; an elegant endeavor set in pre WWII Florence Italy where the elite meet.  Surrounded by a legendary cast of actresses including Dame Judi Dench, Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith, and Lily Tomlin, Cher plays an American performer and lover of art who invades the serenity of the English ladies environment, and eventually becomes their savior amidst the outbreak of war.  ""Tea with Mussolini: is an investment as it takes time for the story to develop and to appreciate Chers performance as her portrayal of the brash American is so strong, that it seems jarringly out of place in the first hour of this stylish film.Though a perfect Christmas present for any Cher fan, and certainly priced to move, this new offering may struggle during the holiday shopping season simply due to an audience that already owns the popular inclusions, and has no interest in films they quite possibly have not heard of.  The lack of bonus material does not help the situation.There are certainly fans of ""Mermaids"" out there that will balk at the review, but it is ""Silkwood"", ""Moonstruck"", and ""Tea with Mussolini"" that make this collection worth owning.  ""Good Times"" and ""Chastity"" are fun for a few minutes simply to see the early years, but not worth owning.Recommendation: Buy the collection if you don't already own the films, and give away ""Good Times"" and ""Chastity"" as white elephant gifts.",3,Cher: The Film Collection,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,5356,"['Few', 'performers', 'can', 'rival', 'career', 'Cher', 'few', 'can', 'fill',

Singer, recording artist, gay icon, concert performer, televison personality, and movie actress. This beautiful box set shows the world Cher's varied career on the big screen with movie performances from the 1960's to the late '90's, and its really a neat time capsule into one of the most extraordinary women of our time.This set features six of Cher's films, from major boxoffice bombs to Oscar winning films that have gone on to be loved by fans and critics alike. The first two movies are really unforgettable: ""Good Times"" (1967) features Sonny and Cher as themselves doing spoofs of various films. As bad as that one is ""Chasity"" (1969), named after their daughter, is even worse. Written and produced by Sonny it was suppose to showcase Cher's dramatic capabilites. Instead both films are pretty much forgotten and although they were terrible one can see the potential Cher had, even at this early point in her career, to become a respected and sought-after actress. It is evident: the talent was there, but the material was non-existent.Next we have ""Silkwood"" (1983). Although a major movie vehicle for Meryl Streep, Cher proved she could act with the best of actresses and hold her own. She really steals the film. While watching Cher in this, you forget about the music, the Bob Mackie costumes, and the persona; instead you see a future Oscar winner toning her craft.Of course everyone knows ""Moonstruck"" (1987), the movie that garnered Cher her Oscar as Best Actress where she proved to everyone, even the Hollywood naysayers, that she COULD act. Sonny Bono told her on the day of the Academy Award's ceremony that she was going to win...obviously he always knew she had the talent.""Mermaids"" (1990) features Cher's fun side and it has a great soundtrack, with the film grossing an amazing $80,000,000 at the boxoffice.Finally, ""Tea With Mussolini"" (1999) is a story about a young Italian boy being raised by American and English women. Cher co-stars with some of the most talented English women of all-time in this, including Joan Plowright, Judi Dench, and Maggie Smith. Lily Tomlin also co-stars.Simply, a fun entertaining box set that will please all Cher fans and just in time for the Holidays.",5,"""Cher...The Movie Actress""",1285718400,"09 29, 2010",2010,2292,"['Not', 'many', 'entertainers', 'can', 'say', 'have', 'done', 'Cher', 'exception', 'Singer', 'recording', 'artist', 'gay', 'icon', 'concert', 'performer', 'televison', 'personality', 'movie', 'actress', 'beautiful', 'box', 'set', 'world', 'Cher', 'varied', 'career', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'performances', '1960', 'late', ""'90"", 'really', 'neat', 'time', 'capsule', 'one', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'women', 'time.This', 'set', 'features', 'six', 'Cher', 'films', 'major', 'boxoffice', 'bombs', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'films', 'have', 'gone', 'be', 'loved', 'fans', 'critics', 'alike', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'really', 'unforgettable', 'Good', 'Times', '1967', 'Sonny', 'Cher', 'doing', 'spoofs', 'various', 'films', 'As', 'bad', 'one', 'Chasity', '1969', 'named', 'daughter', 'even', 'worse', 'Written', 'produced', 'Sonny', 'was', 'suppose', 'showcase', 'Cher', 'dramatic', 'capabilites', 'Instead', 'films', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'forgotten', 'were', 'terrible', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'potential', 'Cher', 'had', 'even', 'early', 'point', 'career', 'become', 'respected', 'sought-after', 'actress', 'evident', 'talent', 'was', 'there', 'material', 'was', 'non-existent.Next', 'have', 'Silkwood', '1983', 'major', 'movie', 'vehicle', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Cher', 'proved', 'could', 'act', 'best', 'actresses', 'hold', 'own', 'really', 'film', 'watching', 'Cher', 'forget', 'music', 'Bob', 'Mackie', 'costumes', 'persona', 'instead', 'see', 'future', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'toning', 'craft.Of', 'course', 'everyone', 'Moonstruck', '1987', 'movie', 'garnered', 'Cher', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'where', 'proved', 'everyone', 'even', 'Hollywood', 'naysayers', 'COULD', 'act', 'Sonny', 'Bono', 'told', 'day', 'Academy', 'Award', 'ceremony', 'was', 'going', 'win', 'obviously', 'always', 'knew', 'had', 'talent', 'Mermaids', '1990', 'Cher', 'fun', 'side', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'grossing', 'amazing', '80,000,000', 'boxoffice.Finally', 'Tea', 'Mussolini', '1999', 'story', 'young', 'Italian', 'boy', 'being', 'raised', 'American', 'English', 'women', 'co-stars', 'most', 'talented', 'English', 'women', 'all-time', 'including', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'also', 'co-stars.Simply', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'box', 'set', 'will', 'please', 'Cher', 'fans', 'just', 'time', 'Holidays']",Cher: The Film Collection (Good Times / Chastity / Silkwood / Moonstruck / Mermaids / Tea with Mussolini)
