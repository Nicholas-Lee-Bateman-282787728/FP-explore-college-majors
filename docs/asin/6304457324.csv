Robert Redford plays a man sick and tired of city life and (much like Dances With Wolves) finds himself alone in a ravaging frontier. He meets wild men in winter with skins on their back's, wild men in summer that have shaved their heads to keep their scalp, and a crazy woman that has lost all she has and taken upon with pitty. As humorous in stuggle as it is heartbreaking, Jeremiah Johnson stands tall with cinema's American Heroes. It can be listed with the &quot;Lone Man&quot; movies such as Rob Roy, Brave Heart, Dances With Wolves, and Last of the Mohican's. If you appreciate these mentioned films then you will most definately enjoy it. When he looses everything, and fight's alone against Braves one at a time, you will cheer his strength, and laugh at his attempts.

423263,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,6304457324,Andre Dursin,"[9, 11]","JEREMIAH JOHNSON is a rugged, exciting western-adventure starring Robert Redford as a disgruntled war veteran who decides to leave his life behind and become a mountain man in the wilds of 19th century Utah. His trials and tribulations, triumphs and tragedies are documented in a film that bridges an old-fashioned entertainment (with its Overture and Intermission) with a ""realistic"" tone typical of the `70s.Told with little dialogue (director Sydney Pollack referred to the picture as his ""silent movie""), ""Jeremiah Johnson"" is a tonic to the hyper-edited commercial product we see in the movies today. The film unfolds at a leisurely pace, emphasizing both the beauty and the danger of its natural surroundings; between Duke Callaghan's outstanding cinematography and the lyrical score of John Rubinstein and Tim McIntire (who took Pollack's suggestion and integrated vocals to give the film a mythic, ""ballad""-like feel), the movie is one of the most purely beautiful films of its era and one of the great ""outdoors"" movies in cinema history. The story is told in a somewhat disjointed manner, with the first half showing Jeremiah acclimating to the wild, inheriting a young boy from a settler family almost entirely massacred as well as a wife from a tribe of Christianized Indians; the second half, which starts after an Intermission at the 80 minute mark (keep in mind there's only 35 minutes left in the picture!), deals with Johnson's vendetta against the Crow tribe after his new, surrogate family perishes at their hands.The script - written by John Milius and Edward Anhalt with actual historical figures worked into the narrative - could have been better fleshed out in its latter stages, but this is still a tremendously impressive picture in spite of its flaws. Pollack, working with what he described as a skeleton crew in a virtual ""guerrilla filmmaking"" manner, shows his diversity as a filmmaker in a movie that was a far cry from his prior outing in ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" Mountain vistas, flowing streams, flying eagles and the living world have never felt so alive cinematically as they do here. Despite Redford's appearance, the film was produced on a tight budget - as Pollack mentions in his audio commentary, there wasn't enough money to hire a name composer, which is how Rubinstein and McIntire got the job. Problems with the early Panavision lenses and the harsh wintry conditions also lead to numerous difficulties making the film - yet the end result was well worth the trouble, as ""Jeremiah Johnson"" ranks as one of the most authentic, and satisfying, films of its genre. It's also a film that seems to improve with repeat viewing (knowing the film's shortcomings, it's easier to embrace its many positive attributes), a picture that embraces the natural world at a time when most studio fare seems completely disinterested in it.Warner's Blu-Ray edition of ""Jeremiah Johnson"" includes the debut of a commentary track, obviously recorded some time ago, with Pollack, Milius and Redford separately recounting their experiences working on the film. Pollack's insight is fascinating as he divulges the many challenges involved in the picture's production, with Milius and Redford also detailing the real-life history of Johnson himself. The trailer and the same vintage promotional featurette that were included on the old DVD are also on-hand here in standard-def. The 1080p AVC encoded transfer is generally excellent, showing fine detail with just a bit of DNR here and there. The 5.1 DTS MA soundtrack is even better, impressively mixed with the score flowing into all channels of the sound field.

423270,ALR35EFI69S5R,6304457324,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[17, 19]","If one can point to a single film that served to establish Robert Redford's credentials as a bankable movie star and a man willing to explore interesting and provocative stories and issues, it was this absorbing fact-based tale of a former U. S Army veteran turned reclusive mountain man named Jeremiah Johnson. The movie caused such a stir in the American west that when I lived there briefly in the mid 1970s, shortly after its theater release, there were many, many urban refugees making a stab at following Johnson's legendary example of a return to wild nature theme along Utah's Wasatch front. One would find mild mannered, longhaired, and heavily bearded young men with their well scrubbed blond haired women padding through the local Ogden, Utah supermarkets in their simple threadbare clothing, looking for basic provisions of Cheerios, Cheetos and California wine, climbing back into their muddy Jeep Renegades, and disappearing back into the wild places.The movie itself is a joy to experience, a travelogue of the Rocky Mountain West, with breath-taking vistas and wide-angled panoramas of the rugged mountain terrain providing a magnificent backdrop to the unfolding tale. Johnson (Redford) is fleeing what he regards the senseless futility of modern (circa 1850) civilization, preferring to live a life of true rugged individualism, and endeavoring to survive long enough to become a mountain man. In the midst of his feeble first attempts to do so, he encounters a wise old goat played beautifully by the late Will Geer, and through Geer's tutelage Johnson gradually evolves into a skilled and self-reliant practitioner of the art of bare-knuckled survival. And we come to care about his man who wants nothing so much as a more meaningful and more centered existence.Of course, there is trouble along the path to such a life, and the fractious interplay between arrogant soldiers and unpredictable Indians living in the mountains provide the coda to which his actions and eventual legend begins to unfold. Johnson gradually finds company both by way of a lovely and loving Indian woman, and an orphan he takes in after rampaging Indians murder the boy's family. One of the most interesting of the themes of the movie was the way in which the reasons, issues and  concerns of Native Americans are portrayed, so that one sees them more as the complex, intelligent, and complex people they were rather than as the cardboard villains Hollywood has characteristically painted them as being.In essence, this was an attempt by Redford to give a thought-provoking and thoughtful message about the nature of our culture and the importance of respect for different ways of living as well as different forms of culture, with his conclusion leaving us asking some important questions about prevailing cultural presumptions and the way we view ourselves and others.  I ask the viewer to watch the final frames carefully, as Johnson provides a friendly greeting to an Indian brave, providing the signal the long war between them is over, as they pass dangerously close to each other. Some less diligent viewers suggested, to Redford's intense later frustration, that he was giving the brave the finger! Redford shook his head in disbelief, wondering aloud how anyone could possibly come away with such a notion from what he had presented so well cinematically. All in all, a great film, and one I heartily recommend for your collection.

423287,A1W7JW829H45AE,6304457324,"Charles M. Strnad ""Washed up jock""","[4, 4]","First saw ""Jeremiah Johnson"" when it was released in the theatres in 1972-was captivated by it so much then that a friend of mine and I stayed in the largely empty theatre and sat through it a second time. Since 1972, I've probably rewatched this movie more often than any other, and after 35 years, I've come to the conclusion that what makes it one of my all-time favorite films is something more than the sum of its parts.The movie is only loosely based on the real-life exploits of John Garrison (aka John Johnson, maybe Johnston, but only Jeremiah in the movies), a legendary mountan man/trapper whose heyday was from about 1840 to 1880, before ""settling down"" and even becoming the sheriff of Red Lodge, Montana at the turn of the century. He died at age 72, and after initially being buried in a military cemetery in Los Angeles(he was a Civil War vet), was re-interred at his final resting place in Cody, Wyoming. Robert Redford served as one of his pall-bearers at his re-burial. I have researched Garrison/Johnson extensively since 1972, and it is perhaps final testimony to the legend that precious little (in the way of verifiable facts) is known about him; the real mountan men weren't around for publicity. The most cited book about his life ( ""Crow Killer"", by Raymond Thorpe) is widely considered hogwash for the most part, by the so-called modern expert historians of the Old West. But who's to say? It may well be that only the most unbelievable parts are true, and the legend may even be smaller than the real man. ""And some folks say....he's up there still.""Now, the movie, after 35 years of reflection, as to why I still watch it several times a year: it does suffer from not being seen on the big screen, as one of the stars of the movie is the Uintah Mountain scenery where it was mostly filmed. This is a movie of undeniable atmosphere, with sight and sound being paramount to its spell. And by sound I mean mostly the sparse, unsentimental lyrics of Tim McIntyre's songs, and the beautiful soundtrack, which enhances every scene. There is perhaps the least actual dialogue between principal characters that you will ever see in a film, but again, this adds to the ambiance of the High Lonely, and seems realistic for the time and sort of men these were. No tenderfoots here.The acting is first rate, and the casting spot-on as well. I have read that Redford himself has always considered ""Jeremiah Johnson"" one of his favorite roles, and it shows in his heart-felt performance. Acting without words most of the film, he is at his best.There are numerous memorable visual images from this gorgeously shot film, but perhaps the most lingering for me is of Johnson's steely face, viewed through the flames of his wilderness cabin as it burns away the remains of his wife, his adopted son, and his briefly happy existence in the wild. We know then that what will happen next ain't gonna be pretty.The story line roughly parallels what is known of the real Johnson's life, but again with a lot of Hollywood revisions, though the overall effect is still satisfying, and the story never drags or seems dull.But after saying all this, there are many other movies I've seen over the years that have some or all of these elements, but have failed to captivate me the way this movie has. And so it seems to me that the enduring quality of ""Jeremiah Johnson"" is more than the sum of its parts- and I think what that is, is an intense sense of LONGING that pervades this movie.....longing for something better, something more meaningful, something probably spiritual, to realize in this life. In Johnson's acerbic words' ""It oughter been DIFFERENT.""This is a great western classic, but in a very subdued, unique way. It will not appeal to everyone, even to many fans of the western genre. I'm not sure I even classify it as a western, myself. It's from that period of time when life was hard, but beautiful, and before the industrialization of the mind of man.....but it has a transcendent quality that will always make us want to go back.Only reason I only give it 4 stars is I wish it had been longer.Highly recommended, and nothing in it that I would be reluctant for my wife and kids to watch, either.",4,Still on my best list,1196812800,"12 5, 2007",2007,4217,"['First', 'saw', 'Jeremiah', 'Johnson', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theatres', '1972-was', 'captivated', 'so', 'much', 'then', 'friend', 'mine', 'stayed', 'largely', 'empty', 'theatre', 'sat', 'second', 'time', '1972', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'rewatched', 'movie', 'more', 'often', 'other', '35', 'years', ""'ve"", 'come', 'conclusion', 'what', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'films', 'something', 'more', 'sum', 'parts.The', 'movie', 'only', 'loosely', 'based', 'real-life', 'exploits', 'John', 'Garrison', 'aka', 'John', 'Johnson', 'maybe', 'Johnston', 'only', 'Jeremiah', 'movies', 'legendary', 'mountan', 'man/trapper', 'heyday', 'was', '1840', '1880', 'settling', 'down', 'even', 'becoming', 'sheriff', 'Red', 'Lodge', 'Montana', 'turn', 'century', 'died', 'age', '72', 'initially', 'being', 'buried', 'military', 'cemetery', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'was', 'Civil', 'War', 'vet', 'was', 're-interred', 'final', 'resting', 'place', 'Cody', 'Wyoming', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'served', 'one', 'pall-bearers', 're-burial', 'have', 'researched', 'Garrison/Johnson', 'extensively', '1972', 'perhaps', 'final', 'testimony', 'legend', 'precious', 'little', 'way', 'verifiable', 'facts', 'known', 'real', 'mountan', 'men', 'were', ""n't"", 'around', 'publicity', 'most', 'cited', 'book', 'life', 'Crow', 'Killer', 'Raymond', 'Thorpe', 'widely', 'considered', 'hogwash', 'most', 'part', 'so-called', 'modern', 'expert', 'historians', 'Old', 'West', 'who', 'say', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'only', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'parts', 'are', 'true', 'legend', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'smaller', 'real', 'man', 'folks', 'say', '.he', 'there', 'still', 'Now', 'movie', '35', 'years', 'reflection', 'why', 'still', 'watch', 'several', 'times', 'year', 'suffer', 'not', 'being', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'one', 'stars', 'movie', 'Uintah', 'Mountain', 'scenery', 'where', 'was', 'mostly', 'filmed', 'movie', 'undeniable', 'atmosphere', 'sight', 'sound', 'being', 'paramount', 'spell', 'sound', 'mean', 'mostly', 'sparse', 'unsentimental', 'lyrics', 'Tim', 'McIntyre', 'songs', 'beautiful', 'soundtrack', 'scene', 'perhaps', 'least', 'actual', 'dialogue', 'principal', 'characters', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'film', 'again', 'ambiance', 'High', 'Lonely', 'realistic', 'time', 'sort', 'men', 'were', 'tenderfoots', 'here.The', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'casting', 'spot-on', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'read', 'Redford', 'always', 'considered', 'Jeremiah', 'Johnson', 'one', 'favorite', 'roles', 'heart-felt', 'performance', 'Acting', 'words', 'most', 'film', 'are', 'numerous', 'memorable', 'visual', 'images', 'gorgeously', 'shot', 'film', 'perhaps', 'most', 'lingering', 'Johnson', 'steely', 'face', 'viewed', 'flames', 'wilderness', 'cabin', 'away', 'remains', 'wife', 'adopted', 'son', 'briefly', 'happy', 'existence', 'wild', 'know', 'then', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'be', 'pretty.The', 'story', 'line', 'roughly', 'parallels', 'what', 'known', 'real', 'Johnson', 'life', 'again', 'lot', 'Hollywood', 'revisions', 'overall', 'effect', 'still', 'satisfying', 'story', 'never', 'dull.But', 'saying', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'have', 'elements', 'have', 'failed', 'captivate', 'way', 'movie', 'enduring', 'quality', 'Jeremiah', 'Johnson', 'more', 'sum', 'parts-', 'think', 'what', 'intense', 'sense', 'LONGING', 'movie', '..longing', 'something', 'better', 'something', 'more', 'meaningful', 'something', 'probably', 'spiritual', 'realize', 'life', 'Johnson', 'acerbic', 'words', 'oughter', 'been', 'DIFFERENT', 'great', 'western', 'classic', 'very', 'subdued', 'unique', 'way', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'even', 'many', 'fans', 'western', 'genre', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'even', 'classify', 'western', 'period', 'time', 'when', 'life', 'was', 'hard', 'beautiful', 'industrialization', 'mind', 'man', 'transcendent', 'quality', 'will', 'always', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'back.Only', 'reason', 'only', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'longer.Highly', 'recommended', 'nothing', 'would', 'be', 'reluctant', 'wife', 'kids', 'watch']",N/A

Living in near complete isolation, subsisting almost entirely off the land, enjoying the best while often surviving (sometimes not) the worst nature has to offer...the idea of escaping civilization, throwing off the shackles of conventionalism, and communing with nature can be an appealing I suppose, but it would never work for me if for but one reason...I surely do enjoy my indoor plumbing...and toilet paper...adapted from two sources (a novel called ""Mountain Man"" by Vardis Fisher and a story titled ""Crow Killer"" by Raymond W. Thorp and Robert Bunker) by John Milius (Apocalypse Now, Conan the Barbarian) and Edward Anhalt (Panic in the Streets), the film was directed by Academy Award winning producer/actor/director Sydney Pollack (Tootsie, Out of Africa), and is the second of six films he worked on in some manner with Academy Award winner Robert Redford (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting), who also stars as the title character.  Also appearing is Will Geer (Winchester '73, The President's Analyst), who's probably familiar to most as 'Grandpa' Zebulon Walton from the TV series ""The Waltons"", Stefan Gierasch (High Plains Drifter, Cornbread, Earl and Me), Josh Albee (Oliver Twist), Allyn Ann McLerie (They Shoot Horses, Don't They?), Joaqu&iacute;n Mart&iacute;nez (Joe Kidd), and Delle Bolton, in her one and only silver screen appearance.Set in the mid 1800s, the story begins as we meet, through narration, a character named Jeremiah Johnson (Redford), ""a man of proper wit and adventurous spirit suited to the mountains"".  His manner of dress indicates he was once in the army, but apparently no longer as he arrives in a frontier town, looking to outfit himself and head off into the Rocky Mountains, leaving behind all the trapping of civilized man, to which he does.  Extremely hard times follow, but Johnson finds a friend (and perhaps kindred spirit) in a fellow mountain man named Bear Claw Chris Lapp (Geer), who takes him in and teaches Johnson enough to get by...the two eventually split up (a mountain man is a solitary creature), and Johnson eventually finds himself saddled with a mute boy (one of two settlers who survived an attack by some unfriendly Native Americans), and a Native American wife named Swan (Bolton), given to him as an honor by a local tribe (they thought he a great warrior for killing some of their enemies, those in a neighboring tribe).  This family phase doesn't last too long as Johnson is enlisted by some gooberment types to help them locate a lost settler party, the only way to reach them by trespassing across sacred Native American lands, and thusly gains some powerful enemies who hound him on a continual basis... ""some say he's dead...some say he never will be...""Apparently the character of Jeremiah Johnson was actually based on a real person named John Johnston aka Crow Killer aka Liver Eater Johnston (his nicknames came about due to a long standing feud with a tribe known as the Crow, and his penchant for cutting their livers out and eating them...lovely).  I'm not familiar with the individual, but I really enjoyed the movie, despite a sense of romanticism infused within the story here...I can't help but feel the actual man Redford's character was based on to be much different, much more `mountainy', less `Robert Redford', but regardless (Redford actually did a lot of his own stunt work, but being the hell of a guy he is, not wanting to put anyone out of work, insisted the production still paid his stunt double what he would have gotten if Redford hadn't done the dangerous stunts himself)...two things that stuck out in my mind after watching this film...one, the exquisitely beautiful backdrop of the Utah landscape throughout (some of the film was shot on Redford's expansive Utah estate...must be nice), and two, how little actual dialog there was in this nearly two hour film.  Pollack and Redford present here an engaging story, full of interesting characters, framed against gorgeous backgrounds.  The story, to me, was essentially broken down into three parts, the first being Johnson's indoctrination into being a mountain man (stripping away much of his `civilized' accoutrements), the second his family phase, and then thirdly going it alone again...by the end of the film I found myself asking if his trials and hardships were worth it, but then realized those weren't actually applicable questions because Redford's character didn't have a choice.  Yes, he chose to leave behind his life among men and cities, but it was a decision based on an intense desire from within to live life on his own terms and survive the dangerous of the wilderness based on his own abilities.  Even now I wouldn't understand his specific choice to live amongst the trees, critters and such, but I do understand the idea of actually living a life worth living, the rewards enjoyed from going your own way, doing what feels natural and right within yourself...many people never find this desire, and thus never experience the harmonious totality of completely freeing ones spirit.  Does that make sense?  Perhaps not, but it came through in the story for me...my favorite sequence in the film was near the beginning as Johnson became friends with the older trapper called Bear Claw, played by Geer...the two men were out hunting and Bear Claw was showing him how to use a  horse as cover (hide behind it) when hunting elk.  Johnson asks ""Won't he see my feet?"" to which Bear Claw replies ""Elk don't know how many feet a horse has!""  It was much funnier in the film, only because the delivery of the lines is as important as the lines themselves.Warner Brothers provides the fullscreen (Pan & Scan) and widescreen (2.35:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, picture formats on this DVD, both of which look excellent, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround audio comes through very clear and strong.  There are some special features including cast and crew bios/filmographies, video liner notes for the film, a theatrical trailer, a featurette titled `The Saga of Jeremiah Johnson"", and some Reel Reccomendations, which are pretty silly, as they're supposed to be recommendations made towards one liking this film, but are really just Warner Brothers touting whatever DVD releases they had at the time...I mean really, how in the world do they link this film with Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995)?  I did, as others, thought it was unnecessary that studio include the intermission segment on this DVD release, but if they hadn't, someone would have complained about its exclusion, especially if it was present in the original theatrical release...I guess, if anything, it offered me the chance to get up and take a leak without actually having to push the pause button on the DVD player remote...Cookieman108By the way, if'n some old mountain man ever asks you if you know how to skin griz while following him into his cabin, just say no, you surely don't...",5,"""Where you headed?""

423294,AUHG8KSHI529U,6304457324,Craig Matteson,"[5, 5]","It is hard to believe this movie is now more than thirty years old.  I watched it last night with my youngest son who is just starting to camp out with his scout troop.  He enjoyed this movie a great deal and it does have a lot to offer a young man about learning the skills of the outdoors.  It is also so effective in making outdoor life, even in the winter, so appealing that millions of city folk like me grow almost wistful of the ""pure life"" in the mountains.  This is in spite of having experienced all the joy there is in sleeping out in a winter storm at ten below zero with frozen hands and feet.  This is the power of the dream over experience.This tale is based upon the experiences of a real trapper named Joe Johnson, but this is clearly a fable.  Jeremiah comes from where we don't know, he wants to live in the mountains, but is clearly unprepared.  He struggles and is spared by an Indian and saved by a kindly old mountain man named Bear Claw.  Soon he becomes a skilled mountain man and through no fault of his own he becomes a fierce and feared fighter.Even though there are some extended fight scenes and images that were considered somewhat shocking when the film came out, they all seem pretty tame today, but are still effective.  The movie is actually very quiet and even melancholy rather than violent.  There are some very humorous scenes and scenes of compassion and tenderness that do balance out the action sequences and delineate how brutal life in the wild could be.Robert Redford does a fine job of holding the camera with few words and keeping everything interesting and moving along.  The director, Sydney Pollack and the film editor should get a great deal of credit.  Their choice of music has held up pretty well, even if it does sound like the 70's faux folk western music it is.  But many films from the eighties have scores that sound much more dated.The supporting cast does a fine job.  Some of them are only on screen for a few minutes, but remain indelibly in our memories (Allyn Ann McLerie as the crazy woman or Stefan Gierasch as Del Gue are only two examples).The movie is also visually beautiful.

423297,A2GYX971VETQBV,6304457324,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[9, 9]","JEREMIAH JOHNSON is a film that unwinds much like an old folk song or urban legend.  For much of its length, I thought I was being treated to a tragedy concerning a man who leaves everything behind to begin life anew in the mountains.  But in the end, the ultimate mark of tragedy escapes our protagonist and the rest of the film plays out like a tall-tale.  Instead, JEREMIAH JOHNSON offers a humanizing portrait of a man whose hunting & fighting prowess earn him regional fame and legendary status.  But Robert Redford's performance is not one of an over-the-top, larger-than-life character who wrestles the elements with his bare hands.  On the contrary, Redford paints a rather humble portrait of a man driven by emotion and passion, the depths of which we never quite get to glimpse during the film's two hours.  He is a man whom fame is thrust upon rather than sought.The storyline is the kind that America thrives upon: a mixture of societal rebellion and ""coming of age.""  The metaphors are endless.  It is the story of a man who just will not quit, despite all of the hardships he must overcome in his transition to the wild.  In fact, this transition is important to dwell upon for a moment.  Many films have painted the story of one's transition from nature to society, from crude to cultured.  But JEREMIAH JOHNSON tells the opposite tale of a man who is ascending to some kind of original harmony with nature.  And rather than a regression or a descent back to simplicity, it truly is a story of graduation.  There are a couple of points in the film when Redford's character receives acceptance from Native American tribes.  These scenes are critical to the film's success, as they suggest the acceptance of Redford by the mountain, nature, and life.  And it is this acceptance that grabs the audience because we all seek this sort of acceptance in our own way.All praise aside, the image quality on this DVD is pretty bad.  I thought I was watching VHS for a moment and had to adjust to the screen (it has been a while since I have seen a video cassette).  Why they didn't touch this film up is beyond me.  I would have granted it four stars, but I am subtracting one for the image quality and because the film (while engaging) is a bit slow in several parts and could have been more effectively edited.  If you like visually stunning films about the wild, you will love JEREMIAH JOHNSON.  It is a modern folk tale: part truth, part magic.

Yet there are these little drawbacks:  like blizzards; life-threatening cold; wild critters; haunting isolation.  And two centuries ago, there were several Indian tribes who didn't look all too kindly on their ancient lands being infiltrated by trappers, traders, and eventually settlers.  So it's not exactly Paradise, yet still appealing to a young man named Jeremiah Johnson, who is fed up with 'civilization' (for unknown reasons) and seeks a solitary existence up in the mountains.  Nice premise for a story--even a film; enter JEREMIAH JOHNSON.This film is the wonderful collaboration between Robert Redford and the late, great director Sydney Pollack.  Redford furnishes character--from a naive 'pilgrim' who almost perishes in the harsh wilderness, to a hardened killer--Pollack furnishes setting and unbelievably gorgeous vistas.  This is a beautiful film--yet like the Rockies themselves it is also brutal and hard.  I also enjoyed several of the other characters, and their interactions with Redford's character; Will Geer (better known as Grandpa in the TV series 'The Waltons') and Stefan Gierasch (who we get to meet buried up to his mustaches in the dirt) particularly come to mind.  These actors lend rich authenticity to the mountain man persona, and they are darn fun to watch.And like the Rockies, this movie also has some drawbacks.  The story, at times, flowed unevenly--almost awkwardly--and much of the music was just plain hokey.  Yet these slight flaws are not enough to take away from JEREMIAH JOHNSON--a grand tale of a mountain man turning into a legend.--D.

423315,A1X9OJN30EBE3M,6304457324,Dr. Karl O. Edwards,"[151, 169]","This review is for the DVD version of ""Jeremiah Johnson"" released October 30, 2007.November 3, 2013:  I have just finished viewing the Blu-ray version and it is by far the best version I have seen.  Hence, I strongly recommend that you purchase the Blu-ray version if you have a player.Have you ever dreamed of living in the wilderness, on your own, or being a mountain man? If so, ""Jeremiah Johnson"" is the movie for you; if not, the film just may change your mind. I was going to the University of Utah when ""Jeremiah Johnson"" was filmed, and was easily lured into reading ""Crow Killer: The Saga of Liver-Eating Johnson"" by Raymond W. Thorp and Robert Bunker (1958), and ""Mountain Man"" by Vardis Fisher (1965). Being a history major and researcher by nature, I did not stop there. I read many journal and newspaper articles, and a few rare documents that mentioned the man I learned was born in New Jersey with the name John Garrison. As much as I love Utah, I was dismayed by the fact that the real John Johnston spent most of his life in Montana, and as a resident of Montana (and someone who has lived in places where Johnston lived), I can assure you that the geography is very different. In particular, the Lolo and Flathead Valleys where the Flathead Indians lived are lush, rich, productive lands--not barren rocks and bushes as depicted in the movie. None-the-less, I went to see ""Jeremiah Johnson"" with an open mind--and loved the movie. Why? Because in the final analysis, ""Jeremiah Johnson"" has little to nothing to do with the historical figure the movie is allegedly based upon.With this fact in mind, I suggest that you look at the Wikipedia listing and [...] for more ""factual"" information about the historical John Johnston. I will address the main character of the film, the fictional Jeremiah Johnson, and the ""historical"" attributes portrayed in the film. As for the books, I can only say this: ""Mountain Man"" is a beautifully romantic fictional story, but there are better non-fiction books available. ""Crow-Killer"" is a comical read for anyone who knows a thing about mountain men, but is otherwise a farce.In 1979, seven years after ""Jeremiah Johnson"" was released, I met John Arlee, the Native American technical adviser for the show, and an uncredited actor who played the role of the Flathead Indian that did the translating. When I met John, he was presiding over a ceremony as a Flathead medicine man. Since then, John, who is fluent in the Flathead dialect of the Salish language, has gone on to author several (educational) books and teach Salish at the Salish-Kutenai College in Pablo, Montana. His stories--which are not mine to share--about making the movie are gems, and would make a great read themselves. But John was quite proud of his part in the film, and the accuracy he brought to it concerning Flathead culture (all be it, some 10-12 hours south of where it should have been filmed). Having done little study of the Flathead or any Salish speaking group prior to working with John, I was very pleased to learn that Flathead Indian scenes of the ""Jeremiah Johnson"" were done as well as can be expected for a big budget film.As time has passed, and I have learned more, I have come to appreciate the realities of the 20 year vendetta with the ""Crow"" Indians portrayed in ""Jeremiah Johnson."" [Please note that I am using the more familiar term used to refer to this nation of people, rather than their own word, ""Aps&aacute;alooke""]. First and foremost, one must understand that the Crows have a matriarchal clan family social structure. As with many societies that have clan structures, offenses and accolades towards any clan member are made to the clan head. While I have found no definitive evidence that Johnston or any of the Crow clans had a vendetta with each other, there are ""stories"" (with limited depth) that there was some sort of ""disagreement"" between Johnston and one of the (Mountain) Crow clans. If such were the case, it would have played out as depicted in ""Jeremiah Johnson,"" with individual Crow members seeking retribution for Johnson's act of killing the ""war"" party that killed his wife. For the Crow, there would be no logical connection between their having killed Johnson's wife (and the fictitious boy in the movie) and Johnson's killing of those men. When the Crows killed Johnson's wife, they were killing an enemy--an act of ""war""; when Johnson kills the Crows--from the Crow perspective--Johnson is committing murder, not war. Thus Johnson started a ""feud"" with the clan(s) of those he killed.While the language in the film may be objectionable to some, I feel that it is used sparingly and is appropriate to the attitude of the film; just as the jargon of the mountain men is used minimally, but effectively. And while I have had no experience with re-inactors of mountain men, my sense is that what little information is shown in the film (e.g., using coals to keep warm at night) are well, if not accurately, portrayed. One must remember that mountain men were for the most part people that did not give two hoots about anybody--including themselves--and lived life as they saw fit. Their customs and mannerisms were their own; everyone else be damned. And, most mountain men, contrary to what many may be believe, shared little with the ""fur trappers"" and explorers of the times; let alone the ""settlers."" Most mountain men, in fact, preferred Native Americans and their way of life, which lead to their inclusion of being labeled with the pejorative, demeaning, and insulting phrase ""squaw men."" [""Squaw"" has a very poor etiology, with most non-Native Americans believing that it is a prototype word that was ""common"" to most Indian tribes for woman, while many others use the Iroquois definition: vagina (or, more correctly, an obscene reference to vagina). Hence, ""squaw man"" would really mean ""a man who likes vagina.""]In the movie, Jeremiah Johnson is clearly a loner--and he likes it that way. Yes, he spends time trading with various Indians, but he has learned a lesson the hard way: when he helped the ""low landers"" find the missing wagons (I could never figure out why they knew where they were but could not get back there) his actions led him to commit fatal mistakes. First he left his wife (and the boy) alone, then he led the ""search party"" through sacred ground, which he himself believed was VERY wrong, and then he vented his self anger at the closest group of people he could find. Please note that the movie never makes it clear that the party of Crows he kills are the same people that killed his wife! All of these actions were contrary to those of a typical mountain man; of course building the cabin was too.But in the final analysis, ""Jeremiah Johnson"" is just too good of a movie to really complain about--especially if one gets over the fact that it really has nothing to do with the historical figure, John Johnston, other than the film makers make reference to the two books as ""source material."" I would argue that the fact that in the end the movie was called ""Jeremiah Johnson"" and not ""Liver-Eaten Johnson"" is evidence that the film makers wanted to make a romantic film about mountain men, not a story of one man. If you have not seen ""Jeremiah Johnson"" you are missing one of the greatest movies ever made. It is tremendously engrossing and entertaining; but I would not recommend it for children. If you like the outdoors, ""Jeremiah Johnson"" will have you dreaming of your next outing.For those of you wanting the ""real"" dirt--what is the difference between this version and the ""cheaper"" version--it is the casing that the DVD comes in! The cheap one is in the older cardboard type box, this one is in a hard plastic box. Unfortunately, the disc is still double sided (full and wide screen versions), and the ""bonus"" features are the same. (Yes, I have both versions.) More important to me is that any hopes of a ""directors"" cut seem to have been lost, since Sydney Pollack has recently passed away. The fake intro and intermission--that were not part of any of the theatrical showings I attended--had given me some hope that there might be some additional scenes, but that was not the case. I am not even sure that I can truly tell the difference between the DVD and VHS versions I have, other than the tape is getting old.Please Note: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews. My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments. So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.

423329,A73DFWJE0CGY6,6304457324,"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee""","[11, 12]","There is a poetry to this movie that has stayed with me - from the first time I ever saw it, when it first came out. From the haunting strains of Indian flutes as we first see the ferry bringing Jeremiah to the first stop in his new life - a trading post outfitting those intrepid or crazy enough to disappear into the wild - to the end, when he has weathered more than anyone today probably could survive, we are absorbed into a world that will never be possible again. Trappers routinely sleep in deep snow without tents and without freezing to death; a mountain man, mauled by a bear and incapacitated, calmly writes out his last will and testament, leaving his rifle to ""whutever finds it - Lord hope it be a White man"", and freezes to a tree; another mountain man shaves his head to prevent himself being scalped.This film deserves classic status. Even the language used herein is measured and syntaxed to approximate the way the English language was spoken in the 1830s, and its exact and proper nature is almost a dialect of its own. I nearly likened it to Elizabethan, but that's obviously wrong; it's just that the flavour of the speech is like watching a play in some respects.There isn't, actually, a LOT of dialog; enough for the drama to be established, and certainly enough when required; but the story is the man, who is alone more often than not. Jeremiah Johnson, a youngish man at the start of the story, suffers some never-explained falling-out with civilization and literally heads to the hills, with no wilderness skills but plenty of nerve. He is having a rough go of it - his ineptitude earns him a bye from a Crow warrior, who observes his pathetic attempts at fishing and either is too amused or too disgusted (or both) to deal harshly with the intruder into his territory - until he is rescued shortly before starving to death by a crusty old mountain man out looking for ""griz"". The older man takes Jeremiah into his cabin and instructs him on all aspects of being a mountain man, and having learned well, Jeremiah goes out on his own.This movie is based on real people; the trader Jeremiah sees at the beginning, Roubideau, actually had a post - I've been to the spot of at least one of his stores, and it's remote now; I can't imagine how vulnerable people felt then, when there was real danger of disaster at such places. Jeremiah Johnson was created on a man called ""Liver-Eating"" Johnson, a real person who took it out on the Crow Nation for killing his wife by - you guessed it - supposedly killing Crow warriors and eating their livers. In this movie, the battle is joined one warrior at a time.""Lucky they're Crow,"" Del Gue, another mountain man, says after a nighttime encounter. ""Apache's 'd send 50 at once"".My theatre teacher in college used Robert Redford as an example of an actor who uses facial expression in lieu of verbal extrapolation in acting, and it is especially apparent here, with so little dialog in the first place. He is aided in this by the fact that two of his closest companions are a mute boy and a woman who speaks no English; he learns by osmosis to communicate nonverbally, to a large extent. The few others he encounters in his wanderings are the larger-than-life mountain men, a crazy woman - mother of the mute boy, she and he are the only survivors of an Indian attack on the family; she ultimately forces Jeremiah to take the boy with him when he happens upon their cabin - and a troop of cavalrymen who prove to be his undoing.The movie in the first part is fairly straightforward; Jeremiah becomes a mountain man, establishes alliances with other mountain men and with some Indian tribes (including, at first, the same Crow warrior who saw his attempts at fishing early on) and even marries into the Flathead tribe, and builds a cabin on the Musselshell River, in the interests of living there in harmony with the native population. Along comes the cavalry, strongarming him into guiding them to a stranded wagon train. This angers the Crow Nation,who resent the intrusion of white militia in their territory, and the last half of the movie deals with Jeremiah's one-man war with them after they kill his wife and the mute boy in his absence.A lot of this movie is the scenery, which was at least partially filmed on Redford's ranch (one way to keep expenses down). There is one scene of him chopping down a tree - I do not think I have ever seen a sky so blue. You can nearly smell the pine needles as you watch; feel the cold; taste the sweetness of the wild water. During one of the one-on-one battles with a warrior, the sound of an elk trumpeting in the distance brings an eerie accent to the scene.I come back to this movie again and again. It is a beautiful homage to an indomitable spirit, done in a drop-dead gorgeous natural setting.

423330,A2MF338Q12XI3H,6304457324,Frank Bierbrauer,"[4, 5]","One of the few films of the western genre which are not mythical depictions of speculative history which was so prevalent right up to the last 30 years or so. Forget the usual films such as &quot;Shane&quot;, most John Wayne films, the spaghetti westerns etc etc, this is a great film. There is so much to recommend it not least of which the acting of Robert Redford in the lead role as the mountain man. There is so much more : the soundtrack which is often bleak and minimalist, this is done for a reason, and then the occasional songs sung by a man seemingly lonely and in the wilderness far from any help or sanctuary. The photography is like Ansell Adams did it, just sublime, I can only remember &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; doing this as well.In my view the best western I've seen with only &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; better but then that is an experience rather than a film. Robert Redford plays the man attempting a new life in the mountains through trapping and hunting which he plays in a very understated fashion, his trials and tribulations are seen on his face and they are real, the violence is real; no fake fights in saloons here. His confrontation with other highly suspect characters is excellent and his building a cabin in the secluded area of the Rockies. He marries the daughter of a chief but against his better judgement leads a party of troops, who need to get to a group of stranded settlers, through a Crow burial ground. Of course the movements were witnessed by the Crow and his wife is murdered, on his return which he hurries along because of an internal feeling for what has happened, he undergoes tragic suffering and the terrible desire for revenge. He tracks the responsible warriors, about 5 or 6 of them, and massacres the lot. This is when his life really becomes hard, the Crow send a warrior to hunt him down, each time a single man. Through desperation and a need for survival he defeats each man in turn, not without being severely wounded. In one incredible scene he meets an old friend who taught him the ways of a trapper and as they are sitting down to eat he is surprised by a warrior hidden in leaves right next to the camp. A short battle ensues which he survives and his friend asks him something like : &quot;you are in a lot of trouble&quot;, he answers in those now epic words : &quot;trouble, what trouble&quot;.The film is so rich in everyting that makes a human being that no other words than &quot;see this movie&quot; need be said.",5,The film is so rich in everyting that makes a human being,975974400,"12 5, 2000",2000,2497,"['One', 'few', 'films', 'western', 'genre', 'are', 'not', 'mythical', 'depictions', 'speculative', 'history', 'was', 'so', 'prevalent', 'right', 'up', 'last', '30', 'years', 'so', 'Forget', 'usual', 'films', 'such', 'quot', 'Shane', 'quot', 'most', 'John', 'Wayne', 'films', 'spaghetti', 'etc', 'etc', 'great', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'recommend', 'not', 'least', 'acting', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'lead', 'role', 'mountain', 'man', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'soundtrack', 'often', 'bleak', 'minimalist', 'done', 'reason', 'then', 'occasional', 'songs', 'sung', 'man', 'seemingly', 'lonely', 'wilderness', 'far', 'help', 'sanctuary', 'photography', 'Ansell', 'Adams', 'did', 'just', 'sublime', 'can', 'only', 'remember', 'quot', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'quot', 'doing', 'well.In', 'view', 'best', 'western', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'only', 'quot', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'quot', 'better', 'then', 'experience', 'rather', 'film', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'man', 'attempting', 'new', 'life', 'mountains', 'trapping', 'hunting', 'very', 'understated', 'fashion', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'are', 'seen', 'face', 'are', 'real', 'violence', 'real', 'fake', 'fights', 'saloons', 'here', 'confrontation', 'other', 'highly', 'suspect', 'characters', 'excellent', 'building', 'cabin', 'secluded', 'area', 'Rockies', 'daughter', 'chief', 'better', 'judgement', 'party', 'troops', 'who', 'need', 'get', 'group', 'stranded', 'settlers', 'Crow', 'burial', 'ground', 'course', 'movements', 'were', 'witnessed', 'Crow', 'wife', 'murdered', 'return', 'internal', 'feeling', 'what', 'happened', 'tragic', 'suffering', 'terrible', 'desire', 'revenge', 'responsible', 'warriors', 'about', '5', '6', 'lot', 'when', 'life', 'really', 'hard', 'Crow', 'send', 'warrior', 'hunt', 'down', 'time', 'single', 'man', 'desperation', 'need', 'survival', 'man', 'turn', 'not', 'being', 'severely', 'wounded', 'one', 'incredible', 'scene', 'old', 'friend', 'who', 'taught', 'ways', 'trapper', 'are', 'sitting', 'down', 'eat', 'surprised', 'warrior', 'hidden', 'leaves', 'right', 'next', 'camp', 'short', 'battle', 'ensues', 'friend', 'something', 'quot', 'are', 'lot', 'trouble', 'quot', 'now', 'epic', 'words', 'quot', 'trouble', 'what', 'trouble', 'quot', '.The', 'film', 'so', 'rich', 'everyting', 'human', 'being', 'other', 'words', 'quot', 'see', 'movie', 'quot', 'be', 'said']",N/A

423333,AY12DBB0U420B,6304457324,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's DVD movie was ""Jeremiah Johnson"" and it came as something of a surprise. First, I'd never heard of the story or the movie and, second, it was essentially a one-man show starring Robert Redford. Jeremiah was a disgruntled former soldier who decided to leave civilization and become a self-sustained mountain man. So he headed for the Rockies and turned left ending up in the semi-desert of Utah. The setting was beautiful and the photography was excellent. I'd almost say that the scenery was a movie in itself. In any case, Johnson's story recounted the early struggling days where he finally met a trapper and became more adept at survival. Next, he befriended a distraught woman who had lost her husband and a son. He ""adopts"" a second son, who never speaks, to accompany him on his travels. Then he was awarded a Crow Indian wife who couldn't speak English so it made for a somewhat strange family. They settle down, but not for long as his adopted son and wife were murdered. Afterwards, Johnson burned his homestead to the ground and went on a long revenge streak.The story is simple and straight forward, but lends a strong feeling of deep sadness throughout the movie. It was not an easy life Jeremiah Johnson chose and was marred by numerous tragic events. Nevertheless, meld the sad and tragic story with the beautiful mountainous scenery and you have a rather compelling movie that doesn't offer many lapses in attention. All of the acting is first rate, and to me, this was the best acting by Robert Redford that I've witnessed.

It presents appealing scenery, an interesting story, good acting, and a rare look into the reality of the early 1800's American mountain man.The film is brutal at times, wholesome at others, and keeps you guessing by not knowing what is next and or when his life reaches a final, peaceful phase, through the film's habit of appearing to end when it's not.  But the story does conclude with Johnson earning his place in the wilderness and the respect of the local Crow Indian tribe.  Even in the lonely wilderness of the west man needs the company of others to survive, as Johnson find out.  And as the old wise trapper teaches him, humans are as territorial as the great Grizzlies of the wild, and thus the native tribes whom he is forced to deal with.The DVD is suprisingly well done despite it's somewhat bland packaging.

423341,ASO82SSUBBOH3,6304457324,Hank Robbins,"[0, 0]","This is a very fine film and one of Robert Redford's better performances.  He stars as Jeremiah Johnson, a man who leaves &quot;civilized&quot; America to find himself in the harsh and hostile area of the Rocky  Mountains and becomes a mountain man.  This film is far too short for my  tastes and could have had an ending with more closure, and hence only the 4  stars.  If the characters, action scenes and humor were not as stellar as  they are, I would have rated it perhaps as a 2.  Johnson, in his travels  meets up with friendly and hostile Indians, sage and crazy mountain men,  and even takes a wife and adopts a child; all of these events and  &quot;novel creations&quot; truly &quot;make&quot; this film.  The movie's  strong suit, aside from Redford, is its thematic portrayal of how Johnson  succeeds in becoming a legend in his own time amongst the tribes in the  Rockies.  There is a fine action-montage sequence near the end of the film  that is truly stirring and exciting and should have been made longer.  In  all, a fine film which, despite pitfalls, more than makes up for its  failings with fine acting,  and excellent plot and characters.

With new skills learned from his mentor, Jeremiah strikes out on his own. Along the way, he becomes encumbered with a &quot;family&quot; - a small white boy essentially orphaned by an Indian raid, and a native wife more or less forced on him by her brother, a friendly Flathead Indian chief. In time, he learns to love them both - an emotional investment for which he pays dearly after a band of Crow Indians retaliates for a major social faux pas that Johnson commits while helping an Army cavalry detachment rescue a party of snow-bound pioneers. From that point, revenge takes over on a tit for tat basis. The ending is perhaps a lesson for the Israelis and Palestinians, or the Catholics and Protestants of Northern Ireland, on how to end for both sides what is otherwise a no-win situation.Filmed on location in the Rockies, JEREMIAH JOHNSON is a scenic and powerful contribution to the Western genre of filmmaking. It does particularly well in depicting the lonely solitude lived by the American mountain man of yore. Redford's portrayal of a regular guy just trying to get along and survive is beyond reproach. As a matter of fact, I think it's one of the better roles he's played in his career. Nowadays, when Westerns aren't as much in vogue as they used to be, perhaps the film is worth another look.

Bowie was well over six feet tall in his stocking feet; some say six foot five.But Redford came through with flying colors, although the screen writers left out many fascinating details of Johnson's (originally Johnston) exciting life.  The movie was filmed in the wilds of Utah, and filming began before the script was finished.  Weather was a huge problem, as well, and the studio never spent enough money and effort promoting it, but still it did very well at the box-office, eventually.Driving through Montana and northern Wyoming several years ago, we passed Crazy Woman Mountain, which I think was probably named after Mrs. Morgan (in the story), whose family was killed by Crows (as was Johnson's); hence his killing spree.This is a movie well worth seeing.  It is not only entertaining, but the Utah scenery is delightful, and there is even a little insight into the actual hardships of the real Mountain Men of the Rockies, Sierras, Cascades and Blue Mountains of the West.Joseph (Joe) Pierre",5,&quot;Liver Eating&quot; Johnson's story,1081987200,"04 15, 2004",2004,1434,"['highly', 'fictionalized', 'story', 'real', 'Mountain', 'Man', 'nom-de-plume', 'was', 'quot', 'Liver', 'Eating', 'quot', 'Johnson', 'so-called', 'habitually', 'ate', 'livers', 'Crow', 'Indians', 'killed', 'vendetta', 'them.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'casting', 'Redford', 'Johnson', 'almost', 'as', 'ridiculous', 'casting', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'Jim', 'Bowie', 'old', 'movie', 'Iron', 'Mistress', 'same', 'reason', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'was', 'shrimp', 'Bowie', 'was', 'well', 'six', 'feet', 'tall', 'stocking', 'feet', 'say', 'six', 'foot', 'five.But', 'Redford', 'came', 'flying', 'colors', 'screen', 'writers', 'left', 'out', 'many', 'fascinating', 'details', 'Johnson', 'originally', 'Johnston', 'exciting', 'life', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'wilds', 'Utah', 'filming', 'began', 'script', 'was', 'finished', 'Weather', 'was', 'huge', 'problem', 'as', 'well', 'studio', 'never', 'spent', 'enough', 'money', 'effort', 'promoting', 'still', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'box-office', 'eventually.Driving', 'Montana', 'northern', 'Wyoming', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'passed', 'Crazy', 'Woman', 'Mountain', 'think', 'was', 'probably', 'named', 'Mrs.', 'Morgan', 'story', 'family', 'was', 'killed', 'Crows', 'was', 'Johnson', 'hence', 'killing', 'spree.This', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'only', 'entertaining', 'Utah', 'scenery', 'delightful', 'even', 'little', 'insight', 'actual', 'hardships', 'real', 'Mountain', 'Men', 'Rockies', 'Sierras', 'Cascades', 'Blue', 'Mountains', 'West.Joseph', 'Joe', 'Pierre']",N/A

Maybe it's because I love the wilderness and have backpacked solo myself through vast and pristine mountain landscapes and sometimes wish I could live like a mountain man way out in a cabin far from the nearest town with only the company of a passing fox and flocks of chickadees at my feeder in the balsams. Oh the sweet scent of the balsams on the mountain trails. I love some of the sparse dialogue especially Grandpa Walton's parts and Del Gue as well. But really the parts that draw me in are the winter scenes and the cold stark beauty of the frozen mountains. I love the part when he wakes up after sleeping on the frozen ground with hardly any layers between him and the icy permafrost which we all know he would be freezing in a matter of minutes if this was true life. Also the parts when he gets wet there is no doubt that if it was realistic he would start to freeze very quickly. The Indian parts of the movie do nothing for me because the wilderness trumps all.

423389,A356QJWDT3P62R,6304457324,Keoma,"[1, 1]","One of my all time favorite movies is coming to blu-ray. I loved it when I saw it in the theater and although one of my friends said they didn't like it because there was no plot, I disagree. The story is about a man (former soldier) who leaves the trappings of civilization to experience and seek life in the mountain wilderness of the Rockie mountains. He runs into some real characters including one ol' grizzly of a mountain man (Will Geer) who takes Johnson under his wing and teaches him to trap and hunt ""griz'"". There are comic as well as heart-rending scenes(such as when he comes upon the slaughtered family with a mother who mostly lost her mind in grief and a son who lost his will to speak due to seeing his family killed), but then there are tender scenes as well when Jeremiah Johnson builds a log cabin for his squaw and the mute boy he reluctantly (at first) adopts. The music and the joy of the adopted family while undertaking a new life is probably my favorite scene in the movie. Friends and enemies and family come and go fairly quickly amongst the cold and lonely peaks of the mountains and in the end Jeremiah is alone again with the memories of his many adventures. Such was the life (I suppose) of many a mountain man and such were their legends. Lusciously photographed in Utah and fine performances by all it should be a great addition to any fan of westerns on the blu-ray.Now I'm looking forward to see The Mountain Men come out on blu-ray as the DVD did by no means do this movie justice what with the terrible picture quality that was on that release.

423406,A129YBX5BVNW2,6304457324,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[2, 2]","*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 BLU RAY REISSUE ***""Jeremiah Johnson"" is one of those movies that you wished you'd seen on the big screen. Well - with this sparkling new 2012 BLU RAY reissue boasting such a beautiful print - and if you've access to a half-decent home cinema kit - you sorta can mister (sorry couldn't resist).And there's more good news for us on the other side of the pond. Luckily this American Warner Brothers BLU RAY is 'All Regions' (A, B and C) so it will also play on all machines. And while it doesn't categorically state that the print has been fully restored (and despite a decidedly blurry opening shot of river boats) - a huge amount of cleaning up has taken place here because the print is BEAUTIFUL almost 95% of the time - and in some instances would put films of today to shame. There's even a hugely entertaining 'commentary' by the trio who made it - Director Sydney Pollack, Co-Writer John Milius and Actor Robert Redford.The other extra - an 11-minute Making Of called ""The Saga Of Jeremiah Johnson"" gives you a good indication of how bad the print was - it's 1972 picture quality is awful - covered in scratches and grain. The print itself is nothing like this. There are sequences by his cabin door in the sunshine which are so clear - even a night shot with Will Geer who plays the wily old mountain man Bear Claw around a campfire towards the end of the film is beautfully rendered. It's defaulted to 2.4:1 Aspect - so it has bars top and bottom. But it also has a 16:9 aspect fitting too - so even when stretched to full screen - it looks great and properly cinematic.The reissue's also faithful to the movie as seen - so it includes a 2-minute OVERTURE at the beginning with a still of Johnson standing on a mountain overlooking a valley - and at about 80 minutes in - it even gives us an INTERMISSION which in turn leads to a ENTR' ACTE restart. And no matter what the weather or season depicted - Winter, Spring, Summer or Autumn - it's shot with fantastic PanaVision bravado and style. The only real clunkers are the ever-so-slightly cheesy narrative at the beginning (words from it title this review) and the dreadfully dated 'aching cowboy' song that crops up at certain intervals when you least want it.Released in late 1972 - the film is a mid-1800's frontier tale - an amalgamation of a novel called ""Mountain Man"" by Vardis Fisher and a short story called ""Crow Killer"" by William Thorp. The ex-soldier Jeremiah Johnson seeks the solitude and freedom of the wilderness - which he gets - going months sometimes without ever seeing another human being. But he also finds freezing cold, starvation, friendly and hostile Indians (Flathead and Crow), pilgrim families and death by any number of savage means.Along the way he acquires a squaw-wife called ""The Swan"" (a beautiful part for Delle Bolton), a boy left mute by the killing of his family (Josh Albee) and a bald-headed loony he finds buried up to his neck in the sand called Del Gue (a scene-stealing turn by mad-eyed Stefan Gierasch). Throw in the near hysterical laughter of too-long-in-the-snow mountain-man Bear Claw (Will Geer) who is obsessed with hunting 'Griz' (Grizzly Bears) - and you get the general idea. Mostly Jeremiah muddles through - even threatening to become a 'family' man himself at one point. But then Johnson makes a gargantuan mistake in the second half of the movie by crossing sacred burial grounds and pays for it with a constant stream of singular Crow warriors Hell bent on killing him.Redford is magnificent in the central role - living it - breathing it - and looking more handsome than any mere mortal has a right to be. You can feel his star-quality screaming off the screen. You can also feel him relishing the outdoor settings, the simplicity of the life and the ecological thread running throughout the story. Filmed entirely on location in Utah - it has breathtaking scenery - and an almost savage reality to all of the characters - even those as vulnerable as women and children. It runs to just under two hours, but feels like three - and in a good way. And it all comes to a very satisfying and (in some ways) an unexpectedly uplifting ending...A fantastic BLU RAY reissue then - and what a thrill to see this criminally forgotten gem of a movie now sport such a gorgeous makeover.Recommended like a tumble in a river with a slippery salmon.And roll on Redford's own ""The Milagro Beanfield War"" in such superb print quality.BLU RAY Specifications:VIDEO: in 2.4:1 aspect and 16.9 alsoAUDIO: DTS-HD Master Audio English 5.1, Dolby Digital French 1.0 and Spanish (both Castilian 1.0 and Latin 2.0).SUBTITLES: English SDH (Deaf and Hard-Of-Hearing), French and SpanishEXTRAS:1.

423407,A15JEX5EC9VUJE,6304457324,"MaynardG ""maynardg""","[521, 545]","This movie is one of several fascinating historical threads that I have been following since I first saw it as a 12-year old and loved it. First, it is based on the actual life of a mountain man named John Johnston, later changed to Johnson, and known in the West from the mid-1840s as Liver-Eating Johnson (see the book ""Crow Killer"" published 1958, R.W. Thorp & R. Bunker). I did not know this until recently and assumed it was all fiction. He was a huge man for his time, 6'2"" and 240 pounds in his early 20's, had fists the size of baked hams and was best in hand-to-hand fighting with his 16"" Bowie knife. Thorp and Bunker based the book on first-person interviews with several mountain men and others who had known of him, including, surprisingly, the famous photographer of the 1870's West, W.H. Jackson (photographer for the Hayden Expedition and famous for the first photograph of Mount of the Holy Cross near Vail, Colorado), but the real detail being furnished by an old mountain man named White-Eye Anderson, who told the story to R.W.T. in 1941 when he was in his 90's. After Johnson's Flathead wife was murdered on the Musselshell in Montana by a band of young Crow braves, Johnson ""took the trail"" on the entire Crow nation. His calling card, for over 20 years of butchery on the Crows, was to remove the liver of every Crow he killed and eat it. The Crows called him ""Dapiek Absaroka"". Vardis Fischer, on whose book this movie is based, ""borrowed"" as well certain scenes from a book written in the 1840's called ""Life in the Far West"" by George Ruxton, a first-person account of life in and near the Colorado Rockies. This movie does a fine job with a subset of Johnston's life, leaving out his service in the Civil War, and his later life as a town marshal and finally, his death in an old veterans home in Los Angeles. I got the notion that Fischer's book bordered on plagiarism after reading Ruxton, and after reading Crow Killer it seems all Fischer did was change Johnson's name to Jeremiah and slap on a cover with his name on it. The movie also leaves out that Johnson spies, among the pile of bones that was his wife outside the cabin, a round object about the size of an orange - the skull of his unborn baby. He collects the bones of wife and baby and puts them in an iron pot and inters them behind carefully mortised rocks near the cabin; a shrine, his ""kittle 'o bones"" those closest to him called it (never in his presence) he visits over the years. Will Geer's character, near as I kin figger, is based on a friend of Johnson's named ""Bear Claw"" Chris Lapp, a man known to say, when presented with grizzly claws his mountain man friends collected for him to make necklaces of, ""Great Jehosophat! Pocahontas and John Smith!"" The Crazy Woman, one of the most sympathetic characters I have ever seen in a movie, was in real life the wife of John Morgan, a foolish homesteader on the Oregon Trail who quarreled with the wagon master and took off on his own only to be tomahawked and scalped alive by Crows, his daughter raped and scalped alive, and his two young sons killed. Mrs Morgan, having killed several of the Indians with an axe yet driven insane by the loss, lived on the Musselshell and was cared for by Johnson and his fellow mountain men for years. The movie leaves out the little detail that she and Johnson beheaded the Crow corpses and set them on stakes at each corner of the graveyard where she buried her children, the weathered skulls a powerful medicine for the Crows ever after. It was the Crow's deference to this insane white woman living in their midst that finally convinced Johnson to call off his vendetta against them, after having killed nearly 400 Crow warriors. Liver-Eating Johnson's grave (and here I borrow heavily from ""Crow Killer"") is in a cemetary off of Sepulveda Boulevard (interesting, that. One of Johnson's comrades was a huge black-bearded Hispanic named ""Big Anton Sepulveda"") in a section called San Juan Hill, row D, 2nd stone from the road reads ""Jno. Johnston, Co. H, 2nd Colo. Cav."". Get the movie and enjoy it; it's a true story. Only took me 30 years to find that out.",5,"A PG narrative of ""Liver-Eatin' Johnson""",1069891200,"11 27, 2003",2003,4147,"['movie', 'one', 'several', 'fascinating', 'historical', 'threads', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'first', 'saw', '12-year', 'old', 'loved', 'First', 'based', 'actual', 'life', 'mountain', 'man', 'named', 'John', 'Johnston', 'later', 'changed', 'Johnson', 'known', 'West', 'mid-1840s', 'Liver-Eating', 'Johnson', 'see', 'book', 'Crow', 'Killer', 'published', '1958', 'R.W', 'Thorp', 'R.', 'Bunker', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'recently', 'assumed', 'was', 'fiction', 'was', 'huge', 'man', 'time', '6', '2', '240', 'pounds', 'early', '20', 'had', 'size', 'baked', 'hams', 'was', 'best', 'hand-to-hand', 'fighting', '16', 'Bowie', 'knife', 'Thorp', 'Bunker', 'based', 'book', 'first-person', 'interviews', 'several', 'mountain', 'men', 'others', 'who', 'had', 'known', 'including', 'surprisingly', 'famous', 'photographer', '1870', 'West', 'W.H', 'Jackson', 'photographer', 'Hayden', 'Expedition', 'famous', 'first', 'photograph', 'Mount', 'Holy', 'Cross', 'Vail', 'Colorado', 'real', 'detail', 'being', 'furnished', 'old', 'mountain', 'man', 'named', 'White-Eye', 'Anderson', 'who', 'told', 'story', 'R.W.T', '1941', 'when', 'was', '90', 'Johnson', 'Flathead', 'wife', 'was', 'murdered', 'Musselshell', 'Montana', 'band', 'young', 'Crow', 'braves', 'Johnson', 'took', 'trail', 'entire', 'Crow', 'nation', 'calling', 'card', '20', 'years', 'butchery', 'Crows', 'was', 'remove', 'liver', 'Crow', 'killed', 'eat', 'Crows', 'called', 'Dapiek', 'Absaroka', 'Vardis', 'Fischer', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'borrowed', 'as', 'well', 'certain', 'scenes', 'book', 'written', '1840', 'called', 'Life', 'Far', 'West', 'George', 'Ruxton', 'first-person', 'account', 'life', 'Colorado', 'Rockies', 'movie', 'fine', 'job', 'subset', 'Johnston', 'life', 'leaving', 'out', 'service', 'Civil', 'War', 'later', 'life', 'town', 'marshal', 'finally', 'death', 'old', 'veterans', 'home', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'got', 'notion', 'Fischer', 'book', 'bordered', 'plagiarism', 'reading', 'Ruxton', 'reading', 'Crow', 'Killer', 'Fischer', 'did', 'was', 'change', 'Johnson', 'name', 'Jeremiah', 'slap', 'cover', 'name', 'movie', 'also', 'out', 'Johnson', 'spies', 'pile', 'bones', 'was', 'wife', 'cabin', 'round', 'object', 'size', 'orange', 'skull', 'unborn', 'baby', 'bones', 'wife', 'baby', 'iron', 'pot', 'inters', 'carefully', 'mortised', 'rocks', 'cabin', 'shrine', 'kittle', 'o', 'bones', 'closest', 'called', 'never', 'presence', 'years', 'Will', 'Geer', 'character', 'kin', 'figger', 'based', 'friend', 'Johnson', 'named', 'Bear', 'Claw', 'Chris', 'Lapp', 'man', 'known', 'say', 'when', 'presented', 'grizzly', 'claws', 'mountain', 'man', 'collected', 'make', 'necklaces', 'Great', 'Jehosophat', 'Pocahontas', 'John', 'Smith', 'Crazy', 'Woman', 'one', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'John', 'Morgan', 'foolish', 'homesteader', 'Oregon', 'Trail', 'who', 'quarreled', 'wagon', 'master', 'took', 'off', 'own', 'only', 'be', 'tomahawked', 'scalped', 'alive', 'Crows', 'daughter', 'raped', 'scalped', 'alive', 'two', 'young', 'sons', 'killed', 'Mrs', 'Morgan', 'having', 'killed', 'several', 'Indians', 'axe', 'yet', 'driven', 'insane', 'loss', 'lived', 'Musselshell', 'was', 'cared', 'Johnson', 'fellow', 'mountain', 'men', 'years', 'movie', 'out', 'little', 'detail', 'Johnson', 'beheaded', 'Crow', 'corpses', 'set', 'stakes', 'corner', 'graveyard', 'where', 'buried', 'children', 'weathered', 'powerful', 'medicine', 'Crows', 'ever', 'was', 'Crow', 'deference', 'insane', 'white', 'woman', 'living', 'midst', 'finally', 'convinced', 'Johnson', 'call', 'off', 'vendetta', 'having', 'killed', 'nearly', '400', 'Crow', 'warriors', 'Liver-Eating', 'Johnson', 'grave', 'here', 'borrow', 'heavily', 'Crow', 'Killer', 'cemetary', 'off', 'Sepulveda', 'Boulevard', 'interesting', 'One', 'Johnson', 'comrades', 'was', 'huge', 'black-bearded', 'Hispanic', 'named', 'Big', 'Anton', 'Sepulveda', 'section', 'called', 'San', 'Juan', 'Hill', 'row', 'D', '2nd', 'stone', 'road', 'Jno', 'Johnston', 'Co.', 'H', '2nd', 'Colo', 'Cav.', 'Get', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'true', 'story', 'Only', 'took', '30', 'years', 'find', 'out']",N/A

423410,A3IB5WCHJVJA4N,6304457324,"MF Regan ""Seth""","[5, 5]","Jeremiah Johnson has always been one of my favorite films and one that comes highly recommended.Redford has teamed with Director Sydney Pollack on several projects (This Property is Condemned, Three Days of the Condor, The Way We Were, Out of Africa and The Electric Horseman- all recommended), and their collaborations have always delivered interesting, intelligent and diverse work. Jeremiah Johnson is the most personal one of them all, I think. It offers something very different.There is a peaceful, quiet quality to the feeling in this film- one very much like the peace that Johnson is seeking in its beginnings as he retreats from `civilized life' to find a new way in the mountains. The scenic beauty, John Rubenstein and Tim McIntyre's music and songs, the honest portrayal of frontier life and its depictions of the Crow and Blackfoot Indian communities. They all give it a flavor all its own.Redford's portrayal of Johnson is some of the best work he has ever committed to film. He moves through the nave beginnings the man faces as he must learn to survive, through the unfolding truths the land, the Indians, the Old Man and the quickly created family he is offered, to the hurt and pain it all leads to when he inadvertently offers the wrong help in the wrong way. Redford's performance is seamless as he goes from the nave, hopeful beginnings to the jaded, worn warrior by its end. It's a role that demanded depth and he digs for it here.This isn't a film that one can categorize (thankfully) but I feel it's more historical in nature than a western or action piece. And although it may not be a complete essay on the real Jeremiah Johnson's life and times, it seems a well thought out one on what it was like for the men and women of these times. The struggles, the confusion-  the clash of cultures in their bid to survive and prosper- the peace, the violence and the aftermath of it all.There is humor, beauty, depth and character to the film and it is definitely one you can buy for your own personal library.",4,"The way that you wander is the way you choose, the day you tarry is the day you lose",1155600000,"08 15, 2006",2006,2029,"['Jeremiah', 'Johnson', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'one', 'highly', 'recommended.Redford', 'teamed', 'Director', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'several', 'projects', 'Property', 'Condemned', 'Three', 'Days', 'Condor', 'Way', 'Were', 'Out', 'Africa', 'Electric', 'Horseman-', 'recommended', 'collaborations', 'have', 'always', 'delivered', 'interesting', 'intelligent', 'diverse', 'work', 'Jeremiah', 'Johnson', 'most', 'personal', 'one', 'think', 'something', 'very', 'different.There', 'peaceful', 'quiet', 'quality', 'feeling', 'film-', 'one', 'very', 'much', 'peace', 'Johnson', 'seeking', 'beginnings', 'civilized', 'life', 'find', 'new', 'way', 'mountains', 'scenic', 'beauty', 'John', 'Rubenstein', 'Tim', 'McIntyre', 'music', 'songs', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'frontier', 'life', 'depictions', 'Crow', 'Blackfoot', 'Indian', 'communities', 'give', 'flavor', 'own.Redford', 'portrayal', 'Johnson', 'best', 'work', 'ever', 'committed', 'film', 'nave', 'beginnings', 'man', 'must', 'learn', 'survive', 'unfolding', 'truths', 'land', 'Indians', 'Old', 'Man', 'quickly', 'created', 'family', 'offered', 'hurt', 'pain', 'when', 'inadvertently', 'wrong', 'help', 'wrong', 'way', 'Redford', 'performance', 'seamless', 'nave', 'hopeful', 'beginnings', 'jaded', 'worn', 'warrior', 'end', 'role', 'demanded', 'depth', 'here.This', ""n't"", 'film', 'one', 'can', 'categorize', 'thankfully', 'feel', 'more', 'historical', 'nature', 'western', 'action', 'piece', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'complete', 'essay', 'real', 'Jeremiah', 'Johnson', 'life', 'times', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'one', 'what', 'was', 'men', 'women', 'times', 'struggles', 'confusion-', 'clash', 'cultures', 'bid', 'survive', 'prosper-', 'peace', 'violence', 'aftermath', 'humor', 'beauty', 'depth', 'character', 'film', 'definitely', 'one', 'can', 'buy', 'own', 'personal', 'library']",N/A

423417,A2UXNWAZ9210SO,6304457324,Moldyoldie,"[12, 13]","A greatly sanitized depiction of a legendary mountain man, Jeremiah Johnson is a reverently-made film so steeped in myth that it will probably be cherished by generations of escapist movie-lovers, both young and old, long after Robert Redford and Sydney Pollack themselves pass into the mists of Hollywood legend.From the very first scene as ex-soldier Johnson steps off the raft, one immediately senses the back-to-nature vibe so prevalent in the midst of Nixonian America--and it never lets up.  Here is a man who eschews American civilization for a one-way trip to where only eagles, grizzlies, and their kin can call home--not to mention the Crow, Flatheads, and Blackfeet.  No explanation is given because none was needed. Jeremiah Johnson embodied the psyche and yearning of nearly every war-weary American at that time.Every shot in the film is lovingly and painstakingly imbued with the spirit of the Rockies, even in those scenes presaging imminent battles with nature and natives.  The natural backdrop and sublimely understated musical scoring invite and allow the objective viewer to become intimate with Johnson along with his travails, encounters, and fates. I can't recall another Hollywood film of this ilk that so casts its protagonist with such a contrived stoic acquiescence to his dangerous and isolated existence. When the constantly set-upon Johnson is beseeched by a concerned fellow mountain man to head back down to a town, Johnson replies: ""I've seen a town.""  So have we, and we'd rather be along with Johnson.  Compare and contrast this with the slightly antedated Richard Harris vehicles A Man Called Horse and Man in the Wilderness. There are parts in this film, however, where Johnson's impassiveness is powerfully interrupted, including one of the most affecting and cinematically effective primal screams in the history of moviedom.Jeremiah Johnson is in my collection because I'm compelled to revisit it often.  There's really nothing ""not"" to like about it; its story, characters, direction, and awesomely beautiful setting make for a timeless viewing experience.  If anything can be said to be a slight weakness it would have to be Redford's often laboringly stilted speech acting.

423427,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,6304457324,Octavius,"[3, 4]","Few western genres have adequately portrayed what drove people to become pioneers or trappers and what life was really like for them. This movie stands in its own league in showing exactly what life was like for those brave trappers and early pioneers who decided to make the great move West.Redford plays a soldier who is fed up with the false trappings of civilized life; he decides to become a mountain man and move west. The main themes in this film are solitude and nature's indifference to human mores or conventions: nature exists for itself and one's skills at survival are the only things that matter there.  The cinematography captures the brutal elements of the untamed wilderness quite well and how they frustrate Johnson's efforts to call the mountains his home. The Indian actors are authentic and the film shows how various tribes such as the Crow and Flatheads lived and perceived the pioneers they came in contact with.  The folk music adds to the feel of the setting and theme of solitude.  There are some great lines such as, ""Hatchet Jack... He was a strange one: shared a cave for two years with a panther: she never did get used to him.""  As for reviewers who complain that the movie is slow or absent in dialogue: that is exactly the point and they've obviously missed it.  Absence of dialogue was common for men who lived in places almost completely devoid of people or people who spoke English: by showing this reality the movie captures the viewer into feeling what amounted to a very stoic and solitary life in the wilderness.  Mountain men and trappers were essentially hermits who only came to civilization during the summer months to sell their pelts and goods and to resupply for the next hunting/trapping season.Overall, this movie is an absolute masterpiece of American folklore which stands in its own league: it has no equal to compare with. If you like historically faithful movies about the real West and American folklore, this is definitely a movie to own without exception.

423433,A2MJ2LPNNQ7LIP,6304457324,Phil Berardelli,"[0, 0]","In this languid but absorbing and beautiful-looking movie, Robert Redford plays the title role, a mysterious mountain man whose exploits in the 1830s are loosely based on a real character named Johnston, whose nastier habits included cutting out the livers of his enemies and consuming them. Redford's Johnson is decidedly more genteel. He simply forsakes civilization to live out his life in solitude in the wilderness. Along the way, he encounters an assortment of bizarre characters, including Hatchet Jack, a man frozen to death on a mountain; Bear Claw, a bear hunter with a devilish sense of humor (Will Geer, best known as Grandpa on The Waltons TV series); a demented woman (Allyn Ann McLerie, who played a minor role with Redford in All the President's Men four years later, and was the neurotic mother in the quirky TV series Days and Nights of Molly Dodd); Swan, an Indian woman whom Johnson must take for a wife (Delle Bolton, in her one and only movie role), and Del Gue (Stefan Gierasch), another mountain man who shouts to himself deliberately. There are also many, many Indians. This mix makes for some vivid action sequences, but the movie is at its best in the long, quiet scenes set amid the stunning Utah landscapes, where backdrops include high, sheer mountainsides that once lay buried under an ancient ocean. For that reason, the movie is best appreciated in the theater, or on the biggest video screen you can find. The music of Tim McIntire and John Rubenstein provides a perfect mood, and you might hear yourself singing the title song lyrics in a gravelly voice for days afterward: ""The way that you wander is the way that you choose; the day that you tarry is the day that you lose.

Attila ""If honest work and justice are not...","[0, 0]","How has this one slipped under my radar so far?Jeremiah Johnson is based on the real-life story of the guy. In these cases, people often demand total factual accuracy and will reject fictional aspects. I don't like this approach. For me, a movie is about imagining, dreaming, and inspiring. It doesn't need to be a true story. If I can connect with it, then I will regard it as REAL, in which case I can allow it to have an effect on me.This movie certainly had an effect on me. It is magnificent, I think I will watch it regularly in the future - until I decide to live in the mountains myself :). It shows life in the wild is a very viable alternative and something humans are well suited to. Shame that nowadays we need to get all kinds of permits to even hunt for food. Instead you are expected to stuff yourself with factory farmed junk, living in an excessive 'shelter' made from industrial products, paying through the nose for a mortgage, tap water and gas.I will not talk about the movie's plot, if you like to dream about freedom, life in the wilderness, organic and indigenous living, then this film is a must watch. The scenery is awesome, the pacing is perfect, the soundtrack is fantastic.I've read comments about how Robert Redford, who is an avid Native American supporter, was willing to take on a role like this, killing lots of natives. These comments are totally deluded and are missing the point. There's nothing anti-native American about this movie, or about Jeremiah himself. He doesn't go out to kill natives, he simply kills people who hurt him or want to hurt him. Living in the wilderness, he is pretty much a native himself, but living by his own rules, rather than the rules of those tribes. In fact the very satisfying final scene completely dispels this ignorant notion.I have 2 issues with Jeremiah's way of living.One is the use of guns. Obviously, guns are made by the foolish empire one desires to leave behind. In my opinion they are totally needless for hunting, and can only serve as a destructive warring weapon, causing unnecessary injuries or deaths. It takes special skills to set traps and make bows and arrows, or other primitive weapons, but industry made guns do not belong in the wild. It's a great shame that post-European natives as well as white survivalists have regarded them a necessity.My other issue is his loneliness. I don't think it's necessary for survivalists or wilderness-men to go it alone. Of course he eventually had a woman and a boy, but neither were his own choice really. In my opinion the big extended family should and could be the base of life for people that decide to go this route. I understand though that very few eligible women are interested in this lifestyle.Obviously, these are not criticisms of the movie, but rather of the protagonists life choices. In no way does it affect my rating of the film. 11 out of 10 if possible :).",5,"They don't make them like this anymore, pilgrim",1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,2911,"['How', 'one', 'slipped', 'radar', 'so', 'far', 'Jeremiah', 'Johnson', 'based', 'real-life', 'story', 'guy', 'cases', 'people', 'often', 'demand', 'total', 'factual', 'accuracy', 'will', 'reject', 'fictional', 'aspects', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'approach', 'movie', 'imagining', 'dreaming', 'inspiring', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'true', 'story', 'can', 'connect', 'then', 'will', 'regard', 'REAL', 'case', 'can', 'allow', 'have', 'effect', 'me.This', 'movie', 'certainly', 'had', 'effect', 'magnificent', 'think', 'will', 'watch', 'regularly', 'future', 'decide', 'live', 'mountains', 'life', 'wild', 'very', 'viable', 'alternative', 'something', 'humans', 'are', 'well', 'suited', 'Shame', 'need', 'get', 'kinds', 'permits', 'even', 'hunt', 'food', 'Instead', 'are', 'expected', 'stuff', 'factory', 'farmed', 'junk', 'living', 'excessive', ""'shelter"", 'made', 'industrial', 'products', 'paying', 'nose', 'mortgage', 'tap', 'water', 'gas.I', 'will', 'not', 'talk', 'movie', 'plot', 'like', 'dream', 'freedom', 'life', 'wilderness', 'organic', 'indigenous', 'living', 'then', 'film', 'must', 'watch', 'scenery', 'awesome', 'pacing', 'perfect', 'soundtrack', 'fantastic.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'comments', 'how', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'who', 'avid', 'Native', 'American', 'supporter', 'was', 'willing', 'take', 'role', 'killing', 'lots', 'natives', 'comments', 'are', 'totally', 'deluded', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'nothing', 'anti-native', 'American', 'movie', 'Jeremiah', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'kill', 'natives', 'simply', 'people', 'who', 'hurt', 'want', 'hurt', 'Living', 'wilderness', 'pretty', 'much', 'native', 'living', 'own', 'rules', 'rather', 'rules', 'tribes', 'fact', 'very', 'satisfying', 'final', 'scene', 'completely', 'ignorant', 'notion.I', 'have', '2', 'issues', 'Jeremiah', 'way', 'living.One', 'use', 'guns', 'Obviously', 'guns', 'are', 'made', 'foolish', 'empire', 'one', 'leave', 'behind', 'opinion', 'are', 'totally', 'needless', 'hunting', 'can', 'only', 'serve', 'destructive', 'warring', 'weapon', 'causing', 'unnecessary', 'injuries', 'deaths', 'special', 'skills', 'set', 'traps', 'make', 'bows', 'arrows', 'other', 'primitive', 'weapons', 'industry', 'made', 'guns', 'do', 'not', 'belong', 'wild', 'great', 'shame', 'post-European', 'natives', 'as', 'well', 'white', 'survivalists', 'have', 'regarded', 'necessity.My', 'other', 'issue', 'loneliness', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'necessary', 'survivalists', 'wilderness-men', 'go', 'alone', 'course', 'eventually', 'had', 'woman', 'boy', 'were', 'own', 'choice', 'really', 'opinion', 'big', 'extended', 'family', 'should', 'could', 'be', 'base', 'life', 'people', 'decide', 'go', 'route', 'understand', 'very', 'few', 'eligible', 'women', 'are', 'interested', 'lifestyle.Obviously', 'are', 'not', 'criticisms', 'movie', 'rather', 'protagonists', 'life', 'choices', 'way', 'affect', 'rating', 'film', '11', '10', 'possible']",N/A

423454,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,6304457324,Robert J. Crawford,"[3, 3]","You can watch this film on many levels, to be peeled back on multiple viewings.  ALong with several other great films of the early 1970s (e.g. Little Big Man, Man Called Horse), the Indian is portrayed not as an indeciferable savage but as a human being with a radically different belief system that had its own notions of honor, love, and the sacred.  The twist that this film takes is that a white man decides he wants to live in the mountains, away from civilization, in a raw and dangerous environment full of the unknown and unknowable.  The film is his journey into that world, from neophyte to master.  THere is nothing like it in any cinema experience I know.JJ just sets off into the mountains, entering a horrendous struggle.  First, he must survive in the cold, by hunting and trapping.  He finds a mentor - the wonderful Bear Claw -  and moves on, with few words yet new knowledge.  Then, by cultural missteps, he blunders his way into a marriage with an Indian Squaw, whom he takes along with a mute boy he has adopted.  THey build a family, only to end in tragedy, setting off a train of deadly trials for JJ.  Eventually, he becomes part of his environment, acknowledged as almost a god by the Crow tribe.  Every step of his transformation is believable and vivid.What I so love about the film are the many subtleties, which can be savored in repeated viewings.  For example, there is a scene where JJ allows a Indian to live after having dispatched 4 other braves in 20 seconds.  For a long time, I wondered why he did this, until I concluded that he wanted to show mercy, yet allow the man to spread the word of his violent strength, a warning and challenge.  There are many such details, such as the marks on the arrows, identifying the murderer of his family.  Truly wonderful subtlety.While I am sure this is an idealized version of an ugly story, it is nonetheless tremendously stimulating.

423455,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6304457324,Robert Morris,"[10, 12]","No one can ever accuse Robert Redford of not taking on unorthodox roles, as indicated in this film as well as in others such as The Candidate (1972), Three Days of the Condor (1975), Sneakers (1992), and The Last Castle (2001). After serving in the U.S. Army, Jeremiah Johnson decides to become a mountain man in Colorado rather than accept what he saw as the limitations and constraints of civilization (such as it was) in the 1850s. Presumably he was trained in the use of weapons but hardly prepared for the dangers which await him. Throughout human history, food, shelter, and clothing have been essentials in life. Their importance is even greater to a mountain man who must obtain all three from natural resources. He ate whatever he could catch, trap or shoot. His temporary home could be a mud hut, a cave, a lean-to, or a sturdy tree branch high enough above the ground. He wore whatever he could devise from the hides of animals killed. (Hence the great value of bear, buffalo, and deer which provided both food and hides.) It is important to keep in mind that, for all intents and purposes, most mountain men were hermits. They were hunters, not farmers. During the severest of winter weather, they tended to hibernate like bears. They were almost always alone. For most of them, everything they needed and wanted could be found in the mountains.This is the life which Johnson fully embraced after an extended apprenticeship under the supervision of Bear Claws (played by Will Geer). Johnson is determined to live in peace. He adopts an orphan. He agrees to marry the daughter of a Flathead chief to avoid a confrontation with him. He is (in effect) compelled to serve as a guide to some U.S. cavalry on their mission to rescue settlers, at one point taking the most direct route through a Crow burial ground. In retaliation, the Crow respond by killing Johnson's family. Over time, after frequent encounters,  he reluctantly but inevitably gains an almost mythic reputation as an Indian killer.The natural beauty of Johnson's world (identified as Colorado but filmed in Utah) has been brilliantly captured by cinematographers Andrew Callaghan and Duke Callaghan under Sydney Pollack's equally brilliant direction. That beauty is juxtaposed gracefully with constant perils and various acts of violence. Although Geer provides a commanding presence as Johnson's mentor, another interesting mountain man is portrayed by Khigh Dhieg whose zest for life contrasts effectively with the taciturn Johnson who rescues him at one point. (Dhieg later played the role of Dr. Yen Lo in The Manchurian Candidate.)

It is over.  Who won?) a young man, Jeremiah Johnson, shakes off the dust of civilization to begin a new life in the wild mountains of western America.Sydney Pollack's 1972 JEREMIAH JOHNSON is grand entertainment, a sprawling story of man-in-nature filmed in some of the most beautiful country in America.  Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford) begins the adventure as a callow youth who can't fish or keep a fire going to save his life.  He clatters through the wilderness and lets his smell precede him.  At the rate he's going he won't be going much farther.Enter Bear Claw, a white wizened old mountain man who's wise in the ways of the wild and a great friend and hunter of grizz'.  Boisterously played by Will Geer, Bear Claw acts as mentor to young Johnson.  Bear Claw is the first of many colorful characters peppered throughout JEREMIAH JOHNSON.  Later Johnson will happen upon a woman whose family was massacred. The indians will not bother you on account of because you are touched, Johnson assures her.  Bear Claw must have taught him a LOT in that ten-minute scene of their'n.  Yet later we meet Del Gue (Stefan Gierasch), head shaved, buried up to his neck in sand, asking for a hat and desperately trying to blow an irritating feather out of his nose. Like Bear Claw before him, Del Gue is a picturesque and somewhat eccentric mentor.JEREMIAH JOHNSON needs all the colorful mountain men and Blackfeet and Shoshone and Flatheads it can get because Redford's character is as flat as hardtack and as colorful as a toad's belly.  Custom built for its star, the movie revolves around an introverted and introspective lead, something that works most of the time, although it's probably good they didn't give personality tests to prospective mountain men back then.  Redford doesn't fit the type.  This film would be a tough, long and dry read indeed without its wild men (and women) of the wild.The short, contemporary featurette on the dvd tells us that JEREMIAH JOHNSON is a saga about a young man in the wilderness, ""completely unaided, wholly responsible for himself.""  You could argue with that appealing tagline whose chief merit is that if fits on a billboard and plays to the Redford Mystique.  In any event, any movie whose main character hunts and fishes and messes around in the outdoors every day has a tremendous built in edge with a certain percentage of the moving watching public.  Better yet it has an obedient son (adopted from the touched woman) and a beautiful young indian bride.  Best, neither speaks a word of English!  The boy can't - sorry, cannot (we do not contract words in this movie), the boy cannot sass because he is mute, the woman cannot argue because you do not speak her language, and she do not speak your'n.For the most part, then, JEREMIAH JOHNSON is bully entertainment.  The location shots range from beautiful to breathtaking.  The action scenes are well composed and exciting, for the most part, anyway.  The wolves attack scene doesn't work - it relies too heavily on close-ups of snarling wolves clamping down on heavily padded arms and medium shots of a life sized ragdoll wolf or two being bounced against horse withers and fetlocks.  Heartily recommended for anyone who enjoys a rousing adventure played against a glorious background.",5,The marrow of the world,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,3438,"['Sometime', 'mid-1800s', 'presumably', 'onset', 'US', 'war', 'Mexico', '1846-48', 'prior', 'conclusion', 'How', 'war', 'Mexico', 'Who', 'won', 'young', 'man', 'Jeremiah', 'Johnson', 'dust', 'civilization', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'wild', 'mountains', 'western', 'America.Sydney', 'Pollack', '1972', 'JEREMIAH', 'JOHNSON', 'grand', 'entertainment', 'sprawling', 'story', 'man-in-nature', 'filmed', 'most', 'beautiful', 'country', 'America', 'Jeremiah', 'Johnson', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'adventure', 'callow', 'youth', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fish', 'keep', 'fire', 'going', 'save', 'life', 'wilderness', 'smell', 'rate', 'going', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'going', 'much', 'farther.Enter', 'Bear', 'Claw', 'white', 'wizened', 'old', 'mountain', 'man', 'who', 'wise', 'ways', 'wild', 'great', 'friend', 'hunter', 'grizz', 'Boisterously', 'played', 'Will', 'Geer', 'Bear', 'Claw', 'as', 'mentor', 'young', 'Johnson', 'Bear', 'Claw', 'first', 'many', 'colorful', 'characters', 'peppered', 'JEREMIAH', 'JOHNSON', 'Later', 'Johnson', 'will', 'happen', 'woman', 'family', 'was', 'massacred', 'indians', 'will', 'not', 'bother', 'account', 'are', 'touched', 'Johnson', 'Bear', 'Claw', 'must', 'have', 'taught', 'LOT', 'ten-minute', 'scene', 'n', 'later', 'meet', 'Del', 'Gue', 'Stefan', 'Gierasch', 'head', 'shaved', 'buried', 'up', 'neck', 'sand', 'asking', 'hat', 'desperately', 'trying', 'blow', 'irritating', 'feather', 'nose', 'Bear', 'Claw', 'Del', 'Gue', 'picturesque', 'somewhat', 'eccentric', 'mentor.JEREMIAH', 'JOHNSON', 'colorful', 'mountain', 'men', 'Blackfeet', 'Shoshone', 'Flatheads', 'can', 'get', 'Redford', 'character', 'as', 'flat', 'hardtack', 'as', 'colorful', 'toad', 'belly', 'Custom', 'built', 'star', 'movie', 'introverted', 'introspective', 'lead', 'something', 'most', 'time', 'probably', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'personality', 'tests', 'prospective', 'mountain', 'men', 'back', 'then', 'Redford', ""n't"", 'fit', 'type', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'tough', 'long', 'dry', 'read', 'indeed', 'wild', 'men', 'women', 'wild.The', 'short', 'contemporary', 'featurette', 'dvd', 'JEREMIAH', 'JOHNSON', 'saga', 'young', 'man', 'wilderness', 'completely', 'unaided', 'wholly', 'responsible', 'could', 'argue', 'appealing', 'tagline', 'chief', 'merit', 'fits', 'billboard', 'plays', 'Redford', 'Mystique', 'event', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'hunts', 'fishes', 'messes', 'outdoors', 'day', 'tremendous', 'built', 'edge', 'certain', 'percentage', 'moving', 'watching', 'public', 'Better', 'yet', 'obedient', 'son', 'adopted', 'touched', 'woman', 'beautiful', 'young', 'indian', 'bride', 'Best', 'neither', 'word', 'English', 'boy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sorry', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'not', 'contract', 'words', 'movie', 'boy', 'can', 'not', 'sass', 'mute', 'woman', 'can', 'not', 'argue', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'language', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'n.For', 'most', 'part', 'then', 'JEREMIAH', 'JOHNSON', 'bully', 'entertainment', 'location', 'shots', 'range', 'beautiful', 'breathtaking', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'composed', 'exciting', 'most', 'part', 'anyway', 'wolves', 'attack', 'scene', ""n't"", 'work', 'too', 'heavily', 'close-ups', 'snarling', 'wolves', 'clamping', 'down', 'heavily', 'padded', 'arms', 'medium', 'shots', 'life', 'sized', 'ragdoll', 'wolf', 'two', 'being', 'bounced', 'horse', 'withers', 'fetlocks', 'Heartily', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'rousing', 'adventure', 'played', 'glorious', 'background']",N/A

He learns all he needs to know from this old grizzly hunter and comes to find peace and solitude in the mountains.But as things sometimes do, they turn complicated, just like down in the flatlands.  Johnson marries a sqaw and takes responsibility for a boy from a ravaged family.  Johnson does his best to make good decisions and life an upstanding life.  He learns to live with trappers and indians.  He leads a life saving expidition to help a wagon train that has been snowed in and crosses indian burial land.

423483,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,6304457324,Themis-Athena,"[137, 145]","He was a big man, maybe even growing in physical stature with the growth of his myth; deadly with his Bowie knife and his gun alike.  Formerly a fighter in the U.S.-Mexican war, he had left the lowland's ways behind in favor of a mountain man's:  the lonesome hunt, the wild outdoors, and the confrontation with nature rather than his fellow men.  And he came to be known as ""Crow Killer"" and ""Liver Eating Johns(t)on"" when he took war to the Crow nation after they killed his wife.Based on Raymond Thorp/Robert Bunker's ""Crow Killer"" and Vardis Fisher's ""Mountain Man"" and scripted by John Milius and Edward Anhalt - with input from frequent Redford/Pollack cooperator David Rayfiel - Sydney Pollack's and Robert Redford's 1972 movie loosely traces the mythical hunter's legend, opening with his arrival at the fort where he buys his first horse and gun.  ""Ride due west as the sun sets.  Turn left at the Rocky Mountains,"" is a trader's goodnatured answer to Johnson's naive inquiry where to find ""bear, beaver and other critters worth cash money when skinned.""  But soon he finds that his lowland skills no longer do him any good, almost starving in the freezing mountainous winter before being taken in by old ""griz"" hunter Bear Claw Chris Lapp (Will Geer in a stand-out role - his and Redford's deadpan exchanges alone make this movie worth its price).Setting out on his own again the following year Johnson fares better, even gaining the respect of a Crow warrior prosaically named Paints His Shirt Red (Joaquin Martinez), the first person he encountered in the mountains.  After assisting a settler's wife who had to watch her family massacred by Indians (Allyn Ann McLerie) and reluctantly agreeing to take charge of her son (Josh Albee) - a boy grown mute by the horrors he witnessed, whom he names Caleb - he comes across white hunter Del Gue (Stefan Gierasch), buried up to his head in sand by a band of Blackfeet.  Revenging that act unwittingly leaves Johnson with a wife, in exchange for bestowing the Blackfeet's ponies and guns on Flathead chief Two-Tongues-Lebeaux (Richard Angarola): the chief's daughter Swan (Delle Bolton).  Although neither embraces the match enthusiastically, over time Jeremiah and Swan learn to appreciate and, eventually, love each other.  But then fate strikes:  Against better judgment pressured into guiding a cavalry company through Crow burial ground, Johnson finds Swan and Caleb murdered upon his return.  He sets out after the Crow who invaded his home ... and plants the seeds of his myth.""Jeremiah Johnson"" was Redford's and Pollack's second of seven collaborations after 1966's ""This Property is Condemned.""  What most obviously characterizes this movie is the breathtaking manner in which its cinematography uses Utah's mountains (doubling for the story's actual Montana setting): despite studio budgetary limits shot entirely on location, the film had Redford acting as a virtual tour guide to the magnificent Wasatch, which he had recently made his home himself.But the movie also shows enormous restraint, particularly given its violent underlying story.  There's no blood-gushing ""Braveheart""-style, no dramatic score; fights are mostly one-on-one, occurring as they would in real life - silently, with only the opponents' grunts being heard - and despite his fearsome epithet we never actually see Johnson eat a dead Crow warrior's liver.  (Reportedly a script change on which Redford insisted: wisely so.)  Similarly, Johnson's and Swan's relationship builds on small symbolic gestures, moving from his coarse attempts to teach her English and refusal to learn her language to conversations in Salish (Flathead); and from her submissive expectation of his exercising his marital rights on their wedding night (which rather repulses him) to later-exchanged tender glances and smiles:  Thus, we only learn about their marriage's belated consummation when one morning Swan points to his beard in response to his question about her reddish cheeks. - Further, there's no dramatic conclusion; no final battle: as Johnson's myth begins to grow and he withdraws deeper and deeper into the mountains, he retraces his steps and meets in reverse order the people he encountered after his arrival:  Del Gue, the settler now living in Caleb's mother's cabin, Bear Claw Chris Lapp; and finally Paints His Shirt Red who, although a Crow, created a monument in Johnson's honor and sends him off with a last salute, which Johnson reciprocates; ending the movie in an immortalizing freeze-frame shot - again, a feature insisted on by Redford, doubtlessly reminiscent of ""Butch and Sundance"" (and repeated one way or another in several subsequent movies).Despite its languid pace and although just under two hours long, ""Jeremiah Johnson"" formally takes an epic approach, complete with overture, entr'acte and narrator (uncredited, but I'm told Redford's ""Brubaker""-costar Tim McIntire), whose subtle voiceovers and brief songs provide key narrative bridges.  While the latter match the movie's overall style and the overture at least corresponds with Johnson's mythical stature - albeit also setting up ultimately unfulfilled expectations of a dramatic finale - adding an entr'acte may have been a bit much, particularly in the middle of the ride through the Crow burial ground (incidentally a screenplay addition designed to give the Indians a reason to punish Johnson and not make them appear as mindless killers).  In my view this breaks the dramatic tension rather than enhancing it; problematic insofar as virtually all that remains thereafter is Johnson's gradual withdrawal into the mountains and fights with the Crow.  But no matter.  This is a terrific movie, featuring great banter with Johnson's fellow hunters as well as some wonderfully delicate scenes with Swan, showcasing some of North America's most dramatically beautiful scenery, and growing on you more and more the more often you watch it.And some say he's up there still ...""The way that you wander is the way that you choose.  The day that you tarry is the day that you lose.

423484,A3NP8P2PHBZABD,6304457324,"Tidewater ""Whaler""","[1, 4]","I am no fan of Robert Redford's acting, so readers take note. To me, he is unconvincing in a laconic ""tough guy"" role; therefore, as a self-sufficient ""mountain man,"" he doesn't cut it. Yet, in many scenes in the movie, he comes close.The movie itself is strange. At the end, one has spent time with a man (the main character, Jeremiah Johnson) whose life is as aimless after many years in the mountains as it was when he first headed west. At about 1/3 of the movie, he actually seems to be settling down, with an Indian wife and an abandoned child (having single-handedly built a cabin consisting of massive logs and an extensive roof in just under five minutes of movie time--Pollack should have been ashamed of himself, as the sequence looks more like a Home Depot ad, 19th century version, than anything close to reality). But fate arrives in the form of an Army column seeking to rescue some stranded pioneers. Johnson reluctantly agrees to go with the column as a guide, and in the course of his work leads the troops through a sacred Crow burial site--an astonishing lapse which can only be understood in the light of screen-writing gimmickry. It is inconceivable to me that someone as sensitive to nature and alert to his environment (including the Indians), as Redford's character is portrayed, would have agreed to do such a thing, especially since he would be well aware of the (fatal) consequences.From then on, the movie's plot consists essentially of several massacres, along with a seemingly endless series of one-on-one fights to the death as one Crow warrior after another (unsuccessfully) seeks redress for Johnson's trespass and later murders.

Jeremiah Johnson is a man fed up with civilization so he decides to go west and become a mountain man.  At first, he struggles to survive, but he comes upon an old grizzled mountain man, Bear Claw, who teaches him how to survive on his own in such a harsh environment.  Now living on his own, Jeremiah comes upon a boy whose family has been massacred by Crow Indians and takes him along with him.  He also takes an Indian wife, and the trio make an unlikely family.  This is a very good movie that shows very accurately what life was like in the mid 1800's.  As well, the film is beautifully shot in the mountains of Utah.Robert Redford is very good as mountain man, Jeremiah Johnson, who becomes a legend during his time in the mountains.  Redford is surprisingly believable in the role as the mountain man who must survive on his own.  Will Geer is perfectly cast as the grizzled mountain man, Bear Claw, who teaches Jeremiah how to survive.  The DVD offers widescreen and fullscreen presentations, production notes, and a making of featurette.

I suspect the delay had more to do with either restoring the film or finding a good print of the movie to present on Blu-ray. Either way, this forgotten classic has finally arrived with a nice looking transfer and a couple of nice extras.The title character (Redford) elects to abandon civilization and takes to the isolation of the Rocky Mountains to carve out a new and largely solo life for himself. Johnson struggles to survive in the wilderness until he meets a grizzled trapper (the late Will Geer)who teaches him many of the skills to survive. Johnson unexpectedly with a wife and young boy after a series of adventures.""Jeremiah Johnson"" has always looked somewhat soft due largely to the choices when shooting the film as well as the stock used to photograph the film. ""Jeremiah Johnson"" looks handsome in its high definition debut with nice detail and largely looks like what it is--a film shot in the early 70's.The audio remains faithful to the mono original soundtrack with both the pluses (dialogue clear) and minuses (little to no directionality or depth, tiny sound effects). The 5.1 lossless remix improves on the mono but in subtle ways. This isn't an immersive nor state-of-the-art remix but it's quite good.The special features are pretty good considering the age of the film and the lack of attention the film receives by most film fans; we get an intelligent commentary track that features all the key people involved in the making of the film including Redford, Pollack and co-writer John Milius (all recorded separately but combined for a single commentary track). It's a pity all three weren't in the same room as their interaction might have sparked more memories or differing views on shooting the film. Having said that the commentary track is exceptionally good with very little silence and it's rare that any of the participants simply describe the action usually digging in to discuss the original ending, the challenges of shooting on location and the changes the script went through prior to shooting.Back in the 1970's promotional featurettes were often produced that were shown on late night TV or to fill time after sports events on TV. While the vintage featurette we see here isn't indepth, it's a pretty good glimpse into the past with some behind-the-scenes footage.We also get the original theatrical trailer which gives you an idea as to how the art of making effective trailers has changed with time.""Jeremiah Johnson"" remains a riveting tale about a man who decides to eschew all the trappings of civilization.

423497,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6304457324,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","Well, sort of.Like ""Dances with Wolves,"" ""Jeremiah Johnson"" (1972) is about a white man choosing to live in the wilderness and his inevitable interactions with natives. Like ""Dances,"" it features realistic natives and was a hit at the box office. Unlike ""Dances,"" the story takes place in the mountains, rather than the prairie, and it's less compelling.THE PLOT: Jeremiah Johnson decides to leave civilization behind to become a mountain man in the Rockies. At first he's a bit nave to the ways of the high country but he learns and eventually acquires a kid and a native wife. Although he befriends some natives, he develops hostilities with the Crow. Johnson proves himself in combat and develops an almost legendary status while braves keep coming after him to win a name for themselves.The film was based on the true story of Liver-Eating Johnson who notoriously ate the liver of the braves he killed because the Crow believed the liver was vital for the afterlife. He was also known as Crow Killer and killed braves for 25 years, attaining legendary status, but finally made peace with the tribe.Some people complain about Robert Redford in the title role, suggesting that he was too much of a handsome movie star, but who says all mountain men were brawny and ugly? It is true, however, that the real Johnson was 6'2"" and 260 lbs, while Redford is 5'9"" and fairly lean. Even though Charleton Heston would've been better in the role, Redford does fine.Although the stomping grounds of the real Johnson was Montana and N. Wyoming, the film was shot in Utah, which sometimes has too much of a Southwest flair to be a good substitute. Regardless, the locations are spectacular. Some even point out that the movie is worth owning just for the location photography.The film was directed by Sydney Pollack and adopted by John Milius from the book ""Mountain Men"" and the story ""Crow Killer."" It runs 116 minutes.FINAL WORD: It's interesting to watch this film and observe Native Americans being portrayed realistically and respectfully almost two decades before the heralded ""Dances With Wolves."" ""Jeremiah Johnson"" may not be great like ""Dances"" but it's quite good, as long as you're in the mood for an atypical Western that's kind of low key and doesn't spell everything out. If you're looking for cowboys, saloon gunfights and cavalry, forget it.GRADE: B",4,"The ""Dances With Wolves"" of the 70s",1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,2357,"['Well', 'sort', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Jeremiah', 'Johnson', '1972', 'white', 'man', 'choosing', 'live', 'wilderness', 'inevitable', 'interactions', 'natives', 'Dances', 'realistic', 'natives', 'was', 'hit', 'box', 'office', 'Dances', 'story', 'place', 'mountains', 'rather', 'prairie', 'less', 'compelling.THE', 'PLOT', 'Jeremiah', 'Johnson', 'leave', 'civilization', 'become', 'mountain', 'man', 'Rockies', 'first', 'bit', 'nave', 'ways', 'high', 'country', 'eventually', 'kid', 'native', 'wife', 'natives', 'hostilities', 'Crow', 'Johnson', 'combat', 'almost', 'legendary', 'status', 'braves', 'keep', 'coming', 'win', 'name', 'themselves.The', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Liver-Eating', 'Johnson', 'who', 'notoriously', 'ate', 'liver', 'braves', 'killed', 'Crow', 'believed', 'liver', 'was', 'vital', 'afterlife', 'was', 'also', 'known', 'Crow', 'Killer', 'killed', 'braves', '25', 'years', 'attaining', 'legendary', 'status', 'finally', 'made', 'peace', 'tribe.Some', 'people', 'complain', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'title', 'role', 'suggesting', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'handsome', 'movie', 'star', 'who', 'mountain', 'men', 'were', 'brawny', 'ugly', 'true', 'however', 'real', 'Johnson', 'was', '6', '2', '260', 'lbs', 'Redford', '5', '9', 'fairly', 'lean', 'Even', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'role', 'Redford', 'fine.Although', 'stomping', 'grounds', 'real', 'Johnson', 'was', 'Montana', 'N.', 'Wyoming', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Utah', 'sometimes', 'too', 'much', 'Southwest', 'flair', 'be', 'good', 'substitute', 'Regardless', 'locations', 'are', 'spectacular', 'even', 'point', 'out', 'movie', 'worth', 'owning', 'just', 'location', 'photography.The', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'adopted', 'John', 'Milius', 'book', 'Mountain', 'Men', 'story', 'Crow', 'Killer', '116', 'minutes.FINAL', 'WORD', 'interesting', 'watch', 'film', 'observe', 'Native', 'Americans', 'being', 'portrayed', 'realistically', 'respectfully', 'almost', 'two', 'decades', 'heralded', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Jeremiah', 'Johnson', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'Dances', 'quite', 'good', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'mood', 'atypical', 'Western', 'kind', 'low', 'key', ""n't"", 'spell', 'everything', 'out', ""'re"", 'looking', 'cowboys', 'saloon', 'gunfights', 'cavalry', 'forget', 'it.GRADE', 'B']",N/A
