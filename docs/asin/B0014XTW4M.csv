1147590,ABSF90T08ADBX,B0014XTW4M,"A. Conner ""earthsleep""","[9, 10]","I'm going to keep this simple.  For all those interested in Highway to Heaven Season 4 & 5 I'll write out everything you need to know on where to buy it, and how to view it.Go to the Amazon/UK site (if I type the web address it'll blank out I think so just use a search engine and it'll show up).Log in to the UK site as you would the U.S. one.  All information such as username and passwords are the same.Find Highway to Heaven Season 4 & 5 and add them to the cart.  Checkout will convert the currency to dollars for you and Amazon will use your normal information to pay for all of what you buy.The two seasons are in spoken english with optional english & french subtitles.  The video quality is what you would expect from any american release.  The only differences are the covers are in French and the region coding is different.For those who don't understand I'll explain.  Every region of the world has what's called region coding for dvd's.  The players around the world are set for that specific region.  Britian's and France's region is 2 I think where as the U.S. and Canada is 1.  Our players won't play their dvd's...unless you know how to get around it all.To view an odd region dvd in America you'll need either a pc dvd drive with the appropriate software such as vlc player which is free online, or you'll need a dvd player that's had it's region settings taken out.  For the dvd player you can either buy one already set at region 0 (That's what you'll want) or you can do it yourself by doing research online.  Some dvd players are easier to hack than others with their remote controls.  You just have to know which player and what the hack is.  Their are web sites that have this information but it does take research.A word of warning.  When I bought the two seasons just a short time ago there were not that many leading me to the impression that a moratorium status may be coming (moratorium is when a dvd is no longer printed).  There just didn't seem to be that many and the price was dare I say shocking.  If they do go moratorium, the price will be greater until there's no more left.By the way I paid roughly $80 for each season so be prepared to cough it up.  It's tough to swallow but worth it in my opinion.One more thing.  I did some research and A&E; who put out the first 3 seasons is defiant about releasing the last two seasons in North America.  Sales were down.  Same old song.  It's been years and no other company has bought the rights to release it so chances are, no one will.  I just don't want die hard fans to lose their shot at owning the last seasons to this special show.I hope all this helped.",5,Highway to Heaven...Found!,1315008000,"09 3, 2011",2011,2643,"[""'m"", 'going', 'keep', 'simple', 'interested', 'Highway', 'Heaven', 'Season', '4', '5', ""'ll"", 'write', 'out', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'where', 'buy', 'how', 'view', 'it.Go', 'Amazon/UK', 'site', 'type', 'web', 'address', ""'ll"", 'blank', 'out', 'think', 'so', 'just', 'use', 'search', 'engine', ""'ll"", 'show', 'up', '.Log', 'UK', 'site', 'would', 'U.S.', 'one', 'information', 'such', 'username', 'passwords', 'are', 'same.Find', 'Highway', 'Heaven', 'Season', '4', '5', 'add', 'cart', 'Checkout', 'will', 'convert', 'currency', 'dollars', 'Amazon', 'will', 'use', 'normal', 'information', 'pay', 'what', 'buy.The', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'spoken', 'english', 'optional', 'english', 'french', 'subtitles', 'video', 'quality', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'american', 'release', 'only', 'differences', 'are', 'covers', 'are', 'French', 'region', 'coding', 'different.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'region', 'world', 'what', 'called', 'region', 'coding', 'dvd', 'players', 'world', 'are', 'set', 'specific', 'region', 'Britian', 'France', 'region', '2', 'think', 'where', 'U.S.', 'Canada', '1', 'players', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'dvd', 'know', 'how', 'get', 'view', 'odd', 'region', 'dvd', 'America', ""'ll"", 'need', 'pc', 'dvd', 'drive', 'appropriate', 'software', 'such', 'vlc', 'player', 'free', 'online', ""'ll"", 'need', 'dvd', 'player', 'had', 'region', 'settings', 'taken', 'out', 'dvd', 'player', 'can', 'either', 'buy', 'one', 'already', 'set', 'region', '0', 'what', ""'ll"", 'want', 'can', 'do', 'doing', 'research', 'online', 'dvd', 'players', 'are', 'easier', 'hack', 'others', 'remote', 'controls', 'just', 'have', 'know', 'player', 'what', 'hack', 'are', 'web', 'sites', 'have', 'information', 'take', 'research.A', 'word', 'warning', 'When', 'bought', 'two', 'seasons', 'just', 'short', 'time', 'were', 'not', 'many', 'leading', 'impression', 'moratorium', 'status', 'may', 'be', 'coming', 'moratorium', 'when', 'dvd', 'no', 'longer', 'printed', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'many', 'price', 'was', 'dare', 'say', 'shocking', 'do', 'go', 'moratorium', 'price', 'will', 'be', 'greater', 'more', 'way', 'paid', 'roughly', '80', 'season', 'so', 'be', 'prepared', 'cough', 'up', 'tough', 'swallow', 'opinion.One', 'more', 'thing', 'did', 'research', 'A', 'E', 'who', 'put', 'out', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'defiant', 'releasing', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'North', 'America', 'Sales', 'were', 'down', 'Same', 'old', 'song', 'been', 'years', 'other', 'company', 'bought', 'rights', 'release', 'so', 'chances', 'are', 'one', 'will', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'lose', 'shot', 'owning', 'last', 'seasons', 'special', 'show.I', 'hope', 'helped']",Highway to Heaven - Season 4

1147592,A31SPMWI88NT9M,B0014XTW4M,Gordon Raisley,"[2, 2]","It's been six years now since season 3 of ""Highway to Heaven"" has been released. As to why this great show (especially one with Michael Landon) wasn't very popular for dvd purchases, is beyond me. Even if it is just temporary, I think the last 2 seasons should at least be released for the sake of fans of this show. It's not fair to fans of a tv show to not be able to have anymore dvd's just because hardly anyone else will buy it. Fortunately, I did get to see the unreleases episodes on youtube a couple years ago, so I'm not as disappointed as I was before that. Could music rights also be the reason? Even if I have got to watch every episode, I still would like to own the last 2 seasons. Good shows like this one aren't seen on TV anymore.",5,There's no reason this particular series shouldn't finish being released on dvd.,1333152000,"03 31, 2012",2012,747,"['been', 'six', 'years', 'now', 'season', '3', 'Highway', 'Heaven', 'been', 'released', 'why', 'great', 'show', 'especially', 'one', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'popular', 'dvd', 'purchases', 'Even', 'just', 'temporary', 'think', 'last', '2', 'seasons', 'should', 'least', 'be', 'released', 'sake', 'fans', 'show', 'not', 'fair', 'fans', 'tv', 'show', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'anymore', 'dvd', 'just', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'else', 'will', 'buy', 'Fortunately', 'did', 'get', 'see', 'unreleases', 'episodes', 'youtube', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', ""'m"", 'not', 'as', 'disappointed', 'was', 'Could', 'music', 'rights', 'also', 'be', 'reason', 'Even', 'have', 'got', 'watch', 'episode', 'still', 'would', 'like', 'own', 'last', '2', 'seasons', 'Good', 'shows', 'one', 'are', ""n't"", 'seen', 'TV', 'anymore']",Highway to Heaven - Season 4

Some of the best shows are in seasons 4&5.  Bill Erwin plays one of the funniest Santa Claus I've ever seen!  The entire show of Dreams and Wild Horses is superb!  Amazing writing.  The unforgettable We Have Forever.AND The storylines!  More revelant today than back then! Man's Best Friend about infant adoption and foster care.  The People Next Door about cultural prejudices and hiding who you really are.  And the guest star of that show is brillantly bought back in season 5's Whose Trash Is It Anyways about politics and being a leader.  And The Silent Bell, what's more revelant at this moment than private employees and the church organiztions that they work for?The show didn't pull on heartstrings it ripped them out of your chest.  The sheer fact that most Americans have been denied access to the some of the best that this show had to produce is absolutely a travesty.
