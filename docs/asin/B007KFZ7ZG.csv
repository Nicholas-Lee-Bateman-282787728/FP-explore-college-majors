1532802,A2L3IT6PMWD208,B007KFZ7ZG,charmfoz,"[0, 1]","For the most part, this is not at all a direct adaptation of Charlotte Perkins Gillman's short story. For Logan Thomas' retelling of this story, I had a hard time getting past the horrible acting and even more so past the dramatic, choppy transitions between scenes. I think that the intent of the choppy scenes may have been to give viewers a feeling horror, being in a nightmare from which they can't wake. For instance, you're flying, suddenly you're falling, then suddenly you're being swallowed whole by an alligator with two heads. Now the two-headed alligator is your mother-in-law, she regurgitates you and after a few chews she spits you out, hurtling you through space and time. You finally find yourself naked, trying in vain to open your junior high locker to get clothing you know is in there, but you've forgotten the combination!  Oh the horror! Okay, and then there's the story line. What local residents our characters do come across impart that they're all in on a horrible secret that of course they're not willing to let our heros in on. The story flows from tedious boredom to tedious boredom to suprise intended horror back to tedious boredom. When we're finally brought to scenes that was to provide horror, there was no feeling of consistency to the nature of what horrible manifestation would ultimately ruin the young couple in the movie. It's psychosis? Or ghosts? Oh wait, now it's an evil shape shifting demon! Mangey demon dogs? Dead gladiator wandering the desert...wt??? Finally, when the real monster is revealed, it seems to me the viewer is &#34;supposed&#34; to conclude, oh yes, this makes complete sense even though there was no foundation set in the movie to ever suggest a...vampire! Worse yet, he's an extremely old coot of a vampire and he's been seated at the dinner table the whole time and no one noticed! Sorry for the spoiler. :/  Logan then inserts flashbacks to earlier scenes (sister-in-law tar-tar) that is supposed to validate the vampire-happily-ever-after ending and tie the inanity of Logan's story back to the strongest premise of movement behind the yellow wallpaper in Gillman's story. Logan's woman behind the yellow wallpaper is a vampire who opens a hidden door in an attic room each night to suck the blood out of the living and her husband is now a vampire slave, doomed to do her bidding for eternity. Genius symbolism or just plain stupid? Especially since everyone knows, attics get hot and vampires prefer the coolness of basements. Duh. Logan ends his adaptation set in the 1970's, with the ill-fated husband of our yellow wallpapered vampiress, greeting a new couple, who were apparently invited in as dinner, wearing the most ghastly polyester leisure suit ever. The feigned horror! Luckily there, the attempt at horror ends and the credits roll.",2,Extremely Disappointing Adaptation,1404172800,"07 1, 2014",2014,2816,"['most', 'part', 'not', 'direct', 'adaptation', 'Charlotte', 'Perkins', 'Gillman', 'short', 'story', 'Logan', 'Thomas', 'retelling', 'story', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'horrible', 'acting', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'dramatic', 'choppy', 'transitions', 'scenes', 'think', 'intent', 'choppy', 'scenes', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'give', 'viewers', 'feeling', 'horror', 'being', 'nightmare', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wake', 'instance', ""'re"", 'flying', 'suddenly', ""'re"", 'falling', 'then', 'suddenly', ""'re"", 'being', 'swallowed', 'whole', 'alligator', 'two', 'heads', 'Now', 'two-headed', 'alligator', 'mother-in-law', 'few', 'chews', 'out', 'hurtling', 'space', 'time', 'finally', 'find', 'naked', 'trying', 'vain', 'open', 'junior', 'high', 'locker', 'get', 'clothing', 'know', 'there', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'combination', 'Oh', 'horror', 'Okay', 'then', 'story', 'line', 'What', 'local', 'residents', 'characters', 'do', 'come', 'impart', ""'re"", 'horrible', 'secret', 'course', ""'re"", 'not', 'willing', 'let', 'heros', 'story', 'tedious', 'boredom', 'tedious', 'boredom', 'suprise', 'intended', 'horror', 'back', 'tedious', 'boredom', 'When', ""'re"", 'finally', 'brought', 'scenes', 'was', 'provide', 'horror', 'was', 'feeling', 'consistency', 'nature', 'what', 'horrible', 'manifestation', 'would', 'ultimately', 'ruin', 'young', 'couple', 'movie', 'psychosis', 'ghosts', 'Oh', 'wait', 'now', 'evil', 'shape', 'shifting', 'demon', 'Mangey', 'demon', 'dogs', 'Dead', 'gladiator', 'wandering', 'desert', 'wt', 'Finally', 'when', 'real', 'monster', 'revealed', 'viewer', '34', 'supposed', '34', 'conclude', 'oh', 'yes', 'complete', 'sense', 'even', 'was', 'foundation', 'set', 'movie', 'ever', 'suggest', 'vampire', 'Worse', 'yet', 'extremely', 'old', 'coot', 'vampire', 'been', 'seated', 'dinner', 'whole', 'time', 'one', 'noticed', 'Sorry', 'spoiler', '/', 'Logan', 'then', 'flashbacks', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'sister-in-law', 'tar-tar', 'supposed', 'validate', 'vampire-happily-ever-after', 'ending', 'tie', 'inanity', 'Logan', 'story', 'back', 'strongest', 'premise', 'movement', 'yellow', 'wallpaper', 'Gillman', 'story', 'Logan', 'woman', 'yellow', 'wallpaper', 'vampire', 'who', 'hidden', 'door', 'attic', 'room', 'night', 'suck', 'blood', 'living', 'husband', 'now', 'vampire', 'slave', 'doomed', 'do', 'bidding', 'eternity', 'Genius', 'symbolism', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'Especially', 'everyone', 'knows', 'attics', 'get', 'hot', 'vampires', 'prefer', 'coolness', 'basements', 'Duh', 'Logan', 'adaptation', 'set', '1970', 'ill-fated', 'husband', 'yellow', 'wallpapered', 'vampiress', 'greeting', 'new', 'couple', 'who', 'were', 'apparently', 'invited', 'dinner', 'wearing', 'most', 'ghastly', 'polyester', 'leisure', 'suit', 'ever', 'feigned', 'horror', 'Luckily', 'there', 'attempt', 'horror', 'ends', 'credits', 'roll']",The Yellow Wallpaper

So when I stumbled on this new release, I was thrilled.  After watching this movie I can share the highlights of my observations.  The director relies heavily on the musical score to set the mood and pace with lots of foreshadowing.  Its effective and had me jumping at times.  The re-imagination of the original story is clever for a modern horror genre.  The house and setting are creepy beautiful and atmospheric. But the big let-down in this film is the acting.  I can't decide if it's the actors or the director at fault for this.  The dialogue feels more like a stage production than a film.  Timing is off and at times the lines .  My final thought would be that if you can watch PBS or BBC films, you might seriously appreciate this film.  It slowly builds towards its ending and gives a few good frights along the way.",3,"Wonderful, awful, and everything between.",1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,935,"['have', 'read', 'original', 'story', 'years', 'ago', 'saw', 'PBS', 'adaptation', 'made', 'memorable', 'impression', 'when', 'stumbled', 'new', 'release', 'was', 'thrilled', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'share', 'highlights', 'observations', 'director', 'heavily', 'musical', 'score', 'set', 'mood', 'pace', 'lots', 'foreshadowing', 'effective', 'had', 'jumping', 'times', 're-imagination', 'original', 'story', 'clever', 'modern', 'horror', 'genre', 'house', 'setting', 'are', 'creepy', 'beautiful', 'atmospheric', 'big', 'let-down', 'film', 'acting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'actors', 'director', 'fault', 'dialogue', 'more', 'stage', 'production', 'film', 'Timing', 'off', 'times', 'lines', 'My', 'final', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'can', 'watch', 'PBS', 'BBC', 'films', 'might', 'seriously', 'appreciate', 'film', 'slowly', 'towards', 'ending', 'few', 'good', 'frights', 'way']",The Yellow Wallpaper
1532805,A1ZIY3F0B6X297,B007KFZ7ZG,K. Johnson,"[5, 10]","First, I want to say that more than anything, this movie is just plain sad.  It is a case study for how to take beautiful material, and completely destroy it.The first mistake the filmmakers made, was to not be faithful to the excellent classic short story by of the same name by Charlotte Perkins Gilman.  Had they actually made a movie that was faithful to her excellent work, then this movie might not have turned out so awful.  In the end, they included just enough references to the short story, (such as character names, the title, the daughter, etc.) to cash in on the fame of the short story, but changed enough of the storyline, (making the husband the central character and the pathetic ending) to make the movie horrible.While not all bad, the bad portions so completely overwhelm the good, that you will find yourself wondering why you wasted the time.The Good:1.  The performances by the females....especially Juliet Landau, who would have been perfect if the movie had actually been a faithful representation of the short story. There are some great actors in this film.....Juliet Landau, Veronica Cartwright, Michael Moriarty and Dale Dickey.  They deliver subtle yet thoughtful performances and  all do as well as they possibly could have, considering the bad writing.  By the end of the film I felt sorry for them.2.  The cinematography is beautiful and appropriate for the film.  Especially the backlit scenes.The Bad:1.  The disjointed and irrelevant scenes.  Particularly the duel and desert scenes, which don't fit the film, provide no explanation, and add nothing to the story.2.  The predictable ""easy way out"", and disappointing ending.  So much time is spent building the suspense that the ending is fairly anticlimactic.3.  The music is completely over the top, melodramatic, and just plain bad.  So bad in fact, that at times it is laughable.  It desperately tries to create a sense of fear and suspense, building to an almost manic crescendo, then cuts to a sunny scene of the front of the house.  It does this sort of thing so often, that when it comes to a scene that might truly be scary, the music is now ineffective and you have learned to ignore it.The Ugly:1.  The truly horrible job of the lead actor, Aric Cushing.  He must be one of the worst actors I have ever seen, and delivers a performance so deadpan and uninspired that anyone off the street could have done better. Compound this with the fact that he is not only the main character, but also the narrator. I couldn't figure out how he got the part until I read on IMDB that he is also credited as Executive Producer. Ahhhhh....that explains a lot.2.  The disjointed nature of the movie.  The filmmakers took just enough details from the short story to intrigue you, yet change enough of the movie to make it seem like they were just capitalizing on the fame of the short story.  Case in point - the title.  The Yellow Wallpaper, you would imagine, would at least have a role in the story, but it seems that these scenes were cut out.  In fact, it seems like the movie was supposed to be one concept, and that they changed it midway through....hence the duel and desert scenes, which almost seem to be added as filler.  The choice to focus on the husband as the main character, especially when portrayed by such an inept actor, is extremely disappointing.Despite the questionable glowing reviews, I invite you to see it for yourself, and judge whether what I say is true....if you can stay awake.",2,"Some Good, But Mostly Horrible",1344643200,"08 11, 2012",2012,3490,"['First', 'want', 'say', 'more', 'anything', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'sad', 'case', 'study', 'how', 'take', 'beautiful', 'material', 'completely', 'destroy', 'it.The', 'first', 'mistake', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'faithful', 'excellent', 'classic', 'short', 'story', 'same', 'name', 'Charlotte', 'Perkins', 'Gilman', 'Had', 'actually', 'made', 'movie', 'was', 'faithful', 'excellent', 'work', 'then', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'so', 'awful', 'end', 'included', 'just', 'enough', 'references', 'short', 'story', 'such', 'character', 'names', 'title', 'daughter', 'etc', 'cash', 'fame', 'short', 'story', 'changed', 'enough', 'storyline', 'making', 'husband', 'central', 'character', 'pathetic', 'ending', 'make', 'movie', 'horrible.While', 'not', 'bad', 'bad', 'portions', 'so', 'completely', 'good', 'will', 'find', 'wondering', 'why', 'wasted', 'time.The', 'Good:1', 'performances', 'females', '.especially', 'Juliet', 'Landau', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'movie', 'had', 'actually', 'been', 'faithful', 'representation', 'short', 'story', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'film', '..Juliet', 'Landau', 'Veronica', 'Cartwright', 'Michael', 'Moriarty', 'Dale', 'Dickey', 'deliver', 'subtle', 'yet', 'thoughtful', 'performances', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'possibly', 'could', 'have', 'considering', 'bad', 'writing', 'end', 'film', 'felt', 'sorry', 'them.2', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'appropriate', 'film', 'Especially', 'backlit', 'scenes.The', 'Bad:1', 'disjointed', 'irrelevant', 'scenes', 'Particularly', 'duel', 'desert', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'film', 'provide', 'explanation', 'add', 'nothing', 'story.2', 'predictable', 'easy', 'way', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'So', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'building', 'suspense', 'ending', 'fairly', 'anticlimactic.3', 'music', 'completely', 'top', 'melodramatic', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'So', 'bad', 'fact', 'times', 'laughable', 'desperately', 'create', 'sense', 'fear', 'suspense', 'building', 'almost', 'manic', 'crescendo', 'then', 'sunny', 'scene', 'front', 'house', 'sort', 'thing', 'so', 'often', 'when', 'scene', 'might', 'truly', 'be', 'scary', 'music', 'now', 'ineffective', 'have', 'learned', 'ignore', 'it.The', 'Ugly:1', 'truly', 'horrible', 'job', 'lead', 'actor', 'Aric', 'Cushing', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'actors', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'performance', 'so', 'deadpan', 'uninspired', 'anyone', 'street', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'Compound', 'fact', 'not', 'only', 'main', 'character', 'also', 'narrator', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'got', 'part', 'read', 'IMDB', 'also', 'credited', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'Ahhhhh', 'lot.2', 'disjointed', 'nature', 'movie', 'filmmakers', 'took', 'just', 'enough', 'details', 'short', 'story', 'intrigue', 'yet', 'change', 'enough', 'movie', 'make', 'seem', 'were', 'just', 'capitalizing', 'fame', 'short', 'story', 'Case', 'point', 'title', 'Yellow', 'Wallpaper', 'would', 'imagine', 'would', 'least', 'have', 'role', 'story', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'out', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'one', 'concept', 'changed', 'midway', '.hence', 'duel', 'desert', 'scenes', 'almost', 'seem', 'be', 'added', 'filler', 'choice', 'focus', 'husband', 'main', 'character', 'especially', 'when', 'portrayed', 'such', 'inept', 'actor', 'extremely', 'disappointing.Despite', 'questionable', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'invite', 'see', 'judge', 'what', 'say', 'true', 'can', 'stay', 'awake']",The Yellow Wallpaper
