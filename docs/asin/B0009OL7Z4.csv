909334,AIJ3JAT8596TA,B0009OL7Z4,A. Browning,"[1, 4]","I rented this movie because I am a fan of romantic comedies and this looked good from the box. I was wrong. I watched about half of it even though the first half was really clunky and poorly written. None of the actors say their lines with ANY feeling whatsoever. Debra Messing looks really old, pale and too thin. Her acting is poor and it looks like she has never been on a stage before. Dermot Mulrooney plays a sarcastic gigolo she hires to makes her ex jealous at her sister's wedding. But then she freaks out when her ex seems to like her still. I stopped watching after she slept with the gigolo and pretended like she didn't remember. He was already acting like he was in love with her. Please! If he was a real gigolo he is not going to fall in love with her just because they slept together or that she kissed him at some bar! It was really unbelievable. Even though I didn't watch anymore after the that, I can predict the rest of the plot.....she pretends like she doesn't like him, he likes her, then her ex wants her back and she think she wants him, but she actually wants the other guy. It's been done to death! But it was done in a hundred other movies by much better actors and with much better supporting characters.

909343,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0009OL7Z4,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Okay, so I like the brainless romantic comedy as much as the next person.  I like to sit back and shut off and soak in all the delightful predictable goodness.  I have no qualms with a simple plot, no matter how rehashed and generic it may be AS LONG AS THE ELEMENTS ALL COME TOGETHER and sadly, in `The Wedding Date', they do not.The first requirement to any successful romantic comedy is chemistry.  It is not `good looks' as some may believe.  Those may be the second most important requirement, it is not the first.  Before any romantic comedy can be worth watching it has to sport some amazing chemistry.  This film lacks that immensely.In fact, no one in this film is even remotely memorable, engaging or exciting.Amy Adams, who has made a career out of her mousy loveliness, is so far removed from everything I love about her.  Sure, she does the same hyper-sensitive quip that made her famous, but there is not emotion here to make it even borderline interesting.  She's just annoying, with no real depth to her shtick (and this pains me because I absolutely adore her).  Debra Messing is not really my cup of tea to begin with, but she meshed so well with Eric McCormack on `Will & Grace' that I kind of fell for her on the show.  Here she has her moments (and she carries her character well) but she doesn't have any spark with that charmless hack known as Dermot Mulroney (yes, I said charmLESS).The film's premise is simple.  Kat is going to her sisters wedding in England but she has a dilemma.  Her sister's husbands `best man' is Kat's ex-fianc&eacute; and she wants him to realize what he lost out on, so, despite the fact that she is desperate and alone she hires a male escort to pretend to be her boyfriend and accompany her to the wedding.  Even in all its predictable clich&eacute;d construction, a good romantic comedy at least establishes an interesting premise.  Thankfully `The Wedding Date' does that to a degree, but its failure to create any chemistry destroys all promise it had in the original prose.The film is really poorly constructed as well.  There is no real character development (there is no reason for Kat and Nick to fall in love, at all, yet they do as expected) and there is no real believability here either.  I remember thinking ""no one talks this way to their friends and family"" especially during Kat's mothers rather insulting speech at the initial party.  It's just not believable at all, especially not for this brand of comedy.Oh yeah, and as far as the whole `good looking' thing goes; well I know I'm just one person but neither of these two do anything for me, and Adams (who I normally find gorgeous) looks kind of cheap here.In the end I have to say that watching this film would be constituted highly unnecessary beings that there are many, many films in this same genre that topple over it.  Every year Hollywood churns out boatloads of worthless drivel.

909347,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B0009OL7Z4,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[3, 3]","Okay, okay, I admit it.  My Fair Lady is a big budget musical take off of G. B. Shaw's popular play ""Pygmalian,"" and Pretty Woman is the modest budget, modern take off of My Fair Lady (sans music).  I enjoyed all three.  Now we have a flip side version of Pretty Woman with the hero being hired as escort by the heroine.  In the present company it comes off rather bland.  That said I still enjoyed it as a light comedy/romance.Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman is sort of the ""design a woman kit"" for Richard Gere's character, just as Eliza Doolittle is for the Professor in My Fair Lady.  In the flip side version, however, Nick does not need any designing at all.  He comes fully preassembled and thoroughly competent from the start.  In a tradition that dates back to the screwball comedies of the 30's, the charming, self contained escort-for-hire is disarmed by the purchaser of his services.  She seems totally at a loss as to how to approach their actual business relationship, afraid that he will misconstrue her intentions, feel in some way cheated, or make presumptions.  Their business conference in the coat room was quite comical, as she appologizes ad infinitum.  Kat's helplessness in the presence of her selfish, self-centered half-sister, and crazy mother and her devotion to her step-father make her rather dear, and apparently are the hero's motivation for finally falling in love with her.Like Richard Curtis' movies, this film has a cast of delightful secondary characters who make the movie move along better than it might have.  I especially enjoyed the in-your-face cousin who rescues Kat from herself on more than one occasion and seems to best understand her.  The quiet groom Edward, is quite dear, and when he chases his ex-best man out of the church and down the road it was a delight.  One part easily overlooked is that of the bike messenger who finds it difficult to liberate the message from its sender, ""You'll have to help me,"" she says.

However, it is simply another story of a frustrated spinster with issues, who hires a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney) she reads about in a Time magazine article to travel to London for her sister's London wedding. How new is this plot?Neither funny, nor remotely romantic, the Wedding Date slides over the storyline of deceptive sex by bride and best man, and paid for escorts to pass off the film as Four Weddings without Hugh, and definitely, a dead end deal for the naive groom who is ignorant to the sexual history of his bride (Amy Adams).

909354,A34PAZQ73SL163,B0009OL7Z4,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[16, 49]","I must admit that one of my weakest areas of overall knowledge is the ""chick flick"" genre of film.  I basically avoid seeing movies designed to appeal specifically to women as I don't happen to be a female, and this, unfortunately, precludes my interest in a good deal of the Harlequinisms passed off as blockbusters by the motion picture industry.However, that's not to say that I haven't been exposed to many of these specialty productions because I have, although, generally, under duress.  The foulest one I ever experienced was Bridges of Madison Country which not even Clint Eastwood could enhance.  It was a monstrously clich&eacute;-ridden calamity.  I recall walking around the theatre lobby every half hour before reluctantly reentering to be mauled until the movie ungraciously ended.  Slightly better was the J-lo vehicle, The Wedding Planner, because I saw it at the Brew & View where I could ogle audience members instead of the film, and also numb myself with two dollar Miller Lights.Despite my smugness regarding this anti-art form, I happened to be sitting on a plane yesterday for a three hour plus flight, and, to kill time, connected my headphones to the chair allowing me to see and hear the recently released, Wedding Date.  I knew it wasn't going to be meaningful or educational, but I had little else to do in my coach seat.  Reading was not a possibility as the Vegas sun had deprived me of most of my alertness and concentration.The biggest compliment I can give the movie is that it was not as awful as I thought it would be, yet there's no reason to beat around the church pews here.  Its overall effect is to insult the intelligence of intelligent, or average to low average functioning, viewers.  The plot is bizarre and must have been written by a serious lu-lu because it brims with more irrationality than Charles Manson. Luckily, there are no swastika tattoos inked onto any of the characters, but that's the best thing that can be said about this big screen moronity.Debra Messing is the main character and she calls a gigolo to arrange his attendance at her sister's wedding in England.  They then fly to the British Isles together in an attempt to make Messing feel secure for the weekend while also arousing jealousy in her ex-fianc&eacute;. Immediately, the main character's physical beauty delegitimizes the plotline.  Even though the story is fifth class, Debra Messing is a first class beauty whose face is a pleasure to see.  Her body is equally radiant, but her rich, scarlet locks may be her strongest feature as they transfix one's eyes for the film's duration.  Yet, physiognomy is the beginning and end of her merits.  As far as acting talent is concerned, she's been powerfully whacked by the B-movie stick.  Messing is not just a poor actress; she's a horrendous actress. Many of her lines make you wince and Mulroney, no Olivier himself, is quite competent in comparison.Yet, it gets far worse.  Mulroney's character makes one wonder about the rationality of those charmed by Wedding Date.  The question, ""are logic and reason dead?"", must be posed.  Here we have a male escort, read: prostitute, who supposedly offers sex as a secondary element for his business transactions.  Maybe it is to his somewhat rare female customers, but it would not be to the 90 to 100 percent of his clientele who happen to be male.  It is amazing that Messing falls in love with him yet she never inquires about his bisexuality or homosexuality.  It is the fate male gigolos to service males-period.  What woman would not be concerned about having a sexual partner with a gay and completely unknown past?  Obviously, not Ms. Messing who gets drunk and then proceeds to have unprotected sex with Mulroney on her father-in-law's boat.  Nice!Wedding Date was crafted with society's lowest common denominator in mind, and I'm sure it will not fail to appeal to its base.

909365,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B0009OL7Z4,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[3, 5]","""Wedding Date"" is one of those movies that really bug me. It's a light hearted, silly comedy about a woman who wants to seek some personal revenge against her ex- fianc&eacute; and parts of it do succeed at entertaining the viewer. But there are other parts that had me rolling my eyes, leaving me with that frustrating feeling I often get following a mediocre film. It is so much on the borderline between good and bad that the slightest shift in momentum could cause it to succeed or fail in the eyes of the viewer.The basic plot of this movie is appealing in a weird way. Here we have an attractive woman who hires a male prostitute to escort her to her sister's wedding. Her former fianc&eacute; is going to be there, and to add to the fun, he is the groom's best man. The woman's motive isn't to find romance with this escort. All she wants to do is annoy her ex fianc&eacute; and seek revenge for him dumping her a few years back. Like I said, the plot is interesting, if only because it isn't something that has been attempted in many films before and it offers all sorts of possibilities for a creative director.Probably the best parts of this movie are some of its one- liners. I'm not the first person to say that many of them will stick out in your memory long after you watch this movie. Some of them are memorable for their humor; others for their deeper meanings. But regardless of the reason, they are good and they will remain in your memory.As far as the rest of the movie, well, much of it is forgettable. The fianc&eacute;, played by Jeremy Sheffield, is a bumbling mess in this film and his contribution to the enjoyment of the movie was minimal. The same could be said of Peter Egan in the role as Kat's father. He is ok, but he doesn't really add much to the movie. And the plot itself, while fairly original, doesn't get the creative spark from director Clare Kilner that it deserved. There are so many things Kilner could have done to make this movie more enjoyable. But Kilner sticks with silliness for the most part and neglected the opportunity to make this a more intelligent comedy.With the other performers, the standout among them is Dermot Mulroney as Nick, the male escort. Mulroney fits the part well, and he is so charming and smart that you really don't care anymore that he makes a living collecting money for favors. I really like Debra Messing, too, as an actress and she is good in this movie, although her performance is a notch below that of her co- star, Mulroney. Messing is best known for her starring role on the television hit series Will and Grace and her success on the small screen will likely lead to more and more offers to star on the big screen. She is good here, and it should enhance her resume and result in more starring roles in the future.So now comes the hard part: deciding how to rate this movie. I feel it is a 2.5 star film in every way, with some good humor, some goofy humor, and directing that is uninspired but acceptable for the most part. This movie walks a tightrope between ""acceptable"" and ""not recommended"" and I am torn between two and three stars so I am going to flip a coin and give Wedding Date...........three stars out of five and the slimmest recommendation possible. Some viewers will like the one- liners and the performances by the leads and these are the only ingredients that make this movie date bearable. It's the type of date that is better than no date at all, but that leaves you wondering why you didn't just stay in bed.",4,An Attractive Woman and her Male Escort,1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,3515,"['Wedding', 'Date', 'one', 'movies', 'really', 'bug', 'light', 'hearted', 'silly', 'comedy', 'woman', 'who', 'seek', 'personal', 'revenge', 'ex-', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'parts', 'do', 'succeed', 'entertaining', 'viewer', 'are', 'other', 'parts', 'had', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'leaving', 'frustrating', 'feeling', 'often', 'get', 'following', 'mediocre', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'borderline', 'good', 'bad', 'slightest', 'shift', 'momentum', 'could', 'cause', 'succeed', 'fail', 'eyes', 'viewer.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'movie', 'appealing', 'weird', 'way', 'Here', 'have', 'attractive', 'woman', 'who', 'male', 'prostitute', 'escort', 'sister', 'wedding', 'former', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'going', 'be', 'there', 'add', 'fun', 'groom', 'best', 'man', 'woman', 'motive', ""n't"", 'find', 'romance', 'escort', 'do', 'annoy', 'ex', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'seek', 'revenge', 'dumping', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'said', 'plot', 'interesting', 'only', ""n't"", 'something', 'been', 'attempted', 'many', 'films', 'sorts', 'possibilities', 'creative', 'director.Probably', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'one-', 'liners', ""'m"", 'not', 'first', 'person', 'say', 'many', 'will', 'stick', 'out', 'memory', 'long', 'watch', 'movie', 'are', 'memorable', 'humor', 'others', 'deeper', 'meanings', 'regardless', 'reason', 'are', 'good', 'will', 'remain', 'memory.As', 'far', 'rest', 'movie', 'well', 'much', 'forgettable', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'played', 'Jeremy', 'Sheffield', 'bumbling', 'mess', 'film', 'contribution', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'was', 'minimal', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Peter', 'Egan', 'role', 'Kat', 'father', 'ok', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'much', 'movie', 'plot', 'fairly', 'original', ""n't"", 'get', 'creative', 'spark', 'director', 'Clare', 'Kilner', 'deserved', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'Kilner', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Kilner', 'sticks', 'silliness', 'most', 'part', 'neglected', 'opportunity', 'make', 'more', 'intelligent', 'comedy.With', 'other', 'performers', 'standout', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'Nick', 'male', 'escort', 'Mulroney', 'part', 'well', 'so', 'charming', 'smart', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'anymore', 'living', 'collecting', 'money', 'favors', 'really', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'too', 'actress', 'good', 'movie', 'performance', 'notch', 'co-', 'star', 'Mulroney', 'Messing', 'best', 'known', 'starring', 'role', 'television', 'hit', 'series', 'Will', 'Grace', 'success', 'small', 'screen', 'will', 'likely', 'lead', 'more', 'more', 'offers', 'star', 'big', 'screen', 'good', 'here', 'should', 'enhance', 'resume', 'result', 'more', 'starring', 'roles', 'future.So', 'now', 'hard', 'part', 'deciding', 'how', 'rate', 'movie', 'feel', '2.5', 'star', 'film', 'way', 'good', 'humor', 'goofy', 'humor', 'directing', 'uninspired', 'acceptable', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'tightrope', 'acceptable', 'not', 'recommended', 'am', 'torn', 'two', 'three', 'stars', 'so', 'am', 'going', 'flip', 'coin', 'give', 'Wedding', 'Date', '..three', 'stars', 'five', 'slimmest', 'recommendation', 'possible', 'viewers', 'will', 'like', 'one-', 'liners', 'performances', 'leads', 'are', 'only', 'ingredients', 'make', 'movie', 'date', 'bearable', 'type', 'date', 'better', 'date', 'wondering', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'stay', 'bed']",N/A

909370,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B0009OL7Z4,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 2]","""The Wedding Date"" tells of what happens when Kat Ellis (Debra Messing) hires male escort extraordinaire Nick Mercer (Dermot Mulroney) to accompany her to her sister's wedding, posing as her boyfriend. She can't face her ex- fianc&eacute; without the crutch, not to mention her toxic mother, (Holland Taylor) Bunny. But what begins as a purely financial transaction soon morphs into true love, or so this movie would have you believe, but I'm not buying it.I wasn't asking much, just a bit of light entertainment, a diversion. I was diverted, but most of the fun was unintentional humor and disecting the corpse, and determining where and how the movie went terribly wrong. The story could have been made into a decent entertainment, but what little charm there was was spoiled by sloppy editing and poor direction from Clare Kilner.I guess I got off on the wrong foot with this movie, because I thought that Rupert Everrett was the lead, and that was pointing to a whole different d&eacute;nouement, if you catch my drift. I think somehow I was getting it mixed up with ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" which starred both Rupert and Derrmot Mulroney, along with Julia Roberts. I was confused when all the Brits made fun of Dermot's American accent, and thought he was playing against character (in more ways than one). Actually, he is from Virginia, and not only does he act, he also plays Cello. No kidding, and he even plays on some well known recordings.Why was the wedding in London, and why were all the characters British? I guess Kat's mother married a Limey, but why then do they all sound so American, if they grew up in England?Anyway, I like Debra Messing, and think she is very attractive and appealing. Her comedy works better when she has other funny people to react to. She of course played Grace on NBC's comedy, Will and Grace. I like her, and I also thought that Dermot Mulroney was doing a good job of acting, but I wasn't buying the romance between them. No chemistry whatsoever. I also like Holland Taylor who played Kat's mother, Bunny. She is Evelyn Harper on ""Two and a Half Men,"" mother to the two men, and grandmother to the half man, and does an excellent job of portraying a Malibu Real Estate Agent. I like her, and she could have been good in ""The Wedding Date,"" but alas, wasn't given much to work with, and what little she had was apparantly cast down on the cutting room floor.I watched the deleted scenes and found a lot of things that only made sense once you saw them. Why the director choose to discard the exculpatory evidence is beyond me. For instance, Kat, her sister, and all the women from the wedding party are shown pub crawling, and they refer to the drinks as holes. For instance they speak of the seventh hole. But you aren't shown the scene where Kat describes ""Pub Golf"" where you go from pub to pub drinking a ""hole"" at each one until you make it to the 18th pub. Also, you lose points for vomiting, but not as many points are lost if you remember to yell ""Fore!"" Perhaps I should be grateful that a scene of gratuitous projectile vomiting was also omitted.There was also a scene where Bunny described the pivotal moment where Kat and her sister went from inseparable sisters to sibling rivals. This was cut, and it would have done a lot to explain their complicated relationship, but would have been too little too late, and besides I didn't really care about the sister at all because she wasn't three dimensional, two dimensional, or even one dimensional, she was like zero dimensional. Bo-ring. Don't care. Not buying it.One other thing that made little or no sense was that Nick Mercer was supposed to have written an article for the New Yorker that said that ""woman wind up with the relationship they want"" or words to that effect slightly paraphrased, and Kat's British step father quotes it in a conversation with Nick. Not buying any of it. Not buying that the step father read it, or that he would quote it unbeknownst that he was talking to the author, and not buying that Nick wrote the article, in spite of his back story of a degree in Comparative Literature from Brown University. Not buying it at all. Like Kat, who found that paying for ""it"" was morally repugnant, I'm not buying it.Pretty Woman (15th Anniversary Special Edition)American GigoloMy Best Friend's Wedding (Special Edition)Wedding

Well...the plot is not unlike most romantic comedies or ""chick flicks"" out there, but the plot was similar to a novel I read a while back but couldn't remember the title at the time.  This is based on the novel Asking for Trouble by Elizabeth Young.  I wasn't impressed with the novel and I have to say that I wasn't impressed with the film either, but for different reasons.  Kat Ellis (Debra Messing) doesn't want to go to her half-sister's wedding in London without a date, for her ex-fianc&eacute; is the best man.  Desperate times call for desperate measures and she hires a male escort (Dermot Mulroney) to pass as her boyfriend to make her ex jealous.  Things seem to go well for her and attraction ensues between Kat and Nick, but then she uncovers a terrible secret during the rehearsal dinner.**This second portion of the review contains spoilers.  Read at your own risk.**  I agree with the people who said this is similar to Pretty Woman and My Best Friend's Wedding, except that this one isn't half as fun or as entertaining as the aforementioned two movies.  In fact, this film is uneven, unamusing and pointless.  The scenes are all over the place.  It appears to be quite poorly edited.  One moment Kat sees Nick as nothing but a tool to make her ex-fianc&eacute; jealous and the next thing I know she has a drunken one-night stand with him.  And you know how in some movies, despite its weak plot, the chemistry between the leads is so hot that it doesn't matter that the rest of the film sucks?  Well, you won't find that here.  I felt no heat between these two leads.  Debra Messing is very pretty and she's a great actress, but with the exception of the scene where she confronts her sister her performance is wooden and one-dimensional.  At times I felt she was playing Grace Adler from Will and Grace all over again.  And Dermot Mulroney is gorgeous and I enjoyed getting an eyeful of his great bod, but his role could've been played by Hugh Jackman, Matthew McConaughey or any other romantic comedy poster boy.  Nothing stood out from this character.  The Wedding Date is populated by unlikeable characters who get away with the disgusting things they do.  Ugh.  The only good things about this film is Jack Davenport (whose character is kind of a dork, but is about one of the very few likeable characters here), the lovely scenes filmed in England's Lake District and the awesome soundtrack.  This film contains some wonderful songs.  Other than that, this is a waste of time.  I can't believe I bought this previewed at a DVD rental. I won't buy a film like this before watching it first again.

909383,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B0009OL7Z4,Cubist,"[9, 16]","The problem that faces a lot of TV actors is making the jump from the small screen to the big one. Quite often they are so closely identified with the show they're on because you can see them on it all the time. In the case of Debra Messing, who is on the show Will and Grace, you can see her virtually every day thanks to syndication. Because an actor is so closely identified with a popular role it is hard for audiences to see them in another, different one. This may explain why we haven't seen too many film roles from the cast of Will and Grace. In Messing's case she's done a few (namely, Along Came Polly and the underrated Mothman Prophecies) between seasons of her show, the latest being The Wedding Date.The Wedding Date is really a hybrid of My Best Friend's Wedding in terms of plot with the aesthetic of Bridget Jones's Diary in terms of dialogue and character types. Like the latter film, The Wedding Date features some beautiful cinematography, by Oliver Curtis, that gives the same kind of glamourous glow to London as in that movie.This movie was misunderstood, misinterpreted and misrepresented-just plain missed-by the critics and audiences. Why? The Wedding Date is a well-written and well-made movie but perhaps audiences wanted Messing to reprise her Grace character. In this day and age when outrageous, gross-out comedies like The Wedding Crashers are at the top of the box office, it is refreshing to see a movie like The Wedding Date that has its own ebb and flow, a laid-back vibe for a more mature audience. This movie was the victim of a misleading ad campaign and an indifferent movie-going public but is actually a surprisingly intelligent romantic comedy.There are eight deleted scenes. They do flesh out more of the story and the interactions between characters. These scenes are nice to see but were rightly cut.""A Date with Debra"" is a Q&A; session with Messing. She talks about what attracted her to the script-it was a fun premise with a dark edge to it.Finally, there is an audio commentary by Debra Messing. She often falls into the trap of spending too much time watching the movie and forgetting to comment on it or when she does it is only brief factoids and obvious observations.",5,"Misunderstood, misinterpreted & misrepresented-just plain missed",1124668800,"08 22, 2005",2005,2223,"['problem', 'lot', 'TV', 'actors', 'making', 'jump', 'small', 'screen', 'big', 'one', 'Quite', 'often', 'are', 'so', 'closely', 'identified', 'show', ""'re"", 'can', 'see', 'time', 'case', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'who', 'show', 'Will', 'Grace', 'can', 'see', 'virtually', 'day', 'thanks', 'syndication', 'actor', 'so', 'closely', 'identified', 'popular', 'role', 'hard', 'audiences', 'see', 'different', 'one', 'may', 'explain', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'film', 'roles', 'cast', 'Will', 'Grace', 'Messing', 'case', 'done', 'few', 'namely', 'Came', 'Polly', 'underrated', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'seasons', 'show', 'latest', 'being', 'Wedding', 'Date.The', 'Wedding', 'Date', 'really', 'hybrid', 'My', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'terms', 'plot', 'aesthetic', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'terms', 'dialogue', 'character', 'types', 'latter', 'film', 'Wedding', 'Date', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Oliver', 'Curtis', 'same', 'kind', 'glamourous', 'glow', 'London', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'was', 'misunderstood', 'misinterpreted', 'misrepresented-just', 'plain', 'missed-by', 'critics', 'audiences', 'Why', 'Wedding', 'Date', 'well-written', 'well-made', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'audiences', 'wanted', 'Messing', 'reprise', 'Grace', 'character', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'outrageous', 'gross-out', 'comedies', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'are', 'top', 'box', 'office', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'Wedding', 'Date', 'own', 'ebb', 'flow', 'laid-back', 'vibe', 'more', 'mature', 'audience', 'movie', 'was', 'victim', 'misleading', 'ad', 'campaign', 'indifferent', 'movie-going', 'public', 'actually', 'surprisingly', 'intelligent', 'romantic', 'are', 'eight', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'do', 'flesh', 'more', 'story', 'interactions', 'characters', 'scenes', 'are', 'nice', 'see', 'were', 'rightly', 'cut', 'Date', 'Debra', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'Messing', 'what', 'attracted', 'script-it', 'was', 'fun', 'premise', 'dark', 'edge', 'it.Finally', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'often', 'trap', 'spending', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'forgetting', 'comment', 'when', 'only', 'brief', 'factoids', 'obvious', 'observations']",N/A

909397,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,B0009OL7Z4,DonAthos,"[5, 11]","Usually when we go to the video store, my girlfriend and I rent two movies--one of her choosing and one of mine. Predictably, I normally pick something out from the action or horror aisle and she picks up a romantic comedy or drama. We then watch them both together, and regarding the ""chick flicks""... well... really, I don't honestly mind, usually. I consider myself a fairly romantic kind-of-guy, and so I like romantic movies, too. What's not to like about seeing a wonderful man and a wonderful woman realize that they're wonderful for each other, despite the obstacles keeping them apart, and then fight to be together? And so, as we rung it up at the register, I felt ready and willing to take on The Wedding Date. Even looking forward to it.Well, I was in for a disappointment. The male lead--a professional escort/hooker--was wooden, unemotional, uninteresting and, if anything, kind of rude. If the female lead wasn't such a neurotic and emotional wreck (paying $6000 + airfare to London for a wedding date to make an ex-boyfriend jealous), I would seriously wonder how in the world she could wind up falling for such a guy. The film seems to expect us to find him ""perfect"" because he is, apparently, good-looking, and has the other vapid women in the movie continually fawning over him. Not because he's particularly charming, intelligent, nice or interesting, but because he's handsome. Yawn.The grand ""love scene"" in the film occurs when the female lead, drunk out of her gourd, cashes out at a local ATM so she can buy sex from the hooker she's hired, despite the fact that she said paying for sex was completely against her principles just a day and a half prior. I guess he must have won her over by... doing nothing and just standing there, looking pretty.The movie gives us little reason to like her, less reason to like him, and no reason to believe that their ultimate relationship is based on anything other than desperation, lust and drinking binges. That the movie supposes them to develop some sort of real love over a few days attending a wedding party, given the circumstances of their characters, is absurd at best, and makes me cringe at the thought of some women finding it ""romantic."" Romance is more than a strong jaw, ladies.Thankfully, I think that there are some women who don't buy into this kind of pulp; after the film, my girlfriend commented on the lameness of the ""love scene,"" the lameness of some of the lines, and the fact that she didn't think their relationship had a shot at lasting. She also said that she found the movie ""more British than she had expected."" I think what she meant was, she was expecting something romantic, and got something uninteresting and heartless.Apart from the storyline, the film itself is only of middling quality. The writing is cheesy at times and uninspired at others, with only a few laughs coming at the very beginning. The editors did a horrible job--some plot lines I only understood after watching the ""deleted scenes"" included on the disc. The acting was ho-hum, servicable, but none of the characters were interesting or deep enough to really require a lot of acting power. All-around, this film leaves very little to recommend it.In a word, lame.",1,"Is This *Really* a ""Chick Flick""?

909401,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0009OL7Z4,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","I didn't have many expectations going into this early 2005 movie since it seemed like one of those studio concoctions that give away the whole predictable plot in its trailer. For the most part, I am not mistaken in my preconceived notion, as this is indeed a featherweight romantic comedy wherein director Clare Kilner seems intent on doing a gender reversal on ""Pretty Woman"" with a heavy dollop of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" on top and even doing a sly tweak on the Walls of Jericho scene from ""It Happened One Night"". This is the kind of confection that depends almost entirely on the appeal of its star.Luckily, Debra Messing has sharpened her comedy skills after years on the wonderful though sometimes wavering ""Will & Grace"" and gets a rare opportunity to carry a film on her own. She stars as Kat Ellis, a mid-thirtyish, Manhattan-based woman, who decides to hire Nick Mercer, a male escort chosen right out of the classifieds, in order to accompany her to her younger sister's London wedding where the best man is Jeffrey, Kat's ex-fianc&eacute;e, who dumped her after seven years. The Lifetime TV movie-like premise is as contrived as it sounds, but Messing - despite years of abuse from Jack and Karen on the small screen - is inarguably beautiful with a nice, self-deprecating awareness about her and an impressive gift for physical comedy. Truth be told, she is just another variation on Grace Adler without Grace's clinginess and screeching operetta singing voice.Helping her keep things afloat is Dermot Mulroney, an actor who has kept himself under the radar for years but seems to alternate between high-profile chick flicks (""My Best Friend's Wedding"") and more interesting fare (""About Schmidt""). He makes palatable his no-win role as the ideal man of the world by underplaying the stereotype and mostly observing the proceedings. The rest of the movie is hardly worth going into, except to say that first-time screenwriter Dana Fox provides some good lines, predictable plot turns, and an interesting and quite unexpected note of melancholy toward the inevitably happy ending. There are some amusing sideline performances, in particular, a brassy Sarah Parish as Kat's man-hungry best friend and Victor Ellis as her supportive stepfather. An underused Holland Taylor plays her typically vituperative character, this time as Kat's edgy mother.The DVD extras seem pretty sparse and focused squarely on Messing. She offers the only voice on the alternate audio commentary track, and while she is likeable and as informative as she can be from her perspective, there is no one else to bounce thoughts against or provide more a of a behind-the-scenes perspective. If that is not enough, there is an eight-minute interview with Messing with film clips interspersed, and ten minutes of deleted scenes which I frankly did not bother to watch. This is all lighthearted fare which will not disappoint Messing's fans and anyone else in need of an undemanding, clich&eacute;-ridden romance novel of a comedy.",3,Expect the Expected...But Messing Carries the Film With Confidence,1131235200,"11 6, 2005",2005,3020,"['did', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'expectations', 'going', 'early', '2005', 'movie', 'seemed', 'one', 'studio', 'concoctions', 'give', 'away', 'whole', 'predictable', 'plot', 'trailer', 'most', 'part', 'am', 'not', 'mistaken', 'preconceived', 'notion', 'indeed', 'featherweight', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'wherein', 'director', 'Clare', 'Kilner', 'intent', 'doing', 'gender', 'reversal', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'heavy', 'dollop', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'top', 'even', 'doing', 'sly', 'tweak', 'Walls', 'Jericho', 'scene', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'kind', 'confection', 'almost', 'entirely', 'appeal', 'star.Luckily', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'sharpened', 'comedy', 'skills', 'years', 'wonderful', 'sometimes', 'wavering', 'Will', 'Grace', 'rare', 'opportunity', 'carry', 'film', 'own', 'Kat', 'Ellis', 'mid-thirtyish', 'Manhattan-based', 'woman', 'who', 'hire', 'Nick', 'Mercer', 'male', 'escort', 'chosen', 'right', 'classifieds', 'order', 'accompany', 'younger', 'sister', 'London', 'wedding', 'where', 'best', 'man', 'Jeffrey', 'Kat', 'ex-fianc', 'eacute', 'who', 'dumped', 'seven', 'years', 'Lifetime', 'TV', 'movie-like', 'premise', 'as', 'contrived', 'Messing', 'years', 'abuse', 'Jack', 'Karen', 'small', 'screen', 'inarguably', 'beautiful', 'nice', 'self-deprecating', 'awareness', 'impressive', 'gift', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'just', 'variation', 'Grace', 'Adler', 'Grace', 'clinginess', 'screeching', 'operetta', 'singing', 'voice.Helping', 'keep', 'things', 'afloat', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'actor', 'who', 'kept', 'radar', 'years', 'alternate', 'high-profile', 'chick', 'flicks', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'more', 'interesting', 'fare', 'Schmidt', 'palatable', 'no-win', 'role', 'ideal', 'man', 'world', 'underplaying', 'stereotype', 'mostly', 'observing', 'proceedings', 'rest', 'movie', 'hardly', 'worth', 'going', 'say', 'first-time', 'screenwriter', 'Dana', 'Fox', 'good', 'lines', 'predictable', 'plot', 'turns', 'interesting', 'quite', 'unexpected', 'note', 'melancholy', 'inevitably', 'happy', 'ending', 'are', 'amusing', 'sideline', 'performances', 'particular', 'brassy', 'Sarah', 'Parish', 'Kat', 'man-hungry', 'best', 'friend', 'Victor', 'Ellis', 'supportive', 'stepfather', 'underused', 'Holland', 'Taylor', 'typically', 'vituperative', 'character', 'time', 'Kat', 'edgy', 'mother.The', 'DVD', 'seem', 'pretty', 'sparse', 'focused', 'squarely', 'Messing', 'only', 'voice', 'alternate', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'likeable', 'as', 'informative', 'can', 'be', 'perspective', 'one', 'else', 'bounce', 'thoughts', 'provide', 'more', 'behind-the-scenes', 'perspective', 'not', 'enough', 'eight-minute', 'interview', 'Messing', 'film', 'clips', 'interspersed', 'ten', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'frankly', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'watch', 'lighthearted', 'fare', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Messing', 'fans', 'anyone', 'else', 'need', 'undemanding', 'clich', 'eacute', '-ridden', 'romance', 'novel', 'comedy']",N/A

This film stars Debra Messing (of ""Will & Grace"" fame) and Dermot Mulroney. The film is a combination My Best Friend's Wedding meets Pretty Woman, or in this case Pretty Man or Not-So Pretty Man depending on your taste in men.The problem with this film is that there is absolutely no chemistry, nada, nunca, nil, zero, zilch between these two actors. At least in Pretty Woman, Julia had a reason why she was a prostitute; in this film Dermot (Nick Mercer) revels in his profession, to the point of having an article written about it in a magazine. In which everyone, to include people living in England, has read; and can quote passages from.The premise of the movie is that Kat Ellis (Messing) must return to England for her half-sister's wedding, in which her former fianc&eacute; (Edward) is the Best Man. Unable to secure a date for the event, Kat decides to hire a professional male escort for the job. His fee for this service is six grand, and that does not include his sexual services; which would run an extra $3500 a pop. I only know this, because the Nick Mercer character thrives at self exploitation, and his total god's-gift-to-woman attitude is just nauseating after time.Thrown in the fact, that Kat's family is a bunch of alcoholics, her half-sister's a slut (who also banged Kat's fianc&eacute;), Kat's cousin TJ is both; and we have a real winner of a flick on our hands.Not to mention the hardly fathomable ending in which everything just comes together all peachy keenly. I'm insulted to have the groom of this film even associated with the male species.

You have to think of her outside of her Will and Grace persona to get a feel for the character she plays in this movie. Kat Ellis hires a top of the line male escort to pose as her boyfriend in order to not appear solo at her sister's wedding as well as put off her ex-fiancee who dumped her. But the real issue resided in her step father's own words, ""Ever since you were a little girl, you spent your whole life worrying about what other people think.  What do you think, Kat?""Dermott is absolutely smashing as the suave, baritone and rakishly handsome male escort. His demeanor is calm, bluntly honest without sounding too philisophical and unbelieveably sexy, exuding a confidence that is utterly irresistible. Yet he is a professional and unshakably business-like. He does exactly what he is supposed to do...support Kat, highlight Kat's attributes and takes nothing away from her spotlight.  A lot of his role is silent.  Of course, in the end he ends up falling for her but not with the typical ""I can't live without you"" campiness. Dermott plays the part so well that you wonder if he's had some experience.I love the sexy innuendos in the movie. They're not over the top.  The movie explores darker familial and relationship issues, but the reactions are honest, which is somewhat surprising because you don't expect that in a romantic comedy. It put a nice finesse to the old Hollywood romantic comedy formula: pretty yet quirky girl seeks love and solace in handsome know-it-all.

Yes, they end up together, go figure but the point is, it's different. It's fun and playful and the relationships in the movie are more than accurate. There are so many complicated relationships in life and this shows a good amount of them. This movie also plays on family and connects with people who feel isolated and alone. People who know their family loves them but for some reason they just can't get along. It shows an actual story that's not based on sex or way to focused on the romance.

I will tell you this ""Wedding Date"" is a tepid, unoriginal reworking of several other better films on the subject of weddings, such as ""4 Weddings and a Funeral"" & ""My Best Friends Wedding"" with a generous heaping helping of ""Pretty Woman"". Beautiful Kat (Debra Messing, revisiting her ""Will & Grace"" character by rote) pays $6000 for a male escort (Dermot Mulroney) to accompany her to her half-sister's wedding in England.I have to mention that ""Will & Grace"" in the first place is basically a reworking of the film ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" ANYHOW, with Ms. Messing filling in for the similarly long-red-haired Julia Roberts with a gay friend she is practically in love with, and in that film, Dermot Mulroney ALSO played her old boyfriend! Talk about referencing.""Wedding Date"" is based on a chik-lit novel, set in England, and the story is updated (unnecessarily and confusingly) with the lead actresses being American. This doesn't even make sense, as Kat and her sister are supposedly raised in England from a very young age, and yet both speak with American accents (especially odd for the sister who doesn't even LIVE in the US). It took me nearly half the film to even figure out their relationship, it was portrayed so confusingly.Mulroney and Messing have no sex appeal or chemistry together, and the dialogue is not witty or charming enough to carry the viewer across the many plot roles or unbelievable circumstances (such as: why a beautiful female like Kat has to hire a male prostitute, when any red-blooded man would be eager to date or escort her even). The reworking of the ""Pretty Woman"" plot line is very thin, as male prostitutes are much rarer than female and because we culturally find the idea of a woman paying for sexual pleasure sorta ""icky"", Kat never actually pays for sex and Dermot's character actually pays back his $6000 fee, thus negating the whole hooker/john(or ""jeanette"") relationship.Most of the romantic comedies that come out these days are made to make some money. It would be nice if they spent a little more time on them and would actually let their audience enjoy it more. There's really no reason to watch this unless your a die-hard fan of Messing or Mulroney but if your not then its better if you skip this, and for those who knows my reviews I barely say that. Again not a very memorable experience because it will quickly go right over your head once you finish viewing it.",2,My apologies to fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney but this film shed's no spark,1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,2480,"['saw', 'film', 'had', 'nothing', 'else', 'watch', 'will', 'tell', 'Wedding', 'Date', 'tepid', 'unoriginal', 'reworking', 'several', 'other', 'better', 'films', 'subject', 'weddings', 'such', '4', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'Best', 'Friends', 'Wedding', 'generous', 'heaping', 'helping', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Beautiful', 'Kat', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'revisiting', 'Will', 'Grace', 'character', 'rote', '6000', 'male', 'escort', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'accompany', 'half-sister', 'wedding', 'England.I', 'have', 'mention', 'Will', 'Grace', 'first', 'place', 'basically', 'reworking', 'film', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'ANYHOW', 'Ms.', 'Messing', 'filling', 'similarly', 'long-red-haired', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'gay', 'friend', 'practically', 'love', 'film', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'ALSO', 'played', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'Talk', 'referencing', 'Wedding', 'Date', 'based', 'chik-lit', 'novel', 'set', 'England', 'story', 'updated', 'unnecessarily', 'confusingly', 'lead', 'being', 'American', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'sense', 'Kat', 'sister', 'are', 'supposedly', 'raised', 'England', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'yet', 'speak', 'American', 'accents', 'especially', 'odd', 'sister', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'LIVE', 'US', 'took', 'nearly', 'film', 'even', 'figure', 'out', 'relationship', 'was', 'portrayed', 'so', 'confusingly.Mulroney', 'Messing', 'have', 'sex', 'appeal', 'chemistry', 'together', 'dialogue', 'not', 'witty', 'charming', 'enough', 'carry', 'viewer', 'many', 'plot', 'roles', 'unbelievable', 'circumstances', 'such', 'why', 'beautiful', 'female', 'Kat', 'hire', 'male', 'prostitute', 'when', 'red-blooded', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'eager', 'date', 'escort', 'even', 'reworking', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'plot', 'line', 'very', 'thin', 'male', 'prostitutes', 'are', 'much', 'rarer', 'female', 'culturally', 'find', 'idea', 'woman', 'paying', 'sexual', 'pleasure', 'sorta', 'icky', 'Kat', 'never', 'actually', 'sex', 'Dermot', 'character', 'actually', 'back', '6000', 'fee', 'thus', 'negating', 'whole', 'hooker/john', 'jeanette', 'relationship.Most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'come', 'days', 'are', 'made', 'make', 'money', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'spent', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'would', 'actually', 'let', 'audience', 'enjoy', 'more', 'really', 'reason', 'watch', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'Messing', 'Mulroney', 'not', 'then', 'better', 'skip', 'who', 'knows', 'reviews', 'barely', 'say', 'Again', 'not', 'very', 'memorable', 'experience', 'will', 'quickly', 'go', 'right', 'head', 'finish', 'viewing']",N/A

The possibility that one could be a woman's date to her sister's wedding, and come walking in and leave a mark, like the hand holding a pen and circling the wanted ad like a shark, would leave anyone in shock. Just like those who might think the phone book holds all the answers and is a cheap fix to other issues unaddressed by the searcher, who's eyes always long for acceptance from others, might actually find hapiness in a stranger if only for a brief occasion. The premise to this film and the method employed throughout is somewhat of an intriguing one, and indeed ultimately worth exploring. Although what I describe here seems so much more thrilling then what comes to the screen.This film did not have a very big budget but what it has captured is a noticable spark between the leads, and that is something neither character called for. Debra looks like a million dollars in her black dress and other elegant numbers. The cast is marvellous and you couldn't have found better, although I always see John Cusack in the cover and sometimes wish he could have been the man who really did wonders for Kate Beckinsale in 'Serendipity'. Maybe he was too expensive. Still Debra Messing was the real attraction here for me and Amy Adams is lovely as the sister as well as Holland Taylor who is funny.The Wedding Date could have gone in a slightly darker direction then what has become the finished product. With a short running time of eighty six minutes, every effort is made to create an impeccable, clean, fun film and it succeeds in doing so in every way possible. However it is this easy way out that lets the film down slightly. I love fun romantic films like this one, but every other wedding film feels like this. Had this film gone to a darker place it could well have been a real stand out among wedding films that thrive so often with happy endings. It could have really taken the cake and splatted it into the face of Hollywood, leaving the viewer to experience a rip-roaring romance that could really let its hair down, instead of half way through, and gone down any wild road, like that of elopement.The lack of any deleted scenes in the special features leaves the viewer without the option to see a side of a film that might have been. The only indication we have of changes in the original script is from Debra Messing's commentry, not the commentary promised on the DVD of director Clare Kilner. My DVD also has a theatrical trailer and A Date With Debra - Featurette. Debra Messing is clearly an actress preferring the darker side of the story not told. I don't see a sequel forthcoming. Still if you are after something reasonably light and relatively painless, The Wedding Date might just be the movie you're looking for.

I left the theater with a good feeling; that's a plus.However, the movie had rather large holes in it. Whenever people spoke to Nick (Dermot Mulroney), they spoke of him being very wise; in fact, Kat (Debra Messing) called him Yoda, after he said one thing to her that was wise. You got the impression that in the car ride that he may have been speaking to her about other things, but since we didn't see it, we didn't know. Directly *after* she referred to him as Yoda, he did elocute with wisdom, but that was after.Also - and this really isn't giving anything away because the previews in the theater and on television told us blatantly that this would happen - we have absolutely no idea why Nick fell in love with her, or why Kat fell in love with him. He was an escort who occasionally had emotionless sex with his clients. I have a hard time imagining her character just letting that go without seriously questioning herself, even if this is supposed to be a light romantic comedy.

There were some funny parts, but the main theme of the movie was supposed to be deep.  The dialogue and scenes did not support the deep, emotional theme that the movie was trying to go for.  There was way too much drama where it clearly didn't fit.  Most of the main guy's lines were cheesy or they tried to reach for depth where there was none.  The whole plot was random, too.  The focus is supposed to be on Debra Messing's character, but you get sidetracked by her sister's role.

909453,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0009OL7Z4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 4]","""The Wedding Date"" is a borderline film because it has so much working against it in terms of premise and predictability.  The premise is easily reducible to what we glean from the trailer: Kat Ellis (Debra Messing) has to go back home to England for the wedding of her sister, Amy (Amy Adams) to Edward Fletcher-Wooten (Jack Davenport).  The problem is that Edward's best man is Kat's ex-boyfriend, Jeffrey (Jeremy Sheffield).  So Kat intends to make Jeffrey jealous by hiring Nick Mercer (Dermot Mulroney) to be her ""boyfriend"" for the festivities.  There is a moment early on Kat's mother, Bunny (Holland Taylor) insists on publicly savaging Kat at the welcoming functioning when Jeffrey rescues Kat from the moment and I though that maybe there was some misdirection going on here and that instead of a twist on ""Pretty Woman"" we were redoing another Julie Roberts vehicle, ""My Best Friend's Wedding.""  But that is not the case and Nick and Kat are indeed the story's focal point.  However, those cinematic comparisons help to underscore the strength and weakness of this film.The weakness is that you have to accept that Messing's Kat is so unworthy of affection that the best she can do is Jeffrey, because the more we find out about him the less we like him.  Forgetting this loser is a better move than trying to make him jealous, but the script demands that Kat have tied herself into knots over this jerk so that Nick can undo the damage.  But I really have a problem with taking good looking and intelligent actresses and turning them into saps like happens here.  I am not particularly willing to believe that Debra Messing has to pay for male companionship, but that is what you have to do here, and every time she does something that makes her seem cute or sweet it undercuts the premise of her desperation.  Plus, every time we learn more about Jeffrey we have to question Kat's intelligence.  Love might make you blind, but where is the corollary that this translates into being stupid as well?  That is why these stories tend to work better as Ugly Duckling stories (e.g., ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"") rather than as Cinderella (e.g., ""Pretty Woman"").  What is interesting here is that this movie continues to inflict a fair amount of pain on Kat, which is more typical of the former although the lead character is not.The strength of the film for me is Mulroney's Nick, both in terms of the performance and how the character is written.  This is slightly ironic because this 2005 romantic comedy is written by first time screenwriter Dana Fox from the novel by Elizabeth Young and directed by Clare Kilner (""How to Deal""), so I was rather surprised that overall I found some of the male characters to be better drawn and more sympathetic (including Kat's father, Victor, played by Peter Egan, who I remember as Oscar Wilde in the mini-series ""Lillie"").  But I end up rounding up on ""Wedding Date"" because of Mulroney.  Nick is not simply a stud for hire.  This guy knows what to do and what to say, whether it is to the woman who has hired him, her father, or the groom.  More importantly, he is not fake when he deals with this people, although he does tend to be short with Kat when she insists on coming apart at every other thing that happens.  This guy is up to his neck in this situation while also being apart from it, but he is willing to play the game at face value and not fake anything beyond pretending to be Kat's boyfriend.This gets us to the big problem of the film, because we know why she should like him, but he is so busy being ""professional"" that it is hard to believe Kat can find a real moment in their interactions to latch on to because she would have to think that was just part of the service she was paying for.  Then there is the larger question of why he should fall for her, because she is such a mess that finding the real her and bringing it up to the surface seems like too much effort, let alone waiting around for her to be someone worth loving under the convoluted circumstances of the storyline.  At that point Kat is calling on the reservoir of good well that exists towards Messing because of ""Will and Grace,"" which is also dangerous because then we think about the movie ""Picture Perfect"" with Jennifer Aniston, which then gets us back to this entire genre of romantic comedies where two people in a fake relationship end up living happily ever after.  Obviously there is a market for such stories and faulting Hollywood for being redundant and repetitive is hardly worth the effort at this point.  Deciding to check out this one is essentially going to come down to how much you like the two principles so that looking at the cover tells you everything you need to know.",4,Pretty predictable but the performances are engaging enough to compensate,1124236800,"08 17, 2005",2005,4729,"['Wedding', 'Date', 'borderline', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'working', 'terms', 'premise', 'predictability', 'premise', 'easily', 'reducible', 'what', 'glean', 'trailer', 'Kat', 'Ellis', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'England', 'wedding', 'sister', 'Amy', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Edward', 'Fletcher-Wooten', 'Jack', 'Davenport', 'problem', 'Edward', 'best', 'man', 'Kat', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Jeffrey', 'Jeremy', 'Sheffield', 'So', 'Kat', 'make', 'Jeffrey', 'jealous', 'hiring', 'Nick', 'Mercer', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'be', 'boyfriend', 'festivities', 'moment', 'early', 'Kat', 'mother', 'Bunny', 'Holland', 'Taylor', 'publicly', 'savaging', 'Kat', 'welcoming', 'functioning', 'when', 'Jeffrey', 'Kat', 'moment', 'though', 'maybe', 'was', 'misdirection', 'going', 'here', 'instead', 'twist', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'were', 'redoing', 'Julie', 'Roberts', 'vehicle', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'not', 'case', 'Nick', 'Kat', 'are', 'indeed', 'story', 'focal', 'point', 'However', 'cinematic', 'comparisons', 'help', 'underscore', 'strength', 'weakness', 'film.The', 'weakness', 'have', 'accept', 'Messing', 'Kat', 'so', 'unworthy', 'affection', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'Jeffrey', 'more', 'find', 'out', 'less', 'like', 'Forgetting', 'loser', 'better', 'move', 'trying', 'make', 'jealous', 'script', 'Kat', 'have', 'tied', 'knots', 'jerk', 'so', 'Nick', 'can', 'undo', 'damage', 'really', 'have', 'problem', 'taking', 'good', 'looking', 'intelligent', 'actresses', 'turning', 'saps', 'happens', 'here', 'am', 'not', 'particularly', 'willing', 'believe', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'pay', 'male', 'companionship', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'here', 'time', 'something', 'seem', 'cute', 'sweet', 'premise', 'desperation', 'time', 'learn', 'more', 'Jeffrey', 'have', 'question', 'Kat', 'intelligence', 'Love', 'might', 'make', 'blind', 'where', 'corollary', 'being', 'stupid', 'well', 'why', 'stories', 'tend', 'work', 'better', 'Ugly', 'Duckling', 'stories', 'e.g.', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'rather', 'Cinderella', 'e.g.', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'What', 'interesting', 'here', 'movie', 'inflict', 'fair', 'amount', 'pain', 'Kat', 'more', 'typical', 'former', 'lead', 'character', 'not.The', 'strength', 'film', 'Mulroney', 'Nick', 'terms', 'performance', 'how', 'character', 'written', 'slightly', 'ironic', '2005', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'written', 'first', 'time', 'screenwriter', 'Dana', 'Fox', 'novel', 'Elizabeth', 'Young', 'directed', 'Clare', 'Kilner', 'How', 'Deal', 'so', 'was', 'rather', 'surprised', 'overall', 'found', 'male', 'characters', 'be', 'better', 'drawn', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'including', 'Kat', 'father', 'Victor', 'played', 'Peter', 'Egan', 'who', 'remember', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'mini-series', 'Lillie', 'end', 'up', 'rounding', 'up', 'Wedding', 'Date', 'Mulroney', 'Nick', 'not', 'simply', 'stud', 'hire', 'guy', 'what', 'do', 'what', 'say', 'woman', 'who', 'hired', 'father', 'groom', 'More', 'importantly', 'not', 'fake', 'when', 'people', 'tend', 'be', 'short', 'Kat', 'when', 'coming', 'apart', 'other', 'thing', 'guy', 'up', 'neck', 'situation', 'also', 'being', 'apart', 'willing', 'play', 'game', 'face', 'value', 'not', 'fake', 'anything', 'pretending', 'be', 'Kat', 'boyfriend.This', 'big', 'problem', 'film', 'know', 'why', 'should', 'like', 'so', 'busy', 'being', 'professional', 'hard', 'believe', 'Kat', 'can', 'find', 'real', 'moment', 'interactions', 'latch', 'would', 'have', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'part', 'service', 'was', 'paying', 'Then', 'larger', 'question', 'why', 'should', 'fall', 'such', 'mess', 'finding', 'real', 'her', 'bringing', 'surface', 'too', 'much', 'effort', 'let', 'alone', 'waiting', 'be', 'someone', 'loving', 'convoluted', 'circumstances', 'storyline', 'point', 'Kat', 'calling', 'reservoir', 'good', 'well', 'towards', 'Messing', 'Will', 'Grace', 'also', 'dangerous', 'then', 'think', 'movie', 'Picture', 'Perfect', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'then', 'back', 'entire', 'genre', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'where', 'two', 'people', 'fake', 'relationship', 'end', 'up', 'living', 'happily', 'ever', 'Obviously', 'market', 'such', 'stories', 'faulting', 'Hollywood', 'being', 'redundant', 'repetitive', 'hardly', 'worth', 'effort', 'point', 'Deciding', 'check', 'out', 'one', 'essentially', 'going', 'come', 'down', 'how', 'much', 'two', 'principles', 'looking', 'cover', 'everything', 'need', 'know']",N/A

909459,A3IRZ92KTWVKCN,B0009OL7Z4,Loves Books & Movies,"[2, 2]","A single woman Kat Ellis (Debra Messing), working in New York, doesn't want to go to her sister's wedding in London dateless for everyone to see she's still unloved, having been dumped at the altar two years ago.  Her former fianc&eacute; Jeffrey will be at this wedding as Best Man and she really isn't over him.  Kat hires a male escort, Nick Mercer (Dermot Mulroney), to be her date.Debra Messing was sparkling.  Loved watching her, loved her clothes.  Mulroney was ravishing; as a mature man in his forties he has come into his own real skin.  A few reviewers here complained that he was wooden, and the first time I watched the movie I thought so, too.  But after a few times, I decided his underwrought delivery was a deliberate counterpoint to Kat's rather frenetic navet&eacute;.  It worked well to remind us he was the professional.Supporting cast was first rate. Amy Adams was better than good as the jealous little sister Amy. [Note added after the Golden Globes January 2014: If you'd like to see a talented actress handling material way beneath her caliber, look at this.]  Brit actress Sarah Parish as TJ, Kat's raunchy cousin, just about stole every scene she was in.  Jack Davenport as the English bridegroom Ed was so endearing (""Wot!?""), I completely missed how good looking he was.  Until that scene in the church--you'll see what I mean.  I thought: Crikey!  Sheffield as Jeffrey did a good job making us glad Kat hadn't married him but sort of liking him anyway.  Peter Egan as Kat's stepfather was handsome and classy.  The Brit cast and settings really added a tone.The problem was the writing.  First: Where were the scenes to support the storyline?  Suddenly, Nick and Kat were in love.  Second (SPOILER ALERT): Why was Amy afraid Ed ""would never forgive"" her for sleeping with his best friend Jeffrey, when it happened before she and Ed started dating?  He knew she was involved with someone, so it wasn't as if he thought he was marrying a virgin.  Which leads to a third one (SPOILER ALERT): I didn't like Kat's sister Amy and couldn't understand why Kat did, as the writer did almost nothing to redeem her.  It was a failure of the first order.In spite of my complaints, The Wedding Date remains one of my favorite escapes.  It has something for us.  Perhaps the thing about renting a date because you just need a guy on your arm, but discovering he can heal your heart and empower your soul?  Yes, I noticed the parallel with Pretty Woman, but Edward in that movie had colossal self esteem already.  Nick gave that to Kat.  ""Holy Crap, you're worth every penny!"" a dazed Kat says to him after he tells her to remember what a wonderful woman she is.  Men bonding with other men and actually talking about personal things to one another?  The strong supporting British cast which gave it a bright, sophisticated edge?  The gorgeous English locations right out of a Wodehouse novel?  The engaging musical score?  Just know it it's a pleasant jaunt.  The Wedding Date is a charmer for grownups.[Added later: I bought this film and have the advantage of seeing it many times.  I know people have missed important things, because I became aware of them only after watching several times.  That must be the fault of the writing.  One is that Nick confessed to Kat's stepfather, Victor, who he was. It was implied.  Nick ate the anchovies Victor offered him (he hates anchovies), and asked if he could date Victor's stepdaughter.  Some reviewers complained it was an unbelievable coincidence that Victor had read Nick's article. Not if Nick went to his room and got the article for Victor to read at that time.  The other scene I think it's a shame people overlooked was at the rehearsal dinner when Jeffrey was listening to Amy tell everybody she had stolen Kat's first boyfriend, Tony Pee-Pants.  If you get s chance to see it again, watch the look on Jeffrey's face, as he realizes he had been duped into dumping Kat for her.]",4,Flawed But Lovable,1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,3951,"['single', 'woman', 'Kat', 'Ellis', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'working', 'New', 'York', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'sister', 'wedding', 'London', 'dateless', 'everyone', 'see', 'still', 'unloved', 'having', 'been', 'dumped', 'altar', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'former', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Jeffrey', 'will', 'be', 'wedding', 'Best', 'Man', 'really', ""n't"", 'Kat', 'male', 'escort', 'Nick', 'Mercer', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'be', 'date.Debra', 'Messing', 'was', 'sparkling', 'Loved', 'watching', 'loved', 'clothes', 'Mulroney', 'was', 'ravishing', 'mature', 'man', 'forties', 'come', 'own', 'real', 'skin', 'few', 'reviewers', 'here', 'complained', 'was', 'wooden', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'movie', 'thought', 'so', 'too', 'few', 'times', 'decided', 'underwrought', 'delivery', 'was', 'deliberate', 'counterpoint', 'Kat', 'rather', 'frenetic', 'navet', 'eacute', 'worked', 'well', 'remind', 'was', 'professional.Supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'first', 'rate', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'was', 'better', 'good', 'jealous', 'little', 'sister', 'Amy', '[', 'Note', 'added', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'January', '2014', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'talented', 'actress', 'handling', 'material', 'way', 'caliber', 'look', ']', 'Brit', 'actress', 'Sarah', 'Parish', 'TJ', 'Kat', 'raunchy', 'cousin', 'just', 'stole', 'scene', 'was', 'Jack', 'Davenport', 'English', 'bridegroom', 'Ed', 'was', 'so', 'endearing', 'Wot', 'completely', 'missed', 'how', 'good', 'looking', 'was', 'scene', 'church', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'thought', 'Crikey', 'Sheffield', 'Jeffrey', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'glad', 'Kat', 'had', ""n't"", 'married', 'sort', 'liking', 'anyway', 'Peter', 'Egan', 'Kat', 'stepfather', 'was', 'handsome', 'classy', 'Brit', 'cast', 'settings', 'really', 'added', 'tone.The', 'problem', 'was', 'writing', 'First', 'Where', 'were', 'scenes', 'support', 'storyline', 'Suddenly', 'Nick', 'Kat', 'were', 'love', 'Second', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Why', 'was', 'Amy', 'afraid', 'Ed', 'would', 'never', 'forgive', 'sleeping', 'best', 'friend', 'Jeffrey', 'when', 'happened', 'Ed', 'started', 'dating', 'knew', 'was', 'involved', 'someone', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'thought', 'was', 'marrying', 'virgin', 'Which', 'third', 'one', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'did', ""n't"", 'Kat', 'sister', 'Amy', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Kat', 'did', 'writer', 'did', 'almost', 'nothing', 'redeem', 'was', 'failure', 'first', 'order.In', 'spite', 'complaints', 'Wedding', 'Date', 'one', 'favorite', 'escapes', 'something', 'Perhaps', 'thing', 'renting', 'date', 'just', 'need', 'guy', 'arm', 'discovering', 'can', 'heal', 'heart', 'empower', 'soul', 'Yes', 'noticed', 'parallel', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Edward', 'movie', 'had', 'colossal', 'esteem', 'already', 'Nick', 'gave', 'Kat', 'Holy', 'Crap', ""'re"", 'worth', 'penny', 'dazed', 'Kat', 'remember', 'what', 'wonderful', 'woman', 'Men', 'bonding', 'other', 'men', 'actually', 'talking', 'personal', 'things', 'one', 'strong', 'supporting', 'British', 'cast', 'gave', 'bright', 'sophisticated', 'edge', 'gorgeous', 'English', 'locations', 'right', 'Wodehouse', 'novel', 'engaging', 'musical', 'score', 'Just', 'know', 'pleasant', 'jaunt', 'Wedding', 'Date', 'charmer', 'grownups', '[', 'Added', 'later', 'bought', 'film', 'have', 'advantage', 'seeing', 'many', 'times', 'know', 'people', 'have', 'missed', 'important', 'things', 'became', 'aware', 'only', 'watching', 'several', 'times', 'must', 'be', 'fault', 'writing', 'One', 'Nick', 'confessed', 'Kat', 'stepfather', 'Victor', 'who', 'was', 'was', 'implied', 'Nick', 'ate', 'anchovies', 'Victor', 'offered', 'anchovies', 'asked', 'could', 'date', 'Victor', 'stepdaughter', 'reviewers', 'complained', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'coincidence', 'Victor', 'had', 'read', 'Nick', 'article', 'Not', 'Nick', 'went', 'room', 'got', 'article', 'Victor', 'read', 'time', 'other', 'scene', 'think', 'shame', 'people', 'overlooked', 'was', 'rehearsal', 'dinner', 'when', 'Jeffrey', 'was', 'listening', 'Amy', 'tell', 'everybody', 'had', 'stolen', 'Kat', 'first', 'boyfriend', 'Tony', 'Pee-Pants', 'get', 's', 'chance', 'see', 'again', 'watch', 'look', 'Jeffrey', 'face', 'had', 'been', 'duped', 'dumping', 'Kat', ']']",N/A

Certainly, the situation that Kat Ellis (Debra Messing) finds herself in - a single woman who hires a man to pose as her date for a family wedding - is loaded with comic possibilities. But the movie also recognizes Kat's pain, embarrassment and anger.It's this darker undercurrent that makes ""The Wedding Date"" more than a bubble-gum soap opera.When we first meet her, Kat seems to be wigging out over the prospect of flying to Britain for her sister's wedding. Her situation is actually worse. The sister is a self-absorbed nightmare. The best man, Jeffrey, is Kat's ex-fiance and the man who broke her heart.The last thing Kat wants to do is show up without a guy. So, she employs a male escort, Nick Mercer (Dermot Mulroney), to pretend to be her boyfriend. Kat and Nick must convince her friends and family that they are crazy in love and make Jeffrey sorry he ever left Kat.The trip is about Kat getting over her past, and Nick allowing himself to feel love. Events take an unexpected and dark twist before everything is put to rights.The big rap against Messing, star of the TV series ""Will & Grace,"" is that she plays Kat as Grace Adler without Will. We still don't know if Messing can do more than look adorable and take pratfalls.Mulroney played Julia Roberts' crush in 1997's ""My Best Friend's Wedding."" He was good-looking back then, but now he's beyond hot. Mulroney gives Nick a smoldering, sexy aloofness leavened with charm and a tendency to spout aphorisms about life and love.Messing and Mulroney are surrounded by a strong supporting cast of American and British actors.Holland Taylor plays Kat's outspoken mother, Bunny Ellis. British actress Sarah Parish is hilarious as Kat's randy and uninhibited friend, T.J. American actress Amy Adams is pitch-perfect as the spoiled sister Amy.Kilner and screenplay writer Dana Fox bring a female point of view to ""The Wedding Date."" They aren't afraid to let the darker elements overshadow the humor when the story demands it, and they really explore Kat's emotional journey.Thank goodness author Elizabeth Young's book, ""Asking for Trouble,"" on which the film is based, wasn't turned into a ""Porky's""-style sex comedy.So many romantic comedies are tired and predictable, because they are about two people who the audience knows will be together by the end. ""The Wedding Date"" starts with two people who are a couple for the wrong reasons and lets us watch them couple up for the right reasons.Pour the champagne and toast ""The Wedding Date.""",4,A hot 'Date',1107475200,"02 4, 2005",2005,2738,"['Fresh', 'point', 'view', 'puts', 'sizzle', 'story', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sappyLike', 'romance', 'real', 'world', 'Wedding', 'Date', 'part', 'laughs', 'part', 'tears.Director', 'Clare', 'Kilner', ""n't"", 'interested', 'squeezing', 'possible', 'gag', 'scene', 'Certainly', 'situation', 'Kat', 'Ellis', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'single', 'woman', 'who', 'man', 'pose', 'date', 'family', 'wedding', 'loaded', 'comic', 'possibilities', 'movie', 'also', 'Kat', 'pain', 'embarrassment', 'anger.It', 'darker', 'undercurrent', 'Wedding', 'Date', 'more', 'bubble-gum', 'soap', 'first', 'meet', 'Kat', 'be', 'wigging', 'prospect', 'flying', 'Britain', 'sister', 'wedding', 'situation', 'actually', 'worse', 'sister', 'self-absorbed', 'nightmare', 'best', 'man', 'Jeffrey', 'Kat', 'ex-fiance', 'man', 'who', 'broke', 'heart.The', 'last', 'thing', 'Kat', 'do', 'show', 'up', 'guy', 'So', 'male', 'escort', 'Nick', 'Mercer', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'pretend', 'be', 'boyfriend', 'Kat', 'Nick', 'must', 'convince', 'friends', 'family', 'are', 'crazy', 'love', 'make', 'Jeffrey', 'sorry', 'ever', 'left', 'Kat.The', 'trip', 'Kat', 'getting', 'past', 'Nick', 'allowing', 'feel', 'love', 'Events', 'take', 'unexpected', 'dark', 'twist', 'everything', 'put', 'rights.The', 'big', 'rap', 'Messing', 'star', 'TV', 'series', 'Will', 'Grace', 'Kat', 'Grace', 'Adler', 'Will', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Messing', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'look', 'adorable', 'take', 'pratfalls.Mulroney', 'played', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'crush', '1997', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'was', 'good-looking', 'back', 'then', 'now', 'hot', 'Mulroney', 'Nick', 'smoldering', 'sexy', 'aloofness', 'leavened', 'charm', 'tendency', 'spout', 'aphorisms', 'life', 'love.Messing', 'Mulroney', 'are', 'surrounded', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'American', 'British', 'actors.Holland', 'Taylor', 'Kat', 'outspoken', 'mother', 'Bunny', 'Ellis', 'British', 'actress', 'Sarah', 'Parish', 'hilarious', 'Kat', 'randy', 'uninhibited', 'friend', 'T.J.', 'American', 'actress', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'pitch-perfect', 'spoiled', 'sister', 'Amy.Kilner', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'Dana', 'Fox', 'bring', 'female', 'point', 'view', 'Wedding', 'Date', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'let', 'darker', 'humor', 'when', 'story', 'really', 'explore', 'Kat', 'emotional', 'journey.Thank', 'goodness', 'author', 'Elizabeth', 'Young', 'book', 'Asking', 'Trouble', 'film', 'based', 'was', ""n't"", 'turned', 'Porky', '-style', 'sex', 'comedy.So', 'many', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'tired', 'predictable', 'are', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'audience', 'knows', 'will', 'be', 'together', 'end', 'Wedding', 'Date', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'couple', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'watch', 'couple', 'up', 'right', 'reasons.Pour', 'champagne', 'toast', 'Wedding', 'Date']",N/A

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[46, 51]","The Wedding Date is a romantic comedy, and to do that formula well you either have to do the formula perfectly with perfectly cast leads or you have to come up with a unique angle.  The Wedding Date tries both.Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney make a good-looking couple.  All of the women in this movie and all the women at my house were swooning over Mr. Mulroney who looks like he just stepped off the cover of one of those passionate-embracing romance novels.  Ms. Messing has the looks and timing to pull off her role, which requires a decent amount of suspension of disbelief.  She comes from a well-off family, but in the opening scenes we see that she is a supervisor of working stiffs.  Her sister is getting married over in England and her ex-fiancee, who painfully dumped her a few years ago, is the best man.  She wants to impress all the right people so she hires professional escort Mr. Mulroney - for $6,000.  That is an expensive date, and I don't know any regular people who would pay anything close to that simply to impress an ex.But we swallow that and watch the film for what it is.  Debra and Dermot are likable and attractive.  Sarah Parish delivers most of the best lines in the movie as saucy cousin TJ.

Several times I started to turn off the DVD player, but I ended up toughing it out till the end.  The overall concept of the movie isn't bad (like Pretty Woman in reverse), but the way the movie is thrown together is terrible.  It's also hard to follow.  I was a pretty good way through the movie before I even realized it was taking place in England.  Kat and the escort she hires to pose as her boyfriend hate each other one minute and like each other the next.  (It takes no more than merely practicing the wedding dance to completely turn around their feelings for each other.)  Then at the end they fall in love for no apparent reason.  There is friction between Kat and her family, but we never really find out why.  Toward the end when we find out why Kat's ex-fiance dumped her, the reason is so devastating that we never recover from it.

It was enjoyable to watch, fun to see how a woman deals with a male escort since usually it's the other way around.  Kat is completely self-conscious about bringing Nick to her sister's wedding, since she's not dating him, is going to see her ex-fiance at the wedding, and for some reason her parents have decided to abandon their old rule of couples having to sleep in seperate rooms when there's no ring involved.  But Nick is, of course, an expert at this and has everybody convinced that he and Kat are in love with each other.  Messing and Mulroney are good onscreen together, the supporting cast does pretty well, though the sisters relationship kind of broke my heart through most of the movie.

What we get is a typical, formulaic romantic comedy that strains for laughter and romance. That's not to say that there weren't a few interesting/clever scenes, but this film is actually a retread of that disappointing and forgettable Julianne Moore/Pierce Brosnan romantic comedy. Setting the film in England helps a little, but not a lot. Debra Messing is a sitcom actress through and through and it shows.Here are the formulaic ingredients to a romantic comedy:1) Mix-matched pair who shouldn't be together2) quirky sidekicks that provide most of the laughs3) musical montages featuring remakes of songs we've heard a zillion times before4) a deception always drives the couple apart at the end of the second act5) the couple always ends up together and happily ever after.My favorite romantic comedies generally break out of the formula with strong chemistry between the two leads, with enough quirky diversions to make the storyline fresh, and are worth seeing again and again. ""Pretty Woman"" and ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" were those movies and classics. This one is a throw-away. Aside from a couple interesting scenes and some good choices in music, I did not find much to like about this tripe movie. Debra Messing simply wasn't convincible as an actress to pull off the already outlandish premise. She's treading into J-Lo territory...so save your date and watch something else.

909502,AMZYAGVDQWTS,B0009OL7Z4,Reviews No More,"[0, 2]","I guess I'm only repeating what a lot of other people have said about this one.  It's  Pretty Woman in reverse, featuring Debra Messing of Will and Grace and Dermot Mulroney as the male callboy she pays 6 grand to pose as her boyfriend at her dopey half-sister's wedding in Surrey.  There was just enough chemistry between the two characters to make the romance believable but not hot--at least not like Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard in the classic Breakfast at Tiffany's.  In fact, this movie will never be a classic because it's just so disposable.Dermot Mulroney is cute, but he's no gigolo and his looks are too offbeat to play a hot male stud.  Messing is pretty, but I would like to know why she looks so much better in the bonus features than she does during the entire course of the movie.  The real problem with this movie is that there isn't much of a plot to work with, and it's almost as if this was written by some frustrated single woman who is living out her romantic fantasies on film.  I write this stuff by hand in notebooks everyday and then throw it away, keeping the character names if I like them enough for other things...say this reviewer account.  This is like some of my subpar writing, so maybe I shouldn't have been so quick to throw some of my ideas out after viewing this film.All in all, despite some stereotypical British roles and some very predictable scenarios, this isn't a bad romantic flick, but I would never buy it.  Also, there is charm enough to make it engaging, but never all that interesting.

909503,A2HRVVDJMY5M4Z,B0009OL7Z4,R. Graff,"[2, 3]","I enjoy romantic comedies a lot, and rented this with high hopes.  Debra Messing hires Dermot Mulroney from an escort service as her date to her sister's wedding, and to show off how well off she is to her cynical family.  Predictably, the business relationship becomes more romantic, and the two fall in love.The premise could have worked, if it weren't for a few glaring problems.  One, you don't really feel you know the main characters at all; they are just cliched romantic comedy prototypes, meaning you never really know why the two leads fall for each other.  Two, him being an escort doesn't really add anything to the plot, even though the movie thinks it does.  Three, none of the characters come across very likeable.  Four, Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney have no chemistry at all.  You don't really care if the two get together, or even want them to, since they are rather cold to each other for most of the movie.If only one problem could be fixed, I'd choose the chemistry factor.  That could easily be fixed by replacing one of the actors.  Maybe Julia Roberts for Debra Messing, since it's fairly obvious this movie was probably proposed as a vehicle for her, or anyone else to be the Dermot Mulroney character, since he's really given nothing to do but be goodlooking.  No good romance exists without the chemistry.However, if you are looking for a simple diversion to kill 90 minutes, this movie could be okay.  If not, rent/watch Pretty Woman instead, which is more or less the same premise, but actually makes you care about the characters.",2,Disappointed....,1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,1564,"['enjoy', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'lot', 'rented', 'high', 'hopes', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'escort', 'service', 'date', 'sister', 'wedding', 'show', 'off', 'how', 'well', 'cynical', 'family', 'Predictably', 'business', 'relationship', 'more', 'romantic', 'two', 'fall', 'love.The', 'premise', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'were', ""n't"", 'few', 'glaring', 'problems', 'One', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'know', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'cliched', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'prototypes', 'meaning', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'why', 'two', 'leads', 'fall', 'other', 'Two', 'being', 'escort', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'plot', 'even', 'movie', 'Three', 'none', 'characters', 'come', 'very', 'likeable', 'Four', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'have', 'chemistry', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'two', 'get', 'together', 'even', 'want', 'are', 'rather', 'cold', 'other', 'most', 'movie.If', 'only', 'one', 'problem', 'could', 'be', 'fixed', ""'d"", 'choose', 'chemistry', 'factor', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'fixed', 'replacing', 'one', 'actors', 'Maybe', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'proposed', 'vehicle', 'anyone', 'else', 'be', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'character', 'really', 'given', 'nothing', 'do', 'be', 'goodlooking', 'good', 'romance', 'exists', 'chemistry.However', 'are', 'looking', 'simple', 'diversion', 'kill', '90', 'minutes', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'okay', 'not', 'rent/watch', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'instead', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'premise', 'actually', 'care', 'characters']",N/A

The blurb on the back cover begins describing ""this hilarious romantic comedy"".  Don't believe it.  There are a couple of chuckles strategically dispersed amidst the angst, but this story is more like one of those darker Shakespearean ""problem comedies"" where the characters end up more messed-up than they began, and there is much more pathos than humor (although I'm sure MAD magazine must have done a very funny satire). On paper, the plot promises all kinds of comic possibilities. Debra Messing knows that the old boyfriend from whom she never recovered will be at her sister's wedding back home in England, and she is so determined not to give him a psychological edge that she invents a new boyfriend, hires a male escort (Dermot Mulroney), and drags him all the way across the ocean to meet the folks.  Messing tries to use Mulroney not only to make her old boyfriend jealous, but also to insinuate himself into his confidence and function as a spy.  Between his confusing progress reports and her back-firing efforts to impress her parents and friends that Mulroney is ""the one"", Messing gets boxed into a heavier romantic entanglement than she can handle.

Seriously? That is what Hollywood liberals call writing? Imagination? And we are supposed to believe a man who sleeps with strange women for money is &#34;well read&#34; and &#34;confident&#34; and &#34;Brown educated&#34; . . . better and more together than all the other characters . . . only in Hollywood-fairy-land maybe. Also we are to believe that a CSR for Virgin Atlantic Airlines lives in the brownstone that this character lives in. Yeah right. In the real world she would live in Queens at best and have 6 room mates. Are we really supposed to root for a woman who has such little self-respect for herself and her family to invite not only a sex worker along with her but to her family's home? Are Americans asleep when they watch this stuff? Something was going on with Pretty Woman . . . Americans flocked to that similar movie in droves. . . . . Prostitutes aren't the girl next door. Sorry. And the girl next door are not prostitutes. . . well in persona not geography as I have no idea who you live next door to. Anyway this movie is sick. And the one British cousin character is just a mess and her vulgar mouth is offensive. It isn't funny. It isn't cute. It is gross. Sometimes, lately, I am embarrassed to be an American. Most countries have a movie and TV industry that represents their culture. In America it tries to form culture and most foreigners think this trash represents me. It does not. It doesn't represent anyone I know. Geez. What about the hooker with feelings when this guy &#34;falls in love&#34;. I mean have we gone from being special when we turn around the bad boy to being special because we can turn a male prostitute?!?!! Good Heavens. What he just needed to prostitute himself out until he found the &#34;right one&#34;??!! Come on. This movie is not only a joke it is just unbelievable. Why do all American movies like this have to revolve around a lie--Pretty Woman, While you were Sleeping, My Best Friend's Wedding, etc? If it isn't a lie it is some violent murder. American movies are just sad anymore. Put the Wizard back in the control room and just fake it like the 50s if you can't come up with anything better than this garbage with your &#34;freedom&#34;.The truly sad part is this movie had potential . . . why I gave it two stars and not one.

909530,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B0009OL7Z4,Terry Mesnard,"[1, 2]","You remember those coloring books you had when you were young?  The kind with the little numbers in each segment that asked you to apply red to all number 1s, blue to all number 2s, etc?  This movie is a lot like that.  I am not the prime demographic for romantic comedies.  I do enjoy them on occasion, but I will be the first to roll my eyes at flaws I find in them.  I say this not to sound arrogant or anything, but to simply put down my biases.Going back to the paint by numbers concept, there are all of the plot points (numbers) in this movie that all of the most cliched romantic movies have.  Because I'm talking about the story, I have to say there are *SPOILERS* below.  But most people will know how the movie will end...You have the character with a problem, Debra Messing's Kat.  You have her fiance that you know isn't right for her.  And finally you have her possible love interest, Dermot Mulroney's male escort Nick.  You have the moment where a misunderstanding occurs, resulting in Nick and Kat taking a break and then the final coming together, of sorts.  Most romantic comedies, even the good ones like When Harry Met Sally, follow this convention.  However, what separates the good ones from the not so good ones is this romantic movies by numbers idea.What I mean, directly, is that you have Nick and Kat who you KNOW are supposed to get together in the end.  However, there isn't a path that we actually see of them falling for each other.  There's plenty of the ""I hate you but need to do this"" attitude in the beginning.  There's the role that Nick plays, presumably to all of his clients, where he shows Kat what she is missing.  So its understandable, possibly, that Kat would fall for Nick.  But why does Nick fall for Kat?  What differentiates her from the bazillion other girls he's wooed, and taken their money?  In essense, what makes him give up his tricks and decide on Kat?  This essential step was missing from the movie.  In fact, the film makers skip this movie progression and instead just take it for granted that us, the audience, will follow them.I know its not my own biases that makes me make that comment, for I have a coworker who is madly in love with romance movies (The Notebook is, according to her, ""the best movie ever"") who felt the same way.  I felt mildly insulted that the film makers just assumed we would make the blind leap of faith that a man who just made $6,000 applying his trade would, for no apparent reason, fall for his client.  It was a similar situation in Pretty Woman.  However, in Pretty Woman it was believable.  Here, it was not.So paint by number it was.  Did I enjoy it?  Well, I laughed, chuckled and smirked (much like Dermot, who can't seem to do anything but smirk) but I was left wondering how we got to the end.  I might blindly believe some things, but the progression of this movie is not one of them.  Pretty decent on laughs, not so much on the romance, a renter in my book at the most.",3,Mediocre romantic by numbers,1124668800,"08 22, 2005",2005,2974,"['remember', 'coloring', 'books', 'had', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'kind', 'little', 'numbers', 'segment', 'asked', 'apply', 'red', 'number', '1s', 'blue', 'number', '2s', 'etc', 'movie', 'lot', 'am', 'not', 'prime', 'demographic', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'do', 'enjoy', 'occasion', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'roll', 'eyes', 'flaws', 'find', 'say', 'not', 'sound', 'arrogant', 'anything', 'simply', 'put', 'down', 'biases.Going', 'back', 'paint', 'numbers', 'concept', 'are', 'plot', 'points', 'numbers', 'movie', 'most', 'cliched', 'romantic', 'movies', 'have', ""'m"", 'talking', 'story', 'have', 'say', 'are', '*SPOILERS*', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'will', 'end', 'have', 'character', 'problem', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Kat', 'have', 'fiance', 'know', ""n't"", 'right', 'finally', 'have', 'possible', 'love', 'interest', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'male', 'escort', 'Nick', 'have', 'moment', 'where', 'misunderstanding', 'occurs', 'resulting', 'Nick', 'Kat', 'taking', 'break', 'then', 'final', 'coming', 'together', 'sorts', 'Most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'even', 'good', 'ones', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'follow', 'convention', 'However', 'what', 'good', 'ones', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'ones', 'romantic', 'movies', 'numbers', 'mean', 'directly', 'have', 'Nick', 'Kat', 'who', 'KNOW', 'are', 'supposed', 'get', 'together', 'end', 'However', ""n't"", 'path', 'actually', 'see', 'falling', 'other', 'plenty', 'hate', 'need', 'do', 'attitude', 'beginning', 'role', 'Nick', 'presumably', 'clients', 'where', 'Kat', 'what', 'missing', 'understandable', 'possibly', 'Kat', 'would', 'fall', 'Nick', 'why', 'Nick', 'fall', 'Kat', 'What', 'bazillion', 'other', 'girls', 'wooed', 'taken', 'money', 'essense', 'what', 'give', 'up', 'tricks', 'decide', 'Kat', 'essential', 'step', 'was', 'missing', 'movie', 'fact', 'film', 'makers', 'skip', 'movie', 'progression', 'instead', 'just', 'take', 'granted', 'audience', 'will', 'follow', 'them.I', 'know', 'not', 'own', 'biases', 'make', 'comment', 'have', 'coworker', 'who', 'madly', 'love', 'romance', 'movies', 'Notebook', 'according', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'who', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'felt', 'mildly', 'insulted', 'film', 'makers', 'just', 'assumed', 'would', 'make', 'blind', 'leap', 'faith', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'made', '6,000', 'applying', 'trade', 'would', 'apparent', 'reason', 'fall', 'client', 'was', 'similar', 'situation', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'However', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'was', 'believable', 'Here', 'was', 'not.So', 'paint', 'number', 'was', 'Did', 'enjoy', 'Well', 'laughed', 'chuckled', 'smirked', 'much', 'Dermot', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'do', 'anything', 'smirk', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'got', 'end', 'might', 'blindly', 'believe', 'things', 'progression', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'Pretty', 'decent', 'laughs', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'romance', 'renter', 'book', 'most']",N/A
