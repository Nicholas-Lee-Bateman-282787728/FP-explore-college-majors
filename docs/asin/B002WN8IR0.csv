1297051,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B002WN8IR0,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[2, 2]","I'm glad I bought THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW SEASON 6 DVD because I was going to stop after season 4 (especially since Rhoda left in #3). But this season keeps the laughs going! And although another regular cast member spins off to her own series and leaves the cast, Cloris Leachman as ""Phyllis Lindstrom,"" the rest of the company more than fills the void.Betty White, Gavin MacLeod, Georgia Engel, and the fantastic Ted Knight pick up the slack that Valerie Harper ""Rhoda"" and Leachman left behind. Ed Asner and Mary Tyler Moore are still great together and this ensemble cast gels quite nicely even though the show seemed to stumble in season 5.Although there aren't any special features included on the DVDs, the season is still worth buying. This season has Mary moving to a new apartment building and there are numerous guest appearances by actors who were probably just starting out like John RitterThree's Company - Season One, and Penny MarshallLaverne & Shirley - The Complete First Season, who would eventually star in their own long running sitcoms.Also look for a cameo from Valerie Harper ""Rhoda Morgenstern"" and David Groh ""Joe Gerard,"" and the then first lady, Betty Ford. Another great addition to season 6 is Mary's love interest ""Joe Warner"" played by non-other than Ted Bessell--who some of you might remember as ""Donald Hollinger"" fromThat Girl - Season One.So if you like classic television or wondered why shows like MTM have such a cult-like following, I highly recommend getting the THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW SEASON 6.",5,Moore *Laughs* With Mary And The WJM-TV Crew!,1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,1542,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'bought', 'THE', 'MARY', 'TYLER', 'MOORE', 'SHOW', 'SEASON', '6', 'DVD', 'was', 'going', 'stop', 'season', '4', 'especially', 'Rhoda', 'left', '3', 'season', 'laughs', 'going', 'regular', 'cast', 'member', 'own', 'series', 'cast', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'Phyllis', 'Lindstrom', 'rest', 'company', 'more', 'void.Betty', 'White', 'Gavin', 'MacLeod', 'Georgia', 'Engel', 'fantastic', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'pick', 'up', 'slack', 'Valerie', 'Harper', 'Rhoda', 'Leachman', 'left', 'behind', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'together', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'gels', 'quite', 'nicely', 'even', 'show', 'seemed', 'stumble', 'season', '5.Although', 'are', ""n't"", 'special', 'features', 'included', 'DVDs', 'season', 'still', 'worth', 'buying', 'season', 'Mary', 'moving', 'new', 'apartment', 'building', 'are', 'numerous', 'guest', 'appearances', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'probably', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'John', 'RitterThree', 'Company', 'Season', 'One', 'Penny', 'MarshallLaverne', 'Shirley', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'who', 'would', 'eventually', 'star', 'own', 'long', 'running', 'sitcoms.Also', 'look', 'cameo', 'Valerie', 'Harper', 'Rhoda', 'Morgenstern', 'David', 'Groh', 'Joe', 'Gerard', 'then', 'first', 'lady', 'Betty', 'Ford', 'great', 'addition', 'season', '6', 'Mary', 'love', 'interest', 'Joe', 'Warner', 'played', 'non-other', 'Ted', 'Bessell', 'who', 'might', 'remember', 'Donald', 'Hollinger', 'fromThat', 'Girl', 'Season', 'One.So', 'like', 'classic', 'television', 'wondered', 'why', 'shows', 'MTM', 'have', 'such', 'cult-like', 'following', 'highly', 'recommend', 'getting', 'THE', 'MARY', 'TYLER', 'MOORE', 'SHOW', 'SEASON', '6']",N/A
1297052,A14H1F5YCUEU4J,B002WN8IR0,Andrew Budgell,"[50, 52]","After what seemed like an eternity, fans of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" were rewarded for their patience with a terrific release of ""Season Five"" last October. (The Oprah effect, anyone?) Hot on the heels of that release comes the announcement for ""Season Six"" which contains easily the greatest episode of the series and arguably one of the greatest episodes of any sitcom ever: ""Chuckles Bites the Dust"". In previous seasons the action was split between Mary's home life and work life. However, with the departure of Rhoda and Phyllis, the show now takes place almost exclusively at WJM-TV and the comedy really matures. You don't see shows written like this anymore, so sit back and enjoy yourself with some old friends this winter.Fans can expect the following classic episodes when the set arrives in February:1. Edie Gets Married2. Mary Moves Out3. Mary's Father4. Murray In Love5. Ted's Moment of Glory6. Mary's Aunt7. Chuckles Bites the Dust8. Mary's Delinquent9. Ted's Wedding10. Lou Douses an Old Flame11.

The packaging  was the same as season 5, maybe a little better because there was actually an episode title included.

It seems that, late-1960's to mid-1970's, TV really did hit a creative peak of sorts. And in the past few years, I found it pretty cool to have seen these shows again, be reunited with them. Last spring I watched the first 3 seasons of MTM & loved them. I bought season 4 last summer , watched it & loved it, in the fall, season 5, and just a couple of weeks ago I watched season 6, loved it (ESPECIALLY THE ""CHULKES"" ONE!!!) And like most others, I gave my 5 stars based largely on the fact I loved the episodes & picture quality, and not so much because of the packaging. But this times around there's at least a list of episodes inside.

1297061,A11CUAZXSK1305,B002WN8IR0,David P. Mikelberg,"[8, 27]","I was not expecting Season 6 so soon; being truly surprised when Amazon revised this product page to reveal cover artwork and a release date.  I immediately browsed to Amazon with the intention of ordering it.  I stopped short after I got a good look at the cover artwork and seven reviews.  I thought to myself, ""Seven reviews for a product that hasn't come out yet?""  Each one is a Five Star review, no less.""  OK, I admit I was wrong.  It was only six reviews; one was a plea to add the curtain calls at the end of The Last Show.  I may not know show business but, as Mary Richards says, ""I've been...nearby.""  Maybe someone got an advance copy of the DVD set.  So, let's see what is available here.In my review of the MTM Season 5 DVD, I compared the artwork for that set to something you might see on a street corner bootleg.  This one is no better, with a pretty unflattering picture on the front.  Has anyone noticed that Ms. Moore's head is a few centimeters off her neck?  It hurts just to look at it.  And don't try it at home, kids.  I've already had to make an appointment with my chiropractor after trying to duplicate the pose.  Why is she looking up, and to what?  I have a few theories.This could be an outtake from the episode, Mary Moves Out.  In the scene right before this, Mary has just hung her letter ""M"" in her new apartment before declaring, ""I don't like it"" (Oh dear, I have actual MTM dialogue in my head.  I have watched too much television!).  Now outside the building,  Jay Sandrich, the Director suggests she look up at the apartment as if to see if she likes it any better.  The tight little smile you see was simply Ms. Moore's way to cover up the incredible pain she felt after hurting her neck and spine.  This could also be an unused picture from a Season 6 photo shoot.  Ms. Moore was instructed to look up and smile, perhaps to suggest she really did ""make it after all"".  She made it all right, but only to the nearest emergency room.  I have one more theory, this being my favorite.  In an effort by FOX to subliminally suggest that Rhoda is not gone (to her own series), they Photoshopped Mary's head on to Valerie Harper's body.  This puts up a big ""red light"" for me; the artwork, along with the suggestion that this set will be in the same kind of packaging as Season 5.  In my opinion it does not look promising.  I will wait for some real reviews before I buy this.As for the reviews themselves, have any of the reviewers actually seen the Season 6 DVDs?  There is no mention of picture quality or the presence of any extras.  There was mention that this release could be the result of the MTM cast appearing on Oprah.  I have seen first hand the results of the ""Oprah Effect"".  This isn't it!  When Oprah has an effect on something the response time is usually measured in days, not months.  I speculate that for Ms. Winfrey, they probably rebuilt the entire MTM set, allowing her to star (as Rhoda) in a remake of the episode ""Rhoda the Beautiful.""  Think about it while I take a moment to apologize to Ms. Winfrey. (Oprah, Rhoda the Beautiful was the first episode I thought of that would mirror your own life.  It is certainly the episode that I most relate to.  It has its poignancy, though. Don't you think so?  And we'd have to wait for 2011 for you to appear in a remake of The Last Show.)I'm not trying to put anyone down here.  Those of us waiting for these releases have done so for the last three years.  That's plenty of time to write reviews containing every known fact about the MTM Show.  Some of us may even know the inside story of Hazel Frederick's life.  After having seen the Season 5 set and the cover of Season 6, I believe that the MTM Show is in the hands of a company that doesn't give a rat's patootie about how its released. Unfortunately, this is the case for many past home video releases of the MTM Show.  That's too bad.On the right side of my computer screen there is a sidebar in which Amazon has suggestions for what makes a good review.  In it there is a question asking what I want to know prior to purchasing this product.  Amazon's Review Guidelines state that a review ""should focus on specific features of a product"".  Thus far, every review here refers to the content and NOT the product.  Before I purchase anything, I want to know about the product itself.  I do not need to be pre-sold on the content.  I think we all know how remarkable the content is.  I've lost count of how many times I have seen every episode of MTM.  It remains as funny and fresh as the first time I saw it.  In many cases I can actually quote it.  I've got Cloris Leachman's monologue from The Lars Affair playing in my head right now.  ""You know, just the other day I was reading this wonderful book called, The Life of The Bee.  Perhaps you've read it.""  Perhaps FOX Home Video could ""assume"" the role of the ""male bee"" from that monologue.Some might suggest I am being nit-picky and pedantic.  I won't be surprised if I find a Peter Peanut costume left on my doorstep, along with a ticket to a circus parade. I might be 100% wrong.  The releases of The MTM Show Seasons 6 and 7 may very well be something to look forward to.  I tend to doubt it.  Additionally, I hope that in the future Amazon will follow its own guidelines and wait, posting reviews of actual products.UPDATE - February 18, 2010It's released, and thankfully the episodes look and sound great.  There are no extras here, which may be a good thing.  There have been two reunion specials, an episode of Biography, the two documentaries featured with the Seasons 1 & 2 sets, a book and Oprah.  There may not be any more we could learn about the MTM show.  Some of this is available for viewing on You Tube, along with an ending many are clamoring for.  Maybe we'll get extras galore when and if FOX releases the ""Complete Series"" box.Thanks to a reviewer from another site, I learned that the flimsy case is now the little Fox-ies default packaging for it's DVD product.  I guess its something we will have to get used to.Perhaps the most important element here is the condition of the episodes and once again, they look and sound great.

1297068,AUS44O1LQILQD,B002WN8IR0,"Italo ""italoman9""","[1, 1]","Watching MTM's Season 6 reminded me how always-happy-perky Mary Richard's iconic TV character image wasn't always.  And I figured out why.  TMTMS wasn't rerun into perpetuity after it left the air in 1977, like some shows.  And when it did get picked up in syndication, for some reason a lot of stations didn't stick with it for its entire 7-year run.  So what happened is that later generations got to see usually only the first few seasons with Rhoda, Phyllis, Mary's first apartment, and Mary with all her over-the-top hairstyles and fashions.  But this release, and the show's coincidental longrun repeats on MeTV, have reminded me of how in later seasons--including episodes I literally hadn't really seen in decades--Mary really matured, and how great this show was at developing its characters and giving them backstories.Season Six Mary begins to reflect real-life working women and has a job wardrobe that becomes a bit more realistically modest; she re-wears the same outfits in some episodes.  Heck, even her hair stays more the same, and she finally tones down some of the earlier seasons' stage makeup and ditches the bigtime false eyelashes.  We see a Mary who shows more of her not-always-positive or upbeat sides, and I mean that in a complimentary way.  Younger generations will enjoy seeing that Mary Richards could have doubts, get irritated, want to make changes in her personal, romantic and domestic life, to debate, to answer back, and not simply exist in the workplace--or the world--to be a ""pretty woman.""  Rather, as the '70s grew, so did Mary Richards.  She showed, especially in this and the seventh season of TMTMS, that women could rightfully be in the workplace and be themselves, and earn their places there, without always needing to have every beautiful hair and matching dress accessory in place, or smiling a megawatt smile and holding her disagreeing feelings inside in order to make her male coworkers or her supervisors happy.  In this later phase, I'm glad that Mary Richards showed that she actually did, for real, make it after all.  :)",5,Mary Grows Up,1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,2079,"['Watching', 'MTM', 'Season', '6', 'reminded', 'how', 'always-happy-perky', 'Mary', 'Richard', 'iconic', 'TV', 'character', 'image', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'figured', 'out', 'why', 'TMTMS', 'was', ""n't"", 'rerun', 'perpetuity', 'left', 'air', '1977', 'shows', 'when', 'did', 'get', 'picked', 'up', 'syndication', 'reason', 'lot', 'stations', 'did', ""n't"", 'stick', 'entire', '7-year', 'run', 'So', 'what', 'happened', 'later', 'generations', 'got', 'see', 'usually', 'only', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'Rhoda', 'Phyllis', 'Mary', 'first', 'apartment', 'Mary', 'over-the-top', 'hairstyles', 'fashions', 'release', 'show', 'coincidental', 'longrun', 'repeats', 'MeTV', 'have', 'reminded', 'how', 'later', 'seasons', 'including', 'episodes', 'literally', 'had', ""n't"", 'really', 'seen', 'decades', 'Mary', 'really', 'matured', 'how', 'great', 'show', 'was', 'developing', 'characters', 'giving', 'backstories.Season', 'Six', 'Mary', 'reflect', 'real-life', 'working', 'women', 'job', 'wardrobe', 'bit', 'more', 'realistically', 'modest', 'same', 'outfits', 'episodes', 'Heck', 'even', 'hair', 'more', 'same', 'finally', 'tones', 'down', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'stage', 'makeup', 'bigtime', 'false', 'eyelashes', 'see', 'Mary', 'who', 'more', 'not-always-positive', 'upbeat', 'sides', 'mean', 'complimentary', 'way', 'Younger', 'generations', 'will', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'Mary', 'Richards', 'could', 'have', 'doubts', 'get', 'irritated', 'want', 'make', 'changes', 'personal', 'romantic', 'domestic', 'life', 'debate', 'answer', 'back', 'not', 'simply', 'exist', 'workplace', 'world', 'be', 'pretty', 'woman', 'Rather', ""'70s"", 'grew', 'so', 'did', 'Mary', 'Richards', 'showed', 'especially', 'seventh', 'season', 'TMTMS', 'women', 'could', 'rightfully', 'be', 'workplace', 'be', 'earn', 'places', 'there', 'always', 'needing', 'have', 'beautiful', 'hair', 'matching', 'dress', 'accessory', 'place', 'smiling', 'megawatt', 'smile', 'holding', 'disagreeing', 'feelings', 'order', 'make', 'male', 'coworkers', 'supervisors', 'happy', 'later', 'phase', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Mary', 'Richards', 'showed', 'actually', 'did', 'real', 'make']",N/A

She also moves into a new apartment after Phyllis leaving the show as well.  The first few episodes seem to struggle a little as Mary tries one new hairdo after another, but gains stride and offers some great episodes during the course of the season.  The focus is on Mary and Lou, where it should be, although Ted and Sue Ann get plenty of space, with a very funny episode in which Murray accepts the job of producing Sue Ann's show, only to find out why so many producers have left her before.The biggest change is in Ted's life as he finally decides to tie the knot with Georgette, who has become Mary's best friend, with a hilarious wedding scene that included young John Ritter as a novice priest.  Ted and Georgette also adopt a young son (Robbie Rist) at season's end.Penny Marshall also features into two or three episodes, one as Lou's date, as he tries to regain a former girlfriend, who appears with Jeff Conaway (of Taxi fame) on her arm at a party he contrived at Mary's flat to see her again.The best episodes, however, are those in which Mary's aunt pays a couple visits.  Eileen Heckart is wonderful as Flo Meredith, who shakes up the newsroom with her indomitable personality.

As to the box, it came in, I could care less.  Only cared about the show.  Season 6 was much better than season 5.  Especially the 2nd disk.  I didn't care much for Season 5, but I thought Season 6, particularly disks 2&3 were much better than season 5, which I didn't care much about.  I especially liked giving the Happy Homemaker, Sue Ann many more scenes and Ted, less.  She's so much better and funnier than he was.  His comedy is his stupidity his arrogance, and his ever loving bragging about his money in front of those who make much less than he did. He could be funny sometimes, but most of the time, he just turned me off.  Just didn't like him.Anyway, in Season 6, Mary get's romantic, falls in love... finally ... and also Dan appears again, so Mary has 2 boyfriends.  Mary get's a new apartment and she also talks to Rhoda long distance.  So that was good. Mary and Phillis are still missed, and Georgette or Sue Ann cannot take their place. IN fact, Georgette has always got on my nerves.  Still, I liked the sixth season much better than the fifth. Although the first disk of 6 was just average, imo.Season five was mis-titled the MTM Show, when it should have been titled the Ted Baxter show.  Like candy, TB is good in small packages as he was in the earliest years.  But when he takes over every single scene, he's obnoxious and boring.I was disappointed in Season 5, and I hoped 6 would be better. It was, but, I doubt anything can beat 1-4.  Without Rhoda, Phillis, and Mary together, much is lost. I really didn't like the story about Lou & Edie's divorce and characters in 4. It also broke up the pace of the show and I thought that was a spoiler.  The part about her going back to school and Lou's problem with it, was funny, but I thought the divorce was not in Lou or Edie's character.  It did, however set the scene for 5's adventure with Lou and his new girlfriend. That didn't work either. Didn't make sense. Lou was way too conservative to have been involved with a show girl. Heaven's! Everybody was teasing him for just dating Rhoda a few times.Finally in Season 6 everybody's waiting for the demise of Chuckles the Clown, whom I think we only saw personally in one scene and that was WJM's election results during a snow storm.  I saw the show about Chuckles getting killed in a parade years ago, and never thought there was anything that funny about it.  It was silly, but not really funny.  In fact, I barely remembered it.  I couldn't figure out why that particular show was rated #1 when there were so many better ones.  But, since it's been years since I had seen the last 3 seasons, I hoped they were good.Saw Chuckles again in Disk 1 of Season Six and didn't think it was any better than the first time I saw it years ago.  Don't know what all the fuss was about.But still, liked most of Season 6, and glad I ordered it.  Happy to note there was less of Ted and he didn't act quite as absurd and obnoxious as he did in Seasons 1-5.",4,Season 6,1263168000,"01 11, 2010",2010,3103,"['hoped', 'Season', '6', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'Season', '5', 'IT', 'WAS', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'anyone', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'can', 'write', 'review', 'box', 'came', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'Only', 'cared', 'show', 'Season', '6', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'season', '5', 'Especially', '2nd', 'disk', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'Season', '5', 'thought', 'Season', '6', 'particularly', '2', '3', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'season', '5', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'especially', 'liked', 'giving', 'Happy', 'Homemaker', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'many', 'more', 'scenes', 'Ted', 'less', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'funnier', 'was', 'comedy', 'stupidity', 'arrogance', 'ever', 'loving', 'bragging', 'money', 'front', 'who', 'make', 'much', 'less', 'did', 'could', 'be', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'most', 'time', 'just', 'turned', 'off', 'Just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'him.Anyway', 'Season', '6', 'Mary', 'get', 'romantic', 'love', 'finally', 'also', 'Dan', 'again', 'so', 'Mary', '2', 'boyfriends', 'Mary', 'get', 'new', 'apartment', 'also', 'Rhoda', 'long', 'distance', 'was', 'good', 'Mary', 'Phillis', 'are', 'still', 'missed', 'Georgette', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'IN', 'fact', 'Georgette', 'always', 'got', 'nerves', 'Still', 'liked', 'sixth', 'season', 'much', 'better', 'fifth', 'first', 'disk', '6', 'was', 'just', 'average', 'imo.Season', 'five', 'was', 'mis-titled', 'MTM', 'Show', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'titled', 'Ted', 'Baxter', 'show', 'candy', 'TB', 'good', 'small', 'packages', 'was', 'earliest', 'years', 'when', 'single', 'scene', 'obnoxious', 'boring.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Season', '5', 'hoped', '6', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'was', 'doubt', 'anything', 'can', 'beat', '1-4', 'Rhoda', 'Phillis', 'Mary', 'together', 'much', 'lost', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'story', 'Lou', 'Edie', 'divorce', 'characters', '4', 'also', 'broke', 'up', 'pace', 'show', 'thought', 'was', 'spoiler', 'part', 'going', 'back', 'school', 'Lou', 'problem', 'was', 'funny', 'thought', 'divorce', 'was', 'not', 'Lou', 'Edie', 'character', 'did', 'however', 'set', 'scene', '5', 'adventure', 'Lou', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'either', 'Did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Lou', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'conservative', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'show', 'girl', 'Heaven', 'Everybody', 'was', 'teasing', 'just', 'dating', 'Rhoda', 'few', 'times.Finally', 'Season', '6', 'everybody', 'waiting', 'demise', 'Chuckles', 'Clown', 'whom', 'think', 'only', 'saw', 'personally', 'one', 'scene', 'was', 'WJM', 'election', 'results', 'snow', 'storm', 'saw', 'show', 'Chuckles', 'getting', 'killed', 'parade', 'years', 'ago', 'never', 'thought', 'was', 'anything', 'was', 'silly', 'not', 'really', 'funny', 'fact', 'barely', 'remembered', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'particular', 'show', 'was', 'rated', '1', 'when', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'better', 'ones', 'been', 'years', 'had', 'seen', 'last', '3', 'seasons', 'hoped', 'were', 'good.Saw', 'Chuckles', 'again', 'Disk', '1', 'Season', 'Six', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'better', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'years', 'ago', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about.But', 'still', 'liked', 'most', 'Season', '6', 'glad', 'ordered', 'Happy', 'note', 'was', 'less', 'Ted', 'did', ""n't"", 'act', 'quite', 'absurd', 'obnoxious', 'did', 'Seasons', '1-5']",N/A

1297086,A3BZSYJKZCRY03,B002WN8IR0,Retro Pixie,"[2, 2]","I begin my review of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" season six DVD with a salute or credo to clown as Chuckles puts it:  ""A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down your pants.""  Ahh...words to live by.  Or in Chuckles' case, die by.  This season gives us plenty of chuckles and more.The 1975/76 season is known for the episode ""Chuckles Bites the Dust,"" where the infamous Chuckles the Clown (a clown with a show on WJM) dies a funny and bizarre death.  It is the ultimate in comedy acting, writing and directing.  MTM is other-worldly fantastic as Mary reacts at Chuckles' funeral.  There are many other funny moments here from other cast members, too.  Murray becomes extremely irreverent.  Also, Chuckles' death prompts Sue Ann to determine that she wants to be cremated and have her ashes thrown on Robert Redford.  If this were the only great show in this season, it would be reason enough to get it.  However, other moments and episodes are standouts as well.In ""Ted and Georgette Get Married,"" Mary has a brunch that turns into a funny wedding.  A very young John Ritter (with nice legs, by the way) appears as a minister in a tennis outfit.  The charming Ted Bessell appears as Mary's boyfriend in ""Mary Richards Falls in Love.""  Coincidentally, he played another career girl's boyfriend for five years.  Which girl was that?  Oh, right...""That Girl.""  ""The Seminar"" has Mary & Lou on a trip in D.C. where then First Lady Betty Ford makes a hilarious appearance and Dabney Coleman shows up as a congressman.  ""Once I Had a Secret Love"" has Lou telling Mary a salacious secret she can't seem to keep.  And ""Sue Ann Falls in Love"" is another good one with the gang going to the TEDDY's (television editor awards) once again; these shows are always hilarious.This season is characterized by changes, some that have been mentioned above.  Phyllis has gone to her own show.  Mary moves into another apartment, which I consider one of the very few mistakes this series ever made.  Viewers identified her original place with comfort, and it held memories & a certain charm.  Lou's ex-wife Edie gets married, which is a sentimental show that will actually leave a smile on your face at the end with the gang from WJM at a bar.  And sound the scary music...Mary has a new hairstyle, which she quickly starts to change since viewers were up in arms about it.  None of it, though, affected the quality of this outstanding show.This set has 24 episodes with good color and quality. No extras.  The packaging is the same as season five, but the episodes are listed this time.Run, don't walk, to get this great season.

One of those few comedy series where everything jelled from the writing to the acting, Mary Richards and her cohorts have a special place in the hearts of millions. In the show's sixth year, highly regarded by most fans and critics alike as being the show's best season, the episode called ""Chuckles Bites The Dust"" originally aired. TV Guide in 1997 named this episode as the best ever in the history of broadcasting. Regarded for its black comedy revolving around death, Mary is upset by her staff members for laughing at the way Chuckles died (he was crushed by an elephant while dressed as a peanut). Once at the funeral Mary becomes the one who can't control her laughter. This particular episode swept the 1975 Emmys giving awards to Mary Tyler Moore as Best Actress in a sitcom, to David Lloyd for writing the script, and the series won its second Emmy in a row as Best Comedy. Another memorable episode this year is entitled ""The Seminar"" where Mary accompanies Lou to Washington to meet some powerful people he knew from his newspaper days. None other than then First Lady Betty Ford appears as herself. 24 episodes are included in this DVD set like other seasons. Although ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" dropped in the weekly Nielsens during the 1975-1976 TV season (the show finished at #19), the series without a doubt was at its zenith.

Remove the security sheet to see it.The 5 star rating is for the content.  I would give FOX no stars for the packaging.Is it just me or did MTM age significantly between season 5 and season 6?

This Season includes some of the most Highly rated Episodes of all time in the list of TVs Top 100. Each Show transferred to DVD still looks Crystal Clear. The Packaging just doesn't do Justice to this wonderful Series, it looks cheap and has no descriptions of the Episodes and of course no Extras, but I'm glad I got the DVDs.
