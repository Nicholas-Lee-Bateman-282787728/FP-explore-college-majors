The only (slight) drawback is it is not remastered, but given the shoddy history of past releases, this is a minor point.  Nothing in the world like Gold...",5,YESSSSS!!!!,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,266,"['Yep', 'Gold', 'fans', 'one', 'buy', 'Widescreen', 'great', 'sound', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'not', 'had', 'other', 'releases', 'only', 'slight', 'drawback', 'not', 'remastered', 'given', 'shoddy', 'history', 'past', 'releases', 'minor', 'point', 'Nothing', 'world', 'Gold']",Gold
1460956,A3VPQLKGJO22OQ,B005HF4WMU,"Grrrr ""GWR""","[0, 0]","Sometimes we tend to romanticize our memories of a film we saw a long time ago. I saw GOLD when it originally came out,  and thought it was really good. The movie has been on my ""want list"" for a long long time, and I was never able to get a copy until just recently. Finally this copy came out, in widescreen, which is essential for the film, and I was...a bit let down. The main plot, dealing with problems with the gold mine and a plot to sabotage it so that some ""fat cat"" rich guys can get even richer, makes for a suspenseful story. The problem is that there is a subplot involving an affair between mine manager Roger Moore and the mine owners daughter, Susannah York , which slows the film down every time it comes to that. The annoying ""love scenes"" between the two are really boring and very 1970-ish, and they keep popping up, at least 3 times during the movie.For me, the most interesting and likeable character in the film is one of the miners, ""Big King"", as played by South African (?) actor Simon Sabela. There should have been more about him in the movie. Susannah York's character is a total bore, and has wayyyy too much screen time.  What can I recommend about this film? There's some good action scenes and a superb score by Elmer Bernstein. Otherwise, I instead recommend reading the original novel by Wilbur Smith.",2,Not as good as I remember it.,1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,1337,"['Sometimes', 'tend', 'romanticize', 'memories', 'film', 'saw', 'long', 'time', 'saw', 'GOLD', 'when', 'originally', 'came', 'out', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'been', 'want', 'list', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'get', 'copy', 'just', 'recently', 'Finally', 'copy', 'came', 'out', 'widescreen', 'essential', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'main', 'plot', 'dealing', 'problems', 'gold', 'mine', 'plot', 'sabotage', 'so', 'fat', 'cat', 'rich', 'guys', 'can', 'get', 'even', 'richer', 'suspenseful', 'story', 'problem', 'subplot', 'involving', 'affair', 'mine', 'manager', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'mine', 'owners', 'daughter', 'Susannah', 'York', 'film', 'down', 'time', 'annoying', 'love', 'scenes', 'two', 'are', 'really', 'boring', 'very', '1970-ish', 'keep', 'popping', 'up', 'least', '3', 'times', 'movie.For', 'most', 'interesting', 'likeable', 'character', 'film', 'one', 'miners', 'Big', 'King', 'played', 'South', 'African', 'actor', 'Simon', 'Sabela', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'movie', 'Susannah', 'York', 'character', 'total', 'bore', 'wayyyy', 'too', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'What', 'can', 'recommend', 'film', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'superb', 'score', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'Otherwise', 'instead', 'recommend', 'reading', 'original', 'novel', 'Wilbur', 'Smith']",Gold
