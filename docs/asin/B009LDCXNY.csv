I have never enjoyed a show more as i have this one. I love the humor in these stories, Dean is just so funny. Sam on the more serious side until he becomes evil, then he's somewhat funny. but i miss Bobby, Bobby kept these boys inline! i wish you would bring him back. Then there is the second Meg(Rachael Miner) who i absolutely love in this show love her one liners she is so funny.And then there is Castiel who i just adore. not so much on the evil side but he's very funny at times too. the cast is just a wonderful blend of real talent it's very refreshing. I wish Geniveve would come back her and her husband worked so well together on the show, very professional. wtg guys!!! best of luck to the show and writers and all cast and crew you're very entertaining and very very talented to say the least. thank you thank you for a wonderful show...keep it coming please.I do love this show, it's very entertaining, but really, why all the ruff swearing in the show? and why does every show out there have to show being gay is ok? IT IS NOT OK!! read the Holy Bible in leviticus it tells you how God actually feels about this.

1598151,A2GLQE3IMC39JF,B009LDCXNY,Amy Donnelly,"[0, 0]","First of all I am happy they have increased the episodes that Misha (castiel) is involved in. Am I the only person who thinks that Cas added alot to the series when he was introduced! He became like both a naive young brother and knowledgable older brother to both winchesters, and has become more one of the winchester family than 'the angel'. This allows him to be involved in stories beyond the angel/deomen storyline.That is the first downside i have to this series. there is very little of the old interaction between castiel and the brothers. they got to a very relaxed place at one point and now they are almost behaving like they did in series four. with the loss of Bobby you would have thought that the directors would have used him more.My biggest problem with this series though is Benny. He is a good actor, but come on! a friendly vampire! isn't that a bit overdone at this point. Supernatural has always done inventive (if strange) stories, which have helped it stay on so long. But now it is reduced to a friendly vampire!Leave it alone please!!!!I thought that this show at least would chart its own course and not fall in with the fads that everyone else is following.I understand that at the end of the day the show needs to evolve and introduce new characters into its world, after all how many times can we watch Sam and dean argue with each other! But The show needs to stick the character of Benny in the bin, stop killing off (or reducing the time of) every single well loved character on the show, and then it might get back to its best.I still enjoy Supernatural and will continue watching it as long as they keep the standards as high as they are now. This series is well worth watching.

Benny is on the track of vengeance and is hunting his maker when he takes on too many other vampires in a fight. He calls Dean for aid and assistance and as Dean is both loyal to Benny and things are still tense between Sam and Dean, he goes to Benny's assistance giving Sam the minimum of explanation.What follows is a story of cunning, revenge, love and loss with very little redemption - and it is an excellent story indeed. I am so impressed with the new season of Supernatural. I read recently that the creators are hoping to tell their story over ten seasons and if the show continues at this new level of quality I will be watching with renewed passion.

Benny, a character from purgatory (vamp) adds alot to the interesting story line although the later episodes in season 8 start to get cheesier just as most seasons of this series have done. I love the classic rock intro on alot of the episodes and the comedy aspect is great, but the series has a habit of going off-topic for 2-3 episodes each season and then picking up the main story..........which is boring alot of times. I got the season pass so the some of the later episodes getting cheesy was dissapointing after the great start.

This will not be long. I went into the ratings.  It showed that season 7 was bad. Really bad. They were not sure about season 8.  This was no surprise to me and i wrote as much. They fell victim to the same fate that House fell to. The writers of  House decided to get rid of most of the cast and wondered why the ratings took a dive and never came back. But loyal fans like me stayed with it until the very end.  Supernatural is a miracle in itself that it has made it this long. Most shows don't make it past one season.  Take ""Monday Mornings""?  I love this show. It's new. 11 episodes and they pulled the plug on it.  So we should all be grateful that Supernatural is still on. But they realized that you cant take away most of the characters that the fans love just cause you want to play an experiment in your writing. So in season 8 they brought back Bobby a little, and Castiel.  That was a start.  It was revealed in an article that many of the subjects in season 8 are all an arc to go through season 10 then end.  But season 8,they kept a close eye on and it started off well, dipped down, and they thought about pulling the plug.  The numbers went up enough anyway , just around the time some of our other favorite characters came back.  So they kept it on. I did enjoy the season although not even close to its best.  I do wish they would go back to having the brothers being really close the way they use to. they got rid of the other characters we loved because they said they wanted to get back to the feeling of Sam and Dean against the world.  But then they don't seem to write them where the two characters are comfortable with each other.  To me, it just did not feel the same or as good.  Just my opinion.

The first half was a continuation of season 7, which I found slow paced and somewhat tedious at times. I'll be honest, I never connected at all with the characters of Benny or Amelia. I appreciate what Benny did by getting Dean out of purgatory, and then Sam, but he just didn't have any strong storylines or any real reason to be here, other than to give Sam and Dean something else to bicker about. And as for Amelia, the only reason she was there was to give Sam someone to mope to about his life. Plus, I lost a LOT of respect for Amelia when she found out her husband was still alive, and she STILL sleeps with Sam after learning that. What a slut! Nothing against the actors who played those characters, but I just think there was no reason to see them as much as we did if they weren't going to do more for the story. So I didn't shed a tear when Benny went back to purgatory, or when Amelia faded away.Then, in the second half of the season, the boys finally got down to business. I really enjoyed the three trials, it was awesome to finally SEE a hellhound, and I think that the 'Men of Letters' was a great new addition to the show. I think their 'Batcave' headquarters is a great idea. It gives them a home, finally, after years of cheap hotel rooms. The closest thing the boys had to a home in the past was Bobby's house, which was burned down. I'm looking forward to having them explore around their new headquarters a lot more in season 9. We've only seen a little bit of the place; there are plenty more rooms for the boys to discover. They haven't even figured out where the electricity is coming from yet.As for how the season ended, I thought it was very good; I really like the addition of Abaddon, and it's very interesting that all the angels got kicked out of Heaven. Will this be enough to bring God into the picture? I have a little bit of reservation at Dean not allowing Sam to sacrifice himself to close the gates of Hell forever. It seems like the boys would have been prepared to make that sacrifice. Also, Castiel is powerless again? Didn't we do this before in Season 5? I'll go on record now as saying I wouldn't be surprised at all to see the reappearance of Michael, Lucifer, or both, seeing as how they are two of the most powerful characters in the Supernatural universe. Crowley may have been content to let Lucifer stay in his cage, but Abaddon, being a knight of Hell, handpicked by Lucifer, may not go along with this.

Sam and Dean and their relationship is, of course, still the focus of the show and how can you not love Castiel, the fallen-unfallen-fallen-bad guy-wannabeGod-crazy-good guy angel.  I think Castiel is one of the best characters ever created in sci-fi/fantasy tv.  Of course, I could be biased there.  Just a little.I might have found the finale a tiny bit underwhelming, if not for the conclusion of the Scribe of God/Castiel plotline...and all of the potential this creates for the next season.  Watching those final moments of the last episode really got me right back into why I started watching ""Supernatural"" in the first place--the ability to awe based on emotional investment in the lives of Sam and Dean and Castiel and on the huge world-changing events that they end up embroiled in.  Heaven.  Hell.  Purgatory.  Earth.  I never knew at the end of the season where they stopped the End of the World where this show would go, and they keep on (generally) delivering...SPOILERS:I found some of the plot lines of Season 8 a bit boring, in particular how many flashback scenes we were subjected to re Sam and his girlfriend when he quit hunting after Dean was blasted into Purgatory.  I did like how he decided, much as Dean did, that the ""normal"" life was not for him in the end.  This was a nice bookend to Dean's similar realization, but I think they just dwelled on it a bit too much.In the first watching, I didn't like the friendship Dean had with Benny, the vampire he met in Purgatory and brought back with him, and the troubles it caused with Sam.  But upon a second watching, I realized that I liked Benny more than I had at first and that this friendship shows that, more than anything, Dean's experiences in Purgatory changed him, especially considering how he had reacted previously to Sam's friendship with a ""monster.""Kevin is still a hoot and I enjoy seeing Garth, not a perfect replacement for Bobby by any means, but also an interesting character in his own right.  Plus, of course, seeing Charlie again is always wonderful; what a charming female addition to the show and I hope she appears in the next season, as well.Then we get into the meat of the show, with the Quest to close the gates of hell and the introduction of the Men of Letters...this kind of brings things full circle as we realize that the specialness of the Winchesters didn't just come down the bloodline of their mother, a Campbell, but from the Winchesters, as well.  I'm not yet sure what I think of their discovery of their own version of a ""bat-cave"" secret hideout, but I think that this show definitely needs some kind of Quest in each season...something that has been missing on occasion.This season may not have been perfect and certainly didn't high the high-high points like the Lucifer-Michael End of the World storyline...but this show is still good, still going, and I still like it.  Lots.

1598227,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B009LDCXNY,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 1]","The great advantage of having one season in DVD format is that we can in two or three days have a complete vision of the whole season. Then we can look at the architecture of the twenty-three episodes as a whole and not a brochette of tit bits.But at the same time the unity of the season is not always really complete. The producers keep some episodes that have nothing to do with the main central theme and are nothing but entertainment, some kind of recreational play time, probably to just satisfy the part of the audience who want isolated episodes and some esoteric monsters that are existing just by themselves. Djinns for example. These episodes for me are disturbing because they do not follow the main line and they scatter our attention, even if the producers are going to tell me that it corresponds to the way the very much younger generation navigates on modern tablets, 3G or even 4G cell phones, not to speak of the Internet by itself.The second remark I&#8217;ll make concerns the sexual level of the series. They must be bothered somewhere with the great success of &#8220;wincest&#8221; among the fans. In this series there is a short lesbian kissing scene and there is an ambiguous relation between a male witch and his male cat familiar that could be gay,  but the witch in the end kills his familiar and his problem was the fact that another male witch was chosen by a female dog familiar. The first witch wanted that familiar. So he created havoc for the other happy witch. Not very gay indeed. Apart from that the series was very careful to avoid any ambiguous or simply slightly undressed scene and Sam at the beginning has been living with a woman for several months and that woman will come back a couple of times in the series.So I guess the rivalry between the two brothers and their constant falling back into their mutual arms for a hug is nothing but good old manly love, generally called brotherly love. That must disappoint the &#8220;wincest-uous&#8221; fans. Too bad, though this sudden rather prude approach is for me something treacherous about the two characters. The love of these two brothers is becoming more and more hostile. That common idea that I hate you because I love you too much, and wincest come back: they become hostile out of the frustration in which the producers keep them by preventing them from satisfying their gay desires. In other words they suffer from forced closet-reclusion. I guess the Winchester brothers should go to court for their liberation.The main line revolves around two divine tablets, a demon tablet that we had already heard about and an angel tablet that is new. We come back to the prophet who is able to read and translate these tablets because he has direct knowledge of the language of God. Castiel is definitely maimed and he is wavering between one clan or the other in heaven, not to speak of his allegiance or loyalty to the Winchester brothers. These tablets are of course the objects of fights between the demons headed by the King of Hell, Crowley, the angels, or the various factions of angels, the main one being led by a woman Naomi who is a real monster in her own understanding of pure evil in the name of eternal angelic good. She is typical of these people who are eternal. They do not consider the life of mortal people is in any way respectable. Killing for them is the same thing, even many less painful than for us, as urinating against a church or a school.The stake is that these tablets enable a chosen one to close all gates to Hell for the demon tablet, and all gates to Heaven for the angel tablet. But a marginal character is introduced, the scribe of God, the one who took all the thinking and decisions of God in writ on all those tablets I guess, or on celestial books probably made of cloud mist, and he probably wrote with a mini-flash of lightning. In that line the producers even bring on the side an episode with Zeus and I don&#8217;t know what other Olympian beings and quarrels. That scribe Metatron is disturbed in his Indian reservation of the Two Rivers Tribe by Sam and Dean and he decides to get out of his reclusion and to seize power in Heaven in order to get rid of all angels and make them come down, or simply cast them down, to earth. He is the most vicious person you can imagine and he manages to succeed, and he does not forget to deprive Castiel of his angelic &#8220;soul&#8221; or essence before sending him back to earth.On the other hand the brothers have tried to close the gates to Hell and they have three tasks to perform in order to do it. Kill a hound a hell. Easy. Save an innocent man from Hell and let him go to Heaven. Slightly more difficult but they get Bobby out and up. In fact Sam fulfills the two tasks. The third one is to cure a demon. They decide to capture Crowley and to clean him up into salvation or repentance or liberation. Sam is on the point of fulfilling the last task, when Dean arrives and prevents the very last gesture because he was told by some &#8220;authority,&#8221; the disrespectable Naomi who held it from the torturing debriefing she submitted the scribe to, that it would mean the death of the one who would succeed, in the tradition of the good old Christian sacrifice.And at this moment the angels start falling from Heaven, i.e. the sky. And that is the end of the season. Frustrating, a lot, much, galore. That&#8217;s what I call a douche bag of an ending. In another direction it is a very suspenseful ending.The last element to tell about this season is the introduction of an older generation on the Winchester side: the great grandfather of the boys. He was not a hunter. He was a Man of Letters, meaning a member of a secret society that fought against evil forces by first collecting information and then getting rid of those they encountered. Anne Rice had used that kind of device in her vampire novels and her secret society went back to very old historical times and the Celts are part of these historical times because they knew how to write, just like all Germanic tribes. Sam and Dean thus manage to meet their great grandfather who gets entangled in the 1950s in some time travelling and erupts in their motel room. But this encounter is essential because they can recuperate the key to the secret haven or coven of the Men of Letters in the USA and it becomes their new back base. It is entirely demon protected and they even have an inner demon-proof panic room. But the season is now finished and we regret the episodes that brought nothing on the main story line because the season could have progressed faster. We&#8217;ll wait anyway, knowing that the ninth season must be greatly deadly and supernatural because 9 is the hour of the death of Jesus and it is also the number of many devilish forces, if not 999 or 666 (an upside down 999, and vice versa) and then it is the Beast in the Apocalypse, at least the Christian one.But it is fun in many ways, even if the speculation on these tablets is presented as if it were archaeology in the bonuses. But well, why not, since the Book of Mormon is based on such discs in some divine language that the prophet Smith was able to read and translate though he did not have any kind of high school level in education. That&#8217;s what is good about prophets. They know without learning. I guess many people would like to be prophets in their most horrible subjects, be they math, physics, chemistry, foreign languages, history or even &#8220;farniente.&#8221;Dr Jacques

1598228,A2L64BVSRA9O4Z,B009LDCXNY,Janalyn Robnett,"[0, 0]","Over the course of this series, it seems the writers incorporate conflict between the brothers simply for conflict's sake and it's as irritating as hell. For Sam to simply 'give up' on looking for Dean who accidentally ended up in Purgatory after killing the head leviathan), not even trying to find him, is simply unbelievable to me. However, that is the only thing I have against this season. (BTW, did we ever get a reason Sam left his girlfriend to end up at the cabin where Dean was hiding out after emerging from Purgatory? Did I miss something, or did the writers? Did he know Dean would be there, if so, how?) Anyway, the conflict between the brothers needs to end. it's been done to death, now they need to start building trust with each other, they need to start being the bantering brothers which is cool and comfortable, and Sam needs to lighten up a little, while at the same time Dean needs to (and is finally doing, I might add) realize his brother is growing up. The last few eps I've seen on Amazon Instant Video have and are building on this season's arc, and I'm very satisfied that the brothers are shaping up and finally becoming brothers... at the soul, not just by blood. The jury is out on what will happen in season 9, I'm watching closely, but from a distance. I've had the rug ripped out from under me a time or two as a result of curves being thrown at us from the writers and then not so unexpected curves, as though they take one step forward with Sam and then decide the conflict should take center stage and place him five steps back. Been there, done that, let's move on. Season 8 seems to be delivering here, but as I said above, I'm going to keep it at arm's length. I'm tired of being jerked around.  All i can say is, now that Sam has made his decision to stay with Dean, rather than pursue a 'normal' life, there's still traces of his longing for a normal life in the last two eps (18 and 19). Once again, he's falling back into an old and worn out routine. Enough. However, that being said, the fact that Sam is ailing from the completion of trials is enough to put Dean in protective mode and that is fine by me. it's great to see Dean wanting to look out for his younger brother with more feeling than I've felt in a long time. I just wish the writers would bring Sam full circle and quit having him be so indecisive. I don't know why they insist on playing the 'Sam wants a normal life' card throughout this series. If he really wanted that, he'd take off and get away from the hunting and fight to keep it that way. I'm sure there can be other conflicts within him that can be focused on. By doing this same old-same old routine, it proves the writers are lacking in vision or are not connected like they should be with Sam or Dean, for that matter, because Dean is always left being hurt by Sam's indecision. Ok, sorry for the rant, but there you are. I'm liking the last few eps, though. It's promising.

In the first years you have the monster of the week where Sam and Dean go find a monster figure out what it is and after almost losing a fight kill it.  In the middle years like from 3 to 5 the show got a little difficult by really screwing with its take on Christianity.  Still well written and very believable.  Years 6 and 7 not so much.  The show had lost its identity and the writers seemed to be scrambling for content,  Well in year  8 I thin k we have the best so far.  We are back to the monster of the week which I really enjoy and a subplot that spans the entire year without infringing to much on the weekly story.

He keeps the episodes fresh, contemporary and makes the soundtrack as influential as a main character... perhaps best described as simply adding ""character.""

1598295,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B009LDCXNY,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[0, 3]","Season 8 was a pretty weak season for Supernatural. The thing that keeps this show going are the main actors, and not because they are great actors but because they are good looking guys. I'm not sure which guy is which, but the actor who plays Sam is the better looking of the two guys. The actor who is Dean is just an average looking guy. I think at the end of the day though it is the coolness of these guys on camera and of course the dark story lines. That said the writing was pretty bad this season. I don't even follow this ""Men of Letters"" subplot. It does nothing for me. And the Sam character just won't stop talking about wanting to split up with his brother to live a simple conservative life, and one without hunting things. The Dean character believes he can have no real life, and he doesn't feel he can go on without his brother. For more seasons than I can remember now it has been Dean pulling Sam along, keeping him from quitting the life of hunting demons, monsters, vampires, ghouls, etc. There is supposed this rich story line of the struggle of Sam and Dean to stay together, to love each other as brothers, to keep the family together. The problem is that that story line has been so overused to where it is nauseating. I mentally zone out when Dean has one of his heart to heart talks with Sam. It's just more of the same.  And as for writing, the writers are jumping to the chase. In the first episode of 8 Dean was abruptly out of purgatory. The other story of the Dick character and the ""big mouths"" from last season was over so quick to where I kept wondering why it wasn't continuing. The thing is Sam and Dean offed Dick so fast in the last episode of season 7 to where I barely realized that whole story line had concluded.This season we saw Dean rescue a ghostly version of Bobby Springer from Hell. Yes, Dean came through a back door in Hell and found Bobby in like five minutes, and then they were out of Hell and Bobby made it back to heaven. Stuff happens so fast because so much is glossed over. I realize it would cost a lot of money and it would be complicated to have an extended stay in Hell but the pop in to Hell was a bit of a joke. The pop out of purgatory was also a bit of a joke. And of course a whole year had passed and the viewer doesn't feel a bit of that time. That time passage wasn't believable at all. When Dean went to hell the first time it was fairly believable, but the writers just didn't do anything with their story this time.I watch Supernatural because the characters are cool and handsome. Part of me wants to be one of these guys. Part of me wants to live vicariously through these characters. And who doesn't love the gothic stuff that makes Supernatural what it is? The writers and actors go through the motions almost predicting in many stories that they will suddenly not be on the air anymore. The viewers are loyal to the show. The network is behind the show because the fans love it. Too bad the writers can't develop better stories now.I'll tune in and I'll continue to buy the show as long as it is on the air though. Killing off the Bobby character was also a big mistake.",3,This show seems to want to cancel itself.,1383091200,"10 30, 2013",2013,3152,"['Season', '8', 'was', 'pretty', 'weak', 'season', 'Supernatural', 'thing', 'show', 'going', 'are', 'main', 'actors', 'not', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'looking', 'guys', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'guy', 'actor', 'who', 'Sam', 'better', 'looking', 'two', 'guys', 'actor', 'who', 'Dean', 'just', 'average', 'looking', 'guy', 'think', 'end', 'day', 'coolness', 'guys', 'camera', 'course', 'dark', 'story', 'lines', 'said', 'writing', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'follow', 'Men', 'Letters', 'subplot', 'nothing', 'Sam', 'character', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'talking', 'wanting', 'split', 'up', 'brother', 'live', 'simple', 'conservative', 'life', 'one', 'hunting', 'things', 'Dean', 'character', 'can', 'have', 'real', 'life', ""n't"", 'feel', 'can', 'go', 'brother', 'more', 'seasons', 'can', 'remember', 'now', 'been', 'Dean', 'pulling', 'Sam', 'along', 'keeping', 'quitting', 'life', 'hunting', 'demons', 'monsters', 'vampires', 'ghouls', 'etc', 'supposed', 'rich', 'story', 'line', 'struggle', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'stay', 'together', 'love', 'other', 'brothers', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'problem', 'story', 'line', 'been', 'so', 'overused', 'where', 'nauseating', 'mentally', 'zone', 'out', 'when', 'Dean', 'one', 'heart', 'heart', 'talks', 'Sam', 'just', 'more', 'same', 'writing', 'writers', 'are', 'jumping', 'chase', 'first', 'episode', '8', 'Dean', 'was', 'abruptly', 'purgatory', 'other', 'story', 'Dick', 'character', 'big', 'mouths', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'so', 'quick', 'where', 'kept', 'wondering', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'continuing', 'thing', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'offed', 'Dick', 'so', 'fast', 'last', 'episode', 'season', '7', 'where', 'barely', 'realized', 'whole', 'story', 'line', 'had', 'concluded.This', 'season', 'saw', 'Dean', 'rescue', 'ghostly', 'version', 'Bobby', 'Springer', 'Hell', 'Yes', 'Dean', 'came', 'back', 'door', 'Hell', 'found', 'Bobby', 'five', 'minutes', 'then', 'were', 'Hell', 'Bobby', 'made', 'back', 'heaven', 'Stuff', 'so', 'fast', 'so', 'much', 'glossed', 'realize', 'would', 'cost', 'lot', 'money', 'would', 'be', 'complicated', 'have', 'extended', 'stay', 'Hell', 'pop', 'Hell', 'was', 'bit', 'joke', 'pop', 'purgatory', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'joke', 'course', 'whole', 'year', 'had', 'passed', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'feel', 'bit', 'time', 'time', 'passage', 'was', ""n't"", 'believable', 'When', 'Dean', 'went', 'hell', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'fairly', 'believable', 'writers', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'story', 'time.I', 'watch', 'Supernatural', 'characters', 'are', 'cool', 'handsome', 'Part', 'be', 'one', 'guys', 'Part', 'live', 'vicariously', 'characters', 'who', ""n't"", 'love', 'gothic', 'stuff', 'Supernatural', 'what', 'writers', 'actors', 'go', 'motions', 'almost', 'predicting', 'many', 'stories', 'will', 'suddenly', 'not', 'be', 'air', 'anymore', 'viewers', 'are', 'loyal', 'show', 'network', 'show', 'fans', 'love', 'Too', 'bad', 'writers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'develop', 'better', 'stories', 'now.I', ""'ll"", 'tune', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'buy', 'show', 'as', 'long', 'air', 'Killing', 'off', 'Bobby', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'big', 'mistake']",Supernatural: S8 (DVD)

The loss of Bobby during season seven, the introduction of the tablet with the word of God that could permanently close the gates to Hell. In the eighth season opener Dean returns from Purgatory with the help of a vampire named Benny who has changed his ways. Unfortunately Cass ended up in Purgatory as well and doesn't return with Dean.Dean returns and finds that Sam has moved on with his life abandoning hunting. Dean convinces Sam to help him find a way to obtain the word of God, Kevin and close the gates to Hell forever. There is a price for everything in ""Supernatural"" and its quite steep for everyone involved including Cass who returns whole on the surface but is clearly very damaged beneath the surface.END OF SPOILERS:As with the previous seasons Warner gives us a top notch transfer with lossless audio. The exception is, of course, ""Bitten"" the found footage episode that received a mixed reaction from fans (I kind of like it for a change of pace)as it was shot on consumer grade digital video cameras but, hey, it's supposed to look that way).We get sound tracks in Portuguese and subtitles in English, Spanish and French.What's missing? Prior seasons included a booklet that gave you the title of each episode and credits. The booklet has been discontinued. I kind of miss that.The special features are quite nice for this season. We get three audio commentaries on key episodes ""Hunteri Heroici"", ""As Time Goes By"" and ""Everybody Hates Hitler"".We get a featurette on the creation of the ""found footage"" episode. ""For the Defense of Mankind"" focuses on the tablet. ""Angel Warrior: The Story of Castiel"" is a terrific featurette focusing on the character and actor Misha Collins who defined the role and made it difficult for everyone else to play an angel because, well, they pale in comparison.We get fourteen deleted scenes from the season. We also get the usual (and fun)gag reel.Ultraviolet access is provided to watch these episodes on your PC.Season eight of ""Supernatural"" demonstrated that a change in producers helped revitalized the series. While there were a couple of minor stumbles along the way, season eight is very entertaining and largely consistent.Highly recommended.",5,"""Thank you Mr. Peanut!""-Dean to the ""right hand of (the god) Plutus",1378857600,"09 11, 2013",2013,2775,"['Yes', 'quip', 'Dean', 'best', 'series', 'filled', 'clever', 'quips', 'performances.I', 'was', 'afraid', 'Supernatural', 'might', 'be', 'exorcised', 'rather', 'anemic', 'showing', 'season', 'six', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'was', 'facing', 'other', 'genre', 'shows', 'same', 'time', 'other', 'networks', 'series', 'be', 'little', 'engine', 'could', '.Season', 'seven', 'took', 'strong', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'change', 'leadership', 'new', 'interesting', 'characters.SPOILERS', 'Season', 'seven', 'ended', 'Dean', 'being', 'sent', 'Purgatory', 'leader', 'Leviathans', 'loss', 'Bobby', 'season', 'seven', 'introduction', 'tablet', 'word', 'God', 'could', 'permanently', 'close', 'gates', 'Hell', 'eighth', 'season', 'opener', 'Dean', 'returns', 'Purgatory', 'help', 'vampire', 'named', 'Benny', 'who', 'changed', 'ways', 'Unfortunately', 'Cass', 'ended', 'up', 'Purgatory', 'as', 'well', ""n't"", 'return', 'Dean.Dean', 'returns', 'Sam', 'moved', 'life', 'abandoning', 'hunting', 'Dean', 'convinces', 'Sam', 'help', 'find', 'way', 'obtain', 'word', 'God', 'Kevin', 'close', 'gates', 'Hell', 'forever', 'price', 'everything', 'Supernatural', 'quite', 'steep', 'everyone', 'involved', 'including', 'Cass', 'who', 'whole', 'surface', 'clearly', 'very', 'damaged', 'surface.END', 'SPOILERS', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Warner', 'top', 'notch', 'transfer', 'lossless', 'audio', 'exception', 'course', 'Bitten', 'found', 'footage', 'episode', 'received', 'mixed', 'reaction', 'fans', 'kind', 'change', 'pace', 'was', 'shot', 'consumer', 'grade', 'digital', 'video', 'cameras', 'hey', 'supposed', 'look', 'way', 'get', 'sound', 'tracks', 'Portuguese', 'subtitles', 'English', 'Spanish', 'French.What', 'missing', 'Prior', 'seasons', 'included', 'booklet', 'gave', 'title', 'episode', 'credits', 'booklet', 'been', 'discontinued', 'kind', 'miss', 'that.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'quite', 'nice', 'season', 'get', 'three', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'key', 'episodes', 'Hunteri', 'Heroici', 'Time', 'Goes', 'Everybody', 'Hitler', '.We', 'get', 'featurette', 'creation', 'found', 'footage', 'episode', 'Defense', 'Mankind', 'tablet', 'Angel', 'Warrior', 'Story', 'Castiel', 'terrific', 'featurette', 'focusing', 'character', 'actor', 'Misha', 'Collins', 'who', 'defined', 'role', 'made', 'difficult', 'everyone', 'else', 'play', 'angel', 'well', 'pale', 'comparison.We', 'get', 'fourteen', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'season', 'also', 'get', 'usual', 'fun', 'gag', 'reel.Ultraviolet', 'access', 'provided', 'watch', 'episodes', 'PC.Season', 'eight', 'Supernatural', 'demonstrated', 'change', 'producers', 'helped', 'revitalized', 'series', 'were', 'couple', 'minor', 'stumbles', 'way', 'season', 'eight', 'very', 'entertaining', 'largely', 'consistent.Highly', 'recommended']",Supernatural: S8 (DVD)

Now that they have been doing this show, neither of them express that view anymore. Even Mark Shepard (Satan on this show and Jacob on LOST) believed in Christ.

The story is kinda believeable to where this is what may have happened and the way it could have turned out if we lived in parallel universe. There is a spiritual feeling to the story line later on in the show that gives you a believeable feeling like this could have happened or might happen. The actors do a great job in portraying their parts.
