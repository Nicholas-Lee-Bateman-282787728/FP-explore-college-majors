It seems to me Dexter would like to have a friend in crime and allow his partner in crime to experience Dexter's killing rituals and stick to Dexter's killer codes.

Michael C Hall did it once again.Season 4 is way better and a hint....he will try to bond with another partner in crime AGAIN. I hope it doesn't end like Miguel Prado..lolololol.

1149059,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B0015ABRE2,B. Martin,"[0, 0]","The third season of Showtime's hit series about a serial killer trying to lead a ""normal"" life is a bit weaker than season 2, which was in turn a bit weaker than season 1.  Still, Dexter remains one of the most consistently excellent and original series on television and this latest installment is no exception.Season 3 finds Dexter pondering the notion of whether or not it is possible for him to have a true friend--somebody who sees him for who he truly is and even shares his dark desires.  That role is filled by Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits in a superb performance), an ambitious and charismatic assistant district attorney who uncovers Dexter's secret during the investigation into his brother's murder.  Prado is frustrated with a justice system that allows too many criminals to walk free and he is intrigued by Dexter's brand of justice.  The two men enter into a friendship/partnership of sorts despite Dexter's concerns of a butterfly effect.  He fears that he may be creating a monster of his own much in the same way that his foster father molded him, but his desire to feel normal and have someone in his life who truly understands and accepts him wins out.There are, indeed massive repercussions from this alliance.  Dexter puts himself in a position where his secret can be revealed.  Prado attempts to ruin Deborah's career in an attempt to gain leverage.  An innocent life is lost and the emotional impact of this event is devastating to Laguerta who is still reeling from the deat of Sgt. Dokes last season.  Yes, everyone has choices to make and the effects of these choices can be far reaching indeed.  This point is also illustrated in some of this season's other subplots including Deb's relationship with a CI and her partner's hassles with internal affairs.  Every action, no matter how seemingly insignificant can have far reaching impacts.  This does not bode well for Dexter's future which has seemed destined for a bad end since the beginning of this series.Overall, season 3 is a satisfiying viewing experience.  The performances by everyone are excellent.  Hall, as usual is superb in the title role, but Smits is a brilliant casting decision.  He is extremely likeable and persuasive as the A.D.A. with a passion for justice, but when his dark side emerges he transforms into a violent, angry and very dangerous creature and Smits nails every nuance of the performance.  I could have done without the subplots about Camella's bout with cancer and the mercifully brief plot regarding Masuka's attempt to be taken seriously, but those misteps aside, season three is dead on as usual.",4,The Butterfly Effect,1293148800,"12 24, 2010",2010,2612,"['third', 'season', 'Showtime', 'hit', 'series', 'serial', 'killer', 'trying', 'lead', 'normal', 'life', 'bit', 'weaker', 'season', '2', 'was', 'turn', 'bit', 'weaker', 'season', '1', 'Still', 'Dexter', 'one', 'most', 'consistently', 'excellent', 'original', 'series', 'television', 'latest', 'installment', 'exception.Season', '3', 'finds', 'Dexter', 'pondering', 'notion', 'not', 'possible', 'have', 'true', 'friend', 'somebody', 'who', 'who', 'truly', 'even', 'shares', 'dark', 'desires', 'role', 'filled', 'Miguel', 'Prado', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'superb', 'performance', 'ambitious', 'charismatic', 'assistant', 'district', 'attorney', 'who', 'Dexter', 'secret', 'investigation', 'brother', 'murder', 'Prado', 'frustrated', 'justice', 'system', 'too', 'many', 'criminals', 'walk', 'free', 'intrigued', 'Dexter', 'brand', 'justice', 'two', 'men', 'enter', 'friendship/partnership', 'sorts', 'Dexter', 'concerns', 'butterfly', 'effect', 'may', 'be', 'creating', 'monster', 'own', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'foster', 'father', 'molded', 'desire', 'feel', 'normal', 'have', 'someone', 'life', 'who', 'understands', 'wins', 'are', 'indeed', 'massive', 'repercussions', 'alliance', 'Dexter', 'position', 'where', 'secret', 'can', 'be', 'revealed', 'Prado', 'ruin', 'Deborah', 'career', 'attempt', 'gain', 'leverage', 'innocent', 'life', 'lost', 'emotional', 'impact', 'event', 'devastating', 'Laguerta', 'who', 'still', 'reeling', 'deat', 'Sgt', 'Dokes', 'last', 'season', 'Yes', 'everyone', 'choices', 'make', 'effects', 'choices', 'can', 'be', 'far', 'reaching', 'indeed', 'point', 'also', 'illustrated', 'season', 'other', 'subplots', 'including', 'Deb', 'relationship', 'CI', 'partner', 'hassles', 'internal', 'affairs', 'action', 'matter', 'how', 'seemingly', 'insignificant', 'can', 'have', 'far', 'reaching', 'impacts', 'not', 'bode', 'well', 'Dexter', 'future', 'seemed', 'destined', 'bad', 'end', 'beginning', 'series.Overall', 'season', '3', 'satisfiying', 'viewing', 'experience', 'performances', 'everyone', 'are', 'excellent', 'Hall', 'usual', 'superb', 'title', 'role', 'Smits', 'brilliant', 'casting', 'decision', 'extremely', 'likeable', 'persuasive', 'A.D.A', 'passion', 'justice', 'when', 'dark', 'side', 'violent', 'angry', 'very', 'dangerous', 'creature', 'Smits', 'nails', 'nuance', 'performance', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'subplots', 'Camella', 'bout', 'cancer', 'mercifully', 'brief', 'plot', 'regarding', 'Masuka', 'attempt', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'misteps', 'aside', 'season', 'three', 'dead', 'usual']",Dexter: Season 3

1149062,AKV4KNED39L68,B0015ABRE2,"Bradley P. Valentine ""Ears picking up the sla...","[9, 16]","Dexter is one of the best shows on TV, and one of the few I would admit to watching on a regular basic, frankly.  For me, it's all about Michael C. Hall.  Or mostly about him.  The side players have strengthened from season 1 to season 2, as did all elements of the show.  But going to season 3, it's hard to wonder if the creative team wasn't a bit burnt out and dry for ideas.  Don't misunderstand.  It's still a good show and certainly worth your time if you are a Dexter fan.  However, I felt like the writers and actors struggled to give the characters things to do to justify their presence this year as well as falling a little flat for me giving Dexter a moral dilemma about friendship and connection that I felt like was already covered excellently in season 2.  That being said, Jimmy Smits does a good job, providing some of the seasons most memorable scenes, such as his incognito disguise in one of the later episodes and his ""COUNT ON IT!"" outburst on a Miami rooftop.  Another complaint.  The showrunners like to talk about Dexter as being a character who the audience likes but who eventually repels the audience when his Dark Passenger reveals itself.  I disagree.  I don't get this sense at all.  Dexter the killer feels more and more like Dexter the superhero to me, defending truth and justice and the American way, haha.  Yeah, something isn't right here.  For a character who likes to believe he has no conscience, why does the show increasingly motivate his character by giving him one?  Of all the far fetched plots on the show, I think the rehabilitation of a serial killer as we're watching as the series goes on (his lesser evil murders to protect his family and sister, etc) is perhaps the least believable.I hope season 4 delves into deeper moral conflict.  Like what if the Dark Passenger begins feeling compelled to go after Dexter's own family?  In other words, I'm hoping the show goes back to mining its dark premise for what it's worth.  What a rare opportunity to do so.",3,"Review is for season 3 only, not the DVD or the other seasons",1241654400,"05 7, 2009",2009,2006,"['Dexter', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'TV', 'one', 'few', 'would', 'admit', 'watching', 'regular', 'basic', 'frankly', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'mostly', 'side', 'players', 'have', 'strengthened', 'season', '1', 'season', '2', 'did', 'elements', 'show', 'going', 'season', '3', 'hard', 'wonder', 'creative', 'team', 'was', ""n't"", 'bit', 'burnt', 'dry', 'ideas', 'Do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'still', 'good', 'show', 'certainly', 'time', 'are', 'Dexter', 'fan', 'However', 'felt', 'writers', 'actors', 'struggled', 'give', 'characters', 'things', 'do', 'justify', 'presence', 'year', 'as', 'well', 'falling', 'little', 'flat', 'giving', 'Dexter', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'friendship', 'connection', 'felt', 'was', 'already', 'covered', 'excellently', 'season', '2', 'being', 'said', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'good', 'job', 'providing', 'seasons', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'such', 'incognito', 'disguise', 'one', 'later', 'episodes', 'COUNT', 'ON', 'IT', 'outburst', 'Miami', 'rooftop', 'complaint', 'showrunners', 'talk', 'about', 'Dexter', 'being', 'character', 'who', 'audience', 'likes', 'who', 'eventually', 'audience', 'when', 'Dark', 'Passenger', 'disagree', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'Dexter', 'killer', 'more', 'more', 'Dexter', 'superhero', 'defending', 'truth', 'justice', 'American', 'way', 'haha', 'Yeah', 'something', ""n't"", 'right', 'here', 'character', 'who', 'believe', 'conscience', 'why', 'show', 'increasingly', 'motivate', 'character', 'giving', 'one', 'far', 'fetched', 'plots', 'show', 'think', 'rehabilitation', 'serial', 'killer', ""'re"", 'watching', 'series', 'lesser', 'evil', 'murders', 'protect', 'family', 'sister', 'etc', 'perhaps', 'least', 'believable.I', 'hope', 'season', '4', 'delves', 'deeper', 'moral', 'conflict', 'what', 'Dark', 'Passenger', 'feeling', 'compelled', 'go', 'Dexter', 'own', 'family', 'other', 'words', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'show', 'back', 'mining', 'dark', 'premise', 'what', 'worth', 'What', 'rare', 'opportunity', 'do', 'so']",Dexter: Season 3
1149063,A1M181I8IYDLDA,B0015ABRE2,Brandon Cozart,"[0, 0]","The lovable serial killer is back for his third go-round in Dexter: The Third Season. After the rather shocking conclusion to season two, Dexter (Michael C. Hall) gets somewhat of a fresh start since the only people who knew about his dark secret are, shall we say, no longer with us. The season starts out with a bang -- Dexter kills someone accidentally without properly vetting him according to the code.This first victim is revealed to be the brother of Assistant District Attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits), which turns the Miami police department into a circus as the prominent Prado family demands answers and retribution. Prado's involvement in the investigation leads to an unlikely friendship between him and Dexter, a friendship which bucks against all of Dexter's instincts and the lessons he learned from his father. As the season plays out, Dexter must decide whether he can successfully become a normal member of human society -- one with friends, meaningful relationships, even children -- or whether he should largely remain a recluse for fear of being found out for what he truly is.The success or failure of this season lies in whether or not the viewer likes the character of Miguel Prado. I honestly did not care for the entire arc involving him, so this season is the weakest of the three seasons that have aired, in my opinion. However, that's not to say that if you do not like Prado, then the season is not worth watching. There are many reasons that Dexter is one of the best shows on television, and one of those reasons is that even if there is a weak point in a season, there is plenty more intrigue to keep one's interest.As has been the case in the first two seasons, we learn a lot more about Dexter's deceased father, Harry (James Remar). Dexter starts to see that Harry might not have been the hero on a pedestal that Dexter has for so long believed him to be. Because of this, Dexter questions many of his father's teachings, seeking to adapt the ""Code of Harry"" more to his liking, especially in trying to make a friend in Miguel Prado. Even if one does not like Prado's character, watching the existential struggles that Dexter goes through in light of his relationship with Prado makes the season well worth watching.Further complicating things for the Dark Defender is his relationship with Rita (Julie Benz). Early on, Dexter finds out that he is going to be a father. This revelation really messes with Dexter's head as he wrestles with unending thoughts of how he would be as a father, how he could raise a child who never knew about the dark secret, and, worst of all, wondering if the child will turn out to be like him. This season boasts the greatest amount of character development, thus far, in Rita as she becomes a much stronger person and more mature as a character and a fixture in Dexter's life.The rest of the cast conducts business as usual, providing their own plot twists, such as Laguerta's (Lauren V&eacute;lez) previous relationship with the Prados, and comic relief. And then there's Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), Dexter's sister, whom the writers never really seem to know what to do with, other than involving her with guys she shouldn't be with.All things considered, this season of Dexter is definitely worth catching, though it's the weakest of the three existing seasons. Even so, Dexter is still more intelligent and refreshing than 99% of the drivel that ends up on television.Video/AudioLike previous seasons, this Blu-ray set is presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio in 1080p with bright and vibrant colors and an excellent picture quality. The audio, presented in 5.1 Dolby TrueHD, is also quite clear and sharp.Special FeaturesAlso like previous Blu-ray versions of the Dexter series, this set is dreadfully devoid of special features.  In fact, no special features exist on the discs themselves (not even episode commentaries). The special features that the set boasts can only be accessed through BD-Live and include excerpts from the novel Dexter by Design, interviews with series stars Michael C.

First of all, the main concept of the season is too reminiscent of Season 2: Dexter finds a kindred spririt. Except that this time, the confidant is a guy instead of a sexy girl. This raises the question: is Dexter a moron? Why does he bond with this guy after the betrayal of his trust last season? The writers also seem to have lost sight of the character's essential strangeness: Dexter seems to be a serial killer the way some people are stamp collectors. Despite some lip service to his ""dark passenger"", we see a guy in a pretty normal relationship (the weirdness of Rita in Season 1 is totally over), showing little sign of pathology other than some killing to ""take out the trash"". The clever conceits of Season 2 (Dex as superhero? Dex as subject of an investigation?) are not matched here (the hazy ""investigation"" of Quinn is pure filler); there's very little to distract from the tedious friendship storyline. Other minuses: Deb's new haircut is awful, it's still a mystery why she is considered a competent cop, and Jimmy Smits as Miguel Prado is convincing as a small-time politician (chummy, phony, pushy) but not particularly interesting as a character (impenetrable without being intriguing).

Most viewers identified the series by Nate, the reluctant funeral director brother who was straight and sexually charismatic.  Right now it is almost hard for me to remember Peter Krause, who played Nate, but Michael C. Hall has another top series, DEXTER.  This time around the viewer cannot fail to notice him as top banana because DEXTER is wholly dominated by Dexter/Hall.  I have read all of the DEXTER books and then later listened to them in audio and, finally, have watched all three seasons of the show.  I obviously love all incarnations of DEXTER.  In a nutshell, Dexter is a serial killer but with a difference.  Dexter is a forensic investigator in the Miami police department.  His sister is a cop with the homicide division.  She is Dexter's only surviving family member.  Dexter serial kills the bad guys in Miami.  He doesn't serial kill anyone who is a good guy. He was taught this unique serial killer path by his now dead father, Harry, who was a cop.  Harry was taken with the idea of putting away bad guys who had escaped the legal system and when he discovered his son was a psychopath (in the torturing animals phase of his childhood), Harry found his perfect tool of vigilante justice. There is one big difference between DEXTER the novels and DEXTER the tv series. Although the first tv season of DEXTER stayed somewhat close to the novel version, by seasons two and three, the series took major departures from the novels.  I think the reason this was done is that the novels are considerably darker and more violent than the tv series.  Dexter is also more obviously a psychopath in the novels.  He seems to waffle on being a psychopath in the tv series, that he may indeed have some doubt about the things he does.  He has no doubts in the novels.  So he is more of a good guy in the series than he is in the books.  It doesn't matter.  The tv series totally works and actually I am enjoying that I am getting different stories in the tv series than I am getting in the novels. The tv series could not exist without Hall.  If he quit, the series would be over.  The fourth DEXTER novel is coming out next month and I can hardly wait just like I can hardly wait for season four of the DEXTER tv series.",5,Michael C.

The colors are deeply saturated in some scenes, not in others, and the effect directorially heightens the drama, as does the score. One detail I admire most in the first two episodes is that when the characters are out of doors in the Miami heat and humidity, especially Dexter, they are sweaty and their clothing is soaked in sweat.Much of this detail is lost in season three. It's as though the company came together to start shooting but the writers couldn't figure out how to keep things going and they fell back on standard TV plot lines. It's a shame. Of course, it's still worth watching, because the cast ensemble is brilliant, with the exception of the awful female defense attorney. Special kudos to Jimmy Smits for what is the performance of his career to date. However, in his final key scenes with Michael C.

1149081,A3HCCW3SPK41VG,B0015ABRE2,Darius Williamson,"[19, 21]","For two seasons, serial killer protagonist Dexter outwitted and outmaneuvered his way through any obstacle, preventing him from quenching his ingrained bloodlust. Numerous flashbacks told the story of how Dexter's cravings came alive, as well as his unique brand of vigilantism: capturing and slaying other murderers.  Predictably, having such a dangerous double life forces Dexter to lie about his entire life, despite his difficulties in masking his lack of emotions and oddball behavior towards loved ones (which includes sister Deb and girlfriend Rita).Season one nicely established that foundation, and season two expanded the concept to lofty highs.  The possibilities for season three seemed endless, and I couldn't wait to see where Dexter would go next.  Instead, it shows that Dexter's novel premise might be just that: a novelty.Season three's premise follows yet another chain of events that spurred from Dexter's late night executions.  This time, it involves the death of a district attorney's younger brother, who Dexter stabbed by accident.  The morning after, Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits), the aforementioned DA, heads over to Miami PD to be more deeply involved in the investigation, and winds up befriending Dexter because of their likeminded interests.Admittedly, the initial plot promises the same thrills Dexter is known for, and even introduces another prolific serial killer called the Skinner some episodes later.  Alas, what follows feels all too pedestrian, and it reduces Dexter into the lesser realms of procedural crime dramas.Much of that can be attributed to Dexter's more normalized problems.  Without spoiling a small surprise by the first episode's end, it forces Dexter to re-evaluate his relationship with Rita.  Problem is, compared to Dexter's previous stressors with the Ice Truck Killer and Bay Harbor Butcher cases, his recent problems aren't nearly as compelling.Another issue is the lack of continuity between seasons two and three.  Besides a brief callout of the Bay Harbor Butcher case, there isn't much of a connecting thread bridging the previous episodes.  The new characters in Miami PD, while okay, don't inject much new spark in the already established cast.  Doakes's obvious exclusion also leaves a void.  His antagonistic attitude towards Dexter always crackled tension, and in season two, their combative chemistry really soared into something special.  Deb, a one-note character who blossomed in season two, gets stuck romantically with an assigned PI.  I know Deb's lack of fatherly attention makes her insecure when she has no boyfriend, but surely, after surviving the Ice Truck Killer, she should stand more on her own. Batista and Masuka also get sent down several sideplots of personal affirmation and potential love interests, which all feel more contrived than convincing.Even the Skinner case never elevates past a sideshow distraction.  While the killer sounds terrifying from witnesses, the writers never properly develop his character, so he's as unmemorable as the case itself.What does work is Dexter's relationship with Miguel, and it's the only thing levitating season three past mediocrity.  Although some fans accuse Miguel of being Lila 2.0, that only serves to undermine the former character, and his intriguing connection to Dexter.  Yet even with Smits and Hall playing off their respective characters wonderfully and their relationship spurring the moral complexity Dexter is known for, their situation feels startlingly predetermined since episode two. Only twice did the writers throw genuine surprises, but swift, under whelming resolutions stifle them.  When the season finishes, it leaves you yearning for more.So what went wrong? It's hard to fault the core writing.  The dialogue is as sharp as ever, and the dark humor that keeps Dexter from feeling overly grim is still intact.  However, the writers' tendency to neatly wrap up every single plot thread by the end of each season is beginning to hinder the show.  Each season also follows a pattern of attachment Dexter has towards a key character, and while the characters' personalities' are varied, their journeys don't deviate enough. While it's understandable to resist completely serialized storytelling in this era of TV shows facing instant cancellation, it prevents Dexter from growing and nurturing. Season two did this well, but season three does not do it enough.What season two also did wonderfully is keep viewers on their toes.  The Bay Harbor Butcher case took Dexter into a wild direction, and even though the twists were random, they were always logical and exciting.  Even Dexter wasn't the same confident killer as before.  He was ambivalent and struggled to stay a step ahead of the FBI, who tried to oust him.  Seeing Dexter in constant weakness and losing control made for fascinating TV, but now, he resolves most of his problems with the intimacy of compiling an Excel spreadsheet.  Befriending Miguel did not challenge Dexter like I hoped, and that hurt the season's unpredictability factor.Without fresh ideas keeping the show alive, future seasons of Dexter won't sustain the show beyond gimmicks that go nowhere.  Fortunately, there are enough lingering plot threads that could open up new avenues of creativity, and get past the languid spell that bogged down season three.  Otherwise, Dexter might end in a whimper, and that's the worst that could happen to a once promising series.Lastly, for those of you who already watched season three, unless you really want to re-watch it, I wouldn't buy the DVD set. Based off my experience with the previous Dexter sets and advanced reviews of this one, the extras are barebones at best, and you can search for the Dexter interviews on the internet anyway.  The only justification for the skimp extras is the smaller price, compared to other TV shows on DVD. This will please those who don't care about additional content, but if you do, don't waste your money.",3,Jimmy Smits saves an otherwise lethargic outing of Dexter,1251590400,"08 30,

1149093,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B0015ABRE2,Douglas King,"[0, 0]","*** 1/2After two very strong seasons, ""Dexter"", the show about your friendly neighborhood serial killer, takes a slight quality dip. Not that it ever becomes poor or even mediocre, really. It's just that, so far with ""Dexter"", the show's seasons seem to be as good as the main villian, who usually serves as a twisted counterpart for Dexter. In Season 1, the Ice Truck Killer, who turned out to be Dexter's own brother, served this role. He offered Dexter a chance to find brotherhood, familiy, and acceptance, but in the end Dexter chose his ""fake"" life over a completely chaotic, amoral ""real"" life with his brother. In the second season, Lyla, a beautiful sociopath, also offered Dexter the chance for real acceptance by a disturbed kindred spirit, and yet he made the same choice in the end - to save the innocents in his life.The third season finds Dexter looking for a truthful connection with not a brother or a lover, but a friend. Miguel Prado, played by Jimmy Smitts, is a powerful, respected DA. Like with Lyla, the two have an instant attraction, probably because they can each see the other for who they really are - a damaged and disturbed vigilante. Unfortunately, the storyline is slow to really catch on, and for a while, the season seems to drag. It's only at the end of the season, when Miguel and Dexter engage in a killer's game of chess, that the storyline gains momentum.

One major change in the third season is the fantasy sequences with Dexter imaging what his father is thinking, as he gives his son guidance, ideas, or arouses guilt. In past seasons flashbacks were  used when Dexter was remembering his father. This fantasy elements adds an interesting sub layer to Dexter's thought processes, and perhaps could also be saying something about how Dexter is dealing with the trauma's of his life through fantasy, or perhaps even through split personality.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","In the kingdom of television, where morals are blurred, what salvages serial killer Dexter Morgan is that irresistibly playful gleam in his eye. He comes across as just so likable. Okay, he also comes across as a vicious sociopath when his ""Dark Passenger"" is allowed to peek out. But the showrunners did a very smart thing by allowing Dexter to narrate his own story. Privy to his thoughts, we observe his wicked sense of humor, which he mostly internalizes. And no his humor doesn't necessarily make him ""human,"" but it makes him more relatable. Dexter is very much aware of his limits, of how he struggles with social cues. We note a strange thing. Dexter occasionally finds himself conflicted now, between the pull of his girlfriend and her kids and his murderous urges. This third season Dexter veers dangerously away from the Code of Harry. He lets someone in. It bites him in the butt. Very unconventional behavior for a neat, orderly monster like Dexter.Safe again is Dexter as this new season opens. Last season he almost lost everything when his bags of body bits turned up off the coast of Miami and the media dubbed him ""The Bay Harbor Butcher"" (a nickname Dexter considers crass). But Dexter managed to elude the FBI-led manhunt, managed to pin his dark deeds on someone else. It helps a lot that Dex is entrenched in Miami Metro PD, working as the blood spatter expert. So he escaped unscathed, safe again. Except that now, somewhere in Miami, someone is skinning his victims alive. Dexter's Dark Passenger is licking its lips.And yet it must be so vexing having to maintain a perpetual mask. If you have to summarize this season with a sentence, it may be: ""Dexter makes a friend."" You almost can't blame Dexter's eventual caving in when the Assistant DA Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits) extends a hand of friendship, what with Dexter having shown kindness when Miguel's brother was murdered (never mind that it was Dexter who murdered him). This series thrives on its character-driven story arcs, allowing the strong performances of its lead and supporting cast and its featured guest star to anchor the strange plot twists and turns. I've said this elsewhere, but Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's insecure cop sister, Debra Morgan, is a stand-out for me. Carpenter expertly juggles her character's profuse profanity, bonehead impulses, her big heart and aching vulnerability. It sucks that, this time out, she gets saddled with a tepid love interest and an extremely annoying Internal Affairs officer who keeps nagging Deb to spy on her cop partner. Another bit of suck? The Skinner makes for a pretty weak recurring villain.Series 3 explores two particular themes. We see Dexter and Miguel's friendship blossom and then take a strange, dangerous turn. We also watch Dexter cope with the notion that he's about to be a father, what with Rita (Julie Benz), his damaged goods of a girlfriend, pregnant with his child. Can Dexter have it all? A convincing semblance of normality for him to blend in, as well as his extracurricular activities as Miami's unknown top predator? It won't be easy as Dexter finds himself torn. He genuinely likes Rita and her kids, and that pretense, that cover, is threatening to become the real thing.

1149111,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0015ABRE2,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","There is little to add after season 1 and season 2. It is going to still be the same. Well you did not read the books properly then or you did not watch the first two seasons properly. This one is entirely new and yet still the same. That's the miracle of this series: it seems to rejuvenate itself by getting older. So what's new that is not so new after all. First he got his Rita girlfriend pregnant. No surprise since he went to it bareback and there never was the slightest innuendo or plain detail about covering up before going out. Sooner or later with a woman who already has two kids! And of course she forgot the pill one night or something like that. Bound to happen, Sir. And it did happen. But you should see the fertile dog who is kind of wailing and whimpering in front of the reality he loves and desires more than anything else, but he can't admit it even to himself. It is true, morning sickness and all the rest on Rita's side, and the rest is a lot, like buying a new home, a wedding dress, choose between chocolate or hazelnut for the wedding cake, buying an engagement ring and all the rest, that can give you a vertigo. It is true an engagement ring looks like the receipt you get from the parking machine that gives you one hour's parking time, but well that is generally done, isn't it? New and not so new is his sister who falls in love with a local black singer, details in the series, look for them. This time he is not from Philadelphia or even farther away, and he is not the age of her father. It is true he is black, and he is a little bit wrapped up, but that's only muscle, isn't it? No, no, she is not getting that old yet and maybe in next season we'll have another family affair. Ah! Those Dexters! Quite new is the fact that Dexter gets a partner. In other words, parallel to his wife to be he gets some kind of professional attraction to some one of the same sex who is not a cop. But how can that work? Dexter is a solitary animal, like a spider, and it eats its partners after the dual carriageway trip, that spidery and long-legged insect that is not an insect. So how is the spider going to accept a partnership and yet keep his plate clean and his little secret night adventures for himself. And what about after the marriage? Well that will be for next season. You already know I guess, but I prefer waiting for the DVD. You can already pre-order it, with one click at Amazon if you are trustworthy, financially I mean. But as they say the apprentice gets always worse than the sorcerer. Remember Fantazia? You're going to say that is such a clich&eacute;. But it is so effective, but well at times we dream of the reverse, but then I am told it becomes a serial killer, not a serial justice cleanser. And then you do have some more details about the various polices that fight for a tidbit of macadam here and there, the Vice Squad, the Miami Dade Police Department and the Miami Sheriff's office. A little more about grossness but this time in a way with some reserve. There is a little bit less blood. That's maybe a good thing for the audience and the watching rates, but it takes some real gross horror out of the series. Dexter is becoming more civilized in a way. No real blood display like a bed floating in blood or a blood shower when opening the toilet door. But this season is definitely growing up to something that is or should be disquieting. Killing is becoming some kind of hobby, not a possession, not a deep impulse, not at all, just something you have to do everyday like washing your teeth or brushing your feet, or the reverse. No public outcry at the latest victims. No outcry at all at the disappearing hoodlums, or district attorney as for that. Though I must say the skinner is by far the vest invention in that season. It holds us firmly from the beginning to the end including the kidnaping. But hush, you are going to give away a spoiler. So enjoy it all in one go. It's only about ten hours of TV. A good nice night with some booze and peanuts, not too much popcorn though, especially since the price of cereal products is going to go up this year after the forest fires in Russia.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",5,Would you really want to waste your life between his hands?,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,4291,"['little', 'add', 'season', '1', 'season', '2', 'going', 'still', 'be', 'same', 'Well', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'properly', 'then', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'properly', 'one', 'entirely', 'new', 'yet', 'still', 'same', 'miracle', 'series', 'rejuvenate', 'getting', 'older', 'what', 'new', 'not', 'so', 'new', 'First', 'got', 'Rita', 'girlfriend', 'pregnant', 'surprise', 'went', 'bareback', 'there', 'never', 'was', 'slightest', 'innuendo', 'plain', 'detail', 'covering', 'up', 'going', 'out', 'Sooner', 'later', 'woman', 'who', 'already', 'two', 'kids', 'course', 'forgot', 'pill', 'one', 'night', 'something', 'Bound', 'happen', 'Sir', 'did', 'happen', 'should', 'see', 'fertile', 'dog', 'who', 'kind', 'wailing', 'whimpering', 'front', 'reality', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'ca', ""n't"", 'admit', 'even', 'true', 'morning', 'sickness', 'rest', 'Rita', 'side', 'rest', 'lot', 'buying', 'new', 'home', 'wedding', 'dress', 'choose', 'chocolate', 'hazelnut', 'wedding', 'cake', 'buying', 'engagement', 'ring', 'rest', 'can', 'give', 'vertigo', 'true', 'engagement', 'ring', 'looks', 'receipt', 'get', 'parking', 'machine', 'one', 'hour', 'parking', 'time', 'well', 'generally', 'done', ""n't"", 'New', 'not', 'so', 'new', 'sister', 'who', 'love', 'local', 'black', 'singer', 'details', 'series', 'look', 'time', 'not', 'Philadelphia', 'even', 'farther', 'away', 'not', 'age', 'father', 'true', 'black', 'little', 'bit', 'wrapped', 'up', 'only', 'muscle', ""n't"", 'No', 'not', 'getting', 'old', 'yet', 'maybe', 'next', 'season', ""'ll"", 'have', 'family', 'affair', 'Ah', 'Dexters', 'Quite', 'new', 'fact', 'Dexter', 'partner', 'other', 'words', 'parallel', 'wife', 'be', 'kind', 'professional', 'attraction', 'one', 'same', 'sex', 'who', 'not', 'cop', 'how', 'can', 'work', 'Dexter', 'solitary', 'animal', 'spider', 'partners', 'dual', 'carriageway', 'trip', 'spidery', 'long-legged', 'insect', 'not', 'insect', 'So', 'how', 'spider', 'going', 'accept', 'partnership', 'yet', 'keep', 'plate', 'clean', 'little', 'secret', 'night', 'adventures', 'what', 'marriage', 'Well', 'will', 'be', 'next', 'season', 'already', 'know', 'guess', 'prefer', 'waiting', 'DVD', 'can', 'already', 'pre-order', 'one', 'click', 'Amazon', 'are', 'trustworthy', 'financially', 'mean', 'say', 'apprentice', 'always', 'worse', 'sorcerer', 'Remember', 'Fantazia', ""'re"", 'going', 'say', 'clich', 'eacute', 'so', 'effective', 'well', 'times', 'dream', 'reverse', 'then', 'am', 'told', 'serial', 'killer', 'not', 'serial', 'justice', 'cleanser', 'then', 'do', 'have', 'more', 'details', 'various', 'polices', 'fight', 'tidbit', 'macadam', 'here', 'there', 'Vice', 'Squad', 'Miami', 'Dade', 'Police', 'Department', 'Miami', 'Sheriff', 'office', 'little', 'more', 'grossness', 'time', 'way', 'reserve', 'little', 'bit', 'less', 'blood', 'maybe', 'good', 'thing', 'audience', 'watching', 'rates', 'real', 'gross', 'horror', 'series', 'Dexter', 'becoming', 'more', 'civilized', 'way', 'real', 'blood', 'display', 'bed', 'floating', 'blood', 'blood', 'shower', 'when', 'opening', 'toilet', 'door', 'season', 'definitely', 'growing', 'up', 'something', 'should', 'be', 'disquieting', 'Killing', 'becoming', 'kind', 'hobby', 'not', 'possession', 'not', 'deep', 'impulse', 'not', 'just', 'something', 'have', 'do', 'everyday', 'washing', 'teeth', 'brushing', 'feet', 'reverse', 'public', 'outcry', 'latest', 'victims', 'outcry', 'disappearing', 'hoodlums', 'district', 'attorney', 'must', 'say', 'skinner', 'far', 'vest', 'invention', 'season', 'firmly', 'beginning', 'end', 'including', 'kidnaping', 'hush', 'are', 'going', 'give', 'away', 'spoiler', 'So', 'enjoy', 'one', 'go', 'only', 'about', 'ten', 'hours', 'TV', 'good', 'nice', 'night', 'booze', 'peanuts', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'especially', 'price', 'cereal', 'products', 'going', 'go', 'up', 'year', 'forest', 'fires', 'Russia.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",Dexter: Season 3

Miguel Prado (wonderfully played by Jimmy Smits) enjoys the thrill of the hunt and kill as much as Dexter does. Just one problem, Miguel may like it a bit too much.  This makes him impulsive and reckless.  Miguel wants to do things HIS way.  He certainly doesn't want to follow Dexter's code.Thus begins a wonderful cat and mouse game between these two BFFs.... Best Fiends Forever!!  How much can Dexter trust Miguel with his dark secrets?  How receptive is Miguel to receiving Dexter's instruction?  Just how much can he divulge to Prado without leaving himself exposed and vulnerable? The interaction between Dex and Miguel is fabulous.  These two killers play off each other very well.And, speaking of breaking the rules, Dexter accidently breaks one of his own, taking the life of an ""innocent"".  Dexter also learns that Harry had dark secrets of his own that he kept very well hidden. Dexter's errand of mercy (the key lime pie) was very poignant and touching.  It gave us greater insight into showing how far his compassion for another could extend.Debra is still the same ol' emotional basket case she's always been, and Masuka is still a raunchy sexist dawg (my absolute most favorite supporting character, plus he has some of the best lines in the show). Batista finds a bit of happiness.  Laguerta seems to have matured emotionally as a leader and found her niche this season.Initially Rita was great as she was broken and emotionally damaged, thus she was the perfect girlfriend for Dex.  She didn't make too many demands of him.  In season two and three, she developed more of a backbone, but it seemed to turn her into a shrew and a harpy more than any thing else.  Heck, I'd see to it I had nocturnal hobbies that kept me out of the house too if I had to deal with her clingy tirades!!  Dexter seems to chafe at the constraints.  Plus, by season's end, Dexter's getting married and we have a baby being thrown into the mix (usually a series killer right there)....Diaper Daddy Dexter! The picture of domestic bliss and tushy changing duty doesn't seem to fit our favorite serial killer.I love this series, but I felt season three just didn't match up to that raw, thought provoking, tight, edge of your seat thrill ride we came to expect, and one for which I thoroughly enjoyed, in seasons one and two.  Season three missed that boat in delivering that same level of intensity.  Don't get me wrong, even watching a BAD episode of Dexter would be preferable to any other show out there, but overall, this season just seemed to be mildly disappointing and slightly lacking.  It wasn't as intellectually challenging to the viewer as seasons one and two.  Some story threads just dead ended without ever being fully explored. It was predictable.  The previous seasons definately kept the viewer on their toes and guessing.Still, this series is the best thing out there and I will continue to watch Dexter evolve.~ jade ~",4,The Dark Passenger is out Hitchhiking this Season!,1270512000,"04 6, 2010",2010,3113,"['king', 'saran', 'wrap', 'industrial', 'strength', 'garbage', 'bags', 'back', 'become', ':coughs', 'domesticated.', 'Dexter', 'found', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'man', 'own', 'heart', 'Miguel', 'Prado', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'thrill', 'hunt', 'kill', 'as', 'much', 'Dexter', 'Just', 'one', 'problem', 'Miguel', 'may', 'like', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'impulsive', 'reckless', 'Miguel', 'do', 'things', 'HIS', 'way', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'want', 'follow', 'Dexter', 'code.Thus', 'wonderful', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'two', 'BFFs', 'Best', 'Fiends', 'Forever', 'How', 'much', 'can', 'Dexter', 'trust', 'Miguel', 'dark', 'secrets', 'How', 'receptive', 'Miguel', 'receiving', 'Dexter', 'instruction', 'Just', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'divulge', 'Prado', 'leaving', 'exposed', 'vulnerable', 'interaction', 'Dex', 'Miguel', 'fabulous', 'two', 'killers', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'very', 'well.And', 'speaking', 'breaking', 'rules', 'Dexter', 'accidently', 'one', 'own', 'taking', 'life', 'innocent', 'Dexter', 'also', 'Harry', 'had', 'dark', 'secrets', 'own', 'kept', 'very', 'well', 'hidden', 'Dexter', 'errand', 'mercy', 'key', 'lime', 'pie', 'was', 'very', 'poignant', 'touching', 'gave', 'greater', 'insight', 'showing', 'how', 'far', 'compassion', 'could', 'extend.Debra', 'still', 'same', 'ol', 'emotional', 'basket', 'case', 'always', 'been', 'Masuka', 'still', 'raunchy', 'sexist', 'dawg', 'absolute', 'most', 'favorite', 'supporting', 'character', 'best', 'lines', 'show', 'Batista', 'bit', 'happiness', 'Laguerta', 'have', 'matured', 'emotionally', 'leader', 'found', 'niche', 'season.Initially', 'Rita', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'broken', 'emotionally', 'damaged', 'thus', 'was', 'perfect', 'girlfriend', 'Dex', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'too', 'many', 'demands', 'season', 'two', 'three', 'developed', 'more', 'backbone', 'seemed', 'turn', 'shrew', 'harpy', 'more', 'thing', 'else', 'Heck', ""'d"", 'see', 'had', 'nocturnal', 'hobbies', 'kept', 'house', 'too', 'had', 'deal', 'clingy', 'tirades', 'Dexter', 'chafe', 'constraints', 'season', 'end', 'Dexter', 'getting', 'married', 'have', 'baby', 'being', 'thrown', 'mix', 'usually', 'series', 'killer', 'right', 'there', 'Daddy', 'Dexter', 'picture', 'domestic', 'bliss', 'tushy', 'changing', 'duty', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'favorite', 'serial', 'killer.I', 'love', 'series', 'felt', 'season', 'three', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'raw', 'thought', 'provoking', 'tight', 'edge', 'seat', 'thrill', 'ride', 'came', 'expect', 'one', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'Season', 'three', 'missed', 'boat', 'delivering', 'same', 'level', 'intensity', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'even', 'watching', 'BAD', 'episode', 'Dexter', 'would', 'be', 'preferable', 'other', 'show', 'there', 'overall', 'season', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'mildly', 'disappointing', 'slightly', 'lacking', 'was', ""n't"", 'intellectually', 'challenging', 'viewer', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'story', 'threads', 'just', 'dead', 'ended', 'ever', 'being', 'fully', 'explored', 'was', 'predictable', 'previous', 'seasons', 'definately', 'kept', 'viewer', 'toes', 'guessing.Still', 'series', 'best', 'thing', 'there', 'will', 'continue', 'watch', 'Dexter', 'evolve.~', 'jade', '~']",Dexter: Season 3

Wise, understated, committed (ahem, to various things), surprising, loyal--both Dexter Morgan and ""Dexter the Third Season"" do not disappoint, and always continue to dazzle with insights and reversals, with surprises and fulfilled expectations.With the advent of Jimmy Smits, as Miami's charismatic Assistant District Attorney with eyes on bigger prizes, no matter the method, the show takes a shocking direction. Dexter takes on a partner! No, Dexter, don't tell anyone! But he does. Miguel Prado (Smits) recognizes in Dexter a kindred spirit--and I'm telling you, Reader/Viewer, you cannot guess what direction the program will go with this character and his own secrets. Like Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump, ""That's all I can say about that."" But suffice it to say that Smits brings to the series an exciting dimension and some over-the-top acting. He must have gone home after every shoot, saying, ""Whooeee, that was fun!""If Season One was an introductory/explanatory show, and Season Two was about Dexter developing his relationship with Rita, his girlfriend, while his sister Debra exposed her raw, but tender heart to the FBI profiler, then Season Three is about deep relationships, deep commitments all around. In some ways I like Season Three best (only with the two preceding seasons laying groundwork).Again, trying not to reveal any secrets, I want to state that THE most significant scene in all three seasons comes in the last episode when Dexter confronts Ramon Prado in jail (Miguel's brother). Dexter was under the assumption that Miguel covered for his bad brother all his life. Dexter was about to reveal to Ramon just who Miguel was. In an act of reversal--one of several the season takes, Ramon reveals that, no, he, Ramon, covered for the dark secrets of his famous, respected brother. Dexter takes that reversal of information and does a reversal himself. My throat tightened with Dexter's extreme compassion and consideration, making the series just balloon with the power of human empathy and dignity. Quite ironic-- yes?--in the framework of a brutal serial killer, but there it is--a deeply moving moment in television historyHow Dexter manages another reversal in his confrontation with the Skinner--this season's notorious front candidate for ""baddest"" villain, is again, a moment of television triumph. Oh, how I love this series!Deep relationships. Deep commitments. Another impending and important moment is Dexter's proposal to Rita and her acceptance, then season-long wedding plans. Not to be excluded, Dexter's long-time police friend and friend of his father's, is the subject of several episodes, all with the intent of showing Dexter's deep loyalty and commitment. He is one caring friend.The new sergeant gets a love interest in a most unusual manner. The old saying, Looking for love in all the wrong places, sometimes can be reversed. Sister Debra also has a new love interest--and conflict of interest with an ongoing case. Decisions about commitments must be made here, too, all adding reversals and genuine compassion to the series.But Dexter's relationships are foremost and they do not disappoint. Nor does the series. Nor does this season.

1149125,AX329NHW6B7BA,B0015ABRE2,"Judy Smith ""judylynnsbooks""","[4, 6]","I watched season 3 on video on demand from showtime. It was great watching the whole season straight through without waiting a week in between each one. I'm not sure I could have waited between shows to know what happened! The show gets better and better all the time. This season had Dexter making friends with the assistant DA who was played by Jimmy Smits. It begins with Dexter killing his brother kind of by accident but of course the d.a. doesn't know that part and wants him to find the killer since he shows such a talent for helping out in that department. Interesting concept, huh. Find the killer when you are the killer! Does this deter Dexter from becoming his friend anyway? Not a bit. This season also has Rita pregnant. Will Dexter do the right thing and marry her? Or better yet, SHOULD he marry her? I mean what is going to happen when there is a little Dexter around? Will big Dexter take him to soccer games or to the shooting range? It will be interesting seeing what kind of daddy Dexter makes! Jimmy Smit plays his role well and it's funny watching poor old Dexter trying to become a friend to someone when the concept is so alien to him. But we want him to have a friend as bad as he wants one, because we truly like Dexter. He tries so hard to do the right thing by his friends and if it meant turning himself in rather than killing a friend, then we believe that is what he would do. He almost had to do that at the end of last season when Doaks figured out what he was...but one of the women who loved Dexter took care of the problem for him. Those women of his will always take care of Dexter when they can. And now that he's marrying one of them, she can't testify against him if she ever figures out what he is (not much chance of that since she considers him a great guy). But guess what...that thought has not crossed his mind yet. He's very naive where women are concerned. That just makes you like him more and you want those women there to protect him since you can't!

1149127,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B0015ABRE2,Kasey G,"[1, 1]","*THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*The plots this season were more all over the map than in previous years. That's not to say ""Dexter"" has become stale--it hasn't.After their rocky relationship in Season Two, Dexter and Rita get back together and he eventually pops the question. In the episodes leading up to the wedding, he sometimes questions his ability to be a good husband and parent, but in the Season Finale, a conversation with Harry and certain desperate circumstances convince Dexter he is more than ready and willing to be a family man.Deb gets a new partner in the cocky but twitchy Quinn, who gives off suspicious vibes for most of the season. Deb jeopardizes her chances of finally getting her shield by sleeping with Quinn's Criminal Informant. Again, things in the romance department don't turn out easy for her. There is a nice scene between her and Dexter as the wedding day approaches and Dex asks her to stand up for him.With Doakes out of the picture, Angel gets promoted AND gets a girlfriend. The latter comes about through some rather unusual circumstances.Masuka isn't used nearly enough, and his big moment of the season comes in taking charge of the preparations for Dexter's bachelor party.But Season Three isn't all about love and marriage.Dexter's first kill of the season goes awry and he inadvertently ends up offing the kid brother of District Attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits), who becomes the pivotal figure in Dex's life this 'go-round.At first Dexter feels uncomfortable getting close and being pals with the man who's kid brother he murdered. But soon he relishes having his first real friend and the two bond until slowly Miguel discovers Dexter's tendencies and beliefs. It seems they are not so different from his own and he wants Dexter to become his partner in carrying out their special brand of justice.By mid-season, Dexter realizes that Prado is even more blood-thirsty for justice than Dexter himself. Things begin to unravel in many ways once Dexter ceases to uphold ""The Code"".The flashbacks with Harry are almost non-existent this season. Instead we see him pop up when Dexter needs his advice (I didn't care for the blurry filming technique they employed for this). Most of it is to warn and scold him about getting too close to Miguel, advice Dexter chooses to ignore until it's too late to tame the monster he helped create.A serial killer known as The Skinner who keeps his victims under surveillance while tree-trimming is one of the continuing threads this season. However, this storyline did not have the same impact as the Ice Truck Killer or Bay Harbour Butcher of previous seasons, probably because Dexter really has no direct link with The Skinner. This diminishes some of the impact and suspense.Kudos to Lauren Velez for bringing more layers to the complex role of Maria Laguerta. For a character I absoutely hated in the first half of Season One, she has come to be one of my favorites. During Season Three, Maria's loyalties are really put to the test, as is her trust. And despite her bad treatment of Deb in the past, there is a terrific moment at the end of the season that totally exonerates her.Another good thing about this season is that Rita finally gets a backbone, making for a better character. But as the wedding approaches, Dexter discovers Rita, too, is hiding a secret about her past.In conclusion, I will say this season went down much smoother and quicker than the first two. I was shocked when I put in the fourth disc to find we were already up to the Season Finale. So much had happened and at the same time it seemed like not enough had happened.I will say that this is still my favorite current show along with ""Weeds"" and ""Desperate Housewives"", though both of those are starting to show their age. Thankfully, so far ""Dexter"" has not.I appreciated having bonus episodes of ""United States of Tara"" on this set.

We're more interested in having sex with Rita, her kids are irratating by now, Debra is far too safe and about to have an affair with the new blonde cop (who is himself boring, safe, and predictable), and meanwhile Doakes is long gone so there's no one around to hassle Dexter about his devious nocturnal activities.Dexter himself is even wound down a bit, his killings mere pretense now and less ritualistic.

1149134,AR3HV5WH2I4B2,B0015ABRE2,"Kristopher KR ""Um, yeah.""","[42, 48]","Dexter is, hands down, the most brilliantly written television series I have ever watched. The pacing is downright perfection, the story telling and weaving is an absolute powerhouse of entertainment. Plus, the dialogue is nothing short of utterly amazing.The cast is something that award shows lust for.  Michael C. Hall was always brilliant onSix Feet Under - The Complete Series Gift Set.  Since episode one he has proven that he can make a totally different character (than the interally conflicted gay brother who owns a funeral home w/his family.)  He truly is an actor in the caliber of DeNiro or Nicholson, in my opinion.The rest of the cast is amazing too.  Jennifer CarpenterQuarantine (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray] is often called the weak link (by my wife and almost every woman I know for some reason,) however I disagree, she's just as brilliant in her internal conflicts than everyone else.  She's often the conscience in Dexter's mind when there is none otherwise.  That's not to say Dexter doesn't have morals, but there are certain things that his sister points out which seems like a light bulb goes off in the Dexter's head.Jimmy Smits in any TV show seems to improve it by a factor of three.  This series didn't need it so much, but he's a very welcome addition.  In fact, I compared the 'Donut Shop Scene' in this season to the DeNiro/Pacino coffee shop scene inHeat (Two-Disc Special Edition).This season is full of twists and turns which come like an 18 wheeler truck from out of nowhere.  They blindside you like any great mystery and story does. Constantly brilliant is an understatement when it comes to Dexter and his way of thinking and the problems he faces.From episode one, the story arc is a white-knuckle thrill ride which grabs you from the get-go.The only issue which could be seen as a fault to anyone who hasn't seen the last two seasons, is that you MUST watch the first 24 episodes.  Without knowing the history of Dexter, you are completely lost.

1149135,A356RFKNIG043B,B0015ABRE2,K. Swanson,"[0, 0]","4.4 starsI enjoyed this more than the second season, mainly due to the entire arc with Smits. He works well with Hall and some of their scenes together are excellent. But as before, I find the side plots with the other actors less and less compelling.Carpenter just doesn't impress me much; she could easily be in any other boring typical cop show out there, ditto for most everyone here except Hall, who continues to carry the series along with the very good writing. Angel seems to be the only one here truly progressing as an actor, and his scenes are the pick of the non-Dexter litter.I must say, however, that this was the season where I finally realized how sick this series and my/our love of it is. Seriously, folks. How mentally ill and numbed to violence are we now that we can watch the increasingly graphic murders on this show and be entertained by them?It hit me when Dexter is with Prado as he murders his first victim in the kill room. Whereas in the first season we got mostly visual suggestions of the brutality, in a much more artistic and Hitchcockian way, now the producers are making straight out snuff films. Watch the camera when Prado stabs the guy; it shows the knife go right in to the hilt, then it show Prado's almost orgasmic glee in murdering this guy, and then it pans to Dexter's grim smile, as if to say, isn't it fun to kill people?I had a sudden queasy feeling when I saw that, and it hit me pretty clearly how sick I and we have become when our weekly entertainment is watching carefully-made pictures of the joy that a murderer feels. The moral compass of this show seems to mirror our own capacity for ever more brutality; the more you get the more you want.Just like pornography. That is in fact what this show is becoming: death porn. In their desire to show the inner workings of a killer, they have realized that this format will let them make weekly snuff films, however blase, and each season they are stepping up the intensity of the graphic murders. The ratings are just rocketing, though, so all must be well.And we sit back and eat popcorn and smile as people are carefully disemboweled on screen. Is this not sick? I think it is, but just like the boiling frogs we have been lowered into this cauldron slowly over the decades until we accept that this is entertainment. At this rate, how long until we broadcast capital punishment via pay-per-view? Or simply stop caring that as a nation we have become inured and numb to murder and torture?Speaking of which, isn't it time for our greatest killer, Dick Chainysaw, to appear on this show and kill some folks along with our hero Dex? How awesome that would be. ""They deserve it, Dexter. We are Good, and they are Bad. This is Justice.""And of course, I will now get comments from the (always bravely anonymous) fanboys about how this is just a tv show, and don't be such a wimp. Yet I find it more than coincidental that as tv gets sicker and sicker, we are increasingly unconcerned by our government killing and torturing people, all in the name of Justice.In the end, that's what lets them get away with this show: Dexter is killing bad people! They deserve to die! And we want to see them killed as slowly and brutally as possible.So who's really sick? Maybe it's we as a nation that need to be laid out and tied down on Dexter's killing table, with pictures of the millions of innocent people our tax dollars have killed while we look the other way, from Cambodian carpet bombings to Langley-remote-controlled drones that may be murdering yet more innocent Pakistanis this very moment.And then Dexter will say, ""It was never enough, was it? You needed ever more resources, ever more markets, so you could live your detached, pseudo-comfortable lives free from thinking about how many innocent people died to create that fake world of Fake comfort. All so you could sit in your living rooms and watch tv shows about how murder is really not so bad...as long as you kill the right people.""But hey, I'm just kidding.Let's just relax, and be entertained.",4,"Good, but first season's still the best...and who knew America would love this death porn/weekly snuff film so much?",1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,4052,"['4.4', 'starsI', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'second', 'season', 'mainly', 'due', 'entire', 'arc', 'Smits', 'well', 'Hall', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'excellent', 'find', 'side', 'plots', 'other', 'actors', 'less', 'less', 'compelling.Carpenter', 'just', ""n't"", 'impress', 'much', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'other', 'boring', 'typical', 'cop', 'show', 'there', 'ditto', 'most', 'everyone', 'here', 'Hall', 'who', 'carry', 'series', 'very', 'good', 'writing', 'Angel', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'here', 'truly', 'progressing', 'actor', 'scenes', 'are', 'pick', 'non-Dexter', 'litter.I', 'must', 'say', 'however', 'was', 'season', 'where', 'finally', 'realized', 'how', 'sick', 'series', 'my/our', 'love', 'Seriously', 'folks', 'How', 'mentally', 'ill', 'numbed', 'violence', 'are', 'now', 'can', 'watch', 'increasingly', 'graphic', 'murders', 'show', 'be', 'entertained', 'hit', 'when', 'Dexter', 'Prado', 'first', 'victim', 'kill', 'room', 'Whereas', 'first', 'season', 'got', 'mostly', 'visual', 'suggestions', 'brutality', 'much', 'more', 'artistic', 'Hitchcockian', 'way', 'now', 'producers', 'are', 'making', 'straight', 'out', 'snuff', 'films', 'Watch', 'camera', 'when', 'Prado', 'stabs', 'guy', 'knife', 'go', 'right', 'hilt', 'then', 'show', 'Prado', 'almost', 'orgasmic', 'glee', 'murdering', 'guy', 'then', 'Dexter', 'grim', 'smile', 'say', ""n't"", 'fun', 'kill', 'people', 'had', 'sudden', 'queasy', 'feeling', 'when', 'saw', 'hit', 'pretty', 'clearly', 'how', 'sick', 'have', 'become', 'when', 'weekly', 'entertainment', 'watching', 'carefully-made', 'pictures', 'joy', 'murderer', 'feels', 'moral', 'compass', 'show', 'mirror', 'own', 'capacity', 'ever', 'more', 'brutality', 'more', 'get', 'more', 'want.Just', 'pornography', 'fact', 'what', 'show', 'becoming', 'death', 'porn', 'desire', 'show', 'inner', 'workings', 'killer', 'have', 'realized', 'format', 'will', 'let', 'make', 'weekly', 'snuff', 'films', 'however', 'blase', 'season', 'are', 'stepping', 'up', 'intensity', 'graphic', 'murders', 'ratings', 'are', 'just', 'rocketing', 'though', 'must', 'be', 'sit', 'back', 'eat', 'popcorn', 'smile', 'people', 'are', 'carefully', 'disemboweled', 'screen', 'not', 'sick', 'think', 'just', 'boiling', 'frogs', 'have', 'been', 'lowered', 'cauldron', 'slowly', 'decades', 'accept', 'entertainment', 'rate', 'how', 'long', 'broadcast', 'capital', 'punishment', 'pay-per-view', 'simply', 'stop', 'caring', 'nation', 'have', 'become', 'inured', 'numb', 'murder', 'torture', 'Speaking', ""n't"", 'time', 'greatest', 'killer', 'Dick', 'Chainysaw', 'appear', 'show', 'kill', 'folks', 'hero', 'Dex', 'How', 'awesome', 'would', 'be', 'deserve', 'Dexter', 'are', 'Good', 'are', 'Bad', 'Justice', 'course', 'will', 'now', 'get', 'comments', 'always', 'bravely', 'anonymous', 'how', 'just', 'tv', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'such', 'wimp', 'find', 'more', 'coincidental', 'tv', 'sicker', 'sicker', 'are', 'increasingly', 'unconcerned', 'government', 'killing', 'torturing', 'people', 'name', 'Justice.In', 'end', 'what', 'get', 'away', 'show', 'Dexter', 'killing', 'bad', 'people', 'deserve', 'die', 'want', 'see', 'killed', 'slowly', 'brutally', 'possible.So', 'who', 'really', 'sick', 'Maybe', 'nation', 'need', 'be', 'laid', 'out', 'tied', 'down', 'Dexter', 'killing', 'table', 'pictures', 'millions', 'innocent', 'people', 'tax', 'dollars', 'have', 'killed', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'Cambodian', 'carpet', 'bombings', 'Langley-remote-controlled', 'drones', 'may', 'be', 'murdering', 'yet', 'more', 'innocent', 'Pakistanis', 'very', 'moment.And', 'then', 'Dexter', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'never', 'enough', 'was', 'needed', 'ever', 'more', 'resources', 'ever', 'more', 'markets', 'could', 'live', 'detached', 'pseudo-comfortable', 'lives', 'free', 'thinking', 'how', 'many', 'innocent', 'people', 'died', 'create', 'fake', 'world', 'Fake', 'comfort', 'could', 'sit', 'living', 'rooms', 'watch', 'tv', 'shows', 'how', 'murder', 'really', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'as', 'long', 'kill', 'right', 'people', 'hey', ""'m"", 'just', 'kidding.Let', 'just', 'relax', 'be', 'entertained']",Dexter: Season 3
1149136,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B0015ABRE2,K.T. May,"[1, 2]","Blood spatter analyst by day, blood spatterer by night.  Dexter Morgan, (Michael C. Hall), serial killer extraordinaire, is back for a third season of Dexter.  And believe it or not, the series is still just as good without James Doakes, (Erik King).We start off season three with Dexter finally feeling comfortable in his own skin.  He's even able to enjoy having sex with his girlfriend, Rita, (Julie Benz), instead of just pretending to enjoy it for her sake.  But, of course, his world is turned upside down when at the very beginning of the season, Rita announces that she is pregnant.  Dexter isn't sure what to do.  How can he raise a child?  Especially when all he can envision is that child turning out to be another serial killer like him?Meanwhile, there's a new guy, Joey Quinn, (Desmond Harrington), at the office and Dexter's sister, Deb, (Jennifer Carpenter, Hall's now real-life wife), is being hounded by Yuki, (Liza Lapira), for information on him.  Maria, (Lauren Velez), promotes Angel, (David Zayas), which helps him to work more closely with Deb, trying to get her to fine-tune herself, to get a handle on how real police work is done, instead of letting her mouth get her into trouble, as usual.A highlight of the new season is that Dexter starts breaking his code when it comes to killing people, either by accident or because they threaten to harm his family.  Normally, he would only kill people who had killed previously killed others.  Not anymore.  He even gets caught by Miguel Prado, (Jimmy Smits), a powerful ADA who figures prominently in this season, and, indebted to Dexter for killing his brother's murderer, Prado befriends him.  Dexter can feel his guards coming down and worries about his newfound friendship.  While all of this is going on, Rita is trying to keep her family together, since when Astor, (Christina Robinson), and Cody, (Preston Bailey), find out that their mom is going to have another baby, Astor acts out, thinking her mom and Dexter should be married if they're going to welcome a baby.Deb's penchant for trash talk becomes more of a punchline in this season, since they use a lot of her long strings of lackluster verbiage as her reactions to certain situations, such as finding out that Dexter is to become a father.  She almost loses an informant with her brash attitude but once she starts to lighten up a bit, with Angel's help, she begins a closer relationship with him.The handling of this season's serial killer is also a bit different.  At the beginning, the department believes they have it all figured out, but as the evidence mounts against them, they realize that the person they had in mind all along, Miguel's brother, ""Freebo"",  was not the right person after all.  Of course, Dexter and Miguel are already aware of this, mainly because Dexter killed Freebo and Miguel caught him doing it, but when bodies start turning up with long slices of skin removed, they soon realize that they have another new serial killer on their hands.Will Dexter catch this season's killer before the police department does?  How will he rationalize killing people who never killed anyone?  Can he be a father?  Will he marry Rita?  So many questions but worth sticking around for the answers.

It is more about humanity and questions what makes us human.  In this season, Dexter who has determined he has no feelings continues to evolve and attempts to learn what others feel and how they form relationships with each other.  Something he has determined that he cannot do.  This season he finds his long term girlfriend pregnant and that is important in his life to marry her and be a father to the other two children she has as well.  How does he reconcile a more normal life as a husband and father with a secret life of a serial killer?  He finds that marrying will require him to live with his new family but he wants to continue to live alone and keep his own apartment.  He will have to be home nights to eat dinner with the family and attend family activities not just pizza night once a week and a date night on the weekends.  It's all too heady for a serial killer who keeps shady hours and needs to hide his whereabouts to carry out his vocation.In the desire to find a friend who he can allow to see the real him, he finds a prosector named Miguel Prado, who also is frustrated when he knows that the law has set a murderer free and there will be no justice.  Accidentally, Dexter ""shows his hand"" and he hopes that Miguel has the ability to understand and follow the same code as Dexter does.  But people are different and Miguel has his own code which doesn't fit the moral code Dexter and his father long ago mapped out for him.  This season has a lot going for it but I did feel it was the weakest season until season 6 came along.  Still season 3 moves the Dexter story along and the development of the character as he transforms over several seasons as a three dimensional character rather than one just written on a page as he sees himself.

It spurts and sputters along trying to find its legs, which it does in the last couple of episodes of the season, but its a tedious journey to get to those episodes. Season three has great character development and not just for Dexter. Each member of the cast fleshes out as much more fully developed and realized individuals. These are my T.V.

As a big fan of the show, I was concerned how Season 3 would play out now that one of my favorite characters, James Doakes, is out of the picture. I never should have worried, because the third season of ""Dexter"" was just as fabulous as the first two. This season mainly focuses on Dexter's (Michael C. Hall) personal relationships. He's working through some major issues with his deceased father, Harry (James Remar), and his relationship with Rita (Julie Benz) takes a surprising turn when she announces that she's pregnant with Dexter's child. All of these emotions cause Dexter to turn to an unlikely person...Assistant District Attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits), who takes a liking to Dexter and makes it his personal mission to become Dexter's BFF. No one is more surprised by this than Dexter, who discovers that he has more in common with Miguel than he possibly imagined. For the first time in his life, Dexter has a friend whom he can rely on and share (some) of his dirty little secrets with. After a while, however, Dexter realizes that there's much more to Miguel than he originally thought, and decides that the ADA may not be BFF material after all.This is a great season chock full of twists, turns, and excitement. In addition to Dexter's storyline, there are great subplots involving a new serial killer (""The Skinner""), Deborah's (Jennifer Carpenter) relationship with a CI, Angel's (David Zayas) recovery from his divorce, and Maria's (Lauren Velez) coping with the death of her former partner in Season 2. I am always impressed by the way this series constantly surprises its audience and keeps evolving these dynamic characters. The whole concept of Dexter making a friend was so simple, and yet carried the entire season extremely well (thanks in part to an outstanding performance by Smits). My one complaint about Season 3 is that it's already over, and I have to wait a long time before the arrival of Season 4!

Durham ""Big Evil""","[5, 5]","Dexter was a plesant little surprise for me when it debuted on Showtime a few years ago, and it doesn't slow down one bit in its third season.  Season three of Dexter kicks off with our serial killer protagonist (Michael C. Hall) doing what he does while still questioning the code bestowed on him by his late foster father Harry (James Remar).  It isn't long before Rita (Julie Benz) has some surprising news for Dex, and the surprises keep coming with the arrival of Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits), an ADA who forms an unlikely friendship with Dex, and has some secrets of his own to boot.  What makes Dexter so good in the first place is that we never quite know which direction the series will take, and there's enough genuine surprises and great moments to continue to help make the series the best show on premium cable TV today.  Hall remains simply magnetic in the title role, while there's still great supporting work from Jennifer Carpenter, David Zayas, and Lauren Valez as Dex's co-workers, whom are still unaware of his extracurricular activities.  The season ends on a note that I wasn't too fond of at first, but it's fitting in the darkly quirky way that the show has been since day one, and really sets up some possible bigger developments to come in the future.

1149164,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B0015ABRE2,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[1, 2]","Maybe it is Michael C. Hall who was in Six Feet Under,  or perhaps it was other elements, but something about Hall and shows like Dexter and Six Feet Under seem insidious. Recently I watched the first three seasons of Dexter. I must say the show plods along trying to build up some momentum. The lack of momentum is not helped by the weak scripts and acting. And in the final episode, or the one just before that one, was pretty bad. Dexter kills the ""Skinner"" by snapping his neck. In the struggle the Skinner cuts Dexter. Dexter's blood was left at the crime scene. Somehow the blood evidence didn't connect to Dexter. The blood evidence wasn't even mentioned or perhaps collected, for it was never cited in the show. I've watched a lot of CSI, eleven seasons, and four seasons of CSI Miami and if one is to believe anything about forensics investigations then Dexter's ass would have been in jail from the collected blood evidence. Also, Dexter threw the Skinner from a second story in the warehouse and not one police officer or detective saw him. The committed viewer is askde to conclude that the ""Skinner"" committed suicide by cop car and for NO apparent reason. That was the explanation given by Dexter's sister, Debra Morgan/Jennifer Carpenter, the newest detective of the precinct. We are to believe that the state coroner would not see signs of a forced broken neck or bruising from the struggle. Then another thing that bugged me was the CI, the criminal informant, who got two huge pieces of skin removed from his back, he is never shown in the hospital. The CI healed up basically overnight. Where and when did the CI get skin graphs? The skin graphs would have had to come from his own body. The CI would have been out of action for several months, at least with much painful recuperation time. Why was that glossed over? Then detective Angel Batista gets in a relationship with a blonde detective. The two have a very a sweet connection which was suppossed to be his personal redemption from his demons, demons that led him to prostitutes and what not. Why did the relationship ""evaporate"" and END at the conclusion of season 3? I am guessing the woman who played the blonde detective did not come back for season 4. So early in the first or second episode of season four, Angel is over at Mar&iacute;a LaGuerta/ Lauren V&eacute;lez and the two of them proceed to have sex. And Angel Batista goes from a very healthy relationship to a very seedy one. Also, I'd like to ask a question which is probably on the minds of many people, is Jennifer Carpenter ANOREXIC? Her name might be Jennifer but she looks to be living like Karen Carpenter from the Carpenters who we all know DIED from anorexia.Ultimately I sold all four seasons of Dexter, not having watched 90% of season four because I almost had a couple of panic attacks. I haven't had those for years and I watch lots of horror, sci fi, etc. But I will say that Six Feet Under also disturbed me. I think it might just be Michael C. Hall. Yes, I know he's almost your lovable serial killer in this tv series but ultimately this show bothered my conscience. It seemingly disturbed me on a deep level, or it helped to upset me. I'm not much of a Christian but I was much more of one about 20 years ago and I tried sincerely to live a Christian life. Ultimately I felt like I was putting horrific garbage into my mind. I mean we live in a world and a country where serial killing is commonplace but yet we have a show, a very seedy one, that celebrates a serial killer. The celebrated serial killer also becomes a biological father, a step father for two, and a husband. Yes, I know Dexter kills people who escaped justice, but combine all the killing with some nudity, a tremendous amount of profanity, throw in some creepy visions from ""the father"" and you have some images and situations for a mind to dwell upon. This show may have helped me to almost have two panic attacks, or it may be that I might soon be buying my brother out of the house we inherited from our mother. Surely Dexter was a part of my anxiety, so I took the four seasons to the pawn shop and got $12 for the lot.I am still curious as to how that show would have proceeded. The part of me that wants to be entertained is pissed at the part of me that has a troubled conscience. Call it a good instinct of mine or call me some sort of crazy weak minded coward but I just simply chose to put the show Dexter out of my life. A show like Dexter can be entertaining but it also desensitizes us to very real horror. Just this week I saw a news story about mice in the police evidence locker at Wichita, Kansas. The mice ate some marijuana evidence. I couldn't help but be reminded of Dennis Rader the infamous BTK Killer who Bound, Tortured and Killed women in Wichita. Dennis Rader is THE real serial killer of Wichita, Kansas. He lived and worked amongst the people of Wichita. He was considered by many to be a model citizen. Rader had a wife, kids, and was a deacon in the church and on the side he KILLED REAL LIVE WOMEN for kicks. He was caught when the police traced a computer disc back to a computer he had used at his church. He taunted the church with messages he created on a church computer. That was his downfall. And how much Dennis Rader had in common with Dexter the tv serial killer.I gave Dexter and Showtime three Seasons on dvd, that much of my life, and in the end it probably didn't help me at all emotionally, spiritually or intellectually but I guess I was entertained for a while, or as entertained as one can be by such a seedy, weak show. Compare Dexter to HBO's The Sopranos, it's the same sort of crap shoot. That being said I have every season of The Sopranos and NO, I don' think the viewing experience has done me any good but, OH YES, it entertained me for seven seasons. It's amazing the garbage we put into our minds as we seek to be entertained. I guess for the most part we will never learn. I wonder how many disturbed people will be influenced by Dexter? Oh, and I still have a desire to watch Dexter, I just need to remember to summon the wisdom not to watch it.",2,An unhealthy show to say the least.,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,6137,"['Maybe',

The first two seasons were great, and I was waiting for Dexter to team up with someone, which finally is the case in the 3rd season.It was a great season with a lot of suspense built up all the way until the final episode of the season, but then it feels extremely rushed. The climax of the story (which I won't spoil for those who haven't seen it) that took 11 episodes to build to is resolved in a matter of two minutes. Frankly it was pretty disappointing. Don't get me wrong, I am a Dexter fanatic and I can't wait to watch season 4 when it comes out, but the writers should have relished the suspense a little longer. Perhaps less Rita love story and more edge-of-your-seat action would have been better.I would have loved to give 5 stars to the third season of Dexter, but the finale was really poorly written, so I have to give it 4 stars. Despite the episode #12 flop, it's still worth it to see the whole 3rd season.

Sure, he was well-ensconced with the Miami PD as a blood spatter analyst/forensic expert.  Sure, he was dating the darling Rita (Julie Benz, confirming that her hilarious bit part in ""As Good As It Gets"" was no fluke) and had moved her ex out of the picture.  His sister, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter, a real find) was as profanely adorable as ever (or is it adorably profane?).  And he had eliminated many of his nasty problems . . . life seemed good for our sadistic hero.*** Semi-spoiler alert:  Thanks to some stellar writing, Season 3 of ""Dexter"" picks up without a hitch.  Through a botched job and a semi-tragic accident, Dexter comes into close contact with Assistant DA Miguel Prado.  At first, it seems that Dexter may have found his true friend, just in time to discover that Rita is pregnant.  If there's ever a time for Dexter to get the insight of a stable family man like Miguel, it would be now.  But as the series drags on, Dexter learns that he and Miguel may be too similar for Dexter to consider him a true friend . . . perhaps anyone Dexter is too akin to is not the kind of person he should be friends with.  Miguel's demons help take this season into some extremely dark territory.That's not to say that the show's trademark gallows humor is gone.  Detective Angel Batista (David Zayas) and forensics nut Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee) get some choice subplots, and Debra's romance with a confidential informant offers a lot of smiles.Sure, this may not be Important TV like ""The Wire"" or ""The Sopranos.""

Prior to Season 3 of Dexter, I watched the first two seasons on DVD (Season One&Season Two). I used to send all this money to my cable company for subscribing to Showtime, and Dexter was never part of my regular TV viewing until 2008. Color me stupid. What was I missing out on?...Only the absolute best show on TV.How good is it? Let's put it this way...I'm actually glad that I hadn't seen this until DVD, because my wife and I were able to watch the first two seasons in weeks versus like 3 months PER regular season on Showtime. We often watched three episodes in one night on the DVD sets. Alas, I couldn't wait for Season 3's release on DVD, so it was one episode of Dexter, one week at a time for Season 3.So certainly one of the good things about Dexter on DVD is that you don't need to wait 12 weeks to see a season from start to finish. But certainly the best thing about the series is how well done it is.Dexter (played by Michael C. Hall of HBO'sSix Feet Underfame) is a blood spatter analyst with Miami Homicide. It's his job to help solve murders, and he also happens to moonlight as a serial killer....Just a side note that last part.The acting in the show is terrific, and the thrills and twists are plentiful. Combine the nature of Dexter's professional life with his favorite pass-time, and you can bet your carotid artery that there's plenty of blood in the show too. But rest assured that the show isn't just about killing. Relationships, family, the inner working of a homicide squad...all of this ""stuff"" is also packed neatly into the Dexter series and makes the show one of the best on TV that I've seen in a long long time.The major plot involving guest star Jimmy Smits in Season 3 is a bit more of a stretch of reality than were Season's 1 & 2. But the acting, dialogue and well-written story flow kept the show right up there at the top of my list of TV's finest.Add this bloody-good show to your cart.

It gets a huge boost in the endearing (and comical) struggle that emerges as Dexter contemplates true commitment--the forever kind, to not one but two other human beings--his Madonna lover Rita, and a surprise other one (who you'll learn about when you watch). He's also struggles to TRUST, and to let himself give in to his longing for a real friend, one he can be honest with, who wont bolt from him when Dex bares his soul.On the other side--the EVIL. In this Season, Dexter is at the top of his game in murder, and also more sure of himself and of the justice of his executioner role. In fact he is so now so efficient in his evil, that some of the suspense that I felt in I and II--the holding of my breath whenever he was in the middle of a kill mission, has faded. In Season III, the guy's so good, and the risk of his bumbling and exposure so low, that I got a little complacent. Maybe this is a flaw in one sense, plot-wise in this Season. On the other hand, not to disappoint viewers, the killing stories display a long set of new skills by Dex, as he sets up more and novel clever traps, and improvises tirelessly in his damage control stunts, when bad luck threatens his missions.But as Dex becomes more sure-footed in his evil deeds, he becomes much more troubled as he tries valliantly to learn how to behave like a good guy in the growing set of ""good"" guy roles he takes on. For me, this made for a much more interesting Dex, as it presented a growing contrast between the loyal, loving, generous, child-adoring man, who's earnest and vulnerable (but very funny), as he treads in unfamiliar feminine fiefdoms (like Yoga classes for couples, led by misleadingly gentle-voiced women), and the dispassionate and less guilt-ridden killer Dexter, the one that is even more eerily calm as he garrotes and injects his prey, and forces him to face a candlelit shrine of his victims' photos, while gagged and saran-wrapped, in a final Judgment Day, before he saws, bags and dumps him. One of the best scenes has Dexter facing a nasty serial wife-killer and chuckling with him about the best ways to evade a girlfriend--golf and boats it turns out--all while getting just the right facts to send the guy off on his last jaunt at sea.So this new Dex--more good yet more ""bad"", makes this season cool and novel.  And, as many reviewers noted, the playing out of that remarkable and dark friendship with Miguel, the centerpiece of Season III--captured me...maybe even more than the Skinner guy lurking around and flaying people all Season did!

1149177,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B0015ABRE2,Spider Monkey,"[0, 0]","This third series of Dexter follows the same pattern as previous series. Whilst working in the Miami homicide department Dexter kills deserving criminals who got away with their crimes. Each episode usually has it's own story where Dexter hunts and kills his target and then there is the over-arcing series story, this time the hunt for `The Skinner', that is interwoven.In this series Dexter and Rita's relationship takes another step and Dexter also finds a new friend, but there may be more to him than meets the eye.Thankfully this is still written very well and had me second guessing and teetering on the edge of my seat the whole way through. I found the ending had slightly less impact than the previous series' did, but it was still adequate payoff for the time spent watching the DVD. Michael C Hall is as amazing as ever as Dexter and whilst the actress who plays his sister is still pretty wooden and gets annoying due to playing a loud mouthed arrogant character, at least her performance here is better than in series 1 or 2. That's the thing I've found with Dexter overall actually, the story is excellent and keeps you gripped and Michael C Hall is excellent, but the rest of the cast give changeable performances and sometimes are very believable and other times they make you cringe. If you feel the same way as me about series 1 and 2, you will see that nothing much has changed here.All in all, this is another superb Dexter series and it develops his character, the back story to his life, his relationships and the overall theme very well indeed.

Hall's acting ability this series is more than just a re-hash of the serial killer genre.  It infushes the whole character with new life similar to how Bela Lugosi infused the Dracula character with new vitality back in 1931.By rotating their supporting characters, the creators of Dexter have managed to use death as vehicle for giving their show new life each season.In season three Jimmy Smits is recruited to serve as Dexter's sometime friend/sometime foil and in so doing Smits significantly rises above his previous acting product.In the first episode we find a grieving Smits befriended by and befriending the title character Dexter.  The dark source of Smits' grief is only gradually revealed by writers who have the patience to allow their characters to disclose their secrets in their own time and in their own way.  Why the two connect and the result of that connection is a disclosure better discovered by watching the show than any review.But new Dexter viewers can be assured that if they so desire they could start with this season and then return to seasons one and two...if they so chose...because fortunately this is a show which has definately maintained its quality over time.",5,Killer!,1251072000,"08 24, 2009",2009,1278,"['serial', 'killer', 'who', 'serial', 'killers', 'what', 'concept', 'Yet', 'owing', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'acting', 'ability', 'series', 'more', 'just', 're-hash', 'serial', 'killer', 'genre', 'whole', 'character', 'new', 'life', 'similar', 'how', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'infused', 'Dracula', 'character', 'new', 'vitality', 'back', '1931.By', 'rotating', 'supporting', 'characters', 'creators', 'Dexter', 'have', 'managed', 'use', 'death', 'vehicle', 'giving', 'show', 'new', 'life', 'season.In', 'season', 'three', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'recruited', 'serve', 'Dexter', 'sometime', 'friend/sometime', 'foil', 'so', 'doing', 'Smits', 'significantly', 'previous', 'acting', 'product.In', 'first', 'episode', 'find', 'grieving', 'Smits', 'befriended', 'befriending', 'title', 'character', 'Dexter', 'dark', 'source', 'Smits', 'grief', 'only', 'gradually', 'revealed', 'writers', 'who', 'have', 'patience', 'allow', 'characters', 'disclose', 'secrets', 'own', 'time', 'own', 'way', 'Why', 'two', 'connect', 'result', 'connection', 'disclosure', 'better', 'discovered', 'watching', 'show', 'review.But', 'new', 'Dexter', 'viewers', 'can', 'be', 'assured', 'so', 'could', 'start', 'season', 'then', 'return', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'so', 'chose', 'because', 'fortunately', 'show', 'definately', 'maintained', 'quality', 'time']",Dexter: Season 3

If you were like me and only became aware of Dexter at the start of season two, you probably watched all of season one in a single sitting because there was no way you were going to sleep before finding out what happened next!Season two slowed things down a little bit in order to develop other characters.  Lila was a waste of space, but she was a good utility character used to wrap up all the loose ends in season two.  A great season, but it didn't hold a candle to season one.Season three comes along and all of a sudden we're wondering about Daddy Dexter - maybe even Mr. and Mrs. Dexter?For Dexter fans, season three is a great culmination of what's been brewing in season one and season two.  You really start to see Dexter develop as a person rather than a mindless killing machine who's barely in control of his ""Dark Passenger"".  Where control was always a central focus in the previous seasons, manipulation becomes the theme in season three as Dexter finds out the hard way that sometimes he's the puppet not the puppet master as when he tangles with Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits).Season three also starts throwing conundrums to the fans about Dexter's character.  You learn in episode one that Dexter's about to be a daddy and throughout the season you see Dexter trying to figure out if he can raise a child that doesn't turn out to be just like himself.  You also see Dexter suddenly having to tackle emotions like mercy and even odder, having to deal with the ins and outs of friendship.  While part of you cheers for Dexter Morgan growing as a person, becoming more and more socially adjusted - hoping that he'll make a great dad; another part of you really wants him to leave Rita, stay alone in his apartment, and return back to the simpler days of season one.All in all, Dexter is still one of the best shows on television and season three is no exception.

Having narrowly missed being caught in Season Two you would assume Dexter would change his ways, but right from the start of the first episode it's clear that isn't going to happen.  Dexter's first kill also sets in motion the events of Season Three.  But rather than killing based on his code, Dexter accidentally kills in self-defense.  The killing draws in powerful Assistant District Attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits) and his volatile deputy sheriff brother Ramon (played to intense perfection by Jason Manuel Olazabal).  As with seasons one and two plot twists abound against the backdrop of Dexter's impending nuptials.  Pressure mounts for Dexter to give up his freedom and his apartment.  He's now questioning the wisdom of the code his father Harry taught him.  Are his days of vengeance coming to an end?As with previous seasons the other cast members are more fully flushed out including a budding romance for Detective Batista (played with great warmth and honesty by David Zayas).  Dexter's sister Deb (the superbly foul-mouthed Jennifer Carpenter, Michael C. Hall's real life wife) is drawn to a confidential informant who may help her earn her detective's shield or blow her chances for it.  At the same time there's complications with Deb's partner Detective Quinn and an Internal Affairs agent Yuki Amado who needs Deb's help investigating Quinn.  A new serial killer, the Skinner, emerges to distract the detectives.  In a change from seasons one and two the focus shifts to the rest of this wonderful ensemble cast and away from a heavy emphasis on Dexter.  Yet the central plot remains the burgeoning relationship between Dexter and Miguel as both jockey for power and control as events unfold.  There's little surprise in the outcome of this lethal pas de duex and in that respect ""Dexter"" falls into the trap of becoming too formulaic.  But end of the Skinner and the role Dexter plays is a true ""didn't see that coming"" moment that shows the writers are still on top of their game.  Dexter manages to slip away again, untroubled and undetected.  But now that he's married what does the future hold?  After nearly being killed will Dexter give up the code and the killings?  And what will Deb do as she slowly learns more about her father's and Dexter's pasts?""Dexter"" is one of the most tautly scripted, well directed and superbly casted shows on television, and a delight to watch.  Season Three was interesting to watch for the examination of the degrees of good and evil.  Miguel's unnuanced form of vigilante justice was an interesting counterpoint Dexter's reasoned icy logic for killing that is clearly a metaphor for our own society's debate over justice and Manichean concepts of good and evil.  ""Dexter"" continues to delight in poking holes in our concepts of good and evil by getting us to root for a serial killer.

But to share your firend with your dark passenger, explainign things that stay better by darkness - that can be a problem.As far as Dexter goes, I have to say that it has remained one of my favorite shows on television. There have been so many plots that have surprised me, from the things with the Ice Truck Killer to the way that Dexter slipped the noose in Season 2, and things continue to grow from here. Now we have Dexter attempting to make sense of his life as Rita grows, thinking about what a family is and how it could fit into his world. Rita has undergone changes as well (I've foudn some of those bad, but that is totally an opinon of my own), as have so many of the characters that Dexter calls ""friends."" Of course, these firends are just cover and Dexter mixes it up with somoen that promises him more than that. The development of this story, coupled with the already great stroytelling that Dexter brings to the scrceen, is amazingly fresh. The acting is superb, too, with everyone from the sister that still feels the torment of rejection to the drinking frinds and lab partners that have storylines all their own. In many ways this sets the show apart because, unlike other series, it does not ignore the things that happen to the people around Dexter. It merges them and changes them, making waves that sometimes help and sometimes threaten.I personally give the show my highest seal of approval, noting just how fast I went throught the seasons on DVD. They are addictive things, and they are not horrific like they could be. Bloody - yes, horric - not so much. Even people in my family that can't stomach some CSI episodes watch the show with passion. As I write this I have already entered the fourth season as well, with even the newest addition to the force (one Quinn for a likeable Dokes)making this reviewer happy. Sometimes I feel like I have Dexter fever, even wanting a ""bowl till you Bleed"" team shirt.It truly makes you love it in ways you wouldn't have thought possible.",5,Pals or Hermits: The Choices one makes,1257206400,"11 3, 2009",2009,2356,"['Everyone', 'friend', 'Dexter', 'case', 'not', 'different', 'Considering', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'life', 'brother', 'Season', '1', 'Bay', 'Harbor', 'Buther', 'Season', '2', 'things', 'happened', 'Rita', 'Paul', 'Lila', 'changes', 'rita', 'characters', 'other', 'surpises', 'only', 'normal', 'want', 'someone', 'share', 'share', 'firend', 'dark', 'passenger', 'explainign', 'things', 'stay', 'better', 'darkness', 'can', 'be', 'problem.As', 'far', 'Dexter', 'have', 'say', 'remained', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'television', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'plots', 'have', 'surprised', 'things', 'Ice', 'Truck', 'Killer', 'way', 'Dexter', 'slipped', 'noose', 'Season', '2', 'things', 'continue', 'grow', 'here', 'Now', 'have', 'Dexter', 'attempting', 'make', 'sense', 'life', 'Rita', 'thinking', 'what', 'family', 'how', 'could', 'fit', 'world', 'Rita', 'undergone', 'changes', 'as', 'well', ""'ve"", 'foudn', 'bad', 'totally', 'opinon', 'own', 'as', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'Dexter', 'friends', 'course', 'firends', 'are', 'just', 'cover', 'Dexter', 'mixes', 'up', 'somoen', 'more', 'development', 'story', 'coupled', 'already', 'great', 'stroytelling', 'Dexter', 'scrceen', 'amazingly', 'fresh', 'acting', 'superb', 'too', 'everyone', 'sister', 'still', 'torment', 'rejection', 'drinking', 'frinds', 'lab', 'partners', 'have', 'storylines', 'own', 'many', 'ways', 'show', 'apart', 'other', 'series', 'not', 'ignore', 'things', 'happen', 'people', 'Dexter', 'changes', 'making', 'waves', 'sometimes', 'help', 'sometimes', 'threaten.I', 'personally', 'give', 'show', 'highest', 'seal', 'approval', 'noting', 'just', 'how', 'fast', 'went', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'are', 'addictive', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'horrific', 'could', 'be', 'Bloody', 'yes', 'horric', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Even', 'people', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'CSI', 'episodes', 'watch', 'show', 'passion', 'write', 'have', 'already', 'entered', 'fourth', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'newest', 'addition', 'force', 'one', 'Quinn', 'likeable', 'Dokes', 'making', 'reviewer', 'happy', 'Sometimes', 'feel', 'have', 'Dexter', 'fever', 'even', 'wanting', 'bowl', 'till', 'Bleed', 'team', 'shirt.It', 'truly', 'love', 'ways', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'thought', 'possible']",Dexter: Season 3
1149192,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0015ABRE2,trebe,"[0, 0]","In the second season of Dexter, our favorite serial killer Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) was mostly on the defensive, with Miami Metro Police on his tail, and off balance, bouncing between his girlfriend Rita (Julie Benz) and a woman who was an unbalanced possessive kook.  In a refreshing change, Season Three features Dexter, a police blood spatter analyst, returning to his dark ways of dispensing justice, targeting for death, those that escape punishment through the legal system.  The level of violence is elevated, as various characters have murder on their minds.  Spoilers are ahead, so proceed through the yellow warning tape at your own risk.There are a couple of major story arcs, one involves Rita's pregnancy, Dexter's marriage proposal, and the plans for their wedding.  Another concern is a multiple killer known as ""The Stripper"", so called because he removes large strips of skin from his victims.  Lt. LaGuerta's (Lauren Velez) investigative team is mobilized on this case, with Dexter's sister Debra Morgan (Carpenter) and her new partner Joey Quinn (Desmond Harrington) being the point investigators.  Newly promoted to detective, Angel Batista (David Zayas) is elevated to number two under LaGuerta.The biggest development in Season Three is Dexter's involvement with the Prado family.  First, while trying to eliminate a drug dealer named ""Freebo"", Dexter accidentally kills Oscar Prado, the brother of assistant district attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits).  Dexter eventually tracks down Freebo, but immediately after stabling him dead, and with a bloody knife in his hands, Dexter runs into Miguel.  A shocked Dexter confesses that he has sent Freebo to a better place, for which Miguel expresses his gratitude.It seems odd, but Dexter and Miguel quickly become close, and as do Rita and Miguel's wife Sylvia (Valeri Cruz).  Miguel connects the dots, and guesses that Dexter is a vigilante type killer, and expresses interest in helping him in his pursuit of ""justice"".  Eventually Miguel and a reluctant Dexter, collaborate on bold and daring kill.  On their next effort, it is Miguel who plunges the knife into the next victim.  An empowered and confident Miguel then goes solo, murdering a prominent attorney whom he has a grudge against.With an out of control partner, who knows too many of his secrets, Dexter is perhaps facing his stickiest dilemma.  Interwoven with the Prado storyline are a number of subplots, that mesh together fairly well, to produce an exciting and tension filled drama, with a number of twists and turns.  While often bordering on the edge of absurdity, the high quality of the acting performances helps to sell some of the more implausible aspects.  The cast as usual is extremely talented throughout, with longtime cast members, C.J. Lee, Zayas, and Velez all being outstanding.Jennifer Carpenter is very talented, playing the somewhat predictable and flawed Debra Morgan, a very determined cop, but not always in control, or possessing the best judgment.  While kind of a loose cannon, she does uncover several critical leads.  Debra leads with her heart, and it's usually not hard to predict who she's going to get romantically involved with.  Together with the spirit of her father Harry Morgan (James Remar), they provide the link to Dexter's past.That Julie Benz apparently had her breasts enhanced, is evident in the season's first episode.  In Season Three her character Rita, is mostly concerned with personal matters.  This was a good choice, as Dexter has plenty to deal with, and his heavy involvement with Rita and the kids in Season Two, left him little time for his deadly pursuits.Miguel Prado is a pivotal character, and also the most problematic.  An assistant district attorney willing to take the law into his own hands, who then forms a partnership with Dexter, is something that is rather hard to swallow.  Be that as it may, Jimmy Smits does a fine job of bringing some believability, to a challenging role that requires him to evolve quite a bit during the course of the season.  Smits performance is definitely crucial to the success of the third season.In the end, an unlikely partnership is dissolved, as the student learns much more about the subject of murder than he expected to.  The ending is a bit rushed, but Dexter makes the trip down the aisle in time, concluding another powerful and dramatic season.",5,"an unlikely partnership in crime, highlights a killer third season...",1284768000,"09 18, 2010",2010,4396,"['second', 'season', 'Dexter', 'favorite', 'serial', 'killer', 'Dexter', 'Morgan', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'was', 'mostly', 'defensive', 'Miami', 'Metro', 'Police', 'tail', 'balance', 'bouncing', 'girlfriend', 'Rita', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'unbalanced', 'possessive', 'kook', 'refreshing', 'change', 'Season', 'Three', 'features', 'Dexter', 'police', 'blood', 'spatter', 'analyst', 'returning', 'dark', 'ways', 'dispensing', 'justice', 'targeting', 'death', 'escape', 'punishment', 'legal', 'system', 'level', 'violence', 'elevated', 'various', 'characters', 'have', 'murder', 'minds', 'Spoilers', 'are', 'ahead', 'so', 'proceed', 'yellow', 'warning', 'tape', 'own', 'risk.There', 'are', 'couple', 'major', 'story', 'arcs', 'one', 'Rita', 'pregnancy', 'Dexter', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'plans', 'wedding', 'concern', 'multiple', 'killer', 'known', 'Stripper', 'so', 'called', 'large', 'strips', 'skin', 'victims', 'Lt.', 'LaGuerta', 'Lauren', 'Velez', 'investigative', 'team', 'mobilized', 'case', 'Dexter', 'sister', 'Debra', 'Morgan', 'Carpenter', 'new', 'partner', 'Joey', 'Quinn', 'Desmond', 'Harrington', 'being', 'point', 'investigators', 'Newly', 'promoted', 'detective', 'Angel', 'Batista', 'David', 'Zayas', 'elevated', 'number', 'two', 'LaGuerta.The', 'biggest', 'development', 'Season', 'Three', 'Dexter', 'involvement', 'Prado', 'family', 'First', 'trying', 'eliminate', 'drug', 'dealer', 'named', 'Freebo', 'Dexter', 'accidentally', 'Oscar', 'Prado', 'brother', 'assistant', 'district', 'attorney', 'Miguel', 'Prado', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'Dexter', 'eventually', 'down', 'Freebo', 'immediately', 'stabling', 'dead', 'bloody', 'knife', 'hands', 'Dexter', 'Miguel', 'A', 'shocked', 'Dexter', 'sent', 'Freebo', 'better', 'place', 'Miguel', 'gratitude.It', 'odd', 'Dexter', 'Miguel', 'quickly', 'become', 'close', 'do', 'Rita', 'Miguel', 'wife', 'Sylvia', 'Valeri', 'Cruz', 'Miguel', 'dots', 'Dexter', 'vigilante', 'type', 'killer', 'interest', 'helping', 'pursuit', 'justice', 'Eventually', 'Miguel', 'reluctant', 'Dexter', 'collaborate', 'bold', 'daring', 'kill', 'next', 'effort', 'Miguel', 'who', 'knife', 'next', 'victim', 'empowered', 'confident', 'Miguel', 'then', 'solo', 'murdering', 'prominent', 'attorney', 'whom', 'grudge', 'control', 'partner', 'who', 'too', 'many', 'secrets', 'Dexter', 'perhaps', 'facing', 'stickiest', 'dilemma', 'Interwoven', 'Prado', 'storyline', 'are', 'number', 'subplots', 'mesh', 'together', 'fairly', 'well', 'produce', 'exciting', 'tension', 'filled', 'drama', 'number', 'twists', 'turns', 'often', 'bordering', 'edge', 'absurdity', 'high', 'quality', 'acting', 'performances', 'sell', 'more', 'implausible', 'aspects', 'cast', 'usual', 'extremely', 'talented', 'longtime', 'cast', 'members', 'C.J', 'Lee', 'Zayas', 'Velez', 'being', 'outstanding.Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'very', 'talented', 'playing', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'flawed', 'Debra', 'Morgan', 'very', 'determined', 'cop', 'not', 'always', 'control', 'possessing', 'best', 'judgment', 'kind', 'loose', 'cannon', 'uncover', 'several', 'critical', 'leads', 'Debra', 'heart', 'usually', 'not', 'hard', 'predict', 'who', 'going', 'get', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Together', 'spirit', 'father', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'James', 'Remar', 'provide', 'link', 'Dexter', 'past.That', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'apparently', 'had', 'breasts', 'enhanced', 'evident', 'season', 'first', 'episode', 'Season', 'Three', 'character', 'Rita', 'mostly', 'concerned', 'personal', 'matters', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'Dexter', 'plenty', 'deal', 'heavy', 'involvement', 'Rita', 'kids', 'Season', 'Two', 'left', 'little', 'time', 'deadly', 'pursuits.Miguel', 'Prado', 'pivotal', 'character', 'also', 'most', 'problematic', 'assistant', 'district', 'attorney', 'willing', 'take', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'who', 'then', 'partnership', 'Dexter', 'something', 'rather', 'hard', 'swallow', 'Be', 'may', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'fine', 'job', 'bringing', 'believability', 'challenging', 'role', 'evolve', 'quite', 'bit', 'course', 'season', 'Smits', 'performance', 'definitely', 'crucial', 'success', 'third', 'end', 'unlikely', 'partnership', 'dissolved', 'student', 'much', 'more', 'subject', 'murder', 'expected', 'ending', 'bit', 'rushed', 'Dexter', 'trip', 'aisle', 'time', 'concluding', 'powerful', 'dramatic', 'season']",Dexter: Season 3

The results are one of Dexter's most challenging years as the only avenging serial killer out there.The third season of ""Dexter"" starts off a bit unexpectedly for our main character; Dexter accidently kills the youngest brother of the Assistant district attorney (Jimmy Smits). When Dexter ends up hunting down the RIGHT guy (who the ADA believes killed his brother)a bond is forged quite unexpectantly and with some unusual consequences later in the season.While the second season was quite good, the third proves to be the charm for ""Dexter"" settling the show back into the groove of the higher quality groove of the first season. As usual Michael C. Hall and the rest of the supporting cast are, as usual, marvelous with the writing and direction up to the same standard. As with the second season the third season of ""Dexter"" veers into uncharted territory departing from the novel that inspired the series and provided the basis for the first season of the show.Image quality for the Blu-ray looks quite good. Dialogue is always crystal clear and even the menus are good here (an improved on the amateur quality of the first season). The only complaint I have is that this isn't subtitled unless you access the subtitles for the hard of hearing menu. Most subtitles can be activated on DVD just by pushing subtitles and activating it (the same for Blu-ray). It's nice to have that option at the flick of a finger in case you're watching the show while others are asleep.The third season of ""Dexter"" continues to have surprising developments for all the characters and a couple of new characters as well. 4 1/2 stars only because one or two episodes are a bit underdeveloped and the lack of substanial extras (aside from the bonus episodes from other Showtime TV shows a great marketing tool but a cop out for fans of the show) but otherwise highly recommended.",4,The blood is the life for Dexter,1251158400,"08 25, 2009",2009,1951,"['Dexter', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'third', 'season', 'Dexter', ""n't"", 'charm', 'killer', 'results', 'are', 'one', 'Dexter', 'most', 'challenging', 'years', 'only', 'avenging', 'serial', 'killer', 'there.The', 'third', 'season', 'Dexter', 'bit', 'unexpectedly', 'main', 'character', 'Dexter', 'accidently', 'youngest', 'brother', 'Assistant', 'district', 'attorney', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'When', 'Dexter', 'up', 'hunting', 'down', 'RIGHT', 'guy', 'who', 'ADA', 'killed', 'brother', 'bond', 'forged', 'quite', 'unexpectantly', 'unusual', 'consequences', 'later', 'season.While', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'third', 'proves', 'be', 'charm', 'Dexter', 'settling', 'show', 'back', 'groove', 'higher', 'quality', 'groove', 'first', 'season', 'usual', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'usual', 'marvelous', 'writing', 'direction', 'up', 'same', 'standard', 'second', 'season', 'third', 'season', 'Dexter', 'veers', 'uncharted', 'territory', 'departing', 'novel', 'inspired', 'series', 'provided', 'basis', 'first', 'season', 'show.Image', 'quality', 'Blu-ray', 'quite', 'good', 'Dialogue', 'always', 'crystal', 'clear', 'even', 'menus', 'are', 'good', 'here', 'improved', 'amateur', 'quality', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', ""n't"", 'subtitled', 'access', 'subtitles', 'hard', 'hearing', 'menu', 'Most', 'subtitles', 'can', 'be', 'activated', 'DVD', 'just', 'pushing', 'subtitles', 'activating', 'same', 'Blu-ray', 'nice', 'have', 'option', 'flick', 'finger', 'case', ""'re"", 'watching', 'show', 'others', 'are', 'asleep.The', 'third', 'season', 'Dexter', 'have', 'surprising', 'developments', 'characters', 'couple', 'new', 'characters', 'as', 'well', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'bit', 'underdeveloped', 'lack', 'substanial', 'extras', 'aside', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'other', 'Showtime', 'TV', 'great', 'marketing', 'tool', 'cop', 'out', 'fans', 'show', 'otherwise', 'highly', 'recommended']",Dexter: Season 3

In order to avoid suspicion as the ""quiet loner"", Dexter pretended to be an Average Joe and forced himself to maintain a girlfriend, take an interest in the lives of his co-workers and join a bowling league.  His fans have known, however, he'd rather be home researching his next project.That aspect of Dexter's life changes in Season Three of television`s greatest drama.  In addition to deepening feelings for Rita and circumstances that lead him to thoughts of being a husband to her and a father to her children, Dexter develops his first true friendship with Assistant District Attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits in the kind of role he was born to play).  Through their connections to a case, Dexter and Miguel slowly begin to see the darkness common in each other, leading Dexter to thoughts of adding a sidekick for his Dark Avenger alter ego.Fans of the sociopath on display in the early episodes of the series may find faults with the humanizing of Dexter in Season Three.  Topics can arise in discussions about the show as to whether the sociopath Dexter is slowly being cured (something that is supposed to be impossible) or whether he has never truly been a sociopath at all, just someone who thinks he is and thus behaves as such.Season Three is a worthy addition to the Dexter library, a series that explores new aspects of his personality, while remembering to address the core concerns of his relationship with his sister, his memories of his father and his nocturnal practice of cleaning up the streets of Miami.

For me, the first two seasons hung just barely around a 4-star rating. Hall is fantastic, but one person doesn't constitute a series. Sorry to see a star dribble away throughout Season 3.  Though bolstered by an ingenious role for Jimmy Smits (as DA Miguel Prado) and complemented by the always engrossing David Zayas (Det. Angel Batista), it all was so very beige.Maybe it's the ADHD kicking in, but the scarce plot threads seem so slim and one-dimensional, the lives of the characters as plain as a family sitcom.  The intrigues have not so much depth to begin with -- they then go on throughout episodes until ending in more of a fadeout than a bang.My big hope was for Dexter to do away with clingy lackluster Rita.  That not only would have made for a great episode, but would open the door for someone to be written into the show who had maybe something a little raw or edgy or brainy.  Well, that's not the way wind blew.No big hopes left for Season 4.  It would be nice if it doesn't end up some serial-killer-flavored redux of ""Little House on the Prairie"".",3,Maybe it's the ADHD kicking in ...,1255219200,"10 11, 2009",2009,1255,"['Given', 'caveat', 'whole', 'Dexter', 'life', 'story', 'being', 'absurdly', 'unbelievable', 'was', 'still', 'easy', 'hunker', 'down', 'once', 'again', 'watch', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'play', 'wonderfully', 'nuanced', 'character', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'hung', 'just', 'barely', '4-star', 'rating', 'Hall', 'fantastic', 'one', 'person', ""n't"", 'constitute', 'series', 'Sorry', 'see', 'star', 'dribble', 'away', 'Season', '3', 'bolstered', 'ingenious', 'role', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'DA', 'Miguel', 'Prado', 'complemented', 'always', 'engrossing', 'David', 'Zayas', 'Det', 'Angel', 'Batista', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'ADHD', 'kicking', 'scarce', 'plot', 'threads', 'seem', 'so', 'slim', 'one-dimensional', 'lives', 'characters', 'as', 'plain', 'family', 'sitcom', 'intrigues', 'have', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'begin', 'then', 'go', 'episodes', 'ending', 'more', 'fadeout', 'bang.My', 'big', 'hope', 'was', 'Dexter', 'do', 'away', 'clingy', 'lackluster', 'Rita', 'not', 'only', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'episode', 'would', 'open', 'door', 'someone', 'be', 'written', 'show', 'who', 'had', 'maybe', 'something', 'little', 'raw', 'edgy', 'brainy', 'Well', 'not', 'way', 'blew.No', 'big', 'hopes', 'left', 'Season', '4', 'would', 'be', 'nice', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'serial-killer-flavored', 'redux', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie']",Dexter: Season 3
