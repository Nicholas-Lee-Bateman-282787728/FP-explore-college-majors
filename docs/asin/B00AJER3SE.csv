The red and blue Tech Noir encounter still looks less than stellar, but new detail can be found everywhere in the film, and the print is pristine.

This is the highest video quality you are going to see on bluray. A 36Mbps transfer of an older grainy film and damn does it look wonderful. The AWFUL red push of the old releases is gone and THANK THE HEAVENS. This film looks unbelievable and I am NOT easy to please when it comes to details and bitrates. Most blurays these days cannot seem to get past 25Mbps, many are much less, and it shows with fluctuating quality throughout the film. Not this one.They slightly changed the color timing to reflect a modern and SLIGHTLY cooler tone. Some people cannot seem to deal with the fact we are no longer in the 80s and no director worth their salt wants that pinkish/reddish look, that was quite common in that time, to their films now that they have a choice. Blade Runner did the same and The Final Cut looks better than it ever did, though, that release has less than HALF the bitrate of this release. Anyway, the timing does wonders for this film IMO. I have never seen this so detailed in all my life. I really think the new timing gives it a more timeless look and will be appreciated by most people. In no way will it hardly even be noticed for the vast majority. Skintones remain natural and whites are still nice and bright.As for the sound, it is also the most balanced and proper it has sounded in a long time. There are these few diehard weirdos who cannot seem to deal with the fact that most people don't like mono and don't want to listen to mono in film when there are effects taking place all over the soundstage that take advantage of more than one speaker. Cameron never meant for there to be a Mono track it is just that the producers would not let him have his 4 track stereo because they were cheap bastards. He even came in under budget ffs. Mono also has many other deficiencies compared to stereo with depth of the various instruments and sounds and the overall balance of the mix. You can read about that somewhere else.I do agree they should have at least included it but quite honestly I would not be using it anyway. They seem to have improved the stereo and multi-channel tracks. To my ears the gun sounds are fine and sound pretty damn good for an 80s film. They redid some of the effects with T2 ones to my knowledge a while back. This presentation seems more balanced than any other releases to my ears.For the people that are boycotting this release let them. This isn't some travesty like the original Patton release or the Predator: Ultimate Edition release which were DNR'd to within an inch of their life and looked like wax on screen. To the contrary, this is one of the best looking blurays on the market. The old Terminator release is a joke compared to this.Nothing to be afraid of with this one. They did just about everything right except include the old mono track. And no one but a few really care because it ain't that great to begin with. 5 stars for a great remaster and at 10 bucks at Walmart, and around that on Amazon, you really cannot go wrong.

1612333,A2YQ5O6XV23543,B00AJER3SE,Kevin H. Dudley,"[3, 4]","The 1984 sci-fi/action classic ""The Terminator"" is one of the greatest and most influential films of all time. It's one of my top ten favorite films ever made and seems to only get better with age. So with that being said, the main purpose of my review is to talk about the new remastered blu-ray that was released on February 19th, 2013 and how it compares to the original blu-ray release from 2006.To be quick and to the point, this new blu-ray release blows the old disc out of the water. (This appears to be the same transfer that has been out for a little wile in Europe). Detail is greatly improved in addition to far superior contrast and black levels which is very important due to how much of the movie takes place at night. It was apparent with the 2006 blu-ray that the old ancient HD master used for the special edition DVD was dumped onto blu-ray which is what a ton of companies were doing at the beginning of the blu-ray era. There is a nice layer of film grain present that gives everything a nice feel with no evidence of digital noise reduction being applied. The old blu-ray barely looked better than an upconverted DVD and this new blu-ray FINALLY presents the film in the best quality that it's ever been for the home market. It's also on a dual layer disc this time with a very high bit rate in the mid to upper 30's throughout.There has been some grumbling on the internet of some fans questioning the transfer's more teal/bluish color scheme in comparison to past releases. Anybody who is fan of writer & director James Cameron knows that he really likes bathing his nighttime scenes in blue hues. I did a direct comparison with the old blu-ray and the new one appears much more natural in terms of skin tones and the overall color textures. The picture quality on then new blu-ray is just so beautiful and a massive improvement over the old disc, I really don't see how anybody who loves the film as much as I do would have any complaints.On the audio side, we get a lossless DTS surround mix that originally appeared on the old special edition DVD. This particular mix has been a point of contention with a lot of fans over the years. This is due to that the original audio for the film was in mono and for the surround remix, certain sound effects like gunshots were replaced. The old DVD featured both the original mono track and the 5.1 remix. The first blu-ray onl contained the surround remix. For this new blu-ray, I've always felt that the original audio track should be presented if a remix was done. With that being said, I don't mind the new gun shot sounds in the surround remix but would like to have had the mono track in lossless audio too.Extras are the same as the first blu-ray in which we get a 13 minute featurette on the visual effects & music, a fun 20 minute sit down conversation with James Cameron & Arnold Schwarzenegger reminiscing about the film and some deleted scenes. Still missing in action from the special edition DVD are the optional James Cameron commentary on the deleted scenes explaining why they were cut out as welll as the remained of the hour long making of doumentary that the visual effects piece was pulled from. Since this new blu-ray is on a dual layered 50 gigabyte disc, it's not an issue of space since those extras are all in standard definition to begin with. No trailers for the film are present either which is disappointing from a completist point of view.So, sadly we still have yet to get the true definitive blu-ray of The Terminator with those mentioned extras not being included along with the original mono audio track. But all fans owe it to themselves to get this new blu-ray due to the massive upgrade in picture quality.

1612341,A284P8XSG9HREA,B00AJER3SE,M. Ram,"[2, 2]","The Terminator meshed elements of science fiction, horror and action like few movies before or since. James Cameron worked with a relatively low budget and made a masterpiece that's still watchable today - many of the concepts (such as military equipment becoming automated) are already starting to happen, and the message of becoming too dependent on technology could be even more relevant today than in 1984.Unlike Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the first movie has only been released a few times in the past, including once before on Blu-Ray (around 2006). I thought the previous release looked fine, but this &#34;remastered&#34; edition is superior, with a much sharper and richer picture overall. I was worried when I read about Cameron's requested color re-timing (apparently they tinted certain scenes to look more blue in this release), but it's barely noticeable and fits the scenes where it's used (mainly in the blue walls of the parking garages, the police station, and the concrete barrier Kyle and Sarah hide in after escaping from the station). I watched T2 right after this and was impressed at how much more consistent they looked together (T2 was shot with a lot of blue-hued scenes originally).Having said that, this release has its own problems ; sometimes one scene will be totally clear while the next will have a lot of grain; at least once or twice, certain scenes looked to have too much DNR applied (where the whole screen looked smeared and lost detail). Also, I wished they fixed the parts of the image where rear-projection was used, as those shots still look really out of place (they could have just darkened those parts to match the rest of the action but chose to leave them alone instead). I guess there's only so much they would do though, as the movie is almost 30 years old and the only alternative in places would be to use CGI to replace things (which I'm glad they didn't do!).The audio doesn't include the original sound mix, but the one that is here is very nice, with great effects during the gun battles and car crashes. The score still sounds great, too.Overall, I'm happy with the upgrade; a commentary with Cameron (and maybe some of the stars, model makers, etc) would have been nice, but there is a nice retrospective and interesting deleted scenes on the disc. Recommended (along with the Skynet edition of T2).",5,"Inconsistent remastering, but the best this movie has ever looked.",1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,2359,"['Terminator', 'meshed', 'elements', 'science', 'fiction', 'horror', 'action', 'few', 'movies', 'James', 'Cameron', 'worked', 'relatively', 'low', 'budget', 'made', 'masterpiece', 'still', 'watchable', 'today', 'many', 'concepts', 'such', 'military', 'equipment', 'becoming', 'automated', 'are', 'already', 'starting', 'happen', 'message', 'becoming', 'too', 'dependent', 'technology', 'could', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'relevant', 'today', '1984.Unlike', 'Terminator', '2', 'Judgment', 'Day', 'first', 'movie', 'only', 'been', 'released', 'few', 'times', 'past', 'including', 'once', 'before', 'Blu-Ray', '2006', 'thought', 'previous', 'release', 'looked', 'fine', '34', 'remastered', '34', 'edition', 'superior', 'much', 'sharper', 'richer', 'picture', 'overall', 'was', 'worried', 'when', 'read', 'Cameron', 'requested', 'color', 're-timing', 'apparently', 'tinted', 'certain', 'scenes', 'look', 'more', 'blue', 'release', 'barely', 'noticeable', 'scenes', 'where', 'used', 'mainly', 'blue', 'walls', 'parking', 'garages', 'police', 'station', 'concrete', 'barrier', 'Kyle', 'Sarah', 'hide', 'escaping', 'station', 'watched', 'T2', 'right', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'consistent', 'looked', 'together', 'T2', 'was', 'shot', 'lot', 'blue-hued', 'scenes', 'originally', '.Having', 'said', 'release', 'own', 'problems', 'sometimes', 'one', 'scene', 'will', 'be', 'totally', 'clear', 'next', 'will', 'have', 'lot', 'grain', 'least', 'once', 'twice', 'certain', 'scenes', 'looked', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'DNR', 'applied', 'where', 'whole', 'screen', 'looked', 'smeared', 'lost', 'detail', 'Also', 'wished', 'fixed', 'parts', 'image', 'where', 'rear-projection', 'was', 'used', 'shots', 'still', 'look', 'really', 'place', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'darkened', 'parts', 'match', 'rest', 'action', 'chose', 'leave', 'alone', 'instead', 'guess', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'do', 'though', 'movie', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'old', 'only', 'alternative', 'places', 'would', 'be', 'use', 'CGI', 'replace', 'things', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', '.The', 'audio', ""n't"", 'include', 'original', 'sound', 'mix', 'one', 'here', 'very', 'nice', 'great', 'effects', 'gun', 'battles', 'car', 'crashes', 'score', 'still', 'great', 'too.Overall', ""'m"", 'happy', 'upgrade', 'commentary', 'Cameron', 'maybe', 'stars', 'model', 'makers', 'etc', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'nice', 'retrospective', 'interesting', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'disc', 'Recommended', 'Skynet', 'edition', 'T2']",N/A

I knew this because the last known re-issue of ""The Terminator"" on DVD had many extras. Like additional documentaries and the making of the film, etc.. The first issued Blu-Ray of the film actually looked no better than the DVD (it appears to be the same unimproved source copy) but however, it also excluded all that extra material that the last known DVD version had so you will be more anxious to buy the film again, later, that will include all those already existing extras.I believe this was their plan to double dip the consumer to resell this movie again, on Blu-Ray.You gotta ask yourself. ""How many times have I bought this same movie over the years, with the promise of it being somewhat more improved?"" (your purchases of the past included VHS in several re-issues, Beta, Laserdisc, DVD again in several re-issues, BD, etc.) The Blu-Ray has been issued twice already, and now, here comes the third re-issue on Blu-Ray.It's ridiculous how they do this to us. They give as little as they can on the first release, and then they improve on it just a little more, with a hope to re-sell it again.

1612355,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B00AJER3SE,Steve Douglas,"[6, 7]","Having read some of the reviews here, this one might be a touch redundant.  I do not provide plot summaries and opinions about acting etc in any of my reviews but just write about the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray.  I had bought The Terminator on Blu Ray a day before the remastered version's release was announced and immediately returned the Blu Ray to the store and waited till the remastered version came out.The video transfer is certainly a big improvement over the original Standard Def release.  The video on this remastered version retains some of the original film grain from the film but nothing that is terribly noticeable unless you pause on an image.  There are no crawling ants in the grain or any artifacting to distract you.  The original film, which I saw in the theater when it was first released became a classic and deservedly so.  That said, some of the effects are very obvious, for example, when Arnold is looking in the mirror and working on his eye it is easy to tell that that is more animation than a real Arnold that we are looking at.  Technology has greatly improved since then so we just have to take obvious effects as the groundbreaking events they were at the time of their making.  Never the less,  the film looks great and, Yes, the color grading is considerably cooler than in previous releases.  Whether or not this is a good thing or not is not for me to judge.  After having seen the film so many times over the years, it was very noticeable to me but that doesn't make it better or worse.  That opinion is up to the individual viewer.The Audio is DTS MA 5.1 and it, as well as the subtitles, are supplied in several different languages.  The lossless and remixed audio, to me, is the star of this version as the editors went to town making sure that proper audio steering to a surround system was realistically done.  There is excellent use of both the front and rear sound stages with discreet channeling throughout the movie of various foley fx.  Your LFE sub channel will also get a decent workout as the bottom end is pretty deep at times.  The audio levels are properly set so that there is no need to roller coaster your remotes volume levels between action and dialogue shots.  Yes, there is no original mono mix for anyone who prefers that, but I do prefer this lossy surround mix myself. For me, this mix makes the audio DEMO worthy to show off your home theater's surround processor.The extras consisted of several 'Terminated Scenes' that may or may not have contributed to an extended version but there was nothing there that jumped out at me saying ""put me back in"".  There was also a pretty old Retrospective of the Terminator consisting of a discussion between Arnold and James Cameron.  I really didn't think too much of it but there were some interesting points made by both.  I did not know that Arnold was originally to be the hero of the film as Michael Beine eventually became.Personally, since I never saw the original blu ray release I cannot say whether, if you already have it on blu ray you should upgrade to the remastered version.  However, if you only have it on Standard Def, then I do think this is a very worthy upgrade.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase.Thanks",5,The Terminator Remastered Blu Ray,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,3286,"['Having', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'touch', 'redundant', 'do', 'not', 'provide', 'plot', 'summaries', 'opinions', 'acting', 'etc', 'reviews', 'just', 'write', 'quality', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'had', 'bought', 'Terminator', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'day', 'remastered', 'version', 'release', 'was', 'announced', 'immediately', 'returned', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'store', 'waited', 'remastered', 'version', 'came', 'out.The', 'video', 'transfer', 'certainly', 'big', 'improvement', 'original', 'Standard', 'Def', 'release', 'video', 'remastered', 'version', 'original', 'film', 'grain', 'film', 'nothing', 'terribly', 'noticeable', 'pause', 'image', 'are', 'crawling', 'ants', 'grain', 'artifacting', 'distract', 'original', 'film', 'saw', 'theater', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'became', 'classic', 'deservedly', 'so', 'said', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'obvious', 'example', 'when', 'Arnold', 'looking', 'mirror', 'working', 'eye', 'easy', 'tell', 'more', 'animation', 'real', 'Arnold', 'are', 'looking', 'Technology', 'greatly', 'improved', 'then', 'just', 'have', 'take', 'obvious', 'effects', 'groundbreaking', 'events', 'were', 'time', 'making', 'Never', 'less', 'film', 'great', 'Yes', 'color', 'grading', 'considerably', 'cooler', 'previous', 'releases', 'Whether', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'not', 'not', 'judge', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'years', 'was', 'very', 'noticeable', ""n't"", 'make', 'better', 'worse', 'opinion', 'individual', 'viewer.The', 'Audio', 'DTS', 'MA', '5.1', 'as', 'well', 'subtitles', 'are', 'supplied', 'several', 'different', 'languages', 'lossless', 'remixed', 'audio', 'star', 'version', 'editors', 'went', 'town', 'making', 'sure', 'proper', 'audio', 'steering', 'surround', 'system', 'was', 'realistically', 'done', 'excellent', 'use', 'front', 'rear', 'sound', 'stages', 'discreet', 'channeling', 'movie', 'various', 'foley', 'fx', 'LFE', 'sub', 'channel', 'will', 'also', 'get', 'decent', 'workout', 'bottom', 'end', 'pretty', 'deep', 'times', 'audio', 'levels', 'are', 'properly', 'set', 'so', 'need', 'roller', 'coaster', 'remotes', 'volume', 'levels', 'action', 'dialogue', 'shots', 'Yes', 'original', 'mono', 'mix', 'anyone', 'who', 'do', 'prefer', 'lossy', 'surround', 'mix', 'mix', 'audio', 'DEMO', 'worthy', 'show', 'off', 'home', 'theater', 'surround', 'processor.The', 'extras', 'consisted', 'several', ""'Terminated"", 'Scenes', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'contributed', 'extended', 'version', 'was', 'nothing', 'there', 'jumped', 'out', 'saying', 'put', 'back', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'old', 'Retrospective', 'Terminator', 'consisting', 'discussion', 'Arnold', 'James', 'Cameron', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'much', 'were', 'interesting', 'points', 'made', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'Arnold', 'was', 'originally', 'be', 'hero', 'film', 'Michael', 'Beine', 'eventually', 'became.Personally', 'never', 'saw', 'original', 'blu', 'ray', 'release', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'already', 'have', 'blu', 'ray', 'should', 'upgrade', 'remastered', 'version', 'However', 'only', 'have', 'Standard', 'Def', 'then', 'do', 'think', 'very', 'worthy', 'upgrade.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase.Thanks']",N/A

And, man am I happy I did.This review is on the Remastered 2013 vs the original 2006 BluRay:I never complained about the old version because it was so much better than the DVD and, being a 20yo, low budget movie, I didn't think it could get much better.  Well, it does. I just finished watching the Remastered version, followed by the old one; I can see major flaws after viewing the newer release. The 2006 copy is softer, flatter, has plenty of flecks of dirt throughout, and highlights tend to be blown out. All of this has finally been fixed.The sound is pretty much the same, which is clear and active, but with some of the surround elements a bit louder than I think fits. I spent a lot of time turning up the sound when normal talking occurred, and turning it back down when the chase scenes or flashbacks happen as the switches make my wife jump. Neither movie has a mono track included. I don't mind, but some have complained.Bonus features are exactly the same (and in SD), so don't expect anything new.The one change I didn't like was that now there's no main menu screen. The movie starts immediately and you have to use the pop-up menu to bring up choices (the older version went to a menu screen first). This is OK for the most part, but when playing features, it goes right back to the movie as soon as that bonus feature is done playing. It's not a deal breaker, but it does bother me.Personal opinion: If you have an average TV & the old BluRay, this is probably not worth an upgrade, as you may not see much of a difference. If you have a high quality big screen, you might want to get it because you should see a big improvement in clarity. Both are better than the DVD, but the new one is head and shoulders above it. Don't upgrade for sound as the 2006 release sounds great & the 2013 isn't any different.Hope this review helps.",5,Way better than the last BluRay!,1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,1953,"['do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'buy', 'BluRay', 'replace', 'BluRay', 'same', 'movie', 'time', 'made', 'exception', 'man', 'am', 'happy', 'did.This', 'review', 'Remastered', '2013', 'original', '2006', 'BluRay', 'never', 'complained', 'old', 'version', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'being', '20yo', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'get', 'much', 'better', 'Well', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Remastered', 'version', 'followed', 'old', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'major', 'flaws', 'viewing', 'newer', 'release', '2006', 'copy', 'softer', 'flatter', 'plenty', 'flecks', 'dirt', 'highlights', 'tend', 'be', 'blown', 'out', 'finally', 'been', 'fixed.The', 'sound', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'clear', 'active', 'surround', 'bit', 'louder', 'think', 'fits', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'turning', 'up', 'sound', 'when', 'normal', 'talking', 'occurred', 'turning', 'back', 'down', 'when', 'chase', 'scenes', 'flashbacks', 'happen', 'switches', 'make', 'wife', 'jump', 'movie', 'mono', 'track', 'included', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'have', 'complained.Bonus', 'features', 'are', 'exactly', 'same', 'SD', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'new.The', 'one', 'change', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'now', 'main', 'menu', 'screen', 'movie', 'immediately', 'have', 'use', 'pop-up', 'menu', 'bring', 'up', 'choices', 'older', 'version', 'went', 'menu', 'screen', 'first', 'OK', 'most', 'part', 'when', 'playing', 'features', 'right', 'back', 'movie', 'as', 'soon', 'bonus', 'feature', 'done', 'playing', 'not', 'deal', 'breaker', 'bother', 'me.Personal', 'opinion', 'have', 'average', 'TV', 'old', 'BluRay', 'probably', 'not', 'upgrade', 'may', 'not', 'see', 'much', 'difference', 'have', 'high', 'quality', 'big', 'screen', 'might', 'want', 'get', 'should', 'see', 'big', 'improvement', 'clarity', 'are', 'better', 'DVD', 'new', 'one', 'head', 'shoulders', 'Do', ""n't"", 'upgrade', 'sound', '2006', 'release', 'great', '2013', ""n't"", 'different.Hope', 'review']",N/A
