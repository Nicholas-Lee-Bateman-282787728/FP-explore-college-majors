1121900,A1FNW6H983I87V,B000ZDQI44,"Loves To Read ""Lu""","[3, 4]","STORY - This History Channel documentary with Tom Brokaw as host highlights the most turbulent year of, arguably, the most turbulent decade in our country's history. It is hard to dispute the statement that America changed dramatically during the sixties and 1968 seemed to be the year that everything changed. There were two major assassinations, a riot at the Democratic convention, violent protests on college campuses, and a very contentious presidential campaign with the sitting president, Lyndon Johnson, opting not to run again. Drug use was rampant among the 'hippie' generation. But there was also the 'silent majority' who continued to pursue their version of the American way. These views clashed in often violent ways stretching the ability of law enforcement to contain them at times. Not to mention the race issue inflamed by the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr. Did I mention feminism and the rise of the women's liberation movement? And for good measure add a resurrected politician named Richard Nixon into the mix. It was fitting that the year should culminate in one of the greatest achievements of mankind, the Apollo 8 Space Mission to the moon. 1968 is not just a year in the past, it is an experience that still influences society today among those who experienced it and those influenced by them. If you missed the sixties, this is a good place to start in understanding what happened. Plenty of good archival footage from actual events. The low ratings of some people seem to have more to do with what's missing than what's included. Unfortunately a 90 minute documentary about 1968 will inevitably leave out some important events or different perspectives.

1121901,A3OH36BA3YSN7M,B000ZDQI44,timcon1964,"[0, 0]","In some of his recent books, especially ""Boom: Talking About the Sixties"" (2008), and ""The Times of Our Lives"" (2011), Tom Brokaw has combined his own personal reminiscences with the remarks of interviewees in an attempt to learn how the past might explain America's current problems and perhaps guide the way to a better future.In ""1968 With Tom Brokaw,"" he applies this formula to this ""pivotal"" year, contending that, ""The people who lived through that time have stories to tell that help us understand the country we are today.""  ""1968"" alludes briefly to sports, music, and films, but its emphasis is primarily on military, social, and political developments, taken more or less in chronological order:  The Tet offensive, the hippie movement, race relations, women's liberation, the McCarthy and Kennedy primary campaigns, the political conventions, the Humphrey-Nixon campaign, and a hopeful account of Apollo 8's trip to the moon.""1968"" draws on contemporary newsreels, Brokaw's personal recollections, and the contributions of a large group of commentators.  The original images from 1968 are the strongest part of this documentary.  For older viewers, they will bring back memories; for younger viewers, they will convey an idea of what went on in this troubled year.  Brokaw's personal experiences are less compelling than those of his commentators, among whom are such political operatives as Sam Brown, Pat Buchanan, Jeff Greenfield, and Rafer Johnson; and activists Mark Rudd, Cleveland Sellers, and Andrew Young.  For some reason, Brokaw seems to think that musicians have special insights on this year--among the commentators are Arlo Guthrie, Michelle Phillips, Bruce Springsteen, and James Taylor.  But, apart from historian Alan Brinkley, the commentators do not include any serious scholars--the historians, political scientists, sociologists, and psychologists who could have shed meaningful light on 1968.Some reviewers have charged that Brokaw is attempting to promote a ""liberal"" agenda.  In fact, on most issues he attempts to take a middle position.  For opinions about the Vietnam War, he interviews a draft evader and a Vietnam veteran; he discusses the demonstrations at the Democratic convention in Chicago with a demonstrator and a Chicago policeman.  He mentions that he visited Haight-Ashbury in its heyday as the symbolic crossroads of the ""drug culture,"" but explains that he did so wearing a suit and tie.  After a friend was killed in Vietnam, Brokaw wanted to curse ""this damned war""; but the friend's family's ""mixed feelings of pride and bewilderment"" moderated Brokaw's emotions.  And, when covering the McCarthy-Kennedy primary contest in California, Brokaw tells us that he had friends in both campaigns.  If Brokaw had been making a ""liberal"" assessment of 1968, he would not have included the views of a Chicago policeman; and he would have included coverage of the My Lai massacre and Richard Nixon's surreptitious undermining of the Johnson administration's peace talks.  And the commentators would have included Bill Moyers rather than Dorothy Rabinowitz, at least one leftist historian, and a civil rights leader more militant than Andrew Young.  No, this is not a piece of left-wing propaganda.  If Brokaw can be criticized for anything, it is not for taking a ""liberal"" position, but for his reluctance to take any position.  But his objective was not to promote any agenda, but to bring all sides together.Paradoxically, reliance on motion picture evidence can either strengthen or weaken a documentary.  Demonstrations and riots provide compelling images.  But (at least in 1968) most history took place off camera.  Those demonstrating or rioting were always a minority.  There was more to the anti-war movement than student demonstrations, more to African American aspirations than Stokely Carmichael shouting, ""Black Power,"" and more to women's liberation than a few protestors tossing high heeled shoes and brassieres into Atlantic City trash cans.  But, in general, ""1968"" does not go much deeper than the pictorial evidence.And one gets the feeling that reliance on newsreel footage not only influenced what stories ""1968"" covers, but also impacted how the commentators' remarks are presented.  To the extent that their statements were elicited by Brokaw's leading questions, or edited to address issues raised by newsreels, what we hear in this documentary may not adequately reflect their views.  For example, ""1968"" presents Rabinowitz's opinion that the anti-Miss America feminist demonstrators ""make fools of what should have been a sober and serious enterprise.""  These comments suggest that she has different thoughts about the ""sober and serious"" women's movement; but we are not told what those thoughts are.  Similarly, her conclusion that the young people of 1968 were ""an incredibly spoiled, self indulgent generation"" seems to be in response to films of demonstrators and hippies, although most young people were neither demonstrators nor hippies.Pat Buchanan appears among the commentators as a representative of Nixon's campaign. But, ""1968"" does not present his thoughts on Nixon; instead we hear Buchanan gloating about the Democrats' discomfiture after the demonstrations at the Chicago convention.  Brokaw's own remarks also seem to blame the Democrats' problems on these demonstrations.  In fact, because of Vietnam, the Democrats were in trouble well before the convention.  After all, Johnson had already chosen to drop out of the presidential race.  And, although Buchanan and Brokaw imply that anti-war  demonstrations drove a conservative pro-war backlash, opposition to the war continued after the convention--and was greater among older Americans than among younger ones.  In 1968, Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford concluded that the war in Vietnam was a ""loser.""  Henry Kissinger later wrote that the cost of the war ""was out of proportion to any conceivable gain.""  All the major 1968 presidential candidates at least paid lip service to ending the war.""1968"" does not present any alternative to Buchanan's view that student demonstrations drove conservative Democrats into the Republican party.  Perhaps more to the point is the comment Lyndon Johnson made after signing the Civil Rights bill into law:  ""I think we just delivered the South to the Republican party for a long time to come.""  Buchanan notes that the Republicans won five of the next six presidential elections (1968-1988).  Of course, the Democrats won the popular vote in five of the following six elections (1992-2012).  What do these election results actually tell us?  ""1968"" notes the changing political landscape, but does not adequately discuss what caused the changes.Another ""1968"" commentator, historian Alan Brinkley, concluded that Americans (in 2008, when ""1968"" was being produced) were ""much more conservative"" than they were in 1968.  But with what confidence can we make such a generalization?  The ""center"" of the political spectrum has moved.  Many things once considered out of the mainstream are now accepted, for example, suffrage for women and African-Americans, the income tax, Social Security, and Medicare.  Thus, today's ""moderate"" accepts policies that were formerly thought beyond the pale.  Does the current quiescence reflect a moderation of public opinion?  Can we assume that there would be no demonstrations if black Americans were again denied the vote and relegated to the back of the bus, and if 15,000 draftees were dying each year in a Middle Eastern war?  In the years since Brinkley was interviewed for ""1968,"" some states have legalized marijuana for medicinal (and even recreational) use; several jurisdictions have recognized same-sex marriage; and the country has elected, and re-elected, an African-American president.  Moreover, a recent Pew survey of 18-to-29-year-old Americans found that 49% of them had a favorable view of socialism, while only 43 % had a negative view of it.  Are these developments, which scarcely seemed possible in 1968, consistent with a ""much more conservative"" political outlook?Similarly, Brinkley implies that ""excesses on the left"" made the country more conservative.  Brokaw seems to endorse this conclusion with his comment that campus radicals ""simply infuriated many Americans.""  Of course, there have also been excesses on the right--Little Rock, Anniston, Montgomery, the University of Mississippi, Birmingham, and Selma, to mention a few that come readily to mind.  Did the left's 1960s excesses have a greater impact on the political landscape than those of the right?  If so, why were Americans less concerned about right-wing excesses?  (Incidentally, having implicitly blamed campus radicals for the ""culture wars"" that have divided America, Brokaw goes on to say, ""still the Counter Culture was rapidly becoming the popular culture.""  Another example of his balancing act.)The foregoing remarks do not necessarily reflect a disagreement with Professor Brinkley.  They are simply a plea for a more nuanced assessment of these issues (which Brinkley may well have provided in comments excluded from this documentary).  If the conventional wisdom is correct that America's political outlook was liberal in the Progressive Era, conservative in the 1920s, liberal in the 1930s, conservative in the 1950s, liberal in the 1960s, then conservative again in the 1980s, etc., the historian's role is to explain what accounts for these alterations in philosophy.Buchanan characterizes 1968 as perhaps the worst, most divisive, year in American history.  He believed the 1960s marked the beginning of the ""cultural war"" that has subsequently divided the country, ""and which I think we will never overcome, because our disagreements are so deep and profound.""  Of course, 1968 was not our most divisive year (think of 1861).  And America throughout its history has been divided along various lines--Native Americans vs. colonists, free states vs. slave states, Protestant vs. Catholic, native vs. immigrant, and black vs. white--and these divisions have occasionally produced violent reactions.  It does not seem that divisions in the last three decades of the 20th century were more significant than previous ones.  Buchanan's remarks, like those of several other commentators, imply that the moving images on the screen were the whole story.  Brokaw's editing of their remarks may have exacerbated this tendency, which is the main weakness of ""1968.""  On the other hand, it must be said that Rafer Johnson and some other commentators make very significant contributions to this program.The strength of ""1968"" lies in the newsreel footage itself.  Many, perhaps most, Americans got their news from television coverage.  Their conception of reality came from what they witnessed on the evening news.  The same images could inspire vastly different reactions in different viewers--but these were the images they saw.  ""1968"" is a little weak on interpretation; but it supplies the raw material for a study of how Americans understood their country.",4,"Evocative Images from 1968, But Weak on

They took about 5 events of significance and revisited them continually throughout the film.We know there was civil unrest...we know that the  Vietnam War was raging but cover them and move on to other developements.This is very much about the politics of this year and not much else. They say History is a dry subject. This DVD does not do much to dispel that theory. History is not only about events it is about people and there was little or no attempt to cover the  people that made this such an interesting year. I remember Jackie married Onassis and there was nothing else on the front of newspapers for 5 days...didn't even rate a subliminal blip on this interviewers radar....USS Pueblo captured by the North Koreans..(could have been mentioned I may have been fast forwarding though the student riots)...wasn't 'Laugh In the most outrageous programmme on the TV that year...only mentioned because Richard Nixon appeared briefly on it.There was a draw for the first time for Best Actress at the Oscars...not covered.The Graduate....Here to you Mrs Robinson....music was only mentioned it it was related to the protest Brokaw was covering..The novel Myra Breckinridge was published..there are so many other areas that could have rounded out this documentary.Limited only to the American experience it does not cover  the rioting in France or the Czech revolt.A very sober and limited view...he must be a riot at a dinner party,2,A limited view of 1968,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,1550,"['person', 'who', 'lived', '1968', 'was', 'disappointed', 'limited', 'vision', 'Tom', 'Brokaw', 'documentary', 'maker', 'took', 'about', '5', 'events', 'significance', 'revisited', 'continually', 'film.We', 'know', 'was', 'civil', 'unrest', 'know', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'was', 'raging', 'cover', 'move', 'other', 'developements.This', 'very', 'much', 'politics', 'year', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'say', 'History', 'dry', 'subject', 'DVD', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'dispel', 'theory', 'History', 'not', 'only', 'events', 'people', 'was', 'little', 'attempt', 'cover', 'people', 'made', 'such', 'interesting', 'year', 'remember', 'Jackie', 'married', 'Onassis', 'was', 'nothing', 'else', 'front', 'newspapers', '5', 'days', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'rate', 'subliminal', 'blip', 'interviewers', 'radar', '.USS', 'Pueblo', 'captured', 'North', 'Koreans..', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'mentioned', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'student', 'riots', 'was', ""n't"", ""'Laugh"", 'most', 'outrageous', 'programmme', 'TV', 'year', 'only', 'mentioned', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'appeared', 'briefly', 'it.There', 'was', 'draw', 'first', 'time', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscars', 'not', 'covered.The', 'Graduate', '.Here', 'Mrs', 'Robinson', '.music', 'was', 'only', 'mentioned', 'was', 'related', 'protest', 'Brokaw', 'was', 'covering..The', 'novel', 'Myra', 'Breckinridge', 'was', 'published..there', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'areas', 'could', 'have', 'rounded', 'out', 'documentary.Limited', 'only', 'American', 'experience', 'not', 'cover', 'rioting', 'France', 'Czech', 'revolt.A', 'very', 'sober', 'limited', 'view', 'must', 'be', 'riot', 'dinner', 'party']",1968 with Tom Brokaw
