1651316,ALZUGEBMKKX89,B00CVB6XFW,A. W. Wilson,"[13, 13]","You would think a 1951 Allied Artists western starring Madison/Calhoun and Carole Matthews, and with a title like this would be  a rousing Cavalry vs Indians semi epic-Would you not? You will be disapointed if you do. Now I love westerns, have done for 50 years or more, and I seldom find one that I can't find anything to like. At least this has Carole Matthews as ""hostess with a heart of stone/gold"", but action it does not have until the final 10' or so (of a 77' film), and even then it is badly handled by director John Rawlins, as indeed he mishandles  most of the film. Neither Madison or Calhoun, both to become good action/western stars, seem at home here, and haven't quite found their persona. Of course it's not all bad, fine photography and an excellent b/w 4.3 print, and I guess if you are a fan and completist of Rory and Guy then you will have to get this regardless of what I say. A word of warning - Do not look closely at the photos on the back cover of the Warner Archive DVD - A bit of a Spoiler, and the plot description is misleading. I take little pleasure in writing this, but I hope it may help those in doubt.",3,"(NOT SO MUCH A)""MASSACRE RIVER"" Warner Archive",1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,1138,"['would', 'think', '1951', 'Allied', 'Artists', 'western', 'starring', 'Madison/Calhoun', 'Carole', 'Matthews', 'title', 'would', 'be', 'rousing', 'Cavalry', 'vs', 'Indians', 'semi', 'epic-Would', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'disapointed', 'do', 'Now', 'love', 'westerns', 'have', 'done', '50', 'years', 'more', 'seldom', 'find', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'like', 'least', 'Carole', 'Matthews', 'hostess', 'heart', 'stone/gold', 'action', 'not', 'have', 'final', '10', 'so', '77', 'film', 'even', 'then', 'badly', 'handled', 'director', 'John', 'Rawlins', 'indeed', 'most', 'film', 'Madison', 'Calhoun', 'become', 'good', 'action/western', 'stars', 'seem', 'home', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'found', 'persona', 'course', 'not', 'bad', 'fine', 'photography', 'excellent', 'b/w', '4.3', 'print', 'guess', 'are', 'fan', 'completist', 'Rory', 'Guy', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'get', 'regardless', 'what', 'say', 'word', 'warning', 'Do', 'not', 'look', 'closely', 'photos', 'back', 'cover', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'DVD', 'bit', 'Spoiler', 'plot', 'description', 'misleading', 'take', 'little', 'pleasure', 'writing', 'hope', 'may', 'help', 'doubt']",Massacre River

Two different girls love Guy Madison, who must chose between the colonel's daughter (who choses him over fellow officer Rory Calhoun) or the beautiful widow from the same side of the tracks he grew up on. When he choses the widow, who is tough, likeable, and much more interesting than the colonel's daughter, tragedy strikes when Madison's former friends don't understand.
