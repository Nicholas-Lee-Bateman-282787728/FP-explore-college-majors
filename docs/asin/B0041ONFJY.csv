1382007,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B0041ONFJY,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[1, 1]","Goran and Sven have been given the O.K. for the adoption process and are expecting a baby, 1.5 years old.  They live together in a nice, surrealistic white picket fence neighborhood with beautiful flowering yards.  When they receive the notice of a baby named Patrik, they prepare the nursery and all is well, including their relationship.However, a young troubled, homophobic teen arrives on their doorstep, and in waiting for their own child, they house the poor lad for a spell.  Apparently, a typo has caused the confusion.  During the wait for the correct child to arrive, the couple harbors Patrik til their prospective child arrives.  But the drama created with this unruly troublesome teen splits the two apart.  Sven, a drinker, is asked to leave the home, while Goran takes to bonding with Patrik.This is a feel good family film, and by family film, I mean a loving couple wanting to adopt.  There are a couple of passionate scenes some people may want to be warned about.  And, if you have young children, you may need to have them out of the room, or prepare them.What struck me about this Swedish film was the neighborhood, looking colorful and almost surreal. There isn't anything completely new about the film, just another manner in which the story is told.  It is with some light humor, and considered a light drama.  .....Enjoyable, Rizzo",4,"Feel good, family wishes film!",1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,1356,"['Goran', 'Sven', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'O.K', 'adoption', 'process', 'are', 'expecting', 'baby', '1.5', 'years', 'old', 'live', 'together', 'nice', 'surrealistic', 'white', 'picket', 'fence', 'neighborhood', 'beautiful', 'flowering', 'yards', 'When', 'receive', 'notice', 'baby', 'named', 'Patrik', 'prepare', 'nursery', 'well', 'including', 'relationship.However', 'young', 'troubled', 'homophobic', 'teen', 'arrives', 'doorstep', 'waiting', 'own', 'child', 'house', 'poor', 'lad', 'spell', 'Apparently', 'typo', 'caused', 'confusion', 'wait', 'correct', 'child', 'arrive', 'couple', 'harbors', 'Patrik', 'til', 'prospective', 'child', 'arrives', 'drama', 'created', 'unruly', 'troublesome', 'teen', 'two', 'apart', 'Sven', 'drinker', 'asked', 'leave', 'home', 'Goran', 'bonding', 'Patrik.This', 'feel', 'good', 'family', 'film', 'family', 'film', 'mean', 'loving', 'couple', 'wanting', 'adopt', 'are', 'couple', 'passionate', 'scenes', 'people', 'may', 'want', 'be', 'warned', 'have', 'young', 'children', 'may', 'need', 'have', 'room', 'prepare', 'struck', 'Swedish', 'film', 'was', 'neighborhood', 'looking', 'colorful', 'almost', 'surreal', ""n't"", 'anything', 'completely', 'new', 'film', 'just', 'manner', 'story', 'told', 'light', 'humor', 'considered', 'light', 'drama', '..Enjoyable', 'Rizzo']",N/A

There is nothing heavy handed about the script - there is no proselytising - everything unfolds at its own gentle and infectious pace.The film is based on a play by Michael Druker and the play is no doubt excellent, the film exceptional.You won't get any Bonus Material with the DVD - but the Chapter Headings are very good!!

1382011,A2X29H96X7C3XJ,B0041ONFJY,"Blue in Washington ""Barry Ballow""","[9, 10]","""Patrik, Age 1.5"" is a fine small film from Sweden that has some great things to say about compassion, honesty in relationships and seeing past stereotypes.  The film has a marvelous cast and is deftly directed by Ella Lemhagen.  In a nutshell, ""Patrik"" is the story of a gay professional couple (Goran and Sven), living a ""straight"" suburbanite life style, who apply to the local social services administration to adopt a baby.  Their application is approved, but even in socially progressive Sweden, babies are rarely placed with gay adoptive parents.  Out of the blue, the disappointed couple is informed that they have been chosen to parent Patrik, a 1.5 year old boy with a troubled past.  When Patrik arrives at their door, Goran and Sven discover that the letter from social services contained a small typo and that Patrik is actually a 15 year old with serious attitude, including some strongly stated homophobic bias.  As the couple tries to rectify what they perceive as an error, a bonding process with Patrik begins.  Goran, the more domestic  and nurturing member of the couple, in particular begins to see Patrik's situation with compassion.  His partner, Sven, is rapidly moving in the opposite direction and eventually precipitates a split when he repudiates the whole domestic setup.  The rest of the film is about the growth of the two adults as human beings and the adolescent Patrik into a trusting young adult.The cast of ""Patrik"" is uniformly excellent and the actors relate well and credibly to each other.  The real standouts in the film are Gustaf Skarsgard, who plays the ever optimistic and loving Goran and Tom Ljungman  who plays Patrik of the title role.  Skarsgard gives Goran emotional strength and humanity that prevails against the several crises that are written into the script.  Goran is able to endure everyday homophobia, a partner with a lot of baggage (history of alcohol abuse, inability to emotionally commit, etc.) and a host of bureaucratic obstacles in pursuit of parenthood.  Over the course of the film, he has the audience completely in his pocket, even when he gives up something that he wants very much in order to do the right thing for someone he loves.This is a sweet and effecting film that will require at least one handkerchief for most viewers.

1382012,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0041ONFJY,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[1, 1]","Goran and Sven are a married gay couple, ""out"" to their heterosexual neighbors in a Swedish version of the Desperate Housewives' Wisteria Lane. They are anxiously awaiting the results of their application to adopt a baby, to make their family complete, and have set up a cute nursery for him/her. First, they are told that there are no young children available to a gay couple, then are sent a notice that they can adopt ""Patrik, Age 1.5"" (2008) ... which they take to mean one and half years old.  They quickly agree, and are in for a surprise, when it turns out their young charge is actually fifteen years old, a juvenile delinquent and petty thief who has robbed people at knifepoint. This turns out to be the only child available, and, although neither of the men is happy about this (and neither is Patrik, who is quite homophobic), Goran pushes to let Patrik stay with them until another suitable couple is found.  Sven can't deal with that, and leaves Goran, just as he left his wife and daughter when he first took up with Goran.A rather simplistic story, but told beautifully here, with realism, pathos and just enough comic relief.  The way that the couple gets to know Patrik, and vice versa, can be a lesson for mainstream America to live together despite our natural diversity.  In Swedish with English subtitles, not rated (but would be an R for content), extras on DVD limited to chapter stops and trailer.

It's about neighbors and community.  It's about respect and prejudice, and changing the way people think and act.  The story revolves around a gay male couple recently moved into their suburban home full of 'traditional straight familes'.  Intent of adopting a baby, a mix-up occurs and they end up with 15-year old Patrik - troubled, and abused by a failed adoption/foster care system.  This homophobic young lad unintentionally wrecks havoc on the home life of Goran and Sven.  As the film unfolds, we learn just how much an open-mind and giving heart can change the way people think.  With dramatic moments, the story adds just enough laughs - so at worst, you may be laughing through your tears.  I won't give away the ending, but at least it's as positive as it can be without being too 'Brady Bunch' perfect.

This film was no exception.  Upon viewing as part of a group, it unfurls many levels that had gone unnoticed.""Patrik 1,5"" is a Swedish film with English subtitles made in 2008.  A gay couple adopting a child!  The child turns out not to be a 1  year old, but rather a 15 year old troublemaker with a criminal record.Wonderful set up!  This is a story whose time has come.  Who care's if the ending is predictable and characters, at times, follow stereotypes.  It's enjoyable to see different viewpoints offered by other cultures.  The sub titles can be over come.  However other flaws in the film created an uncomfortable first viewing experience.Having no idea of the body of work from the principles involved, it is hard to say if it is the writing, directing or acting that is weak.The part of Sven, played by Torkel Petersson comes off as a jerk, an alcoholic, and a generally mean guy, who dramatically changes, (for no apparent reason), to make the ending of the film make sense. One wishes this part had been ""fleshed-out"" a bit more.Interestingly the other half of the couple: Goran, played by Gustaf Skarsgrd seems almost too good to be true.  In another review here on Amazon.com, Goran was described as the ""stay at home mom"" ignoring the fact that the character is a working medical doctor!  Wow, the 21st. century and they still try to make us fit into their straight roles.After they find Patrik, their adopted baby is really a 15 year old boy; they leave a video monitor on to watch him.  At first that bothered me.  Now if we were to see the ""monitor"" as a metaphor for parenting, then it casts a much more comfortable and intriguing factor into the mix.By the same token Patrik, played by Tom Ljungman, turns out to have a gift at gardening.  A trait that might be seen in itself as a form of parenting.This could have been made as a great screwball romantic comedy. It could have been an insightful documentary.  As a drama, it could have delved into the dynamic of a couple who have different levels of maturity.However this films best effort was showing all of the prejudices found in even the most liberal of societies.  On the surface Patrik 1,5 is about gay parenting.  Beneath it is really about relationships and societies expectations.I would suggest the film ""Breakfast with Scot"" as a more focused alternative on the topic of Gay parenting.",3,More about prejudice than parenting,1305072000,"05 11, 2011",2011,2501,"['should', 'be', 'noted', 'films', 'are', 'designed', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'person', 'time', 'always', 'experience', 'film', 'was', 'exception', 'Upon', 'viewing', 'part', 'group', 'unfurls', 'many', 'levels', 'had', 'gone', 'unnoticed', 'Patrik', '1,5', 'Swedish', 'film', 'English', 'subtitles', 'made', '2008', 'gay', 'couple', 'adopting', 'child', 'child', 'out', 'not', 'be', '1', 'year', 'old', 'rather', '15', 'year', 'old', 'troublemaker', 'criminal', 'record.Wonderful', 'set', 'up', 'story', 'time', 'come', 'Who', 'care', 'ending', 'predictable', 'characters', 'times', 'follow', 'stereotypes', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'different', 'viewpoints', 'offered', 'other', 'cultures', 'sub', 'titles', 'can', 'be', 'come', 'However', 'other', 'flaws', 'film', 'created', 'uncomfortable', 'first', 'viewing', 'experience.Having', 'idea', 'body', 'work', 'principles', 'involved', 'hard', 'say', 'writing', 'directing', 'acting', 'weak.The', 'part', 'Sven', 'played', 'Torkel', 'Petersson', 'off', 'jerk', 'alcoholic', 'generally', 'mean', 'guy', 'who', 'dramatically', 'changes', 'apparent', 'reason', 'make', 'ending', 'film', 'make', 'sense', 'One', 'part', 'had', 'been', 'fleshed-out', 'bit', 'more.Interestingly', 'other', 'half', 'couple', 'Goran', 'played', 'Gustaf', 'Skarsgrd', 'almost', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'review', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'Goran', 'was', 'described', 'stay', 'home', 'mom', 'ignoring', 'fact', 'character', 'working', 'medical', 'doctor', 'Wow', '21st', 'century', 'still', 'try', 'make', 'fit', 'straight', 'roles.After', 'find', 'Patrik', 'adopted', 'baby', 'really', '15', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'leave', 'video', 'monitor', 'watch', 'first', 'bothered', 'Now', 'were', 'see', 'monitor', 'metaphor', 'parenting', 'then', 'much', 'more', 'comfortable', 'intriguing', 'factor', 'mix.By', 'same', 'token', 'Patrik', 'played', 'Tom', 'Ljungman', 'out', 'have', 'gift', 'gardening', 'trait', 'might', 'be', 'seen', 'form', 'parenting.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'great', 'screwball', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'insightful', 'documentary', 'drama', 'could', 'have', 'delved', 'dynamic', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'different', 'levels', 'maturity.However', 'films', 'best', 'effort', 'was', 'showing', 'prejudices', 'found', 'even', 'most', 'liberal', 'societies', 'surface', 'Patrik', '1,5', 'gay', 'parenting', 'really', 'relationships', 'societies', 'expectations.I', 'would', 'suggest', 'film', 'Breakfast', 'Scot', 'more', 'focused', 'alternative', 'topic', 'Gay', 'parenting']",N/A
1382017,AFZU6XDO5L75R,B0041ONFJY,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[3, 3]","This is truly an incredible film! The acting is superb by all three main cast members: Goran (Gustaf Skarsgrd), Sven (Torkel Petersson) and Patrik (Tom Ljungman). Goran and Sven, a gay couple have moved to a quaint neighborhood in the burbs in preparation for the arrival of their newly adopted son Patrik, however they are not to have the 1.5 year old baby they are planning for. A slight typo carries with it a whole lot of surprises with their new child, a not so typical 15 year old boy with a very checkered past. His mother died while he was a baby and no one else has ever been able to tame this troubled wild child. Having spent most of his life in a boy's home, he has no idea what love is and he's convinced he doesn't want any part of it. That isn't the ONLY thing he doesn't want any part of! Living with ""Homo's"" isn't exactly Patriks cup of tea, and he's not going to be shy about his feelings on the subject.Upon Patriks arrival, everything goes topsy turvy and the adventure begins. The relationship of Goran and Sven is tested to the breaking point, and the two part ways. Goran is left to handle Patrik, the homo-hating thug, who quickly learns to manipulate his new trustee. Just when it appears that life couldn't get much worse, something very unexpected happens; a funny little thing called love. But even love may have a little trouble tackling the heart of a child who never felt it and repair the damage that's been done to a once perfect relationship.The music is in english and sets the scene well for the scope of the film. Picture and sound quality are excellent and the scenery is beautiful, although parts of it resemble something you'd expect from the movie ""Pleasantville"" or the 1950's sit-com ""leave it to Beaver"". At first I wasn't sure about the casting of the parts of Goran and Sven. They didn't seem to have what it took to make a believable couple, however it didn't take long for that opinion to change. Wonderful acting by both, and Tom Ljungman done a remarkable job playing the role of Patrik. I anticipate future films with this kid.

Goran is a doctor and Sven is his husband. They were accepted for adoption but they were finally answered that no country in the world accepts to entrust a child for adoption to a homosexual couple. The deception is great but one day a letter arrives from social services. It contains a mistake and they are announced they will get a child of 1.5 years of age, Patrik is his name.Unluckily the kid that arrives is in fact 15, mother dead, father unknown, ten years in foster homes and institutions, a lot of delinquent acts, etc. Sven panics completely whereas Goran accepts the child, or rather teenager. Strangely enough Patrik is going to help Goran and Sven get accepted in the neighbourhood because he becomes the gardener of everyone, for money of course, and he becomes the skateboard coach of the kids in the street, etc.The end is a happy ending of course and it is not the real interest of the film. The real interest is to show that after and beyond all kinds of prejudices people deeply need at any age simple contact with others, contact that is called love and that it has nothing to do with sex really. Love is the food of angels and all children, and all people should be angels and get their ration, and even more that that everyday, of love.And it is so simple at times to find what can give someone the certainty they are loved, the guarantee they will be loved. Of course it is not simple and it cannot be easy to do but it is needed, provided people get out of their fears and fear is bigotry most of the time. We have no reason to be afraid of anything. To give a child one's own shirt for that child to look good when he needs to look good is more important than all the treasures of Arabia.That's the message of this film, and as such it works marvellously.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Bureaucracy can always be beaten,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,1899,"['film', 'based', 'qui', 'pro', 'quos', 'gay', 'married', 'couple', 'Sweden', 'new', 'neighbourhood', 'Goran', 'doctor', 'Sven', 'husband', 'were', 'accepted', 'adoption', 'were', 'finally', 'answered', 'country', 'world', 'entrust', 'child', 'adoption', 'homosexual', 'couple', 'deception', 'great', 'one', 'day', 'letter', 'social', 'services', 'mistake', 'are', 'announced', 'will', 'get', 'child', '1.5', 'years', 'age', 'Patrik', 'name.Unluckily', 'kid', 'fact', '15', 'mother', 'dead', 'father', 'unknown', 'ten', 'years', 'foster', 'homes', 'institutions', 'lot', 'delinquent', 'acts', 'etc', 'Sven', 'panics', 'completely', 'Goran', 'child', 'rather', 'teenager', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'Patrik', 'going', 'help', 'Goran', 'Sven', 'get', 'accepted', 'neighbourhood', 'gardener', 'everyone', 'money', 'course', 'skateboard', 'coach', 'kids', 'street', 'etc.The', 'end', 'happy', 'ending', 'course', 'not', 'real', 'interest', 'film', 'real', 'interest', 'show', 'kinds', 'prejudices', 'people', 'deeply', 'need', 'age', 'simple', 'contact', 'others', 'contact', 'called', 'love', 'nothing', 'do', 'sex', 'really', 'Love', 'food', 'angels', 'children', 'people', 'should', 'be', 'angels', 'get', 'ration', 'even', 'more', 'everyday', 'love.And', 'so', 'simple', 'times', 'find', 'what', 'can', 'give', 'someone', 'certainty', 'are', 'loved', 'guarantee', 'will', 'be', 'loved', 'course', 'not', 'simple', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'easy', 'do', 'needed', 'provided', 'people', 'get', 'fears', 'fear', 'bigotry', 'most', 'time', 'have', 'reason', 'be', 'afraid', 'anything', 'give', 'child', 'one', 'own', 'shirt', 'child', 'look', 'good', 'when', 'look', 'good', 'more', 'important', 'treasures', 'Arabia.That', 'message', 'film', 'such', 'marvellously.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

1382026,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B0041ONFJY,J. Martin,"[3, 3]","***** REVISED RATING - SEE NOTE BELOW *****This is a very, very sweet, very, very unreal movie. It reminds me a lot of a generic romantic comedy from the 1930s, when Hollywood's bread and butter was helping people escape from the brutality of the Great Depression into a magical world in which overwhelming obstacles were always overcome, troublesome heroes always turned out to have hearts of gold, and everything came up roses in the end.In fact, this movie could have been made almost exactly the same in 1936, with Mickey Rooney playing the adorable bad boy and his prospective parents any two from the studios' stable of romantic comedy duos. Of course, G&ouml;ran would be a woman instead of a man, but if they made Sven an ex-con they could get the same degree of social stigma as a gay couple has today and not have to change one word of dialog. Patrik would box instead of doing martial arts and skateboarding, but they wouldn't even have to change Sven's vice, since alcohol was the vice of choice 75 years ago too, not the cocaine or other snortable drug that's more common in movies today.I'm not saying I didn't enjoy this movie, because I did, but anybody on earth who thinks there's anything remotely true or relevant in this story is living in a dream world. It's pure escapism, which is great as long as we remember that's what it is.*****After further reflection I have raised the rating from three stars to five. The sweetness and warmth of this movie far outshine its unreality, and it's better than any of the 1930s Hollywood movies I was comparing it to. Even though the story is completely unreal, the wonderful feelings it produces are very real, very valuable, and especially welcome in the context of a gay marriage.",5,"A sweet, unreal revival of a 1930s Hollywood staple",1294358400,"01 7, 2011",2011,1742,"['*****', 'REVISED', 'RATING', 'SEE', 'NOTE', 'BELOW', '*****This', 'very', 'very', 'sweet', 'very', 'very', 'unreal', 'movie', 'lot', 'generic', 'romantic', 'comedy', '1930s', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'bread', 'butter', 'was', 'helping', 'people', 'escape', 'brutality', 'Great', 'Depression', 'magical', 'world', 'overwhelming', 'obstacles', 'were', 'always', 'overcome', 'troublesome', 'heroes', 'always', 'turned', 'out', 'have', 'hearts', 'gold', 'everything', 'came', 'up', 'roses', 'end.In', 'fact', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', '1936', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'playing', 'adorable', 'bad', 'boy', 'prospective', 'parents', 'two', 'studios', 'stable', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'duos', 'course', 'G', 'ouml', 'ran', 'would', 'be', 'woman', 'instead', 'man', 'made', 'Sven', 'ex-con', 'could', 'get', 'same', 'degree', 'social', 'stigma', 'gay', 'couple', 'today', 'not', 'have', 'change', 'one', 'word', 'dialog', 'Patrik', 'would', 'box', 'instead', 'doing', 'martial', 'arts', 'skateboarding', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'change', 'Sven', 'vice', 'alcohol', 'was', 'vice', 'choice', '75', 'years', 'ago', 'too', 'not', 'cocaine', 'other', 'snortable', 'drug', 'more', 'common', 'movies', 'today.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'did', 'anybody', 'earth', 'who', 'anything', 'remotely', 'true', 'relevant', 'story', 'living', 'dream', 'world', 'pure', 'escapism', 'great', 'as', 'long', 'remember', 'what', '*****After', 'further', 'reflection', 'have', 'raised', 'rating', 'three', 'stars', 'five', 'sweetness', 'warmth', 'movie', 'far', 'unreality', 'better', '1930s', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'was', 'comparing', 'Even', 'story', 'completely', 'unreal', 'wonderful', 'feelings', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'valuable', 'especially', 'welcome', 'context', 'gay', 'marriage']",N/A

1382029,A18IPB2PPWUZCI,B0041ONFJY,Max Fabien,"[3, 3]","""Patrik Age 1.5"" tells the story of how one minor typographical error can change the lives of several people. It's a moving, sometimes funny, sometimes sad film about a gay couple in Sweden who want to adopt a baby. I hope that some potential viewers do not pass on this film thinking that it's a ""gay"" film. This film has universal appeal. It's real in its depiction of the acception by some and rejection by others of gay people. It shows how a gay couple struggle and deal with the same problems as straight couples, such as money, drinking, jealousy, but there is still a deep rooted love that binds them together. The film also shows the heartbreak of an abandoned teen. He comes off as tough as nails, filled with anger and hate. But it's just a disguise for a scared, sad, lonely boy who is deeply hurting, and desperately needs to be loved. One of the most heart warming, emotional films in recent memory, with just enough comedy elements to keep it light and very amusing. I'm surprised this film didn't get an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film for 2008. It certaily deserved one.",5,What?

Is gay love strong enough to form a family and hold it together or can only straight love do that?In the film, a gay couple wants to adopt a baby.  A ""mistake"" in a social service agency form sends a 15 year old rather than a 1.5 year old to the couple.  The mistake turns into a tragedy because the 15 year old, named Patrik, is a homophobe scared to death of the couple and the couple is scared to death of Patrik.The couple wants to send Patrik back to the agency and Patrik definitely wants to get away from the couple.

It does follow some of the tropes; the happy ending, but it is also quite an endearing film with great performances from all involved.

Goran and Sven want to adopt a baby (well, moreso Goran but Svens going along with it and trying to act excited about it) and they think everythings going just fine but when they show up after being cleared for adoption they find out that they aren't okayed for adoption because they are a gay couple.  They decide they'll try for adopting a swedish child and through a typo they, believing they are adopting a 1 and a half year old tike named Patrik are actually adopting a 15 year old homophobic teenager with a violent past with a criminal record.  As they try and get rid of Patrik Gorans parenting nature kicks in and he tries to reach out to the boy through Patriks interest in gardening and Sven finds Patriks too much to bother.I dont want to tell much more than that but its not as predictable as I thought it would be.
