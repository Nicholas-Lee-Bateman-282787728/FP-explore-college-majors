1591651,ARD3PHGID0FST,B009AMAKWM,"Amazon Customer ""Chandra (Cee)""","[0, 0]","Why are you only talking about this movie now? Well, I personally do not fancy the theaters and because of the mix reviews, I have been putting it off. I am a huge fan of Cassandra Clare, but I am not bias. This movie was entertaining, but there were some off points. Let's get to it.The characters. The actors were not as animated as I would have liked them to be. They seemed so &#8230; stiff. I mean, I am in no way and actor myself, but as a person who has read the books, I can justify that it is only fair I expected a bit more life brought to the characters; because the way I saw them in my mind, especially Jace and Magnus Bane, was definitely more livelier and full of personalities. Far from what I received from the movie. I know that we should not compare, but even if it was solely based on the movie alone, without the interference of the book, I still would have found the actors a bit awkward. Because of this, it sort of dropped my expectations for this, highly anticipated, film.What I enjoyed. I thought the graphics and setting of the movie to be very believable and well done. Although the City of Bones was not as I expected, it was still amazing! You can tell that a lot of thought was put into it. The scenes with the portal was awesome!Another aspect of the movie I enjoyed, was the action. I thought it was well choreographed, but most importantly, it looked real (Isabelle, kicked ass!). I cannot phantom how many movies I have seen, where the action scenes looks so &#8230; WWE&#8212;Or at least how I remembered watching it, (I know there were some real injuries, but) the punches seemed so unreal&#8212;they were a good couple of inches away from the other opponent. I am not bashing WWE, because I use to watch it ALL the time with my bro, but mainly trying to give you the idea/picture.Moving on.The soundtrack, during the action scene (mainly the brawl with the vampires). It threw me off. Imagine this, Me: &#8220;Yeah, it is getting (the music starts) downnnn (voice fades) &#8230;&#8221; I got sidetracked. It just-did not-go well with that particular scene.The plot. There are quite a number of people, who did not enjoy the plot; which is normal. But, I believe most of them are those who have not read the entire series. Overall, what I am saying is, this film was definitely made for die-hard YA fans&#8212;especially those of the series. Which is why I like it, regardless of the weaker points I mentioned above.Would I recommend it? Why not? If you need a teen-flick that has action, romance, and a complicated premise, check it out. However, keep in mind that it is a series, and the ending will be left open-ended.",3,"I like it, but it could have been better.",1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,2659,"['Why', 'are', 'only', 'talking', 'movie', 'now', 'Well', 'personally', 'do', 'not', 'fancy', 'theaters', 'mix', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'putting', 'off', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Cassandra', 'Clare', 'am', 'not', 'bias', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'were', 'points', 'Let', 'get', 'it.The', 'characters', 'actors', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'animated', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'be', 'seemed', 'so', '8230', 'stiff', 'mean', 'am', 'way', 'actor', 'person', 'who', 'read', 'books', 'can', 'justify', 'only', 'fair', 'expected', 'bit', 'more', 'life', 'brought', 'characters', 'way', 'saw', 'mind', 'especially', 'Jace', 'Magnus', 'Bane', 'was', 'definitely', 'more', 'livelier', 'full', 'personalities', 'Far', 'what', 'received', 'movie', 'know', 'should', 'not', 'compare', 'even', 'was', 'solely', 'based', 'movie', 'alone', 'interference', 'book', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'actors', 'bit', 'awkward', 'sort', 'dropped', 'expectations', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'film.What', 'enjoyed', 'thought', 'graphics', 'setting', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'believable', 'well', 'done', 'City', 'Bones', 'was', 'not', 'expected', 'was', 'still', 'amazing', 'can', 'tell', 'lot', 'thought', 'was', 'put', 'scenes', 'portal', 'was', 'awesome', 'aspect', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'action', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'choreographed', 'most', 'importantly', 'looked', 'real', 'Isabelle', 'kicked', 'ass', 'can', 'not', 'phantom', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'where', 'action', 'scenes', 'so', '8230', 'WWE', '8212', 'least', 'how', 'remembered', 'watching', 'know', 'were', 'real', 'injuries', 'punches', 'seemed', 'so', 'unreal', '8212', 'were', 'good', 'couple', 'inches', 'away', 'other', 'opponent', 'am', 'not', 'bashing', 'WWE', 'use', 'watch', 'time', 'bro', 'mainly', 'trying', 'give', 'idea/picture.Moving', 'on.The', 'soundtrack', 'action', 'scene', 'mainly', 'brawl', 'vampires', 'threw', 'off', 'Imagine', 'Me', '8220', 'Yeah', 'getting', 'music', 'downnnn', 'voice', 'fades', '8230', '8221', 'got', 'sidetracked', 'just-did', 'not-go', 'well', 'particular', 'scene.The', 'plot', 'are', 'quite', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'plot', 'normal', 'believe', 'most', 'are', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'entire', 'series', 'Overall', 'what', 'am', 'saying', 'film', 'was', 'definitely', 'made', 'die-hard', 'YA', 'fans', '8212', 'especially', 'series', 'Which', 'why', 'regardless', 'weaker', 'points', 'mentioned', 'above.Would', 'recommend', 'Why', 'not', 'need', 'teen-flick', 'action', 'romance', 'complicated', 'premise', 'check', 'out', 'However', 'keep', 'mind', 'series', 'ending', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'open-ended']",The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones

1591662,A2GLQE3IMC39JF,B009AMAKWM,Amy Donnelly,"[3, 5]","A movie made from a popular book series will never please everyone, we know that from past experiences. There will always be someone who has a different idea of what a character looks or acts like, what a set should be be, etc. The good thing about this movie is that even though it uses the book it is not shy about putting its own ideas onto the screen. Some people want all of the novel into the movie, which is unrealistic unless you want a movie the size of Lord of the Rings (all of them).The movie though is very good in my opinion. The main cast have a obvious chemistry which works well. The action sequences are well shot and forward the plot nicely, Bower and Myer's past experience in period pieces shows itself in their ease with the weapons. The handheld shots work well, as does the dark shadows in the backgrounds of most of the shots giving it that eery feel. Yes the directors and writers took some liberties with the novel but it created a film that had a straightforward storyline for those people who hadn't read the series. Hopefully we find out more about the complexities of the fantasy world in the second movie.I see no problem with this movie, it gives a good basis for the second (and maybe more) movie.

Because of this I have held off watching this movie for a long time since I could not think of any thing that could be taken out and not effect the entire story line for this part and the ones that come after.  The answer was that the filmmakers tried cramming everything in in under 2 hours in order to tell all the necessary story lines.  The result is that the entire movie felt rushed from the beginning.  I don't how anyone who hasn't read the books would not walk away confused and suffering from information overload.  One part I felt the filmmakers did right though was revealing that Jace and Clary are not actually brother and sister from the beginning.  This fact was held back until the end of the third book and made their feelings for each other creepy, but also made you think that there had to be more to the story.

Even at the end of this film, this twist is still not resolved. It entices the audience to wait for the sequels. I'm sorry, I can't tell you exactly what it is. Otherwise, it will ruin your enjoyment.- The actress is attractive.- The special effects are scary and gripping in some scenes but they are disappointing in others. For example, the scene, where in her house, the dog turned into something terrifying and suspensefully chasing her down. In other scenes, they look less interesting than the ones in other films.- The acting is acceptable.

I bought the DVD set and haven't stopped watching it since.Yes, the film did some radical interpretations of the text it still came out shining in the end. While Jamie Campbell Bower wouldn't have ever been on my top 100 actors to play Jace, to my great surprise, he thoroughly embraced the character and sold me within minutes. Lily Collins is a fantastic Clary (definitely an actress whose career I will continue to watch with great interest) and the chemistry is definitely there between the two leads. I can't wait to see how they will portray their burgeoning attraction to one another, while dealing with the incestual ickyness in City of Ashes.All the other actors were aptly cast, particularly John Rhys Meyers as Valentine. Wow...I don't think there was a better choice to play such a dark, slightly psychotic character.To all those naysayers out in the world who diss and dismiss this movie, I ask you to think about some of the other YA novels that have been given over to Hollywood to twist and warp as the screenwriters saw fit. Try to remember to judge on a curve. The Twilight series was ruined for me simply because of Kristen Stewart, who couldn't seem to register an emotion if her existence depended on it.

But I refused because it sounded stupid.Then on a cold January night in the year 2011, I had run out of books to read and was hard up for my next adventure. (I control my addiction, I swear). Nothing was good on television and I was all out of video games to get lost in, so I walked into my brothers room and politely asked to borrow City Of Bones. He handed it over with a smirk like the devil he is and said ""have fun"".And so I got comfortable in my bed and opened the cover. Next thing I know, it is a hour later and I am nowheres close to being done. I was involved, for whatever reason, the world of Clary and Jace's had me hook, line, and sinker.Even though I could not stand Clary and even though I'm not attracted to blondes like Jace, I liked the first in the series. (I've read City of Ashes and City of Glass. I ended it there. That was enough for me).And like mother like daughter, my mom came to the point in her life where she was also out of books to read and so I handed over the copy of City of Bones that now sits on my bookshelf (my brother was more than happy to get rid of it).Flash forward to 2013 when we are both sitting in the theater awaiting the previews and then the big event.Then flash forward to an hour in when I'm racking my brain trying to figure out why in the hell this was even able to get past Cassandra Clare (probably because she is a money grubbing turtle, that's why).Then flash forward to my mom turning to me and saying ""what the s***"". And I was pretty sure at that exact moment there would be no movie sequel. (I was wrong of course. So very wrong).My hope was up for the movie. It had a ton of good actors playing some of the characters I loved the most. Most importantly, it had Aidan Turner and Johnathan Rhys Myers playing two of the characters that made the books for me. (And whoever played Simon. I loved him! He did perfect).But the writing was something else entirely. I don't even know what the hell. Like I cant even. It was just strange. Overworked. Rundown.Not to mention the fact that Jamie Bower was never my Jace (Alex Pettyfer all the way. Even blonde I'm okay with him) and frankly he did not fit the bill. He was not the muscular hot head that Jace is supposed to be.(Let it be said that I do not hate Jamie. No way, no how. You're adorable, honey. Just not as Jace).As far as adaptations go, this did not hit the mark. With die hard fans or regular people like me. And with all that being said, I'd probably still watch it again.But Simon, though. I enjoy him.

I have never read the books.The good: Whomever edited this movie was mostly brilliant. I saw scenes that were cut just right...and I could tell even a second more would have made the scene really bad.I know some people didn't like the music, but I thought it was done fairly well. I could tell which emotion they were trying to evoke in the audience with each piece, so they did something right.It might be a chick flick, but it had enough action to keep a guy from falling asleep.Chemistry between the lead actors. The characters of Simon, Clary and Jace worked very well together.Some very good camera work, if you looked for it.The story was a little choppy, but I could follow without having read the books. I had no idea who some of the character names were in the beginning, but they all got named eventually. There's something to be said for not going for instant knowledge of everything in a movie.Sets-most were perfect for the given scene, with nice attention to detail. Loved the crypts in the City of Bones.I enjoyed the story as it unfolded. Having no prior knowledge, it had a few hiccups in flow, but there was an actual plot (or plots, as the case may be)The bad:Godfrey Gao-not only was he given the worst lines and costumes ever, his delivery was nothing short of abysmally wooden.Special Effects- Very uneven. It looked like they ran out of time and money. Places where there should have been SOMEthing (like when Magnus is healing Alec) were left looking cheesy. Other places the effects were perfect.Uneven acting-I'll bet I could tell you which scenes were shot first....Some lines were delivered so quickly or quietly that I missed them the first time (yes,I went back)Werewolves-Again, it looked like they ran out of budget to do them right.I came expecting the standard brains-bleeding-out-of-your-ears-by-the-end-of-the-movie badly written teen flick (Twilight comes to mind...) and left liking the movie quite a bit. The kids didn't find it so horrendously off (think the ""golden cornucopia-not"" of the Hunger Games movie) that they hated it, and I was surprised that most of the movie was as good as it was.

For example, why in tarnation would Shadowhunters let Simon into their sanctuary (the New York Institute), further compromising the secrecy of that corner of the Shadow World? Because a Twilight love triangle is needed, of course.And yes, this film will give youTwilightflashbacks, whether it is a werewolf pouncing on a vampire or the girl being impressed by the silently tormented protagonist playing classical music on his piano. The film is not shy about ripping off shots from other productions. The portal is remarkably similar to the Stargate, right down to the blue shimmering that it eminates onto people in the gateroom. I am uncertain whether these moments are an homage to other productions, or just outright theft.I have not read the book and don't intend to, so please don't comment that I should read the book. I bought this Blu-ray because I enjoy most films in the genre and certain actors in this one: Lena Headey aka Queen Cersei Lannister (seeWinter Is Coming), Jared Harris from FRINGE (seeIn Which We Meet Mr. Jones), and Aidan Turner from Being Human UK (seeThough the Heavens Fall). Unfortunately, Robert Sheehan was cast for a major role (this is the actor who was excruciatingly annoying inMisfits Season One). Overall, the casting was spot-on, with just a few hiccups.If you are in it for the special effects, the pretty faces, the sometimes dark urban ambience, and snipets of Hollywoodized Goth culture, then by all means, give it a try.

I know book fans of The Mortal Instruments will want to deliver a thumbs down from the moment they read the title... But please, hear me out. (: I own and have read the entire series, that has thus far, been released. I definitely did not love the first book but it was enjoyable enough. I read the others only because they were given to me as a gift. Then I felt like they went downhill from there. The author started out okay, but it quickly began to feel like 'a money maker' to me. Forcing stories, characters not staying dead, dragging out pointless plots... Anyway, as for the movie... I almost always prefer the book over the movie, as I think most readers do. But because I felt, ""meh"" about the book, the movie won out this time around.It did feel darker and scarier than the book, and maybe that is my own imagination of the feared to blame. They kept with the book for the most part, but did change several details that made me cock my head to the side. (i.e. the creature in the apartment, the final showdown location, clary seeing that mark in the beginning and writing it all over her room, Simon getting bit was in a later book etc.) The actors did a great job. Jace wasn't as attractive in my opinion as he was written in the book. BUT, he did grow on me. Lily Collins was gorgeous and awesome as Clary. It was suspenseful and action packed almost the entire time. There was only a sprinkle of romance, so don't expect a bunch of make-out scenes and sappy love stories. I sigh regrettably, as my brother would cheer. It had laugh-out-loud-in-the-theatre moments. (Even some that weren't meant to be funny. Ahem. Cough. Portal Scene.)

1591771,A1L5WAZAL5H1SA,B009AMAKWM,Jon (Scott Reads It!),"[1, 5]","The Mortal Instruments: City Of Bones was one of my most anticipated movies this year; I have been a fan of the book series for years and I was dying to see how this movie translated to the big screen. I wasn't exactly pleased with the casting originally, but the cast definitely grew on me. Considering I had such high expectations for this movie, it definitely was extremely disappointing, but it wasn't as terrible as some are saying.City Of Bones is one of the few book-to-movie adaptations that are mostly true to it's source material. For the most part, much of the movie is lifted straight from the book, but that didn't work too well for this movie. Harald Zwart decided to include most of the action scenes from the book which is fine, as long as you include vital segments.The action scenes are well choreographed, excellently executed, and are extremely thrilling. I definitely think the action scenes are one of the highlights of the movie and I absolutely loved them. The action scenes felt very real and they really captured these intense moments from the books well. The problem is that Zwart sacrifices valuable screen time to devote to the mechanics of Cassandra Clare's world. The Clave, Parabatis, steles, and so many significant items from the books aren't explained or if they are it's a casual mention. How would viewers unfamiliar with the books know what The Accords are? The Accords are mentioned, yet no one bothers to explain this to the average, unknowing viewer. This movie really wasn't made for those who aren't part of The Mortal Instruments fandom because it does a poor job of introducing viewers to Shadowhunters.I was a bit afraid that City Of Bones would be too heavy on cheesy, CGI effects, but that is not the case. The special effects are well done and are a visual treat to viewers for most of the movie. I was pretty impressed with the visuals in the movie and they were a nice surprise.City Of Bones has a poorly written script and so many of the movie's faults stem from there. Much of the dialogue is weak, implausible, and just ridiculous much to my surprise. Cassandra Clare writes some of the best dialogue in her books and I was disappointed how many lines they had used from the text. The screenwriters used only a few notable lines from the book even though there was so many opportunities for more usage. Much of the dialogue came across as awkward and just didn't feel conversational AT ALL. The lack of proper dialogue lead to feeble character dialogue and left something to be desired.I'm going to break down the acting by actor because the acting was very uneven.Lily Collins as Clary: Lily portrayed Clary better than I thought she would, her performance was definitely the most notable in the movie. Lily was the perfect person for the part of Clary and she definitely gave it her all.Jamie Campbell Bower as Jace: As soon as Jamie was cast as Jace, I was extremely skeptical and nervous how his performance as Jace. Jamie does a mediocre job of portraying Jace because he lacks the snarky attitude that is essentially a huge part of Jace. Jamie didn't capture the tortured, conflicted feelings that Jace is filled with throughout City Of Bones. Jamie always looked mopey throughout the movie but Jace smiles and laugh so much in City Of Bones. This isn't to say that Jamie is a poor actor, he's a great actor, but I'm not sure if he was cut out for this role.Godfrey Gao as Magnus: I just can't even. Godfrey had maybe 2 minutes of on-screen time when Magnus is a huge part of City Of Bones. I really can't comment on Godfrey as an actor, because the filmmakers didn't give him much to experiment with besides a few flimsy lines. In City Of Ashes, I want more flamboyance, humor, and more light-heartedness from Gao.Robert Sheehan as Simon: Robert wasn't exactly how I pictured Simon to be, I imagined Simon to be more geeky when I first read CoB. I know each reader has their own vision of each character so I can't fault Sheehan on this. Sheehan played the part well and all of his reactions seemed extremely genuine.I can't really comment on Kevin Zeger's and Jemima West's performances justfully because I feel like I didn't see enough of either of them in the movie to give a proper jurisdiction.The romance in City Of Bones didn't do the book justice at all. I adored Jace and Clary's relationship in the books, but I felt like the movie distorted their relationship beyond reason. There was little development in their relationship and it all felt too much like insta-love to me. The worst of the romance occurs in the Greenhouse scene which was all too much for me. The Greenhouse scene felt incredibly awkward to me and pretty unromantic, this scene was hard to watch for me. Why did they have it rain while they kissed? To make things even worse, the Demi Lovato song that they blasted when Clary and Jace kissed was so unfitting and made me want to cringe. I really don't think the filmmakers could have made this scene even more awkward or cliche for viewers.I was worried how the filmmakers would handle Valentine and the scene in his lair. I get that the filmmakers were on a budget, but I really don't think staging this scene beneath The Institute really worked too well. The battle scene didn't work too well there and I really think it would have worked better in Renwick's. Another addition I don't understand is the addition of Valentine's henchmen because they really didn't add much to the movie.I have one last and final complaint about the film, but it was an overwhelming issue for me. I wouldn't exactly call City Of Bones as so many critics have, but City Of Bones definitely borrows a bit from these franchises. I really don't understand why the filmmakers had to borrow aspects from these franchises. City Of Bones is a novel with so much excellent material and borrowing from other franchises was completely unnecessary and just made City Of Bones look like a Harry Potter/Twilight copycat. Sure they only adopted a few things into the movie, but it irked me to no end. City Of Bones is NOT Harry Potter, it's not Twilight, and it's most certainly not The Hunger Games. The filmmakers didn't understand that City Of Bones is it's own novel and doesn't need to feel like other popular YA franchises.There are just so many things that bothered me about The Mortal Instruments: City Of Bones, I could probably ramble on and on about this all day. The bottom line is that The Mortal Instruments isn't a bad movie, but it suffers from a weak script and other poor choices on the filmmakers' parts.

I wasn't really sure what to expect and frankly didn't have high expectations and though it was some sort of Twilight clone.  And to a certain extent it does mimic several different movies before it, it does remind me a bit of Twilight, Underworld and others as it tries to be a bit of all of those movies.  But even with all of that, I was pleasantly surprised at this movie.  I am not a Twilight fan but definitely an Underworld fan and I found that this movie had enough elements of each to balance out and make a good story.  I really don't think this movie deserves the criticism that it is getting from those who are trashing it and comparing to Twilight.  Maybe this movie suffers from Twilight fatigue, I don't know but it is really worth watching.  The action is good and entertaining and keeps the movie from stalling for very long and has very nice pacing.  The special effects are good and the scenery very well done.  My only real issue is that they fail to really tie up any loose ends in the movie, which of course for any movie these days is setting up for the sequel.  The question is now whether there will be a sequel due to its box office numbers.

1591782,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,B009AMAKWM,K. Boullosa,"[4, 7]","I went to see this expecting the worst, but frankly had quite an enjoyable time.  I really love magical stories, and while I agree with some viewers that it was extremely derivative of both recent and older sword and sorcery books and films, I don't think there is much original to be said about underground communities of magical beings, youthful or not.The script was decent if not inspiring, and the youthful cast reasonably attractive and sincere. The fact that Aidan Turner, barely 30 years old, and with a streak of white deliberately added to his curly dark hair, functioned as a senior member of the cast, gives you some idea of how youth-oriented the film is (and, therefore, I suppose the books, which I have not read, as well).With the exception of blond young Jace, played by Jamie Campbell Bower, who has a faint aura of Mick Jagger-like charisma and a delicious voice, the seniors (Turner and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, of ""The Tudors"" fame) rather outclassed the youngsters in terms of screen charisma. Lily Collins did well enough as Clary, but she lacks the kind of force that will take her past the bloom of youth. And Luke Garroway's part seemed to me to be oddly truncated - as I haven't read the books, I'm not sure of this, but that's the way it seemed.  My advice to Turner, by the way, who really can act given half a chance (take a look at him in the very adult drama, ""Hattie"" and in ""Desperate Romantics""), is to end the involvement with fantasy films (he's done a vampire, a werewolf, and a dwarf at this point) and regroup and try to find some challenging adult roles before he starts losing his hair, his looks, and his chances to transition back to serious acting.The magical effects were fine. On balance, in fact, MI:COB was much better than ""Man of Steel"", during which I nearly screamed with boredom at the inane script and endless explosions. It's not quite up to the quality of Harry Potter, let alone Lord of the Rings, its naked longings in those directions show too much to get quite to those levels, but it was nevertheless enjoyable on its own.Turner, by the way (SPOILER ALERT!), has the best line in the film: while driving off in a truck with Clary to rescue her mother and Jace from the clutches of Valentine Morgenstern, Clary, who now knows Luke is a werewolf, tells him to feel free to hang his head out the window. ""I'm a werewolf,"" he snaps, ""not a golden retriever!""And that's as good as the script gets.

I read the book about 9 months ago...sorry, tried to read, I fell asleep a dozen times at how boringly slow the book pace was.  Being descriptive is great, but not to the point where you nod off waiting for some action.  The movie gave you all the action and cut out the snooze fest!  I have yet to finish the book and don't think I will.  If the powers that be do not follow this movie with sequels, I will have to wait for the authors last book to come out.  If the reviews prove that Jace and Clary have a HEA as they are not siblings, I'll give the books another shot. Not that I'm all about the romance, but I happen to like happy endings and good kicking evil's butt.  As to the movie itself, I was never bored and I never felt myself comparing it to another series as others seem to have done.  I did have Jace pictured in my head slightly different than the actor, but ten minutes in and I felt he nailed the part.  Remember people, these are teenage characters, do not expect them to show extreme maturity because of the circumstances they find themselves in.  As for Lily Collins, I enjoyed her in Mirror Mirror.  The Clary character in the book was annoying at times, but not as much as other heroines I've read. (cough, Katniss Everdeen, cough) and I found myself wanting to mentally slap her around a bit...not so with movie Clary.  I think Collins improved the character and I didn't feel the 'slap her' urge once.  This is one of the reasons I enjoyed the movie better than the book.So, to sum it all up -- I very much enjoyed this movie.  The action never stopped.  The storyline was great and I found 2 hours and 10 minutes flying by.  There, of course, is a lot of information that was left out of the movie, but I never found myself missing the parts that weren't there.

I kept up with the books that long because they were decent cheesy fun, but it felt like they were starting to cannibalize themselves.  (I do think Cassandra Clare's Infernal Devices trilogy is more original and interesting.)However, Jeanette Catsoulis' review for The New York Times made the movie The Mortal Instruments: The City of Bones sound like a ridiculous, but fun time.  Thus, after a too long day at the office (5:40 is just wrong on a Friday), I headed to the theater.  (Okay, I headed to somewhere to eat, and then I shopped at Target, and then I went to the 8:15 showing.)The cast does a good job.  Lily Collins made a negative impression on me in Mirror, Mirror (a film I couldn't like despite my best intentions), but here she's got a nice bit of attitude and determination to carry her through Clary's bewilderment.  Jamie Campbell Bower looks wonderful in motion, and gives Jace a nice bit of vulnerability to temper his cockiness.  The adults are all fine, as long as you don't mind Jonathan Rhys Meyers chewing the scenery in a manner that will almost make you forget that his character's actions make no sense.  As Valentine, he's also strangely sexual with Jace and Clary, given that he's trying to convince him that he's their father.  The weakest acting link is probably Kevin Zegers, but then again,  he's saddled with the thankless storyline of over-the-top jealousy and cattiness.And okay, I'd probably bump the movie up any mental grade because it has CCH Pounder in it, and I've loved her since I first saw Baghdad Cafe.  She's in fine form here as an agoraphobic witch, a small but crucial role.""Small but crucial"" defines most of what happens in TMI: COB.  There's a lot being thrown at the audience, and I suspect much of it doesn't make much sense unless you've read the book.  There are a bunch of characters, a bunch of creatures, and a couple of goals (the cup and Clary's mom).  I doubt many moviegoers will be satisfied by the resolution, which shows absolutely no one worried about Jocelyn, still in a coma.It's a better movie than I expected, for fans of the book.  If you liked the story, I'd go ahead and see it.  (Or rent it once it's out on video.)  But I doubt it will appeal much to other audiences, because it's overstuffed and too derivative.  Also, there was no place to mention this earlier, but the now frequently mocked pop-song-playing-over-makeout-in-the-greenhouse scene deserves to be mocked.  It's too cheesy even for TMI: COB.General movie note:  Recent parents, I know you still have lives and want to get out of the house.

1591803,A2ZRCNY3FVR4AI,B009AMAKWM,"Lucas Goldstein ""Luke Goldstein""","[0, 2]","After the wild success of Harry Potter, Twilight and The Hunger Games it only makes sense the movie studios would rush out to grab any and every young adult and kids level book series with any promise or decent sales figures. Nothing wrong with that from a business perspective. These books have a built-in audience, which tells the studios there should be a reasonable expectation of a certain level of ticket sales. The real danger is it can fail horribly if the movie is not adapted well, especially when you are looking down the barrel of a three-to-four book series. Franchises will not continue if the first film fails to make it off the box office launch pad. That brings me to our current adaptation, looking to pick up the torch of the young adult franchise wars.The Mortal Instruments &#8211; City of Bones is the first of a six-book series (final book due out in 2014.). It surrounds a young girl named Clary, who finds out her mother had a dark secret passed down to her. A power to see not only demons and all sorts of nightmarish legends, but also the people who hunt them. After being recruited into a group of these Shadow Hunters, Clary struggles to help them find a magical cup that grants the person who drinks from it incredible powers. Along the way, she also must decide where her loyalties and loves lie, in the real world or in the fantasy world.I&#8217;m going to put this right out front: this is far and away aboveTwilight, pretty much in line with the first Hunger Games film, and better than certain volumes of the Potter franchise (mainly books one and two.) The action sequences, character design and overall scenic look of the film are very well done. The goth kid-cum-demon hunter is a fun look, sort of a junior version of watching the Blade trilogy.The casting of these hopefully long-lasting characters was done with care. Lily Collins (Clary) takes the helm as the young, naive fish out of water. She definitely has a certain charm about her, a presence on-screen that is natural, but there are moments here where she relies to heavily on theRyan Gosling method of success (just staring off camera in deep thought.) Robert Sheehan plays he lovelorn best friend Simon, the human element in the film. He&#8217;s mainly there to represent the audience, one character on-screen to give us the outlet for saying, &#8220;What the hell is going on here?&#8221; He&#8217;s good, very reminiscent of Jay Baruchel in The Sorcerer&#8217;s Apprentice. Jonathan Rhys Meyers tops the &#8220;well-known&#8221; bill by playing the main villain, Valentine. He doesn&#8217;t show up until the last quarter of the movie, giving his usual intense performance: a sort of stoicism laced with psychotic rage. The breakout performance here is actually from Jamie Campbell Bower, who plays possible love interest and main Shadow Hunter, Jace. He has a power on camera, an intensity that matches well with Meyers. He also gets to balance his character between brash badass and playful protagonist, which always makes for a more interesting character.On the down side, this movie suffers from the curse of the &#8220;origin story&#8221; that all franchises deal with. Running at just over two hours long it has to set up all the stories and plot lines that will continue through the franchise, if the other movies actually ever get made. The danger in that is if you don&#8217;t make sure to make the first movie tight and enjoyable enough, there will be no audience waiting when the next chapter comes around. There are a ton of questions and scenarios introduced here, but very few actually tied up, so the movie comes off as long and mostly unfinished. I haven&#8217;t read the books, so I can&#8217;t say what I would have left out, but the movie could have benefitted more from a ninety-minute running time more than complete accuracy and allegiance to the source material.The Mortal Instruments &#8211; City of Bones isn&#8217;t bad and it makes me curious for what the next chapter will bring, but I&#8217;m not convinced this chapter set the bar high enough to call for the money it will take to get the second one made.",3,"Has potential, but not quite there yet.",1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,4138,"['wild', 'success', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Twilight', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'only', 'sense', 'movie', 'studios', 'would', 'rush', 'out', 'grab', 'young', 'adult', 'kids', 'level', 'book', 'series', 'promise', 'decent', 'sales', 'figures', 'Nothing', 'wrong', 'business', 'perspective', 'books', 'have', 'built-in', 'audience', 'studios', 'should', 'be', 'reasonable', 'expectation', 'certain', 'level', 'ticket', 'sales', 'real', 'danger', 'can', 'fail', 'horribly', 'movie', 'not', 'adapted', 'well', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'looking', 'down', 'barrel', 'three-to-four', 'book', 'series', 'Franchises', 'will', 'not', 'continue', 'first', 'film', 'fails', 'make', 'off', 'box', 'office', 'launch', 'pad', 'current', 'adaptation', 'looking', 'pick', 'up', 'torch', 'young', 'adult', 'franchise', 'wars.The', 'Mortal', 'Instruments', '8211', 'City', 'Bones', 'first', 'six-book', 'series', 'final', 'book', 'due', 'out', '2014.', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Clary', 'who', 'out', 'mother', 'had', 'dark', 'secret', 'passed', 'down', 'power', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'demons', 'sorts', 'nightmarish', 'legends', 'also', 'people', 'who', 'hunt', 'being', 'recruited', 'group', 'Shadow', 'Hunters', 'Clary', 'help', 'find', 'magical', 'cup', 'person', 'who', 'incredible', 'powers', 'way', 'also', 'must', 'decide', 'where', 'loyalties', 'loves', 'lie', 'real', 'world', 'fantasy', 'world.I', '8217', 'going', 'put', 'right', 'out', 'front', 'far', 'away', 'aboveTwilight', 'pretty', 'much', 'line', 'first', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'film', 'better', 'certain', 'volumes', 'Potter', 'franchise', 'mainly', 'books', 'one', 'two', 'action', 'sequences', 'character', 'design', 'overall', 'scenic', 'look', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'goth', 'kid-cum-demon', 'hunter', 'fun', 'look', 'sort', 'junior', 'version', 'watching', 'Blade', 'trilogy.The', 'casting', 'hopefully', 'long-lasting', 'characters', 'was', 'done', 'care', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'Clary', 'helm', 'young', 'naive', 'fish', 'water', 'definitely', 'certain', 'charm', 'presence', 'on-screen', 'natural', 'are', 'moments', 'here', 'where', 'heavily', 'theRyan', 'Gosling', 'method', 'success', 'just', 'staring', 'off', 'camera', 'deep', 'thought', 'Robert', 'Sheehan', 'best', 'friend', 'Simon', 'human', 'element', 'film', '8217', 's', 'mainly', 'there', 'represent', 'audience', 'one', 'character', 'on-screen', 'give', 'outlet', 'saying', '8220', 'What', 'hell', 'going', 'here', '8221', '8217', 'good', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'Sorcerer', '8217', 's', 'Apprentice', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', '8220', 'well-known', '8221', 'bill', 'playing', 'main', 'villain', 'Valentine', '8217', 'show', 'up', 'last', 'quarter', 'movie', 'giving', 'usual', 'intense', 'performance', 'sort', 'stoicism', 'laced', 'psychotic', 'rage', 'breakout', 'performance', 'here', 'actually', 'Jamie', 'Campbell', 'Bower', 'who', 'possible', 'love', 'interest', 'main', 'Shadow', 'Hunter', 'Jace', 'power', 'camera', 'intensity', 'well', 'Meyers', 'also', 'balance', 'character', 'brash', 'badass', 'playful', 'protagonist', 'always', 'more', 'interesting', 'character.On', 'down', 'side', 'movie', 'curse', '8220', 'story', '8221', 'franchises', 'deal', 'Running', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'set', 'up', 'stories', 'plot', 'lines', 'will', 'continue', 'franchise', 'other', 'movies', 'actually', 'ever', 'get', 'made', 'danger', 'don', '8217', 't', 'make', 'sure', 'make', 'first', 'movie', 'tight', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'will', 'be', 'audience', 'waiting', 'when', 'next', 'chapter', 'around', 'are', 'ton', 'questions', 'scenarios', 'introduced', 'here', 'very', 'few', 'actually', 'tied', 'up', 'movie', 'off', 'long', 'mostly', 'unfinished', 'haven', '8217', 'read', 'books', 'can', '8217', 't', 'say', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'out', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'benefitted', 'more', 'ninety-minute', 'running', 'time', 'more', 'complete', 'accuracy', 'allegiance', 'source', 'material.The', 'Mortal', 'Instruments', '8211', 'City', 'Bones', 'isn', '8217', 'bad', 'curious', 'what', 'next', 'chapter', 'will', 'bring', '8217', 'not', 'convinced', 'chapter', 'set', 'bar', 'high', 'enough', 'call', 'money', 'will', 'take', 'get', 'second', 'one', 'made']",The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones

1591805,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B009AMAKWM,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","Gotta give credit where credit is due. Of all the wannabe Twilight flicks, at least the ones I've seen, this production comes closest to capturing the core essence of that very successful film.Engaging and well acted, I had a very decent time screening this movie. While not broaching any new cinematic ground and the plot pretty much lifted from any number of similar films from Buffy to, again, Twilight - the cast did an excellent job of carving out their own place in the on-going YA battlefield.As the movie opens, we're introduced to beautiful Clary growing up in NYC.And Clary is what's known as a &#34;mundane&#34; - in every respect a normal average human. But there is nothing normal or average about this young woman. In fact, she's a blood descendant of The Shadow Hunters - just like her mother.For reasons unexplained - mom has chosen to obscure her daughter's heritage. By way of an annual warlock pilgrimage, a spell has been cast that keeps Clary's memory repressed and her abilities in check. But upon reaching her late teens, the spell requires more frequent and powerful adjustments. The barrier is showing signs of collapse; she's beginning to see the hidden glyphs and runes emblazoned into the real world.Unfortunately, as Clary begins to see into the shadows, so too the shadows begins to see her. Her recovered abilities exposing her presence to the darkness.Like firing off a flare gun on a dark night - she's been noticed.Her family assaulted, their home violated. She now understands the terrible price for her new insight. Worse, her mom and step-dad are missing. Suddenly, she's under attack from demons, vampires, and ghoulish monsters of all stripes. The warlock gives her a parting warning: The people whom she trusts, the Shadow Hunters, were in fact hunting her mother.As both Light and Dark rediscovers the hidden hunter, both sides maneuver and manipulate in order to control. One way or another - Clary must be &#34;taken&#34;. Facing lies, half-truths and betrayal - friends and enemies become a blur. She no longer knows whom to trust or what her hidden secret will ultimately reveal.Again, no argument, this is a derivative and unapologetic copy of a better original. But because this was also a fun flick with good performances delivered by solid players, and built on an engaging screenplay with very minor plot holes - I'll put away the usual acidic barbs this kind of cookie-cutter production usually generates.Additionally, the special effects were really good. Nothing new, but rather, appropriate. Instead of being done to show off some expensive digital wizardry, Director Harald Zwart used it - as it was always meant to be used - to compliment the story; adding effects only as a highlight to an already engaging tale.Overall, very glad to have taken the time to screen this film. It was not time wasted.Personal Notes:- Could've done without the syrupy arboretum scene. Much too sappy. Though not much better, I prefer the Twilight mountain version.- Very pleased that a favorite actor - Kevin Durand - got a small role in this production. Always good to see a talented performer who, in my estimation, deserves an expanded spotlight in the industry.",4,Good Riff Of Twilight,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,3202,"['Got', 'ta', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'wannabe', 'Twilight', 'flicks', 'least', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'production', 'closest', 'capturing', 'core', 'essence', 'very', 'successful', 'film.Engaging', 'well', 'acted', 'had', 'very', 'decent', 'time', 'screening', 'movie', 'not', 'broaching', 'new', 'cinematic', 'ground', 'plot', 'pretty', 'much', 'lifted', 'number', 'similar', 'films', 'Buffy', 'again', 'Twilight', 'cast', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'carving', 'out', 'own', 'place', 'on-going', 'YA', 'battlefield.As', 'movie', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'beautiful', 'Clary', 'growing', 'up', 'NYC.And', 'Clary', 'what', 'known', '34', 'mundane', '34', 'respect', 'normal', 'average', 'human', 'nothing', 'normal', 'average', 'young', 'woman', 'fact', 'blood', 'descendant', 'Shadow', 'Hunters', 'just', 'mother.For', 'reasons', 'unexplained', 'mom', 'chosen', 'obscure', 'daughter', 'heritage', 'way', 'annual', 'warlock', 'pilgrimage', 'spell', 'been', 'cast', 'Clary', 'memory', 'repressed', 'abilities', 'check', 'reaching', 'late', 'teens', 'spell', 'more', 'frequent', 'powerful', 'adjustments', 'barrier', 'showing', 'signs', 'collapse', 'beginning', 'see', 'hidden', 'glyphs', 'runes', 'emblazoned', 'real', 'world.Unfortunately', 'Clary', 'begins', 'see', 'shadows', 'so', 'too', 'shadows', 'see', 'recovered', 'abilities', 'exposing', 'presence', 'darkness.Like', 'firing', 'off', 'flare', 'gun', 'dark', 'night', 'been', 'noticed.Her', 'family', 'assaulted', 'home', 'violated', 'now', 'terrible', 'price', 'new', 'insight', 'Worse', 'mom', 'step-dad', 'are', 'missing', 'Suddenly', 'attack', 'demons', 'vampires', 'ghoulish', 'monsters', 'stripes', 'warlock', 'parting', 'warning', 'people', 'whom', 'Shadow', 'Hunters', 'were', 'fact', 'hunting', 'mother.As', 'Light', 'Dark', 'hidden', 'hunter', 'sides', 'maneuver', 'manipulate', 'order', 'control', 'One', 'way', 'Clary', 'must', 'be', '34', 'taken', '34', 'Facing', 'lies', 'half-truths', 'betrayal', 'friends', 'become', 'blur', 'no', 'longer', 'whom', 'trust', 'what', 'hidden', 'secret', 'will', 'ultimately', 'reveal.Again', 'argument', 'derivative', 'unapologetic', 'copy', 'better', 'original', 'was', 'also', 'fun', 'flick', 'good', 'performances', 'delivered', 'solid', 'players', 'built', 'engaging', 'screenplay', 'very', 'minor', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'put', 'away', 'usual', 'acidic', 'barbs', 'kind', 'cookie-cutter', 'production', 'usually', 'generates.Additionally', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'Nothing', 'new', 'rather', 'appropriate', 'Instead', 'being', 'done', 'show', 'off', 'expensive', 'digital', 'wizardry', 'Director', 'Harald', 'Zwart', 'used', 'was', 'always', 'meant', 'be', 'used', 'compliment', 'story', 'adding', 'effects', 'only', 'highlight', 'already', 'engaging', 'tale.Overall', 'very', 'glad', 'have', 'taken', 'time', 'screen', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'time', 'wasted.Personal', 'Notes', 'Could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'syrupy', 'arboretum', 'scene', 'Much', 'too', 'sappy', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'prefer', 'Twilight', 'mountain', 'version.-', 'Very', 'pleased', 'favorite', 'actor', 'Kevin', 'Durand', 'got', 'small', 'role', 'production', 'Always', 'good', 'see', 'talented', 'performer', 'who', 'estimation', 'expanded', 'spotlight', 'industry']",The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones

1591811,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B009AMAKWM,Mark Turner,"[3, 4]","Hollywood knows where it makes its money when it comes to theaters. That became apparent with the numbers raked up by the TWILIGHT franchise. Since that series is finished it's time for a new one and what better than another one based on a series of novels, THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS: CITY OF BONES.Clary Fray has been seeing things she can't explain. Signs no one else can read and images of people being murdered that no one else sees. After watching someone killed at a nearby club she returns home to find her mother gone and their apartment trashed. Enter Jace, the killer she saw at the club who explains to her what is going on and offers to help her find her mother.It appears that Clary is descended from a line of Shadowhunters, a group of half human/half angel warriors that have battled evil for generations. Not wanting her to be aware of certain secrets, Clary's mother had a spell cast on her to hide images and knowledge so that no one could get them from her. But with her mother captured Clary isn't sure who to side with or who to trust.Jace and the other Shadowhunters take Clary and her friend Alec in to their secret stronghold. It is there that they begin to tell her about who she is, who her mother was and just who is responsible for kidnapping her and why. Years before Clary's mother was part of a group of Shadowhunters who followed Valentine, a Shadowhunter who decided to use the method once employed to start their kind in the hopes of taking over the world. Clary's mother put a stop to that, stealing the sacred chalice that Valentine needs to accomplish his goal.As the story unfolds it provides plenty of background material for those just coming into the series of stories but not in a way to be boring. Instead we get glimpses of the past of Clary's mother and of Clary herself, bits and pieces revealed to her and us at the same time. The story moves forward and alliances develop as does a love interest between Clary and Jace, much to the chagrin of Alec who has long been in love with Clary. Can you say Team Edward and Team Jacob?But honestly that would be short selling this movie (and my guess the series of books on which it was based) which does offer something different and, for me at least, a bit more fulfilling than sparkly vampires. These Shadowhunters are fierce warriors willing to take on a room filled with truly hideous vampires in an effort to protect Clary. Their weapons are old school but don't let that fool you as they take on all comers with nary a drop of their own blood spilled.The special effects are done to perfection here but yes of course they are CGI (Computer Generated Images) more often than not. At least they've made the effort to make them seem real as opposed to poorly done CGI (see any monster of the week effort on SyFy for an example of bad CGI). The heroics are nicely done and by the end of the film you find yourself hoping that more of the series will follow.That may not happen as the movie's release didn't garner the attention or numbers that the TWILIGHT crowd displayed.

It's a teen movie with beautiful and tragic young creatures, one in particular finds herself drawing the same symbol over and over again and when her mother is attacked by demons she discovers that the world isn't what she thought and neither is she.As I've already mentioned this is a teen movie and one based upon a familiar template, so we have smoldering looks, emo teenagers who don't fit in with the rest of the world and a supernatural that is glossier than it should be. Nothing too original you might think and of the face of it you'd be right, however it does have some good things going for it.The first is that for a gang of attractive and emo youngsters they're actually not bad, sure there's a few moments where you roll your eyes, but the story gets going quickly and keeps moving all the way through. The second is that the support cast contains a number of well worn faces and add some depth to the film, don't get me wrong its fairly throw away entertainment, but entertaining nonetheless.It's also a decent action film and while it does have the slightly glamorous supernatural side it also has its dark side and some of the demons are quite nasty and look pretty cool.

1591819,A307Y5TTLG6H4X,B009AMAKWM,"Me ""Mrs. Book Worm""","[12, 24]","I love Cassandra Clare. I buy every book she writes as soon as it's available. Her stories are beautiful and captivating and intriguing.This movie was none of those things.The actors were all over the place. Some overacted every scene, showing way more emotion than the lines called for. It felt like an over-reaching high school production. There were no subtleties at all. It all felt forced. The lines that I loved in the book were delivered at the wrong timing or the wrong tone. (I realize I am extremely picky with this, but it's important.) The actors who weren't over doing every scene were just so awful, my husband and I were scoffing and rolling our eyes at everything they said. Case in point: Magnus Bane, who is the most charismatic and beautiful character in all the books, delivered every single word in monotone. Every. Single. Word. It was sad.The music was horrendous. It sounded as if they took it all from a play book on ""How to make a Dramatic Soundtrack."" only it was in all the wrong places. It sounded forced as well. It was distracting to the scenes.The direction was laughable. Actor walks in, takes two steps around characters so that he's facing the screen. Who walks into a room and walks around people to talk to them? No one. The camera work should have made up for that. They could have taken some points from The Hunger Games, which did most of their camera work and direction in a way that it felt natural and real.The dialogue and plot were rushed and put into contexts that made no sense. I do appreciate that they used lines straight from the book, but the way that they were used seemed awkward and wrong, and I know I'm using this word a lot, but also very forced. Example: Simon tells Clary he had hoped that when he tells a girl he loves him, she would say it back - while they're right outside of the hospital room where her mother lies in a coma. If I hadn't read the books, I'd be wondering why this Simon putz was so worried about his own feelings while the girl he loved was fretting over her mother's health. Another example: Simon, Jace, and Clary are in Clary's demolished apartment. No one knows where Clary's mother is. Simon starts digging on Jace. Jace comes back with a funny quip. It's in the book, yes, but not at a pivotal time when Clary is losing her mind over her mother's welfare! There are reasons that lines need to be delivered at certain times: they need to be believable! It felt like the screen writers were just shoving quotes in where they could. It wasn't natural. The way that the Shadowhunters' history and details were explained sounded trite and stupid.The storyline was rushed and jumbled. We didn't get a chance to get a feel for the characters before total chaos took over and then we still didn't really get to know them throughout the movie. (I'm going to not make judgements on the actors apperances and whether they fit their rolls or not. Everyone has their own image of what Jace and Clary and Simon and all the others look like.)I understand that a movie adapted from a book is challenging. Some movies get it right (Stand By Me, Hunger Games, the later Twilight movies) and some just completely fumble the ball. For me, this was an absolute miss. They completely left out the heart of the book in this adaptation. I feel badly for Cassandra Clare, and I will not be viewing any subsequent movies, but I will continue to read her books.The only good points for me: The demon dog (even though it wasn't like the book's demon, it was pretty creepy and made me jump), Isabelle's whip, Luke and the actor who played Luke (I take back what I said about over acting. I think he did the best job of all of them), the believably of the apartment size, and the woman who played Clary's mother.",1,"Trite, stupid, not even close.",1377993600,"09 1, 2013",2013,3769,"['love', 'Cassandra', 'Clare', 'buy', 'book', 'as', 'soon', 'available', 'stories', 'are', 'beautiful', 'captivating', 'intriguing.This', 'movie', 'was', 'none', 'things.The', 'actors', 'were', 'place', 'overacted', 'scene', 'showing', 'way', 'more', 'emotion', 'lines', 'called', 'felt', 'over-reaching', 'high', 'school', 'production', 'were', 'subtleties', 'felt', 'forced', 'lines', 'loved', 'book', 'were', 'delivered', 'wrong', 'timing', 'wrong', 'tone', 'realize', 'am', 'extremely', 'picky', 'important', 'actors', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'doing', 'scene', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'awful', 'husband', 'were', 'scoffing', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'everything', 'said', 'Case', 'point', 'Magnus', 'Bane', 'who', 'most', 'charismatic', 'beautiful', 'character', 'books', 'delivered', 'single', 'word', 'monotone', 'Every', 'Single', 'Word', 'was', 'sad.The', 'music', 'was', 'horrendous', 'sounded', 'took', 'play', 'book', 'How', 'make', 'Dramatic', 'Soundtrack', 'only', 'was', 'wrong', 'places', 'sounded', 'forced', 'well', 'was', 'distracting', 'scenes.The', 'direction', 'was', 'laughable', 'Actor', 'walks', 'two', 'steps', 'characters', 'so', 'facing', 'screen', 'Who', 'walks', 'room', 'walks', 'around', 'people', 'talk', 'one', 'camera', 'work', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'up', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'points', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'did', 'most', 'camera', 'work', 'direction', 'way', 'felt', 'natural', 'real.The', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'were', 'rushed', 'put', 'contexts', 'made', 'sense', 'do', 'appreciate', 'used', 'lines', 'straight', 'book', 'way', 'were', 'used', 'seemed', 'awkward', 'wrong', 'know', ""'m"", 'using', 'word', 'lot', 'also', 'very', 'forced', 'Example', 'Simon', 'Clary', 'had', 'hoped', 'when', 'girl', 'would', 'say', 'back', ""'re"", 'right', 'hospital', 'room', 'where', 'mother', 'coma', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', ""'d"", 'be', 'wondering', 'why', 'Simon', 'putz', 'was', 'so', 'worried', 'own', 'feelings', 'girl', 'loved', 'was', 'fretting', 'mother', 'health', 'example', 'Simon', 'Jace', 'Clary', 'are', 'Clary', 'demolished', 'apartment', 'one', 'where', 'Clary', 'mother', 'Simon', 'digging', 'Jace', 'Jace', 'back', 'funny', 'quip', 'book', 'yes', 'not', 'pivotal', 'time', 'when', 'Clary', 'losing', 'mind', 'mother', 'welfare', 'are', 'reasons', 'lines', 'need', 'be', 'delivered', 'certain', 'times', 'need', 'be', 'believable', 'felt', 'screen', 'writers', 'were', 'just', 'shoving', 'quotes', 'where', 'could', 'was', ""n't"", 'natural', 'way', 'Shadowhunters', 'history', 'details', 'were', 'explained', 'sounded', 'trite', 'stupid.The', 'storyline', 'was', 'rushed', 'jumbled', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'get', 'feel', 'characters', 'total', 'chaos', 'took', 'over', 'then', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'know', 'movie', ""'m"", 'going', 'not', 'make', 'judgements', 'actors', 'apperances', 'fit', 'rolls', 'not', 'Everyone', 'own', 'image', 'what', 'Jace', 'Clary', 'Simon', 'others', 'look', 'understand', 'movie', 'adapted', 'book', 'challenging', 'movies', 'get', 'right', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'later', 'Twilight', 'movies', 'just', 'completely', 'fumble', 'ball', 'was', 'absolute', 'miss', 'completely', 'left', 'out', 'heart', 'book', 'adaptation', 'feel', 'badly', 'Cassandra', 'Clare', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'viewing', 'subsequent', 'movies', 'will', 'continue', 'read', 'books.The', 'only', 'good', 'points', 'demon', 'dog', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'book', 'demon', 'was', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'made', 'jump', 'Isabelle', 'whip', 'Luke', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Luke', 'take', 'back', 'what', 'said', 'acting', 'think', 'did', 'best', 'job', 'believably', 'apartment', 'size', 'woman', 'who', 'played', 'Clary', 'mother']",The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones

1591826,A1NIC6Z33PSMYX,B009AMAKWM,Modern Girl,"[11, 15]","Overall, I really enjoyed this movie.The casting was perfect.  The actors really embodied their character-counterparts and brought them to life.  Jace was just as overconfident and funny in the books, and Simon was SPOT-ON! He looked and acted exactly how I pictured him in my head.  I will admit, I was sort of disappointed in Magnus - I was expecting more sparkle, but I suppose he did OK.I really appreciated that the storyline and plot was swift without feeling rushed.  Anyone who hasn't read the books would have an easy time following the story.  They didn't go as in-depth on the shadowhunter history, but they touched on all the highlights that were important to the story for everyone to understand even if they didn't read the books.I like that they sometimes went ""off script"" from the book sometimes.  For example, I liked the way they flipped the sequence of the poetry reading and the club.  It somehow made more sense to me that way.  I thought it was hilarious when Simon met Jace and he asked if he was the gatekeeper and alluded to the keymaster (from the original Ghostbusters movie).  I felt that it gave the movie a funny & ironic twist.Another thing I liked about going off-book-script was the whole ""rat scene"" that was omitted from the movie that was in the book.  I realize the importance of that part in the book, but I think the CGI execution of that would have been ridiculous, so I'm glad they didn't go through with it.There were a few things that weren't my favorite:* I didn't like that they gave away some information in this first movie that didn't come out until later books (2 & 3).  I suppose it isn't a HUGE deal, but when I was reading the books I remember thinking ""OMG ! THAT'S what's wrong with Clary's mom!!!"" or finding out what Valentine really did to Clary & Jace before they were born. Minor details, but they irked me nonetheless.* Magnus was kind of boring.  When he was talking to Clary at the party, I felt like he was reading the book to me.Despite that, I REALLY enjoyed the movie - even with the ""twist"" ending. I've heard that the City of Ashes movie has been shelved ""indefinitely"" because this movie hasn't been a blow-away box office hit, but I really hope they pursue filming City of Ashes.

1591830,A24314ZRNRP70B,B009AMAKWM,Movie Goer,"[1, 2]","The film:  'Mortal Instruments, City of Bones' is based upon a series of books by the fantasy Author Cassandra Clare. The movie carries the audience into the world of the Shadowhunters, humans endowed with Angelic powers given to them along with the charge of protecting the mundane world from the forces of evil they are to blind to recognize.The book centers around Clarissa [Clary] the daughter of Valentine Morgenstren and Jocelyn Fairchild, who's last name was changed to Fray in order to protect her from her Shadowhunter inheritance for as long as possible. However, as destinies usually do, eventually Clary's destiny caught up with her. While that premise might seem just a little cliche, sometimes we are comfortable revisiting plots and classic storylines such as good versus evil, and the underdog David versus Goliath. The author deals with these topics so familiar in the genre with class, and a fresh engaging plot that never lets up in action.The best part of the move however is that the actress Lily Collins delivers a slightly vulnerable, slightly sensual, and slightly butt kicking heroine that modern day literature just needs a little more of. In a film genre dominated by the same tall dark and hansome hero with a beautiful girl on his arm [or sometimes one on each arm] it is refreshing to see more and more author's breaking free of the trend, and creating compelling female characters.

I had similar feelings about Twilight and now Vampire Academy coming out. IMO, I think the only book series that really adapted ""well"" to the big screen were Harry Potter and the Hunger Games series and I'm sure even those had their complaints.I have NOT read these books and decided to give the movie a try anyway since I love supernatural/adventure books. Without having read the books and watching it as an entertaining new movie series I found myself very entertained. I loved the characters, I think the actors did an overall good job and for the most part I felt like the movie was good. The movie actually made me go out and buy the books because I wanted to know what else I was missing and what is going to happen to these characters. I really had no negative feelings about the movie and thought it was pretty good.However, when you read a book it's like your baby and you imagine it to be one way and when the adaptation is not, it's easy to find yourself disappointed. I would say that if you can be open minded and just want something to watch, give it a chance. I personally liked this movie better than Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters which was okay too.Edited on January 16th, 2014:A few days after writing this review I received my copy of City of Bones and read the whole book. After reading the book and comparing it closely with the movie I can honestly say this movie is an amazing adaptation of this book. Many of the lines are verbatim to the book and sequence of events. With a few changes here and there which I think ultimately improved the movie. Some of the locations/where the events occur are different but very few. Jace's character was a bit different as well in the beginning but it didn't really make a big difference for me. I would say about 90% of the book is accurate to the movie. The only aspect of the movie I would have changed at this point was the romance scene. It wasn't like the scene in the book was all that romantic and detailed either but the sprinklers in the movie was an unnecessary add-on. It could have been more romantic/naturally done. Overall, if you didn't read the books you're not missing much. The movie is a great adaptation of the storyline and in my opinion I actually prefer it's direction over the book. I hope that helps!

1591840,A14SRB2VNHKO3J,B009AMAKWM,"Nikki Kasakitis ""Nikki @ Foil the Plot""","[32, 48]","So if you haven't heard, there's been some buzz about The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones... and most of it's not good. As is usually the case with popular YA series-gone-to-film, I'm guessing much of this comes from the series' die-hard fan base. Since I was less than impressed with the book (my review), I'm going to try and take a more objective look at the movie. I walked in to The Mortal Instruments with the hope that it would blow the book out of the water. I mean, c'mon, did you see that trailer?! It looked SO good! And while I did enjoy the film overall, it didn't wow me as much as I thought it would.There were definitely deviations from the book, as can be expected, but for the most part, I liked what they did with it. Sure, they cut out a lot of background history on the Shadowhunters and their world, but can you really blame them there? It's a movie and most moviegoers want to see some action. So yeah, they skipped a bunch of mythology to get to all the kick-ass parts and I'm cool with that. It's an easy movie to follow for those who aren't so familiar with the series, but I can see where it would be a more difficult adjustment for loyal fans of the books. For me, the changes didn't really matter so much because they worked. I think the biggest change was where the end battle took place and I do question how they'll make that fit in future movies (if there are any).What I did appreciate were the subtle nuances to things in the book that were otherwise omitted. Where I think it lacked was in the fact that it was missing much of the mysterious darkness that the book had. It felt too rushed and we weren't able to get that real, gritty NYC feeling. I also really wanted more from that whole vampire/werewolf fight scene. It was one of my favourite parts of the book. I was also a bummed about how they handled that WTF revelation at the end --- it felt like they sugar-coated it so that it lost a lot of its WTF-ness. Not cool because that's what really made the book stand out.As far as the casting goes, I thought most of the main characters (Clary, Simon, Jace, Hodge & Clary's mum) were spot on. First off, I LOOOOOVED Simon. He was a total natural --- relatable and cute and dorky and friendly. Lilly Collins was beautiful and brought a lot of depth to Clary. Jace didn't look quite like I pictured but he played the serious yet snarky role quite well. Jamie Campbell Bower looks like more of a heroine-chic version of the Jace that's in my head. It's nice to finally see Lena Headey not be a total b*tch and Jared Harris always keeps it classy. I thought Magnus looked the part but the acting was SO forced. It was just bad. I'm a give or take on Valentine and Luke. They weren't what I imagined but they were do-able. The biggest casting issue I had was with Alec and Isabelle. For the two most beautiful characters (in the book), I thought Clary and Simon outshined them both. And maybe I'm just being picky here, but aren't they supposed to look 17 not 30?Overall, I'd say the movie was pleasing. The action was terrific, the romance believable (probably because Collins and Bowen dated in real life) and most of the casting was great, but I do think they can do one better if there's a sequel. The movie had a few cheesy moments (greenhouse sappy scene, I'm looking at you!), some intense drama, offered up some laughs and provided some legitimately creepy moments. Don't get me wrong, I can see why fans were displeased but if you hadn't read the books, I think the movie is a good alternative.  My recommendation if you are a fan is to not take the movie too seriously, otherwise you'll probably feel the bitter taste of disappointment.Food for Thought: The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones has gotten a lot of flack for not living up to the book but I kind of liked the movie. The casting was fairly well-done, with a few exceptions, and the plot was action-tastic!

1591860,A1FDW7IHT1J9QD,B009AMAKWM,"Robyn Facchiano ""Mighty Reader""","[1, 1]","While I did enjoy this movie I was saddened to see just how much is wrong with it. I, unlike some of the people I know, hadn't read any of the books so I was going in fresh and new.The story is fantastic, the characters are perfect and yet as I read the book after having seen the movie twice now,  I must say that they could have done a much better job in the telling. While our characters and the people who portray them match up very well there are some issues with the changes with most seeming small but can cast a long and dark shadow.Jace is exactly right as he is portrayed by Jamie Campbell Bower, full of longing and anger and all consuming grief. His physical appearance is spot on I must say and although I do believe he is just TOO pretty he certainly needs to be. (No spoilers here)Clary is a whiner who just cannot bring herself to care anything about her mom until it's too late and even then, well. I just hope that for all of their sake that she learns how to fight and stand on her own two feet. Lily Collins has the looks of Clary and some of her manners but only in that she seems to pout a lot and never is all that happy unless she's with Jace.  In her constant worry for Simon who just wants Clary to notice him she seems selfish and unfeeling toward anyone who isn't Jace.Simon played by Robert Sheehan is annoyingly sweet, clingy and pouty but I found myself rooting for him in his hopeless quest for Clary's affection even after he is saved by her and the shadow hunters he still has his optimism full of wonder and painful longing.Alec and Isabelle, the brother and sister who try and keep Jace on a leash when they can that is.I believe that Alec is another character portrayed exactly right in looks and temperment. He is played really well by Kevin Zegers and I have high hopes that when the second movie is done he better have more on screen time. It's Alec's quiet devotion and sad wanting of Jace that makes you feel for him especially after his not so subtle keep away neon sign directed at Clary.Isabelle is the sister that both Alec and Jace deserve, she is strong and will suffer no fools. Her flaws are being too serious about the things she doesn't need to be serious about and her fun side isn't fun when it's appropriate to be.  Jemima West plays Isabelle very well in that she enjoys being a female among boys but she also seems very glad of Clary's company as she states she hates being the only girl.As for Valentine played by the always sexy Johnathan Rhys Meyers I just wish they would have gotten the HAIR right!  I mean he couldn't just have worn a wig or colored his hair??  Other then that I am sooo very glad to have Valentine be such a hardened warrior with the stellar acting chops that Meyers always brings to his roles. Especially one such as his current project, Dracula and his previous Henry the Eighth. I believe that these particular roles lend a certain heck yeah to his performance as Valentine, the evillishy handsome shadow hunter.Jocelyn our actual hero, played by Lena Headey, is believable as Clary's mom in looks and bad attitude. Jocelyn should have prepared her daughter better not hidden everything from her until it was convienent and necessary.

For you older guys out there, make sure you take a bag with you as I discovered my theater doesn't take kindly to hurling chunks. Like Twilight, the film is designed for the female tween audience. Clary (Lily Collins) rhymes with Carrie (Fisher) and reminds us of clairvoyance, is the main teen character. She can see things her friend Simon (Robert Sheehan) can not, especially that symbol that looks like the head of a deranged bunny.One day Clary comes home to find mom (Lena Headey) left a mess and a demonic attack dog. Her life now consists of hanging out with a goth half angelic being (Jamie Campbell Bower), trying to find out who she is, rediscovering her powers, killing the beings Kristen Stewart would rather procreate with, and something about a cup. There is no Bella in this film, just an Isabelle. Could we please get off the Bella Donna word play.The film is a culmination of pop culture designed to appeal to young female fans. All others beware of nausea. Keep an eye on Clary's hair part as it magically changes aka Deb in &#34;Napoleon Dynamite.&#34;On a side note: Both Lily Collins (Mirror, Mirror) and Kristen Stewart (Snow White and the Huntsman) both played the role of Snow White.

1591891,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B009AMAKWM,Todd Smith,"[2, 2]","For those of you who didn't read the book, City of Bones, this movie may seem a bit confusing to you. This film is kind of like a cliff notes version of the book. Certainly they had to cut things out of the nearly 500 page novel, but some key moments are simply touched upon with a line or two, making the movie a bit confusing at times. Clary Fray (Lily Collins) is a seemingly normal girl, who for some reason can't stop drawing a symbol. When she starts asking about the symbol, she is pulled into a world she never knew existed. As it turns out, Clary is keeping secrets, secrets she doesn't even know she has. It's those secrets that will eventually put her life, and the lives of everyone she knows, in danger. At first, the two main characters seem like they are completely different and won't have any chemistry at all, but as time goes on, they learn they're more alike than they think. Once their on the same page, the story really takes off. Lily Collins (Abduction, The Blind Side) really takes hold of her character and gives the film a strong female lead, that rivals Katniss Everdeen. Collins is paired with British heart-throb, Jamie Campbell Bower, who is a lot more than eye candy. I'd never seen Bower in anything, except bit parts in Twilight and Harry Potter, but the guy has some serious fighting skills. Bower is another one who at first doesn't seem to fit, but in the end really helps to make this film something special. To answer the big question about City of Bones, no, it is not as good as the book and you really shouldn't have expected it to be. The novel is massive and has entire parts that simply couldn't be transferred to the big screen. Some things were left out that shouldn't have been, while some of the more fast paced scenes were extended for the screen. All in all, I thought this movie was a pretty good representation of an excellent novel and a great film to include in your next movie night.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,1939,"['who', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'City', 'Bones', 'movie', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'confusing', 'film', 'kind', 'cliff', 'version', 'book', 'Certainly', 'had', 'cut', 'things', 'nearly', '500', 'page', 'novel', 'key', 'moments', 'are', 'simply', 'touched', 'line', 'two', 'making', 'movie', 'bit', 'confusing', 'times', 'Clary', 'Fray', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'girl', 'who', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'drawing', 'symbol', 'When', 'asking', 'symbol', 'pulled', 'world', 'never', 'knew', 'existed', 'out', 'Clary', 'keeping', 'secrets', 'secrets', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'secrets', 'will', 'eventually', 'put', 'life', 'lives', 'everyone', 'danger', 'first', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'seem', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'chemistry', 'time', 'learn', ""'re"", 'more', 'alike', 'think', 'Once', 'same', 'page', 'story', 'really', 'off', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'Abduction', 'Blind', 'Side', 'really', 'hold', 'character', 'film', 'strong', 'female', 'lead', 'rivals', 'Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'Collins', 'paired', 'British', 'heart-throb', 'Jamie', 'Campbell', 'Bower', 'who', 'lot', 'more', 'eye', 'candy', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'Bower', 'anything', 'bit', 'parts', 'Twilight', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'guy', 'serious', 'fighting', 'skills', 'Bower', 'one', 'who', 'first', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'end', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'something', 'special', 'answer', 'big', 'question', 'City', 'Bones', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'expected', 'be', 'novel', 'massive', 'entire', 'parts', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'transferred', 'big', 'screen', 'things', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fast', 'paced', 'scenes', 'were', 'extended', 'screen', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'representation', 'excellent', 'novel', 'great', 'film', 'include', 'next', 'movie', 'night']",The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones

She also gets romantically involved with someone with supernatural abilities &#8211; in her case a &#8220;Shadowhunter&#8221; Jace Wayland (Jamie Campbell Bower) &#8211; before fighting enemies using her newly acquired powers.This is a classic way of weaving an adventure story, especially that of young adult novel, and there is nothing wrong with that itself. What is wrong with &#8220;The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones&#8221; is that, while borrowing so many things from other movies of the genre, Harald Zwart&#8217;s gothic fantasy film gives us nothing new in terms of story or characters. (Or maybe worse, because I didn&#8217;t find Lily Collins&#8217; self-absorbed heroine very attractive).Familiarity is not exactly a bad thing as long as the film gives us something else, like nice action and humor, interesting characters or anything. &#8220;The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones&#8221; doesn&#8217;t have much to offer. Actors are all fine, but action scenes (with lots of CGI) are generic. While the story is set in New York City, the film hardly looks that way.So what do we get?

Upon watching the movie I went on-line and moved the Book Series from my &#34;wish list&#34; to my shopping cart.

The movie is faster paced and some of the side stories we get from the text are not delivered in the movie but a movie will never have all of the detail a printed novel has, if it did one film might turn out to be as much as 10 hours long!I personally loved the movie, no spoilers here but I am curious to see how the second installment fills in the gaps and completes the story changes where the first film and first book are different. I enjoyed the actors and the only character I found truly off (but not disappointingly so) was Isabelle, Jenna is beautiful and talented she's just not exactly the powerful almost Amazonian figure I was anticipating from reading about Izzy in the books.

1591897,AFAXFOMYR8V2G,B009AMAKWM,"Voila ""Voila""","[1, 2]","Wow, I really like this film. I've had to rewind thrice to fill context, literally thrice from the end and once from the middle of the film. This two hour and ten minute film lacks context and I've learned this is part of a massive vetted series of immaculate, very much admired books, 5 that are out now, 21 November 2013, a sixth book is released summer 2014 and there are 3 prequels. After I posted the movie's fully developed characters within the first 20 minutes of the film, I learned of this massive series of books as well as learned that many of my friends adore the series and own this film already. In my words, I'd say this film is brilliant and unique, though, the context of the sentences from the book may be required prior to watching the film and I imagine that reading the book prior to the movie is even more thrilling than just one or the other. Not having read the books, the context between the lines from the many characters are filled easily however with two hours and ten minutes, there is not one moment of lapses for any viewer. I've viewed quite a lot of films in this genre, which is a split-genre- in my opinion- having viewed so many super natural genre films, I can become, unbeknownst to me, a tad jaded in the midst of watching, knowing what the formula is and what the writers created when mixing formulas. This film is beyond a set formula, said to be based upon short books that are quick reads and most lines in the film are word-for-word from the respective book.

Children of a dysfunctional family that reunite and fix things is not very satisfying.  Perhaps children of broken homes will find more in common with the story, but it fell flat for me.  Other than that, it was interesting seeing them piece things together and wonder the streets of the hidden city sites.

1591899,A1JV1FA7LCDDA3,B009AMAKWM,Wendell Best,"[0, 1]","It was actually a decent movie especially if your into fantasy genre. Definitely a teenage girl coming of age movie with the mysterious pretty boy introducing her to a world she never knew, sound familiar? I think the plot pulls from a lot of other stories, a young girl whose memories are blocked, a mother who has kept her past a secret, a faithful friend of the family who is a secret guardian, and the unfortunate circumstances that lead to the mother not telling the daughter the truth before everything starts catching up to them, and it falls on the daughter to figure everything out about what happened, discovering new powers she never had before, and saving the day. Typical fantasy story lines and possibly why the movie didn't do so well because it has been told before. I think there was a lot of possibilities with the elements of the story, but I kept thinking how it reminded me of the whole Twilight story of the girl falling in love with the mysterious stranger and completely oblivious to the affections of the childhood friend even to the point of rejecting him completely. I kind of thought that was weird to do, especially when the love interest turns out to be her brother.",3,Can we say Twilight Spin Off?,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,1196,"['was', 'actually', 'decent', 'movie', 'especially', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'Definitely', 'teenage', 'girl', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'mysterious', 'pretty', 'boy', 'introducing', 'world', 'never', 'knew', 'sound', 'familiar', 'think', 'plot', 'pulls', 'lot', 'other', 'stories', 'young', 'girl', 'memories', 'are', 'blocked', 'mother', 'who', 'kept', 'past', 'secret', 'faithful', 'friend', 'family', 'who', 'secret', 'guardian', 'unfortunate', 'circumstances', 'lead', 'mother', 'not', 'telling', 'daughter', 'truth', 'everything', 'starts', 'catching', 'up', 'daughter', 'figure', 'everything', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'discovering', 'new', 'powers', 'never', 'had', 'saving', 'day', 'Typical', 'fantasy', 'story', 'lines', 'possibly', 'why', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'well', 'been', 'told', 'think', 'was', 'lot', 'possibilities', 'elements', 'story', 'kept', 'thinking', 'how', 'reminded', 'whole', 'Twilight', 'story', 'girl', 'falling', 'love', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'affections', 'childhood', 'friend', 'even', 'point', 'rejecting', 'completely', 'kind', 'thought', 'was', 'weird', 'do', 'especially', 'when', 'love', 'interest', 'out', 'be', 'brother']",The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones

But the plot is so much like Twilight that it turns me off.  You have a love triangle between the special girl, a half-angel, and a geeky guy who might or might not become a vampire.  A gay half-angel who loves the other probably-bisexual half-angel.  The boys are as pretty as the girls.  You have instant love and flirting--in a time of war and fearful happenings, by the way.  Bloodless battles that are infuriating to watch.  Werewolves that look just like the overgrown dogs in Twilight.  And so on.There is some fun action here, as well as a few cool monsters.  But the mushy, emotional, bad-romance-novel plot just washes away what could have been an interesting urban horror film.  The bloodless fights turn this into a laugh-fest when it is supposed to be taken seriously.  Sorry, but when you impale someone on a sword or a giant wolf bites someone's torso or a character is tortured THERE WILL BE BLOOD.The beginning is quite good, but it develops into a pre-teen dream world.
