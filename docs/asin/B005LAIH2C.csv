1466730,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B005LAIH2C,Ace Reader,"[21, 25]","Ready for a witch punching good time!? Then this action-packed film is for you. Parent's should BEWARE! This film is rated (R) for a reason. It's a bloody, violent, gore-fest with many F-Bombs throughout it's entirety. For adult's this is fine if you don't mind swearing and all of the above. There is also several brief scenes of female nudity, back and front view. This film is a twisted spin on the well known fairy-tale Hansel & Gretel by Han Christian Anderson. Only this time the kids are grown up and know how to use guns, battle axe's, and way cool crossbows that can turn, point and shoot in two different directions. (I want one!)Witches are stealing children from the local community and the towns people are in a panic. They want their kids back. Hansel & Gretel are skilled bounty hunters who specialize in hunting and killing witches. The towns mayor hires them to find the missing children because it's suspected local evil witches must have kidnapped them for evil purposes. Hansel & Gretel are very good at their job and enjoy it. These siblings are feisty and tough having no trouble kicking a witches broom out from under her. They soon discover the children have been stolen for an impending blood moon sacrifice. They must save the children before it's too late.This witchy wild ride is filled to the brim with excellent (CGI) special effects. At times this film is choppy. It doesn't flow as well as it should. Even so, Director Tommy Wirkola has banged out a fun and crazy popcorn munching good time with entertaining solid acting from all of his talented actors. Jeremy Renner (who played Hawkeye in ""The Avengers""), leads this cast as the daring Hansel. English actress Gemma Arterton (who played Princess Tamina in ""The Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time""), is his aggressive sister Gretel, and Dutch actress Famke Janssen (who played Liam Neeson's wife Lenore in Taken 1 & 2), is the evil leader of the witches who you can see relishes playing her part as Muriel. This films score is composed by Corey Allen Jackson.I enjoyed this film, but it's a one time view for me. This is not my kind of film. It may be yours. Recommended with reservations.

1466738,ATHNYP7D3RW1A,B005LAIH2C,A. Gavin,"[0, 0]","OMG, someone finally ripped off Van Helsing! Actually, more like  mated it with The Man with the Iron Fists. Lest it not be clear, I loathed Van Helsing. It is, in my humble opinion, one of the worst big budget films of all time. Hansel & Gretel is actually better. Not a lot better mind you, but watchable in a sort of horrifying way.At least it feels like a single unified ""vision."" Cough cough. The film is consistent in tone. But what a strange tone! In some ways, it's a faithful spawn of the original fairy tale (or Satan), but it steals from and mashes in every conceivable bit of jazzed up bad video game / comic sensibility and time period, over-the-top and almost post-modern humor, then goes for the utter gusto.Some interesting (and terrifying) observations about the film: It apparently cost only $50 million to make. Actually fairly cheap given the number of sets and constant fx shots. They clearly didn't spend the money on the stars. We all know Jeremy Renner to be under a curse that magically compels him to take every role offered. On the scary side H&G; did over $200 million worldwide and a sequel is in production. Spare us now!Probably the thing that most offends me is the fundamental tonal blend. At some level, one might consider this a horror film, and there is a creepy ass story that could be made out of the original fairy tale. If you lost the we-already-know-it intro and immersed us in a dark forest period village where children were being murdered and the townsfolk turned upon themselves -- that could have worked. But H&G; eschews subtlety at any and all levels. The scenario makes a high level sense (i.e. you can mostly follow the ""plot""), but the world building does not. Where is this? When is this? It looks like a 19th century -- no maybe 17th -- village. But we have half-indestructible heroes, more witches than children, machine-gun crossbows, multi-stage bullets, witches better at high-wire hand to hand combat than curses, love-struct trolls, and so much more. It's just plain bizarre. There is even this major scene in the middle where a rape  and a fumbling love encounter are intercut. Woah! And weird.Unlike its putrescent progenitor, Van Helsing, I think H&G; actually leans on sets instead of CGI for the locations. They  filmed it in Germany. This leant (some) of the backgrounds a slightly realistic touch, if a bit Grim Brothers Kitsch. The post-300  costumes and props -- not so much. Also very hit or miss is the flip dialog, mostly consisting of Gretel's one liners and ham-handed exposition aimed at explaining what passes for plot. The witchy plan is so laughable that I wonder if the outline wasn't done by the writer's eight year-old son: Wait for Blood Moon, grab twelve kids (for sacrifice), plus dine on heart of Great White Whale (wait, didn't I mean Witch?).You might wonder why I mentioned The Man with the Iron Fists, even though it's an entirely different action sub-genre. But both films take a similar (and oddball) approach at amping and aping the conventions of their betters. They place wire-flying blood-spurting quip-shouting action at the forefront, forgetting that this is meaningless if you don't actually have characters you care about. Or a world that makes sense. And both films have this Tarantino inspired tone that forbades any suspension of disbelief -- while failing to understand any of the stylistic talents of the master.Oh yes, and shall we mention that it's pretty damn gory. Mixed in with all the camp, there are some horrific deaths here, which further lends to the incredibly odd stylistic tone. Toss into that the haphazard attempt to give both leads romantic interests. Wow, this creates some skin crawling awfulness. I didn't know who to be me more uncomfortable for: the writers, producers, actors, characters, or just me! That intercut rape scene. Shiver. Not like it's ""the ear scene"" in Reservoir Dogs or anything, but the clash of elements is so startlingly inappropriate, I don't even know what to say.If this is the new normal, shoot me with a gatling crossbow now!Andy Gavin, author of The Darkening Dream and Untimed",2,Van Helsing eat your heart out!,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,4128,"['OMG', 'someone', 'finally', 'ripped', 'off', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'Actually', 'more', 'mated', 'Man', 'Iron', 'Fists', 'Lest', 'not', 'be', 'clear', 'loathed', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'humble', 'opinion', 'one', 'worst', 'big', 'budget', 'films', 'time', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'actually', 'better', 'Not', 'lot', 'better', 'mind', 'watchable', 'sort', 'horrifying', 'way.At', 'least', 'single', 'unified', 'vision', 'Cough', 'cough', 'film', 'consistent', 'tone', 'what', 'strange', 'tone', 'ways', 'faithful', 'spawn', 'original', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Satan', 'mashes', 'conceivable', 'bit', 'jazzed', 'up', 'bad', 'video', 'game', '/', 'comic', 'sensibility', 'time', 'period', 'over-the-top', 'almost', 'post-modern', 'humor', 'then', 'utter', 'gusto.Some', 'interesting', 'terrifying', 'observations', 'film', 'apparently', 'cost', 'only', '50', 'million', 'make', 'Actually', 'fairly', 'cheap', 'given', 'number', 'sets', 'constant', 'fx', 'shots', 'clearly', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'money', 'stars', 'know', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'be', 'curse', 'magically', 'take', 'role', 'offered', 'scary', 'side', 'H', 'G', 'did', '200', 'million', 'worldwide', 'sequel', 'production', 'Spare', 'now', 'Probably', 'thing', 'most', 'offends', 'fundamental', 'tonal', 'blend', 'level', 'one', 'might', 'consider', 'horror', 'film', 'creepy', 'ass', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'original', 'fairy', 'tale', 'lost', 'we-already-know-it', 'intro', 'immersed', 'dark', 'forest', 'period', 'village', 'where', 'children', 'were', 'being', 'murdered', 'townsfolk', 'turned', 'upon', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'H', 'G', 'subtlety', 'levels', 'scenario', 'high', 'level', 'sense', 'i.e', 'can', 'mostly', 'follow', 'plot', 'world', 'building', 'not', 'Where', 'When', '19th', 'century', 'maybe', '17th', 'village', 'have', 'half-indestructible', 'heroes', 'more', 'witches', 'children', 'machine-gun', 'crossbows', 'multi-stage', 'bullets', 'witches', 'better', 'high-wire', 'hand', 'hand', 'combat', 'curses', 'love-struct', 'trolls', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'plain', 'bizarre', 'even', 'major', 'scene', 'middle', 'where', 'rape', 'fumbling', 'love', 'encounter', 'are', 'intercut', 'Woah', 'weird.Unlike', 'putrescent', 'progenitor', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'think', 'H', 'G', 'actually', 'sets', 'instead', 'CGI', 'locations', 'filmed', 'Germany', 'leant', 'backgrounds', 'slightly', 'realistic', 'touch', 'bit', 'Grim', 'Brothers', 'Kitsch', 'post-300', 'costumes', 'props', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Also', 'very', 'hit', 'miss', 'flip', 'dialog', 'mostly', 'consisting', 'Gretel', 'one', 'liners', 'ham-handed', 'exposition', 'aimed', 'explaining', 'what', 'plot', 'witchy', 'plan', 'so', 'laughable', 'wonder', 'outline', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'writer', 'eight', 'year-old', 'son', 'Wait', 'Blood', 'Moon', 'grab', 'twelve', 'kids', 'sacrifice', 'dine', 'heart', 'Great', 'White', 'Whale', 'wait', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Witch', '.You', 'might', 'wonder', 'why', 'mentioned', 'Man', 'Iron', 'Fists', 'even', 'entirely', 'different', 'action', 'sub-genre', 'films', 'take', 'similar', 'oddball', 'approach', 'amping', 'aping', 'conventions', 'betters', 'place', 'wire-flying', 'blood-spurting', 'quip-shouting', 'action', 'forefront', 'forgetting', 'meaningless', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'have', 'characters', 'care', 'world', 'sense', 'films', 'have', 'Tarantino', 'inspired', 'tone', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'failing', 'understand', 'stylistic', 'talents', 'master.Oh', 'yes', 'shall', 'mention', 'pretty', 'damn', 'gory', 'Mixed', 'camp', 'are', 'horrific', 'deaths', 'here', 'further', 'incredibly', 'odd', 'stylistic', 'tone', 'Toss', 'haphazard', 'attempt', 'give', 'leads', 'romantic', 'interests', 'Wow', 'skin', 'crawling', 'awfulness', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'be', 'more', 'uncomfortable', 'writers', 'producers', 'actors', 'characters', 'just', 'intercut', 'rape', 'scene', 'Shiver', 'Not', 'ear', 'scene', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'anything', 'clash', 'elements', 'so', 'startlingly', 'inappropriate', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'say.If', 'new', 'normal', 'shoot', 'gatling', 'crossbow', 'now', 'Andy', 'Gavin', 'author', 'Darkening', 'Dream', 'Untimed']",N/A

Luster ""The Rook""","[0, 0]","Based loosely on the Grimm Brothers fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel it follows a similar vain to previous movies in the fantasy genre.  Special clothing and weapons uncommon to that time period make them more dashing, but they aren't so different from what we have seen in other movies.  We first see Hansel and Gretel kill an evil witch after their parents sent them into the woods.  Then a collage of posters and news sheets show us what happened as they grow up.  As adults they save a white magic witch from the Sheriff.  Next they prepare to go after a meeting of the witches for the orange moon.  Meanwhile when they both get separated in the woods, the Sheriff and his men make the mistake of hurting Gretel while a troll is watching.  We learn Gretel's secret as to why the troll goes after the Sheriff and his men.  The sets and costumes are well done and the acting isn't bad, nor even the music although a bit grating at the end.  Somehow it doesn't quite have the pinnache of the Grimm Brothers or Van Helsing.  Nothing seemed new or different about it so I felt I was just along for the ride.  Certainly worth a rental, but I can't recommend a purchase unless you are a huge fan of one of the actors and fantasy.  I purchased the Blu-ray and the video and sound quality are excellent.  It includes extras along with a digital copy.

I thought this movie would take itself a little more seriously...even Jack the Giant Slayer is more watchable than this - ditto any of the recent Snow White movies, or the Red Riding Hood movie.  But this?  It's nothing more than a violent video game with cheesy action hero one-liners tossed in!Okay, calm down. First of all, the plot:  Hansel and Gretel have a bad ""witch experience"" as children (as we all know, it's how the story goes...)so during their adult lives, they decide to embark on revenge on all witches.  Basically, that's it.  There's a tiny bit more, but I won't be a spoiler - not that it matters anyway, since you should not go anywhere near this movie to begin with!There is basically ZERO character development in this version of the story - there is no interesting back story involving any of the witches - just 2 leather clad cool hip vigilante witch hunters who swear an awful lot for mideival times, along with toting huge assault rifles - not very interesting weaponry for a supposedly magical era, right?This movie is such a bad clich&eacute;!  The funny thing is, I don't believe it was supposed to actually be a spoof!  There is even the sexy ""good witch"" thrown in for the guys to drool over, along with the requisite view of her naked (oh please!

Lots of innocent women were burned at the stake during the infamous witch hunts....oh forget it. I guess nobody cares about that.  How uncool of me to bring it up!This movie is mostly blood and violence for the sake of showing blood and violence (think ""D'Jango, with witches"").  Some people say the visuals are great.  Well, I guess they are...unfortunately, good visuals don't make up for weak uninspired writing.No matter what you do, Do NOT let your children see this movie!!!  It just may scar them for life.

1466888,A2G51QSW9WB8I7,B005LAIH2C,Chip,"[0, 0]","First thing to note is this: I am not rating the movie based on its overall quality as a movie. I am rating this movie based on how much I enjoyed it, especially considering how hammy and ridiculous it was. Most movies like this I don't enjoy at all, but I loved and had fun with this one.SPOILERS FOLLOWFirst of all, the story hooked me from the beginning. Maybe I'm on a weird &#34;Hit Girl&#34; fixation from the Kick Ass movies, but when young Gretel stabbed that witch repeatedly, that's when I knew this movie would be a blast. The story kept me entertained and interested throughout the entire film. Then, we have the adult Hansel and Gretel, played by Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton. You can easily see how ridiculous Renner finds the whole thing, but his performance is still fun and enjoyable to watch. In my opinion, it's Arterton (both her character and performance) that steals the show. My favorite scene with her is when she bites the evil town sheriff's nose (after breaking it by headbutting him earlier in the film), and then she spits a chunk of it out, her face covered in blood. Let's not mention all the random F-bombs that Hansel and Gretel (mainly Gretel) throw around. I'm not a fan of much profanity in films usually, but I have to admit that the F-bombs are part of the treat here (since I don't really consider this a &#34;film&#34; but a &#34;movie&#34;).As for the witches, they had to be some of the silliest, least scary, most over-the-top witches in cinematic history...and I loved them for it. There were many moments where I was outright guffawing at the goofiness. On a quick note, I applaud the use of actual prosthetics instead of CGI for the witches; they actually all looked pretty awesome. As far as the silliness, we have these witches, all with superhuman strength in addition to their magic, running around jumping over things, punching, kicking, riding brooms backwards, using magic to make humans kill people, etc. All the while, they look and act like the Orcs from Lord of the Rings; in other words, there's lot of screaming, growling, and head wagging.My favorite performance of all is from the beautiful Famke Janssen as the grand witch Muriel. While I love her for her role as Jean in X-Men, it was seeing her as Xenia Onatopp, the sexually-crazed villain from Goldeneye, that made me love her as an actress. I think she excels at playing villains, and here is no exception. In a way, this role is quite similar to her Goldeneye role. It's extremely over-the-top, she kills a lot of people brutally, and she just completely embraces the ridiculousness of it all and makes it great and memorable. Plus, I admire someone as beautiful as her being willing to appear under ugly witch makeup for most of the movie, although part of me found the witch rather sexy knowing it was Famke.NOTES ABOUT EXTENDED CUTI haven't watched it in full, but I've seen different scenes, and from what I can tell, the extended version is the way to go if you want more over-the-topness. One of the standout new moments is when Muriel (as a watch), bashes a guys skull and pulls out his brain, then throwing it on the ground with an Orc-like head wag.

Last year we had competing Snow White movies and the first movie to follow suit this year is ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"", an R-rated take on the classic fairy tale. As a reminder, Hansel and Gretel are the two twins who stumble across a house made of candy in the forest and commence to eating before they realize that they are enjoying the spells of an evil witch. That is pretty much how this movie starts out as well, but after that, the fairytale is elaborated upon to say the least.Hansel and Gretel are legendary witch hunters when the movie picks up in the middle of a small town about to burn a supposed-witch at the stake. The town has had a rash of child abductions and in classic witch movie fashion, they are out for blind justice on whatever witch they can get their hands on. Jeremy Renner (Hansel) and Gemma Arterton (Gretel) play the title roles and they bring a strong level of coolness to a movie that is already loaded with coolness.The movie starts off fast and never slows down. The action is fast and furious and the 3D is exceptional. The action scenes are quick and entertaining, although much of the moments are lost with edits that are too quick. Things come hurtling toward your face and to say the least, the 3D works well. Just because a movie is loaded with non-stop coolness and special effects doesn't mean that it is without flaw though.""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is 95 minutes of entertainment and excitement. The villain, Muriel, played by Famke Janssen, is exciting and dangerous. You fear her after the first time she single-handedly annihilates a group of witch hunters. Unfortunately though, that is the only real emotion I ever felt in the movie. The movie never slowed down to establish a connection with its title characters and the audience. When their lives are in jeopardy or their friend's lives are in jeopardy, it never once pulled my emotional string. They justify that emotion as well, by not caring either.""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is a fun trip to the movies, but when it's over, it's over. You won't care about it anymore. It won't live on in conversation with any of your friends. It garners only a shrug of the shoulders and a quick, ""Ehh."" It's too bad too because it is also one of those movies that had the potential to be great. The director obviously knew what he was doing visually, but was too wrapped up in looking cool that he forgot to make people care.",3,SUPER COOL but achieves zero EMOTION,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,2573,"['Hollywood', 'be', 'fairy', 'tale', 'kick', 'days', 'when', 'one', 'studio', 'kick', 'others', 'have', 'follow', 'suit', 'compete', 'Last', 'year', 'had', 'competing', 'Snow', 'White', 'movies', 'first', 'movie', 'follow', 'suit', 'year', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'Witch', 'Hunters', 'R-rated', 'take', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'reminder', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'are', 'two', 'twins', 'who', 'stumble', 'house', 'made', 'candy', 'forest', 'commence', 'eating', 'realize', 'are', 'enjoying', 'spells', 'evil', 'witch', 'pretty', 'much', 'how', 'movie', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'fairytale', 'elaborated', 'say', 'least.Hansel', 'Gretel', 'are', 'legendary', 'witch', 'hunters', 'when', 'movie', 'up', 'middle', 'small', 'town', 'burn', 'supposed-witch', 'stake', 'town', 'had', 'rash', 'child', 'abductions', 'classic', 'witch', 'movie', 'fashion', 'are', 'out', 'blind', 'justice', 'witch', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Hansel', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'Gretel', 'play', 'title', 'roles', 'bring', 'strong', 'level', 'coolness', 'movie', 'already', 'loaded', 'coolness.The', 'movie', 'fast', 'never', 'down', 'action', 'fast', 'furious', '3D', 'exceptional', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'quick', 'entertaining', 'much', 'moments', 'are', 'lost', 'edits', 'are', 'too', 'quick', 'Things', 'come', 'hurtling', 'face', 'say', 'least', '3D', 'works', 'well', 'Just', 'movie', 'loaded', 'non-stop', 'coolness', 'special', 'effects', ""n't"", 'mean', 'flaw', 'though', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'Witch', 'Hunters', '95', 'minutes', 'entertainment', 'excitement', 'villain', 'Muriel', 'played', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'exciting', 'dangerous', 'fear', 'first', 'time', 'single-handedly', 'group', 'witch', 'hunters', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'real', 'emotion', 'ever', 'felt', 'movie', 'movie', 'never', 'slowed', 'down', 'establish', 'connection', 'title', 'characters', 'audience', 'When', 'lives', 'are', 'jeopardy', 'friend', 'lives', 'are', 'jeopardy', 'never', 'once', 'pulled', 'emotional', 'string', 'justify', 'emotion', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'caring', 'either', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'Witch', 'Hunters', 'fun', 'trip', 'movies', 'when', 'over', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'anymore', 'wo', ""n't"", 'live', 'conversation', 'friends', 'only', 'shrug', 'shoulders', 'quick', 'Ehh', 'too', 'bad', 'too', 'also', 'one', 'movies', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'director', 'obviously', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'visually', 'was', 'too', 'wrapped', 'up', 'looking', 'cool', 'forgot', 'make', 'people', 'care']",N/A

It's pure schlock entertainment with a strong sense of humor, a high (and gory) body count, and great actors hamming it up and having an utter ball.The story follows that brother/sister duo from Brothers Grimm fame.  They've grown up to become witch hunters, due to a mysterious past they're still figuring out.  They stumble into a ramshackle village plagued by a rash of child disappearances.  Turns out, everything's being orchestrated by a master witch with a devious agenda, and Hansel & Gretel may fit perfectly into her plan...Okay, so it's ludicrous.  But that's part of the fun.  No one's taking anything seriously here, except maybe Jeremy Renner (it's almost as though he can't quite sink down to the appropriate level).  Gemma Arterton is delightfully deadpan; she knows exactly the kind of film she's making and loves it.  Same with Famke Janssen, who brings an appropriate amount of campy menace to her villainous role.  The effects are actually quite good; there's a lot of gore, which usually I'm against, but here it provides the perfect amount of B-grade aura.

It shouldn't be surprising that two of the film's producers are Will Ferrell and his longtime collaborator Adam McKay.  This film is an uneasy marriage of tongue-in-cheek humor and gory violent action.  That said the humor does make some of the more stomach churning effects palatable.

The initial purpose in purchasing it was that it appeared silly, there are times when well done foolishness is just what you want.The spin on witches was excellently conceived, there was an great detail given to provide something creepy and new. They succeeded impressively.Where it falls is in the atavism. Certain amounts are fine, as in the beginning when they were putting pictures of missing children tied to milk bottles. It is when they break out of their own rules that it becomes a problem.Hansel and Gretel are equipped with not only automatic weapons but a taser. Everyone else in this environment is reduced to the standard medieval peasant weaponry of pitchforks and torches along with basic ball and powder guns (with the exception of the ""Sheriff"" who carries a six shooter).Some of the plot points are cliche and painfully obvious but thankfully they do not factor largely into the overall development. Along these lines, though, are the reasons why I was pleasantly surprised by ""Hansel and Gretel"".While trying to avoid spoilers I will say that as you're sitting there thinking, ""Okay, this is going to happen"", the opposite develops.At points I was reminded slightly of Terry Gilliam; the dark use of strange subject matter.

First and foremost this film is fun to watch, but for me it seemed really unbalanced and never really got into a good rhythm because it jumped back and forth from irreverent horror comedy to action adventure to action horror with no rhyme or reason. This led to the fact that this film has a lot of scenes I liked, but the overall story to me seemed slow in developing because I just wasn't that involved in the characters lives. The film however does have a truly beautiful production design and from the make up effects of the witches to the strange almost steampunk inspired fire arms you can really see the money that was sunk into the film.

I expected Hansel & Gretel to be an actioner comparable to Van Helsing or Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter, but those look like masterpieces (they aren't) next to this stinker. This really isn't the showcase for Jeremy Renner which I'm sure he'd hoped it would be. The story starts like the classic fairy tale, but after they escape, Hansel and Gretel begin a career stalking and killing witches. There's a central story thread about trying to learn the true fate of their parents, who dissappeared the night they where rushed from their home by their father and ended up wandering into the witch's candy house. The whole thing is rather convoluted and not very memorable. Much of the time in the action scenes, it's much too dark to see what is going on. They didn't even try to establish accents for these supposedly European characters or make any effort to forgo modern attitudes for the leads. There's a character who is not what she appears to be, but I guessed her secret very quickly.  And somebody must have thought they were being terribly clever by casting Famke Janson, who is a very beautiful woman, as the lead witch.

Only the ""R"" version was released in theaters (and it was a soft R IMO), so there were much more exploding bodies (and parts) to go around the table.  Also, this version was much ""darker"" than the R-rated one.Based very loosely on the fairy tale, H & G starts off with the two innocents being left in a forest whereupon they think they'll find solace--not to mention food--when they come upon the infamous ""house of candy.""  Once they bite the forbidden cookie, they're whisked inside to face the first of many witches.  They dispose of her, flash forward a few years, and H & G's legend precedes them wherever they go.  They are now bounty hunters of a sort, and any town that has a problem with a witch can obtain their services for the right price.  One town in particular is losing its children by droves, and H & G discover the witches' plan (which includes the blood of innocents AND Gretel's heart) which will render the witches able to withstand fire--one of the primary ways they are offed.  Along the way, they also discover the truth about their mother and father and exactly what is at stake should the witches succeed in their plan.Hansel is played by Jeremy Renner, and I liked his character much better than his sister, who was played by Gemma Arterton.  She just lacked the ""oomph"" for me.  Famke Janssen plays the big bad witch, and she is almost perfect.  I would have loved to have seen her taken her character a little over the top (think Charleze Theron in ""Snow White"").  She played the evil well, but at times, seemed disinterested.  She has the size and personality to have really chewed on her scenes; I just wished she'd taken the opportunity.  I thought the makeup and special effects were very good, and Tommy Wirkola did a very good job at directing, playing the entire movie tongue-in-cheek and going over the top whenever possible!

Let me just say that I was intrigued by the premise that Hansel and Gretel might have grown up to become professional witch hunters, so much so that I almost purchased this movie on blu-ray. Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton seemed like they could have had some chemistry, oh wait, they are brother and sister. I guess that is why they threw in a &#8220;good&#8221; witch for old Hansel to have a quick dalliance with.  Poor Gretel only gets knocked about and admired by a troll. In general the action is hyper frenetic, the witches almost as ugly as the villagers and the story, no doubt intended to serve up a surprising twist at the end, was totally predictable. And what is with the rapid fire crossbow? This piece of Hollywood misimagination has shown up in a number of quasi Medieval movies and is always a sure way to shatter one's suspension of disbelief. Why the witch hunters needed strange firearms in the first place is a mystery, but if they had to, for peat&#8217;s sake come up with something more believable and original!

Famke Janssen was terrific as the witch, a part that required tons of energy.  I'm not sure who the movie was aimed at; it was too scary and violent for kids plus there is a brief nude scene; but at the same time it was probably too illogical to appeal to most adults (modern machine guns in medieval times?).

""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' is an interesting genre bender, part horror, humor and fantasy.The prologue retells the fairy tale.  As the story gets underway, Hansel and Gretel are in the City Augsberg, which is under siege by witches who are kidnapping children.  Brother and sister (Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton) are hired to hunt down the witches.  What they find is a bit more complicated, a large coven led by a grand witch (Framke Janssen) who are preparing for a special ceremony, for which Gretel is the missing ingredient.  She will need rescuing by Hansel, assisted by a local fanboy and a plucky white witch, in a dramatic finale that brings the siblings face to face with their own origins.The movie gets off to a bit of a slow start; its mixed elements make for a choppy delivery.  Renner and Arterton take a while to work up some chemistry as siblings.

And a pair of classic fairy-tale characters who have become witch-hunting bounty hunters.If that doesn't tip you off that this isn't a very serious movie, then maybe the title will: ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters."" Tommy Wirkola's first big Hollywood movie is strictly the kind of action-packed popcorn-for-the-brain that is fun to watch, as long as you don't take it too seriously. The biggest problem is that the movie never quite figures out if it's a tongue-in-cheek action movie or a dark comedy.Once upon a time, Hansel and Gretel were abandoned in the woods by their parents, and ended up wandering over to a house made of candy. You know how the story goes -- there's a witch inside, she wants to eat Hansel, Gretel saves the day, and the witch is burned alive.Happily ever after? Well, not exactly. Fifteen years later, Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) are leather-clad weapon-toting bounty hunters who specialize in witches, especially since spells don't affect them. The mayor of a small town hires them when children go missing, despite the meddling of the psychotic local sheriff and his band of goons.After catching and offing a local witch, Hansel and Gretel discover that the witches are planning a massive sacrifice during a forthcoming Blood Moon. Even worse, the witches are led by a Grand Witch named Muriel (Famke Jansson) who knows the secrets of the siblings' past, and the true reason their parents abandoned them. Defeating her and her followers might be more than even Hansel and Gretel can handle.My biggest problem with ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is that it never quite makes up its mind what it wants to be -- it's too serious to be a dark comedy, but still too tongue-in-cheek to be a straight action movie. It vacillates between the two extremes constantly. But either way, it's a fun brainless movie, with buckets of gore and anachronistic weapons (Hansel's love-interest Mina blasts witches with a FRICKING GATLING GUN!).So if you expect a mindless, tongue-in-cheek gorefest, this movie will probably fit the bill. Is it a great movie? Not really. Is it fun? Yeah!  It's not even trying to be ""authentic,"" so it succeeds wildly.Wirkola is pretty obviously reveling in the ability to create a ""dark fairy tale"" with a firm R-rating. It could have used some subplot-pruning (Thomas Mann's ""fanboy"" character is just distracting), but the central tale is a pretty straightforward one. The fun comes from the one-liners (""I hate to break this to you, but this isn't gonna be an open casket""), the B-movie stunts and sets, and the gore. Did I mention the gore? Because there's a lot of it, and it's fun.Wirkola also seems to enjoy showing Renner and Arterton getting beaten up, because nearly every scene with ANY action involves them getting slammed into rocks, knocked senseless, and occasionally stabbed. The Grimm siblings certainly earn their money.Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton honestly couldn't look any LESS like siblings, but both look like they're having a blast as leather-clad, cussing bounty hunters who constantly wave around absurd weapons (Hansel's hilariously phallic gun). They are perfectly suited to the dry, tongue-in-cheek approach of the script, and they even get some interesting character twists, such as Hansel suffering from diabetes because of his all-candy diet as a child.""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is by no means a great film, but it is a resolutely fun one -- lots of splattered body parts, screeching witches and gleeful anachronisms.

(I was also happy to learn that they are working on a sequel to Hansel & Gretel.  I look forward to that with great anticipation.)I bought this version of the film because I'm a sucker for a label that dares to suggest `intense new footage NOT seen in theaters.'  I'm not a timid soul, if you've got an uncensored version of anything I want to see it.Love steampunk, loved the fanciful weaponry used throughout.  Loved that a lot of the action takes place in the wilderness (their interior fight sequences were less successful due to poor lighting).  Loved that the movie was both grim and humorous (it needed to work a lot harder to be dead on funny though).  As for the acting, of the lot Famke Janssen served the movie best as Muriel a witch with a diabolical plan.  Gemma Arterton was also fantastic as Gretel.  Less successful was Jeremy Renner as Hansel, he seemed terribly uncomfortable trying to exist in this wacky world of witches.  Concerning the claim of inconsistent action, yes, a lot of the fighting sequences were straight out of the Looney Tunes handbook of silly, but so what.  Realism was not their aim!  And yes, the story is a bit simplistic; but this is not the type of movie that requires complications to hold our interest.  There is no earth shattering reveal, no twist, nothing surprising or unexpected, it's pretty straight forward.  The plot concerns the siblings Hansel & Gretel who have issues that will never be resolved as long as there are witches to hunt down and exterminate.  They are bounty hunters.  They get paid to do one thing.  That's what this movie is all about.  I don't know how that confused some critics, but it obviously did.For me, the only questionable scene (that was added afterwards) involves an attempted gang rape.  How that got tossed into the mix is anyone's guess, especially as it serves no purpose other than to confuse the intent of the the filmmakers.  It literally came out of left field.Other than that, I have no additional complaints.

1467070,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B005LAIH2C,Graves,"[2, 2]","Let me say I did enjoy this as a mindless fantasy romp, but it is not an unreserved enjoyment. The story is that after defeating the wicked witch in the gingerbread house, little Hansel and Gretel spend the next few years helping other such children as themselves by slaughtering as many witches as they can find, for a price.This follows their latest story where the mayor has called them in to deal with a local witch problem-children are disappearing sure sign of evil witches- but the local constable doesn't like the idea of these bounty hunters telling him how to do his job, so there is set up a secondary plot of the local authorities getting in their way while they're trying to defeat what turns out to be several witches all closing in on the town.There is no epic story telling here. Despite the heroes using crossbows and blades this is a good ol' fashion popcorn shoot `em up. Find the bad guys, deal with them, make a wise guy remark. The eye candy factor, male and female, mostly in tight leather is considerable and adds to the overall charm of the film.So why did I give it only 4 stars? Because there are issues with the time in which it is set. No I'm not being all anal about the weave of threads in stockings worn by peasants. but rather it's not clear when they are. Set in a semi medieval semi age of reason the weapons include fire arms. Likewise accents are all over the place. Mostly Anglo-American with a few German and one Scottish you wonder `why are these people together?' The dropping of f-bombs marks it as not good for children and adds to the anachronism soup. The language is very modern. ""You have got to be __ing me."" Is certainly what you or I might say but it is too modern for the setting.In a fight between Gretel and some of the constable's men you realize they are all wearing leather of the same blue grey shade. This is not some sort of spoiler showing al inked fate-it's sloppy costuming getting all the leather from the same source for the principals and minors actors resulting in another glitch.This isn't a film to look for such minor details, it is a film to cheer as the baddies get blasted and if you like this sort, you will.

Because of that show every supernatural beastie now seems to throw down with the kung fu. HANSEL AND GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS gleefully subscribes to this trend. But at least it's a movie that's very much self-aware and tongue-in-cheek. It's the best thing about it, its irreverent approach.""We learned a couple of things while trapped in that house,"" remarks Hansel's voiceover narration. There's an early scene that details young Hansel and Gretel's terrifying sojourn at the witch's candy house and how they survived that. 15 years later and a years-spanning montage later, we reconnect with the now adult siblings. In this reimagined medieval Germanic setting, Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) are become this infamous pair of wisecracking, f-bomb dropping bounty hunters. They're what passes as the Middle Ages' version of rock stars. Rock stars armed with holy water and heavy artillery.This hamlet's mayor has contracted Hansel and Gretel to track down the local witch what's been abducting children, much to the chagrin of the territorial sheriff (Peter Stormare). Expect this a-h01e peacekeeper to undermine our heroes at every opportunity while leading his own witch hunt.We learn the importance of the impending eclipse of the moon (or ""blood moon"" if you're feeling poetic), of how it ushers in dark possibilities that surface only once in a generation. The nasty witch Muriel (Famke Janssen) means to further the witches' cause. It may require a sacrifice or two at the witch's sabbath, like the life of a good grand witch. And this is probably a SPOILER, but did you know that Gretel's mom is good grand witch? Can you follow the road map?So this movie wanders far away from its fairy tale source material. Doesn't make it bad. HANSEL AND GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS is one of them guilty pleasures that I don't think I should feel guilty about. It's another genre stew that retrofits historical figures or classic fairy tales. Norwegian writer/director Tommy Wirkola messes about with anachronism as if it's the newest coolest thing. Modern-day speak. Gatling guns. Medieval defibrilators. Hansel's having to periodically inject himself because of his diabetes. The banter amused me, such as Gretel about to administer a smackdown on one evil witch but first politely informing her: ""I hate to break it to you, but it's not going to be an open casket."" Heh. So, yeah, unlike VAN HELSING or LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER, this movie owns a wicked sense of humor about itself. It's got more in common with ARMY OF DARKNESS with its tongue-in-cheek sensibilities. The cast is a lot of fun to watch, namely our two leads and also Thomas Mann, who plays an eager lad what's been tracking the careers of and collecting fan boy material on Hansel and Gretel. Famke Janssen has fun being over-the-top. Stormare has fun being petty and despicable. And the whoever is playing Edward, the troll with the emo eyes, is pretty damn boss.So it's loud. It's vulgar. It's violent and super-bloody and awfully gory. It's vaguely steampunk. Our two leads wear their leather pants with pride and with swagger. Yeah, son, it speaks to my inner juvie. The action is wildly outrageous, with an inventive assortment of witches, all of whom come off as formidable and wily and seemingly down with kung-fu. But Hansel and Gretel will match up their kickass arsenal of witch-killing weapons (cough***friggin'gatlinggun***) against them vile crones every time. With a running time of an hour and a half, this sucker doesn't wear out its welcome. And, again, it so unabashedly embraces its attitude and humor and its use of anachronism that it's got a great shot of winning you over.",4,"""Whatever you do, don't eat the fudging candy"" (except he didn't say ""fudging"")",1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,3721,"[""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'Buffy', 'much', 'answer', 'show', 'supernatural', 'beastie', 'now', 'throw', 'down', 'kung', 'fu', 'HANSEL', 'GRETEL', 'WITCH', 'HUNTERS', 'gleefully', 'trend', 'least', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'self-aware', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'best', 'thing', 'irreverent', 'approach', 'learned', 'couple', 'things', 'trapped', 'house', 'remarks', 'Hansel', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'early', 'scene', 'details', 'young', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'terrifying', 'sojourn', 'witch', 'candy', 'house', 'how', 'survived', '15', 'years', 'later', 'years-spanning', 'montage', 'later', 'reconnect', 'now', 'adult', 'siblings', 'reimagined', 'medieval', 'Germanic', 'setting', 'Hansel', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Gretel', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'are', 'become', 'infamous', 'pair', 'wisecracking', 'f-bomb', 'dropping', 'bounty', 'hunters', ""'re"", 'what', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'version', 'rock', 'stars', 'Rock', 'stars', 'armed', 'holy', 'water', 'heavy', 'artillery.This', 'hamlet', 'mayor', 'contracted', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'track', 'down', 'local', 'witch', 'what', 'been', 'abducting', 'children', 'much', 'chagrin', 'territorial', 'sheriff', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'Expect', 'a-h01e', 'peacekeeper', 'undermine', 'heroes', 'opportunity', 'leading', 'own', 'witch', 'hunt.We', 'learn', 'importance', 'impending', 'eclipse', 'moon', 'blood', 'moon', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'poetic', 'how', 'dark', 'possibilities', 'surface', 'only', 'once', 'generation', 'nasty', 'witch', 'Muriel', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'further', 'witches', 'cause', 'may', 'require', 'sacrifice', 'two', 'witch', 'sabbath', 'life', 'good', 'grand', 'witch', 'probably', 'SPOILER', 'did', 'know', 'Gretel', 'mom', 'good', 'grand', 'witch', 'Can', 'follow', 'road', 'map', 'So', 'movie', 'far', 'away', 'fairy', 'tale', 'source', 'material', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'HANSEL', 'GRETEL', 'WITCH', 'HUNTERS', 'one', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'feel', 'guilty', 'genre', 'stew', 'historical', 'figures', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tales', 'Norwegian', 'writer/director', 'Tommy', 'Wirkola', 'anachronism', 'newest', 'coolest', 'thing', 'Modern-day', 'speak', 'Gatling', 'guns', 'Medieval', 'defibrilators', 'Hansel', 'having', 'periodically', 'inject', 'diabetes', 'banter', 'amused', 'such', 'Gretel', 'administer', 'smackdown', 'one', 'evil', 'witch', 'first', 'politely', 'informing', 'hate', 'break', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'open', 'casket', 'Heh', 'So', 'yeah', 'VAN', 'HELSING', 'LINCOLN', 'VAMPIRE', 'HUNTER', 'movie', 'wicked', 'sense', 'humor', 'got', 'more', 'common', 'ARMY', 'OF', 'DARKNESS', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'sensibilities', 'cast', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'namely', 'two', 'leads', 'also', 'Thomas', 'Mann', 'who', 'eager', 'lad', 'what', 'been', 'tracking', 'careers', 'collecting', 'fan', 'boy', 'material', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'fun', 'being', 'over-the-top', 'Stormare', 'fun', 'being', 'petty', 'despicable', 'whoever', 'playing', 'Edward', 'troll', 'emo', 'eyes', 'pretty', 'damn', 'boss.So', 'loud', 'vulgar', 'violent', 'super-bloody', 'awfully', 'gory', 'vaguely', 'steampunk', 'two', 'leads', 'wear', 'leather', 'pants', 'pride', 'swagger', 'Yeah', 'son', 'inner', 'juvie', 'action', 'wildly', 'outrageous', 'inventive', 'assortment', 'witches', 'whom', 'come', 'off', 'formidable', 'wily', 'seemingly', 'down', 'kung-fu', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'will', 'match', 'up', 'kickass', 'arsenal', 'witch-killing', 'weapons', ""cough***friggin'gatlinggun***"", 'vile', 'crones', 'time', 'running', 'time', 'hour', 'half', 'sucker', ""n't"", 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', 'again', 'so', 'unabashedly', 'attitude', 'humor', 'use', 'anachronism', 'got', 'great', 'shot', 'winning']",N/A

It is the pinnacle of bowl-swirling revulsion ... the triumph of the fecal over the feasible. If anyone doubts that our present society of lobotomized, nihilistic sociopaths is on the ascendency, gaze at the positive reviews for this wretched cinematic slap in the face of coherence and doubt no longer.To begin, the idea was actually outstanding: storybook faves Hansel and Gretel survive their gingerbread nightmares to grow-up and become avid witch-destroyers. So many reasonable, exciting, funny, ironic, satirical, scary and even MEDIOCRE things could have been done with that basic plot-line alone, but this Stew of Stool-Samples fails to even hit the level of mediocrity.The dialogue is ludicrously bad: it was clearly written by the kind of 21 year-old college graduates who emerge still utterly illiterate from their &#34;educational&#34; years, probably with degrees in Pole-Dancing or The Sociological Implications of XBox Character Motivation. Indeed, this ghastly piece of brain-sludge plays-out like a cheap video game from the early '90s, designed by bored Japanese gamers trying to approximate an American fairy tale after reading a synopsis translated from English into Sanskrit into Chinese into Japanese and then back into English.The action sequences are juvenile and just plain disconnected from any remotely purposeful trajectory. The entire pacing is arbitrary and dimwitted. The performances are colossally repugnant -- all of them. The CGI is half-baked. The witches look like diseased wax-figures in need of a free clinic. The story is a mangled piece of pork gristle. And Famke Janssen ... Oh, Famke J is looking awfully embarrassed, here, and deservedly so. Someone clearly needed a check and needed it bad. She sleepwalks through this travesty without even the decency to camp it up since it's obvious everyone is going down into the aqueduct that leads directly to Hell's Central Sewage-Treatment Plant, anyhow. But who can blame her? One hopes she was heavily sedated during the &#34;filming&#34; of this barrel of sun-burned fish-guts. I watched her hit her pathetic marks during this &#34;movie&#34; and truly imagined her fighting with the director -- screaming and begging and scratching her own face in anguish after seeing the rushes:&#34;PLEASE, can I do this whole movie in the cheap CVS Drugstore Halloween mask so the crowds of ill-bred millennial spawn drooling into their popcorn will never know it's ME?&#34;Too bad for you, Famke, and too bad for humanity.

1467184,A1VF0102Z9VITO,B005LAIH2C,Joseph M. Reninger,"[1, 3]","Updating fairy tales has been a popular past-time for decades. At first, Disney would give its spin to the classics, mostly by providing happier or more upbeat endings to the tales. Recently, some updates have been more like reversals, making the villains not just sympathetic but even the heroes of the stories. Others have moved the tales to different times and places, often contemporary times and places.Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters start with a faithful if over-the-top retelling of their story of abandoning by their father, discovering the candy house, and killing the witch who was planning to eat them. The feat put them on a career path that takes up most of the movie, killing witches and other nefarious beings professionally. It also sets the tone for the movie. The witch is fairly gruesome and her death in the oven is a bit much. The scene ends with a swear-filled voice-over by Hansel about what they learned from the experience.So there's a lot of swearing and gore and nasty creatures but it's not particularly scary, definitely not a horror film. It doesn't have enough laughs in it to make it a good comedy. Hansel and Gretel are a bit too brutal and a bit too grim to be fun action heroes. The dialogue sounds like contemporary urban characters but the setting is grungy small-town middle ages and the two never quite fit together. The same goes with their high-tech fighting gear and semi-martial arts combat moves--sure they look cool except they don't quite match the other elements. The film makers seem to have had a lot of different ideas of ways to go with the movie and then put them all in without any thought of how to blend them.The movie is very uneven and unsatisfying.",2,Too many ideas not put together well,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,1708,"['Updating', 'fairy', 'tales', 'been', 'popular', 'past-time', 'decades', 'first', 'Disney', 'would', 'give', 'spin', 'classics', 'mostly', 'providing', 'happier', 'more', 'upbeat', 'endings', 'tales', 'Recently', 'updates', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'like', 'reversals', 'making', 'villains', 'not', 'just', 'sympathetic', 'even', 'heroes', 'stories', 'Others', 'have', 'moved', 'tales', 'different', 'times', 'places', 'often', 'contemporary', 'times', 'places.Hansel', 'Gretel', 'Witch', 'Hunters', 'start', 'faithful', 'over-the-top', 'retelling', 'story', 'abandoning', 'father', 'discovering', 'candy', 'house', 'killing', 'witch', 'who', 'was', 'planning', 'eat', 'feat', 'put', 'career', 'path', 'up', 'most', 'movie', 'killing', 'witches', 'other', 'nefarious', 'beings', 'professionally', 'also', 'tone', 'movie', 'witch', 'fairly', 'gruesome', 'death', 'oven', 'bit', 'much', 'scene', 'swear-filled', 'voice-over', 'Hansel', 'what', 'learned', 'experience.So', 'lot', 'swearing', 'gore', 'nasty', 'creatures', 'not', 'particularly', 'scary', 'definitely', 'not', 'horror', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'laughs', 'make', 'good', 'comedy', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'brutal', 'bit', 'too', 'grim', 'be', 'fun', 'action', 'heroes', 'dialogue', 'contemporary', 'urban', 'characters', 'setting', 'grungy', 'small-town', 'middle', 'ages', 'two', 'never', 'quite', 'fit', 'together', 'same', 'high-tech', 'fighting', 'gear', 'semi-martial', 'arts', 'combat', 'moves', 'sure', 'look', 'cool', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'other', 'elements', 'film', 'makers', 'seem', 'have', 'had', 'lot', 'different', 'ideas', 'ways', 'go', 'movie', 'then', 'put', 'thought', 'how', 'blend', 'them.The', 'movie', 'very', 'uneven', 'unsatisfying']",N/A

1467196,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B005LAIH2C,judy,"[15, 24]","Once again critics have just under estimated this film. Yes i know this film is not great but its pretty darn good. I admit walking into the theater i had low expectations about this film i really did sadly. I mean it did not look great from the trailers but i went in and came out happy that i skipped The Last Stand to see this.There were problems with the film i have to say but not many. I don't get how critics came down wand said this film is one star worthy and horrible crap. This film looks like Van Helsing and Abraham Lincoln : Vampire Hunter wait that sounds interesting hum the title is way similar to Hansel and Gretel : Witch Hunters. The problem is i hated Abraham Lincoln so now you see why i came in thinking this film was going to be bad. Yup. This is the first 2013 i have seen this year, and thank god the first film i saw was good. OK now onto the few bad stuff i had with this film. The few things were well the cheap look of the film, language, character development , the open scene, and the length. Ok so this film had a look i didn't like this film just looked cheap like a cheesy B movie which it was not but it just looked like it sadly which kinda took away the class and that with the film. Maybe if they spent more time with detail stuff would look less cheap and better like the candy house and the troll. The language in this film was unnecessary. I mean characters (mostly Hansel) says the F - Word as a joke i mean whats with that how can that be funny. He is all like F this and F that and F F F . It was not needed to make this film good it just was not. It made the film seem stupid like that it was just not needed. This films characters were under developed i mean we needed much more scenes with Edward the troll he was not in enough of the film so we don't learn a lot about him and the same goes for Hansel's love interest Mina plus the teen boy Ben. There was just not a lot of those three and sadly one of them we will never see again in upcoming sequels which i expect will happen due to a decent box office gross. If they don't make sequels we will never know what each of their stories are. But this film was made to set the stage for the oncoming films in the series which it did well enough. The opening scene which had the young Hansel and Gretel coming to the ginger bread house and burning the witch. Well the thing with this was it was just not right. I mean why would the kids just walk on into a strangers house, this part i think should have been at least 7 or 8 minutes longer to better set the stage for the older Hansel and Gretel. The opening was poorly written with little lines spoken and the witch could barely speak English it was just a poor opening. Onto the last thing i did not like which was the length of the film. This film was just too short for this story. this film is an hour and a half which is not enough. Maybe adding an extra half an hour would have been way better so they could extend the opening, add more scenes with Edward the troll, more scenes with Mina and Hansel together, and finally more scenes with Gretel and Ben together (not as a couple but you know what i mean) and well more scenes with Gretel period, sadly she was over shadowed by Hansel due to such a popular actor they had. So naturally she was left out in the rewrites. Ok now on to the good things which include the acting, cast, visuals, action, entertainment, plot, characters, and gore (R- rating) . Ok lets begin with the acting. This film was well acted including new talented actors which are Gemma Arterton , Famke Janssen , and Thomas Mann. Everyone acted excellent in this film you can tell everyone was having a great time doing this film. Which caused the acting to be really good, which surprised me actually. Everyone acted as if it were real and it made me feel like wow is this actually happening. The cast was really good. Everyone looked like their characters mostly the young Hansel and Gretel which really did look like the older versions of the characters. Which really got me thinking wow these people look just like the people in the book. Wow. That was very interesting. The visual effects are not award winning by no means but for only a budget of 50 million i think they did quite well with what they had actually. Which was very good. Like the troll looked cool and that and the flying bullet was cool and well detailed. The action is very good and well paced out we have story then action story then action then more action and story it is just interestingly fun and entering my next subject entertaining. This film is just a dumb fun entertaining film that will keep you at the edge of your seats screaming in excitement as Hansel and Gretel fight witches and that its just so much fun which is rare in a January film actually. The plot i hear has not received good reviews which i don't get whats so wrong with it, yes its simple but its all the same good , am i right even when i took my dad to see this he said the script was weak. Why? Its pretty good to me. The characters are good they are very interesting and they make you want to know more about them. They are characters that if they died you would cry, i am not lying these are good characters. The gore in this film is good, i know i usually go for less gore and a PG- 13 rating but i actually believe that the R Rating for this film made the film better then expected it really did i say so anyway. All an All critics under estimated this films potential. While this film is not a award winner it is still a really really good film. So check ti out in theater if you want to be entertained on a cold January day.

1467248,AFOHUSVNZZ49W,B005LAIH2C,K. Reynolds,"[1, 2]","ARE YOU A good witch or a bad witch? It's easy to tell in writer/director Tommy Wirkola's fantasy horror flick. These child killing, curse-casting evil-doers look as bad as they are and, boy, are they ugly. Beautifully, don't-turn-out-the-lights, Tim Burton-like ugly.Creative make-up and costumes, steam punk weaponry, medieval fantasy sets and high flying wire work give ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" its style. The rest comes from its actors - Jeremy Renner as Hansel, Gemma Arterton as Gretel and Famke Janssen as Grand Bad Witch Muriel - and Norwegian-born Wirkola, also known for ""Dead Snow"" (2009), a nasty little gem about med students on a ski vacation who run into WWII Nazi storm trooper zombies. ""Hansel & Gretel"" is Wirkola's second film.The movie opens with a rehash of the fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm: The children's parents leave them alone in the woods; the starving kids find a house made of candy and are captured by an evil witch who intends to make a meal of them, starting with Hansel. The boy is imprisoned in a cage and forced to eat candy to fatten up, while his sister becomes the witch's slave. But, while preparing the cook fire, Gretel turns the tables on the witch and frees Hansel. Together, the two push her into the oven and save themselves.In three minutes we're watching credits roll, while a series of woodcut illustrations updates the story.In the ""Reinventing Hansel & Gretel"" feature available only on Blu-ray, Wirkola talks about fixating on the story as a boy. He wanted to know what happened next and, in the grand tradition of fanboys everywhere, he figured it out himself: Brother and sister go into extreme witch hunting, saving children and villages, seeking out bad magic-workers and taking care of business. There are other unique twists: Hansel is now a diabetic who must take insulin shots, a result of his first, witchy encounter. Wirkola employs a time-accurate syringe here, big enough to look like a weapon.Sets and costumes may look like fairy tale fantasy, but the weapons and language are anything but. Dialogue is modern and f-bombs explode frequently, especially in the extended edition. The extended film is 10-minutes longer and features more gore, a brutal beating and near rape of Gretel, and a vivid moment of vomiting. Stick with the theater edition, which has plenty of fun without the disrupting excess.As for the weapons ... they would make Rambo proud. There are Gatling cross bows, firing dozens of arrows per minute, automatic weapons, long ribbons of shells, and grenades. A good witch's spell helps make them impervious to bad juju.Additional HD extras are ""The Witching Hours,"" about turning all those extras into individual baddies, and ""Meet Edward the Troll."" Edward is another original to Wirkola's reboot; betcha like him. Note that the extended and extras are only available on 2D Blu-ray; the 3D has the 3D with the theatrical cut, no extras; the theatrical is only available in standard-def, with no extras. Most standard Blu-rays offer both on one disc. What's with that, Paramount?You gotta know this isn't Shakespeare; it's not even J.K. Rowling. ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is good old fashioned, B-grade movie fun. If you've got a taste for the absurd, it is a perfect popcorn movie to watch at home. (But not for young children!) Renner (""Marvel's The Avengers,"" ""The Bourne Legacy"") and Arterton (""Quantum of Solace"") have great brother-sister chemistry, trading quips and rockin' the battles.

I found it to be a fun movie for the most part. It reminded me very much of the '2004' film 'Van Helsing'. If you liked that, you might like this also. They had the same sort of fantastic weapons as Van Helsing did, seemingly impossible for the time periods depicted. There were more witches in this movie than you can shake a broomstick at . Most were appropriately scary or weird looking. The acting was good and there was plenty of action. There was some gore, not too excessive, enough to earn its R-rating I suppose. Occasionally the language seemed a bit out of place, just like the weapons were, for the time. For instance when under-stress our two heroes liked to use the F word. No big deal, just that it somehow seemed out of place, and too contemporary for the surrounding mood. The ending left the door open for a sequel or two if it was a success at the box-office. I did like the friendship that developed between Gretel and an unlikely character in the story. There was also a love story with Hansel. Both side stories added some &#34;charm&#34;. I don't want to say more and reveal too much. I'd give this one a 2 /12 or 3 out of 5 stars.",3,If you liked 'Van Helsing' you will probably enjoy this too.,1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,1281,"['Mini-Review', 'Last', 'night', 'watched', ""'Hansel"", 'Gretel', 'Witch', 'Hunters', 'time', 'available', 'free', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'members', 'found', 'be', 'fun', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'reminded', 'very', 'much', ""'2004"", 'film', ""'Van"", 'Helsing', 'liked', 'might', 'like', 'also', 'had', 'same', 'sort', 'fantastic', 'weapons', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'did', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'time', 'periods', 'depicted', 'were', 'more', 'witches', 'movie', 'can', 'shake', 'broomstick', 'Most', 'were', 'appropriately', 'scary', 'weird', 'looking', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'plenty', 'action', 'was', 'gore', 'not', 'too', 'excessive', 'enough', 'earn', 'R-rating', 'suppose', 'Occasionally', 'language', 'seemed', 'bit', 'place', 'just', 'weapons', 'were', 'time', 'instance', 'when', 'under-stress', 'two', 'heroes', 'liked', 'use', 'F', 'word', 'big', 'deal', 'just', 'somehow', 'seemed', 'place', 'too', 'contemporary', 'surrounding', 'mood', 'ending', 'left', 'door', 'open', 'sequel', 'two', 'was', 'success', 'box-office', 'did', 'friendship', 'developed', 'Gretel', 'unlikely', 'character', 'story', 'was', 'also', 'love', 'story', 'Hansel', 'side', 'added', '34', 'charm', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'more', 'reveal', 'too', 'much', ""'d"", 'give', 'one', '2', '/12', '3', '5', 'stars']",N/A

It is not meant to be anything too deep and thought provoking.  It was simply a shoot em up kind of movie with magic and high tech medieval weapons.  It is, of course, based after the fairy tale.  The premise is, after Hansel and Gretel kill the witch they start hunting witches once they grow up.  The rest of the story is pretty easy to follow.  It does try to throw in a couple twists, but like I said it is not a movie that is all that deep or complicated.This is definitely not a movie that will appeal to everyone.  It has a lot of over the top violence and gore, bad language and sexual innuendo (along with some brief nudity).  If those things turn you off to a movie skip this altogether, because if you dislike that stuff you will hate this.  It is special effects laden, but unlike some movies I do not think that the special effects dominated.  There was enough non green screen scenes to balance it out.  It looks and sounds great on Blu Ray.  I do not have a 3D player/TV so I am not sure how that version of the movie is, but Disc 2 has the unrated version of the film as a non 3D version and the A/V quality of that was great.You will likely already have an idea whether a movie like this appeals to you or not.

Let's do another hard-boiled reboot of a fairy tale because Red Riding Hood was just such an unqualified success.""""Sounds good! How about Hansel and Gretel? That is a story that exists.""""Great, we'll give them guns and make them say a lot of swears. Let's ditch the candy house, that's silly.""""No, keep it! That's what makes it Hansel and Gretel!""""Okay, but it needs to be hard-boiled and also gritty I know EATING THE CANDY GIVES HANSEL DIABETES!""And so begins Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, that sees the eponymous victims of child neglect roast their sorcorous captor and set out on a career of hunting other witches. This naturally entails that they wear lots of black leather and have heaps of guns that didn't exist during the time period in which the movie is set. It also helps that the two are immune to harmful witchcraft, and that evil witches are all ugly. Like, it's mandatory. There are good witches, who are all pretty, of course. Incidentally, PRETENDING to be hot is the MOST ADVANCED skill an evil witch can learn. So there you have it, ugliness literally equates to evil, and all ugly women aspire to be pretty most of all. I think the only thing keeping feminists from picketing this movie is that nobody went anyway, probably including the people who would object to it.Anyhow, Hansel and Gretel arrive in some German town where everyone speaks with English or American accents because who cares, and they promptly interrupt a witch burning because the witch isn't ugly enough. It is revealed that they have been hired to thwart a plague of witches who are abducting the town's children. The pretty-girl-burning sheriff doesn't like this and tries to stop them repeatedly, because the only movies to ever contain good sheriffs were Dead Bang and Walking Tall.Hansel and Gretel head out and mess around in the woods until the movie remembers that it is an American action film. Gretel gets captured because she is a woman, and the evil Grand Witch reveals that Gretel is in fact a white witch, which she inherited from her mother because ""Witch"" is an ethnic group. Hansel and the hot witch he saved earlier set out to rescue her before her heart can be used to make the ugly witches fireproof, which turns out to be easy because they have tons and tons of guns and witches are basically just old women with pointy sticks unless the writers say different.Ignoring the staggering misogyny (and grotesque stereotyping of witches, I guess) on display here, the movie is still pretty terrible. The CG is all awful and plastic-y, the script sounds to be about two pages long (and one page's worth is just the f word and ""witch""), and every ounce of action that might redeem things is ruined by the existence of THREE! DEE! and the resultant need to hurl debris, blood, body parts, whole bodies, bullets, Famke Jamison, and the audience's dignity straight at the viewer. This was irritating when Jaws 3D did it, and if I'm being honest, this movie has even less going for it than that one did.Verdict: If you want to watch a Jeremy Renner movie watch Avengers, and if you want to watch a Gemma Arterton movie, don't.PROS:None. I have nothing nice to say about this movie.CONS:Everything about this movie is offensive to the sensibilities. There is no angle from which to critique this movie from which it will not be found wanting.NOTES:-This is the unrated extended cut, meaning you will see a scene where dudes try to rape Gretel, then a scene where Hansel has some sex.

1467409,A14SRB2VNHKO3J,B005LAIH2C,"Nikki Kasakitis ""Nikki @ Foil the Plot""","[4, 10]","What does the story of Hansel and Gretel teach us? That evil witches who have a taste for children will, one day, get their comeuppance. And don't eat houses made out of candy. That one is pretty important. But have you ever wondered if this is where their story really ends? I have and this is Part 2. Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) are all grown up now but they've never forgotten their harrowing experience as children. After defeating the witch with a hunger for young flesh, they've made it their life's mission to eradicate the world of these vile creatures. Only things aren't quite as simple as they seem. Hansel and Gretel have gone from being the hunters to being the hunted. And now they face a greater evil (Famke Janssen) that will force them to confront their painful past.Retribution is the name of the game in Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters. Ya know, I find it pretty ironic that retribution is one of the many things this movie failed to achieve. Grimm's Hansel and Gretel would be ashamed, because, let's face it--- it was all sorts of bad. I kinda already knew that going in though. The way I saw it, was Hansel & Gretel had all the potential to be one of those &#34;awesomely bad&#34; films I'm constantly raving about. And that, folks, is why I took a chance on it. Unfortunately, such was not the case. My wallet and the hour and half I spent at the theatre are still suffering from severe pangs of regret. I'm sorry, guys. I wish I could blame my justification on illness but any excuse I come up with is flimsy, at best. I just... I don't even know anymore. This movie was far beyond disfunctional and no amount of Jeremy Renner hotness could salvage it from being such a mess.As much as I disliked the movie, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters does have intermittent moments of satisfaction however far and few between they may be. The story has potential. It really does. I like the whole fairy tale/vigilante justice thing. My main problem was that it felt like they weren't even trying when it came to the actual execution. It's like, Hollywood just shoved piles of money at the producers and said, &#34;Here you go, give me bucket loads of CGI. Nothing more, nothing less. Story? The public doesn't give a damn about story. They want blood! And guts! And lots of it!&#34; Hansel & Gretel settles for being over-the-top with the amount violence and gore it presents. And don't get me wrong, the violence and gore is what kept it interesting for me. You will never see a better decapitation scene in a movie, I guarantee it. It's just unfortunate because SFX isn't enough to solely keep this movie-goer wholly entertained.Hansel & Gretel lacks decent dialogue, coherency and likeable characters which is surprising considering the talents they cast in the film. Renner and Arterton are both wooden in their delivery and just look uncomfortable, in general. The movie was relentless and unforgiving, killing off just about everyone, including the only likeable character. If Wirkola was smart, he could've made the film into a clever trope but instead it goes beyond spoofy and lands somewhere in the realm of cartoonish which is, quite possibly, the worst fate to befall an action film.Food for Thought: Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is another film full of potential that was flushed down the toilet. It lacks both the oomph and fun that's assumed by watching the trailer. You go in expecting that it's going to be bad, just not quite that bad. While there were some gratifying death scenes and the all-asstastic Jeremy Renner, neither saves the movie from flopdom. There's none of the magic you'd expect or want in this good fairy tale gone bad.",2,A Good Fairy Tale Gone Bad...,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,3691,"['What', 'story', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'teach', 'evil', 'witches', 'who', 'have', 'taste', 'children', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'do', ""n't"", 'eat', 'houses', 'made', 'candy', 'one', 'pretty', 'important', 'have', 'ever', 'wondered', 'where', 'story', 'really', 'have', 'Part', '2', 'Hansel', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Gretel', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'are', 'grown', 'up', 'now', ""'ve"", 'never', 'forgotten', 'harrowing', 'experience', 'children', 'defeating', 'witch', 'hunger', 'young', 'flesh', ""'ve"", 'made', 'life', 'mission', 'eradicate', 'world', 'vile', 'creatures', 'Only', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'simple', 'seem', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'have', 'gone', 'being', 'hunters', 'being', 'hunted', 'now', 'face', 'greater', 'evil', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'will', 'force', 'confront', 'painful', 'past.Retribution', 'name', 'game', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'Witch', 'Hunters', 'Ya', 'know', 'find', 'pretty', 'retribution', 'one', 'many', 'things', 'movie', 'failed', 'achieve', 'Grimm', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'would', 'be', 'ashamed', 'let', 'face', 'was', 'sorts', 'bad', 'kinda', 'already', 'knew', 'going', 'way', 'saw', 'was', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'one', '34', 'awesomely', 'bad', '34', 'films', ""'m"", 'constantly', 'raving', 'folks', 'why', 'took', 'chance', 'Unfortunately', 'such', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'wallet', 'hour', 'half', 'spent', 'theatre', 'are', 'still', 'suffering', 'severe', 'pangs', 'regret', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'guys', 'wish', 'could', 'blame', 'justification', 'illness', 'excuse', 'come', 'up', 'flimsy', 'best', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'anymore', 'movie', 'was', 'far', 'disfunctional', 'amount', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'hotness', 'could', 'salvage', 'being', 'such', 'mess.As', 'much', 'disliked', 'movie', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'Witch', 'Hunters', 'have', 'intermittent', 'moments', 'satisfaction', 'however', 'far', 'few', 'may', 'be', 'story', 'potential', 'really', 'whole', 'fairy', 'tale/vigilante', 'justice', 'thing', 'main', 'problem', 'was', 'felt', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'trying', 'when', 'came', 'actual', 'execution', 'Hollywood', 'just', 'shoved', 'piles', 'money', 'producers', 'said', '34', 'Here', 'go', 'give', 'bucket', 'loads', 'CGI', 'Nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less', 'Story', 'public', ""n't"", 'give', 'damn', 'story', 'want', 'blood', 'guts', 'lots', '34', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'being', 'over-the-top', 'amount', 'violence', 'gore', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'violence', 'gore', 'what', 'kept', 'interesting', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'better', 'decapitation', 'scene', 'movie', 'guarantee', 'just', 'unfortunate', 'SFX', ""n't"", 'enough', 'solely', 'keep', 'movie-goer', 'wholly', 'entertained.Hansel', 'Gretel', 'decent', 'dialogue', 'coherency', 'likeable', 'characters', 'surprising', 'considering', 'talents', 'cast', 'film', 'Renner', 'Arterton', 'are', 'wooden', 'delivery', 'just', 'look', 'uncomfortable', 'general', 'movie', 'was', 'relentless', 'unforgiving', 'killing', 'off', 'just', 'everyone', 'including', 'only', 'likeable', 'character', 'Wirkola', 'was', 'smart', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'film', 'clever', 'trope', 'instead', 'spoofy', 'somewhere', 'realm', 'cartoonish', 'quite', 'possibly', 'worst', 'fate', 'befall', 'action', 'film.Food', 'Thought', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'Witch', 'Hunters', 'film', 'full', 'potential', 'was', 'flushed', 'down', 'toilet', 'oomph', 'fun', 'assumed', 'watching', 'trailer', 'go', 'expecting', 'going', 'be', 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'quite', 'bad', 'were', 'gratifying', 'death', 'scenes', 'all-asstastic', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'movie', 'flopdom', 'none', 'magic', ""'d"", 'expect', 'want', 'good', 'fairy', 'tale', 'gone', 'bad']",N/A

Who doesn't want hunters for witches that snatch children?  Hansel and Gretel was one of the scarier children's fables I read as a kid.  The execution of the movie, on the other hand, could use some tweaking.It's amazing how subtle things can alter our views so drastically.  ***SPOILER ALERT*** There were a few small occurrences in the movie that made me roll my eyes in disapproval and helped shape my overall view of the movie.The first was the bad a$$ routine by Gretel.  She and her brother waltzed into town and immediately point a gun at the Sheriff to get him to release a wrongly accused witch.  Obviously, when you hunt witches you're so tough that you'll blow anyone away.  It got better as she then head butted him in the face and broke his nose just to show how tough she really is (even though she stood about a foot shorter than him).The second irritating thing was bad a$$ move number two.  When Gretel was captured by the Sheriff and his henchmen she upped the ante and bit a chunk from his nose?!  What?  Who does that?  Was she trained by Mike Tyson?  Of course he proceeded to beat her senseless until she was saved by a troll.The third, and final annoyance was the terrible shooting (when they did get a shot off) and the excruciatingly long fight scenes.

Having killed the witch who tried to eat them as children, the siblings begin making witch-hunting their job traveling from town to town ridding the land of the dark evil with considerable skill and clever gadgets. This steampunk, adult fairy tale is as dark and gruesome as it is smart and funny. Think Van Helsing meets Underworld.While the over-the-top violence was a bit much for my taste, it was rounded out by plenty of humor. And the though a bit predictable, the acting was solid. I especially loved Jeremy Renner's understated performance, as well as Famke Janssen's evil witch persona. This fun, action-packed adventure is packed with suspense, mystery, romance, and excitement.

What also interested me was the human darkness besides the witch threat.  I liked the look of the film and the idea that they avoided a lot of CGI in favor of more traditional effects and animatronics.It is definitely NOT a kids film, though.

1467552,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B005LAIH2C,S. Der,"[3, 7]","This movie was good and has very original story to it. Of course, I'm talking about the after story and not about the whole story that we already know about. I have never heard of the idea of Hansel & Gretel grown up and they are traveling around the world fighting witches. I must say the idea is great start, but is the movie great? I say, NO!The movie had many characters and I believe the casting people did their job right and made a great cast for this movie. I love the casting choice of Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton, and I believe they were Hansel and Gretel. So, I had no problem with the casts in my opinion.I like the costumes and CGI. No problem with that. I didn't watch the movie in 3D, but I did see many scenes that looked to be just made for the 3D effects. All the 2D visual effects I did like and the bloody gore in the movie did look great. It was not over done or underdone in anyway and that's great to see that.As I said for the story line it self was great idea and it works. The movie did its job by showing Hansel & Gretel finding and destroying witches for the whole movie. The movie did its job in telling a main plot for the story. And, the story also tells us a new reason why Hansel & Gretel were abandon in the woods and uses it to fit into the reason why Hansel & Gretel were geared towards being witch hunters.So, what I don't like about this movie. I didn't like a lot of things, but I start off with what I noticed first. I don't like the fight scenes in the movie. The fights are often too fast and not choreography well. What I saw was many scenes throw together and many switching of the camera. The fast camera to camera, back and fore of fighters are way too many times. Throw a punch. Switch! Another person throws a punch. Switch! Another person throws a kick. Switch! Somebody ducks. Switch! And so on. Sometimes, I would see them standing and they would just do a Switch to switch! What??? Why can't they just do more than one thing in a shot? Like punch, kick, jump and throw and now switch or at least two things. Like a simple punch to the guy and other guy punch back? Oh wow. Must be way too hard and complicated! Do they really need to turn many cameras around so that the viewers will get dizzy? Seriously, once you watch that first big fight scene you will see it.I don't like the directing of the movie. Often the movie will feel choppy and a lot of things are just thrown in and it goes to scene to scene, but there are no TRANSITIONS to get to those scenes.  Often, I would be slightly confused and throws me off a bit.The setting for the movie is correct and cool. It looks like early middle ages/dark ages, so characters using crossbows makes sense, but them using guns don't make sense at all. The idea of crossbows and guns just don't mix well. They have guns like old western movies. But, they are dressed up like dark ages look. But some weapons are even more advanced than they should be. I don't believe they should still be riding those horses then. Shouldn't they have vehicles? Why are they living in these cottages? Shouldn't they be living in brick buildings? Why is only their weapons so advanced, but everything else stayed in middle ages/dark ages? That made me wonder and it just doesn't make sense.If they have some high tech gadgets, why not give them some better form of communication too. Really? When Hansel & Gretel got lost from each other, why did they have to yell out to each other? This doesn't make sense? They got all the crazy toys and stuff, but the writers felt they didn't need to give them a good form of communication? Like some signal flares? Actually wait... who needs signal flares? I say just give them walkie-talkies. This movie seemed like they would do whatever it wants at anytime, so give them walkie-talkies. Have them call each other and say, ""yeah, I'm at our old house in the woods."" ""I'll be there in a hour or so."" Now that would had more sense then what we saw in the movie. Gretel is lost. Hansel trying to find her and he is kind lost as well. They both are searching in the woods...but there no real showing of this. That's what I believe they are doing because there not really a TRANSITION to this. Then, bang...we see it and they both are there in the house like they planed to be there at a convenient time. But, guess what? They didn't communicate with each other and so it just happened to be like that. I say NO WAY! Give them walkies!This movie could have been so much better. They would had to just take out certain things that I talked about and do replace with certain things as well. I still recommend this movie because it has an original story and the characters and CGI were great.",3,Good but NOT great!,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,4711,"['movie', 'was', 'good', 'very',

Nope.  I would expect action, CGI (perhaps some cheesy CGI), larger-than-life characters, and a plot that might occasionally make me laugh with what it expects its audience to believe.  When I go to Burger King, I don't expect a steak.And THAT is what I got! Much like 'Van Helsing' (which I also sort of liked, sorry), this film is a lot of craziness, dramatic acting, overblown violence/gore ... and I thoroughly enjoyed the ride. Hansel & Gretel, since successfully burning the witch who was going to eat them as children, have in the years since become professional witch hunters who routinely eradicate villages of their local hags ... for a price. They meet their match, however, when paid to help a village - most of the residents of which hate them for, they feel, drawing witches and death to their village in the first place - and instead come across one powerful grand-witch (Famke Janssen) with plans of her own for the brother/sister pair. Lots of blood, cool weaponry, dismemberment, sarcastic remarks, and both awesome and lame CGI makes for a goulash of insanity that - yeah - I still liked a lot.The film in NO WAY takes itself seriously; do yourself a favor and approach it the same way.

1467599,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B005LAIH2C,Stephen M. Lerch,"[1, 1]","Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is a fun movie, if you approach it as an alternative future for a fairy tale. And you can accept some over the top violence in your fairy tales.In terms of the film itself, I would compare it with the &#34;humor/horror&#34; masterpiece, Army of Darkness. AoD is a better film, in my opinion, but Hansel & Gretel doesn't take itself too seriously, has some crazy/funny horror aspects to it and overall, it works. It's not a masterpiece, but it's worth seeing if you like humor mixed with your horror.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE that the 3D edition is the theatrical edition. It's kind of confusing the way the release is labeled, but make sure you understand that ONLY the theatrical cut is in 3D. The Unrated Cut is 2D Blu Ray only.Video:Discs use the following codecs:1080p/MVC MPEG-4 (3D)1080p/AVC MPEG 4I don't have a 3D capable TV, so I can't comment on that part of the release.In terms of the 2D Unrated Cut, it looks amazing. Blacks are black, colors are subdued in a good way and contrast is good.I'd say this could be a reference video quality release, if there weren't countless other BDs with amazing video with a lot more action to show off what it has to offer.Nothing to complain about in the video arena.Audio:In terms of available audio, you have:English Dolby TrueHD 5.1French Dolby Digital 5.1Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1Portuguese Dolby Digital 5.1I spot checked the non-English audio and it all sounds good. I don't know those languages, so my spot checking can't verify the quality of the translations, etc.The English audio sounds fantastic. It's a very busy soundtrack, with all channels getting a fairly good workout. With how active the sound stage is, you might think there will be listening fatigue, maybe, but honestly the mix is surprisingly well done and works.Extras:The extras aren't anything amazing, and you won't glean any amazing look into the production, though they aren't so bad that if you're interested in extras you would just skip them.You have:Reinventing Hansel & Gretel - Cast and Crew talk about the film and how it came to be.The Witching Hours - Cast and crew talk about the witches themselves, which does include some spoilers, so watch after the film if you want to watch at all.Meet Edward the Troll - Shows you how they created the non-CG portions of the Edward character. Nothing amazing, but OK to watch.Overall:I like the movie. It's fun to watch. It's easy to unplug and just let the action, fun, and bloody violence just happen while you sit, eating popcorn. This movie won't make you stop to think about how it relates to life or swim in it's depth. What you see is what you get.Audio and Video sound and look amazing.Recommended.",4,"Blu Ray looks and sounds great, w/ the movie, YMMV",1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,2713,"['Hansel', 'Gretel', 'Witch', 'Hunters', 'fun', 'movie', 'approach', 'alternative', 'future', 'fairy', 'tale', 'can', 'accept', 'top', 'violence', 'fairy', 'tales.In', 'terms', 'film', 'would', 'compare', '34', 'humor/horror', '34', 'masterpiece', 'Army', 'Darkness', 'AoD', 'better', 'film', 'opinion', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'crazy/funny', 'horror', 'aspects', 'overall', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'worth', 'seeing', 'like', 'humor', 'mixed', 'horror.IT', 'IMPORTANT', 'TO', 'NOTE', '3D', 'edition', 'theatrical', 'edition', 'kind', 'confusing', 'way', 'release', 'labeled', 'make', 'sure', 'understand', 'ONLY', 'theatrical', 'cut', '3D', 'Unrated', 'Cut', '2D', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'only.Video', 'Discs', 'use', 'following', 'codecs:1080p/MVC', 'MPEG-4', '3D', '1080p/AVC', 'MPEG', '4I', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '3D', 'capable', 'TV', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'part', 'release.In', 'terms', '2D', 'Unrated', 'Cut', 'amazing', 'Blacks', 'are', 'black', 'colors', 'are', 'subdued', 'good', 'way', 'contrast', 'good.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'could', 'be', 'reference', 'video', 'quality', 'release', 'were', ""n't"", 'countless', 'other', 'BDs', 'amazing', 'video', 'lot', 'more', 'action', 'show', 'off', 'what', 'offer.Nothing', 'complain', 'video', 'arena.Audio', 'terms', 'available', 'audio', 'have', 'English', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', '5.1French', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1Spanish', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1Portuguese', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1I', 'spot', 'checked', 'non-English', 'audio', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'languages', 'spot', 'checking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'verify', 'quality', 'translations', 'etc.The', 'English', 'audio', 'fantastic', 'very', 'busy', 'soundtrack', 'channels', 'getting', 'fairly', 'good', 'workout', 'how', 'active', 'sound', 'stage', 'might', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'listening', 'fatigue', 'maybe', 'honestly', 'mix', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'done', 'works.Extras', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'anything', 'amazing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'glean', 'amazing', 'look', 'production', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', ""'re"", 'interested', 'extras', 'would', 'just', 'skip', 'them.You', 'have', 'Reinventing', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'Cast', 'Crew', 'talk', 'film', 'how', 'came', 'be.The', 'Witching', 'Hours', 'Cast', 'crew', 'talk', 'witches', 'include', 'spoilers', 'so', 'watch', 'film', 'want', 'watch', 'all.Meet', 'Edward', 'Troll', 'how', 'created', 'non-CG', 'portions', 'Edward', 'character', 'Nothing', 'amazing', 'OK', 'watch.Overall', 'like', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'easy', 'unplug', 'just', 'let', 'action', 'fun', 'bloody', 'violence', 'just', 'happen', 'sit', 'eating', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'stop', 'think', 'how', 'life', 'swim', 'depth', 'What', 'see', 'what', 'get.Audio', 'Video', 'sound', 'look', 'amazing.Recommended']",N/A

1467604,A26MJME9IBNETY,B005LAIH2C,StrangePegs,"[7, 14]","To say that this movie was bad is an understatement. The dialogue was horrible. The story was full of more holes than Swiss cheese. What's really big? Hmm... let's say a planet. But not a small planet like Pluto that gets downgraded from being a planet; let's say something around the size of Uranus, yeah, that one works for this. The plot holes were so big, Uranus could orbit right through them. The movie was absurd. Ludicrous, even. Actually, the movie was at Ludicrous Speed.And I loved it for that. Okay, well, maybe I didn't love it, but I love it in concept. I enjoyed most of the heck out of it despite how bad it was.I can imagine how the concept for this movie came about:#1: Let's make a vampire movie!#2: Vampires are too done, right now. People are over vampires.#1: Well, let's make it vampire hunters, then!#2: No, that's still vampires.#3: What about witches? No one is doing witches.#2: Ooh! We could do Hansel & Gretel! They fight a witch.#1: Witches are lame. They're old hags that can't fight. You'd just have witch hunters walking in and killing all the witches.#3: We can give them powers.#1: Like vampires! They can be super strong and super fast.#2: And know karate!And, so, we get these huge fight scenes of pasty faced witches that look like vampires and act like vampires, except for the biting, where everyone smashes through trees and boulders and flings spells and never get hurt. It was kind of awesome. I mean, it was completely unashamed of itself in how bad it was. It was like watching a four-year-old rolling around in a mud puddle being all self-satisfied. In fact, it was exactly like that.I mean, it was like watching kids play an imagination game where they keep making stuff up as they go.It starts out in a pretty normal Hansel & Gretel setting with some peasant abandoning his children in the woods. The look of the movie is as if it's set in the 1600's. All hovels and burning at the stake and all of that. But, then, as they become witch hunters, there's a scene of newspaper clippings of all the witches they kill as hunters. Newspapers which, of course, didn't exist. All of the ""photos"" are sketches. The movie is full of anachronistic things of that nature. The movie just doesn't care if it fits the time period or not, which is part of what made it fun. It's also part of what makes it ludicrous.Kid #1: We're being attacked by a witch!Kid #2: I pull out my crossbow and shoot at her!Kid #1: She's too fast for your lame crossbow.Kid #2: It's a double-barrel machine crossbow!Kid #1: Fine! I pull out my gun!Kid #2: You can't have a gun! They didn't have guns!Kid #1: They didn't have machine crossbows either.&lt;silence>Kid #2: You can have a gun.Kid #1: It's big shotgun, and I shoot at the witch!The whole movie is like that, and, really, it does just wallow in it, and it made it a lot of fun.Unlike, say, Van Helsing (with Hugh Jackman) which is much  the same but took itself much too seriously to be enjoyable. In fact, Van Helsing is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, which is unfortunate, because I thought Jackman did a more then fine job with what he was given. Hansel & Gretel never takes itself seriously, and, so, I never had a problem with it. Despite all of the horrible inconsistencies. Even as I sit here writing this, I'm thinking about some of the stupid things in the movie, like the witches being, basically, a separate race and the fact that they don't actually look human at all, so why is there ever a witch problem to begin with? But I kind of also don't care even though my brain is yelling at me that I should care.Seriously, it's up there yelling, ""That's so stupid!"" And I'm shrugging and responding, ""But it was fun.""Which is not to say that I'd actually recommend the movie to anyone, because I wouldn't. Unless you like mindless action, because that's what this is. Mindless action with a vague setting. Total cotton candy. If you like that kind of thing, this movie is just for you.As for the rating, it gets 3 stars because it would get a 2 on ""goodness"" but a 4 on ""enjoyableness.""",3,Bad but I liked it anyway,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,4077,"['say', 'movie', 'was', 'bad', 'understatement', 'dialogue', 'was', 'horrible', 'story', 'was', 'full', 'more', 'holes', 'Swiss', 'cheese', 'What', 'really', 'big', 'Hmm', 'let', 'say', 'planet', 'not', 'small', 'planet', 'Pluto', 'downgraded', 'being', 'planet', 'let', 'say', 'something', 'size', 'Uranus', 'yeah', 'one', 'plot', 'holes', 'were', 'so', 'big', 'Uranus', 'could', 'orbit', 'right', 'movie', 'was', 'absurd', 'Ludicrous', 'even', 'Actually', 'movie', 'was', 'Ludicrous', 'Speed.And', 'loved', 'Okay', 'well', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'love', 'concept', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'heck', 'how', 'bad', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'concept', 'movie', 'came', '1', 'Let', 'make', 'vampire', 'movie', '2', 'Vampires', 'are', 'too', 'done', 'right', 'now', 'People', 'are', 'vampires.', '1', 'Well', 'let', 'make', 'vampire', 'hunters', 'then', '2', 'No', 'still', 'vampires.', '3', 'What', 'witches', 'one', 'doing', 'witches.', '2', 'Ooh', 'could', 'do', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'fight', 'witch.', '1', 'Witches', 'are', 'lame', ""'re"", 'old', 'hags', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fight', ""'d"", 'just', 'have', 'witch', 'hunters', 'walking', 'killing', 'witches.', '3', 'can', 'give', 'powers.', '1', 'vampires', 'can', 'be', 'super', 'strong', 'super', 'fast.', '2', 'know', 'karate', 'so', 'get', 'huge', 'fight', 'scenes', 'pasty', 'faced', 'witches', 'look', 'vampires', 'act', 'vampires', 'biting', 'where', 'everyone', 'trees', 'boulders', 'flings', 'spells', 'never', 'get', 'hurt', 'was', 'kind', 'awesome', 'mean', 'was', 'completely', 'unashamed', 'how', 'bad', 'was', 'was', 'watching', 'four-year-old', 'rolling', 'around', 'mud', 'puddle', 'being', 'self-satisfied', 'fact', 'was', 'exactly', 'that.I', 'mean', 'was', 'watching', 'kids', 'play', 'imagination', 'game', 'where', 'keep', 'making', 'stuff', 'up', 'go.It', 'out', 'pretty', 'normal', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'setting', 'peasant', 'abandoning', 'children', 'woods', 'look', 'movie', 'set', '1600', 'hovels', 'burning', 'stake', 'then', 'become', 'witch', 'hunters', 'scene', 'newspaper', 'clippings', 'witches', 'kill', 'hunters', 'Newspapers', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'photos', 'are', 'sketches', 'movie', 'full', 'anachronistic', 'things', 'nature', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'care', 'time', 'period', 'not', 'part', 'what', 'made', 'fun', 'also', 'part', 'what', 'ludicrous.Kid', '1', ""'re"", 'being', 'attacked', 'witch', 'Kid', '2', 'pull', 'out', 'crossbow', 'shoot', 'Kid', '1', 'too', 'fast', 'lame', 'crossbow.Kid', '2', 'double-barrel', 'machine', 'crossbow', 'Kid', '1', 'Fine', 'pull', 'out', 'gun', 'Kid', '2', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'gun', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'guns', 'Kid', '1', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'machine', 'crossbows', 'either.', 'lt', 'silence', '>', 'Kid', '2', 'can', 'have', 'gun.Kid', '1', 'big', 'shotgun', 'shoot', 'witch', 'whole', 'movie', 'really', 'just', 'wallow', 'made', 'lot', 'fun.Unlike', 'say', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'much', 'same', 'took', 'much', 'too', 'seriously', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'fact', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'unfortunate', 'thought', 'Jackman', 'did', 'more', 'then', 'fine', 'job', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'never', 'seriously', 'so', 'never', 'had', 'problem', 'horrible', 'inconsistencies', 'Even', 'sit', 'here', 'writing', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'stupid', 'things', 'movie', 'witches', 'being', 'basically', 'separate', 'race', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'look', 'human', 'so', 'why', 'there', 'ever', 'witch', 'problem', 'begin', 'kind', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'even', 'brain', 'yelling', 'should', 'care.Seriously', 'up', 'there', 'yelling', 'so', 'stupid', ""'m"", 'shrugging', 'responding', 'was', 'fun', 'Which', 'not', 'say', ""'d"", 'actually', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'would', ""n't"", 'Unless', 'mindless', 'action', 'what', 'Mindless', 'action', 'vague', 'setting', 'Total', 'cotton', 'candy', 'like', 'kind', 'thing', 'movie', 'just', 'you.As', 'rating', '3', 'stars', 'would', 'get', '2', 'goodness', '4', 'enjoyableness']",N/A

Peter Stormare, typecast as always, is a corrupt sheriff.With this setting and casting, ""Hansel & Gretel"" is meant to be (campy) fun, which it is not, because of the heavy-handed direction from Tommy Wirkola. Here is a great material for fun movie, but, like in his ""Dead Snow,"" a Norwegian horror comedy about undead German soldiers, the director fails to fully develop the potential of the film.What we get here is so-so action sequences that are enjoyable and forgettable.

It's about Hansel and Gretel, witch hunters. They finally encounter a big bad witch with a bunch of minions that take a little more effort than usual to kill which makes up 75% of the movie.

I only saw the 2-D version and trust me it was well worth the money and experience as I loved it.  It is great fun and what you expect. It starts with the classic Grimms Fairy Tale Story and Oh My God the Wicked Witch in the gingerbread and candy house is one of the most creepy, chilling and scarey witches I have ever seen on film. She will scare the Hell out of you and make you jump with fear! As you know Hansel and Gretel barely escape with their lives after pushing the witch into a firey death. As they grow up they then become witch hunters who go around the country side saving children from other hags intent on killing and eating youngsters. The look and feel of the movie is the same as if you were living back then some 200 years ago when the story takes place like the classic tale. This film has it all, horror, action and comedy and moves fast from beginning to end and never a dull moment! It will make you jump, scream, laugh and have your jaw drop open with disbelief with what you just saw on the screen. The Wicked Witches are Scarey, Chilling and indeed Creepy!!  The cannibal crones attack like the living dead hungry for flesh and blood of the innocent. Some of them even fly on broom stick like tree branches trying to escape the wrath of adult Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters. The witches are the classic fairy tale type and what you hope and expect from a rated R Horror/Action/Comedy Hansel and Gretel movie for adults!! I am going to buy this on DVD as soon as it is released and this is one of those movies that you will enjoy watching over and over again and even sharing with your friends too. Don't listen to any of the negative comments about this movie from others. If you loved the Hansel and Gretel Fairy Tale and think Creepy story book witches are bad ass then your in for a treat and will enjoy and love this fun and scarey feature film too!!
