436323,A2SREHCZ1DAQ8J,6304819293,Allan Broadfield,"[10, 10]","The 'ultimate edition' of this film is just that, the best, as far as I know, available. All other representations I have seen of this film appear to originate from the same tired masters. This particular edition is the 'bees knees'! There have been no 35mm elements available for years, but this edition is probably the closest we will get, it's a 16mm print taken from a 35mm element and is as sharp and clear as 16mm can be under the circumstances. The grey scale retains it's integrity which means you won't miss any details, and it has been slightly framed so that you wont miss anything at the edges. Yes, there are plenty of scratches and blemishes, but I imagine that this would be very costly to remove.Extras include; a copy of the original programme, an interesting and informative commentary, a film of Lon Chaney visiting the set, an extract from another Chaney film, and 3D photographs taken on the set at the time, that you can view through supplied glasses !

436324,A16ZKEWQ6DLO45,6304819293,amerk,"[1, 1]","I'm in my early thirties, so I don't know what impact silent films, and even films in the black and white era (for that matter), had at the time of their release. However, I do recall a time growing up (in the late eighties / early nineties) when going to the theater was still a welcoming experience. I can't really say the same for the past few years, and I don't really remember the last movie I saw at the theaters.When I was growing up, my dad would often have an old movie playing, usually a rerun on TMC late at night. While I was a bit too young to really appreciate the quality of these films (The Phantom of the Opera, Nosferatu, and even The Hunchback of Notre Dame), I was at least intrigued enough to watch the films most of the way through.Now that I'm older, I've had a desire to start watching old horror movies. Most recently, I've went back and watched the old Psycho movie, followed by the Boris Karloff version of The Mummy. And now, just the other day, I decided to pull up this old classic on Youtube through my Blu Ray player.What can I say except this is one masterpiece of a movie. Now, I know it doesn't follow the original novel to a full degree, what movie ever does? However, I was impressed at how much story could be told in a silent film with just a few short instances of written dialogue; especially when newer movies try to dumb down the experience by explaining everything the viewer sees, as if the viewer isn't intelligent enough to figure things out for themselves.Now, the only gripe I had with the movie was that at an hour and forty minutes, it actually comes across as a bit long, especially when similar movies for its time were shorter. And indeed, some parts do drag out a bit. However, this is a very minor gripe for me. There's something to be said about this era of film making when it can still compell its audience to cheer and weep for the hero.",5,When Movies Had Heart,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",2013,1897,"[""'m"", 'early', 'thirties', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'impact', 'silent', 'films', 'even', 'films', 'black', 'white', 'era', 'matter', 'had', 'time', 'release', 'However', 'do', 'recall', 'time', 'growing', 'up', 'late', 'eighties', '/', 'early', 'nineties', 'when', 'going', 'theater', 'was', 'still', 'welcoming', 'experience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'same', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', 'last', 'movie', 'saw', 'theaters.When', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'dad', 'would', 'often', 'have', 'old', 'movie', 'playing', 'usually', 'rerun', 'TMC', 'late', 'night', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'young', 'really', 'appreciate', 'quality', 'films', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Nosferatu', 'even', 'Hunchback', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'was', 'least', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'watch', 'films', 'most', 'way', ""'m"", 'older', ""'ve"", 'had', 'desire', 'start', 'watching', 'old', 'horror', 'movies', 'Most', 'recently', ""'ve"", 'went', 'back', 'watched', 'old', 'Psycho', 'movie', 'followed', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'version', 'Mummy', 'now', 'just', 'other', 'day', 'decided', 'pull', 'up', 'old', 'classic', 'Youtube', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'player.What', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'masterpiece', 'movie', 'Now', 'know', ""n't"", 'follow', 'original', 'novel', 'full', 'degree', 'what', 'movie', 'ever', 'However', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'much', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'told', 'silent', 'film', 'just', 'few', 'short', 'instances', 'written', 'dialogue', 'especially', 'when', 'newer', 'movies', 'try', 'dumb', 'down', 'experience', 'explaining', 'everything', 'viewer', 'sees', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'intelligent', 'enough', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'themselves.Now', 'only', 'gripe', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'hour', 'forty', 'minutes', 'actually', 'bit', 'long', 'especially', 'when', 'similar', 'movies', 'time', 'were', 'shorter', 'indeed', 'parts', 'do', 'drag', 'out', 'bit', 'However', 'very', 'minor', 'gripe', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'era', 'film', 'making', 'when', 'can', 'still', 'compell', 'audience', 'cheer', 'weep', 'hero']",N/A
436325,AH9K6PPVZKVY3,6304819293,Barbara (Burkowsky) Underwood,"[2, 2]","This new Ultimate Edition of the 1923 silent version of ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" is a very nice set with various interesting bonus material such as a reproduction of the original theatre program booklet and other information generally aimed at the serious movie aficionado.  And as every good movie fan would know, ""The Hunchback"" is one of those enduring and immortal classic tales which never loses its appeal through the ages, and like many high quality silent films of the 1920s, this version also has special features of interest to modern-day audiences.  The most striking aspect for most people would surely be the extraordinary character actor, Lon Chaney, whose unique talents make the Hunchback come to life and take over the story, just as his other famous role in ""The Phantom of the Opera"".  An expert in make-up and disguise, Chaney also excelled in body language and could make his characters ooze emotions in silent films merely with gestures, posture and movements.  This expressive acting conveys the feeling of the real human being underneath the obvious heavy make-up of the Hunchback, as this despised monstrosity who finds shelter in the Notre Dame cathedral becomes involved in medieval intrigues between the rich aristocracy and the poor beggars.  A love story and a tragic tale of a mother who lost her small child are also cleverly woven into this classic Victor Hugo novel, which Chaney and Universal Studios strove to reproduce as best as possible.  Much of that effort is visible in the sets which were built at Universal at great cost, making ""Hunchback"" Universal's first big-budget spectacle picture in an attempt to keep up with other studios that were producing grand scale historic costume epics at that time.  Getting background information like this from both the enclosed notes and the audio commentary on the DVD helps the modern viewer to appreciate the importance of this film at the time, its part in the development of the Hollywood studios and grand costume dramas with sets and effects no longer viable today, but nevertheless still impressive today.  Those looking for `horror' by today's standards in this film will be disappointed, but as a classic story with realistic historical sets and characters dealing with issues that never go out-of-date, ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" is an important milestone in cinema's history.  It has a fitting standard classic orchestral score, and the picture quality is very good overall, with only several scenes appearing scratchy or worn, but no doubt this is a  better quality production than many previous public domain issues without the in-depth bonus features.",5,A Classic for all movie-buffs,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,2656,"['new', 'Ultimate', 'Edition', '1923', 'silent', 'version', 'Hunchback', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'very', 'nice', 'set', 'various', 'interesting', 'bonus', 'material', 'such', 'reproduction', 'original', 'theatre', 'program', 'booklet', 'other', 'information', 'generally', 'aimed', 'serious', 'movie', 'aficionado', 'good', 'movie', 'fan', 'would', 'know', 'Hunchback', 'one', 'enduring', 'immortal', 'classic', 'tales', 'never', 'appeal', 'ages', 'many', 'high', 'quality', 'silent', 'films', '1920s', 'version', 'also', 'special', 'features', 'interest', 'modern-day', 'audiences', 'most', 'striking', 'aspect', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'surely', 'be', 'extraordinary', 'character', 'actor', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'unique', 'talents', 'make', 'Hunchback', 'come', 'life', 'take', 'over', 'story', 'just', 'other', 'famous', 'role', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'expert', 'make-up', 'disguise', 'Chaney', 'also', 'excelled', 'body', 'language', 'could', 'make', 'characters', 'ooze', 'emotions', 'silent', 'films', 'merely', 'gestures', 'posture', 'movements', 'expressive', 'acting', 'conveys', 'feeling', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'obvious', 'heavy', 'make-up', 'Hunchback', 'despised', 'monstrosity', 'who', 'shelter', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'cathedral', 'becomes', 'involved', 'medieval', 'intrigues', 'rich', 'aristocracy', 'poor', 'beggars', 'love', 'story', 'tragic', 'tale', 'mother', 'who', 'lost', 'small', 'child', 'are', 'also', 'cleverly', 'woven', 'classic', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'novel', 'Chaney', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'strove', 'reproduce', 'as', 'best', 'possible', 'Much', 'effort', 'visible', 'sets', 'were', 'built', 'Universal', 'great', 'cost', 'making', 'Hunchback', 'Universal', 'first', 'big-budget', 'spectacle', 'picture', 'attempt', 'keep', 'up', 'other', 'studios', 'were', 'producing', 'grand', 'scale', 'historic', 'costume', 'epics', 'time', 'Getting', 'background', 'information', 'enclosed', 'notes', 'audio', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'modern', 'viewer', 'appreciate', 'importance', 'film', 'time', 'part', 'development', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'grand', 'costume', 'dramas', 'sets', 'effects', 'no', 'longer', 'viable', 'today', 'nevertheless', 'still', 'impressive', 'today', 'looking', 'horror', 'today', 'standards', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'classic', 'story', 'realistic', 'historical', 'sets', 'characters', 'dealing', 'issues', 'never', 'go', 'out-of-date', 'Hunchback', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'important', 'milestone', 'cinema', 'history', 'fitting', 'standard', 'classic', 'orchestral', 'score', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'only', 'several', 'scenes', 'appearing', 'scratchy', 'worn', 'doubt', 'better', 'quality', 'production', 'many', 'previous', 'public', 'domain', 'issues', 'in-depth', 'bonus', 'features']",N/A
436326,AIMR915K4YCN,6304819293,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[3, 3]","Quasimodo (Lon Chaney) lives within the towering walls of the Notre Dame cathedral. He is considered a freak by everyone, especially his ""master"" Jehan, who treats him as if he were a pet. During the ""Festival of Fools"", the beautiful gypsy girl, Esmeralda (Patsy Ruth Miller) dances for the crowd. Jehan is filled with lust and sets out to have her at all cost. He uses Quasimodo to attempt a kidnapping, letting him take the fall when the soldiers come to Esmeralda's rescue. Phoebus, the captain of the guard, falls madly in love with Esmeralda, setting out to win her hand in marriage. Meanwhile, poor Quasimodo is chained and whipped before a jeering throng of onlookers. Esmeralda happens by and gives him water after hearing his pitiful cries of thirst. She also covers his wounds. This gives Quasimodo his first real taste of unconditional compassion from a fellow human being (other than the priest brother of Jehan). Alas, there seems to be far more evil than good! Quasimodo must ultimately save Esmeralda from execution when Jehan stabs Phoebus in the back, leaving her to take the rap for his crime (notice any pattern here?). While this is going on, the peasants, under their leader Clopin, have decided to rise up and revolt against the tyranny they've been crushed under for so long. THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME is quite an ambitious movie! There are several villains and heroes, all with different agendas. Quasimodo is the purest character in the story, driven only by his instincts and impulses, he helps those who help him and hurts those who hurt him. This movie also has Esmeralda's mother, a woman who hates gypsies for stealing her baby girl, never realizing until near the end that her daughter is right in front of her. Quasimodo is a tragic character on par with Frankenstein's monster, King Kong, etc. Chaney was a true genius at giving emotional depth to the hapless, ""ugly"" creatures he portrayed. In HUNCHBACK, he breathed life into a role that could have easily been just another two dimensional monster. This classic belongs on your DVD shelf with PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, NOSFERATU, METROPOLIS, and DOCTOR JEKYLL AND MISTER HYDE.

436327,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,6304819293,Chip Kaufmann,"[52, 54]","...although this new Image release which replaces their 1999 edition is likely the best that we'll see until someone can afford to do a full scale restoration. David Shepard and Film Preservation Associates are to be commended for making this look as good as they have considering the limited funds they have to work with (Shepard once said that Kevin Brownlow and Photoplay Productions spend on one reel what he spends on an entire film) and the source material which appears to be 16mm. There is no significant new footage here but the film has been speed corrected which accounts for the longer running time. The print seems to be the same as the 1999 release with lots of scratches throughout but the image is sharper and the toning of certain scenes is better.Aside from the condition of the print what really keeps this from being the ""Ultimate Edition"" is the score by Donald Hunsberger. Hunsberger is a fine conductor (check out his Eastman Wind Ensemble recordings) but the music he compiled is too lighthearted overall and not sombre or medieval enough to enhance what's going on during the movie especially toward the end (the compiled score used for the 1999 version was far more appropriate). A darker score like the one Ennio Morricone did for the 1912 RICHARD III would help to undercut the melodramatic elements of the story and some of the performances. Once again a score can make or break a silent film.Lon Chaney remains a marvel as Quasimodo, fully inhabiting the character beneath the makeup and the natural speed transfer restores his performance to what it should be. The medieval sets and vast army of extras also continue to inspire awe 80+ years later. The disc comes with program reproductions, 3-D glasses for old stills, and commentary from Chaney scholar Michael F. Blake. So fans of HUNCHBACK and Chaney rush out and be sure to get this edition for your DVD collection.

Despite its age the film is beautifully acted and the set decoration is magnificent.  The music for this release is by Robert Israel who scored Harold Lloyd's silent films.  The score is nicely conceived and well performed.  The only reservation I have is that when Lon Chaney rings the large bell the sound is that of a tubular bell: higher pitched and not a deafening as the real bell would be.  I was wondering why a more suitable large bell sound was not substituted in the soundtrack.The print is not bad.  The print is of an uneven quality with some scratching but no serious damage that ruins the image altogether.  Sometimes the print has a gray cast to it.  One hopes that at some point there will be a way to repair these damaged prints so we can enjoy clean images. The night tinting looks a bit light and not the deep blue that I have seen in other prints; but the color is effective in handling the transition to night. Of the extras, the remains of Alas and Alack are interesting as an early performance by Lon Chaney, who we see in the roll of a hunchback and a fisherman.  We do not see Chaney in close-up, unfortunately, before the available film cuts off. There is also a silent short of Chaney on the Hunchback set wearing a suit and paying no attention to the camera that is recording his short climb up the cathedral facade.  There are a large number of stills, many of which can be view with the enclosed 3-D glasses.I enjoyed the reproduction of the souvenir booklet that was enclosed with the many still photographs and sort biographies of the stars.

It has of course been enhanced for this edition that does not guarantee it is what it was. The image is amazingly clear and amazingly well centered and framed. Amazingly for 1923. The story is mythical and has been for nearly two centuries now. This version insists a lot more on the melodramatic than on the tragic. It centers too often on the spectacular and not on the deeply sentimental, sensual and psychological. It turns Quasimodo into a freak and nothing else and we miss the complex network of antagonistic loves running around Esmeralda. What's more it treats the king the way Victor Hugo, a Republican at heart, would never have done because it was perfectly unfair. What's more I would not swear whether the king lived in the Bastille castle or not, but across from the cathedral the famous Chtelet was already built, in sections at least, and it was a royal residence. To present the king Louis XI as a tyrant is totally anti-historical, which Victor Hugo was not. In the fifteen century we could say this king was cruel or violent, but he was also just and fair, hence he was only cruel and brutal with those who were considered as guilty in his days, though at times the crimes of these old centuries were absolutely exaggerated. But what the film is very good at expressing is the positive feelings, like love and attraction, plus fear, but not terror or even menace. This American director was also fascinated by crowd movements. It is surprising how far away from his European counterparts he was. The Germans were producing horror films upon horror films, absolutely bleak science-fiction. The Russians were producing masterpieces with Eisenstein but all concentrating on the Soviet revolution and Russian history. Some scene have become mythical too like the pram and the baby going down the stairs in ""Potemkin"". The French were more in sentimental and sentimentalese productions and some realistic left-minded and even openly communist-minded documentaries. On the other side of the Atlantic the great productions where comic films with Laurel and Hardy, Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin (who was British by the way) and a few others.

The sets used in the film were very good for the time period, as many as 2500 extras were used in the ""crowd"" scenes, some of the cinematography was better than expected, and, of course, the excellent work of Lon Chaney, the ""man of a thousand faces,"" shines throughout the film.  Chaney's make-up for the ""hunchback"" character was remarkable considering this film was made in the early 1920s.However, there were a few areas where the film did not meet expectations.  One centers around the plot itself.  Although the title of the film is ""Hunchback"" etc., Chaney's character actually plays more of a minor role.  The real storylines revolve around Esmerelda the gypsy girl and Captain Pheobus, the scheming Jehan (brother of the bishop), and the gypsy ""king"" Clopin.  This is a serious departure from Victor Hugo's original tale, and I don't know why the filmmakers changed the story in this way.  Think of taking the movie ""Dracula"" and making it more about Jonathan Harker than the count.  That's kind of what they did here.In addition to that, another minor issue is that the film is indeed ""silent.""  I knew that before I watched it, but I was under the impression that there would be some sort of music track to accompany the film, much like what was done in the real silent movie theaters of the time.  The films were not viewed in complete silence. However, this production has no music track.  It really is ""silent.""  So beware - it made for difficult viewing at times, to watch something for over 90 minutes that had no sound effects or music of any kind.Overall I gave this three stars, mostly because of Lon Chaney and the realism of the Paris sets.

The film is about a deaf, half-blind, and deformed man named Quasimodo who is the bell ringer at the church of Notre Dame in Paris. The movie states that it takes place ten years before Columbus discovered America which would place the film at 1482. Now there is also a beautiful gypsy by the name of Esmeralda who has been adopted by Clopin, the king of the beggars. Esmeralda falls in love with the Captain of the Guard, Phoebus de Chateaupers. However, Clopin disagrees with the crossing of the two classes and starts an uprising plus Claude Frollo (the Archdeacon at Notre Dame) attempts to seduce Esmeralda. The story is overall pretty interesting and it follows the novel much closer than the majority of movie adaptations out there although there are still a few key differences.The acting in this picture is a mixed bag with Lon Chaney stealing the show as Quasimodo. He is amazing and truly looks like he could be a deformed person in that position. Chaney especially does a good job at getting his emotions across without the use of spoken dialogue. Patsy Ruth Miller does an above average job as Esmeralda but with the high budget of this film I expected some better acting with her character. Most of the remaining actors do a pretty good job in their roles but nothing spectacular.When it comes down to the technical aspects of the film it is very impressive for 1923. All of the sets are grand in scope and truly set the time period and location perfectly. Lon Chaney's make up is extraordinarily good with him doing his own makeup. Also the music is very good and a lot of it goes along with the film better than most silent film scores. Where sound effects are used they are used excellently as well.So overall there aren't any major problems with this film but there are some flaws. The story is pretty good but not anything amazing. As for the acting you have Lon Chaney who does a spectacular job while the rest of the cast is merely good but nothing great. Special effects and music are really good in this movie though and they all work very well for the time.

The novel is one of the great landmarks of Humanist Litterature, while this is simply an uptight morality-play of the somewhat Victorian orientation. Claude Frollo, one of the great villains of litterature, is in this version meek as a lamb (he's a catholic priest for God's sake), while his villainy is rendered to his secular brother, Jehan, thus creating a dualism (good/evil) that is totally foreign to the humanism of the novel. Jehans villainy is consisting of his base lust after Esmaralda, the sexy gipsy girl (bad people are horny, good people are in love). But alas, her sexuality is hampered too, even her familiar, the goat, is missing! Phoebus, who in the novel seduced Esmaralda simply because he was able to, taking advantage of her girlish admiration for his manners and shiny armour, is turned into a coy and rather laughable vaudeville-jeune premier, his intentions are quite honorable and poor Esmaralda want's to go to a nunnery to save his honour. Even worse, Clopin, the leader of the rebellious crowd fighting the decadent aristocracy, is portraied as a sneering creep, thus forcing us to question his heroic ambitions on a somewhat unjust grounding. And Quasimodo? Well, Lon Chaney does his usual routine, twitching under a mass of make-up. This is really just one of his ""thousand faces"".Nothing works, apart from the spectacular setpieces of medieval Paris. And old age can't be blamed (in the same period the germans were creating expressionist masterpieces still working) but simply bad storytelling.

And Chaney's make-up remains unequaled even today. And of course, his performance was just as unforgetable.But at least one so-called Chaney ""expert"" really needs to know his facts before just blathering innacuracies. There are several good bios out there; he should've read one. To that end, just a few truth-adjustments:First, The Penalty wasn't a horror film; it was a melodrama. Neither, for that matter, was Hunchback. It was also a melodrama. Chaney first got the attention of fans with Miracle Man, not Penalty. Hunchback made him a major star. Chaney only made two real horror films, actually, and one of those is lost.Second: There is no absolute proof that Chaney co-directed Phantom. None. It's just rumored because he and the director didn't get along. He did, however, first make the inquiry about the story.Third: Chaney wasn't considered the greatest character actor; he was considered a major actor, period. He was a true superstar, in fact.Fourth: Chaney was NOT Universal's most bankabale star. Phantom & HUnchback were the only 2 major films he made for Universal. He was, however, one of MGM's biggest box-office draws for years.Fifth: Chaney died in 1930, not 1933. He likely would have played Dracula (which was 1931, not 33) -- Browning wanted him for it.

436347,AGK4BEIQ017HY,6304819293,P. I. Johnson,"[6, 8]","1920 saw the first outing of interest to horror fans of the silent period's most famous character actor, Lon Chaney Sr, when he appeared in director Wallace Worsley's The Penalty. Worsley and Chaney teamed up more famously for this classic 1923 film version of Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Chaney's career-making turns in Hunchback and as Gaston Leroux's Phantom of the Opera (1925) which Chaney himself co-directed, would forever seal his credentials as an actor of considerable skill and of one of the early stars of what after 1930 would become the horror genre. His performance as Quasimodo in the 1923 film remains a spectacular showcase for his athleticism and physicality as an actor, prefiguring the arrival of later actors like Burt Lancaster. For modern audiences, Hunchback is probably one of the most accessible of the early silent movies. The film has aged well and the scale of its sets and set pieces will be a pleasant surprise to many. Both Phantom and Hunchback were products of entrepeneur Carl Laemmle's fledgling Universal Film Manufacturing Company, later to become Universal Studios - the Hollywood home of horror movies - as producers of Dracula, Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. Chaney would equally go on to become Universal's most bankable star in the silent period and be justifiably regarded as the greatest character actor of his time - and he was a bona fide horror star to boot. Chaney would star in other horror movies until his death in 1933 (including the first horror-comedy The Monster in 1925) but Phantom, Hunchback and the Tod Browning movies have come to be regarded by horror critics and collectors as his signature roles in the silent era. His association with Browning would continue until his death (ironically, not long after being cast to star in what would have been his first major sound role, Dracula, which was to be directed by Browning for Universal).",5,Hollywood - and horror's -  first great acting performance,981417600,"02 6, 2001",2001,1925,"['1920', 'saw', 'first', 'outing', 'interest', 'horror', 'fans', 'silent', 'period', 'most', 'famous', 'character', 'actor', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Sr', 'when', 'appeared', 'director', 'Wallace', 'Worsley', 'Penalty', 'Worsley', 'Chaney', 'teamed', 'up', 'more', 'famously', 'classic', '1923', 'film', 'version', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'Hunchback', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'Chaney', 'career-making', 'Hunchback', 'Gaston', 'Leroux', 'Phantom', 'Opera', '1925', 'Chaney', 'co-directed', 'would', 'forever', 'seal', 'credentials', 'actor', 'considerable', 'skill', 'one', 'early', 'stars', 'what', '1930', 'would', 'become', 'horror', 'genre', 'performance', 'Quasimodo', '1923', 'film', 'spectacular', 'showcase', 'athleticism', 'physicality', 'actor', 'prefiguring', 'arrival', 'later', 'actors', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'modern', 'audiences', 'Hunchback', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'accessible', 'early', 'silent', 'movies', 'film', 'aged', 'well', 'scale', 'sets', 'set', 'pieces', 'will', 'be', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'many', 'Phantom', 'Hunchback', 'were', 'products', 'entrepeneur', 'Carl', 'Laemmle', 'fledgling', 'Universal', 'Film', 'Manufacturing', 'Company', 'later', 'become', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'Hollywood', 'home', 'horror', 'movies', 'producers', 'Dracula', 'Frankenstein', 'Bride', 'Frankenstein', 'Chaney', 'would', 'equally', 'go', 'become', 'Universal', 'most', 'bankable', 'star', 'silent', 'period', 'be', 'justifiably', 'regarded', 'greatest', 'character', 'actor', 'time', 'was', 'bona', 'fide', 'horror', 'star', 'boot', 'Chaney', 'would', 'star', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'death', '1933', 'including', 'first', 'horror-comedy', 'Monster', '1925', 'Phantom', 'Hunchback', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'be', 'regarded', 'horror', 'critics', 'collectors', 'signature', 'roles', 'silent', 'era', 'association', 'Browning', 'would', 'continue', 'death', 'ironically', 'not', 'long', 'being', 'cast', 'star', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'major', 'sound', 'role', 'Dracula', 'was', 'be', 'directed', 'Browning', 'Universal']",N/A

Now, to be fair there is some slight improvement in quality. There is much more sharpness and detail than the previous version. It doesnt look as washed out as the other version did. It has also been speed corrected  to have a more natural and smoother flow to it. Also a new stereo surround music accompaniment has been added. It is a much more enjoyable experience to view than before. Lon Chaney gives a superb performance as the hunchback Quasimodo. His makeup is nothing short of astounding. With this set you also get a short collection of 3D stills that may be viewed (3D glasses are included), a collection of flat 2D stills and publicity items, a few minutes of silent footage of Chaney on the set of the picture (out of costume and makeup), and also a few minutes of a very early film appearance of Chaney called Alas And Alak made in 1913.

It is a complete merging into a character, unlike few performances that one can find these days when celebrities take over characters for their own.  As with all silent film, the gestures are overblown and exaggerated, but in this one it works better because the characters are so strong.In terms of plot, you have a deformed man.  Rather than the blurb that says he has a heart of gold, I think he is full of rage at his maltreatment, and possibly mentally handicapped.  It is only when the ""gypsy"" Esmeralda shows him honest, human sympathy that he begins to grow out of the hatred bred in isolation.  BUt he is being used, as a slave, by the manipulative brother (who desires Esmeralda) of the good bishop of Notre Dame.  Then enters the handsome playboy, who falls for Esmeralda after pursuing her purely for pleasure.  After the evil brother attempts to assassinate his rival, only to have Esmeralda blamed and condemned to death.  Quasimodo rescues her, unleashing a frenzy of violent rage from the balcony of Notre Dame.The amazing thing is how moving the film is, how much sympathy Lon C can evoke even as he appears monstrous and even crazy.

Bowed under the 72-pound weight of a rubber hump that made it difficult for him to stand up straight, Chaney adopts a weird ape-like crouch, as though his legs were too rickety to support him, but which allows him to scuttle about in a manner frighteningly part-simian and part-arachnoid. Surprisingly eneptly mounted - considering its lavish budget - i.e. many social, religious and sexual abberations which were central to the Hugo novel are missing - and wretchedly directed by Wallace Worsley with a constant flurry of extras milling about, this famous silent film survives solely through Chaney's remarkable performance.

However, viewers will nevertheless be impressed by Lon Chaney's excellent portrayal of the  tragic Quasimodo.

Crucial to the film's story is the love affair that develops between the Captain of the Kings Guard, Phoebus (Norman Kerry) and the Gypsy dancer Esmeralda (Patsy Ruth Miller). Clopin loves Esmeralda, but she scorns his advances and seeks the love of Phoebus.  The two meet and fall in love.  Jehan sees their growing love for each other as the catalyst he has been looking for to send the people in revolt and overthrow the king.This version of THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME is notable for the fine performance of Lon Chaney.  Chaney was known as ""The Man of a Thousand Faces"" and Quasimodo is one of the more famous faces that modern audiences might recognize him as.  In a time in which makeup was not thought of positively and prosthetics were viewed as something unnecessary and burdensome, Chaney performed wonders with the makeup and prosthetics that he created almost entirely himself.  Just as impressive is his physical performance.  Partially assisted by a plaster hump that weighed about 15 pounds, Chaney portrays Quasimodo as a physically tortured creature weighed down by his deformities and forced to walk around like a strange hybrid between a monkey and a frog.  Younger viewers might laugh at the physical mannerisms, but they are quite impressive.I enjoyed watching THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, but I was somewhat disappointed by the overall storyline.  Hugo's story is a fascinating masterpiece and would make a great film if a filmmaker would stick to the story.  Unfortunately, filmmakers rarely do and change things around to make the story lighter and happier.  The antagonist of the original story is Don Claudio Frollo, a priest torn between his devotion to God and the struggle within himself between the love and lust for Esmeralda.  However, in this version of the story Frollo is rarely seen and is portrayed as a perfect saint.  Instead it is Frollo's brother, a relatively minor character in Hugo's story, who is turned into the villain.  Esmeralda and Phoebus also receive major character overhauls in this version of the story.  After hearing so many positive things about this film so long, I was disappointed by how much it deviates from Hugo's tale.However, the worst thing about this DVD is the transfer.  There are times when the film is scratchy and there are other times when parts of the film aren't lined up properly and are cut off from the screen.Nevertheless, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME is worth watching if you are a serious movie fan or have any interest in cinema history.",4,"Movie is 5 Stars, But DVD quality is only 3.",1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,3141,"['Adapted', 'famous', 'novel', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'THE', 'HUNCHBACK', 'OF', 'NOTRE', 'DAME', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Quasimodo', 'title', 'character', 'film', 'begins', 'people', 'Paris', 'reveling', 'celebrating', 'Feast', 'Fools', 'Quasimodo', 'watches', 'towers', 'famous', 'cathedral', 'Quasimodo', 'jealous', 'joy', 'people', 'However', 'curiosity', 'piqued', 'eventually', 'crowds', 'crowned', 'King', 'Fools', 'Meanwhile', 'Quasimodo', 'master', 'Jehan', 'Frollo', 'Brandon', 'Hurst', 'plots', 'King', 'Thieves', 'Clopin', 'Ernest', 'Torrence', 'starting', 'revolt', 'Crucial', 'film', 'story', 'love', 'affair', 'Captain', 'Kings', 'Guard', 'Phoebus', 'Norman', 'Kerry', 'Gypsy', 'dancer', 'Esmeralda', 'Patsy', 'Ruth', 'Miller', 'Clopin', 'Esmeralda', 'advances', 'love', 'Phoebus', 'two', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'Jehan', 'growing', 'love', 'other', 'catalyst', 'been', 'looking', 'send', 'people', 'revolt', 'overthrow', 'king.This', 'version', 'THE', 'HUNCHBACK', 'OF', 'NOTRE', 'DAME', 'notable', 'fine', 'performance', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Chaney', 'was', 'known', 'Man', 'Thousand', 'Faces', 'Quasimodo', 'one', 'more', 'famous', 'modern', 'audiences', 'might', 'recognize', 'as', 'time', 'makeup', 'was', 'not', 'thought', 'positively', 'prosthetics', 'were', 'viewed', 'something', 'unnecessary', 'burdensome', 'Chaney', 'performed', 'wonders', 'makeup', 'prosthetics', 'created', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Just', 'impressive', 'physical', 'performance', 'Partially', 'assisted', 'plaster', 'hump', 'weighed', '15', 'pounds', 'Chaney', 'Quasimodo', 'physically', 'tortured', 'creature', 'weighed', 'down', 'deformities', 'forced', 'walk', 'strange', 'hybrid', 'monkey', 'frog', 'Younger', 'viewers', 'might', 'laugh', 'physical', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'quite', 'impressive.I', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'THE', 'HUNCHBACK', 'OF', 'NOTRE', 'DAME', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'overall', 'storyline', 'Hugo', 'story', 'fascinating', 'masterpiece', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'filmmaker', 'would', 'stick', 'story', 'Unfortunately', 'filmmakers', 'rarely', 'do', 'change', 'things', 'make', 'story', 'lighter', 'happier', 'antagonist', 'original', 'story', 'Don', 'Claudio', 'Frollo', 'priest', 'torn', 'devotion', 'God', 'struggle', 'love', 'lust', 'Esmeralda', 'However', 'version', 'story', 'Frollo', 'rarely', 'seen', 'portrayed', 'perfect', 'saint', 'Instead', 'Frollo', 'brother', 'relatively', 'minor', 'character', 'Hugo', 'story', 'who', 'turned', 'villain', 'Esmeralda', 'Phoebus', 'also', 'receive', 'major', 'character', 'overhauls', 'version', 'story', 'hearing', 'so', 'many', 'positive', 'things', 'film', 'so', 'long', 'was', 'disappointed', 'how', 'much', 'Hugo', 'tale.However', 'worst', 'thing', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'film', 'scratchy', 'are', 'other', 'times', 'when', 'parts', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'lined', 'up', 'properly', 'are', 'cut', 'off', 'screen.Nevertheless', 'THE', 'HUNCHBACK', 'OF', 'NOTRE', 'DAME', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'serious', 'movie', 'fan', 'have', 'interest', 'cinema', 'history']",N/A

His audio commentary is insightful, and the accompanying print essay is great as well.  The 3-D stills are pretty cool, and I love the reproduction of the original theatrical program.
