836640,A39FKMQA81D2CX,B0002IQO0K,Carole,"[1, 1]","I've been doing the TransFirmer series for several months now.  I wanted a little variety in the cardio step routine, so I tried this disc on Netflix.  It uses a different box than the TransFirmer, but I thought it would be compatible.  For the most part it was, but there are times when she has you stand at the top of incline and then lean over.  And that doesn't work so well with the TransFirmer.There were many segments where she would have you standing/moving sideways to the tv, which makes it very difficult to follow along.  I thought that maybe I could just turn the step sideways and face forwards, but she keeps going from sideways to forwards to sideways, so that doesn't work.The ""stage"" is also very different from other Firm videos I've done.  Each instructor was on her own pedestal/platform and they were really spread out.  You generally only saw 3 instructors at once.  The beginner instructor was only rarely on screen.As for the routine itself, it was confusing to follow the first time, but that will happen with any new routine.  Her cueing was ok; there were only a couple of switches that I felt I missed because of bad cueing as opposed to it being an unfamiliar routine.  The music did make it hard to hear her sometimes.  I had to turn up the volume in order to hear her. All in all, though, I'm going to stick withThe Firm - Ultimate Calorie Blasterfor my step routine, and look for a floor cardio disc when I need variety.",3,Not the best step workout,1250812800,"08 21, 2009",2009,1453,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'TransFirmer', 'series', 'several', 'months', 'now', 'wanted', 'little', 'variety', 'cardio', 'step', 'routine', 'tried', 'disc', 'Netflix', 'different', 'box', 'TransFirmer', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'compatible', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'stand', 'top', 'incline', 'then', 'lean', ""n't"", 'work', 'so', 'well', 'TransFirmer.There', 'were', 'many', 'segments', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'standing/moving', 'sideways', 'tv', 'very', 'difficult', 'follow', 'along', 'thought', 'maybe', 'could', 'just', 'turn', 'step', 'sideways', 'face', 'forwards', 'going', 'sideways', 'forwards', 'sideways', ""n't"", 'work.The', 'stage', 'also', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'Firm', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'done', 'instructor', 'was', 'own', 'pedestal/platform', 'were', 'really', 'spread', 'out', 'generally', 'only', 'saw', '3', 'instructors', 'once', 'beginner', 'instructor', 'was', 'only', 'rarely', 'screen.As', 'routine', 'was', 'confusing', 'follow', 'first', 'time', 'will', 'happen', 'new', 'routine', 'cueing', 'was', 'ok', 'were', 'only', 'couple', 'switches', 'felt', 'missed', 'bad', 'cueing', 'opposed', 'being', 'unfamiliar', 'routine', 'music', 'did', 'make', 'hard', 'hear', 'sometimes', 'had', 'turn', 'up', 'volume', 'order', 'hear', ""'m"", 'going', 'stick', 'withThe', 'Firm', 'Ultimate', 'Calorie', 'Blasterfor', 'step', 'routine', 'look', 'floor', 'cardio', 'disc', 'when', 'need', 'variety']",N/A

836642,ASSU0CXA7ZCZK,B0002IQO0K,Julie,"[0, 1]","This workout is not new, but it is fairly new to me.  I normally prefer longer workouts ~ at least 45 minutes ~ and this one is only 30 minutes.  I do this one when I'm short on time and I still feel like I'm getting a good workout in.  I have done step aerobics for years, so the moves are all familiar to me and it didn't take long for me to keep up without missing a beat.  I give it my all and I always end up drenched in sweat, which lets me know I'm getting a good workout in.  I think Lisa is an excellent lead and she cues very well.  On days when I have more time, I add this workout in with another short workout that deals more with sculpting and that way I get good sculpting and good cardio in.  I don't have the Firm Box used in this video.  I use the TransFIRMer, which also has the incline option.

836644,A2AV37AKRQZSYY,B0002IQO0K,Lauren  B,"[15, 15]","First, I would like to comment on the review below. Obviously the previous reviewer has experienced bad luck vs. problems with The Firm. I have this DVD and know others that have it as well and I have never experienced any problems with getting the DVD to play whatsoever. That said, this is an awesome workout that will have you sweating in no time! I often hear people complain that they didn't know they had to have the Firm Box in order to do this workout. Well, you would if you read the information about the workout before purchasing. Anyone that exercises (and even those that don't) should know that there is quite possibly SOME equipment involved whether it be weights, bands, or a step box! Yes, you will need this special inclining box, but that is the greatest part. This step is superior to many others that can't best target your problem areas. It's not cheap, but at $60 for the entire system which includes four videos, you are really getting a steal. You would pay near that for just the videos alone. I also hear complaints of how hard the choreography is. That's another plus. It isn't hard, it just isn't familiar to most. You have to work at it. Watching the video four or five times will not help you get the steps down. You simply must jump in and attempt and eventually it will come to you. Even if you aren't doing the steps perfectly, you are still moving! And trust me, once you get the steps down you will be proud of yourself and better yet...you will never get bored with this or any of the other Firm tapes! That is the number one greatest thing about the Firm. It is NEVER BORING! No matter how many times I have done this tape (probably 30 or so), it seems like a new workout every time. I love The Firm! Try it! And don't give up because you think the choreography is too hard. They can't stop and explain each move because your heart rate won't stay up that way. Even if they had a separate tape explaining each move, there are so many that you would pay nearly double just trying to learn moves. I am advanced with The Firm and I find that I am still learning new moves each time, but that's the fun part!

836645,A13700AF4X40YG,B0002IQO0K,Loves Books in MD,"[2, 3]","The Firm had a series that used what some people refer to as ""The Death Box"" and this is one of them.  From what I can tell from those I own, the sound quality of the production was not as good as in the past or in the future and I often find it difficult to hear the instructor's cues, in large part because the music competes.This delivers a good cardio workout, but it's another of those that has the complex footwork that I struggle to learn, despite having virtually every Firm workout they've made.  I suppose in the name of providing a quick, intense cardio workout, there is no instruction for what I find the complicated steps.  As a result, it'll either take you a few uses of the routine to nail it or, if you're [...] like me and insist on being able to master the footwork before moving on, you can wind up with a marathon workout.I substitute my Transfirmer (more recent era and still sold as of July, 2007 at Amazon, Target, Dick's Sporting Goods or Firm Direct for the box (step with narrow fold up and down legs) and it works just fine.  A Reebok Step would also substitute nicely.Had the sound quality been better and the routine not quite so frustrating, I'd have probably given this one a 5.  Once mastered, it does seem to be one of the few Firm workouts that is short - and the use of weights more for increased cardio intensity than sculpting (especially if you're used to using heavy weights).",4,More from the Tricky Footwork Era,1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,1417,"['Firm', 'had', 'series', 'used', 'what', 'people', 'refer', 'Death', 'Box', 'one', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'own', 'sound', 'quality', 'production', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'past', 'future', 'often', 'find', 'difficult', 'hear', 'instructor', 'cues', 'large', 'part', 'music', 'competes.This', 'good', 'cardio', 'workout', 'complex', 'footwork', 'struggle', 'learn', 'having', 'virtually', 'Firm', ""'ve"", 'made', 'suppose', 'name', 'providing', 'quick', 'intense', 'cardio', 'workout', 'instruction', 'what', 'find', 'complicated', 'steps', 'result', ""'ll"", 'either', 'take', 'few', 'uses', 'routine', 'nail', ""'re"", '[', ']', 'insist', 'being', 'able', 'master', 'footwork', 'moving', 'can', 'wind', 'up', 'marathon', 'workout.I', 'substitute', 'Transfirmer', 'more', 'recent', 'era', 'still', 'sold', 'July', '2007', 'Amazon', 'Target', 'Dick', 'Sporting', 'Goods', 'Firm', 'Direct', 'box', 'step', 'narrow', 'fold', 'up', 'down', 'legs', 'just', 'fine', 'Reebok', 'Step', 'would', 'also', 'substitute', 'nicely.Had', 'sound', 'quality', 'been', 'better', 'routine', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'frustrating', ""'d"", 'have', 'probably', 'given', 'one', '5', 'Once', 'mastered', 'seem', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'Firm', 'short', 'use', 'weights', 'more', 'increased', 'cardio', 'intensity', 'sculpting', 'especially', ""'re"", 'used', 'using', 'heavy', 'weights']",N/A
836646,A2IOP3U5E7AI7G,B0002IQO0K,MN Walker,"[4, 5]","I tried this dvd for the first time today. I had previewed it and was expecting to struggle a lot with the footwork. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I had few problems following the steps. I have been using the dvds for the Transfirmer the past 3 months and have all of the footwork for those dvds down. So if you have been using the Transfirmer series, this would be a good one to add to your collection. I don't have the step used in this dvd, but used my transfirmer step in the incline position when needed. I also used the green 6 inch portion of the step for the step sequences. It worked great.I like the 30 minute length of this dvd - it's a fast paced, intense workout. I had a good sweat going by the end of it. I consider myself to be a fit, intermediate exerciser. I used 3 pounds weights and think I'll stick with that for a while. I had a few fumbles with the footwork at times, but was able to get back in step quickly. I expect that the first time I do a new step workout. I thought the instructor cued well. The Firm instructors are top notch and she was no exception. Other reviewers have described the activities of the dvd well, so I won't go into that.The 30 minutes went by quickly and I really enjoyed the workout.

836649,ATKVDKXO3Q6ZM,B0002IQO0K,Teedums,"[3, 3]","This is another video from the Firm's third Body Sculpting system which uses the 3 in 1 Firm Box which can be used in a 6 inch position for aerobics, 14 inches for leg press, or in a incline position to up the intensity for aerobics and to be used for lunges.  If you do not have the box a normal step will work, you will also need a pair of light weights.The workout in it's entirety is about 30 minutes.  Lisa Kay leads this workout with 4 of her fellow master instructors, one of which always shows beginner modifications. Lisa has led a handful of videos and does a good job in this one as always, although in a few of the segments I thought the cueing could have been better.There are 4 cardio segments aside from the warmup and cooldown. The first 3 use the box in the 6 inch position. The first segment features step knees, repeaters, V-steps, jacks etc. The second is more of a 4 limb section using light weights but using the box more as well. There are dips, squats, and other moves incorporated with shoulder work using the light weights. I used 3 lb weights and my heartrate was plenty high, I would say this is the most difficult segment in the workout, at least it was for me. The third section features A-steps, L-steps over the tops, turn steps, and other moves, this is probably the trickiest combination and may take a few tries to get down. The fourth segment is more 4 limb using the box in the incline position. You will do lunges onto the incline with some bicep curls, then some dips with biceps etc.By the time you have reached the cooldown you have definitely worked, and will be glad it's the end, they make the most of 30 minutes that's for sure.
