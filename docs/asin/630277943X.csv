It's plot is simple, but the acting is serpurb and the man vs. man conflict helps us remember just what some people will do to keep two people apart merely for namesake or money.

When his mother finds out that he  wants to marry this girl, the mother runs an investigative report on the  girl to get all the dirt she can get on her.  But the son is only angry  with his mother, because the girl's past before she was born doesn't matter  to him.  He loves her.He calls her on the phone and asks her to marry  him.  He then goes and gets his best friend to be his best man at the  justice of the peace and then they, in turn go get Nancy, the  painter.While on their way to get married, there is a terrible  automobile crash, which lands all three of them in the hospital.  The car  crash was a great work of cinemetography and Nancy's entire body was  half-way in the front seat, half out the front dash window.When Steven  Collins wakes up he finds out that his friend was released from the  hospital with hardly a scratch.  He asks his mother about Nancy.  He does  not know that the mother made a deal with the girl that if the mother got  the girl's face fixed (which was totally destroyed by the car crash) and  the mother would pay in excess of a hundred thousand dollars, that the girl  would no longer see her son.  So the deal was made and the mother tells her  son that the girl did not make it.Over the next year or so, the girl's  face is restructured and Kathleen Quinlan looked beautiful.  She changed  her name to Marie Adams and went on to be a famous photographer who still  painted.  It was at one of her art shows that her boyfriend's best friend  sees her work.  He tells her, because he does not recognize her, that his  friend has a building in California and they would like to buy her artwork  to put in this building.Of course, she recognized the friend, so she  turns him down.  He can't understand why she would turn down so generous an  offer.  He goes and tells his friend about this great artist named Marie  Adams that will not sell her art to him.So Steven Collins goes to see  her work and her, and he feels like they've met, but he does not get the  connection of her being Nancy.  After all, his mean old mother told him  Nancy was dead.The story progresses nicely and they find each other  again at a place in Boston where they hid a costume necklace in the ground.  She is trying to find the necklace but he has it.  He now knew who she was  because he saw a painting she had not finished before the accident, which  was hanging completed on another man's wall.&quot;You can't have this  necklace.  It belonged to a friend of mine.  A friend I was told had died  over a year ago in a car crash.&quot;Then Nancy knew what the man's  mother had done.Don't you just LOVE happy endings?If you have not  seen this movie, you should buy it.  It is not real expensive and it's  great viewing on TV.

Litton,"[27, 28]","Combing the entire city of Wilmington for a video rental store which carried a copy of The Promise was not an easy task, but after finally watching it, I knew that my quest had been a total success. This movie will  always remain one of my most favored movies. Kathleen Quinlan and Stephen  Collins play two lovers who plan to get married, even after Collin's mother  expresses her detestment of the union. While on the way to getting married,  the two are in a tragic wreck, leaving Collins in a coma and Quinlan with a  series of horrid facial scars which cannot be removed unless by plastic  surgery. Collin's mother plays her key part at this point, offering her  money to pay for Quinlan's surgery if she will leave town and never try to  contact Collins again. This is one of those classic love stories where you  actually root for the two lovers to get back together, and an antagonist  whom you totally despise. The settings, plot, and locations for this movie  unfold like a great canvas, and the acting is what truly paints each detail  for this mosaic of storytelling. This movie is no disappointment; it is a  masterpiece, one for all to see.
