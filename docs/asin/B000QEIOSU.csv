1075247,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000QEIOSU,,"[5, 5]","More of a self-help guide for the Zen needy, PEACEFUL WARRIOR does have some good acting, a solid (albeit schmaltzy) message, and some amazing filming using light and shade.Loosely based on Dan Millman's autobiographical novel ""Way of the Peaceful Warrior"", the film focuses on Millman's over-inflated ego during his time as a super-gymnast yet having dark dreams related to failure. Unable to sleep, Dan (played by Scott Mechlowicz) frequents the streets of Berkeley, California in the wee hours of the morning only to stumble across a wise Zen-like master with no name whom Dan labels as ""Socrates."" Socrates (Nick Nolte,Off the Black) sees Dan's misguided spirit as a challenge and eventually allows Dan to see a path to inner enlightenment via the ""here and now.""Initially Dan sees this as shamanistic rubbish but quickly learns that he can apply Socrates' knowledge to help better his gymnastic abilities. Still focused on selfishness (wanting to win Olympic Gold) Dan finds himself injured after a horrific motorcycle accident and must come to terms with the fact that he may never walk again.With the help of Socrates, Dan not only walks but does the impossible.The message of the film is valid if you believe in such things as focusing energy only on the ""now"" and ""throwing out the trash"" that rattles around in your head every minute of every day. Doing so, according to Millman's philosophy, will allow you to become not only a better person, but a better whatever-you-are in your professional life.Mechlowicz and Nolte play well off each other, one being the cocky upstart and the other a wise and patient sage (perhaps even a ghost).But the real winner here is the light and shading of much of the film's images, especially whenever Mechlowicz enters the gas station where Nolte's character works. The dark aspect of the station gradually lightens up as Millman comes to accept what he's being taught. Also the motorcycle crash that injures Millman is done in fine slow-motion action with acrobatics to stop the heart of most movie watchers.All in all it's good film. Not great. But visually it certainly is a treat to watch.",4,The Cocky Upstart And The Sage Meet On The Zen Plain,1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,2138,"['More', 'self-help', 'guide', 'Zen', 'needy', 'PEACEFUL', 'WARRIOR', 'have', 'good', 'acting', 'solid', 'schmaltzy', 'message', 'amazing', 'filming', 'using', 'light', 'shade.Loosely', 'based', 'Dan', 'Millman', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'Way', 'Peaceful', 'Warrior', 'film', 'Millman', 'over-inflated', 'ego', 'time', 'super-gymnast', 'yet', 'having', 'dark', 'dreams', 'related', 'failure', 'Unable', 'sleep', 'Dan', 'played', 'Scott', 'Mechlowicz', 'streets', 'Berkeley', 'California', 'wee', 'hours', 'morning', 'only', 'stumble', 'wise', 'Zen-like', 'master', 'name', 'whom', 'Dan', 'Socrates', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Off', 'Black', 'Dan', 'misguided', 'spirit', 'challenge', 'eventually', 'Dan', 'see', 'path', 'inner', 'enlightenment', 'here', 'now', 'Initially', 'Dan', 'shamanistic', 'rubbish', 'quickly', 'can', 'apply', 'Socrates', 'knowledge', 'help', 'better', 'gymnastic', 'abilities', 'Still', 'focused', 'selfishness', 'wanting', 'win', 'Olympic', 'Gold', 'Dan', 'injured', 'horrific', 'motorcycle', 'accident', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'fact', 'may', 'never', 'walk', 'help', 'Socrates', 'Dan', 'not', 'only', 'walks', 'impossible.The', 'message', 'film', 'valid', 'believe', 'such', 'things', 'focusing', 'energy', 'only', 'now', 'throwing', 'out', 'trash', 'head', 'minute', 'day', 'Doing', 'so', 'according', 'Millman', 'philosophy', 'will', 'allow', 'become', 'not', 'only', 'better', 'person', 'better', 'whatever-you-are', 'professional', 'life.Mechlowicz', 'Nolte', 'play', 'well', 'other', 'one', 'being', 'cocky', 'upstart', 'other', 'wise', 'patient', 'sage', 'perhaps', 'even', 'ghost', 'real', 'winner', 'here', 'light', 'shading', 'much', 'film', 'images', 'especially', 'whenever', 'Mechlowicz', 'gas', 'station', 'where', 'Nolte', 'character', 'dark', 'aspect', 'station', 'gradually', 'up', 'Millman', 'accept', 'what', 'being', 'taught', 'Also', 'motorcycle', 'crash', 'Millman', 'done', 'fine', 'slow-motion', 'action', 'acrobatics', 'stop', 'heart', 'most', 'movie', 'watchers.All', 'good', 'film', 'Not', 'great', 'visually', 'certainly', 'treat', 'watch']",N/A
1075248,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000QEIOSU,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[8, 9]","Dan Mellman (Scott Mechlowicz) was a golden boy.  Having the world at his feet, he enjoyed being the star gymnast on a star team for The University of California, Berkeley.  But there was something missing.  Going through girlfriends, including stealing his best friend's, Dan had a cocky attitude that kept him empty and up at night.  Fortunately, his three A.M. sojourns for snacks at an all-night gas station lead him to a mysterious, older man sarcastically nicknamed Socrates (Nick Nolte) who seems like Yoda, but in all seriousness.  In his peace arsenal is the ability to startle someone by getting up on the garage roof when no one is paying attention.  Here they meet, and the sage man offers wisdom that is only greeted with a sneer and Dan's smart mouth.  Offering more than change for snacks, he also tries to relieve insomnia.  (""People are afraid of the inside--That's where everything important is."")  The meetings recur, but so does Dan's dream life that bring omens of misfortune.  In some of those dreams we see impressive confrontations from two forms of Dan.  (One I believe represents his ego, and the other is his spirit, and the unsettling division presented show us the split of a person yearning for the whole.)  Dan needs to ""let go of his ego"". Tragedy then does visit as his unconscious foretells, and he must deal with it.  But his recuperation needs more than crutches, he needs a steady guide to cope with his inner fracture as well.'Peaceful Warrior' is a unique and excellent adventure.  It could have been good as an inspiring sports' film, but it goes beyond that.  The sparring between Dan's ego and Socrates' wisdom creates another whole venue, complete with scenes that show Dan coming to grips with himself.  Nolte plays Socrates with grizzled beard and gravelly voice, but shows us a peace warrior who is no wimp.  Confronting Dan quietly, he gives him the strength to confront himself.  Some of the joy of this movie is listening to Dan and Socrates espouse their wisdom, like Greek teacher and student.  'Peaceful Warrior' could have been a hokey failure, but they really deliver in this refreshing film choice.

1075250,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B000QEIOSU,AIROLF,"[5, 7]","Nick Nolte (Affliction, Another 48 Hrs) is a philosophical preacher, the Socrates through which the real Dan Millman chooses to deliver his message. Based on Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives, a self-help book that's everyone apparently read and been inspired by, this movie stands on shaky feet, much like its main character. The philosophical sound bites are overwhelming. It would've been nice to see one or two of those ideas fully developed in the movie, but instead, Peaceful Warrior tries to cater to too many people and to appeal with too many one-liners.The most intriguing character isn't Socrates or even Dan Millman, who is played by the handsome and buffed-for-this-role Scott Mechlowicz (EuroTrip, Mean Creek), but is the elusive girl named Joy (Amy Smart Just Friends, The Butterfly Effect), who appears for about three minutes in the entire film. We never find out how she is related to Socrates or why she chooses to believe in Millman or even decides to associate herself with a jock like him.The beginning and the ending sequences are artistically shot as are a few other scenes of Millman training in the rain. If more scenes were this artfully executed, perhaps the lack of coherency and stability would've been less noticeable.Several Western ideas are challenged in this movie - living until that something that we all think we'll make us happier rather than the Eastern belief of living in this moment. However, there aren't any new or Earth-shaking revelations in this movie. Being in the ""now"" and experiencing two hours worth of this movie seems wasteful and contradictory.Universal decided to re-release this movie and gave away $15 million worth of free tickets in hope that there would be positive word-of-mouth about this movie, enough to generate huge ticket sales. I'm sorry to say that they will not be getting such positive feedback from me. I think a smarter move would've been to promote this movie on DVD, where it will do fine and where the watching of it might be spaced out over a few days, so that the philosophical talk isn't so heavily prevalent in such a short period of time.To paraphrase the movie's philosopher, you can't be better than anyone else, just like you can't be less than anyone else, but you can definitely have better movies than this one.

1075259,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000QEIOSU,Brian E. Erland,"[71, 79]","Based on allegedly actual events chronicled in Dan Millman's book `Way of the Peaceful Warrior' the film `Peaceful Warrior' released in `05 takes the audience on a shamanic spiritual journey in the most unlikely of places, a twentieth century urban center, more precisely, Berkley, California.Synopsis: Dan Millman is a top gymnast at U. C. Berkley yet despite his many successes he feels empty and incomplete inside. Plagued by dreams of failure Dan is unable to sleep and finds himself wandering the streets in the early hours of the morning. When he stops at an all night gas station and service mart he meets a man of unconventional wisdom who begins to instruct him on the process of clearing his mind of all the useless garbage it contains in order to view himself and the world around him in a brand new way.`Peaceful Warrior' is one of those rare films that both entertains and teaches without sacrificing one for the other. The production values are high, the dialogue believable and the performances strong. Scott Mechlowicz was definitely the right choice to play the role of Berkley gymnast Dan Millman and Nick Nolte delivers one of his best performances in years as the mysterious Socrates, garage attendant and ""New Age"" Zen Master.

Based on Dan Millman's real life story, Nick Nolte is wonderful in the role of Socrates, and Scott Mechlowicz does an absolutely amazing job playing Dan Millman. When Dan is feeling profoundly unhappy and dissatisfied despite being handsome, athletic and an award-winning gymnast, he wanders alone late at night to find spiritual nourishment and mentoring from a wise mechanic at a service station. Socrates provides Dan with the keys to open his doorways to intuitive and spiritual perception in such a way that Dan begins to see the world and himself in a whole new way. This reframing becomes incredibly important when Dan shatters his leg in a motorcycle accident, and finds he will no longer be eligible to pursue his lifelong dream of competing in the Olympics. What happens after the accident is where PEACEFUL WARRIOR really takes off, as it illustrates the power and grace we are all capable of achieving when we learn to live an examined life; for in learning to pay attention we can ease much of the suffering we cause ourselves in the way we react to our life experiences.

Gupton ""Author of spiritual growth books.""","[4, 4]","The inspirational unfolding of a young man, who at such a young college age, realizes there's more to life than beer, fun, sex and girls. How refreshing to sit back and watch this movie!Anyone with an ounce of purpose or passion can relate to this fabulous story. Who doesn't have a dream?I was given this DVD by a friend of mine. It sat on the bookshelf for about a month until I was bored and decided to watch a movie. So, I popped 'Peaceful Warrior' into the DVD player. Not knowing what to expect (I had never heard of Dan Millman), I must say I was intriqued from the beginning. I was also elated to read that it was inspired by true events.I watched it a second time within 24 hours and a third time only a week later.Yes, one must empty the trash they've accumulated over the years from parents, education, and society. Discovering who we really are and what we can accomplish comes from separating ourselves from the collected garbage into a KNOWING.Dan had a fascination for mystique when Socrates was introduced in the movie. The mind is inquisitive about things it doesn't understand. Thankfully, in his case, as in the lives of many others, the drawing unto us what we need, when we need it, does not go unfulfilled - even in the midst of the seeming ignorance surrounding us.The time has come when more and more people are realizing their higher capacity of intelligence, wisdom, and purpose.As a child, I was in an auto accident. Like Dan, I had crushed bones. And, like Dan, I recovered miraculously to perfection in a short time despite warnings and dire predictions from the medical profession.Nothing is impossible (to God). My experience was over 50 years ago, and just last year my old school principle (now in his eighty's) told me he never forgot it.Like Dan's classmates, my friends also wanted to know about the 'magic'. But like Dan said, ""It ISN'T magic"". (And, as we all know, magic is an illusion, anyway!)What time is it, Dan? It's NOW (as he realized). That's the only time we have. Use it to perfection.If this movie does nothing more than make someone THINK about endless possibilities, it has done its good. If it makes someone ACT to achieve those endless possibilities, it has done even more good.

Such is the case for PEACEFUL WARRIOR.  Based on a book by Inspirational Guru Dan Millman and beautifully adapted for the screen by Kevin Bernhardt, the story combines the best in sport stories with the infusion of spiritual discovery that despite the abundance of 'Hallmark-like' imitations, stands nobly as a tool for introducing young people to a journey toward self discovery well worth taking.  Director Victor Salva had the good sense not to push the story over the top, but instead to let his actors and situations grow logically into a practical demonstration of spiritual growth.Dan Millman (Scott Mechlowicz) is a gymnast bent on perfecting his skills to enter the Olympic trials.  He is a fine athlete but has an ego that consumes everything around him and prevents his finding a focus to be the perfect athlete he feels he can become.  After a chance encounter with a mysterious Service Station attendant whom Dan calls Socrates (Nick Nolte), Dan's inner struggles begin to surface as he sees and experiences troubling 'other-worldly' responses form Socrates.  He is ultimately forced to confront that he is living for pride, for accomplishment, for competition, for recognition - yet his quiet moments remain discontent.  Socrates works with Dan, helping him to find his inner self and to live in the moment.  Dan suffers a life-threatening motorcycle accident that appears to doom his dreams of being the finest gymnast, but Socrates helps him discover that living in the moment, giving in to the power of focus on the present, can result in overcoming the seemingly impossible obstacles.Rather than 'preach' these concepts, the story is illustrated by physical feats of gymnastics and by meaningful encounters between Dan and Socrates, and it is this technique that brings the film above the usual 'inspirational flicks' to become a truly compelling movie.  Nick Nolte has never been better as the subdued, understated, but immensely impressive Socrates. Scott Mechlowicz thankfully underplays the character of Dan: the use of a body double to perform the incredible gymnastic turns is seamlessly achieved. The remainder of the cast includes such fine actors as Amy Smart, Agnes Bruckner, and Ashton Holmes. This is a well-made film that deserves our attention, especially now.

It did seem like the story was rushed or that something was just generally missing.The story starts following an amateur college gymnast, named Dan, who is at the top of his game and living life to its fullest. One night at a gas station, or I should say service station, he meets a man named Socrates, who surprises him and pushes the boundaries of Dan's reality. Dan continues to go back and visit Socrates and eventually agrees to become his student. Meeting a young woman named Joy who seems to be on the path as well.  Socrates teaches Dan in the art of Zen, and Taoism, with some supernatural mysticism thrown in for good measure.Dan, who is really moving along in his studies as a student of life, still drives his motorcycle like a maniac and could easily kill himself or another, has a really horrible motorcycle accident and breaks his leg ruining his dream of being an Olympic athlete. After getting out of the hospital he continues to run into Joy and she tells him that he may have a chance to date her, but it is Socrates that tells him that he must still do what he loves and continue to train for the Olympics. Which he does and does manage to make the Olympic qualifier. The text narration at the end of the film tells you that Dan never made it to the Olympics, but did win some medals.I thought that the lesson in the movie was going to be that you should not cling to things because ultimately everything falls away.

There are enough truthful nuggets contained that many like me came away with the experience of having gained something important.  The whole idea of a mind filled with thoughts that are trash was empowering because it suggests that we can improve our thinking by ""taking out the trash.""  This made me think of one of my favorite quotes fromThe Urantia Book, ""At first life was a struggle for existence; now, for a standard of living; next it will be for quality of thinking, the coming earthly goal of human existence."" (p. 910)  This certainly fits with the main theme of the film.  Perhaps to be as meaningful as I found this, you have to be in a business where you constantly experience rejection, comparisons that others may be better than you, and the resulting emotions that create mental static, keeping you from your best work.  So I found it easy to apply this principal to many other fields other than gymnastics, which the film uses so well.  It gets to the heart of the bookRemember, Be Here Now, living fully in the moment.As a film, I enjoyed Scott Mechlowicz's Dan Millman.  He certainly nailed the arrogance and self-assertion of one who feels superior.  His rocky transition to Socrates' student worked well, particularly the scenes where he sits on the Plymouth trying to have an important thought.  Nick Nolte showed why he has had such a long career as an actor, embodying wisdom with certainty and calmness.  His character Socrates is so often stern, that it was the scene where Dan is crying in the car and Nolte's Socrates approaches him, his eyes so sympathetic, that made me realize how perfectly he did the role.  Amy Smart as the bright-eyed mystical student of Socrates delivers a deep performance in her time on screen.  Tim DeKay who has been on so many series that I've watched does a great job as Coach Garrick.  Ashton Holmes turns in an excellent performance as Tommy, the vulnerable athlete that Dan abuses and to whom Dan apologizes.  The scene where Tommy wants to study as Dan has, totally missing the point, lost in his mental trash, was splendid.The screenplay was a bit uneven, making it seem like we were going to watch a magical apprenticeship and then moving more to a coming of age story with a splash of romance.  But I got so much from the film that it is one I greatly appreciated having seen.

According to previous reviews this movie has been out since last summer. I received free tickets to see this courtesy of blockbuster, otherwise I probably would have never came across this movie. Dan Millman is a gymnast who is a popular jock and seems to have it all. Dan has a great body, good looks, and has a charm that allows him to get almost any girl. All this seems to be great for Dan's ego, but deep down inside he is far from happy. He starts to have these violent dreams that keep him up late at night. One night when Dan can not sleep he wanders in to a service station and meets a mysterious man. This man who Dan calls ""Socrates"" will help take him on one of the most amazing journeys of his life. This journey will become one of the most important things when Dan has a motorcycle accident and shatters one of his legs along with his dreams of being in the Olympics. Peaceful Warrior is based on a book, and the movie is one of the most inspiring movies to come out in a very long time.

This is never answered and I had hoped it would be. Beyond that is a story of a young man whos hopes and dreams are shattered by a motorcycle accident that seriously damaged his leg. His dream was to compeat in the Olympics, but he is shut out because the bones in one of his legs is shattered and held together by a metal rod. Hes told by medical experts that he will be lucky to walk again. But through the guidance of this Socrates individual our young man finds spiritual and human reality and truth within himself that gives him the incredible ability to do the impossible. Who or what Socrates was is meant to be undiscovered, for Socrates him self would have said such interests are not what is most important. What is important is that when a human being is totally and completely purified in the meaning of perfect harmonious existance he is capable of miracles.

1075310,A2ZV7BXTMFWBIH,B000QEIOSU,Vulcanicus,"[1, 1]",This movie even after 3 viewings inspires me with it depiction of how altering your mind can alter your life. I really liked the under acted method that Nick Nolte used in his Socrates characterization. It was succinct and to the point each time and moved the central character on to further inspiration and motivation to advance back in his gymnastic career.I feel the movie did the book justice as well and stayed on course with Socrates teaching. Being in the moment totally or the now was vividly demonstrated when the gymnast did the horse routine brilliantly with no prior training or coaching. Also the scene where he tunes in for the first time to whats going on around him in the park by amplifying his senses was fascinating and showed our potential for truly focusing externally and opening up to what's out there all the time. I am sure a lot of people will consider this movie a fantasy. However there will be a smaller percentage that will see what its saying and pursue getting the written material for further exploration of the human races potential.,5,Silencing the Mind,1274140800,"05 18, 2010",2010,1067,"['movie', 'even', '3', 'viewings', 'inspires', 'depiction', 'how', 'altering', 'mind', 'can', 'alter', 'life', 'really', 'liked', 'acted', 'method', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'used', 'Socrates', 'characterization', 'was', 'succinct', 'point', 'time', 'moved', 'central', 'character', 'further', 'inspiration', 'motivation', 'advance', 'back', 'gymnastic', 'career.I', 'feel', 'movie', 'did', 'book', 'justice', 'as', 'well', 'stayed', 'course', 'Socrates', 'teaching', 'Being', 'moment', 'totally', 'now', 'was', 'vividly', 'demonstrated', 'when', 'gymnast', 'did', 'horse', 'routine', 'brilliantly', 'prior', 'training', 'coaching', 'Also', 'scene', 'where', 'first', 'time', 'whats', 'going', 'park', 'amplifying', 'senses', 'was', 'fascinating', 'showed', 'potential', 'truly', 'focusing', 'externally', 'opening', 'up', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'time', 'am', 'sure', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'consider', 'movie', 'fantasy', 'However', 'will', 'be', 'smaller', 'percentage', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'saying', 'pursue', 'getting', 'written', 'material', 'further', 'exploration', 'human', 'potential']",N/A
1075311,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000QEIOSU,Wuchak,"[1, 3]","""Peaceful Warrior"" (2006) is one of those 'almost good' films. It's a worthwhile movie but it's too formulaic and just seems to lack the necessary mojo to pull it out its pedestrian plotting.Based on Dan Millman's hit 1980 book that I've never read, ""Peaceful Warrior"" is reminiscent of ""The Karate Kid"" and ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"" albeit with gymnastics substituting for martial arts.Although I enjoyed the constant stream of wisdom that flowed from Nick Nolte's character, ""Socrates,"" the film took a wrong turn with him almost immediately by implying that he had the power to instantaneously levitate 15 feet. From there it gets even weirder. By the end of the film one wonders if he's even real at all. I felt this took away from his character rather than make him more intriguing. Regardless, Nolte does a respectable job in the role and, again, I did enjoy his many gems of wisdom throughout. Some say his philosophies reflects a Buddhist mindset, but I saw Biblical Christianity. For instance:- The stress on service and humility, i.e. servanthood.- ""Putting out the trash,"" i.e. putting off the old man (the flesh) and putting on the new (the spirit).- Random thoughts are not you but they can become you if you embrace them and allow them to control/lead you.- Joy despite the mundane.- Discerning the real spirit of others (in the compassionate sense, although sometimes for protection).- Give to those who ask of you.- Turning the cheek as one's initial response to antagonism (but, keep in mind, you only have two cheeks, facially speaking).And much more. These are axioms, universal truths that are true regardless of one's lineage, culture or present belief system. It's this aspect and the character of Socrates that make the film worthwhile.Other than that, though, the story is too formulaic. The plot mechanics are just too obvious. The viewer's aware of the contrivances just as much as the peripheral actors, who fail to pull off the material because of it. But the main four or so actors do a splendid job despite these negatives (Nolte, Scott Mechlowicz, Amy Smart and Agnes Bruckner).GRADE: C+",3,Great bits of wisdom with contrivances,1322870400,"12 3, 2011",2011,2122,"['Peaceful', 'Warrior', '2006', 'one', ""'almost"", 'good', 'films', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'too', 'formulaic', 'just', 'lack', 'necessary', 'mojo', 'pull', 'out', 'pedestrian', 'plotting.Based', 'Dan', 'Millman', 'hit', '1980', 'book', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Peaceful', 'Warrior', 'reminiscent', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Dragon', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'Story', 'gymnastics', 'substituting', 'martial', 'arts.Although', 'enjoyed', 'constant', 'stream', 'wisdom', 'flowed', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'character', 'film', 'took', 'wrong', 'turn', 'almost', 'immediately', 'implying', 'had', 'power', 'instantaneously', 'levitate', '15', 'feet', 'even', 'weirder', 'end', 'film', 'one', 'even', 'real', 'felt', 'took', 'away', 'character', 'rather', 'make', 'more', 'intriguing', 'Regardless', 'Nolte', 'respectable', 'job', 'role', 'again', 'did', 'enjoy', 'many', 'gems', 'wisdom', 'say', 'philosophies', 'Buddhist', 'mindset', 'saw', 'Biblical', 'Christianity', 'instance', 'stress', 'service', 'humility', 'i.e', 'servanthood.-', 'Putting', 'out', 'trash', 'i.e', 'putting', 'off', 'old', 'man', 'flesh', 'putting', 'new', 'spirit', '.-', 'Random', 'thoughts', 'are', 'not', 'can', 'become', 'embrace', 'allow', 'control/lead', 'you.-', 'Joy', 'mundane.-', 'Discerning', 'real', 'spirit', 'others', 'compassionate', 'sense', 'sometimes', 'protection', '.-', 'Give', 'who', 'ask', 'you.-', 'Turning', 'cheek', 'one', 'initial', 'response', 'antagonism', 'keep', 'mind', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'cheeks', 'facially', 'speaking', '.And', 'much', 'more', 'are', 'axioms', 'universal', 'truths', 'are', 'true', 'regardless', 'one', 'lineage', 'culture', 'present', 'belief', 'system', 'aspect', 'character', 'Socrates', 'make', 'film', 'worthwhile.Other', 'though', 'story', 'too', 'formulaic', 'plot', 'mechanics', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'obvious', 'viewer', 'aware', 'contrivances', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'peripheral', 'actors', 'who', 'fail', 'pull', 'off', 'material', 'main', 'four', 'so', 'actors', 'do', 'splendid', 'job', 'negatives', 'Nolte', 'Scott', 'Mechlowicz', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'Agnes', 'Bruckner', '.GRADE', 'C+']",N/A
