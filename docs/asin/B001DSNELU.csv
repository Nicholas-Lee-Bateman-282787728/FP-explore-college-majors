Jones,"[3, 3]","I was a bit worried about buying this complete series box set as I thought it might have dated but rest assured it is just as current today as it was back then, maybe even more so.The Evans family are warm wonderful people and it's that charm that makes this series a true winner.I loved this entire box and found the episodes carried some right on topics and it was a nice surprise seeing baby Janet Jackson as Penny.Jimmie Walker aside as J.J. I felt it was the entire cast that made this show from John Amos stern but strong father figure to spiritually strong Mom, Ester Rolle.There are some interesting cameos of future stars too from Carl Weathers (Rocky), Louis Gossett Jr (Enemy Mine) to past stars Matthew ""Stymie"" Beard (Our Gang aka The Little Rascals).Good Times is good entertainment that is funny but also hammers home strong messages about life too, so right on, buy it.",5,"Good Times, Still Dyn-o-mite After All These Years",1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,885,"['was', 'bit', 'worried', 'buying', 'complete', 'series', 'box', 'set', 'thought', 'might', 'have', 'dated', 'rest', 'assured', 'just', 'current', 'today', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'so.The', 'Evans', 'family', 'are', 'warm', 'wonderful', 'people', 'charm', 'series', 'true', 'winner.I', 'loved', 'entire', 'box', 'found', 'episodes', 'carried', 'right', 'topics', 'was', 'nice', 'surprise', 'seeing', 'baby', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'Penny.Jimmie', 'Walker', 'aside', 'J.J', 'felt', 'was', 'entire', 'cast', 'made', 'show', 'John', 'Amos', 'stern', 'strong', 'father', 'figure', 'spiritually', 'strong', 'Mom', 'Ester', 'Rolle.There', 'are', 'interesting', 'cameos', 'future', 'stars', 'too', 'Carl', 'Weathers', 'Rocky', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr', 'Enemy', 'Mine', 'past', 'stars', 'Matthew', 'Stymie', 'Beard', 'Gang', 'Little', 'Rascals', '.Good', 'Times', 'good', 'entertainment', 'funny', 'also', 'home', 'strong', 'messages', 'life', 'too', 'so', 'right', 'buy']",Good Times: The Complete Series
1183126,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B001DSNELU,"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[0, 2]","I own this DVD set and have watched the series several times from beginning to end. I enjoyed all the seasons,even the more serious episodes and intend to review each season individually someday. This review is to comment not on each season as a whole but on Good Times as a whole. We start of mid decade with a complete family,including three children either in or beginning adolescence. There's a mother and a father looking always trying (and often unsuccessfully) to get his family out of the projects. By the final season the oldest children of the family were in school,engaged and/or gainfully employed....yet were all still living in the exact same project. In terms of familiarity this helped people to keep themselves involved in the series. In terms of Norman Lears ""tell it like it is"" attitude it's a bit flawed. All it took was a conversation with one of my friends well aware of that sort of living environment to realize that one family would be doubtful to live in the same project for six years with little change as the children began to prosper and move up in the world. I do realize they lost their breadwinning (sort of) father mid series but still to be entirely accurate it might've been better if the Evans family had moved out from that apartment they occupied...say after the fathers passing onto one slightly better place after another until they really were ""out of the ghetto"". The show could've still dealt with tough issues,even economic ones if this had been the case. Even so for what this show provided almost all the other issues and family situations dealt with in the show were pretty accurate and a lot of the times very entertaining. This baught the trials and tribulations of lower class life in the persona of an African American family into American homes without resorting to a lot of well know stereotypes of that side of life. And unlike actress Esther Rolle I wasn't bothered by JJ's comic antics. They served as a sense of release from the occasionally serious tone of the show and,several times provide the lone ""comedy"" element to the proceedings. He was not from episode to episode the only comic element.Often enough the comedy came from observational wit about the real life dialema's fast by the characters. It's an excellent TV show and more than worth anyones time to check out,especially if they're wondering where all the complaints by their elders about the ""junk on TV today"" actually comes from.",5,Aint' We Lucky We Got 'Em,1270771200,"04 9, 2010",2010,2456,"['own', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'watched', 'series', 'several', 'times', 'beginning', 'end', 'enjoyed', 'seasons', 'even', 'more', 'serious', 'episodes', 'intend', 'review', 'season', 'individually', 'someday', 'review', 'comment', 'not', 'season', 'whole', 'Good', 'Times', 'whole', 'start', 'mid', 'decade', 'complete', 'family', 'including', 'three', 'children', 'beginning', 'adolescence', 'mother', 'father', 'looking', 'always', 'trying', 'often', 'unsuccessfully', 'get', 'family', 'projects', 'final', 'season', 'oldest', 'children', 'family', 'were', 'school', 'engaged', 'and/or', 'gainfully', 'employed', '.yet', 'were', 'still', 'living', 'exact', 'same', 'project', 'terms', 'familiarity', 'helped', 'people', 'keep', 'involved', 'series', 'terms', 'Norman', 'Lears', 'tell', 'bit', 'flawed', 'took', 'was', 'conversation', 'one', 'friends', 'well', 'aware', 'sort', 'living', 'environment', 'realize', 'one', 'family', 'would', 'be', 'doubtful', 'live', 'same', 'project', 'six', 'years', 'little', 'change', 'children', 'began', 'prosper', 'move', 'up', 'world', 'do', 'realize', 'lost', 'breadwinning', 'sort', 'father', 'mid', 'series', 'still', 'be', 'entirely', 'accurate', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'Evans', 'family', 'had', 'moved', 'out', 'apartment', 'occupied', 'say', 'fathers', 'passing', 'one', 'slightly', 'better', 'place', 'really', 'were', 'ghetto', 'show', 'could', ""'ve"", 'still', 'dealt', 'tough', 'issues', 'even', 'economic', 'ones', 'had', 'been', 'case', 'Even', 'so', 'what', 'show', 'provided', 'almost', 'other', 'issues', 'family', 'situations', 'dealt', 'show', 'were', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'lot', 'times', 'very', 'entertaining', 'baught', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'lower', 'class', 'life', 'persona', 'African', 'American', 'family', 'American', 'homes', 'resorting', 'lot', 'well', 'know', 'stereotypes', 'side', 'life', 'actress', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'was', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'JJ', 'comic', 'antics', 'served', 'sense', 'release', 'occasionally', 'serious', 'tone', 'show', 'several', 'times', 'provide', 'lone', 'comedy', 'element', 'proceedings', 'was', 'not', 'episode', 'episode', 'only', 'comic', 'element.Often', 'comedy', 'came', 'observational', 'wit', 'real', 'life', 'dialema', 'fast', 'characters', 'excellent', 'TV', 'show', 'more', 'worth', 'anyones', 'time', 'check', 'out', 'especially', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'where', 'complaints', 'elders', 'junk', 'TV', 'today', 'actually']",Good Times: The Complete Series

Those were the days when every red-blooded boy of African descent knew in their heart of hearts that when we grew up, we were gonna become rich just so we could take Thelma out of the ghetto...then Keith showed up & ruined our plans.Seriously, it was always a great show, and i do understand some of the things that upset John Amos and Esther Rolle enough to leave the show (it appeared that those of our persuasion were almost always the subject of buffonery, even when tackling the serious subjects Good Times touched on over the years), but what i never did understand was the backlash that occured in later years, where people associated with the show developed shame because of it.  This show was nothing to be ashamed of, not even the bug-eyed clowning of J.J.Regarding this release, it's all here!  J.J. drug-addicted fiancee, pregnant girlfriend (by somebody else), and V.D. scare (look for a youthful Jay Leno & his chin in a guest-spot in this episode).  Thelma's romance with Ibe, her romance with the guy on work release, her romance with...aww, hell, ALL her romances.  Michael's militant stance and the famous phrase, ""'Boy' is a white racist word!""  And of course, the murder of a father figure (i call it murder because that's what it was...corporate murder of the black male figurehead.  Some can't understand & some just won't understand.  For instance, my 12 year old still teases my wife & i for getting teary-eyed over the line, ""damn, Damn, DAAAAAAAMN!"")My one complaint is a small one, but i must say the packaging design leaves a little to be desired.  The DVDs are stacked so that you can't remove one without having to remove all the previous ones.

1183134,A2K4G6SMXVP69R,B001DSNELU,Earline Taylor,"[1, 4]","i remember very well when this series began. i was a teen-ager and there was nothing else on television like it. eventhough i could identify somewhat with the ups and downs that the ""evans family"" situations portrayed, i just couldn't deal with the stereotyping of the show. i grew up in the neighborhood in which this show was ""set"" and the projects earlier on did not look that way. they only became that way later on. and the sort of questions that people who had never lived in a neighborhood like that would ask were ridiculous.what the show literally was about was a family struggling to survive. the chosen setting/s was a housing project in chicago, which i understand are now mostly gone. the infamous cabrini-green housing projects.""james evans"" the patriarch of the family was a strong father figure who took every kind of mediocre job under the sun to support his family, while his wife, ""florida evans"" was a stay home wife, {she went to work after james was killed in a car accident, at the beginning of season four}who was always trying to keep her husband encouraged through his ups and downs. then there were ""jj"" the wise cracking oldest son. followed by ""thelma"" the only daughter, who was always mercilously teasing ""jj"" about how ugly he was. then there was ""michael"" the militant brain of the children, who was always ready to challenge and debate someone about something.my all around favarite episodes were in season three when a love interest for thelma was introduced, ""larry,"" played by ""carl franklin."" he was only in two and i wish there had been a more developing of his character. in the first episode he appears in he and thelma are very much in love and they want to get married, against james's wishes, that is. then he gives in and allow them to get engaged, eventhough ""thelma"" gives ""larry"" his ring back.then in the second and last episode that he appears in, ""thelma"" feels that she and ""larry"" are growing apart and she is not sure what to do about it. then the decision is made when ""larry"" gets a call from his uncle, in california, giving him an opportunity to go there and work with him in his garage, which would earn him a partnership in the business. ""larry"" wants ""thelma"" to go with him, as his wife of course, but she don't want to go. the way she gets out of the relationship with ""larry"" was rather poignant and sad, though it was probably meant to be funny.here is a thought, in season six, instead of just having ""thelma"" to meet and marry keith, why not create some sort of love triangle, by bringing back ""larry."" she could have maybe been out shopping for her wedding and runs into him. he could be back because his uncle died and left him the business, netting him millions of dollars. now with his fortune he is in just as good of a position to offer her a secured future.she is now readily confused because she has accepted ""keith's"" proposal, who is an up and coming football star. or she can go with ""larry"" whom she never really quite got over. maybe ""larry"" could have shown up at the church and interrupted the wedding before the ""i do."" or something else interesting could have been added. i just did not like the way season six ended. it just seemed unfinished in my opinion, as if the entire staff was just ready to give it up. i think when a show has a ""planned ending"" it can sometimes end better than it does.oh come on! a baby for ""thelma"" and she and ""keith"", along with ""willona"" and ""penny"" with mom in tow, all wind up in the same neighborhood, by accident! oh gees. and how come ""florida"" was absent for season five because she is off on her honeymoon, but reappears in season six without so much as a mention of her husband? did the writers think that the viewers had forgotten about her ""recent remarriage?"" ""jj"" moves up and out and ""michael"" goes off to college. come on! i agree the series had to end some how but how come everything had to happen ""literally"" on the same day. i just wish that some of the ""endings"" had been a bit spreaded out, and perhaps made ""jj"" a bit more exciting too. like why not have him to have become engaged to one of his girlfriends! i vote for the plumber. wasn't her name ""tc""?{the second one, not the first one}i'm just not happy with the way this series ended. however, that was thirty years ago. ""florida evans"" played by ""esther rolle"" past away eleven years ago. so even if their roles could be reprised, ""florida"" would have to be recast. but so what! other television shows have been redone or updated. why not good times. just give them some kids and problems and they will be right in step with everyone else.oops! i forgot to talk alittle bit about season four. this is the season in which ""john amos"" who played ""james evans"" character was killed off the show. i did not like the way this was done. why not have him to have died at the end of season three. then open season four with his funeral. to me, that would have made more sense. and it would have been a good cliffhanger. eventhough i bought the entire series last year at the end of march, i still have not really viewed all of them.eventhough everyone at the time liked ""jj"" played by ""jimmie walker,"" i liked ""james."" i think he was doing a great service for the black community by playing a strong father figure who was always there and available to and for his family, in spite of their lack of money and his lack of education. as i said elsewhere in this review, this show i felt sometimes stereotyped us, as a race of people. but it still had the one thing it needed the most: a strong patriarch at the head of the family.",5,"i remember these ""good times""",1243468800,"05 28, 2009",2009,5612,"['i',

The whole idea is to be able to own the entire series at a reasonable price, and that means compact, no frills packaging. I am very pleased with my set. The discs are nicely stacked (on a spindle) and secured in the box. If you are careful with your DVDs, you won't have a problem. It's also a good idea to keep the cardboard cover on the discs for added security if you aren't going to buy sleeves.The inside has the title of each episode listed for every disc. There is no synopsis, but if you are a fan of the show the titles give the hint you need in most cases. You can get a complete description of every show just by going on the internet, and then print the episode guide from the site you like best. Doesn't seem like much effort to me.I wish Sony would do everyone a favor and do all their series like this, especially the ones that apparently aren't going to be finished (The Jeffersons, Maude, Different Strokes, etc, etc). Their costs would be lower and fans would get their shows in their ENTIRETY. Not just a few seasons and vanish when sales aren't what Sony would like.On a final note the picture quality and sound are just fine, especially if played on a blu ray player with good upconversion.

Not only do we get the entire library of shows that were produced, which were 133, but we as consumers get an excellent deal. Buying or bidding on the individual sets can be costly and frustrating, but this set comes to us at a great price.""Good Times"" was one of Norman Lear's favorite shows that he produced. Many critics called it ""one of the best sitcoms ever made"". Airing from February 8, 1974-August 1, 1979, ""Good Times"" originally aired on CBS when African-American comedies starting debuting on network TV. Shows like ""The Jeffersons"" and ""Sanford and Son"" were extremely popular, but ""Good Times"" was special because it was mainly about a family trying to make it in the world. It didn't matter that they had no money or didn't live in an elaborate apartment, the Evans had each other and that's all that mattered.The series was a spin-off of another Lear show called ""Maude"", which was a spin-off of ""All in The Family"". The cast was filled with amazing talent like Esther Rolle, John Amos (who is one of my favorite actors period), Janet DuBois, Jimmy Walker, and others, and the writing was top-notch. Even to this day the series is relevant, as in the  2000's there are many that can't afford to pay bills, and have a hard time making ends meet.The series became a top 10 hit in its second year on the air, and it eventually lost viewers because CBS kept changing the nights it aired the show. John Amos quit the series at the end of the 1975-1976 season because he wasn't happy with the scripts, and in the following year Esther Rolle left due to a salary dispute. Luckily she returned for the show's final year. Janet Jackson starred in ""Good Times"" last 2 seasons playing a child being battered by her mother. And fortunately, the series had a proper ending in August, 1979. I won't say how the series ended, but it ended on a high note.The episodes are restored in pristine condition. They come in a box where they are piled on top of one another, so be extremely careful with the dics when taking them out. I will not complain about the packaging, because lets face it, this is a wonderful deal on a wonderful TV show. Televison was so good back in the '70's. TV today is filled with so much reality crap that it's nice to have DVD's and watch classic and entertaining shows.
