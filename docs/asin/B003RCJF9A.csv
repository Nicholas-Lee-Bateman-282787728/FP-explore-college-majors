Eventually, the group figures out what they have in common and try to ban together to survive.  However, things don't always go as planned.It was an OK movie but could have been much better.  The pacing was very slow.  The slow pacing doesn't help when the storyline is so simplistic.  The viewer watches the same senerio over and over and over (one member turns savage then another then another) until the ending is reached.  Aside from slow pacing, not much information is given as to why the guy is holding the people captive.  Yes, he experienced trauma as a child and yes, the group does have one thing in common but why is he doing it (and he documents the results)?  Also, it is revealed that the group shares a common secret: however, there are two members of the group whose secret isn't revealed.

They are promised their freedom if they can last just over 30 days without food, but as hunger sets in, the captives find much more to fear in each other than in simple starvation! This nifty little premise allows director Steven Hentges to cram a great deal of suspense into his claustrophobic set, but HUNGER will leave most audiences wanting more. It is far too reflective of the SAW series with the sadistic overseer attempting to push his victims to inhuman lengths in order for them to discover their survivor's instinct. Even that would be forgivable were it not for the mundane cast. With the exception of Lori Heuring, we are left with a handful of whiny, depressing characters that do nothing to draw from our sympathies. Joe Egender is quickly pinned down as the villain, a role which suits him nicely. Lea Kohl and Julian Rojas, on the other hand, are just awful, and make for some unintentional humor with their ridiculous overacting. This takes away from the seriousness of their situation, as the final act unravels into a bloody mess.

Just a lot of mindless gore, sex and nudity, without much in the way of originality or intelligence.  I am, however, a big fan of horror movies with a psychological terror angle to them.  I decided to give this one a try since it seemed to get better than average reviews.  I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  The acting is surprisingly good, and the storyline is somewhat original and genuinely creepy.  Don't get me wrong, it's not Citizen Kane or anything, but it is a good, interesting story, portrayed by normal looking (not plastic, beautiful people who are usually cast in these things), better-than-average actors.  The guy who plays the villain is the same guy who seems to be in nearly every commercial lately, including the ""think with your dipstick Jimmy"" guy, which is a little distracting and makes it kind of hard to take him seriously.  Four stars feels a little high, but it's definitely better than average, which is what I consider three stars to be.

However, because the central conceit of the movie and the central conceit of my review revolve around the same thing, I'm sorry if this is a spoiler alert (though if you didn't understand where the movie was going by reading that, you probably shouldn't be watching it): Hunger is a movie about cannibalism. And, because of its ridiculous script, written by one L. D. Goffigan, who has no other credits on IMDB, it is a very bad movie about cannibalism.Plot: a nameless scientist/nutzoid, played as a child by  Britton Partain in his first screen appearance and as an adult by Beerfest's Bjorn Johnson, kidnaps five seemingly-random folks--Jordan (Wicked Little Things' Lori Heuring), Grant (Resident Evil: Extinction's Linden Ashby), Luke (The Hamiltons' Joe Egender), Anna (Lea Kohl in her first screen appearance), and Alex (The Novice's Julian Rojas)--and confines them in a small area. They have a number of fifty-five gallon drums of water in a small alcove, some drinking utensils, and a scalpel, and mounted on a post is a white wall clock that has been modified to count down from thirty days. After a long, confusing period where everyone is trying to figure out how they got there, etc., Jordan, who it turns out is a doctor, hypothesizes about the clock and gives us a long, talky description of what happens to a starving body. (This becomes important towards the end of the film, for reasons of ""I can no longer suspend this much disbelief, you morons."") At which point the action begins.Oh, wait. No it doesn't. The ""action"", what little there is to be found in this movie, doesn't begin until an hour into its hour-and-forty-minute run time. Which is not necessarily a bad thing; a variation on this setup was done, and done way better, in Nine Dead (cf. review 29Dec11 ish). But that movie had actual characters, an interesting mystery that took the entire movie to solve (this one got through the ""why are we all here?"" bit in about ten minutes), a sense of pace...you get the idea. Still, I saw the potential, and was ready to give it some points for that, until we got to said beginning of action, where Goffigan stumbled on the stupidest horror movie trope I have ever seen:note: the rest of this review is SPOILER ALERT territory, be warned and stop reading now if necessary.According to L. D. Goffigan, the very act of taking a single bite of human flesh is an instant, one-way, express ticket to insanity. I shouldn't even have to use the term ""ludicrous"" here. But by the end of this movie, I wanted to take Hentges (who, by the way, turns in his first directorial effort in fourteen years, and given this, it may well be fourteen more before his next one) and Goffigan and stick them in a plane crash in the middle of the Andes to see which one ate the other first.I'm sure this movie could have been worse--Lori Heuring, despite quite possibly the worst string of casting choices in history, is a capable actress, and the rest of the crowd do a passable job with a script that should have been burned, not filmed. And I'll give Britton Partain props for his very few scenes here, which are the best in the film.

1360841,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B003RCJF9A,The Piper at the Gates,"[0, 0]","I decided to give this one a chance after finding it on Netlflix. I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, and overall, I got pretty much what I expected. The concept is simple, yet had the potential to be very effective. Five strangers find themselves locked up down in a hole with no way of escaping. As the days go by without food, they must do what they must to survive. All while a watchful eye watches the whole thing unfold, like an experiment. True, it's not the most original idea. The Saw franchise, and I'm sure there are a few others, that have done similar films. But even so, it doesn't mean that this one couldn't be a good movie. For a B -Movie, it was pretty well made and good production. Though of course, the majority of the film happens all on one set. The overall acting was alright. It wasn't anything great, but definitely not the worst I've seen. But one problem was that there wasn't quite enough character development. I found myself not really caring for any of the characters simply because I didn't get to know any of them that well. Certain horror films, like slashers, character development can take a back seat because its not as important. But this is a different type of horror film which does require more dialogue and exposition. I've read a few reviews that claim this film to be a bit graphic, bloody, and violent. But for me, that's where the movie doesn't step up and deliver. They could have made this film much more gritty, graphic and violent. But maybe they didn't have the budget to do so. Whatever the case, I was disappointed that they didn't push the limit in this area. I think the biggest problem I had with the film though, was the realism. I'm not a doctor or expert in starvation, but these people looked way too healthy to be going on 20, 25, 30+ days without food. I really saw no noticeable weight loss from anyone. For the most part, the characters just looked too clean. Guys had barely in facial growth, which to me was an obvious oversight!  And the girls had healthy and clean looking hair. Again, I get that this is a lower budget type film. And I suppose it takes some good effects to show extreme weight loss and starvation. But rubbing some dirt in the hair or applying a fake beard can't be that hard to accomplish or cost too much. I also had a problem believing exactly how much energy one would have after 30+ days without food. Could you move around, climb, or even stand up? Maybe, maybe not. The ending of the film was sort of bland, and wasn't anything special. Overall, the film isn't bad, but I thought it could have been a lot better. An added touch of brutality and realism would have went a long way. I recommend it for a one time viewing, but not for purchase.",3,"2.5 Stars: A decent concept, but not very realistic",1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,2747,"['decided', 'give', 'one', 'chance', 'finding', 'Netlflix', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'great', 'deal', 'film', 'overall', 'got', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'expected', 'concept', 'simple', 'yet', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'very', 'effective', 'Five', 'strangers', 'find', 'locked', 'up', 'down', 'hole', 'way', 'escaping', 'days', 'go', 'food', 'must', 'do', 'what', 'must', 'survive', 'watchful', 'eye', 'whole', 'thing', 'unfold', 'experiment', 'True', 'not', 'most', 'original', 'idea', 'Saw', 'franchise', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'few', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'similar', 'films', 'even', 'so', ""n't"", 'mean', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'B', '-Movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'made', 'good', 'production', 'course', 'majority', 'film', 'one', 'set', 'overall', 'acting', 'was', 'alright', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'great', 'definitely', 'not', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'problem', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'enough', 'character', 'development', 'found', 'not', 'really', 'caring', 'characters', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'well', 'Certain', 'horror', 'films', 'slashers', 'character', 'development', 'can', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'not', 'important', 'different', 'type', 'horror', 'film', 'require', 'more', 'dialogue', 'exposition', ""'ve"", 'read', 'few', 'reviews', 'claim', 'film', 'be', 'bit', 'graphic', 'bloody', 'violent', 'where', 'movie', ""n't"", 'step', 'up', 'deliver', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'gritty', 'graphic', 'violent', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'budget', 'do', 'so', 'Whatever', 'case', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'push', 'limit', 'area', 'think', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'realism', ""'m"", 'not', 'doctor', 'expert', 'starvation', 'people', 'looked', 'way', 'too', 'healthy', 'be', 'going', '20', '25', '30+', 'days', 'food', 'really', 'saw', 'noticeable', 'weight', 'loss', 'anyone', 'most', 'part', 'characters', 'just', 'looked', 'too', 'clean', 'Guys', 'had', 'barely', 'facial', 'growth', 'was', 'obvious', 'oversight', 'girls', 'had', 'healthy', 'clean', 'looking', 'hair', 'Again', 'get', 'lower', 'budget', 'type', 'film', 'suppose', 'good', 'effects', 'show', 'extreme', 'weight', 'loss', 'starvation', 'rubbing', 'dirt', 'hair', 'applying', 'fake', 'beard', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'that', 'hard', 'accomplish', 'cost', 'too', 'much', 'also', 'had', 'problem', 'believing', 'exactly', 'how', 'much', 'energy', 'one', 'would', 'have', '30+', 'days', 'food', 'Could', 'move', 'around', 'climb', 'even', 'stand', 'up', 'Maybe', 'maybe', 'not', 'ending', 'film', 'was', 'sort', 'bland', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'Overall', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'added', 'touch', 'brutality', 'realism', 'would', 'have', 'went', 'long', 'way', 'recommend', 'one', 'time', 'viewing', 'not', 'purchase']",Hunger
1360842,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B003RCJF9A,Todd Smith,"[3, 4]","Fangoria Frightfest film number three is Hunger, which many people have compared to Saw. Yeah, this movie is Saw, if Saw had the people locked in an empty room, had no budget, and Jigsaw was a mute cannibal. Hunger is most defiantly a ten on the gross out scale, but besides that it has absolutely nothing going for it. Seldom have I seen a horror film that is as pointless or moves as slowly as Hunger did. The film is only one hundred minutes, but it felt as though I was watching it for days! The star of the film is veteran horror actress, Lori Huering, whose character is pretty well written, but is also unfortunately as dull as the rest of the cast. Most reviews for Hunger have been favorable and I can't understand that. Aside from the victims arguing with each other, there is hardly any dialogue. There is also zero character development, which is crucial in a film like this. If the audience doesn't give two s***s about the victims or what happens to them, then what's the point? Hunger tries to shock you with it's level of gore, but more concerning is the lack of substance and the laziness of the film makers. Yes, the ripped off most of their ideas from Saw. Saw had a tremendous villain and a fascinating story that spawned six squeals, while this film is so lazy that after a month of isolation, the men's beards didn't even grow!

All they know about it is that they do not know the place, that they have a few pieces of this and that, and that they have no idea how to get out. The people seem like a culture shock, too, and the things they have in common are odd. Added to that is the watching eye that keeps staring, hiding the reason these people are there and the inner reason why this needs to happen. As the people explore this place they see a more and more grim reality, too, and it leads them to think about acting on some terrible thoughts.When the Fangoria line-up hit, I didn't know what to expect. Some of the movie were not what I wanted to see, either, but a few were. The story of a hospital with children being haunted was good, and Dark House was a nice 80s vibe. Still, all the movies did not carry themselves this way. When I got to Hunger, however, things seemed a little different. The film seemed a little cheap at first, but this rush to judgment would have made me miss out some something. As the image on the front implies, things get messy here.As far as storyline, it is simple and complex at the same time. You have people that are caught and that are herded, and these people do not know why. The place is wired and the people do not seem to notice, but they quickly seem to figure something out. As the time elapses they grow more and more concerned with self, too, and the group idea seems endangered. Then, well, the stuff really gets out of hand.The actors did a nice job here as well and I was happy with that because some movie simply don't try. This one does, and it shows. you can feel the tunnels and you can taste the needs and, honestly, it makes the situation all-the-more interesting. As someone that wants blood and expected it, I felt like I got what I was asking for. It all came out in the proverbial wash.If you are looking to check out something nice, check this one out. It is one of the three best Fangoria movies this year, and I liked them all. This was a human horror that made it in the mix and, well, I thought it was nice.
