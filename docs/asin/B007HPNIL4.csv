1530937,A2DOH9J8JMTG7F,B007HPNIL4,"Matt D. ""matt""","[0, 0]","That would make an average of 4.5, but since I can't give that rating, I will give it the benefit of the doubt and give it a full 5.This is one of my favorite seasons of Amazing Race, and I was stoked when I found out it was getting a DVD release. Overall this may be one of the most fun casts that the show has ever had (even if it does have terrible Jonathan). It also features some of my favorite challenges and one of the most fun race routes.The set itself is a little disappointing for what it's worth. I'm glad that it comes in a regular-sized case to save shelf-space, but I'm a little disappointed that quality was sacrificed for having the season spread over a smaller number of discs. It's 13 episodes, 11 of which are 42 minutes and first and last episodes being 80 minutes each, on a mere three discs. Personally I would have been happier with four discs, with the extra space used to increase quality. The Survivor seasons are spread over five discs and have higher quality video/audio. I can't complain too much though, since just two years ago the possibility of this season getting any sort of home media release was practically nonexistent, so I'm thankful that it actually even got released.The chances of this season ever getting a mass-retail release are practically zero, so if you're a fan of the season, this is your best bet. The prices on these sets fluctuate all the time, so wait for a price on this that catches your eye and jump at the chance. If you are an Amazing Race fan and you missed this season, I would highly recommend it. If you love the season like me, this is a must buy.",5,"5 stars for the season, 4 stars for the set",1336521600,"05 9, 2012",2012,1613,"['would', 'make', 'average', '4.5', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'rating', 'will', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'give', 'full', '5.This', 'one', 'favorite', 'seasons', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'was', 'stoked', 'when', 'found', 'was', 'getting', 'DVD', 'release', 'Overall', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'casts', 'show', 'ever', 'had', 'even', 'have', 'terrible', 'Jonathan', 'also', 'favorite', 'challenges', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'race', 'routes.The', 'set', 'little', 'disappointing', 'what', 'worth', ""'m"", 'glad', 'regular-sized', 'case', 'save', 'shelf-space', ""'m"", 'little', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'was', 'sacrificed', 'having', 'season', 'spread', 'smaller', 'number', 'discs', '13', 'episodes', '11', 'are', '42', 'minutes', 'first', 'last', 'episodes', 'being', '80', 'minutes', 'mere', 'three', 'discs', 'Personally', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'happier', 'four', 'discs', 'extra', 'space', 'used', 'increase', 'quality', 'Survivor', 'seasons', 'are', 'spread', 'five', 'discs', 'have', 'higher', 'quality', 'video/audio', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'two', 'years', 'possibility', 'season', 'getting', 'sort', 'home', 'media', 'release', 'was', 'practically', 'nonexistent', ""'m"", 'thankful', 'actually', 'even', 'got', 'released.The', 'chances', 'season', 'ever', 'getting', 'mass-retail', 'release', 'are', 'practically', 'zero', 'so', ""'re"", 'fan', 'season', 'best', 'bet', 'prices', 'sets', 'fluctuate', 'time', 'so', 'wait', 'price', 'eye', 'jump', 'chance', 'are', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'fan', 'missed', 'season', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'love', 'season', 'must', 'buy']",The Amazing Race: Season 6

1530939,A24C3QECVZW512,B007HPNIL4,Sam H,"[7, 8]","For the first few episodes, I really didn't like TAR6 at all. It was by far my least favourite at the time and all the bickering couples (particularly from Jonathan) mixed with all the non-couples being elminated pretty quickly really wasn't doing it for me. However, around episode 4/5 I learnt to get over that and once you stop taking the season too seriously you really learn to enjoy it. As a matter of fact, most of the bickering had me in stitches towards the end and I ended up warming to a lot more of the endgame couples than I thought I would. So overall, it ended up leveling out for me as a top tier season and one I wouldn't pass up watching again. So glad to finally be having the first 7 seasons on DVD.
