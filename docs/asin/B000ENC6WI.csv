The movie never takes itself seriously and I just didnt like it any part of it. I didnt really laugh at any jokes, but im sure some people would. I dont know who would enjoy this film but someone out there has too.Ron Jeremy is better in Terror Firmer. If you want to see him at his comic best watch Toxie Avenger 4: Citzen Toxie.

The film does not take itself too seriously.The movie was very funny, and the plot kept me interested all the way through and I also enjoyed the narrator in the movie , who kind of reminded me of ""uncle jesse"" from dukes of hazzard.

974787,AB53UWILW4F8R,B000ENC6WI,J. Johnson,"[1, 1]","The DVD box cover is misleading and I thought I was picking up a serious indy horror film. I guess they did that to attract serious horror fans knowing that once they started watching this movie they couldn't stop. The dude that put together the box cover needs to be given a bonus. He moved at least one disc.This is a really well made Horror Comedy with quality actors and a great pace. I didn't even know that Ron Jeremy was in this film. If I would have known that I wouldn't have given it a chance and most likely, wouldn't have bought it. A ""Hollywood Video"" store in Cookeville, Tennessee had a going out of business sale and DVDs were ten for $15 so I took a quick look at it and grabbed it just so I could have ten-movies.Jeremy actually does a pretty good job as ""Andre the Butcher"" and he plays a non-speaking character. Jeremy should play more of those.This movie is a must see for any current or former cheerleader. It's the young folks car breaks down horror storyline with a humorous twist. Four junior college kids, three-girls and a guy, all cheerleaders going to a cheerleading competition. Two really good looking cheerleaders and one fat cheerleader who really likes to eat! She's not really fat by normal person standards but anything over 110 lbs is fat to a cheerleader. In one scene, Andre the Butcher baits her by hanging a donut on a string in a tree!Despite Ron Jeremy being in this movie there is no graphic sex and only a couple of flashes of nudity and that was done by a ""boob double"". If you watch this movie once you might think that it was ""sexually charged"" but in reality there is almost no nudity. Kind of like a lot of people think ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" was a bloody movie. It wasn't.You can really get into the characters in this movie. Cheerleaders are in full uniform for the entire movie. A ""Dukes of Hazzard"" Uncle Jesse narrator look-a-like is used, but not overused, to add some great humor.

Obviously, I knew this movie was going to be horrible, but I think it was one of those B rated movies where the plot was suppose to be funny.

974789,A3S2O5DD12JW8X,B000ENC6WI,Kevin Race,"[0, 0]","I've discovered over time that anything Ron Jeremy is involved with, though it may not be life changing or intended to be thought provoking, really does have a certain coolness factor that can't be ignored. This film is a lot of fun and is very tongue-in-cheek in the way it portrays the low-budget horror genre. The ""rough around the edges"" look and feel of the film gives it a certain charm that most high-budget ""studio"" films can't pull off.Besides Ron Jeremy the cast also includes Maury Sterling, who has quite an impressive list of credits on IMDB ranging from television shows such as Angel, CSI, Nip/Tuck, Charmed, Monk, ER and 24, to films such as Smokin' Aces and Beverly Hills Chihuahua.Also starring as the lead in the film is newcomer April Billingsley. This talented newcomer has some excellent acting chops and judging by her reels and blogs easily found on YouTube it is apparent that she'll have quite an impressive list of credits in her repertoire soon as well. Check out her website at aprilbillingsley.com and see for yourself what she has to offer.Overall, if you're not looking for a state-of-the-art, edge-of-your-seat type of horror film and are instead more interested in a campy, Troma influenced, fun popcorn movie you really can't go wrong with this one.
