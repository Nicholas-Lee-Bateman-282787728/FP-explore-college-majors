The title makes it sound &quot;fluffy&quot; but there's a lot of punch in the story.It's about 3 strong-willed women as they live their lives and interact with each other and the world around them. The grandmother, Charlie Kate (Gena Rowlands) is the pivot of the story. She's tough but not uncaring. She knows who she is and what she wants from life. Her daughter, Sophia (Mimi Rogers), is also strong but in a different way. Margaret (Susan May Pratt) is the granddaughter, who blends the best of her grandmother and mother.There's a lot of humor in the film and a fair amount of pathos as well but it's neither a comedy nor depressing. There is a lot to admire in all 3 women and how they respond to each other and live their lives.",5,Fascinating character study.,1081468800,"04 9, 2004",2004,776,"['film', 'surprised', 'lot', 'ways', 'title', 'sound', 'quot', 'quot', 'lot', 'punch', 'story.It', '3', 'strong-willed', 'women', 'live', 'lives', 'interact', 'other', 'world', 'grandmother', 'Charlie', 'Kate', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'pivot', 'story', 'tough', 'not', 'uncaring', 'who', 'what', 'life', 'daughter', 'Sophia', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'also', 'strong', 'different', 'way', 'Margaret', 'Susan', 'May', 'Pratt', 'granddaughter', 'who', 'best', 'grandmother', 'mother.There', 'lot', 'humor', 'film', 'fair', 'amount', 'pathos', 'well', 'comedy', 'depressing', 'lot', 'admire', '3', 'women', 'how', 'respond', 'other', 'live', 'lives']",N/A

It is in parts humurous, romantic, dramatic and sad.  If you loved ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" as I did, you will enjoy this tale of Southern women from the WWII era.  This is a movie that the entire family can enjoy as there was no cursing or sex.The relationship between the three generation of women was portrayed with great honesty and affection.  And although some of the men were portrayed as nitwits, in the end, it showcased two beautiful love stories.The actress who portrayed ""Margaret"" has a gorgeous smile.

All of the actors in this film were quite good, believable and worked well as an ensemble. However, the main reason for my purchasing this movie, ""Charms  for the Easy Life"", was because of Gena Rowlands. She always maintains a dignity and purposeful quiet presence, that you know will eventually burst open when all logic has been exhausted. Some scenes are slightly predictable, but the acting and story line more than make up for that. Very good film.",5,"Gena Rowlands, what a treasure",1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,605,"['Sorry', 'say', ""'m"", 'running', 'steam', 'commenting', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'lately', 'would', 'carry', 'longer', 'viewer', 'might', 'want', 'read', 'actors', 'film', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'believable', 'worked', 'well', 'ensemble', 'However', 'main', 'reason', 'purchasing', 'movie', 'Charms', 'Easy', 'Life', 'was', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'always', 'dignity', 'purposeful', 'quiet', 'presence', 'know', 'will', 'eventually', 'burst', 'open', 'when', 'logic', 'been', 'exhausted', 'scenes', 'are', 'slightly', 'predictable', 'acting', 'story', 'line', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'Very', 'good', 'film']",N/A

772895,ASJ89T42CIUHU,B0000C2IR0,V. Marshall,"[15, 15]","If you love films about strong women and what they can accomplish throughout the generations this flick is for you.The great Gena Rowlands stars as a homeopathic healer whose strength and spirit runs her town and family ragged. She compassionately treats a town of people with herbs and treatments made from love while watching over her daughter and granddaughter like a hawk. The daughter is played by Mimi Rogers, her character is a flirty frilly woman always in search of love and not very interested in medicine. The granddaughter is played very well by Susan May Pratt and she is the family member who ends up following in her grandmother's footsteps. The relationship between the grandmother and granddaughter is truly touching and inspirational. The strength of all of the women is to be admired especially because the film takes place during the 40's and WWII when women were still expected to be mothers, housekeepers and cooks rather than professional independent women on their own.Rowlands steals this film away and will leave you wishing for a grandmother just like her. The beauty of this movie lies in the compassion and relationships in a family of women. I believe it will charm you into a new way of living.",4,Charming!,1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,1225,"['love', 'films', 'strong', 'women', 'what', 'can', 'accomplish', 'generations', 'flick', 'you.The', 'great', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'homeopathic', 'healer', 'strength', 'spirit', 'town', 'family', 'ragged', 'compassionately', 'town', 'people', 'herbs', 'treatments', 'made', 'love', 'watching', 'daughter', 'granddaughter', 'hawk', 'daughter', 'played', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'character', 'flirty', 'frilly', 'woman', 'always', 'search', 'love', 'not', 'very', 'interested', 'medicine', 'granddaughter', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Susan', 'May', 'Pratt', 'family', 'member', 'who', 'up', 'following', 'grandmother', 'footsteps', 'relationship', 'grandmother', 'granddaughter', 'truly', 'touching', 'inspirational', 'strength', 'women', 'be', 'admired', 'especially', 'film', 'place', '40', 'WWII', 'when', 'women', 'were', 'still', 'expected', 'be', 'mothers', 'housekeepers', 'rather', 'professional', 'independent', 'women', 'own.Rowlands', 'steals', 'film', 'away', 'will', 'leave', 'wishing', 'grandmother', 'just', 'beauty', 'movie', 'compassion', 'relationships', 'family', 'women', 'believe', 'will', 'charm', 'new', 'way', 'living']",N/A
