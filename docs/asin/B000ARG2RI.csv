931939,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000ARG2RI,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[0, 0]","IIf you have never seen Butan, or any films done in Butan, this film provides a remarkable and impressive landscape of Butan, which is located in South Asia at the end of the Himalayas.The film is with a few stories, and storytellers.  It begins with a villager, who is also a government official named Dondup.  He is  bored, and  determined to leave his countryside for the United States.  On his journey to the U.S., he misses the bus and hitchhikes down the beautiful lush mountainous road.....a long journey.  He encounters quite an array of characters and must travel with them, a monk, an apple seller, and an old man with a beautiful young daughter, to whom Dondup is attracted.And here, the storytelling begins, and the focus of the film changes to reveal the story of another young man whose attraction for a beautiful married woman leads to lust, murder,  jealousy.  Here, a young man falls for the old man's young wife, who seems unattached emotionally.  The story is dramatic and intense.  It is a mystical fable to learn from.What makes this a wonderful film is the weaving of the stories and the focus of the film, the ride they villagers take.  It may seem confusing at times, but see if twice if needed.  It is a good, clean film, with breathtaking mountainous views of Butan.We don't have a lot of foreign films from Bhutan, and this is supposedly Butan's first full length film, and as with many foreign film, there were no professional actors.The pace is slower, but it is well worth it.  There is much to be seen, a lot to be heard.  Enjoy, Rizzo",5,A story within a story!

Erland,"[69, 70]","Note: Dzonghka with English subtitles.Expertly written and directed by Khyentse Norbu, 'Traveller & Magicians' is an enchanting tale of self-discovery and the realization that ones' hopes and dreams are not always as far off as one might think.Dondup (Tsewang Dandup) hates the life he leads in a remote Himalayan village. Even though he holds an important position he dreams of a life in America with a high paying job and an attractive, sexy wife. He constantly reminds his friends that there are no pretty girls in their small community.He finally receives a letter from a close friend already in America who has arrainged Dondup's passage to the U.S.A. The only problem is he has only two days to get to the point of departure. Not an easy task considering the isolated, mountainous region of his village and the lack of modern transportation. He is forced to hitchhike the distance.On the way Dondup is joined by a monk (Sonam Kinga), a drunk, an old man on his way to market to sell apples and another elderly man from Dondup's village traveling with his young and beautiful daughter Sonam (Sonam Lhamo) who has just returned from school to help her recently widowed Father with his rice paper business.During the two day journey the intuitive monk discerns the inner turmoil within Dondup and his growing affection for Sonam. He cleverly weaves a wonderful tale about an imaginary young man named Tashi (Lhakpa Dorji) and his love affair with the lovely and married Deki (Deki Yangzom) in an effort to help the confused fellow traveller decide what path in life is right for him. By the end of the journey Dondrup has come to realize the truth of the monks statement, ""What we hoped for yesterday, we dread today.""This is storytelling at its finest against the backdrop of the enchanting Bhutan countryside. A bittersweet look at life in transition.

931941,A1K9KNLTSJF7Q9,B000ARG2RI,Daiho,"[7, 7]","It's obvious that director/writer Khyentse Norbu had a statement to make - about his country Bhutan, about the Bhutanese film industry, and about finding happiness right where you are.  Unfortunately, he can't deliver on all counts.From the opening scenes the film is testament to the beauty of the Himalayan mini-state of Bhutan.  Any film maker watching this movie must be running through his head all manner of scenarios to exploit the country's natural beauty.  That Travelers and Magicians was made with local crew and cast speaks admirably to the abilities of the Bhutanese to create world-class film.But the script reveals that Khyentse Norbu, while perhaps a great scholar of Buddhism, is not always a great writer of stories.  His debut film, The Cup, was a charming tale built on an ensemble cast of mostly children, a simple story about monks infatuated with soccer who go to comedic lengths to watch live broadcasts of the World Cup.Travelers and Magicians is a bit more complex.  It's a story within a story, requiring the director to not only deliver on two fronts but to seamlessly weave from the two a unified whole.  The film begins in modern Bhutan with Dondup, a young man infatuated with the USA and eager to escape the simple rural life of Bhutan.  On the road to the capital of Thimphu, he meets up with a monk, who in Dondup is reminded of Tashi, a young lad restless for adventure.  To while away the long hours of travel, the monk begins his story of long, long ago and throughout the film we cut back and forth between Dondup and the monk, and the tale of Tashi.The fable is for all its soft tones, titled camera angles, and vivid colors, the more realistic of the two stories.  We see how Tashi and his supporting cast develop over the course of the story, how they change through their interactions with each other..  The same can't be said for the characters in the framing story, who come off as devices, stereotypical, one dimensional stand-ups - the disillusioned youth seeking escape, the wise monk who reminds him of the verities of life, the innocent girl whose charm and beauty softens the hero's heart,  and the country bumpkins who tag along for comic relief.  By the end of the film, we hardly know them at all.  While Dondup comes to realize that happiness is not something to seek from without but from within, it's a last minute conversion that leaves a hollow, empty feeling.Travelers and Magicians is an obvious labor of love from cast and crew and where effort and earnestness are concerned there is no doubt the film is deserving of the highest honors.  If only the magicians had spun a spell over the script, it would be perfect.#",3,Beautiful film that never quite realizes its ambitions,1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,2677,"['obvious', 'director/writer', 'Khyentse', 'Norbu', 'had', 'statement', 'make', 'country', 'Bhutan', 'Bhutanese', 'film', 'industry', 'finding', 'happiness', 'right', 'where', 'are', 'Unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'counts.From', 'opening', 'film', 'testament', 'beauty', 'Himalayan', 'mini-state', 'Bhutan', 'Any', 'film', 'maker', 'watching', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'running', 'head', 'manner', 'scenarios', 'exploit', 'country', 'natural', 'beauty', 'Travelers', 'Magicians', 'was', 'made', 'local', 'crew', 'cast', 'speaks', 'admirably', 'abilities', 'Bhutanese', 'create', 'world-class', 'script', 'Khyentse', 'Norbu', 'perhaps', 'great', 'scholar', 'Buddhism', 'not', 'always', 'great', 'writer', 'stories', 'debut', 'film', 'Cup', 'was', 'charming', 'tale', 'built', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'mostly', 'children', 'simple', 'story', 'monks', 'infatuated', 'soccer', 'who', 'go', 'comedic', 'lengths', 'watch', 'live', 'broadcasts', 'World', 'Cup.Travelers', 'Magicians', 'bit', 'more', 'complex', 'story', 'story', 'requiring', 'director', 'not', 'only', 'deliver', 'two', 'fronts', 'seamlessly', 'weave', 'two', 'unified', 'whole', 'film', 'modern', 'Bhutan', 'Dondup', 'young', 'man', 'infatuated', 'USA', 'eager', 'escape', 'simple', 'rural', 'life', 'Bhutan', 'road', 'capital', 'Thimphu', 'up', 'monk', 'who', 'Dondup', 'reminded', 'Tashi', 'young', 'lad', 'restless', 'adventure', 'away', 'long', 'hours', 'travel', 'monk', 'story', 'long', 'long', 'ago', 'film', 'cut', 'back', 'forth', 'Dondup', 'monk', 'tale', 'Tashi.The', 'fable', 'soft', 'tones', 'titled', 'camera', 'angles', 'vivid', 'colors', 'more', 'realistic', 'two', 'stories', 'see', 'how', 'Tashi', 'supporting', 'cast', 'develop', 'course', 'story', 'how', 'change', 'interactions', 'other..', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'characters', 'framing', 'story', 'who', 'come', 'off', 'devices', 'stereotypical', 'one', 'dimensional', 'stand-ups', 'disillusioned', 'youth', 'seeking', 'escape', 'wise', 'monk', 'who', 'verities', 'life', 'innocent', 'girl', 'charm', 'beauty', 'hero', 'heart', 'country', 'bumpkins', 'who', 'tag', 'comic', 'relief', 'end', 'film', 'hardly', 'know', 'Dondup', 'realize', 'happiness', 'not', 'something', 'seek', 'last', 'minute', 'conversion', 'hollow', 'empty', 'feeling.Travelers', 'Magicians', 'obvious', 'labor', 'love', 'cast', 'crew', 'where', 'effort', 'earnestness', 'are', 'concerned', 'doubt', 'film', 'deserving', 'highest', 'honors', 'only', 'magicians', 'had', 'spun', 'spell', 'script', 'would', 'be', 'perfect.']",N/A

Pawl ""Dani""","[25, 26]","I reccomend that everyone see this, if not for the fact that it is a beautifully told story, but that, I believe, this is one of the few (if not the only) Bhutanese film released in the United States.""Travellers & Magicians"" doesn't rely on loud, boisterous special effects, airbrushed superstars or computer-generated chase sequences.  What it does rely on is a believable plot line, an exasperated lead character, Dondup (Tshewang Dendup), who wants nothing more but to leave his tired Bhutanese village, go into the big city, and, ultimately leave for the United States.  Dondup is dissatisfied with his government job, the fact that there are few (if any) cute girls for him to acquaint himself with, no movie theatres or restaurants.  This is a universal plight that anyone from a small town (or village) can relate to, be they in Bhutan or in a small town in the flatlands of the United States.  As he attempts to leave, during one of the village festivals, he encounters a monk, a fruit vendor, an elderly man and his daughter.  They are all trying to hitch a ride, for various reasons.  Although, the self-absorbed Dondup is, at first, rather annoyed at his unsolicited companions, he eventually becomes drawn into the monk's storytelling.  In fact, he is so compelled to hear the conclusion of the story (parallel to his plight), that he allows the fruit vendor to leave on the next tour bus out, just to stay behind and listen to the conclusion.This film examines ""the grass is greener"" view that we all share, regardless of culture.  Is it really the environment with which we surround ourselves (the outer), or our own general outlook on life (the inner), that determines our ultimate satisfaction with life?

931948,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,B000ARG2RI,Scrimshaw,"[0, 1]","Travellers and Magicians is a 2003 Bhutanese Drama Film written and directed by Khyentse Norbu, who is a reincarnate lama of Tibetan Buddhism (whatever that is), and you could tell while watching this film, that it was clearly influenced by Tibetan Buddhism, especially during the scenes involving the Buddhist Monk and his story. The main story focuses on a government official named Dondup who is living in a beautiful village in the mountains of Bhutan and is obsessed with traveling to America to make a living, perhaps as an apple picker, and find excitement and adventure, which he feels he cannot find in the isolated village he's currently in, which has no restaurants or movie theaters. One thing I noticed while watching the film was how warm and hospitable the people were compared with many people in the West, especially the United States, and how patient and less aggressive they seemed. In addition to that, I also noticed how unspoiled and pristine the environment, the forests, rivers, mountains, of Bhutan are compared to many places in America. I mean here in America we do have large forests but they are mostly in national parks and outside of these parks you get alot of noise and congestion, even in small towns, with the possible exception of some places in New England and maybe the South, but in any case, Bhutan still feels much more primitive and old-fashioned than America. Most of the buildings were made of wood or stone and it was much quieter and laid-back compared to the states. But back to the movie, Dondup is so eager to leave, that he doesn't seem to notice or even care, about the beautiful land and wonderful people he's leaving behind. There are several scenes where's he's listening to American music on a radio and dancing to it, while wearing his denim gho and sneakers. He misses the first bus to Thimphu, where he's originally headed, so he waits at a bus stop, which looks more like a clearing by the side of the road, than a bus stop you would find in the west. He is quickly joined by an old man who's an apple seller, and later by a friendly, talkative Buddhist monk, who, after discovering how badly Dondup wants to leave for America, or a Dreamland, as he mysteriously calls it, the monk relates a similar story or parable that took place in earlier times and focused on a man much like him named Tashi, who was living in a village where he was apparently studying to become a magician, despite not believing in magic. He is eager to leave the village and eventually travels into the mountains to an isolated house where he meets an old man living with his much younger wife, who he falls in love with and gets pregnant. The woman fears the man will kill her and him if he finds out about the pregnancy, so they concoct a poison to kill him, which they give to him during what I'm assuming is dinner, and you never really find out if he dies or not, but regardless, Tashi loses in the end anyway because the woman is drowned in the river under mysterious circumstances. Afterwards, Tashi is seen back in the field with his younger brother, crying and looking into a glass of water at what appears to be a reflection of the woman he fell in love with. His brother tells him he got drunk and the horse that he seemingly rode into the mountains earlier is gone, replaced by a donkey, and it appears to be just a hallucination or perhaps a dream. Interspersed with this story by the monk are scenes where the three men are traveling on the mountain road from place to place, over several days, waiting for a bus or car to pick them up. They also seem to form a close bond, and at one point are traveling in a car with a funny drunk man, which picks up an old man and teenage girl who appears to like Dondup. The group forms a close bond as the monk continues with his story. Dondup himself is a very sympathetic character, as he appears to be very naive and ignorant to many of the realities of American life, at one point, despite being given an opportunity to get a ride to Thimphu he instead lets the old apple seller go, fearing the apples will rot if left exposed to the air much longer. In the end he manages to hitch a ride along with the monk to Thimphu, and happily waves at the teenage girl who looks back at him with a joyful expression. In the end, you never find out if he decides to go to America or not, although he seems to have had a change of heart based on his experiences over the last few days. Personally, I didn't mind that you never find out whether he leaves to America or not, I liked the open ended plot which leaves it to the viewer to decide whether he decides to go or not. Why? Well I think it's because it doesn't matter as much as the fact that he wants to leave Bhutan so badly, and the changes Bhutan has experienced as a result of opening up to the world and allowing TV and the Internet. That in the end, if the more important theme of this film. I liked all of the characters, the acting was good, and despite being a dramatic film, I found myself laughing at certain scenes, especially involving the monk and the drunk guy in the back of the car. However this film is definitely for the more patient viewer, as it moves at a slow pace and has little or no action. I wish there were more films like this, a well-deserved 5 stars.",5,Wonderful Bhutanese Parable,1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,5316,"['Travellers', 'Magicians', '2003', 'Bhutanese', 'Drama', 'Film',

It is a small country between India and China that has regulated foreign influence to maintain its traditional Buddhist culture.It was beautiful to see the interations between people as this simple story unfolded.  I enjoyed the glimpses of traditional culture and the way of life.  Most of the tale takes place along a road in the Himalayas where people who have a vehicle stop give people along the road a ride.It was a refreshing visit to a gentle, magical realm.

931950,A36DSZZST9T1RQ,B000ARG2RI,"Spyral ""Its All Just A Ride""","[1, 1]","""Travelers and Magicians"" is agreat film set in Bhutan, with the cast and creators being native Bhutanese. It is rare for films about the Himalayan region that come out in the Western world to have this kind of authenticity behind them. Films like Kundun and Seven Years in Tibet, while possessing fine cinematography and stories in their own right, are ultimately the vision of an outsider looking in, creating their own interpretation of life there.Not only is the film great in it's own right, but it is probably one of the best to come out of the region. It is partly a ""feel-good"" film, and partly a lesson in perspective. This is only fitting, since Bhutan, as a country, prides itself on balancing the need to move forward into a more modern world, but without giving up its distinct culture and way of life.Though the film moves at a slower pace, I didn't get too bored with it, or feel that it was stretching itself too long. The tale that provides the secondary narrative of the film, while a bit predictable, was important to the motivation of the primary narrative, and made you want to keep watching, if only just to see it all fleshed out, and come to fruition.If you like this film check out ""The Cup"" and ""Samsara"".",4,Great film,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,1231,"['Travelers', 'Magicians', 'agreat', 'film', 'set', 'Bhutan', 'cast', 'creators', 'being', 'native', 'Bhutanese', 'rare', 'films', 'Himalayan', 'region', 'out', 'Western', 'world', 'have', 'kind', 'authenticity', 'Films', 'Kundun', 'Seven', 'Years', 'Tibet', 'possessing', 'fine', 'cinematography', 'stories', 'own', 'right', 'are', 'ultimately', 'vision', 'outsider', 'looking', 'creating', 'own', 'interpretation', 'life', 'there.Not', 'only', 'film', 'great', 'own', 'right', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'come', 'region', 'partly', 'feel-good', 'film', 'partly', 'lesson', 'perspective', 'only', 'fitting', 'Bhutan', 'country', 'balancing', 'need', 'move', 'forward', 'more', 'modern', 'world', 'giving', 'up', 'distinct', 'culture', 'way', 'film', 'moves', 'slower', 'pace', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'bored', 'feel', 'was', 'stretching', 'too', 'long', 'tale', 'secondary', 'narrative', 'film', 'bit', 'predictable', 'was', 'important', 'motivation', 'primary', 'narrative', 'made', 'want', 'keep', 'watching', 'only', 'just', 'see', 'fleshed', 'out', 'come', 'fruition.If', 'film', 'check', 'Cup', 'Samsara']",N/A

Anyway Bhutan is a lovely, small country close to Nepal nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas. At times I think living in the Himalayas is really a state of mind - after all - the mountains in Colorado are much the same with their winding steams and beauty. The story is really two stories - a new government officer decides he wants to move to America the land of opportunity. He meets a Buddhist monk, an apple seller, a drunk, a lovely young woman, and her father - a paper seller on the way. The monk tells the second story which sheds light on the meaning of the primary story. The film is fairly slow paced - but insights, scenery and beautiful faces make up for the pace. The story is left kind of hanging in the air which is a little frustrating, but I guess you can choose the ending you like.
