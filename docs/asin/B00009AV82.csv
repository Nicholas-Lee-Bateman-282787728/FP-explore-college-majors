All I can say about this movie is, it's not worth the paper it's printed on. The cover art is the only good thing about this movie.I am the type of person that likes to give a movie a chance, but if it doesn't build after at least 20 mins, I can't fight off the temptation to turn it off. The only movies I have done this to from recent memory were This movie (Midnight Mass), Mona Lisa Smile and Closer with Julia Roberts.This movie had NOT ONE interesting scene in it. After about 20 mins, you're confused and bored senseless. I turned it off around that point, and have never watched it the whole way through, and I recommend that none of your waste 2 hours of your life on this piece of junk either.This movie really makes me feel good about myself though. I thought quite a few times of being a filmmaker, and after seeing this I thought to myself my WORST script I could ever write would be better than this one. So I'd hate to see how much better my BEST script could be.I think the person that wrote this movie thought to themself ""WHAT ARE THE MOST BORING KINDS OF SCENES IN MOVIES?"" and he compiled all of those thoughts into one movie. I don't wanna give this movie a bad rating because I try to tolerate even the low budget movies, but this one just plain out sucks!so don't waste your time, or money on this because you'll never get those 2 hours, or whatever amount of money you paid back.",1,BLUGH!,1118016000,"06 6, 2005",2005,1517,"['girlfriend', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'drawn', 'cover', 'artwork', 'movie', 'drew', 'line', 'sinker', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'not', 'worth', 'paper', 'printed', 'cover', 'art', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie.I', 'am', 'type', 'person', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', ""n't"", 'build', 'least', '20', 'mins', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fight', 'off', 'temptation', 'turn', 'off', 'only', 'movies', 'have', 'done', 'recent', 'memory', 'were', 'movie', 'Midnight', 'Mass', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'Closer', 'Julia', 'Roberts.This', 'movie', 'had', 'NOT', 'ONE', 'interesting', 'scene', '20', 'mins', ""'re"", 'confused', 'bored', 'senseless', 'turned', 'off', 'point', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'whole', 'way', 'recommend', 'none', 'waste', '2', 'hours', 'life', 'piece', 'junk', 'either.This', 'movie', 'really', 'feel', 'good', 'thought', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'being', 'filmmaker', 'seeing', 'thought', 'myself', 'WORST', 'script', 'could', 'ever', 'write', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'one', ""'d"", 'hate', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'BEST', 'script', 'could', 'be.I', 'think', 'person', 'wrote', 'movie', 'thought', 'themself', 'WHAT', 'ARE', 'THE', 'MOST', 'BORING', 'KINDS', 'OF', 'SCENES', 'IN', 'MOVIES', 'compiled', 'thoughts', 'one', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'give', 'movie', 'bad', 'rating', 'try', 'tolerate', 'even', 'low', 'budget', 'movies', 'one', 'just', 'plain', 'out', 'sucks', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'money', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', '2', 'hours', 'amount', 'money', 'paid', 'back']",Midnight Mass

Some people are giving this movie good reviews; some say there is some good acting; another person loved the make-up - we must be watching different versions of this movie....ACTING:  There are no actors.  Just local kids/friends/relatives who were asked &quot;Do you want a part in my movie?  We're going to film it all this weekend.&quot;  NO ONE can act.SPECIAL EFFECTS:  A few bright flashes of light - likely a deer jacking night light from some guys truck.MAKE-UP:  You could do better with a &quot;Hugo, Man of a THousand Faces&quot; puppet.PLOT:  OK - I'll give them some credit here.  An initially good idea that vampires now outnumber humans.  Has potential.  There are a few sparkles such as humans who help the vampires being called Vichy.  Also an interesting scene were a little girl acts like a lure for humans in order to see her mother again.  But nothing makes up for the dumb, dumb situations that develop.  For example, vampires control the night, so a young girl is getting a tatto over at the local peddlers' place.  It's now night.  There's a bang on the door.  &quot;Oh that must be my Dad come to walk me home.&quot; So she opens the door and voila - mindless vampires.  Wouldn't someone have thought to put a viewing port in the door?  If the night is so dangerous then why are you getting a tattoe in the first place?CHARACTERS:  Who?  For all the talk - do we really care if any of them survive?So just a bad movie.  Run away for it.  Wait for it to come to the $4.99 bin at Walmart.

I picked this book up after all the Twilight stuff was making look to a real vampire book. This book was up there with the classic Salem's Lot by Stephen King {when he could still write a book well}. Even with the terrible reviews I had to see the movie to see how it worked with the book. IT WAS TERRIBLE!!! I know you lose alot from book to film, but this was horrible. The acting was so BAD! I think they did go to a high school {and not a high school acting class either} and just ask poeple if they had a few hours. The neice to the priest I think was the worst. OK besides the bad acting, terrible camera work, and special effects there was the story. They took out not one but two main characters. The sister {nun} was the best character in the book and they deleted her. As far as the vampires the whole higharchy was deleted too. This was truly the worst film to book transfer in history.

753379,AW5LNZBFQAOWM,B00009AV82,"Noir Man ""Foggy Dude""","[1, 2]","I wouldn't have written a review for this flick, but I just saw it and found it a bit intriguing....the graphic on the dvd case suggested that the movie would be intense and very dark, but the power of good ended up putting in its own strong showing as well.  Of course, the story was about vampires taking over the world, but the good Catholic priest could not be counted out, either.I've seen so many low-budget horror films because I keep looking for pleasant surprises, so to speak, whether it's the story, the make-up, style and look of the film, or even the strength of the acting.  Well, the acting was pretty lame in this movie, except maybe for the priest, and that took away from the potential of a strong story, but the plot itself was fine, and the actual overt expression of good shown, i.e. the Catholics cleaning up their church (that was taken over by vampires to conduct Black Masses), conducting their own mass, fighting evil, as well as the priest's blessing those that had been killed by vampires...well, it was quite a surprising display of goodness.  I mean, I wasn't expecting that strong of a showing of Christian sentiment after looking at that dvd cover!  Actually, the movie displayed a clear sympathy towards the Catholics backed up by its rather hopeful, melancholic score (it reminded me of a score right out of a Spike Lee film, like ""He Got Game"" or maybe ""Do the Right Thing"").Aside from the acting being a real drawback in the film, I actually found myself still staying awake because of its stylistic elements and ironic displays of goodness as well as your standards displays of evil, too.",3,Catholic Storytelling Mixed with Blood and Vamps and Stuff,1240617600,"04 25, 2009",2009,1625,"['would', ""n't"", 'have', 'written', 'review', 'flick', 'just', 'saw', 'found', 'bit', 'intriguing', '.the', 'graphic', 'dvd', 'case', 'suggested', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'intense', 'very', 'dark', 'power', 'good', 'ended', 'up', 'putting', 'own', 'strong', 'showing', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'story', 'was', 'vampires', 'taking', 'world', 'good', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'counted', 'out', 'either.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'films', 'keep', 'looking', 'pleasant', 'surprises', 'so', 'speak', 'story', 'make-up', 'style', 'look', 'film', 'even', 'strength', 'acting', 'Well', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'lame', 'movie', 'maybe', 'priest', 'took', 'away', 'potential', 'strong', 'story', 'plot', 'was', 'fine', 'actual', 'overt', 'expression', 'good', 'shown', 'i.e', 'Catholics', 'cleaning', 'up', 'church', 'was', 'taken', 'over', 'vampires', 'conduct', 'Black', 'Masses', 'conducting', 'own', 'mass', 'fighting', 'evil', 'as', 'well', 'priest', 'blessing', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'vampires', 'well', 'was', 'quite', 'surprising', 'display', 'goodness', 'mean', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'strong', 'showing', 'Christian', 'sentiment', 'looking', 'dvd', 'cover', 'Actually', 'movie', 'displayed', 'clear', 'sympathy', 'Catholics', 'backed', 'up', 'rather', 'hopeful', 'melancholic', 'score', 'reminded', 'score', 'right', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'film', 'Got', 'Game', 'maybe', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', '.Aside', 'acting', 'being', 'real', 'drawback', 'film', 'actually', 'found', 'still', 'staying', 'awake', 'stylistic', 'elements', 'ironic', 'displays', 'goodness', 'as', 'well', 'standards', 'displays', 'evil', 'too']",Midnight Mass
753380,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00009AV82,Robert I. Hedges,"[1, 1]","Bad vampire movie? You're swimming in it. ""Midnight Mass"" is one of the worst horror films I have ever seen. The premise about vampires parasitically taking over the world isn't especially novel, but could have been a lot worse. Where the film falls down entirely is in the execution: it's simply ghastly (and not in a good way.) The film opens with a story about a virus spreading over the earth and wiping out humanity. As clumsy is that is, it turns out the virus angle is a giant multi-national governmental cover-up for the real problem, which is rampant vampirism.After the incredibly cheesy faux-newscast footage providing the backstory, the film cuts to four Goths on a road trip in an ancient Cadillac Seville searching for prey in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The film is nearly unbearable from the very beginning, mixing tedious dialogue, a ponderous plot, and dreadful overacting into a cauldron of sulfurous stink. The wholly unlikeable heroine, self-proclaimed atheist anarchist Gwen (Pamela Karp) sees an abduction by the Goths, and decides to do something about it. Her mission involves riding a bicycle hither and yon and bringing a disgraced Catholic priest, ""Father Joe"" (Douglas Gibson,) into the plot. The screenwriting is particularly tiresome, the plot is frequently needlessly convoluted, and the acting is constantly of the hysterically overwrought school of drama. Unfortunately one of the worst offenders is Gwen herself, and I was constantly hoping her demise would be premature and violent. (I only got one of my wishes.) Joe has a checkered past with some kind of scandal alluded to that is never especially clear or necessary to the plot. One thing's for sure: Gibson is one of the least convincing priests in screen history (though he does drink to excess.)Where does this all lead? To a huge clot of time-wasting padding in an underground tattoo parlor, some vampire fisticuffs, and an annoyingly long analogy of Nazi Germany to the vampire menace. In one (perhaps I should say ""the one"") clever piece of writing displayed here, the vampires have assistants (like the Goths) who are essentially vampire wannabees, and they are referred to as ""Vichy."" I'll give the screenwriters credit for that one. This endless pontificating gives way to even more pontificating on the nature of vampires, and boy does it get old fast, especially when being preached by an actress like Karp. I thought her overacting could not be topped, but I was wrong.The cast gets one more key addition in the form of the satanic priest of the vampires, ""Father Alberto Palmeri"" (Marvin W. Schwartz) who chews the scenery with the worst of them, sacrifices humans, provides meals for needy vampires, and generally is the arch-nemesis of Joe. This, sadly, spawns one of the worst ""dueling priest"" scenes in history. It is so painful that I won't say any more other than it comes to a ridiculous conclusion involving more saliva than should be strictly necessary, much questioning of faith from Gwen (like you couldn't see that coming from a mile away,) a lot of fighting, and a sappy ending. It was a genuine relief when ""Midnight Mass"" rolled the credits. Unfortunately, there are lots of extras, which will prolong the agony for those inclined to watch everything on the disc.The extras include some truly boring bloopers and outtakes, a ""Behind the Camera"" feature featuring interviews with the principals in the film. This is not only extremely boring, but fairly ridiculous. Despite the grandiose claims about breaking new cinematic ground, and the absurd appraisals of the general quality of the film, discerning viewers may not be convinced. Especially if they've already seen the movie. There is a still gallery (in the off chance you didn't see enough,) and there is a commentary track that is possibly the single best feature of the film. Obviously the filmmakers believe the quality of the picture is far superior than I do, but it wasn't as self-aggrandizing as the interviews and did actually contain a few interesting nuggets of information. One morsel of truth I was not surprised to learn were how many of the thespians onscreen were not professional actors, starting right at the beginning with the Goths.

The acting is entirely amateur and ranges from the sub-par (for example, the goth youth collaborators) to the merely dull (alcoholic hero Father Joe) to the whopping ludicrous (Marvin Schwartz as a Catholic priest).
