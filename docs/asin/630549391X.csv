466803,A2T74RP19O2K4Q,630549391X,Ben,"[1, 2]","When Joan Crawford makes her entrance in this film, you know that she isn't going to be reading the Bible any time soon.Away from MGM, she sinks her teeth into the role of Sadie Thompson and she's great as the amoral woman out for a good time (with a few good men).By 1932 the movie-going public was well aware of who Joan Crawford was: the flapper, the mischevious gal with a heart of gold, the wronged woman, the clotheshorse.She is none of these things here, and that is why the movie got such a bad reception upon release: glamorous Joan was nowhere to be found.  By 1932 Crawford was already highly regarded as something of a clotheshorse and (dare I say it) dancer (yikes!) but those films made money.  Here is Joan in her first truly magnifcent acting role and she is taking no prisoners.Her entrance - this hand, that hand, that foot (leg), this foot (leg) and then the shot of her face.  Magnificent!  The only other memorable (female) entrance in a film was shot 14 years later by Lana Turner in ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"".  People hate my reviews, so I know that others will certainly disagree with me.  (Hedy Lamarr in ""White Cargo"" seems to be chump change compared to this).Lewis Milestone directs this and his stagey camera instructions can be forgiven as it is 1932 and the camera really hasn't learned how to ""move"" yet.  It can get claustrophobic at times.But Crawford gives a great performance (even better than in ""Grand Hotel"" or ""Possessed [1931], or ""Paid"".It's a shame that the public took her to task in her first great film role.",4,What an entrance!,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,1561,"['When', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'entrance', 'film', 'know', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'reading', 'Bible', 'time', 'soon.Away', 'MGM', 'teeth', 'role', 'Sadie', 'Thompson', 'great', 'amoral', 'woman', 'out', 'good', 'time', 'few', 'good', 'men', '.By', '1932', 'movie-going', 'public', 'was', 'well', 'aware', 'who', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'was', 'flapper', 'mischevious', 'gal', 'heart', 'gold', 'wronged', 'woman', 'clotheshorse.She', 'none', 'things', 'here', 'why', 'movie', 'got', 'bad', 'reception', 'release', 'glamorous', 'Joan', 'was', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', '1932', 'Crawford', 'was', 'already', 'highly', 'regarded', 'something', 'clotheshorse', 'dare', 'say', 'dancer', 'yikes', 'films', 'made', 'money', 'Here', 'Joan', 'first', 'truly', 'magnifcent', 'acting', 'role', 'taking', 'prisoners.Her', 'entrance', 'hand', 'hand', 'foot', 'leg', 'foot', 'leg', 'then', 'shot', 'face', 'Magnificent', 'only', 'other', 'memorable', 'female', 'entrance', 'film', 'was', 'shot', '14', 'years', 'later', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', 'People', 'hate', 'reviews', 'know', 'others', 'will', 'certainly', 'disagree', 'Hedy', 'Lamarr', 'White', 'Cargo', 'be', 'chump', 'change', 'compared', 'Milestone', 'stagey', 'camera', 'instructions', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', '1932', 'camera', 'really', ""n't"", 'learned', 'how', 'move', 'yet', 'can', 'get', 'claustrophobic', 'times.But', 'Crawford', 'great', 'performance', 'even', 'better', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'Possessed', '[', '1931', ']', 'Paid', '.It', 'shame', 'public', 'took', 'task', 'first', 'great', 'film', 'role']",N/A

Simmons,"[6, 9]","Title: RainRelease Date: 1932Running Time: 93 minutesDirected by: Lewis MilestoneStarring: Joan Crawford as Sadie ThompsonWalter Huston as Rev. Alfred DavidsonWilliam Gargan as Sgt. ""Handsome"" O'HaraBealah Bondi as Mrs. DavidsonGuy Kibbee as Joe HornMatt Moore as Dr. MacPhailRain is a movie that was produced in 1932, prior to the Hayes Production code that radically changed Hollywood when it took effect in 1934.  The movie, which was filmed on Santa Catalina Island, deals with passengers from a steamer that are quarantined for cholera on the South Seas island of Pago Pago.  The passengers, consisting of the Reverend Alfred Davis (Huston), his wife (Bondi), their adult daughter, and prostitute Sadie Thompson (Crawford), take up rooms at the island's general store that is owned and run by Joe Horn (Kibbee).  The steamer's arrival is proceeded by the onset of the rainy season.The free spirited Sadie Thompson has just left Honolulu's red light district en route to the South Seas.  She takes a room downstairs in the store and quickly sets up shop with some local Marines to the immediate consternation of the Rev. Davidson and his family.  No one else, including Mr. Horn and Dr. MacPhail seem to care.  Sadie and her guests first draw the attention of Mrs. Davidson and her daughter by playing records and dancing on the Sabbath.  Mr. Davidson (Huston in a powerful, creepy performance) soon takes it upon himself to ""save"" Sadie and thus change her lifestyle.  The minister uses the power of his stateside organization to pressure the local administration to aid him in his quest.  Through his efforts Sgt. O'Hara, who is in love with and wants to marry Sadie, is thrown in the Brig and the other soldiers discouraged from visiting the store.  Davidson also talks the island's governor into deporting Sadie back to San Francisco (from which she fled to avoid being arrested for an unspecified crime).  The storeowner Horn, while sympathetic to Sadie's plight, is forced to put up with the annoying tirades of the Davidson's because he fears losing his reputation and business if he doesn't.  He continually cautions Sadie to beware of Davidson and the power that he wields.  Dr. MacPhail meanwhile, manages to remain nuetral, although it seems that he too finds the Davidson's overbearing and Sadie victimized.Eventually Davidson manages to brainwash Sadie into changing her ways and being saved.  She soon agrees to be sent back to the States and face her prison sentence (even though she indicates that she was framed).  Before she can leave though, Davidson (who is not as morally pure as he would let on) gives in to temptation and rapes her, breaking the spell of the brainwashing and leading to a suprise finale.This movie was poorly received by the movie going public in 1932, but has come into its own since then.  The movie's message is all the more powerful today given the recent resurgance of conservative religious extremism to the political mainstream.  The Davidson's prudish ways and their desire to enforce them upon the rest of the world are nauseating.  Sadie, while far from a moral angel, is a fun loving, happy go-lucky person who is satisfied to live her life as she pleases without interfering with anyone elses right to do the same.  Her life is nearly ruined by the Davidson's moral crusade.Apparently Milestone didn't want Crawford (who was on loan to him from MGM) to play Sadie, however she more than handles the part.  The movie itself takes place almost entirely on the first floor of Horn's general store during a continuous rainstorm.  This limited setting is carried out by good camera movement and better acting.  The screenplay was based on a story by W. Somerset Maugham.  All of the actors give good performances and the script is very good.The DVD itself (the copy I viewed was from Alpha Video)was a good and very viewable transfer with no extras and good cover art.  It was very worth the price and is especially recommended for persons interested in pre-code Hollywood or those who want to see some of the dangers posed by religious extremism.",3,Rain (1932),1102550400,"12 9, 2004",2004,4098,"['Title', 'RainRelease', 'Date', '1932Running', 'Time', '93', 'minutesDirected', 'Lewis', 'MilestoneStarring', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Sadie', 'ThompsonWalter', 'Huston', 'Rev', 'Alfred', 'DavidsonWilliam', 'Gargan', 'Sgt', 'Handsome', ""O'HaraBealah"", 'Bondi', 'Mrs.', 'DavidsonGuy', 'Kibbee', 'Joe', 'HornMatt', 'Moore', 'Dr.', 'MacPhailRain', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', '1932', 'prior', 'Hayes', 'Production', 'code', 'radically', 'changed', 'Hollywood', 'when', 'took', 'effect', '1934', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'Santa', 'Catalina', 'Island', 'deals', 'passengers', 'steamer', 'are', 'quarantined', 'cholera', 'South', 'Seas', 'island', 'Pago', 'Pago', 'passengers', 'consisting', 'Reverend', 'Alfred', 'Davis', 'Huston', 'wife', 'Bondi', 'adult', 'daughter', 'prostitute', 'Sadie', 'Thompson', 'Crawford', 'take', 'up', 'rooms', 'island', 'general', 'store', 'owned', 'run', 'Joe', 'Horn', 'Kibbee', 'steamer', 'arrival', 'proceeded', 'onset', 'rainy', 'season.The', 'free', 'spirited', 'Sadie', 'Thompson', 'just', 'left', 'Honolulu', 'red', 'light', 'district', 'route', 'South', 'Seas', 'room', 'downstairs', 'store', 'quickly', 'up', 'shop', 'local', 'Marines', 'immediate', 'consternation', 'Rev', 'Davidson', 'family', 'one', 'else', 'including', 'Mr.', 'Horn', 'Dr.', 'MacPhail', 'seem', 'care', 'Sadie', 'guests', 'first', 'draw', 'attention', 'Mrs.', 'Davidson', 'daughter', 'playing', 'records', 'dancing', 'Sabbath', 'Mr.', 'Davidson', 'Huston', 'powerful', 'creepy', 'performance', 'soon', 'save', 'Sadie', 'thus', 'change', 'lifestyle', 'minister', 'power', 'stateside', 'organization', 'pressure', 'local', 'administration', 'aid', 'quest', 'efforts', 'Sgt', ""O'Hara"", 'who', 'love', 'marry', 'Sadie', 'thrown', 'Brig', 'other', 'soldiers', 'discouraged', 'visiting', 'store', 'Davidson', 'also', 'island', 'governor', 'deporting', 'Sadie', 'back', 'San', 'Francisco', 'fled', 'avoid', 'being', 'arrested', 'unspecified', 'crime', 'storeowner', 'Horn', 'sympathetic', 'Sadie', 'plight', 'forced', 'put', 'up', 'annoying', 'tirades', 'Davidson', 'losing', 'reputation', 'business', ""n't"", 'continually', 'Sadie', 'beware', 'Davidson', 'power', 'Dr.', 'MacPhail', 'meanwhile', 'remain', 'nuetral', 'too', 'Davidson', 'overbearing', 'Sadie', 'victimized.Eventually', 'Davidson', 'brainwash', 'Sadie', 'changing', 'ways', 'being', 'saved', 'soon', 'be', 'sent', 'back', 'States', 'face', 'prison', 'sentence', 'even', 'was', 'framed', 'can', 'leave', 'Davidson', 'who', 'not', 'morally', 'pure', 'would', 'let', 'temptation', 'breaking', 'spell', 'brainwashing', 'leading', 'suprise', 'finale.This', 'movie', 'was', 'poorly', 'received', 'movie', 'going', 'public', '1932', 'come', 'own', 'then', 'movie', 'message', 'more', 'powerful', 'today', 'given', 'recent', 'resurgance', 'conservative', 'religious', 'extremism', 'political', 'mainstream', 'Davidson', 'prudish', 'ways', 'desire', 'enforce', 'rest', 'world', 'are', 'nauseating', 'Sadie', 'far', 'moral', 'angel', 'fun', 'loving', 'happy', 'go-lucky', 'person', 'who', 'satisfied', 'live', 'life', 'interfering', 'anyone', 'elses', 'right', 'do', 'same', 'life', 'nearly', 'ruined', 'Davidson', 'moral', 'crusade.Apparently', 'Milestone', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'Crawford', 'who', 'was', 'loan', 'MGM', 'play', 'Sadie', 'however', 'more', 'part', 'movie', 'place', 'almost', 'entirely', 'first', 'floor', 'Horn', 'general', 'store', 'continuous', 'rainstorm', 'limited', 'setting', 'carried', 'good', 'camera', 'movement', 'better', 'acting', 'screenplay', 'was', 'based', 'story', 'W.', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'actors', 'give', 'good', 'performances', 'script', 'very', 'good.The', 'DVD', 'copy', 'viewed', 'was', 'Alpha', 'Video', 'was', 'good', 'very', 'viewable', 'transfer', 'extras', 'good', 'cover', 'art', 'was', 'very', 'worth', 'price', 'especially', 'recommended', 'persons', 'interested', 'pre-code', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'dangers', 'posed', 'religious', 'extremism']",N/A
466805,A51IK68MWKV5R,630549391X,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[1, 2]","There must have been a popular play adaptation of this story that inspired the filming.  The direction is purely point-and-shoot, with only a few shots of rain falling on different areas of the island to break the monotony.Also, the actors are projecting their voices far too much.  I understand that in 1932 sound was in its infancy, but I have seen other films of the period where there was natural-sounding dialogue.The placement of the characters appears to have been gathered from the stage version, as well.  No one's back ever is to the camera, and people walk while talking and not at other times.The acting, however, given the other situations, is exemplary.  Joan Crawford is good (though not great) as Sadie, however Walter Huston appears to be playing a one-note zealot, at least until the one scene when he falls prey to his baser instincts.  He uses dramatic facial expression to show this change, but unfortunately, it only looked to me as if he were about to turn into Mr. Hyde.The other characters are really just spouting dialogue and we aren't told much about them, other than the proprietor of the General Store where the action takes place, Joe Horn.  He is the most interesting character in the film.It was very slow going (I was not previously familiar with the storyline), but after the first half hour, I began to follow and was entertained.I think that it is at the very least a good look at cinema history: to see early Joan Crawford work from when she was a sex symbol, and to catch Walter Huston before son John directed him to an Oscar in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.  Although in order to appreciate director Lewis Milestone's true ability, see All Quiet on the Western Front, The Front Page, or the Lon Chaney, Jr./Burgess Meredith version of Of Mice and Men.",3,"Good acting, but suffers from staginess",1014336000,"02 22, 2002",2002,1796,"['must', 'have', 'been', 'popular', 'play', 'adaptation', 'story', 'inspired', 'filming', 'direction', 'purely', 'point-and-shoot', 'only', 'few', 'shots', 'rain', 'falling', 'different', 'areas', 'island', 'break', 'monotony.Also', 'actors', 'are', 'projecting', 'voices', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'understand', '1932', 'sound', 'was', 'infancy', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'period', 'where', 'was', 'natural-sounding', 'dialogue.The', 'placement', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'gathered', 'stage', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'back', 'ever', 'camera', 'people', 'walk', 'talking', 'not', 'other', 'times.The', 'acting', 'however', 'given', 'other', 'situations', 'exemplary', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'Sadie', 'however', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'be', 'playing', 'one-note', 'zealot', 'least', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'prey', 'baser', 'instincts', 'dramatic', 'facial', 'expression', 'show', 'change', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'looked', 'were', 'about', 'turn', 'Mr.', 'Hyde.The', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'spouting', 'dialogue', 'are', ""n't"", 'told', 'much', 'other', 'proprietor', 'General', 'Store', 'where', 'action', 'place', 'Joe', 'Horn', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'film.It', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'going', 'was', 'not', 'previously', 'familiar', 'storyline', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'began', 'follow', 'was', 'entertained.I', 'think', 'very', 'least', 'good', 'look', 'cinema', 'history', 'see', 'early', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'work', 'when', 'was', 'sex', 'symbol', 'catch', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'son', 'John', 'directed', 'Oscar', 'Treasure', 'Sierra', 'Madre', 'order', 'appreciate', 'director', 'Lewis', 'Milestone', 'true', 'ability', 'see', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'Front', 'Page', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr./Burgess', 'Meredith', 'version', 'Mice', 'Men']",N/A

Sadie is sexy, provocative, outspoken, and very friendly with the male G. I.'s who are also on the island with her.Sadie's ways really tick off Alfred Davidson (played by Walter Houston). Mr. Davidson is a judgmental, prudish missionary that will not rest until he gets Sadie deported. At first, Sadie has no intention of leaving and becomes incredibly indignant. Sadie says, ""you take care of your evil, and I'll take care of mine..."" -- words to live by.But, when she realizes that her deportation would be imminent she becomes very freighted and pleads with Alfred Davidson to allow her to stay.He doesn't relent, but Sadie changes her ways, nevertheless. She is no longer the flashy dresser or ""plaything"" for the men on the island and has accepted her deportation (and subsequent prison sentence in San Francisco.)On the eve of her return there is a climactic outcome and Sadie hightails it to Sydney; back to her old tricks!Joan Crawford was absolutely devastatingly beautiful in this picture, and her acting was firstrate. The fear in Sadie was so believable; and the anger that Sadie had towards the hypocrisy of the missionaries was purely evident. This is without a doubt Joan's best picture of the 30's.Poor Joan was crucified for this film (and for many since) when it was first released in 1932. Joan even publicly apologized to her beloved fans (who meant the world to her), because for the first time in her career they turned their back on her! No one wanted to see Joan Crawford play a wanton women of loose morals. They didn't realize that Joan Crawford was born to play the part of Sadie Thompson.This is one of my favorite Joan Crawford pictures, because her true acting abilities really shine. She also plays a very different character; since she was on loan from MGM she was no longer tied to the sweet love-triangles that they gave her during her heyday in the 30's.

466809,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,630549391X,Linda Linguvic,"[2, 4]","Joan Crawford is cast as Sadie Thompson and Walter Huston as the preacher in this 1932 version of the Somerset Maugham classic.  Shot in black and white, the video and soundtrack are somewhat scratchy, but the quality of the screenplay and the performances shine through.  The mood of the film is dark and shadowy throughout, and the Pacific island seems hot, wet and  foreboding.  Even the opening shot of soldiers marching in the rain and singing a song about how they expected a paradise when they signed up but were now disillusioned, sets the tone for the piece.I never realized how attractive Joan Crawford was in her early days and this role calls for her to play both the hard edged prostitute as well as the newly converted former sinner. Both these personas come across loud and clear.  Walter Huston plays the preacher role sincerely, as a true believer who wants to save Sadie's soul.  Later, we see his inner conflict by just the look on his face, as his eyes glisten and he turns towards the closed door of her room.  There are a lot of shadows and a lot of close-ups and a lot of long, lingering looks between the actors.

Maybe the subject matter was too far over the heads of Depression era audiences. ""Rain"" is fine today as a vintage relic of adult filmmaking. It concerns a group of missionaries who land on the tropical isle of Pago Pago during rainy season to save the souls of the ""sinful"" natives who are otherwise living in blissful harmony. Unfortunately, a group of Marines gets stranded there as well and among them is the colorful Sadie Thompson (Crawford), a woman of easy virtue and proud of it. The Marines love her and she parties hardy with them much to the shock and chagrin of the missionaries--- particularly the Reverends' self righteous wife (Beulah Bondi). She complains loudly and the Reverend determines to cast out the ""evil"" from Sadies' soul even though Sadie is just fine with it the way it is. Their confrontations eventually lead to a near exorcism of Sadie and she succumbs to the Reverends' power. But the rain doesn't let up and the jungle drums keep pounding in the night. The Reverend succumbs to a power of a different kind---that of the unleashing of long pent up sexual frustration and he rapes Sadie thus sealing his own fate as the real ""lost soul"". Walter Huston is stagily effective as the pompous Reverend and Crawford is nothing short of magnetic as Sadie. A definite curio from the pre-code 30's and an interesting look at a young Joan Crawford.

466811,A35FEM4C0LQTPN,630549391X,Mike Leone,"[28, 30]","When I bought my first VCR back in the mid-1980s, the first commercial tape I purchased was a cheapie of &quot;Rain.&quot;  I knew nothing about the story line and not much more about Joan Crawford other than &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; and how she had been portrayed in &quot;Mommie Dearest.&quot;  While the tape was only of medium quality (I would later buy both better and worse from the same company), it was good enough to enthrall me with the film.&quot;Rain&quot; tells one of those timeless stories that still has a lot to say to audiences today:  missionary succeeds in reforming sinful woman but then succumbs to her charms.  It had already been filmed as a silent with Gloria Swanson and would later be made into a color film with songs starring Rita Hayworth.  Jules Massenet's opera &quot;Thais&quot; has a very similar plot line.Joan Crawford made this film at a time when she was mainly playing ambitious shopgirls clawing their way to the top.  &quot;Rain,&quot; for which MGM loaned her out after her big success with &quot;Grand Hotel,&quot; was a very different kettle of fish than her usual 1930s heroine and gives her a chance to really stretch herself.Made up more than Gloria Swanson or Rita Hayworth ever thought of being, Joan's performance is similarly over-the-top but fascinating.  Our first view of her begins preparing us for her portrayal:  the camera first shows, one at a time, her two jewelry-bedecked wrists, then her two high-heeled-shod feet, and then finally her face, cigarette dangling from her mouth, and we have no doubt as to the kind of woman we are looking at.  And to hear her as she speaks her first word, &quot;Boys,&quot; is to understand why she thought her voice had been dubbed in by a man the first time she heard herself in a talkie test.Sadie is vulnerable almost from her first appearance onscreen, asking for a room in the little hotel in Pago Pago because she has no money, and explaining, Flaemmchen-like, that she doesn't eat very much.  And William Gargan as O'Hara, the innocent young sailor who is smitten with her from the first time he sees her, recognizes her sweet, gentle quality, calling her a &quot;lady,&quot; much to the delight of his friends.  And Joan's softer side responds to his innocent quality, as she chooses O'Hara (whom she calls &quot;Handsome&quot;) over the other men.Walter Huston, the Reverend Mr. Davidson, is Sadie's nemesis.  His role is a little more one-dimensional, but he plays the cold, unflinching and ultimately all-too-human preacher very convincingly.  He does manage to garner at least some sympathy, both because of his suicide and especially as compared to his extremely self-righteous wife, played by Beulah Bondi (when I first saw Beulah Bondi's sympathetic portrayal of James Stewart's mother in &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; I had a difficult time believing such polar opposites could be played by the same actress).The turning point in the film is Sadie's conversion from sinner to penitent, and here it falls a little bit short.  But this is a fault of the script itself rather than the actors:  Sadie's actual conversion happens with very little motivation, so it is difficult to take seriously.  But even if Joan is not up to the challenge of making Sadie's conversion believable (I don't know that anybody else would be, either), she more than compensates for it when she tells O'Hara how she doesn't know why she chosen to be saved, she only knows she was.  This for me is the single most memorable moment of the film.  And she is equally great when she says, after learning of Davidson's death, &quot;now I can forgive him&quot; (shades of Puccini's Tosca).Much has been made of director Lewis Milestone's camera tricks, but what I really love about his direction is how he introduces any number of interesting little contrasts and parallels.  For example, while the Christians read the Bible, pray, and yet display no sympathy for the plight of others, Guy Kibbee, as the sympathetic proprietor of the hotel who has helped Sadie when she had no place to stay, reads writings by the atheist Nietzsche.  And while our first view of Sadie is by way of her wrists and feet, our last view of Davidson is by way of his feet, washing up onshore after he has remorsefully cut his throat.The quality of this DVD reflects a marked improvement over the VHS tape I have owned for years, with strong contrasts in shading between light and dark.  There is very little on the DVD in the way of extra features:  separate listings of the cast and credits, and that's about it.&quot;Rain&quot; remains to this day one of my favorite movies.  And I give it five stars because of the story line, still relevant almost 70 years later, the wonderful portrayal by Crawford, ably assisted by a srong supporting cast, and the greatly improved technical quality of the film.",5,A unique Joan Crawford portrayal,985564800,"03 26, 2001",2001,4868,"['When', 'bought', 'first', 'VCR', 'back', 'mid-1980s', 'first', 'commercial', 'tape',

And along comes Sadie Thompson, Prostitute of the South Seas, the Original Good Time Had By All, and off Joan went, to revel in a meaty role made famous by contemporary theatrical actress Tallulah Bankhead.Panned by an unimaginative set of critics, and reviled by a public used to seeing La Carwford as the Ingenue shopgirl in such fluff as 'Our Dancing Daughters' and 'West Point', it's really a testament to the fickleness of the moviegoing public that this, a movie of really sterling performances and interesting, almost experimental direction, could have been so overlooked.Joan plays Sadie, a hooker on the run, who is forced into an island-wide quarantine after her connecting boat ride is infected with cholera. Among the other passengers so stuck is Rev. Davidson (Walter Huston), who, upon discovering Sadie's sluttish past, becomes hell-bent on 'saving' her soul.Joan gives an honest and raw performance here, and does not try to glamorise or romanticise the heroine. Hers is a bitter and hard-edged Sadie, full of bile towards men and the establishment, yet tender and vulnerable when the role demands. Her range as an actress is showcased here in the excellent exchanges with Rev. Devine, and Walter Huston responds in kind with a terrific rendition of the sanctimonious, dictatorial Man of the Cloth.Direction by Lewis Milestone is highly remarkable for the period, the stacatto rainfall and panoramic camera sweeps contrast beautifully with the enclosed, claustrophobic interiors of the General Store, and the poverty and primitive status of the isalnd community shines through, lending a feeling of wilderness to the piece.All in all, this is an excellent picture, and one of Crawford's finest performances.

Now they can see it struck from a near-immaculate print and enjoy both the gorgeous cinematography and those wild closeups of Joan. A friend of mine who is not a Crawford fan described her look in this movie as &quot;Makeup Poisoning&quot;. Personally, I love Joan's characterization of South Seas prostitute Sadie Thompson. Highly stylized, it's a little ridiuclous, but  compelling. In her &quot;redeemed&quot; scenes  Sadie is quite moving (and stunningly beautiful! This was Crawford at her peak). Sadie's ascent up the staircase to confront Walter Houston's lustful preacher is brilliantly handled and has to be one of Joan's best confrontation scenes ever --ranking  right up there with Mildred slapping Veda. A little talky and slow in spots, but the rewards are worth the wait.",5,Joan Shines in Spruced-Up Classic,1052611200,"05 11, 2003",2003,916,"['Crawford', 'fans', 'already', 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'famous', 'flop', 'Joan', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'performances', 'Now', 'can', 'see', 'struck', 'near-immaculate', 'print', 'enjoy', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'wild', 'closeups', 'Joan', 'A', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'not', 'Crawford', 'fan', 'described', 'look', 'movie', 'quot', 'Makeup', 'Poisoning', 'quot', 'Personally', 'love', 'Joan', 'characterization', 'South', 'Seas', 'prostitute', 'Sadie', 'Thompson', 'Highly', 'stylized', 'little', 'ridiuclous', 'compelling', 'quot', 'redeemed', 'quot', 'scenes', 'Sadie', 'quite', 'moving', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'was', 'Crawford', 'peak', 'Sadie', 'ascent', 'staircase', 'confront', 'Walter', 'Houston', 'lustful', 'preacher', 'brilliantly', 'handled', 'be', 'one', 'Joan', 'best', 'confrontation', 'scenes', 'ever', 'ranking', 'right', 'there', 'Mildred', 'slapping', 'Veda', 'little', 'talky', 'slow', 'spots', 'rewards', 'are', 'wait']",N/A

I was genuinely surprised at how good it was.  Crawford is wonderful as the tough-talking tramp who is &quot;saved&quot; by the Reverend.  She is great at projecting the vulnerability inside Sadie before and during her conversion to penitent, and how, despite her lack of faith in humanity being being well-placed. that that vulnerability remains after her conversion back to tramp.  A great performance that was considered a flop in 1932 (Critics at the time said the role was all but beyond her) that works far better today.  It also give you a whiff of the raw sexuality that Crawford exuded in her early movies that made her the Madonna of her day.

But this is just so boring to watch, and you wonder why they bothered going on location to Catalina Island - all you mostly see is the stage stuff anyway.  The film apparently got bad reviews when it was first released, and Crawford herself said if she could have re-done it, she would have as the overall film lacked spark -she also referred to her own acting as too over the top.  This is one of her worst films in my opinion, yet it was one of the first they released on DVD.  Why not release the good ones first - like Mildred Pierce?  What's wrong with movie companies? The quality of this DVD is also really bad despite my copy saying &quot;Digitally remastered from the original print&quot;. It was so poor that it kept fading in and out.  For the collectors of oldies only.  Sorry the review could not be more positive, but  i dont want you wasting money on a bad product.",1,"DVD quality poor, storyline poor",1029628800,"08 18, 2002",2002,937,"['am', 'Crawford', 'fan', 'also', 'enjoy', 'old', 'B', 'amp', 'W', 'movies', 'just', 'so', 'boring', 'watch', 'wonder', 'why', 'bothered', 'going', 'location', 'Catalina', 'Island', 'mostly', 'see', 'stage', 'stuff', 'anyway', 'film', 'apparently', 'got', 'bad', 'reviews', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'Crawford', 'said', 'could', 'have', 're-done', 'would', 'have', 'overall', 'film', 'lacked', 'spark', '-she', 'also', 'referred', 'own', 'acting', 'too', 'top', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'opinion', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'released', 'DVD', 'Why', 'not', 'release', 'good', 'ones', 'first', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'What', 'wrong', 'movie', 'companies', 'quality', 'DVD', 'also', 'really', 'bad', 'copy', 'saying', 'quot', 'Digitally', 'remastered', 'original', 'print', 'quot', 'was', 'so', 'poor', 'kept', 'fading', 'collectors', 'oldies', 'only', 'Sorry', 'review', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'positive', 'i', 'dont', 'want', 'wasting', 'money', 'bad', 'product']",N/A
