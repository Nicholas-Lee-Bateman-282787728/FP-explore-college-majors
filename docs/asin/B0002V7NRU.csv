845449,A1R69KU700LIY4,B0002V7NRU,CynDee,"[0, 0]","Over all I liked the Series but with Sam (Ally Walker) leaving they could have renamed it to VCTF. Because in Season 4 it really seemed to become more about the whole team, as opposed to Sam and her being persued, victimized, attacked, harrassed, terroized and eventually tortured abit even by Jack and his fall guys. Im deffinitly glad he was taken down finally, unless it was just another fall guy...lol. =PAnyway, Yes I know the rest of the team was there and had thier parts, run ins and what not in the previous 3 Seasons. But it just really seemed centered on Jack and his hmmm...hard-on I guess for Sam. I guess because she was a challenge for him and gave him a reason to continue living, and yes continued killing, when he seemed about to quit from what was inferred. The others were thrown in here and there with thier own stories in the beginning, which thankfully did get more involved as the seasons progressed to add to the tapestry of the story.This last season, #4, started off fine but then they decided (The writers I guess) that Rachel (Jamie Luner) needed her own stalker. Im not sure why, maybe because it worked the first time around. But to me it was more like: Oh no, Not again. It all started because Rachel was not willing to kiss a superiors @$$, or lie to save face for him so he could get some recordings, was pretty much what I got out of it. I didnt like how It was left off at the end either with Rachel sitting in a jail cell and VCTF being shutdown, cliffhangers can be entertaining but this one just left a bad taste in the mouth, unless there was a TV movie or book made that I missed that addressed what happened it was very disappointing. If it werent for some really good episodes, like the one on the city dam with the sniper is one that really stands out to me, then I dont think Id have kept this one. It just sounds like another victim of the Reality Crap craze that was getting started up then, Like recently with the way the economy has been its-(Reality TV) been able to take down many great shows these days which is very disheartening, I guess Ill go back to reading to get my dose of good stories in and periodically go back to re-watch everything thats thankfully made it to DVD.I loved the Cast and the acting and the interactions they had with each other, they were all great. Ally Walker, Robert Davi, Erica Gimpel, Roma Maffia, Peter Frechette, Jamie Luner and everyone were all great and it was very enjoyable to watch them, if a little serious what with being a crime show (Kind of supposed to be though, I thought. Crime is not usually funny unless it involves some dumb-@$$ criminals getting caught doing stupid stuff, like in 2 certain movies that were made in the 90's -H*** A**** Im not sure if its apporpriate to Name them here since this is about Profiler- At any rate it wasnt very realistic what happens to them but I laughed my @$$ off anyways when they got what was coming to them.) Maybe they could have had some lighter moments to offset the more heavy ones, and if the rumor was true about why Ally left then maybe she wouldnt have left if thered been some funny/lighter moments. Even so I enjoyed watching Jamie Luner even if for a short time.Another episode thats stands out to me though was the story with George (Peter Frechette) catching up to and almost killing the thug that robbed his friends video store and almost killed him and his 2 friends during the robbery but only didnt because the gun jammed. That was a powerful moment to me and great acting on Peters part in my oppinion. I was even yelling at the TV: Yeah how do you like it B1tc#!, when George caught up to the thug in the alley threw him against the wall and held his gun to the thugs head. ""Please dont shoot me! I got a kid!"" he pleaded. Im like: So that makes it ok for you to rob the video store, hurt the customers and employees and intend to kill George because hes FBI and you found his badge and you felt you had to act bad to the FBI agent? *Rolls eyes* Id have had a hard time NOT pulling the trigger on his lame-@$$ myself.Still they could have changed the name on this last season and made it a spin off, maybe even brought Sam back from time to time to help out or just pop in to see Bailey, perhaps even once a season so we can see the progress her and her daughter has made and what not, I doubt that Ally would have objected to that. It deffinitly had more potential though than to be left the way it was. Thats why Im giving this one a 3, instead of 3 & 1/2 since Im not sure how to or if its possible to give, 1/2 stars.Anyway this is all only my oppinion, take care everyone.
