While the filming and sound quality left a lot to be desired, the story, the depth of the characters, and the redeeming nature of this movie brought me to tears.  Every young girl should watch this movie and realize that the 'bad boys' just aren't worth the time and trouble.  BTW, Leo Penn (Sean Penn's father, no less) was excellent in this role.  I really believed he was playing that piano; those eyes were full of fire and sadness.It was curious to me how 'unwanted' pregnancies were handled back then.  It left me wondering if the government funded those hospitals.  Somehow I doubt it.As for particulars, I loved the line, ""If you have a headache, baby, don't share it with the world!""  All around great acting and totally worth the time spent.  Thanks Amazon, for putting this on Prime.  I totally enjoyed it!EDIT:  My 18 yo daughter just watched this with me and she loved it too.

She really gets to the heart of the matter. I always wish there was a bit more just to see more of what she put together. I really enjoy the cast. they seem to work well together from what it seems coming across the screen. The movies hold the 'necessaries' for the subjects being presented. (the one on polio/ disabilities and again here with an unexpected pregnancy.) I appreciate the way 'shame' is approached and the people brought in with such compassion. Showing a true-to-life approach at the 'delicate/difficult' subjects. And timeless lessons.The films might not hold the interest of younger children, yet they are done with a taste that anyone could be in the room watching or overhearing. (Yes, the always present cigarette and touches of 'drink' are there, yet the cigarette thing was not realized for far too long.) At one part, the cigarette seemed to portray the stepping stones in the lives of the Sally Forrest characters. Speaking of which, the two main actors are really good. As I stated before, they blend together. They showed quite a bit of the baby's father, a bit more of his feelings and also the girl's attempt to interest him in making 'things permanent' without either of them knowing her situation. No manipulation on her part. Just trusting. An all-too-familiar story done so well here. Along with the portrayal of not-so-perfect homelife. That part in itself ought to get folks thinking - how parents might act and react differently.  Good threads all thru the movie and some the viewer is left to 'write' on their own. ""Food for thought"", so to say!I did sorta think that maybe the long stairway scene at end of ""Unwed Mother"" would have been difficult for the handicap 'Drew', that maybe he could have been going up the last one and fallen, and then Sally would have had to 'bend pride' a bit to 'return' to him and then assist Drew. Meet 'halfways' so to say, to show an action of compassion to match his, I guess is a good way to explain what I am trying to say here. [just an extra touch that 'speaks louder than words'] and Miss Lupino's movies have that all thru them.
