1162862,A14OJS0VWMOSWO,B0019BI11E,Midwest Book Review,"[14, 14]","As seen on NBC, Jane and the Dragon: A Dragon's Tale is a children's DVD collection showcasing the first five episodes of a marvelous children's animated series based on author Martin Baynton's best-selling children's books. Brought to life with Weta Workshop's stunning, three-dimensional computer animation - so advanced as to show the fluid movement of Jane's fiery red hair and the natural flow of characters' clothing - Jane and the Dragon: A Dragon's Tale stars a spunky, twelve-year-old heroine who wasn't content simply to grow up to be a lady-in-waiting. She dared to face a fearsome dragon and rescue Prince Cuthbert; her bravery earned her special permission from King Caradoc to begin training as a knight's apprentice. At the beginning of the first episode, Jane is already working hard at her training, and has formed a fast friendship with the witty and easygoing Dragon - but her first test to be worthy of her chosen path as a future knight looms large! Other episodes show the dilemma of Jane's friend the Jester challenged to a duel of honor by a much larger, stronger, and more experienced opponent; the difficulties Jane must face in learning to work as a team with her fellow squire; and her personal troubles when her mother forbids her to attend the castle ball as a knight, stipulating that she must wear a gown or not go at all. Superb voice acting, captivating visuals worthy of the theater screen, and intelligent writing sure to entertain viewers of all ages make Jane and the Dragon: A Dragon's Tale a superb DVD ideal as a gift for dragon lovers of all ages and enthusiastically recommended for school and community library DVD collections for children.",5,A superb DVD ideal as a gift for dragon lovers of all ages,1220659200,"09 6, 2008",2008,1684,"['seen', 'NBC', 'Jane', 'Dragon', 'Dragon', 'Tale', 'children', 'DVD', 'collection', 'showcasing', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'marvelous', 'children', 'animated', 'series', 'based', 'author', 'Martin', 'Baynton', 'best-selling', 'children', 'books', 'Brought', 'life', 'Weta', 'Workshop', 'stunning', 'three-dimensional', 'computer', 'animation', 'so', 'advanced', 'show', 'fluid', 'movement', 'Jane', 'fiery', 'red', 'hair', 'natural', 'flow', 'characters', 'clothing', 'Jane', 'Dragon', 'Dragon', 'Tale', 'spunky', 'twelve-year-old', 'heroine', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'content', 'simply', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'lady-in-waiting', 'dared', 'face', 'fearsome', 'dragon', 'rescue', 'Prince', 'Cuthbert', 'bravery', 'earned', 'special', 'permission', 'King', 'Caradoc', 'begin', 'training', 'knight', 'apprentice', 'beginning', 'first', 'episode', 'Jane', 'already', 'working', 'hard', 'training', 'formed', 'fast', 'friendship', 'witty', 'easygoing', 'Dragon', 'first', 'test', 'be', 'worthy', 'chosen', 'path', 'future', 'knight', 'large', 'Other', 'episodes', 'show', 'dilemma', 'Jane', 'friend', 'Jester', 'challenged', 'duel', 'honor', 'much', 'larger', 'stronger', 'more', 'experienced', 'opponent', 'difficulties', 'Jane', 'must', 'face', 'learning', 'work', 'team', 'fellow', 'squire', 'personal', 'troubles', 'when', 'mother', 'attend', 'castle', 'ball', 'knight', 'stipulating', 'must', 'wear', 'gown', 'not', 'go', 'Superb', 'voice', 'acting', 'captivating', 'visuals', 'worthy', 'theater', 'screen', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'sure', 'entertain', 'viewers', 'ages', 'make', 'Jane', 'Dragon', 'Dragon', 'Tale', 'superb', 'DVD', 'ideal', 'gift', 'dragon', 'lovers', 'ages', 'enthusiastically', 'recommended', 'school', 'community', 'library', 'DVD', 'collections', 'children']",Jane And The Dragon: A Dragon's Tale
