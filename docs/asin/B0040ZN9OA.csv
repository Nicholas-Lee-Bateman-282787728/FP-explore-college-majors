1379731,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0040ZN9OA,Andy Orrock,"[3, 3]","Like most viewers, I was stunned at how much I enjoyed this superb documentary from Jon Hock.  Even my wife - who I can say, without reservation, despises the sport of football and football culture - was smitten by this compelling story.In choosing this subject, Hock has rightfully judged the tale of Marcus Dupree as the great, untold sports story of the last 30 years.  That Dupree is my contemporary makes it superbly fascinating to me and people of my generation.  Like me, I'm sure they all said ""Yeah, whatever happened to this guy?""  And, like me, I'm sure they were saddened and appalled to see how Dupree was misled, poorly advised and stripped of his youthful enthusiasm.  It's appalling that an 18-year-old young man of so much promise is placed into a position of having to make a series of difficult life decisions 'advised' (a word used very loosely here) by adults with motives that were, at best, unclear or, at worst, clearly self-serving.  Of those, Reverend Ken Fairley comes out of Hock's film taking the biggest drubbing.  Neither Hock nor his camera takes down Fairley.  The reverend does the damage by and to himself.Ultimately, Hock's film is about perseverance and triumph of character.  The winner: the Marcus Dupree, a regal man who betrays not an iota of bitterness or sadness.  What makes Hock's story work more than anything is that its protagonist - the current version of Marcus Dupree, not the one of 30-year-old gridiron glory - is a supremely likable gentleman, completely at peace with his life.But, of the football, one note: in interviews, Hock has said that part of the intrigue of Dupree is that his exploits pre-dated the ESPN era, when everything is videoed, documented and on full display in a highlights package within minutes.  By contrast, not only did Dupree not get that treatment, his high school day exploits were solely of the 'passed down myth' variety.  Until, that is, Hock and his crew learn that there is one, reclusive man who has a series of Super 8 tapes squirreled away in a box.  After repeated entreaties from Hock and others, the tapes wind up in their hands.  As Hock says, his hands trembled as they threaded the tapes for a first viewing.Hock's take at that exact moment: ""If all these runs are seven yards off-tackle, we don't have a film.""What they found in those canisters instead: Pure magic.See the film to appreciate what that moment must have been like.",5,Think you don't care about Marcus Dupree?
