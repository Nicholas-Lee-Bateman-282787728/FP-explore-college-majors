514102,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B00002AFX2,JGC,"[2, 3]","""Baby Dance"" is a low-budget, made-for-cable (Showtime) movie that has since been passed down to Encore, where it is in current rotation. The movie follows the fictional story of Rachel (Stockard Channing) and Wanda (Laura Dern). Rachel agrees to adopt Wanda's baby as she and her hubby Richard (Peter Riegert) desperately want a baby. The movie is very haunting in its realism because although it may look like a typical women's movie it certainly isn't because all of the charters are so raw and real and emotional. My favorite character is Rachel because we really got to know her and although she was not having the baby, the story sort of centered around her need to have a child. The movie may also shock you, as it did me. The scenes of Wanda's lifestyle were rather tragic. She lived just as dirty as the dirt road she lived on. The movie includes many melodramatic scenes which may cause you to think about the realms concerning an open adoption such as this. I found the character of Al (Richard Lineback) complex because he was a man conflicted; one minute he had a lot of rage and anger that came spilling out in all different directions and the next moment he was either silent or sensitive. I did find the scene of Al in bed, spread-eagle, naked as a jaybird totally unnecessary, but I am sure the producers threw it in to capitalize on their built-in chick audience. If you can catch the movie on Encore I recommend watching it as it's a fine character portrait. I also recomend watching the movie to anyone that's studying ethics or even family law because as the movie articulates, it takes much more than just biological lineage, not to mention money and contracts to adopt an unwanted baby.",3,"overdone fluff, but a strong supporting cast and a fairly decent storyline",1261180800,"12 19, 2009",2009,1709,"['Baby', 'Dance', 'low-budget', 'made-for-cable', 'Showtime', 'movie', 'been', 'passed', 'Encore', 'where', 'current', 'rotation', 'movie', 'fictional', 'story', 'Rachel', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Wanda', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'Rachel', 'adopt', 'Wanda', 'baby', 'hubby', 'Richard', 'Peter', 'Riegert', 'desperately', 'want', 'baby', 'movie', 'very', 'haunting', 'realism', 'may', 'look', 'typical', 'women', 'movie', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'charters', 'are', 'so', 'raw', 'real', 'emotional', 'favorite', 'character', 'Rachel', 'really', 'got', 'know', 'was', 'not', 'having', 'baby', 'story', 'sort', 'centered', 'need', 'have', 'child', 'movie', 'may', 'also', 'shock', 'did', 'scenes', 'Wanda', 'lifestyle', 'were', 'rather', 'tragic', 'lived', 'just', 'as', 'dirty', 'dirt', 'road', 'lived', 'movie', 'many', 'melodramatic', 'scenes', 'may', 'cause', 'think', 'realms', 'concerning', 'open', 'adoption', 'such', 'found', 'character', 'Al', 'Richard', 'Lineback', 'complex', 'was', 'man', 'conflicted', 'one', 'minute', 'had', 'lot', 'rage', 'anger', 'came', 'spilling', 'out', 'different', 'directions', 'next', 'moment', 'was', 'silent', 'sensitive', 'did', 'find', 'scene', 'Al', 'bed', 'spread-eagle', 'naked', 'jaybird', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'am', 'sure', 'producers', 'threw', 'capitalize', 'built-in', 'chick', 'audience', 'can', 'catch', 'movie', 'Encore', 'recommend', 'watching', 'fine', 'character', 'portrait', 'also', 'recomend', 'watching', 'movie', 'anyone', 'studying', 'ethics', 'even', 'family', 'law', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'biological', 'lineage', 'not', 'mention', 'money', 'contracts', 'adopt', 'unwanted', 'baby']",N/A

I won't spoil it for you, but this is a movie which challenges every viewer to ask themselves, ""what would I do, given the same situation?""The final scene is absolutely haunting and will stay with me for a long time. You are left with this instinctive reaction to judge the characters for their choices -- both sides, all sides -- until you stop to think, ""what if it were me? What would I do?"" Personally, I don't know what I would do if I were any one of those individuals. There's no 'good guy' or 'bad guy' in this one.
