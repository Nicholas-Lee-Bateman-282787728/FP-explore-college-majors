1264689,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002E01M9M,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","The story of &#8216;Gervaise&#8217; reminded me, in many ways, of my beloved &#8216;Les Miserables&#8217;.  The atmosphere and expanse of storytelling more than anything else.  While the film does deal with similar themes, it is entirely its own story.  Still, the comparison was a benefit, at least for me, since it made me fall even quicker in love with this tale.&#8216;Gervaise&#8217; tells the story of a young mother who is a gimp, working hard to support herself and her mooching boyfriend who eventually leaves her destitute and alone, and with her name smeared all over the towns gossip.  She moves on from this tragedy to find and fall for a seemingly charming man who wants to take care of her.  Sadly, on the eve of a life changing event (where Gervaise is going to become her own boss, buying a launderette), her husband has a tragic accident that costs him his job and his confidence.  While on the outset it may appear that they have collectively moved on from this tragedy, Gervaise&#8217;s husband Henri has turned to alcohol to kill his pain and this has caused a riff in their marriage.  Enter a few faces from the past that only bring with them conniving pain and misery and you have the story of Gervaise&#8217;s life.Overall, this is a tremendous film from renowned French director Rene Clement.  The performances across the board are stellar, with the men in Gervaise&#8217;s life taking center stage.  Francois Perier is devastating as Henri, but for me it was Armand Mestral who stole the whole film as the conniving and self-centered Lantier.  He&#8217;s devilish in all the right places and completely gets under the skin with a single glace.  I love an actor that is working it, even when he&#8217;s not the focal point of a scene.  He lingers in the background and his face says so much.  Maria Schell is very good here, except for the fact that she seemed to forget she had a gimp in some parts of the film, which was a shame.&#8216;Gervaise&#8217; is a marvelously detailed film that will reach into your soul and yank a piece of it out!",5,Tragically beautiful&#8230;,1402012800,"06 6, 2014",2014,2068,"['story', '8216', 'Gervaise', '8217', 'reminded', 'many', 'ways', 'beloved', '8216', 'Les', 'Miserables', '8217', 'atmosphere', 'expanse', 'storytelling', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'deal', 'similar', 'themes', 'entirely', 'own', 'story', 'Still', 'comparison', 'was', 'benefit', 'least', 'made', 'fall', 'even', 'quicker', 'love', 'tale.', '8216', 'Gervaise', '8217', 'story', 'young', 'mother', 'who', 'gimp', 'working', 'hard', 'support', 'mooching', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'eventually', 'destitute', 'alone', 'name', 'smeared', 'towns', 'gossip', 'tragedy', 'find', 'fall', 'seemingly', 'charming', 'man', 'who', 'take', 'care', 'Sadly', 'eve', 'life', 'changing', 'event', 'where', 'Gervaise', 'going', 'become', 'own', 'boss', 'buying', 'launderette', 'husband', 'tragic', 'accident', 'job', 'confidence', 'outset', 'may', 'appear', 'have', 'collectively', 'moved', 'tragedy', 'Gervaise', '8217', 's', 'husband', 'Henri', 'turned', 'alcohol', 'kill', 'pain', 'caused', 'riff', 'marriage', 'Enter', 'few', 'past', 'only', 'bring', 'conniving', 'pain', 'misery', 'have', 'story', 'Gervaise', '8217', 'life.Overall', 'tremendous', 'film', 'renowned', 'French', 'director', 'Rene', 'Clement', 'performances', 'board', 'are', 'stellar', 'men', 'Gervaise', '8217', 's', 'life', 'taking', 'center', 'stage', 'Francois', 'Perier', 'devastating', 'Henri', 'was', 'Armand', 'Mestral', 'who', 'stole', 'whole', 'film', 'conniving', 'self-centered', 'Lantier', '8217', 's', 'devilish', 'right', 'places', 'completely', 'skin', 'single', 'glace', 'love', 'actor', 'working', 'even', 'when', '8217', 'not', 'focal', 'point', 'scene', 'background', 'face', 'so', 'much', 'Maria', 'Schell', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'fact', 'seemed', 'forget', 'had', 'gimp', 'parts', 'film', 'was', 'shame.', '8216', 'Gervaise', '8217', 'marvelously', 'detailed', 'film', 'will', 'reach', 'soul', 'yank', 'piece', 'out']",Essential Art House: Gervaise

First search for a good price. Mine $6.53 - an amazing price (plus postage to U/K of course). The Dvd box is secure and good. There is a useful little leaflet inside which includes a cast list (Thank You Criterion). The print is more than decent - it's very good - crystal clear B/W in 4.3 ratio. Subtitles are easy to read. So that's all good. Maria Schell is superb, and whilst the film is hardly a bunch of laughs, it is so beautifully, lovingly made that you can't help being sorry when it's over (well I couldn't).

1264691,A1MQ9NPY6M5H9H,B002E01M9M,Ballet Fan,"[0, 0]","Director Rene Clement and actress Maria Schell excel in this adaptation of the novel ""L'Assommoir"" (""The Dram Shop"") by French literary writer Emile Zola.  Schell plays a young mother with a partially disabled leg, who works very hard to support her family by starting her own Laundry business in a working-class slum in Paris of the 19th century, only to have the fruits of her labor consumed and her work ultimately destroyed by two men: her unfaithful, parasitic ex-husband and her alcoholic, dead-beat second husband.  It is a tragic tale of the consequences for women of paternalistic property laws and restrictive divorce laws.  The last scene (""The Absinthe Drinker"" by Edgard Degas?) is not pretty.  One can only admire the spirit with which Gervaise struggles, against insuperable odds, to make a decent life for herself and her children.

Based on &Eacute;mile Zola's novel ""L'assommoir"", Maria Schell gives an unforgettable performance in the title role of ""Gervaise"", she was simply magical! The film paints a very ugly truth and fact: in how women and children are the real victims of poverty! In romanized/chauvinistic societies like that of France (including Spain, Italy, Portugal, and Latin America for that matter), women have no real say (this of course, has moderated greatly since those days), and the exploited become exploiters themselves (especially the men, here however, the villainous character of 'Virginie' excellently played by Suzy Delair, easily gave the men a run for their money). An exception was the character of 'Goujet' (Jaques Harden), who truly symbolized the principles of ""Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity"", and offered 'Gervaise' a way out. She however, continued to make very poor choices, and was ensnared in her downward spiral. I don't want to give anymore away, so as to spoil it for anyone! An excellent film, by one of the world's true 'auteurs' (I'm sure even David Lean must have been very impressed with the cinematography, editing, etc., etc.). I highly recommend this powerful film!

1264693,A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4,B002E01M9M,Gerard D. Launay,"[2, 4]","A story about life in the Parisian slums?  No maudlin sentimentality, no sex, no murder, no rape, no villains?  This is as dead realistic a view of the working class world of 19th century Europe as we are ever likely to see in film.  It is the very lack of fake sentimentality that distinguishes this, from let's say, a typical Dickens film.Why is this a great picture?  The first reason is the marvelous performance of Maria Schell as ""Gervaise.""  Until the very end, when her small laundry business is trashed by her alcoholic, abusive husband, she faces her harsh life with optimism and sheer determination. There are touching scenes as when she celebrates her birthday with a delicious roast goose dripping with juice that is shared with her neighbors, friends, and employees...or when she reaches for a kiss from her lover. There are exciting moments when she gets into a vicious cat-fight with another laundress over her husband's infidelity. And there is the poignant last scene when she sinks into alcoholism herself after her business and self-worth is ultimately lost, through no fault of her own.The director pays a lot of attention to all the characters in this rich film. In addition, he presents us with Paris scenes that are unbelievably realistic...down to the cobblestones, the worn clothes, and the dirty old street fronts.  Zola, even more than Victor Hugo, made the life of the working poor vivid in print.  Rene Clement should be congratulated for respecting the source material and bringing it to life as accurately as possible.",5,This is what divides French from American Film,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,1550,"['story', 'life', 'Parisian', 'slums', 'maudlin', 'sentimentality', 'sex', 'murder', 'rape', 'villains', 'dead', 'realistic', 'view', 'working', 'class', 'world', '19th', 'century', 'Europe', 'are', 'ever', 'likely', 'see', 'film', 'very', 'lack', 'fake', 'sentimentality', 'let', 'say', 'typical', 'Dickens', 'film.Why', 'great', 'picture', 'first', 'reason', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'Maria', 'Schell', 'Gervaise', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'small', 'laundry', 'business', 'trashed', 'alcoholic', 'abusive', 'husband', 'harsh', 'life', 'optimism', 'sheer', 'determination', 'are', 'touching', 'scenes', 'when', 'birthday', 'delicious', 'roast', 'goose', 'dripping', 'juice', 'shared', 'neighbors', 'friends', 'employees', 'when', 'kiss', 'lover', 'are', 'exciting', 'moments', 'when', 'vicious', 'cat-fight', 'laundress', 'husband', 'infidelity', 'poignant', 'last', 'scene', 'when', 'alcoholism', 'business', 'self-worth', 'ultimately', 'lost', 'fault', 'own.The', 'director', 'lot', 'attention', 'characters', 'rich', 'film', 'addition', 'Paris', 'scenes', 'are', 'unbelievably', 'realistic', 'down', 'cobblestones', 'worn', 'clothes', 'dirty', 'old', 'street', 'fronts', 'Zola', 'even', 'more', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'made', 'life', 'working', 'poor', 'vivid', 'print', 'Rene', 'Clement', 'should', 'be', 'congratulated', 'respecting', 'source', 'material', 'bringing', 'life', 'as', 'accurately', 'possible']",Essential Art House: Gervaise
