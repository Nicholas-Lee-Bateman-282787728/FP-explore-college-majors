However, I am glad that many others will now get to see it.  The film does not stray far from the book, something I also recommend.Within the gay community, there are concerns that the young, men, the happily out, etc. get center stage in media representations at the expense of others.  This work speaks to rarely mentioned audiences:  women, an older person, a closeted person in the military, and a person who had a heterosexual past.  Personally, I thought Glenn Close fit this role much better than she did the vampy personas in ""Fatal Attraction"" or ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses.""Too many people think that ""gays"" are constantly ""pushing their agenda.""  Here, we see that Cammermeyer came out only in order to be honest in an interview.  She had no intentions of becoming a spokesperson or an activist.  Her future daughter-in-law says something like, ""I plan on being nice to you despite your sin.""  I love that Cammermeyer challenged that half-buttockedness and said, ""I raised my kids, paid my taxes, and obeyed the law like everyone else.  This 'agreeing to disagree' won't cut it.""Because this was a made-for-TV movie, the places where commercials should be inserted will be obvious and may annoy some DVD viewers.  Still, this documents an issue that was big in the 1990s after AIDS was diagnosed in the 1980s and before Massachusetts allowed gay marriage in the 2000s.  I encourage many to view this.",3,M.

17139,AGRR05FH945HR,0767823923,Steven Cain,"[24, 25]","It is to the US Military's everlasting shame that they saw fit to persecute and expel a true decorated American war hero. War hero? Well what would you call an Army Nurse (24th Evac., Long Binh) who worked tirelessly to save the lives of teenage soldiers in an insanely busy surgical unit, where the word ""Incoming"" could mean more than the next influx of wounded.The movie understatedly captures how Cammermeyer (Bronze Star)and her nursing staff, and their Red Cross sisters (the Red Cross women still have no Vet status) risked their lives on a daily basis, never knowing when the next mortar round or 122mm rocket would slam into their Evac hospitals or MUSTs, or as with the 6th Convalescent Center at Cam Ranh Bay, when the VC sappers might attack directly.As a reality check, the first member of the Army Nurse Corps to be killed by direct enemy action was 1 / L Sharon Ann Lane, who died when a Russsian-made 8 inch diameter rocket struck Ward 4 of the 312th Evac at Chu Lai.8 Army Nurses died in Vietnam.That a true blue American woman, like Cammermeyer, who had given so much to so many should be driven out of the service that she loved because of something so pathetic as her orientation is perhaps the greatest indictment of a system that is full of double standards.Close and Davis were simply magnificent, and the only way in which this movie goes out to shock is by accurately telling this true tale of unimaginable injustice. The only obscenity lay in the outcome of the hearings.There have always been (...) in the military. Always. And there always will be. I was not one of them. I just don't like it when the bad guys win.There's a special place in Heaven for the women who served in Nam. All 15,000 of them.

The words at the end when she was describing that the gay community is all around everyone are so true. What would people that are anti gay think if they knew people around them could very well be gay and they don't even know it. Would they go into hiding to stay away from them. More people need to become educated before they judge and hate people they know nothing about. Heterosexual and homosexual lives parallel in many, many ways. The only thing really different about us is the fact that we love someone who is the same sex and they don't. Take the time to get to know someone, learn about them before you judge them.
