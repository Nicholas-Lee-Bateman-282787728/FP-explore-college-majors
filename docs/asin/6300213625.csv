In ""The Cage,"" a female second-in-command was too controversial for Starfleet, or at least for NBC, but season 3 gave us a female in command of her own ship. This one was Romulan, making us wonder -- were the Romulans more enlightened than us? And what a commander. Tough. Sexy. Alluring. Powerful. Seductive. And IN CHARGE. With more than a little fondness toward a certain Vulcan we know. Load up the photon torpedoes and beam us up!!!There were other controversies associated with this show. Originally it was intended as a re-telling of the Pueblo Incident, a tragic episode in the Vietnam era. In the original story, Starfleet orders the Enterprise across the Neutral Zone for no very good reason, and the crew suffers humiliating capture as a result. The revised script changes the ending. Which raises a question -- what was the purpose of the series? To show that an advanced, international version of the American Way would triumph in the galaxy... or to examine the American Way and critique its shortcomings? I think it did both. But re-telling the Pueblo Incident would have perhaps been too sensitive in the 1960s -- though fascinating to see now.Another controversy was the handling of the love scene between Spock and the Romulan commander (Joanna Linville). Nimoy was adamant that this not be played like a Terran love scene, meaning no touching. In the version that was shot, there was touching... but of the Vulcan variety, with hands touching foreheads, and no kissing. It strikes me today as effective and appropriate.",4,Romulan Sex Appeal,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,1551,"['ironic', 'Cage', 'female', 'second-in-command', 'was', 'too', 'controversial', 'Starfleet', 'least', 'NBC', 'season', '3', 'gave', 'female', 'command', 'own', 'ship', 'one', 'was', 'Romulan', 'making', 'wonder', 'were', 'Romulans', 'more', 'enlightened', 'what', 'commander', 'Tough', 'Sexy', 'Alluring', 'Powerful', 'Seductive', 'IN', 'CHARGE', 'more', 'little', 'fondness', 'certain', 'Vulcan', 'know', 'Load', 'photon', 'torpedoes', 'beam', 'up', 'were', 'other', 'controversies', 'associated', 'show', 'Originally', 'was', 'intended', 're-telling', 'Pueblo', 'Incident', 'tragic', 'episode', 'Vietnam', 'era', 'original', 'story', 'Starfleet', 'orders', 'Enterprise', 'Neutral', 'Zone', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'crew', 'suffers', 'humiliating', 'capture', 'result', 'revised', 'script', 'ending', 'Which', 'question', 'was', 'purpose', 'series', 'show', 'advanced', 'international', 'version', 'American', 'Way', 'would', 'triumph', 'galaxy', 'examine', 'American', 'Way', 'critique', 'shortcomings', 'think', 'did', 're-telling', 'Pueblo', 'Incident', 'would', 'have', 'perhaps', 'been', 'too', 'sensitive', '1960s', 'fascinating', 'see', 'now.Another', 'controversy', 'was', 'handling', 'love', 'scene', 'Spock', 'Romulan', 'commander', 'Joanna', 'Linville', 'Nimoy', 'was', 'adamant', 'not', 'be', 'played', 'Terran', 'love', 'scene', 'meaning', 'touching', 'version', 'was', 'shot', 'was', 'touching', 'Vulcan', 'variety', 'hands', 'touching', 'foreheads', 'kissing', 'today', 'effective', 'appropriate']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 59: The Enterprise Incident VHS"
207946,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6300213625,Charles Ashbacher,"[3, 3]","This is one of the best episodes of the original series, in terms of storyline, acting and the visual presentation. Captain Kirk is showing signs of stress and he inexplicably orders the Enterprise into the neutral zone between Federation and Romulan space. Almost immediately, several Romulan ships appear from nowhere and surround the Enterprise. The Romulan commander then makes contact and demands the immediate surrender of the Enterprise.Spock surmises that the Romulans have developed a cloaking device that renders them invisible and notes that they would not be in the situation if captain Kirk had not ordered the Enterprise into the neutral zone. Kirk and Spock beam over to the Romulan command ship and Spock informs the commander that the Enterprise is not on a Federation mission, but entered the neutral zone on the sole basis of Kirk's orders. Spock also says that Kirk has exhibited instability recently and the strain of command has caused him to issue inappropriate orders. Therefore, Kirk alone should be held responsible, the Enterprise crew and Starfleet command are blameless. Kirk responds with anger and attacks Spock. Caught off guard, Spock inadvertently uses the Vulcan death grip to defend himself.Spock then falls in love with the female Romulan commander and McCoy beams over to the Romulan ship to retrieve Kirk's body. It all turns out to be a ruse, Kirk and Spock are under Federation orders to obtain the cloaking device. There is no Vulcan death grip and while Spock occupies the Romulan commander, Kirk beams over to the Romulan ship, retrieves the cloaking device and beams back to the Enterprise. Spock's espionage is discovered and he is scheduled for execution. He is recovered from the Romulan ship and the Enterprise flees. Scotty manages to install the cloaking device on the Enterprise, and this allows the Enterprise to escape.William Shatner is excellent as the stressed out Kirk and Joanne Linville is superb as the Romulan commander. Having a female play the role of the commander was a stroke of genius. Considering that this was the late sixties, a female in charge of anything was a revolutionary concept. It was no surprise to me that the episode was written by Dorothy (D. C.) Fontana. One of the best scenes in the original series is when Scotty stomps into sick bay in response to a summons by McCoy only to encounter Kirk transformed into a Romulan. The only weak spot is how quickly the Romulan commander falls for Spock's apparent defection, as they did not even confiscate his communicator. Nevertheless, this episode is easily placed in the top ten when ranking the episodes of the original series.",5,"Female Romulan commander, stroke of genius",1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,2659,"['one', 'best', 'episodes', 'original', 'series', 'terms', 'storyline', 'acting', 'visual', 'presentation', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'showing', 'signs', 'stress', 'inexplicably', 'orders', 'Enterprise', 'neutral', 'zone', 'Federation', 'Romulan', 'space', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'several', 'Romulan', 'ships', 'appear', 'nowhere', 'surround', 'Enterprise', 'Romulan', 'commander', 'then', 'contact', 'immediate', 'surrender', 'Enterprise.Spock', 'Romulans', 'have', 'developed', 'cloaking', 'device', 'invisible', 'notes', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'situation', 'captain', 'Kirk', 'had', 'not', 'ordered', 'Enterprise', 'neutral', 'zone', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'beam', 'Romulan', 'command', 'ship', 'Spock', 'commander', 'Enterprise', 'not', 'Federation', 'mission', 'entered', 'neutral', 'zone', 'sole', 'basis', 'Kirk', 'orders', 'Spock', 'also', 'Kirk', 'exhibited', 'instability', 'recently', 'strain', 'command', 'caused', 'issue', 'inappropriate', 'orders', 'Therefore', 'Kirk', 'alone', 'should', 'be', 'held', 'responsible', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'Starfleet', 'command', 'are', 'blameless', 'Kirk', 'anger', 'attacks', 'Spock', 'Caught', 'off', 'guard', 'Spock', 'inadvertently', 'Vulcan', 'death', 'grip', 'defend', 'himself.Spock', 'then', 'love', 'female', 'Romulan', 'commander', 'McCoy', 'beams', 'Romulan', 'ship', 'retrieve', 'Kirk', 'body', 'out', 'be', 'ruse', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'are', 'Federation', 'orders', 'obtain', 'cloaking', 'device', 'Vulcan', 'death', 'grip', 'Spock', 'Romulan', 'commander', 'Kirk', 'Romulan', 'ship', 'cloaking', 'device', 'beams', 'back', 'Enterprise', 'Spock', 'espionage', 'discovered', 'scheduled', 'execution', 'recovered', 'Romulan', 'ship', 'Enterprise', 'flees', 'Scotty', 'install', 'cloaking', 'device', 'Enterprise', 'Enterprise', 'escape.William', 'Shatner', 'excellent', 'stressed', 'out', 'Kirk', 'Joanne', 'Linville', 'superb', 'Romulan', 'commander', 'Having', 'female', 'play', 'role', 'commander', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius', 'Considering', 'was', 'late', 'sixties', 'female', 'charge', 'anything', 'was', 'revolutionary', 'concept', 'was', 'surprise', 'episode', 'was', 'written', 'Dorothy', 'D.', 'C.', 'Fontana', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'original', 'series', 'when', 'Scotty', 'sick', 'bay', 'response', 'summons', 'McCoy', 'only', 'encounter', 'Kirk', 'transformed', 'Romulan', 'only', 'weak', 'spot', 'how', 'quickly', 'Romulan', 'commander', 'Spock', 'apparent', 'defection', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'confiscate', 'communicator', 'Nevertheless', 'episode', 'easily', 'placed', 'top', 'ten', 'when', 'ranking', 'episodes', 'original', 'series']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 59: The Enterprise Incident VHS"

Enterprise into Romulan  space and the ship is immediately surrounded by Romulan warships. Kirk and  Spock beam aboard the Romulan flag-ship and confront the Romulan  Commander, a woman. Kirk explains that his ship entered Romulan territory  because of equipment malfunction. Spock, however, denounces this  explanation,  saying Kirk ordered them here, due to his reduced mental  stability. This, not  surprisingly, enrages the Captain. The Romulan  Commander orders the U.S.S.  Enterprise be taken to the Romulan base.  Scotty, placed in command of the  starship, refuses. McCoy is beamed aboard  the flag-ship to tend Kirk, who has  become irrational to the point of  violence. When he arrives, Kirk attacks Spock who  reacts, without  thinking, by using the Vulcan death grip, killing Kirk.  McCoy returns to  the U.S.S. Enterprise with Kirk's body, while Spock remains on the  Romulan  ship. Unknown to the Romulan Commander, this has all been a ploy to  sneak  the officers on board and steal the Romulan cloaking device. After Kirk's  body  has been removed to his ship, the Romulan Commander begins to try and  entice  Spock into defecting to the Romulan side.  Disguised as a Romulan,  Kirk returns to the Romulan ship and steals the vessel's  cloaking device  and returns with it to the U.S.S. Enterprise. When the Commander  discovers  the theft, she feels betrayed and in retaliation decides to execute Spock.  The Vulcan pretends to confess to her and ultimately stalls until Scotty is  able to  install the cloaking device on board the U.S.S. Enterprise. Spock  is beamed back  aboard the starship, but since the Romulan Commander was  standing near him,  she is also beamed aboard.  The Romulan Subcommander,  now in charge of the flag-ship, gives chase, ordered  by his commander to  destroy the Federation ship. Fortunately, the newly-installed  cloaking  device works and the U.S.S. Enterprise makes good her escape, with the  Romulan Commander on board a their prisoner.",4,Gets a B+ grade and is in the Top 25,940291200,"10 19, 1999",1999,2045,"['Seeming', 'tense', 'erratic', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'U.S.S', 'Enterprise', 'Romulan', 'space', 'ship', 'immediately', 'surrounded', 'Romulan', 'warships', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'beam', 'Romulan', 'flag-ship', 'confront', 'Romulan', 'Commander', 'woman', 'Kirk', 'ship', 'entered', 'Romulan', 'territory', 'equipment', 'malfunction', 'Spock', 'however', 'explanation', 'saying', 'Kirk', 'ordered', 'here', 'due', 'reduced', 'mental', 'stability', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'Captain', 'Romulan', 'Commander', 'orders', 'U.S.S', 'Enterprise', 'be', 'taken', 'Romulan', 'base', 'Scotty', 'placed', 'command', 'starship', 'McCoy', 'beamed', 'flag-ship', 'tend', 'Kirk', 'who', 'become', 'irrational', 'point', 'violence', 'When', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'who', 'thinking', 'using', 'Vulcan', 'death', 'grip', 'killing', 'Kirk', 'McCoy', 'U.S.S', 'Enterprise', 'Kirk', 'body', 'Spock', 'Romulan', 'ship', 'Romulan', 'Commander', 'been', 'ploy', 'sneak', 'officers', 'board', 'steal', 'Romulan', 'cloaking', 'device', 'Kirk', 'body', 'been', 'removed', 'ship', 'Romulan', 'Commander', 'try', 'entice', 'Spock', 'defecting', 'Romulan', 'side', 'Disguised', 'Romulan', 'Kirk', 'Romulan', 'ship', 'vessel', 'cloaking', 'device', 'returns', 'U.S.S', 'Enterprise', 'When', 'Commander', 'theft', 'betrayed', 'retaliation', 'decides', 'execute', 'Spock', 'Vulcan', 'pretends', 'confess', 'ultimately', 'stalls', 'Scotty', 'able', 'install', 'cloaking', 'device', 'board', 'U.S.S', 'Enterprise', 'Spock', 'beamed', 'back', 'starship', 'Romulan', 'Commander', 'was', 'standing', 'also', 'beamed', 'aboard', 'Romulan', 'Subcommander', 'now', 'charge', 'flag-ship', 'chase', 'ordered', 'commander', 'destroy', 'Federation', 'ship', 'Fortunately', 'newly-installed', 'cloaking', 'device', 'works', 'U.S.S', 'Enterprise', 'good', 'escape', 'Romulan', 'Commander', 'board', 'prisoner']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 59: The Enterprise Incident VHS"
207948,A2BSZPRBKYAB2K,6300213625,"Joe Owen ""Joe""","[8, 8]",The Enterprise Incident in my opinion is one of the top 5 episodes in the original series.  I always like it when the Romulans or Klingons appear in the Star Trek Series be it The Next Generation or Deep Space Nine or Voyager.  But the original series really gets it right when it came to the Romulans (not only this epiode but in the episode &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;). This episode begins with the Enterprise crossing the Neutral Zone which is like the Iron Curtain during the Cold War between the USA and USSR.What the Enterprise is doing in Romulan Territory is anyone's guess until the last 20 minutes or so.  Several twists in the plot occur and it is suspensful from the beginning to the end.The Romulan Commander is played by the beautiful Joanne Linville and she gives an unforgettable performance.Highly recommended to all Star Trek fans!,5,One of the best episodes of the original series,999561600,"09 4, 2001",2001,852,"['Enterprise', 'Incident', 'opinion', 'one', 'top', '5', 'episodes', 'original', 'series', 'always', 'when', 'Romulans', 'Klingons', 'appear', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Series', 'be', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Voyager', 'original', 'series', 'really', 'right', 'when', 'came', 'Romulans', 'not', 'only', 'epiode', 'episode', 'quot', 'Balance', 'Terror', 'quot', 'episode', 'Enterprise', 'crossing', 'Neutral', 'Zone', 'Iron', 'Curtain', 'Cold', 'War', 'USA', 'USSR.What', 'Enterprise', 'doing', 'Romulan', 'Territory', 'anyone', 'guess', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'Several', 'twists', 'plot', 'occur', 'suspensful', 'beginning', 'end.The', 'Romulan', 'Commander', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Joanne', 'Linville', 'unforgettable', 'performance.Highly', 'recommended', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fans']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 59: The Enterprise Incident VHS"

I remember how startled I was when she first appeared:  a  woman, and commanding a fleet of her own!  A woman with passion, ambition,  and force.Over the course of thirty years now, I've alternated between  wishing she -- and the script writers -- had been kept more aloof; there  are times when I have hated to see her made a fool of.  And then, there are  times when I admire the character for keeping to her own agenda, even at  the risk of her life and honor.Perhaps this episode's greatest triumph  is that it keeps viewers guessing and wishing they knew what happened  next.We've tried in VULCAN'S HEART to give our own ideas about that.
